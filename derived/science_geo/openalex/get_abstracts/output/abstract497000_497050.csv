Solar cells could also be used to make hydrogen from water, which can be stored as a fuel. Separating water into hydrogen and oxygen, however, presents challenges, especially if this is done directly by illuminating the anode that oxides water. Under the acidic or alkaline conditions needed for practical devices, semiconducting anode materials corrode during operation. Hu et al. now show that amorphous titanium dioxide coatings can protect semiconductors from alkaline corrosion while still allowing light through. Science , this issue p. 1005"

Glutamate is an important neurotransmitter that excites the receiving nerve cell by binding to an ion channel called an N -Methyl- d -Aspartate (NMDA) receptor. This activates the NMDA receptors, causing calcium ions to flood in, triggering signal transduction. Either under- or overactivation can result in a variety of neurological disorders and diseases. Karakas and Furukawa describe the crystal structure of an intact NMDA receptor composed of four separate subunits. Science , this issue p. 992"

Falke et al. show that molecular vibrations smooth the way for this charge transfer to proceed. A combination of ultrafast spectroscopy and theoretical simulations revealed an oscillatory signal in a model donor/acceptor blend that implicates carbon-carbon bond stretching in concert with the electronic transition. This vibrational/electronic, or vibronic, process maintains a quantum-mechanical phase relationship that guides the charge more rapidly and directly than an incoherent migration from donor to acceptor.

Gertler et al. looked at the earnings of young adults in Jamaica, 20 years after, as toddlers, they were given 2 years of help from community health workers. The earnings of the treatment group caught up to those of a comparison group of well-fed children, but the control group of undernourished children that did not receive the health worker visits has lagged behind.

However, nucleic acids extracted from FFPE tissues are fragmented and chemically modified making them challenging to use in molecular studies. We analysed 23 fresh-frozen (FF), 35 FFPE and 38 paired FF/FFPE specimens, representing six different human tissue types (bladder, prostate and colon carcinoma; liver and colon normal tissue; reactive tonsil) in order to examine the potential use of FFPE samples in next-generation sequencing (NGS) based retrospective and prospective clinical studies. Two methods for DNA and three methods for RNA extraction from FFPE tissues were compared and were found to affect nucleic acid quantity and quality. DNA and RNA from selected FFPE and paired FF/FFPE specimens were used for exome and transcriptome analysis. Preparations of DNA Exome-Seq libraries was more challenging (29.5% success) than that of RNA-Seq libraries, presumably because of modifications to FFPE tissue-derived DNA. Libraries could still be prepared from RNA isolated from two-decade old FFPE tissues. Data were analysed using the CLC Bio Genomics Workbench and revealed systematic differences between FF and FFPE tissue-derived nucleic acid libraries. In spite of this, pairwise analysis of DNA Exome-Seq data showed concordance for 70–80% of variants in FF and FFPE samples stored for fewer than three years. RNA-Seq data showed high correlation of expression profiles in FF/FFPE pairs (Pearson Correlations of 0.90 +/- 0.05), irrespective of storage time (up to 244 months) and tissue type. A common set of 1,494 genes was identified with expression profiles that were significantly different between paired FF and FFPE samples irrespective of tissue type. Our results are promising and suggest that NGS can be used to study FFPE specimens in both prospective and retrospective archive-based studies in which FF specimens are not available."

At very short time scales, thermal motions probably dominate, whereas on time scales from minutes to hours, motor-protein-12–based directed transport is dominant. But what about the times in between? Fakhri et al. tracked kinesin molecules labeled with carbon nanotubes and monitored their motion in living cells for milliseconds to hours. The kinesins motored along microtubule tracks, but sometimes moved more randomly as the tracks themselves were moved by active, larger-scale cell movements. This active “stirring” of the cytoplasm may play a role in nonspecific transport. Science , this issue p. 1031"

The ceramide-to-S1P pathway is also implicated in the development of pain, raising the intriguing possibility that these sphingolipids may contribute to chemotherapy-induced painful peripheral neuropathy, which can be a critical dose-limiting side effect of many widely used chemotherapeutic agents. We demonstrate that the development of paclitaxel-induced neuropathic pain was associated with ceramide and S1P formation in the spinal dorsal horn that corresponded with the engagement of S1P receptor subtype 1 (S1PR1)-dependent neuroinflammatory processes as follows: activation of redox-sensitive transcription factors (NFκB) and MAPKs (ERK and p38) as well as enhanced formation of pro-inflammatory and neuroexcitatory cytokines (TNF-α and IL-1β).

https://openalex.org/W1995562255,"The inhibitory action of lignin on cellulase cocktails is a major challenge to the biological saccharification of plant cell wall polysaccharides. Although the mechanism remains unclear, hydrophobic interactions between enzymes and lignin are hypothesized to drive adsorption. Here we evaluate the role of hydrophobic interactions in enzyme-lignin binding. The hydrophobicity of the enzyme surface was quantified using an estimation of the clustering of nonpolar atoms, identifying potential interaction sites. The adsorption of enzymes to lignin surfaces, measured using the quartz crystal microbalance, correlates to the hydrophobic cluster scores. Further, these results suggest a minimum hydrophobic cluster size for a protein to preferentially adsorb to lignin. The impact of electrostatic contribution was ruled out by comparing the isoelectric point (pI) values to the adsorption of proteins to lignin surfaces. These results demonstrate the ability to predict enzyme-lignin adsorption and could potentially be used to design improved cellulase cocktails, thus lowering the overall cost of biofuel production.

These results demonstrate the ability to predict enzyme-lignin adsorption and could potentially be used to design improved cellulase cocktails, thus lowering the overall cost of biofuel production. Currently the cost of enzymes required for enzymatic digestion of biomass is a significant part of the total cost of producing lignocellulosic fuel; a recent techno-economic estimation attributes a cost of $1.47/gallon of ethanol produced from corn stover to enzyme production (1Klein-Marcuschamer D. Oleskowicz-Popiel P. Simmons B.A. Blanch H.W. The challenge of enzyme cost in the production of lignocellulosic biofuels.Biotechnol. Bioeng. 2012; 109: 1083-1087Crossref PubMed Scopus (723) Google Scholar). The inhibitory effect of lignin is known to decrease the performance of cellulase cocktails and results in the need for high enzyme loadings. Nonproductive adsorption of cellulases to lignin is hypothesized to be a source of inhibition, yet the mechanisms driving enzyme adsorption have not been elucidated. This study is aimed at understanding the factors contributing to lignin inhibition and proposing solutions to advance the development of enzyme cocktails by reducing nonspecific binding to lignin. Lignin is a polymer of cross-linked phenylpropane units, conferring hydrophobicity, structural rigidity, and microbial resistance to plant cell walls. The physical properties of lignin, which can vary among different plant sources and result from different pretreatment methods, can influence enzyme adsorption capacity. The hydrophilic carboxylic acid functionality in lignin samples correlates with enzymatic hydrolysis of lignocellulosic substrates, suggesting that some chemical properties of lignin may reduce enzyme adsorption to lignin (2Nakagame S. Chandra R.P. Kadla J.F. Saddler J.N. Enhancing the enzymatic hydrolysis of lignocellulosic biomass by increasing the carboxylic acid content of the associated lignin.Biotechnol. Bioeng. 2011; 108: 538-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Attempts to genetically engineer plants for altered lignin biosynthesis can result in the incorporation of unusual phenylpropane units, such as coniferaldehyde, leading to an increase in hydrophobicity (3Grabber J.H. How do lignin composition, structure, and cross-linking affect degradability? A review of cell wall model studies.Crop Sci. 2005; 45: 820-831Crossref Scopus (412) Google Scholar). This increased hydrophobicity in genetically engineered plants has led to a decrease in digestibility of the cell wall. Thus, although the mechanism of enzymatic inhibition by lignin is not fully understood, hydrophobicity appears to have a strong role. Research of enzyme adsorption to lignin has focused on several mechanisms. The role of electrostatic interactions was investigated by comparing enzyme adsorption and protein pI values, but the results are inconclusive because both positively and negatively charged proteins were found to adsorb to lignin (4Nakagame S. Chandra R.P. Kadla J.F. Saddler J.N. The isolation, characterization and effect of lignin isolated from steam pretreated Douglas-fir on the enzymatic hydrolysis of cellulose.Bioresour. Technol. 2011; 102: 4507-4517Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). The role of the carbohydrate-binding module (CBM), 3The abbreviations used are: CBMcarbohydrate-binding modulePDBProtein Data BankAbfBα-l-arabinofuranosidase BQCM-Dquartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoringIEFisoelectric focusingSASAsolvent-accessible surface area. found in many cellulase enzymes and important for targeting enzyme to substrate, was shown to enhance enzyme adsorption to lignin (5Rahikainen J.L.

Technol. 2013; 133: 270-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). However, another study utilizing a mixture of cellulase enzymes found β-glucosidase, which does not have a CBM, preferentially adsorbs to lignin (6Haven M.O. Jørgensen H.

Enzymatic hydrolysis of lignocellulosic biomass can be enhanced by the inclusion of various protein and chemical additives. BSA has been used as a nonenzymatic protein additive to enhance glucose yields in enzymatic hydrolysis (7Brethauer S. Studer M.H. Yang B. Wyman C.E.

Bioeng. 2006; 94: 611-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar), based on its propensity to nonspecifically bind hydrophobic steroid hormones, hemin, and fatty acids (9Zunszain P.A. Ghuman J. Komatsu T. Tsuchida E. Curry S. Crystal structural analysis of human serum albumin complexed with hemin and fatty acid.BMC Struct. Biol. 2003; 3: 6Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A study assessing exposed hydrophobic regions of 112 soluble, monomeric proteins identifies BSA near the top for the amount of exposed hydrophobic surface regions (10Lijnzaad P. Berendsen H.J. Argos P. Hydrophobic patches on the surfaces of protein structures.Proteins. 1996; 25: 389-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Yang and co-workers (7Brethauer S. Studer M.H. Yang B. Wyman C.E. The effect of bovine serum albumin on batch and continuous enzymatic cellulose hydrolysis mixed by stirring or shaking.Bioresour. Technol. 2011; 102: 6295-6298Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) showed that BSA adsorbs more strongly to pretreated corn stover, which contains both cellulose and lignin, than to model cellulose. Additionally, an enhancement of enzymatic hydrolysis upon the addition of BSA is seen for pretreated corn stover but not for model cellulose. The results imply that adsorption to lignin is the mechanism for inhibition and that added BSA binds to lignin, preventing cellulase binding. Similar enhancements to enzymatic hydrolysis of lignocellulosic biomass have been seen upon the addition of nonionic surfactants such as Tween detergents, polyethylene glycol 4000, or dodecylbenzene sulfonic acid (11Qing Q. Yang B. Wyman C.E. Impact of surfactants on pretreatment of corn stover.Bioresour. Technol. 2010; 101: 5941-5951Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 12Eriksson T. Borjesson J. Tjerneld F.

Navarro A.A. Ballesteros M. Effect of surfactants and zeolites on simultaneous saccharification and fermentation of steam-exploded poplar biomass to ethanol.Appl. Biochem.

Technol. 1994; 49: 247-251Crossref Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Numerous mechanisms could lead to the enhancement effect including 1) increasing protein stability, 2) altering lignin structure, and 3) altering enzyme-lignin interaction. Addressing these proposed mechanisms, Eriksson et al. (12Eriksson T. Borjesson J. Tjerneld F. Mechanism of surfactant effect in enzymatic hydrolysis of lignocellulose.Enzyme Microb. Tech. 2002; 31: 353-364Crossref Scopus (759) Google Scholar) found surfactants have very little effect on the thermal stability of Trichoderma reesei Cel7A but did enhance the hydrolysis of lignocellulose while not improving model cellulose hydrolysis. These results coincided with a decrease in enzyme adsorption to lignin. These observations are in agreement with BSA results, and support the role of surfactants in attenuating nonproductive enzyme adsorption to lignin. Furthermore, the results support the hypothesis that enzymes interact with lignin through a hydrophobic mechanism. Although lignin adsorption is likely to have other dependences, if hydrophobicity is a significant contributor then hydrophobic surface properties could determine how strongly various enzymes adsorb to lignin. Additionally, protein engineers might have a clear and rational approach to mitigate these undesired interactions. Lijnzaad et al. developed a method to delineate contiguous hydrophobic patches on a protein surface (16Lijnzaad P. Berendsen H.J. Argos P. A method for detecting hydrophobic patches on protein surfaces.Proteins. 1996; 26: 192-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Briefly, all nonpolar atoms with nonzero solvent-accessible surface area (SASA) are assigned to be nodes on a graph, and edges are placed between nodes if there is exposed overlap between atoms. Jacak et al. (17Jacak R. Leaver-Fay A. Kuhlman B. Computational protein design with explicit consideration of surface hydrophobic patches.Proteins. 2012; 80: 825-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) incorporated a similar method into the protein design software, Rosetta, adding a scoring function specifically designed to identify larger hydrophobic patches. The Rosetta hydrophobic patch score works by assigning a score to each identified patch, with scores increasing exponentially with increasing patch size. Here we take a systematic approach to evaluate the surface properties of a select set of proteins for comparison to measured adsorption to lignin surfaces. The method developed by Jacak et al. is used to rank-order each protein by degree of surface hydrophobicity. Then the strength of the interactions between enzymes and lignin films is evaluated using quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring (QCM-D). QCM-D enables real-time measurements of enzyme adsorption to substrate films. Comparing surface properties for the studied set of enzymes to adsorption information provides information on how well the hydrophobic patch score predicts degree of binding. We describe enzyme interactions with lignin isolated from switchgrass via an organosolv process as an example of a biomass pretreatment process potentially useful in biofuel production. Surface properties of individual enzymes were evaluated using the protein design software, Rosetta (18Kuhlman B. Baker D. Native protein sequences are close to optimal for their structures.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2000; 97: 10383-10388Crossref PubMed Scopus (675) Google Scholar, 19Rohl C.A. Strauss C.E. Misura K.M. Baker D. Protein structure prediction using Rosetta.Methods Enzymol. 2004; 383: 66-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (1275) Google Scholar). Rosetta was used to identify and score clusters of hydrophobic atoms, referred to as hydrophobic patches (17Jacak R. Leaver-Fay A. Kuhlman B. Computational protein design with explicit consideration of surface hydrophobic patches.Proteins. 2012; 80: 825-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Additionally, hydrophobic and hydrophilic solvent-accessible surface area was computed for each structure using VADAR (Volume, Area, Dihedral Angle Reporter) (20Willard L. Ranjan A. Zhang H. Monzavi H. Boyko R.F. Sykes B.D. Wishart D.S. VADAR: a web server for quantitative evaluation of protein structure quality.Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3316-3319Crossref PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar).

Purification of XynA consisted of solubilizing the protein in 20 mm Tris buffer, pH 8.0, followed by centrifugation to remove the protein from the flour (Pentopan® is a baking additive) and subjecting the clarified supernatant to anion exchange chromatography on a Source15Q 10/100 Tricorn chromatography column (GE Healthcare) with a 0.0 to 1.0 m sodium chloride gradient in 20 mm Bis-Tris buffer, pH 8.0. Active fractions were pooled, concentrated by 5-kDa Vivaflow spin concentrators (Millipore), and subjected to size exclusion chromatography on a 26/60 Superdex 75 column in 20 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.0, 100 mm sodium chloride. A. cellulolyticus endoglucanase E1 (Cel5A) was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 as a truncated gene (CBM and linker delete) with a Tyr to Gly mutation at sequence position 245 (E1cdY245G). The protein was purified as described previously (24Baker J.O. McCarley J.R. Lovett R. Yu C.H. Adney W.S. Rignall T.R. Vinzant T.B. Decker S.R. Sakon J. Himmel M.E. Catalytically enhanced endocellulase Cel5A from Acidothermus cellulolyticus.Appl. Biochem. Biotechnol. 2005; 121–124: 129-148Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). T. reesei AxeI was expressed in Aspergillus awamori and purified using combinations of hydrophobic interaction, anion exchange, and size exclusion FPLC as described previously (34Selig M.J. Knoshaug E.P. Adney W.S. Himmel M.E. Decker S.R. Synergistic enhancement of cellobiohydrolase performance on pretreated corn stover by addition of xylanase and esterase activities.Bioresour. Technol. 2008; 99: 4997-5005Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). α-l-Arabinofuranosidase B (AbfB) from A. niger was expressed in and purified from A. awamori grown in CM-maltose medium at 30 °C, with shaking, for 6 days. Culture broth was filtered stepwise through Miracloth and 2.7-, 1.5-, 0.7-, and 0.45-μm filters, concentrated, and the buffer-exchanged into 20 mm Bis-Tris, pH 6.8, through a PES filter with 5-kDa cutoff (Pall Life Sciences). Buffer-exchanged broth proteins were separated by anion exchange using HiTrap Q Sepharose HP column (GE Healthcare) with a 0.0 to 1.0 m sodium chloride gradient in 20 mm Bis-Tris, pH 6.8. AbfB was followed by activity on o-nitrophenyl-α-l-arabinofuranoside (Sigma), and molecular mass as determined by SDS-Page on a 4 to 12% polyacrylamide gradient gel (Invitrogen). AbfB fractions were pooled and diluted in high salt buffer (4.0 m (NH4)2SO4 20 mm Bis-Tris, pH 6.8) to a final salt concentration of 2.0 m (NH4)2SO4 for purification by HiTrap phenyl Sepharose HP hydrophobic interaction column (GE Healthcare) with a gradient of 2.0 to 0 m (NH4)2SO4. AbfB fractions were pooled and subjected to size exclusion chromatography on a 26/50 Superdex 75 column in 20 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.0, 100 mm sodium chloride, 10% glycerol. T. reesei Cel7A was expressed and purified as previously described (37Jeoh T. Michener W. Himmel M.E. Decker S.R. Adney W.S. Implications of cellobiohydrolase glycosylation for use in biomass conversion.Biotechnol. Biofuels. 2008; 1: 10Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All enzymes were buffer-exchanged into 25 mΜ sodium citrate, pH 4.8, 50 mm sodium chloride using HiPrep desalting columns (GE Healthcare). All enzymes were brought to a final concentration of 5 μm. Switchgrass (Panicum virgatum) was collected from an established stand of Alamo variety grown in East Tennessee, air-dried, and comminuted in a 1-inch knife mill to give material ∼1–2” in length. Switchgrass fractionation was carried out by loading ∼430 g of switchgrass into a perforated Teflon basket and placing the basket in a Hastelloy C276 flowthrough pressure reactor. The reactor was sealed and placed under vacuum for 30 min. A single-phase mixture of methyl isobutyl ketone, ethanol, and water (16/34/50 w/w/w) in the presence of 0.1 m sulfuric acid as a catalyst was pulled into the reactor under vacuum and heated to 160 °C. Additional solvent was pumped through the system into a collection tank for 120 min at a rate sufficient to generate ∼7–8 liters of black liquor. Upon completion of the run, the solvent remaining in the reactor was carefully released into the collection tank and mixed with the black liquor collected during the run. The black liquor was mixed with solid NaCl (10 g/100 ml of water contained in solvent mixture) in a separatory funnel, shaken, and allowed to stand for 30 min to generate aqueous and organic phases. The layers were separated, and the organic layer was washed once with ∼50% (v/v) water. The layers were separated and the organic layer was washed a second time with ∼75% (v/v) water. Lignin was isolated from the organic fraction by solvent removal on the rotary evaporator. The resulting lignin residue was triturated with diethyl ether. After decanting the ether, the lignin was placed under vacuum. The trituration step was repeated as necessary to give a free flowing brown powder. Ethanol contained in the combined aqueous fractions from the washing was removed on the rotary evaporator to precipitate a second lignin fraction that was isolated by filtration through a double layer of filter paper in a Büchner funnel and dried under vacuum to give a free flowing brown powder. Thin films of lignin were used as substrates for the QCM-D studies. The QCM resonators consist of 5 MHz-AT cut quartz crystals sensors between two conductive gold layers with an upper coating of SiO2 (Q-Sense Style, Fil-Tech). The sensors were first cleaned with water and ethanol rinses followed by argon ion plasma treatments. Cleaned QCM-D sensors were then spin coated at 2,000 rpm for 60 s with 100 μl of 1 mg/ml of lignin dissolved in 9:1 dioxane:water. A Q-Sense E4 (Biolin Scientific AB, Stockholm, Sweden) was used to study enzyme adsorption to lignin films deposited on the sensors. QCM-D measures both the change in frequency, Δf, and the change in dissipation, ΔD, of the quartz crystal. The temperature in our experiments was controlled to within ±0.02 °C by a Peltier element within the QCM instrument. For all binding experiments, bare quartz sensors were characterized in both air and buffer solution to measure their fundamental frequencies. Following this, the sensors were coated with lignin and characterized to measure the new fundamental frequencies, allowing the mass of the lignin films to be calculated. Odd harmonic overtones were collected, and the third harmonic overtone was used to estimate the rates of adsorption. Enzyme adsorption was monitored while flowing enzyme solution over the sensors for 25 min at a rate of 0.1 ml/min. Changes in dissipation were used to evaluate rigidity of the protein layer deposited on lignin surfaces. Changes in areal mass, Δm, were modeled using the Voigt viscoelastic model (38Voinova M.V. Rodahl M. Jonson M. Kasemo B. Viscoelastic acoustic response of layered polymer films at fluid-solid interfaces: continuum mechanics approach.Phys. Scripta. 1999; 59: 391-396Crossref Scopus (1299) Google Scholar). The areal mass values obtained using the Voigt model generally agreed with the areal mass values obtained using the Sauerbrey equation, although the Sauerbrey equation did systematically under predict mass for about half of the proteins, which is a known limitation of the Sauerbrey model (39Dutta A.K. Nayak A. Belfort G. Viscoelastic properties of adsorbed and cross-linked polypeptide and protein layers at a solid-liquid interface.J. Colloid Interface Sci. 2008; 324: 55-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The use of the Voigt viscoelastic model allowed for the estimation of the thickness for the adsorbed protein layer for A. niger BglI. The mass in all binding curves reached a plateau by 25 min, indicating saturation of binding. The binding capacity was therefore taken to be the areal mass value (ng/cm2) at 25 min. Changes in frequency were fitted to an exponential decay function to model the initial enzyme adsorption rate as described by Turon et al. (40Turon X. Rojas O.J. Deinhammer R.S. Enzymatic kinetics of cellulose hydrolysis: a QCM-D study.Langmuir. 2008; 24: 3880-3887Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). The adsorption kinetics for nearly all proteins evaluated in this work did not fit to a single exponential. The use of a double-exponential equation improved the fit to the adsorption curve for many but not all of the proteins. Therefore, to provide a consistent method that could be applied to all proteins, the initial adsorption rate for each enzyme to the lignin films was determined using the limiting slope method (see Table 2). A range of greater than 20-fold is seen in the enzyme adsorption rates (Hz/min), with BSA as the fastest adsorbing protein and XynA as the slowest.TABLE 2QCM-D measured adsorption parameters for proteins on lignin surfacesAdsorbed massStandard deviation of change in massRate of adsorptionStandard deviation rateng/cm2Hz/minBgl11155.6 (1170.6)10.68.2 (6.8)1.0BSA643.3 (631.7)8.221.3 (21.2)0.1Cel7A294.6 (285.8)6.28.3 (6.3)1.4Axe1263.4 (245.3)12.810.1 (11.7)1.1E1193.2 (192.5)0.53.9 (3.8)0.1AbfB170.5 (191.5)14.82.6 (1.5)0.8XynII172.2 (162.1)7.11.5 (2.2)0.5XynA69.7 (69.4)0.21.0 (0.6)0.3 Open table in a new tab The pI for each protein was determined using a pH 3–10 isoelectric focusing (IEF) gel (Invitrogen) with a Novex IEF Marker 3–10 standard. The loading buffer was 0.01% bromphenol blue, 0.01% methyl red, and 10% glycerol. Electrophoresis conditions were 1 h at 100 V, 1 h at 200 V, and 0.5 h at 500 V. Proteins with more than one pI value, based on two or more bands in the IEF gel, were assigned a single pI value equal to the average of all determined pI values. The hydrodynamic properties of BglI were analyzed by analytical ultracentrifugation using sedimentation velocity. BglI was diluted to an A280 of 0.5 in 100 mm sodium chloride, 30 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.0. The experiments were performed in a Beckman Coulter XL-A analytical ultracentrifuge at 45,000 r.p.m. and 21 °C. The biophysical properties were determined by using Ultrascan III software with two-dimensional spectrum analysis and a genetic algorithm (41Demeler B. Scott D.J. Harding S.E. Rowe A.J.

https://openalex.org/W1972705715,"The water flea Daphnia magna has been used as an animal model in ecology, evolution, and environmental sciences. Thanks to the recent progress in Daphnia genomics, genetic information such as the draft genome sequence and expressed sequence tags (ESTs) is now available. To investigate the relationship between phenotypes and the available genetic information about Daphnia, some gene manipulation methods have been developed. However, a technique to induce targeted mutagenesis into Daphnia genome remains elusive. To overcome this problem, we focused on an emerging genome editing technique mediated by the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/CRISPR-associated (CRISPR/Cas) system to introduce genomic mutations. In this study, we targeted a functionally conserved regulator of eye development, the eyeless gene in D. magna. When we injected Cas9 mRNAs and eyeless-targeting guide RNAs into eggs, 18-47% of the survived juveniles exhibited abnormal eye morphology. After maturation, up to 8.2% of the adults produced progenies with deformed eyes, which carried mutations in the eyeless loci. These results showed that CRISPR/Cas system could introduce heritable mutations into the endogenous eyeless gene in D. magna. This is the first report of a targeted gene knockout technique in Daphnia and will be useful in uncovering Daphnia gene functions."

Ecosystems are complicated networks, with one species relying on another, and managing one species in isolation may damage other members of a community. Lampert et al. (see the Perspective by Buckley and Han) looked at the conflict between eradicating a damaging invasive grass species and protecting an endangered bird species that uses the grass as its home. The most effective management and restoration approach focused not on eradicating the invasive grass as quickly as possible but on making changes slowly enough that the birds could adapt. This approach may prove useful in other situations in which active restoration conflicts with other conservation goals. Science , this issue p. 1028 ; see also p. 975"
https://openalex.org/W2108848054,"Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) play major roles in the regulation of hepatic lipid metabolism through the control of numerous genes involved in processes such as lipid uptake and fatty acid oxidation. Here we identify hypoxia-inducible lipid droplet-associated (Hilpda/Hig2) as a novel PPAR target gene and demonstrate its involvement in hepatic lipid metabolism. Microarray analysis revealed that Hilpda is one of the most highly induced genes by the PPARα agonist Wy14643 in mouse precision cut liver slices. Induction of Hilpda mRNA by Wy14643 was confirmed in mouse and human hepatocytes. Oral dosing with Wy14643 similarly induced Hilpda mRNA levels in livers of wild-type mice but not Ppara−/− mice. Transactivation studies and chromatin immunoprecipitation showed that Hilpda is a direct PPARα target gene via a conserved PPAR response element located 1200 base pairs upstream of the transcription start site. Hepatic overexpression of HILPDA in mice via adeno-associated virus led to a 4-fold increase in liver triglyceride storage, without any changes in key genes involved in de novo lipogenesis, β-oxidation, or lipolysis. Moreover, intracellular lipase activity was not affected by HILPDA overexpression. Strikingly, HILPDA overexpression significantly impaired hepatic triglyceride secretion.

The liver is a key organ in the control of lipid metabolism. During the postprandial phase, the liver is responsible for uptake and processing of chylomicron remnants and actively synthesizes cholesterol, bile acids, and fatty acids. In the fasted state, the liver serves as a sink for adipose tissue-derived plasma free fatty acids, which are fully oxidized or converted into ketone bodies. In addition, incoming fatty acids are esterified into triglycerides and stored within lipid droplets or secreted as VLDL (1McPherson P.A. McEneny J.

Lazar M.A. Dissociating fatty liver and diabetes.Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2013; 24: 4-12Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Disturbances in these metabolic pathways can impair liver function and predispose to non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Many genes involved in the above-mentioned processes are regulated by nuclear receptors (3Pawlak M. Lefebvre P. Staels B. General molecular biology and architecture of nuclear receptors.Curr. Top. Med. Chem. 2012; 12: 486-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 4Nakamura M.T. Cheon Y. Li Y. Nara T.Y. Mechanisms of regulation of gene expression by fatty acids.Lipids. 2004; 39: 1077-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Nuclear receptors comprise a family of transcription factors that bind to specific response elements across the genome and regulate the expression of a large network of genes (5Chawla A. Repa J.J. Evans R.M. Mangelsdorf D.J. Nuclear receptors and lipid physiology: opening the X-files.Science. 2001; 294: 1866-1870Crossref PubMed Scopus (1691) Google Scholar). As a group, they are activated by a variety of steroid hormones and other lipid-derived compounds, including fat-soluble vitamins, cholesterol, and fatty acids (6Sonoda J. Pei L. Evans R.M. Nuclear receptors: decoding metabolic disease.FEBS Lett. 2008; 582: 2-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). A group of nuclear receptors that has been extensively studied and that plays a central role in the regulation of nutrient homeostasis in liver and other organs are the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) 2The abbreviations used are: PPARperoxisome proliferator-activated receptorHILPDAhypoxia-inducible lipid droplet-associatedPPREPPAR response elementAAVadeno-associated virusTGtriglycerideqPCRquantitative PCRTSStranscription start site. (7Kersten S. Desvergne B. Wahli W. Roles of PPARs in health and disease.Nature. 2000; 405: 421-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (1665) Google Scholar). PPARs are ligand-activated transcription factors that bind a variety of (dietary) fatty acids and fatty acid-derived compounds, including various eicosanoids (8Schupp M. Lazar M.A. Endogenous ligands for nuclear receptors: digging deeper.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 40409-40415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Furthermore, PPARs are the molecular target of the thiazolidinedione and fibrate classes of drugs used in the treatment of diabetes and dyslipidemia, respectively (9Lalloyer F. Staels B. Fibrates, glitazones, and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors.Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2010; 30: 894-899Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Three different PPARs can be distinguished: PPARα (Nr1c1), PPARβ/δ (Nr1c2), and PPARγ (Nr1c3) (10Dreyer C. Krey G. Keller H. Givel F. Helftenbein G. Wahli W.

PPARγ is highly expressed in adipose tissue, where it regulates genes involved in fat cell development, lipid deposition, insulin signaling, and inflammation (12Tontonoz P. Spiegelman B.M. Fat and beyond: the diverse biology of PPARγ.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2008; 77: 289-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (1563) Google Scholar). PPARβ/δ is found at high levels in many tissues, and compelling evidence indicates that it stimulates fatty acid oxidation, at least in skeletal muscle and adipose tissue (13Kleiner S. Nguyen-Tran V. Baré O. Huang X. Spiegelman B. Wu Z. PPARδ agonism activates fatty acid oxidation via PGC-1α but does not increase mitochondrial gene expression and function.J. Biol.

Expression of PPARα is highest in tissues that oxidize fatty acids at a rapid rate, including liver, brown adipose tissue, heart, and kidney (15Mandard S. Müller M. Kersten S. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α target genes.Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2004; 61: 393-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar). Activation of PPARα leads to induction of a large set of target genes involved in various pathways of lipid metabolism, including fatty acid transport, activation, storage, and oxidation (16Peters J.M. Hennuyer N. Staels B. Fruchart J.C. Fievet C. Gonzalez F.J. Auwerx J. Alterations in lipoprotein metabolism in peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α-deficient mice.J. Biol.

As a consequence, mice lacking PPARα suffer from hepatic steatosis, hypoglycemia, hypoketonemia, and elevated plasma free fatty acids, all of which are aggravated during fasting (18Kersten S.

AAVs were made by Vector Biolabs (Philadelphia, PA). In short, mouse Hilpda cDNA was inserted in pAAV-ALBp-3′iALB, a vector containing a modified albumin promoter flanked by two AAV2-derived inverted terminal repeats. To produce viruses, the above construct was packaged into AAV8 capsid in HEK293 cells by transfecting pAAV-ALBp-3′iALB, AAV2/AAV8 rep/cap vector, and Ad helper vector. Viral particles were purified by two sequential CsCl2 gradients and titrated by qPCR to determine viral genomes. The same amount of AAV2/AAV8 hybrid virus expressing GFP was injected to serve as a control. Male wild-type Sv129 and Ppara−/− mice on an Sv129 background were obtained from the Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). Five-month-old wild-type and Ppara−/− mice were fed a diet containing Wy14643 at a concentration of 0.1% for 5 days, after which the livers were excised and snap-frozen. Five-month-old wild-type and Ppara−/− mice were fasted for 24 h, and their livers were collected for analysis of Hilpda mRNA and protein levels. Male 8-week-old C57BL/6J mice were purchased from Charles River Laboratories (Sulzfeld, Germany) and maintained on a 12-h light-dark cycle with ad libitum access to chow and water. Adeno-associated viruses were administrated in a volume of 100 μl via the tail vein. Ten animals were injected with different amounts of AAV ranging from 1 × 1011 to 5 × 1011 genomic copies to determine the dose required for a significant increase in hepatic HILPDA expression. Subsequent experiments were performed after injection of 2.5 × 1011 genomic copies. Body composition analysis of AAV-GFP and AAV-HILPDA animals 4 weeks postinjection was performed using EchoMRI (Echo Medical Systems, Houston, TX). Male wild-type C57BL/6 animals (9–12 weeks old) were fed a low fat or high fat diet containing 10 or 45 energy percent fat, respectively (D12450B/D12451, Research Diets Services, Wijk bij Duurstede, The Netherlands). After 16 weeks, the livers were analyzed for triglyceride content and HILPDA expression. All animal experiments were approved by the local animal welfare committees of Wageningen University or the German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ, Heidelberg, Germany), respectively. AAV-GFP and AAV-HILPDA animals were fasted for 16 h and subsequently anesthetized via intraperitoneal injection of a mixture of Dormicum (midazolam, Roche Applied Science) and Hypnorm (fentanyl/fluanisone, VetaPharma, Leeds, UK) prepared in saline at 7 and 14/0.5 mg/kg, respectively. Then a blood sample was drawn, and the animals were injected intravenously with 500 mg/kg body weight tyloxapol (Sigma-Aldrich) diluted in saline to a 10% (w/v) solution. Every 30 min thereafter, blood was collected via the tail vein over the course of 2 h. Serum samples were assayed for triglycerides using a Triglycerides liquicolormono kit (HUMAN, Wiesbaden, Germany). Ppara−/− mice were injected with adenovirus encoding LacZ or Pparγ1 via the tail vein and sacrificed 6 days later (19Yu S. Matsusue K. Kashireddy P. Cao W.Q. Yeldandi V. Yeldandi A.V. Rao M.S.

Livers from C57BL/6 mice were briefly perfused with saline, excised, and submerged in ice-cold Krebs-Henseleit buffer supplemented with 11 mm glucose, 25 mm sodium bicarbonate, 10 mm HEPES, and penicillin/streptomycin. Next, 5 mm cylindrical liver cores were prepared with a surgical biopsy punch and sectioned to 200 μm slices using a Krumedieck tissue slicer (Alabama Research and Development, Munford, AL) filled with carbonated Krebs-Henseleit buffer. Liver slices were incubated in William's E Medium (Lonza, Verviers, Belgium) in 6-well plates at 37 °C/5% CO2 under continuous agitation. After 1 h, the media were replaced with fresh William's E Medium containing 0.1% DMSO or 20 μm Wy14643, and the slices were incubated for 6 or 24 h. Rat (Wistar) and mouse (Sv129) hepatocytes were isolated by two-step collagenase perfusion. Cells were plated on collagen-coated 6-well plates. Viability was determined by trypan blue exclusion and was at least 75%. Hepatocytes were suspended in William's E medium (Lonza Bioscience, Verviers, Belgium) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum, 20 milliunits/ml insulin, 50 nm dexamethasone, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 0.25 μg/ml fungizone, and 50 μg/ml gentamycin. The next day, cells were incubated in fresh medium in the presence or absence of Wy14643 dissolved in DMSO for 24 h, followed by RNA isolation. Rat hepatoma FAO cells were grown in DMEM containing 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Cells were harvested at different time points after the addition of Wy14643 (5 μm) or DMSO. A fragment of 645 and 519 bp containing the PPRE localized 1200 bp upstream of the transcription start site (TSS) was amplified from human and mouse genomic DNA, respectively, using the following primers: human Fwd1, 5′-GCCTTCACCTGGCAAAGTAG-3′; human Rev1, 5′-AAGAGCCAGGAGGTCACAGA-3′; mouse Fwd1, 5′-GGATGACTCCCAGAAGTGGA-3′; mouse Rev1, 5′-GACCTGCCTTACCAGTCACC-3′. The resulting fragments were gel-purified using a QIAquick gel extraction kit (Qiagen, Venlo, The Netherlands) and employed in a second PCR to introduce KpnI and BglII restriction sites to the resulting 278- and 219-bp fragments containing the human and mouse PPRE, respectively. Primers used for this PCR were as follows: human Fwd2, 5′-aaggtaccAGTTGGCTCCAAATGTCTGC-3′; human Rev2, 5′-cgaaagatctTGGTGGCTTTAGAACTGGCG-3′; mouse Fwd2, 5′-aaggtaccATTTCCACCTCCTGTGCTTG-3′; mouse Rev2, 5′-cgacagatctTGCGTTCTCATGACTTCCAG-3′. To introduce mutations in both the human and mouse PPRE, an overlap PCR strategy was carried out. First, to generate partially overlapping fragments, the human Fwd2 primer was used together with reverse primer 5′-TCCCCACTGCGACCGGGCCCCTCCTTTCCT-3′, and human Rev2 primer was used with forward primer 5′-AGGAAAGGAGGGGCCCGGTCGCAGTGGGGA-3′, using a wild-type insert as template. The resulting fragments were gel-purified and used in a second PCR with human Fwd2 and Rev2 primers. For mice, the Fwd2 primer was combined with reverse primer 5′-CTTCCGCTGTGACCGGGCCCCTACTTTTCA-3′, and Rev2 primer was combined with forward primer 5′-TGAAAAGTAGGGGCCCGGTCACAGCGGAAG-3′. For the final PCR, purified fragments were combined in a PCR to generate a mutant insert using mouse Fwd2 and Rev2 primers. Resulting fragments were cloned in the KpnI and BglII sites of the pGL3-Promoter vector (Promega, Leiden, The Netherlands). The presence of the correct insert was confirmed with sequencing (EZ-Seq, Macrogen, Amsterdam, The Netherlands) using RV3primer (5′-CTAGCAAAATAGGCTGTCCC-3′) (Promega). Reporter vectors were transfected into the human hepatocellular cell line HepG2 (ATCC, Manassas, VA) in the presence or absence of pSG5 vector expressing PPARα, PPARβ/δ, PPARγ, or pSG5 empty vector. pSG5 expression vector encoding RXR was co-transfected with PPAR expression vectors. A β-galactosidase expression vector was co-transfected in all cases for determination of transfection efficiency. All transfections were performed using polyethyleneimine (PEI). Sixteen hours post-transfection, the cells were incubated with Wy14643 (50 μm), GW510516 (5 μm), rosiglitazone (5 μm), or DMSO, respectively. Reporter activity was measured 24 h after adding the corresponding ligands using the Promega luciferase assay kit (Promega) on a Fluoroskan Ascent apparatus (Thermo Scientific). β-Galactosidase activity in cell lysates was determined using 2-nitrophenyl β-d-galactopyranoside as a substrate, and absorbance values were used to normalize the luciferase measurements. Data presented are based on three individual experiments. Primary hepatocytes were isolated from 10–12-week-old wild-type or Ppara−/− animals on a C57BL/6 background according to published methods (20Rakhshandehroo M. Hooiveld G. Müller M. Kersten S. Comparative analysis of gene regulation by the transcription factor PPARα between mouse and human.PLoS One. 2009; 4: e6796Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Hepatocytes were plated on 15-cm dishes coated with rat tail collagen at a density of 1 × 105 cells/cm2. To cross-link proteins to DNA, the cells were incubated with 1% formaldehyde for 10 min, after which glycine was added to a final concentration of 0.125 m to stop the cross-linking reaction. Cells were collected in ice-cold PBS, washed twice, and snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Cell pellets were lysed in 500 μl of lysis buffer containing 0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 0.15 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris, pH 8, and protease inhibitor mixture (Pierce). Following 30 cycles of sonication (30 s on, 30 s off, high intensity) at 4 °C, the samples were centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 30 min. Next, 100 μl of the supernatant was diluted 4 times with incubation buffer (0.15% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 0.15 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 20 mm HEPES) and subsequently mixed with antibodies (anti-PPARα (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., catalog no. H-98) or IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, catalog no. sc2027)) for 2 h at 4 °C on a rotating wheel. To reduce nonspecific binding, Protein A-Sepharose beads (GE Healthcare) were washed twice and preincubated with incubation buffer supplemented with 1 μg/μl BSA for 2 h at 4 °C on a rotating wheel. Then blocked Protein A-Sepharose mixture was combined with chromatin/antibody mixtures and incubated overnight at 4 °C on a rotating wheel. The beads were subsequently washed in a series of buffers: twice in buffer 1 (0.1% SDS, 0.1% NaDOC, 1% Triton X-100, 0.15 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 20 mm HEPES), once in buffer 2 (0.1% SDS, 0.1% NaDOC, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 20 mm HEPES), once in buffer 3 (0.25 m LiCl, 0.5% NaDOC, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, 20 mm HEPES), and twice in buffer 4 (1 mm EDTA, 20 mm HEPES). Protein-DNA complexes were eluted in 200 μl of elution buffer (1% SDS + 0.1 m NaHCO3). To disrupt the cross-links between protein-DNA, eluted samples were supplemented with 8 μl of 5 m NaCl, 8 μl of RNase A (0.5 mg/ml), and 10 μl of Proteinase K (20 mg/ml; Qiagen) and incubated overnight at 65 °C. DNA was purified using a QiAQuick PCR purification kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's protocol and analyzed by real-time PCR using primers directed against a 125-bp fragment encompassing the PPRE located 1200 base pairs upstream of the TSS of Hilpda. Sequences of the primers that were used were as follows: Hilpda Fwd, 5′-GCACGTCTCTCTTCTTCTAGGT-3′; Hilpda Rev, 5′-TCGCCTCTAAACTAAACGGAA-3′. Primers against an intergenic region 100 kb upstream of Pdk4 served as control: Fwd, 5′-TTGGCTTGCCAAGCTTCTTC-3′; Rev, 5′-AGGGAACGCATTTCCATCAC-3′. Non-esterified fatty acids were measured using a NEFA-HR(2) kit, and ketone bodies were measured using an Autokit Total Ketone Bodies assay (Wako Chemicals GmbH, Neuss, Germany). Triglycerides were determined with a Triglycerides liquicolormono kit (HUMAN). Glucose, glycerol, and cholesterol were measured using kits from DiaSys (DiaSys Diagnostic Systems, Holzheim, Germany). Pooled plasma samples from AAV-GFP and AAV-HILPDA animals were fractionated using gel filtration high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) offered by LipoSEARCH (Skylight Biotech, Inc., Akita, Japan). Effluent was subsequently analyzed for triglycerides and cholesterol content. For GFP fluorescence microscopy, samples were fixed in 4% formaldehyde (Sigma-Aldrich) overnight, soaked in PBS containing 15% (w/v) sucrose for 12 h, and then incubated in PBS containing 30% (w/v) sucrose overnight. Tissues were subsequently frozen in Tissue-Tek® O.C.T.TM (Sakura Finetek Holland B.V., Alphen aan de Rijn, The Netherlands) and sectioned to 5 μm and mounted on Superfrost microscopy slides. GFP fluorescence was determined using an Olympus CKX31 fluorescent microscope (Olympus Nederland B.V, Zoeterwoude, The Netherlands). For hematoxylin and eosin staining, liver pieces were fixed in 4% formaldehyde for 24 h and subsequently embedded in paraffin. Samples were sectioned to 5 μm and stained in hematoxylin for 8 min and eosin for 30 s. Following dehydration in 95% ethanol and two xylene changes, the sections were mounted using a xylene-based mounting medium. To visualize neutral lipids, liver samples were frozen in Tissue-Tek® O.C.T.TM, sectioned to 5 μm using a cryostat, and mounted on Superfrost microscopy slides. After drying at room temperature for 30 min, the tissue sections were fixed in 4% formaldehyde (Sigma-Aldrich) for 10 min. Following three washes with double-distilled H2O, the slides were incubated in Oil Red O (Sigma-Aldrich) solution (30 mg/ml in 60% isopropyl alcohol) for 10 min. Finally, the slides were rinsed with double-distilled H2O twice and mounted using an aqueous mounting medium. Liver pieces of ∼50 mg were homogenized to a 5% lysate (m/v) using 10 mm Tris, 2 mm EDTA, 0.25 m sucrose, pH 7.5. Lysates were assayed for triglyceride (TGs) using a Triglycerides liquicolormono kit (HUMAN). TG levels were normalized against liver weight. Tissues (∼50 mg) were homogenized in 0.5 ml of 30% KOH, incubated at 95 °C for 30 min, and centrifuged at 15,000 × g to pellet undigested material. Glycogen was precipitated from the supernatants by the addition of 0.75 ml of 95% ethanol and subsequent centrifugation at 3000 × g for 20 min. Glycogen pellets were washed with fresh 95% ethanol, centrifuged, and air-dried. Pellets were dissolved in 0.25 ml of double-distilled H2O and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. To digest the glycogen, 5 mg of amyloglucosidase (catalog no. A7420, Sigma-Aldrich) was dissolved in 15 ml of 0.2 m sodium acetate, pH 4.8, and 450 μl of the resulting enzyme solution was mixed with 50 μl of glycogen solution. After incubation at 40 °C for 2 h, the samples were neutralized using 10 μl of 30% KOH. Glucose concentrations were determined with a kit from DiaSys, and protein concentrations were measured with a Pierce BCA kit (Thermo Scientific, Landsmeer, The Netherlands). Liver samples were homogenized in 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 0.5% (v/v) sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, supplemented with Complete EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture with a Qiagen TissueLyser II. Samples were incubated on a rotating wheel for 30 min at 4 °C and subsequently centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. Protein concentration was determined using a Pierce BCA kit (Thermo Scientific), and equal amounts of protein were diluted with 2× Laemmli sample buffer. After boiling, the samples were separated on 4–20 or 8–16% gradient Criterion gels. For plasma analysis, 1 μl of plasma from AAV-GFP or AAV-HILPDA animals was loaded on an 8–16% Criterion gel. Proteins were transferred to PVDF membrane using the Transblot turbo system (Bio-Rad). Antibodies against HILPDA (1:1000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, catalog no. sc-137518), actin (1:2000; Sigma-Aldrich, catalog no. A2066), HSP90 (1:4000; Cell Signaling Technology, Inc., catalog no. 4874), and goat anti-rabbit (1:5000; Jackson ImmunoResearch, catalog no. 111-035-003) were diluted in 5% (w/v) skimmed milk powder in PBS-T. Primary antibodies were applied overnight at 4 °C, and secondary antibody was applied for 1 h at room temperature. Bands were visualized using Pierce ECL Plus (Thermo Scientific) and a ChemiDoc MP (Bio-Rad). The presence of plasma proteins on the PVDF membrane was confirmed using Ponceau S solution (Sigma-Aldrich). Mouse liver slices and tissues were homogenized in TRIzol® (Invitrogen) using the Qiagen TissueLyser II and stainless steel beads. One microgram of RNA was subsequently employed for cDNA synthesis using the First Strand cDNA synthesis kit (Thermo Scientific). RNA from a selection of slices and tissues was purified with RNeasy Minikit columns (Qiagen) and analyzed for quality with RNA 6000 Nano chips on the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Amsterdam, The Netherlands). Purified RNA (100 ng) was labeled with the Ambion WT expression kit (Invitrogen) and hybridized to an Affymetrix Mouse Gene 1.1 ST array plate (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA). Hybridization, washing, and scanning were carried out on an Affymetrix GeneTitan platform, and readouts were processed and analyzed according to published methods (21Lichtenstein L.

After filtering with interquartile range of 0.25 and expression signal of 20 on a minimum of two arrays, 1575 genes remained, which were used to generate a scatter plot and volcano plot. Microarray data were submitted to the Gene Expression Omnibus (accession number pending). qPCRs were performed using SensiMix (Bioline, GC Biotech, Alphen aan den Rijn, The Netherlands) and a CFX384 real-time PCR detection system (Bio-Rad). Primer sequences were derived from the Harvard PrimerBank and synthesized by Eurogentec (Seraing, Belgium). Primer sequences are listed in Table 1. Normalization was performed using the expression of 36b4. qPCR analysis of mouse and human hepatocytes exposed to DMSO or Wy14643 for 6 h was performed as described above using RNA from hepatocytes of six different mouse strains and six human hepatocyte sample sets as described (20Rakhshandehroo M.

https://openalex.org/W1996191723,"Most cancer patients die with metastatic disease, thus, good models that recapitulate the natural process of metastasis including a dormancy period with micrometastatic cells would be beneficial in developing treatment strategies. Herein we report a model of natural metastasis that balances time to complete experiments with a reasonable dormancy period, which can be used to better study metastatic progression. The basis for the model is a 4T1 triple negative syngeneic breast cancer model without resection of the primary tumor. A cell titration from 500 to 15,000 GFP tagged 4T1 cells implanted into fat pad number four of immune proficient eight week female BALB/cJ mice optimized speed of the model while possessing metastatic processes including dormancy and beginning of reactivation. The frequency of primary tumors was less than 50% in animals implanted with 500-1500 cells. Although implantation with over 10,000 cells resulted in 100% primary tumor development, the tumors and macrometastases formed were highly aggressive, lacked dormancy, and offered no opportunity for treatment. Implantation of 7,500 cells resulted in >90% tumor take by 10 days; in 30-60 micrometastases in the lung (with many animals also having 2-30 brain micrometastases) two weeks post-implantation, with the first small macrometastases present at five weeks; many animals displaying macrometastases at five weeks and animals becoming moribund by six weeks post-implantation. Using the optimum of 7,500 cells the efficacy of a chemotherapeutic agent for breast cancer, doxorubicin, given at its maximal tolerated dose (MTD; 1 mg/kg weekly) was tested for an effect on metastasis. Doxorubicin treatment significantly reduced primary tumor growth and lung micrometastases but the number of macrometastases at experiment end was not significantly affected. This model should prove useful for development of drugs to target metastasis and to study the biology of metastasis."
https://openalex.org/W2056150471,"In our previous studies we have described that ST3Gal III transfected pancreatic adenocarcinoma Capan-1 and MDAPanc-28 cells show increased membrane expression levels of sialyl-Lewis x (SLe(x)) along with a concomitant decrease in α2,6-sialic acid compared to control cells. Here we have addressed the role of this glycosylation pattern in the functional properties of two glycoproteins involved in the processes of cancer cell invasion and migration, α2β1 integrin, the main receptor for type 1 collagen, and E-cadherin, responsible for cell-cell contacts and whose deregulation determines cell invasive capabilities. Our results demonstrate that ST3Gal III transfectants showed reduced cell-cell aggregation and increased invasive capacities. ST3Gal III transfected Capan-1 cells exhibited higher SLe(x) and lower α2,6-sialic acid content on the glycans of their α2β1 integrin molecules. As a consequence, higher phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase tyrosine 397, which is recognized as one of the first steps of integrin-derived signaling pathways, was observed in these cells upon adhesion to type 1 collagen. This molecular mechanism underlies the increased migration through collagen of these cells. In addition, the pancreatic adenocarcinoma cell lines as well as human pancreatic tumor tissues showed colocalization of SLe(x) and E-cadherin, which was higher in the ST3Gal III transfectants. In conclusion, changes in the sialylation pattern of α2β1 integrin and E-cadherin appear to influence the functional role of these two glycoproteins supporting the role of these glycans as an underlying mechanism regulating pancreatic cancer cell adhesion and invasion."
https://openalex.org/W2096385714,"Studies of the African Middle Stone Age (MSA) have become central for defining the cultural adaptations that accompanied the evolution of modern humans. While much of recent research in South Africa has focused on the Still Bay and Howiesons Poort (HP), periods following these technocomplexes were often neglected. Here we examine lithic assemblages from Sibudu that post-date the HP to further the understanding of MSA cultural variability during the Late Pleistocene. Sibudu preserves an exceptionally thick, rich, and high-resolution archaeological sequence that dates to ∼ 58 ka, which has recently been proposed as type assemblage for the ""Sibudan"". This study presents a detailed analysis of the six uppermost lithic assemblages from these deposits (BM-BSP) that we excavated from 2011-2013. We define the key elements of the lithic technology and compare our findings to other assemblages post-dating the HP. The six lithic assemblages provide a distinct and robust cultural signal, closely resembling each other in various technological, techno-functional, techno-economic, and typological characteristics. These results refute assertions that modern humans living after the HP possessed an unstructured and unsophisticated MSA lithic technology. While we observed several parallels with other contemporaneous MSA sites, particularly in the eastern part of southern Africa, the lithic assemblages at Sibudu demonstrate a distinct and so far unique combination of techno-typological traits. Our findings support the use of the Sibudan to help structuring this part of the southern African MSA and emphasize the need for further research to identify the spatial and temporal extent of this proposed cultural unit."
https://openalex.org/W2036673768,"Hypoxia is a common feature in children with sickle cell disease (SCD) that is inconsistently associated with painful crises and acute chest syndrome. To assess the prevalence and risk factors of hypoxia, we recorded daytime, nocturnal, and postexercise pulse oximetry (SpO2) values in 39 SCD patients with a median age of 10.8 years. Median daytime SpO2 was 97% (range, 89%-100%), and 36% of patients had daytime hypoxia defined as SpO2<96%. Median nocturnal SpO2 was 94.7% (range, 87.7%-99.5%), 50% of patients had nocturnal hypoxia defined as SpO2≤93%, and 11(37%) patients spent more than 10% of their total sleep time with SpO2<90%. Median postexercise SpO2 was 94% (range, 72%-100%) and 44.7% of patients had postexercise hypoxia defined as an SpO2 decrease ≥3% after a 6-minute walk test. Among patients with normal daytime SpO2, 35% had nocturnal and 42% postexercise hypoxia. Compared to 9 patients without daytime, nocturnal, or postexercise hypoxia, 25 patients with hypoxia under at least one of these three conditions had greater anemia severity (P = 0.01), lower HbF levels (P = 0.04), and higher aspartate aminotransferase levels (P = 0.03). Males predominated among patients with postexercise hypoxia (P = 0.004). Hypoxia correlated neither with painful crises nor with acute chest syndrome. Of 32 evaluable patients, 6 (18.8%) had a tricuspid regurgitation velocity ≥2.6 m/s, and this feature was associated with anemia (P = 0.044). Median percentage of the predicted distance covered during a 6-minute walk test was 86% [46-120]; the distance was negatively associated with LDH (P = 0.044) and with a past history of acute chest syndrome (P = 0.009). In conclusion, severe episodes of nocturnal and postexercise hypoxia are common in children with SCD, even those with normal daytime SpO2."
https://openalex.org/W2123352057,"Yeast Pah1p is the phosphatidate phosphatase that catalyzes the penultimate step in triacylglycerol synthesis and plays a role in the transcriptional regulation of phospholipid synthesis genes. The enzyme is multiply phosphorylated, some of which is mediated by Pho85p-Pho80p, Cdc28p-cyclin B, and protein kinase A. Here, we showed that Pah1p is a bona fide substrate of protein kinase C; the phosphorylation reaction was time- and dose-dependent and dependent on the concentrations of ATP (Km = 4.5 μm) and Pah1p (Km = 0.75 μm). The stoichiometry of the reaction was 0.8 mol of phosphate/mol of Pah1p. By combining mass spectrometry, truncation analysis, site-directed mutagenesis, and phosphopeptide mapping, we identified Ser-677, Ser-769, Ser-773, and Ser-788 as major sites of phosphorylation. Analysis of Pah1p phosphorylations by different protein kinases showed that prephosphorylation with protein kinase C reduces its subsequent phosphorylation with protein kinase A and vice versa. Prephosphorylation with Pho85p-Pho80p had an inhibitory effect on its subsequent phosphorylation with protein kinase C; however, prephosphorylation with protein kinase C had no effect on the subsequent phosphorylation with Pho85p-Pho80p. Unlike its phosphorylations by Pho85p-Pho80p and protein kinase A, which cause a significant reduction in phosphatidate phosphatase activity, the phosphorylation of Pah1p by protein kinase C had a small stimulatory effect on the enzyme activity. Analysis of phosphorylation-deficient forms of Pah1p indicated that protein kinase C does not have a major effect on its location or its function in triacylglycerol synthesis, but instead, the phosphorylation favors loss of Pah1p abundance when it is not phosphorylated with Pho85p-Pho80p.

https://openalex.org/W2028697087,"Aluminium (Al) is the third most abundant element in the earth’s crust and its compounds are used in the form of house hold utensils, medicines and in antiperspirant etc. Increasing number of evidences suggest the involvement of Al+3 ions in a variety of neurodegenerative disorders including Alzheimer’s disease. Here, we have attempted to investigate the role of Al in endoplasmic reticulum stress and the regulation of p53 during neuronal apoptosis using neuroblastoma cell line. We observed that Al caused oxidative stress by increasing ROS production and intracellular calcium levels together with depletion of intracellular GSH levels. We also studied modulation of key pro- and anti-apoptotic proteins and found significant alterations in the levels of Nrf2, NQO1, pAKT, p21, Bax, Bcl2, Aβ1-40 and Cyt c together with increase in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress related proteins like CHOP and caspase 12. However, with respect to the role of p53, we observed downregulation of its transcript as well as protein levels while analysis of its ubiquitination status revealed no significant changes. Not only did Al increase the activities of caspase 9, caspase 12 and caspase 3, but, by the use of peptide inhibitors of specific and pan-caspases, we observed significant protection against neuronal cell death upon inhibition of caspase 12, demonstrating the prominent role of endoplasmic reticulum stress generated responses in Al toxicity. Overall our findings suggest that Al induces ER stress and ROS generation which compromises the antioxidant defenses of neuronal cells thereby promoting neuronal apoptosis in p53 independent pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2054517043,"Introduction Observational studies using case-control designs have showed an increased risk of pneumonia associated with inhaled corticosteroid (ICS)-containing medications in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). New-user observational cohort designs may minimize biases associated with previous case-control designs. Objective To estimate the association between ICS and pneumonia among new users of ICS relative to inhaled long-acting bronchodilator (LABD) monotherapy. Methods Pneumonia events in COPD patients ≥45 years old were compared among new users of ICS medications (n = 11,555; ICS, ICS/long-acting β2-agonist [LABA] combination) and inhaled LABD monotherapies (n = 6,492; LABA, long-acting muscarinic antagonists) using Cox proportional hazards models, with propensity scores to adjust for confounding. Setting: United Kingdom electronic medical records with linked hospitalization and mortality data (2002–2010). New users were censored at earliest of: pneumonia event, death, changing/discontinuing treatment, or end of follow-up. Outcomes: severe pneumonia (primary) and any pneumonia (secondary). Results Following adjustment, new use of ICS-containing medications was associated with an increased risk of pneumonia hospitalization (n = 322 events; HR = 1.55, 95% CI: 1.14, 2.10) and any pneumonia (n = 702 events; HR = 1.49, 95% CI: 1.22, 1.83). Crude incidence rates of any pneumonia were 48.7 and 30.9 per 1000 person years among the ICS-containing and LABD cohorts, respectively. Excess risk of pneumonia with ICS was reduced when requiring ≥1 month or ≥ 6 months of new use. There was an apparent dose-related effect, with greater risk at higher daily doses of ICS. There was evidence of channeling bias, with more severe patients prescribed ICS, for which the analysis may not have completely adjusted. Conclusions The results of this new-user cohort study are consistent with published findings; ICS were associated with a 20–50% increased risk of pneumonia in COPD, which reduced with exposure time. This risk must be weighed against the benefits when prescribing ICS to patients with COPD."

https://openalex.org/W2052557035,"The fall webworm, Hyphantria cunea (Drury), enters facultative diapause as a pupa in response to short-day conditions during autumn. Photoperiodic response curves showed that the critical day length for diapause induction was 14 h 30 min, 14 h 25 min and 13 h 30 min at 22, 25 and 28°C, respectively. The photoperiodic responses under non-24 h light-dark cycles demonstrated that night length played an essential role in the determination of diapause. Experiments using a short day length interrupted by a 1-h light pulse exhibited two troughs of diapause inhibition and the effect of diapause inhibition was greater in the early scotophase than in the late scotophase. The diapause-inducing short day lengths of 8, 10 and 12 h evoked greater intensities of diapause than did 13 and 14 h. Diapause can be terminated without exposure to chilling, but chilling at 5°C for 90 and 120 d significantly accelerated diapause development, reduced mortality, and synchronized adult emergence. Additionally, the potential for H. cunea from the temperate region (Qingdao) to emerge and overwinter under field conditions in subtropical regions (Nanchang) of China was evaluated. Pupae that were transferred to Nanchang in early July showed a 60% survival rate and extremely dispersed pupal period (from 12 to 82 days), suggesting that some pupae may undergo summer diapause. Diapausing temperate region pupae that were moved out-of-doors in Nanchang during October showed approximately 20% overwintering survival; moreover, those pupae that overwintered successfully emerged the next spring during a period when their host plants would be available. The results indicate that this moth has the potential to expand its range into subtropical regions of China."

Thus IgG4 does not activate complement and shows conformational variability. These properties are attributable to its hinge region, which is the shortest of the four IgG subclasses. Using high throughput scattering methods, we studied the solution structure of wild-type IgG4(Ser222) and a hinge mutant IgG4(Pro222) in different buffers and temperatures where the proline substitution suppresses the formation of half-antibody. Analytical ultracentrifugation showed that both IgG4 forms were principally monomeric with sedimentation coefficients s20,w0 of 6.6–6.8 S. A monomer-dimer equilibrium was observed in heavy water buffer at low temperature. Scattering showed that the x-ray radius of gyration Rg was unchanged with concentration in 50–250 mm NaCl buffers, whereas the neutron Rg values showed a concentration-dependent increase as the temperature decreased in heavy water buffers. The distance distribution curves (P(r)) revealed two peaks, M1 and M2, that shifted below 2 mg/ml to indicate concentration-dependent IgG4 structures in addition to IgG4 dimer formation at high concentration in heavy water. Constrained x-ray and neutron scattering modeling revealed asymmetric solution structures for IgG4(Ser222) with extended hinge structures. The IgG4(Pro222) structure was similar. Both IgG4 structures showed that their Fab regions were positioned close enough to the Fc region to restrict C1q binding.

https://openalex.org/W2070266512,"Scedosporium apiospermum is an emerging fungal pathogen that causes both localized and disseminated infections in immunocompromised patients. Glucosylceramides (CMH, GlcCer) are the main neutral glycosphingolipids expressed in fungal cells. In this study, glucosylceramides (GlcCer) were extracted and purified in several chromatographic steps. Using high-performance thin layer chromatography (HPTLC) and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS), N-2′-hydroxyhexadecanoyl-1-β-D-glucopyranosyl-9-methyl-4,8-sphingadienine was identified as the main GlcCer in S. apiospermum. A monoclonal antibody (Mab) against this molecule was used for indirect immunofluorescence experiments, which revealed that this CMH is present on the surface of the mycelial and conidial forms of S. apiospermum. Treatment of S. apiospermum conidia with the Mab significantly reduced fungal growth. In addition, the Mab also enhanced the phagocytosis and killing of S. apiospermum by murine cells. In vitro assays were performed to evaluate the CMHs for their cytotoxic activities against the mammalian cell lines L.929 and RAW, and an inhibitory effect on cell proliferation was observed. Synergistic in vitro interactions were observed between the Mab against GlcCer and both amphotericin B (AmB) and itraconazole. Because Scedosporium species develop drug resistance, the number of available antifungal drugs is limited; our data indicate that combining immunotherapy with the available drugs might be a viable treatment option. These results suggest that in S. apiospermum, GlcCer are most likely cell wall components that are targeted by antifungal antibodies, which directly inhibit fungal development and enhance macrophage function; furthermore, these results suggest the combined use of monoclonal antibodies against GlcCer and antifungal drugs for antifungal immunotherapy."
https://openalex.org/W2071594300,"Gilles de la Tourette syndrome is a neuropsychiatric disorder characterized by motor and phonic tics that can be considered motor responses to preceding inner urges. It has been shown that Tourette patients have inferior performance in some motor learning tasks and reduced synaptic plasticity induced by transcranial magnetic stimulation. However, it has not been investigated whether altered synaptic plasticity is directly linked to impaired motor skill acquisition in Tourette patients. In this study, cortical plasticity was assessed by measuring motor-evoked potentials before and after paired associative stimulation in 14 Tourette patients (13 male; age 18–39) and 15 healthy controls (12 male; age 18–33). Tic and urge severity were assessed using the Yale Global Tic Severity Scale and the Premonitory Urges for Tics Scale. Motor learning was assessed 45 minutes after inducing synaptic plasticity and 9 months later, using the rotary pursuit task. On average, long-term potentiation-like effects in response to the paired associative stimulation were present in healthy controls but not in patients. In Tourette patients, long-term potentiation-like effects were associated with more and long-term depression-like effects with less severe urges and tics. While motor learning did not differ between patients and healthy controls 45 minutes after inducing synaptic plasticity, the learning curve of the healthy controls started at a significantly higher level than the Tourette patients' 9 months later. Induced synaptic plasticity correlated positively with motor skills in healthy controls 9 months later. The present study confirms previously found long-term improvement in motor performance after paired associative stimulation in healthy controls but not in Tourette patients. Tourette patients did not show long-term potentiation in response to PAS and also showed reduced levels of motor skill consolidation after 9 months compared to healthy controls. Moreover, synaptic plasticity appears to be related to symptom severity."
https://openalex.org/W2026843338,"Objectives To assess HIV incidence and its associated risk factors among young men who have sex with men (YMSM) in urban areas, China. Design The study used a prospective cohort study design and standard diagnostic tests. Methods A twelve-month prospective cohort study was conducted among YMSM (18–25 years old) in 8 large cities in China. The participants were recruited via snowball sampling. A total of 1102 HIV-negative YMSM completed baseline assessment, 878 YMSM participants completed 6-month follow-up, and 902 completed 12-month follow-up. HIV was screened by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and confirmed with Western Blot. Syphilis was screened via rapid plasma reagent and confirmed by treponema pallidum particle agglutination assay. Results 78 HIV seroconversions were identified within 1168.4 person-year observations yielding an incidence rate of 6.7 per 100 person-years. HIV seroconversion was associated with non-student status (RR = 2.61, 90% CI = 1.3–5.26), low HIV transmission knowledge (RR = 8.87, 90% CI = 2.16–36.43), and syphilis infection (RR = 5.04, 90% CI = 2.57–9.90). Conclusions Incidence of HIV among YMSM is high in urban areas of China. Interventions measures are required to contain the HIV epidemic within this population."
https://openalex.org/W1973932471,"COPII-coated vesicles mediate the transport of newly synthesized proteins from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi. SEC24 is the COPII component primarily responsible for recruitment of protein cargoes into nascent vesicles. There are four Sec24 paralogs in mammals, with mice deficient in SEC24A, -B, and -D exhibiting a wide range of phenotypes. We now report the characterization of mice with deficiency in the fourth Sec24 paralog, SEC24C. Although mice haploinsufficient for Sec24c exhibit no apparent abnormalities, homozygous deficiency results in embryonic lethality at approximately embryonic day 7. Tissue-specific deletion of Sec24c in hepatocytes, pancreatic cells, smooth muscle cells, and intestinal epithelial cells results in phenotypically normal mice. Thus, SEC24C is required in early mammalian development but is dispensable in a number of tissues, likely as a result of compensation by other Sec24 paralogs. The embryonic lethality resulting from loss of SEC24C occurs considerably later than the lethality previously observed in SEC24D deficiency; it is clearly distinct from the restricted neural tube phenotype of Sec24b null embryos and the mild hypocholesterolemic phenotype of adult Sec24a null mice. Taken together, these results demonstrate that the four Sec24 paralogs have developed unique functions over the course of vertebrate evolution."
https://openalex.org/W1964053427,"P2X receptors are ATP-gated ion channels involved in many physiological functions, and determination of ATP-recognition (AR) of P2X receptors will promote the development of new therapeutic agents for pain, inflammation, bladder dysfunction and osteoporosis. Recent crystal structures of the zebrafish P2X4 (zfP2X4) receptor reveal a large ATP-binding pocket (ABP) located at the subunit interface of zfP2X4 receptors, which is occupied by a conspicuous cluster of basic residues to recognize triphosphate moiety of ATP. Using the engineered affinity labeling and molecular modeling, at least three sites (S1, S2 and S3) within ABP have been identified that are able to recognize the adenine ring of ATP, implying the existence of at least three distinct AR modes in ABP. The open crystal structure of zfP2X4 confirms one of three AR modes (named AR1), in which the adenine ring of ATP is buried into site S1 while the triphosphate moiety interacts with clustered basic residues. Why architecture of ABP favors AR1 not the other two AR modes still remains unexplored. Here, we examine the potential role of inherent dynamics of head domain, a domain involved in ABP formation, in AR determinant of P2X4 receptors. In silico docking and binding free energy calculation revealed comparable characters of three distinct AR modes. Inherent dynamics of head domain, especially the downward motion favors the preference of ABP for AR1 rather than AR2 and AR3. Along with the downward motion of head domain, the closing movement of loop139–146 and loop169–183, and structural rearrangements of K70, K72, R298 and R143 enabled ABP to discriminate AR1 from other AR modes. Our observations suggest the essential role of head domain dynamics in determining AR of P2X4 receptors, allowing evaluation of new strategies aimed at developing specific blockers/allosteric modulators by preventing the dynamics of head domain associated with both AR and channel activation of P2X4 receptors."

The diversity of this fragment can be used to estimate the richness of the respective species. In this study, we explored the use of DNA barcoding in a group of ornamental freshwater fish of the genus Hyphessobrycon. We sequenced the COI from 10 species of Hyphessobrycon belonging to the ""Rosy Tetra Clade"" collected from the Amazon and Negro River basins and combined our results with published data. The average conspecific and congeneric Kimura 2-parameter distances were 2.3% and 19.3%, respectively. Six of the 10 species were easily distinguishable by DNA barcoding (H. bentosi, H. copelandi, H. eques, H. epicharis, H. pulchrippinis, and H. sweglesi), whereas the remaining species (H. erythrostigma, H. pyrrhonotus, H. rosaceus and H. socolofi) lacked reciprocal monophyly. Although the COI gene was not fully diagnostic, the discovery of distinct evolutionary units in certain Hyphessobrycon species under the same specific epithet as well as haplotype sharing between different species suggest that DNA barcoding is useful for species identification in this speciose genus."

However, less is known about the impact of neonatal immune challenge on future responses to noxious stimuli and the reactivity of neural substrates involved in analgesia. Here we demonstrate that rats exposed to Lipopolysaccharide (LPS; 0.05 mg/kg IP, Salmonella enteritidis) during postnatal day (PND) 3 and 5 displayed enhanced formalin-induced flinching but not licking following formalin injection at PND 22. This LPS-induced hyperalgesia was accompanied by distinct recruitment of supra-spinal regions involved in analgesia as indicated by significantly attenuated Fos-protein induction in the rostral dorsal periaqueductal grey (DPAG) as well as rostral and caudal axes of the ventrolateral PAG (VLPAG). Formalin injections were associated with increased Fos-protein labelling in lateral habenula (LHb) as compared to medial habenula (MHb), however the intensity of this labelling did not differ as a result of neonatal immune challenge. These data highlight the importance of neonatal immune priming in programming inflammatory pain sensitivity later in development and highlight the PAG as a possible mediator of this process."
https://openalex.org/W2062753490,"ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters are an ancient family of transmembrane proteins that utilize ATPase activity to move substrates across cell membranes. The ABCC subfamily of the ABC transporters includes active drug exporters (the multidrug resistance proteins (MRPs)) and a unique ATP-gated ion channel (cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR)). The CFTR channel shares gating principles with conventional ligand-gated ion channels, but the allosteric network that couples ATP binding at its nucleotide binding domains (NBDs) with conformational changes in its transmembrane helices (TMs) is poorly defined. It is also unclear whether the mechanisms that govern CFTR gating are conserved with the thermodynamically distinct MRPs. Here we report a new class of gain of function (GOF) mutation of a conserved proline at the base of the pore-lining TM6. Multiple substitutions of this proline promoted ATP-free CFTR activity and activation by the weak agonist, 5'-adenylyl-β,γ-imidodiphosphate (AMP-PNP). TM6 proline mutations exhibited additive GOF effects when combined with a previously reported GOF mutation located in an outer collar of TMs that surrounds the pore-lining TMs. Each TM substitution allosterically rescued the ATP sensitivity of CFTR gating when introduced into an NBD mutant with defective ATP binding. Both classes of GOF mutations also rescued defective drug export by a yeast MRP (Yor1p) with ATP binding defects in its NBDs. We conclude that the conserved TM6 proline helps set the energy barrier to both CFTR channel opening and MRP-mediated drug efflux and that CFTR channels and MRP pumps utilize similar allosteric mechanisms for coupling conformational changes in their translocation pathways to ATP binding at their NBDs."

https://openalex.org/W2045656909,"Rhipicephalus microplus is an obligate hematophagous ectoparasite of cattle and an important biological vector of Anaplasma marginale in tropical and subtropical regions. The primary determinants for A. marginale transmission are infection of the tick gut, followed by infection of salivary glands. Transmission of A. marginale to cattle occurs via infected saliva delivered during tick feeding. Interference in colonization of either the tick gut or salivary glands can affect transmission of A. marginale to naïve animals. In this study, we used the tick embryonic cell line BME26 to identify genes that are modulated in response to A. marginale infection. Suppression-subtractive hybridization libraries (SSH) were constructed, and five up-regulated genes {glutathione S-transferase (GST), cytochrome c oxidase sub III (COXIII), dynein (DYN), synaptobrevin (SYN) and phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-triphosphate 3-phosphatase (PHOS)} were selected as targets for functional in vivo genomic analysis. RNA interference (RNAi) was used to determine the effect of tick gene knockdown on A. marginale acquisition and transmission. Although RNAi consistently knocked down all individually examined tick genes in infected tick guts and salivary glands, only the group of ticks injected with dsCOXIII failed to transmit A. marginale to naïve calves. To our knowledge, this is the first report demonstrating that RNAi of a tick gene is associated with a failure of A. marginale transmission."
https://openalex.org/W2096431599,"Many habitat specialist species are originally composed of small, discontinuous populations because their habitats are naturally fragmented or patchy. They may have suffered the long-term effects of natural patchiness. Mediterranean heathlands, a representative habitat in the Strait of Gibraltar region, are associated with nutrient-poor, acidic sandstone soils. Sandstone soil patches in the African side of the Strait (Tangier) are, in general, smaller and more scattered than in the European side (Algeciras). In this study, we analyze the effect of this sandstone patchiness on the population genetic diversity and structure of two Erica species from these Mediterranean heathlands that differ in their edaphic specificity, E. australis, sandstone specialist, and E. arborea, generalist. Average levels of within-population genetic diversity and gene flow between populations were significantly lower in Tangier (high sandstone patchiness) than in Algeciras (low patchiness) for the sandstone specialist, whereas no differences between both sides of the Strait were detected in the edaphic generalist. Since most endemic species in Mediterranean heathlands of the Strait of Gibraltar are sandstone specialists, these results highlight an increased vulnerability to loss of genetic diversity and local extinction of the heathland endemic flora in the Tangier side of the Strait of Gibraltar."

PGRN production is also modulated by inflammation and infection, but no data are available on the production and role of PGRN during CNS HIV infection. Methods To determine the relationships between PGRN and HIV disease, neurocognition, and inflammation, we analyzed 107 matched CSF and plasma samples from CHARTER, a well-characterized HIV cohort. Levels of PGRN were determined by ELISA and compared to levels of several inflammatory mediators (IFNγ, IL-6, IL-10, IP-10, MCP-1, TNFα, IL-1β, IL-4 and IL-13), as well as clinical, virologic and demographic parameters. The relationship between HIV infection and PGRN was also examined in HIV-infected primary human microglial cultures. Results In plasma, PGRN levels correlated with the viral load (VL, p<0.001). In the CSF of subjects with undetectable VL, lower PGRN was associated with neurocognitive impairment (p = 0.046). CSF PGRN correlated with CSF IP-10, TNFα and IL-10, and plasma PGRN correlated with plasma IP-10. In vitro, microglial HIV infection increased PGRN production and PGRN knockdown increased HIV replication, demonstrating that PGRN is an innate antiviral protein. Conclusions We propose that PGRN plays dual roles in people living with HIV disease. With active HIV replication, PGRN is induced in infected macrophages and microglia and functions as an antiviral protein. In individuals without active viral replication, decreased PGRN production contributes to neurocognitive dysfunction, probably through a diminution of its neurotrophic functions. Our results have implications for the pathogenesis, biomarker studies and therapy for HIV diseases including HIV-associated neurocognitive dysfunction (HAND)."
https://openalex.org/W2050341271,"The serotonin transporter (SERT) is a key regulator of serotonergic signalling as it mediates the re-uptake of synaptic serotonin into nerve terminals, thereby terminating or modulating its signal. It is well-known that SERT regulation is a dynamic process orchestrated by a wide array of proteins and mechanisms. However, molecular details on possible coordinated regulation of SERT activity and 5-HT release are incomplete. Here, we report that vesicle-associated membrane protein 2 (VAMP2), a SNARE protein that mediates vesicle fusion with the plasma membrane, interacts with SERT. This was documented in vitro, through GST pull-down assays, by co-immunoprecipitation experiments on heterologous cells and rat hippocampal synaptosomes, and with FRET analysis in live transfected HEK-293 MSR cells. The related isoforms VAMP1 and VAMP3 also physically interact with SERT. However, comparison of the three VAMP isoforms shows that only VAMP2 possesses a functionally distinct role in relation to SERT. VAMP2 influences 5-HT uptake, cell surface expression and the delivery rate of SERT to the plasma membrane differentially in HEK-293 MSR and PC12 cells. Moreover, siRNA-mediated knock-down of endogenous VAMP2 reduces 5-HT uptake in CAD cells stably expressing low levels of heterologous SERT. Deletion and mutant analysis suggest a role for the isoform specific C-terminal domain of VAMP2 in regulating SERT function. Our data identify a novel interaction between SERT and a synaptic vesicle protein and support a link between 5-HT release and re-uptake."

The optimum dosage of CPAM was negatively correlated with its CD or MW if the CD or MW of CPAM was above 20% or 5 million. In the centrifugal dewatering of sludge, the moisture content in the conditioned sludge gradually decreased with the extension of centrifugation time, and the economical centrifugal force was 400×g. The moisture evaporation rates of the conditioned sludge were closely related to sludge dewaterability, which was in turn significantly correlated either positively with the solid content of sludge particles that were >2 mm in size or negatively with that of particles measuring 1 mm to 2 mm in diameter. During treatment, sludge moisture content was reduced from 80% to 20% by evaporation, and the moisture evaporation rates were 1.35, 1.49, 1.62, and 2.24 times faster in the sludge conditioned using 4 mg g−1 CPAM with 5 million MW and 60% CD than in the sludge conditioned using 4 mg g−1 CPAM with 8 million MW and 40% CD, 6 mg g−1 CPAM with 5 million MW and 40% CD, 6 mg g−1 CPAM with 3 million MW and 40% CD, and 10 mg g−1 CPAM with 5 million MW and 20% CD, respectively.

We identify individualistic changes in relative detectability among populations between sampling periods at different elevations. Both common and rare species showed site-specific declines, and no species exhibited significant declines at both sites. Detection changes are correlated with changes in temperature, dry season rainfall, and leaf litter depth since1969.

These residues are well conserved among P-loop NTPases. In this study, we investigated the role of these charged residues in catalysis and torque generation by analyzing alanine-substituted mutants in the single-molecule rotation assay. Surprisingly, all mutants continuously drove rotary motion, even though the rotational velocity was at least 100,000 times slower than that of wild type. Thus, although these charged residues contribute to highly efficient catalysis, they are not indispensable to chemo-mechanical energy coupling, and the rotary catalysis mechanism of F1 is far more robust than previously thought.

Molecular machines, fueled by nucleotide triphosphate (NTP), play pivotal roles in a wide range of cellular activities, such as gene regulation, organelle transport, membrane transport, protein unfolding, signal transduction, and energy synthesis. Many of these exert mechanical force on their substrates or associated proteins through conformational changes that occur during NTP hydrolysis (1Vale R.D. Milligan R.A.

The most highly conserved primary structure among the NTPases is the phosphate-binding loop (P-loop) comprised of the amino acid sequence GXXXXGK(T/S) (where X varies). The P-loop sequence motif was first reported by Walker et al. (3Walker J.E. Saraste M. Runswick M.J. Gay N.J. Distantly related sequences in the α- and β-subunits of ATP synthase, myosin, kinases and other ATP-requiring enzymes and a common nucleotide binding fold.EMBO J. 1982; 1: 945-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (4248) Google Scholar) and is therefore referred to as a Walker A motif. Additionally, the lysine is the most crucial residue for NTP hydrolysis among the P-loop residues (2Hanson P.I. Whiteheart S.W. AAA+ proteins: have engine, will work.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 519-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (890) Google Scholar). Some subfamilies of NTP-driven molecular machines share other catalytically crucial residues that are also electrically charged. Catalytic glutamic acid is found in the nucleotide-binding pocket of many subfamilies of NTPases, such as the AAA+ proteins, ABC transporters, and RecA-type proteins, although the catalytic glutamic acid of RecA-type proteins occupies a different position in the secondary structure compared with other subfamilies (4Muneyuki E.

Because this residue seems to induce an in-line attack of the water molecule to γ-phosphate and initiate the hydrolysis reaction by activating the water molecule, the carboxylate residue is termed the “general base.” Note that recent theoretical studies have revised the actual working mechanism of the general base in catalysis (5Hayashi S.

AAA+ proteins: have engine, will work.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 519-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (890) Google Scholar). The most studied catalytic arginine is the “arginine finger” of the G-protein-activating protein, which triggers GTP hydrolysis of the G-protein (7Scheffzek K. Ahmadian M.R. Kabsch W. Wiesmüller L.

The Ras-RasGAP complex: structural basis for GTPase activation and its loss in oncogenic Ras mutants.Science. 1997; 277: 333-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (1195) Google Scholar). Several studies have reported that the arginine finger stabilizes the transition state of hydrolysis to enhance catalysis. Both AAA+ proteins and RecA-type proteins such as RecA and F1-ATPase also carry the corresponding arginine (or lysine in RecA) in the same region of the arginine finger of G-protein-activating protein (8Abrahams J.P.

Mutation at these charged residues is fatal for NTPase catalysis and is particularly so when substituted with either a noncharged or an oppositely charged residue, which reduces the catalytic power to undetectable levels in biochemical assays (10Yagi H.

Substitution of alanine (Ala) or another noncharged residue for the P-loop lysine (Lys), the most highly conserved of these residues, is the approach used most frequently to knock down the catalytic power of NTPases. However, an explanation as to how the electric charge of these catalytically crucial residues contributes to force generation has remained elusive due to the difficulty of investigating these effects while simultaneously retaining hydrolytic activity. In this study, we evaluated the effects of alanine mutation of the catalytically crucial charged residues on catalytic efficiencies and force generation in a highly sensitive single-molecule assay using the F1-ATPase rotary motor as a model NTP-driven molecular machine. F1-ATPase (F1), 3The abbreviations used are: F1F1-ATPasepNpiconewton. the water-soluble portion of the F0F1-ATP synthase, is a member of the RecA-type protein family and possesses all of the catalytically crucial charged residues: P-loop Lys, the general base, and the Arg finger. When isolated from the ATP synthase complex, F1 acts as a rotary motor protein, where it rotates the inner rotary subunit against the stator ring, hydrolyzing ATP (13Yoshida M. Muneyuki E.

The bacterial type F1 is composed of α3β3γδϵ, with the α3β3γ subcomplex representing the minimum complex necessary to function as a rotary motor. The α3β3 subunits form the cylindrical stator ring. The γ subunit is the rotary shaft that penetrates the center of the cylinder (8Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G. Lutter R. Walker J.E.

Therefore, conformational changes of the β subunit are responsible for torque generation. The rotary torque of F1 has repeatedly been reported to be 40 pN·nm for F1 from thermophilic bacteria and the Bacillus PS3 that was investigated in this study (18Yasuda R. Noji H. Kinosita Jr., K.

Among motor proteins, F1 is unique for its high reversibility in a chemo-mechanical coupling reaction, i.e. F1 catalyzes ATP synthesis when the rotary shaft is forcibly rotated in the reverse direction (21Rondelez Y. Tresset G. Nakashima T. Kato-Yamada Y. Fujita H. Takeuchi S. Noji H. Highly coupled ATP synthesis by F1-ATPase single molecules.Nature. 2005; 433: 773-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar, 22Itoh H. Takahashi A. Adachi K. Noji H. Yasuda R. Yoshida M. Kinosita K. Mechanically driven ATP synthesis by F1-ATPase.Nature. 2004; 427: 465-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). In cells, F1 binds to Fo, the membrane-embedded part of ATP synthase, to form the whole ATP synthase complex. Under physiological conditions, Fo, powered by the proton-motive force across the membranes, generates a larger torque than F1, thereby reversing F1 to induce the ATP synthesis reaction. This high reversibility means that each reaction step is tightly coupled with a rotary motion of the γ subunit. The tight coupling feature also allows us to elucidate kinetic analysis of individual catalytic reactions from observations of the rotary motion. To establish a basis for studying the chemo-mechanical coupling mechanism of F1, the reaction scheme of F1 was extensively researched. Although most aspects of the scheme have been resolved, some uncertainties remained (23Weber J. Structural biology: Toward the ATP synthase mechanism.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2010; 6: 794-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Rotations reportedly occur in discrete 120° steps, each coupled to a single turnover of ATP hydrolysis (18Yasuda R. Noji H.

F1-ATPase is a highly efficient molecular motor that rotates with discrete 120 degree steps.Cell. 1998; 93: 1117-1124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar). The 120° step is further divided into 80 and 40° substeps (24Yasuda R. Noji H. Yoshida M. Kinosita Jr., K. Itoh H.

U.S.A. 2003; 100: 14731-14736Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). The 80° substep is triggered by ATP binding and ADP release, each of which occurs on different β subunits (26Adachi K. Oiwa K. Nishizaka T. Furuike S. Noji H. Itoh H. Yoshida M. Kinosita Jr., K.

The 40° substep is triggered by ATP hydrolysis and release of inorganic phosphate (Pi), which also occurs on different β subunits (26Adachi K. Oiwa K. Nishizaka T. Furuike S. Noji H. Itoh H.

The angular positions of the dwell before the 80 and 40° substeps are referred to as the ATP-binding and catalytic angles, respectively. Establishment of the basic reaction scheme has led to the more fundamental question of determining how the locally occurring chemical reaction induces the large conformational change of the motor protein. Previous molecular genetics and biochemical studies have identified the catalytic residues of F1 based on sequence homology and chemical modifications with ATP analogues (28Nakamoto R.K. Shin K.

All of these studies have identified the abovementioned charged residues as the catalytically critical residues, although some additional residues were also found to be involved in catalysis. Interestingly, when these charged residues are substituted with noncharged or oppositely charged residues, F1 catalytic activity is reduced to undetectable levels in biochemical ATPase assays (10Yagi H.

However, no data have been presented that clearly explain how the electric charges of these residues contribute to force generation of F1. Recently, a single-molecule assay of F1 provided quantitative analysis of very low catalytic activity (i.e. less than 0.005 s−1), which was lower than the detection limit of the biochemical ATPase assay (about 0.3 s−1) (35Amano T.

Spatial precision of a catalytic carboxylate of F1-ATPase β subunit probed by introducing different carboxylate-containing side chains.FEBS Lett. 1994; 348: 93-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Therefore, in this work we re-assessed the catalytic competence of the alanine mutant of the conserved charged residues using this single-molecule rotation assay. All of these mutants exhibited unidirectional rotation, indicating unexpectedly high robustness of catalytic competency. Additionally, we analyzed the impact of the mutation on torque generation. Wild-type F1 and the F1 mutants F1(αR364A), F1(βK164A), F1(βE190A), and F1(βE190Q) were prepared as reported previously (38Okuno D. Iino R. Noji H. Stiffness of γ subunit of F1-ATPase.Eur. Biophys. J. 2010; 39: 1589-1596Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). To visualize the rotation of F1, the stator region (α3β3) was fixed onto a glass surface, and magnetic beads (Seradyn, Indianapolis, IN) were attached to the rotor (γ) as a rotation probe, as reported previously (27Watanabe R. Iino R. Noji H. Phosphate release in F1-ATPase catalytic cycle follows ADP release.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2010; 6: 814-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The rotating beads were observed under a phase-contrast microscope (IX-70 or IX-71, Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). The rotation assay was performed at 25 °C. The images of rotary motion were recorded at 30–2,000 frames/s (FASTCAM 1024PCI-SE, Photron, Tokyo, Japan; FC300M, Takex, Kyoto, Japan). Images were stored on the HDD of a computer as AVI files and analyzed using custom-made software. The arginine finger (αR364), the P-loop lysine (βK164), and the general base (βE190) of F1 from thermophilic Bacillus PS3 (TF1) were substituted with alanine to produce the F1 mutants, F1(αR364A), F1(βK164A), and F1(βE190A) (Fig. 1, a and b). βE190A was also substituted with glutamine to produce F1(βE190Q). The ATPase activity of all mutants was undetectable with biochemical assays, which was consistent with the results of previous studies (10Yagi H. Kajiwara N. Iwabuchi T. Izumi K. Yoshida M. Akutsu H.

The rotation assay was conducted at a saturating ATP concentration (1 mm) by using magnetic beads as rotation markers. Surprisingly, all mutants exhibited continuous rotary motions in an anticlockwise direction (Fig. 1c), although rotation was extremely slow, in some instances taking as long as 5 min to confirm. Nonetheless, the observed rotation indicated that all of the mutants retained the catalytic power of ATP hydrolysis and their chemomechanical coupling nature. The rotational rate of these mutants ranged from 0.002 to 0.1 rps (Fig. 1c). The slowest rotation was observed for F1(βE190Q). As seen in the time courses in Fig. 1, c and d, all the mutants exhibited distinct pauses every 120° throughout the rotation, which limited the overall rotation rate. This observation is significant, as it indicates that one or more catalytic reaction steps are distinctively slowed. The rotational rates of mutants were measured at various ATP concentrations ranging from 1 μm to 30 mm (Fig. 1e). The mutant F1(αR364A) rarely exhibited continuous rotations at low ATP concentrations (less than 1 μm) due to severe inhibition, which did not allow for the assay to detect rotation at an ATP concentration less than 1 μm. The other mutants were observed to follow Michaelis-Menten kinetics, yielding maximum rotation rates (Vmax) and Michaelis constants (Km). Assuming that the chemomechanical coupling ratio of F1 was three ATPs/turn, 3 × Vmax represented the catalytic turnover rate (kcat), and these values were calculated to be 3.3 × 10−1, 2.2 × 10−2, 1.3 × 10−1, and 6.6 × 10−3 s−1 for F1(αR364A), F1(βK164A), F1(βE190A), and F1(βE190Q), respectively (Table 1). The rate constants of ATP binding (konATP) that were determined as 3 × Vmax/Km, were 9.0 × 102, 3.7 × 106, and 4.5 × 106 m−1 s−1 for F1(βK164A), F1(βE190A), and F1(βE190Q), respectively. Compared with kcat and konATP from the wild type (387 s−1 and 2.6 × 107 m−1 s−1, respectively), the impact of the depletion of the conserved charge was significant in the suppression of kcat, whereas the P-loop lysine mutant also resulted in remarkable suppression of konATP. This indicated that the P-loop lysine is involved in both the binding process and catalysis.TABLE 1Kinetic parameters, Stiffness and TorquekonkcatStiffnessTorques−1 m−1s−1pN·nmpN·nmWild typeaData were measured previously (38, 44).2.6 × 1073.9 × 1027843βE190A4.9 × 1061.3 × 10−13825βE190Q1.6 × 1069.3 × 10−3NDbND means not determined.NDβK164A5.2 × 1012.8 × 10−22110αR364A2.4 × 1044.1 × 10−14228a Data were measured previously (38Okuno D.

Open table in a new tab It is known that F1 has two stable states, pausing at either the binding angle or the catalytic angle, with the latter angle calculated at +80° from the binding angle, in the anticlockwise direction. We therefore attempted to determine the angles where these pauses occurred for the mutants. For the analysis of F1(βE190A), we conducted a buffer exchange experiment where the ATP concentration was changed from 1 mm to 50 nm, which was comparable with the Km value of this mutant (Fig. 2a). When the buffer was changed to 50 nm, the mutant exhibited substeps, characterized by pauses at six distinct positions (Fig. 2b). For statistical analysis, we compared the angular position of the pauses appearing at 50 nm ATP from the original pauses at 1 mm ATP for individual rotating molecules (Δθ2 in Fig. 2, b and c). For comparison, the relative angular positions of the original intervening pauses at two ATP concentrations (Δθ1 in Fig. 2, b and c) were also analyzed. The results of this analysis indicated that Δθ1 was −1.7 ± 6.4°, which validated this experimental approach, whereas Δθ2 was 33 ± 9.2°. These results indicated that the intervening pauses of F1(βE190A) occurred at the same catalytic angle as that previously reported for an aspartic acid mutant at βGlu-190 (25Shimabukuro K. Yasuda R. Muneyuki E. Hara K.Y. Kinosita Jr., K. Yoshida M. Catalysis and rotation of F1 motor: cleavage of ATP at the catalytic site occurs in 1 ms before 40 degree substep rotation.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 14731-14736Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). When we conducted the same buffer exchange experiment for F1(βE190Q), we observed that the intervening pause of F1(βE190Q) also occurred at the catalytic pauses (Fig. 2, d–f). Thus, the mutation at the general base caused the distinctly long pause at the catalytic angle. We also analyzed the dwell time of the intervening pause of F1(βE190A) and F1(βE190Q), as well as the dwell time of the ATP-waiting pause (Fig. 3). The histograms of the dwell times were fit to single exponential functions y = C··exp(−kt), allowing us to determine kcat and konATP (Fig. 3, a and c). konATP was proportional to [ATP], but kcat was not (Fig. 3, b and d). konATP was 4.9 × 106 and 1.7 × 106 m−1 s−1, and kcat was 0.13, 9.3 × 10−3 s−1 for F1(βE190A) or F1(βE190Q) (Fig. 5, a and b). These values were consistent with the aforementioned Michaelis-Menten analysis (Fig. 1e).FIGURE 3Kinetic analysis of βGlu-190 mutants. a, histograms of the dwell time of F1(βE190A) at ATP binding angle (top) or catalytic angle (bottom) in the presence of 1 μm (right), 100 nm (middle), and 10 nm ATP (left).

To spatially and temporally evaluate how transport defects are initiated, we adapted a primary neuronal culture system from Drosophila larval brains to visualize the movement dynamics of several cargos/organelles along a 90 micron axonal neurite over time. All six vesicles/organelles imaged showed robust bi-directional motility at both day 1 and day 2. Reduction of motor proteins decreased the movement of vesicles/organelles with increased numbers of neurite blocks. Neuronal growth was also perturbed with reduction of motor proteins. Strikingly, we found that all blockages were not fixed, permanent blocks that impeded transport of vesicles as previously thought, but that some blocks were dynamic clusters of vesicles that resolved over time. Taken together, our findings suggest that non-resolving blocks may likely initiate deleterious pathways leading to death and degeneration, while resolving blocks may be benign. Therefore evaluating the spatial and temporal characteristics of vesicle transport has important implications for our understanding of how transport defects can affect other pathways to initiate death and degeneration."

The present study aimed to understand the life cycle and growth of Alona iheringula Kotov & Sinev, 2004 (Crustacea, Anomopoda, Chydoridae), a Neotropical species, as well as its DNA barcoding, providing new information on the Aloninae taxonomy. The specimens were collected in the dammed portion of the Cabo Verde River (21°26′05″ S and 46°10′57″ W), in the Furnas Reservoir, Minas Gerais State, Brazil. Forty neonates were observed individually two or three times a day under controlled temperature (25±1°C), photoperiod (12 h light/12 h dark) and feeding (Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata at a concentration of 105 cells.mL−1 and a mixed suspension of yeast and fish feed in equal proportion). Individual body growth was measured daily under optical microscope using a micrometric grid and 40× magnification. The species had a mean size of 413(±29) µm, a maximum size of 510 µm and reached maturity at 3.24(±0.69) days of age. Mean fecundity was 2 eggs per female per brood and the mean number of eggs produced per female during the entire life cycle was 47.6(±6.3) eggs per female. The embryonic development time was 1.79(±0.23) days and the maximum longevity was 54 days. The species had eight instars throughout its life cycle and four instars between neonate and primipara stage. The present study using molecular data (a 461 bp smaller COI fragment) demonstrated a deep divergence in the Aloninae subfamily."

https://openalex.org/W2004676050,"In Antarctica this week, the daylight is dimming as the polar night approaches. “The weather is pretty changing at the moment. There are a lot of low-pressure systems coming from the Weddell Sea, leading to high wind speeds up to 55 knots and a lot of snowdrift,” says meteorologist Elena Stautzebach. She is part of a small team of early-career scientists overwintering at the German research base Neumayer-Station III. “In between, we have periods of sunny weather and temperatures around −10°C.” But the darkness will be continuous starting on 28 May. It will last 56 days. Located 450 kilometers from its closest neighbor, the station has a proud meteorological history: Scientists have conducted measurements and observations there every 3 hours for more than 30 years. Many measurements run on a programmed schedule. But visual observations—cloud and weather conditions, air pressure, dew-point temperature, wind speed and direction, and visibility, for example—must be made by people, rather, a person. “We have just one meteorologist, who has to sleep now and then,” says the team's lead off-continent contact, Gert Konig-Langlo of the Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research in Germany. This winter, that meteorologist is Stautzebach. The team operates on Coordinated Universal Time. At 9 a.m., noon, 3 p.m., 6 p.m., 9 p.m., and midnight, she is outside collecting data, whatever the weather.

“As it gets darker, it is getting more difficult to distinguish between different cloud layers and types. Observations are therefore taking a lot longer without daylight, as you have to stay outside longer in order to adapt your eyes to the darkness. But this also means that you have time to watch the beautiful stars of the Southern Hemisphere and that you have higher chances of seeing polar lights,” she says.

To ensure that her measurements are accurate, Stautzebach must do daily rounds, dusting snow and breaking off ice crystals from 10 radiation sensors, two ventilated temperature sensors, two wind anemometers (one of them 10 meters above the ground), three humidity sensors, and snow depth and air pressure sensors—all located 200 meters from the station to avoid wind and shadow influences. Stautzebach also climbs up on the station's roof to check the visibility sensor and the ceilometer, which detects cloud height.

As the temperature drops, Stautzebach will start to travel 20 kilometers by snowmobile every 3 weeks to Atka Bay, where she will measure the first growth of sea ice and platelet ice. As winter digs in, the ice will become strong enough to support an automated meteorological station equipped with radiation sensors.

“Overwintering and being in charge of a scientific observatory in Antarctica is a challenge,” Stautzebach says. “During the winter season, we have to deal with all sorts of situations on our own. Our team includes one engineer who is responsible for the functioning of the entire station, one IT-specialist who has to maintain the communication with the world outside Antarctica, and one doctor. Additionally, in case of a fire, we have to turn into our own firefighters.”

Winter for the team officially started at the end of February “when the last plane left Antarctica,” Stautzebach says. “We are now on our own until November.” The nine-person team will then continue its work through the following Antarctic summer, helping the next overwintering team prepare for what is coming.

“Now that I am in Antarctica, the continent with the harshest weather conditions in the world, I can't wait to experience probably the most extreme weather in my life. Even more exciting than cold temperatures are storm events with snowdrift and whiteouts. As soon as the highest wind speeds of a storm event are reached, I often go outside with one of my colleagues (and a radio and GPS of course) in order to experience the strength of the wind.

“This winter I will simply enjoy the harsh weather conditions in Antarctica, and as soon as I am back in Europe, I'll think back to storm events that I had the chance to experience down here.”
