Taking advantage of the regeneration abilities of zebrafish and the newly generated leukocyte-specific zebrafish lines with labeling of both leukocyte lineages, we assessed the behaviors and functions of neutrophils and macrophages during tail fin regeneration. Live imaging showed that within 6 hours post amputation, the inflammatory stage, neutrophils were the primary cells scavenging apoptotic bodies and small cell debris, although they had limited phagocytic capacity and quickly underwent apoptosis. From 6 hours post amputation on, the resolution and regeneration stage, macrophages became the dominant scavengers, efficiently resolving inflammation and facilitating tissue remodeling and regrowth. Ablation of macrophages but not neutrophils severely impaired the inflammatory resolution and tissue regeneration, resulting in the formation of large vacuoles in the regenerated fins. In contrast, removal of neutrophils slightly accelerates the regrowth of injured fin. Our study documents the differing behaviors and functions of macrophages and neutrophils during tissue regeneration."
https://openalex.org/W1981125871,"Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is an important cytokine participating in multiple biologic activities in immune regulation and inflammation. IL-6 has been associated with cardiovascular remodeling. However, the mechanism of IL-6 in hypertensive cardiac fibrosis is still unclear. Angiotensin II (Ang II) infusion in mice increased IL-6 expression in the heart. IL-6 knockout (IL-6-/-) reduced Ang II-induced cardiac fibrosis: 1) Masson trichrome staining showed that Ang II infusion significantly increased fibrotic areas of the wild-type mouse heart, which was greatly suppressed in IL-6-/- mice and 2) immunohistochemistry staining showed decreased expression of α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA), transforming growth factor β1 (TGF-β1) and collagen I in IL-6-/- mouse heart. The baseline mRNA expression of IL-6 in cardiac fibroblasts was low and was absent in cardiomyocytes or macrophages; however, co-culture of cardiac fibroblasts with macrophages significantly increased IL-6 production and expression of α-SMA and collagen I in fibroblasts. Moreover, TGF-β1 expression and phosphorylation of TGF-β downstream signal Smad3 was stimulated by co-culture of macrophages with cardiac fibroblasts, while IL-6 neutralizing antibody decreased TGF-β1 expression and Smad3 phosphorylation in co-culture of macrophage and fibroblast. Taken together, our results indicate that macrophages stimulate cardiac fibroblasts to produce IL-6, which leads to TGF-β1 production and Smad3 phosphorylation in cardiac fibroblasts and thus stimulates cardiac fibrosis."
https://openalex.org/W1964772492,"Fluorescent proteins derived from light, oxygen, or voltage (LOV) domains offer advantages over green fluorescent protein (GFP) from their small size and efficacy under anaerobic conditions. The flavoprotein improved LOV (iLOV) was engineered from the blue light receptor phototropin as a reporter of viral infection. To inform the molecular basis for the improved, photoreversible, fluorescent properties of iLOV, we employed directed evolution and determined five LOV crystallographic structures. Comparative structural analyses between iLOV and its progenitors reveal mutation-induced constraints in the environment of the flavin mononucleotide (FMN) chromophore; in iLOV, the methyl group of Thr-394 ""crowds"" the FMN isoalloxazine ring, Leu-470 triggers side chain ""flipping"" of Leu-472, and the terminal FMN phosphate shows increased anchoring. We further engineered iLOV variants that are readily detectable in bacterial and mammalian cells due to order-of-magnitude photostability increases. Structure determination of a resulting representative photostable iLOV (phiLOV) variant reveals additional constraints on the chromophore. Aromatic residues Tyr-401 and Phe-485 in phiLOV sandwich the FMN isoalloxazine ring from both sides, whereas Ser-390 anchors the side chain of FMN-interacting Gln-489 Our combined structural and mutational results reveal that constraining the FMN fluorophore yields improved photochemical properties for iLOV and its new photostable derivative. These findings provide a framework for structural fine-tuning of LOV scaffold proteins to maximize their potential as oxygen-independent fluorescent reporters."
https://openalex.org/W2046521626,"Uterine leiomyoma is the most common benign tumor in reproductive-age women. Each leiomyoma is thought to be a benign monoclonal tumor arising from a single transformed myometrial smooth muscle cell; however, it is not known what leiomyoma cell type is responsible for tumor growth. Thus, we tested the hypothesis that a distinct stem/reservoir cell-enriched population, designated as the leiomyoma-derived side population (LMSP), is responsible for cell proliferation and tumor growth.LMSP comprised approximately 1% of all leiomyoma and 2% of all myometrium-derived cells. All LMSP and leiomyoma-derived main population (LMMP) but none of the side or main population cells isolated from adjacent myometrium carried a mediator complex subunit 12 mutation, a genetic marker of neoplastic transformation. Messenger RNA levels for estrogen receptor-α, progesterone receptor and smooth muscle cell markers were barely detectable and significantly lower in the LMSP compared with the LMMP. LMSP alone did not attach or survive in monolayer culture in the presence or absence of estradiol and progestin, whereas LMMP readily grew under these conditions. LMSP did attach and survive when directly mixed with unsorted myometrial cells in monolayer culture. After resorting and reculturing, LMSP gained full potential of proliferation. Intriguingly, xenografts comprised of LMSP and unsorted myometrial smooth muscle cells grew into relatively large tumors (3.67 ± 1.07 mm(3)), whereas xenografts comprised of LMMP and unsorted myometrial smooth muscle cells produced smaller tumors (0.54 ± 0.20 mm(3), p<0.05, n = 10 paired patient samples). LMSP xenografts displayed significantly higher proliferative activity compared with LMMP xenografts (p<0.05).Our data suggest that LMSP, which have stem/reservoir cell characteristics, are necessary for in vivo growth of leiomyoma xenograft tumors. Lower estrogen and progesterone receptor levels in LMSP suggests an indirect paracrine effect of steroid hormones on stem cells via the mature neighboring cells."

To study the interaction of complexes I, III, and IV within the bovine heart mitochondria respirasome, three-dimensional EM maps of the respirasome composed of one complex I, one complex III, and one complex IV (supercomplex I1III2IV1) were recently obtained by two different approaches (20Althoff T. Mills D.J. Popot J.L. Kühlbrandt W. Arrangement of electron transport chain components in bovine mitochondrial supercomplex I(1)III(2)IV(1).EMBO J. 2011; 30: 4652-4664Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 22Dudkina N.V.

U.S.A. 2011; 108: 15196-15200Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). One group performed cryo-electron tomography and sub-volume averaging of the purified detergent-solubilized respirasome (22Dudkina N.V. Kudryashev M. Stahlberg H. Boekema E.J. Interaction of complexes I, III, and IV within the bovine respirasome by single particle cryoelectron tomography.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2011; 108: 15196-15200Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Another group used cryo-EM and single particle analysis of the amphipol-solubilized bovine respirasome (20Althoff T. Mills D.J. Popot J.L. Kühlbrandt W. Arrangement of electron transport chain components in bovine mitochondrial supercomplex I(1)III(2)IV(1).EMBO J. 2011; 30: 4652-4664Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). There is a good agreement between the three-dimensional EM maps obtained by these two approaches. Docking of x-ray crystal structures of individual complexes showed a good agreement using both methods for the interacting surfaces of complexes III and IV and the orientation of complex IV relative to complex III. However, the above organization differs considerably from that for the same supercomplex deduced from a three-dimensional map determined by negative stain EM (23Schäfer E. Dencher N.A. Vonck J. Parcej D.N. Three-dimensional structure of the respiratory chain supercomplex I1III2IV1 from bovine heart mitochondria.Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 12579-12585Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). S. cerevisiae lacks complex I, and the peripheral dehydrogenases are not found associated with respirasome complexes after solubilization from the mitochondrial membrane by detergents (24Schägger H. Pfeiffer K. Supercomplexes in the respiratory chains of yeast and mammalian mitochondria.EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1777-1783Crossref PubMed Scopus (1036) Google Scholar, 25Cruciat C.M. Brunner S. Baumann F.

Chem. 2000; 275: 18093-18098Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). The supercomplex, composed of complex III and two complexes IV (III2IV2) was previously studied by using negative stain EM (26Heinemeyer J. Braun H.P. Boekema E.J. Kouril R. A structural model of the cytochrome c reductase/oxidase supercomplex from yeast mitochondria.J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 12240-12248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Analysis of two-dimensional class averages resulted in a proposed three-dimensional arrangement of the individual complexes in which complex III is flanked on each side by a monomer of complex IV (supercomplex IV1-III2-IV1). The suggested orientation of complexes IV toward complex III in yeast differs considerably from that deduced from the cryo-EM map of the bovine supercomplex (20Althoff T. Mills D.J. Popot J.L. Kühlbrandt W. Arrangement of electron transport chain components in bovine mitochondrial supercomplex I(1)III(2)IV(1).EMBO J. 2011; 30: 4652-4664Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 22Dudkina N.V. Kudryashev M. Stahlberg H. Boekema E.J. Interaction of complexes I, III, and IV within the bovine respirasome by single particle cryoelectron tomography.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2011; 108: 15196-15200Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Given the differences in the structures of the bovine supercomplex determined by single particle analysis using negative-stain EM versus cryo-EM, a reinvestigation of the yeast supercomplex structure by cryo-EM is warranted. Here we present for the first time a three-dimensional map of a S. cerevisiae supercomplex organization obtained by cryo-EM and single particle analysis. Our three-dimensional map determined by cryo-EM reveals more structural details because only a very limited number of views were presented in the negative stain two-dimensional EM class averages (26Heinemeyer J. Braun H.P. Boekema E.J. Kouril R. A structural model of the cytochrome c reductase/oxidase supercomplex from yeast mitochondria.J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 12240-12248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). In addition, we obtained more details with respect to the transmembrane part of the supercomplex, which was not resolved by negative stain-EM (26Heinemeyer J. Braun H.P. Boekema E.J. Kouril R. A structural model of the cytochrome c reductase/oxidase supercomplex from yeast mitochondria.J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 12240-12248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). By docking the atomic x-ray structures of complex III from yeast and complex IV from bovine heart into our three-dimensional EM map of the supercomplex, we constructed a pseudo-atomic model of the three-dimensional structure of the supercomplex. Our model in general supports the structure of the yeast supercomplex suggested previously from negative stain data (26Heinemeyer J. Braun H.P. Boekema E.J. Kouril R. A structural model of the cytochrome c reductase/oxidase supercomplex from yeast mitochondria.J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 12240-12248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Thus our findings definitely establish that the arrangement of complex IV with respect to complex III in the yeast supercomplex differs significantly from that found in the bovine supercomplex. At the same time our model assumes some specific differences in the interaction of the complexes III and IV compared with atomic model of the yeast supercomplex suggested from negative stain two-dimensional EM class averages. Finally, since the phospholipid CL is required for formation and stabilization of the supercomplex (see above), we also examined the CL species and content in the supercomplex by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS). S. cerevisiae strain USY00b (Mat α, ade2-1, his3-11-15, leu2-3-112, trp1-1, ura3-52, can1R-100, atp2::LEU2, TRP1::ATP2-His6) was supplied by Dr. David Mueller (Rosalind Franklin University of Medicine and Science, North Chicago, IL) and expresses the FoF1-ATPase β-subunit with a His6 extension (27Mueller D.M. Puri N. Kabaleeswaran V. Terry C. Leslie A.G. Walker J.E. Ni-chelate-affinity purification and crystallization of the yeast mitochondrial F1-ATPase.Protein Expr. Purif. 2004; 37: 479-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The strain was cultivated in YP-lactate growth medium (pH 5.6) containing 1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, and 3.7% of lactic acid. The cells were harvested (A600 of 2.0) by centrifugation and washed with cold TBS buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4 containing 150 mm NaCl). Mitochondria were isolated from spheroplasts of yeast cells as previously described (10Zhang M. Mileykovskaya E. Dowhan W.

Isolated mitochondria were further purified by centrifugation at 30,000 rpm (SW41 Ti) at 4 °C for 90 min through a density gradient containing 60, 32, 23, and 15% layers of sucrose in 15 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4 and 20 mm KCl. Mitochondria were either used immediately or flash-frozen with liquid N2 and stored at −80 °C. Mitoplasts (mitochondria without the outer mitochondrial membrane) for phospholipid analysis were prepared from purified mitochondria according to the protocol described in (10Zhang M.

Isolated mitochondria (8 mg of protein) were suspended in the 1 ml of lysis buffer containing 2% (w/v) digitonin (Invitrogen), 50 mm potassium acetate, 10% glycerol, 1:50 volume Protease Inhibitor mixture set III (Calbiochem), 1.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 30 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.4) for 1 h at 4 °C with gentle shaking. After incubation the lysate was centrifuged at 4 °C for 20 min at 45,000 rpm (TLA55 rotor), and the supernatant was incubated with 1 μl of TBS-equilibrated magnetized Cobalt Beads (Dynabeads TALON catalogue 101.02D, Invitrogen) per 2.2 μl of lysate to remove FoF1-ATPase. Incubation of 1 ml of lysate with magnetic beads was performed for 45 min at 4 °C with constant shaking. After incubation the beads were removed using a magnetic separator. The supernatant (1 ml) was immediately transferred to an 8 ml sucrose gradient (0.75 m to 1.5 m sucrose in 15 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.2), 20 mm KCl, and 0.4% digitonin) and centrifuged at 4 °C for 20 h at 30,000 rpm (TLS-55 swinging bucket rotor). Fractions (80–100 μl) from the gradient were analyzed by Blue Native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (BN-PAGE) and Western blotting. Aliquots of fractions obtained after sucrose gradient centrifugation were subjected to BN-PAGE in a 3–12% acrylamide gradient gel in Bis-Tris buffer (Invitrogen) according to manufacturer's instructions. After electrophoresis gels were either stained with Bio-Safe Coomassie G-250 (Bio-Rad) or used for Western blotting analysis as we described earlier (28Zhang M. Su X. Mileykovskaya E. Amoscato A.A.

Trumpower, Dartmouth University, Hanover, NH) to the Qcr7 subunit of complex III and secondary anti-mouse antibody (Stabilized Peroxidase Conjugate, Goat anti-mouse, Thermo Fisher). SuperSignal Western Femto Sensitivity kit was used to develop the signal, which was captured using a Fluro-S Max multi imager (29Bogdanov M. Xie J. Heacock P. Dowhan W.

For Western blotting with primary antibody against yeast cytochrome c (generous gift of Dr. Alexander Tzagoloff, Columbia University, New York, NY) followed by goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Stabilized Peroxidase Conjugate, goat anti-rabbit, Thermo Fisher), the purified supercomplex was separated by NuPAGE in a 4–12% acrylamide gradient gel in Bis-Tris buffer with NuPAGE MES SDS Running buffer (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Protein concentrations were determined using the BCA protein assay kit (Thermo Scientific) according to manufacturer's instructions. Respiratory activity of the purified supercomplex III2IV2 was measured using a Clark oxygen electrode as KCN-sensitive oxygen consumption with NaBH4-reduced decylubiquinone (Sigma), QH2, as substrate at 30 °C. Rates were determined from the slope of a plot of O2 concentration versus time. Supercomplex purified in the sucrose gradient (about 55 μg of protein) was incubated in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.0, 100 mm KCl, 0.13 m sucrose, 0.05% digitonin in a final volume of 3 ml. QH2 (40 μm) was added to start the reaction, and oxygen consumption was stopped by addition of 50 μm KCN. Phospholipids were extracted from the supercomplex and mitoplasts (∼20 μg of protein) with a mixture of methanol:chloroform:0.1 n HCl (containing 11 mm ammonium acetate) in a proportion of 1:1:0.9. Samples were vortexed for 1 min and centrifuged at 3000 × g. The organic layer was transferred to a glass tube and dried under a stream of N2.

For quantification of CL using mass spectrometry, 0.8 nmol of 1,1′, 2,2′-tetramyristoyl cardiolipin (CL (14:0)4) (Avanti Polar Lipids, Alabaster, AL) was added as an internal standard prior to extraction of lipids. ESI-MS was performed as previously described (30Sparagna G.C. Johnson C.A. McCune S.A. Moore R.L. Murphy R.C. Quantitation of cardiolipin molecular species in spontaneously hypertensive heart failure rats using electrospray ionization mass spectrometry.J. Lipid Res. 2005; 46: 1196-1204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Samples for CL quantitation were injected into a normal-phase HPLC column (Luna 5 μm silica 100 Å, 2.0 × 150 mm column; Phenomenex) coupled to an API 3200 mass spectrometer running in negative ion mode. Negative ion ESI was carried out at −4,000 V, with declustering potential of −100 V, focusing potential of −350 V, and entrance potential of −10 V. The solvent system consisted of hexane:isopropanol:20 mm ammonium acetate in water, pH 5.5, in a ratio of 30:40:7 (v/v/v) for solvent A and hexane:isopropanol (30:40, v/v) for solvent B. In separate runs 0.34, 0.69 or 1.37 nmol of CL containing four oleic acids (CL (18:1)4) (Avanti Polar Lipids, Alabaster, AL) as a reference and 0.8 nmol of CL ((14:1)4) as an internal standard were used to establish the standard curve. There was a linear relationship between the ratio of the negative molecular ion ([M-H]−) current from CL (18:1)4 (reference standard), and the [M-H]− from the internal standard, CL (14:0)4, as a function of the concentration of CL (18:1)4. The nmol of individual molecular species of CL in analyzed samples of the supercomplex or mitoplasts were calculated by determining the ratio of the peak area of the CL molecular species of interest to the internal standard. This ratio, along with the slope and intercept of the standard curve made with reference standard CL (18:1)4 was used to calculate nmol of CL as described in (30Sparagna G.C. Johnson C.A. McCune S.A. Moore R.L. Murphy R.C. Quantitation of cardiolipin molecular species in spontaneously hypertensive heart failure rats using electrospray ionization mass spectrometry.J. Lipid Res. 2005; 46: 1196-1204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Total CL was determined as the sum of the most prevalent CL species. The value in nmol per mg of protein subjected to extraction was calculated. This number represents the number of CL molecules per mol of the supercomplex since 1 nmol of the supercomplex III2IV2 is about 1 mg. Selected fractions containing the purified supercomplex III2IV2, were combined and used for cryo-EM. Samples were diluted 1:9 in 15 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, and 20 mm KCl buffer to reduce digitonin and sucrose concentrations and deposited on freshly glow discharged (2 min) Quantifoil holey carbon grids (West Chester, PA). Prior to glow discharge, the holey carbon grids were coated with a continuous thin carbon film that was prepared by evaporating carbon on a freshly cleaved mica sheet from a graphite rod using a Denton Vacuum DU-502A Evaporator. Grids were rapidly frozen in liquid ethane using a home made gravity-driven plunger apparatus. Cryo-frozen samples were imaged at liquid nitrogen temperature using a Polara 300 kV electron microscope (FEI Company) using a 4K × 4K CCD camera (TVIPS GmbH, Gauting, Germany). Images were recorded at low dose conditions at 3 to 7 μm underfocus and a ×39,000 nominal magnification. All image processing steps were done using the SPARX software package (31Hohn M. Tang G. Goodyear G. Baldwin P.R. Huang Z. Penczek P.A. Yang C. Glaeser R.M. Adams P.D. Ludtke S.J. SPARX, a new environment for Cryo-EM image processing.J. Struct.

From 200 micrographs a total of 23,715 particles were manually selected and windowed using e2boxer.py with a pixel size of 4.58 Å on the specimen scale. Class averages were calculated using the Iterative Stable Alignment and Clustering (ISAC) program, from which 252 averages were produced (32Yang Z. Fang J. Chittuluru J. Asturias F. Penczek P. Iterative stable alignment and clustering of 2D transmission electron microscope images.Structure. 2012; 8: 237-247Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (183) Google Scholar). By visual inspection, we selected from this set a subset of 230 plausible views of the supercomplex III2IV2. An initial model was calculated with the three-dimensional projection matching method using the selected class averages and starting from a template structure constructed using the electron density map obtained from the atomic model of S. cerevisiae complex III (PDB accession number 1KYO) embedded in an oblate spheroid (lens-shape) representing the undefined position of two complexes IV in the supercomplex (see Fig. 1). Prior to conversion to an electron density map, the PDB file of the yeast cytochrome bc1 complex (complex III) was modified by removing chains j, u, k, v, and w. Subsequently, individual projection image-based three-dimensional projection alignment was carried out with enforcement of C2 symmetry of the structure and starting from the model obtained from class averages. Finally, images whose projection directions (as determined by the refinement) were over-represented were removed to obtain a subset of 7,824 images with approximately evenly distributed projection directions and the refinement was continued until we obtained a stable three-dimensional structure at a resolution of 24 Å, as determined by the FSC @ 0.5 test (33Saxton W.O. Baumeister W. The correlation averaging of a regularly arranged bacterial cell envelope protein.J. Microsc. 1982; 127: 127-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar). During the refinement the power spectrum of the structure was adjusted to match that of the electron density map calculated fr"

In the skin, collagen I fibrils are the major structural component of the dermal ECM, decorated by proteoglycans and by fibril-associated collagens with interrupted triple helices such as collagens XII and XIV. Here we show that the cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP), an abundant component of cartilage ECM, is expressed in healthy human skin. COMP expression is detected in the dermal compartment of skin and in cultured fibroblasts, whereas epidermis and HaCaT cells are negative. In addition to binding collagen I, COMP binds to collagens XII and XIV via their C-terminal collagenous domains. All three proteins codistribute in a characteristic narrow zone in the superficial papillary dermis of healthy human skin. Ultrastructural analysis by immunogold labeling confirmed colocalization and further revealed the presence of COMP along with collagens XII and XIV in anchoring plaques. On the basis of these observations, we postulate that COMP functions as an adapter protein in human skin, similar to its function in cartilage ECM, by organizing collagen I fibrils into a suprastructure, mainly in the vicinity of anchoring plaques that stabilize the cohesion between the upper dermis and the basement membrane zone.Background: What is the biological function of COMP in skin ECM?Results: COMP binds collagens XII and XIV that associate with collagen I fibrils.

Connective tissues possess specific structural and functional properties that are largely determined by the supramolecular arrangement of the collagen network and its interactions with surrounding ECM 3The abbreviations used are: ECMextracellular matrixFACITfibril-associated collagens with interrupted triple helicesCOMPcartilage oligomeric matrix proteinSFMserum-free medium. proteins. To date, 28 different types of collagens are known that are categorized in eight subfamilies on the basis of their function, assembly, and domain homology (1Kadler K.E. Baldock C. Bella J.

Collagens, modifying enzymes and their mutations in humans, flies and worms.Trends Genet. 2004; 20: 33-43Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (882) Google Scholar). Among these, fibrillar collagens form the major component of the ECM in connective tissues. Examples are collagen I, which is abundant in skin, bone, tendon and ligament, and collagen II, predominantly expressed in cartilage. extracellular matrix fibril-associated collagens with interrupted triple helices cartilage oligomeric matrix protein serum-free medium. In skin, the arrangement of the collagen network varies considerably with anatomical location. In the reticular (deeper) dermis, well ordered thick collagen fibrils predominate, whereas in the papillary (upper) dermis underlying the epidermis and basement membrane, the collagen network is less rigid with a loose connective tissue and a distinct organization of collagen fibrils (3Sorrell J.M. Caplan A.I. Fibroblast heterogeneity. More than skin deep.J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 667-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). The supramolecular organization of collagen fibrils is critical for tissue integrity, biomechanical stability, and function. Collagen fibril networks are stabilized by their interaction with proteoglycans and with other collagenous and non-collagenous proteins. A large number of non-collagenous ECM components have been implicated in regulating collagen fibrillogenesis, including small leucine-rich repeat proteoglycans like decorin, fibromodulin, and lumican. Fibromodulin accelerates lateral growth of collagen I fibrils, thus enhancing fibril thickness (4Ezura Y. Chakravarti S. Oldberg A. Chervoneva I. Birk D.E. Differential expression of lumican and fibromodulin regulate collagen fibrillogenesis in developing mouse tendons.J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 779-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Decorin and lumican interfere with orderly lateral assembly of collagen molecules and, thus, retard fibril growth (5Danielson K.G. Baribault H. Holmes D.F. Graham H. Kadler K.E. Iozzo R.V. Targeted disruption of decorin leads to abnormal collagen fibril morphology and skin fragility.J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 729-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (1179) Google Scholar, 6Rada J.A. Cornuet P.K.

Eye Res. 1993; 56: 635-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Collagens themselves also regulate the formation of collagen I fibrils and fiber bundles either by directly binding the fibrillar collagens or by binding adapter molecules. Collagen III is associated with thinner collagen I fibrils in tendons (7Birk D.E. Mayne R. Localization of collagen types I, III and V during tendon development. Changes in collagen types I and III are correlated with changes in fibril diameter.Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 72: 352-361PubMed Google Scholar), and collagen XI has been reported to inhibit lateral growth of collagen II fibrils in cartilage (8Blaschke U.K. Eikenberry E.F. Hulmes D.J. Galla H.J. Bruckner P. Collagen XI nucleates self-assembly and limits lateral growth of cartilage fibrils.J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10370-10378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Fibril-associated collagens with interrupted triple helices (FACIT), such as collagen IX, inhibit lateral growth of cartilage collagen fibrils (9Wotton S.F. Duance V.C. Fryer P.R. Type IX collagen. A possible function in articular cartilage.FEBS Lett. 1988; 234: 79-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Collagens XII and XIV are also classified as FACIT collagens on the basis of their structural organization (10Shaw L.M. Olsen B.R. FACIT collagens: diverse molecular bridges in extracellular matrices.Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 191-194Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Collagen XIV binds to banded collagen I fibrils, and characterization of collagen XIV-deficient mouse tendons showed a shift toward larger-diameter fibrils (11Ansorge H.L. Meng X. Zhang G. Veit G. Sun M. Klement J.F. Beason D.P. Soslowsky L.J. Koch M. Birk D.E. Type XIV collagen regulates fibrillogenesis: Premature collagen fibril growth and tissue dysfunction in null mice.J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 8427-8438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Immunoelectron microscopy revealed that collagen XII associated with collagen I fibrils in calf, chick, and human tendons and skin and, by analogy, collagen XII has been proposed to serve similar functions as collagen XIV in connective tissues enriched in collagen I (12Keene D.R. Lunstrum G.P. Morris N.P. Stoddard D.W. Burgeson R.E. Two type XII-like collagens localize to the surface of banded collagen fibrils.J. Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 971-978Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 13Koch M. Bohrmann B. Matthison M. Hagios C. Trueb B. Chiquet M. Large and small splice variants of collagen XII. Differential expression and ligand binding.J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 1005-1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Structurally, both collagen XII and XIV are comprised by two collagenous domains (Col1 and Col2) separated by two short non-collagenous domains (NC1 and NC2) at the C terminus and a very large N-terminal non-collagenous NC3 domain (Fig. 1A). Collagen XII interacts with various other ECM proteins like decorin, tenascin-X, and fibromodulin via distinct or overlapping domains. For example, binding to avian tenascin-X occurs via its non-collagenous N-terminal NC3 domain (14Veit G. Hansen U. Keene D.R. Bruckner P. Chiquet-Ehrismann R. Chiquet M. Koch M. Collagen XII interacts with avian tenascin-X through its NC3 domain.J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 27461-27470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), whereas decorin-binding is independent of the NC3 domain (15Font B. Eichenberger D. Rosenberg L.M. van der Rest M. Characterization of the interactions of type XII collagen with two small proteoglycans from fetal bovine tendon, decorin and fibromodulin.Matrix Biol. 1996; 15: 341-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Two collagen XII variants arise by alternative splicing and differ by N-terminal domains present exclusively in the large splice variant (Fig. 1A). This contributes a heparin binding site not present in the short splice variant. Thus, the two variants of collagen XII display differential ligand binding properties (13Koch M. Bohrmann B. Matthison M. Hagios C. Trueb B. Chiquet M. Large and small splice variants of collagen XII. Differential expression and ligand binding.J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 1005-1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). In addition to structural similarities, collagen XIV also shows functional homologies to collagen XII by binding to decorin (16Font B. Aubert-Foucher E. Goldschmidt D. Eichenberger D. van der Rest M. Binding of collagen XIV with the dermatan sulfate side chain of decorin.J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25015-25018Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), tenascin-X (17Lethias C. Carisey A.

However, the two proteins display different expression patterns, especially during development (19Wälchli C. Koch M. Chiquet M. Odermatt B.F. Trueb B.

In cartilage ECM, one of the pivotal proteins involved in bridging the collagen II fibril network and other cartilage components is COMP, the fifth member of the thrombospondin family (20Hedbom E.

On the basis of the analogy to collagen II in cartilage, in this study we investigated whether COMP may function as an organizer of the dermal collagen I network in the skin and, if so, whether binding to the FACIT collagens XII and XIV is involved, representing molecules that decorate the major collagen I fibrils present in skin ECM. We report in vitro binding between COMP and collagens XII and XIV and colocalization of these proteins in vivo. Interestingly, the proteins also codistribute at the ultrastructural level in healthy human skin, mainly in a characteristic band-like pattern in the topmost papillary dermis adjacent to anchoring plaques in close vicinity to keratinocytes and fibroblasts. For cloning of collagen XII (mCol12a1, accession no. NM_007730.2), first the Ct-XII fragment (Fig. 1A) was amplified from embryonic day 15.5 mouse embryo cDNA using the primer pairs P3/P8 (see list of PCR primers in supplemental Table S1). The PCR product was ligated (rapid DNA ligation kit, Roche) into a pBK II vector for sequencing, followed by cloning into a modified pCEP-Pu vector carrying a 3′ His8 tag (44Koch M. Schulze J. Hansen U. Ashwodt T. Keene D.R. Brunken W.J. Burgeson R.E. Bruckner P. Bruckner-Tuderman L. A novel marker of tissue junctions, collagen XXII.J. Biol.

The collagen ssv-XII was generated by cloning two additional fragments using primer pairs M854/M893 (N-terminal) and P143/P144 (middle). Both fragments were ligated into a pBK II vector for sequencing. The Ct-XII as well as the N-terminal ssv-XII fragments were digested with herculase (Stratagene) to generate blunt ends. The ssv-XII was created by digestion of the N-terminal fragment with BspEI, the middle fragment with NdeI and BspEI, and the blunt end Ct-XII with NdeI, which were ligated in that order. The resulting ssv-XII was cloned via the restriction sites NheI and Psp XI into a modified pCEP-Pu vector containing a 5′ 2× StrepII tag (45Gara S.K. Grumati P. Urciuolo A. Bonaldo P. Kobbe B.

For cloning the collagen lsv-XII, an N-terminal fragment was amplified using the primers P145/P146 and cloned into a pBK II vector for sequencing. The previously cloned ssv-XII was digested with NheI and Nsi I to remove its N-terminal part and replace it with the de novo N-terminal fragment for lsv-XII via the Nsi I site. The resulting lsv-XII was cloned via NheI and Psp XI into a modified pCEP-Pu vector containing a 5′ 2× StrepII tag. The Nt-XII and mid-XII fragments were amplified with the primer pairs P145/T374 and T375/T376 using the lsv-XII cDNA as a template and cloned into the same pCEP-Pu vector as the full-length collagens. Cloning of full-length collagen XIV (mCol14a1, accession no. NM_181277.3) was carried out by amplifying the Ct-XIV and an N-terminal fragment with the primer pairs P18/P19 and M850/P148 and ligation of the amplified product into a pBK II vector. Both fragments were fused via the internal restriction site Sbf I and cloned into a modified pCEP-Pu vector containing a 5′ 2× StrepII-tag. For the Nt-XIV fragment the primers M850/T377 were used, and the fragment was cloned via the pBK II vector for sequencing into the pCEP-Pu vector with a 5′ 2× StrepII-tag. The Ct-XIV fragment was cloned into a modified pCEP-Pu vector harboring a 5′ His8 tag. COMP (mCOMP, accession no. NM_016685.2) was amplified with the primer pair P987/P988 and cloned into a modified pCEP-Pu vector containing a 5′ 2× StrepII tag. HEK293-EBNA cells (Invitrogen) were stably transfected with all full-length constructs and their fragments as described (46Koch M. Veit G. Stricker S. Bhatt P. Kutsch S. Zhou P. Reinders E. Hahn R.A.

Immunoblotting of all proteins was carried out using supernatants of transfected HEK293-EBNA cells by separating the proteins by SDS-PAGE using 4–12% gradient gels under non-reducing and reducing conditions and transfer onto nitrocellulose. Membranes were blocked in 3% BSA/TBS/0.05% Tween 20 (TBST), incubated with antibodies recognizing the 2× StrepII tag (IBA) or the His8 tag (Qiagen), followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibodies. Proteins were visualized with Immobilon Western chemiluminescent HRP substrate (Millipore). Collected supernatants were supplemented with 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Sigma). Strep-tagged proteins (lsv-XII, ssv-XII, Nt-XII, mid-XII, XIV, Nt-XIV, and COMP) were passed over a streptactin-Sepharose column (IBA) after filtration, and the recombinant proteins were eluted with buffer (100 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl (pH 7.4)) containing 2.5 mm d-desthiobiotin (Sigma) (45Gara S.K.

Supernatants containing His-tagged proteins (Ct-XII and Ct-XIV) were additionally supplemented with 10% 0.5 m Na2HPO4 and, after filtration, passed over a Ni-Sepharose 6 Fast Flow (GE Healthcare) and eluted stepwise with 10–250 mm imidazole in 20 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl (pH 8.0) (46Koch M.

https://openalex.org/W1985054631,"Zebrafish larvae show a robust behavior called rheotaxis, whereby they use their lateral line system to orient upstream in the presence of a steady current. At 5 days post fertilization, rheotactic larvae can detect and initiate a swimming burst away from a continuous point-source of suction. Burst distance and velocity increase when fish initiate bursts closer to the suction source where flow velocity is higher. We suggest that either the magnitude of the burst reflects the initial flow stimulus, or fish may continually sense flow during the burst to determine where to stop. By removing specific neuromasts of the posterior lateral line along the body, we show how the location and number of flow sensors play a role in detecting a continuous suction source. We show that the burst response critically depends on the presence of neuromasts on the tail. Flow information relayed by neuromasts appears to be involved in the selection of appropriate behavioral responses. We hypothesize that caudally located neuromasts may be preferentially connected to fast swimming spinal motor networks while rostrally located neuromasts are connected to slow swimming motor networks at an early age."

B., and Yamauchi, M. (2011) Lysyl hydroxylase 3 glucosylates galactosylhydroxylysine residues in type I collagen in osteoblast culture. J. Biol. Chem. 286, 8846–8856). To further elucidate the biological significance of this modification, we characterized and compared type I collagen phenotypes produced by Sh clones and two control groups, MC and those transfected with empty vector. Mass spectrometric analysis identified five glycosylation sites in type I collagen (i.e. α1,2-87, α1,2-174, and α2-219. Of these, the predominant glycosylation site was α1-87, one of the major helical cross-linking sites. In Sh collagen, the abundance of glucosylgalactosylhydroxylysine was significantly decreased at all of the five sites with a concomitant increase in galactosylhydroxylysine at four of these sites. The collagen cross-links were significantly diminished in Sh clones, and, for the major cross-link, dihydroxylysinonorleucine (DHLNL), glucosylgalactosyl-DHLNL was diminished with a concomitant increase in galactosyl-DHLNL. When subjected to in vitro incubation, in Sh clones, the rate of decrease in DHLNL was lower, whereas the rate of increase in its maturational cross-link, pyridinoline, was comparable with controls. Furthermore, in Sh clones, the mean diameters of collagen fibrils were significantly larger, and the onset of mineralized nodule formation was delayed when compared with those of controls. These results indicate that the LH3-mediated glucosylation occurs at the specific molecular loci in the type I collagen molecule and plays critical roles in controlling collagen cross-linking, fibrillogenesis, and mineralization.Background: Type I collagen is the most abundant organic component in bone, providing form and stability.Results: Lysyl hydroxylase 3-mediated glucosylation occurs at specific sites in collagen, including cross-linking sites, and suppression of this modification results in defective collagen and mineralization.Conclusion: The data indicate the critical importance of this modification in bone physiology.Significance: Alterations of this collagen modification may cause bone defects.

Despite all of the findings regarding collagen glycosylation reported to date, the precise molecular loci, the extent/type of glycosylation, and their biological functions are still not clearly defined. In our recent report (12Sricholpech M. Perdivara I. Nagaoka H. Yokoyama M. Tomer K.B. Yamauchi M. Lysyl hydroxylase 3 glucosylates galactosylhydroxylysine residues in type I collagen in osteoblast culture.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 8846-8856Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), by employing the short hairpin (Sh) RNA technology, we have demonstrated that the major function of LH3 for type I collagen is to transfer glucose units to G-Hyl residues and that alteration in the level of glucosylation significantly affects the kinetics of collagen fibrillogenesis in vitro. In the present study, by using this system, we identified the LH3-mediated glucosylation sites in type I collagen and investigated the potential roles of this modification in type I collagen phenotypes by analyzing cross-linking pattern and maturation, fibrillogenesis, and matrix mineralization. The pSilencer2.1-U6/neo-Plod3 construct encoding the short hairpin sequence targeting Plod3 was generated, and the MC3T3-E1 (MC) cell-derived clones stably suppressing Plod3 (Sh clones) were obtained as described previously (12Sricholpech M. Perdivara I. Nagaoka H. Yokoyama M. Tomer K.B. Yamauchi M. Lysyl hydroxylase 3 glucosylates galactosylhydroxylysine residues in type I collagen in osteoblast culture.J. Biol.

MC cells and those transfected with the original pSilencer2.1-U6/neo plasmid (EV; encoding a hairpin siRNA sequence not found in any genome database) were used as controls. The phenotype of type I collagen synthesized by three Sh clones (Sh1-1, Sh1-2, and Sh1-3) and controls were further characterized in this study. Type I collagen was purified from MC, EV, and Sh clones as reported (12Sricholpech M. Perdivara I. Nagaoka H. Yokoyama M. Tomer K.B. Yamauchi M.

Following staining with Coomassie Simply Blue, the protein bands were excised and subjected to automated in-gel digestion with trypsin overnight at 37 °C, using a Progest robot digester (Genomic Solutions, Harbor, MI). The samples were lyophilized and stored at −80 °C until further use. The collagen proteolytic mixtures were analyzed by LC-MS on a Waters-Micromass Q-Tof Premier hybrid tandem mass spectrometer equipped with a nanoAcquity UPLC system (Waters, Milford, MA). The lyophilized tryptic digests were reconstituted in 30–40 μl of 0.1% formic acid in deionized water. Analyses were performed on a 1.7-μm, 100 μm × 100-mm, BEH dC18 column (Waters, Milford, MA), using a flow rate of 300 nl/min. A C18 trapping column (180 μm × 20 mm) with a 5-μm particle size (Waters, Milford, MA) was positioned in-line of the analytical column and upstream of a micro-tee union used both as a vent for trapping and as a liquid junction. Trapping was performed for 3 min at a 5 μl/min flow rate, using the initial solvent composition. A 3-μl aliquot of the digest sample was injected onto the column. Peptides were eluted by using a linear gradient from 98% solvent A (0.1% formic acid in water (v/v)) and 2% solvent B (0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile (v/v)) to 40% solvent B over 90 min. Instrument settings for the MS analysis were as follows: capillary voltage of 3.2 kV, cone voltage of 20 V, collision energy of 6.0 V, and source temperature of 80 °C. Mass spectra were acquired over the mass range 200–2000 Da. For calibration, an orthogonal reference spray (LockSpray) of a solution of Glu1-Fibrinopeptide B (500 fmol/μl) in water/acetonitrile (80:20, v/v) and 0.1% formic acid, having a reference mass of 785.8496 (2+) was used. In order to identify glycosylation sites in type I collagen, LC-tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) analyses with data-dependent acquisition of the four most abundant ions was employed. A collision energy ramp from 30 to 40 V was employed. To determine the relative levels of Lys, Hyl, G-Hyl, and GG-Hyl for each observed glycosylation site, triplicate LC-MS analyses were acquired. LC-nanoChip-ESI ion trap MS analyses were performed using an Agilent 6340 XCT Ultra Ion Trap (Santa Clara, CA) equipped with an HPLC Chip Cube MS interface, an Agilent 1100/1200 nanoHPLC System, and an electron transfer dissociation module. Ion trap-MS/MS analyses were performed as follows. 20-μl injections of the tryptic digests dissolved in 0.1% formic acid were loaded onto a 40-nl enrichment column followed by a 43 mm × 75-μm analytical column, packed with ZORBAX 300SB C18 particles (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA). Linear gradients of 3–50% (0.1% formic acid) were performed over 50 min at a flow rate of 500 nl/min. The parameter settings for positive ion ESI-MS were as follows: capillary voltage, 2000 V; end plate offset, 500 V; capillary exit, 180 V; nebulizer, 2 p.s.i., dry gas, 4 liters/min; dry gas temperature, 325 °C. For MS/MS, electron transfer dissociation (ETD) or collision-induced dissociation, automated data-dependent acquisitions of the six most abundant ions were employed. For collision-induced dissociation, the fragmentation amplitude was 0.80 V. For ETD analyses, the accumulation time of the fluoranthene gas was 40 ms, and the reaction time was typically 100 or 150 ms. The LC-MS/MS and LC-MS data were visualized with the MassLynx software, version 4.1 (Waters, Milford, MA). Tryptic peptides containing Lys residues and their hydroxylated and/or glycosylated forms were identified from the LC-MS/MS analyses of tryptic digests using manual interpretation of the MS/MS spectra. Relative quantitation of Lys, Hyl, G-Hyl, and GG-Hyl at a particular glycosylation site was performed by dividing the total ion abundance determined for each species by the sum of the ion abundances of all observed species containing that particular site. For example, the ion abundance for G-Hyl was determined by summing up the ion abundances determined for each observed charge state of the multiply protonated glycopeptide ion over the chromatographic elution time of the G-Hyl glycopeptide. For those instances where a modified site was observed as both enzymatically fully processed and as peptides containing one miscleavage, both species were considered in the determination of the ion abundance of that modification. The tryptic peptides and the observed modifications considered for relative quantitation are summarized in supplemental Table 1. MC, EV, and Sh clones were plated at a density of 2 × 105 cells/35-mm dish. After 48 h of culture, total RNA was extracted with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen), and 2 μg of total RNA was converted into cDNA by using the Omniscript Reverse Transcriptase kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Quantitative real-time PCR was performed using the sequence-specific primer for lysyl oxidase (LOX) (Lox; ABI assay number: Mm00495386_m1), LOXL (Loxl; Mm01145738_m1), LOXL2 (Loxl2; Mm00804740_m1), LOXL3 (Loxl3; Mm00442953_m1), LOXL4 (Loxl4; Mm00446385_m1). The reactions were prepared and analyzed in triplicates by the ABI Prism 7000 Sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems, Foster city, CA). The mRNA expression level of LH3 relative to glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH; ABI assay number 4308313) was analyzed by the 2−ΔΔCT method (46Livak K.J. Schmittgen T.D. Analysis of relative gene expression data using real-time quantitative PCR and the 2−ΔΔCT method.Methods. 2001; 25: 402-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (123392) Google Scholar). MC, Sh (Sh1-1, Sh1-2, and Sh1-3) and EV clones were cultured in α-minimum essential medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Invitrogen) and 50 μg/ml ascorbic acid. After 2 weeks of culture, cells/matrices were scraped, thoroughly washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and cold deionized distilled water, and lyophilized. The samples were prepared for collagen cross-link analysis as described previously (47Yamauchi M. Shiiba M. Lysine hydroxylation and cross-linking of collagen.Methods Mol. Biol. 2008; 446: 95-108Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, ∼2 mg of dried samples was suspended in 0.15 m N-trismethyl-2-aminoethanesulfonic acid and 0.05 m Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.4) and reduced with standardized NaB3H4."
https://openalex.org/W2090176789,"TGF-β1 can regulate osteoblast differentiation not only positively but also negatively. However, the mechanisms of negative regulation are not well understood. We previously established the reproducible model for studying the suppression of osteoblast differentiation by repeated or high dose treatment with TGF-β1, although single low dose TGF-β1 strongly induced osteoblast differentiation. The mRNA expression and protein level of insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) were remarkably decreased by repeated TGF-β1 administration in human periodontal ligament cells, human mesenchymal stem cells, and murine preosteoblast MC3T3-E1 cells. Repeated TGF-β1 administration subsequently decreased alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity and mRNA expression of osteoblast differentiation marker genes, such as RUNX2, ALP, and bone sialoprotein (BSP). Additionally, repeated administration significantly reduced the downstream signaling pathway of IGF-1, such as Akt phosphorylation in these cells. Surprisingly, exogenous and overexpressed IGF-1 recovered ALP activity and mRNA expression of osteoblast differentiation marker genes even with repeated TGF-β1 administration. These facts indicate that the key mechanism of inhibition of osteoblast differentiation induced by repeated TGF-β1 treatment is simply due to the down-regulation of IGF-1 expression. Inhibition of IGF-1 signaling using small interfering RNA (siRNA) against insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) suppressed mRNA expression of RUNX2, ALP, BSP, and IGF-1 even with single TGF-β1 administration. This study showed that persistence of TGF-β1 inhibited osteoblast differentiation via suppression of IGF-1 expression and subsequent down-regulation of the PI3K/Akt pathway. We think this fact could open the way to use IGF-1 as a treatment tool for bone regeneration in prolonged inflammatory disease."

In this report, we therefore examined the fate of the excised oligonucleotides during nucleotide excision repair both with mammalian cell-free extracts and with purified human excision repair factors. Surprisingly, we find that the excised oligonucleotide is released in a complex with the transcription/repair factor TFIIH and that it dissociates from TFIIH in an ATP-dependent manner at a very slow rate, ultimately becoming targeted by cellular nucleases and/or bound by RPA. These results clarify an important step in the mechanism of excision repair and raise the possibility that the canonical 30-nt excision product may be involved as a signal for coordinating cellular responses to DNA damage. Internally 32P-labeled DNA substrate (140 bp) containing a single (6-4) UV photoproduct was prepared by annealing and ligating six oligonucleotides, as previously described (20Reardon J.T. Sancar A. Purification and characterization of Escherichia coli and human nucleotide excision repair enzyme systems.Methods Enzymol. 2006; 408: 189-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The oligonucleotide containing the (6-4) photoproduct was prepared by the Synthetic Organic Chemistry Core at the University of Texas Medical Branch (Galveston, TX) and subsequently radiolabeled with [γ-32P]ATP and polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs). In experiments with biotinylated substrate immobilized on Dynabeads M-280 streptavidin (Invitrogen), a 5′-biotinylated oligonucleotide was used in place of the corresponding nonbiotinylated oligomer of identical sequence. Immobilization of the DNA was done according to the manufacturer's recommendations (Invitrogen). Sequences of the oligonucleotides are available upon request. Standard excision assays involved incubation of 12.5 fmol of substrate in a 25-μl reaction containing 3 mg/ml CHO (AA8) or HeLa cell-free extract (CFE), 2 mm ATP, and 50 nm recombinant human RPA, in a final buffer containing 23 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.9), 44 mm KCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 2.5% glycerol, 0.04 mm EDTA, and 0.2 mm DTT. CHO and HeLa CFEs were prepared as described (20Reardon J.T. Sancar A. Purification and characterization of Escherichia coli and human nucleotide excision repair enzyme systems.Methods Enzymol. 2006; 408: 189-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Mock and RPA-depleted HeLa CFE was prepared by incubating 150 μg of HeLa CFE three times for 1 h at 4 °C with either 10 μg of normal mouse IgG (Santa Cruz sc-2025) or anti-RPA34 antibody (Calbiochem NA18) bound to recombinant protein A/G PLUS-agarose (Santa Cruz). Recombinant RPA was expressed in BL21 (DE3) cells and purified as described (21Henricksen L.A. Umbricht C.B. Wold M.S. Recombinant replication protein A.

Excision assays with the core excision repair factors (XPA, XPC, XPF-ERCC1, XPG, TFIIH, and RPA) were performed using standard approaches (20Reardon J.T. Sancar A. Purification and characterization of Escherichia coli and human nucleotide excision repair enzyme systems.Methods Enzymol. 2006; 408: 189-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). At the indicated time points, the excision reactions were stopped by addition of SDS (0.34%) and proteinase K (20 μg). After incubation at 50–60 °C for 20 min, excision products were purified by phenol-chloroform extraction and then precipitated in ethanol. Excision products were separated on urea-containing DNA sequencing gels and then detected with a PhosphorImager. Radiolabeled oligonucleotides of known length were resolved on all gels as size markers. Excision repair activity was quantified using ImageQuant 5.2 software (GE Healthcare) by dividing the signal intensity from the small ∼30-mer products by the total signal from both the full-length substrate and ∼30-mer products. Excision reactions or purified excision products were loaded onto a 24-ml Superdex 200 gel filtration column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated in Buffer A (25 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.9, 100 mm KCl, 12.5% glycerol, 12 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, and 0.02% Nonidet P-40). Fractions (0.75–1.0 ml, depending on the experiment) were collected and either first deproteinized with proteinase K and phenol-chloroform extraction or directly precipitated in ethanol. Protein standards (ferritin, aldolase, and ovalbumin) were used as molecular size markers to calibrate the column. Excision reactions (typically 25 μl) were diluted 4-fold with 100 μl of cold buffer B (25 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.9, 100 mm KCl, 12.5% glycerol, 12 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, and 0.1% Nonidet P-40) after adding the appropriate antibody (typically 0.5–2 μg) to the reaction. The reactions were rotated for 1–2 h at 4 °C and then incubated for 1 h with 15 μl of recombinant protein A/G PLUS-agarose (Santa Cruz). After washing twice with 0.5 ml of buffer B, immunoprecipitates (IPs) were either eluted with 100 mm glycine (pH 2.7) and then neutralized with 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.8) or were deproteinized by incubation with SDS and proteinase K as described above. Antibodies used for immunoprecipitation included anti-mouse IgG (sc-2025), anti-rabbit IgG (sc-2027), anti-XPB (sc-293), anti-XPA (sc-28353), anti-p62 (sc-292), and anti-XPC (sc-74410) from Santa Cruz and anti-RPA34 (NA18) from Calbiochem. Assays measuring the release of excision products from TFIIH were performed by first immunoprecipitating TFIIH from a 60-min, 100-μl excision reaction with CHO CFE and immobilized, radiolabeled substrate DNA. After washing the immunoprecipitate three times with 0.5 ml of cold buffer B and once with cold buffer C (30 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.9, 40 mm KCl, 3.2 mm MgCl2), immunoprecipitates were resuspended in buffer C. ATP and analogs were added to a final concentration of 2 mm, as indicated. RPA was added at 50 nm, as indicated. Immunoprecipitates were dispensed into 50-μl aliquots and then incubated at 30 °C for the indicated lengths of time. The reactions were centrifuged (3000 × g for 30 s) to separate the unbound, released material from the bead-bound immunoprecipitate. After deproteinization, phenol-chloroform extraction, and ethanol precipitation, purified DNAs were resolved on denaturing gels. The percentage of excision product released from TFIIH was quantified by dividing the excision product signal from the unbound fraction by the total excision product signal in the unbound and unbound fractions. Proteins in CFE, excision reactions, and immunoprecipitates were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to Hybond ECL membranes (GE Healthcare). Immunoblot detection of most of the proteins involved the use of the same antibody that was used for IP. RPA and XPA were detected with antibodies from Bethyl (A300–241A) and Santa Cruz (sc-853), respectively. Chemiluminescent detection of proteins was done with either Western blotting luminol reagent (sc-2048; Santa Cruz) or ECL Prime reagent (GE Healthcare). To examine the fate of the canonical ∼30-nt excision product generated by mammalian nucleotide excision repair, we prepared a (6-4) photoproduct-containing DNA substrate and incubated it with CHO cell-free extract that is known to possess robust excision nuclease activity (20Reardon J.T. Sancar A. Purification and characterization of Escherichia coli and human nucleotide excision repair enzyme systems.Methods Enzymol. 2006; 408: 189-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1A, within 15 min a significant amount of 30-nt excision product (24–32 nt) was detectable. Excision products continued to accumulate until ∼2 h, at which point (∼40% of the photoproduct excised) the rate of excision declines (Fig. 1B) and the size of the excision products begins to decrease by several nucleotides (Fig. 1A, compare lanes 3 and 5). These results are in close agreement with earlier reports on degradation of the ∼30-nt excision product in HeLa cell-free extracts (3Svoboda D.L. Taylor J.S. Hearst J.E. Sancar A. DNA repair by eukaryotic nucleotide excision nuclease. Removal of thymine dimer and psoralen monoadduct by HeLa cell-free extract and of thymine dimer by Xenopus laevis oocytes.J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1931-1936Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and Xenopus oocytes (2Huang J.C. Sancar A. Determination of minimum substrate size for human excinuclease.J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19034-19040Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although the nucleases that are responsible for degrading the excised oligonucleotide are not known, the change in size distribution of the excised oligonucleotides as a function of reaction time was striking. Further analysis of this phenomenon revealed that at early time points, the peak excision product size was ∼26–28 nt, and at later time points this size decreased to 19–20 nt (Fig. 1C). We considered that this ∼20-nt degradation product could be primarily due to a 3′ to 5′ nuclease that digests the 4–8 nt located 3′ to the (6-4) photoproduct of the canonical 24–32-nt excision product and then stalls at the adducted base. However, when we incubated a 5′-labeled, damage-free 27-mer single-stranded oligonucleotide in CHO cell-free extract, we similarly observed an intermediate ∼20 nt in length that was apparently protected from nuclease digestion at the 3′ end of the oligonucleotide (supplemental Fig. S1). Thus, we conclude that the 19–20-nt oligonucleotides generated at later time points in excision reactions with a (6-4) photoproduct-containing substrate are not unique to single-stranded DNAs containing base adducts. These results further suggest that one or more cellular proteins may limit the degradation of the single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) excision product in cell-free extract. Using gel mobility shift assay (8Mu D. Park C.H. Matsunaga T. Hsu D.S. Reardon J.T. Sancar A. Reconstitution of human DNA repair excision nuclease in a highly defined system.J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2415-2418Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar) or DNA pull-down assay (23Mu D. Wakasugi M. Hsu D.S. Sancar A. Characterization of reaction intermediates of human excision repair nuclease.J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28971-28979Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) to analyze the fate of the canonical 30-mer excision product, it was reported that the oligomer was released in a complex with a protein or was bound to a protein with high affinity for ssDNA shortly after release. However, a later study (24Riedl T. Hanaoka F. Egly J.M. The comings and goings of nucleotide excision repair factors on damaged DNA.EMBO J. 2003; 22: 5293-5303Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar) employing gel filtration chromatography and an alternative method to detect the ∼30-nt excision product concluded that the excision product was not associated with any of the six core repair factors. To reconcile these conflicting conclusions regarding the status of the canonical 30-mer, we performed an excision reaction with CHO cell-free extract and the (6-4) photoproduct substrate and analyzed the reaction products by gel filtration chromatography. When the DNA was isolated by proteinase K digestion followed by phenol-chloroform extraction, the unrepaired DNA eluted at a position corresponding to a molecular mass of ∼200 kDa, consistent with the calculated molecular mass of a duplex of 140 bp (Fig. 2A), whereas the excision products mainly eluted in the included volume consistent with the predicted molecular mass of ∼10 kDa. When the reaction mixture was separated by gel filtration without further processing, the 140-bp substrate and the excision product were again separated; however, under this condition the unprocessed substrate was mostly in the void volume, consistent with its being associated with repair factors in preincision complexes and/or being bound nonspecifically to DNA-binding proteins present in whole cell-free extract. Importantly, the 30-mer eluted at positions corresponding to molecular masses of 150 kDa to greater than 400 kDa, consistent with the notion that the excision product is released either bound to one or more of the six repair factors (all 6 of which have DNA binding activity) or was bound to a repair factor or another DNA-binding protein present in the cell extract after release from the gapped duplex (Fig. 2, B and C). To differentiate between these two mechanisms, we performed the experiments described below. In a previous study in which the canonical 30-mer was detected in DNA-protein complexes (23Mu D. Wakasugi M. Hsu D.S. Sancar A. Characterization of reaction intermediates of human excision repair nuclease.J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28971-28979Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), it was speculated that the protein component might be XPC based on high affinity of this protein to ssDNA. To identify the protein(s) bound to the excised oligonucleotide, we performed an excision reaction with cell-free extract and then immunoprecipitated the various repair factors from the reaction with specific antibodies. As shown in Fig. 3A, we were able to efficiently immunoprecipitate RPA, XPA, XPC, and TFIIH (p62 and XPB) from the excision reaction. Importantly, under our reaction conditions each of the immunoprecipitates was free of the other excision repair proteins. It should be noted that because p62 and XPB are components of the multisubunit transcription/repair factor TFIIH, XPB was immunoprecipitated with both anti-p62 and anti-XPB antibodies. When we analyzed the immunoprecipitates for DNA content, we observed that the canonical 30-mer was associated with only two factors, RPA and TFIIH (Fig. 3A). RPA is the major single-stranded DNA-binding protein in mammalian cells (25Wold M.S. Replication protein A. A heterotrimeric, single-stranded DNA-binding protein required for eukaryotic DNA metabolism.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 61-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (1178) Google Scholar), and it plays multiple functions in nucleotide excision repair, including damage recognition, coordination and specification of nuclease activity, and repair resynthesis (11Sancar A. DNA excision repair.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 43-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (962) Google Scholar, 12Wood R.D. Nucleotide excision repair in mammalian cells.J. Biol.

Biol. 2005; 79: 183-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). TFIIH similarly functions at multiple steps during excision repair, including high specificity damage recognition by kinetic proofreading (26Reardon J.T. Sancar A. Recognition and repair of the cyclobutane thymine dimer, a major cause of skin cancers, by the human excision nuclease.Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 2539-2551Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) and unwinding the DNA around the lesion by the XPD helicase in the 5′ to 3′ direction with respect to the damaged strand (27Bessho T. Mu D. Sancar A. Initiation of DNA interstrand cross-link repair in humans. The nucleotide excision repair system makes dual incisions 5′ to the cross-linked base and removes a 22- to 28-nucleotide-long damage-free strand.Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6822-6830Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) to provide junction cutting of the repair bubble by the XPG and XPF nucleases. Remarkably, in Fig. 3A, the distribution of excision product lengths in the RPA and p62/XPB immunoprecipitates appears to be different, with the excision products associated with RPA being more distributed in length in comparison with the larger, more restricted oligomer length in the TFIIH-bound material. To determine the extent of excision product association with TFIIH and RPA, we examined the relative amounts of the 30-mer in excision assays in which most of the target repair protein was depleted from the reaction mixture by immunoprecipitation. The results are shown in Fig. 3B. The most striking finding was that depletion of TFIIH with XPB and to a slightly lesser extent with p62 antibody resulted in the removal of the larger (25–30-nt) excision products. Quantification of the relative amount of 25–30-nt oligomers removed upon TFIIH immunodepletion indicated that between 60 and 80% of the excised “canonical 30-mer” was associated with TFIIH and that ∼15–20% was associated with RPA (Fig. 3C). To further examine the apparent difference in excision product length distributions of the oligomers associated with TFIIH and RPA, we repeated the gel filtration chromatography separation of the excised oligomer from an excision reaction carried out to 90 min, which provides sufficient time for considerable degradation of the excised oligomer in the extract (Fig. 1). As shown in Fig. 3D, this approach led to a clear separation of the 25–30-nt-long oligomers from the more degraded excision products (17–23 nt). Immunoblot analyses of these fractions showed approximate overlap of the larger excision products with TFIIH and the smaller oligomers with RPA. Importantly, immunoprecipitation of TFIIH and RPA from the two peak fractions verified that the majority of the larger, 25–30-nt (canonical) excision products immunoprecipitated with TFIIH, whereas the smaller, 17–23-nt oligomers associated only with RPA (Fig. 3E). Because the 30-mer excision product is gradually degraded in cell-free extract, we next determined whether the lengths of the excision products associated with TFIIH and RPA changed as a function of reaction time. As shown in Fig. 3F, regardless of reaction time, the excision products that associated with TFIIH were only the longer (presumably the primary reaction product) oligomers 24–32 nt in length. At later time points, as the rate of excision declines while degradation of the canonical 30-mer continues (Fig. 3F, 4–6 h), there is less excision product associated with TFIIH. In contrast, the lengths of RPA-associated excision products at each time point are largely representative of the primary and secondary products in the whole reaction (input). These results further support the notion that the excised oligomers that associate with TFIIH and RPA represent distinct phases of the canonical 30-mer excision product. All of the excision reactions performed so far were done with CHO cell-free extract as a source of excision factors. To determine whether excision products similarly become bound by TFIIH and RPA in a fully reconstituted system with purified human proteins, we repeated the excision reaction followed by gel filtration chromatography and immunoprecipitation experiments with the purified repair factors. As shown in Fig. 4A, when DNA was analyzed following deproteinization, most of the excised oligomers eluted in the included volume of the gel filtration column, consistent with a molecular mass of ∼10 kDa. In contrast, and similar to that observed with cell-free extract, all of the excised oligomers eluted much earlier from the column when the excision reaction mixture was directly loaded on the column (Fig. 4, B and C). These results indicated that, similar to the reaction with the cell-free extract, all of the excised oligomers are in complex with protein in the reconstituted reaction. This was further confirmed by immunoprecipitation with TFIIH and RPA antibodies. As shown in Fig. 4D, the excised oligomers associated with both RPA and TFIIH, just as was observed in reactions with cell-free extract. However, we observed no evidence of degradation of the excision product when purified excision factors were employed. These results indicate that the degradation of the excised oligomers that occurs in cell-free extract is caused by one or more nucleases that are not present in the reconstituted system. To ascertain that TFIIH and RPA are associated with excision products that have been released from the canonical 30-nt gap, we carried out experiments with immobilized substrate and then analyzed the products. A schematic of the approach is shown in Fig. 5A: a 140-bp duplex containing 5′-biotin in one strand was added to streptavidin-coated magnetic beads and incubated with cell-free extracts, then the substrate (and gapped DNA with or without the “excised” oligomer) was removed from the reaction mixture with a magnet, and then the bound and unbound fractions were analyzed by gel electrophoresis/autoradiography. Consistent with a previous report (9Mu D. Hsu D.S. Sancar A. Reaction mechanism of human DNA repair"

Many frail elderly have poor oral health characterized by caries, poor oral hygiene, and dry mouth. However, the possible influence of such factors on taste ability in acutely hospitalized elderly has not been investigated.The study was cross-sectional. A total of 174 (55 men) acutely hospitalized elderly, coming from their own homes and with adequate cognitive function, were included. Dental status, decayed teeth, oral bacteria, oral hygiene, dry mouth and tongue changes were recorded. Growth of oral bacteria was assessed with CRT® Bacteria Kit. Taste ability was evaluated with 16 taste strips impregnated with sweet, sour, salty and bitter taste solutions in 4 concentrations each. Correct identification was given score 1, and maximum total taste score was 16.Mean age was 84 yrs. (range 70-103 yrs.). Total taste score was significantly and markedly reduced in patients with decayed teeth, poor oral hygiene, high growth of oral bacteria and dry mouth. Sweet and salty taste were particularly impaired in patients with dry mouth. Sour taste was impaired in patients with high growth of oral bacteria.This study shows that taste ability was reduced in acutely hospitalized elderly with caries activity, high growth of oral bacteria, poor oral hygiene, and dry mouth. Our findings indicate that good oral health is important for adequate gustatory function. Maintaining proper oral hygiene in hospitalized elderly should therefore get high priority among hospital staff."
https://openalex.org/W2021467741,"Acinetobacter baumannii causes severe infections in compromised patients, who present an iron-limited environment that controls bacterial growth. This pathogen has responded to this restriction by expressing high-affinity iron acquisition systems including that mediated by the siderophore acinetobactin. Gene cloning, functional assays and biochemical tests showed that the A. baumannii genome contains a single functional copy of an entA ortholog. This gene, which is essential for the biosynthesis of the acinetobactin precursor 2,3-dihydroxybenzoic acid (DHBA), locates outside of the acinetobactin gene cluster, which otherwise harbors all genes needed for acinetobactin biosynthesis, export and transport. In silico analyses and genetic complementation tests showed that entA locates next to an entB ortholog, which codes for a putative protein that contains the isochorismatase lyase domain, which is needed for DHBA biosynthesis from isochorismic acid, but lacks the aryl carrier protein domain, which is needed for tethering activated DHBA and completion of siderophore biosynthesis. Thus, basF, which locates within the acinetobactin gene cluster, is the only fully functional entB ortholog present in ATCC 19606T. The differences in amino acid length and sequences between these two EntB orthologs and the differences in the genetic context within which the entA and entB genes are found in different A. baumannii isolates indicate that they were acquired from different sources by horizontal transfer. Interestingly, the AYE strain proved to be a natural entA mutant capable of acquiring iron via an uncharacterized siderophore-mediated system, an observation that underlines the ability of different A. baumannii isolates to acquire iron using different systems. Finally, experimental infections using in vivo and ex vivo models demonstrate the role of DHBA and acinetobactin intermediates in the virulence of the ATCC 19606T cells, although to a lesser extent when compared to the responses obtained with bacteria producing and using fully matured acinetobactin to acquire iron."
https://openalex.org/W2040745850,"Partial migration (when only some individuals in a population undertake seasonal migrations) is common in many species and geographical contexts. Despite the development of modern statistical methods for analyzing partial migration, there have been no studies on what influences partial migration in tropical environments. We present research on factors affecting partial migration in African buffalo (Syncerus caffer) in northeastern Namibia. Our dataset is derived from 32 satellite tracking collars, spans 4 years and contains over 35,000 locations. We used remotely sensed data to quantify various factors that buffalo experience in the dry season when making decisions on whether and how far to migrate, including potential man-made and natural barriers, as well as spatial and temporal heterogeneity in environmental conditions. Using an information-theoretic, non-linear regression approach, our analyses showed that buffalo in this area can be divided into 4 migratory classes: migrants, non-migrants, dispersers, and a new class that we call “expanders”. Multimodel inference from least-squares regressions of wet season movements showed that environmental conditions (rainfall, fires, woodland cover, vegetation biomass), distance to the nearest barrier (river, fence, cultivated area) and social factors (age, size of herd at capture) were all important in explaining variation in migratory behaviour. The relative contributions of these variables to partial migration have not previously been assessed for ungulates in the tropics. Understanding the factors driving migratory decisions of wildlife will lead to better-informed conservation and land-use decisions in this area."
https://openalex.org/W2018296175,"Quantifying carbon (C) sequestration in paddy soils is necessary to help better understand the effect of agricultural practices on the C cycle. The objective of the present study was to assess the effects of tillage practices [conventional tillage (CT) and no-tillage (NT)] and the application of nitrogen (N) fertilizer (0 and 210 kg N ha(-1)) on fluxes of CH(4) and CO(2), and soil organic C (SOC) sequestration during the 2009 and 2010 rice growing seasons in central China. Application of N fertilizer significantly increased CH(4) emissions by 13%-66% and SOC by 21%-94% irrespective of soil sampling depths, but had no effect on CO(2) emissions in either year. Tillage significantly affected CH(4) and CO(2) emissions, where NT significantly decreased CH(4) emissions by 10%-36% but increased CO(2) emissions by 22%-40% in both years. The effects of tillage on the SOC varied with the depth of soil sampling. NT significantly increased the SOC by 7%-48% in the 0-5 cm layer compared with CT. However, there was no significant difference in the SOC between NT and CT across the entire 0-20 cm layer. Hence, our results suggest that the potential of SOC sequestration in NT paddy fields may be overestimated in central China if only surface soil samples are considered."

https://openalex.org/W1977098951,"Degradation of fibrillar collagens is important in many physiological and pathological events. These collagens are resistant to most proteases due to the tightly packed triple-helical structure, but are readily cleaved at a specific site by collagenases, selected members of the matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). To investigate the structural requirements for collagenolysis, varying numbers of GXY triplets from human type III collagen around the collagenase cleavage site were inserted between two triple helix domains of the Scl2 bacterial collagen protein. The original bacterial CL domain was not cleaved by MMP-1 (collagenase 1) or MMP-13 (collagenase 3). The minimum type III sequence necessary for cleavage by the two collagenases was 5 GXY triplets, including 4 residues before and 11 residues after the cleavage site (P4-P11'). Cleavage of these chimeric substrates was not achieved by the catalytic domain of MMP-1 or MMP-13, nor by full-length MMP-3. Kinetic analysis of the chimeras indicated that the rate of cleavage by MMP-1 of the chimera containing six triplets (P7-P11') of collagen III was similar to that of native collagen III. The collagenase-susceptible chimeras were cleaved very slowly by trypsin, a property also seen for native collagen III, supporting a local structural relaxation of the triple helix near the collagenase cleavage site. The recombinant bacterial-human collagen system characterized here is a good model to investigate the specificity and mechanism of action of collagenases."
https://openalex.org/W1964242814,"Activation of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway plays a crucial role in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor-related protein-6 (LRP6) is one of the co-receptors of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway and forms a signaling complex with Wnt ligand and Frizzled receptor to activate downstream signaling. However, the role of LRP6 in hepatocarcinogenesis is unclear. In this study, we examined its expression and roles in human HCC.Using real-time quantitative RT-PCR, we found that LRP6 was frequently (45%) overexpressed in human HCCs (P = 0.003). In vitro studies showed that ectopic expression of LRP6 increased the protein level of β-catenin. Moreover, overexpression of the full-length and constitutively active LRP6, respectively, activated the WNT/β-catenin signaling pathway, as shown by the TCF/β-catenin reporter assay. With regard to the effects of LRP6 overexpression in HCC cells, stable overexpression of the constitutively active LRP6 in BEL-7402 HCC cells enhanced cell proliferation, cell migration, and invasion in vitro as well as tumorigenicity in nude mice.Our findings indicate that overexpression of LRP6 contributes to the hyperactivation of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway in human HCCs and suggest it may play a role in hepatocarcinogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2029187804,"Aortic aneurysm is a common but life-threatening disease among the elderly, for which no effective medical therapy is currently available. Activation of prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)) is known to increase the expression of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) and the release of inflammatory cytokines, and may thus exacerbate abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) formation. We hypothesized that selective blocking of PGE(2), in particular, EP4 prostanoid receptor signaling, would attenuate the development of AAA.Immunohistochemical analysis of human AAA tissues demonstrated that EP4 expression was greater in AAA areas than that in non-diseased areas. Interestingly, EP4 expression was proportional to the degree of elastic fiber degradation. In cultured human aortic smooth muscle cells (ASMCs), PGE(2) stimulation increased EP4 protein expression (1.4 ± 0.08-fold), and EP4 stimulation with ONO-AE1-329 increased MMP-2 activity and interleukin-6 (IL-6) production (1.4 ± 0.03- and 1.7 ± 0.14-fold, respectively, P<0.05). Accordingly, we examined the effect of EP4 inhibition in an ApoE(-/-) mouse model of AAA infused with angiotensin II. Oral administration of ONO-AE3-208 (0.01-0.5 mg/kg/day), an EP4 antagonist, for 4 weeks significantly decreased the formation of AAA (45-87% reduction, P<0.05). Similarly, EP4(+/-)/ApoE(-/-) mice exhibited significantly less AAA formation than EP4(+/+)/ApoE(-/-) mice (76% reduction, P<0.01). AAA formation induced by periaortic CaCl(2) application was also reduced in EP4(+/-) mice compared with wild-type mice (73% reduction, P<0.001). Furthermore, in human AAA tissue organ cultures containing SMCs and macrophages, doses of the EP4 antagonist at 10-100 nM decreased MMP-2 activation and IL-6 production (0.6 ± 0.06- and 0.7 ± 0.06-fold, respectively, P<0.05) without increasing MMP-9 activity or MCP-1 secretion. Thus, either pharmacological or genetic EP4 inhibition attenuated AAA formation in multiple mouse and human models by lowering MMP activity and cytokine release.An EP4 antagonist that prevents the activation of MMP and thereby inhibits the degradation of aortic elastic fiber may serve as a new strategy for medical treatment of AAA."

To facilitate molecular research into reproduction and development mechanisms, and finally effective control on these pests, an extensive transcriptome for the oriental fruit fly Bactrocera dorsalis was produced using the Roche 454-FLX platform.We obtained over 350 million bases of cDNA derived from the whole body of B. dorsalis at different developmental stages. In a single run, 747,206 sequencing reads with a mean read length of 382 bp were obtained. These reads were assembled into 28,782 contigs and 169,966 singletons. The mean contig size was 750 bp and many nearly full-length transcripts were assembled. Additionally, we identified a great number of genes that are involved in reproduction and development as well as genes that represent nearly all major conserved metazoan signal transduction pathways, such as insulin signal transduction. Furthermore, transcriptome changes during development were analyzed. A total of 2,977 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were detected between larvae and pupae libraries, while there were 1,621 DEGs between adults and larvae, and 2,002 between adults and pupae. These DEGs were functionally annotated with KEGG pathway annotation and 9 genes were validated by qRT-PCR.Our data represent the extensive sequence resources available for B. dorsalis and provide for the first time access to the genetic architecture of reproduction and development as well as major signal transduction pathways in the Tephritid fruit fly pests, allowing us to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying courtship, ovipositing, development and detailed analyses of the signal transduction pathways."

https://openalex.org/W2073009505,"Multisensory learning and resulting neural brain plasticity have recently become a topic of renewed interest in human cognitive neuroscience. Music notation reading is an ideal stimulus to study multisensory learning, as it allows studying the integration of visual, auditory and sensorimotor information processing. The present study aimed at answering whether multisensory learning alters uni-sensory structures, interconnections of uni-sensory structures or specific multisensory areas. In a short-term piano training procedure musically naive subjects were trained to play tone sequences from visually presented patterns in a music notation-like system [Auditory-Visual-Somatosensory group (AVS)], while another group received audio-visual training only that involved viewing the patterns and attentively listening to the recordings of the AVS training sessions [Auditory-Visual group (AV)]. Training-related changes in cortical networks were assessed by pre- and post-training magnetoencephalographic (MEG) recordings of an auditory, a visual and an integrated audio-visual mismatch negativity (MMN). The two groups (AVS and AV) were differently affected by the training. The results suggest that multisensory training alters the function of multisensory structures, and not the uni-sensory ones along with their interconnections, and thus provide an answer to an important question presented by cognitive models of multisensory training."
https://openalex.org/W2056458080,"The oxidative process of LDL particles generates molecules which are structurally similar to platelet-activating factor (PAF), and some effects of oxidized LDL (oxLDL) have been shown to be dependent on PAF receptor (PAFR) activation. In a previous study, we showed that PAFR is required for upregulation of CD36 and oxLDL uptake. In the present study we analyzed the molecular mechanisms activated by oxLDL in human macrophages and the contribution of PAFR to this response. Human adherent monocytes/macrophages were stimulated with oxLDL. Uptake of oxLDL and CD36 expression were determined by flow cytometry; MAP kinases and Akt phosphorylation by Western blot; IL-8 and MCP-1 concentration by ELISA and mRNA expression by real-time PCR. To investigate the participation of the PI3K/Akt pathway, Gαi-coupled protein or PAFR, macrophages were treated with LY294002, pertussis toxin or with the PAFR antagonists WEB2170 and CV3988, respectively before addition of oxLDL. It was found that the addition of oxLDL to human monocytes/macrophages activates the PI3K/Akt pathway which in turn activates the MAPK (p38 and JNK). Phosphorylation of Akt requires the engagement of PAFR and a Gαi-coupled protein. The upregulation of CD36 protein and the uptake of oxLDL as well as the IL-8 production are dependent on PI3K/Akt pathway activation. The increased CD36 protein expression is dependent on PAFR and Gαi-coupled protein. Transfection studies using HEK 293t cells showed that oxLDL uptake occurs with either PAFR or CD36, but IL-8 production requires the co-transfection of both PAFR and CD36. These findings show that PAFR has a pivotal role in macrophages response to oxLDL and suggest that pharmacological intervention at the level of PAFR activation might be beneficial in atherosclerosis."
https://openalex.org/W2036329105,"Schizophrenic patients have higher smoking rates than the general population. Studies show that smoking may be a form of self-medication in an attempt to alleviate cognitive deficits in schizophrenic patients of European background. This study examined the relationships between smoking and cognitive deficits in Chinese schizophrenic patients, which have previously received little systemic study. We recruited 580 male chronic patients meeting DSM-IV criteria for schizophrenia and 175 male control subjects who were matched on age and education. The subjects completed a detailed cigarette smoking questionnaire, the Fagerstrom Test for Nicotine Dependence (FTND), and the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS). Patients also were rated on the Positive and Negative Symptom Scale (PANSS), the Simpson and Angus Extrapyramidal Symptom Rating Scale (SAES), and the Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS). All five RBANS subscales except for the Visuospatial/Constructional index showed significantly lower cognitive performance for schizophrenics than normal controls. The schizophrenic smokers scored lower than the schizophrenic non-smokers on the RBANS total score and the Visuospatial/Constructional and Immediate Memory indices. Similarly, the control smokers scored lower than the control non-smokers on the RBANS total score and the Immediate Memory index . Also, the schizophrenic smokers consistently performed the poorest on the cognitive domains of the RBANS. Among the schizophrenic patients, smokers displayed significantly fewer negative symptoms than non-smokers. Using multivariate regression analysis the following variables were independently associated with the RBANS total score: years of education, PANSS negative symptom score, age at schizophrenia onset, and number of hospitalizations. Our results show that smoking is associated with significant cognitive impairment in both schizophrenic patients and normal controls, but the smokers with schizophrenia had a reduced level of negative symptoms, suggesting that the benefits of smoking for those with schizophrenia may be limited to certain aspects of a given clinical phenotype."
https://openalex.org/W1968786908,"B-chromosomes are frequently argued to be genetically inert elements, but activity for some particular genes has been reported, especially for ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes whose expression can easily be detected at the cytological level by the visualization of their phenotypic expression, i.e., the nucleolus. The B(24) chromosome in the grasshopper Eyprepocnemis plorans frequently shows a nucleolus attached to it during meiotic prophase I. Here we show the presence of rRNA transcripts that unequivocally came from the B(24) chromosome. To detect these transcripts, we designed primers specifically anchoring at the ITS-2 region, so that the reverse primer was complementary to the B chromosome DNA sequence including a differential adenine insertion being absent in the ITS2 of A chromosomes. PCR analysis carried out on genomic DNA showed amplification in B-carrying males but not in B-lacking ones. PCR analyses performed on complementary DNA showed amplification in about half of B-carrying males. Joint cytological and molecular analysis performed on 34 B-carrying males showed a close correspondence between the presence of B-specific transcripts and of nucleoli attached to the B chromosome. In addition, the molecular analysis revealed activity of the B chromosome rDNA in 10 out of the 13 B-carrying females analysed. Our results suggest that the nucleoli attached to B chromosomes are actively formed by expression of the rDNA carried by them, and not by recruitment of nucleolar materials formed in A chromosome nucleolar organizing regions. Therefore, B-chromosome rDNA in E. plorans is functional since it is actively transcribed to form the nucleolus attached to the B chromosome. This demonstrates that some heterochromatic B chromosomes can harbour functional genes."
https://openalex.org/W2009900712,"Rapidly advancing technology has resulted in the generation of the genomic sequences of several human tumors. We have identified several mutations of the DNA polymerase β (pol β) gene in human colorectal cancer. We have demonstrated that the expression of the pol β G231D variant increased chromosomal aberrations and induced cellular transformation. The transformed phenotype persisted in the cells even once the expression of G231D was extinguished, suggesting that it resulted as a consequence of genomic instability. Biochemical analysis revealed that its catalytic rate was 140-fold slower than WT pol β, and this was a result of the decreased binding affinity of nucleotides by G231D. Residue 231 of pol β lies in close proximity to the template strand of the DNA. Molecular modeling demonstrated that the change from a small and nonpolar glycine to a negatively charged aspartate resulted in a repulsion between the template and residue 231 leading to the distortion of the dNTP binding pocket. In addition, expression of G231D was insufficient to rescue pol β-deficient cells treated with chemotherapeutic agents suggesting that these agents may be effectively used to treat tumors harboring this mutation. More importantly, this suggests that the G231D variant has impaired base excision repair. Together, these data indicate that the G231D variant plays a role in driving cancer."
https://openalex.org/W1987693111,"To assess the effects of feeding Bt MON810 maize to pigs for 110 days on the intestinal microbiota.Forty male pigs (∼40 days old) were blocked by weight and litter ancestry and assigned to one of four treatments; 1) Isogenic maize-based diet for 110 days (Isogenic); 2) Bt maize-based diet (MON810) for 110 days (Bt); 3) Isogenic maize-based diet for 30 days followed by a Bt maize-based diet for 80 days (Isogenic/Bt); 4) Bt maize-based diet for 30 days followed by an isogenic maize-based diet for 80 days (Bt/Isogenic). Enterobacteriaceae, Lactobacillus and total anaerobes were enumerated in the feces using culture-based methods on days 0, 30, 60 and 100 of the study and in ileal and cecal digesta on day 110. No differences were found between treatments for any of these counts at any time point. The relative abundance of cecal bacteria was also determined using high-throughput 16 S rRNA gene sequencing. No differences were observed in any bacterial taxa between treatments, with the exception of the genus Holdemania which was more abundant in the cecum of pigs fed the isogenic/Bt treatment compared to pigs fed the Bt treatment (0.012 vs 0.003%; P≤0.05).Feeding pigs a Bt maize-based diet for 110 days did not affect counts of any of the culturable bacteria enumerated in the feces, ileum or cecum. Neither did it influence the composition of the cecal microbiota, with the exception of a minor increase in the genus Holdemania. As the role of Holdemania in the intestine is still under investigation and no health abnormalities were observed, this change is not likely to be of clinical significance. These results indicate that feeding Bt maize to pigs in the context of its influence on the porcine intestinal microbiota is safe."
https://openalex.org/W2095415719,"The cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of cataracts leading to visual impairment remain poorly understood. In recent studies, several mutations in the cytoplasmic sterile-α-motif (SAM) domain of human EPHA2 on chromosome 1p36 have been associated with hereditary cataracts in several families. Here, we have investigated how these SAM domain mutations affect EPHA2 activity. We showed that the SAM domain mutations dramatically destabilized the EPHA2 protein in a proteasome-dependent pathway, as evidenced by the increase of EPHA2 receptor levels in the presence of the proteasome inhibitor MG132. In addition, the expression of wild-type EPHA2 promoted the migration of the mouse lens epithelial αTN4-1 cells in the absence of ligand stimulation, whereas the mutants exhibited significantly reduced activity. In contrast, stimulation of EPHA2 with its ligand ephrin-A5 eradicates the enhancement of cell migration accompanied by Akt activation. Taken together, our studies suggest that the SAM domain of the EPHA2 protein plays critical roles in enhancing the stability of EPHA2 by modulating the proteasome-dependent process. Furthermore, activation of Akt switches EPHA2 from promoting to inhibiting cell migration upon ephrin-A5 binding. Our results provide the first report of multiple EPHA2 cataract mutations contributing to the destabilization of the receptor and causing the loss of cell migration activity."
https://openalex.org/W2051204725,"Horseshoe bats emit their biosonar pulses nasally and diffract the outgoing ultrasonic waves by conspicuous structures that surrounded the nostrils. Here, we report quantitative experimental data on the motion of a prominent component of these structures, the anterior leaf, using synchronized laser Doppler vibrometry and acoustic recordings in the greater horseshoe bat (Rhinolophus ferrumequinum). The vibrometry data has demonstrated non-random motion patterns in the anterior leaf. In these patterns, the outer rim of the walls of the anterior leaf twitches forward and inwards to decrease the aperture of the noseleaf and increase the curvature of its surfaces. Noseleaf displacements were correlated with the emitted ultrasonic pulses. After their onset, the inward displacements increased monotonically towards their maximum value which was always reached within the duration of the biosonar pulse, typically towards its end. In other words, the anterior leaf's surfaces were moving inwards during most of the pulse. Non-random motions were not present in all recorded pulse trains, but could apparently be switched on or off. Such switches happened between sequences of consecutive pulses but were never observed between individual pulses within a sequence. The amplitudes of the emitted biosonar pulse and accompanying noseleaf movement were not correlated in the analyzed data set. The measured velocities of the noseleaf surface were too small to induce Doppler shifts of a magnitude with a likely significance. However, the displacement amplitudes were significant in comparison with the overall size of the anterior leaf and the sound wavelengths. These results indicate the possibility that horseshoe bats use dynamic sensing principles on the emission side of their biosonar system. Given the already available evidence that such mechanisms exist for biosonar reception, it may be hypothesized that time-variant mechanisms play a pervasive role in the biosonar sensing of horseshoe bats."
https://openalex.org/W2167442438,"Until recently, viral infections in patients with hematological malignancies were concerns primarily in allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) recipients. During the last years, changed treatment regimens for non-transplanted patients with hematological malignancies have had potential to increase the incidence of viral infections in this group. In this study, we have prospectively investigated the prevalence of a broad range of respiratory viruses in nasopharyngeal aspirate (NPA) as well as viruses that commonly reactivate after allogeneic HSCT.Patients with hematological malignancies and therapy induced neutropenia (n = 159) were screened regarding a broad range of common respiratory viruses in the nasopharynx and for viruses commonly detected in severely immunosuppressed patients in peripheral blood. Quantitative PCR was used for detection of viruses. A viral pathogen was detected in 35% of the patients. The detection rate was rather similar in blood (22%) and NPA (18%) with polyoma BK virus and rhinovirus as dominating pathogens in blood and NPA, respectively. Patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) (p<0.01) and patients with fever (p<0.001) were overrepresented in the virus-positive group. Furthermore, viral findings in NPA were associated with upper respiratory symptoms (URTS) (p<0.0001).Both respiratory viral infections and low titers of viruses in blood from patients with neutropenia were common. Patients with CLL and patients with fever were independently associated to these infections, and viral findings in NPA were associated to URTS indicating active infection. These findings motivate further studies on viruses' impact on this patient category and their potential role as causative agents of fever during neutropenia."
https://openalex.org/W1988209263,"Background Results of observational and experimental studies investigating the association between intake of long-chain n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) and risk of atrial fibrillation (AF) have been inconsistent. Methods We studied the association of fish and the fish-derived n-3 PUFAs eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) with the risk of incident AF in individuals aged 45–64 from the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) cohort (n = 14,222, 27% African Americans). Intake of fish and of DHA and EPA were measured via food frequency questionnaire. Plasma levels of DHA and EPA were measured in phospholipids in a subset of participants (n = 3,757). Incident AF was identified through the end of 2008 using ECGs, hospital discharge codes and death certificates. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to estimate hazard ratios of AF by quartiles of n-3 PUFAs or by fish intake. Results During the average follow-up of 17.6 years, 1,604 AF events were identified. In multivariable analyses, total fish intake and dietary DHA and EPA were not associated with AF risk. Higher intake of oily fish and canned tuna was associated with a nonsignificant lower risk of AF (p for trend = 0.09). Phospholipid levels of DHA+EPA were not related to incident AF. However, DHA and EPA showed differential associations with AF risk when analyzed separately, with lower risk of AF in those with higher levels of DHA but no association between EPA levels and AF risk. Conclusions In this racially diverse sample, dietary intake of fish and fish-derived n-3 fatty acids, as well as plasma biomarkers of fish intake, were not associated with AF risk."
https://openalex.org/W2036704843,"Elastin is the extracellular matrix protein in vertebrates that provides elastic recoil to blood vessels, the lung, and skin. Because the elastin gene has undergone significant changes in the primate lineage, modeling elastin diseases in non-human animals can be problematic. To investigate the pathophysiology underlying a class of elastin gene mutations leading to autosomal dominant cutis laxa, we engineered a cutis laxa mutation (single base deletion) into the human elastin gene contained in a bacterial artificial chromosome. When expressed as a transgene in mice, mutant elastin was incorporated into elastic fibers in the skin and lung with adverse effects on tissue function. In contrast, only low levels of mutant protein incorporated into aortic elastin, which explains why the vasculature is relatively unaffected in this disease. RNA stability studies found that alternative exon splicing acts as a modifier of disease severity by influencing the spectrum of mutant transcripts that survive nonsense-mediated decay. Our results confirm the critical role of the C-terminal region of tropoelastin in elastic fiber assembly and suggest tissue-specific differences in the elastin assembly pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2126242471,"The self-assembly of the tubulin homologue FtsZ at the mid-cell is a critical step in bacterial cell division. We introduce dynamic light scattering (DLS) spectroscopy as a new method to study the polymerization kinetics of FtsZ in solution. Analysis of the DLS data indicates that the FtsZ polymers are remarkably monodisperse in length, independent of the concentrations of GTP, GDP, and FtsZ monomers. Measurements of the diffusion coefficient of the polymers demonstrate that their length is remarkably stable until the free GTP is consumed. We estimated the mean size of the FtsZ polymers within this interval of stable length to be between 9 and 18 monomers. The rates of FtsZ polymerization and depolymerization are likely influenced by the concentration of GDP, as the repeated addition of GTP to FtsZ increased the rate of polymerization and slowed down depolymerization. Increasing the FtsZ concentration did not change the size of FtsZ polymers; however, it increased the rate of the depolymerization reaction by depleting free GTP. Using transmission electron microscopy we observed that FtsZ forms linear polymers in solutions which rapidly convert to large bundles upon contact with surfaces at time scales as short as several seconds. Finally, the best studied small molecule that binds to FtsZ, PC190723, had no stabilizing effect on Caulobacter crescentus FtsZ filaments in vitro, which complements previous studies with Escherichia coli FtsZ and confirms that this class of small molecules binds Gram-negative FtsZ weakly."
https://openalex.org/W2011505092,"The enzyme acetylcholinesterase (AChE) terminates synaptic transmission at cholinergic synapses by hydrolyzing the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, but can also exert ‘non-classical’, morpho-regulatory effects on developing neurons such as stimulation of neurite outgrowth. Here, we investigated the role of AChE binding to laminin-1 on the regulation of neurite outgrowth by using cell culture, immunocytochemistry, and molecular biological approaches. To explore the role of AChE, we examined fiber growth of cells overexpressing different forms of AChE, and/or during their growth on laminin-1. A significant increase of neuritic growth as compared with controls was observed for neurons over-expressing AChE. Accordingly, addition of globular AChE to the medium increased total length of neurites. Co-transfection with PRIMA, a membrane anchor of AChE, led to an increase in fiber length similar to AChE overexpressing cells. Transfection with an AChE mutant that leads to the retention of AChE within cells had no stimulatory effect on neurite length. Noticeably, the longest neurites were produced by neurons overexpressing AChE and growing on laminin-1, suggesting that the AChE/laminin interaction is involved in regulating neurite outgrowth. Our findings demonstrate that binding of AChE to laminin-1 alters AChE activity and leads to increased neurite growth in culture. A possible mechanism of the AChE effect on neurite outgrowth is proposed due to the interaction of AChE with laminin-1."
https://openalex.org/W1981437890,"There is considerable interest in pneumococcal protein antigens capable of inducing serotype-independent immunoprotection and of improving, thereby, existing vaccines. We report here on the immunogenic properties of a novel surface antigen encoded by ORF spr1875 in the R6 strain genome. An antigenic fragment encoded by spr1875, designated R4, was identified using a Streptococcus pneumoniae phage displayed genomic library after selection with a human convalescent serum. Immunofluorescence analysis with anti-R4 antisera showed that Spr1875 was expressed on the surface of strains belonging to different serotypes. Moreover, the gene was present with little sequence variability in 27 different pneumococcal strains isolated worldwide. A mutant lacking Spr1875 was considerably less virulent than the wild type D39 strain in an intravenous mouse model of infection. Moreover, immunization with the R4 recombinant fragment, but not with the whole Spr1875 protein, induced significant protection against sepsis in mice. Lack of protection after immunization with the whole protein was related to the presence of immunodominant, non-protective epitopes located outside of the R4 fragment. In conclusion, our data indicate that Spr1875 has a role in pneumococcal virulence and is immunogenic. As the R4 fragment conferred immunoprotection from experimental sepsis, selected antigenic fragments of Spr1875 may be useful for the development of a pneumococcal protein-based vaccine."
https://openalex.org/W2023425357,"Background Most research on long-term sickness absence has focussed on exposure to occupational psychosocial risk factors such as low decision latitude. These provide an incomplete explanation as they do not account for other relevant factors. Such occupational risk factors may be confounded by social or temperamental risk factors earlier in life. Methods We analysed data from the 1958 British Birth Cohort. Long-term sickness absence was defined as receipt of Incapacity Benefit/Severe Disablement Allowance at age 42. In those in employment aged 33 we examined the effects of psychological distress, musculoskeletal symptoms, and low decision latitude. These were then adjusted for IQ, educational attainment, and the presence of early life somatic and neurotic symptoms. Results Low decision latitude predicted subsequent long-term absence, and this association remained, albeit reduced, following adjustment for psychological distress and musculoskeletal symptoms at age 33. Low decision latitude was no longer associated with long-term absence when IQ and educational attainment were included. Adjusting for early life somatic and neurotic symptoms had little impact. Discussion A greater understanding of the ways in which occupational risk factors interact with individual vulnerabilities across the life-course is required. Self reported low decision latitude might reflect the impact of education and cognitive ability on how threat, and the ability to manage threat, is perceived, rather than being an independent risk factor for long-term sick leave. This has implications for policy aimed at reducing long-term sick leave."
https://openalex.org/W2000441688,"Prenatal stress, psychologically and metabolically, increases the risk of obesity and diabetes in the progeny. However, the mechanisms of the pathogenesis remain unknown. In adult mice, stress activates NPY and its Y2R in a glucocorticoid-dependent manner in the abdominal fat. This increased adipogenesis and angiogenesis, leading to abdominal obesity and metabolic syndrome which were inhibited by intra-fat Y2R inactivation. To determine whether stress elevates NPY system and accelerates adipogenic potential of embryo, here we ""stressed"" murine embryonic stem cells (mESCs) in vitro with epinephrine (EPI) during their adipogenic differentiation. EPI was added during the commitment stage together with insulin, and followed by dexamethasone in the standard adipogenic differentiation medium. Undifferentiated embryonic bodies (EBs) showed no detectable expression of NPY. EPI markedly up-regulated the expression NPY and the Y1R at the commitment stage, followed by increased Y2R mRNA at the late of the commitment stage and the differentiation stage. EPI significantly increased EB cells proliferation and expression of the preadipocyte marker Pref-1 at the commitment stage. EPI also accelerated and amplified adipogenic differentiation detected by increasing the adipocyte markers FABP4 and PPARγ mRNAs and Oil-red O-staining at the end of the differentiation stage. EPI-induced adipogenesis was completely prevented by antagonists of the NPY receptors (Y1R+Y2R+Y5R), indicating that it was mediated by the NPY system in mESC's. Taken together, these data suggest that stress may play an important role in programming ESCs for accelerated adipogenesis by altering the stress induced hormonal regulation of the NPY system."

The aggresome, a large aggregate containing misfolded proteins as well as intermediate filaments, is formed by the misfolded proteins traveling along the microtubules to the centrosome. As to the nature of the diffuse Htt species causing toxicity in mammalian cells, this has been attributed to both misfolded monomers and soluble oligomers (4Takahashi T. Kikuchi S. Katada S. Nagai Y.

Studies extending the Huntington disease model to yeast showed that the formation of Htt aggregates is dependent on the length of the polyQ repeat region in the expressed fragments, just as was observed in mammalian cells (10Krobitsch S. Lindquist S. Aggregation of huntingtin in yeast varies with the length of the polyglutamine expansion and the expression of chaperone proteins.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2000; 97: 1589-1594Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). However, unlike mammalian cells, neither a long polyQ repeat region nor the presence of visible oligomers is sufficient to cause toxicity in yeast even though toxicity only occurs when Htt with expanded polyQ repeat regions forms visible aggregates (10Krobitsch S. Lindquist S. Aggregation of huntingtin in yeast varies with the length of the polyglutamine expansion and the expression of chaperone proteins.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 35608-35615Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Instead, the aggregation of Htt fragments is generally dependent on the yeast having one of its many prion proteins in the amyloid conformation (10Krobitsch S. Lindquist S. Aggregation of huntingtin in yeast varies with the length of the polyglutamine expansion and the expression of chaperone proteins.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2000; 97: 1589-1594Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). So far 10 prions have been identified in yeast, the most common of them are [PSI+], [URE3], and [PIN+] (12Crow E.T. Li L. Newly identified prions in budding yeast, and their possible functions.Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2011; 5: 452-459Crossref Scopus (59) Google Scholar). These yeast prions contain an asparagine/glutamine-rich domain, which is prone to misfold into an amyloid conformation. The propagation of this amyloid conformation requires the molecular chaperone, Hsp104; inactivation of Hsp104 activity cures yeast of the prion phenotype. In these cured cells, regardless of the length of their polyQ repeat regions, the expressed Htt fragments are non-toxic (10Krobitsch S. Lindquist S. Aggregation of huntingtin in yeast varies with the length of the polyglutamine expansion and the expression of chaperone proteins.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2000; 97: 1589-1594Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar, 11Dehay B. Bertolotti A. Critical role of the proline-rich region in huntingtin for aggregation and cytotoxicity in yeast.J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 35608-35615Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). When Htt fragments with an expanded polyQ repeat region are expressed in yeast containing a misfolded prion, they form either multiple aggregates or one large aggregate, recently identified as an aggresome (13Wang Y. Meriin A.B. Zaarur N. Romanova N.V. Chernoff Y.O. Costello C.E. Sherman M.Y. Abnormal proteins can form aggresome in yeast: aggresome-targeting signals and components of the machinery.FASEB J. 2009; 23: 451-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Multiple aggregates of Htt fragments in the yeast cytosol can be toxic whereas no Htt toxicity has been associated with the Htt aggresome (13Wang Y. Meriin A.B. Zaarur N. Romanova N.V. Chernoff Y.O. Costello C.E. Sherman M.Y. Abnormal proteins can form aggresome in yeast: aggresome-targeting signals and components of the machinery.FASEB J. 2009; 23: 451-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), suggesting that the aggresome is protective, just as has been proposed for mammalian cells. Aggresomes only occur when the Htt fragments with an expanded polyQ repeat region also have a polyproline region downstream of the polyQ repeat region. However, not all Htt polyQ fragments with a polyproline region form an aggresome, which shows the importance of amino acids flanking the Htt fragment (14Duennwald M.L. Jagadish S. Muchowski P.J. Lindquist S. Flanking sequences profoundly alter polyglutamine toxicity in yeast.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 11045-11050Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Furthermore, even when Htt fragments with expanded polyQ repeat regions form multiple aggregates, whether the fragment is toxic depends on the amino acids flanking the polyQ repeat region (14Duennwald M.L. Jagadish S. Muchowski P.J. Lindquist S. Flanking sequences profoundly alter polyglutamine toxicity in yeast.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 11045-11050Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). For example, the HttQ103-GFP fragment without an epitope tag is not toxic, but the same fragment with an N-terminal FLAG-epitope is toxic. This latter fragment has been used extensively in many yeast studies to better characterize the toxic nature of Htt fragments with expanded polyQ repeat regions (13Wang Y. Meriin A.B. Zaarur N.

Aggregation of expanded polyglutamine domain in yeast leads to defects in endocytosis.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 7554-7565Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The toxic effect of multiple Htt aggregates appears to be due to the sequestration of proteins that have a polyQ repeat region by the Htt aggregates (20Duennwald M.L. Jagadish S. Giorgini F. Muchowski P.J. Lindquist S. A network of protein interactions determines polyglutamine toxicity.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 11051-11056Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Among the proteins that are sequestered in Htt aggregates are endocytic proteins such as Pan1 and Sla1 (17Meriin A.B. Zhang X. Alexandrov I.M. Salnikova A.B. Ter-Avanesian M.D. Chernoff Y.O. Sherman M.Y. Endocytosis machinery is involved in aggregation of proteins with expanded polyglutamine domains.FASEB J. 2007; 21: 1915-1925Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 18Meriin A.B.

Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 997-1004Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). Along with the sequestration of these proteins, Htt aggregates have been shown to cause a defect in endocytosis both in [PIN+] and [PSI+] yeast (17Meriin A.B. Zhang X. Alexandrov I.M. Salnikova A.B. Ter-Avanesian M.D. Chernoff Y.O. Sherman M.Y. Endocytosis machinery is involved in aggregation of proteins with expanded polyglutamine domains.FASEB J. 2007; 21: 1915-1925Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 19Meriin A.B. Zhang X.

Biol. 2003; 23: 7554-7565Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). However, the relationship between the endocytosis defect and toxicity has not been clearly defined since many of the proteins that affect endocytosis in yeast also affect the actin cytoskeleton. Therefore, which protein or proteins are sequestered and why this causes toxicity is unclear. In the present study, we examined in detail the effect of expressing Htt fragments in yeast with different [PSI+] prion variants in an effort to determine how sequestration causes toxicity. Our results establish that both HttQP103 and HttQ103 are toxic in yeast that contain the strong [PSI+] prion variant, but only HttQ103 is toxic in the weak [PSI+] prion variant. Expression of a C-terminal fragment of Sup35 essential for Sup35 function markedly rescued HttQP103 toxicity, but was less effective in rescuing HttQ103 toxicity. These results establish that in [PSI+] yeast, the sequestration of the translation termination factor, Sup35, is a major factor contributing to the toxicity of HttQP103. This is the first defined protein of sequestration by Htt fragments that has been shown to cause toxicity in yeast. The yeast strains in this study (gift from Dr. Susan Liebman, University of Illinois) are derivatives of 74-D694 (MATa, ade1-14 leu2-3,112 his3-Δ200 trp1-289 ura3-52). They had the following prion phenotype: [psi−]/[pin−], weak [PSI+]/[PIN+], strong [PSI+]/[PIN+], and [psi−]/high [PIN+] (21Vishveshwara N. Bradley M.E. Liebman S.W. Sequestration of essential proteins causes prion associated toxicity in yeast.Mol. Microbiol. 2009; 73: 1101-1114Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). To express huntingtin fragments, yeast were transformed with the different Htt fragments (gift from Dr. Michael Sherman (Boston University School of Medicine) under the control of the GAL1 promoter cloned in the pYES2 vector as described previously (13Wang Y. Meriin A.B. Zaarur N. Romanova N.V. Chernoff Y.O. Costello C.E. Sherman M.Y.

Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 997-1004Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). The different Htt fragments, HttQ25, HttQP25, HttQ103, and HttQP103, were expressed with a FLAG tag at its N terminus and a GFP at its C terminus. The MC fragment of Sup35 was expressed from a LEU2-based centromeric plasmid pJ528-MC (22Kirkland P.A. Reidy M. Masison D.C. Functions of yeast Hsp40 chaperone Sis1p dispensable for prion propagation but important for prion curing and protection from prion toxicity.Genetics. 2011; 188: 565-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), which is under the control of SUP35 promoter (500 bp) and fused to SUP35 terminator (200 bp of 3′-UTR). Sup45 was expressed from the SUP45 promoter from a TRP1-based centromeric plasmid (gift from S. Liebman, University of Illinois). RNQ1 was deleted in weak and strong [PSI+] strains by using homolog recombination of a PCR-amplified KanMX disruption cassette from a yeast deletion strain (ATCC). The Δrnq1 strain was verified by PCR and Western analysis using an anti-Rnq1 polyclonal antibody from Dr. E. Craig (data not shown). Yeast were grown at 30 °C on synthetic medium (SD; 0.7% yeast nitrogen base, 2% glucose) with complete supplement mixture (CSM) or the appropriate amino acid dropout supplement mixture. Galactose medium contains both 2% galactose and 2% raffinose in place of glucose. Strains having 2 micron URA3-based empty vector or plasmids containing the galactose-inducible Htt fragments were grown in SD-Ura medium to mid-log phase and then washed out twice in synthetic galactose medium without uracil (SGal-Ura) to remove residual glucose. To determine toxicity using the spot assay, cells in SGal-Ura medium (A600 = 0.5) were serially diluted 5-fold. The serial dilutions (5 μl) were plated onto a SGal-Ura plate with limited adenine. In analyzing the growth of yeast that expressed both the MC fragment of Sup35 and Htt fragments, cells with serial dilution were plated onto SGal-Ura-Leu plate with limited adenine. Images of the plates were taken after incubation of the plates for 6 days at 30 °C. To determine growth, the same number of cells calculated from optical density was plated on duplicate SD selection plates. The colonies that grew on the selection plates were counted after incubation at 30 °C for 6 days. All growth curves were from 3 independent experiments and for each time point, the average value and standard deviation are plotted. Yeast were suspended in PBS at A600 = 0.2. This yeast suspension (300 μl) was mixed with 4 μl of a stock 1 mg/ml PI solution (Sigma). Following incubation at room temperature for 30 min, the yeast were either imaged by confocal microscopy or analyzed for fluorescence by FACs. Zeiss LSM 510 confocal microscope with a 100× objective was used to acquire fluorescence, PI staining, and DIC images simultaneously. GFP-Htt and PI were imaged using the 488-nm laser and the 543-nm laser, respectively. Cells were imaged in eight-well 25-mm2 chambered coverslips (Lab-Tek, Rochester) using the identical settings for all images. Cells were imaged 23 h after induction of expression of the Htt fragments by growing cells in SGal medium. Cell lysis and Western blotting were performed as described previously with minor modifications (23Jung G. Jones G. Wegrzyn R.D. Masison D.C. A role for cytosolic Hsp70 in yeast [PSI+] prion propagation and [PSI+] as a cellular stress.Genetics. 2000; 156: 559-570Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The following antibodies were used: a polyclonal rabbit anti-Sup35 antibody made in our laboratory and anti-Pgk1 monoclonal antibody (Molecular Probes, Carlsbad, CA). Rnq1 was probed using an anti-Rnq1 polyclonal antibody (gift from E. Craig, Univ. of Wisconsin). Odyssey dye800-conjugated goat and dye800-conjugated donkey anti-mouse antibody were used as secondary antibody. Odyssey scanner and software have been used for detection of bands and quantitation of the intensity of bands on the blots represented in figures. Yeast were precultured in glucose selection medium overnight before they were transferred into galactose selection medium to induce HttQ103 and HttQP103 expression. After 22 h in galactose medium, cells were collected by centrifugation, washed once with PBS, and then stained with propodium iodide. FACS analysis on the BD FACS Calibur was used to determine the percent of propodium iodide-positive cells in the yeast population. Prior to examining whether the weak and strong [PSI+] variants affect Htt toxicity, we first characterized the [PSI+] variants. It has been shown previously that the [PSI+] variants differ in their conformation so that there is greater severing of the prion seeds by Hsp104 in the strong [PSI+] variant than in the weak [PSI+] variant (24Chien P. Weissman J.S. Conformational diversity in a yeast prion dictates its seeding specificity.Nature. 2001; 410: 223-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). This results in the strong [PSI+] variant having more seeds and less soluble Sup35 than the weak [PSI+] variant. In this study we initially examined the strong and weak [PSI+] variants that also contained the [PIN+] prion. First, to verify that the strong [PSI+] variant had a greater number of seeds than the weak variant, we measured the rate of curing of these variants when the yeast were treated with 5 mm guanidine to inactivate Hsp104. The curing curves in Fig. 1A shows that the strong [PSI+] variant took longer to cure than the weak [PSI+] variant. Specifically, there was a two generation difference between the variants when 40% of the cells were cured, and this difference in generation time became greater as the percentage of cured cells increased. Since the number of generations needed to cure [PSI+] is a measure of the number of prion seeds (25Cox B. Ness F. Tuite M. Analysis of the generation and segregation of propagons: entities that propagate the [PSI+] prion in yeast.Genetics. 2003; 165: 23-33Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), these results confirm that there are more prion seeds present in the strong than the weak [PSI+] variant, which in turn predicts that with fewer prion seeds, the weak [PSI+] variant should have more soluble Sup35 than the strong [PSI+] variant. To test this prediction, we pelleted the misfolded Sup35 by high speed centrifugation of the yeast lysates. The soluble Sup35 present in the supernatants was then assayed using Western blot analysis. Fig. 1B shows that 5–7% of the total Sup35 remained in the supernatant of the weak [PSI+] yeast lysate, while <1% of the total Sup35 remained in the supernatant of the strong [PSI+] yeast lysate. Resuspension of the pellets showed that the Sup35 sedimented during the centrifugation (Fig. 1C). As expected, more than 90% of the total Sup35 remained in the supernatant of lysates from [psi−] yeast. Thus, the strong [PSI+] variant has more prion seeds and less soluble Sup35 than the weak [PSI+] variant. The effect of expressing Htt fragments on yeast growth was first examined in [PSI+]/[PIN+] yeast with either the weak or strong variant of the [PSI+] prion. HttQ25, HttQP25, HttQ103, and HttQP103 fragments were expressed under the control of the GAL1 promoter. These fragments differ in the number of polyglutamines (25 versus 103) and the presence of a polyproline region at the C terminus. The effect of expressing these Htt fragments was examined using a spot assay in which the yeast were serially diluted on selection plates containing galactose to induce expression of the Htt fragments (Fig. 2A). The empty vector control shows that strong [PSI+]/[PIN+] yeast grew slightly slower than weak [PSI+]/[PIN+] yeast or yeast without prion. In agreement with previous studies, none of the Htt fragments caused toxicity in the absence of prion ([psi−]/[pin−]), nor did HttQP25 or HttQ25 cause toxicity in the presence of prion ([PSI+]/[PIN+]). In contrast, expression of HttQ103 and HttQP103 produced toxicity in both weak and strong [PSI+]/[PIN+] yeast. Comparison of the spot assays showed that HttQ103 was more toxic than HttQP103. Furthermore, while HttQ103 was highly toxic in both the weak and strong [PSI+] variants, HttQP103 was less toxic in the weak [PSI+] variant than in the strong [PSI+] variant. The dependence of Htt toxicity on the [PSI+] variant was confirmed by plating yeast grown in SGal-selection liquid medium, onto selection plates over a 48 h time period. Using colony count to measure growth, the data from the yeast expressing the different Htt fragments were plotted as generations versus time. Fig. 2B shows that the growth curves are in good agreement with the spot assays. None of the Htt fragments affected yeast growth in the absence of prion and expression of HttQP25 and HttQ25 had little, if any, effect on the growth of [PSI+]/[PIN+] yeast. Furthermore HttQP103 toxicity was much greater in yeast with the strong than the weak [PSI+] variant, while HttQ103 was highly toxic with both variants. The growth data showed that the Htt toxicity was dependent on the [PSI+] variant and on the Htt fragment expressed. We therefore used confocal microscopy to examine the appearance of the GFP-labeled Htt fragments when expressed for 26 h in yeast with the different [PSI+] variants. As shown previously (18Meriin A.B. Zhang X. He X. Newnam G.P. Chernoff Y.O. Sherman M.Y. Huntingtin toxicity in yeast model depends on polyglutamine aggregation mediated by a prion-like protein Rnq1.J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 997-1004Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar), all of the Htt fragments were diffusive in the prion free ([psi−]/[pin−]) cells (data not shown). In addition, HttQ25 and HttQP25 were diffusive in yeast regardless of the prion variant (data not shown), in agreement with previous studies (11Dehay B. Bertolotti A. Critical role of the proline-rich region in huntingtin for aggregation and cytotoxicity in yeast.J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 35608-35615Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 17Meriin A.B. Zhang X. Alexandrov I.M. Salnikova A.B. Ter-Avanesian M.D. Chernoff Y.O. Sherman M.Y. Endocytosis machinery is involved in aggregation of proteins with expanded polyglutamine domains.FASEB J. 2007; 21: 1915-1925Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). We next examined the expression of HttQ103 and HttQP103 in the weak and strong [PSI+]/[PIN+] yeast to determine whether their different toxicities were related to differences in aggregation. However, these fragments formed aggregates in all cells with similar appearance regardless of the prion variant present (Fig. 3). DIC staining showed that not all of the yeast cells were expressing GFP-labeled HttQ103 or HttQP103, which would explain the lack of growth of these cells when plated on selection plates. Evidently, the cells with the GFP-Htt aggregates are not proliferating, while the non-fluorescent cells are dying out with time in the selection medium. To detect dead cells in the yeast population, the yeast were stained with PI. In [PSI+]/[PIN+] yeast expressing either HttQ103 or HttQP103, around 10% of the yeast population was PI positive when measured by FACs analysis at 26 h. Therefore, there are relatively few dead cells in the yeast population after expressing the Htt fragments for 26 h even though the growth curves showed no proliferation of the yeast at this time. Since HttQ103 and HttQP103 are only toxic in yeast when aggregates are present, toxicity is evidently due to sequestration of essential protein(s) by the aggregates. However, differences in sequestration by HttQ103 and HttQP103 cannot be explained by differences in the appearance of the aggregates. Since HttQP103 was much more toxic in yeast with the strong [PSI+]/[PIN+] variant than with the weak [PSI+]/[PIN+] variant, it seemed possible that Sup35 sequestration was contributing to HttQP103 toxicity since Sup35 is an essential protein and there is less soluble Sup35 present in the strong than the weak [PSI+] variant. To determine whether this is indeed the case, [PSI+]/[PIN+] yeast were transformed with a plasmid that constitutively expresses the MC fragment of Sup35 from the SUP35 promoter to determine if this truncated fragment rescues Htt toxicity. Importantly, this MC fragment contains the C-terminal domain of Sup35, which is essential for translation termination, but lacks the N-terminal prion-forming domain. The effect of constitutive expression of the MC fragment on Htt toxicity was analyzed using the spot assay. As shown in Fig. 4A, MC rescued HttQP103 and HttQ103 toxicity in both weak and strong [PSI+]/[PIN+] yeast, but it was more effective in rescuing HttQP103 toxicity than HttQ103 toxicity. This suggests that more Sup35 is sequestered by the HttQP103 aggregates than by the HttQ103 aggregates. However, since MC does not completely rescue the toxicity of"
https://openalex.org/W2153034368,"Energy production in mitochondria is a multistep process that requires coordination of several subsystems. While reversible phosphorylation is emerging as the principal tool, it is still unclear how this signal network senses the workloads of processes as different as fuel procurement, catabolism in the Krebs cycle, and stepwise oxidation of reducing equivalents in the electron transfer chain. We previously proposed that mitochondria use oxidized cytochrome c in concert with retinol to activate protein kinase Cδ, thereby linking a prominent kinase network to the redox balance of the ETC. Here, we show that activation of PKCε in mitochondria also requires retinol as a cofactor, implying a redox-mechanism. Whereas activated PKCδ transmits a stimulatory signal to the pyruvate dehdyrogenase complex (PDHC), PKCε opposes this signal and inhibits the PDHC. Our results suggest that the balance between PKCδ and ε is of paramount importance not only for flux of fuel entering the Krebs cycle but for overall energy homeostasis. We observed that the synthetic retinoid fenretinide substituted for the retinol cofactor function but, on chronic use, distorted this signal balance, leading to predominance of PKCε over PKCδ. The suppression of the PDHC might explain the proapoptotic effect of fenretinide on tumor cells, as well as the diminished adiposity observed in experimental animals and humans. Furthermore, a disturbed balance between PKCδ and PKCε might underlie the injury inflicted on the ischemic myocardium during reperfusion. dehydrogenase complex."

Here we describe a function-based strategy for selecting rare cancer cells that are highly adaptable and drive malignancy. Although cancer cells are dependent on certain nutrients, e.g., glucose and glutamine, we hypothesized that the adaptable cancer cells that drive malignancy must possess an adaptable metabolic state and that such cells could be identified using a robust selection strategy. As expected, more than 99.99% of cells died upon glutamine withdrawal from the aggressive breast cancer cell line SUM149. The rare cells that survived and proliferated without glutamine were highly adaptable, as judged by additional robust adaptability assays involving prolonged cell culture without glucose or serum. We were successful in isolating rare metabolically plastic glutamine-independent (Gln-ind) variants from several aggressive breast cancer cell lines that we tested. The Gln-ind cells overexpressed cyclooxygenase-2, an indicator of tumor aggressiveness, and they were able to adjust their glutaminase level to suit glutamine availability. The Gln-ind cells were anchorage-independent, resistant to chemotherapeutic drugs doxorubicin and paclitaxel, and resistant to a high concentration of a COX-2 inhibitor celecoxib. The number of cells being able to adapt to non-availability of glutamine increased upon prior selection of cells for resistance to chemotherapy drugs or resistance to celecoxib, further supporting a linkage between cellular adaptability and therapeutic resistance. Gln-ind cells showed indications of oxidative stress, and they produced cadherin11 and vimentin, indicators of mesenchymal phenotype. Gln-ind cells were more tumorigenic and more metastatic in nude mice than the parental cell line as judged by incidence and time of occurrence. As we decreased the number of cancer cells in xenografts, lung metastasis and then primary tumor growth was impaired in mice injected with parental cell line, but not in mice injected with Gln-ind cells."
https://openalex.org/W2010021375,"In neurons, the shape of dendritic spines relates to synapse function, which is rapidly altered during experience-dependent neural plasticity. The small size of spines makes detailed measurement of their morphology in living cells best suited to super-resolution imaging techniques. The distribution of molecular positions mapped via live-cell Photoactivated Localization Microscopy (PALM) is a powerful approach, but molecular motion complicates this analysis and can degrade overall resolution of the morphological reconstruction. Nevertheless, the motion is of additional interest because tracking single molecules provides diffusion coefficients, bound fraction, and other key functional parameters. We used Monte Carlo simulations to examine features of single-molecule tracking of practical utility for the simultaneous determination of cell morphology. We find that the accuracy of determining both distance and angle of motion depend heavily on the precision with which molecules are localized. Strikingly, diffusion within a bounded region resulted in an inward bias of localizations away from the edges, inaccurately reflecting the region structure. This inward bias additionally resulted in a counterintuitive reduction of measured diffusion coefficient for fast-moving molecules; this effect was accentuated by the long camera exposures typically used in single-molecule tracking. Thus, accurate determination of cell morphology from rapidly moving molecules requires the use of short integration times within each image to minimize artifacts caused by motion during image acquisition. Sequential imaging of neuronal processes using excitation pulses of either 2 ms or 10 ms within imaging frames confirmed this: processes appeared erroneously thinner when imaged using the longer excitation pulse. Using this pulsed excitation approach, we show that PALM can be used to image spine and spine neck morphology in living neurons. These results clarify a number of issues involved in interpretation of single-molecule data in living cells and provide a method to minimize artifacts in single-molecule experiments."
https://openalex.org/W2046646461,"Background Testes-specific protease 50 (TSP50), a newly discovered threonine enzyme, has similar amino acid sequences and enzymatic structures to those of many serine proteases. It may be an oncogene. TSP50 is up-regulated in breast cancer epithelial cells, and ectopic expression of TSP50 in TSP50-deficient Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells has been found to promote cell proliferation. However, the mechanisms by which TSP50 exerts its growth-promoting effects are not yet fully understood. Methodology/Principal Findings To delineate whether the threonine protease activity of TSP50 is essential to its function in cell proliferation, we constructed and characterized a mutant TSP50, called TSP50 T310A, which was identified as a protease-dead mutant of TSP50. By a series of proliferation analyses, colony formation assays and apoptosis analyses, we showed that T310A mutation significantly depresses TSP50-induced cell proliferation in vitro. Next, the CHO stable cell line expressing either wild-type or T310A mutant TSP50 was injected subcutaneously into nude mice. We found that the T310A mutation could abolish the tumorigenicity of TSP50 in vivo. A mechanism investigation revealed that the T310A mutation prevented interaction between TSP50 and the NF-κBIκBα complex, which is necessary for TSP50 to perform its function in cell proliferation. Conclusion Our data highlight the importance of threonine 310, the most critical protease catalytic site in TSP50, to TSP50-induced cell proliferation and tumor formation."
https://openalex.org/W1999870143,"DNA phosphorothioation is widespread among prokaryotes, and might function to restrict gene transfer among different kinds of bacteria. There has been little investigation into the structural mechanism of the DNA phosphorothioation process. DndA is a cysteine desulfurase which is involved in the first step of DNA phosphorothioation. In this study, we determined the crystal structure of Streptomyces lividans DndA in complex with its covalently bound cofactor PLP, to a resolution of 2.4 Å. Our structure reveals the molecular mechanism that DndA employs to recognize its cofactor PLP, and suggests the potential binding site for the substrate L-cysteine on DndA. In contrast to previously determined structures of cysteine desulfurases, the catalytic cysteine of DndA was found to reside on a β strand. This catalytic cysteine is very far away from the presumable location of the substrate, suggesting that a conformational change of DndA is required during the catalysis process to bring the catalytic cysteine close to the substrate cysteine. Moreover, our in vitro enzymatic assay results suggested that this conformational change is unlikely to be a simple result of random thermal motion, since moving the catalytic cysteine two residues forward or backward in the primary sequence completely disabled the cysteine desulfurase activity of DndA."

However, in the PACSIN subfamily, the F-BAR domain from PACSIN 1 and 2 can induce both high and low curvature tubules. We found that unlike PACSIN 1 and 2, PACSIN 3 could only induce low curvature tubules. To elucidate the key factors that dictate the tubule curvature, crystal structures of all three PACSIN F-BAR domains were determined. A novel type of lateral interaction mediated by a wedge loop is observed between the F-BAR neighboring dimers. Comparisons of the structures of PACSIN 3 with PACSIN 1 and 2 indicate that the wedge loop of PACSIN 3 is more rigid, which influences the lateral interactions between assembled dimers. We further identified the residues that affect the rigidity of the loop by mutagenesis and determined the structures of two PACSIN 3 wedge loop mutants. Our results suggest that the rigidity-mediated conformations of the wedge loop correlate well with the various crystal packing modes and membrane tubulations.

In contrast to the typical F-BAR domain proteins that mainly generate low curvature tubules (100 nm in diameter), PACSIN 1 and 2 can induce a wide range radius of membrane tubules including not only the typical 100-nm tubule but also smaller tubules with an average diameter of 10 nm. In addition, they also facilitate tubule constrictions (31Wang Q. Navarro M.V. Peng G. Molinelli E. Goh S.L. Judson B.L. Rajashankar K.R. Sondermann H.

U.S.A. 2009; 106: 12700-12705Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Both crystal structures of the F-BAR domain of PACSIN 1 and 2 reveal a unique wedge loop, which was proposed to contribute to membrane insertion and binding (31Wang Q. Navarro M.V. Peng G.

A hinge in the distal end of the murine PACSIN 2 F-BAR domain was predicted to contribute to membrane curvature sensing (32Plomann M. Wittmann J.G. Rudolph M.G. A hinge in the distal end of the PACSIN 2 F-BAR domain may contribute to membrane-curvature sensing.J. Mol. Biol. 2010; 400: 129-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). However, the detailed mechanism of how the F-BAR dimers of PACSIN induce various curvature tubulations remains unclear. To elucidate further the mechanism of membrane remodeling by the F-BAR domain of PACSINs, we investigated the membrane deformation by the PACSIN 3 F-BAR domain compared with PACSIN 1 and PACSIN 2 F-BAR domains, by negative-stain electron microscopy. We further determined the structures of the F-BAR domains from PACSIN 3, PACSIN 1, PACSIN 2, and two PACSIN 3 loop mutants, E128A and P121Q. We found that different from PACSIN 1 and 2, PACSIN 3 could only induce ∼100-nm tubules. Based on structure studies, we discovered that the more rigid PACSIN 3 wedge loop, which is in a different structural conformation compared with PACSIN 1 and 2, contributes to the distinct lattice formed by the PACSIN 3 F-BAR domain in the crystal. The parallel lattice of PACSIN 3 reveals a novel type of wedge loop-mediated lateral interaction between neighboring dimers, and the lattice is related to protein packing on the tubulated membrane. We further identified the residues that determine the rigidity of the wedge loop in the PACSIN 3 F-BAR domain. The mutations of these residues change the structural conformation of the wedge loop, which alters the wedge loop-mediated lateral interactions between neighboring dimers and further influences the membrane curvature. Therefore, the rigidity of the wedge loop in PACSIN 3 is a key factor in dictating the diameters of tubules. The F-BAR domain of PACSIN 1 (residues 1–344), PACSIN 1 mutants, the F-BAR domain of PACSIN 2 (residues 1–372) and PACSIN 2 mutant E130A, the F-BAR domain of mouse PACSIN 3 (residues 1–341, which has 94% amino acid sequence identity to human PACSIN 3) and PACSIN 3 mutants, were cloned into pET28a vector. All proteins except PACSIN 1 truncate 1–344 were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) cells and purified on a Ni2+-HiTrap affinity column followed by a Superdex-75 column (GE Healthcare) (33Bai X.

Initial crystallization conditions were screened using kits from Hampton Research including PEG, Crystal Screen, Crystal Screen 2, and Index. Crystals were optimized by the hanging-drop vapor diffusion method. Drops were prepared by mixing 2 μl of protein solution (8 mg/ml protein in 500 mm NaCl, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5) with 2 μl of reservoir solution and were equilibrated against 500 μl of reservoir solution at 293 K.

For crystal data collection, crystals were flash-cooled with a nitrogen stream at 100 K, and x-ray diffraction data were collected on Mar 345 image plate detector at SSRF.

Lipids containing 80% DOPC and 20% DOPA (Avanti) were mixed and dissolved in chloroform. The organic solvent was removed by evaporation under a stream of nitrogen gas, followed by incubation for 2 h in a vacuum to ensure complete removal of solvent. Lipid films were resuspended in HEPES buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl, 0.2 mm EDTA) and subjected to 10 freeze-thaw cycles. Large unilamellar vesicles were then formed by extrusion through 100-nm nucleopore polycarbonate membranes. The prepared liposomes were stored at 4 °C. Protein (1 mg/ml) was incubated with liposome (1 mg/ml) with 1:1 protein-lipid volume ratio for 20 min at room temperature. The protein-lipid mixture was centrifuged at 140,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C in an ultracentrifuge (Beckman TLA100 rotor). Supernatants were then collected, and pellets were resuspended in 40 μl of sample buffer. Proteins in both fractions were subjected to SDS-PAGE, stained with Coomassie Blue, and visualized by a Bio-Rad XRS system.

The grid was examined on a transmission electron microscope (FEI 200 kV) with electron energy set to 120 kV. To investigate the membrane deformation induced by PACSINs, the F-BAR domains from PACSIN 1, 2, and PACSIN 3 were expressed in E. coli and purified to near homogeneity. Liposome tubulation induced by F-BAR domains was examined by negative stain electron microscopy. Unlike other F-BAR domain-containing proteins, tubules induced by PACSIN 1 and 2 have various diameters, which is consistent with previous reports (31Wang Q. Navarro M.V. Peng G. Molinelli E. Goh S.L. Judson B.L. Rajashankar K.R. Sondermann H. Molecular mechanism of membrane constriction and tubulation mediated by the F-BAR protein PACSIN/syndapin.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 12700-12705Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). These tubules are mainly classified into three classes: the first class has low curvature with a diameter of ∼100 nm, the second class has intermediate curvature with a diameter of ∼50 nm, and the third class has high curvature with a diameter of ∼10 nm (Fig. 1A). In addition, tubules with other diameters were also observed. In contrast, the PACSIN 3 F-BAR domain could only induce low curvature tubules of ∼100-nm diameter (Fig. 1A), despite sharing 55 and 60% sequence identity with the F-BAR domain of PACSIN 1 and 2, respectively. To elucidate the molecular mechanism to explain the differences in membrane tubulation between PACSIN 3 and PACSIN 1, 2, we crystallized and determined the structures of the F-BAR domain of PACSIN 3 (residues 1–304), as well as that of PACSIN 1 (residues 14–308) and PACSIN 2 (residues 1–304) (supplemental Fig. 1 and Table 1). The structure of the PACSIN 1 F-BAR domain was determined by single anomalous dispersion phasing, using data collected with a crystal of selenomethionine-derivatized protein, and the structures of PACSIN 2 and PACSIN 3 F-BAR domains were solved by molecular replacement using the initial structure of the PACSIN 1 F-BAR domain as the searching model. The structures of PACSIN 1, PACSIN 2, and PACSIN 3 F-BAR domains were refined to resolutions of 2.9, 2.7, and 2.6 Å in the space groups C2, P21, and P21, respectively (Table 1). The structures showed that PACSINs form a dimer in the crystal and adopt a crescent shape with a six-helix bundle core and two three-helix bundle arms extending from the central body. Each monomer is composed of six α-helices that interact with the other monomer in an antiparallel manner. Two neighboring helices α1 form the main central dimerization interface that are flanked by two wings composed of helix α3 and the curved region of helix α4. Helix α3 and a longer helix α4 both extend the length of the monomer with bending ends. Helix α2 and the shorter helices α5 and α6 generate the bundle center that is associated with helix α1 (Fig. 1B and supplemental Fig. 1A). The structure-based sequence alignment of the residues on the protein surface of the F-BAR domains of PACSINs showed that the positively charged residues on the concave surface are highly conserved (supplemental Fig. 1, B and C). Consistent with the previously determined structures of the F-BAR domain of PACSIN 1 and 2 (31Wang Q. Navarro M.V. Peng G. Molinelli E. Goh S.L. Judson B.L. Rajashankar K.R. Sondermann H.

Open table in a new tab Despite the structure similarity between the F-BAR dimer of PACSIN 3 and those of PACSIN 1 and 2, we found that the packing patterns of the neighboring dimers of these proteins are strikingly different in the crystal: PACSIN 3 shows only a parallel packing among all the different crystallization conditions that have been examined, whereas PACSIN 1 and 2 show different packing modes (supplemental Fig. 2). We also found that the parallel packing of the PACSIN 3 F-BAR domain is similar to the packing lattice of the CIP4 F-BAR domain observed on the tubules by cryo-EM (18Frost A. Perera R. Roux A. Spasov K. Destaing O. Egelman E.H. De Camilli P. Unger V.M. Structural basis of membrane invagination by F-BAR domains.Cell. 2008; 132: 807-817Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). However, a close-up view of the PACSIN 3 structure reveals a distinct type of lateral interaction between two neighboring dimers (Fig. 2A), in addition to the typical CIP4-like tip-to-tip interaction. In CIP4, the lateral interactions between the neighboring dimers involve only the residues of neighboring helices, whereas in PACSIN 3, the lateral interactions are between one of the PACSIN-specific wedge loops with the helix α2 of the neighboring dimer (Fig. 2, A, left, and B, upper). The other wedge loop of the same dimer extends out into the membrane direction (Fig. 2, A, right, and B, lower). This observation suggests that the wedge loop might function in two ways: one loop in the dimer is involved in the lateral interaction, and the other loop in the dimer extends out and inserts into the membrane bilayer. To confirm that the wedge loop is involved in the interactions between the neighboring dimers, we mutated the residues located in the lateral contacting area (Fig. 2C, left). A total of 15 mutants of the five residues on the contacting surface were constructed. The mutants were purified and examined by a liposome tubulation assay (Fig. 3A). The binding of these mutants to liposomes was investigated by a sedimentation assay (Fig. 3B). Mutations in the wedge loop (H119E/A/Q, R127E/A/Q) or in the contacting area (E93R/A/Q, E97R/A/Q and E100R/A/Q) abolished the liposome tubulation activity completely, but retained the liposome binding ability (Fig. 3 and supplemental Fig. 3B). This observation indicates that the interaction between the wedge loop and its neighboring dimer plays critical roles in protein packing on the membrane to induce liposome tubulation. We further examined the residues on the wedge loop that may insert into the membrane bilayer. A series of mutants of the wedge loop, ΔV122L123, V122E/L123E, and V122R/L123R of PACSIN 3 (Fig. 2C, right) were constructed in"

A conserved attribute of the E4-ORF3 proteins of different human adenoviruses is the ability to disrupt PML nuclear bodies from their normally punctate appearance into heterogeneous filamentous structures. This E4-ORF3 activity correlates with the inhibition of PML-mediated antiviral activity. The mechanism of E4-ORF3-mediated reorganization of PML nuclear bodies is unknown. Biophysical analysis of the purified WT E4-ORF3 protein revealed an ordered secondary/tertiary structure and the ability to form heterogeneous higher-order multimers in solution. Importantly, a nonfunctional E4-ORF3 mutant protein, L103A, forms a stable dimer with WT secondary structure content. Because the L103A mutant is incapable of PML reorganization, this result suggests that higher-order multimerization of E4-ORF3 may be required for the activity of the protein. In support of this hypothesis, we demonstrate that the E4-ORF3 L103A mutant protein acts as a dominant-negative effector when coexpressed with the WT E4-ORF3 in mammalian cells.

https://openalex.org/W2018126030,"Sensitive and specific tests for detecting exogenous DNA molecules are useful for infectious disease diagnosis, gene therapy clinical trial safety, and gene doping surveillance. Taqman real-time PCR using specific sequence probes provides an effective approach to accurately and quantitatively detect exogenous DNA. However, one of the major challenges in these analyses is to eliminate false positive signals caused by either non-targeted exogenous or endogenous DNA sequences, or false negative signals caused by impurities that inhibit PCR. Although multiplex Taqman PCR assays have been applied to address these problems by adding extra primer-probe sets targeted to endogenous DNA sequences, the differences between targets can lead to different detection efficiencies. To avoid these complications, a Taqman PCR-based approach that incorporates an internal threshold control (ITC) has been developed. In this single reaction format, the target sequence and ITC template are co-amplified by the same primers, but are detected by different probes each with a unique fluorescent dye. Sample DNA, a prescribed number of ITC template molecules set near the limit of sensitivity, a single pair of primers, target probe and ITC probe are added to one reaction. Fluorescence emission signals are obtained simultaneously to determine the cycle thresholds (Ct) for amplification of the target and ITC sequences. The comparison of the target Ct with the ITC Ct indicates if a sample is a true positive for the target (i.e. Ct less than or equal to the ITC Ct) or negative (i.e. Ct greater than the ITC Ct). The utility of this approach was demonstrated in a nonhuman primate model of rAAV vector mediated gene doping in vivo and in human genomic DNA spiked with plasmid DNA."

Our aim was to characterize the cardiac phenotype of male knock-out mice that are deficient in alpha-galactosidase A activity, as a model for Fabry disease and test the efficacy of Enzyme Replacement Therapy with agalsidase-beta. Male mice (3-4 months of age) were characterized with awake blood pressure and heart rate measurements, cardiac echocardiography and electrocardiography measurements under light anesthesia, histological studies and molecular studies with real-time polymerase chain reaction. The Fabry knock-out mouse has bradycardia and lower blood pressure than control wild type (CB7BL/6J) mice. In Fabry knock-out mice, the cardiomyopathy associated mild hypertrophy at echography with normal systolic LV function and mild diastolic dysfunction. Premature atrial contractions were more frequent in without conduction defect. Heart weight normalized to tibial length was increased in Fabry knock-out mice. Ascending aorta dilatation was observed. Molecular studies were consistent with early stages of cardiac remodeling. A single dose of agalsidase-beta (3 mg/kg) did not affect the LV hypertrophy, function or heart rate, but did improve the mRNA signals of early cardiac remodeling. In conclusion, the alpha-galactosidase A deficient mice at 3 to 4 months of age have cardiac and vascular alterations similar to that described in early clinical stage of Fabry disease in children and adolescents. Enzyme replacement therapy affects cardiac molecular remodeling after a single dose."

The Sdh1p subunit contains the active site where succinate binds near a covalently attached flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD).

Most mutations of SDHA result in Leigh syndrome, a severe, progressive neurodegenerative disease (2Bardella C. Pollard P.J. Tomlinson I. SDH mutations in cancer.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2011; 1807: 1432-1443Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar), but recently, SDHA was identified as a new paraganglioma and pheochromocytoma susceptibility gene (7Burnichon N. Brire J.J.

The succinate:quinone oxidoreductase family to which SDH belongs is structurally diverse and can be divided into five classes based on membrane domain subunit composition and heme content (13Lancaster C.R. Succinate:quinone oxidoreductases: an overview.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1553: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Fumarate reductases, also members of this family, are anaerobically expressed enzymes that oxidize quinols and reduce fumarate to succinate, the reverse of the SDH reaction (14Cole S.T. Condon C. Lemire B.D. Weiner J.H. Molecular biology, biochemistry and bioenergetics of fumarate reductase, a complex membrane-bound iron-sulfur flavoenzyme of Escherichia coli.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 811: 381-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The Sdh1p/Sdh2p catalytic dimer is believed to have evolved from the association of a soluble fumarate reductase containing non-covalent FAD (in the Sdh1p subunit) with a ferredoxin electron donor (in the Sdh2p subunit) (15Hederstedt L. Respiration without O2.Science. 1999; 284: 1941-1942Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). For type C enzymes like the SDH of eukaryotic mitochondria, the catalytic dimer became membrane-bound by associating with a pair of membrane proteins coordinating two hemes (13Lancaster C.R. Succinate:quinone oxidoreductases: an overview.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1553: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Attachment to the membrane presumably provided a bioenergetic advantage. Later, the FAD became covalently attached, favoring succinate oxidation over fumarate reduction. Sites for quinol chemistry were optimized, and one of the hemes was lost. Prokaryotes and eukaryotes now express a number of fumarate reductase and SDH variants containing zero, one, or two hemes with membrane domains of different architectures optimized to utilize a variety of quinone species. Some genomes, such as that of Escherichia coli, contain genes for separate fumarate reductase and SDH enzymes. The complexity of succinate:quinone oxidoreductases can be exploited to provide developmental advantages. The presence of more than one SDH subunit isoform can confer alternative enzymatic properties on the enzyme. For example, the parasitic nematode Ascaris suum complex II changes subunit composition during its life cycle (16Iwata F. Shinjyo N. Amino H. Sakamoto K. Islam M.K. Tsuji N. Kita K. Change of subunit composition of mitochondrial complex II (succinate-ubiquinone reductase/quinol-fumarate reductase) in Ascaris suum during the migration in the experimental host.Parasitol.

The adult and third stage larval forms of this intestinal parasite contain different subunits equivalent to Sdh1p and Sdh4p, whereas the subunits equivalent to Sdh2p and Sdh3p subunits remain the same. The larval enzyme acts preferentially as a fumarate reductase, whereas the adult enzyme is optimized for succinate oxidation. In the parasitic sheep nematode Haemonchus contortus, differential expression of Sdh2p subunit isoforms occurs when the SDH of free living third stage larvae that is poised for succinate oxidation is converted to an enzyme that favors fumarate reduction in the adult stage (17Roos M.H. Tielens A.G. Differential expression of two succinate dehydrogenase subunit-B genes and a transition in energy metabolism during the development of the parasitic nematode Haemonchus contortus.Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1994; 66: 273-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In the case of Arabidopsis thaliana, three genes for Sdh2p subunits are present; one of these, SDH2–3 is only expressed in embryonic and not vegetative tissues (18Elorza A. Roschzttardtz H. Gómez I.

A nuclear gene for the iron-sulfur subunit of mitochondrial complex II is specifically expressed during Arabidopsis seed development and germination.Plant Cell Physiol. 2006; 47: 14-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The S. cerevisiae genome also contains SDH subunit isoforms. An alternative isoform of Sdh1p (YJL045w) referred to as Sdh1bp was identified; it has 84% sequence identity with Sdh1p and is able to complement a Δsdh1 strain when expressed from a multicopy plasmid (19Colby G. Ishii Y. Tzagoloff A. Suppression of sdh1 mutations by the SDH1b gene of Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Yeast. 1998; 14: 1001-1006Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). An Sdh3p homolog called YMR118c is a mitochondrial membrane protein of 196 amino acid residues with 57% sequence identity and 72% similarity to Sdh3p. Two Sdh4p homologs, YLR164w and YOR297c, are respectively 52 and 36% identical and 74 and 57% similar to Sdh4p. YOR297c is also called Tim18p, a subunit of the TIM22 mitochondrial inner membrane import complex, which mediates the import of polytopic inner membrane proteins lacking cleavable presequences (20Kerscher O. Sepuri N.B. Jensen R.E. Tim18p is a new component of the Tim54p-Tim22p translocon in the mitochondrial inner membrane.Mol. Biol.

Tim18p can be co-immunoprecipitated with Tim54p, Tim22p, and Tim12p. Furthermore, disruption of the TIM18 gene is synthetic lethal with tim54(ts), tim9(ts), and tim10(ts) mutations, confirming that Tim18p is an authentic component of the import machinery (20Kerscher O. Sepuri N.B. Jensen R.E. Tim18p is a new component of the Tim54p-Tim22p translocon in the mitochondrial inner membrane.Mol. Biol.

Tim18p, like Sdh4p, contains three transmembrane helices with its amino terminus in the matrix (20Kerscher O. Sepuri N.B. Jensen R.E.

More recently, Sdh3p was also found in a subcomplex with Tim18p as part of the TIM22 inner membrane translocase complex (22Gebert N. Gebert M. Oeljeklaus S. von der Malsburg K. Stroud D.A.

Overexpression of Sdh3p partially suppressed the growth defect of a tim22-44 mutant, demonstrating a functional role in the translocase (22Gebert N. Gebert M. Oeljeklaus S. von der Malsburg K.

In this study, we investigated the ability of YMR118c to substitute for Sdh3p and for YLR164w and YOR297c/Tim18p to substitute for Sdh4p. We found that YMR118c and YLR164w, which have been given the gene names SHH3 (Sdh3 homolog) and SHH4 (Sdh4 homolog) (22Gebert N. Gebert M. Oeljeklaus S. von der Malsburg K. Stroud D.A. Kulawiak B.

In contrast, YOR297c/Tim18p was not able to complement a Δsdh4 deletion strain even when overexpressed. We characterized the kinetic properties of hybrid SDH enzymes containing one or both of these paralogs. Using 1H NMR, we also show that expression of one or both complementing paralogs resulted in distinct metabotypes. Sdh3p is capable of forming at least three different protein complexes in the mitochondrial inner membrane and plays important roles in energy generation and mitochondrial biogenesis. The S. cerevisiae strains sdh3W1 (MH125, sdh3::TRP1), sdh4W2 (MH125, sdh4::TRP1), and sdh3W1/4K6 (YPH499, sdh3::TRP1, sdh4::LYS2) and the Escherichia coli strain DH5α have been described previously (23Szeto S.S.

The SHH3 gene (YMR118c) was amplified from yeast genomic DNA by PCR as a 1-kb fragment with BamHI sites introduced at both ends. The fragment was cloned into the low copy centromeric plasmid YCplac33 and the high copy episomal plasmids YEplac181 and YEplac195 (25Gietz R.D. Sugino A. New yeast-Escherichia coli shuttle vectors constructed with in vitro mutagenized yeast genes lacking six-base pair restriction sites.Gene. 1988; 74: 527-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (2519) Google Scholar). Similarly, the SHH4 gene (YLR164w) was amplified by PCR as a 0.9-kb fragment with EcoRI sites and cloned into YCplac33 and YEplac195. All cloned genes were sequenced in their entirety. The TIM18 gene was cloned as a 1.2-kb EcoRI fragment from pOK94 (20Kerscher O. Sepuri N.B. Jensen R.E.

YPGal medium was inoculated to a starting A600 of 0.1 and grown at 30 °C for 3 days. Cells were harvested, washed, and lysed in a French pressure cell (26Oyedotun K.S. Lemire B.D.

Mitochondrial membranes were isolated by differential centrifugation, resuspended in 20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.4, flash frozen in liquid N2, and stored at −80 °C. SDH is normally isolated partially inhibited by oxaloacetate. To activate it, membranes are preincubated in 20 mm succinate for 15 min at 30 °C immediately prior to assaying (27Oyedotun K.S.

The malonate-sensitive, succinate-dependent phenazine methosulfate (PMS)-mediated reduction of dichlorophenol indophenol (DCPIP) is used as a measure of membrane-associated catalytic dimer; this activity does not require a catalytically competent membrane domain. The malonate-sensitive, succinate-dependent reduction of quinone was monitored spectrophotometrically as the decylubiquinone (DB)-mediated reduction of DCPIP. Kinetic parameters for DB were determined by varying its concentration at fixed saturating concentrations of succinate and DCPIP. The apparent Km and Vmax values were calculated from a non-linear regression fit of the data to the Michaelis-Menten equation using SigmaPlot 11.0 (Systat Software). SDH thermal stability was examined by incubating activated membrane fractions for 10 min at temperatures ranging from 30 to 65 °C and assaying for succinate-DB reductase activity. Malonate-sensitive, succinate-dependent cytochrome c reductase activity was measured as described (28Robinson K.M. Lemire B.D. Flavinylation of succinate: ubiquinone oxidoreductase from Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Methods Enzymol. 1995; 260: 34-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Values represent the mean of at least 15 measurements ±S.D. unless indicated.

Cells were grown for 36 h at 30 °C in 2 ml of 2% yeast extract, 1% peptone, 0.25% glucose after which the optical density at 600 nm was measured. The remainder of the culture was centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 2 min. The clarified media were transferred to new microcentrifuge tubes and adjusted to 5% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid (TCA). Samples were incubated for 30 min on ice and centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. Supernatants were recovered, the pH was neutralized with NaOH, and samples were flash frozen. Samples were lyophilized for 2 days and stored at 4 °C with desiccant. About 50 mg of each lyophilized sample were dissolved in 570 μl of D2O (99.9%; Isotec Inc., Miamisburg, OH); 30 μl of 5 mm 2,2-dimethyl-2-sila-3,3,4,4,5,5-hexadeuteropentane sulfonic acid (DSS-d6; Chenomx Inc., Edmonton, Alberta, Canada) were added as a concentration standard and chemical shift indicator. The pH was recorded for calibration purposes, and residual particulate matter was removed by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 3 min. 510 μl of supernatants were transferred to 5-mm-diameter NMR tubes for spectroscopic analysis. One-dimensional 1H NMR spectra were acquired as described previously (23Szeto S.S. Reinke S.N. Sykes B.D. Lemire B.D.

All spectra were acquired using transform NOESY pulse sequence (Vnmr 6.1B software, Varian Inc., Palo Alto, CA) on a 600-MHz Varian Inova spectrometer (Varian Inc.). The following conditions and parameters were used: 30 °C, 4-s acquisition time, 1-s preacquisition delay, 0.1-s mixing time, 7200-Hz sweep width, 7.95-μs pulse width, and 256 transients (23Szeto S.S.

All spectra were Fourier transformed without applying line broadening, referenced to the DSS-d6 standard, manually phased, and base line-corrected. Identification and quantification of metabolites were performed using Chenomx NMR Suite Professional software v5.1 (Chenomx Inc.). To compare data between strains, we normalized the metabolite concentrations to the mass of lyophilized material and to the final optical densities of the respective cultures. To model and interpret metabolic data, multivariate analysis was performed using Simca P+ v12.0.1 software (Umetrics, Umeå, Sweden). Data were mean-centered and scaled to unit variance. Initial inspections of data were carried out using principal component analysis to identify potential outliers (data not shown). Subsequently, the data were subjected to partial least square discriminate analysis (PLS-DA), a supervised extension of principal component analysis, to obtain maximal discrimination between the strains (31Eriksson L. Andersson P.L. Johansson E. Tysklind M. Megavariate analysis of environmental QSAR data. Part I—a basic framework founded on principal component analysis (PCA), partial least squares (PLS), and statistical molecular design (SMD).Mol. Divers. 2006; 10: 169-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Model goodness of fit (R2) and goodness or predictability (Q2) values were determined for each model; the difference between the two values should not exceed 0.2 in a valid model (31Eriksson L. Andersson P.L. Johansson E. Tysklind M. Megavariate analysis of environmental QSAR data. Part I—a basic framework founded on principal component analysis (PCA), partial least squares (PLS), and statistical molecular design (SMD).Mol. Divers. 2006; 10: 169-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Permutation testing was also performed to assess model validity. Individual groups within each model were assessed by performing 999 random permutations of the y variables (strain) while keeping x variables (metabolites) intact. Randomly generated R2 and Q2 values were compared with the original model. Two features indicate that the models are valid. First, no permutations outperformed the original model (all permuted R2 and Q2 values are less than the points on the far right, which represent the original model). Second, the y intercepts for the R2 and Q2 regression line do not exceed 0.4 and 0.05, respectively (31Eriksson L. Andersson P.L. Johansson E. Tysklind M.

https://openalex.org/W2063312765,"Background Liposarcomas are the most common class of soft tissue sarcomas, and myxoid liposarcoma is the second most common liposarcoma. EWSR1-DDIT3 is a chimeric fusion protein generated by the myxoid liposarcoma-specific chromosomal translocation t(12;22)(q13;q12). Current studies indicate that multipotent mesenchymal cells are the origin of sarcomas. The mechanism whereby EWSR1-DDIT3 contributes to the phenotypic selection of target cells during oncogenic transformation remains to be elucidated. Methodology/Principal Findings Reporter assays showed that the EWSR1-DDIT3 myxoid liposarcoma fusion protein, but not its wild-type counterparts EWSR1 and DDIT3, selectively repressed the transcriptional activity of cell lineage-specific marker genes in multipotent mesenchymal C3H10T1/2 cells. Specifically, the osteoblastic marker Opn promoter and chondrocytic marker Col11a2 promoter were repressed, while the adipocytic marker Ppar-γ2 promoter was not affected. Mutation analyses, transient ChIP assays, and treatment of cells with trichostatin A (a potent inhibitor of histone deacetylases) or 5-Aza-2′-deoxycytidine (a methylation-resistant cytosine homolog) revealed the possible molecular mechanisms underlying the above-mentioned selective transcriptional repression. The first is a genetic action of the EWSR1-DDIT3 fusion protein, which results in binding to the functional C/EBP site within Opn and Col11a2 promoters through interaction of its DNA-binding domain and subsequent interference with endogenous C/EBPβ function. Another possible mechanism is an epigenetic action of EWSR1-DDIT3, which enhances histone deacetylation, DNA methylation, and histone H3K9 trimethylation at the transcriptional repression site. We hypothesize that EWSR1-DDIT3-mediated transcriptional regulation may modulate the target cell lineage through target gene-specific genetic and epigenetic conversions. Conclusions/Significance This study elucidates the molecular mechanisms underlying EWSR1-DDIT3 fusion protein-mediated phenotypic selection of putative target multipotent mesenchymal cells during myxoid liposarcoma development. A better understanding of this process is fundamental to the elucidation of possible direct lineage reprogramming in oncogenic sarcoma transformation mediated by fusion proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2101419336,"GABAergic pathways in the brainstem play an essential role in respiratory rhythmogenesis and interactions between the respiratory and cardiovascular neuronal control networks. However, little is known about the identity and function of these GABAergic inhibitory neurons and what determines their activity. In this study we have identified a population of GABAergic neurons in the ventrolateral medulla that receive increased excitatory post-synaptic potentials during inspiration, but also have spontaneous firing in the absence of synaptic input. Using transgenic mice that express GFP under the control of the Gad1 (GAD67) gene promoter, we determined that this population of GABAergic neurons is in close apposition to cardioinhibitory parasympathetic cardiac neurons in the nucleus ambiguus (NA). These neurons fire in synchronization with inspiratory activity. Although they receive excitatory glutamatergic synaptic inputs during inspiration, this excitatory neurotransmission was not altered by blocking nicotinic receptors, and many of these GABAergic neurons continue to fire after synaptic blockade. The spontaneous firing in these GABAergic neurons was not altered by the voltage-gated calcium channel blocker cadmium chloride that blocks both neurotransmission to these neurons and voltage-gated Ca2+ currents, but spontaneous firing was diminished by riluzole, demonstrating a role of persistent sodium channels in the spontaneous firing in these cardiorespiratory GABAergic neurons that possess a pacemaker phenotype. The spontaneously firing GABAergic neurons identified in this study that increase their activity during inspiration would support respiratory rhythm generation if they acted primarily to inhibit post-inspiratory neurons and thereby release inspiration neurons to increase their activity. This population of inspiratory-modulated GABAergic neurons could also play a role in inhibiting neurons that are most active during expiration and provide a framework for respiratory sinus arrhythmia as there is an increase in heart rate during inspiration that occurs via inhibition of premotor parasympathetic cardioinhibitory neurons in the NA during inspiration."
