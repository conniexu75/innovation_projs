https://openalex.org/W4307410401,"Initial efforts to mitigate the COVID-19 pandemic have relied heavily on non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs), including physical distancing, hand hygiene, and mask-wearing. However, an effective vaccine is essential to containing the spread of the virus. We developed a compartmental model to examine different vaccine strategies for controlling the spread of COVID-19. Our framework accounts for testing rates, test-turnaround times, and vaccination waning immunity. Using reported case data from the city of Toronto, Canada between Mar-Dec, 2020 we defined epidemic phases of infection using contact rates as well as the probability of transmission upon contact. We investigated the impact of vaccine distribution by comparing different permutations of waning immunity, vaccine coverage and efficacy throughout various stages of NPI's relaxation in terms of cases and deaths. The basic reproduction number is also studied. We observed that widespread vaccine coverage substantially reduced the number of cases and deaths. Under phases with high transmission, an early or late reopening will result in new resurgence of the infection, even with the highest coverage. On the other hand, under phases with lower transmission, 60% of coverage is enough to prevent new infections. Our analysis of R0 showed that the basic reproduction number is reduced by decreasing the tests turnaround time and transmission in the household. While we found that household transmission can decrease following the introduction of a vaccine, public health efforts to reduce test turnaround times remain important for virus containment."
https://openalex.org/W4307411075,"Antibiotics seize an effect on bacterial composition and diversity and have been demonstrated to induce disruptions on gut microbiomes. This may have implications for human health and wellbeing, and an increasing number of studies suggest a link between the gut microbiome and several diseases. Hence, reducing antibiotic treatments may be beneficial for human health status. Further, antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is an increasing global problem that can be counteracted by limiting the usage of antibiotics. Longer antibiotic treatments have been demonstrated to increase the development of AMR. Therefore, shortening of antibiotic treatment durations, provided it is safe for patients, may be one measure to reduce AMR. In this study, the objective was to investigate effects of standard and reduced antibiotic treatment lengths on gut microbiomes using a murine model. Changes in the murine gut microbiome was assessed after using three different treatment durations of amoxicillin (3, 7 or 14 days) as well as a control group not receiving amoxicillin. Fecal samples were collected before and during the whole experiment, until three weeks past end of treatment. These were further subject for 16S rRNA Illumina MiSeq sequencing. Our results demonstrated significant changes in bacterial diversity, richness and evenness during amoxicillin treatment, followed by a reversion in terms of alpha-diversity and abundance of major phyla, after end of treatment. However, a longer restitution time was indicated for mice receiving amoxicillin for 14 days, and phylum Patescibacteria did not fully recover. In addition, an effect on the composition of Firmicutes was indicated to last for at least three weeks in mice treated with amoxicillin for 14 days. Despite an apparently reversion to a close to original state in overall bacterial diversity and richness, the results suggested more durable changes in lower taxonomical levels. We detected several families, genera and ASVs with significantly altered abundance three weeks after exposure to amoxicillin, as well as bacterial taxa that appeared significantly affected by amoxicillin treatment length. This may strengthen the argument for shorter antibiotic treatment regimens to both limit the emergence of antibiotic resistance and risk of gut microbiome disturbance."
https://openalex.org/W4307441841,"This study examines how broad attitude networks are affected by tailored interventions aimed at variables selected based on their connectiveness with other variables. We first computed a broad attitude network based on a large-scale cross-sectional COVID-19 survey (N = 6,093). Over a period of approximately 10 weeks, participants were invited five times to complete this survey, with the third and fifth wave including interventions aimed at manipulating specific variables in the broad COVID-19 attitude network. Results suggest that targeted interventions that yield relatively strong effects on variables central to a broad attitude network have downstream effects on connected variables, which can be partially explained by the variables the interventions were aimed at. We conclude that broad attitude network structures can reveal important relations between variables that can help to design new interventions."
https://openalex.org/W4307441846,"The COVID-19 pandemic changed school contexts and social opportunities dramatically for adolescents around the world. Thus, certain adolescents may have been more susceptible to the stress of the pandemic as a function of differences in schooling. We present data from 1256 United States adolescents (ages 14-16) to examine how the 2020-2021 school context (in-person, hybrid, or virtual) related to feelings of school satisfaction and success, social connection, mental health, and media use. We also examine differences as a function of gender identity. Results demonstrate that school context, particularly in-person compared to virtual schooling, was related to higher school satisfaction and academic success, stronger feelings of social connection and inclusion, lower levels of anxiety and depression, and less problematic media use. Interestingly, adolescents did seem to use media as a tool to support social connection when in hybrid or virtual school contexts, but they also reported higher rates of problematic media use, thus suggesting that media use needs to be examined more carefully to understand its role as a potential protective mechanism for adolescents' social connection and mental health. These findings provide baseline information about how schools' responses to the COVID-19 pandemic may have created disparities among youth. These findings have implications for current school interventions."
https://openalex.org/W4307441879,"Healthcare professionals had to face numerous challenges during the pandemic, their professional activity being influenced not only by the virus, but also by the spread of medical misinformation. In this regard, we aimed to analyze, from the perspective of medical staff, the way medical and non-medical information about the virus was communicated during the pandemic to encourage the development of future research or interventions in order to raise awareness about the way misinformation affected medical staff.The study was conducted on Romanian healthcare professionals. They were asked to answer to a questionnaire and the sample of the research includes 536 respondents. The findings revealed that most respondents stated that information about alternative treatments against the virus affected the credibility of health professionals, and that younger professionals believed to a greater extent that trust in doctors was affected. The research also showed that respondents were well informed about the drugs used in clinical trials in order to treat the virus.Healthcare professionals declared that the spread of misinformation regarding alternative treatments, affected their credibility and the relationship with their patients. Healthcare professionals had knowledge about the drugs used in clinical trials, and they acknowledged the role of social media in spreading medical misinformation. However, younger professionals also believed that social media could be used to share official information about the virus."
https://openalex.org/W4307410804,"Objectives Feline lower airway disease (FLAD) is a common respiratory condition in cats. Traditionally, response to therapy is monitored only by evaluation of clinical signs and radiographic examination of the lungs. Barometric whole-body plethysmography (BWBP) is considered a non-invasive, well-tolerated form of measuring airway reactivity in cats. The aim of the study was to assess pulmonary function testing by BWBP for non-invasive evaluation of response to therapy in cats with FLAD and to investigate whether BWBP parameters correlate with clinical severity. Material and methods The prospective study included 25 client-owned cats, diagnosed with FLAD on the basis of their medical history, clinical signs, radiographic findings, and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) examination. At three time points (day 0, 14, and 60), a standardised owner questionnaire, a clinical examination and BWBP measurements were carried out. Results of the questionnaire and the clinical examination were evaluated using a clinical 12-point score. Individual therapy was administered to all patients after diagnosis, based on the severity of disease and compliance of the cat. Results The total clinical score significantly improved over the entire study period (p&lt;0.001). Significant improvement was detected for the frequency of coughing (p = 0.009), respiratory distress (p = 0.001), lung auscultation findings (p = 0.002), and general condition and appetite (p = 0.045). The BWBP parameter Penh , an indicator of bronchoconstriction, improved significantly under initial therapy between day 0 and 14 (p = 0.009). A significant correlation between Penh and the severity of auscultation findings was seen on day 0 (r = 0.40; p = 0.013). Conclusion The study supports the role of Penh as a non-invasive parameter for monitoring initial treatment response in cats with FLAD. Further studies are needed to address whether other BWBP parameters might be suitable for non-invasive therapy monitoring of FLAD. Clinical evaluation is always essential in cats with FLAD to evaluate treatment response."
https://openalex.org/W4307411084,"The number of patients with diabetes and impaired fasting blood glucose in Korea is rapidly increasing compared to the past, and other metabolic indicators of population are also changed in recent years. To clarify the mechanism more clearly, we investigated the association between fasting blood glucose and incidence of pancreatic cancer in this retrospective cohort study.In Korea National Health Information Database, 19,050 participants without pancreatic cancer in 2009 were enrolled, and followed up until 2013. We assessed the risk of incident pancreatic cancer according to the quartile groups of fasting blood glucose level (quartile 1: <88 mg/dL, quartile 2: 88-97 mg/dL, quartile 3: 97-109 mg/dL and quartile 4: ≥109 mg/dL). Multivariate Cox-proportional hazard model was used in calculating hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for incident pancreatic cancer.Compared with quartile1 (reference), unadjusted HRs and 95% CI for incident pancreatic cancer significantly increased in order of quartile2 (1.39 [1.01-1.92]), quartile3 (1.50 [1.09-2.07]) and quartile4 (2.18 [1.62-2.95]), and fully adjusted HRs and 95% CI significantly increased from quartile2 (1.47 [1.05-2.04]), quartile3 (1.61 [1.05-2.04]) to quartile4 (2.31 [1.68-3.17]).Fasting blood glucose even with pre-diabetic range was significantly associated with the incident pancreatic cancer in Korean."
https://openalex.org/W4307411246,"Aspergillus flavus is an agriculturally important fungus that causes ear rot of maize and produces aflatoxins, of which B1 is the most carcinogenic naturally-produced compound. In the US, the management of aflatoxins includes the deployment of biological control agents that comprise two nonaflatoxigenic A. flavus strains, either Afla-Guard (member of lineage IB) or AF36 (lineage IC). We used genotyping-by-sequencing to examine the influence of both biocontrol agents on native populations of A. flavus in cornfields in Texas, North Carolina, Arkansas, and Indiana. This study examined up to 27,529 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in a total of 815 A. flavus isolates, and 353 genome-wide haplotypes sampled before biocontrol application, three months after biocontrol application, and up to three years after initial application. Here, we report that the two distinct A. flavus evolutionary lineages IB and IC differ significantly in their frequency distributions across states. We provide evidence of increased unidirectional gene flow from lineage IB into IC, inferred to be due to the applied Afla-Guard biocontrol strain. Genetic exchange and recombination of biocontrol strains with native strains was detected in as little as three months after biocontrol application and up to one and three years later. There was limited inter-lineage migration in the untreated fields. These findings suggest that biocontrol products that include strains from lineage IB offer the greatest potential for sustained reductions in aflatoxin levels over several years. This knowledge has important implications for developing new biocontrol strategies."
https://openalex.org/W4307411278,"Background and objective Low birth weight (LBW) is a major risk factor of child mortality and morbidity during infancy (0–3 years) and early childhood (3–8 years) in low and lower-middle-income countries, including Bangladesh. LBW is a vital public health concern in Bangladesh. The objective of the research was to investigate the socioeconomic inequality in the prevalence of LBW among singleton births and identify the significantly associated determinants of singleton LBW in Bangladesh. Materials and methods The data utilized in this research was derived from the latest nationally representative Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey, 2017–18, and included a total of 2327 respondents. The concentration index (C-index) and concentration curve were used to investigate the socioeconomic inequality in LBW among the singleton newborn babies. Additionally, an adjusted binary logistic regression model was utilized for calculating adjusted odds ratio and p-value (&lt;0.05) to identify the significant determinants of LBW. Results The overall prevalence of LBW among singleton births in Bangladesh was 14.27%. We observed that LBW rates were inequitably distributed across the socioeconomic groups (C-index: -0.096, 95% confidence interval: [-0.175, -0.016], P = 0.029), with a higher concentration of LBW infants among mothers living in the lowest wealth quintile (poorest). Regression analysis revealed that maternal age, region, maternal education level, wealth index, height, age at 1st birth, and the child’s aliveness (alive or died) at the time of the survey were significantly associated determinants of LBW in Bangladesh. Conclusion In this study, socioeconomic disparity in the prevalence of singleton LBW was evident in Bangladesh. Incidence of LBW might be reduced by improving the socioeconomic status of poor families, paying special attention to mothers who have no education and live in low-income households in the eastern divisions (e.g., Sylhet, Chittagong). Governments, agencies, and non-governmental organizations should address the multifaceted issues and implement preventive programs and policies in Bangladesh to reduce LBW."
https://openalex.org/W4307637710,"Recent studies have found a relationship between fear of COVID-19 and mental health problems. Medical workers caring for COVID-19 patients tend to suffer from mental health problems; however, the impact of their personality traits, in the form of mental problems like depression and anxiety in Japan is unclear. In this study, we investigated the risk of nurses' depression and anxiety, predicted by the fear of COVID-19 and the Big Five personality traits. A total of 417 nurses working in hospitals providing care to COVID-19 patients in Wakayama prefecture of the Kansai region participated in this study. The questionnaires comprised items on nurses' basic characteristics and three scales: the Fear of COVID-19 Scale 2020, the Big-Five Scale, and the Japanese version of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). Depression and anxiety in the HADS were set as dependent variables, and basic attributes, fear, and personality traits as independent variables; multivariate logistic regression analyses were conducted. The questionnaire, with no missing items was distributed from February to March 2021. Neuroticism (OR = 1.06, 95%CI = 1.03-1.09) was the only significant factor associated with the depression symptom, and both FCV-19S scores (OR = 1.16, 95%CI = 1.09-1.23) and neuroticism (OR = 1.09, 95%CI = 1.06-1.13) were the significant factors associated with anxiety. The Nagelkerke's R squared was 0.171 in the depression model and 0.366 in the anxiety model. Thus, it was found that it is necessary to support nurses' mental health by developing methods suitable to their personalities."
https://openalex.org/W4307410811,"While the majority of children infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) display mild or no symptoms, rare individuals develop severe disease presenting with multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS-C). The reason for variable clinical manifestations is not understood. Here, we carried out TCR sequencing and conducted comparative analyses of TCR repertoires between children with MIS-C (n = 12) and mild (n = 8) COVID-19. We compared these repertoires with unexposed individuals (samples collected pre-COVID-19 pandemic: n = 8) and with the Adaptive Biotechnologies MIRA dataset, which includes over 135,000 high-confidence SARS-CoV-2-specific TCRs. We show that the repertoires of children with MIS-C are characterised by the expansion of TRBV11-2 chains with high junctional and CDR3 diversity. Moreover, the CDR3 sequences of TRBV11-2 clones shift away from SARS-CoV-2 specific T cell clones, resulting in distorted TCR repertoires. In conclusion, our study reports that CDR3-independent expansion of TRBV11-2+ cells, lacking SARS-CoV-2 specificity, defines MIS-C in children."
https://openalex.org/W4307411079,"The LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) treatment goals recommended by the 2019 ESC/EAS guidelines are only achieved in a minority of patients. The study objective was to estimate the impact of bempedoic acid treatment on LDL-C target attainment, drug costs, and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) events. The simulation used a Monte Carlo approach in a representative cohort of German outpatients at high or very-high cardiovascular risk. Additionally to statins, consecutive treatment with ezetimibe, bempedoic acid, and a PCSK9 inhibitor was simulated in patients not achieving their LDL-C goal. Considered were scenarios without and with bempedoic acid (where bempedoic acid was replaced by a PCSK9 inhibitor when LDL-C was not controlled).The simulation cohort consisted of 105,577 patients, of whom 76,900 had very-high and 28,677 high cardiovascular risk. At baseline, 11.2% of patients achieved their risk-based LDL-C target. Sequential addition of ezetimibe and bempedoic acid resulted in target LDL-C in 33.1% and 61.9%, respectively. Treatment with bempedoic acid reduced the need for a PCSK9 inhibitor from 66.6% to 37.8% and reduced drug costs by 35.9% per year on stable lipid-lowering medication. Compared to using only statins and ezetimibe, this approach is projected to prevent additional 6,148 ASCVD events annually per 1 million patients, whereas PCSK9 inhibition alone would prevent 7,939 additional ASCVD events annually.A considerably larger proportion of cardiovascular high- and very-high-risk patients can achieve guideline-recommended LDL-C goals with escalated lipid-lowering medication. Bempedoic acid is projected to substantially decrease the need for PCSK9 inhibitor treatment to achieve LDL-C targets, associated with reduced drug costs albeit with fewer prevented events."

Design A descriptive and economic retrospective analysis. Setting Medicalized information system program (PMSI), national scale of costs. Patients Female patients operated on to treat adhesions related complications in 2019. Interventions All patients with coded adhesiolysis acts were selected in order to identify the characteristics of Diagnosis related groups (DRG) and compare them with the general DRGs. Then, a sub-analysis on surgery types (laparoscopy or open procedures) was performed to evaluate impact adhesions development and Length of Stay. Lastly, direct costs of adhesions for the healthcare system were quantified based upon adhesiolysis acts coded as main diagnosis. Measurements and main results 26.387 adhesiolysis procedures were listed in France in 2019 through 8 adhesiolysis acts regrouping open surgeries and laparoscopic procedures. Adhesiolysis was coded in up to 34% in some DRGs for laparoscopic procedures. 1551 (1461 studied in our study) surgeries have been realized in 2019 with main procedure: adhesiolysis. These surgeries were associated with an expense of €4 million for the healthcare system for rehospitalizations and reoperations only. Social costs such as sick leaves, drugs and other cares haven’t been taken in consideration. Conclusion Adhesions related complications represent a massive burden for patients and an expensive problem for society. These difficulties may likely to be reduced by a broader use of antiadhesion barriers, at least in some targeted procedures."

While a field experimental approach is widespread, alternative attempts to objectively measure mechanisms of discrimination on the housing market are scarce. In line with labor market research, we stress that to reduce rental discrimination against ethnic minorities, we need understanding its underlying mechanisms. This is the first paper that introduces a vignette experiment to do so. We distinguish between four mechanisms put forward in the literature but hardly ever empirically tested: agent taste-based discrimination, owner taste-based discrimination, neighborhood taste-based discrimination and statistical discrimination, in a multifactorial vignette experiment among 576 pre graduate real estate student. In addition, our experimental design allows us to examine whether unequal treatment is heterogeneous by property owner and neighborhood characteristics."
https://openalex.org/W4307441661,"Sucrose preference (SP) is a widely used measure of anhedonia in rat models of depression, yet depressed patients do not reliably show an analogous deficit. As an alternative affect-related measure, adult rat ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) are attracting interest, but it is unclear whether SP and USVs provide independent measures. Here, we have assessed whether SP and USV emission are correlated in the absence of a depressogenic procedure. To this end, 24 male Long-Evans rats were tested daily for 24 days, with alternating SP tests and USV recordings; after a 3-month hiatus, USV emission was re-evaluated for 6 more days. SP was measured in simultaneous two-bottle choice tests, and USVs were recorded in an open field. The main measures were: SP, 50-kHz call rate, and relative prevalence of trill and flat call subtypes. These measures showed temporally-stable individual differences across the initial 24-day testing period, and at the 3-month USV follow-up tests. Correlational analysis revealed no significant relationships between SP and the three main USV measures. Rats differed consistently, not only in their 50-kHz call rates but also in their 50-kHz call profiles (i.e., the relative prevalence of 14 call subtypes); most rats preferentially emitted either trill or flat calls. Several inter-call subtype associations were detected, including a strong negative relationship between the relative prevalence of flat and trill calls. The 50-kHz call rate was correlated with the relative prevalence of only one call subtype (short calls, negative correlation), but was positively correlated with absolute emission rates for almost all subtypes. In conclusion, adult rats exhibited temporally-stable individual differences over weeks (SP) or months (USVs) of testing. This trait-like stability helped to reveal a lack of relationship between SP and the USV-related variables under study, suggesting that these measures may capture different constructs of possible relevance to animal models of depression."
https://openalex.org/W4307441898,"Environmental stresses, particularly drought, limit symbiotic nitrogen fixation in legumes, resulting in decreased yielding capacity. Drought is one of the most important constraints limiting yield potential in crops and it is the major abiotic stress that can cause more than 70% yield loss in chickpea. In this study, a total of two hundred four chickpea ( Cicer arietinum L.) genotypes were selected to study the interaction between drought stress and nodule formation. This interaction was assessed by using morphological, yield and yield components. The field experiments were laid out in two locations (Terbol and Kfardan stations, Bekaa valley, Lebanon) using Alpha lattice design with two replications and two watering treatments (irrigation and rainfed) during 2016 and 2017 seasons. Parameters that were measured include days to 50% flowering (DFL), day to maturity (DM), plant height (PLH), nodule biomass (NB), nodule fresh weight (NFW), nodule dry weight (NDW), grain yield (GY), Biological yield (BY), 100 seed weight (100SW) and drought tolerance stress (DTS). The results indicated a significant variation between genotypes, environments and other morphological, yield and yield components traits. Drought stress reduced significantly the yield and the nodule’s characteristics, biological and grain yield. The genotypes with the highest levels of drought tolerance, such as IG70399, IG8256, IG71832, IG70270, and IG70272, showed a minimal decrease in yield and nodule biomass. Nodule observations significantly and positively correlated with GY (0.36-0.38) under drought stress treatment. The correlation values for nodule characteristics with DFL and DM were higher under drought stress compared to irrigated conditions. This is a comparative study between drought stress and nodule formation traits associated with morphological, yield and yield components traits."
https://openalex.org/W4286472392,"Extreme weather events, particularly droughts, have strong impacts on the livelihoods of populations in rural areas. In a context of low access to insurance and credit markets, households respond to such shocks by implementing different risk-management strategies, which in turn are likely to have an impact on the environment, in particular through land-use changes and deforestation. This paper contributes to the emerging literature on the links between droughts and deforestation: (1) distinguishing responses to previously experienced droughts versus current droughts, and (2) disentangling the time of the agricultural season at which droughts occur. We show that deforestation declines whenever a drought occurs during the growing season, while it increases whenever a drought occurs during the harvesting season. These impacts are mitigated within protected areas and are exacerbated in more accessible locations, i.e., areas within 4 hours of travel time of main/major cities. By contrast, deforestation outcomes following droughts that occur during the planting season depend on whether the crop considered is maize or cassava."
https://openalex.org/W4307410164,"The aberrant expression of aldo keto reductases (AKR1B1 & AKR1B10) has been extensively studied in different types of cancer especially the colon cancer but a very few studies have yet been reported regarding the discovery of inhibitors for the treatment of colon cancer by targeting these isozymes. Therefore, there is a need of selective inhibitors of both targets for the eradication of colon cancer. Currently, the study is focused on the exploration of two quinolone compounds i.e., (S)-(6-Methoxyquinolin-4-yl)[(1S,2R,4S,5R)-5-vinylquinuclidin-2-yl]methanol (Quinidine) and (R)-(6-Methoxyquinolin-4-yl)[(1S,2S,4S,5R)-5-vinylquinuclidin-2-yl]methanol (Quinine) as the potential inhibitors of AKR1B1 and AKR1B10 via detailed in-silico approach. The structural properties including vibrational frequencies, dipole moment, polarizability and the optimization energies were estimated using density functional theory (DFT) calculations; where both compounds were found chemically reactive. After that, the optimized structures were used for the molecular docking studies and here quinidine was found more selective towards AKR1B1 and quinine exhibited maximum inhibition of AKR1B10. The results of molecular docking studies were validated by molecular dynamics simulations which provided the deep insight of stability of protein ligand complex. At the end, the ADMET properties were determined to demonstrate the druglikeness properties of both selected compounds. These findings suggested further exploration of both compounds at molecular level using different in-vivo and in-vitro approaches that will lead to the designing of potential inhibitor of AKR1B1/AKR1B10 for curing colon cancer and related malignancies."
https://openalex.org/W4307411022,"Introduction Femoro-popliteal bypass with autologous vascular graft is a key revascularization method in chronic limb-threatening ischemia (CLTI). However, the lack of suitable autologous conduit may occur in 15–45% of the patients, necessitating the implantation of prosthetic or allogen grafts. Only little data is available on the outcome of allograft use in CLTI. Aims Our objective were to evaluate the long term results of infrainguinal allograft bypass surgery in patients with chronic limb-threatening ischemia (CLTI) and compare the results of arterial and venous allografts. Methods Single center, retrospective study analysing the outcomes of infrainguinal allograft bypass surgery in patients with CLTI between January 2007 and December 2017. Results During a 11-year period, 134 infrainguinal allograft bypasses were performed for CLTI [91 males (67.9%)]. Great saphenous vein (GSV) was implanted in 100 cases, superficial femoral artery (SFA) was implanted in 34 cases. Early postoperative complications appeared in 16.4% of cases and perioperative mortality (&lt;30 days) was 1.4%. Primary patency at one, three and five years was 59%, 44% and 41%, respectively, while secondary patency was 60%, 45% and 41%, respectively. Primary patency of the SFA allografts was significantly higher than GSV allografts (1 year: SFA: 84% vs. GSV: 51% p = 0,001; 3 years: SFA: 76% vs. GSV: 32% p = 0,001; 5 years: SFA: 71% vs. GSV: 30% p = 0.001). Both primary and secondary patency of SFA allograft implanted in below-knee position were significantly higher than GSV bypasses (p = 0.0006; p = 0.0005, respectively). Limb salvage at one, three and five years following surgery was 74%, 64% and 62%, respectively. Long-term survival was 53% at 5 years. Conclusion Allograft implantation is a suitable method for limb salvage in CLTI. The patency of arterial allograft is better than venous allograft patency, especially in below-knee position during infrainguinal allograft bypass surgery."

https://openalex.org/W4307411078,"Introduction Children infected with COVID-19 are susceptible to severe manifestations. We aimed to develop and validate a predictive model for severe/ critical pediatric COVID-19 infection utilizing routinely available hospital level data to ascertain the likelihood of developing severe manifestations. Methods The predictive model was based on an analysis of registry data from COVID-19 positive patients admitted to five tertiary pediatric hospitals across Asia [Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia (two centers) and Pakistan]. Independent predictors of severe/critical COVID-19 infection were determined using multivariable logistic regression. A training cohort (n = 802, 70%) was used to develop the prediction model which was then validated in a test cohort (n = 345, 30%). The discriminative ability and performance of this model was assessed by calculating the Area Under the Curve (AUC) and 95% confidence interval (CI) from final Receiver Operating Characteristics Curve (ROC). Results A total of 1147 patients were included in this analysis. In the multivariable model, infant age group, presence of comorbidities, fever, vomiting, seizures and higher absolute neutrophil count were associated with an increased risk of developing severe/critical COVID-19 infection. The presence of coryza at presentation, higher hemoglobin and platelet count were associated with a decreased risk of severe/critical COVID-19 infection. The AUC (95%CI) generated for this model from the training and validation cohort were 0.96 (0.94, 0.98) and 0.92 (0.86, 0.97), respectively. Conclusion This predictive model using clinical history and commonly used laboratory values was valuable in estimating the risk of developing a severe/critical COVID-19 infection in hospitalized children. Further validation is needed to provide more insights into its utility in clinical practice."

To better examine the influence of MG during prion infection, we reduced MG in the brains of C57BL/10 mice using PLX5622 and assessed prion clearance and replication using multiple approaches that included bioassay, immunohistochemistry, and Real-Time Quaking Inducted Conversion (RT-QuIC). We also utilized a strategy of intermittent PLX5622 treatments to reduce MG and allow MG repopulation to test whether new MG could alter prion disease progress. Lastly, we investigated the influence of MG using tga20 mice, a rapid prion model that accumulates fewer pathological features and less PrPres in the infected brain. In C57BL/10 mice we found that MG were excluded from the inoculation site early after infection, but Iba1 positive infiltrating monocytes/macrophage were present. Reducing MG in the brain prior to prion inoculation did not increase susceptibility to prion infection. Short intermittent treatments with PLX5622 in prion infected C57BL/10 mice after 80 dpi were unsuccessful at altering the MG population, gliosis, or survival. Additionally, MG depletion using PLX5622 in tga20 mice had only a minor impact on prion pathogenesis, indicating that the presence of MG might be less important in this fast model with less prion accumulation. In contrast to the benefits of MG against prion disease in late stages of disease, our current experiments suggest MG do not play a role in early prion pathogenesis, clearance, or replication."
https://openalex.org/W4307411232,"In a published randomized controlled trial, household units were randomized to a nutrient bar supplementation group or a control condition, but the non-independence of observations within the same household (i.e., the clustering effect) was not accounted for in the statistical analyses. Therefore, we reanalyzed the data appropriately by adjusting degrees of freedom using the between-within method, and accounting for household units using linear mixed effect models with random intercepts for family units and subjects nested within family units for each reported outcome. Results from this reanalysis showed that ignoring the clustering and nesting effects in the original analyses had resulted in anticonservative (i.e., too small) time x group interaction p-values. Still, majority of the conclusions remained unchanged."
https://openalex.org/W4307412560,"Background Ventricular septal rupture (VSR) is a rare complication after acute myocardial infarction (AMI) especially in the reperfusion era but its associated mortality has remained high. This case series evaluated in-hospital and intermediate-term mortality in VSR patients. Additionally, we also analyzed risk factors, clinical presentation, intervention, and predictors of in-hospital mortality in VSR patients. Methods Data of 67 patients with echocardiography confirmed diagnosis of VSR from January 2011 to April 2020 was extracted from hospital medical records. Records were also reviewed to document 30 day and 1-year mortality, recurrent heart failure admission, repeat myocardial infarction, and revascularization. In addition, telephonic follow-up was done to assess health-related quality of life(HRQOL) assessed by KCCQ-12. SCAI shock classification was used to categorize severity of cardiogenic shock. Univariate and multivariable logistic regression was used to determine predictors of in-hospital mortality. Survival function was presented using the Kaplan-Meier survival curve. Results Mean age of patients was 62.7 ± 11.1 years, 62.7% were males. 65.7% of the patients presented more than 24 hours after MI and did not receive reperfusion therapy. Median time from AMI to VSR diagnosis was 2 (1–5) days. VSR closure was attempted in 53.7% patients. In-hospital mortality was 65.7%. At univariate level, predictors of in-hospital mortality were non-surgical management, basal VSR, right ventricular dysfunction, early VSR post-MI, and severe cardiogenic shock at admission (class C, D, or E). Adjusted predictors of in-hospital mortality included non-surgical management, basal VSR and advanced cardiogenic shock. There were 5 deaths during median followup of 44.1 months. HRQOL in patients available on followup was good (54.5%) or excellent (45.5%). Conclusion High in-hospital mortality was seen in VSR patients. VSR closure is the preferred treatment to get long-term survival, however, timing of repair as well as severity of cardiogenic shock plays a significant role in determining prognosis."
https://openalex.org/W4307412596,"The anonymity that the internet and social media affords users means that suicidal thoughts and/or behaviours can be talked about with a sense of freedom and disinhibition that is often not possible in face-to-face contexts. Better understanding online suicidal thoughts and/or behaviour talk is critical as more people turn to online spaces for support. Without this the potentiality of such spaces as sites for suicide prevention and intervention is likely to remain unrealised. Currently there are no scoping or systematic review syntheses focusing on internet and/or on social media suicidal thoughts and/or behaviour talk. This lack of synthesis is problematic as it makes it more difficult for online suicide prevention and intervention practices, policies, and our understanding of suicide to advance in a coherent and evidence-based manner. A scoping review protocol following Arksey and O'Malley's six-step modified framework has been developed to address this synthesis gap. It aims to systematically map the empirical literature that has investigated online suicidal thoughts and/or behaviours talk. It is anticipated that review outcomes could inform the training of health practitioners and peer/professional online moderators in how to best talk with people experiencing suicidal thoughts and/or behaviours. Outcomes could also form an evidence-base for developing policies and practices that focus on online places as safe spaces to talk about suicidal thoughts and/or behaviours. Developers of safe language guidelines could also use the outcomes to audit how well current guidelines reflect empirical evidence. Outcomes could enable researchers to design future online suicidal thoughts and/behaviours talk studies that extend our understandings of suicide leading to potential refinements of contemporary suicide theories/models."
https://openalex.org/W4307412752,"The design of deep convolutional neural networks has resulted in significant advances and successes in the field of object detection. However, despite these achievements, the high computational and memory costs of such object detection networks on the edge or in mobile scenarios are one of the most significant barriers to their broad adoption. To solve this problem, this paper introduces an improved lightweight real-time convolutional neural network based on YOLOv5, called Alpha-SGANet: A multi-attention-scale feature pyramid network combined with a lightweight network based on Alpha-IoU loss. Firstly, we add one more prediction head to detect different-scale objects, design a lightweight and efficient feature extraction network using ShuffleNetV2 in the backbone, and reduce information loss using the SPP module with a smaller convolutional nucleus. Then, cleverly, employ GAFPN to improve feature transition processing in the neck region, including the usage of the Ghost module to construct efficient feature maps to help prediction. The CBAM module was further integrated to find areas of interest in the scene; finally, combined with Alpha-IOU loss for model supervision training, the biggest performance improvement was achieved. The experiment results show that, compared with YOLOv5s, our proposed method can achieve higher accuracy with fewer parameters and has real-time speed through verification on the PASCAL VOC dataset and MS COCO dataset."
https://openalex.org/W4307441384,"The COVID-19 pandemic has posed unique academic, social, financial, and health-related challenges for young adults. While numerous studies have documented average increases in reported mental health issues in the general population, few have measured the magnitude of changes in mental health symptoms and sleep difficulties within individuals. Here, we measure the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health and sleep of university students pre- and mid-pandemic. Prior to the pandemic (Fall 2019), individuals (n = 23) were recruited to participate in an eight-day, comprehensive sleep study using Fitbit® actigraphy. Participants also completed detailed mental health and sleep surveys, including depression (BDI-II), anxiety (STAI), and sleep disturbance (PROMIS) surveys. One year later, these individuals repeated the study during the pandemic (Fall 2020); participants completed the original surveys and sleep study, in addition to a targeted survey on mental and sleep health due to the pandemic. Self-reported levels of anxiety, depression, and sleep disturbance, and sleep parameters, measured by actigraphy, were compared within the same individuals pre- and mid-pandemic. Self-report survey data revealed that three-quarters of participants experienced an increase in stress and anxiety due to the pandemic. In addition, intra-individual depression and anxiety symptoms increased to clinically significant levels within individuals from pre- to mid-pandemic. Over two-thirds of participants reported sleeping less, and more than half reported that their sleep health had worsened during the pandemic. Changes in sleep disturbance were positively associated with changes in depression and anxiety, reinforcing the robust relationship between poor sleep quality and mental health. Furthermore, individuals who reported greater sleep disturbance during the pandemic experienced lower relative proportions of both REM and deep sleep. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on university students is multi-faceted-mental health, sleep quality, and the amount of restorative sleep are negatively affected by the pandemic environment. These compounded effects exacerbate the health consequences of the pandemic and highlight a need for increased attention to the prevention and treatment of mental health disorders, particularly in vulnerable populations of young adults."
https://openalex.org/W4307441840,"During the COVID-19 pandemic, digital contact-tracing has been employed in many countries to monitor and manage the spread of the disease. However, to be effective such a system must be adopted by a substantial proportion of the population; therefore, public trust plays a key role. This paper examines the NHS COVID-19 smartphone app, the digital contact-tracing solution in the UK. A series of interviews were carried out prior to the app’s release (n = 12) and a large scale survey examining attitudes towards the app (n = 1,001) was carried out after release. Extending previous work reporting high level attitudes towards the app, this paper shows that prevailing negative attitudes prior to release persisted, and affected the subsequent use of the app. They also show significant relationships between trust, app features, and the wider social and societal context. There is lower trust amongst non-users of the app and trust correlates to many other aspects of the app, a lack of trust could hinder adoption and effectiveness of digital contact-tracing. The design of technology requiring wide uptake, e.g., for public health, should embed considerations of the complexities of trust and the context in which the technology will be used."
https://openalex.org/W4307441847,"The surrounding rock at the exit of the No. 1 drainage tunnel of the Artashi Water Conservancy Project is micritic bioclastic limestone with 55% bioclastic material. This rock underwent unpredictable large and time-dependent deformation during excavation. To date, the mechanical behaviour of this kind of rock has rarely been studied. In this study, traditional triaxial compression tests and multilevel creep tests were conducted on micritic bioclastic limestone, and the results clarified the instantaneous and time-dependent mechanical properties of the rock. Considering that the essence of rock failure is crack growth, the crack strain evolution properties were revealed in rock triaxial compression tests and multilevel creep tests. Based on triaxial compression tests, the evolution of axial cracks with increasing deviatoric stress ratio R d (ratio of deviatoric stress to peak deviatoric stress) was observed, and an axial crack closure element and new crack growth element were proposed. To simulate the creep behaviour of a rock specimen, the relationship of the rock creep crack strain rate with R d was studied. A creep crack element was created, and the creep crack strain evolution equation was obtained, which closely fit the experimental data. Combining the 4 element types (elastic element, crack closure element, crack growth element, and creep crack element), a unified transient creep constitutive model (Mo’s model) was proposed, which represented both the transient and time-dependent mechanical properties of the micritic bioclastic limestone."
https://openalex.org/W4307441899,"The global health crisis due to the fast spread of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) has caused great danger to all aspects of healthcare, economy, and other aspects. The highly infectious and insidious nature of the new coronavirus greatly increases the difficulty of outbreak prevention and control. The early and rapid detection of Covid-19 is an effective way to reduce the spread of Covid-19. However, detecting Covid-19 accurately and quickly in large populations remains to be a major challenge worldwide. In this study, A CNN-transformer fusion framework is proposed for the automatic classification of pneumonia on chest X-ray. This framework includes two parts: data processing and image classification. The data processing stage is to eliminate the differences between data from different medical institutions so that they have the same storage format; in the image classification stage, we use a multi-branch network with a custom convolution module and a transformer module, including feature extraction, feature focus, and feature classification sub-networks. Feature extraction subnetworks extract the shallow features of the image and interact with the information through the convolution and transformer modules. Both the local and global features are extracted by the convolution module and transformer module of feature-focus subnetworks, and are classified by the feature classification subnetworks. The proposed network could decide whether or not a patient has pneumonia, and differentiate between Covid-19 and bacterial pneumonia. This network was implemented on the collected benchmark datasets and the result shows that accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score are 97.09%, 97.16%, 96.93%, and 97.04%, respectively. Our network was compared with other researchers’ proposed methods and achieved better results in terms of accuracy, precision, and F1 score, proving that it is superior for Covid-19 detection. With further improvements to this network, we hope that it will provide doctors with an effective tool for diagnosing Covid-19."
https://openalex.org/W4307449500,"Roadway multi-fatality crashes have always been a vital issue for traffic safety. This study aims to explore the contributory factors and interdependent characteristics of multi-fatality crashes using a novel framework combining association rules mining and rules graph structures. A case study is conducted using data from 1068 severe fatal crashes in China from 2015 to 2020, and 1452 interesting rules are generated using an association rule mining approach. Several modular rules graph structures are constructed based on graph theory to reflect the interactions and patterns between different variables. The results indicate that multi-fatality crashes are highly associated with improper operations, passenger overload, fewer lanes, mountainous terrain, and run-off-the-road crashes, representing the key variables of factors concerning driver, vehicle, road, environment, and accident, respectively. Furthermore, crashes involving different severity levels, road categories, and terrain are verified to possess unique association rules and independent crash patterns. Moreover, the proportion of severe crashes caused by a combination of human-vehicle-road-environment factors (43%) is much higher than that of normal crashes (3%). This study reveals that the hidden associations between various factors contribute to the overrepresentation and severity of multi-fatality crashes. It also demonstrates that the crash mechanisms involving multi-fatality crashes and their interactions are more complex at the system level than those for normal crashes. The proposed framework can effectively map the intrinsic link between multiple crash factors and potential risks, providing transportation agencies with helpful insights for targeted safety measures and preventive strategies."
https://openalex.org/W4307410308,"Healthcare workers and nonclinical staff in medical facilities are perceived to be a high-risk group for acquiring SAR-CoV-2 infection, and more so in countries where COVID-19 vaccination uptake is low. Serosurveillance may best determine the true extent of SARS-CoV-2 infection since most infected HCWs and other staff may be asymptomatic or present with only mild symptoms. Over time, determining the true extent of SARS-CoV-2 infection could inform hospital management and staff whether the preventive measures instituted are effective and valuable in developing targeted solutions.This was a census survey study conducted at the Aga Khan University Hospital, Nairobi, between November 2020 and February 2021 before the implementation of the COVID-19 vaccination. The SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid IgG test was performed using a chemiluminescent assay.One thousand six hundred thirty-one (1631) staff enrolled, totalling 60% of the workforce. The overall crude seroprevalence was 18.4% and the adjusted value (for assay sensitivity of 86%) was 21.4% (95% CI; 19.2-23.7). The staff categories with higher prevalence included pharmacy (25.6%), outreach (24%), hospital- based nursing (22.2%) and catering staff (22.6%). Independent predictors of a positive IgG result after adjusting for age, sex and comorbidities included prior COVID-19 like symptoms, odds ratio (OR) 2.0 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.3-3.0, p = 0.001], a prior positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR result OR 12.0 (CI: 7.7-18.7, p<0.001) and working in a clinical COVID-19 designated area, OR 1.9 (CI 1.1-3.3, p = 0.021). The odds of testing positive for IgG after a positive PCR test were lowest if the antibody test was performed more than 2 months later; OR 0.7 (CI: 0.48-0.95, p = 0.025).The prevalence of anti- SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid IgG among HCWs and nonclinical staff was lower than in the general population. Staff working in clinical areas were not at increased risk when compared to staff working in non-clinical areas."
https://openalex.org/W4307410310,"Mobility is the key factor in promoting tourism economic growth (TEG), and the transportation infrastructure has essential functions for maintaining an orderly flow of tourists. Based on the theory of fluid mechanics, we put forward the indicator of tourism mobility (TM). This study is the first to measure the level of TM in China and analyze the spatiotemporal evolution characteristics of TM. Applying the Exploratory Spatial Data Analysis method, we analyze the global and local spatial correlation characteristics of TM. Moreover, we further estimate the contribution of TM to TEG by econometric models and the LMDI method. The results show that (1) the TM in China has maintained rapid growth for a long time. However, there are differences in the rate of growth in different regions. The TM in each region only showed a significant positive spatial correlation in 2016–2018. The space-time pattern is constantly changing over time. The local spatial autocorrelation results of TM are stable, and various agglomeration states are stably distributed in some provinces. (2) The regression results of the traditional panel data model and spatial panel data model both show that TM has a significant positive effect on TEG. Moreover, TM has a negative spatial spillover effect on neighboring regions. (3) The result from the decomposition of LMDI shows that the overall contribution of TM to TEG is 15.76%. This shows that improving TM is a crucial way to promote the economic growth of tourism."
https://openalex.org/W4307410399,"Background Home birth preference is the need of pregnant women to give birth at their home with the help of traditional (unskilled) birth attendants. Homebirth with unskilled birth attendants during childbirth is the main leading indicator for maternal and newborn death. In Ethiopia, numbers of women prefer homebirth which is assisted by unskilled personal. However, there is no information regarding the problem in the Arba Minch zuria woreda. Therefore, it is important to identify prevalence of preference of homebirth and associated factors. Objectives This study aimed to assess the preference of home birth and associated factors among pregnant women in Arba Minch health and demographic surveillance site. Method and materials A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted among pregnant women in Arba Minch health and demographic surveillance site, from May 1 to June 1, 2021. Using simple random sampling technique, 416 study samples were selected. Data were collected by interviewer-administered questionnaire. Data were coded and entered into Epi-Data version 4.4.2.1 computer software and exported to Statistical Package for Social Sciences software version 25 for analysis. Bi-variable binary logistic regression for the selection of potential candidate variables at p-value &lt; 0.25 for multivariable analysis and multivariable binary logistic regression to identify the association between homebirth preference and independent variables were carried out. The level of statistical significance was declared at a p-value &lt; 0.05. Result In this study, in Arba Minch demographic health surveillance site, the prevalence of preference of pregnant women to give birth at their home was 24% [95%CI: (19.9%-28.2%)] The factors significantly associated with the preference of home birth were husband involvement in decision making [AOR: 0.14 (0.05–0.38)], no access of road for transportation [AOR: 2.4 (1.2–5.18)], not heard about the benefit of institutional birth [AOR: 5.3 (2.3–12.2)], poor knowledge about danger signs [AOR: 3 (1.16–7.6)], negative attitude toward services [AOR: 3.1 (1.19–8.02)], and high fear to give birth at institution [AOR: 5.12 (2.4–10.91)]. Conclusions In Arba Minch demographic health surveillance site, the prevalence of preference of pregnant women to give birth at their home was 24%. Husband involvement in decision making, no access of road for transportation, not heard about the benefit of institutional birth, poor knowledge about danger signs, negative attitude toward services, and high fear to give birth at health institutions were factors significantly associated with the preference of home birth."
https://openalex.org/W4307410667,"Individuals with high fatigue resistance against a high-intensity conditioning activity (CA) may be able to avoid experiencing significant fatigue and enhance their voluntary performance. We examined whether the optimal contraction duration of dynamic knee extension exercises to maximize subsequent voluntary performance varies depending on the strength level of an individual. The study participants were 22 male American college football players. Initially, all participants performed a 10-s maximal isometric knee extension exercise and were classified as stronger individuals (n = 8) and weaker individuals (n = 8) based on their relative muscle strength. Each group then performed three types of dynamic CA with different contraction durations (6 s [6-CA], 12 s [12-CA], and 18 s [18-CA]) in random order. To observe the time-course changes in post-activation potentiation and performance enhancement, the twitch torques induced by electrical stimulation and isokinetic knee extension torques at 180°/s were recorded before and after each CA. The twitch torque increased at 10 s (29.5% ± 9.3%) and 1 min (18.5% ± 6.8%) after 6-CA for the stronger individuals (p < 0.05). However, no post-activation potentiation was induced in the weaker individuals in either protocol. Voluntary performance increased at 4 (7.0% ± 4.5%) and 7 (8.2% ± 4.3%) min after 18-CA for stronger individuals (p < 0.05). However, there was no post-activation performance enhancement in either protocol for weaker individuals. Thus, CA with a relatively long contraction duration was optimal to maximize the subsequent voluntary performance for stronger individuals. It remains unknown whether CAs performed with relatively short or long contraction durations were optimal for weaker individuals."

LADs, LSSPs and MRPV were identified by two radiologists on a dedicated workstation using multiplanar reconstructions and volume rendering technique. Univariate and bivariate regression analyses with patient demographics and cardiovascular risk factors as covariates were performed to reveal independent factors associated with rAF.LADs were recorded in 41 patients (29%), LSSPs in 20 (14%) and MRPVs in 15 (11%). The right anterosuperior wall of the left atrium was the most prevalent location of LADs (68%). rAF occured in 20 patients, thereof, 15 exhibited an outpouching structure of the left atrium (LAD: 9, LSSP: 2 and MRPV: 3). Presence of an LAD (HR: 2.7, 95%CI: 1.0-8.4, p = 0.04) and permanent AF (HR: 4.8, 95%CI: 1.5-16.3, p = 0.01) were independently associated with rAF.LAD, LSSP and MRPV were common findings on pre-procedural cardiac computed tomography. LADs were revealed as potential independent risk factor of rAF, which might be considered for treatment planning and post-treatment observation."
https://openalex.org/W4307411077,"Specific collagens and insoluble proteins called cuticlins are major constituents of the nematode cuticles. The epicuticle, which forms the outermost electron-dense layer of the cuticle, is composed of another category of insoluble proteins called epicuticlins. It is distinct from the insoluble cuticlins localized in the cortical layer and the fibrous ribbon underneath lateral alae. Our objective was to identify and characterize genes and their encoded proteins forming the epicuticle. The combination between previously obtained laboratory results and recently made available data through the whole-genome shotgun contigs (WGS) and the transcriptome Shotgun Assembly (TSA) sequencing projects of Ascaris suum allowed us to identify the first epicuticlin gene, Asu-epic-1, on the chromosome VI. This gene is formed of exon1 (55 bp) and exon2 (1067 bp), separated by an intron of 1593 bp. Exon 2 is formed of tandem repeats (TR) whose number varies in different cDNA and genomic clones of Asu-epic-1. These variations could be due to slippage of the polymerases during DNA replication and RNA transcription leading to insertions and deletions (Indels). The deduced protein, Asu-EPIC-1, consists of a signal peptide of 20 amino acids followed by 353 amino acids composed of seven TR of 49 or 51 amino acids each. Three highly conserved tyrosine motifs characterize each repeat. The GYR motif is the Pfam motif PF02756 present in several cuticular proteins of arthropods. Asu-EPIC-1 is an intrinsically disordered protein (IDP) containing seven predicted molecular recognition features (MoRFs). This type of protein undergoes a disorder-to-order transition upon binding protein partners. Three epicuticular sequences have been identified in A. suum, Ascaris lumbricoides, and Toxocara canis. Homologous epicuticular proteins were identified in over 50 other nematode species. The potential of this new category of proteins in forming the nematode cuticle through covalent interactions with other cuticular components, particularly with collagens, is discussed. Their localization in the outermost layer of the nematode body and their unique structure render them crucial candidates for biochemical and molecular interaction studies and targets for new biotechnological and biomedical applications."

Objective We aimed to investigate the local gene expression of selected proinflammatory mediators in patients with PD and correlated our data with patients`pain phenotype. Methods We recruited 30 patients with PD and 30 healthy controls. Pain intensity of patients was assessed using the Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) and patients were stratified into PD pain (NRS≥4) and PD No Pain (NRS&lt;4) subgroups. Skin punch biopsies were immunoassayed for protein-gene product 9.5 as a pan-neuronal marker and intraepidermal nerve fiber density (IEFND). Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) analysis was performed to assess the gene expression of inflammatory mediators in the skin compared to controls. Results Patients with PD had lower distal IENFD compared to healthy controls. In skin samples, IL-2 (p&lt;0.001) and TNF-α (p&lt;0.01) were expressed higher in PD patients compared to controls. IL-1β (p&lt;0.05) was expressed higher in the PD pain group compared to healthy controls. PD patients with pain receiving analgesics had a lower expression of TNF-α (p&lt;0.05) in the skin compared to those not receiving treatment. Conclusions Our data suggest the occurrence of a local, peripheral inflammatory response in the skin in PD, but do not support this being a relevant factor contributing to pain in PD."
https://openalex.org/W4307411235,"The purpose of a rock bolt is to improve the strength capacity of a jointed rock mass. The strengthened arch controlling area can be formed based on the superposition of the controlling influence range of the bolt with the controlling influence angle of rock bolt playing an important role. However, quantitative research on the influence angle is still rare. In this study, numerical simulations and mathematical analysis are used to study the law of stress field distribution and the controlling influence angle through a single bolt, and the following conclusions can be obtained. (1) The compressive stress field is roughly distributed in an ""Apple shape"" and in a ""conical"" spatial distribution. (2) The bolt controlling angle is not a constant 45°, and it is influenced by the rock mass strength and bolt parameters. It decreases with the increasing elastic modulus of the bolt, bolt diameter and bolt length. It also increases with the increasing pretension and rock mass strength. The length has less influence on the supporting range. (3) Based on the experimental results, an optimal analytical model to predict the bolt's controlling influence angle was developed. The analytical model includes the influences of the rock mass strength and bolt parameters. (4) A comparison between the model predictions with the results from the Dabei Mining 103 face transportation tunnel and the existing results shows the rationale behind the original support design scheme and an improvement over the existing results."

These changes have posed some relevant questions among oral health professionals regarding the understanding and attitudes of dental patients toward COVID-19. This study aimed to assess the knowledge, attitude, and practices of dental patients in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania.This cross-sectional study was carried out in 4 public hospitals in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania involving 472 adult patients. Data were collected using a questionnaire that had a set of questions regarding knowledge, attitude, and practices (KAP) related to COVID-19. Data were analyzed using the SPSS computer software version 26. For descriptive analysis means, standard error of the mean, and proportion were used. Multivariate regression analysis was utilized for the response analysis. Alpha of less than 0.05 was considered to indicate statistical significance.Good levels of knowledge, attitude, and practices related to COVID-19 were found in 76.5%, 74.8%, and 58.1% of participants respectively. On performing multivariate analysis, odds of having good knowledge regarding COVID-19 were almost 2 folds higher in participants who were females, with high education levels, those without partners, and those with stable income. Females were 1.5 folds more likely to have a good attitude toward COVID-19 and odds of good practice against COVID-19 were 3 folds higher in young adults compared to the elderly.A majority of dental patients have good knowledge and attitude related to COVID-19. Predictors of good knowledge were sex, education level, marital status, and income of the participants. Sex predicted good attitude and age predicted good practice."
https://openalex.org/W4307412597,"Male mice with homozygous loss of function mutations of the transcription factor gene Pea3 (Pea3 null) are infertile due to their inability to inseminate females, however the specific deficits in male sexual behaviors that drive this phenotype are unknown. Here, the copulatory behavior of male mice (Pea3 null and control) with hormonally primed ovariectomized females was monitored via high-speed and high-resolution digital videography to assess for differences in female-directed social behaviors, gross sexual behaviors (mounting, thrusting), and erectile and ejaculatory function. Pea3 null male mice exhibit greatly reduced erectile function, with 44% of males displaying no visible erections during copulation, and 0% achieving sustained erections. As such, Pea3 null males are incapable of intromission and copulatory plug deposition, despite displaying largely normal female-directed social behaviors, mounting behaviors, and ejaculatory grasping behavior. Additionally, the organization and timing of thrusting behaviors is impaired in Pea3 null males. Our results show that the transcription factor gene Pea3 regulates the ability to achieve and maintain erections during copulation in mice."
https://openalex.org/W4307412598,"At present, ginkgo nut shellers have many problems, such as low shelling rate and high damage rate. To address these problems, a multifunctional ginkgo nut sheller was designed. The equipment had functions for shell breaking, shelling, and separation of shell from the kernel. The influencing factors of the shelling process were analyzed. A three-factor two-level response surface test was conducted, and mathematical models for the response surface were established. The influence of each factor on the operation quality was analyzed, and a combination of parameters was optimized. The experimental results showed that the factors in the order of importance of their influence on shelling rate was as follows: feeding rate, chainplate speed, and shelling gap. The factors in the order of importance of their influence on damage rate was as follows: shelling gap, chainplate speed, and feeding rate. The results of the interaction analysis conducted showed that the interaction between the chainplate speed and shelling gap had the highest significant effect on the shelling rate, followed by the interaction between the feeding rate and chainplate speed. The interaction between the chainplate speed and shelling gap had a significant effect on damage rate. The interaction between the other factors had no significant effect on shelling and damage rates. The optimal combination of parameters was as follows: the feeding rate was 30.2 g/s, the chainplate speed was 0.48 m/s, and the shelling gap was 12.3 mm. The optimal combination was employed, and the validation test resulted in a shelling rate of 98.02% and damage rate of 4.45%. The relative error between the measured and theoretical values was less than 5%, indicating that the models were reliable. This study can provide a reference for subsequent research on shelling equipment of ginkgo nut."
https://openalex.org/W4307412601,"Although many dietary and lifestyle interventions have been proposed, the concept of total dietary replacement (TDR) to achieve remission of type 2 diabetes in the Gulf region is new. With the high levels of obesity and type 2 diabetes in the region, offering TDR to patients for weight loss and remission of type 2 diabetes would assist in achieving health outcomes. The aim of the current study was to explore and understand remission of type 2 diabetes and TDR from the perspectives of dietitians to identify challenges and recommend solutions for implementation in Kuwait. A qualitative approach utilizing focus groups was chosen to explore the topic. Purposive sampling was used to gain experiences from a diverse sample across primary, secondary, and tertiary specialized diabetes centers. Discussions were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. Grounded theory using an iterative approach was applied to analyze the data. Three focus groups with a total of 17 participants achieved data saturation. The sample was varied in terms of workplace and years of experience. The three emerging themes were motivation to use the TDR approach, perceived challenges of TDR, and suggestions to improve and adapt approaches for Kuwait. Dietitians reported that remission of type 2 diabetes is a great motivator for patients to undergo TDR, although various factors were identified that may affect uptake including age, level of education, and social and cultural environment. By understanding dietitians' perspectives, it has provided insight on views regarding the implementation of TDR to achieve remission in Kuwait and how best to tailor approaches by focusing on patient support needs and adopting a flexible approach."
https://openalex.org/W4307412620,"Whether nature is valuable on its own (intrinsic values) or because of the benefits it provides to humans (instrumental values) has been a long-standing debate. The concept of relational values has been proposed as a solution to this supposed dichotomy, but the empirical validation of its intuitiveness remains limited. We experimentally assessed whether intrinsic/relational values of sentient beings/non-sentient beings/ecosystems better explain people's sense of moral duty towards global nature conservation for the future. Participants from a representative sample of the population of Singapore (n = 1508) were randomly allocated to two ""the last human"" scenarios. We found that the best predictor of such a sense of moral duty for future nature conservation is the recognition of the intrinsic values of sentient beings. Our results suggest that the concern for animal welfare may enhance rather than compete with the sense of moral duty towards nature conservation."
https://openalex.org/W4307412625,"Plasma fibrinogen and albumin concentrations initially decrease after abdominal surgery. On postoperative days 3–5 fibrinogen concentration returns to the preoperative level or even higher, while albumin stays low. It is not known if these altered plasma concentrations reflect changes in synthesis rate, utilization, or both. In particular a low albumin plasma concentration has often been attributed to a low synthesis rate, which is not always the case. The objective of this study was to determine fibrinogen and albumin quantitative synthesis rates in patients undergoing major upper abdominal surgery with and without intact liver size. Patients undergoing liver or pancreatic resection (n = 9+6) were studied preoperatively, on postoperative days 1 and 3–5. De novo synthesis of fibrinogen and albumin was determined; in addition, several biomarkers indicative of fibrinogen utilization were monitored. After hemihepatectomy, fibrinogen synthesis was 2-3-fold higher on postoperative day 1 than preoperatively. On postoperative days 3–5 the synthesis level was still higher than preoperatively. Following major liver resections albumin synthesis was not altered postoperatively compared to preoperative values. After pancreatic resection, on postoperative day 1 fibrinogen synthesis was 5-6-fold higher than preoperatively and albumin synthesis 1.5-fold higher. On postoperative days 3–5, synthesis levels returned to preoperative levels. Despite decreases in plasma concentrations, de novo synthesis of fibrinogen was markedly stimulated on postoperative day 1 after both hemihepatectomies and pancreatectomies, while de novo albumin synthesis remained grossly unchanged. The less pronounced changes seen following hepatectomies were possibly related to the loss of liver tissue."
https://openalex.org/W4307441593,"Birth preparedness and complication readiness (BP/CR) is an intervention designated by the World Health Organization (WHO) as an essential element of the antenatal (ANC) package with a concept of a global strategy to reduce maternal mortality. In Ethiopia, the proportion of pregnant women preparing for birth and related complications has remained low. Whereas, the need for additional study is indicated to add more evidence to the country's efforts to end preventable maternal death.A facility-based cross-sectional study was conducted from March 01 to May 01, 2021. A systematic random sampling technique was applied to recruit 422 pregnant women. Bivariable and multivariable binary logistic regression was fitted to identify factors associated with BP/CR practice. Variables with a p-value ≤ 0.25 on the bivariable analysis were included in multivariable analysis. Adjusted odds ratios (AOR) with the respective 95% confidence interval (CI) and a p-value <0.05 was used to set statistically significant variables in the multivariable analysis.A total of 414 pregnant women have participated in the study. The overall BP/CR practice level was 44.9% (95% CI: 40.1, 49.7). Preconception care utilization (PCC) (AOR = 2.31; 95% CI:1.38-3.86), urban residents (AOR = 2.00; 95% CI:1.21-3.31), knowledge of BP/CR (AOR = 2.29; 95% CI:1.27-3.47), knowledge of danger signs during pregnancy (AOR = 2.05; 95% CI:1.21-3.47), knowledge of danger signs in newborns (AOR = 2.06; 95% CI:1.21-3.47), starting ANC visits in the 1st and 2nd trimester (AOR = 2.52; 95% CI:1.40-4.52), number of ANC visit ≥ three (AOR = 1.66; 95% CI;1.01-2.74), knowing Expected Date of Delivery (EDD) (AOR = 3.71; 95% CI:2.01-6.82), and joint decision-making on obstetric services (AOR = 3.51; 95% CI;1.99-6.20) were factors significantly associated with BP/CR practice.Based on the WHO standard, this study revealed a low level of BP/CR practice among pregnant women, with only less than half of women adequately prepared for childbirth and its complications. Moreover, it has been shown that BP/CR practice is influenced by socio-economic, maternal knowledge, and health service-related factors. Therefore, improving the status of BP/CR practice by expanding awareness creation opportunities, strengthening PCC and early ANC initiation by improving pregnant women's understanding, and promoting joint decision-making on obstetric services are recommended."
https://openalex.org/W4307441665,"Existing research on the measurability of information quality (IQ) has delivered poor results and demonstrated low inter-rater agreement measured by Intra-Class Correlation (ICC) in evaluating IQ dimensions. Low ICC could result in a questionable interpretation of IQ. The purpose of this paper is to analyse whether assessors' motivation can facilitate ICC.To acquire the participants' views of IQ, we designed a survey as a gamified process. Additionally, we selected Web study to reach a broader audience. We increased the validity of the research by including a diverse set of participants (i.e. individuals with different education, demographic and social backgrounds).The study results indicate that motivation improved the ICC of IQ on average by 0.27, demonstrating an increase in measurability from poor (0.29) to moderate (0.56). The results reveal a positive correlation between motivation level and ICC, with a significant overall increase in ICC relative to previous studies. The research also identified trends in ICC for different dimensions of IQ with the best results achieved for completeness and accuracy.The work has important practical implications for future IQ research and suggests valuable guidelines. The results of this study imply that considering raters' motivation improves the measurability of IQ substantially.Previous studies addressed ICC in IQ dimension evaluation. However, assessors' motivation has been neglected. This study investigates the impact of assessors' motivation on the measurability of IQ. Compared to the results in related work, the level of agreement achieved with the most motivated group of participants was superior."
https://openalex.org/W4307441839,"Among other diseases, Covid 19 creates a critical situation around the world. Five layers have been recorded so far, resulting in the loss of millions of lives in different countries. The virus was thought to be contagious, so the government initially severely forced citizens to keep a distance from each other. Since then, several vaccines have been developed that play an important role in controlling mortality. In the case of Covid-19 mortality, the government should be forced to take significant steps in the form of lockdown, keeping you away or forcing citizens to vaccinate. In this paper, modeling of Covid-19 death rates is discussed via probability distributions. To delineate the performance of the best fitted model, the mortality rate of Pakistan and Afghanistan is considered. Numerical results conclude that the NFW model can be used to predict the mortality rate for Covid-19 patients more accurately than other probability models."
https://openalex.org/W4307441877,"The level of human exposure to arbovirus vectors, the Aedes mosquitoes, is mainly assessed by entomological methods which are labour intensive, difficult to sustain at a large scale and are affected if transmission and exposure levels are low. Alternatively, serological biomarkers which detect levels of human exposure to mosquito bites may complement the existing epidemiologic tools as they seem cost-effective, simple, rapid, and sensitive. This study explored human IgG responses to an Aedes mosquito salivary gland peptide Nterm-34kDa in Lower Moshi, a highland area with evidence of circulating arboviruses and compared the Aedes IgG responses to Anopheles mosquitoes' salivary antigen (GSG6-P1) IgG responses.Three cross-sectional surveys were conducted in 2019: during the first dry season in March, at the end of the rainy season in June and during the second dry season in September in five villages located in Lower Moshi. Blood samples were collected from enrolled participants above six months of age (age span: 7 months to 94 years) and analysed for the presence of anti-Nterm-34kDa IgG antibodies. Possible associations between Nterm-34kDa seroprevalence and participants' characteristics were determined. Levels of IgG responses and seroprevalence were correlated and compared to the already measured IgG responses and seroprevalence of Anopheles mosquitoes' salivary antigen, GSG6-P1.During the first dry season, Nterm-34kDa seroprevalence was 34.1% and significantly increased at the end of the rainy season to 45.3% (Chi square (χ2) = 6.42 p = 0.011). During the second dry season, the seroprevalence significantly declined to 26.5% (χ2 = 15.12 p<0.001). During the rainy season, seroprevalence was significantly higher among residents of Oria village (adjusted odds ratio (AOR) = 2.86; 95% CI = 1.0-7.8; p = 0.041) compared to Newland. Moreover, during the rainy season, the risk of exposure was significantly lower among individuals aged between 16 and 30 years (AOR = 0.25; 95% CI = 0.1 = 0.9; p = 0.036) compared to individuals aged between 0 and 5 years. There was weak to moderate negative correlation between N-term 34kDa IgG and gSG6-P1 antigens. N-term 34kDa seroprevalence were higher compared to gSG6-P1 seroprevalence.The findings of this study support that IgG antibody responses towards the Aedes mosquito salivary peptide Nterm-34kDa are detectable among individuals living in lower Moshi and vary with season and geographical area. More individuals are exposed to Aedes mosquito bites than Anopheles mosquito and those exposed to Aedes bites are not necessarily exposed to Anopheles mosquitoes."
https://openalex.org/W4307441900,"Only two previous studies in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients have identified that the blood concentrations of uromodulin are lower in nephritis. However, none of them had evaluated whether a low serum uromodulin adjusted by the glomerular filtration rate (sUromod/eGFR index) contributed to identify patients in risk of lupus nephritis (LN) using multivariable models.Therefore, this study aimed two objectives to evaluate the association between low serum uromodulin levels and low sUromod adjusted by eGFR with renal flares in SLE excluding effects of potential confounders in multivariable analyses; and to identify the value of low sUmod and low sUmod/eGFR index as a potential diagnostic marker of LN.Design: Cross-sectional study. SLE patients (n = 114) were investigated for lupus flare with renal SLEDAI. Two groups: a) SLE with renal flare (renal-SLEDAI≥4, n = 41) and b) SLE non-renal flare (renal SLEDAI<4, n = 73). SLE patients were evaluated by other indices including a global disease activity index (SLEDAI) and SLICC renal disease activity score. Serum uromodulin levels (ng/mL) were quantified by ELISA. Serum uromodulin was adjusted by eGFR (sUromod/eGFR index). Cutt-offs of low sUromodulin and low sUromod/eGFR index were computed, ROC curves were performed and values of diagnostic tests were obtained. Multivariable logistic regression models were performed to identify if low sUromod/eGFR index is associated to renal flares.Low serum uromodulin and low sUromod/eGFR index correlated to high scores of renal-SLEDAI, SLICC-renal and proteinuria. SLE patients with a renal flare had lower uromodulin levels compared to SLE patients without renal flare (p = 0.004). After adjusting by potential confounders, the low sUromod/eGFR index (<0.80 ng/mL) increased the risk of a renal flare (OR, 2.91; 95%CI, 1.21 to 6.98; p = 0.02).We propose the low sUromod/eGFR index as a potential new marker of renal disease activity in SLE."
