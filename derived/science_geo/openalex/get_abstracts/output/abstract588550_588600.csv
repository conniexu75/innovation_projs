https://openalex.org/W2606397457,"Since the celebrated discovery of graphene, the family of two-dimensional (2D) materials has grown to encompass a broad range of electronic properties. Recent additions include spin-valley coupled semiconductors, Ising superconductors that can be tuned into a quantum metal, possible Mott insulators with tunable charge-density waves, and topological semi-metals with edge transport. Despite this progress, there is still no 2D crystal with intrinsic magnetism, which would be useful for many technologies such as sensing, information, and data storage. Theoretically, magnetic order is prohibited in the 2D isotropic Heisenberg model at finite temperatures by the Mermin-Wagner theorem. However, magnetic anisotropy removes this restriction and enables, for instance, the occurrence of 2D Ising ferromagnetism. Here, we use magneto-optical Kerr effect (MOKE) microscopy to demonstrate that monolayer chromium triiodide (CrI3) is an Ising ferromagnet with out-of-plane spin orientation. Its Curie temperature of 45 K is only slightly lower than the 61 K of the bulk crystal, consistent with a weak interlayer coupling. Moreover, our studies suggest a layer-dependent magnetic phase transition, showcasing the hallmark thickness-dependent physical properties typical of van der Waals crystals. Remarkably, bilayer CrI3 displays suppressed magnetization with a metamagnetic effect, while in trilayer the interlayer ferromagnetism observed in the bulk crystal is restored. Our work creates opportunities for studying magnetism by harnessing the unique features of atomically-thin materials, such as electrical control for realizing magnetoelectronics, and van der Waals engineering for novel interface phenomena."
https://openalex.org/W2528996360,"Frequency combs produced by solitons in silicon-based optical microresonators are used to transmit data streams of more than 50 terabits per second in telecommunication wavelength bands. Frequency combs—light sources that emit a wide spectrum of sharp lines with equally spaced frequencies—have recently become of interest for use in high-capacity optical data transmission. The possibility of producing frequency combs using compact, chip-integrated microresonators promises scalability and practical applicability. Christian Koos et al. make use of a recently developed technique whereby frequency combs are produced by continuously circulating optical solitons—waveforms that preserve their shape during propagation—in silicon-based microresonators. They use two interleaved, chip-based frequency combs to demonstrate transmission of a data stream of more than 50 terabits per second on 179 individual optical carriers in telecommunication wavelength bands. The technology could be used to develop efficient, highly scalable communication systems that could help to address the challenge of a continually growing demand for data capacity. Solitons are waveforms that preserve their shape while propagating, as a result of a balance of dispersion and nonlinearity1,2. Soliton-based data transmission schemes were investigated in the 1980s and showed promise as a way of overcoming the limitations imposed by dispersion of optical fibres. However, these approaches were later abandoned in favour of wavelength-division multiplexing schemes, which are easier to implement and offer improved scalability to higher data rates. Here we show that solitons could make a comeback in optical communications, not as a competitor but as a key element of massively parallel wavelength-division multiplexing. Instead of encoding data on the soliton pulse train itself, we use continuous-wave tones of the associated frequency comb as carriers for communication. Dissipative Kerr solitons (DKSs)3,4 (solitons that rely on a double balance of parametric gain and cavity loss, as well as dispersion and nonlinearity) are generated as continuously circulating pulses in an integrated silicon nitride microresonator5 via four-photon interactions mediated by the Kerr nonlinearity, leading to low-noise, spectrally smooth, broadband optical frequency combs6. We use two interleaved DKS frequency combs to transmit a data stream of more than 50 terabits per second on 179 individual optical carriers that span the entire telecommunication C and L bands (centred around infrared telecommunication wavelengths of 1.55 micrometres). We also demonstrate coherent detection of a wavelength-division multiplexing data stream by using a pair of DKS frequency combs—one as a multi-wavelength light source at the transmitter and the other as the corresponding local oscillator at the receiver. This approach exploits the scalability of microresonator-based DKS frequency comb sources for massively parallel optical communications at both the transmitter and the receiver. Our results demonstrate the potential of these sources to replace the arrays of continuous-wave lasers that are currently used in high-speed communications. In combination with advanced spatial multiplexing schemes7,8 and highly integrated silicon photonic circuits9, DKS frequency combs could bring chip-scale petabit-per-second transceivers into reach."
https://openalex.org/W2623319323,"Fossil evidence points to an African origin of Homo sapiens from a group called either H. heidelbergensis or H. rhodesiensis. However, the exact place and time of emergence of H. sapiens remain obscure because the fossil record is scarce and the chronological age of many key specimens remains uncertain. In particular, it is unclear whether the present day 'modern' morphology rapidly emerged approximately 200 thousand years ago (ka) among earlier representatives of H. sapiens or evolved gradually over the last 400 thousand years. Here we report newly discovered human fossils from Jebel Irhoud, Morocco, and interpret the affinities of the hominins from this site with other archaic and recent human groups. We identified a mosaic of features including facial, mandibular and dental morphology that aligns the Jebel Irhoud material with early or recent anatomically modern humans and more primitive neurocranial and endocranial morphology. In combination with an age of 315 ± 34 thousand years (as determined by thermoluminescence dating), this evidence makes Jebel Irhoud the oldest and richest African Middle Stone Age hominin site that documents early stages of the H. sapiens clade in which key features of modern morphology were established. Furthermore, it shows that the evolutionary processes behind the emergence of H. sapiens involved the whole African continent."
https://openalex.org/W2391304757,"The estimation of the correct number of dimensions is a long-standing problem in psychometrics. Several methods have been proposed, such as parallel analysis (PA), Kaiser-Guttman’s eigenvalue-greater-than-one rule, multiple average partial procedure (MAP), the maximum-likelihood approaches that use fit indexes as BIC and EBIC and the less used and studied approach called very simple structure (VSS). In the present paper a new approach to estimate the number of dimensions will be introduced and compared via simulation to the traditional techniques pointed above. The approach proposed in the current paper is called exploratory graph analysis (EGA), since it is based on the graphical lasso with the regularization parameter specified using EBIC. The number of dimensions is verified using the walktrap, a random walk algorithm used to identify communities in networks. In total, 32,000 data sets were simulated to fit known factor structures, with the data sets varying across different criteria: number of factors (2 and 4), number of items (5 and 10), sample size (100, 500, 1000 and 5000) and correlation between factors (orthogonal, .20, .50 and .70), resulting in 64 different conditions. For each condition, 500 data sets were simulated using lavaan. The result shows that the EGA performs comparable to parallel analysis, EBIC, eBIC and to Kaiser-Guttman rule in a number of situations, especially when the number of factors was two. However, EGA was the only technique able to correctly estimate the number of dimensions in the four-factor structure when the correlation between factors were .7, showing an accuracy of 100% for a sample size of 5,000 observations. Finally, the EGA was used to estimate the number of factors in a real dataset, in order to compare its performance with the other six techniques tested in the simulation study."
https://openalex.org/W2623923045,"Artificial sweeteners have been widely used in the modern diet, and their observed effects on human health have been inconsistent, with both beneficial and adverse outcomes reported. Obesity and type 2 diabetes have dramatically increased in the U.S. and other countries over the last two decades. Numerous studies have indicated an important role of the gut microbiome in body weight control and glucose metabolism and regulation. Interestingly, the artificial sweetener saccharin could alter gut microbiota and induce glucose intolerance, raising questions about the contribution of artificial sweeteners to the global epidemic of obesity and diabetes. Acesulfame-potassium (Ace-K), a FDA-approved artificial sweetener, is commonly used, but its toxicity data reported to date are considered inadequate. In particular, the functional impact of Ace-K on the gut microbiome is largely unknown. In this study, we explored the effects of Ace-K on the gut microbiome and the changes in fecal metabolic profiles using 16S rRNA sequencing and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) metabolomics. We found that Ace-K consumption perturbed the gut microbiome of CD-1 mice after a 4-week treatment. The observed body weight gain, shifts in the gut bacterial community composition, enrichment of functional bacterial genes related to energy metabolism, and fecal metabolomic changes were highly gender-specific, with differential effects observed for males and females. In particular, ace-K increased body weight gain of male but not female mice. Collectively, our results may provide a novel understanding of the interaction between artificial sweeteners and the gut microbiome, as well as the potential role of this interaction in the development of obesity and the associated chronic inflammation."
https://openalex.org/W2622932773,"A novel stress-inducible protein, Sestrin2 (Sesn2), declines in the heart with aging. AMPK has emerged as a pertinent stress-activated kinase that has been shown to have cardioprotective capabilities against myocardial ischemic injury. We identified the interaction between Sesn2 and AMPK in the ischemic heart. To determine whether ischemic AMPK activation—modulated by the Sesn2-AMPK complex in the heart—is impaired in aging that sensitizes the heart to ischemic insults, young C57BL/6 mice (age 3–4 mo), middle-aged mice (age 10–12 mo), and aged mice (age 24–26 mo) were subjected to left anterior descending coronary artery occlusion for in vivo regional ischemia. The ex vivo working heart system was used for measuring substrate metabolism. The protein level of Sesn2 in hearts was gradually decreased with aging. Of interest, ischemic AMPK activation was blunted in aged hearts compared with young hearts (P < 0.05); the AMPK downstream glucose uptake and the rate of glucose oxidation were significantly impaired in aged hearts during ischemia and reperfusion (P < 0.05 vs. young hearts). Myocardial infarction size was larger in aged hearts (P < 0.05 vs. young hearts). Immunoprecipitation with Sesn2 Ab revealed that cardiac Sesn2 forms a complex with AMPK and upstream liver kinase B1 (LKB1) during ischemia. Of interest, the binding affinity between Sesn2 and AMPK upstream LKB1 is impaired in aged hearts during ischemia (P < 0.05 vs. young hearts). Furthermore, Sesn2-knockout hearts demonstrate a cardiac phenotype and response to ischemic stress that is similar to wild-type aged hearts (i.e., impaired ischemic AMPK activation and higher sensitivity to ischemia- and reperfusion- induced injury). Adeno-associated virus–Sesn2 was delivered to aged hearts via a coronary delivery approach and significantly rescued the protein level of Sesn2 and the ischemic tolerance of aged hearts; therefore, Sesn2 is a scaffold protein that mediates AMPK activation in the ischemic myocardium via an interaction with AMPK upstream LKB1. Decreased Sesn2 levels in aging lead to a blunted ischemic AMPK activation, alterations in substrate metabolism, and an increased sensitivity to ischemic insults—Quan, N., Sun, W., Wang, L., Chen, X., Bogan, J.

https://openalex.org/W2622222516,"Background Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune inflammatory disorder. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) and pro-inflammatory cytokines have been believed to be involved in the etiopathogenesis of the disease. The aim of the study was to determine the correlation of inflammatory cytokines with 25-hydroxy vitamin D and ROS. Methods 100 RA patients and 50 healthy age and sex matched individuals were included in the study. Patients were further divided on the basis of presence or absence of rheumatoid factor and disease severity. Serum 25-hydroxy vitamin D levels were monitored by chemiluminescent immunoassay. 10% hematocrit was used to detect the level of ROS by spectro fluorometer. The levels of inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-10 and IL-17) were determined in plasma by ELISA. Results The level of 25-hydroxy vitamin D was found to be decreased in RA patients in comparison to the control group. However the level of ROS and inflammatory cytokines were found to be elevated in RA patients in comparison with the healthy controls, with the increase being more pronounced in seropositive and RA patients having high disease severity. Inflammatory cytokines showed negative correlation with 25-hydroxy vitamin D and positive correlation with ROS. Conclusion This study for the first time shows the association of inflammatory cytokines with 25-hydroxy vitamin D and ROS in RA patients. The results suggest that 25-hydroxy vitamin D being an immune modulator is decreased in the serum of RA patients. Further ROS and cytokines play an important role in the pathogenesis of RA and are responsible for increasing the severity of disease."
https://openalex.org/W2622819944,"Background/Objective Inadvertent intraoperative hypothermia (core temperature <36°C) is a frequently preventable complication with several adverse consequences. Our study aimed to determine the overall incidence of inadvertent intraoperative hypothermia and its risk factors associated with clinical outcomes in this national survey in China. Methods We conducted a national cross-sectional study with 30 days postoperative follow-up from November 2014 through August 2015. A total of 3132 eligible patients underwent general anesthesia were randomly selected from 28 hospitals in the nationwide of China. Results The overall incidence of intraoperative hypothermia was as high as 44.3%, in which cumulative incidence rates of hypothermia being 17.8%, 36.2%, 42.5% and 44.1% within 1 h, 2 h, 3 h and 4 h respectively following induction of anesthesia. All patients were warmed passively by covering of surgical draping, sheets or cotton blankets, whereas only 14.2% of patients received active warming with space heaters or electric heater or electronic blankets. Compared to normothermic patients, patients with hypothermia is associated with more postoperative ICU admit, longer PACU and more postoperative hospital days, but no difference in surgical site infection (SSI) rates or 30-day mortality. Several factors were shown to be associated with decreased risk of hypothermia. They are active warming (OR = 0.46, 95% CI 0.26–0.81), BMI ≥ 25 (OR = 0.54, 95% CI 0.45–0.65), higher baseline core temperature (OR = 0.04, 95% CI 0.03–0.06), and higher ambient temperature (OR = 0.83, 95% CI 0.78–0.88). Risk factors associated with an increased risk of hypothermia included major-plus surgery (OR = 1.49, 95% CI 1.23–1.79), and long anesthesia (>2 h) (OR = 2.60, 95% CI 2.09–3.24). Conclusions The incidence of intraoperative hypothermia in China is high, and the rate of active warming of patients during operation is low. Hypothermia is associated with more postoperative shivering, increased ICU admissions, and longer postoperative hospital days."
https://openalex.org/W2622136408,"IL-6 is a pleiotropic cytokine with complex roles in inflammation and metabolic disease. The role of IL-6 as a pro- or anti-inflammatory cytokine is still unclear. Within the pancreatic islet, IL-6 stimulates secretion of the prosurvival incretin hormone glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) by α cells and acts directly on β cells to stimulate insulin secretion in vitro Uncovering physiologic mechanisms promoting β-cell survival under conditions of inflammation and stress can identify important pathways for diabetes prevention and treatment. Given the established role of GLP-1 in promoting β-cell survival, we hypothesized that IL-6 may also directly protect β cells from apoptosis. Herein, we show that IL-6 robustly activates signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), a transcription factor that is involved in autophagy. IL-6 stimulates LC3 conversion and autophagosome formation in cultured β cells. In vivo IL-6 infusion stimulates a robust increase in lysosomes in the pancreas that is restricted to the islet. Autophagy is critical for β-cell homeostasis, particularly under conditions of stress and increased insulin demand. The stimulation of autophagy by IL-6 is regulated via multiple complementary mechanisms including inhibition of mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) and activation of Akt, ultimately leading to increases in autophagy enzyme production. Pretreatment with IL-6 renders β cells resistant to apoptosis induced by proinflammatory cytokines, and inhibition of autophagy with chloroquine prevents the ability of IL-6 to protect from apoptosis. Importantly, we find that IL-6 can activate STAT3 and the autophagy enzyme GABARAPL1 in human islets. We also see evidence of decreased IL-6 pathway signaling in islets from donors with type 2 diabetes. On the basis of our results, we propose direct stimulation of autophagy as a novel mechanism for IL-6-mediated protection of β cells from stress-induced apoptosis.-Linnemann, A.

https://openalex.org/W2592770160,"One of the key assumptions of the standard model of particle physics is that the interactions of the charged leptons, namely electrons, muons and taus, differ only because of their different masses. Whereas precision tests comparing processes involving electrons and muons have not revealed any definite violation of this assumption, recent studies of B-meson decays involving the higher-mass tau lepton have resulted in observations that challenge lepton universality at the level of four standard deviations. A confirmation of these results would point to new particles or interactions, and could have profound implications for our understanding of particle physics. Recent measurements of B-meson decays in which tau leptons are produced might challenge the standard model assumption that interactions of leptons differ only because of their different masses. The standard model of particle physics is incomplete because it cannot explain phenomena such as dark matter. At particle colliders like the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN, physicists are looking for clues to how the standard model could be amended. But so far the LHC has produced only a few results that represent good leads. One type of experiment that has revealed cracks in the standard model involves high-precision measurements of flavor-changing neutral currents involving beauty quarks. Focusing on the on-going efforts at the LHC, the authors review recent such measurements and discuss whether the discrepancies found hint at new particles that have yet to be discovered."

https://openalex.org/W2623780965,"Knowledge of the diet and trophic ecology of apex predators is key for the implementation of effective ecosystem as well as species-based management initiatives. Using a combination of stomach content data and stable isotope analysis (δ15N and δ13C) the current study provides information on size-based and sex-specific variations in diet, trophic position (TP) and foraging habitat of tiger sharks (Galeocerdo cuvier) caught in the KwaZulu-Natal Sharks Board bather protection program. This study presents the longest time-series and most detailed analysis of stomach content data for G. cuvier worldwide. Prey identified from 628 non-empty stomachs revealed a size-based shift in diet. Reptiles, birds, mysticetes, and large shark species increased in dietary importance with G. cuvier size, concomitant with a decrease in smaller prey such as batoids and teleosts. Seasonal and decadal shifts in diet driven primarily by changes in the importance of elasmobranchs and mammal (cetacean) prey were recorded for medium sized (150-220 cm) G. cuvier. Both stomach content and stable isotope analysis indicated that G. cuvier is a generalist feeder at the population level. Size-based δ13C profiles indicated a movement to offshore foraging habitats by larger G. cuvier. Calculated TP varied by method ranging from 4.0 to 5.0 (TPSCA for stomach contents) and from 3.6 to 4.5 (TPscaled and TPadditive for δ15N). Large (> 220 cm) G. cuvier did not feed at discrete trophic levels, but rather throughout the food web. These data provide key information on the ecological role of G. cuvier to improve the accuracy of regional food web modelling. This will enable a better understanding of the ecological impacts related to changes in the abundance of this predator."
https://openalex.org/W2624648395,"Distinguishing between the bones of sheep and goat is a notorious challenge in zooarchaeology. Several methodological contributions have been published at different times and by various people to facilitate this task, largely relying on a macro-morphological approach. This is now routinely adopted by zooarchaeologists but, although it certainly has its value, has also been shown to have limitations. Morphological discriminant criteria can vary in different populations and correct identification is highly dependent upon a researcher’s experience, availability of appropriate reference collections, and many other factors that are difficult to quantify. There is therefore a need to establish a more objective system, susceptible to scrutiny. In order to fulfil such a requirement, this paper offers a comprehensive morphometric method for the identification of sheep and goat postcranial bones, using a sample of more than 150 modern skeletons as a basis, and building on previous pioneering work. The proposed method is based on measurements—some newly created, others previously published–and its use is recommended in combination with the more traditional morphological approach. Measurement ratios, used to translate morphological traits into biometrical attributes, are demonstrated to have substantial diagnostic potential, with the vast majority of specimens correctly assigned to species. The efficacy of the new method is also tested with Discriminant Analysis, which provides a successful verification of the biometrical indices, a statistical means to select the most promising measurements, and an additional line of analysis to be used in conjunction with the others."
https://openalex.org/W2624439128,"Water management and nitrogen application are critical factors in wheat grain yield and protein quality. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of irrigation and nitrogen application on the grain yield, protein content and amino acid composition of winter wheat. Field experiments were conducted in a split-plot design with three replications in high-yielding land on the North China Plain in 2012/2013, 2013/2014 and 2014/2015. Three irrigation treatments were examined in main plots: no irrigation, irrigation at jointing, and irrigation at jointing plus anthesis, while subplots were assigned to nitrogen treatment at four different rates: 0, 180, 240, 300 kg N ha-1, respectively. The results indicated that irrigation at jointing and at jointing plus anthesis improved grain yield by an average of 12.79 and 18.65% across three cropping seasons, respectively, compared with no irrigation. However, different irrigation treatments had no significant effect on grain protein content in any cropping season. Compared with no N treatment, 180, 240, and 300 kg N ha-1 N application significantly increased grain yield, by 58.66, 61.26 and 63.42% respectively, averaged over three cropping seasons. Grain protein and the total, essential and non-essential amino acid content significantly increased with increasing nitrogen application. Irrigation significantly improved the essential amino acid index (EAAI) and protein-digestibility-corrected amino acid score (PDCAAS) compared with no irrigation; however, N application decreased them by an average of 7.68 and 11.18% across three cropping seasons, respectively. EAAI and PDCAAS were positively correlated, however, they were highly negatively correlated with yield and grain protein content."
https://openalex.org/W2624003845,"Lignin in plant biomass represents a target for engineering strategies towards the development of a sustainable bioeconomy. In addition to the conventional lignin monomers, namely p-coumaryl, coniferyl and sinapyl alcohols, tricin has been shown to be part of the native lignin polymer in certain monocot species. Because tricin is considered to initiate the polymerization of lignin chains, elucidating its biosynthesis and mechanism of export to the cell wall constitute novel challenges for the engineering of bioenergy crops. Late steps of tricin biosynthesis require two methylation reactions involving the pathway intermediate selgin. It has recently been demonstrated in rice and maize that caffeate O-methyltransferase (COMT) involved in the synthesis syringyl (S) lignin units derived from sinapyl alcohol also participates in the synthesis of tricin in planta. In this work, we validate in sorghum (Sorghum bicolor L.) that the O-methyltransferase responsible for the production of S lignin units (SbCOMT / Bmr12) is also involved in the synthesis of lignin-linked tricin. In particular, we show that biomass from the sorghum bmr12 mutant contains lower level of tricin incorporated into lignin, and that SbCOMT can methylate the tricin precursors luteolin and selgin. Our genetic and biochemical data point toward a general mechanism whereby COMT is involved in the synthesis of both tricin and S lignin units."

https://openalex.org/W2622650444,"Preeclampsia is a leading cause of perinatal maternal–foetal mortality and morbidity. The aim of this study is to identify the key microRNAs and genes in preeclampsia and uncover their potential functions. We downloaded the miRNA expression profile of GSE84260 and the gene expression profile of GSE73374 from the Gene Expression Omnibus database. Differentially expressed miRNAs and genes were identified and compared to miRNA-target information from MiRWalk 2.0, and a total of 65 differentially expressed miRNAs (DEMIs), including 32 up-regulated miRNAs and 33 down-regulated miRNAs, and 91 differentially expressed genes (DEGs), including 83 up-regulated genes and 8 down-regulated genes, were identified. The pathway enrichment analyses of the DEMIs showed that the up-regulated DEMIs were enriched in the Hippo signalling pathway and MAPK signalling pathway, and the down-regulated DEMIs were enriched in HTLV-I infection and miRNAs in cancers. The gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway (KEGG) enrichment analyses of the DEGs were performed using Multifaceted Analysis Tool for Human Transcriptome. The up-regulated DEGs were enriched in biological processes (BPs), including the response to cAMP, response to hydrogen peroxide and cell-cell adhesion mediated by integrin; no enrichment of down-regulated DEGs was identified. KEGG analysis showed that the up-regulated DEGs were enriched in the Hippo signalling pathway and pathways in cancer. A PPI network of the DEGs was constructed by using Cytoscape software, and FOS, STAT1, MMP14, ITGB1, VCAN, DUSP1, LDHA, MCL1, MET, and ZFP36 were identified as the hub genes. The current study illustrates a characteristic microRNA profile and gene profile in preeclampsia, which may contribute to the interpretation of the progression of preeclampsia and provide novel biomarkers and therapeutic targets for preeclampsia."
https://openalex.org/W2622704645,"Women’s preferences for men’s androgen dependent secondary sexual traits are proposed to be phenotypically plastic in response to exposure to pathogens and pathogen disgust. While previous studies report that masculinity in facial shape is more attractive to women who have recently been exposed to pathogenic cues and who are high in self-reported pathogen disgust, facial hair may reduce male attractiveness under conditions of high pathogens as beards are a possible breeding ground for disease carrying ectoparasites. In the present study, we test whether women’s preferences for beardedness and facial masculinity vary due to exposure to different pathogenic cues. Participants (N = 688, mean age + 1SD = 31.94 years, SD = 6.69, range = 18–67) rated the attractiveness of facial composite stimuli of men when they were clean-shaven or fully bearded. These stimuli were also manipulated in order to vary sexual dimorphism by ±50%. Ratings were conducted before and after exposure to one of four experimental treatments in which participants were primed to either high pathogens (e.g. infected cuts), ectoparasites (e.g. body lice), a mixture of pathogens and ectoparasites, or a control condition (e.g. innocuous liquids). Participants then completed the three-domain disgust scale measuring attitudes to moral, sexual and pathogen disgust. We predicted that women would prefer facial masculinity following exposure to pathogenic cues, but would show reduced preferences for facial hair following exposure to ectoparasites. Women preferred full beards over clean-shaven faces and masculinised over feminised faces. However, none of the experimental treatments influenced the direction of preferences for facial masculinity or beardedness. We also found no association between women’s self-reported pathogen disgust and their preferences for facial masculinity. However, there was a weak positive association between moral disgust scores and preferences for facial masculinity, which might reflect conservatism and preferences for gender typicality in faces. Women’s preferences for beards were positively associated with their pathogen disgust, which runs contrary to our predictions and may reflect preferences for high quality individuals who can withstand any costs of beardedness, although further replications are necessary before firm conclusions can be made. We conclude that there is little support for pathogenic exposure being a mechanism that underpins women’s directional preferences for masculine traits."
https://openalex.org/W2623542114,"The role of gender in prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) participation under Option B+ has not been adequately studied, but it is critical for reducing losses to follow-up. This study used qualitative methods to examine the interplay of gender and individual, interpersonal, health system, and community factors that contribute to PMTCT participation in Malawi and Uganda. We conducted in-depth interviews with women in PMTCT, women lost to follow-up, government health workers, and stakeholders at organizations supporting PMTCT as well as focus group discussions with men. We analyzed the data using thematic content analysis. We found many similarities in key themes across respondent groups and between the two countries. The main facilitators of PMTCT participation were knowledge of the health benefits of ART, social support, and self-efficacy. The main barriers were fear of HIV disclosure and stigma and lack of social support, male involvement, self-efficacy, and agency. Under Option B+, women learn about their HIV status and start lifelong ART on the same day, before they have a chance to talk to their husbands or families. Respondents explained that very few husbands accompanied their wives to the clinic, because they felt it was a female space and were worried that others would think their wives were controlling them. Many respondents said women fear disclosing, because they fear HIV stigma as well as the risk of divorce and loss of economic support. If women do not disclose, it is difficult for them to participate in PMTCT in secret. If they do disclose, they must abide by their husbands' decisions about their PMTCT participation, and some husbands are unsupportive or actively discouraging. To improve PMTCT participation, Ministries of Health should use evidence-based strategies to address HIV stigma, challenges related to disclosure, insufficient social support and male involvement, and underlying gender inequality."
https://openalex.org/W2624029039,"Hippocampus oxidative stress is considered pathogenic in neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer disease (AD), and in neurodevelopmental disorders, such as Angelman syndrome (AS). Yet clinical benefits of antioxidant treatment for these diseases remain unclear because conventional imaging methods are unable to guide management of therapies in specific hippocampus subfields in vivo that underlie abnormal behavior. Excessive production of paramagnetic free radicals in nonhippocampus brain tissue can be measured in vivo as a greater-than-normal 1/T1 that is quenchable with antioxidant as measured by quench-assisted (Quest) MRI. Here, we further test this approach in phantoms, and we present proof-of-concept data in models of AD-like and AS hippocampus oxidative stress that also exhibit impaired spatial learning and memory. AD-like models showed an abnormal gradient along the CA1 dorsal–ventral axis of excessive free radical production as measured by Quest MRI, and redox-sensitive calcium dysregulation as measured by manganese-enhanced MRI and electrophysiology. In the AS model, abnormally high free radical levels were observed in dorsal and ventral CA1.

These proteins are potential ingredients in functional foods used for the management of a range of immune related problems, both in infants and adults. However, the mechanism behind these effects is unknown. We hypothesize that the interaction of peptides with Toll-like receptors (TLRs) can induce immune effects, since these receptors are known to sample many dietary molecules in the intestine in order to regulate immune effects. To investigate this, we compared the immune effects and TLR activation and inhibition by whey and casein hydrolysates with different hydrolysis levels. We first measured cytokine production in primary peripheral blood mononuclear cells stimulated with either whey, casein, or their hydrolysates. IL-10 and TNFα were induced by whey hydrolysates (decreasing with increasing hydrolysis level), but not by casein hydrolysates. Next, the activation of TLR 2, 3, 5 and 9 receptors were observed by intact and mildly hydrolysed whey proteins only and not by casein hydrolysates in TLR reporter cell lines. Many casein hydrolysates inhibited TLR signaling (mainly TLR 5 and 9). These results demonstrate that the effects of cow’s milk proteins on the immune system are protein type and hydrolysis dependent. TLR signaling is suggested as a possible mechanism for differences in effect. This knowledge contributes to a better understanding of the immune effects of hydrolysates and the design of infant formula, and nutrition in general, with specific immunoregulatory effects."
https://openalex.org/W2622814522,"Monitoring fish assemblages is needed to assess whether Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) are meeting their conservation and fisheries management goals, as it allows one to track the progress of recovery of exploited species and associated communities. Underwater Visual Census techniques (UVC) are used to monitor fish assemblages in MPAs. UVCs should be adapted to fish abundance, body-size and behaviour, which can strongly affect fish detectability. In Mediterranean subtidal habitats, however, UVC strip transects of one surface area (25x5 m2) are commonly used to survey the whole fish assemblage, from large shy fish to small crypto-benthic fish. Most high trophic level predators (HTLPs) are large shy fish which rarely swim close to divers and, consequently, their abundance may be under-estimated with commonly used transects. Here, we propose an improvement to traditional transect surveys to better account for differences in behaviour among and within species. First, we compared the effectiveness of combining two transect surface areas (large: 35x20 m2; medium: 25x5 m2) in quantifying large, shy fish within and outside Mediterranean MPAs. We identified species-specific body-size thresholds defining a smaller and a larger size class better sampled by medium and large transects respectively. Combining large and medium transects provided more accurate biomass and species richness estimates for large, shy species than using medium transects alone. We thus combined the new approach with two other transect surface areas commonly used to survey crypto-benthic (10x1 m2) and necto-benthic (25x5 m2) species in order to assess how effectively MPAs protection the whole fish assemblage. We verified that MPAs offer significant protection for HTLPs, their response in terms of biomass and density increase in MPAs was always higher in magnitude than other functional groups. Inside MPAs, the contribution of HTLP reached >25% of total fish biomass, against < 2% outside MPAs. Surveys with multiple transect surface areas allow for a more realistic assessment of the structure of the whole fish assemblage and better assessment of potential recovery of HTLPs within reserves of HTLP."
https://openalex.org/W2623160098,"The recent episodes of haze in Southeast Asia have caused some of the worst regional atmospheric pollution ever recorded in history. In order to control the levels of airborne fine particulate matters (PM) indoors, filtration systems providing high PM capturing efficiency are often sought, which inadvertently also results in high airflow resistance (or pressure drop) that increases the energy consumption for air distribution. A pre-conditioning mechanism promoting the formation of particle clusters to enhance PM capturing efficiency without adding flow resistance in the air distribution ductwork could provide an energy-efficient solution. This pre-conditioning mechanism can be fulfilled by acoustic agglomeration, which is a phenomenon that promotes the coagulation of suspended particles by acoustic waves propagating in the fluid medium. This paper discusses the basic mechanisms of acoustic agglomeration along with influencing factors that could affect the agglomeration efficiency. The feasibility to apply acoustic agglomeration to improve filtration in air-conditioning and mechanical ventilation (ACMV) systems is investigated experimentally in a small-scale wind tunnel. Experimental results indicate that this novel application of acoustic pre-conditioning improves the PM2.5 filtration efficiency of the test filters by up to 10% without introducing additional pressure drop. The fan energy savings from not having to switch to a high capturing efficiency filter largely outstrip the additional energy consumed by the acoustics system. This, as a whole, demonstrates potential energy savings from the combined acoustic-enhanced filtration system without compromising on PM capturing efficiency."
https://openalex.org/W2622524621,"Background High dietary sodium aggravates renal disease by affecting blood pressure and by its recently shown pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic effects. Moreover, pro-inflammatory modification of renal heparan sulfate (HS) can induce tissue remodeling. We aim to investigate if high sodium intake in normotensive rats converts renal HS into a pro-inflammatory phenotype, able to bind more sodium and orchestrate inflammation, fibrosis and lymphangiogenesis. Methods Wistar rats received a normal diet for 4 weeks, or 8% NaCl diet for 2 or 4 weeks. Blood pressure was monitored, and plasma, urine and tissue collected. Tissue sodium was measured by flame spectroscopy. Renal HS and tubulo-interstitial remodeling were studied by biochemical, immunohistochemical and qRT-PCR approaches. Results High sodium rats showed a transient increase in blood pressure (week 1; p<0.01) and increased sodium excretion (p<0.05) at 2 and 4 weeks compared to controls. Tubulo-interstitial T-cells, myofibroblasts and mRNA levels of VCAM1, TGF-β1 and collagen type III significantly increased after 4 weeks (all p<0.05). There was a trend for increased macrophage infiltration and lymphangiogenesis (both p = 0.07). Despite increased dermal sodium over time (p<0.05), renal concentrations remained stable. Renal HS of high sodium rats showed increased sulfation (p = 0.05), increased L-selectin binding to HS (p<0,05), and a reduction of sulfation-sensitive anti-HS mAbs JM403 (p<0.001) and 10E4 (p<0.01). Hyaluronan expression increased under high salt conditions (p<0.01) without significant changes in the chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan versican. Statistical analyses showed that sodium-induced tissue remodeling responses partly correlated with observed HS changes. Conclusion We show that high salt intake by healthy normotensive rats convert renal HS into high sulfated pro-inflammatory glycans involved in tissue remodeling events, but not in increased sodium storage."
https://openalex.org/W2622260176,"Background Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) accounts for 15–20% of all breast cancers and usually requires the administration of adjuvant chemotherapy after surgery but even with this treatment many patients still suffer from a relapse. The main objective of this study was to identify proteomics-based biomarkers that predict the response to standard adjuvant chemotherapy, so that patients at are not going to benefit from it can be offered therapeutic alternatives. Methods We analyzed the proteome of a retrospective series of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded TNBC tissue applying high-throughput label-free quantitative proteomics. We identified several protein signatures with predictive value, which were validated with quantitative targeted proteomics in an independent cohort of patients and further evaluated in publicly available transcriptomics data. Results Using univariate Cox analysis, a panel of 18 proteins was significantly associated with distant metastasis-free survival of patients (p<0.01). A reduced 5-protein profile with prognostic value was identified and its prediction performance was assessed in an independent targeted proteomics experiment and a publicly available transcriptomics dataset. Predictor P5 including peptides from proteins RAC2, RAB6A, BIEA and IPYR was the best performance protein combination in predicting relapse after adjuvant chemotherapy in TNBC patients. Conclusions This study identified a protein combination signature that complements histopathological prognostic factors in TNBC treated with adjuvant chemotherapy. The protein signature can be used in paraffin-embedded samples, and after a prospective validation in independent series, it could be used as predictive clinical test in order to recommend participation in clinical trials or a more exhaustive follow-up."
https://openalex.org/W2623354142,"More than 90% of head and neck infections are caused by pathological changes originating in the teeth. When odontogenic infections are not properly treated, infections may spread to distant spaces and cause more serious infections in fascial spaces, ultimately leading to deep neck infections. Clinical experience has indicated that patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) may be more susceptible to facial cellulitis and deep neck infections caused by odontogenic infections. This study used the Taiwan National Health Insurance Database (NHIRD) to analyze and examine the correlation between DM and odontogenic infections in patients. To this end, this study analyzed 1 million NHIRD individual datasets from 2005, of which 964,182 individuals had medical treatment records. The insurance database also recorded related factors such as age, sex, duration of hospital stays, season, and whether patients were low income. We also analyzed the correlation between urbanization and the studied diseases. The results indicated that the correlation between facial cellulitis and DM patients was confirmed; facial cellulitis was most likely to occur 2 years after the initial DM diagnosis, with a risk occurrence 1.409 times greater than that of the control group. Facial cellulitis is more likely to occur in patients originating from poorer socioeconomic backgrounds, and female DM patients are more likely to experience this condition. These conclusions may facilitate the establishment of clinical guidelines for preventative education and treatment. Oral prevention and health education for high-risk patients, as well as early-stage surgical intervention and antibiotic usage in early-stage odontogenic infections, can prevent disease progression, improve patient recovery rates, and reduce the use and waste of medical resources."

Alteration of protein glycosylation is a common phenomenon during tumor progression, migration, invasion, angiogenesis, as well as metastasis. Hence, aberrant glycan structures and the induced corresponding anti-carbohydrate antibodies are potential biomarkers for cancer diagnosis. In this study, serum N-glycomes and anti-carbohydrate antibodies from normal populations and oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) patients were investigated. Total serum proteins were lyophilized and subjected to chemical reduction, alkylation and trypsin digestion. The N-glycans were released, purified, permethylated, and analyzed using MALDI-TOF-Mass spectrometry. In addition, the serum anti-carbohydrate antibody profiles were also investigated by carbohydrate microarray. We found that the relative abundances of seven N-glycans were decreased or increased in serum of OSCC with diagnostic accuracy greater than 75%. The relative abundances of total tri-antennary and tetra-antennary glycans with varying degrees of fucosylation and sialylation were also increased in serum N-glycomes of OSCC. In an independent validation group of forty-eight OCCC patients, most of the high-molecular weight serum N-glycans showed significantly high sensitivity and specificity according to the identified cutoff values. Furthermore, the serum levels of two IgM antibodies were elevated accompanied with the decreased levels of nine IgG antibodies in patient serum. Taken together, these serum N-glycans and antibodies identified in this study should be considered as the candidates of potential biomarkers for OSCC diagnosis."

Using calorimetry, functional assays, and complementary structural techniques, we show that the central region of the protein, encompassing amino acids Asp-31–Arg-62, is the region mainly responsible for α-thrombin binding and inhibition. As previously reported for the Anopheles albimanus orthologue anophelin, cE5 binds both thrombin exosite I with segment Glu-35–Asp-47 and the catalytic site with the region Pro-49–Arg-56, which includes the highly conserved DPGR tetrapeptide.

https://openalex.org/W2623839919,"Background Randomized controlled trials (RCT) have shown no overall benefit of renal revascularization in atherosclerotic renovascular disease (ARVD). However, 25% of patients demonstrate improvement in renal function. We used the ratio of magnetic resonance parenchymal volume (PV) to isotopic single kidney glomerular filtration rate (isoSKGFR) ratio as our method to prospectively identify ""improvers"" before revascularization Methods Patients with renal artery stenosis who were due revascularization were recruited alongside non-ARVD hypertensive CKD controls. Using the controls, 95% CI were calculated for expected PV:isoSK-GFR at given renal volumes. For ARVD patients, “improvers” were defined as having both >15% and >1ml/min increase in isoSK-GFR at 4 months after revascularization. Sensitivity and specificity of PV:isoSK-GFR for predicting improvers was calculated. Results 30 patients (mean age 68 ±8 years), underwent revascularization, of whom 10 patients had intervention for bilateral RAS. Stented kidneys which manifested >15% improvement in function had larger PV:isoSK-GFR compared to controls (19±16 vs. 6±4ml/ml/min, p = 0.002). The sensitivity and specificity of this equation in predicting a positive renal functional outcome were 64% and 88% respectively. Use of PV:isoSK-GFR increased prediction of functional improvement (area under curve 0.93). Of note, non-RAS contralateral kidneys which improved (n = 5) also demonstrated larger PV:isoSK-GFR (15.2±16.2 ml/ml/min, p = 0.006). Conclusion This study offers early indicators that the ratio of PV:isoSK-GFR may help identify patients with kidneys suitable for renal revascularization which could improve patient selection for a procedure associated with risks. Calculation of the PV:isoSK-GFR ratio is easy, does not require MRI contrast agent."

We collected specimens from rocky shores of the north-east Atlantic Ocean (4 locations), Mediterranean Sea (8) and Black Sea (1). The 312 sequences 537 bp) of the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase I allowed to detect 130 haplotypes. High within-location genetic variability was recorded, with haplotype diversity ranging between h = 0.750 and 0.967. Parameters of genetic divergence, haplotype network and Bayesian assignment analysis were consistent in rejecting the hypothesis of panmixia. C. montagui is genetically structured in three geographically discrete populations, which corresponded to north-eastern Atlantic Ocean, western-central Mediterranean Sea, and Aegean Sea-Black Sea. These populations are separated by two main effective barriers to gene flow located at the Almeria-Oran Front and in correspondence of the Cyclades Islands. According to the ‘isolation with migration’ model, adjacent population pairs diverged during the early to middle Pleistocene transition, a period in which geological events provoked significant changes in the structure and composition of palaeocommunities. Mismatch distributions, neutrality tests and Bayesian skyline plots showed past population expansions, which started approximately in the Mindel-Riss interglacial, in which ecological conditions were favourable for temperate species and calcium-uptaking marine organisms."

The aim of the current study was to explore time-dependent changes in resting-state (rs) functional connectivity in motor-impaired stroke patients, using rs-functional MRI at 5 weeks and 26 weeks post-stroke onset. For this aim, 13 stroke patients from the EXPLICIT-stroke Trial and age and gender-matched healthy control subjects were included. Patients' synergistic motor control of the paretic upper-limb was assessed with the upper extremity section of the Fugl-Meyer Assessment (FMA-UE) within 2 weeks, and at 5 and 26 weeks post-stroke onset. Results showed that the ipsilesional rs-functional connectivity between motor areas was lower compared to the contralesional rs-functional connectivity, but this difference did not change significantly over time. No relations were observed between changes in rs-functional connectivity and upper-limb motor recovery, despite changes in upper-limb function as measured with the FMA-UE. Last, overall rs-functional connectivity was comparable for patients and healthy control subjects. To conclude, the current findings did not provide evidence that in moderately impaired stroke patients the lower rs-functional connectivity of the ipsilesional hemisphere changed over time."

In this study, we comprehensively analyzed heat shock–induced changes in proteome profiles of mouse fibrosarcoma RIF-1 cells by combining 2D-PAGE analysis with mass spectrometry. We found that heat shock causes dramatic changes in the PTMs in hnRNP K. We also found that hnRNP K inhibits the activity of heat shock–induced HSF1 by reducing its binding to HSE and that the redox regulation of hnRNP K at Cys132 is critical for this inhibition. To investigate proteins involved in early stage of HSR, post-translationally modified proteins under heat shock stress were examined. Mouse fibrosarcoma RIF-1 cells were treated with heat shock at 45 °C for 30 min and recovered for 4, 12, or 24 h at 37 °C. The cell lysates were separated on 2D-PAGE, and the protein spots were visualized by silver staining (supplemental Fig. S1A). 149 protein spots, differentially appearing in response to heat shock during recovery, were identified by peptide sequencing (supplemental Fig. S1, B and C) and quantified using image analysis software (supplemental Fig. S1, D and E). We classified the proteins that showed more than 1.3-fold increase after heat shock treatment into four groups according to how long they took (4, 12, or 24 h) to reach their maximum levels (Fig. 1A): proteins up-regulated more than 2-fold by 4 h and remained stable up to 24 h (type I); proteins up-regulated the most at 4 h and decreased thereafter (type II); proteins up-regulated the most by 12 h and then decreased (type III); and proteins up-regulated the most by 24 h (type IV). Because heat shock at 45 °C for 30 min inhibits the synthesis of most cellular proteins except for hsp family proteins for up to 6 h (27.Kim H.J. Lee K.J. Heat shock and ceramide have different apoptotic pathways in radiation induced fibrosarcoma (RIF) cells.Mol. Cell. Biochem. 2002; 229: 139-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), increased protein spots in 4 h recovery samples can be assumed to represent proteins post-translationally modified by heat shock. Therefore, the protein spots in types I and II are presumed to represent proteins with heat shock–induced PTMs that shifted on 2D gel by pI or molecular mass changes. hnRNP K was identified in five different spots on 2D gel, indicating several populations of cellular hnRNP K. Because four of these spots of the hnRNP K are of types I and II, we postulated that hnRNP K was post-translationally modified by heat shock. We selected four hsps and hnRNP K from the proteins in Fig. 1A and assessed their protein expression levels by 1D-PAGE separation and Western blot analysis (Fig. 1B). We found that hsp25, hsp70, hsp60, and hsp90β increased during recovery after heat shock. However, the level of hnRNP K protein was not changed by heat shock stress. This confirms that the changes of hnRNP K in 2D-PAGE analysis were not due to the changes in hnRNP K expression levels but are due to post-translational modifications induced by heat shock. We examined the heat shock–induced changes in the hnRNP K protein spots in silver-stained 2D-PAGE gel as well as in 2D-PAGE Western analysis in detail (Fig. 2A). From the Western analysis results, we identified more than 10 hnRNP K populations. Among the four major spots (spots 1–4), spots 2 and 4 decreased at 4 h recovery after heat shock but were restored at 12 h after heat shock (Fig. 2, A and B). This decrease was also seen immediately after heat shock treatment (Fig. 2C). Other stress treatments such as a proteasome inhibitor MG132 and ionizing radiation did not cause this decrease in the two hnRNP K spots (Fig. 2, D and E), suggesting that these changes are specific effects of heat shock stress. We attempted to comprehensively identify the PTMs representing each hnRNP K spot. We employed peptide sequencing with nanoUPLC-ESI-q-TOF MS/MS, employing selectively excluded mass screening analysis (SEMSA) for sensitive detection of low abundant PTMs (28.Seo J. Jeong J. Kim Y.M. Hwang N. Paek E. Lee K.J.

These findings are summarized in Table 1 with representative MS/MS spectra (supplemental Fig. S2) and also presented in a schematic diagram (Fig. 3A). Phosphorylations at Ser36, Thr70, Tyr72, Ser89, Ser91, Thr107, Ser116, Ser154, Ser379, Thr438, and Thr442; acetylations at Lys52, Lys198, Lys219, and Lys405; and methylation at Arg316 were detected. Among these modifications, phosphorylation of Tyr72 was previously reported (23.Ostareck-Lederer A. Ostareck D.H. Cans C. Neubauer G. Bomsztyk K. Superti-Furga G. Hentze M.W. c-Src-mediated phosphorylation of hnRNP K drives translational activation of specifically silenced mRNAs.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 4535-4543Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Phosphorylations at Thr70, Tyr72, Ser89/Ser91, and Thr438/Thr442 and acetylation at Lys219 were decreased by heat shock treatment. In addition, various modifications of Cys including novel oxidation (30.Jeong J. Jung Y. Na S. Jeong J. Lee E. Kim M.S. Choi S. Shin D.H. Paek E. Lee H.Y. Lee K.J.

These included modifications of Cys132 to dehydroalanine and sulfonic acid; Cys145 to dehydroalanine and Cys-SO2-SH (Δm = +64 Da); and Cys184/185 to dehydroalanine and sulfonic acid. This is the first report on PTMs of Cys residues in hnRNP K. We concentrated on heat shock-dependent (in red in Fig. 3B) and spots 2- and 4-specific (in bold in Fig. 3B and Table 2) PTMs, because these two spots disappeared after heat shock and reappeared during recovery (Fig. 2A).

Our finding that hnRNP K is the most dramatically changed protein in response to heat shock stress and recovery suggests that hnRNP K plays a key role in HSR. To investigate whether hnRNP K affects the transcriptional activity of HSF1, a major player in HSR, we examined the effect of overexpressing hnRNP K and its mutants on hsp27 mRNA levels. HEK293T cells overexpressing Flag-hnRNP K and its Cys mutants, C132S and C145S, were exposed to heat shock, and cellular levels of hsp27 mRNA were quantified and normalized to GAPDH mRNA level by RT-qPCR. Heat shock–induced hsp27 mRNA 4-fold more in cells overexpressing empty Flag vector but significantly inhibited it in cells overexpressing Flag-hnRNP K (Fig. 4A). In contrast, expression of hnRNP K C132S mutant, but not C145S, showed moderate inhibitory effect on hsp27 mRNA induction. The overexpression of each protein was confirmed by Western analysis using anti-Flag antibody (Fig. 4B). We also tested trioxidation mimic hnRNP K mutants, Flag-hnRNP K C132D and C132E mutants in HEK293T cells (Fig. 4C), and Flag-hnRNP K C132D mutant in HeLa cells (Fig. 4, E and F). These mutants showed moderate inhibitory effect on hsp70 and hsp27 mRNA expression in comparison to wild-type Flag-hnRNP K. The overexpression of each protein was confirmed by Western analysis using anti-Flag antibody (Fig. 4, D and G). Neither the oxidation-free form or the constitutive sulfonic acid mimic form of hnRNP K inhibited hsp70 and hsp27 mRNA expression as much as wild-type hnRNP K in heat shock–treated cells. This suggests that Cys132 in hnRNP K, a redox-sensitive Cys residue, is required for the inhibition of HSF1 in heat shock response; however, the oxidation status of Cys132 cannot be simply explained as a function of a fixed oxidation-free form or a sulfonic acid–mimicking form of hnRNP K. We then tested whether depletion of hnRNP K promoted hsp70 and hsp27 mRNA expression in HeLa cells. As shown in Fig. 4, H and I, the heat shock–induced hsp70 and hsp27 mRNA levels were considerably enhanced in cells in which hnRNP K was knocked down. The depletion of hnRNP K using siRNA was confirmed by Western analysis (Fig. 4J). We confirmed the increase of hsp mRNA in cells depleted of hnRNP K by demonstrating the converse by restoring hnRNP K. HeLa cells depleted of endogenous hnRNP K with siRNA were transfected with Flag-hnRNP K or Flag-hnRNP K mutant C132S and exposed to heat shock. Heat shock–induced hsp70 mRNA was significantly increased in cells in which hnRNP K was knocked down, and this increase was abolished by adding hnRNP K but not the hnRNP K mutant C132S (Fig. 4K). The depletion of hnRNP K and overexpression of hnRNP K was confirmed by Western analysis (Fig. 4L). These results demonstrate that hnRNP K inhibits heat shock–induced hsp70 and hsp27 mRNA expression and that Cys132 plays a critical role in this inhibitory process. To determine whether the inhibitory effect of hnRNP K on heat shock–induced hsp70 and hsp27 mRNA expression is due to changes in HSF1 mRNA levels, we examined HSF1 mRNA levels in hnRNP K overexpressing HEK293T cells. HSF1 mRNA levels did not correlate with the amount of hnRNP K (Fig. 4M). This indicates that hnRNP K–induced inhibition of hsp70 and hsp27 mRNA expression was not caused by the reduction of HSF1 mRNA expression. It is well known that heat shock activation leads to the appearance of various PTMs in HSF1 (31.Akerfelt M. Morimoto R.I. Sistonen L. Heat shock factors: integrators of cell stress, development and lifespan.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2010; 11: 545-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (962) Google Scholar). Active phosphorylated HSF1 can be readily detected by the appearance of a higher molecular mass band on 1D SDS-PAGE. To determine whether hnRNP K affects initial activation of HSF1, we sought to detect active form of HSF1 after heat shock in the presence and absence of Flag-hnRNP K in HEK293T cells. HSF1 band shifts to an upper position of a phosphorylated form immediately after heat shock and returns to the original position after 6 h of recovery in Flag empty vector-transfected control cells (Fig. 5A, top two panels). The HSF1 activation kinetics in cells overexpressing Flag-hnRNP K and its C132S mutant were identical to that in control cells transfected with empty vector (Fig. 5A, center and bottom sets of panels). The activation kinetics of HSF1 were also identical in both HeLa cells in which hnRNP K was knocked down and control cells (Fig. 5B). These results suggest that hnRNP K does not affect heat shock–induced HSF1 PTM-dependent initial activation. Because activated HSF1 forms trimers and translocates from cytosol to nucleus, we investigated whether hnRNP K regulates the translocation of activated HSF1. HEK293T cells overexpressing Flag-hnRNP K and its mutant C132S were exposed to heat shock, and cell lysates were fractionated into cytosolic and nuclear fractions (Fig. 5C). HSF1 was mainly located in cytosol prior to heat shock and translocated into nucleus after heat shock treatment. Heat shock–induced translocation into nucleus was not affected by overexpression of hnRNP K or its C132S mutant (Fig. 5C) or by depletion of hnRNP K in HeLa cells (Fig. 5D). These findings indicate that hnRNP K does not modulate translocation of the active HSF1 from the cytosol to nucleus. HSF1 translocates to the nucleus, binds to HSE, and activates hsp genes. We investigated, employing the hsp70 reporter and ChIP assays, whether hnRNP K inhibits HSF1 binding to HSE. hsp70 reporter assay was performed with HA-HSF1 overexpression in the presence or absence of hnRNP K in HeLa cells. HA-HSF1 overexpression increased the luciferase activity. Depletion of hnRNP K augmented both basal and HA-HSF1-induced activities of the reporter (Fig. 6A). This suggests that hnRNP K negatively regulates HSF1 transcriptional activity. To investigate whether hnRNP K affects the binding of HSF1 to HSE, we employed ChIP assay using anti-HSF1 antibody. HEK293T cells overexpressing Flag-hnRNP K or the C132S mutant were exposed to heat shock, and the cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-HSF1 antibody or control rabbit IgG. Immunoprecipitated HSE was quantified using real-time qPCR. Heat shock treatment increased HSF1 binding to HSE as previously reported (32.Trinklein N.D. Chen W.C. Kingston R.E. Myers R.M. Transcriptional regulation and binding of heat shock factor 1 and heat shock factor 2 to 32 human heat shock genes during thermal stress and differentiation.Cell Stress Chaperones. 2004; 9: 21-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, overexpression of hnRNP K decreased the HSF1-HSE binding in heat shock–treated cells. This inhibition was attenuated in cells overexpressing Flag-hnRNP K C132S (Fig. 6B). Because hnRNP K inhibits HSF1 binding to HSE, we investigated whether hnRNP K interaction with HSF1 inhibits the binding of HSF1 to HSE or whether hnRNP K competes with HSF1 for binding to the HSE region. First, we overexpressed HA-HSF1 with Flag empty vector, Flag-hnRNP K, or Flag-hnRNP K C132S treated with or without heat shock, and performed co-immunoprecipitation using anti-Flag antibody. Flag-hnRNP K bound to HA-HSF1 regardless of heat shock treatment, but Flag-hnRNP K C132S mutant did not bind to HA-HSF1 in heat shock–treated cells (Fig. 6C). Second, we performed ChIP assays using anti-HSF1 antibody and monoclonal and ChIP grade polyclonal anti-hnRNP K antibodies to test HSF1 and hnRNP K binding to HSE. Unlike anti-HSF1 antibody, both anti-hnRNP K antibodies recruited negligible amounts of HSE (Fig. 6D). We also tested a wider range of DNA sequences than the 173 bp detected in Fig. 6D, including 96 bp upstream of the 173 bp (total 269 bp), but neither hnRNP K antibody recruited the HSE-containing DNA region (Fig. 6E). This means hnRNP K does not have the ability to bind to the HSE region. These results indicate that hnRNP K inhibits HSF1 binding to HSE by forming a protein complex with HSF1. As hnRNP K is a member of protein complex hnRNP, we tested the relationship between other hnRNP members and HSF1. We transfected Flag or Flag-HSF1 and performed co-immunoprecipitation with anti-Flag antibody. When Flag-HSF1 bound to endogenous hnRNP K specifically, endogenous hnRNP A1 nor hnRNP C1/C2 did not show any specific binding to Flag-HSF1 (Fig. 6F). This suggests that HSF1 interacts with hnRNP K specifically, not hnRNP complex. To investigate whether RNA is necessary for the HSF1 and hnRNP K binding, we examined these interaction in cells overexpressing HA-HSF1 with Flag empty vector or Flag-hnRNP K with co-immunoprecipitation using anti-F"

The sample was comprised of pre-treatment cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) images of fifty-five patients. The CBCTs were used to construct 3D surface models of the maxillary incisors. The reproducibility of surface models was tested by repeated construction of them by two observers. A 3D surface model that corresponded to the average of all lateral and all central incisors was generated. 3D surface distances and vector differences were calculated for each individual tooth and the average of the teeth considered. The corresponding points on the 3D surface mesh for each subgroup were compared statistically to those of the neutral subgroup using shape analysis MANCOVA and Hotelling’s t-statistic (p < 0.05). Repeated construction of surface models demonstrated adequate inter-rater reproducibility. The distribution of 3D models into root morphology subgroups was: blunt (11% and 26% of the central and lateral incisors, respectively), conical (15% of the central incisors), long (27% and 20% of the central and lateral incisors, respectively), and short (15% and 4% of the central and lateral incisors, respectively). Compared to the neutral average, statistically significant differences in root morphology were found for blunt, long, conical, and short central incisors and for blunt, long, and short lateral incisors. We can conclude that 3D surface models construction for upper incisors is reproducible. 3D shape analysis using CBCT images allows a phenotypic characterization of incisor root morphology."

Presence of HIT was defined as a positive functional heparin-induced platelet aggregation test. Diagnostic accuracy was determined for low, intermediate and high thresholds as previously established (ELISA: optical density 0.4, 1.3, and 2.0 respectively; PaGIA: positive/negative, titre of 4, titre of 32; AcuStar HIT-IgG: 1.0 U/ml, 2.8, 9.4) and reproducibility was assessed by repeated measurements. Costs of test determination were calculated taking reagents, controls, and working time of technicians according to Swiss health care system into account.Data on PaGIA results were available for 171 patients (95.5%), ELISA for 144 patients (80.4%), and AcuStar HIT-IgG for 179 patients (100%). Sensitivity was above 95% for all assays at low and intermediate thresholds. Specificity increased with higher thresholds and was above 90% for all assays with intermediate and high thresholds. Specificity of AcuStar HIT-IgG (92.8%; 95% CI 87.7, 96.2) was significantly higher than PaGIA (83.0%; 95% CI 76.3, 88.5) and higher than ELISA (81.8%, 95% CI 74.2, 88.0) at low threshold (p<0.05). Reproducibility was adequate for all assays. Total costs per test were CHF 51.02 for ELISA, 117.70 for AcuStar HIT-IgG, and 83.13 for PaGIA.We observed favourable diagnostic accuracy measures and a high reproducibility for PaGIA and AcuStar HIT-IgG.

https://openalex.org/W2622517225,"Introduction Early defibrillation is an important factor of survival in cardiac arrest. However, novice resuscitators often struggle with cardiac arrest patients. We investigated factors leading to delayed defibrillation performed by final-year medical students within a simulated bystander cardiac arrest situation. Methods Final-year medical students received a refresher lecture and basic life support training before being confronted with a simulated cardiac arrest situation in a simulation ambulance. The scenario was analyzed for factors leading to delayed defibrillation. We compared the time intervals the participants needed for various measures with a benchmark set by experienced resuscitators. After training, the participants were interviewed regarding challenges and thoughts during the scenario. Results The median time needed for defibrillation was 158 s (n = 49, interquartile range: 107–270 s), more than six-fold of the benchmark time. The major part of total defibrillation time (49%; median, n = 49) was between onset of ventricular fibrillation and beginning to prepare the defibrillator, more specifically the time between end of preparation of the defibrillator and actual delivery of the shock, with a mean proportion of 26% (n = 49, SD = 17%) of the overall time needed for defibrillation (maximum 67%). Self-reported reasons for this delay included uncertainty about the next step to take, as reported by 73% of the participants. A total of 35% were unsure about which algorithm to follow. Diagnosing the patient was subjectively difficult for 35% of the participants. Overall, 53% of the participants felt generally confused. Conclusions Our study shows that novice resuscitators rarely achieve guideline-recommended defibrillation times. The most relative delays were observed when participants had to choose what to do next or which algorithm to follow, and thus i.e. performed extensive airway management before a life-saving defibrillation. Our data provides a first insight in the process of defibrillation delay and can be used to generate new hypotheses on how to provide a timely defibrillation."
https://openalex.org/W2622848970,"Alcohol is metabolized in the liver via the enzymes alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) and aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH). Polymorphisms in the genes encoding these enzymes, which are common in East Asian populations, can alter enzyme kinetics and hence the risk of alcohol dependence and its sequelae. One of the most important genetic variants, in this regards, is the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs671 in ALDH2, the gene encoding the primary acetaldehyde metabolizing enzyme ALDH2. However, the protective allele of rs671 is absent in most Europeans although ALDH1B1, which shares significant sequence homology with ALDH2, contains several, potentially functional, missense SNPs that do occur in European populations. The aims of this study were: (i) to use bioinformatic techniques to characterize the possible effects of selected variants in ALDH1B1 on protein structure and function; and, (ii) to genotype three missense and one stop-gain, protein-altering, non-synonymous SNPs in 1478 alcohol dependent cases and 1254 controls of matched British and Irish ancestry. No significant allelic associations were observed between the three missense SNPs and alcohol dependence risk. The minor allele frequency of rs142427338 (Gln378Ter) was higher in alcohol dependent cases than in controls (allelic P = 0.19, OR = 2.98, [0.62-14.37]) but as this SNP is very rare the study was likely underpowered to detect an association with alcohol dependence risk. This potential association will needs to be further evaluated in other large, independent European populations."

GRN+/A152T+ and GRN+/A152T- patients shared similar clinical and neuropsychological features and plasma progranulin levels. All were diagnosed with an FTD disorder, including behavioral variant FTD or non fluent / agrammatic variant primary progressive aphasia, and shared a similar pattern of neuropsychological deficits, predominantly in executive function, memory, and language. All seven participants with available brain autopsies (6 GRN+/A152T+, 1 GRN+/A152T-) showed frontotemporal lobar degeneration with TDP-43 inclusions (type A classification), which is characteristic of GRN carriers. Additionally, all seven showed mild to moderate tau inclusion burden: five cases lacked β-amyloid pathology and two cases had Alzheimer's pathology. The co-occurrence of both genes within one individual is recent, with the birth of the first GRN+/A152T+ individual estimated to be within the last 50 generations (95% probability).In our sample, the p.A152T MAPT variant does not appear to show a discernible influence on the clinical phenotype of GRN carriers. Whether p.A152T confers a greater than expected propensity for tau pathology in these GRN carriers remains an open question."

https://openalex.org/W2622314756,"This study investigates the basic characteristics and proposes a concept for the complex system of geographical conditions (CSGC). By analyzing the DPSIR model and its correlation with the index system, we selected indexes for geographical conditions according to the resources, ecology, environment, economy and society parameters to build a system. This system consists of four hierarchies: index, classification, element and target levels. We evaluated the elements or indexes of the complex system using the TOPSIS method and a general model coordinating multiple complex systems. On this basis, the coordination analysis experiment of geographical conditions is applied to cities in the Henan province in China. The following conclusions were reached: ①According to the pressure, state and impact of geographical conditions, relatively consistent measures are taken around the city, but with conflicting results. ②The coordination degree of geographical conditions is small among regions showing large differences in classification index value. The degree of coordination of such regions is prone to extreme values; however, the smaller the difference the larger the coordination degree. ③The coordinated development of geographical conditions in the Henan province is at the stage of the point axis."

https://openalex.org/W2623077852,"Video based object recognition and classification has been widely studied in computer vision and image processing area. One main issue of this task is to develop an effective representation for video. This problem can generally be formulated as image set representation. In this paper, we present a new method called Multiple Covariance Discriminative Learning (MCDL) for image set representation and classification problem. The core idea of MCDL is to represent an image set using multiple covariance matrices with each covariance matrix representing one cluster of images. Firstly, we use the Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (NMF) method to do image clustering within each image set, and then adopt Covariance Discriminative Learning on each cluster (subset) of images. At last, we adopt KLDA and nearest neighborhood classification method for image set classification. Promising experimental results on several datasets show the effectiveness of our MCDL method."
