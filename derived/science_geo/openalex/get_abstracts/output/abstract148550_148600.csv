Epidemiological evidence indicates that mucosal exposure is an important aspect of intrapartum HIV transmission. A simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) macaque model has been developed that mimics the mucosal exposure that can occur during intrapartum HIV-1 transmission. To develop immunoprophylaxis against intrapartum HIV-1 transmission, we used SHIV-vpu+ (refs. 5,6), a chimeric simian-human virus that encodes the env gene of HIV-IIIB. Several combinations of human monoclonal antibodies against HIV-1 have been identified that neutralize SHIV-vpu+ completely in vitro through synergistic interaction. Here, we treated four pregnant macaques with a triple combination of the human IgG1 monoclonal antibodies F105, 2G12 and 2F5. All four macaques were protected against intravenous SHIV-vpu+ challenge after delivery. The infants received monoclonal antibodies after birth and were challenged orally with SHIV-vpu+ shortly thereafter. We found no evidence of infection in any infant during 6 months of follow-up. This demonstrates that IgG1 monoclonal antibodies protect against mucosal lentivirus challenge in neonates. We conclude that epitopes recognized by the three monoclonal antibodies are important determinants for achieving substantial protection, thus providing a rational basis for AIDS vaccine development."

https://openalex.org/W2009301053,"Activation of calcium-ion (Ca2+) channels on the plasma membrane and on intracellular Ca2+ stores, such as the endoplasmic reticulum, generates local transient increases in the cytosolic Ca2+ concentration that induce Ca2+ uptake by neighbouring mitochondria. Here, by using mitochondrially targeted aequorin proteins with different Ca2+ affinities, we show that half of the chromaffin-cell mitochondria exhibit surprisingly rapid millimolar Ca2+ transients upon stimulation of cells with acetylcholine, caffeine or high concentrations of potassium ions. Our results show a tight functional coupling of voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels on the plasma membrane, ryanodine receptors on the endoplasmic reticulum, and mitochondria. Cell stimulation generates localized Ca2+ transients, with Ca2+ concentrations above 20-40 microM, at these functional units. Protonophores abolish mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake and increase stimulated secretion of catecholamines by three- to fivefold. These results indicate that mitochondria modulate secretion by controlling the availability of Ca2+ for exocytosis."

https://openalex.org/W2092104384,"The adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene is mutated in familial adenomatous polyposis and in many sporadic colorectal tumors. The carboxyl-terminal S/TXV motif of the APC gene product interacts with the PDZ domain of hDLG, the human homolog of the Drosophila lethal (1) discs larige-1 (dlg) tumor suppressor. In the present study, we found that overexpression of hDLG suppresses cell proliferation by blocking cell cycle progression from the G0/G1 to S phase. This inhibition of cell cycle progression was abolished when the PDZ, SH3 or guanylate kinase-like domain of hDLG was mutated. Moreover, overexpression of these mutant hDLGs partially interfered with the cell cycle blocking activity of APC. Consistent with this result, mutant APC lacking the S/TXV motif exhibited weaker cell cycle blocking activity than the intact APC. These results suggest that APC-hDLG complex formation plays an important role in transducing the APC cell cycle blocking signal."

https://openalex.org/W1976749826,"Transcription factor c-Myb plays important roles in cell survival and differentiation in immature hematopoietic cells. Here we demonstrate that c-Myb is acetylated at the carboxyl-terminal conserved domain by histone acetyltransferase p300 both in vitro and in vivo. The acetylation sites in vivo have been located at the lysine residues of the conserved domain (K471, K480, K485) by the use of the mutant Myb (Myb-KAmut), in which all three lysine residues are substituted into alanine. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay reveals that Myb-KAmut shows higher DNA binding activity than wild type c-Myb and that acetylation of c-Myb in vitro by p300 causes dramatic increase in DNA binding activity. Accordingly, transactivation activity of both mim-1 and CD34 promoters by Myb-KAmut is higher than that driven by wild type c-Myb. Furthermore, the bromodomain of p300, in addition to the histone acetyltransferase (HAT) domain, is required for effective acetylation of c-Myb, and hGCN5 is revealed to be a factor acetyltransferase for c-Myb in vitro. We present a new manner of post-translational modification of the c-Myb protein and the potential significance of the acetylation in c-Myb."
https://openalex.org/W2043104386,"Ionizing radiation is a well known risk factor of thyroid cancer development, but the mechanism of radiation induced carcinogenesis is not clear. The RET/PTC oncogene, an activated form of the RET proto-oncogene, is frequently observed in papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC); RET/PTC1, -2 and -3 are known to be the three major forms. High frequencies of RET/PTC rearrangements have been observed in radiation-associated PTC, such as those appearing post-Chernobyl or post-radiotherapy, but the rearrangement types differ between these two populations. We investigated whether a specific type of RET/PTC rearrangement was induced by X-rays in vivo and in vitro. In human normal thyroid tissues transplanted in scid mice, the RET/PTC1 rearrangement was predominantly detected throughout the observation period (up to 60 days) after X-ray exposure of 50 Gy. On the other hand, RET/PTC3 was detected only 7 days after X-irradiation, and no transcript of RET/PTC2 was detected. These results are supported by the results of an in vitro study. The RET/PTC1 rearrangement was preferentially induced in a dose-dependent manner by X-rays within a high dose range (10, 50 and 100 Gy) in four cell lines. On the other hand, RET/PTC3 was induced at a much lower frequency, and no induction of RET/PTC2 was observed. These results suggest that the preferential induction of the RET/PTC1 rearrangement may play an important role in the early steps of thyroid carcinogenesis induced by acute X-irradiation."
https://openalex.org/W2071649852,"We recently isolated a cDNA for hpttg, the human homolog of rat pituitary tumor transforming gene. Now we have analysed the expression of hpttg as a function of cell proliferation. hPTTG protein level is up-regulated in rapidly proliferating cells, is down-regulated in response to serum starvation or cell confluence, and is regulated in a cell cycle-dependent manner, peaking in mitosis. In addition, we show that hPTTG is phosphorylated during mitosis. Immunodepletion and in vitro phosphorylation experiments, together with the use of a specific inhibitor, indicate that Cdc2 is the kinase that phosphorylates hPTTG. These results suggest that hpttg is induced by, and may have a role in, regulatory pathways involved in the control of cell proliferation."
https://openalex.org/W2313594305,"The activity of the tumor suppressor p53 is induced in response to DNA-damaging agents such as UV and Î³ radiation. Phosphorylation is one of the key regulatory steps for activating p53 function. Recent reports have shown that p53 is phosphorylated at both serines 15 and 392 in response to UV radiation. Phosphorylation at serine 15 prevents the binding of HDM2, a negative regulator of p53. Phosphorylation at serine 392 induces the DNA-binding function of p53. We examined the requirement for phosphorylation at both serines and show that both these modifications occur on the same molecule of p53. In vitro assays demonstrate that phosphorylation at either one of these sites is not sufficient to yield an active p53. Phosphorylation by DNA-PK, that modifies serines 15 and 37, inhibits HDM2 binding to p53 but does not induce the DNA-binding activity of p53. Phosphorylation at serine 392, on the other hand, stimulates the DNA-binding ability of p53 but does not make it immune to binding and inhibition by HDM2. Thus, our results demonstrate that multiple sites need to be modified to yield a functional p53."
https://openalex.org/W2079649151,"alpha-Actinins are actin-binding proteins important in organization of the cytoskeleton and in cell adhesion. We have cloned and characterized a cDNA from human neuroblastoma cell variants which encodes the second non-muscle alpha-actinin isoform designated ACTN4 (actinin-4). mRNA encoded by the ACTN4 gene, mapped to chromosome 4, is abundant in non-tumorigenic, substrate-adherent human neuroblastoma cell variants but absent or only weakly expressed in malignant, poorly substrate-adherent neuroblasts. It is also present in many adherent tumor cell lines of diverse tissue origins. Cell lines typically co-express ACTN4 and ACTN1, a second non-muscle alpha-actinin gene. Expression is correlated with substrate adhesivity. Analysis of deduced amino acid sequences suggests that the two isoforms may differ in function and in regulation by calcium. Moreover, ACTN4 exhibits tumor suppressor activity. Stable clones containing increased levels of alpha-actinin, isolated from highly malignant neuroblastoma stem cells [BE(2)-C] after transfection with a full-length ACTN4 cDNA, show decreased anchorage-independent growth ability, loss of tumorigenicity in nude mice, and decreased expression of the N-myc proto-oncogene."

https://openalex.org/W2329820193,"A major obstacle in the systemic treatment of advanced malignant melanoma is its intrinsic resistance to conventionally used chemotherapeutic agents. In order to investigate the mechanisms of this intrinsic resistance, we have previously utilized retroviral insertional mutagenesis on an early-stage, drug sensitive human melanoma cell line (WM35) to establish mutated cell lines that exhibited increased resistance to cis-diammi-nedichloroplatinum(II) (CDDP). Here, we demonstrate that this increased resistance to CDDP is mediated by the over-expression of tyrosinase-related protein-2 (TYRP2), an enzyme that normally functions in the biosynthesis of the pigment, melanin. Northern and Western blot analyses revealed that the expression of TYRP2 in the virally-derived cell lines as well as in a panel of human melanoma cell lines positively correlated with their levels of resistance to CDDP. Furthermore, enforced expression of TYRP2 in WM35 cells by transfection elevated their resistance to CDDP. The increased CDDP resistance in the virally-derived clones and TYRP2 transfectants was accompanied by a reduction in CDDP-induced apoptosis. Interestingly, the virally-derived CDDP-resistant clones also showed cross resistance to carboplatin and methotrexate, but not taxol, suggesting that TYRP2 over-expression may confer resistance specifically to DNA damaging agents. Overall, these results demonstrate a novel mechanism of drug resistance in human melanoma cells that is mediated by the over-expression of TYRP2. Since TYRP2 is expressed only in cells of melanocytic lineage, this may represent the first report of a lineage-specific mechanism of drug resistance. In summary, these findings suggest a significant role for TYRP2 in the intrinsic drug resistance phenotype of human melanoma cells and may have important implications in the development of chemosensitization strategies for the clinical management of this disease."
https://openalex.org/W2019824848,"B-Myb is a transcription factor belonging to the myb family, whose activity has been associated with augmented DNA synthesis and cell cycle progression. We showed recently that B-Myb autoregulates its own expression through promoter transactivation. We report in this study that CDK9, the cyclin T associated kinase, which phosphorylates and activates RNA-Polymerase II, suppresses B-Myb autoregulation through direct interaction with the carboxyl-terminus of the B-Myb protein. Down-regulation of the transactivating ability of B-Myb is independent of the kinase activity of CDK9, because a kinase deficient mutant (dn-CDK9) also represses B-myb gene autoregulation. Overexpression of CDK9 did not result in suppression of p53-dependent transactivation or inhibition of the basal activity of the promoters tested so far, demonstrating that CDK9 is a B-Myb-specific repressor. Rather, transfection of the dominant negative dn-CDK9 construct inhibited the basal activity of the reporter genes, confirming an essential role for CDK9 in gene transcription. In addition, Cyclin T1 restores B-Myb transactivating activity when co-transfected along with CDK9, suggesting that the down-regulatory effect observed on B-Myb is specifically due to CDK9 alone. Thus, our data suggest that CDK9 is involved in the negative regulation of activated transcription mediated by certain transcription factors, such as B-Myb. This may indicate the existence of a feedback loop, mediated by the different activities of CDK9, which links basal with activated transcription."

https://openalex.org/W2327977919,"The p53 tumour suppressor induces cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in response to cellular stresses. p53 is inactivated by various cellular and viral factors. We set out to generate regulatable p53 derivatives that are highly inducible by synthetic ligands, escape inactivation and efficiently induce apoptosis. We have generated Ligand Inducible Chimeric Tumour Suppressors (LI-CTS), that are inactive unless provided with artificial ligands. They are resistant to inactivation, due to the replacement of domains that mediate p53 inhibition by heterologous sequences. LI-CTS are activated by micromolar concentrations of ligand in a variety of cell lines. Following ligand addition, they translocate to the nucleus, activate p53 inducible genes and induce apoptosis. We have established human head and neck squamous cell carcinoma lines that stably express LI-CTS, which are inducible. These lines form tumours in nude mice in the absence of ligand. Addition of ligand inhibits tumour formation, and moreover, regresses established tumours by apoptosis. Although regulatable p53 expression has been achieved previously, our study provides the first demonstration of regulatable in vivo regression of tumours in a p53 based approach. Regulated inhibition and regression of tumours with a ligand inducible chimeric tumour suppressor could provide a novel approach to p53 based gene therapy."
