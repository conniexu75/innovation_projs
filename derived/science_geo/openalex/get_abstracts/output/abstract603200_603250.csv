https://openalex.org/W2786378174,"Cohort studies with metabolomics data are becoming more widespread, however, large-scale studies involving 10,000s of participants are still limited, especially in Asian populations. Therefore, we started the Tsuruoka Metabolomics Cohort Study enrolling 11,002 community-dwelling adults in Japan, and using capillary electrophoresis-mass spectrometry (CE-MS) and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. The CE-MS method is highly amenable to absolute quantification of polar metabolites, however, its reliability for large-scale measurement is unclear. The aim of this study is to examine reproducibility and validity of large-scale CE-MS measurements. In addition, the study presents absolute concentrations of polar metabolites in human plasma, which can be used in future as reference ranges in a Japanese population.Metabolomic profiling of 8,413 fasting plasma samples were completed using CE-MS, and 94 polar metabolites were structurally identified and quantified. Quality control (QC) samples were injected every ten samples and assessed throughout the analysis. Inter- and intra-batch coefficients of variation of QC and participant samples, and technical intraclass correlation coefficients were estimated. Passing-Bablok regression of plasma concentrations by CE-MS on serum concentrations by standard clinical chemistry assays was conducted for creatinine and uric acid.In QC samples, coefficient of variation was less than 20% for 64 metabolites, and less than 30% for 80 metabolites out of the 94 metabolites. Inter-batch coefficient of variation was less than 20% for 81 metabolites. Estimated technical intraclass correlation coefficient was above 0.75 for 67 metabolites. The slope of Passing-Bablok regression was estimated as 0.97 (95% confidence interval: 0.95, 0.98) for creatinine and 0.95 (0.92, 0.96) for uric acid. Compared to published data from other large cohort measurement platforms, reproducibility of metabolites common to the platforms was similar to or better than in the other studies. These results show that our CE-MS platform is suitable for conducting large-scale epidemiological studies."
https://openalex.org/W2784447246,"The role of the cervicovaginal (CV) microbiome in regulating cervical function during pregnancy is poorly understood. Gardnerella vaginalis (G. vaginalis) is the most common bacteria associated with the diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis (BV). While BV has been associated with preterm birth (PTB), clinical trials targeting BV do not decrease PTB rates. It remains unknown if G. vaginalis is capable of triggering molecular, biomechanical and cellular events that could lead to PTB. The objective of this study was to determine if cervicovaginal colonization with G. vaginalis, in pregnant mice, induced cervical remodeling and modified cervical function. CD-1 timed-pregnant mice received a 5X108 CFU/mL intravaginal inoculation of G. vaginalis or control on embryonic day 12 (E12) and E13. On E15, the mice were sacrificed and cervicovaginal fluid (CVF), amniotic fluid (AF), cervix, uterus, placentas and fetal membranes (FM) were collected. Genomic DNA was isolated from the CVF, placenta, uterus and FM and QPCR was performed to confirm colonization. IL-6 was measured in the CVF and AF and soluble e-cadherin (seCAD) was assessed in the CVF by ELISA. RNA was extracted from the cervices to evaluate IL-10, IL-8, IL-1β, TNF-α, Tff-1, SPINK-5, HAS-1 and LOX expression via QPCR. Mucicarmine and trichrome staining was used to assess cervical mucin and collagen. Biomechanical properties of the cervix were studied using quasi-static tensile load-to-failure biomechanical tests. G. vaginalis successfully colonized the CV space. This colonization induced immune responses (increased IL-6 levels in CVF and AF, increased mRNA expression of cervical cytokines), altered the epithelial barrier (increased seCAD in the CVF), induced cervical remodeling (increased mucin production, altered collagen) and altered cervical biomechanical properties (a decrease in biomechanical modulus and an increase in maximum strain). The ability of G. vaginalis to induce these molecular, immune, cellular and biomechanical changes suggests that this bacterium may play a pathogenic role in premature cervical remodeling leading to PTB."
https://openalex.org/W2784758722,"Objective To evaluate the impact of using a ‘virtual clinic’ on patient experience and cost in the care of women with urinary incontinence. Materials and methods Women, aged > 18 years referred to a urogynaecology unit were randomised to either (1) A Standard Clinic or (2) A Virtual Clinic. Both groups completed a validated, web-based interactive, patient-reported outome measure (ePAQ-Pelvic Floor), in advance of their appointment followed by either a telephone consultation (Virtual Clinic) or face-to-face consultation (Standard Care). The primary outcome was the mean ‘short-term outcome scale’ score on the Patient Experience Questionnaire (PEQ). Secondary Outcome Measures included the other domains of the PEQ (Communications, Emotions and Barriers), Client Satisfaction Questionnaire (CSQ), Short-Form 12 (SF-12), personal, societal and NHS costs. Results 195 women were randomised: 98 received the intervention and 97 received standard care. The primary outcome showed a non-significant difference between the two study arms. No significant differences were also observed on the CSQ and SF-12. However, the intervention group showed significantly higher PEQ domain scores for Communications, Emotions and Barriers (including following adjustment for age and parity). Whilst standard care was overall more cost-effective, this was minimal (£38.04). The virtual clinic also significantly reduced consultation time (10.94 minutes, compared with a mean duration of 25.9 minutes respectively) and consultation costs compared to usual care (£31.75 versus £72.17 respectively), thus presenting potential cost-savings in out-patient management. Conclusions The virtual clinical had no impact on the short-term dimension of the PEQ and overall was not as cost-effective as standard care, due to greater clinic re-attendances in this group. In the virtual clinic group, consultation times were briefer, communication experience was enhanced and personal costs lower. For medical conditions of a sensitive or intimate nature, a virtual clinic has potential to support patients to communicate with health professionals about their condition."
https://openalex.org/W2793679760,"Micro RNAs (miRNAs) are promising disease biomarkers due to their high stability. Their expression in serum is altered in type 1 diabetes, but whether deviations exist in individuals with high risk for type 1 diabetes remains unexplored. We therefore assessed serum miRNAs in high-risk individuals (n = 21) positive for multiple islet autoantibodies, age-matched healthy children (n = 17) and recent-onset type 1 diabetes patients (n = 8), using Serum/Plasma Focus microRNA PCR Panels from Exiqon. The miRNA levels in the high-risk group were similar to healthy controls, and no specific miRNA profile was identified for the high-risk group. However, serum miRNAs appeared to reflect glycemic status and ongoing islet autoimmunity in high-risk individuals, since several miRNAs were associated to glucose homeostasis and autoantibody titers. High-risk individuals progressing to clinical disease after the sampling could not be clearly distinguished from non-progressors, while miRNA expression in the type 1 diabetes group deviated significantly from high-risk individuals and healthy controls, perhaps explained by major metabolic disturbances around the time of diagnosis."
https://openalex.org/W2786180579,"Lentil, generally known as poor man’s’ meat due to its high protein value is also a good source of dietary fiber, antioxidants and vitamins along with fast cooking characteristics. It could be used globally as a staple food crop to eradicate hidden hunger, if this nutritionally rich crop is further enriched with essential minerals. This requires identification of essential mineral rich germplasm. So, in the present study, a core set of 96 wild accessions extracted from 405 global wild annual collections comprising different species was analyzed to determine its bio-fortification potential. Impressive variation (mg/100 g) was observed for different minerals including Na (30–318), K (138.29–1578), P (37.50–593.75), Ca (4.74–188.75), Mg (15–159), Fe (2.82–14.12), Zn (1.29–12.62), Cu (0.5–7.12), Mn (1.22–9.99), Mo (1.02–11.89), Ni (0.16–3.49), Pb (0.01–0.58), Cd (0–0.03), Co (0–0.63) and As (0–0.02). Hierarchical clustering revealed high intra- and inter-specific variability. Further, correlation study showed positive significant association among minerals and between minerals including agro-morphological traits. Accessions representation from Turkey and Syria had maximum variability for different minerals. Diversity analysis exhibited wide geographical variations across gene-pool in core set. Potential use of the identified trait-specific genetic resources could be initial genetic material, for genetic base broadening and biofortification of cultivated lentil."
https://openalex.org/W2788606595,"Stem cells derived from placental tissues are an attractive source of cells for regenerative medicine. Amniotic epithelial cells isolated from human amnion (hAECs) have desirable and competitive characteristics that make them stand out between other stem cells. They have the ability to differentiate toward all three germ layers, they are not tumorigenic and they have immunosuppressive properties. Although liver transplantation is the best way to treat acute and chronic hepatic failure patients, there are several obstacles. Recently, stem cells have been spotlighted as alternative source of hepatocytes because of their potential for hepatogenic differentiation. In this work, we aimed to study the proliferation and survival of the hAECs during their hepatic differentiation. We have also analyzed the changes in pluripotency and hepatic markers. We differentiated amniotic cells applying a specific hepatic differentiation (HD) protocol. We determined by qRT-PCR that hAECs express significant levels of SOX-2, OCT-4 and NANOG during at least 15 days in culture and these pluripotent markers diminish during HD. SSEA-4 expression was reduced during HD, measured by immunofluorescence. Morphological characteristics became more similar to hepatic ones in differentiated cells and representative hepatic markers significantly augmented their expression, measured by qRT-PCR and Western blot. Cells achieved a differentiation efficiency of 75%. We observed that HD induced proliferation and promoted survival of hAECs, during 30 days in culture, evaluated by 3H-thymidine incorporation and MTT assay. HD also promoted changes in hAECs cell cycle. Cyclin D1 expression increased, while p21 and p53 levels were reduced. Immunofluorescence analysis showed that Ki-67 expression was upregulated during HD. Finally, ERK 1/2 phosphorylation, which is intimately linked to proliferation and cell survival, augmented during all HD process and the inhibition of this signaling pathway affected not only proliferation but also differentiation. Our results suggest that HD promotes proliferation and survival of hAECs, providing important evidence about the mechanisms governing their hepatic differentiation. We bring new knowledge concerning some of the optimal transplantation conditions for these hepatic like cells."
https://openalex.org/W2788360595,"Vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (vEDS) is a dominantly inherited connective tissue disorder caused by mutations in the COL3A1 gene that encodes type III collagen (COLLIII), which is the major expressed collagen in blood vessels and hollow organs. The majority of disease-causing variants in COL3A1 are glycine substitutions and in-frame splice mutations in the triple helix domain that through a dominant negative effect are associated with the severe clinical spectrum potentially lethal of vEDS, characterized by fragility of soft connective tissues with arterial and organ ruptures. To shed lights into molecular mechanisms underlying vEDS, we performed gene expression profiling in cultured skin fibroblasts from three patients with different structural COL3A1 mutations. Transcriptome analysis revealed significant changes in the expression levels of several genes involved in maintenance of cell redox and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) homeostasis, COLLs folding and extracellular matrix (ECM) organization, formation of the proteasome complex, and cell cycle regulation. Protein analyses showed that aberrant COLLIII expression is associated with the disassembly of many structural ECM constituents, such as fibrillins, EMILINs, and elastin, as well as with the reduction of the proteoglycans perlecan, decorin, and versican, all playing an important role in the vascular system. Furthermore, the altered distribution of the ER marker protein disulfide isomerase PDI and the strong reduction of the COLLs-modifying enzyme FKBP22 are consistent with the disturbance of ER-related homeostasis and COLLs biosynthesis and post-translational modifications, indicated by microarray analysis. Our findings add new insights into the pathophysiology of this severe vascular disorder, since they provide a picture of the gene expression changes in vEDS skin fibroblasts and highlight that dominant negative mutations in COL3A1 also affect post-translational modifications and deposition into the ECM of several structural proteins crucial to the integrity of soft connective tissues."
https://openalex.org/W2784379333,"Background and purpose Rapidly progressive dementia (RPD) is an emergency in cognitive neurology, defined as cognitive impairment affecting the daily living activities developed over less than 1 year. This study investigated the profile of patients with rapidly progressive dementia at first presentation. Methods Retrospective case analysis was done in 187 patients with rapidly progressive dementia who presented to the Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh, India from January 2008 to August 2016. Patients were divided into three groups: (1) Reversible (treatable) secondary dementia group, (2) Prion dementia group (sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease), (3) Non-prion Neurodegenerative and vascular dementias (primary neurodegenerative and vascular dementia). Cases presenting with delirium secondary to metabolic, drug induced or septic causes and those with signs of meningitis were excluded. Results Secondary reversible causes formed the most common cause for RPD with immune mediated encephalitides, neoplastic and infectious disorders as the leading causes. The patients in this series had an younger onset of RPD. Infections presenting with RPD accounted for the most common cause in our series (39%) with SSPE (41%) as the leading cause followed by neurosyphilis (17.9%) and progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (15.3%). Immune mediated dementias formed the second most common (18.1%) etiologic cause for RPD. The neurodegenerative dementias were third common cause for RPD in our series. Neoplastic disorders and immune mediated presented early (< 6 months) while neurodegenerative disorders presented later (> 6 months). Conclusions Rapidly progressive dementia is an emergency in cognitive neurology with potentially treatable or reversible causes that should be sought for diligently."
https://openalex.org/W2785183424,"Methadone maintenance treatment (MMT) services may reduce the risk of HIV transmission if patients completely adhere to the treatment. Identifying adherence patterns and potential related factors is vital for the sustainability of MMT program in Vietnam. This study examined social and structural factors associated with adherence to MMT among patients in different service delivery models.A total of 510 patients at three MMT clinics in Hanoi were interviewed. Measures of self-reported adherence included the number of missed doses in the past 7 days and the level of adherence in the past 30 days using a visual analog scale (VAS) scoring from 0 (non-adherence) to 100 (perfect adherence). Multivariate regressions were employed to identify factors associated with non-adherence to MMT.A total of 17.7% of participants reported incomplete MMT adherence in the last 30 days and 8.3% reported missing a dose in the last seven days, respectively. Living with HIV/AIDS, poor self-care and usual activities, and disclosure of health issues to spouses or intimate partners were associated with non-adherence. Those patients with pain or depression were more likely to report better adherence. Disclosing health status to spouse/partner increased the risk of incomplete adherence, while disclosing to friends reduced the number of missed dose in the last seven days. Patients attending clinics with comprehensive services had a lower VAS score of adherence compared to those enrolling in clinics with only MMT and general health care.Sustaining the compliance of patients to MMT is principal in the rapid expansion of this service in Vietnam. It is necessary to address the complexity of health care demands of drug users, their difficulties to be rehabilitated into workforce and society, and the stigmatization to maximize the outcomes of MMT program."
https://openalex.org/W2793250092,"Background ‘Healthy’ aging drives structural and functional changes in the heart including maladaptive electrical remodeling, fibrosis and inflammation, which lower the threshold for cardiovascular diseases such as heart failure (HF) and atrial fibrillation (AF). Despite mixed results in recent clinical trials, Relaxin-therapy for 2-days could reduce mortality by 37% at 180-days post-treatment, in patients with acute decompensated HF. Relaxin’s short life-span (hours) but long-lasting protective actions led us to test the hypothesis that relaxin acts at a genomic level to reverse maladaptive remodeling in aging and HF. Methods and results Young (9-month) and aged (24-month), male and female F-344/Brown Norway rats were treated with relaxin (0.4 mg/kg/day) for 2-weeks delivered by subcutaneous osmotic mini-pumps or with sodium acetate (controls). The genomic effects of aging and relaxin were evaluated by extracting RNA from the left ventricles and analyzing genomic changes by RNA-sequencing, Ingenuity Pathway Analysis, MetaCore and tissue immunohistochemistry. We found that aging promotes a native inflammatory response with distinct sex-differences and relaxin suppresses transcription of multiple genes and signaling pathways associated with inflammation and HF in both genders. In addition, aging significantly increased: macrophage infiltration and atrial natriuretic peptide levels in female ventricles, and activation of the complement cascade, whereas relaxin reversed these age-related effects. Conclusion These data support the hypothesis that relaxin alters gene transcription and suppresses inflammatory pathways and genes associated with HF and aging. Relaxin’s suppression of inflammation and fibrosis supports its potential as a therapy for cardiovascular and inflammation-related diseases, such as HF, AF and diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W2783499830,"The chelating and antimicrobial capacity of a novel modification of 17% EDTA with silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) (EDTA-AgNPs) was evaluated in-vitro for root canal treatment (RCT). The EDTA-AgNPs solution was characterized by UV-Vis spectroscopy, ζ-potential and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM). Antimicrobial capacity was evaluated against Candida albicans and Staphylococcus aureus in planktonic and biofilm cells by broth macrodilution (24 h) and XTT assays, (1, 10 and 30 min) respectively. The chelating capacity of EDTA-AgNPs was assessed indirectly (smear layer removal) and directly (demineralizing effect) in bovine dentin at two silver concentrations, 16 and 512 μg/ml at 1 and 10 minutes of exposure time. Smear layer removal was evaluated by atomic force microscopy (AFM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The demineralizing effect was determined by atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS), microhardness test (MH) and X-ray diffractometer (XRD). Synthesized AgNPs were quasi-spherical in shape with an average size of 13.09 ± 8.05 nm. 17% EDTA-AgNPs was effective to inhibit C. albicans and S. aureus in planktonic and biofilm cultures. The smear layer removal and demineralizing effect were similar between 17% EDTA-AgNPs and 17% EDTA treatments. The 17% EDTA-AgNPs solution proved to be an effective antimicrobial agent, and has a similar chelating capacity to 17% EDTA alone. These in-vitro studies strongly suggest that EDTA-AgNPs could be used for effective smear layer removal, having an antimicrobial effect at the same time during RCT."
https://openalex.org/W2786490121,"In order to improve animal welfare it is recommended that dairy farmers move calving cows from the herd to individual pens when calving is imminent. However, the practicality of moving cows has proven a challenge and may lead to disturbance of the cows rather than easing the process of calving. One solution may be to allow the cow to seek isolation prior to calving. This study examined whether pre-parturient dairy cows will isolate in an individual calving pen placed in a group calving setting and whether a closing gate in this individual calving pen will cause more cows to isolate prior to calving. Danish Holstein cows (n = 66) were housed in groups of six in a group pen with access to six individual calving pens connected to the group area. Cows were trained to use one of two isolation opportunities i.e. individual calving pens with functional closing gates (n = 35) allowing only one cow access at a time, or individual calving pens with permanently open gates allowing free cow traffic between group area and individual pen (n = 31). The response variables were calving site, calving behaviour and social behaviour. Unexpectedly, a functional gate did not facilitate isolation seeking, perhaps because the cows were not able to combine a learnt response with the motivation to isolate. Dominant cows had the highest chance of calving in an individual calving pen. If an alien calf was present in the group pen or any of the individual pens, cows were less likely to calve in an individual calving pen. Future studies should allow cows easy access to an individual calving pen and explore what motivates pre-parturient cows to seek isolation in order to facilitate voluntary use of individual calving pens."
https://openalex.org/W2782914635,"Background Vault is the largest nonicosahedral cytosolic nucleoprotein particle, which is widely involved in induction of chemoresistance and lead to failure in long-term chemotherapy. Vault contains three different major vault proteins (MVPs) and four vault RNAs paralogues (vtRNAs, vtRNA1-1, vtRNA1-2, vtRNA1-3 and vtRNA2-1). Disruption of the MVPs do not induce hypersensitivity while expression of vtRNAs contributes to cells’ drug resistance, indicates that vtRNAs, but not MVPs play an important role in causing drug resistance. Polypyrimidine tract binding protein associated splicing factor (PSF) contributes to cell sensitivity to chemotherapy by its transcriptional activity, promotes us to figure out its potential association with vtRNAs. Methods We investigate the interaction between PSF and vtRNAs by electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) and RNA-immunoprecipitation (IP), and showed the binding between PSF and vtRNAs. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) was performed to detect the effects of vtRNAs on the interaction of PSF with GAGE6 promoter. The role of vtRNAs on chemoresistance in MCF-7 was detected by CCK-8 and EdU staining. The independent role of vtRNAs with MVP is detected by MVP or vtRNAs knockdown. Results The complex with vtRNA1-1 releases PSF, allowing transcription of GAGE6 to proceed. Then we showed that induction of GAGE6 caused drug resistance by promoting cell proliferation and colony formation in soft agar. Ectopic expression of shRNA targets to vtRNA1-1 further confirmed the role of vtRNA1-1 in regulating PSF transcriptional activity independent with the expression of MVP. By vtRNA1-1 or MVP knockdown, it is revealed that vtRNA1-1 caused chemoresistance independent of MVP. Furthermore, knockdown of GAGE6 does not cause drug resistance, indicates the GAGE6 is directly involved in cell proliferation, but not the drug resistance. Conclusion These results suggest that vtRNAs regulates cell proliferation, drug resistance, and possibly other physiological processes of humans, by complex formation with PSF."
https://openalex.org/W2792663350,"Vitellaria paradoxa (Gaertn C. F.), or shea tree, remains one of the most valuable trees for farmers in the Atacora district of northern Benin, where rural communities depend on shea products for both food and income. To optimize productivity and management of shea agroforestry systems, or ""parklands,"" accurate and up-to-date data are needed. For this purpose, we monitored120 fruiting shea trees for two years under three land-use scenarios and different soil groups in Atacora, coupled with a farm household survey to elicit information on decision making and management practices. To examine the local pattern of shea tree productivity and relationships between morphological factors and yields, we used a randomized branch sampling method and applied a regression analysis to build a shea yield model based on dendrometric, soil and land-use variables. We also compared potential shea yields based on farm household socio-economic characteristics and management practices derived from the survey data. Soil and land-use variables were the most important determinants of shea fruit yield. In terms of land use, shea trees growing on farmland plots exhibited the highest yields (i.e., fruit quantity and mass) while trees growing on Lixisols performed better than those of the other soil group. Contrary to our expectations, dendrometric parameters had weak relationships with fruit yield regardless of land-use and soil group. There is an inter-annual variability in fruit yield in both soil groups and land-use type. In addition to observed inter-annual yield variability, there was a high degree of variability in production among individual shea trees. Furthermore, household socioeconomic characteristics such as road accessibility, landholding size, and gross annual income influence shea fruit yield. The use of fallow areas is an important land management practice in the study area that influences both conservation and shea yield."
https://openalex.org/W2788182882,"Synthetic oxytocin (sOT) is widely used during labor, yet little is known about its effects on fetal brain development despite evidence that it reaches the fetal circulation. Here, we tested the hypothesis that sOT would affect early neurodevelopment by investigating its effects on neural progenitor cells (NPC) from embryonic day 14 rat pups. NPCs expressed the oxytocin receptor (OXTR), which was downregulated by 45% upon prolonged treatment with sOT. Next, we examined the effects of sOT on NPC death, apoptosis, proliferation, and differentiation using antibodies to NeuN (neurons), Olig2 (oligodendrocytes), and GFAP (astrocytes). Treated NPCs were analysed with unbiased high-throughput immunocytochemistry. Neither 6 nor 24 h exposure to 100 pM or 100 nM sOT had an effect on viability as assessed by PI or CC-3 immunocytochemistry. Similarly, sOT had negligible effect on NPC proliferation, except that the overall rate of NPC proliferation was higher in the 24 h compared to the 6 h group regardless of sOT exposure. The most significant finding was that sOT exposure caused NPCs to select a predominantly neuronal lineage, along with a concomitant decrease in glial cells. Collectively, our data suggest that perinatal exposure to sOT can have neurodevelopmental consequences for the fetus, and support the need for in vivo anatomical and behavioral studies in offspring exposed to sOT in utero."
https://openalex.org/W2789111610,"To evaluate the association of salt consumption with blood pressure in Viet Nam, a developing country with a high level of salt consumption.Analysis of a nationally representative sample of Vietnamese adults 25-65 years of age who were surveyed using the World Health Organization STEPwise approach to Surveillance protocol. Participants who reported acute illness, pregnancy, or current use of antihypertensive medications were excluded. Daily salt consumption was estimated from fasting mid-morning spot urine samples. Associations of salt consumption with systolic blood pressure and prevalent hypertension were assessed using adjusted linear and generalized linear models. Interaction terms were tested to assess differences by age, smoking, alcohol consumption, and rural/urban status.The analysis included 2,333 participants (mean age: 37 years, 46% male, 33% urban). The average estimated salt consumption was 10g/day. No associations of salt consumption with blood pressure or prevalent hypertension were observed at a national scale in men or women. The associations did not differ in subgroups defined by age, smoking, or alcohol consumption; however, associations differed between urban and rural participants (p-value for interaction of urban/rural status with salt consumption, p = 0.02), suggesting that higher salt consumption may be associated with higher systolic blood pressure in urban residents but lower systolic blood pressure in rural residents.Although there was no evidence of an association at a national level, associations of salt consumption with blood pressure differed between urban and rural residents in Viet Nam. The reasons for this differential association are not clear, and given the large rate of rural to urban migration experienced in Viet Nam, this topic warrants further investigation."
https://openalex.org/W2783053849,"Background Lung function is complex trait with both genetic and environmental factors contributing to variation. It is unknown how geographic factors such as climate affect population respiratory health. Objective To determine whether ambient air temperature is associated with lung function (FEV1) in the general population. Design/Setting Associations between spirometry data from two National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) periods representative of the U.S. non-institutionalized population and mean annual ambient temperature were assessed using survey-weighted multivariate regression. Participants/Measurements The NHANES III (1988–94) cohort included 14,088 individuals (55.6% female) and the NHANES 2007–12 cohort included 14,036 individuals (52.3% female), with mean ages of 37.4±23.4 and 34.4±21.8 years old and FEV1 percent predicted values of 99.8±15.8% and 99.2±14.5%, respectively. Results After adjustment for confounders, warmer ambient temperatures were associated with lower lung function in both cohorts (NHANES III p = 0.020; NHANES 2007–2012 p = 0.014). The effect was similar in both cohorts with a 0.71% and 0.59% predicted FEV1 decrease for every 10°F increase in mean temperature in the NHANES III and NHANES 2007–2012 cohorts, respectively. This corresponds to ~2 percent predicted difference in FEV1 between the warmest and coldest regions in the continental United States. Conclusions In the general U.S. population, residing in regions with warmer ambient air temperatures was associated with lower lung function with an effect size similar to that of traffic pollution. Rising temperatures associated with climate change could have effects on pulmonary function in the general population."
https://openalex.org/W2784047458,"The potential effects of adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cells (AT-MSCs) on the growth and invasion of canine tumours including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are not yet understood. Moreover in humans, the functional contribution of AT-MSCs to malignancies remains controversial. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of AT-MSCs on the proliferation and invasion of canine HCC cells in vitro. The effect of AT-MSCs on mRNA levels of factors related to HCC progression were also evaluated. Conditioned medium from AT-MSCs (AT-MSC-CM) significantly enhanced canine HCC cell proliferation and invasion. Moreover, mRNA expression levels of transforming growth factor-beta 1, epidermal growth factor A, hepatocyte growth factor, platelet-derived growth factor-beta, vascular endothelial growth factor, and insulin-like growth factor 2 were 2.3 ± 0.4, 2.0 ± 0.5, 5.7 ± 1.9, 1.7 ± 0.2, 2.1 ± 0.4, and 1.4 ± 0.3 times higher, respectively (P < 0.05). The mRNA expression level of MMP-2 also increased (to 4.0 ± 1.2 times control levels) in canine HCC cells co-cultured with AT-MSCs, but MMP-9 mRNA significantly decreased (to 0.5 ± 0.1 times control levels). These findings suggest that soluble factors from AT-MSCs promote the proliferation and invasion of canine HCC cells."
https://openalex.org/W2787491174,"In 2014, Egypt’s Demographic and Health Survey (EDHS) documented an increase in the total fertility rate (TFR) to 3.5, up from a low of 3.0 recorded by the 2008 EDHS. The increase has been anecdotally attributed to the social upheaval following Egypt’s January 2011 revolution, but little is known about when fertility first began to increase and among which sub-groups of women. Using birth histories from seven rounds of EDHS (1992–2014), this study reconstructed fertility rates for single years from 1990–2013 and examined patterns of childbearing in five-year birth cohorts of women. We found that the decline in fertility reversed in 2007, earlier than postulated, plateaued and then increased again in 2013. The increase in TFR coincided with a convergence of fertility rates across education levels, and there is evidence of a shift toward childbearing at younger ages among more educated women, which may be inflating period measures of fertility."
https://openalex.org/W2793596752,"Until recently, morpholino oligonucleotides have been widely employed in zebrafish as an acute and efficient loss-of-function assay. However, off-target effects and reproducibility issues when compared to stable knockout lines have compromised their further use. Here we employed an acute CRISPR/Cas approach using multiple single guide RNAs targeting simultaneously different positions in two exemplar genes (osgep or tprkb) to increase the likelihood of generating mutations on both alleles in the injected F0 generation and to achieve a similar effect as morpholinos but with the reproducibility of stable lines. This multi single guide RNA approach resulted in median likelihoods for at least one mutation on each allele of >99% and sgRNA specific insertion/deletion profiles as revealed by deep-sequencing. Immunoblot showed a significant reduction for Osgep and Tprkb proteins. For both genes, the acute multi-sgRNA knockout recapitulated the microcephaly phenotype and reduction in survival that we observed previously in stable knockout lines, though milder in the acute multi-sgRNA knockout. Finally, we quantify the degree of mutagenesis by deep sequencing, and provide a mathematical model to quantitate the chance for a biallelic loss-of-function mutation. Our findings can be generalized to acute and stable CRISPR/Cas targeting for any zebrafish gene of interest."
https://openalex.org/W2787231130,"Africanized honey bees (Apis mellifera) arrived in the western hemisphere in the 1950s and quickly spread north reaching California in the 1990s. These bees are highly defensive and somewhat more difficult to manage for commercial purposes than the European honey bees traditionally kept. The arrival of these bees and their potentially replacing European bees over much of the state is thus of great concern. After a 25 year period of little systematic sampling, a recent small scale study found Africanized honey bees in the Bay Area of California, far north of their last recorded distribution. The purpose of the present study was to expand this study by conducting more intensive sampling of bees from across northern California. We found Africanized honey bees as far north as Napa and Sacramento. We also found Africanized bees in all counties south of these counties. Africanized honey bees were particularly abundant in parts of the central valley and Monterey. This work suggests the northern spread of Africanized honey bees may not have stopped. They may still be moving north at a slow rate, although due to the long gaps in sampling it is currently impossible to tell for certain. Future work should routinely monitor the distribution of these bees to distinguish between these two possibilities."
https://openalex.org/W2786163370,"In an experimental mouse model we showed that ceramides play a role in the pathogenesis of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) and are a potential target for therapeutic intervention. We investigated whether ceramides are detectable in tracheal aspirates (TAs) of preterm infants and differ between infants with or without BPD.Infants born ≤ 32 weeks of gestational age in need of mechanical ventilation in the first week of life were included. TAs were obtained directly after intubation and at day 1, 3, 5, 7, and 14. Ceramide concentrations were measured by tandem mass spectrometry. At 36 weeks postmenstrual age BPD was defined as having had ≥ 28 days supplemental oxygen.122 infants were included, of which 14 died and 41 developed BPD. All infants showed an increase in ceramides after the first day of intubation. The ceramide profile differed significantly between preterm infants who did and did not develop BPD. However, the ceramide profile had no additional predictive value for BPD development over GA at birth, birth weight and total days of mechanical ventilation.Ceramides are measurable in TAs of preterm born infants and may be an early marker for BPD development."
https://openalex.org/W2791749653,"Asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients are required to inhale forcefully and deeply to receive medication when using a dry powder inhaler (DPI). There is a clinical need to objectively monitor the inhalation flow profile of DPIs in order to remotely monitor patient inhalation technique. Audio-based methods have been previously employed to accurately estimate flow parameters such as the peak inspiratory flow rate of inhalations, however, these methods required multiple calibration inhalation audio recordings. In this study, an audio-based method is presented that accurately estimates inhalation flow profile using only one calibration inhalation audio recording. Twenty healthy participants were asked to perform 15 inhalations through a placebo Ellipta™ DPI at a range of inspiratory flow rates. Inhalation flow signals were recorded using a pneumotachograph spirometer while inhalation audio signals were recorded simultaneously using the Inhaler Compliance Assessment device attached to the inhaler. The acoustic (amplitude) envelope was estimated from each inhalation audio signal. Using only one recording, linear and power law regression models were employed to determine which model best described the relationship between the inhalation acoustic envelope and flow signal. Each model was then employed to estimate the flow signals of the remaining 14 inhalation audio recordings. This process repeated until each of the 15 recordings were employed to calibrate single models while testing on the remaining 14 recordings. It was observed that power law models generated the highest average flow estimation accuracy across all participants (90.89±0.9% for power law models and 76.63±2.38% for linear models). The method also generated sufficient accuracy in estimating inhalation parameters such as peak inspiratory flow rate and inspiratory capacity within the presence of noise. Estimating inhaler inhalation flow profiles using audio based methods may be clinically beneficial for inhaler technique training and the remote monitoring of patient adherence."
https://openalex.org/W2793466414,"The functionality of a protein depends on its correct folding, but newly synthesized proteins are susceptible to aberrant folding and aggregation. Heat shock proteins (HSPs) function as molecular chaperones that aid in protein folding and the degradation of misfolded proteins. Trinucleotide (CAG) repeat expansion in the Huntingtin gene (HTT) results in the expression of misfolded Huntingtin protein (Htt), which contributes to the development of Huntington's disease. We previously found that the degradation of mutated Htt with polyQ expansion (Htt103QP) depends on both ubiquitin proteasome system and autophagy. However, the role of heat shock proteins in the clearance of mutated Htt remains poorly understood. Here, we report that cytosolic Hsp70 (Ssa family), its nucleotide exchange factors (Sse1 and Fes1), and a Hsp40 co-chaperone (Ydj1) are required for inclusion body formation of Htt103QP proteins and their clearance via autophagy. Extended induction of Htt103QP-GFP leads to the formation of a single inclusion body in wild-type yeast cells, but mutant cells lacking these HSPs exhibit increased number of Htt103QP aggregates. Most notably, we detected more aggregated forms of Htt103QP in sse1Δ mutant cells using an agarose gel assay. Increased protein aggregates are also observed in these HSP mutants even in the absence Htt103QP overexpression. Importantly, these HSPs are required for autophagy-mediated Htt103QP clearance, but are less critical for proteasome-dependent degradation. These findings suggest a chaperone network that facilitates inclusion body formation of misfolded proteins and the subsequent autophagic clearance."
https://openalex.org/W2786020111,"This paper assesses inequalities in access to reproductive and maternal health services among females affected by forced displacement and sexual and gender-based violence in conflict settings in Colombia. This was accomplished through the following approaches: first, we assessed the gaps and gradients in three selected reproductive and maternal health care services. Second, we analyzed the patterns of inequalities in reproductive and maternal health care services and changes over time. And finally, we identified challenges and strategies for reaching girls and women who are the hardest to reach in conflict settings, in order to accelerate progress towards universal health coverage and to contribute to meeting the Sustainable Development Goals of good health and well-being and gender equality by 2030.Three types of data were required: data about health outcomes (relating to rates of females affected by conflict), information about reproductive and maternal health care services to provide a social dimension to unmask inequalities (unmet needs in family planning, antenatal care and skilled births attendance); and data on the female population. Data sources used include the National Information System for Social Protection, the National Registry of Victims, the National Administrative Department of Statistics, and Demographic Health Survey at three specific time points: 2005, 2010 and 2015. We estimated the slope index of inequality to express absolute inequality (gaps) and the concentration index to expresses relative inequality (gradients), and to understand whether inequality was eliminated over time.Our findings show that even though absolute health care service-related inequalities dropped over time, relative inequalities worsened or remain unchanged. All summary measures still indicated the existence of inequalities as well as common patterns. Our findings suggest that there is a pattern of marginal exclusion and incremental patterns of inequality in the reproductive and maternal health care service provided to female affected by armed conflict.Overall, the effects of conflict continue to threaten reproductive and maternal health in Colombia, impeding progress towards the realization of universal health care (UHC) and reinforcing already-existing inequities. Key messages and steps forward include the need to understand the two distinct patterns of inequalities identified in this study in order to prompt improved general policy responses. Addressing unmet needs in reproductive and maternal health requires supporting gender equality and prioritizing the girls and women in regions with the highest rates of victims of armed conflict, with the objective of leaving no girl or woman behind. This analysis represents the first attempt to analyze coverage-related inequality in reproductive and maternal health care services for female affected by armed conflict in Colombia. As the World Health Organization and global health systems leaders call for more inclusive engagement, this approach may serve as the key to shaping people-centred health systems. In this particular case, health care facilities must be located in close proximity to girls and women in conflict and post-conflict settings in order to deliver essential reproductive and maternal health care services. Finally, reducing inequalities in opportunities would not only promote equity, but also drive sustainable development."
https://openalex.org/W2788036639,"Increased cognitive distortions (i.e. biased processing of chance, probability and skill) are a key psychopathological process in disordered gambling. The present study investigated state and trait aspects of cognitive distortions in 22 individuals with Internet Gaming Disorder (IGD) and 22 healthy controls. Participants completed the Gambling Related Cognitions Scale as a trait measure of cognitive distortions, and played a slot machine task delivering wins, near-misses and full-misses. Ratings of pleasure (""liking"") and motivation to play (""wanting"") were taken following the different outcomes, and gambling persistence was measured after a mandatory phase. IGD was associated with elevated trait cognitive distortions, in particular skill-oriented cognitions. On the slot machine task, the IGD group showed increased ""wanting"" ratings compared with control participants, while the two groups did not differ regarding their ""liking"" of the game. The IGD group displayed increased persistence on the slot machine task. Near-miss outcomes did not elicit stronger motivation to play compared to full-miss outcomes overall, and there was no group difference on this measure. However, a near-miss position effect was observed, such that near-misses stopping before the payline were rated as more motivating than near-misses that stopped after the payline, and this differentiation was attenuated in the IGD group, suggesting possible counterfactual thinking deficits in this group. These data provide preliminary evidence for increased incentive motivation and cognitive distortions in IGD, at least in the context of a chance-based gambling environment."
https://openalex.org/W2789087673,"Metastasis is responsible for the majority of cancer associated fatalities. Tumor cells leaving the primary tumor and entering the blood flow immediately interact with platelets. Activated platelets contribute in different ways to cancer cell survival and proliferation, e.g. in formation of the early metastatic niche by release of different growth factors and chemokines. Here we show that a direct interaction between platelets and MV3 melanoma or MCF7 breast cancer cells induces platelet activation and a VEGF release in citrated plasma that cannot be further elevated by the coagulation cascade and generated thrombin. In contrast, the release of platelet-derived chemokines CXCL5 and CXCL7 depends on both, a thrombin-mediated platelet activation and a direct interaction between tumor cells and platelets. Preincubation of platelets with therapeutic concentrations of unfractionated heparin reduces the tumor cell initiated VEGF release from platelets. In contrast, tumor cell induced CXCL5 and CXCL7 release from platelets was not impacted by heparin pretreatment in citrated plasma. In defibrinated, recalcified plasma, on the contrary, heparin is able to reduce CXCL5 and CXCL7 release from platelets by thrombin inhibition. Our data indicate that different chemokines and growth factors in diverse platelet granules are released in tightly regulated processes by various trigger mechanisms. We show for the first time that heparin is able to reduce the mediator release induced by different tumor cells both in a contact and coagulation dependent manner."
https://openalex.org/W2789620645,"An abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a dilatation of the abdominal aorta leading to serious complications and mostly to death. AAA development is associated with an accumulation of inflammatory cells in the aorta including NKT cells. An important factor in promoting the recruitment of these inflammatory cells into tissues and thereby contributing to the development of AAA is angiotensin II (Ang II). We demonstrate that a deficiency in CD1d dependent NKT cells under hyperlipidemic conditions (LDLr-/-CD1d-/- mice) results in a strong decline in the severity of angiotensin II induced aneurysm formation when compared with LDLr-/- mice. In addition, we show that Ang II amplifies the activation of NKT cells both in vivo and in vitro. We also provide evidence that type I NKT cells contribute to AAA development by inducing the expression of matrix degrading enzymes in vSMCs and macrophages, and by cytokine dependently decreasing vSMC viability. Altogether, these data prove that CD1d-dependent NKT cells contribute to AAA development in the Ang II-mediated aneurysm model by enhancing aortic degradation, establishing that therapeutic applications which target NKT cells can be a successful way to prevent AAA development."
https://openalex.org/W2791231400,"The European Higher Education Area (EHEA) is an opportunity to redesign medical education. Academic training is now focused on acquiring not only knowledge, but also those competencies critical to face complex professional scenarios. Together with re-evaluating traditional teaching methods, EHEA has forced a technological shift in the way we teach. By critically assessing the impact of novel teaching methodologies, we can better define biomedical education demands. Here, we address this question on a sample of medical students instructed in basic subjects along the first two academic courses. Two hundred and one medical students participated in the study (n = 128 first year, n = 73 second year). Quantitative (conventional survey statistics) and qualitative (open coding) approaches were combined to analyze data from surveys, confidential questionnaires, semi-structured interviews and open discussion. First year medical students rated more positively the use of participatory methodologies than second year students. A major drawback is detected in the perceived workload. Active teaching methodologies show a strong reliance on their time of implementation for medical students, a key aspect to be considered in the design of integrative participatory curricula along the first academic courses."
https://openalex.org/W2792214068,"Uganda is conducting a second mass LLIN distribution campaign and Katakwi district recently received LLINs as part of this activity. This study was conducted to measure the success of the campaign in this setting, an area of high transmission, with the objectives to estimate LLIN ownership, access and use pre and post campaign implementation.Two identical cross sectional surveys, based on the Malaria Indicator Survey methodology, were conducted in three sub-counties in this district (Kapujan, Magoro and Toroma), six months apart, one before and another after the mass distribution campaign. Data on three main LLIN indicators including; household LLIN ownership, population with access to an LLIN and use were collected using a household and a women's questionnaire identical to the Malaria Indicator Survey.A total of 601 and 607 households were randomly selected in survey one and two respectively. At baseline, 60.57% (56.53-64.50) of households owned at least one net for every two persons who stayed in the household the night before the survey which significantly increased to 70.35% (66.54-73.96) after the campaign (p = 0.001). Similarly, the percentage of the household population with access to an LLIN significantly increased from 84.76% (82.99-86.52) to 91.57% (90.33-92.81), p = 0.001 and the percentage of household population that slept under an LLIN the night before the survey also significantly increased from 56.85% (55.06-58.82) to 81.72% (76.75-83.21), p = 0.001.The LLIN mass campaign successfully achieved the national target of over eighty-five percent of the population with access to an LLIN in this setting, however, universal household coverage and use were fourteen and three percent points less than the national target respectively. This is useful for malaria programs to consider during the planning of future campaigns by tailoring efforts around deficient areas like mechanisms to increase universal coverage and behavior change communication."
https://openalex.org/W2789929539,"Background The use of centrifugation-based approaches for processing donated blood into components is routine in the industrialized world, as disparate storage conditions require the rapid separation of ‘whole blood’ into distinct red blood cell (RBC), platelet, and plasma products. However, the logistical complications and potential cellular damage associated with centrifugation/apheresis manufacturing of blood products are well documented. The objective of this study was to evaluate a proof-of-concept system for whole blood processing, which does not employ electromechanical parts, is easily portable, and can be operated immediately after donation with minimal human labor. Methods and findings In a split-unit study (n = 6), full (~500mL) units of freshly-donated whole blood were divided, with one half processed by conventional centrifugation techniques and the other with the new blood separation system. Each of these processes took 2–3 hours to complete and were performed in parallel. Blood products generated by the two approaches were compared using an extensive panel of cellular and plasma quality metrics. Comparison of nearly all RBC parameters showed no significant differences between the two approaches, although the portable system generated RBC units with a slight but statistically significant improvement in 2,3-diphosphoglyceric acid concentration (p < 0.05). More notably, several markers of platelet damage were significantly and meaningfully higher in products generated with conventional centrifugation: the increase in platelet activation (assessed via P-selectin expression in platelets before and after blood processing) was nearly 4-fold higher for platelet units produced via centrifugation, and the release of pro-inflammatory mediators (soluble CD40-ligand, thromboxane B2) was significantly higher for centrifuged platelets as well (p < 0.01). Conclusion This study demonstrated that a simple, passive system for separating donated blood into components may be a viable alternative to centrifugation—particularly for applications in remote or resource-limited settings, or for patients requiring highly functional platelet product."
https://openalex.org/W2785249732,"Nanoparticles affect the immune system as they may interact directly with immune cells and activate them. However, it is possible that nanoparticles also interact with released cytokines and immunologically active enzymes. To test this hypothesis, the activity of myeloperoxidase released from activated neutrophils was measured in the presence of nanoparticles with different chemistry and size. In high concentrations of nanoparticles, myeloperoxidase activity is decreased whereas in low concentrations of nanoparticles the activity is increased. The effect of the nanoparticles on myeloperoxidase is dependent on the total protein concentration as low concentrations of bovine serum albumin together with nanoparticles further increase the myeloperoxidase activity. The results herein show that nanoparticles affect the immune response not only at the cellular level but also on released immune effectors. In particular, they show that the nanoparticle effect on myeloperoxidase activity in the neutrophil degranulation environment is the result of an intricate interplay between the enzyme and protein concentrations in the environment and the available surface area on the nanoparticle."
https://openalex.org/W2785386935,"Localization microscopy has shown to be capable of systematic investigations on the arrangement and counting of cellular uptake of gold nanoparticles (GNP) with nanometer resolution. In this article, we show that the application of specially modified RNA targeting gold nanoparticles (“SmartFlares”) can result in ring like shaped GNP arrangements around the cell nucleus. Transmission electron microscopy revealed GNP accumulation in vicinity to the intracellular membrane structures including them of the endoplasmatic reticulum. A quantification of the radio therapeutic dose enhancement as a proof of principle was conducted with γH2AX foci analysis: The application of both—SmartFlares and unmodified GNPs—lead to a significant dose enhancement with a factor of up to 1.2 times the dose deposition compared to non-treated breast cancer cells. This enhancement effect was even more pronounced for SmartFlares. Furthermore, it was shown that a magnetic field of 1 Tesla simultaneously applied during irradiation has no detectable influence on neither the structure nor the dose enhancement dealt by gold nanoparticles."
https://openalex.org/W2785954945,"Background We previously showed that increased asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) biliary excretion occurs during hepatic ischemia/reperfusion (I/R), prompting us to study the effects of the farnesoid X receptor (FXR) agonist obeticholic acid (OCA) on bile, serum and tissue levels of ADMA after I/R. Material and methods Male Wistar rats were orally administered 10mg/kg/day of OCA or vehicle for 5 days and were subjected to 60 min partial hepatic ischemia or sham-operated. After a 60 min reperfusion, serum, tissue and bile ADMA levels, liver mRNA and protein expression of ADMA transporters (CAT-1, CAT-2A, CAT-2B, OCT-1, MATE-1), and enzymes involved in ADMA synthesis (protein-arginine-N-methyltransferase-1, PRMT-1) and metabolism (dimethylarginine-dimethylaminohydrolase-1, DDAH-1) were measured. Results OCA administration induced a further increase in biliary ADMA levels both in sham and I/R groups, with no significant changes in hepatic ADMA content. A reduction in CAT-1, CAT-2A or CAT-2B transcripts was found in OCA-treated sham-operated rats compared with vehicle. Conversely, OCA administration did not change CAT-1, CAT-2A or CAT-2B expression, already reduced by I/R. However, a marked decrease in OCT-1 and increase in MATE-1 expression was observed. A similar trend occurred with protein expression. Conclusion The reduced mRNA expression of hepatic CAT transporters suggests that the increase in serum ADMA levels is probably due to decreased liver uptake of ADMA from the systemic circulation. Conversely, the mechanism involved in further increasing biliary ADMA levels in sham and I/R groups treated with OCA appears to be MATE-1-dependent."

We sought to develop and validate a population risk tool for obesity to inform prevention efforts.We developed the Obesity Population Risk Tool (OPoRT) using the longitudinal National Population Health Survey and sex-specific Generalized Estimating Equations to predict the 10-year risk of obesity among adults 18 and older. The model was validated using a bootstrap approach accounting for the survey design. Model performance was measured by the Brier statistic, discrimination was measured by the C-statistic, and calibration was assessed using the Hosmer-Lemeshow Goodness of Fit Chi Square (HL χ2).Predictive factors included baseline body mass index, age, time and their interactions, smoking status, living arrangements, education, alcohol consumption, physical activity, and ethnicity. OPoRT showed good performance for males and females (Brier 0.118 and 0.095, respectively), excellent discrimination (C statistic ≥ 0.89) and achieved calibration (HL χ2 <20).OPoRT is a valid and reliable algorithm that can be applied to routinely collected survey data to estimate the risk of obesity and identify groups at increased risk of obesity. These results can guide prevention efforts aimed at reducing the population burden of obesity."
https://openalex.org/W2792948296,"Members of the chloride channel regulators, calcium-activated (CLCA) family, have been implicated in diverse biomedical conditions, including chronic inflammatory airway diseases such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and cystic fibrosis, the activation of macrophages, and the growth and metastatic spread of tumor cells. Several observations, however, could not be repeated across species boundaries and increasing evidence suggests that select CLCA genes are particularly prone to dynamic species-specific evolvements. Here, we systematically characterized structural and expressional differences of the CLCA3 gene across mammalian species, revealing a spectrum of gene duplications, e.g., in mice and cows, and of gene silencing via diverse chromosomal modifications in pigs and many primates, including humans. In contrast, expression of a canonical CLCA3 protein from a single functional gene seems to be evolutionarily retained in carnivores, rabbits, guinea pigs, and horses. As an accepted asthma model, we chose the cat to establish the tissue and cellular expression pattern of the CLCA3 protein which was primarily found in mucin-producing cells of the respiratory tract and in stratified epithelia of the esophagus. Our results suggest that, among developmental differences in other CLCA genes, the CLCA3 gene possesses a particularly high dynamic evolutionary diversity with pivotal consequences for humans and other primates that seem to lack a CLCA3 protein. Our data also help to explain previous contradictory results on CLCA3 obtained from different species and warrant caution in extrapolating data from animal models in conditions where CLCA3 may be involved."
https://openalex.org/W2784199969,"The use of dried blood spot (DBS) specimens for HIV viral load (VL) monitoring is recommended to support the roll-out of routine VL monitoring in low and middle income countries (LMICs). To better understand the use of DBS for VL monitoring, we evaluated two DBS testing methods, Roche TaqMan® Free Virus Evolution protocol (DBS-FVE) and Roche TaqMan® SPEX protocol (DBS-SPEX)) in patients receiving ART at an HIV clinic in Hanoi, Vietnam. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) were calculated for each DBS testing method at the thresholds of 1000 and 5000 copies/ml compared to plasma VL. At a threshold of 1000 copies/ml, sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV of the DBS-SPEX method were 98.8% (95% CI: 93.3%-100%), 74.3% (95% CI: 70.8%-77.5%), 31.5% (95% CI: 25.8%-37.6%), and 99.8% (95% CI: 98.9%-100%), respectively. Increasing the VL threshold value to 5000 copies/ml improved specificity (97.9% CI: 96.6%-98.9%) and PPV (83.9% CI: 74.5%-90.9%). Using the DBS-FVE method, at the threshold of 1000 copies/ml and with a correction factor of +0.3 log copies/ml, sensitivity was 95.1% (87.8%-98.6%) and specificity was 98.8% (97.7%-99.5%). Sensitivity decreased at the threshold of 5000 copies/ml (65.8%, 95% CI: 54.3%-76.1%). With a correction factor of +0.7 log copies/ml, the sensitivity was 96.3% (89.6%-99.2%) and specificity was 98.2% (96.9%-99.1%) at the threshold of 1000 copies/ml. We found that the Roche DBS-FVE method, with a +0.7 log copies/ml correction factor, performed well with sensitivity and specificity greater than 96% at a VL threshold of 1000 copies/m. These findings add to the growing body of evidence supporting the use of DBS VL testing for ART monitoring. Future research should evaluate the association between VL results by DBS and clinical outcome measures such as HIV drug resistance, morbidity, and mortality."
https://openalex.org/W2788860676,"Bone marrow concentrate (BMC), which is enriched in mononuclear cells (MNCs) and platelets, has recently attracted the attention of clinicians as a new optional means for bone engineering. We previously reported that the osteoinductive effect of bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2) could be enhanced synergistically by co-transplantation of peripheral blood (PB)-derived platelet-rich plasma (PRP). This study aims to investigate whether BMC can effectively promote bone formation induced by low-dose BMP-2, thereby reducing the undesirable side-effects of BMP-2, compared to PRP. Human BMC was obtained from bone marrow aspirates using an automated blood separator. The BMC was then seeded onto β-TCP granules pre-adsorbed with a suboptimal-dose (minimum concentration to induce bone formation at 2 weeks in mice) of recombinant human (rh) BMP-2. These specimens were transplanted subcutaneously to the dorsal skin of immunodeficient-mice and the induction of ectopic bone formation was assessed 2 and 4 weeks post-transplantation. Transplantations of five other groups [PB, PRP, platelet-poor plasma (PPP), bone marrow aspirate (BM), and BM-PPP] were employed as experimental controls. Then, to clarify the effects on vertical bone augmentation, specimens from the six groups were transplanted for on-lay placement on the craniums of mice. The results indicated that BMC, which contained an approximately 2.5-fold increase in the number of MNCs compared to PRP, could accelerate ectopic bone formation until 2 weeks post-transplantation. On the cranium, the BMC group promoted bone augmentation with a suboptimal-dose of rhBMP-2 compared to other groups. Particularly in the BMC specimens harvested at 4 weeks, we observed newly formed bone surrounding the TCP granules at sites far from the calvarial bone. In conclusion, the addition of BMC could reduce the amount of rhBMP-2 by one-half via its synergistic effect on early-phase osteoinduction. We propose here that BMC transplantation facilitates the clinical use of rhBMP-2 as an alternative strategy for bone engineering."
https://openalex.org/W2790987645,"Multiple approaches are being utilized to develop therapeutics to treat HIV infection. One approach is designed to inhibit entry of HIV into host cells, with a target being the viral envelope glycoprotein, gp120. Polyanionic compounds have been shown to be effective in inhibiting HIV entry, with a mechanism involving electrostatic interactions with the V3 loop of gp120 being proposed. In this study, we applied computational methods to elucidate molecular interactions between the repeat unit of the precisely alternating polyanion, Poly(4,4′-stilbenedicarboxylate-alt–maleic acid) (DCSti-alt-MA) and the V3 loop of gp120 from strains of HIV against which these polyanions were previously tested (IIIb, BaL, 92UG037, JR-CSF) as well as two strains for which gp120 crystal structures are available (YU2, 2B4C). Homology modeling was used to create models of the gp120 proteins. Using monomers of the gp120 protein, we applied extensive molecular dynamics simulations to obtain dominant morphologies that represent a variety of open-closed states of the V3 loop to examine the interaction of 112 ligands of the repeating units of DCSti-alt-MA docked to the V3 loop and surrounding residues. Using the distance between the V1/V2 and V3 loops of gp120 as a metric, we revealed through MD simulations that gp120 from the lab-adapted strains (BaL and IIIb), which are more susceptible to inhibition by DCSti-alt-MA, clearly transitioned to the closed state in one replicate of each simulation set, whereas none of the replicates from the Tier II strains (92UG037 and JR-CSF) did so. Docking repeat unit microspecies to the gp120 protein before and after MD simulation enabled identification of residues that were key for binding. Notably, only a few residues were found to be important for docking both before and after MD simulation as a result of the conformational heterogeneity provided by the simulations. Consideration of the residues that were consistently involved in interactions with the ligand revealed the importance of both hydrophilic and hydrophobic moieties of the ligand for effective binding. The results also suggest that polymers of DCSti-alt-MA with repeating units of different configurations may have advantages for therapeutic efficacy."
https://openalex.org/W2784175304,"Burkholderia dolosa caused an outbreak in the cystic fibrosis clinic at Boston Children’s Hospital and was associated with high mortality in these patients. This species is part of a larger complex of opportunistic pathogens known as the Burkholderia cepacia complex (Bcc). Compared to other species in the Bcc, B. dolosa is highly transmissible; thus understanding its virulence mechanisms is important for preventing future outbreaks. The genome of one of the outbreak strains, AU0158, revealed a homolog of the lafA gene encoding a putative lateral flagellin, which, in other non-Bcc species, is used for movement on solid surfaces, attachment to host cells, or movement inside host cells. Here, we analyzed the conservation of the lafA gene and protein sequences, which are distinct from those of the polar flagella, and found lafA homologs to be present in numerous β-proteobacteria but notably absent from most other Bcc species. A lafA deletion mutant in B. dolosa showed a greater swimming motility than wild-type due to an increase in the number of polar flagella, but did not appear to contribute to biofilm formation, host cell invasion, or murine lung colonization or persistence over time. However, the lafA gene was important for cytokine production in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells, suggesting it may have a role in recognition by the human immune response."
https://openalex.org/W2787077053,"In vast contrast to the multitude of lineup studies that report on the link between decision time, confidence, and identification accuracy, only a few studies looked at these associations for showups, with results varying widely across studies. We therefore set out to test the individual and combined value of decision time and post-decision confidence for diagnosing the accuracy of positive showup decisions using confidence-accuracy characteristic curves and Bayesian analyses. Three-hundred-eighty-four participants viewed a stimulus event and were subsequently presented with two showups which could be target-present or target-absent. As expected, we found a negative decision time-accuracy and a positive post-decision confidence-accuracy correlation for showup selections. Confidence-accuracy characteristic curves demonstrated the expected additive effect of combining both postdictors. Likewise, Bayesian analyses, taking into account all possible target-presence base rate values showed that fast and confident identification decisions were more diagnostic than slow or less confident decisions, with the combination of both being most diagnostic for postdicting accurate and inaccurate decisions. The postdictive value of decision time and post-decision confidence was higher when the prior probability that the suspect is the perpetrator was high compared to when the prior probability that the suspect is the perpetrator was low. The frequent use of showups in practice emphasizes the importance of these findings for court proceedings. Overall, these findings support the idea that courts should have most trust in showup identifications that were made fast and confidently, and least in showup identifications that were made slowly and with low confidence."
https://openalex.org/W2785692457,"The PI3K/AKT signaling pathway plays a critical role in the maintenance of equilibrium between cell survival and apoptosis. The Pik3ca gene is mutated in a range of human cancers. It has been found to be oncogenic, and mutations lead to constitutive activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway. The expression patterns of PIK3CA proteins in the uterus of mice during early pregnancy indicate that it may play a role in the regulation of glandular epithelial cells, which is required to support uterine receptivity. To further investigate the role of Pik3ca in uterine function, Pik3ca was conditionally ablated only in the PGR-positive cells (Pgrcre/+Pik3caf/f; Pik3cad/d). A defect of uterine gland development and decidualization led to subfertility observed in Pik3cad/d mice. Pik3cad/d mice showed significantly decreased uterine weight compared to Pik3caf/f mice. Interestingly, a significant decrease of gland numbers were detected in Pik3cad/d mice compared to control mice. In addition, we found a decrease of Foxa2 expression, which is a known uterine gland marker in Pik3cad/d mice. Furthermore, the excessive proliferation of endometrial epithelial cells was observed in Pik3cad/d mice. Our studies suggest that Pik3ca has a critical role in uterine gland development and female fertility."
https://openalex.org/W2784333997,"The Nogo-B receptor (NgBR) is involved in oncogenic Ras signaling through directly binding to farnesylated Ras. It recruits farnesylated Ras to the non-lipid-raft membrane for interaction with downstream effectors. However, the cytosolic domain of NgBR itself is only partially folded. The lack of several conserved secondary structural elements makes this domain unlikely to form a complete farnesyl binding pocket. We find that inclusion of the extracellular and transmembrane domains that contain additional conserved residues to the cytosolic region results in a well folded protein with a similar size and shape to the E.coli cis-isoprenyl transferase (UPPs). Small Angle X-ray Scattering (SAXS) analysis reveals the radius of gyration (Rg) of our NgBR construct to be 18.2 Å with a maximum particle dimension (Dmax) of 61.0 Å. Ab initio shape modeling returns a globular molecular envelope with an estimated molecular weight of 23.0 kD closely correlated with the calculated molecular weight. Both Kratky plot and pair distribution function of NgBR scattering reveal a bell shaped peak which is characteristic of a single globularly folded protein. In addition, circular dichroism (CD) analysis reveals that our construct has the secondary structure contents similar to the UPPs. However, this result does not agree with the currently accepted topological orientation of NgBR which might partition this construct into three separate domains. This discrepancy suggests another possible NgBR topology and lends insight into a potential molecular basis of how NgBR facilitates farnesylated Ras recruitment."
https://openalex.org/W2788598848,"Eukaryotes, including the unicellular eukaryotes such as yeasts, employ multiple levels of gene regulation. Regulation of chromatin structure through chromatin compaction cascades, and influenced by transcriptional insulators, might play a role in the coordinated regulation of genes situated at adjacent loci and expressed as a co-regulated cluster. Subtelomeric gene silencing, which has previously been described in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, is an example of this phenomenon. Transcription from a common regulatory element located around a shared intergenic region is another factor that could coordinate the transcription of genes at adjacent loci. Additionally, the presence of DNA binding sites for the same transcription factor may coordinate expression of multiple genes. Yeasts such as the industrially important Kluyveromyces marxianus may also display these modes of regulation, but this has not been explored to date. An exploration was done using a complete genome and RNA-seq data from a previous study of the transcriptional response to glucose or xylose as the carbon source in a defined culture medium, and investigating whether the species displays clusters of co-localised differentially expressed genes. Regions of possible subtelomeric silencing were evident, but were non-responsive to the carbon sources tested here. Additionally, glucose or xylose responsive clusters were discovered far from telomeres which contained some of the most significantly differentially expressed genes, encoding enzymes involved in the utilisation of alternative carbon sources such as the industrially important inulinase gene INU1. These clusters contained putative binding sites for the carbon source responsive transcription factors Mig1 and Adr1. Additionally, we investigated the potential contribution of common intergenic regions in co-regulation. Some observations were also made in terms of the evolutionary conservation of these clusters among yeast species and the presence of potential transcriptional insulators at the periphery of these clusters."
https://openalex.org/W2793435726,"It is widely believed that couples look alike. Consistently, previous research reported higher facial similarity for couples than non-couples, and that facial similarity predicts marital satisfaction. However, it is unclear if facial similarity in couples shown in previous studies was solely driven by extrinsic features like hairstyle, glasses, etc. Also unclear is what attributes are perceived as similar from the faces of a couple. In three experiments, we showed that faces were considered more similar in couples than non-couples even without extrinsic features. Personality and age perceived from faces were also more similar in couples. Importantly, by matching pairs of faces according to their perceived personality, we found that a higher similarity in the perceived personality of a face pair led to higher facial similarity and couple likelihood ratings. These findings suggest that, instead of a result of pure physical analyses, facial similarity in couples is partly based on active social cognitive judgments on perceived personality, which may reveal the actual personality of the couples and thus inform relationship quality."
https://openalex.org/W4246658544,"The prevalence of and risk factors for IAD among different ethnicity groups was unknown. Our aim was to investigate the prevalence of and risk factors for IAD among Han, Uygur and Kazakh ethnicities in Xinjiang. China.In total, 14,618 adult participants (7,799 males and 6,819 females) were recruited from the Cardiovascular Risk Survey. A 4-stage stratified cluster random sampling method was used. The participants' personal information and medical history were assessed by questionnaire. IAD was diagnosed by a noninvasive arteriosclerosis analyzer.The prevalence of abnormal IAD among the general population was 14.3%, with 12.5% in the Han, 14.9% in the Uygur, and 16.4% in the Kazakh populations. The prevalence of abnormal IAD among the hypertensive population was 19.4%, with 17.0% in the Han, 18.1% in the Uygur, and 22.7% in the Kazakh populations. The prevalence of abnormal IAD increased with age (all P < 0.01) but was not significantly different between the genders (all P> 0.05). Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that age more than 45 years, obesity and hypertriglyceridemia were significantly associated with a higher prevalence of IAD. There were different risk factors for abnormal IAD in different ethnicities. Middle or old age, obesity, ABI and diabetes mellitus were risk factors for the Han population, smoking was a risk factor in the Uygur population, and obesity and PAD were risk factors in the Kazakh population.The prevalence of abnormal IAD in the Kazakh participants was higher than that in the Han and Uygur populations among both the general population and the hypertensive population in Xinjiang, China. The main risk factors of IAD were age, obesity, and triglyceride levels. Different ethnicities had different kinds of risk factors for IAD."
https://openalex.org/W2775169900,"The present study addresses the problem of sequential least square multidimensional linear regression, particularly in the case of a data stream, using a stochastic approximation process. To avoid the phenomenon of numerical explosion which can be encountered and to reduce the computing time in order to take into account a maximum of arriving data, we propose using a process with online standardized data instead of raw data and the use of several observations per step or all observations until the current step. Herein, we define and study the almost sure convergence of three processes with online standardized data: a classical process with a variable step-size and use of a varying number of observations per step, an averaged process with a constant step-size and use of a varying number of observations per step, and a process with a variable or constant step-size and use of all observations until the current step. Their convergence is obtained under more general assumptions than classical ones. These processes are compared to classical processes on 11 datasets for a fixed total number of observations used and thereafter for a fixed processing time. Analyses indicate that the third-defined process typically yields the best results."
https://openalex.org/W2785108736,"Demolition can generate fungal spore suspensions in association with various adverse health effects, such as high risk of invasive aspergillosis in immunocompromised patients. One block of Edouard Herriot Hospital was entirely demolished. The aim of the present study was to evaluate Hirst-type spore traps utility in monitoring outdoor Aspergillaceae (Aspergillus spp. + Penicillium spp.) spores in part of Edouard Herriot Hospital (Lyon, France) undergoing major demolition. Three periods were scheduled in 2015: (A) Gutting of building and asbestos removal, (B) Demolition of floors, (C) Excavation and earthwork. Outdoor Aspergillaceae fungal load was monitored by cultivable (Air Ideal®, bioMérieux) and non-cultivable methods (Lanzoni VPPS-2000, Analyzair®, Bologna, Italy). Differences of Aspergillaceae recorded with Hirst-type spore traps were observed between Gerland and Edouard Herriot Hospital. Differences between Aspergillaceae were recorded between day time and night time at Gerland and Edouard Herriot Hospital. Daily paired differences between Aspergillaceae recorded with non-cultivable methodology at Edouard Herriot Hospital and in an area without demolition work were significant in Period A vs Period B (p = 10-4) and Period A vs Period C (p = 10-4). Weak correlation of daily Aspergillaceae recorded by both methods at Edouard Herriot Hospital was significant only for Period C (r = 0.26, p = 0.048, n = 58). Meteorological parameters and type of demolition works were found to heavily influenced Aspergillaceae dispersion. Non-cultivable methodology is a promising tool for outdoor Aspergillaceae scrutiny during major demolition work in hospital, helping infection control staff to rapidly implement control measures."
