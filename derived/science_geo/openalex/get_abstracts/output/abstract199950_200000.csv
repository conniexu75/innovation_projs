https://openalex.org/W2323926328,"HAVING been informed that we had succeeded in isolating 16β-hydroxyœstrone from the urine of pregnant women, Dr. T. F. Gallagher of the Sloan-Kettering Institute, New York, most courteously suggested to us that we should publish a preliminary account of our work simultaneously with his own announcement of the detection of the same compound by reverse isotope dilution in the urine of a human subject after the administration of œstradiol-17β-16-14C (succeeding communication). The completion of our own work would have been delayed by many months if Dr. Gallagher had not provided us, before publication, with details of his method1 for synthesizing 16β-hydroxyœstrone from œstrone via the enol diacetate of the latter. It is a pleasure to acknowledge his generous co-operation."

https://openalex.org/W2007823723,"FLOREY1 and Florey and McLennan2,3 have described some of the actions of extracts of brain and spinal cord which possess an inhibitory activity on certain synaptic processes, both in mammals and in invertebrate animals. For example, these extracts, which are said to contain ‘Factor I’, can block transmission in sympathetic ganglia, can inhibit monosynaptic reflexes, can block neuromuscular transmission and the neurogenic heartbeat of Crustacea, and can inhibit the discharge of crustacean stretch receptor neurones. Bazemore, Elliott and Florey4 have reported that an active component of extracts containing Factor I is γ-aminobutyric acid. Since that time it has been shown that γ-aminobutyric acid does have effects of an inhibitory nature, especially in Crustacea5 and when applied to the mammalian cerebral cortex6. However, a comparison of the actions of Factor I and γ-aminobutyric acid on those structures where the former is active has shown that, except in Crustacea, the effects obtained with the two are not comparable, and it was concluded that they are not identical7."

https://openalex.org/W1977189912,"EFFORTS to detect extracted iodized compounds directly on chromatograms have been made by various authors while following the metabolism of thyroid hormones. Nevertheless, because of low sensitivity of the agents currently employed (ninhydrin, diazotized sulphanilic acid) this has proved fruitless. By modifying the original Sandell–Kolthoff reaction for iodine estimation, Bowden et al. 1 succeeded in detecting 0.1γ of thyroxine. The detection of thyroxine following chromatography of serum required the use of large amounts of the biological material2. Moreover, careful purification of the extract for chromatography was laborious and time-consuming. Efforts made so far1,3 have likewise failed to bring about the desired results because the colour spots are of short duration."

https://openalex.org/W2006531366,"‘Triton WR 1339’ is known to cause a marked rise of the lipæmia and cholesterolæmia when injected into experimental animals1. It has been suggested that the mechanism responsible for the enhancement of the cholesterol-level of the blood is an increased synthesis of cholesterol, chiefly in the liver2, combined with an alteration in the exchange of cholesterol between the blood and the different organs. This results in a high cholesterolæmia, with normal or even lowered cholesterol-levels in the organs3."
https://openalex.org/W2027050319,"IN a recent communication to Nature, Nicol et al.
1 reported the effect of various stilbene compounds on the phagocytic activity of the reticulo-endothelial system, intimating that stimulation was associated with certain aspects in the chemical structure, and that the strongest stimulants possessed high œstrogenicity. The present communication reports the effect on reticulo-endothelial phagocytic activity of some polyphenylated aliphatic hydrocarbons related to the synthetic œstrogens of the diphenylmethane series."
https://openalex.org/W2057175826,"WILZBACH1 has recently described a convenient method for labelling organic compounds involving their exposure to tritium gas; but both he and others2,3 found that appreciable amounts of the exchanged radioactivity appeared in traces of highly tritiated contaminants as well as in labile positions. We have applied this method to the labelling of 1 : 6-dihydroxyhexœstrol, an œstrogen analogue4, and similarly have found that impurities contain the major part of the incorporated non-labile tritium."
https://openalex.org/W2028858020,"FORTY-FOUR mature male albino rats weighing 150–180 gm. were divided into four equal groups. Two of these groups were kept at a temperature of 18° C., while the other two groups were maintained at 35° C. One group maintained at each temperature was kept continuously in light of intensity 30 ft.-candles, and the other groups were kept in darkness. After 12 days the animals were killed by decapitation under light ether anaesthesia, and their blood was collected. The levels of thyroid and thyrotrophic hormone in their serum was determined by the use of the stasis tadpole method1. The tadpoles were divided into five groups, each of twenty animals. A control group was injected with saline. The other groups of tadpoles were injected on alternate days with five injections of 0.02 ml. of serum obtained from the four groups of rats. Increase in length of the hindlimbs of the tadpole was the criterion of thyroid hormone concentration, while the increase in thyroid epithelial cell height was used as an index of thyrotrophic hormone-level in the serum of rats. The thyroids of the rats were examined histologically. They were fixed in Zenker without acetic acid and stained with Mallory's stain2. Analyses of variance and of correlation were performed."
