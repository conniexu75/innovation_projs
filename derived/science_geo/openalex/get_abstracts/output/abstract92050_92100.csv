https://openalex.org/W2082370756,"Mammalian atrial extracts possess natriuretic and diuretic activity. In experiments reported here it was found that atrial, but not ventricular, extract also causes relaxation of isolated vascular and nonvascular smooth muscle preparations. The smooth muscle relaxant activity of atrial extract was heat-stable and concentration-dependent and could be destroyed with protease. Rabbit aortic and chick rectum strips were used for the detection of atrial biological activity. The atrial activity was separated by column chromatography into two peaks having apparent molecular weights of 20,000 to 30,000 and less than 10,000. The atrial substance that copurified with the smooth muscle relaxant activity in both peaks caused natriuresis when injected into conscious rats. It appears that atria possess at least two peptides that elicit smooth muscle relaxation and natriuresis, suggesting an endogenous system of fluid volume regulation."
https://openalex.org/W2050384177,"Nuclear transplantation in the mouse embryo was achieved by using a method that combines microsurgical removal of the zygote pronuclei with the introduction of a donor nucleus by a virus-mediated cell fusion technique. Survival of embryos was greater than 90 percent in tests of this procedure. The embryos developed to term at a frequency not significantly different from that of nonmanipulated control embryos. Because nuclei and cytoplasm from genetically distinct inbred mouse strains can be efficiently interchanged, this procedure may be useful in characterizing possible cytoplasmic contributions to the embryonic and adult phenotype."
https://openalex.org/W1978996594,"Although official efforts to control air pollution have traditionally focused on outdoor air, it is now apparent that elevated contaminant concentrations are common inside some private and public buildings. Concerns about potential public health problems due to indoor air pollution are based on evidence that urban residents typically spend more than 90 percent of their time indoors, concentrations of some contaminants are higher indoors than outdoors, and for some pollutants personal exposures are not characterized adequately by outdoor measurements. Among the more important indoor contaminants associated with health or irritation effects are passive tobacco smoke, radon decay products, carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, formaldehyde, asbestos fibers, microorganisms, and aeroallergens. Efforts to assess health risks associated with indoor air pollution are limited by insufficient information about the number of people exposed, the pattern and severity of exposures, and the health consequences of exposures. An overall strategy should be developed to investigate indoor exposures, health effects, control options, and public policy alternatives."

https://openalex.org/W2073264303,"The issue of whether sleep is physiologically necessary has been unresolved because experiments that reported deleterious effects of sleep deprivation did not control for the stimuli used to prevent sleep. In this experiment, however, experimental and control rats received the same relatively mild physical stimuli, but stimulus presentations were timed to reduce sleep severely in experimental rats but not in controls. Experimental rats suffered severe pathology and death; control rats did not."
https://openalex.org/W1976133790,"Mutations in two nonessential genes specifically block the phagocytosis of cells programmed to die during development. With few exceptions, these cells still die, suggesting that, in nematodes, engulfment is not necessary for most programmed deaths. Instead, these deaths appear to occur by cell suicide."
https://openalex.org/W2038372277,"Limb buds of chicken embryos contain within the peripheral mesoderm an avascular zone that is rich in hyaluronic acid. Epithelial tissues that synthesize large amounts of hyaluronic acid relative to other glycosaminoglycans caused avascularity when implanted into normally vascular wing mesoderm. Epithelia that synthesize little hyaluronic acid did not cause avascularity. Elvax implants containing hyaluronic acid caused the formation of avascular zones, whereas similar implants containing other glycosaminoglycans did not give rise to avascular zones. Hyaluronic acid may thus play a role in determining the location of blood vessels in the embryo."
https://openalex.org/W1979422406,"Weak, pulsing electromagnetic fields can modify biological processes. The hypothesis that responses to such induced currents depend on pulse characteristics was evaluated by using transcription as the target process. Two pulses in clinical use, the repetitive single pulse and the repetitive pulse train, were tested. These pulses produced different results from each other and from controls when transcription in dipteran salivary gland cells was monitored with tritiated uridine in transcription autoradiography, cytological nick translation, and analysis of isolated RNA fractions. The single pulse increased the specific activity of messenger RNA after 15 and 45 minutes of exposure. The pulse train increased specific activity only after 45 minutes of exposure."
https://openalex.org/W2054934912,"Microvoltammetric electrodes were used to monitor dopamine released in the caudate nucleus of the rat after electrical stimulation of the medial forebrain bundle. The time resolution of the technique is sufficient to determine in vivo concentration changes on a time scale of seconds. Direct evidence identifying the substance released as dopamine was obtained both voltammetrically and pharmacologically. Administration of alpha-methyl-p-tyrosine terminates the release of dopamine, although tissue stores of dopamine are still present. Thus there appears to be a compartment for dopamine storage that is not available for immediate release. This compartment appears to be mobilized by amfonelic acid, since administration of this agent after alpha-methyl-p-tyrosine returns the concentration of dopamine released by electrical stimulation to 75 percent of the original amount."
https://openalex.org/W2086605115,"A low molecular weight, lipophilic, copper coordination complex with superoxide dismutase-mimetic activity inhibited biochemical and biological actions of a tumor promoter in mouse epidermis. Such inhibitory effects implicate reactive oxygen species in the tumor promotion process."
https://openalex.org/W1978232917,"Animals with a history of receiving daily injections of +-amphetamine in a specific environment showed a placebo effect (enhanced activity) when injected with saline and placed there; control animals with similar but dissociated drug histories and experience with the test chamber failed to show the effect. The dopamine receptor blocker pimozide antagonized the establishment of conditioning. However, the same dose of pimozide, when given to previously conditioned animals on the placebo test day, failed to antagonize the expression of conditioned activity. Thus, during conditioning dopaminergic neurons mediated a change that subsequently influenced behavior even when dopaminergic systems were blocked. Although schizophrenia may be related to hyperfunctioning of dopamine, neuroleptic drugs, which block dopamine receptors on their first administration, do not have therapeutic effects for a number of days. The results of the pimozide experiments may resolve this paradox."
https://openalex.org/W2060448151,"An age-related accumulation of D-aspartic acid was detected in the white matter of ten normal brains from individuals aged 30 to 80 years. Gray matter showed no systematic increase in D-aspartic acid. The rate constant for D-aspartate formation in the brain is equal to the predicted value calculated for 37°C. Accumulation of the uncommon D-aspartate isomer in myelinated white matter implies that there is little or no turnover of this tissue, and this may have a bearing on dysfunction of the aging brain or on other diseases of myelin."
https://openalex.org/W2061420115,"Three groups of γ-aminobutyric acid—containing neurons were found in the mammillary region of the posterior hypothalamus. The groups correspond to the tuberal, caudal, and postmammillary caudal magnocellular nuclei. Many cells in these nuclei were retrogradely labeled with fast blue after the injection of this fluorescent dye into the neocortex. Immunohistochemical experiments showed that these same neurons also contained the γ-aminobutyric acid-synthesizing enzyme glutamate decarboxylase. These results provide morphological evidence for a γ-aminobutyric acid pathway arising in magnocellular neurons of the posterior hypothalamus and innervating the neocortex."
https://openalex.org/W2040622954,"When active shortening of the cat papillary muscle was allowed at any time during a contraction, the intracellular concentration of free calcium ions, detected with the calcium-sensitive bioluminescent protein aequorin, was higher than at comparable times in isometric twitches. The difference was not attributable to the differences of length involved or to motion artifacts, and must have been related to the act of shortening or the difference in force development in the two types of contractions. This observation and the phenomenon of shortening deactivation are both consistent with the hypothesis that attachment of cross bridges increases the affinity of the myofilaments for calcium ions."

https://openalex.org/W2047695558,"In the house mouse (Mus musculus), fetuses may develop in utero next to siblings of the same or opposite sex. The amniotic fluid of the female fetuses contains higher concentrations of estradiol than that of male fetuses. Male fetuses that developed in utero between female fetuses had higher concentrations of estradiol in their amniotic fluid than males that were located between other male fetuses during intrauterine development. They were also more sexually active as adults, less aggressive, and had smaller seminal vesicles than males that had developed between other male fetuses in utero. These findings raise the possibility that during fetal life circulating estrogens may interact with circulating androgens both in regulating the development of sex differences between males and females and in producing variation in phenotype among males and among females."
https://openalex.org/W1995432992,"Inbred BALB/c females were mated and subsequently exposed in a divided cage to ""stimulus"" males or females whose H-2 type was similar or dissimilar to the stud male's. The incidence of pregnancy blocking was considerably higher when stud and stimulus males differed in H-2 type than when they did not. Similar results were obtained with urine samples of H-2 identical and nonidentical males. Females exposed after mating to other females whose H-2 type differed from the stud male, under the same experimental conditions, also showed an appreciable incidence of pregnancy block. It is therefore concluded that chemosensory recognition of H-2 types affects the reproductive hormonal status of the pregnant female."
https://openalex.org/W2069872123,"In the parafoveal retina of human observers, cone-mediated sensitivity to flicker decreases as rods become progressively more dark-adapted. This effect is greatest when a rod response to flicker is precluded. These results indicate that rods tonically inhibit cone pathways in the dark."
https://openalex.org/W2048070618,"A phosphorus-31 nuclear magnetic resonance imaging technique has been used to obtain information on phosphorus metabolites from different spatial regions of tissues in vivo. The technique for selection of planes through the tissue is based on phase-encoding of spin echoes and was used to obtain one-dimensional discrimination of phosphorus-31 spectra from different parts of the tissue simultaneously. Specimens were resolved into 16 distinct slices and a signal-to-noise ratio of about 20 to 1 was obtained in 1/2 hour. Results are presented for phantoms, rat legs, and gerbil heads."
https://openalex.org/W1979047465,"Taste cells and nongustatory epithelial cells in the isolated lingual mucosa from the mud puppy Necturus maculosus were impaled with microelectrodes. The taste cells, but not surrounding epithelial cells, were electrically excitable when directly stimulated with current passed through the recording electrode. Action potentials produced by taste cells had both a sodium and a calcium component."
https://openalex.org/W2021448126,"Gel filtration of serum at pH 3.6 yielded a fraction that supported long-term (months) survival of dissociated rat central neurons in monolayer culture more reliably than the traditionally used unfractionated serum. The cultures remained neuron-rich, because this fraction did not support the proliferation of glia and fibroblasts that occurs in whole serum. With an apparent molecular weight of 55,000 and an isoelectric point of 5.6, the active factor (or factors) in this fraction is distinct from any well-defined growth factor."
https://openalex.org/W2092893728,"Rearing cats in the dark extends the critical period for development of visual cortical neurons, which indicates that the experience of visual input is necessary to begin the developmental process. A single brief pulse of visual input (6 hours) during a period of dark-rearing eliminates delayed development in the visual cortex. Light therefore seems to rapidly trigger the developmental process, and once triggered, that process runs to completion in the absence of further input."
https://openalex.org/W2026236023,"Dicarboxylic aciduria, an inborn error of metabolism in man, is thought to be caused by defective beta-oxidation of six-carbon to ten-carbon fatty acids. Oxidation of [1-14C]octanoate was impaired in intact fibroblasts from three unrelated patients with dicarboxylic aciduria (19 percent of control), as was the activity of medium-chain (octanoyl-)acyl-CoA dehydrogenase in the supernatants of sonicated fibroblast mitochondria (5 percent of control). These data confirm that dicarboxylic aciduria is caused by an enzyme defect in the beta-oxidation cycle."

https://openalex.org/W2082799810,"Two triglyceride lipases, lipoprotein lipase and hepatic triglyceride lipase, participate in the metabolism of plasma lipoproteins. A single recessive mutation, cld, on mouse chromosome 17 causes an apparent deficiency of both lipoprotein lipase and hepatic triglyceride lipase activities. Mice homozygous for this defect develop lethal hyperchylomicronemia within 2 days postpartum as a consequence of nursing. Plasma triglyceride values in affected mice often reach 20,000 milligrams per deciliter (100 times higher than that in normal littermates), and total lipase activity in plasma or tissues is 5 to 20 percent of that in controls."
https://openalex.org/W2092330850,"When a solution of collagen molecules, at neutral pH and moderate ionic strength, is warmed from 4 degrees to 30 degrees C, a spontaneous self-assembly process takes place in which native-type collagen fibers are produced. Events occurring during thermally induced fibrillogenesis process can be monitored, in aqueous media and in real time, by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopic techniques. Tentative assignments of observed spectral bands are given."

The clones ranged in size from 700 to 1100 base pairs and were identified by partial DNA sequence analysis. One complementary DNA clone was used as a probe for hybridization with human-rodent DNA's isolated from somatic cell hybrids and bound to nitrocellulose filters (Southern blot analysis) to assign the human C-reactive protein gene to chromosome 1."
https://openalex.org/W2033436452,"In man and animals iodothyronines are metabolized by deiodination and conjugation with glucuronic acid or sulfate. Until now these processes have been regarded as independent reactions. However, in the present study a close interaction of these pathways was observed in the hepatic metabolism of 3,3'-diiodothyronine and 3,3',5-triiodothyronine. Studies with rat hepatocytes and liver microsomes indicated that sulfation of the phenolic hydroxyl group facilitates the deiodination of these compounds."
https://openalex.org/W2030804798,"Electron microscopic and spectrophotometric studies showed that salicylate causes gross swelling of mitochondria in isotonic salt solutions. In overall morphology the salicylate-treated mitochondria resembled those from patients with Reye's syndrome. Salicylate analogs such as m-hydroxybenzoate, p-hydroxybenzoate, and benzoate did not exert this effect. The mitochondria deformed by salicylate tended to return to their original condensed form on removal of the drug."
https://openalex.org/W2044240568,"The compound 2-phenylethylamine is an ""endogenous amphetamine"" which may modulate central adrenergic functions. 2-Phenylethylamine is mainly metabolized by monoamine oxidase to form phenyl acetate (PAA). The 24-hour urinary excretion of PAA was measured in normal healthy volunteers and depressed patients. Patients were diagnosed according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, edition 3. In 70 percent of healthy volunteers of both sexes, the excretion of PAA ranged between 70 and 175 milligrams per 24 hours (mean = 141.1 ± 10.2). Inpatients with major depressive disorder (unipolar type) (N = 31) excreted less PAA (68.7 ± 7.0 milligrams per 24 hours) and 55 percent of them excreted less than 70 milligrams per 24 hours; there were no significant differences in the PAA excretion between untreated patients (N = 13) and those treated with antidepressants that were not effective (N = 18). The PAA excretion was reduced to a lesser extent in 35 less severely depressed unipolar outpatients (drug-free for 1 week) (86.3 ± 11.8 milligrams per 24 hours). These results suggest that low PAA urinary excretion may be a reliable state marker for the diagnosis of some forms of unipolar major depressive disorders."

https://openalex.org/W1971689784,"An attempt was made to determine whether phosphorylation of the myosin light chain represents a thick filament-associated mechanism for modulating the rate of cross-bridge cycling in mouse skeletal muscle. When the degree of light chain phosphorylation was varied independently of tetanus duration, there was no correlation of phosphorylation with cross-bridge turnover rate, as measured by the shortening velocity of the muscle. It is concluded that in intact skeletal muscle phosphorylation of the myosin light chain does not in itself modulate cross-bridge cycling rate and that previously reported changes in cycling rate were due to other factors that may vary with tetanus duration."
https://openalex.org/W1997837517,"Dopamine was transformed into a redox chemical system for delivery to the brain. The lipoidal form allowed penetration of the blood-brain barrier. Oxidative and hydrolytic processes then transformed the delivery form into a quaternary ammonium precursor of dopamine. The quaternary ammonium precursor was rapidly eliminated from the general circulation, whereas that formed in the brain was locked in, thereby providing a significant and sustained brain-specific dopaminergic activity."
https://openalex.org/W2016225921,"An important question concerning the mechanism of somatic mutation of immunoglobulin variable (V) genes is whether it involves all of the numerous V genes in a differentiated B cell, independent of location, or if it is restricted to a particular chromosomal site. Comparison of the sequence of two alleles of a given V gene shows that the mutations are limited to the rearranged V gene, while the same V gene on the other chromosome has not undergone mutation. This indicates that a V gene sequence alone is not sufficient for somatic mutation to take place. The mutation is therefore restricted to the rearranged V gene and consequently does not occur before rearrangement."
https://openalex.org/W1994010104,"The two postembryonic touch receptor neurons in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans arise from essentially identical cell lineages and have the same ultrastructural features. The cells are found in different positions in the animal, however, and differ in neuronal branching, connectivity, and function. These structural and functional differences are not seen when cells are placed in similar positions by mutation or laser-induced damage. Thus, some, but probably not all, of the differentiated properties of these cells are a consequence of their cellular environment."

https://openalex.org/W2031666054,"The ocular circadian pacemakers of Bulla gouldiana were found to be mutually coupled, and their interaction could be observed in an isolated nervous system maintained in vitro. Experimentally induced phase separations between the two ocular pacemakers were reduced when the eyes were allowed to interact for 48 hours. The reduction in phase separation did not occur however when the cerebral commissure was severed, indicating that this neural tract is a critical pathway coupling these two circadian clocks."
https://openalex.org/W1486255956,"Transport of pyridoxal 5-phosphate (PLP) into erythrocytes was inhibited by inhibitors of anion transport including stilbene disulfonate compounds, indicating that it is mediated by Band 3 protein. When erythrocytes were treated with PLP and large amounts of free lysine and NaBH4, two membrane-spanning fragments of Band 3 (Mr = 17,000 and 35,000) were specifically labeled. When the cells were pretreated with 4,4'-dinitrostilbene 2,2'-disulfonate, the labeling in the 35,000-dalton fragment was inhibited. Erythrocytes labeled by PLP in both the 17,000- and 35,000-dalton fragments transported PLP at a decreased rate, whereas the cells labeled in only the 17,000-dalton fragment had essentially the same transport activity as the control when 4,4'-dinitrostilbene 2,2'-disulfonate was removed. The extent of inhibition of transport of inorganic phosphate in the labeled cells was similar to that of PLP. The results indicate that the 35,000-dalton fragment participates in the anion transport of the cell membrane."

By the late blastula stage, plasmid DNA sequences were detected comigrating with the high molecular weight cellular DNA (greater than 48 kilobases). Analysis of the DNA from injected embryos digested with various restriction endonuclease demonstrated that the injected DNA was integrated into the frog genome. Clones of embryos containing the pSp102 DNA sequences were produced by means of nuclear transplantation. Individuals of the same clone contain the pSp102 sequences integrated into similar chromosomal locations. These sites vary between different clones."
https://openalex.org/W2010761931,Exposure of C57BL/6J mice to ionizing radiation caused stereotypical locomotor hyperactivity similar to that produced by morphine. Naloxone administration prevented this radiation-induced behavioral activation. These results support the hypothesis that endorphins are involved in some aspects of radiogenic behavioral change.
https://openalex.org/W1983013713,"Oral administration of ethanol, n-butanol, or t-butanol to mice 20 minutes before injection of carbon-14-labeled nitrosonornicotine inhibited the localization of radioactivity in bronchial and salivary duct epithelium and in the liver. Localization of radioactivity in the nasal epithelium and esophagus was not significantly reduced. These alcohols therefore may selectively inhibit tumor formation in three of the five sites where this carcinogen typically acts."
https://openalex.org/W2030089311,"High concentrations of glucocerebroside (glucosylceramide) were found in the ventral nerve cord, brain, optic nerve, and antenna, but not in the nonneural tissue, of the brown shrimp Penaeus aztecus aztecus. This lipid contained unusual sphingoid bases consisting of 14-, 15-, and 16-carbon sphinganines and sphingenines. The fatty acids were mainly nonhydroxylated homologs 22 carbons long and longer, similar to those found in galactocerebroside but differing from those in glucocerebroside in mammalian nervous systems."
https://openalex.org/W2000985572,"Although the conductance and kinetic behavior of inhibitory synaptic channels have been studied in a number of nerve and muscle cells, there has been little if any detailed study of such channels at synapses in the vertebrate central nervous system or of the relation of such channels to natural synaptic events. In the experiments reported here, current noise measurements were used to obtain such information at synapses on Müller cells in the lamprey brainstem. Application of glycine to the cells activated synaptic channels with large conductances and relaxation time constants (70 picosiemens and 33 milliseconds, respectively, at 3 degrees to 10 degrees C). Spontaneous inhibitory synaptic currents had a mean conductance of 107 nanosiemens and decayed with the same time constant. In addition, the glycine responses and the spontaneous currents had the same reversal potential and both were abolished by strychnine. These results support the idea that glycine is the natural inhibitory transmitter at these synapses and suggest that one quantum of transmitter activates about 1500 elementary conductance channels."
