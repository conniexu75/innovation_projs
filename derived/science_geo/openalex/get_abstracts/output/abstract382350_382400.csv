https://openalex.org/W1966498224,"The canonical role of messenger RNA (mRNA) is to deliver protein-coding information to sites of protein synthesis. However, given that microRNAs bind to RNAs, we hypothesized that RNAs could possess a regulatory role that relies on their ability to compete for microRNA binding, independently of their protein-coding function. As a model for the protein-coding-independent role of RNAs, we describe the functional relationship between the mRNAs produced by the PTEN tumour suppressor gene and its pseudogene PTENP1 and the critical consequences of this interaction. We find that PTENP1 is biologically active as it can regulate cellular levels of PTEN and exert a growth-suppressive role. We also show that the PTENP1 locus is selectively lost in human cancer. We extended our analysis to other cancer-related genes that possess pseudogenes, such as oncogenic KRAS. We also demonstrate that the transcripts of protein-coding genes such as PTEN are biologically active. These findings attribute a novel biological role to expressed pseudogenes, as they can regulate coding gene expression, and reveal a non-coding function for mRNAs."
https://openalex.org/W2141642891,"By combining genome-wide association data from 8,130 individuals with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and 38,987 controls of European descent and following up previously unidentified meta-analysis signals in a further 34,412 cases and 59,925 controls, we identified 12 new T2D association signals with combined P<5x10(-8). These include a second independent signal at the KCNQ1 locus; the first report, to our knowledge, of an X-chromosomal association (near DUSP9); and a further instance of overlap between loci implicated in monogenic and multifactorial forms of diabetes (at HNF1A). The identified loci affect both beta-cell function and insulin action, and, overall, T2D association signals show evidence of enrichment for genes involved in cell cycle regulation. We also show that a high proportion of T2D susceptibility loci harbor independent association signals influencing apparently unrelated complex traits."
https://openalex.org/W1985361258,"The accumulation of species-specific enemies around adults is hypothesized to maintain plant diversity by limiting the recruitment of conspecific seedlings relative to heterospecific seedlings. Although previous studies in forested ecosystems have documented patterns consistent with the process of negative feedback, these studies are unable to address which classes of enemies (for example, pathogens, invertebrates, mammals) exhibit species-specific effects strong enough to generate negative feedback, and whether negative feedback at the level of the individual tree is sufficient to influence community-wide forest composition. Here we use fully reciprocal shade-house and field experiments to test whether the performance of conspecific tree seedlings (relative to heterospecific seedlings) is reduced when grown in the presence of enemies associated with adult trees. Both experiments provide strong evidence for negative plant-soil feedback mediated by soil biota. In contrast, above-ground enemies (mammals, foliar herbivores and foliar pathogens) contributed little to negative feedback observed in the field. In both experiments, we found that tree species that showed stronger negative feedback were less common as adults in the forest community, indicating that susceptibility to soil biota may determine species relative abundance in these tropical forests. Finally, our simulation models confirm that the strength of local negative feedback that we measured is sufficient to produce the observed community-wide patterns in tree-species relative abundance. Our findings indicate that plant-soil feedback is an important mechanism that can maintain species diversity and explain patterns of tree-species relative abundance in tropical forests."
https://openalex.org/W2411288489,"Cells operate in dynamic environments using extraordinary communication capabilities that emerge from the interactions of genetic circuitry. The mammalian immune response is a striking example of the coordination of different cell types. Cell-to-cell communication is primarily mediated by signalling molecules that form spatiotemporal concentration gradients, requiring cells to respond to a wide range of signal intensities. Here we use high-throughput microfluidic cell culture and fluorescence microscopy, quantitative gene expression analysis and mathematical modelling to investigate how single mammalian cells respond to different concentrations of the signalling molecule tumour-necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, and relay information to the gene expression programs by means of the transcription factor nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB. We measured NF-kappaB activity in thousands of live cells under TNF-alpha doses covering four orders of magnitude. We find, in contrast to population-level studies with bulk assays, that the activation is heterogeneous and is a digital process at the single-cell level with fewer cells responding at lower doses. Cells also encode a subtle set of analogue parameters to modulate the outcome; these parameters include NF-kappaB peak intensity, response time and number of oscillations. We developed a stochastic mathematical model that reproduces both the digital and analogue dynamics as well as most gene expression profiles at all measured conditions, constituting a broadly applicable model for TNF-alpha-induced NF-kappaB signalling in various types of cells. These results highlight the value of high-throughput quantitative measurements with single-cell resolution in understanding how biological systems operate."
https://openalex.org/W2047607345,"Tumour-necrosis factor (TNF) receptor-associated factor 2 (TRAF2) is a key component in NF-kappaB signalling triggered by TNF-alpha. Genetic evidence indicates that TRAF2 is necessary for the polyubiquitination of receptor interacting protein 1 (RIP1) that then serves as a platform for recruitment and stimulation of IkappaB kinase, leading to activation of the transcription factor NF-kappaB. Although TRAF2 is a RING domain ubiquitin ligase, direct evidence that TRAF2 catalyses the ubiquitination of RIP1 is lacking. TRAF2 binds to sphingosine kinase 1 (SphK1), one of the isoenzymes that generates the pro-survival lipid mediator sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) inside cells. Here we show that SphK1 and the production of S1P is necessary for lysine-63-linked polyubiquitination of RIP1, phosphorylation of IkappaB kinase and IkappaBalpha, and IkappaBalpha degradation, leading to NF-kappaB activation. These responses were mediated by intracellular S1P independently of its cell surface G-protein-coupled receptors. S1P specifically binds to TRAF2 at the amino-terminal RING domain and stimulates its E3 ligase activity. S1P, but not dihydro-S1P, markedly increased recombinant TRAF2-catalysed lysine-63-linked, but not lysine-48-linked, polyubiquitination of RIP1 in vitro in the presence of the ubiquitin conjugating enzymes (E2) UbcH13 or UbcH5a. Our data show that TRAF2 is a novel intracellular target of S1P, and that S1P is the missing cofactor for TRAF2 E3 ubiquitin ligase activity, indicating a new paradigm for the regulation of lysine-63-linked polyubiquitination. These results also highlight the key role of SphK1 and its product S1P in TNF-alpha signalling and the canonical NF-kappaB activation pathway important in inflammatory, antiapoptotic and immune processes."
https://openalex.org/W1997043944,"Most of the known exoplanets were discovered using the radial velocity method, measuring the 'wobble' induced in the host stars by their orbiting companions. If the orbital velocity of the planet can also be determined, it becomes possible to calculate the masses of both the star and its exoplanet without the need for further assumptions or model dependencies. That has now been achieved for the well-studied 'hot Jupiter' HD 209458b, based on spectroscopic measurements of the changing Doppler shift of molecular absorption lines of carbon monoxide, observed as the planet passed between its host star and the Earth. The masses of the star and planet are 1.00±0.22 solar masses and 0.64±0.09 jovian masses respectively. Also revealed — as blueshift of the carbon monoxide signal with respect to host star velocity — a strong wind flowing at high altitude from the irradiated dayside to the non-irradiated nightside of the planet. If the orbital velocity of an extrasolar planet could be determined, the masses of both the planet and its host star could be calculated using Newton's law of gravity. Here, high-dispersion ground-based spectroscopy of a transit of the extrasolar planet HD 209458b is reported. This allowed the radial component of the planet's orbital velocity to be calculated, and thus the masses of star and planet. Moreover, a strong wind flowing from the irradiated dayside to the non-irradiated nightside of the planet is suggested. For extrasolar planets discovered using the radial velocity method1, the spectral characterization of the host star leads to a mass estimate of the star and subsequently of the orbiting planet. If the orbital velocity of the planet could be determined, the masses of both star and planet could be calculated using Newton’s law of gravity, just as in the case of stellar double-line eclipsing binaries. Here we report high-dispersion ground-based spectroscopy of a transit of the extrasolar planet HD 209458b. We see a significant wavelength shift in absorption lines from carbon monoxide in the planet’s atmosphere, which we conclude arises from a change in the radial component of the planet’s orbital velocity. The masses of the star and planet are 1.00 ± 0.22MSun and 0.64 ± 0.09MJup respectively. A blueshift of the carbon monoxide signal of approximately 2 km s−1 with respect to the systemic velocity of the host star suggests the presence of a strong wind flowing from the irradiated dayside to the non-irradiated nightside of the planet within the 0.01–0.1 mbar atmospheric pressure range probed by these observations. The strength of the carbon monoxide signal suggests a carbon monoxide mixing ratio of (1–3) × 10−3 in this planet’s upper atmosphere."
https://openalex.org/W2057409808,"We use our sense of time to identify temporal relationships between events and to anticipate actions. The degree to which we can exploit temporal contingencies depends on the variability of our measurements of time. We asked humans to reproduce time intervals drawn from different underlying distributions. As expected, production times were more variable for longer intervals. However, production times exhibited a systematic regression toward the mean. Consequently, estimates for a sample interval differed depending on the distribution from which it was drawn. A performance-optimizing Bayesian model that takes the underlying distribution of samples into account provided an accurate description of subjects' performance, variability and bias. This finding suggests that the CNS incorporates knowledge about temporal uncertainty to adapt internal timing mechanisms to the temporal statistics of the environment."

https://openalex.org/W2110711494,"Epidermal homeostasis depends on a balance between stem cell renewal and differentiation and is regulated by extrinsic signals from the extracellular matrix (ECM). A powerful approach to analysing the pathways involved is to engineer single-cell microenvironments in which individual variables are precisely and quantitatively controlled. Here, we employ micropatterned surfaces to identify the signalling pathways by which restricted ECM contact triggers human epidermal stem cells to initiate terminal differentiation. On small (20 microm diameter) circular islands, keratinocytes remained rounded, and differentiated at higher frequency than cells that could spread on large (50 microm diameter) islands. Differentiation did not depend on ECM composition or density. Rather, the actin cytoskeleton mediated shape-induced differentiation by regulating serum response factor (SRF) transcriptional activity. Knockdown of SRF or its co-factor MAL inhibited differentiation, whereas overexpression of MAL stimulated SRF activity and involucrin expression. SRF target genes FOS and JUNB were also required for differentiation: c-Fos mediated serum responsiveness, whereas JunB was regulated by actin and MAL. Our findings demonstrate how biophysical cues are transduced into transcriptional responses that determine epidermal cell fate."
https://openalex.org/W2042344660,"The variant form of the human syndrome xeroderma pigmentosum (XPV) is caused by a deficiency in DNA polymerase eta (Poleta), a DNA polymerase that enables replication through ultraviolet-induced pyrimidine dimers. Here we report high-resolution crystal structures of human Poleta at four consecutive steps during DNA synthesis through cis-syn cyclobutane thymine dimers. Poleta acts like a 'molecular splint' to stabilize damaged DNA in a normal B-form conformation. An enlarged active site accommodates the thymine dimer with excellent stereochemistry for two-metal ion catalysis. Two residues conserved among Poleta orthologues form specific hydrogen bonds with the lesion and the incoming nucleotide to assist translesion synthesis. On the basis of the structures, eight Poleta missense mutations causing XPV can be rationalized as undermining the molecular splint or perturbing the active-site alignment. The structures also provide an insight into the role of Poleta in replicating through D loop and DNA fragile sites."
https://openalex.org/W2088143327,"Microorganisms that breach the body's external defences and enter the lymphatic system are liable to be captured by the lymph nodes, and recent work showed that a subset of macrophages found in the subcapsular sinus (SCS) of lymph nodes is critical for clearance of viruses from the lymph and for initiating antiviral humoral immune responses. Now a third function for SCS macrophages has been identified: the prevention of lymph-borne neurotropic viruses from infecting the CNS. Using vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) as a model, Iannacone et al. showed that local depletion of SCS macrophages made mice injected subcutaneously with VSV more vulnerable to the virus via a mechanism dependent on type I interferon. VSV is a relative of rabies virus typically transmitted by insect bites, causing a fatal paralytic disease in some mammals. Combined with further experiments in mice lacking the IFN-I receptor, these findings suggest that SCS macrophages are crucial gatekeepers to the CNS that prevent fatal viral neuroinvasion upon peripheral infection. Macrophages that populate the lymph nodes are known to clear viruses from the lymph and to initiate antiviral humoral immune responses. It is now shown that these macrophages also have another function: they prevent lymph-borne neurotropic viruses from entering the central nervous system. The mechanism is dependent on the production of type I interferon. Lymph nodes (LNs) capture microorganisms that breach the body’s external barriers and enter draining lymphatics, limiting the systemic spread of pathogens1. Recent work has shown that CD11b+CD169+ macrophages, which populate the subcapsular sinus (SCS) of LNs, are critical for the clearance of viruses from the lymph and for initiating antiviral humoral immune responses2,3,4. Here we show, using vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), a relative of rabies virus transmitted by insect bites, that SCS macrophages perform a third vital function: they prevent lymph-borne neurotropic viruses from infecting the central nervous system (CNS). On local depletion of LN macrophages, about 60% of mice developed ascending paralysis and died 7–10 days after subcutaneous infection with a small dose of VSV, whereas macrophage-sufficient animals remained asymptomatic and cleared the virus. VSV gained access to the nervous system through peripheral nerves in macrophage-depleted LNs. In contrast, within macrophage-sufficient LNs VSV replicated preferentially in SCS macrophages but not in adjacent nerves. Removal of SCS macrophages did not compromise adaptive immune responses against VSV, but decreased type I interferon (IFN-I) production within infected LNs. VSV-infected macrophages recruited IFN-I-producing plasmacytoid dendritic cells to the SCS and in addition were a major source of IFN-I themselves. Experiments in bone marrow chimaeric mice revealed that IFN-I must act on both haematopoietic and stromal compartments, including the intranodal nerves, to prevent lethal infection with VSV. These results identify SCS macrophages as crucial gatekeepers to the CNS that prevent fatal viral invasion of the nervous system on peripheral infection."
https://openalex.org/W1965521903,"The lipocalins are secreted proteins that bind small organic molecules. Scn-Ngal (also known as neutrophil gelatinase associated lipocalin, siderocalin, lipocalin 2) sequesters bacterial iron chelators, called siderophores, and consequently blocks bacterial growth. However, Scn-Ngal is also prominently expressed in aseptic diseases, implying that it binds additional ligands and serves additional functions. Using chemical screens, crystallography and fluorescence methods, we report that Scn-Ngal binds iron together with a small metabolic product called catechol. The formation of the complex blocked the reactivity of iron and permitted its transport once introduced into circulation in vivo. Scn-Ngal then recycled its iron in endosomes by a pH-sensitive mechanism. As catechols derive from bacterial and mammalian metabolism of dietary compounds, the Scn-Ngal-catechol-Fe(III) complex represents an unforeseen microbial-host interaction, which mimics Scn-Ngal-siderophore interactions but instead traffics iron in aseptic tissues. These results identify an endogenous siderophore, which may link the disparate roles of Scn-Ngal in different diseases."

https://openalex.org/W1990622714,"The ability to control the activity of cellular signaling pathways is useful for dissecting their functions. Using a short protein insert, Karginov et al. engineer protein kinases that can be specifically activated by the small-molecule rapamycin. Studies of cellular and tissue dynamics benefit greatly from tools that can control protein activity with specificity and precise timing in living systems. Here we describe an approach to confer allosteric regulation specifically on the catalytic activity of protein kinases. A highly conserved portion of the kinase catalytic domain is modified with a small protein insert that inactivates catalytic activity but does not affect other protein functions (Fig. 1a). Catalytic activity is restored by addition of rapamycin or non-immunosuppresive rapamycin analogs. Molecular modeling and mutagenesis indicate that the protein insert reduces activity by increasing the flexibility of the catalytic domain. Drug binding restores activity by increasing rigidity. We demonstrate the approach by specifically activating focal adhesion kinase (FAK) within minutes in living cells and show that FAK is involved in the regulation of membrane dynamics. Successful regulation of Src and p38 by insertion of the rapamycin-responsive element at the same conserved site used in FAK suggests that our strategy will be applicable to other kinases."

Although coatomer shares a common evolutionary origin with COPII and clathrin vesicle coat proteins, the architectural relationship among the three cages is unclear. Strikingly, the αβ′-COP core of coatomer crystallizes as a triskelion in which three copies of a β′-COP β-propeller domain converge through their axial ends. We infer that the trimer constitutes the vertex of the COPI cage. Our model proposes that the COPI cage is intermediate in design between COPII and clathrin: COPI shares with clathrin an arrangement of three curved α-solenoid legs radiating from a common center, and COPI shares with COPII highly similar vertex interactions involving the axial ends of β-propeller domains.

Budding occurs when cytoplasmic coat protein (COP) complexes assemble on a membrane surface, where they capture cargo proteins and polymerize into spherical cages to deform the membrane into a bud. Eukaryotic cells contain a series of COP complexes: COPI, which buds vesicles from the Golgi apparatus, COPII, which operates at the endoplasmic reticulum, and clathrin/adaptin, which is involved in budding from the plasma membrane, trans-Golgi network, and endosomal compartments (Bonifacino and Glick, 2004Bonifacino J.S.

COPI-coated vesicles form on the Golgi apparatus by the stepwise recruitment of two cytosolic components: an ARF-family G protein and coatomer, a 550 kDa cytoplasmic complex of seven COPs—α-, β-, β′-, γ-, δ-, ɛ-, and ζ-COP (Waters et al., 1991Waters M.G.

Budding is initiated by the exchange of GDP for GTP on ARF catalyzed by a Golgi-localized guanine-nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) of the Sec7 family (Peyroche et al., 1996Peyroche A. Paris S.

ARF-GTP binds to the membrane by embedding an N-terminal α helix in the bilayer and in turn recruits coatomer through a direct, GTP-dependent interaction (Antonny et al., 1997Antonny B.

The clathrin cage is built from triskelion assembly units—trimers of clathrin heavy chain—that are centered on the vertices of the cage, and the long α-solenoid legs curve toward and interdigitate with neighboring legs as they extend to the adjacent vertices (Fotin et al., 2004Fotin A.

Like clathrin, the COPII cage is formed from α-solenoid and β-propeller protein domains, reflecting their common evolutionary origin, but the cage architecture is quite distinct. The COPII cage assembly unit—two copies of Sec13/31—is a 28 nm long rod comprising a central α-solenoid dimer capped by two β-propeller domains at each end. The rod forms the edge of a cuboctahedron cage, and four rods converge to form the vertex with no interdigitation of assembly units (Stagg et al., 2006Stagg S.M. Gürkan C. Fowler D.M. LaPointe P.

Far less is known about the architecture of the COPI coat, as neither EM reconstructions of the cage nor crystal structures of coatomer complexes have been reported. The cargo-binding and cage-forming portions of coatomer remain together in cytosol and bind en bloc to Golgi membranes during COPI coat assembly, unlike the stepwise accretion of clathrin and COPII coats (Hara-Kuge et al., 1994Hara-Kuge S.

A tetrameric complex, βδ/γζ-COP, is identified as the cargo-binding portion on the basis of its sequence similarity to the AP complex. The cage-forming trimer, the αβ′ɛ-COP complex, is composed of α-solenoid and β-propeller domains like clathrin and the Sec13/31 cage protein of COPII. The realization that α-solenoid and β-propeller domains form the building blocks of COPI, COPII, and clathrin cage proteins, as well as the central proteins of the nuclear pore complex, led to the proposal of a common evolutionary origin for these membrane-curving devices (Devos et al., 2004Devos D.

Indeed, the symmetry and domain arrangements of clathrin and COPII cages are so distinct as to call into question the proposal of an underlying relationship. In this study, we describe the characterization and crystal structures of αβ′-COP and αɛ-COP subcomplexes of the coatomer cage. On the basis of this analysis, we propose a model for the COPI cage based on a triskelion vertex with striking similarities to both COPII and clathrin. Coatomer purified from mammalian cytosol is a heptameric protein that can be disassembled using high salt concentrations into stable βδ/γζ-COP and αβ′ɛ-COP complexes (Lowe and Kreis, 1995Lowe M. Kreis T.E. In vitro assembly and disassembly of coatomer.J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31364-31371Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). To study the cage-forming αβ′ɛ-COP complex in isolation, we prepared the trimeric protein from Bos taurus by coexpression in baculovirus-infected insect cells. The purified αβ′ɛ-COP protein was soluble despite the absence of βδ/γζ-COP, and it migrated as a large (∼600 kDa) particle on size-exclusion chromatography columns. To define domain boundaries and identify protein interactions in the αβ′ɛ-COP complex, we digested the protein with subtilisin and analyzed the proteolysis products by chromatography, SDS-PAGE, and N-terminal sequencing (see the Experimental Procedures). Three major protease-resistant products were obtained (see Figure 1): a subcomplex comprising almost full-length β′-COP and a central α-solenoid domain of α-COP, a C-terminal domain of α-COP bound to essentially full-length ɛ-COP (this interaction was identified previously by Eugster et al., 2000Eugster A. Frigerio G. Dale M. Duden R. COP I domains required for coatomer integrity, and novel interactions with ARF and ARF-GAP.EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3905-3917Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), and an N-terminal region of α-COP that includes the β-propeller domain. (This final α-COP product was more difficult to define since a loop within the β-propeller domain is nicked by subtilisin in the vicinity of residue 191.) The results of this preliminary analysis suggested that the αβ′-COP and αɛ-COP subcomplexes are amenable to structural analysis. Indeed, we were able to determine the crystal structures of both subcomplexes, as described below. Together, they account for more than two thirds of the mass of the αβ′ɛ-COP complex. Crystals of the B. taurus αɛ-COP heterodimer grew in space group I422. The structure was determined by the multiwavelength anomalous diffraction method using selenium as the anomalous scatterer (see Table 1 and the Experimental Procedures). The assignment of residues during model building was aided by the selenium atom positions, and the structure was refined with data to 2.6 Å resolution.Table 1Data Collection and Refinement Statisticsαβ′ɛ Subcomplexαβ′αβ′αβ′αβ′αβ′αɛαɛData SetNative1Native2TA6Br121TA6Br122ThimerosalMADNativeSpace groupP3221P3221P3221P3221P3221I422I422Cell parameters a, b, c (Å)152.6, 152.6, 294.5153.3, 153.3, 296.0153.3, 153.3, 296.1151.8, 151.8, 294.1152.6, 152.6, 295.6176.9, 176.9, 141.5176.6, 176.6, 141.2Data ProcessingPeakInflectionRemoteWavelength (Å)0.97901.00901.24241.24241.00090.97920.97940.96420.9794Resolution (Å)25–2.535–3.135–3.535–3.435–3.235–3.035–3.035–3.050–2.6Rmerge (%)aRmerge = 100 × ∑h∑i | Ii(h) − <I(h)> | / ∑h <I(h)>, where Ii(h) is the ith measurement and <I(h)> is the weighted mean of all measurement of I(h) for Miller indices h.7.7 (39.9)bThe highest-resolution shell is shown in parenthesis.9.1 (37.9)bThe highest-resolution shell is shown in parenthesis.11.9 (39.2)9.0 (32.3)8.7 (34.8)7.7 (36.0)6.9 (45.7)8.6 (50.3)5.0 (38.3)I/σ19.6 (2.8)20.7 (4.3)8.8 (2.0)9.5 (2.4)14.8 (3.0)13.8 (2.3)13.1 (1.9)12.1 (1.9)28.8 (3.3)Completeness (%)96.3 (92.3)96.5 (97.2)92.6 (92.3)95.3 (97.2)93.3 (95.2)89.3 (94.1)90.0 (94.1)85.7 (92.6)99.3 (98.8)Redundancy3.2 (3.0)5.3 (5.3)1.9 (1.9)1.6 (1.6)2.4 (2.4)2.1 (2.1)2.1 (2.1)2.0 (2.0)3.9 (3.8)Phasing power1.21.31.0Refinement StatisticsData range (Å)25–2.530–2.6Reflections12508132909Nonhydrogen atoms234634874Water molecules27034Rms Δ bonds (Å)cRoot-mean-square deviation (rms Δ) from target geometries.0.0070.007Rms Δ angles (°)cRoot-mean-square deviation (rms Δ) from target geometries.1.361.38R factor (%)dR factor = 100 × ∑|FP – FP(calc)|/∑ FP.22.122.2Rfree (%)dR factor = 100 × ∑|FP – FP(calc)|/∑ FP., eRfree was calculated with 5% of the data.27.226.3a Rmerge = 100 × ∑h∑i | Ii(h) − <I(h)> | / ∑h <I(h)>, where Ii(h) is the ith measurement and <I(h)> is the weighted mean of all measurement of I(h) for Miller indices h.b The highest-resolution shell is shown in parenthesis.c Root-mean-square deviation (rms Δ) from target geometries.d R factor = 100 × ∑|FP – FP(calc)|/∑ FP.e Rfree was calculated with 5% of the data. Open table in a new tab It proved more difficult to determine the structure of the αβ′-COP subcomplex. Initially, we obtained crystals of αβ′-COP from B. taurus, but they were of low crystallographic quality. Instead, the equivalent αβ′-COP subcomplex from Saccharomyces cerevisiae (residues 1–814 of β′-COP and residues 642–818 of α-COP) crystallized in space group P3221, with three copies of αβ′-COP—a total of 330 kDa—in the asymmetric unit. The structure was determined by the multiple isomorphous replacement method using crystals derivatized with Ta6Br12 and mercury compounds (see the Experimental Procedures). The structure of the yeast αβ′-COP subcomplex was refined to 2.5 Å resolution (Table 1). The αβ′-COP subcomplex is the more enlightening of the two crystal structures, so we discuss the αɛ-COP subcomplex only briefly here. The molecular models of the two subcomplexes are presented in Figure 2, Figure 3. The αβ′-COP and αɛ-COP crystal structures do not share any overlapping elements. Rather, the two subcomplexes are connected by a highly acidic ∼80 residue linker region of α-COP (residues 818–900) that may be unstructured according to our proteolysis results (Figure 1). This suggests that the 65 kDa αɛ-COP subcomplex is flexibly linked to a larger core region of αβ′ɛ-COP (Figures 3C and 3D). This is reminiscent of the C-terminal α-solenoid domain of Sec31 in the COPII cage, which is flexibly linked to the assembly unit core and probably projects from the cage in toward the membrane vesicle (Fath et al., 2007Fath S.

In the picture α-COP is colored green and ɛ-COP is red. See also Figure S1, Figure S3, and Figure S4. The sequence of ɛ-COP contains tetratricopeptide repeats (TPR), and the αɛ-COP crystal structure reveals that ɛ-COP forms a characteristic TPR-protein superhelix (Das et al., 1998Das A.K. Cohen P.W. Barford D. The structure of the tetratricopeptide repeats of protein phosphatase 5: implications for TPR-mediated protein-protein interactions.EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1192-1199Crossref PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar), which coils like a snake around one end of α-COP, to form tight dimer contacts (Figure 3D). Starting from its N terminus, the TPR domain of ɛ-COP coils in a right-handed fashion along one end of the 80-Å-long rod-shaped α-COP molecule. The TPR domain ends at residue 280, and the C-terminal 20 residues of ɛ-COP form a final α helix that makes additional contacts with α-COP, so that ɛ-COP envelops about one-third of the α-COP rod in total. The α-COP C-terminal domain has a mixed tertiary structure of five discrete elements: an N-terminal mostly helical region (residues 915–965), a β-hairpin “finger” (residues 967–983) that is encircled by ɛ-COP, a three-helix bundle (residues 1003–1074) followed by a short α-solenoid region (residues 1078–1151), and finally a nest of three orthogonally oriented β-hairpins (residues 1165–1210) toward the C terminus of the molecule. Overall, the 65 kDa αɛ-COP subcomplex is a compact rod, 115 Å long and ∼35 Å diameter. Its possible location relative to other elements in the COPI lattice is discussed below. The αβ′-COP subcomplex forms a curved structure composed of the 90 kDa β′-COP molecule and 20 kDa α-COP α-solenoid domain (Figure 1, Figure 2). β′-COP has the domain arrangement β-propeller-β-propeller-α-solenoid, and three copies of the αβ′-COP subcomplex converge through the N-terminal β-propeller domains to form a triskelion (Figure 2, Figure 3). The α-solenoid domain of α-COP binds in an antiparallel manner to the α-solenoid of β′-COP to extend the legs of the triskelion (Figures 3A and 3C), so that each of the legs is approximately 175 Å along the curved path and 120 Å measured radially (both distances are measured from the triskelion center). The αβ′-COP triskelion does not form around a crystallographic three-fold axis; rather, the three copies of αβ′-COP come together in the asymmetric unit of the crystal. Indeed, the interfacial contacts at the center of the triskelion are not exactly three-fold related, and the long α-solenoid legs deviate incrementally from the three-fold relation the farther they extend from the triskelion center, as might be expected for noncrystallographic symmetry. Finally, the molecular model we have built for β′-COP most likely includes the entirety of the structured portion of the molecule. A C-terminal element (75–100 residues in yeast and mammalian sequences; see Figure 1) of the β′-COP polypeptide was omitted from the crystallographic study, but we conclude that this region is probably unstructured since it is highly acidic and its sequence is not conserved (indeed, this C-terminal element is absent in β′-COP from Schizosaccharomyces pombe). The arrangement of protein domains in the β′-COP subunit is remarkably similar to that observed in the Sec13/31 complex of the COPII cage [which forms one half of the (Sec13/31)2 assembly unit (Fath et al., 2007Fath S. Mancias J.D. Bi X. Goldberg J. Structure and organization of coat proteins in the COPII cage.Cell. 2007; 129: 1325-1336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar)]. Sec13/31 adopts a β-propeller-β-propeller-α-solenoid arrangement in which the small Sec13 subunit forms the second β-propeller domain and is thus sandwiched between the N-terminal β-propeller and C-terminal α-solenoid domains of Sec31. The β-propeller domains of β′-COP, like Sec13/31, both comprise seven blades (Figure S1 available online and Figure 4B ). The N-terminal β-propeller (residues 1–301) is characterized by a regular and compact structure involving short connecting loops between the β strands at both axial ends of the β-propeller. The effect is to create relatively flat axial ends, which seems to be important for interactions at the triskelion center (Figure 3, Figure 4). The C-terminal β-propeller (residues 304–600) interacts with the N-terminal β-propeller through a relatively small interaction area, whereby loops contributed from blades 1, 2, and 7 of the C-terminal β-propeller interact with residues on loops 5, 6, and 7 of the N-terminal β-propeller (see Figure S1 for the numbering scheme). The small interaction area suggests that there might be some flexibility at this site connecting the two β-propellers. Sites of potential flexibility have been identified in the COPII (Sec13/31)2 assembly unit, and these are proposed to be important for lattice adaptability and the formation of different size cages (Lederkremer et al., 2001Lederkremer G.Z.

In particular, the axes of the β-propeller domains of Sec13 and Sec31 are inclined at a 50° angle, and the domains are displaced ∼15 Å from each other. The β-propeller domains of β′-COP are juxtaposed in a slightly different configuration. The axes of the two β-propellers are almost parallel (as can be seen most clearly in Figure 4C, which is viewed along the β-propeller axes and reveals the “pore” of each domain), and the axes are displaced ∼25 Å from each other. However, the prevailing observation in this context is that the polarity of the β-propeller domains is conserved in COPI and COPII (the arrows in Figure 5 are meant to convey this relationship). Finally, a characteristic feature of the αβ′-COP subcomplex is the ∼90° angle between the axes of the α-solenoid and the C-terminal β-propeller domain, which helps to create curvature and yields the triskelion form of the trimer (Figure 2, Figure 3). The similarity of the curved aspect to clathrin heavy chain suggests that this is almost certainly an importan"
https://openalex.org/W2008964034,"TMEM16A was found recently to be a calcium-activated Cl(-) channel (CaCC). CaCCs perform important functions in cell physiology, including regulation of epithelial secretion, cardiac and neuronal excitability, and smooth muscle contraction. CaCC modulators are of potential utility for treatment of hypertension, diarrhea, and cystic fibrosis. Screening of drug and natural product collections identified tannic acid as an inhibitor of TMEM16A, with IC(50) ∼ 6 μM and ∼100% inhibition at higher concentrations. Tannic acid inhibited CaCCs in multiple cell types but did not affect CFTR Cl(-) channels. Structure-activity analysis indicated the requirement of gallic or digallic acid substituents on a macromolecular scaffold (gallotannins), as are present in green tea and red wine. Other polyphenolic components of teas and wines, including epicatechin, catechin, and malvidin-3-glucoside, poorly inhibited CaCCs. Remarkably, a 1000-fold dilution of red wine and 100-fold dilution of green tea inhibited CaCCs by >50%. Tannic acid, red wine, and green tea inhibited arterial smooth muscle contraction and intestinal Cl(-) secretion. Gallotannins are thus potent CaCC inhibitors whose biological activity provides a potential molecular basis for the cardioprotective and antisecretory benefits of red wine and green tea."

We present the crystal structures of Saccharomyces cerevisiae Poleta (also known as RAD30) in ternary complex with a cis-syn thymine-thymine (T-T) dimer and with undamaged DNA. The structures reveal that the ability of Poleta to replicate efficiently through the ultraviolet-induced lesion derives from a simple and yet elegant mechanism, wherein the two Ts of the T-T dimer are accommodated in an active site cleft that is much more open than in other polymerases. We also show by structural, biochemical and genetic analysis that the two Ts are maintained in a stable configuration in the active site via interactions with Gln 55, Arg 73 and Met 74. Together, these features define the basis for Poleta's action on ultraviolet-damaged DNA that is crucial in suppressing the mutagenic and carcinogenic consequences of sun exposure, thereby reducing the incidence of skin cancers in humans."
https://openalex.org/W1985299376,"Although general inhibitors of the ubiquitin-proteasome system have been reported, compounds targeting specific ubiquitylation enzymes should be beneficial in clinical applications and basic research. Orlicky et al. present an allosteric inhibitor specific to the yeast SCFCdc4 E3 ligase that prevents binding of the target protein to the WD40 domain of the complex. The specificity of SCF ubiquitin ligase–mediated protein degradation is determined by F-box proteins1,2. We identified a biplanar dicarboxylic acid compound, called SCF-I2, as an inhibitor of substrate recognition by the yeast F-box protein Cdc4 using a fluorescence polarization screen to monitor the displacement of a fluorescein-labeled phosphodegron peptide. SCF-I2 inhibits the binding and ubiquitination of full-length phosphorylated substrates by SCFCdc4. A co-crystal structure reveals that SCF-I2 inserts itself between the β-strands of blades 5 and 6 of the WD40 propeller domain of Cdc4 at a site that is 25 Å away from the substrate binding site. Long-range transmission of SCF-I2 interactions distorts the substrate binding pocket and impedes recognition of key determinants in the Cdc4 phosphodegron. Mutation of the SCF-I2 binding site abrogates its inhibitory effect and explains specificity in the allosteric inhibition mechanism. Mammalian WD40 domain proteins may exhibit similar allosteric responsiveness and hence represent an extensive class of druggable target."
https://openalex.org/W2165451118,"Autophagy, the process by which a cell digests its own components in the lysosomes, is an ancient and well-conserved pathway that acts as a survival response to starvation but has also been associated with cell death. In this study, McPhee et al. identify the first factor that regulates autophagy during cell death, but not during cell survival. They find that in Drosophila, the engulfment receptor Draper is a critical regulator of autophagy during cell death of Drosophila salivary glands but is not required for starvation-induced autophagy during fat body cell survival. This is the first example of an engulfment factor that is autonomously required for self-clearance. Autophagy degrades cytoplasmic components that are required for cell survival in response to starvation1. Autophagy has also been associated with cell death, but it is unclear how this is distinguished from autophagy during cell survival. Drosophila salivary glands undergo programmed cell death that requires autophagy genes2, and engulfment of salivary gland cells by phagocytes does not appear to occur3. Here we show that Draper (Drpr), the Drosophila melanogaster orthologue of the Caenorhabditis elegans engulfment receptor CED-1, is required for autophagy during cell death. Null mutations in, and salivary gland-specific knockdown of, drpr inhibit salivary gland degradation. Knockdown of drpr prevents the induction of autophagy in dying salivary glands, and expression of the Atg1 autophagy regulator in drpr mutants suppresses the failure in degradation of salivary glands. Surprisingly, drpr is required in the same dying salivary gland cells in which it regulates autophagy induction, but drpr knockdown does not prevent starvation-induced autophagy in the fat body, which is associated with survival. In addition, components of the conserved engulfment pathway are required for clearance of dying salivary glands. To our knowledge, this is the first example of an engulfment factor that is required for self-clearance of cells. Further, Drpr is the first factor that distinguishes autophagy that is associated with cell death from autophagy associated with cell survival."

With prevalent hyperactivation of the mammalian TOR (mTOR) pathway in human cancers, strategies to enhance TOR pathway inhibition are needed. We used a yeast-based screen to identify small-molecule enhancers of rapamycin (SMERs) and discovered an inhibitor (SMER3) of the Skp1-Cullin-F-box (SCF)(Met30) ubiquitin ligase, a member of the SCF E3-ligase family, which regulates diverse cellular processes including transcription, cell-cycle control and immune response. We show here that SMER3 inhibits SCF(Met30) in vivo and in vitro, but not the closely related SCF(Cdc4). Furthermore, we demonstrate that SMER3 diminishes binding of the F-box subunit Met30 to the SCF core complex in vivo and show evidence for SMER3 directly binding to Met30. Our results show that there is no fundamental barrier to obtaining specific inhibitors to modulate function of individual SCF complexes."

We developed a K+-selective ionotropic glutamate receptor that reversibly inhibits neuronal activity in response to light in dissociated neurons and brain slice and also reversibly suppresses behavior in zebrafish. The receptor is a chimera of the pore region of a K+-selective bacterial glutamate receptor and the ligand-binding domain of a light-gated mammalian kainate receptor. This hyperpolarizing light-gated channel, HyLighter, is turned on by a brief light pulse at one wavelength and turned off by a pulse at a second wavelength. The control is obtained at moderate intensity. After optical activation, the photocurrent and optical silencing of activity persists in the dark for extended periods. The low light requirement and bi-stability of HyLighter represent advantages for the dissection of neural circuitry."
https://openalex.org/W2137269516,"Laser cooling and electromagnetic traps have led to a revolution in atomic physics, yielding dramatic discoveries ranging from Bose-Einstein condensation to the quantum control of single atoms. Of particular interest, because they can be used in the quantum control of one atom by another, are excited Rydberg states, where wavefunctions are expanded from their ground-state extents of less than 0.1 nm to several nanometres and even beyond; this allows atoms far enough apart to be non-interacting in their ground states to strongly interact in their excited states. For eventual application of such states, a solid-state implementation is very desirable. Here we demonstrate the coherent control of impurity wavefunctions in the most ubiquitous donor in a semiconductor, namely phosphorus-doped silicon. In our experiments, we use a free-electron laser to stimulate and observe photon echoes, the orbital analogue of the Hahn spin echo, and Rabi oscillations familiar from magnetic resonance spectroscopy. As well as extending atomic physicists' explorations of quantum phenomena to the solid state, our work adds coherent terahertz radiation, as a particularly precise regulator of orbitals in solids, to the list of controls, such as pressure and chemical composition, already familiar to materials scientists."

https://openalex.org/W1993783493,"Lipoprotein lipase (LPL)-mediated lipolysis of triglycerides is the first and rate-limiting step in chylomicron/very low density lipoprotein clearance at the luminal surface of the capillaries. Angiopoietin-like protein 3 (ANGPTL3) is shown to inhibit LPL activity and plays important roles in modulating lipoprotein metabolism in vivo. However, the mechanism by which it inhibits LPL activity remains poorly understood. Using cell-based analysis of the interaction between ANGPTL3, furin, proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 5 (PCSK5), paired amino acid converting enzyme-4 (PACE4), and LPL, we demonstrated that the cleavage of LPL by proprotein convertases is an inactivation process, similar to that seen for endothelial lipase cleavage. At physiological concentrations and in the presence of cells, ANGPTL3 is a potent inhibitor of LPL. This action is due to the fact that ANGPTL3 can enhance LPL cleavage by endogenous furin and PACE4 but not by PCSK5. This effect is specific to LPL but not endothelial lipase. Both N- and C-terminal domains of LPL are required for ANGPTL3-enhanced cleavage, and the N-terminal domain of ANGPTL3 is sufficient to exert its effect on LPL cleavage. Moreover, ANGPTL3 enhances LPL cleavage in the presence of either heparan sulfate proteoglycans or glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored high density lipoprotein-binding protein 1 (GPIHBP1). By enhancing LPL cleavage, ANGPTL3 dissociates LPL from the cell surface, inhibiting both the catalytic and noncatalytic functions of LPL. Taken together, our data provide a molecular connection between ANGPTL3, LPL, and proprotein convertases, which may represent a rapid signal communication among different metabolically active tissues to maintain energy homeostasis.

Antigene RNAs complementary to non-coding transcripts localized to the 3′ termini of genes are now shown to regulate transcription across long genomic sequences. Transcriptome studies reveal many noncoding transcripts overlapping 3′ gene termini. The function of these transcripts is unknown. Here we have characterized transcription at the progesterone receptor (PR) locus and identified noncoding transcripts that overlap the 3′ end of the gene. Small RNAs complementary to sequences beyond the 3′ terminus of PR mRNA modulated expression of PR, recruited argonaute 2 to a 3′ noncoding transcript, altered occupancy of RNA polymerase II, induced chromatin changes at the PR promoter and affected responses to physiological stimuli. We found that the promoter and 3′ terminal regions of the PR locus are in close proximity, providing a potential mechanism for RNA-mediated control of transcription over long genomic distances. These results extend the potential for small RNAs to regulate transcription to target sequences beyond the 3′ termini of mRNA."
https://openalex.org/W2038644613,"Ganglioside GD3 is widely expressed in human malignant melanoma cell lines and tumors. Previously, we reported that GD3+ cells show stronger tyrosine phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK), p130Cas, and paxillin when treated with fetal calf serum than GD3− cells. In this study, we analyzed the changes in the signals mediated by the interaction between integrins and extracellular matrices (ECM) to clarify how GD3 enhances cell signals in the vicinity of the cell membrane. An adhesion assay with a real time cell electronic sensing system revealed that GD3+ cells had stronger adhesion to all extracellular matrices examined. In particular, GD3+ cells attached more strongly to collagen type I and type IV than controls. Correspondingly, they showed stronger tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK and paxillin during adhesion to collagen type I. In the floating pattern of detergent extracts, a high level of integrin β1 was found in glycolipid-enriched microdomain (GEM)/rafts in GD3+ cells before adhesion, whereas a smaller amount of integrin β1 was detected in the GEM/rafts of controls. Some phosphorylated forms of FAK as well as total FAK were found in GEM/rafts during cell adhesion only in GD3+ cells. Another signal consisting of integrin-linked kinase/Akt was also activated during adhesion more strongly in GD3+ cells than in controls. In double stained GD3+ cells, GD3 and integrin β1 co-localized at the focal adhesion with a punctate pattern. All these results suggested that integrins assembled and formed a cluster in GEM/rafts, leading to the enhanced signaling and malignant properties under GD3 expression.

Sialic acid-containing glycosphingolipids, known as gangliosides, are expressed at high levels in nerve tissues and various tumor cells (1Fredman P. Hedberg K. Brezicka T. BioDrugs. 2003; 17: 155-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Although a number of studies on the roles of gangliosides in the regulation of cell proliferation have been performed (2Hakomori S. Igarashi Y. Adv. Lipid Res. 1993; 25: 147-162PubMed Google Scholar), the mechanisms of regulation are not well understood. Malignant melanoma is very difficult to cure because of its rapid growth, high tendency of metastasis, rigorous invasion into surrounding tissues, and resistance to therapy (3Furukawa K. Lloyd K.O.

Among extrinsic signals supporting cellular activity, those derived from the interaction between integrin and the extracellular matrix (ECM) should be just as important as growth factor-derived signals. Molecules involved in biosignaling via growth factors/receptors might also be involved in integrin-mediated signaling (13Ogita H. Takai Y. Int. Rev. Cytol. 2008; 265: 1-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In fact, integrins play essential roles in causing melanomas to acquire malignant properties based on GD3 expression (14Ohkawa Y. Miyazaki S. Miyata M. Hamamura K. Furukawa K. Furukawa K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2008; 373: 14-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 15Wong R.P. Ng P. Dedhar S. Li G. Mol. Cancer Ther. 2007; 6: 1692-1700Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). There are a number of studies indicating that integrin expression is up-regulated during malignant transformation, and integrin-mediated signals consisting of FAK, integrin-linked kinase (ILK), and ERK/MAPK, which determine cell fates such as cell growth and invasion, are activated in melanomas (16Kuphal S. Bauer R. Bosserhoff A.K. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 2005; 24: 195-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). In this study, we examined how GD3 is implicated in increased integrin-mediated adhesion and subsequent signaling, leading to the malignant properties of melanomas.

The cell surface expression of integrin β1 was analyzed by flow cytometry (BD Biosciences) as previously described (17Yoshida S. Fukumoto S. Kawaguchi H. Sato S. Ueda R. Furukawa K. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 4244-4252PubMed Google Scholar). The in vitro invasion and BrdU assays were performed as described previously (14Ohkawa Y. Miyazaki S. Miyata M. Hamamura K. Furukawa K. Furukawa K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2008; 373: 14-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). ECM in PBS (5 μg/ml) was coated in Petri dishes (Greiner Bio-one, Frickenhausen, Germany) or glass base dishes (Iwaki, Tokyo, Japan) overnight at 4 °C. Then, plates were washed twice with PBS and blocked with serum-free minimal essential medium containing 1% heat-inactivated BSA (10 min at 60 °C). Plates coated with 0.01% PLL (Sigma) in Petri dishes for 5 min at room temperature were washed with PBS and blocked with minimal essential medium/BSA as previously described (18Toledo M.S. Suzuki E. Handa K. Hakomori S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 16227-16234Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). ACEA e-plates (ACEA Biosciences, San Diego, CA) were coated with FN, LN, CL type I, CL type IV, or PLL for 1 h at 37 °C. The plates were washed with PBS and coated with 0.5% BSA in PBS for 20 min at 37 °C. The wells were washed with PBS before the addition of culture medium with or without serum, and cells (1 × 104) were added on ACEA e-plates coated with various ECM proteins. The adhesion of cells was monitored continuously using the RT-CES system (Wako Pure Chemical, Osaka, Japan) for 24 h. Cells were starved for 14–16 h in serum-free DMEM, and harvested with trypsin/EDTA in PBS or 0.02% EDTA in PBS. Trypsin activity was inhibited by adding 100 μg/ml of soybean trypsin inhibitor (Invitrogen) to PBS. To reduce basal phosphorylation of signaling molecules, cells were rotated for 1 h at 37 °C. Cell suspensions (4 × 105) were added to 6-cm dishes precoated with CL type I or CL type IV. Cells were lysed after incubation at 37 °C, and lysates were used for Western immunoblotting. Cells were lysed with cell lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm Na2EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 2.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 μg/ml of leupeptin) (Cell Signaling), Protease Inhibitor MixtureTM (Calbiochem, San Diego, CA), and 1 mm PMSF. Insoluble materials were removed by centrifugation at 4 °C at 10,000 × g for 10 min. Cell lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE using 10–15% gels. The separated proteins were transferred onto an Immunobilon-PTM membrane (Millipore, Billerica, MA). Blots were blocked with BSA in PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20. The membrane was first probed with primary antibodies. After being washed, the blots were incubated with goat anti-rabbit IgGs or goat anti-mouse IgGs conjugated with HRP (1:1000). Bound conjugates on the membrane were visualized with an Enhanced ChemiluminescenceTM detection system (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Cells (2–2.5 × 107) were lysed with cell lysis buffer, i.e. 1% Lubrol WX (SERVA, Heidelberg, Germany) in MNE buffer (25 mm MES, pH 6.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm PMSF, 1 μg/μl of aprotinin). After removing insoluble material by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min, lysates were dounced 10 times with a Digital HomogenizerTM (AS ONE, Osaka, Japan). The lysates were mixed with an equal volume of 80% sucrose in MNE buffer, and a stepwise gradient was prepared by overlaying 30% sucrose in MNE followed by a final layer of 5% sucrose in MNE. The gradient was formed by centrifugation for 16–18 h at 4 °C at 200,000 × g using a Beckman MLS50 rotor (Kent, MI). Fractions of 500 μl were separated from the top of the gradient, and were used for Western immunoblotting. Approximately 500 μl of cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with rabbit anti-FAK antibodies (0.2 μg), rabbit anti-ILK antibodies, or normal rabbit IgGs bound to protein A-Sepharose beads at 4 °C for 8 h. The beads were washed three times with a washing buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, 1 mm Na3VO4) and finally resuspended in 40 μl of 2× SDS sample buffer. The precipitated proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and then analyzed by immunoblotting with mouse anti-FAK antibodies, an anti-phosphotyrosine mAb (PY20), anti-phosphothreonine antibodies, anti-phosphoserine antibodies, or anti-ILK antibodies. Suppression of ILK after 48 h of transfection into GD3+ cell (G5) with 4 kinds of siRNA was examined by immunoblotting using an anti-ILK antibody (BD Biosciences). GL2, siRNA for a firefly luciferase (B-Bridge International, Inc. CA) was used as a negative control. si-ILK3 (5′-AAGUUAAGCUGUUUGAAGUCAAUGC-3′) (Invitrogen) was the most effective (knockdown rate was about 70%). Cells were fixed in paraformaldehyde (4% in PBS for 10 min) and then incubated with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min at room temperature. After being washed with PBS, nonspecific binding was blocked with 2.5% BSA in PBS for 60 min at room temperature. Cells were incubated with biotin-conjugated anti-human CD29 (integrin β1) or mAb R24 in PBS containing 0.5% BSA for 60 min at room temperature, then with phycoerythrin-streptavidin or protein A-FITC in PBS containing 0.5% BSA for 30–45 min at room temperature. The resulting staining patterns were imaged using a confocal microscope (Fluoview FV500, Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). Expression of GD3 on established GD3+ cells (G5) and control cells (V4) was shown in Fig. 1A. Other transfectant cells showed essentially the same pattern as G5. Integrin β1 levels in cell lysates prepared from GD3+ cells and control cells were analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-integrin β1, showing an almost equivalent intensity of bands among all GD3+ cells and control cells (Fig. 1B). Expression of integrins on GD3+ cells (G5, G11) and control cells (V4, V9) was analyzed by flow cytometry using anti-integrin antibodies (α2β1, α3, α4β1, and α5β1) (see Fig. 1C for data on G5 and V4). There were no differences in the expression levels of any integrins between GD3+ cell lines and the controls examined. Expression levels of integrins α2β1 and α3β1 were higher than those of integrins α4β1 and α5β1 in all cell lines. As shown in Fig. 1, D and E, knockdown of integrin β1 with siRNA ITG1 resulted in reduced protein levels (Fig. 1D) and reduced surface expression (Fig. 1E). Then, it was shown that knockdown of integrin β1 resulted in suppressed cell growth and invasion activity, especially in the GD3+ transfectant cells (Fig. 1F). These results were essentially the same as those reported in a previous study (14Ohkawa Y. Miyazaki S. Miyata M. Hamamura K. Furukawa K. Furukawa K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2008; 373: 14-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The intensity of adhesion and spreading of GD3+ cells and control cells was analyzed by the RT-CES system (Fig. 2). This system allowed us to observe cell adhesion activity in real time. ACEA e-plates were coated with LN, CL type I, CL type IV, FN, or PLL as a control. GD3+ cells (G5 and G11) adhered to LN, CL type I, CL type IV, or FN more strongly than control cells (V4 and V9) in the presence of FCS (left). Similarly, GD3+ cells showed more intense adhesion to LN, CL type I, CL type IV, or FN than control cells under FCS-free conditions (right), although the adhesion activity of these cells was generally lower under FCS-free conditions than in the presence of FCS. For PLL, the adhesion intensity was very low and did not increase in the latter phase in either GD3+ or control cells. To investigate integrin signaling triggered by cell adhesion to ECM, we analyzed tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK in GD3+ and control cells because FAK has been implicated in integrin-mediated signaling. After serum starvation and rotation, cells were plated on dishes pre-coated with CL type I or CL type IV under serum-free conditions, and incubated at 37 °C for 0, 15, or 60 min (Fig. 3A). After incubation, cells were lysed and the lysates were used for immunoprecipitation using an anti-FAK antibody and subsequent immunoblotting using PY20 or an anti-FAK antibody. As shown in Fig. 3, A and B, the phosphorylation levels of FAK in GD3+ cells were higher than those of control cells during adhesion to CL type I for 15 or 60 min incubation. Immunoblotting with phosphorylation site-specific antibodies revealed that phosphorylation levels were generally higher in GD3+ cells than in control cells. In particular, Tyr-577, Tyr-861, and Tyr-925 showed stronger phosphorylation in GD3+ cells than in control cells (Fig. 3, C and D, left). When the same experiment was performed for CL type IV, the phosphorylation levels of Tyr-577 and Tyr-861 were much lower with no definite differences between either type of cell (Fig. 3, C and D, right). These results suggested that integrin-mediated signaling is enhanced with GD3 expression during adhesion to CL type I. We analyzed phosphorylation of p130Cas and paxillin during adhesion to CL type I or CL type IV (Fig. 4). The phosphorylation of p130Cas and paxillin was detected by immunoblotting with phosphorylation site-specific antibodies of p130Cas (p-p130Cas 165, 249, and 410) or paxillin (p-paxillin 31, 118, and 181) as well as anti-p130Cas and anti-paxillin antibodies. GD3+ cells (G5) showed stronger phosphorylation of paxillin than the control cells (V4) during adhesion to CL type I as shown for FAK (Fig. 4, C and D). Notably, the strongest levels of phosphorylation of paxillin (p-paxillin 31 and 118) were observed in GD3+ cells at 30 min incubation. On the other hand, no differences in the phosphorylation of p130Cas were found between GD3+ cells and GD3− cells in any sites of p130Cas (Fig. 4, A and B). These results suggested that signaling via integrin and its downstream was differentially enhanced for paxillin, not for p130Cas with GD3 expression in melanomas. As for adhesion to CL type IV, phosphorylation levels of these molecules were much lower at all time points in both types of cells (Fig. 4, A and C, right, and B and D, lower). These results suggested that phosphorylation of Tyr-577 and Tyr-861 in FAK is important for subsequent activation of paxillin, leading to malignant phenotypes under GD3 expression. We examined the mechanisms with which integrin-mediated signaling is enhanced by GD3 expression. The assembly of integrins in GEM/rafts under GD3 expression might be a possible mechanism. We therefore separated fractions from GD3+ (G5) or control cells (V4) during adhesion to CL type I using sucrose density gradient ultracentrifugation, and immunoblotting with anti-integrin β1 antibodies was performed using the fractions (Fig. 5A). Caveolin-1 was used as a GEM/raft marker. In these experiments, the majority of GD3 existed in GEM/raft fractions at all time points in GD3+ cells. Fundamental data to confirm GD3 bands in immunoblotting were shown under supplemental Fig. S1. It is noteworthy that a significant amount of integrin β1 was already present in GEM/raft fractions in GD3+ cells at approximately three times or more of that of control cells before incubation (time 0). The majority of integrins moved to the GEM/raft fractions in both GD3+ cells and control cells upon a 15-min incubation with CL type I. This result indicated that integrins in GEM/rafts are involved in cell adhesion, and that integrin-mediated signaling is generated there. After incubation for 60 min, only low levels of integrins remained in the GEM/rafts in both GD3+ and control cells, which were almost equivalent to the level of control cells at time 0 (Fig. 5B). We analyzed floating patterns of FAK, p130Cas, and paxillin, and their phosphorylated forms during cell adhesion in GD3+ transfectant cells (G5) and control cells (V4). The amounts of total FAK detected in the GEM/raft fractions were fairly high in both types of cells before and after 15 min of adhesion reaction (supplemental Fig. S2). Phosphorylated FAK bands were detected in the GEM/raft fractions at 15 min incubation only in GD3+ cells. A strong tyrosine phosphorylation band at Tyr-925 of FAK, and weak bands at Tyr-576 and Tyr-577, were found in the GEM/rafts at 15 min in GD3+ cells. These phosphorylation bands were not found in the GEM/raft fractions at 60 min incubation in either type of cells. The results in supplemental Fig. S2 were summarized in the graph of Fig. 5C. In addition, we examined the floating patterns of FAK during adhesion in the presence of FCS. As shown in supplemental Fig. S2B, bands of total FAK and phosphorylated FAK in GEM/rafts were more definite and more intense than those in the mere adhesion experiments (supplemental Fig. S2, A and B). These results were also summarized in Fig. 5C. As for p130Cas and paxillin, paxillin underwent stronger phosphorylation in GD3+ cells during cell adhesion as shown in Fig. 4, whereas the majority of those proteins were persistently found in non-GEM/raft fractions (supplemental Fig. S3). Phosphorylation bands of p130Cas and paxillin were also absent in the GEM/raft fractions at all stages in both types of cells (G5 and V4). In addition to FAK and paxillin, the ILK-Akt signaling pathway was also enhanced during cell adhesion to CL type I in GD3+ cells. Both pAkt (Ser-473) and pAkt (Thr-308) were more strongly activated in GD3+ cells at 10 min of incubation with CL type I (Fig. 6, A and B). To examine the involvement of ILK in Akt activation, siRNA:si-ILK3 was used for its highest efficiency (∼80%) in knockdown of ILK (Fig. 6C). In GD3+ cells treated with si-ILK3, stronger suppression in band intensities of p-Akt (Ser-473) and p-Akt (Thr-308) was observed at 20 min after cell adhesion to CL type I than in GD3− cells (Fig. 6D). Using fractions by sucrose density gradient fractionation, floating patterns of ILK were examined (supplemental Fig. S4). It was detected only in non-GEM/rafts. Phosphorylation at Ser/Thr of ILK was also examined, showing low levels of phosphorylation regardless of incubation intervals. To examine activation of ERK during cell adhesion, immunoblotting of ERKs was performed. Consequently, no definite increase in phosphorylation levels of ERKs was found in cells after vigorous washing of FCS. Furthermore, no bands of p-ERK were found in GEM/rafts (supplemental Fig. S5, A–C). Interestingly, stronger phosphorylation reaction of ERKs could be found in GD3+ cells when adhesion was performed in the presence of the remaining FCS (supplemental Fig. S5D). We analyzed the intracellular localization of integrin β1 and GD3 by double immunofluorescence staining. Cells (G5) were plated on pre-coated plates with CL type I, and fixed after incubation for 0, 3, 7, 10, 18, and 30 min. The intracellular localization of integrin β1 and GD3 at various stages of adhesion is shown in Fig. 7A. Evidence to confirm definite the remaining levels of GD3 in Triton X-100-treated cells were shown under supplemental Fig. S6. Although integrin β1 and GD3 were uniformly merged on the cell membrane at time 0 (14Ohkawa Y. Miyazaki S. Miyata M. Hamamura K. Furukawa K. Furukawa K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2008; 373: 14-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), integrin β1 was detected at the peripheral regions of cells at the early stage of adhesion (7 min). Then, GD3 appeared at the central area of the cells and colocalized with integrin β1 (10 min). They co-localized with a punctate pattern at cell adhesion spots until around 30 min incubation. Furthermore, scanned images in Fig. 7B show integrins located at the cell attachment sites on the matrix first, and GD3 coming down to the focal adhesion sites following the integrins, leading to colocalization until about 30 min. GD3 is highly and specifically expressed in melanomas, and has therefore been used as a target for immune therapy (6Houghton A.N. Mintzer D. Cordon-Cardo C. Welt S. Fliegel B. Vadhan S. Carswell E.

To investigate the roles of GD3, we have established a set of melanoma cell lines with or without GD3 expression using a GD3-deficient mutant, N1, which was generated by treatment of SK-MEL-28 with an anti-GD3 mAb and complement (9Nakano J. Raj B.K. Asagami C. Lloyd K.O. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1996; 107: 543-548Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Re-expression of GD3 with GD3 synthase cDNA resulted in the establishment of cell lines that enabled us to identify the phenotypic changes due to GD3 expression, and to investigate the molecular mechanisms of the enhanced malignant properties under GD3 expression (11Hamamura K.

Because stronger phosphorylation of FAK, p130Cas, and paxillin in GD3+ cells after treatment with FCS has been observed (12Hamamura K. Tsuji M. Ohkawa Y. Nakashima H. Miyazaki S. Urano T. Yamamoto N.

In this study, we tried to elucidate whether GD3 is implicated in integrin-mediated cell adhesion using the transfectant cells of GD3 synthase cDNA. Integrins are cell surface receptors consisting of two subunits, α and β. Immunoblotting and flow cytometry revealed that the expression levels of integrins examined were almost equivalent between GD3+ cells and negative controls (Fig. 1, B and C), whereas they were very low or undetectable in the GD3-positive parent SK-MEL-28 cells (9Nakano J.

https://openalex.org/W2060616543,"Hyperactivation of phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K) can occur as a result of somatic mutations in PIK3CA, the gene encoding the p110α subunit of PI3K. The HER2 oncogene is amplified in 25% of all breast cancers and some of these tumors also harbor PIK3CA mutations. We examined mechanisms by which mutant PI3K can enhance transformation and confer resistance to HER2-directed therapies. We introduced the PI3K mutations E545K and H1047R in MCF10A human mammary epithelial cells that also overexpress HER2. Both mutants conferred a gain of function to MCF10A/HER2 cells. Expression of H1047R PI3K, but not E545K PI3K, markedly upregulated the HER3/HER4 ligand heregulin (HRG). HRG siRNA inhibited growth of H1047R but not E545K-expressing cells and synergized with the HER2 inhibitors trastuzumab and lapatinib. The PI3K inhibitor BEZ235 markedly inhibited HRG and pAKT levels and, in combination with lapatinib, completely inhibited growth of cells expressing H1047R PI3K. These observations suggest that PI3K mutants enhance HER2-mediated transformation by amplifying the ligand-induced signaling output of the ErbB network. This also counteracts the full effect of therapeutic inhibitors of HER2. These data also suggest that mammary tumors that contain both HER2 gene amplification and PIK3CA mutations should be treated with a combination of HER2 and PI3K inhibitors."

https://openalex.org/W2024035073,"Building on their previous observation that neuronal calcium spike activity can drive neurotransmitter specification during development, these authors report that cJun phosphorylation integrates activity-dependent and intrinsic transmitter specification through the regulation of tlx3 transcription in Xenopus sensory neurons. Neuronal differentiation is accomplished through cascades of intrinsic genetic factors initiated in neuronal progenitors by external gradients of morphogens. Activity has been thought to be important only late in development, but recent evidence suggests that activity also regulates early neuronal differentiation. Activity in post-mitotic neurons before synapse formation can regulate phenotypic specification, including neurotransmitter choice, but the mechanisms are not clear. We identified a mechanism that links endogenous calcium spike activity with an intrinsic genetic pathway to specify neurotransmitter choice in neurons in the dorsal embryonic spinal cord of Xenopus tropicalis. Early activity modulated transcription of the GABAergic/glutamatergic selection gene tlx3 through a variant cAMP response element (CRE) in its promoter. The cJun transcription factor bound to this CRE site, modulated transcription and regulated neurotransmitter phenotype via its transactivation domain. Calcium signaled through cJun N-terminal phosphorylation, which integrated activity-dependent and intrinsic neurotransmitter specification. This mechanism provides a basis for early activity to regulate genetic pathways at critical decision points, switching the phenotype of developing neurons."
https://openalex.org/W2099944032,"Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells circulating in peripheral blood (PB) differ from the leukemic fraction in lymph nodes (LNs) with respect to cell division and drug sensitivity. CD40 stimulation of PB CLL cells in vitro results in chemoresistance and provides a partial model for the LN microenvironment. The TLR9 ligand CpG induces proliferation in immunoglobulin variable heavy-chain-unmutated CLL, but apoptosis in immunoglobulin variable heavy-chain-mutated CLL. To juxtapose proliferative with antiapoptotic signals, we investigated the effects of CpG in the context of CD40 ligation in mutated versus unmutated CLL cells in this study. Prolonged CD40 ligation induced classical, followed by alternative nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB), activity in both subgroups, correlating with enhanced Bfl-1 and Bcl-XL levels, respectively. A dichotomy in NF-κB signaling occurred on combined CD40/TLR9 triggering. This induced declining p52 and Bcl-XL levels, and reversed chemoresistance only in mutated cells, whereas unmutated cells proliferated, maintained p52 and Bcl-XL and remained chemoresistant. The pivotal contribution of Bcl-XL to chemoresistance was shown by the BH3 mimetic ABT-737 and RNA interference. Finally, in ex vivo LN samples, p52, p65 and Bcl-XL levels were highly expressed, corroborating the in vitro findings. Thus, a distinction in NF-κB activation and drug susceptibility in mutated versus unmutated (LN-like) CLL cells was uncovered, which was causally linked to Bcl-XL levels."

Analyses were performed using gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (GC/MS), two-dimensional gas chromatography combined with time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GCxGC-TOFMS), lipid and starch analysis, and enzymatic determination of fermentative products. The studies were designed to provide a detailed metabolite profile of the solar Bio-H2 production process. This work reports on the differential analysis of metabolic profiles of the high H2-producing strain Stm6Glc4 and the wild-type cc406 (WT) before and during the H2 production phase. Using GCxGC-TOFMS analysis the number of detected peaks increased from 128 peaks, previously detected by GC/MS techniques, to ∼1168. More detailed analysis of the anaerobic H2 production phase revealed remarkable differences between wild-type and mutant cells in a number of metabolic pathways. Under these physiological conditions the WT produced up to 2.6 times more fatty acids, 2.2 times more neutral lipids, and up to 4 times more fermentation products compared with Stm6Glc4.

IntroductionRenewable, CO2-free energy is increasingly important due to concerns over fuel security and the increase in atmospheric CO2 concentration. Plants and cyanobacteria use oxygenic photosynthesis to convert sunlight and water into oxygen and chemical energy. A specific group of green microalgae and cyanobacteria, including the microalga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, have evolved the additional ability to use sunlight for the production of molecular H2 (1Melis A.

The process of H2 production has been described in detail for C. reinhardtii. Under anaerobic conditions two oxygen-sensitive FeFe-hydrogenases (HydA1 and HydA2) are induced (6Forestier M. King P.

There are two possible sources of electron supply: light energy is needed to generate protons and electrons from the water-splitting reaction (7Melis A.

In both cases the reduced ferredoxin serves as electron donor for the FeFe-hydrogenases. Anaerobic culture conditions, required for H2 production, can be achieved by bubbling inert gases through the culture or by sulfur depletion of the culture medium. During sulfur depletion the oxygen in the culture is consumed, and H2 production can be observed (8Melis A. Zhang L. Forestier M. Ghirardi M.L. Seibert M.

The aim of all of these systematic approaches was to understand the regulatory mechanisms of substrate supply to hydrogenase and to identify bottlenecks of the H2 production process as a precondition for subsequent targeted metabolic engineering approaches.In particular metabolomics represents an important component of systems biology research. Currently, metabolome analyses are still limited by the number of unequivocally identified compounds, by difficulties in their exact quantification and limited information on the fluxes of intermediates. However, the advanced analysis of complex metabolite mixtures, termed metabolite profiling, has been made possible through recent advances in modern technologies consisting of metabolite separation techniques and high resolution detection systems (28Fiehn O. Kopka J. Dörmann P. Altmann T. Trethewey R.N. Willmitzer L. Nat. Biotechnol. 2000; 18: 1157-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (1716) Google Scholar). Advanced metabolite profiling now opens up the possibility to follow the physiological adaptation from the aerobic to the anaerobic H2-producing lifestyle of C. reinhardtii.This article reports on the differential analysis of metabolite profiles between Stm6Glc4, the newest and most advanced generation of our high H2-producing C. reinhardtii strains (18Doebbe A. Rupprecht J. Beckmann J. Mussgnug J.H. Hallmann A. Hankamer B. Kruse O. J. Biotechnol. 2007; 131: 27-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), and the corresponding WT cc406 before and during H2 production using two-dimensional GC coupled with time of flight MS (GCxGC-TOFMS), which has resolved an order of magnitude more compounds than previously reported (29Welthagen W. Shellie R.A. Spranger J. Ristow M. Zimmermann R. Fiehn O. Metabolomics. 2005; 1DOI: 10.1007/s11306-005-1108-2Crossref Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Stm6Glc4 is a cell line developed by inserting a hexose symporter into the high H2-producing mutant Stm6. It therefore couples regular photosynthetic H2 production with the ability to convert glucose into H2.DISCUSSIONThe aim of this work was to intensively characterize the metabolic profiles of C. reinhardtii WT (cc406) and the high H2-producing mutant strain (Stm6Glc4) during defined stages of the H2 production process to identify potential key components that are crucial for efficient hydrogenase activity. A better understanding of the metabolic adaptation and especially of the differences between WT cells and high H2-producing strains could help to improve H2 production in C. reinhardtii. The direct parental strain of mutant Stm6 (and derivates), cc1618, shows an arginine auxotrophy, and for this reason could not be used for the comparative physiological studies. We therefore used strain cc406 as the WT control strain, which has a similar genetic background to that of Stm6 (i.e. strain cc124 with a cell wall deficiency “cw15” phenotype) for our experiments. It should be noted that the H2 production kinetics of the WT control and strain Stm6Glc4 differ significantly in that the WT reaches anaerobiosis and subsequent H2 production 40 h later than the mutant (Fig. 1, time point c). These kinetic differences made it necessary to determine time points c, d, and e individually for each strain. Although these time points should reflect comparable physiological states in terms of H2 production, we cannot exclude the possibility that the differences of the incubation period could have had some additional, unknown effects on the cells.Metabolic compound levels were monitored with standard GC/MS techniques and with the newly developed high resolution GCxGC-TOFMS (29Welthagen W. Shellie R.A. Spranger J. Ristow M. Zimmermann R. Fiehn O. Metabolomics. 2005; 1DOI: 10.1007/s11306-005-1108-2Crossref Scopus (139) Google Scholar) technique. Recently the metabolome of Stm6, the first generation of high H2 production mutants (9Kruse O. Rupprecht J. Bader K.P. Thomas-Hall S. Schenk P.M. Finazzi G. Hankamer B. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 34170-34177Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar), was characterized at lower resolution via GC/MS and by NMR studies (27Timmins M. Zhou W. Rupprecht J. Lim L. Thomas-Hall S.R. Doebbe A. Kruse O. Hankamer B. Marx U.C. Smith S.M. Schenk P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 23415-23425Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). By applying GCxGC-TOFMS in our improved experimental setup, the quality of the analysis is taken to the next level because chromatographic peak detection is increased by ∼10-fold.Two-dimensional GCxGC-TOFMS Analysis during H2 Production Revealed a Variety of Metabolic ChangesThe improved approach used to analyze the cellular metabolome is based on two-dimensional GC coupled with time-of-flight MS (GCxGC-TOFMS) and increases the amount of detectable peaks dramatically (29Welthagen W. Shellie R.A. Spranger J. Ristow M. Zimmermann R. Fiehn O. Metabolomics. 2005; 1DOI: 10.1007/s11306-005-1108-2Crossref Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The combined GCxGC-TOFMS and GC/MS data of our study generally were in good agreement with results obtained previously (27Timmins M. Zhou W. Rupprecht J. Lim L. Thomas-Hall S.R. Doebbe A. Kruse O. Hankamer B. Marx U.C. Smith S.M. Schenk P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 23415-23425Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). However, as a consequence of the improved separation of substances, which co-elute in conventional GC, the two-dimensional GCxGC-TOFMS allowed us to detect nearly ten times as many metabolic peaks. Therefore a number of new compounds were found, which had not been described before, generating a much more detailed metabolic map of the H2 production process. By applying GCxGC-TOFMS we were for the first time able to identify ribose, a compound derived exclusively from the pentose phosphate pathway, and obtained more detailed information on the terpenoids and steroids metabolism and of many amino acids, organic acids, and compounds of membrane synthesis. It has to be mentioned that, up to now, no fully automated annotation program has been available for GCxGC-TOFMS, making the processing of massive amounts of data generated by this new method rather time-consuming. Nevertheless, the “statistical compare” feature of the LECO ChromaTOF® software affords a good possibility of analyzing these data.The combination of GC/MS, GCxGC-TOFMS, enzymatic determination of fermentation products, starch, and the analyses of neutral lipids revealed a variety of metabolic changes in the green algal cells during sulfur-induced H2 production. A general trend observed was that, during the H2 production process, intermediates of the citric acid cycle/glyoxylate cycle decreased, whereas the levels of intermediates of the glycolysis, amino acids, fermentative products, fatty acids, and lipids increased. Metabolic processes like steroid, terpenoid, and isopropenoid synthesis were reduced during H2 production, as were most of the pathways for nucleoside and nucleobase synthesis. These results confirm that, under anaerobic H2-producing conditions, only a selected number of metabolic processes are maintained to ensure survival of the organism.Several switches within the intracellular metabolism are observed when cells are transferred into sulfur-depleted conditions, including a sharp decline of Rubisco protein levels during the first 24 h, which results in an inhibition of CO2 fixation (7Melis A. Planta. 2007; 226: 1075-1086Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Under these conditions, acetate from the medium is consumed (Fig. 6) and starch accumulates (27Timmins M. Zhou W.

As a consequence the intermediates of the glycolysis pathway increased (Fig. 3A). It has been reported previously that metabolite levels of fermentative products and transcript levels of genes of fermentative pathways increase during anaerobic cultivation in the dark (21Mus F. Dubini A. Seibert M. Posewitz M.C. Grossman A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 25475-25486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Recent metabolome studies have demonstrated that these fermentative compounds are also produced during photobiological H2 production in the light (27Timmins M. Zhou W. Rupprecht J. Lim L.

Our data confirm these results, because formate and ethanol levels were increased under these conditions (Fig. 6). Detailed microarray studies during sulfur depletion also demonstrated the increase of transcript levels of genes associated with the fermentative and the starch metabolism (26Nguyen A.V.

Our metabolic studies revealed that compared with Stm6Glc4, the WT surprisingly accumulated less starch in the early sulfur depletion phase but metabolized more accumulated starch during the peak H2 production phase. The fact that apparently more starch was consumed in the WT, but at the same time less H2 was produced compared with Stm6Glc4, clearly indicates that starch degradation can be replaced by external glucose feeding. Stm6Glc4 has the ability of limited glucose uptake from the medium and glucose is needed for producing pyruvate as a key intermediate product via glycolysis.During aerobic growth, pyruvate is used for many biosynthesis pathways, as illustrated in Fig. 11. When the culture is subjected to sulfur limitation but still aerobic, starch, fatty acid, and lipid synthesis are strongly induced. In contrast when anaerobic conditions are established, it seems that pyruvate is mainly used for amino acid synthesis and fermentative pathways to control the cellular redox balance (21Mus F.

Goodenough U. Eukaryot. Cell. 2009; 8: 1856-1868Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar) (FIGURE 2, FIGURE 3, FIGURE 4, FIGURE 5, FIGURE 6). We conclude from our data that, during anaerobic conditions, accumulated starch and phosphorylated sugars are preferentially catabolized via the glycolysis pathway and not via the pentose phosphate pathway, because the detected compound of the latter decreased significantly. This conclusion is confirmed by the fact that the intermediates of the glycolysis pathway showed a strong increase during the H2 production process, during which accumulated starch reserves were consumed. During glycolytic starch breakdown, NAD(P)+ is reduced to NAD(P)H + H+, which can then serve as the electron source for H2 production, because it can be used to reduce the PQ-pool, catalyzed by the NAD(P)H dehydrogenase (NDH, Fig. 11). Pyruvate, generated by glycolysis, is then used for fermentation (Fig. 6), and/or for amino acid biosynthesis, especially alanine (Fig. 2B).Alanine is synthesized by transamination of pyruvate with glutamate being the amino donor, a process catalyzed by the alanine aminotransferase (43Vallon H. Spalding M.H. Stern D.B. Harris E.H. The Chlamydomonas Sourcebook, Organellar and Metabolic Processes. 2nd Ed. 2. Academic Press, San Diego, CA2009: 115-158Google Scholar). In both strains, increased levels of alanine were monitored already during the first hours of sulfur depletion. However, a clear difference between WT and mutant could be detected during the H2 production phase with only Stm6Glc4 exhibiting continuously increasing levels of alanine (see Fig. 2B). Glutamate is used as the amino donor for amino acid synthesis and is in turn converted into α-ketoglutarate, releasing ammonium. To prevent loss of the ammonium and for regeneration of glutamate, two ferredoxins are thought to be oxidized, controlling the redox balance of the glycolysis under anaerobic conditions. This process can also be interpreted as a direct competition for hydrogenases activity (25Posewitz M.C. Dubini A. Meuser J.E. Seibert M. Ghirardi M.L. Stern D.B. Harris E.H. The Chlamydomonas Sourcebook. Organellar and Metabolic Processes. 2nd Ed. 2. Academic Press, San Diego, CA2009: 217-256Google Scholar).Pyruvate can also be fermented to formate (catalyzed by the pyruvate formate lyase), converted to acetyl-CoA (catalyzed by the pyruvate ferredoxin oxidoreductase), or metabolized to acetate or ethanol (catalyzed by the acetate kinase), or the acetaldehyde dehydrogenase/alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) (21Mus F.

Posewitz M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 7201-7213Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) (Fig. 11). Pyruvate ferredoxin oxidoreductase reduces ferredoxin, which can potentially serve as the electron donor for the hydrogenases (24Dubini A. Mus F. Seibert M. Grossman A.R. Posewitz M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 7201-7213Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Our results confirmed that formate and ethanol started to be produced as soon as anaerobiosis was established in both strains, and the levels kept increasing when H2 production set in (see Fig. 6). The amount of fermentative products was clearly higher in WT than in Stm6Glc4 (1.6–4.2 times more). In contrast, no net acetate production could be observed during anaerobiosis and H2 production. A sharp decrease of the total amount of acetate in the sulfur-depleted medium was detected after cells were transferred, but the levels remained constant during anaerobiosis. These data suggest that, during the first hours of sulfur depletion, the acetate from the medium is taken up by the cells and converted into acetyl-CoA (51Spalding M.H. Stern D.B. Harris E.H. The Chlamydomonas Sourcebook, Organellar and Metabolic Processes. 2nd Ed. 2. Academic Press, San Diego, CA2009: 257-301Google Scholar), which is subsequently metabolized via the citric acid cycle and/or the glyoxylate cycle. However, when oxygen is consumed and anaerobiosis sets in, acetate does not seem to be incorporated anymore (see Fig. 6). In the past a major point of discussion has been whether acetate acts as a direct substrate for H2 production (8Melis A. Zhang L. Forestier M. Ghirardi M.L. Seibert M. Plant Physiol. 2000; 122: 127-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (869) Google Scholar, 25Posewitz M.C. Dubini A. Meuser J.E. Seibert M. Ghirardi M.L. Stern D.B. Harris E.H. The Chlamydomonas Sourcebook.

Biochem. 1994; 222: 769-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Our results show that acetate is consumed only during the initial, aerobic phase and that it appears necessary for an efficient transition into the anaerobic, H2 production phase. After this transition, acetate levels remained unchanged suggesting that acetate does not serve as a direct substrate for H2 production. Acetate consumption from the medium and starch accumulation within the cells coincides. A possible explanation is that acetate is first converted into acetyl-CoA after cellular uptake, which has been shown to preferentially be metabolized via the glyoxylate cycle (51Spalding M.H. Stern D.B. Harris E.H. The Chlamydomonas Sourcebook, Organellar and Metabolic Processes. 2nd Ed. 2. Academic Press, San Diego, CA2009: 257-301Google Scholar), generating succinate as a product. Subsequently, succinate can be converted into malate and oxaloacetate. Oxaloacetate is converted into phosphoenolpyruvate and then into sugar phosphates, which are the basis for starch synthesis (51Spalding M.H. Stern D.B. Harris E.H. The Chlamydomonas Sourcebook, Organellar and Metabolic Processes. 2nd Ed. 2. Academic Press, San Diego, CA2009: 257-301Google Scholar).Some of the acetyl-CoA is also likely to be fed into the citric acid cycle, where it can be used for energy production and to generate carbon skeletons. Finally, the observed accumulation of fatty acids and lipid (FIGURE 4, FIGURE 5) in the plastid, which is a well reported cellular reaction during environmental stress conditions (46Wang Z.T. Ullrich N. Joo S. Waffenschmidt S. Goodenough U. Eukaryot. Cell. 2009; 8: 1856-1868Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar), could also be mediated by acetate uptake with acetyl-CoA being the initial building unit.The accumulation of starch and the production of fatty acids was observed during the first hours of sulfur depletion and strongly increased until anaerobiosis was reached. Of particular note was that the WT showed a much higher tendency to accumulate fatty acids and neutral lipids during H2 production process compared with Stm6Glc4. In contrast, mutant Stm6Glc4 has the tendency to build up relatively more starch then the WT.This study and an earlier study of Wang and co-workers (46Wang Z.T. Ullrich N. Joo S. Waffenschmidt S.

Elevated frequencies of CA in most benign breast lesions and primary tumors suggest a causative role for CA in breast cancers. Clearly, identifying which and how altered signal transduction pathways contribute to CA is crucial to breast cancer control. Although a causative and cooperative role for c-Myc and Ras in mammary tumorigenesis is well documented, their ability to generate CA during mammary tumor initiation remains unexplored. To answer that question, K-Ras(G12D) and c-Myc were induced in mouse mammary glands. Although CA was observed in mammary tumors initiated by c-Myc or K-Ras(G12D), it was detected only in premalignant mammary lesions expressing K-Ras(G12D). CA, both in vivo and in vitro, was associated with increased expression of the centrosome-regulatory proteins, cyclin D1 and Nek2. Abolishing the expression of cyclin D1, Cdk4 or Nek2 in MCF10A human mammary epithelial cells expressing H-Ras(G12V) abrogated Ras-induced CA, whereas silencing cyclin E1 or B2 had no effect. Thus, we conclude that CA precedes mammary tumorigenesis, and interfering with centrosome-regulatory targets suppresses CA."

However, the underlying cellular mechanisms by which TA exerts its effects are only partially understood. Activating transcription factor 3 (ATF3) is a member of the ATF/CREB subfamily of the basic region-leucine zipper family and has been known as a tumor suppressor in human colorectal cancer cells. The present study was performed to observe whether ATF3 mediates TA-induced apoptosis and to elucidate the molecular mechanism of ATF3 transcription induced by TA. TA treatment and ectopic expression of ATF3 increased apoptosis, whereas knockdown of ATF3 resulted in significant repression of TA-activated apoptosis. The TA treatment also induced ATF3 promoter activity. Internal deletion and point mutation of the predicted ATF/C/EBP binding site in ATF3 promoter abolished luciferase activation by TA. Overexpression of ATF2 resulted in significant increase in ATF3 promoter activity, and electrophoretic mobility shift assay identified this region as a core sequence to which ATF2 binds. TA treatment resulted in an increase in ATF2 phosphorylation, which was followed by a subsequent increase in ATF3 transcription. Knock down of ATF2 abolished TA-induced ATF3 expression. We further provide evidence that TA leads to increases in phospho-p38 MAPK, JNK and ERK levels. Inhibition of these pathways using selective inhibitors and dominant negative constructs ameliorated TA-induced ATF3 expression and promoter activities. The current study shows that TA stimulates ATF3 expression and subsequently induces apoptosis. These pathways are mediated through phosphorylation of ATF2, which is mediated by p38 MAPK-, JNK- and ERK-dependent pathways."

Notably, the overexpression of NDM29 also confers to malignant NB cells an unpredicted susceptibility to the effects of antiblastic drugs used in NB therapy.

An initial urge to cough, and an almost binary output suggests gating mechanisms that encode and modulate this defensive reflex.

Here we describe a critical component to cough gating, the central terminations of the cough receptors. A novel microinjection strategy defined coordinates for microinjection of glutamate receptor antagonists that nearly abolished cough evoked from the trachea and larynx in anesthetized guinea pigs while having no effect on basal respiratory rate and little or no effect on reflexes attributed to activating other afferent nerve subtypes. Comparable microinjections in adjacent brainstem locations (0.5-2 mm distal) were without effect on coughing. Subsequent transganglionic and dual tracing studies confirmed that the central terminations of the cough receptors and their primary relay neurons are found bilaterally within nucleus tractus solitarius (nTS), lateral to the commissural subnucleus and perhaps in the medial subnuclei. These synapses possess the physiological characteristics of a cough gate. Their localization should facilitate more mechanistic studies of the encoding and gating of cough."
https://openalex.org/W2082450074,"Toxoplasma gondii is an intracellular protozoan parasite that can cause devastating disease in fetuses and immune-compromised individuals. We previously reported that the alpha subunit of the host cell transcription factor, hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1), is up-regulated by infection and necessary for Toxoplasma growth. Under basal conditions, HIF-1alpha is constitutively expressed but rapidly targeted for proteasomal degradation after two proline residues are hydroxylated by a family of prolyl hydroxylases (PHDs). The PHDs are alpha-ketoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases that have low K(m) values for oxygen, making them important cellular oxygen sensors. Thus, when oxygen levels decrease, HIF-1alpha is not hydroxylated, and HIF-1 is activated. How Toxoplasma activates HIF-1 under normoxic conditions remains unknown. Here, we report that Toxoplasma infection increases HIF-1alpha stability by preventing HIF-1alpha prolyl hydroxylation. Infection significantly decreases PHD2 abundance, which is the key prolyl hydroxylase for regulating HIF-1alpha. The effects of Toxoplasma on HIF-1alpha abundance and prolyl hydroxylase activity require activin-like receptor kinase signaling. Finally, parasite growth is severely diminished when signaling from this family of receptors is inhibited. Together, these data indicate that PHD2 is a key host cell factor for T. gondii growth and represent a novel mechanism by which a microbial pathogen subverts host cell signaling and transcription to establish its replicative niche."

We report here that a nuclear-localized portion of the stress-activated kinase JNK is degraded by the APC/CCdh1 during exit from mitosis and the G1 phase of the cell cycle. Expression of a non-degradable JNK induces prometaphase-like arrest and aberrant mitotic spindle dynamics. Moreover, JNK phosphorylates Cdh1 directly, during G2 and early mitosis, changing its subcellular localization and attenuating its ability to activate the APC/C during G2/M. This regulatory mechanism between JNK and Cdh1 reveals an important function for JNK during the cell cycle."

To test the importance of AKAP-mediated targeting of PKA on cardiac function, we designed a cell-permeable peptide, which we termed trans-activator of transcription (TAT)-AKAD for TAT-conjugated A-kinase-anchoring disruptor, using the PKA binding region of AKAP10 and tested the effects of this peptide in isolated cardiac myocytes and in Langendorff-perfused mouse hearts. We initially validated TAT-AKAD as a PKA localization inhibitor in cardiac myocytes by the use of confocal microscopy and cellular fractionation to show that treatment with the peptide disrupts type I and type II PKA regulatory subunits. Knockdown of PKA activity was demonstrated by decrease in phosphorylation of phospholamban and troponin I after beta-adrenergic stimulation in isolated myocytes. Treatment with TAT-AKAD reduced myocyte shortening and rates of contraction and relaxation. Injection of TAT-AKAD (1 microM), but not scrambled control peptide, into the coronary circulation of isolated perfused hearts rapidly (<1 min) and reversibly decreased heart rate and peak left ventricular developed pressure. TAT-AKAD also had a pronounced effect on developed pressure (-dP/dt), consistent with a delayed relaxation of the heart. The effects of TAT-AKAD on heart rate and contractility persisted in hearts pretreated with isoproterenol. Disruption of PKA localization with TAT-AKAD thus had negative effects on chronotropy, inotropy, and lusitropy, thereby indicating a key role for AKAP-targeted PKA in control of heart rate and contractile function."

However, much work remains to be done before pluripotent cells can be used for preclinical and clinical applications. Here we discuss the challenges of generating specific neural cell subtypes from pluripotent stem cells, the use of pluripotent stem cells to model both cell-autonomous and non-cell-autonomous mechanisms of neurodegeneration, whether adult-onset neurodegeneration can be emulated in short-term cultures and the hurdles of cell replacement therapy.

https://openalex.org/W2009878917,"A dynamic mathematical model has been developed and validated to describe the synthesis of pectate lyases (Pels), the major virulence factors in Dickeya dadantii. This work focuses on the simultaneous modeling of the metabolic degradation of pectin by Pel enzymes and the genetic regulation of pel genes by 2-keto-3-deoxygluconate (KDG), a catabolite product of pectin that inactivates KdgR, one of the main repressors of pel genes. This modeling scheme takes into account the fact that the system is composed of two time-varying compartments: the extracellular medium, where Pel enzymes cleave pectin into oligomers, and the bacterial cytoplasm where, after internalization, oligomers are converted to KDG. Using the quasi-stationary state approximations, the model consists of some nonlinear differential equations for which most of the parameters could be estimated from the literature or from independent experiments. The few remaining unknown parameters were obtained by fitting the model equations against a set of Pel activity data. Model predictions were verified by measuring the time courses of bacterial growth, Pel production, pel mRNA accumulation, and pectin consumption under various growth conditions. This work reveals that pectin is almost totally consumed before the burst of Pel production. This paradoxical behavior can be interpreted as an evolutionary strategy to control the diffusion process so that as soon as a small amount of pectin is detected by the bacteria in its surroundings, it anticipates more pectin to come. The model also predicts the possibility of bistable steady states in the presence of constant pectin compounds."

Here we demonstrate the biophysical interaction of FliS (HP0753) and the uncharacterized protein HP1076 from H. pylori. HP1076 possesses a cochaperone activity that promotes the folding and chaperone activity of FliS. We further determined the crystal structures of FliS, HP1076, and the binary complex at 2.7, 1.8, and 2.7 Å resolution, respectively. HP1076 adopts a helix-rich bundle structure and interestingly shares a similar fold with a flagellin homologue, hook-associated protein, and FliS. The FliS-HP1076 complex revealed an extensive electrostatic and hydrophobic binding interface, which is distinct from the flagellin binding pocket in FliS. The helical stacking interaction between HP1076 and FliS suggests that HP1076 stabilizes 2 α helices of FliS and therefore the overall structure of the bundle.

https://openalex.org/W1972892913,"As some stem cell researchers move ahead with clinical trials of new therapies, they're facing criticism from others in the field who argue the transition is premature. Tensions between the two factions have been intensified by the spotlight of political controversy and media attention, triggering heated debates in the pages of journals and at meetings. “People have very firm viewpoints on this,” says Joshua Hare, a cardiologist and director of the Interdisciplinary Stem Cell Institute at the University of Miami's Miller School of Medicine. “There are different schools of thought because people perceive the stakes as so high.” Among researchers investigating potential cardiac therapies based on adult stem cells–currently one of the more contentious areas of research–“There's a huge spectrum of skepticism and concern, and enthusiasm,” according to Richard Cannon, a cardiologist at the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI). “I don't think I'm overstating the tension there is between basic scientists and clinical investigators, at least in some quarters.” George Daley, a hematologist and director of the Stem Cell Transplantation Program at Children's Hospital Boston, attributes that largely to “a clash of cultures” between basic scientists and clinical investigators. Hare, who has begun clinical trials using bone marrow-derived stem cells to treat heart disease, agrees, saying, “Someone who sees patients and treats patients is going to be much more comfortable taking these therapies into trials, particularly in settings with major unmet needs.” The debate flared up at the NHLBI's third Symposium on Cardiovascular Regenerative Medicine late last year where clinical investigators were the targets of criticism during a panel discussion. Cannon, who is investigating the potential of bone marrow-derived stem cells to repair diseased and damaged blood vessels in patients with coronary artery disease, says, “We were pretty much taken to task for endorsing or performing clinical research without knowing everything there is to know about the mechanism of cell-based approaches to heart disease.” Clinical investigators, Daley says, “are much more tolerant of uncertainties in mechanism, whereas “arguably the greatest insight into mechanism comes from the stem cell scientific community,” he adds. “I think that's where cultural wars will be fought.” Daley describes himself as “fairly conservative” on the matter of when it's appropriate to begin clinical trials of adult stem cell therapies. Understanding the mechanism of action isn't an absolute prerequisite, he says, but if it's not clear, “that does have to give one extra pause” if there's even a plausible risk to patients. Nonetheless, Daley says he has “a healthy respect for the value of pure empiricism in medical innovation.” Many therapies that are commonly used today, Hare points out, were administered to patients for years before researchers understood their mechanism of action. When bone marrow transplants were first performed, for example, no one really knew how they worked. Plenty of other invaluable therapies, such as lithium, which has long been the standard treatment for bipolar disorder, remain largely a mystery in terms of their mechanism. “If a patient had a problem,” Hare says, “and there was a proven treatment, but we didn't know the mechanism, most treating physicians would use it.” Martin Friedlander, a cell biologist and ophthalmologist at Scripps Clinic and The Scripps Research Institute, says, “I'm not so hung up on the mechanism thing, I'm hung up on the safety thing.” In particular, says Friedlander, who is investigating the use of adult stem cells to treat vision loss, but hasn't tested the approach in clinical trials, researchers should know exactly what kind of cells are being administered, and understand how they may behave, before testing them in humans. “If there's evidence from large animal models that the cells do something beneficial, even if you don't know exactly how they accomplish that, and as long as there's no suspicion harm, I think it's reasonable to take those cells into trials in patients with potentially life-threatening heart disease,” Cannon says. “There's only so much you can learn about what cells can do and can't do,” from animal studies, Cannon adds. “The field is bound to move forward prior to us having a really good sense of the range of risks and rewards,” Daley says. “This is something that is seen with any new medical technology. There's nothing new with stem cells other than them having attracted a lot of attention.” Unfortunately, Daley adds, the attention that's been paid to stem cells and their therapeutic potential—largely because of the political controversy over human embryonic stem cell research—has fueled medical profiteers. There are advertisements all over the Internet from clinics around the world, touting stem cell treatments for everything from spinal cord injuries to autism to cancer. “It's unethical, and in the United States, it would be illegal,” Friedlander says. The therapies on offer at these rogue clinics may be pointless, or potentially dangerous, but there are plenty of people facing the prospect of losing their vision or living the rest of their life in a wheelchair, who are prepared to take that chance. “There's so little being offered in the United States that people are leaving,” says Hare, who sees that as all the more reason to proceed with clinical trials of potential stem cell therapies. He'd like to see a clinic set up in the United States to do “aggressive translational work, so that these poor people can get therapy ethically, rigorously, and with proper monitoring, and they can get the best therapy available. These programs need to be under FDA-approved research protocols so we can learn and optimize the approaches.” Daley worries that all the attention that's been paid to potential stem cell therapies has not only created an opportunity for medical profiteers, it's also generated tremendous optimism that can all too easily veer into wishful thinking. “There are some people out there who think they know more than they do,” Daley says. “It's like anything else. You're always going to have cowboys and cowgirls who are out there doing stuff before everyone else,” Friedlander adds. “You've got these predators who are looking to make a quick dollar, and then there are clinicians who are well-meaning but relatively uninformed about how to use these cells,” Friedlander says. “It's pretty easy for professionals in the [stem cell] community to look at some of these and recognize what's beyond the pale, but there's a huge gray area,” of work that's well intentioned but misguided, Daley says. He regards cardiac stem cell therapies as a prime example of clinical studies that are advancing without an adequate understanding of mechanism, “There are a lot of stem cell biologists who believe they are an enormous waste of resources.” The criticism irks Hare, who is conducting Phase II trials using bone marrow stem cells, administered intravenously, to treat patients after heart attacks. “We've done everything right. We should be beyond criticism,” Hare says. “It's hard to understand why people stand up and say, ‘You've gone too far.’ The arguments against moving into the clinic go against conventional wisdom. We're following basic principles of therapeutic development,” Hare adds. “No one would have questioned this if we were developing a drug.” Cannon says some of the discomfort over stem cell-based approaches to the treatment of heart disease may be because “we're talking about a very new approach.” While hematologists have been using cell-based therapies for decades, for cardiologists, “this is a new paradigm,” he says. Friedlander worries that some researchers “may not have a clear understanding of how much damage you can do with an approach that hasn't been thoroughly vetted. If someone jumps the gun and there's a setback that's serious,” he adds, “that puts the whole field back.” Gene therapy is a case in point. It was hailed as a potential medical revolution during the 1980s, but later clinical trials yielded disappointing, and in a few cases, tragic, results, although Hare says, “We learned something really important—that it had unanticipated toxicity.” Daley says those trials were premature and researchers had yet to learn how hard it would be to achieve gene transfer. That's a good lesson for the stem cell field, he says. “We've not yet faced the sobering reality of how difficult it's going to be.” It won't be easy, either, to achieve an armistice among stem cell researchers. Those on the frontlines agree, though, that rather than letting the two sides huddle in their trenches, emerging only occasionally to face each other in battle, it's essential to get the warring factions engaged in productive discussions. “We need to get basic scientists and clinical researchers in the room together so they can talk about their motivations and views and experiences,” Cannon says, “so hopefully the field moves forward.” The NHLBI aims to accomplish that via its Progenitor Cell Biology Consortium, established last fall. It's also a goal of the ISSCR, says Daley, who was president of the society from 2007–2008 and led the ISSCR taskforce that developed guidelines for human embryonic stem research. “We're trying to create opportunities to bring those two communities together.” “It should be a partnership,” Cannon says. “Clinical trials should proceed along with basic research. It's not an either-or situation.” After all, he adds, there's a good dose of mystery in medicine. “To wait to understand everything about these cells may delay the potential they have for therapeutic use. There's an unknown, and perhaps an unknowable.”"
