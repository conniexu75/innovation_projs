https://openalex.org/W1970121767,"Monocytes and macrophages, which may play a central role in the pathogenesis of infection with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), express the CD4 molecule and Fc receptors (FcR) for immunoglobulin G (IgG). To explore the possibility that FcR mediate HIV-1 infection of monocytes, studies were conducted with the human monocytic cell line U937. These cells were exposed to HIV-1 complexed with various concentrations of serum from HIV-1 antibody-positive individuals and monitored for HIV-1 replication. Serum samples from antibody-negative normal individuals did not affect virus yields. High concentrations of antibody-positive sera showed virus-neutralizing activity; however, cells infected with HIV-1 in the presence of antibody-positive sera at subneutralizing concentrations significantly enhanced virus replication. This infection enhancement was blocked by heat-aggregated gamma-globulin. Moreover, the IgG fraction from an HIV-1 antibody-positive serum enhanced HIV-1 infection at the same serum dilution equivalents. In contrast, IgG-F(ab')2 did not enhance HIV-1 infection but showed neutralizing activity with HIV-1. These results are compatible with the concept of FcR-mediated infection enhancement and suggest that this immunological response to HIV-1, instead of protecting the host, potentially facilitates the infection."
https://openalex.org/W2018522670,"The Fcε receptor II (FcεRII, CD23) functions in B cell growth and differentiation and in IgE-mediated immunity. The FcεRII structure expressed on various cell types has been analyzed identifying two species, FcεRIIa and FcεRIIb. Sequence analysis of the cloned cDNAs revealed that they differ only at the N-terminal cytoplasmic region, but share the same C-terminal extracellular region. These FcεRII species appear to be generated utilizing different transcriptional initiation sites and alternative RNA splicing. FcεRIIa is constitutively expressed only in normal B cells and B cell lines, whereas FcεRIIb expression is detectable in various cell types, such as monocytes and eosinophils. Normally, FcεRIIb is undetectable in B cells and monocytes, and can be induced by interleukin-4. Moreover, FcεRIIb is expressed on peripheral blood lymphocytes in atopic individuals. These findings may explain the difference in FcεRIIa and FcεRIIb function in B cells and the effector phase of IgE-mediated immunity."
https://openalex.org/W1511676968,"The activation of human T-lymphocytes by anti-CD3 antibodies and interleukin-2 results in a marked increase in apparent molecular weight of the major cell-surface sialoglycoprotein. Both forms of the sialoglycoprotein were identified as leukosialin by a monospecific antiserum, and the differences in molecular weight were found to be due to changes in the carbohydrate structures. Our results suggest that resting T-lymphocytes express on leukosialin the disialotetrasaccharides NeuNAc alpha 2----3Gal beta 1----3(NeuNAc alpha 2----6)Gal-NAc-Ser/Thr, whereas activated human T-cells carry on leukosialin exclusively the more complex structures NeuNAc alpha 2----3Gal beta 1----3(NeuNAc alpha 2----3Gal beta 1----4GlcNAc beta 1----6)GalNAc-Ser/Thr. The radical shift in the biosynthetic pathway of O-glycans in activated T-lymphocytes compared to resting cells is apparently caused by a decrease of alpha 2----6 sialyltransferase activity and by the parallel dramatic stimulation of the beta 1----6GlcNAc-transferase. Since both enzymes compete for the same precursor substrate, the coordinate changes in their activities are most likely responsible for the complete change of the carbohydrate structures on leukosialin during the activation of human T-lymphocytes."

https://openalex.org/W2013836961,"Splicing of nuclear precursor messenger RNA (pre-mRNA) occurs on a large ribonucleoprotein complex, the spliceosome. Several small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNP's) are subunits of this complex that assembles on the pre-mRNA. Although the U1 snRNP is known to recognize the 5' splice site, its roles in spliceosome formation and splice site alignment have been unclear. A new affinity purification method for the spliceosome is described which has provided insight into the very early stages of spliceosome formation in a yeast in vitro splicing system. Surprisingly, the U1 snRNP initially recognizes sequences at or near both splice junctions in the intron. This interaction must occur before the other snRNP's (U2, U4, U5, and U6) can join the complex. The results suggest that interaction of the two splice site regions occurs at an early stage of spliceosome formation and is probably mediated by U1 snRNP and perhaps other factors."

https://openalex.org/W1602528313,"Human amniotic fluid has been shown to contain a protein that binds insulin-like growth factor I and II (IGF-I and IGF-II). Partially purified preparations of this protein have been reported to inhibit the biologic actions of the IGFs. In these studies our laboratory has used a modified purification procedure to obtain a homogeneous preparation of this protein as determined by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and amino acid sequence analysis. During purification the ion exchange chromatography step resulted in two peaks of material with IGF binding activity termed peaks B and C. Each peak was purified separately to homogeneity. Both peaks were estimated to be 31,000 daltons by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and their amino acid compositions were nearly identical. Amino acid sequence analysis showed that both peaks had identical N-terminal sequences through the first 28 residues. Neither protein had detectable carbohydrate side chains and each had a similar affinity for radiolabeled IGF-I (1.7-2.2 x 10(10) liters/mol). In contrast, these two forms had marked differences in bioactivity. Concentrations of peak C material between 2 and 20 ng/ml inhibited IGF-I stimulation of [3H]thymidine incorporation into smooth muscle cell DNA. In contrast, when peak B (100 ng/ml) was incubated with IGF-I there was a 4.4-fold enhancement of stimulation of DNA synthesis. Additionally, pure peak B was shown to adhere to cell surfaces, whereas peak C was not adherent. The non-adherent peak C inhibited IGF-I binding to its receptor and to adherent peak B. We conclude that human amniotic fluid contains two forms of IGF binding protein that have very similar physiochemical characteristics but markedly different biologic actions. Since both have similar if not identical amino acid compositions, N-terminal sequences, and do not contain carbohydrate, we conclude that they differ in some other as yet undefined post-translational modification."
https://openalex.org/W1894312995,Recombinant transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-beta 1) precursor produced and secreted by a clone of Chinese hamster ovary cells was found to be glycosylated and phosphorylated. Treatment of 32P-labeled precursor protein with N-glycanase indicated that phosphate was incorporated into asparagine-linked complex carbohydrate moieties. Fractionation of 32P-labeled glycopeptides followed by amino acid sequence analysis indicated that greater than 95% of the label was incorporated into two out of three glycosylation sites at Asn-82 and Asn-136 of the TGF-beta 1 precursor. Two-dimensional electrophoretic analysis of acid hydrolyzed precursor protein and precursor protein-derived glycopeptides indicated that 32P was incorporated as mannose 6-phosphate. Binding studies with the purified receptor for mannose 6-phosphate indicated that the TGF-beta 1 precursor could bind to this receptor and the binding was specifically inhibited with mannose 6-phosphate.
https://openalex.org/W1551900159,Abstract Cyclophilin (cyclosporin A-binding protein) has a dual localization in the mitochondria and in the cytosol of Neurospora crassa. The two forms are encoded by a single gene which is transcribed into mRNAs having different lengths and 5' termini (approximately 1 and 0.8 kilobases). The shorter mRNA specifies the cytosolic protein consisting of 179 amino acids. The longer mRNA is translated into a precursor polypeptide with an amino-terminal extension of 44 amino acids which is cleaved in two steps upon entry into the mitochondrial matrix. Neurospora cyclophilin shows about 60% sequence homology to human and bovine cyclophilins.
https://openalex.org/W1651976025,"Kinetic analyses were done to determine what effect factor Xa and protein S had on the activated protein C (APC)-catalyzed inactivation of factor Va bound to phospholipid vesicles or human platelets. In the presence of optimal concentrations of phospholipid vesicles and Ca2+, a Km of 19.7 +/- 0.6 nM factor Va and a kcat of 23.7 +/- 10 mol of factor Va inactivated/mol of APC/min were obtained. Added purified plasma protein S increased the maximal rate of factor Va inactivation only 2-fold without effect on the Km. Protein S effect was unaltered when the phospholipid concentration was varied by 2 orders of magnitude. The reaction on unactivated human platelets yielded a Km = 12.5 +/- 2.6 nM and kcat = 6.2 +/- 0.6 mol of factor Va inactivated/mol of APC/min. Added purified plasma protein S or release of platelet protein S by platelet activation doubled the kcat value without affecting the Km. Addition of a neutralizing anti-protein S antibody abrogated the effect of plasma protein S or platelet-released protein S, but was without effect in the absence of plasma protein S or platelet activation. Studies with factor Xa indicated that factor Xa protects factor Va from APC-catalyzed inactivation by lowering the effective concentration of factor Va available to interact with APC. From these data a dissociation constant of less than 0.5 nM was calculated for the interaction of factor Xa with membrane-bound factor Va. Protein S abrogated the ability of factor Xa to protect factor Va from inactivation by APC without affecting the interaction of factor Xa with factor Va. These combined data suggest that one physiological function of protein S is to allow the APC-catalyzed inactivation of factor Va in the presence of factor Xa."
https://openalex.org/W1883802169,"In this paper we elucidate part of the mechanism of the early stages of the biosynthesis of glycogen. This macromolecule is constructed by covalent apposition of glucose units to a protein, glycogenin, which remains covalently attached to the mature glycogen molecule. We have now isolated, in a 3500-fold purification, a protein from rabbit muscle that has the same Mr as glycogenin, is immunologically similar, and proves to be a self-glucosylating protein (SGP). When incubated with UDP-[14C]glucose, an average of one molecular proportion of glucose is incorporated into the protein, which we conclude is the same as glycogenin isolated from native glycogen. The native SGP appears to exist as a high-molecular-weight species that contains many identical subunits. Because the glucose that is self-incorporated can be released almost completely from the acceptor by glycogenolytic enzymes, the indication is that it was added to a preformed chain or chains of 1,4-linked alpha-glucose residues. This implies that SGP already carries an existing maltosaccharide chain or chains to which the glucose is added, rather than glucose being added directly to protein. The putative role of SGP in glycogen synthesis is confirmed by the fact that glucosylated SGP acts as a primer for glycogen synthase and branching enzyme to form high-molecular-weight material. SGP itself is completely free from glycogen synthase. The quantity of SGP in muscle is calculated to be about one-half the amount of glycogenin bound in glycogen."
https://openalex.org/W1553039892,"The octaethyleneglycol mono-n-dodecyl ether solubilized Ca2+-ATPase purified from human erythrocytes has been studied to determine the physical mechanism of its activation by calmodulin. The dependence of Ca2+-ATPase activity on the enzyme concentration shows a transformation from a calmodulin-dependent to a fully active calmodulin-independent form. The transformation is cooperative with a half-maximal activation at 10-20 nM enzyme. This suggests that at higher enzyme concentrations interactions between Ca2+-ATPase polypeptide chains substitute for calmodulin-enzyme interactions, resulting in activation. In support of this interpretation, the inclusion of higher octaethyleneglycol mono-n-dodecyl ether concentrations shifts the half-maximal transformation to higher enzyme concentrations. Regardless of the detergent concentration, calmodulin decreases by about 2-fold the enzyme concentration required to observe half-maximal Ca2+-ATPase activation, without affecting the maximal velocity or cooperativity. This indicates that calmodulin facilitates interactions between enzyme molecules. The fluorescein-5′-isothiocyanate-modified Ca2+-ATPase shows an increase in fluorescence polarization which occurs over the same narrow concentration range that is seen with the Ca2+-ATPase activity, confirming association of enzyme molecules. Stimulation of the Ca2+-ATPase activity by calmodulin has revealed a stoichiometry of 0.73, with a dissociation constant of 1.6 nM calmodulin. We have demonstrated by use of calmodulin-Sepharose chromatography that both the calmodulin-dependent and independent Ca2+-ATPase forms bind calmodulin, even though stimulation of activity is seen only with the former one. Our data suggest the following two mechanisms for the Ca2+-ATPase activation: self-association of enzyme molecules or interaction with calmodulin."
https://openalex.org/W1504739885,"Neural cells in culture (NG-108, PC12, chick dorsal root ganglion, chick spinal cord, and rat astrocytes) bind laminin with an apparent Kd of congruent to 10(-9) M. Laminin affinity chromatography of chick brain membranes washed with 150 mM NaCl and eluted with 0.2 M glycine buffer, pH 3.5, yields a single protein with an apparent molecular mass of 67 kDa by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under reducing conditions. Isoelectric focusing and peptide mapping indicate that the 67-kDa protein is distinct from bovine serum albumin (68 kDa) but indistinguishable from high affinity laminin receptors isolated from skeletal muscle. After electroblotting onto nitrocellulose paper and probing with 125I-laminin, this putative laminin receptor binds laminin specifically (100 ng/ml). A second protein (congruent to 120-140 kDa) is also detected with 125I-laminin (100 ng/ml) in the laminin affinity-purified membrane proteins. Both 67- and congruent to 120-140-kDa proteins can be laminin affinity-purified from cultures enriched for neurons (greater than 90%) following metabolic labeling with [35S]methionine. Our data suggest that neural cells (dorsal root ganglion, central nervous system neurons, astrocytes, and several neural cell lines) have high affinity binding sites for laminin and that two membrane proteins, 67- and congruent to 120-140-kDa, are responsible at least in part for this binding."
https://openalex.org/W1557216465,"We have investigated the mechanism by which reduced folates, such as folinic acid, enhance the cytotoxicity of fluoropyrimidines in L1210 mouse leukemic cells. Exposure of L1210 cells to folinic acid resulted in expansion of intracellular pools of 5,10-CH2-H4PteGlun, delayed the reappearance of catalytically active thymidylate synthase (TS) following 5-fluoro-2′-deoxyuridine exposure, and stabilized inhibited TS complexes over the same concentration range that augmented the cytotoxic effects of fluorodeoxyuridine and 5-fluorouracil. The data showed that, in intact L1210 cells, fluorodeoxyridylate behaves as an inhibitor whose complexes with TS dissociated with a biologically significant rate. However, these complexes become functionally irreversible in cells incubated with high levels of folinic acid. It was also found that bound and total TS levels increased in cells treated with fluorodeoxyuridine to an extent that substantially exceeded the increase in protein content per cell under the same conditions. These results are in accord with the concept that folinic acid augments the effects of the fluoropyrimidines by expansion of cellular 5,10-CH2-H4PteGlun pools with subsequent stabilization of ternary complexes among 5-fluoro-2′-deoxyuridine 5′-monophosphate, TS, and 5,10-CH2-H4PteGlun. In light of the accumulation of TS that occurs following exposure to fluoropyrimidines, this stabilization may be needed for efficient tumor cell killing by these agents."
https://openalex.org/W1595266446,"A monoclonal antibody specific for cardiac troponin T has been used to investigate troponin changes during development in the rat heart. Specificity of the antibody was determined by immunoblot analysis with purified bovine cardiac troponin. In the rat heart, immunoblot analysis shows that anticardiac troponin T reacts with a 42.5-kDa band in fetal ventricles and with a 41-kDa band in adult ventricles. The faster migrating troponin T is present in traces in the fetal heart and increases markedly during the first 2 weeks after birth, concomitantly with the progressive decrease of the slower migrating form that is no longer detectable in the adult. The pattern of reactivity of the monoclonal antibody is not modified by alkaline phosphatase pretreatment, suggesting that the antibody is not specific for a phosphorylated epitope. Conditions known to affect cardiac myosin composition, such as hypothyroidism and hypertrophy secondary to systemic hypertension, do not change the troponin T isoform profile of adult rat ventricles. The expression and accumulation of the adult isoforms of troponin T are not suppressed by propylthiouracil treatment of pregnant and nursing rats."

https://openalex.org/W1583315626,"Isoelectric focusing of purified vascular smooth muscle myosin revealed two variants of the 17,000-dalton light chain subunits. The isoelectric points of the light chain variants were determined to be 4.13 (LC17a) and 4.19 (LC17b). Tryptic peptide maps of the two species of light chain generated by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography disclosed small but obvious differences in peptide composition while amino acid analyses of the variants were quite similar. Two-dimensional electrophoresis of extracts from various mammalian smooth muscles revealed tissue-specific differences in the relative content of LC17a and LC17b. Vascular (aorta, carotid, and pulmonary artery) muscles and tracheal smooth muscle contained both light chain variants while smooth muscle of the gastrointestinal tract (stomach and jejunum) contained LC17a only. The actin-activated Mg2+-ATPase activities of both phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated stomach (LC17b = 0) and aortic (LC17b = 40%) myosins were compared. In the presence of saturating tropomyosin, a 2-fold difference in Vmax was measured: phosphorylated, aortic, 0.119 +/- 0.009 versus stomach, 0.239 +/- 0.012 mumol of PO4 liberated/min/mg of myosin; nonphosphorylated, aortic, 0.065 +/- 0.004 versus stomach, 0.123 +/- 0.004 mumol of PO4 liberated/min/mg of myosin. In addition, the Vmax of myosin subfragment-1 ATPase from bovine aortic, pulmonary artery, and stomach myosins (LC17b contents, 40, 20, and 0%, respectively) was found to decrease in direct proportion to the LC17b content. Our results suggest that isoforms of the 17,000-dalton light chain subunits of mammalian smooth muscle myosin could play an important role in modulating actomyosin ATPase activity."
https://openalex.org/W1574030741,"Five proteins from human placenta capable of inhibiting pancreatic phospholipase A2 were purified. Two of these proteins were identified as lipocortins I and II. The other three proteins were immunologically distinct from lipocortins I and II and had apparent subunit molecular masses of 32, 33, and 73 kDa as estimated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Amino acid sequence analysis of peptides produced by cyanogen bromide digestion indicated sequence homology of these proteins with lipocortin I and the heavy chain subunit of lipocortin II. Two of these proteins were identified as endonexin II and 67-kDa calelectrin. The third protein appears to be the human form of bovine endonexin I, also characterized as porcine protein II. Sedimentation equilibrium analysis of lipocortin I, endonexin I and II, and the 67-kDa calelectrin suggested monomer-dimer equilibria with dissociation constants in the range of 0.33-1.3 X 10(-3) M and monomer molecular masses of 38,050, 36,400, 36,850, and 73,610 Da, respectively. Self-association of lipocortin II was described by dimerization of a protomer (K12 = 5.3 x 10(-7) M), followed by an indefinite self-association of the dimer (isodesmic dissociation constant, Kiso = 3.6 x 10(-6) M). The protomer molecular mass was 48,800 Da, consistent with a heterodimeric structure composed of one heavy (38,600 Da) and one light (10,944 Da) chain as previously characterized for lipocortin II. Sedimentation equilibrium analysis of mixtures of individual protein inhibitors and purified pancreatic phospholipase A2 indicated weak association between enzyme and inhibitor (Kd greater than or equal to 3 x 10(-5) M), insufficient to account for the observed inhibition of enzyme activity."

https://openalex.org/W1576398733,"We report here that the human interleukin-1 beta precursor (proIL-1 beta) protein as well as several interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) subpeptides bind cellular receptors specifically and exhibit biological activity by stimulating proliferation of helper T-cells. IL-1 beta polypeptides have been synthesized by in vitro translation of mRNAs transcribed from plasmid vectors containing the bacteriophage SP6 promoter joined to the complete IL-1 beta cDNA or to deletion constructs. The quantity of IL-1 beta in vitro translation products was increased significantly by replacing the cognate IL-1 beta untranslated leader sequence with a 37-nucleotide plant viral untranslated leader. Translation of chimeric mRNAs followed by direct bioactivity assay demonstrated that mature IL-1 beta-(117-269), proIL-1 beta-(1-269), and peptide IL-1-(71-269) were all biologically active. Specific binding to cellular receptors was observed with these three IL-1 beta molecules; moreover, several peptides with minimal biological activity also bound receptor specifically. The biological activity and receptor binding properties of the IL-1 beta proteins reported here contrast with those described by Mosley et al. (Mosley, B., Urdal, D. L., Prickett, K. S., Larsen, A., Cosman, D., Conlon, P. J., Gillis, S., and Dower, S. K. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 2941-2944; Mosley, B., Dower, S. K., Gillis, S., and Cosman, D. (1987) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 84, 4572-4576), who reported that proIL-1 beta-(1-269) had no biological activity and does not bind receptor. Our results indicate that proIL-1 beta is active at a relatively high concentration, and analysis of the proIL-1 beta-(1-269) and IL-1-(71-269) bioactivity data suggests a possible relationship with membrane-bound IL-1."
https://openalex.org/W1639167750,"A proteolytic fragment of recA protein, missing about 15% of the protein at the C terminus, was found to promote assimilation of homologous single-stranded DNA into duplex DNA more efficiently than intact recA protein. This difference was not found if Escherichia coli single-stranded DNA binding protein was present. The ATPase activity of both intact recA protein and the fragment was identical. The difference in strand assimilation activity cannot be due to differences in single-stranded DNA affinity, since both the fragment and intact proteins bind to single-stranded DNA with nearly identical affinities. However, the fragment was found to bind double-stranded DNA more tightly and to aggregate more extensively than recA protein; both of these properties may be important in strand assimilation. Aggregation of the fragment was extensive in the presence of duplex DNA under the same condition where recA protein did not aggregate. The double-stranded DNA binding of both recA protein and the fragment responds to nucleotide cofactors in the same manner as single-stranded DNA binding, i.e. ADP weakens and ATP gamma S strengthens the association. The missing C-terminal region of recA protein includes a very acidic region that is homologous to other single-stranded DNA binding proteins and which has been implicated in DNA binding modulation. This C-terminal region may serve a similar function in recA protein, possibly inhibiting double-stranded DNA invasion. The possible role of the enhanced double-stranded DNA affinity of the fragment protein in the mechanism of strand assimilation is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1820775226,"A functionally active human microplasminogen without kringle structures was produced by incubation of plasminogen with urokinase-free plasmin at an alkaline pH. The microplasminogen was purified by affinity chromatography on lysine- and soybean trypsin inhibitor-Sepharose and by chromofocusing. Human plasminogen is specifically cleaved at Arg529-Lys530 by plasmin to form microplasminogen, which consists of a single polypeptide of 261 residues from the COOH-terminal portion of native plasminogen. It has an Mr of 28,617, calculated from the sequence, which is consistent with the molecular weight determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis. Microplasminogen is a slightly basic protein and is eluted from a chromofocusing column at pH 8.3. It can be activated by urokinase and streptokinase to a catalytically active microplasmin. The specific amidolytic activity of microplasmin is about three times higher than Lys77-plasmin on a weight basis and is about the same on a molar basis. The activation of microplasminogen by streptokinase is slower than that of either Glu-plasminogen or Lys77-plasminogen. On the other hand, the activation of microplasminogen by urokinase is faster than that of either of the latter. The Arg560-Val561 bond is cleaved during activation of both microplasminogen and native plasminogen."
https://openalex.org/W1582584861,"We report here that complement receptor type one (CR1) binds to a region of C3b that is contained within the NH2 terminus of the alpha' chain. In an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, CR1 bound to C3b, iC3b, and C3c but not to C3d, and this binding was inhibited by soluble C3b and C3c. Further attempts to generate a small C3 fragment capable of binding CR1 were unsuccessful. However, elastase degradation of C3 generated four species of C3c (C3c I-IV), two of which bound CR1. NH2-terminal sequence analysis and sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel electrophoresis of the C3cs indicated that the beta chains and the 40,000-dalton COOH-terminal alpha' chain fragments were identical; the NH2-terminal alpha' chain fragments of C3c I-IV varied from 21,000 to 27,000 daltons and accounted for the differential binding to CR1. C3c-I and II, which do not bind CR1, were missing 8 and 9 residues from the NH2 terminus of the alpha' chain when compared with the intact alpha' chain of C3b. C3c-III and IV, which bind CR1, had NH2 termini identical to the intact NH2-terminal alpha' chain of C3b. Using iodinated concanavalin A and endoglycosidase H, we showed that the NH2-terminal alpha' chains of C3c-I and III were glycosylated, while C3c-II and IV were not. Therefore, these data indicated that the amino terminus of the NH2-terminal alpha' chain fragment of C3c was responsible for binding CR1 while the COOH terminus of this fragment was not involved since the presence or absence of this region in C3c did not affect CR1 binding to C3c. Subsequently, two peptides were synthesized from the NH2-terminal alpha' chain fragment of C3c: X42, 42 residues in length from the NH2 terminus and C30, 30 residues in length from the COOH terminus. X42 inhibited binding of CR1 to C3b, and this effect was also observed with antipeptide antibodies against the X42 peptide. The C30 and other C3-derived peptides and antipeptide antibodies had no effect on the binding of CR1 to C3b."
https://openalex.org/W1594451479,"Human leukocytes express a receptor that mediates the binding of cells and particles coated with C3bi, a fragment of the third component of complement. Previous data indicate that the capacity of this receptor to mediate binding is regulated by changes in its aggregation state. Randomly distributed receptors bind ligand very inefficiently, but stimulation of polymorphonuclear leukocytes with phorbol esters causes a ligand-independent clustering of the receptors in the membrane, and the clustered receptors avidly bind C3bi-coated cells (1). We examined whether the aggregation state of surface-bound ligands also affects the efficiency of binding between receptors and ligands. We found that erythrocytes bearing C3bi in clusters were bound by both macrophages and polymorphonuclear leukocytes far more avidly than erythrocytes bearing the same number of ligands in random array. We made similar observations with erythrocytes coated with C3b, a ligand that is recognized by a separate receptor. Our observations show that the ability of a receptor-bearing cell to bind particles coated with the corresponding ligands is dramatically affected by the distribution of ligand on the surface of the particle. Cell-cell interactions may thus be regulated by alterations in the two-dimensional distribution of receptors and ligands on opposing cell surfaces."
https://openalex.org/W1570083824,"Factor H is a regulatory protein of the alternative pathway of complement activation comprised of 20 tandem repeating units of 60 amino acids each. A factor H cDNA clone was used to identify 17 genomic clones from a cosmid library. Four clones were selected for analysis of intron/exon junctions and 5' and 3' regions of the gene and for mapping of the exons. The factor H gene was found to be comprised of 22 exons. Each repeating unit is encoded by one exon, except the second repeat, which is coded by two exons; the leader sequence is encoded by a separate exon. The exons range in size from 77 to 210 base pairs (bp) and average 178 bp. They span a region of approximately 100 kilobases (kb) on chromosome 1. The leader sequence exon is 26 kb upstream of the first repeat exon, representing the largest intron. The other introns range in size from 86 bp to 12.9 kb, and the average intron size is 4.7 kb. Analysis of the genomic organization of the factor H gene has provided insight into the protein structure and will enable the construction of deletion mutants for functional studies."
https://openalex.org/W1961885048,"We recently reported the cDNA cloning, sequence, and expression of the human cation-independent mannose 6-phosphate receptor (hCI-MPR) (Oshima, A., Nolan, C. M., Kyle, J. W., Grubb, J. H., and Sly, W. S. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 2553-2562). The sequence of the hCI-MPR was virtually identical to that of the human insulin-like growth factor II receptor cDNA (Morgan, D. O., Edman, J. C., Standring, D. N., Fried, V. A., Smith, M. C., Roth, R. A., and Rutter, W. J. (1987) Nature 329, 301-307). To test the role of the putative bifunctional receptor in intracellular sorting of acid hydrolases, we studied its effect on lysosomal enzyme transport following gene transfer to receptor-negative cells. Receptor-negative mouse P388D1 cells were transfected with a cDNA construct containing the entire coding sequence of hCI-MPR under the control of the mouse metallothionine I promoter. Stable transformants were isolated and characterized. The expressed hCI-MPR was localized in membranes including the plasma membrane, bound mannose 6-phosphate containing ligands, and mediated endocytosis which could be specifically blocked by mannose 6-phosphate. We next measured the effect of the expressed hCI-MPR on intracellular and secreted acid hydrolases. The intracellular activity of the lysosomal marker enzymes beta-glucuronidase and beta-hexosaminidase increased up to 2-fold following transformation. In addition, expression of the receptor greatly reduced the fraction of acid hydrolases secreted. These phenotypic changes in the transformed cell lines support the proposed role of the cation-independent mannose 6-phosphate receptor in intracellular sorting and targeting of lysosomal enzymes."

Four abnormal cDNA clones were sequenced in their entirety. We showed previously that three of these mRNAs retained intron 12 with a mutation from G to C at the 5' donor site and that the patient was heterozygous with respect to this splicing defect (Ohno, K., and Suzuki, K., (1988) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 153, 463-469). One clone retained, in addition to intron 12, intron 13, which was truncated and polyadenylated due to a polyadenylation signal within intron 13. The fourth clone did not contain intron 12 and was missing exon 12. Some of these abnormal mRNAs were also missing one or more of upstream exons. The regions of exon 12-intron 12 and of upstream exons were evaluated in a total of 30 clones, including those completely sequenced, by restriction mapping and Southern analysis with appropriate probes. Of the 25 cDNA clones that included the exon 12-intron 12 region, 11 contained the exon 12-intron 12 sequence with the junctional transversion, and 11 were missing both exon 12 and intron 12. Among the 12 clones that included the region of exon 3-exon 9, 7 were missing one or more of upstream exons. Three clones gave results expected of normal cDNA in the region of exons 12 and 13. One of the three, furthermore, was 3.6-kilobases long and contained the completely normal beta-hexosaminidase alpha chain mRNA sequence on the 3' side and an abnormal 1.7-kilobase segment at the 5' end. These findings suggest that the splicing defect results in either retention of intron 12 or skipping of exon 12 in approximately equal proportions and that remote upstream exons are also frequently excised out. The three clones that were normal in the exon 12-intron 12 region could have derived from the other yet-to-be-characterized mutant allele. However, we were unable to obtain firm evidence that the abnormal upstream sequence is directly related to Tay-Sachs disease."
https://openalex.org/W1596753336,"We have recently identified high and low affinity insulin-like growth factor I (IGF I) binding sites in solubilized human placental membranes and purified the high affinity IGF I receptor by IGF I affinity chromatography (Tollefsen, S. E., Thompson, K., and Petersen, D. J. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 16461-16469). To define the structural basis for high affinity IGF I binding, we have examined the effect of disulfide bond reduction on the binding parameters of the high affinity IGF I receptor. We find that the disulfide bonds linking the two alpha beta dimers of the IGF I receptor heterotetramer are reduced by incubation at pH 8.75 with 2 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) for 5 min at room temperature. Gel filtration chromatography on a Superose 12 fast protein liquid chromatography column indicates that the alpha beta dimers do not remain associated by noncovalent interactions after reduction. Scatchard plots of IGF I binding to the IGF I receptor incubated at pH 8.75 with or without DTT indicate that the IGF I receptor alpha beta dimers have a 6.1 +/- 1.6 (mean +/- S.D.) times lower affinity than the heterotetramer for IGF I. The total binding capacity of the IGF I receptor treated with DTT is 1.6 +/- 0.3 (mean +/- S.D.) times higher than that of an equal amount of receptor treated without DTT. These results are consistent with a model in which the heterotetramer binds a single IGF I molecule with high affinity, whereas each of the two alpha beta dimers binds an IGF I molecule with lower affinity after dissociation. We conclude that association of two alpha beta dimers is required for formation of an IGF I receptor with high affinity for its ligand."
https://openalex.org/W1557097517,"Termination of Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I large fragment after processive synthesis on natural and other well-defined template.primer systems has been examined. We found that after any given deoxynucleoside monophosphate incorporation termination occurs in a nonrandom manner with phi X174 DNA as template: Termination is much more likely at some nucleotide residues along the template than at others. Analysis of these stronger termination sites indicates that the template base:incoming nucleotide combination influences termination. Introduction of a double-stranded region along the phi X174 template induces termination, and reducing dNTP concentrations or substituting 2'-deoxynucleoside 5'-O-(1-thio)triphosphate substrates also increases termination. Observations with the phi X174 DNA template system were extended with a defined template containing 1 inosine residue in an otherwise d(T)n homopolymer. Termination at the I residue is modulated by dCTP and decreases as dCTP concentration increases. A similar relationship is seen with the dCTP (1-thio) derivative, but termination is higher at given concentrations of this derivative than with dCTP. Pyrophosphate decreases general processivity in this system, but does not counteract the effect of increasing dCTP. Hill plot analysis of the dCTP effect in the inosine-containing template system gave a linear plot with Hill coefficient of 0.34, suggesting that dCTP influences termination at several steps in the polymerase reaction scheme. Substituting a methylated template base for I also increased termination, producing very strong blocks to processive synthesis. The results are consistent with a model in which termination occurs with several enzyme forms that are in equilibrium in an ordered catalytic mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W1507303434,"Brain spectrin reassociates in in vitro binding assays with protein(s) in highly extracted brain membranes quantitatively depleted of ankyrin and spectrin. These newly described membrane sites for spectrin are biologically significant and involve a protein since (a) binding occurs optimally at physiological pH (6.7-6.9) and salt concentrations (50 mM), (b) binding is abolished by digestion of membranes with alpha-chymotrypsin, (c) Scatchard analysis is consistent with a binding capacity of at least 50 pmol/mg total membrane protein, and highest affinity of 3 nM. The major ankyrin-independent binding activity of brain spectrin is localized to the beta subunit of spectrin. Brain membranes also contain high affinity binding sites for erythrocyte spectrin, but a 3-4 fold lower capacity than for brain spectrin. Some spectrin-binding sites associate preferentially with brain spectrin, some with erythrocyte spectrin, and some associate with both types of spectrin. Erythrocyte spectrin contains distinct binding domains for ankyrin and brain membrane protein sites, since the Mr = 72,000 spectrin-binding fragment of ankyrin does not compete for binding of spectrin to brain membranes. Spectrin binds to a small number of ankyrin-independent sites in erythrocyte membranes present in about 10,000-15,000 copies/cell or 10% of the number of sites for ankyrin. Brain spectrin binds to these sites better than erythrocyte spectrin suggesting that erythrocytes have residual binding sites for nonerythroid spectrin. Ankyrin-independent-binding proteins that selectively bind to certain isoforms of spectrin provide a potentially important flexibility in cellular localization and time of synthesis of proteins involved in spectrin-membrane interactions. This flexibility has implications for assembly of the membrane skeleton and targeting of spectrin isoforms to specialized regions of cells."
https://openalex.org/W1531215851,"The pre-steady-state kinetics of phosphorylation of the Ca2+-ATPase by ATP was studied at 37 degrees C and in intact red cell membranes to approach physiological conditions. ATP and Ca2+ activate with K0.5 of 4.9 and 26.4 microM, respectively. Preincubation with Ca2+ did not change the K0.5 for ATP. Preincubation with ATP did not alter the initial velocity of phosphorylation suggesting that binding of ATP was not rate-limiting. Mg2+ added at the start of the reaction increased the initial rate of phosphorylation from 4 to 8 pmol/mg/s. With 30 microM Ca2+, the K0.5 for Mg2+ was 60 microM. Mg2+ and Ca2+ added together beforehand accelerated phosphorylation to 70 pmol/mg/s. Phosphorylation of calmodulin-bound membranes was the fastest (280 pmol/mg/s), and its time course showed a neat overshoot before steady state. The results suggest that either preincubation with Ca2+ plus Mg2+ or calmodulin accelerated phosphorylation shifting toward E1 the equilibrium between the E1 and E2 conformers of the enzyme. K+ had no effect on the initial rate of phosphorylation and lowered by 40% the steady-state level of phosphoenzyme in the absence of Mg2+. Phosphorylation is not rate-limiting for the overall reaction since its initial rate was always higher than ATPase activity. In the absence of K+, the turnover of the phosphoenzyme was 2000 min-1, which is close to the values for other transport ATPases."
https://openalex.org/W1589980560,"Previous studies have demonstrated that primary cultures of cardiac myocytes maintained in a complete serum-free medium contain a precursor to atrial natriuretic factor (ANF-(1-126]. The cultured cells secrete this precursor unless maintained in the presence of glucocorticoids wherein the known circulating form derived from the C-terminal of ANF (ANF-(99-126] is secreted. The present study was designed to determine the fate of the N-terminal region of the ANF precursor during secretion from myocytes maintained in glucocorticoids. A radioimmunoassay (RIA) was developed using synthetic ANF-(1-16); the antiserum demonstrated cross-reactivity toward ANF-(1-126) and ANF-(1-98)-like peptides but did not cross-react with ANF-(99-126). Coupling this RIA with an ANF-(99-126)-specific RIA and reversed phase, size exclusion, and ion exchange high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), it was shown that primary cultures of atrial myocytes maintained in dexamethasone contained ANF-(1-126) and secreted ANF-(99-126) and a peptide that was chromatographically indistinguishable from ANF-(1-98). Isolated perfused rat hearts were also shown by RIA and HPLC to secrete similar peptides. The primary cells were labeled with [35S]methionine, and the secreted N-terminal ANF-related material was immunoprecipitated with the ANF-(1-16) antiserum. HPLC, tryptic peptide mapping, and radiosequencing demonstrated that this peptide possessed an N-terminal structure identical to that of ANF-(1-126). When the cells were labeled with [3H] leucine and the secreted N-terminal ANF-related material was immunoprecipitated and analyzed by tryptic mapping, it was shown to possess labeled tryptic peptides consistent with the structure of ANF-(1-98). Tryptic mapping of [3H]arginine-labeled N-terminal ANF-related material demonstrated the presence of all peptides consistent with the ANF-(1-98) structure, including ANF-(92-98). These studies demonstrate that primary atrial myocytes contain ANF-(1-126) and in the presence of dexamethasone secrete both ANF-(1-98) and ANF-(99-126), the two major circulating forms of the hormone."
https://openalex.org/W1900606865,"The injection of certain antigens into the anterior chamber (AC) of the eye results in the induction of antigen-specific suppressor T cells (Ts cells), which inhibit systemic delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH). We have previously shown that down-regulation by Ts cells after AC injection with 2,4,6-trinitrophenol (TNP)-coupled spleen cells (TNP-Spl) is initiated by the intraocular activation of Ts inducer cells. These cells activate T suppressor-effector cells in the spleen that are responsible for suppressed DTH. With dark- and light-reared mice (Balb/c), we show that visible light has a direct effect on the intraocular T cell reaction that leads to systemic suppression. Our results show that if light is prevented from reaching the eye by dark rearing, by placing light-reared animals in the dark after AC injection, or by closing the eyelids of light-reared animals after AC injection, Ts cells are not activated. We show that light is responsible for establishing conditions in the eye that cause the preferential activation of Ts cells. The intraocular conditions established by light are not developmentally mandated as is visual development, but can be eliminated in adult light-reared animals by placing them in the dark for 18 h after AC injection. These conditions can also be induced in adult dark-reared animals by returning them to the light for just over 24 h before AC injection. These studies have important implications for understanding intraocular immune responses and possibly for the treatment of eye disease."
https://openalex.org/W1551441292,"Abstract We have investigated here the pre-steady state kinetics of sarcoplasmic reticulum ATPase incubated under conditions where significant amounts of Mg.ATP and Ca.ATP coexist, both of them being substrates for the ATPase. We confirmed that these two substrates are independently hydrolyzed by the ATPase, which thus apparently catalyzes Pi production by two simultaneous and separate pathways. External calcium (or the Ca2+/Mg2+ ratio) determines the extent to which Ca2+ or Mg2+ is bound at the phosphorylation site, while internal calcium controls the rate of processing of both the slow, calcium-containing and the fast, magnesium-containing phosphoenzyme. Time-dependent binding of calcium at the catalytic site is correlated with the observed burst of Pi liberation, which therefore results from reequilibration during pre-steady state of magnesium- and calcium-containing phosphoenzyme pools. Independently of direct exchange of metal at the catalytic site, ADP produced by the hydrolysis reaction contributes to reequilibration of these pools through reversal of phosphorylation by the ATP-ADP exchange pathway."

The effect of a range of polyoxyethylene-based detergents on the solubilized Ca2+-ATPase was tested. Decaethylene glycol dodecyl ether (C12E10) supported the highest levels of activity, although C12E8 and C12E9 were more routinely used. Arrhenius plots of Ca2+-ATPase activity, where the assays were carried out with the same pH at all temperatures (7.4), showed a region of nonlinearity at 10 degrees C. A very similar plot was obtained when no compensation was made for pH variation with temperature. Both the break in the Arrhenius plot and the activation energies for the scallop sarcoplasmic reticulum above and below the break were very similar to those found for lobster sarcoplasmic reticulum (Madeira, V. M. C., Antunes-Madeira, M. C., and Carvalho, A. R. (1974) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 65, 997-1003). The Arrhenius plot of the scallop Ca2+-ATPase in C12E8 no longer showed the nonlinearity at 10-12 degrees C seen with the native sarcoplasmic reticulum, but instead a break now appeared at 20-21 degrees C. This is close to the Arrhenius break temperature of rabbit Ca2+-ATPase in C12E8 and of a perturbation in C12E8 (Dean, W. L. (1982) Biophys. J. 37, 56-57)."
https://openalex.org/W1576454520,"Phosphofructokinase from the flight muscle of bumblebee was purified to homogeneity and its molecular and catalytic properties are presented. The kinetic behavior studies at pH 8.0 are consistent with random or compulsory-order ternary complex. At pH 7.4 the enzyme displays regulatory behavior with respect to both substrates, cooperativity toward fructose 6-phosphate, and inhibition by high concentration of ATP. Determinations of glycolytic intermediates in the flight muscle of insects exposed to low and normal temperatures showed statistically significant increases in the concentrations of AMP, fructose 2,6-bisphosphate, and glucose 6-phosphate during flight at 25 degrees C or rest at 5 degrees C. Measuring the activity of phosphofructokinase and fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase at 25 and 7.5 degrees C, in the presence of physiological concentrations of substrates and key effectors found in the muscle of bumblebee kept under different environmental temperatures and activity levels, suggests that the temperature dependence of fructose 6-phosphate/fructose 1,6-bisphosphate cycling may be regulated by fluctuation of fructose 2,6-bisphosphate concentration and changes in the affinity of both enzymes for substrates and effectors. Moreover, in the presence of in vivo concentrations of substrates, phosphofructokinase is inactive in the absence of fructose 2,6-bisphosphate."
https://openalex.org/W1597761135,"Erythrocyte membranes from goat contain a considerable amount, more than 10% of the total amount, of a glycoprotein with Mr = 155,000 (gp155) on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide electrophoresis gel. This report describes the first isolation and characterization of gp155. This gp155 has major trypsin-sensitive sites at each side of the plasma membrane to generate membrane-bound fragments, indicating that the gp155 spans the lipid bilayer several times. This protein consists of a single polypeptide containing about 1,200 amino acid residues corresponding to Mr = 134,000 and some complex type N-linked oligosaccharide chains. A fraction (15-20%) of the gp155 is recovered in nonionic detergent-extracted ghosts along with 25-30% of band 3 and other cytoskeletal proteins and is completely released into solution by extraction with 1 M KCl. Immunoprecipitation with anti-gp155 and anti-ankyrin antibodies of detergent-solubilized membranes separated on a gel permeation chromatography column showed that a part of the gp155 is tightly linked to band 3 with a molar ratio of 1:2 to 1:3. This gp155-band 3 complex in turn is associated to ankyrin through the binding of band 3 to ankyrin. These data indicate that, in native erythrocyte membranes, as well as in detergent solution, gp155 could play a physiological role in controlling cellular integrity and elasticity by forming the gp155-band 3-ankyrin complex. Partial amino acid sequences of the tryptic peptides are also determined."

The product D-fructose 2,6-[2-16O,17O,18O]bisphosphate was then used as substrate in the alkaline phosphatase-mediated transfer of the phospho groups to (S)-butane-1,3-diol, where the configuration at phosphorus has been determined. Although there was approximately equal transfer by alkaline phosphatase of the labeled 2- and the unlabeled 6-phospho groups, the subsequent assignment of configuration of the chiral phospho group from the 2-position was unambiguous. It was found that 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase proceeds by a pathway that results in net inversion of the configuration at phosphorus. The simplest interpretation of this result is that the phospho group is transferred directly between substrates in a ternary complex by an in-line mechanism not involving a phosphoenzyme intermediate. This conclusion is consistent with the fact that the enzyme cannot be labeled by [gamma-32P]ATP and with steady-state kinetic data that suggest an ordered sequential mechanism. This finding also indicates that the adenine nucleotide and sugar phosphate isotope exchange reactions catalyzed by the enzyme are not relevant to the normal catalytic pathway of the kinase."
https://openalex.org/W1534877149,"Lipocortin 1 is a steroid-induced, calcium-regulated membrane binding protein (Mr = 39,000) which is a substrate for the epidermal growth factor receptor kinase in intact cells. Using a polyclonal antibody to human recombinant lipocortin 1, we have identified a 170-kDa phosphoprotein in freshly isolated rat hepatocytes which shares antigenic determinants with lipocortin 1. The protein was recognized by four different anti-lipocortin 1 antisera, and antibody binding was inhibited by a 100-fold molar excess of human recombinant lipocortin 1 over antibody. Based on Coomassie Blue staining, the 170-kDa lipocortin-related protein is abundant (approximately 100 ng/10(6) cells) in rat liver, while lipocortin 1 itself is found in very low amounts. Epidermal growth factor and insulin stimulated phosphorylation of this 170-kDa protein in intact rat hepatocytes. The increase in phosphorylation was more pronounced in hepatocytes from dexamethasone-treated animals. The phosphorylation occurred exclusively on serine residues and was maximal 30-60 min after hormone addition. The 170-kDa protein was localized in the cytoplasm in the absence of calcium, while increasing calcium concentration led to partial association with the membrane compartment in rat liver. This 170-kDa protein represents a new member of the class of proteins whose serine phosphorylation is regulated by insulin and EGF and may belong to the family of lipocortin-related molecules."
https://openalex.org/W1676873016,"Nuclear magnetic resonance studies have revealed the importance of arginine residues in the actin-myosin interface (Moir, A. J. G., and Levine, B. A. (1986) J. Inorg. Chem. 27, 271-278). In the present study, we tested the involvement of these residues in the rigor complex between actin and subfragment-1 (S1) by chemical cross-linking experiments using phenyldiglyoxal. Two kinds of linkages were observed, one within the S1 heavy chain itself (120-kDa product) and the other between actin and the S1 heavy chain (200-kDa product). The phenyldiglyoxal had an effect similar to that of phenylglyoxal on S1 ATPase activities. We also show that phenyldiglyoxal (of 0.6-0.8 nm arm length) cross-links an arginine residue of the 50-kDa domain to one in the 20-kDa domain of the S1 heavy chain in the absence of actin or to an arginine in actin when actin is present. The presence of Mg2+, adenosine 5'-diphosphate or 5'-adenylyl imidodiphosphate suppressed the intermolecular linkage with actin, and favored the intramolecular cross-link, (i.e. between 50-kDa and 20-kDa fragments). We propose that the same arginyl residue in the N-terminal part of the 50-kDa domain can be cross-linked to a nearby arginine in either the 20-kDa domain or the actin molecule. In accordance with the amino acid sequence of each protein this also implies that the actin-myosin interaction involves arginine residues located either after residue 28 of the N-terminal part of actin, since this actin region is devoid of arginine residues, or in the N-terminal portion of the 50-kDa domain, i.e. between residues 239 and 455."

Receptor complexes were identified on mouse cell lines which express IL-1 receptors by affinity cross-linkage of the radiolabeled ligands, IL-1-alpha or IL-1-beta. Soluble IL-1 or IL-1 nonspecifically associated with membranes of cells which do not express IL-1 receptors was not immunoprecipitated. It is apparent, thus, that antibodies present in the xenogeneic antiserum could specifically bind to the IL-1 receptor moiety within the complex. The major proportion of IL-1 receptor complexes that were reproducibly immunoprecipitated had a molecular weight of 97,000. Cell membrane associated receptors for the monokine, tumor necrosis factor, were not immunoprecipitated.

The truncated products were translated from RNA transcripts without a stop codon. It is demonstrated that the translated products contain an associated ribosome, and the associated ribosome is essential for the posttranslational translocation phenomenon. Also, it is demonstrated that binding of Inv262 to microsomal vesicles made from the cell wall-less mutant of Neurospora crassa does not require the hydrolysis, or the presence, of a nucleoside triphosphate. However, the posttranslational translocation across the membrane, as monitored by glycosylation of the translocated polypeptide chain, does. The data suggest that a nucleoside triphosphatase activity is associated with the translocation of invertase across the membrane. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that binding, and subsequent translocation across the membrane, is dependent on trypsin-sensitive membrane component(s)."
https://openalex.org/W1547278546,"Effects of 3,3',4',5-tetrachlorosalicylanilide (TCS), a lipophilic weak acid, on Ca2+ uptake and ATP hydrolysis by the sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium pump were characterized to obtain insight into the possible role of hydrophobic portions of the Ca2+-ATPase in the catalytic mechanism of the enzyme. TCS exhibited both the stimulatory and inhibitory effects on the calcium pump activities depending on its concentration. At optimal concentrations, it increased these activities by up to 5-fold at pH 7.0 and 6 degrees C. Analysis of partial reactions of ATP hydrolysis by the purified ATPase revealed that TCS accelerated Ca2+ release from the ADP-sensitive phosphoenzyme up to 6-fold, whereas it affected other reaction steps to a much less extent, indicating that the site of the stimulatory action of TCS is rather specific in terms of the reaction sequence. These effects of TCS became less prominent at higher temperatures, although the enzyme-TCS interactions as detected in the direct binding experiment or by measurement of quenching of protein fluorescence were not affected by a similar change in temperature. The TCS effects were also dependent on pH of the 8.0 suggested that the protonated form of TCS is responsible for both the stimulatory and inhibitory effects of the drug. These results, taken together with those obtained previously with a spin-labeled probe (Barratt, M. D., and Weaver, A. C. (1979) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 555, 337-348), may suggest that TCS stimulates the calcium pump activity through its effect on the lipid bilayer, although its direct action on hydrophobic portion(s) of the ATPase protein cannot be ruled out."
https://openalex.org/W1660467335,"Abstract The influence of the bacteriophage phi X174 (phi X) C protein on the replication of bacteriophage phi X174 DNA has been examined. This small viral protein, which is required for the packaging of phi X DNA into proheads, inhibits leading strand DNA synthesis. The inhibitory effect of the phi X C protein requires a DNA template bearing an intact 30-base pair (bp) phi X origin of DNA replication that is the target site recognized by the phi X A protein. Removal of nucleotides from the 3' end of this 30-bp conserved origin sequence prevents the inhibitory effects of the phi X C protein. Leading strand replication of supercoiled DNA substrates containing the wild-type phi X replication origin results in the production of single-stranded circular DNA as well as the formation of small amounts of multimeric and sigma structures. These aberrant products are formed when the termination and reinitiation steps of the replication pathway reactions are skipped as the replication fork moves through the origin sequence. Replication carried out in the presence of the phi X C protein leads to a marked decrease in these aberrant structures. While the exact mechanism of action of the phi X C protein is not clear, the results presented here suggest that the phi X C protein slows the movement of the replication fork through the 30-bp origin sequence, thereby increasing the fidelity of the termination and reinitiation reactions. In keeping with the requirement for the phi X C protein for efficient packaging of progeny phi X DNA into proheads, the phi X C protein-mediated inhibition of leading strand synthesis is reversed by the addition of proteins essential for phi X bacteriophage formation. Incubation of plasmid DNA substrates bearing mutant 30 base pair phi X origin sequences in the complete packaging system results in the in vitro packaging and production of infectious particles in a manner consistent with the replication activity of the origin under study."
https://openalex.org/W1577502443,"Abstract phi X174 viral strand circular DNA can be synthesized in vitro from phi X174 replicative form I (RFI) DNA in the presence of the phi X A protein, the Escherichia coli DNA polymerase III elongation system, the E. coli rep helicase, and the E. coli single-stranded DNA binding protein. M13mp9 or pBR322 RFI DNAs containing a 30-base pair sequence found at the phi X origin of replication supported phi X A protein synthesis as well as the phi X template, giving rise to a net molar excess of deoxynucleotide incorporation. In this paper, we show that mutations in positions 1-3 of the 30-nucleotide origin replicated at a lower efficiency than plasmids containing the wild-type origin, because of a deficiency in the reinitiation reaction. Mutations in positions 4-7, upstream of the phi X A protein cleavage site, failed to support replication because of their inability to support nicking. An origin containing a mutation at the residue to which the phi X A protein is covalently linked to the DNA was an active template that supported a net molar excess of incorporation. Mutations at the 3' end of the origin region, retaining only the first 21-25 nucleotides of the 30-base pair origin, failed to support replication because of impaired binding of the phi X A protein to the template and consequently poor nicking. A construct bearing the first 28 nucleotides of the origin supported wild-type replication, as did a plasmid containing a 28-mer origin with a point mutation at position 26, but this latter construct also appeared to be partially deficient in phi X A protein binding activity. These results are consistent with the presence of a phi X A protein binding domain at the 3' end of the origin."

RFI DNA containing this transversion was cleaved to RFII by the phi X A protein as effectively as DNA containing the wild-type origin. The altered duplex DNA, however, supported replication at a slower rate (3- to 4-fold) than the wild-type DNA due to a defect in the termination and reinitiation reactions catalyzed by the phi X A protein. This defect resulted in the accumulation of DNA products containing long single strands covalently joined to the mutant DNA. These single strands were susceptible to nuclease S1 and exonuclease VII attack. The defect in the template DNA containing C----G transversion was not corrected when this mutant origin was placed on the same strand with a wild-type origin. This double-origin DNA was also replicated poorly and led to the accumulation of large products, in contrast to the products formed with RFI DNA containing two wild-type 30-base pair replication origins on the same strand."

Additional double origin plasmids were utilized to determine whether origins defective in the initial nicking event (initiation) could support circularization (termination). In all cases tested, the presence of a mutant origin on the same strand with a wild-type origin affected the level of replication in a manner consistent with the previously determined activity of the mutant origin. When a functional mutant origin was present on the same strand as a wild-type origin, the efficiency of replication and the DNA products formed were almost identical to those of the plasmid containing two wild-type origins. Plasmid DNA bearing both a wild-type origin and a mutant origin that did not support phi X A protein binding or nicking activity, on the other hand, supported efficient DNA synthesis of only full-length circular products, indicating that the origin defective for initiation was incapable of supporting termination. In contrast, the presence of a wild-type origin and an origin that did bind the phi X A protein but was not cleaved resulted in a marked decrease in DNA synthesis along with the production of only full-length products. This suggests that the phi X A protein stalls when it encounters a sequence to which it can bind but cannot cleave. Replication of double origin plasmids containing one functional phi X origin on each strand of the supercoiled DNA was also examined. With such templates, synthesis from the wild-type origin predominated, indicating preferential cleavage of the intact origin sequence. Replication of such substrates also produced a number of aberrant structures, the properties of which suggested that interstrand exchange of the phi X A protein had occurred."

We demonstrated first that this antiserum contains antibodies directed against IL-1 receptors. We have now successfully used this antiserum as a reagent to immunopurify polysomes along with their messenger RNA from a murine leukemic cell line known to express relatively high levels of IL-1 receptors. The immunoselected mRNA was translated into proteins in vitro. The translation products contained an IL-1 binding protein which could specifically bind to immobilized IL-1 but not to other immobilized ligands such as interleukin-2 or tumor necrosis factor-alpha. The translation products which bound to IL-1 could be acid-eluted from the immobilized ligand, and the proteins released could still specifically bind to IL-1 in a receptor-ligand binding reaction. The eluted IL-1 binding proteins, as well as soluble receptor-ligand complexes derived from them, could also be immunoprecipitated with the xenogeneic rat antiserum. The xenogeneic rat antiserum could, furthermore, immunoprecipitate the IL-1 binding proteins from the translated products before ligand was added. The residual translated products no longer interacted with IL-1. We conclude that our antiserum contains antibodies that recognize determinants expressed on the following proteins: on nascent chains of IL-1 binding proteins; on soluble translated IL-1 binding proteins; on soluble complexes of IL-1 binding proteins that had been cross-linked with IL-1 ligand; and on cell surface-associated IL-1 receptors. The translated and unprocessed IL-1 binding proteins have a molecular mass of approximately 52,000-56,000 daltons."
