https://openalex.org/W2001568034,"Mutations in either the TSC1 or TSC2 tumor suppressor gene are responsible for Tuberous Sclerosis Complex. The gene products of TSC1 and TSC2 form a functional complex and inhibit the phosphorylation of S6K and 4EBP1, two key regulators of translation. Here, we describe that TSC2 is regulated by cellular energy levels and plays an essential role in the cellular energy response pathway. Under energy starvation conditions, the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) phosphorylates TSC2 and enhances its activity. Phosphorylation of TSC2 by AMPK is required for translation regulation and cell size control in response to energy deprivation. Furthermore, TSC2 and its phosphorylation by AMPK protect cells from energy deprivation-induced apoptosis. These observations demonstrate a model where TSC2 functions as a key player in regulation of the common mTOR pathway of protein synthesis, cell growth, and viability in response to cellular energy levels."
https://openalex.org/W2008642796,"Plants, compared to animals, exhibit an amazing adaptability and plasticity in their development. This is largely dependent on the ability of plants to form new organs, such as lateral roots, leaves, and flowers during postembryonic development. Organ primordia develop from founder cell populations into organs by coordinated cell division and differentiation. Here, we show that organ formation in Arabidopsis involves dynamic gradients of the signaling molecule auxin with maxima at the primordia tips. These gradients are mediated by cellular efflux requiring asymmetrically localized PIN proteins, which represent a functionally redundant network for auxin distribution in both aerial and underground organs. PIN1 polar localization undergoes a dynamic rearrangement, which correlates with establishment of auxin gradients and primordium development. Our results suggest that PIN-dependent, local auxin gradients represent a common module for formation of all plant organs, regardless of their mature morphology or developmental origin."

https://openalex.org/W2082516237,"Mitochondria are tailored to meet the metabolic and signaling needs of each cell. To explore its molecular composition, we performed a proteomic survey of mitochondria from mouse brain, heart, kidney, and liver and combined the results with existing gene annotations to produce a list of 591 mitochondrial proteins, including 163 proteins not previously associated with this organelle. The protein expression data were largely concordant with large-scale surveys of RNA abundance and both measures indicate tissue-specific differences in organelle composition. RNA expression profiles across tissues revealed networks of mitochondrial genes that share functional and regulatory mechanisms. We also determined a larger “neighborhood” of genes whose expression is closely correlated to the mitochondrial genes. The combined analysis identifies specific genes of biological interest, such as candidates for mtDNA repair enzymes, offers new insights into the biogenesis and ancestry of mammalian mitochondria, and provides a framework for understanding the organelle's contribution to human disease."

https://openalex.org/W2074177924,"The transcription factor NF-kappaB is critical for setting the cellular sensitivities to apoptotic stimuli, including DNA damaging anticancer agents. Central to NF-kappaB signaling pathways is NEMO/IKKgamma, the regulatory subunit of the cytoplasmic IkappaB kinase (IKK) complex. While NF-kappaB activation by genotoxic stress provides an attractive paradigm for nuclear-to-cytoplasmic signaling pathways, the mechanism by which nuclear DNA damage modulates NEMO to activate cytoplasmic IKK remains unknown. Here, we show that genotoxic stress causes nuclear localization of IKK-unbound NEMO via site-specific SUMO-1 attachment. Surprisingly, this sumoylation step is ATM-independent, but nuclear localization allows subsequent ATM-dependent ubiquitylation of NEMO to ultimately activate IKK in the cytoplasm. Thus, genotoxic stress induces two independent signaling pathways, SUMO-1 modification and ATM activation, which work in concert to sequentially cause nuclear targeting and ubiquitylation of free NEMO to permit the NF-kappaB survival pathway. These SUMO and ubiquitin modification pathways may serve as anticancer drug targets."

https://openalex.org/W1999378703,"Several lines of evidence indicate that mitochondria-mediated reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation is a major source of oxidative stress in the cell. Release of cytochrome c from mitochondria is a central event in apoptosis induction and appears to be mediated by ROS. Dissociation of cytochrome c from the IMM, where it is bound to cardiolipin, represents a necessary first step for cytochrome c release. In the present study, the role of ROS and cardiolipin in the release of cytochrome c from rat liver mitochondria was investigated. ROS were produced by mitochondria oxidizing succinate in the nonphosphorylating state. Cytochrome c was quantitated by a new, very sensitive and rapid reverse-phase HPLC method. We found that succinate-supported ROS production resulted in a release of cytochrome c from mitochondria and a parallel loss of cardiolipin content. These effects were directly and significantly correlated and also abolished by ADP, which prevents succinate-mediated ROS production. The ROS-induced cytochrome c release was independent from MPT and appears to involve VDAC. It is suggested that mitochondrial-induced ROS production promotes cytochrome c release from mitochondria by a two-steps process, consisting of the dissociation of this protein from cardiolipin, followed by permeabilization of the outer membrane, probably by interaction with VDAC. The data may help clarify the molecular mechanism underlying the release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria to the cytosol and the role of ROS and cardiolipin in this release."

https://openalex.org/W2061668856,"In chordates, formation of neural tissue from ectodermal cells requires an induction. The molecular nature of the inducer remains controversial in vertebrates. Here, using the early neural marker Otx as an entry point, we dissected the neural induction pathway in the simple embryos of Ciona intestinalis. We first isolated the regulatory element driving Otx expression in the prospective neural tissue, showed that this element directly responds to FGF signaling and that FGF9/16/20 acts as an endogenous neural inducer. Binding site analysis and gene loss of function established that FGF9/16/20 induces neural tissue in the ectoderm via a synergy between two maternal response factors. Ets1/2 mediates general FGF responsiveness, while the restricted activity of GATAa targets the neural program to the ectoderm. Thus, our study identifies an endogenous FGF neural inducer and its early downstream gene cascade. It also reveals a role for GATA factors in FGF signaling."

https://openalex.org/W1977130610,"Gastrulation generates mesoderm and endoderm from embryonic epiblast; soon after, the neural plate is established within the epiblast-both events require FGF signaling. We describe a zinc finger transcriptional activator, Churchill (ChCh), which acts as a switch between different roles of FGF. FGF induces ChCh slowly; this activates Smad-interacting-protein-1 (Sip1), which blocks further induction of the mesoderm markers brachyury and Tbx6L by FGF. ChCh is first expressed as cells stop migrating through the primitive streak, and we show that it regulates cell ingression. We propose a simple mechanism by which FGF sensitizes cells to BMP signals. These results reveal that neural induction requires cessation of mesoderm formation at the midline in addition to the decision between epidermis and neural plate."

https://openalex.org/W2125615956,"Afro-Arabian mammalian communities underwent a marked transition near the Oligocene/Miocene boundary at approximately 24 million years (Myr) ago. Although it is well documented that the endemic paenungulate taxa were replaced by migrants from the Northern Hemisphere, the timing and evolutionary dynamics of this transition have long been a mystery because faunas from about 32 to 24 Myr ago are largely unknown. Here we report a late Oligocene fossil assemblage from Ethiopia, which constrains the migration to postdate 27 Myr ago, and yields new insight into the indigenous faunal dynamics that preceded this event. The fauna is composed of large paenungulate herbivores and reveals not only which earlier taxa persisted into the late Oligocene epoch but also demonstrates that one group, the Proboscidea, underwent a marked diversification. When Eurasian immigrants entered Afro-Arabia, a pattern of winners and losers among the endemics emerged: less diverse taxa such as arsinoitheres became extinct, moderately species-rich groups such as hyracoids continued into the Miocene with reduced diversity, whereas the proboscideans successfully carried their adaptive radiation out of Afro-Arabia and across the world."

https://openalex.org/W2121234826,"Sphingosine-1 phosphate (S1P) and thrombin are agents with profound but divergent effects on vascular endothelial cell (EC) barrier properties. We have previously reported that S1P-induced focal adhesion (FA) remodeling involves interactions between focal adhesion kinase (FAK), paxillin, and G-protein-coupled receptor kinase-interacting proteins GIT1 and GIT2 and suggested a critical involvement of focal adhesions in the EC barrier regulation. In this study, we examined redistribution of FA proteins (FAK, paxillin, GIT1, and GIT2) and site-specific FAK tyrosine phosphorylation in human pulmonary artery endothelial cells stimulated with thrombin. In contrast to S1P, which we have shown to induce peripheral translocation of FA proteins associated with cortical actin ring formation, thrombin caused the redistribution of FA proteins to the ends of the newly formed massive stress fibers. S1P and thrombin induced distinct patterns of FAK site-specific phosphorylation with the FAK Y576 phosphorylation site targeted by SIP challenge and phosphorylation of three FAK sites (Y397, Y576, and Y925) in response to thrombin stimulation. Pharmacological inhibition of Src with Src-specific inhibitor PP2 abolished S1P-induced translocation of FA proteins, cortical actin ring formation, and FAK [Y576] phosphorylation. However, PP2 failed to alter thrombin-induced morphological changes and exhibited only partial inhibition of FAK site-specific tyrosine phosphorylation. These observations highlight the differential mechanisms of focal adhesion protein complex remodeling and FAK activation by S1P and thrombin and link differential FA remodeling to EC barrier regulation."
https://openalex.org/W2045309790,"Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) is a proinflammatory cytokine known to activate macrophages and T cells. In this study, we demonstrate that recombinant MIF delays apoptosis of neutrophils in vitro. MIF action is dose and time dependent as well as specific since it was abolished with a neutralizing anti-MIF antibody. MIF, like G-CSF, delayed cleavage of the proapoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family Bid and Bax in neutrophils, suggesting that MIF inhibits apoptosis pathways proximal to mitochondria activation. Indeed, MIF also prevented release of cytochrome c and Smac from the mitochondria and subsequent activation of the critical effector caspase-3 in these cells. Moreover, we observed increased MIF plasma levels in patients with cystic fibrosis, a heterogeneous recessive genetic disorder associated with bacterial infections and delayed neutrophil apoptosis. In conclusion, MIF is a survival cytokine for human neutrophils, a finding with potential pathologic relevance in infectious diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2060552527,"We identified IFI16 as a BRCA1-associated protein involved in p53-mediated apoptosis. IFI16 contains the Pyrin/PAAD/DAPIN domain, commonly found in cell death-associated proteins. BRCA1 (aa 502-802) interacted with the IFI16 Pyrin domain (aa 1-130). We found that IFI16 was localized in the nucleoplasm and nucleoli. Clear nucleolar IFI16 localization was not observed in HCC1937 BRCA1 mutant cells, but reintroduction of wild-type BRCA1 restored IFI16 nuclear relocalization following IR (ionizing radiation). Coexpression of IFI16 and BRCA1 enhanced DNA damage-induced apoptosis in mouse embryonic fibroblasts from BRCA1 mutant mice expressing wild-type p53, although mutant IFI16 deficient in binding to BRCA1 did not induce apoptosis. Furthermore, tetracycline-induced IFI16 collaborated in inducing apoptosis when adenovirus p53 was expressed in DNA-damaged p53-deficient EJ cells. These results indicate a BRCA1-IFI16 role in p53-mediated transmission of DNA damage signals and apoptosis."

https://openalex.org/W2095195181,"The pathogenesis of chronic disabling inflammatory diseases (CDIDs) is poorly understood. Current concepts that focus on abnormalities of the immune system are, in our view, incomplete. Here we propose that chronic disruption of homeostasis through abnormal neuronal and endocrine host responses to transient inflammatory reactions contributes to the appearance of CDIDs. Coordinated reactions of the supersystems (immune, nervous, endocrine, and reproductive) that maintain homeostasis have been evolutionarily conserved to respond to and eliminate foreign agents over a period of days to a few weeks. If the responses of these supersystems fail to return to normal after elimination of the pathogen, a continuous aggressive immune response is created; this situation can trigger development of CDIDs. Maladaptation of the supersystems during CDIDs has not been evolutionarily conserved but is nevertheless still prevalent because a large proportion of these diseases tend to appear after the reproductive phase. We propose that this integrated systems hypothesis may permit better identification of a patient at risk or in the early stages of developing a CDID such as rheumatoid arthritis and enable more coordinated intervention than is presently attempted."
https://openalex.org/W2052146604,"Mdm2 oncoprotein plays a major role in inhibiting the p53 tumor suppressor protein. Here, we investigate phosphorylation of Mdm2 at serine 407 (S407). S407 is phosphorylated in cells after treatment with camptothecin (CPT) or hydroxyurea, inhibitors of DNA replication. S407 phosphorylation after CPT treatment is induced upon cell cycle arrest during S phase and prevented if entry into S phase of cell cycle is blocked. We found that a major kinase responsible for S407 phosphorylation is ATR, a DNA damage checkpoint protein that induces cell cycle arrest and promotes DNA repair in response to impaired DNA replication; induction of S407 phosphorylation is enhanced after expression of wild-type ATR, while it is inhibited by a dominant-negative form of ATR. Further, S407 is specifically phosphorylated by ATR in vitro. Substitution of S407 with aspartate (S407D), but not with alanine (S407A), promotes nuclear localization of p53. Taken together, our data indicate that S407 phosphorylation of Mdm2 by ATR reduces Mdm2-dependent export of p53 from nuclei to cytoplasm."
https://openalex.org/W2087186743,"Loss of growth control and a marked resistance to apoptosis are considered major mechanisms driving tumour progression. Protein kinases C (PKC) have been shown to be important in the regulation of proliferation and apoptosis. In this report, we investigated the role of the PKC-like kinase PKCmu in the control of these processes in pancreatic adenocarcinoma cells. We demonstrate that in these cells, PKCmu expression strongly correlates with resistance to CD95-induced apoptosis. Inhibition of PKCmu with Goe6983 sensitized resistant cells to CD95-induced apoptosis. In CD95-sensitive Colo357 cells, forced overexpression of PKCmu strongly reduced CD95-mediated apoptosis, an effect that could be reversed by pretreatment with Goe6983. In addition, PKCmu overexpression led to a strongly enhanced cell growth and to a significant increase of telomerase activity. In an attempt to identify the signalling pathways affected by PKCmu, we identified the antiapoptotic proteins c-FLIPL and survivin to be strongly upregulated in PKCmu overexpressing cells. Immunohistochemical analysis of pancreatic tumour tissue of 48 patients and 10 normal pancreatic tissues revealed marked overexpression of PKCmu in tumours. In conclusion, we showed that PKCmu controls proliferative, as well as anti-apoptotic, signalling pathways and therefore plays an important role in acquiring the malignant phenotype of pancreatic tumours."
https://openalex.org/W2030397896,"Cancer treatment is in the need of selective drugs that can interfere specifically with signalling pathways affected during the carcinogenic process. Identification of new potential molecular targets is the key event in the design of new anticancer strategies. Once identified, attempts for the generation of specific molecules to regulate their function can be achieved. The relevance of deregulation of choline kinase (ChoK, E.C. 2.7.1.32) in oncogene-driven cell transformation has been previously demonstrated. Here we provide strong evidence that MN58b, a selective inhibitor of ChoK, is rather specific to this enzyme, with no effect on a variety of oncogene-activated signalling pathways involved in the regulation of cell proliferation. MN58b does not affect MAPKs, PI3K, and other enzymes involved in the regulation of phospholipid metabolism such as phospholipases C, D, and A2, CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase, or diacylglycerol choline-phosphotransferase. Consistent with this specificity, ectopic expression of ChoK resulted in resistance to its inhibitor. Finally, nontransformed cells were able to resume cell proliferation after removal of the drug, while transformed cells were irreversibly affected. These results indicate that inhibition of ChoK is a rather specific strategy for the cytotoxic treatment of transformed cells."
https://openalex.org/W2163075033,"Clinical performance of currently available human skin equivalents is limited by failure to develop perfusion. To address this problem we have developed a method of endothelial cell transplantation that promotes vascularization of human skin equivalents in vivo. Enhancement of vascularization by Bcl-2 overexpression was demonstrated by seeding human acellular dermis grafts with human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) transduced with the survival gene Bcl-2 or an EGFP control transgene, and subcutaneous implantation in immunodeficient mice (n=18). After 1 month the grafts with Bcl-2-transduced cells contained a significantly greater density of perfused HUVEC-lined microvessels (55.0/mm3) than controls (25.4/mm3,P=0.026). Vascularized skin equivalents were then constructed by sequentially seeding the apical and basal surfaces of acellular dermis with cultured human keratinocytes and Bcl-2-transduced HUVEC, respectively. Two weeks after orthotopic implantation onto mice, 75% of grafts (n=16) displayed both a differentiated human epidermis and perfusion through HUVEC-lined microvessels. These vessels, which showed evidence of progressive maturation, accelerated the rate of graft vascularization. Successful transplantation of such vascularized human skin equivalents should enhance clinical utility, especially in recipients with impaired angiogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2085723125,"Nitric oxide (NO) is produced in mammals by different isoforms of NO synthase (NOS), including the constitutive mitochondrial enzyme (mtNOS). Here we demonstrate that the concentration of NO resulting from a mitochondrial NOS activity increases under hypoxic conditions in isolated rat liver mitochondria. We show that mitochondrially derived NO mediates the impairment of active (state 3) respiration as measured in the presence of the substrates glutamate and malate after reoxygenation. Simultaneously, NO induces oxidative stress in mitochondria, characterized by an increase in the amount of protein carbonyls and a decrease in glutathione (GSH). Both the accumulation of oxidative stress markers during and the impaired respiration after reoxygenation were prevented by blocking NO production with the NOS inhibitor L-NAME. These observations suggest that mitochondria are exposed to high amounts of NO generated by a mitochondrial NOS upon hypoxia/reoxygenation. Such increased NO levels, in turn, inhibit mitochondrial respiration and may cause oxidative stress that leads to irreversible impairment of mitochondria."

https://openalex.org/W2169175478,"Transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) plays complex roles in carcinogenesis, as it may exert both tumor suppressor and pro-oncogenic activities depending on the stage of the tumor. SMAD proteins transduce signals from the TGF-β receptors to regulate the transcription of specific target genes. Crosstalks with other signaling pathways may contribute to the specificity of TGF-β effects. In this report, we have investigated the effects of cyclic adenosine 3′,5′-monophosphate (cAMP), a key second messenger in the cellular response to various hormones, on SMAD-dependent signaling in human HaCaT keratinocytes. Using either an artificial SMAD3/4-dependent reporter construct or the natural TGF-β target, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, we show that membrane-permeable dibutyryl cAMP, and other intracellular cAMP-elevating agents such as the phosphodiesterase inhibitor isobutyl-methylxanthine, the adenylate cyclase activator forskolin, or exogenous prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), interfere with TGF-β-induced SMAD-specific gene transactivation. Inhibition of protein kinase A (PKA), the main downstream effector of cAMP, with H-89, suppressed cAMP-dependent repression of SMAD-driven gene expression. Inversely, coexpression of either an active PKA catalytic subunit or that of the cAMP response element (CRE)-binding protein (CREB) blocked SMAD-driven gene transactivation. cAMP-elevating agents did not inhibit nuclear translocation and DNA binding of SMAD3/4 complexes, but abolished the interactions of SMAD3 with the transcription coactivators CREB-binding protein (CBP) and p300 in a PKA-dependent manner. These results suggest that suppression of TGF-β/SMAD signaling and resulting gene transactivation by cAMP-inducing agents occurs via PKA-dependent, CREB-mediated, disruption of SMAD–CBP/p300 complexes."
https://openalex.org/W1996453930,"Nuclear factor-kappaB essential modulator (NEMO), also called IKKgamma, has been proposed as a 'universal' adaptor of the I-kappaB kinase (IKK) complex for stimuli such as proinflammatory cytokines, microbes, and the HTLV-I Tax oncoprotein. Currently, it remains unclear whether the many signals that activate NF-kappaB through NEMO converge identically or differently. We have adopted two approaches to answer this question. First, we generated and targeted intracellularly three NEMO-specific monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). These mAbs produced two distinct intracellular NF-kappaB inhibition profiles segregating TNFalpha from Tax activation. Second, using NEMO knockout mouse fibroblasts and 10 NEMO mutants, we found that different regions function in trans either to complement or to inhibit dominantly TNFalpha, IL-1beta, or Tax activation of NF-kappaB. For instance, NEMO (1-245 amino acids) supported Tax-mediated NF-kappaB activation, but did not serve TNFalpha- or IL-1beta signaling. Altogether, our findings indicate that while NEMO 'universally' adapts numerous NF-kappaB activators, it may do so through separable domains. We provide the first evidence that selective targeting of NEMO can abrogate oncogenic Tax signaling without affecting signals used for normal cellular metabolism."

https://openalex.org/W2123303572,"B-cell lymphoma gene (BCL-6) upregulation contributes to immortalization of mouse embryo fibroblast and primary B cells via upregulation of cyclin D1. As cyclin D1 overexpression is a common phenomenon in different cancers, BCL-6 protein overexpression may not be restricted to lymphomas. In this study, expression of BCL-6 was investigated by immunohistochemistry on paraffin-embedded specimens from 150 breast cancer patients and 10 specimens of normal breast tissue. The results showed BCL-6 overexpression (> or =10% of cells) in 24/150 (16%) breast cancer patients, whereas in normal breast low expression (<1%) of BCL-6 was observed. In linear regression analysis BCL-6 expression was associated with cyclin D1 (r=0.197, P=0.016). Further, in chi2 analyses, BCL-6-positivity was associated with overexpression of p53 (P=0.016), and hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha (P<0.001). Involvement of BCL-6 in breast carcinogenesis is further underscored by comparative genomic hybridization analysis that showed gains at the BCL-6 locus (3q27) in 14/86 (16%) breast cancer tissues. The cases with amplification in BCL-6 showed an increased (25%) incidence of BCL-6 protein overexpression. Thus, this study is the first to show that BCL-6 oncogene activation plays a role in cancers other than lymphomas."

https://openalex.org/W2014268420,"Vimentin exhibits a complex pattern of developmental- and tissue-specific expression. Since it is aberrantly expressed in metastatic tumors, which have progressed through the epithelial-mesenchymal transition, it has been cited as a marker for tumor progression. Previous studies have indicated that the transcription factor activator protein (AP1) is important in tumor progression. The stable transformation of the MCF7 cell line with the oncogene c-Jun resulted in a cell line (MCF7Jun), which displayed a change in morphology, enhanced migratory and invasive properties, and metastatic behavior. Of the 21 genes whose expression levels were altered in the MCF7Jun cell line, the greatest change in expression occurred for the vimentin gene. Previously, tandem AP1 sites in the promoter were reported to be important for the serum and TPA inducibility of the vimentin gene. However, we find that the AP1 elements only contribute in part to c-Jun activation. Moreover, this activation can be duplicated in COS-1 or S2 cells by expression of c-Jun or TAM67, and is dependent only on the leucine-zipper region of c-Jun. Transient transfection analyses, electrophoretic mobility shift assays, DNA precipitation assays, and coimmunoprecipitation studies suggest that c-Jun is able to synergize with the activator protein Sp1 in binding to GC-box1 to enhance vimentin gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W2090369846,"Isolevuglandins (isoLGs) are a family of reactive gamma-ketoaldehydes generated by free radical oxidation of arachidonate-containing lipids through the isoprostane pathway. Elevated plasma levels of isoLG protein adducts are observed in subjects with atherosclerosis compared with age/gender-matched controls. However, mechanisms for the generation of isoLGs in vivo are not established. Here we show that free radical-induced peroxidation promoted by the myeloperoxidase (MPO)/H2O2 system of leukocytes serves as one mechanism for the generation of isoLGs in vivo. Using a Candida sepsis model of inflammation, we demonstrate 3.5- and 2.7-fold increases in iso[4]LGE2 and isoLGE2 adducts of plasma proteins after pathogen exposure in wild-type mice. Plasma levels of F2 isoprostanes were not significantly increased after pathogen challenge in this model. MPO knockout mice demonstrated significant reductions (34%, P=0.003) in plasma levels of iso[4]LGE2 protein adducts after pathogen challenge compared with wild-type mice. Mass spectrometry and immunochemical methods demonstrate MPO-dependent formation of iso[4]LGE2 and isoLGE2 phospholipids and their corresponding isoLG protein adducts in model systems. The present studies thus identify MPO as one pathway for generation of isoLGs in vivo. They also suggest that long-lived protein isoLG adducts may serve as an alternative integrated sensor of oxidant stress in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2041837975,"Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is the fifth most frequent cancer in the US. Several genetic and epigenetic alterations are associated with HNSCC tumorigenesis, including inactivation of CDKN2A, which encodes the p16 tumor suppressor, in cell lines and primary tumors by DNA methylation. Reactivation of tumor suppressor genes by DNA-demethylating agents and histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors shows therapeutic promise for other cancers. Therefore, we investigated the ability of these agents to reactivate p16 in Tu159 HNSCC cells. Treatment of cells with 5-aza-2'deoxycytidine (5-aza-dC) increases CDKN2A expression and slightly increases histone H3 acetylation at this gene. No reactivation of CDKN2A is observed upon treatment with the HDAC inhibitor trichostatin A (TSA), but synergistic reactivation of CDKN2A is observed upon sequential treatment of Tu159 cells with both 5-aza-dC and TSA. Silencing of CDKN2A in Tu159 cells is correlated with increased methylation of histone H3 at lysine 9 and decreased methylation at lysine 4 relative to the upstream p15 gene promoter. Interestingly, global levels of H3-K9 methylation are decreased upon treatment with 5-aza-dC. Together these data indicate that DNA methylation is a dominant epigenetic mark for silencing of CDKN2A in Tu159 tumor cells. Moreover, changes in DNA methylation can reset the histone code by impacting multiple H3 modifications."
https://openalex.org/W2037757135,"Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) plays an important role in the pathogenesis of myocardial infarction. Stem cells are able to regenerate infarcted myocardium. This study investigated whether TNF-alpha was able to induce migration of embryonic stem cells (ESCs) in vitro. We used a Transwell assay in which neonatal rat cardiomyocytes, with or without transfection of TNF-alpha cDNA, were plated in the lower compartments and mouse ESCs tagged with green fluorescent protein were added to the upper compartments. TNF-alpha level was significantly increased in the medium of the lower compartments seeded with TNF-alpha-transfected cardiomyocytes. Compared with the controls, overexpression of TNF-alpha significantly enhanced migration of ESCs to the lower compartments. This enhancement was attenuated by preincubation of ESCs with the antibody against the type II TNF-alpha receptor (TNF-RII), but not by the antibody against the type I TNF-alpha receptor (TNF-RI). Western blot analysis showed that the phosphorylated protein levels of p38 and c-Jun amino-terminal kinase (JNK) were significantly increased in TNF-alpha-treated ESCs. Inhibition of the activity of p38 or JNK significantly attenuated TNF-alpha-induced ESC migration. Our data demonstrate that excessive TNF-alpha stimulates TNF-RII and enhances migration of ESCs in vitro. Activation of p38 and JNK is required for TNF-alpha-enhanced ESC migration."
https://openalex.org/W1990076643,"SIAH-1 and SIAH-2 are the human members of an evolutionary highly conserved E3 ligase family. SIAH-1 is a p53 and p21Waf−1/Cip−1 induced gene during apoptosis and tumor suppression. In stable-transfected clones of MCF-7 cells, SIAH-1 overexpression was associated with apoptosis, mitotic alterations and p21Waf−1/Cip−1 induction of expression. Using a two-hybrid screening, we identified here the transcriptional corepressor CtBP-interacting protein (CtIP) as a SIAH-1-interacting protein. CtIP has been proposed as a regulator of p21Waf−1/Cip−1 gene transcription through a protein complex involving BRCA1. We demonstrate that SIAH-1 associates with CtIP both in vitro and in vivo. This interaction led to CtIP degradation by the ubiquitin–proteasome pathway. As expected, SIAH-1 induced p21Waf−1/Cip−1 transcription in Jurkat-T cell. Surprisingly, a SIAH protein deleted of its RING finger, SIAH-1ΔN, which is able to interact with CtIP but does not promote its degradation, also induced transcription from the p21Waf−1 promoter in a similar extent as did SIAH-1. Our results suggest that p21Waf−1/Cip−1 induction by SIAH-1 could not be mediated by CtIP degradation."

Chfr was recently defined as a central component of a new mitotic checkpoint that delays chromosome condensation in response to mitotic stress. Chfr was shown to be frequently inactivated in several human neoplasms, including colon, lung and esophageal cancers. To test whether Chfr inactivation may lead or participate to chromosomal instability (CIN), we analysed the genetic and epigenetic status of the gene in a large panel of primary colon and breast cancers, as well as in colon and breast cancer cell lines displaying either a microsatellite instability or a CIN. Our results confirm that Chfr is frequently inactivated in colon cancers, through a mechanism of hypermethylation of the promoter sequences. In contrast, the loss of Chfr expression appears to be a rare event in breast cancers. Furthermore, our data demonstrate that Chfr inactivation is not associated with CIN in these frequent types of human cancers."
https://openalex.org/W2081774718,"Although there is no current evidence for ras gene mutation in choroidal melanoma, there is an increasing body of evidence indicating that deregulated intracellular signalling pathways are involved in choroidal melanoma pathogenesis. The various components of the linear Raf/MEK/ERK signalling pathway have been implicated in various tumours. We therefore investigated the role of Raf-1 and the MEK/ERK module in the proliferation of human normal choroidal melanocytes (NCM) and cells from the ocular choroidal melanoma (OCM-1) cell line. OCM-1 cells proliferated four times faster than NCM. High basal activation of the MEK/ERK module was observed in unstimulated OCM-1 cells, whereas rapid and persistent activation was detected after serum stimulation, throughout the 24-h period of culture. In contrast, the activation of MEK/ERK was barely detectable in unstimulated NCM and occurred late (6 h) after the stimulation of cell proliferation. Inhibition of Raf-1 and MEK1/2 activation by pharmacological approaches and of the production of Raf-1 and ERK1/2 by antisense oligonucleotide approaches demonstrated that Raf-1 and the MEK/ERK module controlled proliferation in OCM-1 cells, but not in NCM. OCM-1 cells produced very low levels of p27Kip1, whereas NCM produced constant, high levels of p27Kip1. The inhibition of Raf-1 or MEK1/2 induced a large increase in p27Kip1 in OCM-1 cells, associated with an arrest of cell proliferation. Levels of c-Myc production were high and constant in OCM-1 cells and low in NCM, in contrast to what was observed for p27Kip1. The inhibition of both Raf-1 and MEK1/2 induced a decrease in c-Myc production and downregulated c-Myc activity by preventing c-Myc phosphorylation in OCM-1 cells. We conclude that Raf-1 and the MEK/ERK module control the production of both p27Kip1 and c-Myc, and the activation of c-Myc for OCM-1 cell proliferation."

We have discovered that a preaxial form of polydactyly, in which extra digits are positioned anterior to the first digit, has unexpectedly re-emerged in a marine reptile from the Early Triassic period about 242 million years ago — the overall morphology of both the manus and pes closely resemble those of the earliest tetrapods. Until now, no post-Devonian tetrapod has been found with a comparative type of polydactyly, so the new amniote provides a striking example of convergent evolution."
https://openalex.org/W1984804608,"Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase activity is essential for the pathogenesis of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). A number of Bcr-Abl substrates have been identified, but it is not clear which of these substrates are required for Bcr-Abl to transform cells. The multifunctional protein c-Cbl is one of the most prominently tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins in Bcr-Abl-expressing cells. Using cell lines and mice with homozygous disruption of the c-CBL locus, we investigated the role of this protein for Bcr-Abl-driven transformation. We find that although c-Cbl−/− fibroblast cell lines show a deficit in Bcr-Abl transformation compared to wild-type (Wt) cells, this deficit was less pronounced in c-Cbl−/− B cells derived from murine bone marrow. Most importantly, in a transplantation model of CML, Bcr-Abl was capable of inducing fatal leukemia in mice in the absence of c-Cbl protein. Our results indicate that c-Cbl is dispensable for Bcr-Abl-induced leukemogenesis in mice."
https://openalex.org/W1979855528,"Activation of CD4 T cells by antigen-presenting cells is required for the full expression of most autoimmune diseases and allogeneic transplant rejection. The extracellular part of CD4 molecule is composed of four domains, D1-D4. CD4 binds to MHC class II via its D1 and D2 domains. Pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP) binds very tightly to the D1 domain of CD4 and therefore could interfere with proper CD4-MHC II interaction. Nonincorporation of CD4 into the activation complex can result in T cell apoptosis and anergy to autoantigen (s). Occupancy of D1 by PLP may prevent the proper protein-protein interactions of the CD4 molecule itself, which are important in T cell activation. PLP may also interfere with the dimerization of CD4 molecules, which occurs during T cell activation, or with the interaction of this dimer with other molecules on the T cell surface, such as CD45, thereby further rendering T cells anergic or driven to apoptosis. Therefore, PLP may have utility in the treatment of autoimmunity and transplant rejection. Furthermore, as the interaction of the HIV gp120 and CD4 occurs via D1, PLP is supposed to have anti-HIV effect as well. PLP may prove of special utility in the treatment of patients affected with both autoimmunity and HIV, for whom the routine immunosuppressives are contraindicated."
