https://openalex.org/W2902449171,"Arabidopsis thaliana (Arabidopsis) increases in freezing tolerance in response to low nonfreezing temperatures, a phenomenon known as cold acclimation. The CBF regulatory pathway, which contributes to cold acclimation, includes three genes-CBF1, CBF2 and CBF3-encoding closely-related transcription factors that regulate the expression of more than 100 genes-the CBF regulon-that impart freezing tolerance. Here we compare the CBF pathways of two Arabidopsis ecotypes collected from sites in Sweden (SW) and Italy (IT). Previous studies showed that the SW ecotype was more freezing tolerant than the IT ecotype and that the IT ecotype had a nonfunctional CBF2 gene. Here we present results establishing that the difference in CBF2 alleles contributes to the difference in freezing tolerance between the two ecotypes. However, other differences in the CBF pathway as well as CBF-independent pathways contribute the large majority of the difference in freezing tolerance between the two ecotypes. The results also provided evidence that most cold-induced CBF regulon genes in both the SW and IT ecotypes are coregulated by CBF-independent pathways. Additional analysis comparing our results with those published by others examining the Col-0 accession resulted in the identification of 44 CBF regulon genes that were conserved among the three accessions suggesting that they likely have important functions in life at low temperature. The comparison further supported the conclusion that the CBF pathway can account for a large portion of the increase in freezing tolerance that occurs with cold acclimation in a given accession, but that CBF-independent pathways can also make a major contribution."

Ribosome biogenesis is central to cellular metabolic regulation, and several diseases are associated with rDNA dysfunction, notably cancer, However, its highly repetitive nature has severely limited characterization of the elements responsible for rDNA function. Here we make use of phylogenetic footprinting to provide a comprehensive list of novel, potentially functional elements in the human rDNA. Complete rDNA sequences for six non-human primate species were constructed using de novo whole genome assemblies. These new sequences were used to determine the conservation profile of the human rDNA, revealing 49 conserved regions in the rDNA intergenic spacer (IGS). To provide insights into the potential roles of these conserved regions, the conservation profile was integrated with functional genomics datasets. We find two major zones that contain conserved elements characterised by enrichment of transcription-associated chromatin factors, and transcription. Conservation of some IGS transcripts in the apes underpins the potential functional significance of these transcripts and the elements controlling their expression. Our results characterize the conservation landscape of the human IGS and suggest that noncoding transcription and chromatin elements are conserved and important features of this unique genomic region."
https://openalex.org/W2902806432,"Asiatic black bears (Ursus thibetanus) have a widespread distribution in mountain landscapes, and are considered vulnerable globally, but are low-priority species for conservation in Nepal. Habitat fragmentation, illegal hunting, and human-bear conflict are the major threats to Asiatic black bears across their global range. Having an adequate level of genetic variation in a population helps with adapting to rapidly changing environments, and thus is important for the long-term health of bear populations. Accordingly, we conducted non-invasive surveys of bear populations in the Annapurna Conservation Area (ACA) to elucidate genetic diversity, genetic structure, and the phylogenetic relationship of Asiatic black bears from this region of Nepal to other subspecies. To assess levels of genetic diversity and population genetic structure, we genotyped eight microsatellite loci using 147 samples, identifying 60 individuals in an area of approximately 525 km2. We found that the Asiatic black bear population in the ACA has maintained high levels of genetic diversity (HE = 0.76) as compared to other bear populations from range countries. We did not detect a signature of population substructure among sampling localities and this suggests that animals are moving freely across the landscape within the ACA. We also detected a moderate population size that may increase with the availability of suitable habitat in the ACA, so bear-related conflict should be addressed to ensure the long-term viability of this expanding bear populations. Primers specific to bears were designed to amplify a 675 bp fragment of the mitochondrial control region from the collected samples. Three haplotypes were observed from the entire conservation area. The complete mitochondrial genome (16,771 bp), the first obtained from wild populations of the Himalayan black bear (U. t. laniger), was also sequenced to resolve the phylogenetic relationships of closely related subspecies of Asiatic black bears. The resulting phylogeny indicated that Himalayan black bear populations in Nepal are evolutionary distinct from other known subspecies of Asiatic black bears."
https://openalex.org/W2902256097,"Background Obesity is a critical public health issue, affecting over one-third of all Americans, and is an underlying cause of numerous health issues across the lifespan. For older adults, obesity is linked to premature declines in physical and mental health and cognitive functioning. The occurrence of obesity and related health behaviors and chronic diseases are higher in rural areas than in urban areas. Furthermore, rural areas of the United States have a higher proportion of older adults than urban areas. Few studies, to date, have explored rural-urban differences in the relationships between dietary patterns and obesity among older adults. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to assess rural-urban differences in obesity rates in older adults, and the potential for the associations between obesity and physical activity and dietary patterns to vary by rural-urban status. Methods Data were abstracted from respondents aged 65 and above from the 2012 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) database linked to Census-based county-level information on rural-urban status and socioeconomic status. Generalized linear models were utilized to assess rural-urban disparities in obesity, and the potential for associations between obesity and known risk factors (fruit consumption, green vegetable consumption and physical activity) to vary by rural-urban status, accounting for complex sampling and confounders. Results Obesity rates were highest and fruit consumption was lowest in the most rural areas. However, for older adults in the most urban areas, there was a significant negative association between obesity and fruit and green vegetable consumption. This association was not observed in more rural older adults. Conclusion These findings underscore the need to take into account place-based factors such as rural-urban status, when designing and implementing policies and interventions designed to reduce obesity through risk factor mitigation in older adults. To reduce rural-urban disparities in older adults, all policies, programs, and interventions should address the unique barriers and needs specific to rural and urban older adults."
https://openalex.org/W2902267136,"Background This paper describes the association between workplace violence and job satisfaction among physicians and nurses in Macau. Convenience sampling was sourced from six health centers under the Macau Health Bureau. Methods This study uses a cross-sectional self-administrative survey. The study used case studies research instruments for workplace violence in the health sector by country (from the ILO, ICN, WHO, PSI), the Minnesota Satisfaction Questionnaire and Perceived Stress Scale. The data collection period spanned from August to December, 2014. Data analysis Multiple logistic regression examines levels of intrinsic and extrinsic satisfaction in physicians and nurses and significant correlates affecting their job satisfaction. Results A total of 720 (14.9% physicians) participants were recruited. 57.2% of participants reported physical and psychological workplace violence in the preceding year. The most common forms of workplace violence were verbal abuse (53.4%), physical assault (16.1%), bullying / harassment (14.2%), sexual harassment (4.6%) and racial harassment (2.6%). Nurses were at a significantly higher risk of physical assault and verbal abuse compared to physicians. Patients, patients’ relatives, and colleagues were the main perpetrators. Worry about WPV, on-call duty and shift work, experience of bullying and verbal abuse and employment sector emerged as significant correlates affecting the intrinsic and extrinsic job satisfaction of physicians and nurses. Frontline staff, aged 30 and 39, coming from an ethnic minority, and perceived stress were significant correlates affecting nurses’ job satisfaction. Conclusions WPV remains a significant concern in healthcare settings in Macau. Stakeholders should legally enforce a zero-tolerance policy towards WPV within healthcare workplaces. WPV is detrimental to healthcare professionals’ mental wellbeing, risking irreversible physical and psychological harm for its victims."
https://openalex.org/W2903398845,"Socioeconomic inequalities are major health determinants. To monitor and understand them at local level, ecological indexes of socioeconomic deprivation constitute essential tools. In this study, we describe the development of the updated version of the European Deprivation Index for Portuguese small-areas (EDI-PT), describe its spatial distribution and evaluate its association with a general health indicator–all-cause mortality in the period 2009–2012. Using data from the 2011 European Union–Statistics on Income and Living Conditions Survey (EU-SILC), we obtained an indicator of individual deprivation. After identifying variables that were common to both the EU-SILC and the census, we used the indicator of individual deprivation to test if these variables were associated with individual-level deprivation, and to compute weights. Accordingly, eight variables were included. The EDI-PT was produced for the smallest area unit possible (n = 18084 census block groups, mean/area = 584 inhabitants) and resulted from the weighted sum of the eight selected variables. It was then categorized into quintiles (Q1-least deprived to Q5-most deprived). To estimate the association with mortality we fitted Bayesian spatial models. The EDI-PT was unevenly distributed across Portugal–most deprived areas concentrated in the South and in the inner North and Centre of the country, and the least deprived in the coastal North and Centre. The EDI-PT was positively and significantly associated with overall mortality, and this relation followed a rather clear dose-response relation of increasing mortality as deprivation increases (Relative Risk Q2 = 1.012, 95% Credible Interval 0.991–1.033; Q3 = 1.026, 1.004–1.048; Q4 = 1.053, 1.029–1.077; Q5 = 1.068, 1.042–1.095). Summing up, we updated the index of socioeconomic deprivation for Portuguese small-areas, and we showed that the EDI-PT constitutes a sensitive measure to capture health inequalities, since it was consistently associated with a key measure of population health/development, all-cause mortality. We strongly believe this updated version will be widely employed by social and medical researchers and regional planners."
https://openalex.org/W2902773593,"The performance of three machine learning methods (support vector regression, random forests and artificial neural network) for estimating the LAI of paddy rice was evaluated in this study. Traditional univariate regression models involving narrowband NDVI with optimized band combinations as well as linear multivariate calibration partial least squares regression models were also evaluated for comparison. A four year field-collected dataset was used to test the robustness of LAI estimation models against temporal variation. The partial least squares regression and three machine learning methods were built on the raw hyperspectral reflectance and the first derivative separately. Two different rules were used to determine the models' key parameters. The results showed that the combination of the red edge and NIR bands (766 nm and 830 nm) as well as the combination of SWIR bands (1114 nm and 1190 nm) were optimal for producing the narrowband NDVI. The models built on the first derivative spectra yielded more accurate results than the corresponding models built on the raw spectra. Properly selected model parameters resulted in comparable accuracy and robustness with the empirical optimal parameter and significantly reduced the model complexity. The machine learning methods were more accurate and robust than the VI methods and partial least squares regression. When validating the calibrated models against the standalone validation dataset, the VI method yielded a validation RMSE value of 1.17 for NDVI(766,830) and 1.01 for NDVI(1114,1190), while the best models for the partial least squares, support vector machine and artificial neural network methods yielded validation RMSE values of 0.84, 0.82, 0.67 and 0.84, respectively. The RF models built on the first derivative spectra with mtry = 10 showed the highest potential for estimating the LAI of paddy rice."
https://openalex.org/W2902338809,"Background Excess sugar consumption, including sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs), contributes to a variety of negative health outcomes, particularly for young people. The mass media play a powerful role in influencing public and policy-makers’ perceptions of public health issues and their solutions. We analysed how sugar and SSB policy debates were presented in UK newspapers at a time of heightened awareness and following the announcement of the UK Government’s soft drinks industry levy (SDIL), to inform future public health advocacy. Methods & findings We carried out quantitative content analysis of articles discussing the issues of sugar and SSB consumption published in 11 national newspapers from April 2015 to November 2016. 684 newspaper articles were analysed using a structured coding frame. Coverage peaked in line with evidence publication, campaigner activities and policy events. Articles predominantly supportive of SSB taxation (23.5%) outnumbered those that were predominantly oppositional (14.2%). However, oppositional articles outnumbered supportive ones in the month of the announcement of the SDIL. Sugar and SSB consumption were presented as health risks, particularly affecting young people, with the actions of industry often identified as the cause of the public health problem. Responsibility for addressing sugar overconsumption was primarily assigned to government intervention. Conclusion Our results suggest that the policy landscape favouring fiscal solutions to curb sugar and SSB consumption has benefited from media coverage characterising the issue as an industry-driven problem. Media coverage may drive greater public acceptance of the SDIL and any future taxation of products containing sugar. However, future advocacy efforts should note the surge in opposition coinciding with the announcement of the SDIL, which echoes similar patterns of opposition observed in tobacco control debates."
https://openalex.org/W2902889201,"Brazil recently began granting timber concessions in public forests to promote sustainable forest use. The effectiveness of this strategy hinges on the design and implementation of the concessions themselves as well as their competitive position within the logging sector as a whole. There is, however, a lack of information on the competitive interaction between legal and illegal logging and its effects on concessions profits. We address this knowledge gap by using a spatially explicit simulation model of the Amazon timber industry to examine the potential impact of illegal logging on timber concessions allocation and profits in a 30-year harvest cycle. In a scenario in which illegal logging takes place outside concessions, including private and public ""undesignated"" lands, concession harvested area would decrease by 59% due to competition with illegal logging. Moreover, 29 out of 39 National Forests (≈74%) would experience a decrease in harvested area. This ""leakage"" effect could reduce concession net rents by up to USD 1.3 Billion after 30 years. Federal and State ""undesignated"" lands, if not adequately protected, could have 40% of their total volume illegally harvested in 30 years. Our results reinforce the need to invest in tackling illegal logging, if the government wants the forest concessions program to be successful."
https://openalex.org/W2903034262,"Plastic food contact materials (FCM)-based products were widely used in everyday life. These products were normally imposed to strict regulations in order to pass the enforcement tests of compliance as a prefix condition. However, even in these ""qualified"" materials, unknown chemical substances, not involving in legislation lists, could migrate from FCM. In this perspective, the present work aims to thoroughly analyze by means of Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) the different substances/migrants in 120 qualified FCM plastic products. Unexpectedly, among the identified compounds (nearly 100), only 13% was included in the permitted list of Commission Regulation EU No 10/2011. All the identified compounds were classified into 11 categories according to their chemical structure and the FCM type, whereas toxicology data were in addition analyzed. Each plastic type exhibited different preferences of chemical migrants. Fortunately, most of the compounds identified were of low toxicity, and only 4 chemicals were included in priority lists and previous literature reports as potential risk factors. Subsequently, the accurate amount of these 4 chemicals was determined. The amount of Bis(2-ethylhexyl) adipate (DEHA) and Bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) were lower than the SML in Commission Regulation EU No 10/2011, and that of stearamide was under the recommended use quantity. The 2,4-di-tert-butylphenol (2,4-DTBP) was widely exist in the investigated FCM products. Among them, the highest level is obtained in polypropylene/low density polyethylene (BOPP/LDPE) materials, up to 45.568±31.513 mg/kg. In summary, a panel of unlisted chemical migrants were discovered and identified by GS-MS screening. The results implied that plastic FCMs were not so ""inert"" as they usually considered, and further safety evaluation should be performed toward the complete identification of new substances in FCM products."
https://openalex.org/W2902920735,"Antenatal care (ANC) is a care given for pregnant women and is a good opportunity to deliver maternal health interventions. Even though pregnant women should start their first antenatal care within 12 weeks of gestational age, many pregnant women start their first ANC late. So, the aim of this study is to determine magnitude of late ANC booking at first visit and factors associated with it.Institutional based cross sectional study design was conducted in central zone of Tigray Region, Ethiopia from November 1/2017 to January 30/2018 among total of 632 pregnant women. Stratified multi stage cluster sampling method was used to select health centers and systematic random sampling technique was used during the selection of study units. Data were collected using interview administer questionnaire by face to face. The collected data were entered into EPI info-7. Later on, it was exported to STATA-14 for further analysis. Proportion was used to estimate the magnitude of late ANC booking. Bivariable and multivariable analysis were done to see factors associated with the magnitude of late ANC booking.The magnitude of late ANC booking at first visit were 85.67% (95%, CI: 82.89, 88.45). Factors that were independently associated with the late ANC booking at first visit in multivariable analysis were; having home delivery in previous delivery (AOR = 2.2, 95%, CI: 1.1, 4.49), women who had no previous ANC follow up (AOR = 3.43, 95%, CI: 1.32, 8.92) and women with poor knowledge about the advantage and service availability of ANC (AOR = 3.9, 95%, CI: 1.83, 8.29).In summary, most of pregnant women were not started their first ANC at the recommended time. Home delivery and history of ANC in previous pregnancy as well as women with poor knowledge about ANC were associated with late ANC booking at first visit. Health workers should work on avoiding home delivery and increasing the knowledge of pregnant women on ANC may help on reducing late ANC booking at first visit."
https://openalex.org/W2889746694,"Introduction Self-compassion refers to a non-evaluative, interconnected and mindful attitude towards oneself especially when facing difficulties or feelings of personal inadequacies. The Self-Compassion Scale (SCS) is a frequently used instrument designed to measure self-compassion either by using the six subscale scores, or by calculating a total score, averaged across all 26 items. Purpose The purpose of this study is to examine the factor structure of the Self-Compassion Scale, and in particular, whether the widely used six-factor model and the unidimensional model can be confirmed. Methods The internal structure of the SCS was examined using confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). Six different models (a one-factor model, an oblique six-factor model, a higher-order model, an oblique two-factor model, a bi-factor model with one general factor (bifactor model) and a bi-factor model with two general factors, i.e. two-bifactor model) were tested in a sample of adolescents (n = 1725; 50.3% female; mean age = 16.56, SD = 1.95). All models were replicated using responses collected five months after the first data collection from 1497 students (W2), who were largely, but not completely, the same students involved in W1 data collection. Results Fit indices for the two-factor model implied an acceptable fit, but none of the remaining models tested met the criteria for an adequate solution. Although the fit indices for the six-factor model suggested an acceptable fit to the data, in this model the negative components of the SCS were highly correlated with each other, especially with the over-identification factor. Conclusion The results of this study provide evidence to support the use of the separate self-compassion- and self-coldness -scores rather than the overall score of the SCS. Although the fit indices supported the six-factor model, the use of six subscale scores cannot be recommended on the basis of our results given the extremely high correlations within this model between some factors."
https://openalex.org/W2902245660,"We aimed to test the hypothesis that determinants of the perinatal clinical exposome related to the underlying etiology of premature birth (PTB) impact differently on select neonatal outcomes. We conducted a prospective longitudinal study of 377 singleton preterm neonates [gestational age (GA) at birth: 23-34 weeks] separated into three distinct contemporaneous newborn cohorts: i) spontaneous PTB in the setting of intra-amniotic infection/inflammation (yes-IAI, n = 116); ii) spontaneous PTB in the absence of IAI (no-IAI, n = 130), and iii) iatrogenic PTB for preeclampsia (iPTB-PE, n = 131). Newborns (n = 372) were followed until death or discharge. Amniotic fluid defensins 1&2 and calgranulins A&C were used as biomarkers of IAI. An algorithm considering cord blood interleukin-6 (IL-6) and haptoglobin (Hp switch-on) was used to assess fetal exposure to IAI. Intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH), periventricular leukomalacia (PVL), necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), retinopathy of prematurity (ROP), early-onset neonatal (EONS) and late-onset (LOS) sepsis, death. Independent risk factors for adverse outcomes were: i) IVH (n = 53): histologic chorioamnionitis, GA, fetal growth restriction, male sex, Hp switch-on; ii) PVL (n = 11): cord blood IL-6; iii) NEC (n = 25), GA; iv) BPD (n = 53): ventilator support, need for surfactant, GA; v) ROP (n = 79): ventilator support, Hp switch-on, GA; vi) fetal and neonatal death (n = 31): GA, amniotic fluid IL-6; vii) suspect EONS (n = 92): GA, Hp switch-on; viii) LOS (n = 81): GA. Our findings are applicable to pregnancies delivered between 23 and 34 weeks' gestation in the setting of IAI and PE, and suggest that GA and inflammatory intrauterine environment play key roles in occurrence of IVH, PVL, ROP, death, EONS and LOS. Postnatal determinants seem to play major role in NEC and BPD."
https://openalex.org/W2902244682,"The malaria parasite replicates within erythrocytes. The pathogenesis of clinical malaria is in large part due to the capacity of the parasite to remodel its host cell. To do this, intraerythrocytic stages of Plasmodium falciparum export more than 300 proteins that dramatically alter the morphology of the infected erythrocyte as well as its mechanical and adhesive properties. P. falciparum plasmepsin V (PfPMV) is an aspartic protease that processes proteins for export into the host erythrocyte and is thought to play a key role in parasite virulence and survival. However, although standard techniques for gene disruption as well as conditional protein knockdown have been previously attempted with the pfpmv gene, complete gene removal or knockdown was not achieved so direct genetic proof that PMV is an essential protein has not been established. Here we have used a conditional gene excision approach combining CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing and DiCre-mediated recombination to functionally inactivate the pfpmv gene. The resulting mutant parasites displayed a severe growth defect. Detailed phenotypic analysis showed that development of the mutant parasites was arrested early in the ring-to-trophozoite transition in the erythrocytic cycle following gene excision. Our findings are the first to elucidate the effects of PMV gene disruption, showing that it is essential for parasite viability in asexual blood stages. The mutant parasites can now be used as a platform to further dissect the Plasmodium protein export pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2902860937,"Altitudinal gradients provide valuable information about the effects of environmental variables on changes in species richness and composition as well as the distribution of below ground fungal communities. Since most knowledge in this respect has been gathered on aboveground communities, we focused our study towards the characterization of belowground fungal communities associated with two different ages of Norway spruce (Picea abies) trees along an altitudinal gradient. By sequencing the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region on the Illumina platform, we investigated the fungal communities in a floristically and geologically relatively well explored forest on the slope of Mt. Iseler of the Bavarian Alps. From fine roots and rhizosphere of a total of 90 of Norway spruce trees from 18 plots we detected 1285 taxa, with a range of 167 to 506 (average 377) taxa per plot. Fungal taxa are distributed over 96 different orders belonging to the phyla Ascomycota, Basidiomycota, Chrytridiomycota, Glomeromycota, and Mucoromycota. Overall the Agaricales (438 taxa) and Tremellales (81 taxa) belonging to the Basidiomycota and the Hypocreales (65 spp.) and Helotiales (61 taxa) belonging to the Ascomycota represented the taxon richest orders. The evaluation of our multivariate generalized mixed models indicate that the altitude has a significant influence on the composition of the fungal communities (p < 0.003) and that tree age determines community diversity (p < 0.05). A total of 47 ecological guilds were detected, of which the ectomycorrhizal and saprophytic guilds were the most taxon-rich. Our ITS amplicon Illumina sequencing approach allowed us to characterize a high fungal community diversity that would not be possible to capture with fruiting body surveys alone. We conclude that it is an invaluable tool for diverse monitoring tasks and inventorying biodiversity, especially in the detection of microorganisms developing very ephemeral and/or inconspicuous fruiting bodies or lacking them all together. Results suggest that the altitude mainly influences the community composition, whereas fungal diversity becomes higher in mature/older trees. Finally, we demonstrate that novel techniques from bacterial microbiome analyses are also useful for studying fungal diversity and community structure in a DNA metabarcoding approach, but that incomplete reference sequence databases so far limit effective identification."
https://openalex.org/W2902027767,"Soil salinization erodes the farmlands and poses a serious threat to human life, reuse of the saline-alkali lands as cultivated resources becomes increasingly prominent. Pacific white shrimp (Litopenaeus vannamei) is an important farmed aquatic species for the development and utilization of the saline-alkali areas. However, little is known about the adaptation mechanism of this species in terms of high-pH stress. In the present study, a transcriptome analysis on the gill tissues of L. vannamei in response to high-pH stress (pH 9.3 ± 0.1) was conducted. After analyzing, the cyclic nucleotide gated channel-Ca2+ (CNGC-Ca2+) and patched 1 (Ptc1) were detected as the majority annotated components in the cAMP signaling pathway (KO04024), indicating that the CNGC-Ca2+ and Ptc1 might be the candidate components for transducing and maintaining the high-pH stress signals, respectively. The immunoglobulin superfamily (IgSF), heat shock protein (HSP), glutathione s-transferase (GST), prophenoloxidase/phenoloxidase (proPO/PO), superoxide dismutase (SOD), anti-lipopolysaccharide factor (ALF) and lipoprotein were discovered as the major transcribed immune factors in response to high-pH stress. To further detect hub regulation-genes, protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks were constructed; the genes/proteins ""Polymerase (RNA) II (DNA directed) polypeptide A"" (POLR2A), ""Histone acetyltransferase p300"" (EP300) and ""Heat shock 70kDa protein 8"" (HSPA8) were suggested as the top three hub regulation-genes in response to acute high-pH stress; the genes/proteins ""Heat shock 70kDa protein 4"" (HSPA4), ""FBJ murine osteosarcoma viral oncogene homolog"" (FOS) and ""Nucleoporin 54kDa"" (NUP54) were proposed as the top three hub regulation-genes involved in adapting endurance high-pH stress; the protein-interactions of ""EP300-HSPA8"" and ""HSPA4-NUP54"" were detected as the most important biological interactions in response to the high-pH stress; and the HSP70 family genes might play essential roles in the adaptation of the high-pH stress environment in L. vannamei. These findings provide the first insight into the molecular and immune basis of L. vannamei in terms of high-pH environments, and the construction of a PPI network might improve our understanding in revealing the hub regulation-genes in response to abiotic stress in shrimp species and might be beneficial for further studies."
https://openalex.org/W2902292350,"Drought is the most significant environmental stress for agricultural production worldwide, and tremendous efforts have been made to improve crop yield under the increasing water scarcity. Transcription factors are major players in the regulation of water stress-related genes in plants. Recently, different MYB transcription factors were characterized for their involvement in drought response. A sugarcane R2R3-MYB gene (ScMYBAS1) and its four alternative forms of transcript (ScMYAS1-2, ScMYBAS1-3, ScMYBAS1-4 and ScMYBAS1-5) were identified in this study. The subcellular localization, in Nicotiniana benthamiana, of the TFs fused in frame with GFP revealed that ScMYBAS1-2-GFP and ScMYBAS1-3-GFP were observed in the nucleus. The overexpression of ScMYBAS1-2 and ScMYBAS1-3 spliced transcripts in rice promoted change in plant growth under both well-watered and drought conditions. The ScMYBAS1-2 and ScMYBAS1-3 transgenic lines revealed a higher relative water content (RWC) compared to the wild type before maximum stress under drought conditions. The ScMYBAS1-2 transgenic lines showed a reduction in biomass (total dry weight). Conversely, ScMYBAS1-3 showed an increased biomass (total dry weight) relative to the wild-type. The overexpression of ScMYBAS1-3 in rice transgenic lines showed involvement with drought tolerance and biomass and, for this reason, was considered a good target for plant transformation, particularly for use in developing genotypes with drought tolerance and biomass accumulation."
https://openalex.org/W2903461246,"Delivering therapeutics across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) for treating central nervous system (CNS) diseases is one of the biggest challenges today as the BBB limits the uptake of molecules greater than 500 Da into the CNS. Here we describe a novel trans-nasal mucosal drug delivery as an alternative to the intranasal drug delivery to overcome its limitations and deliver high molecular weight (HMW) therapeutics efficiently to the brain. This approach is based on human endoscopic skull base surgical techniques in which a surgical defect is repaired by engrafting semipermeable nasal mucosa over a skull base defect. Based on endoscopic skull based surgeries, our groups has developed a trans-nasal mucosal rodent model where we have evaluated the permeability of ovalbumin (45 kDa) as a model protein through the implanted mucosal graft for delivering HMW therapeutics to the brain. A thermo sensitive liposome-in-gel (LiG) system was developed for creating a drug depot allowing for a sustained release from the site of delivery to the brain through the implanted nasal graft. We would like to report this as an exploratory pilot study where we are using this novel surgical model to show that the implanted nasal mucosal graft and the LiG delivery system result in an efficient and a sustained brain delivery of HMW proteins. Hence, this study demonstrates that the trans-nasal mucosal engrafting technique could overcome the limitations for intranasal drug delivery and enable the uptake of HMW protein therapeutics into the CNS for the treatment of a wide range of neurodegenerative diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2902606001,"Objectives Research concentrating on continuity of care for chronic, non-communicable disease (NCD) patients in resource-constrained settings is currently limited and focusses on inpatients. Outpatient care requires attention as this is where NCD patients often seek treatment and optimal handover of information is essential. We investigated handover, healthcare communication and barriers to continuity of care for chronic NCD outpatients in India. We also explored potential interventions for improving storage and exchange of healthcare information. Methods A mixed-methods design was used across five healthcare facilities in Kerala and Himachal Pradesh states. Questionnaires from 513 outpatients with cardiovascular disease, chronic respiratory disease, or diabetes covered the form and comprehensiveness of information exchange between healthcare professionals (HCPs) and between HCPs and patients. Semi-structured interviews with outpatients and HCPs explored handover, healthcare communication and intervention ideas. Barriers to continuity of care were identified through triangulation of all data sources. Results Almost half (46%) of patients self-referred to hospital outpatient clinics (OPCs). Patient-held healthcare information was often poorly recorded on unstructured sheets of paper; 24% of OPC documents contained the following: diagnosis, medication, long-term care and follow-up information. Just 55% of patients recalled receiving verbal follow-up and medication instructions during OPC appointments. Qualitative themes included patient preference for hospital visits, system factors, inconsistent doctor-patient communication and attitudes towards medical documents. Barriers were hospital time constraints, inconsistent referral practices and absences of OPC medical record-keeping, structured patient-held medical documents and clinical handover training. Patients and HCPs were in favour of the introduction of patient-held booklets for storing and transporting medical documents. Conclusions Deficiencies in communicative practices are compromising the continuity of chronic NCD outpatient care.

Our findings indicate that well-designed patient-held booklets are likely to be an acceptable, affordable and effective part of the solution."
https://openalex.org/W2951450841,"With the advance of next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies, non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT) has been developed and employed in fetal aneuploidy screening on 13-/18-/21-trisomies through detecting cell-free fetal DNA (cffDNA) in maternal blood. Although Z-test is widely used in NIPT NGS data analysis, there is still necessity to improve its accuracy for reducing a) false negatives and false positives, and b) the ratio of unclassified data, so as to lower the potential harm to patients as well as the induced cost of retests. Combining the multiple Z-tests with indexes of clinical signs and quality control, features were collected from the known samples and scaled for model training using support vector machine (SVM). We trained SVM models from the qualified NIPT NGS data that Z-test can discriminate and tested the performance on the data that Z-test cannot discriminate. On screenings of 13-/18-/21-trisomies, the trained SVM models achieved 100% accuracies in both internal validations and unknown sample predictions. It is shown that other machine learning (ML) models can also achieve similar high accuracy, and SVM model is most robust in this study. Moreover, four false positives and four false negatives caused by Z-test were corrected by using the SVM models. To our knowledge, this is one of the earliest studies to employ SVM in NIPT NGS data analysis. It is expected to replace Z-test in clinical practice."
https://openalex.org/W2902495289,"Understanding diversity patterns along environmental gradients lies at the heart of community ecology and conservation. Previous studies have found variation in bird diversity and density along “natural” elevational gradients in the Tropical Andes Hotspot. However, there is still a lack of knowledge about how bird communities respond to traditional land-use patterns, in association with other multiple drivers, along elevations. In the present study, we investigated biotic, abiotic and anthropogenic sources of variation associated with bird species diversity, density and turnover along a 3000-m elevational gradient, in southern limit of the Tropical Andes Hotspot, northern Chile. Over four seasons, we conducted 472 bird point count surveys and established 118 plots distributed across the Desert, Pre-Puna, Puna and High-Andean belts, where biotic, abiotic and anthropogenic factors were measured. We used mixed-effects models to estimate alpha diversity and multinomial Poisson mixture models to estimate species density, accounting for detectability. Species diversity and density increased until 3300 masl and then declined. This type of elevational pattern is characteristic of dry-based mountains, where environmental conditions are suitable at mid-elevations. Habitats shaped by traditional Aymara indigenous agriculture, associated with relatively high vegetation heterogeneity, hosted the highest values of bird diversity and density. Species turnover was structured by habitat type, while elevational ranges of most species were restricted to three relatively discrete assemblages that replaced each other along the gradient. Our study revealed a hump-shaped relationship between elevation and bird diversity and density in the Dry Tropical Andes Biodiversity Hotspot, supporting a diversity pattern characteristic of dry-based mountains of the world. Traditional Aymara agriculture may have constructed ecological niches for biodiversity at mid-elevations, enhancing vegetation heterogeneity, thus providing resources for resident and rare species. Increasing loss of traditional land-use may present a threat to the bird community in the Tropical Andes Hotspot."
https://openalex.org/W2902756560,"Although core stability (CS) training is largely used to enhance motor performance and prevent musculoskeletal injuries, the lack of methods to quantify CS training intensity hinders the design of CS programs and the comparison and generalization of their effects. The aim of this study was to analyze the reliability of accelerometers integrated into smartphones to quantify the intensity of several CS isometric exercises. Additionally, this study analyzed to what extent the pelvic acceleration data represent the local stability of the core structures or the whole-body postural control. Twenty-three male and female physically-active individuals performed two testing-sessions spaced one week apart, each consisting of two 6-second trials of five variations of frontal bridge, back bridge, lateral bridge and bird-dog exercises. In order to assess load intensity based on the postural control challenge of CS exercises, a smartphone accelerometer and two force platforms were used to measure the mean pelvic linear acceleration and the mean velocity of the centre of pressure displacement, respectively. Reliability was assessed through the intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC3,1) and the standard error of measurement (SEM). In addition, Pearson coefficient was used to analyze the correlation between parameters. The reliability analysis showed that most CS exercise variations obtained moderate-to-high reliability scores for pelvic acceleration (0.71<ICC<0.88; 13.23%≤SEM≤22.99%) and low-to-moderate reliability scores for centre of pressure displacement (0.24<ICC<0.89; 9.88%≤SEM≤35.90%). Regarding the correlation analysis, correlations between pelvic acceleration and centre of pressure displacement were moderate-to-high (0.52≤r≤0.81). Based on these results, smartphone accelerometers seem reliable devices to quantify isometric CS exercise intensity, which is useful to identify the individuals’ CS status and to improve the dose-response characterization of CS programs."
https://openalex.org/W2902808876,"More than seven billion mobile phones are estimated to be in service globally, with more than a billion older phones likely to be retired. A major barrier to a sustainable circular economy for mobile phones is people’s hoarding of their retired phones. Old mobile phones may be refurbished for re-use or ultimately dismantled for possible extraction of elements, including ‘conflict’ metals such as coltan (containing elements tantalum and niobium), mined in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo and threatening wild populations of eastern Grauer’s gorillas (Gorilla beringei graueri). Zoos Victoria cares for western gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) who served as ambassadors for their Grauer’s gorilla counterparts in this community-based social marketing initiative. Through tracking of barcodes on satchels of recycled mobile phones, efficiency of ten different points of influence could be calculated for the ‘They’re Calling on You’ mobile phone recycling community campaign at Zoos Victoria in Australia. Over a six-year period (2009–2014), a total of 115,369 mobile phones were donated. The Courier Collect initiative resulted in 50,883 mobile phone donations (44% of total), followed by the Static Display at Melbourne Zoo, resulting in 29,778 mobile phone donations (26% of total). The number of phones collected for Keeper Talks (at Melbourne Zoo and Werribee Open Range Zoo) was 12,684 (11% of total), and in terms of fostering close connections between visitors and the conservation campaign, keeper talks were effective as one phone was donated for every four people attending a keeper talk at Werribee Open Range Zoo and one phone was donated for every 28 people who attended a keeper talk at Melbourne Zoo. We provide suggestions for future campaigns, so that accurate data capture can allow cost-benefit analyses to be conducted. Our results demonstrate that a conservation-based organisation, in partnership with corporate sponsors and community groups can effectively influenced people’s mobile phone recycling behavior, paving the way for international collaborations to maximize scale and impact."
https://openalex.org/W2903239974,"Inactivating mutations in the control of virulence two-component regulatory system (covRS) often account for the hypervirulent phenotype in severe, invasive group A streptococcal (GAS) infections. As CovR represses production of the anti-phagocytic hyaluronic acid capsule, high level capsule production is generally considered critical to the hypervirulent phenotype induced by CovRS inactivation. There have recently been large outbreaks of GAS strains lacking capsule, but there are currently no data on the virulence of covRS-mutated, acapsular strains in vivo. We investigated the impact of CovRS inactivation in acapsular serotype M4 strains using a wild-type (M4-SC-1) and a naturally-occurring CovS-inactivated strain (M4-LC-1) that contains an 11bp covS insertion. M4-LC-1 was significantly more virulent in a mouse bacteremia model but caused smaller lesions in a subcutaneous mouse model. Over 10% of the genome showed significantly different transcript levels in M4-LC-1 vs. M4-SC-1 strain. Notably, the Mga regulon and multiple cell surface protein-encoding genes were strongly upregulated–a finding not observed for CovS-inactivated, encapsulated M1 or M3 GAS strains. Consistent with the transcriptomic data, transmission electron microscopy revealed markedly altered cell surface morphology of M4-LC-1 compared to M4-SC-1. Insertional inactivation of covS in M4-SC-1 recapitulated the transcriptome and cell surface morphology. Analysis of the cell surface following CovS-inactivation revealed that the upregulated proteins were part of the Mga regulon. Inactivation of mga in M4-LC-1 reduced transcript levels of multiple cell surface proteins and reversed the cell surface alterations consistent with the effect of CovS inactivation on cell surface composition being mediated by Mga. CovRS-inactivating mutations were detected in 20% of current invasive serotype M4 strains in the United States. Thus, we discovered that hypervirulent M4 GAS strains with covRS mutations can arise in an acapsular background and that such hypervirulence is associated with profound alteration of the cell surface."

Date fruits represent a major crop in the Middle East and are key to achieving future food independence in arid countries like Qatar. We previously determined the genome of the date palm Phoenix dactylifera and showed that date palm trees world-wide divide into two distinct subpopulations of Eastern and Western origins. Here we applied a resource of SNPs from 179 commercially available date fruits to assess the genetic diversity of date palm trees grown in the State of Qatar. We found that palm trees in Qatar are mainly of Eastern origin, and that their genetic diversity doesn't associate with regions of the State. Together with targeted genetic assays, our resource can be used in the future for date palm cultivar identification, to aid selecting suitable cultivars for targeted breeding, to improve a country's date palm genetic diversity, and to certify the origin of date fruits and trees."

The primary aim was to evaluate the acceptability of repeated self-sampling at home for HPV-testing in elderly women. The prevalence of HPV and HPV related dysplasia as well as the sensitivity of cytology was evaluated.Repeated self-sampling at home for HPV testing was offered 375 women in each of the four age groups 60, 65, 70 and 75 years. Women with two consecutive positive HPV tests were examined with sampling for histology and cytology.A self-sample was provided by 59.5% (893/1500) of the invited women. The overall prevalence of HPV was 4.4% (95% CI 3.2-6.0, n = 39) in the first test, and 2.5% were persistent positive in the second test (95% C 1.6-3.8, n = 22) collected on average 5.5 months later. Dysplasia, was found in 1.8% (16/893) (95% CI 1.1-3.0) and CIN 2+ in 1.0% (9/893) (95%CI 0.5-2.0) of the women. Of the 16 women with dysplasia in histology, 13 (81.2%) had a normal cytology.Repeated self-sampling at home combined with HPV testing was well accepted among elderly women. A high prevalence of CIN was diagnosed by histology. Cytology showed extremely low sensitivity and should not be recommended for this age group."

https://openalex.org/W2902189234,"Oscillations of the brain’s local field potential (LFP) may coordinate neural ensembles and brain networks. It has been difficult to causally test this model or to translate its implications into treatments, because there are few reliable ways to alter LFP oscillations. We developed a closed-loop analog circuit to enhance brain oscillations by feeding them back into cortex through phase-locked transcranial electrical stimulation. We tested the system in a rhesus macaque with chronically implanted electrode arrays, targeting 8–15 Hz (alpha) oscillations. Ten seconds of stimulation increased alpha oscillatory power for up to 1 second after stimulation offset. In contrast, open-loop stimulation decreased alpha power. There was no effect in the neighboring 15–30 Hz (beta) LFP rhythm or on a neighboring array that did not participate in closed-loop feedback. Analog closed-loop neurostimulation might thus be a useful strategy for altering brain oscillations, both for basic research and the treatment of neuro-psychiatric disease."
https://openalex.org/W2902968314,"Puumala hantavirus (PUUV) infected patients typically suffer from acute kidney injury (AKI). Adipokines have inflammation modulating functions in acute diseases including AKI. We examined plasma levels of three adipokines (resistin, leptin, and adiponectin) in acute PUUV infection and their associations with disease severity.This study included 79 patients hospitalized due to acute PUUV infection. Plasma resistin, leptin, adiponectin, as well as IL-6 and CRP, were measured at the acute phase, recovery phase and one year after hospitalization.Plasma resistin levels were significantly higher in the acute phase compared to the recovery phase and one year after (median resistin 28 pg/mL (11-107) vs. 17 pg/mL (7-36) vs. 14 pg/mL (7-31), p<0.001). Maximum resistin concentration correlated with maximum plasma creatinine levels (r = 0.63; p<0.001). The higher the amount of albuminuria in the urine dipstick test (0-1+, 2+ or 3+) at admission, the higher the median of maximum resistin (24.7 pg/mL, 25.4 pg/mL and 39.6 pg/mL, respectively, p = 0.002). High resistin was also an independent risk factor for severe AKI (creatinine ≥353.6μmol/L) (OR 1.08, 95% CI 1.02-1.14). Neither plasma leptin nor adiponectin level had any correlation with creatinine concentration or the amount of albuminuria.Plasma resistin independently associates with the severity of AKI in acute PUUV infection. The association of resistin with the amount of albuminuria suggests that the level of plasma resistin is not only influenced by renal clearance but could have some role in the pathogenesis of AKI during PUUV infection."
https://openalex.org/W2902795216,"Background The death of a newborn baby is devastating. While clinical issues may be a primary concern, interpersonal aspects can impact significantly. Mothers in this situation are not easy to access for research and little quantitative evidence is available. In this study we aimed to describe their experience of care, emphasising associations with infant gestational age. Methods Secondary analysis of population-based survey data collected through the Office for National Statistics following neonatal death in England in 2012–13. Women were asked about clinical events and care during pregnancy, labour and birth, when the baby died, postnatally and in the neonatal unit. Results 249 mothers returned completed questionnaires (30% response rate), 50% of births were at 28 weeks’ gestation or less and 66% had babies admitted for neonatal care. 24% of women were left alone and worried during labour and 18% after birth. Only 49% felt sufficiently involved in decision-making at this time. Postnatally only 53% were cared for away from other mothers and babies, 47% could not have their partner stay with them, and 55% were not located close to their baby. Mothers of term babies were significantly less likely to report confidence in staff, feeling listened to and having concerns taken seriously during labour, and postnatally many felt insufficiently informed about their baby’s condition, and that neonatal staff were not always aware of parental needs. However, most mothers (84%) were satisfied with neonatal care. Conclusions There is room for improvement if women whose babies die in the neonatal period are to receive the care and support they need. Women who have a baby admitted to a neonatal unit should be cared for nearby, with room for their partner and with greater involvement in decision-making, particularly where withdrawal of life support is considered."
https://openalex.org/W2902917140,"Rewards constitute crucial signals that motivate approach behavior and facilitate the perceptual processing of objects associated with favorable outcomes in past encounters. Reward-related influences on perception and attention have been reliably observed in studies where a reward is paired with a unidimensional low-level visual feature, such as the color or orientation of a line in visual search tasks. However, our environment is drastically different and composed of multidimensional and changing visual features, encountered in complex and dynamic scenes. Here, we designed an immersive virtual reality (VR) experiment using a 4-frame CAVE system to investigate the impact of rewards on attentional orienting and gaze patterns in a naturalistic and ecological environment. Forty-one healthy participants explored a virtual forest and responded to targets appearing on either the left or right side of their path. To test for reward-induced biases in spatial orienting, targets on one side were associated with high reward, whereas those on the opposite side were paired with a low reward. Eye-movements recording showed that left-side high rewards led to subsequent increase of eye gaze fixations towards this side of the path, but no such asymmetry was found after exposure to right-sided high rewards. A milder spatial bias was also observed after left-side high rewards during subsequent exploration of a virtual castle yard, but not during route turn choices along the forest path. Our results indicate that reward-related influences on attention and behavior may be better learned in left than right space, in line with a right hemisphere dominance, and could generalize to another environment to some extent, but not to spatial choices in another decision task, suggesting some domain- or context-specificity. This proof-of-concept study also outlines the advantages and the possible drawbacks of the use of the 3D CAVE immersive platform for VR in neuroscience."

Methods Analyzes were performed on a population-based cohort (n = 115 196) born in 1990 in Sweden (51.3% boys, 48.7% girls) using data from several national registries. Multiple linear regression and logistic regression were used to analyze associations between study variables. Results Overall grade points and eligibility for continuation to upper secondary school were lower for individuals exposed to hospitalizations. Only the association between hospitalizations and overall grade points was moderated by gender and only for ages 13–16 years. Exposure close to actual grading had worst outcomes. Conclusions Health problems, measured through hospitalizations, was significantly associated with lower school achievements among Swedish children. Girls exposed to health problems requiring hospitalizations had relatively poorer school achievements as compared to boys. Health problems requiring hospitalization during junior high school had the greatest negative association with final achievement at compulsory school."
https://openalex.org/W2903045551,"Modern fast-growing broilers are susceptible to cardiac dysfunctions because their relatively small hearts cannot adequately meet the increased need of pumping blood through a large body mass. To improve cardiac health in broilers through breeding, we need to identify the genes and pathways that contribute to imbalanced cardiac development and occurrence of heart dysfunction. Two broiler lines-Ross 708 and Illinois-were included in this study as models of modern fast-growing and heritage slow-growing broilers, respectively. The left ventricular transcriptome were compared between the two broiler lines at day 6 and 21 post hatch through RNA-seq analysis to identify genes and pathways regulating compromised cardiac development in modern broilers. Number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs, p<0.05) between the two broiler lines increased from 321 at day 6 to 819 at day 21. As the birds grew, Ross broilers showed more DEGs (n = 1879) than Illinois broilers (n = 1117). Both broilers showed significant change of muscle related genes and immune genes, but Ross broilers showed remarkable change of expression of several lipid transporter genes including APOA4, APOB, APOH, FABP4 and RBP7. Ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA) suggested that increased cell apoptosis and inhibited cell cycle due to increased lipid accumulation, oxidative stress and endoplasmic reticulum stress may be related to the increased cardiac dysfunctions in fast-growing broilers. Cell cycle regulatory pathways like ""Mitotic Roles of Polo-like Kinases"" are ranked as the top changed pathways related to the cell apoptosis. These findings provide further insight into the cardiac dysfunction in modern broilers and also potential targets for improvement of their cardiac health through breeding."
https://openalex.org/W2903162869,"Oil spills, such as the Deepwater Horizon spill in the Gulf of Mexico, have the potential to dramatically alter coastal food webs through a variety of mechanisms. While oil can have direct impacts on primary producers through toxicity and shading, it is also possible that more subtle, indirect changes to the interactions among organisms could alter energy flow through the ecosystem. Here, we present the results of a series of manipulative experiments to determine the impacts of oil exposure on herbivory of Ruppia maritima, one of the most common species of submerged vegetation found in the region impacted by the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill. In previous experiments, R. maritima was grown in a range of manipulated sediment oil concentrations. Using plant tissue from this experiment, we analyzed the effects of oil on plant chemical composition and found that plant carbon:nitrogen ratio (C:N) was reduced by as much as 21% in plants exposed to higher concentrations of oil. Given that nitrogen plays a key role in herbivore preference patterns, we performed herbivory assays and found oil-contaminated plants were preferred by herbivores in choice trials, although subsequent no-choice experiments indicated herbivores consumed less oil-contaminated tissue. We hypothesize the reason for this is that more tissue of higher C:N content is needed to meet similar metabolic demands while avoiding the potentially negative impacts of feeding on contaminated tissues. These results indicate that substantial food web alterations may occur via enhanced consumption of oil-exposed plants and provides vital information necessary to assess the large-scale impact of oil on submerged macrophytes."

Diagnosed individuals exhibit lower systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and overall lower probability of remaining hypertensive than undiagnosed individuals. We also show the main channels through which this is achieved: taking medication, routinely monitoring one’s blood pressure, and engaging in moderate physical activities. We also point to channels through which additional benefits could be realized, but that are currently ineffective: dietary changes and maintaining a healthy body weight. Combined, these results point to the importance of directing public policy towards addressing the under-diagnosis problem and educating the public of the benefits of adopting a healthy life-style."

We projected well-known surveys measuring leadership, motivation and outcomes into large text samples from these three media domains significantly different impacts on survey responses. Business press language was best in explaining leadership-related items, PR language best at explaining organizational results and ""ordinary"" newspaper language seemed to explain the relationship among motivation items.

https://openalex.org/W2903019511,"Propagating phenomena in networks have received significant amount of attention within various domains, ranging from contagion in epidemiology, to diffusion of innovations and social influence on behavior and communication. Often these studies attempt to model propagation processes in networks to create interventions that steer propagation dynamics towards desired or away from undesired outcomes. Traditionally, studies have used relatively simple models of the propagation mechanism. In most propagation models this mechanism is described as a monolithic process and a single parameter for the infection rate. Such a description of the propagation mechanism is a severe simplification of mechanisms described in various theoretical exchange theories and phenomena found in real world settings, and largely fails to capture the nuances present in such descriptions. Recent work has suggested that such a simplification may not be sufficient to explain observed propagation dynamics, as nuances of the mechanism of propagation can have a severe impact on its dynamics. This suggests a better understanding of the role of the propagation mechanism is desired. In this paper we put forward a novel framework and model for propagation, the RTR framework. This framework, based on communication theory, decomposes the propagation mechanism into three sub-processes; Radiation, Transmission and Reception (RTR). We show that the RTR framework provides a more detailed way for specifying and conceptually thinking about the process of propagation, aligns better with existing real world interventions, and allows for gaining new insights into effective intervention strategies. By decomposing the propagation mechanism, we show that the specifications of this mechanism can have significant impact on the effectiveness of network interventions. We show that for the same composite single-parameter specification, different decompositions in Radiation, Transmission and Reception yield very different effectiveness estimates for the same network intervention, from 30% less effective to 70% more effective. We find that the appropriate choice for intervention depends strongly on the decomposition of the propagation mechanism. Our findings highlight that a correct decomposition of the mechanism is a prerequisite for developing effective network intervention strategies, and that the use of monolithic models, which oversimplify the mechanism, can be problematic of supporting decisions related to network interventions. In contrast, by allowing more detailed specification of the propagation mechanism and enabling this mechanism to be linked to existing interventions, the RTR framework provides a valuable tool for those designing interventions and implementing interventions strategies."
https://openalex.org/W2903052179,"To investigate the imaging features of cyst infection in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) patients using computed tomography (CT) and ultrasonography (US).The institutional review board approved this retrospective study. Fifty-one episodes with proven cyst infection in forty-three ADPKD patients were included. Two experienced abdominal radiologists reviewed CT and US images and evaluated the following imaging features in consensus: cyst size, location, cyst shape, intracystic attenuation, intracystic echogenicity, intracystic heterogeneity, wall thickness, the presence of fluid-fluid level, septation, intracystic gas, pericystic fat infiltration, and pericystic hyperemia. Intracystic attenuation was measured for all infected cysts and two presumed normal cysts and compared using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test.On CT scans, the median size of infected cysts was 5.5 cm (range: 2.3-18.8 cm) and 46 of 51 (90.2%) infected cysts were located in the subcapsular region. Most (48 of 51, 94.1%) infected cysts showed lobulated, focal bulging or irregular shape. Discernible wall thickening (84.1%) was the most frequently found imaging feature of infected cysts followed by relatively higher intracystic attenuation compared to normal cysts (79.1%) and pericystic fat infiltration (52.9%). Fluid/fluid level was found in 3 of 51 (5.9%) infected cysts and intracystic gas was found in 3 of 51 (5.9%) infected cysts, respectively. For hepatic cysts, 11 of 14 (78.6%) infected cysts showed pericystic hyperemia. Intracystic attenuation was significantly higher in infected cysts (median; 19.0 HU) than in presumed normal cysts (median; 8.5 HU) (P<0.001), and exceeded 25 HU in 18 (35.3%) of 51 infected cysts. Among the 41 infected cysts for which US images were available, 35 (85.1%) showed heterogeneous echogenicity.Minute imaging features such as minimal wall thickening or relatively high attenuation compared to normal cysts would be helpful to detect infected cysts in ADPKD patients."

A positive NAAT may therefore represent a false positive for infection, since diarrhea due to various aetiologies may occur in hospitalized patients. Our objective was to help answer the question: ""does this medical inpatient with diarrhea have CDI?""We conducted a retrospective cohort study (n = 248) on the Clinical Teaching Units of the Royal Victoria Hospital (Montréal, Canada). Patients were included if they had a NAAT between January 2014 and September 2015 and their admission diagnosis was not CDI. CDI cases and non-CDI cases were compared, and independent predictors of CDI were determined by logistic regression.Several factors were independently associated with CDI, including: hemodialysis (OR: 13.5, 95% CI: 2.85-63.8), atrial fibrillation (OR: 3.70, 95% CI: 1.52-9.01), whether the patient received empiric treatment (OR: 3.01, 95% CI: 1.04-8.68), systemic antibiotic therapy prior to testing (OR: 4.23, 95% CI: 1.71-10.5), previous positive NAAT (OR: 3.70, 95% CI: 1.41-9.72), and a leukocyte count of 11x109/L or higher (OR: 3.43, 95% CI: 1.42-8.26). The area under the curve was 0.80.For patients presenting with hospital-onset diarrhea, various parameters can help differentiate between CDI and other causes. A clinical prediction calculator derived from our cohort (http://individual.utoronto.ca/leet/cdiff.html) might assist clinicians in estimating the risk of CDI for inpatients; those with low pre-test probability may not require immediate testing, treatment, nor prolonged isolation."
https://openalex.org/W2902481348,"By offering high sequencing speed and ultra-high-throughput at a low price, Illumina next-generation sequencing platforms have been widely adopted in recent years. However, an experiment with multiplexed library could be at risk of molecular recombination, known as ""index switching"", which causes a proportion of the reads to be assigned to an incorrect sample. It is reported that a new advance, exclusion amplification (ExAmp) in conjunction with the patterned flow cell technology introduced on HiSeq 3000/HiSeq 4000/HiSeq X sequencing systems, potentially suffers from a higher rate of index switching than conventional bridge amplification. We took advantage of the diverse but highly cell-specific expression of antigen receptors on immune cells to quantify index switching on single cell RNA-seq data that were sequenced on HiSeq 3000 and HiSeq 4000. By utilizing the unique antigen receptor expression, we could quantify the spread-of-signal from many different wells (n = 55 from total of three batches) due to index switching. Based on full-length T cell receptor (TCR) sequences from all samples reconstructed by TraCeR and TCR gene expression quantified by Kallisto, we found index switching in all three batches of experiments investigated. The median percentage of incorrectly detected markers was estimated to be 3.9% (interquartile range (IQR): 1.7%-7.3%). We did not detect any consistent patterns of certain indices to be more prone to switching than others, suggesting that index switching is a stochastic process. Our results confirm that index switching is a problem that affects samples run in multiplexed libraries on Illumina HiSeq 3000 and HiSeq 4000 platforms."
https://openalex.org/W2902987259,"Loss of one sensory modality can cause other types to become more perceptive (cross-modal plasticity). To test the hypothesis that the loss of vision changes the perceptual threshold in the somatosensory system, we applied optogenetics to directly manipulate the afferent inputs involved in the whisker-barrel system using a transgenic rat (W-TChR2V4) that expresses channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) selectively in the large mechanoreceptive neurons in the trigeminal ganglion (TG) and their peripheral nerve terminals. The licking behavior of W-TChR2V4 rat was conditioned to a blue LED light cue on the whisker area while the magnitude and duration of light pulses were varied. The perceptual threshold was thus quantitatively determined for each rat according to the relationship between the magnitude/duration of light and the reaction time between the LED light cue and the first licking event after it. We found that the perceptual threshold was more significantly reduced than the control non-deprived rats when the rats were visually deprived at postnatal 26–30 days (P26-30, early VD group), but not at P58-66 (late VD group). However, the sensory threshold of a late VD animal was similar to that of a control. Our results suggest the presence of cross-modal plasticity by which the loss of vision at the juvenile period increased the sensitivity of the somatosensory system involved in the touch of whiskers."

Studies investigating circulating HCV genotypes and their trends have been conducted in Belgium. However they are outdated, lack nationwide representativeness or were not conducted in the general population. Methods In order to determine the distribution of different circulating HCV genotypes in Belgium, we conducted a multicentre study with all the 19 Belgian laboratories performing reimbursed HCV genotyping assays. Available genotype and subtype data were collected for the period from 2008 till 2015. Furthermore, a limited number of other variables were collected: some demographic characteristics from the patients and the laboratory technique used for the determination of the HCV genotype. Results For the study period, 11,033 unique records collected by the participating laboratories were used for further investigation. HCV genotype 1 was the most prevalent (53.6%) genotype in Belgium, with G1a and G1b representing 19.7% and 31.6%, respectively. Genotype 3 was the next most prevalent (22.0%). Further, genotype 4, 2, and 5 were responsible for respectively 16.1%, 6.2%, and 1.9% of HCV infections. Genotype 6 and 7 comprise the remaining <1%. Throughout the years, a stable distribution was observed for most genotypes. Only for genotype 5, a decrease as a function of the year of analysis was observed, with respectively 3.6% for 2008, 2.3% for 2009 and 1.6% for the remaining years. The overall M:F ratio was 1.59 and was mainly driven by the high M:F ratio of 3.03 for patients infected with genotype 3. Patients infected with genotype 3 are also younger (mean age 41.7 years) than patients infected with other genotypes (mean age above 50 years for all genotypes). The patients for whom a genotyping assay was performed in 2008 were younger than those from 2015. Geographical distribution demonstrates that an important number of genotyped HCV patients live outside the Belgian metropolitan cities. Conclusion This national monitoring study allowed a clear and objective view of the circulating HCV genotypes in Belgium and will help health authorities in the establishment of cost effectiveness determinations before implementation of new treatment strategies. This baseline characterization of the circulating genotypes is indispensable for a continuous surveillance, especially for the investigation of the possible impact of migration from endemic regions and prior to the increasing use of highly potent direct-acting antiviral (DAA) agents."
https://openalex.org/W2902832761,"Reproductive site selection is a key determinant of fitness in many taxa. However, if the site characteristics that enhance offspring survival are detrimental to the parent's survival or mating success, then complex evolutionary trade-offs occur. In the Brazilian Atlantic Forest, males of the treefrog species Aparasphenodon arapapa use the temporary water bodies in forest-floor bromeliads to court and mate. Males fit tightly into the plant with the head blocking the access and after mating, stay in the bromeliad with the offspring. Since evaporation of the temporary water body inside the bromeliad results in reproductive failure, we expected that males would simply choose the largest bromeliad tanks with the most water. We found that although this was generally true, males seemed to avoid both very large bromeliads and very high water volumes. Field observations suggested a trade-off mechanism for this pattern, whereby very large and water-filled tanks would reduce the male's ability to effectively seal the tank entrance, avoid predation, or call to mating females. Males also avoided bromeliads with leaf litter and preferred slightly inclined plants. Our results indicate that during reproductive site selection, this bromeliad-breeder needs to engage in complex trade-offs between selection pressures, balancing water requirements against the need for defense and potentially, the ability to attract a mate."
https://openalex.org/W2902998746,Despite of careful pre-operative risk evaluation some patients require an acute unplanned tracheostomy during panendoscopy.Risk factors of patients requiring an unplanned tracheostomy during panendoscopy (n = 32) were compared to a control group with panendoscopy without tracheostomy (n = 180).2131 panendoscopies for Head and Neck squamous cell carcinoma were performed at our Department between 2000 and 2014. Unplanned tracheostomies were necessary in 1.6% of all panendoscopies. Patients with laryngeal cancer (p = 0.001) or abnormal activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) (p = 0.03) had a statistically significant higher risk of unplanned tracheostomy. Regression analysis showed that patients with advanced laryngeal cancer had an almost 6 times higher risk for tracheostomy than patients with early stage oropharyngeal cancer.We identified abnormal aPTT and laryngeal carcinoma as significant predictors for unplanned tracheostomy during panendoscopy. The results of our study could improve preoperative risk evaluation in HNSCC patients.
https://openalex.org/W2903365215,"Aims Information and communications technology (ICT) could support care organisations to cope with the increasing number of patients with diabetes mellitus. We aimed to aid diabetes care providers in allocating patients to the preferred treatment setting (hospital outpatient clinic or primary care practice), by using the Electronic Medical Record (EMR). Methods A cluster randomised controlled trial. Physicians in primary and secondary care practices of the intervention group received an advisory message in the EMR during diabetes consultations if patients were treated in the ‘incorrect’ setting according to national management guidelines. Primary outcome: the proportion of patients that shifted to the correct treatment setting at one year follow-up. Results 47 (38 primary care and 9 internist) practices and 2778 patients were included. At baseline, 1197 (43.1%) patients were in the correct treatment setting (intervention 599; control 598). Advice most often (68.4%) regarded a consultation with the internist. After one year 12.4% of the patients in the intervention and 10.6% in the control group (p = 0.30) had shifted to the correct setting. Main reasons for not following advice were: 1. physician’s preference to consider other treatment options; 2. patients’ preferences. Conclusions We could not find evidence that using the EMR to send consultation-linked advice to physicians resulted in a shift in patients. Physicians will not follow the advice, at least partly due to patients’ preferences."
https://openalex.org/W2903388951,"Injection safety during anesthesia is a challenging health care issue in Iranian hospitals. Anesthesia is one of the most medication-intensive procedures in healthcare and injecting patients are an integral part of that care. The present study aimed to assess the status of medication injection safety practice in a teaching center.A prospective cross-sectional study was done in 2014-2015 at a 500-bed secondary level teaching hospital affiliated with Urmia University of Medical Sciences, Iran. The study population included providers of anesthesia in two groups of operating rooms (ORs) with different types of surgeries at the center. Data were collected using valid and reliable observation and a questionnaire instruments in two consecutive phases. Mann-Whitney U, Kruskal-Wallis, and Spearman correlation tests were used for data analyses.A total of 345 injections were observed and recorded during the study period, 53% in group A ORs, and 47% in group B ORs. Eighty-two questionnaires were completed (96.5% response rate) to determine hospital injection practices and personal knowledge of injection safety. Adherence to safety requirements was observed in 58.5% of injections. Fifty five percent of respondents knew that hepatitis B, C, and HIV are blood borne diseases. Observed compliance with injection safety requirements was determined significant by OR groups (P = 0.00). Correlation was significant between observed injection safety practices by age and work experience (P = 0.00). The Kruskal-Wallis test showed a significant difference (P = 0.000) in observed safe injection practices among four job groups but not in reported adherence. Knowledge of respondents was significant by job groups about blood borne diseases and receiving three doses of hepatitis B vaccine.The study revealed that some of safe injection procedures were well carried out in our ORs, but that others were not. The reported adherence of staff was acceptable but their actual practices were unsafe. It is suggested to implement audits, provide safer supplies, and complete Hepatitis B vaccination of injection providers."
https://openalex.org/W2902787167,"Concern is growing about the high prevalence of traditional and new forms of addictive behaviors among young people due to the health risks and a better understanding of the factors causing these behaviors is needed.To evaluate tendencies in the attitudes of Lithuanian schoolchildren toward addictive behaviors over a three year period and to ascertain the promoting and preventing factors of such behaviors.The researchers developed a survey which was conducted twice over a three year period. The sample consisted of pupils in the 5th, 9th and 12th grades (N = 1590, age range 11-19 years) from both urban and rural areas.Both the recognition of and involvement in addictive behaviors significantly increased with age. Motivation to abstain due to internal factors decreased with age and increased among pupils already involved in addictive behaviors. Time- and age-related differences were found regarding substance abuse and behavioral addictions. Whilst betting adverts were increasingly noticed over time, smoking adverts were decreasingly noticed over the three year period and it was concomitant with inconsistent changes in self-reported involvement in these behaviors.Most significant changes in the attitudes of Lithuanian pupils toward addictive behaviors occur between the ages of 11 and 15 years. However, age-related changes differ for the pupils' attitudes toward substance abuse and behavioral addictions. Increasing awareness of the potential risk of addictive behaviors does not prevent their increasing prevalence with age. Increased risk of involvement in addictive behavior correlates with decreased internal motivation to abstain from addictive behavior and decreased recognition of its potential risks. No clear correlation was found between significant changes in noticing adverts and involvement in addictive behaviors."
https://openalex.org/W2903043949,"The translation of the navicular bone is thought to be a representative surrogate measure to assess foot pronation and hence foot function; however, it is not known how it is related to multi-segment foot kinematics.Cranio-caudal (NCC) and medio-lateral (NML) navicular translation and multi-segment foot kinematics from the Oxford Foot Model (OFM) were simultaneously assessed during the stance phase of walking in 20 healthy adults. Relationships to forefoot to hindfoot (FFtoHF), hindfoot to tibia (HFtoTBA) and global hindfoot (HFL) motion were explored by cross-correlations at zero phase shift.FFtoHF sagittal, transversal and frontal plane angles showed median cross correlations of -0.95, 0.82 and 0.53 with NCC and of 0.78, -0.81 and -0.90 with NML. HFtoTBA transversal and frontal plane angles had correlations of 0.15 and 0.74 with NCC and of -0.38 and -0.83 with NML. The HFL frontal plane angle showed correlations of 0.41 and -0.44 with NCC and NML, respectively.The strongest relationships were found between FFtoHF sagittal plane angles and NCC and between FFtoHF frontal plane angles and NML. However, cranio-caudal and medio-lateral navicular translation seem to be reasonable surrogates for the triplanar motion between the fore- and hindfoot. The medial longitudinal arch dropped and bulged medially, while the forefoot dorsiflexed, abducted and everted with respect to the hindfoot and vice-versa. The lower cross-correlation coefficients between the rear foot parameters and NCC/NML indicated no distinct relationships between rearfoot frontal plane and midfoot kinematics. The validity of rearfoot parameters, like Achilles tendon or Calcaneal angle, to assess midfoot function must be therefore questioned. The study could also not confirm a systematic relationship between midfoot kinematics and the internal/external rotation between the hindfoot and the tibia. The measurement of navicular translation is suggested as an alternative to more complex multi-segment foot models to assess foot function."
