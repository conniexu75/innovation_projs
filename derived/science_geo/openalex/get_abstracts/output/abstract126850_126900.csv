https://openalex.org/W2152215024,"Angiogenesis is thought to depend on a precise balance of positive and negative regulation. Angiopoietin-1 (Ang1) is an angiogenic factor that signals through the endothelial cell–specific Tie2 receptor tyrosine kinase. Like vascular endothelial growth factor, Ang1 is essential for normal vascular development in the mouse. An Ang1 relative, termed angiopoietin-2 (Ang2), was identified by homology screening and shown to be a naturally occurring antagonist for Ang1 and Tie2. Transgenic overexpression of Ang2 disrupts blood vessel formation in the mouse embryo. In adult mice and humans, Ang2 is expressed only at sites of vascular remodeling. Natural antagonists for vertebrate receptor tyrosine kinases are atypical; thus, the discovery of a negative regulator acting on Tie2 emphasizes the need for exquisite regulation of this angiogenic receptor system."
https://openalex.org/W1668039320,"Cytokines are secreted proteins that regulate important cellular responses such as proliferation and differentiation. Key events in cytokine signal transduction are well defined: cytokines induce receptor aggregation, leading to activation of members of the JAK family of cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases. In turn, members of the STAT family of transcription factors are phosphorylated, dimerize and increase the transcription of genes with STAT recognition sites in their promoters. Less is known of how cytokine signal transduction is switched off. We have cloned a complementary DNA encoding a protein SOCS-1, containing an SH2-domain, by its ability to inhibit the macrophage differentiation of M1 cells in response to interleukin-6. Expression of SOCS-1 inhibited both interleukin-6-induced receptor phosphorylation and STAT activation. We have also cloned two relatives of SOCS-1, named SOCS-2 and SOCS-3, which together with the previously described CIS form a new family of proteins. Transcription of all four SOCS genes is increased rapidly in response to interleukin-6, in vitro and in vivo, suggesting they may act in a classic negative feedback loop to regulate cytokine signal transduction."

A three-phase T cell reconstitution was demonstrated after HAART, with: (i) an early rise of memory CD4(+) cells, (ii) a reduction in T cell activation correlated to the decreasing retroviral activity together with an improved CD4(+) T cell reactivity to recall antigens, and (iii) a late rise of ""naïve"" CD4(+) lymphocytes while CD8(+) T cells declined, however, without complete normalization of these parameters. Thus, decreasing the HIV load can reverse HIV-driven activation and CD4(+) T cell defects in advanced HIV-infected patients."

https://openalex.org/W1488478985,"The proliferation and differentiation of cells of many lineages are regulated by secreted proteins known as cytokines. Cytokines exert their biological effect through binding to cell-surface receptors that are associated with one or more members of the JAK family of cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases. Cytokine-induced receptor dimerization leads to the activation of JAKs, rapid tyrosine-phosphorylation of the cytoplasmic domains, and subsequent recruitment of various signalling proteins, including members of the STAT family of transcription factors, to the receptor complex1,2,3,4,5. Using the yeast two-hybrid system, we have now isolated a new SH2-domain-containing protein, JAB, which is a JAK-binding protein that interacts with the Jak2 tyrosine-kinase JH1 domain6. JAB is structurally related to CIS, a cytokine-inducible SH2 protein7,8. Interaction of JAB with Jak1, Jak2 or Jak3 markedly reduces their tyrosine-kinase activity and suppresses the tyrosine-phosphorylation and activation of STATs. JAB and CIS appear to function as negative regulators in the JAK signalling pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2119596771,"The signalling pathway that comprises JAK kinases and STAT proteins (for signal transducer and activator of transcription) is important for relaying signals from various cytokines outside the cell to the inside1,2,3. The feedback mechanism responsible for switching off the cytokine signal has not been elucidated. We now report the cloning and characterization of an inhibitor of STAT activation which we name SSI-1 (for STAT-induced STAT inhibitor-1). We found that SSI-1 messenger RNA was induced by the cytokines interleukins 4 and 6 (IL-4, IL-6), leukaemia-inhibitory factor (LIF), and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF). Stimulation by IL-6 or LIF of murine myeloid leukaemia cells (M1 cells) induced SSI-1 mRNA expression which was blocked by transfection of a dominant-negative mutant of Stat3, indicating that the SSI-1 gene is a target of Stat3 (refs 4, 5, 6, 7). Forced overexpression of SSI-1 complementary DNA interfered with IL-6- and LIF-mediated apoptosis and macrophage differentiation of M1 cells, as well as IL-6 induced tyrosine-phosphorylation of a receptor glycoprotein component, gp130, and of Stat3. When SSI-1 is overexpressed in COS7 cells, it can associate with the kinases Jak2 and Tyk2. These findings indicate that SSI-1 is responsible for negative-feedback regulation of the JAK–STAT pathway induced by cytokine stimulation."
https://openalex.org/W1549050411,"Pyramidal neurons receive tens of thousands of synaptic inputs on their dendrites. The dendrites dynamically alter the strengths of these synapses and coordinate them to produce an output in ways that are not well understood. Surprisingly, there turns out to be a very high density of transient A-type potassium ion channels in dendrites of hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons. These channels prevent initiation of an action potential in the dendrites, limit the back-propagation of action potentials into the dendrites, and reduce excitatory synaptic events. The channels act to prevent large, rapid dendritic depolarizations, thereby regulating orthograde and retrograde propagation of dendritic potentials."
https://openalex.org/W2039254203,"On the basis of x-ray diffraction data to a resolution of 2.9 angstroms, atomic models of most protein components of the bovine cytochrome bc 1 complex were built, including core 1, core 2, cytochrome b, subunit 6, subunit 7, a carboxyl-terminal fragment of cytochrome c 1 , and an amino-terminal fragment of the iron-sulfur protein. The positions of the four iron centers within the bc 1 complex and the binding sites of the two specific respiratory inhibitors antimycin A and myxothiazol were identified. The membrane-spanning region of each bc 1 complex monomer consists of 13 transmembrane helices, eight of which belong to cytochrome b. Closely interacting monomers are arranged as symmetric dimers and form cavities through which the inhibitor binding pockets can be accessed. The proteins core 1 and core 2 are structurally similar to each other and consist of two domains of roughly equal size and identical folding topology."
https://openalex.org/W2090407808,"The immunosuppressant rapamycin interferes with G1-phase progression in lymphoid and other cell types by inhibiting the function of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). mTOR was determined to be a terminal kinase in a signaling pathway that couples mitogenic stimulation to the phosphorylation of the eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF)-4E-binding protein, PHAS-I. The rapamycin-sensitive protein kinase activity of mTOR was required for phosphorylation of PHAS-I in insulin-stimulated human embryonic kidney cells. mTOR phosphorylated PHAS-I on serine and threonine residues in vitro, and these modifications inhibited the binding of PHAS-I to eIF-4E. These studies define a role for mTOR in translational control and offer further insights into the mechanism whereby rapamycin inhibits G1-phase progression in mammalian cells."

https://openalex.org/W2012034776,"The pathogenic yeast Candida albicans regulates its cellular morphology in response to environmental conditions. Ellipsoidal, single cells (blastospores) predominate in rich media, whereas filaments composed of elongated cells that are attached end-to-end form in response to starvation, serum, and other conditions. The TUP1 gene, which encodes a general transcriptional repressor in Saccharomyces cerevisiae , was isolated from C. albicans and disrupted. The resulting tup1 mutant strain of C. albicans grew exclusively as filaments under all conditions tested. TUP1 was epistatic to the transcriptional activator CPH1 , previously found to promote filamentous growth. The results suggest a model where TUP1 represses genes responsible for initiating filamentous growth and this repression is lifted under inducing environmental conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2038416916,"The isolated, young, sunlike star TW Hya and four other young stars in its vicinity are strong x-ray sources. Their similar x-ray and optical properties indicate that the stars make up a physical association that is on the order of 20 million years old and that lies between about 40 and 60 parsecs (between about 130 and 200 light years) from Earth. TW Hya itself displays circumstellar CO, HCN, CN, and HCO+ emission. These molecules probably orbit the star in a solar-system-sized disk viewed more or less face-on, whereas the star is likely viewed pole-on. Being at least three times closer to Earth than any well-studied region of star formation, the TW Hya Association serves as a test-bed for the study of x-ray emission from young stars and the formation of planetary systems around sunlike stars."
https://openalex.org/W1971635495,"The plant growth regulator gibberellin (GA) has a profound effect on shoot development and promotes developmental transitions such as flowering. Little is known about any analogous effect GA might have on root development. In a screen for mutants, Arabidopsis plants carrying a mutation designated pickle ( pkl ) were isolated in which the primary root meristem retained characteristics of embryonic tissue. Expression of this aberrant differentiation state was suppressed by GA. Root tissue from plants carrying the pkl mutation spontaneously regenerated new embryos and plants."
https://openalex.org/W2313449389,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common cancers in many parts of the world, however the molecular mechanisms underlying liver cell transformation remain obscure. A genome-wide scan of loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in tumors provides a powerful tool to search for genes involved in neoplastic processes. To identify recurrent genetic alterations in liver tumors, we examined DNAs isolated from 120 HCCs and their adjacent non tumorous parts for LOH using a collection of 195 microsatellite markers located roughly every 20 cM throughout 39 autosomal arms. The mean heterozygosity was 73%. Our findings provide additional support that LOH for loci on chromosomal arms 1p, 4q, 6q, 8p, 13q and 16p is significantly elevated in HCC. The highest percentage of LOH is found for a locus in 8p23 (42% of informative csaes). This corresponds to one of the most common genetic abnormalities reported to date in these tumors. In addition, high ratio of LOH (> or = 35%) is observed on chromosome arms which had not been implicated in previous studies, notably on 1q, 2q and 9q. No correlation was found between LOH of specific chromosomal regions and etiologic factors such as chronic infections with hepatitis B or C viruses. This first report of an extensive allelotypic analysis of HCC should help in identifying new genes whose loss of function contributes to the development of liver cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2022277753,"Expression of the Epstein – Barr virus (EBV) transforming LMP1 in B cells activates the transcription factor NF-κB and induces phenotypic changes through two distinct domains in the cytoplasmic C-terminus of the protein. The aa 187 – 231 domain of LMP1, which is important for growth transformation, binds tumour necrosis factor (TNF) receptor associated factor (TRAF) 1 and TRAF3 and this interaction mediates subsequent signalling events. The TRAFs also associate with CD40, a member of the TNFR family, which upon ligation activates NF-κB and induces phenotypic changes similar to those mediated by LMP1. This study demonstrates that LMP1 expression in carcinoma cell lines and SV40-transformed keratinocytes results in induction of the pleiotropic cytokine interleukin 6 (IL6), an effect which is also observed upon CD40 ligation. The mechanism by which either LMP1 expression or CD40 ligation induces IL6 production was found to be NF-κB-dependent. Mutational analysis identified domains in the C-terminus of LMP1 which are important for NF-κB activation and IL6 secretion. LMP1 and CD40 share a common PxQxT core TRAF binding motif and mutations in or adjacent to this sequence impaired the ability of LMP1 or CD40 to induce NF-κB activation and IL6 secretion. The importance of TRAF interactions in mediating these effects was confirmed using dominant negative TRAF2 and TRAF3 mutants which also identified differences in the signalling events mediated by the two NF-κB activating domains of LMP1. A20, an anti-apoptotic protein which interacts with TRAF2 and blocks CD40-mediated NF-κB activity, also blocked NF-κB and IL6 secretion in LMP1-transfected epithelial cells. These results suggest that LMP1 regulates IL6 production in epithelial cells in a manner similar to CD40 ligation and implicate TRAFs as common mediators in the transduction of signals generated via the CD40 and LMP1 pathways. As a role for IL6 in regulating epithelial cell growth has previously been suggested, the control of IL6 secretion via the CD40 and LMP1 pathways may have implications for the growth of both normal and transformed epithelial cells."
https://openalex.org/W2055375040,"Pressure overload cardiac hypertrophy in the mouse was achieved following 7 days of transverse aortic constriction. This was associated with marked β-adrenergic receptor (β-AR) desensitization in vivo, as determined by a blunted inotropic response to dobutamine. Extracts from hypertrophied hearts had ≈3-fold increase in cytosolic and membrane G protein-coupled receptor kinase (GRK) activity. Incubation with specific monoclonal antibodies to inhibit different GRK subtypes showed that the increase in activity could be attributed predominately to the β-adrenergic receptor kinase (βARK). Although overexpression of a βARK inhibitor in hearts of transgenic mice did not alter the development of cardiac hypertrophy, the β-AR desensitization associated with pressure overload hypertrophy was prevented. To determine whether the induction of βARK occurred because of a generalized response to cellular hypertrophy, βARK activity was measured in transgenic mice homozygous for oncogenic ras overexpression in the heart. Despite marked cardiac hypertrophy, no difference in βARK activity was found in these mice overexpressing oncogenic ras compared with controls. Taken together, these data suggest that βARK is a central molecule involved in alterations of β-AR signaling in pressure overload hypertrophy. The mechanism for the increase in βARK activity appears not to be related to the induction of cellular hypertrophy but to possibly be related to neurohumoral activation.

The regulation of myocardial β-adrenergic receptors (β-ARs) 1The abbreviations used are: β-AR, β-adrenergic receptor; GRK, G protein-coupled receptor kinase; βARK, β-adrenergic receptor kinase; LV, left ventricular; TAC, transverse aortic constriction; PMSF, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; ROS, rod outer segment; ANOVA, analysis of variance. involves a process characterized by a rapid loss of receptor responsiveness despite continued presence of agonist. Two classes of kinases regulate receptors through rapid receptor phosphorylation; the second messenger activated protein kinases, such as cAMP-dependent kinase A and protein kinase C (1Hausdorff W.P.

Chem. 1989; 264: 12657-12665Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the G protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRK), which phosphorylate only activated receptors leading to a process termed homologous desensitization (2Lefkowitz R.J.

Kidney Int. 1996; 49: 1047-1052Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Of the six known members of the emerging GRK family, GRK2 (commonly known as βARK1) and GRK5 appear to be dominantly expressed in the heart (4Inglese J. Freedman N.J. Koch W.J. Lefkowitz R.J. J.

Chem. 1994; 269: 6832-6841Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Desensitization of agonist-occupied receptors by the primarily cytosolic βARK1 requires a membrane-targeting event prior to receptor phosphorylation by a direct physical interaction between residues within the carboxyl terminus of βARK and the dissociated, membrane-anchored βγ subunits of G proteins (6Koch W.J.

Kwatra M.M. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Science. 1992; 257: 1264-1267Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar). Unlike βARK1, GRK5 does not undergo agonist-dependent translocation from cytosol to membrane but rather is constitutively membrane-bound (5Premont R.T. Koch W.J. Inglese J. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6832-6841Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Decreased responsiveness to β-AR agonists is a characteristic of chronic heart failure. In heart failure, β-AR desensitization is due to both diminished receptor number (receptor down-regulation) and impaired receptor function (receptor uncoupling) (8Feldman A.M. Circulation. 1993; 87: IV-27-IV-34Google Scholar), in part related to enhanced βARK activity (9Ungerer M. Parruti G. Bohm M. Puzicha M. DeBlasi A. Erdmann E. Lohse M.J. Circ. Res. 1994; 74: 206-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar, 10Ungerer M. Bohm M. Elce J.S. Erdmann E. Lohse M.J. Circulation. 1993; 87: 454-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (763) Google Scholar). Recent data suggest a step wise increase in plasma norepinephrine levels in individuals from normal cardiac function to asymptomatic left ventricular (LV) dysfunction and symptomatic heart failure (11Benedict C.R. Shelton B. Johnstone D.E. Francis G. Greenberg B. Konstam M. Probstfield J.L. Yusuf S. Circulation. 1996; 94: 690-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Thus, high levels of circulating catecholamines early in the transition from stable cardiac hypertrophy (12Anderson E.A. Sinkey C.A. Lawton W.J. Mark A.L. Hypertension. 1989; 14: 177-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar) to LV dysfunction may account for the observed β-AR desensitization in the disease process. Although cardiac hypertrophy may be regarded as an adaptive response to increased work load (13Grossman W. Jones D. McLaurin L.P. J. Clin. Invest. 1975; 56: 56-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (1888) Google Scholar), ventricular hypertrophy (especially when accompanied by prolonged periods of hypertension) is associated with an increased incidence of heart failure (14Kannel W.B. Castelli W.P. McNamara P.M. McKee P.A. Feinleib M. N. Engl. J. Med. 1972; 287: 781-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). In models of cardiac hypertrophy, heterologous desensitization of adenylyl cyclase associated with down-regulation of β1-ARs and increased Giα protein are found, which are associated with reduced positive inotropic response to isoproterenol (15Bohm M. Moll M. Schmid B. Paul M. Ganten D. Castellano M. Erdmann E. Hypertension. 1994; 24: 653-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 16Bohm M. Castellano M. Agabiti-Rosei E. Flesch M. Paul M. Erdmann E. Circulation. 1995; 92: 3006-3013Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). We have recently shown that βARK is a critical modulator of in vivo contractile function (17Koch W.J. Rockman H.A. Samama P. Hamilton R.A. Bond R.A. Milano C.A. Lefkowitz R.J. Science. 1995; 268: 1350-1353Crossref PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar). Both the β1-adrenergic and angiotensin II receptors are targets for βARK1-mediated desensitization, whereas selected desensitization of β1-ARs occurs with GRK5 (17Koch W.J. Rockman H.A. Samama P. Hamilton R.A. Bond R.A. Milano C.A. Lefkowitz R.J. Science. 1995; 268: 1350-1353Crossref PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar, 18Rockman H.A. Choi D.J. Rahman N.U. Akhter S.A. Lefkowitz R.J. Koch W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9954-9959Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Transgenic mice, which overexpress a peptide inhibitor of βARK1, show decreased desensitization of β-ARs supporting the in vivo role for βARK1 as a modulator of cardiac function (17Koch W.J.

Since abnormalities in β-adrenergic signal transduction may be one of the earliest changes in the transition from compensated hypertrophy to decompensated heart failure, we wanted to determine whether cardiac hypertrophy is associated with β-AR desensitization, and we tested the hypothesis that in LV pressure overload, hypertrophy desensitization occurs as a result of enhanced βARK1 activity. Adult wild-type (strain C57/B6) and transgenic mice of either sex and 3–6 months of age were used for this study. Two types of transgenic mice were used for this study, 1) mice with cardiac-specific overexpression of a βARK1 inhibitor (βARKct) shown previously to have diminished desensitization to β-AR stimulation (17Koch W.J. Rockman H.A. Samama P. Hamilton R.A. Bond R.A. Milano C.A. Lefkowitz R.J. Science. 1995; 268: 1350-1353Crossref PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar) and 2) transgenic mice homozygous for cardiac-targeted oncogenic ras known to develop severe cardiac hypertrophy in the absence of hemodynamic overload (19Hunter J.J. Tanaka N. Rockman H.A. Ross Jr., J. Chien K.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23173-23178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). The animals in this study were handled according to the animal welfare regulations of the University of California, San Diego, and the protocol was approved by the Animal Subjects Committee of this institution. Mice were anesthetized with a mixture of ketamine and xylazine (20Rockman H.A. Ross R.S. Harris A.N. Knowlton K.U. Steinhelper M.E. Field L.J. Ross Jr., J. Chien K.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 8277-8281Crossref PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar). After endotracheal intubation, mice were connected to a rodent ventilator. Using microsurgical procedures as described previously (21Rockman H.A. Knowlton K.U. Ross Jr., J. Chien K.R. Circulation. 1993; 87: VII-14-VII-21Google Scholar), the chest cavity was entered in the second intercostal space, and the transverse aorta between the right (proximal) and left (distal) carotid arteries was isolated. Transverse aortic constriction (TAC) was performed by tying a 7–0 nylon suture ligature against a 27-gauge needle, the latter being promptly removed to induce pressure overload cardiac hypertrophy (20Rockman H.A. Ross R.S. Harris A.N. Knowlton K.U. Steinhelper M.E. Field L.J. Ross Jr., J. Chien K.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 8277-8281Crossref PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar,22Rockman H.A. Wachhorst S.P. Mao L. Ross Jr., J. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: H2468-H2475PubMed Google Scholar). After aortic constriction, the chest was closed, the pneumothorax was evacuated, and the mice were extubated and allowed to recover from the anesthesia. Sham-operated animals underwent the same operation except for aortic constriction. After 7 days of aortic constriction, mice were anesthetized and reweighed, and the left carotid artery (distal to the stenosis) was cannulated with a flame-stretched PE-50 catheter connected to a modified P-50 Statham transducer. Either a 1.4 French (0.46 mm diameter) or 1.8 French (0.61 mm diameter) high fidelity micromanometer catheter (Millar Instruments) was inserted into the right carotid (proximal to the stenosis), and simultaneous aortic pressures were measured. Following bilateral vagotomy, the micromanometer was advanced retrograde into the LV. Hemodynamic measurements were recorded at base line and following 2-min infusions of dobutamine at 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, and 2.0 μg/kg/min. Continuous high fidelity LV and fluid-filled aortic pressure was recorded simultaneously on an 8 channel chart recorder and in digitized form at 2000 Hz for later analysis. Experiments were then terminated, hearts were rapidly excised, and individual chambers were separated, weighed, and frozen in liquid N2 for later biochemical analysis. Myocardial extracts were prepared by homogenization of excised hearts in ice-cold lysis buffer (2 ml) (25 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm EGTA, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mm PMSF) and centrifuged at 48,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatants, which contain soluble kinases (i.e. βARK1), were kept. The pelleted membranes were rehomogenized in lysis buffer containing 250 mm NaCl, put on ice for 30 min to dissociate membrane-bound kinase (i.e. GRK5), and centrifuged at 48,000 ×g for 30 min. This supernatant (membrane fraction) was kept. Both the cytosolic and membrane fractions were further purified by adding a slurry of 50% (v/v) diethylaminoethyl Sephacel (pH 7.0) in the presence of 50 mm NaCl for the cytosolic fraction (βARK1) and 250 mm NaCl for the membrane fraction (250 mm NaCl was used to dissociate membrane associated GRKs) and incubating at 4 °C for 30 min. To remove NaCl from the suspension, fractions were run over an ion exchange column (18Rockman H.A. Choi D.J. Rahman N.U. Akhter S.A. Lefkowitz R.J. Koch W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Protein concentration was determined by modified Lowry method (Bio-Rad DC Protein Assay kit). Concentrated cytosolic (300–400 μg of protein) and membrane extracts (12–15 μg of protein) from sham and TAC ventricles were incubated with rhodopsin-enriched rod outer segments (ROS) (17Koch W.J.

After incubating in white light for 15 min at room temperature, reactions were quenched with ice-cold lysis buffer (300 μl) and centrifuged for 15 min at 13,000 × g. Sedimented proteins were resuspended in 20 μl of protein-gel loading dye and electrophoresed through 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels (24Cotecchia S. Exum S. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 2896-2900Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Phosphorylated rhodopsin was visualized by autoradiography of dried polyacylamide gels and quantified using a phoshorimaging system, Molecular Imager GS-250 (Bio-Rad Laboratories). To confirm βARK-dependent phosphorylation of ROS, the protein kinase A inhibitor, PKI (1 μm, Sigma), and heparin (10 μg/ml) were incubated with purified βARK, and the capacity to phosphorylate light-activated rhodopsin was determined. Heparin inhibited phosphorylation while PKI did not (data not shown). To identify the specific GRK activities in the cytoplasm and membrane fraction, monoclonal antibodies (10 μg/ml), which specifically bind to and inhibit βARK1/2 (monoclonal C5/1) or GRK4/5/6 (monoclonal A16/17), were incubated with either cytosolic or membrane extracts for 10 min prior to a standard rhodopsin phosphorylation assay (25Oppermann M.

Total β-AR density was determined by incubating 25 μg of the above membranes with a saturating concentration of125I-cyanopindolol in 500 μl of binding buffer (17Koch W.J. Rockman H.A. Samama P. Hamilton R.A. Bond R.A. Milano C.A. Lefkowitz R.J. Science. 1995; 268: 1350-1353Crossref PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar). Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 20 μm alprenolol. Binding assays were conducted at 37 °C for 60 min and terminated by rapid vacuum filtration over glass fiber filters, which were subsequently washed and counted in a gamma counter. Specific binding was normalized to membrane protein and reported as picomoles of receptor per milligram of membrane protein. Data are expressed as mean value ± S.E. To examine the effect of the dobutamine on changes in hemodynamic parameters between the control and TAC groups, a two-way repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used. Post hoc analysis with regard to differences in mean values between the groups at a specific dose was conducted with a Newman-Keuls test. To test for statistical difference in adenylyl cyclase activity, a one-factor ANOVA was used. A Student's t test was used to test for statistical difference in the parameters of LV hypertrophy, β-AR density, and GRK activity. For all analyses, p < 0.05 was considered significant. Pressure overload cardiac hypertrophy was achieved following 7 days of TAC, which resulted in a significant increase in LV weight to body weight ratio (34%) and LV to tibia length ratio (39%) compared with sham-operated mice (Fig. 1 A). The hemodynamic response to chronic aortic constriction was followed by monitoring the pressure gradient between the two carotid arteries (proximal and distal) in anesthetized animals prior to the measurement of ventricular hemodynamics. A significant gradient across the surgically induced stenosis was present at 7 days after TAC (Fig.1 B). Systolic aortic pressure proximal to the stenosis in the TAC group was slightly higher than sham-operated animals but did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.08). This moderate degree of constriction provides an adequate mechanical stimulus for the development of cardiac hypertrophy (Fig.1 A) without the development of cardiac failure (20Rockman H.A. Ross R.S. Harris A.N. Knowlton K.U. Steinhelper M.E. Field L.J. Ross Jr., J. Chien K.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 8277-8281Crossref PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar, 26Tanaka N. Dalton N.

To determine whether the development of LV hypertrophy is associated with β-AR uncoupling in vivo, cardiac catheterization was used to measure catecholamine responsiveness in intact anesthetized mice (Fig. 2). Marked blunting of the dobutamine (a β1-agonist) induced inotropic response (Fig.2 A) as well as an attenuated fall in LV dP/dt min (an index of myocardial relaxation) (Fig. 2 B) was observed in mice with cardiac hypertrophy. The LV systolic pressure and heart rate response to dobutamine between the groups were not different (Fig. 2, Cand D). These data demonstrate that β-AR desensitization is associated with the development of cardiac hypertrophy. To determine whether alterations in GRK activity could account for the β-AR uncoupling seen in these hypertrophied hearts, extracts were prepared and assayed for phosphorylation of the G protein-coupled receptor rhodopsin. Cytosolic extracts from TAC hearts had ≈3-fold increase in GRK activity compared with extracts from hearts of sham-operated animals (Fig. 3, A andB). Protein immunoblotting was used to detect the level of βARK1 in the cytosol of hypertrophied hearts (Fig. 3 C). Consistent with the marked increase in GRK activity, a clear increase in βARK1 protein levels was observed by Western blotting in hearts following TAC (Fig. 3 C). Since GRK5 is associated with the membrane, the level of GRK activity was measured in cardiac membranes of hypertrophied and non-hypertrophied hearts by assessing their capacity to phosphorylate light-activated rhodopsin (Fig. 4). A 2.5-fold increase in membrane GRK activity was observed. These data suggest that in cardiac hypertrophy, increased GRK levels in both cytosol and membrane fractions may account for the observed desensitization of β-ARsin vivo. To identify the specific GRK that mediates β-AR desensitization in the hypertrophied heart, monoclonal antibodies that neutralize βARK1 and βARK2 (C5/1) or GRK4, GRK5, and GRK6 (A16/17) were used to inhibit endogenous GRK activity (25Oppermann M. Diverse-Pierluissi M. Drazner M.H. Dyer S.L. Freedman N.J. Peppel K.C. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7649-7654Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). In a rhodopsin phosphorylation assay using purified βARK1 as a control, pre-incubation with the monoclonal antibody C5/1, significantly inhibited phosphorylation. (Fig. 5 A). When the monoclonal antibody C5/1 was added to cytosolic extracts from hypertrophied hearts, phosphorylation of rhodopsin was significantly inhibited as shown by the negligible GRK activity (Fig. 5 A). Incubation of either purified βARK1 or cytosolic extracts with the monoclonal antibody A16/17 did not inhibit rhodopsin phosphorylation (data not shown). This indicates that βARK1 accounts for the increase in cytosolic kinase activity with cardiac hypertrophy. Membrane GRK activity was also studied with monoclonal antibodies since the increase in membrane GRK activity could be due to either enhanced expression of GRK5 or increased membrane translocation of βARK1 (a process required for activation) (7Pitcher J.A. Inglese J. Higgins J.B. Arriza J.L. Casey P.J. Kim C. Benovic J.L. Kwatra M.M. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Science. 1992; 257: 1264-1267Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar). Membrane extracts from sham-operated and TAC mice were incubated in the presence of the monoclonal C5/1 or the monoclonal antibody A16/17 (Fig. 5 B). As shown (Fig. 5 B, lanes 5–8), a 2.6-fold increase in GRK activity was present in membrane extracts of hypertrophied hearts compared with sham-operated hearts. Incubation with A16/17 (Fig. 5 B, lanes 9–12) partially reduced membrane GRK activity (1.6-fold higher than non-hypertrophied controls). In contrast, incubation with the monoclonal antibody C5/1 (Fig. 5 B, lanes 13–16) markedly inhibited membrane GRK activity to levels near that of non-hypertrophied control hearts. These data suggest that the predominant GRK responsible for the increase in membrane kinase activity in cardiac hypertrophy is βARK1. β-AR density was determined in cardiac membranes prepared from sham (n = 12) and TAC (n = 12) operated hearts. No difference was found in the number of receptors between the two groups (21.8 ± 1.3 versus 25.1 ± 2.2, fmol/mg of membrane protein, p = not significant). In contrast to the lack of change in β-AR density, hypertrophied hearts had significantly lower isoproterenol-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity (Table I). Thus, functional uncoupling of β-ARs as assessed by the physiologic response to β-agonist stimulation and adenylyl cyclase activation was hindered with the development of myocardial hypertrophy. To confirm that the observed uncoupling of β-ARs was not due to the increase in inhibitory G protein (Giα), we measured the level of Giαimmunoreactivity with antibodies directed against Giα 1–3 (Fig. 6). No difference in the level of Giα was observed by immunoblotting in sham and hypertrophied hearts. These data suggest that impaired catecholamine responsiveness with myocardial hypertrophy is not due to alterations in either β-AR density or to levels of inhibitory G protein. To determine whether the impaired catecholamine responsiveness and β-AR desensitization that accompany the development of cardiac hypertrophy could be accounted for by the induction of βARK, we used a strategy of in vivo βARK inhibition achieved with cardiac-specific overexpression of a βARK1 inhibitor in transgenic mice (17Koch W.J.

Whereas nuclear accumulation of SV40 large tumor antigen (T-ag) fusion proteins is completely dependent on the T-ag NLS (amino acids 126–132), the rate of nuclear import is increased 50-fold by amino acid residues 111–125 and in particular a site for the protein kinase CK2 (CK2) at serine 111/112. Because the first step of nuclear protein import involves the binding of the NLS by an NLS-receptor complex such as the importin 58/97 heterodimer, we established a novel enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to test whether NLS recognition is influenced by amino acids amino-terminal to the NLS and the CK2 site. We found that recognition of the T-ag NLS by importin 58/97 was enhanced 10-fold in the presence of amino acid residues 111–125 and strongly dependent on importin 97. A T-ag fusion protein in which the spacer between the CK2 site and the NLS was decreased showed 30% reduced binding by importin 58/97. Maximal nuclear accumulation of this protein was reduced by more than 50%, indicating the physiological importance of the correctly positioned CK2 site. Phosphorylation by CK2 increased the T-ag NLS binding affinity for importin 58/97 by a further 40%. We conclude that flanking sequences and in particular phosphorylation at the CK2 site are mechanistically important in NLS recognition and represent the basis of their enhancement of T-ag nuclear import.

They are typically short sequences of a single series of basic residues (resembling the NLS of the SV40 large tumor antigen (T-ag)) or of two clusters of basic residues interrupted by a 10–12-amino acid spacer (bipartite NLSs), and they appear to be functional in various protein contexts, suggesting that NLS function is largely independent of secondary/tertiary structure (see Refs. 3Roberts B.L.

J. 1995; 311: 705-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar), the precise mechanism of the action of phosphorylation in terms of regulating NLS function is largely unclear, especially with respect to prNLSs where phosphorylation enhances transport. Although nuclear import in the case of T-ag is completely dependent on the T-ag NLS (amino acids 126–132) (30Rihs H.-P. Peters R. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 1479-1484Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), measurements of nuclear import kinetics at the single cell level have shown that the sequences amino-terminal to the NLS (amino acid residues 111–125) enhance the rate of nuclear transport about 50-fold (31Rihs H.-P. Jans D.A. Fan H. Peters R. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 633-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar, 32Jans D.A. Jans P. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 2961-2968PubMed Google Scholar). The sequence primarily responsible for this effect has been demonstrated to be the protein kinase CK2 (previously casein kinase II) site at serine 112 (31Rihs H.-P. Jans D.A. Fan H. Peters R.

Oncogene. 1994; 9: 2961-2968PubMed Google Scholar), but the mechanism of action of phosphorylation at the site is unknown. The cyclin-dependent kinase site at threonine 124 flanking the NLS also regulates T-ag nuclear import through negative modulation of the maximum level of nuclear accumulation (25Jans D.A.

Oncogene. 1994; 9: 2961-2968PubMed Google Scholar). Because the CK2 phosphorylation event enhancing T-ag transport clearly occurs in the cytoplasm prior to nuclear import (32Jans D.A. Jans P. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 2961-2968PubMed Google Scholar), we hypothesized that phosphorylation may modulate the affinity of the interaction of the NLS receptor with the T-ag NLS. In the present study we address this possibility directly by using a novel ELISA-based binding assay to quantitate NLS recognition by importin subunits. We find that NLS binding by importin 58 was strongly dependent on importin 97. Significantly, sequences flanking the T-ag NLS enhance recognition by importin 58/97 by about 10-fold, whereas CK2 phosphorylation increases binding by a further 40%. This modulation of NLS recognition through CK2 phosphorylation presumably constitutes the basis of enhancement of the rate of nuclear import by the CK2 site in vivo.

Subsequent to either spotting T-ag fusion proteins onto nitrocellulose membrane (dot blot) or electrophoresis of T-ag fusion proteins on a 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transfer to a nitrocellulose membrane (ligand-Western blot), the membrane was blocked in intracellular buffer (IB; 110 mm KCl, 5 mm NaHC03, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 0.1 mm CaCl2, 20 mm Hepes, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, pH 7.4) containing 5% BSA for 4 h at 22 °C. Hybridization was performed for 16 h at 4 °C in IB/1% BSA supplemented with importin 58-GST, importin 97-GST, or precomplexed importin 58 (with or without GST)/97-GST. Precomplexation of mouse importin subunits (molar ratio of 1:1) was carried out in IB for 15 min at 22 °C. The membrane was extensively washed, and bound mouse importin subunit(s) were detected and visualized using a GST-specific antibody (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.), alkaline phosphatase-conjugated second antibody (Sigma) and nitro blue tetrazolium/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-1-phosphate (Promega). Fusion proteins (0.5 μg/well) or peptides (1 μg/well) in 50 mm NaHCO3, pH 9.8, were coated in triplicate wells of polystyrene microtiterplates (Nunc) for 16 h at 4 °C. After blocking in IB/5% BSA for 90 min at 22 °C, appropriate dilutions of precomplexed importin 58/97-GST in IB/1% BSA were then added to the microtiterplates and incubated for 16 h at 4 °C. After washing the wells with IB/1% BSA, bound mouse importin 58/97-GST complex was detected as described for the ligand-Western blot assay and visualized withp-nitrophenyl phosphate (Sigma). The change of absorbance at 405 nm was followed with time using a plate reader (Molecular Devices), with values corrected by subtracting both the absorbance at 0 min, and the absorbance in wells incubated without importin 58/97-GST complex. To correct for differences in coating, T-ag fusion proteins were subjected to a parallel β-galactosidase ELISA assay using β-galactosidase-specific antibodies. Measurements for importin binding were ultimately corrected for any differences in coating efficiencies quantified in the β-galactosidase-based ELISA assay to enable a true estimate of bound importin. Initial experiments to investigate binding of the importin 58/97 subunits to the T-ag NLS (Table I for T-ag sequences of the fusion proteins) using the dot blot technique indicated poor binding of importin 58 to the T-ag NLS in the absence of importin 97, which alone did not bind the T-ag NLS at all (Fig.1 A). This was consistent with the results of others that the importin 58/97 complex constitutes the high affinity NLS receptor (37Rexach M. Blobel G. Cell. 1995; 83: 683-692Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar, 38Görlich D. Pante N. Kutay U. Aebi U. Bischoff F.R. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5584-5594Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar). Interestingly, importin 58/97 only showed strong binding to the T-ag NLS in the presence, compared with in the absence, of T-ag amino acids 111–125 flanking the NLS (amino acids 126–132) (Fig. 1 A). To evaluate this further, the ligand-Western blot technique was used to assess binding of the importin 58/97 complex to various T-ag fusion proteins differing in the T-ag sequences amino-terminal to the NLS. As in the dot blot assay, the T-ag fusion proteins Cc-β-Gal and N-β-Gal bound importin 58/97 poorly compared with CcN-β-Gal (Fig. 1 B). The sh-cN-β-Gal protein bound importin 58/97 to intermediate levels, implying that the reduced binding relative to CcN-β-Gal may have been due to the absence of the CK2 site. The T-ag fusion protein derivative sh-CcN-β-Gal, containing a deletion of amino acids 116–121 (“short” version of CcN-β-Gal), thereby reducing the distance between the CK2 site and the NLS from 10 to 4 residues (Table I), did not bind importin 58/97 complex as well as CcN-β-Gal (see also below), implying that positioning of the CK2 site relative to the NLS was crucial to efficient binding by the importin 58/97 complex. The functional significance of the altered position of the CK2 site in sh-CcN-β-Gal was assessed in nuclear import studies in microinjected cells of the HTC rat hepatoma line using CLSM. The sh-CcN-β-Gal fusion protein exhibited maximal nuclear accumulation less than half that of CcN-β-Gal (Fig. 2) but higher than that of a protein lacking a functional CK2 site (31Rihs H.-P. Jans D.A. Fan H. Peters R. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 633-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar, 32Jans D.A. Jans P. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 2961-2968PubMed Google Scholar), indicating the functional importance of the correct position of the CK2 site relative to the NLS for nuclear import. It also exhibited a reduced initial rate of nuclear import relative to the wild type fusion protein, the reduced nuclear accumulation of sh-CcN-β-Gal relative to the wild type fusion protein thus correlating with the decreased binding by importin 58/97 (Fig. 1 B and see below). That reduced transport was not attributable to reduced efficiency of phosphorylation at the CK2 site was demonstrated by phosphorylation experiments with purified CK2, where sh-CcN-β-Gal was phosphorylated to an identical extent to CcN-β-Gal (stoichiometry of phosphorylation of 2.04 and 2.02 mol Pi/mol tetramer for sh-CcN-β-Gal and CcN-β-Gal, respectively). To define the role of the T-ag amino-terminal sequences in NLS binding by importin 58/97 in quantitative terms, a novel ELISA-based binding assay was established (see “Experimental Procedures” for details) whereby T-ag fusion proteins coated onto microtiterplates were incubated with increasing amounts of importin 58 and 97 or importin 58/97 complex. Negligible association of importin 97 with CcN-β-Gal was observed, while only low efficiency binding was evident when importin 58 alone was used compared with that when the importin 58/97 complex was used (not shown), consistent with dot blot analysis (Fig. 1 A). The apparent dissociation constant (K D ) of CcN-β-Gal for importin 58 alone was 10 times that for the importin 58/97 complex. The role of the different regions of the CcN motif in recognition of the T-ag NLS by importin 58/97 was assessed using the CN-β-Gal, sh-CcN-β-Gal, cN-β-Gal1, cN-β-Gal2, sh-cN-β-Gal, and N-β-Gal T-ag fusion protein derivatives (Fig.3 A and Table I). The amino-terminal sequences flanking the NLS enhanced binding by importin 58/97 whereby binding to wild type protein (CcN-β-Gal) was about 10-fold higher than that to the fusion protein containing the T-ag NLS alone (N-β-Gal) (Table I). Cc-β-Gal bound negligible amounts of importin 58/97, indicating the specificity of the assay (Table I). The sh-cN-Gal protein, which lacks the CK2 site, bound importin 58/97 to levels about 50% that of CcN-β-Gal, implying that the CK2 site was necessary for efficient importin binding. The cN-β-Gal1 protein, containing nonphosphorylatable residues in place of the CK2 site serines 111 and 112 (32Jans D.A. Jans P. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 2961-2968PubMed Google Scholar), and cN-β-Gal2, carrying a mutated CK2 recognition site (substitution of Asp-Asp-Glu115 by Asn-Asn-Gln) but retaining serines 111 and 112, also bound importin to a reduced level, supporting the idea of the CK2 site being directly involved in importin recognition. This was further supported by the fact that the sh-CcN-β-Gal protein, the “short” version of the CcN motif containing a functional CK2 site, bound higher levels of importin 58/97 than sh-cN-Gal (deleted for amino acids 111–119, including the CK2 site) (Fig. 3 A); binding, however, was reduced relative to wild type, implying that although the CK2 site is essential for high affinity binding by importin, its correct positioning relative to the NLS is a critical factor. The lack of a correctly positioned CK2 site in sh-CcN-β-Gal increased theK D by almost 2-fold relative to CcN-β-Gal (Fig.3 A and Table I), while the complete lack of a functional CK2 site (sh-cN-Gal, cN-β-Gal1, and cN-β-Gal2) increased the K D even further. Substitution of serines 120 and 123 together with threonine 124 (the site of phosphorylation by the cyclin-dependent kinasecdc2, which reduces the maximal level of T-ag fusion protein nuclear accumulation) (25Jans D.A. Ackermann M.J. Bischoff J.R. Beach D.H. Peters R. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 1203-1212Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar) by alanine residues (the CN-β-Gal protein) had no significant effect on importin recognition relative to CcN-β-Gal (Table I), further underlining the central importance of the CK2 phosphorylation site in importin binding. Taking the results from Table I (the rightmost data columns), the K D relative to wild type for the respective fusion proteins correlated very well (regression coefficient of 0.99) with their initial rates of nuclear import in vivo determined either previously (31Rihs H.-P. Jans D.A. Fan H. Peters R. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 633-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar, 32Jans D.A. Jans P. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 2961-2968PubMed Google Scholar) or in this study, implying that the apparent dissociation constant is critical in determining the initial rate of nuclear import. Peptides comprising T-ag amino acids 112–132 (pep101Lys), T-ag amino acids 112–132 with a nonfunctional NLS (pep101Thr), and T-ag amino acids 126–132 (pep11Lys) (Table I) were also tested. Consistent with the studies using the T-ag fusion proteins, binding of the importin 58/97 complex to pep101Lys (K D of 17 nm) was significantly higher than that to pep11Lys, underlining the importance of the flanking regions to T-ag NLS recognition by importin 58/97. Peptide pep101Thr showed negligible binding (Fig. 3 Band Table I), again confirming the specificity of the ELISA-based binding assay. Our previous work had demonstrated that nuclear accumulation of CcN-β-Gal is much more rapid than that of cN-β-Gal1, cN-β-Gal2, and sh-cN-β-Gal, all of which lack a functional CK2 site (Refs. 31Rihs H.-P. Jans D.A. Fan H. Peters R. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 633-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar and 32Jans D.A. Jans P. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 2961-2968PubMed Google Scholar and Table I). To test whether phosphorylation at the CK2 site influences binding of importin 58/97 to the T-ag NLS, CcN-β-Gal was phosphorylated with CK2 to a stoichiometry of 1.0–1.5 mol Pi/mol tetrameric T-ag fusion protein, and importin 58/97 binding was quantified using the ELISA-based binding assay. The clear result was that phosphorylation at the CK2 site increased binding of importin 58/97, with about a 40% decrease in the value of the K D compared with unphosphorylated CcN-β-Gal (Table II). Differences between non- and prephosphorylated T-ag proteins were much more marked (up to 2.5-fold differences in the amount of importin 58/97 complex bound) at lower importin 58/97 concentrations (data not shown); it should also be stressed that the quantitative differences here almost certainly underestimate the effect of CK2 phosphorylation in terms of increasing the affinity for importin 58/97 because CK2 prephosphorylated CcN-β-Gal tetramers represent a mixed population of unphosphorylated and phosphorylated CK2 sites as a result of the stoichiometry of phosphorylation (i.e. 2.5 mol of CK2 sites per tetramer are not phosphorylated). This almost certainly results in underestimation of the K D for importin association of CK2-phosphorylated protein.Table IIEffect of CK2 prephosphorylation of T-ag fusion proteins on binding to importin 58/97 as quantified using an ELISA-based binding assayFusion protein2-aThe stoichiometry of phosphorylation for CcN-β-Gal was between 1.1 and 1.5, for Cc-β-Gal it was between 1.4 and 1.5, and for N-β-Gal and cN-β-Gal1 it was 0 mol Pi/mol tetrameric fusion protein.Presence of CK2 siteB maxrelative to unphosphorylated fusion protein2-bData represent the means ± S.E., with n in parentheses.K D relative to unphosphorylated fusion protein2-bData represent the means ± S.E., with n in parentheses.%foldCcN-β-Gal+107 ± 1.9 (4)0.72 ± 0.015cN-β-Gal1− 85 (1)ND2-cND, not able to be determined.N-β-Gal−104 (1)NDCc-β-Gal+316 ± 2.1 (2)ND2-a The stoichiometry of phosphorylation for CcN-β-Gal was between 1.1 and 1.5, for Cc-β-Gal it was between 1.4 and 1.5, and for N-β-Gal and cN-β-Gal1 it was 0 mol Pi/mol tetrameric fusion protein.2-b Data represent the means ± S.E., with n in parentheses.2-c ND, not able to be determined. Open table in a new tab To confirm that the effects on importin binding did not result from trace amounts of CK2 in the protein samples in the case of prephosphorylated protein, control experiments were carried out using sh-cN-β-Gal, N-β-Gal, and Cc-β-Gal preincubated with CK2. Phosphorylation of sh-cN-β-Gal and N-β-Gal was undetectable, as expected (Table II). There was no increase in the maximal binding of the CK2-preincubated proteins sh-cN-β-Gal and N-β-Gal compared with the nonpreincubated T-ag fusion proteins (Table II). We also found no increased binding of importin 58/97 to CK2 preincubated β-Gal (not shown). Significantly, a 3-fold increase in binding of importin 58/97 to CK2 prephosphorylated Cc-β-Gal was observed relative to nonphosphorylated Cc-β-Gal (Table II). This enhancing effect of CK2 site phosphorylation on binding by importin 58/97 even in the absence of a functional NLS is a further indication that the CK2 site probably participates directly in binding to importin 58. In conclusion, this study establishes that the mechanistic basis of CK2 site-mediated enhancement of T-ag nuclear import is through the CK2 site and CK2 site phosphorylation increasing the affinity of interaction of the NLS receptor importin 58/97 with the T-ag NLS. As supported by the correlation between the K D and initial nuclear import rate in vivo (see above), the higher affinity of binding presumably results in more rapid kinetics of association of the NLS receptor with the T-ag transport substrate and faster docking at the NPC ultimately leading to an accelerated rate of transport, which has been observed both in vivo and in vitro.

https://openalex.org/W1659584746,"Auditory signals are transmitted from the inner ear through the brainstem to the higher auditory regions of the brain. Neurons throughout the auditory system are tuned to stimulus frequency, and in many auditory regions are arranged in topographical maps with respect to their preferred frequency. These properties are assumed to arise from the interactions of convergent and divergent projections ascending from lower to higher auditory areas; such a view, however, ignores the possible role of descending projections from cortical to subcortical regions. In the bat auditory system, such corticofugal connections modulate neuronal activity to improve the processing of echo-delay information, a specialized feature. Here we show that corticofugal projections are also involved in the most common type of auditory processing, frequency tuning. When cortical neurons tuned to a specific frequency are inactivated, the auditory responses of subcortical neurons tuned to the same frequency are reduced. Moreover, the responses of other subcortical neurons tuned to different frequencies are increased, and their preferred frequencies are shifted towards that of the inactivated cortical neurons. Thus the corticofugal system mediates a positive feedback which, in combination with widespread lateral inhibition, sharpens and adjusts the tuning of neurons at earlier stages in the auditory processing pathway."

https://openalex.org/W1499025558,"The 3-dimethylsulphoniopropionate (DMSP) produced by marine algae is the main biogenic precursor of atmospheric dimethylsulphide (DMS)1,2,3. This biogenic DMS, formed by bacterial and algal degradation of DMSP4,5, contributes about 1.5 × 1013 g of sulphur to the atmosphere annually3, and plays a major part in the global sulphur cycle, in cloud formation and potentially in climate regulation1,3. Although DMSP biosynthesis has been partially elucidated in a higher plant6,7, nothing is known about how algae make DMSP except that the whole molecule is derived from methionine8,9,10,11,12. Here we use in vivo isotope labelling to demonstrate that DMSP synthesis in the green macroalga Enteromorpha intestinalis proceeds by a route entirely distinct from that in higher plants. From methionine, the steps are transamination, reduction and S -methylation to give the novel sulphonium compound 4-dimethylsulphonio-2-hydroxybutyrate (DMSHB), which is oxidatively decarboxylated to DMSP. The key intermediate DMSHB was also identified in three diverse phytoplankton species, indicating that the same pathway operates in other algal classes that are important sources of DMS. The fact that a transamination initiates this pathway could help explain how algal DMSP (and thereby DMS) production is enhanced by nitrogen deficiency12."
https://openalex.org/W2025787534,"The role of cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2) in the regulation of ceramide formation was examined in a cell line (L929) responsive to the cytotoxic action of tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα). In L929 cells, the addition of TNFα resulted in the release of arachidonate, which was followed by a prolonged accumulation of ceramide occurring over 5–12 h and reaching 250% over base line. The formation of ceramide was accompanied by the hydrolysis of sphingomyelin and the activation of three distinct sphingomyelinases (neutral Mg2+-dependent, neutral Mg2+-independent, and acidic enzymes). The variant cell line C12, which lacks cPLA2, is resistant to the cytotoxic action of TNFα. TNFα was able to activate nuclear factor κB in both the wild-type L929 cells and the C12 cells. However, TNFα was unable to cause the release of arachidonate or the accumulation of ceramide in C12 cells. C6-ceramide overcame the resistance to TNFα and caused cell death in C12 cells to a level similar to that in L929 cells. The introduction of the cPLA2 gene into C12 cells resulted in partial restoration of TNFα-induced arachidonate release, ceramide accumulation, and cytotoxicity.

Activation of this cycle through the regulation of a signal-induced sphingomyelinase (SMase) results in generation of the lipid second messenger ceramide. Ceramide then modulates a number of biological fates, including growth inhibition (1Okazaki T. Bell R.M. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol.

Kronke M. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 5-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). Two classes of lipid mediators have been implicated in TNFα signaling, glycerophospholipid metabolites and sphingolipid metabolites (11Heller R.A. Kronke M. J.

Chem. 1994; 269: 5757-5763Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In HL-60 cells, a linear correlation was established among TNFα stimulation, AA generation, and SM cycle activation: TNFα-stimulated AA liberation preceded ceramide generation, and AA reproduced the effects of TNFα on the SM cycle (13Jayadev S. Linardic C.M. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5757-5763Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although these studies suggested that AA and/or its metabolites may be involved in activation of SMase, the physiologic role of the PLA2/AA pathway in regulating SMase activity has not been determined.In this study, we examined the role of PLA2 in SMase activation in the L929 murine fibroblast cell line. In L929 cells, TNFα treatment is known to produce potent cytotoxic effects (14Hayakawa M. Oku N. Takagi T. Hori T. Shibamoto S. Yamanaka Y. Takeuchi K. Tsujimoto M. Ito F. Cell Struct. Funct. 1991; 16: 333-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). TNFα-resistant L929 cells have also been generated via clonal selection from resistant populations of L929 mouse fibroblasts grown in the presence of TNFα (14Hayakawa M. Oku N. Takagi T. Hori T.

One of these cell lines, C12, differed from the original L929 cells by the absence of cPLA2 and by the lack of inducibility of AA in response to TNFα. However, in all parameters of TNFα receptor binding and internalization, this resistant cell line was found to be analogous to the parental L929 line.Using these two cell lines, L929 and C12, we investigated the necessity of cPLA2 activation and AA generation for TNFα-induced ceramide generation. In the L929 model system, we found that the kinetics of cytokine-induced lipid mobilization occurred much later than previously documented in HL-60 (13Jayadev S. Linardic C.M. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5757-5763Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Kim M.-Y. Linardic C. Obeid L. Hannun Y. J. Biol.

Science. 1993; 259: 1769-1771Crossref PubMed Scopus (1598) Google Scholar) cells. Although the kinetics of activation were protracted in the L929 system, we found that, similar to HL-60 and U937 cells, the mechanism of ceramide generation was still through the activation of SMase and the subsequent hydrolysis of SM. Furthermore, we found that the generation of ceramide in response to TNFα did not occur in the resistant line, which was incapable of liberating AA following cytokine treatment. Finally, we found that TNFα-induced AA generation, ceramide generation, and cytotoxicity could be partly re-established in a C12 variant containing a cPLA2 expression vector. This study implicates cPLA2 activation and AA generation as necessary precursors to TNFα-induced activation of the SM cycle. The implications of these findings are discussed.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterialsThe L929 cell line and its C12 variant have been previously described (14Hayakawa M. Oku N. Takagi T. Hori T.

Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and kanamycin sulfate were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. Heat-inactivated fetal calf serum was purchased from Summit Biotechnologies (Fort Collins, CO). Arachidonic acid was purchased from BIOMOL Research Laboratories Inc. (Plymouth Meeting, PA). [3H]Choline chloride and [3H]arachidonic acid were purchased from DuPont NEN. TNFα was a gift from Hoffmann-La Roche (Basel, Switzerland). All other reagents were obtained from Sigma.MethodsCell CultureAll cells were maintained for up to 20 passages at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator. For general maintenance, L929 and C12 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum and 60 mg/liter kanamycin sulfate. L929/neo and CPL4 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum and 0.8 mg/ml G418. For studies, cells were plated at 2 × 104/well in 12-well plates, at 5 × 104/well in 6-well plates, or at 1 × 105/well in 10-cm Petri plates. Cells were allowed to grow to 50–70% confluence and then washed, refed, rested for 4 h, and treated as indicated. Time-matched controls were always run concurrently.Arachidonic Acid ReleaseCells seeded in 6- or 12-well plates were grown for 2 days and then labeled with 1 μCi/ml [3H]arachidonic acid for 24 h. Post-labeling, cells were washed, refed, and rested for 4 h. Cells were then treated as indicated, and 1.0–1.2 ml of culture medium was harvested from each treatment well. Non-adherent cells were pelleted out of the harvested medium, and 400-μl aliquots were counted to determine the levels of released label. The total counts associated with cells were ∼150,000 dpm, and 7% of the total label (10,500 dpm) was released in response to TNFα. The medium was also subjected to TLC to assess whether metabolites such as phospholipids or acylglycerols accounted for the observed counts. We found that minimal counts, if any, were associated with such metabolites.Ceramide and Diacylglycerol QuantitationCells grown in 10-cm Petri plates were grown for 2–4 days, refed, rested, and treated. Following the indicated times of treatment, the media were removed from the plates, and adherent cells were washed with PBS. Cells were then scraped, and the lipids were extracted via the method of Bligh and Dyer (18Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (42153) Google Scholar). In instances where cell floaters were analyzed, the treatment media and the PBS wash were pooled and spun down. The resultant pellet was then considered the “floater” population, and lipids were harvested from these cells. Extracted lipids were dried, resuspended in chloroform, and aliquoted for phosphate (19Ames B.N. Dubin D.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1960; 235: 769-775Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and diacylglycerol kinase (13Jayadev S. Linardic C.M. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5757-5763Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) analyses as described previously. Ceramide and diacylglycerol levels were quantitated using external standards, and the resultant values were normalized against total lipid phosphate.SM QuantitationCells grown in 10-cm Petri plates for 2–4 days were treated as described for the ceramide measurements. Lipids were extracted via the method of Bligh and Dyer (18Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (42153) Google Scholar), and SM was quantitated by the bacterial SMase method described previously (13Jayadev S. Linardic C.M. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5757-5763Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).SMase Isolation and AssayCells were seeded at 3 × 105/30-cm Petri plate in 30 ml of regular growth medium. Cells were allowed to grow for 3–4 days and then washed, refed, and treated. Following the indicated treatment times, cells were scraped into a minimal volume of serum-free medium and pelleted. Retrieved cells were resuspended in cold lysis buffer (20Wiegmann K. Schutze S. Machleidt T. Witte D. Kronke M. Cell. 1994; 78: 1005-1015Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar) and lysed via three cycles of freeze-thawing (one cycle = 3 min in a methanol/dry ice bath, 3 min at room temperature, and vortexing). By this protocol, ≥95% of the cells were lysed. Cells were spun at 2100 rpm (1000 × g) for 10 min to remove nuclei and the few unlysed cells. The resulting homogenate was assayed for SMase activity as described previously (13Jayadev S. Linardic C.M. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5757-5763Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Assay conditions for the three different sphingomyelinases were as follows: 1) neutral Mg2+-dependent: 10 nmol of SM (2 × 105 cpm), 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and 5 mm MgCl2; 2) neutral Mg2+-independent: 10 nmol of SM (2 × 105cpm), 0.1% Triton X-100, and 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.4; and 3) acidic: 10 nmol of SM (2 × 105 cpm), 0.1% Triton X-100, and 0.1 m sodium acetate, pH 5.0.Thymidine IncorporationCells were grown in 6-well plates for 2 days and then washed, refed, rested, and treated. Four hours prior to harvest, 1 μCi/ml [3H]thymidine was added to each well. Following the indicated treatment times, cells were harvested via a modification of a previously described method (21Smyth M.J. Runnels B. Wharton W. J. Cell. Biochem. 1992; 50: 210-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Briefly, the medium was removed, and cells were washed twice with cold PBS. Cells remaining in wells were washed twice with 5% trichloroacetic acid and solubilized in 0.5 ml of 0.25 nNaOH, and 0.3 ml was collected and counted.Crystal Violet AssayCells were grown in 6- or 12-well plates for 2 days and then washed, refed, rested, and treated. Following treatment, the medium was removed, and cells were washed with PBS. The amount of cells remaining adhered to the plate was assessed via crystal violet staining as described previously (22Suffys P. Beyaert R. Van Roy F. Fiers W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1987; 149: 735-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar).NF-κB Gel ShiftCells were grown to 70–80% confluence and then treated in the presence of regular culture medium. Following the indicated treatment times, cells were harvested via trypsinization, and the pellets were washed one time with cold PBS. Nuclear extractions and electrophoretic mobility shift assays were run via a modification of methods previously described (23Dbaibo G.S. Obeid L.M. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17762-17766Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the cell pellets were quick-frozen using an ethanol/dry ice bath, and the pellets were then resuspended in 50–100 μl of hypotonic buffer (10 mmHEPES, pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mmMgCl2, and 1 mm dithiothreitol). This hypotonic lysis yields ∼100% lysis of cells. The lysed cells were then spun, and the nuclear pellet was recovered and resuspended in 15 μl of hypertonic buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 0.4 mNaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 25% glycerol, 0.2 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Extraction of the nuclear protein was achieved by gentle mixing of this mixture for 30 min at 4 °C. The debris was then spun down, and the resultant supernatant was diluted with 20–70 μl of dilution buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 50 mm KCl, 20% glycerol, 0.2 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Approximately 2-μl aliquots were used for the Bio-Rad protein assay, and the remaining portion was quick-frozen and stored at −80 °C until gel shift assays were run. Protein-DNA reactions were performed in a 20-μl volume and contained 8–10 μg of nuclear extract, 1 μg of poly[d(I·C)], 1 μg of poly[d(N)6], 10 μg of bovine serum albumin, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mmdithiothreitol, and 10,000–50,000 cpm radiolabeled oligonucleotide probe (see Ref. 23Dbaibo G.S. Obeid L.M. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17762-17766Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar for sequences used). Reactions were allowed to proceed for 20 min and then terminated by the addition of 6 μl of 15% Ficoll. Nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels (5%) that had been prerun for 1–1.5 h at 200 V were loaded with equal volumes of reaction mixture and run at 200 V for 1.5–2 h. Gels were then dried and exposed to film. Shown (Fig. 10) is a representation of an autoradiogram obtained in this manner.DISCUSSIONThis study demonstrates the importance of PLA2 to ceramide generation and cytotoxicity. Previous studies in the HL-60 cell system suggested a link between AA and the SM cycle in TNFα signaling (13Jayadev S. Linardic C.M. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5757-5763Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); however, the L929 system, used here, has allowed the further development of these initial studies. L929 cells vary markedly from the HL-60 model in two critical respects. First, the temporal correlation between receptor activation and lipid mobilization (both AA release and ceramide release) is greatly attenuated in L929 cells, taking hours as opposed to minutes. Second, the magnitude of change in ceramide elicited by TNFα stimulation of L929 cells (2–4-fold changes) exceeds the levels attainable upon cytokine stimulation of HL-60 cells (at best, 1.5–1.8-fold changes) (13Jayadev S. Linardic C.M. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5757-5763Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Kim M.-Y. Linardic C. Obeid L. Hannun Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 484-489Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Despite these differences, both systems show TNFα-induced PLA2activation/AA generation to occur prior to SM hydrolysis and ceramide generation. Thus, the L929 model demonstrates that AA-mediated signaling to ceramide is not restricted to one cell system, but is indeed a cascade that may have greater implications.Furthermore, the L929 model has been used here to extend our studies from the correlative level to establish the necessity of AA liberation for ceramide generation. These studies were possible because of the availability of L929 clones resistant to the cytotoxic effects of TNFα that are defective in cPLA2. We found that, whereas L929 cells responded to TNFα stimulation by elevating AA levels within 2–4 h, C12 cells showed little if any elevation of AA release. Likewise, we found that, unlike the parental L929 line, this resistant line was incapable of responding to TNFα through the production of ceramide. In contrast, TNFα-stimulated NF-κB activation appeared to be intact, suggesting that only AA-dependent cascades were affected in the resistant cells. Thus, initial observations with the resistant lines illustrated the specificity of the interplay between AA and ceramide. We further established the necessity for AA generation through utilization of a variant strain of C12, the CPL4 line, which differed from C12 only with respect to the presence of an expression plasmid containing the murine cPLA2 gene. We found that, through recapitulating PLA2 activity in the CPL4 lines, we were able to re-establish 1) cytokine-induced AA generation, 2) TNFα-induced ceramide generation, and 3) TNFα-induced growth inhibition. Although the CPL4 system did not fully restore cytokine responsiveness, it did serve to demonstrate the interconnection among AA, ceramide, and growth.A number of key points emerge from this study. First, it becomes apparent that the kinetics of ceramide generation are dependent upon the type of SMase activated. Whereas rapid ceramide mobilization has been attributed to the activation of one enzyme (depending on the system, a neutral, cytosolic, or acidic SMase), more prolonged ceramide generation appears to be the consequence of multiple activities perhaps acting together: a neutral Mg2+-dependent SMase, a neutral Mg2+-independent SMase, and an acidic SMase. Whether all three of these enzyme activities can be regulated by AA remains to be determined. Also, since the long-term accumulation of ceramide involves multiple enzymes, multiple pools of SM could be implicated. At a first level of examination, however, the ceramide generated in both the L929 and HL-60 systems appears to be similar (as determined by TLC) (data not shown). Whether all three SMase activities found to be stimulated by TNFα in L929 cells can act on the same pool of SM, however, remains unknown.Second, these results raise the question of how PLA2/AA couples to SMase. The exact links between PLA2activation/AA generation and ceramide generation remain elusive. Furthermore, other components that may be involved in regulating the signaling cascade between TNF receptor stimulation and SMase activation remain to be determined. It is important to note in this context that Fas ligand-induced death, in contrast to TNF, may not require cPLA2 (27Enari M. Hug H. Hayakawa M. Ito F. Nishimura Y. Nagata S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 236: 533-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar).Finally, the prolonged kinetics of ceramide generation raise a possibility that ceramide may function as a long-term regulator of cell growth/viability. Indeed, most studies examining the changes in ceramide associated with cell death or growth suppression disclose similar long-term changes in ceramide. These include serum withdrawal,fas stimulation, and dexamethasone-induced apoptosis (7Jayadev S. Liu B. Bielawska A.E. Lee J.Y. Nazaire F. Pushkareva M.Y. Obeid L.M. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2047-2052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar,24Tepper C.G. Jayadev S. Bielawska A. Wolff R. Yonehara S. Hannun Y.A. Seldin M.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

These studies have raised the question whether ceramide generation is a precedent to cell death and differentiation or whether ceramide elevations are a consequence of the biological fate and serve more as a marker of phenotype. The kinetics established in this study clearly show that both SMase activation and ceramide elevation precede the appearance of a dead/floater population of cells. The observed increase in ceramide in the adherent population of cells demonstrates cytokine-responsive SM hydrolysis prior to the onset of death, suggesting that ceramide precedes cell death. Ongoing studies also support a role for ceramide prior to the onset of actual cell death. In cells overexpressing the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl2, it appears that ceramide generation in response to chemotherapeutic agents is not perturbed, although cell death is greatly reduced (26Zhang J. Alter N. Reed J.C. Borner C. Obeid L.M. Hannun Y.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5325-5328Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). Such studies continue to expand our understanding of where AA and ceramide fit in the overall scheme between cell stimulation and onset of response, whether it be death, differentiation, or cell cycle arrest.

Activation of this cycle through the regulation of a signal-induced sphingomyelinase (SMase) results in generation of the lipid second messenger ceramide. Ceramide then modulates a number of biological fates, including growth inhibition (1Okazaki T. Bell R.M. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol.

Although their functions are not well understood, it has been proposed that they may play multiple roles in tumor progression. We characterized membrane vesicles from human HT1080 fibrosarcoma cell cultures for the presence of proteinases involved in tumor invasion. By gelatin zymography and Western blotting, these vesicles showed major bands corresponding to the zymogen and active forms of gelatinase B (MMP-9) and gelatinase A (MMP-2) and to the MMP-9·tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 1 complex. Both gelatinases appeared to be associated with the vesicle membrane. HT1080 cell vesicles also showed a strong, plasminogen-dependent fibrinolytic activity in 125I fibrin assays; this activity was associated with urokinase plasminogen activator, as shown by casein zymography and Western blotting. Urokinase was bound to its high affinity receptor on the vesicle membrane. Addition of plasminogen resulted in activation of the progelatinases associated with the vesicles, indicating a role of the urokinase-plasmin system in MMP-2 and MMP-9 activation. We propose that vesicles shed by tumor cells may provide a large membrane surface for the activation of membrane-associated proteinases involved in extracellular matrix degradation and tissue invasion.

We propose that vesicles shed by tumor cells may provide a large membrane surface for the activation of membrane-associated proteinases involved in extracellular matrix degradation and tissue invasion. The shedding of membrane vesicles by tumor cells in vivo and in vitro has been proposed to be an important feature of malignant transformation (1Tarin D. Int. J.

Although it derives from the plasma membrane, the membrane of shed vesicles appears to have a different lipid composition, which makes it more rigid than the rest of the cell membrane (7Van Blitterswijk W.J. De Veer G. Krol J.H. Emmelot P. Biochem. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 688: 496-504Crossref Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Differences have also been described in the protein composition: alkaline phosphatase and antibody binding activities are more elevated in vesicle membranes than in the cell membrane;d-glutamyl transpeptidase and protein kinase activities, which are high in plasma membranes, are undetectable in shed vesicle membranes (8Lerner M.P. Lucid S.W. Wen G.I. Nordquist R.E. Cancer Lett. 1983; 20: 125-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Extracellular vesicles have been proposed as playing a relevant role in the escape of tumors from the immune response (9Alexander P. Cancer Res. 1974; 34: 2077-2082PubMed Google Scholar, 10Taylor D.D. Black P.H. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1985; 74: 859-867PubMed Google Scholar) and promoting tumor cell invasion (11Poste G.

Mouse melanoma cells cultured in vitro shed a metalloproteinase activity (M r59,000) as a component of membrane vesicles (13Zucker S. Wieman J.M. Lysik R.M. Wilkie D.P. Ramamurthy N. Lane B. Biochim.

Vesicles from human 8701-BC or MCF-7 breast carcinoma cells carry gelatinolytic activities similar in electrophoretic mobility to progelatinases B (proMMP-9) and A (proMMP-2) (6Dolo V. Ginestra A. Ghersi G. Nagase H. Vittorelli M.L. J. Submicrosc. Cytol. Pathol. 1994; 26: 173-180PubMed Google Scholar). These vesicles also inhibit lymphocyte proliferation, their inhibitory effect being neutralized by antibodies to transforming growth factor β (14Dolo V. Pizzurro P. Ginestra A. Vittorelli M.L. J. Submicrosc. Cytol. Pathol. 1995; 27: 535-541PubMed Google Scholar). The membrane of vesicles from 8701-BC and MCF-7 cells derives from selected areas of the cell membrane. All antigens expressed by the two cell lines are present on the vesicle membrane (15Dolo V. Adobati E. Canevari S. Picone A.M. Vittorelli M.L. Clin. Exp. Metastasis. 1995; 13: 277-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar); however, several surface antigens appear to be unevenly distributed, and antibodies to proMMP-9 bind to the vesicles but not to the cell membrane. 1V.

Thus, shedding of extracellular vesicles may represent an important mechanism of cell-cell and cell-matrix interaction; membrane vesicles may be actively involved in extracellular matrix (ECM) 2The abbreviations used are: ECM: extracellular matrix; MMP: matrix metalloproteinase; FCS: fetal calf serum; MT-MMP: membrane-type metalloproteinase; PA: plasminogen activator; PBS: phosphate buffer saline; PI-PLC: phosphatidylinositol phospholipase C; TIMP: tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase; uPA: urokinase plasminogen activator; uPAR: urokinase receptor. degradation and tissue remodeling. Tissue remodeling requires the concerted action of a number of extracellular proteinases. Among these enzymes, urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA) and a variety of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) play important roles (16Mignatti P. Robbins E. Rifkin D.B.

Two MMPs, MMP-2 and MMP-9, degrade a variety of ECM components, including type IV collagen, elastin, and proteoglycans as well as denatured collagens (i.e.gelatins). MMP-2 also digests type I collagen, in addition to laminin and fibronectin (18Kleiner D.E. Stetler-Stevenson W.G. Curr. Opin.

Cell-bound MMP-2 and MMP-9 are activated by plasmin; in contrast, in the absence of cells, plasmin degrades both gelatinases (46Mazzieri R. Masiero L. Zanetta L. Monea S. Onisto M. Garbisa S.

Addition of plasminogen to vesicles results in gelatinase activation, indicating that plasmin may represent a mechanism for modulating gelatinase activity on the vesicle surface. Our results suggest that vesicles shed by tumor cells may provide a large membrane surface for the activation of membrane-bound proteinases involved in tissue remodeling.

One strain, which we denominated HT1080/PA, was recently obtained from Istituto Zooprofilattico (Brescia, Italy) and grown in tissue culture flasks (Falcon, Becton Dickinson) in RPMI 1640 medium (Mascia Brunelli, (Milan, Italy)) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS, Celbio Hyclone, (Milan, Italy)). The other strain, denominated HT1080/PV, was originally obtained from the American Type Culture Collection and grown in our laboratories for several years in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% FCS and 2 mml-glutamine. The cells were negative for mycoplasma contamination as routinely tested by Hoechst 33258 (Sigma) staining. Vesicles were prepared from cell-conditioned medium as described (6Dolo V. Ginestra A. Ghersi G. Nagase H. Vittorelli M.L. J. Submicrosc. Cytol. Pathol. 1994; 26: 173-180PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, after 24 h of incubation with subconfluent cells in the presence or absence of FCS, conditioned medium was centrifuged at 500 × g for 10 min and at 800 ×g for 15 min. The supernatant was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C, and the pelleted vesicles were resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Protein concentration was measured by the Bradford micro assay method (Bio-Rad) using bovine serum albumin (Sigma) as a standard. Aliquots of vesicles were applied on colloidal-coated grids, negatively stained with 1% phosphotungstic acid, pH 7.2, and observed with a Philips EM 420 electron microscope. Confluent cell cultures were washed twice with PBS to remove residual FCS and incubated for 16–24 h in serum-free medium with or without the indicated concentrations of plasminogen. The culture supernatant was harvested, and cellular debris was removed by centrifugation at 500 × g for 10 min at 22 °C. The cells were washed twice with PBS, lysed for 10 min on ice with 0.5% Triton X-100 in 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, under constant shaking, and then scraped with a rubber policeman. Following centrifugation at 800 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, protein concentration in the cell lysates was measured by the BCA protein assay reagent using BSA as a standard. Conditioned media were concentrated in Centricon C-10 (Amicon, Inc.) for 1 h at 4 °C. Conditioned media and cell extracts were immediately processed for proteinase assays. Purified vesicles (10–40 μg of protein) were resuspended in nonreducing Laëmmli buffer and loaded on SDS-3–7.5% polyacrylamide gels containing 1 mg/ml gelatin. Where indicated, vesicles (∼10–20 μg of protein in 500 μl of PBS), cell extracts (1 ml), or conditioned media (4 ml) were concentrated with gelatin-Sepharose before gelatin zymography. For this purpose, the samples were incubated at 4 °C for 1 h in an end-over-end mixer with 20–50 μl of gelatin-Sepharose equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mmCaCl2, 0.02% (v/v) Tween 20, 10 mm EDTA, pH 7.6 (52Collier I.E. Wilhelm S.M. Eisen A.Z. Marmer B.L. Grant G.A. Selzer J.L. Kronberger A. He C. Bauer E.A. Goldberg G.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6579-6587Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After four washes with 1 ml of equilibration buffer containing 200 mm NaCl, the beads were resuspended in 30 μl of 4 × nonreducing Laëmmli buffer and loaded on SDS-3–7.5% polyacrylamide gels containing 1 mg/ml gelatin. After electrophoresis, the gels were washed twice with 200 ml of 2.5% (v/v) Triton X-100 for 1 h at 22 °C to remove SDS and three times with H2O for 5 min to remove Triton X-100. The gels were incubated at 37 °C for 24–48 h in 50 mm Tris-HCl, 200 mm NaCl, 20 mm CaCl2, pH 7.4, with or without the addition of 10 mm EDTA, 1 mm1,10-phenanthroline, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, or 1 mm N-ethylmaleimide, stained overnight with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 0.5% (w/v) in 45% (v/v) methanol, 10% (v/v) acetic acid, and destained in the same solution without dye (53Heussen C. Dowdle E.B. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 102: 196-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (1848) Google Scholar). The M rs of the lysis bands were determined by reference to high molecular mass standards (29–205 kDa, Sigma). Zymography for uPA was performed as described (53Heussen C. Dowdle E.B. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 102: 196-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (1848) Google Scholar, 54Vassalli J.D. Dayer J.M. Wohlwend A. Belin D. J. Exp. Med. 1984; 159: 1653-1668Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar) using agar overlay gels containing 3% nonfat dry milk and 40 μg/ml pure bovine plasminogen with or without addition of 100 μg/ml aprotinin. Twenty μg of vesicle protein was electrophoresed in a SDS-3–7.5% polyacrylamide gel under nonreducing conditions and transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Hybond, Amersham) as described (55Towbin H. Staehlin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44924) Google Scholar). The membrane was saturated with 5% horse serum, 0.1% Tween 20 in PBS for 2 h, incubated with the indicated antibody (1:200) for 1 h, and then incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG antibody (1:7500, Sigma) for 1 h at room temperature. Immunocomplexes were visualized by the ECL Western blotting kit (Amersham) using Hyperfilms. Eight μg of vesicle protein in 1 ml of medium were added to 3H type IV collagen-coated microculture wells (2 cm2; 3,000 dpm/well) (56Garbisa S. Kniska K. Tryggvason K. Foltz C.M. Liotta L.A. Cancer Lett. 1980; 9: 359-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). After 16 h of incubation at 37 °C, 800-μl aliquots of the supernatants were collected, and radioactive degradation products were measured in a Camberra Packard liquid scintillation counter. Samples and controls were assayed in duplicate. Five μg of vesicle protein, 1–10 μg of cell extract protein, and 10–50 μl of cell-conditioned medium were tested for PA activity by the125I-fibrin assay (57Gross J.L. Moscatelli D. Jaffe E.A. Rifkin D.B. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 95: 974-981Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar) in the presence of 4 μg/ml pure plasminogen. Amiloride (1 mm) was added to control wells to specifically inhibit uPA activity. Where indicated, uPA activity was measured by reference to a standard curve obtained with pure human uPA (Ukidan; 100,000 IU/mg). To remove uPA·PAR complexes from the membrane, vesicles were incubated with 900 milliunits of PI-PLC for 1 h at 37 °C in 1 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with Hepes, pH 7.4. As a control, vesicles were incubated with medium alone. At the end of incubation, vesicles were centrifuged at 3,000 × g for 1 h in Centricon C-500 tubes (cutoff, 500 kDa), and the medium recovered in the lower chamber was concentrated to 40 μl in Centricon C-10 tubes (Amicon). The vesicles retained in the upper chamber of the Centrispeed tubes, the concentrated PI-PLC or control medium washings, were tested for PA activity as described above. Vesicles (200 μg) were resuspended in 1 ml of 1.5% Triton X-114 in 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 150 mm NaCl, 2 mmCaCl2, 2 mm MgCl2 and incubated for 20 min at 4 °C and then 5 min at 37 °C. After centrifugation at 5,000 × g for 5 min at room temperature, the detergent phase was separated from the aqueous phase. The phase separation was repeated three times. Both the detergent and the aqueous phase were immediately processed for gelatin-Sepharose chromatography as described above. Vesicles were isolated from medium conditioned by HT1080/PA or HT1080/PV cells grown in the presence or absence of 10% FCS. The morphology of the vesicles is shown in Fig. 1. As was previously observed with mammary carcinoma cell-derived vesicles (6Dolo V. Ginestra A. Ghersi G. Nagase H. Vittorelli M.L. J. Submicrosc. Cytol. Pathol. 1994; 26: 173-180PubMed Google Scholar), their shape is roughly spherical, and their dimensions are variable. Vesicles recovered from serum-free or from complete medium conditioned by the two HT1080 cell strains had comparable morphology. HT1080/PA and HT1080/PV cells also shed similar amounts of vesicles: 3 × 107 cells shed ∼150 μg of vesicle protein/24 h in the presence of 10% FCS and only 30 μg in serum-free medium. By gelatin zymography (Fig.2 A), vesicles from both HT-1080/PA and HT1080/PV cells grown in the presence of 10% FCS showed two major bands that co-migrated with purified proMMP-9 and proMMP-2 and minor bands of about 82 kDa and 62 kDa. The latter bands co-migrated with those obtained by treatment of the vesicles withp-aminophenylmercuric acetate, which activates the gelatinases in vitro (Fig. 2 B). The development of all the bands was inhibited by EDTA or 1,10-phenanthroline but not by phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride or N-ethylmaleimide (data not shown). The bands corresponding to active MMP-2 and MMP-9 associated with vesicles shed in the presence of serum were absent in vesicles from serum-free cultures. Vesicles and conditioned media from both HT1080 cell strains showed comparable bands. In contrast, cell extracts (Fig.3) showed an additional band of ∼79 kDa, which may represent nonglycosylated MMP-9 (24Wilhelm S.M. Collier I.E. Marmer B.L. Eisen A.Z. Grant G.A. Goldberg G.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 17213-17221Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This observation is in agreement with previous findings that this form of MMP-9 is exclusively intracellular (46Mazzieri R. Masiero L. Zanetta L. Monea S. Onisto M. Garbisa S. Mignatti P. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2319-2332Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). High levels of MMP-2 and very low levels of MMP-9 were associated with cell extract, conditioned medium, or vesicles from HT1080/PA cells; in contrast, HT1080/PV cell extracts, conditioned medium, and vesicles showed levels of MMP-9 considerably higher than those of MMP-2. Fig. 4 A shows Western blotting analysis of vesicles with anti-MMP-9 and anti-TIMP-1 antibodies. In addition to recognizing the 92-kDa proenzyme, anti-MMP-9 antibody reacted strongly with a large band of ∼140 kDa. This band was also stained by anti-TIMP-1 antibody, indicating that it represents proMMP-9·TIMP-1 complex. Anti-TIMP-2 antibody did not recognize any vesicle protein (data not shown). To confirm the presence of the proMMP-9·TIMP-1 complex, vesicles were treated with recombinant MMP-3, which activates proMMP-9 (25Okada Y. Gonoji Y. Naka K. Tomita K. Nakanishi I. Iwata K. Yamashita K. Hayakawa T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21712-21719Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 58Ogata Y. Enghild J.J. Nagase H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3581-3584Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4 A, treatment with MMP-3 resulted in decreased size and intensity of the 140-kDa band and in the generation of a band that co-migrated with purified TIMP-1 and was recognized by anti-TIMP-1 antibody. By zymography, vesicles incubated with MMP-3 had more intense 82-kDa and 62-kDa bands (data not shown). A 140-kDa band could also be detected by zymography of vesicles after repeated freezing and thawing (Fig. 4 B). Vesicle-associated gelatinases could be inside the vesicles or represent integral membrane proteins or surface-bound enzymes. To discriminate between these hypotheses, we used two different approaches. In one set of experiments, we attempted to purify the gelatinases by gelatin-Sepharose chromatography of intact vesicles as described under “Experimental Procedures.” As shown in Fig.5 A, MMP-9 and MMP-2 were entirely recovered in the gelatin-Sepharose-bound fraction. By silver nitrate staining, this fraction contained no detectable protein; all vesicle protein being associated with the unbound fraction (Fig. 5 B). Incubation of vesicles with gelatin-Sepharose under these conditions did not result in significant lysis, as assessed by electron microscopy. In addition, the presence of 10 mm EDTA in the gelatin-Sepharose buffer prevented vesicle binding to gelatin through integrins or other adhesion molecules possibly associated with the vesicle membrane. Therefore, this result indicated that gelatinases are bound to the vesicle surface and accessible to the substrate. In a second set of experiments, we extracted vesicles with Triton X-114, which affords separation of detergent-soluble, integral membrane proteins (59Bordie C. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 1604-1607Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 6, most of the gelatinases were recovered in the aqueous phase; however, significant amounts of proMMP-9 and proMMP-2 were also recovered in the detergent phase. This result indicated that the gelatinases are associated with the vesicle membrane, possibly through relativ"

This multicomponent enzyme is dormant in resting cells but is activated on exposure to an appropriate stimulus. The phosphorylation-dependent mechanisms regulating the activation of the respiratory burst oxidase are unclear, particularly the phosphorylation status of the cytosolic component p67 <sup>phox</sup> . In this study, we found that activation of human neutrophils with formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (fMLP), a chemotactic peptide, or phorbol myristate acetate (PMA), a stimulator of protein kinase C (PKC), resulted in the phosphorylation of p67 <sup>phox</sup> . Using an anti-p67 <sup>phox</sup> antibody or an anti-p47 <sup>phox</sup> antibody, we showed that phosphorylated p67 <sup>phox</sup> and p47 <sup>phox</sup> form a complex. Phosphoamino acid analysis of the phosphorylated p67 <sup>phox</sup> revealed only<sup>32</sup>P-labeled serine residues. Two-dimensional tryptic peptide mapping analysis showed that p67 <sup>phox</sup> is phosphorylated at the same peptide whether fMLP or PMA is used as a stimulus. In addition, PKC induced the phosphorylation of recombinant GST-p67 <sup>phox</sup> <i>in vitro</i>, at the same peptide as that phosphorylated in intact cells. PMA-induced phosphorylation of p67 <sup>phox</sup> was strongly inhibited by the PKC inhibitor GF109203X. In contrast, fMLP-induced phosphorylation was minimally affected by this PKC inhibitor. Taken together, these results show that p67 <sup>phox</sup> is phosphorylated in human neutrophils by different pathways, one of which involves protein kinase C."
https://openalex.org/W2132474153,"A number of enzymes recognize and repair DNA lesions. The DNA-mismatch repair system corrects base-base mismatches and small loops, whereas the nucleotide-excision repair system removes pyrimidine dimers and other helix-distorting lesions. DNA molecules with mismatches or loops can arise as a consequence of heteroduplex formation during meiotic recombination. In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, repair of mismatches results in gene conversion or restoration, and failure to repair the mismatch results in post-meiotic segregation (PMS). The ratio of gene-conversion to PMS events reflects the efficiency of DNA repair. By examining the PMS patterns in yeast strains heterozygous for a mutant allele with a 26-base-pair insertion, we find that the repair of 26-base loops involves Msh2 (a DNA-mismatch repair protein) and Rad1 (a protein required for nucleotide-excision repair)."

First-passage rats showed obvious clinical signs and activated microglia but had negligible PrP-res (the more protease-resistant form of host PrP) or cerebellar lesions. Microglia and astrocytes may participate in strain selection because the agent evolved, stabilized, and reproducibly provoked BSE-like disease in subsequent passages.

https://openalex.org/W1988538980,"Hepatocyte nuclear factors 1 and 4 (HNF-1 and HNF-4) are liver-enriched transcription factors that function in the regulation of several liver-specific genes. HNF-1 activates genes containing promoters with HNF-1 binding sites. However, this factor negatively regulates its own expression and that of other HNF-4–dependent genes that lack HNF-1 binding sites in their promoter region. This repression is exerted by a direct interaction of HNF-1 with AF2, the main activation domain of HNF-4. The dual functions of gene activation and repression suggest that HNF-1 is a global regulator of the transcriptional network involved in the maintenance of hepatocyte-specific phenotype."
https://openalex.org/W2043174278,"We produced and affinity-purified polyclonal antibodies to adrenal myosin I. These antibodies recognize adrenal myosin I by Western blot analysis (116 kDa) and inhibit the actin-activated ATPase activity of purified adrenal myosin I. They also recognize a 120-kDa protein in extracts prepared from many different cell lines. Fluorescence microscopy demonstrated the presence of immunoreactive material in the perinuclear region, the leading edges, and the nuclei of 3T3 cells. Fluorescence microscopy also demonstrated nuclear staining in mouse oocytes at the germinal vesicle stage and in the pronuclei during fertilization. Confocal and immunoelectron microscopy confirmed the intranuclear localization. Electron microscopy also demonstrated staining of structures in nucleoli that are thought to be associated with rDNA transcription. Western blot analyses revealed the presence of the 120-kDa protein in extracts prepared from nuclei that are apparently free of cytosolic contamination. The same nuclear protein binds 125I-calmodulin and is photoaffinity labeled with [α-32P]ATP. The 120-kDa protein was partially purified from twice washed nuclei using ammonium sulfate fractionation and gel filtration chromatography. Column fractions containing 120-kDa protein as revealed by Western blot analysis also contain K+-EDTA ATPase activity. The 120-kDa protein was also shown to bind actin in the absence, but not the presence, of ATP. Since K+-EDTA ATPase activity, actin, and ATP binding are defining features of the members of the myosin superfamily of proteins, we propose that the 120-kDa protein is a previously undescribed myosin I isoform that is an intranuclear actin-based molecular motor.

As additional myosin I proteins have been identified, it has become clear that there are at least four different subclasses of myosin I (1Hasson T. Mooseker M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16431-16434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). All myosin I proteins consist of a 110–150-kDa heavy chain and 1–6 light chains located in the neck region between the head and tail (1Hasson T. Mooseker M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16431-16434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). This light chain has been shown to be calmodulin in vertebrate myosin I proteins (1Hasson T. Mooseker M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16431-16434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Immunofluorescence studies of mammalian cells have shown that myosin I is diffusely distributed throughout the entire cytoplasm and that it concentrates near cortical surfaces and in the perinuclear region (12Wagner M.C.

Although evidence for specific roles of myosin I proteins in metazoan cells is lacking, there is speculation, based on localization studies, that myosin I proteins are molecular motors involved in plasma membrane extension (12Wagner M.C.

Neuron. 1993; 11: 581-594Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). To investigate the role of myosin I in mammalian cells, we produced and affinity-purified polyclonal antibodies to adrenal myosin I. These antibodies recognize a 120-kDa protein that is found in the cytoplasm and the nucleus. Moreover, we present immunological and biochemical data that support the notion that this 120-kDa protein is an intranuclear, actin-based ATPase of the myosin I subfamily of molecular motors. Adrenal myosin I was purified as described previously (3Barylko B. Wagner M.C. Reizes O. Albanesi J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 490-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) except that we used the entire bovine adrenal gland. Polyclonal antibodies to bovine adrenal myosin I were raised in rabbits as described previously (16de Lanerolle P. Adelstein R.S. Feramisco J.R. Burridge K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 4738-4742Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Specific antibodies were purified from the immune serum on an adrenal myosin I-Sepharose 4B column and all the data reported used these purified antibodies. Control antibodies were purified from normal rabbit serum by affinity chromatography on a protein A-Sepharose column. Antibodies to nonmuscle myosin II were produced, affinity-purified, and characterized as described previously (17de Lanerolle P. Gorgas G. Li X. Schluns K. J. Biol.

Albanesi (University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, Texas). Polyclonal (rabbit) anti-78-kDa glucose-regulated protein/BiP (anti-GRP78) antibodies were purchased from Affinity Bio-Reagents Inc. (Neshanic Station, NJ). NIH 3T3 fibroblasts and J774 and MDCK cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 10% calf serum and antibiotics at 37 °C in an atmosphere containing 5% CO2. Cells grown on coverslips were fixed by incubating in freshly made 3% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 7 min at room temperature. Cells were then washed in phosphate-buffered saline, permeabilized by incubating in 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.1% deoxycholate in phosphate-buffered saline for 7 min at room temperature and preblocked in 5% normal goat serum, 5% normal rabbit serum. Cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline and stained with 2 μg/ml affinity-purified myosin I or myosin II antibodies followed by Texas red-conjugated anti-bodies to rabbit IgG (Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories, Inc., West Grove, PA). The coverslips were mounted in Vectorstain and photographed using a Zeiss IM 35 inverted photomicroscope using a Planapo × 63, 1.4 numerical aperture objective. Confocal images were obtained using a Bio-Rad MRC 600 laser-scanning confocal microscope equipped with a krypton-argon mixed gas laser. The scanhead was mounted on a Nikon Optiphot, and the COSMOS operating software was installed on a Dell 486 computer. A × 60, 1.4 numerical aperture objective was used with the spatial filter set at 0 to obtain approximately 0.5-μm sections. Oocytes were collected and processed as described previously (18Simerly C. Schatten G. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 225: 516-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Some oocytes were microinjected with 2 mg/ml wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) 1The abbreviations used are: WGA, wheat germ agglutinin; ConA, concanavalin A; DTT, dithiothreitol; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; GRP78, 78-kDa glucose-regulated protein/BiP. or concanavalin A (ConA) as described (18Simerly C. Schatten G. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 225: 516-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). These cells were allowed to recover for 30 min and then parthenogenetically activated in 7% ethanol for 7 min, rinsed, and maintained in culture, in vitro, for 8 h before immunostaining. All oocytes were permeabilized in 1% Triton X-100 for 10 min before fixation in absolute methanol at −10 °C. Myosin I was visualized by incubating the oocytes with 6 μg/ml myosin I antibody for 40 min at 37 °C followed by fluorescein-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG. DNA was visualized in oocytes with 10 μg/ml Hoechst 33342 dye. 3T3 cells grown as monolayers on coverslips were fixed for 40 min at 0 °C in 3% paraformaldehyde plus 0.1% glutaraldehyde in Sörensen buffer (SB; 0.1m sodium/potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.3), washed twice in SB (10 min), incubated in 0.02 m glycine in SB (20 min), washed in SB, and dehydrated in ethanol. The ethanol was then replaced in two steps by LR White resin, and the resin was polymerized for 20 h at 4 °C under UV light. After cutting 80-nm sections, nonspecific labeling was blocked by preincubation with 10% normal goat serum, 0.1% Tween 20 in phosphate-buffered saline (PBT) for 30 min at room temperature. The sections were incubated with the rabbit antibody to myosin I (3 μg/ml), washed three times in PBT, incubated with 10-nm gold-conjugated goat antibodies to rabbit IgG (British BioCell), washed in PBT, incubated with protein A conjugated to 10-nm gold particles, and washed again in PBT and then water. The gold particles were silver-intensified (British BioCell) for 3 min at room temperature and washed in water. Finally, sections were contrasted (5 min) with a saturated solution of uranyl acetate in water and observed in a Philips CM 100 electron microscope. Control incubations without primary antibody proved that the signal was highly specific. For double labeling experiments, sections were incubated, after blocking, simultaneously with the rabbit anti-myosin I antibodies and with mouse monoclonal anti-actin antibodies (5 μg/ml; Amersham Corp.). The two antibodies were then detected with goat antibodies to rabbit IgG conjugated to 10-nm gold particles and with goat antibodies to mouse IgM conjugated to 5-nm gold particles (British BioCell), respectively. Nuclei were prepared from 3T3 cells according to a published protocol (19Marzluff W.F. Huang C.C. Hames B.D. Higgins S.J. Transcription and Translation: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford1984: 89-129Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Cells were lysed in an isosmotic 0.32 m sucrose solution by homogenizing in a Dounce homogenizer. The nuclei were isolated by sedimentation through a 1.9 m sucrose cushion and subjected to another cycle of resuspension/sucrose cushion centrifugation. The twice washed nuclei were lysed in a buffer containing 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 m NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 100 μg/ml DNase I, 0.2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin and pepstatin, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. High molecular weight DNA was disrupted by passing the extract through a 30-gauge needle. The cytoplasmic fraction obtained in the first sucrose sedimentation step and the nuclear extract were spun at 45,000 × g for 20 min, and these supernatants are referred to as cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions, respectively. Whole cell extracts and cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions (100 μg each) were separated by SDS-PAGE on 5–20% gradient slab gels and transferred to 0.2-μm nitrocellulose paper (17de Lanerolle P. Gorgas G. Li X. Schluns K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16883-16886Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The nitrocellulose sheets were incubated with affinity-purified antibodies to myosin I (0.4 μg/ml), anti-myosin II antibodies (0.4 μg/ml), anti-GRP78 antibodies (0.5 μg/ml), or mouse monoclonal anti-myosin I antibodies (10 μg/ml) followed by peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies. Cells grown to confluence in 150 15-cm dishes were harvested and fractionated, and the nuclei were isolated using two resuspension/centrifugation washes through a sucrose cushion as described above. They were suspended in 1m NaCl, 1 mm DTT, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.4 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin, 10 mm MgCl2, 40 μg/ml DNase, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, at 4 °C and extracted by passing them through hyperdermic needles of decreasing gauge down to a 27-gauge needle. The supernatant was collected by centrifugation, ATP added to a final concentration of 10 mm, and subjected to ammonium sulfate fractionation. The protein precipitating between 20 and 65% ammonium sulfate was dissolved in 0.5 m NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm DTT, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, and MgCl2 and ATP were added to final concentrations of 12 mm and 10 mm, respectively. This solution was clarified by centrifugation (50,000 × g, 10 min) and applied to a 1.25 × 70-cm Sepharose 4B column (85 ml). Fractions from the gel filtration column that contained the 120-kDa protein were pooled, dialyzed in 50 mm KCl, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, concentrated, spun at 100,000 ×g for 20 min, and incubated with 0.2 mg/ml F-actin, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5 (100 μl total volume) for 60 min at 4 °C. ATP (10 mm, final concentration) was added to some samples and incubated for another 10 min. All samples were then spun at 100,000 × g for 20 min. The entire pellet and supernatant fractions were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and probed with the polyclonal antibody to myosin I. Myosin II was purified from adrenal glands.

Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar) assays were performed as described. We produced and affinity-purified polyclonal antibodies to bovine adrenal myosin I. Western blot analyses demonstrated that the purified antibodies recognized purified adrenal myosin heavy chain (Fig. 1). The antibodies predominantly recognized a slightly larger, 120-kDa protein in extracts prepared from a number of mammalian cells (Fig. 1). In some cells (e.g. Madin-Darby canine kidney cells (MDCK) in Fig. 1), the antibodies reacted with a 116-kDa protein that co-migrated with adrenal myosin I. It was also possible to visualize this 116-kDa protein upon longer development of the color reaction in all cell types. Antibodies to myosin I also inhibited the actin-activated ATPase activity of purified adrenal myosin I (TableI). Antibodies to myosin II, which were used as a control antibody, only recognized myosin II by Western blot analysis (Fig. 1).Figure 1Western blot analysis of myosin I distribution. Purified adrenal myosin I (M-I) and total cell extracts prepared from NIH 3T3, J774, and Madin-Darby canine kidney cells (MDCK, left panel) and cytoplasmic (Cyto) and twice washed nuclear (Nuc) fractions prepared from NIH 3T3 cells (right panel) were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose. The left panelwas probed with affinity-purified polyclonal antibodies to adrenal myosin I (M-IpAb). The right panel was probed (top to bottom) with polyclonal antibodies to nonmuscle myosin II (M-IIAb), polyclonal antibodies to myosin I (M-IpAb), monoclonal antibodies to tail domain of adrenal myosin I (M-ImAb), and polyclonal antibodies to GRP78 (GRP78Ab). Note that the polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies to adrenal myosin I react with different proteins. Moreover, the antibody to myosin II, the monoclonal antibody to myosin I, and the GRP78 antibody identify only cytoplasmic proteins. In contrast, the polyclonal antibody to adrenal myosin I recognizes protein bands in both the cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Table IAntibody inhibition of actin-activated ATPase activity of myosin ISpecific activitynmol/min/mg myosinMyosin I + actin + control antibody50.7Myosin I + actin + myosin I antibody0.0Adrenal myosin I (0.12 μm) was assayed at 25 °C in the presence or absence of 10 μm F-actin. The myosin I was preincubated with control antibody (5 μm, final concentration) or with affinity-purified antibodies to myosin I (3.4 μm, final concentration) for 15 min on ice. ATPase assays performed as previously described (2Pollard T.D. Korn E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 4682-4690Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were linear with respect to time. Open table in a new tab Adrenal myosin I (0.12 μm) was assayed at 25 °C in the presence or absence of 10 μm F-actin. The myosin I was preincubated with control antibody (5 μm, final concentration) or with affinity-purified antibodies to myosin I (3.4 μm, final concentration) for 15 min on ice. ATPase assays performed as previously described (2Pollard T.D. Korn E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 4682-4690Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were linear with respect to time. Nuclei isolated from interphase cells were used to investigate the presence of the 120-kDa protein. These nuclei and all those used in subsequent experiments were washed twice by resuspension/centrifugation through a sucrose cushion to eliminate cytoplasmic contamination. The purified nuclei, when fixed, permeabilized, and immunostained, showed myosin I staining but no myosin II staining (data not shown). Western blot analysis of nuclei and cytoplasmic fractions (Fig. 1) showed that myosin II and GRP78, a marker for the endoplasmic reticulum (48Gething M.J. Sambrook J. Nature. 1992; 355: 33-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (3607) Google Scholar), are present only in the cytoplasmic fraction. The same is true for the 116-kDa myosin I isoform recognized by the well characterized M2 monoclonal antibody to adrenal myosin I (12Wagner M.C. Barylko B. Albanesi J.P. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 163-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). In contrast, the polyclonal antibodies to adrenal myosin I described here recognize proteins with a slightly higher molecular weight (M r 120,000) in both the cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions (Fig. 1). The difference in the molecular weights of the myosin I isoforms identified by the monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies was confirmed by reprobing the nitrocellulose sheets with the complementary antibodies, i.e. first polyclonal and then monoclonal and vice versa (not shown). Thus, the 116-kDa protein appears to be present only in the cytoplasm, while the 120-kDa protein is found in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus. Immunofluorescence analysis using fluorescence and confocal microscopy showed that myosin I is located in the perinuclear region and the leading edges of migrating cells (Fig. 2) as expected from earlier work (12Wagner M.C. Barylko B. Albanesi J.P. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 163-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 13Conrad P.A. Giuliano K.A. Fisher G. Collins K. Matsudaira P.T. Taylor D.L. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 1381-1391Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The myosin I antibodies also stained the nucleus (Fig. 2). Optically sectioning cells through the nucleus using confocal microscopy demonstrated intranuclear staining (Fig. 2). The myosin I antibodies also stained the nucleoplasm of the germinal vesicle of mouse oocytes before fertilization (Fig.3 A) and the pronuclei during fertilization (Fig. 3 E). In contrast, the antibodies stained vesicles distributed throughout the cytoplasm following breakdown of the germinal vesicle (Fig. 3 C). The relocalization of myosin I to the interphase pronucleus after meiosis completion was also investigated by injecting unfertilized oocytes with either ConA or WGA and then parthenogenetically activating the oocytes. WGA, unlike ConA, blocks the completion of pronuclear formation by binding to a nucleopore glycoprotein and preventing the uptake of nonchromosomal proteins (23Finlay D.R. Newmeyer D.D. Price T.M. Forbes D.J. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 104: 189-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). WGA also blocks the movement of myosin I into the haploid female pronucleus (Fig. 3, I–L).Figure 3Localization of myosin I (A,C, E, G, I, andK) and DNA (B, D, F,H, J, and L) in oocytes.Myosin I antibodies localize to the germinal vesicle as shown by the co-localization of the myosin I staining (A) and the DNA (B) staining. Following germinal vesicle breakdown, the myosin I antibodies stain vesicles distributed throughout the cytoplasm (C), while the Hoechst dye stains chromosomes within the metaphase I spindle (D). Following fertilization, the myosin I shows strong staining in the nucleoplasm of the male and female pronuclei (E), and the Hoechst dye also stains the pronuclei (F). Panels G and H show a zygote stained with myosin I antibodies preadsorbed with adrenal myosin I (G) and with the DNA dye (H). Note the greatly reduced staining in G. Panels I–L show the effects of injecting oocytes with ConA (I and J) and WGA (K and L) on the relocation of myosin I (I and K) to reforming nuclei that are visualized by DNA staining (J and L). WGA blocks decondensation of the female pronucleus (FPn) and abolishes nuclear relocalization of myosin I (K and L), whereas ConA does not affect either process (polar body,Pb). The cells in panels I–L were fixed 8 h after parthenogenetic activation. Bar, 10 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The staining pattern seen in Fig. 2 was retained when cells were fixed in methanol (12Wagner M.C. Barylko B. Albanesi J.P. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 163-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) or fixed, permeabilized, and stained in cytoskeletal stabilizing buffer (13Conrad P.A. Giuliano K.A. Fisher G. Collins K. Matsudaira P.T. Taylor D.L. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 1381-1391Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), procedures previously used to visualize myosin I in the cytoplasm. Preadsorbing the myosin I antibodies with purified adrenal myosin I removed the staining pattern in both 3T3 cells (not shown) and oocytes (Fig. 3 G). Antibodies to myosin II, in contrast, stained stress fibers in 3T3 fibroblasts and never stained the nucleus (Fig. 2). It is noteworthy that the same secondary antibody was used to visualize the myosin I and myosin II antibodies in Fig. 2. Electron microscopy was also used to locate the protein recognized by the antibodies to adrenal myosin I (Fig. 4). These experiments clearly demonstrated the presence of immunoreactive material in the nucleoplasm of 3T3 cells (Fig. 4, top panel). Moreover, the protein recognized by the myosin I antibody co-localizes with actin in the nucleus (Fig. 4, inset). High power examination of nucleoli demonstrated that the antibody stained mainly the dense fibrillar component where transcription of rDNA takes place (Fig. 4, bottom panel). This component surrounds fibrillar centers that are rich in actin (24Dundr M. Raška I. Exp. Cell Res. 1993; 208: 275-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 25Hozak P. Cook P.R. Schofer C. Mosgoller W. Wachtler F. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 639-648PubMed Google Scholar). A calmodulin overlay assay performed on purified nuclei showed the presence of a 120-kDa protein that binds 125I-calmodulin (Fig. 5). Extracts were also prepared under nondenaturing conditions, photolabeled with [α-32P]ATP, separated by SDS-PAGE, and transferred to nitrocellulose (Fig. 5). An autoradiogram of the nitrocellulose sheet demonstrated photolabeling of a 120-kDa protein in nuclei that had been washed once or twice. Following autoradiography, the nitrocellulose sheets from the calmodulin binding and ATP photolabeling assays were probed with polyclonal antibodies to myosin I. These experiments showed that the 120-kDa proteins that bound125I-calmodulin and were photolabeled with ATP were also recognized by the antibodies to myosin I. To characterize this protein further, the 120-kDa protein was partially purified from twice washed, 3T3 nuclei using ammonium sulfate fractionation and gel filtration chromatography. Column fractions were assayed using Western blotting and K+-EDTA ATPase assays. K+-EDTA ATPase activity is an unique feature of myosin molecules that was used in the original investigation that identified myosin I in Acanthamoeba (2Pollard T.D. Korn E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 4682-4690Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 6 shows that fractions containing the 120-kDa protein also contain K+-EDTA ATPase activity. Column fractions containing the 120-kDa protein were pooled, concentrated, and tested for actin binding because members of the myosin superfamily bind actin in the absence, but not the presence, of ATP (1Hasson T. Mooseker M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16431-16434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Fig. 7 shows the 120-kDa protein binds actin in the absence, but not in the presence, of ATP. The data presented above demonstrate the following: (a) the presence of a 120-kDa protein in nuclei apparently free of cytosolic contamination that is recognized by polyclonal antibodies to adrenal myosin I; (b) immunostaining of the nucleus with affinity-purified polyclonal antibodies to adrenal myosin I that inhibit the actin-activated ATPase activity of purified adrenal myosin I; (c) differential staining of the germinal vesicle, cytoplasm, and pronuclei at various stages of mouse oocyte development; (d) co-localization of the 120-kDa protein and actin in the nucleus; (e) elimination of the nuclear staining when pronuclear formation is blocked or when the antibodies are preincubated with purified adrenal myosin I; (f) the immunoreactive 120-kDa protein binds 125I-calmodulin and is photoaffinity-labeled with ATP; (g) the presence of K+-EDTA ATPase activity in column fractions containing the 120-kDa protein following gel filtration chromatography of nuclear extracts apparently free of cytoplasmic contaminants; (h) actin binding by the 120-kDa protein in the absence, but not the presence, of ATP. K+-EDTA ATPase activity, actin, and ATP binding are defining features of the myosin superfamily of proteins, and calmodulin binding is a signature feature of all unconventional myosins (1Hasson T. Mooseker M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16431-16434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Therefore, we conclude that the 120-kDa protein is a previously undescribed myosin I isoform that localizes to the nucleus. Previous experiments have demonstrated the presence of myosin I in the leading edges of Dictyostelium amoeba (26Fukui Y. Lynch T.J. Brzeska H. Korn E.D. Nature. 1989; 341: 328-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar) and fibroblasts (12Wagner M.C. Barylko B. Albanesi J.P. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 163-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 13Conrad P.A. Giuliano K.A. Fisher G. Collins K. Matsudaira P.T. Taylor D.L. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 1381-1391Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), growth cones in neural cells (12Wagner M.C. Barylko B. Albanesi J.P. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 163-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), the tips of stereocilia in hair cells (15Gillespie P.G. Wagner M.C. Hudspeth A.J. Neuron. 1993; 11: 581-594Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), Golgi-derived vesicles from epithelial cells (14Fath K.R. Burgess D.R. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 117-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), and the midbody during cytokinesis (27Breckler J. Bernside B. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1994; 29: 312-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). These studies did not report nuclear staining, perhaps due to restricted reactivity of the antibodies used in these experiments with individual myosin I isoforms. For instance, antibodies to Acanthamoeba myosin IB do not stain structures containing myosin IC (28Miyata H. Bowers B. Korn E.D. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 1519-1528Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), and antibodies to brush border myosin I do not react with adrenal myosin I (12Wagner M.C. Barylko B. Albanesi J.P. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 163-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the polyclonal antibodies to adrenal myosin I described here have a broader range than monoclonal antibodies to adrenal myosin I (12Wagner M.C. Barylko B. Albanesi J.P. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 163-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). The monoclonal antibodies only recognize a cytosolic protein withM r 116,000, whereas the polyclonal antibodies recognize the 116-kDa protein and a protein with a slightly higher molecular weight (M r 120,000) (Fig. 1). This difference in antibody reactivity was confirmed by preparing a whole cell extract from 3T3 cells and subjecting it to ammonium sulfate fractionation and gel filtration chromatography. Column fractions were then separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and probed with either the polyclonal or the monoclonal antibodies to adrenal myosin I. This experiment (not shown) demonstrated that the monoclonal antibody recognized a protein (M r 116,00) that eluted from the column later (peak at fraction 93) than the 120-kDa protein recognized by the polyclonal antibodies (peak at fraction 81 as shown in Fig. 6, inset). Thus, the polyclonal antibodies to adrenal myosin I described in this paper apparently react with a novel myosin I isoform. Fluorescence microscopy performed on mouse oocytes double stained with the antibodies to myosin I and a DNA dye demonstrated that the myosin I antibodies stained predominantly the germinal vesicle (Fig. 3). In contrast, the 120-kDa protein associates with vesicles distributed throughout the cytoplasm following breakdown of the germinal vesicle (Fig. 3 C). Following fertilization, the myosin I staining decreases in the cytoplasm and is seen mainly in the pronuclei (Fig.3 E). This movement of myosin I into the nucleus could be blocked by microinjecting oocytes with the lectin WGA and then parthenogenetically activating the oocytes (Fig. 3 K). WGA, but not other lectins such as ConA, inhibits the uptake of nonchromosomal proteins into reforming nuclei and blocks full nuclear decondensation after telophase by binding to a 62-kDa pore glycoprotein (23Finlay D.R. Newmeyer D.D. Price T.M. Forbes D.J. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 104: 189-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). The demonstration that WGA blocks both myosin I import (Fig.3 K) and the completion of female pronuclear formation (Fig.3 L) strongly support the idea that myosin I, like other nuclear proteins (29Dean W.L. Seufert A.C. Schultz G.A. Prather R.S. Simerly C. Schatten G. Pilch D.R. Marzluff W.F. Development. 1989; 106: 325-334PubMed Google Scholar, 30Schatten G. Maul G.G. Schatten H. Chaly N. Simerly C. Balczon R. Brown D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 4727-4731Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), is a cytosolic protein in meiosis that is retargeted to the nucleus postactivation. The presence of molecular motors in the nucleus is likely for a number of reasons. Nascent DNA tightly associate with a nuclear “matrix” (31Berezney R. Coffey D.S. Science. 1975; 189: 291-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar), and the presence of a filamentous network in the nucleus has been demonstrated (31Berezney R. Coffey D.S. Science. 1975; 189: 291-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar, 32He D. Nickerson J.A. Penman S.J. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 569-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). Although there is no consensus as to the composition of this network, it has been suggested that replication occurs as templates move through replication “factories” that are attached to the nucleoskeleton (33Cook P.R. Cell. 1991; 66: 627-635Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 34Hozak P. Hassan A.B. Jackson D.A. Cook P.R. Cell. 1993; 73: 361-373Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). Transcription of ribosomal genes has been shown to take place in the “dense fibrillar component” on the surface of the fibrillar centers, and a dynamic model in which templates move through an array of RNA polymerases on the surface of the fibrillar centers has been suggested (24Dundr M. Raška I. Exp. Cell Res. 1993; 208: 275-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 25Hozak P. Cook P.R. Schofer C. Mosgoller W. Wachtler F. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 639-648PubMed Google Scholar). Here we show that these fibrillar centers are rich in actin and that the dense fibrillar component contains myosin I. The presence of actin and myosin I in the same nuclear structure is of potential importance. Actin has previously been described in the nucleus (35Bremer J.W. Busch H. Yeoman L.C. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 2013-2017Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 36Milankov K. De Boni U. Exp. Cell Res. 1993; 209: 189-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 37Sahlas D.J.

Cell Biol. 1994; 64: 348-356PubMed Google Scholar), frequently in association with the nuclear matrix (36Milankov K. De Boni U. Exp. Cell Res. 1993; 209: 189-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 37Sahlas D.J. Milankov K. Park P.C. De Boni U. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 105: 347-357Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 38Amankwah K.S. De Boni U. Exp. Cell Res. 1994; 210: 315-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) but not in association with a myosin. The presence of nucleus-specific actin-binding proteins has also been demonstrated (40Ankenbauer T. Kleinschmidt J.A. Walsh M.J. Weiner O.H. Franke W.W. Nature. 1989; 342: 822-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar,41Rimm D.L. Pollard T.D. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 585-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). It has also been suggested that actin interacts with small ribonucleoproteins in the processing and transport of RNA (37Sahlas D.J. Milankov K. Park P.C. De Boni U. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 105: 347-357Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, injection of anti-actin antibodies blocks chromosome condensation in Xenopus oocytes (42Rungger A. Rungger-Brandle E. Chaponnier C. Gabbiani G. Nature. 1979; 282: 320-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) and transcription of lampbrush chromosomes (43Scheer U. Hinssen H. Franke W.W. Jokusch B.M. Cell. 1984; 39: 111-122Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). These studies suggest that actin is involved in nuclear movements or events that require energy. Any involvement of actin in energy transduction is likely to be mediated through its association with a myosin motor. Although previous experiments have suggested the presence of myosin II-like proteins in the nucleus (36Milankov K. De Boni U. Exp. Cell Res. 1993; 209: 189-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 44Sanger J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1975; 72: 2451-2455Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 45Berrios M. Fisher P.A. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 711-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 46Berrios M. Fisher P.A. Matz E.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 219-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), myosin I is a more reasonable candidate, in many ways, to be a nuclear molecular motor. Myosin I does not have to form filaments to be biochemically or biologically active (1Hasson T. Mooseker M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16431-16434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Myosin I contains a positively charged C-terminal tail that is known to interact with phospholipids and to power the movement of membrane fragments on actin filaments (47Adams R.J. Pollard T.D. Nature. 1989; 340: 565-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Similarly, myosin I could bind to negatively charged nuclear components and power their movement by simultaneously binding to actin through the actin binding site on the head (1Hasson T. Mooseker M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16431-16434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The co-localization of myosin I and actin in the nucleoplasm and the localization of myosin I in structures in the nucleolus thought to be involved in rDNA transcription (Fig. 4) add credence to the idea that myosin I is involved in transcription.

https://openalex.org/W2317350790,"Bcl-2 inhibits apoptosis from a variety of stimuli, and a Bcl-2-binding protein BAG-1 also functions in protection from apoptosis in concert with Bcl-2. Here, we provide evidence that prolonged cell survival introduced by overexpression of Bcl-2 or BAG-1 proteins strongly promotes experimental pulmonary metastasis of melanoma B16-BL6 cells. In murine melanoma cell line B16-BL6, gene transfer-mediated expression of the Bcl-2 or BAG-1 led to prolonged cell survival against serum-starved apoptosis in vitro. The Bcl-2-expressing B16 cells, B16-Bcl-2 and the BAG-1-expressing B16 cells, B16-BAG-1 strongly enhanced pulmonary metastasis in allogenic BALB/c nude mice and whole lung weights were increased by 2.4-fold and 1.4-fold, respectively, compared with control transfectants, suggesting that Bcl-2 is a stronger positive modulator of metastasis. When the viable B16-Bcl-2 and control transfectants were injected subcutaneously into BALB/c nude mice, the colony numbers of pulmonary metastasis of the B16-Bcl-2 transfectant increased by 5.6-fold compared with the control transfectants. These enhanced metastatic potentials in the B16-Bcl-2 and the B16-BAG-1 transfectants were well correlated with anti-cell death activity against serum-starvation and enhanced cell viability on limiting dilution. Analysis of the transfectants however revealed that their growth rates, invasive ability and cell motility were not significantly altered by overexpression of either Bcl-2 or BAG-1 proteins. Taken together, these studies demonstrate that prolonged cell survival is a crucial factor to promote metastasis of melanoma, thereby contributing to tumor progression."
https://openalex.org/W2083714563,"Although regulated ectodomain shedding is a well known process that affects a large group of transmembrane molecules, it is not clear how the shedding system selects its substrates. Here we investigate the structural requirements for the regulated shedding of two substrates of the general shedding system, the transforming growth factor-α precursor, pro-TGF-α, and the β-amyloid precursor protein, β-APP. The ability of different regions of pro-TGF-α or β-APP to confer susceptibility to the shedding system was tested using as a reporter a transmembrane molecule that is not a substrate of this shedding system. For this purpose we chose the TGF-β accessory receptor, betaglycan, since genetic and biochemical evidence showed that betaglycan is not a substrate of the shedding system. We determined that replacement of the 14 extracellular amino acids adjacent to the transmembrane region of betaglycan with the corresponding regions of TGF-α or β-APP rendered betaglycan susceptible to ectodomain shedding. These domain swap constructs were cleaved in response to protein kinase C stimulation, and cleavage was prevented by the metalloprotease inhibitor TAPI, both effects being characteristic of the general shedding system. Domain swap constructs containing the transmembrane and/or the cytoplasmic domains of pro-TGF-α did not undergo regulated ectodomain cleavage. We conclude that despite a lack of sequence similarity, the extracellular regions of pro-TGF-α and β-APP immediately preceding their transmembrane domains are key determinants of ectodomain shedding.

A large, functionally and structurally heterogeneous group of transmembrane proteins can undergo cleavage and release of their extracellular domain into the medium. This proteolytic process is often referred to as “ectodomain shedding” and affects a large set of otherwise unrelated cell surface molecules such as growth factors, growth factor receptors, ectoenzymes, and cell adhesion molecules. In most cases described to date, ectodomain shedding is a regulated process that can be activated by protein kinase C (PKC) 1The abbreviations used are: PKC, protein kinase C; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; TGF, transforming growth factor; β-APP, β-amyloid precursor protein; TNF, tumor necrosis factor; PMA, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate; HA, hemagglutinin; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; BG, betaglycan; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorter; TAPI-2,N-{dl-[2-9(hydroxyaminocarbonyl)methyl]-4-methypentanoyl}-l-3-terbutyl-l-alanine, 2-aminoethyl amide. 1The abbreviations used are: PKC, protein kinase C; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; TGF, transforming growth factor; β-APP, β-amyloid precursor protein; TNF, tumor necrosis factor; PMA, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate; HA, hemagglutinin; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; BG, betaglycan; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorter; TAPI-2,N-{dl-[2-9(hydroxyaminocarbonyl)methyl]-4-methypentanoyl}-l-3-terbutyl-l-alanine, 2-aminoethyl amide. activation and other mechanisms (1Ehlers M.R.W.

Although the components of this shedding system have not been identified, recent reports have provided insights into the general characteristics of the shedding machinery. Mutant CHO cell lines selected for lack of regulated shedding of the membrane-anchored growth factor pro-TGF-α are also defective in the cleavage of unrelated molecules such as the cell adhesion molecule L-selectin, the α-receptor for interleukin-6, the β-amyloid precursor protein (β-APP), and a variety of endogenous CHO cell surface proteins (3Arribas J.

Hung M.C. Klostergaard J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8226-8233Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) has shown a lack of strict sequence specificity for cleavage. Rather, cleavage occurs at a site located at a fixed distance from the membrane (13Cheng H.J. Flanagan J.G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 943-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 16Tang P.

These observations raise questions about the role of the cleaved amino acid sequence as a determinant of cleavage specificity. To investigate these questions, we determined whether any portion of pro-TGF-α or β-APP might confer the ability to be shed to a protein that normally is not subject to the pro-TGF-α and β-APP shedding system. As the test protein we chose the TGF-β accessory receptor, betaglycan. Betaglycan is a membrane-anchored proteoglycan that binds the growth factor TGF-β and facilitates its interaction with signaling receptors (21López-Casillas F. Wrana J.L. Massagué J. Cell. 1993; 73: 1435-1444Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (774) Google Scholar). Although betaglycan can be shed, we found in the present studies that this is a very slow process that has none of the characteristics of the shedding process described above for pro-TGF-α, β-APP, and other proteins. Taking advantage of this fact, we generated chimeras between betaglycan and domains of TGF-α and β-APP and determined which domains can confer susceptibility to the shedding system. Here we report that short juxtamembrane sequences of TGF-α and β-APP endow betaglycan with the ability to be cleaved by the regulated shedding system. Phorbol-12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) and the calcium ionophore A23187 were from Sigma. TAPI-2 was kindly provided by Immunex. Wild type and CHO cell lines defective in pro-HA/TGF-α shedding have been described elsewhere (4Arribas J. Massagué J. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 433-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Wild type and mutant CHO cells were stably transfected with the pCEP-4 plasmid (Invitrogen) containing the cDNA encoding the different molecules used in this work using the calcium phosphate precipitate method. Transfectans were selected in 600 μg/ml hygromicin (Calbiochem) and subcloned. For transient transfection of L17 cells (22Carcamo J. Weis F.M. Ventura F. Wieser R. Wrana J.L. Attisano L. Massagué J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3810-3821Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the various cDNA constructs were subcloned into pCMV5 vector and transfected using the DEAE dextran method as described (22Carcamo J. Weis F.M. Ventura F. Wieser R. Wrana J.L. Attisano L. Massagué J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3810-3821Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells expressing various constructs were washed with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 1 h at 37 °C and then treated with or without 50 μm TAPI-2 for 5 min and treated with or without 1 μm PMA, 1 μm calcium ionophore A23187, or 10% fetal bovine serum and/or TAPI as indicated for additional periods of time. Cells were then incubated for 45 min at 4 °C with 10 μg/ml anti-HA monoclonal antibody (12CA5, Babco) or 10 μg/ml of anti-myc monoclonal antibody 9E10 (23Evan G.I. Lewis G.K. Ramsay G. Bishop M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 3610-3616Crossref PubMed Scopus (2165) Google Scholar) in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 5% bovine serum albumin and stained for 30 min at 4 °C with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Becton Dickinson) in PBS containing 5% bovine serum albumin. Flow cytometry was done on a FACscan instrument and software (Becton Dickinson). Approximately 2.106 exponentially growing CHO cells expressing various molecules were labeled for different periods of time with 250 or 1,000 μCi/ml [35S]cysteine and 250 or 1,000 μCi/ml Tran35S-label (NEN Life Science Products) in methionine- and cysteine-free medium at 37 °C. The label was chased in complete medium for various periods of time in the presence or absence of 50 μm TAPI-2 and/or 1 μm PMA, 1 μm calcium ionophore A23187, or 10% fetal bovine serum as indicated. Cells were then washed with cold PBS and lysed in PBS containing 1% Nonidet P-40 and 5 mm EDTA (lysis buffer). Aliquots from the media and from cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-HA (Babco) or anti-Myc monoclonal antibodies. Immune complexes were collected by incubation of cell lysates and media samples with protein A-Sepharose (for anti-HA antibody) or protein G-Sepharose (for anti-Myc antibody) for 45 min at 4 °C, washed three times with PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and 0.1% SDS, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. For quantification of secreted material, specific bands corresponding to betaglycan or pro-TGF-α were excised from the gel, counted in a Beckman scintillation counter, and the amount of secreted material expressed as percentage relative to anti-HA or anti-myc immunoprecipitable counts at the end of the chase from cell lysates. The pro-HA/TGF-α construct was described in (4Arribas J. Massagué J. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 433-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The myc/betaglycan construct (myc/BG) was generated by inserting the myc epitope (EQKLISEEDL) six codons downstream of the putative signal sequence as described previously (21López-Casillas F. Wrana J.L. Massagué J. Cell. 1993; 73: 1435-1444Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (774) Google Scholar). HpaI andClaI sites were introduced flanking the transmembrane domain of myc-tagged rat betaglycan (nucleotides 2399 and 2470 of wild type rat betaglycan, respectively) using a double-stranded oligonucleotide that replaced the original NcoI-AvrI fragment. The transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of pro-TGF-α were amplified by polymerase chain reaction using as a template wild type rat pro-TGF-α and oligonucleotides containing HpaI and/orClaI restriction sites as needed. The transmembrane, cytoplasmic, or transmembrane-cytoplasmic domains of pro-TGF-α were subcloned into a vector containing myc-tagged betaglycan with theHpaI and ClaI restriction sites using appropriate restriction enzymes. The resulting constructs were named myc/BG-Tα-BG, myc/BG-BG-Tα, and myc/BG-Tα-Tα, respectively (see Fig. 4). The juxtamembrane domains of pro-TGF-α or β-APP were introduced into myc/BG using two complementary oligonucleotides containing the coding sequence for amino acids 85–98 of rat pro-TGF-α or amino acids 592–606 of human β-APP695which were annealed and subcloned at the ends resulting from digesting a vector containing myc/BG (HpaI, ClaI) withHpaI and NcoI (located at nucleotide 2385 of the wild type betaglycan molecule). The resulting molecules contained 14 amino acids of the juxtamembrane region of pro-TGF-α (myc/BG-Tα juxt) or β-APP (myc/BG-β-APP juxt) inserted right upstream of betaglycan transmembrane domain (see Fig. 3).Figure 4Ectodomain shedding of the various chimeric molecules. L17 cells transiently transfected with vectors encoding for the different chimeric molecules were metabolically labeled for 30 min and chased in the presence or absence of PMA. At the indicated times cells were lysed, and cell lysates and media samples were immunoprecipitated with anti-Myc antibodies. Immunoprecipitates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The experiment was done three times, with the same result each time.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 3Schematic of BG/pro-TGF-α and BG/β-APP chimeric molecules.

Wrana J.L. Massagué J. Cell. 1993; 73: 1435-1444Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (774) Google Scholar, 24Andres J.L. Stanley K. Cheifetz S. Massagué J. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 3137-3145Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). However, this mechanism has been poorly characterized. To analyze the secretion of betaglycan, a vector encoding rat betaglycan tagged with a c-Myc epitope following the signal sequence was stably transfected into CHO cells. Immunoprecipitation of metabolically labeled myc/BG transfectants with anti-Myc antibody yielded two main products similar to those observed previously with wild type betaglycan. Based on previous characterization of the membrane-anchored forms (25Lopez-Casillas F. Cheifetz S. Doody J. Andres J.L. Lane W.S. Massagué J. Cell. 1991; 67: 785-795Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar), these products are identified as the heterogeneous 180–250-kDa proteoglycan form and the 110-kDa betaglycan core protein devoid of glycosaminoglycan chains (Fig. 1 A). Confirming previous results, a low level of myc/BG ectodomain was specifically immunoprecipitated from the conditioned media of these transfectants (see Fig.1 B). Ectodomain shedding can be induced by activators of PKC, calcium ionophores, or serum factors, each acting, in part, through independent mechanisms (2Massagué J. Pandiella A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 515-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar). To find out whether the secretion of betaglycan can be activated by these agents, CHO cells expressing myc/BG were treated with the PKC activator PMA, the calcium ionophore A23187, or fetal bovine serum, and the levels of betaglycan in the cells and in media were analyzed. None of these agents was able to induce a decrease in the levels of cell surface myc/BG, as determined by immunoprecipitation of metabolically labeled cell lysates (Fig. 1 A) and media (Fig. 1 B) or by FACS analysis of cell surface c-Myc immunofluorescence (Fig. 2 A). In contrast, these activators induced a marked decrease in the levels of cell surface pro-TGF-α (Figs. 1 and 2 C), as reported previously (4Arribas J. Massagué J. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 433-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The proportion of betaglycan and pro-TGF-α released into the media by metabolically labeled transfectants was determined after a 7-h chase or 1-h chase, respectively. These different time periods were chosen because the half-life of betaglycan in CHO cells (approximately 4 h) is longer than that of pro-TGF-α (approximately 1.5 h). The amount of labeled betaglycan recovered from media after the chase was only 3.5–5% of the betaglycan labeled after the pulse (Fig.1 B). This level of soluble betaglycan was not increased significantly by cell treatment with the various agents. A slight increase in secretion in PMA-treated cells observed in the experiment of Fig. 2 B was not reproducible. Under the same conditions, and in agreement with previous reports, PMA, A23187, and serum induced a nearly quantitative release of the TGF-α labeled during the pulse (Fig. 1 B). These results indicate that betaglycan ectodomain release is a slow process in CHO cells and cannot be activated by agents that typically activate the shedding of several transmembrane molecules such as pro-TGF-α. To determine whether the limited release of betaglycan is mediated by the pro-TGF-α shedding system or by a different process, we used the CHO mutant cell line M1, which is deficient in the shedding of pro-TGF-α and all proteins tested to date, including β-APP, interleukin-6 receptor, L-selectin, and various endogenous CHO cell surface molecules of unknown identity (4Arribas J. Massagué J. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 433-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). M1 cells were stably transfected with myc/BG, metabolically labeled with [35S]cysteine and [35S]methionine, and then chased with or without PMA. Betaglycan shedding in M1 cells was tested and quantified as described above for parental CHO transfectants. The amount of soluble betaglycan secreted by M1 cells was comparable to the amount of betaglycan secreted by wild type CHO cells (Fig.2 B). In contrast, TGF-α immunoprecipitation showed a failure of M1 cells to shed pro-TGF-α (Fig. 2 C), as shown previously (4Arribas J. Massagué J. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 433-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Additionally, we tested the effect of the hydroxamic acid-based inhibitor TAPI-2 on betaglycan shedding. TAPI-2 inhibits the shedding of TNF-α and most transmembrane molecules tested so far (4Arribas J. Massagué J. J.

However, TAPI-2 had no effect on the secretion of betaglycan (Fig. 2 B). Collectively, these results indicate that betaglycan ectodomain shedding in CHO cells is an inefficient process that involves a mechanism distinct from the shedding system that acts on pro-TGF-α and other transmembrane molecules. To identify regions of pro-TGF-α and β-APP which may confer susceptibility to shedding, we generated a panel of betaglycan chimeras containing various pro-TGF-α or β-APP sequences (Fig.3). The cytoplasmic domain, the transmembrane domain, or both domains of betaglycan were replaced by the complementary domains of pro-TGF-α. Additionally, we generated a betaglycan construct with a replacement of 14 juxtamembrane amino acids with the corresponding sequence from pro-TGF-α (Fig. 3). To survey the shedding of these chimeric molecules efficiently, we used a highly transfectable clone (L17) of the Mv1Lu mink lung epithelial cell line in transient transfection assays (22Carcamo J. Weis F.M. Ventura F. Wieser R. Wrana J.L. Attisano L. Massagué J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3810-3821Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Transiently transfected, metabolically labeled L17 cells were chased for different periods of time with or without PMA addition, and shedding was monitored by immunoprecipitation of metabolically labeled products. The different chimeric betaglycan molecules showed the same biosynthesis profiles as wild type betaglycan (Fig. 4 and data not shown). In the case of the constructs BG-Tα-BG, BG-BG-Tα, and BG-Tα-Tα, approximately 1% of total myc antibody-immunoprecipitable counts at the end of the pulse were released to the medium at the end of the chase, and the same result was obtained with the wild type betaglycan construct transfected under the same conditions (data not shown). The amount of released betaglycan ectodomain did not change in response to PMA. In contrast, the betaglycan construct containing the juxtamembrane domain of pro-TGF-α released significant amounts of betaglycan ectodomain into the media. Quantitation of the immunoprecipitated material indicated that 40% of the metabolically labeled betaglycan was released. Furthermore, the rate and extent of the release were increased in response to PMA (Fig. 4). These results indicate that the juxtamembrane domain of TGF-α is sufficient to confer susceptibility to the general shedding system. To confirm these results in a better controlled system, we stably transfected the construct BG-Tα juxt into CHO cells. Additionally, we generated a related construct containing the juxtamembrane 14 amino acids of β-APP (construct BG-β-APP juxt) and stably transfected this construct into CHO cells. As shown in Fig.5 A, PMA treatment of CHO cells expressing myc/BG-Tα juxt or myc/BG-β-APP juxt induced the release of the ectodomain of the chimeric molecules as detected by immunoprecipitation via the c-myc epitope. The shedding of both chimeras was abolished completely by treatment with 50 μm TAPI-2 (data not shown). We next analyzed the kinetics of ectodomain shedding of these two chimeric molecules and compared it with that of TGF-α. In agreement with previous results, the levels of cell surface pro-TGF-α decreased dramatically soon after treatment with PMA as determined by FACS analysis (Fig. 5 B). The levels of cell surface pro-TGF-α were decreased 4-fold after a 5-min of treatment with PMA and became undetectable after 10 min of PMA addition. The ectodomain of the chimeric molecules BG-Tα juxt and BG-β-APP juxt were shed from CHO cells with approximately the same kinetics as pro-TGF-α. Furthermore, upon addition of medium lacking PMA, the original levels of cell surface pro-TGF-α and BG-Tα juxt were recovered with similar kinetics (t 1/2 ∼ 2.5 h) (Fig.5 C). These results demonstrate that the juxtamembrane domains of pro-TGF-α and β-APP are similarly effective at conferring susceptibility to cleavage by the regulated shedding system. Genetic and biochemical evidence points to the existence of a general regulated ectodomain shedding system acting on a wide variety of cell surface proteins. Examination of surface-labeled membrane proteins in CHO cells indicated that the transmembrane proteins whose ectodomain is proteolytically released into the medium constitute a diverse group and account for 2–5% of the total cell surface protein in CHO cells (3Arribas J.

The vast majority of these proteins are shed in response to PKC activation, and their release is prevented by a mutation in a common component (3Arribas J. Coodly L. Vollmer P. Kishimoto T.K. Rose-John S. Massagué J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11376-11382Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). To date only two proteins, colony-stimulating factor-1 (9Müllberg J. Durie F.H. Otten-Evans C. Alderson M.R. Rose-John S. Cosman D. Black R.A. Mohler K.M. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 5198-5205PubMed Google Scholar) and betaglycan (this report), have been reported to be shed by an independent mechanism. In the present report, we show that, as in the case of colony-stimulating factor-1, the shedding of betaglycan is not stimulated by well known activators of the general shedding system and is not inhibited by the general shedding inhibitor TAPI. Furthermore, in the case of betaglycan, the rate and extent of release into the medium are very limited and not affected by mutations that disrupt the general shedding system. Since betaglycan is in principle accessible to the general shedding system, we have used it as a reporter to identify TGF-α and β-APP sequences that would confer susceptibility to the general shedding system. Using a panel of betaglycan/TGF-α chimeras, we demonstrate that the juxtamembrane 14 amino acids of pro-TGF-α, which contain the natural pro-TGF-α cleavage site, are sufficient to confer susceptibility to the general shedding system. Furthermore, since the juxtamembrane domain of β-APP is as effective as that of pro-TGF-α at supporting betaglycan shedding, we conclude that the short juxtamembrane regions of pro-TGF-α and β-APP are determinants of ectodomain shedding. In contrast to this role of the juxtamembrane region, the transmembrane region and the cytoplasmic region of pro-TGF-α, tested jointly or separately, failed to support betaglycan ectodomain cleavage. It has been noted previously that the preferred cleavage site for ectodomain shedding is located at a certain distance from the membrane. Combined with a lack of evidence that the primary sequence of the cleaved region is important for cleavage these findings have led to the notion that shedding occurs by the action of an enzyme or set of enzymes which are sterically restricted to substrates adjacent to the membrane but are otherwise broad in their sequence specificity (15Müllberg J.

The present observations clearly demonstrate that some feature of the 14 amino acid juxtamembrane sequences of pro-TGF-α and β-APP, not present in the corresponding region of betaglycan, is necessary for cleavage. No sequence similarities can be found between these juxtamembrane regions of pro-TGF-α and β-APP except for the presence of a cluster of hydrophobic amino acids at or following the cleavage sites (see Fig. 4). However, mutations in this hydrophobic cluster have limited effect on the shedding of pro-TGF-α (27Wong S.T. Winchell L.F. McCune B.K. Earp H.S. Teixidó J. Massagué J. Herman B. Lee D.C. Cell. 1989; 56: 495-506Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar), suggesting that this feature is not sufficient for recognition by the shedding system. It is therefore possible that the key determinant is in the as yet unknown secondary structure of this region. Alternatively, it is conceivable that this region in pro-TGF-α, β-APP, and other shed proteins might be disordered, and a lack of secondary structure renders them susceptible to the shedding system. Previous reports have emphasized the importance of the β-APP membrane proximal segment on the basal cleavage of this molecule (20Sisodia S.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6075-6079Crossref PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar, 28Sisodia S.S. Koo E.H. Beyreuther K. Unterbeck A. Price D.L. Science. 1990; 248: 492-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (745) Google Scholar), and recently it has been proposed that PKC activators enhance secretion of β-APP by enhancing budding of transport vesicles from thetrans-Golgi network (29Xu H. Greengard P. Gandy S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 270: 23243-23245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Our observation that the juxtamembrane domain of β-APP introduced in betaglycan is sufficient to allow induced shedding of the chimeric molecule suggests that the proteolytic component of the β-APP shedding enzyme, often referred to as α-secretase, is activated via PKC. Stimulation of β-APP transport to the cell surface and activation of the α-secretase-mediated shedding are therefore two distinct and complementary mechanisms for activation of β-APP release by PKC. In summary, our evidence suggests that a general shedding system regulated via PKC acts on diverse transmembrane proteins and selects their targets by recognition of a certain secondary structure (or a lack thereof) located in the juxtamembrane domain. Although the diversity of sequences cleaved by this system suggests the involvement of multiple proteases, it would appear from the present observations and previous results with hydroxamic acid inhibitors that these enzymes may be structurally and functionally related to each other."

EC 3.1.1.4) are a group of enzymes that catalyze the hydrolysis of the sn-2-ester bond of phospholipids, resulting in the production of free fatty acid and lysophospholipids. These lipid products may serve as intracellular second messengers or can be further metabolized to potent inflammatory mediators. The release of arachidonic acid (AA) from membranes by PLA2 and its subsequent conversion into leukotrienes, prostaglandins, and other eicosanoids play a key role in the process leading to inflammation. Several mammalian PLA2s, including the 14-kDa secreted form PLA2 and the 85-kDa cytosolic PLA2 (cPLA2), have been proposed to mediate AA release and eicosanoid generation in various cell types (1Mayer R.J. Marshall L.A. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 339-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar, 2Mukherjee A.B. Miele L. Pattabiraman N. Biochem.

The mammalian low molecular mass 14-kDa PLA2s mainly include two types, type I and type II. Although the type I PLA2 is mainly found in pancreatic secretion, it has also been found in other mammalian tissues, and the physiological role of this extra-pancreatic type I PLA2 remains unclear. The type II PLA2 has been suggested to be involved in the pathogenesis of inflammatory reactions (1Mayer R.J. Marshall L.A. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 339-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar, 2Mukherjee A.B. Miele L. Pattabiraman N. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1994; 48: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). It is found associated with several cells and tissues or is present extracellularly when released in response to proinflammatory mediators such as interleukin-1, interleukin-6, or tumor necrosis factor. The soluble type II 14-kDa PLA2 found in inflammatory fluids, tissue exudates, or serum has been suggested to propagate inflammation through membrane digestion and liberation of proinflammatory lipid mediators. The cell-associated type II PLA2 has been assumed to release AA for lipid mediator generation (1Mayer R.J. Marshall L.A. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 339-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar, 2Mukherjee A.B. Miele L. Pattabiraman N. Biochem.

However, because the 14-kDa PLA2 lacks selectivity for the sn-2 fatty acids of phospholipids and requires much higher Ca2+(mm) than normal cellular Ca2+ level (nm–μm) for activation, it was not certain whether this type of PLA2 contributes to the release of AA and production of eicosanoids. Studies using antisense inhibition and selective inhibitors of different forms of PLA2s have demonstrated that the type II PLA2 participates in AA release and prostaglandin generation in the P388D1macrophages (4Barbour S.E.

These findings have established an important role of the 14-kDa PLA2 for AA metabolism.

The cPLA2 has two functionally distinct regions, the NH2-terminal region (amino acids 1–178) containing the homologous Ca2+-dependent lipid binding motif (amino acid 36–81) and the COOH-terminal region (amino acids 179–749) containing the catalytic domain (8Clark J.D.

The NH2-terminal region Ca2+-dependent lipid binding motif mediates the Ca2+-dependent translocation of cPLA2 from cytosol to membrane substrate. The COOH-terminal region mediates the Ca2+-independent enzyme catalysis, which likely involves Ser-228 at the active site (28Sharp J.D. Pickard R.T. Chiou X.G. Manetta J.V. Kovacevic S. Miller J.R.

Thus, both the calcium-dependent translocation mediated by the NH2-terminal Ca2+-dependent lipid binding domain and phosphorylation of the COOH-terminal region play an important regulatory role in the activation of cPLA2 and regulation of AA release. In an effort to further investigate the regulation of the 85-kDa cPLA2, this study was designed to identify proteins interacting with the NH2-terminal or COOH-terminal region of cPLA2 protein by screening a human cDNA library using the yeast two hybrid system. An 11-kDa protein (p11), the unique member of S100 family of calcium-binding proteins, was found to interact with the COOH-terminal region of cPLA2. Further studies demonstrated that p11 associated with cPLA2 and inhibited the cPLA2 activity in vitro. The p11-cPLA2 complex was precipitated from a human bronchial epithelial cell line (BEAS 2B cell) expressing both p11 and cPLA2. Reduction of p11 expression in the BEAS 2B cells by antisense RNA reversed the inhibition of p11 on cPLA2, which resulted in an increased PLA2 activity as well as an increased AA release. This study revealed a previously unrecognized mechanism of cPLA2 regulation by the S100 protein family. Plasmid pGBT9 (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA), containing the sequences for the GAL4 DNA-binding domain (amino acids 1–147) as well as sequences for tryptophan (TRP1), was used to express the fusion proteins. Two cPLA2 cDNA fragments (540 bp corresponding to the NH2 terminus and 1707 bp corresponding to the COOH terminus) were amplified by polymerase chain reaction using human cPLA2 cDNA plasmid as the template (8Clark J.D.

The obtained cPLA2 cDNA fragments were cloned into pGBT9 vector in the correct orientation and with the correct reading frame to express the GAL4-cPLA2fusion proteins. To obtain the cPLA2 cDNA fragments, two primer pairs were synthesized according to the cPLA2cDNA sequence (8Clark J.D. Lin L.L. Kriz R.W. Ramesha C.S. Sultzman L.A. Lin A.Y. Milona N. Knopf J.L.

The primer pair for the 540-bp cPLA2cDNA fragment was composed of the following sequences: 5′ primer-GTCGACTGATGTCATTTATAGATCCTTACCAGCAC (starting from the translation start site; corresponding to the +1 to +27 of the coding region; containing the underlined SalI site and TG dinucleotides for in frame cloning); 3′ primer-GTCGACTCCTTCACTATTCTTTGGACCCAAGAGTTT (corresponding to the +540 to +511 of the coding region; containing the underlinedSalI site).

The cDNA was amplified via polymerase chain reaction utilizing Thermus aquaticus DNA polymerase. The amplified fragments were initially cloned into the pCRTM3 vector using the TA cloning kit (Invitrogen). The inserts were then released from the pCRTM3 vector by restriction enzyme digestion withSalI and were cloned into the pGBT9 vector. The identity and orientation of the constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing. The plasmid containing the 540-bp cPLA2 cDNA fragment corresponding to the NH2-terminal cPLA2 protein was designated as plasmid pGBT9-cPLA2N. The plasmid containing the 1707-bp cPLA2 cDNA fragment corresponding to the COOH-terminal cPLA2 protein was designated as plasmid pGBT9-cPLA2C. These plasmids were used to transform host HF7c cells. The transformants containing the pGBT9-cPLA2N or pGBT9-cPLA2C were selected for tryptophan prototrophy and examined for β-galactosidase activity using a filter assay. The β-galactosidase activity was undetectable in colonies containing only pGBT9-cPLA2N or pGBT9-cPLA2C. The HF7c cells containing pGBT9-cPLA2N or pGBT9-cPLA2C were then lysed for Western blotting analysis using the rabbit anti-cPLA2antibody (Genetics Institute, Boston, MA). The identity of the expressed fusion proteins was confirmed by the observation that both the NH2-terminal cPLA2 fusion protein (approximately 40 kDa) and COOH-terminal cPLA2 fusion protein (approximately 90 kDa) reacted with the polyclonal anti-cPLA2 antibody. A human leukocyte MATCHMAKER cDNA library constructed in pGAD10 plasmid (CLONTECH) was screened to identify proteins interacting with cPLA2. The Saccharomyces cerevisiae HF7c reporter strain was used for transformation with the library and plasmid pGBT9-cPLA2N or plasmid pGBT9-cPLA2C by the lithium/acetate method (31Gietz D. St. Jean A. Woods R.A. Schiestl R.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (2863) Google Scholar). The HF7c yeast cells were sequentially transformed with pGBT9-cPLA2N or pGBT9-cPLA2C followed by transformation with DNA from the MATCHMAKER human leukocyte cDNA library. Double transformants were plated in the SD synthetic medium lacking histidine, tryptophan, and leucine at a density of approximately 10,000 colonies per 150-mm plate (20 plates for each of pGBT9-cPLA2N and pGBT9-cPLA2C). Colonies appeared after incubation at 30 °C for 3 days. The colonies were transferred to VWR grade 413 paper filters and assayed for β-galactosidase activity using 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactoside (X-Gal) as substrate. Filters were placed in liquid nitrogen for 30 s, thawed at room temperature, and then incubated in buffer containing X-Gal. If transformants expressed β-galactosidase activity, the X-Gal was cleaved and colony replicates turned blue. Positive colonies were purified by restreaking on selection medium, and well isolated colonies were reassayed for β-galactosidase activity. Plasmids encoding the candidate interacting GAL4 activation domain/cPLA2 binding protein were extracted from the positive HF7c clones using a previously described method (32Hoffman C.S. Winston F. Gene ( Amst .). 1987; 57: 267-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (2021) Google Scholar). The extracted plasmid DNA was transformed to an Escherichia colistrain (HB101) carrying a leuB mutation to select the activation domain hybrid plasmid that contains yeast LEU2gene. The transformed E. coli cells were plated on M9 agar medium containing a 1 × mixture of amino acids (lacking leucine), 50 μg/ml ampicillin, 40 μg/ml proline, and 1 mmthiamine HCl. Individual colonies were isolated, and the plasmid DNA was extracted using a standard plasmid mini-prep procedure (33Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 1.25-1.31Google Scholar). Initial sequence of the cDNA inserts was obtained by dideoxy sequencing using a 17-mer oligonucleotide primer (5′-TACCACTACAATGGATG-3′), which corresponds to the GAL4 activation domain sequences and reads toward the junction of the GAL4 activation domain and the cloned candidate interacting protein. Specific oligonucleotide primers corresponding to the insert sequence were subsequently generated to obtain the full-length sequence of the inserts. To construct plasmid for p11 protein expression in bacteria, human p11 cDNA was amplified by reverse transcription and polymerase chain reaction using human lung poly(A)+ RNA. The primer pair, synthesized according to the human p11 cDNA sequence (34Kube E. Weber K. Gerke V. Gene ( Amst .). 1991; 102: 255-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), was composed of the following sequences: 5′ primer-GGATCCCCATCTCAAATGGAACACGCCATG (corresponding to 115–138 of the cDNA sequence; adjacent to the translation start site; containing the underlined BamHI site) and 3′ primer-CTCGAGTATCAGGGAGGAGCGAACTGCTCA (corresponding to 413–436 of the cDNA sequence; located in 3′-untranslated region; containing the underlined XhoI site). The amplified fragments were initially cloned into the pCRTM3 vector using the TA cloning kit. The inserts were then released from the pCRTM3 vector by restriction enzyme digestion (BamHI and XhoI) and subsequently cloned into the prokaryotic expression vector pET30a (Novagen), giving rise to p11-pET30a. The identity and orientation of the construct was confirmed by DNA sequencing. The pET30a-p11 vector expressed p11 protein as a fusion protein containing a stretch of 6 consecutive histidine residues (His-tag) at the NH2 terminus. The His-tag, removable by digestion with protease (e.g. enterokinase), was used for efficient purification of the recombinant p11 proteins under gentle, native conditions for maintaining activity of soluble proteins (35Arnold F.H. Bio/Technology. 1991; 9: 151-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). The plasmid was transformed into E. coli strain BL21 (DE3), a lon mutant strain containing the T7 polymerase under the control lacUV5 promoter. Addition of isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside induces the expression of p11. The expressed p11 was purified using histidine-binding resin (Novagen) according to the manufacturer's instruction. The His-tag-p11 was digested with enterokinase, and the released p11 without His-tag was collected and further purified by gel filtration using Bio-Gel P-30 (Fig. 1). The purified p11 was used for subsequent studies of the regulatory effects of p11 on cPLA2 enzyme activity. As the in vitro assayed cPLA2 activity is dependent on the composition of the liposome (36Diez E. Louis-Flamberg P. Hall R.H. Mayer R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18342-18348Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we used the natural membrane vesicles prepared from the BEAS 2B cells as cPLA2 substrate. To obtain the natural membrane vesicles, the BEAS 2B cells grown in 175-cm2flasks were labeled with [5,6,8,9,11,12,14,15-3H]arachidonic acid (214 Ci/mmol) in LHC-8 media. As incorporation of AA to membrane phospholipid classes may be dependent on the length of labeling period, the cells were labeled twice with [3H]AA (18-h and 10-min labeling periods) to ensure even distribution of radiolabeled AA in various classes of phospholipids (5Balsinde J. Barbour S.E. Bianco I.D. Dennis E.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11060-11064Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 6Balsinde J. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6758-6765Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar, 37Fonteh A.N. Chilton F.H. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 563-570PubMed Google Scholar). The cells were first labeled with [3H]AA for 18 h to allow [3H]AA to equilibrate among phospholipids. Under these conditions, phosphatidylethanolamine accounts for the majority of esterified [3H]AA in phospholipids, the remainder being esterified in phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylinositol, and phosphatidylserine. After the 18-h labeling period, the cells were labeled again with [3H]AA for 10 min. At this short labeling term, the distribution of AA esterified in phospholipids differs from that seen at long incubation times in that phosphatidylcholine, not phosphatidylethanolamine, is the phospholipid that incorporates most of the radiolabeled AA. The dual-labeled cells were harvested and resuspended in 0.5 ml of homogenization buffer (50 mmHEPES, pH 7.4, 1 mm EGTA, 50 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μm phosphoramidon, 10 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, 100 μg/ml aprotinin). Cells were disrupted by repeated freeze/thaw cycles. The lysate was centrifuged at 1000 ×g for 5 min to remove nuclei, unbroken cells, and debris. The low speed supernatant was then centrifuged at 100,000 ×g for 1 h to produce a crude cytosolic fraction (supernatant) and a membrane fraction (pellet). The crude cytosol was discarded, and the pellet was washed once, resuspended in 50 mm HEPES buffer (pH 7.4, without EGTA and protease inhibitors), and stored in aliquots at −80 °C for future use as cPLA2 substrate. Membrane phospholipid concentration was estimated after separation of phospholipids by thin layer chromatography on a silica gel G plate (Alltech, Dearfield, IL) developed with chloroform/methanol/acetic acid/water, 50:30:8:4, using standards of phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylethanolamine, and phosphatidylinositol (Sigma). The phospholipids were visualized by development with 2,7-dichlorofluorescein (Aldrich). In vitro cPLA2 activity was measured using3H-labeled BEAS 2B cell membrane (7.5 × 103 dpm/6.5 μg protein/assay) and purified human cPLA2 in a final volume of 100 μl (50 mmHEPES buffer, pH 7.4). The cPLA2 was kindly provided by the Genetics Institute and is purified from U937 cells. For accurate control of the Ca2+ concentration, a CaCl2/EGTA buffering system was used (38Durham A.C. Cell Calcium. 1983; 4: 33-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). As the physiological cellular Ca2+ level is normally at micromolar level (0.1 μm in normal resting cells and 0.3–1.0 μmin activated cells) and the cPLA2 activity is measurable under micromolar concentrations of Ca2+, a physiologically relevant Ca2+ concentration (0.5 μm free Ca2+) was used for all the assays (1 mm EGTA and 0.96 mm CaCl2). The reaction was started by the addition of substrate to the reaction mixture. The assays were then incubated at 37 °C for 1 h and terminated by the addition of 300 μl of 2:1 chloroform/methanol containing 1% acetic acid and 1 mg/ml free AA. Release of free fatty acid was analyzed using silica gel H thin layer chromatography plates as described previously (23Wu T. Levine S.J. Lawrence M.G. Angus C.W. Shelhamer J.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 93: 571-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 24Wu T. Ikezono T. Angus C.W. Shelhamer J.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1310: 175-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The effect of p11 was expressed as a percent of the arachidonate liberated by cPLA2 alone in each experiment (500–580 dpm). The35S-labeled p11 (carrying the His-tag at the NH2-terminal) was synthesized from the pET30a-p11 vector by the coupled in vitro transcription and translation using the Single Tube Protein™ System 2 (Novagen). For each synthesis reaction, 0.5 μg of pET30a-p11 plasmid template was transcribed in 10 μl at 30 °C for 15 min, followed by the addition of 40 μl of translation mixture with [35S]methionine and continued incubation for 60 min. Products from individual synthesis reactions were pooled and stored in aliquots at −20 °C for future use. To allow formation of the p11-cPLA2 complex, 5 μl of the synthesized [35S]p11 (3.4 × 106 dpm) was incubated with 100 ng of purified human cPLA2 in 1 ml of HBSS (with calcium and magnesium) at 4 °C for 30 min. The cPLA2 was provided by Genetics Institute, Boston, MA, and is purified from U937 cells. 10 μl of rabbit anti-human cPLA2 antibody (Genetics Institute) and 25 μl of Protein G Plus/Protein A-agarose (Pierce) were then added, and the mixture was incubated at 4 °C on a rotating device for 4 h, followed by centrifugation in a microcentrifuge at 2500 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was aspirated, and the pellet was washed four times with 1.0 ml of PBSTDS (1 × phosphate-buffered saline, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, and 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate) by repeated centrifugation. Following four washings with PBSTDS, 20 μl of protein loading buffer was added to the pellet, and the sample was boiled for 10 min before electrophoresis on 18% polyacrylamide gels (Novex, San Diego, CA) using Tris glycine/SDS buffer. The gel was then dried under vacuum and exposed to the x-ray film. For isolation of the crude cytosolic proteins, the BEAS 2B cells grown on 175-cm2 culture flasks were digested with 0.1% collagenase for 10 min. The cells were then lysed in 0.5 ml of homogenization buffer containing 1 mm EGTA and protease inhibitors, and the crude cytosolic protein was isolated as described above. The crude cytosolic samples isolated from individual flasks were pooled and stored in aliquots at −80 °C for future use. For immunoprecipitation, the isolated crude cytosolic fraction (100 μl, 200 μg of protein) was added to an Eppendorf tube containing 1 ml of HBSS (with calcium and magnesium) and 10 μl of rabbit anti-human cPLA2 antibody. The samples were preincubated at 4 °C for 30 min. 25 μl of Protein G Plus/Protein A-agarose was then added to each sample, and the mixture was incubated at 4 °C on rotating devices for 4 h, followed by centrifugation in a microcentrifuge at 2500 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was aspirated, and the pellet was washed four times with 1.0 ml of PBSTDS by repeating centrifugation. Following four washings with PBSTDS, 20 μl of protein loading buffer was added to the pellet, and the sample was boiled for 10 min before electrophoresis on 16% polyacrylamide gels (Novex) using Tris glycine/SDS buffer. The separated proteins were electrophoretically transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane, which was blocked with 5% nonfat milk overnight, and then probed with a 1:1000 dilution of mouse anti-p11 monoclonal antibody. The blots were then probed with a 1:1000 dilution of horseradish peroxidase-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG and detected using the enhanced chemiluminescence Western Blotting Detection System. Crude cytosolic extracts were prepared as described above using BEAS 2B cells. 100 μl (200 μg, protein) of the cytosol was immunoprecipitated with 2.5 mg of mouse anti-p11 monoclonal antibody (Transduction Science) and Protein G/P"

https://openalex.org/W2052953259,"To determine the contribution of muscle lipoprotein lipase (LPL) to lipoprotein metabolism, induced mutant mice were generated that express human LPL exclusively in muscle. By cross-breeding heterozygous LPL knockout mice with transgenic mice expressing human LPL only in muscle, animals were obtained that express human LPL primarily in skeletal muscle on either the null (L0-MCK) or normal (L2-MCK) LPL backgrounds, and these were compared with control littermates (L2). Fed and fasted post-heparin plasma (PHP) LPL activities were increased 1.4- and 2.3-fold, respectively, in L2-MCK mice and were normal in L0-MCK mice compared with controls. The specific enzyme activities of human LPL in mouse plasma was comparable to human LPL in human PHP. Skeletal muscle LPL activity was increased in both L2-MCK and L0-MCK mice in the fed (6.6-fold) and fasted (4.2-fold in L2-MCK; and 3.4-fold in L0-MCK) states. Adipose tissue LPL mRNA and activity were not detectable in L0-MCK mice. Growth and body mass composition were similar among all groups. In the fasted and fed state, L2-MCK mice had 31% and 53% reductions, respectively, in plasma triglycerides (TG), compatible with increased PHP LPL activity. Unexpectedly, both in the fasted and fed state the L0-MCK mice also had reduced TG (22%), despite normal PHP LPL activities. Very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) turnover studies revealed that the decreased TG were due to increased particle fractional catabolic rate in both L2-MCK and L0-MCK mice. Despite reduced TG, both L2-MCK and L0-MCK mice showed reduced high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels (16% and 19%, respectively). HDL turnover studies indicated increased HDL cholesteryl ester fractional catabolic rate in the L2-MCK and L0-MCK compared with control mice. In summary, these studies suggest that muscle LPL is particularly potent with regard to VLDL metabolism and is sufficient to compensate for the lack of LPL in other tissues with regard to lipolyzing VLDL particles. With regard to HDL, muscle LPL expression does not result in normal levels due to enhanced breakdown either by mediating accelerated HDL clearance or by failing to establish normal HDL particles that are then cleared more quickly than normal.

It is synthesized in most extrahepatic tissues and is transported to the capillary endothelium where it hydrolyzes triglycerides (TG) contained in circulating chylomicron and VLDL particles (for review, see Refs. 1Goldberg I.J.

The highest levels of LPL expression are in adipose tissue (AT) and muscle, where the liberated free fatty acids (FFAs) enter either storage (4Cryer A. Reprod. Nat. Dev. 1985; 25: 255-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) or oxidative (5Rogers M.P. Robinson D.S. J. Lipid Res. 1974; 15: 263-272Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) pathways, respectively. In addition, LPL-mediated lipolysis promotes the exchange of lipids and surface apolipoproteins between lipoprotein particles, thereby affecting the size, amount, and metabolism of not only TG-rich lipoproteins but of LDL and HDL as well (6Eisenberg S. J. Lipid Res. 1984; 25: 1017-1058Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). More recently, in vitro studies have shown that LPL can bridge lipoproteins to proteoglycan matrices on cell surfaces and/or can serve as a ligand for lipoprotein receptors (7Eisenberg S. Sehayek E. Olivecrona T. Vlodavsky I. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 2013-2021Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 8Saxena U. Klein M.G. Vanni T.M. Goldberg I.J. J. Clin.

Chem. 1992; 267: 25764-25767Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, whether this occurs in vivo has yet to be determined. The LPL protein is encoded by a single gene on chromosome 8 (9Wion K.L Kirchgessner T.G. Lusis A.J. Schotz M.C. Lawn R.M. Science. 1987; 235: 1638-1641Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar, 10Zechner R. Newman C. Steiner E. Breslow J.L. Genomics. 1991; 11: 62-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), which produces a structurally similar enzyme in all tissues thus far examined. However, differences exist between tissues with regard to the regulation of LPL expression and activity, implying differences in function. For example, during fasting the enzyme is markedly down-regulated in AT but is unchanged or even induced in skeletal (SM) and cardiac (CM) muscle, whereas the opposite occurs in the fed state (11Schotz M.C. Garfinkel A.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1972; 270: 472-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 12Borensztajn J. Otways S. Robinson J.S. J. Lipid Res. 1970; 11: 102-110Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is thought that in fasting this directs fat calories to muscle to serve as fuel and at times of feeding this promotes fat storage in adipose tissue. It has been proposed that dysregulation of this process could lead to weight loss or obesity depending on the balance between LPL expression in the muscle and AT (13Gruen R. Hietanen E. Greenwood M.R.C. Metabolism. 1979; 27: 1955-1966Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 14Eckel R. Borensztajn J. Lipoprotein Lipase.

Based on traditional systems, there is very little information about the role of tissue-specific expression of LPL on lipoprotein metabolism. Induced mutant mice provide an opportunity to test the role of tissue-specific expression of LPL on lipoprotein metabolism. We have previously generated both LPL knockout (17Weinstock P.H. Bisgaier C.L. Aalto-Setälä K.A. Radner H. Ramakrishnan R. Levak-Frank S. Essenberg A.D. Zechner R. Breslow J.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 2555-2568Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar) as well as transgenic mice overexpressing LPL specifically in both skeletal and cardiac muscle (18Levak-Frank S. Radner H. Walsh A. Stollberger R. Knipping G. Hoefler G. Sattler W. Weinstock P.H. Breslow J.L. Zechner R. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 976-986Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Total LPL deficiency leads to lethal hypertriglyceridemia within 18 h of life, at which point knockout mice demonstrate absence of HDL cholesterol (HDL-C) as well as markedly reduced intracellular lipid stores. Mice that overexpress LPL in both SM and CM on the otherwise normal LPL background have, proportional to the level of LPL transgene expression, increases in muscle FFA concentrations, metabolic organelles (mitochondria, peroxisomes), and rate of development of myopathy. These data taken together provided strong evidence for LPL as a vital gatekeeper for the entry of FFA into tissues and, more specifically, proved that excess FFA can be successfully targeted to a given tissue via changes in LPL expression alone. To further investigate the tissue-specific role(s) of muscle LPL in the absence of LPL in any other tissue, we have cross-bred the muscle-specific transgene onto the LPL knockout background, thereby producing mice that express LPL exclusively in muscle tissues (L0-MCK). Unlike LPL knockout mice, L0-MCK mice demonstrated normal growth, body mass composition, and life spans. Despite normal PHP LPL activities, L0-MCK mice had increased VLDL fractional catabolic rates (FCR) and reduced plasma TG levels. However, even though sufficient muscle LPL activity existed to actually decrease TG, HDL-C levels were decreased due to increased HDL FCR. We have previously reported both heterozygous LPL knockout mice (mL1, 129/b6 strain; Ref.17Weinstock P.H. Bisgaier C.L. Aalto-Setälä K.A. Radner H. Ramakrishnan R. Levak-Frank S. Essenberg A.D.

Three lines of transgenic mice were studied with low, medium, and high transgene expression. These lines were designated MCK-L, MCK-M, and MCK-H, respectively. All three lines only expressed human LPL mRNA in SM and CM, but in no other tissues. The MCK-L line was used in the current studies since these animals do not develop the myopathy seen in mice of the higher expressing MCK-M and H lines. The MCK-L line has been more descriptively renamed mL2/MCK-hLPL to delineate that these mice carry the human transgene (MCK-hLPL) on a background of two intact mouse LPL alleles (mL2). As shown in Table I, mL1 and mL2/MCK-hLPL were cross-bred to obtain LPL knockout heterozygotes which contained the muscle-specific transgene (mL1/MCK-hLPL). mL1/MCK-hLPL mice were then backcrossed with mL1 mice to produce the following littermates: mL2 mice (renamed L2) containing two functional copies of the mouse LPL gene with no transgene integration to serve as controls, mL2/MCK-hLPL mice (renamedL2-MCK) containing two functional copies of the mouse LPL gene with the addition of trangene expression in muscle, and mL0/MCK-hLPL mice (renamed L0-MCK) containing two disrupted copies of the mouse LPL gene with the addition of trangene expression in muscle.Table IBreeding strategy to obtain transgenic mouse lines that lack the endogenous LPL geneMating 1:mL1 × mL2/MCK-hLPL1-amL2, wild type; mL1, heterozygous LPL-null; mL0, homozygous LPL-null; MCK-hLPL, muscle-specific human LPL minigene driven by the MCK promoter.Progeny:mL2mL2/MCK-hLPLmL1mL1/MCK-hLPLMating 2:mL1/MCK-hLPL × mL1Progeny:mL2(L2)mL2/MCK-hLPL(L2-MCK)mL1mL1/MCK-hLPLmL0(L0)mL0/MCK-hLPL(L0-MCK)L2 mice contain two functional copies of the mouse LPL gene with no transgene integration and serve as controls, L2-MCK contain two functional copies of the mouse LPL gene with the addition of human LPL transgene expression in muscle, and L0-MCK contain two disrupted copies of the mouse LPL gene with the addition of human LPL transgene expression in muscle.1-a mL2, wild type; mL1, heterozygous LPL-null; mL0, homozygous LPL-null; MCK-hLPL, muscle-specific human LPL minigene driven by the MCK promoter. Open table in a new tab L2 mice contain two functional copies of the mouse LPL gene with no transgene integration and serve as controls, L2-MCK contain two functional copies of the mouse LPL gene with the addition of human LPL transgene expression in muscle, and L0-MCK contain two disrupted copies of the mouse LPL gene with the addition of human LPL transgene expression in muscle. During all breeding experiments, genotypes were determined by double PCR analysis of genomic DNA isolated from tail tips as shown in Fig. 1. To detect the human LPL transgene, primers were used that amplified the region of the LPL minigene construction corresponding to the 5′ 410 bp of the LPL cDNA (Fig. 1 A). The primers used in the reaction were: I, 5′-GTTACCGTCCAGCCATGGATCACCA-3′ and II, 5′-CCTCAAGGGAAAGCTGCCCAC-3′. PCR conditions in a reaction volume of 50 μl were as follows: 200–300 ng of tail-tipped DNA, 250 ng of each primer, 0.02 mm dNTPs, 1 unit of DynaZyme II DNA polymerase, denaturation at 94 °C for 1 min, annealing at 58 °C for 1 min, and extension at 72 °C for 90 s for a total of 30 cycles. To determine the genotype at the mouse LPL locus, a three-primer PCR strategy was employed. The following primers were used: A, 5′-CTCGCTGGCACCGTTGAGCCTCGTTACCG-3′ B, 5′-ACTGGAGCGCGGTGGAGCGCCGTAGGGCA-3′ C, 5′-GCGGGGCGGGGGGGAACTTCCTGACTAGGGGGG-3′. Primers A and B produced an amplified band of 250 bp only in the presence of intact mouse LPL alleles. Primers A and C produced a 400-bp amplification product when at least one mouse LPL allele was disrupted by the neo gene (Fig. 1 B). Heterozygous animals exhibited both bands after amplification. PCR conditions in a reaction volume of 50 μl were as follows: 200–300 ng of tail-tipped DNA, 250 ng of each primer, 0.02 mm dNTPs, 1 unit of DynaZyme II DNA polymerase, denaturation at 95 °C for 5 min for a 1 cycle, denaturation at 94 °C for 1 min, annealing and extension at 72 °C for 3 min for a total of 45 cycles. In both reactions PCR buffer was used containing 200 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 250 mm KCl, 20 mm MgCl2, and 0.1% BSA. RNA was prepared, via the acid guanidium thiocyanate-phenol chloroform extraction method of Chomczynski and Sacchi (19Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63145) Google Scholar), from SM, CM, and AT obtained from fed mice from all groups. For Northern blot analysis, 10 μg of total RNA was separated by 1% formaldehyde-agarose gel electrophoresis and subsequently blotted on a nylon membrane (Hybond N+, Amersham). The blot was prehybridized for 6 h at 65 °C and hybridized overnight at 65 °C in a buffer containing 0.15 m sodium phosphate (pH 7.2), 1 mm EDTA, 7% SDS, and 1% BSA. To detect mouse LPL mRNA, a 1.6-kb EcoRI-DraI fragment from the mouse LPL cDNA was used as a probe. To differentiate human LPL mRNA from the endogenous mouse mRNA, a species-specific DNA-probe containing a 1-kb EcoRI fragment from exon 10 of the human LPL gene was used (18Levak-Frank S. Radner H. Walsh A. Stollberger R. Knipping G. Hoefler G. Sattler W. Weinstock P.H. Breslow J.L. Zechner R. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 976-986Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). LPL activity in tissue and PHP was determined in 3-month-old male mice. Enzyme activities were determined in both the fed and the fasted states. Animals were fasted by removing the food at 8 a.m. and performing the analysis at 5 p.m. Mice were injected intraperitoneally with sodium heparin (1 unit/g body weight), and post-heparin plasma was taken 20 min after injection. The epididymal fat pads, heart, and skeletal muscle specimens (100 mg each) were surgically removed from the animals and put into ice-cold tubes containing 1 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 2% BSA and 2 units/ml heparin. After mincing the tissue with scissors, it was incubated in medium for 1 h at 37 °C. Enzyme activities of LPL in muscle tissue and adipose tissue as well as LPL and hepatic triglyceride lipase in PHP of mice was assayed as described earlier (18Levak-Frank S. Radner H. Walsh A. Stollberger R. Knipping G. Hoefler G. Sattler W. Weinstock P.H. Breslow J.L. Zechner R. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 976-986Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). The assay of PHP-lipolytic activities was performed in the presence or absence of 1 m NaCl to estimate both the LPL and HL activities. LPL activity was calculated as the portion of total lipase activity inhibited by 1 m NaCl. To differentiate between human and mouse LPL activity in post-heparin plasma and tissue extracts, the assay mixtures were preincubated for 1 h at 4 °C in the presence of or absence of 0.1 μg of monoclonal antibody 5D2 (kindly provided by Dr. J. D. Brunzell, University of Washington, Seattle, WA) (20Babirak S.P. Iverius P.H. Fujimoto W.Y. Brunzell J.D. Arteriosclerosis. 1989; 9: 326-334Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This antibody specifically inhibits the human but not the mouse enzyme in the LPL assay. Specific enzyme activities were calculated in milliunits/ng of LPL protein. One milliunit of enzyme activity corresponds to 1 μm FFA released in 1 min. Protein mass of human LPL was determined by a commercially available ELISA kit (MARKIT-LPL, Dainippon Pharmaceuticals Co. Ltd., Osaka, Japan). The protocol provided by the manufacturer was followed. Male mice were fed a regular mouse chow (4.5% fat) diet. Blood was taken at 8 a.m. with the animals having free access to food (fed samples) and in the evening after they had fasted 8 h during the day (fasted samples). The HDL fraction of plasma was isolated by using the HDL cholesterol reagent obtained from Sigma. Total plasma cholesterol and HDL-C were determined by the CHOD-PAP method (Boehringer Mannheim). To compare several methods for HDL-C quantitation, all initial analyses were performed in duplicate and HDL-C was determined after precipitation of apolipoprotein B containing lipoproteins (VLDL + LDL) with the HDL cholesterol reagent or after HDL separation by high pressure gel filtration size exclusion chromatography (HPGC) (17Weinstock P.H. Bisgaier C.L. Aalto-Setälä K.A. Radner H. Ramakrishnan R. Levak-Frank S. Essenberg A.D. Zechner R. Breslow J.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 2555-2568Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). In a few experiments HDL-C was determined after HDL preparation by preparative ultracentrifugation. All methods gave essentially the same results. Accordingly, HDL-C concentrations determined after precipitation of apolipoprotein B containing lipoproteins were used throughout the study. TG were determined using an enzymatic kit obtained from Sigma. FFA were measured enzymatically using a kit obtained from Wako Chemicals (Neuss, Germany). To prepare the labeled VLDL, control mice were injected intravenously with [3H]palmitate (200 μCi) and bled 45 min after the injection. Plasma samples were ultracentrifuged to obtain the VLDL fraction. TLC on Silica Gel G plates using hexane-diethylether-acetic acid solution (83:16:1) as the solvent was performed to ensure that 85–90% of the label was in the TG fraction before the VLDL preparations were used for further studies. Radiolabeled VLDL clearance was determined in 10 animals of each line. Mice were injected intravenously with 200,000 dpm of 3H-labeled VLDL, and the disappearance of the radiolabeled VLDL was determined from plasma samples drawn 2, 5, 10, 20, 40, 75, and 120 min after the injection. VLDL-TG kinetics were analyzed using a one- or two-pool model based on a main VLDL pool, with the assumption that the remnant pool is derived entirely from the main pool (57Mathews C.H. Phys. Med. Biol. 1957; 2: 36-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). FCR were determined by fitting a one- or two-pool model by minimizing a weighted sum of squares of differences between the observed data and model-generated values (the weighting assumes a constant coefficient of variation or percent error). The procedure is described in detail in Ref. 57Mathews C.H. Phys. Med. Biol. 1957; 2: 36-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar. The program, called POOLFIT, was developed by one of the authors (R. Ramakrishnan) and has been used in a variety of tracer kinetic studies in the past (17Weinstock P.H. Bisgaier C.L. Aalto-Setälä K.A. Radner H. Ramakrishnan R. Levak-Frank S. Essenberg A.D. Zechner R. Breslow J.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 2555-2568Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Animals of each line were given an intragastric bolus of RE in corn oil (3000 units), followed by 100 μl of air. Mice were bled before and 1, 2, 4, and 10 h after vitamin A administration. 100 μl of plasma were placed in a 13 × 100-mm tube containing 500 μl of saline. Subsequently, 40 ng of retinyl acetate (in 200 μl of mobile phase), 500 μl of methanol, and 500 μl of mobile phase were added. The tubes contents were vortexed after each addition. Phase separation was achieved by centrifugation at 350 × g for 15 min. The upper phase was removed and analyzed for retinoids. Retinol and retinyl ester quantification was essentially performed as described previously (21Ruotolo G. Zhang H. Bentsianov V. Le N.-A. J. Lipid Res. 1992; 33: 1541-1549Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The analytes were separated at a flow rate of 2 ml/min on a Exsil 100 column (5 μm, 200 × 4.6 mm), with hexane/butylchloride/acetonitrile (90:7.5:2.5) containing 0.01% (v/v) acetic acid as the mobile phase and fluorimetric detection (Ex = 350 nm, Em = 510 nm). Under these conditions retention times were 1.2, 1.6, and 4.1 min for retinyl palmitate, retinyl acetate, and retinol, respectively. Vitamin A clearance was assessed by comparing peak heights and total areas under the plasma decay curve of retinyl palmitate (RP). Plasma from control mice was incubated with [3H]cholesteryl oleoyl ether (specific activity 46.6 Ci/mmol; Amersham), Intralipid®, and human cholesteryl ester transfer protein for 16 h at 37 °C as described previously (22Hayek T. Chajek-Shaul T. Walsh A. Azrolan N. Breslow J.L. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1991; 11: 1295-1302Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The labeled HDL fraction was isolated by sequential ultracentrifugation between d 1.063 and 1.21 g/ml, dialyzed against five changes of 1 liter of 0.9% NaCl and 1 mm EDTA for 20 h, and used immediately. Mice were injected intravenously with labeled HDL, where the injected mass was less than 5% of the mouse HDL pool. Seventy microliters of blood was taken from the retro-orbital plexus at 10 min, 1.5, 3, 8, and 24 h after injection for determination of plasma radioactivity. The fraction catabolic rates for HDL cholesteryl linoleyl ether were calculated from the plasma decay curves, assuming a two-pool model by the Matthews method (57Mathews C.H. Phys. Med. Biol. 1957; 2: 36-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). HDL particle size distribution was evaluated as described previously (23Blanche P.J. Gong E.L. Forte T.M. Nichols A.V. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1981; 665: 408-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar, 24Verdery R.B. Benham D.F. Baldwin H.L. Goldberg A.P. Nichols A.V. J. Lipid Res. 1989; 30: 1085-1095Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Plasma specimens from each mouse were subjected to gradient gel electrophoresis. In a 175-μl Airfuge tube, 40 μl of plasma was adjusted to d 1.21 g/ml with 1.35 g/ml KBr and 1 mm EDTA and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 5 h (Airfuge). 30 μl were then aspirated from the top of the tube and electrophoresed for 20 min at 70 V and then for 18–24 h at 125 V on nondenaturing 4–30% polyacrylamide gradient gels (PAA 4/30, Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). Gels were simultaneously stained and fixed in 0.05% Coomassie R-250 (Bio-Rad), 9% acetic acid, and 20% methanol, then destained with two changes of 9% acetic acid, 20% methanol followed by 9% acetic acid. Stained gels were scanned using a digital scanning densitometer (model 620, Bio-Rad) equipped with a 600-nm interference filter, and the data were entered into a PC. Scans were analyzed by Gaussian modeling as described previously (24Verdery R.B. Benham D.F. Baldwin H.L. Goldberg A.P. Nichols A.V. J. Lipid Res. 1989; 30: 1085-1095Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Stokes radius of HDL particles was estimated by comparing migration distances with those of thyroglubulin (8.5 nm), apoferritin (6.1 nm), catalase (5.2 nm), lactate dehydrogenase (4.08 nm), and bovine serum albumin (3.55 nm). Results are expressed as means ± S.D. Student's t test was applied to calculate statistical significances of differences among groups. Statistical significance was defined as p < 0.05. To investigate the metabolic consequences of tissue-specific expression of LPL exclusively in muscle, transgenic mouse lines were generated that expressed the enzyme in SM and CM only and not in any other tissue. As shown in Table I, two crosses were necessary to produce littermates that either were controls (L2) or expressed human LPL in muscle on either the normal (L2-MCK) or LPL-null (L0-MCK) backgrounds. All animals had similar growth curves and body mass composition. LPL gene expression was assessed by mRNA and enzyme activity in SM, CM, and AT. To differentiate between mouse and human LPL mRNA, species-specific probes were used as described previously (18Levak-Frank S. Radner H. Walsh A. Stollberger R. Knipping G. Hoefler G. Sattler W. Weinstock P.H. Breslow J.L. Zechner R. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 976-986Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Northern blot analysis (Fig. 2) revealed that mouse LPL mRNA of the expected size (Fig. 2 A, 3.8 kb) was detected in all tissues from L2 and L2-MCK mice, while no signal was observed in any tissue from L0-MCK animals. When a human LPL-specific probe was hybridized, a signal of the expected size (Fig. 2 B, 3.6 kb) was found in both CM and SM of L2-MCK and L0-MCK mice but not in L2 mice, indicating the successful tissue-specific expression of the human transgene in L2-MCK and L0-MCK mice. Fig. 3 compares LPL enzyme activities in tissues of both fed and fasted male animals. Female mice showed similar albeit less pronounced differences and therefore are not shown. Anti-human LPL antibody, which has been shown not to cross-react with mouse LPL (18Levak-Frank S. Radner H. Walsh A. Stollberger R. Knipping G. Hoefler G. Sattler W. Weinstock P.H. Breslow J.L. Zechner R. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 976-986Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar), was used to determine the contribution of transgene-derived LPL in L2-MCK mice and confirmed that LPL activity in L0-MCK mice was exclusively human. In the fed state, LPL activities in SM were increased 6.6-fold in both L2-MCK and L0-MCK mice as compared with L2 mice. During fasting, LPL activities were increased 4.2- and 3.4-fold in L2-MCK and L0-MCK mice, respectively. CM activity was increased 1.4-fold in L2-MCK mice in both fed and fasted state, while decreased 82% and 64%, respectively, in fed and fasted L0-MCK mice. AT LPL activities were elevated 1.8-fold in the fed state and unchanged in the fasted state in L2-MCK mice when compared with controls, while undetectable in L0-MCK mice. PHP LPL activities were measured in the fed and fasted states. As shown in Table II, fasted PHP LPL activities were increased 2.3-fold in L2-MCK mice and 1.3-fold in L0-MCK mice when compared with L2"
https://openalex.org/W2095066587,"The signal transduction pathway from heterotrimeric G proteins to the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade is best understood in the yeast mating pheromone response, in which a serine/threonine protein kinase (STE20) serves as the critical linking component.

Many neurotransmitters, hormones, chemokines, and sensory stimuli initiate physiological effects through their membrane-bound seven-helix transmembrane receptors that are coupled to heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding regulatory proteins (G proteins) (1Gilman A.

G proteins transduce signals like an on and off switch. Liganded receptors activate G proteins by catalyzing the exchange of GDP bound to the α subunit (the inactive state) with GTP (the active state), resulting in dissociation of α-GTP from the βγ subunits. Both α and βγ subunits can trigger downstream events (4Clapham D.E. Neer E.J. Nature. 1993; 365: 403-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar). Several major intracellular signaling pathways have been shown to be regulated by G protein-coupled receptors. These pathways include the cAMP/protein kinase A pathway, the phosphatidylinositol/calcium/protein kinase C pathway and the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) 1The abbreviations used are: MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; MBP, myelin basic protein; mAChR, muscarinic acetylcholine receptor; PH, pleckstrin-homology; BCR, B-cell receptor. 1The abbreviations used are: MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; MBP, myelin basic protein; mAChR, muscarinic acetylcholine receptor; PH, pleckstrin-homology; BCR, B-cell receptor.pathway (1Gilman A.

The coupling mechanisms of G proteins to the cAMP and phosphatidylinositol pathways have been defined (1Gilman A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 615-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (4682) Google Scholar). Gsand Gi proteins directly modulate the activity of adenylyl cyclases, thus the cellular level of the second messenger cAMP. Gq and Gi proteins directly activate phospholipase Cβ, thus increasing phosphatidylinositol turnover. However, the mechanism by which G protein-coupled receptors activate the MAPK pathway is less clearly defined in vertebrates and is an area of intense research.The MAPK pathway is found ubiquitously in eukaryotic organisms and is used for regulating cell proliferation, differentiation, and many other diverse biological functions (7Schlessinger J.

Following ligand binding and receptor autophosphorylation, the complex of the adapter protein Grb2 and the guanine nucleotide exchange factor Sos, or the Shc (another adapter protein)·Grb2·Sos complex, is recruited to tyrosine-phosphorylated receptors. This leads to the prototype Ras/Raf/MEK/MAPK pathway (7Schlessinger J. Ullrich A. Neuron. 1992; 9: 383-391Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1287) Google Scholar, 8Blenis J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae mating pheromone response, upon pheromone receptor activation, an inactive heterotrimeric G protein dissociates, freeing the βγ subunits from an inhibitory α subunit. βγ is then able to activate the MAPK cascade through a scaffold protein (STE5), a serine/threonine protein kinase (STE20), and possibly other proteins (11Herskowitz I. Cell. 1995; 80: 187-197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (863) Google Scholar). Our understanding of the route leading from G protein-mediated signals to the MAPK activation in vertebrate cells is much less complete.

Kurosaki T. Huang X.-Y. Nature. 1996; 380: 541-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). We have chosen an avian lymphoma cell line DT40 as our model system due to the high efficiency of homologous recombination in these cells (37Buerstedde J.-M. Takeda S. Cell. 1991; 67: 179-188Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). Thus it is feasible for genetic manipulation in both generating loss-of-function mutants of relevant molecules by site-specific targeted deletion and in performing gain-of-function assay by overexpressing. Using tyrosine kinases Lyn and Syk knock-out cells, we have shown previously that the Gq-MAPK signaling requires Lyn and Syk, while the Gi-MAPK signaling needs Syk (30Wan Y. Kurosaki T. Huang X.-Y. Nature. 1996; 380: 541-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Here with tyrosine kinases Csk and Btk knock-out cells, we demonstrate that while Csk is required for Gq-MAPK pathway, Btk is essential for Gi-MAPK signaling. Furthermore, with epistatic genetic and biochemical analysis in these tyrosine kinase-deficient cells, we have determined the order of action of these tyrosine kinases in the pathways. A surprising positive function for Csk, an otherwise negative regulator of Src-family tyrosine kinases, has been observed. Syk serves as a converging point and plays a central role in both Gq- and Gi-coupled signaling pathways. This point has been further strengthened by direct protein-protein binding analysis showing that Syk binds purified Lyn, Csk, or Btk. Therefore, these tyrosine kinases form a cascade that couples G proteins to the MAPK cascade in these avian lymphoma cells.DISCUSSIONOur molecular genetic and biochemical analysis of the vertebrate G protein-MAPK pathway places Syk kinase at a critical converging point (Fig. 6 A). Gq-coupled receptors through Csk and Lyn, and Gi-coupled receptors through Btk, activate Syk. Syk, in turn, feeds the signal into the MAPK cascade (Fig. 6 A). Although we have drawn the genetic pathway from G protein to MAPK in DT40 cells as a linear pathway, it should be stressed that the relationship among tyrosine kinases could be much more complicated as exemplified by the feedback regulation of Btk by Syk in the Gi-MAPK pathway.The role of Btk and Csk in G protein-coupled receptor signaling is different from their roles in B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling. In Btk− cells, although BCR-induced inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate generation and intracellular calcium mobilization were completely abolished, stimulation of MAPK by BCR was not affected (44Takata M. Kurosaki T. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 184: 31-40Crossref Scopus (424) Google Scholar). Moreover, the overall pattern of tyrosine phosphorylation of cellular proteins elicited by BCR was not different between Btk− and wild-type DT40 cells (44Takata M. Kurosaki T. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 184: 31-40Crossref Scopus (424) Google Scholar). In Csk−cells, no defects in BCR signaling were observed, other than a small increase in basal Lyn and Syk kinase activity (43Hata A. Sabe H. Kurosaki T. Takata M. Hanafusa H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7306-7313Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). These data suggest that these tyrosine kinases play different roles and participate in different pathways in BCR and G protein-coupled receptor signaling.Positive Role for Csk in G Protein SignalingOur surprising finding that Csk plays a positive role in the activation of MAPK by Gq signal and in Syk activation in DT40 cells is very intriguing. Csk was originally purified as a kinase that phosphorylates the COOH-terminal tyrosine residues of Src-family tyrosine kinases, including Lyn, thereby negatively regulating their activity (47Nada S. Okada M. MacAuley A. Cooper J.A. Nakagawa H. Nature. 1991; 351: 69-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar). Overexpression of Csk decreased T-cell receptor-induced lymphokine production and protein tyrosine phosphorylation in T lymphocytes, although the in vivo function of Csk in T-cell receptor signaling is still not clear (49Chow L.M. Fournel M. Davidson D. Veillette A. Nature. 1993; 365: 156-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar, 50Cloutier J.-F. Chow L.M. Veillette A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5937-5944Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Mice deficient in Csk have increased activity of Src-family kinases and exhibit impaired formation of neural tube and embryonic lethality (51Imamoto A. Soriano P. Cell. 1993; 73: 1117-1124Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar, 52Nada S. Yagi T. Takeda H. Tokunaga T. Nakagawa H. Ikawa Y. Okada M. Aizawa S. Cell. 1993; 73: 1125-1135Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). However, although Src-family kinases were activated, tumorigenesis was not observed in any tissues. Our data show that Csk is positively required for the Gq-MAPK pathway and that overexpressing Csk leads to increased, rather than decreased, Syk kinase activity. Furthermore, overexpressing Csk did not block the stimulation of MAPK by m1 or m2 mAChRs in wild-type DT40 cells. 3Y. Wan and X.-Y. Huang, unpublished data. There are several recent reports suggesting that Csk has functions other than suppressing Src-family kinases. Overexpressing Csk in HeLa cells did not significantly suppress Src activity, but still led to dramatic changes in HeLa cell morphology (53Bergman M. Joukov V. Virtanen I. Alitalo K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 711-722Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Csk is required for normal development of lymphoid cells. Csk deficiency blocks T- and B-cell differentiation as is the case with Src-family kinase deficiency. Thus Csk could act on targets other than Src-related kinases (48Gross J.A. Appleby M.W. Chien S. Nada S. Bartelmez S.H. Okada M. Aizawa S. Perlmutter R.M. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 463-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). It has also been shown that Csk could phosphorylate and activate the cell-surface receptor protein-tyrosine phosphatase (54Autero M. Saharinen J. Pessa-Morikawa T. Soula-Rothbut M. Oetken C. Gassmann M. Bergman M. Alitalo K. Burn P. Gahmberg C.G. Mustelin T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1308-1321Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Therefore, Csk could perform dual positive and negative functions and work on Src-family kinases as well as other targets.Could Syk Serve as a Scaffold Protein as Well as a Kinase?In this report, we have presented data that demonstrate the central role of Syk in both Gq and Gi signaling pathways to MAPK. Overexpression of Lyn, Csk, or Btk leads to stimulation of Syk kinase activity. Purified Lyn, Csk, and Btk directly bind to Syk. Coimmunoprecipitation studies have indicated that additional cellular proteins can interact with Syk, including protein kinase Cμ (55Sidorenko S.P. Law C.-L. Chandran K.A. Clark E.A. Proc. Natl.

Chem. 1995; 270: 6824-6829Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), as well as the B-cell receptor, the T-cell receptor, and the high-affinity receptor for immunoglobulin E (46Satterthwaite A. Witte O. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 131-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 59Bolen J.B. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1995; 7: 306-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). It would appear from these various reports that the composition of Syk-containing signaling complexes is dictated by the nature of the activated receptor and the other signaling molecules involved. It is possible that tyrosine phosphorylation of Syk, like tyrosine kinase FAK, can create specific binding sites for SH2 domain-containing proteins, thereby promoting the formation of intracellular multimeric signaling complexes (60Schlaepfer D.D. Hanks S.K. Hunter T. van der Geer P. Nature. 1994; 372: 786-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (1438) Google Scholar). Thus, Syk could function as a scaffold or adapter protein as well as serve as a kinase. Recently it has been shown that Syk-deficient mice exhibited perinatal lethality (61Turner M. Mee P.J. Costello P.S. Williams O. Price A.A. Duddy L.P. Furlong M.T. Geahlen R.L. Tybulewicz V.L.J.

Nature. 1995; 378: 303-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that Syk has multiple functions in the mouse such as in maintaining vascular integrity, in wound healing, and in B-cell development (61Turner M. Mee P.J. Costello P.S. Williams O. Price A.A. Duddy L.P. Furlong M.T. Geahlen R.L. Tybulewicz V.L.J. Nature. 1995; 378: 298-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar, 62Cheng A.M. Rowlwy B. Pao W. Hayday A. Bolen J.B. Pawson T. Nature. 1995; 378: 303-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar).Role of Nonreceptor Tyrosine Kinases in Heterotrimeric G Protein SignalingOur data demonstrate an essential role for nonreceptor tyrosine kinases in heterotrimeric G protein signaling. Although studies on tyrosine kinases have been very intense over the past decade, regulation of nonreceptor tyrosine kinases by heterotrimeric G proteins has not been studied until recently. Given the broad usage of both the heterotrimeric G protein signaling system and nonreceptor tyrosine kinases in cellular functions, it is very desirable to further our understanding how these two common signaling components communicate to each other. It is not surprising that tyrosine kinases play critical roles in many physiological responses mediated by G protein-coupled receptors. For example, smooth muscle contraction induced by mAChRs, angiotensin II, and vasopressin receptors is blocked by various tyrosine kinase inhibitors (for review, see Ref. 63Hollenberg M.D. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1994; 15: 108-114Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). G protein-coupled angiotensin II receptor has been shown to stimulate tyrosine kinases Jak2 and Tyk2 in rat aortic smooth muscle cells leading to the activation of Jak/STAT pathway (64Marrero M.B. Schieffer B. Paxton W.G. Heerdt L. Berk B.C. Delafontaine P. Bernsyein K.E. Nature. 1995; 375: 247-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar). A variety of G-protein-coupled receptors can stimulate the activity of tyrosine kinase FAK (65Zachary I. Rozengurt E. Cell. 1992; 71: 891-894Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). Other documented G protein-coupled receptor-induced events that involve tyrosine kinases include chemotaxis through chemokine receptors, neuronal growth cone collapse by lysophosphatidic acid, cardiovascular hypertrophy/hyperplasia in hypertension, thrombin-induced platelet aggregation, focal adhesion assembly, and stress fiber formation (66Asahi M. Yanagi S. Ohta S. Inazu T. Sakai K. Takeuchi F. Taniguchi T. Yamamura H. FEBS Lett. 1992; 309: 10-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 67Sadoshima J. Qiu Z. Morgan J.P. Izumo S. Circ. Res. 1995; 76: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar, 68Moolenaar W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12949-12952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar).Although the mechanism by which G proteins regulate the activity of adenylyl cyclases and phospholipase C-β is well understood, how G proteins activate tyrosine kinases remains unknown. The activation could be direct and indirect. Clearly, elucidation of detailed activation mechanisms of these tyrosine kinases by G proteins requires further biochemical studies. Regardless of the mechanism, Gq- and Gi-mediated activations and interplays among the tyrosine kinases must be different, since both Gqand Gi can stimulate all four tyrosine kinases, but their pathways to MAPK are different. For example, both Gq- and Gi-coupled receptors are able to stimulate Csk and Btk, but the requirement of Csk and Btk for the Gq- and Gi-MAPK pathways is different. We do not have a satisfactory answer for how the specificity is achieved, as in the cases of other complicated signal transduction pathways. Full activation of many tyrosine kinases requires phosphorylation of tyrosine residues (either through autophosphorylation or by another tyrosine kinase) (69Hunter T. Cell. 1995; 80: 225-236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2577) Google Scholar). It is likely that the tyrosine phosphorylation event could serve as the activation mechanism. In the case of the first tyrosine kinase in a tyrosine kinase cascade, other activation mechanism(s) must exist. Since receptor tyrosine kinases and possibly Raf kinase can be activated by oligomerization (70Leevers S.J. Paterson H.F. Marshall C.J. Nature. 1994; 369: 411-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (877) Google Scholar, 71Stokoe D. Macdonald S.G. Cadwallader K. Symons M. Hancock J.F. Science. 1994; 264: 1463-1467Crossref PubMed Scopus (836) Google Scholar), it is possible that G proteins translocate tyrosine kinase to the membrane to increase the local concentration leading to the activation of tyrosine kinase. This notion is consistent with our results, indicating that membrane localization of Csk is critical for its function in G protein signaling. It is also possible that removal of the inhibitory mechanism (either an inhibitory factor or a unfavorable conformation) can trigger the activation of these kinases. Unraveling the molecular details of the G protein-tyrosine kinase connection is one of the major challenges for future studies.Tyrosine Kinase-dependent Activation of the MAPK Pathway by G Protein-coupled ReceptorsSeveral very recent publications have provided strong evidence that, at least in some vertebrate cell types, activation of the MAPK pathway by G protein-coupled receptors is tyrosine kinase-dependent (30Wan Y. Kurosaki T. Huang X.-Y. Nature. 1996; 380: 541-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 31Sadoshima J.-i. Izumo S.

Nature. 1996; 383: 547-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (876) Google Scholar). The identity of the involved tyrosine kinases is beginning to be defined. We have used a genetic approach to reveal the roles of tyrosine kinases Lyn, Csk, Btk, and Syk in G protein-MAPK pathways in avian lymphoma cells. A dominant-negative mutant of another tyrosine kinase Pyk2 has been shown to interfere the signaling from Gq-coupled bradykinin receptor and Gi-coupled lysophosphatidic acid receptor to MAPK in PC12 cells (Ref. 34Dikic I. Tokiwa G. Lev S. Courtneidge S.A. Schlessinger J. Nature. 1996; 383: 547-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (876) Google Scholar; but not in rat liver epithelial cell lines (72Yu H. Li X. Marchetto G.S. Dy R.

Src-family tyrosine kinases Fyn and Src have also recently been implicated in G protein-MAPK pathways in cardiac myocytes, smooth muscle, and COS cells (31Sadoshima J.-i. Izumo S. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 775-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 32Schieffer B. Paxton W.G. Chai Q. Marrero M.B. Bernstein K.E. J. Biol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 19443-19450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). In avian lymphoma cells, we found multiple tyrosine kinases involved in G protein-MAPK pathways. In PC12 cells, Pyk2 is proposed to work together with Src to link G protein-coupled receptors to MAPK (34Dikic I. Tokiwa G. Lev S. Courtneidge S.A. Schlessinger J. Nature. 1996; 383: 547-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (876) Google Scholar). The epidermal growth factor receptor, a receptor tyrosine kinase, has been implicated in transducing signals from G protein-coupled receptors to the MAPK cascade in Rat-1 cells (73Daub H. Weiss F.U. Wallasch C. Ullrich A. Nature. 1996; 379: 557-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (1314) Google Scholar). Another receptor tyrosine kinase, the platelet-derived growth factor receptor, has also been indicated to be involved in angiotensin II receptor-mediated mitogenic signaling in vascular smooth muscle cells (74Linseman D.A. Benjamin C.W. Jones D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12563-12568Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Therefore, different tyrosine kinases mediate the G protein signals in a general or cell type-specific way. However, the usage of tyrosine kinases in the G protein-MAPK pathway in some cells does not rule out a role for other tyrosine kinase-independent pathways in other cells. In fact, there is some evidence that in certain cells activation of the MAPK cascade by certain G protein-coupled receptors was not sensitive to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (21Winitz S. Russell M.

Previous studies suggested that the negative control exerted by the PTS on bacterial antiterminators of the SacY family involves phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent phosphorylation by the sugar-specific PTS-permeases. However, data reported herein show direct phosphorylation of SacY by HPr(His∼P) with no requirement for SacX. Experiments were carried out to determine the phosphorylatable residues in SacY.

Single or multiple substitutions of these histidyl residues were introduced in SacY by site-directed mutagenesis, and their effects on phosphorylation and antitermination activity were examined. In vitro phosphorylation experiments showed that SacY was phosphorylated on three of the conserved histidines. Nevertheless, in vivo studies using cells bearing asacB′-lacZ reporter fusion, as well as SacY mutants lacking the phosphorylatable histidyls, revealed that only His-99 is directly involved in regulation of SacY antitermination activity.

Transcription initiates constitutively from the sacB promoter, but in the absence of sucrose, most transcripts terminate at a rho-independent transcriptional terminator located in the leader region preceeding thesacB structural gene. In the presence of sucrose, SacY is activated and stabilizes a stem-loop structure of a ribonucleic acid antiterminator, thereby preventing alternative formation of the overlapping transcriptional terminator (5Aymerich S.

SacY activity is negatively controlled by enzyme I (EI) 1The abbreviations used are: EI, enzyme I; PTS, phosphoenolpyruvate:sugar phosphotransferase system; PEP, phosphoenolpyruvate; GST, glutathione S-transferase; IPTG, isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. and HPr, the general energy coupling proteins of the phosphoenolpyruvate:sugar phosphotransferase system (PTS), and by SacX, a protein homologous to sucrose-specific PTS permeases (6Zukowski M.M.

Energy for these coupled reactions is provided by phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP).

The modular carbohydrate-specific permeases are generally comprised of three proteins or domains, EIIA, EIIB, and EIIC (8Saier Jr., M.H. Reizer J. J.

The EIIC protein or domain is the integral membrane permease, whereas EIIA and EIIB are hydrophilic, peripherally membrane-associated proteins or domains that are phosphorylated during the phosphoryl transfer cascade. EIIB∼P transfers its phosphate to the incoming sugar during its translocation across the membrane (for reviews, see Refs. 9Postma P.W. Lengeler J.W. Jacobson G.R. Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 57: 543-594Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and 10Saier Jr., M.H. Reizer J. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 13: 755-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). SacX is thought to be an EIIBC protein; the corresponding EIIA protein has not been characterized to date. Our long term interest in the multifaceted controls exerted by the PTS led us to investigate the molecular mechanism involved in PTS-mediated regulation of transcriptional antitermination by SacY. Previous genetic data (7Crutz A.-M. Steinmetz M. Aymerich S. Richter R. Le Coq D. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 1043-1050Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and comparison with results reported for the homologous BglG antiterminator of Escherichia coli (11Amster-Choder O. Houman F. Wright A. Cell. 1989; 58: 847-855Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 12Amster-Choder O. Wright A. Science. 1990; 249: 540-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 13Schnetz K. Rak B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5074-5078Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) suggested that this control involves a cascade of phosphorylations. The E. coli bgl operon, required for transport and hydrolysis of β-glucosides, is inducible by β-glucosides through a BglG-dependent antitermination mechanism (14Mahadevan S. Wright A. Cell. 1987; 50: 485-494Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 15Schnetz K. Rak B. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 3271-3277Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Activity of BglG is negatively controlled by BglF, a β-glucoside permease with EIIBCA domain structure, that has been reported to phosphorylate BglG at an unknown residue in response to the external level of inducer (11Amster-Choder O. Houman F. Wright A. Cell. 1989; 58: 847-855Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 12Amster-Choder O. Wright A. Science. 1990; 249: 540-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 13Schnetz K. Rak B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Furthermore, phosphorylation of BglG has been shown to prevent its dimerization. Consequently the PTS was proposed to control the antitermination activity of BglG by modulating the level of its active, unphosphorylated, dimeric form (16Amster-Choder O. Wright A. Science. 1992; 257: 1395-1398Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Two other antiterminators in B. subtilis, in addition to SacY, belong to the BglG family: SacT mediates induction of thesacPA operon by sucrose (17Debarbouille M. Arnaud M. Fouet A. Klier A. Rapoport G. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 3966-3973Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and LicT mediates induction of the licTS and bglPH operons by β-glucosides (18Le Coq D. Lindner C. Krüger S. Steinmetz M. Stülke J. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 1527-1535Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Schnetz K. Stülke J. Gertz S. Krüger S. Krieg M. Hecker M. Rak B. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 1971-1979Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, SacT and LicT are not active in mutants lacking EI (ptsI) or HPr (ptsH) (20Arnaud M. Vary P. Zagorec M. Klier A. Débarbouillé M. Postma P. Rapoport G. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 3161-3170Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Krüger S. Hecker M. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 5590-5597Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Krüger S. Gertz S. Hecker M. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 2637-2644Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, PTS-mediated phosphorylation appears to exert positive control over SacT and LicT antitermination activities. Positive control by the PTS has been also demonstrated for LevR, a B. subtilisDNA-binding transcriptional regulator involved in fructose-promoted induction of the levanase operon (23Débarbouillé M. Martin-Verstraete I. Klier A. Rapoport G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2212-2216Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 24Stülke J. Martin-Verstraete I. Charrier V. Klier A. Deutscher J. Rapoport G. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 6928-6936Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recent experiments have shown that SacT and LevR are phosphorylated by PEP in a PTS-catalyzed reaction that depends only on EI and HPr. These observations suggested that phosphorylation is involved in PTS-mediated positive control of these transcriptional regulators (4Arnaud M. Débarbouillé M. Rapoport G. Saier Jr., M.H. Reizer J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18966-18972Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 24Stülke J. Martin-Verstraete I. Charrier V. Klier A. Deutscher J. Rapoport G. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 6928-6936Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We note however that despite the sequence conservation between the antiterminators of the BglG family, SacY is not subject to PTS-mediated positive control sincesacB is constitutively expressed in a ptsHImutant (7Crutz A.-M. Steinmetz M. Aymerich S. Richter R. Le Coq D. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 1043-1050Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This fact renders SacY a good model protein for analysis of PTS-mediated negative control of antitermination. In this manuscript, we show that SacY is readily phosphorylated by PEP in a PTS-catalyzed reaction that depends only on EI and HPr. Additionally, computer-aided analyses led us to identify histidyl residues that are highly conserved in the modular SacY and in 13 distinct RNA- and DNA-binding proteins that bear duplicated SacY-like domains. Utilizing site-directed mutants of these conserved histidyl residues, we provide evidence demonstrating that His-99, His-207 and His-269 of SacY are phosphorylated by HPr(His∼P). Finally, we present data suggesting that PTS-dependent inactivation of SacY activity is mainly due to phosphorylation of His-99. Altogether, the data presented define the role of PTS-catalyzed phosphorylation of SacY in the modulation of its transcriptional antitermination activity. Since SacY-like domains as well as phosphorylatable histidyl residues are highly conserved in 14 distinct mRNA-binding and DNA-binding proteins, the reported data provide guidelines for studies of PTS-dependent transcriptional regulation by a unique family of functionally distinct regulatory proteins. A fragment carrying the entire sacY sequence, flanked with BamHI andEcoRI restriction sites, was generated by PCR with the DYB (5′-CGCGGATCCATGAAAATTAA-AAGAATCTTAAATC-3′) and FYE (5′-CCGGAATTCAGCGTGCGACTGACCGTTGG-3′) primers on pSL90 (7Crutz A.-M. Steinmetz M. Aymerich S. Richter R. Le Coq D. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 1043-1050Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Following digestion with BamHI and EcoRI, the 847-base pair fragment was cloned into pBluescript SK− (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) generating pIC437. The CAT (His) codon at position 99, 158, 207, or 269 was substituted with a TAT (Tyr) codon by site-directed mutagenesis using the Muta-gene M13 in vitro mutagenesis kit (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). sacY alleles carrying two or three of these His to Tyr mutations were constructed by successive site-directed mutageneses or, when possible, by exchange of a relevant restriction fragment. The wild-type and mutated sacY genes were then cloned into the B. subtilis pSL90 integrative plasmid (7Crutz A.-M. Steinmetz M. Aymerich S. Richter R. Le Coq D. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 1043-1050Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), generating a collection of plasmids that were used to integrate the different alleles at the sacY locus. For this, the BstBI/AccI fragment of pSL90, carrying the 3′ part of sacY, was replaced with theBstBI/EcoRV fragment of pIC437 or one of its derivatives carrying a sacY mutant allele. The BamHI/EcoRI fragment from pIC437 or its derivatives was inserted into pGEX-2T (Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden) to give a plasmid overproducing the wild-type or a mutant glutathioneS-transferase (GST)-SacY fusion protein. pGEX-2T derivatives overproducing the wild-type or the mutated P1 and P2 domains of SacY were constructed as follows. DNA fragments carrying the wild-type or the mutated sequences encoding the P1 and P2 domains flanked withBamHI and EcoRI restriction sites, were generated by PCR using pIC437 or its derivatives with the primers DYP1B (5′-CGCGGATCCACATTGCCTG-AAGACCAC-3′) and FYP1E (5′-CCGGAATTCAGGCATTGTTTCTTGCTGTG-3′) (for the P1 domain encoding sequence) or DYP2B (5′-CGCGGATCCGGCGATATGACACAAAC-3′) and FYE (for the P2 domain encoding sequence). These fragments were then digested withBamHI and EcoRI, and cloned into pGEX-2T. The entire sacY gene as well as the P1 and P2 encoding sequences in the different plasmids were verified by sequencing after site-directed mutagenesis or PCR. Plasmid pIC424, which carries the B. subtilis pts operon with a ptsI::spe disruption, was derived from pTS20 (25Gonzy-Tréboul G. Steinmetz M. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 2287-2290Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) by insertion of a spectinomycin resistance gene,i.e. a SmaI fragment from pIC156 (26Steinmetz M. Richter R. Gene. 1994; 142: 79-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), into theSstI site of ptsI. pSL151 is a B. subtilis replicative plasmid, carrying the pUB110 replication origin, the chloramphenicol resistance cat gene, and thesacX gene under the control of the spac promoter (27Yansura D.G. Henner D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 439-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). E. coli strains used for plasmid construction, mutagenesis and protein overproduction were DH5α, CJ236, and BL21(DE3,) respectively (28Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). B. subtilis GM152 (trpC2 sacB′-lacZ sacXYΔ3) was described previously (7Crutz A.-M. Steinmetz M. Aymerich S. Richter R. Le Coq D. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 1043-1050Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The B. subtilis strain GM1288 (sacXYΔ3 sacBΔ23 sacTΔ4 amyE::bglP′-lacZ Δ(licS-bglP)::aphA3) is deleted of all known antiterminator genes and derived from GM1271 (18Le Coq D. Lindner C. Krüger S. Steinmetz M. Stülke J. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 1527-1535Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).B. subtilis GM1320 and GM1386 were derived from GM1288 by an in-frame deletion of the DraI/HpaI fragment ofptsH (deletion of codons 6–34) and by introduction of theptsI::spe disruption present in plasmid pIC424, respectively. The B. subtilis strains GM1288X, GM1320X, and GM1386X were obtained by transformation of GM1288, GM1320, and GM1386, respectively, with pSL151. LB medium (29Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972Google Scholar) supplemented with appropriate antibiotics (chloramphenicol (4 μg/ml) or spectinomycin (100 μg/ml) forB. subtilis, and ampicillin (50 μg/ml) for E. coli) was routinely used for selection of transformants. BL21(DE3) transformants were grown at 30 °C in 2 × YT medium (28Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) supplemented with 50 μg/ml ampicillin. B. subtilis extracts for phosphorylation assays were prepared as follows. Cells were grown in liquid LB medium supplemented with sucrose (30 mm) and isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) (0.5 mm) to allow sacX expression from thespac promoter carried by pSL151. Cells were harvested by centrifugation when the culture reached an A 600of 1.5 and resuspended in a B. subtilis lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mmdithiothreitol). Cells were ruptured by sonication, and extracts were then centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 5 min. Aliquots of the supernatants were stored at −80 °C until used. Enzyme I and HPr were prepared as described previously (30Reizer J. Sutrina S.L. Saier Jr., M.H. Stewart G.C. Peterkofsky A. Reddy P. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 2111-2120Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 31Reizer J. Sutrina S.L. Wu L.-F. Deutscher J. Reddy P. Saier Jr., M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9158-9169Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The wild type and mutant SacY proteins as well as the P1 and P2 domains were produced and purified as GST-fusions. For this purpose, BL21(DE3) was transformed with the pGEX-2T derivatives, and transformants were grown with shaking at 30 °C in 200 ml of 2 × YT liquid medium. Protein overproduction was induced by addition of IPTG (0.5 mm) at an A 600 of 0.5. After an additional 4-h incubation at 30 °C, cells were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in an E. coli lysis buffer (50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 120 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm benzamidine). Cells were lysed by sonication, and membranes were removed by a 30-min centrifugation at 100,000 × g. The supernatant was then applied to a prepacked glutathione-Sepharose 4B column (Pharmacia), and fusion proteins were purified as recommended by the manufacturer. Purity of the proteins was confirmed by electrophoresis on 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels (32Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207472) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford method (33Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217370) Google Scholar). Chemical synthesis of [32P]PEP from [32P]orthophosphate (ICN, Costa Mesa, CA) was performed as described previously (34Alpert C.A. Frank R. Stüber K. Deutscher J. Hengstenberg W. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 959-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The reaction mixture was loaded onto an AG1 × 8 column (Bio-Rad), preequilibrated with 0.1 mammonium bicarbonate, and [32P]PEP was separated from [32P]orthophosphate using 5-ml aliquots of 0.2, 0.4, and 0.7 m ammonium bicarbonate. Fractions of 1 ml were collected, and eluted material was identified by thin layer chromatography on silica plates and tert-amyl alcohol/formate/H2O (3:2:1) as a solvent. Under these conditions, [32P]orthophosphate eluted in fractions 7 and 8 while [32P]PEP eluted in fractions 11–13. Purified SacY (2.8 μg, used as the GST-fusion or separated from GST after cleavage with thrombin) was phosphorylated by incubation at 37 °C in a reaction mixture (15 μl final volume) containing 50 mmpotassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4), 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 2.5 μm (0.25 μCi) [32P]PEP, and either B. subtilis crude extract (17 μg) or the purified PTS proteins EI (3 μg) and HPr (1 or 0.1 μg). The reaction was terminated after 20 min by addition of SDS-electrophoresis sample buffer. This incubation time allowed for maximal protein phosphorylation, as determined by kinetic experiments (up to 60 min). Proteins were separated on 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Autoradiography of dried gels were performed with Kodak x-ray film (X-OMAT) with exposure times ranging between 2 and 24 h at −80 °C. B. subtilis liquid cultures were grown in CgCH medium (7Crutz A.-M. Steinmetz M. Aymerich S. Richter R. Le Coq D. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 1043-1050Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) supplemented with chloramphenicol (4 mg/l), tryptophan (50 mg/l), with or without 60 mm sucrose. Preparation of B. subtilis extracts and β-galactosidase assays were performed as described previously (29Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972Google Scholar, 35Piggot P.J. Curtis C.A.M. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 1260-1266Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Assays were repeated with at least three independent transformants for each construct. The mean value is given for each assay. Standard deviations were not more than 15% for activities equal to or higher than 3.5 Miller units and not more than 40% for lower activities. PTS-catalyzed phosphorylation of SacY was examined using in vitrophosphorylation assays. Purified SacY was incubated in the presence of [32P]PEP and a crude extract prepared from B. subtilis GM1288X. Phosphorylation of the 55-amino acid N-terminal domain of SacY fused to GST was examined under the same conditions. As shown, SacY was readily phosphorylated by PEP (Fig. 1,lane 3), whereas no phosphorylation of the 55-amino acid N-terminal peptide was detected (Fig. 1, lane 2). The involvement of the general PTS enzymes in this phosphorylation was examined by incubating SacY in the presence of a crude extract from GM1320X (ptsH) or GM1386X (ptsI). No phosphorylation could be detected when SacY was incubated in the presence of a GM1386X crude extract (Fig. 1, lane 4). SacY was also not phosphorylated when incubated with a crude extract prepared from GM1320X (Fig. 1, lane 5). Nevertheless, SacY phosphorylation was observed following addition of 0.1 or 1 μg of purified HPr to extracts of the ptsH mutant (Fig. 1,lanes 6 and 7). These results demonstrate that SacY is phosphorylated in a PTS-dependent reaction involving the general energy coupling proteins, EI and HPr.Figure 1SacY is phosphorylated by PEP in a PTS-dependent reaction. Autoradiogram of an SDS-polyacrylamide gel showing the radiolabeled proteins obtained by incubation of 14 μg of a crude extract from GM1288X (lanes 1–3) with [32P]PEP and 4 μg of the 55-amino acid N-terminal domain of SacY fused to the GST (lane 2) or 2.8 μg of the entire SacY protein (lane 3). 2.8 μg of the entire SacY protein was also incubated in the presence of [32P]PEP and 14 μg of crude extract from GM1386X (lane 4) or GM1320X (lanes 5–7) supplemented with 0.1 or 1 μg of purified B. subtilis HPr (lanes 6 and 7, respectively). The arrows indicate the positions of SacY and HPr.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In the following phosphorylation experiments, the B. subtilis crude extract containing all the PTS components was replaced by the purified B. subtilis general energy coupling proteins EI and HPr. In these assays, EI, HPr, and SacY were incubated in all possible combinations in the presence of [32P]PEP. As shown in Fig. 2, SacY was readily phosphorylated in the presence of both EI and HPr, whereas no SacY phosphorylation was detected when at least one of the two general PTS proteins was absent. Interestingly, SacX appeared dispensable although the extent of SacY phosphorylation was somewhat higher in the presence of the crude extract (Fig. 1, lanes 6 and 7) than in the presence of the purified EI and HPr (see Fig. 2). These results show that SacY can serve as phosphoryl acceptor with the general energy-coupling protein, HPr(His∼P) serving as the phosphoryl donor, and that phosphorylation of SacY occurs outside of the first 55 N-terminal amino acids. The phosphate groups of phosphorylated SacY, like that of EI and HPr, were unstable under acidic conditions or during heat treatment (data not shown), suggesting that, as are EI and HPr, SacY is phosphorylated on histidyl residues. Studies described below were carried out to identify the phosphorylatable residues in SacY. In silico analyses of SacY and its homologues were performed to derive guidelines for a biochemically based search of the phosphoryl acceptor residues in these proteins. Recent studies have identified the mRNA-binding domain of SacY as the N-terminal 55 amino acids of the antiterminator (36Manival, X., Yang, Y., Strub, M.-P., Kochoyan, M., Steinmetz, M., and Aymerich, S. (1997) EMBO J., in press.Google Scholar). Homologous N-terminal mRNA-binding domains are also present in six fully sequenced SacY homologues. Sequence analysis of these seven proteins revealed that their C-terminal regions consist of two homologous domains (∼100 residues each), herein designated P1 (the N-terminal domain) and P2 (the C-terminal domain; see Fig. 3). P domains are also present in four partially sequenced putative transcriptional regulatory proteins, one in GlcR ofStaphylococcus carnosus, one in LicT of Bacillus amyloliquefaciens, one in CasR of Klebsiella oxytoca, and two in CelR of Bacillus stearothermophilus. Two P domains are also present in each of three distinct transcriptional initiation regulatory proteins, the helix-turn-helix motif possessing DNA-binding LicR (previously named CelR; see Ref. 37Tobisch S. Glaser P. Krüger S. Hecker M. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 496-506Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), LevR of B. subtilis, and MtlR of B. stearothermophilus (see Fig.3). Altogether, 25 homologous P domains have been identified in 14 modular transcriptional regulators. Significantly, homologous P domains could not be identified in eukaryotes or in bacteria lacking the PTS. Binary comparison scores calculated for all P1 and P2 domains revealed that (i) all P domains are homologous, (ii) the P1 domains are more closely related to themselves than to the P2 domains, and (iii) the antiterminator P2 domains, but not the DNA binding protein P2 domains, are more closely related to themselves than to the P1 domains (data not shown). These findings lead us to propose that intragenic duplication of the gene encoding the ancestral P domain gave rise to the present day mRNA-binding antiterminators bearing two homologous P domains and that the P2 domains of the antiterminators evolved to serve a function distinct from that of the P1 domains. Surprisingly, all six P domains of the DNA-binding proteins (LevR, LicR, and MtlR) exhibit higher similarity with the P1 domains than with the P2 domains of the mRNA-binding antiterminators (data not shown; see below for interpretation). The phylogenetic tree of all 25 sequenced P domains (Fig.4) confirmed the conclusions derived from the binary statistical analysis. Although the branch lengths vary substantially, the tree is largely symmetrical with all P1 domains depicted on the left and most P2 domains (except those of LevR, LicR, and MtlR) depicted on the right. The tree reveals (i) that the antiterminator P1 domains comprise a tighter cluster than the corresponding cluster of the P2 domains, (ii) that the P1 and P2 clusters of the antiterminators exhibit a near mirror image appearance, and (iii) that the P2 domains of the DNA-binding regulators also exhibit a near mirror image appearance, but they are more closely aligned with the antiterminator P1 domains. We propose that the antiterminator P2 domains evolved to assume a function dissimilar from that of the P1 domains while the P2 domains of the DNA-binding proteins did not. When the 25 sequenced P1 and P2 domains were multiply aligned, only three residues in the alignment proved to be conserved in at least 23 positions (Fig. 5). These amino acids, highlighted inblack, are (i) the histidyl residue at alignment position 8 that corresponds, respectively, to His-99 and His-207 in the P1 and P2 domains of SacY (conserved in all 25 P domains), (ii) the arginyl residue at alignment position 15 (conserved in 23 P domains), and (iii) the glutamyl residue at alignment position 63 (conserved in 24 P domains). An additional histidyl residue (alignment position 74 in Fig.5) that corresponds to His-158 and His-269 in the P1 and P2 domains of SacY, respectively, is conserved in all P1 domains and in all but three of the P2 domains (those of BglR, BglG, and LevR). It is noteworthy, however, that a histidyl residue is present in two of these P2 domains close to alignment position 74, i.e. in position 82 of P2BglG and in position 81 of P2LevR (see Fig. 5). Additionally, we suspect that a frameshift error was inadvertently introduced in the C-terminal region of BglR. The “correct” sequence at this region contains histidyl, glutamyl, and arginyl residues that can be aligned with the corresponding conserved C-terminal residues of the P2 domains (data not shown). Altogether, the data provide evidence for a modular organization of the mRNA-binding antiterminators and the DNA-binding transcrip"

Mutant hoxN alleles were expressed inEscherichia coli, and activity of the altered permeases was examined via a recently described physiological assay (Wolfram, L., Friedrich, B., and Eitinger, T. (1995) J. Bacteriol. 177, 1840–1843). Replacement of Cys-37, Cys-256, or Cys-318 by alanine did not severely affect nickel ion uptake. This activity of a C331A mutant was diminished by 60%, and a similar phenotype was obtained with a cysteine-less mutant harboring four Cys to Ala exchanges. Alterations in a histidine-containing sequence motif (His-62, Asp-67, His-68), which is conserved in microbial nickel transport proteins, strongly affected or completely abolished transport activity in the E. coli system. The analysis of HoxN alkaline phosphatase fusion proteins implied that His-62, Asp-67, and His-68 exchanges did not interfere with overall membrane topology or stability of the nickel permease. These mutations were reintroduced into the A. eutrophus wild-type strain. Analyses of the resulting HoxN mutants indicated that exchanges in the histidine motif led to a clearly decreased affinity of the permease for nickel ion.

Alcaligenes eutrophus H16, a member of the β division of the proteobacteria, can utilize various organic compounds or molecular hydrogen as energy sources. Hydrogen oxidation is catalyzed by two metalloenzymes: a cytoplasmic NAD+-reducing hydrogenase and a membrane-bound, electron transport-coupled hydrogenase. Both enzymes belong to the family of [NiFe] hydrogenases (reviewed in Ref. 1Friedrich B. Schwartz E. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1993; 47: 351-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). A nickel-dependent urease allows the organism to grow on urea as a nitrogen source. Uptake of nickel ion in sufficient amounts is a prerequisite for the synthesis of nickel-containing enzymes. Microbial nickel uptake is mediated by nonspecific transport systems for divalent cations and by specific systems with a high affinity for Ni2+. In natural environments the concentration of Ni2+ is generally very low compared with other divalent cations like Mg2+. Since nonspecific nickel transport is competitively inhibited by a number of divalent cations, this mode of uptake is not suited for meeting the cellular nickel requirements (reviewed in Refs. 2Hausinger R.P. Biochemistry of Nickel. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1993: 181-202Crossref Google Scholar and 3Eitinger T. Friedrich B. Winkelmann G. Carrano C. Transition Metals in Microbial Metabolism. Harwood Academic Publishers, London1997: 235-256Google Scholar). Molecular analyses of Ni2+-specific transport systems of a few bacteria containing [NiFe] hydrogenases and/or ureases showed that two different types of membrane transporters are responsible for high affinity uptake of the transition metal (reviewed in Ref. 3Eitinger T. Friedrich B. Winkelmann G. Carrano C. Transition Metals in Microbial Metabolism. Harwood Academic Publishers, London1997: 235-256Google Scholar). The best studied Ni2+ transporters, the Nik system ofEscherichia coli (4Navarro C. Wu L.F. Mandrand-Berthelot M.-A. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 9: 1181-1191Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar) and the HoxN permease of A. eutrophus (5Eitinger T. Friedrich B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3222-3227Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Eitinger T. Friedrich B. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 12: 1025-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), are the prototype of these two classes. Nik belongs to the ATP binding cassette family of transporters. It consists of five subunits: a periplasmic binding protein (NikA), two integral membrane subunits (NikB, NikC), and two components containing ATP binding motifs (NikD, NikE). There is no evidence that HoxN requires additional proteins for its function as a permease. This suggests that the two types of transporters employ different uptake mechanisms. HoxN is an integral membrane protein and was until recently thought to contain seven transmembrane segments (6Eitinger T. Friedrich B. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 12: 1025-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 7Wolfram L. Friedrich B. Eitinger T. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 1840-1843Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The topological model was based on the construction and analysis of a number of fusions to alkaline phosphatase and β-galactosidase (6Eitinger T. Friedrich B. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 12: 1025-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Due to an error in the originally published hoxN nucleotide sequence (5Eitinger T. Friedrich B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3222-3227Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the C-terminal part of the protein was neglected in the topological study. Additional fusions favor the eight-helix model presented in Fig.1. HoxN homologs have been found in Bradyrhizobium japonicum(8Fu C. Javedan S. Moshiri F. Maier R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5099-5103Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), a hydrogenase-producing soil bacterium; in the thermophilicBacillus strain TB-90 (9Maeda M. Hidaka M. Nakamura H. Masaki H. Uozumi T. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 432-442Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which contains a urease; and inHelicobacter pylori (10Mobley H.L.T. Garner R.M. Bauerfeind P. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 16: 97-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), a human pathogen that is dependent on a highly active urease for initial colonization of the gastric mucosa. It is still not known how these transporters discriminate among divalent cations. Biochemical analyses of the HoxN-type permeases are difficult because these systems have a high affinity for Ni2+ (K T of 10–20 nm) but a very low capacity (reviewed in Ref. 3Eitinger T. Friedrich B. Winkelmann G. Carrano C. Transition Metals in Microbial Metabolism. Harwood Academic Publishers, London1997: 235-256Google Scholar). Therefore, we developed a physiological assay for HoxN-mediated Ni2+ uptake (7Wolfram L. Friedrich B. Eitinger T. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 1840-1843Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to carry out a detailed analysis of the structure-function relationship. In the present report we describe the consequences of amino acid replacements in HoxN. We chose the cysteine residues because of their hypothetical role in metal binding. The main focus of this study, however, is on a conserved histidine motif (His-Xaa4-Asp-His) found in HoxN-type permeases as well as in NikC, an integral membrane component of the E. colinickel transport system (7Wolfram L. Friedrich B. Eitinger T. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 1840-1843Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).

Zinsser Aquasafe 300 Plus was used as the mixture for liquid scintillation analyses in a Packard 1600 TR counter. Biochemicals were obtained from Boehringer Mannheim, New England Biolabs, Amersham, and Life Technologies. PhoA hybrid proteins were detected in Western immunoblots using a rabbit anti-PhoA antibody (5 Prime → 3 Prime, Inc., Boulder, CO) and an alkaline phosphatase-coupled goat anti-rabbit antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch). Nitrocellulose blotting membranes were from Schleicher & Schüll. For direct sequencing of PCR-amplified DNA, samples were purified on Qiagen spin columns. E. coli CC118 (11Manoil C. Beckwith J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 8129-8132Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar) was used as the host for recombinant plasmids. Plasmids pCH231-Sm harboring the A. eutrophus gene hoxN, pCH231-P47, which contains an insertion of the transposon TnphoA in the 48th codon of hoxN, and pCH231-P291 encoding a fusion ofE. coli alkaline phosphatase (PhoA) to HoxN residue 291 were described recently (6Eitinger T. Friedrich B. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 12: 1025-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 7Wolfram L. Friedrich B. Eitinger T. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 1840-1843Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Plasmid pKAU17 (12Mulrooney S.B. Pankratz H.S. Hausinger R.P. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1989; 135: 1769-1776PubMed Google Scholar) containing the urease operon of Klebsiella aerogenes was a gift from R. P. Hausinger (Michigan State University, East Lansing). hoxNmutations were transferred to A. eutrophus H16 (DSM 428, ATCC 17699) by conjugation using the donor E. coli S17–1 (13Simon R. Priefer U. Pühler A. Bio/Technology. 1983; 1: 784-791Crossref Scopus (5629) Google Scholar) and the counterselectable suicide vector pLO2 as described by Lenzet al. (14Lenz O. Schwartz E. Dernedde J. Eitinger M. Friedrich B. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 4385-4393Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mutagenesis was carried out by the PCR-based method of Chen and Przybyla (15Chen B. Przybyla A.E. BioTechniques. 1994; 17: 657-659PubMed Google Scholar), which in most cases requires two rounds of PCR but only a single mutagenic oligonucleotide primer. The mutagenic oligonucleotides used in this study are listed in Table I. Taq DNA polymerase was used for DNA amplification. To avoid unwanted mutations generated byTaq-catalyzed untemplated addition of nucleotides, fragments of the first PCR round were treated with T4 DNA polymerase, which removes 3′ overhangs. The products of the second PCR round were digested with appropriate restriction endonucleases, purified on agarose gels, and used to replace the respective fragments of plasmid pCH231-Sm. The complete sequences of synthetic DNAs were verified by the dideoxy chain termination method of Sanger et al. (16Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 551-559Crossref Scopus (52592) Google Scholar). Modified hoxN segments were introduced into a derivative of the A. eutrophus wild-type strain H16, 2O. Lenz and B. Friedrich, unpublished results. which harbors a large in-frame deletion in hoxN covering 768 bp. The allelic exchange procedure took advantage of the conditionally lethal sacBgene on vector pLO2 (14Lenz O. Schwartz E. Dernedde J. Eitinger M. Friedrich B. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 4385-4393Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Sucrose-resistant colonies were screened for full-length hoxN by PCR amplification. As described by Bernhard et al. (17Bernhard M. Schwartz E. Rietdorf J. Friedrich B. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 4522-4529Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), 1 ml of a fresh overnight culture grown in nutrient broth was concentrated 2-fold in distilled water and boiled for 5 min. 10 μl of this crude lysate was used for PCR.hoxN point mutations in A. eutrophus were confirmed by sequence determination of the amplified fragments. Genomic rearrangements adjacent to the recombination sites were excluded by PCR amplification of a segment spanning hoxN and the 5′ and 3′ neighboring regions.Table IMutagenic oligonucleotides used for amino acid replacementsMutantOrientation1-aOrientation of the oligonucleotide with respect to the orientation of the hoxN reading frame.

Open table in a new tab Nickel accumulation of E. coli CC118 harboring plasmid pCH231-Sm or derivatives was tested as described recently (7Wolfram L. Friedrich B. Eitinger T. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 1840-1843Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The cellular content of 63Ni is expressed as picomoles per milligram of protein. Urease (EC 3.5.1.5) activity of strain CC118 containing pKAU17 and pCH231-Sm or derivatives was determined upon growth in the presence of 500 nmNiCl2 by quantitating the rate of ammonium ion released from urea (7Wolfram L. Friedrich B. Eitinger T. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 1840-1843Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Alkaline phosphatase (EC 3.1.3.1) activity was assayed colorimetrically using 4-nitrophenyl phosphate as the substrate (6Eitinger T. Friedrich B. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 12: 1025-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The A. eutrophus soluble hydrogenase (SH; EC 1.12.1.2) was measured with permeabilized cells by monitoring H2-dependent reduction of NAD+ as described by Friedrich et al. (18Friedrich B. Heine E. Finck A. Friedrich C.G. J. Bacteriol. 1981; 145: 1144-1149Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Specific enzyme activities are given in units per milligram of protein. One unit of activity is defined as the amount of enzyme required to consume 1 μmol of substrate per min. Protein was estimated by the method of Lowry et al. (19Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were grown in Luria-Bertani broth, harvested, and resuspended in buffer containing 3% (w/v) SDS. 30 μg of protein was separated by SDS-PAGE (7.5% polyacrylamide) (20Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1972; 227: 680-685Crossref Scopus (206961) Google Scholar) and electroblotted onto nitrocellulose membranes. Immunoblots were developed as described recently (6Eitinger T. Friedrich B. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 12: 1025-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In the course of site-directed mutagenesis we identified an error in hoxN. An additional G is present between bases 1,102 and 1,103 of the published sequence (5Eitinger T. Friedrich B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3222-3227Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) giving an open reading frame of 1,053 bp. Thus, the deduced polypeptide consists of 351 rather than 301 amino acid residues and has a molecular mass of 38.9 kDa. Computer analyses of the corrected nucleotide sequence predicted a membrane-spanning segment in the new C-terminal part of the HoxN protein. The previous topological analysis, which was confined to the first 301 amino acids, identified seven transmembrane helices (6Eitinger T. Friedrich B. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 12: 1025-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Data for additional alkaline phosphatase and β-galactosidase fusions to residues 300 and 351 of the permease, respectively (not shown), support the assumption of an eighth membrane-spanning helix in the C-terminal part of the protein. The revised topological model is shown in Fig. 1. Mutations in single cysteine codons of hoxN were generated by PCR using the mutagenic oligonucleotide primers listed in Table Iand plasmid pCH231-Sm as template. This procedure led to the isolation of permease mutants with Cys-37, Cys-256, Cys-318, or Cys-331 replaced by Ala. Double and triple mutants and a quadruple mutant with two, three, and four Cys to Ala exchanges, respectively, were obtained as follows. C256A/C318A, C256A/C331A, and C318A/C331A mutants were generated via PCR using single mutation plasmids as templates. The C37A/C256A, C37A/C318A, and C37A/C331A derivatives were constructed by insertion of a 303-bp ClaI/Bsu36I fragment with the respective 3′ mutation into a plasmid carrying the C37A mutation. Both strategies were used to generate the four triple mutants. Introduction of the 303-bp fragment corresponding to the C256A/C318A/C331A triple mutant into the C37A plasmid yielded the cysteine-less quadruple mutant. His-62 exchanges were produced via PCR using an oligonucleotide primer with a “three-base wobble” (TableI) at the relevant position. This method permitted the isolation of mutants with H62A, H62I, and H62S replacements. Additional His-62 mutants, obtained by this strategy, were not further analyzed since spontaneous second site mutations had occurred during PCR amplification. Asp-67 and His-68 mutants were constructed using the mutagenic primers listed in Table I. The H62I/H68I double mutant was obtained by introduction of a 96-bp AccI/MscI fragment containing the H68I mutation into a plasmid harboring the H62I mutation. To investigate the role of the residues Cys-37, Cys-256, Cys-318, and Cys-331 in Ni2+ uptake we assayed Ni2+accumulation and urease activity of E. coli CC118 producing altered HoxN proteins with single or multiple Cys replacements. The results are shown in Table II. E. colitransformants producing the wild-type A. eutrophus nickel permease accumulated 34 pmol of Ni2+ per mg of protein and displayed a urease activity of 581 milliunits per mg of protein. In comparison, the control strain with an inactivated hoxNaccumulated 1.7 pmol of Ni2+ per mg of protein and showed a urease activity of 27 milliunits per mg of protein. Both Ni2+ accumulation and urease activities were unaffected by the C37A exchange. The C256A mutant harboring a replacement within transmembrane helix VI (Fig. 1) showed 80% of the wild-type level of Ni2+ accumulation and 60% of the urease activity suggesting that Cys-256 is not essential for metal ion transport. A mutation resulting in the replacement of Cys-318 by Ala led to a slight but reproducible increase of Ni2+ uptake. Cys-318 is located within the fourth periplasmic loop connecting helices VII and VIII (Fig. 1). It is tempting to speculate that this residue has metal binding capacity but is not part of the substrate recognition domain, and thus, its replacement may increase Ni2+ transport across the membrane. Among the Cys single mutants, the C331A exchange gave the strongest response resulting in a 50–70% decrease in Ni2+ uptake. The analysis of Cys double and triple mutants (data not shown) did not add to the information obtained with the single replacements. None of the mutants harboring the C331A exchange had more than 50% of the Ni2+ uptake activity compared with the wild-type HoxN. This also applies to the cysteine-less quadruple mutant that shows only 30% of the normal Ni2+accumulation and urease activities (Table II).Table IIEffect of histidine and cysteine mutations in HoxN on Ni 2+ accumulation and urease activity of recombinant E. coliMutantNi2+accumulation2-aValues represent the averages of at least three independent experiments.Urease activity2-bActivities are the means of double or triple independent assays.pmol/mg proteinmilliunits/mg proteinParent34.0581HoxN−(hoxN::TnphoA)<227C37A35.4589C256A27.0330C318A40.5614C331A17.9185C37A/C256A/C318A/C331A10.7169H62A2.856H62I2.227H62S7.394D67E<248D67N<247H68I<258H68S<233H62I/H68I<252For 63Ni2+ accumulation assays E. coli CC118 harboring wild-type hoxN or derivatives was grown in Luria-Bertani broth in the presence of 500 nm63NiCl2 (30 TBq/mol).

Urease assays were performed with E. coli CC118 containing mutatedhoxN sequences on derivatives of plasmid pCH231-Sm and theK. aerogenes urease operon on plasmid pKAU17. In the course of recently reported sequence alignments of nickel transport proteins (7Wolfram L. Friedrich B. Eitinger T. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 1840-1843Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) we identified the conserved motif His-Xaa4-Asp-His that resembles the Ni(II)-binding site of human serum albumin and is located within the second transmembrane helix of the HoxN-type permeases (3Eitinger T. Friedrich B. Winkelmann G. Carrano C. Transition Metals in Microbial Metabolism. Harwood Academic Publishers, London1997: 235-256Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). Since this was the first hint to a substrate-binding domain in these proteins we investigated the significance of this signature for the activity of the A. eutrophus HoxN. His-62 was replaced by Ala, Ile, and Ser; Asp-67 by Asn and Glu; and His-68 by Ile and Ser. The effect on Ni2+ accumulation and urease-enhancing activity was monitored in E. coli. The replacements had clear-cut effects. Exchanging His-62 to Ile abolished Ni2+ uptake almost completely, and the H62A mutant showed only marginal activity, while the H62S mutant contained residual activity of approximately 20% (Table II). These results are compatible with the notion that the nature of the amino acid side chain at position 62 of the permease is critical. On the other hand, all Asp-67 and His-68 mutants were totally devoid of activity (Table II). To exclude the possibility that diminished transport activity of the mutants is due to altered gene expression, defective insertion of the permease into the membrane, or enhanced proteolysis, we studied the influence of the mutations on HoxN levels by Western immunoblot analysis. Since an antibody against HoxN is not available, we took advantage of a previously described fusion of E. coli PhoA to HoxN (6Eitinger T. Friedrich B. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 12: 1025-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In this construct (P291) PhoA is fused to amino acid 291 of HoxN and faces the periplasm (Fig. 2). P291 derivatives with exchanges at position 62, 67, and 68 were generated by introducing a 1.3-kilobase XhoI/MscI fragment containing the respective mutation into the parent P291 gene fusion. PhoA activities of P291 derivatives were measured, and the amount of the fusion proteins in the E. coli CC118 membrane was determined by immunoblotting using an anti-PhoA antibody. The results are shown in Fig. 2. Comparable quantities of P291 were detected irrespective of the His-62, Asp-67, and His-68 exchanges, and each fusion displayed PhoA activity. A remarkable decrease of this activity was observed for the D67N and H68I mutants. Nevertheless, these results indicate that the altered permeases are present in similar amounts and correctly oriented in the membrane. To assay the mutant permeases in the homologous background we reintroduced the amino acid exchanges into theA. eutrophus wild-type strain. Ni2+ transport experiments assaying the activity of HoxN in A. eutrophus or in recombinant E. coli do not yield reliable results since nonspecific binding of Ni2+ to the cell envelope and interference by the Mg2+ transport systems hinder kinetic analyses. Therefore, we monitored the effect of the replacements on the activity of the SH, a nickel-containing enzyme of A. eutrophus. The results are summarized in Table III. Surprisingly, the His-62 mutants were not impaired in SH activity when the cells were grown in a mineral salts medium supplemented with 100 nm NiCl2. Under these conditions, however, SH activity of a strain with a deletion in hoxN was clearly reduced. These results indicate that His-62 exchanges have no effect on the apparent activity of the nickel permease under these circumstances. In an additional experiment, the SH activity of mutants grown in mineral medium that was not supplemented with NiCl2 was measured. Under Ni2+ starvation, only 10% of SH activity was detectable in the wild-type strain and in the H62A and H62S mutants. SH activity in the H62I strain was less than 3% and was almost undetectable in the hoxN deletion mutant. These results indicate that His-62 has a significant effect on the affinity of the permease for the Ni2+ ion. Experimental support for this conclusion was obtained by growing the cells in a medium containing 100 nm NiCl2 and 10 μmnitrilotriacetate (NTA), a well known Ni2+ chelator. In this case Ni2+ is present almost exclusively in the form of NTA complexes. Addition of the metal-complexing agent did not affect SH activity in the wild-type strain but completely abolished the SH activity in the strain lacking HoxN. SH activities of the H62A, H62I, and H62S mutants were 65, 40, and 75%, respectively, compared with the wild type. In the presence of 50 μm NTA, the SH activities of the mutants were reduced to background levels. The Asp-67 and His-68 mutations as well as the H62I/H68I double mutation inhoxN had a dramatic effect. SH activities of these strains were almost undetectable under any conditions of nickel limitation tested. These results confirm that wild-type HoxN mediates maximal Ni2+ uptake even at extremely low substrate concentrations. Amino acid exchanges at positions 67 and 68 apparently inactivate the permease whereas exchanges at position 62 interfere with the affinity of the transporter for Ni2+ ion.Table IIIEffect of His-62, Asp-67, and His-68 replacements in the nickel permease on soluble hydrogenase activity of A. eutrophusMutantSoluble hydrogenase activity3-aValues represent the averages of duplicates.0100 nm NiCl2100 nmNiCl2 + 10 μm NTA100 nmNiCl2 + 50 μm NTAmillunits/mg proteinA. eutrophus H16 (wild type)1001,3001,3501,000HoxN−(hoxNΔ)<50100 (900)3-bThe Mg2+ concentration in this experiment was only 100 μm.

Ni2+-specific transport systems have been shown to play a key role in the synthesis of bacterial NiFe hydrogenases and ureases that are involved in energy and nitrogen metabolism of the respective species (reviewed in Ref. 3Eitinger T.

Microbiol. 1995; 16: 97-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar)). These systems show a common topology with eight membrane-spanning segments (reviewed in Ref. 3Eitinger T. Friedrich B. Winkelmann G. Carrano C. Transition Metals in Microbial Metabolism. Harwood Academic Publishers, London1997: 235-256Google Scholar). The UreH protein of thermophilic Bacillus strain TB-90 (9Maeda M. Hidaka M. Nakamura H. Masaki H. Uozumi T. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 432-442Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), implicated in Ni2+ transport and clearly related to the one-component systems, probably contains less than eight transmembrane helices. An important feature of these Ni2+ transport systems is their ion selectivity allowing sufficient Ni2+uptake even in environments where only traces of the transition metal ion are available. In a very recent study (23Komeda H. Kobayashi M. Shimizu S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 36-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), a novel transporter (NhlF) mediating Co2+ uptake in the Gram-positive bacteriumRhodococcus rhodochrous J1 was described. This organism produces two types of cobalt-containing nitrile hydratases. Interestingly, NhlF is homologous to the one-component nickel permeases. Alignments revealed more than 35% amino acid sequence identity between NhlF and HoxN, HupN, and NixA (23Komeda H. Kobayashi M. Shimizu S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 36-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, NhlF does not catalyze Ni2+ transport. Co2+transport, however, was inhibited by a 500-fold excess of Ni2+ ion, while other divalent cations had no effect (23Komeda H. Kobayashi M. Shimizu S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 36-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Thus, learning how these systems discriminate among divalent cations is essential for an understanding of the transport mechanism. In theE. coli Nik system, ion selectivity may be inherent to the periplasmic binding protein. In the case of the one-component permeases, specificity is an intrinsic property of the membrane proteins. The present study represents a first attempt to gain insight into the structure-function relationship of the nickel permease (HoxN) ofA. eutrophus. Using site-directed mutagenesis we introduced amino acid replacements in a putative nickel binding motif and at the positions occupied by Cys residues. These Cys residues are not conserved in the one-component Ni2+ transport systems, but nevertheless thiol groups are candidates for metal recognition. Evidence obtained with the Cys single, double, triple, and quadruple mutants suggests that Cys-331, located within transmembrane helix VIII, is the only Cys residue that could be directly involved in substrate recognition. Although not leading to a detailed insight into the transport mechanism, the availability of the Cys-less quadruple mutant is helpful for further studies such as cysteine-scanning mutagenesis. The latter technique in connection with excimer fluorescence labeling or permease probing with impermeant SH-reactive agents was successfully applied in studies on the three-dimensional structure of the lactose permease (21Jung K. Jung H. Wu J. Privé G.G. Kaback H.R. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 12272-12278Crossref Scopus (132) Google Scholar) and the mechanism of the glucose 6-phosphate/phosphate antiporter of E. coli (22Yan R.-T. Maloney P.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5973-5976Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Cys-free variants are a prerequisite for this approach. Replacements of His-62, Asp-67, and His-68, which are conserved in bacterial nickel permeases (3Eitinger T. Friedrich B. Winkelmann G. Carrano C. Transition Metals in Microbial Metabolism. Harwood Academic Publishers, London1997: 235-256Google Scholar, 7Wolfram L. Friedrich B. Eitinger T. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 1840-1843Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), had clear-cut effects in the physiological assay system. Mutant permeases were dramatically impaired in Ni2+ uptake when cells were grown in complex medium containing 1% tryptically digested protein and 0.5% yeast extract. This medium has a strong metal-chelating capacity. Under these conditions, altered permeases harboring hydrophobic residues at position 62 were almost completely unable to mediate Ni2+uptake. A hydrophilic Ser residue at this position, however, correlated with a residual activity. All Asp-67 and His-68 exchanges inactivated the permease. These results suggest that all three residues of the conserved motif participate in substrate recognition. Introduction of the mutations into A. eutrophus and measurement of the effects on Ni2+ uptake confirmed this assumption. In the presence of free Ni2+ in a mineral medium, the permeases altered at position 62 were capable of metal ion uptake. At an extremely low Ni2+ concentration or in the presence of Ni2+ complexed with nitrilotriacetate, however, transport activity was clearly reduced indicating that the nature of the side chain at position 62 is important for affinity. Of particular importance for further investigations is the finding published by Komeda et al. (23Komeda H. Kobayashi M. Shimizu S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 36-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) that the Co2+transporter of R. rhodochrous reveals significant sequence similarity with the A. eutrophus HoxN and contains the His-Xaa4-Asp-His motif. The presence of this putative Ni2+ binding motif could explain the inhibition of Co2+ uptake by Ni2+ ion. On the other hand, previous uptake experiments (24Lohmeyer M. Friedrich C.G. Arch. Microbiol. 1987; 149: 130-135Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar) and the analysis of Ni2+ accumulation in the present study (data not shown) indicated that HoxN-mediated Ni2+ transport is only slightly affected in the presence of Co2+ ion. This suggests that HoxN lacks a Co2+-binding site. Although much more work remains to be done, the results presented in this report are a basis for elucidating the principles of ion recognition of metal-specific permeases.

https://openalex.org/W2016588422,"We have used polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of tandem repeats to study the pattern of allelic loss on chromosome 7q31 in invasive epithelial ovarian carcinomas and borderline ovarian tumors. Using 13 primer sets spanning loci from 7q31 to 7q32, 16 borderline and 54 invasive ovarian tumor tissue, together with their corresponding normal tissue, were analysed. Invasive epithelial ovarian tumors demonstrated loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at one or more loci on 7q in 32 of 54 cases (59%). The invasive epithelial ovarian tumors demonstrated the highest percentage of LOH at the loci D7S643 (20 of 40 informative cases, 50%) and GATA44F09 (18 of 42 informative cases, 43%). In contrary, only one borderline ovarian tumor showed LOH at one locus (GATA44F09, one of 14 informative cases, 7%). Our results display a sharp contrast in the pattern of LOH between invasive and borderline ovarian tumors suggesting that allelic loss at chromosome 7q31.3 may be involved in the development and progression of invasive epithelial ovarian tumors but not borderline ovarian tumors. Further analysis of the deletion map for the invasive epithelial ovarian tumors showed two regions likely to harbor ovarian tumor suppressor genes including a novel 1300 kilobase common loss region flanked by GATA44F09 and D7S643."
https://openalex.org/W1993955887,"Nerve growth factor (NGF) functions as a progression factor with both mitogenic and antimitogenic activities. When PC12 cells are treated with NGF, they advance to the G1stage of the cell cycle before they differentiate. The correlation between cessation of proliferation and differentiation suggests that the antimitotic activity of NGF may be obligatory for differentiation. Although epidermal growth factor- (EGF) and NGF-treated PC12 cells share several common properties, including activation of the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase pathway and induction of immediate early genes, EGF is mitogenic for PC12 cells and does not normally stimulate differentiation. However, combinations of EGF and low levels of cAMP stimulate differentiation even though neither agent alone does (Mark, M. D., Liu, Y., Wong, S. T., Hinds, T. R., and Storm, D.R. (1995) J. Cell Biol. 130, 701–710). Since EGF is mitogenic for PC12 cells and differentiation may not occur until proliferation is inhibited, differentiation caused by cAMP and EGF may be due to the antiproliferative activity of cAMP. To test this hypothesis, we examined the effect of EGF or combinations of EGF and cAMP on PC12 cell proliferation. EGF alone stimulated proliferation of PC12 cells and increased the levels of several cell cycle progression factors including cdk2, cdk4, and cyclin B1. Cyclic AMP inhibited the EGF-stimulated increases in cell cycle progression factors as well as proliferation. Other antiproliferative agents including rapamycin, mimosine, and nitric oxide agonists also synergized with EGF to stimulate differentiation. These data indicate that the coupling of antiproliferative signals with EGF modifies the biological properties of EGF and converts it to a differentiating growth factor.

Neuronal differentiation of PC12 cells by nerve growth factor (NGF) 1The abbreviations used are: NGF, nerve growth factor; EGF, epidermal growth factor; MAP, mitogen-activated protein; HRP, horseradish peroxidase. is characterized by several changes including growth arrest, activation of specific genes, and neuritogenesis. A critical step for differentiation is arrest of the cell cycle. Although NGF treatment initially stimulates proliferation, this is followed by cessation of DNA synthesis and cell division (1Buchkovich K. Ziff E.B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 1226-1241Crossref Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 2Greene L.A. Tischler A.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 2424-2428Crossref PubMed Scopus (4873) Google Scholar, 3Gunning P.W.

In addition, an asynchronous population of PC12 cells accumulates in a G1-like state following NGF treatment (5Burstein D.E. Greene L.A. Dev. Biol. 1982; 94: 477-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 6Rudkin B.B. Lazarovici P. Levi B.Z. Abe Y. Fujita K. Guroff G. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 3319-3325Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). These findings imply that the cessation of cell proliferation in G1 may be crucial for neuronal differentiation. Although the mechanism by which NGF arrests PC12 cells in G1 phase is not fully understood, there appears to be a direct correlation between the differential regulation of specific cell cycle regulatory components and NGF-induced differentiation (1Buchkovich K. Ziff E.B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 1226-1241Crossref Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 7Yan G.Z. Ziff E.B. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 6200-6212Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). EGF- and NGF-treated PC12 cells share several common properties, including activation of the MAP kinase pathway, induction of immediate early genes (IEGs), membrane ruffling, and increased cell adhesion (8Connolly J.L.

In contrast to NGF, EGF is a potent mitogen that does not stimulate differentiation (13Cohen S. Dev. Biol. 1965; 12: 394-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). However, the molecular mechanisms differentiating these two growth factors are not fully understood. EGF, in combination with low levels of cAMP (50% increases above basal), stimulate differentiation of PC12 cells (14Mark M.D. Liu Y. Wong S.T. Hinds T.R. Storm D.R. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 701-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), whereas cAMP alone does not. Differentiation stimulated by EGF and cAMP is blocked by inhibitors of transcription as well as inhibitors of the MAP kinase and protein kinase A signal transduction systems indicating that activation of both pathways is required. This is particularly interesting since it suggests that pairing of two signals, one generated through the cAMP pathway and the other via the MAP kinase pathway, stimulates neuronal differentiation. The purpose of this study was to determine if cAMP inhibits increases in DNA synthesis and proliferation caused by EGF. Our data indicate that physiologically relevant cAMP signals and other antiproliferative agents synergize with EGF to differentiate PC12 cells. Monoclonal cyclin B1, polyclonal cdk2, and polyclonal cdk4 antibodies were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Secondary antibodies used were either goat anti-mouse IgG-horseradish peroxidase (HRP) conjugated from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc. (West Grove, PA) or goat anti-rabbit IgG-HRP conjugated from Life Technologies, Inc. (Grand Island, NY). PC12 cells were maintained at 37 °C in high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 1% penicillin and streptomycin, 5% bovine calf serum, and 10% fetal bovine serum in a humidified 95% air, 5% CO2 incubator. Cells were subcultured onto poly-l-lysine (50 mg/ml) coated tissue culture dishes. When the cultures reached 20–30% confluency, cells were treated with various effectors 24–48 h after plating. MAP kinase was assayed by the general method of Gotoh et al (9Gotoh Y. Nishida E. Yamashita T. Hoshi M. Kawakami M. Sakai H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 193: 661-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar) using myelin basic protein as a substrate. A mouse anti-MAP kinase monoclonal antibody was purchased from Zymed Laboratories. PC12 cells were incubated with 50 ng/ml NGF, 50 ng/ml EGF, or 50 ng/ml EGF + 50 μm dibutyryl-cAMP for varying periods of time as indicated. Cell extracts were prepared for MAP kinase immunoprecipitation and kinase reactions in SDS-polyacrylamide gels were carried out as described in the product information bulletin from Zymed Laboratories. Gels were incubated at room temperature for 1 h in 10 ml of 40 mm Hepes, pH 8.0, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 100 μm EGTA, 5 mm MgCl2, 25 μm ATP with [γ-32P]ATP (250 μCi; 1 μCi = 37 kBq). The gels were vigorously washed in 5% trichloroacetic acid, 1% NaPPi, dried, and exposed to x-ray film for 10–12 h. MAP kinase activities are expressed as relative activities determined by scanning the exposed film with a Bio-Rad GS-670 densitometer. Treatment of PC12 cells with cAMP alone causes transient neurite outgrowth that is not dependent upon transcription. In a previous study, we established that neurite outgrowth stimulated by combinations of EGF and cAMP measured after 14 days is nontransient and dependent upon transcription (14Mark M.D. Liu Y. Wong S.T. Hinds T.R. Storm D.R. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 701-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Therefore, neurite outgrowth was monitored as an indicator of PC12 differentiation. Cells were treated with various effectors at the indicated concentrations for 14 days. Cells were photographed, and neurite lengths were quantitated from photographs of cells using a ruler. Values for neurite lengths are an average from three independent experiments ± S.D. (n = 200 cells). Cells were treated with various effectors and harvested every odd day for 11 days. Harvested cells were diluted, and total cell number was counted on a hemacytometer. Values for total cell number are expressed as percentage change compared with untreated cells from one representative experiment. At least three independent experiments were performed for each set of conditions. Cells were treated with various effectors in triplicate at the indicated concentrations. PC12 cells were then pulse-labeled with 2 mCi/ml [3H]thymidine in fresh Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 1% penicillin and streptomycin, 5% bovine calf serum, and 10% fetal bovine serum for 2 h at 37 °C in a humidified 95% air, 5% CO2incubator. After 2 h, cells were rinsed twice with 5% trichloroacetic acid at 4 °C and drained. Cells were lysed in 1 ml of 0.25 m NaOH for 10 min at room temperature on a platform shaker. Samples were then transferred to scintillation vials containing 10 ml of EcoLite and counted for [3H]thymidine incorporation. Cells were harvested every odd day for 11 days. Values for [3H]thymidine incorporation are expressed as a percentage change compared with untreated cells from one representative experiment. At least three independent experiments were performed. Cells were treated with various effectors at the indicated concentrations for 0, 1, 3, 6, or 9 days. They were harvested by scraping dishes and were sonicated in ice-cold lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 25 mg/ml leupeptin, 25 mg/ml aprotinin, 25 mg/ml pepstatin, 1 mmsodium vanadate). Undissolved debris was cleared by microcentrifugation at 4 °C. Protein concentrations were determined according to the methods of Bradford (15Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar). Equal amounts of lysate (50 μg of protein/lane) were boiled for 5 min in Laemmli sample buffer, run on 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and transferred to nitrocellulose. Western blots were performed using the Amersham ECL kit according to the manufacturer instructions (Amersham Corp.). Briefly, the nitrocellulose membranes were blocked in 0.4% gelatin from cold water fish skin (purchased from Sigma) in TTBS (50 mm Tris, 50 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20) for 30 min at room temperature and then incubated with primary antibody for 1 h at room temperature. The primary antibodies were used at 1:1000 dilution. Blots were washed 3 times for 15 min in TTBS and then incubated in 1:5000 dilution of secondary antibody conjugated to HRP in 0.4% gelatin from cold water fish skin and TTBS for 1 h at room temperature. They were exposed on autoradiography film for various times, and the relative density of the bands was quantitated by scanning films with a Bio-Rad GS-670 densitometer and plotted as percentage change in expression relative to untreated cells. In a previous report, we discovered that pairing of low cAMP signals with EGF stimulated differentiation of PC 12 cells. The increases in cAMP required for this effect were only 50–80% above basal cAMP. cAMP increases of this magnitude are generated with 50 μmdibutyryl-cAMP or 0.1 μm forskolin. Since NGF differentiates PC12 cells and stimulates a larger increase in MAP kinase activity than EGF, it might be argued that pairing of cAMP with EGF causes differentiation because cAMP enhances MAP kinase activity. To address this issue, we monitored MAP kinase activity in the presence of EGF, EGF + 50 μm dibutyryl cAMP, or NGF (Fig.1). As expected, NGF caused a greater and more prolonged increase in MAP kinase activity than EGF alone. EGF + 50 μm dibutyryl did not stimulate MAP kinase activity beyond that seen with EGF alone. Therefore, differentiation caused by EGF and cAMP is not due to increases in MAP kinase activity above that caused by EGF. To determine if proliferation of PC12 cells stimulated by EGF is inhibited by increases in intracellular cAMP, we quantitated proliferation and [3H]thymidine incorporation after treatment with EGF, or EGF with cAMP-elevating agents including forskolin and cholera toxin. Forskolin and cholera toxin increase intracellular cAMP by direct activation of adenylyl cyclase or activation of Gs, respectively. The effects of growth factors or cAMP on cell number and [3H]thymidine incorporation are expressed as increases relative to untreated controls. Treatment of PC12 cells with 0.5 μm forskolin, 50 μm dibutyryl-cAMP, or 50 ng/ml cholera toxin increases cAMP approximately 50–80% above basal (14Mark M.D. Liu Y. Wong S.T. Hinds T.R. Storm D.R. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 701-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Forskolin or cholera toxin reduced proliferation by 46 and 63%, respectively (Fig. 2, B and C). As expected, EGF stimulated proliferation. The number of cells increased approximately 300% after 9 days of treatment. EGF-stimulated proliferation was almost completely inhibited by all three cAMP elevating agents. These data indicate that relatively small cAMP increases inhibit EGF-stimulated proliferation. Another indicator of growth arrest is a reduction in DNA synthesis. To determine the relative changes in DNA synthesis, [3H]thymidine incorporation was monitored after treatment with EGF or EGF with cAMP. EGF increased [3H]thymidine incorporation approximately 228% by day 11 of treatment (Fig.3). Forskolin, or cholera toxin alone did not cause significant changes in [3H]thymidine incorporation relative to untreated cells (Fig. 3, B and C). However, these agents inhibited the increase in [3H]thymidine incorporation caused by EGF. If stimulation of differentiation by combinations of EGF and cAMP is attributable to the antiproliferative activity of cAMP, then other antiproliferative agents should also differentiate PC12 cells when administered with EGF. To test this hypothesis, PC12 cells were treated with EGF plus rapamycin, mimosine, aphidicolin, or nitric oxide (NO) agonists SIN-1, SNAP, and SNP. Mimosine and aphidicolin arrest cells in G1 by inhibiting ribonucleotide reductase and DNA polymerase activity, respectively. Rapamycin causes growth cessation in G1 phase by inhibiting pp70S6K. NO agonists decrease the proliferation and DNA synthesis of PC12 cells and cause accumulation of cells in the G2 phase (16Peunova N. Enikolopov G. Nature. 1995; 375: 68-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). EGF-treated PC12 cells showed no significant neurite outgrowth (Fig.4 A). Treatment of PC12 cells with antiproliferative agents alone did not stimulate significant neurite outgrowth. However, combinations of EGF with cAMP stimulated stable neurite outgrowth that persisted for at least 2 weeks (Fig.4 B). Furthermore, EGF with rapamycin or aphidicolin promoted extensive neurite outgrowth (Fig. 4, C and D), as did EGF in combination with NO agonists SIN-1 and SNAP (Fig. 4,E and F). Quantitation of this data is summarized in Fig. 5. EGF or dibutyryl-cAMP alone induced only minor increases in average neurite length, averaging 4.4 ± 1.0 to 3.5 ± 1.6 mm, respectively (Fig. 5 A). The antiproliferative agents rapamycin, mimosine, and aphidicolin also produced small increases in average neurite lengths ranging from 3.0 ± 1.1 to 6.8 ± 0.7 mm. Average neurites produced by EGF plus mimosine (19.9 ± 2.5 mm) or aphidicolin (22.5 ± 2.8 mm) were comparable with cells treated with EGF + dibutyryl-cAMP (16.8 ± 1.3 mm) or NGF (19.1 ± 2.1 mm). Similarly, cells treated with EGF + SIN-1, SNAP, or SIN-1 showed average process lengths of 17.2 ± 2.0, 16.9 ± 1.6, and 12.5 ± 3.1 mm, respectively (Fig. 5 B). These data demonstrate that EGF promotes differentiation of PC12 cells when paired with various antiproliferative agents. Since the mechanisms for the antiproliferative activity of these drugs differ, differentiation is dependent upon inhibition of cell growth, regardless of which antiproliferative mechanism is operative. Interestingly, differentiation of PC12 cells by NGF is not dependent upon cAMP (3Gunning P.W. Landreth G.E. Bothwell M.A. Shooter E.M. J. Cell Biol. 1981; 89: 240-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Furthermore, treatment of PC12 cells did not increase intracellular cAMP (data not shown).Figure 5Average PC12 cell neurite length stimulated by combinations of EGF and antiproliferative agents.

Ziff E.B. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 6200-6212Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The correlation between NGF-stimulated differentiation and a decrease in regulatory components of the cell cycle suggests that NGF may decrease proliferation of PC12 cells by controlling the expression of these proteins. Since EGF and antiproliferative agents induce differentiation, we quantitated the expression of several cell cycle regulatory proteins important for G1/S and G2/M transitions. The expression of cdk2, cdk4, and cyclin B1 was examined after exposure to EGF or EGF with cAMP. As with previous experiments, the concentrations of forskolin, cholera toxin, or dibutyryl-cAMP used increased intracellular cAMP by 50%. EGF-treated cells displayed a significant increase in cdk2 expression, reaching a maximum of +694% (Fig. 6). This is consistent with induction of proliferation by EGF and the fact that cdk2 is crucial for progression from G1 to S phase (17Elledge S.J. Richman R. Hall F.L. Williams R.T. Lodgson N.

EGF caused a marked increase in cdk4 that was blocked by dibutyryl-cAMP, forskolin, or cholera toxin (Fig.7).Figure 7Inhibition of EGF-stimulated cdk4 expression by cAMP. A, changes in cdk4 expression following treatment with 50 ng/ml EGF, 50 μm dibutyryl-cAMP, or 50 ng/ml EGF + 50 μm dibutyryl-cAMP were quantitated and expressed as the percent change in expression relative to untreated cells.B, changes in cdk4 expression following treatment with 50 ng/ml EGF, 0.5 μm forskolin, or 50 ng/ml EGF + 0.5 μm forskolin were quantitated and expressed as the percent change in expression relative to untreated cells.

PC12 cells were treated with various effectors and analyzed for cdk4 expression as described under “Experimental Procedures.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Cyclin B1 is a key regulatory component for the G2/M phase transition in the cell cycle. An induction of cyclin B1 in S/G2followed by cAMP-mediated degradation of cyclin B is necessary for the completion of mitosis (21Grieco D. Porcellini A. Avvedimento E.A. Gottesman M.E. Sci. 1996; 271: 1718-1723Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Therefore, cyclin B1 expression was also examined after treatment with EGF. EGF treatment of PC12 cells increased cyclin B1 expression by approximately 147% above untreated cells (Fig. 8). Dibutyryl-cAMP, forskolin, and cholera toxin also caused a transient elevation in cyclin B1 expression that subsequently decreased after several days (Fig. 8). A similar pattern of cyclin B1 expression was also evident when EGF was paired with cAMP elevating agents. There was an initial rise in cyclin B1 expression that decreased below basal levels 6 days after addition of EGF and cAMP elevating agents. This initial rise in cyclin B may be caused by EGF-stimulated growth through G1/S phase transitions followed by cAMP-mediated degradation of cyclin B during mitosis (21Grieco D. Porcellini A. Avvedimento E.A. Gottesman M.E. Sci. 1996; 271: 1718-1723Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). In a previous study, we reported that EGF in combination with low levels of cAMP stimulates differentiation of PC12 cells (14Mark M.D. Liu Y. Wong S.T. Hinds T.R. Storm D.R. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 701-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The cAMP increases necessary to convert EGF to a differentiating agent are well within normal physiological limits, approximately 50% over basal. Neither EGF alone nor cAMP at low levels promotes differentiation. This phenomenon is dependent upon activation of the MAP kinase pathway coupled with stimulation of the cAMP signal transduction system (14Mark M.D. Liu Y. Wong S.T. Hinds T.R. Storm D.R. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 701-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). We hypothesize that the antiproliferative activity of cAMP may contribute to this phenomenon because cells must stop dividing before they can differentiate. The objectives of this study were to determine if low level cAMP signals inhibit EGF-stimulated proliferation, to determine if cAMP signals of this magnitude affect the expression of proteins important for cell cycle progression, and to determine if other antiproliferative agents act with EGF to stimulate differentiation. High levels of cAMP, generated by 10–100 μm forskolin, cause transient neurite outgrowth. However, neurites produced under these conditions are not stable, and the cells are not permanently differentiated. It is also unlikely that cAMP increases produced by 10–100 μm forskolin are physiologically relevant; they exceed cAMP increases produced by neurotransmitters, Ca2+, or combinations of effectors. Activation of the cAMP signal transduction system alone is not sufficient to cause differentiation of PC12 cells. The changes produced by high cAMP are not dependent upon transcription and are transient. EGF stimulated increases in cell number, DNA synthesis, and several cell cycle progression factors that were inhibited by cAMP. The concentrations of these agents used were selected to generate cAMP increases approximately 50% above basal since we had previously shown that cAMP signals of this magnitude will differentiate PC12 cells treated with EGF (14Mark M.D. Liu Y. Wong S.T. Hinds T.R. Storm D.R. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 701-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). These data suggest that the antiproliferative activity of cAMP may contribute to differentiation caused by cAMP + EGF. If this hypothesis is valid, then other antiproliferative agents might also synergize with EGF to stimulate differentiation. Indeed, several antimitotic agents including rapamycin, mimosine, aphidicolin and NO-generating agents differentiated PC12 cells in combination with EGF. Other data in the literature support the general hypothesis that inhibition of proliferation must precede neuronal differentiation. Development of the mammalian embryonic nervous system involves an initial burst of cell division. Neurons then become terminally postmitotic, differentiate, and form postsynaptic connections. Interestingly, PC12 cells behave in a similar manner when treated with NGF. There is an initial proliferation of cells, followed by a cessation of growth, and then cells differentiate. NGF functions as a progression factor, possessing both mitogenic and antimitogenic activities (6Rudkin B.B. Lazarovici P. Levi B.Z. Abe Y. Fujita K. Guroff G. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 3319-3325Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). The antimitogenic activity of NGF is mediated by NO; treatment of PC12 cells with NGF induces the expression of nitric oxide synthase (16Peunova N. Enikolopov G. Nature. 1995; 375: 68-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). Cessation of proliferation appears to be a prerequisite for neuronal differentiation in NGF-treated PC12 cells and does not occur when cells are treated with EGF alone. EGF is a known mitogen for PC12 cells (22Huff K. End D. Guroff G. J. Cell Biol. 1981; 88: 189-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar), whereas cAMP is antimitogenic, inhibits DNA synthesis, and accumulates cells in G2/M phase (23Bothwell M.A. Schechter A.L. Vaughn K.M. Cell. 1980; 21: 857-868Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 24Huffaker T. Corcoran T. Wagner J.A. J. Cell.

Growth arrest during neuronal differentiation may be due to changes in expression of several key cell cycle proteins. The temporal correlation between cessation of proliferation, down-regulation of cell cycle regulatory protein expression, and neuronal differentiation supports this hypothesis. NGF-induced differentiation of PC12 cells decreases the expression of cdc2, cdk2, cdk4, cdk6, and cyclin B1 (1Buchkovich K. Ziff E.B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 1226-1241Crossref Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 7Yan G.Z. Ziff E.B. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 6200-6212Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A similar depression in cdc2 and cdk2 expression occurs in terminally differentiated N1E-115 cells (27Kraneburg O. Scharnhorst V. Van der Eb A.J. Zantema A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 227-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). We also observed a down-regulation of cdk2, cdk4, and cyclin B1 when PC12 cells were treated with EGF + cAMP. Cdk2 activity is essential for the progression from G1 to S phase (17Elledge S.J. Richman R. Hall F.L. Williams R.T. Lodgson N. Harper J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

EMBO J. 1992; 11: 961-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (1134) Google Scholar), and overexpression of cdk2 inhibits neuronal differentiation (30Dobashi Y. Kudoh T. Matsumine A. Toyoshima K. Akiyama T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23031-23037Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Since cAMP inhibited EGF-stimulated expression of cdk2, this may explain why cAMP inhibits the growth of EGF-treated cells. Similarly, cyclin B has been implicated in the G2/M transition because of its expression at this stage of the cell cycle (29Pagano M. Pepperkok R. Verde F. Ansorge W. Draetta G. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 961-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (1134) Google Scholar, 31Pines J. Hunter T. Cell. 1989; 58: 833-846Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar). Cyclic AMP modulates the expression of several key regulatory components of the cell cycle. An increase in expression of cyclin B followed by cAMP/protein kinase A-mediated degradation is crucial for the progression of cells from mitosis to interphase (21Grieco D. Porcellini A. Avvedimento E.A. Gottesman M.E. Sci. 1996; 271: 1718-1723Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Inhibition of protein kinase A by overexpression of the regulatory subunit during the onset of M phase results in growth arrest of cells during mitosis. However, growth arrest is reversed following the addition of cAMP enhancing agents. EGF + cAMP-induced neuronal differentiation resulted in an initial rise in cyclin B1 expression that decreased below basal levels by day 6 in PC12 cells. This initial rise in cyclin B may be caused by EGF-stimulated growth through G1/S phase transition followed by cAMP-mediated degradation of cyclin B during mitosis (21Grieco D. Porcellini A. Avvedimento E.A. Gottesman M.E. Sci. 1996; 271: 1718-1723Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Furthermore, cAMP blocks the mitogenic effects of colony-stimulating factor 1 (CSF-1) by increasing expression of p27Kip1, a cyclin D/cdk4 inhibitor, thus inducing mid-G1 phase growth arrest in macrophages (32Kato J.Y. Matsuoka M. Polyak K. Massague J. Sherr C.J. Cell. 1995; 79: 487-496Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (709) Google Scholar). Similar effects have also been seen in various cell lines following growth factor stimulation (33Sewing A. Burger C. Brusselbach S. Schalk C. Lucibello F.C. Muller R. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 104: 545-555Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34Vairo G. Argyriou S. Bordun A.-M. Whitty G. Hamilton J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2692-2701Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, cAMP inhibits growth factor-stimulated expression of G1 phase, cyclins D1 and E, and the activation of cyclin A- and cyclin E-dependent histone H1 kinases (33Sewing A. Burger C. Brusselbach S. Schalk C. Lucibello F.C. Muller R. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 104: 545-555Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 35Cocks B.G. Vairo G. Bodrug S.E. Hamilton J.A. J. Biol.

Commun. 1994; 205: 923-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Cyclic AMP induces G1 arrest, increases the critical cell size required for budding, and inhibits the expression of G1 phase cyclins, CLN1 and CLN2, in yeast. Mutations inactivating the regulatory subunit of protein kinase A or the cAMP-dependent phosphodiesterase cause G1 arrest that is reversed by inducing expression of CLN1 and CLN2 genes in yeast (37Baroni M.D. Monti P. Alberghina L. Nature. 1994; 371: 339-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 38Hartwell L. Nature. 1994; 371: 286Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 39Tokiwa G. Tyers M. Volpe T. Futcher B. Nature. 1994; 371: 342-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Collectively, these studies support the general hypothesis that cAMP-induced inhibition of cell cycle regulatory proteins may contribute to differentiation stimulated by EGF + cAMP. Our data indicate that cAMP in combination with EGF induces growth arrest, inhibits DNA synthesis, and promotes neuronal differentiation of PC12 cells. The temporal correlation between growth arrest induced by combinations of EGF and cAMP, depression of regulatory cell cycle components, and neuronal differentiation suggests that the antimitotic activity of cAMP contributes to this phenomena. In summary, pairing of antiproliferative signals with EGF modifies the biological properties of EGF and converts it to a differentiating growth factor. We thank Drs. Y. Liu, and J.-C. Deloulme for valuable discussions and reading of the manuscript."
https://openalex.org/W2318502986,"Mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) is an insertional mutagen that has been demonstrated to transcriptionally activate flanking cellular proto-oncogenes. Previously we have used MMTV infection to accelerate mammary tumorigenesis in Wnt1 transgenic mice in order to identify genes that cooperate with the Wnt1 oncogene. Initial investigations into the resulting tumor collection, screened primarily by Southern analysis, showed that three fibroblast growth factor genes, Fgf8, Fgf3 and Fgf4, sustain activating insertion mutations in 10%, 42% and 6% of the tumors, respectively. Here, in an examination of the tumors from MMTV-infected Wnt1 transgenic mice that emphasizes Northern analysis, we report transcriptional activation of Fgf8 in 30 additional tumors (increasing the percentage of activations to 50%), while no significant changes in the activation frequency of Fgf3 or Fgf4 were found. To determine the frequency of insertional activation in normal mice, we examined tumors from MMTV-infected nontransgenic littermates of the Wnt1 transgenics and from MMTV-infected BALB/c mice. Fgf8, Fgf3 and Fgf4 were found to be activated in 11%, 80% and 5%, respectively, of the tumors in the combined nontransgenic groups. Thus, there appears to be an increased predisposition for Fgf8 activations in Wnt1 transgenic mice versus normal mice, suggesting that cells expressing Wnt1 are especially sensitized to stimulation by FGF8 compared with FGF3 or FGF4. In contrast, the activation frequency of Fgf3 in tumors from MMTV-infected Wnt1 transgenic mice was approximately one-half that of normal mice. Our results show that this in vivo model of multistep tumorigenesis reveals significant differences in the activation rates of Fgf3 and Fgf8 depending upon the status of Wnt1 expression in the mammary gland. The differential activation of these Fgfs may relate to differences in their signaling pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2334425364,"The oncogene v-rel of Reticuloendotheliosis virus, strain T, is derived from an avian c-rel proto-oncogene. c-rel encodes a member of the Rel/NF-κB family of transcription factors. The highly oncogenic v-Rel differs from c-Rel which has low transforming potential by the acquisition of numerous mutations. In this manuscript, we demonstrate that the oncogenic mutations in v-Rel directly alter the ability of this protein to bind to DNA. Electrophoretic mobility shift analysis with Rel proteins synthesized in vitro as well as isolated from nuclei of Rel expressing cells showed that three mutation clusters, present in the N-terminus, the center and the C-terminus of v-Rel, altered three different aspects of DNA binding. In contrast, the oncogenic C-terminal deletion of 118 amino acids present in v-Rel had almost no influence on its DNA binding. The N-terminal mutation cluster altered the κB DNA-binding specificity of the v-Rel oncoprotein relative to c-Rel. The mutation Met-20→Thr was found to be principally responsible for this alteration. The second mutation cluster was responsible for increased binding of v-Rel to all the κB sites examined presumably because it stabilized v-Rel homodimers. This alteration in DNA binding was mapped to the group of two mutations within the cluster. In contrast, the third mutation cluster in the C-terminus of v-Rel destabilized the binding of v-Rel to all of the κB sites examined. This is the first indication that regions outside the Rel Homology Region can participate in the control of binding of the c-Rel protein to DNA. The three mutation clusters examined contributed to the tumorigenic potential of v-Rel with the relative strength decreasing with their position from the N-terminus to the C-terminus. These results suggest that the oncogenic mutations in v-Rel cooperate and enable v-Rel to form nuclear complexes with aberrant DNA-binding properties that may directly alter gene expression and DNA replication resulting in the transformation of the cell."

https://openalex.org/W2057036002,"Insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) and Shc are two proteins implicated in intracellular signal transduction. They are activated by an increasing number of extracellular signals, mediated by receptor tyrosine kinases, cytokine receptors, and G protein-coupled receptors. In this study we demonstrate that Shc interacts directly with IRS-1, using the yeast two-hybrid system and an in vitrointeraction assay. Deletion analysis of the proteins to map the domains implicated in this interaction shows that the phosphotyrosine binding domain of Shc binds to the region of IRS-1 comprising amino acids 583–661. An in vitro association assay, performed with or without activation of tyrosine kinases, gives evidence that tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 and Shc drastically improves the interaction. Site-directed mutagenesis on IRS-1 583–693 shows that the asparagine, but not the tyrosine residue of the N625GDY628motif domain, is implicated in the IRS-1-Shc-phosphotyrosine binding interaction. Mutation of another tyrosine residue, Tyr608, also induced a 40% decrease in the interaction. This study, describing a phosphotyrosine-dependent interaction between IRS-1 and Shc, suggests that this association might be important in signal transduction. Insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) and Shc are two proteins implicated in intracellular signal transduction.

This study, describing a phosphotyrosine-dependent interaction between IRS-1 and Shc, suggests that this association might be important in signal transduction. Intracellular signal transduction by growth factors involves a cascade of phosphorylation and dephosphorylation events, beginning by the autophosphorylation and activation of a receptor tyrosine kinase. Among the cohort of intracellular proteins activated by growth factors, two families of proteins, IRSs 1The abbreviations used are: IRS, insulin receptor substrate; SH2 domain, Src homology 2 domain; PTB domain, phosphotyrosine binding domain; IR, insulin receptor; GST, glutathioneS-transferase; Gal4 BD, Gal4 binding domain; Gal4 AD, Gal4 activation domain; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; CH1, collagen homologous region; PIPES, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid. 1The abbreviations used are: IRS, insulin receptor substrate; SH2 domain, Src homology 2 domain; PTB domain, phosphotyrosine binding domain; IR, insulin receptor; GST, glutathioneS-transferase; Gal4 BD, Gal4 binding domain; Gal4 AD, Gal4 activation domain; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; CH1, collagen homologous region; PIPES, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid. and Shc, are of particular interest. Shc proteins are molecular adaptors characterized by the presence of different interaction domains: two phosphotyrosine interaction domains, a C terminus SH2 domain and an N terminus PTB domain, allowing interaction with receptor tyrosine kinases, and a central collagen homologous (CH1) region (1Pelicci G.

Shc is known to be implicated in the activation of the Ras signaling pathway via the association of the adaptor Grb2 with phosphotyrosine residues of the CH1 region (4Rozakis-Adcock M. McGlade J.

However the CH1 region can also bind other proteins, like adaptins or Src homology 3 domain-containing proteins (5Okabayashi Y. Sugimoto Y. Totty N.F. Hsuan J. Kido Y. Sakaguchi K. Gout Y.

This implies that in addition to the activation of the Ras pathway, Shc-related proteins can be involved in other cellular functions (7Bonfini L. Migliaccio E. Pelicci G. Lanfrancone L. Pelicci P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 257-261Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). IRS proteins IRS-1 and IRS-2 are considered to be docking proteins; their multiple tyrosine phosphorylated residues are potential binding sites for SH2-containing proteins, initiating various signaling pathways (8Myers Jr., M.J.

Trends Cell Biol. 1996; 6: 1-4Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Different classes of factors are known to bind to IRSs: molecular adaptors, like Grb2 and Nck, and proteins with catalytic activity, like the tyrosine phosphatase Syp, the tyrosine kinase p59 fyn, or the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase via its p85 regulatory subunit (8Myers Jr., M.J.

In support of this hypothesis, it can be noticed that SH2 containing proteins like Grb2, Nck, p85, and Syp can either bind directly to activated growth factor tyrosine kinase receptors or bind to the docking protein IRS-1 (10Sun X.J.

This result has not been confirmed by further studies, probably due to the low ability of Shc to coprecipitate with relevant proteins, like the insulin receptor. Indeed, an association between the insulin receptor and Shc, or the insulin receptor and IRS-2, has never been reported in cells, using co-immunoprecipitation assays (17Skolnik E.Y. Lee C.-H.

The aim of the present study was then to further analyze the interaction between Shc and IRS-1, using two sensitive systems that allow the detection of transient or weak protein-protein interactions: the yeast two-hybrid system and an association assay between GST fusions and in vitro translated proteins. This study shows a direct interaction between the two proteins IRS-1 and Shc and delineates the minimal interaction domains of these proteins. These experiments demonstrate also that the IRS-1-Shc interaction is phosphorylation-dependent, suggesting that it plays a role in growth factor signaling.

Yeast expression plasmids pAS1-CYH2 (pAS2) and pACTII were provided by S. Elledge (Houston, TX) (23Durfee T. Becherer K. Chen P.H. Yeh S.H. Yang Y. Kilburn A.E. Lee W.H. Elledge S.J.

Cell. 1993; 75: 805-816Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5220) Google Scholar), and pGBT9 was provided by S. Fields (New York, NY). pAS2 and pGBT9 contain Gal4 DNA binding domain (Gal4BD) and were used with the yeast strains Y190 and Y526 containing lacZ gene downstream the Gal4 binding sequence. pACTII contains the Gal4 activation domain (Gal4 AD). Rat IRS-1 and IR cDNAs were kindly provided by M. F. White and C. R. Kahn. Human Shc p52 and IR cDNAs were gifts from P. G. Pelicci and E. Clauser, respectively. Synthetic defined dropout yeast (DO) media lacking the appropriate amino acids were obtained from BIO 101 (La Jolla, CA). Oligonucleotides were purchased at the Institut Pasteur (Paris, France). All chemicals were from Sigma France, and enzymes were from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). Several subdomains of IRS-1 cDNA were generated by restriction digestion: IRS-1 215–1231 (XmnI) and IRS-1 583–693 (XbaI/NcoI). Other subdomains, IRS-1 215–583, IRS-1 583–661, and IRS-1 633–693, were generated by polymerase chain reaction using pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), introducing a BamHI site to each end of the cDNA fragment to allow the in-frame insertion into pAS2. Site-directed mutagenesis was made in the pAS2 IRS-1 583–693 construct, using the Quick Change site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Single mutations were tyrosine 608 changed into alanine (Y608A), tyrosine 628 changed into phenylalanine (Y628F), tyrosine 658 changed into alanine (Y658A), and asparagine 625 changed into alanine (N625A). Double mutants were Y608A/N625A, N625A/Y628F, and Y608A/Y628F. For pBSSK IRS-1, pBSSK IRS-1 1–708, and pBSSK IRS-1 691–1231 constructs, cDNA fragments were generated by polymerase chain reaction. The BglI/DraI fragment of the rat IR cDNA, corresponding to the intracellular domain of the β-subunit, was inserted in pGBT9. Shc constructs (Shc 1–473, Shc 1–230, Shc 234–473) cloned into pACTII were previously described (20Tartare-Deckert S. Sawka-Verhelle D. Murdaca J. Van Obberghen E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23456-23460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Shc 1–473, Shc 1–230, and the intracellular domain of the human IR were generated by polymerase chain reaction and cloned into the pGEX 3X (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). All constructs were verified by DNA sequence analysis. Yeast strains were transformed by the lithium acetate method of Gietz (25Gietz D. St Jean A. Woods R.A. Schiestl R.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1425-1426Crossref PubMed Scopus (2883) Google Scholar). Cotransformants were selected on plates lacking tryptophan and leucine (DO-WL) to select for the presence of pAS2 or pGBT9 and pACTII, respectively. Three colonies of each cotransformant were patched on DO-WL plates and then replicated on Whatman No. 40 paper, laid on a DO-WL plate. After 24 h, a β-galactosidase assay was performed by a color filter assay using 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside as described (26Bartel P.L. Chien C.T. Sternglanz R. Fields S. Hartley D.A. Cellular interactions in Development: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, Oxford1993: 153-179Google Scholar). The blue coloration of patches reflects the occurrence of interaction between the two hybrid proteins. For quantitative studies of β-galactosidase activity, a solution assay was performed on eight independent colonies from two independent transformation experiments. Yeast were grown in DO-WL galactose medium, and substrate was O-nitrophenyl β-d-galactopyranoside (26Bartel P.L. Chien C.T. Sternglanz R. Fields S. Hartley D.A. Cellular interactions in Development: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, Oxford1993: 153-179Google Scholar). Yeast protein extracts were performed with glass beads according to the manufacturer's protocol (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA). Extracts were subjected to SDS-PAGE, and proteins were blotted to nitrocellulose. Hybrid proteins were detected using anti-Gal4 AD and anti-Gal4 BD antibodies (CLONTECH), and the ECL detection kit (Amersham). GST, GST-Shc, GST-Shc 1–230, and GST-IR were produced in bacteria according to the manufacturer's protocol (Pharmacia). Induced bacteria were lysed by sonication in PLC lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 100 mm NaF, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Clarified lysates were incubated with glutathione-Sepharose beads for 1 h at 4 °C in PLC lysis buffer. Beads were then washed three times with HNTG buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). IRS-1 1–1231, IRS-1 1–708, and IRS-1 691–1231 were transcribed and translated in vitro using [35S]methionine and the TNT-coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega, Madison, WI). A 15-μl aliquot of the translation mix was added to 1 μg of immobilized GST and GST fusion proteins. To allow tyrosine phosphorylation, the proteins were preincubated with PIPES buffer (20 mm PIPES, pH 7.0, 10 mm MnCl2, 0.1 mm sodium vanadate, 10 μg/ml aprotinin) at 30 °C for 30 min to activate the reticulocyte lysate tyrosine kinases as described in Ref. 27Keegan K. Cooper J.A. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1537-1544PubMed Google Scholar. 1 ml of Nonidet P-40/deoxycholate RIPA buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% deoxycholate, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mmNaF, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm pepstatin A) was added, and binding was allowed to occur at 4 °C for 1 h. Beads were washed three times with 1 ml of Nonidet P-40/deoxycholate RIPA buffer, and bound proteins were eluted by boiling in SDS sample buffer. The resulting proteins were electrophoresed on 10% SDS-PAGE, and bound translation products were detected by autoradiography. An interaction was observed between the two proteins IRS-1 and Shc using two techniques. In the two-hybrid system, IRS-1 215–1231 fused to the Gal4 BD was shown to interact with full-length Shc fused to Gal4 AD (Fig.1 A). As assessed by the quantitative β-galactosidase assay, this interaction was of the same order of magnitude as the interactions between the insulin receptor and Shc (19Gustafson T.A. He W. Craparo A.

Nature. 1989; 340: 245-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (4838) Google Scholar), measured in the same experiment (Fig.1 A). An in vitro association experiment was performed using immobilized GST fusion proteins and in vitrotranslated IRS-1 labeled with [35S]methionine. As shown in Fig. 1 B, IRS-1 was not retained by GST but was retained by GST-Shc and by GST-IR used as a positive control. These results give clear evidence that the two proteins IRS-1 and Shc can associate. To determine the domains of the two proteins implicated in the interaction, we have generated a series of deletion mutants of Gal4 BD-IRS-1 and Gal4 AD-Shc fusion proteins (Fig. 2). The expression of the different hybrid proteins was verified on Western blot, as shown on Fig. 2. It can be noticed that the Shc 234–473 has a faster migration mobility than what could be expected given its size, in comparison with Shc 1–230. The explanation for this difference remains unclear but could be due to differences in the amino acid composition of the two proteins. The expression of the reporter genelacZ was tested for each cotransformant studied (TableI). The interaction between IRS-1 and Shc was observed with the PTB domain of Shc (Shc 1–230) but not with the CH-SH2 domain (Shc 234–473). The minimal domain of IRS-1 able to interact with Shc in this system was the fragment containing the amino acids 583–661. The other domains either did not interact (IRS-1 215–583) or could not be tested in the two-hybrid system due to an important background (IRS-1 693–1231).Table ICharacterization of the interaction between IRS-1 and ShcGal4 BD fusionGal4 AD fusionShcShc 1–230Shc 234–473SNF4IRS-1 215–1231+++−−IRS-1 215–583−−−−IRS-1 583–693++++−−IRS-1 583–661++++−−IRS-1 633–693−+/−−−p53−−−The yeast strain Y190 was cotransformed with different combinations of pAS2 plasmid encoding the IRS-1 domains in fusion with Gal4 BD and pACTII plasmid encoding the Shc domains in fusion with Gal4 AD.

Open table in a new tab The yeast strain Y190 was cotransformed with different combinations of pAS2 plasmid encoding the IRS-1 domains in fusion with Gal4 BD and pACTII plasmid encoding the Shc domains in fusion with Gal4 AD.

IRS-1 and Shc fusion proteins expressed in yeast display a low tyrosine phosphorylation, as detected in Western blot using an antiphosphotyrosine antibody (data not shown). To determine the importance of the phosphorylation state of the proteins for the interaction observed, we have tested in vitro association of IRS-1 and Shc, stimulating or not stimulating the activity of tyrosine kinases present in the reticulocyte lysate (27Keegan K. Cooper J.A. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1537-1544PubMed Google Scholar). Full-length IRS-1, IRS-1 1–708, and IRS-1 691–1231 were transcribed and translatedin vitro in presence of [35S]methionine. The radioactive translation products were incubated with GST fusions. This incubation was performed with or without prior phosphorylation of the two proteins, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The phosphorylation state of the proteins was verified by antiphosphotyrosine Western blot (data not shown). Identical amounts of the various GST fusions were used, as assessed by Coomassie Blue staining of the gels before autoradiography (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 3 A, IRS-1 binds to GST-Shc and GST-Shc 1–230 and also to GST-IR in absence of induction of phosphorylation (lanes 3–5). However, a stronger interaction was observed when both partners were phosphorylated, as assessed by the amount of labeled IRS-1 detected on the gel (lanes 7–9). This experiment suggests that the IRS-1-Shc interaction, like the IR-IRS-1 interaction, is phosphorylation-dependent. Such an interaction with GST-Shc and GST-Shc 1–230 was also observed with the N-terminal domain but not with the C-terminal domain of IRS-1 (Fig. 3 B). These results show that the N-terminal domain of IRS-1 and not the C-terminal domain can associate with the Shc PTB domain in a phosphotyrosine-dependent manner. We have mutated the three tyrosine residues present in IRS-1 583–661 to determine their relative importance in the IRS-1-Shc interaction (Fig.4 A). Remarkably, Tyr628 is in a NGDY motif, resembling the NPXY motif recognized by PTB domains (2Kavanaugh W.M. Williams L.T. Science. 1994; 266: 1862-1865Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar, 3Blaikie P. Immanuel D. Wu J. Li N. Yajnik V. Margolis B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32031-32034Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The proline residue of the binding consensus sequence is not conserved in the IRS-1 583–693 domain, but it has been shown that it is not critical for the PTB interaction (29Songyang Z. Margolis B. Chaudhuri M. Shoelson S.E. Cantley L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14863-14866Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 30Laminet A.A. Apell G. Conroy L. Kavanaugh W.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 264-269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In addition, all three tyrosine residues are into a YMXM motif. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed on the Gal4 BD IRS-1 583–693 domain. We have generated four single mutants: Y608A, Y628F, Y658A, and N625A, and three double mutants: Y608A/N625A, N625A/Y628F, and Y608A/Y628F. Their expression was confirmed by Western blot (result not shown). The interaction between IRS-1 mutants and Shc 1–230 was quantified by a β-galactosidase solution assay, and results were expressed as a percentage of the maximum interaction measured with wild type IRS-1 583–693 (70 ± 8 units of Miller), as shown in Fig.4 B. IRS-1-Shc interaction was significantly decreased (by 40%) by mutation of Tyr608 but not altered by mutation of Tyr658. Surprisingly, in the NGDY motif, mutation of Tyr628 was without effect, whereas mutation of Asn625 induced a significant alteration of the interaction. In addition, combination of two mutations did not further decrease the modification induced by a single mutation, even for the Y608A/N625A double mutant. These results show that although they are not the only ones, Tyr608 and Asn625 are important residues for the interaction between IRS-1 and Shc. In the present study we have shown an interaction between the PTB domain of Shc and a 78-amino acid-long domain of IRS-1. This interaction was demonstrated using two different methods: the yeast two-hybrid system and an in vitro association assay. It is thus likely that the IRS-1-Shc interaction is a direct interaction. If another protein was to be implicated in this association, it should have been present in adequate amounts in both the yeast nucleus and the rabbit reticulocyte lysate. We show that the PTB domain of Shc and not the SH2 domain is implicated in the association with IRS-1. Then, IRS-1, known to recruit proteins through their SH2 domain, can also bind other factors using a different recognition system. Shc is now considered to be an adaptor protein, with a modular organization (for review see Ref. 7Bonfini L. Migliaccio E. Pelicci G. Lanfrancone L. Pelicci P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 257-261Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). The identification of proteins able to bind the different domains of Shc are important to shed light on the other roles that Shc might play in addition to Ras activation. PTB domains were first defined as specialized domains interacting with a tyrosine residue in a NPXpY motif (2Kavanaugh W.M. Williams L.T. Science. 1994; 266: 1862-1865Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar, 3Blaikie P. Immanuel D. Wu J. Li N. Yajnik V. Margolis B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32031-32034Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, recent studies have shown that the binding motif recognized by a PTB domain cannot be restricted to the NPXY motif. For example, the interaction between βAPP and the PTB domains of X11 and FE65 is mediated by the YENPTY motif of βAPP (31Borg J.-P. Ooi J. Levy E. Margolis B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6229-6241Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). Mutation of the first tyrosine residue of this motif suppresses both interactions, whereas mutation of the last tyrosine residue has no effect. Furthermore, mutation of the asparagine residue (N) specifically alters the interaction with X11 and not with FE65 (31Borg J.-P. Ooi J. Levy E. Margolis B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6229-6241Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). Similarly, in the present study, IRS-1-Shc interaction is significantly altered by mutation of the first tyrosine and the asparagine residues of the Y(X)16NGDY motif of IRS-1 583–661, but is unaffected by mutation of the last tyrosine residue of this motif. The minimum domain of IRS-1 interacting with Shc, IRS-1 583–661, includes the tyrosine residue Tyr608, which is implicated in the interaction, as shown by mutagenesis experiments. Tyr608 has already been described as binding site for the p85 subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (10Sun X.J. Crimmins D.L. Myers Jr., M.G. Miralpeix M. White M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7418-7428Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, p85 and Shc might compete for the same binding site. A competition for binding to the same residue of IRS-1 has already been described; Tyr895 can bind either Grb2 or p59 fyn (32Sun X.J. Pons S. Asano T. Myers Jr., M.G. Glasheen E. White M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10583-10587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). This suggests that IRS-1 signaling complexes are not homogenous and that different elements in the complex may influence the signal (32Sun X.J. Pons S. Asano T. Myers Jr., M.G. Glasheen E. White M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10583-10587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). IRS-1 583–661 is also included in the corresponding domain of IRS-2 that mediates an interaction with the insulin receptor (21Sawka-Verhelle D. Tartare-Deckert S. White M.F. Van Obberghen E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5980-5983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 22He W. Craparo A. Zhu Y. O'Neill T.J. Wang L.-M. Pierce J.H. Gustafson T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11641-11645Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). It should be interesting to know if the PTB domain of Shc is also able to bind to IRS-2. In the in vitro association assay, in absence of stimulation of tyrosine phosphorylation, we can observe a basal interaction between IRS-1 and Shc and also between IRS-1 and the insulin receptor. Knowing that IR-IRS-1 interaction is dependent on tyrosine phosphorylation, the meaning of this basal association is unclear (no basal tyrosine phosphorylation was detectable on Western blot in these conditions; data not shown). On the other hand, mutations of the tyrosine residues of the IRS-1 583–693 domain decrease but never suppress the interaction with Shc, which suggests a phosphotyrosine-independent component in this interaction. Supporting this, it has recently been shown that PTB domains can bind to nonphosphorylated proteins (31Borg J.-P. Ooi J. Levy E. Margolis B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6229-6241Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar,33Charest A. Wagner J. Jacob S. McGlade C.J. Tremblay M.L. J. Biol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 4640-4645Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). On the other hand, an IRS-1 molecule in which 18 potential tyrosine phosphorylation sites were replaced by phenylalanine, failed to undergo tyrosine phosphorylation or mediate activation of some effectors but retained the ability to stimulate insulin-mediated mitogenesis at high insulin concentration (36Myers Jr., M.G. Zhang Y. Aldaz G.A.I. Grammer T. Glasheen E.M. Yenush L. Wang L.M. Sun X.S. Blenis J. Pierce J.H. White M.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4147-4155Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). This suggests that IRS-1 contains phosphotyrosine-independent elements that are involved in mitogenic signals, potentially the phosphotyrosine-independent component of the interaction of Shc with IRS-1. Tyrosine phosphorylation drastically improves the IRS-1-Shc association, to the same extend as the IR-Shc association used as control, suggesting that the IRS-1-Shc interaction is implicated in growth factor signal transduction. Furthermore, mutation of Tyr608 of IRS-1 583–693 significantly altered the IRS-1-Shc interaction. However, there is a discrepancy between the partial decrease induced by the tyrosine mutations on IRS-1 583–693, and the striking stimulatory effect of tyrosine phosphorylation on thein vitro interaction. One explanation could be that tyrosine residues located outside of IRS-1 583–693 could also be implicated in the phosphotyrosine-dependent interaction observed in vitro with a larger N-terminal domain. In addition, tyrosine phosphorylation occurring in yeast might be insufficient to induce interactions similar to those observed after tyrosine kinase stimulation in vitro. Recently, structural studies of Shc and IRS-1 PTB domains have revealed that they are members of the pleckstrin homology domain family (37Zhou M.-M. Ravichandran K.S. Olejniczak E.T. Petros A.M. Meadows R.P. Harlan J.E. Wade W.S. Burakoff S.J. Fesik S.W. Nature. 1995; 378: 584-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar,38Eck M.J. Dhe-Paganon S. Trüb T. Nolte R.T. Shoelson S.E. Cell. 1996; 85: 695-705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Pleckstrin homology domains are found in a large variety of proteins, and they are likely to be involved in the localization of proteins in the membrane proximity (for review see Ref. 39Lemmon M.A. Ferguson K.M. Schlessinger J. Cell. 1996; 85: 621-624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). Intracellular localization of the proteins implicated in signal transduction is likely to be important for their recruitment after receptor stimulation. For example, it has been shown that distinct pools of Grb2-Sos are recruited after epidermal growth factor or insulin stimulation (40Waters S.B. Chen D. Kao A.W. Okada S. Holt K.H. Pessin J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18224-18230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Shc proteins are located in the central perinuclear area in unstimulated cells and are redistributed to the peripheral cytosol upon growth factor stimulation (41Lotti L.V. Lanfrancone L. Migliaccio C. Zompetta C. Pelicci G. Salcini A.E. Falini B. Pelicci P.G. Torrisi M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1946-1954Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). It is possible that IRS-1 and Shc could be located in subcellular pools allowing or not allowing their interaction, depending on the activation state of the cell. However, IRS-1-Shc interaction could also allow the localization of the two factors in the same cell compartment. In summary, we have shown that IRS-1 and Shc interact in vitro and in the yeast two-hybrid system. This association is dependent on tyrosine phosphorylation and thus might be important in intracellular signal transduction. The docking protein IRS-1 is known to interact with an increasing number of factors through their SH2 domains. The present work is the first report of the binding of an adaptor on IRS-1 using a non-SH2 domain. The recruitment of different sets of factors and the formation of various signaling complexes may be a mechanism to induce specific signals. Considering this, the interaction of Shc with IRS-1 could add some degree of specificity in the signal transduced by insulin and growth factors receptors. We thank M. F. White and C. R.

https://openalex.org/W2322086909,"p94fer is a ubiquitous, nuclear and cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase, whose accumulation has been demonstrated in all mammalian cell lines analysed. In the present work, the p94fer expression profile was determined in cell lines which were not tested before. While being present in several hematopoietic and non hematopoietic cell lines including thymic stromal cells, the p94fer kinase could not be detected in pre-T and T cell lines. p94fer was also absent in pre-B line, but accumulated in these cells upon their induced development to antibody producing cells. This is in agreement with the absence of p94fer in primary thymic and splenic T lymphocytes and its induced accumulation in stimulated B cells. Relatively high p94fer levels were detected in primary thymic and splenic stromal cells. Ectopic expression of p94fer in pre-T cells slightly affected their cell cycle profile but it did not affect their apoptotic death which was induced by ionizing radiation. However, p94fer facilitated dramatically, the cellular recovery of gamma irradiated pre-T cells which have escaped the apoptotic death. The enhanced recovery of the irradiated, p94fer expressing pre-T cells, resulted most probably from their increased survival, rather than from a prominent change in their proliferation rate. The absence of p94fer from pre-B and pre-T cells, may thus contribute to the relative sensitivity of these cells to ionizing radiation and to their dependence on the functioning of other nuclear tyrosine kinasese."
https://openalex.org/W2170093866,"The lymphotoxin-β receptor (LT-βR) has been shown to be the receptor for the membrane-bound lymphotoxin heterotrimers LTα1/β2 and LTα2/β1. The extracellular domain of LT-βR shows extensive similarity with members of the tumor necrosis factor receptor family, while its cytoplasmic domain is distinct and lacks any inherent enzymatic activity. This suggests that the interaction of LT-βR with other molecules might be important for signal transduction. Here we demonstrate the association of a fusion protein, comprising glutathione S-transferase and the cytoplasmic domain of LT-βR (GST-LT-βR(CD)), with several proteins in the size range 29–80 kDa from HepG2 cell lysates. We present evidence that two of these proteins are serine/threonine kinases, which associate with amino acids 324–377 of the cytoplasmic domain of LT-βR and phosphorylate this receptor. The characteristics of these novel kinases indicate that they are distinct from the previously described tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated kinases. This suggests the presence of novel signal transduction pathway(s) for LT-βR. The lymphotoxin-β receptor (LT-βR) has been shown to be the receptor for the membrane-bound lymphotoxin heterotrimers LTα1/β2 and LTα2/β1. The extracellular domain of LT-βR shows extensive similarity with members of the tumor necrosis factor receptor family, while its cytoplasmic domain is distinct and lacks any inherent enzymatic activity. This suggests that the interaction of LT-βR with other molecules might be important for signal transduction. Here we demonstrate the association of a fusion protein, comprising glutathione S-transferase and the cytoplasmic domain of LT-βR (GST-LT-βR(CD)), with several proteins in the size range 29–80 kDa from HepG2 cell lysates. We present evidence that two of these proteins are serine/threonine kinases, which associate with amino acids 324–377 of the cytoplasmic domain of LT-βR and phosphorylate this receptor. The characteristics of these novel kinases indicate that they are distinct from the previously described tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated kinases. This suggests the presence of novel signal transduction pathway(s) for LT-βR.

Two structurally-related molecules, TNFα and lymphotoxin (LT)α (also known as TNFβ), are encoded by two genes located just 1 kilobase apart in the class III region of the human major histocompatibility complex (3Browning J.L. Ngam E.A. Lawton P. DeMarinis J. Tizard R. Chow E.P. Hession C. O'Brine G.B. Foley S.F. Ware C.F. Cell. 1993; 72: 847-856Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). Both TNFα and LTα can bind to tumor necrosis factor receptors type I and type II (TNFRI and TNFRII) to mediate similar biological effects. Recently, a member of the TNF/LT family known as LTβ, which is encoded by a gene lying 4 kilobases centromeric to the TNFα/LTα genes, was found to be expressed on the surface of natural killer (NK) cells, lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cells, and activated T and B lymphocytes (3Browning J.L.

In contrast to the homotrimeric structures of TNFα (which occurs as membrane-bound and secreted forms) and LTα (which is secreted), LTβ is a 33-kDa transmembrane protein, which associates with LTα and anchors it to the cell surface. Stoichiometrically, membrane lymphotoxin is a heterotrimer and is composed of either LTα1/LTβ2 (major form) or LTα2/LTβ1 (minor form) (6Browning J.L. Dougas I. Ngam E.A. Bourdon P.R. Ehrenfels B.N.

The LTα2/LTβ1 heterotrimer has been shown to bind to TNFRI, TNFRII, and LT-βR, while the LTα1/LTβ2 heterotrimer binds only to LT-βR (also known as TNFRIII, or TNFR-related protein (TNFRrp)) (6Browning J.L.

In contrast to TNFRI and TNFRII, the functions of LT-βR are still not well understood. In LTα knock-out mice, which lack the membrane form of lymphotoxin, normal development of peripheral lymph nodes is ablated (9De T.P. Goellner J. Ruddle N.H. Streeter P.R. Fick A. Mariathasan S.

Since this phenotype is not observed in either TNFRI or TNFRII knock-out mice (11Pfeffer K. Matsuyama T. Kundig T.M. Wakeham A. Kishihara K. Shahinian A. Wiegmann K. Ohashi P.S. Kronke M. Mak T.W.

Furthermore, stimulation of LT-βR by immobilized anti-LT-βR monoclonal antibodies has been shown to trigger activation of NF-κB in HT-29 (human adenocarcinoma) and WI38 (human lung fibroblast) cells (14Mackay F. Majeau G.R. Hochman P.S. Browning J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24934-24938Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) and signaling through LT-βR in conjunction with interferon-γ can induce cell death through apoptosis in some adenocarcinoma cell lines (15Browning J.L. Miatkowski K. Sizing I. Griffiths D. Zafari M. Benjamin C.D. Meier W. Mackay F. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 867-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). These studies provide evidence that LT-βR can transduce signals that trigger both cell proliferation and apoptosis. The cytoplasmic domain of LT-βR, like other members of the TNF receptor family, does not contain consensus sequences characteristic of known kinases or any motifs associated with signal transduction. Therefore, kinases or other proteins associated with the cytoplasmic domain of LT-βR are likely to be involved in the signal transduction pathway. Recently, two members of the TNF receptor-associated factor (TRAF) family, TRAF3 and TRAF5, were found to associate with LT-βR (16Mosialos G. Birkenbach M. Yalamanchili R. VanArsdale T. Ware C. Kieff E. Cell. 1995; 389: 389-399Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (906) Google Scholar, 17Nakano H. Oshima H. Chung W. Williams-Abbott L. Ware C.F. Yagita H. Okumura K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14661-14664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). There is evidence that TRAF5 is involved in the activation of NF-κB (17Nakano H. Oshima H. Chung W. Williams-Abbott L. Ware C.F. Yagita H. Okumura K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14661-14664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar), but the role of TRAF3 in the LT-βR signaling pathway has not been reported. While members of the Janus kinase (JAK) family have been shown to play a key role in signal transduction via many cytokine receptors (18Miyajima A. Kitamura T. Harada N. Yokota T. Arai K.-I. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1992; 10: 295-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar, 19Taniguchi T. Science. 1995; 268: 251-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar, 20Ihle J.N. Nature. 1995; 377: 591-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (1145) Google Scholar), the nature of the kinases involved in the signal transduction pathways of the TNF receptor family has only recently been investigated. Several groups have shown that the cytoplasmic domains of both TNFRI and TNFRII can associate with serine/threonine kinases. Darnay et al.(21Darnay B.G. Reddy S.A. Aggarwal B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20299-20304Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Darnay B.G. Reddy S.A. Aggarwal B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19687-19690Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have identified serine/threonine kinases that specifically associate with fusion proteins comprising glutathioneS-transferase and the cytoplasmic domain of TNFRI (GST-p60) and TNFRII (GST-p80). Furthermore, the TNFRI-associated kinase (p60-TRAK) was shown to bind residues 344–397 of the TNFRI cytoplasmic domain (death domain) and to be involved in TNF-induced signaling (23Darnay B.G. Singh S. Chaturvedi M.M. Aggarwal B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14867-14870Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The TNFRI-associated kinase activity was also demonstrated in immunoprecipitates from U937 cell lysates using an anti-TNFRI antibody (24VanArsdale T.L. Ware C.F. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 3043-3050PubMed Google Scholar). Another TNFRI-associated protein, RIP, has been shown to be a serine/threonine kinase, which contains a kinase domain in its N terminus and a death domain in its C terminus. The TNF-dependent recruitment of RIP to the TNFRI signal complex is mediated by a TNFRI-associated death domain-containing protein (TRADD) and has been shown to induce apoptosis and NF-κB activation following receptor triggering (25Hsu H. Huang J. Shu H.B. Baichwal V. Goeddel D.V. Immunity. 1996; 4: 387-396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (983) Google Scholar). However, it is unclear whether or not RIP can phosphorylate TNFRI. The TNFRII-associated kinase has been identified as casein kinase-1 (CK-1) (26Beyaert R. Vanhaesebroeck B. Declercq W. Van Lint J. Vandenabeele P. Agostinis P. Vandenheede J.R. Fiers W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23293-23299Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) and CKI-7, an inhibitor of CK-1, has been shown to inhibit the phosphorylation of TNFRII and to potentiate TNF-induced apoptosis. This evidence suggests that CK-1 is involved in signal transduction through TNFRII. Based on the information above, we wished to determine whether LT-βR is associated with kinase activity. Here we report the identification of two serine/threonine kinases specifically associated with LT-βR and demonstrate that these can phosphorylate LT-βR, but not TNFRI. These novel kinases are likely to be important in LT-βR signal transduction pathway(s). Mammalian cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, in a 37 °C incubator containing 5% (v/v) CO2. For radioisotope labeling, cells were washed twice with Hank's balanced salt solution (8 g/liter NaCl, 0.4 g/liter KCl, 0.2 g/liter MgSO4·7H2O, 60 mg/liter Na2HPO4, 60 mg/liter KH2PO4, 1 g/liter glucose, 140 mg/liter CaCl2), then incubated in cysteine/methionine-free medium containing 10% (v/v) dialyzed fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.) for 1 h, followed by addition of 50 μCi/ml [35S]cysteine/methionine (NEN Research Products) and incubation at 37 °C for 6 h before harvesting. To construct pGST-LT-βR(CD), a 540-base pair PstI/HindIII cDNA fragment (nucleotides 767–1305) encoding almost the full length of the human LT-βR cytoplasmic domain was amplified by reverse transcription-PCR using a HepG2-derived cDNA template and the primers 5′-CGGGATCCATGCTCCTGCCTTGGGCCAC-3′ (sense) and 5′-GCGGATCCTGGGGGCAGTGGCCTAATGG-3′ (antisense). The PCR product was end-filled, cloned into SmaI-cut pGEX-2T vector, and sequenced to confirm that the pGST-LT-βR(CD) construct contained no deleterious PCR errors. Deletion mutants were generated by restriction enzyme digestion and subsequent religation of pGST-LT-βR(CD). The expression and purification of GST-fusion proteins were carried out as described by Darnay et al. (21Darnay B.G. Reddy S.A. Aggarwal B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20299-20304Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with the following modifications. JM109 bacteria containing the pGST-LT-βR(CD) were grown to A 600 = 0.2 at 37 °C before adding isopopyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to 0.1 μm. After 3 h of induction, bacteria were lysed with buffer A (20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 200 mm NaCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml aprotonin, 0.1% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.5% (v/v) Nonidet P-40) containing 100 μg/ml lysozyme. After brief sonication, the bacterial lysate was centrifuged at 3500 ×g, for 5 min at 4 °C to remove insoluble debris. The supernatant was incubated with 50% (v/v) glutathione-agarose beads (Sigma) at 4 °C for 30 min on a rotatory shaker. The slurry was then washed five times with buffer A, and stored as a 50% (v/v) slurry at 4 °C. The in vitro binding assay was modified from that described by Darnay et al. (21Darnay B.G. Reddy S.A. Aggarwal B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20299-20304Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 1 × 107 [35S]cysteine/methionine-labeled HepG2 cells were resuspended in 1 ml of lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.7, 0.5% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 200 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaF, 0.2 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml aprotonin, and 0.1% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol) for 1 h at 4 °C, followed by centrifugation at 9000 × g for 10 min to remove cell debris. Before incubation with the GST-LT-βR(CD) fusion protein, the supernatant was precleared with 15 μg of GST and 50 μl of 50% (v/v) glutathione-agarose beads for 2 h at 4 °C, followed by centrifugation at 800 × g for 3 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was then transferred to a fresh tube and mixed for 2 h with 10 μg of GST-LT-βR(CD) attached to 50 μl of 50% (v/v) glutathione-agarose. Finally, the glutathione-agarose beads were washed six times with lysis buffer. The sample was fractionated by SDS-PAGE (10% (w/v) acrylamide). Gels were dried and analyzed by autoradiography. In vitro kinase assays were carried out as described by Darnay et al. (21Darnay B.G. Reddy S.A. Aggarwal B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20299-20304Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Following incubation with HepG2 cell lysates GST-LT-βR(CD) was incubated with 50 μl of kinase reaction buffer (20 mmHEPES, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mmNaF, 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate) and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP for 10 min at 37 °C, in the presence or absence of Mg2+ or Mn2+. Reactions were stopped by addition of Laemmli's sample buffer. Samples were fractionated by SDS-PAGE (10% (w/v) acrylamide), and proteins were visualized by Coomassie Blue staining. Phosphorylated proteins were identified by autoradiography. In-gel Kinase Assay—The in-gel kinase assay was modified from that developed by Kameshita and Fujisawa (27Kameshita I. Fujisawa H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 183: 139-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). Samples were fractionated on SDS-polyacrylamide gel (10% (w/v) acrylamide) containing GST-LT-βR(CD) fusion protein. The gel was then washed with 20% (v/v) propan-2-ol to remove SDS. The gel was denatured with 6m guanidine HCl, then renatured in 5 mm2-mercaptoethanol, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.04% (v/v) Tween 40. This was followed by washing at 4 °C for 30 min with two changes of buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.2 mmNaF, 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate), and incubation at 22 °C for 3 h in the kinase reaction buffer containing 50 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. After removal of unreacted [γ-32P]ATP, protein kinases were visualized by autoradiography of the dried gel. Signals due to protein kinases were also detected and quantified using a PhosphorImager™ (Molecular Dynamics) to allow comparison of signal strengths. Phosphoamino Acid Analysis—Phosphoamino acid analysis was carried out as described by Guo et al. (28Guo H. Reddy S.A. Damuni Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11193-11198Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Samples were transferred to Immobilon™-P membrane after fractionation by SDS-PAGE (10% (w/v) acrylamide). A strip of membrane containing phospho-GST-LT-βR(CD) was hydrolyzed in 6 n HCl for 90 min at 110 °C, then dried by speed vacuum. After resuspension in H2O, samples were spotted onto Whatman KC2ethyl reverse-phase thin layer chromatography (TLC) plates and then analyzed by ascending TLC in buffer containing 40% (v/v) methanol, 1.5% (v/v) acetic acid, and 0.5% (v/v) formic acid. The migration standards were visualized by ninhydrin staining. To identify and characterize the proteins associated with LT-βR, we fused the cytoplasmic domain of LT-βR with glutathione S-transferase and expressed the GST-LT-βR(CD) fusion protein in Escherichia coli. After purification with glutathione-conjugated agarose beads, a protein migrating at 50 kDa was observed by SDS-PAGE. This corresponds to the predicted molecular mass of the fusion protein. Since HepG2 cells have been shown to contain abundant LT-βR receptors, both by reverse transcription-PCR and immunoprecipitation analysis, 2T. L. Hsu and S. L. Hsieh, manuscript in preparation. the purified GST-LT-βR(CD) fusion protein was incubated with [35S]cysteine/methionine-labeled HepG2 cell lysates to identify proteins that bind to the cytoplasmic domain of LT-βR. After incubation, several proteins with molecular mass values of 75–80, 61, 50, 43, 34, and 29 kDa were found to be associated specifically with GST-LT-βR(CD) (Fig. 1, lane 3), but not with GST under the same conditions (Fig. 1, lane 2) or with GST-LT-βR(CD) in the absence of HepG2 cell lysates (data not shown). To test for the presence of kinase activity in the proteins associated with GST-LT-βR(CD), we carried out an in vitro kinase assay. As shown in Fig. 2, a 50-kDa protein corresponding to the molecular mass of GST-LT-βR(CD) was phosphorylated after incubation with HepG2 cell lysates in the in vitro kinase assay (Fig. 2 B, lane 1). However, there was no evidence that GST was phosphorylated under the same condition (Fig. 2 B, lane 3), nor was the GST-LT-βR(CD) fusion protein phosphorylated in the absence of HepG2 cell lysates (Fig. 2 B, lane 2). This result suggests that the cytoplasmic domain of LT-βR does not have intrinsic kinase activity, but that it might associate with one or more kinases found in HepG2 cell lysates. The smaller phosphorylated proteins (visible in lane 1 of Fig. 2 B) may be phosphoproteins associated with GST-LT-βR(CD), but are more likely to be due to degradation of GST-LT-βR(CD) since the same species were also observed on the SDS-polyacrylamide gel following Coomassie Blue staining (Fig. 2 A). Furthermore, an 80-kDa phosphoprotein (p80) was found to associate with GST-LT-βR(CD) in the in vitro kinase assay (Fig. 2 B, lane 1). Similar results were obtained using lysates from other cell lines expressing LT-βR, including K562, U937, and HeLa (data not shown). The LT-βR-associated kinase activity was found to be optimal in the presence of Mg2+ or Mn2+ (Fig.3 A) and was inhibited by the serine/threonine protein kinase inhibitor staurosporine. In contrast, the kinase activity was not inhibited by calphostin C, which is highly specific inhibitor of protein kinase C. In addition, neither genistein nor tyrophostin A25 inhibited the LT-βR(CD)-associated kinase activity, although both of these reagents have a broad spectrum inhibitory effect on protein tyrosine kinases (Fig. 3 B). Phosphoamino acid analysis showed that serine residues were phosphorylated as were threonine residues, but to a lesser extent (Fig. 3 C). However, there was no incorporation of phosphate into tyrosine residues. These observations provide direct evidence that a serine/threonine kinase activity associates with the cytoplasmic domain of LT-βR. It has been shown that the TNFRII-associated kinase can phosphorylate the cytoplasmic domain of TNFRI, but not vice versa (21Darnay B.G. Reddy S.A. Aggarwal B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20299-20304Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We, therefore, investigated whether the LT-βR-associated kinase could phosphorylate TNFRI, which is abundantly expressed in HepG2 cells (30Totpal K. LaPushin R. Kohno T. Darnay B.G. Aggarwal B.B. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 2248-2257PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.4, A and B, the kinase associated with the GST-LT-βR(CD) deletion mutant Δ6 (amino acids 324–377, Fig. 6) could phosphorylate the 50-kDa wild type GST-LT-βR(CD) (Fig.4, A and B, lane 3), while GST and the 60-kDa GST-TNFRI(CD) fusion protein could not be phosphorylated under the same conditions (Fig. 4, A and B, lanes 1 and 2). The kinase activity associated with GST-LT-βR(CD) was able to phosphorylate other substrates, such as histone H1 and myelin basic protein (MBP), but not casein and bovine serum albumin (Fig. 4, C and 4D).Figure 6Mapping of the kinase association domain of LT-βR. A, the amino acids encoded by the entire cytoplasmic domain of LT-βR (F) and deletion mutants of this domain (Δ1–Δ8) are shown on the left of the figure. The entire cytoplasmic domain of LT-βR and the deletion mutants were expressed as fusion proteins linked to GST, then incubated with HepG2 cell lysates. This was followed by in vitrokinase assays. Proteins fractionated by SDS-PAGE (10% (w/v) acrylamide) were detected by Coomassie Blue staining (B) and autoradiography (C).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To further characterize the kinase activity associated with LT-βR, an in-gel kinase assay was performed. With GST-LT-βR(CD) as substrate, two signals of 50 and 80 kDa (Fig.5 A, lane 4) were observed, corresponding to proteins specifically associated with LT-βR, while a third protein of 82 kDa was also found to associate with both GST (Fig.5 A, lane 3) and GST-LT-βR(CD) (Fig.5 A, lane 4). This result demonstrates the presence of two kinases, p50 and p80, specifically associated with LT-βR. To determine whether these two kinases are able to autophosphorylate, the same experiment was carried out in the absence of substrate in the gel. A similar result was observed, but the signals detected were less than one-tenth of the strength of those seen when GST-LT-βR(CD) was present in the gel (Fig. 5 B). Based on the observations above, it is clear that both p50 and p80 are LT-βR(CD)-associated kinases, which are able to autophosphorylate and to mediate phosphorylation of LT-βR. An in-gel kinase assay was also carried out with MBP as substrate, and signals of 50 kDa and 80 kDa were observed (data not shown), confirming that p50 and p80 can phosphorylate MBP. We wished to identify the region(s) of LT-βR to which the novel kinases, p50 and p80, bind. For this purpose, we constructed several deletion mutants of GST-LT-βR(CD) (Fig.6 A) and expressed the resultant fusion proteins in E. coli (Fig. 6 B). No phosphoproteins were detected following in vitro kinase assays using the deletion mutants Δ1, Δ8 (Fig. 6 C), Δ2, and Δ7 (data not shown). In contrast, it is clear that kinase activity does associate with deletion mutants Δ3, Δ4, Δ5, and Δ6 (Fig.6 C). These results suggest that the minimal region for kinase association is contained within the 54 amino acids present in deletion mutant Δ6. It is possible that other regions of LT-βR might be able to associate with the putative kinase, but are not phosphorylated by it. To rule out this possibility, we incubated the deletion mutants Δ1, Δ2, Δ7, and Δ8 with HepG2 cell lysates. We then performed in vitro kinase assays with wild type GST-LT-βR(CD) as substrate. GST-LT-βR(CD) was not phosphorylated under these conditions (data not shown). Therefore, we conclude that the minimal region for kinase association is located between amino acids 324 and 377 of LT-βR. It is interesting to note that both p50 and p80 were also detected when using deletion mutants Δ3, Δ4, Δ5, and Δ6 as baits in the in vitro kinase assays, but were absent when using Δ1, Δ2, Δ7, and Δ8 in the same experiment (Fig. 6 C). This result supports the co-existence of kinase activity with p50 and p80. Using the yeast two-hybrid and GST fusion protein systems, many proteins have been shown to associate with TNFRs. These include: the tumor necrosis receptor-associated factors, TRAF1–6 (16Mosialos G. Birkenbach M. Yalamanchili R. VanArsdale T. Ware C. Kieff E.

Chem. 1994; 269: 19687-19690Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Among these TNFR-associated proteins, however, only TRAF3 and TRAF5 have been shown to associate with LT-βR (16Mosialos G. Birkenbach M. Yalamanchili R. VanArsdale T. Ware C. Kieff E. Cell. 1995; 389: 389-399Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (906) Google Scholar, 17Nakano H. Oshima H. Chung W. Williams-Abbott L. Ware C.F. Yagita H. Okumura K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14661-14664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). Therefore, we wished to determine whether there are other proteins associated with LT-βR. Using GST-LT-βR(CD) as a bait, we have identified several proteins with molecular mass values of 75–80, 61, 50, 43, 34, and 29 kDa that associate with GST-LT-βR(CD) (Fig.1). Based on molecular mass, the 61-kDa protein might correspond to TRAF3 (62 kDa) and/or TRAF5 (64 kDa). In addition, the results of both in-gel kinase assays and in vitro kinase assays show the presence of two kinases, p80 and p50, associated with the cytoplasmic domain of LT-βR (Figs. 5 and 6). It is likely that the 80- and 50-kDa proteins from [35S]cysteine/methionine-labeled HepG2 cell lysates, that bound to GST-LT-βR(CD) (Fig. 1), correspond to the two LT-βR-associated kinases, p80 and p50, respectively. We are confident that the LT-βR-associated kinases are distinct from the serine/threonine kinases that associate with TNFRI and TNFRII for the following reasons. (i) The LT-βR-associated kinases could only use LT-βR and not TNFRI as substrate in the in vitrokinase assay; (ii) the TNFRII-associated kinase is known to phosphorylate TNFRI, but this phenomenon was not observed for the LT-βR-associated kinases; (iii) the activity of the LT-βR-associated kinases could be inhibited by staurosporine, while the TNFRII-associated kinase activity is only inhibited by CKI-7 and not by staurosporine (26Beyaert R. Vanhaesebroeck B. Declercq W. Van Lint J. Vandenabeele P. Agostinis P. Vandenheede J.R. Fiers W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23293-23299Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar); (iv) the specificities of these receptor-associated kinases for other standard kinase substrates, such as histone H1, casein, and MBP, are all distinct from each other. The LT-βR-associated kinases can phosphorylate histone H1 and MBP, but not casein. By contrast, the TNFRI-associated kinase can phosphorylate both casein and histone H1, but not MBP (21Darnay B.G. Reddy S.A. Aggarwal B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20299-20304Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), while the TNFRII-associated kinase can use MBP as substrate, but not casein or histone H1 (22Darnay B.G. Reddy S.A. Aggarwal B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19687-19690Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Receptor clustering is crucial in the activation of the TNFRs. Using the yeast two-hybrid system, TNFRI (but not TNFRII) has been shown to self-associate (36Song H.Y. Dunbar J.D. Donner D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22492-22495Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 37Boldin M.P. Mett I.L. Varfolomeev E.E. Chumakov I. Shemer-Avni Y. Camonis J.H. Wallach D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 387-391Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar), and it has been suggested that this is a consequence of receptor phosphorylation. Darnay et al. (24VanArsdale T.L. Ware C.F. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 3043-3050PubMed Google Scholar) used GST-TNFRI as bait to identify two phosphoproteins, p55 and p58, associated with TNFRI. The molecular masses of these species suggested that they may correspond to endogenous TNFRI (60 kDa). However, this could not be proved because the anti-TNFRI antibody fails to detect either p55 or p58 on an immunoblot (24VanArsdale T.L. Ware C.F. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 3043-3050PubMed Google Scholar). Using a similar approach, we found an 80-kDa phosphoprotein associated with GST-LT-βR(CD) in thein vitro kinase assay. Since the self-association of the intracellular domain of LT-βR has been observed in the yeast two hybrid system, 3Y. H. Wu-Lee, personal communication. it was possible that p80 corresponded to the endogenous LT-βR, which has a molecular mass of 75–80 kDa (38Gruss H.J. Dower S. Blood. 1995; 85: 3378-3404Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To test this, we used anti-LT-βR antiserum to preclear endogenous LT-βR from HepG2 cell lysates before incubation with GST-LT-βR(CD). In subsequent in vitro kinase assays, the intensity of the p80 phosphoprotein was unchanged despite the complete removal of endogenous LT-βR from the HepG2 cells (data not shown). Therefore, we conclude that the p80 phosphoprotein is not the endogenous LT-βR. The kinase activities associated with TNFRI and TNFRII have been shown to be up-regulated following TNF stimulation (21Darnay B.G. Reddy S.A. Aggarwal B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20299-20304Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Darnay B.G. Reddy S.A. Aggarwal B.B. J. Biol.

Chem. 1995; 270: 14867-14870Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Therefore, the effect of ligand-receptor interaction on the LT-βR-associated kinase activity was examined by treating HepG2 cells with either immobilized anti-LT-βR antibodies or activated RAMOS cells. The latter have been shown to express the membrane-bound LTα1/β2 heterotrimer following phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate stimulation (6Browning J.L. Dougas I. Ngam E.A. Bourdon P.R. Ehrenfels B.N. Miatkowski K. Zafari M. Yampaglia A.M. Lawton P. Meier W. Benjamin C.P. Hession C. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 33-46PubMed Google Scholar). However, the LT-βR-associated kinase activities were not affected by stimulation with either anti-LT-βR or phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-activated RAMOS cells (data not shown). When using an anti-LT-βR monoclonal antibody to precipitate endogenous LT-βR from HepG2 cells for the in vitro kinase assay, we observed that the endogenous LT-βR could only be phosphorylated after treatment of the immunoprecipitates with alkaline phosphatase. 4M.-Y. Wu and S.-L. Hsieh, unpublished data. This suggests that LT-βR is constitutively phosphorylated in the intact cells and supports the argument that the kinase activity could be co-precipitated with endogenous LT-βR, which is the primary target for its associated kinases. Similarly, Beyaert et al. (26Beyaert R. Vanhaesebroeck B. Declercq W. Van Lint J. Vandenabeele P. Agostinis P. Vandenheede J.R. Fiers W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23293-23299Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) and Pennica et al. (29Pennica D. Lam V.T. Mize N.K. Weber R.F. Lewis M. Fendly B.M. Lipari M.T. Goeddel D.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21172-21178Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) immunoprecipitated TNFRII and observed no increase in phosphorylation of this receptor following TNF stimulation. This led them to propose that TNFRII is constitutively phosphorylated. This paper represents the first report of two serine/threonine kinases, p80 and p50, that associate with LT-βR and mediate its phosphorylation. To further understand the roles of these novel kinases in LT-βR signaling pathway(s), a yeast two-hybrid system will be employed to identify the genes encoding p50 and p80. The mechanism by which LT-βR transduces signals after interaction with membrane-bound lymphotoxin also remains to be elucidated. We thank Caroline Milner for critical review of the manuscript.
