https://openalex.org/W2029863361,"X-linked Alport syndrome is a hereditary glomerulonephritis in which progressive loss of kidney function is often accompanied by progressive loss of hearing. Ultrastructural defects in glomerular basement membranes (GBM) of Alport syndrome patients implicate an altered structural protein as the cause of nephritis. The product of COL4A5, the alpha 5(IV) collagen chain, is a specific component of GBM within the kidney, and the gene maps to the same X chromosomal region as does Alport syndrome. Three structural aberrations were found in COL4A5, in intragenic deletion, a Pst I site variant, and an uncharacterized abnormality, which appear to cause nephritis and deafness, with allele-specific severity, in three Alport syndrome kindreds in Utah."
https://openalex.org/W1982882974,"To define the role of TGF alpha in normal tissue function and in pathogenesis, transgenic mice have been generated bearing a fusion gene consisting of the mouse metallothionein 1 promoter and a human TGF alpha cDNA. In these mice, human TGF alpha RNA and protein are abundant in many tissues and TGF alpha is detectable in blood and urine. The effects of TGF alpha overproduction in transgenic mice are pleiotropic and tissue specific. The liver frequently contains multifocal, well-differentiated hepatocellular carcinomas that express enhanced levels of human TGF alpha RNA. The mammary gland exhibits impeded morphogenetic penetration of epithelial duct cells into the stromal fat pad. The pancreas shows progressive interstitial fibrosis and a florid acinoductular metaplasia, during which acinar cells appear to degranulate, dedifferentiate, and assume characteristics of intercalated or centroacinar duct cells. TGF alpha therefore plays an important role in cellular proliferation, organogenesis, and neoplastic transformation."
https://openalex.org/W2086833378,"TGF-beta occurs in a latent complex of high Mr. We report the cDNA cloning and an initial structural and functional characterization of a component of the large latent TGF-beta 1 complex, denoted TGF-beta 1 binding protein (TGF-beta 1-BP). Most of the sequence of fibroblast TGF-beta 1-BP is made up of cysteine-rich repeats of two different kinds; there are 16 EGF-like repeats and three repeats with a distant resemblance to EGF, but of a distinct type hitherto not found in any other protein. beta-hydroxylated asparagine residues were identified in two of the EGF-like repeats. TGF-beta 1-BP purified from human platelets is considerably smaller than the fibroblast form (125-160 kd vs. 170-190 kd), suggesting that there is alternative splicing of the TGF-beta 1-BP gene or that TGF-beta 1-BP undergoes cell-specific proteolysis. TGF-beta 1-BP was found not to bind and inactive TGF-beta 1; its role in the latent complex is discussed."

https://openalex.org/W2034454625,"Pit-1 is a member of a family of transcription factors sharing two regions of homology: a highly conserved POU-specific (POUS) domain and a more divergent homeodomain (POUHD). Analysis of mutant Pit-1 proteins suggests that, while the POUHD is required and sufficient for low affinity DNA binding, the POUS domain is necessary for high affinity binding and accurate recognition of natural Pit-1 response elements. Pit-1 is monomeric in solution but associates as a dimer on its DNA response element, exhibiting DNA-dependent protein-protein interactions requiring the POUS domain. Analysis of alpha-helical domains and conserved structures in Pit-1 suggests that POU domain proteins interact with their DNA recognition sites differently than classic homeodomain proteins, with both the POUHD and the POUS domain contacting DNA. Transcriptional activity of Pit-1 on enhancer elements is conferred primarily by a Ser- and Thr-rich N-terminal region unrelated to other known transcription-activating motifs."
https://openalex.org/W2031408368,"We have used two complementary two-dimensional gel electrophoretic methods to localize replication inititation sites and to determine replication fork direction in the amplified 240 kb dihydrofolate reductase domain of the methotrexate-resistant CHO cell line CHOC 400. Surprisingly, our analysis indicates that replication begins at many sites in several restriction fragments distributed throughout a previously defined 28 kb initiation locus, including a fragment containing a matrix attachment region. Initiation sites were not detected in regions lying upstream or downstream of this locus. Our results suggest that initiation reactions in mammalian chromosomal origins may be more complex than in the origins of simple microorganisms."
https://openalex.org/W1485296430,"When monocytes mature to macrophages, their ability to accumulate the pro-inflammatory lipid autacoid, platelet-activating factor (PAF), is markedly decreased (Elstad, M. R. Stafforini, D. M., McIntyre, T. M., Prescott, S. M., and Zimmerman, G. A. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 8467-8470) in conjunction with a 260-fold increase in the activity of intracellular PAF acetylhydrolase (PAF-AH). We now demonstrate that macrophages also secrete PAF-AH and that the secreted enzyme is biochemically and immunologically identical to the human plasma PAF-AH. It is sensitive to the same active-site-directed inhibitors, has the same electrophoretic mobility, is associated with lipoprotein particles, and transfers between low density lipoprotein and high density lipoprotein in a pH-dependent manner like the plasma PAF-AH. In addition, both activities hydrolyze oxidatively fragmented phospholipids and PAF. These data indicate that macrophages are a cellular source of the plasma PAF-AH. Thus, macrophages secrete an enzyme that inactivates lipid mediators at sites of inflammation and in plasma. These changes during the maturation of monocytes to macrophages may serve to limit the acute inflammatory response."

https://openalex.org/W1557620266,"The clinical significance of the interaction of antibodies with circulating platelets is well documented, but the mechanisms underlying these interactions are not fully known. Here we describe the characterization of anti-human platelet membrane protein monoclonal antibody (mAb) termed F11. Interaction of mAb F11 with human platelets resulted in dose-dependent granular secretion, measured by [14C]serotonin and ATP release, fibrinogen binding and aggregation. Analysis of the specific binding of mAb F11 to platelets revealed a high affinity site with 8,067 +/- 1,307 sites per platelet with a dissociation constant (Kd) of 2.7 +/- 0.9 x 10(-8) M. Two membrane proteins of 32,000 and 35,000 daltons, identified by Western blotting, were recognized by mAb F11. Incubation of 32Pi-labeled platelets with mAb F11 resulted in rapid phosphorylation of intracellular 40,000- and 20,000-dalton proteins, followed by dephosphorylation of these proteins. Monovalent Fab fragments or Fc fragments of mAb F11 IgG did not induce platelet aggregation or secretion; however, Fab fragments of mAb F11 IgG blocked mAb F11-induced platelet aggregation and the binding of 125I-mAb F11 to platelets. The addition of an anti-GPIIIa monoclonal antibody (mAb G10), which inhibits 125I-fibrinogen binding and platelet aggregation, completely blocked mAb F11-induced [14C]serotonin secretion and aggregation but not the binding of 125I-mAb F11 to platelets. mAb G10 also inhibited the increase in the phosphorylation of the 40,000- and 20,000-dalton proteins induced by mAb F11. These results implicate the involvement of the GPIIIa molecule in the chain of biochemical events involved in the induction of granular secretion."

https://openalex.org/W1547667074,"The electrogenicity of H+/Ca2+ exchange in vacuolar membrane (tonoplast) vesicles from Beta was studied to elucidate the role of this transport system in vacuolar Ca2+ accumulation. To overcome the inherently high proton permeability of tonoplast vesicles, the pH difference established by the primary H(+)-ATPase was titrated to a uniform value by variation of the concentration either of ATP or of a permanent anion (Cl-). This enabled manipulation of membrane potential independently of the transmembrane pH difference, with a higher inside-positive membrane potential produced at lower Cl- concentrations. The rate and the extent of uncoupler-sensitive Ca2+ uptake are both stimulated about 2-fold in conditions of more positive membrane potential, suggesting that the transport system translocates positive charge outward during Ca2+ uptake. A minimum integral H+:Ca2+ stoichiometry of 3 results in a driving force for Ca2+ accumulation in the vacuole amounting to -140 mV in typical physiological conditions. It is concluded that the antiporter is thermodynamically competent to account for Ca2+ accumulation in plant vacuoles and that its reversal in vivo is unlikely."
https://openalex.org/W2075633202,"Movement of macromolecules through low concentration agarose gels was investigated with linear poly(styrenesulfonate), linear DNA, star-shaped poly(styrenesulfonate), and circular DNA. Mobilities of weakly entangled flexible macromolecules were independent of molecular radius; within a homologous chemical sequence, electrophoretic separation at low field strengths depended solely on the degree of polymerization. These observations cannot be explained either by sieving or by reptation mechanisms; transport was apparently controlled by spatial variations of chain configurational entropy. Only when the chain was highly entangled did chain topology affect mobility. Evidence for entropically regulated transport clarifies how gel electrophoresis separates flexible macromolecules."
https://openalex.org/W1567164076,"A slow interconversion between two enzyme forms of rat liver glucokinase has been previously inferred from kinetic assay studies. Two different conformations of the enzyme-substrate complex have now been directly demonstrated by an intrinsic fluorescence enhancement in glucokinase upon addition of glucose. The transition between these two conformations upon glucose addition is measurably slow in the presence of glycerol, with a glucose-dependent half-life of 0.5 to more than 10 min. In the presence of 5% glycerol, the forward and reverse isomerization rate constants are 2.6 x 10(-2) s-1 and 8.5 x 10(-4) s-1, respectively. Correspondingly, the overall equilibrium dissociation constant (0.13 mM) is more than 30-fold lower than the first binding step, i.e. the affinity for glucose is greatly increased. This result was also verified by equilibrium titration of the enzyme with glucose. A similar slow transition was analyzed in the presence of 30% glycerol and observed without glycerol. The dilution of stock glucokinase to promote glucose dissociation from the enzyme showed an exponential fluorescence decay, exactly the reverse phenomenon of glucose addition. The deduced rate constant for the reverse reaction coincided with that calculated from the association results. The conformational change is specific for glucose and responsible for the generation of the kinetic cooperativity of this monomeric enzyme, thus playing a regulatory role in the uptake of glucose in liver."
https://openalex.org/W1554834393,"L1210 murine leukemia cells have two nucleoside transport activities that differ in their sensitivity to nitrobenzylmercaptopurine riboside (NBMPR). This study re-examines NBMPR-insensitive nucleoside transport in these cells and finds that it is mediated by two components, one Na(+)-dependent and the other Na(+)-independent. A mutant selected previously for loss of NBMPR-insensitive transport lacks only the Na(+)-independent activity. When NBMPR is used to block efflux via the NBMPR-sensitive transporter, uptake of formycin B (a nonmetabolized analog of inosine) is concentrative in both the parental and mutant cells, but the intracellular concentration of the nucleoside is 5-fold lower in the parental cells. Decreased accumulation of formycin B in the parental cells is due to efflux of the nucleoside via the NBMPR-insensitive, Na(+)-independent transporter that the mutant lacks. The Na(+)-dependent transporter appears to accept most purine, but not pyrimidine, nucleosides as substrates. Two exceptions are uridine, a good substrate, and 7-deazaadenosine, a poor substrate. In contrast, all of the nucleosides tested are substrates for the Na(+)-independent transporter. We conclude that L1210 cells have three distinct nucleoside transporters and that the specificity of the Na(+)-dependent transporter is similar to that of one of the two Na(+)-dependent nucleoside transporters seen in mouse intestinal epithelial cells."
https://openalex.org/W1489921776,"The peptidylglycine alpha-amidating enzyme catalyzes a reaction that transforms a carboxyl-terminal glycine-extended precursor into a carboxyl-terminal alpha-amidated peptide. We purified an alpha-amidating enzyme from equine serum by simplified steps including substrate affinity chromatography. With the purified enzyme, we detected an intermediate of the alpha-amidating reaction by high performance liquid chromatography analysis. The production of the intermediate required copper, oxygen, and ascorbate and increased linearly with incubation time. The structure of the intermediate was determined to be a hydroxyl derivative at the carboxyl-terminal glycine by fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry and by proton NMR. The intermediate was readily converted into an alpha-amidated product in alkaline conditions in a nonenzymic fashion. The nonenzymic conversion required no cofactor but was extremely accelerated by the addition of copper ion or at higher temperature. Our data suggest that the direct product of the alpha-amidating reaction is not an alpha-amidated peptide but a hydroxyl derivative at the alpha-carbon of the carboxyl-terminal glycine."
https://openalex.org/W2086399984,"In each gonadal arm of wild-type C. elegans hermaphrodites, the somatic distal tip cell (DTC) maintains distal germline nuclei in mitosis, while proximal nuclei enter meiosis. We have identified two conditions under which a proximal somatic cell, the anchor cell (AC), inappropriately maintains proximal germline nuclei in mitosis: when defined somatic gonadal cells have been ablated in wild type, and in lin-12 null mutants. Laser ablations and mosaic analysis indicate that somatic gonadal cells neighboring the AC normally require lin-12 activity to prevent the inappropriate AC-germline interaction. The AC-germline interaction, like the DTC-germline interaction, requires glp-1 activity. In one model, we propose that the AC sends an intercellular signal intended to interact with the lin-12 product in somatic gonadal cells; when lin-12 activity is absent, the signal interacts instead with the related glp-1 product in germline. Our data illustrate the importance of mechanisms that prevent inappropriate interactions during development."

https://openalex.org/W1572398159,"In previous work we showed that programmed cell death (PCD) in thymocytes is mediated by a sustained increase in cytosolic Ca2+ concentration, resulting in the activation of an endogenous endonuclease, DNA fragmentation, and cell death. In this study we investigated the roles of Ca2+ and DNA fragmentation in target cell killing by natural killer (NK) cells. The effector cells induced a rapid, sustained increase in cytosolic Ca2+ concentration in Jurkat target cells. Buffering the target cell cytosolic Ca2+ with the Ca2(+)-selective dye, quin-2, prevented target cell killing. Extensive DNA fragmentation was associated with killing in every target tested, and this response was also blocked by quin-2. The endonuclease inhibitor, aurintricarboxylic acid, inhibited both DNA fragmentation and killing without influencing the Ca2+ increase in target cells. Thus, it is concluded that NK cell killing depends on a Ca2+ increase and appears to involve endogenous endonuclease activation in target cells."
https://openalex.org/W1584076226,"A radioiodinated, photoactivatable derivative of Salmonella minnesota Re595 lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was used to label LPS-binding proteins in 70Z/3 cells. The labeled proteins were resolved by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and visualized by autoradiography. 125I-Labeled-2-(p-azidosalycylamido)1,3'-dithiopropionamide S. minnesota Re595 LPS (125I-ASD-Re595) labeled a limited number of proteins. The most prominent of these had a apparent molecular mass of 18 kDa. Less prominent labeling of 25- and 28-kDa proteins was also seen. Labeling was saturated by 5 micrograms/ml 125I-ASD-Re595 and was inhibited by a 10-100-fold excess of unlabeled LPS or lipid A. Labeling was maximal within 30 min at 37 degrees C; much less labeling occurred at lower temperatures. The proteins labeled with 125I-ASD-Re595 appear to be on the surface of the cell, since they can be digested by trypsin and were found in the membrane fraction of the cell but not in the cytosol. Studies with competitive inhibitors suggested that the proteins bind to the lipid A region of the LPS molecule. Biologically inactive lipid A analogs were poor inhibitors of labeling, suggesting that the LPS-binding proteins could discriminate between active lipid A and inactive analogs. These studies suggest that the 18- and 25-kDa proteins bind specifically to the lipid A region of the LPS molecule and should be considered as candidates for a functional LPS receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1508668263,"We have characterized a tobacco nuclear factor that binds to the -118 region of the nopaline synthase (nos) promoter from the Ti plasmid of Agrobacterium tumefaciens. The binding site for this factor, identified by DNase I footprinting, encompasses the region from -138 to -103 of the nos promoter. This region, which contains a potential Z-DNA-forming sequence, was previously shown to be essential for nos promoter activity in transgenic tobacco. A synthetic 21-base pair sequence from the protected region (from -131 to -111), designated as nos-1, was sufficient for factor recognition in vitro. In transgenic tobacco, a tetramer of nos-1 can confer leaf and root expression when fused upstream of a truncated 35 S promoter from the cauliflower mosaic virus. Mutations at the two TGACG-like motifs in nos-1 abolish factor binding while preserving the potential for Z-DNA formation. A tetramer of the nos-1 mutant sequence has no significant activity above background when tested in transgenic tobacco. Competition experiments with activation sequence factor (ASF)-1 binding sites from the 35 S promoter of cauliflower mosaic virus (as-1) and the wheat histone H3 promoter (hex-1) demonstrate that ASF-1 is the factor that binds to nos-1."
https://openalex.org/W1581781732,"A new enzyme capable of hydrolyzing chitobiose, which is an induced enzyme, was purified to apparent homogeneity from the culture filtrate of Nocardia orientalis IFO 12806. Biospecific affinity chromatography on chitotriitol-Sepharose CL-4B was effective for purification of this enzyme. It is clearly demonstrated that the enzyme is an exo-hydrolase, removing single glucosamine residues from the nonreducing terminal of a sequence of beta-(1----4)-linked glucosamine chain, such as chitosan and chitooligosaccharides, and therefore characterized as an exo-beta-D-glucosaminidase. The enzyme was found to show maximum activity on chitotetraose, chitopentaose, and their corresponding alcohols and a slight decrease in rate on longer chain lengths of substrates. A significant decrease in rate was observed using p-nitrophenyl beta-D-glucosaminide and chitobiitol as substrates. In the hydrolysis of partially acetylated chitosans, the enzyme appeared to be effective in cleaving glucosamine from the GlcN beta 1----4GlcNAc beta 1----sequence as well as the GlcN beta 1----4GlcN beta 1----sequence. These observations suggest that the second residue from the terminal plays an important role in enzyme activity, but the enzyme permits the replacement of glucosamine at the second residue by N-acetylglucosamine."
https://openalex.org/W2170834040,"The earliest marker of the megakaryocyte lineage in human bone marrow is a heterodimeric complex of glycoproteins IIb (GPIIb) and IIIa (GPIIIa). GPIIb-IIIa is a member of the integrin family and serves as a receptor for fibrinogen and other adhesive glycoproteins on the surface of activated blood platelets. Mature platelet GPIIb is processed from a single precursor peptide into a disulfide-linked GPIIb alpha and GPIIb beta chain. To study possible mechanisms which could determine ligand specificity of the GPIIb-IIIa complex we investigated whether there are multiple forms of GPIIb mRNA by screening an unamplified lambda gt10 human erythroleukemia cell cDNA library. Four GPIIb clones were isolated and sequenced. Two contained a 102-nucleotide in-frame deletion corresponding to 34 amino acids in the extracellular domain of GPIIb beta. Polymerase chain reaction amplification of human erythroleukemia cell cDNA confirmed the presence of two different transcripts. Normal genomic DNA sequence was shown to contain consensus splice-donor and splice-acceptor sites indicating a 102-base pair exon that is spliced in or out. Using primers specific for either transcript, both forms of GPIIb mRNA were identified by the polymerase chain reaction in normal human platelets and megakaryocytes, but not in reticulocytes or two white blood cell lines. These data provide evidence for two forms of GPIIb in platelets and megakaryocytes and suggest a mechanism for variations in receptor ligand affinity or localization."
https://openalex.org/W1591837374,"We have isolated genomic clones encoding the two major classes of seed storage proteins in oats, the 12 S globulins and the avenins. The globulin genes encode glutamine-rich, sulfur-poor storage proteins that are highly conserved in sequence and structure. The globulin genes contain three short introns whose positions in the coding sequence are the same as in storage globulin genes in legumes and other dicots. The avenin genomic clone contains four tightly linked genes that belong to both of the two avenin gene subfamilies. The avenin genes encode glutamine-rich, lysine-poor proteins that vary in length due to differences in the number of peptide repeats. Although globulin and avenin genes are expressed coordinately during oat seed development, their promoter regions do not contain any conserved sequence elements that might determine developmental timing. Previous studies showed that there are roughly equal amounts of globulin and avenin mRNAs in developing oat seed, despite there being much more globulin than avenin in mature seed. Storage protein synthesis in oats must therefore be controlled partially by post-transcriptional mechanisms. Sequence analysis of globulin and avenin genes has provided several clues as to why globulin mRNAs may be translated more efficiently than avenin mRNAs."
https://openalex.org/W2029564388,"The defensive spray of the bombardier beetle Stenaptinus insignis is ejected in quick pulses (at about 500 pulses per second) rather than as a continuous stream. The pulsation may be a consequence of intermittency in the explosive chemical process that generates the spray. The ejection system of the beetle shows basic similarity to the pulse jet propulsion mechanism of the German V-1 ""buzz"" bomb of World War II."
https://openalex.org/W2003102772,"A large number of computer vision algorithms for finding intensity edges, computing motion, depth, and color, and recovering the three-dimensional shape of objects have been developed within the framework of minimizing an associated ""energy"" or ""cost"" functional. Particularly successful has been the introduction of binary variables coding for discontinuities in intensity, optical flow field, depth, and other variables, allowing image segmentation to occur in these modalities. The associated nonconvex variational functionals can be mapped onto analog, resistive networks, such that the stationary voltage distribution in the network corresponds to a minimum of the functional. The performance of an experimental analog very-large-scale integration (VLSI) circuit implementing the nonlinear resistive network for the problem of two-dimensional surface interpolation in the presence of discontinuities is demonstrated; this circuit is implemented in complementary metal oxide semiconductor technology."
https://openalex.org/W1490717064,"Recent reports suggest that protein kinase C is involved in neural differentiation. We show that 1-(5-isoquinolinylsulfonyl)-2-methylpiperazine (H7), the more specific inhibitor of protein kinase C known, induces morphological and functional differentiation of neuro 2a cells, as indicated by the marked increase in the number of neurites/cell and in acetylcholinesterase activity. HA 1004 does not induce differentiation of neural cells. The induction of differentiation by H7 was very rapid; 3 h after addition of H7 the percentages of differentiated cells were 17, 33, 37, 55, and 75% for 17, 50, 85, 250, and 500 microM H7, respectively, while for controls it was 9%. When 500 microM H7 was added to the culture medium, protein kinase C was inhibited by 72 and 62% in cytosol and membrane, respectively. Also, acetylcholinesterase activity (a marker of functional differentiation) increased with time, reaching a 7-fold increase after 48 h."
https://openalex.org/W1556906420,"Stopped-flow fluorescence kinetic measurements, circular dichroism (CD), and 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy at 360 MHz have been used to study the interaction of the calcium-channel blocker and calmodulin antagonist bepridil with cardiac troponin C (cTnC) in the presence of calcium. The kinetic data show that bepridil reduces the rate of calcium release only from the low affinity, calcium-specific site and not from the two high affinity calcium/magnesium sites. CD measurements indicate that drug binding leads to a small increase in the alpha-helical content of the complex. 1H NMR shows that the protein binds one equivalent of bepridil, with a dissociation constant of approximately 20 microM, only when the low affinity calcium site is occupied. Exchange is fast or intermediate on the chemical shift time scale. Drug binding is shown to be largely localized in the N-terminal domain, containing the low affinity calcium site, by observing the shifting and broadening of several resonances associated with that domain. These include assigned aromatic signals together with methionyl and other methyl signals. Observation of intermolecular nuclear Overhauser effects was precluded by extensive spectral overlap. Consideration of the data from the three techniques permitted a model of the bepridil-cTnC complex to be constructed, using the model of cTnC derived from the x-ray structure of calmodulin (MacLachlan L. K., Reid, D. G., and Carter, N. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 9754-9763). Binding of bepridil to a prominent hydrophobic depression in the N-terminal domain can be invoked to explain many of the induced changes in the spectral and kinetic properties of the protein. The implications of the model for the calcium sensitizing action of bepridil are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1503922932,"The T cell antigen receptor complex (TCR) and the interleukin 2 (IL-2) receptor are responsible for signal transduction that results in T lymphocyte activation and proliferation. Stimulation of either the TCR or the IL-2 receptor induces an increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of several cellular proteins indicating that signal transduction by both of these receptors involves the activation of a tyrosine protein kinase. Although the tyrosine protein kinases activated by these receptors have not yet been characterized the receptors themselves are known not to contain a tyrosine protein kinase domain. To determine if these receptors are coupled to the activation of similar or distinct tyrosine protein kinases we examined the patterns and kinetics of tyrosine phosphorylation induced by stimulation of these receptors on a cloned cell line. Hut 78.3 cells co-express the TCR and the p75 IL-2 receptor. These cells were stimulated with either OKT3 antibodies, specific for the TCR, or with IL-2. Signal transduction by these receptors was found to increase the tyrosine phosphorylation of a set of proteins unique to each stimulus. The kinetics of the tyrosine phosphorylation induced by OKT3 antibodies also differed from that induced by IL-2. The OKT3-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation reached maximal levels within 2.5 min and began to decline by 5 min after stimulation. In contrast, the IL-2-induced tyrosine phosphorylation did not achieve maximal levels until 15 min after the addition of IL-2 and the proteins remained phosphorylated even after 60 min of incubation. In addition the tyrosine phosphorylations induced by OKT3 and IL-2 were not affected by prior stimulation with the other agent. These results demonstrate that the TCR and IL-2 receptor are coupled to different signal transduction pathways responsible for the independent activation of distinct tyrosine protein kinases."
https://openalex.org/W1521483192,"Calbindin-D28K is a 1 alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3-dependent protein that belongs to the superfamily of high affinity calcium-binding proteins which includes parvalbumin, calmodulin, and troponin C. All of these proteins bind Ca2+ ligands by an alpha-helix-loop-alpha-helix domain that is termed an EF-hand. Calbindin-D28K has been reported previously to have four high affinity Ca2(+)-binding sites (KD less than 10(-7)) as quantitated by equilibrium dialysis. With the determination of the amino acid sequence, it was clear that there are in fact six apparent EF-hand domains, although the Ca2(+)-binding functionality of the two additional domains was unclear. It was of interest to quantitate the Ca2(+)-binding ability of chick intestinal calbindin-D28K utilizing several different Ca2+ titration methods that cover a range of macroscopic binding constants for weak or strong Ca2+ sites. Titrations with the Ca2+ chelator dibromo-1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)-ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid (5,5'-Br2BAPTA), a Ca2+ selective electrode, and as followed by 1H NMR, which measure KD values of 10(-6)-10(-8) M, 10(-4)-10(-7) and 10(-3)-10(-5) M, respectively, gave no evidence for the presence of weak Ca2(+)-binding sites. However, Ca2+ titration of the fluorescent Ca2+ chelator Quin 2 in the presence of calbindin-D28K yielded a least squares fit optimal for 5.7 +/- 0.8 Ca2(+)-binding sites with macroscopic dissociation constants around 10(-8) M. The binding of Ca2+ by calbindin was found to be cooperative with at least two of the sites exhibiting positive cooperativity."
https://openalex.org/W1534628719,"The rat K and T kininogen genes show different modes of mRNA production. The K gene encodes two distinct mRNAs for high molecular weight (HMW) and low molecular weight (LMW) kininogens. These two mRNAs are generated by differential usage of the 3'-terminal exon (LMW exon) and the exon next to and upstream from the LMW exon (HMW exon) through alternative splicing and polyadenylation. In contrast, the T gene generates one mRNA by using selectively the LMW exon, although the T gene is extremely homologous to the K gene. In this study, we constructed a series of chimeric kininogen genes by not only exchanging equivalent restriction fragments of the two genes but also replacing nucleotides that differ between the two genes. We then examined the sequences and the mechanisms governing the different expression patterns of the two genes by transfecting the chimeric genes into heterologous COS cells. The results indicated that the different expression patterns of the K and T genes are governed by two separate internal sequences of the HMW and LMW exons. The internal HMW sequence contains a set of five repetitive sequences, and these repetitive sequences are highly complementary to the 5' portion of U1 snRNA. Furthermore, the nucleotide differences in the U1 snRNA-complementary sequences between the K and T genes have marked effects on the relative formation of the HMW and LMW mRNAs; this indicates that the repetitive sequences complementary to U1 snRNA play a crucial role in determining the relative expression of the two mRNAs. Based on these findings, we discuss a novel mechanism for alternative RNA processing, in which splicing efficiency is controlled by the interaction of U1 small nuclear ribonucleoproteins and the U1 snRNA-complementary repetitive sequences of the kininogen pre-mRNA."
https://openalex.org/W1569626752,"Fatty acid ethyl esters are a family of neutral lipids that are the products of esterification of fatty acids with ethanol. Unlike other pathways of ethanol metabolism, ethyl esters are present in numerous human organs which are the targets of ethanol-induced damage. In the present study, we have shown that fatty acid ethyl esters are synthesized by a hepatoma cell line in tissue culture when exposed to ethanol concentrations easily attained by man during social drinking. Unlike alcohol dehydrogenase, the enzyme(s) responsible for synthesis of ethyl esters are membrane-bound and concentrated in the microsomal fraction of rat hepatocytes. In addition, fatty acid ethyl esters are hydrolyzed to free fatty acids and ethanol by membrane-bound enzyme(s) that are enriched in the microsomal and mitochondrial-lysosomal fractions. Intracellular hydrolysis of fatty acid ethyl esters release free fatty acids which are preferentially incorporated into cellular cholesterol esters. Thus, we have shown that a hepatocellular line exposed to concentrations of ethanol easily achieved in man by social drinking utilize endogenous fatty acids to form long-lived ethanol metabolites, fatty acid ethyl esters. Importantly, this family of neutral lipids may act as biochemical mediators of ethanol-induced cell damage, including the changes in cholesterol metabolism noted in chronic alcoholics."

Loosening of the tightly folded native structure of the two proteins following their synthesis in a rabbit reticulocyte lysate was assayed by the acquisition of protease sensitivity (pODHFR and pOCAT) or by the loss of enzyme activity (pOCAT). By these criteria, the bulk population of both precursor proteins was tightly folded following release from the ribosome, even in the presence of ATP and excess reticulocyte lysate. Neither protein unfolded as a consequence of binding to the surfaces of anionic liposomes or intact mitochondria. However, a non-native form of full-length pOCAT, exhibiting a loss of enzymatic activity and an enhanced protease sensitivity, was detected in association with a submitochondrial fraction that banded between the inner and outer mitochondrial membrane fractions on sucrose density gradients. Delivery of the precursor molecule to this position required ATP and a proteinaceous component on the surface of the organelle."
https://openalex.org/W1531953806,"Human fetal kidney mesangial cells were cultured for 24 h in the presence of 3H-amino acids and [35S] sulfate and chased for 24 h in nonradioactive medium. Incubation medium and cell layer proteoglycans were purified twice by high performance liquid chromatography-DEAE chromatography followed by gel filtration chromatography. The major medium 35S-macromolecules were chondroitin/dermatan-35SO4 proteoglycans. A small, Sepharose CL-6B Kav 0.14 dermatan-35SO4 proteoglycan was detected in the labeling medium and was released into both the early (time 0-0.5 h) and late (6-24 h) chase media. It contained 38 kDa 4-sulfated 35S-GAGs with a high content of iduronic acid and a 45-kDa protein core. A protein core of similar molecular weight was detected in the culture medium by Western analysis using antibodies to biglycan or proteoglycan-I (Fisher, L. W., Termine, J. D., and Young, M. F. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 4571-4576). This 35S-proteoglycan was not detected in the cell layer. However, a small dermatan-35SO4 with little or no protein core was present in the intracellular compartment. A large, Sepharose CL-6B excluded chondroitin-35SO4 proteoglycan was released into the culture medium and was detected between 6 and 24 h in chase medium. It eluted near the void volume of both associative and dissociative Sepharose CL-4B columns. It contained 30-kDa 4- and 6-sulfated 35S-GAGs and a 253-kDa protein core. A chondroitin-35SO4 proteoglycan with similar sized 35S-GAGs was detected in both the detergent-soluble and insoluble cell layer compartments. A Sepharose CL-6B Kav 0.11 heparin-35SO4 proteoglycan with a 220-kDa protein core and 38-kDa 35S-GAGs was rapidly released from the cell layer. This proteoglycan was larger than that previously described in isolated rat glomeruli or glomerular basement membranes, but had a core protein similar in size to one previously detected in these tissues. A larger heparan-35SO4 proteoglycan with larger 35S-GAGs was present in the detergent-insoluble cell layer compartment. The proteoglycans released by glomerular mesangial cells in culture resembled those synthesized by aortic smooth muscle cells in culture or extracted from aorta, supporting the notion that these cells are of vascular origin."
https://openalex.org/W1614756392,"Modulator is a novel ether aminophosphoglyceride that is commonly known as the low-molecular weight inhibitor of glucocorticoid-receptor complex activation. An ultra-large scale purification of modulator has been performed from 1000 rat livers. This purification was similar to our previous one (Bodine, P. V., and Litwack, G. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 3501-3512), but involved the chromatography of heated rat liver cytosol on a 7-liter bed volume Sephadex G-15 gel filtration column. Two peaks of modulator activity eluted from the giant gel-filtration column, and these two modulators (peak-1 and peak-2) were chromatographed separately on Dowex-1 anion-exchange columns. Both modulators were determined to be homogeneous after this step by analytical high-performance thin-layer chromatography, analytical high-performance liquid chromatography, and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Furthermore, although peak-1 and peak-2 differed in molecular weight, the two modulators co-chromatographed by anion-exchange, high-performance thin-layer, and high-performance liquid chromatography. These results suggest that the two modulators have similar structures and therefore appear to be isoforms of each other. In addition, both of the modulators are organic molecules that are devoid of molybdenum and 62 other metals. Activity assays indicated that the larger peak-1 modulator was five times more potent than the smaller peak-2 modulator at inhibiting receptor activation and at stabilizing the steroid-binding ability of the occupied and unoccupied receptors. Mixing experiments indicated that the activities of the two modulators were synergistic for both receptor activation inhibition and for occupied receptor steroid-binding stabilization. However, the effects of peak-1 and peak-2 modulator on unoccupied receptor steroid-binding stabilization were additive. Thus, although the two modulators have similar chemical structures, the biological potencies of the two compounds are different. Moreover, these results suggest that although the unoccupied/unactivated receptor has only one modulator binding site, the occupied/unactivated receptor has two modulator binding sites, one site for each of the isoforms."
https://openalex.org/W1550327547,"A glycosylated protein (small, cartilage-derived glycoprotein, SCGP) of approximately 18 kDa with unknown function has been isolated from dissociative extracts of bovine nasal cartilage and its primary structure determined. The protein has 121 amino acids, giving a calculated protein molecular weight of 13,878, four disulfide bonds, two N-linked oligosaccharides and one O-linked oligosaccharide. In nasal cartilage, this glycoprotein is in molar concentrations equivalent to 1/5-1/2 that of the link protein of cartilage proteoglycan aggregates, and it has also been isolated from bovine articular cartilage and from bovine fetal epiphysis. The N-terminal, glycosylated region of the molecule is relatively rich in arginine, proline, glycine, and threonine. The C-terminal 82 amino acids (which contains all four of the disulfide bonds and none of the carbohydrate) can be found as a discrete entity in cartilage extracts, indicating that the N-terminal domain is readily removed by extracellular proteolytic attack."

https://openalex.org/W1560942464,"1H NMR spectroscopy at 360 MHz has been used to study the interactions between the calmodulin function inhibitor calmidazolium (R24571) and (i) calmodulin (CaM) and (ii) skeletal muscle troponin C (sTnC). One equivalent of racemic calmidazolium binds tightly to CaM and perturbs a number of protein signals, corresponding to residues in both dicalcium-binding domains, in a manner characteristic of slow exchange. Calmidazolium binds with lower affinity to sTnC but still induces widespread perturbations in both domains. Extensive spectral overlap precludes definite assignment of intermolecular nuclear Overhauser effect (NOEs) although intraprotein NOEs do indicate the nature of some drug-induced conformational changes. Relaxation enhancements induced by two spin-labeled calmidazolium analogues demonstrate that several methionine residues of CaM, significantly immobilized by calmidazolium binding, are in fact located at or near its binding sites. These and other residue-specific broadening effects have enabled low resolution models to be constructed of the predominantly hydrophobic drug-binding sites on each domain of CaM. The hydrophobic portions of calmidazolium itself, and its analogues, contact side chains of Ala-15, Leu-18, Phe-19, Val-35, Met-36, Leu-37, Leu-39, Met-51, Met-71, Met-72, and Met-76 in the N-terminal domain of calmodulin, and Ala-88, Val-91, Phe-92, Val-108, Met-109, Leu-112, Phe-141, and Met-145 in its C-terminal domain. The model, and an analogous one of sTnC, can be used to rationalize drug-induced changes in intraprotein NOEs. Issues pertaining to the possible simultaneous binding of calmidazolium to both globular domains of the proteins are discussed in terms of the experimental results and the overall structures of each protein."
https://openalex.org/W1534779916,"When molded polystyrene (PS) products (e.g., microtiter plates) or latex particles are irradiated with high-energy (1-10 Mrads) gamma rays in the presence of nonpolymerizable small molecules such as aromatic amines, some of these molecules incorporate into PS, which leads to the formation of radio-derivatized PS (RDPS). Two classes of RDPS can be identified regarding their ability for immobilization of biologically important molecules: 1) reactive RDPS that are able to form covalent bonds with molecules such as proteins without the help of cross-linkers, and 2) functionalized RDPS that can be used for the immobilization of molecules with activators (e.g., carbodiimides) or cross-linkers. The method can be used for the production of low-noise supports for binding assays. Most of the RDPS can be produced without impairment of the optical quality of PS, making derivatized microtiter plates suitable for colorimetric assays. The principle can be applied for the preparation of affinity sorbents, e.g., for high-performance affinity chromatography and for the immobilization of enzymes using latex PS particles.—Varga, J. M.; Fritsch, P. Immobilization of small molecules and proteins by radio-derivatized polystyrene. FASEB J. 4: 2671-2677, 1990."
https://openalex.org/W1552515918,"We have analyzed the structure of the gene coding for the alpha 2(VI) subunit of chicken type VI collagen. The triple-helical domain of this polypeptide is encoded by 19 short exons distributed over 10 kilobase pairs of genomic DNA. These exons begin with the codon for glycine and end with the codon for the Y amino acid of the collagenous triplet Gly-X-Y. The sizes of the exons are integral multiples of 9 base pairs (bp) (27, 36, 45, 54, 63, and 90 bp), the predominant one being 63 bp. The organization of this type VI collagen gene is therefore quite different from that of the fibrillar collagen genes which have evolved by duplication of a primordial 54-bp unit. It also differs from that of the basement membrane collagen genes whose exon/intron boundaries often split the codons for amino acids."
https://openalex.org/W1587837752,"U6 small nuclear RNA (snRNA) is a required component in the splicing of eukaryotic pre-mRNAs. Mammalian U6 snRNA was synthesized in vitro by T7 RNA polymerase and purified on polyacrylamide gels. This U6 RNA, with pppG on its 5' end, was accurately capped to CH3-O-pppG, when incubated with HeLa cell extract and this capping was dependent on the capping signal present within the U6 snRNA. When gamma-32P-labeled U6 RNA was used as a substrate, the U6 cap formed in vitro retained this labeled gamma-phosphate, indicating that the cap formation involves the methylation of the gamma-phosphate incorporated during transcription. U6 snRNAs with ppG or pG as their 5' ends, were not capped in this in vitro capping system. Capping of U6 snRNA in vitro requires at least two components, a heat-labile component and S-adenosylmethionine as a methyl group donor. The data presented here show that capping of U6 snRNA can be uncoupled from transcription and that the mechanism of U6 snRNA cap formation differs markedly from the capping mechanism of mRNAs and other U snRNAs where capping is cotranscriptional. While many methyltransferases have been characterized earlier, this is the first report of a methyltransferase that is specific to phosphate residues. This in vitro capping system will be useful for purification and studies on the U6 snRNA sequence-dependent methyltransferase activity."
https://openalex.org/W1524744291,"We have directly tested the ability of acetoacetate, upon activation to the CoA thioester, to channel into the cholesterogenic pathway prior to scrambling of its carbon skeleton with the acetate pool. The approach relies upon trapping [3-13C]acetoacetate-derived hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA, hydrolyzing this metabolite, and esterifying the resulting hydroxymethylglutaric acid to allow gas chromatography/mass spectrometry analysis of the dimethyl esters for the 13C enrichment and labeling pattern. 99% enriched [3-13C] and [1,3,5-13C]hydroxymethylglutaric acid samples were synthesized, providing standards against which physiological samples could be compared. Cytosolic extracts from brain and liver of cholestyramine-fed rats were incubated with [3-13C]acetoacetate (2 mM) or with [1-13C]acetate (5 mM). In contrast to [13C]acetate-derived hydroxymethylglutarate, which shows the expected triple labeling pattern, [13C]acetoacetate-derived hydroxymethylglutarate from both liver and brain extracts is predominantly monolabeled. These data suggest that, after acetoacetate is activated to the CoA thioester, cytosolic hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA synthase effectively commits much of this acetoacetyl-CoA to cholesterogenesis before thiolase can scramble the carbon skeleton of the acetoacetyl moiety into the acetate pool. This chemical approach represents an alternative method for testing the channeling of metabolites through sequential steps in a metabolic pathway. Such a method may be useful when physical or kinetic techniques prove to be unsuitable."
https://openalex.org/W1587365733,"The Eu3+ 7F0----5D0 excitation spectra of parvalbumin and oncomodulin are pH-dependent. Until now, it had been assumed that both the CD and EF ion-binding sites shared this property and that deprotonation of water molecules coordinated to the bound Eu3+ ions might be responsible for the pH dependence. Results obtained with the site-specific variant of oncomodulin known as D59E, in which glutamate replaces the aspartate naturally present at position 59, have necessitated substantial revision of these ideas. It now appears that the pH-dependent behavior is confined to the CD site. Moreover, we observe no corresponding change in the number of O-H oscillators coordinated to the bound Eu3+ ions in the pH range over which we observe the spectroscopic alteration. It is likely that the behavior results from deprotonation of one or more carboxyl groups clustered at the COOH-terminal end of the CD domain."
https://openalex.org/W1598573005,"The effect of concanavalin A on proteoglycan synthesis by rabbit costal and articular chondrocytes was examined. Chondrocytes were seeded at low density and grown to confluency in medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, and then the serum concentration was reduced to 0.3%. At the low serum concentration, chondrocytes adopted a fibroblastic morphology. Addition of concanavalin A to the culture medium induced a morphologic alteration of the fibroblastic cells to spherical chondrocytes and increased by 3- to 4-fold incorporation of [35S]sulfate and [3H]glucosamine into large chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan that was characteristically found in cartilage. The stimulation of incorporation of labeled precursors reflected real increases in proteoglycan synthesis, as chemical analyses showed a 4-fold increase in the accumulation of macromolecules containing hexuronic acid in concanavalin A-maintained cultures. Furthermore, the effect of concanavalin A on [35S]sulfate incorporation into proteoglycans was greater than that of various growth factors or hormones. However, concanavalin A had smaller effects on [35S]sulfate incorporation into small proteoglycans and [3H]glucosamine incorporation into hyaluronic acid and chondroitinase AC-resistant glycosaminoglycans. Since other lectins tested, such as wheat germ agglutinin, lentil lectin, and phytohemagglutinin, had little effect on [35S]sulfate incorporation into proteoglycans, the concanavalin A action on chondrocytes seems specific. Although concanavalin A decreased [3H]thymidine incorporation in chondrocytes, the stimulation of proteoglycan synthesis could be observed in chondrocytes exposed to the inhibitor of DNA synthesis, cytosine arabinoside. These results indicate that concanavalin A is a potent modulator of proteoglycan synthesis by chondrocytes."
https://openalex.org/W1553079974,"Proton (1H) NMR at 360 MHz has been used to characterize calcium-induced spectral changes in bovine cardiac troponin C in more detail than hitherto reported (Hincke, M. T., Sykes, B. D., and Kay, C. M. (1981) Biochemistry 20, 3286-3294). The observed changes are consistent with two equivalents of calcium occupying high affinity sites, with subsequent binding of a single equivalent to a lower affinity site. Two-dimensional J-correlated and nuclear Overhauser effect NOE-correlated and conventional one-dimensional NOE experiments, combined with a consideration of the titration behavior, have allowed all the aromatic signals, and several prominently shifted alpha-CH and methyl group signals, as well as some methionine methyl signals of the calcium-saturated protein, to be assigned. This exercise was facilitated by the construction of a model of the calcium-bound protein based on crystal structure data of the homologous calmodulin and skeletal troponin C, using mutations, energy minimizations, and molecular dynamics simulations, combined with the ring-current shift and NOE prediction program PARSNIP (Reid, D. G., and Saunders, M. R. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 2003-2012)."
https://openalex.org/W1567220865,"The genes that encode the small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs) are unusual RNA polymerase II transcription units in that 5'-flanking DNA sequences more than 50 base pairs upstream of snRNA genes are essential for specifying the transcription initiation site. The relevant cis-acting DNA sequence, termed the proximal sequence element (PSE), is required for both transcription initiation and 3'-end formation of snRNAs. We have used site-directed mutagenesis and expression in Xenopus oocytes to map nucleotides important for the function of the chicken U4B snRNA gene PSE. The results indicate that nucleotide sequences upstream of position -65 are not required for U4B PSE activity. However, nucleotides lying within a region 53-65 base pairs upstream of the U4B gene are essential for obtaining a detectable level of U4B gene expression. Six nucleotides between positions -53 and -59 were identified at which base substitutions reduced the transcriptional activity of the U4B gene."

These cells produced significant serum levels of hGH when implanted intraperitoneally, subcutaneously, or intravenously into nude mice. Implantation of Ec/XGH-1 cells under the renal capsule resulted in the formation of large cysts that contained concentrations of hGH that were several thousand times greater than those in serum assayed simultaneously from the same animals.
