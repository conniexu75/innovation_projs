https://openalex.org/W2083505983,"Chronic low-grade inflammation associated with obesity contributes to insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. Helminth parasites are the strongest natural inducers of type 2 immune responses, and short-lived infection with rodent nematodes was reported to improve glucose tolerance in obese mice. Here, we investigated the effects of chronic infection (12 weeks) with Schistosoma mansoni, a helminth that infects millions of humans worldwide, on whole-body metabolic homeostasis and white adipose tissue (WAT) immune cell composition in high-fat diet-induced obese C57BL/6 male mice. Our data indicate that chronic helminth infection reduced body weight gain (-62%), fat mass gain (-89%), and adipocyte size; lowered whole-body insulin resistance (-23%) and glucose intolerance (-16%); and improved peripheral glucose uptake (+25%) and WAT insulin sensitivity. Analysis of immune cell composition by flow cytometry and quantitative PCR (qPCR) revealed that S. mansoni promoted strong increases in WAT eosinophils and alternatively activated (M2) macrophages. Importantly, injections with S. mansoni-soluble egg antigens (SEA) recapitulated the beneficial effect of parasite infection on whole-body metabolic homeostasis and induced type 2 immune responses in WAT and liver. Taken together, we provide novel data suggesting that chronic helminth infection and helminth-derived molecules protect against metabolic disorders by promoting a T helper 2 (Th2) response, eosinophilia, and WAT M2 polarization."
https://openalex.org/W2121102205,"A role for type A Clostridium perfringens in acute hemorrhagic and necrotizing gastroenteritis in dogs and in necrotizing enterocolitis of neonatal foals has long been suspected but incompletely characterized. The supernatants of an isolate made from a dog and from a foal that died from these diseases were both found to be highly cytotoxic for an equine ovarian (EO) cell line. Partial genome sequencing of the canine isolate revealed three novel putative toxin genes encoding proteins related to the pore-forming Leukocidin/Hemolysin Superfamily; these were designated netE, netF, and netG. netE and netF were located on one large conjugative plasmid, and netG was located with a cpe enterotoxin gene on a second large conjugative plasmid. Mutation and complementation showed that only netF was associated with the cytotoxicity. Although netE and netG were not associated with cytotoxicity, immunoblotting with specific antisera showed these proteins to be expressed in vitro. There was a highly significant association between the presence of netF with type A strains isolated from cases of canine acute hemorrhagic gastroenteritis and foal necrotizing enterocolitis. netE and netF were found in all cytotoxic isolates, as was cpe, but netG was less consistently present. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis showed that netF-positive isolates belonged to a clonal population; some canine and equine netF-positive isolates were genetically indistinguishable. Equine antisera to recombinant Net proteins showed that only antiserum to rNetF had high supernatant cytotoxin neutralizing activity. The identifica-tion of this novel necrotizing toxin is an important advance in understanding the virulence of type A C. perfringens in specific enteric disease of animals."

The N1 and N4 rVSV vectors described in this manuscript are the subject of patents licensed to Profectus BioSciences, Inc. Opinions, interpretations, conclusions, and recommendations are those of the authors and are not necessarily endorsed by the University of Texas Medical Branch. Two variants of the recently developed VesiculoVax recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV)-based Ebola vaccine have been tested for their ability to protect cynomolgus monkeys against heterologous challenge with the new outbreak strain of Ebola virus. Animals received a single injection of either N4CT1 or N1CT1 VesiculoVax and were exposed to a high dose of Ebola four weeks later. None of the vaccinated animals developed illness and all survived. This works raises the prospect that second-generation vaccines may have fewer safety concerns than the first-generation vaccines currently in use in the field. The family Filoviridae contains three genera, Ebolavirus (EBOV), Marburg virus, and Cuevavirus1. Some members of the EBOV genus, including Zaire ebolavirus (ZEBOV), can cause lethal haemorrhagic fever in humans. During 2014 an unprecedented ZEBOV outbreak occurred in West Africa and is still ongoing, resulting in over 10,000 deaths, and causing global concern of uncontrolled disease. To meet this challenge a rapid-acting vaccine is needed. Many vaccine approaches have shown promise in being able to protect nonhuman primates against ZEBOV2. In response to the current ZEBOV outbreak several of these vaccines have been fast tracked for human use. However, it is not known whether any of these vaccines can provide protection against the new outbreak Makona strain of ZEBOV. One of these approaches is a first-generation recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (rVSV)-based vaccine expressing the ZEBOV glycoprotein (GP) (rVSV/ZEBOV). To address safety concerns associated with this vector, we developed two candidate, further-attenuated rVSV/ZEBOV vaccines. Both attenuated vaccines produced an approximately tenfold lower vaccine-associated viraemia compared to the first-generation vaccine and both provided complete, single-dose protection of macaques from lethal challenge with the Makona outbreak strain of ZEBOV."
https://openalex.org/W1971106254,"To assess social inequalities in the use of antenatal care (ANC), facility based delivery (FBD), and modern contraception (MC) in two contrasting groups of countries in sub-Saharan Africa divided based on their progress towards maternal mortality reduction. Six countries were included in this study. Three countries (Ethiopia, Madagascar, and Uganda) had <350 MMR in 2010 with >4.5% average annual reduction rate while another three (Cameroon, Zambia, and Zimbabwe) had >550 MMR in 2010 with only <1.5% average annual reduction rate. All of these countries had at least three rounds of Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) before 2012. We measured rate ratios and differences, as well as relative and absolute concentration indices in order to examine within-country geographical and wealth-based inequalities in the utilization of ANC, FBD, and MC. In the countries which have made sufficient progress (i.e. Ethiopia, Madagascar, and Uganda), ANC use increased by 8.7, 9.3 and 5.7 percent, respectively, while the utilization of FBD increased by 4.7, 0.7 and 20.2 percent, respectively, over the last decade. By contrast, utilization of these services either plateaued or decreased in countries which did not make progress towards reducing maternal mortality, with the exception of Cameroon. Utilization of MC increased in all six countries but remained very low, with a high of 40.5% in Zimbabwe and low of 16.1% in Cameroon as of 2011. In general, relative measures of inequalities were found to have declined overtime in countries making progress towards reducing maternal mortality. In countries with insufficient progress towards maternal mortality reduction, these indicators remained stagnant or increased. Absolute measures for geographical and wealth-based inequalities remained high invariably in all six countries. The increasing trend in the utilization of maternal care services was found to concur with a steady decline in maternal mortality. Relative inequality declined overtime in countries which made progress towards reducing maternal mortality."

In this cross-sectional, observational study we aimed to assess whether neuropathy occurred in patients with type 1 diabetes, without retinopathy or microalbuminuria.All participants underwent detailed assessment of peripheral neuropathy [neuropathy disability score (NDS), vibration perception threshold (VPT), peroneal motor nerve conduction velocity (PMNCV), sural sensory nerve conduction velocity (SSNCV) and in vivo corneal confocal microscopy (IVCCM)], retinopathy (digital fundus photography) and albuminuria status [albumin: creatinine ratio (ACR)].53 patients with Type 1 diabetes with (n=37) and without retinopathy (n=16) were compared to control subjects (n=27). SSNCV, corneal nerve fibre (CNFD) and branch (CNBD) density and length (CNFL) were reduced significantly (p<0.001) in diabetic patients without retinopathy compared to control subjects. Furthermore, CNFD, CNBD and CNFL were also significantly (p<0.001) reduced in diabetic patients without microalbuminuria (n=39), compared to control subjects. Greater neuropathic severity was associated with established retinopathy and microalbuminuria.IVCCM detects early small fibre damage in the absence of retinopathy or microalbuminuria in patients with Type 1 diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W2039380629,"Nowadays molecular species delimitation methods promote the identification of species boundaries within complex taxonomic groups by adopting innovative species concepts and theories (e.g. branching patterns, coalescence). As some of them can efficiently deal with large single-locus datasets, they could speed up the process of species discovery compared to more time consuming molecular methods, and benefit from the existence of large public datasets; these methods can also particularly favour scientific research and actions dealing with threatened or economically important taxa. In this study we aim to investigate and clarify the status of economically important moths species belonging to the genus Spodoptera (Lepidoptera, Noctuidae), a complex group in which previous phylogenetic analyses and integrative approaches already suggested the possible occurrence of cryptic species and taxonomic ambiguities. In this work, the effectiveness of innovative (and faster) species delimitation approaches to infer putative species boundaries has been successfully tested in Spodoptera, by processing the most comprehensive dataset (in terms of number of species and specimens) ever achieved; results are congruent and reliable, irrespective of the set of parameters and phylogenetic models applied. Our analyses confirm the existence of three potential new species clusters (for S. exigua (Hübner, 1808), S. frugiperda (J.E. Smith, 1797) and S. mauritia (Boisduval, 1833)) and support the synonymy of S. marima (Schaus, 1904) with S. ornithogalli (Guenée, 1852). They also highlight the ambiguity of the status of S. cosmiodes (Walker, 1858) and S. descoinsi Lalanne-Cassou & Silvain, 1994. This case study highlights the interest of molecular species delimitation methods as valuable tools for species discovery and to emphasize taxonomic ambiguities."
https://openalex.org/W2041375175,"Background Hypertension is the leading cause of death in developed countries and reduction of salt intake is recommended as a key preventive measure. Objective To assess the dietary sodium and potassium intakes in a national sample of Italian children and adolescents and to examine their relationships with BMI and blood pressure (BP) in the framework of the MINISAL survey, a program supported by the Italian Ministry of Health. Population and Methods The study population included 1424 healthy subjects (766 boys, 658 girls) aged 6-18 years (mean age: 10.1±2.9) who were consecutively recruited in participating National Health Service centers in 10 Italian regions. Electrolyte intake was estimated from 24 hour urine collections tested for completeness by the concomitant measurement of creatinine content. Anthropometric indices and BP were measured with standardized procedures. Results The average estimated sodium intake was 129 mmol (7.4 g of salt) per day among boys and 117 mmol (6.7 g of salt) among girls. Ninety-three percent of the boys and 89% of the girls had a consumption higher than the recommended age-specific standard dietary target. The estimated average daily potassium intakes were 39 mmol (1.53 g) and 36 mmol (1.40 g), respectively, over 96% of the boys and 98% of the girls having a potassium intake lower than the recommended adequate intake. The mean sodium/potassium ratio was similar among boys and girls (3.5 and 3.4, respectively) and over 3-fold greater than the desirable level. Sodium intake was directly related to age, body mass and BP in the whole population. Conclusions The Italian pediatric population is characterized by excessive sodium and deficient potassium intake. These data suggest that future campaigns should focus on children and adolescents as a major target in the framework of a population strategy of cardiovascular prevention."
https://openalex.org/W2159871990,"Background Neisseria meningitidis (Nm) is a leading causative agent of bacterial meningitis in humans. Traditionally, meningococcal meningitis has been diagnosed by bacterial culture. However, isolation of bacteria from patients’ cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is time consuming and sometimes yields negative results. Recently, polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based diagnostic methods of detecting Nm have been considered the gold standard because of their superior sensitivity and specificity compared with culture. In this study, we developed a loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) method and evaluated its ability to detect Nm in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Methodology/Principal Findings We developed a meningococcal LAMP assay (Nm LAMP) that targets the ctrA gene. The primer specificity was validated using 16 strains of N. meningitidis (serogroup A, B, C, D, 29-E, W-135, X, Y, and Z) and 19 non-N. meningitidis species. Within 60 min, the Nm LAMP detected down to ten copies per reaction with sensitivity 1000-fold more than that of conventional PCR. The LAMP assays were evaluated using a set of 1574 randomly selected CSF specimens from children with suspected meningitis collected between 1998 and 2002 in Vietnam, China, and Korea. The LAMP method was shown to be more sensitive than PCR methods for CSF samples (31 CSF samples were positive by LAMP vs. 25 by PCR). The detection rate of the LAMP method was substantially higher than that of the PCR method. In a comparative analysis of the PCR and LAMP assays, the clinical sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of the LAMP assay were 100%, 99.6%, 80.6%, and 100%, respectively. Conclusions/Significance Compared to PCR, LAMP detected Nm with higher analytical and clinical sensitivity. This sensitive and specific LAMP method offers significant advantages for screening patients on a population basis and for diagnosis in clinical settings."
https://openalex.org/W2257401992,"The zinc transporter ZnT2 (SLC30A2) imports zinc into vesicles in secreting mammary epithelial cells (MECs) and is critical for zinc efflux into milk during lactation. Recent studies show that ZnT2 also imports zinc into mitochondria and is expressed in the non-lactating mammary gland and non-secreting MECs, highlighting the importance of ZnT2 in general mammary gland biology. In this study we used nulliparous and lactating ZnT2-null mice and characterized the consequences on mammary gland development, function during lactation, and milk composition. We found that ZnT2 was primarily expressed in MECs and to a limited extent in macrophages in the nulliparous mammary gland and loss of ZnT2 impaired mammary expansion during development. Secondly, we found that lactating ZnT2-null mice had substantial defects in mammary gland architecture and MEC function during secretion, including fewer, condensed and disorganized alveoli, impaired Stat5 activation, and unpolarized MECs. Loss of ZnT2 led to reduced milk volume and milk containing less protein, fat, and lactose compared with wild-type littermates, implicating ZnT2 in the regulation of mammary differentiation and optimal milk production during lactation. Together, these results demonstrate that ZnT2-mediated zinc transport is critical for mammary gland function, suggesting that defects in ZnT2 not only reduce milk zinc concentration but may compromise breast health and increase the risk for lactation insufficiency in lactating women.Background: ZnT2 is expressed in non-secreting and secreting mammary epithelium; however, the physiological role is not understood.Results: ZnT2-null mice have impaired mammary expansion and compromised mammary differentiation and milk secretion during lactation.Conclusion: ZnT2-mediated zinc transport is critical for mammary development and function during lactation.Significance: This study identifies novel consequences of ZnT2 function in the mammary gland.

https://openalex.org/W2022802872,"Autochthonous cases of American cutaneous leishmaniasis (ACL) have been reported since 2001 in the Xakriabá Indigenous Reserve located in the municipality of São João das Missões in northern Minas Gerais state, Brazil. In order to study the presence of Leishmania DNA in phlebotomine sand flies, six entomological collections were carried out from July 2008 through July 2009, using 40 light traps placed in peridomicile areas of 20 randomly selected houses. From October 2011 through August 2012, another six collections were carried out with 20 light traps distributed among four trails (five traps per trail) selected for a previous study of wild and synanthropic hosts of Leishmania. A total of 4,760 phlebotomine specimens were collected belonging to ten genera and twenty-three species. Single female specimens or pools with up to ten specimens of the same locality, species and date, for Leishmania detection by molecular methods. Species identification of parasites was performed with ITS1 PCR-RFLP using HaeIII enzyme and genetic sequencing for SSU rRNA target. The presence of Leishmania DNA was detected in eleven samples from peridomicile areas: Lu. longipalpis (two), Nyssomyia intermedia (four), Lu. renei (two), Lu. ischnacantha, Micropygomyia goiana and Evandromyia lenti (one pool of each specie). The presence of Leishmania DNA was detected in twelve samples from among the trails: Martinsmyia minasensis (six), Ny. intermedia (three), Mi. peresi (two) and Ev. lenti (one). The presence of Leishmania infantum DNA in Lu. longipalpis and Leishmania braziliensis DNA in Ny. intermediasupport the epidemiological importance of these species of sand flies in the cycle of visceral and cutaneous leishmaniasis, respectively. The results also found other species associated with Leishmania DNA, such as Mt. minasensis and Ev. lenti, which may participate in a wild and/or synanthropic cycle of Leishmania transmission in the studied area."
https://openalex.org/W2028778538,"Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is a non-heritable factor that associates with multiple sclerosis (MS). However its causal relationship with the disease is still unclear. The virus establishes a complex co-existence with the host that includes regulatory influences on gene expression. Hence, if EBV contributes to the pathogenesis of MS it may do so by interacting with disease predisposing genes. To verify this hypothesis we evaluated EBV nuclear antigen 2 (EBNA2, a protein that recent works by our and other groups have implicated in disease development) binding inside MS associated genomic intervals. We found that EBNA2 binding occurs within MS susceptibility sites more than expected by chance (factor of observed vs expected overlap [O/E] = 5.392-fold, p < 2.0e-05). This remains significant after controlling for multiple genomic confounders. We then asked whether this observation is significant per se or should also be viewed in the context of other disease relevant gene-environment interactions, such as those attributable to vitamin D. We therefore verified the overlap between EBNA2 genomic occupancy and vitamin D receptor (VDR) binding sites. EBNA2 shows a striking overlap with VDR binding sites (O/E = 96.16-fold, p < 2.0e-05), even after controlling for the chromatin accessibility state of shared regions (p <0.001). Furthermore, MS susceptibility regions are preferentially targeted by both EBNA2 and VDR than by EBNA2 alone (enrichment difference = 1.722-fold, p = 0.0267). Taken together, these findings demonstrate that EBV participates in the gene-environment interactions that predispose to MS."
https://openalex.org/W2032193991,"The F-ATPase in bovine mitochondria is a membrane-bound complex of about 30 subunits of 18 different kinds. Currently, ∼85% of its structure is known. The enzyme has a membrane extrinsic catalytic domain, and a membrane intrinsic domain where the turning of the enzyme's rotor is generated from the transmembrane proton-motive force. The domains are linked by central and peripheral stalks. The central stalk and a hydrophobic ring of c-subunits in the membrane domain constitute the enzyme's rotor. The external surface of the catalytic domain and membrane subunit a are linked by the peripheral stalk, holding them static relative to the rotor. The membrane domain contains six additional subunits named ATP8, e, f, g, DAPIT (diabetes-associated protein in insulin-sensitive tissues), and 6.8PL (6.8-kDa proteolipid), each with a single predicted transmembrane α-helix, but their orientation and topography are unknown. Mutations in ATP8 uncouple the enzyme and interfere with its assembly, but its roles and the roles of the other five subunits are largely unknown. We have reacted accessible amino groups in the enzyme with bifunctional cross-linking agents and identified the linked residues. Cross-links involving the supernumerary subunits, where the structures are not known, show that the C terminus of ATP8 extends ∼70 Å from the membrane into the peripheral stalk and that the N termini of the other supernumerary subunits are on the same side of the membrane, probably in the mitochondrial matrix. These experiments contribute significantly toward building up a complete structural picture of the F-ATPase."
https://openalex.org/W1970903730,"Background Currently, natural products have built a well-recognized role in the management of many degenerative diseases, mainly rheumatoid arthritis. Recent studies suggest that Spirulina, a unicellular blue-green alga, may have a variety of health benefits and curative properties and is also competent of acting as an anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and recently anti-angiogenic agent. In the present study, the antioxidant and the immunomodulatory effect of Spirulina platensis as well as its anti-angiogenic effect against complete Freund's adjuvant-induced arthritis (AIA) in rat model were tested. Results We found that the development of arthritis was concealed; moreover it successfully inhibited the development of macroscopic as well as microscopic and histopathological lesions in AIA rats when compared to control. Spirulina treated group showed a higher survival rate and moreover, it reduced the clinical score of RA in a dose dependent manner. Furthermore, Spirulina decreased serum levels of COX-2, TNF-α, IL-6, TBARS, VEGF and increased serum levels of GSH compared to the RA non-treated group. Conclusions The present study concluded that Spirulina is able to restrain the changes produced through adjuvant-induced arthritis. The suppressing effect of Spirulina could be attributed, at least in part, to anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and anti-angiogenic properties."

https://openalex.org/W1965469192,"Hyperproinsulinemia is an indicator of β-cell dysfunction, and fasting proinsulin levels are elevated in patients with hyperglycemia. It is not known whether proinsulin levels after a glucose load are better predictors of hyperglycemia and type 2 diabetes than fasting proinsulin.Participants were 9,396 Finnish men (mean±SD, age 57.3±7.1 years, BMI 27.0±4.0 kg/m2) of the population-based METabolic Syndrome In Men Study who were non-diabetic at the recruitment, and who participated in a 6-year follow-up study. Proinsulin and insulin levels were measured in the fasting state and 30 and 120 min after an oral glucose load. Area under the curve (AUC) and proinsulin to insulin ratios were calculated.Fasting proinsulin, proinsulin at 30 min and proinsulin AUC during the first 30 min of an oral glucose tolerance test significantly predicted both the worsening of hyperglycemia and type 2 diabetes after adjustment for confounding factors. Further adjustment for insulin sensitivity (Matsuda index) or insulin secretion (Disposition index) weakened these associations. Insulin sensitivity had a major impact on these associations.Our results suggest that proinsulin in the fasting state and after an oral glucose load similarly predict the worsening of hyperglycemia and conversion to type 2 diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W2027309010,"Loss of expression of surface antigens represents a significant problem for cancer immunotherapy. Microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF-M) regulates melanocyte fate by driving expression of many differentiation genes, whose protein products can be recognized by cytolytic T lymphocytes. We previously reported that interleukin-1ß (IL-1ß) can downregulate MITF-M levels. Here we show that downregulation of MITF-M expression by IL-1ß was paralleled by an upregulation of miR-155 expression in four melanoma lines. We confirmed that miR-155 was able to target endogenous MITF-M in melanoma cells and demonstrated a role for miR-155 in the IL-1ß-induced repression of MITF-M by using an antagomiR. Notably, we also observed a strong negative correlation between MITF-M and miR-155 levels in a mouse model of melanoma. Taken together, our results indicate that MITF-M downregulation by inflammatory stimuli might be partly due to miR-155 upregulation. This could represent a novel mechanism of melanoma immune escape in an inflammatory microenvironment."
https://openalex.org/W2048714934,"Studying the response of islet cells to glucose stimulation is important for understanding cell function in healthy and disease states. Most functional assays are performed on whole islets or cell populations, resulting in averaged observations and loss of information at the single cell level. We demonstrate methods to examine calcium fluxing in individual cells of intact islets in response to multiple glucose challenges. Wild-type mouse islets predominantly contained cells that responded to three (out of three) sequential high glucose challenges, whereas cells of diabetic islets (db/db or NOD) responded less frequently or not at all. Imaged islets were also immunostained for endocrine markers to associate the calcium flux profile of individual cells with gene expression. Wild-type mouse islet cells that robustly fluxed calcium expressed β cell markers (INS/NKX6.1), whereas islet cells that inversely fluxed at low glucose expressed α cell markers (GCG). Diabetic mouse islets showed a higher proportion of dysfunctional β cells that responded poorly to glucose challenges. Most of the failed calcium influx responses in β cells were observed in the second and third high glucose challenges, emphasizing the importance of multiple sequential glucose challenges for assessing the full function of islet cells. Human islet cells were also assessed and showed functional α and β cells. This approach to analyze islet responses to multiple glucose challenges in correlation with gene expression assays expands the understanding of β cell function and the diseased state."
https://openalex.org/W2063880927,"Background There is large gap in mental illness treatment globally and potentially especially so in war-affected populations. The study aim was to examine health care utilization patterns for mental, behavioural and emotional problems among the war-affected adult population in the Republic of Georgia. Methods A cross-sectional household survey was conducted among 3600 adults affected by 1990s and 2008 armed conflicts in Georgia. Service use was measured for the last 12 months for any mental, emotional or behavioural problems. TSQ, PHQ-9 and GAD-7 were used to measure current symptoms of PTSD, depression and anxiety. Descriptive and regression analyses were used. Results Respondents were predominantly female (65.0%), 35.8% were unemployed, and 56.0% covered by the government insurance scheme. From the total sample, 30.5% had symptoms of at least one current mental disorder. Among them, 39.0% sought care for mental problems, while 33.1% expressed facing barriers to accessing care and so did not seek care. General practitioners (29%) and neurologists (26%) were consulted by the majority of those with a current mental disorder who accessed services, while use of psychiatric services was far more limited. Pharmacotherapy was the predominant type of care (90%). Female gender (OR 1.50, 95% CI: 1.25, 1.80), middle-age (OR 1.83, 95% CI: 1.48, 2.26) and older-age (OR 1.62, 95% CI: 1.19, 2.21), possession of the state insurance coverage (OR 1.55, 95% CI: 1.30, 1.86), current PTSD symptoms (OR 1.56, 95% CI: 1.29, 1.90) and depression (OR 2.12, 95% CI: 1.70, 2.65) were associated with higher rates of health service utilization, while employed were less likely to use services (OR 0.71, 95% CI: 0.55, 0.89). Conclusions Reducing financial access barriers and increasing awareness and access to local care required to help reduce the burden of mental disorders among conflict-affected persons in Georgia."
https://openalex.org/W2323395768,"Transforming growth factor-beta-induced protein (TGFBIp) is ubiquitously expressed in the extracellular matrix (ECM) of various tissues and cell lines. Progressive accumulation of mutant TGFBIp is directly involved in the pathogenesis of TGFBI-linked corneal dystrophy. Recent studies reported that mutant TGFBIp accumulates in cells; however, the trafficking of TGFBIp is poorly understood. Therefore, we investigated TGFBIp trafficking to determine the route of its internalization and secretion and to elucidate its roles in the pathogenesis of granular corneal dystrophy type 2 (GCD2). Our data indicate that newly synthesized TGFBIp was secreted via the endoplasmic reticulum/Golgi-dependent secretory pathway, and this secretion was delayed in the corneal fibroblasts of patients with GCD2. We also found that TGFBIp was internalized by caveolae-mediated endocytosis, and the internalized TGFBIp accumulated after treatment with bafilomycin A1, an inhibitor of lysosomal degradation. In addition, the proteasome inhibitor MG132 inhibits the endocytosis of TGFBIp. Co-immunoprecipitation revealed that TGFBIp interacted with integrin αVβ3. Moreover, treatment with arginine-glycine-aspartic acid (RGD) tripeptide suppressed the internalization of TGFBIp. These insights on TGFBIp trafficking could lead to the identification of novel targets and the development of new therapies for TGFBI-linked corneal dystrophy."
https://openalex.org/W1983124068,"Ganglioside GD2 is highly expressed on neuroectodermal tumors and an attractive therapeutic target for antibodies that have already shown some clinical efficacy. To further improve the current antibodies, which have modest affinity, we sought to improve affinity by using a combined method of random mutagenesis and in silico assisted design to affinity-mature the anti-GD2 monoclonal antibody hu3F8. Using yeast display, mutants in the Fv with enhanced binding over the parental clone were FACS-sorted and cloned. In silico modeling identified the minimal key interacting residues involved in the important charged interactions with the sialic acid groups of GD2. Two mutations, D32H (L-CDR1) and E1K (L-FR1) altered the electrostatic surface potential of the antigen binding site, allowing for an increase in positive charge to enhance the interaction with the negatively charged GD2-pentasaccharide headgroup. Purified scFv and IgG mutant forms were then tested for antigen specificity by ELISA, for tissue specificity by immunohistochemistry, for affinity by BIACORE, for antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) and complement-mediated cytotoxicity in vitro, and for anti-tumor efficacy in xenografted humanized mice. The nearly 7-fold improvement in affinity of hu3F8 with a single D32H (L-CDR1) mutation translated into a ∼12-fold improvement in NK92MI-transfected CD16-mediated ADCC, a 6-fold improvement in CD32-mediated ADCC, and a 2.5-fold improvement in complement-mediated cytotoxicity while maintaining restricted normal tissue cross-reactivity and achieving substantial improvement in tumor ablation in vivo. Despite increasing GD2 affinity, the double mutation D32H (L-CDR1) and E1K (L-FR1) did not further improve anti-tumor efficacy.Background: Modest affinity to carbohydrate targets limits the therapeutic efficacy of antibodies to tumor antigens, such as ganglioside GD2.Results: Mutagenesis and in silico modeling were utilized to enhance the affinity of monoclonal antibody hu3F8 to GD2.Conclusion: Alteration of electrostatic surface potential resulted in enhanced affinity and tumor cytotoxicity.Significance: An improved clinical candidate was developed against a carbohydrate tumor antigen. Ganglioside GD2 is highly expressed on neuroectodermal tumors and an attractive therapeutic target for antibodies that have already shown some clinical efficacy. To further improve the current antibodies, which have modest affinity, we sought to improve affinity by using a combined method of random mutagenesis and in silico assisted design to affinity-mature the anti-GD2 monoclonal antibody hu3F8. Using yeast display, mutants in the Fv with enhanced binding over the parental clone were FACS-sorted and cloned. In silico modeling identified the minimal key interacting residues involved in the important charged interactions with the sialic acid groups of GD2. Two mutations, D32H (L-CDR1) and E1K (L-FR1) altered the electrostatic surface potential of the antigen binding site, allowing for an increase in positive charge to enhance the interaction with the negatively charged GD2-pentasaccharide headgroup. Purified scFv and IgG mutant forms were then tested for antigen specificity by ELISA, for tissue specificity by immunohistochemistry, for affinity by BIACORE, for antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) and complement-mediated cytotoxicity in vitro, and for anti-tumor efficacy in xenografted humanized mice. The nearly 7-fold improvement in affinity of hu3F8 with a single D32H (L-CDR1) mutation translated into a ∼12-fold improvement in NK92MI-transfected CD16-mediated ADCC, a 6-fold improvement in CD32-mediated ADCC, and a 2.5-fold improvement in complement-mediated cytotoxicity while maintaining restricted normal tissue cross-reactivity and achieving substantial improvement in tumor ablation in vivo. Despite increasing GD2 affinity, the double mutation D32H (L-CDR1) and E1K (L-FR1) did not further improve anti-tumor efficacy. Background: Modest affinity to carbohydrate targets limits the therapeutic efficacy of antibodies to tumor antigens, such as ganglioside GD2. Results: Mutagenesis and in silico modeling were utilized to enhance the affinity of monoclonal antibody hu3F8 to GD2. Conclusion: Alteration of electrostatic surface potential resulted in enhanced affinity and tumor cytotoxicity. Significance: An improved clinical candidate was developed against a carbohydrate tumor antigen. Gangliosides are sialic acid-containing glycolipids that are widely expressed in stem cells, neurons of the central nervous system, and peripheral nerve endings and represent a special class of targets in cancer immunotherapy (1Fredman P. Hedberg K. Brezicka T. Gangliosides as therapeutic targets for cancer.BioDrugs. 2003; 17: 155-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 2Durrant L.G. Noble P. Spendlove I. Immunology in the clinic review series; focus on cancer: glycolipids as targets for tumour immunotherapy.Clin. Exp. Immunol. 2012; 167: 206-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Ganglioside GD2 is an abundant glycolipid found on neuroectodermal tumors, including neuroblastoma, retinoblastoma, melanoma, small cell lung cancer, brain tumors, osteosarcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, and Ewing sarcoma in children and adolescents, but highly restricted in normal tissues (3Cheung N.K. Dyer M.A. Neuroblastoma: developmental biology, cancer genomics and immunotherapy.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2013; 13: 397-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar). GD2 consists of a pentasaccharide head, which contains two sialic acids, N-acetylgalactosamine, galactose, glucose, and a ceramide tail (4Yu R.K. Tsai Y.T. Ariga T. Yanagisawa M. Structures, biosynthesis, and functions of gangliosides: an overview.J. Oleo Sci. 2011; 60: 537-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Most anti-GD2 antibodies bind to an epitope formed by sialic acids and N-acetylgalactosamine. Glycosyltransferases catalyze the synthesis of GD2 by the sequential addition of simple sugars, including sialic acid, to LacCer. GD3, GD2, GD1b, GT1b, and GQ1b are classified as belonging to the b-series gangliosides (5Chester M.A. IUPAC-IUB Joint Commission on Biochemical Nomenclature (JCBN): nomenclature of glycolipids: recommendations 1997.Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 257: 293-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), whereas GM2 and GT2 are in the a- and c-series, respectively. Because of epitope similarity to GD2 in the synthetic pathways, GD3, GM2, and GD1b are potential cross-reactive epitopes during anti-GD2 antibody development (6Hu J. Huang X. Ling C.C. Bundle D.R.

Two families of therapeutic anti-GD2 antibodies have been developed and tested extensively in patients, namely the mouse immunoglobulin G3 (IgG3) antibody 3F8 (7Cheung N.K. Cheung I.Y. Kushner B.H.

These antibodies have been primarily used in clinical trials for neuroblastoma, a malignancy accounting for 7% of all childhood cancers and 15% of pediatric cancer deaths (12Ahmed M. Cheung N.K. Engineering anti-GD2 monoclonal antibodies for cancer immunotherapy.FEBS Lett. 2014; 588: 288-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The use of anti-GD2 antibodies plus subcutaneous granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) has resulted in substantial increases in the survival time of patients with high-risk stage 4 neuroblastoma (7Cheung N.K. Cheung I.Y. Kushner B.H. Ostrovnaya I. Chamberlain E. Kramer K. Modak S. Murine anti-GD2 monoclonal antibody 3F8 combined with granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor and 13-cis-retinoic acid in high-risk patients with stage 4 neuroblastoma in first remission.J. Clin. Oncol. 2012; 30: 3264-3270Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). The pain side effects, which are thought to be a consequence of complement activation (13Navid F. Santana V.M. Barfield R.C. Anti-GD2 antibody therapy for GD2-expressing tumors.Curr. Cancer Drug Targets. 2010; 10: 200-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), have limited the dose of anti-GD2 antibody and the efficacy on ablating bulky tumors. Murine 3F8 (m3F8), with a moderate affinity for GD2 (KD = 5 nm), was the first anti-GD2 antibody agent to be tested in patients (14Cheung N.K. Lazarus H. Miraldi F.D. Abramowsky C.R. Kallick S. Saarinen U.M. Spitzer T. Strandjord S.E. Coccia P.F. Berger N.A. Ganglioside GD2 specific monoclonal antibody 3F8: a phase I study in patients with neuroblastoma and malignant melanoma.J. Clin. Oncol. 1987; 5: 1430-1440Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). hu3F8 has affinity comparable with that of m3F8 and has shown low immunogenicity, despite repeated cycles in patients previously sensitized to m3F8 (8Cheung N.K. Guo H. Hu J. Tassev D.V. Cheung I.Y. Humanizing murine IgG3 anti-GD2 antibody m3F8 substantially improves antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity while retaining targeting in vivo.Oncoimmunology. 2012; 1: 477-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). It is often assumed for high-density antigens (e.g. GD2) that affinity may not be as important, hence the typical IgM response against such antigens. We hypothesize that affinity maturation can enhance antibody binding to GD2 that translates into improved biologic functions. antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity complementarity-determining region complement-mediated cytotoxicity peripheral blood mononuclear cell framework region. A variety of in vitro evolution strategies have proven useful to improve the affinity and specificity of antibodies obtained by display technologies (15Bradbury A.R. Sidhu S. Dübel S. McCafferty J. Beyond natural antibodies: the power of in vitro display technologies.Nat. Biotechnol. 2011; 29: 245-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). These strategies rely on either site-directed mutagenesis of the complementary-determining region (CDR) (16Garcia-Rodriguez C. Levy R. Arndt J.W. Forsyth C.M. Razai A. Lou J. Geren I. Stevens R.C.

One of its advantages is the quantitative screening through the use of fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) (21Boder E.T. Raeeszadeh-Sarmazdeh M. Price J.V. Engineering antibodies by yeast display.Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2012; 526: 99-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). However, it remains quite difficult to deduce which of the CDR residues directly interact with the antigen. As a rule, during in vitro affinity maturation, substituted residues involve not only the contact residues but also residues located in the periphery of the paratope (22Valjakka J. Hemminki A. Niemi S. Söderlund H. Takkinen K. Rouvinen J. Crystal structure of an in vitro affinity- and specificity-matured anti-testosterone Fab in complex with testosterone. Improved affinity results from small structural changes within the variable domains.J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44021-44027Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). However, this maturation process can be accelerated by deducing the contact residues based on antibody structures or, preferably, if antibody-antigen complex structures are available (23Inoue H. Suganami A. Ishida I. Tamura Y. Maeda Y. Affinity maturation of a CDR3-grafted VHH using in silico analysis and surface plasmon resonance.J.

Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 9029-9034Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Unlike protein antigens, glycans are generally T-cell-independent, and therefore low-affinity IgM antibodies are often produced (25Heimburg-Molinaro J. Rittenhouse-Olson K. Development and characterization of antibodies to carbohydrate antigens.Methods Mol. Biol. 2009; 534: 341-357PubMed Google Scholar). Affinity maturation of carbohydrate-specific antibodies without the loss of specificity has been attempted by incorporating limited point mutations (6Hu J. Huang X. Ling C.C. Bundle D.R. Cheung N.K. Reducing epitope spread during affinity maturation of an anti-ganglioside GD2 antibody.J. Immunol. 2009; 183: 5748-5755Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 26Thomas R. Patenaude S.I. MacKenzie C.R. To R. Hirama T. Young N.M. Evans S.V. Structure of an anti-blood group A Fv and improvement of its binding affinity without loss of specificity.J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2059-2064Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). A hierarchy of cross-reactivity usually accompanies increased binding affinity (6Hu J. Huang X. Ling C.C. Bundle D.R. Cheung N.K. Reducing epitope spread during affinity maturation of an anti-ganglioside GD2 antibody.J. Immunol. 2009; 183: 5748-5755Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), rendering affinity maturation of anti-carbohydrate antibodies more complicated. In the present study, we describe a strategy to improve the affinity and the anti-tumor activity of hu3F8. First, we sequence high-affinity binders from the yeast display of randomized Fv mutations. Potential residues affecting antigen binding were then identified based on the structural modeling of hu3F8. Appropriate hu3F8 variants with limited mutations were designed and tested for antigen binding, tissue immunohistochemistry, ADCC, and complement-mediated cytotoxicity (CMC) in vitro and anti-tumor effect in vivo. This is the first demonstration that anti-GD2 antibodies could be affinity-maturated by the use of yeast display and in silico analysis, achieving high specificity and high potency. GD2-LC-LC-biotin conjugate was obtained from the Consortium for Functional Genomics. For the synthesis of GD2-PEG4-biotin, GD2-azido was conjugated to dibenzocyclooctyne-PEG4-biotin (Click Chemistry Tools) by copper-free azide-alkyne cycloaddition reactions. Briefly, the 100 μg of GD2-azido and 50 μg of dibenzocyclooctyne-PEG4-biotin in 25 μl of water reacted overnight at 4 °C with gentle rotation. On the next day, the excess dibenzocyclooctyne-PEG4-biotin was inactivated by adding 30 μg of azide-PEG3-azide (Click Chemistry Tools) and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. The product was diluted to reach a concentration of 0.5 mg/ml and stored at −80 °C. Random mutagenesis of the entire hu3F8-scFv gene was performed by error-prone PCR with the Stratagene GeneMorph® II random mutagenesis kit as described previously (27Zhao Q. Zhu Z. Dimitrov D.S. Yeast display of engineered antibody domains.Methods Mol. Biol. 2012; 899: 73-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). This introduced limited numbers of mutations into the gene by controlling the quantity of template and the number of PCR cycles. Reaction products were purified and concentrated by an ultrafilter in water for use in the yeast library construction. Site-directed mutagenesis of the hu3F8-scFv gene was performed by PCR using PfuUltra high-fidelity DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Reaction products were digested by DpnI restriction enzyme (New England Biolabs) and then transformed into TOPO10-competent cells. The methodology for generating and isolating higher affinity hu3F8 mutants was adopted from Refs. 27Zhao Q. Zhu Z. Dimitrov D.S. Yeast display of engineered antibody domains.Methods Mol. Biol. 2012; 899: 73-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar and 28Chao G. Lau W.L. Hackel B.J. Sazinsky S.L. Lippow S.M. Wittrup K.D.

Appropriate GD2-PEG4-biotin was conjugated to streptavidin magnetic beads (Invitrogen) with a 1-h incubation at room temperature. Before FACS selection, induced yeast library (1 × 109 cells) was incubated with 10 μg of GD2-conjugated magnetic beads for 1 h at room temperature in PBSA buffer (0.1% BSA in PBS) in the presence of GM2, followed by the separation with a magnetic stand. The isolated beads were washed three times with PBSA buffer, put into 10 ml of SDCAA medium, and grown overnight in a 30 °C shaker with 250 rpm. The recovered yeast cells were induced in SGCAA medium for 18 h at 20 °C with 250 rpm shaking. Approximately 1 × 108 yeast cells were pelleted, washed twice with PBSA buffer, and resuspended in 1 ml of PBSA buffer with biotinylated GD2 and a 1:100 dilution of mouse anti-c-Myc antibody (Invitrogen). After incubation, yeast cells were washed three times and then resuspended in 1 ml of PBSA buffer. 1:100 dilutions of both R-phycoerythrin-conjugated streptavidin (Invitrogen) and Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG antibody (Invitrogen) were added, incubated at 4 °C for 30 min, and washed three times with PBSA buffer for FACS selection. Sorting gates were determined to acquire only 0.1–0.3% population with the highest binding signal. Collected cells were grown overnight in SDCAA medium at 30 °C and induced in SGCAA for the next round of sorting. For the next two selections, ∼1–2 × 107 yeast cells were used for staining with biotinylated GD2. Yeast plasmids were isolated using the Zymoprep Yeast Plasmid Miniprep II Kit (Zymo Research) according to the manufacturer's instructions and used for templates of library construction. Plasmids from the third round were prepared, sequenced, and characterized. The yeast cells displaying hu3F8-scFvs were grown and induced as for flow cytometric analysis. The yeast cells (1 × 106) were incubated with 2 μg/ml biotinylated GD2 and a 1:100 dilution of mouse anti-c-Myc antibody for 30 min on ice in PBSA buffer. After one washing, cells were incubated with a 1:50 dilution of R-phycoerythrin-conjugated streptavidin and Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody for 30 min on ice and then washed again and resuspended in 0.5 ml of PBSA buffer. Analysis was performed using a FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences). Proteins of scFvs were expressed and purified as described previously (29Zhao Q. Chan Y.W. Lee S.S. Cheung W.T. One-step expression and purification of single-chain variable antibody fragment using an improved hexahistidine tag phagemid vector.Protein Expr. Purif. 2009; 68: 190-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) with some modifications. HB2151 cells were transformed with pComb3x plasmid containing scFv sequences. Single fresh colonies were inoculated into 2YT medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 0.2% glucose. The culture was induced by isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (final concentration 0.5 mm). After overnight growth at 30 °C, the bacteria were centrifuged at 3500 × g for 15 min. Soluble proteins were released from periplasm by incubating at 30 °C for 30 min. The clear supernatant was recovered for the purification on a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column. Recombinant scFvs have FLAG and His tags. IgGs were expressed in CHO suspension cells as described previously (8Cheung N.K. Guo H. Hu J. Tassev D.V. Cheung I.Y. Humanizing murine IgG3 anti-GD2 antibody m3F8 substantially improves antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity while retaining targeting in vivo.Oncoimmunology. 2012; 1: 477-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The heavy and light variable regions of hu3F8 variants were cloned into a mammalian expression vector containing human IgG1 constant regions. The vector was transfected into CHO cells and selected with hygromycin B (Life Technologies). The stable cell lines were cultured in OptiCHO serum-free medium (Invitrogen), and the mature supernatant was harvested as described. The soluble IgG1 protein was purified using the Protein A affinity chromatograph medium (GE Healthcare) and subsequently concentrated using ultrafilters (Sartorius Stedim). All antibody samples were purified at >95% monomer by size exclusion HPLC analysis. To test cross-reactivity to gangliosides, GD2, GD1a, GD1b, and GD3 were coated on polyvinyl microtiter plates at 20 ng/well in 90% ethanol. Following air drying, wells were blocked with 0.5% BSA in PBS at 150 μl/well for 1 h at room temperature. Serials of diluted antibodies (100 μl/well) were added with duplicates in 0.5% BSA. Following incubation for 1 h at room temperature and washing with PBS, HRP-goat anti-human Fc antibody (Southern Biotech) at 1:5000 dilution for IgG antibodies or HRP-goat anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma-Aldrich) at 1:5000 dilution for scFv antibodies was added. After incubation for 1 h and further washing, the color reaction was performed, and OD was read using an ELISA plate reader at 490 nm. Kinetics and affinities of various antibodies were analyzed by surface plasmon resonance technology using a Biacore T100 instrument (GE Healthcare). In brief, gangliosides were directly immobilized onto the CM5 sensor chip via hydrophobic interaction. The reference surface was immobilized with GM1. The active surface was immobilized with GD2 and GM1 in a 1:1 ratio or GD1b alone. Diluted mixture of GD2 and GM1 (50 μg/ml) or GD1b was injected (300 μl) at a flow rate of 15 μl/min over 20 min. Extensive washing was followed with 10 mm NaOH (typically five washes of 20 μl at a flow rate of 5 μl/min) until a stable baseline was obtained. The association and dissociation phase data were fitted simultaneously to a 1:1 model by using BIAevaluation version 3.2. LAN-1, M14, and A4573 were obtained from Children's Hospital of Los Angeles; SK-N-CM, SK-E-PR, and SK-E-LP were obtained from Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. All other cell lines were purchased from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) (Manassas, VA). Cells were cultured in RPMI1640 (Cellgro, Manassas, VA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Life Technologies, Inc.) at 37 °C in a 5% CO2-humidified incubator. Assays were done as described previously (8Cheung N.K. Guo H. Hu J. Tassev D.V. Cheung I.Y. Humanizing murine IgG3 anti-GD2 antibody m3F8 substantially improves antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity while retaining targeting in vivo.Oncoimmunology. 2012; 1: 477-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Briefly, tumor cells were radiolabeled with 51Cr. ADCC assays were performed using NK-92MI cells stably transfected with the human Fc receptor or peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) as effectors. The cytotoxicity was calculated by 51Cr release. Tumor cell lines were detached with trypsin-EDTA and washed in culture medium. For cytotoxicity assays, 100 μCi of 51Cr was incubated with 106 target cells in a final volume of 250 μl and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C with gentle resuspension of pellet at 15-min intervals. Cells were then pelleted, washed, and resuspended in media to ∼0.05 million cells/ml. Cells were counted, and viability was determined with trypan blue and quickly plated onto 96-well U-bottom plates. Antibodies were diluted in medium from 10 μg/ml in 10-fold dilutions. For each well, 50 μl of antibody was mixed with 100 μl of target cells and kept on ice for 45 min. 100 μl of blood serum (1:80 dilution of pooled sera) was then added to each well to initiate complement fixation. Plates were incubated in a 37 °C, 5% CO2 incubator for 4 h. Released 51Cr in the ADCC supernatant was collected for γ counting. Total release was determined using 10% SDS, and background spontaneous release was determined with medium only without serum. All animal procedures were performed in compliance with Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee guidelines. Tumor xenografts were established by subcutaneous implantation of neuroblastoma IMR-32 cells mixed with human PBMC into 5–6-week-old BALB-Rag2−/−IL-2R-γc-KO (DKO) immunodeficient mice. Mice were randomized into groups (n = 5) when tumors were 75–100 mm3. 10 or 50 μg doses of antibodies in PBS were administered intravenously twice per week for a total of four doses. An anti-Hud-peptide/HLA-A2 antibody developed at Memorial Sloan Kettering was used as a non-targeting isotype-matched control. Tumor volume (mm3) was measured once per week and was calculated as (length (mm) × width (mm)2)/2. Human tumors and normal tissues were obtained at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center with institutional review board approval. 5–7-μm sections of snap-frozen tissues were fixed in acetone for 30 min at −20 °C. Endogenous biotin-binding activity was blocked by sequential treatment with avidin and biotin (Vector avidin-biotin blocking kit; Invitrogen) for 20 min each. Sections were incubated with 3 μg/ml scFv at room temperature for 1 h. Following washing, sections were incubated with HRP anti-FLAG antibodies for 30 min at room temperature and subsequent incubation with 3,3-diaminobenzidine for 5 min. H&E staining was also performed. Molecular modeling and energy calculations were done using Discovery Studio version 4.1 (Dassault Systems, Waltham, MA). We previously solved the crystal of murine 3F8 to 1.65 Å resolution (Protein Data Bank 3VFG) and created a docked model of bound GD2 using CDOCKER (30Ahmed M. Goldgur Y. Hu J. Guo H.F. Cheung N.K. In silico driven redesign of a clinically relevant antibody for the treatment of GD2 positive tumors.PLoS One. 2013; 8: e63359Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). A structural model of hu3F8-GD2 was generated by using the murine 3F8-GD2 model generated previously as a template using MODELER followed by CHARMm energy minimization on Discovery Studio. Effects of point mutations were calculated from the difference between the folding free energies of the mutated structure and the parental protein. Generalized Born approximation was used to account for the effect of the solvent, and all electrostatic terms were calculated as a sum of coulombic interactions and polar contributions to the solvation energy. A weighted sum of the van der Waals, electrostatic, entropy, and non-polar terms was calculated for each point mutation. Electrostatic surface potentials were generated using DelPhi on Discovery Studio. Additional image renderings were done using PyMOL (Schroedinger, LLC, New York).

https://openalex.org/W2072174205,"Early human societies and their interactions with the natural world have been extensively explored in palaeoenvironmental studies across Central and Western Europe. Yet, despite an extensive body of scholarship, there is little consideration of the environmental impacts of proto-historic urbanisation. Typically palaeoenvironmental studies of Bronze and Iron Age societies discuss human impact in terms of woodland clearance, landscape openness and evidence for agriculture. Although these features are clearly key indicators of human settlement, and characterise Neolithic and early to Middle Bronze Age impacts at Corent, they do not appear to represent defining features of a protohistoric urban environment. The Late Iron Age Gallic Oppidum of Corent is remarkable for the paucity of evidence for agriculture and strong representation of apophytes associated with disturbance. Increased floristic diversity – a phenomenon also observed in more recent urban environments – was also noted. The same, although somewhat more pronounced, patterns are noted for the Late Bronze Age and hint at the possibility of a nascent urban area. High percentages of pollen from non-native trees such as Platanus, Castanea and Juglans in the late Bronze Age and Gallic period also suggest trade and cultural exchange, notably with the Mediterranean world.

https://openalex.org/W2017270020,"Iron overload cardiomyopathy results from iron accumulation in the myocardium that is closely linked to iron-mediated myocardial fibrosis. Salvia miltiorrhiza (SM, also known as Danshen), a traditional Chinese medicinal herb, has been widely used for hundreds of years to treat cardiovascular diseases. Here, we investigated the effect and potential mechanism of SM on myocardial fibrosis induced by chronic iron overload (CIO) in mice. Kunming male mice (8 weeks old) were randomized to six groups of 10 animals each: control (CONT), CIO, low-dose SM (L-SM), high-dose SM (H-SM), verapamil (VRP) and deferoxamine (DFO) groups. Normal saline was injected in the CONT group. Mice in the other five groups were treated with iron dextran at 50 mg/kg per day intraperitoneally for 7 weeks, and those in the latter four groups also received corresponding daily treatments, including 3 g/kg or 6 g/kg of SM, 100 mg/kg of VRP, or 100 mg/kg of DFO. The iron deposition was estimated histologically using Prussian blue staining. Myocardial fibrosis was determined by Masson's trichrome staining and hydroxyproline (Hyp) quantitative assay. Superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity, malondialdehyde (MDA) content and protein expression levels of type I collagen (COL I), type I collagen (COL III), transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) and matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) were analyzed to investigate the mechanisms underlying the effects of SM against iron-overloaded fibrosis. Treatment of chronic iron-overloaded mice with SM dose-dependently reduced iron deposition levels, fibrotic area percentage, Hyp content, expression levels of COL I and COL III, as well as upregulated the expression of TGF- β1 and MMP-9 proteins in the heart. Moreover, SM treatment decreased MDA content and increased SOD activity. In conclusion, SM exerted activities against cardiac fibrosis induced by CIO, which may be attributed to its inhibition of iron deposition, as well as collagen metabolism and oxidative stress."
https://openalex.org/W2027619203,"Objectives To determine the contribution of peripheral blood mononuclear cells’ (PBMCs) HIV DNA levels to HIV-associated dementia (HAD) and non-demented HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND) in chronically HIV-infected adults with long-term viral suppression on combined antiretroviral treatment (cART). Methods Eighty adults with chronic HIV infection on cART (>97% with plasma and CSF HIV RNA <50 copies/mL) were enrolled into a prospective observational cohort and underwent assessments of neurocognition and pre-morbid cognitive ability at two visits 18 months apart. HIV DNA in PBMCs was measured by real-time PCR at the same time-points. Results At baseline, 46% had non-demented HAND; 7.5% had HAD. Neurocognitive decline occurred in 14% and was more likely in those with HAD (p<.03). Low pre-morbid cognitive ability was uniquely associated with HAD (p<.05). Log10 HIV DNA copies were stable between study visits (2.26 vs. 2.22 per 106 PBMC). Baseline HIV DNA levels were higher in those with lower pre-morbid cognitive ability (p<.04), and higher in those with no ART treatment during HIV infection 1st year (p = .03). Baseline HIV DNA was not associated with overall neurocognition. However, % ln HIV DNA change was associated with decline in semantic fluency in unadjusted and adjusted analyses (p = .01-.03), and motor-coordination (p = .02-.12) to a lesser extent. Conclusions PBMC HIV DNA plays a role in HAD pathogenesis, and this is moderated by pre-morbid cognitive ability in the context of long-term viral suppression. While the HIV DNA levels in PBMC are not associated with current non-demented HAND, increasing HIV DNA levels were associated with a decline in neurocognitive functions associated with HAND progression."
https://openalex.org/W2059797149,"Although the five basic taste qualities-sweet, sour, bitter, salty and umami-can be recognized by the respective gustatory system, interactions between these taste qualities are often experienced when food is consumed. Specifically, the umami taste has been investigated in terms of whether it enhances or reduces the other taste modalities. These studies, however, are based on individual perception and not on a molecular level. In this study we investigated umami-sweet taste interactions using umami compounds including monosodium glutamate (MSG), 5'-mononucleotides and glutamyl-dipeptides, glutamate-glutamate (Glu-Glu) and glutamate-aspartic acid (Glu-Asp), in human sweet taste receptor hT1R2/hT1R3-expressing cells. The sensitivity of sucrose to hT1R2/hT1R3 was significantly attenuated by MSG and umami active peptides but not by umami active nucleotides. Inhibition of sweet receptor activation by MSG and glutamyl peptides is obvious when sweet receptors are activated by sweeteners that target the extracellular domain (ECD) of T1R2, such as sucrose and acesulfame K, but not by cyclamate, which interact with the T1R3 transmembrane domain (TMD). Application of umami compounds with lactisole, inhibitory drugs that target T1R3, exerted a more severe inhibitory effect. The inhibition was also observed with F778A sweet receptor mutant, which have the defect in function of T1R3 TMD. These results suggest that umami peptides affect sweet taste receptors and this interaction prevents sweet receptor agonists from binding to the T1R2 ECD in an allosteric manner, not to the T1R3. This is the first report to define the interaction between umami and sweet taste receptors."
https://openalex.org/W2334688876,"Fishways have been developed to restore longitudinal connectivity in rivers. Despite their potential for aiding fish passage, fishways may represent a source of significant energetic expenditure for fish as they are highly turbulent environments. Nonetheless, our understanding of the physiological mechanisms underpinning fishway passage of fish is still limited. We examined swimming behaviour and activity of silver redhorse (Moxostoma anisurum) during its upriver spawning migration in a vertical slot fishway. We used an accelerometer-derived instantaneous activity metric (overall dynamic body acceleration) to estimate location-specific swimming activity. Silver redhorse demonstrated progressive increases in activity during upstream fishway passage. Moreover, location-specific passage duration decreased with an increasing number of passage attempts. Turning basins and the most upstream basin were found to delay fish passage. No relationship was found between basin-specific passage duration and activity and the respective values from previous basins. The results demonstrate that successful fishway passage requires periods of high activity. The resultant energetic expenditure may affect fitness, foraging behaviour and increase susceptibility to predation, compromising population sustainability. This study highlights the need to understand the physiological mechanisms underpinning fishway passage to improve future designs and interpretation of biological evaluations."
https://openalex.org/W2091013335,"The Australian lungfish is a unique living representative of an ancient dipnoan lineage, listed as 'vulnerable' to extinction under Australia's Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999. Historical accounts indicate this species occurred naturally in two adjacent river systems in Australia, the Burnett and Mary. Current day populations in other rivers are thought to have arisen by translocation from these source populations. Early genetic work detected very little variation and so had limited power to answer questions relevant for management including how genetic variation is partitioned within and among sub-populations. In this study, we use newly developed microsatellite markers to examine samples from the Burnett and Mary Rivers, as well as from two populations thought to be of translocated origin, Brisbane and North Pine. We test whether there is significant genetic structure among and within river drainages; assign putatively translocated populations to potential source populations; and estimate effective population sizes. Eleven polymorphic microsatellite loci genotyped in 218 individuals gave an average within-population heterozygosity of 0.39 which is low relative to other threatened taxa and for freshwater fishes in general. Based on FST values (average over loci = 0.11) and STRUCTURE analyses, we identify three distinct populations in the natural range, one in the Burnett and two distinct populations in the Mary. These analyses also support the hypothesis that the Mary River is the likely source of translocated populations in the Brisbane and North Pine rivers, which agrees with historical published records of a translocation event giving rise to these populations. We were unable to obtain bounded estimates of effective population size, as we have too few genotype combinations, although point estimates were low, ranging from 29 - 129. We recommend that, in order to preserve any local adaptation in the three distinct populations that they be managed separately."
https://openalex.org/W1970830254,"Cytochrome c (cyt c) family proteins, such as horse cyt c, Pseudomonas aeruginosa cytochrome c551 (PA cyt c551), and Hydrogenobacter thermophilus cytochrome c552 (HT cyt c552), have been used as model proteins to study the relationship between the protein structure and folding process. We have shown in the past that horse cyt c forms oligomers by domain swapping its C-terminal helix, perturbing the Met–heme coordination significantly compared to the monomer. HT cyt c552 forms dimers by domain swapping the region containing the N-terminal α-helix and heme, where the heme axial His and Met ligands belong to different protomers. Herein, we show that PA cyt c551 also forms domain-swapped dimers by swapping the region containing the N-terminal α-helix and heme. The secondary structures of the M61A mutant of PA cyt c551 were perturbed slightly and its oligomer formation ability decreased compared to that of the wild-type protein, showing that the stability of the protein secondary structures is important for domain swapping. The hinge loop of domain swapping for cyt c family proteins corresponded to the unstable region specified by hydrogen exchange NMR measurements for the monomer, although the swapping region differed among proteins. These results show that the unstable loop region has a tendency to become a hinge loop in domain-swapped proteins."

https://openalex.org/W2041725920,"Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus are commonly associated with hospital-acquired infections and are known to form biofilms. Ciprofloxacin (CIP), which is normally used to treat these infections, is seldom effective in killing cells in a biofilm. This is mostly due to slow or weak penetration of CIP to the core of biofilms. The problem is accentuated by the release of CIP below MIC (minimal inhibitory concentration) levels following a rapid (burst) release. The aim of this study was to develop a drug carrier that would keep CIP above MIC levels for an extended period. Ciprofloxacin was suspended into poly(D,L-lactide) (PDLLA) and poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO), and electrospun into nanofibers (CIP-F). All of the CIP was released from the nanofibers within 2 h, which is typical of a burst release. However, 99% of P. aeruginosa PA01 cells and 91% of S. aureus Xen 30 cells (a methicillin-resistant strain) in biofilms were killed when exposed to CIP-F. CIP levels remained above MIC for 5 days, as shown by growth inhibition of the cells in vitro. The nanofibers were smooth in texture with no bead formation, as revealed by scanning electron and atomic force microscopy. A single vibration peak at 1632 cm-1, recorded with Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, indicated that CIP remained in crystal form when incorporated into PDLLA: PEO. No abnormalities in the histology of MCF-12A breast epithelial cells were observed when exposed to CIP-F. This is the first report of the inhibition of biofilm formation by CIP released from PDLLA: PEO nanofibers."
https://openalex.org/W2059738723,"Social stimuli are known to both attract and direct our attention, but most research on social attention has been conducted in highly controlled laboratory settings lacking in social context. This study examined the role of social context on viewing behaviour of participants whilst they watched a dynamic social scene, under three different conditions. In two social groups, participants believed they were watching a live webcam of other participants. The socially-engaged group believed they would later complete a group task with the people in the video, whilst the non-engaged group believed they would not meet the people in the scene. In a third condition, participants simply free-viewed the same video with the knowledge that it was pre-recorded, with no suggestion of a later interaction. Results demonstrated that the social context in which the stimulus was viewed significantly influenced viewing behaviour. Specifically, participants in the social conditions allocated less visual attention towards the heads of the actors in the scene and followed their gaze less than those in the free-viewing group. These findings suggest that by underestimating the impact of social context in social attention, researchers risk coming to inaccurate conclusions about how we attend to others in the real world."
https://openalex.org/W2089710582,"Understanding single-neuron computations and encoding performed by spike-generation mechanisms of cortical neurons is one of the central challenges for cell electrophysiology and computational neuroscience. An established paradigm to study spike encoding in controlled conditions in vitro uses intracellular injection of a mixture of signals with fluctuating currents that mimic in vivo-like background activity. However this technique has two serious limitations: it uses current injection, while synaptic activation leads to changes of conductance, and current injection is technically most feasible in the soma, while the vast majority of synaptic inputs are located on the dendrites. Recent progress in optogenetics provides an opportunity to circumvent these limitations. Transgenic expression of light-activated ionic channels, such as Channelrhodopsin2 (ChR2), allows induction of controlled conductance changes even in thin distant dendrites. Here we show that photostimulation provides a useful extension of the tools to study neuronal encoding, but it has its own limitations. Optically induced fluctuating currents have a low cutoff (~70Hz), thus limiting the dynamic range of frequency response of cortical neurons. This leads to severe underestimation of the ability of neurons to phase-lock their firing to high frequency components of the input. This limitation could be worked around by using short (2 ms) light stimuli which produce membrane potential responses resembling EPSPs by their fast onset and prolonged decay kinetics. We show that combining application of short light stimuli to different parts of dendritic tree for mimicking distant EPSCs with somatic injection of fluctuating current that mimics fluctuations of membrane potential in vivo, allowed us to study fast encoding of artificial EPSPs photoinduced at different distances from the soma. We conclude that dendritic photostimulation of ChR2 with short light pulses provides a powerful tool to investigate population encoding of simulated synaptic potentials generated in dendrites at different distances from the soma."
https://openalex.org/W1976664885,"Introduction Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a less invasive option for cancer treatment that has evolved through recent developments in nanotechnology. We have designed and synthesized a novel liposome system that includes an indocyanine green (ICG) derivative, ICG-C18, in its bilayer. In addition to its use as an optical imager to visualize blood, lymphatic, and bile flow, ICG has also been used as an optical sensitizer. In the present report, we evaluate the use of our novel liposome system, LP-ICG-C18, in PDT for squamous cell carcinoma in an autologous murine model. Materials and Methods An excitation pulse beam (300 μJ/pulse) of a single band (800 nm) was used for sensitization. The cytotoxicity of the photodynamic therapy was evaluated in terms of cellular morphology changes, methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium (MTT) assay results, and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate-biotin nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining. We tested the enhanced permeability and retention effect of LP-ICG-C18 in tumor-bearing C3H/He mice using a near-infrared fluorescence imaging system and fluorescence microscopy. We also examined the antitumor effect of PDT by measuring tumor volume in tumor-bearing mice. Results Cell death and apoptosis were only observed in the PDT group receiving LP-ICG-C18. LP-ICG-C18 itself had no cytotoxic activity and showed good biocompatibility. LP-ICG-C18 accumulated on the tumor 24 hours after injection and was retained for approximately 3 weeks. Tumor cell apoptosis following PDT with LP-ICG-C18 was also observed under optical microscopy, MTT assay, and TUNEL staining. Conclusion These findings suggest that LP-ICG-C18 may be an effective intervening material in PDT for malignant disease."
https://openalex.org/W2014440069,"Fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) are essential for maintaining self-renewal in human embryonic stem cells and induced pluripotent stem cells. Recombinant basic FGF (bFGF or FGF2) is conventionally used to culture pluripotent stem cells; however, because of the instability of bFGF, repeated addition of fresh bFGF into the culture medium is required in order to maintain its concentration. In this study, we demonstrate that a heat-stable chimeric variant of FGF, termed FGFC, can be successfully used for maintaining human pluripotent stem cells. FGFC is a chimeric protein composed of human FGF1 and FGF2 domains that exhibits higher thermal stability and protease resistance than do both FGF1 and FGF2. Both human embryonic stem cells and induced pluripotent stem cells were maintained in ordinary culture medium containing FGFC instead of FGF2. Comparison of cells grown in FGFC with those grown in conventional FGF2 media showed no significant differences in terms of the expression of pluripotency markers, global gene expression, karyotype, or differentiation potential in the three germ lineages. We therefore propose that FGFC may be an effective alternative to FGF2, for maintenance of human pluripotent stem cells."
https://openalex.org/W1994696619,"The visual wulst of the zebra finch comprises at least two retinotopic maps of the contralateral eye. As yet, it is not known how much of the visual field is represented in the wulst neuronal maps, how the organization of the maps is related to the retinal architecture, and how information from the ipsilateral eye is involved in the activation of the wulst. Here, we have used autofluorescent flavoprotein imaging and classical anatomical methods to investigate such characteristics of the most posterior map of the multiple retinotopic representations. We found that the visual wulst can be activated by visual stimuli from a large part of the visual field of the contralateral eye. Horizontally, the visual field representation extended from -5° beyond the beak tip up to +125° laterally. Vertically, a small strip from -10° below to about +25° above the horizon activated the visual wulst. Although retinal ganglion cells had a much higher density around the fovea and along a strip extending from the fovea towards the beak tip, these areas were not overrepresented in the wulst map. The wulst area activated from the foveal region of the ipsilateral eye, overlapped substantially with the middle of the three contralaterally activated regions in the visual wulst, and partially with the other two. Visual wulst activity evoked by stimulation of the frontal visual field was stronger with contralateral than with binocular stimulation. This confirms earlier electrophysiological studies indicating an inhibitory influence of the activation of the ipsilateral eye on wulst activity elicited by stimulating the contralateral eye. The lack of a foveal overrepresentation suggests that identification of objects may not be the primary task of the zebra finch visual wulst. Instead, this brain area may be involved in the processing of visual information necessary for spatial orientation."
https://openalex.org/W1969978820,"Renal hyperfiltration, which is associated with renal injury, occurs in diabetic or obese individuals. Serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) level is also elevated in patients with diabetes (DM) or metabolic syndrome (MS), and increased urinary excretion of ALP has been demonstrated in patients who have hyperfiltration and tubular damage. However, little was investigated about the association between hyperfiltration and serum ALP level. A retrospective observational study of the 21,308 adults in the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey IV-V databases (2008–2011) was performed. Renal hyperfiltration was defined as exceeding the age- and sex-specific 97.5th percentile. We divided participants into 4 groups according to their estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR): >120, 90–119, 60–89, and <60 mL/min/1.73 m2. The participants with eGFR >120 mL/min/1.73 m2 showed the highest risk for MS, in the highest ALP quartiles (3.848, 95% CI, 1.876–7.892), compared to the lowest quartile. Similarly, the highest risk for DM, in the highest ALP quartiles, was observed in participants with eGFR >120 ml/min/1.73 m2 (2.166, 95% CI, 1.084–4.329). ALP quartiles were significantly associated with albuminuria in participants with eGFR ≥ 60 ml/min/1.73m2. The highest ALP quartile had a 1.631-fold risk elevation for albuminuria with adjustment of age and sex. (95% CI, 1.158-2.297, P = 0.005). After adjustment, the highest ALP quartile had a 1.624-fold risk elevation, for renal hyperfiltration (95% CI, 1.204–2.192, P = 0.002). In addition, hyperfiltration was significantly associated with hemoglobin, triglyceride, white blood cell count, DM, smoking, and alcohol consumption (P<0.05). The relationship between serum ALP and metabolic disorders is stronger in participants with an upper-normal range of eGFR. Higher ALP levels are significantly associated with renal hyperfiltration in Korean general population."

Our in vitro results showed that oseltamivir phosphate impairs sialidase activity leading to increased sialylation in CMA07 and CMT-U27 canine mammary cancer cells. Surprisingly, oseltamivir phosphate stimulated, CMT-U27 cell migration and invasion capacity in vitro, in a dose-dependent manner. CMT-U27 tumors xenograft of oseltamivir phosphate-treated nude mice showed increased sialylation, namely α2,6 terminal structures and SLe(x) expression. Remarkably, a trend towards increased lung metastases was observed in oseltamivir phosphate-treated nude mice. Taken together, our findings revealed that oseltamivir impairs canine mammary cancer cell sialidase activity, altering the sialylation pattern of canine mammary tumors, and leading, surprisingly, to in vitro and in vivo increased mammary tumor aggressiveness."
https://openalex.org/W2050931753,"Many small mammals bask in the sun during rewarming from heterothermy, but the implications of this behaviour for their energy balance remain little understood. Specifically, it remains unclear whether solar radiation supplements endogenous metabolic thermogenesis (i.e., rewarming occurs through the additive effects of internally-produced and external heat), or whether solar radiation reduces the energy required to rewarm by substituting (i.e, replacing) metabolic heat production. To address this question, we examined patterns of torpor and rewarming rates in eastern rock elephant shrews (Elephantulus myurus) housed in outdoor cages with access to either natural levels of solar radiation or levels that were experimentally reduced by means of shade cloth. We also tested whether acclimation to solar radiation availability was manifested via phenotypic flexibility in basal metabolic rate (BMR), non-shivering thermogenesis (NST) capacity and/or summit metabolism (Msum). Rewarming rates varied significantly among treatments, with elephant shrews experiencing natural solar radiation levels rewarming faster than conspecifics experiencing solar radiation levels equivalent to approximately 20% or 40% of natural levels. BMR differed significantly between individuals experiencing natural levels of solar radiation and conspecifics experiencing approximately 20% of natural levels, but no between-treatment difference was evident for NST capacity or Msum. The positive relationship between solar radiation availability and rewarming rate, together with the absence of acclimation in maximum non-shivering and total heat production capacities, suggests that under the conditions of this study solar radiation supplemented rather than substituted metabolic thermogenesis as a source of heat during rewarming from heterothermy."
https://openalex.org/W2014616962,"Background The present study was designed to determine whether the Thinprep plus Papanicolaou stain (Thinprep) method is more sensitive than the Cytospin-coupled Wright-Giemsa (WG) stain (Cytospin) method in diagnosis of leptomeningeal metastasis (LM) from malignant solid tumors in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). We also explored if the Thinprep method could be used in the differential diagnosis of the type of primary tumor cells based on the morphology of tumor cells in CSF samples. Methods The morphological features of tumor cells in fresh CSF samples were analyzed using both methods. The tumor cell detection rates were compared between the two methods. Results Using the Thinprep method, we found that each type of tumor cells in the CSF samples had specific identifiable morphological features linked to their primary cancer origins, such as adenocarcinomas originated from the lungs, breast, and stomach, and lung squamous cell carcinomas, small cell lung cancer, large-cell neuroendocrine lung cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, and malignant melanoma. In a retrospective study with 88 LM patients, cancer cells were detected in 80 out of the 88 CSF samples. In the comparative study with 45 LM patients, the initial detection rate of the Thinprep method was significantly higher than that of the Cytospin method (73.3% vs. 57.8%, P<0.01). The cell morphology was better preserved and subcellular structures were clearer using the Thinprep method, compared to the Cytospin method. Conclusions The Thinprep method is more sensitive and suitable for LM diagnosis in CSF in patients with malignant solid tumors than the Cytospin method. The Thinprep method may facilitate primary tumor detection and help design early treatment regimens for LM patients with tumors of unknown primary origin."

We specify structural equation models for extracting associations between the factors and outcomes for MVC deaths and compute correlation functions of states’ relative geographic and political positions to elucidate the relative contribution of these factors. We find evidence that state-level variation in MVC deaths is associated with time-varying driving volume, alcohol consumption, and legislation. These relationships are modulated by state spatial proximity, whereby neighboring states are found to share similar MVC death rates over the thirty-year observation period. These results support the hypothesis that neighboring states exhibit similar risk and protective characteristics, despite differences in political ideology."

Similar to dexamethasone, MS6 promoted adipocyte development in vitro, whereas MS4 did not. Moreover, neither MS4 nor MS6 activated the Pck1 (Pepck) gene in primary rat hepatocytes. We conclude that modification of the functional groups attached to the D-ring of the hydrocortisone steroid molecule produces compounds with altered structure-function GR agonist activity with decreased impact on insulin secretion and reduced adipogenic potential but with preservation of anti-inflammatory activity. Background: Glucocorticoids impair islet β-cell function via glucocorticoid receptor (GR) activation. Results: Thiobenzothiazole-modified hydrocortisone compounds exhibit anti-inflammatory properties with reduced impact on insulin secretion. Conclusion: Novel glucocorticoids can be engineered to reduce impact on β-cell mass and function. Significance: Improved GR agonists will be beneficial in a variety of clinical settings.

GCs have both anti-inflammatory and metabolic effects (1Kadmiel M. Cidlowski J.A. Glucocorticoid receptor signaling in health and disease.Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2013; 34: 518-530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar). Their main mode of action occurs via binding to the glucocorticoid receptor (GR; NR3C1). Ligand-bound GR translocates from the cytosol to the nucleus, where it functions as a sequence-specific DNA binding transcriptional regulator. Because of the powerful anti-inflammatory actions of GCs, they are often used in a variety of clinical situations (1Kadmiel M. Cidlowski J.A. Glucocorticoid receptor signaling in health and disease.Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2013; 34: 518-530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar). However, the clinical use of glucocorticoids is associated with many untoward side effects, including osteoporosis, Cushing syndrome, adrenal suppression, and diabetes (2Schäcke H. Döcke W.D. Asadullah K. Mechanisms involved in the side effects of glucocorticoids.Pharmacol. Ther. 2002; 96: 23-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (1365) Google Scholar). glucocorticoid glucose-stimulated insulin secretion oxygen consumption rate glucocorticoid receptor glucocorticoid-response element 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium adenylate kinase ultraperformance liquid chromatography dexamethasone hydrocortisone phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase. The most common cause of drug-induced diabetes is clinical administration of GCs, and the incidence of GC-induced diabetes continues to rise (3van Raalte D.H. Diamant M. Steroid diabetes: from mechanism to treatment?.Neth. J. Med. 2014; 72: 62-72PubMed Google Scholar). The distribution of the GR in virtually all tissues provides numerous targets for GC action, including effects in pancreatic β-cells. Overexpression of the GR targeted to pancreatic β-cells impairs insulin secretion (4Delaunay F. Khan A. Cintra A. Davani B. Ling Z.C. Andersson A. Ostenson C.G. Gustafsson J. Efendic S. Okret S. Pancreatic beta cells are important targets for the diabetogenic effects of glucocorticoids.J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 2094-2098Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar), whereas deletion of the GR in pancreatic progenitor cells promotes β-cell mass expansion (5Blondeau B. Sahly I.

Thus, current GCs regulate β-cell development and suppress IL-1β-induced inflammatory signaling responses in pancreatic β-cells (7Burke S.J. Goff M.R. Updegraff B.L. Lu D. Brown P.L. Minkin Jr., S.C. Biggerstaff J.P. Zhao L. Karlstad M.D. Collier J.J.

Gilon P. Henquin J.C. Direct glucocorticoid inhibition of insulin secretion: an in vitro study of dexamethasone effects in mouse islets.J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 414-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar and the present work). IL-1β is a key contributor to islet inflammation in both Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes mellitus, which is linked to increased expression of a number of genes involved in immune cell recruitment, nitric oxide production, and prostaglandin synthesis in pancreatic β-cells (10Padgett L.E.

Chemokines are a major subset of genes induced by inflammatory stimuli, such as IL-1β and palmitate, and probably contribute to immune cell infiltration and alterations in immune cell activity in both Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes mellitus (11Burke S.J.

Thus, therapeutics capable of suppressing inflammatory responses in pancreatic islets with reduced impact on insulin secretion would be extremely valuable. GCs were removed from islet transplant regimens due to their adverse side effects (16Shapiro A.M. Lakey J.R. Ryan E.A. Korbutt G.S. Toth E. Warnock G.L. Kneteman N.M. Rajotte R.V.

Kwa K.A. van Genugten R.E. Tushuizen M.E. Holst J.J. Deacon C.F. Karemaker J.M. Heine R.J. Mari A. Diamant M. Islet-cell dysfunction induced by glucocorticoid treatment: potential role for altered sympathovagal balance?.Metabolism. 2013; 62: 568-577Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). However, if their powerful anti-inflammatory actions could be harnessed without, or with vastly reduced, side effects, this would greatly enhance islet transplantation protocols as well as provide therapeutic benefits in other clinical settings. In an effort to separate salutary effects from side effects, various attempts to produce GR ligands that dissociate transactivation from transrepression properties of the GR have been reported (19Vandevyver S. Dejager L. Tuckermann J. Libert C.

Belvisi M.G. Maps and legends: the quest for dissociated ligands of the glucocorticoid receptor.Pharmacol. Ther. 2012; 134: 54-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). The generation of selective glucocorticoid receptor modulators has included both steroidal and non-steroidal compounds (21Rosen J. Miner J.N. The search for safer glucocorticoid receptor ligands.Endocr. Rev. 2005; 26: 452-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). However, more information is needed before the precise ligand structures, which offer the most beneficial properties as a GR agonist, can be determined. In addition, discovery of the most suitable GR agonist molecule with which to treat a specific pathological condition is an active area of investigation. In this study, we report on two thiobenzothiazole-modified hydrocortisone compounds using mouse, rat, and human pancreatic β-cells. Importantly, we identified a unique steroidal compound (MS4) that had reduced impact on insulin secretion when compared with dexamethasone but retained a potent ability to suppress chemokine production. The MS4 compound could potentially be used to improve islet transplantation protocols as well as to provide therapeutic options for other clinical conditions that require long term glucocorticoid therapy. Culture of 832/13 cells and measurements of insulin secretion have been described (22Hohmeier H.E. Mulder H. Chen G. Henkel-Rieger R. Prentki M. Newgard C.B.

Commun. 2004; 324: 1018-1023Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Rat islets were isolated according to previously published protocols (24Collier J.J. Fueger P.T. Hohmeier H.E. Newgard C.B. Pro- and antiapoptotic proteins regulate apoptosis but do not protect against cytokine-mediated cytotoxicity in rat islets and beta-cell lines.Diabetes. 2006; 55: 1398-1406Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Mouse islets (C57BL6) and human islets (Integrated Islet Distribution Program) were obtained and studied as described previously (25Dai C. Brissova M. Hang Y. Thompson C. Poffenberger G. Shostak A.

Islet-enriched gene expression and glucose-induced insulin secretion in human and mouse islets.Diabetologia. 2012; 55: 707-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Six-point dose-response curves were used to generate EC50 and saturating concentrations of each steroid compound (not shown). Primary hepatocytes from Sprague-Dawley rats were purchased from Triangle Research Labs. All rats were 8–10 weeks old and weighed between 150 and 200 g at the time of the isolation procedure. For GSIS, saturating concentrations of each commercial steroid or mercapto-modified steroid were used as indicated in the figure legends. Two previously reported, yet not fully characterized, thiobenzothiazole-modified hydrocortisone analogues (MS4 and MS6) were synthesized via slight modifications of known methods (26Biju P. McCormick K. Aslanian R. Berlin M. Solomon D. Chapman R. McLeod R. Prelusky D. Eckel S. Kelly G. Natiello M. House A. Fernandez X. Bitar R. Phillips J. Anthes J.

The complete synthetic procedures and chemical characterizations for both molecules are provided in supplemental Fig. 1. 832/13 cells were grown in 24-well plates, followed by exposure to the steroidal compounds as indicated in the figure legends. Viability was assessed using both 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium (MTS) and adenylate kinase (ADK) assays. These procedures have been previously validated using the clonal 832/13 β-cell line (24Collier J.J. Fueger P.T. Hohmeier H.E. Newgard C.B. Pro- and antiapoptotic proteins regulate apoptosis but do not protect against cytokine-mediated cytotoxicity in rat islets and beta-cell lines.Diabetes. 2006; 55: 1398-1406Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). 832/13 cells were grown in 24-well plates to 50% confluence and then transiently transfected with 25 ng of indicated plasmid per well using TransFectin Lipid Reagent (Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Cell lysis, luciferase assays, and normalization to total protein content were carried out as described previously (27Collier J.J. Burke S.J. Eisenhauer M.E. Lu D. Sapp R.C. Frydman C.J.

CCL2 and CCL20 secreted into the media were detected using rat Quantikine (CCL2) or DuoSet (CCL20) ELISA kits from R&D Systems, Inc. (Minneapolis, MN) according to the manufacturer’s suggested protocol. Total RNA isolation, cDNA synthesis, and quantification of mRNA abundance via real-time RT-PCR were described previously (28Burke S.J. Collier J.J.

Medium was changed every 48–72 h. Cells were induced to differentiate by changing the medium to DMEM containing a standard MDI induction mixture of 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 0.5 mm 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, 100 nm dexamethasone or a 100 nm concentration of MS4 or MS6, and 1.7 μm insulin. An Oil Red O stock was prepared as described previously (29Richard A.J. Fuller S. Fedorcenco V. Beyl R. Burris T.P. Mynatt R. Ribnicky D.M. Stephens J.M. Artemisia scoparia enhances adipocyte development and endocrine function in vitro and enhances insulin action in vivo.PLoS One. 2014; 9: e98897Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Cell monolayers were aspirated and rinsed with PBS. Following incubation in a fixative solution (10% formaldehyde in PBS) for 10–15 min, the monolayers were rinsed under tap water. The remaining water was aspirated, and the cells were incubated for 1 h in the working Oil Red O solution (0.3% in isopropyl alcohol). Following incubation, the stain was aspirated, the cells were rinsed under tap water, and then the cells were examined by microscopy and scanned to produce data images. 832/13 cells were grown in 15-cm dishes until 80% confluent and then cultured overnight in serum-free RPMI 1640 medium containing either DMSO (vehicle control) or dexamethasone. The following day, either 3 or 15 mm [U-13C]glucose was added to a HEPES balanced salt solution (described in Ref. 22Hohmeier H.E. Mulder H. Chen G. Henkel-Rieger R. Prentki M. Newgard C.B. Isolation of INS-1-derived cell lines with robust ATP-sensitive K+ channel-dependent and -independent glucose-stimulated insulin secretion.Diabetes. 2000; 49: 424-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (707) Google Scholar), and the cells were harvested at the time points shown in Fig. 3. For harvesting, cells were washed with cold PBS, pelleted by centrifugation at 250 × g for 5 min, and metabolome-extracted as described (30Yuan J. Bennett B.D. Rabinowitz J.D. Kinetic flux profiling for quantitation of cellular metabolic fluxes.Nat. Protoc. 2008; 3: 1328-1340Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Sample analysis was accomplished with an ultraperformance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometric (UPLC-MS) untargeted metabolomics and flux method adapted from a previous report (31Lu W. Clasquin M.F. Melamud E. Amador-Noguez D. Caudy A.A. Rabinowitz J.D. Metabolomic analysis via reversed-phase ion-pairing liquid chromatography coupled to a stand alone orbitrap mass spectrometer.Anal. Chem. 2010; 82: 3212-3221Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). The LC-MS system consisting of a Dionex Ultimate 3000 UPLC stack equipped with a temperature-controlled column compartment, pump, and autosampler was fitted to a Thermo Scientific Exactive Plus Orbitrap MS. Briefly, the extracted samples were stored at 4 °C in the autosampler before analysis. An aliquot of each (10 μl) was injected onto a Synergi Hydro-RP 100 column (100 × 2.00 mm, 2.5 μm; Phenomenex) maintained at 25 °C. The analytes were eluted from the column with a flow rate of 200 μl/min with Solvent A being 97:3 water/methanol, 10 mm tributylamine, and 15 mm acetic acid and Solvent B as methanol using the following 25-min gradient: t = 0 min, 100% A, 0% B; t = 2.5 min, 100% A, 0% B; t = 5 min, 80% A, 20% B; t = 7.5 min, 80% A, 20% B; t = 13 min, 45% A, 55% B; t = 15.5 min, 5% A, 95% B; t = 18.5 min, 95% A, 5% B; t = 19 min, 100% A, 0% B; t = 25 min, 100% A, 0% B. The eluent was introduced into the MS via an electrospray ionization source. Full scan data were collected in negative ionization mode using the following parameters: spray voltage = 3 kV, nitrogen sheath gas = 10 p.s.i., capillary temperature = 320 °C, AGC target = 3e6, maximum injection time = 100 ms, resolution = 140,000, and a sliding scan window of 85–800 m/z from 0 to 9 min and 110–1000 m/z from 9 to 25 min. Peaks for known metabolites and their 13C isotopomers were chosen and integrated manually using the following criteria for peak identification: exact mass within ±20 ppm (hard cut-off) and retention time within ±4 min (soft cut-off). Peak areas were exported to an Excel sheet as a .csv file for final data analysis. For flux studies, the percentage of each labeled isotopomer was determined for each time point, and fold changes were calculated by adding all isotopomer peak areas together. The samples were randomized before data acquisition. For data processing, the Orbitrap data files (generated by Xcalibur as .RAW) were converted to mzML format2 via the open source msconvert software in ProteoWizard.3 These files were then entered into Maven (also known as mzroll; see Ref. 32Melamud E. Vastag L. Rabinowitz J.D. Metabolomic analysis and visualization engine for LC-MS data.Anal. Chem. 2010; 82: 9818-9826Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar), which was used to automatically align the total ion chromatograms of each sample based on retention times and m/z values. Oxygen consumption rates (OCR) were measured in 832/13 cells using a Seahorse XF24 Analyzer (Seahorse Biosciences, North Billerica, MA). Following overnight incubation with dexamethasone (Dex), medium was removed, cells were rinsed with PBS, and 750 μl of Hepes balanced salt solution with 3 mm glucose was added for a 2-h equilibration phase to mimic established conditions used for glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (22Hohmeier H.E. Mulder H. Chen G. Henkel-Rieger R. Prentki M. Newgard C.B. Isolation of INS-1-derived cell lines with robust ATP-sensitive K+ channel-dependent and -independent glucose-stimulated insulin secretion.Diabetes. 2000; 49: 424-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (707) Google Scholar). Basal OCR at 3 mm glucose was then measured in 6-min intervals for 3 cycles. After baseline was established, changes in OCR were measured in response to serial compound injections designed to yield the following final well concentrations: glucose (15 mm; 6 cycles), oligomycin (0.5 μg/ml; 2 cycles), carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone (2.5 μm; 2 cycles), and antimycin A (10 μm; 2 cycles). One-way analysis of variance followed by Tukey's post-hoc test was performed using Prism version 6.0 software. The structures of several commonly available GCs currently approved for clinical use are shown in Fig. 1A. Hydrocortisone (HC) was examined for its effect on GSIS using 832/13 rat insulinoma cells. There was a 53% decrease in GSIS following an overnight culture in the presence of HC (Fig. 1B). Moreover, there was a 2.5-fold increase in GSIS in the presence of the potentiating agent forskolin that was also blunted in the presence of HC (Fig. 1B). HC also impairs insulin secretion in isolated rat islets (not shown). We next examined several synthetic GCs, including Dex, budesonide, and fluticasone propionate, to potentially identify a compound with improved therapeutic index. We discovered that all of these molecules diminished insulin secretion in both 832/13 cells and isolated rat islets (Fig. 1, C and D). Because the ability of each synthetic GC to impair insulin secretion was similar, we selected Dex for further investigation due to its common usage in a variety of clinical settings. Using 832/13 cells cultured for 18 h in the presence or absence of Dex, we observed a 45% decrease in the baseline OCR (Fig. 2A). Despite a lower basal OCR in the presence of Dex, the addition of high glucose increased the OCR by nearly 2-fold in both DMSO and Dex-treated cells (Fig. 2A). Using sequential injections of oligomycin, carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone, and antimycin A, contributions of ATP-linked respiration, proton leak, and nonmitochondrial respiration to total OCR were measured. Examination of the relative contribution of each of these components to total OCR indicates that the increase in glucose-stimulated OCR preferentially supports ATP synthesis because the percentage of total OCR represented by ATP-linked OCR increased in response from 3 mm glucose to 15 mm glucose, whereas the percentage of total OCR represented by proton leak and nonmitochondrial OCR decreased (Fig. 2B). Moreover, the percentage of total OCR represented by ATP-linked OCR at 15 mm glucose was significantly higher in Dex-treated cells than in DMSO control (50% versus 44% of total OCR), supporting the possibility that, despite lower total OCR, the ability to support respiration linked to ATP generation is preferentially conserved. This contention is also partially supported by findings in Fig. 2C showing that whereas ATP-linked OCR is reduced nearly 30% in response to Dex treatment, both DMSO- and Dex-treated cells are capable of increasing ATP-linked OCR 3-fold in response to 15 mm glucose (Fig. 2C). Alternatively, Dex treatment resulted in significantly greater reductions in proton leak (∼45%; Fig. 2D) and nonmitochondrial OCR (∼50%; Fig. 2E), and the degree of glucose-stimulated induction of oxygen consumption attributed to each of these parameters (40–55% increase for proton leak; 50–75% increase for nonmitochondrial OCR) is less than the 3-fold increase observed for ATP-linked OCR. However, the decreases in proton leak and nonmitochondrial respiration represent a significant reduction in total OCR because collectively these fractions contribute nearly 70% of total OCR in the 3 mm glucose condition and roughly 50% of total OCR in the 15 mm glucose condition (Fig. 2B). Because of the decrease in OCR (Fig. 2), we attempted to identify a defect in metabolism using [U-13C]glucose and mass spectrometry-based kinetic flux profiling (30Yuan J. Bennett B.D. Rabinowitz J.D. Kinetic flux profiling for quantitation of cellular metabolic fluxes.Nat. Protoc. 2008; 3: 1328-1340Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Using this technique, we were able to quantify 118 metabolites in each glucose treatment. Within these 118 metabolites, 24 (20%) and 40 (33%) metabolites showed 13C incorporation in the 3 and 15 mm [U-13C]glucose-treated cells, respectively, with a corresponding disappearance in 12C signal over time. Although glucose-induced changes in metabolite synthesis were readily detected, which is consistent with a previous report (33Lorenz M.A. El Azzouny M.A. Kennedy R.T. Burant C.F.

Chem. 2013; 288: 10923-10935Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), we did not observe an altered concentration and/or turnover rate (i.e. flux) with respect to Dex exposure in the 118 total metabolites analyzed (Fig. 3) (data not shown). Because the observed changes in central carbon metabolism (specifically, glycolysis and TCA cycle) are due to changes in glucose concentration, as seen previously (33Lorenz M.A. El Azzouny M.A. Kennedy R.T.

https://openalex.org/W2076745294,"Large-scale, heteroplasmic and generally pathogenic mtDNA defects (as induced by defective mitochondrial DNA polymerase, clonal mutations or DNA deletions) are known to negatively impact on life span and can result in apoptosis and tissue loss in, e.g., skeletal muscle or reduce learning abilities. The functional impact of homoplasmic specific mtDNA point mutations, e.g., in genes coding for the electron transport chain, however, remains a matter of debate. The present study contributes to this discussion and provides evidence that a single point mutation in complex I of the respiratory chain is associated with impairment of spatial navigation in adolescent (6-month-old) mice, i.e., reduced performance in the Morris Water Maze, which goes along with increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in juvenile mice (3 months) but not at the age of phenotype expression. A point mutation in complex III goes along with only a mild and non-significant negative effect on cognitive performance and no significant changes in ROS production. These findings suggest to also consider the ontogenetic development of phenotypes when studying mtDNA mutations and highlights a possible impact of complex I dysfunction on the emergence of neurological deficits."

Considering this diversity and their brooding reproductive mode (limiting long-distance dispersal), this family may have been present in the Southern Ocean since its inception. However Philobrya and Adacnarca appear only in the Quaternary fossil record of the Antarctic, suggesting a much more recent incursion. Molecular dating provides an independent means of measuring the time of origin and radiation of this poorly known group. Here we present the first combined molecular and morphological investigation of the Philobryidae in the Southern Ocean. Two nuclear loci (18S and 28S) were amplified from 35 Southern Ocean Adacnarca and Philobrya specimens, with a combined sequence length of 2,282 base pairs (bp). Adacnarca specimens (A. nitens and A. limopsoides) were resolved as a strongly supported monophyletic group. Genus Philobrya fell into two strongly supported groups (‘sublaevis’ and ‘magellanica/wandelensis’), paraphyletic with Adacnarca. The A. nitens species complex is identified as at least seven morpho-species through morphological and genetic analysis of taxon clustering. Phylogenetic analyses resolve Philobryidae as a strongly supported monophyletic clade and sister taxon to the Limopsidae, as anticipated by their classification into the superfamily Limopsoidea. Bayesian relaxed clock analyses of divergence times suggest that genus Adacnarca radiated in the Southern Ocean from the Early Paleogene, while P. sublaevis and P. wandelensis clades radiated in the late Miocene, following the formation of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current."
https://openalex.org/W2050744987,"Aquaculture is currently one of the fastest growing food-producing sectors, accounting for around 50% of the world's food fish. Limited resources, together with climatic change, have stimulated the search for solutions to support and sustain the production of fish as a nutritious food. The integration of a constructed wetland (CW) into a recirculating hatchery (RHS) was evaluated with respect to its economic feasibility and environmental impact. The outcome of eight production cycles showed the potential of CW integration for expanded production without increased operation costs or environmental load. Concretely, the use of constructed wetland allows the rearing about 40% more fish biomass, resulting in higher production and profitability. The low requirements for space, fresh water, and energy enable the establishment of such systems almost anywhere. Constructed wetlands could enhance the productivity of existing small scale facilities, as well as larger systems, to address economic and environmental issues in aquaculture. Such systems have potential to be sustainable in the context of possible future climate change and resource limitations."

https://openalex.org/W2007460798,"During limb development, the interdigital mesenchyme has been proposed to play a signaling role instructing morphogenesis of different digit types, as well as undergoing programmed cell death necessary to free digits in animals not adapted for swimming or flying. We have generated a conditional, tamoxifen-dependent Cre line, Bmp2CreER, which drives highly selective recombination restricted to the distal limb mesoderm, largely restricted to the interdigits, and selectively active in digit ligament but not tendon progenitors at later stages. The Bmp2CreER provides a valuable new tool to dissect roles of interdigital mesenchyme and potentially investigate divergence of ligament and tendon lineages."
