https://openalex.org/W1975911018,"Emotion-specific activity in the autonomic nervous system was generated by constructing facial prototypes of emotion muscle by muscle and by reliving past emotional experiences. The autonomic activity produced distinguished not only between positive and negative emotions, but also among negative emotions. This finding challenges emotion theories that have proposed autonomic activity to be undifferentiated or that have failed to address the implications of autonomic differentiation in emotion."
https://openalex.org/W2053060309,"When cultured in a hypoxic environment similar to that found in the center of a wound, macrophages secreted active angiogenesis factor into the medium. Under conditions similar to those of well-oxygenated tissue, macrophages did not secrete active angiogenesis factor. Macrophages that secreted the factor at hypoxic conditions stopped secreting it when returned to room air. Thus the control of angiogenesis in wound healing may be the result of macrophages responding to tissue oxygen tension without the necessity of interacting with other cell types or biochemical signals."
https://openalex.org/W2091075863,"We describe two classes of mutations in the lin-12 locus of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. Ten semidominant mutations (lin-12[d]) appear to elevate the level of lin-12 activity. Thirty-two recessive alleles (lin-12[0]), including two amber mutations, appear to eliminate gene activity. The lin-12(d) and lin-12(0) mutations result in reciprocal homeotic transformations in the fates of defined cells in several different tissues. Gene dosage studies suggest that a high level of lin-12 activity specifies one cell fate and a low level specifies an alternative fate. Temperature-shift experiments indicate that lin-12 acts at the time cell fate is determined in wild type. We propose that lin-12 functions as a binary switch to control decisions between alternative cell fates during C. elegans development."
https://openalex.org/W1965058394,"The normal human N-ras gene has been cloned. In structure and sequence it closely resembles the human H-ras and K-ras genes. The three genes share regions of nucleotide homology and nucleotide divergence within coding sequences and have a common intron/exon structure, indicating that they have evolved from a similarly spliced ancestral gene. The N-ras gene of SK-N-SH neuroblastoma cells has transforming activity, while the normal N-ras gene does not, the result of a single nucleotide change substituting lysine for glutamine in position 61 of the N-ras gene product. From previous studies we conclude that amino acid substitutions in two distinct regions can activate the transforming potential of ras gene products."
https://openalex.org/W2017860003,"The saccadic system accurately compensates for perturbations of eye position produced by microstimulation of the superior colliculus. This requires that information about the stimulation-induced change in eye position be provided by an extraretinal source--either proprioceptive endings in extraocular muscles or a centrally generated corollary discharge. It is shown that compensation remains intact after elimination of extraocular muscle proprioception, demonstrating that corollary discharge provides accurate eye position information."
https://openalex.org/W2118803516,"The germ-line joining (J) gene segments and constant (C) genes encoding the beta chain of the mouse T cell antigen receptor have been isolated on a single cosmid clone. There are two constant genes, C beta 1 and C beta 2, each associated with a cluster of J beta gene segments. The nucleotide sequences of the C beta 2 gene and of the J beta 2 cluster gene segments have been determined. The coding sequence of the C beta 2 gene is very similar to the sequence of a cDNA clone encoded by the C beta 1 gene. The C beta 2 gene has four exons; exon-intron structure does not obviously correspond to the functional domains of the protein. The J beta 2 gene segment cluster contains six functional J gene segments. We have isolated specific probes for the C beta 1, C beta 2, J beta 1, and J beta 2 regions to examine DNA rearrangements in T lymphocytes. DNA rearrangements can occur in both J beta gene segment clusters, and both C beta genes appear functional."
https://openalex.org/W1976030449,"Stress-induced suppression of lymphocyte stimulation by phytohemagglutinin was demonstrated in Isolated lymphocytes and in cultures of whole blood from adrenalectomized rats. The results demonstrate that corticosteroid independent mechanisms participate in the suppression of lymphocyte function by stressors. Stress-induced lymphopenia, however, was found to be adrenal dependent, indicating that the modulation of immunity by stress is complex and multidetermined."
https://openalex.org/W2032118090,"The hippocampal slice preparation was used to study the role of acetylcholine as a synaptic transmitter. Bath-applied acetylcholine had three actions on pyramidal cells: (i) depolarization associated with increased input resistance, (ii) blockade of calcium-activated potassium responses, and (iii) blockade of accommodation of cell discharge. All these actions were reversed by the muscarinic antagonist atropine. Stimulation of sites in the slice known to contain cholinergic fibers mimicked all the actions. Furthermore, these evoked synaptic responses were enhanced by the cholinesterase inhibitor eserine and were blocked by atropine. These findings provide electrophysiological support for the role of acetylcholine as a synaptic transmitter in the brain and demonstrate that nonclassical synaptic responses involving the blockade of membrane conductances exist in the brain."

https://openalex.org/W2078802220,Histopathologic examination of lymph nodes from 39 patients with clinical and pathological criteria for cat scratch disease revealed delicate pleomorphic Gram-negative bacilli in 34 of the 39 nodes. They were within the walls of capillaries in or near areas of follicular hyperplasia and within microabscesses. They were best seen with the Warthin-Starry silver impregnation stain. Organisms in lymph node sections exposed to convalescent serum from three patients and to immunoperoxidase stained equally well with all three samples. The organisms did not react with hyperimmune sera to Legionella pneumophila nor to several species of Rickettsia. These bacilli appear to be the causative agents of cat scratch disease.
https://openalex.org/W1968415431,"A twofold thickening of capillary basement membranes of rat retinas resulting from dietary galactose was prevented by sorbinil, an inhibitor of aldose reductase. Since the basement membrane thickening was ultrastructurally similar to that typical of diabetic retinopathy, it may indicate changes in vessel permeability and susceptibility to hemorrhage. Galactosemic rats should be useful models for studying basement membrane-related complications of diabetes and for examining the potential biochemical regulation of basement membrane synthesis by aldose reductase inhibitors."
https://openalex.org/W1981836564,"We have investigated the chromosomal location, inheritance, and expression of a cloned rabbit beta-globin gene introduced into the mouse germ line by microinjection into mouse eggs. Experiments utilizing in situ hybridization to metaphase chromosomes show that the gene has integrated into one or two different chromosomal loci in each of five mouse lines analyzed. Each locus contains between three and forty copies of the foreign DNA sequence arranged in a tandem array, and the sequences at each locus are stably inherited as a single Mendelian marker. Neither globin mRNA nor polypeptides encoded by the rabbit beta-globin gene are detected in erythroid cells in the seven transgenic lines examined, indicating that the expression of the foreign gene is not correctly regulated. However, in two of the mouse lines, rabbit beta-globin transcripts are found at a low level in specific, although inappropriate, tissues: skeletal muscle in one line and testis in another line. These unusual patterns of beta-globin gene transcription are heritable traits in the two mouse lines and may result from the beta-globin gene's integration at abnormal chromosomal positions."
https://openalex.org/W1993725313,"Sequence comparison of the introns of two yeast genes (rp51A and rp51B) coding for the same ribosomal protein shows homology only in the last 50 bases of the intron. This region of the intron contains an internal conserved sequence (ICS) present near the 3' end of all sequenced yeast nuclear mRNA introns. Removal of a 29 bp sequence containing the ICS prevents splicing of an intron-containing hybrid gene. In cells containing the wild-type gene, we have detected RNA molecules that we suggest are normal splicing intermediates, generated by an endonucleolytic cut in the primary transcript at the ICS. The homology of the ICS with a sequence near the 5' end of U1 snRNA suggests a model in which an interaction in cis between the ICS and the 5' splice junction in yeast is the counterpart of the interaction in trans between U1 and 5' splice junctions in higher eucaryotes."
https://openalex.org/W2002275066,"We present a model for the functions and movements of the influenza virus P proteins (PB1, PB2, and PA) as they transcribe the virion RNAs (vRNAs) into messenger RNAs (mRNAs). Using ultraviolet-light-induced crosslinking, we show that the P proteins as a complex move from the 3' ends of the vRNA templates down the elongating mRNAs. PB2 binds the cap 1 structure of heterologous RNAs, which are cleaved to generate capped primer fragments. PB1, initially found at the first residue added onto the primer, moves to the 3' ends of the growing mRNA chains, indicating that it most likely catalyzes each nucleotide addition. PA and PB2 move down the growing chains in concert with PB1. PB2 is also associated with the cap during the first 11-15 nucleotides of chain growth, but then dissociates from the cap as the P protein complex moves further down the mRNA chains."

https://openalex.org/W2051335785,"From birth to day 21, rat offspring received daily injections of naltrexone at a dosage that blocked morphine-induced analgesia 24 hours a day. At 21 days, body, brain, and cerebellar weights of naltrexone-injected animals were 18, 11, and 5 percent greater than corresponding control weights. In addition, morphometric analysis of the cerebrum revealed a somatosensory cortex that was 18 percent thicker than that of the controls. The cerebellum of naltrexone-treated rats was 41 percent larger in total area and contained at least 70 percent more glial cells and 30 percent more granule neurons. Neurons derived prenatally were unaffected by drug treatment. These results show that naltrexone can stimulate body and brain growth in rats and suggest a role for the endorphin and opiate receptor system in development."

https://openalex.org/W2096907185,"Subgenomic RNAs (sgRNAs) were isolated from defective interfering virus produced by high multiplicity passage of the human influenza strain A/PR/8/34. Cloning and sequencing of 35 unique sgRNAs revealed that many were about 400 nucleotides long, containing about 200 nucleotides from each of the 5' and 3' ends of a full-length segment. Most of the sgRNAs were derived from segment 1, but there were examples from six other segments, including those encoding the haemagglutinin and neuraminidase. Our analysis of the sequence rearrangements found in sgRNAs indicates that they may be generated from the standard viral segments by a jumping viral polymerase that makes transitions between adjacent regions of the RNA template in the ribonucleoprotein tertiary structure."
https://openalex.org/W2061476373,The appearance of certain three-dimensional surfaces was found to depend on the orientation of the depth contours forming the surface. This was true both when the depth was specified by motion parallax and when it was specified by binocular disparities. Slowly changing depth surfaces that generated a pattern of relative motions or disparities characterized by a one-dimensional expansion-compression were perceived differently from those that produced a shear transformation.

https://openalex.org/W2169377241,"Expression of the gene coding for the trypanosome AnTat 1.1 surface antigen is linked to the duplicative transposition of a basic copy (BC) of this gene to an expression site. In two trypanosome clones successively derived from AnTat 1.1 (AnTat 1.10 and AnTat 1.1B) we found evidence that gene conversions are involved in the transformation of the AnTat 1.1 transposed element into the two new surface antigen coding sequences. Although the three resultant mRNAs--AnTat 1.1, 1.10, and 1.1B--are different, they still share large homologies. Two of them, AnTat 1.1 and 1.1B, code for surface coats that are indistinguishable by conventional serological techniques, whereas AnTat 1.10 has been found different by the same methods. The three genomic rearrangements involve two of the five members of the AnTat 1.1 gene family. These two members are both located in unstable telomeric regions similar to the expression site, each in a different orientation with respect to the DNA terminus. We have concluded that the duplicative transposition is achieved by a gene conversion that may affect variable lengths of the same silent genes, and that different members of the same surface antigen gene family can contribute to the diversification of the antigen repertoire."
https://openalex.org/W2037954312,"RecA protein promotes homologous pairing by a reaction in which the protein first binds stoichiometrically to single-stranded DNA in a slow presynaptic step, and then conjoins single-stranded and duplex DNA, thereby forming a ternary complex. RecA protein did not pair molecules that shared only 30 bp homology, but, with full efficiency, it paired circular single-stranded and linear duplex molecules in which homology was limited to 151 bp at one end of the duplex DNA. The initial rate of the pairing reaction was directly related to the length of the heterologous part of the duplex DNA, which we varied from 0 to 3060 base pairs. Since interactions involving the heterologous part of a molecule speed the location of a small homologous region, we conclude that RecA protein promotes homologous alignment by a processive mechanism involving relative motion of conjoined molecules within the ternary complex."

https://openalex.org/W2029528673,"Explants of embryonic rat mesencephalon were grown in organotypic culture. Addition of 10 microM 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) to the culture medium for 4 to 7 days resulted in loss of dopamine cell bodies and fiber outgrowths, as observed by fluorescence histochemistry. At the same time, the cultures showed decreased uptake of tritium-labeled dopamine. However, no signs of generalized toxicity were evident when the explant cultures were viewed by light and phase-contrast microscopy. These results show that MPTP exerts a relatively selective destructive action in dopamine neurons in vitro, similar to the action observed in humans and monkeys in vivo. Pargyline (10 microM), a monoamine oxidase inhibitor, protected the dopamine neurons in the explants. Organotypic cultures provide an experimental model for the study of the properties of MPTP in vitro."
https://openalex.org/W2030698901,"Cigarette smoking is the major risk factor for the development of pulmonary emphysema, a disorder that may result from an imbalance between the elastase and antielastase levels in the lungs. Decreased functional alpha 1-protease inhibitor, an inhibitor of neutrophil elastase, might render smokers susceptible to elastase-catalyzed destruction of pulmonary elastic fibers and the development of emphysema. Binding and inactivation of isotopically labeled porcine pancreatic elastase and human neutrophil elastase by alpha 1-protease inhibitor were measured in fluid obtained by bronchoalveolar lavage of volunteers. The inhibition of elastase-catalyzed solubilization of elastin and a tripeptide substrate were also determined. The mean level of functional alpha 1-protease inhibitor in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of smokers was found to be equal to or greater than that of nonsmokers, contradicting reports by other investigators. Increased elastase derived from pulmonary neutrophils, rather than decreased functional alpha 1-protease inhibitor, appears to be the main factor in the genesis of emphysema in smokers."
https://openalex.org/W1575800126,"The molecular basis of the cognitive changes that accompany aging is unknown. Since several lines of evidence suggest that senescence may alter calcium homeostasis, 45calcium uptake was determined in brain synaptosomes from aged rats. In low potassium (5 mM KCl) media, aging altered calcium influx: 104.2% (3 months), 100.0% (6 months), 76.7% (15 months), or 58.6% (27 months). In 31 mM KCl media, uptake declined with age from 106.6% (3 months) to 100.0% (6 months), 67.8% (15 months), or 45.8% (27 months). 3,4-Diaminopyridine elevated the potassium-stimulated calcium influx 2.3% (3 months), 10.2% (6 months), 31.8% (15 months), or 78.8% (27 months) when they are compared to non-drug-treated synaptosomes of the same age. The calcium that binds superficially to the plasma membrane changed as the age increased from 3 months (105.4%) to 6 months (100.0%), 15 months (116.1%), or 27 months (141.4%). 3,4-Diaminopyridine reduced this binding at 15 or 27 months to 109.3 or 121.4%, when compared to the 6 month old rats respectively. The decline in synaptosomal calcium uptake may alter neuronal metabolism which leads to the reduction in mental function that accompanies aging."
https://openalex.org/W1999993218,"Various proposals that a stochastic event, “commitment” is the first and rate-limiting step in mammalian cell differentiation were tested in one cell type, B16C3 mouse melanoma cells. Differentiation (pigment production) was observed in time-lapse films and in cloned single cells. As predicted by all the theories, onset of differentiation was at widely variable times in different cells after stimulation; and selection experiments showed that little of the variability was genetic. Contrary to some theories, differentiation appeared unrelated to cell division. Two properties of the melanoma cells did not fit any of the theories: times of differentiation were highly correlated in sister cells; and differentiation could be reversed in a proportion of cells, which was highest at the lowest levels of pigmentation. Dedifferentiation was associated with cell proliferation, so that most pigmented clones were small and most unpigmented clones large. These findings are accommodated by a model in which functions associated with differentiation can switch on and off, but an inhibition of the off transition builds up in the on state."
https://openalex.org/W1968513975,The lung colonization of B16-F1 cells grown in flat and spherical configurations was studied. Cells cultivated in vitro as spheroids on a nonadhesive substrate expressed in a reversible fashion a marked increase in their propensity to establish metastases. The altered metastatic capability was accompanied by a reversible reduction in the accessibility of cell surface proteins to external iodination and by a dramatic decrease in the synthesis of vimentin.
https://openalex.org/W1492959850,"Four oligosaccharides in the reduced form were isolated from RMG (a mucin-type glycoprotein from a human rectal adenocarcinoma). They were 1) Sia alpha s2 leads to 6GalNAc-ol; 2) Sia alpha 2 leads to 6(Gal beta 1 leads to 3)GalNAc-ol; 3) Sia alpha 2 leads to 6(GlcNAc beta 1 leads to 3)GalNAc-ol; and 4) Sia alpha 2 leads to 6(GalNAc alpha 1 leads to 3)GalNAc-ol. The amounts of oligosaccharides 1, 2, 3, and 4 corresponded to 27, 5, 11, and 8% of the total N-acetylgalactosaminitol produced on alkaline borohydride treatment of RMG. To determine the structures of oligosaccharides 2, 3, and 4, a mixture of the three was subjected to methylation analysis which revealed that the N-acetylgalactosaminitol was substituted at both C-3 and C-6 and other sugars at the nonreducing ends. Desialized oligosaccharides were prepared, and the structures were deduced by analysis of the permethylated sugars on gas-liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry. Anomeric configurations were determined by exoglycosidase digestions except for galactose which was analyzed by chromium trioxide oxidation."
https://openalex.org/W1975157957,"Over a wide range of intensities, subjects were able to detect small differences in the intensity of a high-frequency band of noise that was presented with a relatively intense, complementary band-reject noise. This indicates that neither of two possible mechanisms for peripheral intensity coding, those based on timing and on spread of excitation, is necessary for the large dynamic range of human hearing. It is shown that the information available in the firing rate of a small number of nerve fibers can account for these data."
https://openalex.org/W1560347431,"In the previous communication (Mellis, S. J., and Baenziger, J. U. (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 11546-11556), the structures of the oligosaccharides present at the 3 asparagine glycosylation sites of a human IgD myeloma protein were defined. In this communication, we present the structures of the O-glycosidically linked oligosaccharides located in the hinge region of IgD:WAH. Three or four threonine residues and one serine residue in the region bear O-glycosidically linked oligosaccharides. Approximately 50% of these molecules have the structure Gal beta 1 leads to 3 GalNAc which is identical with the structure of the predominant oligosaccharide in the hinge region of human IgA1 myeloma proteins (Baenziger, J. U., and Kornfeld, S. (1974) J. Biol. Chem. 249, 7270-7281). The remainder of the oligosaccharides contain 1 or 2 residues of N-acetylneuraminic acid and have the structures NeuAc alpha 2 leads to 3Gal beta 1 leads to 3GalNAc (30%), Gal beta 1 leads to (NeuAc alpha 2 leads to 6)GalNAc (12%), and NeuAc alpha 2 leads to 3Gal beta 1 leads to 3(NeuAc alpha 2 leads to 6)GalNAc (8%). The sialylated molecules have not been encountered previously on other human immunoglobulin heavy chains. These structures, however, have been described on a number of secreted and membrane glycoproteins. Examination of oligosaccharides isolated from different subregions of the IgD hinge indicated that a specific distribution of the sialylated structures among the glycosylated amino acids of the hinge region is not likely."
https://openalex.org/W2087691827,"Cloned extrachromosomal circular copia elements were studied by nucleotide sequence and restriction enzyme analysis to determine their mechanisms of formation and their possible roles in copia transposition. Rearranged circular copias containing inverted segments flanked by 5 bp sequence duplication were observed, suggesting that circular copias are capable of integrating into their own sequences. Such copia circles are analogous to similarly rearranged retrovirus circles, strengthening the relationship between the copia-like elements and retroviruses. There is marked sequence heterogeneity at the junction between the fused terminal direct repeats of seven copia circles. The junctions contain 0-15 bp inserts, the sequences of which are inconsistent with the creation of these particular molecules by reverse transcription."
https://openalex.org/W2040207627,"Single type B photoreceptors in intact, restrained Hermissenda were impaled with a microelectrode and exposed to either paired or unpaired presentations of light and depolarizing current to simulate natural stimulus effects during conditioning with light and rotation. Paired, but not unpaired, stimulus presentations produced cumulative depolarization and increased input resistance in type B cells. These membrane changes are similar to those observed after pairings of light and rotation are administered to either intact animals or isolated nervous systems or when light is paired with electrical stimulation of the vestibular system in isolated nervous systems. One and two days after treatment, pairing- and light-specific suppression of phototactic behavior was observed in recovered animals. These findings indicate that the membrane changes of type B cells produced by pairing light with current injections cause acquisition of the learned behavior."
https://openalex.org/W1548263075,"The complete amino acid sequence of the human myeloma IgD:WAH has been determined and the sites of asparagine glycosylation identified as residues 354, 445, and 496 (Takahashi, N., Tetaert, D., Debuiere, B., Lin, L.-C., and Putnam, F. W. (1982) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 79, 2850-2854). We have determined the structures of the oligosaccharides at each of these positions. Asn 354 bears oligosaccharides exclusively of the high mannose type containing from 5 to 9 mannose residues. Twenty per cent of the oligosaccharides at this site contain 1 glucose residue at the terminus of the branch emanating from the alpha 1 leads to 3-linked core mannose which is believed to reflect incomplete processing of the triglucosyl-high mannose oligosaccharide intermediate following transfer from dolichol to nascent peptide. Asn 445 and Asn 496 bear exclusively dibranched complex oligosaccharide structures; 30-40% of these molecules contain a bisecting GlcNAc-linked beta 1 leads to 4 to the innermost core mannose residue. At Asn 445, 40% of both the bisected and nonbisected oligosaccharides contain 1 residue of fucose on the Asn-linked GlcNAc and 50% bear a single N-acetylneuraminic acid residue. The oligosaccharides at Asn 496 are devoid of sialic acid and fucose. Thus, IgD:WAH is notable for the presence of virtually unprocessed oligosaccharide structures (glucosylated high mannose) on the same peptide backbone as extensively processed complex type molecules. The finding that each of the 3 Asn glycosylation sites of IgD:WAH bears either exclusively a complex or a high mannose type oligosaccharide indicates that there is considerable specificity in the glycosylation process. These oligosaccharides, nonetheless, display extensive microheterogeneity at each location."
https://openalex.org/W2062351438,Neonatal mice were reared in an acoustic environment that repetitively entrained activity in a large proportion of primary auditory afferents during the period when the frequency tuning of auditory neurons normally develops. The tuning curves obtained from these mice were significantly broader than those of normally reared mice of the same age. This suggests that the normal frequency tuning of neurons was prevented or delayed by synchronizing the pattern of activity imposed on the auditory pathway.
https://openalex.org/W1580573268,"The core protein of proteoglycans from cartilage is substituted with glycosaminoglycans as well as N- and O-glycosidically linked oligosaccharides. We have taken advantage of the long intracellular half-life of the core protein precursor to the rat chondrosarcoma proteoglycan to study the temporal relationship between the addition of the chondroitin sulfate chains and the O-linked oligosaccharides onto the core protein during the formation of the completed proteoglycan molecule. Chondrocyte cultures were pulsed on day 2 with [6-3H]glucosamine for times ranging from 30-420 min. Media and corresponding 4% zwittergent, 4 M guanidine HCl extracts were then pooled and subjected to dissociative density gradient ultracentrifugation to yield purified proteoglycan monomers which were then subjected to alkaline borohydride treatment. The released chondroitin sulfate chains were then purified by precipitation with 50% (v/v) ethanol. The O-linked oligosaccharide-alditols in the supernatant fractions were purified by molecular sieve chromatography on Bio-Gel P-6, and analyzed after digestion with alpha-neuraminidase and subsequent chromatography on Bio-Gel P-2. The different O-linked oligosaccharide-alditols were identified from their hexosamine and hexosaminitol contents. The kinetics of entry of 3H label into N-acetylgalactosamine of chondroitin sulfate was indistinguishable from that into either N-acetylglucosamine or N-acetylgalactosaminitol residues of the oligosaccharide-alditols, with half-times to linear incorporation of 10-17 min. These results show that initiation as well as completion of the O-linked oligosaccharides on the core protein occurs essentially at the same time that chondroitin sulfate chains are added. The results suggest that these biosynthetic processes occur in the Golgi apparatus during the last few minutes of the total intracellular dwell time (half-time of about 90 min) of the core protein acceptor."
https://openalex.org/W1964690379,"Mutant strains of D. discoideum are described that can complete morphogenesis and cytodifferentiation but which express vastly reduced levels of the galactose-binding lectins discoidin I and II (less than 1% and 1%–2% respectively) compared to the wild-type control. Mutant cells proceeding through development lack lectin activity, lectin protein, and specific lectin mRNA. In contrast, the genes encoding these proteins are present in their wild-type configurations in the genome. Since these proteins are encoded by four to five discrete genes, the mutations in these strains are most likely in genes involved in the regulation of the expression of members of this multigene family. The results also indicate that the discoidin lectins may not be required for fruiting body construction in this organism. Finally, coupled with the recent ability to transform D. discoideum, these mutants open the way to identification and isolation of regulatory genes and their products."
https://openalex.org/W2094844881,"Noise analysis of rabbit bladder revealed two components: Lorentzian noise, arising from interaction of amiloride with the Na+ channel, and flicker noise (l/f, where f is frequency), as in other biological membranes. Hydrostatic pressure, which causes exchange between intracellular vesicular membrane and apical membrane, increases the number but not the single-channel current of the amiloride-sensitive channels. Flicker noise arises from degraded channels that have lost amiloride sensitivity and Na+ to K+ selectivity. The degraded channels were selectively removed by washing the mucosal surface. These results imply channel turnover by intracellular synthesis, transfer from vesicular to apical membrane, degradation, and elimination."
https://openalex.org/W1513163285,"From wild type mouse lymphoma cells, a clone, (FURT-1A), was isolated by virtue of its resistance to 1 microM 5-fluorouracil and 10 microM thymidine. In comparative growth rate experiments, FURT-1A cells were also less sensitive than parental cells to the growth inhibitory effects of thymidine, deoxyguanosine, 5-fluorouridine, and arabinosylcytosine. The altered growth sensitivity of FURT-1A cells to cytotoxic nucleosides was directly related to their decreased ability to accumulate the corresponding triphosphate from exogenous nucleoside. FURT-1A cells contained elevated cytidylate nucleotide pools which prevented normal growth sensitivity and interfered with the salvage of nucleosides by inhibiting nucleoside kinase activities, by stimulating nucleotide dephosphorylating activities, and by overcoming certain allosteric inhibitions imposed on ribonucleotide reductase. Metabolic flux experiments with [3H]uridine in situ indicated that FURT-1A cells had a 2-fold enhanced rate of conversion of UTP to CTP. Kinetic analyses indicated that the CTP synthetase activity in extracts of FURT-1A cells was refractory to inhibition by CTP. The genetic loss of normal allosteric inhibition of the CTP synthetase activity in FURT-1A cells could account for the unusual phenotypic properties of these cells and conferred a high spontaneous mutator phenotype to cells possessing this mutation."

For biophysical analysis the soma was impaled with a microelectrode when the ganglion was subsequently exposed. The technique is illustrated for several identified neurons involved in different behaviors.
https://openalex.org/W1523676194,"Abstract In the presence of peroxyphenylacetic acid and a hydroxylatable substrate, cytochrome P-450LM2 catalyzes two reactions which proceed concurrently, decarboxylation of the peroxyacid and hydroxylation of substrate. While the first process is definitely the result of homolytic cleavage of the peroxide O--O bond, the second may involve a different mechanistic pathway. We have undertaken to determine the relationship between these two processes through a kinetic analysis of the system. Seven different mechanistic schemes are advanced to account for the two processes. The two reactions were found to have different apparent Michaelis constants for peroxyacid and different inhibition constants for cyanide. Since the ratio of the two products is saturable at high substrate concentrations, the decarboxylation reaction can proceed from both substrate-bound and substrate-free enzyme. By appropriate manipulation of the rate equations it is possible to derive expressions for the ratio of hydrogen abstraction rate constants for a series of p-substituted toluene substrates compared to toluene. The nature of the correlation of these expressions with delta in a Hammett plot allowed some of the schemes to be eliminated. After consideration of all the data, we concluded that the processes of decarboxylation and hydroxylation occur in separate pathways and do not involve any common intermediate beyond the ferric resting state of the enzyme."

This glycoprotein was found to be a carbohydrate variant in which, for both donors, certain O-glycosidically linked saccharides retained the core structure consisting of NeuAc(alpha 2,3)Gal(beta 1,3)GalNAc that is common to all O-linked saccharides of the MN glycoproteins, and, in addition, contained substituents, of varying chain lengths, on the primary carbinol of GalNAc. These saccharides were released from the polypeptide by beta-elimination in the presence of sodium borohydride, and aspects of their structure were investigated by glycosidase digestion and periodate oxidation. Thus, the smallest variant structure was deduced to be NeuAc(alpha 2,3)Gal(beta 1,3)[GlcNAc(beta 1,6)]H2GalNAc. The 6-O-linked GlcNAc appears to serve as the focus of further chain elongation reactions, involving alternate additions of Gal and GlcNAc residues and leading to the formation of several homologous structures. Two such structures, NeuAc(alpha 2,3)Gal(beta 1,3)[GlcNAc(beta 1,?) Gal(beta 1,3/4)GlcNAc(beta 1,6)]H2GalNAc and NeuAc(alpha 2,3) Gal(beta 1,3)[Gal(beta 1,3/4)GlcNAc(beta 1,6)]H2GalNAc were the predominant species present. A larger saccharide was also isolated and its partial sequence was determined to be Gal(beta 1,3/4)GlcNAc(beta 1,?)[Gal(beta 1,3/4)Glc-NAc(beta 1,?)] Gal(beta 1,3/4)GlcNAc(beta 1,6)[NeuAc(alpha 2,3)Gal-(beta 1,3)]H2GalNAc. Because the peptide portion of these glycoproteins contains two methionine residues, it was possible to isolate two CNBr glycopeptides from separate regions of the molecule, and to assess the distribution of these variant structures in the polypeptide. The saccharides were linked to about 2-3 Ser and/or Thr residues in the donor LG glycoprotein and one of the attachment sites was located within the CNBr glycooctapeptide representing the NH2 terminus. Considerable heterogeneity in saccharide structure was documented for this site, and it is likely that such heterogeneity occurs also at other sites. The variant saccharides bear structural similarities to the core region of O-linked saccharides of certain blood group-active mucins and ovarian cyst secretions, and to the outer sequences of N-linked carbohydrate units (I-, i-active) of the major glycoprotein of human erythrocytes, band 3. The structures of the variant saccharides suggest that they may be potential precursors of H blood group-active carbohydrates, present in varying degrees of maturity, and attached to an integral protein of erythrocytes."
https://openalex.org/W1979193543,"Changes occur in the synthesis and axonal transport of neuronal proteins in dorsal-root ganglia axons as a result of contact with cells from the spinal cord during synapse formation. Dorsal-root ganglia cells were cultured in a compartmental cel culture system that allows separate access to neuronal cell bodies and their axons. When cells from the ventral spinal cord were cultured with the dorsal-root ganglia axons, synapses were established within a few days. Metabolic labeling and two-dimensional electrophoresis revealed that four of more than 300 axonal proteins had changed in their expression by the time synapses were established. The highly selective nature of these changes suggests that the proteins involved may be important in the processes of axon growth and synapse formation and their regulation by the regional environment."
https://openalex.org/W1663768187,"Abstract The chemiosmotic hypothesis predicts that buffers which permeate chloroplast membranes should delay the formation of the proton gradient at the onset of illumination. If valinomycin and KCl are present to collapse the electrical potential as well, this delay should result in a lag in initial ATP synthesis. Using rapid-mix, acid-quench techniques, we have found that in light-driven ATP synthesis the permeant buffer imidazole does not increase the initial lag caused by the valinomycin-KCl pair. Similar results are obtained under methyl viologen or phenazine methosulfate/ascorbate-mediated photophosphorylation and are independent of the internal volume of the chloroplasts. Furthermore, we have observed that chloroplasts can synthesize significant amounts of ATP in darkness following an illumination period as short as 100 ms. This capacity for ATP synthesis in darkness after short pre-illumination periods is decreased in the presence of imidazole, and this may account for the apparent lags reported in earlier studies which have used rapid flash photophosphorylation in the presence of permeant buffers. The results of the present study argue that in chloroplasts, initial ATP synthesis and post-illumination ATP synthesis are driven by distinct components of the proton motive potential."
https://openalex.org/W1488571454,"Abstract Receptor-estradiol complexes (RE2) formed at 0 degree C in hypotonic buffers bind poorly to nuclei (nonactivated state); their sedimentation coefficient in low or high salt sucrose density gradients (SDG) is 8 S or 4 S, respectively (untransformed state); estradiol dissociates from untransformed RE2 at a high rate (k-1 = 0.44 min-1). Brief heating (28 degrees C, 30 min) induces activation (increased binding of RE2 to nuclei and polyanions), transformation (formation of receptor dimers which sediment at 6 S in 0.4 M KCl/borate SDG) and RE2 transition into a state from which E2 dissociates at a lower rate (k-2 = 8 X 10(-3) min-1). We have examined the role of arginyl residues in the above changes in receptor properties. It is well established (Patthy, L., and Smith, E. L. (1975) J. Biol. Chem. 250, 557-564; 565-569) that 1,2-cyclohexanedione (1,2-CHD) is a highly specific arginine-modifying agent; in borate buffer at 28 degrees C, but not at 0 degrees C, peptide arginyls are covalently modified. RE2 complexes heated in the presence of 1,2-CHD (50 mM) bind poorly to nuclei; 1,4-cyclohexamedione and 1,2-cyclohexanediol had no effect. This reagent also prevents the temperature-induced transition of RE2 into a state with slow E2 dissociation rates although it does not interfere with heat transformation (formation of 6 S dimer). Modification of heat-activated and transformed RE2 by 1,2-CHD causes a loss in receptor binding to nuclei and alters RE2 from a state with slow into a state with fast E2 dissociation rates, although the receptor remains unaltered in the transformed 6 S state. At 0 degree C, i.e. in the absence of covalent arginyl modification, 1,2-CHD promotes dissociation of the 8 S aggregate into 4.6 S subunits which bind to nuclei to the same extent as heat-transformed control RE2. Heating of the molybdate-stabilized 8 S receptor in the presence of 1,2-CHD yields a nonactivated 8 S receptor (4.6 S on high salt SDG); removal of molybdate and unreacted 1,2-CHD by gel filtration at 0 degree C followed by exposure to high ionic strength causes 8 S to 4 S dissociation; these 4 S subunits, however, do not bind to nuclei, suggesting that their nucleotropic domain was accessible to 1,2-CHD modification while the receptor was in the aggregated 8 S state. It is proposed that the nuclear binding site of the estrogen receptor contains arginyl residues. Furthermore, a distinct set of arginyl residues appears to be related to the estrogen-binding domain; its integrity is required for the heat-induced formation and maintenance of the RE2 state with slow E2 dissociation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"

Single prostaglandins, even at higher doses, interrupted pregnancy in only one-third of the monkeys. The most effective treatment, 5-oxa-17-phenyl-18,19,20-trinor prostaglandin F1 alpha methyl ester plus 9-deoxo-16,16-dimethyl-9-methylene prostaglandin E2, promptly intercepted early pregnancy after a single administration and without side effects."
https://openalex.org/W1568701936,"We recently reported that a skeletal muscle factor specifically activates the branched-chain alpha-ketoacid (BCKA) dehydrogenase in liver mitochondria (Paul, H. S., and Adibi, S. A. (1982) J. Biol. Chem. 257, 12581-12588). The evidence suggested that the muscle factor may be a phosphatase or may stimulate the phosphatase in liver mitochondria, thus converting the inactive BCKA dehydrogenase into an active form. In the present study we have investigated these possibilities. The muscle factor did not increase the activity of BCKA dehydrogenase which was previously activated in vitro by preincubation of mitochondria or by the addition of Triton or Ca2+ to the incubation medium. The muscle factor had little or no stimulatory effect on BCKA dehydrogenase when this enzyme was activated in vivo by treatment of rats with streptozotocin or clofibrate. The addition of NaF (an inhibitor of phosphatase) to the incubation medium entirely abolished the stimulatory effect of the muscle factor on BCKA dehydrogenase. Elimination of phosphatase by partial purification of BCKA dehydrogenase resulted in loss of stimulation of the dehydrogenase by the muscle factor. These results suggest that the muscle factor activates the BCKA dehydrogenase in liver mitochondria by stimulating its associated phosphatase."
https://openalex.org/W1509713394,"A monoclinic form of crystalline porcine heart mitochondrial malate dehydrogenase has been prepared and contains two dimers in the asymmetric unit. The analysis of single crystal x-ray data shows that the two dimers are packed in the crystal lattice as a tetramer with approximate 222-point symmetry. Heavy atom derivatives using the compounds ethylmercurithiosalicylic acid and IrCl3 have been characterized and multiple isomorphous replacement methods have been used to obtain an electron density map at 5.3-A resolution. The phasing of the x-ray data was aided by including contributions from crystal forms with and without the coenzyme, NAD+. By using electron density averaging methods, the quality of the low resolution electron density map was improved to the point where it was possible to establish the overall conformation of mitochondrial malate dehydrogenase. The results confirm the proposed similarities between the mitochondrial and cytoplasmic forms of the malate dehydrogenases. Studies using x-ray data from the apo- and holo-forms of the enzyme describe the location of the active site as well as the arrangement of subunits in the tetrameric crystalline form of the enzyme."
