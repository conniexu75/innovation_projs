https://openalex.org/W2991248607,"Cohesin extrudes DNA loops DNA is folded into loops in eukaryotic cells by a process that depends on a ring-shaped adenosine triphosphatase complex called cohesin. Davidson et al. and Kim et al. now show that in the presence of the NIPBLMAU2 protein complex, the human cohesin complex can function as a molecular motor that extrudes DNA loops with high speed in vitro. In contrast to how it mediates sister chromatid cohesion, cohesin does not appear to entrap DNA topologically during loop extrusion. The results provide direct evidence for the loop extrusion model of chromatin organization and suggest that genome architecture is highly dynamic. Science , this issue p. 1338 , p. 1345"

Unique to two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals materials, the control can be achieved by modifying the stacking order through rotation and translation between the layers. Here, we report the first observation of stacking dependent interlayer magnetism in the 2D magnetic semiconductor, chromium tribromide (CrBr3), enabled by the successful growth of its monolayer and bilayer through molecular beam epitaxy. Using in situ spin-polarized scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy, we directly correlated the atomic lattice structure with observed magnetic order. We demonstrated that while individual CrBr3 monolayer is ferromagnetic, the interlayer coupling in bilayer depends strongly on the stacking order and can be either ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic. Our observations provide direct experimental evidence for exploring the stacking dependent layered magnetism, and pave the way for manipulating 2D magnetism with unique layer twist angle control."
https://openalex.org/W2983638220,"The generation of myelin-forming oligodendrocytes persists throughout life and is regulated by neural activity. Here we tested whether experience-driven changes in oligodendrogenesis are important for memory consolidation. We found that water maze learning promotes oligodendrogenesis and de novo myelination in the cortex and associated white matter tracts. Preventing these learning-induced increases in oligodendrogenesis without affecting existing oligodendrocytes impaired memory consolidation of water maze, as well as contextual fear, memories. These results suggest that de novo myelination tunes activated circuits, promoting coordinated activity that is important for memory consolidation. Consistent with this, contextual fear learning increased the coupling of hippocampal sharp wave ripples and cortical spindles, and these learning-induced increases in ripple-spindle coupling were blocked when oligodendrogenesis was suppressed. Our results identify a non-neuronal form of plasticity that remodels hippocampal-cortical networks following learning and is required for memory consolidation."

Mehr et al. examined ethnographic data and observed music in every society sampled (see the Perspective by Fitch and Popescu). For songs specifically, three dimensions characterize more than 25% of the performances studied: formality of the performance, arousal level, and religiosity. There is more variation in musical behavior within societies than between societies, and societies show similar levels of within-society variation in musical behavior. At the same time, one-third of societies significantly differ from average for any given dimension, and half of all societies differ from average on at least one dimension, indicating variability across cultures.

Forging these bonds with electron-rich nitrogen reactants is challenging because the nitrogen groups can coordinate with, and thus interfere with, the catalyst. Li et al. report a cooperative approach to overcoming this obstacle (see the Perspective by Ovian and Jacobsen). They used a copper catalyst to activate the carbon reactant and then a hydrogen-bonding thiourea catalyst to set the product geometry with high selectivity. The reaction is compatible with a broad range of diazo ester and amine coupling partners. Science , this issue p. 990 ; see also p. 948"

Siciliano et al. first established a behavioral measure to assess how predisposition interacts with experience to produce compulsive drinking in a subset of mice (see the Perspective by Nixon and Mangieri). In search of the underlying neurobiological mechanism, they discovered that a discrete circuit between the medial prefrontal cortex and brainstem is central for the development of compulsive drinking. This circuit serves as both a biomarker for the development of compulsive drinking and a driver of its expression. It can bidirectionally control compulsive behavior by mitigating or mimicking punishment signals. Science , this issue p. 1008 ; see also p. 947"

Yet such algorithms often exhibit undesirable behavior, from various types of bias to causing financial loss or delaying medical diagnoses. In standard machine learning approaches, the burden of avoiding this harmful behavior is placed on the user of the algorithm, who most often is not a computer scientist.

https://openalex.org/W2991175285,"N6-Methyladenosine (m6A) is the most abundant post-transcriptional mRNA modification in eukaryotes and exerts many of its effects on gene expression through reader proteins that bind specifically to m6A-containing transcripts. Fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP), an RNA-binding protein, has previously been shown to affect the translation of target mRNAs and trafficking of mRNA granules. Loss of function of FMRP causes fragile X syndrome, the most common form of inherited intellectual disability in humans. Using HEK293T cells, siRNA-mediated gene knockdown, cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions, RNA-Seq, and LC-MS/MS analyses, we demonstrate here that FMRP binds directly to a collection of m6A sites on mRNAs. FMRP depletion increased mRNA m6A levels in the nucleus. Moreover, the abundance of FMRP targets in the cytoplasm relative to the nucleus was decreased in Fmr1-KO mice, an effect also observed in highly methylated genes. We conclude that FMRP may affect the nuclear export of m6A-modified RNA targets."

These immune cells possess a metal-ion transporter called SLC11A1 or NRAMP1, which is known to be involved in infection resistance. Cunrath and Bumann studied mice that only differ in one allele of the SLC11A1 gene, which leaves mice either susceptible or resistant to infection. Proteomic analyses showed that bacteria isolated from mice with functional SLC11A1 alleles experienced metal starvation, particularly of magnesium. The resulting impairment of bacterial growth seems to be the primary mode of action of SLC11A1 against invading pathogens. Science , this issue p. 995"
https://openalex.org/W2988660047,"Inhibitory neurons, which play a critical role in decision-making models, are often simplified as a single pool of non-selective neurons lacking connection specificity. This assumption is supported by observations in the primary visual cortex: inhibitory neurons are broadly tuned in vivo and show non-specific connectivity in slice. The selectivity of excitatory and inhibitory neurons within decision circuits and, hence, the validity of decision-making models are unknown. We simultaneously measured excitatory and inhibitory neurons in the posterior parietal cortex of mice judging multisensory stimuli. Surprisingly, excitatory and inhibitory neurons were equally selective for the animal’s choice, both at the single-cell and population level. Further, both cell types exhibited similar changes in selectivity and temporal dynamics during learning, paralleling behavioral improvements. These observations, combined with modeling, argue against circuit architectures assuming non-selective inhibitory neurons. Instead, they argue for selective subnetworks of inhibitory and excitatory neurons that are shaped by experience to support expert decision-making."

However, in materials with strong correlations, this approximation can break down, leading to anomalous transport properties at high temperatures. Huang et al. used quantum Monte Carlo calculations to look for this so-called strange metal phase in the simplest two-dimensional model of interacting electrons, the Hubbard model. They found that the calculated resistivity had a linear temperature dependence when hole doping was introduced, as expected in the strange metal phase. This observation provides confidence that simplified models can be used to describe and understand the behavior of real materials, such as cuprate high-temperature superconductors.

One of the most pronounced examples of a sexually selected trait is the prothoracic horns of scarab beetles, which, in the most extreme cases, can be nearly half as long as the length of the beetle. It is fairly easy to understand how selection might have shaped these horns, but understanding how development shaped them from a hornless ancestor is a much more complex proposition.

https://openalex.org/W2991515658,"The simultaneous multi-slice EPI (SMS-EPI, a.k.a. MB-EPI) sequence has met immense popularity recently in functional neuroimaging. A still less common alternative is the use of 3D-EPI, which offers similar acceleration capabilities. The aim of this work was to compare the SMS-EPI and the 3D-EPI sequences in terms of sampling strategies for the detection of task-evoked activations at 7T using detection theory. To this end, the spatial and temporal resolutions of the sequences were matched (1.6 mm isotropic resolution, TR = 1200 ms) and their excitation profiles were homogenized by means of calibration-free parallel-transmission (Universal Pulses). We used a fast-event “localizer” paradigm of 5:20 min in order to probe sensorimotor functions (visual, auditory and motor tasks) as well as higher level functions (language comprehension, mental calculation), where results from a previous large-scale study at 3T (N = 81) served as ground-truth reference for the brain areas implicated in each cognitive function. In the current study, ten subjects were scanned while their activation maps were generated for each cognitive function with the GLM analysis. The SMS-EPI and 3D-EPI sequences were compared in terms of raw tSNR, t-score testing for the mean signal, activation strength and accuracy of the robust sensorimotor functions. To this end, the sensitivity and specificity of these contrasts were computed by comparing their activation maps to the reference brain areas obtained in the 3T study. Estimated flip angle distributions in the brain reported a normalized root mean square deviation from the target value below 10% for both sequences. The analysis of the t-score testing for the mean signal revealed temporal noise correlations, suggesting the use of this metric instead of the traditional tSNR for testing fMRI sequences. The SMS-EPI and 3D-EPI thereby yielded similar performance from a detection theory perspective."

The functionality and survival of these grafts with cultured hCECs was examined in a rabbit model of corneal endothelial damage after central descemetorhexis. Rabbits received laminas with and without hCECs (TEEK and control group, respectively).hCEC seeding over fibronectin-coated laminas provided an optimal and consistent endothelial cell count density and polygonal shape on the decellularized laminas, showing active pump fuction. Surgery was performed uneventfully as standard Descemet stripping automated endothelial keratoplasty (DSAEK). Corneal transparency gradually recovered in the TEEK group, whereas haze and edema persisted for up to 4 weeks in the controls. Histologic examination showed endothelial cells of human origin covering the posterior surface of the graft in the TEEK group.Grafting of decellularized stroma carriers re-surfaced with human corneal endothelial cells ex vivo can be a readily translatable method to improve visual quality in corneal endothelial diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2990421402,"Research on the perception of faces typically assumes that there are some universal values of attractiveness which are shared across individuals and cultures. The perception of attractiveness may, however, vary across cultures due to local differences in both facial morphology and standards of beauty. To examine cross-cultural consensus in the ratings of attractiveness, we presented a set of 120 non-manipulated photographs of Czech faces to ten samples of raters from both European (Czech Republic, Estonia, Sweden, Romania, Turkey, Portugal) and non-European countries (Brazil, India, Cameroon, Namibia). We examined the relative contribution of three facial markers (sexual shape dimorphism, averageness, fluctuating asymmetry) to the perception of attractiveness as well as the possible influence of eye color, which is a locally specific trait. In general, we found that both male and female faces which were closer to the average and more feminine in shape were regarded as more attractive, while fluctuating asymmetry had no effect. Despite a high cross-cultural consensus on attractiveness standards, significant differences in the perception of attractiveness seem to be related to the level of socio-economic development (as measured by the Human Development Index, HDI). Attractiveness ratings by raters from low-HDI countries (India, Cameroon, Namibia) converged less with ratings from Czech Republic than ratings from high-HDI countries (European countries and Brazil). With respect to eye color, some local patterns emerged which we discuss as a consequence of negative frequency-dependent selection."
https://openalex.org/W2989886864,"Insects express chemical receptors within sensory neurons that are activated by specific cues in the environment, thereby influencing the acquisition of critical resources. A significant gap in our current understanding of insect chemical ecology is defining the molecular mechanisms that underlie sensitivity to plant-emitted volatiles. Linalool is a commonly-occurring monoterpene that has various effects on insect behavior, either acting as an attractant or a repellent, and existing in nature as one of two possible stereoisomers, (R)-(–)-linalool and (S)-(+)-linalool. In this study, we have used a cell-based functional assay to identify linalool and structurally-related compounds as ligands of Odorant receptor 29, a labellum-expressed receptor in the malaria vector mosquito, Anopheles gambiae (AgamOr29). While (R)-(–)-linalool activates AgamOr29, a mixture of the (R) and (S) stereoisomers activates the receptor with higher potency, implying enantiomeric selectivity. Orthologs of Or29 are present in the genomes of Anophelines within the Cellia subgenus. The conservation of this receptor across Anopheline lineages suggests that this ecologically important compound might serve as an attraction cue for nectar-seeking mosquitoes. Moreover, the characterization of a mosquito terpene receptor could serve as a foundation for future ligand-receptor studies of plant volatiles and for the discovery of compounds that can be integrated into push-pull vector control strategies."
https://openalex.org/W2991643211,"Leydig cell functional capacity reflects the numbers and differentiation status of the steroidogenic Leydig cells in the testes and becomes more or less fixed in early adulthood with the final establishment of the hypothalamo-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis after puberty. Factors influencing Leydig cell functional capacity and its role in puberty are poorly understood. Using a bovine model of dairy bulls fed four different nutritional regimes from 1 month to 12 months, and applying circulating Insulin-like peptide 3 (INSL3) as an accurate biomarker of Leydig cell functional capacity, showed that a high plane of nutrition in the first 6 months of life, but not later, significantly increased INSL3 in young adulthood. Moreover, INSL3 concentration at 4 months indicated a marked differential in early feeding regime and correlated well (negatively) with the timing of puberty, as reflected by the age in days for the first production of an ejaculate with >50 million sperm and >10% forward motility, as well as with testis size at 18 months. Reversing the diet at 6 months was unable to rectify the trend in either parameter, unlike for other parameters such as testosterone, body weight, and scrotal circumference. This study has shown that early prepubertal nutrition is a key factor in the development of Leydig cell functional capacity in early adulthood and appears to be a key driver in the dynamic progression of puberty."
https://openalex.org/W2989779424,"Background Inadequate sterilization of reusable medical devices can lead to healthcare associated infections (HAIs) through person-to-person or environmental transmission of pathogens. Autoclaving (steam sterilization) is most commonly used for sterilizing medical devices in healthcare facilities. We conducted a nation-wide cross-sectional study to evaluate the effectiveness of steam sterilization practices in primary and secondary care public hospitals in Nepal and to identify factors associated with ineffective sterilization. Methods Using a stratified clustered random sampling, 13 primary- and secondary-care public hospitals in Nepal were selected. 189 steam sterilization cycles from these hospitals were evaluated for their effectiveness using self-contained biological indicators, class-5 chemical indicators, autoclave indicator tape and physical parameters. Information about the hospitals and the types of autoclaves being used was also collected. Data were analysed to estimate the proportion of ineffective steam sterilization cycles. Logistic regression was used to identify factors associated with ineffective sterilization. Findings In primary and secondary care public hospitals in Nepal, 71.0% (95% CI 46.8% - 87.2%) of the autoclave cycles were ineffective (i.e. showed positive results) when tested with biological indicators and 69.8% (95% CI 44.4% - 87.0%) showed ‘reject’ results with class 5 chemical indicators. There was no statistically significant difference in proportions showing positive or reject results by hospital types for either biological (p = 0.51) or class 5 chemical (p = 0.87) indicators. Autoclave type and pressure achieved during sterilization were statistically significantly associated with steam sterilization failures, adjusted for holding period, evenness of pressure and barrier system used. Conclusion Primary and secondary care hospitals in Nepal have a high proportion of steam sterilization failure, indicating a risk of person-to-person transmission of pathogens through reusable medical devices. There is an urgent need to improve steam sterilization processes in these hospitals."

In Cameroon, like in many developing countries, rubella surveillance is not well-established. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of rubella virus specific antibodies among pregnant Cameroonians. We conducted a cross-sectional study for rubella infection among pregnant women attending antenatal clinics in the Center and South-West regions of Cameroon. Demographic data and blood were collected and tested for rubella specific antibodies (IgG and IgM), and for the IgM positive cases, IgG avidity and real time PCR was done. From December 2015 to July 2017, 522 serum samples were collected and tested from pregnant women. The seroprevalence of rubella specific IgG was 94.4%, presumably due to immunity induced by wild-type rubella virus. The seroprevalence of rubella specific IgM was 5.0%, possibly indicating rubella infection. However, IgG avidity testing of the IgM positive cases detected high avidity IgGs, ranging from 52.37% to 87.70%, indicating past rubella infection. 5.6% (29/522) of the participants had negative results for IgG to rubella virus, indicating susceptibility to rubella infection. None of the participants had received a rubella containing vaccine (RCV), but 51% (266/522) of the pregnant women lived in a house with a child with records of at least one dose of RCV. Rubella virus RNA was not detected in the urine of any IgM positive case. Findings from this study show that rubella infection is significant in Cameroon. Some pregnant women are still susceptible to rubella infection. For a better management of rubella infection in pregnancy in Cameroon, consideration should be taken to investigate for IgG-avidity test in cases with positive rubella IgM result to distinguish between recent from past rubella infection."

https://openalex.org/W2991339175,"Background Oral self-care plays an important role in maintaining oral health and preventing the occurrence of oral diseases. The association between good oral care and good oral hygiene is well known. However, the adherence to a proper daily oral hygiene regimen generally remains poor, so the prevalence of oral diseases remains high. Periodontal disease is the most common oral disease in the population. To enhance the adherence to good oral hygiene behaviors for patients with periodontal disease, we developed a personalized and evidence-based mobile application as an intervention tool for the purpose of initiating and improving good oral self-care. Objective The objective of this study was to demonstrate the systematic development process and content of the oral self-care mobile application, OSCA. Methods The systematic development process of OSCA consists of three phases: behavioral diagnosis, intervention design, and assessment of OSCA. Firstly, behavioral problem of oral self-care was identified by the experts in periodontics care. Secondly, the intervention functions and the mode of delivery were designed based on the capability-opportunity-motivation behavioral model, which is the underpinning model behind the behavior change wheel framework. Thirdly, the developed app was evaluated by the experts through a heuristics evaluation checklist by adopting Morville’s Honeycomb model, and the final version of OSCA was assessed by the patients with periodontal disease using the System Usability Scale (SUS). Results The problems of target behavior were identified and incorporated into the design of intervention functions. For the beta version of the OSCA, experts proposed four main suggestions to improve the usefulness. Experts evaluated the beta and final versions of the app using a heuristics evaluation checklist, providing mean scores of 4.38 and 4.62, respectively. For usability testing, 87 participants completed both the specified tasks and the SUS questionnaire, providing an SUS median score of 77.5 (IQR = 12.5) and an overall mean completion time of 12.22 minutes for the specified tasks. The mean scores of the intervention functions for capability establishment, motivation enhancement, and opportunity creation were 6.13, 5.88, and 6.06, respectively. Conclusions The study presents a rigorous design process of developing an evidence-based and personalized mobile application for oral self-care. The results of the expert evaluation confirmed the validated design and the participants were satisfied with the designed app."
https://openalex.org/W2989943700,"Rabbits with naturally high levels of cholesterol ester transfer protein (CETP), unlike rodents, have become an interesting animal model for the study of lipid metabolism and atherosclerosis, as they have similarities to humans in lipid metabolism, cardiovascular physiology and susceptibility to develop atherosclerosis. Rodents, such as mice, are not prone to atherosclerosis as they lack the mass and activity of CETP, as a key player in lipoprotein metabolism. Recently, APOE-knockout in rabbits has been shown to promote atherosclerosis and associated premature IVD degeneration that mimic the symptoms of atherosclerosis and structural changes of IVDs in humans. Here we examined whether APOE-knockout promoted IVD degeneration in rabbits is associated with imbalanced inflammatory catabolic activities, as the underlying problem of biological deterioration that mimic the symptoms of advanced IVD degeneration in humans. We analysed in lumbar nucleus pulposus (NP) of APOE-knockout rabbits the cell viabilities and the intracellular levels of inflammatory, catabolic, anti-catabolic and anabolic proteins derogating IVD matrix. Grades of IVD degeneration were evaluated by magnetic resonance imaging. NP cells were isolated from homozygous APOE-knockout and wild-type New Zealand White rabbits of similar age. Three-dimensional cell culture with low-glucose was completed in alginate hydrogel. Cell proliferation and intracellular levels of target proteins were examined by MTT and ELISA assays. Alike human NP cells of different disc degeneration grades, NP cells of APOE-knockout and wild-type rabbits showed significantly different in vivo cell population densities (p<0.0001) and similar in vitro proliferation rates. Furthermore, they showed differences in overexpression of selective inflammatory and catabolic proteins (p<0.0001) similar to those found in human NP cells of different disc degeneration grades, such as IL-1β, TNF-α, ADAMTS-4, ADAMTS-5 and MMP-3. This study showed that premature IVD degeneration in APOE-knockout rabbits was promoted by the accumulation of selective inflammatory catabolic factors that enhanced imbalances between catabolic and anabolic factors mimicking the symptoms of advanced IVD degeneration in humans. Thus, APOE-knockout rabbits could be used as a promising model for therapeutic approaches of degenerative disc disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2990700526,"Outbreaks of moon jellyfish Aurelia spp. are frequently reported from many parts of the world’s coastal areas. Aurelia spp. canonically show a metagenetic life cycle in which planulae transform into sessile polyps, which can drastically increase in number through asexual reproduction. Therefore, their asexual reproduction has been recognized as one of the major causes of the outbreaks. Aurelia spp. also show direct development that lacks asexual reproduction during the polyp stage, which prevents us from understanding the mechanisms of its outbreaks. To clarify the seasonality of the metagenetic and direct-development life cycles of Aurelia sp. in Maizuru Bay, Japan, we conducted field observations and laboratory experiments throughout the year. Additionally, the two life cycle types were genetically analyzed to confirm that they belong to the single species Aurelia coerulea, which dominates in coastal waters in Japan. From July until October, Aurelia coerulea produced smaller eggs and planulae all of which developed into polyps. However, from December until May, larger eggs and planulae were produced and 90% of the planulae developed into planktonic ephyrae bypassing the sessile polyp stage. Our results demonstrated that a single species, A. coerulea, seasonally shifts between their two life cycle types at a water temperature threshold of 20°C in Maizuru Bay. The higher energy storage of larger planulae was suggested to enable the planulae to develop into ephyrae without external energy input through feeding during the polyp stage. The adaptive significances of the two life cycle types were also discussed."

However, this population is markedly understudied, and even basic knowledge of the species' feeding habits is deficient. Wolf diet was assessed based on 236 scat samples collected between November 2013 and October 2014, by following pre-established transects (total length = 774 km). The study area (600 km2) is a multi-prey ecosystem in the southern sector of the Eastern Romanian Carpathians. Our results emphasize that more than 80% of the wolf diet is based on wild ungulates. The wild boar is clearly selected (D = 0.74) and is the most common species in the diet (Bio = 72%), while roe deer (Bio = 10%) and red deer (Bio = 5%) have a smaller contribution. Domestic species represented the second-largest prey category in both seasons. Among them, dog is a particularly important source of food (Bio 3.5-10.9%). Other domestic species (goat, sheep, horse) have marginal importance in the wolf diet and seasonal occurrence. Standardized niche breadths are low in both seasons (BAw = 0.07, BAs = 0.12), and a high degree of overlap in the resources used has been observed (Ôws = 0.99). Our study represents the first step towards understanding the wolf foraging behaviour in the Romanian Carpathians and is valuable to address the complex issues of wolf and wild ungulate population management and conservation."
https://openalex.org/W2990584396,"Endothelial cells have key functions in endothelial barrier integrity and in responses to angiogenic signals that promote cell proliferation, cell migration, cytoskeletal reorganization, and formation of new blood vessels. These functions highly depend on protein–protein interactions in cell–cell junction and cell attachment complexes and on interactions with cytoskeletal proteins. Protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) dephosphorylates several target proteins involved in cytoskeletal dynamics and cell adhesion. Our goal was to find new interacting and substrate proteins of the PP2A-B55α holoenzyme in bovine pulmonary endothelial cells. Using LC-MS/MS analysis, we identified flotillin-1 as a protein that binds recombinant GSH S-transferase–tagged PP2A-B55α. Immunoprecipitation experiments, proximity ligation assays, and immunofluorescent staining confirmed the interaction between these two endogenous proteins in endothelial cells. Originally, flotillins were described as regulatory proteins for axon regeneration, but they appear to function in many cellular processes, such as membrane receptor signaling, endocytosis, and cell adhesion. Ser315 is a known PKC-targeted site in flotillin-1. Utilizing phosphomutants of flotillin-1 and the NanoBiT luciferase assay, we show here that phosphorylation/dephosphorylation of Ser315 in flotillin-1 significantly affects its interaction with PP2A-B55α and that PP2A-B55α dephosphorylates phospho-Ser315.

A total of 483 small rodents were captured using snap traps placed at 11 regions in Croatia. Sampling was undertaken in 2008 and repeated from 2010 to 2014. Liver samples were tested for the presence of HEV RNA. HEV RNA was detected in only one liver sample (0.21%) originated from Apodemus flavicollis from the location Medvednica, nearby Zagreb collected in 2014. According to the sequence analysis, the isolate has shown to be a member of Orthohepevirus A species, genotype HEV-3. The genotyping results confirmed grouping into subtype 3a, general cluster 3abchij.The detected HEV strain showed to be genetically highly related to strains found in humans and/or domestic pigs and wild boars from Croatia. Our finding indicates that wild small mammals could play a role in the epidemiology of HEV-3 infection and therefore should be taken under consideration as potential reservoirs or/and transmitters of the disease. However, further investigation is needed to recognize their potential for maintaining the infection in natural conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2990280673,"In recent years, spread of invasive alien plant species (IAPS) has been a major concern in Nepal. One such IAPS is Ageratum houstonianum, an Asteraceae, that is a prolific seed producer and difficult-to-control in farmland and various ecological regions causing crop yield and biodiversity losses. However, very little information is available on the germination biology and ecology of this species. Therefore, experiments were conducted to assess the effect of water stress, pH level, and light requirement on seed germination, and the effect of seed burial depth on seedling emergence. Water stress was simulated by polyethylene glycol solutions ranging from 0–5.56 MPa and pH solutions ranging from 4 to 9 were prepared using hydrochloric acid and sodium hydroxide. Germination tests were conducted in petri dishes lined with filter paper and placed in a controlled environment chamber set at 20° C. Light requirement comparisons were made by having petri dishes wrapped with aluminum foil or left unwrapped. Seedling emergence was evaluated by placing seeds at depths ranging from 0 to 20 mm in the soil. Results indicated that this species was moderately drought-tolerant because germination ceased beyond 0.51 MPa. Greater germination occurred at neutral to acidic than at alkaline pH levels. The seeds were positively photoblastic because no germination occurred under dark condition. No seedlings emerged from seeds placed more than 2 mm deep in the soil, indicating that this is a primarily surface germinating species. These findings will help predict future invasions and in development of management strategies for this IAPS."

P. aeruginosa adhesion to host epithelial cells is enhanced by surface-exposed translation elongation factor EF-Tu carrying a Lys-5 trimethylation, incorporated by the methyltransferase EftM. Thus, the EF-Tu modification by EftM may represent a target to prevent P. aeruginosa infections in vulnerable individuals. Here, we extend our understanding of EftM activity by defining the molecular mechanism by which it recognizes EF-Tu. Acting on the observation that EftM can bind to EF-Tu lacking its N-terminal peptide (encompassing the Lys-5 target site), we generated an EftM homology model and used it in protein/protein docking studies to predict EftM/EF-Tu interactions. Using site-directed mutagenesis of residues in both proteins, coupled with binding and methyltransferase activity assays, we experimentally validated the predicted protein/protein interface. We also show that EftM cannot methylate the isolated N-terminal EF-Tu peptide and that binding-induced conformational changes in EftM are likely needed to enable placement of the first 5–6 amino acids of EF-Tu into a conserved peptide-binding channel in EftM. In this channel, a group of residues that are highly conserved in EftM proteins position the N-terminal sequence to facilitate Lys-5 modification. Our findings reveal that EftM employs molecular strategies for substrate recognition common among both class I (Rossmann fold) and class II (SET domain) methyltransferases and pave the way for studies seeking a deeper understanding of EftM's mechanism of action on EF-Tu.

The bacterial methyltransferase CheR serves as the paradigm for environmental adaptation behavior arising from protein methylation (4García-Fontana C. Corral Lugo A. Krell T.

In many enteric bacteria, response to chemical stimuli occurs via O-methylation of glutamic acid residues on chemotaxis receptors by CheR. Bacterial methyltransferases can also directly influence host gene expression and host/pathogen interaction. For example, Mycobacterium tuberculosis expresses a secreted 5-methylcytosine–specific DNA methyltransferase (Rv2966c) that directly modifies the host epigenetic machinery to alter transcription (5Sharma G. Upadhyay S. Srilalitha M. Nandicoori V.K. Khosla S. The interaction of mycobacterial protein Rv2966c with host chromatin is mediated through non-CpG methylation and histone H3/H4 binding.Nucleic Acids Res. 2015; 43 (25824946): 3922-393710.1093/nar/gkv261Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Establishment of infection can also be both negatively and positively regulated by methylation of bacterial surface proteins by host- or pathogen-derived methyltransferases. The human protein SUV39H1, for example, methylates the crucial surface-exposed mycobacterial protein HupB, which reduces bacterial adhesion and survival inside the host cell (6Yaseen I. Choudhury M.

Whereas the roles for protein methylation in bacterial virulence and host/pathogen interactions are emerging, there is generally less known about the molecular mechanisms that control substrate recognition and catalysis by the bacterial methyltransferase enzymes that incorporate these PTMs. The Gram-negative environmental bacterium P. aeruginosa is an opportunistic pathogen that causes serious respiratory, eye, and skin infections in vulnerable individuals, such as those with cystic fibrosis, compromised immune systems, or severe burns. P. aeruginosa is also intrinsically resistant to many antibiotics making infections difficult to treat once established. However, precisely how P. aeruginosa establishes infection in a host and adapts to its new environment is still not fully understood. A more complete understanding of this process could potentially identify novel strategies to restrict the establishment of infection. Toward this goal, we previously described trimethylation of EF-Tu on Lys-5 as a PTM that enhances P. aeruginosa host-cell adherence and infection (8Owings J.P. Kuiper E.G. Prezioso S.M. Meisner J.

In contrast, some chronic isolates, such as PAHM4, retain their ability to methylate EF-Tu at 37 °C (11Barbier M. Oliver A. Rao J. Hanna S.L. Goldberg J.B. Albertí S. Novel phosphorylcholine-containing protein of Pseudomonas aeruginosa chronic infection isolates interacts with airway epithelial cells.J. Infect.

Together, these observations suggest that the major role of the Lys-5 PTM may be to modulate a “moonlighting” function of EF-Tu in host-cell adhesion by P. aeruginosa. Here, we define the mechanism of EF-Tu substrate recognition by EftM. Evolutionary sequence analyses and computational modeling of EftM and the EftM/EF-Tu complex were used to direct mutagenesis and functional studies to identify the protein/protein binding interface, revealing that EftM requires more than just the N-terminal sequence of EF-Tu to bind and methylate its substrate. We also identify conserved residues in a substrate-binding channel that position the N-terminal sequence of EF-Tu for trimethylation on Lys-5. Collectively, our findings lead to a new mechanistic model for EftM/EF-Tu recognition reliant on both protein/protein docking and protein conformational changes to accommodate the EF-Tu N-terminal sequence, which together direct specific substrate recognition and modification. These functional studies represent an important step toward a better understanding of the molecular recognition mechanism of EftM and bacterial lysine methyltransferases in general. We previously reported that the temperature sensitivity of EF-Tu methylation by EftM in P. aeruginosa strain PAO1 (EftMPAO1) is due, at least in part, to the direct unfolding of the methyltransferase upon transition from environment-like (25 °C) to host-like (37 °C) temperatures (8Owings J.P. Kuiper E.G. Prezioso S.M. Meisner J. Varga J.J. Zelinskaya N. Dammer E.B. Duong D.M. Seyfried N.T. Albertí S. Conn G.L. Goldberg J.B.

This direct thermolability also likely contributed to challenges we encountered in expression, purification, and handling of EftMPAO1 for biochemical and biophysical studies. Therefore, we decided to examine the folding and functional properties of the same enzyme (EftMHM4) from the chronic infection strain of P. aeruginosa PAHM4 in which EF-Tu methylation was previously observed at 37 °C (9Barbier M. Owings J.P. Martínez-Ramos I. Damron F.H. Gomila R. Blazquez J. Goldberg J.B. Albertí S. Lysine trimethylation of EF-Tu mimics platelet-activating factor to initiate Pseudomonas aeruginosa pneumonia.MBio. 2013; 4 (23653444): e00207-1310.1128/mBio.00207-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Using differential-scanning fluorimetry (DSF) we found that the Tm of EftMHM4 is increased by ∼5 °, to 37 °C (Fig. 1A), compared with the 31.5 °C that we determined previously for EftMPAO1 (8Owings J.P. Kuiper E.G. Prezioso S.M. Meisner J. Varga J.J. Zelinskaya N. Dammer E.B. Duong D.M. Seyfried N.T. Albertí S. Conn G.L. Goldberg J.B. Pseudomonas aeruginosa EftM is a thermoregulated methyltransferase.J. Biol.

Additionally, as observed for EftMPAO1, S-adenosyl-l-methionine (SAM) stabilizes EftMHM4 by ∼5 °C resulting in an unfolding Tm of 41.5 °C in the presence of the cosubstrate. Next, we asked whether this additional thermal stability of EftMHM4 directly correlates with its activity at an elevated temperature. As expected, EftMHM4 retained enzymatic activity after incubation at either 25 or 37 °C, as observed previously, but its activity was ablated after incubation at 42 °C for 5 min or more (Fig. 1B). Collectively, these data show the retained methylation of EF-Tu in PAHM4 at 37 °C is due to an increase in the thermostability of EftM methyltransferase by ∼5°, which allows the enzyme to remain active at the elevated temperature. Critically, these findings also show that EftMPAO1 and EftMHM4 are functionally equivalent enzymes and that the latter still exhibits thermoregulation but shifted to higher temperature. As there is no known structure of any EftM family member, we searched for structures of the closest paralogs and identified the N,N-dimethyltransferase DesVI from Streptomyces venezuelae (PDB code 3BXO), which methylates a sugar intermediate in macrolide antibiotic biosynthesis, dTDP-3-amino-3,6-dideoxy-α-d-glucopyranose (12Burgie E.S. Holden H.M. Three-dimensional structure of DesVI from Streptomyces venezuelae: a sugar N,N-dimethyltransferase required for dTDP-desosamine biosynthesis.Biochemistry. 2008; 47 (18327916): 3982-398810.1021/bi800063jCrossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). DesVI is 25.3% identical and 36.7% similar to EftMHM4 as calculated in EMBL EMBOSS, with both values ∼1% higher compared with EftMPAO1. A combined approach of homology modeling and threading was used, followed by energy minimization, to generate structural models of EftMPAO1 and EftMHM4. This combination of methods, which is applicable to modeling in instances of relatively modest sequence identity, together with the high-structural conservation of the Class I methyltransferase fold allowed generation of models of good quality as the basis for experimental analyses. The essentially identical modeled EftMPAO1 and EftMHM4 structures each consist of two domains: a Class I (Rossmann fold) methyltransferase domain containing a central seven-stranded β-sheet and an auxiliary domain comprising the N-terminal α-helix and a three-stranded antiparallel β-sheet formed by an extended sequence that links the fifth and sixth strands (β5/6 linker) of the core fold (Fig. 2). The EftM models displayed the expected similarities with the structure of the DesVI modeling template but also revealed some important potential differences. In particular, the substrate-binding channel of EftM is substantially enlarged, consistent with its binding of an extended substrate (i.e. the N-terminal sequence of EF-Tu). As the structure of DesVI was solved with the methyltransferase cosubstrate SAM, the model also revealed the likely location of cosubstrate and the surrounding catalytic center of EftM (Fig. 2, B and C). The amino acid sequences of EftMHM4 and EftMPAO1 are 96.4% similar and 88.7% identical, with 28 amino acids that vary between the two enzymes (Fig. 3). Almost all of these 28 amino acid differences occur on the periphery of the enzyme suggesting that a network of interactions may be responsible for the increased stability of the EftMHM4, rather than one or a small number of individual amino acid changes. However, it is noteworthy that the changes involving the most physicochemically dissimilar amino acids are clustered in a region that connects the core methyltransferase fold and the auxiliary domain in the EftM model (Fig. 3, red spheres). This suggests a possible difference in regulation of protein flexibility between EftMHM4 and EftMPAO1, which might be responsible, at least in part, for the thermostabilization of EftMHM4. In summary, EftMHM4 exhibits conserved activity, retained thermoregulation but with increased thermostability, and is predicted to have identical structure compared with the previously characterized thermolabile methyltransferase EftMPAO1. Coupled with its greater ease of expression, purification, and handling, these factors lead us to use EftMHM4 as the optimal context to complete the detailed study described herein of EF-Tu recognition by EftM. To begin defining EF-Tu recognition by EftM, we first asked whether important interactions are made with the surface of the globular protein fold of EF-Tu or whether the isolated N-terminal peptide (1MAKEKFERNKP11; trimethylated Lys-5 is in bold font and underlined) alone is a suitable substrate for modification. First, a variant of P. aeruginosa EF-Tu lacking the first 11 amino acids of the N terminus (Δ11-EF-Tu) was generated to assess contributions of the EF-Tu surface to binding by EftM. To qualitatively assess binding, we compared the ability of EftM to form a stable complex with EF-Tu or Δ11-EF-Tu using gel-filtration chromatography (Fig. 4, A and B). Complexes of both EftM/EF-Tu and EftM/Δ11-EF-Tu were observed to elute from the column before either free component due to their larger size, suggesting that EftM is able to bind the truncated EF-Tu protein. We next quantified the binding affinity of EftM to WT P. aeruginosa EF-Tu and the Δ11-EF-Tu truncated construct using isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC). The binding affinity (KD) measured for EftM and WT EF-Tu was relatively weak (∼27 μm; Table 1) as would be anticipated given the very high levels of the translation factor in bacterial cells. Remarkably, a similar affinity was also obtained with the truncated EF-Tu protein (Table 1), consistent with retained interaction even in the absence of the EF-Tu N-terminal sequence. Interestingly, however, although the weak binding precludes accurate determination of binding enthalpy (ΔH), binding of EftM to Δ11-EF-Tu appears to have a significantly lower ΔH (>10-fold lower) than for WT EF-Tu (Fig. 4C). This difference suggests binding-induced changes in the EF-Tu N-terminal peptide or EftM structure occur upon protein/protein interaction even though the EF-Tu N-terminal peptide does not appear to directly contribute to the binding affinity of the complex.Table 1EF-Tu and SAM/SAH-binding affinities of wildtype and tryptophan variant EftMHM4Binding affinity (KD, μm)SubstrateCosubstrateEF-TuΔ11-EF-TuSAMSAHEftM27.9 ± 16.025.917.0 ± 7.023.4 ± 2.7EftM-W170F19.3 ± 9.519.9 ± 6.2EftM-W196F24.0 ± 12.726.0 ± 0.2 Open table in a new tab In a complementary approach, we used mass spectroscopy (MS) to discern whether peptides corresponding to the isolated N-terminal peptide sequence of P. aeruginosa EF-Tu could be methylated by EftM. Samples containing 10-mer peptide (1MAKEKFERNK10) alone or after incubation with EftM/SAM were subject to MALDI-TOF MS analysis. In both spectra, peaks corresponding to the unmethylated peptide (m/z 1280) were identified, but no methylated peptides were detected (predicted m/z 1294, 1308, and 1322 for mono-, di-, and trimethylated peptide, respectively), even in the presence of enzyme and SAM (Fig. 4D). We additionally tested a shorter peptide (1MAKEKF6) that corresponds more precisely to the sequence we predict is accommodated within the EftM peptide-binding channel (see below). Although synthetic trimethylated peptide (1MAKEKMe3F6) could be detected, demonstrating our ability to measure Lys-5–modified peptides by MS, only unmethylated peptide was detected after treatment with EftM and SAM (Fig. S1), as for the longer sequence. In summary, gel-filtration and ITC data show that EftM can bind EF-Tu lacking its N-terminal sequence, whereas MS analysis also reveals that EftM cannot methylate an isolated EF-Tu N-terminal peptide sequence. Together, these observations point to a critical role for an extended surface of the globular body of EF-Tu in substrate recognition by EftM. We next generated a computational model of the EftM/EF-Tu complex using the protein/protein docking software HEX 6.0 (13Macindoe G. Mavridis L. Venkatraman V. Devignes M.D. Ritchie D.W. HexServer: an FFT-based protein docking server powered by graphics processors.Nucleic Acids Res. 2010; 38 (20444869): W445-W44910.1093/nar/gkq311Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). To generate this model, a structure corresponding to Δ11-EF-Tu was first created by deletion of N-terminal residues in the structure of P. aeruginosa EF-Tu (PDB code 4ZV4). Potential models of Δ11-EF-Tu bound to EftMHM4 generated by HEX 6.0 were ranked according to calculated energies for shape and electrostatic complementarity. The top-scoring prediction was manually adjusted, e.g. by selection of optimal side-chain rotamers, to remove obvious clashes before energy minimization to generate the final model of the EftM/Δ11-EF-Tu complex (Fig. 5, A and B). The final model was assessed based on amino acid evolutionary conservation within the EftM family, revealing a moderately-conserved surface of EftMHM4 that is predicted to interact with EF-Tu (Fig. 5, B and C). In contrast, the predicted solvent-exposed surface of EftM exhibited lower overall conservation, whereas the predicted openings to the EF-Tu N-terminal peptide-binding channel have much higher amino acid conservation as would be expected for this functionally critical region of the enzyme (Fig. S2). The putative EftM/Δ11-EF-Tu binding interface is stabilized by multiple electrostatic interactions made by EftMHM4 residues Asp-76, Arg-81, Asp-91, and Asp-98. To experimentally test the role of these residues in EF-Tu binding, each was altered with a charge-reversal substitution (i.e. Arg to Glu or Asp to Lys). Additionally, His-86 within the same surface was substituted with Ala. This group of residues is distributed across most of the predicted interaction interface (Fig. 5B). Variant EftMHM4 proteins were expressed and purified as for the WT protein, and their folding was assessed using thermal denaturation monitored by intrinsic fluorescence. Each protein had a similar unfolding profile and inflection point melting temperature (Ti; within ±5 °C) compared with WT EftMHM4 consistent with their correct folding. Additionally, because each substituted residue is located on the EftMHM4 protein surface and distant from both the SAM-binding pocket and EF-Tu N-terminal peptide-binding channel, we therefore ascribe any observed decrease in trimethylation activity to weakening of the binding interaction between EftMHM4 and its EF-Tu substrate at this predicted surface. To measure trimethylation of EF-Tu by the variant EftMHM4 proteins, we used the established immunoblot assay with an anti-trimethyllysine antibody. First, to determine the optimal reaction conditions for comparison with WT EftMHM4, a time-course activity assay was performed using WT EftMHM4 (0.25 μm) in the presence of excess EF-Tu substrate (10 μm) and SAM cosubstrate (1 mm). This experiment revealed that under the conditions used, EF-Tu trimethylation neared completion at ∼30 min (Fig. 5D), and this single time point was selected for use in all subsequent methylation assays. D91K, D98K, and H86A substitutions in EftMHM4 resulted in a severely reduced ability to trimethylate EF-Tu (Fig. 5E), with activity decreased to ∼16, 13, and 17%, respectively, compared with WT EftMHM4 (Fig. 5E). D76K and R81E substitutions also caused a reduced ability to methylate EF-Tu, to ∼40, and 15%, respectively, although double substitution of these residues in EftMHM4-D76K/R81E further lowered activity to ∼7%. We next made individual substitutions of residues Glu-69 and Arg-208 in EF-Tu, which are predicted by the model of the complex to be near EftMHM4 residues Asp-76 and Arg-81, respectively. Consistent with the effects of the corresponding changes in EftMHM4, charge-reversal substitutions E69K and R208E in EF-Tu also resulted in reduced methylation activity by WT EftM, dropping to ∼55 and 20%, respectively (Fig. 5E). The double mutant, EF-Tu-E69K/R208E, again showed a more pronounced decrease in methylation activity (to ∼11% of WT), mirroring the effects of the corresponding substitutions in EftM. Collectively, the activities of the EftMHM4 variants with targeted substitutions, and of WT EftM on variant EF-Tu proteins with corresponding changes, experimentally validate the predicted protein/protein interaction interface in our computational model of the EftM/Δ11/EF-Tu complex. Using our model of the EftM/EF-Tu complex, we next asked how the EF-Tu N-terminal peptide might be positioned in EftM's substrate-binding channel. The EftMHM4 homology model has its substrate-binding channel in a similar location to that observed in the DesVI structure but with an overall larger volume and distinct surface shape and charge distribution. The residues lining the substrate-binding channel, Tyr-7, Asp-15, Met-74, Trp-170, and Trp-196 (Fig. 6A and Fig. S2B), are highly conserved (>90%), whereas Asp-20 near the opening of the channel is also conserved (82.4%) in EftM family proteins. Additionally, although these residues are conserved in the EftM family, they are less highly conserved in DesVI and other paralogs, highlighting their potential role in interactions with the EF-Tu N-terminal peptide. Near the center of the channel, EftM also accommodates the SAM cosubstrate in an orientation consistent with other Rossmann fold methyltransferases, in which the methyl group is oriented toward the opening of the substrate channel adjacent to the modeled EF-Tu N terminus (Fig. 6B). The cavity within EftM that forms the EF-Tu N-terminal peptide-binding channel appears large enough to accommodate the first six residues of EF-Tu (1MAKEKF6) with some distinctive surface po"

Blocking myostatin to drive muscle growth is one potential therapeutic approach. While the effects of myostatin depletion on muscle characteristics are well established, we have very little understanding of its effects on the neural system. Here we assess the effects of long-term, post-developmental myostatin reduction on electrophysiological motor unit characteristics and body composition in aging mice. We used male (N = 21) and female (N = 26) mice containing a tetracycline-inducible system to delete the myostatin gene in skeletal muscle. Starting at 12 months of age, half of the mice were administered doxycycline (tetracycline) through their chow for one year. During that time we measured food intake, body composition, and hindlimb electromyographic responses. Doxycycline-induced myostatin reduction had no effect on motor unit properties for either sex, though significant age-dependent declines in motor unit number occurred in all mice. However, treatment with doxycycline induced different changes in body composition between sexes. All female mice increased in total, lean and fat mass, but doxycycline-treated female mice experienced a significantly larger increase in lean mass than controls. All male mice also increased total and lean mass, but administration of doxycycline had no effect. Additionally, doxycycline-treated male mice maintained their fat mass at baseline levels, while the control group experienced a significant increase from baseline and compared to the doxycycline treated group. Our results show that long-term administration of doxycycline results in body composition adaptations that are distinctive between male and female mice, and that the effects of myostatin reduction are most pronounced during the first three months of treatment. We also report that age-related changes in motor unit number are not offset by reduced myostatin levels, despite increased lean mass exhibited by female mice."
https://openalex.org/W2990003986,"Background Antiretroviral therapy (ART) has improved the survival of HIV infected persons. However, rapid scale-up of ART and the high HIV-1 genetic variability, has greatly influenced the emergence of drug-resistant strains. This constitutes a potential threat to achieving the UNAIDS’ 90-90-90 goals by 2020. We investigated the prevalent HIV-1 genotypes, drug resistance-associated mutations and assessed some predictors of the occurrence of these mutations. Methods This was a hospital-based cross-sectional study conducted between October 2010 and June 2012. Participants were consecutively enrolled from selected HIV treatment centers of the Southwest and Northwest regions of Cameroon. Viral load was determined with the automated Abbott Real-time HIV-1 m2000rt System. HIV genotyping and antiretroviral resistance mutations analysis were performed using Bayer’s HIV-1 TRUGENE™ Genotyping Kit and OpenGene DNA Sequencing system. The drug resistance mutation was interpreted with the Stanford HIV database. Epidemiological data were obtained using pre-tested semi-structured questionnaires. Results Of the 387 participants, 239 were successfully genotyped. The median age of these participants was 33 years (interquartile range, IQR: 28–40 years), and a majority (65.7%) were female. A total of 29.3% of the participants were receiving ART. The median duration of ART was 10.5 months (IQR: 4–17.25 months). The median CD4 count and log10 viral load of study participants were 353.5 cells/ml (IQR:145–471) and 4.89 copies/ml (IQR: 3.91–5.55) respectively. CRF02 (A/G) (69%) was the most prevalent subtype followed by G (8.2%) and F (6.7%). Overall, resistance mutations were present in 37.1% of ART-experienced and 10.7% of ART-naive patients. Nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI) mutations occurred in 30% of ART-experienced and 2.4% of ART-naïve patients, while non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI) mutations occurred in 34.2% of ART-experienced and 10.1% of -naïve patients. M184V (8.4%, 20/239) and K103N (5.4%, 13/239) were the most prevalent mutations. Major protease inhibitor mutations occurred in 3 (1.3%) out of the 239 sequences. The duration of ART independently predicted the occurrence of resistance mutation among ART-experienced patients. Conclusion The high resistance to NNRTIs, which are the main support to the backbone (NRTIs) first-line antiretroviral regimen in Cameroon, has prompted the need to rollout an integrase strand transfer inhibitor regimen (containing Dolutegravir) with a higher genetic barrier to resistance as the preferred first line regimen."
https://openalex.org/W2989696507,"The study aim was to assess the reliability to active trunk movements measurement in four sitting positions in wheelchair basketball players and to check their trunk movements in these positions. Eighteen volunteer wheelchair basketball athletes, with a minimum of five years' training experience, were asked to perform the maximum range of active trunk movement in three planes in four sitting positions (in a sports wheelchair with straps, without straps, on a table with feet on the floor, on a table without foot support). The range of movement was measured by the Kinect for Windows V2 sensor twice (with one-week interval). To assess the reliability, different statistical methods were used for each movement: significance of differences between the results (p-value), interclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and minimal detectable change (MDC). The limits of agreement analysis (LOA) were calculated. Differences between trunk movements in four positions were checked by the MANOVA (Wilk's Lambda and ETA2 were calculated if data were normally distributed). The significance level was set at α < .05. Friedman ANOVA and non-parametric Wilcoxon test with the Bonferroni correction were applied when data were not normally distributed. The significance level after Bonferroni correction was set at α < .013 (α = p/k, where p = .05, k-number of positions = 4). The measurement of active trunk movement in each plane was reliable (p > .05, no differences between the results, ""very good""ICC, between .96-.99). In the position with straps, the trunk movement was significantly bigger than in other positions (p < .05), except for the position without straps (p > .05). The Kinect for Windows V2 sensor measured active trunk movement in a reliable manner and it can be recommended as a reliable tool for measuring trunk function. Utilizing straps by wheelchair basketball players increases their trunk movement."
https://openalex.org/W2990397386,"New Zealand sea lions (Phocarctos hookeri) are an endemic and endangered species. Pup mortality at Enderby Island (50.5°S, 166.28°E) in the New Zealand sub-Antarctic has been well studied, with subsequent investigations yielding more intricate detail of the causes of mortality, as new diagnostic methods become available. Klebsiella pneumoniae was first reported in 2001-02 at this site, causing a pup mortality epizootic and is now known to be present at several colonies. This bacterium is a common mucosal commensal of humans and animals, however the agent found in pups at necropsy is a hypervirulent strain, readily recognised in microbial culture as being hypermucoviscous. Infection causes septicaemia with a common syndrome of subsequent meningitis and polyarthritis. This investigation uses histopathology and microbiology, with new modalities such as matrix assisted laser desorption/ionisation-time of flight mass spectrometry to show that Klebsiella septicaemia could have historically been, and continues to be, the most important cause of pup mortality, but has been previously underrepresented due to the often cryptic presentation and sometimes peracute course of disease. Hypermucoviscous K. pneumoniae should be considered a serious threat to pup survival in the species, causing on average 60.2% of pup deaths annually at Enderby Island between 2013 and 2018, with likely more continuing mortality following pup dispersal and the cessation of the summer monitoring season. Less common causes of death included starvation (14.8%), trauma/asphyxiation (9.9%) and other infections (7%). This study forms the basis for further evaluation of risk factors for pup mortality in the species, with a view to developing active mitigation."
https://openalex.org/W2990564719,"Species within the same trophic level show different strategies to avoid competition. Among these mechanisms, differences in body size, spatio-temporal segregation, and diet preference often leads to a niche partitioning. Nonetheless, little attention on coexisting predatory insects and their network interactions has been paid. In this study, we analyzed the strategies to avoid competition among three sympatric mud-daubing wasps of the genus Trypoxylon (Hymenoptera: Crabronidae) in oases and their surrounding xeric area from the Baja California peninsula, Mexico. We compared the prey richness, composition and proportion of spider guilds that were captured by the wasps. We tested whether the differences in wasp body size explained the niche breadth, niche overlap and the size of spider prey. We assessed the spider-wasp interactions through a network analysis. With the use of trap-nests, we collected 52 spider species captured by the wasps. Both the guild and species composition of preyed spiders was different between the three wasp species. Differential proportions in the capture of spider guilds and a little diet overlap were found among the wasp species. We found that the wasp body size was positively correlated with prey size, but it was not a proxy of niche breadth. Moreover, the largest wasp species was able to nest in both mesic and xeric habitats, while the two smaller species were restricted to the oases. This study reveals that the diversity of spiders in oases of Baja California peninsula is crucial to maintain highly specialized oasis-dependent wasp species. The niche partitioning between mud-daubing wasps can be shaped by their inherent body size limitations and hunting strategies through foraging specialization for specific spider guilds. Food selection and slight differences in body size reduce competition and allow the coexistence of sympatric wasps. Our study is the first approach exploring the interaction networks between mud-daubing wasps and their spider preys, highlighting new insights into the morphological and ecological factors that shape antagonistic interactions, and allow the coexistence of predators in deserts."
https://openalex.org/W2990658219,"Animals in urban environments face challenging situations and have to cope with human activities. This study investigated the ecology and behaviour of a population of European hamsters (Cricetus cricetus) living in the city centre of Vienna (Austria). We recorded the surface activities of 35 hamsters in May 2015. Each focal animal was observed for 15 minutes, and a total of 66 focal samples were analysable. As a prey species in an environment teeming with human activities, we predicted a high level of vigilance by the hamsters. The results show that while animals dedicated a lot of time to vigilance, most of their time was spent foraging. The study also explores whether the frequency of vigilance behaviours differ between males and females. We found that vigilance behaviours were expressed in a different manner by males and females. Finally, we investigated the distribution of the burrows on green spaces depending on proximity to trees and on noise levels. We found a biased distribution of burrows, with a spatial preference for location protected by the vegetation and distant to noise sources. Although burrows were located preferentially under vegetation cover, levels of noise did not determine their positions. Moreover, this species does not respond to disturbances like daily urban noises, probably due to habituation. The common hamster is an endangered species; our results lead to a greater knowledge of its behaviour in a persistent urban population."
https://openalex.org/W2990991336,"HIV programs are increasingly confronted with failing antiretroviral therapy (ART), including second-line regimens. WHO has provided guidelines on switching to third-line ART. In a Médecins Sans Frontières clinic in Mumbai, India, receiving referred presumptive second-line ART failure cases, an evidence-based protocol consisting of viral load (VL) testing, enhanced adherence counselling (EAC) and genotype for switching was implemented.To document the outcome and genotype of presumptive second-line ART failure cases switched to third-line or maintained on second-line ART.Retrospective cohort study of patients referred between January 2011 and September 2017.The cases (n = 120) were complex with median 9.2 years of ART exposure, poor adherence at baseline, and exposure to multiple ART regimens other than recommended by WHO. Out of 90 evaluated cases, 39(43%) were maintained on second-line ART. Forty-nine (54%) were ever switched to third-line ART. Twelve months virological suppression was 72% in the second-line and 93% in the third-line ART cohort, while retention in care was 80% and 94% respectively. Genotyping showed 62% resistance for PIs, and 52% triple class resistance to NRTIs, NNRTIs and PIs. Resistance was noted for the new class of integrase inhibitors, and for different drugs without any documented previous exposure to the same drug.Adopting WHO guidelines on switching ART regimens and provision of EAC can prevent unnecessary switching/exposure to third-line ART regimens. Genotyping is urgently required in national HIV programs, which currently use only the exposure history of patients for switching to third-line ART regimens."
https://openalex.org/W2991148153,"To establish a strategy for identifying protein-N-myristoylation-dependent phosphorylation of cellular proteins, Phos-tag SDS-PAGE was performed on wild-type (WT) and nonmyristoylated mutant (G2A-mutant) FMNL2 and FMNL3, phosphorylated N-myristoylated model proteins expressed in HEK293 cells. The difference in the banding pattern in Phos-tag SDS-PAGE between the WT and G2A-mutant FMNL2 indicated the presence of N-myristoylation-dependent phosphorylation sites in FMNL2. Phos-tag SDS-PAGE of FMNL2 mutants in which the putative phosphorylation sites listed in PhosphoSitePlus (an online database of phosphorylation sites) were changed to Ala revealed that Ser-171 and Ser-1072 are N-myristoylation-dependent phosphorylation sites in FMNL2. Similar experiments with FMNL3 demonstrated that N-myristoylation-dependent phosphorylation occurs at a single Ser residue at position 174, which is a Ser residue conserved between FMNL2 and FMNL3, corresponding to Ser-171 in FMNL2. The facts that phosphorylation of Ser-1072 in FMNL2 has been shown to play a critical role in integrin β1 internalization mediated by FMNL2 and that Ser-171 in FMNL2 and Ser-174 in FMNL3 are novel putative phosphorylation sites conserved between FMNL2 and FMNL3 indicate that the strategy used in this study is a useful tool for identifying and characterizing physiologically important phosphorylation reactions occurring on N-myristoylated proteins."

https://openalex.org/W2990630918,"Some floral visitors collect nectar by piercing flower external whorls, acting as nectar robbers. They leave robbery vestiges, which can cause changes in floral characteristics, including physical and chemical signals that may influence flower recognition by pollinators. If pollinating bees associate these changes with absence or reduction in nectar volume, they can avoid these flowers, negatively affecting pollination. We aimed to investigate the effect of robbery on primary and secondary attractants. Additionally, we experimentally investigated if the visual signs present in robbed flowers affect the bee pollination of this plant species by discouraging pollinator visits. This study was performed in a very common pollinator-plant-cheaters system comprised by a bee-pollinated Bignoniaceae species and a nectar-robber bee that lands on the corolla tube and makes slits at its base during the nectar robbery. We experimentally isolated the effect of nectar consumption by this nectar-robber and investigated if the slits caused by the nectar-robbers affected the floral scent emission. In addition, we experimentally evaluated the effect of visual signs (slits) associated to the nectar robbery and the effect of nectar depletion on the pollination of Jacaranda caroba (Bignoniaceae). The robbers visited around 75% of the flowers throughout the day and removed significant amounts of nectar from them. However, the damages the robbers cause did not affect floral scent emission and we did not verify significant differences on pollen deposition neither when comparing flowers with slits and control nor when comparing flowers with and without nectar. We showed that even though nectar-robbers visually honestly signal the robbery and deplete high amounts of nectar, they did not affect pollinator visitation. These results showed that presumably antagonistic interactions might in fact not be so."

https://openalex.org/W2991345299,"In Taiwan, Taroko National Park, famous for a precipitous marble gorge that cuts through it, is in a futile fight with gravity. The scars of at least a dozen landslides punctuate the view in all directions. Maintenance crews are perpetually spraying concrete on slopes in a last-ditch effort to stabilize them. The park gives out safety helmets for free, and strongly encourages visitors to wear them. All this moving rock and soil makes for a perfect laboratory for a team of researchers from the GFZ German Research Centre for Geosciences in Potsdam. For the past 3 years, they have scrambled and rappelled across the park, installing dozens of instruments in what will end up being Taiwan9s most comprehensive landscape dynamics observatory. One goal is to monitor landslides and understand their triggers. A bigger aim is to investigate their hidden impact on the climate: As massive chemical reactors, landslides draw carbon dioxide out of the sky and sometimes belch it out, too. Understanding their role as both carbon source and sink could help researchers better model the carbon cycle that ultimately controls our planet9s climate and habitability."
