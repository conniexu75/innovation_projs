https://openalex.org/W1544923801,"Microarray analysis has become a widely used tool for the generation of gene expression data on a genomic scale. Although many significant results have been derived from microarray studies, one limitation has been the lack of standards for presenting and exchanging such data. Here we present a proposal, the Minimum Information About a Microarray Experiment (MIAME), that describes the minimum information required to ensure that microarray data can be easily interpreted and that results derived from its analysis can be independently verified. The ultimate goal of this work is to establish a standard for recording and reporting microarray-based gene expression data, which will in turn facilitate the establishment of databases and public repositories and enable the development of data analysis tools. With respect to MIAME, we concentrate on defining the content and structure of the necessary information rather than the technical format for capturing it."

https://openalex.org/W2128171635,"Paraoxonase-1 (PON1) is a high density lipoprotein (HDL)-associated serum enzyme that protects low density lipoproteins from oxidative modifications. There is a relative lack of information on mechanisms implicated in PON1 release from cells. The present study focused on a model derived from stable transfection of CHO cells, to avoid co-secretion of apolipoprotein (apo) A-I and lipids, which could lead to formation of HDL-like complexes. Our results indicate that, in the absence of an appropriate acceptor, little PON1 is released. The results designate HDL as the predominant, physiological acceptor, whose efficiency is influenced by size and composition. Neither lipid-poor apoA-I or apoA-II nor low density lipoproteins could substitute for HDL. Protein-free phospholipid complexes promoted PON1 release. However, the presence of both apolipoprotein and phospholipid were necessary to promote release and stabilize the enzyme. Immunofluorescence studies demonstrated that PON1 was inserted into the external membrane of CHO cells, where it was enzymatically active. Accumulation of PON1 in the cell membrane was not influenced by the ability of the cell to co-secrete of apoA-I. Release appeared to involve desorption by HDL; human and reconstituted HDL promoted PON1 release in a saturable, high affinity manner (apparent affinity 1.59 ± 0.3 μg of HDL protein/ml). Studies with PON1-transfected hepatocytes (HuH-7) revealed comparable structural features with the peptide located in a punctate pattern at the external membrane and enzymatically active. We hypothesize that release of PON1 involves a docking process whereby HDL transiently associate with the cell membrane and remove the peptide from the external membrane. The secretory process may be of importance for assuring the correct lipoprotein destination of PON1 and thus its functional efficiency."

The CD28/CTLA4 ligands, CD80 (B7-1) and CD86 (B7-2), are expressed on the surface of freshly isolated splenic B cells, and their expression is up-regulated by lipopolysaccharides. In the present study, we have investigated whether signaling via CD80/CD86 could alter the proliferation and immunoglobulin synthesis of B cells. Splenic B cells were stimulated with lipopolysaccharides in the presence of anti-B7-1 (16-10A1) and anti-B7-2 (GL1) monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). Exciting features observed during the study were that cross-linking of CD86 with GL1 enhanced the proliferation and production of IgG1 and IgG2a isotypes. In contrast, anti-B7-1 (16-10A1) mAb could efficiently block the proliferation and production of IgG1 and IgG2a. Furthermore, GL1 mAb could also induce the secretion of IgG isotypes from B cell lymphomas. Importantly, 16-10A1 could retard the growth of lymphomas and favored the up-regulation of pro-apoptotic molecules caspase-3, caspase-8, Fas, FasL, Bak, and Bax and down-regulation of anti-apoptotic molecule Bcl-x(L). In contrast, GL1 augmented the level of anti-apoptotic molecules Bcl-w and Bcl-x(L) and decreased the levels of pro-apoptotic molecule caspase-8, thereby providing a novel insight into the mechanism whereby triggering through CD80 and CD86 could deliver regulatory signals. Thus, this study is the first demonstration of a distinct signaling event induced by CD80 and CD86 molecules in B cell lymphoma. Finally, the significance of the finding is that CD80 provided negative signal for the proliferation and IgG secretion of normal B cells and B cell lymphomas. In contrast, CD86 encouraged the activity of B cells. To date, not much has been known regarding the role of CD80 and CD86 molecules in signaling of B cells.

Contact between B and T cells can be mediated by antigen presentation, as well as antigen-independent cell interaction by molecules known as adhesion (LFA-1, LFA-3, ICAM-1, etc.) and costimulatory molecules (CD80, CD86, CD40, etc.) (3Damle N.K.

Signals from T cells induce two opposite fates in B cells: clonal expansion of B cells that bind specifically to foreign antigens and clonal deletion of equivalent B cells that bind self-antigen. The role of costimulatory molecules is very well established in the activation of T cells (3Damle N.K. Klussman K. Linsley P.S. Aruffo A. J. Immunol. 1992; 148: 1985-1992PubMed Google Scholar), but nothing has been determined definitively about how these molecules operate in the activation and differentiation of B cells (8Hirokawa M.

Millsum M.J. Guy G.R. Ledbetter J.A. J. Immunol. 1988; 140: 1425-1430PubMed Google Scholar, 12Goldstein M.D. Watts T.H. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 2837-2843PubMed Google Scholar, 13Nakajima A. Kodama T.

Haematol. 1997; 97: 652-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Both of these play a major role in providing costimulation to T cells, leading to their proliferation, cytokine production, and development of effector functions. CD80 and CD86 could also serve as counter-receptors that transduce distinct signal to the antigen-presenting cells upon engagement by CD28 or CTLA-4. The intracellular domains of CD80 and CD86 are quite distinct and could mediate differential signal transduction. Such signaling could alter the B cells' ability to function as effector cells. The ability of the B cells to deliver the costimulatory signal to T cells by B7 molecules is very well established (15Shahinian A. Pfeffer K. Lee K.P. Kundig T.M. Kishihara K. Wakeham Kawai A.K.

In contrast, whether the engagement of CD80 and CD86 molecules by CD28 and CTLA-4 affect the function of the B cells is very poorly documented (9Freeman G.J. Boussiotis V.A. Anumanthan A. Bernstein G.M. Ke X.Y. Rennet P.D. Gray G.S. Gribben J.G. Nadler L.M. Immunity. 1995; 2: 523-532Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar,10Sethna M.P. Van Parijs L. Sharpe A.H. Abbas A.K. Freeman G.J. Immunity. 1994; 1: 415-421Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Moreover, nothing is known precisely in the case of B cell proliferation and differentiation by the engagement of CD80 and CD86 molecules. However, there is indirect evidence reported earlier that CD28-CTLA4/B7-signaling pathways may affect B cell responses and the regulation of immunoglobulin (Ig) synthesis (18Ikemizu S. Gilbert R.J. Fennelly J.A. Collins A.V. Harlos K. Jones E.Y. Stuart D.I. Davis S.J. Immunity. 2000; 12: 51-60Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 19Bajorath J. Peach R.J.

Torres R. Howard M. Cell. Immunol. 1993; 152: 468-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). To compare the regulatory role of CD80 (B7-1) and CD86 (B7-2) molecules in humoral immune responses, B7-1−/− and B7-2−/− mice were generated and profound deficits in both antigen-specific IgG1 (Th2-dependent) and IgG2a (Th1-dependent) responses demonstrated that B7 costimulation can influence IgG production in vivo (21Borriello F. Sethna M.P. Boyd S.D. Schweitzer A.N. Tivol E.A. Jacoby D. Strom T.B. Simpson E.M. Freeman G.J. Sharpe A.H. Immunity. 1997; 6: 303-313Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). However, the basis of this abnormal Ig production was contributed to the absence of Th1- or Th2-specific cytokines in B7-1/2−/− mice that regulate the IgG1 and IgG2a production. Thus, the aim of our study was to evaluate for the first time the role of CD80- and CD86-mediated signal transduction in the costimulation of B cells. The results show that triggering through CD80 specifically inhibits the proliferation and IgG secretion by LPS1-stimulated B cells. By contrast, CD86 chiefly augments the B cell activity. Further, the growth of B cell lymphomas could also be retarded by CD80 cross-linking. Signaling through CD80 inhibited the growth of the B cell lymphoma by up-regulating the expression of pro-apoptotic molecules caspase-3, caspase-8, Fas, FasL, Bak, and Bax and down-regulating the levels of anti-apoptotic molecule Bcl-x(L). In contrast, triggering through CD86 augmented the level of anti-apoptotic molecules Bcl-w and Bcl-x(L) and decreased the levels of caspase-8. Thus, the signals delivered by anti-B7-1 and -B7-2 antibodies can differentially regulate the activity of B cell and its lymphoma. Female inbred BALB/c mice (8–10 weeks old) were obtained from the National Institute of Immunology (New Delhi, India). Fetal calf serum was purchased from Sera-Lab (Crawley Down, United Kingdom), RPMI 1640 was from Invitrogen,l-glutamine and streptomycin were from Serva (Heidelberg, Germany), and recombinant IL-4 and IFN-γ were the products of Genzyme (Boston, MA). LPS (from Salmonella typhosa), mIgG1, mIgG2a, and rabbit anti-rat FITC-labeled Ab were procured from Sigma and goat anti-rat IgG F(ab)2 from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories (West Grove, PA). Anti-B7-1, CD40, Fas-FITC, FasL-biotin mAbs were purchased from PharMingen (San Diego, CA) and anti-B7-2 Ab was a gift from Dr. Vijay Kuchroo (Boston, MA). Rabbit anti-caspase-3 (CPP32) antibody was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnologies. The RPA kit was purchased from PharMingen. Enhanced chemiluminescence kit (ECL) was a product of Amersham Biosciences, Inc., and polyvinylidene difluoride membrane was from Bio-Rad. The cell lines and hybridomas used in this study,i.e. CRL 1704, TIB 208, HB 188, and HB 170, were procured from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC; Rockville, MD). Cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% FCS, l-glutamine (2 mm), penicillin (50 μg/ml), streptomycin (50 μg/ml), and 2-mercaptoethanol (0.05 mm). B cells were prepared as reported previously (2Agrewala J.N. Susmit S. Verma R.K. Mishra G.C. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 1067-1077PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, a single cell suspension of BALB/c mice spleens was prepared in balanced salt solution. The red blood cells were depleted by treatment with hemolytic Gey's solution. The adherent cells were removed by plating on the plastic Petri plates (Nunc, Roskilde, Denmark) for 2 h at 37 °C and 7% CO2. Nonadherent cells were incubated in nylon wool column for 1 h at 37 °C in 7% CO2. The adherent cells eluted from the column were treated sequentially on ice for 45 min each with a mixture of anti-Mac2 and anti-Mac3 Abs and a mixture containing anti-Thy1, L3T4, and CD8 Abs, followed by complement-mediated killing. The purity of cells stained with anti-IgM Ab was over 95%, as analyzed by FACS (Becton Dickinson, Mountain View, CA). FACS analysis was done as mentioned previously (2Agrewala J.N. Susmit S. Verma R.K. Mishra G.C. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 1067-1077PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 1,000,000 B cells (stimulated with 20 μg/ml LPS for 48 h) and WEHI-279 cells were incubated with the anti-B7-1, anti-B7-2, and CD40 Abs (1.0 μg) diluted in 100 μl of PBS plus 2% BSA for 1 h at 4 °C. The cells were then washed three times with PBS plus 2% BSA. Anti-rat FITC (1:135 dilution) was then added and the cells were further incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. The cells were washed five times with PBS and fixed in 1% paraformaldehyde and analyzed by FACS for the expression of B7-1 and B7-2 molecules. As a control for anti-B7-1 and anti-B7-2 Abs, the cells were also incubated with RtIg. The cells from each suspension were acquired on CellQuest software for FACScan (Becton Dickinson). Debris in the cell suspension was excluded from the analysis by suitable gating that allowed the collection of data only from those light-scattering events (i.e. cells) of a size consistent with B cells. The analysis for the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) was done on histograms, where abscissa and ordinate denote log FITC fluorescence and relative cell count, respectively. B cells activated with 20 μg/ml lipopolysaccharide (5 × 103 to 1 × 105 cells/well) were incubated with anti-B7-1 and -B7-2 mAbs at a concentration of 0.01–1.0 μg/ml in a total volume of 200 μl of RPMI, 10% FCS at different (24–96 h) time intervals. The LPS-activated B cells (1 × 105/well) were also cultured with optimum dose of IFN-γ (10 units/ml) and IL-4 (100 units/ml) in the presence of different concentration of anti-B7 mAbs. The suitable controls containing B cells, LPS-activated B cells incubated with control RtIg, or B cells without antibodies were also kept. The cells were incubated at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 7% CO2. After the specified time period, the cultures were pulsed with 0.5 μCi of [3H]thymidine/well. After 16 h, the plates were harvested and incorporation of thymidine was determined by using an automatic cell harvester (Skatron, Tranby, Norway) and liquid scintillation counting. The cultures were set as mentioned in B cell proliferation assays. The SNs were collected on day 6 from the experimental as well as control wells and were analyzed for IgG1 and IgG2a by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (2Agrewala J.N. Susmit S. Verma R.K. Mishra G.C. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 1067-1077PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, triplicate wells were coated overnight at 4 °C with 5 μg/ml goat anti-mouse IgG1 and IgG2a Abs in carbonate-bicarbonate buffer, pH 9.6. The unbound sites were blocked with 2% BSA, and then log 6 dilutions of culture SNs were added for 2 h at 37 °C. The plates were then incubated with rabbit anti-mouse IgG horseradish peroxidase-labeled antibody at 37 °C for 2 h. The usual steps of washings with PBS-Tween 20 were carried at each step. The color developed because of the substrate OPD was visualized at 492 nm. The concentration of Abs is represented as nanograms/ml, as computed by using standard mouse IgG1 and IgG2a isotypes. The B cells (5 × 10 5/ml) stimulated with LPS (20 μg/ml) were cultured with anti-B7-1 and -B7-2 mAbs (1.0 μg/ml) for 72 h. Four hours before harvesting the cells, brefeldin A (10 μg/ml) was added. The cells were harvested and resuspended in PBS containing brefeldin A and fixed by adding equal volume of 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min. The cells were incubated for 10 min in PBS/BSA/saponin to permeabilize the cells. The cells were blocked with 0.5% rabbit sera and saponin and stained immediately for intracellular expression of IgG1 and IgG2a using a modified method described by Murphy et al. (22Murphy E. Shibuya K. Hosken N. Openshaw P. Maino V. Davis K. Murphy K. Garra A.O. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 901-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). The cells were incubated with anti-IgG1-biotin and anti-IgG2a-biotin (2 μg/ml) for 30 min and then with avidin-FITC (1:1000 dilution). The usual steps of washings were followed at each step using 1% BSA and 0.5% saponin. The last washing was done in PBS/BSA without saponin to allow membrane closure. The samples were analyzed by FACScan flow aptometer (Becton Dickinson). Results were analyzed by CellQuest software. Different concentrations of WEHI-279 cells (5 × 102 to 5 × 103/well) were cultured with anti-B7-1, B7-2, and CD40 mAbs (0.01–1.0 μg/ml) in a total volume of 200 μl of RPMI, 10% FCS. The suitable controls containing WEHI-279 cells cultured in the presence or absence of LPS, control RtIg, or without antibodies were also kept. The cells were incubated for 72 h, pulsed with 0.5 μCi of [3H]thymidine for another 4 h, and then processed for β-scintillation counting. Similar types of cultures were also kept for 4–5 days, and SNs were harvested and analyzed for IgG1 and IgG2a secretion as mentioned above. B cells (LPS-stimulated) and WEHI-279 cells were cultured for 48 h with 1.0 μg/ml anti-B7-1, B7-2, and CD40 Abs and control RtIg in 200 μl of RPMI 1640 and 10% FCS. The cells were washed and labeled with anti-Fas-FITC and anti-FasL-biotin/avidin-FITC. As mentioned above, the expression was demonstrated by FACScan. Apoptosis was detected by utilizing the method developed by Nicoletti (23Nicoletti I. Migliorati G. Pagliacci M.C. Grignani F. Riccardi C.J. J. Immunol. Methods. 1991; 139: 271-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (4415) Google Scholar). Briefly, B cells and WEHI-279 cells were stimulated with anti-B7-1 and -B7-2 Abs (1.0 μg/ml) for 48 h. The cells were further incubated with anti-Fas Ab (1.0 μg/ml) for a period of 14 h. The cells harvested from the cultures were centrifuged; the cell pellet was fixed in 0.5 ml of cold 70% ethanol at 4 °C for 1 h. The cells were centrifuged again and resuspended in 0.5 ml of RNase (1.0 mg/ml) and incubated at room temperature for 20 min. Finally, 30 μl of propidium iodide (0.1 mg/ml) was added into each sample and incubated for another 10 min in the dark at room temperature before cell cycle was analyzed by flow cytometry. Apoptosis in the cells was analyzed by a FACScan with cytomation, data acquisition, and software (lysis II) for red fluorescence. Initial identification of the cells was made with the help of FSC/SSC plots. The apoptotic cells were selected on the basis of the expression of higher SSC because of the condensation of the nuclear chromatin. The debris was excluded on the basis of its very low SSC and FSC signals, and normal cells were gated and analyzed. The WEHI-279 cells were cultured with anti-CD80 Ab, anti-CD86 Ab, and RtIg Ab and cross-linked with anti-RtIg Ab as mentioned for the proliferation assay. Total RNA was extracted from WEHI-279 cells by the guanidinium isothiocyanate-phenol-chloroform method using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen). The expression was determined using the RiboQuant multiprobe RNase protection assay system (PharMingen) following the manufacturer's instruction (24PharMingen (1998) PharMingen Instruction Manual: Apoptosis, Applied Reagents and Technologies, 2nd Ed., pp. 77–89, San DiegoGoogle Scholar). Briefly, 5 μg of total RNA was hybridized to 32P-labeled RNA probes overnight at 56 °C, followed by treatment with RNase for 45 min at 30 °C. In each set we have included L32 (which encodes a ribosomal protein) and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase genes to serve as housekeeping gene controls. The samples were submitted to electrophoresis through a 8 m urea, 5% polyacrylamide gel. The probe lengths are greater than the “protected” fragment lengths; this is because of the presence of flanking sequences. The resulting resolved bands were imaged using a phosphorimager (Bio-Rad Molecular Imager FX). The normalized quantity for each band was obtained by dividing with L32 housekeeping gene control. The -fold activation (increase or decrease) was calculated by dividing the value of normalized quantity of the experimental samples with that of WEHI-279 cells cultured with medium alone. WEHI-279 cells were incubated with anti-B7-1 Ab or RtIg and cross-linked with anti-RtIg as mentioned for the proliferation assay. The experiment was done as mentioned previously (25Sah N.K. Taneja T.K. Pathak N. Begum R. Athar M. Hasnain S.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4838-4843Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 26Hasnain S.E. Taneja T.K. Sah N.K. Mohan M. Pathak N. Sahdev S. Athar M. Begum R. J. Biosci. 1999; 24: 101-107Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Briefly, after incubation, cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and re-suspended in lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 0.32 m sucrose, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1.0 μg/ml aprotinin, 1.0 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8) for 5 min at 4 °C followed by protein determination with BCA method (Pierce). The protein (50 μg) was resolved on 12% polyacrylamide gel and was assayed by Western blotting using anti-caspase-3 Ab. The expression levels were analyzed using NIH Image software. The FACScan revealed the presence of CD80 (MFI of 106.49) and CD86 (MFI of 155.80) molecules on B cells incubated with LPS for 48 h (Fig. 1 a). We also evaluated the expression of CD80, CD86, and CD40 molecules on the B cell lymphoma, WEHI-279. WEHI-279 expressed CD80 (MFI of 190.09), CD86 (MFI of 111.51), and CD40 (MFI of 125.73) molecules (Fig. 1 b). The RtIg used as control for anti-B7-1 and -B7-2 mAbs failed to show any significant shift in MFI. We next determined whether triggering of CD80 and CD86 molecules by their respective mAbs will affect the proliferation and differentiation of LPS-activated B cells. The experiments were performed with different concentrations of responder cells and readout at different time points after stimulation. Surprisingly, cross-linking of CD80 with anti-B7-1 mAb (16-10A1) significantly inhibited the proliferation of different doses (5 × 103 to 1 × 105 cells/well) of LPS stimulated B cells from as early as 24 h of the cultures. The maximum decline (61.56%) in the proliferation was observed when the B cells were cultured at the concentration of 5 × 104 with 16-10A1 (1.0 μg/ml) for 48 h (Fig. 2 A). It is worth to mention here that 16-10A1 was found to be highly potent for a range of 5 × 103 to 1 × 105 cells at a concentration of 1.0 μg/ml in significantly down-regulating the proliferation of B cells at any time period (24–96 h) of the study. The response was observed in a dose-dependent manner. Unlike anti-B7-1 mAb, signaling by anti-B7-2 mAb (GL1) significantly enhanced the proliferation of LPS stimulated B cells (Fig.2 B). There was gradual increase in the proliferation of B cells, irrespective of cell concentration (5 × 103, 1 × 104, 5 × 104, and 1 × 105/well). The maximum and significantly high proliferation (97.86%) was observed when 1 × 105 cells/well were cultured with GL1 (1.0 μg/ml) for 48 h. In contrast, only 20.70% enhancement in the growth of B cells was observed when the B cells were cultured for 96 h. On account of overproliferation and the death of the cells, the magnitude of proliferation declined by the end of 96 h. No spectacular difference in the activity of LPS-activated B cell was noticed in the control cultures incubated with RtIg. B cells incubated with medium and anti-B7-1 and -B7-2 mAbs did not register any proliferation. We also evaluated the impact of signaling through CD80 and CD86 on the secretion of IgG1 and IgG2a isotypes. We have chosen to measure IgG1 and IgG2a isotypes because of their production precisely by IL-4 and IFN-γ, respectively (17Snapper C.M. Paul W.E. Science. 1987; 236: 944-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (1621) Google Scholar). Interestingly, anti-B7-1 mAb down-regulated the production of both IgG1 and IgG2a (Fig. 3 A). The concentration measured of IgG1 Ab was 114 ng/ml, and that of IgG2a was 258 ng/ml, when the B cells were cultured with LPS. There was significant decline in IgG1 from 114 to 44 ng/ml and in IgG2a from 258 to 44 ng/ml, when anti-B7-1 Ab was added into the cultures (Fig.3 A). More interestingly, anti-B7-2 Ab critically increased the production of IgG1 (from 116 to 1750 ng/ml) and IgG2a (from 260 to 1944 ng/ml) isotypes, when cocultured with LPS-stimulated B cells (Fig.3 B). The inhibitory signals delivered by anti-B7-1 mAb (1.0 μg/ml) were powerful enough to down-regulate the secretion of IgG1 and IgG2a induced by IL-4 (IgG1; from 610 to 518 ng/ml) and IFN-γ (IgG2a; from 708 to 258 ng/ml), respectively (Fig. 3 A). However, in the case of anti-B7-2 Ab (1.0 mg/ml) stimulation, IL-4 (100 units/ml) and IFN-γ (10 units/ml) worked in a synergistic fashion with the Ab and augmented the yield of IgG1 (from 610 to 2188 ng/ml) and IgG2a (from 710 to 2482 ng/ml), respectively (Fig. 3 B). Anti-IL-4 and IFN-γ Abs could not block the production of IgG1 and IgG2a isotypes, respectively, induced by anti-B7-2 mAb (data not shown). The mAbs worked in a dose-dependent manner, and the maximum activity was attained at a concentration of 1.0 μg/ml. The control RtIg used in the cultures could not influence any change in B cell activity. We also observed the distinct effect on the intracellular expression of IgG1 and IgG2a isotypes upon cross-linking CD80 and CD86 molecules with their respective mAbs. Similar results were seen as observed in the case of IgG secretion. Anti-B7-1 mAb diminished, whereas anti-B7-2 mAb enhanced, the intracellular exhibition of IgG1 and IgG2a-isotypes (Fig. 4). It was of concern for us whether the decrease in the proliferation in B cells is a direct result of the death of the cells induced by anti-B7-1 mAb stimulus or the inhibition in the DNA synthesis. Therefore, we co-cultured LPS-stimulated B cells with anti-B7-1 mAb and then monitored the viability of cells by propidium iodide staining. It was ascertained that anti-B7-1 mAb signaling did not alter the viability of the cells (Fig. 5). No change in the expression of Fas and FasL was also observed on B cells (data not shown). Because the CD40 molecule has differential effect on normal B cells and B cell lymphomas (27Funakoshi S. Longo D.L. Beckwith M. Conley D.K. Tsarfary G. Tsarfaty L. Armitage R.J. Fanslow W.C. Spriggs M.K. Murphy W.J. Blood. 1994; 83: 2787-2794Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we evaluated the signaling capacity of CD80, CD86, and CD40 molecules in the proliferation of WEHI-279 B cell lymphoma (Fig. 6). Interestingly, anti-B7-1 and CD40 mAbs but not anti-B7-2 mAb could significantly down-regulate the growth of WEHI-279 cells. The dose of 1.0 μg/ml anti-B7-1 mAb was highly potent in inhibiting the proliferation of 500 and 5000 cells up to 43 and 29%, respectively (Fig. 6, Aand B). Similarly, the extent of anti-CD40 mAb mediated inhibition was comparable with the effect induced by anti-B7-1 mAb. It has also been reported previously that anti-CD40 mAb renders WEHI-279 cells sensitive for Fas-mediated killing (14Bergamo A. Bataille R. Pellat-Deceunynck C. Br. J. Haematol. 1997; 97: 652-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). However, for the first time we have demonstrated that anti-CD40 and anti-B7-1 mAbs show synergistic effect. Both the Abs, when added into the cultures, inhibited the proliferation of WEHI-279 by 83 and 48% for the two doses of the cells used in the experiments, respectively (Fig. 6,A and B). The control cultures containing RtIg did not induce any significant change in the growth of the cells. Because anti-B7-1 and -B7-2 mAbs could regulate the proliferative response in B cells and WEHI-279 lymphoma and the differentiation events in B cells, we were therefore curious to know whether these antibodies could exert any impact on the secretion of IgG1 and IgG2a by WEHI-279 cells. Accordingly, we monitored the secretion of IgG1 and IgG2a isotypes, in the cultures of WEHI-279, stimulated with antibodies to CD80 (B7-1), CD86 (B7-2), and CD40 molecules. WEHI-279 cells cultured with medium alone or with LPS failed to show detectable level of IgG-isotypes. Most surprisingly, anti-B7-2 mAb could significantly induce WEHI-279 cells to secrete IgG1 and IgG2a (Fig. 7). However, anti-B7-1 and CD40 mAbs completely failed to stimulate WEHI-279 cells to produce IgG isotypes. Similar effects were also observed in the case of A20 lymphoma (data not shown). The control cultures comprising WEHI-279 cells and RtIg could not induce any change. Because anti-B7-1 and CD40 mAbs exerted decline in the growth of WEHI-279, it became essential for us to monitor the cause of this response. We therefore did flow cytometry to explore the possibility of the expression of Fas and FasL on WEHI-279 cells incubated with anti-B7-1, B7-2, and CD40 Abs (Fig. 8). Importantly, anti-B7-1 and CD40 mAbs but not anti-B7-2 mAb could successfully augment the expression of Fas and FasL on WEHI-279 cells (Fig. 8, a and b). The control cultures involving RtIg did not display any change in Fas and FasL expression. We finally analyzed the functional activity of Fas and FasL induced"

Proteolytic digestion of tissues has been utilized to release microfibrils for study. Few of the molecules that connect microfibrils to other elements in the matrix have been identified. In this study, electron microscopic immunolocalization of anti-versican antibodies in tissues and in extracted microfibrils demonstrated that the C-terminal region of versican is found associated with fibrillin microfibrils. Extraction of microfibrils followed by treatment of microfibrils under dissociating conditions suggested that the versican C terminus is covalently bound to microfibrils. Binding assays using recombinant fibrillin-1 polypeptides and recombinant lectican lectin domains indicated that the versican lectin domain binds to specific fibrillin-1 polypeptides. The versican lectin domain also bound to molecules comigrating with authentic fibrillin-1 monomers in an assay using cell culture medium. In assays using microfibrils, the versican lectin domain demonstrated preferential binding compared with other lecticans. Binding was calcium-dependent. The binding site for versican in microfibrils is most likely within a region of fibrillin-1 between calcium-binding epidermal growth factor-like domains 11 and 21. Human mutations in this region can result in severe forms of the Marfan syndrome (“neonatal” Marfan syndrome).

Keene D.R. Engvall E. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 2499-2509Crossref PubMed Scopus (909) Google Scholar). Microfibrils are present in tissues both as independent ultrastructural entities and as components of elastic fibers. Polymers of fibrillin-1 and fibrillin-2 are thought to constitute the basic structure of microfibrils (2Sakai L.Y. Keene D.R. Glanville R.W. Bächinger H.P. J. Biol.

Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 817-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar), have been immunolocalized to elastic fibers. However, the relationship of each of these molecules to fibrillin, to elastin, or to each other is not well understood. It is not known which molecules contribute (along with fibrillin) to the basic structure of microfibrils, which ones bridge components of elastic fibers, and which ones help to stabilize interactions between microfibrils/elastic fibers and the surrounding ECM. High affinity binding (Kd = 56 nm) between fibrillin-1 and fibulin-2 has been demonstrated (11Reinhardt D.P. Sasaki T. Dzamba B.J. Keene D.R. Chu M.L. Göhring W. Timpl R. Sakai L.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19489-19496Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). However, tissue distribution studies have shown that fibulin-2 is located on some microfibrils, but not all, suggesting that the function of fibulin-2 may be to connect fibrillin-1 to elastic fiber components in a tissue-specific manner (11Reinhardt D.P. Sasaki T. Dzamba B.J. Keene D.R. Chu M.L. Göhring W. Timpl R. Sakai L.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19489-19496Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Indeed, fibulin-2 was shown to bind to tropoelastin with high affinity (18Sasaki T. Gohring W. Miosge N. Abrams W.R. Rosenbloom J. Timpl R. FEBS Lett. 1999; 460: 280-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). In contrast to fibulin-2, versican displays a ubiquitous distribution in connective tissues. In skin, the staining pattern of versican is similar to that of the elastic fiber network, composed of mature elastic fibers running parallel to the epidermis and extending upwards as elaunin and oxytalan fibrils toward the dermal-epidermal junction (17Zimmermann D.R. Dours-Zimmermann M. Schubert M. Bruckner-Tuderman L. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 817-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). In other tissues as well, immunostaining of versican resembles elastic fiber stains (19Bode-Lesniewska B. Dours-Zimmermann M.T. Odermatt B.F. Briner J. Heitz P.U. Zimmermann D.R. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1996; 44: 303-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Versican, also called PG-M, was originally characterized as a large chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan expressed in prechondrogenic mesenchymal condensations in developing chick limb buds (20Kimata K.

Solursh M. Anat. Embryol. 1990; 181: 227-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). In the ECM of certain malignant tumors, versican is also characteristically expressed (22Isogai Z. Shinomura T. Yamakawa N. Takeuchi J. Tsuji T. Heinegård D. Kimata K. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 3902-3908PubMed Google Scholar, 23Nara Y. Kato Y. Torii Y. Tsuji Y. Nakagaki S. Goto S. Isobe H. Nakashima N. Takeuchi J. Histochem. J. 1997; 29: 21-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) as a component of a hyaluronan-rich matrix. In denser connective tissues such as the dermis and aorta, versican is deposited with aging (24Bernstein E.F. Fisher L.W. Li K. LeBaron R.G. Tan E.M. Uitto J. Lab. Invest. 1995; 72: 662-669PubMed Google Scholar, 25Matsuura R. Isaka N. Imanaka-Yoshida K. Yoshida T. Sakakura T. Nakano T. J. Pathol. 1996; 180: 311-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Based on sequence alignments, versican is a member of the lectican family of proteoglycans (26Ruoslahti E. Glycobiology. 1996; 6: 489-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar), which includes versican (27Zimmermann D.R. Ruoslahti E.

Chem. 1991; 266: 894-902Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), neurocan (30Rauch U. Karthikeyan L. Maurel P. Margolis R.U. Margolis R.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19536-19547Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and brevican (31Yamada H. Watanabe K. Shimonaka M. Yamaguchi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10119-10126Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These proteoglycans have common features such as a hyaluronan-binding domain at the N terminus and epidermal growth factor (EGF)1-like, C-type lectin-like, and complement regulatory protein-like domains at the C terminus. They are highly similar in primary structure, with 40–60% identical amino acid residues. However, the tissue distributions and proposed functions are distinctive among these family members. In contrast to the ubiquitous tissue distribution of versican, aggrecan is expressed only in cartilage, whereas neurocan and brevican are specific to brain. The investigations presented here were undertaken to determine whether versican can be found associated with specific ultrastructural elements and whether versican interacts with fibrillin-1. Results were obtained that provide new insights into the structure of fibrillin microfibrils and how matrix molecules interact to anchor fibrous elements into the amorphous ground substance. Mouse monoclonal antibody (mAb) 2B1, raised against the large proteoglycan isolated from a yolk sac tumor, was obtained from Seikagaku Corp. (Tokyo, Japan) (32Sobue M. Nakashima N. Fukatsu T.

This antibody has been shown to recognize all splicing variants of human PG-M/versican (22Isogai Z. Shinomura T. Yamakawa N. Takeuchi J. Tsuji T. Heinegård D. Kimata K. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 3902-3908PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, the epitope for mAb 2B1 has been located within the C-terminal half of versican (V3) (33Zako M. Shinomura T. Ujita M. Ito K. Kimata K.

Wiedemann H. Matzner M. Chu M.L. Timpl R. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 2895-2904Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Microfibrils were extracted from human fetal membranes. Fetal membranes obtained from 13 normal placentas were minced in a Polytron homogenizer and extensively washed with water (by repeated centrifugation, followed by resuspension of the pellet) and with 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 1 mNaCl. All procedures were performed with precooled solutions at 4 °C. The pellet was finally suspended in 1 liter of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 10 mmCaCl2, 2 mmN-ethylmaleimide, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Then, 120 ml of the suspension was digested with 0.11 mg/ml highly purified collagenase (Worthington) in the presence of diisopropyl fluorophosphate (1 μl/ml; Sigma) at room temperature for 24 h and centrifuged at 38,000 × g for 30 min. The pellet was resuspended in 30 ml of the buffer described above, further digested with crude collagenase (0.66 mg/ml; type 1A, Sigma) in the presence of diisopropyl fluorophosphate (1 μl/ml) at room temperature for 24 h, and then centrifuged twice at 38,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatant was digested with 0.5 mg/ml DNase I (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) at room temperature for 3 h. 20-ml aliquots were fractionated on a Sepharose CL-2B molecular sieve column (total volume of 270 ml; Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) equilibrated in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 10 mmCaCl2 at a flow rate of 0.3 ml/min. The fractions were collected every 3.6 ml (12 min/tube). The fractions that eluted in the void volume (see Fig. 2A,bar) were analyzed by electron microscopy after rotary shadowing. SDS-PAGE (5% acrylamide) of the void volume fractions was performed using 10 μg of total protein/well under nonreducing conditions, after samples were treated with or without chondroitinase ABC (36Oike Y. Kimata K. Shinomura T. Suzuki S. Biochem. J. 1980; 191: 203-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Dot blot analysis was performed using a nitrocellulose filter spotted with 2.5 μl from every other fraction. The blot was blocked with 5% nonfat milk in Tris-buffered saline (TBS) for 1 h and then incubated with mAb 2B1 (diluted 1:3000) or mAb 69 or 26 (each diluted 1:400) in TBS. After washing with 0.05% Tween 20 in TBS, the blots were incubated with peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Sigma). The blots were developed with chemiluminescent substrate (SuperSignal, Pierce) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. To determine whether aggregates containing hyaluronan and versican were coeluting with fibrillin microfibrils, microfibril fractions (see Fig.2A, bar) were pooled, dialyzed against 20 mm sodium acetate (pH 5.8) containing 0.15 mNaCl, and then digested with 8.45 units/ml hyaluronidase (fromStreptomyces hyalurolyticus; Sigma) at room temperature for 24 h. The microfibril sample was rechromatographed on Sepharose CL-2B, and fractions were analyzed by dot blotting with mAb 2B1 and anti-fibrillin antibodies. In addition, the supernatant from the tissues (extracted with crude collagenase and digested with DNase I) was dialyzed against 20 mm sodium acetate (pH 5.8) containing 0.15 m NaCl, treated with 8.45 units/ml hyaluronidase at room temperature for 24 h, and applied to the Sepharose CL-2B column. Fractions were analyzed by dot blotting. In addition, fractions containing microfibrils (see Fig. 2A,bar) were pooled and dialyzed against 4 mguanidine HCl and 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) using a membrane cutoff of Mr 10,000. Then, 10 ml of the dialyzed sample was concentrated using a Centriplus filtration unit (membrane cutoff of Mr 10,000; Amicon, Inc.) to 6 ml and subjected to molecular sieve chromatography under dissociating conditions. A Sepharose CL-2B column (total volume of 90 ml) was equilibrated in 4 m guanidine HCl and 50 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.5), and the sample was applied at a flow rate of 0.1 ml/min. Protein concentrations were determined using a BCA protein assay kit (Pierce) with bovine serum albumin as the standard. Dot blot analysis was performed as described above. Samples containing microfibrils were dialyzed against H2O and rotary-shadowed as described previously (37Morris N.P. Keene D.R. Glanville R.W. Bentz H. Burgeson R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 5638-5644Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Microfibrils obtained after sieve chromatography (see Fig. 2, A and B) were used. Microfibrils were incubated with mAb 2B1 and then further incubated with secondary antibody (goat anti-mouse IgG conjugated to 5-nm gold particles). After incubation, the samples were deposited onto carbon-coated 600-mesh grids and contrasted with 2% (w/v) phosphotungstic acid (pH 7.0). Controls included samples in which the primary antibody was omitted or in which primary antibodies of alternate specificity were used.

The tissue was rinsed in phosphate-buffered saline and then submerged overnight with mAb 2B1 diluted 1:5 in phosphate-buffered saline. Following an extensive rinse in phosphate-buffered saline, the tissue was submerged overnight with 5-nm colloidal gold-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.), rinsed extensively in phosphate-buffered saline and 0.1 m cacodylate buffer, fixed, dehydrated, and embedded in Spurrs epoxy. 90-nm-thick sections, which included reticular dermis, were stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate and examined with a Philips EM410 transmission electron microscope.

These polypeptides have been characterized by sequence analysis, calcium binding, reactivity to monoclonal antibodies, rotary shadowing electron microscopy, hydrodynamic methods, and CD spectroscopy. By all analytical tests employed, these recombinant polypeptides appear to be properly folded. The production of recombinant lectin domains of lecticans has been reported (42Aspberg A. Binkert C.

Mörgelin M. Sasaki T. Timpl R. Heinegård D. Aspberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1253-1261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). To produce the fusion proteins, a secreted alkaline phosphatase module was inserted in frame C-terminal to the lectin domains, followed by a hexahistidine tag. Affinity measurements between lectin-like domains of proteoglycans and fibrillin-1 polypeptides were obtained using surface plasmon resonance. Purified recombinant lectin-like domains were diluted in 10 mm sodium acetate (pH 4.0) and coupled to a BIAcore CM5 sensor chip, resulting in immobilization levels of 1700–2000 response units. Recombinant fibrillin-1 polypeptides (1.9–31.25 nm) were flowed over the lectin surface and a blank surface at 35 μl/min. The running buffer was 10 mm HEPES, 2 mm CaCl2, and 0.005% surfactant P20. The surface was regenerated by injection of 20 mm EDTA in the running buffer after each cycle. After subtraction of the blank surface curves, the association and dissociation rate constants for each lectin/peptide combination were determined using a simultaneous global curve fit to the response traces (BIAevaluation Version 3.0). Mass transfer limitations were apparent neither in the derivative of association curves nor in control experiments with injections of a constant concentration of analyte at different flow rates. Blot overlay assays were performed as described previously (11Reinhardt D.P. Sasaki T. Dzamba B.J. Keene D.R. Chu M.L. Göhring W. Timpl R. Sakai L.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19489-19496Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) using serum-free conditioned medium from human cell cultures. Normal dermal fibroblasts were obtained from explant cultures of neonatal foreskin. A204 rhabdomyosarcoma cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection. Cells were grown to confluency in T-75 flasks and incubated for 24 h in 7 ml of serum-free medium. Media samples were harvested, and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride was added to 2 mm. The dermal fibroblast cell layer was scraped up and extracted in 7 ml of TBS, 10 mm EDTA, and 2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. 1 ml of conditioned medium or cell layer was precipitated by trichloroacetic acid, resolved under nonreducing conditions on 4.5% SDS-PAGE, and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. Recombinant versican lectin domain-alkaline phosphatase fusion proteins (1 μg/ml) in TBS containing 5 mmCaCl2 were incubated with the blots at 4 °C overnight. After washing three times with 0.05% Tween 20 in TBS, color development was achieved using alkaline phosphatase substrate (1-Step nitro blue tetrazolium/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate, Pierce). Western blot analysis was performed with polyclonal antibody 1035, specific for fibulin-2 (35Sasaki T. Wiedemann H. Matzner M. Chu M.L. Timpl R. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 2895-2904Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and polyclonal antibody 9543, specific for fibrillin-1, 3N. L. Charbonneau, B. J. Dzamba, R. N. Ono, D. R. Keene, D. P. Reinhardt, and L. Y. Sakai, manuscript in preparation. both diluted 1:2000 in TBS and 0.05% Tween 20. Binding between lectin-like domains and isolated microfibrils was analyzed in solid-phase assays. Void volume fractions consisting of microfibrils were obtained from the non-dissociating Sepharose CL-2B column and used to coat 96-well plates (10 μg/ml, 100 μl/well) in 15 mm Na2CO3 and 35 mmNaHCO3 (pH 9.2) overnight at 4 °C. Coated wells were then blocked with 0.3% bovine serum albumin in 50 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.4) containing 0.15 m NaCl at room temperature for 1 h. Recombinant lectin domains (maximum of 1 μm) were serially diluted 1:3 in 50 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.4), 0.15 m NaCl, and 2 mmCaCl2 or 5 mm EDTA. The lectin domains were incubated with the immobilized microfibrils at room temperature for 3 h, and then the wells were washed three times with 0.05% Tween 20 in TBS containing 2 mm CaCl2. Color development was achieved by incubation with the alkaline phosphatase substrate p-nitrophenyl phosphate (tablet sets, Sigma) for 20 min. The absorbance at 405 nm was measured after the reaction was stopped with EDTA. Light microscopic immunohistochemistry previously demonstrated an elastic fiber staining pattern for versican in human skin (17Zimmermann D.R. Dours-Zimmermann M. Schubert M. Bruckner-Tuderman L. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 817-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Therefore, to determine whether versican is associated with fibrillin microfibrils, electron microscopic immunolocalization was performed. When neonatal skin was labeled with anti-versican mAb 2B1, antibody-directed gold labeling was observed decorating both microfibrils that were independent of amorphous elastin (Fig.1A) and elastin-associated microfibrils (Fig. 1, B–D). Although labeling was found all along microfibrils (Fig. 1A) and throughout microfibril bundles in elastic fibers (Fig. 1, B–D), a dense periodic labeling similar to that directed by fibrillin antibodies (1Sakai L.Y. Keene D.R. Engvall E. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 2499-2509Crossref PubMed Scopus (909) Google Scholar, 3Reinhardt D.P. Keene D.R. Corson G.M. Poschl E. Bächinger H.P. Gambee J.E. Sakai L.Y. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 258: 104-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar) was not evident. When human fetal membranes were first digested with purified collagenase and the supernatant was applied to the molecular sieve column, no peak was observed in the void volume (data not shown), indicating that microfibrils were not released from tissues by specific degradation of collagen. However, when the pellet was further digested with crude collagenase and the supernatant was applied to the sieve column, void volume fractions (Fig. 2A,bar) contained microfibrils of various lengths (Fig.2B). No other structural macromolecular aggregates (e.g. type VI collagen filaments, proteoglycan complexes) were apparent in low and high magnification fields (Fig.2B). Dot blot analysis of sieve column fractions confirmed the presence of fibrillin-1 in the void volume microfibril-containing fractions (data not shown). Dot blot analysis of all fractions from the column using mAb 2B1 demonstrated that the void volume fractions contained most, if not all, of the extracted mAb 2B1-reactive versican (Fig. 2A). Because monomeric PG-M/versican elutes in the middle of Sepharose CL-2B-included fractions (20Kimata K. Oike Y. Tani K. Shinomura T. Yamagata M. Uritani M. Suzuki S. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 13517-13525Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), these results, together with immunolocalization of versican to microfibrils (Fig. 1), suggested that versican might be associated with the microfibrils present in the void volume fractions. Alternatively, versican could be associated with high molecular mass aggregates other than fibrillin microfibrils present, but not apparent, in these fractions. To exclude the presence of microfibril-independent versican/hyaluronan aggregates, collagenase-digested samples were further subjected to hyaluronidase digestion. Both microfibril fractions and unfractionated samples were subjected to hyaluronidase digestion and chromatographed using Sepharose CL-2B. Versican mAb 2B1 reactivity remained primarily in the microfibril fractions (data not shown). To determine whether monomeric versican was present in the high molecular mass microfibril fractions, these fractions (Fig.2A, bar) were treated with chondroitinase ABC and subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. After chondroitinase treatment and dissociation of the sample in SDS, most of the Coomassie Blue-stained materials stayed at the top of the stacking gel, indicating that most of the protein present in the sample remained in large non-dissociable aggregates. Even sensitive immunoblotting failed to reveal the versican monomer or mAb 2B1-reactive fragments (Fig. 2C), suggesting that the immunoreactive versican present in the sample was unable to enter the running gel. To further test whether versican could be separated from the microfibrils, microfibril fractions from the sieve column (Fig.2A) were rechromatographed in buffer containing 4m guanidine. These dissociating conditions resulted in the separation of some noncovalently associated proteins. However, fibrillin-1 (data not shown) and versican immunoreactivities were still detected in the microfibril fractions (Fig.3). Collectively, these data indicate that versican is bound to macromolecules other than hyaluronan. Microfibrils were immunolabeled with mAb 2B1 to demonstrate specific association of versican with beaded strings of microfibrils. In negatively stained preparatio"

PPARα and PPARγ ligands have been demonstrated to exert anti-inflammatory activities in macrophages by repressing the activities of several transcription factors. PPARγ is expressed in T lymphocytes and may play a role in cytokine production, cellular proliferation, and susceptibility to apoptosis. Herein, we demonstrate that T and B lymphocytes constitutively express PPARα. PPARα represents the predominant isoform expressed in lymphocytes, whereas PPARγ dominates in all cell types of the myeloid lineage. PPARα expression was down-regulated following T-cell activation while PPARγ expression increased under the same activating conditions. PPARα expression in T cells may be regulated by microenvironmental factors, because Peyer's patch T cells expressed far greater levels of PPARα than T cells isolated from peripheral lymphoid organs. Exposure to specific ligand determined that PPARα in lymphocytes can effectively transactivate a peroxisome proliferator response element reporter construct. PPARα's ability to regulate endogenous genes, however, required treatment with histone deacetylase inhibitors. Finally, ligand activation of lymphocyte PPARα antagonized NF-κB.

The PPARs are able to positively regulate gene expression by binding to specific DNA sequences known as a PPRE as a heterodimer with the 9-cis-retinoic acid receptor. In the unliganded state, evidence indicates that the PPARs are associated with a nuclear receptor co-repressor (19DiRenzo J. Soderstrom M. Kurokawa R. Ogliastro M.H. Ricote M. Ingrey S. Horlein A. Rosenfeld M.G. Glass C.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2166-2176Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Upon activation, the PPARs undergo a conformational change that results in the dissociation from the co-repressor, enabling the PPAR to bind nuclear receptor co-activators. These co-activators then act to reorganize the chromatin templates allowing the basal transcription machinery to gain access to the promoter regions driving transcription of target genes (20Onate S.A.

We have recently demonstrated that NF-κB is present in an active state in both macrophages and lymphocytes, which reside in the spleen and other secondary lymphoid organs of aged mice (29Spencer N.F. Poynter M.E., Im, S.Y. Daynes R.A. Int. Immunol. 1997; 9: 1581-1588Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). This active NF-κB was further demonstrated to correlate with the normal constitutive expression of a number of NF-κB-regulated genes (29Spencer N.F. Poynter M.E., Im, S.Y. Daynes R.A. Int. Immunol. 1997; 9: 1581-1588Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). We subsequently reported that the administration of specific PPARα activators to aged rodents effectively reduced the elevated levels of active NF-κB in the spleens of these animals and re-established control over a number of NF-κB-regulated genes through a PPARα-dependent process (30Poynter M.E.

These findings suggest that the cell types residing within the spleen may be direct cellular targets for these PPARα activators. Of the major cell populations that reside within the spleen, only macrophages have been reported to express PPARα (31Chinetti G. Griglio S. Antonucci M. Torra I.P. Delerive P. Majd Z. Fruchart J.C.

We therefore questioned if other cell types residing within the spleen, including T cells and B lymphocytes, normally express this nuclear hormone receptor. Our results indicate, for the first time, that lymphocytes express PPARα. We further demonstrate that PPARα is the predominant PPAR isoform present within lymphocytes. This is in contrast to what is observed with macrophages, where PPARγ represents the major PPAR subtype. Our findings also suggest that microenvironmental variations within secondary lymphoid organs can influence the cellular level of PPARα expression in T cell but not B cells. Finally, we were able to demonstrate that treatment of T cells with highly specific PPARα activators can up-regulate the expression of endogenous PPARα controlled genes when histone deacetylase inhibitors are utilized. A colony of DO11.10 TCR transgenic mice was established from breeding pairs originally purchased from Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME). The derivation and phenotypic characteristics of these animals have previously been reported (34Murphy K.M. Heimberger A.B. Loh D.Y. Science. 1990; 250: 1720-1723Crossref PubMed Scopus (1650) Google Scholar). C3H/HeN mice were purchased from Charles River Laboratories (Wilmington, MA). Female mice were used for all of the experiments reported herein. All mice were housed in a specific pathogen-free barrier facility at the University of Utah Animal Resource Center, which uses sentinel animals to monitor for the most prevalent murine pathogens and guarantees strict compliance with regulations established by the Animal Welfare Act. Animals used were between 6 and 8 weeks of age, housed in filter-protected cages with a 12-h light-dark controlled cycle, and provided with mouse chow and water ad libitum. Mice were anesthetized with Metofane and sacrificed by cervical dislocation. TK.1, Jurkat, EL-4, and RAW 264.7 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). The murine B-cell myeloma cell line, P3X63-Ag8.653, was obtained from Dr. Jerry Spangrude (University of Utah). The T-cell hybridoma, DO11.10, from obtained from Dr. Jerold Woodward (University of Kentucky). Cell lines were maintained in RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen, Gaithersburg, MD) supplemented with 10% FCS (HyClone Laboratories, Logan UT), 200 mml-glutamine, antibiotics, and 5 × 10−5m 2-mercaptoethanol. The murine dendritic cell line, XS-52, was obtained from A. Takashima (University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center) and maintained as described elsewhere (35Caceres-Dittmar G. Ariizumi K., Xu, S. Tapia F.J. Bergstresser P.R. Takashima A. Photochem. Photobiol. 1995; 62: 176-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Where indicated, cells were treated with 10 nm trichostatin A (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO) alone for 18 h, or with trichostatin A for 18 h followed by a 6-h treatment with the specific murine PPARα ligand, GW9578 (a generous gift from Dr. Peter Brown, Glaxo Wellcome). For T-cell activation, enriched T cells were resuspended at a concentration of 5 × 106cells/ml and were activated in multiwell plates coated with a solution of 2 μg/ml anti-CD3 or 2 μg/ml anti-CD3 and 2 μg/ml immobilized anti-CD28 (PharMingen, San Diego, CA). For the preparation of splenic, PLN and PP lymphocytes, freshly isolated lymphoid cells were suspended at a concentration of 2 × 107 cells/ml in RPMI 1640 containing 5% FBS. The erythrocytes present in the cell suspension were lysed by brief treatment with sterile aqueous 0.83% (w/v) ammonium chloride. For T-cell isolation, single cell suspensions were incubated with 2 μg/ml biotinylated anti-CD45 and anti-CD11b antibodies (PharMingen) for 20 min on ice. For B-cell enrichment, the cell suspension was incubated with a mixture consisting of 2 μg/ml biotinylated anti-CD4, biotinylated anti-CD8, and biotinylated CD11b antibodies for 20 min on ice. Following washing with phosphate-buffered saline, cells were resuspended with M-280 magnetic Dynabeads coated with streptavidin (Dynal, New York, NY) incubated at a bead:cell ratio of 1:1 for 20 min with agitation at 4 °C. Cells bound to antibodies were depleted by two rounds of exposure to a magnetic field. The residual cells were collected, washed, and separated for use in culture or for mRNA analysis. The level of purity of the cell preparations was assessed by staining cells with FITC-anti-mouse CD4, FITC-anti-mouse CD8, and FITC-anti-mouse B220. The level of cell purity was routinely >95%. Reverse transcription was performed as previously described (30Poynter M.E. Daynes R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32833-32841Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). mRNA was isolated by the method of Chomczynski and Sacchi (36Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63088) Google Scholar), and PCR was performed in a fluorescence temperature cycler (Light Cycler, Idaho Technology) as fully described elsewhere (37Morrison T.B., Ma, Y. Weis J.H. Weis J.J. J. Clin. Microbiol. 1999; 37: 987-992Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The Light Cycler monitors the cycle-by-cycle accumulation of fluorescently labeled products. The cycle at which the product is first detected is used as an indicator of relative starting copy. Melting curves were acquired to determine specificity of the PCR (38Ririe K.M. Rasmussen R.P. Wittwer C.T. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 245: 154-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (1260) Google Scholar). PCR products for each of the primer sets were confirmed by running samples on an agarose gel. The PCR reaction was carried out in a 10-μl final volume containing 3 mmMgCl2, 0.2 mm dNTPs, 1:30,000 dilution of SYBR Green I, 5 μm (each) primer, 0.05 unit of Taqpolymerase, and 11 ng of TaqStart antibody. Oligonucleotides used for these analyses are as follows: Murine β-actin, 5′-GGG TCA GAA GGA CTC CTA TG-3′ and 5′-GTA ACA ATG CCA TGT TCA AT-3′; murine PPARα, 5′-GTG GCT GCT ATA ATT TGC TGT G-3′ and 5′-GAA GGT GTC ATC TGG ATG GGT-3′; murine PPARγ, 5′-CAA GAC TAC CCT TTA AGT GAA-3′ and 5′-CTA CTT TGA TCG CAC TTT GGT-3′; murine CPT-1, 5′-ACT TCC ATA TTT CTT CCA AGT TCT C-3′ and 5′-TCC AGG AAA TGT GGA GTC AAA TGT G-3′; murine Aco, 5′-CGA CCT TGT TCG GGC AAG TGA GGC GC-3′ and 5′-GGA GCT CAG ACG TGT CCC AGG G-3′. β-Actin transcript levels were used to normalize the amount of cDNA each sample, and Aco, CPT1, and PPARα transcript levels were reported relative to levels found in the control sample. Nuclear extracts were prepared from P3X63-Ag8.653 and EL-4 cell lines following treatment for 24 h with GW9578 or vehicle (0.1% Me2SO). Briefly, cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate buffered saline containing 1 mm PMSF and resuspended in 400 μl of buffer A (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.8, 0.1 mm EDTA, 10 mm KCL, and 1 mm MgCl2, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 100 μm leupeptin, 1 mm DTT, and 1 mm PMSF and 0.5% Nonidet P-40) and incubated on ice for 15 min. Nuclei were then collected by centrifugation at 20,000 ×g for 15 s at 4 °C. 50 μl of buffer C (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.8, 50 mm KCl, 300 mmNaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 100 μm leupeptin, 1 mm DTT, and 1 mmPMSF) was added to nuclei and incubated for 20 min on ice. Nuclear debris was removed by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 30 s. The supernatant was then removed, and protein content was determined by Bradford assay (39Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (214455) Google Scholar). Equal amounts of nuclear extracts (2 μg of protein as determined by Bradford assay) were incubated with 30,000 cpm of32P-labeled NF-κB-specific probe (Promega, Madison, WI). Reactions were performed in a 20-μl total volume containing 2 μg of nuclear extract, 4 μl of 5× gel shift binding buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm DTT, 0.5 mm EDTA, and 20% glycerol), 1.5 μg of poly(dI-dC), and 1 μl of probe. For supershift assays, 2 μl of an appropriate anti-NF-κB subunit antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) was added to each reaction. The reaction was incubated at room temperature for 15 min, loaded on a 4% native polyacrylamide gel, and run in 0.5 × TBE buffer (45 mm Tris, 45 mm Boric Acid 1 mmEDTA). The gel was dried and subjected to autoradiography. NF-κB-specific bands were confirmed by competition with a 100-fold excess of an unlabeled NF-κB probe, which resulted in no shifted band, or by preparing the reaction with excess labeled nonspecific probe, which did not reduce the intensity of the NF-κB band. Freshly isolated lymphocytes were plated on 18-mm diameter coverslips that were pretreated with 1 mg/ml polylysine. Cells were then fixed for 30 min at room temperature in 2% paraformaldehyde, washed with TBS, and permeabilized in TBS/0.2% Triton X-100 for 5 min at room temperature. The coverslips were then incubated in 100 μl of rabbit anti-mouse PPARα polyclonal antibody (Affinity Bioreagents, Golden, CO) or a rabbit IgG isotype control antibody (diluted 1:100 in TBS/1% bovine serum albumin) at room temperature for 60 min. After incubation, proteins were visualized using Alexa 594 (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) using a Leitz DMR fluorescence microscope. Transfections were performed as previously described (40Zabel M.D. Byrne B.L. Weis J.J. Weis J.H. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 4437-4445Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Briefly, 5 × 106 cells were resuspended in 0.65 ml of RPMI 1640 with 10% FCS and. 10 μg of pGL3Basic luciferase reporter construct (Promega) was used in transfecting TK-1 cells and 20 μg of NF-κB luciferase reporter construct (Dr. Andrew Thorburn, University of Utah) with 10 μg of murine PPARα expression plasmid (Dr. Ron Evans, Salk Institute) was transfected into Jurkat T cells. One microgram of pRL-TK Renilla luciferase reporter plasmid (Promega) was added to control for transfection efficiency. Cells were incubated with plasmids for 5 min in 0.4-cm electrode gap cuvettes (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and electroporated at room temperature using the Gene Pulser (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) set at 280 V and 960 microfarads (μF) for TK-1 and at 240 V and 960 μF for Jurkat. Cells were incubated for 5 min at room temperature then transferred to 100- × 20-mm tissue culture dishes containing 10 ml of RPMI 1640 with 10% FCS and incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. Luciferase assays were performed using the Dual Luciferase Reporter Assay system (Promega). Briefly, cells were harvested, centrifuged at 200 × g for 5 min, washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline, resuspended in 200 μl of 1× lysis buffer (Promega), and incubated at room temperature for 15 min. Cell debris was pelleted by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 5 min, and 180 μl of lysate was removed. Cell lysate (10 μl) was loaded into the well of a white opaque microtiter plate, and the dual luciferase assay was performed automatically using the MLX microtiter plate luminometer (Dynex, Chantilly, VA). Serial injection of substrates and monitoring of light emission for 10 s were performed for both firefly andRenilla luciferase. Computer software (Dynex) automatically subtracted background and normalized raw data by calculating the ratio of firefly:Renilla light emission values. Cytokine concentrations were measured by ELISA, as described previously (41Spencer N.F. Norton S.D. Harrison L.L., Li, G.Z. Daynes R.A. Exp. Gerontol. 1996; 31: 393-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Monoclonal rat anti-murine IL-2 antibodies and murine recombinant IL-2 cytokine standard were purchased from PharMingen (San Diego, CA). Statistical analysis was performed using a Student's t test with p < 0.05 deemed as statistically significant. To determine whether murine lymphocytes express PPARα, we utilized quantitative, real-time PCR to analyze PPARα mRNA levels in murine T and B lymphocytes. We initially analyzed primary CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and B cells isolated from the spleen of normal C3H/HeN mice and compared these to splenic macrophages, a cell type already known to express PPARα (31Chinetti G. Griglio S. Antonucci M. Torra I.P. Delerive P. Majd Z. Fruchart J.C. Chapman J. Najib J. Staels B. J. Biol.

The results of this study (Fig.1 A) demonstrate that splenic T cells (both CD4+ and CD8+) and splenic B cells express PPARα mRNA at levels that are higher than what is normally observed in splenic macrophages. In the lymphocyte populations, B cells were consistently found to constitutively express higher levels of mRNA for PPARα than T cells. We also evaluated two murine T-cell lines, TK.1 and DO11.10, as well as the B-cell myeloma P3X63-Ag8.653. PCR analysis revealed that these T- and B-cell lines also expressed PPARα (data not shown). We subsequently utilized immunofluorescence analysis to identify the subcellular localization of PPARα within splenic T and B cells. As shown in Fig. 1 B, PPARα protein was excluded from the nucleus in the majority of T cells. A similar localization of PPARα was also observed in B cells (data not shown). The cytoplasmic localization of PPARα in lymphocytes is analogous to what has been reported for unactivated macrophages (31Chinetti G. Griglio S. Antonucci M. Torra I.P. Delerive P. Majd Z. Fruchart J.C. Chapman J. Najib J. Staels B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25573-25580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (845) Google Scholar). Similarly, PPARγ is also found in the cytoplasm in resting T cells but is shuttled to the nucleus upon T cell activation (42Harris S.G. Phipps R.P. Eur. J. Immunol. 2001; 31: 1098-1105Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). It has already been demonstrated that lymphocytes express PPARγ and that macrophages can express both PPARα and PPARγ (31Chinetti G. Griglio S. Antonucci M. Torra I.P. Delerive P. Majd Z. Fruchart J.C. Chapman J. Najib J. Staels B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25573-25580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (845) Google Scholar). We, therefore, compared the relative levels of PPARα and PPARγ mRNA within the different lymphoid cell populations. As shown in Fig. 2, the levels of PPARα mRNA were three to five times greater than the level of PPARγ mRNA in all lymphocyte populations tested. This is in contrast to what was observed in cells of the myeloid lineage (macrophages, dendritic cells, and mast cells) where PPARγ represented the predominant isoform. It has previously been reported that PPARγ transcripts in T cells increases following cellular activation (43Clark R.B. Bishop-Bailey D. Estrada-Hernandez T. Hla T. Puddington L. Padula S.J. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 1364-1371Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar).

Here we show that mRNA production may not necessarily be limited to single genes, as human liver also has the potential to produce a variety of hybrid cytochrome P450 3A mRNA molecules. The four known cytochrome P450 3A genes in humans, CYP3A4, CYP3A5, CYP3A7, andCYP3A43, share a high degree of similarity, consist of 13 exons with conserved exon-intron boundaries, and form a cluster on chromosome 7. The chimeric CYP3A mRNA molecules described herein are characterized by CYP3A43 exon 1 joined at canonical splice sites to distinct sets of CYP3A4 orCYP3A5 exons. Because the CYP3A43 gene is in a head-to-head orientation with the CYP3A4 andCYP3A5 genes, bypassing transcriptional termination can not account for the formation of hybrid CYP3A mRNAs. Thus, the mechanism generating these molecules has to be an RNA processing event that joins exons of independent pre-mRNA molecules,i.e. trans-splicing. Using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, the ratio of one CYP3A43/3A4 intergenic combination was estimated to be ∼0.15% that of the CYP3A43 mRNAs.

The ongoing genome projects are allowing the determination of the coding potential of several eukaryotic species at a rapidly increasing pace. However, as most eukaryotic genes are in pieces, consisting of discrete exonic sequences flanked by noncoding intronic segments, defining the expressed fraction of the genetic material is obviously of highest priority. The puzzling problem of identifying relatively short exons in a vast excess of intronic sequences is further complicated by recent results indicating that, during gene expression, an additional level of complexity also exists. Specifically, in several higher eukaryotes, processed RNA does not always represent a simple linear combination of exonic sequences. Thus, in addition to canonical transcripts, gene expression may also result in scrambled RNA molecules in which exons juxtapose in an order that is different to that in the gene (1Nigro J.M. Cho K.R.

Moreover, the continuously increasing number of reports providing evidence for intergenic RNA molecules suggests that RNA splicing may also combine exons originating from more than one gene (Ref. 10Finta C.

Because a majority of these hybrid transcripts is known to encompass exons from neighboring genes that have the same orientation, a plausible mechanism for intergenic mRNA formation would involve bypassing transcriptional termination and formation of a bicistronic transcript followed by alternative splicing. However, a number of in vivo and in vitro experiments indicated that the mammalian splicing apparatus also has the capability to join exons originating from distinct pre-mRNA molecules, a process termed trans-splicing (15Solnick D.

All four genes consist of 13 exons and form a cluster on chromosome 7q21–22.1. Interestingly, comparison of GenBank™ entries encompassing various CYP3A genomic sequences revealed a rather unique arrangement of the CYP3Alocus, specifically that the CYP3A43 gene is in a head-to-head orientation with the other three, CYP3A4,CYP3A7, and CYP3A5, genes (Ref. 25Domanski T.L.

Zaphiropoulos P.G. Genomics. 2000; 63: 433-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 28Zaphiropoulos P.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 2585-2590Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Here we provide evidence that chimeric RNA production is not limited to the CYP2C genes on chromosome 10q24, but is also typical of the CYP3A genes. Specifically, in liver several hybrid mRNAs are produced that encompass the first exon of CYP3A43 joined to various sets of eitherCYP3A4 or CYP3A5 exons. In addition, because theCYP3A43 gene has an opposite orientation to theCYP3A4 and CYP3A5 genes, the mechanism of chimeric mRNA formation presumably involves splicing events between CYP3A43 and either CYP3A4 or CYP3A5 pre-mRNA molecules. Thus, these findings suggest that natural trans-splicing between distinct genes may occur in higher eukaryotes. Moreover, this intricate pattern of expressed mRNAs implies that novel alternative splicing pathways may significantly increase the complexity of human gene expression. Human total RNA was purchased from Invitrogen (adult human liver) or purified from HepG2 cells. HepG2 cells (ATCC) were grown at 37 °C, in an atmosphere of humidified air containing 5% CO2, in RPMI 1640 with l-glutamine medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Invitrogen), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen). Subculturing was performed at a subcultivation ratio of 1:6. Cells from confluent cultures were harvested by addition of trypsin, and subjected to RNA preparation using the SV Total RNA Isolation System (Promega). cDNA synthesis was carried out with Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Promega) in a 50-μl reaction mixture using oligo(dT) primers (25 ng/ml, Promega) with 10 μg of total RNA template. An aliquot of 1–5 μl of the reverse transcription reaction was directly subjected to the first amplification. Both the initial and nested polymerase chain reactions (PCRs) were performed in a 50-μl reaction mixture containing 20 pmol of each of the forward and reverse primers (Cybergene AB), 2 mm MgCl2, 200 μm dNTPs, and 1.25 units of Taq DNA polymerase (Promega). The oligonucleotides used in the PCRs are listed in Table I. The reactions were carried out for 30 cycles, with 10 s at 92 °C, 30 s at 52 °C, and 2 min at 72 °C. For the nested reaction, 1 μl of the first PCR was directly used. Alternatively, amplifications were done by using the Expand Long Template PCR System (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) for 30 cycles with 10 s at 92 °C, 30 s at 52 °C, and 2 min +5 s/cycle at 68 °C.Table IPCR primers and TaqMan probesPCR primersCYP3A4 exon 1, forward5′-AAA GAG CAA CAC AGA GCT GCYP3A4 exon 1, forward, nested5′-TCA GAG CAG AGA GAT AAG TCYP3A4 exon 13 reverse5′-GTC CTT AGG AAA ATT CAG GCYP3A4 exon 13 reverse, nested5′-TGC CAT CCC TTG ACT CACYP3A5 exon 1, forward5′-AAA CAG CAG CAC TCA GCT ACYP3A5 exon 1, forward, nested5′-TCA CAG AAC ACA GTT GAA GCYP3A5 exon 13, reverse5′-AGT CCT TAG AAT AAC TCA TTCYP3A5 exon 13, reverse, nested5′-GTT CCA TCT CTT GAA TCCCYP3A7 exon 1, forward5′-GCA GCA CGC TGC TGA AAACYP3A7 exon 1, forward, nested5′-TCA TCC CAA ACT TGG CCGCYP3A7 exon 13, reverse5′-CAT TTC AGG GTT CTA TTT GTCYP3A7 exon 13, reverse, nested5′-AGC TTT CTT AAA GAG CAA ACCYP3A43 exon 1, forward5′-ACA GAG CTG AAA AAG AAA ACCYP3A43 exon 1, forward, nested5′-TTG CCA TGG AAA CAT GGGCYP3A43 exon 13, reverse5′-CAA AAC AAT TTG AAG TGT CTACYP3A43 exon 13, reverse, nested5′-TGG TTG AAG AAT TGG TAG ATReal-time PCR primers and probesCYP3A43 exon 1, sense5′-CCA AAC TTT GCC ATG GAA ACACYP3A43 exon 2, antisense5′-GTT TAT GTG AAT GGG TCC CAT AAA TCYP3A43 TaqMan probe5′-6-FAM-TCT TGT GGC TAC CAG CCT GGT ACT CCT CT-TAMRACYP3A43/3A4 exon 1, sense5′-CAT GGG TTC TTG TGG CTA CCACYP3A43/3A4 exon 4, antisense5′-CAG GAT CTG TGA TAG CCA GCA CCYP3A43/3A4 TaqMan probe5′-TET-TGG TAC TCC TCT ATA TCT TTT ATG ATG GTC AAC AGC C-TAMRA Open table in a new tab The PCR products were cloned inEscherichia coli XL1-Blue cells using the pGEM-T Vector System (Promega).

Subculturing was performed at a subcultivation ratio of 1:5. Cells were transfected using the DEAE-dextran method (32Gulick T. Ausubel F.A. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A.

After 60–65 h of expression, cells were harvested in 0.01 m phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, and cell homogenates were prepared by sonication and subsequent centrifugation (10,000 × g, 10 min). Enzyme activity of total COS-7 cell lysates and human liver microsomes (Biopredic) was measured for 60 min at 37 °C in 500 μl of 0.01 mphosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, 0.1 mm EDTA using 100 μm [4-14C]testosterone (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) as substrate. The reaction was initiated by the addition of 1 mm NADPH (Sigma) and terminated by extraction with ethyl acetate. After extraction, separation and evaporation of the organic phase, products were dissolved in methanol and subjected for silica gel thin layer chromatography (J.T. Baker) in dichloromethane:acetone (3:1). Radioactive products were visualized using autoradiography. Systematic analysis of cytochrome P450 2C transcripts in human epidermis and liver revealed that, in addition to the canonical CYP2C mRNAs, several chimeric molecules were also produced (10Finta C. Zaphiropoulos P.G. Genomics. 2000; 63: 433-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar,28Zaphiropoulos P.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 2585-2590Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). These RNAs were characterized by encompassing exons from differentCYP2C genes, and some also had the potential to encode for chimeric CYP2C proteins. To test the hypothesis that intergenic mRNA formation is not only restricted to the CYP2Cgenes, we examined whether hybrid mRNA molecules were also formed between distinct members of the CYP3A gene cluster. Specifically, we performed nested RT-PCR on human liver RNA with primers from CYP3A43 exon 1 and CYP3A4 exon 13. The amplification resulted in three DNA fragments. Cloning and DNA sequence analysis revealed that these encompassed CYP3A43exon 1 spliced to CYP3A4 exons (Fig.2). The exons were joined at canonical splice sites, suggesting that the hybrid mRNA molecules were formed during pre-mRNA splicing. One combination consisted of all 13 exons characteristic of the CYP3A mRNAs and thus is capable of encoding for a chimeric CYP3A protein. Worth noting is that, in the other two combinations, the CYP3A4 exons that are spliced immediately after the CYP3A43 exon 1, i.e. exon 4 and exon 7, are in the same phase as exon 2. Therefore, all three detected mRNA molecules are characterized by open reading frames that start at the canonical ATG initiation codon and terminate at the canonical TGA termination codon (TableII).Table IICorrelation between translational reading frame and trans-splicingExonReading frameIntergenic species2−1+30−4−1+50−60−7−1+8+1−90−10+1−110+12−1+130−Note that all but one of the CYP3A exons that were found to juxtapose to the CYP3A43 exon 1 have a reading frame that is identical to the reading frame of exon 2. Open table in a new tab Note that all but one of the CYP3A exons that were found to juxtapose to the CYP3A43 exon 1 have a reading frame that is identical to the reading frame of exon 2. Nested RT-PCR amplification using 3A4 exon 1 forward and3A43 exon 13 reverse primers resulted in no products (data not shown). This suggests directionality in the formation of CYP3A43/3A4 intergenic mRNAs. To obtain additional evidence by a non-PCR-based method for the presence of intergenic CYP3A mRNAs in human liver, the RNase protection analysis was employed. Specifically, a riboprobe was generated (see “Materials and Methods”) that spans 68 bases of the CYP3A43 exon 1 to CYP3A4 exon 2 splice junction. The CYP3A43 exon 1 overlap was chosen to be of sufficient length (43 bases) that would allow efficient hybridization under the conditions used; however, the CYP3A4 exon 2 overlap was minimized to only 25 bases, to destabilize formation of RNA duplexes with the highly abundant CYP3A4 mRNA. As anticipated, protected fragments of a size of 68 and 43 bases were clearly visible (Fig. 3). Moreover, the intensity of the protected fragments increased with increasing amounts of input human liver RNA. The ratio of the two protected fragments indicated that the joining of CYP3A43 exon 1 to CYP3A4 exon 2 is a much more rare event than the canonical joining of CYP3A43 exons 1 and 2. In similarity with the CYP3A43/3A4 chimeric mRNA molecules, CYP3A transcripts encompassing CYP3A43 and CYP3A5 exons are also formed in human liver. Specifically, nested RT-PCR amplification using 3A43 exon 1 forward and 3A5exon 13 reverse primers resulted in two fragments. Cloning and subsequent sequence analysis revealed that both consisted ofCYP3A43 exon 1 joined to CYP3A5 exons (Fig.4). All exons were spliced at canonical sites, indicating that CYP3A43/3A5 hybrid mRNA formation was a result of a pre-mRNA splicing process. The CYP3A43/3A5 chimeric mRNAs also have directionality, as no products were detected in a nested RT-PCR experiment with CYP3A5 exon 1 sense primers combined with CYP3A43 exon 13 antisense primers (data not shown). In contrast to the CYP3A43/3A4 and CYP3A43/3A5 intergenic mRNA molecules, no transcripts encompassing combinations betweenCYP3A43 and CYP3A7 exons could be detected. Nested RT-PCR amplification using 3A43 exon 1 forward and3A7 exon 13 reverse primers resulted in no product in human liver RNA (data not shown). Moreover, no product was detected with3A7 exon 1 sense and 3A43 exon 13 antisense primers either (data not shown). We also repeated the RT-PCR amplification using RNA isolated from the HepG2 hepatoblastoma cell line that is characterized by higher CYP3A7 expression than adult liver. However, RT-PCR amplification with 3A43 exon 1 sense and 3A7 exon 13 antisense primers still resulted in no product (data not shown). An interpretation of the mechanism that generates CYP3A43/3A4 and CYP3A43/3A5 intergenic mRNAs could be the existence of a duplicated CYP3A43 exon 1 sequence, having the same orientation as the CYP3A4 and the CYP3A5 genes, that is used in a cis-splicing process. To test this possibility, Southern hybridization was performed on human DNA digested with various restriction endonucleases. A CYP3A43 exon 1-specific oligonucleotide was used as the probe. Fig.5 shows that hybridization resulted in single bands in all four DNA samples. Moreover, the estimated sizes for the DNA fragments fit well with those deduced from the genomic sequence, i.e. 4240, 1224, 4928, and 1961 bp forSpeI-, NdeI-, EcoRI-, andBglII-digested DNA, respectively. These results provide strong evidence that there is only a single CYP3A43 exon 1 in the human genome and thus indicate that the CYP3A43 gene is indeed the source of the 3A43 exon 1 sequences in the CYP3A43/3A4 and CYP3A43/3A5 intergenic mRNA molecules. The absence of a duplicated CYP3A43 exon 1 is also supported by the available genomic GenBank™ entries that cover the CYP3A locus (Fig.1). Therefore, because the CYP3A43 gene is encoded by a different DNA strand than the other members of the CYP3Acluster, including the genes for CYP3A4 and CYP3A5, the formation of the identified intergenic CYP3A transcripts can only be rationalized by splicing between distinct pre-mRNA molecules, i.e. trans-splicing. To obtain a quantitative measurement of the abundance of the trans-spliced CYP3A mRNAs, the hybrid mRNA molecule containing exon combination (1Nigro J.M. Cho K.R. Fearon E.R. Kern S.E. Ruppert J.M.

Activation of ERK-1/2 usually leads to its translocation from the cytoplasm to the nucleus, where it phosphorylates and regulates the activity of several transcription factors (27Chen R.H.

The activation of ERK-1/2 and its concomitant dissociation from MEK-1 both require tyrosine phosphorylation by MEK-1/2 (31Fukuda M. Gotoh I. Adachi M. Gotoh Y. Nishida E. J. Biol.

Cell. 1998; 93: 605-615Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar), although there is a fraction of ERK-1/2 that enters the nucleus passively, as a monomer (32Adachi M. Fukuda M. Nishida E. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5347-5358Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Nuclear retention of MAPKs influences their regulation of specific transcription factor activity during cellular stress in yeast (34Gaits F. Degols G. Shiozaki K. Russell P. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1464-1473Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Furthermore, retention of active ERK-1/2 in the nucleus of ovarian cells determines the duration of specific phases of the cell cycle, even in response to chronic growth factor stimulation (35Hulleman E. Bijvelt J.J. Verkleij A.J. Verrips C.T. Boonstra J. J. Cell. Physiol. 1999; 180: 325-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The accumulation of activated ERK-1/2 in the nucleus can also influence the cell cycle in PC12 cells (36Traverse S. Gomez N. Paterson H. Marshall C. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 1992; 288: 351-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (807) Google Scholar) and survival of fibroblast cells (37Lenormand P. Brondello J.M. Brunet A. Pouyssegur J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 625-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Active ERK-1/2 is retained within the nucleus by nuclear anchoring proteins, which may be short-lived and require ongoing protein synthesis to accumulate to functional levels (37Lenormand P.

Nuclear export of ERK-1/2 requires its dephosphorylation by specific nuclear phosphatases (38Reffas S. Schlegel W. Biochem.

Nishida E. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5347-5358Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). MEK-1 utilizes a potent nuclear export signal sequence to maintain its predominant cytoplasmic localization and return inactive ERK-1/2 to the cytoplasm for subsequent reutilization (29Reiser V.

In addition to their role in learning and memory, neuronal ERKs have been implicated in protection against neuronal cell death in vitro (10Abe K. Saito H. Neurosci. Lett. 2000; 292: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 16Xia Z. Dickens M. Raingeaud J. Davis R.J. Greenberg M.E.

Fukushima K. Kanda Y. Mizuno K. Watanabe Y. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2001; 13: 472-476Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, because additional models of neurotoxicity have been examined, contrasting effects of ERK-1/2 on cell survival have been observed. For example, the inhibition of ERK-1/2 protects neuronal cultures from cell death induced by seizure-like activity (4Murray B. Alessandrini A. Cole A.J. Yee A.G. Furshpan E.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11975-11980Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Furthermore, oxidative toxicity in both immature cortical neurons and a neuronal cell line could be blocked upon inhibition of ERK-1/2 activation (41Stanciu M. Wang Y. Kentor R. Burke N. Watkins S.

In addition toin vitro studies supporting a role for ERK-1/2 activation in neurotoxicity, neuroprotective effects were associated with the inhibition of ERK-1/2 activation in an in vivo model of ischemia (43Alessandrini A. Namura S. Moskowitz M.A. Bonventre J.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12866-12869Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). Because ERK-1/2 can be activated, often in the same cell type, by both pro-survival factors such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor (14Hetman M. Kanning K. Cavanaugh J.E. Xia Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22569-22580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar) and toxic stimuli (4Murray B. Alessandrini A. Cole A.J. Yee A.G. Furshpan E.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

In the HT22 mouse hippocampal cell line (46Li Y. Maher P. Schubert D. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1317-1324Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 47Tan S. Sagara Y. Liu Y. Maher P. Schubert D. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1423-1432Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar) and primary cortical neurons, oxidative toxicity is associated with persistent activation of ERK-1/2 (41Stanciu M. Wang Y. Kentor R. Burke N. Watkins S. Kress G. Reynolds I. Klann E. Angiolieri M.R. Johnson J.W. DeFranco D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12200-12206Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar). The inhibition of ERK-1/2 activation protects against glutamate-induced death in both HT22 cells and primary neurons, even if the inhibition is initiated hours after glutamate addition (41Stanciu M. Wang Y. Kentor R. Burke N. Watkins S. Kress G. Reynolds I. Klann E. Angiolieri M.R. Johnson J.W. DeFranco D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12200-12206Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar). Given the contrasting reports of ERK-1/2 involvement in neuroprotection and neurotoxicity, we sought to uncover the mechanistic basis for the association of ERK-1/2 activation with oxidative toxicity in HT22 cells. Our results suggest that compartmentalization of activated ERK-1/2 plays a major role in its promotion of neuronal cell death. Thus, caspase-dependent cell death that results from oxidative toxicity in a cultured neuronal cell line and primary neurons is promoted when chronically activated ERK-1/2 is retained within the nucleus. However, chronic activation of ERK-1/2 brought about by glutamate-induced oxidative toxicity or by the inhibition of proteasome-dependent protein degradation can be tolerated in HT22 cells if active ERK-1/2 is excluded from nuclei. The mouse HT22 hippocampal cell line is a subclone of the HT4 cell line (48Morimoto B.H. Koshland D.E. Neuron. 1990; 5: 875-880Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 49Maher P. Davis J.B. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 6394-6401Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) that was selected for its sensitivity to glutamate-induced toxicity. The cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Atlantic Biological, Norcross, GA). The anti-phospho-44/42 MAP kinase and anti-phospho-MEK-1 mouse monoclonal antibodies were obtained from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA), the anti-MAP kinase 1/2 rabbit polyclonal antibody was from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY), the anti-lamin B antibody was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA), and the anti-Hsp70 mouse monoclonal antibody was from StressGen Biotechnologies Corp. (Victoria, Canada). The phospho-ERK-specific peptide blocking was obtained from New England Biolabs. The fluorescein isothiocyanate-coupled anti-mouse IgG antibody was obtained from Roche Molecular Biochemicals, the Alexa 488 anti-mouse antibody was from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR), and 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole was from Sigma. Glutamate was dissolved in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) to 1 m and immediately used at 5 mm. For heat shock experiments, HT22 cells were placed in a 41 °C water bath for 60 min and then returned to 37 °C in 5% CO2. At different intervals after indicated treatments, HT22 cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS containing 0.1 mm Na3VO4 and collected on ice in 1 ml of PBS. The protein samples for blotting were prepared at 4 °C by resuspension of cell pellet in lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 2 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 10 mm β-glycerolphosphate, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 10 μg/ml microcystein, and 5 μg/ml aprotinin. Soluble extracts were prepared by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. The protein concentrations in isolated extracts were determined using a Bradford protein assay kit from Bio-Rad with bovine serum albumin as standard. Equal amounts of total extract protein (5–10 μg) were used for Western blot analysis (50Yang J. DeFranco D.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5088-5098Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Following transfer, the Immobilon membrane was blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 (polyoxyethylene 20-Sorbitan monolaurate; Fisher) and then incubated overnight with the anti-phospho-44/42 MAP kinase (1:1500) or anti-Hsp70 (1:1500) antibodies in 5% nonfat milk in PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20. In some cases, parallel blots were probed with an anti-MAP kinase antibody at a 1: 2000 dilution. HT22 cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 18 min, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min, and then incubated overnight at 4 °C with either anti-phospho-44/42 MAP kinase (1:300) or anti-44/42 MAPK (1:300) antibodies in PBS containing 10% goat serum. Incubations with anti-lamin B (1:250) or anti-MEK-1 (1:250) antibodies were performed for only 1 h. The fixed cells were washed five times with PBS and then incubated with goat anti-mouse secondary antibodies conjugated to either Alexa 488 (Molecular Probes) or fluorescein isothiocyanate (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) diluted 1:200 and 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. The stained cells were subjected to fluorescence microscopy using either a Nikon (Garden City, NY) Labophot microscope fitted with appropriate barrier filters or a Zeiss (New York, NY) laser scanning confocal microscope. Cell viability was assessed at 37 °C by measuring their ability to metabolize 3-(4,5-dimethyldiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) as described previously (51Xiao N. Callaway C. DeFranco D.B. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 95-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). HT22 cells were grown overnight in a 96-well plate (see above) prior to any treatment. 15 h following indicated treatments, 10 μl of MTT solution (5 mg/ml) was added to each well, and the cells were maintained in the same plate for 4 h at 37 °C. 100 μl of solubilization solution (50% dimethylformamide and 20% SDS, pH 4.8) was then added to each well. Following an overnight incubation, absorption at 570 nm was measured. The results were expressed relative to the control values specified in each experiment and were subjected to statistical analysis. All data were expressed as the means + S.E. of four independent experiments. The significance of the difference among groups was determined using analysis of variance post-hoc comparison (Scheffe or Bonferonni-Dunn test). The preferential accumulation of activated ERK-1/2 within the nucleus is one of the characteristic features of its activation by growth factors, mitogenic stimulation, and injury (5Brunet A. Roux D. Lenormand P. Dowd S. Keyse S. Pouyssegur J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 664-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar, 11Robinson M.J. Cobb M.H. Curr. Opin.

We had previously shown that glutamate-induced oxidative toxicity in the mouse HT22 hippocampal cell line is associated with the chronic activation of ERK-1/2 (41Stanciu M. Wang Y. Kentor R. Burke N. Watkins S. Kress G. Reynolds I. Klann E. Angiolieri M.R. Johnson J.W. DeFranco D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12200-12206Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar). Active ERK-1/2 contributes to toxicity in this paradigm, because HT22 cells can be protected from glutamate-induced cell death upon inhibition of ERK-1/2 activation (41Stanciu M. Wang Y. Kentor R. Burke N. Watkins S. Kress G. Reynolds I. Klann E. Angiolieri M.R. Johnson J.W. DeFranco D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12200-12206Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.1 (panel a), the dually phosphorylated, active form of ERK-1/2 is localized mainly within the cytoplasm of untreated HT22 cells. However, active ERK-1/2 compartmentalization is changed upon chronic glutamate exposure because its accumulation within the nucleus is dramatically enhanced in HT22 cells treated with glutamate for 6 or 9 h (Fig. 1, panels b and c, and Fig. 2). Although we cannot definitively rule out the possibility that other ERK isoforms, e.g. ERK-1b (52Yung Y. Hanoch T. Seger R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15799-15808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), contribute to oxidative toxicity in HT22 cells, the major bands detected in our Western blot analyses are p44 and p42 ERK-1 and ERK-2, respectively (41Stanciu M. Wang Y. Kentor R. Burke N. Watkins S. Kress G. Reynolds I. Klann E. Angiolieri M.R. Johnson J.W. DeFranco D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12200-12206Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar). Detection of the 46-kDa ERK-1b isoform in HT22 cell Western blots is variable and only visible upon prolonged exposure of the blots (data not shown). We therefore consider it likely that our IIF is predominantly visualizing ERK-1/2 localization.Figure 2Summary of active ERK-1/2 subcellular localization in HT22 cells. The subcellular localization of active ERK-1/2 was assessed within individual cells following IIF analysis and laser scanning confocal microscopy. 100 cells from random fields were chosen for each condition and scored as having either predominantly cytoplasmic (C>N), predominantly nuclear (N>C), or equivalent distribution in the nucleus and cytoplasm (N=C). glu, glutamate.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Inclusion of a phospho-ERK-1/2-specific blocking peptide during the antibody binding reaction of IIF analysis completely eliminated nuclear staining of active ERK-1/2 in glutamate-treated HT22 cells (Fig.1d). The fact that some residual cytoplasm staining is visible in IIF analyses performed with the blocking peptide (Fig.1d) suggests that the extent of active ERK-1/2 nuclear localization induced by glutamate treatment of HT22 cells may in fact be underestimated. Analysis of active ERK-1/2 nuclear localization by confocal microscopy in subsequent figures provides additional compelling evidence for induced nuclear transport of active ERK-1/2. A number of control experiments were performed to examine the specificity of glutamate effects on nuclear transport or retention. Previously published ultrastructural analysis using electron microscopy revealed that glutamate treatment of HT22 cells does not lead to nuclear swelling or affect the integrity of the nuclear envelope (53Tan S. Wood M. Maher P. J. Neurochem. 1998; 71: 95-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). We confirmed these results by IIF analyses with an anti-lamin B antibody (Fig. 1, panels e and f), which revealed no obvious effect on nuclear envelope integrity upon glutamate treatment. Furthermore, glutamate treatment of HT22 cells did not affect the subcellular localization of active MEK-1 (Fig. 1,panels g and h). Thus, the upstream activator of ERK-1/2 (i.e. MEK-1) remains cytoplasmic in response to glutamate treatment and is not efficiently retained within the nucleus. Nuclear retention of MAPKs is regulated at various levels and is influenced by its phosphorylation state (5Brunet A. Roux D. Lenormand P. Dowd S. Keyse S. Pouyssegur J.

Brunet A. Pouyssegur J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 625-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar) also indicates a role for unidentified short-lived nuclear proteins in MAPK nuclear retention. As shown in Fig. 3, cycloheximide protects HT22 cells from glutamate-induced toxicity, which is consistent with previously published studies (57Tirosh O. Sen C.K. Roy S. Packer L. Neuroscience. 2000; 97: 531-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Immature primary embryonic cortical neurons are also protected from glutamate-induced toxicity by cycloheximide (data not shown). Interestingly, activated ERK-1/2 levels remain high in cycloheximide-treated HT22 cells, even in the presence of glutamate (Fig. 4A). Although chronically activated, ERK-1/2 was not retained in the nucleus of glutamate-treated HT22 cells exposed to cycloheximide (Fig.5C and summarized in Fig. 2). Thus, as first observed in a fibroblast cell line (37Lenormand P. Brondello J.M. Brunet A. Pouyssegur J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 625-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar), persistent retention of active ERK-1/2 within the nucleus appears to require some short-lived nuclear protein. Importantly, HT22 cells are resistant to glutamate-induced toxicity if activated ERK-1/2 is excluded from the nucleus.Figure 4Maintenance of ERK activation upon CHXtreatment. HT22 cells were treated with 5 mm glutamate (glu) and/or 1 μm CHX and harvested after 3, 6, or 9 h. Active (A) and total (B) ERK levels were detected by Western blot analysis using an active ERK-specific antibody (A) or a p42/44 ERK antibody (B).

We demonstrate here that proteins isolated from human lenses contain significant levels of the UV filter kynurenine covalently bound to histidine and lysine residues. Identification was confirmed by synthesis of the kynurenine amino acid adducts and comparison of the chromatographic retention times and mass spectra of these authentic standards with those of corresponding adducts isolated from human lenses following acid hydrolysis. Using calf lens proteins as a model, covalent binding of kynurenine to lens proteins has been shown to proceed via side chain deamination in a manner analogous to that observed for the related UV filter, 3-hydroxykynurenineO-β-d-glucoside. Levels of histidylkynurenine and lysylkynurenine were low in human lenses in subjects younger than 30, but thereafter increased in concentration with the age of the individual. Post-translational modification of lens proteins by tryptophan metabolites therefore appears to be responsible, at least in part, for the age-dependent increase in coloration and fluorescence of the human lens, and this process may also be important in other tissues in which up-regulation of tryptophan catabolism occurs.

Post-translational modification of lens proteins by tryptophan metabolites therefore appears to be responsible, at least in part, for the age-dependent increase in coloration and fluorescence of the human lens, and this process may also be important in other tissues in which up-regulation of tryptophan catabolism occurs. The lens of the eye plays a crucial role in vision. Its chemical composition is unusual in that proteins represent ∼38% of the wet mass. The high concentration of protein is needed to achieve the refractive index necessary for focusing (1Sen A.C. Ueno N. Chakrabarti B. Photochem. Photobiol. 1992; 55: 753-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Crystallins constitute more than 90% of the lens protein and comprise three main classes, α, β, and γ, based on their aggregation behavior and sequence homology (2Bloemendal H. Science. 1977; 197: 127-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). The tightly packed and ordered distribution of the crystallins is essential for maintaining lens transparency and therefore vision (3). The lenses of humans and other primates contain low molecular weight compounds that act as intraocular filters by absorbing UV light in the 300–400 nm region (4van Heyningen R. Ciba Found. Symp. 1973; 19: 151-168Google Scholar, 5Cooper G.F. Robson J.G. J. Physiol. 1969; 203: 411-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), thus preventing UV-induced photodamage to the retina (6Zigman S. Paxhia T. Exp. Eye Res. 1988; 47: 819-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). These filters are produced through the catabolism of tryptophan. The first step in this process involves the oxidative cleavage of the pyrrole ring of tryptophan toN-formyl-l-kynurenine, catalyzed by indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (7Yamazaki F. Kuroiwa T. Takikawa O. Kido R. Biochem. J. 1985; 230: 635-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 8Takikawa O. Littlejohn T.K. Truscott R.J.W. Exp.

Recent work in our laboratory has led to the discovery of glutathionyl-3-hydroxykynurenineO-β-d-glucoside, a novel fluorescent UV filter that was found to increase in concentration with the age of the individual (13Garner B.

Kuck J.F., Jr. Exp. Eye Res. 1989; 49: 189-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). This increase is particularly prominent in the lens nucleus and is associated with changes to the crystallins (15Lerman S. Borkman R.

Because lens proteins, once produced, show little or no turnover (18Wannemacher C.F. Spector A. Exp. Eye Res. 1968; 7: 623-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), any post-translational modifications accumulate with age and may eventually contribute to age-related cataract (19Bando M. Nakajima A. Satoh K. Exp. Eye Res. 1975; 20: 489-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Several investigators have considered the possibility that UV filters may covalently modify lens crystallins (4van Heyningen R. Ciba Found. Symp. 1973; 19: 151-168Google Scholar, 20Stutchbury G.M.

Ophthalmic Res. 1990; 22: 152-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Our approach, however, has focused on the binding of these compounds to lens proteins without the involvement of UV light. Support for this proposal came from the mechanism of formation of novel human UV filters. For example, the glutathione adduct of 3-hydroxykynurenine glucoside, GSH-3-OHKG (13Garner B. Vazquez S. Griffith R. Lindner R.A. Carver J.A. Truscott R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20847-20854Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), is formed via deamination of the 3-OHKG amino acid side chain, yielding an α,β-unsaturated ketone that is highly susceptible to nucleophilic attack by the Cys residue of glutathione (GSH) (13Garner B. Vazquez S. Griffith R. Lindner R.A. Carver J.A. Truscott R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20847-20854Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Reduction of the unsaturated side chain in the lens yields another UV filter, AHBG (27Bova L.M. Wood A.M. Jamie J.F. Truscott R.J. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1999; 40: 3237-3244PubMed Google Scholar). Because Kyn has the same amino acid side chain as 3-OHKG, it should also undergo deamination. Indeed, in a model system, reaction of Kyn with calf lens protein (CLP) under nonoxidative conditions has been found to generate colored, fluorescent protein. Peptide mapping of Kyn-modified crystallins has revealed that all of the colored peptides contained His, Cys, or Lys residues (28Garner B. Shaw D.C. Lindner R.A. Carver J.A. Truscott R.J.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1476: 265-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 29Aquilina J.A. Truscott R.J.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

In this paper we demonstrate that proteins from human lenses contain covalently bound Kyn. Furthermore, we show that the Kyn is attached primarily to His, Lys, and to a lesser extent, Cys residues and that this pattern of covalent modification can be reproduced by incubation of the lens proteins with Kyn under conditions that promote deamination of the amino acid side chain. All organic solvents and acids were HPLC grade (Ajax, Auburn, New South Wales, Australia). Milli-Q® water (purified to 18.2 milliohms/cm2) was used in the preparation of all solutions. Human lenses were obtained from the Sydney Eye Bank (New South Wales, Australia) or from the National Disease Research Interchange (U. S. A.) with ethical approval from the University of Wollongong Human Ethics Committee (HE99/001). Fresh calf lenses (<2 years old) were obtained from Parrish Meats (Yallah, New South Wales, Australia). Amino acids (N-α-t-Boc-l-histidine,N-α-t-Boc-l-lysine, and cysteine) and Kyn sulfate salt were all obtained from Sigma. Sequencing grade HCl (6 m) was purchased from Pierce. Reversed phase high pressure liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) was performed on a Beckman System Gold® HPLC system equipped with a 127S solvent module and a model 166 UV-visible detector. For analytical scale separations, a Varian (Microsorb-MV™ C18, 100 Å, 5 μm, 4.6 × 250 mm) column was used with the following mobile phase conditions: solvent A (aqueous 4 mmammonium acetate, pH 6.5) for 5 min followed by a linear gradient of 0–50%; solvent B (80% acetonitrile/H2O, 4 mmammonium acetate) over 20 min followed by a linear gradient of 50–100% solvent B over 15 min and re-equilibration in the aqueous phase for 15 min. The flow rate was 1 ml/min. Semi-preparative separations were performed using the same conditions as those for the analytical separations except that a (Hypersil® BDS C18, 5 μm, 10 × 250 mm) column was used with a flow rate of 3 ml/min. Electrospray ionization mass spectra were acquired on a VG Quattro triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (VG Biotech Ltd., now Micromass, Altrincham, UK). Samples were dissolved in 50% aqueous acetonitrile containing 1% formic acid and introduced into the mass spectrometer by a Harvard Apparatus 22 syringe pump (South Natick, MA) at a rate of 10 μl/min. Nitrogen was used as both the bath and nebulizing gas, flowing at 350 and 10 liter/h, respectively. The capillary voltage was 3.2 kV, and the cone voltage ranged from 20 to 60 V. The source temperature was set to 85 °C. Calibration of the mass spectrometer was achieved using NaI. Spectra were acquired in positive ion mode at unit mass resolution using multichannel analysis. Typically 10–20 scans (scan rate 100m/z per s) were summed to obtain representative spectra. For tandem mass spectrometry the conditions used were the same as those described above except that the resolution of the first quadrupole was set to a minimum to increase transmission of the selected precursor ion. The collision gas used was argon at a pressure of 3.5 × 10−4 millibars, and the laboratory collision energy was varied between 25 and 45 eV to achieve the desired level of fragmentation. Only peaks with intensity greater than 20% of the base peak were reported unless additional data were pertinent. High resolution electrospray mass spectrometry was performed on a Micromass QTOF. The samples were infused into the electrospray ionization source with 50% aqueous acetonitrile at a flow rate of 10 μl/min. Protonated molecular ions were calibrated against a lock mass arising from a co-injection of a solution of polyethylene glycol in 50% aqueous acetonitrile with 1% ammonia added. LC/MS was carried out using an Applied Biosystems 140B solvent delivery system and 785A UV detector set at 360 nm with the VG Quattro mass spectrometer. Kynurenine adducts were separated on an Alltech Alltima C18 column (250 × 2.1 mm, 5 μm, 300 Å) at a flow rate of 200 μl/min using an 0–80% acetonitrile/H2O (each containing 1% formic acid) gradient over 40 min, a column oven temperature of 25 °C, and the source temperature maintained at 170 °C. All spectra were acquired in continuum mode with representative spectra obtained by summing 10–50 scans. One-dimensional and two-dimensional1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker Avance 400 spectrometer (1H, 400 MHz;13C, 100 MHz). For each compound, the following two-dimensional experiments were performed:1H-1H correlation spectroscopy (COSY),1H-1H rotating frame nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy (ROESY), and 1H-13C heteronuclear multiple bond correlation. All experiments were run in D2O and referenced to residual HDO. Coupling constants (J) are given in Hz. Fluorescence spectra were obtained on a Hitachi F-4500 fluorescence spectrometer (Tokyo, Japan) in three-dimensional scan mode. Slit widths were 5 nm for excitation and 5 nm emission, and the scan speed was 12 000 nm/min. UV-visible absorbance spectra were obtained using a Shimadzu UV-265 spectrophotometer (Kyoto, Japan). Milli-Q® water was used as the solvent in all experiments. Individual lenses were placed on dry ice, and the nucleus was cored (using a 6-mm cork borer) and separated from the cortex. The nucleus was then homogenized in absolute ethanol. After cooling for 1 h at −20 °C, the homogenate was centrifuged for 20 min at 14,000 rpm. The supernatant liquid was removed, and the pellet was re-extracted in 80% ethanol and centrifuged again. The supernatant was discarded, and the pellet was vacuum-dried. The sulfate salt of Kyn (50 mg) was dissolved in 50 mm Na2CO3, NaHCO3buffer, pH 9.5 (30 ml). The amino acids (N-α-t-Boc-l-histidine andN-α-t-Boc-l-lysine or cysteine) were added in 10-fold molar excess. The pH was readjusted to 9.5 with 0.1 m NaOH if required, and then the resulting solution was bubbled with argon, sealed, wrapped in foil, and incubated at 37 °C for 48 h. After adjusting the pH to between 4 and 5 with glacial acetic acid, the resulting mixture was separated by semi-preparative or analytical HPLC using the methods detailed above. The respective yields, high resolution exact mass measurements, NMR, and MS data for each adduct are given below. N-α-tert-Butoxycarbonyl-l-lysyl-d,l-kynurenine: 40 mg, 56% yield based on kynurenine.

Lens protein (∼10 mg) or Kyn-modified amino acids (N-α-t-Boc-l-histidine andN-α-t-Boc-l-lysine orl-cysteine) (2 mg) were hydrolyzed with 6m HCl (1 ml) for 24 h at 110 °C in an evacuated hydrolysis tube. After hydrolysis, the sample was lyophilized overnight and then dissolved in 400 μl of 0.1 mNaH2PO4 and 200 μl of 1 mNa2HPO4 (pH ∼ 5). The solution was then examined by RP- HPLC. 50 mg of CLP was dissolved in 50 mmNa2CO3, NaHCO3 buffer, pH 9.5 (10 ml). The sulfate salt of Kyn (10 mg) was added, and the pH of the resulting solution was readjusted to 9.5 with 0.1 m NaOH if required. The tube was bubbled with argon, sealed, wrapped in foil, and incubated at 37 °C for 4 days. The resulting mixture was separated on a Sephadex G25 PD-10 column (Amersham Biosciences Inc.) in Milli Q® water. The resulting protein fraction was extracted twice with ethanol to ensure that all unreacted Kyn was removed. Initial model studies involving Kyn and calf lens proteins had shown that Kyn was capable of binding to the proteins and suggested that Lys, His, and Cys may be the sites of covalent attachment (28Garner B. Shaw D.C. Lindner R.A. Carver J.A. Truscott R.J.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1476: 265-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Hence, the first stage in our investigation, to determine whether such Kyn adducts were present in human lenses, involved the synthesis of authentic standards of Kyn adducts of these amino acids. As we had demonstrated that basic conditions promote deamination of the Kyn side chain (27Bova L.M. Wood A.M. Jamie J.F. Truscott R.J. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1999; 40: 3237-3244PubMed Google Scholar), the Kyn amino acid adducts ofN-α-t-Boc-l-lysine (t-Boc-Lys),N-α-t-Boc-l-histidine (t-Boc-His), and Cys were prepared at pH 9.5.t-Boc-protected amino acids were used in the case of Lys and His to prevent reaction of the α-amino group. Cys was left unprotected, as the sulfhydryl group was the preferred site of reaction with Kyn (30Aquilina J.A. Truscott R.J.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 276: 216-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The reaction mixtures were analyzed by RP-HPLC, and the adducts were identified by ESI-MS of isolated peaks or by direct LC/MS. The major components were found to be the unreacted amino acid, Kyn, and the Kyn-amino acid adduct (∼1:1 diastereomeric mixture) along with deaminated Kyn and kynurenine yellow, the product resulting from intramolecular cyclization of deaminated Kyn (31Tokuyama T. Senoh S. Hirose Y. Sakan T. J. Chem. Soc. Jpn. 1958; 79: 752-761Google Scholar, 32Butenandt A. Schafer W. Gore T.S. Chemistry of Natural and Synthetic Colouring Matter. Academic Press, New York1962: 13-33Google Scholar). The Kyn adducts of t-Boc-Lys, t-Boc-His, and Cys were purified by semi-preparative RP-HPLC. The diastereomers were poorly resolved and therefore were not separated. Characterization of the adducts was achieved using a combination of UV-visible spectroscopy, three-dimensional fluorescence spectroscopy, tandem mass spectrometry, and NMR spectroscopy. One-dimensional and two-dimensional NMR spectra were acquired for each of the three Kyn adducts to confirm the site of covalent attachment. The one-dimensional 1H-NMR chemical shifts for each of the adducts are shown in TableI. The one-dimensional 1H-NMR spectra revealed four aromatic protons for each compound (H-3, H-4, H-5, and H-6) with chemical shifts and coupling patterns consistent with an unmodified Kyn aromatic ring. The side chain CH2-CH spin system of Kyn was observed in the COSY spectra of each adduct, with the diastereotopic methylene protons clearly discernible for the Cys-Kyn adduct. The downfield chemical shifts for CH-9 (δ 3.88-δ 5.32 ppm) and CH2-8 (δ 3.54–δ 3.82 ppm), were indicative of covalent attachment of amino acids at C-9 of the Kyn side chain. The site of these modifications was confirmed by ROESY experiments. The diagnostic cross-peaks observed in these spectra are shown in Fig. 1. In each case, cross-peaks were observed between H-9 of Kyn and the pertinent protons of the amino acids Lys, His, and Cys. These modifications were confirmed by heteronuclear multiple bond correlation experiments (data not shown), where the corresponding carbon-proton cross-peaks to those in Fig. 1 were observed. In the case of the t-Boc-His-Kyn adduct, cross-peaks between both the primary imidazole carbons and C-9 were also present. The structures determined via NMR spectroscopy were consistent with those predicted from a mechanism involving nucleophilic attack by the sulfhydryl or amino groups of the amino acids on the unsaturated side chain of deaminated Kyn.Table I1H NMR spectral assignmentsAdducts1H assignments (ppm)1-aSee Fig. 1 for numbering of the protons (1H).H-3H-4H-5H-6H-8H-9H-11H-12H-13H-14H-15H-19A6.777.316.707.723.623.973.041.651.551.653.821.32B6.727.276.677.713.825.328.697.273.12, 2.851-bDiastereotopic protons.4.101.19, 1.141-cResolved peaks of diastereomers.C7.19, 7.171-cResolved peaks of diastereomers.7.567.278.013.70, 3.59, 3.541-bDiastereotopic protons.1-cResolved peaks of diastereomers.3.883.37, 3.31, 3.23, 3.131-bDiastereotopic protons.1-cResolved peaks of diastereomers.4.17Adducts: A,N-α-t-boc-l-lysylkynurenine; B,N-α-t-boc-l-histidylkynurenine; C, cysteinylkynurenine.1-a See Fig. 1 for numbering of the protons (1H).1-b Diastereotopic protons.1-c Resolved peaks of diastereomers.

ESI tandem mass spectrometry (ESI-MS/MS) of the adductst-Boc-Lys-Kyn, t-Boc-His-Kyn, cysteinylkynurenine (Cys-Kyn), and the t-Boc-deprotected adducts lysylkynurenine (Lys-Kyn) and histidylkynurenine (His-Kyn) was also investigated. The ESI-MS/MS of both t-Boc-Lys-Kyn and t-Boc-His-Kyn exhibited a significant protonated molecular ion for Lys-Kyn (m/z 338) and His-Kyn (m/z 347), respectively, because of loss of the t-Boc group. Most of the major ions for the t-Boc and deprotected Kyn adducts of Lys and His were the same, thus facilitating the later identification of the Kyn adducts in the acid hydrolysates. For each of the Kyn adducts, the presence of the respective amino acid was confirmed by the observation of a product ion for the protonated amino acid (m/z 147, 156, and 122 for Lys, His, and Cys, respectively). The ESI-MS/MS spectra of all of the Kyn adducts showed product ions characteristic of the Kyn moiety. This included a diagnostic peak at m/z 192 for the deaminated form of Kyn. The UV and three-dimensional fluorescence spectra of His-Kyn following removal of the t-Boc-protecting group are shown in Fig.2. Removal of the t-Boc group did not alter appreciably the spectral characteristics. The UV spectrum of His-Kyn displayed an absorbance maximum at 361 nm. The His-Kyn adduct was also fluorescent, demonstrating a maximum fluorescence intensity at 410 nm excitation (Ex) and emission (Em) at 490 and 525 nm (Fig. 2, inset). Lys-Kyn and Cys-Kyn displayed similar UV and fluorescence spectra (Lys-Kyn UV maximum 361 nm, fluorescence Ex maximum 410, Em maximum 490, 527; Cys-Kyn UV maximum 357 nm, fluorescence Ex maximum 392, Em maximum 490, 527). By contrast, Kyn absorbs at 360 nm but is barely fluorescent at neutral pH. Because we wished to quantify the amounts of these Kyn derivatives in proteins, we first investigated the stability of the synthetic adducts under the conditions used for total hydrolysis of proteins. Therefore, each Kyn-modified amino acid adduct was subjected separately to acid hydrolysis (6 m HCl, 110 °C). Aliquots were removed every 6 h and the adducts analyzed by RP-HPLC. Although a small amount of decomposition occurred over the 24-h hydrolysis period, each of the adducts was recovered in high yield. For Cys-Kyn, recovery was 96 ± 2%, for Lys-Kyn 96 ± 2%, and for His-Kyn 99 ± 1%. To establish whether Kyn-modified amino acids could be recovered from proteins that had been exposed to Kyn, CLP was first incubated with Kyn at pH 9.5 to promote the reaction of Kyn with CLP. After 24 h, the Kyn-modified CLP was clearly yellow in color. It was purified and hydrolyzed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The hydrolysate was then examined by LC/MS. Fig.3 shows the LC/MS data for the hydrolysate. The major colored peaks were identified by correlation between the UV absorbance at 360 nm (Fig. 3 A) and the ion currents for the protonated molecular ions of His-Kyn at m/z347, Rt = 16.4 min (Fig. 3 B), Lys-Kyn at m/z 338, Rt = 15.8 min (Fig.3 C), and Cys-Kyn at m/z 313, Rt = 18.4 and 18.7 min (isomers) (Fig.3 D). Furthermore, the ESI-MS/MS spectra of each of these protonated molecular ions were identical to the spectra of the authentic standards (data not shown). As a control experiment, Kyn was added to unmodified CLP immediately prior to hydrolysis. No ions corresponding to Kyn adducts were observed in these experiments, thereby eliminating the possibility of artifactual formation of these adducts. Having established the applicability of the acid hydrolysis method, human lens proteins were then examined. Proteins from the nuclei of 20 human lenses, with subjects ranging in age from 16"

Here we show that Grb14 inhibits in vitro IR substrate phosphorylation. Grb14 does not alter the K m for ATP and behaves as an uncompetitive inhibitor for the IR substrate. Similar experiments performed with other members of the Grb7 family, Grb7 and Grb10, and with IGF-1 receptor argue in favor of a specific inhibition of the IR catalytic activity by Grb14. The IR-interacting domain of Grb14, the PIR, is sufficient for the inhibitory effect of Grb14, whereas the SH2 domain has no effect on IR catalytic activity. In Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells overexpressing both IR and Grb14, Grb14 binds to the IR as early as 1 min after insulin stimulation, and the two proteins remain associated. When interacting with Grb14, the IR is protected against tyrosine phosphatases action and therefore maintained under a phosphorylated state. However, the binding of Grb14 to the IR induces an early delay in the activation of Akt and ERK1/2 in CHO-IR cells, and ERK1/2 are less efficiently phosphorylated. These findings show that Grb14 is a direct inhibitor of the IR catalytic activity and could be considered as a modulator of insulin signaling.

Activation of receptor tyrosine kinases by ligand binding results in the autophosphorylation of multiple tyrosine residues of the cytoplasmic domain of the receptors. Phosphotyrosyl residues act then as binding motifs for multiple intracellular effectors, which interact through their Src homology 2 (SH2) 1The abbreviations used are:SH2Src homology 2IRinsulin receptorERKextracellular signal-regulated kinaseCHOChinese hamster ovaryPIRphosphorylated IR-interacting regionIRSIR substrateBPSbetween PH (pleckstrin homology) and SH2PTP1Bprotein tyrosine phosphatase 1BIGFinsulin-like growth factorIGF-1RIGF-1 receptorGSTglutathione S-transferaseWGAwheat germ agglutininFGFfibroblast growth factorSOCSsuppressors of cytokine signaling 1The abbreviations used are:SH2Src homology 2IRinsulin receptorERKextracellular signal-regulated kinaseCHOChinese hamster ovaryPIRphosphorylated IR-interacting regionIRSIR substrateBPSbetween PH (pleckstrin homology) and SH2PTP1Bprotein tyrosine phosphatase 1BIGFinsulin-like growth factorIGF-1RIGF-1 receptorGSTglutathione S-transferaseWGAwheat germ agglutininFGFfibroblast growth factorSOCSsuppressors of cytokine signaling domains, and initiate various signaling pathways (1Schlessinger J. Cell. 2000; 103: 211-225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3521) Google Scholar). Among the receptor tyrosine kinases, the insulin receptor (IR) behaves specifically since the main effectors, the IRSs and Shc families of proteins, bind through their phosphotyrosine binding domains (2Myers M.J., Jr. White M.F. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 1995; 6: 209-215Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). IRSs and Shc act then as scaffolding proteins, recruiting SH2-containing effectors. Searching for new proteins able to bind to the intracellular domain of the IR led to the identification of a new family of proteins, the Grb7 family of molecular adapters. This family comprises Grb7, Grb10, and Grb14 (3Daly R.J. Cell. Signal. 1998; 10: 613-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). These proteins possess a C terminus SH2 domain, which is implicated in the interaction with a number of receptor tyrosine kinases and also with different signaling proteins (for a review, see Ref. 3Daly R.J. Cell. Signal. 1998; 10: 613-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). However, in addition to the SH2 domain, another region of the protein is required for the binding to the IR. This region, located upstream from the SH2 domain, was called BPS (for between pleckstrin homology (PH) and SH2 (4He W. Rose D.W. Olefsky J.M. Gustafson T.A. J. Biol.

In the case of Grb14, the SH2 domain is dispensable for the interaction with the IR, the PIR being the main interacting region (5Kasus-Jacobi A. Perdereau D. Auzan C. Clauser E. Van Obberghen E.

Med. 2000; 5: 151-154PubMed Google Scholar). It is found associated with mitochondria where it interacts with Raf1 and is likely to be involved in the regulation of apoptosis (17Nantel A.

The role of the Grb7 family of proteins in the insulin signal transduction is still not fully understood. At the present time, available data are discordant suggesting either a positive or a negative role of Grb10 on insulin-induced mitogenesis (16Morrione A. Int. J. Mol. Med. 2000; 5: 151-154PubMed Google Scholar, 19Wang J. Dai H. Yousaf N. Moussaif M. Deng Y. Boufelliga A. Swamy O.R. Leone M.E. Riedel H. Mol. Cell.

Grb14 is specifically expressed in insulin-sensitive tissues, and insulin induces Grb14 binding to the IR in vivoin rat liver. In CHO-IR cells, the overexpression of Grb14 leads to an inhibition of insulin actions such as DNA and glycogen synthesis or tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins (5Kasus-Jacobi A. Perdereau D.

However, as already reported for IRS-1, this inhibitory effect could be due to the sequestration of downstream insulin signaling effectors (21Sun X.J. Miralpeix M. Myers M.G., Jr. Glasheen E.M.

The present study focuses on the elucidation of the molecular mechanisms implicated in the effects of Grb14 on insulin signaling. To get insight on the role of the association between Grb14 and the IR regulatory kinase loop, we determined whether Grb14 binding could alter the IR catalytic activity in an in vitro system. We demonstrate here that Grb14 inhibits the IR substrate phosphorylation activity and that this inhibitory effect is mediated through the PIR domain. In vivo in CHO-IR cells, Grb14 overexpression induces alterations in the activation by insulin of the Akt and ERK pathways. In addition, experiments performed with Grb7 and Grb10 and with the insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) receptor argue in favor of a specific inhibitory effect of Grb14 on the IR catalytic activity.

The IR and IGF-1 receptor (IGF-1R) tyrosine kinase activity was measured essentially as described previously (25Burnol A.-F. Loizeau M. Girard J. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 259: E828-E834Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Aliquots of the WGA-purified receptors (0.3 nm final concentration) were incubated for 1 h at room temperature in the presence or absence of 100 nm insulin or IGF-1 in 30 mm HEPES buffer (pH 7.6), 30 mmNaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 0.03% bovine serum albumin. The autophosphorylation of the receptors was performed during 30 min (IR) or 20 min (IGF-1R) at room temperature in the presence of variable amounts of the GST-Grb proteins in the kinase buffer (8 mmMgCl2, 4 mm MnCl2, 20 μm ATP, and 5 μCi/sample [γ-32P]ATP). Substrate phosphorylation was carried out using 2 μm of the synthetic substrate poly(Glu:Tyr) (4:1) (Sigma) and stopped after 30 min by spotting the reaction mixture onto 2- × 2-cm Whatman ET31 filter paper squares and immersing in 10% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid containing 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate. Papers were washed several times in 5% trichloroacetic acid containing 10 mmsodium pyrophosphate, and the radioactivity incorporated into the synthetic peptide was determined by Cerenkov counting. Results were expressed as percentage of the maximal insulin effect measured in the absence of GST fusion proteins. Similar experiments were performed using different GST-Grb14 concentrations and 5–100 μmATP (in the presence of 2 μm poly(Glu:Tyr) (4:1)) or 0.25–10 μm poly(Glu:Tyr) (4:1) (in the presence of 20 μm ATP) to calculate the K m andV max for ATP and poly(Glu:Tyr) (4:1) using a double-reciprocal plot (Lineweaver-Burk). Aliquots of the WGA-purified IR were activated by insulin as described above and phosphorylated for 30 min at room temperature in a kinase buffer (30 mm HEPES (pH 7.6), 30 mm NaCl, 8 mmMgCl2, 4 mm MnCl2, 100 mm ATP) in the presence or absence of 1 μg of GST-Grb14 (120 nm final concentration). The dephosphorylation reaction was performed using 1.5 μg of the protein tyrosine phosphatase PTP1B (Upstate Biotechnology) for 40 min at room temperature in an assay buffer containing 30 mm HEPES (pH 7.6), 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 2.5 mm EDTA, and 0.7% bovine serum albumin in the presence or absence of 2 mm orthovanadate. The reaction was stopped by addition of 4× stop buffer, and the samples were separated by reducing SDS-PAGE. IR phosphorylation was visualized by Western blotting using anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies, analyzed by densitometry, and quantified (Quantity One from Bio-Rad). Confluent CHO-IR or CHO-IR/Grb14 cells were serum-deprived for 24 h and stimulated or not with insulin (100 nm) for various periods of time. Cells were solubilized at 4 °C in lysis buffer (20 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 30 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 50 mm NaF, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mm orthovanadate). Lysates were cleared by a centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. For direct Western blots equal amounts of proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE analysis and immunodetected with the indicated antibodies. The immunoreactive bands were revealed using the ECL detection kit (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). The autoradiograms were analyzed by densitometry and quantified (Quantity One from Bio-Rad). For immunoprecipitations, after a preclearing step the lysates were incubated overnight at 4 °C with anti-Grb14 or anti-PTP1B antibodies in the presence of protein A-agarose (Upstate Biotechnology) or protein G-Sepharose (Sigma). After extensive washing in lysis buffer, the resulting immunoprecipitates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE as described above. A role for Grb14 on IR catalytic activity was investigated in vitrousing partially purified IR and recombinant GST-Grb14. The effect of Grb14 was first tested in vitro on the kinetics of IR autophosphorylation (Fig. 1 A). In the absence of Grb14, IR was markedly phosphorylated after 2 min of exposure to insulin. A maximal increase was observed after 5 min, and the phosphorylation was maintained for 30 min. The addition of 120 nm GST-Grb14 induced a slight decrease in IR autophosphorylation, which was significant only after 30 min (Fig.1 A). The IR kinase activity was then measured as the phosphorylation of the synthetic substrate poly(Glu:Tyr) (4:1) in the presence of increasing concentrations of GST-Grb14. As shown in Fig.1 B, GST-Grb14 strikingly inhibited IR catalytic activity. A 40% inhibition was observed for the addition of 2 nmGST-Grb14, and the activity was abolished for a concentration of 20 nm. The addition of up to 200 nm GST did not modify IR catalytic activity. Thus, the inhibitory effect of GST-Grb14 was specific to the Grb14 protein. The molecular adaptors Shc and SH2-B are also known to bind to the phosphorylated IR (5Kasus-Jacobi A. Perdereau D.

Genome. 1999; 10: 1160-1167Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). As shown on Fig. 1 B, these adapters did not alter IR catalytic activity, suggesting that Grb14 acts as a direct and potent inhibitor of IR substrate phosphorylation. As the phosphorylation of IR induces a conformational change that allows access to the ATP and to the substrate binding sites (30Hubbard S.R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5572-5581Crossref PubMed Scopus (779) Google Scholar), we determined whether the binding of Grb14 altered the kinetic parameters of the IR catalytic activity. First, increasing concentrations of ATP were tested in the presence or absence of 4 nm GST-Grb14 fusion protein. In the absence of Grb14, kinetics data obtained were in the range of values reported in the literature (31White M.F. Haring H.U. Kasuga M. Kahn C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 255-264Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Nemenoff R.A. Kwok Y.C. Shulman G.I. Blackshear P.J. Osathanondh R. Avruch J. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 5058-5065Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the presence of Grb14 the K m for ATP was not altered, but the V max was decreased by 30%, suggesting that Grb14 acts as a noncompetitive inhibitor for ATP (Fig.2 A). Similar experiments were then performed using increasing amounts of the synthetic substrate poly(Glu:Tyr) (4:1) in the presence of 0, 4, and 16 nmGST-Grb14. Three parallel straight lines were obtained on the Lineweaver-Burk plot, indicating that Grb14 modified bothK m and V max values (Fig.2 B). The K m for the synthetic substrate was only slightly reduced by Grb14, but the V maxwas decreased by 70–80%. These kinetics data are representative of an uncompetitive inhibitor. Taken together these results show that Grb14 reduces IR-catalyzed reactions without blocking the access to the ATP and to the substrate binding sites. The IGF-1R is a member of the tyrosine kinase family of growth factor receptors and is closely related to the IR (33Fantl W.J. Johnson D.E. Williams L.T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 453-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (932) Google Scholar). Grb14 interacts with the activated IGF-1R in vitro and in the two-hybrid system (not shown). The effect of GST-Grb14 was then tested on in vitro IGF-1R catalytic activity. As reported in Fig.3, the IGF-1R catalytic activity was less sensitive than IR to the inhibitory effect of Grb14: the addition of 6 nm GST-Grb14 decreased by 35% the IGF-1R catalytic activity compared with 80% for the IR. Thus, Grb14 is a weaker inhibitor of the IGF-1R than of the IR kinase activity. Grb7 and Grb10 are closely related to Grb14. To determine whether these two proteins could also act as IR tyrosine kinase inhibitors, the effect of the three Grb proteins was measured in the same assays and illustrated in Fig. 4. Whatever the amount of GST-Grb7 tested, the inhibitory effect was less than 50%, showing that Grb7 is a poor inhibitor of IR catalytic activity. In the case of Grb10, increasing the amount of Grb10 to 60 nm of fusion protein allowed a maximal inhibition of 80%. However, the entire dose-response curve was shifted to the right when compared with the Grb14 curve, indicating that the IR was less sensitive to the inhibitory effect of Grb10. The half-maximal inhibition of IR kinase activity was obtained for 11 nm Grb10 compared with 3–4 nm for Grb14. These results are in favor of a specific inhibitory effect of Grb14 on IR catalytic activity. The Grb7/10/14 proteins are characterized by a succession of interacting domains: an N-terminal proline-rich motif (PP), a central PH domain, a PIR (or BPS) (4He W. Rose D.W. Olefsky J.M.

Signal. 1998; 10: 613-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) (Fig.5 A). To determine whether a particular domain of Grb14 was responsible for its inhibitory effect, the IR catalytic activity was measured in the presence of increasing amounts of the various Grb14 domains expressed as GST fusion proteins. The Grb14 N-terminal region, deleted of the PIR and SH2 domains, did not modify the in vitro IR catalytic activity (data not shown). However, as shown in Fig. 5 B, the GST-PIR of Grb14 strongly inhibited the IR kinase activity: a 55% inhibition was observed for 12 nm GST-PIR, and the kinase activity was fully inhibited for a concentration of 120 nm. In contrast, the GST-SH2 Grb14 fusion protein did not alter the IR catalytic activity (Fig. 5 C). Similar experiments were performed using the different domains of Grb7 and Grb10. As reported for Grb14, the inhibitory effect of Grb7 and Grb10 on the IR kinase activity was due to the PIR, the SH2 domain alone having no effect"
https://openalex.org/W1985767656,"In skeletal muscle, excitation-contraction (EC) coupling and retrograde signaling are thought to result from direct interactions between the ryanodine receptor (RyR1) and the α1 subunit of the dihydropyridine receptor (α1S). Previous work has shown that the s53 region of α1S (residues 720–765 in the II–III loop) and regions R10 (1635–2636) and R9 (2659–3720) of RyR1 are involved in this signaling. Using the yeast two-hybrid system, we here report an interaction between s53 and the sR16 region of RyR1 (1837–2168, within R10), whereas no interaction was seen using upstream residues of the α1S II–III loop (s31, 666–709). The specificity of the s53-sR16 interaction was tested by using fragments of the cardiac RyR (RyR2) and DHPR (α1C) that correspond to sR16 and s53, respectively. No interaction was observed for sR16 × c53 (α1C 850–897), but weak interaction was occasionally observed for s53 × cR16 (RyR2 1817–2142). To test the functional significance of the s53 × sR16 interaction, we expressed in dyspedic myotubes a chimeric RyR (chimeraR16) in which sR16 was substituted for the corresponding region of RyR2. ChimeraR16 was found to mediate weak skeletal-type EC coupling. To test the necessity of sR16 sequence for coupling, we used “chimeraR16-rev,” in which sR16 and a small upstream region of RyR1 were replaced by RyR2 sequence. ChimeraR16-rev did not differ from RyR1 in its ability to mediate EC coupling. Thus, interaction between residues 720–765 of α1S and residues 1837–2168 of RyR1 appears to contribute to but is not essential for EC coupling in skeletal muscle. In skeletal muscle, excitation-contraction (EC) coupling and retrograde signaling are thought to result from direct interactions between the ryanodine receptor (RyR1) and the α1 subunit of the dihydropyridine receptor (α1S).

In muscle cells, excitation-contraction (EC) 1ECexcitation-contractionDHPRdihydropyridine receptorRyRryanodine receptor 1ECexcitation-contractionDHPRdihydropyridine receptorRyRryanodine receptor coupling is the process by which depolarization of the plasma membrane produces the large transient release of Ca2+ from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, which in turn triggers contraction. Dihydropyridine receptors (DHPRs), L-type Ca2+ channels in the plasmalemma, serve as the voltage sensors for EC coupling (1Rios E. Brum G. Nature. 1987; 325: 717-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar) and activate ryanodine receptors (RyRs), intracellular Ca2+ release channels in the sarcoplasmic reticulum membrane (2Imagawa T.

Nature. 1988; 331: 315-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In cardiac muscle, entry of Ca2+ through the DHPR activates the RyR (4Nabauer M. Callewaert G. Cleemann L. Morad M. Science. 1989; 244: 800-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). In skeletal muscle, however, entry of Ca2+ through the DHPR is not required for EC coupling (5Armstrong C.M. Bezanilla F.M. Horowicz P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1972; 267: 605-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Instead, a voltage-dependent conformational change in the II–III loop of the skeletal muscle DHPR α1 subunit (α1S) has been hypothesized to allosterically activate the skeletal muscle ryanodine receptor, RyR1. In addition to this orthograde EC coupling signal, which is transmitted from α1S to RyR1, there is also a retrograde signal whereby the presence of RyR1 increases the Ca2+current density produced by α1S (6Nakai J. Dirksen R.T. Nguyen H.T. Pessah I.N. Beam K.G. Allen P.D.

Expression of chimeric DHPR α1subunits in dysgenic muscle (which lacks α1S) has revealed that α1S residues 720–765 in the intracellular loop between domains II and III (the II–III loop) are necessary for bi-directional signaling in dysgenic myotubes (7Nakai J.

Similarly, expression of chimeric RyRs in dyspedic myotubes (which lack RyR1) has shown that regions R9 (residues 2659–3720) and R10 (residues 1635–2636) of RyR1 participate in signaling interactions with α1S (9Nakai J. Sekiguchi N. Tando T. Allen P. Beam K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13403-13406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Despite these functional data, there is little evidence as to whether signaling between α1S and RyR1 results from direct contact between the two proteins. A number of studies have addressed this question in vitro. Direct binding in protein affinity columns has identified interactions between peptides corresponding to the II–III (10Leong P. MacLennan D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7791-7794Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) and III–IV (11Leong P. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29958-29964Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) loops of α1S and a peptide corresponding to residues 951–1112 of RyR1 (but not to the equivalent RyR2 residues). However, replacement of this region of RyR1 with the equivalent RyR2 residues in chimeric RyRs does not interfere with bi-directional interactions in functional assays (9Nakai J. Sekiguchi N. Tando T. Allen P. Beam K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13403-13406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). The responses of isolated RyRs to peptides corresponding to specific regions of DHPRs have also been used to study interactions between α1S and RyR1. In particular, residues 671–690 of α1S (“peptide A”) or subdivisions of this region have been found to activate RyR1 (12Lu X., Xu, L. Meissner G. J. Biol.

The divergent results of functional and biochemical studies are difficult to reconcile and may indicate that there are multiple sites of contact, individually of low affinity, that mediate signaling between α1S and RyR1. In this paper, we have attempted to identify domains of α1S and RyR1 that participate in both direct binding and functional coupling between the two proteins. Using the yeast two-hybrid system, we have observed a weak interaction between the s53 region of the α1S II–III loop (residues 720–765) and the sR16 region of RyR1 (residues 1837–2168 within R10). The functional significance of this interaction was tested using chimeric RyRs expressed in dyspedic myotubes. When substituted into a RyR2 backbone, region sR16 was sufficient to confer weak skeletal-type EC coupling (“chimeraR16”). The mirror chimera (“chimeraR16-rev”), in which sR16 and an upstream region of RyR1 were replaced by RyR2 sequence, was used to test whether skeletal sequence in the R16 region was required for bi-directional signaling. ChimeraR16-rev did not differ significantly from RyR1 in its coupling with α1S. These results suggest that R16 is one site of contact between RyR1 and DHPRs that participates in EC coupling and that other such sites likely exist. For yeast two-hybrid interaction tests, portions of the rabbit skeletal muscle ryanodine receptor (RyR1) (21Takeshima H. Nishimura S. Matsumoto T. Ishida H. Kangawa K. Minamino N. Matsuo H. Ueda M.

For yeast two-hybrid clones, the template used, the amino acids expressed (in parentheses), and the primer pairs used were as follows: R10A (RyR1 1633–1858), 5′-GGAATTCCCCGTGACCATGATGGCG-3′, 5′-CGGGATCCAT-CCTCATCCCAAAGATGC-3′; R16 (RyR1 1837–2168), 5′-GCGAATTCCAGTTCGTGCCGGTGCTCAAG-3′, 5′-GCGGATCCGAGCGGCATCTTGGCGAACTCGTT-3′; R10B (RyR1 2165–2414), 5′-GGAATTCGTGCTCATCGTGCAGATGG-3′, 5′-CGGGATCCTTCTTCAGGTGGCTCCTCCCC-3′; R10C (RyR1 2408–2636), 5′-GGAATTCGAGGAGCCCCCTGAAGAAAAC-3′, 5′-CGGGATCCGAACTCGTTCAGGATGGGC-3′; R9A (RyR1 2636–2956), 5′-GGAATTCTTCGCCAAGATGCCGCTCA-3′, 5′-CGGGATCCGGCGAACCGCTTCTCAATGGA-3′; R9B (RyR1 2950–3252), 5′-GGAATTCTCCATTGAGAAGCGGTTCGCC-3′, 5′-cgggatccgtctgccaTGAGCCGATCCAG-3′; R9C (RyR1 3246–3552), 5′-GGAATTCCTGGATCGGCTCATGGCAGAC-3′, 5′-CGGGATCCAAATTCCCGGACCTCCTCGTC-3′; cR16 (RyR2 1817–2142), 5′-GCGAATTCCTCTTTGTGCCTCTCATC-3′, 5′-CGGGATCCCATAAGCTTCTCTTCCTCTTT-3′; s31 (α1S 666–709), 5′-GGAATTCGAGGCGGAGAGCCTGACTTCC-3′, 5′-CGGGATCCGGGCTTCTGCTCCAGCTTCTT-3′; s53 (α1S, 719–766), 5′-GGAATTCAAGCTCAAGGTCGATGAG-3′, 5′-CGGGATCCTTGAGCTGCAGCTCGGC-3′; c53 (α1C 850–897), 5′-GGAATTCAAGATCAACATGGATGAC-3′, 5′-CGGGATCCTTAAGGTGCAGCTCGGAG-3′; s31 (α1S 666–709), 5′-GGAATTCGAGGCGGAGAGCCTGACTTCC-3′, 5′-CGGGATCCGGGCTTCTGCTCCAGCTTCTT-3′; s53 (α1S, 719–766), 5′-GGAATTCAAGCTCAAGGTCGATGAG-3′, 5′-CGGGATCCTTGAGCTGCAGCTCGGC-3′; c53 (α1C 850–897), 5′-GGAATTCAAGATCAACATGGATGAC-3′, 5′-CGGGATCCTTAAGGTGCAGCTCGGAG-3′; αID (α1S, 342–382), 5′-GGAATTCGAGAAGGCCAAGTCCAGGGGAACC-3′, 5′-CGGGATCCTCTCAGGTCCTCCACGTCCATGAC-3′; and βID (β1A151–330), 5′-GGAATTCAAGGAGGGCTGCGAGGTT-3′, 5′-CGGGATCCTGCTGGGGTTGTTGAGGA-3′. Interactions between portions of DHPRs and RyRs were assayed by expression of GAL4 activation and binding domain fusion proteins in the yeast strain HF7c using the Matchmaker Yeast Two-Hybrid kit according to manufacturer's protocols (CLONTECH). Pooled colonies collected from SD/−Trp/−Leu plates were spread on SD/−Trp/−Leu/−His plates and examined for the appearance of colonies after incubation for 4–10 days at 30 °C. Each transformation was repeated 5–15 times. β-Galactosidase activity was determined qualitatively by the appearance of a blue substrate in a filter lift assay. The mammalian expression plasmid chimeraR16 was constructed by substituting nucleotides 5508–6462 of RyR1 for nucleotides 5449–6354 of RyR2 using EcoRI and XhoI restriction sites. This produced a chimeric ryanodine receptor that is RyR2 in sequence except for replacement of residues 1817–2118 by the residues 1837–2154 of RyR1. The plasmid encoding chimeraR16-rev was constructed by ligating a PCR fragment comprised of RyR2 nucleotides 4912–6358 into the AgeI (4936) and XhoI (6466) sites in pCIneoRyR1 (6Nakai J. Dirksen R.T. Nguyen H.T. Pessah I.N. Beam K.G. Allen P.D. Nature. 1996; 380: 72-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). This resulted in a chimeric ryanodine receptor that had RyR1 sequence except for replacement of residues 1645–2154 by RyR2 residues 1637–2118. Primary cultures of myotubes were prepared from newborn dyspedic mice as previously described (27Adams B.A. Beam K.G. J. Gen. Physiol. 1989; 94: 429-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Approximately 1 week after plating, plasmids carrying cDNA for RyR1, RyR2, chimeraR16, or chimeraR16-rev (0.3 μg/μl) were microinjected along with cDNA encoding either the CD8 antigen (0.2 μg/μl) (28Jurman M.E. Boland L.M. Liu Y. Yellen G. BioTechniques. 1994; 17: 876-881PubMed Google Scholar) or green fluorescent protein (0.04 μg/μl) (29Grabner M. Dirksen R.T. Beam K.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1903-1908Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) into single nuclei. Injected myotubes were identified either by binding of CD8 antibody-coated beads (Dynabeads M-450; Dynal AS, Oslo, Norway) or by green fluorescence 48–72 h after injection. Expressing cells were examined for voltage-sensitive Ca2+ currents, the ability to contract in response to electrical stimulation, and intracellular Ca2+transients. Macroscopic Ca2+ currents and intracellular Ca2+ transients were measured simultaneously (30Garcı́a J. Beam K.G. J. Gen. Physiol. 1994; 103: 107-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) using borosilicate glass patch pipettes, which had resistances of 1.5–2.0 MΩ when filled with an internal solution containing 145 mm cesium glutamate, 2 mm Cs2Cl, 8 mm MgATP, 10 mm EGTA, 10 mm HEPES, and 0.5 mm K5Fluo-3 (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) (pH 7.4 with CsOH). The composition of the standard extracellular solution was 10 mm CaCl2, 145 mmtetraethylammonium chloride, 0.003 mm tetrodotoxin, and 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4 with tetraethylammonium hydroxide). The voltage clamp command sequence was to step from a holding potential of −80 mV to −30 mV for 1 s, to −50 mV for 30 ms, to the test potential for 200 ms, to −50 mV for 125 ms, and then back to the holding potential. Control currents elicited by 20–40 mV hyperpolarizations from the holding potential were used to measure linear capacitance (cells > 800 picofarads were excluded from further analysis) and to correct test currents for linear components of leakage and capacitative currents by means of digital scaling and subtraction. The cells were examined for their ability to contract in response to electrical stimulation (90–100 V, 5–10 ms). For electrically evoked contractions in the absence of Ca2+entry through α1S, the cells were bathed either in Rodent Ringers in which the Ca2+ had been replaced by Mg2+ (145 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 3 mm MgCl2 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4 with NaOH) or, for chimeraR16-rev, in tissue culture medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; Sigma) containing 0.5 mmCdCl2 and 0.1 mm LaCl3. All data are presented as the means ± S.E. To test the hypothesis that skeletal-type EC coupling results from a direct physical interaction between the II–III loop of α1S and a discrete domain of RyR1, we used the yeast two-hybrid system to test for interaction between regions of the two proteins that were previously identified in functional studies. In yeast, we expressed two regions of the α1S II–III loop as fusion proteins with the binding domain of the GAL4 transcription factor: s53 (α1S residues 719–767) and s31 (α1S 666–709). We also expressed, as fusion proteins with the activation domain of GAL4, subdivisions of the R9 and R10 regions of RyR1 that were previously identified as important for signaling interactions with α1S (9Nakai J. Sekiguchi N. Tando T. Allen P. Beam K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13403-13406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). These subdivisions were ∼300 residues in length, the maximum size that can be tested using the two-hybrid system. The skeletal constructs are indicated in Fig. 1 and are designated with the prefix “s.” To determine the specificity of interactions between RyR1 and α1S, we also tested corresponding regions of α1C and RyR2 for interactions; the cardiac constructs are designated with the prefix “c.” c53 (α1C residues 850–897) corresponds to s53, and cR16 (RyR2 1817–2142) corresponds to sR16. Yeast co-transformed with pairs of constructs indicated in Fig. 1 were plated onto nutritional selection medium (SD/−Trp/−Leu/−His). Colonies (which indicate an interaction between the test fragments) were never observed for yeast co-transformed with s31 and any of the RyR constructs. This absence of colonies suggests that the s31 region does not interact with the RyR domains tested and is consistent with experiments using expression in myotubes demonstrating that this region of α1S is not critical for signaling interactions with RyR1 (7Nakai J. Tanabe T. Konno T. Adams B. Beam K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24983-24986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 19Proenza C. Wilkens C.M. Beam K.G. J. Biol.

A. 2001; 98: 5892-5897Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In contrast, colonies were consistently observed for yeast co-transformed with sR16 and s53 (n = 15), although their appearance required incubation of the plates for 7–10 days. This indicates that the interaction is quite weak, because colonies appeared within 2–4 days (data not shown) for yeast co-transformed with αID and βID, which are responsible for the strong binding of the β subunit to α1S (31Pragnell M. Waard D. Mori Tanabe T. Snutch T.P. Campbell K. Nature. 1994; 368: 67-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar). ThelacZ reporter gene (which encodes β-galactosidase) yielded similar results; a blue reaction product, indicating expression of β-galactosidase, was observed for yeast containing s53 and sR16 in four of four separate transformations. To ensure that the yeast two-hybrid positive result for the s53 × sR16 interaction was independent of the GAL4 segments of the fusion proteins, we constructed the mirror clones with s53 inserted into the GAL4 activation domain vector and sR16 inserted into the GAL4 binding domain vector. An interaction was observed in three of four transformations performed with this pair of clones. The specificity of the interaction between s53 and sR16 was also tested by replacing them with c53 and cR16, respectively. The colonies were not observed for c53 when co-transformed with any of the RyR1 segments (n = 5) but were occasionally seen on test plates streaked with yeast bearing cR16 and s53 (5 of 14 transformations). Thus, s53 is also able to interact with the cR16 region of RyR2, albeit less efficiently than with the sR16 region of RyR1. To determine whether there was a physiological correlate of the yeast interaction between s53 and sR16, we constructed chimeraR16, a chimeric skeletal-cardiac ryanodine receptor. ChimeraR16 had RyR2 sequence except for replacement of residues 1817–2118 by the corresponding region of RyR1 (1837–2154). Thus, chimeraR16 contained all but the final 14 residues (2155–2168) of sR16, which were omitted for cloning reasons and which, because RyR1 and RyR2 are highly conserved in this region, resulted in only three amino acid changes (E2157A, C2158S, and I2167S, using RyR1 numbering). RyR1, chimeraR16, and RyR2 were expressed in dyspedic myotubes (which lack endogenous RyR1). Whole cell patch clamping in combination with the Ca2+ indicator Fluo-3 was used for the simultaneous measurement of Ca2+currents and Ca2+ transients resulting from intracellular release. Because skeletal EC coupling is defined as being independent of entry of Ca2+ through the DHPR, we first tested chimeraR16 for the ability to participate in EC coupling when Ca2+ current was blocked by 0.1 mmCd2+ and 0.5 mm La3+ (10 of 22 cells expressing chimeraR16 were tested in this fashion). Fig.2 A illustrates representative Ca2+ currents and transients recorded from myotubes expressing RyR1, chimeraR16, or RyR2. For RyR1, large Ca2+currents and transients were observed, and the transient was little affected when the current was blocked by Cd2+ and La3+ (gray traces). In contrast, Ca2+ current was small in cells expressing RyR2, and little or no transient was present even when the current was not blocked. The behavior of myotubes expressing chimeraR16 was intermediate between RyR1 and RyR2. Most cells expressing chimeraR16 (8 of 10) had depolarization-induced Ca2+ transients that were reduced in amplitude, but not abolished, by blockade of current with Cd2+ and La3+ (for these 8 cells, the amplitude of the peak transient in the presence of Cd2+ and La3+ was 67.2 ± 8% that of control). Other cells (2 of 10) had much smaller transients that were eliminated by Cd2+ and La3+. A second defining feature of skeletal-type EC coupling is that the amplitude of the Ca2+ transient does not have a voltage dependence mirroring that of the peak Ca2+ current; Ca2+ transient amplitude in skeletal muscle has a sigmoidal rather than a bell-shaped voltage dependence. Fig. 2 Billustrates the voltage dependence of intracellular Ca2+transients for each of the three RyR constructs measured in the standard extracellular solution containing 10 mmCa2+. For RyR1, the transient showed a sigmoidal dependence on voltage, unlike peak Ca2+ currents, which had a U-shaped voltage dependence (Fig. 2 C). This behavior is consistent with skeletal-type EC coupling, which is independent of the entry of extracellular Ca2+ (5Armstrong C.M. Bezanilla F.M. Horowicz P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1972; 267: 605-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). The voltage dependence of the transients for chimeraR16 suggested that they were partially dependent on Ca2+ entry (because they were maximal at about the same potential at which inward current peaked) but that they also contained a component of skeletal-type coupling because the transients were still appreciable at +80 mV (Fig. 2 B, inset) and persisted after addition of Cd2+ and La3+, as described above. Thus, the presence of skeletal sequence in chimeraR16 clearly altered the properties of intracellular Ca2+release, causing it to be partially independent of Ca2+entry. Another indication of the importance of the skeletal sequence in chimeraR16 was that the average amplitude of the peak transient was substantially larger than for RyR2; at +30 mV, the peak Ca2+ transient for cells expressing chimeraR16 averaged 45.0 ± 10.4 fluorescence units (n = 22), which was significantly larger (p < 0.025) than in cells expressing RyR2 (6.6 ± 6.6, n = 10), although significantly smaller (p < 10−8) than for cells expressing RyR1 (312 ± 31.7, n = 29). As a separate assay of the ability of chimeraR16 to participate in skeletal-type EC coupling, we determined whether electrical stimulation could elicit contractions in the absence of Ca2+ entry through α1S. Electrically evoked contractions were observed in almost 80% of dyspedic myotubes expressing RyR1, whereas none were observed in cells expressing RyR2 (Fig.3). Contractions were seen in 3 of 30 cells expressing chimeraR16, consistent with the presence in such cells of Ca2+ transients that were resistant to Cd2+/La3+ (Fig. 2 A). The much higher percentage of Cd2+/La3+-resistant Ca2+ transients in chimeraR16-expressing cells (8 of 10 cells tested) probably represents Ca2+ release fluxes that are too small to elicit contraction in response to a brief stimulus but that are still sufficiently large to produce measurable transients in response to a prolonged depolarization. To determine the ability of chimeraR16 to enhance Ca2+ current via α1S (retrograde signaling) (6Nakai J. Dirksen R.T. Nguyen H.T. Pessah I.N. Beam K.G. Allen P.D. Nature. 1996; 380: 72-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar), we measured Ca2+ current density in dyspedic myotubes expressing RyR1, chimeraR16, or RyR2. As shown in Fig. 2 C, Ca2+current density in myotubes expressing chimeraR16 was much smaller than in cells expressing RyR1 and only a little larger than in cells expressing RyR2, which was previously shown (6Nakai J. Dirksen R.T. Nguyen H.T. Pessah I.N. Beam K.G. Allen P.D. Nature. 1996; 380: 72-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar) not to produce retrograde enhancement of Ca2+ current. On average, the maximal peak Ca2+ current density in cells expressing chimeraR16 was 4.04 ± 0.44 pA/picofarad (n= 33), a value significantly (p < 10−10) smaller than that in cells expressing RyR1 (10.02 ± 0.79 pA/picofarad, n = 35) and not statistically different (p value of 0.287) from that in cells expressing RyR2 (3.11 ± 0.56 pA/picofarad, n = 18). Thus, chimeraR16 appears unable to carry out retrograde signaling to α1S. The experiments described above indicated that the R16 region of RyR1 is sufficient for weak EC coupling. To determine whether this region is necessary for signaling, we constructed chimeraR16-rev, in which RyR2 residues 1637–2118 replaced residues 1645–2154 within RyR1. Thus, chimeraR16-rev lacks the RyR1 sequence (1837–2154) present in chimeraR16 as well adjacent RyR1 sequence region toward the amino terminus. If the sR16 region were necessary for bi-directional signaling, one would expect signaling to be lacking in cells expressing chimeraR16-rev. In fact, both Ca2+transients and Ca2+ currents in dyspedic myotubes expressing chimeraR16-rev were similar to those in cells expressing RyR1 (Fig. 4). Moreover, chimeraR16-rev did not differ from RyR1 in its ability to mediate skeletal-type EC coupling, as indicated by electrically evoked contractions in the absence of Ca2+ entry through α1S. Specifically, 31 of 38 myotubes expressing chimeraR16-rev contracted in response to electrical stimulation, a proportion similar to that for RyR1-expressing myotubes (Fig. 3). Thus, the R16 region is not necessary for skeletal-type EC coupling or retrograde signaling. In this paper, we have identified a region of RyR1 (“sR16,” residues 1837–2168) that interacts with a portion of the α1S II–III loop (“s53,” residues 720–765) in yeast two-hybrid assays. A weaker interaction occurred between the corresponding region of RyR2 (“cR16,” residues 1817–2142) and s53. However, sR16 did not interact either with an upstream portion of the α1S II–III loop (“s31,” residues 666–709) or with the portion of the α1C II–III loop (“c53,” residues 850–897) that corresponds to s53. Expression in dyspedic myotubes of chimeraR16, a chimeric ryanodine receptor in which the cR16 region of RyR2 was replaced by sR16, was used to investigate the functional significance of the yeast interaction. In the absence of Ca2+ entry through α1S, both intracellular Ca2+ transients and depolarization-induced contractions revealed that chimeraR16 can mediate weak skeletal-type EC coupling. These functional results, together with the yeast two-hybrid experiments, are consistent with the idea that physical contact between the sR16 region of RyR1 and the s53 region of α1S may be involved in signaling between these two proteins. To determine whether sR16 is essential for bi-directional signaling, we constructed chimeraR16-rev in which a region of RyR1 that includes sR16 was replaced by RyR2 sequence. ChimeraR16-rev retained almost normal ability to mediate bi-directional signaling. Thus, it is clear that signaling does not depend upon the presence of RyR1 sequence in the D3 domain, which is highly divergent between RyR1 and RyR2 (32Sorrentino V. Volpe P. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1993; 14: 98-103Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar) and is contained in the sR16/cR16 region. The ability of chimeraR16-rev to participate in bi-directional signaling also suggests that the interaction between the s53 and sR16 regions is not the only site of coupling between α1S and RyR1. However, the ability of chimeraR16-rev to behave almost like RyR1 does not imply that there is no functional role for binding between α1S and the sR16 region of RyR1 because the cR16 region of RyR2 may also be able to bind to α1S, as suggested by the yeast two-hybrid experiments (Fig. 1). The yeast two-hybrid results reinforce previous findings with α1S chimeras. First, s31 does not bind in two-hybrid experiments to the regions of RyR1 tested here, consistent with observation that bi-directional signaling does not depend on the presence of skeletal sequence in this region (7Nakai J.

A. 2001; 98: 5892-5897Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Second, s53 binds to sR16, but c53 does not. This is consistent with observations of chimeric α1 channels demonstrating that the s53 region is essential for bi-directional signaling (7Nakai J. Tanabe T. Konno T. Adams B. Beam K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24983-24986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 8Grabner M. Dirksen R.T. Suda N. Beam K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21913-21919Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) and that this signaling is lost when s53 is replaced by c53. Thus, s53 may be one site at which α1S contacts RyR1 (in the R16 region), consistent with a direct allosteric activation mechanism for coupling between α1S and RyR1. It is important to consider limitations of the yeast two-hybrid method, which indicate that a failure of interaction cannot be interpreted to mean that the corresponding protein regions do not interact in vivo. First, our use of segments of RyR1 with only a small amount of overlap might have interrupted an interaction motif. More fundamentally, there is an inherent size limitation of segments that can be explored with the two-hybrid method (about 300 residues). These ∼300 residue segments might have failed to achieve a native conformation or been inappropriately expressed as yeast fusion proteins. For all these reasons, we might have missed interactions between α1S and segments of RyR1 outside of sR16 or may have missed a stronger interaction that was interrupted by separation of sR16 from its flanking regions. Finally, the reactivity in yeast between sR16 and s53 is consistent with but does not prove that these residues contact one another in living cells. However, the physiological results clearly show that both regions are important for the functional interaction between RyR1 and α1S. Additionally, the physiological results show that coupling between RyR1 and α1S cannot depend solely on the sR16 region. A number of observations suggest that multiple segments of the primary sequence of both α1S and RyR1 may be involved in bi-directional signaling. First, Nakai et al. (9Nakai J. Sekiguchi N. Tando T. Allen P. Beam K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13403-13406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) found that two different RyR chimeras were able to support signaling interactions between α1S and RyR1. These chimeras contained nonoverlapping RyR1 sequence (residues 1635–2636 or 2659–3720) in a background of RyR2. Second, we have shown here that chimeraR16 supports weak signaling and that stronger signaling is supported by chimeraR16-rev, suggesting that regions of RyR1 in addition to sR16 contribute to signaling. Third, biochemical experiments have shown effects on RyR1 function by peptides corresponding both to the II–III loop (12Lu X., Xu, L. Meissner G. J. Biol.

Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: C1475-C1481Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) of α1S. Moreover, relatively strong binding interactions have been found between the α1S II–III loop and intact RyR1 (34Lu X., Xu, L. Meissner G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18459-18464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) as well as between both the I–II and II–III loops of α1S and a fusion protein corresponding to RyR1 residues 951–1112 (10Leong P.

Interestingly, these latter experiments failed to reveal binding of the α1S II–III loop to sR16-containing fusion peptides. Perhaps this binding is so weak that it can be detected only with the yeast two-hybrid technique, which is more sensitive than more standard binding assays. The explanation is less obvious, however, for why the yeast two-hybrid analysis has failed to reveal the strong binding interactions found in the biochemical experiments. In particular, no strong interactions were observed either in the present work or in earlier yeast two-hybrid experiments in which a skeletal muscle cDNA library was screened with the amino-terminal, I–II, II–III, or III–IV loops of α1S (35Proenza C.

This may result from a distinct disadvantage of the yeast two-hybrid system, that the size of test fragments is limited to a maximum of about 300 residues and that smaller test fragments appear to reconstitute activity of the GAL4 transcription factor more efficiently than do larger fragments (35Proenza C. Wilkens C. Lorenzon N.M. Beam K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23169-23174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), which is particularly problematic for studies of a protein as large as the RyR. Because it is not possible to screen larger regions of primary sequence for interaction using the two-hybrid system, interaction domains consisting of noncontiguous primary sequence could be missed using the two-hybrid approach. Nonetheless, the method has provided the first identification of a domain that may participate in both direct interaction and functional coupling. Currently, a scarcity of information about how the primary sequence of RyRs is arranged in three dimensions hampers both the functional analyses of RyR chimeras and the biochemical analyses of potential interactions between α1S and RyR1. For example, we do not know whether either the sR16 region or the region identified by Leong and MacLennan (10Leong P. MacLennan D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7791-7794Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) (residues 951–1112) is exposed to the cytoplasmic surface of RyR1 that abuts transverse tubules. Obviously, a demonstration that α1S binds to a segment of RyR1 is unlikely to be physiologically significant if that segment is not accessible to α1S in vivo. Just as importantly, we do not know whether the primary sequence of sR16 (for example) contributes to one or several structural domains of the RyR1, a major limitation in interpreting the functional behavior of the R16 chimera. It is also possible that sR16 is just one part of a larger domain involved in interaction with α1S. However, even though it is not currently possible to produce RyR chimeras on the basis of a known relationship between primary sequence and three-dimensional structure, the chimeras remain a valuable tool for testing the functional importance of interactions between α1S and RyR1 that have been identified in vitro.

In the present study performed in HEK-293 cells, we demonstrated that different topological domains of PTHR are implicated in agonist-dependent receptor internalization; truncation of the cytoplasmic tail (PTHR-TR), selective mutations of the cytoplasmic tail to remove the sites of parathyroid hormone (PTH)-stimulated phosphorylation (PTHR-PD), and mutations in the third transmembrane helix (N289A) or in the third cytoplasmic loop (K382A) resulted in a 30–60% reduction in 125I-PTH-related protein internalization. To better define the role of these internalization determinants, we have tested the ability of these mutant PTHRs to associate with β-arrestins by using three different methodological approaches: 1) ability of overexpression of β-arrestins to restore the internalization of125I-PTH-related protein for the mutant PTHRs; 2) visualization of PTH-mediated trafficking of β-arrestin1 and -2 fused to the green fluorescent protein with receptors by confocal microscopy; 3) quantification of β-arrestin1-green fluorescent protein translocation by Western blot. Our data reveal that the receptor' cytoplasmic tail contains determinants of β-arrestin interaction that are distinct from the phosphorylation sites and are sufficient for transient association of β-arrestin2, but stable association requires receptor phosphorylation. Determinants in the receptor's core (Asn-289 and Lys-382) appear to regulate internalization of the receptor/β-arrestin complex toward early endocytic endosomes during the initial step of endocytosis. β-Arrestins have been implicated in regulating internalization of the parathyroid hormone receptor (PTHR), but the structural features in the receptor required for this effect are unknown.

The model developed from studies of the β2-adrenergic receptor views internalization as a process facilitated by binding of β-arrestin proteins to agonist-activated receptors after phosphorylation of the receptors by G protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRKs) (1Gurevich V.V. Dion S.B. Onorato J.J. Ptasienski J. Kim C.M. Sterne-Marr R. Hosey M.M. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 720-731Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar, 2Pippig S.

Binding of β-arrestins to GRK-phosphorylated receptors results in the physical uncoupling of receptors from their cognate G proteins and terminates agonist-mediated signaling (3Krupnick J.G.

It was shown recently that β-arrestins bind clathrin, a major component of the clathrin-based endocytic machinery, with high affinity and serve as an adaptor that targets activated and phosphorylated receptors to clathrin-coated pits (5Krupnick J.G.

In the case of the β2-adrenergic receptor, receptor internalization is the consequence of the formation of a complex between β-arrestin2, the clathrin adaptor protein AP2, clathrin, and the activated receptor (8Laporte S.A. Oakley R.H. Zhang J. Holt J.A. Ferguson S.S.G. Caron M.G. Barak L.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3712-3717Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar). Internalization has at least two outcomes: directing the receptor to a compartment where the phosphates are removed, allowing resensitization, and movement of the receptor to lysosomes for degradation (2Pippig S.

Little is known about the structural determinants of GPCRs involved in receptor internalization and/or in arrestin interaction. The current model for the understanding of the arrestin-receptor interaction mechanism is based on various studies of visual arrestin interaction with rhodopsin (11Scheicher A. Kuhn H. Hofmann K.P.

Visual arrestin binding with rhodopsin requires GRK-1 phosphorylated residues, and the contact of phosphorylated residues with a cationic region of arrestin switches it into an active conformation, enabling interaction with an exposed binding site on activated rhodopsin. The receptor for parathyroid hormone (PTH) and PTH-related protein (PTHrP) is involved in the regulation of calcium homeostasis and in bone remodeling (17Gardella T.J. Jüppner H. Rev. Endocrinol. Metab. 2000; 1: 317-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Agonist occupancy of the PTH/PTHrP receptor (PTHR) leads to activation of adenylyl cyclase (via Gs), and phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase Cβ (via Gq). PTH-induced activation of the PTHR results in the internalization of the PTH-receptor complex via the clathrin-coated pit pathway and involves β-arrestin2 (18Ferrari S.L. Behar V. Chorev M. Rosenblatt M. Bisello A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29968-29975Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 19Ferrari S.L. Bisello A. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 149-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Recently, we have demonstrated that neither the internalization nor the mobilization of β-arrestins (i.e. β-arrestin1 and β-arrestin2) to PTHR required the receptor activation isoform that is necessary for activation of both Gs and Gq proteins (i.e. relative displacement of helix 3 and helix 6 of the receptor; Ref. 20Vilardaga J.-P.

This indicates that G protein activation is not an absolute prerequisite for receptor internalization. In the present study, we investigated the molecular basis of PTHR internalization by examining the interaction of β-arrestins with a series of internalization-deficient receptors. PTH-(1–34) was obtained from Bachem. β-Arrestin2 and β-arrestin1 were fused to the GFP as described (20Vilardaga J.-P. Frank M. Krasel C. Dees C. Nissenson R.A. Lohse M.J. J. Biol.

Puzicka M. Buchen C. Lohse M.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 232: 464-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). PTHR and GFP antibodies were obtained from BAbCO (Richmond, CA) and CLONTECH (Palo Alto, CA), respectively. Expression vectors pCDNA3 and pCEP4 were from Invitrogen (San Diego, CA). Site-directed mutagenesis was performed on the opossum PTH/PTHrP receptor cDNA (23Jüppner H. Abou-Samra A.B. Freeman M. Kong X.F. Schipani E. Richards J. Kolakowski Jr., L.F. Hock J. Potts Jr., J.T.

Constructions of PTHR-PD (phosphorylation-deficient receptor, mutation of serine residues at positions 483, 485, 486, 488, 495, and 498 to alanine residues), PTHR-TR (carboxyl terminus-truncated receptor after the residue 474) and K382A (mutation of Lys-382 to Ala, in the third intracellular loop near helix 5) have been described previously (24Huang Z.

Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 1240-1249PubMed Google Scholar). Construction of N289A (mutation of Asn-289 to Ala, in helix 3) was performed using the transformer site-directed mutagenesis kit (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) based on the method described by Deng and Nickoloff (27Deng W.P. Nickoloff J.A. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 200: 81-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (1079) Google Scholar). Mutations were verified by sequencing. Receptor cDNAs were cloned into pCDNA3 and pCEP4 for transient and stable expression, respectively. Arrestin cDNAs (β-arrestin1, β-arrestin2, β-arrestin1-GFP, and β-arrestin2-GFP) were cloned into pCDNA3. HEK-293 cells (ATCC, CRL 1573) served as the expression system for the wild type and mutant receptors. Cells were maintained in culture at 37 °C under a humidified atmosphere with 7% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal calf serum (Invitrogen). Cells were transfected using a protocol based on the calcium-phosphate method as described previously (28Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1997Google Scholar). Selection of stably transfected cells was initiated 2 days after transfection by the addition of hygromycin (200 μg/ml). Selection was generally complete after 3–4 weeks of hygromycin treatment. Stock cell lines were cultured in the continuous presence of hygromycin, except when subcultured for experiments in which case hygromycin was omitted. To measure phosphorylation of the PTH receptors in intact cells, transiently transfected HEK-293 cells were labeled in six-well plates with 100 μCi/well [32P]orthophosphate in phosphate-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 2 h. Labeled cells were stimulated as indicated, solubilized in 0.8 ml of radioimmune precipitation buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mmEDTA, 50 mm NaF) for 30 min on ice, and the receptors were immunoprecipitated with 10 μg of mouse monoclonal anti-PTHR antibody. Immunoprecipitated proteins were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and PhosphorImager analysis. Transfected cells were grown for 3 days in six-well dishes. After incubation for 1 h at 37 °C with 1 ml of DHB (serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 20 mm HEPES and 0.1% bovine serum albumin), cells were incubated with 0.5 ml of DHB containing 125I-PTHrP-(1–34) (100,000 cpm) at 37 °C for the indicated times. Previous studies have demonstrated that PTH-(1–34) and PTHrP-(1–34) bind equipotently the PTH/PTHrP receptor (23Jüppner H. Abou-Samra A.B. Freeman M. Kong X.F. Schipani E. Richards J. Kolakowski Jr., L.F. Hock J. Potts Jr., J.T. Kronenberg H.M. Segre G.V. Science. 1991; 254: 1024-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (1140) Google Scholar). To stop the incubation, the cells were placed on ice and rapidly washed with 1 ml of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). The cells were incubated for 2 × 5 min in 0.5 ml of acid wash solution (150 mm glycine/50 mm acetic acid, pH = 3) to remove the surface-bound radioligand. The supernatants containing the acid-released radioactivity were collected, and the cells were treated with 1 ml of 0.8 n NaOH to solubilize the acid-resistant radioactivity. The nonspecific binding was measured in parallel experiments using 10−6m PTH-(1–34). The radioactivity was quantified in a γ-counter. The percentage of internalization was calculated after deduction of the respective nonspecific value: % internalization = [(cpm acid-resistant)/(cpm acid-resistant + cpm acid-released)] × 100. The data were fitted to single-phase exponential curves. The endocytic rate constantk e was determined as reported previously (20Vilardaga J.-P. Frank M. Krasel C. Dees C. Nissenson R.A. Lohse M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33435-33443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Ligand binding and cAMP assays were carried out following our previously published procedures (29Vilardaga J.-P. Lin I. Nissenson R.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 1186-1199Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In brief, for binding studies, transfected cells were incubated in DHB buffer for 2 h at 0 °C, followed by a 2-h incubation with the same buffer containing 100,000 cpm 125I-PTH-(1–34) with or without unlabeled PTH-(1–34). Cells were washed twice with iced phosphate-buffered saline and extracted with 0.8 n NaOH, and cell-associated 125I-PTH-(1–34) was counted. Competition curves were fitted to a one-site competitive binding curve. For cAMP assays, cells were washed twice with HEPES buffer and incubated with isobutylmethylxanthine (0.5 mm) in the same buffer for 1 h at room temperature. Cells were stimulated with different PTH-(1–34) concentrations at 37 °C for 10 min. Cellular cAMP was extracted and measured by radioimmunoassay (Immunotech). β-Arrestin translocation was monitored by two assays: confocal scanning microscopy visualization in intact cells and immunoblot analysis. β-Arrestin1 or β-arrestin2 translocation assays were performed in transiently transfected HEK-293 cells. The cells were grown on glass coverslips coated with poly-l-lysine and cotransfected with cDNAs of β-arrestin2 fused to GFP (β-arrestin2-GFP) or β-arrestin1-GFP and PTHR. 48 h after transfection, cells were incubated with 100 nm PTH-(1–34) for different times, and fixed for 20 min in 4% paraformaldehyde. Fixed cells were observed with an oil immersion objective (×40) using a Leica (TCS) confocal laser microscope. Colocalization of β-arrestin2-GFP with rhodamine-labeled wild type or mutant receptors was performed on HEK-293 cells stably expressing the wild type or the mutant PTHR. Cells were grown on glass coverslips and transiently transfected with β-arrestin2-GFP cDNA. After 48 h of transfection, the cells were incubated with 1 μm PTH for different times at 37 °C. Then, the cells were fixed for 20 min in 4% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized using 0.2% Triton. The cells were incubated with mouse OK-1 PTHR antibody at 4 °C overnight. After washing with PBS, the cells were incubated with donkey anti-mouse IgG-rhodamine conjugate secondary antibody at room temperature for 1 h. The cells were mounted on glass slides and examined with a Leica TCS NT/SP confocal microscope. For immunodetection, transiently transfected HEK-293 cells were detached with a rubber policeman and pelleted by low speed centrifugation; the supernatant was discarded and the cells were lysed in PBS containing protease inhibitors (Calbiochem) by sonication. The lysate was centrifuged at 800–1000 × g for 10 min to remove unbroken cells, and the supernatant was further centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 30 min. The resulting supernatant represents the cytosolic fraction and the pellet the membrane fraction. Membrane proteins solubilized in RIPA buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholic acid, 0.1% SDS) supplemented with a protease inhibitor mixture (Calbiochem) and soluble protein fractions of transfected cells coexpressing PTHR and β-arrestin1-GFP or β-arrestin2-GFP were separated on 7.5% SDS-PAGE. Proteins were transferred onto an Immobilon P transfer membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA). Membranes were reacted with anti-β-arrestin1 antibody (1:3000) or anti-GFP (1:5000), and anti-rabbit IgG (1:20,000) coupled to peroxidase, and immunoreactive bands were visualized using chemiluminescence (Pierce). The data were calibrated for similar levels of surface receptors. Concentration/response, competition and internalization kinetics were analyzed by computer-assisted nonlinear regression (GraphPad, San Diego, CA). If not otherwise indicated, all experiments were replicated at least three times in independent experiments, and the results are expressed as mean ± S.E. As shown in Fig.1 A, the PTHR rapidly internalizes in response to agonist when expressed transiently in HEK-293 cells. As monitored by radioligand binding, the maximal extent of internalization was observed after 20 min and represents 55–60% of the cell-specific associated [125I-PTHrP]. The presence of 0.45 m sucrose (an agent that destabilizes clathrin-coated pits; Ref. 30Hansen S.H. Sandvig K. van Deurs B. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 61-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar) reduced the maximal extent of PTHR internalization by 80%. This supports the involvement of clathrin-coated pits in PTH-mediated PTHR internalization (Fig.1 A). Overexpression of β-arrestin2 enhanced the maximal extent of PTHR internalization by 15–20%, whereas overexpression of β-arrestin1 did not significantly increase the magnitude of PTHR internalization (Fig. 1 A). Similar effects were observed after overexpression of functional β-arrestins fused to the green fluorescent protein (i.e. β-arrestin1-GFP or β-arrestin2-GFP, data not shown). Overexpression of β-arrestins did not modify the endocytic rate constant of the PTHR (k e ≈ 0.10 min−1 for both β-arrestin isoforms versus k e = 0.12 ± 0.03 min−1 for PTHR). Confocal scanning microscopy was used to visualize the translocation of β-arrestin1-GFP and β-arrestin2-GFP to the PTHR in response to PTH in transiently transfected HEK-293 cells. Fig. 1 B shows that β-arrestin1-GFP and β-arrestin2-GFP were homogeneously localized in the cytosol of cells expressing the PTHR at the resting state. Within minutes, upon PTH stimulation (100 nm), β-arrestin1-GFP and β-arrestin2-GFP translocated equally well from the cytosol to the cell membrane (Fig. 1 B, 1 min). After longer PTH exposure, β-arrestin1-GFP and β-arrestin2-GFP clusters were present inside the cell (Fig. 1 B, 20 min). The punctated pattern of β-arrestin-GFP fluorescence presumably reflected internalization of PTHR with β-arrestins into endocytic vesicles. These data demonstrated that both β-arrestin isoforms translocate equally well to the activated receptor and show, as do recent studies for β-arrestin2 (18Ferrari S.L. Behar V. Chorev M. Rosenblatt M. Bisello A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29968-29975Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 19Ferrari S.L. Bisello A. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 149-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), the involvement of β-arrestins in PTH-mediated PTHR internalization. We found a series of PTHR mutants with a reduced ability to internalize [125I-PTHrP] when transiently expressed in HEK-293 cells (Fig. 2, A and B). Truncation of the cytoplasmic tail (PTHR-TR) resulted in a severe loss of internalization (50% relative to the wild type PTHR). Mutation of the cytoplasmic tail to remove the sites of PTH-stimulated phosphorylation (PTHR-PD) produced a 30% reduction (relative to the wild type receptor) in PTHR internalization. Two additional mutations in the body of the PTHR, N289A (in the third transmembrane helix) and mutation K382A (in the third cytoplasmic loop), were found to reduce receptor internalization by 60%. Similar internalization deficiency was also observed in HEK-293 cells stably expressing PTHR-TR, N289A, or K382A (data not shown). In contrast, however, PTHR-PD stably expressed in HEK-293 cells internalizes to levels similar to that observed for PTHR in response to agonist (reported previously in Ref. 25Malecz N. Bambino T. Bencsik M. Nissenson R.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1846-1856Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The pharmacological properties of PTHR, PTHR-PD, PTHR-TR, and K382A have been described in our previous studies (24Huang Z. Chen Y. Pratt S. Chen T.-S. Bambino T. Nissenson R.A. Shoback D.M. J. Biol.

N289A displayed a 4-fold decrease in binding affinity and a 2-fold higher EC50 value (Table I).

Basal and maximal PTH-(1–34)-mediated cAMP production were 2–3 and 70–80 pmol/30-mm well (n = 3), respectively. Because agonist-mediated receptor phosphorylation might facilitate PTH-mediated receptor internalization, we examined the relationship between PTH-dependent internalization and phosphorylation of the receptors. As demonstrated previously (25Malecz N. Bambino T. Bencsik M. Nissenson R.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1846-1856Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31Dicker F. Quitterer U. Winstel R. Honold K. Lohse M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 5476-5481Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), PTHR undergoes a PTH-dependent ≈3-fold increase in phosphorylation, and then runs as a broad band at approximately 85 kDa on an autoradiograph (data not shown). Truncation of the tail (PTHR-TR) or mutation of certain Ser residues in the tail (as in PTHR-PD) abolished PTH-promoted receptor phosphorylation. In contrast, the mutant N289A and the signaling-impaired receptor K382A maintained intact phosphorylation characteristics (Fig. 3). These results show that the absence of phosphorylation in PTHR-TR and PTHR-PD may be responsible for the internalization defect. However, our data for N289A and K382A indicate that the decrease of PTH-mediated internalization can occur even when there is no reduction in receptor phosphorylation. Thus, additional mechanisms must regulate PTHR internalization. Given that β-arrestins are involved in the process of PTHR internalization, we next assessed if the diverse mutations reduce PTHR internalization through a β-arrestin-dependent mechanism. We reasoned that overexpression of β-arrestins with the internalization-deficient receptors might compensate for a possible decrease in receptor affinity for β-arrestins. We coexpressed β-arrestin2 or β-arrestin1 with the different mutants in transiently transfected HEK-293 cells and tested by a radioligand assay the specific agonist-mediated internalization of the wild type and mutant receptors. Fig.4 shows that overexpression of β-arrestin2 restored the internalization defect of the phosphorylation-deficient and the truncated PTHRs to 80–85% of that seen with the wild type PTHR in presence of overexpressed β-arrestin2. As observed for β-arrestin2, overexpression of β-arrestin1 ameliorated the internalization extent of PTHR-TR (to 75% of the wild type PTHR+β-arrestin1) but was less able to increase the internalization defect of PTHR-PD. In contrast to the cytoplasmic tail mutants, β-arrestin1 and β-arrestin2 were much less effective in promoting internalization of N289A and K382A mutant receptors; β-arrestin2 or β-arrestin1 only weakly rescued the internalization of these receptors (40–45% of wild type PTHR+β-arrestins). Kinetic analysis of receptor internalization was performed in the absence or presence of exogenous β-arrestin2. Fig.5 shows that, in the absence of β-arrestin2, the internalization-deficient receptors internalized at a lower rate than wild-type PTHR (k e ≈ 0.06–0.09 min−1 for the mutants versus 0.12 min−1 for the wild-type receptor). Coexpression of β-arrestin2 had no effect on the internalization rate of N289A and K382A (k e = 0.060 ± 0.004 min−1 and 0.080 ± 0.004 min−1, respectively), but resulted in a significant increase in the internalization rate constant of PTHR-TR and PTHR-PD (k e in min−1 for PTHR-TR = 0.17 ± 0.01 and for PTHR-PD = 0.12 ± 0.03). These results demonstrated the existence of two classes of receptor mutants. Class 1 mutants (the cytoplasmic tail mutants: PTHR-TR and PTHR-PD) are those where overexpression of β-arrestins can partially rescue agonist-mediated internalization; class 2 mutants (N289A and K382A) are those where overexpression of β-arrestins was not or poorly effective in the amelioration of PTHR internalization. The absence of phosphorylation in the class 1 mutants could reduce the affinity of the PTHR for β-arrestins, and overexpression of β-arrestins might therefore partially compensate for the decrease in receptor affinity for arrestin. The reduced ability of exogenous β-arrestins to restore internalization of class 2 mutants might be the consequence of a weak (or absent) PTH-induced β-arrestin association. Alternatively, the absence of sensitivity to overexpressed β-arrestins might reflect a defect in the internalization process of N289A and K382A that is independent of β-arrestin. To examine more directly the association of β-arrestin2, wild type, and mutant receptors, we visualized by confocal scanning microscopy the trafficking of β-arrestin2-GFP in response to PTH in HEK-293 cells stably expressing the receptors. For these experiments, receptors were labeled with the rhodamine-conjugated anti-PTHR mouse monoclonal antibody and the colocalization between the receptor and the transiently expressed β-arrestin2-GFP was visualized by merging the green and red fluorescence, resulting in a yellow signal.

Because kininogen molecules may be displayed on cell surfaces by binding to glycosaminoglycans, we examined whether the ability of cruzipain to release kinins from high molecular weight kininogen (HK) is modulated by heparan sulfate (HS). Kinetic assays show that HS reduces the cysteine proteinase inhibitory activity (K i app) of HK about 10-fold. Conversely, the catalytic efficiency of cruzipain on kinin-related synthetic fluorogenic substrates is enhanced up to 6-fold in the presence of HS. Analysis of the HK breakdown products generated by cruzipain indicated that HS changes the pattern of HK cleavage products. Direct measurements of bradykinin demonstrated an up to 35-fold increase in cruzipain-mediated kinin liberation in the presence of HS. Similarly, kinin release by living trypomastigotes increased up to 10-fold in the presence of HS. These studies suggest that the efficiency of T. cruzi to initiate kinin release is potently enhanced by the mutual interactions between cruzipain, HK, and heparan sulfate proteoglycans.

The plasma kallikrein-kinin system is a paradigm of a tightly controlled pro-inflammatory proteolytic cascade activated by vascular injury (1Bhoola K.D. Figueroa C.D. Worthy K. Pharmacol. Rev. 1992; 44: 1-80PubMed Google Scholar). Vasoactive peptides structurally related to bradykinin (generally termed as “kinins”) are derived from enzymatic excision from an internal segment (D4 domain) of kininogens. These peptides are implicated in a broad range of pathophysiological responses,e.g. edema formation, vasodilatation, and pain.

Once liberated, kinins activate local endothelial or smooth muscle cells through the constitutively expressed B2 kinin receptor (4Farmer S.G. Burch R.M. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol.

The effect of kinin stimulation on its receptor(s) is tightly regulated by the action of kinin-degrading peptidases (kininases), such as the angiotensin-converting enzyme and neutral endopeptidase (1Bhoola K.D.

Recent efforts to define the structural basis of HK interaction with endothelial cells have focused on two binding sites. One site is represented by 27 amino acids located in the D3 domain (8Herwald H. Hasan A.K. Godovac-Zimmermann J. Schmaier A.H. Müller-Esterl W. J. Biol.

The second binding site, located in the D5H domain of HK, is a highly basic region formed by clusters of histidine, lysine, and glycine (9Hasan A.A.K. Cines D.B. Herwald H. Schmaier A.H.

These studies indicate that the kinin releasing efficiency of living trypomastigotes is dramatically enhanced by heparan sulfate through its interactions with HK and cruzipain. Natural cruzipain (n-cruzipain) was isolated from crude aqueous extracts of Dm28c epimastigotes as described (28Lima A.P.C.A. Scharfstein J. Storer A.C. Ménard R. Mol. Biochem.

These recombinant proteases differ from their natural enzymes by: (i) having a truncated C terminus where residues 216–346 are deleted; (ii) glycosylation in yeast (r-cruzipain 2); and (iii) lack of glycosylation in E. coli(r-cruzipain 1). Purified HK was obtained from human plasma as described previously (9Hasan A.A.K. Cines D.B. Herwald H. Schmaier A.H. Müller-Esterl N. J. Biol.

Antiserum to the light chain of HK was raised in goats and adsorbed with total kininogen-deficient plasma and purified LK (30Schmaier A.H. Zuckerberg A. Silverman C. Kuchibhotla J. Tuszynski G.P.

HK (160 nm) was incubated with different concentrations of n-cruzipain (8, 16, 32, and 64 nm) in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.5, 5 mm EDTA, 200 mm NaCl, 2.5 mmDTT for 1 h at 37 °C. In some experiments, the reactions were performed in the presence of 30 μm of HS, which was added to the HK solution 5 min prior to the addition of cruzipain. The reactions were stopped by the addition of SDS-PAGE sample buffer consisting of 200 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 4% SDS, 10% 2-mercaptoethanol, 20% glycerol, 0.025% bromphenol blue (1:1 v/v) followed by boiling for 5 min. The samples were subjected to 9% SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, blocked with 9% nonfat dried milk in 10 mm Na2HPO4, pH 7.2, 150 mm NaCl (phosphate-buffered saline) containing 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20, and incubated with the primary antibody at a 1:1000 dilution in blocking buffer for 1 h at room temperature. After washing, the appropriate secondary antibodies were incubated, and the reactive bands were visualized upon the addition of 1.4 mm 3, 3′-diamino-benzidine (Sigma), 0.03% H2O2 in phosphate-buffered saline. The concentration of purified HK was determined by titration with papain (Sigma) that had been previously active site-titrated with E-64 (Sigma). Variable amounts of HK were incubated with 0.4 nm of papain in 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.5, 200 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 2.5 mm DTT for 15 min at room temperature. The residual papain activity was detected by the hydrolysis of 10 μm of CBZ-FR-AMC (Sigma) in the same buffer containing 5% Me2SO for substrate solubility. Substrate hydrolysis was monitored in a F-4500 Hitachi spectrofluorometer at 380 nm excitation and 440 nm emission. The initial velocities were determined by linear regression of the substrate hydrolysis curves. The equation obtained from the linear regression of the plot V 0 × volume of HK was used to calculate the corresponding amount of HK (x) to which V 0 equals 0 (y), and the concentration of the stock HK was then calculated accordingly.

The samples were deproteinized with 20% trichloroacetic acid, and the kinin concentrations were estimated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, using a standard curve prepared with synthetic bradykinin provided by the supplier. The values represent the means ± S.D. of three independent experiments. The kinin releasing activity of tissue culture trypomastigotes was measured by incubating the parasites (5 × 106 cells) with 15 nmHK in 200 μl of Ham's F-12 medium, 12.5 mm HEPES, pH 6.5, containing 25 μm captopril, and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin in the presence or absence of different HS concentrations for 1 h at 37 °C. The involvement of cysteine proteases in the kinin releasing activity of the parasites was examined by preincubating the cells with medium supplemented with 100 μm E-64. The parasites were centrifuged at 3000 × g for 10 min, and the supernatants were filtered through 0.2-μm Millipore filters and subsequently deproteinized as described above. The assays were carried out in duplicate. The values represent the means ± S.D. Because the catalytic efficiency of some papain-like proteases is modulated by GAGs (25Li Z. Hou W.S. Bromme D.

The effects of HS on the kinetic properties of cruzipain purified from epimastigote extracts (n-cruzipain) were compared with those from two genetically engineered isoforms, r-cruzipain 1 (cruzain) and r-cruzipain 2 (24Eakin A.E.

Using a short dipeptidyl synthetic substrate,e.g. Z-Phe-Arg-MCA, HS reducedk cat values of n-cruzipain without inducing significant differences in the K m (data not shown). The kinetic parameters of hydrolysis for each protease were then determined using a longer kinin-like fluorogenic substrate, Abz-LGMISLMKRPQ-EDDnp, which spans the N-terminal flanking site of bradykinin. In the presence of HS, there is a significant alteration in the kinetic parameters of n-cruzipain for the hydrolysis of the kinin-like substrate (Fig. 1). These data are consistent with that reported for papain (26Almeida P.C. Nantes I.L. Rizzi C.C.A. Júdice W.A.S. Chagas J.R. Juliano L. Nader H.B. Tersariol I.L.S. J. Biol.

Carmona E. Juliano L. Nader H.B. Tersariol I.L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 944-951Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). The k cat value of n-cruzipain for the hydrolysis of Abz-LGMISLMKRPQ-EDDnp increased significantly as a function of the HS concentration (Fig. 1 A). HS also caused a marked increase in the enzyme affinity for this substrate, evidenced by the decrease in the K m value (Fig.1 B). The effect of HS on the activity of n-cruzipain is described by a hyperbolic mixed type inhibition (Equation 1 under “Experimental Procedures”). The efficiency of hydrolysis of the synthetic substrate was estimated by changing eitherK m (parameter α) or k cat(parameter β). These data were fitted to Equation 1 using nonlinear regression, and the values for the constants were determined (TableI). These studies showed that HS bound free n-cruzipain (E) with a dissociation constant ofK H = 25 ± 1 μm, whereas the parameters obtained for the binding to enzyme-substrate complex was αK H = 11 ± 1 μm. The interaction of HS with n-cruzipain resulted in a 2.59-fold increase in the k cat of the enzyme (β = 2.59 ± 0.05) and also increased the affinity of the enzyme for the kinin-like synthetic substrate (α = 0.446 ± 0.006), resulting in an almost 6-fold increase in its catalytic activity (β/α). HS also increased the catalytic efficiency of r-cruzipain 1 (β/α = 3.0); however, it was at the expense of higherk cat (β) values, because it did not alter the affinity of the enzyme for the kinin-like substrate (dissociation constant α = 1). There also was a modest increase on thek cat (β = 1.5 ± 0.2) of r-cruzipain-2, but this value was too low to permit a precise estimation of the dissociation constant between this isoenzyme and HS.Table IInfluence of heparan sulfate on the kinetic parameters of hydrolysis of Abz-LGMISLMKRPQ-EDDnp by natural and recombinant cruzipain isoformsProteinaseK HαK HK SαK Sk catβk catβ/αμmμmμmμms−1s−1n-cruzipain25 ± 111 ± 10.12 ± 0.010.054 ± 0.0011.5 ± 0.13.9 ± 0.25.8r-cruzipain 115 ± 115 ± 10.80 ± 0.090.82 ± 0.080.40 ± 0.011.2 ± 0.23.0r-cruzipain 2NDND0.11 ± 0.010.10 ± 0.010.50 ± 0.060.75 ± 0.091.5K S is the substrate dissociation constant;K H is the apparent HS dissociation constant; α is the parameter of K S perturbation in presence of heparan sulfate; and β is the parameter of k catperturbation.

Fritz H. Grubb A. Isemura S. Järvinen M. Katunuma N. Machleidt W. Müller-Esterl W. Sasaki M. Turk V. Biochem. J. 1986; 236: 312Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar) that exert potent inhibitory activity toward calpain (33Schmaier A.H. Bradford H. Silver L.D. Farber A. Scott C.F. Schutsky D. Colman R.W. J. Clin. Invest. 1986; 77: 1565-1573Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) and papain-like enzymes, such as cruzipain itself (34Stoka V. Nycander M. Lenarcic B. Labriola C. Cazzulo J.J. Björk I. Turk V. FEBS Lett. 1995; 370: 101-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Kinetic analysis in the presence of HS revealed that this GAG interfered with the cysteine-protease inhibitory capacity of HK. The apparent inhibition constants of HK over n-cruzipain were determined in the presence or absence of 100 μm of HS. The inhibitory activity of HK (K i app = 0.007 nm) decreased about 10-fold in the presence of HS (K i app = 0.07 nm). These results suggested that the HS interaction with HK and/or n-cruzipain significantly reduced the binding affinity of the cystatin-like domains of HK for the parasite proteinase. Because HS impaired the cysteine protease inhibitory activity of HK and enhanced the catalytic activity of n-cruzipain in assays performed with a kinin-like synthetic substrate, we examined whether this GAG changed the proteolysis of HK by n-cruzipain. Assays performed at variable molar ratios of HK/cruzipain ranging from 20:1 to 2:1 were performed in the absence or presence of a molar excess of HS (30 μm), and the HK breakdown products were characterized by immunoblotting and N-terminal sequencing of the cleavage fragments. Heavy chain fragments were defined by using a monoclonal antibody (HKH4) directed to the N-terminal D1 domain of HK. The assays performed with this antibody revealed the presence of two major breakdown products, referred to as H67 and H63 (Fig.2 A, lanes 2–4), in reaction mixtures that did not contain HS. Edman degradation of H67 and H63 did not reveal any sequences, indicating that these heavy chain fragments contain an intact N terminus, which is blocked in the native HK by a pyro-Glu residue (35Kellermann J. Lottspeich F. Henschen A. Müller-Esterl W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1986; 154: 471-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Unlike H67, the smaller fragment H63 was not detected by MBK3, an antibody to the bradykinin epitope; consistent with this result, H63 co-migrates with the kinin-free heavy chain fragment (∼63 kDa) of HK generated by tissue kallikrein (data not shown). The presence of HS almost completely prevented the formation of H67 in assays performed with relatively low concentrations of n-cruzipain, whereas the H63 form was abundant (Fig. 2 A,lanes 6–8). These results indicate that HS redirects cruzipain to more N-terminally located cleavage site(s). Next we did N-terminal sequencing of the breakdown products identified by the anti-light chain antibodies (Fig. 2 B). L55 and L51, the two major fragments detected polyclonal antibodies directed to the light chain of HK, displayed the sequences NAEVY and APAQ, respectively, at their N terminus (Fig. 2 B). This indicates that L55 and L51 are generated by n-cruzipain cleavage of sites that are located at the N-terminal and C-terminal flanking regions of the kinin domain D4 (see Fig. 3 for schematic representation). In the absence of HS, L51 is the major light chain product of HK released by n-cruzipain (Fig. 2 B, lanes 2–4), whereas L55 is the principal fragment formed in the presence of the GAG (Fig.2 B, lanes 6 and 7); these data are consistent with the corresponding pattern of the heavy chain fragments,i.e. H67 (−HS) and H63 (+HS). Because HS binds to the histidine-rich region of D5H (11Renné T. Dedio J. David G. Müller-Esterl W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33688-33696Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), the data suggested that this interaction prevented access of the parasite protease to an otherwise susceptible cleavage site on HK, thereby precluding the formation of L51. The finding that H67, the heavy chain fragment complementary to L51, was not generated in appreciable amounts in the presence of HS (Fig. 2 A, lanes 6–8) further suggests that the GAG protects the cleavage site in D"

By transcript analysis, expression of At2-MMP was found in leaves and roots of juvenile Arabidopsis and leaves, roots, and inflorescences of mature flowering plants showing strong increase of transcript abundance with aging. Cell specificity of expression of At2-MMP was studied by in situ hybridizations in leaves and flowers of Arabidopsis. In leaves, the gene was expressed in the phloem, in developing xylem elements, epidermal cells, and neighboring mesophyll cell layers. In flowers, signals were localized in pistils, ovules, and receptacles. In anArabidopsis mutant (at2-mmp-1) carrying a tDNA insertion in At2-MMP, neither germination nor development of plants was modified in comparison to the wild type in the juvenile rosette stage. Starting with the onset of shoots, growth of roots, leaves, and shoots was inhibited compared with the wild type, and the plants were characterized by late flowering. Besides the flowering, at2-mmp-1 plants showed fast degradation of chlorophyll in leaves and early senescence. These results demonstrate the involvement of At2-MMP in plant growth, morphogenesis, and development with particular relevance for flowering and senescence.

The family of zinc-dependent endopeptidases that has been particularly characterized in vertebrates is divided into four subfamilies based on structural and functional characteristics: matrix metalloproteinases (matrixins), adamalysins, serralysins, and astacins. All members of these zinc metalloproteinases have a similar structure with the conserved consensus sequence HEXXHXXGXXH in their catalytic site and a conserved methionine residue that forms the “Met-turn” structure (1Stocker W. Bode W. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1995; 5: 383-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Members of the subfamily of matrix metalloproteinases are gelatinases, collagenases, and stromelysins (2Borkakoti N. J. Mol. Med. 2000; 78: 261-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Matrix metalloproteinases are synthesized as prepro-enzymes with a signaling peptide targeting the enzyme to the extracellular space. The pre-domain is followed by a pro-peptide with a conserved PRCG(V/N)PD motif that contains the so-called “cysteine switch.” This Cys residue ligates the catalytic zinc thus maintaining the latency of the inactive pro-enzymes (3Nagase H. Woessner J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21491-21494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3903) Google Scholar). In vitro, pro-matrix metalloproteinases can be activated proteolytically by proteinases as well as by mercurial compounds and reactive oxygen, for example, whereas in vivoactivation by proteinases is most likely (3Nagase H. Woessner J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21491-21494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3903) Google Scholar). The function of matrix metalloproteinases is the degradation and remodeling of the extracellular matrix (2Borkakoti N. J. Mol. Med. 2000; 78: 261-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The enzymes play a role in development, embryogenesis, and organ morphogenesis but also in wound healing in vertebrates (4Brew K. Dinakarpandian D. Nagase H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1477: 267-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (1610) Google Scholar). They also participate in pathological processes such as cancer and arthritis (5Wang Y. Johnson A.R., Ye, Q.Z. Dyer R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33043-33049Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). In vertebrates, the enzyme activity of matrix metalloproteinases is transcriptionally regulated as well by proteolytic activation of the mature enzyme from the inactive pro-enzyme and by co-secretion with endogenous inhibitors (4Brew K. Dinakarpandian D. Nagase H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1477: 267-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (1610) Google Scholar). In addition to vertebrates, matrix metalloproteinases have also been identified from Caenorhabditis elegans (6Wada K. Sato H. Kinoh H. Kajita M. Yamamoto H. Seiki M. Gene (Amst.). 1998; 211: 57-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), sea urchins (7Lepage T. Gache C.

FEBS Lett. 1997; 404: 283-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). SMEP1 was shown to be expressed in adult leaves but could not be detected in other plant tissues or in young developing leaves (10Pak J.H. Liu C.Y. Huangpu J. Graham J.S.

In cucumber the matrix metalloproteinase Cs1-MMP is expressed in leaves during senescence and may participate in programmed cell death (11Delorme V.G. McCabe P.F. Kim D.J. Leaver C.J. Plant Physiol. 2000; 123: 917-927Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). matrix metalloproteinase reverse transcriptase rapid amplification of cDNA ends In the Arabidopsis thaliana data base five genomic sequences homologous to matrix metalloproteinases were identified (12Maidment J.M. Moore D. Murphy G.P. Murphy G. Clark I.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34706-34710Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Expression of the Arabidopsis enzymes was detected in roots, leaves, stems, and flowers. Proteolytic activity was demonstrated for one of these proteinases, At1-MMP. At1-MMPhydrolyzed both synthetic peptides and myelin basic protein but not gelatin or casein (12Maidment J.M. Moore D. Murphy G.P. Murphy G. Clark I.M. J. Biol.

Here a detailed characterization of tissue specificity and age dependence of expression of the member of Arabidopsis matrix metalloproteinases At2-MMP is presented. For the first time cell specificity of expression of a plant matrix metalloproteinase was studied by in situ hybridizations and by promoter-reporter gene fusion. Finally, an Arabidopsis mutant carrying a tDNA insertion in the At2-MMP locus was identified and used to demonstrate the physiological role of the gene in plant growth and developmental processes, particularly in flowering and senescence. Plants of A. thaliana (Columbia) were grown in a growth chamber with 10 h of light (240 μmol quanta m−2 s−1, 23 °C) and 14 h of darkness (18 °C) with 50% relative humidity. After germination in rock wool soaked with nutrition solution (1.25 mm KNO3, 1.5 mmCa(NO3)2, 0.75 mmMgSO4, 0.5 mm(NH4)H2PO4, 72 μmFe-EDTA micronutrients (see Ref. 13Ostrem J.A. Olson S.W.

For stress treatment, plants were transferred to nutrition solution containing 50 mm NaCl for 24 h, containing 150 μmCdCl2 for 48 h, or were sprayed with 45 μm methyl jasmonate in 0.1% ethanol (14Penninckx I.A.M.A. Thomma B.P.H.J. Buchala A. Metraux J.P. Broekaert W.F. Plant Cell. 1998; 10: 2103-2113Crossref PubMed Scopus (829) Google Scholar) on leaves and inflorescences and exposed for 48 h. Non-stressed plants were grown in parallel and harvested at the same time. Plants used for the experiments were in the rosette stage at the age of 4 weeks or were flowering at the age of 10 weeks. Plants were harvested 5 h after the onset of illumination. The at2-mmp-1 mutant was identified from the seed pool 02_13 (N40060; insert number 02_13_06) obtained from the Nottingham Arabidopsis Center (UK). RNA was isolated by guanidinium isothiocyanate extraction from leaves, roots, and inflorescences fromA. thaliana (15Chomczynski P. Sacci N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63232) Google Scholar). cDNA synthesis was performed with SuperScript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) from each 3 μg of total RNA using oligo(dT) primers. The sequences of the forward and reverse primers used for amplifying the full-length sequences of At2-MMP(GenBankTM accession number AC002062) by PCR were 5′-CCACCATGAGGTTTTGTGTTTTCGGGT-3′ (S1) and 5′-CTACGGTAAGAACCACAAGACCAATCC-3 (S2). For PCR, Advantage2 polymerase mix (CLONTECH) was used, and the sequence was cloned in the vector PCR2.1-TOPO (Invitrogen). For RT-PCR expression studies, the following forward and reverse primers from the coding region of At2-MMP were used: 5′-GTGAGCTTGATGCGCTTA-3′ and 5′-ATCTGCGTCTAGGTGGAA-3′. With this primer combination a 446-bp fragment was amplified. The fragments were cloned in PCR-TOPO II (Invitrogen). For expression studies with the non-coding region of the transcripts, the following forward and reverse primers were used: 5′-AACGATCACGACAGGGAA-3′ and 5′-CACACAAGAACGC GCTAA-3′ that amplify a 482-bp fragment. The PCR settings were 1 cycle 94 °C for 1 min 30 s, 1 min 94 °C, 1 min 55 °C, 2 min 72 °C, and a final extension at 72 °C for 10 min. For the transcripts, cycle numbers in the linear range of amplification were determined and used for the expression analyses by RT-PCR. AT2-MMP was amplified with 35 cycles from tissue of 4-week-old plants and with 30 cycles from 10-week-old plants. For direct comparison of expression in juvenile and flowering plants, 33 cycles were used. In stress experiments At2-MMP transcripts were amplified with 28 cycles from leaf and root tissue and with 30 cycles from inflorescences of 10-week-oldArabidopsis plants, whereas 34 cycles were used for 4-week-old plants. The PCR products from RT-PCR amplifications were separated on 1.7% (w/v) agarose gels and stained with ethidium bromide. Photographic documentation was performed with a gel documentation system (INTAS, Göttingen). Absence of genomic DNA from the cDNA preparations was verified as described previously (16Golldack D. Dietz K.J. Plant Physiol. 2001; 125: 1643-1654Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). For identification of the at2-mmp-1 mutant, the following tDNA-specific primers were used: 5′-GGTGCAGCAAAACCCACACTTTTACTTC-3′ (dSpm11) and 5′-GTTTTGGCCGACACTCCTTACC-3′ (dSpm8) (compare Nottingham Arabidopsis Center, UK, SLAT collection; nasc.nott.ac.uk)). For 3′-RACE amplifications, total RNA was isolated from rosette leaves of 10-week-old at2-mmp-1 plants as described above, and cDNA synthesis was performed with SuperScript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) using a 3′-RACE anchor primer (SMART RACE,CLONTECH). PCR was performed with the primer dSpm8 and the SMART RACE primer mix (CLONTECH). The DNA fragments amplified were cloned into PCR 2.1 (Invitrogen). Sequencing was performed at the sequencing facility of the University Bielefeld. Genomic DNA was extracted as described previously (17Gustinich S. Manfioletti G. del Sal G. Schneider C. BioTechniques. 1991; 11: 298-302PubMed Google Scholar). A 1249-bp genomic DNA fragment upstream of the start methionine for translation was amplified by PCR with Advantage2 Polymerase mix (CLONTECH) with the following primer pair: 5′-CTTTATTTGACTCCGCCACCTTCAGCT-3′ and 5′-GGTGGTTTTCGGATTATAGGTAGCCAC-3′. The amplified DNA fragment was cloned in the vector pBlue-TOPO (Invitrogen) upstream of thelacZ reporter gene. 10-Week-old Arabidopsis plants were transformed with the pAt2-MMP::lacZ constructs by particle bombardment (PDS1000, Bio-Rad). 0.625 μg of plasmid DNA was precipitated on 1.6-μm gold particles for each bombardment according to the protocol of the manufacturer. For the bombardments 1200 pounds/square inch rupture discs were used. After bombardment, the plants were allowed to recover under normal growth conditions for 24 h. Leaves from the bombarded plants were vacuum-infiltrated with 1% glutaraldehyde in Z′ buffer at room temperature for 1 h to inhibit endogenous β-galactosidase activity (18Teeri T.H. Lehvaslaiho H.

Plant Cell. 1992; 4: 17-27PubMed Google Scholar). The leaves were rinsed three times in Z′ buffer and then vacuum-infiltrated with staining solution as described previously (19Kononowicz H. Wang Y.E. Habeck L.L. Gelvin S.B. Plant Cell. 1992; 4: 17-27PubMed Google Scholar) with 0.1% 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl β-d-galactopyranoside (X-gal) at room temperature for 1 h followed by incubation at 37 °C for 14 h. Finally, the leaves were treated with Z′ buffer and incubated with 70 and 100% ethanol to remove chlorophyll. Leaves from plants bombarded with the promoter-less vector pBlue-TOPO did not show β-galactosidase activity. Tissue sections from inflorescences and leaves from 10-week-oldArabidopsis plants were fixed with formaldehyde-acetic acid, dehydrated, and embedded with Paraplast Plus (Fisher) as described previously (20McKhann H.I. Hirsch A.M. Glick B.R. Thompson J.E. Methods in Plant Molecular Biology and Biotechnology. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1993: 179-205Google Scholar). Sections of 10 μm were mounted on poly-l-lysine-coated microscopic slides. PCR-TOPO II (Invitrogen) harboring the 446-bp fragment of At2-MMP were linearized with restriction enzymes. Antisense and sense RNA were synthesized by in vitro transcription with SP6 and T7 RNA polymerase using digoxigenin-UTP (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) as a label. In situ hybridizations were performed as described previously (16Golldack D. Dietz K.J. Plant Physiol. 2001; 125: 1643-1654Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Cross-sections from rosette leaves of 10-week-old wild type Arabidopsis and at2-mmp-1 plants were prepared as described above and stained with toluidine blue. The leaf material used for the tissue sections was taken from the middle of the leaf blades half-way between the main vein and the edge of the leaves. The genomic sequence of the matrix metalloproteinase At2-MMP has recently been identified in theArabidopsis data base by Maidment et al. (12Maidment J.M. Moore D. Murphy G.P. Murphy G. Clark I.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34706-34710Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) under the GenBankTM accession number AC002062 on chromosome 1. The genomic sequence of At2-MMP is intronless and contains an open reading frame of 378 amino acids. The predicted polypeptide shows the prepro-enzyme structure typical for zinc endopeptidases with a signal peptide, a pro-peptide, and a catalytic domain with the signature motif HEXXHXXGXXH and the conserved methionine residue that forms the Met-turn structure (1Stocker W. Bode W. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1995; 5: 383-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). In a converse manner to At4-MMP, but similar to the other matrix metalloproteinase homologues identified in Arabidopsis, At2-MMP contains a non-cleavable C-terminal trans-membrane domain (compare with Ref. 12Maidment J.M.

Analysis using PSORT (psort.ims.u-tokyo.ac.jp) proposed localization of At2-MMP in the plasma membrane. The expression of At2-MMP was studied by RT-PCR amplification in juvenile 4-week-old Arabidopsis plants in the rosette stage and in 10-week-old flowering Arabidopsisplants. A fragment from the coding region of the gene was amplified by gene-specific primers, and actin was amplified as a loading control. In 4-week-old Arabidopsis plants, transcripts of At2-MMP were detected in leaves and roots with a higher transcript abundance in the leaf tissue (Fig.1 A). In 10-week-old floweringA. thaliana plants, At2-MMP was expressed in leaves, roots, and inflorescences. The highest signal strength was obtained from root tissue, and in leaves and flowers a lower level of expression was detected (Fig. 1 B). To analyze developmental effects, the transcript abundance of At2-MMP was compared in leaves and roots of juvenile and flowering Arabidopsis. In both tissue types the expression of the metalloproteinase was strongly induced with aging of the plants (Fig. 1 C). The tissue specificity of At2-MMPexpression was studied by histochemical detection of promoter activity in cauline leaves and rosette leaves of 10-week-oldArabidopsis plants. A genomic fragment 5′-upstream of the start methionine of the At2-MMP coding sequence was fused to the β-galactosidase reporter gene, and Arabidopsis plants were transformed biolistically with the promoter-reporter-gene construct. The plants were allowed to recover under normal growth conditions before β-galactosidase activity induced by the At2-MMP promoter was histochemically detected. Reporter-gene expression could be found in both cauline and rosette leaves with signals of similar staining intensity. The signals were distributed on the leaf blade without preference of a particular leaf area (Fig.2 A). For analysis of cell specificity of At2-MMP transcript abundance, in situ hybridizations were performed in leaf and flower cross-sections from 10-week-old Arabidopsis plants using a fragment from the coding region of the gene as a probe. In flowers, signals were detected in the receptacle in the two to three mesophyll layers neighboring the epidermis but was not detectable in sepals and petals. Strong expression of At2-MMP occurred in the gynoecium in the cell layers neighboring the epidermis with signal intensities increasing toward the styles. Furthermore, strong hybridization of antisense-At2-MMP RNA could be observed in ovules (Fig. 2, C–F). In leaves, expression of the matrix metalloproteinase was detected in phloem cells next to the metaxylem and in selected protoxylem cells. Moreover, epidermal cells and mesophyll cell layers toward the leaf surface were showing At2-MMP signals (Fig. 2, G and H). The regulation of At2-MMP transcription in response to methyl jasmonate, to the heavy metal cadmium, and to salt stress was studied by RT-PCR amplification. Methyl jasmonate is known to induce pathogenesis-related and wounding responses in plants (21Creelman R.A. Mullet J.E. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. 1997; 48: 355-381Crossref Scopus (1514) Google Scholar) and was applied to 4- and 10-week-old Arabidopsis plants by spraying of leaves, stems, and inflorescences as a 45 μmsolution. The heavy metal cadmium that is a highly toxic abiotic stressor and inhibits plant growth (22Sandalio L.M. Dalurzo H.C. Gomez M. Romero-Puertas M, C. del Rio L.A. J. Exp. Bot. 2001; 52: 2115-2126Crossref PubMed Scopus (1181) Google Scholar) was added at 150 μm to the nutrition solution for 48 h. For salt stress, the nutrition solution was supplemented with 50 mmNaCl, and the plants were exposed for 24 h. In rosette leaves of 4-week-old Arabidopsis plants, both methyl jasmonate treatment and exposure to cadmium increased the transcript level of At2-MMP, whereas the signal strength did not change in response to NaCl. Conversely, in roots the transcription was stimulated by NaCl but was not modified by jasmonate and cadmium (Fig. 3). In 10-week-old plants, the At2-MMP transcript level in roots was not affected by the three stressors. In leaves and inflorescences the expression was not modified by jasmonate (Fig. 4) and NaCl (not shown) but was strongly inhibited by exposure to cadmium (Fig.4).Figure 4Stress-induced expression of At2-MMP in floweringArabidopsis.

The identified F1 at2-mmp-1 plant was self-pollinated, and from the F2 generation 12 plants homozygous for at2-mmp-1 were PCR-based identified for further characterization. From genomic DNA of the F1 plant a PCR fragment was amplified with the At2-MMP sequence-specific primer S1 and the tDNA-specific primer T2. The amplified DNA fragment was cloned, and sequence analysis revealed the integration of the tDNA into the At2-MMP locus at bp 415 of the open reading frame of At2-MMP. From genomic DNA isolated from the at2-mmp-1 mutant plants, the full-length coding DNA sequence could not be amplified using the S1-S2 primer combination. This difference in obtaining full-length At2-MMP PCR products from wild type genomic DNA but not from at2-mmp-1 plants allowed to distinguish clearly between the wild type and the mutant plants and indicated that the at2-mmp-1 plants analyzed were homozygous for the tDNA insertion without carrying the wild type gene (Fig.5 A). By using the tDNA-specific primer dSpm8, a single PCR product was obtained by 3′-RACE PCR amplifications from cDNA synthesized from RNA of at2-mmp-1 mutant plants (Fig. 5 B). Sequencing of the PCR product revealed its identity as chimeric DNA composed of the 3′-end of the inserted tDNA as well as the 3′-end of the At2-MMP coding region and demonstrated integration of the cDNA up to bp 412 at the 3′-end of the gene (Fig.6). The results from the 3′-RACE experiments show that At2-MMP carrying the tDNA insertion is expressed in at2-mmp-1 plants. Furthermore, obtaining only one PCR-product from the transcript population of at2-mmp-1 plants by using tDNA-specific primers suggests that the mutant plants carry a single tDNA insertion.Figure 6Sequence of the At2-MMPlocus carrying the tDNA insertion. Nucleotide and amino acid sequences of the locus of tDNA insertion in At2-MMP and the tDNA-specific oligonucleotide primers dSpm8 and dSpm11 are shown. Theasterisks indicate the 5′-end and the 3′-end of the tDNA.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) There was no difference of germination time and germination rate observable between wild type plants and the at2-mmp-1 mutants. The development of the second leaf pair was slower in the mutant plants than in the wild type, whereas further development was not modified in comparison to the wild type plants during the juvenile rosette stage. Starting with the development of shoots, growth of at2-mmp-1 plants became significantly slower than that of the wild type (Fig.7). At the age of 6 weeks root length of the mutant was about 60% of the wild type; leaf length was about 70%, and shoot length was about 15%. The development of flowers started 2–3 weeks later in the mutant than in the wild type under the growth conditions used in our experiments. The final length reached by at2-mmp-1 plants was about 80% of the wild type for roots and about 70% for leaves and shoots (Fig.8). At the age of 10 weeks the mutant plants showed fast degradation of chlorophyll and pronounced senescence in both rosette and cauline flowers, whereas wild type plants grown in parallel showed initial signs of senescence in the oldest rosette leaves but no chlorophyll degradation in younger rosette and cauline leaves (Fig. 9). Transverse sections from rosette leaves of 10-week-old wild type Arabidopsis plants and at2-mmp-1 revealed reduced cell size and thus indicated inhibition of elongation in at2-mmp-1 compared with wild type plants (Fig. 10).Figure 8Growth inhibition in at2-mmp-1 plants.

Dinakarpandian D. Nagase H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1477: 267-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (1610) Google Scholar). Degradation of the extracellular matrix has an important role for physiological processes as embryogenesis, organ morphogenesis, and bone remodeling, for example (5Wang Y. Johnson A.R., Ye, Q.Z. Dyer R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33043-33049Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Unregulated enzyme activity of matrix metalloproteinases is involved in the development of diseases including cancer, arthritis, and atherosclerosis (4Brew K. Dinakarpandian D. Nagase H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1477: 267-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (1610) Google Scholar). There are 20 soluble members of matrix metalloproteinases known that are secreted to the extracellular space, and furthermore, there have been 5 membrane-anchored matrix metalloproteinases described that have a predicted localization in the plasma membrane (see Refs. 5Wang Y. Johnson A.R., Ye, Q.Z. Dyer R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33043-33049Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar and 23Quaranta V. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 1167-1170Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar; psort.ims.u-tokyo.ac.jp). In contrast to animals, little is known on the matrix metalloproteinase homologues in plants. In this study At2-MMP was chosen as one of the five matrix metalloproteinases that were recently identified in the Arabidopsis data base (12Maidment J.M. Moore D. Murphy G.P. Murphy G. Clark I.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34706-34710Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) for a detailed analysis of expression and physiological function. Transcript analysis shows expression of At2-MMP in all tissues investigated, i.e. roots, leaves, and inflorescences. In both leaf and root tissue expression of At2-MMP was developmentally controlled with strong induction in mature flowering Arabidopsis. Maidment et al.(12Maidment J.M. Moore D. Murphy G.P. Murphy G. Clark I.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34706-34710Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) studied the expression of five Arabidopsismetalloproteinases in 2-week-old plants and found transcripts in leaves, stems, and flowers with different gene-specific transcript levels. At2-MMP was detected with stronger expression in roots than in flowers and leaves corresponding to the expression pattern that we found in flowering 10-week-old Arabidopsisplants in this study, whereas in juvenile 4-week-old plants At2-MMP transcript abundance was higher in leaves than in roots. In contrast to At2-MMP, Maidment et al.(12Maidment J.M. Moore D. Murphy G.P. Murphy G. Clark I.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34706-34710Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) found expression of At5-MMP to be strongest in stems and At3-MMP had higher transcript abundance in leaves and roots than in flowers and stems. In a converse manner, the matrix metalloproteinase SMEP1 from soybean was only detected in leaf tissue starting at the age of 10 days. Expression increased up to the age of 20 days and increased slightly thereafter. The enzyme was neither expressed in young leaves nor in other tissues both on the transcript and on the protein level in soybean (10Pak J.H. Liu C.Y. Huangpu J. Graham J.S. FEBS Lett. 1997; 404: 283-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In cucumber, the matrix metalloproteinase Cs1-MMP was detected in leaves during senescence with chlorophyll degradation already occurring. Cs1-MMP was also found to be expressed in senescing male cucumber flowers (11Delorme V.G. McCabe P.F. Kim D.J. Leaver C.J. Plant Physiol. 2000; 123: 917-927Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The data shown in cucumber (11Delorme V.G. McCabe P.F. Kim D.J. Leaver C.J. Plant Physiol. 2000; 123: 917-927Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), soybean (9Graham J.S. Xiong J. Gillikin J.W. Plant Physiol. 1991; 97: 786-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 10Pak J.H. Liu C.Y. Huangpu J. Graham J.S. FEBS Lett. 1997; 404: 283-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), and Arabidopsisplants as presented in this study suggested that the metalloproteinase expression has a physiological role in mature aging tissue and might be involved in plant senescence. In this study we analyzed the cell specificity of At2-MMPexpression in leaves and flowers of 10-week-old Arabidopsisplants by in situ hybridizations. Transcription of the metalloproteinase was detectable in several cell types such as phloem and developing xylem cells and mesophyll and epidermal cells. Interestingly, in leaves as well as in the pistils and the stems of the flowers, signal intensities of At2-MMP increased toward the epidermal cell layers. Strong expression of the enzyme could also be found in ovules. Based on this cell specificity with main transcription in epidermal and neighboring cells, involvement of At2-MMP in embryogenesis and morphogenesis analogous to animal systems seemed likely. This conclusion was supported by the decreased size of leaf cells, and particularly of epidermal cells, in the knock-out mutant. Although no natural substrates of plant matrix metalloproteinases have been identified yet, these enzymes cleave similar substrates as animal metalloproteinases when tested in vitro. Enzyme activity of soybean SMEP1 was shown for fluorogenic and chromogenic peptide substrates that are also cleavable by human fibroblast collagenase (24McGeehan G. Burkhart W. Anderegg R. Becherer J.D. Gillikin J.W. Graham J.S. Plant Physiol. 1992; 99: 1179-1183Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Cs1-MMP from cucumber showed collagenase activity when synthetic peptides and type I collagen were used as substrates (11Delorme V.G. McCabe P.F. Kim D.J. Leaver C.J. Plant Physiol. 2000; 123: 917-927Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Maidment et al. (12Maidment J.M. Moore D. Murphy G.P. Murphy G. Clark I.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34706-34710Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) showed that the mature At1-MMP that was heterologously expressed inEscherichia coli cleaved myelin basic protein as well as peptide substrates for metalloproteinases but not gelatin and casein. Besides, the At1-MMP activity was inhibited by TIMP1 and TIMP2 as well as by the metalloproteinase hydroxamate inhibitor BB94 (12Maidment J.M. Moore D. Murphy G.P. Murphy G. Clark I.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34706-34710Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). According to the ability of plant metalloproteinases to cleave similar substrates as the animal enzymes, a role of the plant proteases in defense against pathogens seemed plausible. Thus, metalloproteinases might be involved in proteolysis of foreign proteins in the plant extracellular matrix. In addition, members of the family of the plant subtilisin-like proteases were transcriptionally activated by pathogen attack in tomato (25Tornero P. Conejero V. Vera P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6332-6337Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 26Jorda L. Coego A. Conejero V. Vera P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2360-2365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) and by treatment with methyl jasmonate that mediates wounding and pathogen responses in plants (21Creelman R.A. Mullet J.E. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. 1997; 48: 355-381Crossref Scopus (1514) Google Scholar). In this study we compared the expression of At2-MMP in response to methyl jasmonate, the highly toxic heavy metal cadmium, and NaCl in developing 4-week-old rosette plants and in mature 10-week-old flowering plants at the border to senescence. Our results demonstrated that expression of At2-MMP is not regulated as a general stress response in Arabidopsis but is tightly controlled in a tissue-responsive way with developmental differences. In 4-week-old plants leaf tissue but not roots showed transcriptional activation of the enzyme in response to methyl jasmonate and cadmium, whereas in root tissue expressional up-regulation was observed specifically in response to salt stress. In mature plants presenting the main developmental phase of At2-MMP expression, transcription of the enzyme was inhibited in inflorescences and leaves by cadmium treatment but was not modified by the metal in roots as well as in response to methyl jasmonate and salinity in all tissues tested. According to these data we conclude that At2-MMP plays a minor role in general stress responses in Arabidopsis and is particularly not of significant importance for adaptation to wounding stress or pathogenesis response. The extracellular matrix of plants consists by up to 10% of the dry weight of proteins including enzymes such as hydrolases and peroxidases, pathogenesis-related proteins, signal sensing, and structural proteins (27Dietz K.J. Prog. Bot. 2000; 62: 215-237Crossref Google Scholar). Physiological roles of extracellular proteolytic processes and particularly of matrix metalloproteinases rarely have been investigated in plants but are well documented in animal systems. In mice, knock-out mutants have been generated and characterized for several matrix metalloproteinases. Interestingly, in knock-out mice with defects of soluble MMPs some developmental phenotypes were detected (23Quaranta V. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 1167-1170Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In contrast, knock-out mutants of the membrane-type MT1-MMP were characterized by dwarfism, arthritis, and fibrosis, for example (28Holmbeck K. Bianco P. Caterina J. Yamada S. Kromer M. Kuznetsov S.A. Mankani M. Robey P.G. Poole A.R. Pidoux I. Ward J.M. Birkedal-Hansen H. Cell. 1999; 99: 81-89Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1112) Google Scholar). By overexpression of seven different soluble matrix metalloproteinases, morphogenesis was not affected in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells, whereas three membrane-type MMPs accelerated, disrupted, or modified branching tubulogenesis in these cells (29Hotary K. Allen E. Punturieri A. Yana I. Weiss S.J. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 1309-1323Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). These data demonstrated that in animal systems membrane-type MMPs have a key role in pericellular proteolysis of the extracellular matrix including its remodeling and are essential for development, cell invasion, and morphogenesis (28Holmbeck K. Bianco P. Caterina J. Yamada S. Kromer M. Kuznetsov S.A. Mankani M. Robey P.G. Poole A.R. Pidoux I. Ward J.M. Birkedal-Hansen H. Cell. 1999; 99: 81-89Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1112) Google Scholar, 29Hotary K. Allen E. Punturieri A. Yana I. Weiss S.J. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 1309-1323Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). In the present study, an Arabidopsis mutant of the membrane-type At2-MMP was identified carrying a tDNA insertion. The mutant phenotype showed the involvement of the enzyme in growth and development of maturing plants. Roots as well as leaves, shoots, and inflorescences exhibited growth inhibition and retarded development. Furthermore, the mutant plants were characterized by late onset and slow development of flowers, and their final size was reduced compared with wild type plants. Interestingly, aging of the plants was not slowed down in comparison to the wild type, but the mutation caused acceleration of senescence. Based on expressional studies that revealed Cs1-MMP transcripts only in senescing cucumber leaves, Delorme et al. (11Delorme V.G. McCabe P.F. Kim D.J. Leaver C.J. Plant Physiol. 2000; 123: 917-927Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) suggested an involvement of Cs1-MMP in programmed cell death. The authors hypothesized that the enzyme may contribute to proteolysis of cell residues, for example (11Delorme V.G. McCabe P.F. Kim D.J. Leaver C.J. Plant Physiol. 2000; 123: 917-927Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Our data demonstrate an earlier onset of senescence and cell death in at2-mmp-1 mutants than in wild type plants as well as growth inhibition of organs. Apparently, the activity of At2-MMP is related to a delay of senescence and programmed cell death and is necessary for regular plant growth and development. In general, the physiological functions of extracellular proteolytic processes in plants may include the remodeling of the extracellular matrix during growth and development. Turnover of extracellular matrix proteins could be involved in the generation of secondary cell walls during plant maturation, formation of secondary plasmodesmata, of vascular xylem elements, and intercellular lytic spaces, as well as regulation of receptor interactions and signal transduction by receptor modification. Interestingly, At2-MMP was mainly expressed in mature flowering plants, and phenotypic differences of the at2-mmp-1 mutant from wild type plants were particularly pronounced starting with the plant shooting and onset of flowers. Our data demonstrated that extracellular proteolytic processes mediated by At2-MMP are involved in growth and development during the developmental phase of flowering. However, it is likely that morphogenesis and growth of juvenile plants requires extracellular proteolytic processes as well. Members of other families of extracellular proteases may substitute for the function of matrix metalloproteinases in the juvenile developmental phase of plants. Candidate enzymes are members of extracellular subtilisin-like proteases, for example, that have been shown to be preferentially expressed in young developing plants (30Messdaghi D. Dietz K.-J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1480: 107-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). 2D. Golldack, P. Vera, and K. J. Dietz, non-published results. Future studies on the regulation of age-dependent expression, identification of signal transduction pathways, and in vivo studies will further clarify our understanding on the significance of extracellular proteases for plant morphogenesis and development. Finally, the hypothesis of a more specific function of At2-MMP may be suggested which involves receptor shedding or activation and will have to be tested. Initiation of senescence and programmed cell death involves hormonal stimuli such as ethylene and salicylate (31Johnson P.R. Ecker J.R. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1998; 32: 227-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar, 32Heath M. Plant Mol. Biol. 2000; 44: 321-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (767) Google Scholar); other stimuli such as cytokinins counteract the development of senescence (33Brault M. Maldiney R. Plant Physiol. Biochem. 1999; 37: 403-412Crossref Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The stimuli are sensed by receptors that in turn activate signaling cascades and trigger or silence the senescence program. Assuming the constitutive expression of such a receptor, and either its continuous degradation or specific activation by MMP, MMP-deficient tissue could be hypersensitized leading to inhibited growth and premature activation of the senescence program (34Beers E.P. Woffenden B.J. Zhao C. Plant Mol. Biol. 2000; 44: 399-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). The phenotype of the at2-mmp-1 mutant plants is in agreement with such a hypothesis."

For type I IFNs (α/β) the most abundantly induced GTPases are the members of the Mx family. Although the function of Mx proteins is not fully understood, some have been shown to have antiviral activity (reviewed in Refs. 6Haller O. Frese M. Koch G. Rev. Sci. Tech. Off. Int.

Although induced by IFN-α/β, their induction is much more robust following exposure to IFN-γ (15Cheng Y.S. Becker-Manley M.F. Nguyen T.D. DeGrado W.F. Jonak G.J. J.

In mammals there appear to be two genetically linked genes for GBPs that may have arisen by genetic duplication (18Vestal D.J. Buss J.E. McKercher S.R. Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G. Kelner G.S. Asundi V.K. Maki R.A. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 1998; 18: 977-985Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In mice, there are at least two additional, more distantly related, family members, MAG-2 (19Wynn T.A. Nicolet C.M. Paulnock D.M. J. Immunol. 1991; 147: 4384-4392PubMed Google Scholar) and mGBP-3 (23Han B.H.H. Park D.J. Lim R.W., Im, J.H. Kim H.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1384: 373-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). GBPs have only two easily identifiable motifs, a guanine nucleotide-binding site and, for most GBPs, a CAAXsite for isoprenoid modification.GBPs are unlike other GTPases in that they have only two of the three conserved regions of the standard guanine nucleotide-binding site (24Dever T.E. Glynias M.J. Merrick W.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 1814-1818Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar, 25McCormick F. Clark B.F.C. LaCour T.F.M. Kjeldgaard M. Norskov-Lauritsen L. Nyborg J. Science. 1985; 230: 78-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Consistent with these primary sequence differences, GBPs display a wider range of guanine nucleotide binding and hydrolysis than many other GTPases. All GBPs examined to date hydrolyze GTP to both GDP and GMP (22Schwemmle M. Kaspers B. Irion A. Staeheli P. Schultz U. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10304-10308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 26Schwemmle M. Staeheli P. J. Biol.

Recently, two crystal structures for human GBP-1 (hGBP-1) have been solved, one in the absence of bound nucleotide (28Prakash B. Praefcke G.J.K. Renault L. Wittinghofer A. Herrmann C. Nature. 2000; 403: 567-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar) and the second bound to nonhydrolyzable GTP (29Prakash B. Renault L. Praefcke G.J.K. Herrmann C. Wittinghofer A. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4555-4564Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Based on the biochemical properties and structure, hGBP-1 represents a unique class of GTPases but is suggested to be distantly related to the dynamin family of proteins (30Praefke G.J.K. Geyer M. Schwemmle M. Kalbitzer H.R. Herrmann C. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 292: 321-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 31van der Bliek A.M. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 96-102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). These are large GTPases that share the capacity to oligomerize and have an intrinsic high GTPase activity that shows a concentration dependence (28Prakash B. Praefcke G.J.K. Renault L. Wittinghofer A. Herrmann C. Nature. 2000; 403: 567-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). The IFN-induced Mx proteins are also part of the dynamin family (31van der Bliek A.M. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 96-102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar).Also present on GBPs, except the more distantly related MAG-2 and mGBP-3, is a CAAX amino acid motif at their carboxyl termini that encodes a potential site for isoprenyl lipid modification. Isoprenylation is a multistep process that involves attachment of either a C-15 farnesyl or C-20 geranylgeranyl lipid to the cysteine residue of the CAAX (32Casey P.J. Seabra M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5289-5292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar). Although not all CAAXsequences are utilized in vivo, it has been demonstrated that hGBP-1 (33Nantais D.E. Schwemmle M. Stickney J.T. Vestal D.J. Buss J.E. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1996; 60: 423-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), rat p67 GBP (34Vestal D.J. Buss J.E. Kelner G.S. Maciejewski D. Asundi V.K. Maki R.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 224: 528-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), mGBP-2 (18Vestal D.J. Buss J.E. McKercher S.R. Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G. Kelner G.S. Asundi V.K. Maki R.A. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 1998; 18: 977-985Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), and mGBP-1 (35Stickney J.T. Buss J.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 2191-2200Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) are lipid-modified in vivo. All of these are modified by the C-20 isoprenoid except hGBP-1, which is farnesylated. Interestingly, it would appear that not all GBPs are uniformly prenylated in all cells, as mGBP-1 has recently been shown to be very poorly isoprenylated (35Stickney J.T. Buss J.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 2191-2200Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). We have recently demonstrated that mGBP-2 isoprenylation is necessary for targeting to a population of heterogeneously sized intracellular vesicle-like structures (16Vestal D.J. Gorbacheva V.V. Sen G.C. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 2000; 20: 991-1000Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). mGBP-1 fails to go to these intracellular vesicle-like structures (16Vestal D.J. Gorbacheva V.V. Sen G.C. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 2000; 20: 991-1000Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), possibly as a consequence of incomplete prenylation.By using NIH 3T3 cells as a model system, we examined the functional consequences of expressing the GBP family member mGBP-2 in the absence of other IFN-induced proteins. We report here the first functional studies of murine GBPs that concludes mGBP-2 alters the growth characteristics of murine fibroblasts. Cells constitutively expressing mGBP-2 form foci when allowed to grow to post-confluence. The robustness of this phenotype correlates with the expression level of mGBP-2 and is not observed in cells expressing mGBP-2 with a mutant GTP binding domain. In this mutant mGBP-2, a single amino acid in the P loop has been changed from Ser at position 52 to Asn, a mutation equivalent to the traditional S17N mutation in Ras-like proteins that reduces their relative affinities for GTP (36Feig L.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: E25-E27Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). Cells expressing mGBP-2 also grow at a faster rate and to a higher density. In addition, they have a reduced need for serum-derived growth factors for proliferation. However, these cells fail to grow as colonies in soft agar, suggesting that they have retained anchorage-dependent growth. In addition, they grow as tumors in athymic mice. Whereas IFN-β treatment of NIH 3T3 cells has little effect on cell growth, IFN-γ enhances NIH 3T3 cell proliferation. The magnitude of the IFN-γ-induced reduction in doubling time is comparable with that observed for cells constitutively expressing mGBP-2 in the absence of other IFN-induced proteins. Taken together these data indicate that mGBP-2 functions by contributing to a signaling pathway that controls growth regulation and supports a role for mGBP-2 in IFN-γ-mediated growth regulation. These studies provide information that the highly abundant GBPs can function in regulation of some aspects of growth control by IFNs.DISCUSSIONWe have generated NIH 3T3 cell clones constitutively expressing either the murine IFN-induced GTPase, mGBP-2, or mGBP-2 containing a point mutation in the P loop of the GTP binding domain, S52N mGBP-2. Analysis of these cells indicated that mGBP-2 is capable of altering several parameters of cell growth in the absence of other IFN-induced proteins. First, NIH 3T3 fibroblasts expressing mGBP-2 grew faster and to higher saturation density (Figs. 3 and 7). The extent to which the doubling time of NIH 3T3 cells is shortened by mGBP-2 correlates with its level of expression. Expression of mGBP-2 at levels comparable with those of NIH 3T3 cells treated with IFN-γ for 24 h induced cells to grow about twice as fast as cells without mGBP-2 (Fig. 3). Flow cytometric analysis of the DNA content of these cells shows no difference in the proportion of cells in G1, S, or G2/M compared with control transfectants, suggesting that the different phases of the cell cycle are uniformly shortened by mGBP-2 (Fig. 4). Second, the increased density of cell growth observed in mGBP-2-expressing fibroblasts was accompanied by at least a partial loss of contact growth inhibition, as evidenced by the ability to form foci when grown to post-confluence. Foci formation is correlated with mGBP-2 expression level (Fig. 6). Third, the growth advantage of mGBP-2-expressing cells is not abrogated in reduced serum (Fig. 8). Finally, NIH 3T3 cells expressing mGBP-2 show enhanced tumor-forming ability in athymic mice (Fig. 9).The increased growth rate, partial loss of contact growth inhibition, increased ability to grow in reduced serum, and the ability to form tumors in athymic mice, but retention of substrate-dependent growth, suggest a weak or incomplete form of transformation. This “incomplete” transformation has been observed for other GTPases, most notably members of the Rho family of small GTPases (reviewed in Refs. 47Fort P. Prog. Mol. Subcell. Biol. 1999; 22: 159-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar and 48Mackay D.J.G. Hall A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20685-20688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar). The Rho family of GTPases is involved in a wide variety of cellular processes, such as signal transduction, cytokinesis, cell adhesion, migration, and cell proliferation (48Mackay D.J.G. Hall A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20685-20688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar, 49Bar-Sagi D. Hall A.

Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1415-1438Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). In general, transformation by members of the Rho family is much less robust than observed for Ras and requires the expression of proteins containing activating mutations (51Avraham H. Weinberg R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 2058-2066Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 52Khosravi-Far R. Solski P.A. Clark G.J. Kinch M.S. Der C.J. Mol. Cell.

Biol. 1997; 7: 629-637Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Even then, some Rho family members fail to induce all of these parameters of transformed growth. For example, expression of activated RhoA in NIH 3T3 cells does not result in focus formation or growth in soft agar but does promote reduced dependence on serum and tumorigenesis (47Fort P. Prog. Mol. Subcell. Biol. 1999; 22: 159-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Rho family proteins mediate these phenotypes by interaction with and activation of a wide variety of effector proteins (49Bar-Sagi D. Hall A. Cell. 2000; 103: 227-238Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar, 50Zohn I.M. Campbell S.L. Khosravi-Far R. Rossman K.L. Der C.J. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1415-1438Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). The mechanism(s) by which mGBP-2 mediates similar changes to those observed for activated Rho family members is at this time completely unknown. Certainly, one possibility is that mGBP-2 functions within one of the pathways used to mediate Ras or Rho family-induced cellular changes. Recently, the rat homolog of mGBP-2 was identified as a putative target of Ras transformation, having been identified as a gene robustly induced subsequent to Ras transformation of rat fibroblasts (57Zuber J. Tchernitsa O.I. Hinzmann B. Schmitz A.-C. Grips M. Hellriegel M. Sers C. Rosenthal A. Schafer R. Nat. Genet. 2000; 24: 144-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar).GTP binding and hydrolysis is crucial for many, but not all, functions of GTPases. We have shown for mGBP-2 that wild type GTP binding is required for its growth promoting activity as well as the ability to form foci and grow in reduced serum. For example, the antiviral activity of the IFN-induced protein MxA does not require GTPase activity (58Janzen C. Kochs G. Haller O. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 8202-8206Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar).Although interferons are probably best studied for their antiviral and antiproliferative activities, interferons are not antiproliferative for all cell types. For some cells they have no effect on cell proliferation (43Thornton S.C. Por S.B. Walsh B.J. Penny R. Breit S.N. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1990; 47: 312-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 44Saunders N.A. Smith R.J. Jetten A.M. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol.

Maltha J.C. Kuijpers-Jagtman A.M. Arch. Oral Biol. 1999; 44: 541-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), and for others they can actually be growth-stimulatory (40Hunninghake G.W. Hemken C. Brady M. Monick M. Am. Rev. Respir. Dis. 1986; 134: 1025-1028Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 41Brinckerhoff C.E. Guyre P.M. J.

IFN-γ has been shown to be growth-promoting or mitogenic for a variety of human fibroblasts, such as human lung, synovial, or dental pulp fibroblasts. The combined observations that IFN-γ is growth-stimulatory for NIH 3T3 fibroblasts and that mGBP-2 is capable of the same growth stimulatory activity in the absence of other IFN-induced proteins support a role for mGBP-2 in IFN-mediated cell growth regulation. However, the mechanism(s) by which mGBP-2 mediates its growth-stimulatory effects remains to be elucidated. As mentioned above, one possibility is that mGBP-2 functions within a pathway used by other small GTPases, such as members of the Rho family. The Rho proteins are important regulators for a number of growth-related processes. Certainly, Rho family proteins are involved in regulation of cytoskeleton organization and cytokinesis. They are also necessary for integrin-mediated signals, and in this capacity are actively involved in transducing cell growth signals. Alternatively, mGBP-2 may up-regulate the expression of growth factor receptors or other components involved in mitogenic signaling. How mGBP-2 mediates these growth changes is actively under investigation. Cellular responses to interferons (IFNs) 1IFNinterferonGBPguanylate-binding protein 1IFNinterferonGBPguanylate-binding protein involve the transcriptional induction of hundreds of genes (reviewed in Refs.1Stark G.R.

Ozbek K. Schaub A. Futterer A. Pleffer K. Howard J.C. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 6715-6723PubMed Google Scholar). For type I IFNs (α/β) the most abundantly induced GTPases are the members of the Mx family. Although the function of Mx proteins is not fully understood, some have been shown to have antiviral activity (reviewed in Refs. 6Haller O. Frese M. Koch G. Rev. Sci. Tech. Off. Int. Epizoot. 1998; 17: 220-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar and 7Pavlovic J. Schroder A. Blank A. Pitossi F. Staeheli P. CIBA Found. Symp. 1993; 176: 233-243PubMed Google Scholar). The response of cells to type II IFN (IFN-γ) is dominated by the induction of two families of GTPases, the 47-kDa family and the guanylate-binding proteins (GBPs) (5Boehm U. Guethlein L. Klamp T. Ozbek K. Schaub A. Futterer A. Pleffer K. Howard J.C. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 6715-6723PubMed Google Scholar). Little is known about the function of either of these families of proteins, with the exception of the 47-kDa family protein, IGTP, that has been shown to have antimicrobial action against Toxoplasma gondii (8Taylor G.A.

GBPs have only two easily identifiable motifs, a guanine nucleotide-binding site and, for most GBPs, a CAAXsite for isoprenoid modification. GBPs are unlike other GTPases in that they have only two of the three conserved regions of the standard guanine nucleotide-binding site (24Dever T.E. Glynias M.J. Merrick W.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Consistent with these primary sequence differences, GBPs display a wider range of guanine nucleotide binding and hydrolysis than many other GTPases.

We have generated evidence for an indirect monocyte-dependent immunoregulatory pathway. Recently, interleukin (IL) 4 has been shown to produce “new” potential peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) ligands by inducing macrophage 12/15-lipoxygenase (12/15-LO). We have shown previously that the activated PPARγ is a profound inhibitor of IL-2 transcription in human T lymphocytes. It is hypothetically possible that IL-4 might indirectly affect IL-2 production by Thp cells via macrophage-derived PPARγ ligands. Using human monocytes and T lymphocytes from same donors, we have found that monocyte 12/15-LO products mediate the indirect inhibitory effect of IL-4 on anti-CD3- or phytohemagglutinin/phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-stimulated IL-2 production by T lymphocytes. We further analyzed which major 12/15-LO metabolites contributed to the above inhibition. 13-Hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid (13-HODE), a 12/15-LO product, markedly blocked IL-2 production by human blood T lymphocytes, but not Jurkat T cells. Moreover, the IL-4-conditioned macrophage medium contained a sufficient amount of 13-HODE and anti-13-HODE antibody indeed neutralized the inhibitory effects of the IL-4-conditional medium on T-cell IL-2 production. Using human T lymphocytes and the PPARγ-transfected Jurkat T cells, we demonstrated the specific inhibition by 13-HODE of the transcription factors NFAT (nuclear factor of activated T cells) and nuclear factor κB, the IL-2 promoter reporter, and IL-2 production. However, 15-hydroxytetraenoic acid had little inhibitory effect. The potency of such inhibitory effects correlates well with the capability of the above metabolic lipids to activate PPARγ. These data provide a mechanism whereby IL-4 may indirectly affect Thp function via PPARγ activated by macrophage products of the 12/15-LO pathway.

Some of these immunoregulatory cytokines possess cross-regulatory properties and can enhance or suppress cytokine production by Th1 or Th2 subset. Thp cells are the pluripotent precursors of Th1 and Th2 cells (4Brown M.A. Hural J. Crit. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 17: 1-32Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, the development of either Th1 or Th2 helper cells is believed to be determined by the effects of cytokines directly on helper Thp cells. IL-4 is principally produced by helper T cells of the Th2 phenotype. IL-4 has been shown to be a pleiotropic lymphokine with an array of biologic effects on multiple cell lineages (5Nelms K. Keegan A.D. Zamorano J. Ryan J.J. Paul W.E. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1999; 17: 701-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (1320) Google Scholar, 6Peterson J.D. Herzenberg L.A. Vasquez K. Waltenbaugh C. Proc. Natl.

IL-4 can function as a growth factor for activated T cells including promoting T cell proliferation and IL-2 production (7Kawakami Y. Custer M.C. Rosenberg S.A. Lotze M.T. J. Immunol. 1989; 142: 3452-3461PubMed Google Scholar, 8Mitchell L.C. Davis L.S. Lipsky P.E. J. Immunol. 1989; 142: 1548-1557PubMed Google Scholar). Importantly, all of the effects of IL-4 on human T cells have been inferred from experiments using mixed population of cells. Inasmuch as IL-4 has been shown to have effects on a variety of cell types, including monocyte/macrophages and B cells that can function as accessory cells. IL-4 can inhibit IL-2 synthesis by concanavalin A-stimulating CD4+ human T cells in the presence of accessory cells (9Martinez O.M. Gibbons R.S. Garovoy M.R. Aronson F.R. J. Immunol. 1990; 144: 2211-2215PubMed Google Scholar, 10Gaya A. DelaCalle O. Yague J. Alsinet E. Fernandez M.D. Romero M. Fabregat V. Martorell J. Vives J. J. Immunol. 1991; 146: 4209-4214PubMed Google Scholar). It is hypothetically possible that the effect of IL-4 on human T cell activation is indirect and mediated by one of these accessory cells. The monocyte/macrophage is well recognized as essential in the regulation of lymphocyte function. Some aspects of this regulation involve the release of soluble mediators by monocyte macrophages. Interestingly, IL-4 has been shown to induce 12/15-lipoxygenase (LO) in monocytes/macrophages, which in turn produce “new” potential peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) ligands (11Huang J.T. Welch J.S. Ricote M. Binder C.J. Willson T.M. Kelly C. Witztum J.L. Funk C.D. Conrad D. Glass C.K. Nature. 1999; 400: 378-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (781) Google Scholar). PPARγ is a unique member of ligand-dependent nuclear receptor family that has been implicated in the modulation of critical aspects of development and homeostasis, including adipocyte differentiation, glucose metabolism, and macrophage development and function (12Schoonjans K.

Previously, we have shown the expression of PPARγ in human T cells. Using a range of synthetic and natural PPARγ ligands, including troglitazone and 15d-prostaglandin J2, we have demonstrated that activation of PPARγ could block IL-2 production in T cells by inhibiting NFAT-mediated transcription of the IL-2 gene. Activated PPARγ physically associated with NFAT, blocking IL-2 promoter activity. This represented a novel mechanism and function of the PPARγ nuclear receptor in T cell biology (16Yang X.Y.

It is well known that IL-4 exerts immunomodulatory effects on monocytes and T cells. These observations led us to hypothesize that IL-4 might indirectly affect the production of IL-2 by Thp helper cells by inducing the production of these potential PPARγ ligands by macrophage 12/15-lipoxygenase, which in turn interfere with the subsequent development of T helper cells. Human IL-4 was from PeproTech Inc. 13-HODE and 15-HETE were from Cayman Chemical. PD146176 and troglitazone were the gifts from Dr. J. Cornicelli and M. A. Caballero of Parke-Davis. Anti-13-HODE antibody and 13-HODE immunoassay kit were from Oxford Biomedical Research. Human peripheral blood monocytes and T lymphocytes were obtained from same healthy donors and cultured in RPMI with 10% fetal calf serum (Sigma), 2 mm l-glutamine, and penicillin-streptomycin (50 IU/ml and 50 μg/ml, respectively; Invitrogen). Jurkat T cells were maintained under the same conditions. 3T3-L1 preadipocytes were cultured, maintained, and differentiated as described previously by Hamm et al. (17Hamm J.K. Park B.H. Farmer S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18464-18471Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar) and Shao and Lazar (18Shao D. Lazar M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21473-21478Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). T cells were grown to ∼2.5 × 106 cells/ml and treated with anti-CD3 or PHA/PMA in the presence or absence of the different ligands for 24 h. Cell supernatants were collected and assayed for IL-2 by ELISA using Endogen kits (Wolburn). 13-HODE was extracted from each sample at 4 °C as follows. The solution was acidified to a pH of 3.5–4.0. The organic phase of the solution was extracted using water-saturated ethyl acetate. Samples were dried completely under nitrogen, then reconstituted with a mixture of 25 μl of methanol, 975 μl of dilution buffer, and 50 μl of chloroform. The pH was adjusted to 7.2, and the samples were stored at −20 °C. The plates pre-coated with anti-13-HODE antibodies were used to measure 13-HODE levels at room temperature. Serial dilutions of sample extracts were prepared, and 100-μl volumes of each dilution were added to wells. An aliquot of 100 μl of a 13-HODE-horseradish peroxidase conjugate (1:1000) was added to each well, and the plates were incubated for 2 h at room temperature. Wells were washed twice with wash buffer, and 200 μl of 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine reagent was added. After incubated for 20 min, the reaction was terminated by adding 50 μl of 1 n sulfuric acid. The absorbance was measured using a microtiter plate reader at 450 nm. The nuclear extractions from primary T cells were prepared as described (19Spindler S.A. Clark K.S. Callewaert D.M. Reddy R.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 218: 187-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The sequences of the oligonucleotides (5′ to 3′) used as probes were CACCCCCATATTATTTTTCCAGCATT (NFAT) or AGTTGAGGGGACTTTCCAGGC (NF-κB). 32P-Labeled double-stranded oligonucleotides were then incubated with 5 μg of nuclear extracted proteins in 15 μl of binding mixture (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 25 mm MgCl2, 5 mmdithiothreitol, 50% glycerol) at 4 °C for 2 h. The DNA-protein complexes were resolved in a 5% polyacrylamide gel. Transient transfections of human blood T lymphocytes upon stimulation with a concentration of PHA (1 μg/ml) were performed by the method described by Hughes et al. (23Hughes C.C.W. Pober J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5369-5377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) and Cron et al. (24Cron R.Q. Schubert L.A. Lewis D.B. Hughes C.C. J. Immunol. Methods. 1997; 205: 145-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). For Jurkat T cells, transfection was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions for FuGENE 6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Briefly, FuGENE 6 was mixed with the plasmid DNA at the ratio of 2:1. The mixture was incubated for 20 min at room temperature and then added to cell culture flask containing 2 × 107 cells. After 6 h, cells were washed twice with RPMI 1640, replaced in normal medium, and seeded in a 12-well plate. Cells were treated with or without different ligands for an additional 24 h in the present or absence of PHA/PMA. The transfected cells were pelleted, lysed, and then centrifuged at 12,000 × g in a microcentrifuge for 2 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was transferred into a new tube, and 20 μl of lysate was mixed with 100 μl of luciferase assay reagent in cuvettes for the luminometer. The luciferase assay measurement was normalized by the protein amount. Samples were applied to 7.5% SDS gels and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore). Membranes were blocked overnight in Tris-buffered saline plus Tween with 5% nonfat dry milk and incubated with anti-human 15-LO antibodies (Calbiochem), anti-PPARγ monoclonal antibody (Santa Cruz), anti-NFATc (PharMingen), or anti-NF-κB (p65 or p50) (Santa Cruz) at 4 °C overnight. After washing, membranes were stained with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies. Protein detection was performed with an ECL detection system. To examine the possibility and physiological relevance of the regulation of the soluble mediators released by IL-4-treated monocyte/macrophages on T lymphocyte activation, we first tested the effect of products from IL-4-treated macrophages on IL-2 production by fresh human T lymphocytes. Human peripheral blood monocytes and T lymphocytes were obtained from the same donor. Human blood monocytes were cultured with or without IL-4 for 96 h (11Huang J.T. Welch J.S. Ricote M. Binder C.J. Willson T.M. Kelly C. Witztum J.L. Funk C.D. Conrad D. Glass C.K. Nature. 1999; 400: 378-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (781) Google Scholar). Human T lymphocytes were stimulated with the human anti-CD3 antibody or PHA/PMA plus the above macrophage-conditioned medium. After 24 h, the supernatants were collected and tested their IL-2 content by ELISA. As shown in Fig.1a, T cells stimulated with anti-CD3 or PHA/PMA in conditioned medium from IL-4-treated macrophages produced significantly less (−62.2% or −44.5%, respectively) IL-2. However, this inhibition was reversed by medium conditioned by macrophages treated with IL-4 and PD146176, the specific 12/15-LO inhibitor, when compared with non-IL-4-treated macrophages. Direct treatment with PD146176 or IL-4 on purified T cells had no observable inhibitory effects (data not shown). Furthermore, Western blot analysis showed the expression of 12/15-LO by IL-4-induced monocytes, but not by blood primary T lymphocytes or Jurkat T cells (Fig. 1b), which was consistent with the previous reports that IL-4 induces 12/15-LO expression on human monocyte (27Conrad D.J. Kühn H. Mulkin M. Highland E. Sigal E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 217-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar), but not human lymphocytes (28Brinckmann R. Topp M.S. Zalan I. Heydeck D. Ludwig P. Kuhn H. Berdel W.E. Habenicht J.R. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 305-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). T-lymphocytes isolated from human blood probably do not metabolize polyunsaturated fatty acid via the lipoxygenase pathway (29Goldyne M.E. Burrish G.F. Poubelle P. Borgeat P. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 8815-8819Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These findings suggest that monocyte 12/15-LO products contribute to an indirect inhibitory effect of IL-4 on IL-2 production by T lymphocytes. 12/15-Lipoxygenase generates bioactive lipid mediators from free polyunsaturated fatty acids in human monocytes/macrophages (30Conrad D.J. Clin. Rev. Allergy Immunol. 1999; 17: 71-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). 13-HODE and 15-HETE are the major metabolites formed from exogenous linoleic acid and arachidonic acid. To clarify the mechanism underlying these inhibitory effects of macrophage 12/15-lipoxygenase products on T cell activation, we compared the direct effects of the above IL-4/macrophage-induced 12/15-lipoxygenase products on T cell activation. Human peripheral blood T cells were stimulated with PHA/PMA and cultured with various concentrations of different ligands for 24 h. As shown in Fig.2, 13-HODE markedly decreased anti-CD3- or PHA/PMA-induced IL-2 synthesis in a dose-dependent manner. In contrast, 15-HETE showed very weak inhibitory effects on anti-CD3- or PHA/PMA-induced T cell activation. These results suggest 13-HODE, but not 15-HETE, is a major bioactive mediator, present in 12/15-lipoxygenase macrophage products interfering with T lymphocyte activation. A reasonably high level of exogenous 13-HODE is required to achieve significant inhibition of IL-2 production by T cells. Thus, it is critical to determine whether the conditioned medium does contain a sufficient amount of 13-HODE. We measured the concentration of 13-HODE in the conditioned medium by a competitive ELISA. As shown in TableI, IL-4 could increase the amount of 13-HODE to an approximately concentration of 40 μm, which was corresponding well with ED50 of exogenous 13-HODE used in our experiments. However, in the presence of PD146176, the formation of 13-HODE induced by IL-4 was significantly decreased. Furthermore, because the anti-13-HODE antibody used in this study was reported previously to react with 13-HODE in human prostate tissues, we thus asked if the anti-13-HODE antibody does affect the inhibition of the IL-4-induced monocyte conditional medium on IL-2 production by T-cells. Fig. 1a also showed the addition of anti-13-HODE antibody indeed neutralized the inhibitory effects of the IL-4-induced monocyte conditional medium on IL-2 production by anti-CD3- or PHA/PMA-stimulated T-cells. By contrast, when anti-13-HODE antibody was replaced by control normal goat serum, the decrease in T cell IL-2 production caused by IL-4-induced monocyte conditional medium remained at the same level (data not shown). These results confirmed 13-HODE produced by IL-4-induced macrophages is significant enough to down-regulate T cell activation.Table IThe 13-HODE concentration in macrophage conditional mediumControlIL-4IL-4 + PD14617613-HODE (μm)4.31 ± 0.1238.62 ± 1.1813.55 ± 0.93 Open table in a new tab Because IL-4 strongly produced novel PPARγ ligands by 12/15-LO in monocytes (11Huang J.T.

Nature. 1999; 400: 378-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (781) Google Scholar), we determined whether inhibition of 12/15-lipoxygenase products on T lymphocytes was through PPARγ. We performed Western blot analysis to confirm the expression of PPARγ on human T lymphocytes. As shown in Fig.3a, differentiated 3T3-L1 cells, which express both PPARγ1 and PPARγ2 isoforms (17Hamm J.K. Park B.H. Farmer S.R. J. Biol.

Human T lymphocytes and monocytes, but not Jurkat T cells, contained PPARγ protein, which was consistent with the Northern blot results described by Greene et al. (33Greene M.E. Blumberg B. McBride O.W. Yi H.F. Kronquist K. Kwan K. Hsieh L. Greene G. Nimer S.D. Gene Expr. 1995; 4: 281-299PubMed Google Scholar). We next tested the effect of 13-HODE on IL-2 production by Jurkat T cells, which lacks PPARγ, to verify the necessity of PPARγ expression for the repressive effects of PPARγ ligands observed on human T lymphocytes. Fig.3b showed 13-HODE and troglitazone did not decrease the production of IL-2 by Jurkat T cells. These results indicated that PPARγ might be involved in inhibition of 12/15-LO metabolites, as PPARγ ligands, on human T lymphocytes. To determine whether the inhibitory effect of 12/15-lipoxygenase products on IL-2 synthesis can be ascribed, at least in part, to disruption of IL-2 promoter (34Jain J. Loh C. Rao A. Curr. Opin.

PMA/PHA treatment resulted in a marked increase in IL-2 promoter activity. 13-HODE, but not 15-HETE, was able to largely block IL-2 promoter activity in human T lymphocytes (Fig. 4), which was in parallel to the observation on the inhibition of other PPARγ ligands on PPARγ-transfected Jurkat T cells (16Yang X.Y.

These data suggest that the inhibitory effect of 12/15-lipoxygenase products on IL-2 synthesis was caused by disruption of IL-2 promoter activity in human T lymphocytes even in the absence of overexpression of PPARγ. The IL-2 promoter contains five NFAT binding sites, an NF-κB binding site, and two Oct-1 sites (35Crabtree G.R.

Previously, we have shown that activation of PPARγ with 15d-prostaglandin J2 and troglitazone block NFAT by forming a complex (16Yang X.Y. Wang L.H. Chen T. Hodge D.R. Resau J.H. DaSilva L. Farrar W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4541-4544Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). Therefore, we evaluated the effect of 13-HODE and 15-HETE on DNA binding and transcriptional activity of NFAT. As shown by EMSA in Fig.5a, the specific binding of an NFAT probe corresponding to the human IL-2 promoter was strongly induced by PHA/PMA in human T lymphocytes, which could be shifted by anti-NFATc. Equivalent nuclear extracts from 13-HODE-treated cells displayed diminished binding capacity by the32P-radiolabeled probes. This indicated 13-HODE could block the DNA binding activity of NFAT. In contrast, Western blot analysis showed that the expression of NFAT (Fig. 5b) did not change with 13-HODE and 15-HETE treatment. Furthermore, the transcriptional activation of NFAT was measured on PPARγ-transfected Jurkat T cells (16Yang X.Y. Wang L.H. Chen T. Hodge D.R. Resau J.H. DaSilva L. Farrar W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4541-4544Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar, 41Elbrecht A. Chen Y. Cullinan C.A. Hayes N. Leibowitz M.D. Moller D.E. Berger J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 224: 431-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar) by a reporter construct directed by the NFAT distal site of the IL-2 promoter. PHA/PMA strongly induced transactivation of NFAT. The treatment of 13-HODE could abrogate the transcriptional activity of NFAT induced by PHA/PMA in the presence of PPARγ overexpression (Fig.5c). However, 15-HETE did not significantly inhibit DNA binding and transcriptional activity of NFAT. Interestingly, the inhibitory effect of the above 12/15-LO metabolic lipids correlates well with their capability to activate PPARγ. To determine whether transcription factor NF-κB was equally inhibited by 13-HODE and 15-HETE in T cells, the DNA binding and transcriptional activity of NF-κB were examined. For this case, nuclear cell extracts were incubated with the NF-κB DNA binding element and supershifted with the p65 or p50 antibody to confirm the identity. The antibody directed against p50 (not p65) could significantly supershift the NF-κB DNA binding. 13-HODE, but not 15-HETE, was effective at inhibiting PHA/PMA-inducible NF-κB DNA binding activity (Fig. 6a), although the above 12/15-LO metabolic lipids did not affect the protein level of NF-κB (Fig. 6b) in human T lymphocytes. Moreover, we analyzed NF-κB transactivation by a luciferase reporter gene. As shown in Fig. 6c, NF-κB transcription activity following PHA/PMA stimulation was inhibited by 13-HODE but not 15-HETE in the overexpression of PPARγ. Thus, there appears to be a selective disruption of the transcriptional regulation of the IL-2 promoter mediated by specific 12/15-lipoxygenase products repressing IL-2 production by human T cells. IL-2 is primarily a product of the Thp and Th1 subclasses of helper T cells. IL-2 production is indicative of T cell activation and is the major autocrine and paracrine growth factor for T cells. Therefore, the regulation of IL-2 production is a key event for control of T cell survival, clonal expansion, and functional differentiation and development (34Jain J. Loh C. Rao A. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1995; 7: 333-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar, 35Crabtree G.R. Cell. 1999; 96: 611-614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (669) Google Scholar). It has been reported that the Th2 cytokine IL-4 plays a critical role in the development of T helper cells by regulating IL-2 production by Thp cells in both a direct and an indirect manner (4Brown M.A. Hural J. Crit. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 17: 1-32Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Nelms K. Keegan A.D. Zamorano J. Ryan J.J. Paul W.E. Annu. Rev.

Moreover, IL-4 largely potently decreases the transcriptional activation of IL-2 in response to concanavalin A in normal human peripheral blood T cells in the presence of 10% accessory cells. These observations suggest that monocytes/macrophages, as typical accessory cells, are of central importance in the initiation, development, and outcome of the immune response and are also a target for type 1 and type 2 cytokines in the immune response (9Martinez O.M. Gibbons R.S. Garovoy M.R. Aronson F.R. J. Immunol. 1990; 144: 2211-2215PubMed Google Scholar, 10Gaya A. DelaCalle O. Yague J. Alsinet E. Fernandez M.D. Romero M. Fabregat V. Martorell J. Vives J. J. Immunol. 1991; 146: 4209-4214PubMed Google Scholar). The data presented in this study support an important role for macrophages in the indirect pathway of IL-4 in inhibiting IL-2 production by fresh human peripheral blood T cells. Furthermore, we provided evidence that monocyte/macrophage 12/15-lipoxygenase products mediate this indirect inhibitory effect of IL-4 on IL-2 production by T lymphocytes and requires the expression of PPARγ in Thp lymphocytes. IL-4 is a potent modulator of monocyte function through modulating the metabolism of polyunsaturated fatty acids. IL-4 can induce 12/15-lipoxygenase (42Heydeck D. Thomas L. Schnurr K. Trebus F. Thierfelder W.E. Ihle J.N. Kuhn H. Blood. 1998; 92: 2503-2510Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and suppress prostaglandin H synthase (cyclooxygenases)-2 (43Mertz P.M. Corcoran M.L. McCluskey K.M.

Med. 1994; 180: 1457-1469Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) in monocytes. Very recently, Spanbroek et al. (46Spanbroek R. Hildner M. Kohler A. Muller A. Zintl F. Kuhn H. Radmark O. Samuelsson B. Habenicht A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 5152-5157Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) reported that IL-4 determines eicosanoid formation in differentiating dendritic cells derived from hematopoietic progenitor cells and human blood monocytes by up-regulation of 15-LO and down-regulation of 5-LO. The enzyme 15-lipoxygenase is unique among the human lipoxygenases in that it is capable of oxygenating polyenoic fatty acids esterified to membrane lipids or lipoproteins, and hence it may have biological roles distinct from its action on free arachidonic acid. 12/15-Lipoxygenase has been implicated in a number of cellular processes, including degradation of intracellular organelles and oxidation of low density lipoprotein, and in a wide variety of disease states such as atherosclerosis, asthma, and psoriasis (27Conrad D.J. Kühn H. Mulkin M. Highland E. Sigal E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 217-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). 15-LO was also shown to mediate nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug-induced apoptosis independently of cyclooxygenase-2 in colon cancer cells (47Shureiqi I. Chen D. Lotan R. Yang P. Newman R.A. Fischer S.M. Lippman S.M. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 6846-6850PubMed Google Scholar). Human 15-lipoxygenase is a potential effector molecule for IL-4. Although the enzyme activity of 12/15-LO is low or undetectable in quiescent peripheral blood monocytes, IL-4 specifically induces 12/15-LO mRNA, protein expression (Fig. 1b) and enzymatic activity and dramatically increased the formation of 13-HODE and 15-HETE in cultured monocytes probably through a Stat6-dependent pathway (42Heydeck D. Thomas L. Schnurr K. Trebus F. Thierfelder W.E. Ihle J.N. Kuhn H. Blood. 1998; 92: 2503-2510Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 13-HODE may also be present in even higher amounts because linoleic acid may be the preferred substrate for human 15-LO. Using a competitive ELISA, we have found IL-4 indeed increased the level of 13-HODE in monocytes (Table I). Moreover, anti-HODE also could neutralize the inhibitory effect of IL-4-treated monocyte conditional medium on IL-2 production by T cells (Fig. 1a). Recently, Nagy et al. (48Nagy L. Tontonoz P. Alvarez J.G. Chen H. Evans R.M. Cell. 1998; 93: 229-240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1599) Google Scholar) and Tontonoz et al. (49Tontonoz P. Nagy L. Alvarez J.G. Thomazy V.A. Evans R.M. Cell. 1998; 93: 241-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1617) Google Scholar) reported that 13-HODE, which is formed by 15-LO and by oxidation of lipid component in cells, is a potent endogenous activator and ligand for PPARγ. However, 15-HETE was only a weak activation of PPARγ. Using human T lymphocytes and PPARγ-transfected Jurkat T cells, we confirmed the capability of the above 12/15-LO products to activate PPARγ in human T lymphocytes. PPARγ is a ligand-dependent transcription factor and activated by diverse synthetic and naturally occurring substances. Although most studies concern the regulation of glucose and lipid metabolism (48Nagy L. Tontonoz P. Alvarez J.G. Chen H. Evans R.M.

Desvergne B. Wahli W. Nature. 2000; 405: 421-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (1678) Google Scholar, 52Brun R.P. Kim J.B. Hu E. Spiegelman B.M. Curr. Opin.

Immunol. 2001; 166: 7104-7111Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Previously, we have reported the role of PPARγ in T lymphocyte activation including inhibition of IL-2 production and PHA-induced cell proliferation. In this study, we have been able to confirm the expression of PPARγ in human blood T lymphocytes and demonstrate an inhibitory effect of these novel PPARγ ligands produced by the monocyte 12/15-lipoxygenase on T cell IL-2 production and activity of the IL-2 promoter reporter. Furthermore, EMSA and luciferase reporter analysis revealed that the above 12/15-LO products suppressed IL-2 promoter by antagonizing the DNA binding activities and transactivation of the transcription factors NFAT and NF-κB in a PPARγ-dependent manner. Importantly, the potency of such inhibitory effects correlates well with the capability of the above metabolic lipids to activate PPARγ. These findings suggest that activation of PPARγ in T cells by 12/15-LO macrophage products is a key means by which IL-4 indirectly inhibits Thp cell function. In summary, we have identified and molecularly characterized a previously undescribed immunoregulatory circuit. Cytokines, such as IL-4, may up-regulate ligands that activate the PPARγ receptor expressed in T lymphocytes and exert profound indirect effects on T lymphocyte biology via nonsteroidal nuclear receptors.

Wang for kindly discussion."

From work with a CD8-Nef fusion protein, it was proposed that cellular location defined whether Nef expression resulted in negative or positive effects on T cell activity (12Baur A.S. Sawai E.T. Dazin P. Fantl W.J. Cheng-Mayer C. Peterlin B.M. Immunity. 1994; 1: 373-384Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Recent efforts from our laboratory have demonstrated that the opposing effects of Nef on T cell activation are also mediated by different Nef concentrations (13Liu X. Schrager J.A. Lange G.D. Marsh J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32763-32770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Nef can increase T cell interleukin-2 synthesis in both T cell lines and human primary CD4 T cells (14Rhee S.S. Marsh J.W. J.

A. 2000; 97: 394-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar) reporter activities. Thus, there is evolving support for Nef as a positive T cell factor. Attempts to define the biochemical capacity of Nef are numerous. Nef can bind to a number of cellular signaling moieties. For example, Nef binds to and activates the tyrosine kinase Hck (19Briggs S.D. Sharkey M. Stevenson M. Smithgall T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17899-17902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 20Moarefi I. LaFevre-Bernt M. Sicheri F. Huse M. Lee C.H. Kuriyan J. Miller W.T. Nature. 1997; 385: 650-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar), and the co-expression of Nef and Hck in Rat-2 fibroblasts resulted in cellular transformation, although Nef expression alone had no effect (19Briggs S.D. Sharkey M. Stevenson M. Smithgall T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17899-17902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). In a macrophage cell line, Nef, through Hck and MAP kinase, induces the transcription factor activating protein-1 (21Biggs T.E. Cooke S.J. Barton C.H. Harris M.P. Saksela K. Mann D.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 290: 21-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Hck is not expressed in T cells, but with regard to T cell kinases, Nef has been shown to bind and inhibit Lck and MAP kinase activity (22Greenway A. Azad A. Mills J. McPhee D. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 6701-6708Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Nef expression has also been demonstrated to alter calcium signaling. When expressed in NIH3T3 cells, Nef inhibited inositol trisphosphate-mediated calcium flux (23De S.K. Marsh J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6656-6660Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), an effect similar to that seen in a Jurkat cell expressing a Nef-CD8 fusion protein (12Baur A.S. Sawai E.T. Dazin P. Fantl W.J. Cheng-Mayer C. Peterlin B.M. Immunity. 1994; 1: 373-384Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). However, in Nef-expressing transgenic murine thymocytes, T cell stimulation resulted in elevated calcium responses (24Skowronski J. Parks D. Mariani R. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 703-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar), a finding more consistent with T cell activation enhancement. Nef also binds to an activated serine kinase, p21-activated kinase or Pak (25Nunn M.F. Marsh J.W. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 6157-6161Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and this association occurs in HIV-infected primary T cells (26Brown A. Wang X. Sawai E. Cheng-Mayer C. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 9899-9907Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In a recent exploration of Nef activity, it was demonstrated that the co-expression of Nef with Vav, through Pak, increased c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) activity in NIH3T3 cells (27Fackler O.T. Luo W. Geyer M. Alberts A.S. Peterlin B.M. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 729-739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). However, it is unclear how relevant these studies are to the activity of Nef in peripheral CD4 T cells, the main target of HIV infection. The biochemistry of T cell activation is highly complex, but many of the molecular pathways leading to IL-2 expression have been characterized (for reviews, see Refs. 28van Leeuwen J.E.M. Samelson L.E. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1999; 11: 242-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar and 29Kane L.P. Lin J. Weiss A. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2000; 12: 242-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). As used here, IL-2 is both a reporter for the metabolic activity of a T cell and the end-product of a highly characterized and dissectible biochemical process of the CD4 T cell. Per se, an increase in IL-2 levels does not significantly contribute to HIV replication (30Kovacs J.A. Vogel S. Albert J.M. Falloon J. Davey R.T., Jr. Walker R.E. Polis M.A. Spooner K. Metcalf J.A. Baseler M. Fyfe G. Lane H.C. N. Engl. J. Med. 1996; 335: 1350-1356Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). However, with a recent demonstration that Nef, as expressed from HIV infection, increased T cell activity (as defined by IL-2 secretion) and viral production (31Wu Y. Marsh J.W. Science. 2001; 293: 1503-1506Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar), an understanding of the biochemical activity of Nef in these contexts appears relevant. Events mediated by engagement of the T cell receptor and CD28 co-receptor result in activation of the MAP kinases extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), JNK, and p38, in addition to phosphorylation of IκB, elevation of cytosolic calcium, and activation of the kinase Akt. The pathways leading to these cytosolic signaling moieties are briefly outlined in Fig.1. The choice of kinases and signaling molecules is based on the assumption that Nef, as a cytosolic protein, would affect pathways in this cellular compartment. The choice was also to look at late cytosolic events, yielding the greatest opportunity to “capture” Nef effects. We make use of a system that expresses HIV Nef at concentrations similar to those seen in HIV infection (13Liu X. Schrager J.A. Lange G.D. Marsh J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32763-32770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) in hopes of identifying an indigenous pathway in primary CD4 T cells that would permit relevant molecular dissection. In this report, we demonstrate that Nef expression in primary CD4 T cells specifically increases activity of the ERK MAP kinase cascade. The peripheral lymphocyte fraction from healthy donors was obtained by leukapheresis and countercurrent centrifugal elutriation from the Department of Transfusion Medicine at the National Institutes of Health (32Czerniecki B.J.

Proliferation of purified CD4 T cells was achieved by the addition of CD3 plus CD28 antibody immobilized on magnetic beads (16Schrager J.A. Marsh J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8167-8172Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Primary CD4 T cells were transduced with the PA-317 retroviral LXSN system (3Garcia J.V. Miller A.D. Nature. 1991; 350: 508-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar) expressing either the NL4–3 Nef or the nonmyristylated NL4–3 Nef mutant, which was generated by a glycine to alanine switch at residue position 2 (G2A) (33Guy B. Riviere Y. Dott K. Regnault A. Kieny M.P. Virology. 1990; 176: 413-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Following selection in G418, Nef was detected by Western analysis (16Schrager J.A. Marsh J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8167-8172Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). For T cell functions, the G2A cells were found to be similar to the nontransduced cells, as previously noted (16Schrager J.A. Marsh J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8167-8172Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). All transductions were tested and found positive for Nef expression. For cell activation studies, magnetic beads were removed from proliferating cell cultures after gentle pipetting of the cells, followed by re-exposure to a magnetic field. Cells no longer bound to beads were removed. The bead-containing fraction was cycled through this process two or three times. The cells were resuspended at 2 million cells/ml in fresh RPMI with fetal calf serum and then rested overnight. The next day 4 million cells were resuspended in 1 ml of serum-free RPMI 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.4. At time 0, either 10 μg of anti-CD3 (clone HIT3A) or anti-CD3 plus anti-CD28 (clone CD28.2) beads (five beads per cell) was added at 37 °C with mixing. At defined times, cells were centrifuged at 4 °C for 30 s, and the cell pellet was resuspended in 200 μl of lithium dodecyl sulfate sample buffer (Novex), heated for 10 min at 70 °C, and sonicated for 20 s to shear DNA, and similar aliquots were applied to a 10% NuPage gel (Novex). The electrophoresis gel run was then transferred to nitrocellulose and probed with kinase-, substrate-, or phosphospecific antibodies (Cell Signaling Technology or Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA). Binding of antibodies was assayed by secondary peroxidase conjugate antibody (Kirkegaard and Perry) and developed with West Dura (Pierce) substrate. Measurements of generated light were achieved on an Alpha Innotech ChemiImager with a cooled CCD camera. For reprobing, blots were treated with Restore stripping solution (Pierce). For analysis of ERK phosphorylation of recombinant Elk-1, 4 million cells were suspended in 1 ml of serum-free RPMI, 25 mmHepes, pH 7.4. At time 0, cells were activated by the addition of antibody as described above. At defined times, cells were centrifuged at 4 °C for 30 s, and the cell pellet was resuspended into 1 ml of lysis buffer (20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 150 mmNaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 2.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mmβ-glycerolphosphate, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride). Lysates were sonicated and centrifuged at 14 K for 10 min, and the supernatant was aliquoted for kinase assays or frozen at −70 °C. Total cellular protein in the lysate was determined by micro-BCA protein assay, and then all samples to be compared were made equivalent in protein concentration. Immobilized phospho-ERK kinase antibody (Thr202/Tyr204) was used to purify active ERK kinase from the cell lysate, followed by an in vitro kinase assay utilizing recombinant Elk-1 protein (as purchased in assay kit form from New England Biolabs). A Western analysis for phospho-Ser383 Elk-1 was then performed as above. For this assay, we followed the protocols of the manufacturer. Free cytosolic calcium was determined by the procedure outlined for fluo-3 acetoxymethyl ester (AM) (34Kao J.P. Harootunian A.T. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8179-8184Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but using the fluo-4 AM plus Pluronic F-127 reagent from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR) with minor modifications. Cell loading of 4 μm fluo-4 AM was achieved in Hanks' balanced salt buffer with Hepes 25 mm, pH 7.4, 37 °C, 1 h. Loaded and washed cells were aliquoted in a 96-well plate (105 cells). Cells were stimulated through the addition of 2 μg of anti-CD3 antibody, and calcium levels were determined by measurement of emitted fluorescence at 37 °C on a CytoFluor 4000 (Perseptive Biosystems) fluorimeter fitted with a 485-nm excitation filter and a 530-nm emission filter. Calculation of intracellular calcium was achieved following the sequential addition of ionomycin and EGTA, as previously described (35Sharp B.M. Shahabi N.A. Heagy W. McAllen K. Bell M. Huntoon C. McKean D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8294-8299Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 36Tsien R.Y. Pozzan T. Rink T.J. Nature. 1982; 295: 68-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (776) Google Scholar), but a value of K d = 345 nm was used for fluo-4. For each experiment, cell number and volume were determined on a Coulter Z2 particle analyzer. We transduced purified primary CD4 T cells with either wild type NL4–3 Nef or the nonmyristylated G2A mutant of NL4–3 Nef retroviral expression vectors. The G2A mutant has previously been demonstrated to lack T cell enhancement capacity (16Schrager J.A. Marsh J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8167-8172Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 17Wang J.K. Kiyokawa E. Verdin E. Trono D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 394-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar) but serves as a control for the cellular manipulations of transduction and selection. Under the conditions used in this report, the G2A Nef-transduced cell performed identically to a nontransduced cell. Both native and G2A Nef-transduced cells specifically expressed Nef protein (Refs. 13Liu X. Schrager J.A. Lange G.D. Marsh J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32763-32770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar and 16Schrager J.A. Marsh J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8167-8172Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar; data not shown). Activation of the ERK MAP kinase pathway is essential for IL-2 synthesis (37Owaki H. Varma R. Gillis B. Bruder J.T. Rapp U.R. Davis L.S. Geppert T.D. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4367-4373Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 38Izquierdo M. Bowden S. Cantrell D. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 401-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). ERK is also central to the induction of cellular transcription and translation factors and activation of proliferation machinery (39Whitmarsh A.J. Davis R.J. Nature. 2000; 403: 255-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). In T cells, stimulation of the T cell receptor (CD-28 co-stimulus is not necessary) leads to ERK activity (40Izquierdo M. Leevers S.J. Marshall C.J. Cantrell D. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 178: 1199-1208Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). T cell activation involves two ERK species (ERK1 and ERK2) of different molecular weights (∼44,000 and 42,000, respectively). Activation of this kinase is achieved by MEK1/2 phosphorylation of a pair of threonine and tyrosine residues of ERK (41Payne D.M. Rossomando A.J. Martino P. Erickson A.K. Her J.H. Shabanowitz J. Hunt D.F. Weber M.J. Sturgill T.W. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 885-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (842) Google Scholar). This active dual phosphorylated species was quantitated by phosphospecific antibody binding on Western blots developed from electrophoresis gels of cell lysates. Control and Nef-expressing primary CD4 T cells were maintained by stimulation with CD3-CD28 antibodies immobilized on magnetic beads (see “Experimental Procedures”). Prior to activation, the cells were removed from beads and rested overnight. As shown in Fig.2 A, active phosphorylated forms of both ERK1 (p44) and ERK2 (p42) are generated following stimulation with soluble CD3 antibody. The level of activated ERK was dramatically increased in Nef-expressing cells, but not in the nonmyristylated G2A Nef mutant transduced cell. Probing this blot for total ERK protein (activated plus nonactivated) displayed no differences, demonstrating that the Nef-mediated increase in ERK1 and -2 activity was not due to changes in total ERK protein. For comparative purposes, we have plotted the induction of ERK activity with time (Fig. 2 B). The inability of the nonmyristylated G2A mutant Nef to mediate the Nef increase in ERK activity is consistent with its lack of effect on T cell activation enhancement (16Schrager J.A. Marsh J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8167-8172Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 17Wang J.K. Kiyokawa E. Verdin E. Trono D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 394-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). The ERK activity was increased by Nef in cells from three different donors and, in addition, was evident in cells stimulated by CD3-CD28 beads (data not shown). T cells also possess two other inducible MAP kinases, JNK and p38. JNK is induced in T cells by CD3 plus CD28 co-stimulation (42Su B. Jacinto E. Hibi M. Kallunki T. Karin M. Ben-Neriah Y. Cell. 1994; 77: 727-736Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (849) Google Scholar). JNK activation in T cells is achieved by SEK1 (also known as MKK4)-mediated phosphorylation of a proximal threonine and tyrosine pair in JNK (43Derijard B. Raingeaud J. Barrett T., Wu, I.H. Han J.H. Ulevitch R.J. Davis R.J. Science. 1995; 267: 682-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (1415) Google Scholar). Rested primary human CD4 T cells were stimulated with beads containing immobilized anti-CD3 and CD28 antibodies. As shown in Fig.3 A, JNK activation was dependent on stimulation. Unlike the activity of MAP kinase ERK, there is no measurable effect on JNK activity in primary CD4 T cells by HIV Nef. Comparison of total JNK protein is also displayed in Fig.3 A. A third MAP kinase, p38, is also activated by threonine-tyrosine phosphorylation (44Han J. Lee J.D. Bibbs L. Ulevitch R.J. Science. 1994; 265: 808-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (2420) Google Scholar, 45Raingeaud J. Gupta S. Rogers J.S. Dickens M. Han J.H. Ulevitch R.J. Davis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7420-7426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2046) Google Scholar). Relative to ERK, the phosphorylation of p38 was less intense and required higher exposure. As shown in Fig.3 B, activation of p38 in the absence or presence of Nef was similar. Akt kinase (also known as protein kinase B) is downstream of phosphoinositide 3-kinase activity and is phosphorylated on Thr308 by a phosphatidylinositol trisphosphate-dependent Akt/protein kinase B kinase (46Stephens L. Anderson K. Stokoe D. Erdjument-Bromage H. Painter G.F. Holmes A.B. Gaffney P.R.J. Reese C.B. McCormick F. Tempst P. Coadwell J. Hawkins P.T. Science. 1998; 279: 710-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (916) Google Scholar) and on Ser473 by autophosphorylation (47Toker A. Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8271-8274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). Engagement of the surface receptors resulted in the anticipated phosphorylation of Akt, as shown in Fig. 3 B, and Nef expression appeared to have no effect. The NF-κB transcription factor is inactive when bound to the inhibitory factor IκB (48Baeuerle P.A. Baltimore D. Science. 1988; 242: 540-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (1689) Google Scholar). The phosphorylation of Ser32/Ser36 (49Traenckner E.B.M. Pahl H.L. Henkel T. Schmidt K.N. Wilk S. Baeuerle P.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2876-2883Crossref PubMed Scopus (934) Google Scholar, 50Brown K. Gerstberger S. Carlson L. Franzoso G. Siebenlist U. Science. 1995; 267: 1485-1488Crossref PubMed Scopus (1317) Google Scholar) leads to release and degradation of IκBα, which correlates with NF-κB nuclear localization following T cell activation (51Kalli K. Huntoon C. Bell M. McKean D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3140-3148Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 52Khoshnan A. Kempiak S.J. Bennett B.L. Bae D., Xu, W. Manning A.M. June C.H. Nel A.E. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 5444-5452PubMed Google Scholar). To examine the effect of Nef on IκBα phosphorylation, Nef-expressing and control cells were stimulated with CD3-CD28 beads. Cells were lysed and applied to gel electrophoresis as above, blotted onto cellulose nitrate, and probed by anti-phospho-IκBα antibody (see Fig. 3 C). Stimulation of cells led to rapid phosphorylation of IκBα, and expression of Nef appeared to play no role in enhancing this process. Stimulation of the T cell receptor also results in a rapid elevation of intracellular calcium, a downstream effect of phospholipase Cγ1 activity. Cytosolic calcium was determined by fluorimetric measurement of free calcium binding by fluo-4. Response of control and Nef cells to T cell receptor stimulation resulted in similar cellular calcium elevations as shown in Fig. 3 D. Nef increased the induction of ERK MAP kinase but did not appear to affect other pathways. To further define pathway specificity, we then compared the phosphosphorylation state of MEK1/2 and SEK1 (MKK4), the specific upstream T cell kinases for ERK and JNK, respectively. As with the previous studies, T cells were rested overnight, then activated by antibody engagement of the T cell receptor. Like ERK, MEK1/2 activation-associated phosphorylation was found to be transient, with the highest levels around 5 min (Fig.4 A). Compared with the nontransduced controls and the G2A mutant Nef cells, the Nef-expressing cells displayed an increase in the induction of MEK1/2 activity, as measured by antibody recognition of the dual serine (Ser217/Ser221) phosphorylation by Raf. As with the ERK induction, we did not see Nef-mediated activation in the absence of T cell receptor stimulation. An examination of the induction of the corresponding kinase in the JNK pathway, SEK1 (MEKK4), demonstrated a similar dependence on surface receptor stimulation (Fig.4 B). Consistent with the lack of Nef on JNK activation, SEK1 activity was unchanged by Nef expression. The increased phosphorylation of ERK Thr202/Tyr204 by MEK (Fig. 2) and of MEK Ser217/Ser221 by Raf (Fig. 4) defines the pathway specifically enhanced by Nef expression. These phosphorylation measurements define activities upstream to ERK MAP kinase. Once active, ERK MAP kinase induces numerous downstream transcription factors, including the phosphorylation (Ser383) of Elk-1 (53Gille H. Kortenjann M. Thomae O. Moomaw C. Slaughter C. Cobb M.H. Shaw P.E. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 951-962Crossref PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar). We performed Western analysis on the lysate of activated control and Nef-expressing primary CD4 T cells. Increased specific phosphorylation of the Elk-1 Ser383 was evident in the Nef-expressing cells, compared with the control G2A Nef mutant cell (Fig.5 A) or nontransduced cells (data not shown). The increased phosphorylation of Elk was not due to an increase in Elk protein levels in the Nef-positive cell. In addition to MAP kinase ERK, Elk-1 can be phosphorylated by the MAP kinases JNK and p38 (54Janknecht R. Hunter T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1620-1627Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 55Price M.A. Cruzalegui F.H. Treisman R. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6552-6563Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar, 56Whitmarsh A.J. Yang S.H., Su, M.S.S. Sharrocks A.D. Davis R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2360-2371Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar), although activation of JNK or p38 in these studies does not appear to be affected by Nef. We then measured, in an in vitro kinase assay, Elk-1 phosphorylation by ERK kinase activity that was purified (separated from JNK and p38) from lysates of activated cells. As shown in Fig. 5 B, there was an increased induction of ERK MAP kinase activity in Nef-expressing T cells following T cell stimulation, consistent with increased Elk-1 phosphorylation in Nef-expressing cells (Fig. 5 A). We conclude that the ERK MAP kinase activation cascade is enhanced in Nef-expressing primary CD4 T cells. The lack of effect on other pathways emanating from the T cell surface receptor suggests that this activity is responsible for the enhancement in T cell activity. In addition, the mediated increase in ERK MAP kinase activity also connects Nef to previously characterized HIV infection processes. ERK activity has been demonstrated to increase HIV retroviral long terminal repeat expression (57Yang X. Chen Y. Gabuzda D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27981-27988Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar) and HIV replication (58Flory E. Weber C.K. Chen P. Hoffmeyer A. Jassoy C. Rapp U.R. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 2788-2794Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, viral infectivity has been found to be adversely affected by ERK pathway-specific inhibitors and enhanced by constitutive activation of this pathway (59Jacque J.M. Mann A. Enslen H. Sharova N. Brichacek B. Davis R.J. Stevenson M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2607-2618Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 60Yang X. Gabuzda D. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 3460-3466Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Vif (viral infectivityfactor) increases infectivity of HIV (61Fisher A.G. Ensoli B. Ivanoff L. Chamberlain M. Petteway S. Ratner L. Gallo R.C. Wong-Staal F. Science. 1987; 237: 888-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar, 62Strebel K. Daugherty D. Clouse K. Cohen D. Folks T. Martin M.A. Nature. 1987; 328: 728-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar), and its phosphorylation by ERK remarkably increases the activity of this viral regulatory protein (63Yang X. Gabuzda D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29879-29887Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Thus, the capacity of Nef to increase ERK activity suggests that a role of this viral protein in enhancing virion infectivity may, in part, be upstream to Vif activity. Our work with CD4 T cells suggests that Nef expression by itself does not activate the MAP kinase pathway. In our system, there is a requirement for stimulation of the surface T cell receptor. This is consistent with previous demonstrations that the Nef-mediated IL-2 induction in primary human CD4 T cells requires activation (16Schrager J.A. Marsh J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8167-8172Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 17Wang J.K. Kiyokawa E. Verdin E. Trono D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 394-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar) and that the HIV infection-induced hypersensitization of T cell IL-2 secretion is also dependent on T cell receptor stimulation (31Wu Y. Marsh J.W. Science. 2001; 293: 1503-1506Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar,64Ott M. Emiliani S. VanLint C. Herbein G. Lovett J. Chirmule N. McCloskey T. Pahwa S. Verdin E. Science. 1997; 275: 1481-1485Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Our finding appears to differ from a recent demonstration that co-expression of Nef with Vav, through Pak, increases JNK activity in NIH3T3 cells (27Fackler O.T. Luo W. Geyer M. Alberts A.S. Peterlin B.M. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 729-739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). We do not find an increase in JNK activity with Nef in the absence of or following T cell receptor stimulation. Two systematic differences may be responsible. First, the injection of plasmids into NIH3T3 cells would probably result in higher expression levels of Nef and Vav than those seen in the cells examined here. Second, while Pak can induce JNK in numerous cells (65Polverino A. Frost J. Yang P. Hutchison M. Neiman A.M. Cobb M.H. Marcus S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26067-26070Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 66Frost J.A., Xu, S. Hutchison M.R. Marcus S. Cobb M.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3707-3713Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar, 67Brown J.L. Stowers L. Baer M. Trejo J. Coughlin S. Chant J. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 598-605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar), Pak activity in T cells, following receptor stimulation, has been shown to be essential for ERK activity but not JNK (68Yablonski D. Kane L.P. Qian D. Weiss A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5647-5657Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The role of Pak in ERK activity is unresolved, and experimental approaches involving Nef are complicated by the potential for Nef to physically associate with different Pak isoforms and different Pak-associated nucleotide exchange factors (26Brown A. Wang X. Sawai E. Cheng-Mayer C. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 9899-9907Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 69Arora V. Molina R. Foster J. Blakemore J. Chernoff J. Fredericksen B. Garcia J. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 11081-11087Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 70Fackler O.T., Lu, X.B. Frost J.A. Geyer M. Jiang B. Luo W. Abo A. Alberts A.S. Peterlin B.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2619-2627Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 71Renkema G.H. Manninen A. Mann D.A. Harris M. Saksela K. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 1407-1410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The ability of Nef to affect ERK but not the JNK or p38 MAP kinase pathways suggests biochemical specificity for Nef molecular targeting, but our present understanding of the biochemical nature of T cell activation suggests broad possibilities. Differentiation of ERK from JNK and p38 MAP kinase activation can occur as early as the CD3-δ chain (72Delgado P. Fernandez E. Dave V. Kappes D. Alarcon B. Nature. 2000; 406: 426-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) and, obviously, as late in the pathway as the kinase species studied here. In fact, the effect of Nef at a distal biochemical site that is responsible for the enhanced ERK response could affect cellular or viral function not associated with the ERK activity. Previous efforts have demonstrated that recombinant Nef can associate with purified ERK MAP kinase (22Greenway A. Azad A. Mills J. McPhee D. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 6701-6708Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); however, this interaction inhibited MAP kinase activity. Nef has also been reported to bind Raf (73Hodge D.R. Dunn K.J. Pei G.K. Chakrabarty M.K. Heidecker G. Lautenberger J.A. Samuel K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15727-15733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), but the effect of this association on kinase activity is unknown. The positive effect of Nef on T cell IL-2 secretion following stimulation has been documented in murine, simian, and human T cell lines, as well as in primary human T cells (14Rhee S.S. Marsh J.W. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 5128-5134PubMed Google Scholar, 15Alexander L., Du, Z. Rosenzweig M. Jung J.U. Desrosiers R.C. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 6094-6099Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Schrager J.A.

A. 2000; 97: 394-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). The use of this system to resolve the biochemical activity of Nef in T cells is validated by the recent demonstration that Nef from HIV infection also increases this T cell response (31Wu Y. Marsh J.W. Science. 2001; 293: 1503-1506Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). Given that Nef increases both murine and human T cell activity, we believe the conclusion that Nef expression results in increased ERK activity in human T cells is corroborated by the transgenic study of Hanna et al. (74Hanna Z. Kay D.G. Rebai N. Guimond A. Jothy S. Jolicoeur P. Cell. 1998; 95: 163-175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). These authors found that Nef-expressing, CD3-stimulated murine thymocytes display enhanced phosphorylation of several proteins, including the Thr202/Tyr204 phosphorylation of ERK, characteristic of its activation by MEK1 (41Payne D.M. Rossomando A.J. Martino P. Erickson A.K. Her J.H. Shabanowitz J. Hunt D.F. Weber M.J. Sturgill T.W. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 885-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (842) Google Scholar, 75Seger R. Ahn N.G. Posada J. Munar E.S. Jensen A.M. Cooper J.A. Cobb M.H. Krebs E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14373-14381Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the findings for Nef bioactivity in primary CD4 T cells presented here appear to be reproducible in other cellular systems. Although the actual pathogenesis may indeed be different, this Nef activity is correlated with a state in these mice that is remarkably similar to the disease seen in humans; thus, further studies of the molecular activity of Nef that affects the MAP kinase pathway is warranted. In conclusion, the specificity for ERK MAP kinase activity over other T cell activation pathways offers an opportunity for biochemical resolution of Nef molecular activity.

https://openalex.org/W1988904267,"Insulin-like growth factor II is a fetal promoter of cell proliferation that is involved in some forms of cancer and overgrowth syndromes in humans. Here, we provide two sources of genetic evidence for a novel, pivotal role of locally produced insulin-like growth factor II in the development of atherosclerosis. First, we show that homozygosity for a disrupted insulin-like growth factor II allele in mice lacking apolipoprotein E, a widely used animal model of atherosclerosis, results in aortic lesions that are ∼80% smaller and contain ∼50% less proliferating cells compared with mice lacking only apolipoprotein E. Second, targeted expression of an insulin-like growth factor II transgene in smooth muscle cells, but not the mere elevation of circulating levels of the peptide, causes per se aortic focal intimal thickenings. The insulin-like growth factor II transgenics presented here are the first viable mutant mice spontaneously developing intimal masses. These observations provide the first direct evidence for an atherogenic activity of insulin-like growth factor II in vivo. Insulin-like growth factor II is a fetal promoter of cell proliferation that is involved in some forms of cancer and overgrowth syndromes in humans.

J. Intern. Med. 2000; 247: 349-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar). The disease is characterized by the formation of intimal fibrocellular lesions consisting of smooth muscle cells (SMC),1 inflammatory cells, lipid deposits, and extracellular matrix in arteries of large and medium size (2Ross R. N. Engl. J. Med. 1999; 340: 115-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (19370) Google Scholar). During the progression of atherosclerosis, inflammatory cells are recruited from the circulation, and SMC migrate from the underlying tissue into the lesion. Atherosclerotic lesions grow in size and complexity because of the proliferation and migration of these cell types and the deposition of extracellular matrix. Correlative and in vitro studies have implicated various growth factors in cell proliferation during atherosclerosis, but conclusive evidence for the involvement of individual moleculesin vivo is lacking (1Libby P. J. Intern. Med. 2000; 247: 349-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar, 3Celletti F.L. Waugh J.M. Amabile P.G. Brendolan A. Hilfiker P.R. Dake M.D. Nat.

The peptide insulin-like growth factor II (IGF2) is a fetal promoter of cell growth and differentiation acting mostly by autocrine or paracrine mechanisms (5Stewart C.E.H. Rotwein P. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 1005-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (698) Google Scholar,6Le Roith D. N. Engl. J. Med. 1997; 336: 633-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar). IGF2 is an important regulator of body size, because mice lacking IGF2 are viable dwarfs 60% the size of wild type animals (7DeChiara T.M. Efstradiatis A. Robertson E.J. Nature. 1990; 345: 78-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (1410) Google Scholar). IGF2 could play a major role in the growth of the atherosclerotic lesion, because it is involved in other human diseases associated with abnormal cell proliferation, such as cancer and overgrowth syndromes (8Toretsky J.A. Helman L.J. J. Endocrinol. 1996; 149: 367-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 9Morison I.M. Becroft D.M. Taniguchi T. Woods C.G. Reeve A.E. Nat.

Although representing an attractive candidate, IGF2 has received little attention in the study of atherosclerosis, and relatively more intense work has focused on the functionally and structurally related insulin-like growth factor I (IGF1) peptide (12Bayes-Genis A. Conover C.A. Schwartz R.S. Circ. Res. 2000; 86: 125-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). In the present work, we aimed at defining the importance of IGF2 in the growth of atherosclerotic lesions in vivo. To this end, we bred mutant mice lacking apolipoprotein E (Apoe nullizygous or Apoe−/−, where − indicates a disrupted allele), a widely used mouse model with a genetic predisposition to atherosclerosis (13Zhang S.H. Reddick R.L. Piedrahita J.A. Maeda N. Science. 1992; 258: 468-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (1849) Google Scholar), that were concomitantly homozygous for a disrupted Igf2 allele (7DeChiara T.M. Efstradiatis A. Robertson E.J. Nature. 1990; 345: 78-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (1410) Google Scholar). This cross showed how atherosclerosis develops in the absence of IGF2. We further analyzed the level of Igf2 RNA in the aortic tissue of Apoe−/− mice. In addition, we created novel mutant mice with targeted expression of anIgf2 transgene in the SMC. The latter mutation showed whether excess local IGF2 in the vascular tissue can reproduceper se any of the features of atherosclerosis. The contribution of these findings to elucidate the involvement of IGF2 in atherogenesis is discussed. Apoe nullizygous mice (generated in N. Maeda's laboratory, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, North Carolina and described in Ref. 13Zhang S.H. Reddick R.L. Piedrahita J.A. Maeda N. Science. 1992; 258: 468-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (1849) Google Scholar) were purchased from M&B (Ry, Denmark) and were the tenth generation of progressive breeding on to C57Bl/6J strain background. Igf2 nullizygotes were a generous gift from A. Efstradiatis (Columbia University, New York) (7DeChiara T.M. Efstradiatis A. Robertson E.J. Nature. 1990; 345: 78-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (1410) Google Scholar) and were at >10 generations breeding on to 129/J. DoubleApoe/Igf2 heterozygotes obtained by outcross were intercrossed to produce the experimental genotypes:Apoe−/−,Apoe−/−/Igf2−/−, wild type (normal Apoe and Igf2 alleles), and Igf2−/−. All mice analyzed in this study were therefore in a mixed genetic background. Typing of theApoe and Igf2 loci was performed by PCR of tail DNA with primers designed by us (details available upon request).K10igf2 heterozygous mice (K10igf2/+) were a kind gift from C. F. Graham (University of Oxford, UK) (14Ward A. Bates P. Fisher R. Richardson L. Graham C.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10365-10369Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) and were genotyped exactly as described (15Zaina S. Squire S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28610-28616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The crosses to obtain Apoe−/−/K10igf2/+ double mutants and control genotypes (Apoe−/−, wild type, andK10igf2/+) were similar to the one outlined above. Starting at 8 weeks of age, mice were subject to a Western-type diet (21% total fat, 0.15% cholesterol, without sodium cholate; AnalyCen Nordic, Linköping, Sweden) for 10 weeks. A 5.1-kb SalI (blunted)-EcoRI fragment including exons 4–6 of a mouseIgf2 genomic clone (a kind gift from P. Rotwein, Oregon Health Sciences University, Portland, OR) was ligated 3′ to the mouse α-smooth muscle actin gene promoter in pSMP8 (a kind gift from J. A. Fagin, University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, OH, and A. R. Strauch, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH; described in Ref.16Wang J. Niu W. Nikiforov Y. Naito S. Chernausek S. Witte D. LeRoith D. Strauch A. Fagin J.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 1425-1439Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar) digested with BamHI (blunted)-EcoRI following the insertion of a SpeI restriction site 5′ to promoter sequences by standard targeted mutagenesis. The resultingSmaigf2 transgene was excised as an 8.7-kbSpeI-EcoRI fragment and injected into pronuclei of F1 (C57BL/6 × NFR/N) fertilized eggs by standard techniques (17Hogan B. Beddington R. Costantini F. Lacy E. Manipulating the Mouse Embryo: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1994: 217-250Google Scholar). Mice were genotyped by PCR of DNA obtained from tails using primers designed by us (details available upon request). Nine of 63 screened mice were transgenic, and lines were established from five founders. Two lines named Isac and Igor showing the two most extreme phenotypes were kept for further characterization. Transgene heterozygotes at the fourth to the sixth generations of progressive breeding on to a C57BL/6 strain background were used to analyze the growth of the aortic vessel. Mice were subjected to the Western-type dietary regime outlined above for variable periods. Mice were sacrificed after an overnight fast. Following microscopic dissection of the heart and aorta, photographs of the ascending aorta and aortic arch were taken with a Yashica Dental-Eye III camera (Kyocera, Tokyo, Japan). Lesions were measured in whole mount thoracic aortas and in serial sections of the ascending aorta following staining with oil red O and hematoxylin as described (19Brånén L. Pettersson L. Lindholm M. Zaina S. Histochem. J. 2001; 33: 227-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 20Paigen B. Morrow A. Holmes P.A. Mitchell D. Williams R.A. Atherosclerosis. 1987; 68: 231-240Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (792) Google Scholar). Primary antibodies were mouse anti-PCNA (1:750; Sigma), fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-α-smooth muscle actin (1:500; Sigma), and rat anti-murine monocytes/macrophages (MOMA-2 antibody; BMA Biomedicals, Augst, Switzerland). Secondary reagents designed for primary mouse antibodies used on mouse tissue (Vector, Burlingame, California) including a peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody and a biotinylated rabbit anti-rat IgG (mouse absorbed, Vector, Burlingame, California) were employed for anti-PCNA and anti-murine monocyte/macrophage immunohistochemistry, respectively. Nuclei expressing (brown after developing with diaminobenzidine) or not expressing (blue counterstain with hematoxylin) PCNA were counted manually in printed digital images. In the case of the MOMA-2 antibody, the staining area (brown) was measured by computer-assisted morphometry in sections counterstained with hematoxylin. Controls with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated mouse IgG (Dakopatts, Älvsjö, Sweden) or in which the primary antibody was omitted were used for α-smooth muscle actin and PCNA, respectively. The vessels were fixed immediately after dissection in 3% cacodylate-buffered glutaraldehyde, postfixed in 1.5% cacodylate-buffered osmium tetroxide, dehydrated in ethanol, and embedded in Spurr epoxy resin. Thin sections were stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate and examined in a Philips CM120Twin electron microscope. To detect Igf2 RNA by RNase protection assay, a 277-bp template spanning the promoter-Igf2 junction in theSmaigf2 transgene including the first 15 bp of exon 2 of the α-smooth muscle actin gene and exon 4 ofIgf2 and flanked by the T7 and SP6 promoters (5′ and 3′, respectively) was constructed by PCR (details available upon request). An Igf2 antisense probe was synthesized from the SP6 promoter, designed to produce 167-nn (endogenousIgf2 and K10igf2 transgene) and 202-nn (Smaigf2 transgene) protected fragments (transcription reagents from Promega, Madison, WI). An antisense mouseGapd probe synthesized from a commercial template was used as an internal control (Ambion, Austin, TX). Radiolabeled probes were hybridized with total RNA and digested with RNases according to the Direct ProtectTM system (Ambion). RNA extracts fromIgf2−/− and wild type embryos or skin from K10igf2 transgenics (14Ward A. Bates P. Fisher R. Richardson L. Graham C.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10365-10369Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) were routinely used as negative and positive controls, respectively. A hybridization reaction including the undigested Igf2 probe and the unlabeled sense transcript synthesized from the same template with T7 RNA polymerase was included in all experiments to check the integrity of the probe. Double-stranded protected probe-protecting target RNA hybrids were separated on a nondenaturing polyacrylamide minigel and visualized by autoradiography. Detection of Igf2 RNA by reverse transcription-PCR was performed exactly as described (15Zaina S. Squire S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28610-28616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). A 117-bp template including exon 1 and the 5′ extreme 15 bp of exon 2 of the α-smooth muscle actin gene, flanked by the T7 and SP6 promoters (5′ and 3′, respectively), was constructed by PCR using pSMP8 as template (details available upon request). An antisense probe was synthesized from the SP6 promoter designed to produce a 63-nn protected fragment, and the assay was performed as described forIgf2 RNA. The α-smooth muscle actin andGapd RNA were quantified by analyzing a digital picture of the autoradiography film with the Kodak 1D Image analysis program (Eastman Kodak Co., Rochester, NY) for Macintosh. Total triglycerides and cholesterol were determined by colorimetric assays (Sigma). To measure very low density lipoprotein and high density lipoprotein, plasma was electrophoresed in a Sebia Hydragel Lipo gel (Medim Schweiz, Buochs, Switzerland), and lipids were stained with Sudan Black. Sample lipoprotein bands were scanned, and intensities were calculated relative to a human plasma reference run in the same gel. Insulin was determined by a double antibody radioimmunoassay technique using a guinea pig anti-rat insulin antibody,125I-labeled human insulin as tracer, rat insulin as standard, and goat anti-guinea pig IgG as secondary antibody (Linco Research, St. Charles, MO). The intra- and interassay CV was <3%. Glucose was determined with the glucose oxidase technique. Most of the parameters measured in this study do not unequivocally follow a normal distribution (21Guevara N.V. Kim H.-S. Antonova E.I. Chan L. Nat. Med. 1999; 5: 335-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Therefore, we compared pairs matched for sex and litter by the Wilcoxon paired test. Analyses were conducted using the Statview program (Abacus Concepts, Berkeley, CA) for Macintosh. Lesion sizes are reported as average with 95% confidence interval. For simplicity, the standard deviation is used in all other cases. The letter n indicates the number of pairs analyzed, unless stated otherwise. A gross inspection of the ascending aorta revealed that 18-week-old Apoe−/− mice subject to a Western-type diet for 10 weeks developed lesions at the origin, the lesser curvature of the arch, and the branching points as previously reported (Fig. 1A and Ref.22Park L. Raman K.G. Lee K.J. Lu Y. Ferran L.J. Chow Jr, W.S. Stern D. Schmidt A.M. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 1025-1031Crossref PubMed Scopus (1027) Google Scholar). By comparison, the corresponding lesions in mice with disruption of both Apoe and Igf2 alleles (Apoe−/−/Igf2−/−) were fewer and smaller (Fig. 1B). We measured the size of lesions at two different sites, e.g. the ascending and the thoracic aorta, by the inspection of serial sections and whole mount aortas stained with oil red O, respectively. The total surface of atherosclerotic lesions in whole mount thoracic aortas ofApoe−/− mice was 0.47 mm2 (95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.30–0.64, n = 14). Fatty lesions were detectable at branching points and on the luminal wall in Apoe−/− mice (Fig. 1, C andD, in duplicate). By contrast, the size of lesions in whole mount thoracic aortas ofApoe−/−/Igf2−/−mice was 0.09 mm2 (CI = 0.04–0.13, n= 14; Fig. 1, E and F, in duplicate), amounting to a nearly 80% reduction compared withApoe−/− (p = 0.0077). No lesion was detectable in aortas of Igf2 nullizygous (Igf2−/−) or wild type mice (n = 7 and 8, respectively; Fig. 1, G andH). A similar reduction of atherosclerosis inApoe−/−/Igf2−/−mice was revealed by a quantitative analysis of serial sections of an 800-μm-long segment of the ascending aorta. The average lesion area was 0.16 mm2 (CI = 0.11–0.30) inApoe−/− and 0.02 mm2 (CI = 0.005–0.05) inApoe−/−/Igf2−/−mice (p = 0.0201, n = 10). Mice lacking IGF2 are dwarfs with organs variably reduced in size (compare G with H in Fig. 1; Refs. 7DeChiara T.M. Efstradiatis A. Robertson E.J. Nature. 1990; 345: 78-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (1410) Google Scholar, 15Zaina S. Squire S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28610-28616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, and23Hassan A.B. Howell J.A. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 1070-1076PubMed Google Scholar). The reduced size of the aorta in dwarf mice lacking IGF2 could be a factor contributing to the decrease in lesion size observed inApoe−/−/Igf2−/−mice. Nevertheless, the size of lesions in both the thoracic and the ascending aorta was significantly different inApoe−/− andApoe−/−/Igf2−/−mice even after adjusting for the size of the vessel (Fig.2) or body weight (not shown). The histopathology of lesions in sections of the ascending aorta was qualitatively similar inApoe−/− andApoe−/−/Igf2−/−mice. Both groups developed intimal fibrocellular lesions containing lipid-rich cores and a layer of fibromuscular tissue on the luminal aspect. Lesions with a similar morphology were previously described inApoe−/− mice (21Guevara N.V. Kim H.-S. Antonova E.I. Chan L. Nat. Med. 1999; 5: 335-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). The reduced lesion size inApoe−/−/Igf2−/−mice may be due to a decreased cell proliferation or migration of SMC, because both processes are stimulated by IGF2 in vitro (5Stewart C.E.H. Rotwein P. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 1005-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (698) Google Scholar,24Gockerman A. Prevette T. Jones J.I. Clemmons D.R. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 4168-4173Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We studied the rate of cell proliferation and the abundance of SMC within lesions of Apoe−/− andApoe−/−/Igf2−/−mice by immunohistochemistry with antibodies specific for the PCNA and α-smooth muscle actin, respectively. In the case ofApoe−/−/Igf2−/−mice, only sections with relatively large lesions containing a sufficient number of cells to allow meaningful comparisons were included in the histological analysis. The frequency of cells expressing PCNA in lesions ofApoe−/−/Igf2−/−mice was 22.6+7.6% or nearly half the value measured in lesions ofApoe−/− mice (39.5 ± 5.9%,n = 8, p = 0.02). Cells expressing α-smooth muscle actin were abundant and densely packed around lipid-rich cores in Apoe−/− lesions (Fig.3, A and C). By contrast, α-smooth muscle actin was less abundant and present in sparsely distributed cells inApoe−/−/Igf2−/−lesions (Fig. 3, B and D). Although the staining in the media was generally weak, the fluorescence observed in lesions originated from genuine staining of α-smooth muscle actin, as shown by the control in which the fluorescent antibody was omitted (inset in upper left corner of Fig.3A). The α-smooth muscle actin was specifically decreased in lesions ofApoe−/−/Igf2−/−mice, whereas the medial tissue, which represents the majority of aortic SMC in the mice included in the present study (19Brånén L. Pettersson L. Lindholm M. Zaina S. Histochem. J. 2001; 33: 227-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), contained apparently normal levels of the polypeptide (Fig. 3B). Accordingly, RNase protection analysis of aortic RNA revealed only a slight reduction (∼5%) in α-smooth muscle actin transcript inApoe−/−/Igf2−/−compared with Apoe−/− mice (not shown). Preliminary results showed that monocytes/macrophages were abundant in lesions from both Apoe−/− andApoe−/−/Igf2−/−mice, with little difference between the two groups (not shown). The observation that Igf2transgenes have mainly local effects (5Stewart C.E.H. Rotwein P. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 1005-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (698) Google Scholar, 14Ward A. Bates P. Fisher R. Richardson L. Graham C.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10365-10369Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 25Bates P. Fisher R. Ward A. Richardson L. Hill D.J. Graham C.F. Br. J. Cancer. 1995; 72: 1189-1193Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar) suggests that IGF2 may promote cell proliferation in atherosclerotic lesions by autocrine or paracrine mechanisms. Accordingly, we detected Igf2RNA in aortas of eight of ten Apoe−/− mice tested by RNase protection assay or reverse transcription-PCR (Fig.4). This variability may reflect the broad distribution of lesion size (Fig. 2). Igf2 RNA generally declines to nearly undetectable levels in murine adult tissues and was not detected in wild type aortas (Fig. 4;n = 4). Furthermore, to study the effects of locally produced IGF2 on vascular cell proliferation, we created mice with a persistent supply of the peptide in blood vessels throughout adult life by targeted expression of an Igf2 transgene in SMC (Smaigf2 transgene; Fig. 4). The mouse α-actin smooth muscle promoter included in the Smaigf2transgene has been previously proven to correctly target transgene expression to the SMC (16Wang J. Niu W. Nikiforov Y. Naito S. Chernausek S. Witte D. LeRoith D. Strauch A. Fagin J.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 1425-1439Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 26Wang J. Niu W. Witte D.P. Chernausek S.D. Nikiforov Y.E. Clemens T.L. Sharifi B. Strauch A.R. Fagin J.A. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 2605-2614Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The size of the aorta and other organs rich in SMC was increased in transgenics belonging to two independent lines (Igor and Isac lines; Fig. 5,A and B). These effects were autocrine or paracrine, because Smaigf2 heterozygotes did not show any significant deviation from matched wild type mice in either body length (p = 0.136, n = 6 in the Isac line; p = 0.257, n = 6 in the Igor line) or tibial length (p = 0.102, n = 6, Isac line; p = 0.785, n = 6, Igor line) or wet weight of organs in which SMC are a relatively minor component, such as the tongue (p = 0.893,n = 7, Isac line; p = 0.50,n = 7, Igor line). These observations suggest that the increase in body weight observed in Smaigf2transgenics compared with wild type mice (Isac line: +22.6%,p = 0.102, n = 6; Igor line: +12.5%,p = 0.785, n = 6) was due to the disproportionate growth of organs rich in SMC. In addition,Smaigf2 heterozygotes belonging to both lines developed aortic focal thickenings that were present from the earliest age studied (8 weeks) on and were independent of dietary regime (n = 7; Fig. 5, B and C). No thickening was detected in any of the matched wild type aortas examined in this or other studies conducted in our laboratory (n= 15; Fig. 5A). Electron microscopy studies showed that these thickenings were intimal, consisted exclusively of contractile SMC, and contained no lipid deposits (Fig.6A; two randomly chosen sites on the aortic arch were sectioned, and four or five sections/site were examined in three Smaigf2 heterozygotes). Leukocytes adhering to the endothelial surface have been observed in only one section. By contrast, the intima of matched wild type littermates was normal, e.g. consisted of a monolayer of endothelial cells and lacked any SMC (Fig. 6B; n = 3). No obvious difference in the phenotype of medial SMC between wild type and Smaigf2 mice was detectable by electron microscopy. Smaigf2 heterozygotes had fasting plasma levels of cholesterol and triglycerides similar to wild type mice (not shown).Figure 6The aortic thickenings in mice with increased supply of IGF2 in the SMC are intimal.

To clarify the importance of systemic IGF2, we exploited mice with elevated circulating IGF2 as a result of expression of anIgf2 transgene controlled by the keratin 10 promoter (K10igf2 transgene; Ref. 14Ward A. Bates P. Fisher R. Richardson L. Graham C.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10365-10369Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Aortas of adultK10igf2 heterozygous mice had no detectableIgf2 RNA and showed no signs of intimal thickenings (n = 7; not shown). Accordingly, the growth of atherosclerotic plaques was not significantly increased by circulating IGF2, because mice that were Apoe−/− andK10igf2 heterozygous had lesions in the thoracic aorta of a size similar to Apoe single nullizygotes (0.53 mm2; CI = 0.30–0.77; n = 12;p = 0.8658 in comparison withApoe−/− mice). As previously reported, Apoe−/−mice showed hypercholesterolaemia, a mild hypertriglyceridaemia, an increase in very low density lipoprotein, and a decrease in high density lipoprotein (Table I and Ref.13Zhang S.H. Reddick R.L. Piedrahita J.A. Maeda N. Science. 1992; 258: 468-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (1849) Google Scholar). The absence of IGF2 ameliorated this dyslipidaemic profile. Fasting total cholesterol and very low density lipoprotein were reduced by 45 and 35%, respectively, inApoe−/−/Igf2−/−compared with Apoe−/− mice, and total triglycerides were at levels not significantly different from wild type (Table I). High density lipoprotein showed a tendency to increase inApoe−/−/Igf2−/−mice, although the difference with Apoe−/− was not significant (Table I). Thus, IGF2 significantly contributes to elevating plasma lipids in Apoe−/− mice. In addition, fasting plasma insulin levels were normal inApoe−/− mice as previously reported (22Park L. Raman K.G. Lee K.J. Lu Y. Ferran L.J. Chow Jr, W.S. Stern D. Schmidt A.M. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 1025-1031Crossref PubMed Scopus (1027) Google Scholar) but were nearly doubled and inversely correlated with triglyceride levels inApoe−/−/Igf2−/−mice (Table I; r = −0.833; p = 0.02;n = 7). The compensatory elevation of insulin levels might then underlie the reduced hyperlipidemia inApoe−/−/Igf2−/−mice. This increase in insulin levels was not a consequence of the lack of IGF2 per se, becauseIgf2−/− mice were normoinsulinaemic as reported (Table I and Ref. 27Lopez M.F. Dikkes P. Zurakowski D. Villa-Komaroff L. Majzoub J.A.

https://openalex.org/W2079695620,"Vascular permeability factor/vascular endothelial growth factor (VPF/VEGF) promotes its function primarily by activating two receptor tyrosine kinases, Flt-1 (VEGFR-1) and KDR (VEGFR-2). Recently, it has been shown that KDR is responsible for VPF/VEGF-stimulated endothelial cell (EC) proliferation and migration, whereas Flt-1 activation down-modulates KDR-mediated EC proliferation. Although KDR-mediated EC proliferation and migration have been extensively studied, much less is known about Flt-1-mediated antiproliferation. Here, we demonstrate that Flt-1-mediated antiproliferative activity can be blocked completely by the dominant negative mutant of CDC42 (CDC42-17N) and partially by a Rac1 dominant negative mutant (Rac1-17N) but is not affected by a RhoA dominant negative mutant (RhoA-19N). Both CDC42-17N and Rac1-17N increase the intracellular Ca2+ mobilization in response to VPF/VEGF but have no effect on KDR and MAPK phosphorylation. Using the chimeric-receptor EGLT in which the extracellular domain of epidermal growth factor receptor was fused to the transmembrane and intracellular domains of Flt-1, we also demonstrate that CDC42 and Rac1 are activated by EGLT. Previously, we showed that phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase is required for Flt-1-mediated antiproliferative activity, but phospholipase C is not required. As expected, CDC42 and Rac1 activation mediated by EGLT can be completely inhibited by PI3K inhibitors, wortmannin and LY294002, and the p85 dominant negative mutant but not by either the phospholipase C inhibitor, U73122, or an intracellular Ca2+chilator BAPTA/AM. Surprisingly, pertussis toxin and overexpression of the free Gβγ-specific sequestering minigene hβARK1(495) also inhibit EGLT-mediated CDC42 and Rac1 activation completely. Moreover, pertussis toxin treatment also increases the intracellular Ca2+ mobilization and inhibits the antiproliferation activity, thus suggesting that pertussis toxin-sensitive G proteins and the Gβγ subunits are involved in the signaling pathway of Flt-1 that down-regulates EC proliferation. Taken together, these results further expand our understanding of Flt-1-mediated antiproliferative activity in VPF/VEGF-stimulated endothelium.

Chem. 2000; 275: 16986-16992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar) and our laboratory show that one of the Flt-1 functions was to down-modulate KDR-mediated proliferation using two different VPF/VEGF receptor chimeric fusion systems (11Zeng H. Dvorak H.F. Mukhopadhyay D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26969-26979Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Our results further showed that the antiproliferative activity of Flt-1 was mediated through phosphotidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K), and that this activity was correlated with its effect on the intracellular calcium mobilization in VPF/VEGF-stimulated HUVEC (11Zeng H. Dvorak H.F. Mukhopadhyay D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26969-26979Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Barleon et al. (1Barleon B. Sozzani S. Zhou D. Weich H.A. Mantovani A. Marme D. Blood. 1996; 87: 3336-3343Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) show that pretreatment with pertussis toxin inhibited VPF/VEGF-stimulated macrophage migration. Based on the fact that macrophages express Flt-1 but not KDR, it was suggested that pertussis toxin-sensitive G proteins were involved in Flt-1-mediated macrophage migration in response to VPF/VEGF (1Barleon B. Sozzani S. Zhou D. Weich H.A. Mantovani A. Marme D. Blood. 1996; 87: 3336-3343Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because Flt-1 functions to down-modulate KDR-stimulated HUVEC proliferation instead of inducing HUVEC migration (11Zeng H. Dvorak H.F. Mukhopadhyay D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26969-26979Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar), the involvement of pertussis toxin-sensitive G proteins in Flt-1-mediated antiproliferative activity remains to be examined. The Rho family of the small GTPase superfamily has been shown to play an important role in cell growth, migration, transformation, and gene expression (12Aspenstrom P. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 95-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). The Rho family includes Rho (RhoA, RhoB, RhoC, RhoE, and RhoG), Rac (Rac1, Rac2, Rac3, and RhoG), CDC42 (CDC42Hs, G25K, and TC10), Rnd (RhoE/Rnd3, Rnd1/Rho6, and Rnd2/Rh07), RhoD, and TTF (12Aspenstrom P. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 95-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Among them, RhoA, Rac1, and CDC42 are the most extensively studied members of this family. RhoA primarily induces the formation of stress fibers, whereas Rac1 and CDC42 promote the formation of lamellipodia and filopodia, respectively, when they are expressed in cells (13Hall A. Science. 1998; 279: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (5199) Google Scholar, 14Machesky L.M. Insall R.H. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 267-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). It was reported that VPF/VEGF induces actin-based mobility (15Rousseau S. Houle F. Huot J. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 2000; 10: 321-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), suggesting that Rho family proteins might be involved in this response. However, there is no evidence of Rho family proteins playing a role in VPF/VEGF-induced cellular responses and whether VPF/VEGF activates these GTPases. In this study, we examined whether Rho GTPases are involved in the antiproliferative function of Flt-1. We found that a blockade of endogenous functions of CDC42 and Rac1 but not RhoA by their respective dominant negative mutants (CDC42-17N, Rac1-17N, and RhoA-19N) increases VPF/VEGF-induced HUVEC proliferation, indicating that CDC42 and Rac1 are involved in Flt-1-antiproliferative effect. In addition, overexpression of CDC42-17N and Rac1-17N increases VPF/VEGF-stimulated intracellular calcium release but not KDR and MAPK phosphorylation. Our results further demonstrate that Flt-1 stimulation activates CDC42 and Rac1, and that the activation of CDC42 and Rac1 is mediated through PI3K, free Gβγ subunits, and pertussis toxin-sensitive G proteins. Furthermore, the pretreatment with pertussis toxin increases VPF/VEGF-induced calcium mobilization and proliferation. Moreover, our data also indicate that there are two pathways for CDC42 activation, Rac1-dependent and Rac1-independent. The inhibition of the Rac1-dependent pathway by Rac1-17N partially inhibits CDC42 activation, resulting in partial inhibition of antiproliferation, but the inhibition of CDC42 completely prevented antiproliferation in VPF/VEGF-stimulated HUVEC. Recombinant VPF/VEGF was obtained from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). EGM-MV BulletKit, trypsin-EDTA, and trypsin neutralization solution were obtained from Clonetics (San Diego, CA). Vitrogen 100 was purchased from Collagen Biomaterials (Palo Alto, CA). Mouse monoclonal antibodies against the KDR C-terminal domain and rabbit polyclonal antibodies against CDC42 and Rac1 were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). [3H]Thymidine was obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Fura-2 AM and Pluronic F-127 were obtained from Molecular Probes (Eugene, Oregon). Pertussis toxin was obtained from Calbiochem. Primary HUVEC were obtained from Clonetics.

HUVEC transduced with EGLT were grown in the same medium without human EGF. HUVEC (passage 3 or 4) that were ∼80% confluent were used for most experiments. Cells were serum-starved in 0.1% fetal bovine serum in endothelial basal medium for 24 h prior to treatment. CDC42-17N, Rac1-17N, and RhoA-19N were kindly provided by Margaret M. Chou (University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA). The fragments encoding the genes were subcloned to a retroviral vector. The hβARK1(495) minigene was cloned by reverse transciption-PCR from HUVEC RNA and subcloned to a retrovirus vector (16Zhao D. Keates A.C. Kuhnt-Moore S. Moyer M.P. Kelly C.P. Pothoulakis C. J. Biol.

After 2 days, cells were serum-starved (0.1% serum) for 24 h and then stimulated with 10 ng/ml VEGF for 20 h. For the experiment with pertussis toxin, pertussis toxin was added to a final concentration of 100 ng/ml when cells were changed to serum-starved conditions. 1 μCi/ml of [3H]thymidine was added to each well, and 4 h later, cells were washed with ice-cold PBS three times, fixed with 100% cold methanol for 15 min at 4 °C, precipitated with 10% cold trichloroacetic acid for 15 min at 4 °C, washed with water three times, and lysed with 200 μl of 0.1n NaOH for 30 min at room temperature. [3H]Thymidine incorporation was measured in scintillation solution. Data were expressed as the values for stimulated cell relative to the mean for its control group. Data are expressed as the mean ± S.D. of triplicate values. 48 h after infection, HUVEC were serum-starved for 24 h and stimulated with 10 ng/ml of VPF/VEGF for various times. Stimulation was halted by the addition of ice-cold PBS, and cells were washed three times with ice-cold PBS and lysed with cold radioimmune precipitation buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.15 m NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm PMSF, 1 mmNa3VO4, 1 mm EGTA, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.5% aprotinin, and 2 μg/ml pepstatin A). Cell lysates were collected after centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. 1 mg of lysate protein was incubated with 1 μg of antibody against KDR for 1 h, and 50 μl of protein A-conjugated agarose-beads were incubated at 4 °C for an additional hour. The beads were washed with radioimmune precipitation buffer three times, and immunoprecipitates were resuspended in 2× SDS sample buffer for Western blot analysis. All experiments were repeated at least three times. Serum-starved HUVEC transfected with LacZ or CDC42-17N or pretreated with pertussis toxin for 16 h were loaded with Fura-2 AM and stimulated with 10 ng/ml of VPF/VEGF. Assay was carried out as described previously (11Zeng H. Dvorak H.F. Mukhopadhyay D. J. Biol.

The CDC42 and Rac1 activity assay was modified from Ren et al. (18Ren X.D. Kiosses W.B. Schwartz M.A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 578-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (1359) Google Scholar). The glutathione S-transferase (GST)-Pak-Rac binding domain (CRIB) fusion protein (19Bagrodia S. Taylor S.J. Creasy C.L. Chernoff J. Cerione R.A. J. Biol.

Bacteria were grown toA600 of 0.8 and induced with 1 mmisopropylthiogalactoside for 3 h. Bacteria were collected 50 ml/aliquot by centrifugation at 5000 rpm for 20 min and frozen at −80 °C. To prepare the GST-Pak-CRIB beads, each aliquot of frozen bacteria was resuspended in 2 ml of cold PBS, and 20 μl of dithiothreitol (1 m), 20 μl of PMSF (0.2 m), and 40 μl of lysozyme (50 mg/ml) were added and incubated on ice for 30 min. 225 μl of 10% Triton X-100, 22.5 μl of 1 mMgCl2, and 22.5 μl of DNase I (2000 kilounits/ml) were added. After additional incubation for 30 min on ice, the bacterial lysates were centrifuged at 10,000 rpm. The supernatant was incubated with 200 μl of glutathione-coupled Sepharose-4B beads (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) that were washed three times with bead-washing buffer (PBS with 10 mm dithiothreitol and 1% Triton X-100). After incubation at 4 °C for 45 min, beads were washed with bead-washing buffer for three times and resuspended in bead-washing buffer to give out 50% bead slur. GST-Pak-CRIB bound to Sepharose beads is approximately 1 μg/μl as detected by a protein assay kit (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA). 24-h serum-starved HUVEC with or without retroviral infection were stimulated with 10 ng/ml of VPF/VEGF or EGF at different time intervals. Stimulation was stopped by the addition of ice-cold PBS. Cells were washed with PBS three times and lysed with lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 0.8 mm MgCl2, 5 mm EGTA, 1% IGEPAL, 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 1 mm PMSF, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin). Cell lysates were centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 3 min. The supernatant was incubated with 50 μl of GST-Pak-CRIB beads at 4 °C for 45 min. Protein bound to beads were washed three times with AP wash buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm PMSF, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin) and analyzed by SDS-PAGE with antibodies against CDC42 or Rac1 as indicated. For inhibitor experiments, different concentrations of inhibitors as indicated with the exception of pertussis toxin were added 5 min before EGF treatment. Pertussis toxin was added 16 h before EGF treatment. All experiments were repeated at least three times. To examine whether the Rho family proteins CDC42, Rac1, and RhoA are involved in VPF/VEGF-stimulated HUVEC proliferation, we overexpressed the dominant negative mutants of CDC42 (CDC42-17N), Rac1 (Rac1-17N), or RhoA (RhoA-19N) using a recently developed retroviral gene-delivery system, which demonstrated an almost 100% infection yield in HUVEC to block the function of endogenous CDC42, Rac1, or RhoA (11Zeng H. Dvorak H.F. Mukhopadhyay D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26969-26979Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar, 17Zeng H. Sanyal S. Mukhopadhyay D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32714-32719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). HUVEC transduced with LacZ as a control, CDC42-17N, Rac1-17N, or RhoA-19N were serum-starved and stimulated with 10 ng/ml of VPF/VEGF. Proliferation assay was measured by the incorporation of [3H]thymidine. Data are expressed as -fold increase as compared with the non-stimulated control. Surprisingly, as shown in Fig. 1, the overexpression of CDC42-17N and Rac1-17N increases VPF/VEGF- stimulated [3H]thymidine incorporation by 50 and 25%, respectively, as compared with LacZ-expressed cells stimulated with VPF/VEGF. However, [3H]thymidine incorporation is not affected in VPF/VEGF-stimulated HUVEC transduced with RhoA-19N. The different effects of CDC42-17N, Rac-17N, and RhoA-19N are not attributed to the different levels of expression, because same amount of overexpressed CDC42, Rac1, and RhoA are detected by Western blot analysis (data not shown). These data indicate that CDC42 and Rac1 are involved in Flt-1-mediated antiproliferative effect in VPF/VEGF-stimulated HUVEC. It is known that VPF/VEGF stimulates KDR phosphorylation, intracellular Ca2+mobilization, and MAPK phosphorylation in EC (7Waltenberger J. Claesson-Welsh L. Siegbahn A. Shibuya M. Heldin C.H. J.

Therefore, we tested whether CDC42 and Rac1 play any role in the activation of these signaling molecules. Serum-starved HUVEC transduced with LacZ, CDC42-17N, and Rac1-17N were stimulated with VPF/VEGF for 0, 1, 5, and 10 min. Cellular extracts were immunoprecipitated with an antibody against KDR and immunoblotted with an antibody against phosphotyrosine. Fig. 2aclearly indicates that neither CDC42-17N nor Rac1 has any effect on KDR phosphorylation. Surprisingly, in a VPF/VEGF-stimulated intracellular Ca2+ mobilization assay, the kinetic slope and the maximum response of intracellular Ca2+ mobilization was increased in HUVEC transduced with CDC42-17N compared with that of those transduced with LacZ (Fig. 2b). The overexpression of Rac1-17N also increases the kinetic slope and maximum response of intracellular Ca2+ mobilization, however, the effects of Rac1-17N are less than that of CDC42-17N (Fig. 2b). However, MAPK was phosphorylated at the same level in HUVEC transduced with LacZ, CDC42-17N, or Rac1 after treatment with VPF/VEGF for different time intervals (Fig. 2c). Because the dominant negative mutants of CDC42 and Rac1 inhibit VPF/VEGF-stimulated HUVEC proliferation and intracellular Ca2+ mobilization, we tested whether VPF/VEGF directly activates CDC42 and Rac1. The activity of CDC42 and Rac1 was measured using a pull-down assay of GST-Pak-CRIB fusion proteins that bound only to the GTP-bound forms of CDC42 and Rac1 (19Bagrodia S. Taylor S.J. Creasy C.L. Chernoff J. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22731-22737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). Serum-starved HUVEC were stimulated with VPF/VEGF for various times. Cellular extracts were incubated with freshly prepared GST-Pak-CRIB beads. Proteins bound to the beads were subjected to Western blot analysis using the antibodies against CDC42 or Rac1. Fig.3, panel A, shows that CDC42 and Rac1 activity increases as early as 0.5 min and remains high at 1 min after VPF/VEGF treatment. To examine whether Flt-1 mediates VPF/VEGF-induced CDC42 and Rac1 activation, we used the recently developed receptor chimera, EGLT, in which the N-terminal domain of Flt-1 is replaced with that of epidermal growth factor receptor (11Zeng H. Dvorak H.F. Mukhopadhyay D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26969-26979Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). It was previously shown that HUVEC were not responsive to EGF treatment in the experimental conditions used (11Zeng H. Dvorak H.F. Mukhopadhyay D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26969-26979Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). As expected, in the HUVEC transduced with LacZ-expressing viruses, EGF did not activate CDC42 and Rac1 (Fig. 4, a andb, top panel). When serum-starved HUVEC transduced with EGLT-expressing viruses were stimulated with EGF for different time intervals, CDC42 and Rac1 were activated in a similar time frame as that in HUVEC stimulated with VPF/VEGF (Fig. 4,a and b, bottom panel).Figure 4EGLT-mediated activation of CDC42 inHUVEC. As described under “Experimental Procedures,” serum-starved HUVEC transduced with LacZ or EGLT were stimulated with EGF for different lengths of time as indicated. Cellular extracts were incubated with GST-Pak-CRIB beads. The bound proteins (activated form of CDC42 or Rac1) were analyzed with SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with antibodies against CDC42 (a, panel A) and Rac1 (b, panel A). a and b,panel B, cellular extracts were immunoblotted with antibodies against CDC42 or Rac1 to indicate a similar concentration of CDC42 and Rac1in each sample.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To identify the signaling molecules that mediate CDC42 and Rac1 activation, EGLT-expressing HUVEC were pretreated with an inhibitor of the phospholipase C family (U73122), PI3K inhibitors (wortmannin and LY294002), or BAPTA/AM, an intracellular Ca2+ chelator, for 5 min and treated with EGF for 1 min. Cellular extracts were used to measure the activation of CDC42 and Rac1. The data show that wortmannin and LY294002 completely inhibited both CDC42 and Rac1 activation, but neither U73122 nor BAPTA/AM inhibited CDC42 and Rac1 activation in EGF-stimulated EGLT/HUVEC (Fig.5a). To further confirm that PI3K is required for EGF-stimulated CDC42 and Rac1 activation in EGLT-transduced HUVEC, HUVEC were transduced with EGLT together with LacZ as control or a dominant negative mutant of PI3K, p85DN. Serum-starved cells were stimulated with EGF, and cellular extracts were subjected to CDC42 and Rac1 activation assay. As shown in Fig.5b, p85DN completely inhibited EGF-stimulated EGLT-mediated CDC42 and Rac1 activation. These results indicate that PI3K is a key mediator of EGLT-mediated CDC42 and Rac1 activation. It has been shown that pertussis toxin inhibited Flt-1-mediated microphage migration stimulated by VPF/VEGF (1Barleon B. Sozzani S. Zhou D. Weich H.A. Mantovani A. Marme D. Blood. 1996; 87: 3336-3343Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and suggested that pertussis toxin-sensitive G proteins may participate in Flt-1 signaling. Therefore, we examined whether pertussis toxin has any effect on CDC42 and Rac1 activation mediated by EGLT. Serum-starved HUVEC transduced with EGLT were pretreated with pertussis toxin overnight followed by stimulation with EGF for 1 min. Cellular extracts were subjected to CDC42 and Rac1 activation assay. As shown in Fig. 6, pertussis toxin completely inhibited the CDC42 and Rac1 activation mediated by EGLT. These data suggest that pertussis toxin-sensitive G proteins are involved in EGLT-mediated CDC42 and Rac1 activation. It is known that after activation heterotrimeric G proteins dissociate into α and βγ subunits, and the released βγ subunits from pertussis toxin-sensitive G proteins can trigger several downstream signaling pathways (20Gilman A.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 615-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (4700) Google Scholar, 21Hamm H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 669-672Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (934) Google Scholar). Therefore, to test whether Gβγ subunits are required for CDC42 and Rac1 activation, we overexpressed the hβARK1(495) peptide to sequester free Gβγ. hβARK1(495) corresponds to the C-terminal domain of human βARK1 that physically interacts with free Gβγ and therefore acts as a specific intracellular Gβγ antagonist inhibiting Gβγ-mediated downstream events (22Akhter S.A. Luttrell L.M. Rockman H.A. Iaccarino G. Lefkowitz R.J. Koch W.J. Science. 1998; 280: 574-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar, 23Koch W.J. Hawes B.E. Inglese J. Luttrel L.M. Lefkowitz R.J.

The transduced cells were then stimulated with EGF for 1 min. Cellular extracts were subjected to a CDC42 or Rac1 activation assay. The data show that overexpression of hβARK1(495) completely inhibits the activation of CDC42 and Rac1 (Fig. 7), indicating that Gβγ subunits are required for Flt-1-mediated CDC42 and Rac1 activation.Figure 7EGLT-mediated CDC42 and Rac1 activation required Gβγ subunits.EGLT-transduced HUVEC were traduced with LacZ or hβARK1(495). Serum-starved cells were stimulated with EGF for 1 min. Cellular extracts were incubated with GST-Pak-CRIB beads. Proteins bound on GST-Pak-CRIB beads (panel A) and cellular extracts (panel B) were analyzed with antibodies against CDC42 (top panel) and Rac1 (bottom panel).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Currently, our data indicate that both CDC42 and Rac1 activation are regulated by pertussis toxin-sensitive G proteins, free Gβγ subunits, and PI3K but not by phospholipase C or intracellular Ca2+. However, the effect of CDC42-17N on VPF/VEGF-stimulated HUVEC proliferation and intracellular Ca2+ mobilization is almost twice that of Rac1-17N (Figs. 1 and 2b). Therefore, we examined whether there was any cross-talk between CDC42 and Rac1. EGLT/HUVEC transduced with LacZ or Rac1-17N was stimulated with EGF for 1 min. Cellular extracts were subjected to a CDC42 activation assay. As shown in Fig.8a, Rac1-17N partially inhibits CDC42 activation. However, when EGLT/HUVEC transduced with CDC42-17N was stimulated with EGF and cellular extracts were subjected to Rac1 activation assay, CDC42-17N had no effect on Rac1 activation (Fig. 8b). These data indicate that Flt-1-stimulated CDC42 activation is mediated by Rac1-dependent as well as independent pathways. Next, we tested whether pertussis toxin has any effect on Flt-1-stimulated HUVEC proliferation and intracellular calcium mobilization in response to VPF/VEGF. Serum-starved HUVEC were pretreated with 100 ng/ml of pertussis toxin for 16 h and stimulated with 10 ng/ml of VEGF/VEGF. The data show that pretreatment with pertussis toxin increases the kinetic slope and the maximum response of VEGF/VEGF-induced intracellular Ca2+ mobilization (Fig.9a). We then examined the effect of pertussis toxin on Flt-1-mediated down-regulation of HUVEC proliferation. Serum-starved HUVEC were pretreated with 100 ng/ml of pertussis toxin for 16 h and stimulated with 10 ng/ml of VPF/VEGF for 24 h. As expected, the pretreatment with pertussis toxin increases the rate of VPF/VEGF-induced HUVEC proliferation (Fig.9b) at the same rate as that in HUVEC-transduced CDC42-17N (Fig. 1a) and p85DN (11Zeng H. Dvorak H.F. Mukhopadhyay D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26969-26979Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). It is known that KDR mediates cell proliferation and migration of EC in response to VPF/VEGF (7Waltenberger J. Claesson-Welsh L. Siegbahn A. Shibuya M. Heldin C.H. J. Biol.

Recently, with the chimeric receptors EGDR and EGLT, in which the extracellular domains were replaced with that of epidermal growth factor receptor, respectively, we found that EGLT cotransduction inhibited EGDR-stimulated HUVEC proliferation in response to EGF of up to 50% (11Zeng H. Dvorak H.F. Mukhopadhyay D. J. Biol.

Mukhopadhyay, unpublished data. increased the proliferation rate of approximately 50%. In this study, we show that VPF/VEGF-induced HUVEC proliferation is increased approximately 50 and 25% in CDC42-17N- and Rac1-17N-transduced cells, respectively. These data clearly indicate that CDC42-17N completely inhibits Flt-1-mediated HUVEC antiproliferative activity, but Rac1-17N partially inhibits this activity. Whereas the downstream pathway of CDC42 and Rac1 regulation of actin rearrangement has been extensively studied (24Matozaki T. Nakanishi H. Takai Y. Cell.

Recently, Jimenez et al. (35Jimenez C. Portela R.A. Mellado M. Rodriguez-Frade J.M. Collard J. Serrano A. Martinez A.C. Avila J. Carrera A.C. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 249-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar) reported that platelet-derived growth factor-stimulated CDC42 activation is independent of PI3K enzymatic activity but is dependent on the p85 regulatory subunit of PI3K. In this study, with the results of a pull-down assay we show that VPF/VEGF activates CDC42 and Rac1 in HUVEC, and that this activation is mediated by EGLT (i.e.Flt-1). Furthermore, CDC42 and Rac1 activation through EGLT (Flt-1) can be inhibited by PI3K inhibitors (wortmannin and LY294002) and p85DN, but not by U73122 nor by intracellular calcium chilator BAPTA/AM. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that Flt-1-stimulated PI3K is upstream of CDC42 and Rac1 activation that modulates KDR-stimulated intracellular calcium mobilization and cell proliferation. It was reported that pertussis toxin inhibited VPF/VEGF-stimulated microphage migration (1Barleon B. Sozzani S. Zhou D. Weich H.A. Mantovani A. Marme D. Blood. 1996; 87: 3336-3343Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because microphages express Flt-1 and not KDR, it was suggested that the Gi family proteins might play a role in Flt-1-mediated signaling (1Barleon B. Sozzani S. Zhou D. Weich H.A. Mantovani A. Marme D. Blood. 1996; 87: 3336-3343Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our result that pretreatment with pertussis toxin inhibits EGLT-mediated CDC42 and Rac1 activation further confirms the involvement of Gi family proteins in Flt-1 signaling. Pretreatment with pertussis toxin also increased the kinetic slope and maximum response of VPF/VEGF-stimulated intracellular Ca2+ mobilization in a similar way to the effect of overexpression of dominant negative mutants of CDC42 or PI3K (11Zeng H. Dvorak H.F. Mukhopadhyay D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26969-26979Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar) in HUVEC. The results indicate that Flt-1-induced PI3K, CDC42, and Rac1 activation is via pertussis toxin-sensitive G proteins. It is known that many responses mediated by pertussis toxin-sensitive G proteins are through the released Gβγ (20Gilman A.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 615-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (4700) Google Scholar, 21Hamm H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 669-672Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (934) Google Scholar). Our results show that Gβγ-sequestering peptide hβARK (495) completely inhibits Flt-1-induced CDC42 and Rac1 activation, indicating that Gβγ is the upstream mediator of Flt-1 signaling to CDC42 and Rac1 activation. It is known that Gβγ can activate PI3Kγ (36Servant G. Weiner O.D. Herzmark P. Balla T. Sedat J.W. Bourne H.R. Science. 2000; 287: 1037-1040Crossref PubMed Scopus (729) Google Scholar, 37Hirsch E.

Science. 2000; 287: 1040-1046Crossref PubMed Scopus (934) Google Scholar), but it is not known whether Gβγ can also activate PI3Kα and/or PI3Kβ, which use p85 as their regulatory subunits. Another possibility is that the p85 dominant negative mutant (p85DN) has some effect on PI3Kγ. Our results also indicate that overexpression of Rac1-17N inhibits CDC42 activation by ∼50%, but CDC42-17N has no effect on Rac1 activation. These findings indicate that the antiproliferative effect of Rac1 is mediated through its effect on CDC42 activation. This also correlates with the effect of Rac1-17N and CDC42-17N in VPF/VEGF-stimulated HUVEC proliferation and intracellular Ca2+ mobilization. Meanwhile, these data suggest that VPF/VEGF-induced CDC42 activation can be mediated through Rac1-dependent as well as independent pathways. Our results have demonstrated that both CDC42 and Rac1 activation in response to VPF/VEGF requires pertussis toxin-sensitive G proteins, free Gβγ subunits, and PI3K activation, indicating that VPF/VEGF-induced Rac1 and CDC42 activation is mediated by a common upstream signaling event. Although it has been shown that PI3K binds to Rac1 and CDC42 (27Kjoller L. Hall A. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 253: 166-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar), it is not clear how PI3K regulates Rac1 and CDC42 activity and how Rac1 triggers CDC42 activation. In summary, the current study demonstrates that CDC42 and Rac1 rather than RhoA mediate the antiproliferative effect of Flt-1. The effect of CDC42 and Rac1 is through reducing VPF/VEGF-induced intracellular calcium mobilization but not KDR and MAPK phosphorylation. Our results further demonstrate that Flt-1 stimulation activates CDC42 and Rac1, and that the activation of CDC42 and Rac1 is mediated through PI3K, free Gβγ subunits, and pertussis toxin-sensitive G proteins. Furthermore, pretreatment with pertussis toxin increases VPF/VEGF-induced calcium mobilization and proliferation. Together, our results extend the pathway that mediates Flt-1 down-modulated VPF/VEGF-induced HUVEC proliferation. The findings in this study significantly contribute to our understanding of how Flt-1 functions as an antiproliferative modulator during VPF/VEGF-induced vasculogenesis and angiogenesis."

The following materials were obtained commercially from the sources indicated. [35S]PAPS (1.9 Ci/mmol) was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences; GlcNAcβ1–6ManOMe, 6-O-sulfated GlcNAc, and 3-O-sulfated GlcNAc were from Sigma; GlcNAcβ1–2Man was from Dextra Laboratories (Reading, UK); GlcNAcβ1–6[Galβ1–3]GalNAc-pNP and GlcNAcβ1–3GalNAc-pNP were from Toronto Research Chemicals (North York, Ontario, Canada); and Streptococcus β-galactosidase and jack bean β-N-acetylhexosaminidase were from Seikagaku Corporation (Tokyo, Japan). GlcNAcβ1–3Galβ1–4Glc and GlcNAcβ1–3Galβ1–4GlcNAcβ1–3Galβ1–4GlcNAc were prepared from Galβ1–4GlcNAcβ1–3Galβ1–4Glc and Galβ1–4GlcNAcβ1–3Galβ1–4GlcNAcβ1–3Galβ1–4GlcNAc, respectively, by β-galactosidase digestion as described previously (13Uchimura K.

Commun. 1999; 263: 543-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), were used as templates for PCR to amplify truncated forms of GlcNAc6STs. To amplify the cDNAs encoding the truncated forms of GlcNAc6ST-1 lacking the first 35 amino acids, GlcNAc6ST-2 lacking the first 29 amino acids, or GlcNAc6ST-3 lacking the first 32 amino acids, 5′ and 3′ primer sets were used, respectively, as follows: a 5′ primer containing an in-frame EcoRI site (5′-TGGAATTCCTGCAGCAGTGCAACCCCGAT-3′) and a 3′ primer containing anEcoRI site (5′-GAGAATTCTTAGAGACGGGGCTTCCGA-3′); a 5′ primer containing an in-frame EcoRV site (5′-ATGTACGATATCCAACATCAGCTCCCTGTCT-3′) and a 3′ primer containing anEcoRV site (5′-CGAAGCGATATCCTTAGTGGATTTGCTCAGGGAC-3′); and a 5′ primer containing an in-frame EcoRI site (5′-CTGAATTCTCATCCCCAGCCGGCGGCGAG-3′) and a 3′ primer containing anEcoRI site (5′-CTGAATTCTCAGTCAGGCGATGCCCAGCT-3′). The amplification was carried out at 94 °C for 3 min with 35 cycles of 94 °C for 0.5 min, 56 °C for 0.5 min, and 72 °C for 1 min. The amplified fragments of GlcNAc6ST-1 and GlcNAc6ST-3 were subcloned into the EcoRI site of the fusion vector pcDSA (26Kojima N. Yoshida Y. Kurosawa N. Lee Y.-C. Tsuji S. FEBS Lett. 1995; 360: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) to yield pcDSA-GlcNAc6ST1 and pcDSA-GlcNAc6ST3, respectively. The amplified fragment of GlcNAc6ST-2 was digested with EcoRV and then subcloned into the blunted EcoRI site of the pcDSA. The obtained plasmid was named pcDSA-GlcNAc6ST2. In all cases, the plasmids encoded fusion proteins of GlcNAc6STs to the IgM signal sequence and protein A in the N-terminal region. COS-7 cells on 10-cm dishes were transfected with 4 μg of relevant plasmids using LipofectAMINE PLUS (Invitrogen) according to manufacturer instructions. After 24 h of culture in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, the medium was replaced with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 2% IgG-free fetal calf serum. The cells were cultured for an additional 48 h. Subsequently, the culture medium was collected, and the protein A fusion GlcNAc6STs expressed in the medium were adsorbed to IgG-Sepharose (10 μl of resin/10 ml of culture medium) at 4 °C for 3 h. The resin was collected by centrifugation and washed three times with Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline. Finally, the resin was suspended in 30 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and used as the enzyme. The standard reaction mixture contained 1 μmol of Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.2 μmol of MnCl2, 0.04 μmol of AMP, 2 μmol of NaF, 20 nmol of oligosaccharides, 150 pmol of [35S]PAPS (1.5 × 106 cpm), 0.05% of Triton X-100, and 1 μl of the fusion protein suspension in a final volume of 20 μl. After incubation at 30 °C for 1 h, aliquots of 2 μl of the reaction mixture were applied to TLC plates, which were then developed with ethanol-pyridine-n-butyl alcohol-water-acetate (100:10:10:30:3 (v/v)), and the radioactivity was visualized with a BAS2000 bioimaging analyzer (Fuji Film, Tokyo, Japan). For analysis of substrate specificity, half-aliquots of the reaction mixture were subjected to Superdex 30 gel chromatography to confirm the radioactivity of the35S-labeled products as described previously (13Uchimura K. Muramatsu H. Kadomatsu K. Fan Q.W. Kurosawa N. Mitsuoka C. Kannagi R. Habuchi O. Muramatsu T. J. Biol.

Digestion with jack bean N-acetylhexosaminidase and TLC of the products were performed as described previously (23Uchimura K. Fasakhany F. Kadomatsu K. Matsukawa T. Yamakawa T. Kurosawa N.

Sulfotransferase reactions of GlcNAc6ST-1, GlcNAc6ST-2, and GlcNAc6ST-3 toward various oligosaccharides analyzed in this study proceeded linearly up to 4 h under the standard assay conditions. Surgical specimens were obtained from two colon cancer patients during surgery and processed as described previously (27Kumamoto K. Goto Y. Sekikawa K. Takenoshita S. Ishida N. Kawakita M. Kannagi R. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 4620-4627PubMed Google Scholar). These cases were histologically diagnosed as mucinous adenocarcinoma. Malignant and non-malignant portions of the specimen were used for RNA extraction. Sample was frozen rapidly and stored at −80 °C until extraction of total RNA. The specimen was powdered in liquid nitrogen, and total cellular RNA was extracted with guanidine isothiocyanate and purified by cesium chloride gradient centrifugation. Cultured human colon cancer cell lines LS180 and LS174T, which have characteristics of mucinous adenocarcinoma (28Tom B.H. Rutzky L.P. Oyasu R. Tomita J.T. Goldenberg D.M. Kahan B.D. J. Natl.

Total RNA was isolated from 1 × 106 cells according to the acid guanidinium thiocyanate-chloroform extraction method using an Isogen kit (Nippon Gene, Tokyo, Japan), and the amount of RNA was quantitated by spectrophotometry at 260 nm. The first strand cDNA was synthesized by reverse transcription of the extracted total RNA (5 μg) using the first strand cDNA synthesis kit (Invitrogen) according to manufacturer protocol. One microliter of the retrotranscription reaction was subjected to PCR amplification using sulfotransferases primers. For detection of GlcNAc6ST-1 mRNA, the upstream primer 5′-CTTAAGGTCATCCACTTGGTGCG-3′ and the downstream primer 5′-GGGTCTTGCTGAGGTCTTTGACC-3′ were used. For GlcNAc6ST-2 detection, the upstream primer 5′-GCAGCATGAGCAGAAACTCAAG-3′ and the downstream primer 5′-TCCAGGTAGACAGAAGATCCAG-3′ were used. For GlcNAc6ST-3, the upstream primer 5′-CAAGACAGTGACAGTGCTCC-3′ and the downstream primer 5′-TACGTCCTGCTTGCTGATGG-3′ were used. The cycle numbers most suitable for semiquantitative RT-PCR were determined in preliminary experiments, i.e. 30 cycles for GlcNAc6ST-1, 35 cycles for GlcNAc6ST-2, and 30 cycles for GlcNAc6ST-3. As an internal control for the RT-PCR analysis, the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (G3PDH) transcripts were amplified from the same cDNA samples. The upstream and downstream for G3PDH genes were 5′-TGAAGGTCGGAGTCAACGGATTTGGT-3′ and 5′-CATGTGGGCCATGAGGTCCACCAC-3′, respectively. Aliquots of each reaction product were fractionated by electrophoresis through a 2% agarose gel containing ethidium bromide. The intensities of the bands were quantified by the Densitograph apparatus and software (AE-6920WLSA, ATTO, Tokyo, Japan). The production of 300.19 cells stably expressing l-selectin or E-selectin has been described previously (30Kansas G.S. Ley K. Munro J.M. Tedder T.F. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 177: 833-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). The interaction of 300.19/l-selectin cells was assayed in a parallel plate flow chamber (Glycotech, Rockville, MD). Monolayers of LS12 cells (19Kimura N. Mitsuoka C. Kanamori A. Hiraiwa N. Uchimura K. Muramatsu T. Tamatani T. Kansas G.S. Kannagi R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

LS12 cells are cloned ECV304 cells stably transfected with both GlcNAc6ST-1 and fucosyltransferase VII (Fuc-T VII) cDNAs and have previously been shown to significantly adhere to l-selectin-expressing cells in non-static monolayer adhesion assays (19Kimura N. Mitsuoka C. Kanamori A. Hiraiwa N. Uchimura K. Muramatsu T. Tamatani T. Kansas G.S. Kannagi R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4530-4535Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Cells were introduced into the flow chamber at a concentration of 106cells/ml in a buffer of RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 0.1% serum. The shear stress in the flow chamber was maintained constant at 1.0 dyne/cm2 using a syringe pump (Harvard Apparatus, Holliston, MA), and images were obtained using a Nikon Eclipse TE300-inverted microscope (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan). Data analysis was performed using Celltrak software developed by Compix (Cranberry Township, PA) as described previously (31Knibbs R.N. Craig R.A. Natsuka S. Chang A. Cameron M. Lowe J.B.

The time defined here is 0.5 sec. Velocities of individual rolling cells were also simultaneously obtained during analysis, and the mean rolling velocity of the rolling cell population was determined. The total number of rolling events and velocities were collected for 50–100 sequential images. Each experiment was repeated at least four times. COS-7 cells stably transfected with Fuc-T VII and/or GlcNAc6ST-1 were prepared using pRC/CMV-FT VII and/or pIRES1hyg-6ST-1 by employing methods similar to those described for ECV304 transfectant cells (19Kimura N. Mitsuoka C. Kanamori A. Hiraiwa N. Uchimura K. Muramatsu T. Tamatani T. Kansas G.S. Kannagi R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4530-4535Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Rolling assays for COS-7 transfectant cells were performed using the flow chamber as described by Lawrence et al. (33Lawrence M.B. Mclntire L.V. Eskin S.G. Blood. 1987; 70: 1284-1290Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), a syringe pump (Model 944, Harvard Apparatus), and an Olympus IX70−22FL/PH inverted microscope equipped with air-curtain incubator (Model IX-IBM, Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) at a constant shear stress of 1.0 dyne/cm2. The digital images were recorded with a digital video camera system (Model CS-220, Olympus). Expression of L-selectin ligands on the transfected cells was ascertained by flow cytometric analyses using the G152 antibody (murine IgM) specific to sialyl-6-sulfo-Lewis-X according to the methods described previously (19Kimura N. Mitsuoka C. Kanamori A. Hiraiwa N. Uchimura K. Muramatsu T. Tamatani T. Kansas G.S. Kannagi R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4530-4535Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). We compared enzymological properties of GlcNAc6ST-1, -2, and -3 to determine whether there are significant differences among the three enzymes. The activities of GlcNAc6ST-1 and GlcNAc6ST-2 were measured by using GlcNAcβ1–6ManOMe as a substrate, whereas core 2 was used as a substrate of GlcNAc6ST-3. GlcNAc6ST-1, -2, and -3 showed an optimum pH of approximately 7.5–8.0. GlcNAc6ST-3 activity was higher in sodium HEPES than Tris-HCl buffer, whereas GlcNAc6ST-1 and GlcNAc6ST-2 showed better activity in Tris-HCl buffer. With respect to the effects of divalent cations at a concentration of 10 mm, GlcNAc6ST-1 activity was stimulated 1.8-fold by the addition of Mn2+, whereas Mn2+ showed no effects on GlcNAc6ST-2 and inhibited GlcNAc6ST-3 to one-third of the activity without it. Ca2+ and Cu2+ strongly inhibited all three enzymes. Co2+ showed strong inhibitory effects on GlcNAc6ST-2 and GlcNAc6ST-3 but not on GlcNAc6ST-1. The Km value of GlcNAc6ST-1 for GlcNAcβ1–6ManOMe as an acceptor was lower than that of GlcNAc6ST-2 (TableI), indicating that GlcNAc6ST-1 has a higher affinity to mannosyl-linked GlcNAc residues than GlcNAc6ST-2. Km values for the core 2 oligosaccharide were the same between GlcNAc6ST-1 and GlcNAc6ST-2, whereas the value for GlcNAc6ST-3 was the lowest. GlcNAc6ST-1 had the lowest Km value for PAPS as the sulfate donor among the three enzymes (Table I). Both protein A-fused soluble GlcNAc6ST-1 and full-length GlcNAc6ST-1 as microsomal fractions of the cells transfected with pcDNA3-GlcNAc6ST showed the same enzymological properties, namely kinetical parameters and effects of pH and divalent cations (data not shown). Because microsomal fraction gave only weak activities of GlcNAc6ST-2 and GlcNAc6ST-3, production of the fusion protein became necessary to determine the activities of these enzymes precisely. Thus, fusion proteins were used to compare the properties of the three GlcNAc6STs.Table IComparison of KM values for sulfate acceptor and donor among GlcNAc6ST-1, GlcNAc6ST-2, and GlcNAc6ST-3SubstrateKMvalues1-aData are representative of one of two series of independent experiments, which exhibited essentially identical results.GlcNAc6ST-1GlcNAc6ST-2GlcNAc6ST-3mMmMmMGlcNAcβ1–6ManOMe0.21.14n.d.1-bn.d., not determined.GlcNAcβ1–6[Galβ1–3]GalNAc-pNP (core 2)0.410.410.2PAPS0.00121-cThe acceptor substrate was GlcNAcβ1–6ManOMe.0.00591-cThe acceptor substrate was GlcNAcβ1–6ManOMe.0.0141-dThe acceptor substrate was GlcNAcβ1–6[Galβ1–3]GalNAc-pNP (core 2).1-a Data are representative of one of two series of independent experiments, which exhibited essentially identical results.1-b n.d., not determined.1-c The acceptor substrate was GlcNAcβ1–6ManOMe.1-d The acceptor substrate was GlcNAcβ1–6[Galβ1–3]GalNAc-pNP (core 2). Open table in a new tab The series of oligosaccharides shown in TableII was tested as acceptors to evaluate the substrate specificities of GlcNAc6ST-1, -2, and -3. The TLC of 35S-labeled products revealed that both GlcNAc6ST-1 and GlcNAc6ST-2 utilized efficiently GlcNAcβ1–6Man, GlcNAcβ1–2Man, and core 2 oligosaccharide (GlcNAcβ1–6[Galβ1–3]GalNAc-pNP) as acceptors (Fig.1, Table II). As microsomal fractions of the cells transfected with the expression vector, GlcNAc6ST-1 showed the same specificity as that of the protein A-fused enzyme (data not shown). As compared with GlcNAc6ST-1, GlcNAc6ST-2 showed higher activity against GlcNAcβ1–3Galβ1–4GlcNAcβ1–3Galβ1–4GlcNAc. The most notable difference was that GlcNAc6ST-2 used core 3 oligosaccharide (GlcNAcβ1–3GalNAc-pNP) as an acceptor, whereas GlcNAc6ST-1 did not (Fig. 1 and Table II). In contrast, GlcNAc6ST-3 acted only on core 2 and did not act on GlcNAcβ1–6Man, GlcNAcβ1–2Man, core 3 oligosaccharide, or GlcNAcβ1–3Galβ1–4GlcNAcβ1–3Gal β1–4GlcNAc. Quantitative analysis revealed that both GlcNAc6ST-1 and GlcNAc6ST-2 utilized core 2 oligosaccharide, GlcNAcβ1–6Man, and GlcNAcβ1–2Man structures with similar velocities (Table II).Table IIComparison of the substrate specificities of GlcNAc6ST-1, GlcNAc6ST-2, and GlcNAc6ST-3 secreted into the culture medium by transfected COS-7 cellsAcceptorEnzyme activity2-aThe values represent the averages of two independent experiments. pmol/h/ml of medium (%)2-bThe percentage of the activity compared to that of GlcNAcβ1–6ManOMe is also shown.GlcNAc6ST-1GlcNAc6ST-2GlcNAc6ST-3GlcNAcβ1–6ManOMe20.6 (100)6.8 (100)N.D.2-cN.D. indicates <0.1 pmol/h/ml of medium.GlcNAcβ1–2Man26.3 (128)10.3 (151)N.D.2-cN.D. indicates <0.1 pmol/h/ml of medium.GlcNAcβ1–6[Galβ1–3]GalNAc-pNP (core 2)39.3 (191)9.9 (145)5.72-dThe actual observed radioactivities were approximately 30,000 cpm, whereas the assay without the enzyme or with IgG-Sepharose exposed to the culture supernatant of mock-transfected cells gave values <500 cpm.GlcNAcβ1–3GalNAc-pNP (core 3)N.D.2-cN.D. indicates <0.1 pmol/h/ml of medium.12.5 (184)N.D.2-cN.D. indicates <0.1 pmol/h/ml of medium.GlcNAcβ1–3Galβ1–4GlcNAcβ1–3Galβ1–4GlcNAc4.3d (21)5.0d (73)N.D.2-cN.D. indicates <0.1 pmol/h/ml of medium.2-a The values represent the averages of two independent experiments.2-b The percentage of the activity compared to that of GlcNAcβ1–6ManOMe is also shown.2-c N.D. indicates <0.1 pmol/h/ml of medium.2-d The actual observed radioactivities were approximately 30,000 cpm, whereas the assay without the enzyme or with IgG-Sepharose exposed to the culture supernatant of mock-transfected cells gave values <500 cpm.

https://openalex.org/W1987824814,"N-cadherin is a member of the classical cadherin family of homophilic binding molecules. Peptide competition studies have identified the HAVDI and INPISGQ sequences as functional binding motifs in extracellular domain 1 (ECD1) of N-cadherin. Whereas monomeric versions of these motifs function as specific N-cadherin antagonists, we now show that cyclic peptides containing a tandem repeat of the individual motifs function as N-cadherin agonists. In this context, when presented to neurons as soluble molecules, the dimeric versions of the motifs stimulate neurite outgrowth in a similar manner to native N-cadherin. The response to the dimeric agonist peptides was inhibited by monomeric versions of the same motif and also by recombinant N-cadherin ECD1 protein. The responses were also inhibited by antibodies to a fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) binding motif in ECD4 of N-cadherin and by a specific FGFR antagonist (PD17304). These data suggest that the peptides function by binding to and clustering N-cadherin in neurons and thereby activating an N-cadherin/FGFR signaling cascade. The novel agonists will be invaluable for dissecting out those cadherin functions that rely on signaling as opposed to adhesion and clearly have the potential to be developed as therapeutic agents for the promotion of cell survival and axonal regeneration.

Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 619-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (1251) Google Scholar). They underpin the formation of stable adhesive connections between cells, and this requires indirect binding to the actin cytoskeleton (2Gumbiner B.M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 399-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar). In some developmental situations, cadherins promote cell survival (3Hermiston M.L. Gordon J.I. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 489-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar, 4Peluso J.J. Pappalardo A. Trolice M.P.

Nature. 1988; 334: 62-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar), and synaptic plasticity (7Tang L. Hung C.P. Schuman E.M.

Neuron. 2000; 28: 245-259Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar), with some of these functions most probably depending upon the activation of intracellular signal transduction cascades in cells.In this context of cell signaling, regulated tyrosine phosphorylation is important for both the classical adhesive (9Matsuyoshi N. Hamaguchi M. Taniguchi S. Nagafuchi A. Tsukita S. Takeichi M. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 703-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar) and non-adhesive (10Williams E.-J. Walsh F.S. Doherty P. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 1029-1037Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) functions of cadherins. A functional interaction between a receptor tyrosine kinase and a cadherin was initially suggested based on the observation that neurite outgrowth stimulated by N-cadherin requires the activity of the fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR)1 in neurons (11Williams E.-J. Furness J. Walsh F.S. Doherty P. Neuron. 1994; 13: 583-594Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar). It has now been shown that N-cadherin and the FGFR associate with each other in several cell types (12Utton M.A. Eickholt B. Howell F.V. Wallis J. Doherty P. J. Neurochem. 2001; 76: 1421-1430Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 13Peluso J.J. Biol. Signals Recept. 2000; 9: 115-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 14Cavallaro U. Niedermeyer J. Fuxa M. Christofori G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 650-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). More recently, a novel functional motif that interacts with the FGFR has been mapped to extracellular domain 4 (ECD4) of N-cadherin (15Williams E.-J. Williams G. Howell F.V. Skaper S.T. Walsh F.S. Doherty P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43879-43886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Direct and/or indirect cadherin interactions with a wide range of receptor tyrosine kinases, including the epidermal growth factor receptor (16Hoschuetzky H. Aberle H. Kemler R. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1375-1380Crossref PubMed Scopus (669) Google Scholar), the c-Met receptor (17Hiscox S. Jiang W.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 261: 406-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), and the Ephrin A2 receptor (18Zantek N.D. Azimi M. Fedor-Chaiken M. Wang B. Brackenbury R. Kinch M.S. Cell Growth Differ. 1999; 10: 629-638PubMed Google Scholar), have also been reported. Likewise, cadherins can interact with both receptor and non-receptor tyrosine phosphatases, with protein-tyrosine phosphatase-1β and -μ binding sites recently mapped to the cadherin cytoplasmic domain (19Balsamo J. Arregui C. Leung T. Lilien J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 523-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar,20Brady-Kalnay S.M. Mourton T. Nixon J.P. Pietz G.E. Kinch M. Chen H. Brackenbury R. Rimm D.L. Del Vecchio R.L. Tonks N.K. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 287-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). In principle, regulated tyrosine phosphorylation could act upstream of the homophilic recognition step to modulate the prevalence, localization, or activation state of the cadherin in the cell membrane. Alternatively, regulated tyrosine phosphorylation might be a consequence of homophilic recognition and, under these circumstances, might serve to couple this event to a cellular response.In terms of the functional consequences of cadherins interacting with receptor tyrosine kinases, an interaction between N-cadherin and the FGFR has been implicated in both developmental and pathological processes. For example, neurite outgrowth stimulated by N-cadherin is inhibited by a wide variety of agents that inhibit FGFR function in neurons (11Williams E.-J. Furness J. Walsh F.S. Doherty P. Neuron. 1994; 13: 583-594Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar), including the expression of a dominant-negative FGFR (12Utton M.A. Eickholt B. Howell F.V. Wallis J. Doherty P. J. Neurochem. 2001; 76: 1421-1430Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar,21Saffell J.L. Williams E.-J. Mason I.J. Walsh F.S. Doherty P.

Neurobiol. 1998; 37: 633-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) and a recently developed FGFR antagonist (15Williams E.-J. Williams G. Howell F.V. Skaper S.T. Walsh F.S. Doherty P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43879-43886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). In addition, N-cadherin can promote “contact-dependent” survival of ovarian granulosa cells in an FGFR-dependent manner (23Trolice M.P. Pappalardo A. Peluso J.J. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 107-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). More recently, N-cadherin has been reported to promote the motility of cancer cells, with some data suggesting that the FGFR might be involved in this response (24Hazan R.B. Phillips G.R. Qiao R.F. Norton L. Aaronson S.A. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 779-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (746) Google Scholar, 25Nieman M.T. Prudoff R.S. Johnson K.R. Wheelock M.J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 631-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar). Whereas antagonists of N-cadherin have obvious therapeutic potential in terms of cancer, agonists have the potential to be developed as therapeutic agents that might promote cell survival and/or axonal regeneration.The fact that soluble forms of some adhesion molecules (26Doherty P. Williams E. Walsh F.S. Neuron. 1995; 14: 57-66Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), including N-cadherin (12Utton M.A. Eickholt B. Howell F.V. Wallis J. Doherty P. J. Neurochem. 2001; 76: 1421-1430Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), can promote axonal growth as effectively as membrane-tethered forms suggests that the development of small molecule agonists might be an attainable goal. In principle, this might be accomplished by using dimeric mimetics of natural binding motifs, as these would have the potential to dimerize cadherins (and any associated signaling molecules) in the cell membrane. In this context, the extracellular portions of the classical cadherins are composed of five repetitive domains, and a large body of evidence suggests that the homophilic binding site resides in the amino-terminal domain (ECD1) (27Shan W.S. Koch A. Murray J. Colman D.R. Shapiro L. Biophys. Chem. 1999; 82: 157-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 28Koch A.W. Bozic D. Pertz O. Engel J. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1999; 9: 275-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The fact that peptide mimetics of two linear sequences from ECD1 (HAVDI and INPISGQ) function as highly specific N-cadherin antagonists in a physiologically relevant assay (29Williams E.-J. Williams G. Gour B. Blaschuk O. Doherty P. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2000; 15: 456-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 30Williams E. Williams G. Gour B.J. Blaschuk O.W. Doherty P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4007-4012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) is consistent with the view that this domain contains key binding motifs. In this study, we have designed cyclic peptides that contain tandem mimetics of the above binding motifs. Our results show that, like native N-cadherin, these peptides can promote neurite outgrowth from cultured cerebellar neurons. Moreover, we show that, as with the response to native N-cadherin, the response to the peptide agonists requires the function of both N-cadherin and the FGFR in the responding neuron.DISCUSSIONMuch of the function of the classical cadherins depends on their ability to promote the stable adhesion of cells to each other. However, it is becoming apparent that simple adhesion models cannot readily explain the diverse functions of some cadherins. For example, N-cadherin has been implicated in a number of developmental events that range from promoting cell survival (3Hermiston M.L. Gordon J.I. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 489-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar, 4Peluso J.J. Pappalardo A. Trolice M.P. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 1196-1203Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) to controlling axonal growth, guidance, synapse formation, and synaptic plasticity (6Matsunaga M. Hatta K. Nagafuchi A. Takeichi M. Nature. 1988; 334: 62-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar, 7Tang L. Hung C.P. Schuman E.M.

Given our broader understanding of the function of adhesion molecules such as NCAM and L1 (40Walsh F.S. Doherty P. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 425-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar), it appears probable that some cadherin functions might be explained by their ability to activate signal transduction cascades in cells rather than by adhesion per se.One cadherin function that might be best explained by recognition and signal transduction is N-cadherin-stimulated neurite outgrowth. Evidence for this includes the observation that a soluble dimeric form of N-cadherin can stimulate neurite outgrowth as effectively as N-cadherin expressed in a transfected cell line (12Utton M.A. Eickholt B. Howell F.V. Wallis J. Doherty P. J. Neurochem. 2001; 76: 1421-1430Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). In principle, whereas a monomeric mimetic of a key binding motif might be expected to function as an antagonist, a dimeric version of the motif might have the potential to be developed as an agonist. In this context, putative binding sites within ECD1 of N-cadherin were originally identified based on peptide competition assays (31Doherty P. Rowett L.H. Moore S.E. Mann D.A. Walsh F.S. Neuron. 1991; 6: 247-258Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 41Blaschuk O.W. Sullivan R. David S. Pouliot Y. Dev. Biol. 1990; 139: 227-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). More recently, peptide mimetics of the INPISGQ and HAVDI sequences have been shown to inhibit N-cadherin-stimulated neurite outgrowth, with IC50 values of ∼15 and 65 μm, respectively (29Williams E.-J. Williams G. Gour B. Blaschuk O. Doherty P. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2000; 15: 456-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 30Williams E. Williams G. Gour B.J. Blaschuk O.W. Doherty P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4007-4012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Based on these observations, we conclude that ECD1 of N-cadherin contains at least two short linear binding sequences that contribute to the homophilic recognition process that leads to a neurite outgrowth response.Using a BIAcore approach, we have shown that ECD1 of N-cadherin can interact with itself. We have also shown that the recombinant ECD1 protein functions as a very active and specific N-cadherin antagonist, with an IC50 of <5 nm. The fact that the BIAcore interaction was best seen at protein concentrations that are higher than those required for inhibition of neurite outgrowth might be expected given the disordered nature of ECD1 when coated on a BIAcore chip relative to the ordered nature of N-cadherin in a cell membrane. Colman and co-workers (35Shapiro L. Fannon A.M. Kwong P.D. Thompson A. Lehmann M.S. Grubel G. Legrand J.F. Als-Nielsen J. Colman D.R. Hendrickson W.A. Nature. 1995; 374: 327-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (970) Google Scholar) have shown that the same recombinant ECD1 protein will form two distinct crystal dimers; one has the characteristics of a trans-adhesion dimer (Protein Data Bank code 1NCH), and the second has the characteristics of acis-dimer (code 1NCG). Interestingly, the HAVDI and INPISGQ sequences are both present at the trans-adhesion dimer interface revealed in the 1NCH crystal, where they interact in a reciprocal manner. Based on the above observations, the most parsimonious explanation of our data is that the peptide mimetics of these sequences function as antagonists by competing for natural binding sites that are present in ECD1 of N-cadherin. In support of this, molecular modeling has demonstrated that the antagonist peptides can adopt the same structure as the natural motifs present at the adhesion dimer interface that is formed between two ECD1 monomers (29Williams E.-J. Williams G. Gour B. Blaschuk O. Doherty P. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2000; 15: 456-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar,30Williams E. Williams G. Gour B.J. Blaschuk O.W. Doherty P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4007-4012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Structural and biochemical studies point to additional ways in which classical cadherins might form both cis- andtrans-dimers (28Koch A.W. Bozic D. Pertz O. Engel J. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1999; 9: 275-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), and two recent reports have suggested that cadherin-mediated adhesion might involve an overlap of all the cadherin domains (36Chappuis-Flament S. Wong E. Hicks L.D. Kay C.M. Gumbiner B.M. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 231-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 42Sivasankar S. Gumbiner B. Leckband D. Biophys. J. 2001; 80: 1758-1768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). It is perhaps worth noting that we have been unable to inhibit the binding of a neuronal cell line to purified N-cadherin using the above peptides at relatively high concentrations. 2F. V. Howell and P. Doherty, unpublished data. This tends to support the view that there might be fundamental differences in the way that cadherins interact with each other in a transient manner as opposed to a stable manner, and this might explain in part the lack of congruence in the structural and biochemical studies. Nonetheless, our studies with peptide antagonists lend support to the view that thetrans-adhesion interface revealed in the 1NCH crystal dimer is a biologically relevant interface, albeit with the caveat that our studies speak only to the homophilic recognition that promotes an axonal growth response.If the dimeric versions of the above peptide antagonists can bind to their “natural” binding sites as revealed in thetrans-crystal dimer, they might be expected to promote the dimerization of cadherins in the cell. In principle, the peptides might dimerize cadherin monomers and/or pre-existing cis-dimers, as the cis-dimerization face is on the opposite side of the molecule to the proposed peptide binding sites (35Shapiro L. Fannon A.M. Kwong P.D. Thompson A. Lehmann M.S. Grubel G. Legrand J.F. Als-Nielsen J. Colman D.R. Hendrickson W.A. Nature. 1995; 374: 327-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (970) Google Scholar). Based on the above hypothesis, we have tested dimeric forms of both the HAVDI and INPISG sequences for their ability to function as N-cadherin agonists. We designed peptides that contained the motifs in an antiparallel manner, as our molecular modeling studies suggested that this orientation would be required for the simultaneous engagement of two cadherin units. Our results have shown that cyclic peptides containing dimeric HAVDI and INPISG motifs (N-Ac-CHAVDINGHAVDIC-NH2 andN-Ac-CINPISGINPISGC-NH2) can promote neurite outgrowth; and in the case of the HAVDI agonist peptide, the response was almost as good as that stimulated by native N-cadherin. As a control, we have shown that when both peptides are presented to neurons as linear rather than cyclic peptides, they do not stimulate neurite outgrowth. This was to be expected given the fact that the molecular modeling showed that the disulfide bond within each active peptide can constrain the structure in a manner that would be expected to facilitate the interaction of one peptide with two cadherin molecules. The observation that the response to the peptides is biphasic might be explained by monomeric binding dominating dimeric binding at higher peptide concentrations. However, it might also be related to the fact that the FGFR signal transduction cascade (which is required for the peptide response; see below) is biphasic, with higher levels of activation inhibiting neurite outgrowth (43Williams E.-J. Furness J. Walsh F.S. Doherty P. Development. 1994; 120: 1685-1693Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 44Williams E.-J. Mittal B. Walsh F.S. Doherty P. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 3523-3530PubMed Google Scholar).Four lines of evidence suggest that an interaction with N-cadherin is required for the neurite outgrowth response stimulated by the dimeric HAVDI and INISGQ peptides. First, the response to each peptide is inhibited by monomeric mimetics of the corresponding motif, and these have previously been established to function as specific N-cadherin antagonists (29Williams E.-J. Williams G. Gour B. Blaschuk O. Doherty P. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2000; 15: 456-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 30Williams E. Williams G. Gour B.J. Blaschuk O.W. Doherty P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4007-4012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Second, the recombinant ECD1 protein of N-cadherin inhibits the agonist peptide responses, suggesting that they share a common cellular binding site. In this context, a considerable body of evidence points to ECD1 of cellular N-cadherin as the best candidate binding site for the recombinant protein (27Shan W.S. Koch A. Murray J. Colman D.R. Shapiro L. Biophys. Chem. 1999; 82: 157-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), and it follows that this must also be considered as the best candidate binding site for the agonist peptides. Given the molar ratio of the peptides to the soluble ECD1 protein (∼300:1), we can conclude that ECD1 competes for peptide binding to a cellular site as opposed to acting as a soluble sink for the peptides in solution. The absolute site of interaction with the peptides would clearly be best resolved by direct observation (e.g. crystallography). However, the interaction affinity is likely to preclude this. Nonetheless, synthetic peptides can be viewed as a starting point for the development of non-peptide mimetics, with the latter being much more useful tools for the direct binding studies. Third, the neurite outgrowth response to each agonist peptide is inhibited by a monovalent F(ab′) fraction of an antiserum that reacts specifically with a small motif in ECD4 of N-cadherin. This reagent inhibits the neurite outgrowth response stimulated by native N-cadherin in the absence of any effect on neurite outgrowth stimulated by a range of other molecules (15Williams E.-J. Williams G. Howell F.V. Skaper S.T. Walsh F.S. Doherty P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43879-43886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Recent evidence suggests that the site in ECD4 that is targeted by the antibody plays a role in acis-interaction between N-cadherin and the FGFR rather than a direct role in homophilic binding (15Williams E.-J. Williams G. Howell F.V. Skaper S.T. Walsh F.S. Doherty P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43879-43886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The observation that this antibody inhibits the response to peptides that presumably bind to ECD1 provides additional evidence that ECD4 has a function that can be dissociated from conventional homophilic binding (45Kim J.B. Islam S. Kim Y.J. Prudoff R.S. Sass K.M. Wheelock M.J. Johnson K.R. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 1193-1206Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Fourth, neurite outgrowth stimulated by native N-cadherin requires FGFR function in the neuron (11Williams E.-J. Furness J. Walsh F.S. Doherty P. Neuron. 1994; 13: 583-594Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar, 21Saffell J.L. Williams E.-J. Mason I.J. Walsh F.S. Doherty P.

Neurobiol. 1998; 37: 633-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). We have shown that a highly specific FGFR antagonist (PD17304) inhibits the agonist peptide responses. It is perhaps worth noting that, at the concentration used, this inhibitor fully blocks the response stimulated by FGF2 and native N-cadherin (15Williams E.-J. Williams G. Howell F.V. Skaper S.T.

The possibility that the agonist peptides act directly at the level of the FGFR can be discounted, as the response to FGF2 is not inhibited by several of the agents that inhibit the peptide response (e.g. the anti-N-cadherin ECD4 antibody).In summary, we have demonstrated the feasibility of the rational design of small molecule N-cadherin agonists. In doing so, we have provided further evidence that the HAVDI and INPISG motifs in ECD1 of N-cadherin are functional binding motifs. There appears to be no reason why the same rationale cannot be employed for the design of other cadherin agonists. The novel reagents will be invaluable tools for dissecting out those cadherin functions that rely solely on signaling from those that rely on adhesion and will help resolve issues relating to the signaling pathways that are activated by cadherins. The transmembrane glycoproteins of the classical cadherin family are homophilic binding molecules that mediate cellular recognition in numerous developmental contexts (1Takeichi M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 619-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (1251) Google Scholar). They underpin the formation of stable adhesive connections between cells, and this requires indirect binding to the actin cytoskeleton (2Gumbiner B.M. J.

In this context of cell signaling, regulated tyrosine phosphorylation is important for both the classical adhesive (9Matsuyoshi N. Hamaguchi M. Taniguchi S. Nagafuchi A. Tsukita S. Takeichi M. J.

A functional interaction between a receptor tyrosine kinase and a cadherin was initially suggested based on the observation that neurite outgrowth stimulated by N-cadherin requires the activity of the fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR)1 in neurons (11Williams E.-J. Furness J. Walsh F.S. Doherty P. Neuron. 1994; 13: 583-594Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar). It has now been shown that N-cadherin and the FGFR associate with each other in several cell types (12Utton M.A. Eickholt B. Howell F.V. Wallis J. Doherty P. J.

The retinoblastoma tumor suppressor (RB) and mismatch repair complexes are known to contribute to the appropriate cellular response to specific types of DNA damage. However, the signaling pathways through which these proteins impact the cell cycle machinery have not been explicitly determined. RB-deficient murine embryo fibroblasts continued a high degree of DNA replication following the induction of cisplatin damage, but were inhibited for G2/M progression. This damage led to RB dephosphorylation/activation and subsequent RB-dependent attenuation of cyclin A and CDK2 activity. In both Rb+/+ and Rb−/− cells, cyclin D1 expression was attenuated following DNA damage. As cyclin D1 is a critical determinant of RB phosphorylation and cell cycle progression, we probed the pathway through which cyclin D1 degradation occurs in response to DNA damage. We found that attenuation of endogenous cyclin D1 is dependent on multiple mismatch repair proteins. We demonstrate that the mismatch repair-dependent attenuation of endogenous cyclin D1 is critical for attenuation of CDK2 activity and induction of cell cycle checkpoints. Together, these studies couple the activity of the retinoblastoma and mismatch repair tumor suppressor pathways through the degradation of cyclin D1 and dual attenuation of CDK2 activity.

It is postulated that genetic damage is sensed by specific proteins which initiate signal transduction pathways to inhibit cell cycle progression. Cell cycle transitions are driven by the coordinated activity of cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK)1 cyclin complexes. Mitogens stimulate the expression of cyclin D and the subsequent activation of CDK4-cyclin D complexes (6Sherr C.J. Science. 1996; 274: 1672-1677Crossref PubMed Scopus (4977) Google Scholar). These cyclin D-associated complexes initiate the phosphorylation of RB, which disrupts RB-mediated transcriptional repression of specific target genes allowing progression through G1 (7Harbour J.W. Luo R.X. Dei Santi A. Postigo A.A. Dean D.C. Cell. 1999; 98: 859-869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (827) Google Scholar, 8Mittnacht S. Curr. Opin. Genet.

It is believed that the targets for RB are encompassed by a host of E2F-regulated genes, including metabolic enzymes and cyclins E and A (10Dyson N. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2245-2262Crossref PubMed Scopus (1971) Google Scholar, 11Nevins J.R. Leone G. DeGregori J. Jakoi L. J. Cell. Physiol. 1997; 173: 233-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Since the activity of these cyclins is required for cell cycle progression, RB phosphorylation/inactivation is requisite for passage into S-phase. Subsequent activation of CDC2-cyclin B complexes is required for mitotic entry. Importantly, numerous participants in checkpoint processes are implicated in tumor development/progression. In fact, RB is a critical cell cycle regulator that has recently been shown to participate in the cellular response to DNA damage (12Brugarolas J. Bronson R.T. Jacks T. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 503-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 13Harrington E.A. Bruce J.L. Harlow E. Dyson N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biol. 2000; 201: 7751-7763Crossref Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Environmental stresses such as DNA damage prevent RB phosphorylation, thus leading to RB-dependent cessation of cell cycle progression. For example, RB is dephosphorylated/activated when primary fibroblasts are exposed to ionizing radiation, and this event triggers cell cycle arrest (13Harrington E.A. Bruce J.L. Harlow E. Dyson N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11945-11950Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Our laboratory has previously shown that the role of RB is also conserved in the replicative checkpoint response to cisplatin (cis-diaminedichloroplatinum-II: CDDP) (13Harrington E.A. Bruce J.L. Harlow E. Dyson N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11945-11950Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 14Knudsen K.E. Booth D. Naderi S. Sever-Chroneos Z. Fribourg A.F. Hunton I.

However, the full spectrum of RB-dependent checkpoints and the mechanism through which RB is activated and then exerts its cell cycle inhibitory effects in response to DNA damage are not clearly delineated. Here we assessed the mechanism through which CDDP-mediated DNA damage signals through RB to elicit checkpoint responses. We find that RB is required for the cessation of G1- and S-phase progression in primary fibroblasts. However, RB is dispensable for the G2/M block instilled by CDDP. Analysis of the mechanism through which RB inhibits G1/S demonstrated that RB is required for the attenuation of cyclin A expression and CDK2-associated kinase activity following CDDP damage. Analysis of upstream signaling demonstrated that CDDP damage mediates loss of cyclin D1 expression irrespective of RB, suggesting that this response may be critical for the initiation of the RB-dependent checkpoint. Analysis of multiple pathways indicated that the degradation of cyclin D1 is dependent on the mismatch repair complex. This mismatch repair-dependent degradation of cyclin D1 was critical for appropriate checkpoint response, RB activation or reduction in CDK2 activity. Importantly, mismatch repair activities function as tumor suppressors (15Kolodner R.D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 397-401Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar, 16Fishel R.

Adenoviral infections were carried out at a calculated multiplicity of infection of 50–100, actual infection efficiency was greater than 95% as determined by GFP fluorescence. Pharmaceutical cisplatin (Bristol Oncology) was applied at the given concentration for the indicated time period. Nocodazole was used at 0.4 μg/ml. Mitomycin C, etoposide, and doxorubicin were from Sigma. BrdUrd incorporation was determined as previously described (29Knudsen E.S. Buckmaster C. Chen T.T. Feramisco J.R. Wang J.Y. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2278-2292Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). In all experiments the percentage of BrdUrd-positive cells was determined as the percentage of Hoechst-stained nuclei which were BrdUrd positive. For the analysis of mitotic chromosome condensation, cells were treated with the indicated dose of cisplatin for 16 h. CDDP was then washed from the media and the cells were allowed to progress for 6–8 h in the presence of nocadazole to increase the numbers of mitotic cells. Both adherent and floating cells were harvested, fixed, and stained with Hoecsht. Mitotic nuclei were readily apparent through microscopic analysis of the stained nuclei. The detection of RB in MEFs was as previously described (14Knudsen K.E. Booth D. Naderi S. Sever-Chroneos Z. Fribourg A.F. Hunton I. Feramisco J.R. Wang J.Y.J. Knudsen E.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 201: 7751-7763Crossref Scopus (200) Google Scholar). The immunoblotting and immunoprecipitations for cyclins, CDKs, and inhibitors were carried out by standard protocols. The CDK4 (H-22), CDK2 (M-2), cyclin E (C-19), and cyclin A (C-19 and H432) antibodies were procured from Santa Cruz. The cyclin D1 (Ab-3) antibody was obtained from Neo-markers. CDK2-kinase assays against histone H1 were carried using anti-CDK2 antibody, as previously described (29Knudsen E.S. Buckmaster C. Chen T.T. Feramisco J.R. Wang J.Y. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2278-2292Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Cells were fixed with 80% ethanol and processed for propidium iodide staining, as previously described (30Knudsen E.S. Wang J.Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5771-5783Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). For bivariate analyses, cells were fixed with ethanol and stained for BrdUrd incorporation and propidium iodide staining (14Knudsen K.E. Booth D. Naderi S. Sever-Chroneos Z. Fribourg A.F. Hunton I. Feramisco J.R. Wang J.Y.J. Knudsen E.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 201: 7751-7763Crossref Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Flow cytometry was performed on a Coulter Epic flow cytometer. Statistical analysis of the flow cytometry data was carried out blind. DNA damage elicits cell cycle checkpoints in multiple phases of the cell cycle. To evaluate the requirement for RB in cell cycle checkpoints elicited upon CDDP-mediated damage, primary murine embryo fibroblasts (MEFs) with varying RB status were utilized. CDDP induces striking G1, S-phase, and G2/M checkpoints, and thus enables one to investigate a variety of checkpoints through the use of a single agent. Therefore, asynchronously growing wild-type (Rb+/+) or RB-deficient (Rb−) MEFs were treated with 32 μm CDDP for 16 h. These cells were then labeled for 8 h with BrdUrd and scored for the ability to incorporate BrdUrd (Fig.1 A). In wild-type MEFs, treatment with CDDP dramatically inhibited BrdUrd incorporation (Fig.1 A). In contrast, CDDP had virtually no influence on BrdUrd incorporation in Rb− cells (Fig. 1 A). To determine the role of RB on cell cycle phase transitions following CDDP exposure, we employed bivariate flow cytometry (Fig. 1 B). Using this approach, incorporation of BrdUrd (an indicator of DNA replication) and DNA content (an indicator of cell cycle phase) were measured concurrently. Asynchronously growing cells were treated with 32 μm CDDP and then pulse labeled with BrdUrd for 1 h. During the pulse labeling, only cells in S-phase of the cell cycle will incorporate BrdUrd. Untreated Rb+/+ and Rb−/− cells readily incorporated BrdUrd in S-phase (Fig. 1 B). CDDP treatment inhibited BrdUrd incorporation and therefore DNA-replication of Rb+/+ cells. Rb+/+ cells that had already entered S-phase (DNA content between 2N and 4N) failed to incorporate BrdUrd and complete DNA replication, thus CDDP damage inhibited S-phase progression. Furthermore, following CDDP treatment Rb+/+ cells fail to accumulate in any phase of the cell cycle, indicating that CDDP initiated arrest in G1/S, S, and G2/M phases of the cell cycle. In contrast, Rb−/− cells continued to incorporate BrdUrd following CDDP treatment (Fig. 1 B). Importantly, the Rb−/− cells were able to complete DNA replication, as indicated by the increase in cells with a 4N DNA content. Strikingly, the Rb−/− cells continue replication without apparently progressing through cytokinesis, as indicated by the accumulation of cells with a DNA content greater than 4N. To explicitly investigate the role of RB in the G2/M transition, we treated asynchronously growing Rb+/+ or Rb−/− MEFs with 32 μm CDDP followed by incubation with nocadazole (0.4 μg/ml) to enrich for mitotic cells (Fig. 1 C). Approximately 15% of Rb+/+ and Rb−/− untreated cells were mitotic following enrichment with nocadazole. In contrast, following CDDP treatment, less than 1% of either Rb+/+ or Rb−/− nuclei exhibit mitotic condensation (Fig. 1 C). Therefore, CDDP blocks the G2/M transition irrespective of RB status. While these data demonstrate a role for RB in the G1 and S-phase DNA damage checkpoints, the pathway for this action of RB was not known. As expected, treatment with 32 μm CDDP leads to the dephosphorylation/activation of the endogenous RB protein present in MEFs (Fig. 2 A). The expression of cyclin E, CDK2, and cyclin A are proposed to be regulated by RB/E2F. Therefore, we analyzed the influence of RB status on the levels of these proteins following treatment with CDDP. Consistent with prior results, we observed increased levels of cyclin E protein in the Rb−/− cells (31Herrera R.E. Sah V.P. Williams B.O. Meakelea T.P. Weinberg R.A. Jacks T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2402-2407Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2 B). Surprisingly, cyclin E protein levels were not altered in Rb+/+ cells after CDDP treatment (Fig.2 B). This finding suggested, that the active RB in these cells does not act by further attenuating cyclin E. In contrast, cyclin A protein expression was inhibited in CDDP-treated Rb+/+ MEFs, but not in the Rb−/− MEFs (Fig. 2 B). The attenuation of cyclin A was also observed at 16 μm CDDP (Fig. 2 C), a dose of CDDP at which RB is dephosphorylated and there is an RB-dependent checkpoint (not shown). Together, these results indicate that the inhibition of cyclin A expression requires functional RB and correlates with the checkpoint elicited by CDDP. We also determined the CDK2 kinase activity in Rb+/+ and Rb−/− MEFs, in the presence or absence of CDDP. We found that CDK2 kinase activity is decreased in Rb+/+ MEFs after CDDP treatment (Fig. 2 D). In Rb−/− cells that express high levels of cyclin E and cyclin A even in the presence of CDDP, CDK2 kinase activity was not changed by CDDP addition (Fig. 2 D). To determine whether the reduction in cyclin A expression was a critical determinant for cell cycle checkpoint in RB positive cells, we attempted to restore cyclin A by ectopic expression. Rb+/+ MEFs were infected with recombinant adenovirus expressing either GFP (control) or expressing both human cyclin A and GFP. The expression of the ectopic human cyclin A could be readily detected in infected MEFs using antibodies directed against human cyclin A (Fig. 2 E). Treatment with CDDP inhibits the expression of endogenous cyclin A in control infected cells (Fig. 2 E), but does not influence the level of ectopically produced cyclin A. Therefore, we could evaluate whether the restoration of cyclin A expression can rescue the RB-mediated inhibition of DNA replication following CDDP damage. Wild-type (Rb+/+) MEFs infected with either GFP or GFP-cyclin A recombinant adenoviruses were treated with 0, 16, or 32 μm CDDP 24 h post-infections. These cells were then labeled with BrdUrd for 4 h and scored for the ability to incorporate BrdUrd. Untreated Rb+/+ MEFs incorporated BrdUrd at approximately the same levels after infection with cyclin A or GFP control adenoviral constructs. However, cells infected with a GFP-control construct showed inhibition of BrdUrd incorporation in a CDDP dose-dependent manner that was similar to the extent of inhibition observed with uninfected cells (Fig. 2 F). The infection of Rb+/+ cells with cyclin A restored BrdUrd incorporation at 16 μm CDDP (Fig. 2 F). However, in the presence of 32 μm CDDP, human cyclin A expression only partially restored BrdUrd incorporation (Fig. 2 F). Based on the importance of RB on the CDDP damage response we sought to determine the mechanism through which RB is activated to instill cell cycle inhibition. RB phosphorylation is controlled at numerous levels, including the kinase activity associated with CDK4/cyclin D and CDK2-cyclin E complexes. In general, DNA damage provokes a cellular response leading to increased expression of p53 and p21Cip1 and resulting in dephosphorylation/activation of RB. In MEFs, we failed to observe a significant induction of p21Cip1 following CDDP damage (Fig. 3 A), suggesting that an alternative pathway is mediating RB dephosphorylation. It is well established that the main function of D-type cyclins is functional inactivation of RB by phosphorylation, and it has recently been reported that cyclin D1 degradation participates in the DNA damage checkpoint response (32Agami R. Bernards R. Cell. 2000; 102: 55-66Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). We found that the protein levels of cyclin D1 were strongly inhibited in both Rb+/+ and Rb−/− MEFs treated with CDDP (Fig. 3 B). This result indicated that CDDP is capable of inducing molecular signals in both the Rb+/+ and Rb−/− cells, however, only in the presence of RB do these signals (i.e.cyclin D1 attenuation) elicit G1/S inhibition. The loss of cyclin D1 expression occurred within 4 h and could be blocked with proteosome inhibitors (not shown and see below). Under these same conditions CDK4 and p16ink4a protein were not influenced following treatment with CDDP in both wild type and RB−/− cells (Fig.3 B and not shown). Since CDK4 activity is required to initiate RB phosphorylation and cyclin D1 attenuation occurred in an RB-independent manner, this suggested that the attenuation of cyclin D1 may be a critical determinant for RB activation. The pathway coupling DNA damage to cyclin D1 degradation is unknown. To seek the possible candidates for CDDP signaling to cyclin D1, we employed mouse embryo fibroblasts defective in proteins involved in DNA-damage response (p21Cip1, c-Abl, and DNA-PK). Both DNA-PK and c-Abl kinases are implicated in the response to DNA damage (26Gong J.G. Costanzo A. Yang H.Q. Melino G. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Levrero M. Wang J.Y. Nature. 1999; 399: 806-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (834) Google Scholar, 33Nehme A. Baskaran R. Nebel S. Fink D. Howell S.B. Wang J.Y. Christen R.D. Br. J. Cancer. 1999; 79: 1104-1110Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). However, neither DNA-PK nor c-Abl is necessary for cyclin D1 degradation (Fig. 3 C). The CDK-inhibitor p21Cip1, is also not required for cyclin D1 degradation (Fig. 3 C). The DNA mismatch repair system plays an important role in the recognition of CDDP adducts, additionally cancer cells defective in mismatch repair are less sensitive to CDDP (25Buermeyer A.B. Wilson-Van Patten C. Baker S.M. Liskay R.M. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 538-541PubMed Google Scholar, 26Gong J.G. Costanzo A. Yang H.Q. Melino G. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Levrero M. Wang J.Y.

A. 1999; 96: 3911-3915Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Based on these observations, we hypothesized that mismatch repair complexes are involved in signaling cyclin D1 degradation and subsequent RB activation. The genes that encode proteins with roles in DNA mismatch repair include the MutS homologues MSH2, MSH3, MSH6, and MutL homologues MLH1, PMS1, and PMS2 (37Kolodner R.D. Marsischky G.T. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1999; 9: 89-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar). When mouse embryo fibroblast deficient in PMS2 were treated with 32 μm cisplatin for 16 h, cyclin D1 was not degraded (Fig. 3 D). Similarly, cyclin D1 was largely retained in MSH2-deficient cells treated with cisplatin (Fig. 3 D). Similar results were achieved with immortalized cells that are MLH1 deficient (MC2−/− cells, data not shown). Collectively our data demonstrate that mismatch repair components PMS2, MSH2, and MLH1 are requisite for cisplatin-mediated cyclin D1 degradation. To determine the influence of the mismatch repair on the DNA damage checkpoint response, we evaluated the ability of PMS2+/+ or PMS2−/− cells to incorporate BrdUrd in the presence of CDDP damage. The PMS2+/+ cells were readily inhibited for BrdUrd incorporation with 32 μm CDDP (Fig.4 A). In contrast, the PMS2−/− cells incorporated BrdUrd in the presence of CDDP damage (Fig. 4 A). Since the behavior of PMS2−/− cells paralleled the behavior of Rb−/− cells, we determined if these cells were compromised for signaling to cyclin A. In PMS2+/+ cells, cyclin D1 was attenuated and there is a concomitant decrease in cyclin A levels (Fig.4 B). For the PMS2−/− cells there was no cyclin D1 attenuation or reduction in cyclin A protein levels (Fig.4 B). Thus these data support the model that the mismatch repair-dependent attenuation of cyclin D1 is, in turn, requisite for the RB-dependent attenuation of cyclin A. Similar results were also observed with MSH2−/− MEFs (not shown). Loss of mismatch repair function occurs in tumors where it is believed to promote genomic instability and contribute to drug resistance (22Buermeyer A.B. Deschenes S.M. Baker S.M. Liskay R.M. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1999; 33: 533-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). We therefore determined if these initial findings in murine fibroblasts extended to human tumor systems, wherein we could better assess the functional consequence of cyclin D1 loss. In the hMLH1-deficient cell line HCT116, cyclin D1 levels were unchanged by exposure to cisplatin (Fig. 5 A). When hMLH1 is provided by transfer of chromosome 3 (HCT116 3-(6)) (24Koi M. Umar A. Chauhan D.P. Cherian S.P. Carethers J.M. Kunkel T.A. Boland C.R. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 4308-4312PubMed Google Scholar) cyclin D1 degradation occurred in response to cisplatin (Fig. 5 A, compare lanes 7 and 8). This restoration of signaling is specific, since transfer of chromosome 2 (HCT116 2-(1)) failed to facilitate degradation (Fig. 5 A). Similarly, in a colorectal cancer cell line proficient in mismatch repair, SW480, cyclin D1 levels were readily attenuated following cisplatin damage (Fig. 5 A). The dependence of cyclin D1 degradation on mismatch repair was independent of p53/p21Cip1 induction, since p53 and p21Cip1 were induced in all HCT cell lines by cisplatin (Fig. 5 A). Furthermore, the attenuation of cyclin D1 was independent of functional p53, as SW480 cells harboring mutant p53 failed to induce p21Cip1 but were proficient for cyclin D1 attenuation (Fig. 5 A). To confirm that the loss of cyclin D1 expression was in fact due to degradation, we employed the proteosome inhibitor Cbz-LLL, which prevented CDDP-mediated attenuation of cyclin D1 in SW480 cells (Fig. 5 B). To determine whether a similar dependence on mismatch repair (MLH-1 specifically) was evoked with different forms of DNA damage, HCT-116 or SW480 cells were treated with mitomycin C, doxorubicin, or etoposide. All of these treatments elicited degradation of cyclin D1 that was dependent on mismatch repair activity (Fig. 5 C). Together, these data couple mismatch repair to the cell cycle regulatory machinery through the degradation of cyclin D1. To assess the functional consequence of mismatch repair-dependent degradation of endogenous cyclin D1, we initially analyzed the G2-checkpoint by determining the ability of cisplatin treatment to inhibit entry into mitosis. For these studies HCT116, HCT116 3-(6), and SW 480 cells were treated with 0 or 32 μm CDDP for 16 h followed by incubation with nocadazole for an additional 6 h to enrich for mitotic cells. Approximately 50% of untreated cells were mitotic following enrichment with nocadazole. In contrast, following cisplatin treatment, mitotic index in these cells drops below 1% (Fig. 5 D). Therefore, CDDP damage blocks the transition into mitosis irrespective of mismatch repair status. To determine the role of mismatch repair on the ability of cells to undergo DNA synthesis, BrdUrd incorporation was analyzed. As quantified in Fig. 5 D, we found that in SW480 and HCT116 3-(6) cells, CDDP treatment led to a significant decrease in BrdUrd incorporation. In contrast, in parental HCT116 CDDP treatment failed to inhibit BrdUrd incorporation (Fig. 5 E). Since we had earlier linked mismatch repair-dependent cyclin D1 degradation to the RB/cyclin A-pathway, we investigated this pathway in the human tumor cell lines. Initially, HCT116 and SW480 cells were treated with 32 μmCDDP for 16 h and then analyzed the phosphorylation status of RB (Fig. 6A). Surprisingly, no significant dephosphorylation of RB was observed in either cell line (Fig.6 A). To demonstrate that RB can be dephosphorylated in these cells, we employed p16ink4a recombinant adenovirus, which effectively dephosphorylated RB (Fig. 6 A). To confirm that a minor pool of RB is not dephosphorylated in response to CDDP to mediate cell cycle arrest, we analyzed the expression of cyclin A, as a downstream target of active RB. In HCT116 and SW480 cells treated with 32 μm CDDP no attenuation of cyclin A"

Both lines of investigation utilize dye-labeled TATA-bearing oligomers and steady-state, stopped-flow, and time-resolved fluorescence techniques in conjunction with fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET). Global analysis of extensive real-time kinetic and thermodynamic data sets first revealed a linear three-step mechanism for the TBP·AdMLP reaction (16Parkhurst K.M. Richards R.M. Brenowitz M. Parkhurst L.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 289: 1327-1341Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), with intermediate conformers having DNA bent to the same extent as in the final complex. These conformers are present at high mole fraction throughout the reaction and persist at equilibrium. The parallel investigation of TBP·DNA solution structures concurrently revealed a strong sequence dependence of the DNA helical bend in such complexes (34Wu J. Parkhurst K.M. Powell R.M. Brenowitz M. Parkhurst L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14614-14622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Because the latter suggested TATA sequence-dependent recognition interactions, the mechanistic study was extended beyond AdMLP to include other sequences. We first asked the question, “How do the detailed recognition processes of different consensus sequences by TBP compare?” The E4 sequence was chosen as the alternate consensus sequence, because functional differences between the TBP·AdMLP and TBP·E4 interactions had been identified previously using DNase I footprinting (18Petri V. Hsieh M. Brenowitz M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 9977-9984Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 19Petri V. Hsieh M. Jamison E. Brenowitz M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15842-15849Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Extensive data collection and model fitting using global analysis showed the linear two-intermediate model to be common to the reaction of TBP with both strong promoters (20Powell R.M. Parkhurst K.M. Brenowitz M. Parkhurst L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29782-29791Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The energetics of the partial reactions for the two promoters was very similar for the initial step, formation of the first intermediate conformer. Beyond that initial binding and bending event, however, the reaction progression differed substantially, with the TBP·E4 interaction nearly complete after the second step but with the TBP·AdMLP reaction continuing to undergo large energetic changes in the final step. Having thus established a detailed comparison between the interactions of TBP with two consensus sequences, we have now examined TBP recognition of a variant sequence. The C7 sequence (TATAAACG) is a naturally occurring single base variant of the AdMLP sequence. TBP-bound C7 has a helical bend dramatically different from that in bound AdMLP that correlates with significantly reduced relative transcription efficiency (34Wu J. Parkhurst K.M. Powell R.M. Brenowitz M. Parkhurst L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14614-14622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). This solution geometry is highly sensitive to the presence and concentration of osmolytes (35Wu J. Parkhurst K.M. Powell R.M. Parkhurst L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14623-14627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), in contrast to that for the complexes bearing consensus sequences. Detailed kinetic and energetic profiles for the TBP·C7 interaction have been determined using FRET-based measurements. A comprehensive comparison with the TBP·AdMLP and TBP·E4 profiles clearly distinguishes the recognition process by TBP of the variant sequence from those of the consensus sequences. The ensemble of TBP·C7 data is well described by a three-step model with two branching pathways. One of these pathways is unique to the variant sequence mechanism and yields a bound species with DNA bent only slightly. Along the other pathway, the variant reaction proceeds through an intermediate conformer bearing strongly bent DNA in a process remarkably reminiscent of the consensus reactions. The temperature dependence of the TBP-bound C7 solution bend angle is proposed to arise from population shifts between conformers with slightly and severely bent DNA within a two-state model. Fourteen base fluorescently labeled DNA oligonucleotide probes and the unlabeled complementary strands were synthesized and purified by Sigma-Genosys (The Woodlands, TX) as described previously (16Parkhurst K.M.

TAMRA and fluorescein were linked covalently to the 5′- and 3′-ends, respectively, via six carbon linkers to form the double-labeled C7 top strand, TAMRA-5′GGGCTATAAACGGG3′-fluorescein (duplex denoted as T*C7dpx*F) with the single-labeled oligonucleotide having only the 3′-fluorescein (duplex denoted as C7dpx*F). All duplexes were formed using a 2× excess of complement. Full-length S. cerevisiae TBP was prepared as described previously (15Parkhurst K.M. Brenowitz M. Parkhurst L.J.

Studies were conducted in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 100 mm KCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2and 1 mm dithiothreitol at the temperatures indicated. Determination of equilibrium isotherms at 15, 20, 25, and 30 °C is described in the legend of Fig. 1. The interaction of TBP with T*C7dpx*F was monitored using fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) together with various fluorescence techniques. Detailed discussions of FRET and its applications to the present study have been published (15Parkhurst K.M. Brenowitz M. Parkhurst L.J.

Briefly, the rate constant for the non-radiative transfer of excited state energy from a donor to an acceptor fluorophore is highly dependent upon the distance separating the two dyes. Because the binding of TBP to a TATA-bearing promoter induces a bend in the DNA helical axis, binding to T*C7dpx*F results in a decrease in the 5′TAMRA-3′ fluorescein distance. The corresponding change in the efficiency of energy transfer is reflected in the fluorescence emission of the dyes and may be used to monitor these interactions with TBP in real time. For non-rigid molecules such as the fluorescently labeled oligomeric probes used in these studies, the 5′-end to 3′-end distance is described by a probability distribution, P(R), rather than by a single fixed value. Such distributions were extracted from time-resolved fluorescence emission measurements of free and TBP-bound T*C7dpx*F at 15, 20, 25, and 30 °C as described (34Wu J. Parkhurst K.M. Powell R.M.

Model-dependent bend angles for the bound duplex were then determined as described (34Wu J. Parkhurst K.M. Powell R.M. Brenowitz M. Parkhurst L.J. J. Biol.

The association binding of TBP with T*C7dpx*F has been investigated as described for TBP binding the adenovirus major late (AdMLP) and E4 promoters (16Parkhurst K.M. Richards R.M. Brenowitz M.

Briefly, solutions of 40 nm T*C7dpx*F were flowed against TBP solutions of 400, 800, or 1600 nm (prior to mixing), using a 1:1 mixing ratio, at 15, 20, 25, and 30 °C. Averaged replicate curves were fit using exponential decay models. The resulting set of eight curves, each deriving from a unique combination of temperature and TBP concentration, was used in global analyses. TBP·T*C7dpx*F complexes were challenged with a large excess of unlabeled C7 duplex (C7dpx), and dissociation was monitored using steady-state FRET as described (16Parkhurst K.M. Richards R.M. Brenowitz M. Parkhurst L.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 289: 1327-1341Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar,20Powell R.M. Parkhurst K.M. Brenowitz M. Parkhurst L.J. J. Biol.

The initial complex incorporating labeled DNA was formed and equilibrated using 19.2–20.3 nm T*C7dpx*F and 992.3–1004 nm TBP, the latter sufficient to ensure ≥94% duplex saturation at all temperatures. Dissociation kinetic data were obtained as a function of unlabeled DNA concentration, with C7dpx added to final concentrations of 17.9, 24.8, or 35.5 μm. Data obtained at 15, 20, and 25 °C were all well fit using a biexponential decay model as described (16Parkhurst K.M. Richards R.M. Brenowitz M. Parkhurst L.J. J. Mol.

A dependence of the TBP·T*C7dpx*F dissociation kinetics on C7dpx concentration was observed, indicating two contributions to the dissociation process: first-order replacement of labeled by unlabeled duplex and active removal, or second-order displacement, of labeled duplex. Similar complexity has been reported for TBP·T*E4dpx*F dissociation kinetics (20Powell R.M. Parkhurst K.M. Brenowitz M. Parkhurst L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29782-29791Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Extraction of the pure replacement curve at each temperature was necessary, because only that process is considered in subsequent global analysis. Two model-independent methods (20Powell R.M.

The recovered replacement kinetic curves at 15, 20, and 25 °C were subsequently used in the global analyses. The eight stopped-flow binding and three replacement kinetic curves and four equilibrium binding isotherms characterizing the TBP·C7 interaction were analyzed globally to explore their correspondence with various kinetic models. Analyses based on two- and three-step models, including both linear and branching schemes, are described below. To ensure meaningful comparisons with the previously determined results for TBP binding to consensus sequences, analyses were conducted in a manner analogous to those for TBP·AdMLP and TBP·E4 (16Parkhurst K.M.

Smoothed representations of the association and replacement curves and equilibrium binding isotherms were constructed as described (16Parkhurst K.M. Richards R.M. Brenowitz M. Parkhurst L.J. J. Mol.

The latter were scaled from 0 to 0.127 (15 °C), 0.216 (20 °C), 0.301 (25 °C), or 0.335 (30 °C), the temperature-dependent amplitude changes observed upon TBP·T*C7dpx*F binding in steady-state FRET measurements. The theoretical response functions were determined as described (16Parkhurst K.M. Richards R.M. Brenowitz M. Parkhurst L.J. J. Mol.

The overall average squared residual, ςglobal2, derived from the weighted variance between the observed and theoretical points describing the shapes of the association (ςSF2), replacement (ςR2), and equilibrium binding (ςK2) curves,ςglobal2=113[8ςSF2+2ςK2+3ςR2]Equation 1 with the coefficients reflecting the relative information content of each term. A fit with each term within its experimental error thus yields a value for ςglobal2 ≤ 1. Error estimates for the optimal parameter values were obtained exactly as described (16Parkhurst K.M.

The correspondence of the ensemble of TBP·C7 data was first tested against linear (Equation 2) and branching (Equation 3) two-step models, where the subscript “INT” denotes an intermediate conformer. Global analysis for either model yielded values for the four rate constants at 30 °C as well as the corresponding activation enthalpies. The quantum yields of the donor fluorescein in the two TBP-bound duplexes, relative to that of free T*C7dpx*F, were also determined. These quantum yield values indicate the relative extent of DNA bending in each binary complex, as they reflect the 5′dye-3′dye distance (15Parkhurst K.M. Brenowitz M. Parkhurst L.J.

First explored was a linear two-intermediate kinetic model, shown previously to describe both the TBP·AdMLP and TBP·E4 reactions (16Parkhurst K.M. Richards R.M. Brenowitz M. Parkhurst L.J. J. Mol.

Determined in the analysis were values for the six rate constants at 30 °C, the corresponding activation energies, and the quantum yield for each TBP-bound conformer relative to that of the free duplex. To reduce the number of fitting parameters, additional analyses were conducted with quantum yields constrained to be equivalent for either conformers A and B or conformers B and C, consistent with a two-state model for this interaction (34Wu J.

Two additional three-step models were explored, with two and three branching pathways, with the rate constants k 2 andk 3 in Equation 5 and k 2,k 3, and k 5 in Equation 6 being second-order. Relative quantum yield values were determined for each TBP-bound conformer, and additional analyses conducted with constraints on the quantum yields as for Equation 4. Finally, Equation 5 was extended to allow direct conversion between TBP·DNAA and TBP·DNAB, INT via rate constants k 7 and k 8.

JunB induced erythroid differentiation as evidenced by increased expression of the erythroid-specific proteins β-globin, spectrin-α, and TER-119. Expression of JunB for at least 48 h was required for the differentiated phenotype to emerge. Differentiation was accompanied by a slower rate of proliferation and an increase in the expression of the cell cycle inhibitory protein p27. p27 protein expression increased due to reduced turnover without changes in transcription, indicating global changes in cell physiology following JunB induction. JunB expression was also studied in mouse and human primary erythroid cells. JunB expression increased immediately in both primary mouse cells and HCD57 cells treated with EPO and quickly returned to base-line levels, followed by a secondary rise in JunB in primary erythroid cells, but not in HCD57 cells, 36–48 h later. This result suggested that the initial EPO-dependent JunB induction was not sufficient to induce differentiation, but that the late EPO-independent JunB expression in primary erythroid cells was necessary for differentiation.

Conflicting theories propose that EPO may be instructive in directing uncommitted cells into erythroid maturation or alternatively that EPO is permissive only in allowing the maturation of cells that spontaneously commit to erythroid development. Whereas it is possible that EPO acts to promote the proliferation, survival, and differentiation of cells committed to erythroid development, some workers have hypothesized that EPO acts primarily as a survival factor for proerythroblasts by preventing the cells from undergoing programmed cell death or apoptosis (1Koury M.J. Bondurant M.C. Am. J. Kidney Dis. 1991; 18: 20-23Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). This view is supported by the development of relatively mature erythroid cells at the colony-forming unit-erythroid (cfu-E) stage of differentiation in fetal EPO−/− null or EPO receptor−/− null mice; however, proerythroblasts undergo apoptosis in fetal mice with deletion of either EPO or the EPO receptor (2Wu H. Liu X. Jaenisch R. Lodish H.F. Cell. 1995; 83: 59-67Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (851) Google Scholar). The results show that EPO is absolutely necessary only during a small window in this process of erythroid maturation: cells at the cfu-E to proerythroblast stage of differentiation. If EPO is absent or suboptimal, these cells undergo apoptosis. If EPO is sufficient, these cells survive to mature to erythroblasts. Erythroblasts will continue to terminally differentiate even if EPO is absent. In murine proerythroblasts, this differentiation is accompanied by an increase in the expression of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-xL (3Gregoli P.A. Bondurant M.C. Blood. 1997; 90: 630-640Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is not yet clear if intracellular signals from the EPO receptor activated by EPO are limited to promoting survival or whether these EPO-dependent signals are necessary for continued proliferation and later differentiation characterized by induction of genes coding for erythrocyte membrane-specific protein and hemoglobin. Whereas the regulation of the expression of these erythroid-specific proteins by transcription factors such as GATA-1 and erythroid Kruppel-like factor has been described, regulators upstream of these events are not well characterized. A few in vitro EPO-induced erythroid differentiation models exist (4Tamir A. Petrocelli T. Stetler K. Chu W. Howard J. Croix B.S. Slingerland J. Ben David Y. Cell Growth Differ. 2000; 11: 269-277PubMed Google Scholar, 5Nagata Y. Takahashi N. Davis R.J. Todokoro K. Blood. 1998; 92: 1859-1869Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and erythroleukemic cells respond to chemicals such as Me2SO and hexamethylenebisacetamide by undergoing partial erythroid differentiation (6Francastel C. Mazouzi Z. Robert-Lezenes J. Leukemia (Baltimore). 1992; 6: 935-939PubMed Google Scholar, 7Suhasini M. Reddy C.D. Reddy E.P. DiDonato J.A. Pilz R.B. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 1859-1870Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Expression of the EPO receptor in Ba/F3 cells results in EPO-dependent transcription of the β-globin gene (8Liboi E. Carroll M. D'Andrea A.D. Mathey-Prevot B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11351-11355Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). These observations suggest a possible requirement for EPO-dependent signals that modulate transcription of erythroid genes at some point in erythroid maturation. erythropoietin colony-forming unit-erythroid activator protein-1 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate-responsive element tetracycline erythropoietin colony-forming unit-erythroid activator protein-1 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate-responsive element tetracycline JunB is a member of the activator protein-1 (AP-1) family of transcription factors that binds to a specific DNA sequence, the 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate-responsive element (TRE), to activate transcription of target genes. The AP-1 family consists of the Fos (c-Fos, Fra-1, Fra-2, and FosB) and Jun (c-Jun, JunB, and JunD) proteins, which are known as “early-response” proteins due to their up-regulation in response to extracellular stimuli affecting cell growth, differentiation, or survival. Inactivation of JunB in mice leads to embryonic lethality between embryonic days 6 and 8 due to vascular defects (9Schorpp-Kistner M. Wang Z.Q. Angel P. Wagner E.F. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 934-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). JunB appears to function as a negative regulator of a number of cell systems, including proliferation in response to negative growth factors (10Paterson I.C. Patel V. Sandy J.R. Prime S.S.

Biol. 1998; 18: 3699-3707Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). There is also evidence that JunB may play a central role in differentiation and growth arrest during hematopoiesis. In M1 mouse myeloid leukemic cells, induction of differentiation with either chemicals or cytokines is associated with an increase injunB expression (17Kasukabe T. Okabe-Kado J. Hozumi M. Honma Y. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 592-597PubMed Google Scholar, 18Sjin R.M. Lord K.A. Abdollahi A. Hoffman B. Liebermann D.A. J. Biol.

Blood. 1994; 84: 3095-3104Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). There is also some evidence that JunB may play a role in the differentiation of erythroid cells. JunB expression and DNA binding have been detected in Friend murine erythroleukemia-C cells induced to differentiate with Me2SO or hexamethylenebisacetamide, but not in control cells (6Francastel C. Mazouzi Z. Robert-Lezenes J. Leukemia (Baltimore). 1992; 6: 935-939PubMed Google Scholar, 7Suhasini M. Reddy C.D. Reddy E.P. DiDonato J.A. Pilz R.B. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 1859-1870Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Our laboratory uses the EPO-dependent murine erythroid cell line HCD57 as a model cell system for the study of erythroid proliferation, survival, and apoptosis. These cells depend on EPO for survival and proliferation, but do not differentiate in the presence of EPO. We have demonstrated that AP-1 DNA-binding activity induced in the growth factor withdrawal state is associated with an increase injunB message, JunB protein, and DNA-binding activity. Stable expression of a dominant-negative AP-1 mutant prevents apoptosis of HCD57 cells in the absence of EPO and prevents the down-regulation of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-xL (16Jacobs-Helber S.M. Wickrema A. Birrer M.J. Sawyer S.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3699-3707Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Therefore, in the absence of EPO, junB expression correlates with the induction of apoptosis. To further investigate the role ofjunB in erythropoiesis, we were interested in the effect JunB expression might have in the presence of EPO. In this study, we show that, in the presence of EPO, overexpression of junBinduces differentiation of HCD57 cells. Furthermore, we found that JunB expression is associated with terminal differentiation of both mouse and human primary erythroid progenitors, thereby suggesting an additional role for JunB in the regulation of erythropoiesis. HCD57(K) cells (described previously (20Jacobs-Helber S.M. Ryan J.J. Sawyer S.T. Blood. 2000; 96: 933-940Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)) stably expressing the pTET-OFF transactivator plasmid were a gift from Dr. Steve Brandt (Vanderbilt University) and were cultured in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium (Invitrogen) containing 30% fetal calf serum, 50 μg/ml Geneticin (Invitrogen), and 10 μg/ml gentamycin at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 environment and maintained in 2 units of EPO/ml of medium. To create the tetracycline (Tc)-inducible pTRE-JunB plasmid, the human junB gene was excised from the parental pGEM4-JunB cDNA on a HindIII/PstI fragment. The ends of the fragment were filled in with Klenow DNA polymerase. EcoRI/NotI adaptors (Invitrogen) were ligated onto the blunted fragment, and this fragment was ligated into the unique EcoRI site of the pTRE plasmid. The resulting pTRE-JunB plasmid was cotransfected with the pTK-Hyg plasmid (CLONTECH) at a 20:1 ratio into the HCD57(K) cells using DIMRIE-C reagent (Invitrogen), and stable clones were selected by limiting dilution in the medium described above supplemented with 400 μg/ml hygromycin and 2 μg/ml tetracycline (to repress junB expression). Hygromycin-resistant cell lines were then cultured for 24 h in the absence of Tc and screened for JunB expression by Northern blot analysis using the junBcDNA as a probe. The clone used in these studies was the strongest expresser of junB and was designated HCD57-JunB. For each time point, 5 × 106 HCD57-JunB cells were used. For induction of junB expression, the cells were washed three times with serum-free medium and incubated in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium containing 30% fetal calf serum, 50 μg/ml Geneticin, and 2 units/ml EPO, but in the absence of Tc, for the times indicated in the figure legends. For the electrophoretic mobility shift assay, HCD57-JunB cells were washed to remove Tc as indicated above and then incubated in medium either supplemented with 2 μg/ml Tc (to repress JunB expression) in concentrations of Tc indicated in the figure legends or without Tc to induce JunB expression. For the protein turnover studies, the HCD57-JunB cells were cultured for 48 h in the absence or presence of Tc, followed by treatment with 100 μm cycloheximide for the times indicated. To test the effect of length of JunB expression on differentiation, cells were washed to remove Tc from the medium, and then Tc was re-added to the medium at the times indicated. junB mRNA expression ceased within 4 h of Tc re-addition (data not shown). Nuclear extracts and total cell extracts were prepared as previously described (21Penta K. Sawyer S.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31282-31287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), and 20 μg of protein were subjected to Western blot analysis with anti-JunB (N-17), anti-actin (I-19), anti-p16 (M-156), anti-spectrin-α (C-20), or anti-spectrin-β (C-18) antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or mouse monoclonal anti-p27 antibody (Transduction Laboratories). Western-blotted proteins were visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). The level of p27 protein expression during cycloheximide treatment was quantitated using a scanning densitometer and analyzed using ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics, Inc.). For the cell viability studies, cells were washed with medium as indicated above and cultured at 1 × 105 cells/ml in the presence of EPO and in the absence or presence of 2 μg/ml Tc. Cell viability was determined by counting cells in a hemocytometer in the presence of 0.2% trypan blue. Primary murine erythroid progenitors infected with the anemia-inducing strain of the Friend virus (FVA cells) were isolated as previously described (3Gregoli P.A. Bondurant M.C. Blood. 1997; 90: 630-640Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and 106 FVA cells were cultured in EPO for 0, 2, 4, 8, 24, 36, and 48 h. Primary human erythroid progenitors were derived by in vitro culture of CD34+ cells isolated from peripheral blood. Growth factor-mobilized peripheral blood collected from normal donors was purchased from AllCells, LLC (Berkeley, CA). CD34+ cells were isolated from growth factor-mobilized peripheral blood cells using the antibody-coated paramagnetic microbeads in the CliniMACSTM cell isolation device (Miltenyi Biotec, Inc., Auburn, CA). The isolated cells were >95% positive for CD34 as determined by flow cytometry and were cultured for 7–8 days to obtain highly purified erythroid progenitors that were at the cfu-E stage of differentiation. The cell culture medium contained 15% fetal calf serum, 15% human AB serum, Iscove’s modified Dulbecco’s medium, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 10 ng/ml interleukin-3, 2 units/ml EPO, 50 ng/ml stem cell factor, and 50 ng/ml insulin-like growth factor-1. To facilitate terminal differentiation, stem cell factor was omitted from the culture medium beyond day 5 of culture. >90% of these cells were positive for CD71 and glycophorin A as determined by flow cytometry and produced erythroid colonies when plated in methylcellulose. Day 7, 9, and 14 cfu-E cells are at the basophilic, polychromatophilic, and orthochromatic stages of differentiation, respectively. Following treatment of the cells, total RNA was isolated using the RNeasy miniprep kit (QIAGEN Inc.), and 10 μg of total RNA were subjected to Northern blot analysis as previously described (16Jacobs-Helber S.M. Wickrema A. Birrer M.J. Sawyer S.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3699-3707Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). cDNA probes to junB or β-globin (kindly provided by Dr. Joyce Lloyd, Virginia Commonwealth University) were labeled with [α-32P]dCTP using the random priming method (Stratagene). Filters were hybridized to the probes as previously described (16Jacobs-Helber S.M. Wickrema A. Birrer M.J. Sawyer S.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3699-3707Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The blots were washed under high stringency conditions and visualized with autoradiography for 3 days at −80 °C. Changes in mRNA expression were quantified using the Cyclone phosphoimager and Optiquant Image analysis software (Becton Dickinson). For RNase protection of AP-1 andbcl family members, the murine AP-1 and APO-2 RNase protection templates, respectively (both from BD Pharmingen), were transcribed in vitro using the Riboquant in vitro transcription kit (BD Pharmingen). 5 μg of total RNA isolated from HCD57-JunB cells were subjected to RNase protection using the Riboquant RNase protection kit (BD Pharmingen) and resolved on a 5% polyacrylamide gel containing 7 m urea and 0.5× Tris borate/EDTA. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays and supershift assays were conducted as previously described (16Jacobs-Helber S.M. Wickrema A. Birrer M.J. Sawyer S.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3699-3707Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) using an electrophoretic mobility shift assay (Stratagene). 10 μg of nuclear extract were incubated with a [γ-32P]ATP-labeled double-stranded DNA fragment corresponding to the TRE (sense strand, 5′-CTAGTGATGAGTCAGCCGGATC-3′) at 4 °C in the absence or presence of 10× unlabeled TRE and subjected to electrophoresis at 25 mA for 2.5 h at 4 °C on 7% polyacrylamide gels. The gels were driedin vacuo for 1.5 h and exposed to x-ray film overnight at room temperature. For the supershift assay, 5 μg of nuclear extract were preincubated with 4 μg of anti-JunB antibody (Geneka Biotechnologies, Inc.) for 1 h at 4 °C prior to incubation with the [γ-32P]ATP-labeled TRE for 15 min at 4 °C and electrophoresis at 4 °C as described above. Dried gels were exposed to x-ray film for 2–3 days at −80 °C. Differentiation of HCD57-JunB cells was measured by detection of the mature erythroid-specific marker TER-119 using flow cytometry. 2 × 105 HCD57-JunB cells cultured with junB induced or uninduced for 96 h were washed once with fluorescence-activated cell sorter buffer (1× phosphate-buffered saline, 2% fetal calf serum, and 0.1% sodium azide) and preincubated with 20 μg/ml anti-Fcγ receptor II blocking antibody 2.4G2 (BD Pharmingen) for 15 min at 4 °C. The cells were then incubated with either phycoerythrin-labeled rat IgG (BD Pharmingen) or phycoerythrin-labeled rat anti-mouse TER-119 antibody (BD Pharmingen) at a final concentration of 2 μg/ml for 30 min at 4 °C. The cells were washed twice with fluorescence-activated cell sorter buffer and then subjected to flow cytometry using the FACScan flow cytometer. For DNA fragmentation studies, cells were cultured at 1 × 105 cells/ml in the absence or presence of 1 unit/ml EPO or in the presence of EPO and in the absence or presence of Tc. 2 × 106 cells were harvested at 24-h intervals, and genomic DNA was isolated from the cells using the Omniprep genomic DNA isolation kit (Genotech, Inc). 10 μg of genomic DNA were resolved on a 2.25% agarose gel containing 1× Tris acetate/EDTA and 300 ng/ml ethidium bromide. DNA laddering indicative of apoptosis was visualized using ultraviolet light. HCD57-JunB cells were cultured in the presence of 2 units/ml EPO and in the absence (junBexpression-induced) or presence (junBexpression-suppressed) of Tc for 48 h. 500 μg of cell extracts isolated from 5 × 106 cells were subjected to immunoprecipitation as previously described (22Jacobs-Helber S.M. Penta K. Sun Z.H. Lawson A. Sawyer S.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6850-6853Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) with anti-Cdk2 (M-2) or anti-cyclin E (M-20) antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and protein A-agarose (Transduction Laboratories). Anti-Cdk2 and anti-cyclin E antibody-immunoprecipitated proteins were concentrated in 25 μl of lysis buffer and subjected to an in vitro kinase assay as previously described (22Jacobs-Helber S.M. Penta K. Sun Z.H. Lawson A. Sawyer S.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6850-6853Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) using 5 μg of histone H1 (Sigma) as a substrate. Following electrophoresis of the samples on a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, the proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose and exposed to autoradiography for 18 h at −80 °C with an intensifying screen to visualize phosphorylated histone H1. The blots were then probed with monoclonal anti-p27 antibody and finally with anti-Cdk2 or anti-cyclin E antibody to ensure equal loading of proteins. To investigate the role of JunB in erythropoiesis, thejunB gene was cloned downstream of a Tc-inducible promoter and stably transfected into HCD57(K) cells, which undergo massive apoptosis within 24 h of EPO withdrawal (20Jacobs-Helber S.M. Ryan J.J. Sawyer S.T. Blood. 2000; 96: 933-940Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have designated the cell line used in this study HCD57-JunB. Removal of Tc from the cells resulted in rapid up-regulation of the junB message.junB expression was detected within 3 h of Tc removal and reached its maximum 12 h after removal of Tc (Fig.1 A). Overexposure of this Northern blot detected low endogenous junB expression in this cell line (data not shown) comparable to that seen in our previous studies (16Jacobs-Helber S.M. Wickrema A. Birrer M.J. Sawyer S.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3699-3707Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Western blot analysis revealed an increase in JunB protein that correlated with the increase in junBmRNA expression; we consistently observed an ∼10-fold increase in JunB protein 24 h after Tc withdrawal (Fig. 1 B,lane E). An electrophoretic mobility shift assay of HCD57-JunB cells washed and then cultured in fresh medium containing Tc to prevent junB expression revealed a weak shift 1 h after the cells were recultured, and this shift rapidly decreased and was undetectable 24 h after the start of the experiment (Fig. 1 C, lane 2). When Tc was removed to induce junB expression, however, a strong increase in AP-1 DNA-binding activity was detected 3 h after Tc removal, and this increase continued over the 24-h time course (Fig. 1 C,lanes 9–11). Supershift analysis showed that JunB was present in all bands of the AP-1 complex as evidenced by the shifted bands (Fig. 1 C, lane 16, dashed arrows) and the loss of the uppermost band seen in the absence of antibody (asterisk). Further supershift analysis revealed the presence of c-Jun, JunD, c-Fos, FosB, and the AP-1-related proteins activating transcription factor-1 and -2 in the AP-1 complex; other Fos and Jun proteins were not detected (data not shown). These results indicate that the HCD57-JunB cell line is tightly controlled and produces functional JunB protein when induced by the removal of Tc from the medium. When HCD57-JunB cells were harvested after culturing the cells for 96 h in EPO, but in the absence of Tc, we noticed that the pelleted cells had turned bright red (data not shown). This remarkable observation strongly suggested that the HCD57-JunB cells were synthesizing hemoglobin as a result of junB expression, indicating partial differentiation of these erythroleukemic cells. To determine what percentage of cells was taking on a more differentiated phenotype, the expression of the late erythroid-specific surface protein TER-119, a protein that associates with glycophorin A (23Kina T. Ikuta K. Takayama E. Wada K. Majumdar A.S. Weissman I.L. Katsura Y. Br. J. Haematol. 2000; 109: 280-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar), was investigated. Flow cytometry revealed that the entire population of HCD57 cells expressing junB exhibited an increase in the surface expression of TER-119 (Fig.2 A, arrow). The differentiated phenotype of HCD57-JunB cells was further explored by assessing the expression of three markers of erythroid differentiation: β-globin, a key component of the hemoglobin molecule, and spectrin-α and spectrin-β, two proteins necessary for the assembly of the erythrocyte membrane. Northern blot analysis revealed that β-globin expression was strongly induced by 48 h following JunB induction, with expression still increasing at 96 h when the experiment was stopped (Fig. 2 B). Varying the expression of JunB by varying the concentration of Tc in the culture medium revealed that the increased expression of β-globin correlated with the level of JunB expression (Fig. 2 C). Western blot analysis revealed that spectrin-β expression was high in the absence and unaltered by the induction of junB expression (Fig.2 D, lower panel); by contrast, the expression of spectrin-α was induced by junB expression with the same kinetics as the emergence of β-globin expression (upper panel). Therefore, HCD57 leukemic cells express some erythroid-specific markers (spectrin-β), but express other differentiation markers only when junB is induced (spectrin-α, β-globin, and TER-119). junB, like all AP-1 genes, is thought of as an “immediate-early” gene, having its effect soon after its activation by growth factors or stress. We were therefore interested in whether the induction of differentiation was caused by immediate-early induction of junB expression or whether a longer period ofjunB expression was necessary for the differentiated phenotype. When junB expression was induced for 7 h and then suppressed by re-addition of Tc to the medium, the HCD57-JunB cells did not differentiate, as shown by a lack of increase in β-globin expression (Fig. 2 E). junB had to be expressed for at least 48 h for maximum β-globin expression to occur (Fig. 2 D, lane E). Therefore, it appears that long-term junB expression is necessary for differentiation of HCD57 cells. The effect of long-term expression of junB on the erythroleukemic cells led us to investigate whether similar expression patterns might be seen in differentiating primary erythroid cells. junB expression was assessed in primary murine erythroid progenitors infected with the anemia-inducing strain of the Friend spleen focus-forming virus (FVA cells), which begin terminal differentiation within 48 h after treatment with EPO. Northern blot analysis showed that FVA cells induced to differentiate in the presence of EPO exhibited both an initial increase in mRNA expression of junB and a later increase 36–48 h after addition of EPO (Fig. 3 A). By contrast, HCD57 cells deprived of EPO and then stimulated with EPO showed a similar initial increase in junB expression 1 h after EPO induction (Fig. 3 A, lane I); this increased junB expression rapidly decreased and did not increase again. This experiment was repeated using RNase protection analysis, and the expression of junB and the housekeeping gene gapdh was quantified. Immediately following treatment with EPO, junB expression increased ∼3-fold in both FVA and HCD57 cells. During terminal differentiation of FVA cells (24–48 h after EPO addition), junB expression increased ∼5-fold relative to total RNA, whereas gapdh expression decreased to 30% of the starting levels. HCD57 erythroleukemic cells showed no such increase in junB expression during this time period. We then investigated junB expression in normal human colony-forming cells cultured in EPO. For this experiment, CD34+ early hematopoietic cells were cultured under conditions that promote the development of cfu-E cells. The cfu-E (day 7) cells were then further cultured to allow terminal differentiation to occur. junBexpression was low during the early cfu-E stage of differentiation (the proerythroblast stage), but increased by day 9 (the polychromatophilic stage) and was still elevated in day 14 terminally differentiated cells (the orthochromatic stage) (Fig. 3 B). Therefore, in both murine and human primary erythroid progenitors, elevatedjunB expression is observed during differentiation of the cells. Other hallmarks of differentiation include suppression of proliferation and potential changes in cell cycle regulatory proteins. We therefore investigated the expression of c-jun in the HCD57-JunB cells because we have previously shown a role for c-jun in the proliferation of HCD57 cells (16Jacobs-Helber S.M. Wickrema A. Birrer M.J. Sawyer S.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3699-3707Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). RNase protection analysis of the expression of all jun andfos family members during the induction ofjunB revealed a transient increase in the expression of c-jun, junD, and junB 1 h after fresh medium was added, with no significant changes in expression thereafter and an increase in c-fos expression during the first 48 h after removal of Tc (Fig.4). The stably transfectedjunB gene is the human junB gene, so only the native murine junB expression induced was observed in this experiment. No changes in other AP-1 family"

To identify important residues, we prepared several chimeric FIXa proteins using homologous sequences from FVII: FIXaFVIIEGF2 (FIXΔ88–124,∇FVII91–127), FIXaloop1 (FIXΔ88–99,∇FVII91–102), FIXaloop2 (FIXΔ95–109,∇FVII98–112), FIXaloop3 (FIXΔ111–124,∇FVII114–127), and point mutants (FIXaR94D and FIXaloop1G94R). In the presence and absence of FVIIIa, a 2- to 10-fold reducedV max of FX activation (nm FXa min−1) was observed for FIXaFVIIEGF2, FIXaloop1, FIXaloop2, and FIXaloop1G94R, whereas FIXaloop3 and FIXaR94D were normal. For all of the FIXa proteins, K m (app) values were normal as were EC50 values for interactions with FVIIIa. However,K d (app) (in nm) for the FX activating complex assembled on phospholipid vesicles was increased for FIXaFVIIEGF2 (43.3 ± 2.70), FIXaloop1(10.9 ± 2.8), FIXaloop2(70.5 ± 1.60), and FIXaloop1G94R (17.1 ± 2.90) relative to FIXaN (3.9 ± 0.11), FIXaWT(4.6 ± 0.17), FIXaloop3 (4.5 ± 0.20), and FIXaR94D (2.2 ± 0.09) suggesting that reducedV max is a result of impaired complex assembly.

Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 1806-1808Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). While EGF2 has not been extensively characterized, experiments have indicated its importance for activation of FX. A chimeric FIXa protein in which both EGF1 and EGF2 domains were replaced by those of FX possessed about 4% clotting activity (24Lin S.W. Smith K.J. Welsch D. Stafford D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 144-150Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, a chimeric protein with the FX EGF1 domain but the wild type FIX EGF2 domain was entirely normal (24Lin S.W. Smith K.J. Welsch D. Stafford D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 144-150Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting an essential function for EGF2. More recent experiments from our laboratory have indicated that EGF2 is likely involved in mediating surface binding to both platelets and phospholipids (25Ahmad S.S. Rawala R. Cheung W.F. Stafford D.W. Walsh P.N. Biochem. J. 1995; 310: 427-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 26Wong M.Y. Gurr J.A. Walsh P.N. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8948-8960Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). To further define the contribution of the EGF2 domain to surface binding, we have prepared several chimeric FIXa proteins (see Fig. 1) using homologous sequences from FVII. These FIXa proteins include FIXaFVIIEGF2(FIXΔ88–124,∇FVII91–127), 2The notation Δ denotes a deletion of FIX residues; ∇ represents an insertion of FVII residues. FIXaloop1 (FIXΔ88–99,∇FVII91–102), FIXaloop2 (FIXΔ95–109,∇FVII98–112), and FIXaloop3 (FIXΔ111–124,∇FVII114–127). The point mutants (FIXaR94D and FIXaloop1G94R) have been prepared to address the functional importance of Arg94. These chimeras and mutant FIXa proteins were tested for their ability to activate FX as part of the FX activating complex assembled on phospholipid vesicles. From these studies we have determined that residues 88–109 (but not Arg94) in the EGF2 domain are important for phospholipid surface assembly of the FX activating complex.

Preparation of the cDNAs for FIXR94D and FIXloop1G94R was performed as described by Picard et al. (29Picard V. Ersdal-Badju E., Lu, A. Bock S.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 2587-2591Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar) using the following mutagenic primers (FIXR94D: 5′-ATTAAGAATGGCGATTGCGAGCAGTTT and FIXloop1 G94R: 5′-AACGAGAACGGCAGATGTGAGCAGTAC) and the flanking primers from above. All PCR reactions contained 20 mm Tris (pH 8.8), 10 mm KCl, 10 mm(NH4)2SO4, 2 mmMgSO4, 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100, BSA (100 μg/ml), 200 μm each deoxynucleoside triphosphate (dATP, dCTP, dGTP, dTTP; Amersham Biosciences), and 2.5 units ofPyrococcus furiosis DNA polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) in a final reaction volume of 100 μl and overlaid with 100 μl of mineral oil (Sigma). cDNA fragments for each of the chimeric and mutant FIX proteins were subcloned into the expression vector pCMV5 and sequenced at the DNA Sequencing Facility at the University of Pennsylvania. Stable cell lines expressing the various FIX chimeras and mutants were prepared by transfection of HEK293 cells using the calcium phosphate precipitation technique with commercially available reagents (Promega, Madison, WI) and the manufacturer's protocol. Transfection experiments included the appropriate FIX expression vector, pCMV.hgc, and a neomycin resistance vector (pSV2Neo). G418-resistant cell lines were subcultured with the aid of sterile polyester swabs (Hardwood Products Company, Guilford, ME). Expression of FIX in the medium was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay as previously described (26Wong M.Y. Gurr J.A. Walsh P.N. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8948-8960Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Cell lines exhibiting maximal expression of FIX proteins were expanded for preparative-scale protein expression. FIX proteins were purified from serum-free conditioned medium using Q-Sepharose chromatography as described previously (26Wong M.Y. Gurr J.A. Walsh P.N. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8948-8960Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 30Yan S.C. Razzano P. Chao Y.B. Walls J.D. Berg D.T. McClure D.B. Grinnell B.W. Bio/Technology. 1990; 8: 655-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Q-Sepharose was used as a “pseudoaffinity” strategy for the purification of recombinant FIX proteins from serum-free conditioned medium. Serum-free conditioned medium was adjusted to contain 5 mm benzamidine and 5 mm EDTA, centrifuged (6000 × g), and filtered through cellulose acetate membranes (0.22-μm pore size) to remove cell debris. Q-Sepharose was pre-equilibrated with TBS supplemented with 2 mmbenzamidine and 2 mm EDTA. The medium was chromatographed, and the resin was washed with the equilibration buffer. EDTA was removed from the resin by washing with TBS supplemented with 2 mm benzamidine. FIX proteins were eluted from the column with TBS supplemented with 2 mm benzamidine and 5 mm CaCl2. The FIX proteins recovered from the Q-Sepharose column were dialyzed against HT and concentrated using Centri-prep 3 concentrators. FIX proteins were stored in small aliquots under liquid nitrogen. γ-Carboxyglutamate analysis was performed as described by Przysiecki (31Przysiecki C.T. Staggers J.E. Ramjit H.G. Musson D.G. Stern A.M. Bennett C.D. Friedman P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 7856-7860Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). It was generously performed by Dr. Rodney Camire in the laboratory of Dr. Katherine High (Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA). Extruded phospholipid vesicles composed of (mol/mol) 25% phosphatidylserine and 75% phosphatidylcholine were prepared according to the following protocol: dioleoyl-phosphatidylcholine and porcine brain phosphatidylserine were mixed in a 3:1 molar ratio and dried under nitrogen. The lipids were redissolved in benzene, frozen on dry ice, and lyophilized until dry. The lipids were resuspended in HT and incubated on ice for 30 min with intermittent mixing. The lipids were subjected to a freeze-thaw cycle (dry ice, 37 °C) five times and extruded by passage through three stacked polycarbonate membrane filters (100-nm pore size) a total of six times. The final lipid concentration was ∼2 mm. FIX proteins were activated to their FIXa forms as follows: FIX proteins were diluted in HT supplemented with 10 mm CaCl2. FXIa was added to a 1/200 molar ratio, and the reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 90 min. Complete activation was judged by SDS-PAGE/silver staining and by active site titration with ATIII. FIXa proteins were stored in small aliquots at −80 °C Activated FIX proteins were separated on a 8–16% polyacrylamide gradient gel. The gel was placed in transfer buffer (48 mm Tris, 30 mm glycine, 0.037% w/v SDS, 20% v/v methanol) for 20 min with gentle agitation. Immobilon-P PVDF membrane (Millipore) and filter paper were cut to fit the gel. Filter paper was wetted with transfer buffer. PVDF was wetted with methanol then transfer buffer. The transfer of proteins from the gel to the PVDF was performed in a Transblot SD semi-dry transfer cell (Bio-Rad) at constant current (0.8 mA per cm2) for 20 min. The PVDF was agitated in blocking buffer (10% Irish cream in TBS) overnight while shaking. The PVDF was incubated for 1 h with 1:1000 dilution (0.5 mg/ml stock) of affinity-purified goat anti-human-FIX polyclonal antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase in TBS-Tween (TBS supplemented with 0.1% v/v Tween 20) at 4 °C. After incubation with the horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody, the PVDF was washed two times for 5 min each in TBS-Tween. A commercially available substrate (Kirkegaard and Perry Laboratories, Gaithersburg, MD) was used for visualization according to the following protocol: 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine (0.4 g/L) solution was mixed with an equivolume of hydrogen peroxide (0.02% in citric acid buffer) and 0.1 volume of membrane-enhancing reagent. The PVDF was incubated at room temperature with the substrate solution until the desired intensity of the bands was achieved. The reaction was terminated by rinsing the membrane with distilled water, and the PVDF membrane was allowed to dry at room temperature. FIXa was active site-titrated by ATIII according to the following method (32Lozier J.N. Monroe D.M. Stanfield-Oakley S. Lin S.W. Smith K.J. Roberts H.R. High K.A. Blood. 1990; 75: 1097-1104Crossref PubMed Google Scholar): ATIII dilutions (0–100 nm) and FIXa proteins (∼100 nm) were prepared in HT supplemented with BSA (0.5 mg/ml), heparin (20 μg/ml), and 5 mm CaCl2. FIXa dilution was added to a tube containing the ATIII dilution, incubated at 37 °C for 20 min, then diluted 10-fold using HT supplemented with BSA (0.5 mg/ml). Residual FIXa activity was determined by assaying FXa generation activity in the following assay conditions: 5 mmCaCl2, 400 nm FX, FVIII (5 units/ml), and 20 μm PSPC vesicles. The reactions were initiated by addition of thrombin to 1 unit/ml. After 2 min, the reactions were terminated by the addition of stopping buffer (50 mm HEPPS, pH 8.1, 175 mm NaCl, and 20 mm EDTA). FXa generated was determined by hydrolysis of the chromogenic substrate S-2765. S-2765 dissolved to 600 μm in 50 mmHEPPS, pH 8.1, and 175 mm NaCl was mixed with the sample in micrometer wells, and change in absorbance at 405 nm was monitored immediately. FXa was assayed by hydrolysis of the FXa-specific chromogenic substrate S-2765. FXa (50 μl) was added to wells of a microtiter plate, and S-2765 (50 μl) was added to a final concentration of 350 μm. Change in absorbance at 405 nm was monitored immediately. Unknown FXa concentrations were determined by comparison to a standard curve prepared with known dilutions of FXa. FIXa proteins were added to 10 nmin reaction vessels containing 20 μm extruded PSPC vesicles in HT supplemented with BSA (0.5 mg/ml) and 5 mmCaCl2. FIXa proteins were incubated with the PSPC vesicles at 37 °C for 2 min. The reactions were initiated by addition of FX to the indicated final concentrations. After 20 min at 37 °C, the reactions were stopped by addition of EDTA to 10 mm. FXa was determined as described above. Velocity of FXa generation (nm FXa/min) was plotted as a function of input FX concentration (nm FX). Values ofK m (app) andV max were determined as described below. FIXa proteins were added to 15 nmin reaction vessels containing 1 μm extruded PSPC vesicles in HT supplemented with BSA (0.5 mg/ml) and 5 mmCaCl2. FIXa proteins were incubated with the PSPC vesicles at 37 °C for 2 min. FVIII was activated to FVIIIa (5 units/ml final) by 0.1 unit/ml thrombin for 1 min immediately before addition to the reaction vessels. After a 1-min incubation at 37 °C, the reactions were initiated by addition of FX to the indicated final concentrations. After 2 min at 37 °C, the reactions were stopped by addition of EDTA to 10 mm. FXa was determined as described above. Velocity of FXa generation (nm FXa/min) was plotted as a function of input FX concentration (nm FX). Values ofK m (app) and V maxwere determined as described below. FVIIIa was titrated into the FX activation reaction to determine the concentration that results in 50% maximal stimulation of rate of activation (EC50) and the maximum velocity observed when FVIIIa is at saturating concentrations (V max8). FIXa proteins were added to 5 nm in reaction vessels containing 500 nmextruded PSPC vesicles in HT supplemented with BSA (0.5 mg/ml) and 5 mm CaCl2. FVIII was added to the indicated concentration and activated by 0.1 units/ml thrombin for 1 min. The reactions were initiated by addition of FX to 250 nm. After 2 min at 37 °C, the reactions were stopped by addition of EDTA to 10 mm. FXa was determined as described above. Velocity of FXa generation (nm FXa/min) was plotted as a function of input FX concentration (nm FX). Values for EC50 andV max8 were determined as described below. Various concentrations of FIXa proteins were incubated with 1 μmPSPC vesicles in HT supplemented with BSA (0.5 mg/ml) and 5 mm CaCl2 for 2 min at 37 °C. FVIII was activated to FVIIIa (5 units/ml final) by thrombin (0.1 units/ml) for 1 min at 37 °C immediately before addition to the reaction mixes. The reactions, initiated by addition of FX to 250 nm, continued for 2 min at 37 °C and were stopped by addition of EDTA to 10 mm. FXa was determined as described above. Velocity of FXa generation (nm FXa/min) was plotted as a function of input FIXa concentration (nm FIXa).K d (app) was determined as described below. FIXa proteins were added to 50 nm in reaction vessels containing HT supplemented with BSA (0.5 mg/ml) and 5 mmCaCl2. FIXa proteins were incubated at 37 °C for 2 min. The reactions were initiated by addition of FX to the indicated final concentrations. After 1 h at 37 °C the reactions were stopped by addition of EDTA to 10 mm. FXa was determined as described above. Velocity of FXa generation (nm FXa/min) was plotted as a function of input FX concentration (nmFX). Data were analyzed as described below. Rates of FXa generation from all reactions were fitted to a rectangular hyperbola curve using a non-linear least squares fit. Constants for K m ,V max, EC50,V max8,K d (app), andV max9 were derived using the same Kalaidegraph Software. Between-group differences were tested for statistical significance using analysis of variance followed by pair-wise comparisons with the Bonferroni adjustment procedure for multiple comparisons maintaining an experiment-wise Type 1 error level of 0.05 (33Winer B.J. Brown D.R. Michels K.M. Statistical Principles in Experimental Design. 3rd Ed. McGraw-Hill, Inc., NY1991: 158-166Google Scholar). For the solution-phase activation of FX, data analysis was performed by least squares regression. A separate regression analysis was performed for each protein. Slopes and intercepts were tested for significance along with linearity of regression. Ninety-five percent confidence limits were generated for each slope and intercept. Differences between slopes were tested using an independentt test with a Bonferroni adjustment to correct for multiple comparisons (34Dixon W.J. Massey F.J. Introduction to Statistical Analysis. McGraw-Hill, Inc., NY1969: 207-210Google Scholar). Differences were considered significant if the probability of chance occurrence was less than or equal to 0.05. PredictedV max values (see Table II) are shown for comparison with experimentally determined V maxvalues. The predicted V max values were determined from the following equation: V max(estimated) = V max9 × [FIXa]/(K d (app) + [FIXa]) whereV max9 is the velocity in the presence of saturating FIXa concentration andK d (app) is the apparent dissociation constant for the binding of FIXa to the factor X activating complex and the input FIXa concentration used in the experiment (15 nm).Table IIKinetic properties of the various FIXa EGF2 chimeras and mutants on phospholipid vesiclesFIXaFVIIIa (5 units · ml−1)No FVIIIaK m (nm)V max (nmFXa · min−1)PredictedV max§K m (nm)V max (nmFXa · min−1)N53.5 ± 5.838.5 ± 1.636.078.6 ± 4.70.040 ± 0.001WT55.8 ± 6.2‡39.6 ± 1.7‡35.082.8 ± 3.9‡0.048 ± 0.001‡Loop 352.8 ± 5.8‡36.6 ± 1.5‡35.082.2 ± 6.4‡0.034 ± 0.001‡R94D71.0 ± 6.4*46.4 ± 1.7‡42.880.3 ± 6.1‡0.032 ± 0.001‡FVIIEGF210.6 ± 3.4*8.7 ± 0.7*6.469.6 ± 9.2‡0.016 ± 0.001*Loop 117.5 ± 3.9*12.3 ± 0.8*13.660.1 ± 5.9‡0.015 ± 0.001*Loop 213.7 ± 3.7*10.5 ± 0.7*5.475.6 ± 9.1‡0.024 ± 0.001§Loop 1 G94R15.6 ± 5.9*13.2 ± 1.3*11.888.8 ± 12.9‡0.011 ± 0.001*Values are mean ± S.E.M.

https://openalex.org/W2008459522,"The magnitude of agonist-induced Ca2+ sensitization of force is tissue-dependent, but an explanation for this diversity is unknown. Ca2+ sensitization is thought to involve a G-protein-mediated inhibition of myosin light chain phosphatase activity by phosphorylation of the myosin-targeting subunit (MYPT). The MYPT has two isoforms that differ by a central insert, which lies near this phosphorylation site. Expression of MYPT isoforms is both developmentally regulated and tissue-specific. We hypothesized that the presence or absence of the central insert determines the magnitude of agonist-induced Ca2+ sensitization. Throughout development, the chicken aorta exclusively expresses the splice-in MYPT isoform, and guanosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate) (GTPγS) produces a significant force enhancement. Early during development, the chicken gizzard expresses the splice-in MYPT isoform, and GTPγS produced a Ca2+ sensitization. In the gizzard coincident with the shift in expression from the splice-in to splice-out MYPT isoform, GTPγS no longer produced force enhancement. In addition, adenosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate) (ATPγS) phosphorylated only adult gizzard tissue, the only tissue that did not demonstrate a Ca2+ sensitization. These results suggest that the relative expression of splice-in/splice-out MYPT isoforms determines the magnitude of agonist-induced force enhancement and that MYPT phosphorylation is not required for Ca2+sensitization."
https://openalex.org/W2131404749,"Osteoprotegerin ligand (OPGL, also known as RANKL), a member of the tumor necrosis factor superfamily, is essential for mammary gland development during pregnancy in addition to key roles in the immune system and bone development. Here we show that OPGL induces β-casein transcription through the CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein β (C/EBPβ). In both HC11 cell lines and primary mammary epithelial cells, OPGL stimulation triggers rapid nuclear translocation of C/EBPβ, which is critical for the expression of the β-casein gene. Mutation of C/EBPβ binding sites in the β-casein gene promoter completely abrogated OPGL-induced β-casein promoter activity. By contrast, OPGL stimulation did not result in STAT5 phosphorylation. <i>In vivo</i> immunohistochemistry studies further demonstrated defective nuclear translocation of C/EBPβ, but normal STAT5 activation, in OPGL-deficient mice. These data show that OPGL is a critical activator of β-casein gene expression via the transcription factor C/EBPβ. Our data provide new insights into the understanding of the molecular events involved in milk protein gene expression."
