https://openalex.org/W2005843269,Angiotensin II applied directly to the subfornical organ in a dose as small as 0.1 nanogram elicited short-latency drinking behavior in water-sated rats. Lesions in the body of this structure blocked drinking induced by angiotensin II applied to the basal telencephalon (including preoptic area). These results call attention to the subfornical organ as an important central nervous structure involved in the control of drinking behavior.

This binding protein is specific for 17β-estradiol and has a Kd equal to 2.5 nm, a sedimentation constant of 4.0 S (and 9.2 S), and a mechanism capable of transporting the 17β-estradiol into the nucleus."
https://openalex.org/W1566559214,"Abstract After administration of estradiol to castrated guinea pigs, a rise in the uterine concentration of specific progesterone binding sites (receptor) was observed as early as at 6 hours, and the peak of concentration (8-fold over basal values) was obtained within approximately 24 hours. The effect of the estrogen was prevented by RNA and protein synthesis inhibitors administered 15 min before estrogen. On the other hand, these compounds had no effect when administered 20 hours after estradiol. These results were obtained by using animals with a stable low concentration of receptor (as observed after castration of the cycling guinea pig at diestrus, a time when the concentration is the lowest). From the rate of the decay of binding site concentration during a period of time when no more synthesis of the receptor occurs, the approximate half-life of the receptor was found to be 5 days. When progesterone was administered 20 hours after the estrogen, it provoked a rapid fall in receptor concentration, so that less than 20% remained 1 day after the injection. This decrease was neither due to masking by unlabeled progesterone nor due to the accumulation of receptor-steroid complexes in the nucleus. The progesterone effect was not prevented by protein synthesis inhibitors. After hormone injection, there were also variations in the sedimentation coefficient of the progesterone receptor. After estradiol, initially only the 4.5 S form increased, but secondarily the 6.7 S receptor became predominant. During the decay in receptor concentration, the 6.7 S binder disappeared faster, so that 7 days after estrogen injection equal amounts of both molecular forms were observed. These data suggest that the progesterone receptor in the guinea pig uterus is under a double control: a positive control by estrogen, requiring RNA and protein synthesis, and a negative control by progesterone, possibly due to an increased inactivation rate. In vitro experiments have indicated that the rate of inactivation of receptor molecules located in the nuclei is faster than that of the cytosol receptor. The relevance of this observation to the physiological situation, however, is still undecided. The effects of estradiol and progesterone on progesterone receptor content in the uterus are compatible with the cyclic changes observed physiologically in intact animals. It is not known whether these changes in the concentration of uterine receptor are due to molecular variations in individual cells or to variations in cell population."
https://openalex.org/W1574770390,"Abstract Homogenates of rat fat cells were separated into three fractions by centrifugation: P1 (sedimented at 10,000 x g for 7 min), P2 (sedimented from the 10,000 x g supernatant after 20 min at 100,000 x g), and S (the 100,000 x g supernatant). All fractions contained adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate (cAMP) phosphodiesterase activity. The S fraction was enriched in higher Km (∼15 µm) phosphodiesterase and the P2 fraction in low Km (∼0.2 µm) activity, although both exhibited two apparent Michaelis constants for cAMP. When assayed with 62 nm cAMP, the specific activity of P2 was 2 to 3 times that of the unfractionated homogenate, and this fraction contained more than one-half the total phosphodiesterase activity. Incubation of fat cells with 1.0 milliunit per ml of insulin invariably increased the phosphodiesterase activity assayed in homogenates with l10 µm cAMP. The increment in activity was for the most part confined to the P2 fraction, the specific activity of which was increased 71 ± 5.5% (mean ± S.E.) in 24 experiments. The specific activity of 5'-AMP nucleotidase in P2 (which was 3 to 4 times that in the whole homogenate) was not altered by insulin. The effect on phosphodiesterase activity was essentially maximal after exposure of cells to insulin, 1 milliunit per ml, for 6 to 8 min. It was not diminished by washing the cells four times without insulin but was completely reversed by incubation for 30 min without insulin after washing. Neither prostaglandin E1, 2.8 µm, nor nicotinic acid, 10 µm, mimicked the effect of insulin on fat cell phosphodiesterase activity. The effect of insulin was prevented by anti-insulin serum and insulin treated with dithiothreitol was inactive. When present in the phosphodiesterase assay, dithiothreitol, 0.0042 to 4.2 mm, increased the activity of both P2 and S fractions isolated from control cells, whereas heparin, 8.4 to 420 ng per ml, and ethylene glycol bis(β-aminoethyl ether-N,N'-tetraacetic acid (EGTA), 0.05 to 2.0 mm, increased P2 activity with little or no effect on the activity of the supernatant fraction. Dithiothreitol, heparin, and EGTA increased, and sodium deoxycholate, 25 to 850 µg per ml, inhibited the activity of P2 fractions isolated from control and insulin-treated cells. Triton X-100, 0.0025 to 0.25%, was without effect. Incubation at 45° for 5 min reduced the phosphodiesterase activity of P2 fractions from control and insulin-treated cells to the same level which was about 50% of the initial control value. The activities then were stable for at least 25 min at 45°. Treatment of rats with dexamethasone for 20 hours decreased the phosphodiesterase activity of the isolated fat cells. The decrement in activity of whole homogenates was apparently accounted for by a loss of activity in the P2 fraction. These observations are consistent with the view that the effects of insulin and perhaps corticosteroids on cAMP-mediated processes in fat cells may be the result of alterations in the activity of a membrane-associated phosphodiesterase which has a relatively high affinity for cAMP."

https://openalex.org/W1501732289,"Abstract Infection of HeLa cells with herpes simplex virus leads to a large increase in a new DNA polymerase activity in the nucleus of infected cells. This herpes simplex virus-induced DNA polymerase has been purified 400- to 1300-fold from infected cells and shown to be different in its properties from the normal host cell DNA polymerases. The herpes simplex virus-induced DNA polymerase can be eluted as two peaks of activity on DEAE-cellulose in the presence of glycerol. However, these two DNA polymerase activities seem to have the same molecular weight (1.8 x 105) and exhibit similar properties after further purification on phosphocellulose. The herpes simplex virus-induced DNA polymerase is markedly different from the host DNA polymerases in its high salt requirement for maximal activity. It shows a strong preference for an oligomer-homopolymer template containing deoxyguanylate and deoxycytidylate. A nuclease activity which degrades the polydeoxyadenylate-deoxythymidylate copolymer and the deoxyguanylate-deoxycytidylate homopolymer pair is found to co-chromatograph with the herpes simplex virus-induced DNA polymerase."
https://openalex.org/W1516831950,"Abstract A hypothalamic tripeptide, thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH), causes an increase in the rate of synthesis of prolactin by GH3 cells, a clonal strain of rat pituitary cells grown in culture. This cell system has been used to study the initial interaction between TRH and prolactin-producing cells. Tritiated TRH binds to a limited number of sites on GH3 cells, but TRH does not bind to control cell strains which do not respond biologically to the neurohormone. Half-maximum binding of TRH to GH3 cells occurs at a TRH concentration of 11 nm, while a half-maximum biological response to TRH, an increase in prolactin production, is obtained at a concentration of 2 nm. A maximum of 1.1 pmoles of TRH is bound per mg of GH3 cell protein, equivalent to 130,000 TRH receptors per cell. Initially the binding of TRH to GH3 cells is reversible, but it becomes irreversible over the ensuing 24-hour period. Binding of TRH to receptors has been studied in GH3 cell homogenates using a filter assay technique. At 0°, the dissociation constant of the TRH-GH3 receptor complex is 25 nm, and there is 0.75 pmole of TRH receptors per mg of GH3 cell protein. The halftime for the dissociation of the TRH-GH3 receptor complex is 2 to 3 hours. The binding of TRH to the GH3 receptor has a pH optimum of 7.5, does not require the presence of divalent cations, and is inhibited by high concentrations of calcium ion. We conclude that the action of TRH on GH3 cells involves an initial binding of the tripeptide to specific receptors."
https://openalex.org/W1519118419,"Abstract Two independent effects of guanyl nucleotides are observed on the activity and response of fat cell adenylate cyclase to hormones (glucagon, adrenocorticotropin, and epinephrine). GTP inhibits markedly basal activity, giving maximal effects at 10-6 m, in either fat cell ghosts or highly purified plasma membranes prepared from rat adipocytes. Inhibition was unaffected by the concentration of ATP used as substrate. Activity in the presence of hormones or fluoride ion is less inhibited by GTP, resulting in enhanced activation ratios (stimulant to basal activities). ITP at 50 times the concentration of GTP also inhibits activity. When present at 0.01 mm, guanosine 3':5'-monophosphate, 5'-GMP, UTP, and CTP do not alter adenylate cyclase activity or response to the stimulants. The terminal labile phosphate of GTP is required for inhibition since Gpp(NH)p, the terminal phosphate of which is not hydrolyzed by the membranes, and GDP do not inhibit adenylate cyclase activity. In the absence of a regenerating system, the inhibitory effect of GTP is transient, indicating that continuous presence of GTP is required for inhibition and that this effect is reversible. It is suggested that the fat cell plasma membrane contains an enzyme that transfers the terminal phosphate of GTP to the catalytic component of the enzyme resulting in an inhibited state of the enzyme. GTP also converts the enzyme into a state that is thermally stable to temperatures of 45° and which exhibits marked increases specifically in hormonal responses. It is not certain whether this effect is due to GTP or GDP produced during incubation. GDP enhances by 2-fold the activation of adenylate cyclase by adrenocorticotropin; this effect is mimicked by GTP under conditions in which it is rapidly hydrolyzed to GDP. Gpp(NH)p also enhances the effects of the hormones. It is suggested that the inhibitory effects of GTP on basal activity combined with the stimulatory effect of GDP on hormone action may play an important regulatory role in the fat cell by inhibiting the production of adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate by adenylate cyclase in the absence of the lipolytic hormones and by enhancing the responsiveness of the system to these hormones."
https://openalex.org/W1495169618,"Abstract The gonadal receptor for luteinizing hormone LH and chorionic gonadotropin was extracted in soluble form from a particulate binding fraction of the interstitial cells of the rat testis by treatment with the nonionic detergent Triton X-100. During binding studies with the soluble receptor and 125I-labeled human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), receptor-bound and free forms of the hormone were separated by a double precipitation procedure with polyethylene glycol. The soluble gonadotropin receptors retained hormonal specificity and high affinity for LH and hCG, and showed rapid and reversible gonadotropin binding during incubation with 10-11 m 125I-hCG. The initial rate of binding of hCG by soluble receptors was higher at 34° than at 24° or 4°, but degradation of receptors occurred more rapidly at the higher temperature with corresponding loss of binding activity. The equilibrium association constant of the soluble hormone-receptor complex at 24° (0.5 to 1 x 1010 m-1) was detectably lower than that of the particulate receptors for hCG (2.4 x 1010 m-1). The optimum pH for gonadotropin binding was 7.4, and no effects of buffer composition, ionic strength, or calcium concentration upon binding were demonstrable. Exposure of particulate and soluble receptors to trypsin caused loss of gonadotropin binding activity, indicating the protein nature of an essential component of the receptor site. In addition, a significant role of phospholipid in the structural and functional properties of the receptor was suggested by the reduced binding activity observed after treatment of particulate and soluble receptors with phospholipase A, and by the aggregation which occurred after exposure of the soluble receptors to phospholipase C. Gel filtration and density gradient centrifugation of the free receptors, and the receptor-hormone complex formed by equilibration of the soluble receptors with 125I-hCG, were performed in solutions containing 0.1% Triton. The soluble receptor and receptor-hormone complex showed adsorption to Sepharose 6B during gel filtration, and were quantitatively bound by blue dextran. For these reasons, blue dextran could not be used as a front marker during gel filtration studies, and 0.01% bovine serum albumin was included in buffers employed for chromatography on Sepharose 6B. The distribution coefficient (Kav) of the receptorhormone complex on Sephadex G-200 was 0.09, and that of free hCG was 0.33. On columns of Sepharose 6B, the Kav of the free receptors and the receptor-hormone complex was 0.32, and that of free hCG was 0.56. By reference to the behavior of standard proteins during filtration on Sepharose 6B, the hydrodynamic radius of the receptor was calculated to be 64 A. Sucrose density gradient centrifugation showed that the sedimentation constant of the free receptor was 6.5 S, and that of the hormone-receptor complex was 7.5 S. Dialysis of the complex to remove Triton X-100 caused conversion to an 8.8 S form, but no aggregation occurred. The density of the 7.5 S hormone-receptor complex in cesium chloride gradients was 1.289. From these values, the molecular weights of the 6.5 S (free) and 7.5 S (combined) forms of the receptor were calculated to be 194,000 and 224,000, respectively, and the axial ratios (prolate) of the two forms were 12 and 10.2, respectively. The properties of the gonadotropin receptor extracted by Triton X-100 were consistent with those of a highly asymmetric molecule, predominantly of protein nature, with a minor but functionally important phospholipid component. The retention of high specificity and affinity by the solubilized gonadotropin receptors indicates that the receptor macromolecules possess relatively high conformational stability, and provides an approach to the structural analysis of the hormone binding site."
https://openalex.org/W1547169091,"Abstract The interactions of glutamate metabolism with transport steps across the mitochondrial membrane and enzyme steps of the citric acid cycle have been investigated in rat heart mitochondria in order to elucidate factors regulating transfer of reducing equivalents into mitochondria via the malateaspartate cycle. With glutamate as substrate, net efflux of α-ketoglutarate from the mitochondria in State 3 was stimulated by addition of extramitochondrial malate, the concentration for a half-maximal effect being 0.36 ± 0.07 mm. Stimulation of α-ketoglutarate-malate exchange by a decrease of the malate gradient resulted in a fall of the intramitochondrial α-ketoglutarate concentration and diminished flux through α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase. A value of 0.67 mm for the apparent Km of α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase for α-ketoglutarate was calculated from these data. Glutamate transamination was inhibited in the uncoupled state and the intramitochondrial aspartate content increased up to 20-fold. The increased aspartate gradient across the mitochondrial membrane observed in the energy-depleted state was abolished, while aspartate efflux and glutamate transamination were restored either by direct addition of ATP or by addition of acetylcarnitine to increase substrate level phosphorylation. These effects were prevented by oligomycin, indicating that activation of aspartate efflux required energy in a form closely associated with the energy transfer reactions of oxidative phosphorylation. Regulation of flux through citrate synthase, aspartate aminotransferase, and α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase as a function of the state of phosphorylation of the mitochondrial adenine nucleotides was investigated at high NADH:NAD ratios produced by State 4 and oligomycin inhibition, and at low NADH:NAD ratios produced by addition of uncoupling agents in the presence and absence of oligomycin. Acetylcarnitine and acetoacetate were used to provide sources of intramitochondrial acetyl coenzyme A. The following conclusions may be drawn from the data. In addition to the malate concentration gradient, net α-ketoglutarate efflux is regulated by the rate of generation of intramitochondrial α-ketoglutarate relative to the activity of α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase as determined by product inhibition. Flux through α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase was inhibited at high ATP:ADP ratios due to the high succinyl-CoA to CoA ratio, with the inhibition potentiated by an increase of the NADH:NAD ratio and relieved by an increased availability of intramitochondrial α-ketoglutarate. Production of α-ketoglutarate via citrate synthase was also regulated by the phosphorylation state of the intramitochondrial adenine nucleotides as indicated by succinyl-CoA inhibition rather than by direct ATP inhibition. Since inhibition of citrate synthase by succinyl-CoA has been shown to be competitive with acetyl-CoA, it is proposed that regulation is exerted by changes of the succinyl-CoA to acetyl-CoA ratio. This regulation is complementary to control of oxalacetate availability by the intramitochondrial NADH:NAD ratio which also regulates α-ketoglutarate production via both citrate synthase and aspartate aminotransferase. Coordination of flux between enzymes which produce intramitochondrial α-ketoglutarate, namely citrate synthase and aspartate aminotransferase, and α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase which utilizes it, is determined by complex feedback relationships regulated indirectly both by the ATP:ADP ratio and the NADH:NAD ratio. These provide great flexibility to regulation of the over-all malate-aspartate cycle by controlling efflux of α-ketoglutarate from the mitochondria."
https://openalex.org/W1546087498,"Abstract The observed standard free energy change (ΔG0obs) for the hydrolysis of the terminal pyrophosphate bond of ATP has been experimentally determined under physiological conditions using an entirely new set of reactions. The observed equilibrium constant (Kobs) for the combined reactions of acetate kinase (EC 2.7.2.1) and phosphate acetyltransferase (EC 2.3.1.8) has been determined at 38°, pH 7.0, ionic strength 0.25, and varying free [Mg2+]. The Kobs of these combined reactions reflects the difference between ΔG0obs for the hydrolysis of acetyl-CoA and the ΔG0obs for the hydrolysis of ATP. Using Σ and square brackets to indicate total concentration, Kobs = [ΣADP][ΣPi]/[ΣATP] x [Acetyl-CoA]/[ΣAcetate][CoA] The observed value of this combined equilibrium constant varies with free [Mg2+], being 0.984 ± 0.009 when [Mg2+] = 0 and 0.218 ± 0.002 when free [Mg2+] = 10-3 m. The ΔG0obs for the hydrolysis of acetyl-CoA is virtually unaffected by the free [Mg2+] and has been previously determined to be -8.54 Cal per mole (-35.75 kJ per mole) under the same conditions of temperature, pH, and ionic strength. Therefore at pH 7.0, at ionic strength 0.25, at 38°, and taking the standard state of liquid water to have activity = unity ([H2O] = 1) the ΔG0obs for the reaction [see PDF for equation] can be calculated to be -8.53 Cal per mole (-35.69 kJ per mole) at [Mg2+] = 0 and -7.60 Cal per mole (-31.80 kJ per mole) at [Mg2+] = 10-3 m. The corresponding values of Kobs for the ATP hydrolysis reaction are 9.86 x 105 m ([Mg2+] = 0) and 2.19 x 105 m ([Mg2+] = 10-3 m). Equations have been developed for calculating from the experimental data the ΔG0obs of ATP hydrolysis at different free magnesium and hydrogen ion concentrations. The Kobs of ATP hydrolysis has been used in combination with the Kobs of the citrate synthase reaction (EC 4.1.3.7) to calculate the Kobs of the ATP-citrate lyase reaction (EC 4.1.3.8) Kobs = [ΣADP][Acetyl-CoA] [ΣPi] [ΣOxaloacetate]/[ΣATP] [CoA] [ΣCitrate] Under the same near physiological conditions of 38°, pH 7.0, and ionic strength 0.25, the value of Kobs for the ATP-citrate lyase reaction was found to be very sensitive to the free [Mg2+], being 0.975 m at [Mg2+] = 0 and 0.0985 m when free [Mg2+] = 10-3 m."

https://openalex.org/W1534314602,"Abstract The preparation, testing, and use of a variety of estradiol-containing agarose supports for affinity chromatography of estrogen receptors from crude extracts of calf uterus are described. Before use the gels must be washed exhaustively with organic solvents over prolonged periods of time. The adequacy of the washing procedures must be tested by examining the effluents of chromatographed uterine extracts for free estradiol as well as for soluble estradiol-receptor complexes. Even complete removal of the non-covalently adsorbed hormone may not safeguard against the release of hormone during the purification procedures, since certain estradiol-containing adsorbents possess chemical linkages which are susceptible to accelerated cleavage by reducing substances and nucleophiles present in the crude uterine extracts. The release of hormone from the gel into the medium does not necessarily exclude effective adsorption of receptors onto the adsorbent; whether this occurs will depend on the relative affinities and concentrations of the gel-bound and free hormone molecules. Receptor molecules specifically extracted by affinity adsorbents can be eluted from the gels in high yield by incubating the gel, in suspension, with estradiol-containing buffers at 30°; the conditions utilized enhance the rate of dissociation of gel-bound receptors and favor an effective exchange of these receptors with the soluble estradiol molecules. Various agarose derivatives containing estradiol covalently bound through linkages with the A ring of the steroid molecules are ineffective as adsorbents for receptors. Similar kinds of adsorbents prepared on glass and polyacrylamide supports proved to be inferior to those which utilize agarose. Although agarose derivatives containing 19-nortestosterone 17-hemisuccinate can selectively bind estradiol receptors, the capacity of these columns is low. The most effective affinity adsorbents were prepared by attaching 17β-estradiol 17-hemisuccinate to agarose derivatives containing albumin or the branched copolymer of poly(l-lysine) (backbone) and poly(dl-alanine) (side arms). These macromolecular leashes are presumably bound to the agarose matrix by multipoint attachments, they possess numerous functional groups which permit a high degree of ligand substitution, and the attached ligand is very distant from the agarose backbone. Some of these adsorbents are so effective that significant extraction of receptors occurs even when the gels are diluted 100-fold with unsubstituted agarose. Adsorbents diluted in this way can be used routinely in purification procedures, since selective adsorption of receptors in excess of 90% can be achieved. Furthermore, the complications of washing the gels are diminished, nonspecific adsorption of non-receptor proteins is minimal, and elution of the adsorbed receptors is facilitated. Uterine estradiol receptors (4.5 S) from crude uterine supernatants can be purified between 10,000- and 100,000-fold in over-all yields of 30 to 50% in a single step. The purified receptors are identical with those described earlier by molecular size (gel filtration), sedimentation coefficient, isoelectric focusing, and heat stability."
https://openalex.org/W1514785179,"Rat brain microsomes were shown to acylate 1-acylglycerophosphorylinositol (1-acylGPI) when incubated with radioactive fatty acids, ATP, CoA and MgCl2, or with chemically synthesized acyl esters of CoA. Both acylation systems showed a concentration dependence on added lysolipid acceptor and free fatty acids, cofactors, or CoA esters. With free fatty acids, relative acylation rates varied with concentration of lysolipid; at low levels arachidonate, linoleate, and oleate were superior to palmitate and stearate, but at higher levels the differential was greatly reduced. With CoA esters, acylation of 1-acylGPI was determined either spectrophotometrically or by measuring radioactivity incorporated from 14C- or 3H-labeled acyl-CoA. The radioassay showed that a large proportion of acyl groups was incorporated into polyphosphoinositides, principally phosphatidylinositol phosphate, as well as phosphatidylinositol, possibly as a result of the concerted action of acyltransferase and membrane-bound phosphatidylinositol kinase. Acylation rates were much higher with acyl-CoA esters than with free fatty acids and cofactors. The most striking feature was that rates with arachidonoyl-CoA were 2 to 5 times higher than with linoleoyl-, linolenoyl-, or eicosatrienoyl-CoA and 5 to 10 times higher compared with oleoyl- and docosahexaenoyl-CoA. Positional analysis of the labeled products with snake venom phospholipase A2 showed that unsaturated acyl groups were incorporated almost exclusively into the 2-position of inositol lipid but 25 to 30% of radioactivity from palmitoyl- and stearoyl-CoA appeared in the 1-position, indicating that some isomerization of the lysolipid acceptor had occurred. Maximal acylation of 1-acylglycerophosphorylcholine (1-acylGPC) occurred under conditions similar to that for the inositol lipid, but a somewhat different selectivity was shown. Acylation rates with 1-acylGPC were the same or higher than for the inositol lipid except with arachidonoyl-CoA, where the rate with 1-acylGPI was 2 to 3 times higher than with 1-acylGPC. It is suggested that the acylation of 1-acylGPI constitutes an important and highly selective mechanism for achieving the strict species specificity exhibited by inositides in rat brain. The marked difference in acylation rates between arachidonoyl-CoA (20:4, n-6) and eicosatrienoyl-CoA (20:3, n-6) indicates that the double bond between carbons 5 and 6 may be critical in directing enzyme selectivity for arachidonoyl-CoA."

https://openalex.org/W1570108550,"Abstract A fraction characterized as membrane-bound polysomes has been isolated from homogenates of 14-day-old chick embryo tibiae and other connective tissues by centrifugation between 700 to 15,000 x g. These polysomes, as well as free polysomes isolated by further centrifugation at 105,000 x g, synthesize collagen and noncollagen protein in a cell-free system, but the membrane-bound polysomes contain 70 to 90% of the collagen-synthesizing activity. Electron micrographs of the 15,000 x g pellet revealed vesicles of the endoplasmic reticulum with ribosomes attached to the surface. Homogenization in the presence of detergent resulted in disruption of these vesicles with formation of free polysomes. This conclusion was based on electron microscopy of the fractions and on the observation that collagen-synthesizing activity was lost from the 15,000 x g pellet derived from homogenates prepared with detergent but was recovered by centrifugation at 105,000 x g. Approximately 80% of the protein synthesized by membrane-bound polysomes in the cell-free system remained attached to the ribosomes; the remainder was released either into the soluble fraction or into the cisternae of the endoplasmic reticulum. When membrane-bound polysomes were labeled with [14C]proline and reisolated free of soluble fraction, hydroxylation of proline in collagen-nascent chains could be obtained merely by incubating with ascorbate, Fe2+, and α-ketoglutarate, indicating that prolyl hydroxylase was present in the membrane-polysome complex. When free polysomes released by detergent were prelabeled with [14C]proline, reisolated, and incubated with hydroxylase cofactors, no hydroxylation of proline was obtained. Our results suggest that collagen is synthesized almost entirely on polysomes bound to the membranes of the endoplasmic reticulum and that prolyl hydroxylase may also be attached to these membranes. The location of the enzyme may serve to regulate the entry of collagen into the endoplasmic reticulum."

https://openalex.org/W1481832594,"Abstract Electron paramagnetic resonance spectra of Mn(II) bound to pyruvate kinase and its substrate and inhibitor complexes are examined in solution. The binary complex of Mn(II) with the enzyme gives a spectrum which indicates that the electronic symmetry of the bound cation is only moderately distorted upon liganding to the protein. The spectrum of the binary enzyme-Mn(II) complex is unaltered upon formation of ternary complexes with either ADP or ATP. However, when ternary complexes are formed with either pyruvate or P-enolpyruvate, there are gross changes in the position and shape of the spectral lines which correlate with changes in the electronic symmetry of the bound Mn(II) and the electron spin relaxation time, respectively. The former changes are indicative of changes in the ligands of the bound metal ion and the latter of the accessibility of the binding site to the bulk solvent. Minor changes are observed in the spectrum of the pyruvate complex upon addition of ATP or enzymatic enolization cofactors such as arsenate or inorganic phosphate. Preliminary studies of Mn(II) complexes with chelating agents have revealed a striking similarity in spectra for the 2:1 complex of iminodiacetic acid and Mn(II) and the ternary complex of manganese-pyruvate kinase and pyruvate. Neither the spectrum of the binary complex nor that of the ternary complex with pyruvate is influenced by the presence or absence of activating monovalent cations such as K+. In contrast, spectra for the ternary complex of P-enolpyruvate are influenced by the species of monovalent cation in solution. In the presence of the nonactivating tetramethylammonium cation, the spectrum for the P-enolpyruvate ternary complex is a superposition of spectra for two distinct species. One species gives a very anisotropic spectrum which resembles that obtained in the presence of K+, whereas the other species gives a much more isotropic spectrum which matches the spectrum for the ternary complex of the inhibitor, α-(dihydroxyphosphinylmethyl) acrylic acid. Higher temperatures favor the species with the anisotropic spectrum. Ternary complexes with the inhibitor, P-glycolate, and the pseudosubstrate, Z-P-enol-3-fluoropyruvate, give spectra which show the presence of two separate species in the presence of tetramethylammonium cations in analogy to the substrate P-enolpyruvate. Another pseudosubstrate, Z-P-enol-α-ketobutyrate, gives only the anisotropic spectrum in the presence of either tetramethylammonium or K+ cations. The presence of only one form of the ternary complex in the presence of tetramethylammonium ion with this weak substrate is attributed to steric restrictions imposed by the methyl group. With the normal substrate, P-enolpyruvate, the fraction of the ternary complex which exists in the anisotropic form for a given monovalent ion appears to be correlated with the activating effect that ion, being greatest for K+ and Rb+, intermediate for Na+ and Li+, and least for tetramethylammonium ion."

Radioactivity in the cytosol appeared to be unbound oxytocin, as determined by gel filtration on Sephadex G-100. Oxytocin was distributed about equally among the three particulate fractions and could not be correlated with either the amount of protein or the enzymes putatively characteristic of cell membranes, mitochondria, or microsomes. [3H]Oxytocin, added directly to particles sedimenting between 1,000 and 20,000 x g, was bound with an apparent Kd of 7.6 x 10-10 m under optimal conditions; 0.28 pmole of oxytocin was bound per mg of protein. Binding was maximal in 1 hour at 20°. The affinities of synthetic analogues of oxytocin, [4-threonine]oxytocin g oxytocin g [8-valine]oxytocin g [8-lysine]vasopressin g [4-proline]oxytocin, paralleled their milk-ejecting activities in rat mammary tissue. [3H]Oxytocin did not appear to be metabolized during incubation. Binding was enhanced by Mn2+ and Co2+ g Mg2+ g Zn2+ and was absent in the presence of 1 mm ethylenediaminetetraacetate. Ca2+, 50 mm, did not affect binding nor did 100 mm NaCl, LiCl, or KCl. Binding in 50 mm Tris-maleate buffer, containing 20 mm Mn2+, was optimum at pH 7.6. Trypsin depressed binding about 30%; phospholipases A, C, and D and neuraminidase did not. Sulfhydryl reagents such as N-ethylmaleimide and iodoacetate did not inhibit binding whereas p-hydroxymercuribenzoate did. Butanedione and sodium fluoride did not affect binding. Binding was markedly depressed by 1 mm ATP but not by guanosine triphosphate, cytosine triphosphate, hypoxanthine triphosphate, or uridine triphosphate. The binding material in the 20,000 x g particles of mammary tissue presumably is part of the oxytocin-receptor system because binding specificity paralleled biological specificity, and the high affinity of the binding sites for oxytocin is commensurate with physiological levels of the hormone. The receptor must be a protein, at least in part, because of its susceptibility to trypsin and p-hydroxymercuribenzoate."

In this form it degrades native collagen in helical conformation at 37 degrees C, pH 7.6, into two fragments, but it had little capacity to cleave gelatin, an indication of the importance of higher-order structure of substrate for this enzyme in pure form. It is likely that, in vivo, enzymes other than collagenase degrade gelatin polypeptides produced by primary collagenolysis."

https://openalex.org/W2014997990,Intravenous bicuculline was used to examine how removing gamma-aminobutyric acid-mediated inhibition affects the visual response properties of single cortical neurons. Simple neurons were depressed and complex neurons showed increase in the vigor and range of responses. Hypercomplex cells were no longer inhibited by elongated stimuli. The results are consistent with present evidence concerning the origin and distribution of inhibitory connections within the cortex.
https://openalex.org/W1556268921,"Cultured human diploid fibroblasts were labeled with [3H]-tryptophan, and the three-chain precursor of collagen in the medium was identified by immunoprecipitation and gel electrophoresis. [3H]Tryptophan was incorporated into the nonhelical, NH2-terminal extensions of the pro-α1 and pro-α2 chains of the precursor. Collagenase digestion of the helical segment of the precursor molecule left intact a disulfide-assembled protein fragment which contained all of the incorporated radioactivity. Reduction and alkylation of the fragment confirmed that it consisted of three chains of similar molecular weight. Large scale recovery of the labeled fragment was performed using gel filtration, collagenase digestion, and ion exchange chromatography. Immune precipitation showed that the isolated fragment was still antigenically reactive. The molecular weights of the fragment and its constituent chains were determined from their electrophoretic mobilities in sodium dodecyl sulfatepolyacrylamide gels, from their elution positions in Sephadex gels, and by analytical ultracentrifugation. The latter two methods gave a molecular weight of 75,000 to 80,000 for the intact fragment and 25,000 for the component chains released by reduction. The electrophoretic data gave somewhat higher molecular weights, which were judged to be anomalous. The fragment had an amino acid composition quite different from that of collagen: it was poorer in glycine and proline, it contained half-cystine residues, and 23% of its residues were derived from aspartate and glutamate."

https://openalex.org/W1601334110,"Abstract The nucleotide sequence of T4 tRNAleu, one of several transfer RNAs specifically coded for by bacteriophage T4, has been determined using 32P-labeled material from T4-infected cultures of Escherichia coli. The purified RNA species which has been sequenced has been shown to have leucine acceptor activity, and to hybridize well to T4 DNA. The sequence is: pGCGAGAAUGGUCAAADDGmGDAAAGGCACAGCACUNAAA * A ψ GCUGCGGAAUGAUUUCCUUGUGGGTψCGAGUCCCACUUCUCGCACCA—OH. The 87 nucleotide length is the same as that of the two E. coli leucine tRNAs, the sequences of which have been reported. The molecule can be arranged in the classic cloverleaf pattern. The sequence further shows that the anticodon of the T4 tRNAleu is -N-A-A-, in which N is a modified form of U. Thus, the molecule might be expected to recognize the leucine codons UUA or UUG, or both together, but trinucleotide binding studies by Scherberg and Weiss ((1972) Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 69, 114) indicate that it recognizes only UUA."

https://openalex.org/W1491998032,"Abstract A chromosomal pleiotropic respiratory-deficient mutant has been obtained by x-irradiation of a petite-negative yeast species: Schizosaccharomyces pombe 972h-. This mutant, called M126, does not grow on glycerol medium and lacks antimycin A-sensitive respiration. It possesses the following mitochondrial enzymes: cytochrome c, cytochrome c1, succinate:phenazine methosulfate oxidoreductase (EC 1.3.99.1), and Dio-9-sensitive ATPase (ATP phosphohydrolase, EC 3.6.13). There was a decrease of more than 95% in cytochrome oxidase (ferricytochrome c:oxygen oxidoreductase, EC 1.9.3.1), succinate:cytochrome c oxidoreductase (EC 1.3.99.1), and oligomycin-sensitive ATPase. The cytochrome a + a3 absorption peak was not detectable. The cytochrome b 560 absorption peak was markedly decreased but detectable in the mutant. The mutant Dio-9-sensitive ATPase activity was recovered mainly in the postribosomal supernatant, suggesting that the binding of ATPase to the mitochondrial membrane is weakened. The Dio-9-sensitive ATPase purified from mutant submitochondrial particles reacts like the wild type enzyme to anions, cations, inhibitors, and low temperature. Both purified ATPases show five subunits of the following molecular weights: 61,000, 58,000 32,000, 14,000, and 8,000. The addition of chloramphenicol and ethidium bromide to the wild type produces pleiotropic phenotypes which show several similarities to that of the mutant. However, the cycloheximide-resistant incorporation of leucine by the mutant is significantly decreased by ethidium bromide. Genetic analyses show that the mutation is of chromosomal origin and that only one gene or a few closely linked genes are modified. These data suggest that the mutation affects a chromosomal DNA product involved in a central process of mitochondrial biogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1484180580,"Abstract 1. Amino acid uptake in vitro by jejunal mucosa was stimulated by the addition of adenosine cyclic 3':5'-monophosphate (cyclic AMP), dibutyryl cyclic AMP, theophylline, and cholera toxin. This stimulation appeared to be specific for neutral and dibasic amino acids, since the uptake of iminoamino acids and 3-O-methylglucose was unaffected. 2. The enhanced uptake correlated positively with tissue cyclic AMP levels but not with cyclic GMP. Kinetic studies demonstrated a decrease in Kt. There was cross-inhibition between lysine and leucine for the stimulated (but not for unstimulated) uptake. 3. The effect of theophylline was noted only in jejunum and not in ileum. Although ileal cAMP levels rose, neither influx nor efflux of amino acid was affected. 4. The findings suggest that cyclic AMP mediates transport pathways at or near the brush border which are shared in part by dibasic and neutral amino acids."

https://openalex.org/W2130032249,"Abstract In the 250- to 300-nm ultraviolet region, purified ascorbate oxidase exhibits a strong absorption band at 280 nm, having a distinct shoulder absorption at 290 nm. The E1%1 cm (280 nm) value has been found to be 21.7 ± 1.2. In the visible light region, 300 to 1000 nm, ascorbate oxidase exhibits five absorption bands, i.e. at 330, 460, 610, 770, and 880 nm. The extinction coeffients at each wave length have been found to be 2000, 390, 1300, 600, and 560 per g atom copper per liter per cm, respectively. The ratio A280 nm:A610 nm has been found to be 25.6. Purified ascorbate oxidase exhibits a maximal emission spectrum at 325 nm and the fluorescence quantum yield has been calculated to be 0.06. The circular dichroism of ascorbate oxidase in the spectral range of 185 to 240 nm indicates that in 0.01 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.6, ascorbate oxidase exists predominantly in the antiparallel β conformation. As revealed by CD there are at least four transitions in the absorption of the copper chromophore in the spectral range 300 to 700 nm. The absorption and CD spectra of ascorbate oxidase have been examined and compared with those of other copper proteins, and the results support the view that the copper of ascorbate oxidase exists in complex forms. The electron paramagnetic resonance spectrum of ascorbate oxidase is characterized by extremely small low field hyperfine splittings. The gm, g||, and |A| values have been found to be 2.074, 2.244, and 0.006 cm-1, respectively. These and other spectral characteristics of ascorbate oxidase have been found to be very similar to those of other copper proteins particularly ceruloplasmin and laccase, but are distinct from small molecule cupric complexes. The absorption and CD spectra of ascorbate oxidase in the range 400 to 700 nm have been compared and found to be similar to those that have been reported for the model copper (II)-histidine-containing peptide complexes. The spectral data suggest that the copper of ascorbate oxidase is in an environment of low symmetry involving nitrogen atom ligands."
https://openalex.org/W1509996520,"Abstract The steroid substrate-induced difference spectra, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) properties, reduction of cytochrome P-450, and hydroxylation activities were studied in acetone-extracted mitochondrial preparations of bovine adrenal cortex. Cholesterol, 20α-hydroxycholesterol, 22R-hydroxycholesterol, 17α-hydroxypregnenolone, progesterone, deoxycortisol, and deoxycorticosterone all exhibited a type I difference spectrum with characteristic K's values. These preparations were active in side chain cleavage of cholesterol and 20α-hydroxycholesterol, as well as 11β-hydroxylation of deoxycortisol. Additive type I spectral changes were observed with cholesterol and deoxycortisol while competitive inhibition and noncompetitive inhibition were found with cholesterol in the presence of 20α-hydroxycholesterol and pregnenolone, respectively. EPR studies showed a low to high spin transition of Fe3+ in P-450 with cholesterol or 20α-hydroxycholesterol. Preincubation of cholesterol with the acetone powder preparations caused 20α-hydroxycholesterol, 22R-hydroxycholesterol, and pregnenolone to induce the modified type II difference spectra and high to low spin transition in Fe3+ of P-450. A correlation between decreases in low spin signal area and increases in the type I spectral changes was found in cholesterol titration studies. Triton N-101 markedly inhibited the formation of type I difference spectra, the formation of high spin P-450, and the activity of side chain cleavage of cholesterol. The quantitative correlation between these inhibitory effects of Triton N-101 on P-450 suggests that the formation of high spin P-450 by its substrate is an obligatory event in the side chain cleavage of cholesterol. A slow control rate of P-450 reduction by NADPH in the presence of flavoprotein reductase and adrenodoxin was markedly stimulated by all of the substrates tested. The results suggest that substrate-induced high spin formation of P-450 appears to be an essential step for acceptance of reducing equivalents for oxygen activation and hydroxylations of steroid substrates."
https://openalex.org/W1533950787,"Abstract Advantage has been taken of the high sensitivity of the N-methyl-2-anilinonaphthalene-6-sulfonyl (mansyl) group as a fluorescent probe for hydrophobic regions of proteins to study the interaction of pepsin with mansylamide and with several peptides bearing an amino-terminal mansyl group. The data indicate that pepsin has a binding site for mansylamide that is distinct from the substrate-binding region of the enzyme. When a mansyl group is attached to a peptide having an l-phenylalanyl-l-phenylalanyl bond, previously identified as a preferred linkage for attack by pepsin, the fluorescent probe appears to be drawn into a hydrophobic region not evident in the interaction with mansylamide. Upon the addition of pepstatin, a powerful competitive inhibitor of pepsin, the enhancement of the fluorescence of mansylamide is unaffected, but that of the mansyl peptides is reduced to the value for mansylamide. Further evidence for the discrete nature of the binding sites in pepsin for mansylamide and for the mansyl group of peptide substrates is provided by the fact that, upon autocatalytic activation of pepsinogen, the enhancement of the fluorescence of mansylamide is decreased, whereas that of the mansyl peptides is increased; both effects are abolished by pepstatin. Studies on the fluorescence of mansylamide and of mansyl peptides in the presence of pepsin that had been stoichiometrically inactivated by treatment with tosyl-l-phenyl-alanyldiazomethane have shown that this active site-directed inhibitor not only blocks the access of a mansyl peptide substrate to the active site, but also alters the mansylamide-binding site so as to lower its polarity. Further evidence for the conformational flexibility of pepsin suggested by this finding is provided by data on the partially acetylated enzyme, which is more active toward oligopeptide substrates than is pepsin itself. With acetyl-pepsin, the enhancement of the fluorescence of mansyl peptides (but not of mansylamide) is much greater than with untreated pepsin. The addition of pepstatin, however, markedly alters the polarity of the mansylamide-binding site of acetyl-pepsin. Data are presented for the kinetics of the cleavage, by pepsin, of several mansyl peptide substrates. These results, together with those from the fluorescence studies, give further evidence of the importance of secondary interactions of pepsin substrates with the extended active site of the enzyme in influencing catalytic efficiency without marked change in total binding energy. It is difficult to accommodate the findings reported here with a relatively rigid extended active site that can be mapped in terms of subsites; instead, pepsin appears to exhibit considerable conformational flexibility at the active site in response to enzyme-substrate (or enzyme-inhibitor) interaction."
https://openalex.org/W186453495,"Abstract The phosphorylation of lysine-rich (f1) histone at a specific serine residue was studied in the isolated, perfused rat liver. Glucagon and adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate stimulated phosphorylation at this site, confirming that the previously demonstrated stimulatory effect of these agents in intact rats was an effect directly on the liver. Insulin did not alter the phosphorylation of f1 histone in the perfused liver. The stimulation by insulin previously observed in the whole animal, therefore, was an indirect effect, probably due to glucagon or catecholamines released in response to insulin-induced hypoglycemia."

The pH optimum for activity was 6.5. The enzyme was specific for ATP, and a divalent cation was required for activity. At 1:1 cation/ATP ratios, relative activities were Mn2+ g Mg2+ g Ca2+. Free Mn2+ was inhibitory, whereas activation by free Ca2+ was observed. Complex kinetic behavior was observed when the concentration of one substrate was varied in the presence of a high level of the second substrate. Activation was observed with increasing concentrations of NAD+ and ATP. Substrate concentrations giving one-half maximum velocities were 0.83 mm ATP and 0.68 mm NAD+. No activation was seen with a variety of metabolites. NADPH, NADH, ADP, AMP, and cyclic 3',5'-AMP were inhibitors. The molecular weight estimated by gel filtration and density gradient centrifugation was 310,000. The relationship between the properties of the enzyme and the changes in pH, cation content, and substrate levels in eggs at fertilization were considered."

The mechanism of activation apparently involves malate binding at other than the catalytic site, with the induction of a 10-fold decrease in the Michaelis constant for DPN. This accounts for activation through increased prevailing velocity without altering the basic compulsory order mechanism or the maximum velocity."
https://openalex.org/W1514250768,"Abstract In the presence of NAD+ or NADH, microsomal pig brain NAD glycohydrolase is rapidly inactivated by dilute solutions of reduced dithiothreitol and other thiols. The rate of inactivation is increased by increased concentration of thiol, nicotinamide nucleotide, and increased values of pH. The inactive form of the enzyme is not reactivated by removal or destruction of the thiol. Inactivation of the enzyme is accompanied by an increase in the content of protein sulfhydryl groups as measured by reactivity toward 5,5'-dithiobis(2nitrobenzoic acid). These data together with analysis of the kinetics of the inactivation process suggest that inactivation is the consequence of the reduction of an essential protein disulfide group which is exposed to the aqueous environment following binding of a nicotinamide nucleotide coenzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1578815638,"Abstract Electron spin resonance (ESR) and absorption spectral studies are described which demonstrate two types of cyanide complex of Co(II) human carbonic anhydrase B. High spin (S = 3/2) Co(II) is present at the active site of the cobalt enzyme in the presence of both 1 and 2 eq of CN- at room temperature. At liquid nitrogen temperature the 1:1 complex remains high spin, while the enzyme in the presence of 2 eq of CN- shifts to low spin (S = 1/2). ESR spectra at 111°K and 10°K and absorption spectra at 299°K and 77°K are compatible with tetrahedral coordination geometry for the 1:1 complex at all temperatures and for the enzyme in the presence of 2 eq of CN- at room temperature. Determination of the temperature dependence of the ESR and absorption spectra of the enzyme in the presence of 2 eq of CN- shows a low spin dicyanide complex to form when the sample freezes (∼273°K). The ESR spectra at liquid nitrogen temperature of the dicyanide complex formed with 12C14N-, 12C15N-, and 13C14N- show it to contain two ligands along the z-axis of the complex, a nitrogen atom from the protein and the carbon atom of a C-coordinated cyanide. A coordination complex consisting of a distorted trigonal bipyramid with five ligands to the Co(II) or an octahedral complex with six ligands would account for the ESR and absorption spectra of the low spin dicyanide complex at liquid nitrogen temperature. These changes illustrate a certain flexibility of the ligands at the active site as well as a difference in molecular conformation between the liquid and the frozen state."
