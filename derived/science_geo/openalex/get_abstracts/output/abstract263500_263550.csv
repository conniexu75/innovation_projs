The human MHC class I system (HLA-I) is extremely polymorphic. The number of registered HLA-I molecules has now surpassed 1500. Characterizing the specificity of each separately would be a major undertaking.Here, we have drawn on a large database of known peptide-HLA-I interactions to develop a bioinformatics method, which takes both peptide and HLA sequence information into account, and generates quantitative predictions of the affinity of any peptide-HLA-I interaction. Prospective experimental validation of peptides predicted to bind to previously untested HLA-I molecules, cross-validation, and retrospective prediction of known HIV immune epitopes and endogenous presented peptides, all successfully validate this method. We further demonstrate that the method can be applied to perform a clustering analysis of MHC specificities and suggest using this clustering to select particularly informative novel MHC molecules for future biochemical and functional analysis.Encompassing all HLA molecules, this high-throughput computational method lends itself to epitope searches that are not only genome- and pathogen-wide, but also HLA-wide. Thus, it offers a truly global analysis of immune responses supporting rational development of vaccines and immunotherapy. It also promises to provide new basic insights into HLA structure-function relationships. The method is available at http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/NetMHCpan."
https://openalex.org/W2162096092,"In 1975, John Cairns proposed the 'immortal strand' hypothesis as a mechanism by which adult stem cells might minimize accumulation of mutations. This is achieved by selectively retaining chromosomes containing 'old' DNA as shown by the analysis of the DNA strands that incorporate radioactive label or a nucleotide analogue such as bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU). A new contribution to this ongoing debate is published in this issue. Kiel et al. show that the immortal strand model is not a general property of stem cells since it does not apply to haematopoietic stem cells. These cells cannot be identified on the basis of BrdU label retention, and do not retain older DNA during division. The 'immortal strand' hypothesis has been proposed as a mechanism by which adult stem cells minimize accumulation of mutations. This is achieved by selectively retain chromosomes containing 'old' DNA, as shown by the analysis of the DNA strands that incorporated radioactive label or a nucleotide analogue such as bromodeoxyuridine. A new important contribution to this ongoing debate shows that 'the immortal strand' model does not apply to haematopoietic stem cells and BrdU label retention should not be viewed as a fundamental characteristic of stem cells. Stem cells are proposed to segregate chromosomes asymmetrically during self-renewing divisions so that older (‘immortal’) DNA strands are retained in daughter stem cells whereas newly synthesized strands segregate to differentiating cells1,2,3,4,5,6. Stem cells are also proposed to retain DNA labels, such as 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine (BrdU), either because they segregate chromosomes asymmetrically or because they divide slowly5,7,8,9. However, the purity of stem cells among BrdU-label-retaining cells has not been documented in any tissue, and the ‘immortal strand hypothesis’ has not been tested in a system with definitive stem cell markers. Here we tested these hypotheses in haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), which can be highly purified using well characterized markers. We administered BrdU to newborn mice, mice treated with cyclophosphamide and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, and normal adult mice for 4 to 10 days, followed by 70 days without BrdU. In each case, less than 6% of HSCs retained BrdU and less than 0.5% of all BrdU-retaining haematopoietic cells were HSCs, revealing that BrdU has poor specificity and poor sensitivity as an HSC marker. Sequential administration of 5-chloro-2-deoxyuridine and 5-iodo-2-deoxyuridine indicated that all HSCs segregate their chromosomes randomly. Division of individual HSCs in culture revealed no asymmetric segregation of the label. Thus, HSCs cannot be identified on the basis of BrdU-label retention and do not retain older DNA strands during division, indicating that these are not general properties of stem cells."
https://openalex.org/W2126769883,"Background Resolving the phylogenetic relationships between eukaryotes is an ongoing challenge of evolutionary biology. In recent years, the accumulation of molecular data led to a new evolutionary understanding, in which all eukaryotic diversity has been classified into five or six supergroups. Yet, the composition of these large assemblages and their relationships remain controversial. Methodology/Principle Findings Here, we report the sequencing of expressed sequence tags (ESTs) for two species belonging to the supergroup Rhizaria and present the analysis of a unique dataset combining 29908 amino acid positions and an extensive taxa sampling made of 49 mainly unicellular species representative of all supergroups. Our results show a very robust relationship between Rhizaria and two main clades of the supergroup chromalveolates: stramenopiles and alveolates. We confirm the existence of consistent affinities between assemblages that were thought to belong to different supergroups of eukaryotes, thus not sharing a close evolutionary history. Conclusions This well supported phylogeny has important consequences for our understanding of the evolutionary history of eukaryotes. In particular, it questions a single red algal origin of the chlorophyll-c containing plastids among the chromalveolates. We propose the abbreviated name ‘SAR’ (Stramenopiles+Alveolates+Rhizaria) to accommodate this new super assemblage of eukaryotes, which comprises the largest diversity of unicellular eukaryotes."
https://openalex.org/W2085558309,"AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) plays a key role in maintaining energy homeostasis. Activation of AMPK in peripheral tissues has been shown to alleviate the symptoms of metabolic diseases, such as type 2 diabetes, and consequently AMPK is a target for treatment of these diseases. Recently, a small molecule activator (A-769662) of AMPK was identified that had beneficial effects on metabolism in ob/ob mice. Here we show that A-769662 activates AMPK both allosterically and by inhibiting dephosphorylation of AMPK on Thr-172, similar to the effects of AMP. A-769662 activates AMPK harboring a mutation in the gamma subunit that abolishes activation by AMP. An AMPK complex lacking the glycogen binding domain of the beta subunit abolishes the allosteric effect of A-769662 but not the allosteric activation by AMP. Moreover, mutation of serine 108 to alanine, an autophosphorylation site within the glycogen binding domain of the beta1 subunit, almost completely abolishes activation of AMPK by A-769662 in cells and in vitro, while only partially reducing activation by AMP. Based on our results we propose a model for activation of AMPK by A-769662. Importantly, this model may provide clues for understanding the mechanism by which AMP leads to activation of AMPK, which in turn may help in the identification of other AMPK activators."
https://openalex.org/W2086919865,"Although the multiplication of bacteriophages (phages) has a substantial impact on the biosphere, comparatively little is known about how the external environment affects phage production. Here we report that sub-lethal concentrations of certain antibiotics can substantially stimulate the host bacterial cell's production of some virulent phage. For example, a low dosage of cefotaxime, a cephalosporin, increased an uropathogenic Escherichia coli strain's production of the phage ΦMFP by more than 7-fold. We name this phenomenon Phage-Antibiotic Synergy (PAS). A related effect was observed in diverse host-phage systems, including the T4-like phages, with β-lactam and quinolone antibiotics, as well as mitomycin C. A common characteristic of these antibiotics is that they inhibit bacterial cell division and trigger the SOS system. We therefore examined the PAS effect within the context of the bacterial SOS and filamentation responses. We found that the PAS effect appears SOS-independent and is primarily a consequence of cellular filamentation; it is mimicked by cells that constitutively filament. The fact that completely unrelated phages manifest this phenomenon suggests that it confers an important and general advantage to the phages."
https://openalex.org/W2021618108,"Posttranslational protein modification with small ubiquitin-related modifier (SUMO) is an important regulatory mechanism implicated in many cellular processes, including several of biomedical relevance. We report that inhibition of the proteasome leads to accumulation of proteins that are simultaneously conjugated to both SUMO and ubiquitin in yeast and in human cells. A similar accumulation of such conjugates was detected in <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae ubc4 ubc5</i> cells as well as in mutants lacking two RING finger proteins, Ris1 and Hex3/Slx5-Slx8, that bind to SUMO as well as to the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme Ubc4. <i>In vitro</i>, Hex3-Slx8 complexes promote Ubc4-dependent ubiquitylation. Together these data identify a previously unrecognized pathway that mediates the proteolytic down-regulation of sumoylated proteins. Formation of substrate-linked SUMO chains promotes targeting of SUMO-modified substrates for ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis. Genetic and biochemical evidence indicates that SUMO conjugation can ultimately lead to inactivation of sumoylated substrates by polysumoylation and/or ubiquitin-dependent degradation. Simultaneous inhibition of both mechanisms leads to severe phenotypic defects."
https://openalex.org/W2097171062,"Myostatin is a transforming growth factor-ß family member that normally acts to limit skeletal muscle growth. Mice genetically engineered to lack myostatin activity have about twice the amount of muscle mass throughout the body, and similar effects are seen in cattle, sheep, dogs, and a human with naturally occurring loss-of-function mutations in the myostatin gene. Hence, there is considerable interest in developing agents capable of inhibiting myostatin activity for both agricultural and human therapeutic applications. We previously showed that the myostatin binding protein, follistatin, can induce dramatic increases in muscle mass when overexpressed as a transgene in mice. In order to determine whether this effect of follistatin results solely from inhibition of myostatin activity, I analyzed the effect of this transgene in myostatin-null mice. Mstn−/− mice carrying a follistatin transgene had about four times the muscle mass of wild type mice, demonstrating the existence of other regulators of muscle mass with similar activity to myostatin. The greatest effect on muscle mass was observed in offspring of mothers homozygous for the Mstn mutation, raising the possibility that either myostatin itself or a downstream regulator may normally be transferred from the maternal to fetal circulations. These findings demonstrate that the capacity for increasing muscle growth by manipulating TGF-ß signaling pathways is much more extensive than previously appreciated and suggest that muscle mass may be controlled at least in part by a systemic mode of action of myostatin."
https://openalex.org/W2138163279,"Dysfunction of prefrontal cortex in schizophrenia includes changes in GABAergic mRNAs, including decreased expression of GAD1, encoding the 67 kDa glutamate decarboxylase (GAD67) GABA synthesis enzyme. The underlying molecular mechanisms remain unclear. Alterations in DNA methylation as an epigenetic regulator of gene expression are thought to play a role but this hypothesis is difficult to test because no techniques are available to extract DNA from GAD1 expressing neurons efficiently from human postmortem brain. Here, we present an alternative approach that is based on immunoprecipitation of mononucleosomes with anti-methyl-histone antibodies differentiating between sites of potential gene expression as opposed to repressive or silenced chromatin. Methylation patterns of CpG dinucleotides at the GAD1 proximal promoter and intron 2 were determined for each of the two chromatin fractions separately, using a case-control design for 14 schizophrenia subjects affected by a decrease in prefrontal GAD1 mRNA levels. In controls, the methylation frequencies at CpG dinucleotides, while overall higher in repressive as compared to open chromatin, did not exceed 5% at the proximal GAD1 promoter and 30% within intron 2. Subjects with schizophrenia showed a significant, on average 8-fold deficit in repressive chromatin-associated DNA methylation at the promoter. These results suggest that chromatin remodeling mechanisms are involved in dysregulated GABAergic gene expression in schizophrenia."
https://openalex.org/W2025682709,"In expanding pea leaves, over 95% of fatty acids (FA) synthesized in the plastid are exported for assembly of eukaryotic glycerolipids. It is often assumed that the major products of plastid FA synthesis (18:1 and 16:0) are first incorporated into 16:0/18:1 and 18:1/18:1 molecular species of phosphatidic acid (PA), which are then converted to phosphatidylcholine (PC), the major eukaryotic phospholipid and site of acyl desaturation. However, by labeling lipids of pea leaves with [14C]acetate, [14C]glycerol, and [14C]carbon dioxide, we demonstrate that acyl editing is an integral component of eukaryotic glycerolipid synthesis. First, no precursor-product relationship between PA and PC [14C]acyl chains was observed at very early time points. Second, analysis of PC molecular species at these early time points showed that >90% of newly synthesized [14C]18:1 and [14C]16:0 acyl groups were incorporated into PC alongside a previously synthesized unlabeled acyl group (18:2, 18:3, or 16:0). And third, [14C]glycerol labeling produced PC molecular species highly enriched with 18:2, 18:3, and 16:0 FA, and not 18:1, the major product of plastid fatty acid synthesis. In conclusion, we propose that most newly synthesized acyl groups are not immediately utilized for PA synthesis, but instead are incorporated directly into PC through an acyl editing mechanism that operates at both sn-1 and sn-2 positions. Additionally, the acyl groups removed by acyl editing are largely used for the net synthesis of PC through glycerol 3-phosphate acylation.

Kim D.N. Stumpf P.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 1194-1198Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Essentially all acyl chains for membrane and storage lipid synthesis are produced in the plastid (2Ohlrogge J. Kim J. Plant Cell. 1995; 7: 957-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (1258) Google Scholar, 3Schwender J. Kim J.B. Plant Physiol. 2002; 130: 347-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). The initial products of FAS, 16- and 18-carbon fatty acids (FAs) esterified to ACP, are incorporated into glycerolipids by one of two routes: (i) acyl-ACP is used directly by acyltransferases of the “prokaryotic” pathway within the plastid, or (ii) the acyl-ACP thioester bond is hydrolyzed during acyl export from the plastid prior to FA reactivation and incorporation into glycerolipids by acyltransferases of the “eukaryotic” pathway outside the plastid. This two pathway mechanism for glycerolipid synthesis was first elucidated by radiotracer studies (4Roughan P.G. Kim C.R. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1982; 33: 97-132Crossref Google Scholar), and was confirmed genetically by analysis of Arabidopsis mutants (2Ohlrogge J. Kim J. Plant Cell. 1995; 7: 957-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (1258) Google Scholar, 5Somerville C. Kim J. Science. 1991; 252: 80-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). The proportions of nascent FA (i.e. immediate products of FAS) incorporated into the eukaryotic and prokaryotic pathways vary widely among plants and different tissues within the same plant. The eukaryotic pathway predominates in non-photosynthetic tissues of all higher plants. In 18:3 plants, 3Fatty acids are described by the convention “carbon number:number of double bonds.” For example, oleic acid is represented as 18:1. The molecular species of phospholipids are described by FA/FA. When known, the sn-1 position is represented first, but often the stereochemistry is uncertain. For example, both 1-oleoyl-2-linoleoyl-sn-phosphatidylcholine and 1-linoleoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-phosphatidylcholine are described as 18:1/18:2-PC. so called because they accumulate predominantly 18:3 and not 16:3 in their leaf galactolipids, 95% of the FA produced in the plastid is exported for assembly into glycerolipids by the eukaryotic pathway. Only phosphatidylglycerol (PG) is synthesized directly in the plastid from acyl-ACPs. This is in contrast to leaves of 16:3 plants which can also synthesize glycolipids by the prokaryotic pathway. Consequently, only about 60% of FA produced in the chloroplast by 16:3 plants is exported to the eukaryotic pathway (6Browse J. Kim N. Somerville C.R. Slack C.R. Biochem. J. 1986; 235: 25-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). 18:3 plants, which include pea, make up about 88% of angiosperm species (7Mongrand S. Kim J.J. Cabantous F. Cassagne C. Phytochemistry. 1998; 49: 1049-1064Crossref Scopus (131) Google Scholar). It is generally assumed that the major exported products of chloroplast FAS, namely 18:1 and 16:0 FA, are transferred to the outer envelope of the plastid where they are activated to acyl-CoAs by a long chain acyl-CoA synthetase (8Block M.A. Kim A.J. Joyard J. Douce R. FEBS Lett. 1983; 153: 377-381Crossref Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 9Andrews J. Kim K. Plant Physiol. 1983; 72: 735-740Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The eukaryotic pathway for de novo PC synthesis then utilizes this pool of newly synthesized acyl-CoAs for sequential sn-1 and sn-2 acylations of glycerol 3-phosphate to produce 18:1/18:1 and 16:0/18:1 molecular species of phosphatidic acid (PA). PA is rapidly converted to phosphatidylcholine (PC) by the action of PA phosphatase and CDP-choline:1,2-diacyl-sn-glycerol choline-phosphotransferase (2Ohlrogge J. Kim J. Plant Cell. 1995; 7: 957-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (1258) Google Scholar). Desaturation of 18:1 to 18:2 and then 18:3 on PC produces the abundant polyunsaturated molecular species of PC (10Sperling P. Kim E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 213: 965-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 11Harwood J.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta-Lipids Lipid Metab. 1996; 1301: 7-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). However, several lines of evidence suggest that this model may be inadequate and needs to take account of acyl editing. We define acyl editing, often also termed “remodeling” or “retailoring,” as any process that exchanges acyl groups between polar lipids but which does not by itself result in the net synthesis of the polar lipids. Acyl editing has long been considered an important facet of phospholipid metabolism (12Lands W.E.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1965; 34: 313-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Acyl editing relevant to this work can occur through two mechanisms. In plants acyl editing via a CoA:PC acyl exchange mechanism was demonstrated in microsomes isolated from developing seeds and was attributed to a reverse reaction of lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase (LPCAT) (13Stymne S. Kim A.K. Biochem. J. 1984; 223: 305-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). LPCAT activity has also been described in isolated chloroplasts (14Bertrams M. Kim K. Heinz E. Z. Naturforsch. (C). 1981; 36: 62-70Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 15Bessoule J.J. Kim E. Cassagne C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 228: 490-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 16Kjellberg J.M. Kim M. Andersson M. Sandelius A.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta Mol. Cell. Biol. Lipids. 2000; 1485: 100-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) as well as microsomes (17Stymne S. Kim A.K. Glad G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 752: 198-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 18Rochester C.P. Kim D.G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1984; 232: 249-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 19Demandre C. Kim J. Serghini H. Alpha M.J. Mazliak P. Phytochemistry. 1994; 35: 1171-1175Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 20Serghinicaid H. Kim C. Justin A.M. Mazliak P. Plant Sci. 1988; 54: 93-101Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Thus LPCAT allows for a mechanism for acyl editing, although the in vitro results do not indicate how prevalent the reaction might be in vivo. In this context, isolated pea chloroplasts incubated with [14C]acetate immediately label PC with newly synthesized FA through a channeled pool of acyl-CoA (21Koo A.J.K. Kim J.B. Pollard M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 16101-16110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). As chloroplasts cannot synthesize PC de novo, this indicated a functional mechanism for PC synthesis with nascent FA through an acyl editing mechanism. A second mechanism for acyl editing involves hydrolysis of the phospholipid, such as PC to lyso-PC or even to glycerolphosphorylcholine (GPC), activation of the released free fatty acid and its reutilization for phospholipid synthesis from lyso-PC or GPC. Based on 18O labeling there is some indication that acyl chains esterified to bulk cellular PC are under a constant flux of acyl editing that proceeds wholly or in part through a hydrolytic deacylation-reacylation cycle (22Pollard M. Kim J. Plant Physiol. 1999; 121: 1217-1226Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The most direct line of evidence of acyl editing in plants comes from a careful analysis of the molecular species of monogalactosyldiacylglycerol and PC after labeling leaf disks of the 16:3 plant Brassica napus with carbon dioxide (23Williams J.P. Kim V. Khan M.U. Hodson J.N. Biochem. J. 2000; 349: 127-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). [14C]Carbon dioxide labeling produced initial acyl-labeled species as expected for prokaryotic monogalactosyldiacylglycerol, namely dual labeled 16:0/18:1. By contrast for PC a high degree of scrambling between labeled and unlabeled acyl chains was noted. The authors concluded that there was continuous exchange of acyl groups between all molecular species of PC immediately after labeling and during the prolonged pulse-chase period of 48 h. In this report, we augment and extend these important observations and conclusions in several ways: 1) We perform rapid kinetic studies to more carefully address PC labeling and that of its precursors, PA and 1,2-diacyl-sn-glycerol (DAG). We address whether the initial incorporation of nascent fatty acids occurs via acyl editing, or if there is a rapid incorporation by de novo PC synthesis via glycerol-3-P (G3P) and DAG, which is followed by rapid acyl editing of PC. 2) We perform both total molecular species and stereochemical analyses on acyl-labeled PC using in vivo experiments with expanding pea leaves and seedlings. Pea is an 18:3 plant, so this complements the analysis done previously with the 16:3 plant B. napus (23Williams J.P. Kim V. Khan M.U. Hodson J.N. Biochem. J. 2000; 349: 127-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). 3) We track molecular species of PC labeled in the glycerol backbone. When combined with the analysis of acyl labeling, this allows us to propose that sn-1 acyl editing is as important a component as sn-2 acyl editing. 4) As a control, we perform rapid labeling experiments in planta using carbon dioxide. The results parallel those obtained with excised tissue assays, indicating that there are no wound responses that compromise the metabolic conclusions obtained from excised tissue experiments. From these studies we analyzed possible models by which newly synthesized FA are incorporated into eukaryotic lipids. The data presented in this report and from other studies do not allow us to unambiguously define one particular model, but do narrow down the possible routes in which nascent FA are incorporated into eukaryotic glycerolipids and suggest future directions to reexamine this important yet poorly understood area of plant lipid metabolism. Plant Materials—All experiments were performed with Garden pea (Pisum sativum L. cv Little marvel) grown in soil/perlite/vermiculite (1:1:1) mixture at 22–25 °C under a day/night 8/16-h photoperiod of white light at 185–210 μmol m–2 s–1. Leaves, or in some cases, whole seedlings were harvested 8 days after sowing. Radiochemicals—[1-14C]Acetic acid, sodium salt (specific activity 50 mCi/mmol), [U-14C]glycerol (specific activity 150 mCi/mmol), and [14C]sodium bicarbonate (specific activity 50 mCi/mmol) were from American Radiolabeled Chemicals, Inc. (St. Louis, MO). Leaf [14C]Acetate or [14C]Glycerol Labeling—Leaf-labeling experiments used ∼0.3 g fresh weight of pea leaf strips per assay, incubated in the light (180–220 μmol m–2 s–1) at 22–24 °C with reciprocal shaking in 5 ml of media containing 20 mm MES pH 5.5, 0.1× MS salts, and 0.01% Tween 20. Cut leaves were placed in media without radioisotope and preincubated in ambient light for 5 min. Labeling was started by the addition of radioactive substrate and strong illumination. The reaction was quenched by transfer of leaves into isopropyl alcohol at 80 °C for 10 min. For labeling of acyl groups 250 μCi of [1-14C]acetic acid (1.0 mm) was used per replicate. For [14C]glycerol labeling of PC molecular species each incubation contained 47 μm [U-14C]glycerol (39 μCi). For [14C]glycerol time course the labeling media contained 25 μm [U-14C]glycerol (18 μCi), and the media was reused for consecutive 1, 3, 6, and 9 min time points. In vivo labeling with excised plant tissue can produce considerable variance between samples due to differences in development and in uptake of substrate. To minimize such variance each data point for total incorporation into lipids was normalized against the trend line for all time points to allow improved kinetic plots (Figs. 1 and 3).FIGURE 3Time course for incorporation of label from [14C]glycerol into the backbone and acyl groups of glycerolipids by excised pea leaves.

[14C]CO2 was released by injection of 1 ml H2SO4 through the desiccator lid into a vial containing aqueous [14C]NaHCO3. The head space of the vial was quickly flushed with 30 ml of air, and the desiccator sealed for the desired time. Labeling was stopped by removal of the shoots at the base of the first leaves and quenching in 80 °C isopropyl alcohol. The assay used ∼700 μCi substrate and ∼40 seedlings. The seedlings from each labeling were split into two replicate samples (∼20 seedlings each) for analysis. Although each labeling was nominally for 5 min, about 5 min was required to remove all the seedlings and quench, so the assay is reported as of 5–10 min duration. General Methods—Lipids were extracted from hot isopropyl alcohol quenched tissue with hexane/isopropyl alcohol (24Hara A. Kim N.S. Anal. Biochem. 1978; 90: 420-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (2094) Google Scholar) after homogenization with a mortar and pestle. Chlorophyll was determined spectrophotometrically at 652 nm in 20% aqueous acetone (25Arnon D.I. Plant Physiol. 1949; 24: 1-15Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Radioactivity in the total lipid samples, eluted lipids or organic and aqueous phases recovered from transmethylation was quantified by liquid scintillation counting (Beckman Instrument Inc., Fullerton, CA), while radioactivity on TLC plates was visualized and quantified by electronic radiography (Packard Instrument Co., Meriden, CT). AgNO3-TLC plates were prepared by impregnating Partisil® K6 silica gel 60 Å TLC plates (Whatman, Maidstone, UK) with 10% AgNO3 in acetonitrile (w/v), drying in air and activating at 110 °C for 5 min. Fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) were quantified by gas chromatography (GC) using a flame ionization detection and a DB-23 capillary column (30 m length × 0.25 mm inner diameter, 0.25 μ film thickness; J&W). Lipid Class Analysis—For kinetic analyses polar lipids were separated on a K6 silica TLC plates impregnated with 0.15 m ammonium sulfate and heat-activated (110 °C for 3 h) prior to lipid loading. Plates were developed in acetone/toluene/water (91:30:8, v/v/v) (26Khan M.U. Kim J.P. J. Chromatogr. 1977; 140: 179-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). DAG was analyzed by first acetylating an aliquot of the total lipids in acetic anhydride/pyridine (3:2, v/v) and then separating the 1,2-diacyl-3-acetylglycerols by silica TLC developed in hexane/diethyl ether/acetic acid (50:50:1, v/v/v). PA was isolated by a first preparative silica TLC separation using a K6 plate developed in chloroform/methanol/water (65:25:4, v/v/v), and further purified on a second K6 plate developed in chloroform/acetone/methanol/acetic acid/water (10:4: 2:2:1, v/v/v/v/v). For preparative TLC all solvents contained 0.01% butylated hydroxyl-toluene antioxidant. Lipids were eluted from TLC silica with chloroform/methanol/water (5:5:1, v/v/v). Chloroform and 0.88% aq. KCl were added to give chloroform/methanol/water ratios of 2:1:1 (v/v/v), resulting in a phase separation. The aqueous phase was back extracted with chloroform and lipids were recovered from the combined chloroform phases. For [14C]glycerol- and [14C]carbon dioxide-labeled lipids the proportion of label in the acyl groups versus the backbone/head group was determined by transmethylation (27Ichihara K. Kim A. Yamamoto K. Nakayama T. Lipids. 1996; 31: 535-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar) and scintillation counting of the separated organic and aqueous phases. Aqueous phase radioactivity from PC was determined to be in the glycerol backbone by silica TLC developed in methanol, water, 28% NH4OH, 3 m NaCl (50:26.6:17.9: 3.4, v/v/v/v), as sample radioactivity co-migrated with glycerol and glycerol 3-phosphate standards, but not choline. Radiolabeled Acyl Group Composition—FAMEs were prepared from purified individual lipids or total lipids by base-catalyzed transmethylation (27Ichihara K. Kim A. Yamamoto K. Nakayama T. Lipids. 1996; 31: 535-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). Recovered FAMEs were separated based on the number of double bonds by AgNO3-TLC, the plates being developed to ¾ height with hexane/diethyl ether (1:1, v/v), then fully with hexane/diethyl ether (9:1, v/v). PC Molecular Species Determination—PC was separated from other lipids by silica TLC (K6 plates developed with chloroform/methanol/acetic acid (75:25:8, v/v/v)). DAG was produced from the purified PC by phospholipase C (B. cereus, Sigma) digestion (28Christie W.W. Lipid Analysis: Isolation, Separation, Identification, and Structural Analysis of Lipids. 2003; (The Oily Press an imprint of PJ Barnes & Associates, Bridgwater, England)Google Scholar). The DAG was acetylated as described above and the 1,2-diacyl-3-acetylglycerols separated into molecular species based on the number of double bonds by argentation-TLC (28Christie W.W. Lipid Analysis: Isolation, Separation, Identification, and Structural Analysis of Lipids. 2003; (The Oily Press an imprint of PJ Barnes & Associates, Bridgwater, England)Google Scholar), using a triple development (½ then ¾ development in chloroform/methanol (96:4, v/v), then fully in chloroform/methanol (99:1, v/v)). The proportion of radioactivity in each band was determined by electronic autoradiography, then each band was eluted, the recovered lipids transmethylated, and the [14C]FAME analyzed by AgNO3-TLC, as described above. To determine endogenous acyl groups from isolated PC molecular species, triheptadecanoin was added as an internal standard to each fraction during elution and prior to transmethylation and GC analysis of FAME. When necessary 1,2-diacyl-3-acetylglycerol fractions recovered from AgNO3 TLC plates were further purified by reverse phase TLC on Partisil® KC18 silica gel 60 Å plates (Whatman) developed with methanol/acetone/water (75:25:2, v/v/v). PC Acyl Group Stereochemistry—PC was isolated as described above and digested with phospholipase A2 (Crotalus atrox, Sigma) (28Christie W.W. Lipid Analysis: Isolation, Separation, Identification, and Structural Analysis of Lipids. 2003; (The Oily Press an imprint of PJ Barnes & Associates, Bridgwater, England)Google Scholar). Briefly, PC was dissolved in 1 ml of diethyl ether and 0.5 unit of PLA2 in 0.1 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.7, 5 mm CaCl2. The reaction was mixed vigorously for 5 min then the ether was evaporated under N2. To extract lipids 3.8 ml of chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v) and 1 ml of 0.15 m acetic acid were added, the mixture vortexed, the chloroform phase collected and the aqueous phase back extracted with 2.5 ml of chloroform. Reaction products were separated on silica TLC plates developed with chloroform/methanol/acetic acid/water (50:30: 8/4, v/v/v/v). Radioactivity in the free fatty acid and lyso-PC fractions was quantified by electronic autoradiography, then each product eluted and transmethylated by heating at 50 °C in 5% sulfuric acid in methanol for 30 min. Labeled and unlabeled FAME compositions were determined as described above. Lipid Molecular Species by Mass Spectrometry—Pea leaf samples were analyzed by ESI-MS/MS by the Kansas Lipidomics Research Center. Extraction of lipids was conducted by their standard Arabidopsis leaf protocol. The data set from this analysis is available in supplemental Fig. S1. Net Rate of Fatty Acid Deposition—The net rate of fatty acid synthesis by pea leaves was determined by harvesting 10 leaves from pea seedlings at the start and end of the light cycle for 3 days. After immediate weighing to determine fresh weight, FAME and chlorophyll contents were measured as described above. Triheptadecanoin was added during the lipid extraction as an internal standard, providing methyl heptadecanoate after transmethylation for FAME analysis by GC. Kinetics of Glycerolipid Labeling from [14C]Acetate—Relationships between precursor and product pools in metabolic pathways are revealed by kinetic labeling experiments. The linear accumulation of a product, once reached, coincides with steady state labeling of all precursor pools. In this context [14C]acetate is ideal for the study of acyl lipid metabolism as it is rapidly taken up by excised leaf tissue and utilized for FAS, while the lipids are labeled in their acyl groups, with minimal head group labeling (21Koo A.J.K. Kim J.B. Pollard M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 16101-16110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The kinetics of [14C]acetate labeling of glycerolipids from rapidly expanding excised pea leaves over a period of 9 min is shown in Fig. 1. PC was the major radiolabeled glycerolipid with over 65% of the label at all time points. Furthermore, steady state labeling was established very rapidly, with no detectable lag (Fig. 1A) and thus suggested that PC was a very early product of nascent FA incorporation into eukaryotic glycerolipids. A second independent 9-min time course gave similar results (data not shown). PE was labeled in a similar manner (Fig. 1C), with no obvious lag phase, but PC labeling was 15-fold greater than PE labeling despite endogenous PC levels only being twice that of PE (supplemental Fig. S1A). Both the PA and the DAG pools were still filling after the onset of PC steady state labeling. The label in PA reached a maximum by 3 min whereas DAG labeling increased throughout the time course (Fig. 1B). Thus, although PA and DAG are intermediates in the de novo synthesis of PC via acylation of glycerol-3-P, these [14C]acyl-labeled intermediates do not show a precursor-product relationship relative to PC labeling, and thus represent different glycerolipid pools. Of course, we cannot rule out that very small labeled PA and DAG pools might contribute to PC labeling in a precursor-product relationship, because experimentally, quenching in these kinetic assays limits the temporal resolution of the method. A statistical analysis suggested about 0.5 min of variance (95% CI) in rate extrapolations to zero time. In conclusion, we were not able to detect a [14C]acyl-labeled glycerolipid precursor pool to the labeling of PC. Acyl Compositions from [14C]Acetate Labeling of Lipids—Fig. 2 shows the composition of labeled fatty acids from the [14C]acetate time course, for total lipids, PC, PA, DAG, PG, and PE. Oleate was the major product in total lipids (Fig. 2A), with saturates, mainly palmitate, decreasing from 32% at 1 min to about 24% for the remainder of the assay period. The reason for this decline is unknown. There was no detectable desaturation of 18:1 at the earliest time point but desaturation to 18:2 was detectable from 3 min onwards. PC had less saturates (11% falling to 8%) whereas PE had more saturates (54% falling to 38%). By the end of the time course desaturation produced 7% linoleate in PC (Fig. 2B). In contrast to PC and PE, PA (Fig. 2C) contained high levels of saturates (>60%) throughout the time course and had an acyl composition with the closest match to PG. PA is also an intermediate of the prokaryotic glycerolipid synthesis pathway, and so the labeled PA pool is likely the precursor for prokaryotic PG labeling. In this context, close inspection of Fig. 1, B and C shows a kinetic precursor-product relationship between PA (label reaching a maximum at 3 min) and PG (lag phase ending at ∼3 min), confirming this conclusion. DAG contained an intermediate level of saturates compared with PC and PE. The origin of the labeled DAG is not certain. It is probably largely eukaryotic in origin, and may arise in part from the reverse action of CDP-choline:DAG cholinephosphotransferase or phospholipase C on labeled PC, or from acyl groups edited from PC re-entering the eukaryotic de novo glycerolipid synthesis pathway. Any of these explanations is supported by the appearance of labeled linoleate in DAG by 9 min (Fig. 2D). Whatever its origin, the difference in labeled acyl group composition of PA and DAG compared with PC supports the conclusion from the kinetic data that they do not represent precursors of initial PC acyl labeling. The Kinetics of Glycerolipid Labeling from [14C]Glycerol—[14C]Glycerol is rapidly taken up by pea leaves and incorporated into the glycerol backbone of glycerolipids. In addition, acyl groups also become labeled because glycerol 3-phosphate equilibrates with glycolytic precursors, leading to plastid acetyl-CoA production (29Slack C.R. Kim P.G. Balasingham N. Biochem. J. 1977; 162: 289-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). To separately analyze the label from the backbone/head-group and the acyl chains, isolated lipid classes were transmethylated. Analysis of the aqueous fraction from PC by TLC indicated that the radioactivity was contained in the glycerol backbone and not the choline headgroup, as noted before (29Slack C.R. Kim P.G. Balasingham N. Biochem. J. 1977; 162: 289-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In marked contrast to acetate labeling, [14C]glycerol incorporation into lipids exhibited a lag (Fig. 3A). At the earliest time points, radioactivity in DAG was approximately equal to PC. We assume that the labeled PA includes a large contribution from the plastid component. However, chloroplast lipid assembly in 18:3-plants does not require PA conversion to DAG, so we also assume the labeled DAG is largely associated with extraplastidial membranes. Two lines of argument support the notion that the biosynthesis of PC from labeled acetate (Fig. 1) and from labeled glycerol (Fig. 3) report different metabolic processes. First, for de novo PC synthesis the relative movement of label from PA to DAG to PC should be same for both glycerol and acyl group labeling strategies. However, at the earliest time points, it is clear that acetate acyl chain labeling produces PC ≫ DAG (Fig. 1A) whereas glycerol backbone labeling produces DAG ≈ PC (Fig. 3A), suggesting separate metabolic processes.

https://openalex.org/W2116455233,"The Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) is a class I transmembrane receptor expressed on the surface of immune system cells. TLR4 is activated by exposure to lipopolysaccharides derived from the outer membrane of Gram negative bacteria and forms part of the innate immune response in mammals. Like other class 1 receptors, TLR4 is activated by ligand induced dimerization, and recent studies suggest that this causes concerted conformational changes in the receptor leading to self association of the cytoplasmic Toll/Interleukin 1 receptor (TIR) signalling domain. This homodimerization event is proposed to provide a new scaffold that is able to bind downstream signalling adaptor proteins. TLR4 uses two different sets of adaptors; TRAM and TRIF, and Mal and MyD88. These adaptor pairs couple two distinct signalling pathways leading to the activation of interferon response factor 3 (IRF-3) and nuclear factor κB (NFκB) respectively. In this paper we have generated a structural model of the TLR4 TIR dimer and used molecular docking to probe for potential sites of interaction between the receptor homodimer and the adaptor molecules. Remarkably, both the Mal and TRAM adaptors are strongly predicted to bind at two symmetry-related sites at the homodimer interface. This model of TLR4 activation is supported by extensive functional studies involving site directed mutagenesis, inhibition by cell permeable peptides and stable protein phosphorylation of receptor and adaptor TIR domains. Our results also suggest a molecular mechanism for two recent findings, the caspase 1 dependence of Mal signalling and the protective effects conferred by the Mal polymorphism Ser180Leu."
https://openalex.org/W2121782223,"Variation in gene content among strains of a bacterial species contributes to biomedically relevant differences in phenotypes such as virulence and antimicrobial resistance. Group A Streptococcus (GAS) causes a diverse array of human infections and sequelae, and exhibits a complex pathogenic behavior. To enhance our understanding of genotype-phenotype relationships in this important pathogen, we determined the complete genome sequences of four GAS strains expressing M protein serotypes (M2, M4, and 2 M12) that commonly cause noninvasive and invasive infections. These sequences were compared with eight previously determined GAS genomes and regions of variably present gene content were assessed. Consistent with the previously determined genomes, each of the new genomes is ∼1.9 Mb in size, with ∼10% of the gene content of each encoded on variably present exogenous genetic elements. Like the other GAS genomes, these four genomes are polylysogenic and prophage encode the majority of the variably present gene content of each. In contrast to most of the previously determined genomes, multiple exogenous integrated conjugative elements (ICEs) with characteristics of conjugative transposons and plasmids are present in these new genomes. Cumulatively, 242 new GAS metagenome genes were identified that were not present in the previously sequenced genomes. Importantly, ICEs accounted for 41% of the new GAS metagenome gene content identified in these four genomes. Two large ICEs, designated 2096-RD.2 (63 kb) and 10750-RD.2 (49 kb), have multiple genes encoding resistance to antimicrobial agents, including tetracycline and erythromycin, respectively. Also resident on these ICEs are three genes encoding inferred extracellular proteins of unknown function, including a predicted cell surface protein that is only present in the genome of the serotype M12 strain cultured from a patient with acute poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis. The data provide new information about the GAS metagenome and will assist studies of pathogenesis, antimicrobial resistance, and population genomics."
https://openalex.org/W2004763337,"Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) is characterized by increased muscle damage and an abnormal blood flow after muscle contraction: the state of functional ischemia. Until now, however, the cause-effect relationship between the pathogenesis of DMD and functional ischemia was unclear. We examined (i) whether functional ischemia is necessary to cause contraction-induced myofiber damage and (ii) whether functional ischemia alone is sufficient to induce the damage.In vivo microscopy was used to document assays developed to measure intramuscular red blood cell flux, to quantify the amount of vasodilatory molecules produced from myofibers, and to determine the extent of myofiber damage. Reversal of functional ischemia via pharmacological manipulation prevented contraction-induced myofiber damage in mdx mice, the murine equivalent of DMD. This result indicates that functional ischemia is required for, and thus an essential cause of, muscle damage in mdx mice. Next, to determine whether functional ischemia alone is enough to explain the disease, the extent of ischemia and the amount of myofiber damage were compared both in control and mdx mice. In control mice, functional ischemia alone was found insufficient to cause a similar degree of myofiber damage observed in mdx mice. Additional mechanisms are likely contributing to cause more severe myofiber damage in mdx mice, suggestive of the existence of a ""two-hit"" mechanism in the pathogenesis of this disease.Evidence was provided supporting the essential role of functional ischemia in contraction-induced myofiber damage in mdx mice. Furthermore, the first quantitative evidence for the ""two-hit"" mechanism in this disease was documented. Significantly, the vasoactive drug tadalafil, a phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitor, administered to mdx mice ameliorated muscle damage."
https://openalex.org/W2001589227,"Central to the story of vertebrate evolution is the origin of the vertebrate head, a problem difficult to approach using paleontology and comparative morphology due to a lack of unambiguous intermediate forms. Embryologically, much of the vertebrate head is derived from two ectodermal tissues, the neural crest and cranial placodes. Recent work in protochordates suggests the first chordates possessed migratory neural tube cells with some features of neural crest cells. However, it is unclear how and when these cells acquired the ability to form cellular cartilage, a cell type unique to vertebrates. It has been variously proposed that the neural crest acquired chondrogenic ability by recruiting proto-chondrogenic gene programs deployed in the neural tube, pharynx, and notochord. To test these hypotheses we examined the expression of 11 amphioxus orthologs of genes involved in neural crest chondrogenesis. Consistent with cellular cartilage as a vertebrate novelty, we find that no single amphioxus tissue co-expresses all or most of these genes. However, most are variously co-expressed in mesodermal derivatives. Our results suggest that neural crest-derived cartilage evolved by serial cooption of genes which functioned primitively in mesoderm."
https://openalex.org/W2069657766,"Interneurons originating from the ganglionic eminence migrate tangentially into the developing cerebral wall as they navigate to their distinct positions in the cerebral cortex. Compromised connectivity and differentiation of interneurons are thought to be an underlying cause in the emergence of neurodevelopmental disorders such as schizophrenia. Previously, it was suggested that tangential migration of interneurons occurs in a radial glia independent manner. Here, using simultaneous imaging of genetically defined populations of interneurons and radial glia, we demonstrate that dynamic interactions with radial glia can potentially influence the trajectory of interneuronal migration and thus the positioning of interneurons in cerebral cortex. Furthermore, there is extensive local interneuronal migration in tangential direction opposite to that of pallial orientation (i.e., in a medial to lateral direction from cortex to ganglionic eminence) all across the cerebral wall. This counter migration of interneurons may be essential to locally position interneurons once they invade the developing cerebral wall from the ganglionic eminence. Together, these observations suggest that interactions with radial glial scaffold and localized migration within the expanding cerebral wall may play essential roles in the guidance and placement of interneurons in the developing cerebral cortex."
https://openalex.org/W1996405911,"The EGFR T790M mutation confers acquired resistance to kinase inhibitors in human EGFR mutant lung adenocarcinoma, is occasionally detected before treatment, and may confer genetic susceptibility to lung cancer.To study further its role in lung tumorigenesis, we developed mice with inducible expression in type II pneumocytes of EGFR(T790M) alone or together with a drug-sensitive L858R mutation. Both transgenic lines develop lung adenocarcinomas that require mutant EGFR for tumor maintenance but are resistant to an EGFR kinase inhibitor. EGFR(L858R+T790M)-driven tumors are transiently targeted by hsp90 inhibition. Notably, EGFR(T790M)-expressing animals develop tumors with longer latency than EGFR(L858R+T790M)-bearing mice and in the absence of additional kinase domain mutations.These new mouse models of mutant EGFR-dependent lung adenocarcinomas provide insight into clinical observations. The models should also be useful for developing improved therapies for patients with lung cancers harboring EGFR(T790M) alone or in conjunction with drug-sensitive EGFR kinase domain mutations."
https://openalex.org/W2056855407,"Regulated ectodomain shedding followed by intramembrane proteolysis has recently been recognized as important in cell signaling and for degradation of several type I transmembrane proteins. The receptor-tyrosine kinase Tie1 is known to undergo ectodomain cleavage generating a membrane-tethered endodomain. Here we show Tie1 is a substrate for regulated intramembrane proteolysis. After Tie1 ectodomain cleavage the newly formed 45-kDa endodomain undergoes additional proteolytic processing mediated by gamma-secretase to generate an amino-terminal-truncated 42-kDa fragment that is subsequently degraded by proteasomal activity. This sequential processing occurs constitutively and is stimulated by phorbol ester and vascular endothelial growth factor. To assess the biological significance of regulated Tie1 processing, we analyzed its effects on angiopoietin signaling. Activation of ectodomain cleavage causes loss of phosphorylated Tie1 holoreceptor and generation of phosphorylated receptor fragments in the presence of cartilage oligomeric protein angiopoietin 1. A key function of gamma-secretase is in preventing accumulation of these phosphorylated fragments. We also find that regulated Tie1 processing modulates ligand responsiveness of the Tie-1-associated receptor Tie2. Activation of Tie1 ectodomain cleavage increases cartilage oligomeric protein angiopoietin 1 activation of Tie2. This correlates with increased ability of Tie2 to bind ligand after shedding of the Tie1 extracellular domain. A similar enhancement of ligand activation of Tie2 is seen when Tie1 expression is suppressed by RNA interference. Together these data indicate that Tie1, via its extracellular domain, limits the ability of ligand to bind and activate Tie2. Furthermore the data suggest that regulated processing of Tie1 may be an important mechanism for controlling signaling by Tie2."
https://openalex.org/W2070766958,"The anti-malarial artesunate also exerts profound anti-cancer activity. The susceptibility of tumor cells to artesunate can be enhanced by ferrous iron. The transferrin receptor (TfR) is involved in iron uptake by internalization of transferrin and is over-expressed in rapidly growing tumors. The ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters ABCB6 and ABCB7 are also involved in iron homeostasis. To investigate whether these proteins play a role for sensitivity towards artesunate, Oncotest's 36 cell line panel was treated with artesunate or artesunate plus iron(II) glycine sulfate (Ferrosanol). The majority of cell lines showed increased inhibition rates, for the combination of artesunate plus iron(II) glycine sulfate compared to artesunate alone. However, in 11 out of the 36 cell lines the combination treatment was not superior. Cell lines with high TfR expression significantly correlated with high degrees of modulation indicating that high TfR expressing tumor cells would be more efficiently inhibited by this combination treatment than low TfR expressing ones. Furthermore, we found a significant relationship between cellular response to artesunate and TfR expression in 55 cell lines of the National Cancer Institute (NCI), USA. A significant correlation was also found for ABCB6, but not for ABCB7 in the NCI panel. Artesunate treatment of human CCRF-CEM leukemia and MCF7 breast cancer cells induced ABCB6 expression but repressed ABCB7 expression. Finally, artesunate inhibited proliferation and differentiation of mouse erythroleukemia (MEL) cells. Down-regulation of ABCB6 by antisense oligonucleotides inhibited differentiation of MEL cells indicating that artesunate and ABCB6 may cooperate. In conclusion, our results indicate that ferrous iron improves the activity of artesunate in some but not all tumor cell lines. Several factors involved in iron homeostasis such as TfR and ABCB6 may contribute to this effect."
https://openalex.org/W2034353384,"One of the goals in the treatment for diabetes is to enhance pancreatic beta cell function, proliferation, and survival. This study explores the role of lactogenic hormones, prolactin (PRL) and placental lactogen (PL), in beta cell survival. We have previously shown that transgenic mice expressing mouse placental lactogen-1 (mPL1) in beta cells under the rat insulin II promoter (RIP) are resistant to the diabetogenic and cytotoxic effects of streptozotocin (STZ) in vivo. The current study demonstrates that lactogens protect rat insulinoma (INS-1) cells and primary mouse beta cells against two distinct beta cell death inducers, STZ and dexamethasone (DEX), in vitro. Further, we identify the mechanism through which lactogens protect beta cells against DEX-induced death. The signaling pathway mediating this protective effect is the janus-activated-kinase-2/signal transducer and activator of transcription-5 (JAK2/STAT5) pathway. This is demonstrated in INS-1 cells and primary mouse beta cells using three separate approaches, pharmacological inhibitors, JAK2-specific siRNAs and a dominant-negative STAT5 mutant. Furthermore, lactogens specifically and significantly increase the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-XL in insulinoma cells and mouse islets. Bcl-XL-specific siRNA significantly inhibits lactogen-mediated protection against DEX-induced beta cell death.

Genetic, structural, binding, and functional studies attest to their common origin, with the PL (PL I and II) and PRL genes having evolved by a duplication event from a common ancestral gene in rodents. The major site of synthesis of PRL is the lactotroph cell of the anterior pituitary, although it is also expressed in several extrapituitary tissues. PL is synthesized in the giant trophoblast cell of the placenta during pregnancy. PRL and PL not only have related functions, but also bind and signal through a common receptor, the prolactin receptor (PRL-R), which belongs to the class I cytokine receptor family (1Talamantes F.

These mice are hypoglycemic, hyperinsulinemic, and display islet hyperplasia as a result of increased beta cell proliferation and hypertrophy.Lactogens acting through the PRL-R have been repeatedly shown to improve survival in a number of different cell types against diverse cell death-inducing agents (13Buckley A.R.

In this context, we have recently demonstrated that PL expression in the beta cell of RIP-mPL1 mice confers resistance in vivo to the diabetogenic and cytotoxic effects of a beta cell toxin, STZ, implying a protective role of mPL1 in beta cells (11Vasavada R.C. Garcia-Ocana A. Zawalich W.S. Sorenson R.L. Dann P. Syed M. Ogren L. Talamantes F. Stewart A.F. J. Biol.

Diabetes. 2004; 53: 3120-3130Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). However, the signaling pathways and molecular mechanisms by which lactogens improve beta cell survival are not known.In the current report we demonstrate a direct protective effect of lactogens on rodent pancreatic beta cells, both primary and insulinoma cells, against at least two distinct inducers of cell death, STZ and DEX. STZ in large doses can cause both beta cell necrosis and apoptosis, through DNA damage, activation of poly-ADP-ribose polymerase, and NAD+ depletion (19Masutani M. Suzuki H. Kamada N. Watanabe M. Ueda O. Nozaki T. Jishage K. Watanabe T. Sugimoto T. Nakagama H. Ochiya T. Sugimura T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2301-2304Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar), whereas DEX mainly induces apoptosis through the mitochondrial pathway (20Druilhe A. Letuve S. Pretolani M. Apoptosis. 2003; 8: 481-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). We show that both STZ and DEX induce activation of the executioner caspase-3, in INS-1 cells, and that lactogens can significantly reduce caspase-3 activation. These studies demonstrate for the first time that the JAK2/STAT5 pathway is critical for lactogen-mediated protection against DEX-induced cell death in insulinoma cells and in primary beta cells. To elucidate the mechanism by which lactogens protect beta cells, we examined the effect of lactogens on the expression of members of the Bcl family of proteins. A significant and specific increase in the level of the anti-apoptotic member Bcl-XL was observed in both primary beta cells and insulinoma cells treated with lactogens. Importantly, preventing PRL-induced expression of Bcl-XL by Bcl-XL-specific siRNA significantly inhibited the protective effect of lactogens against DEX-induced beta cell death, a first direct demonstration of the importance of Bcl-XL up-regulation in mediating the protective effect of lactogens in any cell type.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESGeneration of Transgenic Mice—The generation of RIP-mPL1 transgenic mice has been previously described in detail (11Vasavada R.C. Garcia-Ocana A. Zawalich W.S. Sorenson R.L. Dann P. Syed M. Ogren L. Talamantes F. Stewart A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15399-15406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). 3–6-month-old male and female mice were used from the transgenic line with the highest transgene expression, L60 (11Vasavada R.C. Garcia-Ocana A. Zawalich W.S. Sorenson R.L. Dann P. Syed M. Ogren L. Talamantes F. Stewart A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15399-15406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). This line was bred onto a CD-1 background for more than eight generations for these studies. Genotyping was performed by tail DNA PCR using primers for human growth hormone, and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, which serves as a control (12Fujinaka Y. Sipula D. Garcia-Ocaña A. Vasavada R.C. Diabetes. 2004; 53: 3120-3130Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). All studies were performed with the approval of, and in accordance with, guidelines established by the University of Pittsburgh Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.Mouse Primary Islet Cell and Rat Insulinoma (INS-1) Cell Cultures—Islets were isolated from normal and transgenic mice as described previously (12Fujinaka Y. Sipula D. Garcia-Ocaña A. Vasavada R.C. Diabetes. 2004; 53: 3120-3130Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Briefly, 3 ml of 1.7 mg/ml Collagenase P (Roche Applied Sciences) in Hanks' buffered saline solution (HBSS) is injected into the pancreatic duct. Subsequently, pancreata are removed and digested at 37 °C for 17 min, before sieving through a 500-μm wire mesh to separate undigested tissue. The digested pancreas is pelleted and rinsed with HBSS, and islets separated by density gradient in Histopaque (Sigma). After several washes, islets are handpicked under a microscope grid and cultured overnight in RPMI medium containing 5 mm d-glucose supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (complete medium) (21Cebrian A. Garcia-Ocaña A. Takane K.K. Sipula D. Stewart A.F. Vasavada R.C. Diabetes. 2002; 51: 3003-3013Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). For cell culture, islets are rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), trypsinized for 8–10 min at 37 °C, and islet cell cultures plated on 12-mm glass coverslips placed in 24-well plates. Cells from 50–70 islet equivalents (IE) (1 IE = 125 μm-diameter islet) were plated on each coverslip in 50 μl of complete medium, and incubated at 37 °C for 2 h, to allow cells to attach to the glass surface, after which another 1 ml of complete medium was added for an additional 24 h. Thereafter, cells were incubated overnight in fresh RPMI containing 5 mm d-glucose, 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA), without FBS, as the latter contains large amounts of lactogens (22Biswas R. Vonderhaar B.K. Cancer Res. 1987; 47: 3509-3514PubMed Google Scholar). Islet cell cultures were treated either with 1.5 mm STZ (Sigma) made in 10 mm sodium citrate pH 4, or vehicle as control, for 14 h. For DEX treatment, cells were cultured in medium containing 1% horse serum with addition of 500 nm DEX (Sigma) made in ethanol, or vehicle as control, every 24 h for 2 days. Cells were rinsed with PBS and subsequently fixed in freshly prepared 2% paraformaldehyde for 30 min at room temperature.Rat insulinoma cells (INS-1) kindly provided by Dr. Doris Stoffers (University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine) were grown in RPMI 1640 medium containing 11 mm d-glucose supplemented with 10% FBS, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 10 mm HEPES, 2 mm l-glutamine, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, and 50 μm β-mercaptoethanol (INS-1 medium). Prior to any treatment, the cells were precultured in serum-free medium (SFM) containing 1% BSA for 16–18 h, before addition of 200 ng/ml of ovine PRL (Sigma) made in PBS with 0.1% BSA, or PBS with 0.1% BSA alone as control. Eight hours after the addition of PRL, cells were treated as specified in the individual experiments.INS-1 Cell Viability Measured by the MTT Assay—Cell viability was assessed using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) (Sigma) assay in INS-1 cells (4 × 104) split in 96-well plates. After preculture, cells were treated with the individual cell death inducers as follows, 0.5 and 1.0 mm STZ for 14 h, or 10 and 100 nm DEX for 24 h, and subsequently analyzed. For the signaling pathway inhibitor experiments, cells were treated with inhibitors 60 min prior to preculturing with PRL. After 8 h of PRL treatment cell death was induced by 100 nm DEX for 18 h. MTT assay was performed by incubating the cells with 0.5 mg/ml MTT for 2 h at 37 °Cin 5% CO2. Formazan produced in the cells was dissolved with isopropyl alcohol, and absorbance was read at 570 and 690 nm.siRNA Treatment—INS-1 cells (8 × 104) grown on glass coverslips in a 24-well plate, were transfected 2 days later with 50 nm of scrambled, JAK2 or Bcl-XL siRNA (Dharmacon, Chicago, IL). The siRNA oligonucleotides were diluted in SFM with HEPES buffer containing Lipofectamine (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), incubated at room temperature for 30 min, then added to the cells and kept for 6 h at 37°C, after which transfection medium was removed and fresh culture medium was added. Twenty-four hours after transfection the cells were precultured in SFM containing 1% BSA with/without 200 ng/ml of PRL for 8 h, subsequently treated with 100 nm DEX for 18 h, and either fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde for 30 min at room temperature for cleaved caspase-3 staining or analyzed for cell viability by the MTT assay or for proteins by Western blot analysis.Adenovirus (Ad) Transduction—cDNA of a carboxyl-truncated STAT5a variant, Stat5aΔ740, which displays a dominant-negative (DN) effect on both Stat5a and Stat5b-mediated transcription was used to block PRL-induced STAT5 signaling (23Yamashita H. Iwase H. Toyama T. Fujii Y. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 1638-1652Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Adenovirus containing the DN-STAT5 or green fluorescent protein (GFP) cDNA were prepared and their concentration determined by optical density at 260 nm and by plaque assay. Primary mouse islet cell cultures were transduced with the adenoviral constructs at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 100 pfu/cell as previously described (24Vasavada, R. C., Wang, L., Fujinaka, Y., Takane, K. K., Rosa, T. C., Mellado-Gil, J. M., Friedman, P. A., and Garcia-Ocana, A. (2007) Diabetes, in pressGoogle Scholar).Analysis of Cell Death by Immunostaining—As STZ induces necrosis and apoptosis, STZ-induced beta cell death was analyzed in primary mouse islet cells by immunofluorescence co-staining for insulin, using an anti-insulin antibody (Zymed Laboratories Inc., South San Francisco, CA) at 1:50 dilution, and propidium iodide (PI, Sigma) to stain the nuclei (21Cebrian A. Garcia-Ocaña A. Takane K.K. Sipula D. Stewart A.F. Vasavada R.C. Diabetes. 2002; 51: 3003-3013Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), and the percentage of condensed, pyknotic insulin-positive nuclei were quantitated. 150 ± 17 insulin-positive cells were counted per coverslip in a total of 10 coverslips each, for normal and transgenic mice. DEX-induced beta cell death was quantitated by co-staining with insulin and terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase (TdT)-mediated dUTP nick end-labeling (TUNEL, Roche Applied Sciences), as recommended by the manufacturer, with simultaneous nuclear staining using Hoechst33258. The percentage of TUNEL and insulin-positive cells was quantitated in 8–14 samples each, counting an average of 600 ± 87 insulin-positive cells per sample for Fig. 2, and in 4 samples each counting an average of 1769 ± 59 insulin-positive cells per sample for Fig. 6. DEX-induced INS-1 cell death was measured by cleaved caspase-3 staining. INS-1 cells (4 × 104) were split on glass coverslips in a 24-well plate, precultured as described above, and treated with 100 nm DEX for 18–24 h before fixing with 2% paraformaldehyde for 30 min at room temperature. For the signaling experiments cells were treated with the different inhibitors 60 min prior to PRL treatment. For staining, cells were incubated in rabbit cleaved caspase-3 antibody diluted in PBS containing 1% BSA, 1% normal goat serum, 0.3% Triton X-100, and 0.02% sodium azide overnight at 4 °C. After incubation in fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibody, nuclei were stained with 20 μg/ml Hoechst 33258.FIGURE 6Lactogens mediate their protective effect on primary mouse beta cells through the JAK2/STAT5 signaling pathway. A, Western blot of mouse islets treated for different times with 200 ng/ml of PRL showing expression of phospho-STAT5, total STAT5, and tubulin. B, quantitation of the ratio of phospho-STAT5/total STAT5 (n = 2) shows a large increase in STAT5 activation 10 and 30 min after PRL treatment. C, quantitation of the percentage of DEX-induced TUNEL-positive beta cells in normal (NL) or lactogen-treated (TG/PRL, transgenic or PRL-treated NL) islet cells transduced with either the control Ad-GFP construct or the Ad-DN-STAT5 construct (Ad-DN, n = 4 each). There is equivalent beta cell death in the NL-GFP and the NL-DN groups. The percentage of beta cell death was significantly (p = 0.03) reduced in the TG/PRL-GFP group compared with the NL-GFP group. However, the protective effect of lactogens was completely lost in the presence of Ad-DN-STAT5, as seen by the increase in beta cell death in the TG/PRL-DN group, which was now equivalent to the cell death in the NL-DN group, and significantly increased (p = 0.01) compared with the TG/PRL-GFP group.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Western Blot Analysis—To analyze the signaling pathways activated by lactogens in islets, CD-1 mouse islets (200 IE/well) were cultured 24 h in filter inserts in complete medium after isolation. They were subsequently incubated in SFM overnight, treated with 200 ng/ml of PRL for varying times, washed with cold PBS containing 100 μm sodium orthovanadate and frozen. To examine the expression of Bcl proteins, islets from normal and RIP-mPL1 transgenic mice were either harvested immediately after isolation (Day 0) or cultured in medium containing 10% horse serum (which has lower lactogen levels than FBS) in filter inserts for 1 day after isolation (Day 1). INS-1 cells were treated as indicated in the individual experiments.Total INS-1 cell or whole islet extracts (20–30 μg) prepared using lysis buffer (21Cebrian A. Garcia-Ocaña A. Takane K.K. Sipula D. Stewart A.F. Vasavada R.C. Diabetes. 2002; 51: 3003-3013Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) were blotted on polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, incubated with each primary antibody overnight at 4 °C and then with the corresponding peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies, after which chemiluminescence was detected using the ECL system (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ). The different primary antibodies used were Bax (1:5000), Bcl-2 (1:1000) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), Bcl-XL (1:2000) (BD Pharmingen, San Diego, CA), cleaved caspase-3 and caspase-3, ERK1/2 and phospho-ERK1/2, Akt and Ser473 or Thr308 phosphospecific Akt, STAT5 and phospho-STAT5 (1:1000) (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA), actin (1:2000) (Sigma), and α-tubulin (1:1000) (EMD Biosciences/Calbiochem, San Diego, CA). Membranes were stripped in 15.6 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.0) buffer containing 2% SDS, 100 mm 2-mercaptoethanol for 30 min at 50 °C before reprobing with other antibodies. Quantitative densitometry of digitalized blots was performed using the Image J program (NIH) and analyzed statistically.Statistical Analysis—The data are expressed as the mean ± S.E. Results were analyzed by using Student's t test or one-way repeated measures analysis of variance (n.s., no significance; *, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01; ***, p < 0.005).RESULTSLactogens Protect Mouse Primary Beta Cells and INS-1 Cells against STZ-induced Cell Death in Vitro—We have previously shown that overexpression of PL in RIP-mPL1 transgenic mice protects beta cells from the diabetogenic and cytotoxic effects of STZ in vivo (11Vasavada R.C. Garcia-Ocana A. Zawalich W.S. Sorenson R.L. Dann P. Syed M. Ogren L. Talamantes F. Stewart A.F. J. Biol.

Diabetes. 2004; 53: 3120-3130Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). To directly demonstrate the pro-survival effect of lactogens and to identify the mechanisms involved in lactogen-mediated beta cell survival, we established an in vitro cell system. For this purpose, primary cell cultures prepared from islets isolated from normal and transgenic mice were subjected to STZ treatment and beta cell death was quantitated by co-staining with insulin and PI (Fig. 1A). The numbers of condensed pyknotic beta cell nuclei, an indicator of cell death, were significantly (2-fold) lower in transgenic versus normal islet cells (Fig. 1, A and B) indicating a protective effect of lactogens in vitro. We further examined the effect of lactogens on STZ-induced cell death in a rat insulinoma cell line, INS-1, acutely treated with or without PRL. There was a significant ∼35% decrease in INS-1 cell death in PRL-treated cells compared with controls as measured by the MTT assay (Fig. 1C). STZ also induced activation of cleaved caspase-3, a marker for cell death, in INS-1 cells. Again, PRL-treatment reduced levels of active caspase-3, and the reduction was significant at 0.5 mm STZ (Fig. 1, D and E). Thus, these results indicate that lactogens can indeed protect beta cells from STZ-mediated cell death in vitro, and that INS-1 cells may serve as a useful model system for studying intracellular signaling pathways and molecular mechanisms mediating the pro-survival effect of lactogens in beta cells.FIGURE 1Lactogens protect mouse primary beta cells and INS-1 cells against STZ-induced cell death in vitro. A, primary islet cell cultures from normal (NL) and RIP-mPL1 transgenic (TG) mice treated with 1.5 mm STZ for 14 h were stained for insulin (green) and propidium iodide (red). Arrows indicate condensed pyknotic nuclei. B, quantitation of the percentage of insulin-positive condensed nuclei indicating beta cell death from 10 samples each of NL and TG islet cultures, counting an average of 150 ± 17 beta cells/sample, indicates a significant 2-fold reduction in beta cell death in TG versus NL cells. C, INS-1 cell viability measured by the MTT assay after treatment with 1 mm STZ for 14 h in the presence (PRL) or absence (C) of 200 ng/ml of PRL (n = 9 each) indicates a significant decrease in cell death in the presence of PRL. D, representative Western blot of INS-1 cells demonstrates increased level of cleaved caspase-3 protein after treatment with 0.5 mm or 1 mm STZ in PBS-treated control cells. Preculture with 200 ng/ml of PRL reduces the level of cleaved caspase-3 in STZ-treated cells, with actin as an internal control. E, densitometric analysis of Western blots (n = 5) shows an increase in the ratio of cleaved caspase-3/actin in control (gray bars) INS-1 cells treated with increasing concentrations of STZ. Treatment with PRL (white bars) reduces activation of cleaved caspase-3 and the reduction is significant at 0.5 mm STZ.

Glucocorticoid levels become elevated under various physiological and pathophysiological conditions, such as stress (25Munck A. Guyre P.M. Holbrook N.J. Endocr.

Therefore, we examined the ability of lactogens to protect beta cells against DEX-induced cell death. Normal islet cells precultured with/without exogenous PRL, or mPL1 transgenic islet cells, were treated with DEX, (500 nm for 48 h) and beta cell death was quantitated by TUNEL and insulin co-staining (Fig. 2A).

For example, overexpression of MPS1 in S. cerevisiae results in inappropriate checkpoint activation (12Weiss E. Winey M. J.

The activity of hMps1 rises to an extent greater than what can be explained by the increase in protein level alone during the G2/M transition (9Stucke V.M. Sillje H.H. Arnaud L. Nigg E.A. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1723-1732Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 23Hogg D. Guidos C. Bailey D. Amendola A. Groves T. Davidson J. Schmandt R. Mills G. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 89-96PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, checkpoint activation with nocodazole treatment of cells results in a ∼30-fold increase in hMps1 activity, whereas the protein level remains similar to untreated mitotic cells (9Stucke V.M. Sillje H.H. Arnaud L. Nigg E.A. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1723-1732Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Increased hMps1 activity is correlated with more slowly electrophoretically migrating forms thought to be the result of phosphorylation (7Liu S.T. Chan G.K. Hittle J.C. Fujii G. Lees E. Yen T.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 1638-1651Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 9Stucke V.M. Sillje H.H. Arnaud L. Nigg E.A. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1723-1732Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that Mps1 is also regulated by changes in phosphorylation state.Many kinases are activated when phosphorylated within the activation loop (reviewed in Refs. 26Johnson L.N. Noble M. Owen D. Cell. 1996; 85: 149-158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1161) Google Scholar, 27Morgan D.O. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev.

In some cases, this can be catalyzed by autophosphorylation. For example, ERK8 autophosphorylates in vitro on both Thr and Tyr residues for activation, and this is also the likely method for activation in vivo (29Klevernic I.V. Stafford M.J. Morrice N. Peggie M. Morton S. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 2006; 394: 365-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Although it is not clear which other kinases or regulatory subunits (if any) play a role in Mps1 activation, it is well known that Mps1 autophosphorylates in vitro (2Lauze' E. Stoelcker B. Luca F.C.

Cell. 1998; 9: 759-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Tryptic digestion and sequencing of a radiolabeled catalytically active hMps1 fragment isolated from Escherichia coli indicates that Thr676 in the activation loop is a likely site for autophosphorylation (31Lindberg R.A. Fischer W.H. Hunter T. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 351-359PubMed Google Scholar).In this study, we sought to identify and characterize the role of autophosphorylation in Mps1 activity. We find that both yeast and human Mps1 autophosphorylate in the activation loop at a conserved residue. Mutation of this residue (Thr676 in human and the corresponding Thr591 in yeast) decreases kinase activity in vitro and inhibits function in vivo. This observation clearly demonstrates that Mps1 autophosphorylation is essential for function.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCloning, Mutagenesis, and Purification of hMps1—The pGEX-hMps1-ha plasmid and purification of GST-hMps1-ha protein have been described previously (16Fisk H.A. Mattison C.P. Winey M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 14875-14880Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). The addition of GST did not adversely affect kinase activity, because proteolytic cleavage of this moiety from hMps1 did not significantly alter kinase activity. We determined that GST-hMps1-ha isolated from E. coli has specific activity of 11.6 pmol/min-mg toward myelin basic protein and 3.6 pmol/min-mg for autophosphorylation. This is comparable with the activity of the yeast enzyme isolated from yeast, which we estimate to be 34.9 pmol/min-mg for myelin basic protein and 3.11 pmol/min-mg for autophosphorylation.hMPS1 mutations were generated by site-directed PCR mutagenesis using cloned Pfu DNA Polymerase (Stratagene). PCR fragments were digested with BspEI and SacI and ligated into the pGEX-hMps1-ha plasmid to generate mutant alleles. Combinatorial mutants were generated by sequential mutagenesis. For expression of hMps1 mutant alleles in cells, mutations were subcloned into the pHF36 plasmid (16Fisk H.A. Mattison C.P. Winey M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 14875-14880Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) after digestion with BspEI and SacI. All of the mutant alleles were verified by sequencing, and the proteins were purified in a manner identical to wild type.Cells and Culture Conditions—RPE1 and U2OS cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone) and penicillin-streptomycin (Invitrogen). Expression of wild type and mutant hMps1 alleles in vivo was done using the plasmid pHF36 (16Fisk H.A. Mattison C.P. Winey M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 14875-14880Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). DNA was purified using MAXI preps (Qiagen) and transfected into cells using Effectene (Qiagen).Kinase Assays—Unless otherwise noted, wild type and mutant kinase assays were performed with 200 ng of purified hMps1 in kinase assay buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mg/ml MBP, 0.1 mm ATP) for 20 min at 30 °C. For phosphatase treatment, hMps1 bound to Glutathione-Sepharose resin (Amersham Biosciences) was incubated in the presence of 4000 units of lambda phosphatase (New England Biolabs) at 30 °C for 2 h, followed by extensive washing in phosphate-buffered saline to remove the phosphatase and a final wash in 1× kinase assay buffer before assaying kinase activity. Coomassie-stained kinase bands were scanned using the Odyssey imaging system (Li-Cor) and normalized to autoradiography units to compensate for small errors in loading and more accurately reflect kinase activity.Western Blotting—Human Mps1 protein was electrophoresed on 10% SDS-PAGE gels and then transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. After blocking in TBST (0.1% Tween 20) with 6% milk and 1% bovine serum albumin, the blots were simultaneously probed with either 1:1000 rabbit polyclonal IgG sc-540 anti-hMps1 (TTK C-19; Santa Cruz) or 1:1000 anti-Mps1 NT clone 3–472-1 (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.), and mouse monoclonal IgG2b anti-Tyr(P) sc-7020 (p-Tyr PY99; Santa Cruz) or rabbit anti-Thr(P) (Zymed Laboratories Inc.). After three 5-ml washes with TBST, the blots were incubated with the appropriate secondary antibodies: Alexa 680-conjugated anti-rabbit or anti-mouse (Molecular Probes), IRDye800-conjugated anti-mouse, or anti-rabbit (Rockland Immunochemicals). Following three final 5-ml TBST washes, the blots were visualized using the Odyssey imaging system (Li-Cor).Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Immunofluorescence microscopy was performed as described in Ref. 16Fisk H.A. Mattison C.P. Winey M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 14875-14880Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar using the polyclonal anti-γ-tubulin antibody (Sigma). The values for centrosome number reflect the averages ± standard deviation of three experiments in which at least 100 GFP-positive cells were counted for γ-tubulin-positive spots.Peptide Identification by Electrospray Ionization-Liquid Chromatography-Tandem Mass Spectrometry (LC/MS/MS)–GST-hMps1-ha purified from E. coli was reduced with 10 mm dithiothreitol at 37 °C for 1 h, alkylated with 50 mm iodoacetamide at room temperature in the dark for 1 h, and then digested with 2% (w/w) sequencing grade trypsin (Promega), incubating overnight at 37 °C with gentle agitation. After acidification with formic acid, the samples were analyzed using a 4000 QTrap mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) interfaced with a NanoLC-2D HPLC (Eksigent, Dublin, CA), using a 75-μm × 15-cm Zorbax 300SB-C18 analytical nanocolumn (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA) for peptide separation. Buffer A was 0.1% formic acid and buffer B was 95% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid. An Endurance autosampler (Eksigent, Dublin, CA) was used to load the samples onto a 5-μm, 5 × 0.3-mm Zorbax 300SB-C18 trap column (Agilent Technologies) at 20 μl/min in 98% A, 2% B. After 5 min of washing, the trap column was switched in-line with the analytical column, and the gradient program and acquisition was started. Post-column auxillary flow was required for stable spray in negative mode, consisting of 80% 2-propanol at a flow rate of 300 nl/min from a Harvard syringe pump connected to the post-column flow with a Microtee tubing adapter (Upchurch, Oak Harbor, WA). The gradient program was run at a flow rate of 300 nl/min: 2% to 50% B in 82 min, 50–100% B in 15 min, and 100% B for 5 min. The column was recycled by washing in 98% A, 2% B.Phosphopeptides were first detected by phosphopeptide precursor ion analysis, followed by a second targeted positive mode LC/MS/MS run to identify the peptides (33Carr S.A. Annan R.S. Huddleston M.J. Methods Enzymol. 2005; 405: 82-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In the first run, phosphopeptides were detected by precursor ion scanning in negative mode with an ion spray voltage of–2200 V applied to a PicoTip needle (FS360-75-15-N-20-C12; New Objective, Woburn, MA) monitoring for the marker ion PO–3 at–79 m/z, over a mass range of 500–1800 m/z, with Q1 set to low resolution and Q3 set to unit resolution. When the signal intensity of the precursor ion scan was above a threshold of 4000 cps, a high resolution scan in negative mode was performed for charge determination and accurate mass measurement. A mass list of candidate phosphopeptides was then generated and used as an inclusion list for targeted positive mode LC/MS/MS. This consisted of a linear ion trap survey scan, a high resolution scan, and MS/MS sequencing for targeted ions that matched masses on the inclusion list. MS/MS were searched with MASCOT (version 2.0, MatrixScience, London, UK) using a small data base of 20 standard proteins, including the sequence of the GST-hMps1-ha. Parent mass tolerance was 1.2 Da and MS/MS tolerance was 0.8 Da, with fixed modifications set to carbamidomethyl cysteine, variable methionine oxidation, and variable phosphorylation at Ser, Thr, and Tyr. MS/MS identifications with MASCOT scores above 25 were then manually validated for quality and phosphorylation site determination.Matrix-assisted Laser Desorption Ionization-Time-of-Flight (MALDI-TOF) Analysis of Yeast Mps1—Yeast Mps1 was overexpressed with a plasmid borne GST fusion (described in Ref. 2Lauze' E. Stoelcker B. Luca F.C. Weiss E. Schutz A. Winey M. EMBO Eur. Mol. Biol. Organ. J. 1995; 14: 1655-1663Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) in wild type yeast cells from a galactose inducible promoter. GST-Mps1p was isolated from cell lysates by binding to glutathione beads (GE Healthcare). The samples were separated on an 8.5% SDS-PAGE gel and stained with imidazole/zinc to visualize GST-Mps1p, and the protein band was excised from the gel (34Fernandez-Patron C. Castellanos-Serra L. Rodriguez P. BioTechniques. 1992; 12: 564-573PubMed Google Scholar). Gel slices were destained with citric acid, reduced with dithiothreitol, and alkylated with iodoacetamide. Gel slices were then washed, dehydrated with acetonitrile, and completely dried by speed vac. The gel slices were reswelled in 15 μl trypsin/ammonium bicarbonate and allowed to digest overnight. Tryptic peptides were extracted from the gel slices, the supernatant was dried, and the sample was reconstituted in trifluoroacetic acid. The peptide sample was mixed with matrix and spotted onto a MALDI plate for analysis.RESULTSHyperphosphorylation of hMps1 Is Not Required for Activity–We isolated full-length recombinant hMps1 fused to both N-terminal GST and C-terminal hemagglutinin tags from E. coli to study the role of hMps1 autophosphorylation. Wild type GST-hMps1-ha contained multiple forms, some of which migrate more slowly in SDS-PAGE and are immunoreactive with anti-phosphotyrosine and anti-phosphothreonine antibodies (Fig. 1A). This suggested the kinase was highly phosphorylated and is consistent with changes in hMps1 electrophoretic migration previously noted in mitotic cells (7Liu S.T. Chan G.K. Hittle J.C. Fujii G. Lees E. Yen T.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 1638-1651Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 9Stucke V.M. Sillje H.H. Arnaud L. Nigg E.A.

In contrast, the kinase dead (hMps1-KD, D664A) enzyme isolated in the same manner showed only fast migrating forms of the kinase as seen previously (2Lauze' E. Stoelcker B. Luca F.C. Weiss E. Schutz A. Winey M. EMBO Eur. Mol. Biol. Organ. J. 1995; 14: 1655-1663Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 3Poch O. Schwob E. Fraipont F. Camasses A. Bordonne' R. Martin R. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1994; 243: 641-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), strongly suggesting gel mobility retardation was due to autophosphorylation (Fig. 1A). To confirm that the decreased mobility of wild type hMps1 was due to phosphorylation, we treated isolated glutathione-Sepharose-bound hMps1 with lambda phosphatase. This treatment increased gel mobility and produced a banding pattern similar to that of the kinase dead protein (Fig. 1B). Phosphatase treatment also abolished immunoreactivity with anti-Tyr(P) and anti-Thr(P) antibodies. Thus, full-length hMps1 isolated from E. coli autophosphorylates. To determine whether autophosphorylation occurred in trans, we incubated kinase dead hMps1 with active hMps1. We found that hMps1-KD was phosphorylated, indicating that hMps1 autophosphorylation can occur through an intermolecular reaction (Fig. 1C). In our assay the kinase dead protein was phosphorylated with a stoichiometry of 0.8 mol phosphate/mol of hMps1, suggesting that a single residue was phosphorylated.We compared the incorporation of 32P into MBP by hMps1 treated with phosphatase with that of mock treated hMps1 to investigate the effect of autophosphorylation on hMps1 kinase activity. Surprisingly, phosphatase-treated hMps1 had kinase activity comparable with the untreated hMps1 (Fig. 2, A and B). Further, for the duration of the kinase assay phosphatase-treated hMps1 remained in the faster migrating form and retained activity without recovery of anti-Thr(P) and anti-Tyr(P) immunoreactivity (Fig. 2C and data not shown). Conceivably, hMps1 autophosphorylation may not be required for activity and may serve other purposes in vivo. Alternatively, phosphorylated residues important for activity were missed by the phosphatase or were again phosphorylated by hMps1 after phosphatase treatment. If so, phosphorylation at these sites does not cause gel mobility retardation nor allow recognition by the anti-Tyr(P) or anti-Thr(P) antibodies we used. We sought to resolve this question by identifying hMps1 autophosphorylation sites and determining their importance for kinase activity.FIGURE 2hMps1 retains kinase activity after dephosphorylation. A, approximately 100 ng of either phosphatase-treated or untreated purified GSH bead-bound GST-hMps1-ha was used for in vitro kinase assays in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP. Bead-bound kinase was incubated in kinase assay buffer with 100 μm cold ATP and 1 mg of MBP at 30 °C for the indicated times. Following SDS-PAGE, phosphorylation of MBP substrate was analyzed by autoradiography (autorad). B, phosphoryl [γ-32P]ATP transfer to MBP was normalized to hMps1 protein level and plotted against time for mock and phosphatase-treated GSH bead-bound GST-hMps1-ha. The graph shown is representative of at least three independent experiments. Phosphatase-treated hMps1 is represented by white squares, and untreated hMps1 is represented by black circles. Radiography units were normalized to the intensity of Coomassie-stained kinase bands for each time point using the Odyssey imaging system (Li-Cor, Lincoln, NE). Analysis of [γ-32P]ATP incorporation by autophosphorylation generated similar results (not shown). C, approximately 100 ng of either phosphatase-treated or untreated purified GSH bead-bound GST-hMps1-ha was used for in vitro kinase assays lacking [γ-32P]ATP for the indicated times as in A. Following SDS-PAGE, the samples were immunoblotted with anti-hMps1 and anti-phosphothreonine antibodies.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)hMps1 Autophosphorylates on Thr675, Thr676, and Thr686 within the Activation Loop—The kinase activity of phosphatase-treated hMps1 was comparable with untreated hMps1, indicating that much of the autophosphorylation was dispensable for activity, as has been suggested previously (10Stucke V.M. Baumann C. Nigg E.A. Chromosoma. 2004; 113: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Therefore, we mapped autophosphorylation sites on GST-hMps1-ha isolated directly from E. coli, after phosphatase treatment, and following reactivation by autophosphorylation. We used a method for phosphopeptide-specific precursor ion scanning, which is described in Ref. 33Carr S.A. Annan R.S. Huddleston M.J. Methods Enzymol. 2005; 405: 82-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar. Using trypsin-digested hMps1, we observed greater than 89% coverage of the protein analyzed directly after isolation from E. coli. Phosphorylation of residues in the activation loop between kinase subdomains VII and VIII are known to be important for activation of several kinases (26Johnson L.N. Noble M. Owen D. Cell. 1996; 85: 149-158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1161) Google Scholar), and we focused our analysis on autophosphorylation sites detected within this region for the remainder of this study. Digestion of hMps1 with trypsin resulted in the generation of two peptides that spanned the activation loop, residues 662LIDFGIANQMQPDTTSVVK680 and 681DSQVGTVNYMPPEAIK696. Both of these peptides were detected by precursor ion scanning mass spectrometry, monitoring for the loss of PO–3 and subsequently sequenced for MS/MS identification and phosphorylation site mapping. The 662LIDFGIANQMQPDTTSVVK680 peptide was detected only in a phosphorylated form, whereas the phosphorylated form of the 681DSQVGTVNYMPPEAIK696 peptide was detected with variable stoichiometry of 5–60%. Both of these peptides were identified in an unphosphorylated form with a high degree of confidence in the hMps1-KD protein sample, but they were never detected in a phosphorylated form. This indicates that the phosphorylation sites we found in the wild type hMps1 protein were due solely to autophosphorylation. Three phosphorylated residues were found within these two peptides. Phosphorylation at residues Thr675, Thr676, and Thr686 (Fig. 3) was confirmed by the presence of fragment ions adjacent to and containing these phosphorylation sites in fragmentation spectra. Phosphorylation was observed at either Thr675 or Thr676 based on MS/MS of two MH2+2 ions corresponding to monophosphorylated peptide 662LIDFGIANQMQPDTTSVVK680, resolved by HPLC (Fig. 3, A and B). Doubly phosphorylated forms of this peptide were not observed in our analysis. MS/MS of the MH2+2 ion of monophosphorylated peptide 681DSQVGTVNYMPPEAIK696 revealed phosphorylation on Thr686 (Fig. 3C).FIGURE 3hMps1 autophosphorylates at Thr675, Thr676, and Thr686 in the activation loop.

https://openalex.org/W2062101590,"BLM, the protein mutated in Bloom's syndrome, possesses a helicase activity that can dissociate DNA structures, including the Holliday junction, expected to arise during homologous recombination. BLM is stably associated with topoisomerase IIIα (Topo IIIα) and the BLAP75 protein. The BLM-Topo IIIα-BLAP75 (BTB) complex can efficiently resolve a DNA substrate that harbors two Holliday junctions (the double Holliday junction) in a non-crossover manner. Here we show that the Holliday junction unwinding activity of BLM is greatly enhanced as a result of its association with Topo IIIα and BLAP75. Enhancement of this BLM activity requires both Topo IIIα and BLAP75. Importantly, Topo IIIα cannot be substituted by Escherichia coli Top3, and the Holliday junction unwinding activity of BLM-related helicases WRN and RecQ is likewise impervious to Topo IIIα and BLAP75. However, the topoisomerase activity of Topo IIIα is dispensable for the enhancement of the DNA unwinding reaction. We have also ascertained the requirement for the BLM ATPase activity in double Holliday junction dissolution and DNA unwinding by constructing, purifying, and characterizing specific mutant variants that lack this activity. These results provide valuable information concerning how the functional integrity of the BTB complex is governed by specific protein-protein interactions among the components of this complex and the enzymatic activities of BLM and Topo IIIα. BLM, the protein mutated in Bloom's syndrome, possesses a helicase activity that can dissociate DNA structures, including the Holliday junction, expected to arise during homologous recombination. BLM is stably associated with topoisomerase IIIα (Topo IIIα) and the BLAP75 protein. The BLM-Topo IIIα-BLAP75 (BTB) complex can efficiently resolve a DNA substrate that harbors two Holliday junctions (the double Holliday junction) in a non-crossover manner. Here we show that the Holliday junction unwinding activity of BLM is greatly enhanced as a result of its association with Topo IIIα and BLAP75. Enhancement of this BLM activity requires both Topo IIIα and BLAP75. Importantly, Topo IIIα cannot be substituted by Escherichia coli Top3, and the Holliday junction unwinding activity of BLM-related helicases WRN and RecQ is likewise impervious to Topo IIIα and BLAP75. However, the topoisomerase activity of Topo IIIα is dispensable for the enhancement of the DNA unwinding reaction. We have also ascertained the requirement for the BLM ATPase activity in double Holliday junction dissolution and DNA unwinding by constructing, purifying, and characterizing specific mutant variants that lack this activity. These results provide valuable information concerning how the functional integrity of the BTB complex is governed by specific protein-protein interactions among the components of this complex and the enzymatic activities of BLM and Topo IIIα. Homologous recombination (HR) 3The abbreviations used are: HR, homologous recombination; BS, Bloom's syndrome; HJ, Holliday junction; DHJ, double-Holliday junction; GST, glutathione S-transferase; DTT, dithiothreitol; AMP-PNP, adenosine 5′-(β,γ-imino)triphosphate; ATPγS, adenosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate); ADP, adenosine 3′,5′-diphosphate; BTB, BLM-Topo IIIα-BLAP75. is important for several nuclear processes, including the repair of damaged DNA, rescue of stalled DNA replication forks, and pairing of homologous chromosomes during meiosis. HR can produce recombinant chromosomes that harbor a crossover of the chromosomal arms. Although these crossovers are critical for the proper segregation of homologous chromosomes in meiosis I (1Bishop D.K. Kim D. Cell. 2004; 117: 9-15Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar), inadvertent crossover formation in mitotic cells can lead to chromosome translocation and loss of heterozygosity, which are potentially oncogenic (2Richardson C. Kim M. Nature. 2000; 405: 697-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar, 3Ferguson D.O. Kim F.W. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 5572-5579Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar, 4Richards R.I.

For this reason, eukaryotes have developed specific mechanisms for suppressing the formation of DNA crossovers in mitotic cells (7Richardson C. Kim M.E. Jasin M. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3831-3842Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar, 8Johnson R.D. Kim M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3398-3407Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar, 9Ira G. Kim A. Liberi G.

Several members of the RecQ helicase family have been implicated in mitotic crossover suppression (reviewed in 10-12). BLM, the protein mutated in the autosomal recessive cancer-predisposing disorder Bloom's syndrome (BS), is one of the five members of the RecQ helicase family in humans (13Ellis N.A. Kim J. Ye T.Z.

Cytogenet. 1986; 22: 1-18Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). BLM is thought to prevent crossover formation by (i) promoting the synthesis-dependent single strand annealing pathway of HR by dissociating the D-loop structure, an intermediate formed early in the HR reaction, and (ii) acting in conjunction with additional protein factors to dissolve the double-Holliday junction (DHJ), a late HR intermediate, to generate solely non-crossover recombinants (18Karow J.K.

BLM has also been proposed to function in the rescue of stalled replication forks, perhaps by promoting fork regression to form a Holliday junction (HJ) intermediate (21Ralf C. Kim I.D. Wu L. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 22839-22846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). The regressed fork can then be dissociated by branch migration of the HJ to allow bypass of the blocking lesion through template switching or be utilized as a substrate for HR to mediate replication restart (22Wu L. Kim I.D. Annu. Rev. Genet. 2006; 40: 279-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). In its DHJ dissolution role, BLM acts specifically with the type IA topoisomerase Topo IIIα (20Wu L. Kim I.D. Nature. 2003; 426: 870-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (876) Google Scholar). The BLM-Topo IIIα pair is tightly associated with a third protein called BLAP75 (23Meetei A.R. Kim S. Wallisch M. Yang D. Young M.K. Joenje H. Hoatlin M.E. Wang W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 3417-3426Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Attenuation of BLAP75 levels by RNA interference destabilizes both BLM and Topo IIIα (24Yin J. Kim A. Xu C. Meetei A.R. Hoatlin M. Li L. Wang W. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 1465-1476Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Biochemical analyses have revealed specific and direct interactions of BLAP75 with BLM and Topo IIIα and a strong enhancement of the BLM-Topo IIIα-mediated DHJ dissolution reaction by this novel protein (25Wu L. Kim C.Z. Ou J. Xu C. Yin J. Chang M. Wang W. Li L. Brown G.W. Hickson I.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 4068-4073Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 26Raynard S. Kim W. Sung P. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 13861-13864Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Parallel studies in other eukaryotes have led to the notion that the mechanism of BLM-mediated crossover suppression is evolutionarily conserved (11Mankouri H.W. Kim I.D. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2004; 32: 957-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 27Sung P. Kim H. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 7: 739-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar). In particular, the absence of Sgs1, the sole RecQ-like helicase in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, increases crossover formation in double-strand break-induced HR (9Ira G. Kim A. Liberi G. Foiani M. Haber J.E. Cell. 2003; 115: 401-411Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar) and causes HR-dependent aberrant DNA structures to accumulate during replication in response to DNA damage (28Liberi G.

SGS1 was initially identified as a suppressor of the slow growth phenotype of strains mutated for the TOP3 gene, the orthologue of human Topo IIIα (29Gangloff S. Kim J.P. Bendixen C. Arthur L. Rothstein R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 8391-8398Crossref PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar). Mutations in TOP3 phenocopy the sgs1 mutant in both increased crossover formation and accumulation of recombination-dependent aberrant DNA structures (10Hickson I.D. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 169-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar, 28Liberi G. Kim G. Lucca C. Chiolo I. Baryshnikova A. Cotta-Ramusino C. Lopes M. Pellicioli A. Haber J.E. Foiani M. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 339-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar), reinforcing the idea that Sgs1 and Top3 function together to resolve HR intermediates in a non-crossover manner. Furthermore, Rmi1, the putative yeast ortholog of BLAP75 (30Chang M. Kim M. Zhang C. Desai R. Morozov P. Delgado-Cruzata L. Rothstein R. Freyer G.A. Boone C. Brown G.W.

Biol. 2005; 25: 4476-4487Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), co-immunoprecipitates with the Sgs1-Top3 complex, and deletion of either Top3 or Rmi1 destabilizes the heteromeric complex (31Mullen J.R. Kim F.S. Lan Y.Q. Slagle C.E. Brill S.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 4476-4487Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Rmi1 mutants exhibit hyper-recombination and increased gross chromosomal rearrangements (30Chang M. Kim M. Zhang C. Desai R. Morozov P. Delgado-Cruzata L. Rothstein R. Freyer G.A. Boone C. Brown G.W.

Biol. 2005; 25: 4476-4487Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The mechanistic details that underlie the action of the BTB complex and its equivalent in other organisms remain poorly characterized. Here we demonstrate that BLAP75 in conjunction with Topo IIIα greatly stimulates the HJ unwinding activity of BLM. This functional interaction is highly specific, as the BLAP75-Topo IIIα pair has no effect on either WRN (a RecQ helicase) or Escherichia coli RecQ helicase activity, nor can E. coli Top3 substitute for Topo IIIα in the enhancement of the BLM helicase activity. We provide evidence that the stimulation of the BLM helicase activity is independent of the catalytic activity of Topo IIIα. Lastly, we address the role of ATP hydrolysis by BLM in the BTB complex functions by mutating the conserved lysine residue in its Walker A motif needed for ATP binding and hydrolysis. The BLM K695A and K695R mutant proteins are both devoid of ATPase and helicase activities and the ability to catalyze DHJ dissolution within the context of the BTB complex. Protein Expression and Purification—See the supplemental data for details. DNA Substrates—The ϕX174 viral (+) strand and replicative form I DNAs were purchased from Invitrogen. The oligonucleotides used for this study were synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies and are listed in Table 1. All the oligonucleotides were purified from 12% denaturing polyacrylamide gels containing 8 m urea prior to use. Oligos P1 and P2 were annealed to create a forked substrate that harbored a 25-bp duplex region with 25 nucleotides non-complementary single-strand tails. The HJ (four-way X-junction) substrate was prepared by annealing oligos 2, 5, 6, and 7 (32Osman F. Kim J. Barr A.R. Whitby M.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 8084-8096Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 33Macris M.A. Kim L. Bussen W. Shimamoto A. Sung P. DNA Repair (Amst.). 2006; 5: 172-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Briefly, oligos P1 and P7 were 5′ end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs). The unincorporated nucleotide was removed by passage through a Biospin-6 column (Bio-Rad). Annealing reactions were carried out by heating equimolar amounts of the indicated oligonucleotides at 95 °C for 10 min in annealing buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT) followed by slow cooling to room temperature. Subsequent steps were carried out at 4 °C to prevent dissociation of the annealed DNA strands. The DNA substrates were separated from the unhybridized oligonucleotides in 12% polyacrylamide gels run in TAE buffer (30 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.4, 0.5 mm EDTA). The relevant portions of the gel were excised and the annealed DNA substrates eluted from the gel slices by electro-elution (30 mA overnight) into TAE buffer in dialysis tubing. The substrates were concentrated in a YM-30 Centricon device and filter dialyzed into TE buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 8, 1 mm EDTA). Radiolabeled oligo B1 and unlabeled oligo R1 were annealed and ligated to create a DHJ substrate as described (20Wu L. Kim I.D.

Rabbit polyclonal anti-BLM antibody (0.4 μl of a 1:5 dilution of ab476; Abcam Ltd.) was added, followed by a 30-min incubation at 4 °C. The reactions were incubated for 30 min at 4 °C with 10 μl of Protein-G coupled magnetic beads (Dynal Biotech) to capture BLM and associated Topo IIIα. The beads were isolated using a magnet, washed twice with 30 μl of buffer K containing 150 mm KCl, and the bound proteins were eluted with 30 μl of SDS-PAGE sample loading buffer.

ATPase assay—In Fig. 3A, combinations of BLM (10 nm), BLAP75 (50 nm), and Topo IIIα (120 nm) were incubated at 37 °C with ϕX174 viral (+) strand DNA (70 μm nucleotides), 1 mm ATP, and 1 μCi [γ-32P]ATP in 10 μl of buffer R (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 250 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 25 mm KCl, 4 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm DTT). In Fig. 7C, ATP hydrolysis by BLM, BLM K695A, or BLM K695R protein (80 nm each) was examined in 10 μl of buffer R containing ϕX174 viral (+) strand DNA (70 μm nucleotides), 2 mm ATP, and 1 μCi [γ-32P]ATP. At the indicated times, a 2.5 μl aliquot of the reaction was removed and mixed with an equal volume of 1% SDS. The level of ATP hydrolysis was measured by thin layer chromatography in polyethyleneimine cellulose sheets (35Petukhova G. Kim S. Sung P.

After 20 min, the reaction mixtures were resolved in 10% native polyacrylamide gels in TAE buffer. Where indicated, reactions were deproteinized by treatment with SDS and proteinase K (0.2% and 0.5 mg/ml, respectively) at 37 °C for 3 min prior to gel analysis. The gels were dried onto Whatman DE81 paper and subjected to analysis in a Bio-Rad Personal FX phosphorimager. HJ Unwinding—Combinations of BLM (10 nm), Topo IIIα (120 nm), and BLAP75 (50 nm or amount as indicated) were incubated on ice for 10 min in 9.5 μl of buffer H (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm DTT, 2 mm ATP, 0.8 mm MgCl2, 200 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, and an ATP regenerating system consisting of 20 mm creatine phosphate and 20 μg/ml creatine kinase) containing either 100 mm or the indicated concentration of KCl. Following the addition of the radiolabeled HJ substrate (0.5 nm) in 0.5 μl of TE buffer, the reactions were incubated for an additional 10 min (or the indicated times) at 37 °C. After treatment with SDS and proteinase K as above, the deproteinized reaction mixtures were resolved in 10% native polyacrylamide gels in TAE buffer and analyzed as above.

In Fig. 2B, the reaction volume was increased to 60 μl, and a 10-μl aliquot was removed at the indicated time points, deproteinized, and analyzed as above. DNA Fork Unwinding—BLM, BLM K695A, or BLM K695R (amount as indicated) protein was incubated at 37 °C with the radiolabeled forked DNA (0.5 nm) in 10 μl of buffer H containing 40 mm KCl.

DHJ Dissolution Assay—BLM, BLM K695A, or BLM K695R (10 nm) was incubated with Topo IIIα or Topo IIIα Y337F (120 nm) and BLAP75 (50 nm) for 10 min on ice in 11.5 μl of reaction buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 2 mm ATP, 0.8 mm MgCl2, 80 mm KCl, 1 mm DTT, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, and the ATP-regenerating system described above) followed by the addition of the DHJ substrate (1.2 nm) in 1 μl of TE buffer. After a 5-min incubation at 37 °C, the reaction mixtures were deproteinized as above, mixed with 10 μl of sample loading buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50% glycerol, and 0.08% Orange G) containing 50% urea, incubated at 95 °C for 3 min, and resolved in an 8% polyacrylamide gel containing 20% formamide and 8 m urea in TAE buffer at 55 °C. In Fig. 9A, ATP was omitted or substituted with ATPγS, AMP-PNP, or ADP (2 mm each) as indicated. The ATP regenerating system was omitted from the reactions that used ADP or the non-hydrolyzable ATP analogues. In Fig. 9B, WRN (15 nm) or RECQ5 (15 nm) was included where indicated. Expression and Purification of the BTB Components—C-terminally His6-tagged BLM was expressed using the yeast galactose-inducible BLM expression system of Karow et al. (36Karow J.K. Kim R.K. Hickson I.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30611-30614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). N-terminally His6-tagged Topo IIIα was expressed in E. coli Rosetta (DE3) pLysS cells (Novagen) from an isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside-inducible T7 promoter. BLM and Topo IIIα were purified to >95% homogeneity by multi-step purification schemes that we developed (Fig. 1, B-E). The purified Topo IIIα is catalytically active as evidenced by its ability to relax negatively supercoiled ϕX174 DNA (data not shown) and to function in the DHJ dissolution reaction (26Raynard S. Kim W. Sung P. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 13861-13864Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar; see below). BLAP75 was expressed and purified from E. coli using our published procedure (26Raynard S. Kim W. Sung P. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 13861-13864Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). As controls in the biochemical analyses, we obtained the E. coli RecQ and Top3 proteins from the Kowalczykowski group (University of California) and the RECQ5 protein from the Janscak group (IMCR, University of Zurich). Effects of BLAP75 and Topo IIIα on BLM-mediated ATP Hydrolysis and HJ Unwinding—We tested the effect of BLAP75 and Topo IIIα on BLM-mediated unwinding of a 32P-labeled synthetic HJ. Although neither BLAP75 nor Topo IIIα alone had a significant effect on the extent of HJ unwinding (Fig. 2A, lanes 3 and 4), pre-incubation of all three proteins led to a marked enhancement of the reaction (lanes 5-7). Time course experiments showed dissociation of ∼50% and >80% of the HJ substrate by the BTB complex in 2 and 10 min, respectively (Fig. 2B). In comparison, BLM unwound <2 and 14% of the HJ substrate within the same timeframes, respectively (Fig. 2B). Unwinding of the HJ substrate required ATP hydrolysis, as the products were not seen when ATP was omitted or when ATP was replaced by ADP, AMP-PNP, or ATPγS (data not shown). In agreement with this, BLM variants harboring mutations in the conserved lysine residue of the Walker A motif that ablate ATPase activity are also devoid of HJ unwinding activity (see below). As expected, neither BLAP75 nor Topo IIIα alone or in combination could dissociate the HJ substrate in the absence of BLM (Fig. 2A, lane 8 and data not shown). We examined whether Topo IIIα and BLAP75 increased the rate of ATP hydrolysis by BLM, but saw no stimulation by these proteins when they were used either alone or in combination (Fig. 3A). The above HJ unwinding experiments were performed in the presence of 100 mm KCl. We previously showed that under more physiological salt conditions, the DHJ dissolution activity of BLM and Topo IIIα becomes almost completely dependent on the presence of BLAP75 (26Raynard S. Kim W. Sung P. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 13861-13864Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). In concordance with this, elevating the salt concentration to 140 mm reduced HJ unwinding by BLM, whereas the level of unwinding catalyzed by the BTB complex was not affected significantly (Fig. 3B). Specificity of Enhancement of BLM Activities by Topo IIIα and BLAP75—To address the specificity of the functional interactions documented in the last section, we substituted BLM with two other members of the RecQ helicase family, namely, the human WRN and E. coli RecQ helicases. Both WRN and RecQ unwind the HJ structure (37Mohaghegh P. Kim J.K. Brosh Jr. R.M. Bohr V.A. Hickson I.D.

As shown in Fig. 4A, under conditions wherein a strong enhancement of the BLM HJ unwinding activity by BLAP75 and Topo IIIα was seen, the addition of the latter two proteins had no effect on HJ unwinding by either WRN or RecQ. Previously published studies have shown that the E. coli Top3 protein, which is also a type IA topoisomerase, can function with BLM in DHJ dissolution (25Wu L. Kim C.Z. Ou J. Xu C. Yin J. Chang M.

Vindigni A. Janscak P. Keck J.L. Hickson I.D. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 2679-2687Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). We asked whether Top3 protein could co-operate with BLAP75 to enhance the DNA unwinding activity of BLM. As shown in Fig. 4B, HJ unwinding by BLM was refractory to Top3, regardless of whether BLAP75 was present or not. Affinity pull-down assays provide evidence that Top3 does not interact with either BLM or BLAP75 (data not shown). Taken together, the results indicate that the enhancement of the BLM activities by Topo IIIα and BLAP75 occurs in a highly specific fashion, likely reflective of the specific protein-protein interactions that occur within the context of the BTB complex. The DNA Relaxation Activity of Topo IIIα Is Dispensable for Stimulation of HJ Unwinding—To determine the role of the DNA relaxation activity of Topo IIIα in BTB complex functions, we used site-directed mutagenesis to generate a catalytically dead Topo IIIα mutant by changing the active site tyrosine residue (amino acid 337) to phenylalanine (40Hanai R. Kim P.R. Wang J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 3653-3657Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The Topo IIIα Y337F mutant could be expressed to the same level as the wild type protein and was purified to near homogeneity using the procedure that we devised for the wild type protein (Fig. 5A). A prolonged incubation of the Y337F mutant Topo IIIα protein with ϕX174 RF1 DNA did not result in any topological change in the DNA, confirming that the mutant protein was devoid of DNA relaxation activity (data not shown). In accordance with previously published data (20Wu L. Kim I.D. Nature. 2003; 426: 870-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (876) Google Scholar), the catalytically inactive Topo IIIα Y337F mutant is incapable of catalyzing DHJ dissolution with BLM, with or without BLAP75 (Fig. 5D). The lack of dissolution activity in the BTB complex that harbors Topo IIIα Y337F mutant protein is not because of a defect in complex assembly, as Topo IIIα Y337F retains the ability to bind both BLM and BLAP75 (Fig. 5, B and C) and stimulates DNA unwinding by BLM in conjunction with BLAP75 (see below). The results presented earlier demonstrate that BLAP75 and Topo IIIα together enhance the HJ unwinding activity of BLM. Because dissociation of the synthetic HJ substrate is not expected to be dependent on a DNA relaxation activity, we predicted that the Topo IIIα Y337F protein would retain the ability to up-regulate the BLM HJ unwinding activity in conjunction with BLAP75. As shown in Fig. 6, Topo IIIα Y337F is just as proficient as its wil"
https://openalex.org/W2060242223,"CD22/Siglec-2, an important inhibitory co-receptor on B-lymphocytes, is known to recognize α2-6-sialylated glycan as a specific ligand. Here we propose that the α2-6-sialylated and 6-GlcNAc-sulfated determinant serves as a preferred ligand for CD22 because the binding of a human B-cell line to CD22 was almost completely abrogated after incubating the cells with NaClO3, an inhibitor of cellular sulfate metabolism, and was also significantly inhibited by a newly generated monoclonal antibody specific to the α2-6-sialylated 6-sulfo-N-acetyllactosamine (LacNAc) determinant (KN343, murine IgM). The α2-6-sialylated 6-sulfo-LacNAc determinant defined by the antibody was significantly expressed on a majority of normal human peripheral B-lymphocytes as well as follicular B-lymphocytes in peripheral lymph nodes. The determinant was also expressed in endothelial cells of high endothelial venules of secondary lymphoid tissues, including lymph nodes, tonsils, and intestine-associated lymphoid tissues, more strongly than on B-lymphocytes, suggesting a role for CD22 in B-cell interaction with blood vessels and trafficking. These results indicate that the α2-6-sialylated 6-sulfo-LacNAc determinant serves as an endogenous ligand for human CD22 and suggest the possibility that 6-GlcNAc sulfation as well as α2-6-sialylation may regulate CD22/Siglec-2 functions in humans.

CD22/Siglec-2 (sialic acid-binding immunoglobulin-like lectins) is an important inhibitory receptor on B-lymphocytes. It controls the signaling threshold of B-cell receptors, preventing their overactivation (1Nitschke L. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2005; 17: 290-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 2Nitschke L.

It has inhibitory immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs in its cytoplasmic domain and regulates B-cell receptor signaling by recruiting the tyrosine phosphatase SHP-1 (Src homology 2 domain-containing protein-tyrosine phosphatase-1) (5Doody G.M.

It is known to also affect distribution and trafficking of B-lymphocytes, such as in the homing of IgD+ B-lymphocytes to the bone marrow (6Nitschke L. Kim H. Ferguson D.J. Crocker P.R. J. Exp.

Disruption of CD22 is known to result in production of high affinity autoantibodies, an increase in follicular mature B-lymphocytes, and a reduction in the number of marginal zone B-lymphocytes (7O'Keefe T.L.

B-lymphocytes themselves significantly express α2-6-sialylated glycan on their surface, which can serve as a cis-ligand for endogenous CD22, thus masking the ligand binding activity of CD22 on the majority of B-lymphocytes. CD22/Siglec-2 is proposed to exert trans-interaction with target cells expressing α2-6-sialylated glycans only when expression of the endogenous cis-ligand is suppressed or when the trans-ligand on target cells has a significantly higher binding activity than the cis-ligand (13Razi N.

For better understanding of CD22 function, it is important to know the diversity of α2-6-sialylated glycans and to find candidate glycans that preferentially bind to CD22. In mice, it has long been known that CD22 prefers the α2-6-N-glycolylsialic acid terminus over the α2-6-N-acetylsialic acid terminus (15Van der Merwe P.A. Kim P.R. Vinson M. Barclay A.N. Schauer R. Kelm S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9273-9280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Quite recently, it was proposed that the activity of CMP-NeuAc hydroxylase, which converts N-acetylsialic acid into N-glycolylsialic acid, plays a role in regulating CD22 activity (16Naito Y. Kim H. Koyama S. Miyake S. Yamamoto H. Fujinawa R. Sugai M. Okuno Y. Tsujimoto G. Yamaji T. Hashimoto Y. Itohara S. Kawasaki T. Suzuki A. Kozutsumi Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 3008-3022Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Another proposed candidate had been 9-O-acetylation of terminal sialic acid (17Sjoberg E.R. Kim L.D. Klein A. Varki A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 549-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Little is known in humans, however, about the heterogeneity of α2-6-sialylated glycans in terms of CD22 binding activity. It has been reported that an organochemically synthesized α2-6-sialylated and 6-sulfated glycan serves as a good ligand, eventually better than simply α2-6-sialylated determinants, for recombinant human CD22-Fc in an in vitro assay system (18Blixt O. Kim S. Mondala T. Scanlan C. Huflejt M.E. Alvarez R. Bryan M.C. Fazio F. Calarese D. Stevens J. Razi N. Stevens D.J. Skehel J.J. van Die I. Burton D.R. Wilson I.A. Cummings R. Bovin N. Wong C.H.

Our recent preliminary experiments indicated that suppression of carbohydrate sulfation abrogates binding of cultured human B-lymphoid cells to immobilized CD22 in a cell-based assay system (see “Results”). These findings collectively raised the possibility that some sulfated determinants also serve as preferred ligands for human CD22 at the cellular level. To address this issue, we tried to clarify the role of sulfation in the carbohydrate ligands for CD22 using a newly generated monoclonal antibody specific to the α2-6-sialylated 6-sulfo-N-acetyllactosamine (LacNAc) 2The abbreviations used are: LacNAc, N-acetyllactosamine (Galβ1→4GlcNAc); HEC-GlcNAc6ST, high endothelial cell GlcNAc-6-sulfotransferase; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; HEVs, high endothelial venules. determinant.

The recombinant α2-6-sialyltransferase from Photobacterium damselae JT0160 and the α2-3-sialyltransferase from P. damselae JT-ISH-467 (used to recover α2-6- and α2-3-linked sialic acid termini on the sialidase A-treated cells) were obtained from JT Plant Innovation Center (Iwata, Japan). Cells (1 × 106) were first fixed for 5 min in 0.5% paraformaldehyde and then sialidase A-treated for 1 h. After washings, the cells were reacted for 1 h at 30 °C in 1.0 ml of incubation mixture (pH 6.0) containing 10 μl of CMP-NeuAc (50 mg/ml; Sigma catalog no.

Peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-rat IgM (μ-chain specific; Zymed Laboratories Inc., South San Francisco, CA) was used for GL7, and peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgM (μ-chain specific; Cappel Laboratories, Malvern, PA) was used for other antibodies. The pure synthetic α2-6-sialylated 6-sulfo-LacNAc determinant was synthesized by established methods from three building blocks, a sialic acid donor (27Kuhn R. Kim P. MacDonald D.L. Chem.

The protective group at C-6 of GlcNAc was selectively removed and sulfated, followed by removal of all other protective groups, which gave the desired compound NeuAcα2-6Galβ1-4GlcNAcβ(6-O-sulfate)1-3Galβ1-4Glc-cholestanol: 500-MHz 1H NMR (CDCl3/CD3OD/D2O = 2:3:1, tetramethylsilane), δ 2.023 (s, 3H, NAc), 2.032 (s, 3H, NAc), 2.710 (dd, 1H, J3eq,4 = 4.4 Hz, J3eq,3ax = 12.0 Hz, H-3eeq), 3.250 (dd, 1H, J = 8.1, 9.0 Hz), 4.133 (d, 1H, J = 1.7 Hz), 4.244 (dd, 1H, J5,6 = 5.4 Hz, J6,6′ = 11.0 Hz, H-6c), 4.376 (bd, 1H, H-6′c), 4.414 (d, 2H, J1,2 = 7.6 Hz, H-1a, H-1b, H-1c, or H-1d), 4.450 (d, 1H, J1,2 = 7.8 Hz, H-1a, H-1b, H-1c, or H-1d), and 4.740 (d, 1H, J1,2 = 7.8 Hz, H-1a, H-1b, H-1c, or H-1d). An isomeric compound, NeuAcα2-3Galβ1-4GlcNAcβ(6-O-sulfate)1-3Galβ1-4Glc-cholestanol, was synthesized by similar methods, and the non-sialylated compound, Galβ1-4GlcNAcβ(6-O-sulfate)1-3Galβ1-4Glc-cholestanol, was prepared by sialidase A treatment. Synthetic sialyl paragloboside with an α2-6-sialic acid terminus (NeuAcα2-6Galβ1-4GlcNAcβ1-3Galβ1-4Glc-ceramide) was obtained from Wako Pure Chemicals (Osaka, Japan). CD22-mediated Cell Binding Assays—Recombinant human CD22-Fc was obtained from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN) and coated on the bottom of 24-well plates at a concentration of 20 μg/ml overnight at 4 °C. 2′,7′-bis(2-carboxyethyl)-5(6)-carboxyfluorescein acetoxymethyl ester (BCECF-AM)-labeled Namalwa cells (1 × 106/0.5 ml/well) were added, and the plate was placed on a rotating platform for incubation under shear (90 rpm) for 20 min at room temperature. Where indicated, the cells were preincubated with the inhibitor antibody (25 μg/ml) before addition to 24-well plates. After non-binding cells were washed out three times with phosphate-buffered saline, they were lysed with 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and the attached cells were counted by measuring fluorescence intensity using an Arvo 1420 multilabel counter (Wallac, Gaithersburg, MD). Recombinant human E-selectin-Fc (R&D Systems) served as a control for sulfate-independent binding. Monolayer cell adhesion experiments were performed as described previously (26Miyazaki K. Kim K.

SW480/HEC-GlcNAc6ST cells (expressing the α2-6-sialylated 6-sulfo-LacNAc determinant) and parental SW480 cells (expressing the non-sulfated α2-6-sialylated LacNAc determinant) were cultured in monolayer in 24-well plates. BCECF-AM-labeled Daudi cells expressing CD22 (1 × 106 cells/well) were added, and the plate was incubated for 20 min at room temperature. The adherent cells were lysed with 0.5% Nonidet P-40 and counted using the Arvo 1420 multilabel counter. In some experiments, Daudi or SW480/HEC-GlcNAc6ST cells were treated with sialidase or NaClO3 prior to adhesion experiments. Binding of recombinant CD22-Fc to human peripheral B-lymphocytes was ascertained by flow cytometric analyses as described previously (19Ohmori K. Kim K. Mitsuoka C. Kanamori A. Kurata-Miura K.

Recombinant CD22-Fc was preincubated with affinity-purified biotinylated rabbit anti-human IgG (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark), followed by incubation with phycoerythrin-streptavidin (Dako) before application to the staining of peripheral lymphocytes. BD FACS™ lysing solution was used for lysing red blood cells in the flow cytometric analyses. The cells were preincubated with blocking antibodies (KN343 and/or GL7; 20 μg/ml) for 30 min at 37 °C where indicated. Control murine and rat IgM reagents were obtained from BD Biosciences. Flow Cytometric Analysis and Immunohistochemical Examination of α2-6-Sialylated 6-Sulfated and Related Determinants—SW480 and transfectant cells were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (high glucose), and the Namalwa clone was maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. In some experiments, the cells were cultured in the presence of 40 mm NaClO3 for 7 days. Peripheral blood samples were obtained from healthy donors. The whole blood samples were mixed and incubated with anti-carbohydrate monoclonal antibody (purified antibody at 1 μg/ml or culture supernatant at a dilution of 1:10) at 4 °C for 30 min. The cells were then washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin and stained with a 1:200 dilution of fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgM (μ-chain specific; Chemicon International, Temecula, CA) at 4 °C for 30 min. After lysing red blood cells using BD FACS™ lysing solution, the stained cells were analyzed on a FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences). Leu4 (CD3) for T-cells, Leu12 (CD19) for B-cells, MY31 (Leu19, CD56) for natural killer cells, anti-CD45RA antibody HI100 (IgG2b), anti-CD45RO antibody UCHL1 (IgG2a), and anti-CD22 antibody SHCL-1 (IgG2b) were obtained from BD Biosciences for cell-surface marker analysis. Immunohistochemical staining of human lymphoid tissues was performed using frozen sections of 10-μm thickness prepared at autopsy at the Aichi Cancer Center Hospital. The avidin-biotin complex technique for immunohistochemical study was performed as described in the instructions for the respective kits for murine and rat IgM (VECTASTAIN) provided by Vector Laboratories (Burlingame, CA). The micrographs were recorded using a Microphot-FXA microscope system equipped with a DS-5M-L1 digital camera (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan), and images were processed using Adobe Photoshop Version 5.0J. Generation of Anti-α2-6-Sialylated 6-Sulfo-LacNAc Monoclonal Antibody KN343—As we did not have purified or synthetic α2-6-sialylated 6-sulfo-LacNAc for use as an immunogen for generation of monoclonal antibody at the initial stage of this study, we used human colon cancer cells (SW480) transfected with the gene for the GlcNAcβ:6-O-sulfotransferase HEC-GlcNAc6ST (SW480/HEC-GlcNAc6ST cells) as an immunogen. The obtained hybridoma clones were initially screened for their reactivity with SW480/HEC-GlcNAc6ST cells, but not with parental SW480 cells, to ascertain their 6-sulfation dependence (Fig. 1A). Antibodies G152 and G72, which we previously raised against 6-sulfated determinants carrying α2-3-sialylated termini, served as positive controls. The 6-sulfation-dependent clones were further subjected to a second screening using SW480/HEC-GlcNAc6ST cells treated with sialidase S (specific to the NeuAcα2-3 terminus) or sialidase A (cleaves NeuAcα2-3/6/8 termini). A KN343 (murine IgM) clone was selected because it reacted with sialidase S-treated cells but not with sialidase A-treated cells, which is compatible with its specificity for the NeuAcα2-6-linked terminus (Fig. 1B). Antibodies G152 and G72, which are specific to the 6-sulfated determinants carrying NeuAcα2-3-linked termini, which should not react with either sialidase S- or sialidase A-treated cells, served as controls for the experimental conditions. To ascertain the specificity of KN343 for the NeuAcα2-6-linked terminus, the cells were reacted with 2-6-sialyltransferase plus CMP-NeuAc after the sialidase A treatment. Antibody KN343 specifically reacted with the cells treated with 2-6-sialyltransferase plus CMP-NeuAc, but not with the those treated with 2-3-sialyltransferase plus CMP-NeuAc (Fig. 1B, lower two panels), indicating its specificity for the NeuAcα2-6-linked terminus. In contrast, antibody G152, which is specific to 6-sulfated determinants carrying NeuAcα2-3-linked termini, reacted only with the cells treated with α2-3-sialyltransferase plus CMP-NeuAc, but not with those treated with α2-6-sialyltransferase plus CMP-NeuAc. To ascertain the specificity of antibody KN343 for α2-6-sialylated 6-sulfated determinants, its reactivity was tested using organochemically synthesized pure carbohydrate determinants in ELISA. As shown in Fig. 1C, the antibody specifically reacted with the pure α2-6-sialylated 6-sulfo-LacNAc determinant, but hardly at all with the non-sulfated α2-6-sialylated LacNAc determinant. At high concentrations, only a weak cross-reactivity was noted with the non-sulfated α2-6-sialylated determinant. This was in clear contrast to the specificity of antibody GL7, which was shown quite recently to be specific to the α2-6-sialylated determinant (16Naito Y. Kim H. Koyama S. Miyake S. Yamamoto H. Fujinawa R. Sugai M. Okuno Y. Tsujimoto G. Yamaji T. Hashimoto Y. Itohara S. Kawasaki T. Suzuki A. Kozutsumi Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 3008-3022Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), reacting only with the non-sulfated α2-6-sialylated determinant and not with the α2-6-sialylated 6-sulfated determinant (Fig. 1C). These findings established that KN343 is a specific antibody for the α2-6-sialylated 6-sulfo LacNAc determinant at both the ELISA and cellular levels. Sulfated determinants often give false-positive results in ELISAs because of their strong negative electric charges, and it should be borne in mind that this antibody shows the same specificity also at the cellular level. Roles of Sulfate Residues in Carbohydrate Recognition by Recombinant CD22—A clone of Namalwa cells was found to most strongly express the α2-6-sialylated 6-sulfo-LacNAc determinant among the various cultured human B-lymphocyte lines we tested. The Namalwa clone did not express CD22 and was thought to be suitable for the cell binding assays using immobilized recombinant CD22. The Namalwa cells strongly bound to immobilized recombinant CD22, and this was almost completely abrogated by preincubating the cells with NaClO3, an inhibitor of cellular sulfate metabolism (Fig. 2A). This finding suggests a role for ligand sulfation in the binding of CD22. In line with this, the treatment abrogated expression of the α2-6-sialylated 6-sulfo-LacNAc determinant defined by antibody KN343, whereas expression of non-sulfated α2-6-sialylated determinants defined by antibody GL7 rather slightly increased by 36% in median fluorescence intensity (Fig. 2B). These findings strongly suggest the importance of sulfated α2-6-sialylated determinants in the binding of CD22 to Namalwa cells. Binding of the cells to recombinant CD22 was significantly inhibited by the addition of antibody KN343 to the assay system (Fig. 2C), confirming the involvement of the sulfated α2-6-sialylated determinants in CD22 binding. Roles of Sulfate Residues in Cell-Cell Adhesion Mediated by CD22—The roles of sulfate residues in glycan recognition by CD22 were further ascertained by monolayer cell adhesion assays. For this, Daudi cells strongly expressing CD22 (Fig. 3A) were employed for the adhesion experiments with parental SW480 or SW480/HEC-GlcNAc6ST cells. The sialidase-treated Daudi cells exhibited significant adhesion to SW480/HEC-GlcNAc6ST cells, which express the α2-6-sialylated 6-sulfo-LacNAc determinant, but did not adhere to parental SW480 cells, which do not express the determinant (Fig. 3B). The adhesion of Daudi cells was abrogated by sialidase or NaClO3 treatment of SW480/HEC-GlcNAc6ST cells (Fig. 3B) or by the addition of antibody KN343 (Fig. 3C). Antibody GL7 exhibited only marginal inhibition of cell adhesion, suggesting the important role of sulfated residues in the adhesion. It has been proposed that endogenous CD22 ligands mask the interaction of CD22 with trans-ligands (13Razi N. Kim A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7469-7474Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 35Hanasaki K. Kim A. Powell L.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7533-7542Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). As Daudi cells strongly express non-sulfated α2-6-sialylated determinants defined by GL7 as well as CD22 but only weakly express the α2-6-sialylated 6-sulfated determinants defined by KN343 (Fig. 3A), the cells were thought to be suitable for testing the role of endogenous sulfated ligands of CD22 on its interaction with trans-ligands expressed in SW480/HEC-GlcNAc6ST cells. As expected, sialidase treatment of Daudi cells markedly enhanced binding of the cells to SW480/HEC-GlcNAc6ST cells. The treatment of Daudi cells with 25 mm NaClO3 for 5 days was found to confer a similar enhancement of binding to SW480/HEC-GlcNAc6ST cells (Fig. 3D). The effects of NaClO3 and sialidase were not additive. These findings suggest that endogenous α2-6-sialylated 6-sulfated determinants in Daudi cells, although only weakly expressed, significantly mask the interaction of CD22 with trans-ligands. Distribution of the α2-6-Sialylated 6-Sulfo-LacNAc Determinant in Peripheral Blood Leukocytes—The α2-6-sialylated 6-sulfo-LacNAc determinant defined by antibody KN343 was expressed in subpopulations of lymphocytes, but was virtually undetectable in granulocytes and monocytes among normal human peripheral leukocytes (Fig. 4A). Granulocytes are known to express conventional non-sulfated α2-6-sialyl determinants (36Le Marer N. Kim P.O. J. Cell. Physiol. 1999; 179: 315-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), but our results suggest that they lack sulfated α2-6-sialyl determinants. Among lymphocyte subsets (Fig. 4B), the α2-6-sialylated 6-sulfo-LacNAc determinant was significantly expressed in CD19+ B-lymphocytes (53 ∼ 78%) and CD56+ natural killer cells (41 ∼ 70%), but only weakly in CD3+ T-lymphocytes (4 ∼ 6%). This was in clear contrast to the distribution of the α2-3-sialyl-6-sulfated determinants we characterized previously (34Ohmori K. Kim F. Kiso M. Imai T. Yoshie O. Hasegawa H. Matsushima K. Kannagi R. Blood. 2006; 107: 3197-3204Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), which are preferentially expressed in CD3+CD4+CD45RO+ helper memory T-lymphocytes and CD56+ natural killer cells, but virtually never in CD19+ B-lymphocytes. The non-sulfated α2-6-sialyl-LacNAc determinant defined by antibody GL7 was homogeneously expressed in virtually all CD19+ B-lymphocytes. Recombinant CD22-Fc was found to bind to CD19+ B-lymphocytes. The binding was significantly inhibited by the addition of antibody KN343, but was hardly inhibited by antibody GL7 (Fig. 4C). The inhibitory effect of the simultaneous addition of antibodies KN343 and GL7 was not much different from that exerted by antibody KN343 alone (Fig. 4C). These findings again corroborate the importance of the α2-6-sialylated 6-sulfo-LacNAc determinant as the ligand for CD22. Distribution of the α2-6-Sialylated 6-Sulfo-LacNAc Determinant in Human Lymphoid Tissues—In peripheral lymph nodes, the α2-6-sialylated 6-sulfo-LacNAc determinant was expressed in follicular B-lymphocytes (Fig. 5). The distribution pattern was similar to that of non-sulfated α2-6-sialyl determinants defined by GL7 (Fig. 5, A and B). The difference between sulfated and non-sulfated determinants was that the germinal center B-lymphocytes almost completely lacked the sulfated determinants (Fig. 5A), but weakly expressed the non-sulfated determinants (Fig. 5B). The most striking difference between sulfated and non-sulfated α2-6-sialyl determinants in peripheral lymphoid tissues was that the sulfated determinants were strongly expressed in high endothelial venules (HEVs), whereas the non-sulfated determinants were not detectable (Fig. 5, A and B). HEVs in tonsils as well as in intestine-associated lymphoid tissues also strongly expressed the α2-6-sialylated 6-sulfo-LacNAc determinant (Fig. 5, C and D), whereas blood vessels in the spleen and thymus did not express the determinants (E and F). Human CD22/Siglec-2 has been known to specifically recognize α2-6-sialylated glycans. The reactivity of CD22 with α2-6-sialylated and 6-sulfated glycans was first noted in the printed covalent glycan microarray technique using synthetic oligosaccharide and recombinant CD22-Fc protein by Blixt et al. (18Blixt O. Kim S. Mondala T. Scanlan C. Huflejt M.E. Alvarez R. Bryan M.C. Fazio F. Calarese D. Stevens J. Razi N. Stevens D.J. Skehel J.J. van Die I. Burton D.R. Wilson I.A. Cummings R. Bovin N. Wong C.H. Paulson J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 17033-17038Crossref PubMed Scopus (968) Google Scholar). Our results indicate that α2-6-sialylated 6-sulfated LacNAc determinants are really expressed in situ on human B-lymphocytes in peripheral blood as well as in lymphoid tissues such as peripheral lymph nodes and can confer significant binding of CD22 at the cellular level. Previous glycan array assays (18Blixt O. Kim S. Mondala T. Scanlan C. Huflejt M.E. Alvarez R. Bryan M.C. Fazio F. Calarese D. Stevens J. Razi N. Stevens D.J. Skehel J.J. van Die I. Burton D.R.

A. 2004; 101: 17033-17038Crossref PubMed Scopus (968) Google Scholar) indicated that additional 6-GlcNAc sulfation of α2-6-sialylated glycan enhances CD22 binding relative to the corresponding non-sulfated glycan and suggested that α2-6-sialylated and 6-sulfated LacNAc glycan could be a preferred high affinity ligand for human CD22 (10Crocker P.R. Curr. Opin. Pharmacol. 2005; 5: 431-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 18Blixt O. Kim S. Mondala T. Scanlan C. Huflejt M.E. Alvarez R. Bryan M.C. Fazio F. Calarese D. Stevens J. Razi N.

A. 2004; 101: 17033-17038Crossref PubMed Scopus (968) Google Scholar). In line with this, our results indicate the importance of 6-GlcNAc sulfation because NaClO3 treatment of the cells, which resulted in loss of 6-GlcNAc sulfation but retained α2-6-sialylation, almost totally abrogated binding to CD22. The strong inhibition of CD22 binding with antibody specific to the α2-6-sialylated 6-sulfated LacNAc determinant also serves to corroborate that additional 6-GlcNAc sulfation significantly enhances CD22 binding. Endogenous CD22/Siglec-2 ligands present on B-lymphocytes are known to be α2-6-sialylated glycans, which mask the CD22 interaction with trans-ligands. Our results suggest that the α2-6-sialylated 6-sulfated LacNAc determinant can also serve as a cis-ligand for endogenous CD22 and participate in the masking. It has long been assumed that α2-6-sialyltransferases such as β-galactoside α2-6-sialyltransferase-1 (ST6Gal-1) regulate expression of CD22 ligands and therefore regulate the masking and unmasking of CD22/Siglec-2. Recently, however, it was shown that N-glycolylation of sialic acid by CMP-NeuAc hydroxylase significantly affects CD22 ligand activity in murine system, as glycans carrying NeuGcα2-6 termini are much preferred ligands for murine CD22 compared with glycans carrying NeuAcα2-6 termini (16Naito Y. Kim H. Koyama S. Miyake S. Yamamoto H. Fujinawa R. Sugai M. Okuno Y. Tsujimoto G. Yamaji T. Hashimoto Y. Itohara S. Kawasaki T. Suzuki A. Kozutsumi Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 3008-3022Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Because humans have no NeuGc due to deletion of exons in the CMP-NeuAc hydroxylase gene (37Chou H.H. Kim H. Diaz S. Iber J. Nickerson E. Wright K.L. Muchmore E.A. Nelson D.L. Warren S.T. Varki A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11751-11756Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar, 38Irie A. Kim S. Kozutsumi Y.

Instead, our results suggest a role for 6-O-sulfotransferases, which are known to be affected by various stimuli and depend on cellular activation status (34Ohmori K. Kim F. Kiso M. Imai T. Yoshie O.

An unexpected finding of this study is that the α2-6-sialylated and 6-sulfated LacNAc determinant is strongly expressed in HEVs in lymphoid tissues, including peripheral lymph nodes, tonsils, and intestine-associated lymphoid tissues. Endothelial expression of the determinant seems to be HEV-specific because endothelial cells lining the blood vessels in the spleen and thymus did not express the determinant. Expression of the determinant in HEVs was much stronger than that in B-lymphocytes, judging from the results of immunohistochemical staining. This is not unusual given that 6-O-sulfotransferases HEC-GlcNAc6ST and GlcNAc6ST-1 are strongly expressed in HEVs (23Bistrup A. Kim S. Lee J.K. Belov Y.Y. Gunn M.D. Zuo F.R. Huang C.C. Kannagi R.

Our results thus suggest that these two 6-O-sulfotransferases also synthesize the α2-6-sialylated 6-sulfo-LacNAc determinant in HEVs. The physiological functions for the endothelial CD22 ligands remain to be clarified. It has long been suggested that CD22 may be involved in B-lymphocyte trafficking and homing, including that to the bone marrow (6Nitschke L. Kim H. Ferguson D.J. Crocker P.R. J. Exp.

The strong expression of the CD22 ligand α2-6-sialylated 6-sulfated LacNAc determinant in HEVs suggests its involvement in the homing and recruitment of peripheral B-lymphocytes."

Thus, the present data denote Hsp90-Cdc37 as a transiently acting essential regulatory component of IKK signaling. NF-κB maintains key functions in various biological and pathological processes, including immune and inflammatory reactions, development, proliferation, apoptosis, stress responses, and oncogenesis (1Hayden M.S.

In the first, canonical pathway, a broad range of extracellular stimuli, including bacterial pathogens, antigens, mitogens, and inflammatory cytokines, induce diverse intracellular cascades, which activate the IκB kinase (IKK) 4The abbreviations used are: IKK, IκB kinase; UbK63, Lys-63-linked polyubiquitination; FKBP51, FK506-binding protein 51; GA, geldanamycin; siRNA, small interfering RNA; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; TNFα, tumor necrosis factor α; IP, immunoprecipitation.4The abbreviations used are: IKK, IκB kinase; UbK63, Lys-63-linked polyubiquitination; FKBP51, FK506-binding protein 51; GA, geldanamycin; siRNA, small interfering RNA; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; TNFα, tumor necrosis factor α; IP, immunoprecipitation. complex. IKK-mediated phosphorylation triggers IκB and p105 polyubiquitination by the SCFβTrCP E3 ligase complex and subsequent proteasomal destruction, resulting in the release of p50-, p65-, and c-Rel-containing heterodimers (1Hayden M.S.

With much slower kinetics, a second, noncanonical NF-κB pathway induces C-terminal processing of NF-κB2/p100 to generate p52-containing complexes (5Bonizzi G. Kim M. Trends Immunol. 2004; 25: 280-288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2055) Google Scholar). Finally, a “nuclear-to-cytoplasmic” pathway promotes NF-κB activation in response to DNA damage (6Janssens S. Kim J. Cell Death Differ. 2006; 13: 773-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar).The IKK complex has a large apparent molecular mass of 700-900 kDa and contains the kinases IKKα and IKKβ as well as the regulatory nonenzymatic scaffold protein IKKγ, also known as NEMO (NF-κB essential modifier) (1Hayden M.S. Kim S. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 2195-2224Crossref PubMed Scopus (3332) Google Scholar, 7Scheidereit C. Oncogene. 2006; 25: 6685-6705Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar).

Science. 2004; 304: 1963-1967Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). IKK activation is dependent on phosphorylation at activation loop (T-loop) serines, either by upstream IKK kinases or by autophosphorylation. The activation process involves catalytic, nondestructive Lys-63-linked polyubiquitination (UbK63) of IKKγ as well as UbK63 binding by IKKγ (12Ea C.K. Kim L. Xia Z.P. Pineda G. Chen Z.J. Mol.

A number of regulatory proteins have been suggested to interact with IKK components (reviewed in Refs. 1Hayden M.S. Kim S.

Hsp90 promotes their proper folding, assembly, and transportation across different cellular compartments (18Richter K. Kim J. J. Cell. Physiol. 2001; 188: 281-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar, 19Pearl L.H. Kim C. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2000; 10: 46-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar, 20Picard D. Cell Mol.

Hsp90 is regulated through sequential and cooperative binding of a set of co-chaperones that link Hsp90 to distinct classes of client proteins. The mammalian homologue of the budding yeast cell cycle control protein Cdc37 is one such co-chaperone (22MacLean M. Kim D.

The immunophilin FK506-binding protein 51 (FKBP51), also suggested as a regulator of NF-κB activity (24Bouwmeester T. Kim A. Ruffner H. Angrand P.O. Bergamini G. Croughton K. Cruciat C. Eberhard D.

Hence, it is unclear to what extent Hsp90 inhibition affects NF-κB pathways at the level of IKK versus that of upstream kinases and if chaperones control the signaling process per se or have homeostatic functions.In the present study, we investigated how Hsp90 and Cdc37 interact with the IKK signalosome, utilizing RNA interference. With a compositional analysis, we demonstrate that the IKKα, -β, and -γ core complex is not associated with additional stoichiometric subunits. Cdc37 recruits Hsp90 to the IKK complex in a transitory manner, preferentially via IKKα, and is phosphorylated by both IKKα and IKKβ. Interaction with the chaperone complex is essential to promote functional maturation of de novo synthesized IκB kinases. Moreover, Hsp90-Cdc37 activity is required to trigger catalytic activation of T-loop phosphorylated IKKs following stimulation with TNF-α or DNA damage. These results provide evidence that the chaperone complex acts on the IKK complex in the process of its activation.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Culture and Transfection—HeLa and 293 cells were grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (PAA Laboratories), supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, and 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin. 17-Demethoxy geldanamycin was purchased from InvivoGen. 293 cells were transiently transfected by calcium phosphate precipitation using standard protocols. HeLa cells were transfected with DNA constructs using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Synthetic siRNAs were transfected in final concentrations between 0.5 and 10 nm. Lipid-mediated transfection was carried out with atufect01 (36Santel A. Kim M. Keil O. Endruschat J. Esche V. Fisch G. Dames S. Loffler K. Fechtner M. Arnold W. Giese K. Klippel A. Kaufmann J.

Where indicated, cells were additionally transfected with DNA constructs 48 h after siRNA transfection using Lipofectamine 2000. Cells were lysed 72 h after siRNA transfection. Full-length human IKKα, IKKβ, and IKKγ cDNAs were cloned with N-terminal FLAG epitope into pcDNA3 or with N-terminal Myc epitope into pRK5. Kinase-dead mutants of IKKα and IKKβ carry a K44A mutation (37Woronicz J.D. Kim X. Cao Z. Rothe M. Goeddel D.V. Science. 1997; 278: 866-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (1063) Google Scholar). N-terminally FLAG-tagged full-length, truncated, or point-mutated human Cdc37 was cloned into pcDNA3.Immunoprecipitation, Western Blotting, Kinase Assay, and Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—Immunoprecipitations and Western blots were performed in accordance with standard procedures. Cells were lysed in 100 mm NaCl, 25 mm Tris, pH 8, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, supplemented with complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science), 10 mm NaF, 8 mm β-glycerophosphate, 0,2 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm dithiothreitol. For antibodies, see the supplemental data. Kinase assays and electrophoretic mobility shift assays were performed as described previously (38Krappmann D. Kim F. Kordes U. Scharschmidt E. Dorken B.

Intensities of signals for IκBα protein (Western blots), phosphorylated GST-IκBα (kinase assays), and NF-κB-DNA complexes (EMSA) were quantified with TINA version 2.0.Reporter Gene Assay—293 cells were transfected in a 6-well plate with 0.25 μg of pRL-TK (Promega), 3 ng of 6× NF-κB-luc (39Bergmann M. Kim L. Lindsay M. Barnes P.J. Newton R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6607-6610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), and 2.5 μg of pCDNA3. Where indicated, 0.8 μg of Cdc37 expression construct and 0.7 μg of FLAG-IKKβ was transfected together with pcDNA3 vector up to 2.5 μg. 24 h post-transfection, the cells were stimulated with 40 ng/ml TNFα for 4 h, as indicated, and luciferase activity was determined using a dual luciferase assay kit (Promega).Gel Filtration—∼2 × 107 HeLa cells were lysed in a 500-μl volume of 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm NaF, 8 mm β-glycerophosphate, 0.1 mm orthovanadate, 10% glycerol plus complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science).

Extracts were precleared with protein A-Sepharose for 1 h and incubated with anti-IKKγ antibodies overnight at 4 °C. Finally, protein A-Sepharose was added for 3 h. Precipitates were washed five times with lysis buffer and boiled SDS loading buffer. The supernatant was applied on a SDS-PAGE and analyzed by autoradiography.RESULTSHsp90-Cdc37 Interacts with the Core IKK Complex in a Transitory Manner—To determine the role of Hsp90 and Cdc37 in IKK signaling, we analyzed the mode of their association with the IKK holocomplex. IKKγ and IKKα precipitation from lysates of [35S]methionine-labeled HeLa cells revealed only three prominent interacting species (Fig. 1A). Silencing of single IKK components with specific siRNAs verified the observed species as IKKα, IKKβ, and IKKγ (Fig. 1B). In contrast, silencing of Cdc37 or FKBP51, suggested as stoichiometric components (Hsp90-Cdc37) or regulatory co-factor (FKBP51) of the IKK complex (14Chen G. Kim P. Goeddel D.V. Mol.

IKKα, IKKβ, and IKKγ were identically eluted in fractions 12-16 with a peak in fraction 14 (Fig. 1C) with an apparent molecular mass between 700 and 900 kDa, as described before (8Krappmann D. Kim E.N. Tegethoff S. Li J. Klippel A. Giese K. Baeuerle P.A. Scheidereit C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29779-29787Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 40Yamaoka S.

Natoli G. Karin M. Nature. 1998; 395: 297-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (842) Google Scholar). Upon gel filtration, Hsp90 (fractions 18-22), Cdc37 (fractions 24-28), and FKBP51 (fractions 22-26) eluted with distinct smaller sizes compared with the IKK complex (Fig. 1C). Moreover, TNFα stimulation did not change this gel filtration profile of Cdc37 and Hsp90 (Fig. S1). Because small amounts of Cdc37 and Hsp90 trailed into the IKK fractions, a stoichiometric contribution of Cdc37 and Hsp90 to the IKK complex could still be possible if Cdc37 and Hsp90 were present in high molar excess over the IKK components. However, quantification of the molar ratio of the endogenous proteins indicated only a roughly 2-3-fold molar excess of Cdc37 over IKKβ (Fig. S2). These data reveal that only a small fraction of cellular IKK complexes interacts with Cdc37 and Hsp90 at a given time, considering that Hsp90 is largely recruited to IKKs via Cdc37 (see below). Surprisingly, our data gave no indication that the previously proposed essential subunit ELKS (105 kDa) (11Ducut Sigala J.L. Kim V. Young D.B. Shevchenko A. Mercurio F. Verma I.M. Science. 2004; 304: 1963-1967Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar) is part of the IKK complex (Fig. 1, A-C). In fact, further investigations, addressing IKK binding and NF-κB activation (data not shown), could not support ELKS as an essential, generally associated regulatory subunit of the IKK complex.As expected for a stoichiometric component, silencing of IKKα (in contrast to ELKS, Cdc37, or FKBP51) caused a clearly discernible decrease of the apparent size of the residual IKKγ-containing complex (Fig. 1D), indicating a different structure or oligomeric composition. The siRNA-mediated knockdown of indicated proteins (Fig. 1, B and D) was controlled by Western blotting (Fig. 1E). Taken together, we conclude that the chaperones are not stable stoichiometric components of the IKK complex but rather associate transiently.Cdc37 Preferentially Interacts with IKKα to Recruit Hsp90 and FKBP51 to the IKK Complex—Although the importance of Hsp90 for IKK activation pathways seems unambiguous, it is not understood how the chaperone complex interacts with the IKK complex. Previous studies, using ectopically expressed IKK deletion mutants and GST pull-down assays, indicated that Cdc37-Hsp90 complexes bind to the kinase domains of IKKα and -β (14Chen G. Kim P. Goeddel D.V. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 401-410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). Indeed, both Cdc37 and Hsp90 were co-precipitated with anti-IKKγ antibodies, indicating association with the endogenous IKK complex (Fig. 2A). Silencing of Cdc37 expression disrupted binding of Hsp90 to IKKs. Residual Hsp90 may reflect incomplete Cdc37 depletion. Notably, loss of IKKα but not IKKβ interfered with Hsp90-Cdc37 recruitment, suggesting that preferentially IKKα bridges Cdc37 and Hsp90 to the IKK complex. Protein interaction studies in cells transiently expressing FLAG-tagged Cdc37 together with Myc-tagged IKKα and Myc-IKKβ confirmed the highly preferential binding of Cdc37 to IKKα (Fig. 2B). Remarkably, a kinase domain mutant (K44A) of both IKKs bound with much higher affinity to Cdc37 compared with wild type (Fig. 2B), suggesting that structural alterations of the kinase domain influence Cdc37 interaction. A double band of Cdc37 was detected when cotransfected with wild type IKKs, suggesting IKK-dependent phosphorylation. Further examination revealed that FLAG-Cdc37 was phosphorylated at serine 300 by ectopically expressed IKKs (Fig. S3, A-C), in turn confirming that Cdc37 interacts with both IKKs. Moreover, TNFα-stimulated endogenous IKK complexes phosphorylated Cdc37 in an in vitro kinase assay (Fig. S3D). Future analyses will be important to clarify the physiological function of IKK-dependent phosphorylation of Cdc37.FIGURE 2Cdc37 preferentially binds to IKKα and connects Hsp90 and FKBP51 to the IKK complex. A, HeLa cells were transfected with siRNA against the indicated proteins. The IKK complex was precipitated with an IKKγ antibody, and co-immunoprecipitation of Hsp90 and Cdc37 was analyzed by Western blotting. Equal amounts of cell extracts (Input) were immunoblotted to determine protein expression levels. B, 293 cells were transfected with FLAG-Cdc37 and different Myc-IKK constructs as indicated. K/A, kinase-inactive K44A mutant. Lysates were precipitated with FLAG antibody. Precipitates were analyzed for Myc-IKK, Hsp90, and FLAG-Cdc37 by Western blotting. Expression levels in the lysates were also determined (Input). C, HeLa cells were transfected with the indicated siRNAs, and lysates were precipitated with an IKKγ antibody. Co-immunoprecipitation of FKBP51 was analyzed by Western blotting. Cell extracts (Input) were immunoblotted to determine expression levels of IKKα, IKKβ, and Cdc37. The specific band for FKBP51 is marked by an asterisk. D, 293 cells were transfected with FLAG-Cdc37 wild type (WT) or deletion constructs along with Myc-IKKα.

Kim A. Ruffner H. Angrand P.O. Bergamini G. Croughton K. Cruciat C. Eberhard D. Gagneur J. Ghidelli S. Hopf C. Huhse B. Mangano R. Michon A.M. Schirle M. Schlegl J. Schwab M. Stein M.A. Bauer A.

Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 97-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (851) Google Scholar), also co-precipitates with endogenous IKK complexes (Fig. 2C). As observed for Hsp90, down-modulation of either Cdc37 or IKKα disrupted its binding. Thus, given that FKBP51 is a known Hsp90 binding partner (18Richter K. Kim J. J. Cell. Physiol. 2001; 188: 281-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar, 25Riggs D.L. Kim M.B. Cheung-Flynn J. Prapapanich V. Carrigan P.E. Smith D.F. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2004; 39: 279-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), its recruitment to the IKK complex is indirect through Hsp90, Cdc37, and IKKα. At present, the function of FKBP51 for IKK signaling is unclear, since down-modulation of FKBP51 interfered with neither TNFα-induced IKK activity nor IκBα degradation and p65 translocation (data not shown).To investigate the mode of Hsp90-Cdc37-IKKα interaction in more detail, we transiently expressed FLAG-tagged Cdc37 mutant constructs together with Myc-tagged IKKα. In co-immunoprecipitation studies, all deletion mutants were defective in Hsp90 association (Fig. 2D). Surprisingly, N-terminal (ΔN) as well as C-terminal deletion mutants (ΔC1, ΔC2) could efficiently bind to IKKα, indicating two independent IKKα binding sites on Cdc37 (Fig. 2D). One of these seems to be located in a central region of Cdc37, since binding of ΔC1 to IKKα was diminished. In sum, these data confirm Cdc37 as an adaptor between Hsp90 and IKKα.Strict Requirement of Hsp90-Cdc37 for Activation of Ectopically Expressed IκB Kinases—To define the functional role of Hsp90 and Cdc37 for the IKK activation process, we directly manipulated Hsp90 and Cdc37 levels in cells. Co-transfection of IKKβ together with Cdc37 robustly increased NF-κB-dependent transcription (Fig. 3A). Moreover, Cdc37 amplified activation loop phosphorylation of Myc-IKKα or IKKβ (Fig. 3B). In turn, silencing of endogenous Cdc37 abolished T-loop phosphorylation and kinase activity of transfected IKKβ without affecting IKK expression levels (Fig. 3C). Down-modulation of Hsp90α and Hsp90β likewise resulted in reduced kinase activity, but to a minor extent, due to incomplete knockdown (data not shown).FIGURE 3Ectopically expressed IKKs require Hsp90-Cdc37 for kinase activity. A, 293 cells were transfected either with empty vector or expression vector for Cdc37, together with 6×NF-κB-luc and pRLTK as an internal standard. Cells were either co-transfected with IKKβ expression vector or stimulated with TNFα, and NF-κB activation was measured in a luciferase reporter assay. Shown is a representative of three independent experiments. B, 293 cells were transfected with expression vectors for FLAG-Cdc37 and Myc-IKKα or Myc-IKKβ. The activation loop phosphorylation of Myc-IKKs was detected by immunoblotting with a phosphospecific IKK antibody. Expression levels of ectopically expressed proteins were controlled with their respective antibodies. C, HeLa cells were first transfected with siRNAs against the indicated proteins and 48 h later with FLAG-IKKβ. Lysates were immunoprecipitated with FLAG antibody, and kinase activity was determined in an in vitro kinase assay. IKK activation loop phosphorylation, FLAG-IKKβ expression, and down-modulation of Cdc37 and IKKα protein levels were analyzed by Western blotting.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Ectopically expressed IKKs respond in a much more sensitive manner to modulation of Cdc37 expression than preformed cellular IKK complexes in TNFα-induced cells, as judged by luciferase reporter (Fig. 3A) and kinase assays (Fig. S4). Taken together, these observations strongly suggest that newly synthesized IKKs require Hsp90-Cdc37 to achieve an inducible conformation.Cdc37 Is Required for the Formation of Functionally Competent Endogenous de Novo Synthesized IKKs—The fact that Hsp90-Cdc37 mediates maturation of ectopically expressed IKKs into a catalytically competent conformation alludes to similar functions for de novo synthesized endogenous IKKs. Thus, we analyzed Hsp90-Cdc37-dependent IKK activity in a situation where the role of"
https://openalex.org/W2084285861,"Social insects rely heavily on pheromone communication to maintain their sociality. Egg protection is one of the most fundamental social behaviours in social insects. The recent discovery of the termite-egg mimicking fungus 'termite-ball' and subsequent studies on termite egg protection behaviour have shown that termites can be manipulated by using the termite egg recognition pheromone (TERP), which strongly evokes the egg-carrying and -grooming behaviours of workers. Despite the great scientific and economic importance, TERP has not been identified because of practical difficulties. Herein we identified the antibacterial protein lysozyme as the TERP. We isolated the target protein using ion-exchange and hydrophobic interaction chromatography, and the MALDI-TOF MS analysis showed a molecular size of 14.5 kDa. We found that the TERP provided antibacterial activity against a gram-positive bacterium. Among the currently known antimicrobial proteins, the molecular size of 14.5 kDa limits the target to lysozyme. Termite lysozymes obtained from eggs and salivary glands, and even hen egg lysozyme, showed a strong termite egg recognition activity. Besides eggs themselves, workers also supply lysozyme to eggs through frequent egg-grooming, by which egg surfaces are coated with saliva containing lysozyme. Reverse transcript PCR analysis showed that mRNA of termite lysozyme was expressed in both salivary glands and eggs. Western blot analysis confirmed that lysozyme production begins in immature eggs in queen ovaries. This is the first identification of proteinaceous pheromone in social insects. Researchers have focused almost exclusively on hydrocarbons when searching for recognition pheromones in social insects. The present finding of a proteinaceous pheromone represents a major step forward in, and result in the broadening of, the search for recognition pheromones. This novel function of lysozyme as a termite pheromone illuminates the profound influence of pathogenic microbes on the evolution of social behaviour in termites."
https://openalex.org/W2027079710,"Virulence does not represent any obvious advantage to parasites. Most models of virulence evolution assume that virulence is an unavoidable consequence of within-host multiplication of parasites, resulting in trade-offs between within-host multiplication and between-host transmission fitness components. Experimental support for the central assumption of this hypothesis, i.e., for a positive correlation between within-host multiplication rates and virulence, is limited for plant-parasite systems.We have addressed this issue in the system Arabidopsis thaliana-Cucumber mosaic virus (CMV). Virus multiplication and the effect of infection on plant growth and on viable seed production were quantified for 21 Arabidopsis wild genotypes infected by 3 CMV isolates. The effect of infection on plant growth and seed production depended of plant architecture and length of postembryonic life cycle, two genetically-determined traits, as well as on the time of infection in the plant's life cycle. A relationship between virus multiplication and virulence was not a general feature of this host-parasite system. This could be explained by tolerance mechanisms determined by the host genotype and operating differently on two components of plant fitness, biomass production and resource allocation to seeds. However, a positive relationship between virus multiplication and virulence was detected for some accessions with short life cycle and high seed weight to biomass ratio, which show lower levels of tolerance to infection.These results show that genotype-specific tolerance mechanisms may lead to the absence of a clear relationship between parasite multiplication and virulence. Furthermore, a positive correlation between parasite multiplication and virulence may occur only in some genotypes and/or environmental conditions for a given host-parasite system. Thus, our results challenge the general validity of the trade-off hypothesis for virulence evolution, and stress the need of considering the effect of both the host and parasite genotypes in analyses of host-parasite interactions."
https://openalex.org/W1970278963,"Induction of expression of the tumor suppressor p53 after interferon treatment has been recently demonstrated (Takaoka et al., 2003), suggesting an antiviral activity of the protein. In addition, a direct correlation between p53 levels and tumor resistance has been addressed by generating mice with an extra copy of p53 ('super p53' mice) (Garcia-Cao et al., 2002). Here, we show that vesicular stomatitis virus replication in mouse embryo fibroblasts derived from 'super p53' mice is impaired as a result of apoptosis induction via p53 activation. These findings unequivocally demonstrate an antiviral activity of p53, a process that may contribute to inhibit the spread of the virus in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2008696865,"microRNAs (miRNAs) are approximately 21 nucleotide non-coding transcripts capable of regulating gene expression. The most widely studied mechanism of regulation involves binding of a miRNA to the target mRNA. As a result, translation of the target mRNA is inhibited and the mRNA may be destabilized. The inhibitory effects of miRNAs have been linked to diverse cellular processes including malignant proliferation, apoptosis, development, differentiation, and metabolic processes. We asked whether endogenous fluctuations in a set of mRNA and miRNA profiles contain correlated changes that are statistically distinguishable from the many other fluctuations in the data set.RNA was extracted from 12 human primary brain tumor biopsies. These samples were used to determine genome-wide mRNA expression levels by microarray analysis and a miRNA profile by real-time reverse transcription PCR. Correlation coefficients were determined for all possible mRNA-miRNA pairs and the distribution of these correlations compared to the random distribution. An excess of high positive and negative correlation pairs were observed at the tails of these distributions. Most of these highest correlation pairs do not contain sufficiently complementary sequences to predict a target relationship; nor do they lie in physical proximity to each other. However, by examining pairs in which the significance of the correlation coefficients is modestly relaxed, negative correlations do tend to predict targets and positive correlations tend to predict physically proximate pairs. A subset of high correlation pairs were experimentally validated by over-expressing or suppressing a miRNA and measuring the correlated mRNAs.Sufficient information exists within a set of tumor samples to detect endogenous correlations between miRNA and mRNA levels. Based on the validations the causal arrow for these correlations is likely to be directed from the miRNAs to the mRNAs. From these data sets, we inferred and validated a tumor suppression pathway linked to miR-181c."
https://openalex.org/W1969936661,"WHITE COLLAR-1 (WC-1) mediates interactions between the circadian clock and the environment by acting as both a core clock component and as a blue light photoreceptor in Neurospora crassa. Loss of the amino-terminal polyglutamine (NpolyQ) domain in WC-1 results in an arrhythmic circadian clock; this data is consistent with this simple sequence repeat (SSR) being essential for clock function.Since SSRs are often polymorphic in length across natural populations, we reasoned that investigating natural variation of the WC-1 NpolyQ may provide insight into its role in the circadian clock. We observed significant phenotypic variation in the period, phase and temperature compensation of circadian regulated asexual conidiation across 143 N. crassa accessions. In addition to the NpolyQ, we identified two other simple sequence repeats in WC-1. The sizes of all three WC-1 SSRs correlated with polymorphisms in other clock genes, latitude and circadian period length. Furthermore, in a cross between two N. crassa accessions, the WC-1 NpolyQ co-segregated with period length.Natural variation of the WC-1 NpolyQ suggests a mechanism by which period length can be varied and selected for by the local environment that does not deleteriously affect WC-1 activity. Understanding natural variation in the N.crassa circadian clock will facilitate an understanding of how fungi exploit their environments."
https://openalex.org/W2108507302,"Transcription factors (TF) regulate expression by binding to specific DNA sequences. A binding event is functional when it affects gene expression. Functionality of a binding site is reflected in conservation of the binding sequence during evolution and in over represented binding in gene groups with coherent biological functions. Functionality is governed by several parameters such as the TF-DNA binding strength, distance of the binding site from the transcription start site (TSS), DNA packing, and more. Understanding how these parameters control functionality of different TFs in different biological contexts is a must for identifying functional TF binding sites and for understanding regulation of transcription.We introduce a novel method to screen the promoters of a set of genes with shared biological function (obtained from the functional Gene Ontology (GO) classification) against a precompiled library of motifs, and find those motifs which are statistically over-represented in the gene set. More than 8,000 human (and 23,000 mouse) genes, were assigned to one of 134 GO sets. Their promoters were searched (from 200 bp downstream to 1,000 bp upstream the TSS) for 414 known DNA motifs. We optimized the sequence similarity score threshold, independently for every location window, taking into account nucleotide heterogeneity along the promoters of the target genes. The method, combined with binding sequence and location conservation between human and mouse, identifies with high probability functional binding sites for groups of functionally-related genes. We found many location-sensitive functional binding events and showed that they clustered close to the TSS. Our method and findings were tested experimentally.We identified reliably functional TF binding sites. This is an essential step towards constructing regulatory networks. The promoter region proximal to the TSS is of central importance for regulation of transcription in human and mouse, just as it is in bacteria and yeast."
https://openalex.org/W1972209970,"Pathological cardiac hypertrophy is associated with an increased risk of heart failure and cardiovascular mortality. Calcium (Ca(2+)) -regulated gene expression is essential for the induction of hypertrophy, but it is not known how myocytes distinguish between the Ca(2+) signals that regulate contraction and those that lead to cardiac hypertrophy. We used in vitro neonatal rat ventricular myocytes to perform an RNA interference (RNAi) screen for ion channels that mediate Ca(2+)-dependent gene expression in response to hypertrophic stimuli. We identified several ion channels that are linked to hypertrophic gene expression, including transient receptor potential C3 (TrpC3). RNAi-mediated knockdown of TrpC3 decreases expression of hypertrophy-associated genes such as the A- and B-type natriuretic peptides (ANP and BNP) in response to numerous hypertrophic stimuli, while TrpC3 overexpression increases BNP expression. Furthermore, stimuli that induce hypertrophy dramatically increase TrpC3 mRNA levels. Importantly, whereas TrpC3-knockdown strongly reduces gene expression associated with hypertrophy, it has a negligible effect on cell size and on myocyte beating. These results suggest that Ca(2+) influx through TrpC3 channels increases transcription of genes associated with hypertrophy but does not regulate the signaling pathways that control cell size or contraction. Thus TrpC3 may represent an important therapeutic target for the treatment of cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure."
https://openalex.org/W2032556771,"Previous studies have yielded conflicting results regarding the ability of microbial products to activate TLR2 gene expression in human monocytes. In this study, we found that TLR2 mRNA was rapidly up-regulated in human monocytes treated with TLR2 and TLR4 agonists, and this corresponded to an increase in cell surface receptor levels. This induction was abrogated by actinomycin D as well as a pharmacologic inhibitor of NF-κB, suggesting that the TLR2 gene is transcriptionally activated via NF-κB. Microbial agonists were found to shift the transcription initiation site of the TLR2 gene, and sequence examination revealed a near-consensus NF-κB-binding element immediately upstream of this site. Electromobility shift assays confirmed that NF-κB bound to this putative site in vitro. However, luciferase reporter plasmids driven by the TLR2 promoter were not responsive to TLR2 agonists. Overexpression of the NF-κB p65 subunit was sufficient to induce expression of the endogenous TLR2 mRNA, and co-transfection of the CREB-binding protein and p300 co-activators further increased TLR2 mRNA levels. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis revealed that p65, CREB-binding protein, and p300 are recruited to the TLR2 promoter upon stimulation of human monocytes followed by histone hyperacetylation.

Through direct recognition of conserved microbial products, TLRs enable the host immune system to sense the presence of microbes and initiate appropriate protective responses (1Akira S. Kim S. Takeuchi O. Cell. 2006; 124: 783-801Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8895) Google Scholar). Upon ligation, TLRs initiate cytoplasmic signaling pathways leading to the activation of transcription factors that induce pro-inflammatory mediators. Examples of TLR agonists include lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from Gram-negative bacteria (TLR4), bacterial flagellin (TLR5), unmethylated CpG-rich bacterial DNA (TLR9), and double-stranded viral RNA (TLR3) (1Akira S. Kim S. Takeuchi O. Cell. 2006; 124: 783-801Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8895) Google Scholar). However, among all vertebrate TLRs, the most versatile with respect to ligand recognition is TLR2, which, in cooperation with either TLR1 or TLR6, recognizes a broad range of structures from bacteria, fungi, mycoplasma, and eukaryotic parasites (1Akira S. Kim S. Takeuchi O. Cell. 2006; 124: 783-801Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8895) Google Scholar). For example, TLR2 recognizes triacylated bacterial lipoproteins by forming a heterodimer with TLR1, and the TLR2/6 heterodimer recognizes mycoplasmal diacylated lipopeptides (2Takeda K. Kim T. Akira S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2003; 21: 335-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (4771) Google Scholar). Given the wide variety of pathogenic microbes that are recognized by TLR2, it is not surprising that this receptor (as well as its co-receptors) has been associated with susceptibility to various infectious diseases. Studies in mice have linked Tlr2 deficiency with vulnerability to infection with Staphylococcus aureus, Listeria monocytogenes, Legionella pneumophila, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and others (3Wetzler L.M. Vaccine. 2003; 21: 55-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). In addition, genetic association studies of human TLR polymorphisms have confirmed the role of TLR2 in protection from infectious disease (4Schroder N.W. Kim R.R. Lancet Infect. Dis. 2005; 5: 156-164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar). Consequently, many aspects of TLR2 structure and function have become the subject of investigation in recent years. Among these is the regulation of TLR2 expression. Given the established importance of TLR2 in various infectious diseases, as well as the potential for inappropriate activation of TLR2 signaling leading to chronic inflammation, there are likely to be mechanisms in place that tightly control expression of TLR2. TLR2 is expressed predominantly in immune cells of myeloid origin such as monocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells (5Yang R.B. Kim M.R. Gray A. Huang A. Xie M.H. Zhang M. Goddard A. Wood W.I.

Furthermore, many studies have established that TLR2 is up-regulated in blood cells taken from patients suffering from various inflammatory disorders such as bacterial sepsis, underscoring the importance of TLR2 regulation in human disease (8Viemann D.

Dis. 2004; 39: 264-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Several groups have begun to characterize the response of the TLR2 gene to various pro-inflammatory stimuli. Murine Tlr2 has been shown to be induced by whole bacteria as well as LPS and inflammatory cytokines (17Nilsen N. Kim U. Khan N. Knetter C.F. Akira S. Sundan A. Espevik T. Lien E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 39727-39735Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In addition, the murine Tlr2 promoter has been analyzed and found to contain binding sites for NF-κB and Sp1, both of which are required for transcriptional induction (18Musikacharoen T. Kim T. Kikuchi T. Yoshikai Y. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 4516-4524Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 19Wang T. Kim W.P. Zwilling B.S. J.

Studies of human TLR2 regulation have, however, yielded inconsistent results, with some groups showing that the gene is up-regulated at the mRNA level in stimulated cells (5Yang R.B. Kim M.R. Gray A.

Immunol. 2002; 168: 5629-5637Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). We believe that these inconsistencies can be attributed to variations in experimental design among these studies. Therefore, in this study, we carefully reexamine the response of the human TLR2 gene to various microbial stimuli. We report that in primary monocytes stimulated with bacterial TLR ligands, TLR2 is rapidly up-regulated at both the messenger RNA and cell surface protein levels, and we offer an explanation for previous discrepancies on this issue thus reconciling the seemingly contradictory published data. We further show that NF-κB binds to the TLR2 promoter and is required for induction, suggesting that although the mouse and human TLR2 promoters share little sequence homology, they are functionally similar. Finally, we characterize a novel mechanism for human TLR2 transcriptional activation involving NF-κB, the transcriptional co-activators CBP and p300, and histone modification. These results suggest that up-regulation of TLR2 in response to microbial challenge may be one mechanism by which the immune system shapes the inflammatory response following infection. Reagents—Synthetic bacterial lipopeptides, N-palmitoyl-S-[2,3-bis(palmitoyloxy)-propyl]-(R)-cysteinyl-(lysyl)3-lysine (Pam3CSK4), and S-[2,3-bis(palmitoyloxy)-propyl]-(R)-cysteinyl-GNNDESNISFKEK (macrophage-activating lipopeptide-2 (MALP-2)) were purchased from EMC Microcollections (Tuebingen, Germany). Repurified Salmonella minnesota Re595 lipopolysaccharide was purchased from List Biologicals (Campbell, CA). Actinomycin D and ammonium pyrrolidinedithiocarbamate (PDTC) were purchased from Sigma. Anacardic acid was purchased from Calbiochem. Plasmids—The TLR2 promoter –2800 luciferase reporter plasmid was constructed as follows. Approximately 2.8 kb of promoter region, including the first noncoding exon of TLR2, was amplified from a bacterial artificial chromosome (Library RP11, clone 153M7, Invitrogen) using the following primers: forward 5′-AGTAGATCTCGGACATACGGACATCTGTGCAGAG-3′ and reverse 5′-AGCTAAGCTTTGGGAGAACTCCGAGCAGTCAC-3′. The PCR product was then cloned as a BglII/HindIII fragment into the pGL3 basic vector (Promega, Madison, WI).

The NF-κB-binding site is underlined, and the mutated base pairs are in boldface type. The 5× NF-κB luciferase plasmid (pNF-κBLuc) containing a synthetic promoter with five direct repeats of the NF-κB consensus site linked to the luciferase gene was purchased from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). The p65 expression vector was constructed by amplifying the p65 open reading frame from human splenic cDNA using the following primers: forward 5′-AGCTAAGCTTATGGACGAACTGTTCCCCCTCATCTTC-3′, reverse 5′-AGCTGGTACCTTAGGAGCTGATCTGACTCAGCAGGG-3′. The PCR product was cloned as a HindIII/KpnI fragment into the pFLAG-CMV-1 vector (Sigma). The CBP and p300 expression vectors encoding full-length, C-terminally hemagglutinin-tagged proteins were a generous gift from Dr. Richard Eckner (University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey) (23Eckner R. Kim M.E. Newsome D. Gerdes M. DeCaprio J.A. Lawrence J.B. Livingston D.M. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 869-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (927) Google Scholar). All plasmids were purified using the endo-free plasmid purification kit from Qiagen (Valencia, CA). Cells and Transfections—Blood was obtained from healthy donors with informed consent under the University of Illinois Institutional Review Board approval. Primary monocytes were purified using the monocyte isolation kit II (Miltenyi Biotec, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany) following centrifugation through a Ficoll gradient. Monocyte preparations were >95% pure as determined by CD14 staining. Monocytes were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% autologous plasma and 1% l-glutamine. Unless indicated otherwise, monocytes in all experiments were cultured for 24 h following isolation prior to stimulation with TLR agonists or pharmacological inhibitors. 293T cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% l-glutamine. THP-1 and SW-620 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% l-glutamine. Plasmids were introduced into primary monocytes and THP-1 cells by electroporation using the Amaxa Nucleofector II (Amaxa, Cologne, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions. 5 μg of DNA and 5 × 106 cells were used per condition. 293T cells were transfected using a CaCl2 method as described elsewhere (24Wigler M. Kim A. Silverstein S. Axel R. Cell. 1978; 14: 725-731Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (776) Google Scholar) using 0.5 μg of each expression plasmid and 1.5 μg of empty vector per well in 6-well plates. SW-620 cells were transfected using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) as described previously (25Omueti K.O. Kim J.M. Johnson C.M. Lyle E.A. Tapping R.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 36616-36625Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Luciferase assays were performed using the dual luciferase assay kit (Promega, Madison, WI). Ribonuclease Protection Assay—The Riboquant ribonuclease protection assay kit (BD Biosciences) was used according to the manufacturer's instructions. 1 μg of total RNA and the human TLR-1 probe set were used. Protected fragments were resolved on a 4.75% polyacrylamide gel and detected using a Storm PhosphorImager (GE Healthcare). Relative RNA levels were quantified using ImageQuant software, and normalized to the housekeeping genes L32 and GAPDH. Real Time PCR and Real Time RT-PCR—Real time PCR was performed using the SYBR green master mix and the Taqman ABI 7900 thermocycler from Applied Biosystems (Foster City, CA). For RT-PCR experiments, 1 μg of total RNA was reverse-transcribed using SuperScript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) prior to PCR amplification. Real time RT-PCR primer sequences were as follows: TLR1, forward 5′-ACCAAGTTGTCAGCGATGTGTTCG-3′, reverse 5′-TTTGGATGGGCAAAGCATGTGGAC-3′; TLR2, forward 5′-CAGGTGACTGCTCGGAGTTC-3′, reverse 5′-CACAACTACCAGTTGAAAGCAGTGA-3′; TLR6, forward 5′-CAAGATGCTCTGAAGAAGAACAACC-3′, reverse 5′-CGTCGGAGAACTGGATTCTGG-3′; and GAPDH, forward 5′-AAGATCATCAGCAATGCCTCCTGC-3′, reverse 5′-ATGGACTGTGGTCATGAGTCCTTC-3′. Final quantifications were performed using the ΔCT method (26Fehniger T.A. Kim M.H. Turner M.J. VanDeusen J.B. Whitman S.P. Cooper M.A. Suzuki K. Wechser M. Goodsaid F. Caligiuri M.A. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 4511-4520PubMed Google Scholar) with GAPDH being used for normalization. Reactions performed in the absence of reverse transcriptase were performed to confirm the specificity of the reactions for RNA. 5′-Rapid Amplification of cDNA Ends (5′-RACE)—Transcription start sites were mapped using the RNA ligase-mediated RACE kit from Ambion (Austin, TX). Briefly, an RNA adapter oligonucleotide (5′-RACE adapter) was ligated to the 5′ end of 1 μg of total RNA. This ligated RNA was then used as template for reverse transcription followed by nested PCR amplification. Gene-specific primer sequences used for endogenous TLR2 mRNA were as follows: outer 5′-GGTGATCCTGTTGTTGGACAGGTCAAG-3 and inner 5′-GGTTCCATCTTCCAGCGGATAGAATGG-3′. Gene-specific primers used for the TLR2 promoter luciferase reporter plasmid were as follows: outer 5′-GCGCAACTGCAACTCCGATAAATAACG-3′ and inner 5′-CATAGCTTCTGCCAACCGAACGGAC-3′. PCR products were resolved on a 2% agarose gel and visualized with ethidium bromide. PCR products were subcloned using the Topo-TA cloning kit (Invitrogen), and at least 12 clones for each condition were sequenced. Electromobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—EMSAs were performed as described elsewhere (27Sun Z. Kim C.W. Ellmeier W. Schaeffer E.M. Sunshine M.J. Gandhi L. Annes J. Petrzilka D. Kupfer A. Schwartzberg P.L. Littman D.R. Nature. 2000; 404: 402-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (792) Google Scholar) with modifications. Briefly, 1 × 107 monocytes were harvested and resuspended in sucrose lysis buffer (320 mm sucrose, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 3 mm CaCl2, 2 mm MgOAc, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm dithiothreitol, plus protease inhibitors). Nuclei were then harvested and washed by centrifugation at 500 × g for 5 min. Nuclei were then resuspended in 30 μl of low salt buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 20 mm KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 25% glycerol, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, plus protease inhibitors), and 30 μl of high salt buffer (low salt buffer with 800 mm KCl and 1% Nonidet P-40) was added slowly followed by incubation on ice for 30 min. Following centrifugation at full speed for 10 min, the supernatants containing nuclear proteins were used in 10 μlof binding reactions at room temperature containing 5 μgof nuclear extract, 1 μg of poly(dI-dC) (GE Healthcare), 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm KCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100, 12.5% glycerol, 0.2 mm dithiothreitol, and the 32P-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotide probe corresponding to the region of the TLR2 promoter containing the putative NF-κB-binding site. For competition experiments, unlabeled competitor oligonucleotide was added 10 min prior to addition of labeled probe. For supershift experiments, 1 μgof α-p65 antibody or rabbit IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) was added to the binding reaction. These reactions were then resolved on a nondenaturing 5% polyacrylamide gel, which was fixed, dried, and analyzed by PhosphorImaging. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP)—ChIP experiments were performed as described elsewhere (28Miao F. Kim I.G. Lanting L. Natarajan R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 18091-18097Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar) with slight modifications. 2 × 107 monocytes were fixed for 10 min with 1% formaldehyde, and chromatin was sonicated to yield fragments between 200 and 1000 bp using the Sonics Vibracell VC130 sonicator at a setting of 25% power. Five 20-s pulses were performed with 30-s rests on ice between each pulse. Polyclonal α-p65, CBP, and p300 antibodies used for ChIP were all purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. The anti-diacetyl H3 antiserum (specific for histone H3 acetylated at Lys-9 and/or Lys-14) was a generous gift from Dr. Craig Mizzen (University of Illinois). Real time PCR primers used to amplify the endogenous TLR2 promoter were as follows: forward 5′-TCCAGAGTTCCCTCCGGC-3′ and reverse 5′-GCCCGGGACTAGGAAGTAAGC-3′. Primers used to amplify the TLR2 promoter from the luciferase reporter plasmids were as follows: forward (TLR2) 5′-TCAGGTGACTGCTCGGAGTTC-3′ and reverse (luciferase) 5′-CGTCTTCCATGGTGGCTTTACC-3′. In all experiments 10% of the input chromatin was removed prior to addition of the antibodies and used to normalize the amount of immunoprecipitated DNA. Flow Cytometry—Monocytes were stained using (R)-phycoerythrin-labeled α-TLR2 antibody (clone T2.5) or an isotype-matched control antibody from eBioscience (San Diego). Cells were run on a Coulter XL flow cytometer and analyzed using Summit analysis software. Mean fluorescence intensity values were used to quantify surface TLR2 levels after subtracting the isotype control background values. Microbial Agonists Induce TLR2 by a Mechanism Requiring New Transcription and NF-κB—To assay the effects of microbial stimulation on TLR2 gene expression, mRNA and surface protein levels were measured in primary human monocytes stimulated for varying amounts of time with MALP-2 (a lipopeptide TLR2/6 agonist). A previous study has shown that TLR2 mRNA levels in primary monocytes increased independent of any added stimulus during the first few hours of culture following isolation from peripheral blood (22Haehnel V. Kim L. Fenton M.J. Rehli M. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 5629-5637Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), and this is consistent with our observations (data not shown). To avoid this complication, monocytes were allowed to rest for 24 h following isolation prior to stimulation in all experiments (unless otherwise indicated). Fig. 1 shows that stimulation with MALP-2 caused rapid up-regulation of TLR2 mRNA, which peaked at 2 h, and surface protein levels followed with slightly delayed kinetics peaking at 4 h. This increase was transient, however, as both mRNA and surface protein returned to basal levels within 8 h after addition of the agonist. To begin characterizing the mechanism of TLR2 up-regulation, monocytes were treated with various TLR2 and TLR4 agonists for 2 h in the presence or absence of a transcriptional inhibitor, actinomycin D. Fig. 2A shows a representative autoradiograph obtained from an RNase protection assay of MALP-2-treated cells. Fig. 2B is a quantification of results from triplicate experiments with MALP-2 Pam3CSK4 (a TLR2/1 agonist), or LPS (a TLR4 agonist). These results indicate that TLR2 agonists were the most potent inducers of TLR2 gene expression, whereas the TLR4 agonist showed about one-half the capacity to induce TLR2. Furthermore, actinomycin D completely abolished up-regulation of TLR2 in response to all three stimuli indicating that new transcription is required for TLR2 induction. Because TLR agonists are known to activate the transcription factor NF-κB (29Akira S. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 2006; 311: 1-16PubMed Google Scholar), we next wished to test the hypothesis that NF-κB is required for the observed agonist-induced TLR2 up-regulation. To this end, cells were treated with MALP-2 in the presence or absence of a pharmacological inhibitor, PDTC, which has been shown to prevent nuclear translocation of NF-κB in human monocytes (30Ziegler-Heitbrock H.W. Kim T. Liese J. Belohradsky B. Weber C. Wedel A. Schreck R. Bauerle P. Strobel M. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 6986-6993PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 3 shows that PDTC treatment completely abolished TLR2 up-regulation in response to MALP-2 indicating that NF-κB activity is required for this process. The TLR2 Promoter Contains a Putative NF-κB-binding Site—As our results suggest that NF-κB is involved in TLR2 regulation, we next wished to examine the TLR2 promoter to determine whether a putative binding site for this transcription factor was present. Fig. 4A shows a schematic diagram of the TLR2 gene along with an enlargement of the sequence surrounding the beginning of exon I. A near-consensus NF-κB-binding site (underlined) is found in close proximity to the beginning of exon I. However, a previous characterization of the TLR2 transcriptional start site in freshly isolated monocytes showed that the major start site was located within the NF-κB sequence itself (22Haehnel V. Kim L. Fenton M.J. Rehli M. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 5629-5637Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) causing doubt about whether this binding site could actually be used by NF-κB. We hypothesized that the transcriptional start site would change under various conditions of culture and stimulation, thus allowing NF-κB access to its binding site. To test this idea, we mapped the transcriptional start site of TLR2 under all conditions used in this study. Fig. 4B shows the results of 5′-RACE analysis using cells that were either freshly isolated or cultured overnight followed by MALP-2 treatment as indicated. Interestingly, the transcriptional start profile was significantly different in each case. To precisely map the sites used, the PCR products were cloned and sequenced. Fig. 4C shows that in freshly isolated cells there is a clear preference for transcription initiation at a site 27 bp downstream of the putative NF-κB site (+27), with promiscuity for additional initiation sites farther upstream. However, in cells cultured for 24 h, two dominant start sites were identified (+27 and +43), and in cells cultured for 24 h and then treated with MALP-2, initiation returned predominantly to the +27 with little utilization of sites farther upstream. We next wished to determine whether mutation of the NF-κB-binding site would affect the position of the TLR2 transcriptional start site. To accomplish this, monocytes were transfected with plasmids containing either the wild-type or an NF-κB mutant TLR2 promoter fused to the luciferase gene. As before, cells were then allowed to rest in culture for 24 h. Primers for 5′-RACE were designed to detect only mRNA transcribed from the transfected plasmid and not from endogenous TLR2 mRNA. Fig. 5 shows the results of 5′-RACE performed using resting or MALP-2-treated cells as indicated. In cells transfected with the wild-type TLR2 reporter plasmid, MALP-2 induced a clear shift from the +27/+43 profile to only +27, similar to the sites utilized by the endogenous TLR2 gene (compare Fig. 5, lanes 1 and 2, to Fig. 4B, lanes 2 and 3). However, in cells transfected with the TLR2 reporter plasmid containing the mutated NF-κB-binding site, the effect of MALP-2 on the position of transcription initiation seemed to be lost, and in both resting and stimulated cells the transcription start site became less precisely defined with promiscuity for additional sites. These results suggest that the binding of NF-κB to this proximal site in the TLR2 promoter plays a role in determining the position of transcriptional initiation. NF-κB Binds to Its TLR2 Site in Vitro—Having identified a potential binding site for NF-κBinthe TLR2 promoter, we next investigated whether NF-κB could bind specifically to this site using electromobility shift assays. Nuclear extracts from MALP-2-treated monocytes were used in binding reactions with a probe containing the putative TLR2 NF-κB site (Fig. 6). The results of this experiment show that NF-κB bound to the TLR2 probe in a MALP-2-dependent fashion, and this binding was eliminated by addition of a wild-type (but not an NF-κB mutant) competitor oligonucleotide. Furthermore, addition of an antibody specific for the p65 subunit of NF-κB (but not a nonspecific antibody) induced a supershift. These results indicate that NF-κB is able to specifically interact with the predicted binding site in the TLR2 promoter. NF-κB Is Recruited to Its Binding Site in the Proximal TLR2 Promoter in Vivo—We next wished to measure the in vivo affinity of NF-κB for its site in the TLR2 promoter. To this end, 293T cells were transfected with either the wild-type or NF-κB mutant TLR2 reporter plasmids used above and subjected to ChIP analysis to monitor NF-κB recruitment to the plasmid. The PCR primer set used for this experiment was designed to amplify only TLR2 DNA from the reporter plasmid and not genomic DNA. Fig. 6C shows that p65 was recruited to the wild-type reporter plasmid within 2 h after stimulation with MALP-2, but this recruitment was reduced ∼3-fold in cells transfected with the plasmid containing the mutated NF-κB site. These data indicate that NF-κB is recruited to the TLR2 promoter in activated monocytes, and the identified binding site is required for this recruitment. A TLR2 Reporter Gene Is Not Induced by Stimulation with MALP-2—We next wished to test the ability of TLR2 agonists to induce a reporter construct containing the TLR2 promoter fused to the luciferase gene. To this end, three different cell lines (THP-1, 293T, and SW620) were transiently transfected with either the TLR2 construct or a positive control NF-κB-driven luciferase plasmid and then stimulated with MALP-2 as indicated (Fig. 7). In all three cell lines tested, the TLR2 construct was completely unresponsive to stimulation with MALP-2, whereas the NF-κB-driven reporter was induced. Overexpression of NF-κB p65, CBP, and p300 Is Sufficient to Induce TLR2 Expression—The lack of inducibility of the TLR2 reporter gene, taken together with our results showing an actinomycin D-sensitive increase in expression of TLR2, led us to hypothesi"
https://openalex.org/W2051873927,"MeaB is an auxiliary protein that plays a crucial role in the protection and assembly of the B12-dependent enzyme methylmalonyl-CoA mutase. Impairments in the human homologue of MeaB, MMAA, lead to methylmalonic aciduria, an inborn error of metabolism. To explore the role of this metallochaperone, its structure was solved in the nucleotide-free form, as well as in the presence of product, GDP.

In the past few decades, an increasing number of guanine nucleotide-binding protein (G proteins) that act as chaperones in the assembly of target metalloenzymes have been described (1Mulrooney S.B.

Typically, G proteins act as molecular switches, with regions known as switch I and switch II undergoing large conformational changes upon GTP hydrolysis to communicate a signal.

MeaB itself differs from the other G3E G proteins in that it possesses N- and C-terminal extensions of unknown function. MeaB is an auxiliary protein associated with methylmalonyl-CoA mutase (MCM) 2The abbreviations used are: MCM, methylmalonyl-CoA mutase; MMA, methylmalonic aciduria; MMAA, methylmalonic aciduria type A; ATR, ATP:cobalamin adenosyltransferase; DTNB, 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid); PEG, polyethylene glycol; MAD, multiple wavelength anomalous dispersion; NCS, non-crystallographic symmetry; TCEP, Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine; r.m.s., root mean square; GTPγS, guanosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate); GMP-PNP, guanosine 5′-(β,γ-imino)triphosphate.

Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 9300-9306Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), a coenzyme B12 (adenosylcobalamin)-dependent enzyme that catalyzes the chemically challenging 1,2-rearrangement of methylmalonyl-CoA to succinyl-CoA using radical-based chemistry (11Banerjee R. Chem. Rev. 2003; 103: 2083-2094Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 12Banerjee R. Kim S.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2003; 72: 209-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar). A human orthologue of MeaB, MMAA, has been found to be the locus of mutations associated with type A (cblA) methylmalonic aciduria (MMA) (13Dobson C.M. Kim T. Leclerc D. Wilson A. Wu X. Dore C. Hudson T. Rosenblatt D.S. Gravel R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 15554-15559Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), a rare congenital disease that manifests itself during fetal development or shortly after birth; symptoms include chronic acidosis and mental retardation (13Dobson C.M. Kim T. Leclerc D. Wilson A. Wu X. Dore C. Hudson T. Rosenblatt D.S. Gravel R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 15554-15559Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). This genetic evidence identifies MeaB/MMAA as an important auxiliary protein for MCM. While its exact role is currently being investigated, MCM requirement for coenzyme B12 suggests several possibilities for MeaB function, including roles in protecting the enzyme from oxidative inactivation and cofactor insertion/removal (7Korotkova N. Kim M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 13652-13658Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 9Padovani D. Kim T. Banerjee R. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 17838-17844Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 10Padovani D. Kim R. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 9300-9306Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Naturally occurring forms of B12 are powerful catalysts; used for radical-generation in the case of adenosylcobalamin and as potent nucleophiles for methyl transfer reactions in the case of cob(I)alamin. Because of their highly reactive nature, the cobalamin cofactor can be easily inactivated, inhibiting the enzyme. Because this inactivation is highly undesirable, nature has developed at least three possible remedies, all of which involve accessory proteins: (i) reduction in situ of aB12 intermediate that has undergone oxidative inactivation, (ii) replacement of the inactive B12 cofactor with a new cofactor, and (iii) protection of the reactive B12 species by sequestration from solvent. Methionine synthase, the only other B12-dependent enzyme in mammals, uses NADPH-dependent methionine synthase reductase to reductively reactivate the oxidized inactive B12 cofactor (14Fujii K. Kim J.H. Huennekens F.M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1977; 178: 662-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). A corresponding reductase for MCM has not been found. B12-dependent eliminases like diol dehydratase use an ATP-dependent mechanism to exchange the oxidized inactive cofactor for an active one (15Toraya T. Kim K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3372-3377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar); however, such chaperones do not appear to be present in operons that encode MCM. Thus MCM does not appear to utilize the first two methods, leaving the third possibility that MeaB could play a role in cofactor protection during catalysis. This hypothesis has been investigated by testing the rate of cob(II)alamin oxidation on MCM in the presence of various nucleotide-bound forms of MeaB (10Padovani D. Kim R. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 9300-9306Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Results indicate that GTP-MeaB affords 15-fold protection in a GTPase-independent manner, suggesting that protection from oxidative damage during catalysis is one role for this chaperone. It is interesting that the protection afforded by GDP-MeaB is much less (3-fold) than for GTP-MeaB, as is the estimated buried surface area between MeaB and MCM (∼4000 Å2 for GDP form versus ∼6950 Å2 for the GTP form), indicating that the structure of GTP-MeaB and the structure of GDP-MeaB are notably different. In thinking about how GTP-MeaB could protect the cobalamin cofactor in a GTPase-independent fashion, one must consider that crystallographic studies show that MCM undergoes a major conformational change during catalysis; a substrate-binding TIM barrel splits open allowing product dissociation, and seals closed again upon substrate binding (16Mancia F. Kim P.R. Structure. 1998; 6: 711-720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). During these conformational changes, the simple binding of MeaB to MCM could help to sequester the MCM-bound cofactor from solvent. Because many metallochaperones have been implicated in cofactor insertion (17Maier T. Kim F. Bock A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 230: 133-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 18Soriano A. Kim R.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11140-11144Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 19Mori K. Kim T. Toraya T. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 1997; 61: 1729-1733Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), it is also important to consider this function for MeaB. For MCM, it is postulated that ATP:cobalamin adenosyltransferase (ATR) delivers the adenosylcobalamain cofactor to MCM; however, for MCM to accept this cofactor, crystallographic analysis suggests that MCM would have to undergo a large conformational change that repositions the B12-binding Rossmann domain away from the substrate-binding TIM barrel (16Mancia F. Kim P.R. Structure. 1998; 6: 711-720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Here, the GTPase-dependent activity of MeaB could play a role in reconfiguring the MCM structure to accept the cofactor from ATR. Thus, while the detailed functions of MeaB are still being established, potential roles in cofactor assembly and protection are intriguing possibilities to consider, and there is no doubt as to the importance of MeaB proteins in MCM activity based on cblA MMA disease data. Because of their inherent propensity to unfold and aggregate, to date only two G3E GTPases have been structurally characterized (5Gasper R. Kim A. Wittinghofer A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 27492-27502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 36Khil P.P. Kim G. Teplyakov A. Howard A.J. Gilliland G.L. Camerini-Otero R.D. Proteins. 2004; 54: 371-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). While sequence homology with other GTPases strongly suggests the G domain folds in a manner similar to other structurally known GTPases, the significance of the N- and C-terminal extensions found in MeaB are unknown. To investigate the significance of these amino acid extensions, as well as to gain an understanding of the structural basis of MMAA and the role MeaB plays in regulating MCM activity, we determined product-bound and substrate-free structures of MeaB from Methylobacterium extorquens AM1. Our structural results suggest that the C terminus is critical in formation of the homodimer, while we speculate that the N terminus may function in the interaction with MCM. In addition, mapping the point mutations known to correlate with the occurrence of MMAA onto the structure of MeaB, in conjunction with biochemical analysis of these mutants, allows us to propose the structural basis for this disease. Finally, the overall topology of this enzyme gives clues as to how MeaB associates with MCM to influence mutase activity. Protein Expression and Purification—MeaB from M. extorquens was expressed using the pET21d::meaB vector (generously provided by Dr. Mary Lidstrom, University of Washington) and purified as described previously (9Padovani D. Kim T. Banerjee R. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 17838-17844Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Mutants were made using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The following sense mutagenic primers were used: L11P (5′-CGACATGGACACACCCCGCGAGCGGCTTC-3′), R57Q (5′-ACGGGGCGGGCGATCCAGGTTGGC-3′), F119C (5′-CTCGCCATCGACCGCAACGCCTGCATCCGGCCCTCGCCCTCCTC-3′), R272Q (5′-GACCGGCGAGATCGCGGGCAAGCAGCGCGAGCAGGACGTGAAGTG-3′). The presence of the mutation was verified by DNA sequencing. All mutants were purified in the same manner as wild type MeaB. For crystallization, purified native protein was concentrated to ∼7 mg/ml in 50 mm Hepes, pH 8.0, 300 mm KCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, and 10% glycerol, and stored at –80 °C prior to use. Selenomethionine-labeled (SeMet) MeaB protein was expressed in an identical manner, but with cells grown in minimal media supplemented with l-SeMet and concentrated to ∼8.4 mg/ml. Methylmalonyl-CoA Mutase Assay—The specific activity of methylmalonyl-CoA mutase was analyzed using the radiolabel-based assay at 37 °C as previously described (20Taoka S. Kim R. Lai M.T. Liu H.W. Banerjee R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31630-31634Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The effect of the MeaB F119C mutant on the kinetic parameters of methylmalonyl-CoA mutase was determined in the presence of 1 mm Mg-GDP, 50 μm 5′-deoxyadenosylcobalamin, and 2.5 mm (R,S)-[14C]methylmalonyl-CoA in 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, by varying the concentration of MeaB F119C from 2 to 75 nm. Quantification of Free Thiol Groups—The free thiol group content of wild type MeaB and the F119C mutant (15 μm) was determined by titration with 0.1 mm 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB, Sigma) in 50 mm Hepes, pH 8.0, containing 300 mm NaCl. After incubation for 15 min at room temperature, the absorbance at 412 nm was recorded, and the number of free thiol groups was calculated using an extinction coefficient of 13,600 m–1 cm–1 (21Gill S.C. Kim P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5070) Google Scholar). Protein Crystallization—Crystals of the native form of MeaB with GDP bound were grown at room temperature using the hanging drop technique; 1.5 μl of native protein at ∼7 mg/ml in 50 mm Hepes, pH 8.0, 300 mm KCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, and 10% glycerol was added to 1.0 μl of precipitant solution (0.1 m Bis-Tris, pH 5.5, 0.2 m Li2SO4, and 17% polyethylene glycol (PEG) 3350) and placed over 0.5 ml of precipitant. In addition, 0.2 μlof GDP dissolved in water was added to the drop to give a final nucleotide concentration of 2 mm in the crystallization reagent, while 0.2 μl of 0.4 mm Zwittergent 3-14 was also included to reduce layering of crystals. Cryoprotection of native crystals was achieved by immersion in precipitant solution containing 20% ethylene glycol, before being flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. SeMet MeaB was crystallized with GDP using the same precipitant solution, but with ∼20% (v/v) ethylene glycol used in place of Zwittergent 3-14. After optimization, crystals could be grown that generally appeared single, having maximum dimensions of 400 × 400 × 50 μm after 3–4 days. Unfortunately, even though these crystals appeared single, upon examination of diffraction properties, the majority contained multiple crystal lattices. As a result, many crystals were tested until one deemed suitable for data collection was found. In an attempt to determine the structure of MeaB bound with a GTP analogue, SeMet MeaB was crystallized under identical conditions to the SeMet MeaB:GDP complex, but with 10 mm of non-hydrolyzable GTP analog GMP-PNP in 160 mm MgSO4 used in place of GDP. The selenomethionine-labeled protein was used because of its superior crystallization and diffraction qualities over native MeaB, and the fact that it is perfectly isomorphous to the native form. Analysis of the initial |Fo|–|Fc| map showed no nucleotide was bound, which was subsequently confirmed during refinement. This crystal form was therefore considered to be the nucleotide-free, or apo-form. Data Processing, Model Building, and Refinement—Multiple Wavelength Anomalous Dispersion (MAD) data on a single SeMet-GDP MeaB crystal were collected using the inverse beam technique around the selenium absorption edge at beam line 11-1, Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory (SSRL). Data on a GDP-MeaB crystal were collected to 1.85 Å at the Argonne National Laboratory Advanced Photon Source (APS), beam line 17-ID. High resolution diffraction data of the apo-form were collected at beam line 9-2, SSRL. Data were integrated and scaled using HKL or HKL-2000 (22Otwinowski Z. Kim W. Macromolecular Crystallogr., Pt A. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38597) Google Scholar), with the MAD data scaled together using SCALEIT (23Howell P.L. Kim G.D. J. Appl.

Macromolecular Crystallogr., Pt A. 1997; 276: 472-494Crossref Scopus (1797) Google Scholar) using all MAD data. Data collection statistics are summarized in Table 1. About 70% of the model, containing two molecules per asymmetric unit, was automatically built in RESOLVE using Non-Crystallographic Symmetry (NCS) averaging (25Terwilliger T.C. Kim J.

Padovani and R. Banerjee, unpublished observations. None of these loci appear to form any crystal contacts, and there are no interactions within the asymmetric unit that appear to suggest this triple mutant confers any advantage in crystallographic studies over wild type. Once the GDP-bound SeMet model was complete, the B-factors were reset, and the model refined against the high resolution GDP-MeaB data. Water molecules were then included automatically using ARP/wARP (30Morris R.J. Kim A. Lamzin V.S.

Open table in a new tab The crystals of apo-MeaB, derived from an unsuccessful attempt to co-crystallize MeaB with the GTP analog GMP-PNP, were formed under the same conditions as the GDP-bound form, also belonging to space group P21; however, the crystals have different unit cell parameters (see Table 1). Therefore, the GDP-bound model was used as a probe for molecular replacement using PHASER (32Read R.J. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2001; 57: 1373-1382Crossref PubMed Scopus (788) Google Scholar), with rigid-body refinement confirming the solution to be correct. The model was then refined using the same protocol given for the GDP-bound structure, with the same FreeR flags used in both datasets. The refined apo model includes residues 4–180 and 187–329 of molecule 1, and residues 6–203 and residues 210–329 of molecule 2. Model refinement statistics are listed in Table 2. Overall Structure of MeaB—Inspection of the crystal lattice shows two molecules of MeaB per asymmetric unit, with their arrangement suggesting the protein to be a homodimer, consistent with results obtained from gel filtration and light scattering experiments (9Padovani D. Kim T. Banerjee R. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 17838-17844Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Each monomer can be considered as being composed of three regions; a central G domain, which includes a 7 parallel-stranded β-sheet that houses the GTPase active site, and α-helical extensions at both the N and C termini (Fig. 1). The C-terminal extension, composed of ∼70 amino acids, appears critical in forming the dimer interface as its three α-helices interlock with the neighboring subunit (highlighted in Fig. 1). However, the total intermolecular interface is relatively small, being just 4800 Å2, or about 18% of the total molecular surface. The N-terminal extension is also composed of three α-helices, totaling ∼50 amino acids. This region resides near the C-terminal dimerization extension, but on the opposite side of the molecule to the active site. The G Domain—Inspection of the G domain shows it possesses the same topology as other structurally characterized members of the SIMIBI class, being composed of a 7-stranded parallel β-sheet embellished by α-helices. SIMIBI and TRAFAC are the two major classes of G proteins (8Leipe D.D. Kim Y.I. Koonin E.V. Aravind L. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 317: 41-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (858) Google Scholar), and while TRAFAC G proteins display a six-stranded β-sheet containing one antiparallel stand, SIMIBI G proteins are recognized by the presence of a seven-stranded parallel β-sheet. In comparison of MeaB with one of the better studied SIMIBI G proteins, Ffh (Protein Data Bank code 1RJ9) (33Egea P.F. Kim S.O. Napetschnig J. Savage D.F. Walter P. Stroud R.M. Nature. 2004; 427: 215-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar), the r.m.s. deviation of 113 Cα-atoms is only 1.8 Å. Interestingly, the structural homology is not quite as good when MeaB is compared with HypB (Protein Data Bank code 2HF9) (5Gasper R. Kim A. Wittinghofer A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 27492-27502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), which unlike Ffh belongs in the same G3E subfamily of GTPases (the metallochaperone subfamily). For 91 Cα atoms (as opposed to 113), the r.m.s. deviation between MeaB and HypB is 1.9 Å (compared with 1.8 Å for Ffh). GTPases are characterized by four motifs: (i) the P-loop (Walker A), which coordinates the phosphate moieties of the guanine nucleotide through hydrogen bonding with backbone nitrogen atoms, (ii) a guanine base specificity loop, (iii and iv) switch I and II regions that interact with the nucleotide and Mg2+ in the active site, activate water for GTP hydrolysis, and signal via conformational change that GTP hydrolysis has occurred. While functions of these motifs are conserved among the various subfamilies of GTPases, there are sequence differences that serve to identify proteins as particular subfamily members. Structure analysis of GDP-MeaB confirms that it is a member of the G3E (metallochaperone) family, containing the appropriate sequence motifs at the expected places in the structure (8Leipe D.D. Kim Y.I. Koonin E.V. Aravind L. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 317: 41-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (858) Google Scholar). For the P-loop (Walker A motif) we find the expected GXXGXGK(S/T) variant in the form of 62GVPGVGKS69 providing backbone amide nitrogens to interact with the phosphate moieties of GDP (Figs. 1, 2, and 3), and for the base specificity loop, we find the expected intact NKXD motif in the form of 200NKAD204 (Figs. 1, 2, 3). In the switch II (or Walker B) region, G3E proteins substitute a glutamate for the conserved Mg2+ binding-aspartate residue (8Leipe D.D. Kim Y.I. Koonin E.V. Aravind L. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 317: 41-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (858) Google Scholar). Although Mg2+ is not bound in any of our structures, the switch II motif (Glu154-Gly157) houses Glu154 which, according to structural alignment with HypB Glu120, is likely to coordinate Mg2+ in the GTP-bound enzyme form. In addition to Glu154, Ser69 from the P-loop of MeaB is likely to coordinate the Mg2+ ion (homologous to Thr47 in HypB). HypB shows a third amino acid, Asp75, is involved in direct coordination with Mg2+, and forms part of an α-helix (Fig. 2). The corresponding region in the GDP-bound form of MeaB is completely disordered, and is a random coil in the apo-form; however, it is possible that when bound to GTP, the corresponding residue, Asp105, may reposition itself to coordinate the metal ion.

https://openalex.org/W2040250369,"Lytic infection by Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) is associated with an extensive shutoff of host gene expression, mediated chiefly by accelerated mRNA turnover due to expression of the viral SOX protein. We have previously identified a small number of host mRNAs that can escape SOX-mediated degradation. Here we present a detailed, transcriptome-wide analysis of host shutoff, with careful microarray normalization to allow rigorous determination of the magnitude and extent of transcript loss. We find that the extent of transcript reduction represents a continuum of susceptibilities of transcripts to virus-mediated shutoff. Our results affirm that the levels of over 75% of host transcripts are substantially reduced during lytic infection, but also show that another approximately 20% of cellular mRNAs declines only slightly (less than 2-fold) during the course of infection. Approximately 2% of examined cellular genes are strongly upregulated during lytic infection, most likely due to transcriptional induction of mRNAs that display intrinsic SOX-resistance."

All PKDs are regulated by DAG/phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-binding C1 domains and an activation loop (A-loop). To understand how PKD isoforms diversify DAG signaling networks, it is essential to determine redundant and novel properties of their regulatory domains, characterize factors controlling PKD gene expression, and discover their in vivo physiological roles. Studies on a novel PKD, Caenorhabditis elegans DKF-2 (D kinase family-2), addressed these topics. The C1b domain mediates phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-induced translocation and activation of DKF-2. However, when DAG is elevated, C1a and C1b contribute equally to targeting/activation of DKF-2. DKF-2 C1 domains do not inhibit catalytic activity; they mediate delivery of DKF-2 to a membrane where protein kinase C phosphorylates Ser925 and Ser929 in the A-loop. This potently stimulates DKF-2 catalytic activity. Phosphorylation of Ser925 alone switches on 70% of maximal kinase activity. Persistent phosphorylation of Ser929 tags DKF-2 for proteasomal degradation; Ser(P)925 plays a minor role in DKF-2 degradation. GATA enhancer sequences govern DKF-2 expression in intestine in vivo. Adult life span increases 40% in animals lacking DKF-2. In thermally stressed wild type animals, the DAF-16 transcription factor is segregated from the nuclei of adult intestinal cells. In contrast, DAF-16 enters adult intestinal nuclei of DKF-2-deficient, thermally stressed animals, where it can trigger gene transcription that protects against various insults.

PKDs are ubiquitously expressed, but levels of individual isoforms vary with cell type. Like PKCs, PKDs have two C1 modules (putative DAG binding) and a C-terminal kinase domain (Fig. 1B). Unlike PKCs, PKDs contain a centrally located PH domain but lack a pseudosubstrate motif. Amino acid sequences of PKD and PKC catalytic domains are divergent.

Besides activating PKDs, PKCs phosphorylate and regulate a large constellation of effector proteins. However, PKDs phosphorylate and control distinct substrates (11Doppler H. Kim P. Li J. Comb M.J.

By recruiting novel effectors to PLC-DAG controlled signaling pathways, PKDs extend the range of functions regulated by hormones and growth factors. Activation of PKDs is associated with Golgi vesicle fission and trafficking, cytokine secretion, apoptosis, NFκB activation, antigen-induced T and B cell signaling, oxidative stress, modulation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) activity, and other physiological processes (3Spitaler M.

Phosphorylation of these proteins activates gene expression involved in cardiac hypertrophy and T cell apoptosis, promotes production of Golgi vesicles that transport proteins to cell membranes, and protects cells against stress-induced injury. Current knowledge of PKD regulation and functions is incomplete. One puzzle is that homologous regulatory domains control catalytic activity via dissimilar mechanisms in different PKDs (5Rozengurt E. Kim O. Waldron R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 13205-13208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar, 17Feng H. Kim M. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 17815-17826Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). For example, the PKD1 PH domain inhibits catalytic activity (18Iglesias T. Kim E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 410-416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), whereas PH domain mutations in a Caenorhabditis elegans PKD (named DKF-1, for D kinase family 1) extinguish kinase activity (17Feng H. Kim M. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 17815-17826Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Physiological roles of PKDs have been inferred from studies on transfected cells, but it is not known if roles assigned to PKDs are major or minor functions of D kinases in normal differentiated cells. In vivo functions of PKDs have not been analyzed by gene disruption or “knock-in” approaches, and identities of most PKD effectors are unknown. Consequently, we lack understanding of PKD functions in normal, organized tissues and overall animal physiology. Activated PKDs translocate from plasma membrane to Golgi and mitochondrial membranes and nuclei, where elevated kinase activity persists for minutes to hours. Routing of PKDs to multiple intracellular destinations enables dissemination of DAG signals to an expanded range of substrate-effector proteins. Thus, properties of PKDs apparently enable transiently produced DAG to exert both short and long term temporal and spatial control over cell functions. To fully comprehend the physiological roles of PKDs, it is essential to elucidate mechanisms underlying the generation and maintenance of activated PKDs. Current knowledge of three contributing factors, the regulation of the recruitment and activation of PKDs at the cell surface, control of PKD stability, and determinants of PKD gene expression, is limited. Central problems in PKD regulation and functions can be addressed in C. elegans. This model organism employs signaling molecules, mechanisms, and pathways that are conserved from nematodes to man (19Huang P. Kim M.J.

EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3959-3970Crossref PubMed Scopus (2453) Google Scholar), in concert with molecular and classical genetics, provide powerful tools for illuminating regulation and physiological functions of PKDs in intact animals. Insights acquired from studies on C. elegans PKDs can guide complementary investigations in mammalian systems. Studies on DKF-1, a C. elegans PKD, confirmed the value of the model system (17Feng H. Kim M. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 17815-17826Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 27Feng H. Kim M. Wu S.L. Hall D.H. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 17801-17814Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). DKF-1 has the substrate specificity and structural hallmarks of a typical PKD. However, DKF-1 and PKDs differ as follows: (a) in regulatory properties and functions of their C1 and PH domains and (b) in mechanisms that control A-loop phosphorylation. In addition, DKF-1 is activated by DAG but not by PKCs. Gene disruption revealed that DKF-1 is essential for neuromuscular control of lower body movement (27Feng H. Kim M. Wu S.L. Hall D.H. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 17801-17814Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). These investigations provided novel insights into the activation mechanism, regulatory capabilities, and physiological function of a member of the PKD family. We now report the characterization of a novel C. elegans PKD, named DKF-2. DKF-2 and mammalian PKD1 have similar structures and substrate specificities. However, regulatory properties and functions of C1 and PH domains are strikingly different in the two kinases. Two phosphoserines in the A-loop differentially control catalytic activity and stability of DKF-2. GATA enhancer sequences regulate selective expression of DKF-2 in intestinal cells in vivo. In adult intestine, DKF-2 negatively regulates a transcription factor that activates stress response genes. This suggests an explanation for the discovery that DKF-2 deficiency significantly extends life span. Isolation of cDNA Encoding DKF-2—Complementary DNA encoding DKF-2 was obtained as described under “Results.” DKF-2 cDNA was sequenced as described previously (28Chen Q. Kim R.Y. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15247-15257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). DNA and Protein Data Analysis—Analysis of sequence data, sequence comparisons, and data base searches were performed using Blast programs (NCBI Server, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda), the SMART website (EMBL, Heidelberg, Germany), ClustalW, and pattern/motif search programs (European Bioinformatics Institute, Hinxton, UK) and programs supplied by the Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics (Geneva, Switzerland). Information about C. elegans genomic DNA, cDNAs, ESTs and proteins was obtained from WormBase (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY). Preparation of Antibodies Directed against DKF-2—A fragment of DKF-2 cDNA encoding amino acids 1–203 was synthesized via PCR, using primers with NdeI (5′) and BamHI (3′) restriction sites. Amplified DNA was digested with NdeI and BamHI and cloned into the isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside-inducible bacterial expression plasmid pET-14b (Novagen). Vector DNA encodes a His6 tag peptide that is appended to the N terminus of partial DKF-2 protein. A 1-liter culture of Escherichia coli BL21 was transformed with recombinant plasmid, induced with isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, and disrupted as described previously (28Chen Q. Kim R.Y. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15247-15257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Approximately 2 mg of DKF-2 fusion protein was purified to near homogeneity by affinity chromatography on nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose resin (Qiagen). DKF-2 fusion protein was injected into rabbits (0.4-mg initial injection; 0.2 mg for each of five booster injections) at 3-week intervals (Proteintech, Chicago). Antiserum was collected at 3-week intervals. IgGs directed against DKF-2 were affinity-purified by chromatography on Sepharose 4B beads derivatized with DKF-2 fusion protein (1.5 mg of protein/ml beads) and stored as reported previously (29Wu S.L. Kim J. Olson E.N. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1130-1143Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Antibodies Directed against PKD1 and Phosphorylated A-loops of PKD1 and DKF-2—Rabbit IgGs directed against Ser(P)744 in the PKD1 A-loop were purchased from Cell Signaling (Danvers, MA). Di-phosphorylated A-loop peptide (Ser(P)744 and Ser(P)748) was used as antigen, but the antibodies selectively bind Ser(P)744 (Ser(P)925 in DKF-2) and do not ligate Ser(P)748 (Ser(P)929 in DKF-2). For details, see Waldron et al. (10Waldron R.T. Kim O. Iglesias T. Tugal T. Cantrell D. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32606-32615Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) and Fig. 7C under “Results.” Rabbit anti-PKD1 IgGs were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). The antibodies were generated by injection of nonphosphorylated C-terminal peptide antigen and are used to detect total endogenous PKD1. These IgGs bind nonphosphorylated PKD1 with high affinity but have reduced affinity when PKD1 is phosphorylated, as described by Rennecke et al. (30Rennecke J. Kim F.J. Richter K.H. Kittstein W. Marks F. Gschwendt M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 242: 428-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Expression of DKF-2 in Mammalian Cells—Full-length DKF-2 cDNA was excised from recombinant pBluescript SKII by digestion with XbaI and Asp718 and cloned into corresponding sites in pcDNA3.1+ (Invitrogen). This mammalian expression vector contains a constitutively active cytomegalovirus promoter. Hamster AV-12 or human HEK293 cells were grown and transfected with recombinant plasmid DNAs using Lipofectamine™ (Invitrogen) as described previously (27Feng H. Kim M. Wu S.L. Hall D.H. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 17801-17814Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Cloned cell lines stably expressing modest amounts of WT and mutant DKF-2 proteins were isolated by selection with 1 mg/ml G418 for 14 days. Immunoprecipitation and in Vitro Kinase Assays—Cells were lysed in buffer containing 1% Triton X-100 as reported (31Hirsch A.H. Kim S.B. Li Y. You Y. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2131-2134Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Operations were performed at 4 °C. DKF-2, DKF-1, or endogenous PKD1 was isolated by immunoprecipitation with monospecific, affinity-purified antibodies. (Tests for antibody cross reactivity were negative.) After centrifugation (40,000 × g, 30 min) the supernatant solution (0.3 mg of protein) received 1 μg of anti-DKF-2 IgG (or anti-DKF-1 IgG or anti-PKD IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology)). Samples were incubated for 3 h. Next, 25 μl of protein G-Sepharose 4B beads was added, and incubations were extended 1 h. Subsequently, bead-bound immune complexes were washed five times as reported previously (27Feng H. Kim M. Wu S.L. Hall D.H. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 17801-17814Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Amounts of immunoprecipitated WT and mutant DKF-2 proteins are assessed by Western immunoblotting (e.g. see Fig. 7B, below). All kinase assays for a given set of experimental conditions are then performed with equal amounts of WT and/or mutant DKF-2 proteins. Catalytic activity of DKF-2 was quantified by measuring incorporation of 32P radioactivity from [γ-32P]ATP into peptide substrate. Reaction buffer (30 μl), which contains 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 30 μm Syntide-2 peptide substrate (Calbiochem), 100 μm [γ-32P]ATP (∼150 cpm/pmol), 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EGTA, and 1 mm dithiothreitol, was added to immune complexes, and samples were incubated at 30 °C for 10 min. Reactions were terminated by adding 5 μl of 0.2 m EDTA, pH 8.0. Reaction mixtures were applied to P81 filter papers (Whatman). Filters were washed and air-dried as previously indicated (27Feng H. Kim M. Wu S.L. Hall D.H. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 17801-17814Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). 32P radioactivity incorporated into Syntide-2 was measured in a scintillation counter. To test effects of PKC inhibition on DKF-2 catalytic activity, cells were incubated with bisindolylmaleimide I (GF109203X) (Axxora) for 1 h. Cells were then treated with specified concentrations of PMA for 10 min. In vitro kinase assays were performed as described above. Possible direct effects of GF109203X on DKF-2 activity were tested in vitro by adding the inhibitor to the kinase reaction mixture. Preparation of Cytosol and Total Membrane Proteins in Translocation Assays—Cells were disrupted in hypotonic detergent-free buffer, as stated previously (17Feng H. Kim M. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 17815-17826Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 31Hirsch A.H. Kim S.B. Li Y. You Y. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2131-2134Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cytosol (supernatant) and total membranes (pellet) were isolated by centrifugation at 120,000 × g. Volumes of cytosol and pellet fractions were adjusted so that equal aliquots represent equal numbers of starting cells (normalization to protein could also be used; cytosol and pellet each contained 50% of total protein). Samples containing 30 μg of cytosolic or membrane proteins were applied to each lane in denaturing gels. For Western blot analysis, 14-3-3 (invariant in cytosol) and IGF-1 receptor (invariant in membranes) were monitored as loading controls. Antibodies directed against 14-3-3 and IGF-1 receptor were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. For in vitro kinase assays, membrane-bound DKF-2 was solubilized with 1% Triton X-100 and immunoprecipitated with affinity-purified IgGs (see above). All DKF-2 protein was solubilized from total membranes (or intact cells) by buffer containing Triton X-100. No DKF-2 was evident in the final detergent-resistant pellet. Electrophoresis of Proteins and Western Immunoblot Assays—Proteins were size-fractionated by electrophoresis in a denaturing polyacrylamide (8%) gel as reported previously (32Ndubuka C. Kim Y. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7621-7624Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Western blots of size-fractionated proteins were prepared, blocked, incubated with anti-DKF-2 (or other) IgGs (1:1000) and washed, as indicated in previous studies (31Hirsch A.H. Kim S.B. Li Y. You Y. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2131-2134Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Ndubuka C. Kim Y. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7621-7624Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Unless noted otherwise, each lane in Western blots received 30 μg of protein. Antigen-antibody complexes were visualized and quantified by using peroxidase-coupled secondary antibodies, an enhanced chemiluminescence procedure, and image analysis software (ImageQuant, GE Healthcare, and ImageJ) as described previously (32Ndubuka C. Kim Y. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7621-7624Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) Signals were recorded on x-ray film. Determination of C. elegans Life Span—C. elegans was grown on agar plates seeded with E. coli OP50 at 20 °C. Animal development was synchronized by standard procedures. When the nematodes reached adulthood, 80–100 animals were placed on fresh plates and were assayed for viability at various intervals. Animals were considered dead when they ceased to move, stopped feeding, and failed to respond to touch with a wire. During the assay nematodes were separated from progeny and transferred to a fresh plate every 24 h. Data were plotted and analyzed with PRISM software (Graphpad). DAF-16-GFP Translocation Assay—A stably integrated transgene, in which DAF-16 promoter/enhancer DNA drives expression of a DAF-16-GFP fusion protein (33Henderson S.T. Kim T.E. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 1975-1980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar), was crossed into WT and dkf-2(pr3) null genetic backgrounds. Animals were incubated at 33 °C for 2 h and then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min. Duplicate batches of WT and mutant animals were maintained at 20 °C and assayed in parallel. Animals were mounted, and subcellular location of DAF-16-GFP was determined by fluorescence microscopy as described previously (17Feng H. Kim M. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 17815-17826Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 27Feng H. Kim M. Wu S.L. Hall D.H. Rubin C.S. J. Biol.

Other Experimental Procedures—Detailed descriptions of PCR amplification and analysis of a partially deleted gene, generation and analysis of transgenic animals, confocal immunofluorescence microscopy, protein determination, and deletion and site-directed mutagenesis are provided in recent papers (17Feng H.

Identification and Characterization of cDNA Encoding DKF-2—A search of the C. elegans genome (in WormBase) identified two genes encoding predicted PKDs. One gene included exons for DKF-1, a previously characterized PKD (27Feng H. Kim M. Wu S.L. Hall D.H. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 17801-17814Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). A second gene, designated T25E12.4a, was distributed over four cosmids (GenBank™ accession numbers Z82052, Z92967, AL021507, and AL021572, respectively) generated by the C. elegans Genome Project. Conceptual transcription, splicing, and translation (Genefinder software) yielded a predicted, full-length (3.7 kbp) cDNA encoding a novel PKD isoform. cDNAs (yk335b9 and yk417d2) potentially encoding PKD were obtained from the C. elegans EST project (Dr. Y. Kohara, National Institute of Genetics, Mishima, Japan). Only minor portions of DNA inserts were characterized previously. Thus, the recombinant DNAs were fully sequenced. Both clones had a 5′-untranslated region (60 bp), an initiator ATG sequence coupled to a long open reading frame (3210 bp), and a 462-bp 3′-untranslated region. The open reading frame encodes a protein composed of 1070 amino acids (Fig. 1A), which was named DKF-2. According to C. elegans nomenclature conventions, mRNA, cDNA, and protein are identified with uppercase lettering (DKF-2); the corresponding gene is named with lowercase italics (dkf-2). Organization of the dkf-2 Gene—Alignment of DKF-2 cDNA sequence with corresponding C. elegans genomic DNA (Wormbase) revealed exon and intron boundaries in the dkf-2 gene. The gene contains 18 exons and spans ∼40-kb of DNA (supplemental Table SI). Structure/Function Relationships in DKF-2—Functions for conserved amino acids in Ser/Thr protein kinases have been established by biochemical analysis, determinations of three-dimensional structures, and mutagenesis (34Hanks S.K.

https://openalex.org/W2075812596,"Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus is associated with two lymphoproliferative disorders, primary effusion lymphoma (PEL) and Castleman disease. In PEL, Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus is present in a latent form expressing only few viral genes. Among them is a viral homologue of cellular interferon regulatory factors, vIRF-3. To study the role of vIRF-3 in PEL lymphomagenesis, we analyzed the interaction of vIRF-3 with cellular proteins. Using yeast two-hybrid screen, we detected the association between vIRF-3 and c-Myc suppressor, MM-1α. The vIRF-3 and MM-1α interaction was also demonstrated by glutathione S-transferase pulldown assay and coimmunoprecipitation of endogenous vIRF-3 and MM-1α in PEL-derived cell lines. Overexpression of vIRF-3 enhanced the c-Myc-dependent transcription of the gene cdk4. Addressing the molecular mechanism of the vIRF-3-mediated stimulation, we demonstrated that the association between MM-1α and c-Myc was inhibited by vIRF-3. Furthermore, the recruitment of vIRF-3 to the cdk4 promoter and the elevated levels of the histone H3 acetylation suggest the direct involvement of vIRF-3 in the activation of c-Myc-mediated transcription. These findings indicate that vIRF-3 can effectively stimulate c-Myc function in PEL cells and consequently contribute to de-regulation of B-cell growth and differentiation.

Inhibition of the IκB kinase kinase activity, and down-modulation of the NFκB-dependent transcription by vIRF-3 have also been reported (11Seo T. Kim J. Lim C. Choe J. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 6146-6155Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Recently, vIRF-3 was shown to interact with 14-3-3 proteins and inhibit FOXO3a transcription factor, which may contribute to cell cycle de-regulation (12Munoz-Fontela C. Kim L. Gallego P. Arroyo J.

KSHV-positive PEL is an aggressive B-cell lymphoma typically growing as lymphomatous effusions in the body cavities without a contiguous tumor mass. In addition to KSHV, some PEL cells also carry the Epstein-Barr virus genome, but are devoid of genetic lesions of c-myc, bcl-2, and p53 (13Carbone A. Kim A.M. Gloghini A. Capello D. Todesco M.

How KSHV contributes to the establishment of the KSHV-associated neoplasia remains to be determined. Proliferation of PEL cells in culture was found to depend on the autocrine production of KSHV-encoded vIL-6, expressed during lytic infection (19Jones K.D. Kim Y. Chang Y. Moore P.S. Yarchoan R. Tosato G. Blood. 1999; 94: 2871-2879Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, because the expression of KSHV in PEL cells is latent, it is assumed that latent genes rather than the genes expressed during the lytic infection may contribute to leukemogenesis. Two of these latent genes, vFLIP and Kaposin, have transforming potential in vitro (20Djerbi M. Kim V. Catrina A.I. Bogen B. Biberfeld P. Grandien A. J. Exp.

Although it has been accepted that lymphomagenesis is a multistep transformation process, a number of genetic changes and infection agents contribute to B-cell lymphoproliferative disorders. c-myc is a proto-oncogene that has been implicated in controlling cellular growth, proliferation, and cell survival (24Grandori C. Kim S.M. James L.P. Eisenman R.N. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 653-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (1040) Google Scholar). It also plays a critical role in the development of B-cell lymphomas (25Keller U.B. Kim J.B. Dorsey F.C. Nilsson J.A. Nilsson L. MacLean K.H. Chung L. Yang C. Spruck C. Boyd K. Reed S.I.

Curr. Mol. Med. 2006; 6: 291-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Overexpression of c-myc, as a consequence of a reciprocal chromosomal exchange involving the immunoglobulin loci, can be seen in Epstein-Barr virus-positive B-cell lymphomas. Expression of c-myc in transgenic mice results in the formation of pre-B-cell lymphoma (28Adams J.M. Kim A.W. Pinkert C.A. Corcoran L.M. Alexander W.S. Cory S. Palmiter R.D. Brinster R.L.

Cell. 1999; 4: 199-207Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar). Thus, overexpression of c-myc may have an important role in lymphoid cell neoplasia. The ability of c-Myc to promote proliferation through cell cycle re-entry seems critical to its oncogenic function. Constitutive expression of c-myc reduces the growth factor requirement, prevents growth arrest, and blocks cellular differentiation (30Alexandrow M.G. Kim M. Aakre M. Moses H.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3239-3243Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 31Hermeking H. Kim J.O. Reichert M. Ellwart J.W. Eick D. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 1409-1415PubMed Google Scholar). The c-myc gene encodes a transcription factor of the basic-helix-loop-helix-leucine zipper family. c-Myc dimerization with another basic-helix-loop-helix-leucine zipper protein, Max, is required for its binding to the specific DNA sequence CACGTG (E-box) and activation of transcription (32Amati B. Kim K. Vlach J. Front. Biosci. 1998; 3: d250-d268Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar, 33Henriksson M. Kim B. Adv. Cancer Res. 1996; 68: 109-182Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Two domains of c-Myc are crucial for its biological activities. The N-terminal domain consists of the transcriptional activation domain, whereas the C-terminal domain mediates DNA binding to promoters of target genes. In recent years, many new C-terminal domain- and N-terminal domain-interacting proteins have been identified (34Sakamuro D. Kim G.C. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 2942-2954Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 35Blackwood E.M. Kim B. Kretzner L. Eisenman R.N. Cold Spring Harb. Symp. Quant. Biol. 1991; 56: 109-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The transcriptional activity of Myc can be repressed by FoxO proteins (36Bouchard C. Kim J. Bras A. Medema R.H. Eilers M. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2830-2840Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar), and by a novel c-Myc repressor, Myc modulator-1 (MM-1). MM-1 binds to the N-terminal domain of c-Myc and suppresses its E-box-dependent transcriptional activity (37Satou A. Kim T. Iguchi-Ariga S.M. Ariga H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46562-46567Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). A mutation of Ala to Arg at amino acid 157 in MM-1, which is frequently observed in patients with leukemia and lymphoma, abrogated the MM-1 suppression activity of c-Myc (38Fujioka Y. Kim T. Maeda Y. Tanaka S. Nishihara H. Iguchi-Ariga S.M. Nagashima K. Ariga H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45137-45144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). MM-1 cDNA was originally identified as a fusion gene derived from sequences on chromosomes 14 and 12 (39Hagio Y. Kim Y. Taira T. Fujioka Y. Iguchi-Ariga S.M. Ariga H. J. Cell. Biochem. 2006; 97: 145-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Of additional isolated MM-1 isoforms (MM-1α, -β, -γ, and -δ), the ubiquitously expressed MM-1α is the most predominant with the strongest suppression activity toward c-Myc (39Hagio Y. Kim Y. Taira T. Fujioka Y. Iguchi-Ariga S.M. Ariga H. J. Cell. Biochem. 2006; 97: 145-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The aim of this study was to analyze a possible role of vIRF-3 in KSHV-associated PEL lymphomas. Using yeast two-hybrid screening, we identified MM-1α as the vIRF-3-interacting protein, and showed that MM-1α is associated with vIRF-3 in PEL cells. The vIRF-3-MM-1α interaction resulted in the release of c-Myc from MM-1α-mediated transcriptional repression. Furthermore, vIRF-3 was tethered to cdk4 and the synthetic E-box-containing promoters through its association with c-Myc. These results suggest a novel mechanism by which KSHV targets the c-Myc-regulated pathways that may inadvertently result in uncontrolled cell growth and transformation. Cell Lines and Culture Conditions—BCBL-1, BC-3, and Daudi cells were grown in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% or 20% (for BC-3 cells) fetal bovine serum. The RAT1 fibroblast subclone TGR-1 (c-myc+/+) and the c-myc–/– derivative, HO15 (kindly provided by Dr. Chi V. Dang, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD), have been previously described (40Mateyak M.K. Kim A.J. Adachi S. Sedivy J.M. Cell Growth & Differ. 1997; 8: 1039-1048PubMed Google Scholar). TGR-1, HO15, and HEK293 cells were grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Plasmids and Antibodies—For the yeast-two hybrid screening, the vIRF-3-C′/pAS2 was cloned by inserting the C-terminal part of vIRF-3 (aa 254–566) between the EcoRI and BamHI sites of pAS2–1 (Clontech Laboratories, Inc., Palo Alto, CA). Full-length vIRF-3 (vIRF-3-FL; aa 1–566), vIRF-3-N′ (aa 1–254), vIRF-3-C′ (aa 254–566) and vIRF-3-GST were described previously (8Lubyova B. Kim P.M. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 8194-8201Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Expression plasmid c-myc-HA and cdk4 reporter constructs, wtMBS1–4, mutMBS1–4, and mut-MBS3 + 4, were kindly provided by Dr. Bert Vogelstein (Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD). The 4XE-box-luc reporter plasmid was kindly provided by Dr. Hiroyoshi Ariga (Hokkaido University, Sapporo, Japan). The T7-MM-1α expression plasmid was cloned by reverse transcription-PCR amplification of MM-1α cDNA using RNA isolated from BCBL-1 cells. The 5′ primer carried a T7 tag sequence that was in-frame with the MM-1α open reading frame. The PCR product was subcloned into pcDNA3.1 vector (Invitrogen). GST-MM-1α-FL (aa 1–154), and its deletion constructs GST-MM-1α-(1–125), -(1–93), -(1–62), -(1–30), -(1–62), and -(63–154) were cloned by amplification of the corresponding region of MM-1α cDNA from the T7-MM-1α expression plasmid and subcloned into pGEX-4T vector (Amersham Biosciences). The fidelity of all constructs was verified on the ABI PRISM™ 377 automated DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). The following antibodies were used: polyclonal antibodies against c-Myc (N 262), p73, IRF-3, actin, and HA (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), T7 monoclonal antibodies (Novagen, EMD Chemicals Inc., San Diego, CA), acetylated-histone 3 antibodies (Upstate Millipore, Billerica, MA), and antibodies against GST (Amersham Biosciences). Production and purification of polyclonal antibodies against vIRF-3 was described previously (9Lubyova B. Kim M.J. Frisancho A.J. Pitha P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 7643-7654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The MM-1α monoclonal antibodies were kindly provided by Dr. Hiroyoshi Ariga. Yeast Two-hybrid Screen—The MATCHMAKER Two-hybrid System 3 was purchased from Clontech Laboratories, Inc. The bait plasmid, vIRF-3-C′/pAS2, and the human leukocyte cDNA library (Clontech Laboratories, Inc.) were introduced into the Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain AH109 using the lithium acetate/heat shock procedure (41Chien C.T. Kim P.L. Sternglanz R. Fields S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9578-9582Crossref PubMed Scopus (1224) Google Scholar). The transformed yeast cells were plated on SD/-Ade/-His/-Leu/-Trp/X-α-gal medium and incubated for 1 week at 30 °C. The interacting cDNA clones were rescued from positive colonies. The sequences of positive cDNA clones were determined on ABI PRISM™ 377 automated DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems) and analyzed using the BLAST program. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blot Analysis—HEK293 cells were co-transfected with vIRF-3, c-myc-HA, and T7-MM-1α expression plasmids using the SuperFect transfection reagent (Qiagen). At 24 h post-transfection, the cells were lysed in co-immunoprecipitation buffer (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.2 mm protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma Co., St. Louis, MO)). The protein extracts (400 μg) were then incubated with the respective antibodies at 4 °C for 1 h, and then 30 μlof protein A/G-Sepharose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.) was added, followed by overnight incubation at 4 °C. Immune complexes were extensively washed with co-immunoprecipitation buffer, and precipitated proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blot. Luciferase Assays—For luciferase assays with HEK293 cells, the cells were seeded in 6-well tissue culture plates 12 h before transfection. Sub-confluent cells were transfected with equal amounts (1 μg) of luciferase reporter and vIRF-3, c-Myc-HA, or T7-MM-1α expression plasmids together with control plasmid pRL-SV40 (0.1 μg, Promega, Madison, WI) using SuperFect transfection reagent (Qiagen). Forty-eight hours after transfection the cells were lysed with the Reporter Lysis Buffer (Promega), and luciferase activity was measured in 20 μl of the lysate using Dual Luciferase Reporter Assay Kit (Promega) as recommended by the manufacturer. Each experiment was repeated three times. The Renilla luciferase activity levels were used to normalize the differences in the transfection efficiency. For luciferase assays with BCBL-1 cells, the procedure was identical except that transfections were done using the Nucleofector transfection device (Amaxa Inc., Gaithersburg, MD). GST Pulldown Assay—In vitro translated proteins were synthesized using the coupled TnT T7 transcription-translation system (Promega) according to the manufacturer’s instruction. GST fusion proteins (0.5 μg) bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads were incubated with 10 μl of the reaction mixture consisting of in vitro translated proteins in 250 μl of binding buffer (10 mm Tris (pH 7.6), 100 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA (pH 8.0), 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 8% glycerol, 0.2 mm protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma)) at 4 °C for 90 min. After three 10-min washes with binding buffer, the proteins bound to the beads were resolved by SDS-PAGE and detected by Western blotting with specific antibodies. For the control of quality and equal loading of GST fusion proteins, the Western blot was re-hybridized with GST antibodies (Amersham Biosciences). Oligonucleotide Pulldown Assay—The DNA pulldown assay was done as previously described (42Au W.C. Kim P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41629-41637Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Briefly, double-stranded oligomers corresponding to the MBS4 in the human cdk4 promoter region (5′-CCCTCAGCGCATGGGTGGCGGTCACGTGCCCAGAACGTCCGG-3′), and tetramerized E-box sequences, 4XE-box (5′-CCCTCAGCGCATGGGTGGCGGTCACGTGCACGTGCACGTGCACGTGCCCAGAACG-3′; E-boxes are underlined), were synthesized and biotin-labeled at the 5′ end of the sense strand and coupled with streptavidin magnetic beads (Dynal, Invitrogen). Whole cell lysates (350 μg) were then incubated with the DNA bound to magnetic beads for 3 h at 4 °C. After extensive washing, the bound proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blot. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation—The assay was performed using a chromatin immunoprecipitation assay kit (Upstate Millipore) following the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, for the endogenous cdk4 promoter studies, BCBL-1 or HEK293 cells (107) were transfected with an empty vector, pcDNA3.1 (control), c-myc-HA-, or vIRF-3 expression plasmids. At 24 h post-transfection, the proteins bound to DNA were cross-linked in the presence of 1% formaldehyde; cells were resuspended in the SDS lysis buffer, followed by sonication. After pre-clearing with salmon sperm DNA/Protein A-agarose (50% slurry), the protein extracts were subjected to immunoprecipitation with antibodies against c-Myc, vIRF-3, or acetylated H3. Immunoprecipitation with antibodies against p73 or IRF-3 was used as a negative control. Immunocomplexes were extensively washed, and the DNA was recovered by phenol/chloroform extraction and resuspended in 50 μl of 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.5). Serial dilutions (1, 5, 10, and 20 μl) were used as template for PCR amplification to show that the response was in the linear rage. Each experiment was repeated three times. PCR amplification was performed with the following cdk4-specific primers: cdk4-FWD, 5-AGTGAGACAATCCTTCAGCCG-3′; cdk4-REV, 5′-GACGTTCTGGGCACGTGAC-3′. The samples were also amplified with GAPDH primers: GAPDH-FWD, 5′-CCCAACTTTCCCGCCTCTC-3′; GAPDH-REV, 5′-CAGCCGCCTGGTTCAACTG-3′, which were used as controls (43Fulmer-Smentek S.B. Kim U. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2001; 10: 645-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Isolation of MM-1α as a vIRF-3-binding Protein in Yeast Two-hybrid Screen—In the search for one or more cellular proteins that may interact with vIRF-3, we employed a yeast two-hybrid system to screen a human leukocyte cDNA library. Initially, we used the full-length vIRF-3 (vIRF-3-FL) as a bait, but the control experiments showed that vIRF-3 may have a strong activation domain, because introduction of the vIRF-3-FL/pAS2 construct into Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain AH109 yielded numerous positive colonies on plates with SD/-Ade/-His/-Leu/-Trp/X-α-gal medium. Therefore, we used the plasmid, vIRF-3-C′/pAS2, encoding only the C-terminal half (aa 254–566) of the vIRF-3 protein. Co-transformation of AH109 yeast cells with the vIRF-3-C′/pAS2 bait and the human leukocyte cDNA library resulted in 42 positive colonies that grew on selection medium lacking Trp, Leu, His, and Ade. 22 of 42 His/Ade-positive transformants formed blue colonies. Plasmids rescued from these positive colonies were analyzed using restriction enzymes, and their inserts were sequenced. One clone, termed C19, contained partial cDNA for human MM-1, which has been previously shown to be a c-Myc-binding protein (44Mori K. Kim Y. Kitaura H. Taira T. Iguchi-Ariga S.M. Ariga H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29794-29800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The cDNA insert of this plasmid encoded the protein ranging from amino acids 17–167 and 4–167 of MM-1 and MM-1α, respectively (Fig. 1A). Because the C19-encoded protein was almost identical to MM-1α, we cloned a T7-tagged MM-1α cDNA from a KSHV-positive PEL cell line, BCBL-1, into pcDNA3.1 vector and used the construct for the experiments described in this study. The originally isolated MM-1 (44Mori K. Kim Y. Kitaura H. Taira T. Iguchi-Ariga S.M. Ariga H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29794-29800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), which represents a fusion gene derived from sequences on chromosome 14 and 12, and the recently identified isoform MM-1α (39Hagio Y. Kim Y. Taira T. Fujioka Y. Iguchi-Ariga S.M. Ariga H. J. Cell. Biochem. 2006; 97: 145-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), share the same properties and functions. Both of them are nuclear proteins that exhibit a strong inhibitory effect on c-Myc-mediated transcription (39Hagio Y. Kim Y. Taira T. Fujioka Y. Iguchi-Ariga S.M. Ariga H. J. Cell. Biochem. 2006; 97: 145-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Specificity of the MM-1α-vIRF-3 Interaction in Vitro and in Vivo—To confirm the results of the yeast two-hybrid assay, we first examined the interaction of vIRF-3 with MM-1α in vitro by a GST pulldown assay and then in vivo by co-immunoprecipitation. The results in Fig. 1B showed that in vitro translated MM-1α bound strongly to the full-length GST-vIRF-3 fusion protein, whereas, it did not interact with GST alone. The in vivo interaction between ectopically expressed vIRF-3 and MM-1α in HEK293 cells was examined by co-immunoprecipitation. As shown in Fig. 1C, T7-tagged MM-1α co-precipitated with transfected vIRF-3 protein. In addition, we detected the interaction between endogenously expressed vIRF-3 and MM-1α proteins in two PEL-derived cell lines, BCBL-1 and BC-3 (Fig. 1D). Co-immunoprecipitation in Daudi cells, which are KSHV-negative and do not express vIRF-3, was used as a negative control. Identification of the MM-1α Interaction Domain—To determine which part of MM-1α protein interacted with vIRF-3, we constructed a series of MM-1α deletion mutants, which were expressed as GST fusion proteins (Fig. 2A). The mobility and purity of these recombinant fusion proteins is shown in Fig. 2B. When used in the GST pulldown assay, all GST-MM-1α deletion mutants were able to bind effectively to the in vitro translated full-length vIRF-3, except the shortest MM-1α-(1–30)-GST and GST alone (Fig. 2C). These results suggest that the MM-1α protein interacted with vIRF-3 through the binding domain that was located in the region between amino acids 31 and 62. To confirm the binding of this peptide to vIRF-3, we constructed the MM-1α (aa 31–62) and MM-1α (aa 63–154) fused to GST and analyzed their ability to interact with vIRF-3 in the GST pulldown assay. The results in Fig. 2D showed that in vitro translated vIRF-3 bound with the same intensities to the MM-1α-FL-GST and MM-1α-(31–62)-GST protein, whereas it did not interact with either MM-1α-(63–154)-GST or GST alone. These data suggest that the interaction between vIRF-3 and MM-1α is direct and that the region between amino acids 31 and 62 of MM-1α protein is its primary interaction domain with vIRF-3. Stimulation of c-Myc Transcriptional Activity by vIRF-3—The ability of c-Myc to promote cell cycle re-entry is in part due to its ability to induce transcription of cdk4 (45Hermeking H. Kim C. Schuhmacher M. Li Q. Barrett J.F. Obaya A.J. O'Connell B.C. Mateyak M.K. Tam W. Kohlhuber F. Dang C.V. Sedivy J.M. Eick D. Vogelstein B. Kinzler K.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 2229-2234Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). The cdk4 gene promoter contains four putative c-Myc binding sites (MBS1–4). Mutation analysis of individual MBS elements suggested that MBS3 and MBS4 were particularly important in the transactivation of cdk4 promoter by c-Myc (45Hermeking H. Kim C. Schuhmacher M. Li Q. Barrett J.F. Obaya A.J. O'Connell B.C. Mateyak M.K. Tam W. Kohlhuber F. Dang C.V. Sedivy J.M. Eick D. Vogelstein B. Kinzler K.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 2229-2234Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). To determine the effect of vIRF-3 on transcriptional activity of c-Myc, we transfected HEK293 cells with c-myc, vIRF-3, and MM-1α expression plasmids together with a reporter construct containing the luciferase gene linked to the wild-type cdk4 promoter, wtMBS1–4. As shown in Fig. 3A, both c-Myc and vIRF-3 activated the cdk4 promoter by ∼2-fold, whereas MM-1α suppressed its activity. In addition, co-transfection of vIRF-3 together with c-myc resulted in further stimulation of cdk4 promoter activity to ∼3.3-fold. Additional co-transfection"
https://openalex.org/W2064223184,"Sex differences have been reported in both overall corpus callosum area and its regional subdivisions in humans. Some have suggested this reflects a unique adaptation in humans, as similar sex differences in corpus callosum morphology have not been reported in any other species of primate examined to date. Furthermore, an association between various measurements of corpus callosum morphology and handedness has been found in humans and chimpanzees. In the current study, we report measurements of corpus callosum cross-sectional area from midsagittal MR images collected in vivo from 14 adult capuchin monkeys, 9 of which were also characterized for hand preference on a coordinated bimanual task. Adult females were found to have a significantly larger corpus callosum: brain volume ratio, rostral body, posterior midbody, isthmus, and splenium than adult males. Left-handed individuals had a larger relative overall corpus callosum area than did right-handed individuals. Additionally, a significant sex and handedness interaction was found for anterior midbody, with right-handed males having a significantly smaller area than right-handed females. These results suggest that sex and handedness influences on corpus callosum morphology are not restricted to Homo sapiens."
https://openalex.org/W2029551683,"More than half of all health care workers (HCWs) in high TB-incidence, low and middle income countries are latently infected with tuberculosis (TB). We determined radiological lesions in a cohort of HCWs with latent TB infection (LTBI) in India, and determined their association with demographic, occupational and T-cell immune response variables.We obtained chest radiographs of HCWs who had undergone tuberculin skin test (TST) and QuantiFERON-TB Gold In Tube (QFT), an interferon-gamma release assay, in a previous cross-sectional study, and were diagnosed to have LTBI because they were positive by either TST or QFT, but had no evidence of clinical disease. Two observers independently interpreted these radiographs using a standardized data form and any discordance between them resolved by a third observer. The radiological diagnostic categories (normal, suggestive of inactive TB, and suggestive of active TB) were compared with results of TST, QFT assay, demographic, and occupational covariates.A total of 330 HCWs with positive TST or QFT underwent standard chest radiography. Of these 330, 113 radiographs (34.2%) were finally classified as normal, 206 (62.4%) had lesions suggestive of inactive TB, and 11 (3.4%) had features suggestive of active TB. The mean TST indurations and interferon-gamma levels in the HCWs in these three categories were not significantly different. None of the demographic or occupational covariates was associated with prevalence of inactive TB lesions on chest radiography.In a high TB incidence setting, nearly two-thirds of HCWs with latent TB infection had abnormal radiographic findings, and these findings had no clear correlation with T cell immune responses. Further studies are needed to verify these findings and to identify the causes and prognosis of radiologic abnormalities in health care workers."
https://openalex.org/W2004677323,"Gene array analysis has been widely used to identify genes induced during T cell activation. Our studies identified an immediate early gene that is strongly induced in response to IL-2 in mouse T cells which we named cysteine- serine-rich nuclear protein-1 (CSRNP-1). The human ortholog was previously identified as an AXIN1 induced gene (AXUD1). The protein does not contain sequence defined domains or motifs annotated in public databases, however the gene is a member of a family of three mammalian genes that share conserved regions, including cysteine- and serine-rich regions and a basic domain, they encode nuclear proteins, possess transcriptional activation domain and bind the sequence AGAGTG. Consequently we propose the nomenclature of CSRNP-1, -2 and -3 for the family. To elucidate the physiological functions of CSRNP-1, -2 and -3, we generated mice deficient for each of these genes by homologous recombination in embryonic stem cells. Although the CSRNP proteins have the hallmark of transcription factors and CSRNP-1 expression is highly induced by IL-2, deletion of the individual genes had no obvious consequences on normal mouse development, hematopoiesis or T cell functions. However, combined deficiencies cause partial neonatal lethality suggesting that the genes have redundant functions."
https://openalex.org/W2134524949,"Background ADP-ribosyl cyclases are remarkable enzymes capable of catalyzing multiple reactions including the synthesis of the novel and potent intracellular calcium mobilizing messengers, cyclic ADP-ribose and NAADP. Not all ADP-ribosyl cyclases however have been characterized at the molecular level. Moreover, those that have are located predominately at the outer cell surface and thus away from their cytosolic substrates. Methodology/Principal Findings Here we report the molecular cloning of a novel expanded family of ADP-ribosyl cyclases from the sea urchin, an extensively used model organism for the study of inositol trisphosphate-independent calcium mobilization. We provide evidence that one of the isoforms (SpARC1) is a soluble protein that is targeted exclusively to the endoplasmic reticulum lumen when heterologously expressed. Catalytic activity of the recombinant protein was readily demonstrable in crude cell homogenates, even under conditions where luminal continuity was maintained. Conclusions/Significance Our data reveal a new intracellular location for ADP-ribosyl cyclases and suggest that production of calcium mobilizing messengers may be compartmentalized."
https://openalex.org/W1995193742,"Background Co-evolution between Plasmodium species and its vectors may result in adaptive changes in genes that are crucial components of the vector's defense against the pathogen. By analyzing which genes show evidence of positive selection in malaria vectors, but not in closely related non-vectors, we can identify genes that are crucial for the mosquito's resistance against Plasmodium. Methodology/Principle Findings We investigated genetic variation of three anti-malarial genes; CEC1, GNBP-B1 and LRIM1, in both vector and non-vector species of the Anopheles gambiae complex. Whereas little protein differentiation was observed between species in CEC1 and GNBP-B1, McDonald-Kreitman and maximum likelihood tests of positive selection show that LRIM1 underwent adaptive evolution in a primary malaria vector; An. arabiensis. In particular, two adjacent codons show clear signs of adaptation by having accumulated three out of four replacement substitutions. Furthermore, our data indicate that this LRIM1 allele has introgressed from An. arabiensis into the other main malaria vector An. gambiae. Conclusions/Significance Although no evidence exists to link the adaptation of LRIM1 to P. falciparum infection, an adaptive response of a known anti-malarial gene in a primary malaria vector is intriguing, and may suggest that this gene could play a role in Plasmodium resistance in An. arabiensis. If so, our data also predicts that LRIM1 alleles in An. gambiae vary in their level of resistance against P. falciparum."
https://openalex.org/W1971887982,"Background The whole blood interferon-gamma assay (QuantiFERON-TB-2G; QFT) has not been fully evaluated as a baseline tuberculosis screening test in Japanese healthcare students commencing clinical contact. The aim of this study was to compare the results from the QFT with those from the tuberculin skin test (TST) in a population deemed to be at a low risk for infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Methodology/Principal Findings Healthcare students recruited at Okayama University received both the TST and the QFT to assess the level of agreement between these two tests. The interleukin-10 levels before and after exposure to M tuberculosis-specific antigens (early-secreted antigenic target 6-kDa protein [ESAT-6] and culture filtrate protein 10 [CFP-10]) were also measured. Of the 536 healthcare students, most of whom had been vaccinated with bacillus-Calmette-Guérin (BCG), 207 (56%) were enrolled in this study. The agreement between the QFT and the TST results was poor, with positive result rates of 1.4% vs. 27.5%, respectively. A multivariate analysis also revealed that the induration diameter of the TST was not affected by the interferon-gamma concentration after exposure to either of the antigens but was influenced by the number of BCG needle scars (p = 0.046). The whole blood interleukin-10 assay revealed that after antigen exposure, the median increases in interleukin-10 concentration was higher in the subgroup with the small increase in interferon-gamma concentration than in the subgroup with the large increase in interferon-gamma concentration (0.3 vs. 0 pg/mL; p = 0.004). Conclusions/Significance As a baseline screening test for low-risk Japanese healthcare students at their course entry, QFT yielded quite discordant results, compared with the TST, probably because of the low specificity of the TST results in the BCG-vaccinated population. We also found, for the first time, that the change in the interleukin-10 level after exposure to specific antigens was inversely associated with that in the interferon-gamma level in a low-risk population."
https://openalex.org/W2050304744,"Class I fructose-1,6-bisphosphate aldolases catalyze the interconversion between the enamine and iminium covalent enzymatic intermediates by stereospecific exchange of the pro(S) proton of the dihydroxyacetone-phosphate C3 carbon, an obligatory reaction step during substrate cleavage. To investigate the mechanism of stereospecific proton exchange, high resolution crystal structures of native and a mutant Lys146 → Met aldolase were solved in complex with dihydroxyacetone phosphate. The structural analysis revealed trapping of the enamine intermediate at Lys229 in native aldolase. Mutation of conserved active site residue Lys146 to Met drastically decreased activity and enabled trapping of the putative iminium intermediate in the crystal structure showing active site attachment by C-terminal residues 360-363. Attachment positions the conserved C-terminal Tyr363 hydroxyl within 2.9Å of the C3 carbon in the iminium in an orientation consistent with incipient re face proton transfer. We propose a catalytic mechanism by which the mobile C-terminal Tyr363 is activated by the iminium phosphate via a structurally conserved water molecule to yield a transient phenate, whose developing negative charge is stabilized by a Lys146 positive charge, and which abstracts the C3 pro(S) proton forming the enamine. An identical C-terminal binding mode observed in the presence of phosphate in the native structure corroborates Tyr363 interaction with Lys146 and is consistent with transient C terminus binding in the enamine. The absence of charge stabilization and of a mobile C-terminal catalyst explains the extraordinary stability of enamine intermediates in transaldolases.

The absence of charge stabilization and of a mobile C-terminal catalyst explains the extraordinary stability of enamine intermediates in transaldolases. Stereospecificity is one of the hallmarks of enzyme catalysis. Aldolases, which are abundant and ubiquitous enzymes, catalyze stereospecific carbon-carbon bond formation, one of the most important transformations in living organisms. Their role is best known in glycolysis where fructose-1,6-bis(phosphate) (FBP) 3The abbreviations used are: FBP, fructose-1,6-bis(phosphate); G3P, d-glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate; DHAP, dihydroxyacetone phosphate; WT, recombinant wild type; DERA, d-2-deoxyribose-5-phosphate aldolase. aldolases (EC 4.1.2.13) promote the cleavage of FBP to triose phosphates, d-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (G3P), and dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP). A common feature to class I enzymes is the use of a covalent mechanism for catalysis implicating iminium (protonated Schiff base) formation between a lysine residue on the enzyme and a ketose substrate (1Grazi E. Rowley P.T. Chang T. Tchola O. Horecker B.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1962; 9: 38-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) that entails stereospecific proton exchange in the covalent intermediate (2Rose I.A. Rieder S.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1958; 231: 315-329Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Of the three aldolase isozymes found in vertebrates (3Penhoet E.E. Rutter W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 318-323Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the catalytic mechanism has been extensively studied using class I aldolase A from rabbit muscle and key intermediates are depicted in reaction Scheme 1. In the condensation direction, the reaction involves covalent intermediate formation with the keto triose phosphate DHAP followed by condensation with the aldehyde G3P to form the ketose of the acyclic FBP substrate (4Rose I.A. Warms J.V. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 3952-3957Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 5Ray B.D. Harper E.T. Fife W.K. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1983; 105: 3731-3732Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar). To form the C3-C4 bond of FBP, the enzyme stereospecifically abstracts the pro(S) C3 proton of the trigonal iminium 1 (6Jencks, W. P. (1969) Catalysis in Chemistry and Enzymology, pp. 120-121, McGraw-Hill Book Co., New YorkGoogle Scholar, 7Grazi E. Cheng T. Horecker B.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1962; 7: 250-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) that is formed from the Michaelis complex with DHAP thereby generating via the enamine 2 (2Rose I.A. Rieder S.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1958; 231: 315-329Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) the carbanionic character at C3 of DHAP for the aldol reaction. The nascent carbon-carbon bond has the same orientation as the pro(S) α-hydrogen initially abstracted from the DHAP imine intermediate. The overall retention of configuration at C3 requires that proton abstraction from 1 to yield the enamine 2 and condensation with aldehyde in 3 must take place from the same direction on the enzyme (8Rose I.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1958; 80: 5835-5836Crossref Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The iminium intermediate formed is then hydrolyzed and FBP is released by the inverse reaction sequence shown in Scheme 1. A distinguishing mechanistic feature of class I aldolases is the relative stability of the iminium 1 and enamine 2 forms, which is a consequence of the catalytic requirements. The enzyme must stabilize the enamine 2 and/or the preceding iminium 1 such that no decomposition occurs prior to reaction with the aldehyde as shown in 3. This stability is reflected in solution where the enzymatic populations 1 and 2 represent 20 and 60%, respectively, of bound DHAP on the muscle enzyme under equilibrium conditions (9Rose I.A. Warms J.V. Kuo D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 692-701Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The interconversion between the two forms implicates the conserved C-terminal Tyr363 residue whose proteolysis inhibits the stereospecific proton exchange step, making it rate-limiting (10Rose I.A. O'Connell E.L. Mehler A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1965; 240: 1758-1765Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas the penultimate residues (357-362) of the C-terminal region modulate the rate of exchange reaction (11Berthiaume L. Tolan D.R. Sygusch J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10826-10835Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The C-terminal region (residues 343-363) is conformationally mobile (12Adelman R.C.

Although a number of structural studies have been performed that have investigated intermediates in class I aldolases (15St-Jean M. Lafrance-Vanasse J. Liotard B. Sygusch J. J. Biol.

Science. 2001; 294: 369-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar), characterization of the interconversion between the iminium and the enamine has so far proven elusive at the structural level. To investigate the mechanism of stereoselective proton transfer in class I aldolases and how the enzyme is able to make efficient use of intermediates that are intrinsically unstable molecules, high resolution crystallographic studies were under-taken of rabbit muscle class I FBP aldolase in complex with DHAP using aldolase crystals incubated in the presence of DHAP in non-acidic buffer (pH 7.5), similar to kinetic studies (9Rose I.A. Warms J.V. Kuo D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 692-701Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Flash freezing of a native rabbit muscle aldolase crystal soaked in a saturating DHAP solution trapped the enamine intermediate. On the other hand, a crystal of the active site mutant Lys146 → Met revealed DHAP bound as the iminium intermediate and interacting with the C-terminal tyrosine in the active site. Attachment by the C-terminal region yielded reaction geometry conducive for incipient proton transfer at the DHAP C3 carbon and explained proton exchange chirality. Purification and Crystallization—Expression and purification of recombinant native (WT) and Lys146 → Met mutant (K146M) rabbit muscle aldolases were performed as described previously (11Berthiaume L.

Aldolase concentration was determined using an extinction coefficient of 0.91 (mg/ml)-1 at 280 nm (20Baranowski T. Niederland T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1949; 180: 543-551Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). WT and K146M aldolases were crystallized using the conditions reported previously (15St-Jean M. Lafrance-Vanasse J. Liotard B. Sygusch J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 27262-27270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Proton Exchange—Stereospecific pro(S) proton exchange at the C3 carbon of DHAP catalyzed by WT and K146M aldolases and WT aldolase crystals was followed by appearance of the tritium isotope label as (S)-[3-3H1]DHAP from tritiated water. Incorporation of the tritiated label at (S)-C3 of DHAP in the presence of [3H]H2O was determined using an ion exchange protocol (Dowex Cl- resin) described in the literature (8Rose I.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1958; 80: 5835-5836Crossref Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Carboxypeptidase A-treated aldolase was prepared according to conditions described previously (10Rose I.A. O'Connell E.L. Mehler A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1965; 240: 1758-1765Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Digestion of aldolase by carboxypeptidase A was monitored by loss of enzymatic activity using a coupled assay and following NADH oxidation at 340 nm (21Racker E. J. Biol. Chem. 1947; 167: 843-854Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The proteolyzed enzyme was separated from carboxypeptidase A by size exclusion chromatography when aldolase activity was decreased to 5% of the original activity. Data Collection and Processing—WT aldolase crystals were soaked either for 2 min in ligand buffer containing DHAP (mother liquor plus 1 mm DHAP) or in phosphate buffer for 5 min (mother liquor plus 20 mm NaH2PO4). A K146M mutant aldolase crystal was soaked for 10 min in a ligand buffer containing a higher concentration of DHAP (mother liquor plus 20 mm DHAP). Prior to data collection, single crystals were cryoprotected in a soaking buffer containing 15% glycerol and immediately flash frozen in a stream of gaseous N2 cooled to 100 K. Data collections were performed at beamline X8-C of the National Synchrotron Light Source (Brookhaven National Laboratory, Upton, NY) and diffracted intensities were measured using a Quantum4 charge-coupled device detector (Area Detector Systems, Poway, CA). All data sets were processed with HKL2000 (22Otwinowski Z. Minor W.

The coordinates and structure factors of WT aldolase soaked with DHAP, WT aldolase soaked with inorganic phosphate (Pi), and K146M aldolase soaked with DHAP have been deposited with the Protein Data Bank (codes 2QUT, 2QUV, and 2QUU, respectively). The final structure models have Rcryst (Rfree) values of 0.159 (0.191), 0.144 (0.191), and 0.157 (0.195), respectively. The corresponding positional errors in atomic coordinates using Luzzati plots were estimated at 0.17, 0.18, and 0.18 Å, respectively. Errors in hydrogen bond distances and positional differences are reported as standard deviations and were estimated based on their value in each subunit of the aldolase homotetramers unless specified otherwise. All figures were prepared using the program PyMOL (27DeLano W.L. The PyMOL Molecular Graphics System. DeLano Scientific LLC, San Carlos, CA2004Google Scholar). Superpositions were performed also with the program PyMOL overlaying Cα atom coordinates of aldolase residues 158-259 that are invariant to binding events as noted previously (15St-Jean M. Lafrance-Vanasse J. Liotard B. Sygusch J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 27262-27270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Chemical identity of covalent intermediates trapped in the WT-DHAP and K146M-DHAP structures was selected from simulated annealing Fo - Fc omit maps using the real space statistic, Rfact, calculated in O (RS_FIT command). The statistic assesses the fit of Lys229 Cϵ and Nζ atoms and DHAP C1, C2, C3, and O3 atoms in enamine and iminium forms to the electron density. In the enamine, Lys229 Nζ would be sp3 hybridized, whereas in the iminium, the hybridization would be sp2. The discrimination of this difference in hybridization between the iminium and the enamine was quantified using a paired Student's t test comparing pairwise Rfact statistics for identical subunits having the bound DHAP refined as either iminium or enamine form. Enamine Intermediate—Flash freezing of a WT aldolase crystal in the presence of DHAP trapped a covalent intermediate in each aldolase subunit. Continuous electron density, extending beyond Lys229 Nζ in each subunit, shown in Fig. 1, indicates formation of a stable covalent adduct with DHAP. The planar shape of the electron density observed about the DHAP C2 carbon indicates trigonal hybridization, whereas non-planar shape of the electron density about the Lys229 Nζ atom suggests tetrahedral hybridization and is consistent with trapping of a cis-enamine intermediate in each aldolase subunit (Fig. 2A). Comparison of average B-factors between bound DHAP and interacting side chains, 24 ± 3 and 21 ± 3 Å2, respectively, indicates full active site occupancy by DHAP. To validate the electron density interpretation, real space Rfact was evaluated (24Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A Found. Crystallogr. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13011) Google Scholar) to objectively assess model fit to the electron density. The resulting paired Student's t test statistic calculated based on Rfact values for DHAP modeled as either an enamine or an iminium was discriminatory with p = 0.042, the enamine having consistently lower Rfact values in all subunits. This distinction is statistically significant and confirms trapping of a genuine enamine intermediate. Proton exchange in WT aldolase crystals as measured by production of (S)-[3-3H1]DHAP (Table 2) indicates 10 turnovers within the 2-min soaking period of DHAP into the aldolase crystal and corroborates equilibrium trapping of an enamine intermediate in all subunits. Coplanarity of DHAP C1, C2, C3, and O3 atoms, a requisite structural feature in the enamine intermediate, further supports identification of the intermediate as the enamine.FIGURE 2Discrimination of enzymatic intermediates formed with DHAP in aldolase active site. Geometry of enzymatic intermediates was used to identify the chemical entity of the trapped DHAP-aldolase complexes. A, an enamine intermediate was identified in all subunits in the structure of native aldolase on the basis of sp3 hybridization of Lys229 Nζ and enables hydrogen bond formation between the Ser300 hydroxyl and Lys229 Nζ. Difference electron density shown was calculated as described in the legend to Fig. 1 and contoured at 4.0σ. B, an iminium intermediate was identified in all subunits in the structure of the K146M mutant aldolase complexed with DHAP. sp2 hybridization of Lys229 Nζ precludes hydrogen bond formation with Ser300.

These interactions are identical to those reported in the structure of the iminium intermediate formed with FBP substrate by the same enzyme (15St-Jean M. Lafrance-Vanasse J. Liotard B. Sygusch J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 27262-27270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) including an unusual short hydrogen bond (2.4 ± 0.1 Å) with Ser271 side chain. Asp33 and Lys146 further stabilize the intermediate by hydrogen bonding with DHAP C3 hydroxyl and on the basis of consistency with the hydrogen bonding pattern, Lys146 is protonated. An additional hydrogen bond between Ser300 hydroxyl and Lys229 Nζ specifically stabilizes the enamine intermediate (Fig. 2A), which is not possible in the carbanion or the iminium requiring sp2 hybridization at Lys229 Nζ. Stabilization of the enamine by the hydrogen bond is reflected in the reduced pro(S) proton exchange rate at C3 of DHAP when measured for mutations Ser300 to Ala and Cys and compared with native enzyme (28Munger C.

Elimination of hydrogen bonding potential in mutation S300A yielded a 5-fold reduction in exchange rate, whereas weakening the same hydrogen bond in mutation S300C reduced the rate 3-fold. Active site binding of DHAP induces identical conformational changes in each aldolase subunit with respect to native enzyme that results in the asymmetric narrowing of the active site cleft, similar to the conformational change observed in the structure of the iminium intermediate formed with FBP (15St-Jean M.

From Table 3, conformational displacements of these helical regions, although smaller than for the FBP bound structure, are significant when compared with residues 158-259 of the β-barrel, which make up part of the active site and inter-subunit contacts.TABLE 3Conformational changes induced by DHAP bindingResidues selectedWT-DHAPWT-FBPaProtein Data Bank code 1ZAI (15).158-2590.090.0933-65bCalculation of root mean square differences for these residues was based on superposition of liganded complexes onto native enzyme using Cα atom coordinates of residues 158-259.0.721.02302-329bCalculation of root mean square differences for these residues was based on superposition of liganded complexes onto native enzyme using Cα atom coordinates of residues 158-259.0.660.8435bCalculation of root mean square differences for these residues was based on superposition of liganded complexes onto native enzyme using Cα atom coordinates of residues 158-259.0.661.2538bCalculation of root mean square differences for these residues was based on superposition of liganded complexes onto native enzyme using Cα atom coordinates of residues 158-259.0.300.62303bCalculation of root mean square differences for these residues was based on superposition of liganded complexes onto native enzyme using Cα atom coordinates of residues 158-259.0.700.74a Protein Data Bank code 1ZAI (15St-Jean M.

Open table in a new tab Superposition of the native and enamine-bound structures identified two conserved water molecules, W1 and W2, whose positions remain invariant upon DHAP attachment (Fig. 1). W1 that has a low B-factor (23 ± 4Å2), similar to that of Cα atoms of residues 10-343 (20 ± 8Å2), is positioned by hydrogen bonds with Glu187 and W2, at 3.1 ± 0.1 Å from both DHAP C2 and C3 carbons. The orientation of W1 is perpendicular to the enamine plane and more in line with the DHAP C2 carbon. A similar in line geometry with the C3 carbon position would require only a slight positional displacement by the water molecule. Phosphate Binding—Phosphate anion binding to aldolase is inhibited by DHAP (29Ginsburg A. Mehler A.H. Biochemistry. 1966; 5: 2623-2634Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) indicating competition for the P1 phosphate binding site. To address the specificity of the induced conformational changes in stabilization of the enamine intermediate, a WT aldolase crystal was soaked in a phosphate buffer. Structural analysis revealed subunit heterogeneity in response to phosphate binding with respect to the extent of asymmetric narrowing of the active site cleft and binding specificity was controlled by active site attachment of C-terminal residues 360-363. In one subunit (D), phosphate anion binding coincides with the DHAP P1 phosphate site in the enamine structure and concomitant with the C terminus occluding the active site (Fig. 3). The conformational changes induced by phosphate bound at the P1 phosphate binding site were greatest in this subunit and comparable with those induced by DHAP with respect to the native enzyme. In addition, Ser38 from the helical region 33-65 was displaced by 0.6 Å along the helical axis to avoid close contact with Tyr363 in the active site. An additional partially occupied phosphate binding site was found at the subunit interface and interacting with residues Gln202, Arg258, and Lys12, the latter from an adjacent subunit. In two other subunits (A and C), the phosphate anion binding site is shifted ∼2 Å from the previous DHAP P1 phosphate binding locus toward the surface of the active site (not shown). Binding at this site does not involve active site attachment by the C terminus region nor significant conformational changes and is of lower affinity as phosphate positions refined to partial occupancy. The C-terminal regions are fully bound at their proper subunit interface as in the enamine structure and C terminus Tyr363 interacts with the same residues involved in phosphate binding as those implicated at the subunit interface of D.

Here, we investigated promoter elements and mechanisms of androgen receptor (AR)-mediated regulation of the versican gene in prostate cancer cells. Using transient transfection assays in prostate cancer LNCaP and cervical cancer HeLa cells engineered to express the AR, we demonstrate that the synthetic androgen R1881 and dihydrotestosterone stimulate expression of a versican promoter-driven luciferase reporter vector (versican-Luc). Further, both basal and androgen-stimulated versican-Luc activities were significantly diminished in LNCaP cells, when AR gene expression was knocked down using a short hairpin RNA. Methylation-protection footprinting analysis revealed an AR-protected element between positions +75 and +102 of the proximal versican promoter, which strongly resembled a consensus steroid receptor element. Electrophoretic mobility shift and supershift assays revealed strong and specific binding of the recombinant AR DNA binding domain to oligonucleotides corresponding to this protected DNA sequence. Site-directed mutagenesis of the steroid receptor element site markedly diminished R1881-stimulated versican-Luc activity. In contrast to the response seen using LNCaP cells, R1881 did not significantly induce versican promoter activity and mRNA levels in AR-positive prostate stromal fibroblasts. Interestingly, overexpression of β-catenin in the presence of androgen augmented versican promoter activity 10- and 30-fold and enhanced versican mRNA levels 2.8-fold in fibroblasts. In conclusion, we demonstrate that AR transactivates versican expression, which may augment tumor-stromal interactions and may contribute to prostate cancer progression.

Current findings obtained through a variety of approaches increasingly point to the contribution of stromal components to oncogenic signals that mediate both phenotypic and genomic changes in epithelial cells (6Tlsty T.D.

Versican is highly expressed in many malignancies, including prostate cancers (21Ricciardelli C. Kim K. Sykes P.J. Raymond W.A. McCaul K. Marshall V.R. Horsfall D.J. Clin. Cancer Res. 1998; 4: 963-971PubMed Google Scholar). Recent studies demonstrated that prostate cells from tumor and benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) tissues induce host stromal cells to accumulate versican levels via a paracrine mechanism (22Sakko A.J. Kim C. Mayne K. Tilley W.D. Lebaron R.G. Horsfall D.J. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 926-930PubMed Google Scholar, 23Cross N.A. Kim S. Jokonya N. Fowles A. Hamdy F.C. Buttle D.J. Eaton C.L. Prostate. 2005; 63: 269-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Further, versican has been shown to be an important modulator of tumor cell attachment to the interstitial stromal matrix of the prostate, a factor likely important in cancer cell motility and local invasion of the prostatic stroma (24Sakko A.J. Kim C. Mayne K. Suwiwat S. LeBaron R.G. Marshall V.R. Tilley W.D. Horsfall D.J. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 4786-4791PubMed Google Scholar). As well it has been suggested that versican may be a useful marker of disease progression in patients with early-stage prostate cancer (21Ricciardelli C. Kim K. Sykes P.J. Raymond W.A. McCaul K. Marshall V.R. Horsfall D.J. Clin. Cancer Res. 1998; 4: 963-971PubMed Google Scholar).Genes that are preferentially expressed in human prostate tissues are often regulated by androgens at the transcriptional level. The androgen testosterone, and the more potent form dihydrotestosterone (DHT), bind to and activate the androgen receptor (AR). Upon ligand activation, the AR is phosphorylated and forms a homodimer that is transported to the nucleus where it activates transcription by binding to androgen-response elements (AREs) in promoter and enhancer regions of target genes (25Heinlein C.A. Kim C. Endocr. Rev. 2004; 25: 276-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (1277) Google Scholar). Androgen withdrawal is the most effective form of systemic therapy for men with advanced prostate cancer, producing symptomatic and/or objective responses in >80% of patients (26Hamdy N.A. Kim S.E. Semin. Nucl. Med. 2001; 31: 62-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Unfortunately, androgen-independent (AI) progression is inevitable, and with the development of hormone-refractory disease, death occurs within 2–3 years (26Hamdy N.A. Kim S.E. Semin. Nucl. Med. 2001; 31: 62-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). AI progression is a multifactorial process by which cells acquire the ability to both survive in the absence of androgens and proliferate using non-androgenic stimuli for mitogenesis. It probably involves variable combinations of several processes, including adaptive up-regulation of antiapoptotic genes, ligand-independent activation of the AR, and alternative signaling pathways. The elucidation of the mechanisms that mediate AI progression, including key cytoprotective molecules, is an important step toward identifying new targets for therapy.Several lines of evidence indicate that β-catenin is important in the progression of prostate cancer. Cre-mediated excision of the β-catenin (exon3) regulatory domain leads to prostatic hyperplasia and transdifferentiation in mice at 18 weeks of age but without metastatic behavior (27Bierie B. Kim M. Renou J.P. Shillingford J.M. Morgan F. Oka T. Taketo M.M. Cardiff R.D. Miyoshi K. Wagner K.U. Robinson G.W. Hennighausen L. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 3875-3887Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). In a similar model, stabilized β-catenin appears to be important for the initiation of prostatic neoplastic lesions the precursor to invasive carcinoma (28Gounari F. Kim S. Bronson R. Klein L. Sellers W.R. Kum J. Siermann A. Taketo M.M. von Boehmer H. Khazaie K. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 4099-4107Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Also, gain-of-function, truncated forms of β-catenin occurring in metastatic prostate and breast specimens have been shown to preferentially locate to the nucleus, possibly serving as an additional “pool” of β-catenin to promote cell proliferation during the AI phenotype (29Rios-Doria J. Kim R. Ethier S.P. Day M.L. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 7237-7240Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). AR and β-catenin interact by direct binding and complexing, as ascertained by yeast two-hybrid analysis (30Song L.N. Kim R. Byers S. Shah S. Wilson E.M. Gelmann E.P. Mol. Cell.

Despite the importance of versican in prostate cancer, the function and regulation of expression of this versatile molecule in vitro and in vivo is unknown. Our results, for the first time, indicate that versican is transcriptionally regulated by androgens in AR-positive human prostate epithelial and stromal cancer cells. Further, we show a strong and specific binding of recombinant AR to the DNA sequences located in the +75 region of the proximal human versican promoter. Using transient transfection of synthetic reporter and endogenous gene reporter constructs in prostate stromal fibroblasts, we demonstrated that β-catenin is required for AR-mediated transcription in both ligand-dependent and ligand-independent manner in prostate stromal fibroblast cells. These data identify a novel role for β-catenin in nuclear hormone receptor-mediated transcription in prostate stromal cells.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESTissue Culture—HeLa cells, modified HeLa-FLAG-AR-overexpressing cells (a gift of M. Carey, UCLA, Los Angeles, CA), and human prostate stromal fibroblast cell line WPMY-1 (Invitrogen) were maintained in DMEM (Invitrogen), whereas the LNCaP cell line (human prostate cancer cells) was maintained in RPMI (Invitrogen). Both types of media were supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) and 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin. For androgen withdrawal experiments, media was instead supplemented with 10% charcoal-stripped serum (CSS) and 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin for at least 24 h prior to harvesting of cells.Oligonucleotides—Oligonucleotides were synthesized by Nucleic Acids Protein Services (University of British Columbia). Oligonucleotide numberings for steroid response element (SRE)-2 are relative to the transcription start site of the human versican gene. The sequences of the oligonucleotides were: SRE-2 forward, CGAGAACATTAGGTGTTGT; and SRE-2 reverse, ACAACACCTAATGTTCTCG.Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—Individual SRE-2 oligonucleotides were subjected to EMSA as previously described (34Yeung L.H. Kim J.T. Sorenson P. Nelson C.C. Gleave M. Jia W. Rennie P.S. Biochem. J. 2003; 371: 843-855Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Nuclear extracts used in EMSA were isolated from HeLa and HeLa-FLAG-AR cells using a modified Dignam method (35Dignam J.D. Kim R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9142) Google Scholar). For EMSA experiments, 10,000 cpm of labeled oligoduplex probes were added to 18 μg of nuclear extracts. For supershift experiments 2 μg of rabbit anti-AR polyclonal antibody (2 μg/μl, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), 2 μg of rabbit anti-AR monoclonal antibody (2 μg/μl, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or rabbit anti-FLAG polyclonal antibody (2 μg/μl, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were added to the binding reaction, and the mixture was incubated for 30 min on ice prior to electrophoresis.Probe Generation for DMS in Vitro Footprinting—The 764-bp proximal versican promoter was excised from the pGL-3 backbone by digestion with MluI and BglII. The DNA region of interest was radiolabeled by Klenow enzyme labeling using [α-32P]deoxyadenine and deoxycytidine triphosphate. The labeled promoter fragment was then digested with PflMI to give single end-labeled fragments of 426 and 338 bp (referred to as Versican1 and Versican2), respectively. These fragments were separated from each other using a 5% polyacrylamide, 0.5× TBE (0.089 m Tris, 0.089 m boric acid, 0.002 m EDTA) nondenaturing gel. Probes were then cut out of the gel, eluted in 500μl of elution buffer, and ethanol precipitated to generate a single end-labeled probe for DMS footprinting.DMS in Vitro Footprinting: Methylation Protection Analysis—Footprinting reactions were carried out on the Versican1 or Versican2 probes using 5–10 μg(∼3 μg/μl) of His-AR-DBD as described previously (34Yeung L.H. Kim J.T. Sorenson P. Nelson C.C. Gleave M. Jia W. Rennie P.S. Biochem. J. 2003; 371: 843-855Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Western Blotting—Protein samples were boiled in Laemmli sample buffer and resolved by SDS-PAGE electrophoresis. Proteins were then transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The membrane was blocked with 5% nonfat milk in TBST (0.05% Tween 20 in phosphate-buffered saline) for 1 h and then incubated for 1–2 h at room temperature with primary AR antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). Detection was achieved with anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and ECL Western blotting detection agents (Amersham Biosciences, RPN 2106).Plasmid Construction—The reporter plasmid used for transfections was the versican-Luc plasmid, which contains the firefly luciferase gene under the transcriptional control of the–632 to +118 fragment of the human versican promoter (36Rahmani M. Kim J.T. Carthy J.M. McDonald P.C. Wong B.W. Esfandiarei M. Si X. Luo Z. Luo H. Rennie P.S. McManus B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 13019-13028Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The pRL-TK (Promega) Renilla luciferase reporter plasmid was used as an internal transfection control. A dominant stable β-catenin construct was a kind gift of B. Gumbiner (Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY). The expression vector harboring the wild-type human TCF-4 gene was a gift from A. Hecht (Max-Planck-Institute of Immunobiology, Freiburg, Germany). β-Catenin/TCF luciferase reporter constructs pTOPflashx8, which has eight tandem TCF binding sites, was used for assaying TCF transcriptional activity (a gift of R. T. Moon University of Washington, Seattle, WA).Short Hairpin RNA against AR—We recently reported the generation and cloning of short hairpin RNA (shRNA) against AR (37Cheng H. Kim R. Ghaidi F. Cox M.E. Rennie P.S. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 10613-10620Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). In brief, the pSHAG-1-tet plasmid (gift from A. Mui, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada) used to clone the shRNA was modified from pSHAG-1 (gift from G. Hannon, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY). The following sequence was found to have the greatest attenuating effect on AR expression: 5′-GAAAGCACTGCTACTCTTCAGCATTATTCCA-3′ (3539–3569). A scrambled sequence (5′-CCGTACCTACACGCAGCGCTGACAACAGTTT-3′) was used as a negative control. Equal molar amounts of both forward and reverse complimentary oligonucleotides were annealed, kinase-treated, and cloned into pSHAG-1-tet plasmid.Transfections and Luciferase Assay—HeLa and HeLa-FLAG-AR cells were plated in 6-well plates (3.0 × 105 cells per well) in DMEM with 5% fetal bovine serum for 2 days or until reaching 50–60% confluency. Each well was transfected with 2.0 μg of versican-Luc reporter plasmid and 0.2 μg of pRL-TK (Promega, Madison, WI) for purposes of normalization. Plasmid DNA was mixed with of Lipofectin reagent at a ratio of 2 μg of DNA/3 μl of Lipofectin (Invitrogen) in serum-free DMEM, and the mixture was incubated for 30 min at room temperature. Cells were incubated with the transfection mix for 16 h following which transfection medium was replaced by DMEM supplemented with 5% CSS and the appropriate concentration of steroid. LNCaP cells were plated in 6-well plates (3.0 × 105 cells per well) in RPMI with 5% fetal bovine serum for 2 days or until reaching 50–60% confluency. Each well was transfected with 1.0 μg of AR shRNA vector or the scramble control, 1.0 μgof versican-Luc reporter plasmid, and 0.2 μg of pRL-TK (Promega) for purposes of normalization. Plasmid DNA was mixed with of Lipofectin reagent at a ratio of 2 μg of DNA/3 μlof Lipofectin (Invitrogen) in serum-free RPMI, and the mixture was incubated for 30 min at room temperature. Cells were incubated with the transfection mix for 16 h following which transfection medium was replaced by RPMI with 5% CSS with 10 nm R1881, and cells were collected after 24 h of incubation using passive cell lysis buffer (Promega). To inhibit AR expression, LNCaP cells were seeded at a density of 3 × 105 per well in a six-well plate and cotransfected the following day using Lipofectin reagent (Invitrogen) with versican-Luc and either shRNA to AR or scrambled sequence in pSHAG-1-tet. After 24 h, the medium was replaced with RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen) containing 5% CSS (HyClone, West Chester, PA) supplemented with 1 nm synthetic androgen (R1881). Luciferase activities were measured using a commercial kit from Promega according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Luciferase activities were measured as luminescent units/min and normalized to Renilla control values. All transfection experiments were carried out in 3–6 replicates.RNA Extraction, cDNA Synthesis, and RT-PCR—Total RNA was isolated from treated and untreated human prostate stromal fibroblast cell line WPMY-1 using the RNeasy Mini Kit according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Qiagen). All preparations were treated with RNase-free DNase (Qiagen) to remove genomic DNA. 0.5–1 μg of RNA was reverse-transcribed in a total volume of 20 μl in the presence of 200 units of SuperScript RNase H-Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen), 40 units of RNaseOUT recombinant ribonuclease inhibitor (Invitrogen), and 0.5 μg of Oligo(dT) Primer (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Conventional PCR was performed using primers specific for the human versican and β-actin genes and 2 μl of the synthesized cDNA strand. Specific primers for versican were synthesized by Sigma-Genosys: sense, 5′-GCACAAAATTTCACCCTGAC-3′; antisense, 5′-GCACTGGATCTGTTTCTTCA-3′. The samples were amplified in a thermal cycler for 35 cycles, consisting of 1 min of denaturation at 95 °C, 1 min of annealing at 54 °C, and 1 min of extension at 72 °C.Data Base Analyses—The versican proximal promoter was searched against the MatInspector (38Quandt K. Kim K. Karas H. Wingender E. Werner T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4878-4884Crossref PubMed Scopus (2421) Google Scholar) and ConSite (39Sandelin A. Kim W.W. Lenhard B. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: W249-W252Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar) databases to detect potential SRE sites.Statistical Analysis—Significant differences between experimental groups were determined using the Student’s t test. Results for cell culture data are expressed as means ± S.E. Calculated p values were two-sided, and those <0.05 were considered statistically significant.RESULTSVersican Proximal Promoter Luciferase Reporter Vector Responds to Steroid Stimulation—The versican-Luc vector, in which expression of the luciferase gene is under the control of the versican proximal promoter (–634 to +118 relative to the transcriptional start site), was used in transient transfection assays to determine the effects of steroid stimulation on versican promoter activity (36Rahmani M. Kim J.T. Carthy J.M. McDonald P.C. Wong B.W. Esfandiarei M. Si X. Luo Z. Luo H. Rennie P.S. McManus B.M. J. Biol.

Versican-Luc transfected into LNCaP prostate cancer cells responded to the addition of a potent synthetic androgen (10 nm R1881) with an ∼3-fold induction of luciferase expression while exposure of the cells to 10 nm dexamethasone, a glucocorticoid receptor agonist, provoked a ∼2-fold increase in versican-Luc activity (Fig. 1A). Parallel transfections of versican-Luc into HeLa-FLAG-AR and wild-type HeLa cells were used to assess the dose response of the reporter to the natural androgen DHT. Versican-Luc responded with increasing activity across a range of DHT concentrations from 0 to 10 nm in HeLa-FLAG-AR cells while failing to respond in wild-type HeLa cells lacking AR (Fig. 1B). Taken together these results demonstrate androgen-mediated regulation of the versican promoter.Database Searches Reveal Two Potential SRE Candidates within the Versican Proximal Promoter—To determine whether known nuclear receptor transcription factors are able to bind to the proximal versican promoter, the–634 to +118 bp of the human versican promoter sequence (Fig. 2A) was submitted to the MatInspector (38Quandt K. Kim K. Karas H. Wingender E. Werner T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4878-4884Crossref PubMed Scopus (2421) Google Scholar) and ConSite (39Sandelin A. Kim W.W. Lenhard B. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: W249-W252Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar) databases to identify potential protein binding sites. Results suggested that the submitted sequence contained two potential SREs (Fig. 2B). SRE-1 (–392 to–373 bp) showed most sequence similarity to a glucocorticoid response element, whereas SRE-2 (+83 to +102 bp) most resembled a progesterone response element, although there is considerable overlap in the SRE family of recognition sequences, and both sites showed sequence similarity to the consensus ARE. Although the SRE-2 is located within exon 1 of the versican coding sequence, functional AREs within the coding regions of other genes have previously been reported (40Haelens A. Kim G. Callewaert L.

https://openalex.org/W2135799999,"The silencing of one parental set of rRNA genes in a genetic hybrid is an epigenetic phenomenon known as nucleolar dominance. We showed previously that silencing is restricted to the nucleolus organizer regions (NORs), the loci where rRNA genes are tandemly arrayed, and does not spread to or from neighboring protein-coding genes. One hypothesis is that nucleolar dominance is the net result of hundreds of silencing events acting one rRNA gene at a time. A prediction of this hypothesis is that rRNA gene silencing should occur independent of chromosomal location. An alternative hypothesis is that the regulatory unit in nucleolar dominance is the NOR, rather than each individual rRNA gene, in which case NOR localization may be essential for rRNA gene silencing. To test these alternative hypotheses, we examined the fates of rRNA transgenes integrated at ectopic locations. The transgenes were accurately transcribed in all independent transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana lines tested, indicating that NOR localization is not required for rRNA gene expression. Upon crossing the transgenic A. thaliana lines as ovule parents with A. lyrata to form F1 hybrids, a new system for the study of nucleolar dominance, the endogenous rRNA genes located within the A. thaliana NORs are silenced. However, rRNA transgenes escaped silencing in multiple independent hybrids. Collectively, our data suggest that rRNA gene activation can occur in a gene-autonomous fashion, independent of chromosomal location, whereas rRNA gene silencing in nucleolar dominance is locus-dependent."
https://openalex.org/W2075081688,"Background Cellular immunity plays a key role in determining the outcome of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, although the majority of infections become persistent. The mechanisms behind persistence are still not clear; however, the primary site of infection, the liver, may be critical. We investigated the ability of CD8+ T-cells (CTL) to recognise and kill hepatocytes under cytokine stimulation. Methods/Principle Findings Resting hepatocytes cell lines expressed low levels of MHC Class I, but remained susceptible to CTL cytotoxicity. IFN-α treatment, in vitro, markedly increased hepatocyte MHC Class I expression, however, reduced sensitivity to CTL cytotoxicity. IFN-α stimulated hepatocyte lines were still able to present antigen and induce IFN-γ expression in interacting CTL. Resistance to killing was not due to the inhibition of the FASL/FAS- pathway, as stimulated hepatocytes were still susceptible to FAS-mediated apoptosis. In vitro stimulation with IFN-α, or the introduction of a subgenomic HCV replicon into the HepG2 line, upregulated the expression of the granzyme-B inhibitor–proteinase inhibitor 9 (PI-9). PI-9 expression was also observed in liver tissue biopsies from patients with chronic HCV infection. Conclusion/Significance IFN-α induces resistance in hepatocytes to perforin/granzyme mediate CTL killing pathways. One possible mechanism could be through the expression of the PI-9. Hindrance of CTL cytotoxicity could contribute to the chronicity of hepatic viral infections."
https://openalex.org/W2052032108,"The high affinity immunoglobulin E receptor (FcϵRI) complex is dedicated to immunoglobulin E-mediated allergic responses. Expression of the FcϵRI receptor is thought to be relatively stable and limited to mast cells, basophils, eosinophils, monocytes, Langerhans cells, platelets, and neutrophils.

This event is essential for a broad range of events including immediate induction of signaling cascades leading to degranulation, which releases stored mediators including histamine, serotonin, and proteases, and increases the production of arachidonic acid. This results in the generation of symptoms characteristic of acute allergic reaction (1Kinet J.P. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1999; 11: 603-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 2Turner H.

The subsequent late phase reaction is associated with secretion of immunoregulatory cytokines and chemokines leading to an influx of T-cells, monocytes, and eosinophils to the target tissue (5Blank U.

Allergy Asthma Rep. 2004; 4: 263-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). FcϵRI is a multimeric receptor composed of α-chain, β-chain, and γ-homodimer (αβγ2) or α-chain and γ-homodimer (αγ2) (4Rivera J. Curr. Opin.

The extracellular portion of α-subunit binds IgE molecules via the Fc domain. The β- and γ-subunits are not involved directly in IgE binding but are essential for membrane localization and signal transduction in that domains of both subunits are exposed to the cytoplasm (7Nadler M.J. Matthews S.A. Turner H. Kinet J.P. Adv. Immunol. 2000; 76: 325-355Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Signaling is triggered by the simultaneous binding of a single multivalent allergen to multiple IgE·FcR complexes leading to immunogen-induced cross-linking of the receptor on the cell surface. Tetrameric (αβγ2) and trimeric (αγ2) complexes are known to be active (7Nadler M.J. Matthews S.A. Turner H. Kinet J.P. Adv. Immunol. 2000; 76: 325-355Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Expression of FcϵRI was originally thought to be limited to the effector cells of anaphylaxis, specifically mast cells and basophils. Later, it became apparent that the FcϵRI is expressed in antigen-presenting cells including human epidermal Langerhan cells, peripheral blood dendritic cells, monocytes, and eosinophils (7Nadler M.J.

The results presented in this report reflect a surprising observation made during the course of a preliminary microarray analysis of gene expression in the pineal gland, a tissue not known to be involved in the immune response. This tissue is recognized as being dedicated to the generation of the daily rhythm in circulating melatonin, a conserved feature of vertebrate biology (9Maronde E. Stehle J.H. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2007; 18: 142-149Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Our microarray results were surprising because they suggested that there is a daily rhythm in Fcer1a expression in the pineal gland and that nighttime levels are higher than in other tissues. This was especially intriguing when viewed against the evidence of highly restricted expression of FcϵRI and our current concept of the pineal gland as a melatonin factory. The potential importance of this discovery propelled us to confirm the preliminary finding of a 24-hour rhythm in Fcer1a mRNA and to extend this with the intention of obtaining a better understanding of FcϵRI biology in the pineal gland. Our findings provide justification to consider that FcϵRI might provide a unique molecular link between the neuroendocrine and immune systems. Animals and Tissue Removal—Sprague-Dawley rats (Taconic Farms Inc., Germantown, NY) were used for all experiments. Animals were housed in a controlled lighting environment (14-h light and 10-h dark cycles, and for in situ hybridization studies light/dark 12:12). In experiments presented in Fig. 5A, animals were kept under constant darkness or constant light for 3 days. Surgical decentralization of the superior cervical ganglia (SCGdcn, Taconic Farms Inc.) was performed. Rats were allowed to recover and adjust to the light cycle for 2 weeks and then were sacrificed by CO2 asphyxiation and decapitated at the indicated zeitgeber time (ZT). During the dark period, animals were handled under red photographic safelights. Pineal glands and other tissues were removed immediately and frozen on dry ice. All procedures were done in accordance with National Institutes of Health animal use and care guidelines. For in situ hybridization studies, Wistar rats were used. Animals (Animal Section, Panum Institute, Copenhagen, Denmark) were housed for 2 weeks in a controlled lighting environment (12-h light and 12-h dark cycles). As indicated in Fig. 6A, animals were injected intraperitoneally with isoproterenol (ISO, 10 mg/ml phosphate-buffered saline, 5 mg/kg rat).FIGURE 6Fcer1a mRNA and protein are regulated by adrenergic/cAMP stimulation. A, ISO induces Fcer1a mRNA in rat pineal glands in vivo. Rats were injected intraperitoneally with β-adrenergic agonist ISO (5 mg/kg rat) at ZT6 and were sacrificed at ZT9 (ISO + 3h, 12:12 light/dark). As controls, rats were either sacrificed at ZT6 (zero time cont) or were injected with saline at ZT6 and sacrificed at ZT9 (Cont+3h). Median sections of the rat brains were subjected to in situ hybridization as described under “Experimental Procedures” using 35S-labeled Fcer1a probe (mixed IgE-rec1 and IgE-rec2 probes).

Pinealocytes (2 × 106 cells in 250 μl Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum) dissociated from day-sacrificed rat pineal glands and grown in suspension and RBL-2H3 cells (2 × 106 cells in 250 μl Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 15% fetal calf serum) were treated with 1 μm NE and 1 mm dibutyryl cyclic AMP (DB) for 6 h separately. Untreated cells that had been incubated for 6 h were used as controls. Following treatment, cells were harvested, lyzed in 2× SDS-sample buffer in nonreducing condition, sonicated briefly (2 × 2-s pulses, Bronwill Scientific, Rochester, NY), and boiled for 5 min. Samples were run on a 10% SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with anti-FcϵRIα and anti-actin antibodies.

Briefly, pineal glands were incubated (1 h, 37 °C) with 20 units/ml papain (Worthington) and 200 units/ml DNase I (Worthington) in Earle's balanced salt solution. Subsequently, glands were triturated, and the resulting preparation was passed through a 40-μm cell strainer (BD Falcon, Bedford, MA). The pinealocytes were harvested, washed, and suspended in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (95% air, 5% CO2, 37 °C). Dispersed pinealocytes were cultured either in suspension (for Western blot analysis in Fig. 6C) or as an adherent monolayer (for immunocytochemical detection in Fig. 4) on slides precoated with polyornithine (Sigma). About 16 h following the cell preparation, the pinealocytes were treated with norepinephrine (NE, 1 μm), dibutyryl cyclic AMP (1 mm), or forskolin (10 μm) for 6 h. The rat basophilic leukemia (RBL) cell line RBL-2H3 (ATCC, Manassas, VA) (11Barsumian E.L. Isersky C. Petrino M.G. Siraganian R.P. Eur. J. Immunol. 1981; 11: 317-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar) was grown as an adherent monolayer in tissue culture flasks using Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 15% fetal calf serum in 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C. Pineal glands were cultured as described (Ref. 12Parfitt A. Weller J.L. Klein D.C. Neuropharmacology. 1976; 15: 353-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar and supplemental data). Bone marrow extraction from 2–3-month-old mice and cell preparations were done according to published procedures (Ref. 13Saitoh S. Arudchandran R. Manetz T.S. Zhang W. Sommers C.L. Love P.E.

Immunochemical Reagents—The α-subunit of FcϵRI was detected using mouse monoclonal antibody ER that was raised against the α-subunit of FcϵRI expressed in RBL-2H3 cells (11Barsumian E.L. Isersky C. Petrino M.G. Siraganian R.P. Eur. J. Immunol. 1981; 11: 317-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). S-antigen/arrestin was detected using a polyclonal rabbit anti-bovine S-antigen antiserum (NEI Z-02 from Dr. S. Zigler, NEI, National Institutes of Health). Mouse monoclonal anti-synaptophysin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and rabbit polyclonal anti-FcϵRIγ were purchased (Upstate Biotechnology). Immunocytochemistry and Fluorescence Microscopy—All immunocytochemical analyses (see Fig. 4) were done with pinealocytes attached on multichambered slides (Sigma). Dispersed pinealocytes (1 × 106 cells/chamber) were transferred to polyornithine-coated chambers on the slide. Cells were allowed to attach during overnight incubation (95% O2, 5% CO2, 37 °C). On the following day, the cells were treated with NE (1 μm) for 6 h, washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.4), fixed (2% paraformaldehyde, 20 min, 24 °C), and permeabilized (0.05% saponin, 30 min, 24 °C). The permeabilized cells were rinsed with PBS and then in PBS containing 0.1 m glycine and blocked with 2% bovine serum albumin in PBS containing 5 μg/ml donkey IgG. The cells were then rinsed twice with PBS and incubated with primary antibodies. After incubation with primary antibodies against α- and γ-subunits of the FcϵRI receptor (10 and 5 μg/ml, respectively), cells were rinsed thoroughly in PBS and incubated with goat anti-mouse F(ab′)2 conjugated to Alexa 488 (for α-subunit) or goat anti-rabbit F(ab′)2 conjugated to Alexa 594 for γ-subunit (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Finally, cells were rinsed in PBS and then in distilled water. Coverslips were mounted with Fluoromount G (EM Sciences, Fort Washington, PA). For negative controls, cells were treated identically and incubated only with secondary antibodies omitting primary antibodies. Images were acquired by scanning confocal microscopy (Leica TCS NT, Heidelberg, Germany). The confocal parameters were established at the beginning of the study and remained constant throughout with an equal brightness setting and a constant confocal aperture pinhole optimized for the objective lens used. In Situ Hybridization and Northern Blot—These methods were done using published techniques (14Kim J.S. Coon S.L. Blackshaw S. Cepko C.L. Moller M. Mukda S. Zhao W.Q. Charlton C.G. Klein D.C. J. Biol.

Real-time PCR and Quantification—RNA isolation, RNA processing, quantification, and cDNA synthesis were done as described previously (Ref. 15Møller M. Phansuwan-Pujito P. Morgan K.C. Badiu C. Cell Tissue Res. 1997; 288: 279-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar and supplemental data). Real-time quantitative PCR was performed using a LightCycler™ rapid thermal cycler system (Roche) (Refs. 16Sugden D. J.

Western Blot Analysis—To detect FcϵRIα protein, tissues or cells were homogenized in 0.1 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) using a tissue grinder. The homogenate was sonicated (three 1-s pulses, Bronwill Scientific, Rochester, NY), boiled (Laemmli sample buffer in a nonreducing condition), and clarified (centrifugation 6,000 × g, 5 min). The proteins in the supernatant were separated by SDS-PAGE (12% precast gel, Invitrogen) and were then transferred onto an Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA). FcϵRIα was detected with monoclonal ER antibody (10 μg/ml). The blots were stripped for subsequent detection with anti-actin antisera (1:1000 dilution, Sigma) to confirm equal loading (14Kim J.S.

For FcϵRIγ protein detection, samples were run under nonreducing conditions in a 4–12% NuPage BisTris gel (Invitrogen), transferred to nitrocellulose membrane, and immunodetected with rabbit anti γ-subunit antisera (1:1000 dilution, Upstate Biotechnology). Fcer1a mRNA and FcϵRIα Protein Occur in the Pineal Gland—Fcer1a mRNA and FcϵRIα protein were detected in pineal glands removed at midnight (Fig. 1, A and B) but not in those removed at noon. A similar night/day difference was obvious from in situ hybridization (Fig. 2A). Northern blot and 5′ rapid amplification of cDNA ends analysis (supplemental Fig. 1) indicated that the pineal transcript (∼1.3 kb) was identical in size and sequence to that expressed in RBL-2H3 cells (GenBank™ accession number M21622) (11Barsumian E.L.

Western blot studies indicated that the immunopositive proteins in RBL cell and in the pineal gland were similar in size (∼50kDa, Fig. 1B). The maximal level of expression of the Fcer1a mRNA occurs 5 h after the lights are turned off (midnight, ZT19, Fig. 1, C and D), and elevated expression persists during the remainder of the night period.FIGURE 2Distribution of Fcer1a mRNA. A, in situ hybridization of rat brain sections. Animals were maintained in a controlled lighting environment for 2 weeks with a 12:12 light/dark cycle. In situ hybridizations were performed using two probes, IgE rec-1 (upper panel) and IgE rec-2 (lower panel), as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Left panels are brain sections prepared from animals sacrificed at midday (ZT6), and right panels are sections from animals sacrificed at midnight (ZT12). B, Northern blot analysis of selected peripheral tissues as indicated. Tissues were collected from rats sacrificed at midday and midnight. Four μg of total RNA were loaded in each lane and were analyzed using a 32P-labeled Fcer1a probe.

The former is known to be highly rhythmic and the latter to be expressed at constant high levels (Fig. 1D). It was found that the 24-h patterns of Aanat and Fcer1a transcripts were quantitatively and qualitatively similar. Pineal Fcer1a mRNA Levels Are Relatively High Compared with Other Tissues—The level of Fcer1a mRNA in the rat pineal gland was found to be greater than other tissues examined, as indicated by the results of in situ hybridization analysis (Fig. 2A) and Northern blot analysis (Fig. 2B). The latter included bone marrow, a source of mast cells in which the transcript was undetectable. Expression in the pineal gland was less intense than in the RBL-2H3 and in a culture of mouse bone marrow-derived mast cells. Fcer1a was also expressed in mouse pineal gland as demonstrated by end-point reverse transcription-PCR (supplemental Fig. 2), indicating that expression is not unique to the rat pineal gland. The Pineal Gland Expresses FcϵRIγ but Not FcϵRIβ—The abundance of mRNA encoding the γ-chain of the FcϵRI receptor was similar in glands removed during the day or night (Fig. 1, A and D), although expression was somewhat lower than in bone marrow-derived mast cells and RBL cells (Fig. 3A). FcϵRIγ protein was also immunodetected at similar levels in the day and night pineal gland as a ∼25 kDa band using nonreducing conditions (Fig. 3B). However, pineal Fcer1b mRNA was not detected using Northern hybridization and quantitative real-time PCR methods that detect the transcript in RBL cells (data not shown). FcϵRIα and FcϵRIγ Are Expressed in the Pinealocyte—The rat pineal gland is composed primarily of pinealocytes (>90%), and it also includes parenchymal interstitial/glial cells, phagocytes, vascular pericytes, endothelial cells, and smooth muscle cells. Nonresident transiently present cells include leuckocytes and immature mast cells (19Møller M. Baeres F.M. Cell Tissue Res. 2002; 309: 139-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 20Redecker P. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1999; 191: 201-255Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To investigate whether FcϵRIα and FcϵRIγ proteins are expressed specifically in the pinealocyte, immunocytochemical analysis was done using dispersed cells. Pinealocytes were positively identified using antisera against either of two pinealocyte marker proteins, S-antigen or synatophysin (21Tamotsu S. Schomerus C. Stehle J.H. Roseboom P.H. Korf H.W. Cell Tissue Res. 1995; 282: 219-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 22Redecker P. Bargsten G. J. Neurosci. Res. 1993; 34: 79-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). FcϵRIα protein was nearly undetectable in untreated cells. However, this was increased in nearly all cells following treatment with NE (1 μm, Fig. 4A), and most of the FcϵRIα positive cells were also positive for S-antigen. FcϵRIγ protein was detected in the synaptophysin-positive cells and in other cells (Fig. 4B). As with the immunoblot analysis, FcϵRIβ protein was not detected in the pinealocytes. Moreover, there was no binding to the cells by a monoclonal antibody (mAb BC4), which detects the cell surface expression of FcϵRI (data not shown). These results demonstrate that FcϵRIα and FcϵRIγ proteins occur in the pinealocyte albeit not on the cell surface. Regulation of Fcer1a mRNA and Protein: Circadian and Photoneural Control—Circadian changes in pineal function are driven by the central circadian oscillator in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN). It is hardwired to the pineal gland and generates pineal rhythms in animals in the absence of lighting cues in constant darkness. Here we found that the daily rhythm in Fcer1a mRNA persists in animals housed in constant darkness for 3 days (DD, Fig. 5A), indicating that the day/night rhythm in Fcer1a mRNA is circadian in nature and does not require light-dark transitions. The transmission of signals from the SCN to the pineal gland is gated by light acting downstream of the SCN. To determine whether the Fcer1a mRNA levels were under photic control, animals were kept in constant light for 3 days. This blocked the nocturnal increase in Fcer1a mRNA (Fig. 5A, LL). In addition, a 30-min exposure to light at night (ZT19) rapidly reduced the abundance of Fcer1a mRNA (Fig. 1C and supplemental Fig. 3). Neural signals from the SCN to the pineal gland pass through the superior cervical ganglia (SCG), from which postganglionic processes send projections to the pineal gland (9Maronde E. Stehle J.H. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2007; 18: 142-149Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 19Møller M. Baeres F.M.

Suprachiasmatic Nucleus: The Minds Clock. 1991; (Oxford University Press, NY)Google Scholar). To determine whether neural stimulation via the SCG is required for rhythmic expression of Fcer1a in the pineal gland, the SCG was surgically decentralized. This blocked the nocturnal increase in pineal Fcer1a mRNA (Fig. 5B). Accordingly, these findings support the interpretation that the rhythm in expression of this gene is regulated by the same neural system that regulates melatonin production and many other elements of mammalian pineal function (14Kim J.S. Coon S.L. Blackshaw S. Cepko C.L. Moller M. Mukda S. Zhao W.Q. Charlton C.G. Klein D.C. J. Biol.

Adrenergic/cAMP Control of FcϵRIα mRNA and Protein—Projections from the SCG stimulate the pineal gland by releasing norepinephrine at night (23Klein D.C. CIBA Found. Symp. 1985; 117: 38-56PubMed Google Scholar). This in turn activates the adrenergic signaling cascade in the pineal gland by activating adenylate cyclase via a mechanism involving β-adrenergic receptors (26Ganguly S. Coon S.L. Klein D.C. Cell Tissue Res. 2002; 309: 127-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). To investigate whether β-adrenergic stimulation induces the Fcer1a mRNA, rats were injected with the β-adrenergic agonist ISO at ZT6 (midday). This increased Fcer1a mRNA in the pineal gland within 3 h (ZT9, Fig. 6A). It was also found that in vitro adrenergic stimulation with NE elevated Fcer1a expression (Fig. 6B). To investigate whether the adrenergic stimulation of Fcer1a expression might involve cAMP, pineal glands were treated (6 h) with either the cAMP protagonist dibutyryl cyclic AMP (1 mm) or the adenylate cyclase activator forskolin (1 μm). Both treatments increased Fcer1a mRNA (Fig. 6B). NE or dibutyryl cyclic AMP treatment of isolated pinealocytes also increased FcϵRIα protein as detected by Western blot (Fig. 6C). Together with the known stimulatory effects of NE on pinealocyte cAMP, these observations are consistent with the conclusion that that Fcer1a expression in the pinealocyte is regulated by an adrenergic/cyclic AMP mechanism. The discovery of high expression of both FcϵRIα and FcϵRIγ in the pineal gland provides tantalizing evidence that FcϵRI may have a physiological role in the pineal gland. Further support for the view that FcϵRI could function in the pineal gland comes from the finding that several molecules associated with FcϵRI signaling in the mast cell are also expressed in the pineal gland, including Lyn kinase and Fyn kinase. 4S. Ganguly and D. C. Klein, unpublished observations. In addition, serotonin, which is released by IgE-mediated mast cell activation, is robustly synthesized in the pineal gland resulting in very high concentrations (∼ 0.5 mm) (28Mefford I.N. Chang P. Klein D.C. Namboodiri M.A. Sugden D. Barchas J. Endocrinology. 1983; 113: 1582-1586Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The absence of FcϵRIβ in the pineal gland is of interest in view of the evidence that a plasma membrane-associated tetrameric receptor cannot form without this subunit (7Nadler M.J. Matthews S.A. Turner H. Kinet J.P. Adv. Immunol. 2000; 76: 325-355Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This raises the possibility that the expression of this subunit is under independent control and that the functional tetrameric receptor formation is regulated by FcϵRIβ availability. For example, it might be regulated by a cytokine that is induced by immune stress. This hypothesis was tested either by treating pinealocytes with a mixture of cytokines or by initiating experimental pinealitis and uveitis (supplemental data). However, neither treatment induced expression of the β-chain. It is also possible that a functional trimeric (αγ2) intracellular FcϵRI complex forms as appears to be the case in eosinophils, monocytes, and antigen-presenting cells (6Novak N. Bieber T. Kraft S. Curr. Allergy Asthma Rep. 2004; 4: 263-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 8Gould H.J. Sutton B.J. Beavil A.J. Beavil R.L. McCloskey N. Coker H.A. Fear D. Smurthwaite L. Annu. Rev.

These cells participate in IgE-dependent processes. Accordingly, a functional response could be generated if an IgE and allergen were translocated to the cytoplasm by the low affinity IgE receptor as occurs in the intestine (30Tu Y. Salim S. Bourgeois J. Leo DiV. Irvine E.J. Marshall J.K. Perdue M.H. Gastroenterology. 2005; 129: 928-940Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The pineal gland is not protected by the blood-brain barrier (31Møller M. van Deurs B. Westergaard E. Cell Tissue Res. 1978; 195: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) making it possible for IgE and other molecules to enter pineal perivascular space. The delivery of antigens to pinealocytes might be facilitated by resident antigen-presenting phagocytes (32Møller M. Rath M.F. Klein D.C. Chronobiol. Int. 2006; 23: 393-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Moreover, the possibility that IgE can be translocated into the pinealocyte is supported by evidence that the low affinity IgE receptor (CD23) is expressed in the pineal gland 4S. Ganguly and D. C. Klein, unpublished observations. and that PepT1, which encodes a peptide transporter, is expressed in the pineal plasma membrane at night (27Gaildrat P. Møller M. Mukda S. Humphries A. Carter D.A. Ganapathy V. Klein D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 16851-16860Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Based on these observations, it is not unreasonable to consider that allergens/IgE could enter the pinealocyte, triggering pineal responses through binding to soluble high affinity IgE receptor in the cytoplasm. A striking feature of the expression of pineal Fcer1a expression is the large night/day difference that has not been reported previously in any cell. The large changes in transcript number appear to be driven by the neural system that controls melatonin production in the pineal gland (9Maronde E. Stehle J.H. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2007; 18: 142-149Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Whereas this is a pineal gland-specific control mechanism, cyclic AMP, the second messenger mediating control of Fcer1a, is ubiquitous. This is significant because cyclic AMP might impact Fcer1a expression in other cells. The dynamic nature of the changes in Fcer1a expression not only reflects changes in cyclic AMP but is also dependent on undefined mechanisms that rapidly destroy the transcript after cyclic AMP-dependent ceases. This rhythmic pattern of transcript abundance appears to be translated immediately into a rhythm in the encoded protein. Moreover, the relatively rapid disappearance of the protein may reflect an inherent unstable nature of FcϵRIα protein in the cytosol and to rapid proteolysis, perhaps involving the proteasome as is the case with pineal arylalkylamine N-acetyltransferase (33Klein D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 4233-4237Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). The stable nature of FcϵRIα protein in the membrane in other cells appears to reflect both association with other subunits and glycosylation (34Cauvi D.M. Tian X. von Loehneyzen K. Robertson M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 10448-10460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 35Fiebiger E. Tortorella D. Jouvin M.H. Kinet J.P. Ploegh H.L. J. Exp.

Immunol. 2000; 165: 5686-5694Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar); apparently, one or both events do not occur in the pinealocyte under the conditions examined in this study. A daily rhythm in the production of FcϵRIα protein would provide the opportunity to generate new IgE·FcϵRI complexes every day, thereby providing an “up-to-date” reflection of circulating allergens and IgEs. The advantage of such a short memory immune response is not clear; however, it could mediate generation of a signal indicating that there has been a change in immune status because IgE·FcϵRI complexes on other cells are long lived. In addition to being potentially linked to the resident phagocytes, a pineal IgE·FcϵRI system might initiate T-cell-mediated inflammatory response. It is known that T-cells are recruited into the chicken, mouse, and monkey pineal gland (37Mosenson J.A. McNulty J.A. BMC Immunol. 2006; 7: 1Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 38Caroleo M.C. Frasca D. Nistico G. Doria G. Autoimmunity. 1992; 13: 303-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Although the mechanism underlying this is unknown, it might reflect penetration through the vasculature and be influenced by the release of serotonin and cytokines from pinealocytes. T-cells in the pineal extracellular space would be exposed to high concentrations of pineal products, including serotonin, melatonin, and other serotonin derivatives. The effects of most of the serotonin derivatives on lymphocytes are not known. However, melatonin has been proposed to act as an immune modulator that enhances lymphocyte proliferation and cytokine production (39Larche M. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2006; 18: 745-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 40Reiter R.J. Calvo J.R. Karbownik M. Qi W. Tan D.X. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2000; 917: 376-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar, 41Guerrero J.M. Reiter R.J. Curr. Top. Med. Chem. 2002; 2: 167-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar, 42Kuhlwein E.

Campa A. J. Neuroimmunol. 2004; 156: 146-152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The effects of exposure to high concentrations of pineal products are difficult to predict and deserve investigation. Another potential set of signaling molecules in the pineal perivascular space are dopamine and NE, the transmitters of the sympathetic nervous system that are released at night. The latter is of some special interest because IgE production in B-lymphocytes is stimulated by NE and the mechanism involves a cAMP-p38MAPK pathway (44Fedyk E.R. Adawi A. Looney R.J. Phipps R.P. Clin. Immunol. Immunopathol. 1996; 81: 101-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 45Pongratz G. McAlees J.W. Conrad D.H. Erbe R.S. Haas K.M. Sanders V.M. J. Immunol. 2006; 177: 2926-2938Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Accordingly, B-lymphocytes invading the pineal gland might be induced to secrete IgE that would then be available at high local concentrations for interactions with pinealocytes. The effects of dopamine are not known. A third set of molecules that could act on recruited lymphocytes may reside in pinealocyte dense core vesicles (20Redecker P. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1999; 191: 201-255Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These have not been fully characterized but appear to contain glutamate (20Redecker P. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1999; 191: 201-255Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The contents of these vesicles could be released via activation of the FcϵRI complex. The discovery that pinealocytes express components of the high affinity IgE receptor regulated by circadian adrenergic/cAMP mechanism is of special value because it provides investigators with a molecular foundation to obtain a better understanding of the role of the pineal gland in the immune response, which could lead to novel drug targeting strategies in allergy treatments.

https://openalex.org/W2020183479,"Rare monoclonal antibodies (Abs) can form irreversible complexes with antigens by enzyme-like covalent nucleophile-electrophile pairing. To determine the feasibility of applying irreversible antigen inactivation by Abs as the basis of vaccination against microbes, we studied the polyclonal nucleophilic Ab response induced by the electrophilic analog of a synthetic peptide corresponding to the principal neutralizing determinant (PND) of human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV) gp120 located in the V3 domain. Abs from mice immunized with the PND analog containing electrophilic phosphonates (E-PND) neutralized a homologous HIV strain (MN) ∼50-fold more potently than control Abs from mice immunized with PND. The IgG fractions displayed binding to intact HIV particles. HIV complexes formed by anti-E-PND IgG dissociated noticeably more slowly than the complexes formed by anti-PND IgG. The slower dissociation kinetics are predicted to maintain long-lasting blockade of host cell receptor recognition by gp120. Pretreatment of the anti-PND IgG with a haptenic electrophilic phosphonate compound resulted in more rapid dissociation of the HIV-IgG complexes, consistent with the hypothesis that enhanced Ab nucleophilic reactivity induced by electrophilic immunization imparts irreversible character to the complexes. These results suggest that electrophilic immunization induces a sufficiently robust nucleophilic Ab response to enhance the anti-microbial efficacy of candidate polypeptide vaccines.

Rare monoclonal Abs can form unusually stable immune complexes expressing covalent character (1Lefevre S. Kim H. Thomas D. Friboulet A. Avalle B. FEBS Lett. 2001; 489: 25-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 2Nishiyama Y. Kim S. Mitsuda Y. Taguchi H. Planque S. Salas M. Hanson C. Paul S. J. Mol. Recognit. 2006; 19: 423-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The combining site of such monoclonal Abs is usually intended to replicate enzyme active sites. Immunization with an Ab to β-lactamase, for example, is reported to induce an anti-idiotypic monoclonal Ab that forms a covalent intermediate with a β-lactam compound that is sufficiently stable to be detected in denaturing electrophoresis gels (1Lefevre S. Kim H. Thomas D. Friboulet A. Avalle B. FEBS Lett. 2001; 489: 25-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Monoclonal Abs raised to an analog of HIV gp120 containing electrophilic phosphonate diesters (E-gp120) form noncovalent immune complexes that are subsequently converted to irreversible complexes by nucleophile-electrophile interactions (2Nishiyama Y. Kim S. Mitsuda Y. Taguchi H. Planque S. Salas M. Hanson C. Paul S. J. Mol. Recognit. 2006; 19: 423-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). In this example, stimulation with the electrophilic groups is suggested to strengthen the nucleophilic reactivity of Ab combining sites by the adaptive immunological processes that are also responsible for improved noncovalent binding, i.e. V-(D)-J gene recombination, somatic hypermutation and combinatorial diversification. B cell clonal selection is thought to be driven by binding of antigen to the B cell receptor (BCR), i.e. surface Ig complexed to signal transducing proteins. As irreversible binding should permit prolonged BCR occupancy, improvement of the nucleophilic reactivity over the course of adaptive B cell differentiation is feasible. The nucleophilic reactivity is reminiscent of enzymatic active sites, in which activated groups formed by intramolecular hydrogen bonding interactions acquire an ability to conduct nucleophilic attack at electrondeficient sites in substrates. For example, the nucleophilic reactivity of the Ser-His-Asp triad in serine proteases results in the formation of enzyme-substrate covalent reaction intermediates (3Hedstrom L. Chem. Rev. 2002; 102: 4501-4524Crossref PubMed Scopus (1284) Google Scholar). Indeed, similar nucleophilic triads have been identified in monoclonal Ab combining sites by crystallography and mutagenesis studies (4Zhou G.W. Kim J. Huang W. Fletterick R.J. Scanlan T.S. Science. 1994; 265: 1059-1064Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 5Gao Q.S. Kim M. Rees A.R. Paul S. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 253: 658-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 6Ramsland P.A. Kim S.S. Cloud G. Bourne C.R. Farrugia W. Tribbick G. Geysen H.M. Moomaw C.R. Slaughter C.A. Edmundson A.B. Biochem. J. 2006; 395: 473-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Completion of the catalytic cycle following the nucleophile-electrophile reaction requires various additional accessory groups in the active site. Consequently, some but not all nucleophilic Abs proceed to catalyze chemical reactions (7Paul S. Kim S. Zhou Y.X. Taguchi H. Bhatia G. Karle S. Hanson C. Nishiyama Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 20429-20435Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The ability to form long-lasting immune complexes can be anticipated to enhance the antigen inactivation potency of irreversibly binding Abs compared with their reversibly binding counterparts. This leads to the hypothesis that electrophilic antigen analogs can serve as the basis for vaccine formulations capable of inducing improved protective Ab responses to microbial antigens compared with conventional vaccines. The hypothetical improvement in vaccine formulation will depend on the proportion of the induced polyclonal Ab response that displays covalent character while maintaining the correct epitope specificity necessary for recognition of the native antigen structure. In previous studies using full-length E-gp120 as the immunogen, several monoclonal Abs were identified that formed unusually stable immune complexes with gp120 devoid of exogenously introduced electrophilic groups (2Nishiyama Y. Kim S. Mitsuda Y. Taguchi H. Planque S. Salas M. Hanson C. Paul S. J. Mol. Recognit. 2006; 19: 423-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). However, full-length E-gp120 expresses a multitude of epitopes, and we were unable to relate Ab covalency and HIV neutralization because of the varying Ab epitope specificities. Moreover, a rigorous covalent ELISA protocol was employed to screen hybridoma supernatants. Consequently, there is no assurance that anything more than a small minority of the overall Ab response to E-gp120 expresses the desired covalent character of the monoclonal Abs. The immune response following HIV infection is dominated by Abs to the principal neutralization determinant (PND) of gp120 corresponding to residues 306–328 located in the V3 domain (8Broliden P.A.

We observed that immunization with E-PND induced Abs that neutralized HIV more potently and dissociated from intact HIV virions more slowly than control Abs from PND-immunized mice. These results indicate the improved antigen inactivation potency due to Ab nucleophilicity and suggest the utility of electrophilic immunization as a novel vaccination strategy. PND Analogs—PND peptide 1a corresponding to gp120 residues 306–328 of HIV strain MN (YNKRKRIHIGPGRAFYTTKNIIG) and its biotinylated analog (Bt-PND 1b) were prepared by Fmoc-based solid phase synthesis followed by purification with reversed phase HPLC (1a: observed m/z 2705.3; calcd m/z 2705.2. 1b: observed m/z 3043.0; calcd m/z 3044.6; Genemed Synthesis, South San Francisco, CA). The electrophilic phosphonate analog of PND (E-PND 2a) was prepared by acylation of 1a with N-hydroxysuccinimidyl ester of diphenyl (suberoyl) amino(4-amidinophenyl) methanephosphonate as follows. PND 1a (10 mg, 3.7 μmol) was allowed to react with the acylating agent (33 mg, 44 μmol) in dimethyl sulfoxide (6.6 ml) and 100 mm phosphate-buffered saline, pH 8 (4.0 ml) for 1 h. Excess acylating agent was quenched by addition of 1 m glycine (2 ml). 15 min thereafter, the precipitate was collected by centrifugation, washed with cold water (4 ml × 3), and subjected to HPLC purification (YMC-Pack ODS-AM, 4.6 × 250 mm; gradient of 10% to 80% acetonitrile in 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid/water, 45 min). This yielded chromatographically pure E-PND 2a (5.4 mg, 31%), which was characterized by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (observed m/z, 1594.5, 1196.5, 957.7; calcd m/z for C235H319N51O50P4, 1595.1 (3+), 1196.6 (4+), 957.5 (5+)). Biotinylated E-PND (Bt-E-PND 2b) was prepared from Bt-PND 1b in the same manner (observed m/z, 1151.1, 921.3, 767.9; calcd m/z for C223H314N51O48P3S, 1151.6 (4+), 921.5 (5+), 768.0 (6+). Antibodies—Female MRL/lpr mice (n = 5/immunogen; Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME; 8 weeks age) were immunized intraperitoneally on days 0, 15, 29, 44, 58, and 101 with PND 1a or E-PND 2a (50 μg for the first 4 injections and 200 μg for the last 2 injections) in RIBI adjuvant (monophosphoryl lipid A-trehalose dicorynomycolate emulsion; Sigma-Aldrich). Blood was obtained from the retroorbital plexus over the course of the immunization schedule (days 0, 15, 29, 44, 58, 65, and 111). Development of PND-reactive IgG was examined by ELISA using Bt-PND 1b (4 μg/ml) immobilized on streptavidin-coated plates, sera diluted 1:5000 in 10 mm PBS containing 0.025% Tween 20 and 1% bovine serum albumin, and peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Fc specific; Sigma-Aldrich) as secondary Ab. IgG was purified to electrophoretic homogeneity from serum (prepared from blood collected 10 days after the last immunization) by affinity chromatography on protein-G Sepharose (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ) (15Kalaga R. Kim L. O'Dell J.R. Paul S. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 2695-2702PubMed Google Scholar). HIV Neutralization—Neutralization of HIV (strain MN, clade B) by serially diluted sera or purified IgG samples was determined in a “microplaque” reduction assay using cells of the MT-2 T lymphocyte cell line as hosts (16Hanson C.V. Kim L. Sheppard H.W. J. Clin. Microbiol. 1990; 28: 2030-2034Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Neutralization of strain ZA009 (clade C) was measured by the p24 capsid protein assay with human peripheral blood mononuclear cells as hosts (17Karle S. Kim S. Nishiyama Y. Taguchi H. Zhou Y.X. Salas M. Lake D. Thiagarajan P. Arnett F. Hanson C.V. Paul S. AIDS. 2004; 18: 329-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Concentrations yielding 50 and 80% inhibition (IC50 and IC80) were obtained from the least-square-fits to a sigmoidal dose-response shown in Equation 1. Neutralization=TOP/(1+10((logIC50-X)×HillSlope))(Eq. 1) HIV Binding Assays—Purified IgG (17 μg/ml) and HIV (MN strain, 1.6 × 104 TCID50/ml; TCID50, 50% tissue culture infective dose) were incubated in a mixture of 10 mm phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, and RPMI1640 (1:1) containing 10% fetal bovine serum at 4 °C for 16 h. HIV-IgG complexes (and free IgG) were captured on Protein G-Sepharose (100 μlof settled gel) using Bio-Spin chromatography columns (Bio-Rad), and unbound HIV removed by washing with the reaction buffer (500 μl × 8). The captured complexes were eluted with 100 mm glycine·HCl, pH 2.7 (400 μl), HIV was lysed with Triton X-100 (10%) and p24 in the lysates was measured with Coulter HIV-1 p24 Antigen Assay kit. Values were corrected for nonspecific HIV binding to the affinity gel, determined by identical processing of control HIV treated with diluent in the absence of IgG (A490, 0.21 ± 0.01). In competition experiments, IgG and HIV were incubated in the presence of excess PND peptide 1a (50 μg/ml) or an irrelevant peptide (gp120 residues 465–479 of MN strain; NIH AIDS Research and Reference Reagent program), and HIV-IgG complexes were measured as above. To determine dissociation kinetics, HIV-IgG complexes were allowed to form for 16 h (IgG 50 μg/ml, HIV 1.6 × 104 TCID50/ml), excess PND 1a (50 μg/ml) was added to the reaction mixtures to preclude reassociation of any complexes undergoing dissociation. Aliquots of the reaction mixtures withdrawn 0.5, 2, 4, 8, and 14 h thereafter were immediately subjected to protein G chromatography and p24 assays to determine residual immune complexes as described above. IgG Nucleophilic Reactivity—Bt-E-PND 2b (1 μm) was incubated with IgG (75 μg/ml) for 2 h, the reaction mixtures were boiled, subjected to reducing SDS-electrophoresis, and the covalent adducts were detected by streptavidin-peroxidase staining of the blots as described previously (18Planque S.

To study the role of IgG nucleophilic reactivity in HIV binding, the IgG (1.4 mg/ml) was treated with the haptenic phosphonate 3 (1 mm; diphenyl benzyloxycarbonylamino(4-amidinophenyl) methanephosphonate, synthesis described in ref 19Nishiyama Y. Kim H. Luo J.Q. Zhou Y.X. Burr G. Karle S. Paul S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2002; 402: 281-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) at room temperature for 13 h. After removing unreacted phosphonate by gel filtration (Bio-spin 6, Bio-Rad; IgG recovery 88%), the dissociation kinetics of the HIV-IgG complexes was studied as above. Immunogenicity—The E-PND immunogen 2a corresponds to the amino acid sequence of HIV gp120 residues 306–328 (MN strain) with 4 electrophilic phosphonate diester groups located at the side chains of Lys308, Lys310, and Lys324 residues and the N terminus (Fig. 1A). The phosphonate groups are structurally identical to those incorporated into full-length gp120 and other polypeptides in previous studies (7Paul S. Kim S. Zhou Y.X. Taguchi H. Bhatia G. Karle S.

We employed multiple phosphonate groups within a single E-PND molecule to increase the probability of nucleophile-electrophile pairing coordinated with noncovalent binding at the proximate peptide regions. The control immunogen PND 1a was the identical peptide structure devoid of the phosphonate groups. Successive immunizations of mice with E-PND 2a or PND 1a resulted in progressively increasing PND binding activity in serum IgG obtained over days 15 to 65 (mean A490 ± S.D. for 1:5000-diluted pooled sera using immobilized Bt-PND 1b increased from 0.06 ± 0.10 to 0.71 ± 0.13 in 2a-immunized mice and from 0.01 ± 0.01 to 0.42 ± 0.28 in 1a-immunized mice; n = 5 mice each; preimmune mouse serum binding, 0.01 ± 0.01). ELISA assays using the final bleeds obtained on day 111 indicated that each of the mice had mounted an IgG response to PND (A490 values for sera from individual 2a-immunized mice at 1:1000 dilution, 0.79 ± 0.01, 0.47 ± 0.03, 1.48 ± 0.01, 0.72 ± 0.02, 2.59 ± 0.09). These results indicate that Abs to E-PND can recognize PND devoid of the electrophilic groups. HIV Neutralization—Pooled sera from the mice (day 111) were assayed for the ability to neutralize HIV strain MN (clade B, coreceptor CXCR4-dependent) using MT-2 host cells. Serially diluted sera were incubated with the virus and the infectivity was measured by the microplaque assay (16Hanson C.V. Kim L. Sheppard H.W. J. Clin. Microbiol. 1990; 28: 2030-2034Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Dose-dependent HIV neutralization was observed, with the sera from E-PND 2a-immunized mice displaying 44–272-fold greater neutralizing potency compared with sera from PND 1a–immunized mice (dilution yielding 50% neutralization, 1:787 versus 1:34,444; dilution yielding 80% neutralization, 1:54 versus 1:14,692; Fig. 1B). The consistency of the Ab response was confirmed by assaying neutralization by sera from individual E-PND 2a-immunized mice and PND 1a-immunized mice (Fig. 1C; n = 5 and 4 mice, respectively). Mean % neutralization ± S.D. values at 1:800 dilution of sera from the E-PND and PND groups were, respectively, 92 ± 18 and 25 ± 2%; p = 0.0002, unpaired t test, two-tailed. The superior neutralizing Ab response in E-PND 2a immunization was confirmed using pooled IgG purified by affinity chromatography on protein G-Sepharose columns (Table 1). IgG from E-PND 2a-immunized mice was 59-fold more potent than IgG from PND 1a-immunized mice (IC50 values, respectively, 2 versus 118 μg/ml). Serum from E-PND or PND immunized mice at dilutions as low as 1:500 failed to neutralize the clade C strain ZA009 (core-ceptor R5-dependent; data not shown). This is consistent with the highly divergent sequences of the strain MN PND peptide employed as immunogen and the PND expressed by strain ZA009 (respectively, YNKRKRIHIGPGRAFYTTKNIIG and NNTRKSMRIGPGQVFYATNGIIG).TABLE 1HIV neutralizing activity of anti-E-PND and anti-PND IgGsIgGIC50IC80μg/mlμg/mlPreimmune>463>463Anti-PND118362Anti-E-PND25 Open table in a new tab HIV Binding Characteristics—To study Ab binding to the native PND structure expressed on the viral surface, we used intact, infectious HIV particles. The virion preparation (MN strain) was incubated with purified IgG, the HIV-IgG complexes were captured using immobilized protein G, the complexes were eluted at acid pH and virions were lysed with a detergent, and p24 was measured by ELISA. As shed gp120 is not associated with p24, the method detects Ab-HIV complexes without interference from free gp120 shed by the virus. Binding of the virions by IgG preparations from E-PND 2a-immunized and PND 1a-immunized mice was evident at levels greater than control IgG from preimmune mice (Fig. 2A). Near-complete competitive inhibition of the binding was observed in the presence of excess PND 1a but not an irrelevant HIV peptide (Fig. 2B), indicating that virion binding by IgG induced by E-PND 2a immunization is attributable to specific recognition of the PND region. To study immune complex stability, we measured the dissociation rates of the HIV-IgG complexes. After the complexes had been formed, excess PND 1a (18.5 μm) was added to the reaction mixtures to preclude reassociation of HIV that had undergone dissociation, and the residual complexes were measured periodically by the p24 assay. Dissociation of HIV complexed to IgG induced by immunization with PND 1a occurred rapidly and proceeded at a rate consistent with the first-order dissociation equation (half-life, t½1, 10.6 min; r2 0.985; Fig. 3). Dissociation of anti-E-PND IgG complexes was substantially slower and suggested two subpopulations of complexes, a subpopulation that dissociated slowly over 8 h (∼70% of initial complexes; nominal t½1 assuming first order kinetics and complete dissociation over 8 h, 2.5 h, r2 0.971) and another subpopulation that did not dissociate detectably between 8 and 14 h (∼30% of initial complexes). Ab Nucleophilic Reactivity—The strongly electrophilic phosphonate in probe E-PND 2b (Fig. 1A) is known to form stable covalent bonds with Ab nucleophiles (7Paul S. Kim S. Zhou Y.X. Taguchi H.

Immunol. 2007; 44: 2707-2718Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In addition, this probe contains the PND peptide regions available for noncovalent Ab binding. As a test of antigen-specific nucleophilic reactivity, we measured the formation of covalent adducts of IgG and Bt-E-PND 2b. Boiled reaction mixtures of the IgG and E-PND 2b were analyzed by reducing SDS-electrophoresis and densitometry. Adducts of 2b formed by the IgG heavy and light chains from E-PND-immunized mice accumulated more rapidly than the adducts from control PND-immunized mice or control non-immune IgG (Fig. 4A, 60 kDa heavy chain adduct intensities in arbitrary volume units from 2a-immunized mice, 1a-immunized mice and preimmune mice, respectively, 3881, 830, and 111; 30-kDa light chain adduct intensities, respectively, 1869, <12, and <12). In previous studies, we employed the small molecule phosphonate 3 (Fig. 4B) as a probe for nucleophilic reactivity of Abs independent of noncovalent binding forces responsible for specific recognition of polypeptide antigens (18Planque S.

Rees A.R. Paul S. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 253: 658-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 24Sun M. Kim Q.S. Kirnarskiy L. Rees A. Paul S. J. Mol.

Biotechnol. 1996; 5: 197-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), distinct sites in antigen-specific Abs are responsible for the nucleophilic and noncovalent binding activities. Following treatment with excess phosphonate 3 and removal of the unreacted phosphonate 3, IgG from E-PND immunized mice retained the ability to bind HIV. However, the dissociation of HIV complexes formed by phosphonate 3-treated anti-E-PND IgG was accelerated compared with the control IgG treated with diluent, and unlike the control HIV-IgG complexes, the dissociation of HIV complexes formed by phosphonate 3-treated IgG proceeded to near-completion within 1 h (Fig. 4B). These results suggest that nucleophilic sites in IgG from the E-PND-immunized mice are responsible for the enhanced stability of the immune complexes and superior HIV neutralization. An effective vaccine against diverse HIV strains found in different geographical regions and escape mutants that emerge in the course of infection remains elusive. The anti-viral efficacy of various Abs directed to the neutralizing epitopes of the HIV envelope depends largely on their first order dissociation rate constants (koff; t½1 = ln 2/koff) and concentrations in biological fluids. The Ab-virus association rate constant (kon) also contributes to the observed binding affinity (Ka = kon/koff), but different Abs to a given viral epitope usually display comparable kon values, as this constant is controlled mainly by the rate of diffusion and the orientation of collisions between the reactants. A previous study has highlighted the correlation between the HIV neutralizing potency and dissociation rate constants of monoclonal Abs to the PND, the epitope targeted in the present study (26VanCott T.C. Kim F.R. Polonis V.R. Gorny M.K. Zolla-Pazner S. Redfield R.R. Birx D.L. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 449-459PubMed Google Scholar). We reported that rare monoclonal Abs raised to an electrophilic analog of full-length gp120 neutralized HIV and formed unusually stable immune complexes with gp120 devoid of exogenous electrophiles (2Nishiyama Y. Kim S. Mitsuda Y. Taguchi H. Planque S. Salas M. Hanson C. Paul S. J. Mol. Recognit. 2006; 19: 423-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The stability of the immune complexes was attributable to the adaptively strengthened nucleophilic groups in the Abs induced by electrophilic immunization. The nucleophilic groups are hypothesized to lend covalent character to the complexes by pairing with natural electrophilic groups in gp120. Regrettably, polyclonal IgG from the mice immunized with full-length E-gp120 failed to neutralize HIV at levels superior to IgG from non-immunized mice, presumably because the overall polyclonal immune response is dominated by Abs to irrelevant epitopes and Abs with sufficient nucleophilic reactivity to the neutralizing epitope were present only at low concentrations. In the present study, a well characterized synthetic analog of the peptide corresponding to the principal neutralizing determinant of HIV str"
https://openalex.org/W2056175968,"DNA adenine methylation plays an important role in several critical bacterial processes including mismatch repair, the timing of DNA replication and the transcriptional control of gene expression. The dependence of bacterial virulence on DNA adenine methyltransferase (Dam) has led to the proposal that selective Dam inhibitors might function as broad spectrum antibiotics.Herein we report the expression and purification of Yersinia pestis Dam and the development of a continuous fluorescence based assay for DNA adenine methyltransferase activity that is suitable for determining the kinetic parameters of the enzyme and for high throughput screening against potential Dam inhibitors. The assay utilised a hemimethylated break light oligonucleotide substrate containing a GATC methylation site. When this substrate was fully methylated by Dam, it became a substrate for the restriction enzyme DpnI, resulting in separation of fluorophore (fluorescein) and quencher (dabcyl) and therefore an increase in fluorescence. The assays were monitored in real time using a fluorescence microplate reader in 96 well format and were used for the kinetic characterisation of Yersinia pestis Dam, its substrates and the known Dam inhibitor, S-adenosylhomocysteine. The assay has been validated for high throughput screening, giving a Z-factor of 0.71+/-0.07 indicating that it is a sensitive assay for the identification of inhibitors.The assay is therefore suitable for high throughput screening for inhibitors of DNA adenine methyltransferases and the kinetic characterisation of the inhibition."
