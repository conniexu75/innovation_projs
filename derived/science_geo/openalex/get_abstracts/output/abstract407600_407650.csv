https://openalex.org/W1976033223,"Recurrent chromosomal translocations involving the mixed lineage leukaemia (MLL) gene initiate aggressive forms of leukaemia, which are often refractory to conventional therapies. Many MLL-fusion partners are members of the super elongation complex (SEC), a critical regulator of transcriptional elongation, suggesting that aberrant control of this process has an important role in leukaemia induction. Here we use a global proteomic strategy to demonstrate that MLL fusions, as part of SEC and the polymerase-associated factor complex (PAFc), are associated with the BET family of acetyl-lysine recognizing, chromatin 'adaptor' proteins. These data provided the basis for therapeutic intervention in MLL-fusion leukaemia, via the displacement of the BET family of proteins from chromatin. We show that a novel small molecule inhibitor of the BET family, GSK1210151A (I-BET151), has profound efficacy against human and murine MLL-fusion leukaemic cell lines, through the induction of early cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. I-BET151 treatment in two human leukaemia cell lines with different MLL fusions alters the expression of a common set of genes whose function may account for these phenotypic changes. The mode of action of I-BET151 is, at least in part, due to the inhibition of transcription at key genes (BCL2, C-MYC and CDK6) through the displacement of BRD3/4, PAFc and SEC components from chromatin. In vivo studies indicate that I-BET151 has significant therapeutic value, providing survival benefit in two distinct mouse models of murine MLL-AF9 and human MLL-AF4 leukaemia. Finally, the efficacy of I-BET151 against human leukaemia stem cells is demonstrated, providing further evidence of its potent therapeutic potential. These findings establish the displacement of BET proteins from chromatin as a promising epigenetic therapy for these aggressive leukaemias."
https://openalex.org/W2092992881,"Alternative splicing of pre-messenger RNA is a key feature of transcriptome expansion in eukaryotic cells, yet its regulation is poorly understood. Spliceosome assembly occurs co-transcriptionally, raising the possibility that DNA structure may directly influence alternative splicing. Supporting such an association, recent reports have identified distinct histone methylation patterns, elevated nucleosome occupancy and enriched DNA methylation at exons relative to introns. Moreover, the rate of transcription elongation has been linked to alternative splicing. Here we provide the first evidence that a DNA-binding protein, CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF), can promote inclusion of weak upstream exons by mediating local RNA polymerase II pausing both in a mammalian model system for alternative splicing, CD45, and genome-wide. We further show that CTCF binding to CD45 exon 5 is inhibited by DNA methylation, leading to reciprocal effects on exon 5 inclusion. These findings provide a mechanistic basis for developmental regulation of splicing outcome through heritable epigenetic marks."

Mouse models based on human disease-causing mutations provide the potential for understanding gene function and novel treatment development. Here, we characterize a mouse knockout of the Cntnap2 gene, which is strongly associated with ASD and allied neurodevelopmental disorders. Cntnap2(-/-) mice show deficits in the three core ASD behavioral domains, as well as hyperactivity and epileptic seizures, as have been reported in humans with CNTNAP2 mutations. Neuropathological and physiological analyses of these mice before the onset of seizures reveal neuronal migration abnormalities, reduced number of interneurons, and abnormal neuronal network activity. In addition, treatment with the FDA-approved drug risperidone ameliorates the targeted repetitive behaviors in the mutant mice. These data demonstrate a functional role for CNTNAP2 in brain development and provide a new tool for mechanistic and therapeutic research in ASD."
https://openalex.org/W2135518377,"The let-7 tumor suppressor microRNAs are known for their regulation of oncogenes, while the RNA-binding proteins Lin28a/b promote malignancy by inhibiting let-7 biogenesis. We have uncovered unexpected roles for the Lin28/let-7 pathway in regulating metabolism. When overexpressed in mice, both Lin28a and LIN28B promote an insulin-sensitized state that resists high-fat-diet induced diabetes. Conversely, muscle-specific loss of Lin28a or overexpression of let-7 results in insulin resistance and impaired glucose tolerance. These phenomena occur, in part, through the let-7-mediated repression of multiple components of the insulin-PI3K-mTOR pathway, including IGF1R, INSR, and IRS2. In addition, the mTOR inhibitor, rapamycin, abrogates Lin28a-mediated insulin sensitivity and enhanced glucose uptake. Moreover, let-7 targets are enriched for genes containing SNPs associated with type 2 diabetes and control of fasting glucose in human genome-wide association studies. These data establish the Lin28/let-7 pathway as a central regulator of mammalian glucose metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W2012253237,"The subventricular zone of many adult non-human mammals generates large numbers of new neurons destined for the olfactory bulb. Along the walls of the lateral ventricles, immature neuronal progeny migrate in tangentially oriented chains that coalesce into a rostral migratory stream (RMS) connecting the subventricular zone to the olfactory bulb. The adult human subventricular zone, in contrast, contains a hypocellular gap layer separating the ependymal lining from a periventricular ribbon of astrocytes. Some of these subventricular zone astrocytes can function as neural stem cells in vitro, but their function in vivo remains controversial. An initial report found few subventricular zone proliferating cells and rare migrating immature neurons in the RMS of adult humans. In contrast, a subsequent study indicated robust proliferation and migration in the human subventricular zone and RMS. Here we find that the infant human subventricular zone and RMS contain an extensive corridor of migrating immature neurons before 18 months of age but, contrary to previous reports, this germinal activity subsides in older children and is nearly extinct by adulthood. Surprisingly, during this limited window of neurogenesis, not all new neurons in the human subventricular zone are destined for the olfactory bulb--we describe a major migratory pathway that targets the prefrontal cortex in humans. Together, these findings reveal robust streams of tangentially migrating immature neurons in human early postnatal subventricular zone and cortex. These pathways represent potential targets of neurological injuries affecting neonates."

https://openalex.org/W2098264151,"Autophagy is an important intracellular catabolic mechanism that mediates the degradation of cytoplasmic proteins and organelles. We report a potent small molecule inhibitor of autophagy named “spautin-1” for specific and potent autophagy inhibitor-1. Spautin-1 promotes the degradation of Vps34 PI3 kinase complexes by inhibiting two ubiquitin-specific peptidases, USP10 and USP13, that target the Beclin1 subunit of Vps34 complexes. Beclin1 is a tumor suppressor and frequently monoallelically lost in human cancers. Interestingly, Beclin1 also controls the protein stabilities of USP10 and USP13 by regulating their deubiquitinating activities. Since USP10 mediates the deubiquitination of p53, regulating deubiquitination activity of USP10 and USP13 by Beclin1 provides a mechanism for Beclin1 to control the levels of p53. Our study provides a molecular mechanism involving protein deubiquitination that connects two important tumor suppressors, p53 and Beclin1, and a potent small molecule inhibitor of autophagy as a possible lead compound for developing anticancer drugs.

Takegawa K. Fry M.J. Stack J.H. Waterfield M.D. Emr S.D. Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase encoded by yeast VPS34 gene essential for protein sorting.Science. 1993; 260: 88-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (786) Google Scholar). In contrast to class I PI3 kinase, which has been extensively studied, much less is known about the class III PI3 kinase or its regulation in mammalian cells. Emerging evidence indicates a central role of Vps34 PI3K activity and its protein partners in orchestrating both initiation and maturation of autophagosomes (Simonsen and Tooze, 2009Simonsen A. Tooze S.A. Coordination of membrane events during autophagy by multiple class III PI3-kinase complexes.J. Cell Biol. 2009; 186: 773-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). Thus, exploring the mechanisms that regulate the class III PI3 kinase has direct implications in our understanding of these important intracellular mechanisms as well as for developing therapies for treatment of human diseases. Similar to their homologs in yeast, Vps34 in mammalian cells is present in two complexes: Vps34 complex I and Vps34 complex II (Itakura et al., 2008Itakura E. Kishi C. Inoue K. Mizushima N.

Cell Biol. 2009; 11: 468-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar). These two complexes share the core components of Vps34, Beclin1 and p150; and in addition, complex I contains Atg14L and complex II contains UVRAG. Interestingly, the stabilities of different components of Vps34 complexes are codependent upon each other as knockdown of one component often reduces the levels of others in the complexes (Itakura et al., 2008Itakura E. Kishi C. Inoue K. Mizushima N. Beclin 1 forms two distinct phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase complexes with mammalian Atg14 and UVRAG.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2008; 19: 5360-5372Crossref PubMed Scopus (795) Google Scholar). Beclin1 has been characterized as a tumor suppressor, and its importance is underscored by both the frequent monoallelic loss of beclin1 in human breast, ovarian and prostate tumors, and an increased rate of malignant tumors in BECN1+/− mice (Liang et al., 1999Liang X.H. Jackson S. Seaman M. Brown K. Kempkes B. Hibshoosh H. Levine B. Induction of autophagy and inhibition of tumorigenesis by beclin 1.Nature. 1999; 402: 672-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (2535) Google Scholar, Qu et al., 2003Qu X. Yu J. Bhagat G. Furuya N. Hibshoosh H.

Beclin 1, an autophagy gene essential for early embryonic development, is a haploinsufficient tumor suppressor.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2003; 100: 15077-15082Crossref PubMed Scopus (1620) Google Scholar). Although autophagy deficiency has been proposed to be the mechanism for the increased tumorigenesis in BECN1+/− mice, a recent study using tissue-specific knockout mice of Atg5 and Atg7 suggests that autophagy deficiency may lead to benign tumors in livers, but not in other tissues (Takamura et al., 2011Takamura A. Komatsu M. Hara T. Sakamoto A. Kishi C. Waguri S. Eishi Y. Hino O. Tanaka K. Mizushima N. Autophagy-deficient mice develop multiple liver tumors.Genes Dev. 2011; 25: 795-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (808) Google Scholar). Thus, the mechanism of Beclin1 as a tumor suppressor remains as a puzzle. Small molecule inhibitors are important tools in exploring the cellular mechanisms in mammalian cells. However, the only available small molecule inhibitor of autophagy is 3-methyladenine (3-MA), which has a working concentration of ∼10 mM and inhibits multiple forms of PI3 kinases. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop highly specific small molecule tools that can be used to facilitate the studies of autophagy in mammalian cells. Using an imaging-based screen, we identified a small molecule inhibitor of autophagy and developed it into a highly potent autophagy inhibitor. We named it “spautin-1” for specific and potent autophagy inhibitor-1. We explored the mechanism by which spautin-1 inhibits autophagy and found that it inhibits two ubiquitin specific peptidases, USP10 and USP13, which regulate the deubiquitination of Beclin1 in Vps34 complexes. Using spautin-1 as a tool, we explored the interaction of USP10 and USP13 with Vps34 complexes. Interestingly, we found that Vps34 complexes interact with USP13 and the stabilities of USP10 and USP13 are coordinately regulated with that of Vps34 complexes. Since USP10 is a deubiquitinating enzyme for p53 and regulates the levels of p53 by controlling p53 ubiquitination and degradation (Yuan et al., 2010Yuan J. Luo K. Zhang L. Cheville J.C. Lou Z. USP10 regulates p53 localization and stability by deubiquitinating p53.Cell. 2010; 140: 384-396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar), regulating the stability of USP10 and USP13 by Vps34 complexes provides a molecular mechanism for class III PI3 kinase to control the levels of p53. Indeed, as predicted by our model, we found that the levels of p53 are reduced in the tissues of BECN1+/− mice, which provide a molecular mechanism for the increased tumorigenesis after monoallelic loss of beclin1. Our results demonstrate that class III PI3 kinase is an important tumor suppressor that can regulate the levels of p53 through controlling its deubiquitination. In an imaging-based screen using LC3-GFP as a marker for autophagy (Zhang et al., 2007Zhang L. Yu J. Pan H. Hu P. Hao Y. Cai W. Zhu H. Yu A.D. Xie X. Ma D. et al.Small molecule regulators of autophagy identified by an image-based high-throughput screen.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2007; 104: 19023-19028Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar), we identified a small molecule inhibitor of autophagy, MBCQ, from the ICCB known bioactive library (Figure 1A ). MBCQ was previously known as an inhibitor of phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5), an enzyme that degrades cGMP by hydrolysis (MacPherson et al., 2006MacPherson J.D. Gillespie T.D. Dunkerley H.A. Maurice D.H. Bennett B.M. Inhibition of phosphodiesterase 5 selectively reverses nitrate tolerance in the venous circulation.J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2006; 317: 188-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Stimulation of H4-LC3-GFP cells with rapamycin led to increases in the levels of LC3-GFP as expected. A quantitative analysis of LC3-GFP puncta using high throughput microscopy showed that the treatment of MBCQ reduced the spot numbers as well as spot size and spot intensity of LC3-GFP dots compared to that of control or rapamycin treatment alone (Figure 1B). Thus, the presence of MBCQ inhibited both basal as well as rapamycin induced LC3-GFP autophagic puncta. This result was further confirmed by LC3 western blot analysis (Figure 1C), and similar results were obtained using mouse embryonic fibroblast cells (MEFs) (Figure S1A). Inhibition of autophagy by MBCQ was rapid (Figure 1B) and dose-dependent with an IC50 of 0.8 μM (Figure S1B), which is significantly more potent than the commonly used class III PI3 kinase inhibitor, 3-methyladenine (3-MA). We have also confirmed the autophagy inhibitory activity of MBCQ by electron microscopic studies. Cells treated with rapamycin showed a large number of autophagosomes with characteristic double membrane, which were conspicuously absent in cells treated with rapamycin and MBCQ (Figure S1C ). Finally, the treatment of MBCQ was able to reduce the autophagic puncta of LC3-GFP in the presence of rapamycin, under starvation conditions or with bafilomycin which blocks lysosomal degradation (Figure S1D). Thus, MBCQ is an upstream inhibitor of autophagy. One hundred and twelve derivatives of MBCQ were synthesized and analyzed to determine if its activity in inhibiting autophagy could be separated from its inhibition of PDE5 (Table S1 and data not shown). The chemical synthetic schemes are shown in the Extended Experimental Procedures. We selected 9 MBCQ derivatives based on their efficacy in inhibiting autophagy and screened for their activities on PDE5 (Wang et al., 2008Wang H. Yan Z. Yang S. Cai J. Robinson H. Ke H. Kinetic and structural studies of phosphodiesterase-8A and implication on the inhibitor selectivity.Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 12760-12768Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). We found that C43 (6-fluoro-N-[4-fluorobenzyl]quinazolin-4-amine), an effective autophagy inhibitor with an IC50 of 0.74 μM (Figure 1D-F), which is comparable to that of MBCQ, has significantly reduced activity toward PDE5 and other PDEs (Figures S2A and S2B and Table S1). Thus, the PDE5 inhibiting activity of MBCQ can be chemically separated from its autophagy inhibiting activity. Consistent with a separation of PDE5 and autophagy inhibiting activities in MBCQ, there were a number of other known PDE5 inhibitors in the bioactive library that we screened, including MY-5445, dipyridamole, IBMX and sildenafil (Viagra), which were not identified as autophagy inhibitors. To further confirm this conclusion, we treated H4-LC3-GFP cells with rapamycin and other PDE5 inhibitors including MY-5445, dipyridamole, IBMX or sildenafil using MBCQ as a positive control. None of the specific PDE5 inhibitors tested, including the most potent PDE5 inhibitor, sildenafil (Viagra) which has an IC50 of 2.5 nM for PDE5, had any activity on autophagy (data not shown). Thus, we conclude that the autophagy inhibiting activity of MBCQ is not related to its PDE5 inhibiting activity. To further examine the specificity of C43 in inhibiting autophagy, we treated mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEF) cells with C43 or C71, a negative control, in the presence of rapamycin with the levels of autophagy determined by LC3 western blotting. Treatment with C43, but not a negative control C71, inhibited autophagy induced by rapamycin (Figures 1D–1F) and starvation (Figure S2C). We also confirmed the inhibition of autophagy by C43 using electron microscopy (Figure S2D). Furthermore, the treatment of C43 inhibited autophagy activated in the presence of E64D, a protease inhibitor that increases the accumulation of autophagosome by blocking lysosomal degradation (Figure 1G). Based on these data, we conclude that C43 is a potent inhibitor of autophagy and named it “spautin-1” for specific and potent autophagy inhibitor-1. We first characterized the biological effects of spautin-1 at the cellular level in a selected subset of cancer cell lines. Spautin-1 had no effect on the growth and survival of Bcap-37 cells under normal culture conditions (Figure 2A ) but dramatically enhanced cell death in glucose-free media (Figure 2B). Bcap-37 cells treated with spautin-1 under glucose-free condition showed apoptotic morphology (Figure 2C) and characteristic PARP cleavage (Figure 2D). Western blotting for LC3 further confirmed that autophagy was induced under glucose-free conditions, which was inhibited by spautin-1 (Figure 2E). Similar results were obtained with MCF-7 and BT549 cells (data not shown). Thus, spautin-1 can sensitize tumor cells to apoptosis under nutritional deprived conditions. In contrast to the above cancer cell lines analyzed, MDCK cells, a normal cell line derived from the Madin-Darby canine kidney, treatment with spautin-1 under glucose-free conditions did not undergo apoptosis (Figures S3A and S3B ). Hs578Bst cells, a myoepithelial cell line established from normal tissue peripheral to a breast cancer, were also not sensitive to the treatment of spautin-1 (Figures S3C and S3D). These results are consistent with the proposal that cancer cells are under increased metabolic pressure and therefore more sensitive to inhibition of autophagy than that of normal cells (Karantza-Wadsworth et al., 2007Karantza-Wadsworth V. Patel S. Kravchuk O. Chen G. Mathew R. Jin S. White E. Autophagy mitigates metabolic stress and genome damage in mammary tumorigenesis.Genes Dev. 2007; 21: 1621-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar). Increased activation of autophagy in apoptosis deficient cells has been shown to mediate cell death (Shimizu et al., 2004Shimizu S. Kanaseki T. Mizushima N. Mizuta T. Arakawa-Kobayashi S. Thompson C.B. Tsujimoto Y. Role of Bcl-2 family proteins in a non-apoptotic programmed cell death dependent on autophagy genes.Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 1221-1228Crossref PubMed Scopus (1141) Google Scholar). To test this possibility, we treated Bax/Bak double knockout (DKO) cells with etoposide to induce cell death by DNA damage in the presence or absence of spautin-1. We found that spautin-1 inhibited etoposide induced autophagic cell death of Bax-Bak DKO cells (Figures S3E–S3G). Thus, spautin-1 can be used as a tool to explore the requirement of autophagy in cellular processes. To explore the mechanism by which spautin-1 inhibits autophagy, we first examined the effects of spautin-1 on FYVE-RFP, an indicator for the activity of class III PI3 kinase, because PtdIns3P, the product of class III PI3 kinase, is important for the formation of autophagosomes (Gaullier et al., 1998Gaullier J.M. Simonsen A. D'Arrigo A. Bremnes B. Stenmark H. Aasland R. FYVE fingers bind PtdIns(3)P.Nature. 1998; 394: 432-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar, Simonsen and Tooze, 2009Simonsen A. Tooze S.A. Coordination of membrane events during autophagy by multiple class III PI3-kinase complexes.J. Cell Biol. 2009; 186: 773-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). Treatment with spautin-1 (Figure 3A ) and MBCQ (Figure S4A) reduced the levels of FYVE-RFP puncta, but had no effect on the protein levels of FYVE-RFP (Figure S4B), suggesting that spautin-1 reduced the levels of PtdIns3P. The reduction of PtdIns3P in spautin-1 treated cells was confirmed using lipid dot blot analysis (Gozani et al., 2003Gozani O. Karuman P. Jones D.R. Ivanov D. Cha J. Lugovskoy A.A. Baird C.L. Zhu H. Field S.J. Lessnick S.L. et al.The PHD finger of the chromatin-associated protein ING2 functions as a nuclear phosphoinositide receptor.Cell. 2003; 114: 99-111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar)(Figure 3B). However, spautin-1 does not inhibit the lipid kinase activity of Vps34 in vitro (data not shown). Thus, spautin-1 can reduce the levels of PtdIns3P in cells, but is not a direct inhibitor of class III PI3 kinase activity. Interestingly, we noted that the levels of Flag-Beclin1 and HA-Vps34 were considerably lower in spautin-1 treated cells than that of control cells (Figure 3C). In addition, treatment with spautin-1 also reduced the levels of GFP-p150 and Myc-Atg14L (Figures 3D and 3E). On the other hand, the treatment of spautin-1 had no effect on the protein levels of GFP alone, GFP-Arf1, GFP-MT, EGFR, HA-Hrs, HA-Atg3, or GFP-Atg7 (data not shown). Thus, spautin-1 selectively reduces the levels of exogenously expressed components of Vps34 complexes. To determine if spautin-1 has a similar effect on endogenous Vps34 complexes, we conducted a time course study of H4-LC3-GFP cells treated with spautin-1 by western blotting. We found that the levels of endogenous Beclin1, Vps34, p150, Atg14L, and UVRAG progressively decreased in a time-dependent manner in the presence of spautin-1, and the effect of spautin-1 on the levels of Vps34 complexes was strongly correlated with that of LC3II (Figure 3F). Other active derivatives such as MBCQ have similar activity profiles (data not shown). In contrast, the treatment of 3-MA has no effect on the protein level of Beclin1 (Figure S4C ). These data confirm that spautin-1 selectively reduces the levels of Vps34 complexes in mammalian cells. To explore the mechanism by which spautin-1 reduces the levels of Vps34 complexes, we treated H4-LC3-GFP cells with MBCQ or spautin-1 in the presence or absence of CHX. As shown in Figure 3G, the addition of spautin-1 with CHX reduced the levels of Beclin1 and Vps34 compared to that of CHX alone, suggesting that spautin-1 may promote the degradation of the class III PI3 kinase complexes. To further examine this possibility, we treated H4-LC3-GFP cells with spautin-1 in the presence of MG132 or NH4Cl to inhibit proteasomal or lysosomal degradation, respectively. MG132 but not NH4Cl inhibited the reduction of Beclin1 induced by spautin-1 (Figure 3H). The addition of MG132 restored the levels of Vps34 complexes as well as that of autophagy (Figure S5A ). Similar results were found with transfected GFP-Beclin1 in 293T cells (Figure S5B). These results suggest that spautin-1 promotes the degradation of Beclin1 through the proteasomal pathway. Since ubiquitination represents an essential step in mediating proteasomal degradation, we tested if ubiquitination of Beclin1 was increased in cells treated with spautin-1. As shown in Figure 3I, the treatment of spautin-1 promoted the ubiquitination of Beclin1 without an obvious effect on the global levels of ubiquitination. Taken together, we conclude that spautin-1 inhibits autophagy by selectively promoting the degradation of the class III PI3 kinase complexes via the proteasomal pathway. Since ubiquitination of proteins plays a critical role in mediating proteasomal degradation, we hypothesize that spautin-1 targets deubiquitinating enzyme(s) (DUBs) which normally function to negatively regulate the ubiquitination of Vps34 complexes. This follows from the common finding that a small molecule is more likely to be an inhibitor than an activator. To directly test this hypothesis, we screened a collection of 127 siRNAs targeting Human Deubiquitinating Enzymes from the Dharmacon library SMART pools for inhibition of autophagy using H4-LC3-GFP cells as an assay. We found that only knockdown of USP10 or USP13 showed a consistent effect of reducing the levels of endogenous Vps34, Beclin1, Atg14L, p150 and UVRAG (Figures 4A and 4B). Interestingly, the treatment of spautin-1 also reduced the levels of USP10 and USP13, but not USP14, a DUB involved in regulating proteasome function (Lee et al., 2010Lee B.H. Lee M.J. Park S. Oh D.C. Elsasser S. Chen P.C. Gartner C. Dimova N. Hanna J. Gygi S.P. et al.Enhancement of proteasome activity by a small-molecule inhibitor of USP14.Nature. 2010; 467: 179-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar), or Rubicon, a negative regulator of type III PI3 kinase (Matsunaga et al., 2009Matsunaga K. Saitoh T. Tabata K. Omori H. Satoh T. Kurotori N. Maejima I. Shirahama-Noda K. Ichimura T. Isobe T. et al.Two Beclin 1-binding proteins, Atg14L and Rubicon, reciprocally regulate autophagy at different stages.Nat. Cell Biol. 2009; 11: 385-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (779) Google Scholar, Zhong et al., 2009Zhong Y. Wang Q.J. Li X. Yan Y. Backer J.M. Chait B.T. Heintz N. Yue Z. Distinct regulation of autophagic activity by Atg14L and Rubicon associated with Beclin 1-phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase complex.Nat. Cell Biol. 2009; 11: 468-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar) (Figure 4C). Similarly, the treatment of MEF cells with spautin-1 also led to a time-dependent reduction in the levels of USP10, USP13, Vps34 complexes and autophagy (Figure S5C). In addition, we compared the effects of spautin-1 on HeLa and Bcap-37 cells under normal culture condition and autophagy induction conditions (Figures S5D and S5E). Interestingly, we found that the reduction in the levels of Vps34 complexes in Bcap-37 cells was significantly stronger under autophagy induction conditions than that under normal culture conditions, where autophagy levels are low. Because the reductions in the levels of USP10 and USP13 in H4-LC3-GFP cells treated with spautin-1 appeared later than the reductions in the levels of Vps34 complexes and autophagy (Figure 4C), the reduced levels of USP10 and USP13 are unlikely to be the primary reason for the ability of spautin-1 to reduce the levels of PtdIns3P and inhibit autophagy. Since the treatment with spautin-1 increases the ubiquitination levels of Beclin1 and knockdown of USP10 or USP13 reduces the levels of Vps34 complexes, we considered the possibility that spautin-1 targets USP10 and USP13 mediated the deubiquitination of Vps34 complexes. We first examined the ability of USP10 and USP13 to mediate the deubiquitination of Vps34 complexes. We found that the overexpression of USP10 was highly effective in reducing the levels of ubiquitinated Beclin1, and this effect was inhibited in the presence of spautin-1 (Figure 4D). Similarly, the overexpression of USP13 reduced the levels of ubiquitinated Beclin1 which was inhibited by spautin-1 (Figure 4E). On the other hand, overexpression of USP10 or USP13 had no obvious effects on the ubiquitination levels of overexpressed Vps34, Atg14L, p150, and UVRAG (Figures S6A–S6H ). Taken together, these results suggest that Beclin1 is the primary target of USP10 and USP13. To directly test if spautin-1 can inhibit the deubiquitinating activity of USP10 and USP13, we tested the activity of isolated USP10 and USP13 on ubiquitinated Beclin1 in vitro. As shown in Figures 4F and 4G, the coincubation of ubiquitinated Beclin1 with USP10 or USP13 but not a catalytically inactive USP10 mutant reduced the levels of Beclin1 ubiquitination. Furthermore, the presence of spautin-1 inhibited the deubiquitination of Beclin1 mediated by USP10 and USP13. In contrast, spautin-1 had no effect on CYLD-mediated deubiquitination of RIP1 in vitro (data not shown). To further confirm this result, we developed an in vitro deubiquitination assay using Ub-AMC (the C-terminal derivatization of ubiquitin with 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin), which is a fluorogenic substrate for deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) (Dang et al., 1998Dang L.C. Melandri F.D. Stein R.L. Kinetic and mechanistic studies on the hydrolysis of ubiquitin C-terminal 7-amido-4-methylcoumarin by deubiquitinating enzymes.Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 1868-1879Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Using this assay, we found that spautin-1 inhibited USP10 and USP13 with IC50 of ∼0.6-0.7 μM while having no inhibitory activity toward CYLD which is also a member of ubiquitin specific peptidase family (Figures 4H and 4I). Thus, spautin-1 is an inhibitor of the deubiquitinating activity of USP10 and USP13. Our results suggest that inhibition of USP10 and USP13 by spautin-1 promotes the ubiquitination and degradation of Vps34 complexes which in turn leads to a reduction in the levels of PtdIns3P and consequent inhibition of autophagy. Unexpectedly, we found that the knockdown of Beclin1 or Vps34 could also reduce the endogenous levels of USP10 and USP13 (Figures 5A and 5B ). This suggests that Vps34 complexes may be able to regulate their own levels by stabilizing their cognate deubiquitinating enzymes including USP10 and USP13. This effect is not likely mediated through PtdIns3P, the product of Vps34 complexes, as the treatment of 3-MA which inhibits the kinase activity of class III PI3 kinase had no effect on the levels of USP10 or USP13 (data not shown). Thus, Vps34 complexes have the surprising role of regulating the stability of USP10 and USP13. To determine the mechanism by which Vps34 complexes regulate the stability of USP13 and USP10, we examined the possibility that Beclin1 may interact with USP10 and USP13. We found that endogenous Beclin1 can interact with USP13 and the interaction was reduced in the presence of spautin-1 (Figure 5C). However, the interaction of Beclin1 and USP10 was considerably weaker (data not shown). These data suggest that Beclin1 may closely interact with USP13, whereas its interaction with USP10 is indirect or transient in nature. To further characterize the interaction of USP13 with Beclin1, we determined the domains of Beclin1 that interact with USP13 (Figure 5D & E). Different truncation mutants of Beclin1 were coexpressed with USP13 in 293T cells and the interaction of USP13 with different Beclin1 mutants was analyzed by coimmunoprecipitation. A C-terminal deletion mutant of Beclin1 (ΔC-Beclin1) showed significantly reduced binding with USP13, suggesting the C terminus of Beclin1 is important for the interaction. We further compared the effect of spautin-1 in 293T cells expressing ΔC-Beclin1 mutant or full length Beclin1 (Figures 5F and 5G). Interestingly, we found that not only was the ΔC-Beclin1 mutant resistant to spautin-induced degradation, but the expression of ΔC-Beclin1 mutant significantly blocked the effect of spautin-1 in inhibiting autophagy and inducing the degradation of Vps34. Since ΔC-Beclin1 can bind to Vps34 (Furuya et al., 2010Furuya T. Kim M. Lipinski M. Li J. Kim D. Lu T. Shen Y. Rameh L. Yankner B. Tsai L.H. et al.Negative regulation of Vps34 by Cdk mediated phosphorylation.Mol. Cell. 2010; 38: 500-511Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) but not USP13, this experiment suggests that the interaction of Beclin1 and USP13 is critically important for regulating the stability of Vps34 complexes in response to spautin-1 treatment. To directly examine the mechanism by which Beclin1 regulates USP10 and USP13, we determined the effects of their interaction on the deubiquitinating activities in vitro using Ub-AMC as a substrate. As shown in Figure 5H, the DUB activities of USP10 or USP13 were comparatively low when incubated alone with Ub-AMC. Interestingly, the DUB activities were significantly increased when USP13 and USP10 coincubated together or with Beclin1 or all 3 proteins together, suggesting the DUB activity can be significantly enhanced when USP13 interacts with its substrate Beclin1 or USP10. Thus, reduced levels of USP10 and USP13 in the presence of spautin-1 or with beclin1 knockdown may be due to their increased ubiquitination and degradation through the proteasome pathway. Consistent with this possibility, the effect of spautin-1 on the levels of USP10 and Vps34 complexes can be fully restored in the presence of MG132 (Figure S5A). Furthermore, the effect of Beclin1 knockdown on reduced levels of USP10 and USP13 can also be inhibited by MG132 (Figure S7B ). Since the treatment of spautin-1 also led to reduced levels of USP10, which was inhibited by the addition of MG132 (Figure S5A), it is likely that the levels of USP10 and USP13 are also regulated by ubiquitina"
https://openalex.org/W2030835712,"Changes in redox status are a conspicuous feature of immune responses in a variety of eukaryotes, but the associated signalling mechanisms are not well understood. In plants, attempted microbial infection triggers the rapid synthesis of nitric oxide and a parallel accumulation of reactive oxygen intermediates, the latter generated by NADPH oxidases related to those responsible for the pathogen-activated respiratory burst in phagocytes. Both nitric oxide and reactive oxygen intermediates have been implicated in controlling the hypersensitive response, a programmed execution of plant cells at sites of attempted infection. However, the molecular mechanisms that underpin their function and coordinate their synthesis are unknown. Here we show genetic evidence that increases in cysteine thiols modified using nitric oxide, termed S-nitrosothiols, facilitate the hypersensitive response in the absence of the cell death agonist salicylic acid and the synthesis of reactive oxygen intermediates. Surprisingly, when concentrations of S-nitrosothiols were high, nitric oxide function also governed a negative feedback loop limiting the hypersensitive response, mediated by S-nitrosylation of the NADPH oxidase, AtRBOHD, at Cys 890, abolishing its ability to synthesize reactive oxygen intermediates. Accordingly, mutation of Cys 890 compromised S-nitrosothiol-mediated control of AtRBOHD activity, perturbing the magnitude of cell death development. This cysteine is evolutionarily conserved and specifically S-nitrosylated in both human and fly NADPH oxidase, suggesting that this mechanism may govern immune responses in both plants and animals."
https://openalex.org/W2097627856,"Whereas chromosomal translocations are common pathogenetic events in cancer, mechanisms that promote them are poorly understood. To elucidate translocation mechanisms in mammalian cells, we developed high-throughput, genome-wide translocation sequencing (HTGTS). We employed HTGTS to identify tens of thousands of independent translocation junctions involving fixed I-SceI meganuclease-generated DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) within the c-myc oncogene or IgH locus of B lymphocytes induced for activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID)-dependent IgH class switching. DSBs translocated widely across the genome but were preferentially targeted to transcribed chromosomal regions. Additionally, numerous AID-dependent and AID-independent hot spots were targeted, with the latter comprising mainly cryptic I-SceI targets. Comparison of translocation junctions with genome-wide nuclear run-ons revealed a marked association between transcription start sites and translocation targeting. The majority of translocation junctions were formed via end-joining with short microhomologies. Our findings have implications for diverse fields, including gene therapy and cancer genomics."

Kir channels play an essential role in many physiological processes, including neuronal signaling, kidney function, insulin secretion, and heart rate control. Mutations of Kir channels underlie numerous diseases including primary aldosteronism, Andersen syndrome, Bartter syndrome, and congenital hyperinsulinism (Choi et al., 2011Choi M. Scholl U.I. Yue P.

All Kir channels share the same basic topology: four subunits combine to form a canonical K+ pore-forming transmembrane domain (TMD) and a large cytoplasmic domain (CTD) (Figure 1A ). It is thought that ion conduction may be regulated by two gates in series: one formed by the inner helices of the TMD (Doyle et al., 1998Doyle D.A. Morais Cabral J. Pfuetzner R.A. Kuo A. Gulbis J.M.

Neurosci. 2005; 8: 279-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Various regulatory molecules are thought to control these gates, but the control mechanisms are still unknown. The anionic lipid phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) is essential for the activation of all Kir channels (Hibino et al., 2010Hibino H. Inanobe A. Furutani K. Murakami S. Findlay I.

GIRK channel activation elicits the flow of K+ ions across the cell membrane and thus drives the membrane voltage toward the Nernst potential for K+. Near the K+ Nernst potential, voltage-dependent Na+ and Ca2+ channels tend to be silenced and therefore electrical excitation is diminished. This is an important signaling mechanism by which hormone and neurotransmitter stimulation of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) regulates many essential physiological processes (Lüscher and Slesinger, 2010Lüscher C.

Neurosci. 2010; 11: 301-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). For example, acetylcholine secreted by the vagus nerve controls heart rate through stimulation of muscarinic GPCRs in cardiac pacemaker cells (Logothetis et al., 1987Logothetis D.E. Kurachi Y.

Electrophysiological studies have sought to understand how the various ligands—G proteins, PIP2, and Na+—interact simultaneously with GIRK channels to regulate their gating. These studies suggest that G proteins and Na+ function in a codependent manner with PIP2 to open GIRK channels (Huang et al., 1998Huang C.L. Feng S. Hilgemann D.W.

Activation of inwardly rectifying K+ channels by distinct PtdIns(4,5)P2 interactions.Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 183-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Here, we present crystal structures of a quiescent, closed GIRK2 channel and of a point mutant that is constitutively active, independent of G protein stimulation. Further, both structures are determined in the absence and presence of PIP2. These structures render a molecular mechanistic description of multi-ligand regulation of GIRK channels. Four GIRK channel isoforms (Kir3.1–Kir3.4) associate into various homo-/heterotetrameric complexes. GIRK2 (Kir3.2) forms functional homotetramers and is thus a good candidate for crystallographic structure determination (Kofuji et al., 1995Kofuji P. Davidson N. Lester H.A.

To obtain suitably diffracting crystals, we modified the mouse GIRK2 complementary DNA (cDNA) to remove unstructured regions of the N and C termini (Nishida et al., 2007Nishida M. Cadene M.

The resulting channel differs from the corresponding human ortholog by only one amino acid near the structured end of the C terminus (Asn377 is Ser in human GIRK2) (Figure S2 available online). This channel with unstructured regions of the N and C termini removed, which we refer to as wild-type in this study, exhibits the fundamental characteristics of the full-length GIRK2: G protein activation, inhibition by tertiapin-Q, and a strongly rectifying current-voltage curve (Figures 1C and 1D). Wild-type GIRK2 crystals diffracted X-rays to 3.6 Å resolution. Initial phases were determined by molecular replacement with a GIRK2 CTD structure, and a model was built and refined to working and free residuals (Rw/Rf) of 26.0%/27.3% (Figures 1A and 1B and Table S1) (Inanobe et al., 2007Inanobe A. Matsuura T. Nakagawa A. Kurachi Y. Structural diversity in the cytoplasmic region of G protein-gated inward rectifier K+ channels.Channels (Austin). 2007; 1: 39-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The overall architecture of GIRK2 is similar to the G protein-independent “classical inward rectifier” channel Kir2.2 (Tao et al., 2009Tao X. Avalos J.L. Chen J. MacKinnon R. Crystal structure of the eukaryotic strong inward-rectifier K+ channel Kir2.2 at 3.1 A resolution.Science. 2009; 326: 1668-1674Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar), but has two significant differences. First, the turrets surrounding the extracellular entryway to the pore form a wider, more open vestibule in GIRK2 (Figures S1B and S1C ). This structural difference may provide a simple explanation for pharmacological differences between classical inward rectifiers and GIRK channels. Many GIRK channels, including GIRK2, are inhibited by certain pore-blocking toxins such as tertiapin, as shown in Figure 1C, whereas classical inward rectifier channels are not (Jin and Lu, 1999Jin W. Lu Z. Synthesis of a stable form of tertiapin: a high-affinity inhibitor for inward-rectifier K+ channels.Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 14286-14293Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The more open turrets in GIRK2 would allow tertiapin to fit into the vestibule, whereas the more restrictive turrets in classical inward rectifiers appear to prevent toxin binding. The second structural difference occurs at the interface between the TMD and CTD. In Kir2.2 the CTD is extended away from the TMD in the absence of PIP2, whereas in GIRK2 the two components are tightly juxtaposed (Figures 1A and 1B and Figure S1A) (Tao et al., 2009Tao X. Avalos J.L. Chen J. MacKinnon R. Crystal structure of the eukaryotic strong inward-rectifier K+ channel Kir2.2 at 3.1 A resolution.Science. 2009; 326: 1668-1674Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). The TMD-CTD interface in GIRK2 is mediated by both hydrophilic and hydrophobic interactions between the interfacial helices of the TMD, the TM-CTD linker, and the βC-βD loop of the CTD (Figure 1B). These interactions were absent in the more extended Kir2.2 structure (Tao et al., 2009Tao X. Avalos J.L. Chen J. MacKinnon R. Crystal structure of the eukaryotic strong inward-rectifier K+ channel Kir2.2 at 3.1 A resolution.Science. 2009; 326: 1668-1674Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). It seems likely that they play an important role in the control of GIRK2 channel activity because they are in close proximity to the two constrictions along the ion pathway that have been hypothesized to function as gates. One gate—the inner helix gate—is formed by the inner helices of the TMD, just inside the membrane, above the level of the interfacial helix (Figure 1A and Figure S1A). Another gate—the G loop gate—is formed by the G loop at the apex of the CTD, just outside the membrane, below the level of the interfacial helix (Figure 1A and Figure S1A). In this structure of GIRK2, both gates are tightly closed. Near the TMD-CTD interface, immediately beneath the βC-βD loop, there is electron density that cannot be attributed to protein atoms (Figure 2A ). Given the surrounding protein chemical groups, this density most likely represents either a metal ion, for example Na+, or a water molecule. To distinguish between these possibilities, we crystallized the channel in the presence of Tl+, a monovalent metal ion identifiable by its X-ray anomalous signal, which has been used previously to analyze the Na+ binding site in the transport protein LeuT (Boudker et al., 2007Boudker O. Ryan R.M. Yernool D. Shimamoto K. Gouaux E. Coupling substrate and ion binding to extracellular gate of a sodium-dependent aspartate transporter.Nature. 2007; 445: 387-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). An anomalous peak, the third strongest in the anomalous difference electron density map (4.6 σ, after sites in the selectivity filter and at the intracellular pore entryway), identifies this extra density as a metal cation (Figure 2B). In the native structure, the density is undoubtedly due to a Na+ ion coming from the crystallization solution of 1M NaCl. The discovery of a Na+ binding site is interesting because GIRK channels that contain either Kir3.2 or Kir3.4 subunits are known to be activated by elevated levels of intracellular Na+ with an EC50 of 30–40 mM (Ho and Murrell-Lagnado, 1999aHo I.H.

Sodium activation of GIRK channels is thought to serve an important physiological function by producing negative feedback on excessive electrical excitability: during excitation, Na+ entry can elevate intracellular Na+ concentrations above the normal range of 5–15 mM, enough to activate GIRK channels and drive the membrane potential negative again. Mutagenesis studies have pinpointed an aspartic acid in the βC-βD loop as a critical determinant of Na+ activation (Asp228 in Kir3.2), and the presence of aspartic acid rather than asparagine accounts for the Na+ sensitivity of GIRK channels with Kir3.2 or Kir3.4 subunits (Ho and Murrell-Lagnado, 1999aHo I.H.

Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 183-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar) (Figure S2). Asp228 is one of the coordinating residues of the Na+ site in the crystal structure, and when Asp228 is mutated to asparagine the Na+ density is no longer observed (Figure 2C). This direct correlation between structure and function observed when mutating Asp228 suggests that we have identified the regulatory Na+ binding site. In the refined model, Na+ is coordinated not only by the side chain carboxylate of Asp 228, but also by main chain carbonyl oxygen atoms from Arg230, Asn231, and Ser232 (Figures 2A and 2D). Main chain carbonyls from Leu275 and Val276 in the βE-βG loop may also participate, as well as the flanking histidines (His69 and His233), which may help to coordinate a water molecule near this site. As we present additional data below, it will become clear why this Na+ ion is strategically located in the channel to modulate gating. We suspected that the TMD-CTD interface is likely to play an important role in controlling the channel's gates, and in particular in transmitting conformational changes that allow G proteins to regulate the gates. Using the closed structure of GIRK2 to guide our experiments, we introduced point mutations into the TMD-CTD interface and assessed their effects using a functional assay developed by Jan and coworkers (Kubo et al., 1993Kubo Y. Reuveny E. Slesinger P.A. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Primary structure and functional expression of a rat G-protein-coupled muscarinic potassium channel.Nature. 1993; 364: 802-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar). In this assay, the GIRK2 channel was coexpressed in Xenopus oocytes with the M2 muscarinic G protein-coupled receptor (Kubo et al., 1993Kubo Y. Reuveny E. Slesinger P.A. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Primary structure and functional expression of a rat G-protein-coupled muscarinic potassium channel.Nature. 1993; 364: 802-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar). Stimulation of the M2 receptor by acetylcholine (ACh) causes GIRK2 channel opening, mediated by endogenous G proteins in the oocyte. When the wild-type GIRK2 channel is expressed, acetylcholine application stimulates large K+ currents (Figure 1C). Subsequent application of tertiapin-Q (TPN-Q) distinguishes GIRK2 currents from endogenous oocyte channel currents. For the wild-type channel, the magnitude of current stimulated by acetylcholine nearly equals that inhibited by TPN-Q, which means there is little or no G protein-independent GIRK2 current (Figure 1C). Mutations in the TMD-CTD interface were introduced at many of the most conserved positions and in a number of cases the mutations we chose corresponded to naturally occurring mutants that underlie channelopathies (Decher et al., 2007Decher N.

Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 183-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar) (Figure S2). Not surprisingly, the majority of these mutations yielded nonfunctional GIRK2 channels (listed in the Figure 3 legend). The mutations that did express are shown in Figure 3A. Grey bars show that functional expression levels in each case are comparable to those in the wild-type, while black bars show the fraction of GIRK2 current that is stimulated by the addition of acetylcholine. This fraction is near unity for the wild-type and four of the mutants (Figure 3A). In contrast, the R201A mutation stands out because its acetylcholine-stimulated fraction is less than 0.2, which means that its activity is largely independent of acetylcholine (Figure 3B). To analyze the structural alterations underlying constitutive activation in the R201A mutant, we determined its crystal structure at 3.1 Å resolution. Compared to wild-type, this channel shows a large rearrangement of the βC-βD loop, movement of the His233 side chain to fill the void left by deletion of the Arg201 side chain, and a shifting of the strand comprising residues 235–237 to interact more closely with residues 272–275 of the βE-βG loop (Figure 3C). These conformational changes are associated with a displacement and rotation of the G loop and a change in the positions of three amino acids that form the gate's constriction: Met313, Gly318, and Met319 (Figures 3D and 3E and Movie S1). The net effect of these concerted changes is a widening of the G loop gate from about 6.0 Å to nearly 12.0 Å, and the appearance of oxygen atoms from the Gly318 main-chain carbonyl and the Thr320 side chain to face the pore (Figures 3D and 3E). These conformational changes effectively create a 9 Å diameter hydrophilic pore (as delimited by the van der Waals surfaces of the pore-lining oxygen atoms), which should be sufficient to allow passage of an 8 Å diameter hydrated K+ ion. The R201A mutant also shows a propagated conformational change that extends to the perimeter of the CTD, a distance of approximately 30 Å from the site of the R201A mutation, and encompasses the Na+ binding site (Figure 4 and Movie S1). This propagated conformational change is mediated by a domino-like displacement of β strands, which in turn leads to a reorganization of several hydrophobic amino acids (Val67, Leu257, and Val276) and a rotamer switch in the conformation of the Tyr58 side chain near the CTD perimeter. Several independent lines of evidence suggest that this propagated conformational change is similar to the conformational change that occurs when G proteins bind to the channel. First, site-directed mutagenesis studies of GIRK/Kir2.1 chimeric channels have identified several buried and surface resides as being essential in mediating G protein activation of GIRK channels. The critical surface residues are located around the βL-βM loop of the CTD, especially residue Leu344, thus implicating this region as a binding site for G proteins (Finley et al., 2004Finley M. Arrabit C. Fowler C. Suen K.F. Slesinger P.A. betaL-betaM loop in the C-terminal domain of G protein-activated inwardly rectifying K(+) channels is important for G(betagamma) subunit activation.J.

Identification of a potassium channel site that interacts with G protein betagamma subunits to mediate agonist-induced signaling.J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12517-12524Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is reasonable to think that G protein binding to this region could regulate this conformational change, leading to G loop gate opening. It was also shown that mutation of the buried residue Leu273 to isoleucine eliminated G protein activation (He et al., 2002He C. Yan X. Zhang H. Mirshahi T. Jin T. Huang A. Logothetis D.E. Identification of critical residues controlling G protein-gated inwardly rectifying K(+) channel activity through interactions with the beta gamma subunits of G proteins.J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6088-6096Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Until now, it was unclear how this would affect channel function, but here we can see that Leu273 is located on the βE-βG loop next to Val276 and that it undergoes a significant conformational change in the R201A mutant. It is conceivable that a mutation at this position could alter the propagation of a conformational change from the surface of the protein to the G loop. Second, NMR studies of the interaction between G protein subunits and the GIRK1 CTD using transferred cross saturation and chemical shift perturbation experiments have identified regions on the CTD that either directly contact a G protein or undergo a conformational change in response to G protein binding (Yokogawa et al., 2011Yokogawa M. Osawa M. Takeuchi K. Mase Y. Shimada I. NMR analyses of the Gbetagamma binding and conformational rearrangements of the cytoplasmic pore of G protein-activated inwardly rectifying potassium channel 1 (GIRK1).J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 2215-2223Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). These studies concluded that G proteins bind to a surface mainly comprised of the βL-βM and βD-βE loops (Figure S3B ). They also concluded that G protein binding elicits conformational changes near this surface as well as at locations within the N terminus, especially Tyr58 (Figures S3C and S3D). The NMR data match the conformational changes that we ob"

Lu et al. use viral barcoding and high-throughput sequencing to track the differentiation of single hematopoietic stem cells in vivo. Disentangling cellular heterogeneity is a challenge in many fields, particularly in the stem cell and cancer biology fields. Here we demonstrate how to combine viral genetic barcoding with high-throughput sequencing to track single cells in a heterogeneous population. We use this technique to track the in vivo differentiation of unitary hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). The results are consistent with single-cell transplantation studies but require two orders of magnitude fewer mice. In addition to its high throughput, the high sensitivity of the technique allows for a direct examination of the clonality of sparse cell populations such as HSCs. We show how these capabilities offer a clonal perspective of the HSC differentiation process. In particular, our data suggest that HSCs do not equally contribute to blood cells after irradiation-mediated transplantation, and that two distinct HSC differentiation patterns co-exist in the same recipient mouse after irradiation. This technique can be applied to any virus-accessible cell type for both in vitro and in vivo processes."
https://openalex.org/W2048611034,"Cullin-RING ligases (CRLs) represent the largest E3 ubiquitin ligase family in eukaryotes, and the identification of their substrates is critical to understanding regulation of the proteome. Using genetic and pharmacologic Cullin inactivation coupled with genetic (GPS) and proteomic (QUAINT) assays, we have identified hundreds of proteins whose stabilities or ubiquitylation status are regulated by CRLs. Together, these approaches yielded many known CRL substrates as well as a multitude of previously unknown putative substrates. We demonstrate that one substrate, NUSAP1, is an SCFCyclin F substrate during S and G2 phases of the cell cycle and is also degraded in response to DNA damage. This collection of regulated substrates is highly enriched for nodes in protein interaction networks, representing critical connections between regulatory pathways. This demonstrates the broad role of CRL ubiquitylation in all aspects of cellular biology and provides a set of proteins likely to be key indicators of cellular physiology."

B lymphocytes are particularly prone to translocation-induced malignancy, and mature B cell lymphomas are the most common lymphoid cancer (Kuppers, 2005Kuppers R. Mechanisms of B-cell lymphoma pathogenesis.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2005; 5: 251-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar). This enhanced susceptibility appears to be the direct consequence of activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) expression in activated B cells (Nussenzweig and Nussenzweig, 2010Nussenzweig A.

Here, we describe a novel, genome-wide strategy to document primary chromosomal rearrangements. We provide insight into the effects of genomic position and transcription on the genesis of chromosomal rearrangements and DSB resolution. Our data also reveal the extent of recurrent AID-mediated translocations in activated B cells. To discover the extent and nature of chromosomal rearrangements in activated B lymphocytes we developed an assay to capture and sequence rearranged genomic DNA (TC-Seq). In this system, DSBs are induced at the c-myc (chromosome 15) or IgH (chromosome 12) loci, which were engineered to harbor the I-SceI meganuclease target sequence (Robbiani et al., 2008Robbiani D.F. Bothmer A. Callen E. Reina-San-Martin B. Dorsett Y. Difilippantonio S. Bolland D.J. Chen H.T. Corcoran A.E. Nussenzweig A. et al.AID is required for the chromosomal breaks in c-myc that lead to c-myc/IgH translocations.Cell. 2008; 135: 1028-1038Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). c-mycI-SceI/I-SceI or IgHI-SceI/I-SceI (hereafter referred to as MycI and IgHI) B cells were stimulated and infected with a retrovirus expressing I-SceI, in the presence or absence of AID. Rearrangements to I-SceI sites were recovered by semi-nested ligation-mediated PCR from genomic DNA that had been fragmented, A-tailed (to prevent intramolecular ligation) and ligated to asymmetric DNA linkers (Figure 1). Site-specific primers were placed at least 150 bp from the I-SceI site allowing for the capture of rearrangements involving moderate end-processing. PCR products were submitted for high-throughput paired-end sequencing and reads were aligned to the mouse genome. Identical reads were clustered as single events. Since sonication generates unique linker ligation points in each cell, this method allows for the study of independent events without sequencing through rearrangement breakpoints. In the absence of AID, DSBs arise as by-products of normal cellular metabolism including transcription and DNA replication (Branzei and Foiani, 2010Branzei D. Foiani M. Maintaining genome stability at the replication fork.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2010; 11: 208-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar). Consistent with a global distribution of DSBs, we mapped 28,548 unique rearrangements between the I-SceI site and every chromosome in MycIAID−/− B cells (100 million cells assayed, Figure 2A ). To determine whether there is a genome-wide bias for rearrangement, these events were characterized based on location, transcription and histone modification of the locus. We found a marked enrichment of intrachromosomal rearrangements on chromosome 15, with approximately 125 events per mappable megabase (11,066 rearrangements), or ∼40% of all events (Figure 2B). Translocations between MycI and other chromosomes were evenly distributed throughout the genome (Figure 2B and Table S1). Notably, 86.7% (9591 of 11,066) of all intrachromosomal rearrangements were localized within a 350 kb domain surrounding the I-SceI site (from −50 kb to +300 kb; Figure 2C). This is consistent with the observation that 92% of intrachromosomal rearrangements in the breast cancer genome involve aberrant joining of DSBs within 2 Mb of each other (Stephens et al., 2009Stephens P.J. McBride D.J. Lin M.L. Varela I. Pleasance E.D. Simpson J.T. Stebbings L.A. Leroy C. Edkins S. Mudie L.J. et al.Complex landscapes of somatic rearrangement in human breast cancer genomes.Nature. 2009; 462: 1005-1010Crossref PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar), and that 87% of RAG-mediated intrachromosomal rearrangements in Abl-transformed pre-B cells lie within 200 kb of a recombination substrate (Mahowald et al., 2009Mahowald G.K. Baron J.M. Mahowald M.A. Kulkarni S. Bredemeyer A.L. Bassing C.H. Sleckman B.P. Aberrantly resolved RAG-mediated DNA breaks in Atm-deficient lymphocytes target chromosomal breakpoints in cis.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2009; 106: 18339-18344Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The asymmetrical distribution of events in the direction of c-myc transcription and the adjacent Pvt1 gene is also consistent with the idea that gene expression facilitates rearrangement (Thomas and Rothstein, 1989Thomas B.J. Rothstein R. Elevated recombination rates in transcriptionally active DNA.Cell. 1989; 56: 619-630Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1344) Google Scholar). I-SceI-proximal events may be the result of either resection and rejoining of I-SceI breaks, bona fide rearrangements between I-SceI and random DSBs, or a combination of DNA end resection and balanced translocations. Regardless of the precise molecular mechanism, the abundance of these events reveals a strong preference for DSBs to be resolved by ligation to a proximal sequence, a DNA repair strategy that may minimize gross genomic alterations. Recent cancer genome sequencing experiments uncovered a modest but highly significant preference for cancer-associated rearrangements to occur in genes, which compose only 41% of the human genome. For example, in 24 sequenced breast cancer genomes, 50% of all rearrangements involved genes (Stephens et al., 2009Stephens P.J. McBride D.J. Lin M.L. Varela I. Pleasance E.D. Simpson J.T. Stebbings L.A. Leroy C. Edkins S. Mudie L.J. et al.Complex landscapes of somatic rearrangement in human breast cancer genomes.Nature. 2009; 462: 1005-1010Crossref PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar). Whether this bias resulted from selection or some inherent feature of DSB formation and repair specific to cancer cells could not be determined. To ascertain whether a similar bias is seen in primary cells in short term cultures, AID-independent rearrangements in MycIAID−/− B lymphocytes (excluding 1 Mb of DNA around the I-SceI site) were classified as genic or intergenic. Consistent with the human tumor studies, 51% (9677 of 19,246) of the events were associated with genes (Figure 3A ). Because only 40% of the mouse genome is genic, this represents a small (1.25-fold) but significant difference (permutation test p < 0.001) relative to intergenic regions. Moreover, the genic rearrangements were particularly enriched at transcription start sites (Figure 3B). Consistent with the preference for genic rearrangements, we also observed a bias to transcribed genes. Fewer rearrangements than expected occurred at silent (fe = 0.74, p < 0.001) and trace (fe = 0.95, p < 0.001) transcribed genes, while more than expected occurred at low (fe = 1.08 p < 0.001), medium (fe = 1.13, p < 0.001), and highly (fe = 1.14, p < 0.001) transcribed genes (Figure 3C and Figure S1). Additionally, rearrangements were enriched in genes bearing PolII and activating histone marks such as H3K4 trimethylation, H3 acetylation, and H3K36 trimethylation (p < 0.001, Figure 3D). Thus, there is a propensity for a DSB to recombine with gene rich regions of the genome and more specifically to transcription start sites of actively transcribed genes. Processing of AID-induced U:G mismatches can result in DSBs in Ig and non-Ig genes such as c-myc (Robbiani et al., 2008Robbiani D.F. Bothmer A. Callen E. Reina-San-Martin B. Dorsett Y. Difilippantonio S. Bolland D.J. Chen H.T. Corcoran A.E. Nussenzweig A. et al.AID is required for the chromosomal breaks in c-myc that lead to c-myc/IgH translocations.Cell. 2008; 135: 1028-1038Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). To determine whether AID-mediated DSBs can be captured by TC-Seq we examined the IgH and c-myc loci in B cells expressing retrovirally encoded AID (IgHIAIDRV or MycIAIDRV). IgHI B cells expressing both I-SceI and AID showed extensive AID-dependent rearrangement between the I-SceI site and downstream switch (S) regions (Figure 4A ). The frequency of rearrangements resembled the pattern of AID-mediated CSR in LPS+IL-4 cultures (e.g., IgG1≫IgG3>IgE), with 18,686 mapping to Sγ1, 3,192 to Sγ3, and 1433 to Sɛ (Table S2). Furthermore, translocations between c-myc and IgH were entirely dependent on AID (Figures 4B and 4C). In two biological replicate samples totaling 100 million B cells, we observed 45 translocations from IgHI to c-myc (the I-SceI DSB was in IgH), and 5963 from MycI to IgH (the I-SceI DSB was in c-myc) (Table S2). Additionally, TC-Seq tags mapping to c-myc from IgHI correlate well with c-myc/IgH translocation breakpoints sequenced from primary B cells (Figure 4C) (Robbiani et al., 2008Robbiani D.F. Bothmer A. Callen E. Reina-San-Martin B. Dorsett Y. Difilippantonio S. Bolland D.J. Chen H.T. Corcoran A.E.

This suggests that TC-Seq reads are an accurate proxy for breakpoints. Furthermore, the data corroborate previous findings showing that AID induced breaks at c-myc are rate limiting for c-myc/IgH translocations (Robbiani et al., 2008Robbiani D.F. Bothmer A. Callen E. Reina-San-Martin B. Dorsett Y. Difilippantonio S. Bolland D.J. Chen H.T. Corcoran A.E.

We conclude that TC-Seq captures rearrangements and translocations between DSBs in IgHI or MycI and known AID targets. As was the case for AID deficient samples, MycIAIDRV and IgHIAIDRV libraries were enriched in intrachromosomal rearrangements: 17% (10,633 of 63,772 total events) for MycI and 70% (36,019 of 51,312) for IgHI (Table S1 and Figures S2A and S2B). The difference in enrichment between the two was mostly the result of AID activity on chromosome 12, which generated a large number of rearrangements to IgH variable and constant domains (Figure 4A). Expression of AID did not alter the distribution of events around MycI, with 72.5% (7707 of 10,633) mapping within −50 kb to 300 kb of the break (Figure S2C ). A notable exception was an additional cluster of rearrangements associated with Pvt1 exon 5 (Figure S2C). These events coincided precisely with documented chromosomal translocations isolated from AID sufficient mouse plasmacytomas (Cory et al., 1985Cory S. Graham M. Webb E. Corcoran L. Adams J.M. Variant (6;15) translocations in murine plasmacytomas involve a chromosome 15 locus at least 72 kb from the c-myc oncogene.EMBO J. 1985; 4: 675-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, Huppi et al., 1990Huppi K. Siwarski D. Skurla R. Klinman D. Mushinski J.F. Pvt-1 transcripts are found in normal tissues and are altered by reciprocal(6;15) translocations in mouse plasmacytomas.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1990; 87: 6964-6968Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) and likely represent an AID hot spot. In agreement with the MycIAID−/− samples, translocations between IgHI or MycI and other chromosomes were evenly distributed throughout the genome, except for the MycI capture sample, which displayed a marked bias for chromosome 12 due to creation of DSBs at the IgH locus by AID (Figure S2A). Similar to MycIAID−/− samples, rearrangements in both cases were more likely to occur in regions that are genic, transcriptionally active, recruiting PolII, and associated with activating histone marks (Figure 3A and Figures 4D and 4E). Furthermore, intragenic rearrangements were enriched at transcription start sites of genes (Figure S2D). In contrast to recent studies that used Nbs1 as an indirect marker of AID mediated damage (Staszewski et al., 2011Staszewski O. Baker R.E. Ucher A.J. Martier R. Stavnezer J. Guikema J.E. Activation-induced cytidine deaminase induces reproducible DNA breaks at many non-Ig Loci in activated B cells.Mol. Cell. 2011; 41: 232-242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), we found little or no difference in rearrangements to genomic repeats in the presence of AID (Table S3). Thus, AID does not dramatically alter the general profi"

However, fibroblasts represent heterogeneous mesenchymal progenitor cells that potentially contain neural crest lineages, and the cell of origin remained undefined. This raises the fundamental question of whether lineage reprogramming is possible between cell types derived from different germ layers. Here, we demonstrate that terminally differentiated hepatocytes can be directly converted into functional iN cells. Importantly, single-cell and genome-wide expression analyses showed that fibroblast- and hepatocyte-derived iN cells not only induced a neuronal transcriptional program, but also silenced their donor transcriptome. The remaining donor signature decreased over time and could not support functional hepatocyte properties. Thus, the reprogramming factors lead to a binary lineage switch decision rather than an induction of hybrid phenotypes, but iN cells retain a small but detectable epigenetic memory of their donor cells.

MicroRNA-mediated conversion of human fibroblasts to neurons.Nature. 2011; 476: 228-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar). A fundamental question not addressed in these studies is whether both terminally differentiated cells and cells definitely derived from a nonectodermal lineage can be converted into neurons. Primary fibroblast cultures are inherently heterogeneous with respect to both cell type and maturation stage and can contain neural crest cell derivatives. Thus, the identity and the maturation stage of the cells that gave rise to iN cells remained undefined. Given these technical limitations we sought to determine whether better defined and more homogenous cell types can be converted into neuronal cells. Hepatocytes are considered relatively homogeneous and account for 78% of the liver mass (Zhao and Duncan, 2005Zhao R. Duncan S.A. Embryonic development of the liver.Hepatology. 2005; 41: 956-967Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, Braeuning et al., 2006Braeuning A. Ittrich C. Köhle C. Hailfinger S. Bonin M. Buchmann A. Schwarz M. Differential gene expression in periportal and perivenous mouse hepatocytes.FEBS J. 2006; 273: 5051-5061Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Here we show that terminally differentiated mouse hepatocytes can be converted into functional iN cells. This is proof that an endodermal cell can be converted into an ectodermal cell and that a definitely nonectodermal (and nonneural crest) cell can be converted into a functional neuronal cell. A well-characterized and specific Albumin-Cre transgenic mouse line combined with a robust fluorescence-based genetic lineage tracing system allowed us to not only unequivocally demonstrate that Albumin-expressing hepatocytes were the origin of converted neuronal cells, but to also specifically characterize the hepatocyte-derived (Hep-) iN cells and the reprogramming process. Our data show that both mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF)-iN and Hep-iN cells had very efficiently downregulated the MEF and hepatocyte-specific transcriptional network. This result leads to the surprising conclusion that the same neuronal transcription factors can induce the downregulation of two very different transcriptional programs. Similar to that seen in induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), we observed a small degree of epigenetic memory, which diminished over time (Bar-Nur et al., 2011Bar-Nur O. Russ H.A. Efrat S.

Biotechnol. 2010; 28: 848-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (886) Google Scholar). We conclude that iN cells are truly converted cells and not simple hybrid phenotypes between neurons and donor cell types. To test whether cells derived from liver can be induced to become neuronal cells, we established primary liver cultures from postnatal days (P) 2–5 wild-type and TauEGFP knockin mice (Tucker et al., 2001Tucker K.L. Meyer M. Barde Y.A. Neurotrophins are required for nerve growth during development.Nat. Neurosci. 2001; 4: 29-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar, Wernig et al., 2002Wernig M. Tucker K.L.

Res. 2002; 69: 918-924Crossref Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Four days after isolation, the majority of cells showed a typical epithelial morphology and expressed Albumin, α-fetoprotein, and α-anti-trypsin (Figures 1A and 1J , Figure S1A available online). One week after explantation, a typical culture was composed of 60% Albumin-positive hepatocytes, 16% myeloid cells, 2% Kupffer cells, and 2% endothelial cells (Figures S1B and S1D). Absence of the neuronal or neural progenitor cell markers Sox2, Brn2, MAP2, and NeuN in the culture was confirmed by immunofluorescence (data not shown). The rare (∼1/5000) Tuj1-positive cells had a flat morphology, not resembling neuronal cells (Figure S1C). TauEGFP-positive cells were not detectable in these cultures as evaluated by flow cytometry or fluorescence microscopy. The primary liver cultures were then replated and infected with doxycycline (dox)-inducible lentiviruses containing the cDNAs of Ascl1 (A), Brn2 (B), and Myt1l (M) in various combinations. Thirteen days after addition of dox, TauEGFP-positive cells with a complex neuronal morphology were readily detected in the wells that received all three factors (BAM) (Figure 1B). No neuronal cells were found in any other combination (Figure 1K). Immunofluorescence confirmed that all TauEGFP-positive cells generated by the BAM factors were also Tuj1 positive (Figure 1C). When analyzed 3 weeks after infection, the cells could also be labeled with antibodies against PSA-NCAM, NeuN, MAP2, and Synapsin (Figures 1D–1H). A fraction (35 out of 200 counted Tuj1-positive cells) of the cells could also be labeled with an antibody against vesicular glutamate transporter 1 (vGlut1) (Figure 1I). In contrast, no GAD67-, TH-, ChAT-, or serotonin-positive cells were detected (0 out of at least 200 counted Tuj1-positive cells). Because neuronal subtype-specific markers are expressed predominantly in mature stages of neuronal differentiation while Tuj1 labels already early postmitotic immature neurons, we conclude that the majority of mature iN cells are excitatory neurons. Moreover, qRT-PCR analysis showed that TauEGFP-positive iN cells 3 weeks after infection had not only induced neuronal transcripts, but efficiently silenced transcripts characteristic of the starting cell population (Figure 1J). We next employed the Cre-LoxP system to unambiguously identify hepatocytes and their cellular progeny in primary liver cultures. An Albumin-Cre transgenic mouse strain was used that had been characterized extensively and shown to specifically label hepatocytes in both fetal and adult mice (Postic et al., 1999Postic C.

Cre activity in fetal albCre mouse hepatocytes: Utility for developmental studies.Genesis. 2009; 47: 789-792Google Scholar). Albumin-Cre mice were crossed with ROSA26-mTmG reporter mice, which express membranous tdTomato before, and membranous EGFP after, Cre-mediated recombination (Figure 2A ). As expected, the EGFP fluorescence was confined to epithelial cells in freshly isolated liver cultures from these mice (Figure 2B). These cultures were typically composed of ∼80% EGFP-positive and ∼20% tdTomato-positive cells. However, this ratio declined to 60% EGFP-positive 40% tdTomato-positive cells after 1 week in culture, implying that hepatocytes were lost and/or other cells outgrew the hepatocytes. Next, we infected these cultures with the three BAM factors and 13 days after dox induction we detected both red and green fluorescent cells with neuronal morphologies (Figures 2C and 2E). EGFP-positive cells also expressed the neuronal markers Tuj1 and PSA-NCAM (Figures 2D and 2F). Similar results were obtained using an independent reporter allele (ROSA26-Bgeo) (Mao et al., 1999Mao X. Fujiwara Y. Orkin S.H. Improved reporter strain for monitoring Cre recombinase-mediated DNA excisions in mice.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1999; 96: 5037-5042Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar), where expression of β-galactosidase is induced after Cre-mediated recombination (Figures 2G and 2H). These results unequivocally demonstrate that iN cells can be derived from Albumin-expressing hepatocytes. We therefore termed these cells Hep-iN cells. To determine whether mature Hep-iN cells require sustained transgene expression in order to maintain their phenotype, we removed dox from media at different time points after infection. Surprisingly, as few as 5 days of dox treatment sufficed to generate Hep-iN cells, which were present until at least day 22 after addition of dox. Similar results were obtained with MEF-iN cells (Figure 2I). The longer the transgenes were expressed, the more iN cells were generated. Efficiencies appeared to plateau at around 11 days of dox treatment. While the three exogenous factors were strictly dox dependent, the endogenous genes were induced during the reprogramming process (Figure 2J). To investigate whether Hep-iN cells also possessed functional properties of neurons and whether these properties were stable without transgene expression, we performed patch-clamp recordings with cells that were treated with dox for 12 days and cultured for an additional 18 days in dox-free media. Hep-iN cells were identified as EGFP-positive neuronal cells when derived from Albumin-Cre/ROSA26-mTmG mice. We also recorded from Hep-iN cells identified as EGFP/tdTomato-double positive cells when derived from Albumin-Cre/ROSA26-tdTomato/TauEGFP mice (described below, Figure 2K). The average resting membrane potential of the Hep-iN cells was −50.1 ± 2 mV (n = 16). Moreover, spontaneous action potentials were detected in half of the cells (n = 8) (Figure 2L). All analyzed Hep-iN cells generated action potentials when depolarized by current injections (Figure 2M) and showed fast inactivation sodium current and outward potassium currents (Figures S1G and S1H). When Hep-iN cells were FACS-sorted 7 days after dox and cultured together with mouse cortical neuronal cultures for another 4 weeks, postsynaptic responses could be evoked by extracellular stimulation of surrounding neurons (Figure 2N). At holding potentials of −70 mV, a small inward current was detected, presumably mediated by AMPA receptors and/or GABAA receptors. At +60 mV a large outward current was evoked, presumably mediated by NMDA and/or GABAA receptors. To gain insight into the process of iN cell reprogramming, we first evaluated the cell division frequency after induction of the BAM transgenes in liver cultures by a 5-bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation assay. When BrdU was present from the day of infection (i.e., 1 day before dox) throughout the time of iN cell generation, only 12% of the Tuj1-positive cells at day 13 incorporated BrdU. When BrdU treatment was begun on the day of transgene induction (dox addition), only 1% of the Tuj1-positive cells were BrdU positive (Figures 3A and 3B ). Thus, the vast majority of hepatocytes were reprogrammed to iN cells without mitosis. To address the reprogramming kinetics, we generated triple transgenic mice containing the TauEGFP allele together with Albumin-Cre and a ROSA26-tdTomato reporter. In this lineage tracing setting, Albumin-positive hepatocytes and their progeny constitutively express tdTomato while non-hepatocyte-derived cells remain without fluorescent label (Figure 3C and Figure S2A). We established primary hepatocyte cultures from these mice and as expected, 13 days after transduction with the BAM factors, TauEGFP/tdTomato-double positive Hep-iN cells appeared (Figures 3D–3F). Surprisingly, as early as 1 day after transgene expression, some infected hepatocytes expressed TauEGFP (Figures 3G and 3H). Over time the generation of EGFP-positive cells steadily increased, with similar kinetics for hepatocytes and fibroblasts. On day 13, the conversion efficiencies relative to the number of plated cells of hepatocytes were similar to those of postnatal fibroblasts (ca. 6%) but lower than those of embryonic fibroblasts (ca. 20%) (Figure 3H and Supplemental Experimental Procedures). When cultured in keratinocyte serum free media (KSFM), a media reported to prevent dedifferentiation of cultured hepatocytes (Li et al., 2007Li W.C. Ralphs K.L. Slack J.M. Tosh D. Keratinocyte serum-free medium maintains long-term liver gene expression and function in cultured rat hepatocytes by preventing the loss of liver-enriched transcription factors.Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2007; 39: 541-554Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar), we observed conversion efficiencies similar to those seen with our regular hepatocyte growth media (Figures S1E and S1F). Finally, we asked whether iN cell reprogramming could be extended to more mature hepatocytes. Following infection with the BAM viruses, we could generate iN cells from 1-year-old TauEGFP or Albumin-Cre/ROSA26-mT/mG reporter mice. Correcting for an assumed infection rate of 30%, we estimated a conversion efficiency of 2.7% ± 1.4% (Figures S2C–S2E). In order to characterize iN cell formation on the molecular level, we determined the gene expression profiles of FACS-purified iN cells from hepatocytes, MEFs, and tail tip fibroblasts (TTFs) 13 and 22 days after dox using Illumina's MouseRef-8 v2.0 Expression BeadChip microarrays (Figure 4A ). In addition we profiled the starting populations of Albumin-Cre/ROSA26-tdTomato-positive hepatocytes (FACS-sorted) and MEFs as well as those of primary neonatal cortical neurons (CNs) and neurons derived from fetal (E13.5) forebrain neural progenitor cells (NPCs) 7 and 13 days after differentiation, sorted for TauEGFP expression. We first considered only those genes that were differentially expressed (genes with expression changes of at least 3-fold) between hepatocytes, day 22 (d22) Hep-iN cells, and NPC-derived neurons 13 days after differentiation. Unsupervised clustering identified three major clusters of genes and revealed that the vast majority of transcriptional changes in d22 Hep-iN cells approached the levels seen in primary neurons (Figure S3A). The largest cluster (cluster B) contained mostly genes with higher expression levels in Hep-iN cells and neurons than in hepatocytes. Accordingly, in this cluster the top eight most significantly enriched gene ontology (GO) terms are associated with neuronal function and development (Figure S3A). The second largest cluster (cluster C) consisted of mostly those genes downregulated in iN cells and primary neurons (Figure S3A). Within this cluster many GO terms typical of liver function, such as coagulation, wound healing, and inflammatory response, were among the most significantly enriched. The analysis also revealed a cluster of genes that were low in hepatocytes and Hep-iN cells but high in neurons (cluster A). This may indicate a group of genes that failed to be induced in iN cells. Indeed, GO terms associated with more mature neuronal function (regulation of membrane and action potentials in neurons) were significantly enriched in this cluster. However, even more GO terms reflecting glial function were similarly enriched (axon and neuron ensheathment, myelination, lipid biosynthesis, and regulation of action potentials). Thus, (1) contaminating glial cells in the NPC-derived cultures may have contributed to many genes in this cluster, and (2) d22 Hep-iN cells may be less mature than the primary neurons. We then performed unsupervised hierarchical clustering of all samples based on 12,275 genes (Figures 4A and 4B). Most iN cell samples clustered together with the primary neuron samples, indicating that their overall transcriptome is more similar to neurons than to their starting cell types. Surprisingly, NPC-derived neurons were more similar to two iN cell populations (d22 MEF-iN and d22 TTF-iN) than to neonatal CNs. Thus, the transcriptional variability between two different primary neuronal populations was greater than that between iN cells and a specific population of primary neurons. The various iN cell samples fell into three groups: (1) the d22 fibroblast-iN cells, which are most closely approaching primary neurons, (2) d22 Hep-iN cells and d13 fibroblast-iN cells, which are still closer to primary neurons than to fibroblasts or hepatocytes, and (3) d13 Hep-iN cells, which are more similar to hepatocytes than they are to primary neurons. This suggests that hepatocytes are harder to reprogram and need more time to induce a complete neuronal program when compared with fibroblasts. The corresponding heatmap showing expression changes of all the 12,275 genes illustrates the genome-wide remodeling of iN cells toward primary neurons (Figure 4A). In addition, Pearson correlation analysis of genes differentially expressed across all samples by at least 4-fold revealed that d13 MEF-iN and Hep-iN cells are much better correlated (R2 = 0.1987) than MEFs and hepatocytes (R2 = 0.1097) (Figure 4C). Of note, the increased overall correlation is caused by a subset of genes being almost perfectly correlated, while the remaining genes appear uncorrelated and more greatly expressed in Hep-iN cells (Figure 4C). This may suggest that at 13 days the reprogramming factors have induced a portion of the transcriptional program that is similar between Hep-iN and MEF-iN cells. Our preliminary analysis of expression data directly in response to the BAM factors suggests that the correlated genes are not predominantly direct target genes, indicating that the transcription factors induce this pattern through secondary changes (not shown). This is in agreement with the finding that the two different iN cell states become much more similar to each other after 22 days (R2 = 0.2824) and the distinct group of uncorrelated genes decreases (Figure 4C, compare d13 with d22 MEF and Hep-iN cell plots). Conversely, d22 Hep-iN cells and hepatocytes appear quite unrelated (R2 = 0.02104), whereas many genes are well correlated between Hep-iN cells and NPC-derived neurons (R2 = 0.2507) (Figure 4C and Figure S3B). Thus, based on these data the two iN cell samples are more similar to each other than to the donor cell types, and iN cells are gradually and increasingly approximating the state of primary neurons. A key question in lineage reprogramming is whether the induced cell types may represent hybrid phenotypes composed of similarly dominant donor and target cell features, or whether reprogrammed cells have efficiently extinguished the donor cell-specific identity. To test whether the BAM pool of transcription factors were capable of silencing the two donor programs, we first identified a MEF- and liver-specific expression signature by comparing publicly available microarray data from 20 different tissues (Figure S3C). We then evaluated the expression levels of these genes in iN cells and in their donor cells. Strikingly, for both MEF- and Hep-iN cells, those donor-specific programs were extensively downregulated. The MEF signature contained 221 probes, and 209 (95%) and 201 (91%) were downregulated at least 2-fold in MEF-iN cells at days 13 and 22, respectively. Similarly, the liver-specific signature was composed of 149 probes, and 113 (76%) were downregulated at least 2-fold in Hep-iN cells at day 13 and 126 (85%) at day 22 (Figure 4D). To quantify the extent of silencing, we compared expression levels of genes from the liver signature in Hep-iN cells and neurons. Strikingly, as many as 45% of these liver genes could be considered “turned off” (i.e., showed expression levels lower or up to a maximum of 2-fold higher than that in neurons) (Figure S3D). Furthermore, we found that Hep-iN cells have completely lost hepatocyte-specific functional properties such as Albumin secretion and urea production (Figures S2F and S2G). We then asked what the extent of reprogramming in Hep-iN cells is on the single-cell level. Twenty-eight single Hep-iN cells 32 days after dox treatment from two independently infected cultures, thirteen primary TauEGFP-positive CNs cultured for 5 days, and thirteen Albumin-Cre/ROSA26-tdTomato-positive hepatocytes cultured for 6 days were picked and analyzed using Fluidigm dynamic real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) arrays. Figure 4E shows that robust expression of panneuronal markers was found in 27/28 Hep-iN cells (β-III-tubulin, Map2, Ncam). Surprisingly, many primary neurons expressed some of the eight analyzed liver signature genes, illustrating the transcriptional noise of assumed cell type-specific genes. Similar to neurons, Hep-iN cells were randomly positive for one or more liver markers while hepatocytes expressed most of those genes (Figure 4E). When plotting the cells based on how many liver genes were expressed, we found essentially no overlap between hepatocytes and neurons or Hep-iN cells (Figure 4F). On the other hand, the distributions of neurons and Hep-iN cells are overlapping but distinct. Thus, while some Hep-iN cells appear to be indistinguishable from primary neurons, there is a trend that Hep-iN cells express slightly more liver genes than neurons do. This finding shows that Hep-iN cells do not represent hybrid phenotypes of neurons and donor cell types but possess an epigenetic memory of their cells of origin. The lack of detectable hepatic functional properties suggests that this epigenetic memory has little if any functional consequence. In this report we show that Albumin-expressing hepatocytes can be converted into functional neuronal cells. Our results unequivocally prove that terminally differentiated somatic cells can be directly converted into a distantly related somatic cell type. In contrast to previous studies with fibroblasts, we can now formally rule out the possibility that a specific subpopulation potentially enriched in stem or progenitor cells are the origin of iN cells. Also, this demonstrates that cells from definitive endoderm can be directly converted into functional ectodermal cells. Previously, endodermal cells have been reprogrammed to other functional but closely related lineages (Horb et al., 2003Horb M.E. Shen C.N. Tosh D. Slack J.M.

In vivo reprogramming of adult pancreatic exocrine cells to beta-cells.Nature. 2008; 455: 627-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (1536) Google Scholar). Together with the finding that iN cells can be generated also from nonhepatocyte liver cells as well as connective tissue fibroblasts, this raises the possibility that any cell type that can be cultured in vitro may be able to be converted into iN cells using the same or similar reprogramming factors. The fact that the vast majority of hepatocytes are reprogrammed in the absence of cell division argues that the genome-wide transcriptional remodeling is an active process and does not require DNA synthesis. Several aspects were similar between the Hep- and fibroblast-iN cells, such as the expression of glutamatergic markers, reprogramming efficiencies, and timing of the induction of neuronal reporter genes. However, gene profiling revealed that Hep-iN cells required more time to induce a transcriptional neuronal program than fibroblast-iN cells. These findings suggest that besides the key role of the BAM transcription factors, the epigenetic state of the donor cells does have an important influence on the reprogramming process and outcome. It may therefore be possible to identify a more optimal donor cell type for iN cell generation than fibroblasts or hepatocytes, and some donor cell types may be more prone to generate one particular neuronal subtype than others. Finally, we addressed the question of whether iN cells derived from hepatocytes or fibroblasts had not only induced neuronal features but also silenced their donor cell type-specific transcriptional network. We made the remarkable observations that the exact same three transcription factors can efficiently downregulate both a fibroblast- and a liver-specific gene expression program through direct and/or indirect events, and that hepatic functions were extinguished. This result was unexpected given that those transcriptional regulators act in well-defined progenitor cell contexts during development and one would not necessarily have expected a mutually exclusive mechanism for cell type-specific gene expression programs. One possible explanation is that the BAM factors target and inhibit a large number of key lineage-determining factors representing many cell fates. Alternatively, the mutual lineage switch could be caused by a more general mechanism such as competition of the lineage-determining factors with a finite amount of ubiquitously required cofactors, which would lead to an obligatory extinction of any other developmental lineage once differentiating cells have committed to one lineage. The ubiquitously expressed E-proteins could represent such critical cofactors because they are known to heterodimerize with several different lineage-specific bHLH transcription factors (Massari and Murre, 2000Massari M.E. Murre C. Helix-loop-helix proteins: regulators of transcription in eucaryotic organisms.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 429-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (1298) Google Scholar). While our findings reassuringly demonstrate that iN cells predominantly display features of only the target cell lineage, they raise new questions about the molecular mechanisms of cell fate decisions in the embryo and induced by expression of ectopic factors in vitro. Disaggregated mouse liver cells were isolated by an adaptation of the two-step collagenase perfusion technique. Liver was extirpated 2 to 5 days after birth, incised, washed, minced, and digested in Kreb's Ringer Buffer (0.15 mM CalCl2 and 0.54 mg/ml of collagenase type I) (Sigma C0130) for 40 min at 37°C. Cells were centrifuged at 100 × g for 3 min and plated on Collagen-coated plates in hepatocyte plating media. After 4 hr media was changed to hepatocyte culturing media. Neuronal cells were defined as cells that stained positive for Tuj1 and had a process at least three times longer than the cell body.

https://openalex.org/W2027299393,"The question ""what is the observable electromagnetic (EM) signature of a compact binary merger?"" is an intriguing one with crucial consequences to the quest for gravitational waves (GW). Compact binary mergers are prime sources of GW, targeted by current and next generation detectors. Numerical simulations have demonstrated that these mergers eject energetic sub-relativistic (or even relativistic) outflows. This is certainly the case if the mergers produce short GRBs, but even if not, significant outflows are expected. The interaction of such outflows with the surround matter inevitably leads to a long lasting radio signal. We calculate the expected signal from these outflows (our calculations are also applicable to short GRB orphan afterglows) and we discuss their detectability. We show that the optimal search for such signal should, conveniently, take place around 1.4 GHz. Realistic estimates of the outflow parameters yield signals of a few hundred $\mu$Jy, lasting a few weeks, from sources at the detection horizon of advanced GW detectors. Followup radio observations, triggered by GW detection, could reveal the radio remnant even under unfavorable conditions. Upcoming all sky surveys can detect a few dozen, and possibly even thousands, merger remnants at any give time, thereby providing robust merger rate estimates even before the advanced GW detectors become operational. In fact, the radio transient RT 19870422 fits well the overall properties predicted by our model and we suggest that its most probable origin is a compact binary merger radio remnant."

https://openalex.org/W2068485163,"A basic difficulty for the nervous system is integrating locally ambiguous sensory information to form accurate perceptions about the outside world. This local-to-global problem is also fundamental to motor control of the arm, because complex mechanical interactions between shoulder and elbow allow a particular amount of motion at one joint to arise from an infinite combination of shoulder and elbow torques. Here we show, in humans and rhesus monkeys, that a transcortical pathway through primary motor cortex (M1) resolves this ambiguity during fast feedback control. We demonstrate that single M1 neurons of behaving monkeys can integrate shoulder and elbow motion information into motor commands that appropriately counter the underlying torque within about 50 milliseconds of a mechanical perturbation. Moreover, we reveal a causal link between M1 processing and multi-joint integration in humans by showing that shoulder muscle responses occurring ∼50 milliseconds after pure elbow displacement can be potentiated by transcranial magnetic stimulation. Taken together, our results show that transcortical processing through M1 permits feedback responses to express a level of sophistication that rivals voluntary control; this provides neurophysiological support for influential theories positing that voluntary movement is generated by the intelligent manipulation of sensory feedback."
https://openalex.org/W2167968191,"Calcineurin inhibitors (CNIs) are immunosuppressive drugs that are used widely to prevent rejection of transplanted organs and to treat autoimmune disease. Hypertension and renal tubule dysfunction, including hyperkalemia, hypercalciuria and acidosis, often complicate their use. These side effects resemble familial hyperkalemic hypertension, a genetic disease characterized by overactivity of the renal sodium chloride cotransporter (NCC) and caused by mutations in genes encoding WNK kinases. We hypothesized that CNIs induce hypertension by stimulating NCC. In wild-type mice, the CNI tacrolimus caused salt-sensitive hypertension and increased the abundance of phosphorylated NCC and the NCC-regulatory kinases WNK3, WNK4 and SPAK. We demonstrated the functional importance of NCC in this response by showing that tacrolimus did not affect blood pressure in NCC-knockout mice, whereas the hypertensive response to tacrolimus was exaggerated in mice overexpressing NCC. Moreover, hydrochlorothiazide, an NCC-blocking drug, reversed tacrolimus-induced hypertension. These observations were extended to humans by showing that kidney transplant recipients treated with tacrolimus had a greater fractional chloride excretion in response to bendroflumethiazide, another NCC-blocking drug, than individuals not treated with tacrolimus; renal NCC abundance was also greater. Together, these findings indicate that tacrolimus-induced chronic hypertension is mediated largely by NCC activation, and suggest that inexpensive and well-tolerated thiazide diuretics may be especially effective in preventing the complications of CNI treatment."

https://openalex.org/W2103972950,"The efficient and timely resolution of DNA recombination intermediates is essential for bipolar chromosome segregation. Here, we show that the specialized chromosome segregation patterns of meiosis and mitosis, which require the coordination of recombination with cell-cycle progression, are achieved by regulating the timing of activation of two crossover-promoting endonucleases. In yeast meiosis, Mus81-Mms4 and Yen1 are controlled by phosphorylation events that lead to their sequential activation. Mus81-Mms4 is hyperactivated by Cdc5-mediated phosphorylation in meiosis I, generating the crossovers necessary for chromosome segregation. Yen1 is also tightly regulated and is activated in meiosis II to resolve persistent Holliday junctions. In yeast and human mitotic cells, a similar regulatory network restrains these nuclease activities until mitosis, biasing the outcome of recombination toward noncrossover products while also ensuring the elimination of any persistent joint molecules. Mitotic regulation thereby facilitates chromosome segregation while limiting the potential for loss of heterozygosity and sister-chromatid exchanges."

However, it is unknown how saturated and unsaturated FA are discriminated. We now demonstrate that saturated FA activate JNK and inhibit insulin signaling through c-Src activation. FA alter the membrane distribution of c-Src, causing it to partition into intracellular membrane subdomains, where it likely becomes activated. Conversely, unsaturated FA with known beneficial effects on glucose metabolism prevent c-Src membrane partitioning and activation, which are dependent on its myristoylation, and block JNK activation.

Dynamin encodes five domains (Figure S2A available online): a catalytic G domain; a middle domain involved in self-assembly and oligomerization; a membrane-binding pleckstrin homology (PH) domain; a GTPase effector domain (GED); and a C-terminal proline- and arginine-rich domain (PRD) that binds SH3 domains of accessory proteins important for CME (Praefcke and McMahon, 2004Praefcke G.J.

Crystallographic and biochemical studies have shown that the CGED forms a three-helix bundle with the N and C termini of the G domain (NGTPase and CGTPase, respectively) (Figure S2B) and that this module—the bundle-signaling element (BSE)—transmits the conformational changes associated with dynamin assembly to the G domain (Chappie et al., 2009Chappie J.S.

However, as the BSE was structurally characterized in the context of the GG fusion, it is not known whether CGED's interaction with the G domain occurs in cis within the same polypeptide or in trans via another polypeptide in the dynamin tetramer. Dynamin has a low affinity for guanine nucleotides (10–100 μM) and a high basal turnover (∼0.4–1 min−1) (Praefcke and McMahon, 2004Praefcke G.J. McMahon H.T. The dynamin superfamily: universal membrane tubulation and fission molecules?.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 5: 133-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (1121) Google Scholar).

Nucleotide-dependent conformational changes in dynamin: evidence for a mechanochemical molecular spring.Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 27-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). This enhancement arises from G domain dimerization, which optimally positions dynamin's catalytic machinery and stabilizes conformationally flexible switch regions (Chappie et al., 2010Chappie J.S.

Mutations that impair GTP binding, assembly, or stimulated GTP hydrolysis also cause defects in endocytic uptake in vivo (reviewed in Schmid and Frolov, 2011Schmid S.L. Frolov V.A.

Despite its essential role in CME, the mechanism of dynamin-catalyzed membrane fission remains poorly understood. Efforts to recapitulate these activities in vitro using synthetic membranes suggested that dynamin functions as a mechanochemical enzyme that actively severs the membrane via hydrolysis-dependent conformational changes (Sweitzer and Hinshaw, 1998Sweitzer S.M.

The hydrolysis-dependent conformational changes that trigger these membrane-remodeling events have yet to be elucidated. Unraveling the mechanisms governing dynamin-catalyzed membrane fission requires a detailed structural understanding of the architecture of assembled dynamin and the conformational changes induced by stimulated GTP hydrolysis. Dynamin's propensity to form helical arrays in vitro has previously been exploited for cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure determination. Three-dimensional reconstructions of truncated dynamin 1 (ΔPRD, Figure S2A) polymers assembled on anionic lipid scaffolds have been obtained both in the absence of nucleotides (Chen et al., 2004Chen Y.J. Zhang P. Egelman E.H. Hinshaw J.E. The stalk region of dynamin drives the constriction of dynamin tubes.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 574-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) and in the presence of the nonhydrolyzable GTP analog GMPPCP (Zhang and Hinshaw, 2001Zhang P. Hinshaw J.E. Three-dimensional reconstruction of dynamin in the constricted state.Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 922-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). In both cases, the asymmetric unit of assembly is a dimer that adopts a T shape when viewed in cross-section (“T view”). The structural differences between these maps suggest that rearrangements in the middle domain and GED mediate a nucleotide-dependent constriction of the ΔPRD assembly (Chen et al., 2004Chen Y.J. Zhang P. Egelman E.H. Hinshaw J.E. The stalk region of dynamin drives the constriction of dynamin tubes.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 574-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Constriction alone, however, is not sufficient for membrane fission (Ramachandran and Schmid, 2008Ramachandran R. Schmid S.L. Real-time detection reveals that effectors couple dynamin's GTP-dependent conformational changes to the membrane.EMBO J. 2008; 27: 27-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, Bashkirov et al., 2008Bashkirov P.V.

GTPase cycle of dynamin is coupled to membrane squeeze and release, leading to spontaneous fission.Cell. 2008; 135: 1276-1286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar), suggesting that additional conformational changes are required. Although it has been inferred that the middle domain and GED form a coiled-coil “stalk” that connects the PH domain “leg” to the G domain “head” (Zhang and Hinshaw, 2001Zhang P. Hinshaw J.E. Three-dimensional reconstruction of dynamin in the constricted state.Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 922-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, Chen et al., 2004Chen Y.J. Zhang P. Egelman E.H. Hinshaw J.E. The stalk region of dynamin drives the constriction of dynamin tubes.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 574-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), neither the organization nor their connectivity in the polymer is known, owing to the low resolution (>20 Å) of the ΔPRD reconstructions and the lack of a complete, atomic-resolution dynamin structure. These limitations have also hindered our understanding of how assembly promotes G domain dimerization, leading to stimulated GTP hydrolysis and membrane fission. To address these issues, we have used cryo-EM to extend the resolution of the constricted ΔPRD polymer map and employed computational docking and biochemistry to define the underlying subunit interactions. We also present the crystal structure of GG in complex with GMPPCP, which identifies a major hydrolysis-dependent BSE conformational change. Our results provide insights into how dynamin assembly directly facilitates G domain dimerization and stimulated turnover and suggest how the energy of this dimerization and GTP hydrolysis can be converted into large structural movements that may play a role in precipitating membrane fission. Our initial attempt to characterize GMPPCP-bound, constricted ΔPRD tubes using cryo-EM and Fourier-Bessel synthesis produced an 18 Å resolution reconstruction (Wilson-Kubalek et al., 2010Wilson-Kubalek E.M. Chappie J.S. Arthur C.P. Helical crystallization of soluble and membrane binding proteins.Methods Enzymol. 2010; 481: 45-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) that displayed only minor differences compared to previously published structures (Zhang and Hinshaw, 2001Zhang P. Hinshaw J.E. Three-dimensional reconstruction of dynamin in the constricted state.Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 922-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, Chen et al., 2004Chen Y.J. Zhang P.

Helical crystallization of soluble and membrane binding proteins.Methods Enzymol. 2010; 481: 45-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The resolution was limited by variations in the tube diameter, which produced long-range disorder and diminished the overall diffracting power. To circumvent this, we segmented the tubes into individual, overlapping particles that were then aligned, classified, sorted, and averaged with the iterative helical real-space reconstruction (IHRSR) algorithm (Egelman, 2007Egelman E.H. The iterative helical real space reconstruction method: surmounting the problems posed by real polymers.J. Struct. Biol. 2007; 157: 83-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar) (Figure S1A–S1C). This single-particle-based approach produced a 12.2 Å helical map (Figure 1A ; Figure S1D ) that has an inner lumenal diameter of 7 nm, an outer diameter of 40 nm, 13.2 subunits per turn, and a pitch of 99.3 Å. The improved resolution reveals additional structural features of the ΔPRD polymer. First, the stalk density, which constitutes the base of the characteristic “T view” (Figure 1B; Movie S1), appears to twist in a crisscross fashion (Figures 1B and 1C), intersecting just below the cleft that separates the “head” density regions along the exterior of the polymer. Second, there are two additional strips of density within the cleft that wrap around the tube (Figure 1D, highlighted with dashed boxes). Each strip forms a continuous connection with the alternating head densities of a single helical rung.Figure S1Real-Space Image Processing and Comparison of Fitted Structures, Related to Figure 1 and the “Cryo-Electron Microscopy and Image Processing” and “Computational Docking” Sections of the Experimental ProceduresShow full caption(A) Images were classified and sorted based on tube diameter. 2D projections of the different class averages are shown.

Cell. 2009; 20: 3561-3571Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). To decipher the subunit organization of the dynamin polymer, we docked the crystal structures of the GDP.AlF4−-stabilized GG dimer (GGGDP.AlF4−; PDB 2X2E), the human MxA middle/GED stalk (PDB 3LJB), and the human dynamin 1 PH domain (PDB 1DYN) into our improved ΔPRD reconstruction (Figure 2A ). The MxA stalk structure shares a high degree of sequence homology (19.5% identical, 54.9% similar) with dynamin's middle domain and GED (Data S1) and currently represents the best structural model for these domains. Attempts to dock GGGDP.AlF4− as a dimer failed as one monomer always grossly protruded from the density, regardless of its orientation (Figure S3A ). The GGGDP.AlF4− dimer from an alternate crystal form (PDB 2X2F) exhibited the same discrepancies (data not shown). We therefore selected only one monomer for docking (monomer A from PDB 2X2E), which allowed more degrees of freedom during the fitting procedures. We similarly positioned the MxA stalks individually, as the crystallized assembly could only be fit into a previously published 23 Å ΔPRD map after a significant rotation between adjacent pairs of monomers (Gao et al., 2010Gao S. von der Malsburg A. Paeschke S. Behlke J. Haller O. Kochs G. Daumke O. Structural basis of oligomerization in the stalk region of dynamin-like MxA.Nature. 2010; 465: 502-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Fitting was carried out using YUP (Tan et al., 2006Tan R.K.-Z. Petrov A.S. Harvey S.C. YUP: A molecular simulation program for coarse-grained and multi-scale models.J. Chem.

In total, 8 GG monomers, 12 MxA monomers, and 8 PH domains were positioned into the cryo-EM density. In agreement with previous biochemical data and structural modeling (Chen et al., 2004Chen Y.J. Zhang P. Egelman E.H. Hinshaw J.E. The stalk region of dynamin drives the constriction of dynamin tubes.Nat. Struct. Mol.

It should be noted that, in our model, the density in the T view cross-section represents the interaction of four different MxA stalk monomers (Figure S3B).Figure S3G Domain, Stalk, and PH Interactions in the ΔPRD Assembly, Related to Figure 2Show full caption(A) GGGDP.AlF4− dimer does not fit into cryo-EM density. The long axis GGGDP.AlF4− dimer (PDB 2X2E) was docked into the 12.2 Å GMPPCP-stabilized ΔPRD cryo-EM reconstruction (gray). While one monomer (A) fits equally well in two possible orientations (green or red), the second monomer (B) grossly protrudes from the density. T view cross-sections of each dimer fitting are shown (same orientation as Figure 1C). Fitting of the B monomer or either monomer of the short axis GGGDP.AlF4− dimer (PDB 2X2F) yielded the same result (data not shown).(B) Four MxA monomers occupy the central T view density. Because the asymmetric unit of the ΔPRD helical tube is a dimer, it was proposed that two dynamin monomers interact in a crisscross fashion within ‘T-view’ density (Zhang and Hinshaw, 2001Zhang P. Hinshaw J.E. Three-dimensional reconstruction of dynamin in the constricted state.Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 922-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar).

Its regulation in ovarian cancer (OC) remains unexplored. Here, we show that transforming growth factor (TGF)-β, a cytokine involved in tumor dissemination is abundantly secreted in the OC microenvironment and induces TG2 expression and enzymatic activity. This is mediated at transcriptional level by SMADs and by TGF-β-activated kinase 1-mediated activation of the nuclear factor-κB complex. TGF-β-stimulated OC cells aggregate as spheroids, which enable peritoneal dissemination. We show that TGF-β-induced TG2 regulates EMT, formation of spheroids and OC metastasis. TG2 knock-down in OC cells decreases the number of cells harboring a cancer stem cell phenotype (CD44+/CD117+). Furthermore, CD44+/CD117+ cells isolated from human ovarian tumors express high levels of TG2. In summary, TGF-β-induced TG2 enhances ovarian tumor metastasis by inducing EMT and a cancer stem cell phenotype."
https://openalex.org/W2023012416,"Many replication initiators form higher-order oligomers that process host replication origins to promote replisome formation. In addition to dedicated duplex-DNA-binding domains, cellular initiators possess AAA+ (ATPases associated with various cellular activities) elements that drive functions ranging from protein assembly to origin recognition. In bacteria, the AAA+ domain of the initiator DnaA has been proposed to assist in single-stranded DNA formation during origin melting. Here we show crystallographically and in solution that the ATP-dependent assembly of Aquifex aeolicus DnaA into a spiral oligomer creates a continuous surface that allows successive AAA+ domains to bind and extend single-stranded DNA segments. The mechanism of binding is unexpectedly similar to that of RecA, a homologous recombination factor, but it differs in that DnaA promotes a nucleic acid conformation that prevents pairing of a complementary strand. These findings, combined with strand-displacement assays, indicate that DnaA opens replication origins by a direct ATP-dependent stretching mechanism. Comparative studies reveal notable commonalities between the approach used by DnaA to engage DNA substrates and other, nucleic-acid-dependent, AAA+ systems. DNA replication initiates locations known as origins. One feature of bacterial origins is an AT-rich sequence known as a DNA unwinding element (DUE) that is melted to allow assembly of the replisome. DnaA is an AAA+ ATPase involved in the initiation of replication. Although it was thought that the energy of ATP hydrolysis was used to disrupt base pairing of the DUE, Berger and colleagues now show that the ATPase activity of DnaA helps it to assemble as a spiral filament that opens and extends single-stranded DNA. Although this extension of DNA by a filament is surprisingly similar to the early steps in homologous pairing by RecA protein, the DNA stretched by DnaA is inaccessible to base pairing with a complementary strand."
https://openalex.org/W1985178687,"The transcriptional activators Oct4, Sox2, and Nanog cooperate with a wide array of cofactors to orchestrate an embryonic stem (ES) cell-specific gene expression program that forms the molecular basis of pluripotency. Here, we report using an unbiased in vitro transcription-biochemical complementation assay to discover a multisubunit stem cell coactivator complex (SCC) that is selectively required for the synergistic activation of the Nanog gene by Oct4 and Sox2. Purification, identification, and reconstitution of SCC revealed this coactivator to be the trimeric XPC-nucleotide excision repair complex. SCC interacts directly with Oct4 and Sox2 and is recruited to the Nanog and Oct4 promoters as well as a majority of genomic regions that are occupied by Oct4 and Sox2. Depletion of SCC/XPC compromised both pluripotency in ES cells and somatic cell reprogramming of fibroblasts to induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells. This study identifies a transcriptional coactivator with diversified functions in maintaining ES cell pluripotency and safeguarding genome integrity."

The next challenge will be to leverage this information to uncover basic mechanisms of disease and develop new therapies. To understand how this transformation is already beginning to unfold, we focus on the ciliopathies, a class of multi-organ diseases caused by disruption of the primary cilium.

Sitting at the interface between simple and complex genetic conditions, these diseases provide clues to the future direction of human genetics. Soon, the genetic basis of most human Mendelian diseases will be solved. The next challenge will be to leverage this information to uncover basic mechanisms of disease and develop new therapies. To understand how this transformation is already beginning to unfold, we focus on the ciliopathies, a class of multi-organ diseases caused by disruption of the primary cilium. Through a convergence of data involving mutant gene discovery, proteomics, and cell biology, more than a dozen phenotypically distinguishable conditions are now united as ciliopathies. Sitting at the interface between simple and complex genetic conditions, these diseases provide clues to the future direction of human genetics. Until a few years ago, identifying the genetic basis of an inherited human disease was an arduous undertaking, requiring potentially a decade or more of work in ascertainment of families for linkage analysis, followed by endless fine mapping of the locus and, finally, sequencing of candidate genes one by one until that “eureka” moment when the likely causative gene was identified. The newly discovered disease gene was often entirely novel, without recognizable domains or a path to understand the disease mechanism. A mouse model was then generated, in which the disease gene was inactivated. The mouse faithfully recapitulated the human phenotype in some cases but, more often, showed no phenotype or phenotypes not clearly related to the human disease. Once established, the model was studied from multiple perspectives to understand the cell biological and biochemical basis of disease, culminating in attempts to test potential therapies. Although successful in a few instances such as losartan treatment for Marfan syndrome (Habashi et al., 2006Habashi J.P. Judge D.P. Holm T.M. Cohn R.D. Loeys B.L. Cooper T.K. Myers L. Klein E.C. Liu G. Calvi C. et al.Losartan, an AT1 antagonist, prevents aortic aneurysm in a mouse model of Marfan syndrome.Science. 2006; 312: 117-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (1274) Google Scholar), this path has not fulfilled the promises of genomic medicine. This strategy has begun to change over the past 10 years due to increased knowledge of human genetic diseases, annotation of the human genome, and an amazing suite of tools to explore disease mechanisms. It is not uncommon now to open up a journal to find that geneticists have solved the molecular basis of a dozen or more conditions. And since we now know a lot more about the function of genes, protein domains, and networks, frequently just the discovery of the molecular cause of a disease can partially explain its mechanism. For instance, the discovery that the Rett syndrome gene encodes a methyl-CpG-binding protein (Amir et al., 1999Amir R.E. Van den Veyver I.B. Wan M. Tran C.Q. Francke U. Zoghbi H.Y. Rett syndrome is caused by mutations in X-linked MECP2, encoding methyl-CpG-binding protein 2.Nat. Genet. 1999; 23: 185-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (3519) Google Scholar) immediately set the stage for a host of important discoveries in epigenetics related to brain function. The types of mutations displayed by patients, known as allelic diversity (Figure 1), can tell us something about the effect of these disease-causing variants on protein function. By identifying patients with different phenotypes due to specific types of mutations in the same gene (i.e., genocopies), we can understand human disease as a network of related signs and symptoms. For example, specific types of mutations in the gene encoding p53 predispose to very different types of cancers. By comparing the genes mutated in phenotypically related human diseases, we can learn about the disturbed protein networks that underlie them. Finally, by exploring gene-gene and gene-environment interactions, we can begin to characterize genetic and epigenetic modifiers of disease. Perhaps the best example is age-related macular degeneration, in which a substantial part of the risk of disease can be quantified based on gene-environment interactions (Chen et al., 2010Chen Y. Bedell M. Zhang K. Age-related macular degeneration: genetic and environmental factors of disease.Mol. Interv. 2010; 10: 271-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Although they are individually rare conditions, the ciliopathies have emerged as a dynamic new field of biology that exemplifies how genetics can be employed to drive research in basic cell biology and vice versa. The primary cilium is structured with a basal body at its base and a 9-paired microtubule axoneme, surrounded by plasma membrane but lacking the central pair of microtubules and outer dynein arms that define its cousin, the motile cilium. Primary cilia were first observed more than a century ago and were initially thought to be evolutionary remnants. How is it that biologists missed their importance for so long? More than a dozen disorders are now considered to be within the ciliopathy spectrum, including Joubert syndrome (JBTS), nephronophthisis (NPHP), Senior-Loken syndrome (SLS), orofaciodigital (OFD), Jeune syndrome, autosomal dominant and recessive polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD and ARPKD), Leber congenital amaurosis (LCA), Meckel-Gruber syndrome (MKS), Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS), Usher syndrome (US), and some forms of retinal dystrophy (RD). Between them, these conditions involve nearly every major body organ, including kidney, brain, limb, retina, liver, and bone (Figure 2A ), highlighting the important role of the primary cilium in development and homeostasis. These conditions were largely defined by clinical geneticists in the middle of the last century, who did their best to ascribe syndromes to unique combinations of clinical features. Individual diseases are known for the most commonly involved or diseased organ: BBS patients display the triad of obesity, polydactyly, and retinopathy but can display a host of other pathologies. MKS is a lethal condition at birth, with occipital encephalocele, PKD, and polydactyly. JBTS is characterized by a very peculiar radiographic finding known as the “molar tooth sign,” characterized by elongated superior cerebellar peduncles, deepened interpeduncular fossa, and cerebellar vermis hypoplasia. For each of these conditions, significant phenotypic variability has been observed even between members of the same family, making clinical diagnosis a challenge. Now that these conditions have been united by their underlying cell biology, we can begin to see commonalities between individual syndromes (Figure 2A). For instance, low muscle tone, cystic kidney disease, agenesis of the brain's corpus callosum, mental retardation, and hyperpnea/apnea are additional clinical features often present in ciliopathy patients. Individuals affected by BBS can have several clinical features common to JBTS such as mental retardation, hypotonia, and apnea. However, they also share other symptoms that are usually not present in JBTS but are common to other ciliopathies, such as polydactyly and retinal dystrophy (RD). Moreover, BBS patients are usually obese, a unique trait that is absent among the other ciliopathies. The first few genes identified from positional cloning of human or mouse phenotypes for what would eventually become the ciliopathies initially did not point in an obvious way to the cilium as the site of action. It was not until evidence began to accumulate that the encoded proteins localize specifically near the cilium that the field was born (Ansley et al., 2003Ansley S.J. Badano J.L. Blacque O.E. Hill J. Hoskins B.E. Leitch C.C. Kim J.C. Ross A.J. Eichers E.R.

Polaris, a protein involved in left-right axis patterning, localizes to basal bodies and cilia.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 589-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Although the localization data is now incontrovertible, the functions of the encoded proteins at the cilium for the most part still remain a mystery, and some of the effects of these proteins do not seem to have direct relevance to ciliary function (Yen et al., 2006Yen H.J. Tayeh M.K. Mullins R.F. Stone E.M. Sheffield V.C. Slusarski D.C. Bardet-Biedl syndrome genes are important in retrograde intracellular trafficking and Kupffer's vesicle cilia function.Hum. Mol. Genet. 2006; 15: 667-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The question that emerges is how a single subcellular organelle can mediate such diverse clinical features. About 50 genes encoding predominantly ciliary-localized proteins have now been identified that are mutated in these partially overlapping syndromes (Figure 2B). In a series of positional cloning studies, each of these ciliopathy genes was initially found as causative for a restricted phenotype. Surprisingly, in most instances, this gene identification was followed by reports of mutations in the same gene in a different ciliopathy category (Baala et al., 2007aBaala L. Audollent S. Martinovic J. Ozilou C. Babron M.C. Sivanandamoorthy S. Saunier S. Salomon R. Gonzales M. Rattenberry E. et al.Pleiotropic effects of CEP290 (NPHP6) mutations extend to Meckel syndrome.Am. J. Hum.

Genet. 2006; 79: 556-561Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). This occurred with such regularity that the field began to wonder whether any genotype-phenotype correlations would stand the test of time. How could mutations in a single gene produce such pleiotropic phenotypic effects in patients? Were these observations exceptions to the rule of strict genotype-phenotype correlation, or were they the exception that proves the rule of widespread phenotypic pleiotropy? The primary cilium is a hair-like, immotile cellular organelle protruding from almost all eukaryotic cells, frequently described as the cell's “antenna” for transducing extracellular signals. For the purposes of this Review, we focus exclusively on diseases involving nonmotile cilia and do not include diseases like primary cilia dyskinesia that involve motile cilia, as there is little phenotypic or genetic overlap. Cilia are generated during interphase from the mother centriole by coalescence of vesicles at its distal end that fuse with the plasma membrane. After this docking of the mother centriole, the microtubule axoneme protrudes out of the cell, concurrent with recruitment of a host of ciliary-specific proteins. The basal body (i.e., the docked mother centriole) possesses several specialized accessory structures termed transition fibers, basal feet, and ciliary rootlets and is surrounded by the pericentriolar matrix. But for many years, the molecular determinants of these structures were unknown. Recent work has begun to hint at the molecular architecture of these anatomically defined structures. The 9+0 microtubule arrangement of the axoneme emerges from the basal body in a triplet configuration and shifts to a doublet configuration at the ciliary transition zone (TZ). The Y-shaped microtubule extensions that define the TZ require the Cep290 protein for their formation in Chlamydamonas (Craige et al., 2010Craige B. Tsao C.C. Diener D.R. Hou Y. Lechtreck K.F. Rosenbaum J.L. Witman G.B. CEP290 tethers flagellar transition zone microtubules to the membrane and regulates flagellar protein content.J. Cell Biol. 2010; 190: 927-940Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar), although it is not clear whether Cep290 constitutes or otherwise contributes to these structures or whether this function is conserved in vertebrates. The location of the TZ marks the ciliary diffusion barrier: a septin-2 cytoskeleton that separates the ciliary and cytoplasmic compartments (Hu et al., 2010Hu Q. Milenkovic L. Jin H. Scott M.P. Nachury M.V. Spiliotis E.T. Nelson W.J. A septin diffusion barrier at the base of the primary cilium maintains ciliary membrane protein distribution.Science. 2010; 329: 436-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). Attention has shifted to the TZ as the site of action of proteins mutated in several ciliopathies (Garcia-Gonzalo et al., 2011Garcia-Gonzalo F.R. Corbit K.C. Sirerol-Piquer M.S. Ramaswami G. Otto E.A. Noriega T.R. Seol A.D. Robinson J.F. Bennett C.L. Josifova D.J. et al.A transition zone complex regulates mammalian ciliogenesis and ciliary membrane composition.Nat. Genet. 2011; 43: 776-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar), but clear structure-function relationships are still lacking. Protein synthesis and vesicular transport do not occur inside cilia, so the assembly of this organelle, its maintenance, and its function are totally dependent upon an intraflagellar transport system by which proteins track bidirectionally along the polarized microtubules of the axoneme (Kozminski et al., 1993Kozminski K.G. Johnson K.A. Forscher P. Rosenbaum J.L. A motility in the eukaryotic flagellum unrelated to flagellar beating.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1993; 90: 5519-5523Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar). Although the involvement of primary cilia in human diseases is now well established, many questions about its function remain. The current paradigm describes the primary cilium as an organelle for detecting and modulating the response to extracellular signaling molecules and as a location for organizing their cytoplasmic effectors. It is well poised to mediate both effects, as cilia typically protrude in a polarized fashion, which can help the cell interpret the context of extracellular signals. Many cellular receptors are localized to the primary cilium, and the basal body is itself a signaling hub, probably serving as an efficient transit point to transmit signals into the nucleus. In fact, a number of transcription factors undergo processing within or near the cilium prior to nuclear entry. Numerous critical developmental signaling pathways have been directly linked to primary cilia, such as Hedgehog (Hh), canonical and noncanonical Wnt, and some forms of PDGF signaling, highlighting cilia's role as a signaling hub (Huangfu et al., 2003Huangfu D. Liu A. Rakeman A.S. Murcia N.S. Niswander L. Anderson K.V.

Genet. 2005; 37: 537-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar). In addition to the modulation of these signaling pathways, primary cilia are essential for mechanical, odor, and photo reception. The interpretation of the ciliopathies as a unique group of disorders associated with defects in a single organelle gave a new direction to the investigation of these human diseases. The marriage of proteomics with genomics in the area of ciliary biology can be traced to an influential paper showing that the RFX-type transcription factor DAF-19 is essential for assembly of cilia in C. elegans sensory neurons and regulates several genes encoding intraflagellar transport proteins (Swoboda et al., 2000Swoboda P. Adler H.T. Thomas J.H. The RFX-type transcription factor DAF-19 regulates sensory neuron cilium formation in C. elegans.Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 411-421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). The RFX transcription factor family emerged in ciliated proto-eukaryotes, but it was only later that the RFX genes were co-opted to regulate expression of cilia-specific genes based upon the presence of an X box in their promoter (Piasecki et al., 2010Piasecki B.P. Burghoorn J. Swoboda P. Regulatory Factor X (RFX)-mediated transcriptional rewiring of ciliary genes in animals.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2010; 107: 12969-12974Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). This work set the stage for a comparative genomics approach to search for X-box-containing genes that were likely to encode proteins relevant to primary cilia. Two follow-up studies demonstrated the potential of this approach in identifying important components of the primary cilium (Avidor-Reiss et al., 2004Avidor-Reiss T. Maer A.M. Koundakjian E.

The ciliome (Gherman et al., 2006Gherman A. Davis E.E. Katsanis N. The ciliary proteome database: an integrated community resource for the genetic and functional dissection of cilia.Nat.

The ciliary proteome has already proved to be a powerful resource, accelerating the identification of candidate human ciliopathy genes by short-listing positional candidates. For example, the cloning of MKS1, BBS3, BBS5, and the BBS modifier MGC1203 was achieved by sequencing a reduced set of candidate genes (Badano et al., 2006Badano J.L. Leitch C.C. Ansley S.J.

An important observation, which has stood the test of time, is that the composition of these specific protein modules could have been predicted based upon the phenotype observed in patients. Specifically, the proteins from seven of the eight most conserved genes mutated in BBS form a core complex termed the BBSome (Nachury et al., 2007Nachury M.V. Loktev A.V. Zhang Q. Westlake C.J. Peränen J. Merdes A. Slusarski D.C. Scheller R.H. Bazan J.F. Sheffield V.C. Jackson P.K.

Importantly, this complex does not contain proteins encoded by other ciliopathy diseases genes such as NPHP, JBTS, or MKS. This is perhaps surprising considering that mutations in MKS genes can cause BBS (Leitch et al., 2008Leitch C.C. Zaghloul N.A. Davis E.E. Stoetzel C. Diaz-Font A. Rix S. Alfadhel M. Lewis R.A.

Three separate complexes containing many of the proteins mutated in NPHP, JBTS, and MKS were recently identified, and although their function is still under investigation, genes for two of the copurifying proteins, ATXN10 and TCTN2, were found to be mutated in patients matching the same “module” phenotype (Sang et al., 2011Sang L.

Kwong M. et al.Mapping the NPHP-JBTS-MKS protein network reveals ciliopathy disease genes and pathways.Cell. 2011; 145: 513-528Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). In general, the complexes also display specificity in subcellular localization and function: the MKS/JBTS complex transduces hedgehog signaling and localizes to the ciliary transition zone, whereas the BBS complex forms a coat complex to target vesicles to the cilium and localizes to ciliary membrane (Jin et al., 2010Jin H. White S.R. Shida T. Schulz S. Aguiar M. Gygi S.P. Bazan J.F. Nachury M.V. The conserved Bardet-Biedl syndrome proteins assemble a coat that traffics membrane proteins to cilia.Cell. 2010; 141: 1208-1219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). Proteins have nonredundant function within a given module and do not associate or function in other modules. This work has been further corroborated by analyzing a series of C. elegans double mutants, which demonstrate worsened synthetic phenotypes (i.e., functional interactions) only when mutations occur in two different modules (Williams et al., 2011Williams C.L. Li C. Kida K. Inglis P.N. Mohan S. Semenec L. Bialas N.J. Stupay R.M. Chen N. Blacque O.E. et al.MKS and NPHP modules cooperate to establish basal body/transition zone membrane associations and ciliary gate function during ciliogenesis.J. Cell Biol. 2011; 192: 1023-1041Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar), but not with two different mutations in the same module. For instance, the B9 domain proteins of the MKS module functionally interact with the NPHP module (Williams et al., 2008Williams C.L. Winkelbauer M.E. Schafer J.C. Michaud E.J. Yoder B.K. Functional redundancy of the B9 proteins and nephrocystins in Caenorhabditis elegans ciliogenesis.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2008; 19: 2154-2168Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), but not with most other genes in the MKS module. The conclusion is that each module probably mediates partially separate ciliary functions. Inactivating one component in a module is probably sufficient to fully inactivate the module, so functional interaction is only observed by inactivating a component in a different module. Taken together, these examples show that the availability of various disease proteomes in combination with the explosion of currently available genomic and transcriptomic data sets are driving forward biological network analysis in human disease (Figure 3). What can the study of the ciliopathies teach us about the future direction of human genetic disease? Most obviously, that human genetics will be a lot more complex than many of us would have predicted. One obvious example is in the degree of multiple allelism at particular genetic loci. Although some of the ciliopathy genes are associated with only a single phenotypic class to date, other gene mutations can result in phenotypes along the entire ciliopathy clinical spectrum. For instance, mutations in CEP290 are reported in MKS, JBTS, NPHP, BBS, and LCA, spanning the full breadth of severity (Coppieters et al., 2010bCoppieters F. Lefever S. Leroy B.P. De Baere E. CEP290, a gene with many faces: mutation overview and presentation of CEP290base.Hum. Mutat. 2010; 31: 1097-1108Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar), whereas ARL13B mutations are restricted to patients with JBTS. For ARL13B, it is not clear whether this gene is only capable of causing a restricted phenotype or whether there are additional mutations to be identified in other ciliopathy class disorders. Current data would suggest the latter, as only hypomorphic mutations in ARL13B gene were identified in humans, whereas comparably more severe phenotypes were observed in mouse and zebrafish (Caspary et al., 2007Caspary T.

https://openalex.org/W2029816065,"Protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) plays important roles in downregulation of insulin and leptin signaling and is an established therapeutic target for diabetes and obesity. PTP1B is regulated by reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced in response to various stimuli, including insulin. The reversibly oxidized form of the enzyme (PTP1B-OX) is inactive and undergoes profound conformational changes at the active site. We generated conformation-sensor antibodies, in the form of single-chain variable fragments (scFvs), that stabilize PTP1B-OX and thereby inhibit its phosphatase function. Expression of conformation-sensor scFvs as intracellular antibodies (intrabodies) enhanced insulin-induced tyrosyl phosphorylation of the β subunit of the insulin receptor and its substrate IRS-1 and increased insulin-induced phosphorylation of PKB/AKT. Our data suggest that stabilization of the oxidized, inactive form of PTP1B with appropriate therapeutic molecules may offer a paradigm for phosphatase drug development."
https://openalex.org/W2141339467,"High-grade gliomas (World Health Organization grade III anaplastic astrocytoma and grade IV glioblastoma multiforme), the most prevalent primary malignant brain tumors, display a cellular hierarchy with self-renewing, tumorigenic cancer stem cells (CSCs) at the apex. While the CSC hypothesis has been an attractive model to describe many aspects of tumor behavior, it remains controversial due to unresolved issues including the use of ex vivo analyses with differential growth conditions. A CSC population has been confirmed in malignant gliomas by preferential tumor formation from cells directly isolated from patient biopsy specimens. However, direct comparison of multiple tumor cell populations with analysis of the resulting phenotypes of each population within a representative tumor environment has not been clearly described. To directly test the relative tumorigenic potential of CSCs and non-stem tumor cells in the same microenvironment, we interrogated matched tumor populations purified from a primary human tumor transplanted into a xenograft mouse model and monitored competitive in vivo tumor growth studies using serial in vivo intravital microscopy. While CSCs were a small minority of the initial transplanted cancer cell population, the CSCs, not the non-stem tumor cells, drove tumor formation and yielded tumors displaying a cellular hierarchy. In the resulting tumors, a fraction of the initial transplanted CSCs maintained expression of stem cell and proliferation markers, which were significantly higher compared to the non-stem tumor cell population and demonstrated that CSCs generated cellular heterogeneity within the tumor. These head-to-head comparisons between matched CSCs and non-stem tumor cells provide the first functional evidence using live imaging that in the same microenvironment, CSCs more than non-stem tumor cells are responsible for tumor propagation, confirming the functional definition of a CSC."

https://openalex.org/W2034700718,"The extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK1 and 2) are widely-expressed and they modulate proliferation, survival, differentiation, and protein synthesis in multiple cell lineages. Altered ERK1/2 signaling is found in several genetic diseases with skeletal phenotypes, including Noonan syndrome, Neurofibromatosis type 1, and Cardio-facio-cutaneous syndrome, suggesting that MEK-ERK signals regulate human skeletal development. Here, we examine the consequence of Erk1 and Erk2 disruption in multiple functions of osteoclasts, specialized macrophage/monocyte lineage-derived cells that resorb bone. We demonstrate that Erk1 positively regulates osteoclast development and bone resorptive activity, as genetic disruption of Erk1 reduced osteoclast progenitor cell numbers, compromised pit formation, and diminished M-CSF-mediated adhesion and migration. Moreover, WT mice reconstituted long-term with Erk1−/− bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMMNCs) demonstrated increased bone mineral density as compared to recipients transplanted with WT and Erk2−/− BMMNCs, implicating marrow autonomous, Erk1-dependent osteoclast function. These data demonstrate Erk1 plays an important role in osteoclast functions while providing rationale for the development of Erk1-specific inhibitors for experimental investigation and/or therapeutic modulation of aberrant osteoclast function."

Key research thrusts in both academia and industry will speed this transition, and lessons learned for cancer will shape the process for genetic contributions to the therapy of disease more broadly. In the era of next-generation sequencing, there are significant challenges to harnessing cancer genome information to develop novel therapies. Key research thrusts in both academia and industry will speed this transition, and lessons learned for cancer will shape the process for genetic contributions to the therapy of disease more broadly. Breakthrough advances in the treatment of medical illness require the elucidation of the pathogenic mechanisms initiating and driving disease states. Cancer is largely a disease of the genome, and through recent technological advances, we are now able to separate the “diseased” cancer genome from the normal genome. As a consequence, the next decade should see dissection of disease-relevant somatic mutations and the completion of the “pathogenetic” landscape of cancer, paving the way for further therapeutic development. The discovery of key pathogenetic cancer alterations has already transformed the treatment of specific cancer types. The introduction of all-trans retinoic acid to the treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia harboring translocations into the RARα gene has led to curative responses in the majority of patients (Huang et al., 1988Huang M.E. Ye Y.C. Chen S.R. Chai J.R. Lu J.X. Zhoa L. Gu L.J. Wang Z.Y. Blood. 1988; 72: 567-572Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Treatment of chronic myelogenous leukemia, bearing the BCR-ABL fusion gene, with imatinib, an inhibitor of the Abelson kinase, has led to a staggering ∼80% decline in disease mortality (Figure 1). More recently, inhibitors targeting EGFR mutations in adenocarcinoma of the lung, BRAF mutations in melanoma, and ALK translocations in lung cancer highlight the potential to alter the course of previously untreatable disease (reviewed in Haber et al., 2011Haber D.A. Gray N.S. Baselga J. Cell. 2011; 145: 19-24Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). These encouraging results strongly suggest that the next step toward the goal of curing cancer is to more fully exploit this genetic-therapeutic strategy. Though access to ever-increasing amounts of sequence information holds great promise, there are at least five significant barriers to this goal. First, we do not yet have a complete picture of the genetic alterations comprising the disordered cancer genome. Second, the discovery of specific mutations that lead to cancer, so called “driver” mutations, is too often accompanied by an inability to create a relevant therapeutic molecule. In other words, there is a “druggability gap.” Third, most cancers, particularly those that are late stage, are genetically heterogeneous or capable of rapid genetic evolution. Either scenario can lead to the rapid emergence of therapeutic resistance. Fourth, as a corollary to the problem of resistance, combination therapy will be required to achieve therapeutic cure or long-lasting disease control. Finally, the ability to make more definitive predictions about clinical therapeutic outcome is severely limited by the lack of robust preclinical disease models. The daunting complexity of the human cancer genome is amply illustrated by the emerging fully characterized cancer genomes. For example, a recent study looking at prostate cancer identified substantial variation between the patient tumors (Figure 2) (Berger et al., 2011Berger M.F. Lawrence M.S. Demichelis F. Drier Y. Cibulskis K. Sivachenko A.Y. Sboner A. Esgueva R. Pflueger D. Sougnez C. et al.Nature. 2011; 470: 214-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (910) Google Scholar). This complexity appears both as the diversity of genetic alterations across many cancer types and samples and the complexity within single tumors, in which the background mutation frequency (“carrier” mutations) often exceeds the frequency of “driver” mutations. Thus, in order to distinguish the critical genetic alterations of therapeutic interest, repetitive mutations or repetitively mutated genes across many samples from individual tumor types must be identified and correlated with disease in a relevant manner. One can envision a broader goal requiring larger sample sets whereby we would define not only the cancer gene alterations, but also the cancer gene interactions. As examples, early efforts to describe the glioblastoma genome identified three core interacting genetic pathways in this disease (The Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2008Cancer Genome Atlas Research NetworkNature. 2008; 455: 1061-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (5211) Google Scholar), whereas low-frequency single-gene mutations appear to, in aggregate, target the NFKB pathway in myeloma (Chapman et al., 2011Chapman M.A. Lawrence M.S. Keats J.J. Cibulskis K. Sougnez C. Schinzel A.C. Harview C.L. Brunet J.P. Ahmann G.J. Adli M. et al.Nature. 2011; 471: 467-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (1049) Google Scholar). Therefore, the vision of “completeness” is to characterize cancer genomes at a sufficient scale so that genetic interactions can be used to directly define the key functional cancer pathways and potentially the therapeutic targets. To this end, the goal should be to describe three interaction attributes beyond single-gene mutation frequency, specifically: (1) to identify those genetic alterations that co-occur at a greater frequency than by chance alone and are hence cooperative, (2) to identify those genes in which alterations anticorrelate and thus provide a similar function or where co-mutation is incompatible with cancer cell progression, and (3) to identify genes whose coding sequence is notable for the absence of background mutations. In this latter case, the absence of background loss-of-function mutations could potentially define genes whose function is absolutely required for cancer cell survival. This so-called class of “never-mutated” genes will likely be conditioned by driver genetic events and could be an important new class of “conditional lethality” genes particularly relevant to therapeutic development. Advances in sequencing technology have created the opportunity to achieve these goals; however, high-priority efforts must now be made to address the remaining rate-limiting steps of tumor sample acquisition, data handling, and data analysis. The identification of protein kinases, activated by somatic mutation, has led the recent wave of therapeutic breakthroughs outlined above. In sharp contrast is the realization that most of the known critical oncogenes and tumor suppressors remain beyond the reach of current therapeutic modalities. Sequencing projects have reaffirmed TP53 as the most commonly mutated tumor suppressor gene and the RAS oncogenes (K-RAS and N-RAS) as key drivers of a variety of devastating cancers. Yet, the elucidation of p53 and RAS biology has not been coupled with major revolutions in therapeutics based on these genetic alterations. Similarly, the discovery of key oncogenic transcription factors, including MYC, NMYC, ERG, and others, has not been paralleled by the development of transcription factor inhibitors. To address this druggabilty gap, it is first necessary that we challenge the notion of what is “undruggable” so that drug targets are not rejected outright based on prior assumptions (or past failures). Similar prejudices led to the premature conclusions that kinases and other ATP-utilizing enzymes were themselves undruggable. The development of drugs disrupting protein-protein interactions (PPI) between IAPs and SMAC (Sun et al., 2004Sun H. Nikolovska-Coleska Z. Yang C.Y. Xu L. Tomita Y. Krajewski K. Roller P.P. Wang S. J. Med. Chem. 2004; 47: 4147-4150Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), between p53 and HDM2 (Vassilev et al., 2004Vassilev L.T. Vu B.T. Graves B. Carvajal D. Podlaski F. Filipovic Z. Kong N. Kammlott U. Lukacs C. Klein C. et al.Science. 2004; 303: 844-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (3517) Google Scholar), and, most notably, along the remarkably extended interface between BH3-containing proteins and BCL2 family members belie the notion that such PPI targets are inherently intractable (Oltersdorf et al., 2005Oltersdorf T. Elmore S.W. Shoemaker A.R. Armstrong R.C. Augeri D.J. Belli B.A. Bruncko M. Deckwerth T.L. Dinges J. Hajduk P.J. et al.Nature. 2005; 435: 677-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (2735) Google Scholar). Further broadening of the scope of druggable targets can be achieved through a number of parallel mechanisms. In the arena of “typical” synthetic low-molecular weight molecules, we will benefit from increases in diversity and scale of available small-molecule libraries. In academia, renewed interest in direct participation in drug discovery has enabled establishment of modest-scale low-molecular weight screening facilities. Such efforts may focus on phenotype-oriented drug discovery, and hopefully breakthroughs against difficult targets will follow. But centers must be bolstered with robust medicinal chemistry resources, or it will become difficult to make advances beyond the relatively weak nonspecific inhibitors typically identified through screening. The most challenging drug discovery projects (e.g., PPIs) typically require structure-based guidance (X-ray and NMR) and an investment in biophysical analysis platforms. Indeed, in tackling challenging drug targets, it is likely that these resources will be of more value than the screening platforms themselves. In industry, time-dependent pressure to deliver molecules ready for clinical trials drives early-stage drug discovery efforts focused on tractable targets, including those with often tenuous links to disease pathogenesis over those focused on difficult targets with incontrovertible disease linkage. Perversely, this can reward a scenario of costly late-clinical failure based on the invalidation of the therapeutic hypothesis over a scenario of early-research failure based on druggability. Notably, the current biotechnology venture-based funding model suffers from the same short-term reward structure. Somehow, a proportion of the biopharmaceutical drug discovery resource must be dedicated over the longer term to the discovery of compounds that break new ground against the most challenging of targets. To expand these efforts on the small molecule front for particular targets, we need research funding mechanisms in academia or industry that are compatible with the 5–10 year timescale required for tackling difficult drug discovery problems. Alternative therapeutic modalities, including therapeutic siRNA, intracellular peptide therapies, and gene therapy, hold promise for a broad attack on the druggability gap but are all beset by a common issue: difficult drug delivery. The challenge to the delivery of therapeutic siRNA remains essentially unchanged from that faced by antisense oligonucleotides. The molecules are large (>10,000 MW) and highly charged, making distribution across biological membranes problematic (Shim and Kwon, 2010Shim M.S. Kwon Y.J. FEBS J. 2010; 277: 4814-4827Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). To realize the promises for these novel therapeutic classes, a renewed focus on systematic and robust approaches to the delivery problem is warranted. In the short-term, certain key cancer genes are likely to remain relatively difficult to drug. This is a notable problem for the tumor suppressor genes, in which the gene product is often completely absent. Here, the hope is to exploit the concept of “synthetic lethality” or “conditional lethality” in order to define key therapeutic targets whose requirement for the maintenance of the cancer state is conditioned by a specific genetic event (Kaelin, 2005Kaelin Jr., W.G. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2005; 5: 689-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (1011) Google Scholar). Such conditional lethality nodes can be conceived of as existing within a pathway downstream of an oncogene or tumor suppressor or in a parallel pathway. In the case of downstream conditional lethality, preclinical and clinical proof of concept has been obtained from the inhibition of the SMO receptor downstream of tumor suppressor mutations in the PTCH gene (Von Hoff et al., 2009Von Hoff D.D. LoRusso P.M. Rudin C.M. Reddy J.C. Yauch R.L. Tibes R. Weiss G.J. Borad M.J. Hann C.L. Brahmer J.R. et al.N. Engl. J. Med. 2009; 361: 1164-1172Crossref PubMed Scopus (893) Google Scholar), from the inhibition of mTORC1 downstream of germline mutations in the TSC genes (Krueger et al., 2010Krueger D.A. Care M.M. Holland K. Agricola K. Tudor C. Mangeshkar P. Wilson K.A. Byars A. Sahmoud T. Franz D.N. N. Engl. J. Med. 2010; 363: 1801-1811Crossref PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar), and from the inhibition of MEK downstream of mutant oncogenic BRAF in melanoma (Solit et al., 2006Solit D.B. Garraway L.A. Pratilas C.A. Sawai A. Getz G. Basso A. Ye Q. Lobo J.M. She Y. Osman I. et al.Nature. 2006; 439: 358-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (1094) Google Scholar). In the case of parallel pathway conditional lethality, clinical proof of concept has been obtained from the inhibition of PARP1 in the context of BRCA1 loss-of-function mutations in breast cancer (Farmer et al., 2005Farmer H. McCabe N. Lord C.J. Tutt A.N. Johnson D.A. Richardson T.B. Santarosa M. Dillon K.J. Hickson I. Knights C. et al.Nature. 2005; 434: 917-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (4055) Google Scholar, Fong et al., 2009Fong P.C. Boss D.S. Yap T.A. Tutt A. Wu P. Mergui-Roelvink M. Mortimer P. Swaisland H. Lau A. O'Connor M.J. et al.N. Engl. J. Med. 2009; 361: 123-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (2704) Google Scholar). In each case, the key finding is that mutant-bearing tumors are far more susceptible to the relevant inhibitor than either nonmutant tumors or the normal host tissue. The tools for further discovery of such conditional lethal nodes are only just becoming available with improvements in larger-scale shRNA libraries. However, the robust realization of such discoveries remains plagued by the noise inherent in larger-scale shRNA screens and, in some cases, the overreliance on screens in isogenic cell line pairs that can often lead to cell line-specific hits. In this regard, the alternative approach of cell line panels should be considered (Brough et al., 2011Brough R. Frankum J.R. Sims D. Mackay A. Mendes-Pereira A.M. Bajrami I. Costa-Cabral S. Rafiq R. Ahmad A.S. Cerone M.A. et al.Cancer Discov. 2011; 1: 260-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). An investment in the development of highly validated shRNAs for each human and murine gene could go a long way in helping to reduce the notion of conditional lethality to practical discovery. The evolutionary nature of cancer and its mutable genome makes emergent therapeutic resistance a serious and often unnerving problem. No doubt this is a major hurdle in moving from therapeutic efficacy to curative cancer therapy. Though there has been a notable lack of progress in defining clinically relevant mechanisms of resistance to classical cytotoxics, more rapid progress has been seen in understanding resistance to genetically directed targeted therapeutics. In particular, it is clear that, in the latter case, the preclinical discovery of resistance mechanisms can be directly predictive of the resistance features seen in patients. A first example was the elucidation of mechanisms of resistance to imatinib, in which the preclinical definition of resistance alleles through a random mutagenesis and selection process was, in retrospect, highly correlated with resistance alleles uncovered in patient samples (Azam et al., 2003Azam M. Latek R.R. Daley G.Q. Cell. 2003; 112: 831-843Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar, Shah et al., 2002Shah N.P. Nicoll J.M. Nagar B. Gorre M.E. Paquette R.L. Kuriyan J. Sawyers C.L. Cancer Cell. 2002; 2: 117-125Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1389) Google Scholar). Similarly, clinically relevant mechanisms of resistance to EGFR, SMO, and RAF inhibitors have been uncovered through a variety of preclinical studies employing the relevant addicted cell line or animal models. In parallel, the application of next-generation sequencing technologies to the discovery of very low-abundance pre-existing resistance alleles can allow confirmation of preclinical discoveries prior to treatment with relevant inhibitors. The utility of predictive preclinical resistance studies together with the advent of deep sequencing raise the possibility that resistance mechanisms could be identified before the clinical trials of novel therapeutics begin. In fact, ideally such an approach would be used to guide improvements in the first-generation inhibitors during lead optimization. For example, choices among distinct small-molecule scaffold classes with alternate binding modes to a target of interest could be prioritized based on the frequency and propensity of resistance mechanisms and upon which resistance alleles are detectable in patients prior to treatment. Presumably, this approach could accelerate the generation of best-in-class targeted therapeutics. The rapid emergence of resistance during targeted therapy has raised the specter of an endless chase of resistance alleles, with ever more specific inhibitors dealing with an increasing complex spectrum of resistance alleles and nongenetic tumor-adaptive responses. Though this so-called “whack-a-mole” approach can lead to the rapid clinical development of second-generation or third-generation inhibitors applied in mutation-specific settings, this will not be the ultimate strategy for achieving curative therapy. Rather, defining the emergent principles of resistance should be used to both (1) guide improvements to the first-line targeted therapeutics to gain-greater efficacy and (2) elucidate rationale combinations based on the understanding of escape mechanisms. What can we say about the principles of resistance to targeted therapeutics that are now evident from the study of ABL, EGFR, KIT, BRAF, and SMO inhibitors? The common theme is a fairly remarkable and consistent finding of persistent target and pathway addiction. Given the complexity of the cancer genome and the well-recognized mutability, one might have imagined that hundreds of distinct resistance mechanisms would have emerged in response to any given targeted therapy. Instead, the observation is that of a consistent pattern of resistance mechanisms, acting in large part to restore the activity of the original “addicting” pathway. In the case of imatinib-based treatment of CML, the great majority of resistance alleles are found in the ABL kinase domain itself. Based on these data, ABL inhibitors capable of both directly suppressing such mutations and more potently inhibiting the wild-type kinase have substantially improved the molecular response rates (Kantarjian et al., 2010Kantarjian H. Shah N.P. Hochhaus A. Cortes J. Shah S. Ayala M. Moiraghi B. Shen Z. Mayer J. Pasquini R. et al.N. Engl. J. Med. 2010; 362: 2260-2270Crossref PubMed Scopus (1184) Google Scholar, Saglio et al., 2010Saglio G. Kim D.W. Issaragrisil S. le Coutre P. Etienne G. Lobo C. Pasquini R. Clark R.E. Hochhaus A. Hughes T.P. et al.ENESTnd InvestigatorsN. Engl. J. Med. 2010; 362: 2251-2259Crossref PubMed Scopus (1264) Google Scholar). Lung adenocarcinomas bearing activating mutations in EGFR show dramatic response to catalytic EGFR inhibitors but relapse through direct mutations in the EGFR kinase domain or through coamplification of MET (Kobayashi et al., 2005Kobayashi S. Boggon T.J. Dayaram T. Jänne P.A. Kocher O. Meyerson M. Johnson B.E. Eck M.J. Tenen D.G. Halmos B. N. Engl. J.

PLoS Med. 2005; 2: e73Crossref PubMed Scopus (2901) Google Scholar). In both instances, a common feature is the restoration of downstream signaling through phosphoinositide-3 kinase. Based on these data, second-generation inhibitors, novel combinations with MET inhibitors and with PI3K inhibitors, are in development. Melanomas bearing activating mutations in BRAF similarly manifest significant responses to BRAF or MEK inhibitors, and through heterogeneous mechanisms, escape is manifest largely by reactivation of the MEK-ERK cascade. Finally, the study of resistance to the androgen receptor pathway inhibitors in prostate cancer for two decades has focused on so-called androgen-independent means of resistance. The recent clinical success of CYP17 inhibitors (Attard et al., 2008Attard G. Reid A.H. Yap T.A. Raynaud F. Dowsett M. Settatree S. Barrett M. Parker C. Martins V. Folkerd E. et al.J. Clin. Oncol. 2008; 26: 4563-4571Crossref PubMed Scopus (744) Google Scholar) and novel AR antagonists (Scher et al., 2010Scher H.I. Beer T.M. Higano C.S. Anand A. Taplin M.E. Efstathiou E. Rathkopf D.

Alumkal J. et al.Prostate Cancer Foundation/Department of Defense Prostate Cancer Clinical Trials ConsortiumLancet. 2010; 375: 1437-1446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (863) Google Scholar) has shown, however, that such “androgen-independent” tumors remain dependent on both AR and AR ligands. In all, the emerging data from these examples and others strongly support the notion that cancers remain highly dependent on these initial dominant oncogenic pathways and support the elaboration of improved inhibitors or of “vertical” pathway combinations, where inhibitors target the same pathway, as at least one mechanism by which we can improve the first-line treatment of cancer. Such combinations are also likely to be effective in the case of nongenetic or adaptive resistance mechanisms involving pharmacologic activation of homeostatic feedback loops exemplified by the finding of RTK activation induced by AKT inhibition (Chandarlapaty et al., 2011Chandarlapaty S. Sawai A. Scaltriti M. Rodrik-Outmezguine V. Grbovic-Huezo O. Serra V. Majumder P.K. Baselga J. Rosen N. Cancer Cell. 2011; 19: 58-71Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (711) Google Scholar). The majority of curative cancer treatment regimens involve multidrug combinations. The emergence of therapeutic resistance together with the frequent incomplete response to primary therapy underscores the importance of developing novel highly efficacious combinations. Here, we face substantial challenges in both the research arena and the clinic. The preclinical discovery of combination therapies is significantly limited by experimental throughput and by the lack of a consistent understanding of which measures of preclinical combination activity might be predictive of clinical combination activity. The throughput of combination profiling in vitro might be solved through automation; however, animal costs rapidly become prohibitive if systematic in vivo combination testing is required. Measures of combination effect, i.e., the interaction between two drugs to produce a cellular outcome, have become increasingly sophisticated, yet there is little understanding of how such improved methods will relate to the clinic. Efforts to solve this latter problem are urgently needed. The clinical challenge is to move beyond the paradigm that requires the testing of new agents in combination with existing standard of care therapies (SOCs). This incremental strategy ignores the possibilities that novel and existing agents might be antagonistic and that two novel agents might be more effective as a combination without an SOC component. Fortunately, recognition that this paradigm is inadequate has led to early phase II clinical trials in which two novel agents are being tested in combination prior to the full demonstration of single-agent activity. Notably, the observation that the treatment of RAS-driven tumors may require blockade of both the PI3K and RAS pathways (Engelman et al., 2008Engelman J.A. Chen L. Tan X. Crosby K. Guimaraes A.R. Upadhyay R. Maira M. McNamara K. Perera S.A. Song Y. et al.Nat. Med. 2008; 14: 1351-1356Crossref PubMed Scopus (1087) Google Scholar) has led to multiple trials of the “horizontal” combination of AKT or PI3K inhibitors in combination with MEK inhibitors. In addition, the “vertical” combination of MEK and RAF inhibitors is being tried in melanoma (Infante et al., 2011Infante J.R. Falchook G.S. Lawrence D.P. Weber J.S. Kefford R.F. Bendell J.C. Kurzrock R. Shapiro G. Kudchadkar R.R. Long G.V. et al.J. Clin. Oncol. 2011; 29: CRA8503Google Scholar). If future results of such phase II trials were truly distinctive, including high partial and perhaps complete response rates in relatively unresponsive cancers, such combinations might be directly submitted as new drug applications or might proceed to phase III trials comparing new combinations against the accepted standard of care. Until recently, preclinical therapeutic profiling was typically confined to the analysis of a handful of human cancer cell lines. As such, preclinical testing is conducted on fewer cancer cell lines than the number of human patients treated in even exploratory trials. Under such conditions, it is unreasonable to expect either robust preclinical prediction of the clinical utility of a candidate therapeutic or the preclinical discovery and validation of predictive biomarkers. In simple terms, the test sets are too small. Ideally, preclinical models would be of sufficient robustness and used at sufficient scale so that clinical failure would be reduced to zero. The complexity of human cancer makes it unlikely that this landmark will be attained; nonetheless, progress toward this goal will be of unquestionable benefit. The “required” elements of a robust preclinical infrastructure include molecularly defined model systems that are directly reflective of their human counterparts and sufficient model numbers for one to approach the disease diversity found in humans. Additionally, the preservation of stromal-epithelial interactions, in particular those occurring through ligand-receptor pairs, along with the ability to study cancer in the setting of a functioning immune system, are vitally important. Lastly, the ability to replicate disease progression and to examine sufficient intratumoral heterogeneity to enable the study of resistance are desirable for such an infrastructure. It is self-evident that no single class of preclinical models will satisfy such requirements. Moreover, each model system will have distinct advantages and weaknesses. Thus, the monolithic view that there is a single best system for the preclinical study of therapeutic effect is naive. It is reasonable, therefore, to take a multipronged approach with the paramount commonality that each model is related to human cancer through detailed molecular characterization. The in vitro study of cancer cell lines is the only current method for characterizing therapeutic effect across hundreds of representative disease models derived from bona fide human tumors. The artificial nature of cell culture systems has many limitations, including a limit to the spectrum of human cancer that can be adequately represented. Nonetheless, cell-autonomous growth inhibitory effects can be robustly studied in many instances. Prior efforts at systematic profiling, including the NCI60, were limited by the small sample size and the lack of molecular characterization. Two efforts to rectify this deficit have now characterized both the molecular constituents and drug sensitivity of many hundreds of cell lines. The Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia project (http://www.broadinstitute.org/ccle) has completed the expression profiling, the copy number analysis, and the exon sequencing of ∼1600 genes across 949 cell lines available through commercial sources. The MGH-Sanger cell line project (Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer; http://www.cancerRxgene.org) has completed the expression and copy number analysis of 800 cancer cell lines, as well as exon sequencing of 65 genes commonly mutated in cancer. Full genomic exome sequencing will be completed by the end of 2011. These genomic parameters are being correlated with drug responses to a panel of 135 anticancer small molecules. Renewed interest in studying human tumors without the requirement for in vitro growth has led to the development of primary human tumor explants for propagation in immunocompromised animals. This approach allows for the development of tumor models characterized by molecular alterations that appear difficult to maintain during in vitro growth. In addition, the function of key developmental pathways (e.g., the Hedgehog pathway) are much more likely to be preserved. Finally, the role of the murine stroma in supporting the growth of human cancers can in some instances reflect the human stromal response. For example, in pancreatic cancers, tumor production of Hedgehog ligands leads to stromal Hh-pathway activation. In turn, inhibition of stromal Hh pathway activation by SMO inhibitors leads to an antitumor response (Yauch et al., 2008Yauch R.L. Gould S.E. Scales S.J. Tang T. Tian H. Ahn C.P. Marshall D. Fu L. Januario T. Kallop D. et al.Nature. 2008; 455: 406-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (775) Google Scholar). Genetically engineered mouse (GEM) models have the intrinsic advantage of preserving stromal-to-epithelial interactions and a competent immune system. GEM models are increasingly reflective of the genetic alterations seen in some human cancers and likely harbor a high degree of genetic heterogeneity such that relevant resistance mechanisms can be rapidly identified (Buonamici et al., 2010Buonamici S. Williams J. Morrissey M. Wang A. Guo R. Vattay A. Hsiao K. Yuan J. Green J. Ospina B. et al.Sci. Transl. Med. 2010; 2: 51ra70Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). These systems remain limited by the necessity of staging large numbers of mice for even rudimentary preclinical trials, and hence transplantable versions of GEM-derived tumors might provide a more tractable approach. Finally, the rapid advances in next-generation sequencing throughput make it worth revisiting spontaneous or carcinogen-induced murine cancers, along with cancers arising in mice with targeted disruption of DNA repair pathways. Here, tumors can be collected in large numbers, and as sequencing costs drop, the full complement of genetic alterations will be understood. Such models could then be accepted or rejected as representatives of human disease based on a genetic comparison. This might allow the rapid development of a large array of genetically complex transplantable murine tumors. The growing evidence that preclinical models, when used in robust numbers and when accurately characterized, can be helpful in guiding clinical development should renew investment in building these models as a commonly available resource for wider-spread use. The treatment of the majority of noninfectious medical illness remains largely based on phenotype. For example, diabetic therapy is largely confined to the lowering of blood glucose, the most readily measured “phenotype” of this complex disease. The progress toward understanding genetic mechanisms of disease has been notable in those medical illnesses caused by Mendelian inherited genetic alterations; however, progress in defining causally associated genetic variants has been slower. Limitations to progress in the genetic definition of medical disease have come in two forms: (1) the need to more precisely define distinct subdisease phenotypes so that genetically diverse diseases are not admixed and (2) an incomplete ability to analyze genetic variation, including rare variants across large sample sets. As is the case for cancer, we can see the near-term end of the second roadblock. And with sufficient attention to the first, the future discovery of new genetically defined pathways is likely. The discovery of complement pathway genetic variants as the largest attributable factor in the pathogenesis of macular degeneration is emblematic of the transformation that awaits (Edwards et al., 2005Edwards A.O. Ritter III, R. Abel K.J. Manning A. Panhuysen C. Farrer L.A. Science. 2005; 308: 421-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (1968) Google Scholar, Haines et al., 2005Haines J.L. Hauser M.A. Schmidt S. Scott W.K. Olson L.M. Gallins P. Spencer K.L. Kwan S.Y. Noureddine M. Gilbert J.R. et al.Science. 2005; 308: 419-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (1973) Google Scholar, Klein et al., 2005Klein R.J. Zeiss C. Chew E.Y. Tsai J.Y. Sackler R.S. Haynes C. Henning A.K. SanGiovanni J.P. Mane S.M. Mayne S.T. et al.Science. 2005; 308: 385-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (3301) Google Scholar). Following the definition of disease-causing genetic variants, the same challenges seen in cancer are likely to arise. First, the druggability gap will pose a substantial challenge. As an example, the identification of genetic alterations in hemoglobin has not led to a major advancement in medical therapy of sickle cell anemia and is reflective of the same difficulty faced in treating loss-of-function mutations in tumor suppressor genes. Though therapeutic resistance through a hypermutable genome is unlikely to be a common theme in nononcologic medical disease, adaptive resistance through pathway and endocrine remodeling likely suggests that combination therapy of medical illness will be essential. Lastly, though cancer models are not ideal, the situation in the medical disease area is far worse. For most commonly used therapeutic models (collagen-induced arthritis, chemical-induced fibrosis), we have little to no evidence that they mimic and/or reflect the human disease. Furthermore, in most cases, only one model system is used at all. Again, the likelihood that this testing paradigm will be predictive of human therapeutic success is low. A key challenge in these areas is to take emerging genetic data derived from patient-based studies and create models (likely starting with GEMs) based on the most relevant genetic alterations both alone and in combination. The completion of the human genome project provided a roadmap to the eventual understanding of disease genomes. Genetic drivers of disease are now being elucidated and will allow us to transform the treatment of human illness. Though substantial, the hurdles to fully realizing this transformation can be overcome to drive the next stages of innovation and investment.

https://openalex.org/W2035302428,"Expression of viral proteins causes important epigenetic changes leading to abnormal cell growth. Whether viral proteins directly target histone methyltransferases (HMTs), a key family enzyme for epigenetic regulation, and modulate their enzymatic activities remains elusive. Here we show that the E6 proteins of both low-risk and high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) interact with three coactivator HMTs, CARM1, PRMT1 and SET7, and downregulate their enzymatic activities in vitro and in HPV-transformed HeLa cells. Furthermore, these three HMTs are required for E6 to attenuate p53 transactivation function. Mechanistically, E6 hampers CARM1- and PRMT1-catalyzed histone methylation at p53-responsive promoters, and suppresses the binding of p53 to chromatinized DNA independently of E6-mediated p53 degradation. p53 pre-methylated at lysine-372 (p53K372 mono-methylation) by SET7 protects p53 from E6-induced degradation. Consistently, E6 downregulates p53K372 mono-methylation and thus reduces p53 protein stability. As a result of the E6-mediated inhibition of HMT activity, expression of p53 downstream genes is suppressed. Together, our results not only reveal a clever approach for the virus to interfere with p53 function, but also demonstrate the modulation of HMT activity as a novel mechanism of epigenetic regulation by a viral oncoprotein."
https://openalex.org/W2039038314,"Tyrosine kinase receptors have an essential role in various aspects of tumor progression. In particular, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and its ligands have been implicated in the growth and dissemination of a wide array of human carcinomas. Here, we describe an EGFR-mediated signaling pathway that regulates human pancreatic carcinoma cell invasion and metastasis, yet does not influence the growth of primary tumors. In fact, ligation/activation of EGFR induces Src-dependent phosphorylation of two critical tyrosine residues of p130CAS, leading to the assembly of a Crk-associated substrate (CAS)/Nck1 complex that promotes Ras-associated protein-1 (Rap1) signaling. Importantly, GTP loading of Rap1 is specifically required for pancreatic carcinoma cell migration on vitronectin but not on collagen. Furthermore, Rap1 activation is required for EGFR-mediated metastasis in vivo without impacting primary tumor growth. These findings identify a molecular pathway that promotes the invasive/metastatic properties of human pancreatic carcinomas driven by EGFR."
https://openalex.org/W2007584318,"Background There is a great interest in understanding and exploiting protein-protein associations as new routes for treating human disease. However, these associations are difficult to structurally characterize or model although the number of X-ray structures for protein-protein complexes is expanding. One feature of these complexes that has received little attention is the role of water molecules in the interfacial region. Methodology A data set of 4741 water molecules abstracted from 179 high-resolution (≤ 2.30 Å) X-ray crystal structures of protein-protein complexes was analyzed with a suite of modeling tools based on the HINT forcefield and hydrogen-bonding geometry. A metric termed Relevance was used to classify the general roles of the water molecules. Results The water molecules were found to be involved in: a) (bridging) interactions with both proteins (21%), b) favorable interactions with only one protein (53%), and c) no interactions with either protein (26%). This trend is shown to be independent of the crystallographic resolution. Interactions with residue backbones are consistent for all classes and account for 21.5% of all interactions. Interactions with polar residues are significantly more common for the first group and interactions with non-polar residues dominate the last group. Waters interacting with both proteins stabilize on average the proteins' interaction (−0.46 kcal mol−1), but the overall average contribution of a single water to the protein-protein interaction energy is unfavorable (+0.03 kcal mol−1). Analysis of the waters without favorable interactions with either protein suggests that this is a conserved phenomenon: 42% of these waters have SASA ≤ 10 Å2 and are thus largely buried, and 69% of these are within predominantly hydrophobic environments or “hydrophobic bubbles”. Such water molecules may have an important biological purpose in mediating protein-protein interactions."
https://openalex.org/W1977900828,"Wooded pastures with ancient trees were formerly abundant throughout Europe, but during the last century, grazing has largely been abandoned often resulting in dense forests. Ancient trees constitute habitat for many declining and threatened species, but the effects of secondary woodland on the biodiversity associated with these trees are largely unknown. We tested for difference in species richness, occurrence, and abundance of a set of nationally and regionally red-listed epiphytic lichens between ancient oaks located in secondary woodland and ancient oaks located in open conditions. We refined the test of the effect of secondary woodland by also including other explanatory variables. Species occurrence and abundance were modelled jointly using overdispersed zero-inflated Poisson models. The richness of the red-listed lichens on ancient oaks in secondary woodland was half of that compared with oaks growing in open conditions. The species-level analyses revealed that this was mainly the result of lower occupancy of two of the study species. The tree-level abundance of one species was also lower in secondary woodland. Potential explanations for this pattern are that the study lichens are adapted to desiccating conditions enhancing their population persistence by low competition or that open, windy conditions enhance their colonisation rate. This means that the development of secondary woodland is a threat to red-listed epiphytic lichens. We therefore suggest that woody vegetation is cleared and grazing resumed in abandoned oak pastures. Importantly, this will also benefit the vitality of the oaks."
https://openalex.org/W2073009647,"Nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) inducing kinase (NIK) is a MAP3K that regulates the activation of NF-κB. NIK is often highly expressed in tumor cells, including melanoma, but the significance of this in melanoma progression has been unclear. Tissue microarray analysis of NIK expression reveals that dysplastic nevi (n=22), primary (n=15) and metastatic melanoma (n=13) lesions showed a statistically significant elevation in NIK expression when compared with benign nevi (n=30). Moreover, when short hairpin RNA techniques were used to knock-down NIK, the resultant NIK-depleted melanoma cell lines exhibited decreased proliferation, increased apoptosis, delayed cell cycle progression and reduced tumor growth in a mouse xenograft model. As expected, when NIK was depleted there was decreased activation of the non-canonical NF-κB pathway, whereas canonical NF-κB activation remained intact. NIK depletion also resulted in reduced expression of genes that contribute to tumor growth, including CXCR4, c-MYC and c-MET, and pro-survival factors such as BCL2 and survivin. These changes in gene expression are not fully explained by the attenuation of the non-canonical NF-κB pathway. Shown here for the first time is the demonstration that NIK modulates β-catenin-mediated transcription to promote expression of survivin. NIK-depleted melanoma cells exhibited downregulation of survivin as well as other β-catenin regulated genes including c-MYC, c-MET and CCND2. These data indicate that NIK mediates both β-catenin and NF-κB regulated transcription to modulate melanoma survival and growth. Thus, NIK may be a promising therapeutic target for melanoma."
https://openalex.org/W2032194098,"Tetraspanin CD151 has been implicated in metastasis through forming complexes with different molecular partners. In this study, we mapped tetraspanin web proteins centered on CD151, in order to explore the role of CD151 complexes in the progression of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Immunoprecipitation was used to isolate tetraspanin complexes from HCCLM3 cells using a CD151 antibody, and associated proteins were identified by mass spectrometry. The interaction of CD151 and its molecular partners, and their roles in invasiveness and metastasis of HCC cells were assayed through disruption of the CD151 network. Finally, the clinical implication of CD151 complexes in HCC patients was also examined. In this study, we identified 58 proteins, characterized the tetraspanin CD151 web, and chose integrin β1 as a main partner to further investigate. When the CD151/integrin β1 complex in HCC cells was disrupted, migration, invasiveness, secretion of matrix metalloproteinase 9, and metastasis were markedly influenced. However, both CD151 and integrin β1 expression were untouched. HCC patients with high expression of CD151/integrin β1 complex had the poorest prognosis of the whole cohort of patients. Together, our data show that CD151 acts as an important player in the progression of HCC in an integrin β1-dependent manner."
https://openalex.org/W1997356660,"Bone marrow (BM) angiogenesis has an important role in the initiation and progression of multiple myeloma (MM). We looked at novel mechanisms of vessel formation in patients with MM through a comparative proteomic analysis between BM endothelial cells (ECs) of patients with active MM (MMECs) and ECs of patients with monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGECs) and of subjects with benign anemia (normal ECs). Four proteins were found overexpressed in MMECs: filamin A, vimentin, α-crystallin B and 14-3-3ζ/δ protein, not yet linked to overangiogenic phenotype. These proteins gave a typical distribution in the BM of MM patients and in MMECs versus MGECs, plausibly according to a different functional state. Their expression was enhanced by vascular endothelial growth factor, fibroblast growth factor 2, hepatocyte growth factor and MM plasma cell conditioned medium in step with enhancement of MMEC angiogenesis. Their silencing RNA knockdown affected critical MMEC angiogenesis-related functions, such as spreading, migration and tubular morphogenesis. A gradual stabilization of 14-3-3ζ/δ protein was observed, with transition from normal ECs to MGECs and MMECs that may be a critical step for the angiogenic switch in MMECs and maintenance of the cell overangiogenic phenotype. These proteins were substantially impacted by anti-MM drugs, such as bortezomib, lenalidomide and panobinostat. Results suggest that these four proteins could be new targets for the antiangiogenic management of MM patients."
https://openalex.org/W2087824118,"Today, more than ever, basic science research provides significant opportunities to advance our understanding about the genetic basis of human disease. Close interactions among laboratory, computational, and clinical research communities will be crucial to ensure that genomic discoveries advance medical science and, ultimately, improve human health. Today, more than ever, basic science research provides significant opportunities to advance our understanding about the genetic basis of human disease. Close interactions among laboratory, computational, and clinical research communities will be crucial to ensure that genomic discoveries advance medical science and, ultimately, improve human health. The potential for the burgeoning knowledge of genome structure and function to improve medical care has long been anticipated (Collins, 1999Collins F.S. Ann. N Y Acad. Sci. 1999; 882 (discussion 56–65): 42-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), but until very recently, the actual clinical application of genomics has been limited (Green and Guyer, 2011Green E.D. Guyer M.S. National Human Genome Research InstituteNature. 2011; 470: 204-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (742) Google Scholar). Despite concerns about the pace of medically relevant genomic discoveries and the implementation of genomic medicine (clinical care based on or influenced by knowledge of a patient's specific genomic variants) (Varmus, 2010Varmus H. N. Engl. J. Med. 2010; 362: 2028-2029Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), growing numbers of encouraging examples are now in hand. Early case reports of genomic-based diagnoses leading to altered treatment and an improved clinical course, facilitated by advancing genomic technologies such as whole-exome and -genome sequencing, illustrate the potential of genomically informed medicine for improving clinical care. Such reports also demonstrate the critical role that basic science approaches play in characterizing implicated variants and pointing toward more effective treatments. Here, we describe several recent successes in genomic medicine that illustrate the critical interplay between basic and translational researchers that will be required to make the routine use of genomic medicine a reality. The potential of whole-exome sequencing for identifying the genetic cause of a mysterious and disabling disease and, in some cases, for illuminating a path toward effective treatment was vividly demonstrated by the desperate case of a young boy with severe, intractable, and atypical inflammatory bowel disease (Worthey et al., 2011Worthey E.A. Mayer A.N. Syverson G.D. Helbling D. Bonacci B.B. Decker B. Serpe J.M. Dasu T. Tschannen M.R. Veith R.L. et al.Genet. Med. 2011; 13: 255-262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar). He failed to respond to conventional treatment and progressively worsened. The only treatment option remaining was hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. In the absence of a clear diagnosis, clinicians were concerned about subjecting the boy to an invasive procedure with unknown chances for survival. Whole-exome sequencing provided the key diagnostic clue: a nonsynonymous change in XIAP, a gene involved in apoptosis. Functional studies quickly confirmed that the mutation caused aberrant XIAP function. These findings, and the known morbidity risk of XIAP deficiency-related hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, tipped the balance in favor of stem cell transplantation. The patient survived the procedure and is now well 1 year later (D. Dimmock, personal communication). There is little doubt among the clinical and laboratory teams that this course of treatment—a high-risk gamble justified only upon identification of the presumed causal mutation—saved the patient's life. Genomic analysis is a cornerstone of the National Institutes of Health's Undiagnosed Diseases Program (http://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/Resources.aspx?PageID=31), and it recently proved invaluable for studying three families with severe, symptomatic arterial calcifications (St Hilaire et al., 2011St Hilaire C. Ziegler S.G. Markello T.C. Brusco A. Groden C. Gill F. Carlson-Donohoe H. Lederman R.J. Chen M.Y. Yang D. et al.N. Engl. J. Med. 2011; 364: 432-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). Several of the affected individuals had disabling intermittent claudication with extensive occlusion of the iliofemoral arterial system due to heavy calcification. One family was consanguineous (a third-cousin marriage), so genome-wide single-nucleotide polymorphism arrays were used to identify genomic regions that were homozygous in all affected siblings but heterozygous in the unaffected parents. The only such region included three genes implicated in cellular pathways potentially involved in calcification. One of these, NT5E, codes for the protein CD73, which is involved in the same pathway as a gene associated with generalized arterial calcification of infancy. Targeted sequencing of the affected siblings revealed a homozygous nonsense mutation in NT5E, and quantitative PCR analysis demonstrated decreased NT5E expression in cultured fibroblasts from two of the affected siblings. Studies of two other affected families detected missense and nonsense NT5E mutations in homozygous or compound heterozygous states. A series of elegant experiments revealed markedly reduced CD73 levels and absent CD73 enzymatic activity in fibroblasts from affected patients, with the latter rescued by transfection with a CD73-encoding lentiviral vector. Fibroblasts carrying the NT5E mutation also showed excessive staining for tissue-nonspecific alkaline phosphatase (TNAP), a key enzyme for calcification, as well as abundant calcium phosphate crystal formation. These phenotypes were ameliorated by CD73 transfection or treatment with either adenosine or an inhibitor of alkaline phosphatase. Elucidating the precise molecular defect in this condition enables consideration of treatments affecting other components of this calcification pathway and may shed light on potential treatments for ectopic tissue calcification in other disorders. These two notable successes are encouraging, but it is sobering to recognize that whole-genome analysis has failed to reveal the cause of a rare genetic disease in the majority of cases studied to date. More robust approaches for genome analysis are being developed to study the thousands of genetic disorders for which the molecular basis remains unknown. Pharmacogenomics is another area where genomic discoveries can be leveraged to improve clinical care. Genotype-targeted treatment with clopidogrel represents a prototypic pharmacogenomic advance facilitated by basic science investigation of the effect of specific genetic variants. Clopidogrel is a widely prescribed antiplatelet drug that binds to the platelet P2Y12 receptor with wide interindividual variability in response (Roden and Shuldiner, 2010Roden D.M. Shuldiner A.R. Circulation. 2010; 122: 445-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Further study of clopidogrel's mechanism of action showed that it is a pro-drug highly dependent on cytochrome P450 2C19 for activation. Up to 30% of individuals carrying CYP2C19 variants are unable to generate the active form, and inhibition of platelet aggregation was diminished in these individuals. Some, but not all, studies also point to an associated higher risk for thrombotic cardiovascular events among these CYP2C19 variant carriers. An alternative but more costly anti-P2Y12 drug does not require bioactivation, raising the potential for genotype-targeted selection of individuals needing the higher-cost alternative. Another common 2C19 polymorphism can actually increase clopidogrel metabolism, whereas the effects of several rarer 2C19 variants remain to be studied. Several pilot studies are now underway examining the effectiveness of pre-emptive genotyping in patients. The effects of other 2C19 variants, the role of genotyping versus phenotypic platelet inhibition assays, and the therapeutic potential of other antiplatelet drugs provide fertile ground for basic science investigations that can generate more effective treatments to reduce the risk of thrombotic events. Clinical outcome improvements like these, in conjunction with appropriate changes in physician and patient behavior, will be essential for promoting adoption of such genomic approaches in routine clinical care. Findings from these and related studies will also inform policy development and regulatory oversight, as illustrated by the Food and Drug Administration's promotion of drug-labeling changes (www.fda.gov/drugs/scienceresearch/researchareas/pharmacogenetics/ucm083378.htm). Other pharmacogenomic successes include the documented increased risk for life-threatening adverse reactions to carbamazepine in persons carrying the HLA-B∗1502 allele and the reduction of that risk following genotyping and drug avoidance by carriers of the risk allele (Wilke and Dolan, 2011Wilke R.A. Dolan M.E. JAMA. 2011; 306: 306-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). HLA-mediated risk for adverse drug reactions remains poorly understood but is suspected to involve HLA-allele-specific presentation of key drug moieties to immune-activating cells—an area ripe for basic investigation. Another potent pharmacogenomic example is the BRAF kinase inhibitor vemurafenib. Patients with metastatic melanoma whose tumors carry the activating BRAF V600E somatic mutation respond dramatically, with improved rates of survival (Chapman et al., 2011Chapman P.B. Hauschild A. Robert C. Haanen J.B. Ascierto P. Larkin J. Dummer R. Garbe C. Testori A. Maio M. et al.BRIM-3 Study GroupN. Engl. J. Med. 2011; 364: 2507-2516Crossref PubMed Scopus (6111) Google Scholar). The potential for vemurafenib and other BRAF kinase inhibitors to improve health spans of other cancer patients carrying the BRAF V600E mutation is being investigated and may be an initial step in the long-anticipated classification of cancers based on molecular taxonomy rather than organ of origin and histopathology. These examples demonstrate the enormous potential of basic research to contribute key insights about the phenotypic consequences of disease-associated variants that, in turn, lead to changes in patient care. Although genetic variants of large effect with clear functional impact may be more readily identified in familial or isolated cases of severe disease, such as those described above, recent studies have demonstrated the important new areas of research catalyzed by studying smaller-effect loci identified in genome-wide association studies (GWAS) (Ernst et al., 2011Ernst J. Kheradpour P. Mikkelsen T.S. Shoresh N. Ward L.D. Epstein C.B. Zhang X. Wang L. Issner R. Coyne M. et al.Nature. 2011; 473: 43-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (2062) Google Scholar). For example, 80% or more of the genomic regions implicated in the GWAS conducted to date are intronic or intergenic (http://www.genome.gov/gwastudies), with disease-associated variants being significantly enriched in enhancer elements (Ernst et al., 2011Ernst J. Kheradpour P. Mikkelsen T.S. Shoresh N. Ward L.D. Epstein C.B. Zhang X. Wang L. Issner R. Coyne M. et al.Nature. 2011; 473: 43-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (2062) Google Scholar). Together, these findings make detailed investigation of genetically associated noncoding genomic regions a high priority, yet our functional understanding of noncoding regions is in its relative infancy and will be complicated by their greater genomic variation compared to coding regions (1000 Genomes Project Consortium, 20101000 Genomes Project ConsortiumNature. 2010; 467: 1061-1073Crossref PubMed Scopus (5936) Google Scholar). Variants in gene regulatory regions will undoubtedly prove to be important in disease causation, but their role in pathogenesis will also be complex and difficult to define compared to the coding variants represented by the recent discoveries described above and the overwhelming majority of disease-causing mutations reported to date. For genomic medicine to be successful, basic science advances are also needed to promote development of low-cost, rapid, and clinically available technologies for detecting genomic variants. Although the advent of genome-wide genotyping arrays revolutionized identification of disease-associated loci, this and other genomic technologies (such as genome sequencing) remain largely unavailable outside major research laboratories. The requisite data analysis and quality control will likely keep these technologies out of the typical clinical laboratory for some time. This is unfortunately also true for methods to detect variants in targeted genes recognized to have significant clinical implications. Although becoming increasingly available, whole-exome and -genome sequencing presents significant challenges with respect to data analysis, interpretation, and display. Robust yet easy-to-utilize bioinformatic tools are urgently needed for analyzing genome sequence data, providing to clinicians only the information about genomic variants that is relevant to a patient's care. Our ability to define the role of genomic variation in human disease is growing at an ever-accelerating pace. As revealed in the above examples, using these advances to directly improve patient care will require close interactions between the basic and clinical research communities. The insights resulting from genomic knowledge moving freely between the laboratory and the clinic hold great promise for the implementation of genomic medicine.

To determine whether collagen XXIII facilitates cancer cell metastasis in vivo and to establish a function for collagen XXIII in cancer progression, collagen XXIII knockdown cells were examined for alterations in in vivo metastasis as well as in vitro cell adhesion. In experimental and spontaneous xenograft models of metastasis, H460 cells expressing collagen XXIII shRNA formed fewer lung metastases than control cells. Loss of collagen XXIII in H460 cells also impaired cell adhesion, anchorage-independent growth and cell seeding to the lung, but did not affect cell proliferation. Corroborating a role for collagen XXIII in cell adhesion, overexpression of collagen XXIII in H1299 cells, which do not express endogenous collagen XXIII, enhanced cell adhesion. Consequent reduction in OB-cadherin, alpha-catenin, gamma-catenin, beta-catenin, vimentin and galectin-3 protein expression was also observed in response to loss of collagen XXIII. This study suggests a potential role for collagen XXIII in mediating metastasis by facilitating cell-cell and cell-matrix adhesion as well as anchorage-independent cell growth."
https://openalex.org/W2023172132,"Understanding the mechanisms that promote aberrant tumour cell survival is critical for the determination of novel strategies to combat colorectal cancer (CRC). We have recently shown that the anti-apoptotic protein BAG-1, highly expressed in pre-malignant and CRC tissue, can potentiate cell survival through regulating NF-κB transcriptional activity. In this study, we identify a novel complex between BAG-1 and the p50–p50 NF-κB homodimers, implicating BAG-1 as a co-regulator of an atypical NF-κB pathway. Importantly, the BAG-1-p50 complex was detected at gene regulatory sequences including the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and COX-2 (PTGS2) genes. Suppression of BAG-1 expression using small interfering RNA was shown to increase EGFR and suppress COX-2 expression in CRC cells. Furthermore, mouse embryonic fibroblasts derived from the NF-κB1 (p105/p50) knock-out mouse were used to demonstrate that p50 expression was required for BAG-1 to suppress EGFR expression. This was shown to be functionally relevant as attenuation of BAG-1 expression increased ligand activated phosphorylation of EGFR in CRC cells. In summary, this paper identifies a novel role for BAG-1 in modulating gene expression through interaction with the p50–p50 NF-κB complexes. Data presented led us to propose that BAG-1 can act as a selective regulator of p50–p50 NF-κB responsive genes in colorectal tumour cells, potentially important for the promotion of cell survival in the context of the fluctuating tumour microenvironment. As BAG-1 expression is increased in the developing adenoma through to metastatic lesions, understanding the function of the BAG-1-p50 NF-κB complexes may aid in identifying strategies for both the prevention and treatment of CRC."
https://openalex.org/W2067805465,"Clinical observations, as well as data obtained from the analysis of genetically engineered mouse models, firmly established the gain-of-function (GOF) properties of certain p53 mutations. However, little is known about the underlying mechanisms. We have used two independent microarray platforms to perform a comprehensive and global analysis of tumors arising in a model of metastatic skin cancer progression, which compares the consequences of a GOF p53R172H mutant vs p53 deficiency. DNA profiling revealed a higher level of genomic instability in GOF vs loss-of-function (LOF) p53 squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs). Moreover, GOF p53 SCCs showed preferential amplification of Myc with a corresponding increase in its expression and deregulation of Aurora Kinase A. Fluorescent in situ hybridization confirmed amplification of Myc in primary GOF p53 SCCs and its retention in metastatic tumors. We also identified by RNA profiling distinct gene expression profiles in GOF p53 tumors, which included enriched integrin and Rho signaling, independent of tumor stage. Thus, the progression of GOF p53 papillomas to carcinoma was marked by the acquisition of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and metastatic signatures. In contrast, LOF p53 tumors showed enrichment of genes associated with cancer proliferation and chromosomal instability. Collectively, these observations suggest that genomic instability has a prominent role in the early stages of GOF p53 tumor progression (that is, papillomas), whereas it is implicated at a later stage in LOF p53 tumors (that is, SCCs). This model will allow us to identify specific targets in mutant p53 SCCs, which may lead to the development of new therapeutic agents for the treatment of metastatic SCCs."
https://openalex.org/W2079679541,"The derivation of induced human pluripotent stem cells (hiPS) has generated significant enthusiasm particularly for the prospects of cell-based therapy. But there are concerns about the suitability of iPS cells for in vivo applications due in part to the introduction of potentially oncogenic transcription factors via viral vectors. Recently developed lentiviral vectors allow the excision of viral reprogramming factors and the development of transgene-free iPS lines. However it is unclear if reprogramming strategy has an impact on the differentiation potential and the in vivo behavior of hiPS progeny. Here we subject viral factor-free, c-myc-free and conventionally reprogrammed four-factor human iPS lines to a further challenge, by analyzing their differentiation potential along the 3 neural lineages and over extended periods of time in vitro, as well as by interrogating their ability to respond to local environmental cues by grafting into the striatum. We demonstrate similar and efficient differentiation into neurons, astrocytes and oligodendrocytes among all hiPS and human ES line controls. Upon intracranial grafting in the normal rat (Sprague Dawley), precursors derived from all hiPS lines exhibited good survival and response to environmental cues by integrating into the subventricular zone, acquiring phenotypes typical of type A, B or C cells and migrating along the rostral migratory stream into the olfactory bulb. There was no teratoma or other tumor formation 12 weeks after grafting in any of the 26 animals used in the study. Thus neither factor excision nor persistence of c-myc impact the behavior of hiPS lines in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1990140821,"Background The LightCycler® Mycobacterium Detection Kit based on real-time PCR technology for the detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Mycobacterium avium and Mycobacterium kansasii was recently developed. This study evaluated its analytical sensitivity, specificity and reproducibility. Methodology/Principal Findings Plasmid standards were prepared and used to determine the limit of detection. The assay was also performed against organisms other than mycobacteria, other mycobacterial strains and interfering substances to exclude cross-reactivity and interference. Reference standards were prepared and tested to assess the assay's reproducibility. All PCR assays were performed using the LightCycler® 2.0 Instrument. The detection limit for M. tuberculosis was 28 copies per microlitre. Neither cross-reactivity nor interference occurred with non-mycobacterial organisms and substances tested. Overall reproducibility for consecutive measurements, run-to-run, lot-to-lot, day-to-day and laboratory-to-laboratory achieved a coefficient of variance of less than two percent. Significance The LightCycler® Mycobacterium Detection kit has shown to be a robust and accurate assay with the potential to be used as a rapid TB diagnostic test."

https://openalex.org/W1989036475,"A landmark genomics project is taking shape in Africa that shifts the power and prominence to local scientists. If successful, the program will offer valuable insights into the inheritance of common diseases and reshape the paradigm of foreign-funded research. A landmark genomics project is taking shape in Africa that shifts the power and prominence to local scientists. If successful, the program will offer valuable insights into the inheritance of common diseases and reshape the paradigm of foreign-funded research. In the past few years, large-scale genomics studies have made one point clear: scientists must screen the genomes of diverse populations around the world to decipher the genetic basis of common diseases. But the relationship between genomicists and indigenous populations is often contentious. Although biomedical projects are more positively received than evolutionary studies, the prevailing structure still bears elements of neocolonialism; European and American scientists gather samples and return home to analyze and publish the results. This imbalance breeds skepticism for projects and limits participation. Starting this October, the US's NIH and the UK's Wellcome Trust are joining forces to restructure this paradigm by developing a genomics research network across Africa. Named The Human Heredity and Health in Africa Project, or H3Africa, the program plans to give African researchers an opportunity to bid for research grants to study diverse topics in genomics, from the human microbiome and pharmogenomics to the genetics of communicable and noncommunicable diseases. Those selected for funding will establish or enhance local research facilities in their home country to generate modern sequencing and phenotyping laboratories. These centers will also serve as training facilities and function within a network of clinics and bioinformatics laboratories. The hope is that the genetic work will prove useful in combating diseases that are specifically problematic in Africa but will also yield insight into the genes behind global diseases, like diabetes and cancer. The project naturally elicits the question of “why Africa.” Indeed, it would be less expensive and politically far simpler to have western researchers continue to sample western genes, but that would yield an incomplete picture of human genetic variation. The reason is that Africa is a genetically special place. In May 2009, a study published in Science sent shockwaves through the field of human genetics when it reported the most comprehensive analysis of African genetic diversity to date (Tishkoff et al., 2009, Science 324, 1035–1044). Led by Sarah Tishkoff at the University of Pennsylvania, the study looked at 1327 nuclear microsatellite and insertion/deletion markers in ∼2,400 individuals—a diminutive scale and scope compared to sequencing and genome-wide association studies reported today. But what made Tishkoff's study so extraordinary were the individuals themselves. Most genetic studies in African had sampled only a handful of groups and then generalized their findings. In contrast, Tishkoff and her team acquired samples from 113 distinct populations across the continent, from the Mozabite Berbers of Morocco to the hunter-gatherer San of the Kalahari Desert. The findings made it clear that Africa was home to the highest levels of human genetic diversity on the planet. The reason for this vast diversity is that migration has reduced genetic variation in populations outside of Africa. Just as people today move to take advantage of low housing prices or new jobs, ancient humans moved to find new forms of shelter and food. A major threat faced by these migratory populations was genetic isolation; inbreeding decreased genetic diversity and increased the population's vulnerability to disease. Today, human populations decrease in genetic diversity the further away they get from Africa because founder populations that were formed from other founder populations shrunk the gene pool further. For instance, a study last year reported the complete genome (or exome) sequences of four individuals from a hunter-gatherer population in Southern Africa called Khosians. Despite their geographic proximity, the Khosians were genetically quite far apart, with more differences in their genes than those observed between Europeans and Asians (Schuster et al., 2010, Nature 463, 943–947). Researchers keen to find genes that contribute to diseases are limiting the variations that they have available for study if they restrict their search to individuals outside of Africa. To date, however, genomic studies have focused almost exclusively on westerners. Approximately 96% of the subjects in genome-wide association studies so far are from European descent. Findings from these studies may not generalize to other populations, and they may also miss many alleles that are rare in Europeans but more frequent in other ethnic groups. “A lot of past work has been Eurocentric, and that is not good. We need to know much more about the genetics of humans worldwide, particularly Africa,” says geneticist Nick Patterson at the Broad Institute. Genetically, in comparison to most other human populations, Africans have more haplotypes (combinations of alleles in different loci) and lower levels of linkage disequilibrium (alleles on the same chromosome are more likely to be inherited independently of each other). “These allow for fine-mapping and better localization of risk variants in genomic loci,” says Charles Rotimi, president of the African Society of Human Genetics and director of the Center for Research on Genomics and Global Health at the NIH. But the reasons for going to Africa are not solely genetic ones. “In the developing countries that I've visited, there is a large community with tremendous intellectual capacity. We really want to reverse the history of not involving African communities and see to it that the people of Africa reap the health benefits that will result from analysis of their genetics,” says Jane Peterson, associate director of extramural research at the NIH. “Over the years, it has been very frustrating working in genomics and seeing so few Africans participate. Creating a research environment where young African men and women can pursue this research on their own is everything,” says Dr Rotimi. Yet the path forward is not without obstacles. Whether justified or not, a connection could be made between historic colonial mining of African resources and the western funding of projects that will mine African genomes. Indeed, Africans need not look to colonial times to have concerns about misuse of collected biological resources. In 1983, blood samples were collected from natives of the Nuu-chah-nulth tribe on Vancouver Island by researchers. Rheumatoid arthritis was a serious problem among the indigenous population. The tribe had agreed with the scientists using their blood to search for genes associated with rheumatoid arthritis, with the hopes of alleviating pain in their community. The researchers were unable to find any genetic basis for the arthritis during the 1980s, and when the lead researcher behind this work moved to a new university in 1986, so did the Nuu-chah-nulth blood samples. Over time, the samples were shared with other researchers, and studies were conducted on them that did not involve rheumatoid arthritis at all. When the tribe ultimately discovered that studies, including one on viruses spread by intravenous drug use, were being conducted on their biological samples without their permission, tensions rose and an international debate emerged over the proper care of genetic samples. “This was all about expectations not being met and the people not being involved in the decisions to carry out secondary research after the initial research could not be completed,” explains Laura Arbour at the University of British Columbia, a medical geneticist who was not involved with the Nuu-chah-nulth work. “People who live with health disparity want research money spent in ways that can make a difference for them. But research is a dynamic process. Things change. Results may unexpectedly lead to a different path or the research intended cannot be completed. If new research is being proposed for their samples, they should be included in that discussion too,” she says. To avoid creating a Nuu-chah-nulth debacle and to promote independence from NIH support, keeping research inside of Africa is a priority for the new project. During the next five years, considerable funding—five million dollars a year from the NIH and eight million pounds a year from the Wellcome Trust—is going to be awarded in the form of grants to African researchers by an NIH-selected peer review team. However, collaboration with labs outside of Africa is undoubtedly going to happen, and this means that some African samples may need to leave the continent. Keenly aware that even sending some blood and DNA out of Africa might generate the wrong message, H3Africa is leaving control of biological materials collected in Africa to researchers from the continent. “African researchers will develop the policy for sample distribution,” says Peterson. Yet because the project is still in its infancy, the funders behind H3Africa will not guarantee that an African biorepository for material storage and management will be built. “A biorepository remaining on African soil and under the governance of African researchers and other local stakeholders is an ideal way to reduce the risk of unapproved secondary research,” comments Dr Arbour. “But if the samples need to be analyzed elsewhere, it remains possible that the protective processes can still be effective as long as all parties are on board and the governance remains with the African partners,” she says. It also remains to be determined what diseases will get studied and to what extent they will include diseases that are specifically problematic in Africa, as the project's future revolves around the research proposals that come in during the months ahead. The funding bodies behind H3Africa are not formally declaring any diseases that they are keen to see fought. “I would guess that we will see a mix chosen since one of the key criteria that will be used by the peer reviewers is medical relevance, and there are certainly a lot of highly relevant diseases shared by both Africa and the rest of the world,” says Peterson. But this silence from the funding agency is not stopping individuals from expressing what they would like to see studied. “A distressingly high proportion of young children in Africa pick up lethal diarrhea. I suspect that this has been persisting in Africa for a long time. Since it sets in before reproductive age and selection probably has been playing a role in selecting for infants that can survive the disease, there might be some genetic resistance there, and this may be well worth looking for,” says Patterson. As for Rotimi, he is keen to see sickle cell anemia dealt with. “In some areas of western Africa, heterozygotes can be as common as 20% of the population, while actual sickle cell patients (sufferers) can be up to 3%. Many sufferers never make it to medical facilities alive. In addition, it is often assumed that carriers are entirely normal, but we really do not know that! Research directed at understanding this disease, its complications, and treatment has not received enough scientific attention, and this needs to change,” says Rotimi. Indeed, the project looks well aimed to avoid past pitfalls, and with the right project proposals, it could have a profound impact on our understanding of disease inheritance and human evolution. But there is still a long way to go to narrow the gap between Africans' genetic richness and their power to use it for their own benefit."
