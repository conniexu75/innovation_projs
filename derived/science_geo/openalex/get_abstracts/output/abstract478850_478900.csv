Here, we define the developmental origins of the metanephric mesenchyme (MM), which generates most kidney components. Unexpectedly, we find that posteriorly located T+ MM precursors are developmentally distinct from Osr1+ ureteric bud progenitors during the postgastrulation stage, and we identify phasic Wnt stimulation and stage-specific growth factor addition as molecular cues that promote their development into the MM. We then use this information to derive MM from PSCs. These progenitors reconstitute the 3D structures of the kidney in vitro, including glomeruli with podocytes and renal tubules with proximal and distal regions and clear lumina. Furthermore, the glomeruli are efficiently vascularized upon transplantation. Thus, by reevaluating the developmental origins of metanephric progenitors, we have provided key insights into kidney specification in vivo and taken important steps toward kidney organogenesis in vitro.

Despite the successful achievement of various types of tissues from pluripotent stem cells (PSCs), kidney generation in vitro has remained a challenge for developmental biology and regenerative medicine (Murry and Keller, 2008Murry C.E.

This is partly because the specification of the kidney lineage in vivo has not been well clarified, owing to its complex processes involving the formation of three consecutive primordia (pronephros, mesonephros, and metanephros) during embryogenesis (Saxen, 1987Saxen L. Organogenesis of the Kidney. Cambridge University Press, New York1987Crossref Google Scholar). The pronephros and mesonephros eventually degenerate in females, whereas a portion of the mesonephros in males contributes to a drainage system for the future testis, including the epididymis. The kidney derives from the embryonic metanephros, which develops at the most posterior part of the body trunk. The metanephros is formed by reciprocally inductive interactions between two precursor tissues, namely the metanephric mesenchyme (MM) and the ureteric bud. Cell fate analyses have shown that both the MM and ureteric bud derive from the intermediate mesoderm, which appears around embryonic day 8.5 (E8.5) and expresses the transcription factor Osr1 (Mugford et al., 2008bMugford J.W. Sipilä P. McMahon J.A. McMahon A.P.

However, the mechanisms underlying how the nascent mesoderm becomes committed to the intermediate mesoderm and how the MM and ureteric bud lineage segregate from one another have not been clarified, despite many reports showing the importance of various growth factors during kidney development (Costantini and Kopan, 2010Costantini F.

Moreover, it remains to be elucidated how the anteroposterior axis is formed along the intermediate mesoderm and gives rise to the posteriorly located metanephros. In the present study, we addressed these questions by in vivo lineage-tracing experiments together with in-vitro-directed differentiation systems utilizing sorted embryonic kidney precursors at each developmental stage. Importantly, by establishing conditions for the later stages first, and then moving backward to the earlier stages, we were able to optimize the multistep culture conditions from embryonic precursors toward nephron progenitors. Finally, the protocol established by these strategies was successfully applied to the induction of metanephric nephron progenitors from mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), thereby advocating a model for kidney lineage specification. The MM gives rise to the epithelia of glomeruli (i.e., podocytes) and renal tubules, which constitute the major parts of the nephrons, as shown by cell fate analyses involving labeling of mesenchyme expressing the transcription factor Six2 (Kobayashi et al., 2008Kobayashi A. Valerius M.T. Mugford J.W. Carroll T.J. Self M. Oliver G. McMahon A.P. Six2 defines and regulates a multipotent self-renewing nephron progenitor population throughout mammalian kidney development.Cell Stem Cell. 2008; 3: 169-181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (697) Google Scholar). We previously proved the presence of nephron progenitors by establishing a colony-formation assay. When we plated dissociated metanephric mesenchymal cells, which strongly express Sall1, onto feeder cells stably expressing Wnt4, single cells formed colonies that expressed glomerular and renal tubule markers (Nishinakamura et al., 2001Nishinakamura R. Matsumoto Y. Nakao K. Nakamura K. Sato A. Copeland N.G. Gilbert D.J. Jenkins N.A. Scully S.

Identification of multipotent progenitors in the embryonic mouse kidney by a novel colony-forming assay.Development. 2006; 133: 151-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Therefore, the Sall1high and Six2+ MM represents a nephron progenitor population in the embryonic kidney. Osr1 is another MM marker and also one of the earliest markers for the intermediate mesoderm and is thus continuously expressed in the renal precursor population throughout kidney development (James et al., 2006James R.G. Kamei C.N. Wang Q. Jiang R. Schultheiss T.M.

Biol. 2008; 324: 88-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). We generated Osr1-GFP knockin mice (Figures S1A–S1C available online) and confirmed that GFP was expressed in the intermediate mesoderm at E8.5–E9.5 and the MM at E11.5–E15.5 (Figures 1A–1C). Similar to our previous experiments, the Osr1-GFP+ population sorted from E11.5 and E15.5 embryonic kidneys contained colony-forming nephron progenitors (Table S1). The colonies expressed nephric transcription factors, such as Pax2 and Sall1, as well as markers for differentiated renal tubules (Figures 1D and S1D). Therefore, the Osr1+ MM contains colony-forming nephron progenitors. Next, we searched for cell surface markers that can further enrich the nephron progenitors. At E15.5 and E11.5, Integrina8 (Itga8) was strongly expressed in the capping mesenchyme around the ureteric bud tips, whereas Pdgfra was excluded from the population (Li et al., 2000Li X. Pontén A.

Integrin alpha8beta1 is critically important for epithelial-mesenchymal interactions during kidney morphogenesis.Cell. 1997; 88: 603-613Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar) (Figure 1E). By fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analyses, we identified the existence of Itga8+/Pdgfra− fractions in the Osr1-GFP+ populations of E15.5 and E11.5 embryonic kidneys (Figures 1F and 1G), and colony-forming nephron progenitors were enriched in the Osr1+/Itga8+/Pdgfra− fractions (Table S2). It is of note that not all cells in the Itga8+/Pdgfra− fraction of each specimen were positive for Osr1-GFP, meaning that all three markers were required for identification of the nephron progenitor populations (Figure S1E). We further confirmed the reliability of these cell surface markers using GFP knockin mice for Sall1 and Six2, in which most of the Sall1-GFPhigh or Six2-GFP+ cells were Itga8+/Pdgfra− (Figures 1H and 1I). Therefore, the Osr1-GFP+/Itga8+/Pdgfra− fraction represents the colony-forming nephron progenitors. We next examined the expressions of nephron progenitor markers and the colony-forming abilities of Osr1-GFP+ cells at earlier stages. At E8.5, we did not detect any overlap of GFP with Itga8, and no colonies were formed by the GFP+ population (Figure 1E; Table S1). At E9.5, we detected colony formation by the GFP+ population (0.037% ± 0.013%; Table S1; Figures S2A and S2B). We also found a GFP+ region that was Itga8+/Pdgfra− (Figure 1E), and sorting of the Osr1+/Itga8+/Pdgfra− population enriched the colony-forming cells (1.10% ± 0.26%; Figures 1F and 1G; Table S2). However, even after the enrichment, the colony-forming frequency was significantly lower than those of the Osr1+/Itga8+/Pdgfra− populations from the metanephric region at E10.5 and E11.5 (30.9% ± 1.5% and 50.9% ± 5.2%, respectively; Table S2). In contrast, the colony-forming frequency of the Osr1+/Itga8+/Pdgfra− population from the mesonephric region at E10.5 (1.47% ± 0.20%) was as low as that from E9.5. Because the mesonephros, which is located anterior to the metanephros, develops earlier than the metanephros and forms much fewer nephrons (Saxen, 1987Saxen L. Organogenesis of the Kidney. Cambridge University Press, New York1987Crossref Google Scholar), we hypothesized that the colony-forming cells at E9.5 may represent mesonephric nephron progenitors. Indeed, colony-forming progenitors were only detected among the anterior part of GFP+ cells in the E9.5 embryo (Figure S2C). Furthermore, Pax2 and Six2, which mark nephron progenitors, were predominantly expressed in the anterior part of the intermediate mesoderm (Figure 2A). We further crossed Six2-GFPCreER mice (Kobayashi et al., 2008Kobayashi A. Valerius M.T. Mugford J.W. Carroll T.J. Self M. Oliver G. McMahon A.P. Six2 defines and regulates a multipotent self-renewing nephron progenitor population throughout mammalian kidney development.Cell Stem Cell. 2008; 3: 169-181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (697) Google Scholar) with mice carrying a tdTomato reporter allele (Madisen et al., 2010Madisen L. Zwingman T.A. Sunkin S.M. Oh S.W. Zariwala H.A. Gu H. Ng L.L. Palmiter R.D. Hawrylycz M.J. Jones A.R. et al.A robust and high-throughput Cre reporting and characterization system for the whole mouse brain.Nat. Neurosci. 2010; 13: 133-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (3847) Google Scholar) and injected tamoxifen to transiently activate Cre in the anterior intermediate mesoderm at E9.5. When analyzed at E11.5, labeled cells were detected in the mesonephros, but not in the metanephros (Figure S2D). Therefore, the anterior and posterior parts of the Osr1-GFP+ intermediate mesoderm at E9.5 have different characteristics, and the anterior intermediate mesoderm, which contributes to the mesonephros, may not give rise to the metanephric nephron progenitors. To further investigate the molecular differences and required factors between the early stages of kidney precursor development, we performed microarray and quantitative RT-PCR analyses using the Osr1+/Itga8+/Pdgfra− colony-forming presumptive mesonephric progenitors at E9.5 and metanephric nephron progenitors at E10.5–E11.5 (Figures 2B and S3A). Although both types of progenitors expressed many transcriptional factors in common, such as Osr1, Wt1, Pax2, and Six2, the metanephric progenitors expressed posterior Hox genes including Hoxa10, Hoxa11, and Hoxd12 more abundantly. The Hox11 family genes, which start to be expressed at the posterior end of the embryo around E9.0, are essential for metanephros development by dictating the metanephric region along the anterior-posterior axis in the intermediate mesoderm (Mugford et al., 2008aMugford J.W. Sipilä P. Kobayashi A. Behringer R.R. McMahon A.P. Hoxd11 specifies a program of metanephric kidney development within the intermediate mesoderm of the mouse embryo.Dev.

Hox11 paralogous genes are essential for metanephric kidney induction.Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 1423-1432Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a cell fate-mapping study showed that the Osr1+ intermediate mesoderm at E9.5 contributes to the MM (Mugford et al., 2008bMugford J.W. Sipilä P. McMahon J.A. McMahon A.P. Osr1 expression demarcates a multi-potent population of intermediate mesoderm that undergoes progressive restriction to an Osr1-dependent nephron progenitor compartment within the mammalian kidney.Dev. Biol. 2008; 324: 88-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Therefore, we hypothesized that the non-colony-forming Osr1+/Wt1+/Pax2−/Six2−/posterior Hox+ intermediate mesoderm, which was located posteriorly at E9.5, could be a precursor population for the metanephric nephron progenitors. To test our hypothesis, we sorted Osr1-GFP+ cells from the posterior part of E9.5 embryos and plated them into low-cell-binding plates in the presence of the Rho kinase inhibitor Y27632, which supports cell survival (Watanabe et al., 2007Watanabe K. Ueno M. Kamiya D. Nishiyama A. Matsumura M. Wataya T. Takahashi J.B. Nishikawa S. Nishikawa S. Muguruma K. Sasai Y. A ROCK inhibitor permits survival of dissociated human embryonic stem cells.Nat. Biotechnol. 2007; 25: 681-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (1559) Google Scholar) (Figures 2C and S3B). The cells spontaneously reaggregated and formed spheres within 24 hr. At 48 hr of culture, the aggregates retained intense GFP signals and showed more than 10-fold higher expressions of Pax2, Six2, and Gdnf compared with the starting point (Figures 2D–2F). FACS analyses also showed the emergence of an Osr1+/Itga8+/Pdgfra− population (10.0% ± 0.01% of the total cells; Figures S3C and 2G). When these aggregates were dissociated and stimulated with Wnt4, colony formation was observed (Figure 2H), suggesting in vitro derivation of metanephric nephron progenitors from the posterior intermediate mesoderm. We further addressed the effects of growth factors in this process. The microarray data described above showed the accumulated expressions of Fgf ligands (especially Fgf9 and Fgf20), receptors, and their downstream target genes in the colony-forming populations at both E9.5 and E11.5, whereas the Bmp and Wnt targets were downregulated (Figure S4A). Indeed, inhibition of Fgf signaling, exogenous addition of Bmp4, or high concentrations of a Wnt agonist (3 or 10 μM CHIR99021 [CHIR]), as well as addition of retinoic acid or activin, were inhibitory for the induction of colony-forming progenitors and nephric gene expressions (Figures 2H and S4B), whereas addition of FGF9 or a low concentration of the Wnt agonist (1 μM CHIR) slightly improved the colony formation (Figure 2H). Because Osr1-GFP is expressed by a rather broad population, including the lateral plate mesoderm, we examined the efficacy of these factors using Wt1-GFP knockin mice (Zhou et al., 2008Zhou B. Ma Q. Rajagopal S. Wu S.M. Domian I. Rivera-Feliciano J. Jiang D. von Gise A. Ikeda S. Chien K.R. Pu W.T. Epicardial progenitors contribute to the cardiomyocyte lineage in the developing heart.Nature. 2008; 454: 109-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (779) Google Scholar), which show more restricted expression in a region of the intermediate mesoderm (Figures 2A, 2C, and 2I). Addition of Fgf9 and a low dose of the Wnt agonist synergistically promoted sphere growth and increased colony formation by the spheres (Figures 2J and S4C). Thus, the combination of 1 μM CHIR and Fgf9 (C1F) was optimal for induction of metanephric nephron progenitors from the posterior intermediate mesoderm. These observations are consistent with previous findings showing requirements of Fgf receptors and Fgf9/Fgf20 for the formation and maintenance of the MM, respectively (Barak et al., 2012Barak H. Huh S.H. Chen S. Jeanpierre C. Martinovic J. Parisot M. Bole-Feysot C. Nitschké P. Salomon R. Antignac C. et al.FGF9 and FGF20 maintain the stemness of nephron progenitors in mice and man.Dev.

Role of fibroblast growth factor receptors 1 and 2 in the metanephric mesenchyme.Dev. Biol. 2006; 291: 325-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Next, we searched for an in vitro method to differentiate the mesoderm at earlier stages into MM by way of the E9.5 posterior intermediate mesoderm. One report has shown that both the MM and ureteric bud derive from the intermediate mesoderm, which appears around E8.5 and expresses Osr1 (Mugford et al., 2008bMugford J.W. Sipilä P. McMahon J.A. McMahon A.P. Osr1 expression demarcates a multi-potent population of intermediate mesoderm that undergoes progressive restriction to an Osr1-dependent nephron progenitor compartment within the mammalian kidney.Dev. Biol. 2008; 324: 88-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Several other reports have shown that the ureteric bud originates from the anterior intermediate mesoderm, and its anlage, the Wolffian duct, elongates in an anterior-to-posterior manner, as demonstrated by direct labeling in chick embryos (Atsuta et al., 2013Atsuta Y.

Organogenesis of the Kidney. Cambridge University Press, New York1987Crossref Google Scholar). In murine embryos, the Pax2+/Pax8+ anterior intermediate mesoderm at E8.5, called the pronephric anlage, is supposed to be the equivalent population (Bouchard et al., 2002Bouchard M. Souabni A. Mandler M. Neubüser A. Busslinger M. Nephric lineage specification by Pax2 and Pax8.Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 2958-2970Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar) and is included in the Osr1+ region. Thus, we initially examined the effects of many combinations of growth factors on sorted E8.5 Osr1-GFP+ cells. However, we were unable to induce colony-forming progenitors. Unexpectedly, we experienced colony formation from the Osr1-GFP− fraction when treated with growth factors. Therefore, we hypothesized that the posterior immature mesoderm, which was negative for Osr1, contained prospective nephron progenitors. Deletion of T (Brachyury), a representative marker of the primitive streak and posterior nascent mesoderm, causes a caudal truncation that includes the metanephric region (Herrmann et al., 1990Herrmann B.G. Labeit S. Poustka A. King T.R. Lehrach H. Cloning of the T gene required in mesoderm formation in the mouse.Nature. 1990; 343: 617-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (675) Google Scholar). We first crossed TnEGFP-CreERT2/+ mice (Imuta et al., 2013Imuta Y. Kiyonari H. Jang C.W. Behringer R.R. Sasaki H. Generation of knock-in mice that express nuclear enhanced green fluorescent protein and tamoxifen-inducible Cre recombinase in the notochord from Foxa2 and T loci.Genesis. 2013; 51: 210-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) with mice carrying the tdTomato reporter allele and injected tamoxifen at the gastrulation stage (E6.5 and E7.5), when the initial germ layer formation takes place (Murry and Keller, 2008Murry C.E. Keller G. Differentiation of embryonic stem cells to clinically relevant populations: lessons from embryonic development.Cell. 2008; 132: 661-680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1346) Google Scholar, Tam and Behringer, 1997Tam P.P. Behringer R.R. Mouse gastrulation: the formation of a mammalian body plan.Mech. Dev. 1997; 68: 3-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). When analyzed at E11.5, most of the mesodermal tissues, including the heart, limbs, and kidneys, were labeled (Figures 3A and 3B ). Next, we injected tamoxifen at E8.5 and found that labeled cells were only detected in the lower trunk of the E11.5 embryo, including the MM located at the hindlimb level (Figure 3A). On the other hand, the heart and forelimbs, which are anteriorly located mesodermal tissues, were no longer labeled (Figure 3A). Surprisingly, when we created sections at the metanephric level, only the MM, and not the ureteric bud, was labeled (Figure 3B). These findings indicate that at E8.5, the precursor of the ureteric bud was located anteriorly in the T− population and already segregated from that of the MM, which was localized in T+ posterior nascent mesoderm. These data are consistent with the notion that the ureteric bud originates from the anterior intermediate mesoderm at E8.5 and elongates caudally (Figure 3C). In contrast, when we injected tamoxifen at E9.5, only the tail region was labeled, and no labeled cells were observed in the MM region (Figure 3A), suggesting that the T+ cells at this stage no longer possess the capacity to differentiate into the MM. Taken together, our observations indicate that the precursor of the MM is maintained and posteriorized in the T+ state until the E8.5 postgastrulation stage (Figure 3C). Presumably, this could in part correspond to the “axial progenitor,” which was recently recognized as the source of the caudal body trunk (Wilson et al., 2009Wilson V. Olivera-Martinez I. Storey K.G. Stem cells, signals and vertebrate body axis extension.Development. 2009; 136: 1591-1604Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). These data also reveal differences in the developmental processes between the posteriorly located MM and the anteriorly located mesodermal tissues, such as the heart, which have been successfully induced from PSCs by way of the T+ state in the initial short period of differentiation (Burridge et al., 2012Burridge P.W. Keller G. Gold J.D. Wu J.C. Production of de novo cardiomyocytes: human pluripotent stem cell differentiation and direct reprogramming.Cell Stem Cell. 2012; 10: 16-28Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). Based on the lineage-tracing experiments, we used the sorted E8.5 T+ posterior mesoderm as the starting material to induce metanephric nephron progenitors (Figures 4A–4C). The sorted cells were reaggregated to form spheres and treated with various growth factors, followed by treatment with C1F as described above (Figure 4C, step 3). Because the posterior intermediate mesoderm in E9.5 embryo was marked by expressions of Osr1, Wt1, and posterior Hox genes, we first focused on the growth factors that may affect the expressions of these genes. Synergistic effects of Bmp and Wnt signaling have been reported on the expressions of posterior Hox genes in mouse ESC differentiation (Lengerke et al., 2008Lengerke C. Schmitt S. Bowman T.V. Jang I.H. Maouche-Chretien L. McKinney-Freeman S. Davidson A.J. Hammerschmidt M. Rentzsch F. Green J.B. et al.BMP and Wnt specify hematopoietic fate by activation of the Cdx-Hox pathway.Cell Stem Cell. 2008; 2: 72-82Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar), and retinoic acid signaling is important for the expressions of Wt1 homologs in zebrafish development (Bollig et al., 2009Bollig F. Perner B. Besenbeck B. Köthe S. Ebert C. Taudien S. Englert C. A highly conserved retinoic acid responsive element controls wt1a expression in the zebrafish pronephros.Development. 2009; 136: 2883-2892Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Because simultaneous introduction of retinoic acid, Bmp, and the Wnt agonist did not increase the posterior Hox genes to the levels observed in the embryonic MM (Figures 4D and 4E), we added a “posteriorization phase.” Because canonical Wnt signals are reportedly important for caudal body extension (Wilson et al., 2009Wilson V. Olivera-Martinez I. Storey K.G. Stem cells, signals and vertebrate body axis extension.Development. 2009; 136: 1591-1604Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, Yamaguchi et al., 1999Yamaguchi T.P. Takada S. Yoshikawa Y. Wu N. McMahon A.P. T (Brachyury) is a direct target of Wnt3a during paraxial mesoderm specification.Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 3185-3190Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar), we added a high concentration of the Wnt agonist (10 μM CHIR) in combination with Bmp4. This treatment (Figure 4C, BC10 in step 1) dramatically increased the expressions of posterior Hox genes, and we were able to detect colony formation from the induced cells, although the expression levels of nephric genes were still lower than those in the embryonic MM (Figures 4D–4G). We tried various conditions and found that the combination of activin and retinoic acid, together with Bmp4 and 3 μM CHIR (Figure 4C, ABC3 in; step 2), substantially increased the expressions of nephric genes (Figure 4F). In this optimized three-step condition (BC10 followed by ABC3R and C1F), the cells formed higher numbers of colonies (22.7% ± 3.66%, n = 4) compared with single addition of either activin or retinoic acid (Figure 4G). In the first posteriorization step, the concentration of the canonical Wnt agonist was critically important, and addition of retinoic acid completely inhibited the colony-forming progenitor induction (Figure S5A). In the second step, inhibition of any one of activin, retinoic acid, Bmp, Wnt, or Fgf signaling resulted in a decrease in colony formation (Figure S5B), suggesting that all of these signals were essential. We further examined the temporal kinetics of the gene expressions at every step of the induction process (Figure 4H). In the first step, T, Cdx2, and Tbx6, all of which are posterior nascent mesoderm markers, were expressed and maintained, whereas posterior Hox genes started to increase. In the second step, nephric genes started to be expressed, and in the final step, the expressions of Pax2, Six2, Gdnf, and posterior Hox genes increased to the levels in the embryonic MM. We further confirmed the colocalization of multiple transcript"
https://openalex.org/W2031904808,"Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) is an important aprotic solvent that can solubilize a wide variety of otherwise poorly soluble polar and nonpolar molecules. This, coupled with its apparent low toxicity at concentrations <10%, has led to its ubiquitous use and widespread application. Here, we demonstrate that DMSO induces retinal apoptosis in vivo at low concentrations (5 μl intravitreally dosed DMSO in rat from a stock concentration of 1, 2, 4, and 8% v/v). Toxicity was confirmed in vitro in a retinal neuronal cell line, at DMSO concentrations >1% (v/v), using annexin V, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL), 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT), and AlamarBlue cell viability assays. DMSO concentrations >10% (v/v) have recently been reported to cause cellular toxicity through plasma membrane pore formation. Here, we show the mechanism by which low concentrations (2-4% DMSO) induce caspase-3 independent neuronal death that involves apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) translocation from mitochondria to the nucleus and poly-(ADP-ribose)-polymerase (PARP) activation. These results highlight safety concerns of using low concentrations of DMSO as a solvent for in vivo administration and in biological assays. We recommend that methods other than DMSO are employed for solubilizing drugs but, where no alternative exists, researchers compute absolute DMSO final concentrations and include an untreated control group in addition to DMSO vehicle control to check for solvent toxicity."
https://openalex.org/W2029556699,"The intestinal epithelium continually self-renews and can rapidly regenerate after damage. Lgr5 marks mitotically active intestinal stem cells (ISCs). Importantly, intestinal homeostasis can be maintained after depletion of Lgr5(+) cells due to the activation of Lgr5(-) reserve ISCs. The Lgr5(-) ISC populations are thought to play a similar role during intestinal regeneration following radiation-induced damage. We tested this regeneration hypothesis by combining depletion of Lgr5(+) ISCs with radiation exposure. In contrast to the negligible effect of Lgr5(+) ISC loss during homeostasis, depletion of Lgr5(+) cells during radiation-induced damage and subsequent repair caused catastrophic crypt loss and deterioration of crypt-villus architecture. Interestingly though, we found that crypts deficient for Lgr5(+) cells are competent to undergo hyperplasia upon loss of Apc. These data argue that Lgr5(-) reserve stem cells are radiosensitive and that Lgr5(+) cells are crucial for robust intestinal regeneration following radiation exposure but are dispensable for premalignant hyperproliferation."
https://openalex.org/W2015142714,"Multidrug-resistant (MDR) Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC) strains represent a major threat for tuberculosis (TB) control. Treatment of MDR-TB patients is long and less effective, resulting in a significant number of treatment failures. The development of further resistances leads to extensively drug-resistant (XDR) variants. However, data on the individual reasons for treatment failure, e.g. an induced mutational burst, and on the evolution of bacteria in the patient are only sparsely available. To address this question, we investigated the intra-patient evolution of serial MTBC isolates obtained from three MDR-TB patients undergoing longitudinal treatment, finally leading to XDR-TB. Sequential isolates displayed identical IS6110 fingerprint patterns, suggesting the absence of exogenous re-infection. We utilized whole genome sequencing (WGS) to screen for variations in three isolates from Patient A and four isolates from Patient B and C, respectively. Acquired polymorphisms were subsequently validated in up to 15 serial isolates by Sanger sequencing. We determined eight (Patient A) and nine (Patient B) polymorphisms, which occurred in a stepwise manner during the course of the therapy and were linked to resistance or a potential compensatory mechanism. For both patients, our analysis revealed the long-term co-existence of clonal subpopulations that displayed different drug resistance allele combinations. Out of these, the most resistant clone was fixed in the population. In contrast, baseline and follow-up isolates of Patient C were distinguished each by eleven unique polymorphisms, indicating an exogenous re-infection with an XDR strain not detected by IS6110 RFLP typing. Our study demonstrates that intra-patient microevolution of MDR-MTBC strains under longitudinal treatment is more complex than previously anticipated. However, a mutator phenotype was not detected. The presence of different subpopulations might confound phenotypic and molecular drug resistance tests. Furthermore, high resolution WGS analysis is necessary to accurately detect exogenous re-infection as classical genotyping lacks discriminatory power in high incidence settings."
https://openalex.org/W1989060614,"Sandalwood oil is one of the world's most highly prized essential oils, appearing in many high-end perfumes and fragrances. Extracted from the mature heartwood of several Santalum species, sandalwood oil is comprised mainly of sesquiterpene olefins and alcohols. Four sesquiterpenols, α-, β-, and epi-β-santalol and α-exo-bergamotol, make up approximately 90% of the oil of Santalum album. These compounds are the hydroxylated analogues of α-, β-, and epi-β-santalene and α-exo-bergamotene. By mining a transcriptome database of S. album for candidate cytochrome P450 genes, we cloned and characterized cDNAs encoding a small family of ten cytochrome P450-dependent monooxygenases annotated as SaCYP76F37v1, SaCYP76F37v2, SaCYP76F38v1, SaCYP76F38v2, SaCYP76F39v1, SaCYP76F39v2, SaCYP76F40, SaCYP76F41, SaCYP76F42, and SaCYP76F43. Nine of these genes were functionally characterized using in vitro assays and yeast in vivo assays to encode santalene/bergamotene oxidases and bergamotene oxidases. These results provide a foundation for production of sandalwood oil for the fragrance industry by means of metabolic engineering, as demonstrated with proof-of-concept formation of santalols and bergamotol in engineered yeast cells, simultaneously addressing conservation challenges by reducing pressure on supply of sandalwood from native forests."
https://openalex.org/W2149871714,"Recent molecular phylogenetic studies of the insect order Lepidoptera have robustly resolved family-level divergences within most superfamilies, and most divergences among the relatively species-poor early-arising superfamilies. In sharp contrast, relationships among the superfamilies of more advanced moths and butterflies that comprise the mega-diverse clade Apoditrysia (ca. 145,000 spp.) remain mostly poorly supported. This uncertainty, in turn, limits our ability to discern the origins, ages and evolutionary consequences of traits hypothesized to promote the spectacular diversification of Apoditrysia. Low support along the apoditrysian ""backbone"" probably reflects rapid diversification. If so, it may be feasible to strengthen resolution by radically increasing the gene sample, but case studies have been few. We explored the potential of next-generation sequencing to conclusively resolve apoditrysian relationships. We used transcriptome RNA-Seq to generate 1579 putatively orthologous gene sequences across a broad sample of 40 apoditrysians plus four outgroups, to which we added two taxa from previously published data. Phylogenetic analysis of a 46-taxon, 741-gene matrix, resulting from a strict filter that eliminated ortholog groups containing any apparent paralogs, yielded dramatic overall increase in bootstrap support for deeper nodes within Apoditrysia as compared to results from previous and concurrent 19-gene analyses. High support was restricted mainly to the huge subclade Obtectomera broadly defined, in which 11 of 12 nodes subtending multiple superfamilies had bootstrap support of 100%. The strongly supported nodes showed little conflict with groupings from previous studies, and were little affected by changes in taxon sampling, suggesting that they reflect true signal rather than artifacts of massive gene sampling. In contrast, strong support was seen at only 2 of 11 deeper nodes among the ""lower"", non-obtectomeran apoditrysians. These represent a much harder phylogenetic problem, for which one path to resolution might include further increase in gene sampling, together with improved orthology assignments."
https://openalex.org/W2012072563,"Coffee is one of the world’s most traded agricultural products. Modeling studies have predicted that climate change will have a strong impact on the suitability of current cultivation areas, but these studies have not anticipated possible mitigating effects of the elevated atmospheric [CO2] because no information exists for the coffee plant. Potted plants from two genotypes of Coffea arabica and one of C. canephora were grown under controlled conditions of irradiance (800 μmol m-2 s-1), RH (75%) and 380 or 700 μL CO2 L-1 for 1 year, without water, nutrient or root development restrictions. In all genotypes, the high [CO2] treatment promoted opposite trends for stomatal density and size, which decreased and increased, respectively. Regardless of the genotype or the growth [CO2], the net rate of CO2 assimilation increased (34-49%) when measured at 700 than at 380 μL CO2 L-1. This result, together with the almost unchanged stomatal conductance, led to an instantaneous water use efficiency increase. The results also showed a reinforcement of photosynthetic (and respiratory) components, namely thylakoid electron transport and the activities of RuBisCo, ribulose 5-phosphate kinase, malate dehydrogenase and pyruvate kinase, what may have contributed to the enhancements in the maximum rates of electron transport, carboxylation and photosynthetic capacity under elevated [CO2], although these responses were genotype dependent. The photosystem II efficiency, energy driven to photochemical events, non-structural carbohydrates, photosynthetic pigment and membrane permeability did not respond to [CO2] supply. Some alterations in total fatty acid content and the unsaturation level of the chloroplast membranes were noted but, apparently, did not affect photosynthetic functioning. Despite some differences among the genotypes, no clear species-dependent responses to elevated [CO2] were observed. Overall, as no apparent sign of photosynthetic down-regulation was found, our data suggest that Coffea spp. plants may successfully cope with high [CO2] under the present experimental conditions."
https://openalex.org/W1989764182,"Re-canalization of cerebral vessels in ischemic stroke is pivotal to rescue dysfunctional brain areas that are exposed to moderate hypoxia within the penumbra from irreversible cell death. Goal of the present study was to evaluate the effect of moderate hypoxia followed by reoxygenation (MHR) on the evolution of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and blood-brain barrier (BBB) integrity in brain endothelial cells (BEC). BBB integrity was assessed in BEC in vitro and in microvessels of the guinea pig whole brain in situ preparation. Probes were exposed to MHR (2 hours 67-70 mmHg O2, 3 hours reoxygenation, BEC) or towards occlusion of the arteria cerebri media (MCAO) with or without subsequent reperfusion in the whole brain preparation. In vitro BBB integrity was evaluated using trans-endothelial electrical resistance (TEER) and transwell permeability assays. ROS in BEC were evaluated using 2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (DCF), MitoSox and immunostaining for nitrotyrosine. Tight-junction protein (TJ) integrity in BEC, stainings for nitrotyrosine and FITC-albumin extravasation in the guinea pig brain preparation were assessed by confocal microscopy. Diphenyleneiodonium (DPI) was used to investigate NADPH oxidase dependent ROS evolution and its effect on BBB parameters in BEC. MHR impaired TJ proteins zonula occludens 1 (ZO-1) and claudin 5 (Cl5), decreased TEER, and significantly increased cytosolic ROS in BEC. These events were blocked by the NADPH oxidase inhibitor DPI. MCAO with or without subsequent reoxygenation resulted in extravasation of FITC-albumin and ROS generation in the penumbra region of the guinea pig brain preparation and confirmed BBB damage. BEC integrity may be impaired through ROS in MHR on the level of TJ and the BBB is also functionally impaired in moderate hypoxic conditions followed by reperfusion in a complex guinea pig brain preparation. These findings suggest that the BBB is susceptible towards MHR and that ROS play a key role in this process."
https://openalex.org/W2049305923,"Aim To characterise changes in pancreatic beta cell mass during the development of diabetes in untreated male C57BLKS/J db/db mice. Methods Blood samples were collected from a total of 72 untreated male db/db mice aged 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 18, 24 and 34 weeks, for measurement of terminal blood glucose, HbA1c, plasma insulin, and C-peptide. Pancreata were removed for quantification of beta cell mass, islet numbers as well as proliferation and apoptosis by immunohistochemistry and stereology. Results Total pancreatic beta cell mass increased significantly from 2.1 ± 0.3 mg in mice aged 5 weeks to a peak value of 4.84 ± 0.26 mg (P < 0.05) in 12-week-old mice, then gradually decreased to 3.27 ± 0.44 mg in mice aged 34 weeks. Analysis of islets in the 5-, 10-, and 24-week age groups showed increased beta cell proliferation in the 10-week-old animals whereas a low proliferation is seen in older animals. The expansion in beta cell mass was driven by an increase in mean islet mass as the total number of islets was unchanged in the three groups. Conclusions/Interpretation The age-dependent beta cell dynamics in male db/db mice has been described from 5-34 weeks of age and at the same time alterations in insulin/glucose homeostasis were assessed. High beta cell proliferation and increased beta cell mass occur in young animals followed by a gradual decline characterised by a low beta cell proliferation in older animals. The expansion of beta cell mass was caused by an increase in mean islet mass and not islet number."
https://openalex.org/W2091859654,"Increasing evidence demonstrates that maternal folic acid (FA) supplementation during pregnancy reduces the risk of neural tube defects, but whether FA prevents preterm delivery and intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) remains obscure. Previous studies showed that maternal lipopolysaccharide (LPS) exposure induces preterm delivery, fetal death and IUGR in rodent animals. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of FA on LPS-induced preterm delivery, fetal death and IUGR in mice. Some pregnant mice were orally administered with FA (0.6, 3 or 15 mg/kg) 1 h before LPS injection. As expected, a high dose of LPS (300 μg/kg, i.p.) on gestational day 15 (GD15) caused 100% of dams to deliver before GD18 and 89.3% of fetuses dead. A low dose of LPS (75 μg/kg, i.p.) daily from GD15 to GD17 resulted in IUGR. Interestingly, pretreatment with FA prevented LPS-induced preterm delivery and fetal death. In addition, FA significantly attenuated LPS-induced IUGR. Further experiments showed that FA inhibited LPS-induced activation of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) in mouse placentas. Moreover, FA suppressed LPS-induced NF-κB activation in human trophoblast cell line JEG-3. Correspondingly, FA significantly attenuated LPS-induced upregulation of cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 in mouse placentas. In addition, FA significantly reduced the levels of interleukin (IL)-6 and keratinocyte-derived cytokine (KC) in amniotic fluid of LPS-treated mice. Collectively, maternal FA supplementation during pregnancy protects against LPS-induced preterm delivery, fetal death and IUGR through its anti-inflammatory effects."

The morphological, physiological and proteomic processes were negatively affected under heat stress. Proteins were extracted and separated by two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (2-DE), and differentially expressed protein spots were identified by mass spectrometry (MS). Totally, 81 differentially expressed proteins were identified successfully by MALDI-TOF/TOF. These proteins were categorized into nine classes: including metabolism, energy, protein synthesis, protein destination/storage, transporters, intracellular traffic, cell structure, signal transduction and disease/defence. Five proteins were further analyzed for mRNA levels. The results of the proteomics analyses provide a better understanding of the molecular basis of heat-stress responses in alfalfa."
https://openalex.org/W2091959028,"Two major classes of B lymphocytes have been described to date in rainbow trout: IgM+ and IgT+ cells. IgM+ cells are mainly localized in the spleen, peripheral blood and kidney but are also found in other tissues. However, differences among IgM+ cell populations attending to its location are poorly defined in fish. Thus, the aim of this work was to characterize the expression of different immune molecules such as chemokine receptors, Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and transcription factors on sorted IgM+ lymphocytes from different rainbow trout tissues. IgM+ populations from blood, spleen, kidney, gills, intestine and liver were isolated by cell sorting and the constitutive levels of transcription of these genes evaluated by real-time PCR. To further characterize B cells, we identified an MS4A sequence. In humans, the MS4A family includes several genes with immune functions, such as the B cell marker CD20 or FcRβ. Subsequently, we have also evaluated the mRNA levels of this MS4A gene in the different IgM+ populations. The relevant differences in transcriptional patterns observed for each of these IgM+ populations analyzed, point to the presence of functionally different tissue-specific B cell populations in rainbow trout. The data shown provides a pattern of genes transcribed in IgM+ B cells not previously revealed in teleost fish. Furthermore, the constitutive expression of all the TLR genes analyzed in IgM+ cells suggests an important role for these cells in innate immunity."
https://openalex.org/W2022313401,"Skeletal muscle wasting attributed to inactivity has significant adverse functional consequences. Accumulating evidence suggests that peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator 1α (PGC-1a) and TNF-like weak inducer of apoptosis (TWEAK)-Fn14 system are key regulators of skeletal muscle mass in various catabolic states. While the activation of TWEAK-Fn14 signaling causes muscle wasting, PGC-1α preserves muscle mass in several conditions, including functional denervation and aging. However, it remains unknown whether there is any regulatory interaction between PGC-1α and TWEAK-Fn14 system during muscle atrophy. Here we demonstrate that TWEAK significantly reduces the levels of PGC-1α and mitochondrial content (~50%) in skeletal muscle. Levels of PGC-1α are significantly increased in skeletal muscle of TWEAK-knockout (KO) and Fn14-KO mice compared to wild-type mice on denervation. Transgenic (Tg) overexpression of PGC-1α inhibited progressive muscle wasting in TWEAK-Tg mice. PGC-1α inhibited the TWEAK-induced activation of NF-κB(~50%) and dramatically reduced (-90%) the expression of atrogenes such as MAFbx and MuRF1. Intriguingly, muscle-specific overexpression of PGC-1α also prevented the inducible expression of Fn14 in denervated skeletal muscle. Collectively, our study demonstrates that TWEAK induces muscle atrophy through repressing the levels of PGC-1a. Overexpression of PGC-1α not only blocks the TWEAK-induced atrophy program but also diminishes the expression of Fn14 in denervated skeletal muscle.—Hindi, S.

https://openalex.org/W2069434184,"Carbamylation is a general process involved in protein molecular ageing due to the nonenzymatic binding of isocyanic acid, mainly generated by urea dissociation, to free amino groups. In vitro experiments and clinical studies have suggested the potential involvement of carbamylated proteins (CPs) in chronic kidney disease (CKD) complications like atherosclerosis, but their metabolic fate in vivo is still unknown. To address this issue, we evaluated protein carbamylation in the plasma and tissues of control and 75% nephrectomised C57BL/6J mice by LC-MS/MS assay of homocitrulline, the major carbamylation-derived product (CDP). A basal level of carbamylation was evidenced under all conditions, showing that carbamylation is a physiological process of protein modification in vivo. CP plasma concentrations increased in nephrectomized vs. control mice over the 20 weeks of the experiment (e.g. 335±43 vs. 167±19 μmol homocitrulline/mol lysine (p<0.001) 20 weeks after nephrectomy). Simultaneously, CP content increased roughly by two-fold in all tissues throughout the experiment. The progressive accumulation of CPs was specifically noted in long-lived extracellular matrix proteins, especially collagen (e.g. 1264±123 vs. 726±99 μmol homocitrulline/mol lysine (p<0.01) in the skin of nephrectomized vs. control mice after 20 weeks of evolution). These results show that chronic increase of urea, as seen in CKD, increases the carbamylation rate of plasma and tissue proteins. These results may be considered in the perspective of the deleterious effects of CPs demonstrated in vitro and of the correlation evidenced recently between plasma CPs and cardiovascular risk or mortality in CKD patients."

https://openalex.org/W2045738772,"Naringin has antioxidant properties that could improve redox-sensitive myocardial ischemia reperfusion (IR) injury. This study was designed to investigate whether naringin restores the myocardial damage and dysfunction in vivo after IR and the mechanisms underlying its cardioprotective effects. Naringin (20–80 mg/kg/day, p.o.) or saline were administered to rats for 14 days and the myocardial IR injury was induced on 15th day by occluding the left anterior descending coronary artery for 45 min and subsequent reperfusion for 60 min. Post-IR rats exhibited pronounced cardiac dysfunction as evidenced by significantly decreased mean arterial pressure, heart rate, +LVdP/dtmax (inotropic state), -LVdP/dtmax (lusitropic state) and increased left ventricular end diastolic pressure as compared to sham group, which was improved by naringin. Further, on histopathological and ultrastructural assessments myocardium and myocytes appeared more normal in structure and the infarct size was reduced significantly in naringin 40 and 80 mg/kg/day group. This amelioration of post-IR-associated cardiac injury by naringin was accompanied by increased nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability, decreased NO inactivation to nitrotyrosine, amplified protein expressions of Hsp27, Hsp70, β-catenin and increased p-eNOS/eNOS, p-Akt/Akt, and p-ERK/ERK ratio. In addition, IR-induced TNF-α/IKK-β/NF-κB upregulation and JNK phosphorylation were significantly attenuated by naringin. Moreover, western blotting and immunohistochemistry analysis of apoptotic signaling pathway further established naringin cardioprotective potential as it upregulated Bcl-2 expression and downregulated Bax and Caspase-3 expression with reduced TUNEL positivity. Naringin also normalized the cardiac injury markers (lactate dehydrogenase and creatine kinase-MB), endogenous antioxidant activities (superoxide dismutase, reduced glutathione and glutathione peroxidase) and lipid peroxidation levels.

https://openalex.org/W2028288407,"Loss of the survival motor neuron gene (SMN1) is responsible for spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), the most common inherited cause of infant mortality. Even though the SMA phenotype is traditionally considered as related to spinal motor neuron loss, it remains debated whether the specific targeting of motor neurons could represent the best therapeutic option for the disease. We here investigated, using stereological quantification methods, the spinal cord and cerebral motor cortex of ∆7 SMA mice during development, to verify extent and selectivity of motor neuron loss. We found progressive post-natal loss of spinal motor neurons, already at pre-symptomatic stages, and a higher vulnerability of motor neurons innervating proximal and axial muscles. Larger motor neurons decreased in the course of disease, either for selective loss or specific developmental impairment. We also found a selective reduction of layer V pyramidal neurons associated with layer V gliosis in the cerebral motor cortex. Our data indicate that in the ∆7 SMA model SMN loss is critical for the spinal cord, particularly for specific motor neuron pools. Neuronal loss, however, is not selective for lower motor neurons. These data further suggest that SMA pathogenesis is likely more complex than previously anticipated.

Bone disease and gastrointestinal disease are two major causes of morbidity and mortality in captive marmosets, but currently no effective antemortem tests are available to identify affected animals prior to the terminal stage of disease. In this study we propose that bone disease and gastrointestinal disease are associated disease entities in marmosets and aim to establish the efficacy of several economical antemortem tests in identifying and predicting disease. Tissues from marmosets were examined to define affected animals and unaffected controls. Complete blood count, serum chemistry values, body weight, quantitative radiographs, and tissue-specific biochemical markers were evaluated as candidate biomarkers for disease. Bone and gastrointestinal disease were associated, with marmosets being over seven times more likely to have either concurrent bone and gastrointestinal disease or neither disease as opposed to lesions in only one organ system. When used in tandem, serum albumin <3.5 g/dL and body weight <325 g identified 100% of the marmosets affected with concurrent bone and gastrointestinal disease. Progressive body weight loss of 0.05% of peak body weight per day predicted which marmosets would develop disease prior to the terminal stage. Bone tissue-specific tests, such as quantitative analysis of radiographs and serum parathyroid hormone levels, were effective for distinguishing between marmosets with bone disease and those without. These results provide an avenue for making informed decisions regarding the removal of affected marmosets from studies in a timely manner, preserving the integrity of research results."
https://openalex.org/W2010370979,"Nutritional factors play important roles in the etiology of obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus and their complications through genotype x environment interactions. We have characterised molecular adaptation to high fat diet (HFD) feeding in inbred mouse strains widely used in genetic and physiological studies. We carried out physiological tests, plasma lipid assays, obesity measures, liver histology, hepatic lipid measurements and liver genome-wide gene transcription profiling in C57BL/6J and BALB/c mice fed either a control or a high fat diet. The two strains showed marked susceptibility (C57BL/6J) and relative resistance (BALB/c) to HFD-induced insulin resistance and non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Global gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) of transcriptome data identified consistent patterns of expression of key genes (Srebf1, Stard4, Pnpla2, Ccnd1) and molecular pathways in the two strains, which may underlie homeostatic adaptations to dietary fat. Differential regulation of pathways, including the proteasome, the ubiquitin mediated proteolysis and PPAR signalling in fat fed C57BL/6J and BALB/c suggests that altered expression of underlying diet-responsive genes may be involved in contrasting nutrigenomic predisposition and resistance to insulin resistance and NAFLD in these models. Collectively, these data, which further demonstrate the impact of gene x environment interactions on gene expression regulations, contribute to improved knowledge of natural and pathogenic adaptive genomic regulations and molecular mechanisms associated with genetically determined susceptibility and resistance to metabolic diseases."
https://openalex.org/W1995051516,"Purpose This study was aimed to experimentally and numerically investigate the feasibility of measuring cerebral white matter perfusion using pseudocontinuous arterial spin labeling (PCASL) 3T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at a relatively fine resolution to mitigate partial volume effect from gray matter. Materials and Methods The Institutional Research Ethics Committee approved this study. On a clinical 3T MR system, ten healthy volunteers (5 females, 5 males, age = 28±3 years) were scanned after providing written informed consent. PCASL imaging was performed with varied combinations of labeling duration (τ = 1000, 1500, 2000, and 2500 ms) and post-labeling delay (PLD = 1000, 1400, 1800, and 2200 ms), at a spatial resolution (1.56x1.56x5 mm3) finer than commonly used (3.5x3.5 mm2, 5-8 mm in thickness). Computer simulations were performed to calculate the achievable perfusion-weighted signal-to-noise ratio at varied τ, PLD, and transit delay. Results Based on experimental and numerical data, the optimal τ and PLD were found to be 2000 ms and 1500-1800 ms, respectively, yielding adequate SNR (~2) to support perfusion measurement in the majority (~60%) of white matter. The measurement variability was about 9% in a one-week interval. The measured white matter perfusion and perfusion ratio of gray matter to white matter were 15.8-27.5 ml/100ml/min and 1.8-4.0, respectively, depending on spatial resolution as well as the amount of deep white matter included. Conclusion PCASL 3T MRI is able to measure perfusion in the majority of cerebral white matter at an adequate signal-to-noise ratio by using appropriate tagging duration and post-labeling delay. Although pixel-wise comparison may not be possible, region-of-interest based flow quantification is feasible."

Hsp90 has been shown to bind PP5 to activate its phosphatase activity. However, the functional implications of binding Hsp70 to PP5 are not yet clear. In this study, we find that both Hsp90 and Hsp70 bind to PP5 using a luciferase fragment complementation assay. A fluorescence polarization assay shows that Hsp90 (MEEVD motif) binds to the TPR domain of PP5 almost 3-fold higher affinity than Hsp70 (IEEVD motif). However, Hsp70 binding to PP5 stimulates higher phosphatase activity of PP5 than the binding of Hsp90. We find that PP5 forms a stable 1:1 complex with Hsp70, but the interaction appears asymmetric with Hsp90, with one PP5 binding the dimer. Solution NMR studies reveal that Hsc70 and PP5 proteins are dynamically independent in complex, tethered by a disordered region that connects the Hsc70 core and the IEEVD-TPR contact area. This tethered binding is expected to allow PP5 to carry out multi-site dephosphorylation of Hsp70-bound clients with a range of sizes and shapes. Together, these results demonstrate that Hsp70 recruits PP5 and activates its phosphatase activity which suggests dual roles for PP5 that might link chaperone systems with signaling pathways in cancer and development.

Biol. 2005; 346: 717-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Although biochemical data illustrates that an MEEVD peptide has high affinity for the TPR domain of PP5 (∼50 nm), solution phase NMR studies revealed that this interaction is highly dynamic with only few enduring contacts (19Cliff M.J.

Co-immunoprecipitation studies suggest that PP5 binds Hsp70 (21Zeke T. Morrice N. Vázquez-Martin C. Cohen P.T. Human protein phosphatase 5 dissociates from heat-shock proteins and is proteolytically activated in response to arachidonic acid and the microtubule-depolymerizing drug nocodazole.Biochem. J. 2005; 385: 45-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), but it is not yet clear how PP5 interacts with this chaperone or whether the TPR domain is involved. Based on the Hsp90-PP5 complex, it is likely that this interaction occurs through the IEEVD motif at the C termini of the cytoplasmic Hsp70 family members, including heat shock cognate 70 (Hsc70; HSPA8) and heat shock protein 72 (Hsp72; HSPA1A). protein phosphatase 5 tetratricopeptide repeat C-terminal Renilla luciferase N-terminal Renilla luciferase size exclusion chromatography and multi-angle light scattering signal-to-noise ratio nucleotide-binding domain substrate-binding domain split Renilla luciferase protein fragment-assisted complementation. PP5 belongs to a family of TPR domain-containing co-chaperones that includes Hop (Hsp70/90 organizing protein), CHIP (carboxyl terminus of Hsp70 interacting protein) and a number of immunophilins such as FKBP52 (FK506 binding protein 52 kDa). Members of this co-chaperone family bind to Hsp70 and/or Hsp90 at these chaperones' C-terminal EEVD motifs. In turn, the TPR co-chaperones are important regulators of chaperone function (16Scheufler C. Brinker A. Bourenkov G. Pegoraro S. Moroder L. Bartunik H. Hartl F.U. Moarefi I.

Hsp70 chaperones: Cellular functions and molecular mechanism.Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2005; 62: 670-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (2065) Google Scholar). For example, complexes between CHIP and either Hsp70 or Hsp90 are linked to the ubiquitination and therefore the proteasomal degradation of chaperone-bound clients. Likewise, a complex between these chaperones and HOP is critical to the folding of some clients such as nuclear hormone receptors (24Connell P. Ballinger C.A. Jiang J. Wu Y. Thompson L.J. Höhfeld J.

Chem. 1998; 273: 35194-35200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). Additionally, FKBP52 couples clients of Hsp70 and Hsp90 to the cytoskeleton (27Heinlein C.A. Chang C. Role of chaperones in nuclear translocation and transactivation of steroid receptors.Endocrine. 2001; 14: 143-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). However, less is known about the Hsp70-PP5 and Hsp90-PP5 complexes and their potential roles in the protein homeostasis network. One important clue comes from observations that the TPR domain and the C-terminal catalytic subunit of PP5 have an auto-inhibitory function, suppressing phosphatase activity. Indeed, binding of Hsp90 to the TPR domain has been reported to weakly activate PP5 (14Yang J. Roe S.M. Cliff M.J. Williams M.A. Ladbury J.E. Cohen P.T. Barford D. Molecular basis for TPR domain-mediated regulation of protein phosphatase.EMBO J. 2005; 24: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). However, it is not yet clear whether Hsp70 also binds the TPR domain or whether this interaction activates PP5. Toward these questions, we characterized the interaction of Hsp70 and Hsp90 with PP5, using a panel of cell-based assays and biophysical methods. These studies confirmed that PP5 binds Hsp70 and Hsp90 through the canonical EEVD motifs. However, we found that C-terminal peptides derived from Hsp90α/β bind to PP5 10-fold tighter than C-terminal peptides derived from Hsc70/Hsp72. Despite the weaker affinity of Hsp70 for PP5, this chaperone was far more effective at stimulating the phosphatase activity of PP5. Additionally, solution phase NMR studies showed that Hsp70 and PP5 move independently of each other in the bound complex, suggesting that the disordered C terminus of Hsp70 allows the activated PP5 to “sample” a relatively large area around the chaperone. This ultra-structure might be important in allowing PP5 to act on a wide range of chaperone clients. Together, these results suggest that the Hsp70-PP5 complex is a potent phosphatase that might link chaperone systems with signaling pathways in cancer and development. Reagents were obtained from the following sources: pLentilox vectors (University of Michigan Vector Core); pMSCG9 vector (Clay Brown, Center for Structural Biology, University of Michigan); restriction endonucleases (New England Biolabs); HEK293 (American Type Culture Collection); Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen, 11965-092); fetal bovine serum (10082-147); antibiotic-antimycotic (Invitrogen, 15240–062); six-well tissue culture plate (BD Falcon, 3046); polybrene linker (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-134220) Renilla GLO luciferase kit (Promega, Madison, WI); and p-nitrophenyl phosphate phosphatase substrate kit (Thermo Scientific, 37620). C-terminal Renilla luciferase (CRL, residues 1–229) and full-length Hsp70 or Hsp90 (upstream of CRL) were PCR-amplified and subcloned into a pLentilox RSV-2 dsRed vector using the following restriction site design: BamHI-Hsp72-Xba1-CRL-Not1 and Xma1-HSP90α-BamHI-CRL-Xba1. In these fusion constructs, the stop codon of Hsp70/90 was deleted. Similarly, N-terminal Renilla luciferase (NRL, resides 230–311) and full-length PP5 (downstream of NRL) were amplified and subcloned into the pLentilox RSV vector using the following restriction site design: BamHI-NRL-Xba1-PP5-Not1. In this construct, the NRL stop codon was deleted. All fusion constructs (Hsp70/90-CRL and NRL-PP5) contained a GGGGSGGGGS (G4S)2 peptide linker between the protein of interest and the Renilla luciferase reporter (28Paulmurugan R. Massoud T.F. Huang J. Gambhir S.S. Molecular imaging of drug-modulated protein-protein interactions in living subjects.Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 2113-2119Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). After all sequences were confirmed at the University of Michigan DNA sequencing core, lentiviral particles containing these constructs were purchased (University of Michigan Vector Core) to create a stable cell lines for additional studies. HEK293 cells were plated using DMEM (Invitrogen) with 10% FBS and no antibiotics into a six-well tissue culture plate. Cells were allowed to adhere and grow for 1 day (∼70% confluent) before transduction. The next day, fresh media without antibiotics (1.35 ml), 0.15 ml of 10× lentiviral particles (either Hsp70-CRL, Hsp90-CRL, or NRL-PP5), and polybrene linker to a final concentration of 8 μg/ml was added to each well. After an incubation period of 8 h at 37 °C and 5% CO2, the medium was replaced with DMEM with 10% FBS and 1% antibiotic-antimycotic. For cells that contained both HSP70/90-CRL and NRL-PP5 viral particles, the above procedure first performed with Hsp90/Hsp70-CRL viral particles. Using these cells, the same procedure was repeated a second time; however, NRL-PP5 lentiviral particle was added. The HSP70/90-CRL and PP5-NRL viral particles contained dsRED and GFP, respectively. Cells containing Hsp90-CRL, Hsp70-CRL, NRL-PP5, Hsp90-CRL + NRL-PP5, and Hsp70-CRL + NRL-PP5 constructs were then seeded into a 24-well plate at a density of 5,000 cell/wells and allowed to grow overnight at 37 °C and 5% CO2. The following day, the medium was removed, and the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline. Luciferase activity determined using the Renilla-GLO luciferase assay system kit. Briefly, following washing, 100 μl of 1× passive lysis buffer was added to each well and plates were allowed to shake for 15 min at room temperature. Afterward, 1× luciferase substrate was added, and the luminescence was measured using Biotek Synergy 2 plate reader. Full-length PP5 and Hsp90 were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) cells from pMCSG9 plasmids. A fresh colony was grown in terrific broth medium supplemented with 50 mg/liter ampicillin at 37 °C with shaking at 250 rpm until A600 reached ∼0.8 and protein expression was induced by the addition of isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (final concentration of 1 mm). The temperature was reduced to 18 °C, and the culture was allowed to shake overnight. Cells were harvested by centrifugation (4000 × g, 10 min, 4 °C). Cell pellets was suspended in lysis buffer (50 mm NaH2PO4, 300 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole (pH 8.0)) and sonicated on ice, and clarified by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 30 min. The His-tagged proteins were purified using a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (Qiagen) column. The eluted protein was subjected to dialysis (PP5 buffer, 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10% glycerol, 1 mm DTT, and HSP90 buffer, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 20 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mm DTT). Proteins were treated with His-tagged tobacco etch virus protease TEV protease (1 μm) overnight at 4 °C to remove tags. This process was repeated a second time prior to extensive dialysis and removal of any residual His-tagged protein by nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column. Human Hsp70s (pMCSG7 vector) were expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) cells using terrific broth medium supplemented with 50 mg/liter ampicillin at 37 °C with shaking at 250 rpm until A600 of ∼0.8 was reached. Additionally, Hsc70 protein was isotopically labeled for all NMR experiments. For labeled Hsc70, the BL21 cells were grown M9 media with15NH4Cl (Sigma Aldrich). The temperature was reduced to 18 °C, and the culture was allowed to shake overnight. Cells were harvested by centrifugation (4000 × g, 10 min, 4 °C). All Hsp70s were purified as described (29Chang L. Thompson A.D. Ung P. Carlson H.A. Gestwicki J.E.

All protein concentrations were measure using the Pierce BCA protein assay kit according to the manufacturer's protocol. To verify Hsc70 was not aggregated, the raw fluorescence values of the parallel and perpendicular intensity using fluorescence polarization shows no indication of aggregation. In addition, non-binding and binding tracer in fluorescence polarization was also used to confirm Hsc70 was not aggregated. NMR structure showed no sign of Hsc70 aggregation. All peptides were synthesized manually or with an ABI 433 peptide synthesizer using Fmoc chemistry with 2-chlorotrityl resin as the solid support. Either DIC/HOAt or HOBt/HBTU was used as the coupling reagent. Following completion of the peptide, a cleavage mixture composed of TFA/triisopropylsilane/H2O (19 ml:0.5 ml:0.5 ml) removed the peptide from the resin as well as any side chain protecting groups. The resulting solution was evaporated, and the crude peptide was precipitated with diethyl ether. Peptides were purified via RP-HPLC (Waters, Sunfire Prep C18, 19 mm × 150 mm, 5 μm) and confirmed by electrospray ionization mass spectroscopy (30Amblard M. Fehrentz J.A. Martinez J. Subra G. Methods and protocols of modern solid phase peptide synthesis.Mol. Biotechnol. 2006; 33: 239-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). All fluorescence polarization experiments were conducted in 384-well, black, low volume, round-bottomed plates (Corning) using a BioTeck Synergy 2 plate reader (Winooski, VT). For binding experiments, to each well was added increasing amounts of protein and the 5-carboxyfluorescein-labeled Hsp70/90 C-terminal probe/tracer (20 nm). For competition studies, each well had PP5 protein at a concentration equivalent to the Kd, 5-carboxyfluorescein-labeled peptide was held constant at 20 nm, and varying concentrations of unlabeled peptide was added to compete off labeled peptide. All wells had a final volume of 20 μl in the assay buffer (40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10% glycerol, 1 mm DTT). The plate was allowed to incubate at room temperature for 5 min to reach equilibrium. The polarization values in millipolarization units were measured at an excitation wavelength at 485 nm and an emission wavelength at 528 nm. An equilibrium binding isotherm was constructed by plotting the fluorescence polarization reading as a function of the protein concentration at a fixed concentration of tracer (20 nm). All experimental data were analyzed using Prism software (version 5.0, Graphpad Software, San Diego, CA) and WinNonlin (version 5.3). NMR data were collected using an Agilent/Varian NMR System with a room temperature triple resonance probe, interfaced to an Oxford instruments 18.7 tesla magnet (1H 800 MHz). Backbone assignments for the C terminus of Hsc70 were reported previously (38Smith M.C. Scaglione K.M. Assimon V.A. Patury S. Thompson A.D. Dickey C.A. Southworth D.R. Paulson H.L. Gestwicki J.E.

Experiments for studying the interaction of PP5 with Hsc70 were carried out using full-length PP5 and full-length 15N-labeled Hsc70 in the following buffer: 50 mm HEPES, 75 mm NaCl, 1 mm ADP, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.02% NaN3, 0.01% Triton, pH 7.4, 30 °C. The TROSY spectrum with 1:0 Hsc70/PP5 was recorded in 10 h with a sample of 254 μm Hsc70. The spectrum with 1:1 Hsc70/PP5 was recorded in 22 h with a sample of 169 μm Hsc70 and 149 μm PP5. The two spectra have the same intrinsic signal to noise ratio ((254/169)2 = 2.25). PP5-Hsp70 and PP5-Hsp90 complexes were formed by incubating proteins at equal molar concentrations (10 μm) in binding buffer (100 mm KCl, 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 7 mm β-mercaptoethanol) at room temperature for 30 min. Identification and molecular weight determination of complexes was achieved through SEC (Wyatt WTC-050S5 and WTC-030S5 columns) with an Akta micro FPLC (GE Healthcare) and in-line DAWN HELEOS MALS and Optilab rEX differential refractive index detectors (Wyatt Technology Corp.). SEC was performed in 100 mm KCl, 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.5). Data were analyzed by the ASTRA software package (version 6, Wyatt Technology Corp.). The two spectra have the same intrinsic signal to noise ratio ((254/169)2 = 2.25). Purified PP5, Hsp70, and Hsp90 were immobilized in 4HBX 96-well plates (Thermo Scientific) and diluted with ELISA buffer (BioLegend). Equal molar concentration of protein was added to each well, and the plate was incubated overnight at 4 °C. Protein concentrations ranged from 50 to 0.5 μm. The following day, p-nitrophenyl phosphate (Fisher Scientific) was used according to the manufacturer's instructions. Once p-nitrophenyl phosphate substrates were added to the plates, they were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. After color change, the OD405 was measured on the Biomatrix Plate Reader Synergy 2. The enzymatic activity was calculated using the following equation, Enzyme activityμmolminμg=volume×OD405path lengthεϵenzyme×time of incubation(Eq. 1) where ϵ is the molar extinction coefficient, which equals 1.78 × 104 m−1 × cm−1. Previous co-immunoprecipitation studies have suggested that PP5 interacts with both Hsp70 and Hsp90 in cells (21Zeke T. Morrice N. Vázquez-Martin C. Cohen P.T. Human protein phosphatase 5 dissociates from heat-shock proteins and is proteolytically activated in response to arachidonic acid and the microtubule-depolymerizing drug nocodazole.Biochem. J. 2005; 385: 45-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). To confirm this result, we utilized the SRL-PFAC system, which has proven to be a powerful method for studying protein-protein interactions in cells (31Jiang Y. Bernard D. Yu Y. Xie Y. Zhang T. Li Y. Burnett J.P. Fu X. Wang S. Sun D. Split Renilla luciferase protein fragment-assisted complementation (SRL-PFAC) to characterize Hsp90-Cdc37 complex and identify critical residues in protein/protein interactions.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 21023-21036Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In this assay, the full-length Renilla luciferase gene is divided into inactive halves, the NRL (residues 1–229) and the CRL (residues 230–311). The NRL and CRL will reconstitute functional luciferase if they are brought into close proximity. To explore whether Hsp90 and Hsp70 bind PP5, we created constructs that would express NRL-PP5, Hsp70-CRL, or Hsp90-CRL fusion proteins (Fig. 1A). We anticipated that a luminescence signal would be detected only if Hsp90 or Hsp70 interacts with PP5 (Fig. 1B). When HEK293 cells were transduced with viral vectors expressing either NRL-PP5, Hsp70-CRL, or Hsp90-CRL alone, low luciferase activity was measured (Fig. 1C). However, co-transduction with either the NRL-PP5+Hsp70-CRL pair or the NRL-PP5+Hsp90-CRL pair led to enhanced luciferase activity (Fig. 1C), consistent with the interaction of PP5 with both chaperones in cells. We also examined at a control pair (NRL-PP5+HOP-CRL) if nonspecific complementation would occur."
https://openalex.org/W2097682531,"The gram-negative opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa is the primary cause of chronic respiratory infections in individuals with the heritable disease cystic fibrosis (CF). These infections can last for decades, during which time P. aeruginosa has been proposed to acquire beneficial traits via adaptive evolution. Because CF lacks an animal model that can acquire chronic P. aeruginosa infections, identifying genes important for long-term in vivo fitness remains difficult. However, since clonal, chronological samples can be obtained from chronically infected individuals, traits undergoing adaptive evolution can be identified. Recently we identified 24 P. aeruginosa gene expression traits undergoing parallel evolution in vivo in multiple individuals, suggesting they are beneficial to the bacterium. The goal of this study was to determine if these genes impact P. aeruginosa phenotypes important for survival in the CF lung. By using a gain-of-function genetic screen, we found that 4 genes and 2 operons undergoing parallel evolution in vivo promote P. aeruginosa biofilm formation. These genes/operons promote biofilm formation by increasing levels of the non-alginate exopolysaccharide Psl. One of these genes, phaF, enhances Psl production via a post-transcriptional mechanism, while the other 5 genes/operons do not act on either psl transcription or translation. Together, these data demonstrate that P. aeruginosa has evolved at least two pathways to over-produce a non-alginate exopolysaccharide during long-term colonization of the CF lung. More broadly, this approach allowed us to attribute a biological significance to genes with unknown function, demonstrating the power of using evolution as a guide for targeted genetic studies."
https://openalex.org/W2109802152,"In humans, the Crumbs homologue-1 (CRB1) gene is mutated in progressive types of autosomal recessive retinitis pigmentosa and Leber congenital amaurosis. The severity of the phenotype due to human CRB1 or mouse Crb1 mutations is dependent on the genetic background. Mice on C57BL/6J background with Crb1 mutations show late onset of retinal spotting phenotype or no phenotype. Recently, we showed that conditional deletion of mouse Crb2 in the retina results in early retinal disorganization leading to severe and progressive retinal degeneration with concomitant visual loss that mimics retinitis pigmentosa due to mutations in the CRB1 gene. Recent studies in the fruit fly and zebrafish suggest roles of the Crumbs (CRB) complex members in the regulation of cellular signalling pathways including the Notch1, mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) and the Hippo pathway. Here, we demonstrate that mice backcrossed to C57BL/6J background with loss of CRB2 in the retina show a progressive disorganization and degeneration phenotype during late retinal development. We used microarray gene profiling to study the transcriptome of retinas lacking CRB2 during late retinal development. Unexpectedly, the retinas of newborn mice lacking CRB2 showed no changes in the transcriptome during retinal development. These findings suggest that loss of CRB2 in the developing retina results in retinal disorganization and subsequent degeneration without major changes in the transcriptome of the retina. These mice might be an interesting model to study the onset of retinal degeneration upon loss of CRB proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2024107382,"Exercise intolerance in COPD seems to combine abnormal ventilatory mechanics, impaired O2 transport and skeletal muscle dysfunction. However their relative contribution and their influence on symptoms reported by patients remain to be clarified. In order to clarify the complex interaction between ventilatory and neuromuscular exercise limiting factors and symptoms, we evaluated respiratory muscles and quadriceps contractile fatigue, dynamic hyperinflation and symptoms induced by exhaustive high-intensity cycling in COPD patients. Fifteen gold II-III COPD patients (age = 67 ± 6 yr; BMI = 26.6 ± 4.2 kg.m(-2)) performed constant-load cycling test at 80% of their peak workload until exhaustion (9.3 ± 2.4 min). Before exercise and at exhaustion, potentiated twitch quadriceps strength (Q(tw)), transdiaphragmatic (P(di,tw)) and gastric (P(ga,tw)) pressures were evoked by femoral nerve, cervical and thoracic magnetic stimulation, respectively. Changes in operational lung volumes during exercise were assessed via repetitive inspiratory capacity (IC) measurements. Dyspnoea and leg discomfort were measured on visual analog scale. At exhaustion, Q(tw) (-33 ± 15%, >15% reduction observed in all patients but two) and Pdi,tw (-20 ± 15%, >15% reduction in 6 patients) were significantly reduced (P<0.05) but not Pga,tw (-6 ± 10%, >15% reduction in 3 patients). Percentage reduction in Q(tw) correlated with the percentage reduction in P(di,tw) (r = 0.66; P<0.05). Percentage reductions in P(di,tw) and P(ga,tw) negatively correlated with the reduction in IC at exhaustion (r = -0.56 and r = -0.62, respectively; P<0.05). Neither dyspnea nor leg discomfort correlated with the amount of muscle fatigue. In conclusion, high-intensity exercise induces quadriceps, diaphragm and less frequently abdominal contractile fatigue in this group of COPD patients. In addition, the rise in end-expiratory lung volume and diaphragm flattening associated with dynamic hyperinflation in COPD might limit the development of abdominal and diaphragm muscle fatigue. This study underlines that both respiratory and quadriceps fatigue should be considered to understand the complex interplay of factors leading to exercise intolerance in COPD patients."
https://openalex.org/W1993933755,"Huwentoxin-IV (HwTx-IV) is a 35-residue neurotoxin peptide with potential application as a novel analgesic. It is a member of the inhibitory cystine knot (ICK) peptide family, characterised by a compact globular structure maintained by three intramolecular disulfide bonds. Here we describe a novel strategy for producing non-tagged, fully folded ICK-toxin in a bacterial system. HwTx-IV was expressed as a cleavable fusion to small ubiquitin-related modifier (SUMO) in the cytoplasm of the SHuffle T7 Express lysY Escherichia coli strain, which allows cytosolic disulfide bond formation. Purification by IMAC with selective elution of monomeric SUMO fusion followed by proteolytic cleavage and polishing chromatographic steps yielded pure homogeneous toxin. Recombinant HwTx-IV is produced with a C-terminal acid, whereas the native peptide is C-terminally amidated. HwTx-IV(acid) inhibited Nav1.7 in a dose dependent manner (IC50 = 463-727 nM). In comparison to HwTx-IV(amide) (IC50 = 11 ± 3 nM), the carboxylate was ~50 fold less potent on Nav1.7, which highlights the impact of the C-terminus. As the amide bond of an additional amino acid may mimic the carboxamide, we expressed the glycine-extended analogue HwTx-IVG36(acid) in the SUMO/SHuffle system. The peptide was approximately three fold more potent on Nav1.7 in comparison to HwTx-IV(acid) (IC50 = 190 nM). In conclusion, we have established a novel system for expression and purification of fully folded and active HwTx-IV(acid) in bacteria, which could be applicable to other structurally complex and cysteine rich peptides. Furthermore, we discovered that glycine extension of HwTx-IV(acid) restores some of the potency of the native carboxamide. This finding may also apply to other C-terminally amidated peptides produced recombinantly."
https://openalex.org/W2063929049,"A dissociation between visual awareness and visual discrimination is referred to as “blindsight”. Blindsight results from loss of function of the primary visual cortex (V1) which can occur due to cerebrovascular accidents (i.e. stroke-related lesions). There are also numerous reports of similar, though reversible, effects on vision induced by transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) to early visual cortex. These effects point to V1 as the “gate” of visual awareness and have strong implications for understanding the neurological underpinnings of consciousness. It has been argued that evidence for the dissociation between awareness of, and responses to, visual stimuli can be a measurement artifact of the use of a high response criterion under yes-no measures of visual awareness when compared with the criterion free forced-choice responses. This difference between yes-no and forced-choice measures suggests that evidence for a dissociation may actually be normal near-threshold conscious vision. Here we describe three experiments that tested visual performance in normal subjects when their visual awareness was suppressed by applying TMS to the occipital pole. The nature of subjects’ performance whilst undergoing occipital TMS was then verified by use of a psychophysical measure (d') that is independent of response criteria. This showed that there was no genuine dissociation in visual sensitivity measured by yes-no and forced-choice responses. These results highlight that evidence for visual sensitivity in the absence of awareness must be analysed using a bias-free psychophysical measure, such as d', In order to confirm whether or not visual performance is truly unconscious."
https://openalex.org/W1968374384,"Ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM) is a Ser/Thr protein kinase that plays a critical role in DNA damage-induced signaling and initiation of cell cycle checkpoint signaling in response to DNA-damaging agents such as ionizing radiation. We have previously reported the ATM protein loss by immunohistochemistry (IHC) in 16% of human gastric cancer (GC) tissue. We hypothesized that ATM gene intron mutations targeted by microsatellite instability (MSI) cause ATM protein loss in a subset of GC. We studied mononucleotide mutations at the intron of ATM gene, ATM IHC and MSI in GC. Ten human gastric cancer cell lines were studied for the ATM gene mutation at introns, RT-PCR, direct sequencing, and immunohistochemistry. GC tissues of 839 patients were analyzed for MSI and ATM IHC. Among them, 604 cases were analyzed for the ATM mutations at introns preceding exon 6, exon 10 and exon 20. Two human GC cell lines (SNU-1 and -638) showed ATM intron mutations, deletion in RT-PCR and direct sequencing, and ATM protein loss by IHC. The frequencies of ATM mutation, MSI, and ATM protein loss were 12.9% (78/604), 9.2% (81/882) and 15.2% (134/839), respectively. Analysis of associations among MSI, ATM gene mutation, and ATM protein loss revealed highly co-existing ATM gene alterations and MSI. ATM intron mutation and ATM protein loss were detected in 69.3% (52/75) and 53.3% (40/75) of MSI positive GC. MSI positivity and ATM protein loss were present in 68.4% (52/76) and 48.7% (37/76) of GC with ATM intron mutation. ATM mutation and ATM protein loss had characteristics of old age, distal location of tumor, large tumor size, and histologic intestinal type. Our study might be interpreted as that ATM gene mutation at intron might be targeted by MSI and lead to ATM protein loss in a selected group of GC."
https://openalex.org/W1970786645,"During the past decade, the dual function of the immune system in tumor inhibition and tumor progression has become appreciated. We have previously reported that neu-specific T cells can induce rejection of neu positive mouse mammary carcinoma (MMC) and also facilitate tumor relapse by inducing neu antigen loss and epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT). Here, we sought to determine the mechanism by which CD8+ T cells either eliminate the tumor, or maintain tumor cells in a dormant state and eventually facilitate tumor relapse. We show that tumor cells that express high levels of IFN-γ Rα are eliminated by CD8+ T cells. In contrast, tumor cells that express low levels of IFN-γ Rα do not die but remain dormant and quiescent in the presence of IFN-γ producing CD8+ T cells until they hide themselves from the adaptive immune system by losing the tumor antigen, neu. Relapsed tumor cells show CD44+CD24- phenotype with higher rates of tumorigenesis, in vivo. Acquisition of CD44+CD24- phenotype in relapsed tumors was not solely due to Darwinian selection. Our data suggest that tumor cells control the outcome of tumor immune surveillance through modulation of the expression of IFN-γ Rα."
https://openalex.org/W2074591170,"Although the etiology of Crohn's disease (CD) remains elusive this disease is characterized by T cell activation that leads to chronic inflammation and mucosal damage. A potential role for maladaptation between the intestinal microbiota and the mucosal immune response is suggested by the fact that mutations in the pattern recognition receptor Nod2 are associated with higher risks for developing CD. Although Nod2 deletion in CD4+ T cells has been shown to impair the induction of colitis in the murine T cell transfer model, the analysis of T cell intrinsic Nod2 function in T cell differentiation and T cell-mediated immunity is inconsistent between several studies. In addition, the role of T cell intrinsic Nod2 in regulatory T cell (Treg) development and function during colitis remain to be analyzed. In this study, we show that Nod2 expression is higher in activated/memory CD4+ T cells and its expression was inducible after T cell receptor (TCR) ligation. Nod2 stimulation with muramyl dipeptide (MDP) led to a nuclear accumulation of c-Rel NF-kB subunit. Although functionally active in CD4+ T cells, the deletion of Nod2 did not impair the induction and the prevention of colitis in the T cell transfer model. Moreover, Nod2 deletion did not affect the development of Foxp3+ Treg cells in the spleen of recipient mice and Nod2 deficient CD4 T cells expressing the OVA specific transgenic TCR were able to differentiate in Foxp3+ Treg cells after OVA feeding. In vitro, CD25+ Nod2 deficient T cells suppressed T cell proliferation as well as wild type counter parts and T cell stimulation with MDP did not affect the proliferation and the cytokine secretion of T cells. In conclusion, our data indicate that Nod2 is functional in murine CD4+ T cells but its expression is dispensable for the T cell regulation of colitis."
https://openalex.org/W2162847672,"A dispersed particle gel (DPG) was successfully prepared from a polymer gel at room temperature. The polymer gel system, morphology, viscosity changes, size distribution, and zeta potential of DPG particles were investigated. The results showed that zirconium gel systems with different strengths can be cross-linked within 2.5 h at low temperature. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and atomic force microscopy (AFM) results showed that the particles were polygonal particles with nano-size distribution. According to the viscosity changes, the whole preparation process can be divided into two major stages: the bulk gel cross-linking reaction period and the DPG particle preparation period. A polymer gel with a 3-dimensional network was formed in the bulk gel cross-linking reaction period whereas shearing force and frictional force were the main driving forces for the preparation of DPG particles, and thus affected the morphology of DPG particles. High shearing force and frictional force reduced the particle size distribution, and then decreased the zeta potential (absolute value). The whole preparation process could be completed within 3 h at room temperature. It could be an efficient and energy-saving technology for preparation of DPG particles."
https://openalex.org/W1986590691,"We explore the influence of spatial grain size, dispersal ability, and geographic distance on the patterns of species dissimilarity of terrestrial vertebrates, separating the dissimilarity explained by species replacement (turnover) from that resulting from richness differences. With data for 905 species of terrestrial vertebrates distributed in the Isthmus of Tehuantepec, classified into five groups according to their taxonomy and dispersal ability, we calculated total dissimilarity and its additive partitioning as two components: dissimilarity derived from turnover and dissimilarity derived from richness differences. These indices were compared using fine (10 x 10 km), intermediate (20 x 20 km) and coarse (40 x 40 km) grain grids, and were tested for any correlations with geographic distance. The results showed that total dissimilarity is high for the terrestrial vertebrates in this region. Total dissimilarity, and dissimilarity due to turnover are correlated with geographic distance, and the patterns are clearer when the grain is fine, which is consistent with the distance-decay pattern of similarity. For all terrestrial vertebrates tested on the Isthmus of Tehuantepec both the dissimilarity derived from turnover and the dissimilarity resulting from richness differences make important contributions to total dissimilarity, and dispersal ability does not seem to influence the dissimilarity patterns. These findings support the idea that conservation efforts in this region require a system of interconnected protected areas that embrace the environmental, climatic and biogeographic heterogeneity of the area."
https://openalex.org/W2095565924,"Autosomal recessive intellectual disability (ID) is characterized by extensive genetic heterogeneity. Recently, three mutations in SZT2 were reported in two unrelated children with unexplained infantile epileptic encephalopathy with severe ID. Here we report a European American family with three children having non-syndromic mild or moderate ID without seizures. Whole-exome sequencing of three affected siblings revealed a three base pair deletion (c.4202_4204delTTC) located in a 19 mb autozygous region on chromosome 1, leading to an amino acid deletion (p.Phe1401del) in SZT2. All three children were homozygous for the deletion and their parents were heterozygous as expected in autosomal recessive inheritance. SZT2 is highly expressed in neuronal tissues and regulates seizure threshold and neuronal excitation in mice. We conclude that the disruption of SZT2 with some residual function might lead to mild or moderate ID without seizures."

The molecular determinants of influenza severity, often exacerbated by secondary bacterial infection, are largely unclear. We generated a novel outbred mouse model of influenza virus, Staphylococcus aureus, and co-infection utilizing influenza A/CA/07/2009 virus and S. aureus (USA300). Outbred mice displayed a wide range of pathologic phenotypes following influenza virus or co-infection ranging broadly in severity. Influenza viral burden positively correlated with weight loss although lung histopathology did not. Inflammatory cytokines including IL-6, TNF-α, G-CSF, and CXCL10 positively correlated with both weight loss and viral burden. In S. aureus infection, IL-1β, G-CSF, TNF-α, and IL-6 positively correlated with weight loss and bacterial burden. In co-infection, IL-1β production correlated with decreased weight loss suggesting a protective role. The data demonstrate an approach to identify biomarkers of severe disease and to understand pathogenic mechanisms in pneumonia."
https://openalex.org/W2017629925,"Maternally inherited Wolbachia (α-Proteobacteria) are widespread parasitic reproductive manipulators. A growing number of studies have described the presence of different Wolbachia strains within a same host. To date, no naturally occurring multiple infections have been recorded in terrestrial isopods. This is true for Armadillidium vulgare which is known to harbor non simultaneously three Wolbachia strains. Traditionally, such Wolbachia are detected by PCR amplification of the wsp gene and strains are characterized by sequencing. The presence of nucleotide deletions or insertions within the wsp gene, among these three different strains, provides the opportunity to test a novel genotyping method. Herein, we designed a new primer pair able to amplify products whose lengths are specific to each Wolbachia strain so as to detect the presence of multi-infections in A. vulgare. Experimental injections of Wolbachia strains in Wolbachia-free females were used to validate the methodology. We re-investigated, using this novel method, the infection status of 40 females sampled in 2003 and previously described as mono-infected based on the classical sequencing method. Among these females, 29 were identified as bi-infected. It is the first time that naturally occuring multiple infections of Wolbachia are detected within an individual A. vulgare host. Additionally, we resampled 6 of these populations in 2010 to check the infection status of females."
https://openalex.org/W1982499188,"Bifidobacteria have received significant attention due to their contribution to human gut health and the use of specific strains as probiotics. It is thus not surprising that there has also been significant interest with respect to their antibiotic resistance profile. Numerous culture-based studies have demonstrated that bifidobacteria are resistant to the majority of aminoglycosides, but are sensitive to β-lactams. However, limited research exists with respect to the genetic basis for the resistance of bifidobacteria to aminoglycosides. Here we performed an in-depth in silico analysis of putative Bifidobacterium-encoded aminoglycoside resistance proteins and β-lactamases and assess the contribution of these proteins to antibiotic resistance. The in silico-based screen detected putative aminoglycoside and β-lactam resistance proteins across the Bifidobacterium genus. Laboratory-based investigations of a number of representative bifidobacteria strains confirmed that despite containing putative β-lactamases, these strains were sensitive to β-lactams. In contrast, all strains were resistant to the aminoglycosides tested. To assess the contribution of genes encoding putative aminoglycoside resistance proteins in Bifidobacterium sp. two genes, namely Bbr_0651 and Bbr_1586, were targeted for insertional inactivation in B. breve UCC2003. As compared to the wild-type, the UCC2003 insertion mutant strains exhibited decreased resistance to gentamycin, kanamycin and streptomycin. This study highlights the associated risks of relying on the in silico assignment of gene function. Although several putative β-lactam resistance proteins are located in bifidobacteria, their presence does not coincide with resistance to these antibiotics. In contrast however, this approach has resulted in the identification of two loci that contribute to the aminoglycoside resistance of B. breve UCC2003 and, potentially, many other bifidobacteria."

Thus, in addition to its role in bile acid synthesis, where it converts cholesterol to 27-hydroxycholesterol (27-OHC), CYP27A1 may also be atheroprotective. Cyp27A1-deficient (Cyp27A1(-/-)) mice were crossed with apolipoprotein E (apoE)-deficient mice. Cyp27A1(+/+)/apoE(-/-) [ApoE-knockout (KO)], Cyp27A1(+/-)/apoE(-/-) heterozygous (het), and Cyp27A1(-/-)/apoE(-/-) [double-knockout (DKO)] mice were challenged with a Western diet (WD) for 3 and 6 mo. ApoE-KO mice fed a chow diet or a WD were used as the control. The severity of atherosclerosis in DKO mice was reduced 10-fold. Compared with the control, the DKO mice had no 27-OHC, total plasma cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein and very low density lipoprotein (LDL/VLDL) concentrations were reduced 2-fold, and HDL was elevated 2-fold. Expression of hepatic CYP7A1, CYP3A, and CYP8B1 were 5- to 10-fold higher. 3-Hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-CoA reductase (HMGR) activity increased 4-fold. Fecal cholesterol was increased. In contrast, het mice fed a WD developed accelerated atherosclerosis and severe skin lesions, possibly because of reduced reverse cholesterol transport due to diminished 27-OHC production. CYP27A1 activity is involved in the control of cholesterol homeostasis and development of atherosclerosis with a distinct gene dose-dependent effect."

Analysis of umbilical cord blood levels have also indicated that sRAGE levels in the infant are affected by maternal inflammation. S100b is a ligand for RAGE and increases in circulating S100b levels are associated with poor neurological outcome in preterm infants. The objective of this study was to determine whether sRAGE or s100b levels in plasma samples from extremely preterm infants at the end of the first week of life were correlated with infant morbidities and whether sRAGE and s100b levels at this time point were still associated with maternal inflammation.Plasma samples were collected from 130 preterm infants (≤28 weeks) at days of life 5, 6, or 7. sRAGE and s100b levels were measured by ELISA and data were analyzed by Pearson's correlation or Generalized Estimating Equations.sRAGE was negatively correlated with development of sepsis (p=0.024), the FiO2 requirement of the infant at the time of sampling (p=0.030), as well as maternal preeclampsia (p=0.046), and positively correlated with maternal chorioamnionitis (p=0.006). s100b levels were positively associated with maternal chorioamnionitis (p=0.039). No correlations were observed with other infant morbidities.These data indicate that sRAGE could potentially be a biomarker of early severe inflammatory responses in the preterm infant. However, more studies are needed to confirm the present findings."

The previous work from us and other groups identified MCPIP1 as an essential factor controlling inflammation and immune homeostasis. MCPIP1(-/-) developed severe anemia. However, the mechanisms underlying this phenotype remain unclear. In the present study, we found that MCPIP1 deficiency in mice resulted in severe anemia related to autoimmune mechanisms. Although MCPIP1 deficiency did not affect erythropoiesis per se, the erythropoiesis in MCPIP1(-/-) bone marrow erythroblasts was significantly attenuated due to iron and vitamin B12 (VB12) deficiency, which was mainly resulted from autoimmunity-associated gastritis and parietal cell loss. Consistently, exogenous supplement of iron and VB12 greatly improved the anemia phenotype of MCPIP1(-/-) mice. Finally, we have evidence suggesting that autoimmune hemolysis may also contribute to anemia phenotype of MCPIP1(-/-) mice. Taken together, our study suggests that MCPIP1 deficiency in mice leads to the development of autoimmune gastritis and pernicious anemia. Thus, MCPIP1(-/-) mice may be a good mouse model for investigating the pathogenesis of pernicious anemia and testing the efficacy of some potential drugs for treatment of this disease."
https://openalex.org/W2018763556,"Limited evidence exists on the utilization of surveillance colonoscopy in colorectal cancer (CRC) screening programs. We assessed adherence to physician recommendations for surveillance in opportunistic CRC screening in Germany.A follow-up study of screening colonoscopy participants in 2007-2009 in Saarland, Germany, was conducted using health insurance claims data. Utilization of additional colonoscopies through to 2011 was ascertained. Adherence to surveillance intervals of 3, 6, 12 and 36 months, defined as having had colonoscopy at 2.5 to 4, 5 to 8, 10.5 to 16 and 33 to 48 months, respectively (i.e., tolerating a delay of 33% of each interval) was assessed. Potential predictors of non-adherence were investigated using logistic regression analysis.A total of 20,058 screening colonoscopy participants were included in the study. Of those with recommended surveillance intervals of 3, 6, 12 and 36 months, 46.5% (95%-confidence interval [CI]: 37.3-55.7%), 38.5% (95%-CI: 29.6-47.3%), 25.4% (95%-CI: 21.2-29.6%) and 28.0% (95%-CI: 25.5-30.5%), respectively, had a subsequent colonoscopy within the specified margins. Old age, longer recommended surveillance interval, not having had polypectomy at screening and negative colonoscopy were statistically significant predictors of non-adherence.This study suggests frequent non-adherence to physician recommendations for surveillance colonoscopy in community practice. Increased efforts to improve adherence, including introduction of more elements of an organized screening program, seem necessary to assure a high-quality CRC screening process."
https://openalex.org/W2017685806,"Background Cyclooxygenase-2(COX-2) inhibitors provide desired analgesic effects after injury or surgery, but evidences suggested they also attenuate wound healing. The study is to investigate the effect of COX-2 inhibitor on random skin flap survival. Methods The McFarlane flap model was established in 40 rats and evaluated within two groups, each group gave the same volume of Parecoxib and saline injection for 7 days. The necrotic area of the flap was measured, the specimens of the flap were stained with haematoxylin-eosin(HE) for histologic analysis. Immunohistochemical staining was performed to analyse the level of VEGF and COX-2 . Results 7 days after operation, the flap necrotic area ratio in study group (66.65±2.81)% was significantly enlarged than that of the control group(48.81±2.33)%(P <0.01). Histological analysis demonstrated angiogenesis with mean vessel density per mm2 being lower in study group (15.4±4.4) than in control group (27.2±4.1) (P <0.05). To evaluate the expression of COX-2 and VEGF protein in the intermediate area II in the two groups by immunohistochemistry test .The expression of COX-2 in study group was (1022.45±153.1), and in control group was (2638.05±132.2) (P <0.01). The expression of VEGF in the study and control groups were (2779.45±472.0) vs (4938.05±123.6)(P <0.01).In the COX-2 inhibitor group, the expressions of COX-2 and VEGF protein were remarkably down-regulated as compared with the control group. Conclusion Selective COX-2 inhibitor had adverse effect on random skin flap survival. Suppression of neovascularization induced by low level of VEGF was supposed to be the biological mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W2022697063,"Sterol homeostasis is tightly controlled by the sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP) transcription factor that is highly conserved from fungi to mammals. In fission yeast, SREBP functions in an oxygen-sensing pathway to promote adaptation to decreased oxygen supply that limits oxygen-dependent sterol synthesis. Low oxygen stimulates proteolytic cleavage of the SREBP homolog Sre1, generating the active transcription factor Sre1N that drives expression of sterol biosynthetic enzymes. In addition, low oxygen increases the stability and DNA binding activity of Sre1N. To identify additional signals controlling Sre1 activity, we conducted a genetic overexpression screen. Here, we describe our isolation and characterization of the casein kinase 1 family member Hhp2 as a novel regulator of Sre1N. Deletion of Hhp2 increases Sre1N protein stability and ergosterol levels in the presence of oxygen. Hhp2-dependent Sre1N degradation by the proteasome requires Hhp2 kinase activity, and Hhp2 binds and phosphorylates Sre1N at specific residues. Our results describe a role for casein kinase 1 as a direct regulator of sterol homeostasis. Given the role of mammalian Hhp2 homologs, casein kinase 1δ and 1ε, in regulation of the circadian clock, these findings may provide a mechanism for coordinating circadian rhythm and lipid metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W2064402449,"Handedness/footedness and side biases are a well-known phenomenon in many animals, including humans. However, these so-called biases have mostly been studied at the population level--individual biases have received less attention, especially with regard to consistency over different tasks. Here we investigate behavioral lateralization in 12 male Budgerigars, Melopsittacus undulatus, a social parrot inhabiting the Australian bushlands. We performed 5 types of experiments to investigate lateralization, in tasks that involved climbing onto a perch, or landing on perches arranged in various configurations. The birds displayed highly significant, individually varying biases. The bias displayed by any particular individual varied with the task, in strength as well as polarity. Analysis of the data revealed that the preferred foot used for climbing did not coincide with the foot that was used while landing. Thus, landing choices are probably not determined by foot bias. Furthermore, these individual preferences were overridden completely when a bird had to perform a task simultaneously with another bird."
https://openalex.org/W1965451299,"The neural cell adhesion molecule L1CAM is a transmembrane glycoprotein abnormally expressed in tumors and previously associated with cell proliferation, adhesion and invasion, as well as neurite outgrowth in endometriosis. Being an attractive target molecule for antibody-based therapy, the present study assessed the ability of the monoclonal anti-L1 antibody (anti-L1 mAb) to impair the development of endometriotic lesions in vivo and endometriosis-associated nerve fiber growth.Endometriosis was experimentally induced in sexually mature B6C3F1 (n=34) and CD-1 nude (n=21) mice by autologous and heterologous transplantation, respectively, of endometrial fragments into the peritoneal cavity. Transplantation was confirmed four weeks post-surgery by in vivo magnetic resonance imaging and laparotomy, respectively. Mice were then intraperitoneally injected with anti-L1 mAb or an IgG isotype control antibody twice weekly, over a period of four weeks. Upon treatment completion, mice were sacrificed and endometrial implants were excised, measured and fixed. Endometriosis was histologically confirmed and L1CAM was detected by immunohistochemistry. Endometriotic lesion size was significantly reduced in anti-L1-treated B6C3F1 and CD-1 nude mice compared to mice treated with control antibody (P<0.05). Accordingly, a decreased number of PCNA positive epithelial and stromal cells was detected in autologously and heterologously induced endometriotic lesions exposed to anti-L1 mAb treatment. Anti-L1-treated mice also presented a diminished number of intraperitoneal adhesions at implantation sites compared with controls. Furthermore, a double-blind counting of anti-neurofilament L stained nerves revealed significantly reduced nerve density within peritoneal lesions in anti-L1 treated B6C3F1 mice (P=0.0039).Local anti-L1 mAb treatment suppressed endometriosis growth in B6C3F1 and CD-1 nude mice and exerted a potent anti-neurogenic effect on induced endometriotic lesions in vivo. The findings of this preliminary study in mice provide a strong basis for further testing in in vivo models."
https://openalex.org/W2142125822,"Microbes pose severe threats to animals as competitors or pathogens and strongly affect the evolution of life history traits like parental care. Females of the European beewolf Philanthus triangulum, a solitary digger wasp, provision their offspring with paralyzed honeybees and embalm them with the secretion from large postpharyngeal glands (PPG) that contain mainly unsaturated hydrocarbons. This coating changes the physico-chemical properties of the prey surface, causes a reduction of water condensation and retards growth of mold fungi. Here we examined the closely related South American genus Trachypus, which shows a life-history similar to Philanthus. We investigated whether Trachypus spp. also possess PPGs and embalm larval provisions. Using histological methods and 3D reconstructions we show that Trachypus boharti and T. elongatus possess PPGs that are similar to P. triangulum but somewhat smaller. The ultrastructure of the gland epithelium suggests that the gland content is at least partly sequestered from the hemolymph. Chemical analyses using gas chromatography / mass spectrometry revealed that both the cuticle and PPGs of Trachypus contain mainly unsaturated long-chain hydrocarbons. The gland of T. boharti additionally contains long-chain ketones. The hydrocarbons from the PPG of T. elongatus occurred on prey bees excavated from nests in the field but not on conspecific control bees. While the embalming only slightly elevated the amount of hydrocarbons on prey bees, the proportion of unsaturated hydrocarbons, which is crucial for the antifungal effect, was significantly increased. The Trachypus species under study possess PPGs that are very similar to the PPG of P. triangulum with regard to morphology, ultrastructure and chemistry. Moreover, we provide clear evidence that T. elongatus females embalm their prey, presumably as a means of prey preservation. The observed differences among Trachypus and Philanthus in gland size and prey embalming may have evolved in response to divergent ecological conditions."
https://openalex.org/W1964546546,"Hematodinium is a parasitic dinoflagellate and emerging pathogen of crustaceans. It preferably manifests in haemolymph of marine decapod crustaceans, killing a large variety of genera with significant impacts on fisheries worldwide. There is, however, evidence that some crustacean stocks harbor high prevalence, low intensity infections that may not result in widespread host mortality and are therefore hard to detect. The most widely used methods for detection of Hematodinium are conventional blood smears and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) against ribosomal RNAs. Blood smears demand a trained investigator, are labor intensive and not readily scalable for high-throughput sampling. PCRs only detect parasite DNA and can also suffer from false negatives and positives. In order to develop alternative detection tools for Hematodinium cells in decapod crustaceans we employed an immunological approach against a newly identified, abundant dinoflagellate-specific nuclear protein--Dinoflagellate/Viral NucleoProtein (DVNP). Both immunofluorescence assay (IFA) and Western blot methods against DVNP showed high sensitivity of detection. The Western blot detects Hematodinium parasites to levels of 25 parasites per milliliter of crustacean haemolymph, with the potential for sample pooling and screening of large samples. Using both PCR and these new tools, we have identified Hematodinium cells present in three new host crab taxa, at high prevalence but with no sign of pathogenesis. This extends the known range of Hematodinium to southern Australia."
https://openalex.org/W2118948331,"Children born to mothers with substantial alcohol consumption during pregnancy can present a number of morphological, cognitive, and sensory abnormalities, including hearing deficits, collectively known as fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS). The goal of this study was to determine if the zebrafish lateral line could be used to study sensory hair cell abnormalities caused by exposure to ethanol during embryogenesis. Some lateral line sensory hair cells are present at 2 days post-fertilization (dpf) and are functional by 5 dpf. Zebrafish embryos were raised in fish water supplemented with varying concentrations of ethanol (0.75%-1.75% by volume) from 2 dpf through 5 dpf. Ethanol treatment during development resulted in many physical abnormalities characteristic of FAS in humans. Also, the number of sensory hair cells decreased as the concentration of ethanol increased in a dose-dependent manner. The dye FM 1-43FX was used to detect the presence of functional mechanotransduction channels. The percentage of FM 1-43-labeled hair cells decreased as the concentration of ethanol increased. Methanol treatment did not affect the development of hair cells. The cell cycle markers proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) demonstrated that ethanol reduced the number of sensory hair cells, as a consequence of decreased cellular proliferation. There was also a significant increase in the rate of apoptosis, as determined by TUNEL-labeling, in neuromasts following ethanol treatment during larval development. Therefore, zebrafish are a useful animal model to study the effects of hair cell developmental disorders associated with FAS."
https://openalex.org/W2065456106,"To assess the feasibility of low-dose prospective ECG-gated dual-source CT (DSCT) in detecting airway anomalies in pediatric patients with cardiovascular anomalies compared with flexible tracheobronchoscopy (FTB).33 pediatrics with respiratory symptoms who had been revealed cardiovascular anomalies by transthoracic echocardiography underwent FTB and contrast material-enhanced prospective ECG-triggering CT were enrolled. The study was approved by our institution review board and written informed consent was obtained from all patients' guardian. DSCT examinations were performed to detect cardiovascular abnormalities using weight-adjusted low-dose protocol. Two radiologists independently performed CT image analysis. The FTB reports were reviewed by an experienced pulmonologist. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), and accuracy of DSCT in the detection of airway anomalies were assessed. The tracheobronchial stenoses revealed on FTB were graded. Effective radiation dose was calculated.Thirty cases were diagnosed with tracheobronchial narrowing and/or abnormality in 33 patients by FTB, while 3 patients had normal FTB findings. Twenty-eight cases were diagnosed with airway anomalies by CT, of which 27 were correct positive. 3 patients with normal findings at CT had findings of tracheobronchial narrowing due to tracheobronchomalacia at inspiration at FTB. Sensitivity and specificity of CT were 90.0% (95% CI: 72.3%, 97.4%) and 66.7% (95% CI: 12.5 %, 98.2 %), respectively. PPV and NPV were 96.4% (95% CI: 79.8 %, 99.8%) and 40.0% (95% CI: 7.3%, 83.0%), respectively. Overall accuracy of DSCT in detecting airway anomalies in pediatrics with cardiovascular anomalies was 87.9% (95% CI: 74.5%, 97.6%). In grading of tracheobronchial stenosis, images from CT correlated closely (r = 0.89) with those of FTB. Mean effective dose was 0.60 ± 0.20 mSv.In pediatric patients, ECG-triggered CT to evaluate congenital cardiovascular anomalies can also be used to diagnose and characterize fixed airway involvement in relation to the vascular structures."
https://openalex.org/W2093270348,"Previous research has yielded evidence for enhanced semantic priming in formal thought-disordered schizophrenia patients, a result that fits well with the hypothesis of disinhibited processes of spreading activation in this population.The current study examined whether hyper priming among schizophrenia patients is an outcome of further spreading of activation of a node or a result of farther activation of nodes in the semantic network. We also try to shed light on the fate of this activation.The present study tested this hypothesis by using semantic and identical priming in two different experiments. SOA (stimulus onset asynchrony) was manipulated (240 ms vs. 740 ms) within block. It is assumed that among healthy individuals, performance relies on a balance between activation and inhibition processes, contrary to in schizophrenic individuals. In order to examine this hypothesis, we compared formal thought-disordered schizophrenia patients, non thought-disordered schizophrenia patients, and healthy controls.For thought-disordered schizophrenia patients, we found a large positive semantic effect and identical priming effect (129 ms and 154 ms, respectively) only with short SOA. SOA and type of priming did not modulate priming effects in the control groups.This result supports the claim that there is a lack of inhibitory processes among thought-disordered patients. Hyper priming in the thought-disorder group may be an outcome of hyper activation followed by rapid decay below baseline threshold."
