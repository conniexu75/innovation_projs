However, such devices all use hard materials. Kim et al. have developed a soft touch panel based on polyacrylamide hydrogels (cross-linked polymers swollen with water) that are highly transparent and contain trapped LiCl to enhance conductivity. The hydrogels are soft and can be stretched extensively while still maintaining touch sensitivity. Science , this issue p. 682"

Marine species are likely to be very long-lived, but determining their age is particularly difficult. Nielsen et al. used the pulse of carbon-14 produced by nuclear tests in the 1950s—specifically, its incorporation into the eye during development—to determine the age of Greenland sharks. This species is large yet slow-growing. The oldest of the animals that they sampled had lived for nearly 400 years, and they conclude that the species reaches maturity at about 150 years of age.

Whicher and Mackinnon determined the structure of a mammalian Eag1 bound to the inhibitor calmodulin at 3.78 Å resolution (see the Perspective by Toombes and Swartz). The organization of the voltage-sensing and pore domains differs from that of other potassium channels, indicating that the gating mechanism is distinct. The structure also shows how the channel can be closed by a ligand, independently of the position of the voltage sensor. Science , this issue p. 664 ; see also p. 646"

The experimental creation of such ensembles has been technically challenging. Using two-photon optogenetic stimulation with single-cell resolution, Carrillo-Reid et al. discovered that recurrent activation of a group of neurons creates an ensemble that is imprinted in the brain circuitry. Activation of a single neuron can lead to recall of the entire ensemble in a phenomenon called pattern completion. The artificial ensemble persists over days and can be reactivated at later time points without interfering with endogenous circuitry. Science , this issue p. 691"

Deuteron properties such as the root-mean-square charge radius rd and the polarizability serve as important benchmarks for understanding the nuclear forces and structure. Muonic deuterium μd is the exotic atom formed by a deuteron and a negative muon μ(-). We measured three 2S-2P transitions in μd and obtain r(d) = 2.12562(78) fm, which is 2.7 times more accurate but 7.5σ smaller than the CODATA-2010 value r(d) = 2.1424(21) fm. The μd value is also 3.5σ smaller than the r(d) value from electronic deuterium spectroscopy. The smaller r(d), when combined with the electronic isotope shift, yields a ""small"" proton radius r(p), similar to the one from muonic hydrogen, amplifying the proton radius puzzle."
https://openalex.org/W2510451242,"Dendrites of cortical pyramidal neurons contain intermingled excitatory and inhibitory synapses. We studied the local mechanisms that regulate the formation and distribution of synapses. We found that local γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) release on dendrites of mouse cortical layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons could induce gephyrin puncta and dendritic spine formation via GABA type A receptor activation and voltage-gated calcium channels during early postnatal development. Furthermore, the newly formed inhibitory and excitatory synaptic structures rapidly gained functions. Bidirectional manipulation of GABA release from somatostatin-positive interneurons increased and decreased the number of gephyrin puncta and dendritic spines, respectively. These results highlight a noncanonical function of GABA as a local synaptogenic element shaping the early establishment of neuronal circuitry in mouse cortex."

https://openalex.org/W2509967529,"Targeting three defects with one strategy The neurodegenerative diseases amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal dementia are most commonly caused by a mutation in the C9orf72 gene. The mutation is an expanded hexanucleotide repeat in a noncoding region. The expanded repeat produces sense and antisense RNA transcripts, which accumulate in patient cells and appear to sequester RNA-binding proteins. The sense and antisense transcripts are also translated into dipeptide repeat proteins, which are aggregation-prone and accumulate in the brain and spinal cord. Last, loss of function from reduced expression of C9orf72 in neurons and glia could contribute to the disease. Kramer et al. targeted both sense and antisense repeats by blocking a single gene called SPT4 , which mitigated degeneration in human cells by reducing all three types of pathologies.

The ease with which the iron in the center of the molecule can toggle between the +2 and +3 oxidation states has made the compound a common electrochemical standard.

The activity of ASK1 is triggered by various stress stimuli and is involved in the pathogenesis of cancer, neurodegeneration, inflammation, and diabetes. ASK1 forms a high molecular mass complex whose activity is, under non-stress conditions, suppressed through interaction with thioredoxin and the scaffolding protein 14-3-3. The 14-3-3 protein binds to the phosphorylated Ser-966 motif downstream of the ASK1 kinase domain. The role of 14-3-3 in the inhibition of ASK1 has yet to be elucidated. In this study we performed structural analysis of the complex between the ASK1 kinase domain phosphorylated at Ser-966 (pASK1-CD) and the 14-3-3ζ protein. Small angle x-ray scattering (SAXS) measurements and chemical cross-linking revealed that the pASK1-CD·14-3-3ζ complex is dynamic and conformationally heterogeneous.

The human ASK1 consists of 1374 amino acid residues with the serine/threonine kinase domain being centrally located and flanked by two coiled-coil (CC) domains. ASK1 forms a high molecular mass complex called ASK1 signalosome under non-stress conditions in which ASK1 homo-oligomerizes through the C-terminal CC domain and interacts with several other proteins including ASK2, thioredoxin, and the 14-3-3 protein (Fig. 1A) (3Noguchi T.

In response to oxidative stress, both thioredoxin and 14-3-3 dissociate from ASK1 followed by the homo-oligomerization of ASK1 and the recruitment of tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factors 2 and 6. This, in turn, accelerates the autophosphorylation of Thr-838 within the activation segment resulting in ASK1 activation (5Saitoh M. Nishitoh H. Fujii M. Takeda K. Tobiume K. Sawada Y. Kawabata M.

Through these binding interactions, 14-3-3 proteins regulate many biological processes such as cell cycle progression, initiation of apoptosis, control of gene transcription, and neuroendocrine transduction (10Freeman A.K.

For example, the 14-3-3-dependent activation of serotonin N-acetyltransferase (AANAT) and yeast neutral trehalase (Nth1) has been shown to be based on a direct structural change of the catalytic site (13Obsil T.

Cell. 2007; 25: 427-440Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). A functional role of 14-3-3 in the regulation of ASK1 was first suggested by the observation that under non-stress conditions 14-3-3ζ recognizes a motif containing phosphoserine Ser(P)-966 located at the C terminus of ASK1 kinase domain (Fig. 1A) and that the replacement of this residue to alanine dramatically accelerates ASK1-induced cell death (6Zhang L. Chen J. Fu H. Suppression of apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1-induced cell death by 14-3-3 proteins.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1999; 96: 8511-8515Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). It was subsequently shown that the oxidative stress-induced dephosphorylation of Ser(P)-966 is accompanied by an increased autokinase activity of ASK1 and that the 14-3-3 binding-defective mutant ASK1 S966A shows increased both autokinase and transkinase activities (7Goldman E.H. Chen L. Fu H. Activation of apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 by reactive oxygen species through dephosphorylation at serine 967 and 14-3-3 dissociation.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 10442-10449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). However, the molecular mechanism of the 14-3-3-dependent regulation of ASK1 remains elusive. In this work, we performed structural analysis of the complex between the kinase domain of ASK1 (sequence 659–973) phosphorylated at Ser-966 and the 14-3-3ζ protein using small angle x-ray scattering (SAXS) and chemical cross-linking. In addition, we also investigated whether the 14-3-3ζ binding affects conformation of the active site of ASK1. The interaction between pASK1-CD and 14-3-3ζ was first studied using sedimentation velocity (SV) analytical ultracentrifugation (AUC) by analyzing their mixtures at various molar ratios (Fig. 1D). The direct modeling of obtained SV AUC data using the Lamm equation revealed the best fit apparent equilibrium dissociation constant (KD) of 36 ± 7 μm using a Langmuir binding model with one dimer of pASK1-CD interacting with one dimer of 14-3-3ζWT. To increase the stability of the complex, we prepared 14-3-3ζ deleted of its C-terminal 15 residues (14-3-3ζΔC), which binds ligands with significantly higher affinity (17Ottmann C. Marco S. Jaspert N. Marcon C. Schauer N. Weyand M. Vandermeeren C. Duby G. Boutry M. Wittinghofer A. Rigaud J.L. Oecking C.

Indeed, 14-3-3ζΔC showed significantly increased binding affinity for pASK1-CD with the best-fit KD value of 4 ± 2 μm (Fig. 1E). The observed value of sw(20,w) of 6.2S for the complex (based on c(s) distribution of mixture with highest molar ratio of 14-3-3ζΔC to pASK1-CD shown in purple in Fig. 1E) corresponds to a Mr of ∼121, thus suggesting the 2:2 molar stoichiometry of the complex (a dimer of pASK1-CD bound to a dimer of 14-3-3ζΔC, theoretical Mr 128.9). Considering the significantly improved binding affinity of pASK1-CD for 14-3-3ζΔC compared with WT, we decided to use 14-3-3ζΔC rather than 14-3-3ζWT throughout this work. The pASK1-CD used in this study is enzymatically active, allowing us to perform activity measurements to compare the properties of complexed and free pASK1-CD. Human mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 4 (MKK4), a physiological target of ASK1, was used as a specific substrate. As noticed, the addition of 14-3-3ζΔC suppressed the activity of pASK1-CD relative to the uncomplexed protein by ∼40%, whereas no significant decrease in kinase activity was observed for the 14-3-3 binding-defective mutant pASK1-CD S966A (Fig. 1F, the specific activities are listed in supplemental Table S1). The 14-3-3ζ-dependent inhibition of pASK1-CD enzyme activity is consistent with data published by Fu and co-workers (6Zhang L. Chen J. Fu H. Suppression of apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1-induced cell death by 14-3-3 proteins.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1999; 96: 8511-8515Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar, 7Goldman E.H.

The scattering data for 14-3-3ζΔC alone and ASK1-CD alone as well as the pASK1-CD·14-3-3ζΔC complex (mixed with 2:2 molar stoichiometry) were collected at various concentrations (Table 1). The complex was prepared at concentrations of ∼60, 95, and 137 μm, thus sufficiently above the KD (∼4 μm). The Guinier plots and the concentration dependence of the forward scattering intensity I(0), the Porod volume Vp, and the radius of gyration Rg were used to assess the data quality. The Guinier plots were sufficiently linear for all samples except a small deviation at the highest complex concentration (Fig. 2). Because the concentration dependence of Rg and I(0) suggested the presence of repulsive interparticle interactions in samples of 14-3-3ζΔC and attractive interparticle interactions in samples of ASK1-CD and the complex at highest protein concentrations (Table 1), data for 14-3-3ζΔC, ASK1-CD, and the complex at concentrations of 7.7, 6.3, and 12.2 mg·ml−1, respectively, were selected for ab initio shape reconstruction and structural modeling. The apparent Mr of 68.2 and 51 for ASK1-CD and 14-3-3ζΔC, respectively, estimated from I(0) correspond well with the expected Mr of their dimers (Table 1). The estimated Mr of 117.4 for the complex as well as its Vp of 236 nm3 correspond well to a 2:2 molar stoichiometry (theoretical Mr 128.9), thus corroborating results from SV AUC (for globular proteins, Vp in nm3 should numerically be ∼1.7 times the Mr; Ref. 19Petoukhov M.V.

How random are intrinsically disordered proteins? A small angle scattering perspective.Curr. Protein Pept. Sci. 2012; 13: 55-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). However, the normalized Kratky plot of the complex indicates an increase in the degree of the flexibility exhibited by the complex as indicated by the more gradual decrease of the curve toward zero at higher sRg and a maximum at sRg = 2.2.

The theoretical scattering curve calculated from the crystal structure fits the experimental data reasonably well (Fig. 4B, χ = 0.97, Rg = 29.2 Å). The ab initio shape reconstruction statistics are listed in Table 2. The superposition of ab initio molecular envelope of ASK1-CD with the AllosMod model of ASK1-CD (659–973) also showed correct reproduction of the shape and fit well the experimental SAXS data (Fig. 4, C and D, χ = 1.00, Rg = 33.3 Å). The molecular envelope of the pASK1-CD·14-3-3ζΔC complex is, as expected, significantly more extended compared with ASK1-CD and 14-3-3ζΔC alone, and its shape, with one side being narrower than the other, suggests that protein components are arranged asymmetrically (Fig. 4E).TABLE 2Ab initio shape reconstruction statisticsParameter14-3-3ζΔCASK1-CDComplex (2:2)c (mg·ml−1)7.76.312.2Angular range (nm−1)0.11-3.080.17–2.440.12–2.40Real space range (nm−1)0–8.50–10.90–16.1GNOM total estimate0.780.560.51SymmetryP2P2P1χaDiscrepancy between the simulated scattering curve and the experimental data.0.800.90–0.930.98–1.01Number of models averaged/total14/1513/1514/15Damaver NSD0.790.780.89a Discrepancy between the simulated scattering curve and the experimental data. Open table in a new tab The chemical cross-linking experiments were performed to obtain distance restraints for structural modeling of the complex. Identified intermolecular cross-links connecting four different regions of pASK1-CD with four different regions of 14-3-3ζΔC are listed in Table 3. In several cases we were unable to identify the exact cross-linked residue, as the corresponding peptides contained multiple, usually closely located, lysine residues. Cross-link #1 connects the N-terminal amino group of Met-658 of pASK1-CD and the N-terminal part of helix H6 of 14-3-3ζΔC containing two lysines, Lys-122 and Lys-138 (supplemental Fig. S2). Cross-link #2 was identified between the C terminus of helix αC from the N-lobe of pASK1-CD containing Lys-730 (or Lys-733) and the C terminus of helix H6 of 14-3-3ζΔC containing Lys-158. Cross-link #3 connects Lys-925 from the loop between helices αH and αI of the C-lobe of pASK1-CD and Lys-85 from the helix H4 of 14-3-3ζΔC. Cross-link #4 connects the C-terminal part of pASK1-CD containing lysines Lys-944, Lys-945, and Lys-946 and the C terminus of helix H3 of 14-3-3ζΔC containing Lys-68. The last cross-link was identified between lysines Lys-944–Lys-946 of pASK1-CD and residue Lys-120 from the helix H5 of 14-3-3ζΔC. However, this cross-link was also observed for the mixture of non-phosphorylated ASK1-CD and thus was not used in structural modeling of the complex as it likely results from unspecific interaction between ASK1-CD and 14-3-3ζΔC.TABLE 3Intermolecular cross-links between ASK1-CD and 14-3-3ζΔC obtained with BS2GCross-linked peptidesCross-linked residuesCross-link numberASK1-CD14-3-3ζΔCASK1-CD-14-3-3ζΔCObserved massErrorppm1aCross-links 1–5 were observed for the mixture of pASK1-CD and 14-3-3ζΔC.658–659121–139Met-658bResidue Met-658 is the N-terminal Met residue of ASK1-CD construct.- (Lys-122 or Lys-138)2594.22973.32718–735158–167(Lys-730 or Lys-733)-Lys-1583539.85992.83918–92684–91Lys-925–Lys-852219.07082.54944–95061–75(Lys-944 or Lys-945 or Lys-946)-Lys-682585.44701.65944–945cLys-944–Lys-945 or Lys-945–Lys-946 (from the ASK1 region 943KKKK946).116–122(Lys-944 or Lys-945)-Lys-1201298.75281.36dThis cross-link was observed for the mixture of not-phosphorylated ASK1-CD and 14-3-3ζΔC.944–945cLys-944–Lys-945 or Lys-945–Lys-946 (from the ASK1 region 943KKKK946).116–122(Lys-944 or Lys-945)-Lys-1201298.75330.9a Cross-links 1–5 were observed for the mixture of pASK1-CD and 14-3-3ζΔC.b Residue Met-658 is the N-terminal Met residue of ASK1-CD construct.c Lys-944–Lys-945 or Lys-945–Lys-946 (from the ASK1 region 943KKKK946).d This cross-link was observed for the mixture of not-phosphorylated ASK1-CD and 14-3-3ζΔC. Open table in a new tab The all-atom modeling of the pASK1-CD·14-3-3ζΔC complex was first performed using the AllosMod-FoXS method (22Weinkam P. Pons J. Sali A.

Hammel M. Sali A. FoXS: a web server for rapid computation and fitting of SAXS profiles.Nucleic Acids Res. 2010; 38: W540-W544Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). The best-scoring single-state AllosMod model fits the SAXS data with χ = 1.66 and shows the C-lobe of one protomer of ASK1-CD interacting with α-helices H4 and H6 of 14-3-3ζ outside its central channel through a relatively small binding interface (Fig. 5, A and B). Although this model satisfies three identified cross-links within a distance threshold of 30 Å and shows a reasonable agreement with the ab initio molecular envelope (Fig. 5C), calculated χ value together with theoretical values of Rg and Dmax (43.1 and 156.7 Å, respectively), which are significantly smaller compared with values obtained from the SAXS data (Table 1), suggested this model does not reproduce the experimental SAXS data correctly. Because normalized Kratky plot indicated an increased degree of flexibility exhibited by the complex (Fig. 3B), a multistate modeling of the complex for up to five states using the MultiFoXS method that enables modeling of conformationally heterogeneous systems was performed next (24Raveh B.

J. 2015; 109: 793-805Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The resulting best-scoring model is based on a weighted combination of three states and provides a significantly improved fit to the SAXS data with χ of 0.97 as well as agreement with cross-linking data within a distance threshold of 30 Å (Fig. 6). Combinations of two, four, or five states did not yield any solution that would better describe the SAXS data compared with the three-state model. The model consists of two compact states with population weights of 43% (Rg = 41.6 Å, Dmax = 153.5 Å) and 18% (Rg = 37.9 Å, Dmax = 139.0 Å) where the C-lobe of one protomer of ASK1-CD faces either the α-helix H6 or loops between helices H2-H3 and H4-H5 of 14-3-3ζ and one extended state with the population weight of 39% (Rg = 56.6 Å, Dmax = 214.3 Å), where 14-3-3ζ and ASK1-CD are separated but still connected through the C-terminal segment of ASK1-CD. A significantly better agreement of this three-state model with the SAXS data compared with the single-state AllosMod model suggested that the pASK1-CD·14-3-3ζΔC complex is conformationally heterogeneous in solution with both proteins sampling various mutual orientations. Structural modeling suggested that 14-3-3ζ interacts with the C-lobe of pASK1-CD in close proximity to both the active site and activation segment (Fig. 7). This brings up the possibility that the 14-3-3 binding might affect conformation of this region either directly or indirectly. Because the activation segment contains two autophosphorylation sites that are phosphorylated in our recombinant protein (Thr(P)-838 and Thr(P)-842, supplemental Fig. S1), 31P NMR experiments were performed to study structural changes of this region upon the 14-3-3ζ binding. The 31P NMR spectrum of pASK1-CD alone showed a strong and narrow resonance at 4.6 ppm and 2 overlapping resonances at 3–4.25 ppm (Fig. 8). All these resonances lie within the range ∼3–5 ppm expected for chemical shifts of Ser(P) and Thr(P) at neutral pH (26Bock J.L. Sheard B. 31P NMR of alkaline phosphatase.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1975; 66: 24-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The spectrum of the 14-3-3 binding-defective mutant pASK1-CD S966A alone contains only resonances at 3–4.25 ppm, thus strongly suggesting that resonance at 4.6 ppm corresponds to 31P nuclei of Ser(P)-966. The narrow line width of this resonance likely reflects the high flexibility of the C-terminal segment. Two broad overlapping resonances at 3–4.25 ppm likely correspond to 31P nuclei of autophosphorylation sites Thr(P)-838 and Thr(P)-842, the only other phospho-residues present in our recombinant pASK1-CD (the third autophosphorylation site Thr-813 was phosphorylated negligibly, supplemental Fig. S1, A–C). The spectrum of 14-3-3ζΔC alone exhibited a single resonance at 5.25 ppm, suggesting the presence of one weakly phosphorylated site in the recombinant protein. The addition of 14-3-3ζΔC to pASK1-CD significantly suppressed resonance of Ser(P)-966 at 4.6 ppm, likely due to its binding into the ligand binding groove of 14-3-3, and changed ratio of intensities of Thr(P)-838 and Thr(P)-842 resonances at 3–4.25 ppm. On the other hand and as expected, no changes were observed in the spectr"
https://openalex.org/W2341168710,"Motivations Gene trees inferred solely from multiple alignments of homologous sequences often contain weakly supported and uncertain branches. Information for their full resolution may lie in the dependency between gene families and their genomic context. Integrative methods, using species tree information in addition to sequence information, often rely on a computationally intensive tree space search which forecloses an application to large genomic databases. Results We propose a new method, called ProfileNJ, that takes a gene tree with statistical supports on its branches, and corrects its weakly supported parts by using a combination of information from a species tree and a distance matrix. Its low running time enabled us to use it on the whole Ensembl Compara database, for which we propose an alternative, arguably more plausible set of gene trees. This allowed us to perform a genome-wide analysis of duplication and loss patterns on the history of 63 eukaryote species, and predict ancestral gene content and order for all ancestors along the phylogeny.

Here, we present QTLs associated with flowering time, maturity, plant height, and grain yield using high density single nucleotide polymorphic (SNP) markers in the same population. A mapping population of 158 RILs and the two parents were evaluated at five environments for flowering, maturity, plant height and grain yield under field conditions, at two greenhouse environments for flowering, and genotyped with a subset of 1809 SNPs out of the 90K SNP array and 2 functional markers (Ppd-D1 and Rht-D1). Using composite interval mapping on the combined phenotype data across all environments, we identified a total of 19 QTLs associated with flowering time in greenhouse (5), and field (6) conditions, maturity (5), grain yield (2) and plant height (1). We mapped these QTLs on 8 chromosomes and they individually explained between 6.3 and 37.8% of the phenotypic variation. Four of the 19 QTLs were associated with multiple traits, including a QTL on 2D associated with flowering, maturity and grain yield; two QTLs on 4A and 7A associated with flowering and maturity, and another QTL on 4D associated with maturity and plant height. However, only the QTLs on both 2D and 4D had major effects, and they mapped adjacent to well-known photoperiod response Ppd-D1 and height reducing Rht-D1 genes, respectively. The QTL on 2D reduced flowering and maturity time up to 5 days with a yield penalty of 436 kg ha-1, while the QTL on 4D reduced plant height by 13 cm, but increased maturity by 2 days. The high density SNPs allowed us to map eight moderate effect, two major effect, and nine minor effect QTLs that were not identified in our previous study using microsatellite and DArT markers.

https://openalex.org/W2510205178,"Climate changes lead to rising temperatures during summer periods and dramatic economic losses in dairy production. Modern high-yielding dairy cows experience severe metabolic stress during the transition period between late gestation and early lactation to meet the high energy and nutrient requirements of the fetus or the mammary gland, and additional thermal stress during this time has adverse implications on metabolism and welfare. The mechanisms enabling metabolic adaptation to heat apart from the decline in feed intake and milk yield are not fully elucidated yet. To distinguish between feed intake and heat stress related effects, German Holstein dairy cows were first kept at thermoneutral conditions at 15°C followed by exposure to heat-stressed (HS) at 28°C or pair-feeding (PF) at 15°C for 6 days; in late-pregnancy and again in early lactation. Liver and muscle biopsies and plasma samples were taken to assess major metabolic pathway regulation using real-time PCR and Western Blot. The results indicate that during heat stress, late pregnant cows activate Cahill but reduce Cori cycling, prevent increase in skeletal muscle fatty acid oxidation, and utilize increased amounts of pyruvate for gluconeogenesis, without altering ureagenesis despite reduced plane of nutrition. These homeorhetic adaptations are employed to reduce endogenous heat production while diverting amino acids to the growing fetus. Metabolic adaptation to heat stress in early lactation involves increased long-chain fatty acid degradation in muscle peroxisomes, allowance for muscle glucose utilization but diminished hepatic use of amino acid-derived pyruvate for gluconeogenesis and reduced peroxisomal fatty acid oxidation and ATP production in liver of HS compared to PF cows in early lactation. Consequently, metabolic adaptation to heat stress and reduced feed intake differ between late pregnancy and early lactation of dairy cows to maintain energy supply for fetus development or milk production simultaneously reducing endogenous heat production."

https://openalex.org/W2515308953,"Occupational exposure to respirable crystalline silica (cSiO2, quartz) is etiologically linked to systemic lupus erythematosus (lupus) and other human autoimmune diseases (ADs). In the female NZBWF1 mouse, a widely used animal model that is genetically prone to lupus, short-term repeated intranasal exposure to cSiO2 triggers premature initiation of autoimmune responses in the lungs and kidneys. In contrast to cSiO2's triggering action, consumption of the ω-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) prevents spontaneous onset of autoimmunity in this mouse strain. The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that consumption of DHA will prevent cSiO2-triggered autoimmunity in the female NZBWF1 mouse. Mice (6 wk old) were fed isocaloric AIN-93G diets containing 0.0, 0.4, 1.2 or 2.4% DHA. Two wk after initiating feeding, mice were intranasally instilled with 1 mg cSiO2 once per wk for 4 wk and maintained on experimental diets for an additional 12 wk. Mice were then sacrificed and the lung, blood and kidney assessed for markers of inflammation and autoimmunity. DHA was incorporated into lung, red blood cells and kidney from diet in a concentration-dependent fashion. Dietary DHA dose-dependently suppressed cSiO2-triggered perivascular leukocyte infiltration and ectopic lymphoid tissue neogenesis in the lung. DHA consumption concurrently inhibited cSiO2-driven elevation of proinflammatory cytokines, B-cell proliferation factors, IgG and anti-dsDNA Ig in both bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and plasma. DHA's prophylactic effects were further mirrored in reduced proteinuria and glomerulonephritis in cSiO2-treated mice. Taken together, these results reveal that DHA consumption suppresses cSiO2 triggering of autoimmunity in female NZBWF1 mice as manifested in the lung, blood and kidney. Our findings provide novel insight into how dietary modulation of the lipidome might be used to prevent or delay triggering of AD by cSiO2. Such knowledge opens the possibility of developing practical, low-cost preventative strategies to reduce the risk of initiating AD and subsequent flaring in cSiO2-exposed individuals. Additional research in this model is required to establish the mechanisms by which DHA suppresses cSiO2-induced autoimmunity and to ascertain unique lipidome signatures predictive of susceptibility to cSiO2-triggered AD."
https://openalex.org/W2517641615,"Background Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is one of the chronic autoimmune diseases, with genetic and environmental predisposition, and synovial angiogenesis is considered to be a notable stage in its pathogenesis. Angiogenesis or vascular proliferation has been suggested to be a pivotal mechanism involved in both inflammation/immune activation and joint invasion and destruction. RA may be considered an “angiogenic disease” because it is associated with active tissue neovascularization. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) promotes vascular permeability, regulates angiogenesis, endothelial cell proliferation and migration, chemotaxis, and capillary hyper permeability and therefore is involved in the development of inflammation. VEGF is the most potent proangiogenic molecule promoting the angiogenic phenotype of RA and is upregulated in RA. Objectives The aim of the study was to identify functional VEGF variants and their possible association with VEGF expression, susceptibility to and severity of RA. Methods 581 RA patients and of 341 healthy individuals were examined for -1154 A/G, -2578 A/C VEGF gene polymorphisms by PCR-RFLP method and for -634 G/C VEGF gene polymorphisms by TaqMan SNP genotyping assay. Serum VEGF levels in RA patients and controls were measured by ELISA. Results The -1154 A/G VEGF gene polymorphism under the codominant, recessive (AA+AG vs. GG) and dominant (AA vs. AG+GG) models were associated with RA (p = 0.0009; p = 0.004; p = 0.017, respectively). VEGF -2578 A/C revealed differences in the case-control distribution in codominant, recessive, dominant and overdominant models (all p<0.0001). Furthermore, the -634 G/C VEGF gene SNP was not correlated with susceptibility to RA in Polish population. The genotype-phenotype analysis showed significant association between the VEGF -1154 A/G and -634 G/C and mean value of the hemoglobin (all p = 0.05), additionally they relevated that the number of women with the polymorphic allele -2578 C was lower than the number of women with wild type allele -2578A (p = 0.006). Serum VEGF levels were significantly higher in RA patients than in control groups (both p = 0,0001). Conclusion Present findings indicated that VEGF genetic polymorphism as well as VEGF protein levels may be associated with the susceptibility to RA in the Polish population."

Synthetic chimeric proteins comprising fragments of repetitive amino acids of several different proteins have been shown to improve assay performances to detect Chagasic infections. Here, we describe the production of four chimeric T. cruzi proteins and the assessment of their performance for diagnostic purposes. Circular Dichroism spectra indicated the absence of well-defined secondary structures, while polydispersity evaluated by Dynamic Light Scattering revealed only minor aggregates in 50 mM carbonate-bicarbonate (pH 9.6), demonstrating that it is an appropriate buffering system for sensitizing microplates. Serum samples from T. cruzi-infected and non-infected individuals were used to assess the performance of these antigens for detecting antibodies against T. cruzi, using both enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and a liquid bead array platform. Performance parameters (AUC, sensitivity, specificity, accuracy and J index) showed high diagnostic accuracy for all chimeric proteins for detection of specific anti-T. cruzi antibodies and differentiated seropositive individuals from those who were seronegative.

https://openalex.org/W2514060942,"Ralstonia solanacearum is a soil-borne plant pathogen that infects more than 200 plant species. Its broad host range and long-term survival under different environmental stress conditions suggest that it uses a variety of mechanisms to protect itself against various types of biotic and abiotic stress. R. solanacearum produces a melanin-like brown pigment in the stationary phase when grown in minimal medium containing tyrosine. To gain deeper insight into the genetic determinants involved in melanin production, transposon-inserted mutants of R. solanacearum strain SL341 were screened for strains with defective melanin-producing capability. In addition to one mutant already known to be involved in pyomelanin production (viz., strain SL341D, with disruption of the hydroxphenylpyruvate dioxygenase gene), we identified three other mutants with disruption in the regulatory genes rpoS, hrpG, and oxyR, respectively. Wild-type SL341 produced pyomelanin in minimal medium containing tyrosine whereas the mutant strains did not. Likewise, homogentisate, a major precursor of pyomelanin, was detected in the culture filtrate of the wild-type strain but not in those of the mutant strains. A gene encoding hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase exhibited a significant high expression in wild type SL341 compared to other mutant strains, suggesting that pyomelanin production is regulated by three different regulatory proteins. However, analysis of the gene encoding homogentisate dioxygenase revealed no significant difference in its relative expression over time in the wild-type SL341 and mutant strains, except for SL341D, at 72 h incubation. The pigmented SL341 strain also exhibited a high tolerance to hydrogen peroxide stress compared with the non-pigmented SL341D strain. Our study suggests that pyomelanin production is controlled by several regulatory factors in R. solanacearum to confer protection under oxidative stress."

https://openalex.org/W2514720402,"Although the ability to elaborate calcium carbonate biominerals was apparently gained independently during animal evolution, members of the alpha carbonic anhydrases (α-CAs) family, which catalyze the interconversion of CO2 into HCO3-, are involved in the biomineralization process across metazoans. In the Mediterranean red coral Corallium rubrum, inhibition studies suggest an essential role of CAs in the synthesis of two biominerals produced in this octocoral, the axial skeleton and the sclerites. Hitherto no molecular characterization of these enzymes was available. In the present study we determined the complete set of α-CAs in C. rubrum by data mining the genome and transcriptome, and measured their differential gene expression between calcifying and non-calcifying tissues. We identified six isozymes (CruCA1-6), one cytosolic and five secreted/membrane-bound among which one lacked two of the three zinc-binding histidines and was so referred to as a carbonic anhydrase related protein (CARP). One secreted isozyme (CruCA4) showed specific expression both by qPCR and western-blot in the calcifying tissues, suggesting its involvement in biomineralization. Moreover, phylogenetic analyses of α-CAs, identified in six representative cnidarians with complete genome, support an independent recruitment of α-CAs for biomineralization within anthozoans. Finally, characterization of cnidarian CARPs highlighted two families: the monophyletic cytosolic CARPs, and the polyphyletic secreted CARPs harboring a cnidarian specific cysteine disulfide bridge. Alignment of the cytosolic CARPs revealed an evolutionary conserved R-H-Q motif in place of the characteristic zinc-binding H-H-H necessary for the catalytic function of α-CAs."

Bisphosphonates, a widely used anti-bone resorptive drug with minimal systemic side effects, have been linked to an abnormal wound healing in the oral barrier tissue leading to, in some cases, osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ). Here we report that the development of ONJ may involve abnormal phenotypic plasticity of Ly6G+/Gr1+ myeloid cells in the oral barrier tissue undergoing tooth extraction wound healing. A bolus intravenous zoledronate (ZOL) injection to female C57Bl/6 mice followed by maxillary first molar extraction resulted in the development of ONJ-like lesion during the second week of wound healing. The multiplex assay of dissociated oral barrier cells exhibited the secretion of cytokines and chemokines, which was significantly modulated in ZOL mice. Tooth extraction-induced distribution of Ly6G+/Gr1+ cells in the oral barrier tissue increased in ZOL mice at week 2. ONJ-like lesion in ZOL mice contained Ly6G+/Gr1+ cells with abnormal size and morphology as well as different flow cytometric staining intensity. When anti-Ly6G (Gr1) antibody was intraperitoneally injected for 5 days during the second week of tooth extraction, CD11b+GR1hi cells in bone marrow and Ly6G+ cells in the oral barrier tissue were depleted, and the development of ONJ-like lesion was significantly attenuated.

Here, we analyzed the relationship between MYCN amplification (MNA) status and neuroblastoma prognosis. We screened serum samples from 151 patients with NB for MNA, using real-time quantitative PCR, and compared the results with MYCN status determined using paired tumor samples. We additionally investigated whether MNA status correlates with patient survival. When a cut-off value of 5 was used, serum-based MNA analysis was found to show good sensitivity (86%) and very high specificity (95%). The sensitivities for stage 1 and 2 might be acceptable, even though it is not as good as for stage 3 and 4 (67% for stage 1 and 2, 92% for stage 3, and 87% for stage 4). MNA status correlated with overall survival in our cohort of 82 patients, with survival data available (p < 0.01). The hazard ratio of MNA status was 4.98 in patients diagnosed at less than 18 months of age (95% confidence interval, 1.00–24.78), and 1.41 (95% confidence interval, 0.63–3.14) for those diagnosed at 18 months of age or older. Serum-based MNA analysis is rapid and non-invasive compared with tumor-based MNA analysis, and has potential to predict tumor MNA status. There is still a room to improve the sensitivity of the test for tumors of stages 1 and 2, nonetheless this assay might help to determine therapeutic strategies prior to tumor biopsy, especially for patients with a life-threatening condition, as well as for patients of less than 18 months of age whose risk-grouping and treatment allocation depends on their MNA status."
https://openalex.org/W2518362517,"The process of vision is impossible without the photoreceptor cells, which have a unique structure and specific maintenance of cholesterol. Herein we report on the previously unrecognized cholesterol-related pathway in the retina discovered during follow-up characterizations of Cyp27a1−/−Cyp46a1−/− mice. These animals have retinal hypercholesterolemia and convert excess retinal cholesterol into cholesterol esters, normally present in the retina in very small amounts. We established that in the Cyp27a1−/−Cyp46a1−/− retina, cholesterol esters are generated by and accumulate in the photoreceptor outer segments (OS), which is the retinal layer with the lowest cholesterol content. Mouse OS were also found to express the cholesterol-esterifying enzyme acyl-coenzyme A:cholesterol acyltransferase (ACAT1), but not lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT), and to differ from humans in retinal expression of ACAT1. Nevertheless, cholesterol esters were discovered to be abundant in human OS. We suggest a mechanism for cholesterol ester accumulation in the OS and that activity impairment of ACAT1 in humans may underlie the development of subretinal drusenoid deposits, a hallmark of age-related macular degeneration, which is a common blinding disease. We generated Cyp27a1−/−Cyp46a1−/−Acat1−/− mice, characterized their retina by different imaging modalities, and confirmed that unesterified cholesterol does accumulate in their OS and that there is photoreceptor apoptosis and OS degeneration in this line. Our results provide insights into the retinal response to local hypercholesterolemia and the retinal significance of cholesterol esterification, which could be cell-specific and both beneficial and detrimental for retinal structure and function.

These cells are localized exclusively to the retina, a multilayered structure lining the inner surface of the eye. Vertebrate PR cells have a unique polarized morphology that includes the outer segment (OS), formed by stacks of discs responsible for light capture and the transmission of visual signal; the inner segment (IS), rich in mitochondria to provide the cell with energy; the nucleus-containing soma; the axon; and the synaptic terminal (1Swaroop A. Kim D. Forrest D. Transcriptional regulation of photoreceptor development and homeostasis in the mammalian retina.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2010; 11: 563-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). Because PR cells are essential for light perception, their dysfunction affects vision, and their loss due to degeneration causes irreversible blindness (2Jayakody S.A. Gonzalez-Cordero A. Ali R.R. Pearson R.A. Cellular strategies for retinal repair by photoreceptor replacement.Prog. Retin. Eye Res. 2015; 46: 31-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Not only do the PR cells have a unique structure, but they also have very specific maintenance of cholesterol as indicated by the lack of the key proteins of cholesterol biosynthesis, uptake, metabolism, efflux, and regulation (3Zheng W. Reem R.E. Omarova S. Huang S. DiPatre P.L. Charvet C.D. Curcio C.A. Pikuleva I.A.

Hennessey T. Albert A.D. Cholesterol heterogeneity in bovine rod outer segment disk membranes.J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8151-8155Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The reason for such unique maintenance and distribution of cholesterol in the PR cells is currently unknown but could be due to the inhibitory effect of cholesterol on the efficiency of the phototransduction cascade initiated in the OS (7Boesze-Battaglia K.

OS phagocytosis by the RPE could be a factor as well, because it accounts for ∼10% of daily OS renewal (9Bok D. Young R.W. Phagocytic Properties of the Retinal Pigment Epithelium. Harvard University Press, Cambridge, MA1979Google Scholar). Accordingly, the tip of the OS has adapted to contain low cholesterol content to minimize daily retinal cholesterol loss from phagocytosis and the amount of cholesterol that has to be replenished (3Zheng W. Reem R.E. Omarova S. Huang S. DiPatre P.L. Charvet C.D. Curcio C.A. Pikuleva I.A.

Cholesterol maintenance in the retina has been linked to age-related macular degeneration (AMD) (5Pikuleva I.A. Curcio C.A. Cholesterol in the retina: the best is yet to come.Prog. Retin.

These animals have a 1.8- and 2-fold increase in total retinal cholesterol in females and males, respectively, with more than half of this total cholesterol (TC) being esterified. This is very unusual for the neural retina, in which cholesterol is mostly (∼85%) unesterified under normal conditions (29Mast N. Reem R. Bederman I. Huang S. DiPatre P.L. Bjorkhem I. Pikuleva I.A.

Significant cholesterol esterification in the Cyp27a1−/−Cyp46a1−/− retina provided the impetus for the present work, in which we investigated retinal localization and the origin of EC in Cyp27a1−/−Cyp46a1−/− mice. We found that EC is localized mainly in the Cyp27a1−/−Cyp46a1−/− OS, thereby revealing a previously unrecognized, photoreceptor-specific mechanism for handling retinal cholesterol excess. Subsequent investigation of human retinas suggested that the data obtained may be of clinical relevance because they provide novel insight into the biogenesis of SDD, which is only now beginning to be investigated (13Oak A.S.

Normally, EC accounts for only 14% of TC in the retina of female and male mice (Fig. 1A). Yet, in the retina of Cyp27a1−/−Cyp46a1−/− mice, in which TC is increased from 1.8- to 2-fold depending on the gender (Fig. 1A), EC represents from 55% (females) to 76% (males) of TC as established by our previous measurements by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) (27Saadane A.

To localize EC in the Cyp27a1−/−Cyp46a1−/− retina, we used the fluorescent antibiotic filipin, which interacts with the 3β-hydroxyl in EC released by tissue pretreatment with cholesterol esterase (34Castanho M.A. Coutinho A.

As compared with the Cyp27a1+/+Cyp46a1+/+ retina, which showed no fluorescent signal for EC (Fig. 2, A–C), the Cyp27a1−/−Cyp46a1−/− retina had a strong fluorescent signal for EC in the OS and much weaker fluorescent signals in the ganglion cell layer (GCL) and outer plexiform layer (OPL) (Fig. 2, D–F).FIGURE 2.Histochemical detection of retinal EC with filipin. Filipin is a fluorescent antibiotic that interacts with the 3β-hydroxyl group of UC and other sterols. This allows for the visualization of EC after tissue pretreatment with 70% aqueous ethanol to extract UC followed by cholesterol esterase to release the 3β-hydroxyl group in remaining EC. The left section in each panel is a phase contrast image, and the right section is a histochemistry image. A and D, control stains for completeness of UC removal. These sections were extracted with ethanol and treated with filipin. B and E, control stains for background fluorescence.

TC was increased ∼3-fold in the Cyp27a1−/−Cyp46a1−/− PR cells relative to the Cyp27a1+/+Cyp46a1+/+ PR cells (Fig. 3A), a higher TC increase than in the whole retina (1.8–2-fold, Fig. 1A) suggesting that PR cells are a site for cholesterol accumulation in the Cyp27a1−/−Cyp46a1−/− retina. Furthermore, an increase in TC in the Cyp27a1−/−Cyp46a1−/− PR cells was because of an increase in EC, which accounted for 79% of TC in this genotype. For comparison, EC represented only 22% of TC in the Cyp27a1+/+Cyp46a1+/+ PR cells. Thus, sterol quantifications in mouse PR cells confirmed EC detection by histochemistry (Fig. 2F). We then used transmission electron microscopy (TEM) following tannic acid and para-phenylenediamine treatment of the osmicated retina (11Curcio C.A. Millican C.L. Bailey T. Kruth H.S.

Tannic acid preserves the lipids (phospholipids and UC) of vesicular membranes, whereas para-phenylenediamine preserves the lipids (neutral lipids such as EC) in droplets (36Guyton J.R. Klemp K.F.

These accumulations were in the form of droplets of varied size, from 50 to 300 nm in diameter, present inside and outside the PR cells as singlets or in clusters (Fig. 4, B and C). The linear track of droplets in some of the Cyp27a1−/−Cyp46a1−/− OS (Fig. 4D) could indicate that droplets are formed inside the PR cell and are then expelled into the interphotoreceptor space following membrane disruption. Lipid droplets were also found in the Cyp27a1−/−Cyp46a1−/− RPE, cytosol, and phagosomes (Fig. 4, F, H, and I) but in apparently smaller amounts than in the Cyp27a1−/−Cyp46a1−/− OS. Unlike the OS, the Cyp27a1−/−Cyp46a1−/− RPE contained large semi-electron-lucent areas with content, which included phagosomes, vesicular membranes, and membranous debris (Fig. 4, F, G, and I). Because EC was not detectable in the Cyp27a1−/−Cyp46a1−/− RPE by filipin (Fig. 2F), and we had found previously that the Cyp27a1−/−Cyp46a1−/− RPE may contain focal deposits of UC (27Saadane A.

Studies by TEM are supported by our previous light microscopy stains with oil red O, a dye that interacts mainly with neutral lipids and fatty acids. As found from analysis by TEM, the oil red O stains also revealed lipid accumulation in the Cyp27a1−/−Cyp46a1−/− photoreceptors (27Saadane A. Mast N. Charvet C.D. Omarova S. Zheng W. Huang S.S.

https://openalex.org/W2514381096,"Background Phenylketonuria (PKU) is due to a defective hepatic enzyme, phenylalanine (Phe) hydroxylase. Transport of the precursor amino acids from blood into the brain for serotonin and dopamine synthesis is reported to be inhibited by high blood Phe concentrations. Deficiencies of serotonin and dopamine are involved in neurocognitive dysfunction in PKU. Objective (1) To evaluate the effects of sapropterin (BH4) and concurrent use of large neutral amino acids (LNAA) on the peripheral biomarkers, melatonin and dopamine with the hypothesis they reflect brain serotonin and dopamine metabolism. (2) To evaluate synergistic effects with BH4 and LNAA. (3) To determine the effects of blood Phe concentrations on the peripheral biomarkers concentrations. Methods Nine adults with PKU completed our study consisting of four 4-week phases: (1) LNAA supplementation, (2) Washout, (3) BH4 therapy, and (4) LNAA with BH4 therapy. An overnight protocol measured plasma amino acids, serum melatonin, and 6-sulfatoxymelatonin and dopamine in first void urine after each phase. Results (1) Three out of nine subjects responded to BH4. A significant increase of serum melatonin levels was observed in BH4 responders with decreased blood Phe concentration. No significant change in melatonin, dopamine or Phe levels was observed with BH4 in the subjects as a whole. (2) Synergistic effects with BH4 and LNAA were observed in serum melatonin in BH4 responders. (3) The relationship between serum melatonin and Phe showed a significant negative slope (p = 0.0005) with a trend toward differing slopes among individual subjects (p = 0.066). There was also a negative association overall between blood Phe and urine 6-sulfatoxymelatonin and dopamine (P = 0.040 and 0.047). Conclusion Blood Phe concentrations affected peripheral monoamine neurotransmitter biomarker concentrations differently in each individual with PKU. Melatonin levels increased with BH4 therapy only when blood Phe decreased. Monitoring peripheral neurotransmitter metabolites may assist in optimizing individualized treatment in PKU."
https://openalex.org/W2515668542,"It is well known that the ubiquitin-proteasome system is activated in response to skeletal muscle wasting and functions to degrade contractile proteins. The loss of these proteins inevitably reduces skeletal muscle size (i.e., quantity). However, it is currently unknown whether activation of this pathway also affects function by impairing the muscle’s intrinsic ability to produce force (i.e., quality). Therefore, the purpose of this study was twofold, (1) document how the ubiquitin-proteasome system responds to denervation and (2) identify the physiological consequences of these changes. To induce soleus muscle atrophy, C57BL6 mice underwent tibial nerve transection of the left hindlimb for 7 or 14 days (n = 6–8 per group). At these time points, content of several proteins within the ubiquitin-proteasome system were determined via Western blot, while ex vivo whole muscle contractility was specifically analyzed at day 14. Denervation temporarily increased several key proteins within the ubiquitin-proteasome system, including the E3 ligase MuRF1 and the proteasome subunits 19S, α7 and β5. These changes were accompanied by reductions in absolute peak force and power, which were offset when expressed relative to physiological cross-sectional area. Contrary to peak force, absolute and relative forces at submaximal stimulation frequencies were significantly greater following 14 days of denervation. Taken together, these data represent two keys findings. First, activation of the ubiquitin-proteasome system is associated with reductions in skeletal muscle quantity rather than quality. Second, shortly after denervation, it appears the muscle remodels to compensate for the loss of neural activity via changes in Ca2+ handling."

Mouse models of CCM disease have been established by deleting Ccm genes in postnatal animals. These mouse models provide invaluable tools to investigate molecular mechanism and therapeutic approaches for CCM disease. However, the full value of these animal models is limited by the lack of an accurate and quantitative method to assess lesion burden and progression. In the present study we have established a refined and detailed contrast enhanced X-ray micro-CT method to measure CCM lesion burden in mouse brains. As this study utilized a voxel dimension of 9.5μm (leading to a minimum feature size of approximately 25μm), it is therefore sufficient to measure CCM lesion volume and number globally and accurately, and provide high-resolution 3-D mapping of CCM lesions in mouse brains. Using this method, we found loss of Ccm1 or Ccm2 in neonatal endothelium confers CCM lesions in the mouse hindbrain with similar total volume and number. This quantitative approach also demonstrated a rescue of CCM lesions with simultaneous deletion of one allele of Mekk3. This method would enhance the value of the established mouse models to study the molecular basis and potential therapies for CCM and other cerebrovascular diseases."

However, little is known about factors that predict maternal loss to HIV care in the postpartum year. This retrospective cohort study included 980 HIV-positive women, diagnosed with HIV at least one year before pregnancy, who had a live birth during 2008–2010 in New York State. Women who did not meet the following criterion in the 12 months after the delivery-related hospital discharge were considered to be lost to HIV care: two or more laboratory tests (CD4 or HIV viral load), separated by at least 90 days. Adjusted relative risks (aRR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for predictors of postpartum loss to HIV care were identified with Poisson regression, solved using generalized estimating equations. Having an unsuppressed (>200 copies/mL) HIV viral load in the postpartum year was also evaluated. Overall, 24% of women were loss to HIV care during the postpartum year. Women with low participation in HIV care during preconception were more likely to be lost to HIV care during the postpartum year (aRR: 2.70; 95% CI: 2.09–3.49). In contrast, having a low birth weight infant was significantly associated with a decreased likelihood of loss to HIV care (aRR: 0.72; 95% CI: 0.53–0.98). While 75% of women were virally suppressed at the last viral load before delivery only 44% were continuously suppressed in the postpartum year; 12% had no viral load test reported in the postpartum year and 44% had at least one unsuppressed viral load test. Lack of engagement in preconception HIV-related health care predicts postpartum loss to HIV care for HIV-positive parturient women. Many women had poor viral control during the postpartum period, increasing the risk of disease progression and infectivity."

https://openalex.org/W2510321611,"The Arabidopsis protein FPA controls flowering time by regulating the alternative 3'-end processing of the FLOWERING LOCUS (FLC) antisense RNA. FPA belongs to the split ends (SPEN) family of proteins, which contain N-terminal RNA recognition motifs (RRMs) and a SPEN paralog and ortholog C-terminal (SPOC) domain. The SPOC domain is highly conserved among FPA homologs in plants, but the conservation with the domain in other SPEN proteins is much lower. We have determined the crystal structure of Arabidopsis thaliana FPA SPOC domain at 2.7 Å resolution. The overall structure is similar to that of the SPOC domain in human SMRT/HDAC1 Associated Repressor Protein (SHARP), although there are also substantial conformational differences between them. Structural and sequence analyses identify a surface patch that is conserved among plant FPA homologs. Mutations of two residues in this surface patch did not disrupt FPA functions, suggesting that either the SPOC domain is not required for the role of FPA in regulating RNA 3'-end formation or the functions of the FPA SPOC domain cannot be disrupted by the combination of mutations, in contrast to observations with the SHARP SPOC domain."
https://openalex.org/W2515701675,"The role of contaminated preservation fluid in the development of infection after liver transplantation has not been fully elucidated. To assess the incidence and etiology of contaminated preservation fluid and determine its impact on the subsequent development of infection after liver transplantation, we prospectively studied 50 consecutive liver transplants, and cultured the following samples in each instance: preservation fluid (immediately before and at the end of the back-table procedure, and just before implantation), blood, and bile from the donor, and ascitic fluid from the recipient. When any culture was positive, blood cultures were obtained and targeted antimicrobial therapy was started. We found that the incidence of contaminated preservation fluid was 92% (46 of 50 cases of liver transplantation per year), but only 28% (14/50) were contaminated by recognized pathogens. Blood and bile cultures from the donor were positive in 28% and 6% respectively, whereas ascitic fluid was positive in 22%. The most frequently isolated microorganisms were coagulase-negative staphylococci. In nine cases, the microorganisms isolated from the preservation fluid concurred with those grown from the donor blood cultures, and in one case, the isolate matched with the one obtained from bile culture. No liver transplant recipient developed an infection due to the transmission of an organism isolated from the preservation fluid. Our findings indicate that contamination of the preservation fluid is frequent in liver transplantation, and it is mainly caused by saprophytic skin flora. Transmission of infection is low, particularly among those recipients given targeted antimicrobial treatment for organisms isolated in the preservation fluid."
https://openalex.org/W2510305868,"Carbonic anhydrase IX (CAIX) is a tumor-specific protein that is upregulated during hypoxic conditions where it is involved in maintaining the pH balance. CAIX causes extracellular acidification, thereby limiting the uptake of weak basic chemotherapeutic agents, such as doxorubicin, and decreasing its efficacy. The aim of this study was to determine if doxorubicin efficacy can be increased when combined with the selective sulfamate CAIX inhibitor S4. The effect of S4 on doxorubicin efficacy was tested in vitro using cell viability assays with MDA-MB-231, FaDu, HT29 –CAIX high and HT29 –CAIX low cell lines. In addition, the efficacy of this combination therapy was investigated in tumor xenografts of the same cell lines. The addition of S4 in vitro increased the efficacy of doxorubicin in the MDA-MB-231 during hypoxic exposure (IC50 is 0.25 versus 0.14 µM, p = 0.0003). Similar results were observed for HT29—CAIX high with S4 during normoxia (IC50 is 0.20 versus 0.08 µM, p<0.0001) and in the HT29 –CAIX low cells (IC50 is 0.09 µM, p<0.0001). In vivo doxorubicin treatment was only effective in the MDA-MB-231 xenografts, but the efficacy of doxorubicin was decreased when combined with S4. In conclusion, the efficacy of doxorubicin treatment can be increased when combined with the selective sulfamate CAIX inhibitor S4 in vitro in certain cell lines. Nevertheless, in xenografts S4 did not enhance doxorubicin efficacy in the FaDu and HT29 tumor models and decreased doxorubicin efficacy in the MDA-MB-231 tumor model. These results stress the importance of better understanding the role of CAIX inhibitors in intratumoral pH regulation before combining them with standard treatment modalities, such as doxorubicin."
https://openalex.org/W2515481325,"Objectives Occupational groups exposed to high occupational physical activity have an increased risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD). This may be explained by the high relative aerobic workload. Enhanced cardiorespiratory fitness reduces the relative aerobic workload. Thus, the aim was to evaluate the 12-months effects of worksite aerobic exercise on risk factors for CVD among cleaners. Methods One hundred and sixteen cleaners aged 18–65 years were randomized to a group performing aerobic exercise and a reference group receiving lectures. Outcomes were collected at baseline and after 12-months. A repeated measures 2×2 multi-adjusted mixed-model design was applied to compare the between-group differences using intention-to-treat analysis. Results Between-group differences (p<0.05) were found favouring the aerobic exercise group: cardiorespiratory fitness 2.15 (SE 1.03) mlO2/min/kg, aerobic workload -2.15 (SE 1.06) %HRR, resting HR -5.31 (SE 1.61) beats/min, high sensitive C-reactive protein -0.65 (SE 0.24) μg/ml. The blood pressure was unaltered. Stratified analyses on relative aerobic workload at baseline revealed that those with relative aerobic workloads ≥30% of HRR seems to impose a notable adverse effect on resting and ambulatory blood pressure. Conclusion This long-term worksite aerobic exercise intervention among cleaners led to several beneficial effects, but also potential adverse effects among those with high relative aerobic workloads.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the influence of HLA-G allelic variants and serum soluble HLA-G (sHLA-G) levels on risk of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). We analyzed 191 Caucasian adults with NSCLC and 191 healthy subjects recruited between January 2009 and March 2014 in Ariana (Tunisia). Serum sHLA-G levels were measured by immunoassay and HLA-G alleles were determined using a direct DNA sequencing procedures. The heterozygous genotypes of HLA-G 010101 and -G 010401 were associated with increased risks of both NSCLC and advanced disease stages. In contrast, the heterozygous genotypes of HLA-G 0105N and -G 0106 were associated with decreased risks of NSCC and clinical disease stage IV, respectively. Serum sHLA-G levels were significantly higher in patients with NSCLC and particularly in those with advanced disease stages compared to healthy subjects. The area under the receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curves was 0.82 for controls vs patients. Given 100% specificity, the highest sensitivity achieved to detect NSCLC was 52.8% at a cutoff value of 24.9 U/ml. Patients with the sHLA-G above median level (≥ 50 U/ml) had a significantly shorter survival time. This study demonstrates that HLA-G allelic variants are independent risk factors for NSCLC. Serum sHLA-G levels in NSCLC patients could be useful biomarkers for the diagnostic and prognosis of NSCLC."
https://openalex.org/W2509850314,"Recent studies have reported increases of methylglyoxal (MGO) in peritoneal dialysis patients, and that MGO-mediated inflammation plays an important role in the development of peritoneal fibrosis through production of transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1). Linagliptin, a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor, exerts anti-inflammatory effects independent of blood glucose levels. In this study, we examined whether linagliptin suppresses MGO-induced peritoneal fibrosis in mice. Male C57/BL6 mice were divided into three groups: control, MGO injection plus saline, and MGO injection plus linagliptin (n = 6 per group). Peritoneal fibrosis was induced by daily intraperitoneal injection of saline containing 40 mmol/L MGO for 21 days. Saline was administered intraperitoneally to the control group. Linagliptin (10 mg/kg) or saline were administrated by once-daily oral gavage from 3 weeks before starting MGO injections. Immunohistochemical staining revealed that linagliptin suppressed expression of α-smooth muscle actin and fibroblast-specific protein-1, deposition of type I and III collagen, and macrophage (F4/80) infiltration. Peritoneal equilibration testing showed improved peritoneal functions in mice treated with linagliptin. Peritoneal injection of MGO increased plasma levels of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) in mice, and a further increase was observed in linagliptin-treated mice. Although MGO increased plasma glucose levels, linagliptin did not decrease plasma glucose levels. Moreover, linagliptin reduced the TGF-β1 concentration in the peritoneal fluid of MGO-treated mice. GLP-1 receptor (GLP-1R) was expressed in monocytes/macrophages and linagliptin suppressed GLP-1R expression in MGO-injected mice. These results suggest that oral administration of linagliptin ameliorates MGO-induced peritoneal fibrosis."

In particular, the native Chamorro people living in the island of Guam were exposed to BMAA by consuming a diet based on the cycad seeds. Carbamylated forms of BMAA are glutamate analogues. The mechanism of neurotoxicity of the BMAA is not completely understood, and BMAA acting as a glutamate receptor agonist may lead to excitotoxicity that interferes with glutamate transport systems. Though the interaction of BMAA with bicarbonate is known to produce carbamate adducts, here we demonstrate that BMAA and its primary and secondary adducts coexist in solution and undergoes a chemical exchange among them. Furthermore, we determined the rates of formation/cleavage of the carbamate adducts under equilibrium conditions using two-dimensional proton exchange NMR spectroscopy (EXSY). The coexistence of the multiple forms of BMAA at physiological conditions adds to the complexity of the mechanisms by which BMAA functions as a neurotoxin."
https://openalex.org/W2518115640,"The marine snail Littorina saxatilis exhibits extreme morphological variation between and within geographical regions and represents an excellent model for assessing local adaptation. Previous studies support the hypothesis of parallel evolution in sympatry of two morphologically different ecotypes (named as RB and SU) that co-inhabit different habitats from Galician rocky shores (NW Spain), and which are interrupted by sheltered areas inhabited by a different morph never studied before (named as SRB). Here, we use morphological and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequence data to test hypotheses on the origin and diversification of SRB snails and to assess their evolutionary relationships with RB and SU ecotypes. Our results show that the SRB morph displays the largest size and shell elongation and the smallest relative shell aperture, representing an extreme type of the RB vs. SU polymorphism, which has been linked to adaptation to sheltered ecological factors. Phylogenetic analysis shows that the SRB morph shares ancestry with RB and SU ecotypes, rejecting the hypothesis that the SRB morph marks relict populations from which these ecotypes evolved in Galician coasts. Our data support that genetic differentiation among SRB, RB and SU morphs results from a general pattern of restricted gene flow and isolation by distance linked to the colonization of Galician coasts by two independent mtDNA lineages, rather than from a random fragmentation of the initial distributional range. Therefore, the confinement of distinct lineages to specific geographical areas denote evident limits to the distances these snails can disperse. Morphological analysis indicates no association between mtDNA lineage and a specific morphotype, and suggests the independent gain of convergent morphological patterns within each mtDNA lineage in populations occupying contrasting habitats following the colonization of Galician coasts."
https://openalex.org/W2509386249,"The settling velocities of natural, synthetic, and industrial particles were measured in a grid turbulence facility using optical measurement techniques. Particle image velocimetry and 2D particle tracking were used to measure the instantaneous velocities of the flow and the particles' trajectories simultaneously. We find that for particles examined in this study (Rep = 0.4-123), settling velocity is either enhanced or unchanged relative to stagnant flow for the range of investigated turbulence conditions. The smallest particles' normalized settling velocities exhibited the most consistent trends when plotted versus the Kolmogorov-based Stokes numbers suggesting that the dissipative scales influence their dynamics. In contrast, the mid-sized particles were better characterized with a Stokes number based on the integral time scale. The largest particles were largely unaffected by the flow conditions. Using proper orthogonal decomposition (POD), the flow pattern scales are compared to particle trajectory curvature to complement results obtained through dimensional analysis using Stokes numbers. The smallest particles are found to have trajectories with curvatures of similar scale as the small flow scales (higher POD modes) whilst mid-sized particle trajectories had curvatures that were similar to the larger flow patterns (lower POD modes). The curvature trajectories of the largest particles did not correspond to any particular flow pattern scale suggesting that their trajectories were more random. These results provide experimental evidence of the ""fast tracking"" theory of settling velocity enhancement in turbulence and demonstrate that particles align themselves with flow scales in proportion to their size."

The objective of this study was to evaluate the early effects of the P4P program on utilization of preventive services by HBV and HCV patients.Using a quasi-experimental design with propensity score matching method, we matched the HBV and HCV patients enrolled in the P4P program with non-enrollees in 2010, resulting in 21,643 patients in each group. Generalized estimating equations was applied to examine the difference-in-difference effects of P4P program enrollment on the utilization of three guideline-recommended preventive services (regular outpatient follow-up visits, abdominal ultrasonography (US) examinations, and aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase (AST/ALT) tests by HBV and HCV patients.The P4P program enrollees were significantly more likely to attend twice-annual follow-up visits, to receive recommended US examinations and AST/ALT tests, than non-enrollees.The results of our preliminary assessment indicate that financial incentives offered by the P4P program was associated with a modest improvement in adherence to guidelines for better chronic HBV and HBC management."

In the current work, we first modified the micropattern geometry to improve cell viability and then studied the axon length from 2 to 7 days in vitro (DIV). The cell types of neurons were evaluated retrospectively based on immunoreactivity against GAD67, a marker for inhibitory GABAergic neurons. We found that axons of non-GABAergic neurons grow significantly longer than those of GABAergic neurons in the early stages of development. The optimal threshold for identifying GABAergic and non-GABAergic neurons was evaluated to be 110 μm at 6 DIV. The method does not require any fluorescence labelling and can be carried out on live cells. The accuracy of identification was 98.2%. We confirmed that the high accuracy was due to the use of a micropattern, which standardized the development of cultured neurons. The method promises to be beneficial both for engineering neuronal networks in vitro and for basic cellular neuroscience research."

Transcranial Doppler ultrasound (TCD) is a powerful predictor of stroke in the pediatric sickle cell disease population, as demonstrated in the STOP trial. Our study was conducted to determine the prediction value of peak systolic velocities as measured by TCD on subsequent stroke risk in a prospective cohort of the general population from Beijing, China.In 2002, a prospective cohort study was conducted among 1392 residents from 11 villages of the Shijingshan district of Beijing, China. The cohort was scheduled for follow up with regard to incident stroke in 2005, 2007, and 2012 by a study team comprised of epidemiologists, nurses, and physicians. Univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression models were used to determine the factors associated with incident stroke.Participants identified by TCD criteria as having intracranial stenosis had a 3.6-fold greater risk of incident stroke (hazard ratio (HR) 3.57, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.86-6.83, P<0.01) than those without TCD evidence of intracranial stenosis. The association remained significant in multivariate analysis (HR 2.53, 95% CI 1.31-4.87) after adjusting for other risk factors or confounders. Older age, cigarette smoking, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus remained statistically significant as risk factors after controlling for other factors.The study confirmed the screening value of TCD among the general population in urban China. Increasing the availability of TCD screening may help identify subjects as higher risk for stroke."
https://openalex.org/W2514301943,"The DEM generalization is the basis of multi-dimensional observation, the basis of expressing and analyzing the terrain. DEM is also the core of building the Multi-Scale Geographic Database. Thus, many researchers have studied both the theory and the method of DEM generalization. This paper proposed a new method of generalizing terrain, which extracts feature points based on the tree model construction which considering the nested relationship of watershed characteristics. The paper used the 5 m resolution DEM of the Jiuyuan gully watersheds in the Loess Plateau as the original data and extracted the feature points in every single watershed to reconstruct the DEM. The paper has achieved generalization from 1:10000 DEM to 1:50000 DEM by computing the best threshold. The best threshold is 0.06. In the last part of the paper, the height accuracy of the generalized DEM is analyzed by comparing it with some other classic methods, such as aggregation, resample, and VIP based on the original 1:50000 DEM. The outcome shows that the method performed well. The method can choose the best threshold according to the target generalization scale to decide the density of the feature points in the watershed. Meanwhile, this method can reserve the skeleton of the terrain, which can meet the needs of different levels of generalization. Additionally, through overlapped contour contrast, elevation statistical parameters and slope and aspect analysis, we found out that the W8D algorithm performed well and effectively in terrain representation."
https://openalex.org/W2513021146,"Incomprehension and denial of the theory of evolution among high school students has been observed to also occur when teachers are not equipped to deliver a compelling case also for human evolution based on fossil evidence. This paper assesses the outcomes of a novel inquiry-based paleoanthropology lab teaching human evolution to high-school students. The inquiry-based Be a Paleoanthropologist for a Day lab placed a dozen hominin skulls into the hands of high-school students. Upon measuring three variables of human evolution, students explain what they have observed and discuss findings. In the 2013/14 school year, 11 biology classes in 7 schools in the Greater New Orleans area participated in this lab. The interviewed teacher cohort unanimously agreed that the lab featuring hominin skull replicas and stimulating student inquiry was a pedagogically excellent method of delivering the subject of human evolution. First, the lab's learning path of transforming facts to data, information to knowledge, and knowledge to acceptance empowered students to themselves execute part of the science that underpins our understanding of deep time hominin evolution. Second, although challenging, the hands-on format of the lab was accessible to high-school students, most of whom were readily able to engage the lab's scientific process. Third, the lab's exciting and compelling pedagogy unlocked higher order thinking skills, effectively activating the cognitive, psychomotor and affected learning domains as defined in Bloom's taxonomy. Lastly, the lab afforded students a formative experience with a high degree of retention and epistemic depth. Further study is warranted to gauge the degree of these effects."
https://openalex.org/W2513302822,"To construct and validate a prediction model for individual combined benefit and harm outcomes (stroke with no major bleeding, major bleeding with no stroke, neither event, or both) in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) with and without warfarin therapy.Using the Kaiser Permanente Colorado databases, we included patients newly diagnosed with AF between January 1, 2005 and December 31, 2012 for model construction and validation. The primary outcome was a prediction model of composite of stroke or major bleeding using polytomous logistic regression (PLR) modelling. The secondary outcome was a prediction model of all-cause mortality using the Cox regression modelling.We included 9074 patients with 4537 and 4537 warfarin users and non-users, respectively. In the derivation cohort (n = 4632), there were 136 strokes (2.94%), 280 major bleedings (6.04%) and 1194 deaths (25.78%) occurred. In the prediction models, warfarin use was not significantly associated with risk of stroke, but increased the risk of major bleeding and decreased the risk of death. Both the PLR and Cox models were robust, internally and externally validated, and with acceptable model performances.In this study, we introduce a new methodology for predicting individual combined benefit and harm outcomes associated with warfarin therapy for patients with AF. Should this approach be validated in other patient populations, it has potential advantages over existing risk stratification approaches as a patient-physician aid for shared decision-making."
https://openalex.org/W2509536308,"The relation between physical stimuli and neurophysiological responses, such as action potentials (spikes) and Local Field Potentials (LFP), has recently been experimented in order to explain how neurons encode auditory information. However, none of these experiments presented analyses with postsynaptic potentials (PSPs). In the present study, we have estimated information values between auditory stimuli and amplitudes/latencies of PSPs and LFPs in anesthetized rats in vivo. To obtain these values, a new method of information estimation was used. This method produced more accurate estimates than those obtained by using the traditional binning method; a fact that was corroborated by simulated data. The traditional binning method could not certainly impart such accuracy even when adjusted by quadratic extrapolation. We found that the information obtained from LFP amplitude variation was significantly greater than the information obtained from PSP amplitude variation. This confirms the fact that LFP reflects the action of many PSPs. Results have shown that the auditory cortex codes more information of stimuli frequency with slow oscillations in groups of neurons than it does with slow oscillations in neurons separately."
https://openalex.org/W2517512988,"Signaling networks are made up of limited numbers of molecules and yet can code information that controls different cellular states through temporal patterns and a combination of signaling molecules. In this study, we used a data-driven modeling approach, the Laguerre filter with partial least square regression, to describe how temporal and combinatorial patterns of signaling molecules are decoded by their downstream targets. The Laguerre filter is a time series model used to represent a nonlinear system based on Volterra series expansion. Furthermore, with this approach, each component of the Volterra series expansion is expanded by Laguerre basis functions. We combined two approaches, application of a Laguerre filter and partial least squares (PLS) regression, and applied the combined approach to analysis of a signal transduction network. We applied the Laguerre filter with PLS regression to identify input and output (IO) relationships between MAP kinases and the products of immediate early genes (IEGs). We found that Laguerre filter with PLS regression performs better than Laguerre filter with ordinary regression for the reproduction of a time series of IEGs. Analysis of the nonlinear characteristics extracted using the Laguerre filter revealed a priming effect of ERK and CREB on c-FOS induction. Specifically, we found that the effects of a first pulse of ERK enhance the subsequent effects on c-FOS induction of treatment with a second pulse of ERK, a finding consistent with prior molecular biological knowledge. The variable importance of projections and output loadings in PLS regression predicted the upstream dependency of each IEG. Thus, a Laguerre filter with partial least square regression approach appears to be a powerful method to find the processing mechanism of temporal patterns and combination of signaling molecules by their downstream gene expression."
