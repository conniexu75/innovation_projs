https://openalex.org/W1564990229,"Abstract The turnover of various constituents of the membranes of the endoplasmic reticulum has been measured by injecting 14C-leucine and 14C-acetate, or in some cases 14C-leucine and 14C-glycerol, into a series of 12 to 15 rats (weighing 150 to 200 g). At various times, up to 2 weeks after injection, three rats were killed, their livers were pooled, microsomes were obtained and divided into rough and smooth fractions, and purified membranes were isolated from each fraction. The constituents examined were the following: total membrane proteins; two specific membrane components, purified reduced-NADP: ferricytochrome c oxidoreductase and purified cytochrome b5; total membrane lipids; and the nonpolar (fatty acid) and polar (glycerol backbone) moieties of the lipid. The two enzymes were purified 100- to 150-fold by trypsin digestion of KCl-washed microsomes, followed by chromatography on Sephadex G-100 and diethylaminoethyl cellulose. The purity of both proteins was close to 100%, in yields of 25 to 35% from original microsomes. Both total proteins and total lipids of rough microsomal membranes had the same half-lives as their counterparts from smooth microsomal membranes. In the various experiments, the total membrane proteins had half-lives of from 75 to 113 hours, while in the same experiments, total membrane lipids have 10 to 30% shorter half-lives. The half-life of the NADPH-cytochrome c reductase was, in two experiments, almost exactly that of total membrane proteins, while the half-life of cytochrome b5 was significantly (about 50%) longer. The polar and nonpolar components of the lipids had different apparent half-lives, that of fatty acids being much longer than that of the glycerol backbone. The longer half-life of fatty acids may be connected with the presumed presence of transacylating enzymes in microsomal membranes. The results are discussed in relation to current concepts on membrane structure and biogenesis."

The polymeric substance is insoluble in lipid solvents and can be degraded by periodate. Fractionation studies and chemical analyses suggest that choline is linked to a polysaccharide component of pneumococcal cell wall."
https://openalex.org/W1500057643,"The explosive accumulation of tyrosine aminotransferase that normally occurs in rats at birth has been brought about prematurely by a single administration of glucagon to fetuses. Serine dehydratase is also found to accumulate normally after birth, but glucagon initiates its formation prenatally. The glucose-6-phosphatase activity of liver, which begins to develop just before birth, has been prematurely increased in fetuses by glucagon. The administration of hydrocortisone is without effect on the prenatal development of these three enzymes. The results suggest that glucagon may exert an important physiological function in the rat during the time of major developmental change in carbohydrate metabolism. The administration of glucose inhibits the early postnatal accumulation of tyrosine aminotransferase and serine dehydratase during the first 6 to 8 hours after birth. The results are consistent with the possibility that under normal conditions the decrease in blood glucose, upon cessation of the placental supply at birth, stimulates the secretion of glucagon, which then triggers the formation of tyrosine aminotransferase and serine dehydratase."

https://openalex.org/W1669877415,"Abstract A simple chemical method of reducing biopterin to 7,8-dihydrobiopterin has been described. The product of this reaction appears to be identical with the phenylalanine hydroxylation cofactor isolated from rat liver extracts. With the use of the synthetic compound, the TPNH-mediated enzymatic reduction of dihydrobiopterin to the tetrahydro level has been demonstrated. This reduction is catalyzed by dihydrofolate reductase. In the presence of 7,8-dihydrobiopterin, the reductase is an essential component of the phenylalanine-hydroxylating system. The TPN-dependent oxidation of dihydrobiopterin to sepiapterin has been shown to be catalyzed by another enzyme, sepiapterin reductase."

https://openalex.org/W1497806200,"Abstract Mature and immature rat brain mitochondria exhibit marked differences in the rates of oxygen consumption and phosphorylation with dl-β-hydroxybutyrate as substrate. Directly assayed dl-β-hydroxybutyric dehydrogenase activity is 3 to 4 times greater at 15 days than at 180 days of age. This difference is observed also in mitochondrial preparations that have undergone sonic oscillation and is maintained at saturating levels of NAD+. Mixtures of sonically disrupted mitochondria from mature and immature brain exhibit completely additive enzyme activities. The high activity in the immature brain mitochondria has been found to be specific for d(-)-β-hydroxybutyrate. Brain β-hydroxybutyric dehydrogenase activity is low in the immediate postnatal period, rises together with cytochrome oxidase during the first 30 days of life, and then, in contrast to cytochrome oxidase, progressively falls again to the low level of adult brain. The enzyme activity is, therefore, maximal during the period of most rapid growth and maturation of the brain."
https://openalex.org/W2046544884,"Tyrosine alpha ketoglutarate transaminase, which is rapidly induced by various agents, shows circadian rhythmicity in the intact rat. This rhythmicity is only slightly altered after adrenalectomy, indicating that adrenal hormones do not play a major role in the metabolic control of the activity of tyrosine alpha ketoglutarate transaminase. On the other hand, phenylalaninepyruvate transaminase, which is not inducible over the same time period, does not show circadian variation. The results suggest that the sensitivity of an enzyme's regulating system to inducing agents may be related to the inherent circadian rhythm of the enzyme."

https://openalex.org/W1523289503,"Abstract Rabbit heart mitochondria have a very active fatty acid-synthetic system. The system has a much greater capacity than similarly isolated mitochondria from liver or kidney, and is presumed to have special functional significance for heart. The system yields a mixture of products: shorter (12 to 16 carbon atoms) chain fatty acids are synthesized de novo from acetate, and longer chain fatty acids result from the elongation of preformed acyl units. Evidence is presented that the rate of synthesis is controlled by the NADH:NAD+ ratio and that stimulation of synthesis by Krebs cycle acids only occurs when there is a marked increase in the ratio. Succinate has an extraordinary capacity to stimulate the system, and the mechanism by which this is accomplished is via reversed electron flow. This, therefore, is an important physiological role of reversed electron flow from succinate. When the NADH:NAD+ ratio decreases rapidly, such as in State 3, fatty acid oxidation commences, including oxidation of the recently synthesized fatty acids. It is postulated that the synthetic system is the reversal of the oxidation process and that there is present, therefore, a fatty acid oxidation-synthesis cycle. The rate of activity of this cycle in either direction is controlled by the NADH:NAD+ ratio. On the basis of the present experiments, the concept has been developed that the mitochondrial fatty acid-synthetic pathway represents a storage form of acetyl units during the development of debt. When oxygen is again readily available, these acetyl units are oxidized to yield energy."
https://openalex.org/W1526568016,"An enzyme which catalyzes the oxidation of methylglyoxal to pyruvic acid was partially purified from aqueous extracts of sheep liver acetone powders. NAD+ or NADP+ was necessary for the oxidation. Changes in methylglyoxal, pyruvate, and pyridine nucleotide were stoichiometrically equivalent. Of various carbonyl-containing compounds tested, only α-keto aldehydes were substrates. Enzyme activity was found only in the supernatant fraction of liver cells. Evidence is presented that the conversion of methylglyoxal to pyruvate was direct and did not involve its preliminary conversion to lactate. Activity increased up to pH 10.4 with no indication of a pH optimum. Km values for methylglyoxal with respect to NADP+ were smaller than with respect to NAD+. The ratio of rates of NAD+ to NADP+ reduction varied with the nature of the substrate and type of inhibitor. The name α-keto aldehyde dehydrogenase is suggested. The possible function of this new enzyme activity is discussed in relation to the suggested origins and physiological functions of methylglyoxal."
https://openalex.org/W47274048,"The diterpenoid metabolites ( — )-kauren-19-al (III) and ( — )-kauren-19-oic acid (IV) have been identified as products of mevalonate metabolism in an endosperm homogenate of Echinocystis macrocarpa Greene (wild cucumber). These products are formed in addition to ( — )-kaurene (I) and ( — )-kauren-19-ol (II), which were identified earlier. The evidence indicates that kaurene is oxidized irreversibly to kaurenol, kaurenal, kaurenoic acid, and a mixture of at least four other unidentified acids, in that sequence, in endosperm homogenates. These reactions are localized in the microsomal pellet and require the addition of either a reduced pyridine nucleotide or a heated 105,000 x g supernatant fraction. The microsomal oxidations of kaurene to kaurenol and of kaurenol to kaurenal require air as well as a reduced pyridine nucleotide, with reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate more effective than NADH. NADP+, NAD+, or flavin adenine dinucleotide could not serve as a coenzyme under either aerobic or anaerobic conditions. The conversion of kaurenol to kaurenal was inhibited by NADP+, p-chloromercuribenzoate, and β-diethylaminoethyldiphenylvalerate dihydrochloride (SKF 525-A). These properties suggest that both reactions are catalyzed by mixed function oxidases. 14C-Kaurenal was incorporated into gibberellic acid in washed suspensions of Fusarium moniliforme cells. This finding, and similar results for kaurene, kaurenol, and kaurenoic acid reported earlier, indicates an intermediate role for all these substances in gibberellin biosynthesis. The general implications of these results for gibberellin biosynthesis are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1989817295,"There is a maintained electrical potential of 15 to 40 millivolts across the two epithelial layers forming the body wall of Hydra, the inside of the animal being positive. Negativegoing (depolarizing) spikes are recorded spontaneously and sometimes in response to depolarizing current pulses. These spikes usually overshoot the zero potential level. The large size of the spikes and the orientation of the potential difference across the body wall indicate that this electrical activity is epithelial rather than nervous in origin."

https://openalex.org/W1965679177,The concentration of tyrosine in the plasma of normal males varies diurnally. It is lowest (9.5 +/- 0.35 micrograms per milliliter) between 0130 and 0230 hours and rises to a peak of 16.2 +/- 0.82 micrograms per milliliter by 1030 hours. This rhythm persists when subjects are maintained for 2 weeks on a diet that is very low in protein.
https://openalex.org/W1600517271,"Abstract The d-amino acid oxidase-catalyzed conversion of d-phenylglycine to benzoylformic acid can be followed spectrophotometrically by measuring the increase in optical density at 252 mµ which accompanies this reaction. Various properties of this d-phenylglycine reaction were studied, and conditions are given for the application of this reaction as a spectrophotometric assay of d-amino acid oxidase. Several previously established properties of d-amino acid oxidase were redetermined with the spectrophotometric method, and the results obtained were in good agreement with those previously observed with other assay methods. The spectrophotometric method was used to study the binding of pyridine carboxylic acid derivatives to the enzyme. The three isomeric pyridine carboxylic acids and N-methyl-nicotinic acid effectively inhibit d-amino acid oxidase, and the inhibition observed was in each case competitive with respect to substrate. Inhibitor dissociation constants are listed for the derivatives studied."
https://openalex.org/W1506464883,"Abstract Initial velocities of the reaction catalyzed by the ribonucleotide reductase of Lactobacillus leichmannii have been measured spectrophotometrically in the presence of various combinations of cobamide coenzymes, ribonucleoside triphosphate substrates, deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate activators and the reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate-linked thioredoxin system of Escherichia coli which acted as the reductant. Of the ribonucleotide substrates tested, guanosine triphosphate is reduced most rapidly and its reduction is not stimulated significantly by the addition of deoxyribonucleotides. The reduction rate of adenosine triphosphate is elevated to that of GTP by the addition of dGTP; similarly, the rate of cytosine triphosphate reduction is increased to this rate by dATP. Smaller increases were observed in the rates of reduction of uridine triphosphate (with dCTP) and of inosine triphosphate (with deoxythymidine triphosphate). This activation by deoxyribonucleotides may be related to a decrease which they cause in the apparent Michaelis constant for deoxyadenosylcobalamin coenzyme. In the absence of added deoxyribonucleotides the apparent Michaelis constant for deoxyadenosylcobalamin is dependent upon the nature and concentration of the ribonucleotide substrate used in the reaction mixture. Nonlinear plots of reciprocal velocity against reciprocal ribonucleotide concentration and against reciprocal deoxyadenosylcobalamin concentration are obtained under certain conditions. The interdependence of coenzyme, substrate, and activator is interpreted as indicating that the enzyme has an allosteric site and that occupation of this site by a deoxyribonucleoside- or ribonucleoside-triphosphate increases the activity of the enzyme. The activation is believed to be effected at least in part via an increase in affinity of the enzyme for deoxyadenosylcobalamin. 5,6-Dimethylbenzimidazolyl-5'-deoxyadenosylcobamide (5'-deoxyadenosylcobalamin) and benzimidazolyl-5'-deoxyadenosylcobamide were equally active as coenzymes while adenosyl-5'-deoxyadenosylcobamide and the anilide of 5'-deoxyadenosylcobalamin, though active, gave apparent Km values 3 to 4 times greater than the former two coenzymes. 2',5'-Dideoxyadenosylcobalamin showed very slight activity and acted as a competitive inhibitor of 5'-deoxyadenosylcobalamin, whereas 5'-deoxycytidylcobalamin was inactive and a poor inhibitor."
https://openalex.org/W2053713538,A structural model for the inhibition of protein biosynthesis was previously formulated on the basis of a topochemical analogy between the ipecac alkaloids and the glutarimide antibiotics. The structure of tubulosine satisfies the requirements of this model. The prediction that such a compound would exhibit amebicidal activity and act by selectively inhibiting the transfer reaction in protein biosynthesis is confirmed.

https://openalex.org/W1519781253,"Abstract Two enzymes with deoxyribonuclease activity were isolated from Pneumococcus. One of these, an endonuclease active on both native and denatured deoxyribonucleic acid, produced 5'-phosphate-terminated fragments which, even after extensive degradation, were larger than mononucleotides. The other enzyme, an exonuclease preferentially active on native DNA, produced 5'-nucleotides and single-stranded DNA. The exonuclease also exhibited a phosphatase activity; it released 3'-terminal phosphate from 3'-P-terminated DNA. Exonuclease action generally leveled off when only 70 to 80% of the native DNA substrate had reacted. This presumably was due to pre-existing single-strand breaks in the substrate which resulted in the formation of double-stranded fragments isolated from further exonuclease action by dangling, single-stranded 3'-hydroxyl termini. Residual transforming activity in extensively degraded DNA may have corresponded to such persistent double-stranded fragments. The more nicks or ends that were introduced into the substrate, the greater was the initial rate of exonuclease action. Evidence from substrate saturation and competitive inhibition of the enzyme, however, indicated that the enzyme was bound all along the length of DNA molecules both native and denatured, and not only at the termini where it acted. By attacking one strand of incoming DNA and thereby pulling the other strand into the cell, the exonuclease may play a role in the entry of DNA in the genetic transformation of Pneumococcus, since, immediately after entry, donor DNA appears to be equally divided between single strands and 5'-deoxynucleotides. Subsequent dephosphorylation of the nucleotides may be attributed to 5'-deoxynucleotidase activities, which were shown in this investigation to be present in pneumococcal extracts."

https://openalex.org/W1591929564,"Abstract A pyridine nucleotide has been synthesized from α-nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide and adenosine triphosphate with the use of a crude enzyme preparation from Azotobacter vinelandii strain O. Evidence is presented that this nucleotide is the α isomer of NADP, α-NADP, which differs from β-NADP in the configuration of the nicotinamide-ribosidic linkage. This evidence rests on a study of (a) spectral properties, (b) degradation by snake venom phosphodiesterase followed by comparison with authentic samples, (c) stability of the nicotinamide-ribonucleosidic linkage in acid, and (d) optical rotatory dispersion. In contrast to β-NADP, α-NADP is not active with yeast glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase, nor is it cleaved by Neurospora crassa NAD glycohydrolase. α-NADP has been shown to be present in the cells of A. vinelandii; about 1:10 has been found for a normal equilibrium molar ratio of α-NADP to β-NADP."

The agent primarily responsible for inhibition was isolated and identified as phosphoadenosine diphosphate ribose. Phosphoadenosine diphosphate ribose was found to be a very specific inhibitor for NADP+ dehydrogenases. It had no effect on NAD+-specific enzymes."

https://openalex.org/W1539927167,"Abstract 5,10-Methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase has been purified nearly 200-fold from Salmonella typhimurium. The purified enzyme is highly unstable and can only be preserved as a suspension in ammonium sulfate at 50% saturation. The apparent Km values obtained for d,l-methylenetetrahydrofolate and NADP+ were 9.2 x 10-5 m and 4.5 x 10-5 m, respectively. The enzyme is inhibited by purine nucleotides. ATP acts as a noncompetitive inhibitor with respect to d,l-methylenetetrahydrofolate, but there is some competition between ATP and NADP+. Inhibition is incomplete even at high ATP concentrations, nearly 20% of activity being retained at ATP levels more than 10 times the apparent Ki concentration. The partial desensitization of the enzyme to inhibition was obtained by variations in pH and by p-hydroxymercuribenzoate. The inhibition by purine nucleotides could serve as a physiologically important control mechanism preventing the unnecessary accumulation of the 5,10-methenyl and 10-formyl derivatives of tetrahydrofolate, both of which are involved in the transformylation reactions of purine biosynthesis, and the retention of activity at high inhibitor concentrations may be essential in order to maintain enough formyl-tetrahydrofolate for transformylations other than those involved in purine synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1544433139,"Abstract The capsular polysaccharide (SI) of Type I Pneumococcus has been purified by chromatography on DEAE-Sephadex and by recovery from its specific precipitate with homologous antibody. Disadvantages of direct acid hydrolyses of SI have been overcome by reduction of many of the hexuronic acid residues to hexose, and by N-acetylation of SI. These and other described modifications decrease the amounts of antibody precipitated from antipneumococcal Type I sera. d-Glucose, hitherto tentatively suggested as a component, is present. Deamination of SI by nitrous acid yields at least six products, two of which indicate that SI contains residues of the disaccharides, galacturonosyl-galactosamine and galacturonosyl-glucosamine. Residues of 2-amino-2-deoxy-hexosyl-glucose are also indicated. An oligosaccharide from partially carboxyl-reduced SI is tentatively assigned the partial structure, galacturonosyl-(1 → 3)-glucosaminyl-(1 → 3)-galacturonic acid."

At pH 7.0, the dissociation constant of dihydrofolate from the enzyme-dihydrofolate complex was 1.2 x 10-7 m, 10 times greater than that of NADPH and several times less than that of folate at the same pH. Dihydrofolate, folate, or NADPH binding to the enzyme in binary complex did not vary significantly with pH, except for a 5-fold decrease in the binding of folate at pH 9.0. Triamterene (2,4,7-triamino-6-phenylpteridine) binding to the enzyme in binary complex showed a marked decrease above pH 7.0 and was not detectable at pH 9.0. The binding of NADPH in ternary complex of enzyme, triamterene, and NADPH was 10 times greater than that in binary complex of enzyme and NADPH, and did not vary significantly with pH except for a 4-fold decrease at pH 9.0, probably related to the decreased binding of triamterene at this pH. Pyrimidine inhibitors which possess a hydrophobic side chain were bound more tightly in ternary than in binary complex, whereas those with a p-aminobenzoylglutamic acid side chain were not. It is suggested that hydrophobic bonding may be enhanced in ternary complex because of a possible conformational change in enzyme when combined with NADPH."
