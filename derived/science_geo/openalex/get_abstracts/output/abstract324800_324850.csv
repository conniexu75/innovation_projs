https://openalex.org/W2040620679,"The article reviews the available information on the start of fruit tree cultivation in the Old World. On the basis of (i) evaluation of the available archeological remains and (ii) examination of the wild relatives of the cultivated crops, it was concluded that olive, grape, date, and fig were the first important horticultural additions to the Mediterranean grain agriculture. They were most likely domesticated in the Near East in protohistoric time (fourth and third millennia B.C.) and they emerge as important food elements in the early Bronze Age. Domestication of all four fruit trees was based on a shift from sexual reproduction (in the wild) to vegetative propagation of clones (under domestication). Olive, grape, date, and fig can be vegetatively propagated by simple techniques (cuttings, basal knobs, suckers) and were thus preadapted for domestication early in the development of agriculture. The shift to clonal propagation placed serious limitations on selection and on fruit set under cultivation. We have examined the consequences of this shift in terms of the genetic makeup of the cultivars and traced the various countermeasures that evolved to ensure fruit set. Finally, it was pointed out that in each of these classic fruit trees we are confronted with a variable complex of genuinely wild types, secondary weedy derivatives and feral plants, and groups of the domesticated clones, which are all interfertile and interconnected by occasional hybridization. It was concluded that introgression from the diversified wild gene pool facilitated the rapid buildup of variation in the domesticated crops."

Fraction 1 protein isolated from the leaves of parasexual hybrid plants derived from the fusion of protoplasts of Nicotiana glauca and N. langsdorffii contains the small subunit polypeptides of both parent species and the large subunit polypeptides of only N. glauca. Fraction 1 protein isolated from the leaves of a hybrid plant obtained after the uptake of chloroplasts of N. suaveolens by protoplasts of white tissue of a variegating mutant of N. tabacum contains the large subunit polypeptides of both N. suaveolens and N. tabacum, as well as the small subunit polypeptides of both these species."

The effect was a large and rapid decrease in the total number of ionospheric electrons within a distance of 1000 kilometers of the burning engines of the Saturn V launch vehicle. The observations are interpreted in terms of exceptionally enhanced chemical loss rates due to the molecular hydrogen and water vapor contained in the Saturn second-stage exhaust plume."

At present, the minimum total mercury concentration detectable with this device is 0.2 microgram per cubic meter of air-one fifth of the proposed federal guideline. This is the first technique which responds to both mercury vapor and mercury in particulates available for continuous monitoring at this concentration."

https://openalex.org/W2009549313,"This article represents only a brief glimpse into one of the fascinating aspects of the chemistry of electronically excited molecules. More exhaustive coverage of synthetic applications of photochemical reactions may be found in texts and reviews. We summarize here by noting that classification of reliable photoreactions is possible, but that the most effective application of the classification scheme requires a familiarity with some of the special features of the chemistry of electronically excited states. Thus, knowledge of the properties of singlet and triplet states, the factors which determine photochemical efficiency and reactivity, and the special technical aspects of photochemical procedures such as selective direct and phtosensitized excitation and photoexcitation at low temperatures or solid matrices make photochemistry a useful tool for the construction of organic molecules. It is our hope that the material and flavor of this article will whet the intellectual and experimental appetites of researchers who are concerned with various aspects of the synthesis of oganic molecules."

https://openalex.org/W1999372391,"The engineering profession of the world can be expected to give more attention to the animal-plant food cycles in the years ahead and to determine new methods of preserving for complete utilization the critical and exhaustible supplies of plant foods for the generations yet to live. Coincidentally with this obligation which the engineer must assume, there is the romantic but very real task ahead of applying the same intensive interest in the ultimate preservation of foods as the agriculturists have displayed in producing them."
