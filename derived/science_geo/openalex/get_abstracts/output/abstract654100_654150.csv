https://openalex.org/W3032915827,"Effective therapies to treat coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are urgently needed. While many investigational, approved, and repurposed drugs have been suggested as potential treatments, preclinical data from animal models can guide the search for effective treatments by ruling out those that lack efficacy in vivo. Remdesivir (GS-5734) is a nucleotide analogue prodrug with broad antiviral activity1,2 that is currently being investigated in COVID-19 clinical trials and recently received Emergency Use Authorization from the US Food and Drug Administration3,4. In animal models, remdesivir was effective against infection with Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV)2,5,6. In vitro, remdesivir inhibited replication of SARS-CoV-27,8. Here we investigate the efficacy of remdesivir in a rhesus macaque model of SARS-CoV-2 infection9. Unlike vehicle-treated animals, macaques treated with remdesivir did not show signs of respiratory disease; they also showed reduced pulmonary infiltrates on radiographs and reduced virus titres in bronchoalveolar lavages twelve hours after the first dose. Virus shedding from the upper respiratory tract was not reduced by remdesivir treatment. At necropsy, remdesivir-treated animals had lower lung viral loads and reduced lung damage. Thus, treatment with remdesivir initiated early during infection had a clinical benefit in rhesus macaques infected with SARS-CoV-2. Although the rhesus macaque model does not represent the severe disease observed in some patients with COVID-19, our data support the early initiation of remdesivir treatment in patients with COVID-19 to prevent progression to pneumonia. The nucleotide analogue prodrug remdesivir reduces viral load and lung disease in a rhesus macaque model of SARS-CoV-2 infection."
https://openalex.org/W3021060601,"Large-scale sequencing of RNA from individual cells can reveal patterns of gene, isoform and allelic expression across cell types and states1. However, current short-read single-cell RNA-sequencing methods have limited ability to count RNAs at allele and isoform resolution, and long-read sequencing techniques lack the depth required for large-scale applications across cells2,3. Here we introduce Smart-seq3, which combines full-length transcriptome coverage with a 5' unique molecular identifier RNA counting strategy that enables in silico reconstruction of thousands of RNA molecules per cell. Of the counted and reconstructed molecules, 60% could be directly assigned to allelic origin and 30-50% to specific isoforms, and we identified substantial differences in isoform usage in different mouse strains and human cell types. Smart-seq3 greatly increased sensitivity compared to Smart-seq2, typically detecting thousands more transcripts per cell. We expect that Smart-seq3 will enable large-scale characterization of cell types and states across tissues and organisms."
https://openalex.org/W2946232537,"Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) is the leading technique for characterizing the transcriptomes of individual cells in a sample. The latest protocols are scalable to thousands of cells and are being used to compile cell atlases of tissues, organs and organisms. However, the protocols differ substantially with respect to their RNA capture efficiency, bias, scale and costs, and their relative advantages for different applications are unclear. In the present study, we generated benchmark datasets to systematically evaluate protocols in terms of their power to comprehensively describe cell types and states. We performed a multicenter study comparing 13 commonly used scRNA-seq and single-nucleus RNA-seq protocols applied to a heterogeneous reference sample resource. Comparative analysis revealed marked differences in protocol performance. The protocols differed in library complexity and their ability to detect cell-type markers, impacting their predictive value and suitability for integration into reference cell atlases. These results provide guidance both for individual researchers and for consortium projects such as the Human Cell Atlas. A multicenter study compares 13 commonly used single-cell RNA-seq protocols."
https://openalex.org/W3011119456,"Type VI CRISPR enzymes are RNA-targeting proteins with nuclease activity that enable specific and robust target gene knockdown without altering the genome. To define rules for the design of Cas13d guide RNAs (gRNAs), we conducted massively parallel screens targeting messenger RNAs (mRNAs) of a green fluorescent protein transgene, and CD46, CD55 and CD71 cell-surface proteins in human cells. In total, we measured the activity of 24,460 gRNAs with and without mismatches relative to the target sequences. Knockdown efficacy is driven by gRNA-specific features and target site context. Single mismatches generally reduce knockdown to a modest degree, but spacer nucleotides 15-21 are largely intolerant of target site mismatches. We developed a computational model to identify optimal gRNAs and confirm their generalizability, testing 3,979 guides targeting mRNAs of 48 endogenous genes. We show that Cas13 can be used in forward transcriptomic pooled screens and, using our model, predict optimized Cas13 gRNAs for all protein-coding transcripts in the human genome."

However, the underlying pathogenic mechanism is largely unclear. Here, we report that the suppression of Nei-like DNA glycosylase 2 (NEIL2), a mammalian DNA glycosylase that specifically removes oxidized bases, is one mechanism through which H. pylori infection may fuel the accumulation of DNA damage leading to GC. Using cultured cell lines, gastric biopsy specimens, primary cells, and human enteroid-derived monolayers from healthy human stomach, we show that H. pylori infection greatly reduces NEIL2 expression. The H. pylori infection-induced downregulation of NEIL2 was specific, as Campylobacter jejuni had no such effect. Using gastric organoids isolated from the murine stomach in coculture experiments with live bacteria mimicking the infected stomach lining, we found that H. pylori infection is associated with the production of various inflammatory cytokines. This response was more pronounced in Neil2 knockout (KO) mouse cells than in WT cells, suggesting that NEIL2 suppresses inflammation under physiological conditions. Notably, the H. pylori-infected Neil2-KO murine stomach exhibited more DNA damage than the WT. Furthermore, H. pylori-infected Neil2-KO mice had greater inflammation and more epithelial cell damage. Computational analysis of gene expression profiles of DNA glycosylases in gastric specimens linked the reduced Neil2 level to GC progression. Our results suggest that NEIL2 downregulation is a plausible mechanism by which H. pylori infection impairs DNA damage repair, amplifies the inflammatory response, and initiates GC.

H. pylori is a Gram-negative, microaerophilic bacterium that infects the gastric mucosa, causing gastritis and often leading to devastating complications, such as peptic ulcers and GC. H. pylori infection increases the risk of developing GCs by 5–6-fold (6Koeppel M. Garcia-Alcalde F. Glowinski F. Schlaermann P. Meyer T.F.

Treatment and eventual eradication of the infection could reduce the risk of developing such complications but cannot completely erase the possible threat. Additionally, an increasing number of studies report antibiotic resistance among H. pylori strains (7Abadi A.T.B.

As for the pathogenesis of GCs, infection with H. pylori of both gastric cell lines and primary gastric epithelial cells has been shown to trigger a unique DNA damage pattern that preferentially targets transcribed regions and regions proximal to telomeres (6Koeppel M.

However, how H. pylori infection results in the accumulation of DNA damage remains unknown. Generally, bacterial infection-induced inflammation leads to the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) that cause oxidative genome damage in the host cells.

BER is a multistep process that is initiated with recognition and excision of the lesion by a family of repair proteins called DNA glycosylases (DGs). All four DNA bases are subjected to oxidative modifications leading to approximately two dozen lesions; only 5 oxidized base-specific DNA glycosylases with overlapping substrate specificities have been characterized so far in mammalian cells. Among them, OGG1 and NTH1, which were identified and characterized earlier, primarily remove oxidized purines and pyrimidines, respectively, and were thought to be the major mammalian DNA glycosylases. However, null mice of these two DGs did not show any visible phenotype (16Wang L.J. Ma F. Tang B. Zhang C.Y.

NEILs are capable of removing both purines and pyrimidines, but they are unique with respect to DNA damage recognition.

Several reports indicate that H. pylori-induced ROS can cause oxidative DNA damage leading to the accumulation of mutations (33Handa O. Naito Y. Yoshikawa T. Helicobacter pylori: a ROS-inducing bacterial species in the stomach.Inflamm. Res. 2010; 59 (20820854): 997-100310.1007/s00011-010-0245-xCrossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 34Davies G.R.

Hence, it is expected that aberrant expression and/or compromised activities of the DGs will be contributing factors for various pathologies, including carcinogenesis. Surprisingly, despite the accumulation of significantly larger amounts of mutagenic 8-oxoG in Ogg1−/− mice, these animals did not develop tumors when exposed to KBrO3, an oxygen radical-forming agent (35Touati E. Michel V. Thiberge J.M. Ave P. Huerre M. Bourgade F. Klungland A. Labigne A. Deficiency in OGG1 protects against inflammation and mutagenic effects associated with H. pylori infection in mouse.Helicobacter. 2006; 11 (16961812): 494-50510.1111/j.1523-5378.2006.00442.xCrossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Moreover, Ogg1-null mice are resistant to H. pylori-induced inflammation. These data suggest that oxidized DNA base lesions alone are not sufficient for developing GCs; some other factor(s) is necessary for developing tumors in the affected tissues. Based on the link between NEIL2 and various types of cancers, we hypothesized that H. pylori infection triggers the accumulation of mutations via dysregulation of NEIL2. Using the stem cell-based ex vivo technique in which gastric organoids were isolated from the stomach of WT and Neil2 knockout (KO) mice and an in vivo infection model, we report here that the level of NEIL2, but not that of other DGs, is significantly decreased upon H. pylori infection, leading to increased DNA damage accumulation and inflammatory responses. Because ROS, DNA damage, and inflammation are closely intertwined, and because NEIL2 is an anti-inflammatory protein in addition to its role in DNA repair (26Chakraborty A. Wakamiya M. Venkova-Canova T. Pandita R.K. Aguilera-Aguirre L. Sarker A.H. Singh D.K. Hosoki K. Wood T.G. Sharma G. Cardenas V. Sarkar P.S. Sur S. Pandita T.K. Boldogh I. et al.Neil2-null mice accumulate oxidized DNA bases in the transcriptionally active sequences of the genome and are susceptible to innate inflammation.J. Biol.

To determine the expression of BER proteins in gastric epithelial cells after H. pylori infection, AGS cells were transfected with the C-terminal FLAG-tagged expression plasmids of OGG1, NEIL1, NEIL2 and NTH1, followed by infection with H. pylori. Surprisingly, the level of NEIL2-FLAG (with a 5-fold higher expression than endogenous NEIL2 [Fig. S1]), but not that of the other DNA glycosylases, was significantly decreased in the AGS cell lysate at the protein level (Fig. 1A). To determine whether the stably expressed NEIL2-FLAG is downregulated in transcript level after infection, we specifically detected the NEIL2-FLAG transcript level (Fig. S2A and B). We indeed found its downregulation at 24 h and 48 h postinfection. The empty vector-expressing control cells did not show any amplification of the NEIL2-FLAG transcript, indicating specific amplification in NEIL2-FLAG-expressing cells (Fig. S3A). However, the NEIL2 transcript level was decreased significantly following H. pylori infection in control cells (Fig. S3A and B), indicating the downregulation of the endogenous NEIL2 as well. To further confirm this, AGS cells were infected with H. pylori, and it was found that the endogenous expression of NEIL2, but not OGG1, was significantly decreased (Fig. 1B). Furthermore, the expression of NEIL2 following H. pylori infection was decreased in a time-dependent manner. NEIL2 protein and its transcript level started to decrease at 6 h postinfection and became undetectable at 24 h and 48 h (Fig. 1C). To test the effect of H. pylori inoculum on NEIL2 expression, AGS cells were infected with H. pylori at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 10 and 100, and the expression of NEIL2 was determined by Western blot analysis. The reduction of NEIL2 expression was more pronounced in AGS lysates at higher bacterial load (Fig. 1D), indicating that H. pylori infection is linked to the downregulation of NEIL2. To understand the impact of H. pylori infection on NEIL2 expression in primary and transformed gastric cells (Fig. 2A), we used the epithelial cell lines AGS, NCI-N87 from gastric carcinoma, and normal human fetal gastric/intestinal cells, Hs738 (36Beswick E.J. Das S. Pinchuk I.V. Adegboyega P. Suarez G. Yamaoka Y. Reyes V.E. Helicobacter pylori-induced IL-8 production by gastric epithelial cells up-regulates CD74 expression.J. Immunol. 2005; 175 (15972644): 171-17610.4049/jimmunol.175.1.171Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Figure 2B demonstrates the time-dependent changes in the NEIL2 transcript level at 0, 1, 3, 6, and 12 h post-H. pylori infection in AGS cells. The NEIL2 mRNA expression was increased at 1 h postinfection, followed by a significant decrease in the transcript level in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 2B). Similarly, the level of NEIL2 transcription was also downregulated in Hs738, the nontransformed gastric cells from the normal human fetus (Fig. 2C), and in NCI-N87, the transformed epithelial cell line (Fig. 2D), after 12 h of H. pylori infection. Next, we evaluated the physiological relevance of this finding in human gastric biopsy specimens (Fig. 2E, i) that were either H. pylori positive or H. pylori negative. Interestingly, H. pylori-positive specimens had lower NEIL2 expression than H. pylori-negative specimens (Fig. 2E, ii), indicating a link between H. pylori infection and the level of NEIL2 in the stomach. To understand further the effect of H. pylori infection on primary gastric epithelial cells, organoids or enteroids were isolated from healthy human gastric biopsy specimens. The enteroid-derived monolayers (EDMs) showed a significant reduction in the level of NEIL2 following H. pylori infection (Fig. 2E, iii). To investigate whether the reduced expression of NEIL2 was H. pylori infection specific, the NEIL2 expression level was measured in AGS cells infected with either H. pylori or Campylobacter jejuni, a gastrointestinal pathogen similar to H. pylori (37Moran A.P. The role of endotoxin in infection: Helicobacter pylori and Campylobacter jejuni.Subcell. Biochem. 2010; 53 (20593269): 209-24010.1007/978-90-481-9078-2_10Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). We found that NEIL2 expression was downregulated with H. pylori infection but not with C. jejuni infection (Fig. 3A). To investigate if NEIL2 expression depended on specific genes or the virulence factor of H. pylori, we selected two mutant H. pylori strains: 1) alkyl hydroperoxide reductase (AhpC) (an enzyme crucial for oxidative stress resistance and the survival of the bacterium in the host that generates higher amounts of 8-oxo-guanine associated with their DNA [38Wang G.

https://openalex.org/W3033568738,"The presupposition of genomic selection (GS) is that predictive accuracies should be based on population-wide linkage disequilibrium (LD). However, in species with large, highly complex genomes the limitation of marker density may preclude the ability to resolve LD accurately enough for GS. Here we investigate such an effect in two conifer species with ~ 20 Gbp genomes, Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii Mirb. (Franco)) and Interior spruce (Picea glauca (Moench) Voss x Picea engelmannii Parry ex Engelm.). Random sampling of markers was performed to obtain SNP sets with totals in the range of 200-50,000, this was replicated 10 times. Ridge Regression Best Linear Unbiased Predictor (RR-BLUP) was deployed as the GS method to test these SNP sets, and 10-fold cross-validation was performed on 1,321 Douglas-fir trees, representing 37 full-sib F1 families and on 1,126 Interior spruce trees, representing 25 open-pollinated (half-sib) families. Both trials are located on 3 sites in British Columbia, Canada.As marker number increased, so did GS predictive accuracy for both conifer species. However, a plateau in the gain of accuracy became apparent around 10,000-15,000 markers for both Douglas-fir and Interior spruce. Despite random marker selection, little variation in predictive accuracy was observed across replications. On average, Douglas-fir prediction accuracies were higher than those of Interior spruce, reflecting the difference between full- and half-sib families for Douglas-fir and Interior spruce populations, respectively, as well as their respective effective population size.Although possibly advantageous within an advanced breeding population, reducing marker density cannot be recommended for carrying out GS in conifers. Significant LD between markers and putative causal variants was not detected using 50,000 SNPS, and GS was enabled only through the tracking of relatedness in the populations studied. Dramatically increasing marker density would enable said markers to better track LD with causal variants in these large, genetically diverse genomes; as well as providing a model that could be used across populations, breeding programs, and traits."
https://openalex.org/W3034066567,"Representational distinctions within categories are important in all perceptual modalities and also in cognitive and motor representations. Recent pattern-information studies of brain activity have used condition-rich designs to sample the stimulus space more densely. To test whether brain response patterns discriminate among a set of stimuli (e.g. exemplars within a category) with good sensitivity, we can pool statistical evidence over all pairwise comparisons. Here we describe a wide range of statistical tests of exemplar discriminability and assess the validity (specificity) and power (sensitivity) of each test. The tests include previously used and novel, parametric and nonparametric tests, which treat subject as a random or fixed effect, and are based on different dissimilarity measures, different test statistics, and different inference procedures. We use simulated and real data to determine which tests are valid and which are most sensitive. A popular test statistic reflecting exemplar information is the exemplar discriminability index (EDI), which is defined as the average of the pattern dissimilarity estimates between different exemplars minus the average of the pattern dissimilarity estimates between repetitions of identical exemplars. The popular across-subject t test of the EDI (typically using correlation distance as the pattern dissimilarity measure) requires the assumption that the EDI is 0-mean normal under H0. Although this assumption is not strictly true, our simulations suggest that the test controls the false-positives rate at the nominal level, and is thus valid, in practice. However, test statistics based on average Mahalanobis distances or average linear-discriminant t values (both accounting for the multivariate error covariance among responses) are substantially more powerful for both random- and fixed-effects inference. Unlike average cross-validated distances, the EDI is sensitive to differences between the distributions associated with different exemplars (e.g. greater variability for some exemplars than for others), which complicates its interpretation. We suggest preferred procedures for safely and sensitively detecting subtle pattern differences between exemplars."

Two nuclear-encoded vertebrate mitochondrial high-affinity iron importers, mitoferrin1 (Mfrn1) and Mfrn2, have been identified in mammals. In mice, the gene encoding Mfrn1, solute carrier family 25 member 37 (Slc25a37), is highly expressed in sites of erythropoiesis, and whole-body Slc25a37 deletion leads to lethality. Here, we report that mice with a deletion of Slc25a28 (encoding Mfrn2) are born at expected Mendelian ratios, but show decreased male fertility due to reduced sperm numbers and sperm motility. Mfrn2−/− mice placed on a low-iron diet exhibited reduced mitochondrial manganese, cobalt, and zinc levels, but not reduced iron. Hepatocyte-specific loss of Slc25a37 (encoding Mfrn1) in Mfrn2−/− mice did not affect animal viability, but resulted in a 40% reduction in mitochondrial iron and reduced levels of oxidative phosphorylation proteins. Placing animals on a low-iron diet exaggerated the reduction in mitochondrial iron observed in liver-specific Mfrn1/2-knockout animals. Mfrn1−/−/Mfrn2−/− bone marrow–derived macrophages or skin fibroblasts in vitro were unable to proliferate, and overexpression of Mfrn1-GFP or Mfrn2-GFP prevented this proliferation defect. Loss of both mitoferrins in hepatocytes dramatically reduced regeneration in the adult mouse liver, further supporting the notion that both mitoferrins transport iron and that their absence limits proliferative capacity of mammalian cells.

Organisms with only one Mfrn such as C. elegans, D. melanogaster, and plants show lethality when deleted (9Bashir K. Ishimaru Y. Shimo H. Nagasaka S. Fujimoto M. Takanashi H. Tsutsumi N. An G. Nakanishi H. Nishizawa N.K. The rice mitochondrial iron transporter is essential for plant growth.Nat.

Mutations in the D. melanogaster homologue dmfrn result in male sterility, which can be rescued by providing high iron in the diet (12Metzendorf C. Lind M.I. The role of iron in the proliferation of Drosophila l(2) mbn cells.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2010; 400 (20807501): 442-44610.1016/j.bbrc.2010.08.100Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), suggesting other transporters can transport iron into the mitochondria under high iron conditions. It has been speculated that mammalian Mfrn2 is the mitochondrial iron importer for all other tissues, however, one study suggests that Mfrn1 and Mfrn2 are both needed in adipogenic differentiation (16Chen Y.C. Wu Y.T. Wei Y.H. Depletion of mitoferrins leads to mitochondrial dysfunction and impairment of adipogenic differentiation in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes.Free Radic. Res. 2015; 49 (26118715): 1285-129510.3109/10715762.2015.1067695Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Here, we show that Mfrn2 is not essential for viability but is important in reproduction and contributes to effective cell proliferation. Mfrn2−/− male mice show decreased sperm counts in seminal fluid and decreased sperm motility. Mfrn2−/− mice do not show reductions in mitochondrial iron levels in liver but show reduced mitochondrial manganese, cobalt, and zinc levels when animals are placed on a low-iron diet. Loss of both Mfrn1 and Mfrn2 in primary macrophages and skin fibroblasts resulted in a proliferation defect with corresponding reductions in mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation proteins. Indeed, feeding animals a low-iron diet revealed dramatic reductions in mitochondrial iron and that loss of Mfrn1 and Mfrn2 is additive in reducing mitochondrial iron. We further show that deletion of Mfrn1 in the liver of Mfrn2−/− mice significantly impairs liver regeneration. The murine Mfrn2 (Slc25a28) gene consists of 4 exons spread over 11 kb on the reverse strand of mouse chromosome 19. We originally designed a strategy to conditionally disrupt the Mfrn2 gene by knocking out exon 1, however, we never obtained mouse embryonic stem cell G418-resistant clones that showed the correct homologous recombination. We attributed this result to poor recombination due to the high level of repeats in the 5'-upstream region of exon 1. Mfrn2 has six predicted transmembrane domains. We hypothesized that loss of the final two transmembrane domains would disrupt function. To test this hypothesis, we generated a yeast-expressed truncated zMfrn2 construct where the last two transmembrane domains were deleted. Although full-length zMfrn2 complemented the loss of Mrs3 and Mrs4 (Δmrs3Δmrs4), a truncated zMfrn2 (truncZMfrn2) did not complement the loss (Fig. 1A). To determine whether loss of the last two transmembrane domains affected protein expression or mitochondrial localization we generate mammalian constructs of full-length and truncated mouse Mfrn2 with a carboxyl GFP tag expressed under the cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter. We transfected those constructs along with mouse Mfrn1-mCherry into mouse fibroblasts and examined expression by microscopy. Full-length Mfrn2-GFP localized with Mfrn1-mCherry, whereas, truncating the last two transmembrane domains of mouse Mfrn2 (truncMfrn2-GFP) resulted in the loss of mitochondrial localization (Fig. 1B). Based upon these results, we generated a “knock-out” construct that targeted deletion of exon4 in mouse Mfrn2, which would eliminate the last two transmembrane domains. Two Loxp sites and a neomycin-resistance gene flanked with FRT sites (FNF) were cloned on either side of exon 4 to permit excision of exon 4 (Fig. S1A). This construct was introduced by electroporation into mouse G4 embryonic stem (ES) cells (C57BL6/129 hybrid). ES cell clones resistant to G418 were analyzed for correct homologous recombination by Southern blotting and PCR analyses. Southern blotting analysis showed several ES clones positive for the insert (Fig. S1B). PCR analyses confirmed the presence of the Loxp-FRT-neomycin-FRT cassette flanking exon 4, and the second Loxp site in the recombinant Mfrn2 locus. Cells from a single heterozygous clone (#8) were injected into C57BL/6J-derived blastocysts that were implanted into foster mothers. Chimeric animals were identified by coat color, and males were mated with C57BL/6J females to produce mice heterozygous at the Mfrn2 locus (Mfrn2floxneo/+). The neomycin-resistance cassette was subsequently excised by recombination of FRT sites by breeding Mfrn2floxneo/+ mice with flp/flp mice that express Flp recombinase under the Rosa26 promoter generating heterozygous Mfrn2flox/+ animals. Mfrn2flox/+ animals were mated with CMV-Cre recombinase mice to generate Mfrn2+/− animals. Mfrn2+/− animals were mated to generate Mfrn2−/− animals. PCR genotyping demonstrated the generation of Mfrn2+/+, Mfrn2+/−, and Mfrn2−/− animals (Fig. 1C) and RT-PCR confirmed the loss of Mfrn2 mRNA (Fig. 1D). Mfrn2−/− animals were born in the expected Mendelian ratios. Tissue-specific RT-qPCR demonstrated a 50% reduction in Mfrn2 mRNA in heterozygotes and complete loss of Mfrn2 mRNA in all tissues of Mfrn2−/− animals (Fig. 2A). Unfortunately, we were unable to determine Mfrn2 protein levels as available antibodies did not work in mouse tissues. There was a slight increase in liver nonheme iron levels in the absence of Mfrn2 (Fig. 2B) but no differences in mitochondrial nonheme iron levels as measured by the bathophenanthroline chromogen assay (Fig. 2C). Animals placed on a low-iron diet, however, showed changes in mitochondrial metals as assessed by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). Loss of Mfrn2 resulted in a slight but significant increase in total mitochondrial iron (Fe) levels and significantly decreased manganese (Mn), cobalt (Co), and zinc (Zn) with no difference in copper (Cu) levels, which was seen in both Mfrn2+/− and Mfrn2−/− liver mitochondria (Fig. 2D) suggesting haploinsufficiency.Figure 2Tissue-specific RT-qPCR in Mfrn2+/+, Mfrn2+/−, and Mfrn2−/− mice confirmed loss of Mfrn2 mRNA in all tissues and no changes in mitochondrial iron.

Western blotting analysis, however, did not show an increase in kidney Mfrn1 protein levels (Fig. S2). Mfrn2−/− animals did not show any overt phenotypes in hematologic parameters (Fig. S3A). Breeder pairs of Mfrn2−/− mice revealed that the Mfrn2−/− males showed a decreased ability to reproduce, which worsened over time (Fig. 3A). The decreased fertility phenotype in mice was not fully penetrant as some Mfrn2−/− male mice were able to reproduce normally. The decreased male fertility could be attributed to reduced numbers of sperm (Fig. 3B) and significantly reduced sperm motility (Fig. 3C). These results confirm reports that mutations in the D. melanogaster dmfrn gene result in loss of male reproduction with unorganized, small or immature sperm (12Metzendorf C. Lind M.I. The role of iron in the proliferation of Drosophila l(2) mbn cells.Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Previously, we demonstrated that liver-specific loss of Mfrn1 resulted in increased PPIX accumulation in the livers of animals fed aminolevulenic acid (ALA), a condition that bypasses the rate-limiting step in heme biosynthesis resulting in increased heme synthesis (8Troadec M.B. Warner D. Wallace J. Thomas K. Spangrude G.J. Phillips J. Khalimonchuk O. Paw B.H. Ward D.M. Kaplan J. Targeted deletion of the mouse Mitoferrin1 gene: from anemia to protoporphyria.Blood. 2011; 117 (21310927): 5494-550210.1182/blood-2010-11-319483Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). We performed similar experiments in total body Mfrn2−/− mice. While feeding ALA did increase porphyrin levels in liver of all animals (note the scale), there were no statistically significant genotypic differences in PPIX levels (Fig. S3B). These results support that there are no differences in mitochondrial iron in the liver of Mfrn2−/− mice (if iron was decreased PPIX would accumulate) and the iron present is available and sufficient to populate PPIX when heme synthesis is increased. We did not see a significant increase in PPIX in contrast to our previous report in hepatocyte-specific Mfrn1−/− mice (8Troadec M.B. Warner D. Wallace J. Thomas K. Spangrude G.J. Phillips J. Khalimonchuk O. Paw B.H. Ward D.M. Kaplan J. Targeted deletion of the mouse Mitoferrin1 gene: from anemia to protoporphyria.Blood. 2011; 117 (21310927): 5494-550210.1182/blood-2010-11-319483Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). We also did not observe the histologic changes reported previously in the hepatocyte-specific Mfrn1−/− mice. The differences with previously reported data may be due to different experimental factors such as age of the mice (6 versus 12 weeks) when the ALA feeding was started or a difference in the mouse environment. No changes in liver mitochondrial oxygen consumption were observed in the absence of Mfrn2 (Fig. S4A) supporting that mitochondrial function was not compromised. Studies have demonstrated that Mfrn1 was necessary for red cell formation, however, Mfrn1 loss was not reported to affect heart, liver, or muscle development (8Troadec M.B. Warner D. Wallace J. Thomas K. Spangrude G.J. Phillips J. Khalimonchuk O. Paw B.H. Ward D.M. Kaplan J. Targeted deletion of the mouse Mitoferrin1 gene: from anemia to protoporphyria.Blood. 2011; 117 (21310927): 5494-550210.1182/blood-2010-11-319483Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). RNA-Seq of WT mouse livers revealed that transcript levels for Mfrn1 and Mfrn2 were similar (FPKM Mfrn1 ∼705 and Mfrn2 ∼690). To determine whether the absence of both Mfrn1 and Mfrn2 affected liver development we generated animals with a tissue-specific deletion (hepatocyte-Alb-Cre) of Mfrn1 on a Mfrn2−/− background. Surprisingly, Alb-Cre Mfrn1f/fMfrn2−/− animals were born in expected Mendelian ratios. RT-qPCR analysis of livers from 3-month–old mice demonstrated an 80% reduction in Mfrn1 transcripts in whole liver in Alb-Cre Mfrn1f/fMfrn2−/− mice and an even greater reduction in Mfrn1 in a crude isolation of hepatocytes confirming the ability to delete Mfrn1 in the Mfrn2−/− background (Fig. 4A). Corresponding to the reduction in Mfrn1 transcripts, we observed a dramatic reduction in Mfrn1 protein. We also successfully generated hepatocyte-specific deletion of Mfrn2 using floxed mice and these animals were born at Mendelian ratios as expected. We noted that loss of Mfrn1 or Mfrn2 in hepatocytes reduced most oxidative phosphorylation protein levels (OXPHOS) from 50 to >90% (Fig. 4B). Quantification revealed the most dramatic changes associated with CI-NDUFB8 protein when Mfrn1 was absent either in the single or double hepatocyte-specific knockout (Fig. 4C, column 1 versus columns 2-4). Although the decrease in protein levels was most significant when Mfrn1 was absent, CI complex activity was reduced by ∼40% in all deletion strains (Fig. 4D). CI-NDFU8B is the first protein in the electron transport chain that catalyzes the two electron oxidation of NADH by coenzyme Q10. CII levels were also dramatically decreased in the absence of Mfrns suggesting that Fe-S cluster synthesis may be compromised. These data also suggest that both Mfrn1 and Mfrn2 contribute to iron delivery to the mitochondria for sustaining Fe-S cluster formation. Another Fe-S cluster protein whose activity is highly dependent upon the presence of the Fe-S cluster is mitochondrial aconitase. Indeed, loss of Mfrn1 or Mfrn2 reduced aconitase activity (Fig. 5A). Placing animals on low iron chow for 10 weeks resulted in a decrease in aconitase activity in WT animals but no statistically significant differences in aconitase activity were observed upon Mfrn1 and/or Mfrn2 hepatocyte-specific loss (Fig. 5A, white bars). We did not observe differences in the activity of the cytosolic Fe-S cluster protein xanthine oxidase (Fig. S4B). We also did not observe differences in the heme-containing enzyme catalase in most strains of mice fed normal chow. We did observe genotypic reductions in catalase activity when animals were placed on the low-iron diet where whole body loss of Mfrn2 showed the most dramatic reductions in catalase activity (Fig. S4C). These differences were not explained by changes in catalase protein levels (Fig. S4D).Figure 5A low-iron diet exaggerates the changes in liver and mitochondrial nonheme iron levels seen in hepatocyte-specific loss of Mfrn1 and Mfrn2 mice. A, mitochondrial aconitase activity was determined from livers of 3-month–old WT (WT), Alb-Cre Mfrn1−/− (M1), Alb-Cre Mfrn2−/− (M2), and Alb-Cre Mfrn1−/− Mfrn2−/− (M1/M2) female mice fed normal (black border bars) or low-iron chow (blue border bars) for 10 weeks. n = 4-11 animals/genotype.

No statistically significant differences in liver nonheme iron levels were detected between animals fed normal chow and all animals showed reduced nonheme iron levels when placed on low iron chow (Fig. 5B, blue bars). Liver mitochondrial isolation revealed that loss of Mfrn1 (Alb-CreMfrn1f/f (M1)) in hepatocytes showed a trend toward reduced mitochondrial nonheme iron on normal chow, which was further decreased (approximately 50%) with loss of both Mfrn1 and Mfrn2 (Alb-CreMfrn1f/fMfrn2f/f (M1/M2)) even on normal chow (Fig. 5C, black bars, Albcre M1/M2).

https://openalex.org/W3033109662,"mRNA levels are determined by the balance between mRNA synthesis and decay. Protein factors that mediate both processes, including the 5‘-3‘ exonuclease Xrn1, are responsible for a cross-talk between the two processes that buffers steady-state mRNA levels. However, the roles of these proteins in transcription remain elusive and controversial. Applying native elongating transcript sequencing (NET-seq) to yeast cells, we show that Xrn1 functions mainly as a transcriptional activator and that its disruption manifests as a reduction of RNA polymerase II (Pol II) occupancy downstream of transcription start sites. By combining our sequencing data and mathematical modeling of transcription, we found that Xrn1 modulates transcription initiation and elongation of its target genes. Furthermore, Pol II occupancy markedly increased near cleavage and polyadenylation sites in xrn1Δ cells, whereas its activity decreased, a characteristic feature of backtracked Pol II. We also provide indirect evidence that Xrn1 is involved in transcription termination downstream of polyadenylation sites. We noted that two additional decay factors, Dhh1 and Lsm1, seem to function similarly to Xrn1 in transcription, perhaps as a complex, and that the decay factors Ccr4 and Rpb4 also perturb transcription in other ways. Interestingly, the decay factors could differentiate between SAGA- and TFIID-dominated promoters. These two classes of genes responded differently to XRN1 deletion in mRNA synthesis and were differentially regulated by mRNA decay pathways, raising the possibility that one distinction between these two gene classes lies in the mechanisms that balance mRNA synthesis with mRNA decay. mRNA levels are determined by the balance between mRNA synthesis and decay.

Steady-state mRNA levels are determined by the balance between synthesis and decay rates. Once thought to function separately, recent studies have discovered that these two processes are linked. In previous work we showed that the major cytoplasmic yeast mRNA degradation pathway, consisting of the decapping enzyme Dcp1/2, the decapping activator Pat1/Lsm1-7, the helicase Dhh1, and the 5‘-3‘ exonuclease Xrn1, shuttles between the cytoplasm and the nucleus to participate in both processes. Notably, the elements of this pathway were found to degrade most mRNAs in the cytoplasm while stimulating transcription in the nucleus. The proteins Dcp2, Lsm1, and Xrn1 were further shown to bind chromatin, probably as a complex, and to stimulate transcription initiation and elongation (1Haimovich G. Medina D.A. Causse S.Z.

In fact, the former articles proposed that the deletion of Xrn1 leads to transcription activation, whereas the latter group asserted the opposite. The realization of the critical role of mRNA buffering requires changes in the approaches used to analyze transcription. In the past, mRNA levels were regarded as a good proxy for transcription, and prior studies have relied upon changes in these levels to infer alterations in transcription. As an example, earlier work classified genes as SAGA- or TFIID-dominated based on measured changes in mRNA levels after inactivation of central components of the SAGA (mainly Spt3) or TFIID (mainly Taf1) complexes (15Basehoar A.D.

However, it was recently reported that virtually all promoters recruit both the SAGA and TFIID complexes and subsequent transcriptional profiling experiments demonstrated that mutations in either complex result in widespread defective transcription (17Baptista T.

It is now clear that mRNA levels are not simply determined by two unrelated processes of mRNA synthesis and decay; rather, each of these processes affects the other by a hitherto elusive mechanism. Following transcription initiation, many metazoan genes undergo a regulatory step termed promoter-proximal pausing (reviewed recently in Refs. 20Chen F.X. Smith E.R. Shilatifard A. Born to run: control of transcription elongation by RNA polymerase II.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2018; 19 (29740129): 464-47810.1038/s41580-018-0010-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar and 21Wissink E. Vihervaara A. Tippens N. Lis J.

Specifically, after transcribing 30–120 nucleotides downstream of transcription start sites (TSS), Pol II pauses; its release into productive elongation requires the activity of specific factors, including TFIIS. Following its release, Pol II interacts with additional elongation factors that modulate its processivity. It was recently reported that the release of mammalian Pol II from a paused state in the promoter-proximal region is a key step in the regulation of transcription, both generally (22Sheridan R.M. Fong N. D'Alessandro A. Bentley D.L. Widespread backtracking by RNA Pol II is a major effector of gene activation, 5' pause release, termination, and transcription elongation rate.Mol.

Interestingly, Pol II recruitment rate was proposed to have only a marginal impact on overall transcription rates (23Bartman C.R. Hamagami N. Keller C.A. Giardine B. Hardison R.C. Blobel G.A. Raj A. Transcriptional burst initiation and polymerase pause release are key control points of transcriptional regulation.Mol.

Conversely, common wisdom posits that promoter-proximal pausing does not play a major role in budding yeast as it is less prominent than in metazoans (24Adelman K. Lis J.T. Promoter-proximal pausing of RNA polymerase II: emerging roles in metazoans.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2012; 13 (22986266): 720-73110.1038/nrg3293Crossref PubMed Scopus (763) Google Scholar). However, there is evidence that Pol II in Saccharomyces cerevisiae accumulate downstream of TSS (25Churchman L.S. Weissman J.S. Nascent transcript sequencing visualizes transcription at nucleotide resolution.Nature. 2011; 469 (21248844): 368-37310.1038/nature09652Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar), although this phenomenon and its contribution to transcriptional regulation has been little studied. In contrast with the inconclusive nature of 5' pausing, a conspicuous Pol II pausing event does occur at polyadenylation sites (PAS) (e.g. Ref. 26Mayer A. Landry H.M. Churchman L.S. Pause & Go: from the discovery of RNA polymerase pausing to its functional implications.Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2017; 46 (28363125): 72-8010.1016/j.ceb.2017.03.002Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). It is plausible that this pausing is required to provide the necessary time for the assembly of polyadenylation (PA) machinery, but gaps in the mechanistic understanding of this pausing event persist. Nevertheless, it is clear that factors of the PA pathway affect transcription termination events that occur downstream. To probe the effects of mRNA decay factors (DFs) on transcription, we employed native elongating transcript sequencing (NET-seq), an experimental protocol which assays Pol II occupancy at single nucleotide resolution. This technique sequences nascent RNA strands attached to actively engaged Pol II (27Churchman L.S. Weissman J.S. Native elongating transcript sequencing (NET-seq).Curr. Protoc. Mol. Biol. 2012; 98: 144.1-14.4.1710.1002/0471142727.mb0414s98Crossref Scopus (50) Google Scholar) and maps the 3' ends of nascent RNAs to yield the positions of Pol II active sites. Therefore, unlike RNA-seq, NET-seq data are not confounded by mRNA decay rates and give the precise locations of bound Pol II. Additionally, noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) are frequently difficult to detect using RNA-seq because of their low transcript stabilities but are easily identified using NET-seq, permitting more thorough investigations of additional classes of transcripts. In contrast to other transcription profiling methods such as Genomic Run-On (GRO) (28García-Martínez J. Aranda A. Pérez-Ortín J.E. Genomic run-on evaluates transcription rates for all yeast genes and identifies gene regulatory mechanisms.Mol. Cell. 2004; 15 (15260981): 303-31310.1016/j.molcel.2004.06.004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar) and its high-resolution cousin Biotin Genomic Run-On (BioGRO) (29Jordán-Pla A.

Chromatin-dependent regulation of RNA polymerases II and III activity throughout the transcription cycle.Nucleic Acids Res. 2015; 43 (25550430): 787-80210.1093/nar/gku1349Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 30Jordán-Pla A.

As a result, run-on methods and NET-seq are particularly informative when used in combination and can reveal information about Pol II processivity and pausing. In light of the poorly understood functions of DFs in transcription, we applied NET-seq to obtain Pol II occupancy profiles in various DF deletion strains to facilitate study of the roles of DFs in transcription. In addition to effects on initiation, Xrn1 and our other studied DFs seem to affect transcription primarily via elongation changes that are plausibly attributable to modified Pol II pausing and/or backtracking (31Gómez-Herreros F. de Miguel-Jiménez L. Millán-Zambrano G. Peñate X. Delgado-Ramos L. Muñoz-Centeno M.C. Chávez S. One step back before moving forward: regulation of transcription elongation by arrest and backtracking.FEBS Lett. 2012; 586 (22819814): 2820-282510.1016/j.febslet.2012.07.030Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). These effects primarily manifest in the ends of genes, occurring ∼100 bp downstream of TSS in the 5' end and from ∼75 bp upstream of PAS until the PAS. Similar changes in Pol II occupancy were identified in the 5', but not 3', ends of ncRNAs, implicating DFs in the regulation of the early stages of ncRNA transcription. Furthermore, deletion of XRN1 affected Pol II elongation efficiency in a manner consistent with reduced Pol II processivity. We additionally employed a recently developed mathematical model (32Erdmann-Pham D.D. Dao Duc K. Song Y.S. The key parameters that govern translation efficiency.Cell Syst. 2020; 10 (31954660): 183-19210.1016/j.cels.2019.12.003Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) to infer changes in spatial transcriptional dynamics. This methodologically novel model uses our metagene profiles to estimate baseline values for relative initiation and elongation rates, while offering a framework to systematically vary unknown parameters. This allowed us to perform in silico experiments suggesting that Xrn1 is required for efficient initiation of its target genes. In contrast to the most affected genes, NET-seq signals increase in response to Xrn1 disruption in a small repertoire of so-called “repressed” genes. Interestingly, these genes displayed demonstrably different 5' and 3' occupancy patterns upon DF deletion. Given these observed differences and comparisons with external data, we propose that the considered DFs modulate transcription of a subset of genes, perhaps as a complex, via the regulation of pausing and/or backtracking during the early and late stages of transcription. Previously we reported that Xrn1 binds to promoters and gene bodies and directly stimulates transcription initiation and elongation (1Haimovich G. Medina D.A. Causse S.Z. Garber M. Millán-Zambrano G. Barkai O. Chávez S. Pérez-Ortín J.E. Darzacq X. Choder M. Gene expression is circular: factors for mRNA degradation also foster mRNA synthesis.Cell. 2013; 153 (23706738): 1000-101110.1016/j.cell.2013.05.012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Shortly thereafter, Sun et al. (14Sun M. Schwalb B. Pirkl N. Maier K.C. Schenk A. Failmezger H. Tresch A. Cramer P. Global analysis of eukaryotic mRNA degradation reveals Xrn1-dependent buffering of transcript levels.Mol. Cell. 2013; 52 (24119399): 52-6210.1016/j.molcel.2013.09.010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) reported that the deletion of XRN1 leads to the up-regulation of transcription, implying that Xrn1 represses transcription. To resolve this discrepancy and gain insight into the mechanisms linking transcription and mRNA decay, we used NET-seq to compare Pol II occupancy in WT strains and those carrying a deletion of XRN1 (xrn1Δ). Because NET-seq does not directly capture global changes, we began by normalizing across runs by selecting sets of housekeeping genes based on prior GRO and cDTA experiments (see “Materials and methods”). As GRO and cDTA measure mRNA synthesis rates, we are assuming that genes who display the smallest changes upon DF deletion according to these assays will similarly not experience much disruption to their normal Pol II occupancy as measured by NET-seq. After normalizing, overall Pol II occupancy in xrn1Δ cells generally decreased (Fig. 1A), indicating the down-regulation of transcription. That Pol II occupancy is negatively affected by XRN1 deletion is consistent with Xrn1's proposed role as a transcriptional activator (1Haimovich G. Medina D.A. Causse S.Z. Garber M. Millán-Zambrano G. Barkai O. Chávez S. Pérez-Ortín J.E. Darzacq X. Choder M. Gene expression is circular: factors for mRNA degradation also foster mRNA synthesis.Cell. 2013; 153 (23706738): 1000-101110.1016/j.cell.2013.05.012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 2Medina D.A.

Genet. 2014; 5 (24567736): 110.3389/fgene.2014.00001Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). To provide confidence in our results, both the WT and xrn1Δ experiments were performed in replicate, producing similar NET-seq patterns (Fig. S1). We further studied additional mutant strains, each carrying a single deletion of CCR4, DHH1, or LSM1 and observed decreases in Pol II occupancy in each respective knockout, although not as strongly as in xrn1Δ cells (Fig. S2A). These results support roles for the encoded proteins as transcriptional stimulators. It is valuable to note that our findings are robust to the choice of normalization, as using other common approaches (e.g. all genes as references, total counts, and re-scaling such that genes have the same numbers of reads) produces nearly identical results (Fig. S3). We also wish to emphasize that regardless of normalization, we are able to infer relative changes in transcription dynamics from the respective NET-seq profiles, described below. In earlier work, we found that Xrn1, Lsm1, and Dcp2 produced highly similar ChIP-exo profiles (1Haimovich G. Medina D.A. Causse S.Z. Garber M. Millán-Zambrano G. Barkai O. Chávez S. Pérez-Ortín J.E.

Analogously, we sought to characterize the extent to which deletion strains induced similar genome-wide transcriptional responses using NET-seq. We constructed a correlation matrix of gene Pol II fold changes (Fig. 1B), uncovering strong similarities in transcriptomic response to deleted DFs. As an external control, we compared the correlations between our NET-seq data and previously generated NET-seq profiles from strains carrying respective deletions of EAF3, RCO1, and SET2, genes encoding a set of proteins, which are known to act in concert and are required for proper function of the Rpd3S H4 deacetylation complex (25Churchman L.S. Weissman J.S. Nascent transcript sequencing visualizes transcription at nucleotide resolution.Nature. 2011; 469 (21248844): 368-37310.1038/nature09652Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar). Strains carrying deletions in each of DST1 and SET1, encoding proteins that regulate Pol II release from backtracking and promoter directionality (25Churchman L.S. Weissman J.S.

Fold changes among these non-DF strains correlated well (ρ ∼ 0.75−0.8) as expected due to their shared functions. In contrast, correlations between these non-DFs and our studied DFs were typically much lower with the exception of SET1 (Fig. 1B). Although these experiments were done in the same laboratory using the same protocols and reagents (see “Materials and methods”), we still interpret this disparity cautiously because these data were collected by different investigators at different times. More relevant is that the correlations among our DFs were comparable with those from the other set of mutants, supporting the possibility that they act together in a complex, as has been proposed for Lsm1 and Xrn1 (1Haimovich G.

GLS1 was found to be highly expressed in fibrotic vs normal lung fibroblasts and the expression of profibrotic targets, cell migration, and soft agar colony formation stimulated by TGF-β required GLS1 activity. Moreover, knockdown of SMAD2 or SMAD3 as well as inhibition of PI3K, mTORC2, and PDGFR abrogated the induction of GLS1 by TGF-β. We further demonstrated that the NAD-dependent protein deacetylase, SIRT7, and the FOXO4 transcription factor acted as endogenous brakes for GLS1 expression, which are inhibited by TGF-β. Lastly, administration of the GLS1 inhibitor CB-839 attenuated bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis. Our study points to an exciting and unexplored connection between epigenetic and transcriptional processes that regulate glutamine metabolism and fibrotic development in a TGF-β-dependent manner."
https://openalex.org/W3032998206,"β2-Glycoprotein I (β2GPI) is an abundant plasma protein displaying phospholipid-binding properties. Because it binds phospholipids, it is a target of antiphospholipid antibodies (aPLs) in antiphospholipid syndrome (APS), a life-threatening autoimmune thrombotic disease. Indeed, aPLs prefer membrane-bound β2GPI to that in solution. β2GPI exists in two almost equally populated redox states: oxidized, in which all the disulfide bonds are formed, and reduced, in which one or more disulfide bonds are broken. Furthermore, β2GPI can adopt multiple conformations (i.e. J-elongated, S-twisted, and O-circular). While strong evidence indicates that the J-form is the structure bound to aPLs, which conformation exists and predominates in solution remains controversial, and so is the conformational pathway leading to the bound state. Here, we report that human recombinant β2GPI purified under native conditions is oxidized. Moreover, under physiological pH and salt concentrations, this oxidized form adopts a J-elongated, flexible conformation, not circular or twisted, in which the N-terminal domain I (DI) and the C-terminal domain V (DV) are exposed to the solvent. Consistent with this model, binding kinetics and mutagenesis experiments revealed that in solution the J-form interacts with negatively charged liposomes and with MBB2, a monoclonal anti-DI antibody that recapitulates most of the features of pathogenic aPLs. We conclude that the preferential binding of aPLs to phospholipid-bound β2GPI arises from the ability of its preexisting J-form to accumulate on the membranes, thereby offering an ideal environment for aPL binding. We propose that targeting the J-form of β2GPI provides a strategy to block pathogenic aPLs in APS."

The vacant parking spaces of residential area can be efficiently utilized to meet the parking demands of those who are working at nearby or come for other activities based on the parking sharing strategy. The paper analyzes the distribution of vehicle arrival numbers and parking durations, then establishes a shared parking allocation model aiming to maximize the parking benefit considering the overtime-parking behavior of the parking users. Simulation methods are used to the analyze the relationship among the parking benefit, proportion of reserved parking, numbers of parking demand, acceptance rate of parking demand and utilization of shared parking spaces. Then, based on the principle of maximum parking benefit, we can determine the optimal proportion of reserved parking, number of shared parking spaces that should be purchased from the residents. Taking the utilization of shared parking spaces as an indicator, the validity of the static allocation principle is proved to be effective. Some allocation rules for parking demand are proposed to guarantees the maximum parking revenue and minimum impact on residents simultaneously."

This study explores the relationship between adiposity and muscular strength in healthy Chilean adolescents. Adolescents (n = 491) aged 10–17 were selected from five schools in Santiago, Chile. HGS was determined by dynamometry. Anthropometry (weight, height, waist and mid arm circumference), physical activity and socioeconomic status were also measured. Relative HGS (RHGS) was calculated by dividing maximum HGS of the dominant hand by body-mass index (BMI) and low RHGS was categorized as <25th percentile by sex. Logistic regression was used to determine the relationship between two markers of adiposity (abdominal obesity category by waist circumference and nutritional status measured by BMI category) and low RHGS, adjusting for possible confounding variables. Participants were on average 13.6y (2.4), 32.8% were overweight or obese and 37.5% were at risk of or had abdominal obesity. RHGS was 1.25 kg/kg/m2 overall, with a significant difference by sex (1.51 for boys versus 1.14 for girls). In adjusted analyses, boys and girls with risk of abdominal obesity, had 3.3 (1.6–6.6) and 4.1 (1.8–9.3) increased odds of low RHGS, respectively, compared to boys and girls with normal waist circumference. Those with abdominal obesity compared to normal WC, had 8.5 (3.4–21.4) and 6.5 (2.0–21.3) increased odds of low RHGS for boys and girls, respectively. We observed similar associations for BMI category. In our sample of healthy adolescents, higher adiposity related to greater odds of low muscle strength measured by dynamometry. Considering the demographic shift from a young to an aging population in many countries, along with the increasing prevalence of obesity beginning in childhood, understanding how adiposity relates to low muscle strength is of growing importance."

This study was to investigate the protective effect of intestinal ischemic postconditioning (IPo) on IIR-induced acute kidney injury (AKI) and the underling cellular signaling mechanisms with focus on the Nrf2/HO-1. Adult C57BL/6J mice were subjected to IIR with or without IPo. IIR was established by clamping the superior mesenteric artery (SMA) for 45 minutes followed by 120 minutes reperfusion. Outcome measures were: (i) Intestinal and renal histopathology; (ii) Renal function; (iii) Cellular signaling changes; (iv) Oxidative stress and inflammatory responses. IPo significantly attenuated IIR-induced kidney injury. Furthermore, IPo significantly increased both nuclear Nrf2 and HO-1 expression in the kidney, upregulated autophagic flux, inhibited IIR-induced inflammation and reduced oxidative stress. The protective effect of IPo was abolished by the administration of Nrf2 inhibitor (Brusatol) or Nrf2 siRNA. Conversely, a Nrf2 activator t-BHQ has a similar protective effect to that of IPo. Our data indicate that IPo protects the kidney injury induced by IIR, which was likely mediated through the Nrf2/HO-1 cellular signaling activation."

We consider a third alternative: data augmentation with online crowdsourcing. Three empirical cases illustrate strengths and limitations of crowdsourcing, using Amazon Mechanical Turk to verify automated coding, link online databases, and gather data on online resources. Using these, we develop best practice guidelines and a reporting template to enhance reproducibility. Carefully designed, correctly applied, and rigorously documented crowdsourcing help address concerns about big data's usefulness for social research."
https://openalex.org/W3032951995,"The illegal import of wildlife and wildlife products is a growing concern, and the U.S. is one of the world’s leading countries in the consumption and transit of illegal wildlife and their derivatives. Yet, few U.S. studies have analyzed the illegal wildlife trade (IWT) on a national or local scale. Moreover, to our knowledge, no studies have specifically examined the trends associated with IWT moving through personal baggage. This work aimed to better understand the magnitude of illegal wildlife importation into U.S. ports of entry by determining trends associated with illegal wildlife products from personal baggage seizures, using the Pacific Northwest (PNW) as a specific case study. To identify the most influential factors determining the numbers and types of personal baggage seizures into PNW, we analyzed 1,731 records between 1999 and 2016 from the Fish and Wildlife Service’s (FWS) Law Enforcement Management Information System (LEMIS) database. We found five significant contributors: taxonomic classification of wildlife, categorical import date, wildlife product, source region, and the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) status. While wildlife seizures across taxonomic categories have generally decreased in the PNW since 2008, other findings provide a reason for concern. More specifically, mammals were identified as the largest animal group of seized wildlife, and temporal trends indicate increases in seizures for this and several other taxonomic groups. Many of the seizures originated from overseas, with East Asia serving as the largest source. Our PNW case study can be a model for how large-scale geographical seizure data can be used to inform about the major factors that have historically and presently contribute to IWT, with conservation implications globally."
https://openalex.org/W3032999690,"Cytochrome c nitrite reductase (NrfA) catalyzes the reduction of nitrite to ammonium in the dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA) pathway, a process that competes with denitrification, conserves nitrogen, and minimizes nutrient loss in soils. The environmental bacterium Geobacter lovleyi has recently been recognized as a key driver of DNRA in nature, but its enzymatic pathway is still uncharacterized. To address this limitation, here we overexpressed, purified, and characterized G. lovleyi NrfA. We observed that the enzyme crystallizes as a dimer but remains monomeric in solution. Importantly, its crystal structure at 2.55-Å resolution revealed the presence of an arginine residue in the region otherwise occupied by calcium in canonical NrfA enzymes. The presence of EDTA did not affect the activity of G. lovleyi NrfA, and site-directed mutagenesis of this arginine reduced enzymatic activity to <3% of the WT levels. Phylogenetic analysis revealed four separate emergences of Arg-containing NrfA enzymes. Thus, the Ca2+-independent, Arg-containing NrfA from G. lovleyi represents a new subclass of cytochrome c nitrite reductase. Most genera from the exclusive clades of Arg-containing NrfA proteins are also represented in clades containing Ca2+-dependent enzymes, suggesting convergent evolution."
https://openalex.org/W3033122924,"Purpose Shear-wave elastography has been recognized a useful tool for quantifying muscle stiffness, commonly reported as shear modulus, however the reports on reliability are often limited to test-retest correlations. In this study, we explored the reliability of shear-wave elastography for assessment of the trapezius muscle stiffness and its relationship with low-level muscle activity. Methods Twenty participants were included in a two-session experiment. Measurements of shear modulus and muscle activity were performed at rest and during low-level activity, induced by shoulder abduction without additional external resistance. Results Good to excellent intra-session repeatability (ICC > 0.80) and moderate inter-rater and inter-session reproducibility (ICC = 0.66–0.74) were observed. Typical errors were acceptable (7.6% of the mean value) only for intra-session measurements in resting conditions, but not acceptable for all conditions with low-level muscle activity (10.2–16.6% of the mean value). Inverse relationships between shear modulus and muscle activity at 40° and 60° of shoulder abduction (r = -0.53 and -0.57) were observed on a group level. We also found higher shear modulus in males compared to females, for the parallel probe position compared to the perpendicular position (in relation to muscle fiber orientation), and for the dominant side of the body compared to the non-dominant side. Conclusions This study showed an inverse relationship between muscle activity in low-level range and shear modulus on a group level, suggesting inherent passive stiffness could account for a larger portion of the variance (compared to muscle activity) in shear modulus when the muscle activity is low. Our results imply that shear-wave elastography can be used in research exploring muscle stiffness, however, caution is needed since only intra-session examination in resting conditions showed acceptable within-participant typical errors. The secondary analyses of the study showed higher shear modulus for males, for the non-dominant side of the body and for the parallel orientation of the ultrasound probe."
https://openalex.org/W3034001146,"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by demyelination and inflammation. Dysregulated lipid metabolism and mitochondrial dysfunction are hypothesized to play a key role in MS. Carnitine Palmitoyl Transferase 1 (CPT1) is a rate-limiting enzyme for beta-oxidation of fatty acids in mitochondria. The therapeutic effect of pharmacological CPT1 inhibition with etomoxir was investigated in rodent models of myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein- and myelin basic protein-induced experimental autoimmune encephalitis (EAE). Mice receiving etomoxir showed lower clinical score compared to placebo, however this was not significant. Rats receiving etomoxir revealed significantly lower clinical score and lower body weight compared to placebo group. When comparing etomoxir with interferon-β (IFN-β), IFN-β had no significant therapeutic effects, whereas etomoxir treatment starting at day 1 and 5 significantly improved the clinical scores compared to the IFN-β and the placebo group. Immunohistochemistry and image assessments of brain sections from rats with EAE showed higher myelination intensity and decreased expression of CPT1A in etomoxir-treated rats compared to placebo group. Moreover, etomoxir mediated increased interleukin-4 production and decreased interleukin-17α production in activated T cells. In conclusion, CPT1 is a key protein in the pathogenesis of EAE and MS and a crucial therapeutic target for the treatment."

Site 3 substitutions of murine Y185R and human Y189R in IL-12p35 completely abrogate binding to IL-12Rβ2 in a cross-species manner. Unexpectedly, we did not observe similar results for murine and human IL-23p19 substitutions. A single amino acid site 3 substitution in human IL-23p19 was insufficient to disturb signaling. However, combined substitutions of W156A and L160E disrupted binding of human IL-23p19 toward human IL-23R. IL-23p19 binds to the N-terminal Ig-like domain of IL-23R via site 3 (20Schroder J.

In case of human p19, Trp156 is stacked against Gly116, Tyr100, Leu113, and Ile28 of IL-23R within the IL-23R·p19 interface (Fig. 1). In murine p19 Trp157 and p35 Tyr185, and in human p35 Tyr189 residues are located at this position (Fig. 2A). Hence, we generated murine IL-23 and IL-12 variants and characterized the proteins regarding their effects on signal transduction. Proliferation of Ba/F3-gp130 cells stably transduced with the cDNAs coding for murine (m)IL-23R and (m)IL-12Rβ1 depended on the external stimulation with murine IL-23 (mp40–p19) or Hyper–IL-6 (HIL-6) (Fig. 2B).

To prove this hypothesis, soluble (s)mIL-12Rβ2-Fc fusion proteins were incubated with murine IL-12 (mp40–p35), precipitated by protein A–agarose beads and binding of FLAG-tagged mp40–p35 to smIL-12Rβ2-Fc was detected by Western blotting using anti-FLAG antibodies. Surprisingly, mp40–p35Y185R was not precipitated by smIL-12Rβ2-Fc via protein A–agarose, indicating that a single amino acid substitution in IL-12p35 was sufficient to abrogate cytokine–cytokine receptor interactions (Fig. 2E). Both variants were precipitated by a smIL-12Rβ1-Fc fusion protein.

In contrast, murine p40-p35Y185R failed to induce cellular proliferation and STAT3/ERK phosphorylation, indicating Tyr185 as functional site 3 hot-spot amino acid (Fig. 2, F and H). Next, we were interested in murine and human cross-species activity of IL-12, IL-23, and their variants. First, we used murine cytokines on Ba/F3 cells expressing human IL-23R and IL-12Rβ1 (Fig. S2). Murine IL-23 (mp40–p19) induced cellular proliferation and STAT3/ERK phosphorylation with the human IL-23R and IL-12Rβ1 receptors (Fig. 3, A and B), as described previously (10Parham C. Chirica M.

Surprisingly, mp40–p19W157A was still able to induce cellular proliferation and STAT3/ERK phosphorylation via the human receptors (Fig. 3, A and B). However, cellular proliferation of Ba/F3 cells with human IL-23 receptors was significantly reduced (Fig. 3A). Analogously, murine IL-12 (mp40–p35) was able to induce cellular proliferation and STAT3/ERK phosphorylation of Ba/F3 cells expressing human IL-12Rβ2 and IL-12Rβ1 (Fig. S2), but mp40–p35Y185R did not activate human receptors (Fig. 3, C and D). Consequently, we suggest that the site 3 interface of human IL-23R is differently composed than its murine counterpart. Next, we generated human Hyper–IL-23 (hp40–p19) and introduced the corresponding site 3 substitution W156A. As expected, human p40–p19 induced cell proliferation and STAT3/ERK phosphorylation of Ba/F3-gp130 cells with murine receptors. However, hp40–p19W156A was biologically inactive (Fig. 4, A–C). We could also confirm that human IL-12 is not cross-reactive with the murine receptor chains as shown previously (33Schoenhaut D.S. Chua A.O. Wolitzky A.G. Quinn P.M. Dwyer C.M. McComas W. Familletti P.C. Gately M.K. Gubler U. Cloning and expression of murine IL-12.J. Immunol. 1992; 148 (1350290): 3433-3440PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 4, D–F). Our results demonstrate that modification of site 3 in human IL-23 abrogated IL-23 signaling in cells expressing murine IL-23 receptors. Because human p40–p19W156A did not activate murine receptors, we analyzed the biological activity on human receptors. Full-length human IL-23 receptors (hIL-12Rβ1 and hIL-23R) were incubated either with FLAG-tagged human IL-23 (hp40–p19) or FLAG-tagged hp40–p19W156A and precipitated by anti–FLAG-agarose beads (Fig. 5, A and B). Binding of hIL-12Rβ1 or hIL-23R to FLAG-tagged hp40–p19 variants was detected by Western blotting using receptor specific antibodies. Precipitation of hIL-23R failed when using hp40–p19W156A indicating an importance of aa Trp156 in cytokine–cytokine receptor interaction (Fig. 5B). To analyze biological activity of hp40–p19W156A, we used Ba/F3 cells expressing human IL-23R and human IL-12Rβ1. Surprisingly, Ba/F3-hIL-12Rβ1-hIL-23R cells stimulated with hp40–p19W156A induced cellular proliferation and STAT3/ERK phosphorylation (Fig. 5, C and D). This finding indicates that hp40–p19W156A still interacts with hIL-23R in a cellular system. Further, we analyzed the corresponding amino acid site"

Besides nervous system, the nonneuronal functions of cholinergic system have been proposed in various tissues. The expression of cholinergic proteins and release of acetylcholine in human skin have been reported, but its mechanism and influence on dermatological functions is not elucidated. Here, the expression profile of cholinergic markers was further investigated in skin and keratinocyte. The expression levels of choline acetyltransferase (ChAT), acetylcholinesterase (AChE), vesicular acetylcholine transporter (VAChT), and synaptophysin, were upregulated during differentiation of keratinocytes. In cultured keratinocytes, a transient exposure of solar light induced the release of acetylcholine, which was mediated by intracellular Ca2+ mobilization. The light-induced acetylcholine release was mediated by the present of opsin. The light-induced melanogenesis was inhibited by acetylcholine or AChE inhibitor in melanocyte in vitro and mouse skin ex vivo. These results indicated that the potential role of cholinergic system could be a negative regulator in skin pigmentation."
https://openalex.org/W3033274294,"Study aim Rates of out of hospital cardiac arrest are higher in deprived communities. Bystander Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (BCPR) can double the chance of survival but occurs less often in these communities in comparison to more affluent communities. People living in deprived communities are, therefore, doubly disadvantaged and there is limited evidence to explain why BCPR rates are lower. The aim of this paper is to examine the barriers to administering BCPR in deprived communities. Method Mixed method qualitative study with ten single sex focus groups (n = 61) conducted in deprived communities across central Scotland and 18 semi-structured interviews with stakeholders from the UK, Europe and the USA. Results Two key themes related to confidence and environmental factors were identified to summarise the perceived barriers to administering BCPR in deprived communities. Barriers related to confidence included: self-efficacy; knowledge and awareness of how, and when, to administer CPR; accessing CPR training; having previous experience of administering BCPR; who required CPR; and whether the bystander was physically fit to give CPR. Environmental barriers focused on the safety of the physical environment in which people lived, and fear of reprisal from gangs or the police. Conclusions Barriers to administering BCPR identified in the general population are relevant to people living in deprived communities but are exacerbated by a range of contextual, individual and environmental factors. A one-size-fits-all approach is not sufficient to promote ‘CPR readiness’ in deprived communities. Future approaches to working with disadvantaged communities should be tailored to the local community."

To support resource management, the description of the spatiotemporal extent of fisheries is necessary, but often poorly understood due to the diffuse nature of effort, operated from numerous small wooden vessels. Here, in Gabon, Central Africa, we applied Hidden Markov Models to detect fishing patterns in seven different fisheries (with different gears) from GPS data. Models were compared to information collected by on-board observers (7 trips) and, at a larger scale, to a visual interpretation method (99 trips). Models utilizing different sampling resolutions of GPS acquisition were also tested. Model prediction accuracy was high with GPS data sampling rates up to three minutes apart. The minor loss of accuracy linked to model classification is largely compensated by the savings in time required for analysis, especially in a context of nations or organizations with limited resources. This method could be applied to larger datasets at a national or international scale to identify and more adequately manage fishing effort."
https://openalex.org/W3033987162,"Bacterial glycosphingolipids such as glucuronosylceramide and galactosylceramide have been identified as ligands for invariant natural killer T cells and play important roles in host defense. However, the glycosphingolipid synthases required for production of these ceramides have not been well-characterized. Here, we report the identification and characterization of glucuronosylceramide synthase (ceramide UDP-glucuronosyltransferase [Cer-GlcAT]) in Zymomonas mobilis, a Gram-negative bacterium whose cellular membranes contain glucuronosylceramide. On comparing the gene sequences that encode the diacylglycerol GlcAT in bacteria and plants, we found a homologous gene that is widely distributed in the order Sphingomonadales in the Z. mobilis genome. We first cloned the gene and expressed it in Escherichia coli, followed by protein purification using nickel–Sepharose affinity and gel filtration chromatography. Using the highly enriched enzyme, we observed that it has high glycosyltransferase activity with UDP-glucuronic acid and ceramide as sugar donor and acceptor substrate, respectively. Cer-GlcAT deletion resulted in a loss of glucuronosylceramide and increased the levels of ceramide phosphoglycerol, which was expressed in WT cells only at very low levels. Furthermore, we found sequences homologous to Cer-GlcAT in Sphingobium yanoikuyae and Bacteroides fragilis, which have been reported to produce glucuronosylceramide and α-galactosylceramide, respectively. We expressed the two homologs of the cer-glcat gene in E. coli and found that each gene encodes Cer-GlcAT and Cer-galactosyltransferase, respectively. These results contribute to the understanding of the roles of bacterial glycosphingolipids in host–bacteria interactions and the function of bacterial glycosphingolipids in bacterial physiology."
https://openalex.org/W3033270146,"Neuroimaging-driven prediction of brain age, defined as the predicted biological age of a subject using only brain imaging data, is an exciting avenue of research. In this work we seek to build models of brain age based on functional connectivity while prioritizing model interpretability and understanding. This way, the models serve to both provide accurate estimates of brain age as well as allow us to investigate changes in functional connectivity which occur during the ageing process. The methods proposed in this work consist of a two-step procedure: first, linear latent variable models, such as PCA and its extensions, are employed to learn reproducible functional connectivity networks present across a cohort of subjects. The activity within each network is subsequently employed as a feature in a linear regression model to predict brain age. The proposed framework is employed on the data from the CamCAN repository and the inferred brain age models are further demonstrated to generalize using data from two open-access repositories: the Human Connectome Project and the ATR Wide-Age-Range."

In this large retrospective cohort study of patients aged over 70 seen by the pre-dialysis clinic (2004-2016) of a large single centre in the United Kingdom (1,216 patients), age, sex, comorbidity, poverty and frailty were used to predict choice of renal replacement therapy (RRT) over maximum conservative management (MCM). The impact of patient choice of RRT versus MCM was used to predict survival from the time of choice using multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression. Older age, female sex, greater poverty and greater frailty were associated with choosing MCM, whilst comorbidity had no significant impact on choice. At 5 years of follow up, 49% of all patients had died without receiving RRT. Over 70% of the patients choosing MCM died with better kidney function than the median level at which those starting RRT initiated treatment. Frailty and age were better predictors of survival than comorbidity and in patients with at least moderate frailty, RRT offered no survival benefit over MCM. In conclusion, analysing outcomes from the time of choice may improve shared decision making. Frailty should be routinely assessed and collected and further work may help predict which patients are unlikely to survive or progress to end stage renal disease and may not need to be burdened with making a pre-dialysis choice."

In humans, it causes acute febrile illnesses like influenza, pneumonia, hepatitis, and chronic illnesses such as endocarditis, vascular infection, and post-infectious fatigue syndrome. It is widely distributed worldwide, and its main reservoirs are sheep, goats, and cattle. This study aimed to determine the frequency of C. burnetii infection using molecular detection and to identify the associated factors in livestock farmers and cattle from the Magdalena Medio region of Antioquia, Colombia. Using real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR), molecular detection was performed for the IS1111 insertion sequence of C. burnetii using genomic DNA collected from the peripheral blood of 143 livestock farmers and 192 cattle from 24 farms located in Puerto Berrío, Puerto Nare, and Puerto Triunfo. To confirm the results, bidirectional amplicon sequencing of 16S rRNA was performed in four of the positive samples. Additionally, factors associated with C. burnetii were identified using a Poisson regression with cluster effect adjustment. Real-time PCR showed positive results in 25.9% and 19.5% of livestock farmer samples and cattle samples, respectively. For livestock farmers, factors associated with C. burnetii were the area where the farm was located [Puerto Berrío, adjusted prevalence ratio (aPR): 2.13, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.10–4.11], presence of hens (aPR: 1.47, 95% CI: 1.21–1.79), horses (aPR: 1.61, 95% CI: 1.54–1.67), and ticks (aPR: 2.36, 95% CI: 1.03–5.42) in the residence, and consumption of raw milk (aPR: 1.47, 95% CI: 1.26–1.72). For cattle, the factors associated with Coxiella genus were municipality (Puerto Nare; aPR: 0.39, 95% CI: 0.37–0.41) and time of residence on the farm (≥49 months; aPR: 2.28, 95% CI: 1.03–5.20). By analyzing sequences of the 16S rRNA molecular marker, C. burnetii infection was confirmed in livestock farmers. However, in cattle, only the presence of Coxiella-type bacteria was identified. Further research is necessary to determine the potential role that these types of bacteria have as etiological agents for disease in livestock farmers and cattle from the study area."

These include malaria during the colonization of the archipelago by the Portuguese explorers and several arboviruses such as yellow fever (now eradicated), dengue and zika. To control these vector-borne diseases, an integrated vector control program was implemented. The main targeted mosquito vectors are Aedes aegypti and Anopheles arabiensis, and in a lesser extent the potential arbovirus vector Culex pipiens s.l. The main control strategy is focused on mosquito aquatic stages using diesel oil and Temephos. This latter has been applied in Cabo Verde since 1979. Its continuous use was followed by the emergence of resistance in mosquito populations. We investigated the current susceptibility to Temephos of the three potential mosquito vectors of Cabo Verde through bioassays tests. Our results showed various degrees of susceptibility with 24h post-exposure mortality rates ranging from 43.1% to 90.9% using WHO diagnostic doses. A full susceptibility was however observed with Bacillus thurigiensis var israelensis with mortality rates from 99.6% to 100%."

Although several signaling pathways and critical factors that regulate liver specification, differentiation, and proliferation have been identified, little is known about how liver maturation is regulated. Here, we used a screen for mutations affecting liver development in zebrafish and identified a cq96 mutant that exhibits a specific defect in liver maturation. Results from positional cloning revealed that cq96 encodes an RNA-binding protein, Rbm15, which is an evolutionarily conserved Spen family protein and known to play a crucial role in RNA m6A modification, nuclear export, and alternative splicing. However, a function of Rbm15 in embryonic liver development has not been reported. We found that Rbm15 is specifically expressed in the liver after its differentiation. CRISPR/Cas9-mediated loss of rbm15 repressed hepatic maturation, but did not affect hepatoblast specification, differentiation, and hepatocyte proliferation and apoptosis. Additional experiments disclosed that the mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) pathway is highly activated in rbm15-deficient hepatocytes. Moreover, rapamycin treatment partially restored normal hepatic gene expression as well as the nuclear location of the transcription factor Hnf4a.

CRISPR/Cas9-mediated loss of rbm15 repressed hepatic maturation, but did not affect hepatoblast specification, differentiation, and hepatocyte proliferation and apoptosis. Additional experiments disclosed that the mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) pathway is highly activated in rbm15-deficient hepatocytes. Moreover, rapamycin treatment partially restored normal hepatic gene expression as well as the nuclear location of the transcription factor Hnf4a. Taken together, these results reveal an unexpected role of Rbm15 in liver maturation. The liver is the biggest digestive organ of the body and plays a central role in metabolism and systemic homeostasis. It mainly consists of hepatocytes, stellate cells, macrophages, sinusoidal endothelial cells, and cholangiocytes (1Berasain C. Avila M.A. Regulation of hepatocyte identity and quiescence.Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2015; 72 (26089250): 3831-385110.1007/s00018-015-1970-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The hepatocyte is the most populous cell of the liver; nearly 80% of hepatic cells are hepatocytes. It undertakes multiple physiological functions, such as bile secretion, glycol metabolism, lipid storage, protein secretion, and detoxification (2Gordillo M. Evans T. Gouon-Evans V.

Therefore, it is crucial to understand the mechanisms underlying liver development using animal models. Although the molecular regulation on liver organogenesis is starting to be unraveled, the critical factors to regulate liver development specifically have not been completely known. In zebrafish, hepatogenesis can be divided into two steps. In the first stage, mesoderm around foregut endoderm induces hepatic precursor's proliferation and migration out from the gut endoderm and then specification to hepatoblast. Multiple layers of hepatoblast and the surrounding septum transversum form the liver bud. This progress lasts from 24 h post-fertilization (hpf) to 34 hpf (3Field H.A. Ober E.A. Roeser T. Stainier D.Y. Formation of the digestive system in zebrafish. I. Liver morphogenesis.Dev. Biol. 2003; 253 (12645931): 279-29010.1016/S0012-1606(02)00017-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Mesoderm-derived FGF, WNT, and BMP signaling orchestrate this progress (4Calmont A. Wandzioch E. Tremblay K.D. Minowada G. Kaestner K.H. Martin G.R. Zaret K.S.

In the second stage, hepatoblast proliferates, differentiates, and maturates into hepatocytes and cholangiocytes, eventually forming a functional liver (2Gordillo M. Evans T. Gouon-Evans V.

In this progress, Wnt signaling is the key regulator during liver formation via increasing cell proliferation and repressing apoptosis (10Tan X. Behari J. Cieply B. Michalopoulos G.K. Monga S.P.

The Hippo/YAP pathway is crucial for liver size control; hyper-YAP1 activity in the liver stimulates hepatocyte and cholangiocyte specification, whereas loss of YAP1 decreases hepatocyte survival and impairs biliary duct morphogenesis (12Yimlamai D.

The mTOR pathway is also involved in liver development (19Chaturantabut S. Shwartz A. Evason K.J. Cox A.G. Labella K. Schepers A.G. Yang S. Acuna M. Houvras Y. Mancio-Silva L. Romano S. Gorelick D.A.

Although many mechanisms underlying the hepatic fate decisions in vivo and in vitro have been reported, the key transcriptional factors that regulate hepatocyte maturation have been addressed less. Rbm15 is an evolutionarily conserved Spen family protein involved in cell fate decisions. It can bind to RNA and recruit other proteins to specific binding sites to regulate post-transcriptional modification (20Tran N.T. Su H. Khodadadi-Jamayran A. Lin S. Zhang L. Zhou D. Pawlik K.M. Townes T.M. Chen Y. Mulloy J.C. Zhao X. The AS-RBM15 lncRNA enhances RBM15 protein translation during megakaryocyte differentiation.EMBO Rep. 2016; 17 (27118388): 887-90010.15252/embr.201541970Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In mice, RBM15 regulates megakaryocyte terminal differentiation by affecting alternative RNA splicing of a group of genes such as Gata1, C-mpl, Runx1, and Tal1, which are important for megakaryopoiesis (21Zhang L. Tran N.T. Su H. Wang R. Lu Y. Tang H. Aoyagi S. Guo A. Khodadadi-Jamayran A. Zhou D. Qian K. Hricik T. Cote J. Han X.

RBM15 can bind to specific sites in the intron of pre-mRNA, recruit SF3B1 to the splicing region, and facilitate alternative RNA splicing in different developmental stages (21Zhang L. Tran N.T. Su H. Wang R. Lu Y. Tang H. Aoyagi S. Guo A. Khodadadi-Jamayran A. Zhou D. Qian K. Hricik T. Cote J. Han X. Zhou W. et al.Cross-talk between PRMT1-mediated methylation and ubiquitylation on RBM15 controls RNA splicing.eLife. 2015; 4 (26575292): e0793810.7554/eLife.07938Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). RBM15 can affect promoter activity of Notch target genes, such as Hes1, in a cell-specific manner. It can repress the expression of Notch-induced gene Hes1 in nonhematopoietic cells but enhance the Hes1 mRNA level in hematopoietic cell lines (22Ma X. Renda M.J. Wang L. Cheng E.C. Niu C. Morris S.W. Chi A.S. Krause D.S. Rbm15 modulates Notch-induced transcriptional activation and affects myeloid differentiation.Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 27 (17283045): 3056-306410.1128/MCB.01339-06Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). RBM15 can also affect hematopoietic stem cell and megakaryocyte development via regulating c-myc expression (23Niu C. Zhang J. Breslin P. Onciu M. Ma Z. Morris S.W. c-Myc is a target of RNA-binding motif protein 15 in the regulation of adult hematopoietic stem cell and megakaryocyte development.Blood. 2009; 114 (19542301): 2087-209610.1182/blood-2009-01-197921Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). m6A is the most widespread RNA modification; the establishment of m6A relies on RBM15 (24Knuckles P.

RBM15 is also involved in RNA nuclear export (26Zolotukhin A.S. Uranishi H. Lindtner S. Bear J. Pavlakis G.N. Felber B.K. Nuclear export factor RBM15 facilitates the access of DBP5 to mRNA.Nucleic Acids Res. 2009; 37 (19786495): 7151-716210.1093/nar/gkp782Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). However, the role of Rbm15 in liver development is unknown. Zebrafish has been developed into a popular model organism in recent years because of advantages of their transparent embryos developing outside of the mother, allowing constant visualization, and 69% of all zebrafish genes have a clear human orthologue (27Goessling W. Sadler K.C. Zebrafish: an important tool for liver disease research.Gastroenterology. 2015; 149 (26319012): 1361-137710.1053/j.gastro.2015.08.034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). High genetic conservation among vertebrates makes zebrafish an excellent model system to study liver development and disease (27Goessling W. Sadler K.C. Zebrafish: an important tool for liver disease research.Gastroenterology. 2015; 149 (26319012): 1361-137710.1053/j.gastro.2015.08.034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 28Chu J.

Here we used chemical mutagenesis to screen genes involved in liver development and got a specific liver maturation mutant, cq96. The mutant cq96 revealed normal liver specification, differentiation, and outgrowth, but the liver maturation was repressed. The development of the pancreas and intestine showed normal in cq96 mutant. Positional cloning and knockout experiments confirmed this mutation site located in gene rbm15. Deficiency of Rbm15 leads to up-regulation of the activity of mTORC1 signaling, and inhibition of the mTORC1 pathway by rapamycin can rescue liver maturation defect. Furthermore, the treatment of rapamycin enhanced the nuclear import of Hnf4a and restored hepatic gene expression. Our data revealed an unexpected function of rbm15 in liver development in zebrafish. We have screened mutagenized zebrafish larvae using transgenic line Tg(lfabp:Dendra2-NTR) (29He J. Lu H. Zou Q. Luo L. Regeneration of liver after extreme hepatocyte loss occurs mainly via biliary transdifferentiation in zebrafish.Gastroenterology. 2014; 146 (24315993): 789-800.e810.1053/j.gastro.2013.11.045Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) and identified the cq96 mutant. At 5 dpf, this mutant showed normal body morphology but weaker Dendra2 expression (Fig. 1A). The confocal image exhibited relatively normal liver size but heterogeneous Dendra2 expression in the mutant (Fig. 1B). The expressions of digestive organ–specific markers trypsin (exocrine pancreas) and ifabp (intestine) were normal, but the hepatocyte-specific gene cp was repressed (Fig. 1C). The expressions of functional markers of hepatocytes such as uox, gc, and gys2 were repressed in the mutant (Fig. 1D and Fig. S1 (A and B)). These data indicate that the cq96 mutant specifically affects liver development and especially regulates liver maturation. To determine the target gene of the cq96 mutant, we performed genome mapping and placed the cq96 mutation site locus to gene rbm15. The genomic sequencing result showed that there are 347 bp deleted in rbm15 exon 1, leading to translation into a truncated peptide (Fig. 2, A and B). To further confirm that rbm15 affects liver maturation, we generated a new rbm15 mutant by CRISPR/Cas9 that resembled the cq96 phenotype (Fig. 2, A–F). These results revealed that the mutation gene of cq96 is rbm15. Furthermore, rbm15 expressed in the liver region from 4 dpf and much stronger at 5 dpf (Fig. 2D). The weak expressions of Dendra2 and hepatic maturation markers such as uox and cp in cq96 mutant can be rescued by using Rbm15 overexpression line Tg(hsp70l:rbm15-Flagcq97) (Fig. 2, E–G). These results suggested that the mutation gene in cq96 is rbm15. To evaluate hepatoblast specification in the rbm15 mutant, we assayed the expression of transcriptional factors important for hepatoblast formation and specification at 60 hpf. Interestingly, the expressions of prox1, gata6, hhex, and foxa3 were not greatly different between mutants and siblings (Fig. 3A). This means that liver specification was normal in the cq96 mutant. Then we performed antibody staining for hepatic factors Hnf4a and Prox1 at 5 dpf. The nuclear signal for Hnf4a and Prox1 was much weaker compared with siblings (Fig. 3, B–E). These results suggest that the cq96 mutant has liver maturation rather than liver specification defects. To investigate the underlying mechanism of liver development defect in cq96 mutant, we performed antibody staining for PCNA, which labeled cells outside of the G0 phase. We detected a similar ratio of PCNA and Dendra2 double-positive cells in siblings and mutants (Fig. 4, A and B). To assess whether cell death contributes to liver development defect in cq96 mutant, we performed a transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) assay on WT and cq96 at 5 dpf. Larval hepatocytes presented a low apoptotic index at 5 dpf, which was unchanged in cq96 mutant (Fig. 4C). Therefore, liver development defect in the cq96 mutant does not appear to be due to defective cell proliferation and apoptosis. Hyper- and hypoactivated mTORC1 pathway will impair normal liver development (30Wang Z. Song J. Luo L. Ma J. Loss of leucyl-tRNA synthetase B leads to ILFS1-like symptoms in zebrafish.Biochem.

To explore whether the loss of rbm15 will affect the mTORC1 signaling or not, we performed antibody staining to check the expression level of p-4Ebp1, which indicates the activity of mTORC1 signaling, and found that the rbm15−/− mutant larvae showed high p-4Ebp1 level in the liver (Fig. 5A). This indicates that the mTORC1 pathway was hyperactivated in the rbm15−/− liver. To further confirm that the liver maturation defect in the rbm15 mutant was caused by mTORC1 activation, we used 10 μm rapamycin to inhibit mTORC1 from 5 to 7 dpf. mTORC1 inhibition can partially rescue the developmental liver defect (Fig. 5 (B and C) and Fig. S2A). After rapamycin treatment, the protein level of Hnf4a in mutant hepatocyte was rescued (Fig. 5, D and E), but the mRNA level of hnf4a showed no big difference between WT, rbm15−/−, and sample groups (Fig. S2B). Furthermore, the expressions of hepatocyte-specific genes such as cp and gc were also restored after rapamycin treatment (Fig. 5F). These results indicate that inhibition of mTORC1 can partially rescue liver maturation defects in rbm15 mutant. We have described a liver developmental mutant caused by rbm15 mutation, and inhibition of mTORC1 was an efficient strategy to rescue hepatic maturation defects. We showed that loss of Rbm15 specifically affected hepatic maturation, but not the developmental progress of intestine, pancreas. The mutant liver exhibited relative normal proliferation and apoptosis but weak hepatic gene expression. The two important hepatic transcriptional factors Hnf4a and Prox1 exhibited weak nuclear location, which could explain why rbm15 mutant showed hepatic maturation defects to some degree. Liver failure caused by rbm15 mutation also showed abnormal mTORC1 activation. Inhibition of mTORC1 can partially recover hepatic gene expression; this progress may rely on the enhancement of Hnf4a nuclear import. Rbm15 is an important post-transcriptional regulator involved in RNA nuclear export, m6A modification, and alternative splicing (21Zhang L. Tran N.T. Su H. Wang R. Lu Y. Tang H. Aoyagi S. Guo A.

Our finding first reveals that rbm15 is essential for hepatic maturation and that loss of rbm15-induced liver developmental failure partially depends on aberrant high mTORC1 activation. We point out the importance of rbm15 in hepatic maturation, but we still do not know the target genes of rbm15. The relationship between rbm15 deficiency and high mTORC1 activity is still a mystery. RNA immunoprecipitation sequencing experiments will be indispensable to further answer these questions.

Full-length rbm15 cDNA was amplified by PrimeSTAR HS DNA Polymerase (Takara) and cloned into pBluescript vector. The full-length rbm15-Flag CDS was driven by hsp70l promoter, and the plasmid was injected into AB strain embryos to generate the transgenic line Tg(hsp70l:rbm15-Flag)cq97. Positive embryos showed cerulean expression in the eyes of the offspring. Embryos were treated with 10 μm rapamycin (Sangon Biotech, Shanghai, China) in PTU egg water from 5 to 7 dpf and replaced rapamycin solution every 24 h. The control group was treated with 0.2% DMSO. To induce rbm15 overexpression from Tg(hsp70l:rbm15-Flag)cq97, larvae were placed in egg water and then incubated in a 38.5 °C water bath for 30 min once a day from 5 to 7 dpf. All images were taken on a SteREO DiscoveryV20 microscope (Carl Zeiss, Germany) and LSM880 confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss). The intensities of fluorescent images were measured with ImageJ.

https://openalex.org/W3033245764,"Background Despite a growing global commitment to universal health coverage, considerable vaccine coverage and uptake gaps persist in resource-constrained settings. One way of addressing the gaps is by ensuring product innovation is relevant and responsive to the needs of these contexts. Total Systems Effectiveness (TSE) framework has been developed to characterize preferred vaccine attributes from the perspective of country decision-makers to inform research and development (R&D) of products. A proof of concept pilot study took place in Thailand in 2018 to examine the feasibility and usefulness of the TSE approach using a rotavirus hypothetical test-case. Methods The excel-based model used multiple-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) to compare and evaluate five hypothetical rotavirus vaccine products. The model was populated with local data and products were ranked against decision criteria identified by Thai stakeholders. A one-way sensitivity analysis was performed to identify criteria that influenced vaccine ranking. Self-assessment forms were distributed to R&D stakeholders on the usability of the approach and were subsequently analysed. Results The model identified significant parameters that impacted on MCDA rankings. Self-assessment forms revealed that TSE was perceived as being able to encourage closer collaboration between country decision makers and vaccine developers. Conclusions The pilot study demonstrates that it is feasible to use an MCDA approach to elicit stakeholder preferences and determine influential parameters to help identify the preferred product characteristics for R&D from the perspective of country decision-makers. It found that TSE can help steer manufacturers to develop products that are better aligned with country need. Findings will guide further development of the TSE concept."

In this study, we aimed to examine the effect of gossypol supplementation on fermentation characteristics, bacterial α-diversity and community structure in the rumen fluid of sheep to analyse the change of bacterial in response to gossypol. 8 sheep with permanent fistula were randomly divided into 2 groups, a control and gossypol acetate supplementation groups. Sheep in the latter group were supplemented with gossypol acetate at the levels of 600 mg and 1,200 mg/animal per day during the first (S1, days 1 to 27) and subsequent (S2, days 28 to 47) stages. Gossypol supplementation significantly increased the molar proportion of acetate, and decreased the molar proportion of isobutyric acid, butyric acid, and isovaleric acid in the rumen fluid. Gossypol supplementation have no significant effect on bacterial diversity in the rumen fluid. At the phylum level, gossypol had no effect on bacterial community. At the genus level, gossypol supplementation significantly increased the relative abundance of Treponema_2. However, there were no significant differences in the relative abundance of dominant bacterial genera. In conclusion, gossypol supplementation had an effect on molar proportion of acetate, isobutyric acid, butyric acid, and isovaleric acid, but had no significant effect on the bacterial diversity and relative abundance of dominant bacteria in rumen fluid of sheep."

There is no study related to MBI from India. Methods and findings In this cross-sectional observational study 124 subjects 60 years and above were recruited between March 2017 to October 2018, from memory clinic of department of Geriatric medicine with memory or behavioural complains. Subjects with major neurocognitive impairment (CDR score of 1 or more), major depressive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder and impaired activities of daily living (ADL) were excluded. Subjects with Mild Cognitive impairment (MCI) (CDR- 0.5), and Subjective cognitive impairment (SCI) (CDR- 0) were included. Neuropsychiatric Inventory Questionnaire (NPI-Q) was used to identify the presence of NPS. The ISTAART-MBI (International Society of Advance Alzheimer’s Research and Treatment-Alzheimer’s Association) diagnostic criteria was used to diagnose MBI. All the participants underwent a geriatric assessment using standardised screening. The objectives of this study was to determine the frequency of mild behavioural impairment (MBI), and its domains, in MCI or SCI and its association with comorbidities and geriatric syndromes. The mean age of the participants was 69.21, 71.77% (89) were male and 28.23% (35) were female. 41.13% (51) of these individuals were diagnosed with MBI. The MBI and non MBI group differed significantly in marital status, cognitive status and MCI subtype. The proportion of domains involved are as follows: decreased motivation 60.78%(31), emotional dysregulation 54.90% (28), impulse dyscontrol 68.63% (35), social inappropriateness 21.57%(11), abnormal perception 2 (3.93%). Presence of multi-morbidity, and diabetes, were statistically significant between the groups. Conclusion This study presents the first clinic-based prevalence estimates of MBI from Asia. Findings indicate a relatively high prevalence of MBI in predementia clinical states, impulse dyscontrol was the most commonly involved MBI domain. Multimorbidity, diabetes, urinary incontinence were other determinants of MBI."
https://openalex.org/W3033645827,"The human telomerase gene (hTERT) is repressed in most somatic cells. How transcription factors activate the hTERT promoter in its repressive chromatin environment is unknown. Here, we report that the ETS family protein ETS variant transcription factor 5 (ETV5) mediates epidermal growth factor (EGF)-induced hTERT expression in MCF10A cells. This activation required MYC proto-oncogene bHLH transcription factor (c-Myc) and depended on the chromatin state of the hTERT promoter. Using chromatinized bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) reporters in human fibroblasts, we found that ETV5 and c-Myc/MYC-associated factor X (MAX) synergistically activate the hTERT promoter via two identical, but inverted, composite Ets/E-box motifs enclosing the core promoter. Mutations of Ets or E-box sites in either DNA motif abolished the activation and reduced or eliminated the synergism. ETV5 and c-Myc facilitated each other's binding to the hTERT promoter. ETV5 bound to the hTERT promoter in both telomerase-negative and -positive cells, but it activated the repressed hTERT promoter and altered histone modifications only in telomerase-negative cells. The synergistic ETV5/c-Myc activation disappeared when hTERT promoter repression became relieved because of the loss of distal regulatory elements in chimeric human/mouse BAC reporters. Our results suggest that the binding of c-Myc and ETS family proteins to the Ets/E-box motifs derepresses the hTERT promoter by inducing an active promoter configuration, providing a mechanistic insight into hTERT activation during tumorigenesis.

Telomeres are protective caps of chromosomes that limit human cell proliferation during replicative aging. In pluripotent stem cells and early embryonic tissues, telomeric repeats are replenished by telomerase, a nucleoprotein complex including an RNA template TERC and a catalytic telomerase reverse transcriptase TERT (1Cong Y.S. Wright W.E. Shay J.W. Human telomerase and its regulation.Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2002; 66 (12208997): 407-42510.1128/mmbr.66.3.407-425.2002Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar). The hTERT gene is, however, repressed in most adult tissues, resulting in low or undetectable telomerase activities in those tissues. Consequently, most somatic cells undergo progressive telomere shortening upon successful cell divisions, leading to cellular senescence. hTERT activation, as it occurs in the majority of cancers, results in telomerase activation and cellular immortalization. Regulation of the hTERT gene involves promoter-binding transcription factors (TFs) and its chromatin context that controls promoter accessibility. Our previous studies revealed that the hTERT gene was embedded in a nuclease-resistant chromatin domain and repressed by multiple HDAC1-containing corepressor complexes in human somatic cells (2Wang S.

These processes further increased the accessibility of the promoter, allowing the binding of additional TFs and the assembly of transcription machinery at the promoter.

In addition to the E-boxes, it was also reported that ETS family TFs were involved in hTERT regulation in cancer cells. Upon induction by EGF via the MAPK pathway, ETS2 activated hTERT transcription through Ets consensus sites (5′-TTCCTTTCCG-3′) at the −22 nt position upstream of the hTERT transcription start site (TSS) (13Maida Y.

In Ewing’s sarcomas, EWS fused with one of five ETS family members (FLI1, ERG, ETV1, E1AF, or PEA3) and up-regulated hTERT expression through the same Ets-binding sites (14Takahashi A. Higashino F.

These data indicated that ETS family proteins were critical for the regulation of hTERT promoter. However, it is worth mentioning that transiently transfected hTERT promoter reporters used in the aforementioned studies were missing a crucial downstream Ets/E-box motif at the +44 nt position. Recently, specific mutations at the hTERT core promoter, located at positions −69 nt (C250T), −48 nt (C228T), and +21 nt relative to the TSS, were found in multiple types of cancer and correlated with higher hTERT expression in cancer cells (16Horn S.

ETV5 was also able to bind to the C228T mutation site and activate the mutant hTERT promoter in GABP-negative thyroid cancer cells (29Bullock M. Lim G. Zhu Y. Åberg H. Kurdyukov S. Clifton-Bligh R. ETS factor ETV5 activates the mutant telomerase reverse transcriptase promoter in thyroid cancer.Thyroid. 2019; 29 (31452441): 1623-163310.1089/thy.2018.0314Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Here, we report that ETV5 is a critical factor in regulating hTERT transcription in human mammary epithelial cells and fibroblasts. To study how TFs activated the hTERT promoter in a relevant genomic context, we previously developed a chromatinized reporter system, in which single-copy BACs were integrated into proviral acceptor sites in human cells by recombination-mediated BAC targeting (RMBT) (30Wang S. Zhao Y. Leiby M.A. Zhu J. Studying human telomerase gene transcription by a chromatinized reporter generated by recombinase-mediated targeting of a bacterial artificial chromosome.Nucleic Acids Res. 2009; 37 (19528078): e11110.1093/nar/gkp511Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Using this system, we found that, whereas ETV5 bound to the hTERT promoter in both telomerase-negative (Tel−) and -positive (Tel+) human fibroblast cells, it activated the hTERT promoter only in Tel− cells. ETV5 cooperated with c-Myc to activate hTERT transcription via two identical composite Ets/E-box motifs, which surrounded the hTERT promoter symmetrically. The synergistic activation by ETV5 and c-Myc was attenuated or abolished when the Ets site or E-box in one of these motifs was mutated. ETV5 and c-Myc augmented each other’s binding to these two motifs. The activation of hTERT promoter by ETV5 was associated with histone acetylation and H3K4 methylation at the promoter. Altogether, our study indicated that ETV5 and c-Myc cooperated to relieve the hTERT promoter from repressive chromatin via two Ets/E-box motifs, supporting a model that the binding of ETS and c-Myc family proteins to the hTERT promoter led to the establishment of an active promoter configuration. To identify genes involved in human cell immortalization, we performed a proviral tagging experiment in pre-crisis 3C cells. 3C cells were a clonal strain of SV40 large T antigen–transformed IMR90 cells and underwent crisis after a finite number of population doublings due to telomere exhaustion (31Wang S. Zhu J. Evidence for a relief of repression mechanism for activation of the human telomerase reverse transcriptase promoter.J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278 (12611896): 18842-1885010.1074/jbc.M209544200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Following the infection of 3C cells with a replication-deficient retrovirus, MFG, individual immortal clones were isolated, and genomic DNAs were extracted. The proviral integration sites in these clones were determined by inverse PCR and sequencing. In one clone, a provirus integrated in the first intron of the ETV5 gene and resulted in its overexpression (data not shown), suggesting that ETV5 facilitated telomere maintenance and cellular immortalization. The possibility that ETV5 regulated hTERT expression was tested in human epithelial MCF10A cells, which proliferated in an EGF-dependent manner. As shown in Fig. 1 (A–C), EGF induced the expression of ETV5 and hTERT mRNAs, as well as telomerase activity, in these cells. To understand the role of ETV5 in hTERT regulation, MCF10A cells were transduced with lentiviral small hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) against ETV5, followed by EGF treatment. Reverse transcription and quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) and Western analyses showed that the shRNAs against ETV5 reduced its expression (Fig. 1, D and E). EGF-induced hTERT mRNA expression and telomerase activity also decreased upon ETV5 knockdown (KD), indicating the involvement of ETV5 in hTERT up-regulation by EGF (Fig. 1, F and G). In addition, the hTERT mRNA level was also elevated upon ETV5 overexpression in the absence of EGF (Fig. 1H). These data suggested that ETV5 mediated hTERT activation by EGF in MCF10A cells. ETV5 overexpression also activated hTERT expression in telomerase-negative fibroblast cells, GM847 (Fig. 2A). To study the role of ETV5 in hTERT activation in a relevant chromatin context, we utilized chromatinized single-copy BAC reporters that were integrated into GM847.7 cells (referred as Tel− cells), a clone of GM847 cells containing a single proviral BAC acceptor, via RMBT (30Wang S. Zhao Y. Leiby M.A. Zhu J. Studying human telomerase gene transcription by a chromatinized reporter generated by recombinase-mediated targeting of a bacterial artificial chromosome.Nucleic Acids Res. 2009; 37 (19528078): e11110.1093/nar/gkp511Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The integrated BAC reporter H(wt), containing the entire hTERT locus and its neighboring loci CRR9 and XTRP2 (Fig. 2B), recapitulated the native chromatin context in the host cells and provided a system for studying the complex transcriptional regulation of hTERT gene (7Cheng D.

ETV5 overexpression in Tel− cells induced hTERT promoter activity (Fig. 2C). The hTERT promoter in a similarly chromatinized H(wt) in normal human fibroblasts (NHFs) was also activated by ETV5 (Fig. 2D). The ETS family TFs are characterized by their Ets DNA-binding domains (DBDs). Their DNA-binding activities are often regulated by amino acid sequences around the DBDs (32Bojović B.B. Hassell J.A. The PEA3 Ets transcription factor comprises multiple domains that regulate transactivation and DNA binding.J. Biol.

It was reported that an N-terminal domain negatively regulated ETV5 transactivation (34Degerny C. de Launoit Y. Baert J.L. ERM transcription factor contains an inhibitory domain which functions in sumoylation-dependent manner.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2008; 1779 (18243147): 183-19410.1016/j.bbagrm.2008.01.002Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), whereas a C-terminal domain mediated ETV5 protein degradation by the E26 proteasome (35Baert J.L. Beaudoin C. Monte D. Degerny C. Mauen S. de Launoit Y. The 26S proteasome system degrades the ERM transcription factor and regulates its transcription-enhancing activity.Oncogene. 2007; 26 (16832340): 415-42410.1038/sj.onc.1209801Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Hence, three ETV5 plasmids were constructed by deleting one or both inhibitory domains: ΔN, ΔC, and ΔNC (missing amino acids 72-298, 484-510, and both regions, respectively) (Fig. 2E). Whereas ΔC augmented ETV5’s expression level, likely due to increased protein stability, ΔN and ΔNC enhanced ETV5’s abilities to activate hTERT promoter (Fig. 2, F and G). Multiple Ets consensus binding sites were found at the hTERT promoter, including two Ets consensus sites (GGAA), at −169 and +50 nt relative to TSS (Fig. 3A). To determine the roles of these sites in hTERT transcription, each of these sites in the BAC reporter H(wt) were mutated to generate H(etsU) and H(etsD). Each of these mutations reduced hTERT promoter activities in both Tel+ and Tel− cells (Figs. 3B). The ability of ETV5 to activate the mutant promoters was also impaired (Fig. 3C), indicating that both Ets sites were required for ETV5 activation. Each of these two Ets sites is juxtaposed to an E-box, the binding site for basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) family TFs, such as c-Myc/Max (9Zhao Y. Cheng D. Wang S. Zhu J. Dual roles of c-Myc in the regulation of hTERT gene.Nucleic Acids Res. 2014; 42 (25170084): 10385-1039810.1093/nar/gku721Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In fact, these sequences form two identical motifs (GCTTCCCACGTG), at positions −171 and +44 bp, surrounding the hTERT promoter symmetrically (Fig. 3A). hTERT promoter activity was reduced 40% by a mutation of the upstream E-box in H(eboxU) and 6-fold by a downstream E-box mutation in H(eboxD) in Tel+ cells (Fig. 3B). Interestingly, the ability of full-length ETV5 and ETV5ΔNC to activate the mutant promoters of H(eboxU) and H(eboxD) was diminished in Tel− cells (Fig. 3D), indicating that the E-boxes were also involved in hTERT regulation by ETV5. To explore possible interaction between ETV5 and c-Myc, lentiviral shRNAs against c-Myc and ETV5 were transduced into MCF10A cells, and hTERT mRNA induction by EGF was determined. As shown in Fig. 4A, hTERT mRNA expression decreased following inhibition of either c-Myc or ETV5, but its level did not decline further upon KD of both c-Myc and ETV5, suggesting that two TFs cooperate to activate hTERT expression. In Tel− cells with chromatinized H(wt), c-Myc and ETV5/ETV5ΔNC each activated the hTERT promoter. Co-expression of c-Myc/ETV5 or c-Myc/ETV5ΔNC synergistically stimulated the hTERT promoter (Fig. 4B). Co-transfection of a Max-expressing plasmid further increased hTERT promoter activity. Thus, ETV5 and c-Myc/Max cooperated to regulate hTERT transcription. To determine whether the Ets/E-box motifs were involved in the cooperation between ETV5 and c-Myc, ETV5– and c-Myc–expressing plasmids were transfected into Tel− cells with chromatinized H(etsU) and H(etsD). As shown in Fig. 4C, mutation of the downstream Ets site in H(etsD) completely abolished hTERT promoter activation by c-Myc and ETV5, either alone or together. Mutation of the upstream Ets site in H(etsU) also eliminated the activation by ETV5 and c-Myc, but ETV5ΔNC and c-Myc together activated the mutant promoter, albeit at a lower level compared with the WT promoter. Parallel experiments using H(eboxU) and H(eboxD) also showed that both the upstream and downstream E-boxes were required for synergistic activation by ETV5 and c-Myc (Fig. 4D). Next, electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) were performed to assess the binding of ETV5 and c-Myc proteins to the upstream and downstream Ets/E-box motifs. As shown in Fig. 5 (A–C), biotinylated probes containing either Ets/E-box motif formed three bands upon incubation with 293FT nuclear extracts. The intensities of the middle band increased upon overexpression of either c-Myc or ETV5, indicating that this band was the specific c-Myc/ETV5/DNA complex. The middle band also diminished in the presence of excess unlabeled WT, but not scrambled, probes as competitors, suggesting that c-Myc and ETV5 bound directly to these motifs. Thus, our data indicated that the Ets and E-box sites in both motifs mediated co-activation of the hTERT promoter by ETV5 and c-Myc. To determine whether cooperation between ETV5 and c-Myc depended on the adjoining Ets and E-box sites, unlabeled mutant competitors were used in EMSAs. Consistent with those in c-Myc– or ETV5–overexpressing cells, the same shifted complexes were detected upon incubation of 293FT cell nuclear lysates with biotinylated hTERT-U (Fig. 5D, lanes 2, 11, and 12). Inclusion of 10- or 5-fold unlabeled hTERT-U reduced the intensity of the DNA/protein complex (lanes 3 and 4). Similarly, the presence of unlabeled hTERT-U M1, containing an Ets site mutation, also competed for the binding with labeled probe (lanes 5 and 6). E-box mutation (M2) reduced its ability to compete for the complex formation (lanes 7 and 8), and mutations of both the Ets site and E-box (M3) further decreased this activity (lanes 9 and 10). A parallel EMSA experiment was also performed to test the downstream motif (hTERT-D). Mutation of either the Ets site or E-box reduced the abilities of unlabeled competitors to disrupt protein binding by biotinylated hTERT-D (Fig. 5E, lanes 5–8), and mutation of both sites further diminished this activity (lanes 9 and 10). Hence, coope"

These were then confirmed by tree building methods using COI and combined data (COI and 28S). We detected more than one MOTU in the morphospecies S. digitalis sp. nov., which can indicate genetic diversity. Detailed morphological evidence for each MOTU is provided to confirm these slight variations and we conclude that natural barriers are likely the main cause of genetic diversity."

Although S. aureus commonly forms part of the human microbiome as a commensal species, it also causes serious disease as an opportunistic pathogen in both nosocomial and community settings (2Wertheim H.F.

Expression of blaZ is regulated by two proteins: BlaR1 and BlaI. BlaR1 is a 69.3-kDa polytopic α-helical membrane protein with a predicted amino-terminal zinc-metalloprotease domain and carboxyl-terminal penicilloyl serine transferase extracellular domain that functions as a β-lactam sensor. BlaI is a transcriptional repressor that regulates the expression of blaI, blaR1, and blaZ by binding to the operator and restricting transcription of the divergon (10Zhang H.Z. Hackbarth C.J. Chansky K.M. Chambers H.F.

The mec divergon is closely analogous to the bla divergon with a sensor/transducer protein, MecR1, and a repressor protein MecI, both regulating the expression of pbp2a (11García-Castellanos R.

The close protein sequence identity of the corresponding proteins in the pathway (MecR1/BlaR1, 35%; MecI/BlaI, 61%) suggests the mec and bla pathways are similarly regulated and indeed, BlaR1 can regulate the mec pathway in the absence of MecR1 (12Hackbarth C.J.

Acylation of BlaR1/MecR1 sensor domains (here denoted BlaR1SD and MecR1SD, respectively) by a β-lactam antibiotic is hypothesized to activate the zinc metalloprotease domain of both proteins, leading to the cleavage of the repressor (BlaI/MecI). Searches of the PDB using the Dali server reveal BlaR1SD/MecR1SD most closely resemble the Ambler class D β-lactamases (13Holm L. Laakso L.M.

Both sensor domains have the three canonical catalytic motifs found in all penicillin-binding proteins and β-lactamases: SXXK, (S/Y/F)X(N/C), and (K/H)(S/T)G (15Lovering A.L. Safadi S.S.

Despite close structural similarity to OXA-10/48 both the sensor domains have an SXN motif instead of (Y/F)XN common in the class D β-lactamases (16Poirel L. Naas T. Nordmann P. Diversity, epidemiology, and genetics of class D β-lactamases.Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2010; 54 (19721065): 24-3810.1128/AAC.01512-08Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). The sole function of a β-lactamase is to hydrolyze β-lactam antibiotics as efficiently as possible, affording drug resistance to the pathogen. In contrast, BlaR1 and MecR1 function as receptors and therefore it is presumably advantageous to have a slow deacylation rate to allow signal propagation even in the presence of low concentrations of β-lactams. Although both class D β-lactamases and the sensor domains described here bind β-lactams, a key difference between the BlaR1/MecR1 sensor domains and β-lactamases is their deacylation rates. Deacylation in class D β-lactamases is thought to occur when the N-ζ carboxy-lysine of the SXXK motif abstracts a proton from the hydrolytic water (17Golemi D. Maveyraud L. Vakulenko S. Samama J.P. Mobashery S. Critical involvement of a carbamylated lysine in catalytic function of class D β-lactamases.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

This activated nucleophile then attacks the α-carbon of the acyl-enzyme intermediate, causing the enzyme to be regenerated (17Golemi D. Maveyraud L. Vakulenko S. Samama J.P. Mobashery S. Critical involvement of a carbamylated lysine in catalytic function of class D β-lactamases.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

The BlaR1 sensor domain has also been found to have a carboxylated SXXK motif lysine in the ligand-free form (18Borbulevych O. Kumarasiri M. Wilson B. Llarrull L.I. Lee M. Hesek D. Shi Q. Peng J.

However, lysine carboxylation is lost upon acylation of the BlaR1 SXXK motif serine (19Thumanu K. Cha J. Fisher J.F. Perrins R. Mobashery S. Wharton C.

The sensor domains are thought to retard the regeneration of the carboxy-lysine via hydrogen bonding between the N-ζ of the lysine and a nearby asparagine side chain (Asn-339 in BlaR1 and Asn-341 in MecR1) (18Borbulevych O.

Efforts to re-potentiate β-lactams rendered ineffective by the presence of the class A serine β-lactamases have been made using a combination therapy of β-lactam antibiotic and β-lactam–based β-lactamase inhibitor (21Docquier J.D. Mangani S. An update on β-lactamase inhibitor discovery and development.Drug Resist. Updat. 2018; 36 (29499835): 13-2910.1016/j.drup.2017.11.002Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Further research with diazabicyclooctane-based inhibitors led to the development of the first clinically used non-β-lactam β-lactamase inhibitor, avibactam (22Bonnefoy A. Dupuis-Hamelin C. Steier V. Delachaume C. Seys C. Stachyra T. Fairley M. Guitton M. Lampilas M. In vitro activity of AVE1330A, an innovative broad-spectrum non-β-lactam β-lactamase inhibitor.J. Antimicrob. Chemother. 2004; 54 (15254025): 410-41710.1093/jac/dkh358Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Once avibactam is carbamylated to the β-lactamase active site serine it has a very slow rate of decarbamylation (23Stachyra T. Péchereau M.C. Bruneau J.M. Claudon M. Frère J.M. Miossec C. Coleman K.

Furthermore, upon eventual processing, intact avibactam is produced instead of a hydrolyzed product as is found with conventional β-lactam–based β-lactamase inhibitors (Fig. 2) (23Stachyra T.

New broad-spectrum antibiotics are critically needed to allow treatment prior to the identification of the bacterial species causing the infection. Avibactam in combination with the β-lactam ceftazidime has since been approved in the United States by the FDA to treat complicated urinary tract infections, intra-abdominal infections, hospital-acquired bacterial pneumonia, and ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia (25Mosley F.F. Smith L.L. Parke C.K. Brown J.A. Wilson A.L. Gibbs L.V. Ceftazidime-avibactam.P.T. 2016; 41 (27504064): 479-483PubMed Google Scholar). Although ceftazidime/avibactam combination therapy is currently indicated in the treatment of Gram-negative organisms, studies have shown that combination therapy with ceftaroline and avibactam is additionally effective against clinical isolates of MRSA and pathogenic Gram-negative bacteria such as Enterobacteriaceae, P. aeruginosa, and Acinetobacter spp. suggesting avibactam could be useful in treating infections where the causative pathogen has yet to be identified or where a broad-spectrum antibiotic is needed (26Sader H.S.

Although avibactam has shown promise as a β-lactamase inhibitor, it has also been shown to influence transcription of the β-lactamase gene ampC found in Enterobacter cloacae with effects ranging from strong up-regulation of ampC transcription to no detectable up-regulation in other strains (29Miossec C. Cclaudon M. Levasseur P. Black M.T. Claudon M. Levasseur P. Black M.T. The β-lactamase inhibitor avibactam (NXL104) does not induce ampC β-lactamase in Enterobacter cloacae.Infect.

For these reasons we are interested whether avibactam, a non-β-lactam, can also activate the bla and mec pathways of MRSA in a similar way as for conventional β-lactam antibiotics or whether it inhibits these pathways by preventing β-lactams from binding. In this paper we show evidence that avibactam binds to the BlaR1SD and MecR1SD and up-regulates blaZ and pbp2a expression in the S. aureus SF8300, a USA300 clone. The USA300 MRSA clone is a leading cause of MRSA infections in the USA (31Thurlow L.R. Joshi G.S. Richardson A.R. Virulence strategies of the dominant USA300 lineage of community-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA).FEMS Immunol. Med.

Additionally, we use X-ray crystallography to visualize the molecular interactions between avibactam and the sensor domains of BlaR1 and MecR1. Although avibactam adopts a single conformation in MecR1SD, it is oriented in two, approximately equally occupied, conformations in the BlaR1SD active site. These findings have potential relevance for drug discovery efforts and MRSA treatment. Avibactam activates expression of the bla and mec divergons in S. aureus SF8300, a USA300 clone of MRSA (Fig. 3). S. aureus SF8300 lacks MecR1 from the mec divergon so pbp2a expression is under the control of BlaR1. Both pbp2a and blaZ mRNA transcripts were up-regulated by avibactam at concentrations of ≥8 µg ml−1 with further increased expression at 16, 32, and 64 µg ml−1. Expression levels of pbp2a and blaZ mRNA transcripts at 2 µg ml−1 were comparable with the DMSO control used. Avibactam binding to the BlaR1SD and MecR1SD affects their thermal stability differently. The thermal stability of the sensor domains was measured in the presence of a range of concentrations of different β-lactam antibiotics and avibactam using differential static light scattering. Avibactam appears to increase the thermal stability of MecR1SD by 2.6 °C, whereas minimally affecting BlaR1SD thermal stability (0.4 °C of stabilization) (Fig. 4). Similarly, nafcillin also appears to confer different effects on the two proteins, but with the opposite effect, stabilizing BlaR1SD but having little effect on MecR1SD. As expected, both sensor domains show an increase in ΔTagg when acylated by ampicillin and were not affected by the control antibiotic kanamycin for which they are not a target. BlaR1SD and MecR1SD avibactam X-ray crystallographic co-structures were solved to 2.0 and 1.6 Å resolution, respectively, with excellent statistics and no Ramachandran outliers (full data collection and refinement statistics shown in Table 1). BlaR1SD crystals were obtained in potassium citrate and PEG3350 at pH 8.1 while MecR1SD crystals formed in ammonium sulfate at pH 7.5. Avibactam was modeled with a total occupancy of 1 in both structures with clear electron density supporting modeled positions as shown by 2mFo − DFc maps (Fig. 5) and mFo − DFc volume omit maps (Fig. S1). In both structures avibactam is covalently bound to the catalytic serine of BlaR1 (Ser-389) or MecR1 (Ser-391) SXXK motifs with the C7 carbonyl group coordinated in the oxyanion hole by the backbone nitrogen atoms of Ser-389 and Thr-529 in BlaR1 (Ser-391 and Thr-531 in MecR1) (Fig. 5). Interactions between avibactam and BlaR1SD or MecR1SD are also depicted in figures created with LigPlot+ (Figs. S2–S4). Remarkably, avibactam is observed covalently bound in two alternate orientations to BlaR1SD, whereas in MecR1SD it is only present in one orientation (Fig. 5). Despite MecR1SD being co-crystallized initially with oxacillin (oxacillin was included to aid in the initial formation of crystals), the resulting electron density shows unequivocally that soaking with high concentrations of avibactam post-crystallization successfully displaced the oxacillin. Although backsoaking is a commonly used technique for hard to crystallize proteins, there is always the possibility that this method prevented a second conformation of avibactam binding. However, we do point out the close similarity of the MecR1SD ligand-free structure determined in a different space group, the prior oxacillin structure, and our avibactam structure here (Table 2) would suggest the latter's conformation is not being influenced or modulated by the initially present oxacillin.Table 1Data collection and structure refinement statistics for the BlaR1SD and MecR1SD in covalent complex with avibactamData collectionStructureBlaR1SD-avibactamMecR1SD-avibactamPDB ID6O9W6O9SBeamlineCLS-08ID-1CLS-08ID-1Space groupP1211P41212Cell dimensionsa, b, c (Å)53.4, 92.6, 56.558.7, 58.7, 147.6α, β, γ (°)90.0, 104.6, 90.090.0, 90.0, 90.0Wavelength (Å)0.97930.9794Resolution (Å)46.32-1.95 (2.02-1.95)1Highest resolution shell is shown in parentheses.45.93-1.59 (1.65-1.59)Rmerge0.094 (0.915)0.049 (0.502)CC1/20.997 (0.639)0.999 (0.812)I/σI10.05 (1.31)21.73 (2.59)Completeness (%)99.58 (99.51)99.1 (92.9)Redundancy3.4 (3.4)6.7 (4.4)RefinementResolution (Å)2.01.6No. reflections38,592 (3,840)35,297 (3,214)Rwork/Rfree0.185/0.2250.158/0.197No. Nonhydrogen atomsMacromolecules39842290Ligand/ion34/017/5Water168159B-factors (Å2)Protein39.827.2Ligand32.433.2Ion105.9Water41.338.3RMSDBond lengths (Å)0.0100.007Bond angles (°)1.020.95Favored/allowed/disallowed (%)97.4/2.6/0.098.0/2.1/0.01 Highest resolution shell is shown in parentheses.

In this study, sludge was converted to a magnetic adsorbent (MA) by adding ascorbate. The sludge was weakly magnetised in the amorphous form with Fe and Mn contents of 28.8% and 8.1%, respectively. After hydrothermal treatment, Fe/Mn oxides in the sludge was recrystallised to siderite and rhodochrosite, with jacobsite as the intermediate in the presence of ascorbate. With an increment in ascorbate dosage, the obtained magnetic adsorbent had a significant increase in chromate adsorption but a decrease in magnetisation. When the Mascorbate/MFe molar ratio was 10, the produced MA-10 was a dumbbell-shaped nanorod with a length of 2–5 μm and a diameter of 0.5–1 μm. This MA-10 showed 183.2 mg/g of chromate adsorption capacity and 2.81 emu/g of magnetisation. The mechanism of chromate adsorption was surface coprecipitation of the generated Cr3+ and Fe3+/Mn4+ from redox reaction between chromate and siderite/rhodochrosite on MA-10, separately. This study demonstrated an efficient recycling route of waste sludge from groundwater treatment to produce MA for treating chromate-bearing wastewater."
https://openalex.org/W3034125269,"Background Substantial inequality in neonatal mortality rates (NMR) remains in low- and middle-income countries to the detriment of disadvantaged subpopulations. In Ethiopia, there is a dearth of evidence on the extent and trends of disparity in NMR. This study assessed the socioeconomic, residence and sex-based inequalities in NMR, as well as examined its change over a sixteen year period in Ethiopia. Methods Using the World Health Organization’s (WHO) Health Equity Assessment Toolkit (HEAT) software, data from the Ethiopia Demographic and Health Surveys (EDHS) were analyzed between 2000 and 2016. NMR was disaggregated by four equity stratifiers: education, wealth, residence and sex. In addition, absolute and relative inequality measures, namely Difference, Population Attributable Risk (PAR), Ratio, Relative Concentration Index (RCI) and Slope Index of Inequality (SII) were calculated to understand inequalities from different perspectives. Corresponding 95% Uncertainty Intervals (UIs) were computed to measure statistical significance. Findings Large educational inequalities in NMR were found in 2000, 2005, and 2011, while wealth-driven inequality occurred in 2011. Sex disparity was noted in all the surveys, and urban-rural differentials remained in all the surveys except in 2016. While socioeconomic and area-related inequalities decreased over time, sex related inequality did not change during the period of study. Conclusions NMR appeared to be concentrated among male newborns, neonates born to illiterate and poor women and those living in rural settings. However, the inequality narrowed over time. Interventions appropriate for different subpopulations need to be designed."
https://openalex.org/W3027999390,"TOKs are outwardly rectifying K+ channels in fungi with two pore-loops and eight transmembrane spans. Here, we describe the TOKs from four pathogens that cause the majority of life-threatening fungal infections in humans. These TOKs pass large currents only in the outward direction like the canonical isolate from Saccharomyces cerevisiae (ScTOK), and distinct from other K+ channels. ScTOK, AfTOK1 (Aspergillus fumigatus), and H99TOK (Cryptococcus neoformans grubii) are K+-selective and pass current above the K+ reversal potential. CaTOK (Candida albicans) and CnTOK (Cryptococcus neoformans neoformans) pass both K+ and Na+ and conduct above a reversal potential reflecting the mixed permeability of their selectivity filter. Mutations in CaTOK and ScTOK at sites homologous to those that open the internal gates in classical K+ channels are shown to produce inward TOK currents. A favored model for outward rectification is proposed whereby the reversal potential determines ion occupancy, and thus, conductivity, of the selectivity filter gate that is coupled to an imperfectly restrictive internal gate, permitting the filter to sample ion concentrations on both sides of the membrane."

Here, we discovered a conserved multifunctional GH, SsGalNagA, containing a unique combination of two family 32 carbohydrate-binding modules (CBM), a GH16 domain and a GH20 domain, in the zoonotic pathogen Streptococcus suis 05ZYH33. Enzymatic assays revealed that the SsCBM-GH16 domain displays endo-(β1,4)-galactosidase activity specifically toward the host-derived αGal epitope Gal(α1,3)Gal(β1,4)Glc(NAc)-R, whereas the SsGH20 domain has a wide spectrum of exo-β-N-acetylhexosaminidase activities, including exo-(β1,3)-N-acetylglucosaminidase activity, and employs this activity to act in tandem with SsCBM-GH16 on the αGal-epitope glycan. Further, we found that the CBM32 domain adjacent to the SsGH16 domain is indispensable for SsGH16 catalytic activity. Surface plasmon resonance experiments uncovered that both CBM32 domains specifically bind to αGal-epitope glycan, and together they had a KD of 3.5 mm toward a pentasaccharide αGal-epitope glycan. Cell-binding and αGal epitope removal assays revealed that SsGalNagA efficiently binds to both swine erythrocytes and tracheal epithelial cells and removes the αGal epitope from these cells, suggesting that SsGalNagA functions in nutrient acquisition or alters host signaling in S. suis. Both binding and removal activities were blocked by an αGal-epitope glycan. SsGalNagA is the first enzyme reported to sequentially act on a glycan containing the αGal epitope.

To demonstrate this utility, we fused TTR to the C terminus of conatumumab, an antibody that targets tumor necrosis factor–related apoptosis-inducing ligand receptor 2, as heavy chains to form antibody dimers and Fab heavy chains to form Fab tetramers. Moreover, we used constant heavy domain 3 heterodimerization substitutions to create TTR-mediated conatumumab tetramers. The conatumumab–TTR fusions displayed substantially enhanced potency in cell-based assays, as well as in murine tumor xenograft models. We conclude that antibody–TTR fusions may provide a powerful platform for multimerizing antibody and Fab fragments to enhance the capabilities of human therapeutics that benefit from target clustering and higher-order antigen-binding valency.

TTR is a noncovalently associated homotetrameric protein that, unlike most serum proteins, does not contain any disulfide bonds or glycosylation. The tetramer of TTR is strongly associated and does not undergo thermal unfolding at less than 80 °C, which can be further enhanced by the addition of a single mutation to eliminate the mutually repulsive lysines at position 15 (14Hammarström P.

TTR has a single cysteine, which is often found as a mixed disulfide species with cysteine or GSH (15Zhang Q. Kelly J.W.

Other engineering strategies to multimerize DR5 and induce apoptosis without the requirement for cross-linking have been reported. TAS266 is an agonistic tetravalent construct containing four high-affinity single-variable domains that cluster DR5 molecules (32Papadopoulos K.P. Isaacs R. Bilic S. Kentsch K. Huet H.A. Hofmann M. Rasco D. Kundamal N. Tang Z. Cooksey J. Mahipal A. Unexpected hepatotoxicity in a phase I study of TAS266, a novel tetravalent agonistic Nanobody® targeting the DR5 receptor.Cancer Chemother.

Tetrameric anti-DR5 antibody constructs have also been generated by fusing single-chain variable fragments targeting DR5 with the tetramerization domain of p53 and human serum albumin (33Liu F. Si Y. Liu G. Li S. Zhang J. Ma Y. The tetravalent anti-DR5 antibody without cross-linking direct induces apoptosis of cancer cells.Biomed. Pharmacother. 2015; 70 (25776477): 41-4510.1016/j.biopha.2014.12.024Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). A comparison of antibody valency and epitope targeting demonstrated tetravalent constructs that bind two distinct DR5 epitopes showed more potent activity than bivalent antibodies or antibodies that target a single DR5 epitope (34Yang Y. Yeh S.H. Madireddi S. Matochko W.L. Gu C. Sanchez P.P. Ultsch M. Boenig G.D.L. Harris S.F. Leonard B. Scales S.J. Zhu J.W. Christensen E. Hang J.Q. Brezski R.J.

Nonantibody scaffolds for DR5 multimerization have also been explored. A DR5-targeting peptide was covalently coupled to a dextran scaffold fused to an Fc to generate a flexible multimeric construct that effectively inducted apoptosis (35Schneider H. Yanakieva D. Macarrón A. Deweid L. Becker B. Englert S. Avrutina O. Kolmar H. TRAIL-inspired multivalent dextran conjugates efficiently induce apoptosis upon DR5 receptor clustering.ChemBioChem. 2019; 20 (31206933): 3006-301210.1002/cbic.201900251Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Together, these different DR5-targeting molecules demonstrate formats that multimerize DR5 binding, especially in a tetravalent format, and can drive DR5-mediated apoptosis without the requirement for additional cross-linking. Both the N and C termini of TTR are exposed on the surface of the tetramer, making them amenable to fusion with proteins (Fig. 1). Here we used the natural tetramer forming ability of TTR to generate antibody dimers and Fab fragment tetramers with only modest modifications to TTR and no modifications to the antibody other than fusion of TTR to the C terminus of the antibody or Fab fragment. In addition, we were able to form antibody tetramers using TTR with the addition of two charged mutations in each Fc CH3 dimerization interface. These higher-order antibody and Fab molecules significantly increase the potency of Ab1 both in vitro and in vivo. The 2X-Ab1-TTR molecule was constructed by fusing the C terminus of the human anti-TRAILR2 antibody (Ab1) heavy chain directly to the N terminus of human TTR without linkers. Because there are two copies of the heavy chain in the full Ab1, this results in the formation of a TTR dimer at the C terminus of the Ab1, which subsequently forms a noncovalent TTR tetramer resulting in tail-to-tail dimerization of the Ab1, leaving the antigen-binding domains unobstructed (Fig. 1). The 4X-Ab1-TTR molecule was assembled in a similar manner; however, charge pair mutations in the CH3 domain that discourage heavy chain homodimerization and thus favor heterodimerization of the CH3 domain (54Florio M. Gunasekaran K. Stolina M. Li X. Liu L. Tipton B. Salimi-Moosavi H. Asuncion F.J. Li C. Sun B. Tan H.L. Zhang L. Han C.Y. Case R. Duguay A.N. et al.A bispecific antibody targeting sclerostin and DKK-1 promotes bone mass accrual and fracture repair.Nat. Commun. 2016; 7 (27230681): 1150510.1038/ncomms11505Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) enabled fusion of only one TTR monomer per full Ab1. This results in formation of an Ab1 tetramer complex (Fig. 1). The 4X-Fab1-TTR molecule was produced by fusing the C terminus of the Fab1 heavy chain to the N terminus of the TTR with the addition of two intervening glycines to form a linker (Fig. 1). To aid in purification of the fusion of Fab1, which lacks an Fc, a polyhistidine tag was added to the C terminus of the TTR. The constructs were stably expressed in CHO-K1 cells at 2–10-liter scale, and the resultant molecules were purified by affinity capture chromatography followed by cation-exchange chromatography yielding 72 mg/liter (4X-Fab1-TTR), 41 mg/liter (2X-Ab1-TTR), and 26 mg/liter (4X-Ab1-TTR) product determined to be 96.2, 94.9, and 83.1% pure, respectively, as determined by analytical size-exclusion chromatography (SEC). The oligomerization state of the fusion proteins was determined by analytical SEC. Each molecule showed a shift to shorter SEC peak retention time as would be expected for the increasing size of the molecules (Ab1, 148 kDa; 4X-Fab1-TTR, 248 kDa; 2X-Ab1-TTR, 345 kDa; and 4X-Ab1-TTR, 635 kDa), indicating that the molecules were primarily assembled as expected (Fig. 2A and Fig. S1). The prepeaks may be dimers of the assemblies. Mass spectral analysis further confirmed the TTR fusion assemblies by detecting intact molecular masses of 248,423, 345,622, and 635,962 Da for the 4X-Fab1-TTR, 2X-Ab1-TTR, and 4X-Ab1-TTR, respectively. The propensity of the fusion assemblies to exchange with unfused TTR was determined by incubating the fusion molecules with 24-fold molar excess unfused tetramer at 37 °C for 28 days. After the 28-day incubation period, the SEC profiles of the fusion molecules (between 4 and 5.5 min) and the unfused TTR tetramers (between 6.5 and 7.0 min) did not significantly change (Fig. 2B). If TTR subunit exchange was occurring, an intermediate size species eluting between the fusion molecules and the unfused molecules would be expected. The cytotoxic activity of the TTR fusion constructs was evaluated in vitro against the colorectal cancer cell lines Colo205-Luc and SW403. In these cell lines, the parental antibody, Ab1, demonstrates little to no cell killing. Cross-linking of the antibody with protein G enables cell killing in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 3, Figure 4), consistent with the requirement of antibody clustering for activity (36Sjöbring U. Björck L. Kastern W. Streptococcal protein G.J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266 (1985908): 399-405Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, the cytotoxic activity of the three TTR fusion constructs was more potent than that induced by the cross-linked Ab1 (Figure 3, Figure 4). The most potent activity was observed with the 4X-Ab1-TTR construct. Similar results were observed in both cell lines.Figure 4The activity of the TTR fusion proteins versus Ab1 on the human carcinoma cell line Colo205-Luc. Colo205-Luc cells were incubated with Ab1 in the absence or presence of 1 μg/ml protein G to promote cross-linking as well as with the TTR fusion proteins alone (n = 3). After 24 h of incubation, cell viability was assessed using a CellTiter-Glo assay and analyzed as a percentage of cell viability relative to untreated cells. The effective concentration for 50% activity (± S.E.) were 225.8 ± 83.1 ng/ml for Ab1 + ProG, 6.4 ± 1.9 ng/ml for 2X-Ab-TTR, 6.3 ± 0.7 ng/ml for 4X-Fab-TTR, and 0.7 ± 0.1 ng/ml for 4X-Ab-TTR.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The pharmacokinetic (PK) profiles of the antibodies and TTR fusion molecules were assessed in mice after IV administration. The benchmark antibodies conatumumab (Ab1) and a variant of conatumumab harboring two complementarity-determining regions mutations that render the molecule unable to bind TRAILR2 (Ab2) both demonstrated a PK profile typical for an antibody. Because both the target-binding Ab1 and non–target-binding Ab2 have nearly identical PK properties (AUC0-t of 38,482 and 39,483 nm/h respectively), target-mediated clearance is unlikely a factor in the PK of these molecules (Fig. 5 and Table 1). The 2X-Ab1-TTR fusion displayed slightly more favorable coverage (AUC0-t of 57,167 nm/h) than either benchmark antibody. The 4X-Ab1-TTR fusion showed initial PK properties similar to those of the benchmark antibodies and the 2X-Ab1-TTR fusion, but after 336 h the PK appears to be slightly less favorable than the benchmark antibodies (AUC0-t of 26,457 nm/h). As expected, the 4X-Fab1-TTR fusion, lacking an Fc for neonatal Fc receptor-mediated recycling, showed substantially inferior PK properties compared with any other molecules in the study (AUC0-t of 3,025 nm/h). Together, these data support the idea that the 2X-Ab1-TTR and 4X-Ab-1-TTR have PK properties similar to that of Ab1 with the potential for increased efficacy.Table 1PK of the TTR fusion molecules and antibody benchmarks. PK of the TTR fusion molecules and antibody benchmarks was assessed in male CD-1 mice after intravenous administration at molar equivalent levels based on a 6.5-mg/kg dose of 4X-Ab1-TTR. Ab1 is the benchmark conatumumab antibody, and Ab2 is a variant of conatumumab with two complementary determinant region mutations that render the molecule unable to bind TRAILR2. To measure the serum concentration, an anti-idiotypic antibody was used to capture the molecules, and an anti-human Fc antibody was used for detection in an MSD-based assay.CompoundIV doseMolecular massT1/2CmaxCLAUC0-tAUC0-Infmg/kgkDaHnmml/h/kgnm/hnm/hAb11.51485071790.17938,48255,939Ab21.51486421830.15339,48365,4042X-Ab1-TTR3.53458472000.16657,167113,2544X-Fab1-TTR2.5248131954.6383,0253,0434X-Ab1-TTR6.56352432110.13726,45728,837 Open table in a new tab The antitumor activity of the TTR fusion molecules was evaluated in colorectal cancer xenograft models in vivo. SW403 cells were implanted subcutaneously into immunocompromised mice, and the tumors were allowed to reach 58–66 mm3. The mice were then treated with TTR fusion constructs, antibody, or vehicle only, twice a week for 3 weeks. As expected, treatment of mice with the control antibody Ab2 did not impact tumor growth (Fig. 6). Treatment with either Ab1 or the 2X-Ab1-TTR construct modestly inhibited tumor growth, but this effect was not statistically significant (Fig. 6). In contrast, both the 4X-Fab1-TTR and 4X-Ab1-TTR fusions were very effective in inhibiting tumor growth in this model, with tumor stasis observed after only two doses (p < 0.05). The body weight of the animals was unaffected by treatment, consistent with the lack of cross-activity of Ab1 or the TTR fusion constructs for mouse TRAILR2 (Fig. 6). The TTR fusion molecules were also evaluated in the Colo205-Luc xenograft model. Immunocompromised mice were implanted subcutaneously with Colo205-Luc cells, and the tumors were allowed to grow to 40–48 mm3. The mice were then randomized and treated with TTR fusion molecules, Ab1, control antibody, or vehicle only. As in the SW403 model, the non–target-binding Ab2 did not affect Colo205-Luc tumor growth (Fig. 7). Unexpectedly, the 2X-Ab1-TTR fusion construct also did not have antitumor activity in the Colo205-Luc model (Fig. 7). In contrast, Ab1 significantly inhibited tumor growth, with similar efficacy as the 4X-Fab1-TTR and 4X-Ab1-TTR constructs (Fig. 7). Both Ab1 and the 4X-Fab1-TTR construct were able to induce tumor stasis in the Colo205-Luc model after just two treatments. The 4X-Ab1-TTR construct promotes tumor regression after two treatments, suggesting that this construct is most effective in promoting antibody clustering and tumor cell killing. For some therapeutic applications, the ability of an antibody to cluster the target can be advantageous (27Szymanska M. Fosdahl A.M. Nikolaysen F. Pedersen M.W. Grandal M.M. Stang E. Bertelsen V.

https://openalex.org/W3033454899,"To examine interocular asymmetry of foveal avascular zone (FAZ) and parafoveal capillary density metrics in sickle cell retinopathy (SCR) using optical coherence tomography angiography (OCT-A).This cross-sectional, retrospective study evaluated SCR patients and unaffected controls who underwent 3x3mm macular OCT-A imaging using a spectral domain-OCT system. FAZ (area, perimeter, and acircularity index) and parafoveal capillary density metrics were computed for both eyes of each participant. In unaffected controls, interocular difference in FAZ and parafoveal capillary density metrics were evaluated using Bland-Altman plots. SCR patients with interocular difference outside the upper 97.5% and lower 2.5% limits of agreement from controls were defined as having interocular asymmetry. Area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AROC) was also performed to determine the ability of the absolute interocular difference to differentiate between subjects with SCR-including non-proliferative SCR (NP-SCR) and proliferative SCR (P-SCR)-and unaffected controls.Thirty-one patients with SCR (21 NP-SCR and 10 P-SCR) and 14 race-matched and age-matched controls were included for analysis. Interocular asymmetry was seen for all FAZ and parafoveal capillary density metrics in NP-SCR and P-SCR subjects. SCR subjects showed greater disease severity in the left-eye for FAZ and parafoveal capillary density metrics.NP-SCR and P-SCR patients demonstrated quantifiable interocular asymmetry in FAZ and parafoveal capillary density metrics compared to unaffected subjects, with left-eye predominance in disease severity."
https://openalex.org/W3034054011,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are important regulators of gene expression, and their expression is associated with many physiological conditions. Here, we investigated potential associations between expression levels of miRNAs in human placenta and the onset of spontaneous term birth. Using RNA sequencing, we identified 54 miRNAs differentially expressed during spontaneous term labor compared to elective term births. Expression levels of 23 miRNAs were upregulated, whereas 31 were downregulated at least 1.5-fold. The upregulated miRNA miR-371a-5p putatively targets CPPED1, expression of which decreases during spontaneous birth. We used a luciferase reporter-based assay to test whether a miR-371a-5p mimic affected translation when it bound to the 3' untranslated region of CPPED1. In this setting, the miR-371a-5p mimic resulted in lower luciferase activity, which suggests that miR-371a-5p regulates levels of CPPED1. In conclusion, inversely correlated levels of miR-371a-5p and CPPED1 suggest a role for both in spontaneous delivery."
https://openalex.org/W3033366035,"The aim of this study is to investigate the influencing factors associated with no/low response to preoperative concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) for locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC) patients. A total of 79 patients were included in this prospective study. Fifteen factors that might affect the resistance to CCRT were included in this logistic regression analysis, these factors include the general clinical data of patients, the expression status of tumor stem cell marker CD44v6 and the volumetric imaging parameters of primary tumor lesions. We found that the no/low response status to preoperative CCRT was positively correlated with the real tumor volume (RTV), the total surface area of tumor (TSA), and CD44v6 expression, whereas negatively correlated with the tumor compactness (TC). According to the results of logistic regression analysis, two formulas that could predict whether or not no/low response to preoperative CCRT were established. The Area Under Curve (AUC) of the two formulas and those significant measurement data (RTV, TC, TSA) were 0.900, 0.858, 0.771, 0.754, 0.859, the sensitivity were 95.8%, 79.17%, 62.50%, 95.83%, 62.5%, the specificity were 70.9%, 74.55%, 83.64%,47.27%, 96.36%, the positive predictive values were 58.96%, 57.58%, 62.51%,44.23%, 88.23%, the negative predictive values were 97.48%, 89.13%, 83.64%, 96.29%, and 85.48%, respectively."
