https://openalex.org/W2606848380,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a rapidly progressing neurodegenerative disease that is characterized by motor neuron loss and that leads to paralysis and death 2-5 years after disease onset. Nearly all patients with ALS have aggregates of the RNA-binding protein TDP-43 in their brains and spinal cords, and rare mutations in the gene encoding TDP-43 can cause ALS. There are no effective TDP-43-directed therapies for ALS or related TDP-43 proteinopathies, such as frontotemporal dementia. Antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) and RNA-interference approaches are emerging as attractive therapeutic strategies in neurological diseases. Indeed, treatment of a rat model of inherited ALS (caused by a mutation in Sod1) with ASOs against Sod1 has been shown to substantially slow disease progression. However, as SOD1 mutations account for only around 2-5% of ALS cases, additional therapeutic strategies are needed. Silencing TDP-43 itself is probably not appropriate, given its critical cellular functions. Here we present a promising alternative therapeutic strategy for ALS that involves targeting ataxin-2. A decrease in ataxin-2 suppresses TDP-43 toxicity in yeast and flies, and intermediate-length polyglutamine expansions in the ataxin-2 gene increase risk of ALS. We used two independent approaches to test whether decreasing ataxin-2 levels could mitigate disease in a mouse model of TDP-43 proteinopathy. First, we crossed ataxin-2 knockout mice with TDP-43 (also known as TARDBP) transgenic mice. The decrease in ataxin-2 reduced aggregation of TDP-43, markedly increased survival and improved motor function. Second, in a more therapeutically applicable approach, we administered ASOs targeting ataxin-2 to the central nervous system of TDP-43 transgenic mice. This single treatment markedly extended survival. Because TDP-43 aggregation is a component of nearly all cases of ALS, targeting ataxin-2 could represent a broadly effective therapeutic strategy."

Here we reconstruct the dispersal, proliferation and decline of Ebola virus throughout the region by analysing 1,610 Ebola virus genomes, which represent over 5% of the known cases. We test the association of geography, climate and demography with viral movement among administrative regions, inferring a classic 'gravity' model, with intense dispersal between larger and closer populations. Despite attenuation of international dispersal after border closures, cross-border transmission had already sown the seeds for an international epidemic, rendering these measures ineffective at curbing the epidemic. We address why the epidemic did not spread into neighbouring countries, showing that these countries were susceptible to substantial outbreaks but at lower risk of introductions. Finally, we reveal that this large epidemic was a heterogeneous and spatially dissociated collection of transmission clusters of varying size, duration and connectivity. These insights will help to inform interventions in future epidemics."

https://openalex.org/W2605659507,"A major goal of biomedicine is to understand the function of every gene in the human genome. Loss-of-function mutations can disrupt both copies of a given gene in humans and phenotypic analysis of such 'human knockouts' can provide insight into gene function. Consanguineous unions are more likely to result in offspring carrying homozygous loss-of-function mutations. In Pakistan, consanguinity rates are notably high. Here we sequence the protein-coding regions of 10,503 adult participants in the Pakistan Risk of Myocardial Infarction Study (PROMIS), designed to understand the determinants of cardiometabolic diseases in individuals from South Asia. We identified individuals carrying homozygous predicted loss-of-function (pLoF) mutations, and performed phenotypic analysis involving more than 200 biochemical and disease traits. We enumerated 49,138 rare (<1% minor allele frequency) pLoF mutations. These pLoF mutations are estimated to knock out 1,317 genes, each in at least one participant. Homozygosity for pLoF mutations at PLA2G7 was associated with absent enzymatic activity of soluble lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2; at CYP2F1, with higher plasma interleukin-8 concentrations; at TREH, with lower concentrations of apoB-containing lipoprotein subfractions; at either A3GALT2 or NRG4, with markedly reduced plasma insulin C-peptide concentrations; and at SLC9A3R1, with mediators of calcium and phosphate signalling. Heterozygous deficiency of APOC3 has been shown to protect against coronary heart disease; we identified APOC3 homozygous pLoF carriers in our cohort. We recruited these human knockouts and challenged them with an oral fat load. Compared with family members lacking the mutation, individuals with APOC3 knocked out displayed marked blunting of the usual post-prandial rise in plasma triglycerides. Overall, these observations provide a roadmap for a 'human knockout project', a systematic effort to understand the phenotypic consequences of complete disruption of genes in humans."
https://openalex.org/W2606911774,"There are no disease-modifying treatments for adult human neurodegenerative diseases. Here we test RNA-targeted therapies in two mouse models of spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (SCA2), an autosomal dominant polyglutamine disease. Both models recreate the progressive adult-onset dysfunction and degeneration of a neuronal network that are seen in patients, including decreased firing frequency of cerebellar Purkinje cells and a decline in motor function. We developed a potential therapy directed at the ATXN2 gene by screening 152 antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs). The most promising oligonucleotide, ASO7, downregulated ATXN2 mRNA and protein, which resulted in delayed onset of the SCA2 phenotype. After delivery by intracerebroventricular injection to ATXN2-Q127 mice, ASO7 localized to Purkinje cells, reduced cerebellar ATXN2 expression below 75% for more than 10 weeks without microglial activation, and reduced the levels of cerebellar ATXN2. Treatment of symptomatic mice with ASO7 improved motor function compared to saline-treated mice. ASO7 had a similar effect in the BAC-Q72 SCA2 mouse model, and in both mouse models it normalized protein levels of several SCA2-related proteins expressed in Purkinje cells, including Rgs8, Pcp2, Pcp4, Homer3, Cep76 and Fam107b. Notably, the firing frequency of Purkinje cells returned to normal even when treatment was initiated more than 12 weeks after the onset of the motor phenotype in BAC-Q72 mice. These findings support ASOs as a promising approach for treating some human neurodegenerative diseases."

https://openalex.org/W2606337068,"The archosaur species Teleocrater rhadinus, part of the new clade Aphanosauria, is an example of the earliest divergence of the avian stem lineage (Avemetatarsalia), the lineage that contains dinosaurs (including birds). The early history of the bird-line archosaurs, a group including dinosaurs, birds and pterosaurs, but excluding crocodilians, is not well defined. This is due in part to a fragmentary fossil record, but the distinctive morphology of pterosaurs has also obscured their ancestry. Sterling Nesbitt and colleagues describe a new species, Teleocraterrhadinus, from the Middle Triassic of Tanzania, that represents the most primitive known member of the bird-line archosaurs. Teleocrater provides the best guide so far to the ancestral bird-line condition. It was a lightly built, quadrupedal carnivore, so more like a crocodile than the small bipeds often depicted at this point in archosaur evolution. These are long-awaited findings on Teleocrater, which was undergoing study by the late Alan Charig of the Natural History Museum in London, and remained unpublished on his death in 1997. The relationship between dinosaurs and other reptiles is well established1,2,3,4, but the sequence of acquisition of dinosaurian features has been obscured by the scarcity of fossils with transitional morphologies. The closest extinct relatives of dinosaurs either have highly derived morphologies5,6,7 or are known from poorly preserved8,9 or incomplete material10,11. Here we describe one of the stratigraphically lowest and phylogenetically earliest members of the avian stem lineage (Avemetatarsalia), Teleocrater rhadinus gen. et sp. nov., from the Middle Triassic epoch. The anatomy of T. rhadinus provides key information that unites several enigmatic taxa from across Pangaea into a previously unrecognized clade, Aphanosauria. This clade is the sister taxon of Ornithodira (pterosaurs and birds) and shortens the ghost lineage inferred at the base of Avemetatarsalia. We demonstrate that several anatomical features long thought to characterize Dinosauria and dinosauriforms evolved much earlier, soon after the bird–crocodylian split, and that the earliest avemetatarsalians retained the crocodylian-like ankle morphology and hindlimb proportions of stem archosaurs and early pseudosuchians. Early avemetatarsalians were substantially more species-rich, widely geographically distributed and morphologically diverse than previously recognized. Moreover, several early dinosauromorphs that were previously used as models to understand dinosaur origins may represent specialized forms rather than the ancestral avemetatarsalian morphology."
https://openalex.org/W2607341326,"The Rad51 (also known as RecA) family of recombinases executes the critical step in homologous recombination: the search for homologous DNA to serve as a template during the repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). Although budding yeast Rad51 has been extensively characterized in vitro, the stringency of its search and sensitivity to mismatched sequences in vivo remain poorly defined. Here, in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we analysed Rad51-dependent break-induced replication in which the invading DSB end and its donor template share a 108-base-pair homology region and the donor carries different densities of single-base-pair mismatches. With every eighth base pair mismatched, repair was about 14% of that of completely homologous sequences. With every sixth base pair mismatched, repair was still more than 5%. Thus, completing break-induced replication in vivo overcomes the apparent requirement for at least 6-8 consecutive paired bases that has been inferred from in vitro studies. When recombination occurs without a protruding nonhomologous 3' tail, the mismatch repair protein Msh2 does not discourage homeologous recombination. However, when the DSB end contains a 3' protruding nonhomologous tail, Msh2 promotes the rejection of mismatched substrates. Mismatch correction of strand invasion heteroduplex DNA is strongly polar, favouring correction close to the DSB end. Nearly all mismatch correction depends on the proofreading activity of DNA polymerase-δ, although the repair proteins Msh2, Mlh1 and Exo1 influence the extent of correction."

https://openalex.org/W2606891455,"Comorbid medical diseases are highly prevalent in the geriatric population, imposing hardship on healthcare services for demented individuals. Dementia also complicates clinical care for other co-existing medical conditions. This study investigated the comorbidities associated with dementia in the elderly population aged 65 years and over in Taiwan.We conducted a nationwide, population-based, cross-sectional survey; participants were selected by computerized random sampling from all 19 Taiwan counties between December 2011 and March 2013. After exclusion of incomplete or erroneous data, 8,456 subjects were enrolled. Of them, 6,183 were cognitively normal (control group), 1,576 had mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and 697 had dementia. We collected information about types of comorbidities (i.e., vascular risk factors, lung diseases, liver diseases, gastrointestinal diseases, and cancers), Charlson comorbidity index score, and demographic variables to compare subjects with normal cognition, MCI, and dementia.Regardless of the cognitive condition, over 60% of the individuals in each group had at least one comorbid disease. The proportion of subjects possessing at least three comorbidities was higher in those with cognitive impairment (MCI 20.9%, dementia 27.3%) than in control group (15%). Hypertension and diabetes mellitus were the most common comorbidities. The mean number of comorbidities and Charlson comorbidity index score were greater in MCI and dementia groups than in control group. Logistic regression demonstrated that the comorbidities significantly associated with MCI and dementia were cerebrovascular disease (OR 3.35, CI 2.62-4.28), cirrhosis (OR 3.29, CI 1.29-8.41), asthma (OR 1.56, CI 1.07-2.27), and diabetes mellitus (OR 1.24, CI 1.07-1.44).Multiple medical comorbid diseases are common in older adults, especially in those with cognitive impairment. Cerebrovascular disease, cirrhosis, asthma, and diabetes mellitus are important contributors to cognitive deterioration in the elderly. Efforts to lower cumulative medical burden in the geriatric population may benefit cognitive function."

The present study investigated the use of an EPA+DHA oil derived from transgenic Camelina sativa in Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) feeds containing low levels of fishmeal (35%) and fish oil (10%), reflecting current commercial formulations, to determine the impacts on tissue fatty acid profile, intestinal transcriptome, and health of farmed salmon. Post-smolt Atlantic salmon were fed for 12-weeks with one of three experimental diets containing either a blend of fish oil/rapeseed oil (FO), wild-type camelina oil (WCO) or transgenic camelina oil (DCO) as added lipid source. The DCO diet did not affect any of the fish performance or health parameters studied. Analyses of the mid and hindgut transcriptomes showed only mild effects on metabolism. Flesh of fish fed the DCO diet accumulated almost double the amount of n-3 LC-PUFA than fish fed the FO or WCO diets, indicating that these oils from transgenic oilseeds offer the opportunity to increase the n-3 LC-PUFA in farmed fish to levels comparable to those found a decade ago."
https://openalex.org/W2606430072,"Obesity causes excess fat accumulation in white adipose tissues (WAT) and also in other insulin-responsive organs such as the skeletal muscle, increasing the risk for insulin resistance, which can lead to obesity-related metabolic disorders. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-α (PPARα) is a master regulator of fatty acid oxidation whose activator is known to improve hyperlipidemia. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying PPARα activator-mediated reduction in adiposity and improvement of metabolic disorders are largely unknown. In this study we investigated the effects of PPARα agonist (fenofibrate) on glucose metabolism dysfunction in obese mice. Fenofibrate treatment reduced adiposity and attenuated obesity-induced dysfunctions of glucose metabolism in obese mice fed a high-fat diet. However, fenofibrate treatment did not improve glucose metabolism in lipodystrophic A-Zip/F1 mice, suggesting that adipose tissue is important for the fenofibrate-mediated amelioration of glucose metabolism, although skeletal muscle actions could not be completely excluded. Moreover, we investigated the role of the hepatokine fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21), which regulates energy metabolism in adipose tissue. In WAT of WT mice, but not of FGF21-deficient mice, fenofibrate enhanced the expression of genes related to brown adipocyte functions, such as Ucp1, Pgc1a, and Cpt1b. Fenofibrate increased energy expenditure and attenuated obesity, whole body insulin resistance, and adipocyte dysfunctions in WAT in high-fat-diet-fed WT mice but not in FGF21-deficient mice.

https://openalex.org/W2606278622,"The endocannabinoid system has previously been shown to play a role in the permeability and inflammatory response of the human gut. The goal of our study was to determine the effects of endogenous anandamide (AEA) and 2-arachidonoyl glycerol (2-AG) on the permeability and inflammatory response of intestinal epithelium under normal, inflammatory, and hypoxic conditions. Human intestinal mucosa was modeled using Caco-2 cells. Human tissue was collected from planned colorectal resections. Accumulation of AEA and 2-AG was achieved by inhibiting their metabolizing enzymes URB597 (a fatty acid amide hydrolase inhibitor) and JZL184 (a monoacylglycerol lipase inhibitor). Inflammation and ischemia were simulated with TNF-α and IFN-γ and oxygen deprivation. Permeability changes were measured by transepithelial electrical resistance. The role of the CB1 receptor was explored using CB1-knockdown (CB1Kd) intestinal epithelial cells. Endocannabinoid levels were measured using liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry. Cytokine secretion was measured using multiplex and ELISA. URB597 and JZL184 caused a concentration-dependent increase in permeability via CB1 (P < 0.0001) and decreased cytokine production. Basolateral application of JZL184 decreased permeability via CB1 (P < 0.0001). URB597 and JZL184 increased the enhanced (worsened) permeability caused by inflammation and hypoxia (P < 0.0001 and P < 0.05). CB1Kd cells showed reduced permeability response to inflammation (P < 0.01) but not hypoxia. 2-AG levels were increased in response to inflammation and hypoxia in Caco-2 cells. In human mucosal tissue, inflammation increased the secretion of granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor, IL-12, −13, and −15, which was prevented with ex vivo treatment with URB597 and JZL184, and was inhibited by a CB1 antagonist. The results of this study show that endogenous AEA and 2-AG production and CB1 activation play a key modulatory roles in normal intestinal mucosa permeability and in inflammatory and hypoxic conditions.—Karwad, M.

https://openalex.org/W2950723482,"The ability to control electronic states at the nanoscale has contributed to our modern understanding of condensed matter. In particular, quantum dot circuits represent model systems for the study of strong electronic correlations, epitomized by the Kondo effect. Here, we show that circuit Quantum Electrodynamics architectures can be used to study the internal degrees of freedom of such a many-body phenomenon. We couple a quantum dot to a high finesse microwave cavity to measure with an unprecedented sensitivity the dot electronic compressibility i.e. the ability of the dot to accommodate charges. Because it corresponds solely to the charge response of the electronic system, this quantity is not equivalent to the conductance which involves in general other degrees of freedom such as spin. By performing dual conductance/compressibility measurements in the Kondo regime, we uncover directly the charge dynamics of this peculiar mechanism of electron transfer. Strikingly, the Kondo resonance, visible in transport measurements, is transparent to microwave photons trapped in the high finesse cavity. This reveals that, in such a many body resonance, finite conduction is achieved from a charge frozen by Coulomb interaction. This previously elusive freezing of charge dynamics is in stark contrast with the physics of a free electron gas. Our setup highlights the power of circuit quantum electrodynamics architectures to study condensed matter problems. The tools of cavity quantum electrodynamics could be used in other types of mesoscopic circuits with many-body correlations and bring a promising platform to perform quantum simulation of fermion-boson problems."
https://openalex.org/W2606977046,"A single bout of low-frequency electroacupuncture (EA) causing muscle contractions increases whole-body glucose uptake in insulin-resistant rats. We explored the underlying mechanism of this finding and whether it can be translated into clinical settings. Changes in glucose infusion rate (GIR) were measured by euglycemic–hyperinsulinemic clamp during and after 45 min of low-frequency EA in 21 overweight/obese women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and 21 controls matched for age, weight, and body mass index (experiment 1) and in rats receiving autonomic receptor blockers (experiment 2). GIR was higher after EA in controls and women with PCOS. Plasma serotonin levels and homovanillic acid, markers of vagal activity, decreased in both controls and patients with PCOS. Adipose tissue expression of pro-nerve growth factor (proNGF) decreased, and the mature NGF/proNGF ratio increased after EA in PCOS, but not in controls, suggesting increased sympathetic-driven adipose tissue metabolism. Administration of a-/β-adrenergic receptor blockers in rats blocked the increase in GIR in response to EA. Muscarinic and dopamine receptor antagonist also blocked the response but with slower onset. In conclusion, a single bout of EA increases whole-body glucose uptake by activation of the sympathetic and partly the parasympathetic nervous systems, which could have important clinical implications for the treatment of insulin resistance.—Benrick, A., Kokosar, M., Hu, M., Larsson, M., Maliqueo, M., Marcondes, R.

https://openalex.org/W2605807310,"Harmony Search (HS) and Teaching-Learning-Based Optimization (TLBO) as new swarm intelligent optimization algorithms have received much attention in recent years. Both of them have shown outstanding performance for solving NP-Hard optimization problems. However, they also suffer dramatic performance degradation for some complex high-dimensional optimization problems. Through a lot of experiments, we find that the HS and TLBO have strong complementarity each other. The HS has strong global exploration power but low convergence speed. Reversely, the TLBO has much fast convergence speed but it is easily trapped into local search. In this work, we propose a hybrid search algorithm named HSTLBO that merges the two algorithms together for synergistically solving complex optimization problems using a self-adaptive selection strategy. In the HSTLBO, both HS and TLBO are modified with the aim of balancing the global exploration and exploitation abilities, where the HS aims mainly to explore the unknown regions and the TLBO aims to rapidly exploit high-precision solutions in the known regions. Our experimental results demonstrate better performance and faster speed than five state-of-the-art HS variants and show better exploration power than five good TLBO variants with similar run time, which illustrates that our method is promising in solving complex high-dimensional optimization problems. The experiment on portfolio optimization problems also demonstrate that the HSTLBO is effective in solving complex read-world application."

However, the role of hypovitaminosis D in the pathogenesis of early TB infection acquisition is unclear. We aimed to evaluate the association of VD deficiency, season of the year, and latent TB infection in household contacts (HHC), given that this is a potentially modifiable condition often related to nutritional deficiencies and lack of sun exposure.We prospectively enrolled new pulmonary TB cases (n = 107) and their HHC (n = 144) over a 2-year period in Santiago, Chile. We compared plasma 25-hydroxycholecalciferol (25OHD) levels and examined the influence of season, ethnic background, living conditions, and country of origin.Over 77% of TB cases and 62.6% of HHC had VD deficiency (<20 ng/ml). Median 25OHD concentration was significantly lower in TB cases than in HHC (11.7 vs. 18.2 ng/ml, p<0.0001). Migrants HHC had lower 25OHD levels than non-migrants (14.6 vs. 19.0 ng/ml, p = 0.026), and a trend towards a higher burden of latent TB infection (52.9% vs. 35.2%, p = 0.066). Multivariate analysis found VD deficiency in HHC was strongly associated with being sampled in winter/spring (adOR 25.68, 95%CI 7.35-89.7), corresponding to the seasons with lowest solar radiation exposure. Spring enrollment-compared with other seasons-was the chief risk factor for latent TB infection in HHC (adOR 3.14, 95%CI 1.28-7.69).Hypovitaminosis D was highly prevalent in TB cases and also in HHC. A marked seasonality was found for both VD levels and latent TB in HHC, with winter being the season with lowest VD levels and spring the season with the highest risk of latent TB infection."

Thus, there is a fine balance of NOD2 and RIPK2 signaling that must be achieved to coordinate a balanced immune response. Too much signaling causes inflammatory disease, and too little signaling also causes inflammatory disease. Given the role of posttranslational modifications, especially ubiquitination, in regulating NOD2 signaling activity (reviewed in Ref. 14Tigno-Aranjuez J.T. Abbott D.W.

XIAP mutations linked to XLP-2 and VEO-IBD are dispersed throughout the gene and cause either truncation of the protein or amino acid substitutions. Numerous independent groups have shown that truncation mutants that delete the RING domain and point mutants that disrupt the BIR2 domain greatly decrease NOD:RIPK2 signaling.

For this reason, reconstitution experiments with XLP-2 or VEO-IBD mutations have not been performed. Cell death in XLP-2 and VEO-IBD patient primary cells and in XLP-2 and VEO-IBD patient tissue has been studied, but these studies have been limited to CD3+ T cells and intestinal epithelial cells and have been inconsistent.

In only one of these studies was a particular patient mutation correlated with apoptosis, and it is therefore difficult to determine from the literature which XIAP mutations cause apoptosis susceptibility. XIAP mutant intestinal epithelial cell apoptosis studies have likewise been inconsistent. One study using immunohistochemical techniques showed no increased apoptosis, whereas a reconstitution study in an immortalized XIAP-deficient colon carcinoma cell line (XIAP−/Y HCT-116) showed that XIAP mutations actually confer a degree of protection against TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL)-induced apoptosis compared with genetic loss of XIAP (39Aguilar C.

The discordance in susceptibility to cell death between patient samples and across cell types is potentially the result of genetic heterogeneity among patients, differing treatment regimens among patients, differing patient disease courses, and different techniques and agonists used in each study. Although these human studies are incredibly important to understand human pathophysiology, caveats present in all human studies make identification of molecular mechanisms more difficult. XIAP-null BMDMs have a very strong cell death phenotype (42Yabal M. Müller N. Adler H. Knies N. Groß C.J. Damgaard R.B. Kanegane H. Ringelhan M. Kaufmann T. Heikenwälder M. Strasser A. Groß O.

Transplant. 2015; 19: E25-E28Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), systematic study of XIAP mutants in the myeloid lineage is important for the field but has yet to be performed. In this work, we generate XIAP knockout macrophages and dendritic cells. We show that these cells recapitulate the published NOD2 signaling defect and allow systematic study of the role of XIAP in inflammatory cell death in the myeloid lineage. We show that XIAP-null macrophages preferentially undergo apoptosis in response to inflammatory stimuli, whereas XIAP-null dendritic cells undergo both apoptosis and necroptosis. We reconstitute these cells with the three major XIAP truncation mutants as well as point mutations from each of the BIR domains at near endogenous levels. We employ these reconstituted cells to show that mutants that cause NOD2 signaling loss also cause inflammatory cell death susceptibility, whereas those that do not affect NOD2 signaling also do not affect inflammatory cell death susceptibility. Last, we identify and utilize three novel XLP-2-linked XIAP mutations to predict and study mutant function. In all, this work supports the published role of XIAP in NOD2:RIPK2 signaling. This system allows the rapid interrogation of newly discovered XIAP variants for functional deficits. Further, these findings resolve important inconsistencies concerning the role XIAP mutations play in inflammatory cell death susceptibility and provide a platform to study the molecular biology of novel XIAP mutants. The investigation of XIAP loss in innate immune signaling pathways has been somewhat limited by the reagents available. Two immortalized cell lines in which XIAP is genetically lost, XIAP−/− MEFs and XIAP−/Y HCT116 cells, have less-than-robust responses to toll-like receptor (TLR) and NOD stimuli compared with macrophages and dendritic cells. Mutant reconstitution in primary cells from XIAP−/− mice and subsequent study of those cells is difficult because of the limited proliferative capacity of primary cells, and the study of XIAP-mutated patient cells is limited by both the availability of primary patient cells and the limited amount of blood that can be drawn from these young patients. Given these difficulties and the need to reconcile variable reports of inflammatory cell death phenotypes in XIAP-mutant cells, we coupled CRISPR/Cas9 with our recently published myeloid lentiviral expression system (50Chirieleison S.M.

However, the pathogenesis of AD-related cognitive impairments induced by isoflurane anesthesia remains elusive. Thus, this study was designed to investigate the mechanism by which isoflurane anesthesia caused AD-related cognitive impairments. Aged Wistar rats were randomly divided into 6 groups (n = 12), 1 control group (CONT) and 5 isoflurane treated (ISO) groups (ISO 0, ISO 0.5D, ISO 1D, ISO 3D and ISO 7D). The CONT group inhaled 30% O2 for 2 h without any anesthesia. ISO groups were placed under anesthesia with 3% isoflurane and then exposed to 1.5% isoflurane delivered in 30% O2 for 2 h. Rats in each ISO group were then analyzed immediately (ISO 0) or at various time points (0.5, 1, 3 or 7 day) after this exposure. Cognitive function was assessed using the Morris water maze test. Protein levels of amyloid precursor protein (APP), β-site APP cleavage enzyme-1 (BACE-1) and Aβ42 peptide were analyzed in hippocampal samples by Western blot. β-Amyloid (Abeta) plaques were detected in hippocampal sections by Congo red staining. Compared with controls, all ISO groups showed increased escape latency and impaired spatial memory. Isoflurane increased APP mRNA expression and APP protein depletion, promoting Aβ42 overproduction, oligomerization and accumulation. However, isoflurane did not affect BACE-1 expression. Abeta plaques were observed only in those ISO groups sacrificed at 3 or 7 d. Our data indicate that aged rats exposed to isoflurane had increased APP mRNA expression and APP protein depletion, with Aβ42 peptide overproduction and oligomerization, resulting in formation of Abeta plaques in the hippocampus. Such effects might have contributed to cognitive impairments, including in spatial memory, observed in these rats after isoflurane anesthesia."

However, few studies have examined the density of Wolbachia in hosts in the field. Here, we focus on Wolbachia infection of the pale grass blue butterfly, Zizeeria maha (Lepidoptera: Lycaenidae), which is distributed throughout the Japanese islands. We examined the rate and density of Wolbachia infection in the bodies of butterflies at thirteen locations in Japan. At seven of these places, we collected butterflies in different seasons to determine seasonal differences in the infection rate and density and found that Wolbachia density has seasonal differences within the same population. Moreover, to determine whether Wolbachia density has a geographical cline, we compared the infection density of Wolbachia amongst all geographical populations. In addition, we determined the sequences of Wolbachia wsp and host mtDNA CO1 haplotypes of all populations. The results showed that Wolbachia density increased in early summer and decreased in autumn. Further, the density of Wolbachia infecting the same strain of Z. maha varied amongst populations, although no tendency in geographical cline was observed."
https://openalex.org/W2607439114,"Most wildlife species are urban avoiders, but some became urban utilizers and dwellers successfully living in cities. Often, they are assumed to be attracted into urban areas by easily accessible and highly energetic anthropogenic food sources. We macroscopically analysed stomachs of 247 wild boar (Sus scrofa, hereafter WB) from urban areas of Berlin and from the surrounding rural areas. From the stomach contents we determined as predictors of food quality modulus of fineness (MOF,), percentage of acid insoluble ash (AIA) and macronutrients such as amount of energy and percentage of protein, fat, fibre and starch. We run linear mixed models to test: (1) differences in the proportion of landscape variables, (2) differences of nutrients consumed in urban vs. rural WB and (3) the impact of landscape variables on gathered nutrients. We found only few cases of anthropogenic food in the qualitative macroscopic analysis. We categorized the WB into five stomach content categories but found no significant difference in the frequency of those categories between urban and rural WB. The amount of energy was higher in stomachs of urban WB than in rural WB. The analysis of landscape variables revealed that the energy of urban WB increased with increasing percentage of sealing, while an increased human density resulted in poor food quality for urban and rural WB. Although the percentage of protein decreased in areas with a high percentage of coniferous forests, the food quality increased. High percentage of grassland decreased the percentage of consumed fat and starch and increased the percentage of fibre, while a high percentage of agricultural areas increased the percentage of consumed starch. Anthropogenic food such as garbage might serve as fallback food when access to natural resources is limited. We infer that urban WB forage abundant, natural resources in urban areas. Urban WB might use anthropogenic resources (e.g. garbage) if those are easier to exploit and more abundant than natural resources. This study shows that access to natural resources still is mandatory and drives the amount of protein, starch, fat or fibre in wild boar stomachs in urban as well as rural environments."

The other X chromosomes in cells of both sexes are silenced in utero by XIST, the Inactive X Specific Transcript gene, that is present on all X chromosomes. To investigate the means by which the human active X is protected from silencing by XIST, we updated the search for a key dosage sensitive XIST repressor using new cytogenetic data with more precise resolution. Here, based on a previously unknown sex bias in copy number variations, we identify a unique region in our genome, and propose candidate genes that lie within, as they could inactivate XIST. Unlike males, the females who duplicate this region of chromosome 19 (partial 19 trisomy) do not survive embryogenesis; this preimplantation loss of females may be one reason that more human males are born than females."

https://openalex.org/W2606092056,"Exposure to explosive blasts can produce functional debilitation in the absence of brain pathology detectable at the scale of current diagnostic imaging. Transient (ms) overpressure components of the primary blast wave are considered to be potentially damaging to the brain. Astrocytes participate in neuronal metabolic maintenance, blood-brain barrier, regulation of homeostatic environment, and tissue remodeling. Damage to astrocytes via direct physical forces has the potential to disrupt local and global functioning of neuronal tissue. Using an ex vivo brain slice model, we tested the hypothesis that viable astrocytes within the slice could be injured simply by transit of a single blast wave consisting of overpressure alone. A polymer split Hopkinson pressure bar (PSHPB) system was adapted to impart a single positive pressure transient with a comparable magnitude to those that might be present inside the head. A custom built test chamber housing the brain tissue slice incorporated revised design elements to reduce fluid space and promote transit of a uniform planar waveform. Confocal microscopy, stereology, and morphometry of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) immunoreactivity revealed that two distinct astrocyte injury profiles were identified across a 4 hr post-test survival interval: (a) presumed conventional astrogliosis characterized by enhanced GFAP immunofluorescence intensity without significant change in tissue area fraction and (b) a process comparable to clasmatodendrosis, an autophagic degradation of distal processes that has not been previously associated with blast induced neurotrauma. Analysis of astrocyte branching revealed early, sustained, and progressive differences distinct from the effects of slice incubation absent overpressure testing. Astrocyte vulnerability to overpressure transients indicates a potential for significant involvement in brain blast pathology and emergent dysfunction. The testing platform can isolate overpressure injury phenomena to provide novel insight on physical and biological mechanisms."

Breaking the whole period into onset, peak, and post-peak stages, the model was fitted again to examine the differences.Comparable copycat effects were found on both CB and non-CB suicide news. The only cross-method media effects were found in the onset stage when non-CB suicide news showed suppressing effect on CB suicides. CB suicides reported a significant self-excitation effect. A higher divorce rate and lower property price index were associated with significantly more suicides incidences and more suicide news.The emerging of CB suicide method did not substitute media coverage of non-CB suicide in HK. Media effects in this case were not limited to new suicide method or celebrity suicide. The effects were further fueled by adverse socio-economic conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2605727846,"Atherosclerotic plaque destabilization is the major determinant of most acute coronary events. Smooth muscle cell (SMC) death contributes to plaque destabilization. Here, we describe a novel antiapoptotic mechanism in vascular SMCs that involves interaction of nuclear glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) with apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease 1 (Ape1), the major oxidized DNA repair enzyme. GAPDH down-regulation potentiated H2O2-induced DNA damage and SMC apoptosis. Conversely, GAPDH overexpression decreased DNA damage and protected SMCs against apoptosis. Ape1 down-regulation reversed the resistance of GAPDH-overexpressing cells to DNA damage and apoptosis, which indicated that Ape1 is indispensable for GAPDH-dependent protective effects. GAPDH bound Ape1 in the SMC nucleus, and blocking (or oxidation) of GAPDH active site cysteines suppressed GAPDH/Ape1 interaction and potentiated apoptosis. GAPDH up-regulated Ape1 via a transcription factor homeobox protein Hox-A5-dependent mechanism. GAPDH levels were reduced in atherosclerotic plaque SMCs, and this effect correlated with oxidative stress and SMC apoptosis. Thus, we demonstrated that nuclear GAPDH/Ape1 interaction preserved Ape1 activity, reduced DNA damage, and prevented SMC apoptosis. Suppression of SMC apoptosis by maintenance of nuclear GAPDH/Ape1 interactions may be a novel therapy to increase atherosclerotic plaque stability.-Hou, X., Snarski, P., Higashi, Y., Yoshida, T., Jurkevich, A., Delafontaine, P., Sukhanov, S.

We further characterized a novel URF strain isolated from an HIV-infected MSM, GD698. Near full-length genome (NFLG) phylogenic analysis showed that this novel URF was composed of CRF07_BC and CRF55_01B, with two recombinant breakpoints (nt 6,003 and 8,251 relative to the HXB2 genome) in the vpu/env and env genes, respectively. Twenty six percent of the genome is classified as CRF55_01B, spanning part of vpu and most of the env gene. The remaining 74% of the genome is classified as CRF07_BC. Both the backbone CRF07_BC sequence and CRF55_01B fragment were clustered with the HIV-1 isolates found in MSM.

However, it rarely causes serious damage to its native hosts, the eastern honey bees Apis cerana. To better understand the mechanism of resistance of A. cerana against the V. destructor mite, we profiled the metabolic changes that occur in the honey bee brain during V. destructor infestation. Brain samples were collected from infested and control honey bees and then measured using an untargeted liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS)-based global metabolomics method, in which 7918 and 7462 ions in ESI+ and ESI- mode, respectively, were successfully identified. Multivariate statistical analyses were applied, and 64 dysregulated metabolites, including fatty acids, amino acids, carboxylic acid, and phospholipids, amongst others, were identified. Pathway analysis further revealed that linoleic acid metabolism; propanoate metabolism; and glycine, serine, and threonine metabolism were acutely perturbed. The data obtained in this study offer insight into the defense mechanisms of A. cerana against V. destructor mites and provide a better method for understanding the synergistic effects of parasitism on honey bee colonies."

Both drugs are active against RAS wild type metastatic colorectal cancer after chemotherapy failure, with similar efficacy and toxicity profiles. However, their cost and limited survival benefits may compromise incorporation in the Brazilian public healthcare system, the Unified Heath System (Sistema Único de Saúde) (SUS).A cost-effectiveness analysis was conducted using a Markov model from the Brazilian Public health perspective and a lifetime horizon in patients with RAS -wt mCRC. Transition probabilities and mortality rates were extracted from randomized studies. Treatment costs were obtained from price tables regulated by the Brazilian Health Ministry. The World Health Organization recommendation of three times GDP per capita was used to define the cost-effectiveness threshold.The use of cetuximab or panitumumab for chemotherapy-refractory mCRC patients resulted in 0.22 additional life-years relative to BSC, with incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) of $58,240 and $52,772 per LY, respectively. That exceeds the pre-specified threshold for cost-effectiveness. Acquisition of biological agents was the major driver of increased costs.Our economic evaluation demonstrates that both cetuximab and panitumumab are not a cost-effective approach in RAS-wt mCRC patients. Discussion about drug price should be prioritized to enable incorporation of these monoclonal antibodies in the SUS."
https://openalex.org/W2606983898,"Objective In this study, an Inca bundle was examined using computed tomography (CT). The primary aim was to determine the preservation status of bony and soft tissues, the sex, the age at the time of death, possible indicators for disease or even the cause of death, as well as the kind of mummification. A secondary aim was to obtain a brief overview of the wrapping in order to gain additional information on the cultural background. Materials and methods The bundle belongs to the Museum of Cultures in Basel, Switzerland, and was bought in Munich, Germany, in 1921. Radiocarbon dating of the superficial textile yielded a calibrated age between 1480 and 1650 AD. The mummy was investigated using multi-slice CT with slice thickness of 0.75 mm and 110 kilovolt. For standardized assessment of soft tissue preservation, a recently developed checklist was applied. Results CT revealed the mummy of a seven to nine year old boy with superior preservation of bony and soft tissues allowing detailed assessment. Indicators of neurofibromatosis type 1 (paravertebral and cutaneous neurofibromas, a breast neurofibroma, sphenoid wing dysplasia), Chagas disease (dilatation of the esophagus, stomach, rectum, and large amounts of feces), and lung infection (pleural adherence, calcifications), probably due to tuberculosis, were found. Furthermore, signs of peri-mortem violence (transection of the chest and a defect in the abdominal wall) were detected. CT images revealed a carefully performed wrapping. Conclusion CT examination of the Inca bundle proved to be an important non-destructive examination method. Standardized assessment, especially of the soft tissue structures, allowed for diagnoses of several diseases, indicating a multi-morbid child at the time of death. The careful wrapping pointed to a ceremonial burial. Within the cultural background, the signs of fatal violence were discussed as a possible result of war, murder, accident, or human sacrifice."

https://openalex.org/W2606088386,"The authors present a method for extracting polygon data of endocranial surfaces from CT images of human crania. Based on the fact that the endocast is the largest empty space in the crania, we automate a procedure for endocast extraction by integrating several image processing techniques. Given CT images of human crania, the proposed method extracts endocranial surfaces by the following three steps. The first step is binarization in order to fill void structures, such as diploic space and cracks in the skull. We use a void detection method based on mathematical morphology. The second step is watershed-based segmentation of the endocranial part from the binary image of the CT image. Here, we introduce an automatic initial seed assignment method for the endocranial region using the distance field of the binary image. The final step is partial polygonization of the CT images using the segmentation results as mask images. The resulting polygons represent only the endocranial part, and the closed manifold surfaces are computed even though the endocast is not isolated in the cranium. Since only the isovalue threshold and the size of void structures are required, the procedure is not dependent on the experience of the user. The present paper also demonstrates that the proposed method can extract polygon data of endocasts from CT images of various crania."
https://openalex.org/W2607320416,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are important regulators of localized mRNA translation in neuronal dendrites. The presence of RNA-induced silencing complex proteins in these compartments and the dynamic miRNA expression changes that occur in response to neuronal stimulation highlight their importance in synaptic plasticity. Previously, we demonstrated a novel interaction between the major RNA-induced silencing complex component Argounaute-2 (Ago2) and the BAR (bin/amphiphysin/rvs) domain protein PICK1. PICK1 recruits Ago2 to recycling endosomes in dendrites, where it inhibits miRNA-mediated translational repression. Chemical induction of long-term depression via NMDA receptor activation causes the dissociation of Ago2 from PICK1 and a consequent increase in dendritic miRNA-mediated gene silencing. The mechanism that underlies the regulation of PICK1-Ago2 binding is unknown. In this study, we demonstrate that the PICK1-Ago2 interaction is directly sensitive to Ca2+ ions so that high [Ca2+]free reduces PICK1 binding to Ago2. Mutating a stretch of C-terminal Ca2+-binding residues in PICK1 results in a complete block of NMDA-induced PICK1-Ago2 disassociation in cortical neurons. Furthermore, the same mutant also blocks NMDA-stimulated miRNA-mediated gene silencing. This study defines a novel mechanism whereby elevated [Ca2+] induced by NMDA receptor activation modulates Ago2 and miRNA activity via PICK1. Our work suggests a Ca2+-dependent process to regulate miRNA activity in neurons in response to the induction of long-term depression."

We therefore aimed to test the hypothesis that circulating markers of bone turnover correlate with LV function in a cohort of patients with primary hyperparathyroidism (pHPT). Cross-sectional data of 155 subjects with pHPT were analyzed who participated in the “Eplerenone in Primary Hyperparathyroidism” (EPATH) Trial. Multivariate linear regression analyses with LV ejection fraction (LVEF, systolic function) or peak early transmitral filling velocity (e’, diastolic function) as dependent variables and N-terminal propeptide of procollagen type 1 (P1NP), osteocalcin (OC), bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BALP), or beta-crosslaps (CTX) as the respective independent variable were performed. Analyses were additionally adjusted for plasma parathyroid hormone, plasma calcium, age, sex, HbA1c, body mass index, mean 24-hours systolic blood pressure, smoking status, estimated glomerular filtration rate, antihypertensive treatment, osteoporosis treatment, 25-hydroxy vitamin D and N-terminal pro-brain B-type natriuretic peptide. Independent relationships were observed between P1NP and LVEF (adjusted β-coefficient = 0.201, P = 0.035) and e’ (β = 0.188, P = 0.042), respectively. OC (β = 0.192, P = 0.039) and BALP (β = 0.198, P = 0.030) were each independently related with e’. CTX showed no correlations with LVEF or e’. In conclusion, high bone formation markers were independently and paradoxically related with better LV diastolic and, partly, better systolic function, in the setting of pHPT. Potentially cardio-protective properties of stimulated bone formation in the context of hyperparathyroidism should be explored in future studies."

The mRNA of the Tpt1 gene is over-expressed during liver regeneration. But, the function of the protein in regeneration is not known. To study the role of the protein in regeneration, the earthworm Eudrilus eugeniae was chosen. First, the full length cDNA of the Tpt1 gene was sequenced. The size of the cDNA is 504 bp and the protein has 167 amino acids. The highest level of TCTP expression was documented in the worm after three days of regeneration. The protein was found to be expressed specifically in the epithelial layer of the skin. During regeneration, the protein expression was found to be the highest at the tip of blastema. The pharmacological suppression of TCTP using nutlin-3 and TCTP RNAi experiments resulted in the failure of the regeneration process. The suppression of TCTP caused the arrest of proliferation in posterior amputated worms. The severe cell death was documented in the amputated region of nutlin-3 injected worm. The silencing of TCTP has blocked the modification of clitellar segments. The experiments confirm that TCTP has major functions in the upstream signalling of cell proliferation in the early regeneration process in E. eugeniae."

However, very little is known about dormant avian embryos at the cellular level. To investigate the molecular processes that occur in the chicken blastoderm during cold torpor, we performed transcriptome analysis and investigated cellular responses in dormant embryos. In embryos stored at low temperature, we observed up-regulation of genes and proteins related to endoplasmic reticulum stress and stress-activated protein kinase signaling. In addition, the proportion of early apoptotic cells rose dramatically during torpor, whereas the proportion of late apoptotic cells was unchanged. Cell cycle analysis revealed that mitotic arrest occurred at the G2 phase in a DNA damage–independent manner and that the arrest was alleviated after incubation at 37°C. Our data suggest that the dormant avian embryo tolerates cold stress by inducing stress-tolerance pathways, inhibiting late apoptosis, and triggering cell cycle arrest at the G2 phase.—Ko, M.

Systematic reviews (SRs) and meta-analyses (MAs) of randomized clinical trials are considered two of the best approaches to the summarization of high-quality evidence. However, methodological bias can reduce the validity of conclusions from these types of studies and subsequently impair the quality of decision making. As co-authorship is among the most well-documented forms of research collaboration, the present study aimed to explore whether authors’ collaboration methods might influence the methodological quality of SRs and MAs of psoriasis. Methodological quality was assessed by two raters who extracted information from full articles. After calculating total and per-item Assessment of Multiple Systematic Reviews (AMSTAR) scores, reviews were classified as low (0-4), medium (5-8), or high (9-11) quality. Article metadata and journal-related bibliometric indices were also obtained. A total of 741 authors from 520 different institutions and 32 countries published 220 reviews that were classified as high (17.2%), moderate (55%), or low (27.7%) methodological quality. The high methodological quality subnetwork was larger but had a lower connection density than the low and moderate methodological quality subnetworks; specifically, the former contained relatively fewer nodes (authors and reviews), reviews by authors, and collaborators per author. Furthermore, the high methodological quality subnetwork was highly compartmentalized, with several modules representing few poorly interconnected communities. In conclusion, structural differences in author-paper affiliation network may influence the methodological quality of SRs and MAs on psoriasis. As the author-paper affiliation network structure affects study quality in this research field, authors who maintain an appropriate balance between scientific quality and productivity are more likely to develop higher quality reviews."
https://openalex.org/W2606583800,"Throughout the breeding season, changing environmental and biological conditions can lead to variation in the reproductive landscape of many species. In alpine environments temperature is a key driver of behaviour for small ectotherms such as insects, but variable biotic factors such as mate quality and availability can also influence behaviour. Kosicuscola tristis is a small semelparous grasshopper of the Australian alpine region. In a rare behaviour among grasshoppers, K. tristis males engage in vigorous fights over access to females, involving mandible displays, kicking, biting and grappling. In this study we describe the variation in fighting behaviour of K. tristis throughout the breeding season and test several hypotheses related to temperature, body size, mating behaviour, and female quality. We show that K. tristis males are more aggressive toward each other at the end of the breeding season than at the beginning. This increased aggression is associated with decreased daily average temperatures (from ~20°C to ~9°C), decreased mating activity, increased female fecundity, and an unexpected trend toward an increase in female-to-male aggression. These results suggest that K. tristis is likely under increased selective pressure to time key life cycle events with favourable biological and climatic conditions. The stochastic nature of alpine environments combined with a relatively short life span and breeding season, as well as limited mating opportunities toward the end of the season may have contributed to the evolution of this extraordinary mating system."

Reliable tracking information is heavily dependent on the system under study and algorithms that correctly determine particle position between images. However, in a real environmental context with the presence of noise including particular or dissolved matter in water, and low and fluctuating light conditions, many algorithms fail to obtain reliable information. We propose a new algorithm, the Circular Symmetry algorithm (C-Sym), for detecting the position of a circular particle with high accuracy and precision in noisy conditions. The algorithm takes advantage of the spatial symmetry of the particle allowing for subpixel accuracy. We compare the proposed algorithm with four different methods using both synthetic and experimental datasets. The results show that C-Sym is the most accurate and precise algorithm when tracking micro-particles in all tested conditions and it has the potential for use in applications including tracking biota in their environment."

Recognizing land tenure as a long-standing point of tension in REDD+ planning, we argue that its engagement also has a key role to play in developing a legitimate PMRV. Using household surveys, key informant interviews, and participatory mapping exercises, we present three ‘lived’ land tenure contexts in Indonesia to highlight their socially and ecologically situated natures and to consider the role of tenure pluralism in shaping PMRV. We then raise and interrogate three questions for incorporating lived land tenure contexts into a legitimate PMRV system: 1) Who holds the right to conduct PMRV activities?; 2) How are the impacts of PMRV differentially distributed within local communities?; and 3) What is the relationship between tenure security and motivation to participate in PMRV?

We sought to examine the impact of changes in the household composition on risk of stroke and its types in Japanese population. Cox proportional hazard modelling was used to assess the risk of incident stroke and stroke types within a cohort of 77,001 Japanese men and women aged 45-74 years who experienced addition and/or loss of family members [spouse, child(ren), parent(s) and others] to their households over a five years interval (between 1990-1993 and 1995-1998). During 1,043,446 person-years of the follow-up for 35,247 men and 41,758 women, a total of 3,858 cases of incident stroke (1485 hemorrhagic and 2373 ischemic) were documented. When compared with a stable family composition, losing at least one family member was associated with 11-15% increased risk of stroke in women and men; hazard ratios (95% confidence interval) were 1.11 (1.01-1.22) and 1.15 (1.05-1.26), respectively. The increased risk was associated with the loss of a spouse, and was evident for ischemic stroke in men and hemorrhagic stroke in women. The addition of any family members to the household was not associated with risk of stroke in men, whereas the addition of a parent (s) to the household was associated with increased risk in women: 1.49 (1.09-2.28). When the loss of a spouse was accompanied by the addition of other family members to the household, the increased risk of stroke disappeared in men: 1.18 (0.85-1.63), but exacerbated in women: 1.58 (1.19-2.10). In conclusion, men who have lost family members, specifically a spouse have higher risk of ischemic stroke, and women who gained family members; specifically a parent (s) had the higher risk of hemorrhagic stroke than those with a stable family composition."

Most laboratories still depend on manual procedures for data handling and analyses, which translates into a delay and decreased efficiency in the delivery of NGS results to doctors and patients. Thus, there is high demand for developing an automatic and an easy-to-use NGS data analyses system. We developed comprehensive, automatic genetic analyses controller named Mobile Genome Express (MGE) that works in smartphones or other mobile devices.

We sequenced an Actrometrix control DNA containing multiple proven human mutations using a targeted sequencing panel, and the whole analysis was managed by MGE, and its data reviewing program called ELECTRO. All steps were processed automatically except for the final sequencing review procedure with ELECTRO to confirm mutations. The data analysis process was completed within several hours. We confirmed the mutations that we have identified were consistent with our previous results obtained by using multi-step, manual pipelines."
