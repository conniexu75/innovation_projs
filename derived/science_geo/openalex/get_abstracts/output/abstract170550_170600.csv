All three proteins have broad spectrum antimicrobial activity, with HBD3 consistently being the most potent. Additionally, HBD3 has significant bactericidal activity against Gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus at physiological salt concentrations. We have compared the multimeric state of the three β-defensins using NMR diffusion spectroscopy, dynamic and static light scattering, and analysis of the migration of the three β-defensins on a native gel. All three techniques are in agreement, suggesting that HBD-3 is a dimer, while HBD-1 and HBD-2 are monomeric. Subsequently, the NMR solution structures of HBD1 and HBD3 were determined using standard homonuclear techniques and compared with the previously determined solution structure of HBD2. Both HBD1 and HBD3 form well defined structures with backbone root mean square deviations of 0.451 and 0.616 Å, respectively. The tertiary structures of all three β-defensins are similar, with a short helical segment preceding a three-stranded antiparallel β-sheet. The surface charge density of each of the defensins is markedly different, with the surface of HBD3 significantly more basic. Analysis of the NMR data and structures led us to suggest that HBD3 forms a symmetrical dimer through strand β2 of the β-sheet. The increased anti-Staphylococcalactivity of HBD3 may be explained by the capacity of the protein to form dimers in solution at low concentrations, an amphipathic dimer structure, and the increased positive surface charge compared with HBD1 and HBD2.

In many vertebrates the primary family of antimicrobial peptides are the defensins, produced in neutrophils and epithelial cells (1Kaiser V. Diamond G. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2000; 68: 779-784PubMed Google Scholar, 2Schroder J.M. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1999; 56: 32-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), although related proteins are also found in insects and plants (2Schroder J.M. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1999; 56: 32-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 3Ganz T. Lehrer R.I. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1994; 6: 584-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). Defensins are small, 3–5 kDa cationic proteins constrained by three disulfide bonds. As a class of proteins, they have broad microbicidal activity against Gram-positive and -negative bacteria, yeast, and some enveloped viruses, although specific defensin peptides often have defined spectra of activity (2Schroder J.M. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1999; 56: 32-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Like many other antimicrobial peptides (4Epand R.M. Vogel H.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1462: 11-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (1155) Google Scholar), the defensin class of peptides is known to disrupt the membranes of microbes (5Lehrer R.I. Barton A. Daher K.A. Harwig S.S.

Chem. 2001; 276: 5707-5713Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1183) Google Scholar). It has recently been reported that in addition to their antimicrobial activity, defensins may act as chemokines, activating the adaptive immune response (8Territo M.C. Ganz T. Selsted M.E. Lehrer R. J. Clin. Invest. 1989; 84: 2017-2020Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar, 9Chertov O. Michiel D.F. Xu L. Wang J.M. Tani K. Murphy W.J. Longo D.L. Taub D.D. Oppenheim J.J. J. Biol.

Howard O.M. Oppenheim J.J. Science. 1999; 286: 525-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (1538) Google Scholar). The α-defensins were the first characterized human defensins (11Ganz T. Selsted M.E. Szklarek D. Harwig S.S. Daher K. Bainton D.F. Lehrer R.I. J. Clin. Invest. 1985; 76: 1427-1435Crossref PubMed Scopus (1153) Google Scholar), including the human neutrophil proteins HNP1–3, which are stored in neutrophil granules and are released after phagocytosis of an invading bacterium. The isolation of the inducible tracheal antimicrobial protein from epithelial cells (12Diamond G. Zasloff M. Eck H. Brasseur M. Maloy W.L. Bevins C.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3952-3956Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar) and the subsequent discovery of 13 peptides stored in the granules of bovine neutrophils (13Selsted M.E. Tang Y.Q. Morris W.L. McGuire P.A. Novotny M.J. Smith W. Henschen A.H. Cullor J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6641-6648Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) represented a second class of defensins termed the β-defensins. These peptides differed from the α-defensins in the location of their six Cys residues and the specific pairing of their disulfide bridges. Since the initial report of the existence of β-defensins, their presence in the epithelial cells of many other organisms including humans, sheep, mice, rats, pigs, and chickens have been described (1Kaiser V. Diamond G. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2000; 68: 779-784PubMed Google Scholar). The first human β-defensin (HBD1),1 initially isolated from hemofiltrates (14Bensch K.W. Raida M. Magert H.J. Schulz-Knappe P. Forssmann W.G. FEBS Lett. 1995; 368: 331-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar), was subsequently found in human urine (15Valore E.V. Park C.H. Quayle A.J. Wiles K.R. McCray Jr., P.B. Ganz T. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 1633-1642Crossref PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar) and has been determined to be primarily expressed in the kidney and female urogenital tract (15Valore E.V. Park C.H. Quayle A.J. Wiles K.R. McCray Jr., P.B. Ganz T. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 1633-1642Crossref PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar). In addition, it is abundantly expressed in breast milk (16Tunzi C.R. Harper P.A. Bar-Oz B. Valore E.V. Semple J.L. Watson-MacDonell J. Ganz T. Ito S. Pediatr. Res. 2000; 48: 30-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 17Jia H.P. Starner T. Ackermann M. Kirby P. Tack B.F. McCray Jr., P.B. J. Pediatr. 2001; 138: 109-112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). HBD1 was initially isolated as a mixture of forms of varying sizes (36–47 amino acids) due to proteolytic cleavage. Of these different forms, the recombinant 36-residue HBD1 was found to be consistently the most potent, even at high salt concentrations. HBD1 is constitutively expressed, and its expression is neither up-regulated by the presence of bacteria nor in response to an inflammatory stimulus (2Schroder J.M. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1999; 56: 32-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 18Zhao C. Wang I. Lehrer R.I. FEBS Lett. 1996; 396: 319-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). A second β-defensin was isolated from the skin of patients with psoriasis, and its sites of expression were determined to include the epithelial cells of the trachea, skin, and lung tissues (19Harder J. Bartels J. Christophers E. Schroder J.M. Nature. 1997; 387: 861Crossref PubMed Scopus (1194) Google Scholar). HBD2 is active against many Gram-negative bacteria, including Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa as well as the yeastCandida albicans but was only found to be bacteriostatic, not bactericidal, against the Gram-positive bacteria,Staphylococcus aureus. In contrast to HBD1, HBD2 is inducible after bacterial challenge, with the level of mRNA increasing in the presence of Gram-negative and -positive bacteria, yeast, and proinflammatory cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor α and interleukin-1β (2Schroder J.M. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1999; 56: 32-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 19Harder J. Bartels J. Christophers E. Schroder J.M.

Schroder J.M. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2000; 22: 714-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). As previously mentioned, both HBD1 and HBD2 have either little or no activity against S. aureus, which recently prompted Harderet al. (7Harder J. Bartels J. Christophers E. Schroder J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5707-5713Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1183) Google Scholar) to search for a β-defensin with increased potency against S. aureus. A third human β-defensin, HBD3, was subsequently isolated from the epidermal keratinocytes of patients with psoriasis. Concurrently, the gene encoding HBD3 was independently described by two groups (22Jia H.P. Schutte B.C. Schudy A. Linzmeier R. Guthmiller J.M. Johnson G.K. Tack B.F. Mitros J.P. Rosenthal A. Ganz T. McCray Jr., P.B. Gene. 2001; 263: 211-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar, 23Garcia J.R. Jaumann F. Schulz S. Krause A. Rodriguez-Jimenez J. Forssmann U. Adermann K. Kluver E. Vogelmeier C. Becker D. Hedrich R. Forssmann W.G. Bals R. Cell Tissue Res. 2001; 306: 257-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar) based on the observation that both the α and β defensins exist as a gene cluster on chromosome 8p23-p22. HBD3 is much more basic compared with the two other human β-defensins, having a total of 13 Arg and Lys residues compared with 6 and 7 cationic residues for HBD1 and HBD2, respectively. HBD3 possesses bactericidal activity against Gram-positive and -negative bacteria, including multi-drug-resistant S. aureus, vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium, andBurkholderia cepacia in addition to the yeast C. albicans (7Harder J. Bartels J. Christophers E. Schroder J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5707-5713Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1183) Google Scholar, 23Garcia J.R. Jaumann F. Schulz S. Krause A.

Starner and P. McCray, unpublished observations. HBD3 was demonstrated to retain its microbicidal activity against S. aureus at physiological salt concentrations although demonstrating little hemolytic activity in the presence of phosphate-buffered saline. A synthetic HBD3 peptide has recently been reported to form non-selective ion channels in the membranes of Xenopus laevis oocytes (23Garcia J.R. Jaumann F. Schulz S. Krause A. Rodriguez-Jimenez J. Forssmann U. Adermann K. Kluver E. Vogelmeier C. Becker D. Hedrich R. Forssmann W.G. Bals R. Cell Tissue Res. 2001; 306: 257-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). Like HBD2, HBD3 expression is inducible by external stimuli, including interleukin-1β, tumor necrosis factor-α, interferon-γ, and Gram-negative and -positive bacteria (7Harder J. Bartels J. Christophers E. Schroder J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5707-5713Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1183) Google Scholar, 22Jia H.P. Schutte B.C. Schudy A. Linzmeier R. Guthmiller J.M.

Expression of HBD3 is localized to heart, skeletal muscle, placenta, esophagus, trachea, oral mucosa, and skin tissues (22Jia H.P. Schutte B.C. Schudy A. Linzmeier R. Guthmiller J.M. Johnson G.K. Tack B.F. Mitros J.P. Rosenthal A. Ganz T. McCray Jr., P.B. Gene. 2001; 263: 211-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar,23Garcia J.R. Jaumann F. Schulz S. Krause A. Rodriguez-Jimenez J.

The three-dimensional structures of a number of defensins have been determined by both NMR and x-ray crystallography techniques (reviewed in Ref. 6White S.H. Wimley W.C. Selsted M.E. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1995; 5: 521-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). The first β-defensin structure to be determined was for bovine neutrophil β-defensin 12 (24). Recently, the first structures of a human β-defensin were reported for HBD2 by NMR (25Sawai M.V. Jia H.P. Liu L. Aseyev V. Wiencek J.M. McCray Jr., P.B. Ganz T. Kearney W.R. Tack B.F. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 3810-3816Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) and x-ray crystallography techniques (26Hoover D.M. Rajashankar K.R. Blumenthal R. Puri A. Oppenheim J.J. Chertov O. Lubkowski J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32911-32918Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). In addition, the x-ray crystal structure of HBD1 has recently been described (27Hoover D.M. Chertov O. Lubkowski J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39021-39026Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). The structures of a number of proteins found in scorpion and marsupial venoms appear to have structural folds similar to the defensin family (28Bontems F. Gilquin B. Roumestand C. Menez A. Toma F. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 7756-7764Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 29Torres A.M. de Plater G.M. Doverskog M. Birinyi-Strachan L.C. Nicholson G.M. Gallagher C.H. Kuchel P.W. Biochem. J. 2000; 348: 649-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The ability of β-defensins to act in a similar manner to chemokines has been exemplified by the structural similarities observed for β-defensins and chemokines, as recently reported for the NMR structure of MIP-3α (30Pérez-Cañadillas J.M. Zaballos Á. Gutiérrez J. Varona R. Roncal F. Albar J.P. Marquez G. Bruix M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28372-28379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). We describe here the NMR solution structures of two human β-defensins, HBD1 and HBD3. Additionally, various techniques, including light scattering, NMR diffusion, and native gel electrophoresis, were utilized to determine the multimeric states of HBD1–3 at various concentrations. The two human β-defensin solution structures have been compared with the previously determined solution structure of HBD2. The NMR structures, in combination with the information on the multimeric states of the three defensins, have been interpreted in an attempt to explain the biological differences observed among these three related antimicrobial proteins. HBD1 (36 residues), HBD2 (41 residues), and HBD3 (45 residues) were recombinantly produced in E. coli using a proprietary fusion protein expression system by Peprotech (Rocky Hill, NJ). After purification, the peptides were refolded, and the disulfide bonds were oxidized. The purity of the peptides was verified by mass spectroscopy and capillary electrophoresis, demonstrating homogenous preparations for each of the peptides. Only single bands representing the monomeric form of each of the β-defensins were detected of the appropriate mass and charge. In addition, high performance liquid chromatography of HBD3 demonstrated an identical elution profile as the native peptide. 3J. Harder and J. M. Schröder, personal communication. Our NMR results (see “Spectral Acquisition/Assignment”in the “Results” section) confirmed the homogeneity of the preparation. The antimicrobial properties of the recombinant peptides were confirmed by a radial diffusion assay.2Additionally, the activity of the recombinant HBD3 has been independently compared with the native peptide, with no significant differences observed.3 Perdeuterated D2O was purchased from Cambridge Isotope laboratories, Inc. (Andover, MA). Electrophoresis of 1 μg of HBD1, HBD2, and HBD3 was performed under reduced and non-reduced conditions. Each sample contained 1 μg of peptide and 10 μl of 2× sample buffer (Novex Tricine SDS sample buffer LC1676). In addition, the reduced samples contained 2 μl of 500 mm dithiothreitol (50 mm final concentration). All samples were diluted with 0.02% acetic acid to a total volume of 20 μl and heated to 100 °C for 5 min. The entire sample was loaded and run on a 16% Tricine gel (Invitrogen, EC66952). The gel was then stained with Coomassie dye. For light-scattering studies, solutions of various protein concentrations were prepared in 0.1m Tris, pH 8.0, buffer. The previously determined extinction coefficient for HBD2 (25Sawai M.V. Jia H.P. Liu L. Aseyev V. Wiencek J.M. McCray Jr., P.B. Ganz T. Kearney W.R. Tack B.F. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 3810-3816Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) of 0.43 ml mg−1cm−1 was used for purposes of determining HBD2 concentrations. Furthermore, in this study an extinction coefficient of 0.64 ml mg−1 cm−1 was independently determined for HBD3 by methods described earlier (25Sawai M.V. Jia H.P. Liu L. Aseyev V. Wiencek J.M. McCray Jr., P.B. Ganz T. Kearney W.R. Tack B.F. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 3810-3816Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Static and dynamic light-scattering measurements were conducted with a DynaPro molecular sizing instrument (Protein Solution Inc.) operating at a wavelength of 822.4 nm. In the static light-scattering experiments, molecular masses were determined using the Debye analysis (31Kratochvil P. Classical Light Scattering from Polymer Solutions. Elsevier Science Publishers B. V., Amsterdam1987Google Scholar). Calculated molecular masses were determined based on the sequences of the peptides. The change in the refractive index of protein solutions as a function of protein concentration (increment of refractive index, dn/dc) was assumed to be similar to that of most peptides. The dn/dc value of 0.20 ml/g was taken for molecular mass analysis. To estimate the hydrodynamic radii of the proteins in solution, dynamic light-scattering studies were also performed. The correlation functions of the scattered light intensity were analyzed using the regularization algorithm utilizing an inverse Laplace transformation (32Stepánek P. Brown W. Dynamic Light Scattering: The Method and Some Applications. Oxford University Press, New York1993Google Scholar). All light-scattering studies were carried out at 20 °C and at a 90° scattering angle. The NMR samples for HBD1 and HBD3 were made by dissolving ∼1–2 mg of purified protein in 540 μl of H2O and 60 μl of D2O. The unbuffered pH was adjusted to 4.5 and 4.0 for HBD1 and HBD3, respectively. The concentration of each of the samples was determined by UV absorption in aqueous solution at 280 nm and calculated molar extinction coefficients of 4200 and 2920 m−1 cm−1 for HBD1 and HBD3, respectively. To determine the optimal NMR conditions for each of the proteins, two-dimensional NOESY (mixing times of 400 and 150 ms for HBD1 and HBD3, respectively) and TOCSY (mixing times of 120 ms) spectra were acquired at 25, 30, and 37 °C on a Bruker Avance 500-MHz NMR spectrometer equipped with a Cryo-probeTM. The spectra collected at 25 °C were determined to provide the optimal resolution of overlapping NMR signals for both HBD1 and HBD3; therefore, this temperature was used for further studies of the proteins. For HBD3 and HBD1, a series of NOESY spectra were collected with mixing times between 50–500 and 100–800 ms, respectively, to determine the point at which spin-diffusion occurred. All spectra were acquired with 2048 × 600 data points in the F2 and F1dimensions, and sweep widths of 6009 Hz. In all NOESY and TOCSY spectra water suppression was achieved using excitation sculpting (33Callihan D. West J. Kumar S. Schweitzer B.l. Logan T.l. J. Magn. Reson. 1996; 112: 82-85Crossref Scopus (54) Google Scholar). A DQF-COSY spectrum with 4096 × 512 data points was also acquired to aid in the assignment of different spin systems. To determine the J-coupling constants of these proteins two-dimensional DQF-COSY spectra of both HBD1 and HBD3 were acquired on a Varian 800-MHz NMR spectrometer at NANUC, the National High Field Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Center (University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta). Spectra at 800 MHz were acquired at 25 °C with 8192 × 2048 data points and sweep widths of 10000 × 9000 Hz for the respectiveF2 and F1 dimensions. The water signal was suppressed using a 3-9-19 watergate pulse sequence with gradients and presaturation during the relaxation delay. J-couplings were measured from the 800-MHz DQF-COSY spectra by extracting one-dimensional slices through each of the HN-Hα multiplet peaks and measuring the couplings directly using XWINNMR (Bruker, Analytische Messtechnik GmbH). All spectra were zero-filled and multiplied by a shifted sine-bell curve using the NMRPipe software package (34Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (11638) Google Scholar). To determine which amides were in slow exchange, the HBD1 and HBD3 NMR samples were lyophilized from H2O and re-dissolved in 99.9% D2O. Immediately after this, one-dimensional1H spectrum was acquired followed by a series of one- and two-dimensional 1H spectra over the following 24 h. For the NMR diffusion experiments, the HBD1 and HBD3 NMR samples in D2O were used. Additionally, an NMR sample for HBD2 was also prepared by dissolving ∼2 mg of protein in 99.9% D2O with the pH adjusted to 4.5. The concentration was determined using UV absorption in aqueous solution at 280 nm, with a calculated molar extinction coefficient of 1640m−1 cm−1. Approximately 5 μl of a 1% solution of dioxane in D2O was added to each of the samples as an internal standard. Pulsed field gradient diffusion experiments were collected with the PG-SLED sequence (35Merrill M.R. J. Magn. Reson. 1993; 103: 223-225Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 36Gibbs S.J. Johnson Jr., C.S. J. Magn. Reson. 1991; 93: 395-402Google Scholar). The data was acquired by collecting 56 scans at each step and incrementing the gradient strength in 64 steps from 1.25 to 80% of the maximum gradient output of the linear amplifier. Data were initially processed using an inverse Laplace transform in the diffusion software addition to the Bruker XWINNMR package (version 2.6). From the resulting diffusion spectrum, not less then 10 protein resonances were chosen, and the decay of the peak intensities as a function of gradient strength was evaluated using the XWINNMR package. NMR spectra were analyzed using NMRView 4.1.3 (37Johnson B.A. Blevins R.A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1994; 4: 603-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (2686) Google Scholar) on PC workstations running the Redhat 7.1 version of the Linux operating system. All NMR spectra were initially referenced to H2O at 4.77 ppm and subsequently referenced to dioxane at 3.751 ppm (separately referenced to 2,2-dimethyl-2-silapentane-5-sulfonic acid (DSS)). The assignment of the protein chemical shifts was determined using the method of Wüthrich (38Wüthrich K. NMR of Proteins and Nucleic Acids. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1986Crossref Google Scholar). NOE-based distance restraints were collected from NOESY spectra and separated into three groups, strong (1.8–2.8 Å), medium (1.8–3.4 Å), and weak (1.8–5.0 Å), based on peak intensity by estimating the populations of each of these groups using the guess bins routine in NMRView 4.1.3. Where necessary, a pseudo-atom correction was added to the distance restraints for degenerate and non-stereospecifically assigned protons (38Wüthrich K. NMR of Proteins and Nucleic Acids. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1986Crossref Google Scholar). The φ dihedral angles were constrained by the addition of Karplus coupling constant constraints when the coupling constants measured from the DQF-COSY spectra measured at 800 MHz exceeded 8 Hz. Additionally, for the non-Gly and -Pro residues of HBD3, where a coupling constant could not reliably be determined, a broad dihedral angle restraint was used to restrain the φ-dihedral angle between −35° and −180°. The NOE distance restraints and dihedral angle restraints were then used to create initial protein structures starting from extended structures using the program CNS (version 1.0) (39Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.-S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16979) Google Scholar). Additionally, the 6 Cys residues were constrained to form three disulfide bonds based on the known disulfide pairing pattern of the β-defensins (13Selsted M.E. Tang Y.Q. Morris W.L. McGuire P.A.

CNS uses both a simulated annealing protocol and molecular dynamics to produce low energy structures with the minimum distance and geometry restraint violations. In general, the default parameters supplied with the program were used with 100 structures generated for each CNS run. The protein structures were further refined using the program ARIA (41Nilges M. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 245: 645-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar, 42Nilges M. Fold. Des. 1997; 2: 53-57Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 43Nilges M.

NMR. 1999; 13: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar) on an SGI R12000 work station. ARIA enables the incorporation of ambiguous NOE distance restraints into the structure calculations as well as calibrating the NOE distance restraints using a structure-based NOE back-calculation. ARIA runs were performed using the default parameters supplied in the program. In the final ARIA run the number of structures generated in the eighth iteration was increased to 100, and 20 structures were kept based on lowest energy. The effect of reducing the disulfide bonds of the three human β-defensins on their relative mobilities in a Tricine-acrylamide gel is shown in Fig.1. Before reduction of the disulfide bonds, HBD1 and HBD2 migrate on the gel with similar mobilities, whereas HBD3 ran significantly slower. It can be deduced by comparison to molecular weight standards that when the disulfide bonds are intact, HBD3 migrates as a dimer, whereas HBD1 and HBD2 migrate as monomers. After reduction of the disulfide bonds with dithiothreitol, the mobility of all three β-defensins increased, with their relative mobilities becoming more similar. We take this to indicate that cleavage of the disulfide bonds results in a disruption of the tertiary structure of HBD3 and the subsequent loss of a stable dimer structure. The physical state of HBD2 and HBD3 in solution was studied using dynamic and static light-scattering methods. Studies were performed on solutions ranging in protein concentration from 2.4 to 36.4 mg/ml. Proteins were first characterized with static light scattering as an absolute method for molecular mass analysis (Fig. 2 A). Molecular masses of HBD2 and HBD3 were determined at infinite dilution as 4300 ± 400 and 9600 ± 800 Da, respectively. These values were then compared with values estimated from dynamic light scattering. All size distributions obtained in dynamic light-scattering experiments were narrow and unimodal, indicating an absence of large in"

https://openalex.org/W2045180080,"Ancient asexuals directly contradict the evolutionary theories that explain why organisms should evolve a sexual life history. The mutualistic, arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi are thought to have been asexual for approximately 400 million years. In the absence of sex, highly divergent descendants of formerly allelic nucleotide sequences are thought to evolve in a genome. In mycorrhizal fungi, where individual offspring receive hundreds of nuclei from the parent, it has been hypothesized that a population of genetically different nuclei should evolve within one individual. Here we use DNA-DNA fluorescent in situ hybridization to show that genetically different nuclei co-exist in individual arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. We also show that the population genetics techniques used in other organisms are unsuitable for detecting recombination because the assumptions and underlying processes do not fit the fungal genomic structure shown here. Instead we used a phylogenetic approach to show that the within-individual genetic variation that occurs in arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi probably evolved through accumulation of mutations in an essentially clonal genome, with some infrequent recombination events. We conclude that mycorrhizal fungi have evolved to be multi-genomic."

We recently showed that VEGF promoter activity is inversely correlated with tumor extracellular pH (pHo) in vivo in the human glioma (U87 MG) xenografts. Here we show that substitution of the neutral culture medium (pH 7.3) with acidic pH medium (pH 6.6) up-regulates VEGF mRNA and protein production in human glioblastoma cells as reflected by Northern blot analysis and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Functional analysis of the VEGF promoter reveals that the sequence between −961 bp and −683 bp upstream of the transcription start site is responsible for the transcriptional activation of the VEGF gene by acidic pH. This region contains the binding site for AP-1. Consequently, AP-1luciferase reporter gene was activated by acidic pH. Gel-shift analysis confirmed that AP-1 DNA binding activity is induced under acidic pH. While investigating the upstream signaling pathways, we found that ERK1/2 MAPK is activated and translocates to the nucleus to activate Elk-1, and inhibition of the activation of ERK by specific inhibitors of MEK1 blocks the up-regulation of VEGF by low pH. Dominant negative forms of Ras and Raf abolished the activation of VEGF promoter by acidic pH. These results show that acidic pH activates Ras and the ERK1/2 MAPK pathway to enhance VEGFtranscription via AP-1, leading to increased VEGF production.

Acidic extracellular pH (pHo) is another common feature of solid tumors (12.Helmlinger G. Yuan F. Dellian M. Jain R.K. Nat.

Tumor pHo is on an average 0.5 pH unit lower than the corresponding normal tissue pHo(14.Wike-Hooley J.L. Haveman J. Reinhold H.S. Radiother. Oncol. 1984; 2: 343-366Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (805) Google Scholar). Although a great deal is known about the effect of hypoxia on gene expression and function in tumors, our knowledge of the effect of low pH on gene expression is still in its infancy. Recently, we have shown that VEGF promoter activity inversely correlates with tumor pHo in a human glioma xenograft in vivo (15.Fukumura D. Xu L. Chen Y. Gohongi T. Seed B. Jain R.K. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 6020-6024PubMed Google Scholar). Yet to be determined are whether there is a causal relationship between tumor acidic pHo and VEGF expression in human glioma cells and the underlying mechanisms thereof. MAPKs play a key role in the transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of VEGF (16.Pages G. Milanini J. Richard D.E. Berra E. Gothie E. Vinals F. Pouyssegur J. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2000; 902: 187-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). MAPKs are a family of serine/threonine kinases that are activated through a signaling pathway triggered by growth factors, stress, hormones, lymphokines, extracellular matrix components, and tumor promoters (17.Cavalli V. Vilbois F. Corti M. Marcote M.J. Tamura K. Karin M. Arkinstall S. Gruenberg J. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 421-432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Protein kinase phosphorylation events are involved in the regulation of gene expression by activating transcription factors and through post-transcriptional mechanisms (18.Treisman R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 205-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (1156) Google Scholar). Mammalian cells express several groups of MAPKs, including extracellular signal-related kinases (ERK)-1/2, Jun amino-terminal kinases (JNK) and p38 proteins. The best-characterized function is their regulation of transcription factor AP-1 (19.Kallunki T. Deng T. Hibi M. Karin M. Cell. 1996; 87: 929-939Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). The MAPK activity is regulated through three-tiered cascades: MEK1/2 activates ERK1/2, MKK3/6 activates p38, and MKK4/7 (JNK1/2) activates JNK. Each MAPKK can be activated by more than one MAPKKK, increasing the complexity and diversity of MAPK signaling (17.Cavalli V. Vilbois F. Corti M. Marcote M.J. Tamura K. Karin M. Arkinstall S. Gruenberg J. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 421-432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Ras triggers activation of MAPK; Raf-1 (MEK) serine/threonine kinase is one of the downstream effectors of Ras (20.Cowley S. Paterson H. Kemp P. Marshall C.J.

Biol. 1995; 15: 6443-6453Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar). Ras has been shown to play a significant role in the expression of VEGF (22.White M.A. Nicolette C. Minden A. Polverino A. Van Aelst L. Karin M. Wigler M.H. Cell. 1995; 80: 533-541Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar). Here, we hypothesize that acidic pH up-regulates VEGF expression in human glioblastoma cells. We show that VEGF mRNA and protein production are increased with incubation in acidic pH medium. Then, we show that the induction of VEGF involves activation of the VEGF gene transcription. The transcriptional activation of VEGF is mediated by AP-1, and ERK1/2 MAPK is required. By blocking Ras and Raf with the use of their dominant negative mutants, we demonstrate that Ras and Raf act as important intermediary molecules in acidic pH-mediated overexpression of VEGF. U0126 and PD098059 (Calbiochem, San Diego, CA) were used at final concentrations of 10 and 50 mm, respectively. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies to phospho-ERK1/2, ERK1/2, and phospho-Elk-1 were purchased from Cell Signaling, Inc. (Beverly, MA). The U87 MG human glioma cell line was obtained from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA). The tumor cell line was maintained in monolayer cultures in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen, Gaithersburg, MD). To vary the medium's pH, serum-free medium (BioWhitaker, Rockland, ME) was used; pH was adjusted with 20 mm MES and 20 mm Tris (23.Lee A.H. Tannock I.F. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 1901-1908PubMed Google Scholar). Northern blot was performed as described previously (24.Xu L. Xie K. Mukaida N. Matsushima K. Fidler I.J. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 5822-5829PubMed Google Scholar). VEGF and β-actincDNA probes were synthesized by PCR using primers for VEGF: 5′-TCC GGA TCC ATG AAC TTT C-3′ and 5′-TGG CTC ACC GCC TTG GCT-3′; and for β-actin: 5′-TGT ATG CCT CTG GTC GTA CC-3′ and 5′-CAA CGT CAC ACT TCA TGA TGG-3′. VEGF protein production was analyzed by ELISA using the Quantikine VEGF ELISA kit (R&D Systems) according to the manufacturer's instructions. All deletion constructs were derived from the 2.8-kb hVEGF fragment described previously (GenBankTMM63971) (25.Fukumura D. Xavier R. Sugiura T. Chen Y. Park E.C. Lu N. Selig M. Nielsen G. Taksir T.

RasV12, RasN17, RafCAAX, and RafS621A were obtained from CLONTECH (Palo Alto, CA). Transient transfection and reporter gene assays were performed as described previously (24.Xu L. Xie K. Mukaida N. Matsushima K. Fidler I.J. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 5822-5829PubMed Google Scholar). The cells were co-transfected with 20 mg of the serial deletion constructs of VEGF promoter and 2 mg of pRL-TK/plate using the calcium phosphate method. pRL-TK, obtained from Promega (Madison, WI) contains the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase promoter region upstream of Renilla luciferase and was used as an internal control for transfection efficiency. The transfected cells were then exposed for 6 h to neutral or acidic pH conditions. Cell lysates were prepared using the Dual Luciferase Assay System (Promega). The light intensity was measured on 20 ml of cell lysates using a luminometer. EMSA was performed using nuclear extracts prepared from U87 MG cells cultured for various time periods under neutral or acidic pH conditions. For EMSA experiments, the following double-stranded oligonucleotides were used: HIF-1a, 5′-TGC ATA CGT GGG CTC CAA CAG-3′; AP-2, 5′-GAT CGA ACT GAC CGC CCG CGG CCC GT-3′; Sp-1, 5′-ATT CGA TCG GGG CGG GGC GAG C-3′; AP-1, 5′-GTA GGT TTG AAT CAT CAC GCA GGC-3′; AP-1 mutant, 5′-GTA GGT TAG AAT CAT CAC GCA-3′. Bold indicates mutated base pair. For competition assays, 50-fold molar excess of unlabeled oligonucleotide was added to the binding reaction. Where indicated, anti-c-Jun, anti-c-Fos, anti-JunB, and anti-JunD antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies, Santa Cruz, CA) were added to the binding reaction in supershift analysis (24.Xu L. Xie K. Mukaida N. Matsushima K. Fidler I.J. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 5822-5829PubMed Google Scholar). U87 MG cells were incubated in serum-free medium overnight and then incubated in either neutral pH (pH 7.3) or acidic pH (pH 6.6) for different time points. Then the cells were scraped from plates, pelleted, and resuspended in lysis buffer. 30 mg of protein per sample was separated on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. The expression of ERK1/2 was detected by polyclonal antibodies against ERK1/2 (1:1000) and phosphorylated ERK1/2 (1:1000). U87 MG cells grown on a glass slide were fixed with cold (−20 °C) methanol for 20 min at room temperature without previous PBS wash. After blocking with 2% normal goat serum with 0.3% Triton-X in PBS for 1 h at room temperature, fixed cells were incubated with 1:250 diluted anti-phospho-ERK1/2 antibody at 4 °C overnight. Then cells were washed three times with PBS and incubated with fluorescence isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG antibody (1:300) for 1 h at room temperature. Finally, cells were washed three times with PBS, mounted under glass coverslides with Vectashield mounting media (Vector, Fremont, CA), and examined under epifluorescent illumination with excitation-emission filters for fluorescence isothiocyanate. Subconfluent cultures of U87 MG cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.5% FBS for 24 h at 37 °C. U87 MG cells were then incubated in neutral pH or acidic pH medium for different time periods. Cells were then washed rapidly with ice-cold PBS and immediately lysed in lysis buffer. Two-hundred microliters of total cellular extract was immunoprecipitated with an immobilized phospho-ERK1/2 antibody, washed, and incubated with an Elk-1 fusion protein as a substrate. This allows immunoprecipitated active ERK1/2 to phosphorylate Elk-1. Phosphorylation of Elk-1 was measured by Western blotting using a phospho-Elk-1 antibody. The significance of the data was analyzed by the Student's t test (two tailed). U87 MG cells were incubated in acidic pH (pH 6.6) medium for different time period. Then, supernatant were collected for ELISA, and the cells were lysed for Northern blot analysis. Incubation in acidic pH resulted in an increase in VEGF mRNA in a time-dependent manner. A rapid increase of VEGFtranscripts was observed 1 h following incubation in acidic pH medium and reached a plateau after 2 h (Fig. 1A). As shown in Fig. 1B, acidic pH stimulation of U87 MG cells led to an increase in VEGF protein levels in the culture medium, from 1749 ± 87 pg/ml in neutral pH medium to 4910 ± 245 pg/ml in acidosis for 8 h. The induction of VEGF protein is not obvious before 8 h, presumably due to the time (4–6 h) required for the protein to accumulate. These data support the association between acidic pH stimulation and induction of VEGF mRNA and protein secretion. To test whether acidic pH activates the VEGF promoter in vitro, 2.8 kb of the VEGF promoter region were subcloned and tested using the luciferase reporter gene. Transiently transfected U87 MG cells were incubated in neutral or acidic pH medium for 6 h. Fig. 2 shows that VEGF promoter was activated up to 3-fold upon incubation in acidic pH, indicating that the induction of VEGF production involves transcriptional activation. Based on the data obtained from the reporter gene assay, we expected cis-acting elements to control the transcriptional activation of the VEGF gene in response to acidic pH. To determine the sequences in the VEGF promoter that contribute to the acidic pH response in U87 MG cells, we constructed and analyzed the activities of different regions of the VEGF promoter. Fig. 3A shows the different constructs used in the reporter gene assays. Acidic pH induction was significantly decreased (p < 0.001) by shortening the promoter to −683 bp (Fig. 3B). The loss of promoter activation suggests a truncation of transcription factor binding sites in the −961 bp to −683 bp region that are required to response to acidic pH. This region contains the AP-1 DNA binding sequence. Next we used 4xTRE-luc to study the response of the AP-1 response element to acidic pH. 4xTRE-luc was co-transfected with pRL-TK into U87 MG cells. Transiently transfected cells were then split and incubated in pH 7.3 or pH 6.6 medium. Fig. 3C shows that the luciferase reporter driven by TRE was induced about 4-fold by acidic pH. To confirm the specific role of AP-1 transcription factor in the regulation of the VEGF promoter, we utilized an oligonucleotide probe corresponding to the AP-1 binding sequence in the VEGF promoter in the EMSA experiments. Radioactively labeled AP-1 probes were incubated with nuclear protein extracts from U87 MG cells that had been exposed to either neutral or acidic pH medium. Nuclear proteins extracted from unstimulated cells did not form any complexes. Exposure of the U87 MG cells to acidosis resulted in a substantial increase in the binding activity of AP-1, which peaked at 1 h after incubation in acidic medium (Fig. 4A). The binding specificity of the complexes formed was determined by competition with a excess (50 m) of unlabeled oligonucleotide containing the AP-1 consensus binding site and unrelated NF-κB oligonucleotides. The formation of the complex was inhibited by the unlabeled AP-1 probe and unaffected by NF-κB probe. Point mutations introduced into the AP-1 oligonucleotide prevented the formation of the shifted complex (Fig. 4B). In combination with the reporter gene data, this finding suggests that AP-1 complex mediates the acidic pH activated VEGF transcription. Addition of radiolabeled HIF-1a, Sp-1, and AP-2 oligonucleotide probes to the nuclear extract did not reveal any differences in the binding pattern and affinity of the DNA-protein complexes in neutral and acidic pH medium (Fig. 4C). This result agrees with the serial deletion promoter assay and suggests that HIF-1a, AP-2, and Sp-1 binding sites are not involved in VEGF induction by acidic pH in U87 MG cells. The transcription factor AP-1 is composed of members of the Fos family (c-Fos, Fos-B, Fra-1, and Fra-2) and the Jun family (c-Jun, JunB, and JunD) that form restricted homo- or heterodimers (27.Karin M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16483-16486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2239) Google Scholar). Therefore, we performed supershift assays to determine which AP-1 family member is activated and involved in the formation of the complexes by using antibodies against c-Jun, c-Fos, JunB, and JunD. Supershifted bands were detectable with antibody against c-Fos and JunD (Fig. 4D). Altogether, these data demonstrate that AP-1 transcription factors are activated and bind to the VEGF promoter in acidic pH medium. MAPKs are involved in the induction of c-Fos and Jun, which heterodimerize to form AP-1 complexes and bind to the promoter region to activate gene transcription (18.Treisman R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 205-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (1156) Google Scholar). Thus, we sought to determine whether MAPKs are activated during acidic pH and mediate VEGF induction. Using an anti-phospho-ERK1/2 antibody, which recognizes the active forms of ERK1/2 (p42/p44), a hyperphosphorylated form of ERK1/2 could be detected after 10-min incubation in acidic medium (Fig. 5A). Using antibodies raised against total ERK1/2, no modification in the level of ERK MAPK expression was detected (Fig. 5A). This result indicates that the increase in ERK1/2 phosphorylation was not due to an increase in total ERK1/2 proteins production. Furthermore, the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 was inhibited by pre-treatment of the cells with specific inhibitors of MEK1, PD98059 (50 μm), and U0126 (10 μm) (Fig. 5B). We observed a more potent inhibitory effect of U0126 on phosphorylation of ERK1/2, because U0126 inhibits constitutively active MEK1 with an IC50 of 0.07 μm, whereas PD98059 inhibits at an IC50 of 10 μm (28.Favata M.F. Horiuchi K.Y. Manos E.J. Daulerio A.J. Stradley D.A. Feeser W.S. Van Dyk D.E. Pitts W.J. Earl R.A. Hobbs F. Copeland R.A. Magolda R.L. Scherle P.A. Trzaskos J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18623-18632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2728) Google Scholar). A Western blot for phospho-JNK/SAPK and p38 MAPK did not reveal any detectable phosphorylated kinases (data not shown). Because many of the nuclear substrates of MAPK are transcription factors, MAPK nuclear translocation is thought to represent a crucial step in the modulation of gene expression. Therefore, we tested whether ERK1/2 translocates to the nucleus under acidic pH. Fluorescent immunostaining shows basal levels of phospho-ERK1/2 predominantly cytoplasmic in cells incubated in pH 7.3 medium (Fig. 6A), whereas it is relocated to the nucleus in cells incubated under acidic pH (Fig. 6B). Addition of the specific MEK inhibitor PD98059 and U0126 was sufficient to block the phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of ERK1/2 MAPK in response to acidic pH. To investigate whether this hyperphosphorylated ERK1/2 MAPK correlated with functional activation of MAPK, an in vitro MAPK assay was performed. U87 MG cells were incubated in neutral or acidic pH medium for different time periods. Phosphorylation of Elk-1 by immunoprecipitated phospho-ERK1/2 was detected by a phospho-specific anti-Elk-1 antibody. At time 0 (before incubation in acidic pH medium) a basal level of phosphorylated Elk-1 was detected; a significant induction in the level of phosphorylated Elk-1 was detected 15 min after incubation in acidic pH medium (Fig. 7), indicating phosphorylation of ERK1/2 is accompanied by its functional activation. To further confirm that the ERK pathway is involved in the acidic pH-induced VEGF expression, we tested whether the induction of VEGF transcripts was inhibited by the MEK1 inhibitors, PD98059 and U0126. Northern blot analysis showed that the induction of VEGF mRNA by acidic pH was decreased by treatment with the MEK1 inhibitors (Fig. 8). These results further confirmed that ERK MAPK is required in acidic pH up-regulation of VEGF. Finally, we demonstrated that Ras and Raf promoted the VEGFtranscriptional activation in human glioblastoma cells. U87 MG cells were co-transfected with the full-length VEGF promoter-luciferase, pRL-TK, and plasmid containing RasV12 (constitutively active form of the Ras) or RasN17 (dominant negative form of the Ras) or RafCAAX (constitutively active Raf) or RafS621A (dominant negative form of the Raf). Cells transfected with only VEGF-luc and pRL-TK were used as control. VEGF promoter activity was increased up to 3-fold under acidic pH condition. With the transfection of constitutively activated Ras or Raf, the induction of VEGF promoter activity by acidic pH increased to 4- to 5-fold, whereas transfection of a plasmid that expresses the dominant negative form of Ras and Raf completely abolished the induction of VEGF promoter activity by acidic pH (Fig. 9), suggesting that Ras and Raf are critical for mediating VEGF transcriptional activation by acidic pH. Many recent studies showed that the factors most influential in the control of the expression of VEGF are those associated with tumor microenvironmental conditions. Because glioblastomas commonly overexpress VEGF and have a low extracellular pH of 6.78–6.93 (14.Wike-Hooley J.L. Haveman J. Reinhold H.S. Radiother. Oncol. 1984; 2: 343-366Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (805) Google Scholar), they provide an ideal system for examining the mechanisms that up-regulate VEGF by the host microenvironment. We established a link between tumor acidic pH and VEGF up-regulation in U87 MG human glioma cells. Acidic pH has been shown to up-regulate VEGF and basic fibroblast growth factor expression in human endothelial cells (29.D'Arcangelo D. Facchiano F. Barlucchi L.M. Melillo G. Illi B. Testolin L. Gaetano C. Capogrossi M.C. Circ. Res. 2000; 86: 312-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) and various tumor cells (15.Fukumura D. Xu L. Chen Y. Gohongi T. Seed B. Jain R.K. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 6020-6024PubMed Google Scholar, 30.Shi Q. Le X. Wang B. Abbruzzese J.L. Xiong Q. He Y. Xie K. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 3751-3756Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar), as well as interleukin-8 expression in human ovarian carcinoma cells (31.Xu L. Fidler I.J. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 4610-4616PubMed Google Scholar) and in human pancreatic cancer cells (32.Shi Q. Le X. Wang B. Xiong Q. Abbruzzese J.L. Xie K. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 2000; 20: 1023-1028Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). On the other hand, some studies also show that acidic pH decreases the expression of VEGF and extracellular matrix proteins gene expression in mouse osteoblasts (33.Spector A. Zhou W. Ma W. Chignell C.F. Reszka K.J. Exp. Eye Res. 2000; 71: 183-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 34.Frick K.K. Bushinsky D.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: F840-F847Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It has been suggested that the lower pH and decreased VEGF production serve to regulate osteogenesis negatively in areas that first require resorption by resident osteoclasts (33.Spector A. Zhou W. Ma W. Chignell C.F. Reszka K.J. Exp. Eye Res. 2000; 71: 183-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that variable responses of different cells to the same stimuli are relevant to different biological functions. In solid tumors, which often have insufficient blood flow, an effective means of overcoming the limitations of poor perfusion is to up-regulate VEGF and stimulate the angiogenic response. To better define the signaling pathway leading to the transcriptional activation of the VEGF promoter by acidic pH, we used reporter gene analysis with serial deletion constructs of the VEGF promoter. The human VEGF promoter contains sequences corresponding to the HIF-1 binding site, 5′-TACGTGGG (−975 to −968 bp), which has been shown to be essential for VEGF induction by hypoxia (35.Forsythe J.A. Jiang B.H. Iyer N.V. Agani F. Leung S.W. Koos R.D. Semenza G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4604-4613Crossref PubMed Scopus (3135) Google Scholar). It contains the AP-1 binding site, 5′-TGACTAA (−937 to −931 bp), which has been shown to also be involved in hypoxic induction of VEGF in glioma cells (36.Damert A. Ikeda E. Risau W. Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 419-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). It also contains AP-2 and Sp-1 binding sites located in the promoter region −85 to −50 bp that confers responsiveness to transforming growth factor-α, interleukin-1β, and platelet-derived growth factor (37.Tischer E.

Oncogene. 1997; 15: 669-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Our deletional analysis of the VEGF promoter showed that deletion of the region containing the AP-1 binding site abolished the activation of VEGF promoter by acidosis. However, whether this region also contains a specific pH response element different from the AP-1 binding site is not known, and further deletion within this region is required. We observed that the DNA binding activity of AP-1 is induced in acidosis. With the use of specific antibodies, we showed that c-Fos and JunD members of the AP-1 family are components of the complex that was induced by acidic pH. AP-1 is known to potentiate the HIF-1-mediated hypoxia-induced transcriptional activation of VEGF in C6 glioma cells (36.Damert A. Ikeda E. Risau W. Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 419-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). It also mediates the induction of VEGF expression by hypoglycemia in human hepatoblastoma cells (41.Park S.H. Kim K.W. Lee Y.S. Baek J.H. Kim M.S. Lee Y.M. Lee M.S. Kim Y.J. Int. J. Mol. Med. 2001; 7: 91-96PubMed Google Scholar) and by ionizing radiation in human glioblastoma cells (42.Mori K. Tani M. Kamata K. Kawamura H. Urata Y. Goto S. Kuwano M. Shibata S. Kondo T. Free Radic. Res. 2000; 33: 157-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The increase in AP-1 activity in response to stimuli, such as UV and tumor necrosis factor-α, could be due to increased Jun and c-Fos synthesis and phosphorylation. We are presently investigating whether this increased binding affinity is regulated by phosphorylation or mediated by an increase in the amounts of both factors. ERK1/2 MAPK phosphorylates proteins from the plasma membrane to the nucleus (43.Moriguchi T. Gotoh Y. Nishida E. Adv. Pharmacol. 1996; 36: 121-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In unstimulated cells, ERK1/2 are largely cytoplasmic and relocalize to the nucleus upon stimulation (44.Lenormand P. Brondello J.M. Brunet A. Pouyssegur J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 625-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 45.Brunet A. Roux D. Lenormand P. Dowd S. Keyse S. Pouyssegur J.

Cell. 1998; 93: 605-615Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar). The ERK group of MAPKs phosphorylates Elk-1. Elk-1 activates c-Fos, which, upon translocation to the nucleus, combines with pre-existing Jun proteins to form AP-1 dimers that leads to higher levels of AP-1 DNA binding activity (47.Smeal T. Angel P. Meek J. Karin M. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 2091-2100Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 48.Karin M. Hunter T. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 747-757Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar). Most cell types contain some c-Jun protein prior to their stimulation, which is activated by SAPK/JNK phosphorylation (48.Karin M. Hunter T. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 747-757Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar). Our study shows that only ERK MAPK activity is activated in acidic pH conditions, and it translocates to the nucleus to phosphorylate its downstream pathway member, Elk-1. However, ERK MAPK may also activate other transcription factors that contribute to the activation of AP-1 and mediate VEGF induction by acidic pH. The role of ERK MAPK in regulating cell proliferation and promoting cell survival is well defined (49.Bhatt R.R. Ferrell Jr., J.E. Science. 1999; 286: 1362-1365Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 50.Treinies I. Paterson H.F. Hooper S. Wilson R. Marshall C.J. Mol. Cell.

Recent studies show that ERK MAPK is also activated during hypoxia in human endothelial cells (52.Minet E. Arnould T. Michel G. Roland I. Mottet D. Raes M. Remacle J. Michiels C. FEBS Lett. 2000; 468: 53-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar), normal and transformed fibroblasts (16.Pages G. Milanini J. Richard D.E. Berra E. Gothie E. Vinals F. Pouyssegur J. Ann. N. Y.

J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23435-23439Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Our results are in agreement with these studies suggesting that the functions of ERK MAPK are not limited to cell proliferation and survival but are also involved in cellular response to extracellular stress. Phosphorylated p38 MAPK and JNK/SAPK were undetectable by Western blot in our study. However, our results suggest that, even with the inhibition of ERK1/2 MAPK, VEGF mRNA up-regulation by acidic pH was not completely inhibited. These results indicate that other signaling pathways may also contribute to the VEGF induction. Ras mediates Raf activation and, thus, initiates MAPK activation. This leads to an increase in the expression of c-Jun and c-Fos and therefore to an increased AP-1 activity (55.Grugel S. Finkenzeller G. Weindel K. Barleon B. Marme D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25915-25919Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). The expression and secretion of VEGF are induced by activated oncogenes such as ras and raf (56.Jiang B.H. Agani F. Passaniti A. Semenza G.L. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 5328-5335PubMed Google Scholar, 57.Kerbel R.S. Viloria-Petit A. Okada F. Rak J. Mol. Med. 1998; 4: 286-295Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Ras and Raf activation has also been shown to be involved with hypoxia in up-regulating VEGF (55.Grugel S. Finkenzeller G. Weindel K. Barleon B. Marme D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25915-25919Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). We analyzed the effect of the dominant negative form of Ras and Raf on the induction of VEGF by acidic pH. Our results showed that dominant negative forms of Ras and Raf abolished the acidic pH-induced VEGFtranscriptional activation. Several studies have shown that the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt signaling pathway mediates hypoxia-induced VEGF expression in ras-transformed cells (58.Mazure N.M. Chen E.Y. Laderoute K.R. Giaccia A.J. Blood. 1997; 90: 3322-3331Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Whether phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt is involved in acidic pH signal transduction and what are the roles of other signaling pathways are currently under investigation. Our results have strong implications in our understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms involved in the acquisition of the angiogenic phenotype. The data presented here provide evidence that acidic pH activates VEGF gene transcription. The transcriptional activation of VEGF gene is mediated by AP-1 and requires the ERK MAPK. There is now urgent need to decipher how the acidic pH signal is sensed by the cells and which transduction pathways are implicated in VEGF induction.

https://openalex.org/W2037131341,"Abnormal high density lipoprotein metabolism may contribute to the increased atherosclerosis associated with diabetes and insulin resistance. The ATP-binding cassette transporter ABCA1 mediates cholesterol transport from tissue macrophages to apoA-I, the major high density lipoprotein protein component. Because fatty acids are elevated in diabetes, we examined the effects of fatty acids on ABCA1 activity in cultured macrophages. Results showed that unsaturated fatty acids markedly inhibited ABCA1-mediated cholesterol and phospholipid efflux from macrophages when ABCA1 was induced by a cAMP analog. This was accompanied by a reduction in the membrane content of ABCA1 and a decrease in apoA-I binding to whole cells and to ABCA1. In contrast, saturated fatty acids had no effect on these processes. Fatty acids did not alter ABCA1 mRNA abundance or incorporation of methionine into ABCA1, indicating that decreased <i>ABCA1</i>transcription, enhanced mRNA decay, or impaired translation efficiency did not account for these inhibitory effects. Unsaturated fatty acids, however, increased ABCA1 turnover when protein synthesis was blocked by cycloheximide. We conclude that unsaturated fatty acids reduce the macrophage ABCA1 content by enhancing its degradation rate. These findings raise the possibility that an increased supply of unsaturated fatty acids in the artery wall promotes atherogenesis by impairing the ABCA1 cholesterol secretory pathway in macrophages."

To determine whether CYPOR is an essential enzyme in the mouse and the sole electron donor to the cytochromes P450, we have examined the effects of CYPOR gene disruption by removal of the natural translation initiation site and deletion of the membrane-binding domain of CYPOR. Although homozygous CYPOR −/− embryos produced a truncated, cytoplasmic protein, microsomal CYPOR was absent and a spectrum of embryonic defects leading to mid-gestational lethality was observed, demonstrating that microsomal CYPOR is indeed necessary for normal embryonic development.

These primers produce an 8-kbp product with the wild-type allele, which is decreased to 7.3 kbp upon homologous recombination (Fig. 1 B). Clones producing both bands were classified as heterozygous for the targeted allele; this was confirmed by EcoRV digestion of the PCR products to give the expected 4.0- and 2.5-kbp bands, with the 4.0-kbp band hybridizing, as expected, to an intron 1 probe. Positive clones were expanded and karyotyped before injection into blastocysts and implantation into pseudopregnant C57BL6 females. Chimeric males were mated with C57/BL6 females to yield heterozygous F1 progeny, which were then mated with each other to produce CYPOR +/+, +/−, and −/− offspring. Mouse tail DNA was isolated using the Qiagen DNeasy kit and analyzed using two separate PCR reactions (Fig. 1 B). The first employed the primers intron 1C and Common 1 (5′-TCTGAGGGCACCACTCACGTTGT-3′), shown in Fig. 1 A, which yielded bands of 4.7 kbp and 4.0 kb, respectively, for the wild-type and disrupted alleles. A second, confirmatory, reaction, yielding 210- and 260-bp fragments, respectively, for the wild-type and disrupted alleles, employed three primers: Common 1, which spans the exon 2/intron 2 junction and is found in both the wild-type and disrupted alleles, WT1 (5′-GTGTCACCAACATGGGGGACTCT-3′), located in the deleted segment of intron 1 and found only in the wild-type allele, and Neo4 (5′-CTTCCATTTGTCACGTCCTGCAC-3′), located in the Neogene of the disrupted allele (Fig. 1 A). Detection of vaginal plugs in the morning was taken as gestation day 0.5 (E0.5). Embryos were genotyped by removal of either the tail or the hind limb bud prior to fixation. For histology, embryos were fixed for at least 4 h in 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline, dehydrated, and embedded in paraffin. Ten-micron sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (23Seidman J.G. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Wiley Interscience, New York1994: 14.0.1-14.6.8Google Scholar). For scanning electron microscopy, embryos were fixed in Karnovsky's buffer, postfixed in osmium tetroxide, dehydrated, critical point-dried, coated with gold-palladium, and viewed on a Hitachi S-570 scanning electron microscope. For preparation of embryonic S1 and microsomal fractions, whole embryos were homogenized in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.7, 0.15 m KCl, 1 mm EDTA, containing 100 μmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin and centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 30 min. This low speed supernatant fraction, designated S1, was centrifuged at 100,000 ×g for 60 min, and the microsomal pellet was resuspended in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.7, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, 20% glycerol. Protein was determined using the BCA Protein Assay kit (Pierce). Western blotting was carried out using a polyclonal anti-rat CYPOR antibody, with ECL detection using the BM Chemiluminescence Western blotting kit from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. EROD and cytochrome c reductase activities were measured as described previously (24Shen A.L. Porter T.D. Wilson T.E. Kasper C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 7584-7589Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Burke M.D. Thompson S. Elcombe C.R. Halpert J. Haaparanta T. Mayer R.T. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1985; 34: 3337-3345Crossref PubMed Scopus (1336) Google Scholar). Cytochrome creductase assays contained 23–50 (liver) or 10–30 (embryonic) μg of microsomal protein. EROD assays contained 100–200 (liver) or 50–100 (embryonic) μg of microsomal protein. Limits of detection were ≤0.001 μmol/min/mg of protein for cytochrome c and ≤ 0.02 pmol/min/mg of protein for EROD activity. Homologous recombination between the targeting construct and the mouse CYPOR gene deleted 2.5 kbp of the 3′-end of intron 1 and all but the last six bases of exon 2 (Fig.1 A), thus removing both the translation start site and the membrane-binding domain necessary for electron transfer to cytochrome P450 (20Porter T.D. Beck T.W. Kasper C.B. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 9814-9818Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Two separate clones, designated G1 and H11, yielded chimeras that subsequently transmitted the disrupted allele to their progeny. Mice analyzed in this study were obtained from five founder males, four derived from the G1 clone and one from H11, and were maintained on a mixed 129SvJ/C57/BL6 background. No differences were noted among the progeny of the five founders. Heterozygote crosses produced an average litter size of 6 ± 2, with a normal male: female ratio (0.52) and no apparent perinatal mortality. Genotyping of 2-week-old offspring of heterozygote crosses yielded no homozygous −/− offspring (TableI). Heterozygotes were obtained at a frequency of 56% (Table I), significantly less (p < 0.05) than the 67% expected for a 1:2 wild-type:heterozygote ratio, suggesting that loss of one CYPOR allele reduced survival. Genotyping of E8.5 to E10.5 embryos from heterozygote crosses produced the expected 1:2:1 Mendelian ratios; however, the frequency of homozygotes declined thereafter and no homozygous embryos were observed after E13.5. Genotyping of late gestational age embryos also revealed a deficiency of heterozygous embryos, suggesting an increased mortality of +/− embryos.Table IObserved genotypes from CYPOR +/− crossesGestational ageGenotype1-aEmbryos derived from clone G1 or pups derived from clones G1 or H11 were genotyped as described under “Materials and Methods” and expressed as a percentage of the total.

Open table in a new tab Examination of the gross morphology of the embryos revealed a spectrum of abnormalities in the CYPOR −/− embryos (Fig.2). Although E8.5 and E9.5 −/− embryos were generally indistinguishable from +/+ and +/− embryos, older CYPOR −/− embryos were noticeably more friable than their littermates. At E10.5 and E11.5, 90% of CYPOR −/− embryos (compared with 22% of +/− and 12% of +/+ embryos) displayed abnormalities visible by light microscopy. These CYPOR −/− embryos could be divided into two classes, with Type I embryos being relatively well-developed but displaying neural tube, cardiac, eye, and limb bud abnormalities (Fig.2 B), and Type II embryos exhibiting a generalized retardation of development (Fig. 2 C). At E10.5, somite formation was grossly normal in CYPOR −/− Type I embryos (Fig. 2 B). Fore and hind limb buds were present and well-formed; however, neural tube abnormalities were evident. Fig.2 A displays normal neural, tail, and limb development in an E10.5 CYPOR wild-type embryo. In contrast, its CYPOR −/− littermate (Fig. 2 B) exhibited an exencephalic phenotype, with failure of neural fold elevation, subsequent failure of dorsal fusion, and eversion of the neural tube in the hindbrain and midbrain region giving a “ruffled” appearance to the head. Other gross abnormalities include a fluid-filled dilated pericardial cavity (Fig.2, B and C), alteration in the size and positioning of the branchial arches relative to the fronto-nasal region (Fig. 2 A versus 2B) as well as truncation of the tail (Fig. 2 B). Petechial hemorrhaging was noted in the CYPOR −/− embryos and was particularly prominent at the edges of the hindbrain neural folds (Fig. 2 B). Failure of the caudal neuropore to close was also observed (not shown). Examples of a more severe, generalized retardation of development, the Type II phenotype, are presented in Fig. 2 C. Although the majority of E10.5 Type II −/− embryos were turned, they were, in comparison with wild-type littermates, poorly developed and small (Fig.2 C). These embryos displayed an observable heartbeat despite obvious pericardial edema. Fore and hind limb formation, as well as cranial development, were delayed. Finally, −/− embryos with an apparently normal yolk sac but no recognizable embryonic structures, were also isolated (Fig. 2 C). Scanning electron microscopy of the Type I CYPOR −/− embryos provided a detailed view of the neural tube defects (Fig.3). By E10.5, the neural tube was completely closed in the wild-type embryo (Fig. 3 A). Fig.3 B displays the predominant pattern of neural tube abnormalities in E10.5 −/− embryos. The rostral portion of the forebrain and the posterior neural tube (spinal cord) were closed; however, the region extending from the caudal portion of the forebrain to the rostral end of the hindbrain remained elevated and open. The midbrain neuroepithelium was elevated, with the neural folds assuming a concave position, but not fused. In the hindbrain, the neural folds remained in a convex position despite continued proliferation of the neuroepithelium. Alternate patterns were also observed; Fig.3 C shows a Type I embryo where the cranial portion of the neural tube was closed, but the hindbrain neural folds failed to elevate and fuse. Malformation of the branchial arches and eye abnormalities were apparent in these embryos, as well as a rough surface, consistent with the observed increased friability, and suggesting defects in cell adhesion properties and/or membrane structure (Fig. 3, B and C). No Type II embryos remained intact through the fixation process. Histological examination of the homozygous null embryos also demonstrates the convex position and lack of elevation of the neural folds in the Type I CYPOR −/− embryo (compare Fig.4 A and 4 B). As was observed in the intact embryo, red blood cells were present in the region of the neural folds (Fig. 4, B and C). Numerous cells containing pyknotic nuclei were also detected in the CYPOR −/− embryo adjacent to the fronto-nasal midline (Fig.4 D), consistent with apoptosis. Apoptosis was also noted in the apical epidermal ridges of the limb bud (not shown), although the fore and hind limb buds were well-formed overall. Significantly, no evidence of necrosis was observed in the CYPOR −/− embryos. Concomitant with enlargement of the pericardial cavity (Fig.2 B), Type I CYPOR −/− embryos also displayed histological evidence of defective heart development. Fig.5 displays histological sections from the cardiac region of E11.5 wild-type (A and C) and −/− (B and D) embryos. Although development of the atrioventricular cushion (Fig. 5, A versus B) and positioning of the atrium and ventricle (Fig. 5,C versus D) were normal in the CYPOR −/− embryo, development of the outflow tract and ventricle was impaired. Within the outflow tract, the wild-type embryo showed an increase in mesenchyme destined to differentiate to form the spiral septum, whereas, little evidence of mesenchyme proliferation was noted in the null embryo (Fig. 5, A versus D). In the ventricle, the CYPOR −/− embryo exhibited a marked reduction in the development of trabeculae (Fig. 5, C versus D, arrowheads). Alterations were also noted in the myocardial wall, with the CYPOR−/− embryo inpanel D displaying a thin myocardium compared with its wild-type littermate (Fig. 5 C), whereas a thickened myocardial wall was observed in other −/− embryos (not shown). Western blot analysis of both S1 and microsome fractions from CYPOR +/+ embryos demonstrated, as expected, a single immunoreactive 78-kDa protein, which was absent in E10.5 CYPOR −/− Type I embryos, consistent with deletion of the wild-type translation start site (Fig.6). However, the −/− embryos contained a new immunoreactive protein with an apparent molecular mass of 66 kDa, found in the S1 fraction but not in microsomes. Although both proteins were found in the S1 fraction of CYPOR +/− embryos, only the 78-kDa protein was found in heterozygote microsomes. Cytochrome c reductase activity in liver microsomes isolated from adult heterozygous mice was ∼50% that found in wild-type microsomes (Table II), whereas EROD activity was decreased to 77% of wild-type. Cytochrome creductase activity in microsomes prepared from either wild-type or heterozygous embryos (E11.5) was ∼10% that of adult liver microsomes and was undetectable in microsomes isolated from Type I CYPOR −/− embryos. EROD activity was also undetectable in embryonic CYPOR −/− microsomes (Table II).Table IIAdult and embryonic microsomal CYPOR-dependent catalytic activitiesSpecific activityAdultEmbryo+/++/−+/++/−−/−Cytochrome c(μmol/min/mg protein)0.34 ± 0.02 (4)0.17 ± 0.03 (4)0.02 ± 0.008 (3)0.02 ± 0.008 (3)ND2-aND, not detectable.(2)EROD (pmol/min/mg protein)22.2 ± 2.0 (4)16.9 ± 2.5 (4)0.12 ± 0.06 (3)0.12 ± 0.02 (3)ND (2)Microsomes were prepared from livers of 4-month-old mice or from E11.5 embryos isolated from a single dam.

(number of animals/embryos). Absence of microsomal CYPOR leads to embryonic lethality, with a variety of embryonic defects observable by day 10.5 of gestation. CYPOR −/− embryos displayed a marked friability and apparent generalized defects in cell adhesion. The remaining defects could be divided into two independent classes: Type I, displaying neural tube, cardiac, eye, and limb abnormalities, and Type II, exhibiting a generalized retardation of development after approximately E8.5. These results confirm the critical role of CYPOR in embryonic development and are consistent with the report that RNA-mediated interference of CYPOR expression in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans produces embryonic lethality and undefined structural abnormalities (26Gonczy P. Echeverri G. Oegema K. Coulson A. Jones S.J. Copley R.R. Duperon J. Oegema J. Brehm M. Cassin E. Hannak E. Kirkham M. Pichler S. Flohrs K. Goessen A. Leidel S. Alleaume A.M. Martin C. Ozlu N. Bork P. Hyman A.A. Nature. 2000; 408: 331-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (738) Google Scholar). Although yeast are able to survive in the absence of CYPOR, with cytochrome b 5 serving as an alternate electron donor to the cytochromes P450 (9Truan G. Epinat J.C. Rougeulle C. Cullin C. Pompon D. Gene. 1994; 142: 123-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 10Lamb D.C. Kelly D.E. Manning N.J. Kaderbhai M.A. Kelly S.L. FEBS Lett. 1999; 462: 283-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), it is clear that the functions of CYPOR are essential in higher organisms. Although the authentic CYPOR translation initiation site has been deleted in the disrupted allele, the presence of a 66-kDa protein in heterozygous and Type I homozygous embryos indicates that translation must have initiated at an alternate start site. Analysis by 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends of mRNA from CYPOR +/− embryos (not shown) reveals, in addition to the wild-type transcript, an alternative transcript containing exon 1 spliced to exon 3. Exon 3 contains two potential translation initiation sites, with initiation at the ATG at position 107 of the wild-type protein producing a protein of 65 kDa, remarkably similar to the size observed. This protein would retain binding sites for the isoalloxazine, but not the phosphate, of FMN, as well as the FAD and NADPH domains (27Shen A.L. Kasper C.B Schenkman J.B. Greim H. Handbook of Experimental Pharmacology. Springer, New York1993: 35-59Google Scholar). The absence of the membrane-binding domain, essential for formation of a productive catalytic complex with cytochrome P450 (6Black S.D. French J.S. Williams C.H., Jr. Coon M.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1979; 91: 1528-1535Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), and its cytoplasmic localization argues against the ability of the 66-kDa protein to support microsomal P450 activities. Although it is not known which CYPOR-dependent activities are essential for embryonic development, detection of CYPOR transcripts in two-cell mouse embryos suggests an essential role in the early stages of embryogenesis (The Institute for Genomic Research Mouse Gene Index, version 5.0). The question remains as to whether the survival of CYPOR −/− embryos to as late as E13.5 is the result of residual activity of the cytoplasmic protein or some other compensatory activity. Possible compensatory mechanisms include both the presence of an alternate electron donor, which substitutes for the electron transfer functions of CYPOR such as adrenodoxin/adrenodoxin reductase (28Anandatheerthavarada H.K. Amuthan G. Biswas G. Robin M.A. Murali R. Waterman M.R. Avadhani N.G. EMBO J. 2001; 15: 2394-2403Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar) or cytochrome b 5 (9Truan G. Epinat J.C. Rougeulle C. Cullin C. Pompon D. Gene. 1994; 142: 123-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 10Lamb D.C. Kelly D.E. Manning N.J. Kaderbhai M.A. Kelly S.L. FEBS Lett. 1999; 462: 283-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), or alternate sources of metabolites produced by CYPOR-dependent enzymes, for example, maternal sources of cholesterol (29Moebius F.F. Fitzky B.U. Glossmann H. Trends Endocrinol. Metabol. 2000; 11: 106-114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Regardless of the source, these pathways are insufficient to support normal embryonic development beyond mid-gestation. CYPOR is a key participant in a variety of metabolic pathways as a consequence of its interactions with the cytochromes P450, heme oxygenase, squalene monooxygenase, and cytochromeb 5. The heterogeneity of the observed CYPOR −/− phenotypes may be a reflection of these multiple biochemical pathways involving CYPOR as well as multiple compensatory mechanisms. Further studies are in progress to characterize these phenotypes and their transmission patterns. CYPOR, alone or via interactions with other proteins, mediates the synthesis and/or degradation of several cellular regulatory factors, with two significant examples being retinoic acid and cholesterol. Teratogenicity has been associated with retinoic acid excess as well as deficiency, with major targets being the craniofacial region, heart, skeleton, limbs, eye, and central nervous system (30Ross S.A. McCaffery P.J. Drager U.C. De Luca L.M. Physiol. Rev. 2000; 80: 1021-1054Crossref PubMed Scopus (744) Google Scholar). Several catabolic pathways, including those mediated by CYP26A1, catalyze spatially and temporally regulated breakdown of retinoic acid (12Fujii H. Sato T. Kaneko S. Gotoh O. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. Osawa K. Kato S. Hamada H. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4163-4173Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar, 13White J.A. Ramshaw H. Taimi M. Stangle W. Zhang A. Everingham S. Creighton S. Tam S.-H. Jones G. Petkovich M. Proc. Natl. Acid. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6403-6408Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Although CYP26A1 knockouts are lethal between E9.5 and birth and display some phenotypes in common with the CYPOR knockout, including exencephaly and arrested development, the predominant phenotypes, caudal truncations and vertebrate transformations, differ from those observed here (31Sakai Y.

Chambon P. Petkovich M. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 226-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). Cholesterol, in addition to being an essential component of eucaryotic cell membranes, has been recently shown to be necessary for activity of the sonic hedgehog protein, a mediator of patterning in the vertebrate embryo (33Porter J.A. Young K.E. Beachey P.A. Science. 1996; 274: 255-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (1114) Google Scholar). CYPOR is required at two points in the biosynthesis of cholesterol: squalene monooxygenase catalyzes formation of squalene-2,3-epoxide (5Ono T. Bloch K. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 1571-1579Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) whereas CYP51 catalyzes lanosterol demethylation (11Stromstedt M. Rozman D. Waterman M.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 329: 73-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). The structural defects and increased friability observed in the CYPOR −/− embryos are consistent with defects in cholesterol biosynthesis and are reminiscent of those observed in a human genetic disorder of cholesterol biosynthesis, desmosterolosis (29Moebius F.F. Fitzky B.U. Glossmann H. Trends Endocrinol. Metabol. 2000; 11: 106-114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Defective neural tube closure and developmental delay have been observed in a knockout of another enzyme involved in cholesterol biosynthesis, squalene synthase; however, lethality in these mice occurred somewhat earlier (E9.5) (34Tozawa R. Ishibashi S. Osuga J. Yagyu H. Oka T. Chen Z. Ohashi K. Perrey S. Shionoiri F. Yahagi N. Harada K. Gotoda T. Yazaki Y. Yamada N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30843-30848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). In view of the redundancy observed in many cellular functions, it is surprising that there is not an efficient alternative electron donor to the cytochromes P450. Although evolutionarily ancient and present in multiple copies in plants (8Benveniste I. Lesot A. Hasenfratz M.P. Kochs G. Durst F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 177: 105-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), CYPOR has been shown to exist as a single-copy gene in the mouse (19Simmons D.L. Lalley P.A. Kasper C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 260: 515-521Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). This situation may be different in primates, including humans, where CYPOR has been localized to a region of chromosome 7 that is duplicated (18Peoples R. Franke Y. Wang Y.K. Perez-Jurado L. Paperna T. Cisco M. Francke U. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2000; 66: 47-68Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar); this may provide a means to ensure against the catastrophic consequences of CYPOR deletion.

https://openalex.org/W2016624004,"The behaviour of electrons in solids is remarkably well described by Landau's Fermi-liquid theory, which says that even though electrons in a metal interact they can still be treated as well-defined fermions, called ``quasiparticles''. At low temperature, the ability of quasiparticles to transport heat is strictly given by their ability to transport charge, via a universal relation known as the Wiedemann-Franz law, which no material in nature has been known to violate. High-temperature superconductors have long been thought to fall outside the realm of Fermi-liquid theory, as suggested by several anomalous properties, but this has yet to be shown conclusively. Here we report on the first experimental test of the Wiedemann-Franz law in a cuprate superconductor, (Pr,Ce)$_2$CuO$_4$. Our study reveals a clear departure from the universal law and provides compelling evidence for the breakdown of Fermi-liquid theory in high-temperature superconductors."

Rupture of fetal membranes at term as well as preterm has been attributed, in part, to degradation of the collagens in the extracellular matrix. The breakdown of the interstitial collagens is mediated by matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). The first step in interstitial collagen catabolism is catalyzed by collagenases including matrix metalloproteinase 1 (MMP-1), the primary collagenase elaborated by fibroblasts (6Nagase H. Woessner J.F., Jr. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21491-21494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3884) Google Scholar). It is also produced by monocytic cells (7Pierce R.A. Sandefur S. Doyle G.A. Welgus H.G. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 1890-1899Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). MMP-1 is produced as a proenzyme; after proteolytic activation, it cleaves through the fibrillar triple helix at a specific site, producing fragments that can be further degraded by other MMPs, including the gelatinases MMP-2 and MMP-9 (8Woessner J.F., Jr. Parks W.C.

Evidence that MMP activity is important for fetal membrane rupture includes the observation that fetal membrane MMP expression increases at the time of parturition (13McLaren J. Taylor D.J. Bell S.C.

Moreover, MMP levels are elevated in human amniotic fluid in association with PPROM (15Vadillo-Ortega F. Hernandez A. Gonzalez-Avila G. Bermejo L. Iwata K. Strauss III, J.F. Am. J. Obstet.

A single nucleotide polymorphism at nucleotide −1607 in the MMP-1 promoter in which insertion of a guanine nucleotide (G) creates a core binding site for Ets transcription factors (5′-GGAT-3′) has been reported to increase MMP-1 promoter activity (19Rutter J.L. Mitchell T.I. Buttice G. Meyers J. Gusella J.F. Ozelius L.J. Brinckerhoff C.E. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 5321-5325PubMed Google Scholar). In general, Ets transcription factors cooperate with activator protein-1 (AP-1) to enhance the activity of several MMP promoters. However, this polymorphism has yet to be shown to influence transcription of the endogenous MMP-1 gene and to affect production of MMP-1 protein. Because MMP-1 is the primary collagenase involved in interstitial collagen degradation by mesenchymal cells, and its concentrations in amniotic fluid are increased in association with PPROM (18Maymon E. Romero R. Pacora P. Gervasi M.T. Bianco K. Ghezzi F. Yoon B.H. Am. J. Obstet. Gynecol. 2000; 183: 914-920Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), we investigated whether this insertion/deletion polymorphism in the MMP-1 promoter is functionally significant for MMP-1 expression in amnion cells and whether the polymorphism is associated with PPROM. We show for the first time that the −1607 polymorphism indeed contributes to the regulation of endogenousMMP-1 gene transcription, the level of enzyme produced by mesenchymal cells, and is associated with risk of an obstetrical complication caused by increased catabolism of interstitial collagen. Subjects in this study were offspring of African American women receiving obstetrical care at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, and Hutzel Hospital, Detroit. The study was approved by the respective Institutional Review Boards, and informed consent was obtained from mothers prior to collection of the samples. Controls were derived from singleton pregnancies delivered at term of mothers with no prior history of PPROM or preterm birth. Cases were singleton pregnancies complicated by PPROM, defined as fetal membrane rupture prior to 37 weeks of completed gestation. PPROM was diagnosed by vaginal pooling of fluid and positive nitrazine and fern tests. Pregnancies with fetal malformations or medical complications requiring induction of labor were excluded from both the control and case groups. Cultures of amnion mesenchymal cells were prepared from fetal membranes obtained from patients with term gestations. After separation of the amnion from the chorion, pieces of amnion were minced and then digested with 1 mg/ml collagenase A (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) in 1× Hanks' balanced salt solution (Invitrogen) at 37 °C with gentle shaking for 2 h (20Whittle W.L. Gibb W. Challis J.R. Placenta. 2000; 21: 394-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). After digestion, the suspension was filtered through a 0.28-mm wire mesh, and cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 3,000 rpm for 10 min. The cells were resuspended in 1× Hanks' balanced salt solution and then centrifuged. The cell pellet was resuspended in 3 ml of 1× Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) (Invitrogen) and layered onto a discontinuous Percoll gradient (5/20/40/60%, v/v). The gradient was centrifuged at 1,500 rpm for 20 min. The cells were collected from the interface of the 20–40% layer, washed by centrifugation in DMEM, and then plated in medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Invitrogen). Cells were collected after 7 days of culture and frozen for subsequent use after one passage. Cells cultured after a single passage were fixed with paraformaldehyde (4%) and stained for vimentin (Dako Corporation, Carpinteria, CA) and cytokeratin-18 (Sigma) using Vectastain ABC kit reagents and mouse IgG (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). A2058 melanoma cells were cultured in DMEM, 10% FBS, and 0.1% gentamicin. WISH amnion-derived cells were cultured in Kennett's HY medium (Invitrogen), containing 1× OPI (0.15 mg/ml oxalacetic acid, 50 μg/ml sodium pyruvate, 0.2 unit/ml insulin), 2%l-glutamine, 10 mm HEPES, 2% FBS, and 0.1% gentamicin. Amnion mesenchymal cells were cultured in DMEM, 10% FBS, and 1× Antibiotic-Antimycotic (Invitrogen). Human cervical smooth muscle cells isolated from uteri of nonpregnant women removed for benign disease were purchased from Clonetics (San Diego). The human cervical smooth muscle cells were grown in smooth muscle cell growth medium-2 supplemented with 5% FBS (Clonetics). This medium contains 0.5 ng/ml human epidermal growth factor, 1.0 ng/ml human fibroblast growth factor, 5 μg/ml insulin, 50 μg/ml gentamicin, and 50 μg/ml amphotericin B. All cells were maintained at 37 °C under an atmosphere of 5% CO2 in air. For transfection, 1 × 105 cells were seeded in each well of a 12-well plastic culture plate. Cells were transfected using FuGENETM 6 Transfection Reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) with 0.5 μg of the pGL3 vector containing a −4,372 bp of MMP-1 promoter fragment coupled to firefly luciferase reporter gene. The promoter fragment, which has been described previously, was a generous gift from Drs. Joni L. Rutter and Constance E. Brinckerhoff (Dartmouth Medical School). The sequences of the constructed reporter plasmids containing either the 1G or 2G at the −1607 polymorphism were confirmed by DNA sequence analysis. In each transfection 0.5 μg of pCMV-β-galactosidase plasmid (Promega, Madison, WI) was included to correct for transfection efficiency. During the transfection, cells were cultured in medium supplemented with 1% FBS for 24 h. After 24 h of culture, transfected cells were collected into lysis buffer, and luciferase and β-galactosidase assays were performed using reagent systems purchased from Promega. Relative luciferase units were calculated as the ratio of luciferase light units to β-galactosidase activity. Amnion mesenchymal cells were incubated with 2% dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO) or 50 ng/ml phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) for 24 h, and the nuclear proteins were extracted as described previously (21Andrews N.C. Faller D.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 2499Crossref PubMed Scopus (2211) Google Scholar). The following double-stranded oligonucleotide probes were constructed (19Rutter J.L. Mitchell T.I. Buttice G. Meyers J. Gusella J.F. Ozelius L.J. Brinckerhoff C.E. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 5321-5325PubMed Google Scholar): 1G sense, 5′-AAATAATTAGAAAGATATGACTTATCTCAAATCAA-3′; 2G sense, 5′-AAATAATTAGAAAGGATATGACTTATCTCAAATCAA-3′; −78/−59, AP-1 sense, 5′-AAAGCATGAGTCAGACACCT-3′; an oligonucleotide containing a consensus Ets binding site (indicated in bold), 5′-GGGCTGCTTGAGGAAGTATAAGAAT-3′; and an oligonucleotide with a mutated consensus Ets binding site (bold), 5′-GGGCTGGAGAGAGTATAAGAAT-3′. The double-stranded synthetic oligonucleotides were labeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase (Invitrogen) and [γ32P]ATP. The electrophoretic mobility shift assay binding reaction was carried out in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8), 100 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm EDTA, 1 mm MgCl2, 4% glycerol. Briefly, 15 μg of nuclear protein, 2 × 105 cpm of32P-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotide probe (2 ng), 4 μg of poly(dI·dC) (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) with or without unlabeled competitor probe were incubated in a total volume of 30 μl. Reaction mixtures were incubated at room temperature for 30 min and then subjected to 8% PAGE at 200 V for 2 h. The dried gels were then exposed to x-ray film. Cultures of amnion mesenchymal cells were incubated with 2% Me2SO vehicle or 50 ng/ml PMA in medium supplemented with 1% FBS for 24 h. Total RNA was extracted from the cultures with TRIzoL reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Ten μg of total RNA was separated on 1% agarose-formaldehyde denaturing gels and transferred to nylon membranes (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). Membranes were probed with a radioactively labeled MMP-1 cDNA fragment (22Watari M. Watari H. DiSanto M.E. Chacko S. Shi G.P. Strauss III, J.F. Am. J. Pathol. 1999; 154: 1755-1762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) and subsequently a cDNA encoding human 28 S rRNA. Amnion mesenchymal cells were incubated with 2% Me2SO vehicle or 50 ng/ml PMA for 24 h. Total RNA was extracted from 15 cell cultures with different genotypes with respect to the nucleotide −1607 MMP-1 promoter polymorphism (four 1G/1G homozygotes; eight 1G/2G heterozygotes, and three 2G/2G homozygotes) using TRIzoL reagent. Five μg of total RNA was reverse transcribed to single-stranded cDNA using 25 ng/μl oligo(dT)15primer (Promega), 1 unit/μl RNase inhibitor from human placenta (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), and 10 units/μl Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Promega) as described by the manufacturer. Quantitative real-time PCR was performed to assess the induction of MMP-1 mRNA in mesenchymal cells with different −1607 MMP-1 promoter genotypes in response to 50 ng/ml PMA. Primers for the analysis of the human MMP-1 mRNA were designed with the Primer Express software package that accompanies the Applied Biosystems 7700 sequence detector (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The forward and reverse primers were designed to span the fourth intron: forward, 5′-AGATGAAAGGTGGACCAACAATTT-3′; and reverse, 5′-CCAAGAGAATGGCCGAGTTC-3′. The real-time PCR used a 90 nm concentration of each primer and 12.5 μl of SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems). Analysis of the PCR products revealed the presence of a single 78-bp PCR product. To account for differences in starting material, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) mRNA was quantified using primers and probe from Applied Biosystems as described by the manufacturer. The target and GAPDH PCRs were performed in separate tubes in triplicate, and the average threshold cycle for the triplicates was used in all subsequent calculations. To assess transcription of the MMP-1 gene we quantified MMP-1 nascent transcripts using primers that detected intronic sequences. To limit the possibility of detection of genomic DNA, 5 μg of total RNA was treated with RQ1 RNase-free DNase (Promega) for 30 min at 37 °C before reverse transcription with Moloney murine leukemia virus. For the human MMP-1 and human GAPDH nascent transcripts, reverse primers were designed in the eighth and third introns, respectively: MMP-1, 5′-GCCCTAACATTCTCTGCACT-3′; GAPDH, 5′-TAGTTGCCTCCCCAAAGCAC-3′. The resulting cDNA was diluted 10-fold in sterile water, and aliquots were subjected to quantitative real time PCR. The forward and reverse primers for MMP-1 were designed in eighth exon: forward, 5′-ACGGATACCCCAAGGACATCT-3′; reverse; 5′-CTCAGAAAGAGCAGCATCGATATG-3′. For the GAPDH nascent transcripts, primers were designed in the third exon: forward, 5′-GATTCCACCCATGGCAAATT-3′; reverse, 5′-AAGATGGTGATGGGATTTCCATT-3′. Optimization of the PCR indicated that a 90 nm concentration of each primer should be used in each 25-μl reaction to eliminate primer dimer formation. Analysis of PCR products indicated the presence of a single product for both MMP-1 (77 bp) and GAPDH (83 bp). Amnion mesenchymal cells (1 × 105 cells/well) were seeded into six-well plastic culture plates and cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS to 90% confluence. Cells were then incubated with 2% Me2SO vehicle or 50 ng/ml PMA in DMEM supplemented with 1% FBS for 24 h. Conditioned medium was then collected and analyzed for MMP-1 by Western blotting (22Watari M. Watari H. DiSanto M.E. Chacko S. Shi G.P. Strauss III, J.F. Am. J. Pathol. 1999; 154: 1755-1762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) and ELISA (Oncogene Research Products, Boston) as described by the manufacturer. The ELISA detects both pro-MMP-1 and activated MMP-1. DNA was extracted from cultured cells and umbilical cords, cheek swabs, or umbilical blood samples from African American newborns from singleton pregnancies complicated by PPROM and newborns from singleton pregnancies delivered at term. DNA from cultured cells and from umbilical cords was isolated by digestion with proteinase K and extraction with phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (23Strauss W.M. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Smith J.A. Seidman J.G. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Wiley Interscience, New York1994: 2.2.1-2.2.3Google Scholar). DNA from cheek swabs was isolated in 50 mm NaOH and 1 m Tris (pH 8.0). DNA from blood samples was extracted using QIAamp® DNA Mini Kits (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) as described by the manufacturer. The extracted genomic DNA was stored at −70 °C for subsequent use. We employed two different methods to genotype the nucleotide −1607 MMP-1 promoter polymorphism. Primers that flank the insertion/deletion polymorphism in the MMP-1 promoter used for PCR were: forward primer, bp −1650 to −1631, 5′- FAM-GTTATGCCACTTAGATGAGG; and reverse primer, bp −1522 to −1503, 5′-TTCCTCCCCTTATGGATTCC-3′. PCR was performed in a 50-μl reaction volume containing 100 ng of genomic DNA, 25 pmol of each primer, 0.2 mm dNTPs, 1 × reaction buffer, and 2.5 units ofPfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene). The PCRs were performed in a 9600 Gene Amp PCR thermal cycler (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) in 35 cycles (5 min at 94 °C, 1 min at 94 °C, 1 min at 55 °C, 1 min at 68 °C, followed by a 7-min extension at 72 °C). PCR products were electrophoresed in the presence of an internal size standard (Genescan 500) on 4% acrylamide, 5 m urea denaturing gels using a 377 DNA sequencer (PE Applied Biosystems). Gels were run for 2.5 h at 3,000 V. Genotypes were determined using the Genescan Analysis and Genotyper programs (PE Applied Biosystems). The sequences of PCR primers were: forward primer, bp −1695 to −1675, 5′-TGCTGAGAATGTCTTCCCATT-3′; and reverse primer, bp −1578 to −1606, 5′-TCTTGGATTGATTTGAGATAAGTGAAATC-3′. Two mismatches were introduced in the reverse primer so that a XmnI restriction site was present in the 1G amplicon (24Dunleavey L. Beyzade S. Ye S. Matrix Biol. 2000; 19: 175-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). PCR was performed in a 50-μl reaction volume containing 50 ng of genomic DNA, 25 pmol of each primer, 0.2 mm dNTPs, 1 × reaction buffer, 1.5 mm MgCl2 and 1 unit of Taqpolymerase (Invitrogen). The PCR was performed in 35 cycles (5 min at 94 °C, 1 min at 94 °C, 1 min at 57 °C, 1 min at 72 °C, followed by a 7-min extension at 72 °C). A 20-μl aliquot of PCR products was digested with XmnI at 37 °C for 3 h. A 20-μl aliquot of the digest was electrophoresed on a 10% vertical nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel at 150 V for 1 h. The gel was then stained with Vistra Green (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) and scanned with a fluorimager. The confidence intervals for the activity of MMP-1 promoter-reporter constructs were calculated (25Pagano M. Gauvreau K. Principles of Biostatistics. Duxbury Press, Belmont, CA1992: 323-325Google Scholar). The differences among cells with different genotypes with respect to MMP-1 RNA and protein expression were analyzed using the Mann-Whitney U test. Student's t test was used to assess significant differences in demographic characteristics among subjects in the case control study. The chi square test was used to determine the significance of the association between MMP-1 promoter alleles and PPROM. The odds ratio and 95% confidence intervals were also determined. Virtually all of the isolated amnion mesenchymal cells stained positive for vimentin after one passage, whereas only few cells stained for cytokeratin (Fig. 1,A–C). Greater than 95% of cells were vimentin-positive and cytokeratin-negative in the analysis of different isolates. These observations indicate that the preparations used in our experiments were highly enriched for cells from the mesenchymal lineage. We examined the activities of the two promoter alleles transfected into various cell hosts. The relative promoter activities of the 2G allele to the 1G allele are shown in TableI. Consistent with the report of Rutteret al. (19Rutter J.L. Mitchell T.I. Buttice G. Meyers J. Gusella J.F. Ozelius L.J. Brinckerhoff C.E. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 5321-5325PubMed Google Scholar), we found that in all cell contexts tested, the 2G allele displayed stronger activity than the 1G allele. The difference was greatest in A2058 melanoma cells and was more than 2-fold higher in amnion-derived cells including WISH cells and amnion mesenchymal cells. When transfected amnion mesenchymal cells were treated with 50 ng/ml PMA, we consistently found a modest increase in 2G promoter activity (20–30%) above the Me2SO control but no response of the 1G promoter. The modest impact of PMA appears to be because the transfection reagents activate signaling pathways mediating MMP-1 gene transcription.Table IRelative activities of MMP-1 promoters with −1607 2G or 1G polymorphismCell hostRatio of promoter activities95% confidence intervalA20586.29 ± 0.016.28–6.30WISH2.18 ± 0.012.15–2.21Amnion mesenchymal2.59 ± 0.012.58–2.60Cervical smooth muscle2.75 ± 0.012.75–2.76Promoter activities determined from relative luciferase activity units were examined in four different cell hosts.

Open table in a new tab Promoter activities determined from relative luciferase activity units were examined in four different cell hosts. Values presented are the mean ± S.E. from three independent experiments conducted with triplicate cultures. We analyzed the binding of nuclear proteins prepared from vehicle-treated and PMA-treated amnion mesenchymal cells to oligonucleotide probes containing either the 1G or 2G at −1607 (Fig. 2). Nuclear extracts from the Me2SO-treated cells produced two complexes, and the binding of nuclear proteins was equivalent for the 1G and 2G probes. In competition assays, binding to the higher mobility DNA-protein complex (arrow) was suppressed by unlabeled homologous oligonucleotide, but in the case of the 2G probe an oligonucleotide containing an AP-1 binding site without the Ets binding site was much less effective in blocking complex formation. A low mobility DNA-protein complex (arrowhead) was also observed which showed only modest suppression by unlabeled homologous oligonucleotide, with the unlabeled AP-1 site oligonucleotide being a less effective competitor. There was a striking difference between the 2G oligonucleotide compared with the 1G probe in the binding of nuclear proteins extracted from PMA-treated cells, suggesting that this agent stimulates the expression or activity of a specific nuclear protein that preferentially recognizes the 2G allele. The binding of proteins in the PMA-treated cell nuclear extracts to the 2G allele was specific in that the high mobility DNA-protein complex was inhibited by unlabeled homologous probe but not by the AP-1 probe. A consensus Ets binding site oligonucleotide, but not an oligonucleotide with a mutated Ets binding site, suppressed formation of the high mobility complex (Fig. 3). The low mobility DNA-protein complex of the 2G probe was also more prominent with nuclear proteins isolated from PMA-treated cells. Formation of this complex was blocked to some degree by homologous unlabeled oligonucleotide and significantly suppressed by the consensus Ets binding site and mutant Ets binding site oligonucleotides, and to a lesser extent by the unlabeled AP-1 probe. This complex is, therefore, unlikely to be Ets-specific, in contrast to the high mobility complex.Figure 3A consensus Ets binding site oligonucleotide competes for complex formation, but not an oligonucleotide with a mutated Ets binding site. Reactions were carried out with a labeled 2G oligonucleotide probe and nuclear extract from PMA-stimulated cells as described under “Experimental Procedures.”Arrows indicate the specific high mobility DNA-protein complex.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The nature of the nuclear protein(s) forming the DNA-protein complexes is not known, but presumably it is a member of the Ets transcription factor family based on studies conducted previously by Rutter et al. (19Rutter J.L. Mitchell T.I. Buttice G. Meyers J. Gusella J.F. Ozelius L.J. Brinckerhoff C.E. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 5321-5325PubMed Google Scholar), who first identified the polymorphism and showed that the 2G allele binds recombinant Ets-1. We conducted experiments with antibodies to Ets-1/Ets-2 and Elk-1, members of the Ets family of transcription factors, to determine whether they would ablate or supershift the complexes. Neither of the antibodies affected the complexes (data not shown). These findings suggest that another member of the Ets family is responsible for the complex formation. The partial inhibition of the complex formation by the AP-1 probe in our studies is not unexpected because Rutter et al. (19Rutter J.L. Mitchell T.I. Buttice G. Meyers J. Gusella J.F. Ozelius L.J. Brinckerhoff C.E. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 5321-5325PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrated that binding of recombinant Ets-1 to the 2G oligonucleotide probe was enhanced in the presence of c-Jun, indicating a possible cooperative interaction between proteins binding to the Ets and AP-1 sites. Quantitative real time PCR was performed to assess the induction of MMP-1 mRNA in amnion mesenchymal cells with different −1607 MMP-1 promoter genotypes in response to PMA. The activation ratio for MMP-1 mRNA expression, representing the PMA-induced MMP-1 mRNA abundance divided by the MMP-1 abundance in vehicle-treated cultures, was significantly greater in cells carrying the 2G allele (1G/2G heterozygotes and 2G/2G homozygotes) compared with cells with 1G/1G genotype (cells with 1G/1G genotype, 24.2 ± 9.2 (n = 4); cells with 1G/2G and 2G/2G genotypes, 365.5 ± 153.5 (n = 11); p < 0.01 by the Mann-Whitney Utest). Note that the variation in the response of cells resulted in relatively large standard errors in the activation ratios. This probably reflects the contribution of other biological variables affecting MMP-1 expression. Nonetheless, cells with the 1G/2G and 2G/2G genotypes had significantly greater MMP-1 mRNA"
https://openalex.org/W2088429363,"Recent evidence suggests that members of the Dickkopf (Dkk) family can directly bind to LDL-related protein (LRP)-6, resulting in inhibition of Wnt-activated signaling. To further characterize the interactions between Dkk and LRP proteins, conditioned media containing individually conserved cysteine-rich domains of Dkk-1 and Dkk-2 were prepared. Although full-length Dkk-1 and Dkk-2 and the second cysteine-rich domains of both Dkk molecules inhibited Wnt-3a-induced activation of lymphoid enhancing factor (LEF)-1, a downstream target of the canonical pathway, we found that the second cysteine-rich domain of Dkk-2 (Dkk-2C2) was able to stimulate the canonical pathway when LRP-6 was ectopically expressed in NIH3T3 cells. This effect of Dkk-2C2 could be blocked by a monoclonal antibody specific to the second YWTD repeat domain of LRP-5/6, suggesting that Dkk-2C2 acts via LRP-6. We also showed that while both Axin and the DIX domain of Dishevelled (Dvl) could inhibit Dkk-2C2-induced activation of LEF-1, the DEP domain of Dvl, which inhibited Wnt-induced activation of LEF-1, failed to inhibit the activation of LEF-1 by Dkk-2C2 or by an activated form of LRP-5, LRPC2. In addition, glycogen synthase kinase-3β, a potent inhibitor for both Dvl and Wnt, also failed to inhibit LRPC2 or Dkk-2C2. Furthermore, knocking-down the expression of Dvl molecules by short interfering RNAs specific to Dvl inhibited Wnt-induced, but not LRPC2-induced, activation of LEF-1. All the evidence indicates that Dkk-2C2 signals through LRP proteins, which does not require Dvl, while Wnt protein may employ both Dvl, presumably through Fz, and LRP to achieve more efficient signal transduction.

Nusse R. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 14: 59-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (1743) Google Scholar). Recently, LRP-5 and LRP-6, members of the LDL receptor superfamily, were found also to be required for the canonical Wnt signaling pathway. ADrosophila mutant arrow, which encodes a close homolog of LRP-5/6, shows phenotypes similar to the wgmutant (8Wehrli M. Dougan S.T. Caldwell K. O'Keefe L. Schwartz S. Vaizel-Ohayon D. Schejter E. Tomlinson A. DiNardo S. Nature. 2000; 407: 527-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar). In addition, mammalian LRP-6 was shown to bind to Wnt-1 and enhance Wnt-induced developmental processes in Xenopusembryos (9Tamai K. Semenov M. Kato Y. Spokony R. Liu C. Katsuyama Y. Hess F. Saint-Jeannet J.P. He X. Nature. 2000; 407: 530-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (1103) Google Scholar). Moreover, mice lacking LRP-6 exhibited developmental defects that are similar to those caused by deficiencies in various Wnt proteins (10Pinson K.I. Brennan J. Monkley S. Avery B.J. Skarnes W.C. Nature. 2000; 407: 535-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (904) Google Scholar). Our recent work revealed how LRP-5/6 might be involved in transducing signals. We found that Wnt proteins induce the binding of LRP-5 to Axin, leading to Axin degradation and β-catenin stabilization (11Mao J. Wang J. Liu B. Pan W. Farr G.H. Flynn C. Yuan H. Takada S. Kimelman D., Li, L. Wu D. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 801-809Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (703) Google Scholar). Xenopus Dickkopf (Dkk)-1 was initially discovered as a Wnt antagonist that plays an important role in head formation (12Glinka A., Wu, W. Delius H. Monaghan A.P. Blumenstock C. Niehrs C. Nature. 1998; 391: 357-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (1362) Google Scholar). By far, four members of Dkk have been identified in mammals (13Monaghan A.P. Kioschis P., Wu, W. Zuniga A. Bock D. Poustka A. Delius H. Niehrs C. Mech. Dev. 1999; 87: 45-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 14Krupnik V.E. Sharp J.D. Jiang C. Robison K. Chickering T.W. Amaravadi L. Brown D.E. Guyot D. Mays G.

Each Dkk molecule contains two conserved cysteine-rich domains as depicted in Fig. 1 A. The mechanism by which the Dkk family of proteins antagonizes Wnt effects was not known until recently. Several recent reports showed that Dkk-1 and Dkk-2 inhibited the canonical Wnt signaling by binding to LRP6 in cultured mammalian cells (15Mao B., Wu, W., Li, Y. Hoppe D. Stannek P. Glinka A. Niehrs C. Nature. 2001; 411: 321-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (908) Google Scholar, 16Semenov M.V. Tamai K. Brott B.K. Kuhl M. Sokol S. He X. Curr.

Nat Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 683-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar). However, Dkk-2 has also been shown to activate the Wnt/β-catenin pathway in Xenopus embryos (18Wu W. Glinka A. Delius H. Niehrs C. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 1611-1614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). To gain an understanding of this paradoxical phenomena and insight into the interactions between Dkk and LRP proteins, we examined the effect of each cysteine-rich domains of Dkk-1 and Dkk-2 on the canonical Wnt signaling in mammalian cells. We found that the second Cys-rich domains of Dkk1 and Dkk2 inhibited Wnt-3a-activated signaling, whereas the first Cys-rich domains had no effects. Intriguingly, the second Cys-rich domain of Dkk-2, but not that of Dkk-1, was able to activate the canonical pathway in the presence of LRP6, and this LRP-dependent signaling does not require Dvl. Human embryonic kidney cell line A293 and mouse fibroblast cell line NIH 3T3 were maintained and transfected as previously described (21Li L. Yuan H. Xie W. Mao J. McMahon E. Sussman D. Wu D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 129-134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). For luciferase assays, NIH3T3 cells in 24-well plates were seeded at 5 × 104 cells/well and transfected with 0.5 μg of DNA/well using LipofectAMINE Plus (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), as suggested by the manufacturer. Cell extracts were collected 24 h after transfection. Luciferase assays were performed as previously described (20Yuan H. Mao J., Li, L. Wu D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30419-30423Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 21Li L. Yuan H. Xie W. Mao J. McMahon E. Sussman D. Wu D. J. Biol.

For preparation of Dkk containing conditioned medium (CM), A293 cells were seeded in 6-well plates at 4 × 105 cells/well and transfected with 1 μg of DNA/well. CMs were collected 48 h after transfection. Wnt-3a-containing CM was prepared as previously described (11Mao J. Wang J. Liu B. Pan W. Farr G.H. Flynn C. Yuan H. Takada S. Kimelman D., Li, L. Wu D.

The wild-type and mutant forms of human LRP-5, LRP-6, mouse Wnt-1, Dvl-1, GSK-3β, and Axin were generated by PCR using the high fidelity thermostable DNA polymerase Pfu (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Myc, hemagglutinin, or FLAG epitope tags were introduced to the C termini of the full-length and mutant molecules. The expression of these molecules was driven by a cytomegalovirus promoter (20Yuan H. Mao J., Li, L. Wu D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30419-30423Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 21Li L. Yuan H. Xie W. Mao J. McMahon E. Sussman D. Wu D. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4233-4240Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). All constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. The LEF-1 reporter gene constructs were kindly provided by Dr. Grosschedl (19Hsu S.C. Galceran J. Grosschedl R. Mol. Cell Biol. 1998; 18: 4807-4818Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). The anti-LRP5/6 antibody was generated by A&G Pharmaceuticals (Baltimore, MD) using a synthetic peptide derived from a amino acid sequence (DTGTDRIEVTR) of the second YWTD repeat of LRP-6. The siRNA targeted both human Dvl-1 and Dvl-3 are derived from an mRNA sequence (AACAAGATCACCTTCTCCGAG) of human Dvl-3, which is identical in that of human Dvl-1, and the one targeted human Dvl-2 is derived from an mRNA sequence (AACTTTGAGAACATGAGCAAC) of human Dvl-2. The siRNA duplexes were prepared by Dharmacon Research (Lafayette, CO). Transfection of siRNA was performed based on a protocol provided by Dharmacon Research using Oligofectamine (Invitrogen). To investigate the effect of each Cys-rich domain of Dkk-1 and Dkk-2 on the canonical Wnt signaling pathway, we generated a number of plasmids expressing either full-length or individual Cys-rich domains of Dkk-1 and Dkk-2 as depicted in Fig.1 A. CM generated in A293 cells was analyzed by Western blotting using a monoclonal antibody specific to the FLAG tag contained by all the recombinant proteins. As shown in Fig. 1 B, both Dkk full-length proteins and their Cys-rich domains were detected in CM. It appeared that Dkk-2C2 might not be significantly modified by glycosylation because the molecular weight deduced from its amino acid sequence matches its motility in the SDS-PAGE and because secreted Dkk-2C2 detected in CM showed the same electrophoretic motility as that detected in the whole cell lysates (Fig. 1 B). On the other hand, Dkk-1C2 appeared to be modified with glycosylation manifested by multiple bands detected by Western analysis (Fig. 1 B). The effect of CM containing either full-length Dkk proteins or their Cys-rich domains on the canonical Wnt signaling was determined by examining the LEF-1-dependent transcriptional activity using a luciferase reporter gene assay. Numerous reports have established that the Wnt-1 class of Wnt proteins, which also includes Wnt-3a, activates LEF-1-dependent transcription via stabilization of β-catenin (11Mao J. Wang J. Liu B.

EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4233-4240Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). We found that none of CMs alone showed any effect on LEF-1-dependent transcription when CMs were added to NIH3T3 cells transfected with the LEF-1-dependent reporter gene (Fig.2 A). CM containing Wnt-3a was able to activate LEF-1 in the same system (Fig. 2 A) as we have previously shown (11Mao J. Wang J. Liu B. Pan W. Farr G.H. Flynn C. Yuan H. Takada S. Kimelman D., Li, L. Wu D. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 801-809Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (703) Google Scholar). When CM containing a Dkk protein or one of the Cys-rich domains was added together with CM containing Wnt-3a, the full-length Dkk-1 and Dkk-2 as well as the second Cys-rich domains of both Dkk-1 and Dkk-2 inhibited Wnt-3a-induced activation of LEF-1 (Fig.2 A). The inhibitory effects of full-length Dkk proteins seen here are consistent with those previously reported (15Mao B., Wu, W., Li, Y. Hoppe D. Stannek P. Glinka A. Niehrs C. Nature. 2001; 411: 321-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (908) Google Scholar, 16Semenov M.V. Tamai K. Brott B.K. Kuhl M. Sokol S. He X. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 951-961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar, 17Bafico A. Liu G. Yaniv A. Gazit A. Aaronson S.A. Nat Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 683-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar). The fact that neither of the first Cys-rich domains of Dkk-1 and Dkk-2 inhibited the Wnt-3a effect (Fig. 2 A) suggests that the second cysteine-rich domain mediates the inhibitory effect of Dkk molecules. Previous studies on Dkk proteins (15Mao B., Wu, W., Li, Y. Hoppe D. Stannek P. Glinka A. Niehrs C. Nature. 2001; 411: 321-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (908) Google Scholar, 16Semenov M.V. Tamai K. Brott B.K. Kuhl M. Sokol S. He X. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 951-961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar, 17Bafico A. Liu G. Yaniv A. Gazit A. Aaronson S.A. Nat Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 683-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar) found that overexpression of LRP-6 was able to attenuate the inhibitory effects of the full-length Dkk proteins. Consistent with these findings, we found that expression of LRP-6 alleviated the inhibition by the full-length Dkk-1 or Dkk-2 (Fig. 2 B). Although the expression of LRP-6 also abolished the inhibition caused by Dkk-1C2, we were surprised to find that Dkk-2C2 activated LEF-1 in the presence LRP-6 and that there appeared to be an additive effect between Dkk-2C2 and Wnt-3a in activation of LEF-1 (Fig. 2 B). We also examined the effect of LRP-5; Dkk-2C2 showed a marginal effect on LEF-1 activation in the presence of LRP-5 (Fig. 3 A). To gain a better look at this Dkk-2C2-mediated effect on the canonical Wnt signaling, we examined the dose-dependence by serial dilution of CM containing Dkk-2C2 in comparison to CM containing Wnt-3a. The maximal activation (about 4-fold) was reached at 1:4 dilution (Fig. 3 B). Addition of more CM containing Dkk-2C2 appeared to cause a decline in the activity, indicating a bell-shaped dose-dependence. In comparison, the Wnt3a CM showed a higher activity than the Dkk-2C2 CM and did not exhibit the bell-shape dose dependence (Fig. 3 B). To understand how Dkk-2C2 activates the canonical Wnt signaling pathway, we first wanted to determine whether the signaling events induced by Dkk-2C2 are mediated by LRP-6. We obtained a monoclonal antibody kindly provided by A&G Pharmaceuticals raised against a synthetic peptide derived from the second YWTD repeat of human LRP-6. These residues are completely conserved between human and mouse and between LRP-5 and LRP-6. Western analysis using this monoclonal antibody showed that the antibody detected two bands in the particulate fraction prepared from NIH3T3 cells, and both bands were intensified in the particulate fraction sample from cells transfected with LRP-6 (Fig.4 A). In addition, neither band was detected in the soluble fractions (Fig. 4 A). The upper band with an apparent molecular mass larger than 175 kDa appears to be the full-length LRP-6, whereas the exact nature of the lower molecular mass band is not clear, which may be a proteolytic fragment LRP-6. The antibody was tested for neutralizing the activity induced by Wnt-3a or Dkk-2C2. As shown in Fig. 4 B, the anti-LRP antibody significantly inhibited Dkk-2C2, and Wnt-3a-induced activation of LEF-1 by 80 and 50%, respectively. The antibody showed little effect on β-catenin or Dvl-induced activation of LEF-1 (Fig.4 B). This result suggests that both Wnt-3a and Dkk-2C2 signal through LRP-6 and its homologs. We have previously shown that interactions of LRP-5/6 with Axin are involved in LRP-mediated signaling and that expression of Axin could block the activity of an activated form of LRP-5, LRPC2 (15Mao B., Wu, W., Li, Y. Hoppe D. Stannek P. Glinka A. Niehrs C. Nature. 2001; 411: 321-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (908) Google Scholar). We tested if Axin would block Dkk-2C2-mediated activation of LEF-1. Fig.5 A shows that expression of Axin blocked Dkk-2C2's effect. Previous studies have also suggested that Dvl might act downstream of LRP on the basis of the observation that the DIX domain of Dvl could inhibit LRP-mediated effects (9Tamai K. Semenov M. Kato Y. Spokony R. Liu C. Katsuyama Y. Hess F. Saint-Jeannet J.P. He X. Nature. 2000; 407: 530-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (1103) Google Scholar). We also observed an inhibitory effect of Dvl DIX domain on LEF-1 activation by Dkk-2C2 (Fig. 5 A) or LRPC2 (Fig.5 B). However, because the DIX domain of Axin is required for the interaction of Axin with LRPC2 (11Mao J. Wang J. Liu B. Pan W. Farr G.H. Flynn C. Yuan H. Takada S. Kimelman D., Li, L. Wu D. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 801-809Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (703) Google Scholar) and Axin DIX interacts with Dvl DIX (22Li L. Yuan H. Weaver C. Mao J. Farr III, G.H. Sussman D.J. Jonkers J. Kimelman D. Wu D. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4233-4240Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar), overexpression of Dvl DIX may inhibit LRPC2 by interfering the interaction of LRPC2 with Axin. To more definitively evaluate the involvement of Dvl in LRP signaling, we used another previously defined Dvl-derived dominant negative mutant, the Dvl DEP domain. It was shown to inhibit Wnt signaling by interacting with upstream regulators of Dvl (23Wong H.C. Mao J. Nguyen J.T. Srinivas S. Zhang W. Liu B., Li, L., Wu, D. Zheng J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 1178-1184Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Although Dvl DEP inhibited Wnt-3a-induced activation of LEF-1 (Fig. 5 D), it showed no effect on Dkk-2C2- or LRPC2-induced activation of LEF-1 (Fig. 5, A and B). In addition, we found that GSK, which inhibits both Wnt and Dvl-induced LEF-1 activation (Fig. 5, C and D) (24He X. Saint-Jeannet J.P. Woodgett J.R. Varmus H.E. Dawid I.B. Nature. 1995; 374: 617-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar), had little effect on the activation of LEF-1 by either Dkk-2C2 or LRPC2. We interpret these results to suggest that Dvl may not be required for LRP-mediated canonical Wnt signaling. To further confirm the idea that Dvl may not be involved in LRP-mediated signaling, we employed a newly developed technique, short interfering RNA (siRNA) (25Elbashir S.M. Harborth J. Lendeckel W. Yalcin A. Weber K. Tuschl T. Nature. 2001; 411: 494-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (8186) Google Scholar), to knock down the Dvl expression. Two siRNAs consisting of 21-mer duplexed RNA were designed; one is based a nucleotide sequence shared by human Dvl-1 and Dvl-3, and the other is based on a sequence from human Dvl-2 that has one nucleotide mismatch from Dvl-3. To examine the efficacy and specificity of this siRNA-mediated knocking-down approach, we examined the levels of Dvl-3 proteins in A293 cells treated with or without siRNAs by Western analysis using a monoclonal antibody specific to Dvl-3. The Dvl-3 protein can be readily detected in these cells by this antibody (Fig.6 A). The siRNA specific to Dvl1 and Dvl-3 could knock down the protein level of Dvl-3 by approximate 70% after a three-day treatment, whereas the siRNA specific to Dvl-2 also showed some effect on Dvl-3 expression; an approximate 15% inhibition. We also detected the levels of Actin as an internal control to exclude potential variations introduced by siRNA treatment or sample loading (Fig. 6 A). These results indicate that this knocking-down approach yields a reasonable efficacy and specificity. To test the effect of these siRNAs on LEF-1 activation, A293 cells were first transfected with siRNAs and 2 days later with the LEF reporter gene and Wnt3a or LRPC2. These Dvl-specific siRNA molecules inhibited Wnt-3a-induced LEF-1 activation by close to 70%, whereas they had no effects on LRPC2-induced activation of LEF-1 (Fig. 6). This result corroborates our conclusion that Dvl may not play a role in LRP-mediated LEF-1 activation. Previous reports have demonstrated that Dkk-1 and Dkk-2 are antagonists of Wnt proteins that activate the canonical pathway in mammalian cells (15Mao B., Wu, W., Li, Y. Hoppe D. Stannek P. Glinka A. Niehrs C. Nature. 2001; 411: 321-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (908) Google Scholar, 16Semenov M.V. Tamai K. Brott B.K. Kuhl M. Sokol S. He X. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 951-961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar, 17Bafico A. Liu G. Yaniv A. Gazit A. Aaronson S.A. Nat Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 683-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar). In this report, we describe that the second Cys-rich domain of Dkk-2, but not that of Dkk-1, can act as an agonist for the canonical Wnt signaling pathway in mammalian cells. More importantly, we present evidence indicating that Dkk-2C2 functions through LRP-6 and that this LRP-mediated signaling may not require Dvl. Thus, it appears that LRP and Fz may utilize distinct mechanisms for their immediate signaling events. Although the mechanisms by which Fz regulates its immediate intracellular signaling components are not clear, one mechanism for LRP may be mediated by the interaction with and destabilization of Axin (11Mao J. Wang J. Liu B. Pan W. Farr G.H. Flynn C. Yuan H. Takada S. Kimelman D., Li, L. Wu D. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 801-809Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (703) Google Scholar). It is apparent that Dkk-2C2 uses only LRP in its signal transduction while Wnt-3a uses both LRP and Fz in its activation of LEF-1 as depicted in Fig. 7. Several lines of evidence support this idea. 1) Genetic studies in Drosophilahave clearly demonstrated that both Fz (26Bhanot P. Brink M. Harryman C. Hsieh J.C. Wang Y. Macke J.P. Andrew D. Nathans J. Nusse R. Nature. 1996; 382: 225-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (1235) Google Scholar, 27Chen C.M. Struhl G. Development. 1999; 126: 5441-5452PubMed Google Scholar) and LRP (8Wehrli M. Dougan S.T. Caldwell K. O'Keefe L. Schwartz S. Vaizel-Ohayon D. Schejter E. Tomlinson A. DiNardo S. Nature. 2000; 407: 527-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar) are required for the signaling of Wg, the fly homolog of Wnt-1. 2) The LRP-specific antibody blocked activity of both Wnt and Dkk-2C2 (Fig. 4 B), suggesting both Wnt and Dkk-2C2 require LRP for their signaling. The apparent low potency of this antibody in neutralizing Wnt-3a may be due to its low affinity for other YWTD repeat sequences (data not shown) that may be involved in Wnt recognition or its low neutralizing activity. 3) While Dvl has been solidly identified as a downstream effector for Fz by epistasis analysis in the study of Drosophila (1Moon R.T. Kimelman D. Bioessays. 1998; 20: 536-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar, 2Wodarz A. Nusse R. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 14: 59-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (1743) Google Scholar, 3Peifer M. Polakis P. Science. 2000; 287: 1606-1609Crossref PubMed Scopus (1146) Google Scholar), we showed that Dvl is not required for Dkk-2C2 and LRP-mediated activation of LEF-1 because GSK (a potent inhibitor of Dvl and Fz) and Dvl DEP could not inhibit the activation of LEF-1 by Dkk-2C2 or by an activated form of LRP, LRPC2 (Fig. 5). The finding that knocking down the expression of Dvl only inhibited Wnt-induced, but not LRPC2-induced, activity (Fig.6) further supports the conclusion that Dvl may not be required for Dkk-2C2 and LRP-mediated signaling. Although it was shown that expression of wild-type Dvl could rescue an arrow mutant (Arrow is the fly homolog of LRP-5/6) (8Wehrli M. Dougan S.T. Caldwell K. O'Keefe L. Schwartz S. Vaizel-Ohayon D. Schejter E. Tomlinson A. DiNardo S. Nature. 2000; 407: 527-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar), the complete epistatic relationship between Arrow and Dvl needs to be established by showing that hypomorphic or null dsh alleles can suppress the activity of an activated form of LRP or the overexpression of wild-type LRP. 4) Dkk proteins were shown to bind to LRP proteins, but not Fz proteins (15Mao B., Wu, W., Li, Y. Hoppe D. Stannek P. Glinka A. Niehrs C. Nature. 2001; 411: 321-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (908) Google Scholar, 16Semenov M.V. Tamai K. Brott B.K. Kuhl M. Sokol S. He X. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 951-961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar). However, there is an apparent discrepancy in describing the binding of Dkk-2 to LRP-5. Our measurement using a fusion protein of Dkk-2 and alkaline phosphatase suggests that Dkk-2C2 can bind to LRP-5, but with a significant lower affinity than that for LRP-6 (data not shown). The low affinity for LRP-5 may explain the low activity of Dkk-2C2 in the presence of LRP-5 (Fig. 3 A). 5) Dkk-2C2 activated the canonical pathway only when LRP-6 was overexpressed, suggesting a dependence on LRP-6 for its activity. This also suggests that Dkk-2C2 only signals when a sufficient amount of LRP-6 is present and that NIH3T3 cells may not contain enough endogenous LRP-6 for Dkk-2C2 to function despite that we can detect LRP-6 in these cells by both Western (Fig. 4 A) and reverse transcription-PCR (data not shown). It seems to be paradoxical that Dkk-2C2 inhibits Wnt's effect in the absence of LRP-6, while it acted additively with Wnt in activation of LEF-1 in the presence of LRP-6 (Fig. 2). We would explain this apparent paradox to suggest that Wnt is a more potent ligand for activating the canonical pathway than Dkk-2C2. The dose-dependence study (Fig.3 B) supports this point. In addition, we also noticed that Dkk-2C2 showed a bell-shape dose-dependent curve, suggesting that Dkk-2C2's activity declines at higher doses. Thus, it is not difficult to understand that the relative inefficiency of Dkk-2C2 in activating the canonical pathway would become antagonistic to Wnt by competing for binding to the limited number of endogenous LRP required for Wnt to signal. The high efficiency of Wnt-activated signaling that is enabled by the utilization of both LRP and Dvl-mediated pathway as proposed in the model shown in Fig. 7 may be required for many Wnt-regulated biological processes, which may include fly embryonic development where disruption of either pathway led to the similar phenotypic outcomes. Our finding that Dkk-2C2 can activate the canonical pathway may also help to understand the paradox that although both Dkk-1 and Dkk-2, when transfected in mammalian cells, inhibited the canonical Wnt activity, only Dkk-1 apparently antagonized the canonical pathway inXenopus. Dkk-2, when its RNA was injected intoXenopus embryos, activated the canonical pathway (18Wu W. Glinka A. Delius H. Niehrs C. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 1611-1614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). It is possible that Dkk-2 is proteolytically processed in Xenopusembryos, thus producing Dkk-2C2-like molecules that can activate the canonical pathway. Alternatively, accessory proteins may exist in these embryos, presenting Dkk-2 in an agonistic form. Therefore, it would be of great interest to determine whether Dkk-2C2-like molecules exist naturally and to understand the physiological significance of their existence. Nevertheless, even if Dkk-2C2-like molecules do not exist naturally, they are useful tools for studying LRP-6-mediated signaling events. We thank R. Russe for Wnt-3a-expressing L1 cells, D. H.

FGF-18 stimulated the proliferation of cultured mouse primary osteoblasts, osteoblastic MC3T3-E1 cells, primary chondrocytes, and prechondrocytic ATDC5 cells, although it inhibited the differentiation and matrix synthesis of these cells. FGF-18 up-regulated the phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase in both osteoblasts and chondrocytes and up-regulated the phosphorylation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase only in chondrocytes. FGF-18 mitogenic actions were blocked by a specific inhibitor of extracellular signal-regulated kinase in both osteoblasts and chondrocytes and by a specific inhibitor of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase in chondrocytes. With regard to the action of FGF-18 on bone resorption, FGF-18 not only induced osteoclast formation through receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB ligand and cyclooxygenase-2 but also stimulated osteoclast function to form resorbed pits on a dentine slice in the mouse coculture system. All these effects of FGF-18 bore a close resemblance to those of FGF-2, whereas FGF-10 affects none of these cells. FGF-18 may therefore compensate for the action of FGF-2 on bone and cartilage."

A single AHR gene has been identified in mammals, whereas many fish species, including the Atlantic killifish (Fundulus heteroclitus) possess two distinctAHR genes (AHR1 and a novel form,AHR2). A mouse bHLH-PAS protein closely related to AHR and designated AHR repressor (AHRR) is induced by 3-methylcholanthrene and represses the transcriptional activity of the AHR. To determine whether AHRR is the mammalian ortholog of fish AHR2 and to investigate the mechanisms by which AHRR regulates AHR function, we cloned an AHRR ortholog in F. heteroclitus with high sequence identity to the mouse and human AHRRs. Killifish AHRR encodes a 680-residue protein with a predicted molecular mass of 75.2 kDa. We show that in vitro expressed AHRR proteins from human, mouse, and killifish all fail to bind [3H]TCDD or [3H]β-naphthoflavone. In transient transfection experiments using a luciferase reporter gene under control of AHR response elements, killifish AHRR inhibited the TCDD-dependent transactivation function of both AHR1 and AHR2. AHRR mRNA is widely expressed in killifish tissues and is inducible by TCDD or polychlorinated biphenyls, but its expression is not altered in a population of fish exhibiting genetic resistance to these compounds. The F. heteroclitus AHRR promoter contains three putative AHR response elements. Both AHR1 and AHR2 activated transcription of luciferase driven by the AHRR promoter, and AHRR could repress its own promoter. Thus, AHRR is an evolutionarily conserved, TCDD-inducible repressor of AHR1 and AHR2 function.

A better understanding of the function and regulation of the AHR signaling pathway requires a more complete characterization of the diversity of positive and negative regulatory factors and the interactions among them. The identification of AHRR in mice and humans raised several questions concerning the evolutionary and functional relationships between AHR1, AHR2, and AHRR. Are fish AHR2and mammalian AHRR orthologous genes (i.e.descended from a single ancestral gene in the last common ancestor of fish and mammals) or do fish also possess an AHRR gene? Is AHRR capable of repressing the function of both AHR1 and AHR2? Are both AHR1 and AHR2 involved in the regulation of AHRR expression? Is AHRR capable of high affinity binding of TCDD and other aromatic compounds that are known ligands for AHR/AHR1 and AHR2 (1Poland A. Glover E. Kende A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 4936-4946Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Karchner S.I. Powell W.H. Hahn M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33814-33824Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar)? Does enhanced expression of AHRR occur in fish selected for genetic resistance to TCDD? To understand the relationship between mammalian AHRR and fish AHR2 and to investigate the mechanisms by which (i) AHRR regulates AHR function and (ii) AHRs regulate AHRR expression, we cloned and characterized an AHRR homolog from the estuarine teleost Fundulus heteroclitus (mummichog or Atlantic killifish). F. heteroclitus is an early vertebrate model system for studying the function, evolution, and adaptive significance of AHR signaling pathways. We have characterized previously other killifish bHLH-PAS proteins, including AHR1 and AHR2 (10Hahn M.E. Karchner S.I. Shapiro M.A. Perera S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biophys. 1999; 361: 156-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), and HIF-2α (27Powell, W. H., and Hahn, M. E. (2002) J. Exp. Zool., in pressGoogle Scholar), and their role in evolved resistance to dioxins (28Powell W.H. Bright R. Bello S.M. Hahn M.E. Toxicol. Sci. 2000; 57: 229-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 29Bello S.M. Franks D.G. Stegeman J.J. Hahn M.E. Toxicol. Sci. 2001; 60: 77-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). We show here that F. heteroclitus expresses an AHRR homolog that is able to repress the transactivation function of both AHR1 and AHR2 as well as the murine AHR. We also show (i) that killifish AHRR expression is inducible by TCDD and by PCBs in a variety of tissues in vivo, (ii) that this occurs through AHRE sequences in its promoter and can be mediated by either AHR1 or AHR2, and (iii) that the killifish AHRR is able to repress the function of its own promoter. However, AHRR expression, like that of other AHR-regulated genes such as CYP1A1, is not induced in fish selected for genetic resistance to TCDD. In addition, we demonstrate that neither killifish AHRR, mouse AHRR, nor human AHRR is able to support high affinity binding of the AHR ligands [3H]TCDD or [3H]BNF, suggesting that the repressive function of this protein is ligand-independent. Finally, our findings reveal thatAHRR is one of three members of the vertebrateAHR gene family, which arose by duplication and divergence of a single ancestral AHR gene. 2,3,7,8-Tetrachloro[1,6-3H]dibenzo-p-dioxin ([3H]TCCD, 35 Ci/mmol, >99% radiochemical purity as assessed by high pressure liquid chromatography (30Gasiewicz T.A.

Gene-specific primers were coupled with adaptor primers in the PCR using Advantage DNA polymerase mix (CLONTECH). For 5′-RACE, primer RRr1 and nested primer RRr2 were used. For 3′-RACE, primer RRf1 and nested primer RRf2 were used. The touchdown PCR (31Don R.H. Cox P.T. Wainwright B.J. Baker K. Mattick J.S.

All PCR products were cloned into the pGEM-T Easy vector (Promega, Madison, WI) and sequenced on an Applied Biosystems Inc. 373A Stretch DNA Sequencer (University of Maine DNA Sequencing Facility, Orono, ME). DNA sequences were assembled and translated using MacVector/AssemblyLign sequence analysis software (Oxford Molecular Group, Madison, WI). Multiple sequence alignments were performed using ClustalX (32Thompson J.D. Gibson T.J. Plewniak F. Jeanmougin F. Higgins D.G.

Full-length AHR repressor cDNA was amplified with the primers RRkoz2 and RRterm2 from the cDNA prepared for the RACE procedure above. The clones were digested withKpnI and XbaI at the primer sites and ligated into the same sites in pcDNA 3.1/Zeo (+) vector (Invitrogen, Inc., Carlsbad, CA) to make pcDNA-FhAHRR. Several full-length clones were sequenced to ensure accuracy of the sequence. The pGL-RR reporter construct was made by inserting the 2358-bp AHRR promoter fragment into pGL3-Basic vector (Promega) to direct expression of the luciferase reporter gene. The mouse AHRR cDNA (plasmid pBSKmAhRR; a gift from Y. Fujii-Kuriyama, Tohoku University, Japan) (22Mimura J. Ema M. Sogawa K. Fujii-Kuriyama Y.

The killifish AHR2 expression plasmid pcDNA-FhAHR2 was prepared by subcloning the insert from pDPFhAHR2 (17Karchner S.I. Powell W.H. Hahn M.E. J. Biol.

The killifish AHR1 expression plasmid pcDNA-FhAHR1*1 represents the predominant AHR1 allele; it is highly similar to the sequence of the pSPFhAHR1 construct reported earlier (17Karchner S.I.

TnT Quick-coupled Reticulocyte Lysate Systems (Promega) were used to synthesize [35S]methionine-labeled or unlabeled proteins following manufacturer's directions. Five μl of the [35S]methionine-labeled TnT reactions were subjected to SDS-PAGE, followed by fluorography. AHR and AHRR ligand binding was determined using unlabeled proteins by velocity sedimentation on sucrose gradients in a vertical tube rotor as described previously (17Karchner S.I. Powell W.H.

The TnT reactions were incubated overnight at 4 °C with [3H]TCDD (8 nm) ± TCDF (800 nm) or with [3H]BNF (10 nm) ± BNF (1 μm). Nonspecific binding was determined by reactions containing an empty vector (unprogrammed lysate (UPL)) as described previously (17Karchner S.I. Powell W.H. Hahn M.E. J. Biol.

COS-7 monkey kidney cells were purchased from ATCC (Manassas, VA) and maintained in DMEM (Sigma) supplemented with fetal calf serum (10% final concentration) (Sigma) at 37 °C under 5% CO2. Cells were plated at 4 × 104 cells/well in 48-well plates. Transfections were carried out 24 h after plating in triplicate wells. DNA and LipofectAMINE 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) were each diluted in serum-free DMEM. For each well, a total of ∼300 ng of DNA was complexed with 1 μl of LipofectAMINE 2000. The mixture was then added to cells in DMEM with serum. Cells were treated 5 h after transfection with either Me2SO or TCDD (10 nm) at 0.5% final Me2SO concentration.Renilla luciferase (pRL-TK, Promega) was used as the transfection control. The amounts of transfected killifish AHR1 and AHR2 DNA were adjusted to optimize the fold inducibility of pGudLuc6.1 over basal reporter expression. Killifish AHR1, AHR2, ARNT2 and AHRR expression constructs were in pcDNA3.1 driven by the CMV promoter. Transfected DNA amounts were 5 ng of AHR1, 0.5 ng of AHR2, 50 ng of ARNT2, 20 ng of pGudLuc 6.1, and 3 ng of pRL-TK, unless otherwise indicated. The total amount of transfected DNA was kept constant by addition of pcDNA vector with no insert. Cells were lysed 18 h after dosing, and luminescence was measured using the Dual Luciferase Assay kit (Promega) in a TD 20/20 Luminometer (Turner Designs, Sunnyvale, CA). The final luminescence values are expressed as a ratio of the firefly luciferase units to the Renilla luciferase units. Total RNA was isolated from several tissues of killifish treated with TCDD or a mixture of PCBs (65% Aroclor 1254, 35% Aroclor 1242); expression of AHR1, AHR2, and CYP1A in these samples has been reported previously (28Powell W.H. Bright R. Bello S.M. Hahn M.E. Toxicol. Sci. 2000; 57: 229-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Total RNA (2 μg) was reverse-transcribed using the Omniscript cDNA synthesis kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). The RRfwd/RRrev primer pair was used to amplify a 735-bp fragment of the killifish AHRR, and a 349-bp actin fragment was amplified in separate PCRs using actinF/actinR primers. The primer pairs for AHRR were designed to overlap exon-exon junctions, thereby avoiding amplification of any contaminating genomic DNA. The linear range for the amplification was determined by varying the number of cycles from 20 to 35 with 3-cycle increments and using 2, 4, 6, and 8 μl of template cDNA in a 100-μl reaction (data not shown). Final reaction conditions included 4 μl of template cDNA in each reaction with AmpliTaq Gold DNA polymerase (PerkinElmer Life Sciences); the numbers of amplification cycles chosen in the linear range for AHRR and actin were 33 and 28 cycles, respectively. The cycling conditions are as follows: 95 °C, 10 min, 95 °C, 15 s, 65 °C, 30 s for 33 or 28 cycles; 72 °C, 7 min. Under these conditions, the amount of PCR products amplified from gonad cDNA was linearly related to cycle number and amount of template. Ten-μl aliquots from each reaction were run on 1.5% agarose gels, followed by ethidium bromide staining. Band intensities were quantified using a ChemImager 4000 low light imaging system (Alpha Innotech, San Leandro, CA) with automatic background subtraction. Previously, we identified two highly divergent AHR homologs (AHR1 and AHR2) inF. heteroclitus (17Karchner S.I. Powell W.H. Hahn M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33814-33824Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). In light of the recent characterization of a mammalian AHR-related bHLH-PAS protein, AHRR (22Mimura J. Ema M. Sogawa K. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 20-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar), we sought to determine the relationship between mammalian AHRR and fish AHR2 by investigating the presence of an AHRR homolog in killifish and characterizing its interactions with AHR1 and AHR2. Degenerate PCR primers, designed to recognize regions that are conserved among mouse and human AHRR proteins but divergent from AHRs, were used in RT-PCR. The primer pair Qf/RR-8r amplified a 670-bp cDNA from killifish ovary. The deduced amino acid sequence of this fragment shared 63% identity with the corresponding region of the mouse AHRR but was distinct from killifish AHR1 (47% amino acid identity) and AHR2 (48% identity). The complete coding sequence for this cDNA, including 330 bp of 5′UTR and 50 bp of 3′UTR, was obtained by RACE (Fig. 1); sequence analysis c"

The cell death is painless and without inflammation, consistent with an apoptotic mechanism. We have investigated the possibility that the LHON mutation confers a pro-apoptotic stimulus and have tested the sensitivity of osteosarcoma-derived cybrid cells carrying the most common and severe mutations (11778 and 3460) to cell death induced by Fas. We observed that LHON cybrids were sensitized to Fas-dependent death. Control cells that bear the same mitochondrial genetic background (the J haplogroup) without the pathogenic 11778 mutation are no more sensitive than other controls, indicating that increased Fas-dependent death in LHON cybrids was induced by the LHON pathogenic mutations. The type of death was apoptotic by several criteria, including induction by Fas, inhibition by the caspase inhibitor zVAD-fmk (zVal-Ala-Asp-fluoro-methyl ketone), activation of DEVDase activity (Asp-Glu-Val-Asp protease), specific cleavage of caspase-3, DNA fragmentation, and increased Annexin-V labeling. These data indicate that the most common and severe LHON pathogenic mutations 11778 and 3460 predispose cells to apoptosis, which may be relevant for the pathophysiology of cell death in LHON, and potential therapy."

This includes fast neurotransmitter release, gene expression, neuronal plasticity, migration, and differentiation (7Catterall W.A. Cell Calcium. 1998; 24: 307-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). P/Q-type Ca2+ channels are very tightly coupled to neurotransmitter release in many neurons (see e.g. Refs. 8Qian J.

This also explains why genetic defects, despite causing only minor changes in channel gating or expression, can lead to the above-mentioned clinical symptoms in humans and to the severe neurological abnormalities (absence epilepsy, dystonia, and ataxia) in spontaneous mouse mutants (16Fletcher C.F.

All these mutations form functional channels but cause detectable changes in Ca2+ channel gating and/or affect current densities. In contrast to FHM, most of the structural changes in the α1A subunit gene (CACNA1) associated with EA-2 cause α1A subunit truncations. Therefore, they are expected to lead to a complete loss of channel function. A mutation introducing a premature stop in codon 1820 (leading to an α1A lacking the C-terminal tail) is completely devoid of channel function after heterologous expression inXenopus oocytes and even exerts a dominant negative effect on co-expressed wild type (WT) α1A (4Jouvenceau A.

Lancet. 2001; 358: 801-807Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). α1A mutation F1491S is an EA-2 missense mutant not causing truncation. Unlike FHM missense mutants, it also completely abolishes channel function (20Guida S. Trettel F. Pagnutti S. Mantuano E. Tottene A. Veneziano L. Fellin T. Spadaro M. Stauderman K. Williams M.

These observations raise the interesting possibility that within the disease spectrum of autosomal dominant α1A Ca2+ channel defects, a complete loss of function favors clinical symptoms dominated by episodic ataxia. To test this hypothesis further, we functionally characterized two additional mutations in human α1A causing EA-2, G293R, and AY1593/1594D (Fig. 1 A). The G293R mutation causes a severe progressive ataxia but also EA-2-like symptoms in some family members (3Yue Q. Jen J.C. Nelson S.F. Baloh R.W. Am. J. Hum.

First strand synthesis was performed by using the Ready-to-Go T-primed first-strand kit (Amersham Biosciences). Six α1A fragments were amplified from first strands with PCR primers flanking suitable native restriction enzyme sites. PCR fragments were as follows (nucleotide numbers (nt) indicated in parentheses; asterisks indicate artificial restriction enzyme sites of the out-of-frame 5′ and 3′ termini introduced by PCR): A, SalI*-NotI (nt −5–602); B1,NotI-EcoRI (nt 602–1568); B2,EcoRI-AatII (nt 1568–2875); C1,AatII-EcoRI (nt 2875–4319); C2,EcoRI-HindIII (nt 4319–5274); and D,HindIII-BamHI* (5274–6794). Fragments A, B1, and D were cloned into vector pBluescript SK+ (Stratagene), and fragments B2, C1, and C2 were cloned into pSport-1 (Invitrogen). Sequence integrity of all PCR fragments was confirmed by sequence analysis (MWG Biotech, Ebersberg, Germany). The complete α1A cDNA clone was assembled from these fragments and finally introduced into the mammalian expression plasmid pGFP (21Koschak A. Reimer D. Huber I. Grabner M. Glossmann H. Engel J.

For heterologous expression in Xenopus laevis oocytes, α1A cDNA was cloned into theHindIII/BamHI polylinker sites of the polyadenylating transcription plasmid pNKS2 (a gift of O.

For heterologous expression in mammalian cells, theSalI*-BamHI* fragment (nt −5–6794) of α1A/pGFP was ligated into vector pCI-neo. G293R was generated using a NotI-EcoRI cassette (nt 602–1568). For heterologous expression in X. laevisoocytes, the mutated cassette was subsequently ligated intoNotI-AatII-cut α1A/pNKS2 (nt 602–2875) together with an EcoRI-AatII fragment (nt 1568–2875) of α1A. For expression in mammalian cells, aNotI-SalI fragment (nt 602–3′-polylinker of pNKS2) of G293R/pNKS2 containing the respective mutation was cloned into NotI-SalI-cut α1A/pCI-neo. R1279Stop was generated using a SfiI-SspI cassette (nt 3267–3943). The mutated cassette was cloned into aNotI-KpnI (nt 602–4450) subclone in pBluescript SK+. The mutation was subsequently transferred to α1A/pNKS2 as aNotI-KpnI fragment to yield R1279Stop/pNKS2. R1279Stop/pCI-neo was generated as described for G293R. AY1593/1594D (designated AY/D) was constructed using aKpnI-EcoRV cassette (nt 4450–4933). To yield AY/D/pNKS2, the mutated cassette was cloned intoKpnI-EcoRV-cut α1A/pNKS2. To generate AY/D/pCI-neo, a NotI-XbaI (nt 602–3′polylinker of pNKS2) fragment of AY/D/pNKS2 was transferred to α1A/pCI-neo. tsA-201 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Coon's F-12 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum (Sebak), 2 mml-glutamine, and 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin at 37 °C and 7% CO2. For transient Ca2+channel expression, cells were grown to 80% confluency and plated at dilutions of 1:10 on glass cov- erslips 12 h before transfection by Ca2+ phosphate precipitation using standard protocols. Human WT and mutant α1A subunits were expressed together with α2δ and β1a (21Koschak A. Reimer D. Huber I. Grabner M. Glossmann H. Engel J. Striessnig J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22100-22106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). The cells were incubated at 30 °C and 5% CO2 12 h after transfection for 2–5 days prior to recording or membrane preparation. For single channel analysis, HEK-293 cells were cultured and transfected as described previously (21Koschak A. Reimer D. Huber I. Grabner M. Glossmann H. Engel J. Striessnig J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22100-22106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). Capped run-off poly(A)+ cRNA transcripts fromXbaI-linearized cDNA templates were synthesized according to Krieg and Melton (23Krieg P.A. Melton D.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 7057-7070Crossref PubMed Scopus (1081) Google Scholar). α1 cRNA (3 ng) was co-injected with β1a (1 ng) and α2δ (1 ng) subunit cRNAs into stage V–VI oocytes from X. laevis. To exclude effects of endogenous Ca2+-activated Cl− currents kinetic experiments were carried out in oocytes previously injected with 50–100 nl of a 0.1 m1,2-bis-(O-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid (BAPTA) solution. To test for a dominant negative effect, a 20-fold excess of R1279Stop cRNA was co-injected with α1A (0.04 ng) and β1a + α2δ cRNA, and currents were measured 2 days after injection. Whole-cell patch clamp experiments in tsA-201 cells were carried out at room temperature using an Axopatch 200B amplifier (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA). Currents were recorded at sampling rates of 5 or 25 kHz, low-pass filtered at 2 or 5 kHz, and recorded directly onto a personal computer equipped with pCLAMP version 7.0. Borosilicate glass pipettes had a resistance of 2–3 megohms when filled with internal solution. Capacitance and series resistance compensations of 60% were used. Ba2+ currents (I Ba) through Ca2+ channels were measured with the following solutions: pipette solution (in mm): 135 CsCl, 10 Cs-EGTA and 1 MgCl2, adjusted to pH 7.4 with CsOH; bath solution (in mm): 7.5–15 BaCl2, 10 HEPES, 150 choline Cl, and 1 MgCl2, adjusted to pH 7.4 with CsOH. All voltages were corrected for a liquid junction potential of −8 mV. Leak and capacitative currents were recorded using hyperpolarizing pulses. Raw currents were corrected for linear leak currents. Only data from cells with a voltage error <5 mV were analyzed. The voltage dependence of activation was determined from current-voltage (I–V) curves obtained by step depolarizations from a holding potential of −90 mV to various test potentials. I–V curves were fitted according to Equation 1, I=Gmax(V−Vrev)/{1+exp[−(V−V0.5,act)/kact]}Equation 1 where V rev is the extrapolated reversal potential of I Ba; V is the membrane potential; I is the peak current; G max is the maximum conductance of the cell; V 0.5,act is the voltage for half-maximal activation; and k act is the slope factor of the Boltzmann term. Transfected cells were visualized by cotransfection with GFP. Single channel currents were recorded in transfected HEK-293 cells in the cell-attached configuration with a pipette solution containing (in mm) 90 BaCl2, 110 choline chloride, 1 MgCl2, 1 EDTA, 10 HEPES at a pH of 7.4 adjusted with N-methyl-d-glucamine. The bath solution contained (in mm) 110 potassium aspartic acid, 20 KCl, 2 MgCl2, 2 EGTA, 20 HEPES; pH was adjusted to 7.4 with N-methyl-d-glucamine. The pipettes (3–5 megohms) were pulled from borosilicate glass (Clark Electromedical Instruments; Pangbourne, UK) and were coated with Sigmacoat (Sigma). Experiments were performed in a 200-μl perfusion chamber at room temperature. For voltage clamp and current amplification, a EPC-7 amplifier (List, Darmstadt, Germany) was used. Cell-attached patches were clamped at −70 mV and depolarized to test potentials between −20 and +40 mV using a Digidata 1200 Computer Interface (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA) and pClamp software. Signals were low-pass filtered at 1 kHz and digitized with 5 kHz. Idealization of current records and analysis of open probability (P o) were performed with a custom-made software (24Baumgartner W. Hohenthanner K. Hofer G.F. Groschner K. Romanin C. Biophys. J. 1997; 72: 1143-1152Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 25Baumgartner W. Schindler H. Romanin C. J. Neurosci. Methods. 1998; 82: 175-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). 1–6 days after cRNA injection I Ba was measured at 23 °C using the two-microelectrode voltage clamp technique as described previously (26Wappl E. Mitterdorfer J. Glossmann H. Striessnig J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12730-12735Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). To quantify endogenousI Ba oocytes injected only with β1a and α2δ were analyzed in parallel experiments (“control”). Only α1-injected oocytes expressing peak I Baexceeding the highest endogenous currents by at least 3-fold were included into analysis. Data analysis and acquisition were performed by using the pClamp software package (version 6.0, Axon Instruments). Leakage correction was performed by adjusting the current traces by a factor calculated from the difference between the leak at −80 and −90 mV, respectively. The voltage recording and current-injecting microelectrodes were filled with 2.8 m CsCl, 0.2 m CsOH, 10 mmHEPES, and 10 mm EGTA (adjusted to pH 7.4 with HCl) and had resistances of 0.7–6 megohms. The extracellular solution contained 40 mm Ba(OH)2, 50 mm NaOH, 2 mm CsOH, and 5 mm HEPES (pH adjusted to 7.4 with methanesulfonic acid). The voltage dependence of activation was determined from I—V curves as described for patch clamp experiments. Holding potential was −80 mV. Inactivation during depolarization was estimated during 3-s pulses from a holding potential of −80 mV to a test potential 10 mV positive to the peak potential (V max) of the I–V relations of the respective cell. Traces were fit to a biexponential decay yielding time constants for the fast (τfast) and slow (τslow) component and the contribution of the fast component (%τfast). Inactivation during pulse trains was determined by applying 1-Hz trains of 15 100-ms pulses to the V max from a holding potential of −60 and −80 mV, respectively. Recovery of I Ba from inactivation was studied using a double-pulse protocol. After a 3-s depolarizing prepulse from holding potential −80 mV to V max, the time course of I Ba recovery was determined at −60 mV by applying 300-ms test pulses to Vmax at various time intervals after the prepulse. Peak I Ba was normalized to the peak current amplitude measured during the prepulse.I Ba was then allowed to recover for 1 min at −100 mV. This double-pulse protocol was repeated individually for each recovery time interval in the same oocyte. The time course of recovery was fit to a biexponential decay yielding time constants for the fast (τfast) and slow (τslow) component and the contribution of the fast component (%τfast). The voltage dependence of inactivation (steady state inactivation, holding potential −80 mV) was estimated from normalized inward currents elicited during steps to V max after 10-s steps to various holding potentials (conditioning pulses). The half-maximal voltage for steady state inactivation (V 0.5,inact) and the slope factor of the curve (k inact) were obtained by fitting the data to the Boltzmann equation. Experiments were carried out as described (27Pichler M. Cassidy T.N. Reimer D. Haase H. Kraus R. Ostler D. Striessnig J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13877-13882Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) using a sequence-directed antibody (anti-α1A1141–1156) against a synthetic peptide corresponding to residues 1141–1156 of the rabbit α1A sequence (GenBankTM accession number X57477 (28Mori Y.

Statistical significance was determined by unpaired Student's t test (or Mann-WhitneyU test as indicated). Data were analyzed using Clampfit (Axon Instruments), Origin® 5.0 (Microcal), and Statistica® (StatSoft Inc). We have recently shown that even small structural changes in Ca2+ channel α1 subunits can dramatically affect α1 protein expression levels after heterologous expression in tsA-201 cells (21Koschak A. Reimer D. Huber I. Grabner M. Glossmann H. Engel J. Striessnig J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22100-22106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). As we tested the possibility of a complete loss of function in our α1A EA-2 mutant constructs (Fig.1 A), we first demonstrated that our mutants are efficiently expressed on the protein level (Fig.1 B). Next we investigated whether the mutant α1 subunits can form functional channels after heterologous expression in tsA-201 cells andX. laevis oocytes. Fig.2 A illustrates that G293R, but not AY1593/1594D and R1279Stop, yielded functional channels in transfected tsA-201 cells. The lack of expression of these two constructs was confirmed in three independent transfection experiments in which robust I Ba through G293R was always obtained. The G293R mutation significantly (p < 0.001, Mann-Whitney-U test, legend to Fig. 2) reduced expression density to 46% of wild type levels (α1A, 129 ± 19 pA/pF,n = 28; G293R, 59 ± 13 pA/pF, n = 27) and shifted the I–V relationship to more positive voltages. To confirm the reduction of current density by G293R and to test whether functional expression of AY1593/1594D and R1279Stop could be accomplished in a different heterologous expression system, cRNAs of all three constructs were injected into X. laevis oocytes. The appearance of channel currents was then quantified by two-electrode voltage clamp 1–6 days after injection. As in tsA-201 cells, noI Ba exceeding the endogenous oocyte Ca2+ channel current was detected in R1279Stop-injected oocytes (I Ba < 350 nA, n = 50). I Ba density for G293R was also significantly (p < 0.01, Fig. 2 B) smaller, and the I–V relationship was again shifted to more positive voltages by about 6 mV (Table I). Note that higher Ba2+ concentrations than in tsA-201 cells (40versus 7.5–15 mm, legend to Fig. 2) were employed in oocyte experiments causing an overall shift of the I–V relationship to more positive potentials for both mutant and WT α1A currents. In contrast to tsA-201 cells, significantI Ba through AY1593/1594D could be measured in oocytes. AY1593/1594D-injected cells expressedI Ba that significantly exceeded the amplitudes measured for endogenous currents (p < 0.001, Fig.2 B). This was observed in 10 of 22 independent injections.Table IEffects of mutations on activation and inactivation properties in channels expressed in X. laevis oocytesα1 subunitV 0.5, actk actnV 0.5, inactk inactnWT8.9 ± 0.8−3.2 ± 0.119−15.9 ± 0.86.4 ± 0.218G293R14.8 ± 0.71-ap < 0.01, statistically significant difference to WT.−3.5 ± 0.312−14.7 ± 0.97.1 ± 0.210AY1593/1594D14.5 ± 1.91-ap < 0.01, statistically significant difference to WT.−5.0 ± 0.31-ap < 0.01, statistically significant difference to WT.8−14.2 ± 2.28.3 ± 0.61-ap < 0.01, statistically significant difference to WT.7The half-maximal voltage for activation (V 0.5, act), the steepness of the curve at V 0.5, act(k act), the half-maximal voltage for steady-state inactivation (V 0.5, inact), and the steepness of the curve at V 0.5, inact (k inact) were obtained by fitting the data to the Boltzmann equation.

Data are means ± S.E. A detailed characterization of the biophysical properties was carried out in oocytes because both mutants could be expressed and compared in this system. Like G293R, theV 0.5,act of AY1593/1594D was also significantly shifted to more positive voltages by about 6 mV compared with WT α1A (p < 0.01, Table I). Both mutations accelerated voltage-dependent inactivation by decreasing the fast and slow time constant of the biexponential decay ofI Ba and by enhancing the contribution of the fast component (Fig. 3, A andB). The faster inactivation could also explain the more pronounced decay of peak G293R and AY1593/1594DI Ba during rapid pulse trains. After 15 100-ms pulses applied at 1 Hz (holding potential −60 mV),I Ba through WT subunits was reduced by 18%, whereas a 26–28% decrease was found for the mutants (Fig.4). A significant difference was also found at a more negative holding potential (−80 mV, legend to Fig. 4). The stability of I Ba in oocytes also facilitated measurements of the time course of recovery from inactivation (Fig.5) using the double-pulse protocol described under “Experimental Procedures.” Whereas G293R currents recovered with biexponential kinetics similar to WT, AY1593/1594D recovery was significantly slower mainly due to a decreased contribution of the fast recovering component (Fig. 5 B). The half-maximal voltage for steady state inactivation (V 0.5,inact) was not changed by the mutations (Table I).Figure 4Mutations accelerateI Ba decay during trains of pulses. A, 1-Hz trains of 15 100-ms pulses were applied from a holding potential of −60 mV to a test potential corresponding toV max. Peak currents during each pulse were normalized to the peak I Ba during the first pulse (control) and are plotted against pulse number. Data are shown as means ± S.E., n = 9–22.

Metabolism of l-nucleoside analog diphosphates to the triphosphates, however, remains unexplored. Studies with recombinant nm23-H1 and -H2 isoforms indicated that l-nucleoside analog diphosphates were not phosphorylated by their nucleoside diphosphate kinase (NDPK) activity. Therefore, roles of creatine kinase, 3-phosphoglycerate kinase, and pyruvate kinase were evaluated using preparations from commercial sources and human HepG2 cells. Phosphorylation of l-OddC, l-SddC,l-Fd4C, l-FMAU, and l-ddC were compared with d-deoxynucleoside analogs, AraC, dFdC, andd-FMAU, and d-dideoxynucleoside analogs, ddC and d4T. Results based on preparations from HepG2 cells showed thatl-nucleoside analog diphosphates were selectively phosphorylated by 3-phosphoglycerate kinase, whereas,d-deoxynucleoside analog diphosphates were phosphorylated by NDPK. Interestingly, ddCDP and d4TDP were substrates for creatine kinase, but were not phosphorylated by NDPK. In conclusion, it is proposed that specificity of the phosphorylating enzymes toward the nucleoside analog diphosphates is dependent on the configuration of the analog (l or d) and the presence or absence of 3′-hydroxyl group in the sugar moiety.

The last step of phosphorylation is of potential importance, because analogs like l-Fd4C,l-OddC, l-SddC, and ddC accumulate in the cells as diphosphate metabolites indicating inefficiency of the responsible enzyme (6Zhu Y.-L.

Activities of nm23-H7 and nm23-H8 in terms of nucleoside diphosphate phosphorylation are not known (NCBI accession numbers Q9Y5B8 and XP_004705, respectively). NDPKs utilize ATP or other nucleoside triphosphates as a phosphate donor and transfer the phosphate residue onto nucleoside diphosphate via a phosphohistidine intermediate (ping-pong mechanism) (32Lecroisey A. Lascu I. Bominaar A. Véron M. Delepierre M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 12445-12450Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 33Morera S. Chiadmi M. LeBras G. Lascu I. Janin J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11062-11070Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Other enzymes that are capable of phosphorylating nucleoside diphosphates are creatine kinase, 3-phosphoglycerate kinase, pyruvate kinase, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, and adenylosuccinate kinase (34Miller W.H. Miller R.L. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1982; 31: 3879-3884Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 35Miller W.H. Daluge S.M. Garvey E.P. Hopkins S. Reardon J.E. Boyd F.L. Miller R.L. J. Biol.

Based on the high rates of hydrolysis of the phosphate bonds of the donor compounds such as creatine phosphate with ΔGequal to −43 kJ/mol, 1,3-biphosphoglycerate with ΔG equal to −49 kJ/mol, and phosphoenolpyruvate with ΔG equal to −62 kJ/mol (37Mathews C.K. van Holde K.E. Carbohydrate Metabolism I: Biochemistry, 2nd Ed. The Benjamin/Cumming Publishing Company, Inc., Menlo Park, CA1996: 446-474Google Scholar), the enzymes, creatine kinase, 3-phosphoglycerate kinase, and pyruvate kinase, were also examined as potential enzymes for the phosphorylation of nucleoside analog diphosphates. Creatine kinases are dimeric enzymes existing as three isoforms that are designated muscle type (MM), brain type (BB) and hybrid type (MB). These enzymes utilize creatine phosphate as a phosphate donor to convert ADP to ATP (38Bais R. Edwards J.B. CRC Crit. Rev. Clin. Lab. Sci. 1982; 16: 291-335Crossref Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The predominant role of creatine kinase is to generate creatine, which is used by myofibrils during muscular contraction. Pyruvate kinase is a tetramer that exists as three major isoforms named M1, M2, and L. The l-isoform is an allosteric enzyme requiring fructose 1,6-diphosphate as a co-factor and is known to be predominant in the liver (39Imamura K. Taniuchi K. Tanaka T. J. Biochem. 1972; 72: 1001-1015Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 40Farrar G. Farrar W.W. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1995; 27: 1145-1151Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Pyruvate kinase is a glycolytic enzyme that transfers a phosphate group onto ADP using phosphoenolpyruvate as a phosphate donor (37Mathews C.K. van Holde K.E. Carbohydrate Metabolism I: Biochemistry, 2nd Ed. The Benjamin/Cumming Publishing Company, Inc., Menlo Park, CA1996: 446-474Google Scholar, 39Imamura K. Taniuchi K. Tanaka T. J. Biochem. 1972; 72: 1001-1015Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). 3-Phosphoglycerate kinase is a monomeric glycolytic enzyme that exists as a single isoform in most tissues (41Krietsch W.K.G. Frier I.U. Eber S.W. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1979; 198: 415-421Crossref Scopus (6) Google Scholar, 42Joao C. Williams J.P. Biochemistry. 1993; 216: 1-18Google Scholar). It catalyzes transfer of a phosphate group onto ADP using 1,3-biphosphoglycerate as a phosphate donor (43Johnson P.E. Abbott S.J. Orr G.A. Semerira M. Knowles J.R. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 2893-2901Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). For the purpose of this study, the diphosphates of the nucleoside analogs shown in Fig. 1 have been categorized into three groups:l-nucleoside analogs, l-ddC,l-OddC, l-SddC, l-Fd4C, andl-FMAU; d-nucleoside analogs with 3′-hydroxyl group, dCyd, AraC, dFdC (gemcitabine), and FMAU; andd-nucleoside analogs lacking the 3′-hydroxyl group, ddC, and d4T. This study compares the conversion of diphosphates of these analogs to triphosphates by different cellular enzymes. Since the role of l-nucleoside analogs has been implicated in the treatment of hepatitis B infections, which can also lead to progressive liver disease, studies have focused on phosphorylation ofl-nucleoside analogs by enzymes isolated from HepG2 cells. Monophosphate nucleoside analogs were synthesized according to the procedure published by Ruth and Cheng (44Ruth J.L. Cheng Y.C. Mol. Pharmacol. 1981; 20: 415-422PubMed Google Scholar). Diphosphates of nucleoside analogs were synthesized enzymatically by the action of recombinant cytidine monophosphate kinase or thymidine monophosphate kinase, using GTP as a phosphate donor. Nucleoside monophosphates and diphosphates were separated using DEAE Sephadex A-25 (Amersham Biosciences, Inc., Uppsala, Sweden) eluted with step gradients between 0 and 200 mm KCl. GDP, generated subsequent to phosphate transfer, does not co-migrate with dCyd analog diphosphates during chromatographic purification (unlike ADP); therefore, GTP was used as a phosphate donor instead of ATP. Total RNA was extracted from KB cells (human epidermoid carcinoma cell line), using RNAzol (Tel-Test, Inc., Friendswood, TX) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Aliquots of total RNA (20 μg) were reverse-transcribed in the presence of SuperScript RNase H-reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen, Rockville, MD). The reactions were incubated at 37 °C followed by incubation at 96 °C for 5 min to stop the reaction. cDNA was purified by passing through CHROMA SPIN-10 (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) to remove unincorporated nucleotides and oligo-dT primer. An aliquot of cDNA was amplified in the presence of DNA polymerase PWO (Roche Diagnostic Corp., Indianapolis, IN) and specific primers for nm23-H1 and nm23-H2. The sequence for sense and antisense primers for nm23-H1 were as follows: 5′-GGG GCA GCC ATA TGG CCA ACT GTG AGC GTA CCT TC and 3′-CGT GGG CCA TAT GGC CTC ATT CAT AGA TCC AGT TCT GAG C. The primers for nm23-H2 were 5′-CGG CAG CCA TAT GGC CAA CCT GGA GCG CAC C and 3′-CGT GGG CCA TAT GTC ATT ATT CAT AGA CCC AGT CAT G. The PCR product was digested with the restriction enzyme NdeI and gel-purified using the Qiagen PCR purification kit (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA). The resulting cDNA fragment was ligated to NdeI-digested pET28a bacterial expression vector. The sequences of nm23-H1 and -H2 were confirmed by DNA sequencing. The resulting pET28a-H1 and -H2 were N-terminal histidine fusion proteins. All the buffers contained 50 mm Tris acetate (pH 7.5), 5 mm MgCl2, 4 mmGTP, 5 mm NaF, and 5 mm DTT. NDPK activity was measured in the buffer containing 4 mm GTP as a phosphate donor. GTP was chosen as a phosphate donor based on its differential separation from dCyd metabolites upon analysis by high performance liquid chromatography. Creatine kinase activity was measured in the buffer containing 20 mm creatine phosphate as a phosphate donor. Pyruvate kinase activity was measured in a buffer containing 100 mm KCl with 2.5 mm phosphoenolpyruvate as a phosphate donor. For reactions including pyruvate kinase from HepG2 cells, 1 mm fructose 1,6-diphosphate was added as a co-factor. 3-Phosphoglycerate kinase activity was measured using coupled reactions in a buffer containing 10 mm sodium phosphate, 4 mm NAD+, and 4 mmdl-glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate. 1,3-Biphosphoglycerate, which is the phosphate donor for the reaction, was generated 20 min prior to inclusion of 3-phosphoglycerate kinase, by addition of 8 units/ml glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. Indicated concentrations of nucleoside diphosphate analogs served as phosphate acceptors. Some of the studies included the commercial enzymes, creatine kinase (type I from rabbit muscle, Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO), pyruvate kinase (type II from rabbit muscle, Sigma), and 3-phosphoglycerate kinase (from yeast, Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Germany). Lack of phosphorylation in the absence of the phosphate donor served as the positive control for the reactions. All samples were incubated at 37 °C, and the reactions were stopped on ice and followed by trichloroacetic acid precipitation of the protein for 5 min. The samples were extracted in a mixture of trioctylamine and 1,1,2-trichlorotrifluoroethane in a ratio of 45:55. Phosphorylation of nucleoside diphosphate analogs was analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography (Shimadzu, Braintree, MA), in a binary gradient of water and potassium phosphate buffer using an anion exchange column (Partisil-SAX, Whatman, Inc., Clifton, NJ). HepG2 cells (human liver carcinoma) were cultured and grown in nude mice to obtain a higher yield of protein than with conventional cell culture. The isolated cells (filtered to remove connective tissue) were treated to hypotonic shock to remove any residual red blood cells from HepG2 cells. These cells were then suspended and lysed by repeated freeze-thawing in a buffer containing 10 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 5 mm DTT, 5 mm NaF, 15 mmMgCl2, 20 mm KCl, and 10 μg/ml each of leupeptin, pepstatin A, and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The lysate was centrifuged at 17,000 × g for 20 min. The crude extract was then subjected to purification on Blue Sepharose CL6B column (Amersham Biosciences, Inc., Uppsala, Sweden). The elution buffer contained 50 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 1 mmEDTA, 20 mm KCl, 5 mm DTT, 5 mmNaF, and 10 μg/ml of leupeptin, pepstatin A, and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride in 10% glycerol. All the other buffers for elution of the respective enzymes were prepared in the elution buffer. Subsequent to the passage of crude extract through the column, 45 ml of the elution buffer was passed through the column to assist in the removal of poorly bound proteins. This was followed by elution with the following: (i) 45 ml of 5 mm 3-phosphoglycerate, a substrate for 3-phosphoglycerate kinase; (ii) 60 ml of 0–5 mm ADP gradient, because ADP is a natural substrate for all these kinases; (iii) 45 ml of 0.05–0.5 m KCl gradient, to elute some bound proteins; (iv) 30 ml of elution buffer containing 0.5m KCl, 1 mm phosphoenolpyruvate and 1 mm fructose 1,6-diphosphate, which are substrates and co-factors for pyruvate kinase, respectively; (v) 30 ml of wash buffer containing 0.5 m KCl and 1 mm ADP, to elute tightly bound proteins; and (vi) 45 ml of 0.5–2 m KCl gradient, to completely elute the rest of the proteins bound to the column. The eluents were collected in 1.5-ml fractions, and the entire procedure was carried out at 4 °C. ATP generated by NDPK and creatine kinase, using GTP and creatine phosphate as phosphate donors, respectively, was evaluated by coupling to hexokinase and the glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase system (modified from the procedure published previously (45Hess J.W. Murdock K.J. Natho G.J.W. Am. J. Clin. Pathol. 1968; 50: 89-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar)). The buffer contained 50 mm Tris acetate (pH 7.5), 5 mmMgCl2, 100 mm KCl, 1 mm ADP, 10 mm glucose, 0.8 mm NADP, 5 mm DTT, 5 mm NaF, and 1 mm GTP (for NDPK) or 1 mm creatine phosphate (for creatine kinase). Reduction of NADP by 1 unit of hexokinase/glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase at 2-min intervals was monitored via spectrophotometer at 340 nm (UV 160U, Shimadzu, Braintree, MA). ATP generated by pyruvate kinase, using phosphoenolpyruvate as a donor, was evaluated by coupling to lactate dehydrogenase system. The buffer contained 50 mm Tris acetate (pH 7.5), 5 mm MgCl2, 100 mm KCl, 1 mm ADP, 2.5 mmphosphoenolpyruvate, 1 mm fructose 1,6-diphosphate, 0.15 mm NADH, 5 mm DTT, and 5 mm NaF. Oxidation of NADH by 1 unit of lactate dehydrogenase at 2-min intervals was monitored via spectrophotometer at 340 nm. ADP generated by 3-phosphoglycerate kinase using 3-phosphoglycerate as phosphate acceptor was evaluated by coupling to the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase system (modified from the procedure published previously (43Johnson P.E. Abbott S.J. Orr G.A. Semerira M. Knowles J.R. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 2893-2901Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar)). The buffer contained 80 mm Tris acetate (pH 7.5), 8 mm MgCl2, 1 mm ATP, 10 mm 3-phosphoglycerate, 0.15 mm NADH, 5 mm DTT, and 5 mm NaF. Oxidation of NADH by 1 unit of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase at 2-min intervals was monitored via spectrophotometer at 340 nm. Activity of each enzyme was measured by the conversion of ADP to ATP (or vice versa) in micromoles/min, which is proportional to oxidation or reduction of NADH or NAD (in micromoles) within a period of 1 min, using 6.22 mm−1 cm−1 as the molar extinction coefficient for NADH. HepG2 fractions were pooled based on enzyme activity, and equal volumes were separated on 13% SDS-PAGE. Protein was transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was probed with polyclonal rabbit nm23-H1 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA); the membrane was then stripped (Tris-Cl, pH 6.8, 10% SDS, and 2-mercaptoethanol) and reprobed with monoclonal mouse nm23-H2 antibody (Seikagaku Corp., Tokyo, Japan) then stripped again and reprobed with monoclonal mouse nm23-H6 antibody (a generous gift from Dr. Miyuki Fukushima, Kyowa Hakko Kogyo Co. Ltd., Tokyo Research Laboratories, Japan). Protein bands were detected by chemiluminescence (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Boston, MA). Immunofluorescence microscopy had established that the H1 and H2 isoforms of NDPK proteins were cytosolic (data not shown); therefore, these isozymes were cloned for further studies with nucleoside analog diphosphates. TableI represents phosphorylation of nucleoside analog diphosphates, normalized with respect to the phosphorylation of dCDP. Representative analogs from each category shown in Fig. 1 were used as phosphate acceptors. l-Nucleoside analogs, l-OddCDP,l-SddCDP, and l-Fd4CDP were not phosphorylated by both H1 and H2 enzymes. Moreover, ddCDP was also not a substrate for H1 and H2 enzymes. These results indicated that thed-configuration as well as the 3′-hydroxyl group are important for substrate specificity of nucleoside analogs toward these two NDPKs, which implied that other cellular enzymes might be responsible for phosphorylation of l-nucleoside diphosphates in the cytoplasm. Creatine kinase, 3-phosphoglycerate kinase, and pyruvate kinase are some cellular enzymes that are capable of phosphorylating nucleoside diphosphates in addition to ADP, which is their natural substrate. These enzymes, obtained from commercial sources, had been isolated from rabbit muscle or yeast. Interestingly, 3-phosphoglycerate kinase selectively phosphorylatedl-nucleoside analog diphosphates (3- to 4-fold better), as compared with dCDP. l-Nucleoside analogs were also substrates for pyruvate kinase and, to a lesser extent, for creatine kinase. In addition, ddCDP was phosphorylated only by creatine kinase and pyruvate kinase, which had been isolated from rabbit muscle. Studies with these commercial enzymes indicated significance of configuration on phosphorylation by 3-phosphoglycerate kinase.Table IPhosphorylation of nucleoside analog diphosphates by nm23-H1 and -H2 proteins and enzyme preparations from commercial sourcesNucleoside analog diphosphateH1H2Creatine kinase3-Phosphoglycerate kinasePyruvate kinase%dCyd100100100100100ddC<0.5<0.59.5 ± 2.8<0.52.7 ± 0.07l-OddC<0.5<0.52.9 ± 0.2298.2 ± 36.16.6 ± 0.8l-SddC<0.5<0.51.2 ± 0.3403.6 ± 19.63.7 ± 0.01l-Fd4C<0.5<0.5<0.5363.6 ± 59.6<0.5All analogs were tested at a fixed concentration of 200 μm. dCDP was used as a substrate for comparison; therefore, its conversion to dCTP is considered to be 100%.

The values that are <0.5% are based on the allowance for the sensitivity of detection of nucleoside analog triphosphates by HPLC. Values are mean ± S.D. from at least three independent experiments. As severall-nucleoside analogs are important for the treatment of hepatitis B infection, the metabolism of these analogs in liver cells is of potential interest. Therefore, HepG2 cells were selected for isolation of nucleoside diphosphate-metabolizing enzymes, using a Blue Sepharose CL6B affinity column. The isolation profile of the enzymes that were identified is shown in Fig. 2. 3-Phosphoglycerate kinase was eluted in the wash buffer using its substrate 3-phosphoglycerate. Some activities of creatine kinase (CK-I) and NDPK (NDPK-I) were eluted in 20 mm KCl with a 0 to 5 mm ADP gradient. During previous attempts to isolate these enzymes from human fetal liver, 2P. Krishnan and Y. C. Cheng, unpublished observations. activities of pyruvate kinase, NDPK, and creatine kinase were not eluted with a buffer containing up to 0.5 m KCl, however, they had co-eluted in a buffer containing KCl between 0.5 and 2 m. The elution procedure was therefore modified and the column was instead washed with a KCl gradient between 0.05 and 0.5 m to remove unwanted cellular proteins. This was followed by elution with 1 mm phosphoenolpyruvate and 1 mm fructose 1,6-diphosphate, which are substrates and co-factors for pyruvate kinase, respectively, in a buffer containing 0.5 m KCl. Interestingly, some activities of NDPK (NDPK-II) and creatine kinase (CK-II) were also co-eluted with pyruvate kinase. Subsequent elution with 1 mm ADP in a buffer containing 0.5 m KCl isolated another NDPK (NDPK-III) enzyme activity. Activity of the enzyme has been defined as the amount of enzyme required to phosphorylate 1 μmol of ADP to ATP in 1 min. The total activity (derived from Fig. 2), as well as the specific activity of each enzyme in the crude extract, and the blue Sepharose fractions, were evaluated using ADP or ATP as a substrate, and these values are shown in Table II. The blue Sepharose fractions were pooled on the basis of activity; fractions 8–11, 66–70, 75–79, 115–118, and 144–147 contain 3-phosphoglycerate kinase, CK-I, NDPK-I, NDPK-II (pyruvate kinase and CK-II), and NDPK-III, respectively. 3-Phosphoglycerate kinase was purified 920-fold, and NDPKs I and III were purifie"

These studies suggested that polyamines act at the termination step of uORF translation. In this paper, we demonstrate that elevated polyamines stabilize an intermediate in the termination process, the complete nascent peptide linked to the tRNA that decodes the final codon. The peptidyl-tRNA molecule is found associated with the ribosome fraction, and decay of this molecule correlated with release of the paused ribosome from the message. Furthermore, the stability of this complex is influenced by the same parameters that influence regulation by the uORF in vivo, namely the concentration of polyamines and the sequence of the uORF-encoded peptide. These results suggest that the regulated step in uORF translation is after formation of the peptidyl-tRNA molecule but before hydrolysis of the peptidyl-tRNA bond.

AdoMetDC catalyzes the decarboxylation of S-adenosylmethionine, generating the n-propylamine donor for the conversion of putrescine to spermidine and spermidine to spermine. These polyamines are required for cell growth and have been implicated in many cellular processes including DNA replication, transcription, and translation (1Marton L.J. Morris D.R. McCann P.

This peptide seems to act in cis on the mRNA that produced it, and features of the carboxyl-terminal sequence are of particular importance (4Mize G.J. Ruan H.J. Low J.J. Morris D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32500-32505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 6Hill J.R. Morris D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 726-731Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Saturation mutagenesis of the last three codons of the uORF demonstrated that only aspartic acid is tolerated in the fourth position and only the isoleucine homologue, valine, can substitute in the fifth position (4Mize G.J. Ruan H.J. Low J.J. Morris D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32500-32505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The specific structural requirements of the fourth and fifth amino acids are demonstrated by the fact that glutamic acid does not fully substitute for aspartic acid, and substitution of isoleucine with another homologue, leucine, completely abolishes regulation (4Mize G.J. Ruan H.J. Low J.J. Morris D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32500-32505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). These studies imply a precise interaction between the MAGDIS peptide and its regulatory target. In one model of AdoMetDC regulation, polyamines could act to modulate an interaction of the fourth and fifth amino acids of the peptide product of the AdoMetDC uORF with a component of the translational apparatus, such as the peptidyltransferase center of the ribosome or a termination factor. This interaction could inhibit a step in translation such as chain termination or peptide release, causing the ribosome to stall over the termination codon. The stalled ribosome could then block scanning of additional ribosomes and suppress translation of the associated downstream cistron. In agreement with this model, a ribosome was found paused in the vicinity of the uORF termination codon (7Law G.L. Raney A. Morris D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38036-38043Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Elevated polyamine levels increased the stability of the paused ribosome, whereas alterations in the critical fourth and fifth residues of the peptide sequence eliminated this effect of polyamines (7Law G.L.

Although these studies clearly demonstrated a polyamine-enhanced stalling of the ribosome in the vicinity of the termination codon of the wild-type AdoMetDC uORF, they did not establish the identity of the rate-limiting step that produced the ribosome stall. In this paper we describe the presence of an intermediate in the uORF termination process, the complete nascent peptide linked to the tRNA that decodes the final codon. This complex is associated with the ribosome and is stabilized by elevated polyamine levels. Alterations in the critical fourth and fifth residues of the nascent peptide eliminate this stabilization. These results are consistent with a regulated translation termination mechanism for the AdoMetDC uORF, with the regulated step being at or just prior to hydrolysis of the peptidyl-tRNA bond. Details of plasmid construction andin vitro synthesis of capped mRNAs were described previously (5Raney A. Baron A.C. Mize G.J. Law G.L. Morris D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24444-24450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Wheat germ extract was prepared as described previously (8Anderson C.W. Straus J.W. Dudock B.S.

Wheat germ translation reactions were performed, as described previously (5Raney A. Baron A.C. Mize G.J. Law G.L. Morris D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24444-24450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), with the exceptions that no bestatin was added to translation mixtures, and the samples were incubated 20 min at 26 °C instead of at room temperature. The concentration of endogenous polyamines in the wheat germ translation reactions is ∼40–70 μm spermidine, 15–25 μm spermine, and no detectable putrescine (5Raney A. Baron A.C. Mize G.J. Law G.L. Morris D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24444-24450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Additional spermidine (Sigma) was added to the reactions as indicated under “Results.” A procedure described previously (11Enriquez J.A. Attardi G. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 264: 183-196Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) for detection of aminoacyl tRNAs was adapted for this purpose. Reactions (25 μl) were terminated by addition of 235 μl of pH 5.0 buffer (0.1 msodium acetate, 0.5 m sodium chloride, 1 mmEDTA, 1% SDS) and 260 μl of phenol equilibrated with the same solution but without EDTA. The aqueous layer (200 μl) was precipitated with 3 volumes of ethanol and 0.067 volume of 3m sodium acetate, pH 5.2. Precipitates were washed with 75% ethanol containing 10 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.2, and resuspended in 6 μl of acid resuspension buffer, pH 5.0 (10 mm sodium acetate, 1 mm EDTA). Acid loading buffer, pH 5.0 (9 μl; 0.1 m sodium acetate, 7m urea, 0.05% bromphenol blue, 0.05% xylene cyanol), was added, and samples were electrophoresed on an acid urea gel, pH 5.0 (0.1 m sodium acetate, 6.5% acrylamide, 7 murea), at 500 V for 7 h at 4 °C. 35S-Labeled bands were quantitated using the STORM PhosphorImager system and ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). The intensity values of the 35S-peptidyl-tRNAs were adjusted for recovery by normalizing to the summed intensities of the35S-Met-tRNAMet bands. In control experiments, the intensities of the 35S-Met-tRNAMet bands were not influenced by spermidine concentration or by the sequence of the uORF-encoded peptide (data not shown). For RNase A digestion, extracted and precipitated wheat germ translation reactions were resuspended in 100 μl of Tris-EDTA, pH 7.0. RNase A (10 μg; Sigma) was added, and samples were incubated for 15 min at 37 °C. For proteinase K treatment, reactions were resuspended in 100 μl of 1% SDS, and after addition of proteinase K (20 μg; Sigma), samples were incubated for 60 min at 37 °C. For alkaline treatments, samples were resuspended either in 100 μl of 0.3 m KOH and incubated for 60 min at room temperature or in 0.5 m Tris-HCl, pH 9.0, and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. Untreated controls were resuspended in 100 μl of 10 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.2, and incubated for 60 min on ice. Peptidyl-tRNA complexes were isolated as described above. Ethanol precipitates were resuspended in 100 μl of 0.5 mTris-HCl, pH 9.0, and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C to hydrolyze the peptidyl-tRNA bond (12McClain W.H. Jou Y.Y. Bhattacharya S. Gabriel K. Schneider J. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 290: 391-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Unlabeled synthetic carrier peptides (30 nmol), with the sequences MAGDIS (Alpha Diagnostic, San Antonio, TX), MAGEIS, MAGDVS, MAGDLS, or MAGDI (United Biochemical Research, Inc., Seattle, WA), were added to samples as indicated. Peptides were purified by addition of 900 μl of water containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, followed by C18 column chromatography using Sep-Pak Light C18 Cartridges (Waters Associates) as per the manufacturer's instructions. The purified peptides were resolved on thin layer chromatography plates as described previously (5Raney A. Baron A.C. Mize G.J. Law G.L. Morris D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24444-24450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). After incubation, three 50-μl reactions were combined to give a total volume of 150 μl. Ice-cold buffer (350 μl; 10 mm magnesium acetate, 20 mm potassium acetate, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, and 1 mm dithiothreitol) was added, followed by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 90 min at 4 °C using a Beckman TL 100 centrifuge and a TLA 45 rotor (Beckman Instruments, Fullerton, CA). Ribosome-containing pellets were resuspended in 500 μl of pH 5.0 buffer (0.1 m sodium acetate, 0.5 m sodium chloride, 1 mm EDTA, 1% SDS), and the pellet and supernatant fractions were analyzed for35S-peptidyl-tRNA and35S-Met-tRNAMet (see above) or for rRNA and tRNA by ethidium bromide staining of a formaldehyde-agarose gel. The primer extension assay with reverse transcriptase was performed as described previously using the 32P-labeled LL16 primer (7Law G.L. Raney A. Morris D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38036-38043Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Capped transcripts of the AdoMetDC 5′ leader containing the wild-type uORF (Fig. 1) were synthesized and incubated in wheat germ translation mixtures with [35S]methionine and 750 μm spermidine. This elevated concentration of spermidine led to reduced accumulation of the final peptide product from the wild-type uORF compared with altered derivatives (5Raney A. Baron A.C. Mize G.J. Law G.L. Morris D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24444-24450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Peptidyl-tRNA complexes were recovered from the translation mixtures as described under “Experimental Procedures” using a procedure that was initially developed to separate charged and uncharged forms of tRNA species (11Enriquez J.A. Attardi G. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 264: 183-196Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Enriquez J.A. Attardi G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8300-8305Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). At all steps during the process, care was taken to avoid hydrolysis of the peptidyl-tRNA bond, which included maintaining a pH < 7.0 and a temperature < 37 °C. By using this procedure, multiple intensely labeled bands were observed in translation samples (Fig. 2, lanes 3–6; marked with bracket). Because these bands do not co-migrate with [35S]methionine (lanes 1 and2), and because they are present in samples lacking added mRNA (lanes 3 and 4), they are thought to contain charged initiator 35S-Met-tRNAMet and elongator 35S-Met-tRNAMet species (see below for further evidence). In translation samples containing the wild-type AdoMetDC uORF, a slower migrating (less intensely labeled) band was detected (lanes 5 and 6, arrow).Figure 2In vitro formation of a complex migrating more slowly than Met-tRNA. In vitrotranslation reactions containing [35S]methionine and 750 μm spermidine were carried out with no added mRNA (lanes 3 and 4) or with capped transcripts of the AdoMetDC 5′ leader containing the wild-type uORF sequence (lanes 5 and 6). After translation, reactions were extracted with phenol and precipitated with ethanol under acid conditions. Resuspended samples were electrophoresed on an acid urea gel for 7 h at 4 °C. In lanes 3–6, a bracket is used to mark the migration of multiple intensely labeled bands, and anarrow is used to mark the migration of a slower migrating band. Lanes 1 and 2 contain 55.4 μCi of [35S]methionine only.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To characterize the [35S]methionine-containing bands,in vitro translation reactions containing the wild-type uORF and 750 μm spermidine were extracted, precipitated, resuspended in suitable buffers, and subjected to various treatments (Fig. 3 A). Treatment with RNase A completely eliminated all of the 35S-containing bands (compare lanes 2 and 3). Treatment of samples with proteinase K eliminated the slower migrating band but not the multiple intensely labeled bands (lane 4). All of the bands were eliminated by treatment with 0.3 m KOH (lane 5) or 0.5 m Tris-HCl, pH 9.0 (data not shown), whereas none of the bands was eliminated by treatment with DNase I (not shown). Overall, these results are consistent with the multiple intensely labeled bands containing35S-Met-tRNAMet species and the slowest migrating species containing a 35S-labeled peptide linked to an RNA molecule. To determine whether formation of the putative35S-peptidyl-RNA complex requires ongoing translation, samples containing the wild-type uORF and 750 μmspermidine were incubated with various translation inhibitors (Fig.3 B). Treatment with cycloheximide or hygromycin, which inhibit ribosome translocation and promote ribosome arrest at or near the start site of a message (14Munro H.N. Baliga B.S. Pronczuk A.W. Nature. 1968; 219: 944-946Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 15Baliga B.S. Pronczuk A.W. Munro H.N. J. Biol.

Cell. 2000; 103: 1143-1154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (711) Google Scholar), prevented formation of the35S-peptidyl-RNA complex, but not the faster migrating35S-Met-tRNAMet species (compare lanes 2 and 3 to lane 1). Treatment of samples with puromycin and edeine produced similar results (lanes 4and 5). Puromycin acts by replacing aminoacyl tRNA as the acceptor in the peptidyltransferase reaction, causing translation to terminate prematurely and the ribosome to dissociate from the message (19Celma M.L. Monro R.E. Vazquez D. FEBS Lett. 1970; 6: 273-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 20Carrasco L. Fernandez-Puentes C. Vasquez D. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1976; 10: 97-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), whereas edeine interferes with AUG codon recognition by the 43 S preinitiation complex (21Kozak M. Shatkin A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 6568-6577Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Anthony D.D. Merrick W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1554-1562Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, formation of the35S-peptidyl-RNA complex is prevented when either the initiation or elongation steps of translation are inhibited. These results demonstrate that formation of the 35S-peptidyl-RNA complex requires ongoing translation, whereas the35S-Met-tRNAMet species requires only incubation of [35S]methionine with lysate, consistent with the assigned identities of these bands. To establish the identity of the peptide component of the35S-peptidyl-tRNA complex, in vitro translation samples containing the wild-type uORF and 750 μmspermidine were extracted and precipitated as described above. Samples were resuspended in 0.5 m Tris-HCl, pH 9.0, to hydrolyze the peptidyl-tRNA bond (12McClain W.H. Jou Y.Y. Bhattacharya S. Gabriel K. Schneider J. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 290: 391-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). After incubation, the released peptides were purified by C18 reverse phase column chromatography and fractionated by thin layer chromatography (Fig.4). Before the reverse phase column chromatography step, unlabeled synthetic carrier peptides were added, and positions of the carrier peptides on the thin layer chromatography plate were determined by ninhydrin staining (Fig. 4, left panel; lanes 2 and 3, MAGDIS; lane 5, MAGDI; lane 7, MAGEIS). Migration of35S-labeled material on the same thin layer plate was determined by autoradiography (Fig. 4, right panel).Lanes 1, 4, and 6 contained carrier peptides only, without prior C18 chromatography, as a measure of recovery from the purification steps. Comparing the two panels of Fig. 4, the35S-labeled peptide clearly co-migrated with the MAGDIS carrier peptide, the expected product from the uORF. Lane 2contained a reaction that was resuspended in water instead of 0.5m Tris-HCl, pH 9.0, and most of the radioactivity remained at the origin. The absence of the 35S-labeled peptide in this lane indicates that the 35S-labeled peptides identified in lanes 3, 5, and 7 were not contaminants from peptide released during synthesis. These results are consistent with the peptide component of the peptidyl-RNA complex being MAGDIS. To confirm further the identity of the peptidyl-RNA complex, translation reactions were performed containing the wild-type uORF or uORFs with synonymous codon substitutions (Fig. 1). Reactions were extracted and precipitated under acid conditions and electrophoresed on an acid urea gel. In Fig. 5 A, synonymous codon substitutions within the uORF sequence altered the migration of the 35S-peptidyl-RNA complex (comparelanes 2 and 3). This shift in migration was specifically due to alteration of the final serine codon. When the altered UCC serine codon was changed back to the wild-type AGC serine codon (retaining synonymous substitutions in other four codons, see Fig. 1), migration of the 35S-peptidyl-RNA was at the wild-type position (Fig. 5 A, compare lanes 2 and4). Comparing the migration of the 35S-labeled peptides with the ninhydrin-stained bands in Fig. 5 B, it is clear that the peptide component is MAGDIS in all cases. Thus, the difference in mobility observed in Fig. 5 A seems to be the result of different wheat tRNASer species recognizing the AGC and UCC serine codons. In vitro translation reactions were carried out and then centrifuged at 100,000 × g. Pellet and supernatant fractions were extracted and precipitated as described previously and electrophoresed on an acid urea gel. In Fig.6 A,35S-MAGDIS-tRNASer was detected almost exclusively in the pellet (lane 3), whereas the multiple35S-Met-tRNAMet species were highly enriched in the supernatant (lane 2). In contrast, no35S-MAGDIS-tRNASer was present in either fraction in reactions that were incubated with cycloheximide (lanes 5 and 6). The efficiency of ribosome pelleting was monitored by formaldehyde-agarose gel electrophoresis of RNA purified from the same translation mixtures (Fig. 6 B). Although rRNAs were enriched in the pellet fractions (lanes 3 and 6), tRNA was localized in the supernatant fractions (lanes 2 and 5). These results are consistent with the MAGDIS-tRNASer generated in these reactions being associated with the ribosome. Translation reactions, containing the wild-type uORF and either no added spermidine or 750 μm spermidine, were incubated for 20 min. Cycloheximide was then added to inhibit further translation, and incubation was continued for varying lengths of time. A portion of each sample was analyzed for 35S-MAGDIS-tRNASer, and a second portion was subjected to a primer extension inhibition assay to analyze for paused ribosomes as detailed below. In Fig.7 A,35S-MAGDIS-tRNASer (marked by arrow) is seen to disappear after cycloheximide addition. With the assumption that the disappearance of this signal is first order, a semi-log plot of 35S-MAGDIS-tRNASer intensityversus time of incubation after cycloheximide addition is shown in Fig. 7 A (3rd panel). The rate of decay is clearly slowed in the presence of spermidine. Specifically, the half-life of 35S-MAGDIS-tRNASer is calculated to be ∼15 min with spermidine and ∼5 min without. To examine ribosome release from the uORF termination site, a primer extension inhibition assay was used (7Law G.L. Raney A. Morris D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38036-38043Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this assay, after incubation for the indicated time in the presence of cycloheximide, a radiolabeled primer is annealed to the mRNA downstream of the uORF sequence. Reverse transcriptase is added, which extends the primer until it encounters a block, such as a paused ribosome. Reactions are electrophoresed on a denaturing acrylamide gel alongside a sequencing ladder. The precise locations (within one or two nucleotides) of the blocks are determined by comparing the migration of the corresponding extension products with the ladder. Blocks to reverse transcriptase are found at both the uORF initiation and termination sites, and these blocks have been shown to be due to paused ribosomes (7Law G.L. Raney A. Morris D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38036-38043Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The ribosome paused over the termination codon is released from the message after cycloheximide addition (Fig. 7 B), consistent with previous data (7Law G.L. Raney A. Morris D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38036-38043Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The rate of ribosome release is slowed with elevated spermidine, as shown by a semi-log plot of intensity versustime of incubation after cycloheximide addition (3rd panel,Fig. 7 B). Specifically, the half-life of the stalled ribosome is calculated to be ∼17 min with spermidine and ∼6 min without. Interestingly, the rates of ribosome release from the termination site and the rates of35S-MAGDIS-tRNASer decay, as measured in the same reactions, are similar both in the presence and absence of spermidine. A similar observation was made using another translation inhibitor, edeine (data not shown). To determine the effect of peptide sequence on accumulation of peptidyl-tRNA, translation reactions containing 750 μmspermidine were performed either with no added mRNA or with uORFs encoding wild-type or altered peptide products (Fig. 1). It has been shown previously that the stabilities of these mRNAs are identical under these conditions (5Raney A. Baron A.C. Mize G.J. Law G.L. Morris D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24444-24450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In Fig.8 A, comparable35S-peptidyl-tRNA intensities are obtained from reactions with the wild-type uORF (lane 2), a uORF that encodes the wild-type peptide but with synonymous codon substitutions (lane 3), and a uORF encoding the MAGDVS peptide (lane 4). A uORF sequence encoding the MAGDLS peptide demonstrated reduced accumulation of peptidyl-tRNA (∼37% of the wild-type level, lane 6), as did a uORF encoding the MAGEIS peptide (∼60% of the wild-type level,lane 5). Similar results were obtained using three different batches of wheat germ extract and 2–4 different lots of RNA (depending on the particular RNA species). To verify the identity of the35S-peptidyl-tRNAs in Fig. 8 A, the35S-labeled peptide component was hydrolyzed from isolated complexes, combined with the appropriate synthetic carrier peptide, and resolved by thin layer chromatography as described in the legend for Fig. 4. In Fig. 8 B, the 35S-labeled peptides co-migrate with the corresponding ninhydrin-stained peptides. Furthermore, the PhosphorImager intensities of the35S-labeled peptides show the same pattern with regard to uORF sequence as the corresponding 35S-peptidyl-tRNA complexes (compare Fig. 8 A with the 2nd panel of Fig. 8 B). Overall, these results demonstrate that accumulation of peptidyl-tRNA in vitro is influenced by the sequence of the encoded peptide in directions predicted by in vivo studies (23Mize G.J. Morris D.R. RNA (New York). 2001; 7: 374-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) but is not influenced by the precise nucleotide sequence of the uORF. To determine the influence of the sequence of the uORF-encoded peptide on the stability of peptidyl-tRNA, reactions containing 750 μm spermidine were performed with either the wild-type uORF or a uORF encoding the MAGDLS peptide. After 20 min of incubation, cycloheximide was added to inhibit further translation, and samples were incubated for varying lengths of time. After electrophoresis on an acid urea gel, 35S-peptidyl-tRNA species were quantitated by PhosphorImager analyses, and a semi-log plot of intensity versus time of incubation after cycloheximide addition was constructed (Fig.9). The peptidyl-tRNA intensities for both wild-type and altered samples were normalized to the intensity at time 0, which was set at 100. As shown in Fig. 9, the rate of35S-MAGDIS-tRNASer decay was about 3-fold slower than 35S-MAGDLS-tRNASer. Specifically, the half-life of35S-MAGDIS-tRNASer was calculated to be 11 min, whereas the half-life of MAGDLS-tRNASer was 3 min. This slower rate of decay of 35S-MAGDIS-tRNASerwould seem to explain its increased accumulation in reactions in comparison with 35S-MAGDLS-tRNASer(Fig. 8). In a previous study (5Raney A. Baron A.C. Mize G.J. Law G.L. Morris D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24444-24450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), synthesis of the MAGDIS peptide in wheat germ translation reactions was found to be uniquely sensitive to elevated levels of spermidine and spermine in comparison with altered derivatives of this peptide. Under the same conditions where specific inhibition of wild-type peptide synthesis was observed, recent studies (7Law G.L. Raney A. Morris D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38036-38043Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrated a stabilized ribosome paused in the vicinity of the termination codon of the AdoMetDC uORF. These results suggest, but do not prove, that synthesis of the peptide product of the wild-type uORF is inhibited at the termination step by spermine and spermidine. The current study investigates an intermediate in the AdoMetDC uORF termination process, i.e. the complete nascent peptide (MAGDIS) linked to the tRNA species that decodes the last codon (tRNASer). The identification of this intermediate is based on several observations. First, we detected an 35S-labeled compound in translation reactions that was degraded by both proteinase K and RNase A, consistent with the complex containing a peptide and an RNA component. The 35S-labeled peptide component of this complex co-migrated with the MAGDIS peptide on thin layer chromatography plates. Furthermore, a synonymous codon substitution of the last serine codon of the uORF altered the electrophoretic mobility of the complex, suggesting the RNA component is a wheat tRNASer species. Finally, this complex pelleted with the ribosome fraction and was not detectable in reactions incubated with various translation inhibitors, suggesting that it is formed by protein synthesis in association with a ribosome. Accumulation of MAGDIS-tRNASer was influenced by the same parameters that have been demonstrated to regulate AdoMetDC translationin vivo (3Ruan H. Shantz L.M. Pegg A.E. Morris D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29576-29582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 4Mize G.J. Ruan H.J. Low J.J. Morris D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32500-32505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), to influence the rate of peptide synthesis from the AdoMetDC uORF (5Raney A. Baron A.C. Mize G.J. Law G.L. Morris D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24444-24450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), and to stabilize a ribosome paused close to the uORF termination codon (7Law G.L. Raney A. Morris D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38036-38043Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These parameters include polyamine concentration and the sequence of the uORF-encoded peptide, specifically in the critical fourth and fifth residues. In this paper, we found that translation reactions containing elevated concentrations of spermidine led to increased stability of MAGDIS-tRNASer. Accumulation of the peptidyl-tRNA complex also followed the previously defined trend with regard to alterations in the encoded peptide sequence in the critical fourth and fifth residues. For example, alteration of the fifth codon from isoleucine to leucine completely abolished uORF regulation in vivo (4Mize G.J. Ruan H.J. Low J.J. Morris D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32500-32505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 23Mize G.J. Morris D.R. RNA (New York). 2001; 7: 374-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), and this particular alteration also led to instability and reduced accumulation of MAGDLS-tRNASer in comparison with MAGDIS-tRNASer. Similar parallels were demonstrated for other alterations in the encoded peptide sequence, including substitution of valine in the fifth codon (enhanced regulation) and substitution of glutamic acid in the fourth codon (reduced regulation). The peptidyl-tRNA intermediate is stabilized approximately 3-fold by elevated polyamines in the wheat germ extracts studied here. This is similar in magnitude to the regulatory effects observed previously with the AdoMetDC uORF. In drug-treated mammalian cells (3Ruan H. Shantz L.M. Pegg A.E. Morris D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29576-29582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) and starved yeast auxotrophs (23Mize G.J. Morris D.R. RNA (New York). 2001; 7: 374-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), the influence of added polyamines on expression of genes downstream of this uORF is 3–5-fold. In wheat germ extracts (7Law G.L. Raney A. Morris D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38036-38043Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), 2A. Raney, G. L. Law, and D. R. Morris, unpublished results. the influence of added polyamines on translation of genes downstream of the uORF varies from 2- to 5-fold, depending on the particular wheat germ preparation and construct tested. In making these comparisons, it is important to recognize that one is comparing intact polyamine-depleted cells with gel-filtered extracts, and therefore, variables such as the concentrations of residual polyamines, magnesium ion, and monovalent cations are not controlled. Consequently, it is impossible to do more than state that the magnitude of the effect on termination of the AdoMetDC uORF is similar to previous results measuring expression of associated downstream genes. However, the related and perhaps more important question is whether there is any reason to think that there are other sites of polyamine action besides termination, or can the observed regulatory properties be accounted for through the effects on MAGDIS termination? No specific effects of polyamines on initiation of translation of the uORF were observed in our previous studies (7Law G.L. Raney A. Morris D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38036-38043Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The possibility that polyamines exert specific effects on peptide elongation at the uORF has not been tested directly; however, the fact that the sequence-specific properties of the uORF are abolished by extending the length of the coding region at the 3′ end (6Hill J.R.

Therefore, there is no compelling reason at this point to invoke other sites of regulation besides termination at the AdoMetDC uORF. Translation termination in eukaryotes is a multistep process, which includes presentation of the stop codon in the ribosomal A site, binding of eukaryotic release factor 1 (eRF1), hydrolysis of the peptidyl-tRNA bond, followed by dissociation of the ribosome, de-acylated tRNA, and peptide from the mRNA (reviewed in Ref. 24Welch E.M. Wang W. Peltz S.W. Sonenberg N. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Translational Control of Gene Expression. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2000: 467-486Google Scholar). That we detect a peptidyl-tRNA complex and that the stability of this complex is influenced by the same parameters that influence regulation by the uORF in vivo suggest that the regulated step in termination must be after formation of the peptidyl-tRNA molecule but before hydrolysis of the peptidyl-tRNA bond. Consistent with this hypothesis, peptidyl-tRNA decay is correlated temporally with ribosome release from the uORF termination site. If the regulated step were after hydrolysis, perhaps through an effect on ribosome release, then peptidyl-tRNA decay would occur faster than ribosome release. One possible site of regulation could be at the interaction of eRF1 with the ribosome. eRF1 binding could be compromised if the structure of the ribosomal A site were to be altered by an interaction between the nascent peptide, polyamines, and a target in the ribosome or associated factors. Alternatively, eRF1 could bind, but its activity might be compromised. Because eRF1 must act in conjunction with the peptidyltransferase center of the 60 S ribosomal subunit to catalyze the transfer of the nascent peptide chain in the ribosomal P site to a water molecule, the activity of eRF1 could be impaired by interaction of the nascent peptide either with eRF1 directly or alternatively with peptidyltransferase. Another example of a regulatory peptidyl-tRNA molecule that has been identified in eukaryotes is the product of the uORF2 sequence of the human cytomegalovirus gene gpUL4 (25Cao J.H. Geballe A.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 7109-7114Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 26Cao J.H. Geballe A.P. RNA (New York). 1998; 4: 181-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Similar to the situation described for AdoMetDC, accumulation of uORF2-peptidyl-tRNAPro within the ribosome depends on the peptide sequence encoded by the uORF and is associated with a rate-limiting step at uORF2 termination (25Cao J.H. Geballe A.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 7109-7114Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). This is manifested by the stability of a ribosome paused over the uORF2 termination codon (25Cao J.H. Geballe A.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 7109-7114Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar,27Cao J. Geballe A.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 603-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Despite the similarities of the regulatory mechanisms for AdoMetDC and gpUL4, there are a few important differences. Most apparent, the structures of the two uORF-encoded peptides bear no resemblance to one another, suggesting different targets of interaction. In addition, uORF2 termination does not appear to be regulated by a small molecule, as is the case for polyamine regulation of the AdoMetDC uORF (5Raney A. Baron A.C. Mize G.J. Law G.L. Morris D.R.

Finally, studies suggest that the ribosome may be released from the uORF2 termination codon prior to hydrolysis of the peptidyl-tRNAPro bond (26Cao J.H. Geballe A.P. RNA (New York). 1998; 4: 181-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), whereas this seems not to be the case for AdoMetDC. Further studies of both AdoMetDC and gpUL4 transcripts should elucidate the cellular targets of the uORF-encoded peptides, and also the mechanism by which polyamines modulate this regulation in the case of AdoMetDC. Because these two sequence-specific uORFs differ greatly in both size and sequence from each other and also from the sequence-specific uORF associated with the fungal arg-2 (CPA1) gene (summarized in Ref. 28Morris D.R. Geballe A.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8635-8642Crossref PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar), it seems reasonable to postulate that there are multiple targets available in the translational machinery for this class of regulatory mechanisms.

Furthermore, these cells are thought to be capable of reversibly modulating their phenotype during postnatal development (28Mosse P.R. Campbell G.R. Campbell J.H. Atherosclerosis. 1986; 6: 664-669Google Scholar). This phenotypic modulation includes an alteration in the expression of proteins characteristic of the differentiated SM cell and has been implicated in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular (29Ross R. Nature. 1993; 362: 801-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (9910) Google Scholar) and gastrointestinal (30MacDermott R.P. Inflammatory Bowel Disease: Current Status and Future Approaches.

Paradoxically, TGF-β signaling may play a role in directing SM cell responses to disease. TGF-β expression is increased in SM components of the arterial wall following injury (32Majesky M.W. Lindner V. Twurdzik D.R. Schwartz S.M. Reidy M.A. J. Clin. Investig. 1991; 88: 904-910Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar) and of the intestinal mesenchyme in patients with inflammatory bowel diseases (31Neurath M.F. Meyer zumBuschenfelde K.H. J. Investig. Med. 1996; 44: 516-520PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, it has been shown that administration of neutralizing anti-TGF-β antibodies reduces the severity of lesions in carotid injury (33Wolf V.G. Rasmussen L.M. Ruoslahti E. J. Clin. Investig. 1994; 93: 1172-1178Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar) and experimentally induced ulcerative colitis (34Powrie F.T. Immunity. 1995; 3: 171-174Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). The exact mechanism(s) through which TGF-β signaling affects both SM cell differentiation and response to injury or disease is largely unknown. However, it has been demonstrated that TGF-β up-regulates SM-α-actin expression in human and rat SM via direct transcriptional regulation (13Owens G.K. Physiol. Rev. 1995; 75: 487-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (1366) Google Scholar). Interestingly, although SM-α-actin is among the first genes expressed during SM differentiation, it is also expressed during development in a variety of other cell types, including skeletal and cardiac muscle, corneal fibroblasts, and astroglial cells (35Jester J.V. Barry-Lane P.A. Cavanaugh H.D. Petroll W.M. Cornea. 1996; 15: 505-516Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, SM-α-actin expression is modulated by TGF-β in skin and corneal fibroblast during wound repair (35Jester J.V. Barry-Lane P.A. Cavanaugh H.D. Petroll W.M. Cornea. 1996; 15: 505-516Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); hence, the transcriptional control of this gene by TGF-β may not represent a SM-specific event. To gain a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms that regulate genes during SM differentiation, we have analyzed the expression of SM-γ-actin. Although a closely related isoform of SM-α-actin, SM-γ-actin expression is induced at late stages of SM differentiation (36Landerholm T.E. Dong X.-R., Lu, J. Belaguli N.S. Schwartz R.J. Majesky M.W. Development (Camb.). 1999; 126: 2053-2062Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and developmentally restricted to SM in the vasculature and gastrointestinal tract (15Browning C.L. Culberson D.E. Aragon I.V. Fillmore R.A. Croissant J.D. Schwartz R.J. Zimmer W.E. Dev. Biol. 1998; 194: 18-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 47Zimmer W.E. Browning C.L. Kovacs A.M. Dev. Biol. 1996; 175: 399Google Scholar), with the exception of the post-meiotic spermatocyte (37Kim E. Walters S.H. Hule L.E. Hect N.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 1875-1881Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Thus, SM-γ-actin provides an excellent marker for the differentiated SM cell phenotype. Transcriptional regulation of the SM-γ-actin gene appears to require the interaction of positive- and negative-actingcis-elements within the promoter. Two separate regions displaying positive transcriptional activity have been mapped in the SM-γ-actin gene promoter, and are referred to as the specifier and modulator domains (14Kovacs A.M. Zimmer W.E. Gene Expr. 1998; 7: 115-129PubMed Google Scholar). A key cis-element for SM-specific transcription present in both of the positive-acting transcriptional regulatory domains is the CArG/SRE motif. The positive-acting transcriptional activity of the specifier and modulator domains is derived from the binding of SRF to the CArG/SRE motif (CC(A/T)6GG), and we have previously shown that SRF complexes are key regulators of the developmental activation of the SM-γ-actin gene in vivo (15Browning C.L. Culberson D.E. Aragon I.V. Fillmore R.A. Croissant J.D. Schwartz R.J. Zimmer W.E. Dev. Biol. 1998; 194: 18-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Given that CArG/SRE elements are important for TGF-β inducibility of the skeletal and SM-α-actin genes, it is possible that SRF mediates TGF-β induction of SM-γ-actin during SM development. The CArG/SRE motif has been implicated in the developmental regulation of other SM-specific genes as well, including SM-α-actin (38Blank R.S. McQuinn T.C. Yin K.C. Thompson M.M. Takegasa K.

Moreover, SRF expression and function has been developmentally correlated with vascular and visceral SM differentiation in vivo (15Browning C.L. Culberson D.E. Aragon I.V. Fillmore R.A. Croissant J.D. Schwartz R.J. Zimmer W.E. Dev. Biol. 1998; 194: 18-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 36Landerholm T.E. Dong X.-R., Lu, J. Belaguli N.S. Schwartz R.J. Majesky M.W.

In the studies presented here, we examined the regulation of SM-γ-actin expression by TGF-β in 10T1/2 mesenchymal cells, which we have previously shown to serve as SM progenitors (44Hirschi K.K. Rohovsky S.A. D'Amore P.A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 805-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (689) Google Scholar). We demonstrate that TGF-β increased steady-state levels of SM-γ-actin mRNA and induced production and cytoskeletal localization of SM-γ-actin protein. Increased mRNA levels resulted from TGF-β-induced transcriptional activation of the SM-γ-actin gene. This response was mediated through a specific CArG/SRE motif (CArG box 2) within the specifier segment of the promoter, which was found to be necessary for TGF-β-induced transcriptional activation. Furthermore, we show an increase in SRF binding activity upon the SM-γ-actin promoter in response to TGF-β, which was paralleled by increased SRF protein expression. SRF expression was up-regulated by TGF-β via transcriptional and post-transcriptional control mechanisms. Using SM progenitors stably transfected with wild type or dominant-negative SRF, we demonstrated that SRF protein expression is sufficient for induction of a SM phenotype in mesenchymal cells and is necessary for TGF-β-mediated SM induction. 10T1/2 cells (ATCC CCL 226) were grown and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) with 10% fetal bovine serum and 4.5 g/liter glucose and supplemented with penicillin and streptomycin. All cells were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere. For all cell culture experiments, cells were switched to DMEM containing 2% calf serum (DMEM, 2% CS) upon initial cell plating (T o for each experiment); each experiment was repeated at least three times. Representative experiments are shown. 10T1/2 cells were cultured in four-chamber culture slides (Lab-Tek, Naperville, IL) in DMEM, 2% CS ± 1 ng/ml TGF-β1. After incubation for 24 h, the cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and immunostained for SM-γ-actin, as described previously (44Hirschi K.K. Rohovsky S.A. D'Amore P.A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 805-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (689) Google Scholar). Anti-SM-γ-actin (mouse monoclonal antibody, ICN) was used at 1:1000 in blocking buffer consisting of 4% normal goat serum, 3% bovine serum albumin, 0.1% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline. At this concentration, this antibody is specific for the SM-γ-actin isoform and does not cross-react with other prevalent actin isoforms, including SM-α-actin. 2L. Lai and K. K. Hirschi, unpublished observation. Antibody-antigen complexes were visualized using the Vectastain Elite ABC Kit (Vector, Burlingame, CA) and the biotinylated anti-mouse secondary antibody (1:250) provided by the manufacturer. 10T1/2 cells were cultured (6 × 105 cells/100 mm dish) with 0–5 ng/ml TGF-β1 for up to 3 days. Protein was isolated from cells as described previously (45Ruch R.J. Bonney W.J. Sigler K. Guan X. Matesic D. Schafer L.D. Dupont E. Trosko J.E.

Ten μg of protein were electrophoresed on 10% SDS-PAGE minigels (Bio-Rad) and then electrophoretically transferred to Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore). Membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk, 1% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline and then incubated 1–2 h with primary antibody (anti-SM-γ-actin, anti-SRF, and anti-HA, all at 1:1000 dilution). Antibody-antigen complexes were revealed using the ECL detection system (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). 10T1/2 cells were cultured (6 × 105 cells/100 mm dish) with 0–5 ng/ml TGF-β1 for up to 3 days. RNA was isolated from the cells using RNAzol B (Tel-Test, Friendswood, TX). Total RNA (10 μg per sample) was electrophorectically separated and transferred onto GeneScreen Plus nylon membrane (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). cDNA probes (murine SM-γ-actin, cytoplasmic γ-actin, and SRF) were labeled using Ready-To-Go DNA labeling beads (Pharmacia Biosciences, Inc.), purified by centrifugation through MicroSpin S-200 HR columns (Pharmacia Biosciences, Inc.), and hybridized at 1.5 × 106 cpm/ml. After washing, membranes were exposed to either X-Omat AR film (Eastman Kodak Co.) or a screen designed for imaging using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). The avian SM-γ-actin gene and ∼2.3 kb of DNA comprising the promoter have been previously cloned and sequenced (GenBankTM accession number AFO12348 (14Kovacs A.M. Zimmer W.E.

Mutagenesis of each of the six CArG/SRE motifs was accomplished by oligonucleotide mutagenesis using the ExsiteTM PCR mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), as described by the manufacturer. cDNA clones for mouse actin isoforms were obtained from Genome Systems (St. Louis, MO) and were enhanced sequence tag clones 1431913 (cytoplasmic γ-actin, GenBankTM accession number AA986689), 348425 (cytoplasmic β-actin, GenBankTM accession numberW35717), and 314246 (SM-γ-actin, GenBankTM accession number W09992). Isoform-specific probes were generated from these cDNAs by PCR using oligonucleotide primers that amplify the 3′-UTR segments of the mRNAs. Various chimeric SM-γ-actin-luciferase reporter gene constructs were transiently transfected into cultured 10T1/2 cells using LipofectAMINE reagent (Invitrogen), according to manufacturer's protocol. Cells were plated at 70,000 cells/well in 12-well dishes in DMEM, 2% CS, incubated overnight at 37 °C, then rinsed with DMEM and treated with 1 μg/well of DNA. After an overnight incubation, the cells were rinsed in phosphate-buffered saline and treated with DMEM, 2% CS ± 1 ng/ml TGF-β for 48 h. Positive (luciferase gene under the control of the SV40 promoter/enhancer) and negative (promoterless pGL-3 vector DNA) controls were included in each experiment. All promoter constructs were evaluated in a minimum of three separate experiments, three separate wells per experiments, and at least two separate plasmid preparations per construct. Promoter activity was evaluated by measurement of firefly luciferase activity according to manufacturer's protocol (Promega, Madison, WI), using a Turner model 20 luminometer. Each lysate was analyzed in triplicate and luciferase activity was normalized to protein content. Normalized luciferase activity in TGF-β-treated cells was compared with measured activity in cells in control conditions transfected with the same promoter-reporter DNA. The calculated values (mean ± S.D.) were plotted as fold increase in response to TGF-β treatment. Double-stranded oligonucleotides corresponding to the CArG/SRE2 motif (nucleotides −135 to −105 of the promoter) or the α-skeletal actin gene SRE (15Browning C.L. Culberson D.E. Aragon I.V.

Reaction mixtures were assembled in 50-μl volume containing 1 μg of poly(dI-dC) nonspecific competitor and 3 or 5 μg of nuclear lysate and preincubated of 10 min at room temperature. Appropriate labeled probe was then added and the mixture incubated for an additional 30 min. For control reactions, cold competitor probes were added at 50 times molar excess of labeled probe or an SRF-specific antibody added during the 10-min preincubation. Binding complexes were then resolved on 5% polyacrylamide gels, dried onto Whatman paper, and exposed to x-ray film (Kodak, Biomax BMR1). The nuclear lysates used in these assays were derived from TGF-β-treated, and nontreated, 10T1/2 cells and from SM tissue (avian gizzard) (15Browning C.L. Culberson D.E. Aragon I.V. Fillmore R.A. Croissant J.D. Schwartz R.J. Zimmer W.E. Dev. Biol. 1998; 194: 18-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). For quantitative assessment of binding complexes, the dried gels were exposed to PhosphorImager screens and analyzed using the Molecular Analysis Software package (Bio-Rad). In each experiment, binding activity observed in control cells was normalized to a value of 1.0 and directly compared with binding in lysates from the corresponding TGF-β treated cells. These values represent the mean ± S.D. 10T1/2 cells were transfected, via electroporation, with 5 μg of linearized HA-tagged expression plasmid containing no cDNA (vector control), 5 μg of linearized wild type (wt) SRF cDNA, or 5 μg of linearized SRF cDNA that contains a 3-bp substitution in the region known to mediate DNA binding, yielding a dominant negative SRF protein (dnSRF; described previously in Ref. 36Landerholm T.E. Dong X.-R., Lu, J. Belaguli N.S. Schwartz R.J. Majesky M.W. Development (Camb.). 1999; 126: 2053-2062Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All cells were cotransfected with a plasmid containing the neomycin resistance gene (pCI-neo; Promega) at 110 the concentration of experimental vector. Twelve stable transfectant clones were generated from each experimental group (vector, wtSRF, dnSRF) via selection in normal growth media containing 1000 μg/ml G418; thereafter, stable clones were maintained in 500 μg/ml G418. Total protein was isolated from each clone and screened via Western analyses to assess the expression of SRF protein and the HA tag. Two or three positive clones from each transfectant group were cultured in experimental media (2% CS, DMEM) in the presence or absence of 1 ng/ml TGF-β1 for 24 h; protein was isolated from each and analyzed for expression of SM-γ-actin. Multipotent 10T1/2 mesenchymal cells are induced toward a SM phenotype upon direct coculture with endothelial cells and in response to direct treatment with TGF-β (44Hirschi K.K. Rohovsky S.A. D'Amore P.A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 805-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (689) Google Scholar). This phenotypic transformation is characterized by up-regulation of SM-α-actin protein expression, induction of other SM-specific proteins including calponin, SM22α, and SM myosin heavy chain, and a dramatic shape change from flat and spread to elongated with pseudopodia (44Hirschi K.K. Rohovsky S.A. D'Amore P.A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 805-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (689) Google Scholar). Recent reports indicate that SM-γ-actin is coordinately regulated with calponin and SM22α in coronary artery SM progenitors (36Landerholm T.E. Dong X.-R., Lu, J. Belaguli N.S. Schwartz R.J. Majesky M.W. Development (Camb.). 1999; 126: 2053-2062Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, the expression of SM-γ-actin is induced in 10T1/2 cells that are cocultured with endothelial cells.2 Therefore, we aimed to determine whether TGF-β induces the expression of SM-γ-actin, a late marker of SM phenotype, in SM precursors and, if so, by what mechanism. To address this issue, multipotent 10T1/2 mesenchymal cells were incubated with 1 ng/ml TGF-β1 for 24 h and then assayed for SM-γ-actin expression. We found that although 10T1/2 mesenchymal cells did not express SM-γ-actin protein in control conditions (Fig.1 C), its expression and cytoskeletal localization was induced by TGF-β1 (Fig. 1 D) to a level similar to that of primary cultures of SM cells (Fig.1 B). As expected, endothelial cells did not express SM-γ-actin (Fig. 1 A). The time course of TGF-β induction of SM-γ-actin protein expression in 10T1/2 cells was examined by Western blot analyses. TGF-β induction of SM-γ-actin protein occurred after 12–24-h exposure to 1 ng/ml TGF-β1 (Fig.2 A); this effect was dose-dependent from 0.1 to 5 ng/ml TGF-β1 (not shown). SM-γ-actin protein was not detected in 10T1/2 cells in control conditions at any time point throughout the experimental period (Fig.2 A; representative time points shown).Figure 2Time course of TGF-β induction of SM -γ-actin protein and mRNA expression. A, 10T1/2 mesenchymal cells were incubated with or without 1 ng/ml TGF-β1 for 0, 4, 8, 12, 24, and 48 h, after which total protein lysates were isolated and subjected to Western blot analyses (10 μg of total protein/lane). SM-γ-actin protein (∼43 kDa) expression was induced after 12–24 h of TGF-β treatment compared with control (C) conditions.B, 10T1/2 mesenchymal cells were treated with 1 ng/ml TGF-β1 (as in A), after which total RNA was isolated and subjected to Northern blot analyses (5 μg of total RNA/lane). SM-γ-actin mRNA (∼1.5 kb) expression was induced after ∼8 h. Blots were re-hybridized with a specific probe to cytoplasmic γ-actin as a loading control. These data, taken together, suggest that SM-γ-actin gene expression is transcriptionally regulated in 10T1/2 cells by TGF-β.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To elucidate the mechanism by which TGF-β up-regulated SM-γ-actin production, we examined its effect on SM-γ-actin mRNA. We performed Northern blot analyses on total RNA isolated from 10T1/2 cells treated with or without 1 ng/ml TGF-β1 for up to 48 h. SM-γ-actin mRNA was up-regulated after ∼8 h exposure to TGF-β1 (Fig. 2 B), prior to induction of protein expression, suggesting that SM-γ-actin gene expression may be transcriptionally regulated by TGF-β in 10T1/2 mesenchymal cells.

Here recombinant pro-α1(V)2pro-α2(V) heterotrimers, representing what is by far the most prevalent in vivo form of type V procollagen, are successfully produced, and their processing, by cellular proteases in 293-EBNA cultures and by recombinant BMP-1 and furin in vitro, is characterized. In addition, biosynthetic processing of endogenous pro-α1(V) chains produced by fibroblasts derived from mouse embryos homozygous null for the genes encoding BMP-1, mTLD, and mTLL-1 is analyzed. Results support the conclusion that pro-α1(V) N-propeptides and pro-α2(V) C-propeptides are processed by BMP-1-like enzymes and pro-α1(V) C-propeptides are processed by furin-like enzymes, in vivo.

Cells were dilution-cloned in 96-well culture dishes (Costar), and media of 144 clones were analyzed for pro-α1(V) and pro-α2(V) chains by precipitating with trichloroacetic acid at 50 μm and visualization by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining. Chains were tested for triple helicity by bringing media to a final concentration of 0.5m acetic acid and incubating overnight with 100 μg/ml pepsin at 4 °C, followed by precipitation in 1.7 m NaCl, washing of the pellet with 70% ethanol, and analysis by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining. The clonal line producing highest levels of pepsin-resistant α1(V)2α2(V) heterotrimers was amplified for production of recombinant material used in this study. To obtain recombinant pro-α1(V)2pro-α2(V) heterotrimers, cell cultures were rinsed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and placed in serum-free DMEM with or without either 100 mml-arginine or varying concentrations of decanoyl-RVKR-chloromethyl ketone (Bachem), as indicated in the text. After 24 h, cells were switched to fresh serum-free DMEM containing 40 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor (Sigma) and either decanoyl-RVKR-chloromethyl ketone, 100 mml-arginine, or neither. Media were harvested 24 h later, and protease inhibitors were added to final concentrations of 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm N-ethylmaleimide, 1 mm p-aminobenzoic acid, and 10 mm EDTA. Samples were centrifuged to remove debris, and supernatants were dialyzed against 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.6, containing 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm N-ethylmaleimide, 1 mm p-aminobenzoic acid, and 5 mmEDTA at 4 °C to precipitate type V procollagen, as described (39Imamura Y.

Media were collected after 48 h, made 30% saturated with (NH4)2SO4, and nutated overnight at 4 °C. Samples were centrifuged for 15 min at 38,581 ×g and pellets were transferred to new tubes in −20 °C acetone. Pellets were washed 3 times in 12.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 75% ethanol at 4 °C, resuspended in 4× SDS-PAGE loading buffer, and boiled 5 min. Subsequent to SDS-PAGE, proteins were transferred to Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore) as described (44Lee S. Solow-Cordero D.E. Kessler E. Takahara K. Greenspan D.S. J. Biol.

Blots were blocked in phosphate-buffered saline, 0.05% Tween 20 (T-PBS) and incubated 15 h with primary antibody diluted 1:10,000 in T-PBS, 3% bovine serum albumin. After six 10-min washes with T-PBS, blots were blocked 1 h in T-PBS, 3% bovine serum albumin, and then incubated 30 min with peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG (Amersham Biosciences) diluted 1:5000 in T-PBS. Blots were washed six times, for 10 min each, with T-PBS, incubated 5 min with SuperSignal West Pico substrate (Pierce), and exposed to film. Apparent molecular weights of bands were estimated by comparison to electrophoretic mobilities of prestained standards (Bio-Rad). Polyclonal antibodies to the pro-α1(V) variable subdomain were raised in rabbits against the peptide CADDLEGEFTEETIRNLD, corresponding to residues 397–413 of the published human pro-α1(V) sequence (45Greenspan D.S.

Antibodies were affinity-purified on columns of the same peptide coupled to TC gel (BIOSOURCE) via the cysteine thiol (44Lee S. Solow-Cordero D.E. Kessler E. Takahara K. Greenspan D.S. J. Biol.

Bands were excised, and NH2-terminal sequencing was performed by automated Edman degradation at the Harvard Microchemistry Facility. Purified recombinant BMP-1, produced by a clonal line of transfected 293 cells, was kindly provided by FibroGen. Substrate (1–2 μg) was incubated 17 h with or without BMP-1 (60 ng) at 37 °C in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2. For furin digests, 1–2 μg of pro-α1(V)2pro-α2(V) heterotrimers or type I procollagen were incubated 5 h at 30 °C in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride, 0.1 mg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin, with or without 1 unit recombinant furin (Affinity Bioreagents). To enable characterization of proteolytic processing of the pro-α chains of pro-α1(V)2pro-α2(V) heterotrimers, the predominantin vivo form of type V procollagen, previously derived 293-EBNA cells expressing recombinant human pro-α1(V)3homotrimers (39Imamura Y. Steiglitz B.M. Greenspan D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27511-27517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), were re-transfected with a human pro-α2(V) expression vector. Subsequently, a clonal line secreting ∼0.8 μg/ml pro-α1(V)2pro-α2(V) heterotrimers into media was isolated. As described previously (39Imamura Y. Steiglitz B.M. Greenspan D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27511-27517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) for pro-α1(V)3homotrimers, full-length pro-α1(V) chains were not recovered in media of 293-EBNA cells secreting pro-α1(V)2pro-α2(V) heterotrimers. Rather, a 230-kDa band consistent in size with pNα1(V) chains was observed (Fig. 1 A,lane 1), along with a 40-kDa cleavage product (not shown) demonstrated by NH2-terminal amino acid sequencing to be free pro-α1(V) C-propeptides, cleaved at a previously described (39Imamura Y. Steiglitz B.M. Greenspan D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27511-27517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) consensus sequence for furin-like proprotein convertases. Because arginine has been found previously to inhibit proteolytic processing of the C-propeptides of procollagens I–III and V (24Kumamoto C.A. Fessler J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 7053-7058Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), 100 mmarginine was added to transfected 293-EBNA cultures, resulting in partial inhibition in cleavage of the C-propeptides of pro-α1(V) chains within pro-α1(V)2pro-α2(V) heterotrimers. This inhibition was evident in the appearance of 260-kDa full-length pro-α1(V) chains and concomitant reduction in the amount of 230-kDa pNα1(V) chains (Fig. 1 A, lane 2) and 40-kDa C-propeptides (not shown) in media of arginine-treated cultures. Addition of the highly specific and potent furin inhibitor decanoyl-RVKR-chloromethyl ketone to cultures completely inhibited cleavage of pro-α1(V) C-propeptides, resulting in detection of only full-length pro-α1(V) chains in media (Fig. 1 A, lane 3), thus demonstrating cleavage of pro-α1(V) C-propeptides to be due solely to a furin-like activity of 293-EBNA cells. Pepsin digestion of recombinant material from media yielded resistant bands equal in size to the α1(V) and α2(V) chains of pepsinized type V collagen from human placenta (Fig. 1 B), thus demonstrating the recombinant type V procollagen to have a native triple helical configuration. Moreover, because pro-α2(V) chains are pepsin-sensitive unless in heterotrimers together with pro-α1(V) chains (41Greenspan D.S. Hoffman G.G. Lee B.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 20683-20687Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the pepsin-resistant nature of the material in Fig.1 B demonstrates all recombinant pro-α2(V) chains to be contained in heterotrimers also containing pro-α1(V) chains. The roughly 2:1 ratio of pro-α1(V) to pro-α2(V) chains in material either treated or untreated with pepsin (e.g. Fig.1 B, lanes 1 and 2) indicates the majority of recombinant type V procollagen produced in the current study to be in the form of pro-α1(V)2pro-α2(V) heterotrimers. In contrast, to the observed processing of pro-α1(V) chains by 293-EBNA cells, pro-α2(V) chains within the same pro-α1(V)2pro-α2(V) heterotrimers remain intact, with only full-length pro-α2(V) chains detected in media of 293-EBNA cultures untreated with arginine or decanoyl-RVKR-chloromethyl ketone (Fig. 1 A, lane 1). Thus, pro-α2(V) chains are not processed by the furin-like activity in 293-EBNA cells that cleaves pro-α1(V) C-propeptides. Similarly, in vitro treatment of pro-α1(V)2pro-α2(V) heterotrimers with recombinant furin results in efficient cleavage of pro-α1(V) C-propeptides but no detectable processing of pro-α2(V) chains (Fig.2, lanes 1–3). As demonstrated in Fig. 2 (lanes 4–6), furin also does not process either the pro-α1(I) or pro-α2(I) chains of type I procollagen (Fig. 2, lanes 4–6). Thus, cleavage by furinin vitro and by a furin-like activity in cultures of transfected cells is highly specific to pro-α1(V) C-propeptides, and even pro-α2(V) chains in the same pro-α1(V)2pro-α2(V) heterotrimers are impervious to this activity. Previously, we observed in vitro cleavage by BMP-1 of the N- but not C-propeptides of recombinant pro-α1(V)3 homotrimers (39Imamura Y. Steiglitz B.M. Greenspan D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27511-27517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). More recently, however, Kessler et al. (40Kessler E. Fichard A. Chanut-Delalande H. Brusel M. Ruggiero F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27051-27057Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), although confirming our observation of the specific cleavage by BMP-1 of pro-α1(V)3 N-propeptides, observed that BMP-1 is capable of processing the C-propeptides of these molecules as well. An obvious difference between the two previous studies was the higher specific activity of BMP-1 preparations used by Kessler et al. (40Kessler E. Fichard A. Chanut-Delalande H. Brusel M. Ruggiero F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27051-27057Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), which completely processed pro-α1(V)3 N-propeptides after a 2-h incubation, compared with those used by Imamura et al.(39Imamura Y. Steiglitz B.M. Greenspan D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27511-27517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), which processed only ∼50% of pro-α1(V)3N-propeptides after a 17-h incubation, under similar reaction conditions. Another difference between the two studies is that, prior to incubation with BMP-1, pro-α1(V)3 homotrimers used as substrate by Kessler et al. (40Kessler E. Fichard A. Chanut-Delalande H. Brusel M. Ruggiero F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27051-27057Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) had been protected with decanoyl-RVKR-chloromethyl ketone from cleavage by the furin-like activity of 293-EBNA cultures, whereas pro-α1(V)3homotrimers used as substrate by Imamura et al. (39Imamura Y. Steiglitz B.M. Greenspan D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27511-27517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) had been protected from C-propeptide cleavage by use of arginine. Thus, in the current study we utilized relatively high specific activity recombinant BMP-1, recently prepared in 293 cells (7Scott I.C. Blitz I.L. Pappano W.N. Imamura Y. Clark T.G. Steiglitz B.M. Thomas C.L. Maas S.A. Takahara K. Cho K.W.Y. Greenspan D.S. Dev. Biol. 1999; 213: 283-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar), so that processing of pro-α1(V) C-propeptides in pro-α1(V)2pro-α2(V) heterotrimers might be detected if BMP-1 is indeed capable of such cleavage. In addition, two different batches of pro-α1(V)2pro-α2(V) heterotrimeric substrate were prepared in which cleavage by furin-like activities in 293-EBNA cells was inhibited either by arginine or by decanoyl-RVKR-chloromethyl ketone. As can be seen (Fig.3 A), BMP-1 processing of pro-α1(V)2pro-α2(V) heterotrimers, produced in the presence of either arginine or decanoyl-RVKR-chloromethyl ketone, yields three bands. The largest (Fig. 3 A, lanes 2and 3) corresponds to pC-α1(V), in which only the PARP subdomain of the N-propeptide has been removed, and which consistently migrates on SDS-PAGE gels with a mobility faster than that of pN-α1(V) (Fig. 3 A, lanes 1 and 3, also see Fig. 5). The other 2 bands are mature α1(V) and pN-α2(V) chains (Fig. 3 A, lanes 2 and 3). The former of these lacks the N-propeptide PARP subdomain and the C-propeptide. Thus, as observed by Kessler et al. (40Kessler E. Fichard A. Chanut-Delalande H. Brusel M. Ruggiero F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27051-27057Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) for pro-α1(V)3 homotrimers, BMP-1 is capable of processing both the N- and C-propeptides of pro-α1(V) chains in pro-α1(V)2pro-α2(V) heterotrimers. However, a consistent finding over the course of a number of experiments was the presence of residual pC-, but not pN-α1(V) forms upon cleavage of pro-α1(V)2pro-α2(V) heterotrimers with BMP-1 (e.g. Fig. 3 A, lane 3). Therefore,in vitro BMP-1 processing of pro-α1(V) N-propeptides is more efficient than processing of pro-α1(V) C-propeptides, consistent with the observation of Kessler et al. ("

Moreover, it has been well established that the deliberate circularization of normally linear proteins by a covalent peptide link between the NH2- and COOH-terminal ends provides a route for stabilization of the native structure (4Iwai H. Plückthun A. FEBS Lett. 1999; 459: 166-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 5Iwai H. Lingel A. Plückthun A. J. Biol.

Thermal stability is an important feature, for example, for use of enzymes as catalysts in industrial applications, and also during long NMR recording times at elevated temperatures. Compared with the engineering of a disulfide bridge between the termini, a peptide link protects against digestion by exo-proteases and is inert in reducing environments, which has implications for therapeutic use of proteins and peptides. The engineering of circular polypeptides is straightforward by the use of inteins. Inteins are protein domains that perform a cis-splicing reaction to excise themselves post-translationally from nascent polypeptide chains (7Paulus H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 447-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar), forming a new peptide bond between the two remaining parts (the exteins; Fig.1 A). Inteins can be split and expressed as two inactive halves (N-intein, IntN1 and C-intein, IntC) that regain activity when brought together (8Mills K.V. Lew B.M. Jiang S. Paulus H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3543-3548Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 9Shingledecker K. Jiang S.Q. Paulus H.

This allows production of a protein from two segments that are subsequently ligated together in vitro by the intein in atrans-splicing process (11Yamazaki T. Otomo T. Oda N. Kyogoku Y. Uegaki K. Ito N. Ishino Y. Nakamura H. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; 120: 5591-5592Crossref Scopus (191) Google Scholar). The expression of a synthetic fusion gene that encodes a protein with the structure IntC-extein-IntN (i.e.containing a circularly permuted split intein; Fig. 1 B) can lead to production of a cyclized (cz-) protein, with its NH2 and COOH termini linked by a normal peptide bond. This approach has recently been demonstrated to cyclize proteins and peptides in vivo in Escherichia coli (5Iwai H. Lingel A. Plückthun A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16548-16554Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 6Scott C.P. Abel-Santos E. Wall M. Wahnon D.C. Benkovic S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

While use of circularly permuted inteins to effect protein cyclization has been achieved, more work is required to establish which of the many inteins available is appropriate to use in a particular experiment to produce high levels of cyclized target proteins without the accumulation of linear forms or splicing intermediates. Two of the three reports to date used the naturally split Synechocystissp. PCC6803 (Ssp) DnaE intein to effect protein (6Scott C.P. Abel-Santos E. Wall M. Wahnon D.C. Benkovic S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Chem. 2001; 276: 16548-16554Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) made use of an artificially split PI-PfuI intein from Pyrococcus furiosus. In all three cases, the yield of cyclized product was affected by the accumulation of other products of incomplete splicing. We chose to work with a split Ssp DnaB mini-intein that had been shown to be effective in trans-splicing reactions (13Wu H. Xu M. Liu X. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1387: 422-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). To ensure good expression in E. coli, the intein gene was constructed de novo from overlapping oligonucleotides, with optimized codon usage. When split and rearranged in the appropriate way, the intein was shown to be active in promoting the cyclization of a target protein in vivo, in a reaction that occurs rapidly without significant accumulation of the IntC-extein-IntN precursor or splicing intermediates. DnaB-(24–136), the NH2-terminal domain of theE. coli replicative helicase DnaB, was chosen as the target protein for cyclization, in part because it was known from NMR structural studies (14Weigelt J. Brown S.E. Miles C.S. Dixon N.E. Otting G. Structure. 1999; 7: 681-690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) to fold reversibly with its termini close together (Fig. 2). So as not to compromise flexibility at the ends of the DnaB portion of the circular protein, a 9-residue linker peptide was inserted between them. NMR spectroscopy was used to examine aspects of the structure of the product cz-DnaB-N, and its thermostability was measured by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). Statistics for spatial separation of termini in proteins have been compiled (15Christopher J.A. Baldwin T.O. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 257: 175-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) and indicate that cyclization through short (adjustable) linkers ought to be feasible for many single-domain proteins of unknown structure. It could therefore be worthwhile to attempt cyclization as part of a sample optimization procedure prior to protein structure determination by NMR spectroscopy. It is also shown how simple polymer theory can be used to predict the extent of thermodynamic stabilization achievable by protein circularization.

BL21(DE3)recA was constructed by P1 transduction with AN1459 as donor and BL21(DE3) (20Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (5981) Google Scholar) as recipient, with selection for tetracycline resistance and screening for UV sensitivity. The protein lin-DnaB-N, comprised of a methionine residue followed by residues 24–136 of E. coli DnaB, was expressed and purified as described (14Weigelt J. Brown S.E. Miles C.S. Dixon N.E. Otting G. Structure. 1999; 7: 681-690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Four pairs of oligonucleotides overlapping at their 3′ ends (I-5′ and I-3′ through IV-5′ and IV-3′; Fig. 3) were purchased from Interactiva (Germany). Each primer in annealed pairs was extended by a PCR reaction, giving double-stranded linear DNA fragments I-IV. Fragments I and II were mixed and PCR amplified by primers I-5′ and II-3′, resulting in the 215-bp product I-II. Similarly, the fragments III and IV, mixed with primers III-5′ and IV-3′, gave the 323-bp fragment III-IV. Finally, a mixture of products I-II and III-IV was PCR amplified with the primers I-5′ and IV-3′ to give the complete artificial 523-bp intein gene flanked by BamHI andHindIII sites (Fig. 3). PCR cycle conditions were: 20 s denaturation at 95 °C, 30 s annealing at 58 °C, and 2 min polymerization at 68 °C. The first extension steps used 2-min predenaturation at 95 °C followed by 5 PCR cycles. Reamplification of mixed products was carried out with the same predenaturation step, 30 PCR cycles, and a final 5-min extension step at 68 °C. The reaction mixture contained 10 pmol of each primer, 100 pg of each mixed template, 0.25 mm of each dNTP, and 2.5 units ofPfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene) in 100 μl of 100 mm KCl, 100 mm(NH4)2SO4, 200 mmTris·HCl (pH 8.75), 20 mm MgSO4, 1% Triton X-100, and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. The 514-bp BamHI-HindIII fragment bearing the synthetic mini-intein gene was inserted between the same two sites of pQE30 and plasmids from transformants were used for DNA sequence determination. One that contained no mutations was retained as pQE30-Int. Conditions for PCR, using Vent DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs) were essentially as described (14Weigelt J. Brown S.E. Miles C.S. Dixon N.E. Otting G. Structure. 1999; 7: 681-690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 21Miles C.S. Weigelt J. Stamford N.P.J. Dammerova N. Otting G. Dixon N.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 231: 126-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Fragments were digested with restriction endonucleases at sites introduced within oligonucleotide primers (supplied by GeneWorks, Australia), isolated after separation by agarose gel electrophoresis, and inserted into plasmids as described below. Nucleotide sequences of inserted fragments were confirmed using appropriate vector-specific primers (16Neylon C. Brown S.E. Kralicek A.V. Miles C.S. Love C.A. Dixon N.E. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 11989-11999Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 17Love C.A. Lilley P.E. Dixon N.E.

Gene (Amst.). 1990; 87: 123-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). A DNA fragment encoding IntC was amplified using pQE30-Int as template, with primers 508 (5′-CCATCACCATATGTCTCCGGAAATCG;NdeI) and 510 (5′-TAGAATTCGATAGAGTTGTGAACGATGATGTCGTTGGCC;EcoRI). The EcoRI site in primer 510 replaced the 5′-GAGTAA sequence at the 3′ end of the mini-intein gene in pQE30-Int, removing the stop codon. The 156-bp fragment was inserted between theNdeI and EcoRI sites of vector pETMCSI to give pNW1117 (4799 bp). An IntN-encoding fragment was similarly amplified using primers 507 (5′-GTCGACGCGTGAGTCTGGCTGCATCTCTGGTGATTCTC;MluI) and 509 (5′-CATGGTACCTTACAGCTGCAGAGAGGAGCTCTCCAGTTTACG; KpnI). TheKpnI site in primer 509 immediately followed a new TAA stop codon. The MluI-KpnI treated fragment (336 bp) was ligated with the 4784-bp EcoRI-KpnI fragment of pNW1117 in the presence of an excess of an equimolar mixture of 5′-unphosphorylated oligonucleotides 511 (5′-AATTCTAAAAGCTTTAAGAAGGAGATATACATATGACGTCGA) and 512 (5′-CGCGTCGACGTCATATGTATATCTCCTTCTTAAAGCTTTTAG), to give plasmid pNW1118 (Fig. 4 A). The 511/512 oligonucleotide adaptor provides a stop codon at the end of the C-intein gene (intC ), followed by a strong ribosome-binding site and ATG initiation codon as part of anNdeI site at the 5′ end of int N. Plasmid pNW1118 was designed to direct expression of the two fragments of the split mini-intein under control of the phage T7 φ10 promoter. Next, a DNA fragment encoding residues 24–136 of E. coli DnaB was amplified using pSB958 as template, with primers 524 (5′-TCGAATTCAAAGTGCCTCCGCACTCGA TCGAAGC; EcoRI) and 525 (5′-ACTCACGCGTCGAGATCATCTCACGGACAACGG CAC; MluI). After restriction endonuclease digestion, the 345-bp fragment was inserted between the EcoRI and MluI sites of pNW1118 to give pNW1119 (5465 bp). Although designed to direct expression of an IntC-DnaB-(24–136)-IntNfusion protein, and then cz-DnaB-N, under control of the T7 promoter, this plasmid performed poorly, so the whole fusion gene was transferred as an 841-bp NdeI-NcoI fragment to the bacteriophage λ-promoter vector pCL476, to give pNW1120 (Fig.4 B). This also endowed the precursor protein with an NH2-terminal Met-His6 tag at the beginning of the IntC portion. E. coli strain AN1459/pNW1120, used for production of the cz-DnaB-N and the split Ssp DnaB mini-intein, was grown in four 1-liter cultures of LB medium supplemented with thymine (25 mg/liter) and ampicillin (50 mg/liter). For 15N labeling experiments, strain BL21(DE3)recA/pNW1120 was grown in 1 liter of minimal medium, consisting of 100 mm Na/potassium phosphate buffer, trace salts, thiamine (1 mg/liter), 1 mm MgSO4, 40 mm glucose, 15NH4Cl (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, 1 g/liter), and ampicillin (50 mg/liter). The strains were grown at 30 °C until A 595 = 0.5, then heated rapidly and incubated at 42 °C for 3–4 h. Cultures were cooled in ice, and cells (3.6–4.0 g/liter of culture) were harvested by centrifugation and stored at −70 °C. The cz-DnaB-N domain was purified by chromatography through columns of DEAE-Fractogel (Merck) and Sephadex G-50 (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) essentially as described for linear DnaB NH2-terminal domains (14Weigelt J. Brown S.E. Miles C.S. Dixon N.E. Otting G. Structure. 1999; 7: 681-690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 21Miles C.S. Weigelt J. Stamford N.P.J. Dammerova N. Otting G. Dixon N.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 231: 126-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The yield in several preparations was ∼10 mg/liter of culture. Among proteins that did not bind to the anion-exchange column was the split mini-intein product of the excision reaction. This fraction was dialyzedversus 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.9), 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol (Buffer D) and loaded at a flow rate of 1 ml/min onto a column (2.5 × 16 cm) of CM-Fractogel (Merck) equilibrated with the same buffer. After washing with 120 ml of the buffer, the intein was eluted in a linear gradient (300 ml) of NaCl (0–0.25 m) in Buffer D. Fractions that contained the split intein, eluted at ∼0.1m NaCl, were pooled. The purified yield was typically 3 mg/liter of culture. Concentrations of proteins were determined spectrophotometrically at 280 nm, using values of ε280 calculated from their amino acid compositions (22Gill S.C. von Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5010) Google Scholar): 9,530 m−1 cm−1 for lin- and cz-DnaB-N; 19,630 m−1 cm−1 for the Ssp DnaB mini-intein. SDS-polyacrylamide gels were usually stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. Proteins containing the small IntC subunit, which has an NH2-terminal Met-His6-tag, were visualized in 18% SDS-polyacrylamide gels with a short wavelength UV source following staining with the GelCodeTM His6 tag Staining Kit (Pierce), as recommended. The extent of isotopic labeling and the molecular weights of the cz-DnaB-N and the split intein subunits were determined by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry. Samples of proteins at 0.5–0.7 mg/ml were extensively dialyzed in 0.1% formic acid in water and analyzed on a VG Quattro II mass spectrometer (VG Biotech Ltd.) equipped with an electrospray ionization source and a quadrupole-hexapole-quadrupole mass analyzer. Spectra were processed using software supplied by the manufacturer. Purified cz-DnaB-N (1.4 mg/ml) in 50 mm Tris·HCl (pH 7.6), 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 15% (w/v) glycerol, was treated with trypsin (80 μg/ml; Roche Molecular Biochemicals, AR grade) at 0 °C. Samples (50 μl) were withdrawn at various times and frozen in liquid N2. Following addition of 50 μl of a gel-loading buffer containing 2% (w/v) SDS, they were thawed and 50-μl samples were subjected to 18% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The gel was stained with Coomassie Blue and photographed, then washed three times in 10% methanol. Selected bands were excised, and subjected to 10 cycles of Edman degradation using an Applied Biosystems Procise Sequencer. Recoveries of amino acids in successive cycles were 25–50 pmol. Samples of lin- (60.0 μm) and cz-DnaB-N (62.9 μm) were dialyzed extensively against 10 mm Na·HEPES (pH 7.5), 0.5 mm EDTA, degassed, and used for differential scanning calorimetry in a VP-DSC microcalorimeter (MicroCal) with a cell capacity of 0.51 ml. A 1.5-bar pressure was applied to the cell during measurement. Following equilibration for 15 min at the starting temperature, the temperature range +5 to +80 °C was scanned, increased (for unfolding) or decreased (for refolding) at a rate of 1 °C/min. Profiles were recorded for 3 or 4 heating/cooling cycles to ensure consistent results, corrected with data measured under identical conditions with the final dialysis buffer, and analyzed using the MicroCal calorimetry analysis package version 5.0 (MicroCal Origin). U-15N-Labeled cz-DnaB-N was dialyzed extensively versus 20 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.5) containing 1 mm EDTA and 0.02% NaN3, then concentrated using an Ultrafree-4 centrifugal filter unit equipped with a Biomax-5K membrane (Millipore). Pefabloc (Roche Molecular Biochemicals; ∼1 mm) was added as a protease inhibitor and the pH was adjusted to 7.0. Samples of unlabeled lin- and cz-DnaB-N were prepared in the same way. Final sample concentrations were about 0.8 mm, except that the sample of unlabeled cz-DnaB-N was 16% more concentrated than that of unlabeled lin-DnaB-N. All NMR experiments were conducted in 90% H2O, 10% D2O at 31 °C using Bruker DMX-600, DRX-500, or Varian Unity INOVA-800 NMR spectrometers. Two-dimensional NOESY (60 ms mixing time) and TOCSY spectra (70 ms mixing time) were recorded of the unlabeled samples at 800 MHz1H NMR frequency. In addition, the 15N-labeled cz-DnaB-N sample was used to record a three-dimensional TOCSY-15N-HSQC spectrum (60 ms mixing time) at 500 MHz, and {1H}-15N steady-state NOEs (4 s1H saturation, 500 MHz 1H frequency, 4 days total recording time). The resonances of cz-DnaB-N were assigned using XEASY (23Bartels C. Xia T. Güntert P. Billeter M. Wüthrich K. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (1585) Google Scholar). The resonance assignments of lin-DnaB-N and cz-DnaB-N were deposited at the BioMagResBank (accession codes 5121 and 5122, respectively). The nucleotide sequence of the artificial Ssp dnaB mini-intein was generated using the original protein sequence (SWISSPROT Q55418), starting with amino acids 378–486, followed by a His6-Met segment, and finished by residues 762–812 of the same sequence (Fig. 3). The codon usage was optimized for E. coli, and restriction endonuclease sites were incorporated. The gene was synthesized in vitro using a recursive PCR amplification technique based on the filling in of the 3′ ends of overlapping primers, and mixing of the resulting overlapping fragments (24Casimiro D.R. Wright P.E. Dyson H.J. Structure. 1997; 5: 1407-1412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The synthetic gene was inserted into vector pQE30 to generate a plasmid (pQE30-Int) that directed expression of the mini-intein inE. coli (not shown). A series of PCR amplifications with pQE30-Int as template was used to split the synthetic gene to produce a phage T7-promoter plasmid pNW1118 (Fig. 4 A) that directed simultaneous expression of the mini-intein C- and N-terminal fragments (IntC and IntN, respectively) from a bicistronic mRNA. Downstream of the promoter in pNW1118 are a strong E. coliribosome-binding site and ATG start codon at the beginning of the IntC-encoding sequence (intC gene), which is terminated by a TAA stop codon. This is followed by a further ribosome-binding site and start codon preceding theint N gene, which is also terminated with a stop codon. Plasmid pNW1118 (Fig. 4 A) was designed such that the int C stop codon and int Ntranslation initiation region could be removed as anEcoRI-MluI fragment and replaced with a segment of DNA encoding a protein or peptide destined for intein-mediated cyclization. In the present work, a modified gene encoding the NH2-terminal domain of the E. coli replicative helicase, DnaB-(24–136), was inserted between these sites to give plasmid pNW1119. It was expected that pNW1119 would direct expression of an IntC-DnaB-(24–136)-IntN fusion protein (containing a circularly permuted intein), leading to excision of DnaB-(24–136) with its NH2 and COOH termini fused via a 9-amino acid linker with sequence TRESGSIEF, i.e. the cyclized protein we call cz-DnaB-N (Fig. 2). The fusion junction is predicted to be between Gly5 and Ser6 of this sequence. However, expression in this T7 system was poor, so the whole gene cassette was transferred into the phage λ-promoter vector pCL476 (17Love C.A. Lilley P.E. Dixon N.E. Gene (Amst.). 1996; 176: 49-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), which also resulted in addition of an NH2-terminal Met-His6 tag to the NH2 terminus of the IntC portion of the fusion protein. The new plasmid, pNW1120 (Fig. 4 B), directed heat-induced expression of several new protein species that could be resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Fig.5), including those that were later identified as being cz-DnaB-N and IntN (see below). The 6.4-kDa IntC subunit could not be detected on gels by staining with Coomassie Blue, but could be identified by use of a fluorescent staining procedure for detection of His6-tagged proteins (not shown). In addition to these products that were securely identified following their purification, a small amount of an approximately 30-kDa protein accumulated with time in cultures at 42 °C (Fig. 5). This is assumed to be the IntC–DnaB-(24–136)-IntN precursor to intein excision. Another species that migrated at a position expected of a 16–18-kDa protein (Fig. 5) has not been identified. It also stained with the His6-detection system, and was also present consistently (at about 10% of total protein) in otherwise highly purified samples of the split intein. Prolonged treatment in buffer at 37 °C and variation of the concentration of SDS and heating during denaturation of the isolated intein samples had no effect on the proportion of this impurity. Attempts to separate it from the split intein by chromatography on a column of Mono-S (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) at pH 6.0 or 6.8, with elution in a gradient of NaCl, or in a pH gradient, were unsuccessful. It is clearly a basic protein with an isolelectric point close to that of the split intein, so cannot be the more acidic 20-kDa IntC-cz-DnaB-N branched ester (lariat) intermediate expected to be formed during the intein-mediated excision reaction (6Scott C.P.

Biochem. 2000; 69: 447-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). It appears therefore to be a covalently linked IntC-IntN product. How such a species might be generated requires further investigation. Other groups that have used related strategies to circularize proteinsin vivo have also observed overexpressed proteins that include the fusion protein precursor and some others that are assumed to be by-products of the excision reaction (5Iwai H. Lingel A. Plückthun A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16548-16554Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 6Scott C.P. Abel-Santos E. Wall M. Wahnon D.C. Benkovic S.J. Proc.

Chem. 2000; 275: 9091-9094Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). By comparison, the amounts of these products accumulating in the present system are rather small. To show that the protein thus far believed to be the circularized cz-DnaB-N is in fact DnaB-(24–136) with its NH2 and COOH termini covalently linked via a 9-residue linker containing normal peptide bonds, the protein was isolated in pure form (Fig. 5) from temperature-induced cultures ofE. coli AN1459/pNW1120. Although it was predicted to be eight residues longer (876 Da higher in mass) than the 12.7-kDa lin-DnaB-N (which has an additional NH2-terminal methionine), its electrophoretic mobility was nearly identical (Fig.6). Increased electrophoretic mobility of circularized proteins, presumably due to them having more compact structures in the denatured state, has been reported previously (5Iwai H. Lingel A. Plückthun A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16548-16554Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar,6Scott C.P. Abel-Santos E. Wall M. Wahnon D.C. Benkovic S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13638-13643Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). Treatment of the purified protein with trypsin resulted in most of it converting rapidly (t 12 ∼30 s at 0 °C) to a species of reduced mobility (Fig. 6, fragment I). This was followed by slower (t 12 ∼10 min) conversion of this fragment to another very close in size to lin-DnaB-N (fragment II), and to more extensive degradation via several smaller intermediates (fragments III). The sites of trypsin cleavage were identified by NH2-terminal sequence determination using samples extracted from the gel, as indicated in Fig. 6. Fragment I had the sequence ESGSIEFKVP, so the most sensitiv"

Biopsies from patients with KSHV-related diseases such as Kaposi's sarcoma, multicentric Castleman's disease, and primary effusion lymphoma show demethylation of the ORF50 promoter, whereas samples from a latently infected KSHV carrier show a methylated ORF50 promoter. These data suggest that the expression of ORF50 is very important for the development of KSHV-associated diseases. ORF50 binds to the cellular proteins CBP and histone deacetylase, and these binding events activate and repress ORF50-activated viral transcription, respectively (10Gwack Y. Byun H. Hwang S. Lim C.

By sequestering CBP and thus preventing its interaction with the tumor suppressor p53, ORF50 represses the transcriptional activation function of p53 and p53-induced apoptosis (11Gwack Y. Hwang S. Byun H. Lim C. Kim J.W. Choi E.J. Choe J. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 6245-6248Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). STATs are a family of latent cytoplasmic proteins that are activated by various cytokines and growth factors (12Schindler C. Darnell J.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 621-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (1642) Google Scholar, 13Chatterjee-Kishore M. van den Akker F. Stark G.R.

STATs have an amino-terminal protein/protein interaction domain, a DNA interaction domain, an SH2 domain, and a single tyrosine phosphorylation site. Phosphorylation of this tyrosine residue stabilizes the association of two STAT monomers through the interaction between the phosphotyrosine and SH2 domain (12Schindler C. Darnell J.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 621-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (1642) Google Scholar, 13Chatterjee-Kishore M. van den Akker F. Stark G.R.

These activated STAT dimers translocate into the nucleus, where they bind to their cognate DNA response elements. In addition to their normal roles in cell signaling, a relationship between the activation of STATs and oncogenesis has been shown (15Bowman T. Garcia R. Turkson J. Jove R. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2474-2488Crossref PubMed Scopus (1581) Google Scholar,16Bromberg J. Darnell J.E. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2468-2473Crossref PubMed Scopus (1041) Google Scholar). A number of oncoproteins can activate specific STATs, and the activated STAT protein participates in oncogenesis by stimulating cell proliferation and preventing apoptosis. Several tumor viruses are known to be associated with STAT activation. STAT3 and STAT5 are constitutively activated in human T cell lymphotrophic virus I-transformed T cells (17Migone T.S. Lin J.X. Cereseto A. Mulloy J.C. O'Shea J.J. Franchini G. Leonard W.J. Science. 1995; 269: 79-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). The herpesvirus saimiri tyrosine kinase-interacting protein Tip-484 also activates STAT3 through up-regulation of p56lck, a non-receptor tyrosine kinase (18Lund T.C. Garcia R. Medveczky M.M. Jove R. Medveczky P.G. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 6677-6682Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Constitutively activated STATs are also found in lymphoid and myeloid leukemia cells and in EBV-related lymphoma cell lines (19Weber-Nordt R.M. Egen C. Wehinger J. Ludwig W. Gouilleux-Gruart V. Mertelsmann R. Finke J. Blood. 1996; 88: 809-816Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Chen H. Lee J.M. Zong Y. Borowitz M., Ng, M.H. Ambinder R.F. Hayward S.D. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 2929-2937Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Taken together, these observations indicate that certain viruses modify STAT activity (particularly STAT3) to increase the persistence, replication, or oncogenic potential of the viruses. In this report, we show that KSHV ORF50 activates STAT3-mediated transcription without mediating tyrosine phosphorylation. The expression plasmid that contains FLAG-tagged STAT3 and the reporter plasmid p3XLy6e-luc were kind gifts from Dr. James E. Darnell. The vector pBabe-v-Src and reporter plasmids ptk-luc and pSIE-luc were gifts from Dr. Richard Jove. ORF50 and the ORF50 deletion mutants were subcloned into pcDNA3 (EcoRI andXhoI sites) (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) using PCR. Green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion vectors were constructed using pEGFP-C1 (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA). The ORF50 and STAT3 fragments were introduced into pGEX4T-1 (Amersham Biosciences, Inc., Uppsala, Sweden), and the glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins were expressed and purified according to the manufacturer's instructions. Transfection assays were performed in 293T cells using the calcium phosphate method. Transfection assays in NIH3T3 cells were performed using LipofectAMINE Plus reagent (Invitrogen). In all assays, the luciferase activity derived from the reporter plasmids was determined after normalizing to the β-galactosidase activity from a cotransfected pRSV-βgal control plasmid. All experiments were performed in triplicate. Equivalent expression of each plasmid was verified by Western blot assays (data not shown). 293T cells were transfected with 1 μg of reporter plasmid, either 20 ng (in 293T cells) or 1 μg (in NIH3T3 cells) of pRSV-βgal control plasmid, and the amounts of the expression plasmids indicated in the figure legends. The total amount of each expression vector was kept constant by adding empty pCMV expression plasmid. BJAB cells were transfected by electroporation as described previously (8Lukac D.M. Kirshner J.R. Ganem D. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 9348-9361Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). ORF50, STAT3, and their deletion mutants were in vitro transcribed and translated using a T7-coupled transcription/translation system (Promega Corp., Madison, WI). The labeled proteins were incubated with 1 μg of a GST fusion protein in binding buffer (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 100 mm NaCl, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40 supplemented with protease inhibitors). Glutathione beads were then added, and the reaction mixture was incubated at 4 °C overnight. The beads were washed four times with binding buffer; SDS-PAGE sample buffer was added; and the proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and visualized by autoradiography or phosphorimaging (BAS-1500, Fuji Film Co., Tokyo, Japan). 293T cells were transfected with 7 μg of each expression plasmid using the calcium phosphate method. The cells were harvested 48 h after transfection and lysed in the binding buffer (containing 1% Triton X-100) used in the GST pull-down assays. The cell lysates were rotated in the buffer for 1 h at 4 °C before the cell debris was removed by centrifugation. The appropriate lysates were immunoprecipitated with the addition of antibody to GFP, hemagglutinin (HA), or FLAG (Sigma) and protein G resin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). The beads were washed four times, and the proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, and visualized with ECL reagent (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. GFP/ORF50 (1 μg) and expression vectors containing FLAG-tagged STAT3 were transfected into 293T cells (1 μg). Cells were fixed and immunostained 48 h after transfection. FLAG-tagged STAT3 was detected using a rhodamine-conjugated secondary antibody. To assess whether ORF50 modifies the STAT pathway, we tested the effect of ORF50 on the expression of STAT-regulated reporter plasmids. The pSIE-luc reporter plasmid (high affinity mutant of the c-Fos SIS-inducible element, mutant m67) and the p3XLy6e-luc reporter plasmid (containing three copies of STAT-responsive elements (TTCCTGTAA) in the promoter of the murine surface antigen) are generally used as reporter plasmids for determining the activity of STAT family proteins (21Bromberg J.F. Wrzeszczynska M.H. Devgan G. Zhao Y. Pestell R.G. Albanese C. Darnell J.E. Cell. 1999; 98: 295-303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2487) Google Scholar, 22Bromberg J.F. Horvath C.M.

Biol. 1998; 18: 2545-2552Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar). The ptk-luc reporter plasmid, which contains the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase promoter, was used as a negative control. KSHV ORF50 stimulated pSIE-luc expression by 45- and 58-fold in 293T cells that had been transfected with 0.5 and 1 μg of an ORF50 expression plasmid, respectively. ORF50 also activated the ptk-luc reporter, but only by ∼5-fold (Fig.1 A). We then measured the effect of ORF50 on the p3XLy6e-luc reporter. Cotransfection of p3XLy6e-luc and an ORF50 expression plasmid resulted in a 1300-fold activation of luciferase activity (Fig. 1 B). To determine the domains of ORF50 necessary for STAT activation, we tested the transcriptional activation function of ORF50 deletion mutants whose functions have been described (10Gwack Y. Byun H. Hwang S. Lim C. Choe J. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 1909-1917Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The C301–691 mutant, which has the carboxyl-terminal half of ORF50, is unable to bind CBP and form an ORF50 homodimer (8Lukac D.M. Kirshner J.R. Ganem D. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 9348-9361Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Gwack Y. Byun H. Hwang S. Lim C. Choe J. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 1909-1917Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). However, the C301–691 mutant lost its ability to stimulate the STAT-regulated promoters in 293T cells (Fig. 1 B). The N626 mutant (containing amino acids 1–626 of ORF50), which binds to CBP and can form a homodimer, was still able to stimulate the above STAT-regulated reporter plasmids in 293T cells, but to a lower degree (300-fold). The N599 and N589 mutants were unable to stimulate the p3XLy6e-luc reporter in 293T cells. The LXXAA mutant, which has mutations in the CBP-binding motif, is unable to bind CBP and is also unable to repress p53-induced transcription and apoptosis (10Gwack Y. Byun H. Hwang S. Lim C. Choe J. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 1909-1917Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 11Gwack Y. Hwang S. Byun H. Lim C. Kim J.W. Choi E.J. Choe J. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 6245-6248Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). However, this mutant retained its ability to activate p3XLy6e-luc in 293T cells. We can assume that the CBP-binding domain (LXXLL motif) in the carboxyl terminus is not involved in the activation of the STAT-related promoters. From these results, we conclude that (i) the carboxyl-terminal transcriptional activation domain is necessary for the activation of STATs and (ii) the amino-terminal domain necessary for ORF50 homodimerization and CBP binding is also important for this stimulating function. To test whether ORF50 can activate STATs in other cell lines, we measured the activation of ptk-luc and p3XLy6e-luc in mouse fibroblast NIH3T3 cells and B cell lymphoma BJAB cells. In the presence of the ORF50 gene, the transcriptional activity of p3XLy6e-luc increased in a dose-dependent manner, whereas the activity of ptk-luc did not change (Fig. 1 C). The STAT-regulated promoters used in our experiments are known to be responsive to almost all STATs, but we narrowed our scope of research to STAT3 because it is the STAT protein most closely related to proliferation and apoptosis. When we either treated cells with interleukin 6 (IL-6) or transfected them with v-Src expression plasmids (two well characterized activators of the STAT3 pathway), ORF50 activation of p3XLy6e-luc expression was increased by 2.2- and 2-fold, respectively (Fig. 1 D). As a control, cells were either treated with IL-6 or transfected with v-Src expression vectors in the absence of STAT3 and ORF50. p3XLy6e-luc reporter gene expression was not much increased by IL-6 or v-Src. When cells transfected with STAT3 expression vectors were either treated with IL-6 or co-transfected with v-Src expression vectors, expression of the p3XLy6e-luc reporter was increased by 19- and 11-fold, respectively. The stimulating activity of ORF50 was reduced to one-third when cells were cotransfected with STAT3Y (Fig. 1 D), a dominant-negative mutant form of STAT3 that cannot be phosphorylated at tyrosine 705 and that cannot be homodimerized upon stimulation (22Bromberg J.F. Horvath C.M. Besser D. Lathem W.W. Darnell J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2553-2558Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar). Cotransfection of STAT3 and ORF50 stimulated the luciferase activity by 1.5–1.8-fold compared with ORF50 alone. The stimulating activity was also reduced to one-third with STAT3Y. In contrast to IL-6, interferon-γ, which activates the STAT1-related pathway, did not affect the stimulating activity of ORF50 (data not shown). These data suggest a relationship between ORF50 and STAT3 function, although we cannot exclude the possibility that ORF50 modifies the STAT-regulated reporters through interaction with other STAT family pathways. We next sought to determine whether ORF50 modifies the transcriptional activity of STAT3 by stimulating phosphorylation of STAT3. A FLAG-tagged STAT3 expression vector and either an ORF50 or v-Src expression vector were cotransfected into 293T cells. Whole cell extracts of the transfected cells were precipitated with anti-FLAG antibody, and the precipitates were analyzed by Western blotting with antibody to the phosphotyrosine residue within STAT3. v-Src did stimulate the tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3, whereas ORF50 did not (Fig.2 A). When STAT3 is tyrosine-phosphorylated and dimerizes, it acts as a transcriptional activator; thus, it is possible that ORF50 associates directly with STAT3 to modify its transcriptional activity. To test this hypothesis, we cotransfected 293T cells with a FLAG-tagged STAT3 expression vector and a vector that expresses either GFP alone or GFP/ORF50. Whole cell extracts were then precipitated with either anti-FLAG or anti-GFP antibody and analyzed by Western blotting (Fig. 2 B). Comparable amounts of STAT3 were precipitated with anti-FLAG antibody from both types of cell extracts. When the membrane that had been probed with anti-FLAG antibody was stripped and reprobed with anti-GFP antibody, GFP/ORF50 was detected, whereas the GFP protein was not detected in the precipitates. Thus, we conclude that ORF50 binds to STAT3 in vivo. We next determined the subcellular localization of these two proteins in our system. Because STAT3 exits as a latently cytoplasmic protein and ORF50 is known to be located in the nucleus (10Gwack Y. Byun H. Hwang S. Lim C. Choe J. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 1909-1917Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), we used confocal microscopy to determine the localization of STAT3 in the absence or presence of ORF50 in cotransfected 293T cells similar to those used for Fig. 2 B. GFP was dispersed in both the cytoplasm and nucleus in the transfected 293T cells (Fig.3 A). STAT3 was dispersed mostly in the cytoplasm, in accordance with previous observations (13Chatterjee-Kishore M. van den Akker F. Stark G.R. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 106-111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 14Darnell J.E. Science. 1997; 277: 1630-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (3358) Google Scholar, 15Bowman T. Garcia R. Turkson J. Jove R. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2474-2488Crossref PubMed Scopus (1581) Google Scholar, 16Bromberg J. Darnell J.E. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2468-2473Crossref PubMed Scopus (1041) Google Scholar). When these two images were superimposed, STAT3 and GFP did not show any relationship with respect to their location (i.e. they did not show any yellow color, which is indicative of co-localization in our system). GFP/ORF50 was located in the nucleus; and, interestingly, most of the STAT3 protein was also located in the nucleus in the presence of GFP/ORF50 even without IL-6 or cotransfection of v-Src expression vectors. To investigate further the co-localization of STAT3 and ORF50, we fractionated extracts from the transfected cells into cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions, and each fraction was analyzed by Western blotting (Fig. 3 B). In the absence of GFP/ORF50, STAT3 was localized chiefly in the cytoplasmic fraction. In contrast, nearly 50% of the cellular STAT3 protein was localized in the nucleus in the presence of GFP/ORF50. The amount of nuclear STAT3 in the presence of ORF50 was comparable to that observed in cells transfected with v-Src. These results suggest that ORF50 recruits STAT3 to the nucleus in the absence of any other signal, and this observation is consistent with the fact that ORF50 stimulates STAT-regulated promoters without any other stimulator of the STAT pathway. We next determined the effect of ORF50 on the dimerization of STAT3. ORF50 stimulated the transcriptional activity of STAT3 without affecting the phosphorylation of STAT3. However, STAT3 must be dimerized to bind to its specific DNA elements and thus to be an active transcriptional regulator. Furthermore, in most cases, STAT3 translocates into the nucleus after it forms a dimer. We cotransfected 293T cells with vectors expressing HA- and FLAG-tagged STAT3 and expression vectors for either ORF50 or the N589 mutant, which lost the activity to activate STAT-regulated promoters. The amounts of FLAG- and HA-tagged STAT3 in the extracts from the transfected cells were shown to be similar (Fig. 4A, leftand right panels). However, in the presence of ORF50, the amount of HA-tagged STAT3, which was associated with FLAG-tagged STAT3, was increased in a dose-dependent manner. N589 had no effect on the dimerization of STAT3 (Fig. 4 A, middle panel). To investigate further the effect of ORF50 on STAT3 dimerization, we conducted similar experiments in vitro. Extracts from cells transfected with either HA- or FLAG-tagged STAT3 were added to a purified preparation of ORF50 protein and immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG antibody. ORF50 simulated the association of the STAT3 proteins (Fig. 4 B). When the anti-FLAG precipitates were analyzed by Western blotting, we found that the bound fraction of HA-tagged STAT3 was increased, and ORF50 was shown to associate with these STAT3 dimers using anti-His antibody. To detect ORF50 and STAT3 interactionin vitro and to decipher the domains within ORF50 and STAT3 that participate in this interaction, we performed GST pull-down assays using in vitro translated STAT3 and GST/ORF50 fusion proteins (made with various ORF50 deletion mutants) (Fig.5 A). STAT3 bound to wild-type ORF50 and the ORF50 mutants containing the carboxyl-terminal transcriptional activation domain (C301–691, C581–691, and C607–691). N626, the carboxyl terminus (amino acids 627–691)-truncated mutant, could interact with STAT3. STAT3, however, did not bind to the amino terminus-containing ORF50 mutants (N599, N589, and N449). N599 and N589 also showed a reduction in the ORF50 transcriptional activation function (Fig. 1 B). Taken together, these results show that the STAT3-binding domain within ORF50 is in the carboxyl-terminal transcriptional activation domain of ORF50 (amino acids 607–626). We also performed GST pull-down assays usingin vitro translated ORF50 and GST-fused STAT3 functional domain fragments (Fig. 5 B). ORF50 bound to multiple regions within STAT3, including the amino-terminal domain, the DNA-binding domain, the linker domain, and the SH2 fragments, whereas it did not bind to the coiled-coil and transcriptional activation domain fragments. We have shown here that KSHV ORF50 affects the transcriptional activation of STAT3 through direct interaction. With respect to viral physiology, this observation is not surprising because many viral proteins such as EBV, human T cell lymphotrophic virus I, and herpesvirus saimiri modulate STAT-related activity to enhance viral replication. The ability of these viruses to stimulate STATs is closely related to viral oncogenic potential (17Migone T.S. Lin J.X. Cereseto A. Mulloy J.C. O'Shea J.J. Franchini G. Leonard W.J.

In this report, we focused on the ability of ORF50 to induce STAT3 activity, but it is possible that ORF50 also associates with other STAT family proteins and can affect their function. ORF50 interacts with multiple regions within STAT3 (Fig. 5,A and B). The amino-terminal domain in STAT3 is a protein/protein interaction domain, and this domain interacts with other dimeric forms of STAT and CBP (12Schindler C. Darnell J.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 621-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (1642) Google Scholar, 13Chatterjee-Kishore M. van den Akker F. Stark G.R.

The STAT3 DNA-binding domain interacts with a cellular transcriptional factor (c-Jun) to augment the transcriptional activity of STAT (24Schaefer T.S. Sanders L.K. Nathans D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9097-9101Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar, 25Zhang X. Wrzeszczynska M.H. Horvath C.M. Darnell J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7138-7146Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). The SH2 domain interacts with a phosphotyrosine residue of another STAT monomer to form the activated dimeric form of STAT proteins (12Schindler C. Darnell J.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 621-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (1642) Google Scholar, 13Chatterjee-Kishore M. van den Akker F. Stark G.R.

It is possible that ORF50 modulates these diverse protein/protein interactions, and an example of this is shown herein. The crystal structure of the dimeric STAT1 proteins (coiled-coil, DNA-binding, linker, and SH2 domains) has been published (26Chen X. Vinkemeier U. Zhao Y. Jeruzalmi D. Darnell J.E. Kuriyan J. Cell. 1998; 93: 827-839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar). According to the data, the coiled-coil domains project outward from the C-shaped core (DNA-binding, linker, and SH2 domains) around DNA, and the three domains in the core region are in close proximity to each other. This core region is also located in proximity to the other core region in the dimeric structure. So, it seems to be quite logical that ORF50 interacts only with the DNA-binding, linker, and SH2 domains, but not with the coiled-coil domain. It is possible that ORF50 could stabilize the dimeric form of STAT protein through the interaction between the core region of STAT and ORF50. ORF50 induced STAT3 dimerizationin vivo and in vitro without tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3. This ORF50-induced dimerization of STAT3 seems to be related to the STAT3-stimulating activity of ORF50 because the carboxyl terminus- deleted mutant N589, which completely lost its stimulating activity, also lost its ability to induce STAT3 dimerization. Fig. 6 shows the possible mechanism of ORF50-induced STAT3 activation. A STAT3 monomer is activated with v-Src or IL-6 to form a dimer, translocates into the nucleus, and interacts with the specific DNA elements (12Schindler C. Darnell J.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 621-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (1642) Google Scholar, 13Chatterjee-Kishore M. van den Akker F. Stark G.R. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 106-111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 14Darnell J.E. Science. 1997; 277: 1630-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (3358) Google Scholar, 15Bowman T. Garcia R. Turkson J. Jove R. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2474-2488Crossref PubMed Scopus (1581) Google Scholar, 16Bromberg J. Darnell J.E. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2468-2473Crossref PubMed Scopus (1041) Google Scholar). ORF50 recruited STAT3 to the nucleus and induced the dimerization of STAT3 without any additional signal. When cells do encounter other signals such as v-Src and IL-6, a large proportion of STAT3 molecules are located in the nucleus, and this may increase the probability that ORF50 will meet a STAT3 protein. Another possible mechanism of ORF50-induced translocation of STAT3 is that ORF50 could inhibit the interaction of CRM1 and STAT3 because ORF50 and CRM1 both interact with STAT3 at its DNA-binding domain. CRM1 is involved in the nuclear export of STAT proteins and serves to inactivate the STAT pathway (27McBride K.M. McDonald C. Reich N.C. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6196-6206Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is possible that ORF50 could inhibit the STAT3/CRM1 interaction and induce the retention of STAT3 in the nucleus. KSHV ORF50 is a viral transcriptional factor that activates transcription of many viral genes to induce the lytic phase of KSHV. ORF50 modifies the activity of cellular transcription factors such as p53 through association with CBP (10Gwack Y. Byun H. Hwang S. Lim C. Choe J. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 1909-1917Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 11Gwack Y. Hwang S. Byun H. Lim C. Kim J.W. Choi E.J. Choe J. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 6245-6248Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In addition, the expression of ORF50 is closely associated with the development of KSHV-related diseases (9Chen J. Ueda K. Sakakibara S. Okuno T. Parravicini C. Corbellino M. Yamanishi K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4119-4124Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). We have shown here that ORF50 also has a role in the modulation of cell growth.

https://openalex.org/W2045702782,"In this study, we describe the characterization of a gene encoding a novel Krüppel-like protein, named Glis2. Glis2 encodes a relatively proline-rich, basic 55.8-kDa protein. Its five tandem Cys2-His2 zinc finger motifs exhibit the highest homology to those of members of the Gli and Zic subfamilies of Krüppel-like proteins. Confocal microscopic analysis demonstrated that Glis2 localizes to the nucleus. Analysis of the genomic structure of the Glis2 gene showed that it is composed of 6 exons separated by 5 introns spanning a genomic region of more than 7.5 kb. Fluorescence in situ hybridization mapped the mouse Glis2 gene to chromosome 16A3-B1. Northern blot analysis showed that the Glis2 gene encodes a 3.8-kb transcript that is most abundant in adult mouse kidney. By in situ hybridization, expression was localized to somites and neural tube, and during metanephric development predominantly to the ureteric bud, precursor of the collecting duct, and inductor of nephronic tubule formation. One-hybrid analysis using Glis2 deletion mutants identified a novel activation function (AF) at the N terminus. The activation of transcription through this AF domain was totally suppressed by two repressor functions just downstream from the AF. One of the repressor functions is contained within the first zinc finger motif. The level of transcriptional activation and repression varied with the cell line tested, which might be due to differences in cell type-specific expression of co-activators and co-repressors. Our results suggest that Glis2 behaves as a bifunctional transcriptional regulator. Both the activation and repressor functions may play an important role in the regulation of gene expression during embryonic development.

These proteins generally contain, in addition to a DNA-binding domain, one or more domains involved in activation or repression of transcription. DNA-binding domains often consist of conserved motifs, such as helix-turn-helix, helix-loop-helix, and zinc finger motifs (1Nelson H.C. Curr. Opin.

In proteins containing zinc finger motifs, the residues in the motif fold around a central zinc ion with a tetrahedral arrangement of cysteine and/or histidine metal ligands. Zinc finger proteins constitute one of the biggest families of transcriptional factors and can be divided into many subclasses based on, among other things, the number and type of zinc fingers they contain. For example, members of the nuclear receptor superfamily contain two Cys4-type zinc fingers (4Evans R.M. Science. 1988; 240: 889-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (6276) Google Scholar, 5Schwabe J.W.

These proteins contain in addition a conserved consensus sequence, (T/S)GEKP(Y/F)X, between adjacent zinc finger motifs. Members of the Krüppel-like zinc finger family have important regulatory functions during embryonic development and have been implicated in a variety of diseases (9Turner J. Crossley M.

The Gli protein subclass of Krüppel-like zinc finger proteins consists of three members, Gli1, Gli2, and Gli3 (10Kinzler K.W. Bigner S.H. Bigner D.D. Trent J.M. Law M.L. O'Brien S.J. Wong A.J.

Gli1 has been demonstrated to function as a proto-oncogene. Aberrant expression and amplification of Gli1 is associated with basal cell carcinomas of the skin, sarcomas, and glioblastomas (10Kinzler K.W. Bigner S.H. Bigner D.D. Trent J.M. Law M.L.

These proteins have been reported to play an essential role in body pattern formation during embryonic development (27Aruga J. Minowa O. Yaginuma H. Kuno J. Nagai T. Noda T. Mikoshiba K. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 284-293Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Kitaguchi T. Nagai T. Nakata K. Aruga J. Mikoshiba K. Development. 2000; 127: 4787-4795PubMed Google Scholar, 29Nagai T. Aruga J.

S. A. 1997; 94: 11980-11985Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). In this study, we determine the genomic structure of the mouseGli-similar 2 (Glis2) gene, also referred to as NKL (31Lamar E. Kintner C. Goulding M. Development. 2001; 128: 1335-1346PubMed Google Scholar), encoding a novel member of the Krüppel-like zinc finger family. Glis2 is most closely related to members of the Gli and Zic subfamilies of Krüppel-like zinc finger proteins. As members of the Gli and Zic family, Glis2 contains five Cys2-His2 zinc finger motifs and functions as a nuclear protein. Analysis of the genomic structure of Glis2showed that it consists of 6 exons and 5 introns. The splice sites within the zinc finger domain are different from those ofGli genes in agreement with the conclusion that Glis2 forms a separate subfamily. Murine and human Glis2 mapped to chromosome 16A3-B1 and 16p13.3, respectively (32Zhang F. Jetten A.M. Gene (Amst.). 2001; 280: 49-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Of the adult mouse tissues examined, Glis2 was found to be most highly expressed in kidney. In situ hybridization analysis localized Glis2 mRNA expression during metanephric development predominantly to the ureteric bud, precursor of the collecting duct, and inductor of nephronic tubule formation. These results suggest a possible role for Glis2 in the regulation of kidney morphogenesis. Its chromosomal localization and its expression kidney is of particular interest because the 16p13.3 locus has been implicated in several kidney diseases in humans (33Calvet J.P. J. Nephrol. 1998; 11: 24-34PubMed Google Scholar, 34Yamashita Y. Yokoyama M. Kobayashi E. Takai S. Hino O. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 275: 134-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Analysis of its transcriptional activity using mono-hybrid and deletion mutant analysis identified a strong transactivation function (AF) in the N terminus of Glis2. The activation of transcription through this domain was totally suppressed by two repressor functions just downstream from the AF. One of the repressor functions was retained in a region that encompasses the first zinc finger motif. Both activation and repressor functions may play an important role in the regulation of gene expression during embryonic development and adult kidney. During screening of a λTriplEx cDNA library (4 × 105independent plaques) prepared from mouse kidney RNA (CLONTECH) with a Glis1 cDNA probe, 2Y.-S. Kim and A. M. Jetten, manuscript in preparation. a cDNA clone was isolated containing a 1.5-kb-long insert with a sequence that was different from Glis1. The insert encoded a region highly homologous to the C2H2-type zinc finger motifs present in Glis1 and a flanking region that exhibited low homology to Glis1. GenBankTM searches indicated that the insert encoded a novel gene that is different from but related to Glis1. We named this gene Glis2. To obtain the 3′- and 5′-ends of mGlis2, RACE was performed using a Marathon cDNA Amplification kit (CLONTECH) following the manufacturer's protocol. Marathon ready cDNA (CLONTECH) from mouse kidney was used as template. The following adapter and Glis2-specific primers were used in 5′-RACE: adapter primers AP1 (5′-CCATCCTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGC) and AP2 (5′-ACTCACTATAGGGCTCGAGCGGC); mGlis2-specific primers GSP2 (5′-GGGCAGCAGGGTTCGGGATGATGAT) and NGSP2 (5′-CCCGCTGACATAGGAGCCACTGTCA). Primers MM1 (5′-CCACCATGCACTCCTTGGA) and MM2 (5′-AATTCCCAAGTGTGGGCCTAT) were used in PCR to amplify full-length Glis2 using mouse kidney cDNA as template. The products obtained by PCR were subcloned into pGEM-T vector. Plasmids were purified using Wizard miniprep or midiprep kits from Promega. Manual sequencing was performed using the Sequenase Quick-denature plasmid sequencing kit (Amersham Biosciences). Automatic sequencing was carried out using a Dynamic ET Terminator Cycle Sequencing Ready reaction kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and an ABI Prism 377 automatic sequencer. DNA and deduced protein sequences were analyzed by the seqWEB and MacVector sequence analysis software packages. Total RNA was isolated from 16 different mouse tissues using Trizol (Sigma) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Total RNA (30 μg) was electrophoresed through formaldehyde 1.2% agarose gel, blotted to Hybond N+ membrane (Amersham Biosciences), and UV cross-linked. The expression of the mGlis2 gene was also examined by RT-PCR using total RNA (1 μg) from different mouse tissues as template and ZFP1 (5′-TTCTGGTGGGGCT CTGCAC) and ZFP2 (5′-GCACTGAGGTCAAGGGGGC) as primers. The RT-PCR was carried out at the following conditions: 45 min at 48 °C and 2 min at 94 °C (1 cycle), followed by 0.5 min at 94 °C, 1 min at 60 °C, and 2 min at 68 °C (25 cycles). Finally, after a 7-min incubation at 68 °C, samples were analyzed on a TBE gel (0.8%) and transferred to a HyBond-N+ membrane. The blots were hybridized to a32P-labeled probe for Glis2. Hybridizations were performed at 68 °C for 1 h, and the membranes were then washed twice with 2× SSC, 0.1% SDS at room temperature for 30 min and 0.1% SSC, 0.1% SDS at 50 °C for 40 min. Autoradiography was carried out with Hyperfilm-MP Amersham Biosciences) at −70 °C. Tissues from 16- and 19-dpc rat metanephrol were fixed in 4% buffered paraformaldehyde overnight and embedded in paraffin following ethanol dehydration. Hybridizations were performed according to Wilkinson and Green (35Wilkinson D. Green J. Copp A.J. Cokroft D.L. In Situ Hybridization and the Three-dimensional Reconstruction of Series Sections. Postimplantation Mammalian Embryos. Oxford University Press, London1990: 155-171Google Scholar), using antisense or sense 35S-labeled riboprobes generated from two different plasmids encoding either the 5′-end (nucleotides 21–515) or the 3′-end (nucleotides 1127–1562) of the cDNA sequence (35Wilkinson D.

Two primer sets were used to screen by PCR a library of BAC vectors containing 50–100-kb inserts of mouse genomic DNA. One primer set consisting of MGE1P (5′-CTATTTGGATGGTGTCCCA) and MGE1R (5′-ATCGACACACCGCTGCTTG) amplified a 150-bp fragment of mouse genomic DNA. The other primer set consisting of MGE4P (5′-TCAGATCATCATCCCGAACC) and MGE4R (5′-CGTCTTGTGATTTTCCAGGC) amplified a 300-bp fragment of mouse genomic DNA. Two positive clones were obtained. BAC vector DNA was isolated using a KB-500 kit from Incyte Genomics. DNA was digested with several restriction enzymes, including BamHI, HindIII, EcoRI,XbaI, and XhoI, and fragments were analyzed by Southern analysis using different regions of the mGlis2 cDNA as probes. One of two BAC vector clones that contained the full coding region of Glis2 was used for further investigation. TheHindIII fragments hybridizing to the Glis2 probes were cut from the gel, purified with QIAEX II kit (Qiagen), and subcloned into pZErO-1 vector. One 7.0-kb HindIII fragment containing all the exons of Glis2 was sequenced. The regional chromosomal localization was determined by FISH using a 7-kb fragment of genomic DNA containing the Glis2 gene as a probe. FISH was carried out by Incyte Genomics. DNA from the mouse clone was labeled with digoxigenin dUTP by nick translation. Labeled probe was combined with sheared mouse DNA and hybridized to normal metaphase chromosomes derived from mouse embryonic stem cells in a solution containing 50% formamide, 10% dextran sulfate, and 2× SSC. Specific hybridization signals were detected by incubating the hybridized slides in fluoresceinated anti-digoxigenin antibodies followed by counterstaining with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. The initial experiment resulted in specific labeling of the proximal region of a small sized chromosome that was believed to be chromosome 16 on the basis of 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole staining. A second analysis was conducted in which a probe that is specific for the telomeric region of chromosome 16 was co-hybridized with the Glis2 genomic fragment. This experiment resulted in the specific labeling of the telomere and the proximal portion of chromosome 16. The reporter plasmid pG5-CAT containing five copies of the GAL4 upstream activating sequence (UAS) upstream of the E1B minimal promoter and referred to as (UAS)5-CAT, pM, encoding Gal4(DBD), and the pCMVβ reporter vector were purchased from CLONTECH. The reporter plasmid pFR-LUC (referred to as (UAS)5-LUC) was obtained from Stratagene. The different pM-Glis2 deletion mutants were created by placing the Gal4-DNA binding domain at the N terminus of various Glis2 fragments. These fragments were generated by PCR using primers based on the polylinks in the pM vector. Glis2-specific 5′- and 3′-primers included either aBamHI or HindIII restriction site, respectively, to allow the PCR fragments to be subcloned into the BamHI and HindIII sites of the pM vector. Details on the length of each deletion are described in the text and figures. pcDNA4-Glis2 was constructed by inserting the full-length mGlis2cDNA, generated by PCR, into BamHI and XbaI sites of pcDNA4/HisMax C (Invitrogen). pEGFP-Glis2 was generated by cloning full-length Glis2 into XhoI andBamHI sites of the pEGFP-C3 vector (CLONTECH). The plasmid pEGFP-Glis2ΔN containing an N-terminal truncated Glis2 (from Val30) and pEGFP-Glis2ΔC (containing Val30 to Ser322) was generated by PCR. The integrity of all constructs was confirmed by restriction digestion and automatic DNA sequencing. pEGFP-Glis2, pEGFP-Glis2ΔN, pEGFP-Glis2ΔC, or pEGFP-C3 plasmid were transfected into CV-1 cells using FuGENE 6. After 30 h of culture, cells were examined in a Zeiss confocal microscopy LSM 510 NLO (Zeiss, Thornwood, NY). The excitation and emission frequencies were 488 and 505 nm, respectively. Differential interference contrast (DIC) images were obtained simultaneously with fluorescence images. Green monkey kidney fibroblast CV-1, Chinese hamster ovary CHO, dog kidney epithelial MDCK, and transformed human kidney 293 cells were obtained from ATCC and routinely maintained in DMEM or Ham's F-12 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were plated in 6-well dishes at 2 × 105 cells/well (6 × 105 cells for 293 cells) and 20 h later co-transfected (1.0–1.9 μg DNA total) with 0.2–0.3 μg of (UAS)5-LUC or (UAS)5-CAT, 0–1.6 μg of the pM-Glis2 plasmid indicated, 1.4 to 0 μg of pZeoSV, and 0.2 μg of pCMVβ or β-actin-LUC expression plasmid, which served as an internal control to monitor transfection efficiency. CV-1, CHO, and MDCK cells were transfected in Opti-MEM (Invitrogen) using 3.0 μl of FuGENE 6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) although 293 cells were transfected using 10 μl of PolyFect transfection reagent (Qiagen). Cells were incubated for 48 h and then assayed for β-galactosidase and luciferase activity. The level of β-galactosidase activity was determined using a luminescent β-galactosidase detection kit (CLONTECH) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Luciferase activity was assayed with a luciferase assay kit from Promega. Transfections were performed in triplicate, and each experiment was repeated at least two times. The level of CAT protein was determined by the CAT enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's instructions. During screening of a mouse kidney cDNA library with a probe for Glis1, 2a 1.5-kb cDNA fragment was cloned encoding a novel zinc finger protein, referred to as Glis2, that was related to but different from Glis1. The full-length coding region of Glis2 was obtained by assembling fragments obtained by cDNA library screening and 5′-RACE. The genomic structure of the Glis2 gene was determined from a 7.5-kb HindIII genomic fragment as described under “Experimental Procedures.” This analysis revealed that theGlis2 gene spans more than 7.5 kb and is composed of 6 exons separated by 5 introns (Fig. 1). A summary of the various sizes of the exons and introns and the sequence of the splice junctions is shown in TableI. The sequences of these junctions are consistent with the consensus A62G77g100t100a60a74g88for the 5′-donor and y87ny97a100g100G55(where y is pyrimidine) for the 3′-acceptor site for known splice sites within eukaryotic genes (37Mount S.M.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 8125-8148Crossref PubMed Scopus (4148) Google Scholar). The open reading frame encodes for a protein of 521 amino acids with a calculated mass of 55.8 kDa. Glis2 is a basic protein with a theoretical pI of 9.03 and is relatively proline-rich with 13% of its residues consisting of proline. Glis2 contains a zinc finger domain (ZFD) consisting of five tandem zinc finger motifs with the consensus sequenceX-Cys-X 2,4-Cys-X 12,15-His-X 3,4-His-X(Fig. 2). The zinc finger motifs are connected by sequences that exhibit different degrees of homology with the consensus motif (T/S)GEKP(Y/F)X, typically found as interfinger spacer in members of the Krüppel-like family (3Schuh R.

The ZFD of Glis2 exhibited the highest identity (49–57%) with members of the Gli and Zic subfamilies of Krüppel-like proteins (Fig. 2,A and B) (29Nagai T. Aruga J. Takada S. Gunther T. Sporle R.

The 3rd and 5th zinc finger motif of Glis2 are most highly conserved with those of Gli proteins, exhibiting 70 and 88% identity, respectively. Analysis of the secondary structure of the Glis2 ZFD using the GOR3 secondary structure prediction method indicated that the second half of each zinc finger motif consists of an α-helix (Fig. 2 C) and therefore resembles the structure of the zinc fingers present in Gli proteins (6Klug A. Schwabe J.W. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 597-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar). Little homology was observed between Glis2 and Gli and Zic proteins in regions outside the zinc finger domain. To examine the cellular localization of Glis2, CV-1 cells were transfected with pEGFP-Glis2 plasmid DNA encoding the fusion protein EGFP-Glis2(full-length) and its cellular localization analyzed by confocal microscopy. This analysis demonstrated that EGFP-Glis2 is primarily localized to the nucleus (Fig. 3 A). The spatial distribution of Glis2 occurred in a typical speckled pattern as observed for many transcription factors (42Dundr M. Misteli T. Biochem. J. 2001; 356: 297-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar), and no fluorescence was observed within the nucleoli. Although PEPSORT prediction II analysis of the Glis2 sequence did not identify any nuclear localization signal, visual inspection of the Glis2 sequence showed a sequence between residues 21 and 26 with homology to the nuclear localization signal consensus sequence XXK(K/R)X(K/R (43Powers M.A. Forbes D.J. Cell. 1994; 79: 931-934Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). However, this sequence appeared not to be important for the nuclear localization of Glis2, because EGFP-Glis2ΔN, in which the N terminus up to Val30 was deleted, still localized exclusively to the nucleus (Fig. 3 B), as did EGFP-Glis2ΔC in which the C terminus was deleted (Fig. 3 C). These observations demonstrate that neither the N nor the C terminus is required for nuclear localization of Glis2 sugg"

EMAP II has been first found in the culture medium of murine methylcholanthrene A-induced fibrosarcoma cells based on its capacity to induce activation of tissue factor in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) (2Kao J.

Murine methylcholanthrene A fibrosarcomas exhibit spontaneous vascular insufficiency manifested by a heterogeneous pattern of thrombohemorrhage and central necrosis, providing an ideal starting point for isolation of tumor-derived mediators that perturb the vasculature (3Old L.

In addition to the induction of tissue factor-dependent coagulation on ECs and monocytes, EMAP II up-regulates endothelial E-selectin and P-selectin expression and induces the release of von Willebrand factor. It is also chemotactic for neutrophils and monocytes and induces release of myeloperoxidase activity from neutrophil. In vivo, local injection of EMAP II into a mouse footpad evokes an acute inflammatory response characterized by edema and neutrophil-rich infiltrates. EMAP II is cleaved from p43 at the amino acid motif ASTD by caspase-7 activated in apoptotic cells (7Behrensdorf H.A. van de Craen M. Knies U.E. Vandenabeele P. Clauss M.

In addition, EMAP II mRNA is most abundant at the sites of tissue undergoing apoptosis in mouse embryo and human tissue (10Zhang F. Schwarz M.A. Dev.

Therefore, p43/EMAP II could be a good candidate for the chemokine recruiting leukocytes and monocytes to cells undergoing apoptosis to remove apoptotic corps. EMAP II also has an antiangiogenic property that targets rapidly growing vascular beds. EMAP II is capable of sensitizing tumors resistant to the anti-tumor effects of tumor necrosis factor (12Marvin M. Libutti S.K. Kayton M. Kao J. Hayward J. Grikscheit T. Fan Y. Brett J. Weinberg A.

Turner E.S. Libutti S.K. Cytokine. 2000; 12: 992-1000Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In addition, EMAP II inhibited EC proliferation, vasculogenesis, and neovessel formation (16Berger A.C. Alexander H.R. Tang G. Wu P.S. Hewitt S.M. Turner E. Kruger E. Figg W.D. Grove A. Kohn E. Stern D. Libutti S.K. Microvasc. Res. 2000; 60: 70-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). EMAP II also suppresses the growth of primary and metastatic tumors by anti-angiogenic properties without toxicity to normal organ (17Schwarz M.A. Kandel J. Brett J. Li J. Hayward J. Schwarz R.E.

Exposure of growing cultured capillary endothelium to EMAP II induces apoptosis (18Liu S.H. Gottsch J.D. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1999; 40: 3152-3159PubMed Google Scholar), which is magnified by concomitant hypoxia. These effects on endothelium implied that EMAP II might play an important role in regulating tumor vasculature. However, little is known about the molecular mechanism(s) by which EMAP II functions to regulate endothelial cell behavior. Although we have recently shown that p43, not EMAP II, may be a real cytokine at physiological conditions (19Ko Y.G. Park H. Kim T. Lee J.W. Park S.G. Seol W. Kim J.E. Lee W.H. Kim S.H. Park J.E. Kim S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23028-23033Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), EMAP II was functionally equivalent to p43 in all the aspects we have tested (data not shown). In addition, EMAP II is easier to purify than p43 because it is produced at higher yield and is more soluble. Thus, we used EMAP II in most of the experiments in this work for convenience. We found that the EMAP II-binding protein on the serum-starved cells was the α subunit of ATP synthase (α-ATP synthase). Interaction of EMAP II with α-ATP synthase was confirmed using ELISA, pull down assays, flow cytometry, confocal microscopy, and competitive cellular binding. Furthermore, proliferation assays suggested that both EMAP II and anti-α-ATP synthase antibodies inhibit EC proliferation, and the inhibitory effect of EMAP II on the EC proliferation was abrogated in the presence of soluble α-ATP synthase. These results imply that EMAP II binding to the α-ATP synthase may be involved in the inhibition of the EC proliferation. CEM, SB, and THP-1 were cultured in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated (56 °C for 30 min) fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) and antibiotics at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Bovine aorta endothelial cells (BAECs) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 20% fetal bovine serum and retained for up to six passages. Serum-starved (quiescent) cells were prepared by culturing in the medium containing 0.2% fetal bovine serum for 1–2 days. The cells were washed in cold PBS with 1% BSA and 0.1% sodium azide and then incubated with 5 μg/ml biotin-conjugated EMAP II, 10 μg/ml biotin-conjugated p43, and 50 μg/ml polyclonal antibodies containing anti-α-ATP synthase antibodies for 1 h at 4 °C. Binding inhibition experiments were performed by staining with biotin-conjugated EMAP II or p43, which was preincubated with an excess of recombinant α-ATP synthase (10 μg/ml). After two additional washes, FITC-avidin (Pierce) or FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Sigma) were added to each sample and incubated on ice for 30 min in the dark. After the last wash, the cells were resuspended in PBS, and viable cells from each sample were analyzed on a PASIIIi flow cytometer (Partec Gmbh). The serum-starved CEM cells were suspended in PBS and adhered to poly-l-lysine-coated glass coverslips. Cells were washed with ice-cold PBS and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature. After the fixed cells were washed with PBS, the cells were blocked with 1% BSA (Sigma) in PBS for 30 min. The cells were then incubated with 5 μg/ml biotin-conjugated EMAP II in PBS containing 0.5% BSA for 1 h 30 min. Control staining were performed with 10 μg/ml biotin-conjugated BSA. Binding inhibition experiments were performed by staining with 5 μg/ml biotin-conjugated EMAP II, which was preincubated with an excess of recombinant α-ATP synthase (10 μg/ml). After washing with PBS, the cells were incubated with the FITC-conjugated avidin (Pierce) for 1 h in the dark. The stained cells were examined using DM IRB/E confocal microscopy (Leica Microsystems). CEM cells were harvested, washed with ice-cold PBS, and suspended in PBS (pH 8.0). Biotin labeling was performed by incubating cell suspensions with 0.5 mg/ml biotin for 1 h at room temperature. Total lysates from N-hydroxysuccinimidobiotin (Pierce)-labeled CEM were prepared by lysing the cells in ice-cold lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 140 mm NaCl, 0.025% sodium azide, 1 mm iodoacetamide, 0.2 unit/ml aprotinin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals)) and pelleting to remove cellular debris by centrifuging at 12,000 rpm for 30 min. Plasma membrane extracts from sulfo-N-hydroxysuccinimide-LC-biotin (Pierce)-labeled CEM were prepared by ultracentrifugation (20Young T.N. Pizzo S.V. Stack M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 999-1002Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). After preclearing, each sample was incubated with EMAP II-Sepharose for 2 h at 4 °C and washed five times in lysis buffer. After extraction of precipitated proteins by boiling, the samples were electrophoresed by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (Gelman). The membranes were blocked for 1 h in 3% skimmed milk and subsequently probed with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated avidin (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). The precipitated proteins were visualized using a DAB detection kit according to the manufacturer's instruction (DAKO). For purification of EMAP II-binding protein(s), membrane extracts from the serum-starved CEM were incubated with a EMAP II-Sepharose column and eluted with 20 mm glycine (pH 2.5). The eluates were concentrated by Speed-vac, electrophoresed on SDS-PAGE, and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. The resulting band were excised tightly, washed twice with 50% acetonitrile, and digested. The amino acid sequences of digested peptides were analyzed by MS/MS spectrometry at the Harvard Microchemistry facility. The cDNA encoding the full-length human α-ATP synthase, EMAP II, and p43 were produced by reverse transcription-PCR from total RNA of the CEM cells as a template. The cDNAs were amplified by PCR between the two specific oligonucleotides. The primers used were 5′-ACATATGCTGCCGTGCGCGTTG and 5′-TCTCGAGAGCTTCAAATCCAGCC for α-ATP synthase, 5′-ACATATGGCAAATAATGATGC and 5′-TCTCGAGTTATTTGATTCCAC for p43, and 5′-ACATATGGACTCTAAGCCAATAGAT and the same primer of p43 downstream for EMAP II. The PCR products were cleaved withNdeI and XhoI designed into each of the primers and inserted into the same site of pET28a encoding the His-tail (Novagen). The resulting plasmids were introduced intoEscherichia coli BL21 (DE3) and induced with IPTG. The His-tagged proteins of α-ATP synthase, EMAP II, and p43 were purified using nickel affinity chromatography following the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). Each purified protein was used to raise specific polyclonal mouse antibodies. After the third immunization, polyclonal anti-EMAP II antibodies were purified from mouse antiserum using an EMAP II-Sepharose column. The total IgG containing polyclonal anti-α-ATP synthase antibodies was purified from the mouse α-ATP synthase antiserum by a protein A affinity chromatography according to the manufacturer's protocol (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.), and the antibody specificity was confirmed by immunoblotting of the proteins extracted from the starved CEM cells. Binding of EMAP II to α-ATP synthase was determined by ELISA. Briefly, 96-well microtiter plates (Maxisorp F96; Nunc) were coated with 200 ng/well recombinant α-ATP synthase or heat-inactivated form in 50 mm carbonate buffer (pH 9.6) and incubated overnight at 4 °C. After washing with PBS, the remaining sites were blocked with PBS containing 1% BSA (Sigma) for 30 min at room temperature. Binding studies were performed with increasing amounts of biotin-conjugated EMAP II, p43, and heat-inactivated forms of them (0–8 μg/ml) for 2 h at room temperature. For binding inhibition studies with antibodies, biotin-labeled EMAP II (250 ng/ml) containing a range of concentrations of anti-EMAP II antibodies was applied to microtiter wells coated with α-ATP synthase. In the case of antibody directed against α-ATP synthase, coated α-ATP synthase was incubated with serial diluted polyclonal anti-α-ATP synthase antibodies before adding biotin-labeled EMAP II (250 ng/ml). The plates were washed and incubated with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated streptavidin (Pierce) diluted in PBS, 0.1% BSA, Tween 20 (1:2000) for 1 h at room temperature. The plates were washed, and then 100 μl of phosphatase substrate (p-nitrophenyl phosphate in a carbonate buffer, pH 9.6) was added to each well. The absorbance was read at 405 nm using an Emax microplate reader (Molecular Devices). Equal amounts of recombinant proteins prepared from E. coli were incubated with protein A-Sepharose beads in binding buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 140 mm NaCl, 0.025% NaN3) with or without polyclonal antibodies containing anti-α-ATP synthase antibodies at 4 °C for 3 h. The beads were then washed extensively with binding buffer containing 0.1% Triton X-100, resuspended in SDS-PAGE buffer, boiled for 5 min, and resolved on 12% SDS-PAGE, followed by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining. The presence of α-ATP synthase, EMAP II, and p43 was subsequently confirmed by Western blotting with their specific antibodies. BAECs were seeded into 96-well tissue culture plates at a density of 10,000 cells/well in medium depleted of fetal bovine serum overnight to allow the cells to become quiescent. Fresh medium containing 20% fetal bovine serum was added to the wells along with 0.25 μm EMAP II, 0.25 μm p43, 0.25 μm α-ATP synthase, and 6.25, 25, and 100 μg/ml polyclonal antibodies containing anti-α-ATP synthase antibodies. Cell density was measured after 24 h by using the CellTiter 96 aqueous assay kit (Promega). The absorbance of formazan was quantitated on an Emax microplate reader at a wavelength of 490 nm according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega). The absorbance values were used to calculate the percent proliferation of the cells. To understand the working mechanism of p43, it is important to identify the cell surface molecule that can associate with p43. In the experiments, we decided to use EMAP II instead of p43 because EMAP II is functionally equivalent to p43 but shows higher solubility. We first searched for the optimal condition for the binding of EMAP II to the cell with high efficiency. To find such a condition, we applied various treatments (lipopolysaccharide, DNA damaging agents, cytokine treatment, and serum starvation) to the THP-1 cells and analyzed the cell binding of EMAP II by flow cytometry. Among them, serum starvation dramatically increased binding of EMAP II to the THP-1 compared with the cells grown in medium containing 10% FBS (Fig.1 A, upper). Increased EMAP II binding by serum starvation was further investigated in the different cells to confirm whether the result was a monocyte-specific response. Starvation-induced EMAP II binding was also detected in all of the human T cell line (CEM, Fig. 1 A,middle), human B cell line (SB, Fig. 1 A,lower), hepatocellular carcinoma line (Chang), breast cancer cell line (SK-BR-3), and RAW 264.7 (data not shown). These data suggested that starvation universally increases the binding of EMAP II on the cell surface. To further confirm the possibility, the binding of EMAP II on the cell surface was analyzed by confocal microscopy using biotin-conjugated EMAP II. The staining with EMAP II was mainly detected on the surface of CEM cells cultured in the serum-free medium, confirming that the binding of EMAP II was increased on the cell surface by serum starvation (Fig. 1 B). We suspected that the enhanced EMAP II binding to the serum-starved cells might result from the increase of cell surface molecules that can associate with EMAP II. We thus used the serum starvation as an experimental condition to isolate the EMAP II-binding surface protein(s). The cell surface molecules responsible for the binding of EMAP II to the serum-starved CEM were precipitated with EMAP II-linked Sepharose. Four proteins with approximate molecular masses of 34, 43, 55, and 90 kDa were precipitated from the whole cell lysates (Fig. 2 A, left). However, only one protein with an approximate molecular mass of 55 kDa was eluted from the precipitates of plasma membrane fraction obtained from the serum-starved CEM cells (Fig. 2 A,right). These results suggested that the 55-kDa protein could be one of the EMAP II-binding proteins on the cell surface. To identify the EMAP II-binding protein, affinity purification was performed by subjecting the serum-starved CEM plasma membranes to an EMAP II-Sepharose column. Two bands with molecular masses between 50 and 60 kDa were purified from the column (Fig. 2 B). The amino acid sequences of the peptides digested from the affinity-purified protein were analyzed by MS/MS spectrometry. The EMAP II-binding membrane protein was identified as the α subunit of ATP synthase with a molecular mass of 55 kDa (Fig.3). The expression of α/β subunits of ATP synthase has been reported on the plasma membrane of HUVEC and several tumor lines in the previous studies (21Moser T.L. Stack M.S. Asplin I. Enghild J.J. Hφjrup P. Everitt L. Hubchak S. Schnaper H.W. Pizzo S.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2811-2816Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar, 22Das B. Mondragon M.O.H. Sadeghian M. Hatcher V.B. Norin A.J. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 273-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Therefore, we surmised that the EMAP II-binding protein on the surface of the starved CEM could be the α subunit of ATP synthase. We first cloned the α-ATP synthase gene from the total RNA of CEM cells and then expressed recombinant human α-ATP synthase in E. coli. To investigate the surface expression of α-ATP synthase, mouse polyclonal antibodies specific to the human α-ATP synthase were prepared using a protein A-Sepharose column. Their antigenic specificity was determined by immunoblotting of the proteins extracted from the starved CEM cells. The antibodies showed the specificity to their antigen (data not shown). To determine the surface expression of α-ATP synthase, CEM cells were analyzed by flow cytometry using this polyclonal antibody. α-ATP synthase was detected only in the serum-starved cells but not in the cells grown in 10% FBS medium (Fig. 4 A). In addition, the cell surface localization was further investigated by nonpermeabilized confocal microscopy, and α-ATP synthase was detected in the serum-starved cell surface (data not shown). These results showed that the α subunit of ATP synthase could be expressed on the surface of cells cultured under serum-free conditions. To see whether the same result is obtained with the EMAP II precursor, p43, we repeated the experiment with p43. Similar to EMAP II, p43 bound only to the serum-starved CEM cells but not in the 10% FBS (data not shown). To determine the interaction of EMAP II and p43 with α-ATP synthase, binding of EMAP II or p43 to the recombinant α-ATP synthase was measured by ELISA. EMAP II and p43 bound to the recombinant α-ATP synthase in a dose-dependent manner, and their bindings were saturable at high concentrations (Fig.5 A). However, the heat-inactivated EMAP II and p43 lost the binding activity, indicating that the native conformation of EMAP II and p43 is important in their binding to α-ATP synthase. On the other hand, the interaction of EMAP II and p43 with heat-inactivated α-ATP synthase was decreased slightly, suggesting that the α-ATP synthase is heat-stable or the conformation is less critical for the interaction with EMAP II and p43 (Fig. 5 B). In contrast, EMAP II, p43, or α-ATP synthase did not bind to any other recombinant proteins we tested (data not shown). We further confirmed the interaction of EMAP II or p43 with α-ATP synthase by pull down assays. The α-ATP synthase mixed with either EMAP II or p43 was incubated with anti-α-ATP synthase antibody and precipitated with protein A-Sepharose. The proteins in the precipitates were detected by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining (Fig.5 E), and the presence of α-ATP synthase, EMAP II, and p43 was subsequently confirmed by Western blotting with their specific antibodies (Fig. 5 F). EMAP II or p43 was not precipitated when mock IgG was used (data not shown). We then evaluated whether the antibodies directed against EMAP II and α-ATP synthase can inhibit the binding of EMAP II to α-ATP synthase. The polyclonal antibodies raised against EMAP II completely inhibited the binding of EMAP II to α-ATP synthase (Fig. 5 C). Although a high concentration was required for the inhibition, binding of EMAP II to α-ATP synthase was blocked by the polyclonal antibodies containing anti-α-ATP synthase antibody (Fig. 5 D). High concentrations required for the inhibition may be due to a low proportion of anti-α-ATP synthase antibody in the polyclonal antibodies because the antibodies were purified using a protein A-Sepharose column. These data also support that EMAP II bound to α-ATP synthase in a specific manner. To provide further evidence that α-ATP synthase is responsible for the cell surface binding of EMAP II, we analyzed the binding of EMAP II to the starved cells in the presence of soluble α-ATP synthase or polyclonal antibodies containing anti-α-ATP synthase antibody by flow cytometry and confocal microscopy. Soluble α-ATP synthase blocked binding of EMAP II to the starved CEM cells significantly (Fig. 4,B and D), whereas polyclonal antibodies containing anti-α-ATP synthase antibody inhibit slightly (data not shown). In contrast, an unrelated control protein or control antibody showed no inhibition. Similar results were obtained when binding of p43 to the starved CEM in the presence of soluble α-ATP synthase was analyzed by flow cytometry (Fig. 4 C), implying the possibility that EMAP II and p43 share the binding molecule. Previous studies showed that EMAP II inhibits EC proliferation and induces EC apoptosis (15Berger A.C. Alexander H.R. Wu P.C. Tang G. Gnant M.F. Mixon A. Turner E.S. Libutti S.K. Cytokine. 2000; 12: 992-1000Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) and that α and β subunits of ATP synthase colocalize on the surface of HUVECs (23Moser T.L. Kenan D.J. Ashley T.A. Roy J.A. Goodman M.D. Misra U.K. Cheek D.J. Pizzo S.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6656-6661Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). We investigated whether EMAP II also binds to the EC surface and α-ATP synthase is expressed in the EC surface (data not shown). HUVECs and BAECs without serum starvation were stained with either EMAP II or anti-α-ATP synthase antibody when analyzed by confocal microscopy and flow cytometry of the non-permeabilized cells. This result is supported by the fact that human and bovine ATP synthase are highly homologous (98.5%), differing only by eight amino acid residues in the mature α-chain. The staining pattern of α-ATP synthase was similar to the previous report (23Moser T.L. Kenan D.J. Ashley T.A. Roy J.A. Goodman M.D. Misra U.K. Cheek D.J. Pizzo S.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6656-6661Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). To gain insight into the function of EMAP II through α-ATP synthase, we tested whether EMAP II and p43 can inhibit the growth of BAECs. EMAP II and p43 inhibited BAEC proliferation by 40 and 50%, respectively (Table I). In contrast, soluble α-ATP synthase exhibited no effect on proliferation. Furthermore, the polyclonal antibodies containing anti-α-ATP synthase antibody inhibited the BAEC proliferation in a concentration-dependent manner, suggesting that the antibodies directed against α-ATP synthase mimic the antiangiogenic effect of EMAP II in the ECs. An unrelated polyclonal antibody had no effect on inhibition (Table I). Similar results were obtained from the experiments with HUVEC (data not shown).Table IInhibition of BAEC proliferation in the presence of EMAP II, p43, and anti α-ATP synthase antibodyTreatment% inhibition ± S.E.EMAP II (0.25 μm)40.0 ± 4.53p43 (0.25 μm)50.8 ± 3.12α-ATP synthase (0.25 μm)−6.2 ± 1.25Anti-α-ATP synthase antibody (μg/ml)10059.1 ± 7.112544.7 ± 6.786.2519.2 ± 4.15Control antibody (μg/ml)1003.8 ± 1.05257.3 ± 0.956.255.8 ± 0.10BAEC were plated at a density of 10,000 cells/well and incubated with media containing 0.25 μm EMAP II, p43, α-ATP synthase, and 100, 25, and 6.25 μg/ml polyclonal antibodies containing anti-α-ATP synthase antibody.

Open table in a new tab BAEC were plated at a density of 10,000 cells/well and incubated with media containing 0.25 μm EMAP II, p43, α-ATP synthase, and 100, 25, and 6.25 μg/ml polyclonal antibodies containing anti-α-ATP synthase antibody. Cell proliferation was measured by MTS assay according to the manufacturer's instructions. Unrelated polyclonal antibody was used as control. To determine whether the antiproliferative effects of EMAP II were mediated by ATP synthase binding, cell proliferation assays were performed in the presence of soluble α-ATP synthase. The inhibitory effects of EMAP II on BAEC proliferation were abrogated by 30% in the presence of soluble α-ATP synthase at low concentrations (Fig.6). These data showed that the binding of EMAP II or p43 to α-ATP synthase may function as a mechanism for the inhibition of the EC growth. Here we showed that the EMAP II binding was significantly increased in the serum-starved tumor cells (Fig. 1). The EMAP II-binding protein purified from the serum-starved cell membrane was identified as the α subunit of ATP synthase (Figs. 3 and4 A). The interaction of EMAP II with α-ATP synthase was inhibited by their specific antibodies (Fig. 5, C andD) and the soluble recombinant α-ATP synthase (Fig.4 B), suggesting that their interaction is specific. To gain an insight into the function of EMAP II through α-ATP synthase, we investigated whether α-ATP synthase is involved in the inhibition of the EC proliferation by EMAP II. We first confirmed that α-ATP synthase was expressed on the surface of ECs (data not shown) and EMAP II inhibited the EC proliferation (Table I) as previously described (16Berger A.C. Alexander H.R.

Furthermore, the inhibitory effect of EMAP II on the EC proliferation was blocked by the soluble α-ATP synthase (Fig. 6). Interestingly, α-ATP synthase polyclonal antibody inhibited the EC proliferation, mimicking the effect of EMAP II (Table I). Collectively, these results suggest that the interaction of EMAP II with α-ATP synthase may inhibit the proliferation of ECs. We found that the expression of the EMAP II binding molecule, α-ATP synthase, is increased on the surface of the serum-starved cells and that the α-ATP synthase on the serum-starved cells specifically interacted with EMAP II (Fig. 4). However, we do not know the physiological meaning for the increase of the surface interaction between EMAP II and α-ATP synthase on serum-starved conditions. In this report, we propose that the function of EMAP II on ECs might be exerted through α-ATP synthase on the surface of ECs (Fig. 6). The possible molecular mechanism of the EMAP II function through ATP synthase on the EC can be similar to that of angiostatin. In the previous studies, ATP synthase was already identified as the binding target of angiostatin that is an anti-angiogenic factor (21Moser T.L. Stack M.S. Asplin I. Enghild J.J. Hφjrup P.

ATP synthase is composed of the F1 portion of multiple subunits (α3β3γδε) that acts as the catalytic site for ATP synthesis and hydrolysis and the F0portion that acts as the proton channel (24Stock D. Gibbons C. Arechaga I. Leslie A. Walker J.E. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2000; 10: 672-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). All of the components forming the core catalytic complex of F1-ATP synthase are present on the external EC surface. F1-F0-ATP synthase constitutes the major EC-binding site for angiostatin, which is active in ATP synthesis and inhibits the EC proliferation by blocking conformational changes of the enzyme complex required for ATP synthesis or hydrolysis (21Moser T.L. Stack M.S. Asplin I. Enghild J.J. Hφjrup P. Everitt L. Hubchak S. Schnaper H.W. Pizzo S.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2811-2816Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar, 23Moser T.L.

Conclusively, angiostatin inhibits vascularization by suppression of ATP metabolism on the EC surface, which, in turn, may regulate vascular physiology. Although our studies showed that EMAP II interacts with α-ATP synthase, a functional test remains to be performed whether EMAP II directly inhibits the activity of ATP synthase and whether EMAP II competes with angiostatin for the binding to ATP synthase. The results of this work suggest that the interaction of EMAP II with α-ATP synthase may function as a mechanism for the inhibition of EC growth and play a regulatory role in the tumor vasculature. Although p43/EMAP II was found to interact with ATP synthase, we do not exclude the possibility that it may have other interacting surface molecules working at other physiological conditions."

PARN belongs to the RNase D family of nucleases, a family characterized by the presence of four conserved acidic amino acid residues. Here, we show by site-directed mutagenesis that these residues of human PARN, i.e.Asp28, Glu30, Asp292, and Asp382, are essential for catalysis but are not required for stabilization of the PARN·RNA substrate complex. We have used iron(II)-induced hydroxyl radical cleavage to map Fe2+binding sites in PARN. Two Fe2+ binding sites were identified, and three of the conserved acidic amino acid residues were important for Fe2+ binding at these sites. Furthermore, we show that the apparent dissociation constant (app K d ) values for Fe2+binding at both sites were affected in PARN polypeptides in which the conserved acidic amino acid residues were substituted to alanine. This suggests that these residues coordinate divalent metal ions. We conclude that the four conserved acidic amino acids are essential residues of the PARN active site and that the active site of PARN functionally and structurally resembles the active site for 3′-exonuclease domain of Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I.

The cap interacting and poly(A) degrading properties of PARN also provide evidence that PARN may play a role in controlling initiation of protein synthesis (3Martinez J. Ren Y.G. Thuresson A.C.

Besides a possible role in controlling translation, the mRNA cap binding property of PARN has a direct role in stimulating PARN degradation efficiency (3Martinez J. Ren Y.G. Thuresson A.C. Hellman U.

In this model, oligomeric PARN interacts simultaneously with the mRNA 3′-end-located poly(A) tail and the 5′-end-located cap structure. It has been suggested, based on kinetic evidence, that the cap-binding site is separate from the active site of PARN (8Martinez J. Ren Y.G. Nilsson P. Ehrenberg M. Virtanen A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27923-27929Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The amino acid sequence of PARN implies that PARN belongs to the RNase D family of nucleases (2Körner C.G. Wormington M. Muckenthaler M. Schneider S. Dehlin E. Wahle E.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 5110-5118Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar), of which the 3′-exonuclease (or proofreading) domain of Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I is one of the best-studied examples (13Joyce C.M. Steitz T.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 777-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar). The presence of four conserved acidic amino acid residues is a hallmark of this class of nucleases, and in the case of the 3′-exonuclease domain ofE. coli DNA polymerase I, these residues are essential for catalytic activity and are involved in coordinating two catalytically important divalent metal ions (14Bernad A. Blanco L. Lazaro J.M. Martin G. Salas M. Cell. 1989; 59: 219-228Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar, 15Brautigam C.A. Steitz T.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 277: 363-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). However, the importance of the conserved acidic amino acid residues in PARN for catalytic activity remains to be established. Here, we have applied site-directed mutagenesis to demonstrate that the four conserved acidic amino acid residues (i.e.Asp28, Glu30, Asp292, and Asp382) of human PARN, comprising the conserved RNase D motif, are essential for catalytic activity. We also show, by mapping Fe2+ binding sites using the iron-induced hydroxyl radical cleavage technique, that amino acid residues Asp28, Glu30, and Asp382 are directly involved in coordinating divalent metal ions. We conclude that the active site of PARN functionally and structurally resembles the active site of the 3′-exonuclease domain of E. coli DNA polymerase I.

All PARN mutants were generated from the pE19PARN plasmid using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) following the manufacturer's protocol. To introduce the D28A, E30A, D292A, and D382A substitutions, we used the following pairs of oligonucleotide primers: P(28A)5 (5′-CGACTTCTTCGCCATCGCAGGGGAGTTTTCAGG-3′) and P(28A)3 (5′-CCTGAAAACTCCCCTGCGATGGCGAAGAAGTCG-3′), P(30A)5 (5′-CGCCATCGATGGGGCGTTTTCAGGAATCAGTG-3′) and P(30A)3 (5′-CACTGATTCCTGAAAACGCCCCATCGATGGCG-3′), P(292A)5 (5′-CACAATATGCTCTTGGCCGTCATGCACACAGTTC-3′) and P(292A)3 (5′-GAACTGTGTGCATGACGGCCAAGAGCATATTGTG-3′), and P(382A)5 (5′-CCACGAGGCAGGCTACGCAGCCTACATCACAGG-3′) and P(382A)3 (5′-CCTGTGATGTAGGCTGCGTAGCCTGCCTCGTGG-3′). Mutations were verified by DNA sequencing. The DNA fragments with the confirmed mutations from plasmids pE19PARN(D28A), pE19PARN(E30A), pE19PARN(D292A), and pE19PARN(D382A) were subsequently subcloned between the NdeI and BlpI sites of pET33 to generate plasmids pE33PARN(D28A), pE33PARN(E30A), pE33PARN(D292A), and pE33PARN(D382A), respectively. His-tagged recombinant wild-type and mutant PARN(D28A), PARN(E30A), PARN(D292A), and PARN(D382A) polypeptides were expressed in E. coli strain BL21 (DE3) containing plasmids pE33PARN, pE33PARN(D28A), pE33PARN(E30A), pE33PARN(D292A), and pE33PARN(D382A), respectively. Soluble recombinant polypeptides were purified by metal affinity chromatography using Ni2+matrix (Novagen Inc.) following the manufacturer's instructions. The amount of protein was measured with a Bio-Rad protein assay kit, and its purity was analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by silver staining. High molecular weight silver staining marker was purchased from Sigma Chemical Co. To detect and quantify poly(A)-specific ribonuclease activity of recombinant wild-type or mutant PARNs, we used the dual assay strategy (3Martinez J. Ren Y.G. Thuresson A.C. Hellman U. Astrom J.

Deadenylation reactions for the gel assay were carried out as described previously (3Martinez J. Ren Y.G. Thuresson A.C. Hellman U. Astrom J. Virtanen A. J. Biol.

Reactions were incubated at 30 °C or 37 °C, as indicated. 100 or 500 fmol of recombinant wild-type or mutant PARN(D28A), PARN(E30A), PARN(D292A), and PARN(D382A) polypeptide was used for each reaction. The resulting products of RNA-body-labeled L3(A30) substrate were purified and investigated by electrophoresis in 10% polyacrylamide (19:1 acrylamide/bisacrylamide)/7 m urea gels (gel assay). The released 5′-AMP product of poly(A)-tail-labeled L3(A30) RNA substrate was detected by one-dimensional TLC analysis (TLC assay). The resulting gels and TLC plates were visualized and quantified using a 400 S PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). The reaction conditions when Mg2+ was replaced by Mn2+ or Fe2+ were unaltered, with the exception of the divalent metal ion included. Deadenylation reactions were performed as described previously (3Martinez J. Ren Y.G. Thuresson A.C. Hellman U. Astrom J. Virtanen A. J. Biol.

To determine binding affinity of recombinant wild-type and mutant PARN polypeptides with the RNA substrate, a homogeneous 50-ribonucleotide-long poly(A) RNA (Sigma Chemical Co.) was titrated into the reaction. After the addition of 5 pmol of recombinant wild-type or mutant PARN(D28A), PARN(E30A), PARN(D292A), and PARN(D382A) polypeptide, the samples were placed on ice for 30 s and then supplemented with 2.7 μl of 5 μg/μl heparin for another 10 min. 6 μl of the sample was immediately applied to native polyacrylamide gels (79:1 acrylamide (3.5%)/bisacrylamide and 0.5% agarose) prerun for at least 30 min at 90–100 V at 4 °C in 55 mm Tris, 90 mm boric acid, and 2 mm EDTA at pH 8. After electrophoresis, the gels were fixed in 10% acetic acid for 10 min, dried, and subsequently subjected to 400 S PhosphorImager analysis. The apparent dissociation constant (app K d ) value was defined as the concentration of poly(A50) at which the PARN·L3(A30) RNA complex was reduced to 50% of the amount of complex formed in the absence of poly(A50). Theapp K d values were based on at least three independent experiments for each PARN polypeptide. Recombinant PARN polypeptides, which contained a protein kinase recognition motif at their N termini, were kinasedin vitro with 32P. For each reaction, 30 μl (about 300 pmol) of purified recombinant wild-type or mutant PARN(D28A), PARN(E30A), PARN(D292A), and PARN(D382A) polypeptide was applied onto a G-50 spin column (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) pre-equilibrated with HMK buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1 m NaCl, and 12 mm MgCl2) and spun for 1 min at 2000 × g. The eluate was mixed with 1 μl of [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol; Amersham Biosciences, Inc.), 1 μl of 50 μm ATP, and 3 μl (10 units/μl) of freshly prepared bovine heart protein kinase catalytic subunit (Sigma Chemical Co.). After 30 min of incubation on ice, the labeling mixture was applied onto a G-50 spin column pre-equilibrated in buffer F (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, and 100 mmNaCl) and spun for 1 min at 2000 × g. The efficiency of labeling was checked by SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography. N-terminally [32P]-labeled recombinant wild-type or mutant PARN(D28A), PARN(E30A), PARN(D292A), and PARN(D382A) polypeptide was incubated in the presence of 60 nm poly(A50) RNA in 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 10 mm DTT, and different concentrations of Fe(NH4)2SO4. The total reaction volume was 10 μl. After 15–30 min of incubation at 37 °C, the reactions were stopped by adding 10 μl of 2× SDS loading buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% (w/v) SDS, 200 mm DTT, 16% (v/v) glycerol, 0.05% (w/v) bromphenol blue, and 50 mm EDTA). The samples were subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE. After SDS-PAGE, the gel was dried, and the resulting polypeptides were visualized and quantified using a 400 S PhosphorImager. The protein reference marker was RainbowTM14C methylated high protein molecular weight markers from Amersham Biosciences, Inc. To denature the protein, 32P-labeled recombinant wild-type PARN was treated at 100 °C for 5 min before the cleavage reaction was performed. In Mg2+ and Mn2+ competition experiments, MgCl2 or MnCl2 was added at different concentrations of 1, 10, and 100 μm together with 2 μmFe(NH4)2SO4. 10 mm EDTA was used to chelate Fe2+. Theapp K d values for each recombinant wild-type and mutant PARN were determined, according to Lineweaver-Burk formalism, from at least three independent experiments. To investigate whether the conserved acidic amino acid residues Asp28, Glu30, Asp292, and Asp382 of human PARN are essential for PARN activity, we substituted each of them with alanine (see “Experimental Procedures”). The wild-type and mutant polypeptides (i.e.PARN, PARN(D28A), PARN(E30A), PARN(D292A), and PARN(D382A)) were expressed in E. coli and purified to homogeneity. PARN activity was assayed by the previously described dual deadenylation assay strategy (3Martinez J. Ren Y.G. Thuresson A.C. Hellman U. Astrom J. Virtanen A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24222-24230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) using RNA-body-labeled and poly(A)-tail-labeled L3(A30) RNA as the substrates. In both assays (Fig.1, A and B), wild-type PARN showed high activity. In contrast to this, all four mutant PARN polypeptides were inactive, and the deadenylated L3 RNA product was not accumulated (Fig. 1 A), nor was 5′-AMP released (Fig. 1 B). We conclude that the conserved acidic amino acids Asp28, Glu30, Asp292, and Asp382 are essential for PARN activity. To investigate whether the drop in deadenylation activity of the mutant polypeptides was caused by reduced RNA binding activity of the PARN alanine substitution mutants, we examined the RNA binding properties of PARN and mutant PARN polypeptides by electrophoretic mobility shift assay. The results showed that all tested PARN polypeptides formed the expected PARN·RNA substrate complex (Fig.2 A). This suggests that the RNA binding properties of the mutant polypeptides were not significantly affected by the alanine substitutions. To quantify the RNA binding strength of each PARN polypeptide, we determined theapp K d values for PARN (Fig.2 B) and for each mutant PARN polypeptide. The calculatedapp K d values are listed in TableI. We conclude that none of the alanine substitutions significantly affected the RNA binding property of PARN, showing that the inability of the mutant polypeptides to degrade poly(A) was not due to reduced RNA binding capacity. Thus, the conserved acidic amino acid residues are not crucial for stabilizing the PARN·RNA substrate complex.Table IBinding constants for the PARN·RNA complexPolypeptideapp K dnmPARN6.5 ± 1.6D28A6.8 ± 2.7E30A6.0 ± 1.8D292A7.6 ± 1.1D382A5.8 ± 1.9The app K d values for the PARN·RNA complexes were determined as described under “Experimental Procedures” and Fig. 2.

It has been established that some Mg2+-dependent exonucleases are active in the presence of Fe2+, probably because Fe2+ is structurally and functionally similar to Mg2+ in both size and coordination geometry (16Brown I.B. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. B. 1988; 44: 545-553Crossref Scopus (239) Google Scholar). We therefore tested whether PARN, an Mg2+- or Mn2+-dependent 3′-exoribonuclease (3Martinez J. Ren Y.G. Thuresson A.C. Hellman U. Astrom J. Virtanen A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24222-24230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), was also active in the presence of Fe2+ and found that to be the case (Fig.3). The optimal Fe2+concentration was ∼10 μm (Fig. 3), similar to the optimal Mn2+ concentration but much lower than the optimal Mg2+ concentration, which is ∼0.75–1 mm(data not shown). Finally, we found that the mutant PARN(D28A), PARN(E30A), PARN(D292A), and PARN(D382A) polypeptides were inactive in the presence of Fe2+ (data not shown). Thus, we conclude that PARN is active in the presence of Fe2+ and that the requirement for the conserved acidic amino acid residues was not released in the presence of Fe2+. In the presence of reductants, such as ascorbic acid or DTT, Fe2+ generates hydroxyl radicals, which very efficiently cleave the polypeptide backbone chain in the vicinity of the Fe2+ binding site. The active sites of several metalloenzymes have successfully been mapped using Fe2+-mediated cleavage in combination with site-directed mutagenesis (for example, see Refs. 17Farber J.M. Levine R.L.

To identify metal ion binding sites in PARN, we subjected N-terminally32P-kinase-labeled PARN to Fe2+-mediated cleavage. The resulting products were resolved by SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography. Fig. 4 shows that two distinct cleaved products of 35 (cleavage site I) and 48 (cleavage site II) kDa in size, respectively, were generated in the presence of Fe2+ and DTT (lanes 4 and 7–13). In the absence of DTT and/or Fe2+ (lanes 1–3) or when Mg2+ replaced Fe2+ (data not shown), the cleavages were abolished. Moreover, the cleavages were inhibited by the addition of EDTA, which chelates Fe2+ (lane 6). Increasing the amount of Mg2+ or Mn2+ reduced the appearance of both Fe2+-mediated cleavage products (Fig. 4, lanes 8–13), suggesting competition between Fe2+ and Mg2+ or Mn2+ binding. The addition of Mn2+ inhibited Fe2+-mediated cleavage much more efficiently than did the addition of Mg2+, in keeping with the determined optimal Mn2+ and Mg2+ concentrations for PARN. To investigate the specificity of the Fe2+-mediated cleavage, we subjected heat-denatured PARN polypeptides to cleavage (Fig. 4,lane 5) and found that the two distinct cleavage bands were no longer evident, suggesting that proper folding of PARN was required for site-specific cleavages. In summary, these data show that PARN was cleaved at two positions in the presence of Fe2+ and DTT and that the Fe2+-mediated cleavage of PARN was site-specific and occurred in the vicinity of Mg2+ or Mn2+binding sites. Fig. 5, A andB, shows that the Fe2+-mediated cleavage reaction could be saturated by the addition of increasing amount of Fe2+. Thus, app K d values for Fe2+ binding at each cleavage site can be determined using Lineweaver-Burk formalism. Table II shows the calculated app K d values for Fe2+ binding to PARN in the presence of 60 nmpoly(A50). The observation that theapp K d values for Fe2+ ions mediating hydroxyl radical cleavages were in the same range as the optimal concentration of Fe2+ ions required for PARN activity (Fig. 3) is in keeping with the conclusion that the catalytically important Fe2+ ions were responsible for the Fe2+-mediated cleavages. We also note that theapp K d values for Fe2+ at cleavage sites I and II differed from each other. This implies that the two cleavage sites were not produced by the same Fe2+ ion, suggesting that PARN has at least two different Fe2+binding sites.Table IIBinding constants for iron binding to PARN polypeptidesPolypeptideapp K dCleavage I2-aCleavage I and Cleavage II refer to Fe2+-induced cleavage at cleavage sites I and II, as specified in Fig. 4.Cleavage II2-aCleavage I and Cleavage II refer to Fe2+-induced cleavage at cleavage sites I and II, as specified in Fig. 4.nmPARN2.1 ± 0.11.1 ± 0.1D28A>20>20E30A2.0 ± 0.22.0 ± 0.2D292A2.2 ± 0.21.0 ± 0.1D382A2.1 ± 0.13.8 ± 0.3The app K d values for Fe2+ binding to PARN and mutants thereof were determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The given values are average ± experimental error of several independent experiments.2-a Cleavage I and Cleavage II refer to Fe2+-induced cleavage at cleavage sites I and II, as specified in Fig. 4. Open table in a new tab The app K d values for Fe2+ binding to PARN and mutants thereof were determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The given values are average ± experimental error of several independent experiments. Next we determined the app K d values for Fe2+ binding to mutant PARN polypeptides. We were not able to determine an app K d value for the PARN(D28A) polypeptide, suggesting that the alanine substitution at position Asp28 had a dramatic effect on Fe2+binding (Fig. 6 and Table II). Alanine substitutions at Glu30 and Asp382 enhanced theapp K d values for cleavage site II from 1.1 to 2.0 or 3.8 μm, respectively, and did not affect the app K d values at cleavage site I (Table II). In contrast, alanine substitution at Asp292showed minor or no effects on the app K d values at cleavage sites I and II (Fig. 6 and Table II). From these data (Fig. 6 and Table II), we conclude that at least three acidic amino acid residues, i.e. Asp28, Glu30, and Asp382, are directly involved in the coordination of Fe2+ ions. Our analyses also suggested that Asp28 was the most critical residue for Fe2+coordination. In this study, we have used site-directed mutagenesis and Fe2+-mediated cleavage to identify amino acids essential for PARN activity and coordination of divalent metal ions. Our data show that three conserved aspartic acid residues at positions 28, 292, and 382 and one glutamic acid residue at position 30 of human PARN are essential for PARN activity (Fig. 1). Three of those residues, Asp28, Glu30, and Asp382, were also found to be important for the coordination of divalent metal ions (Figs. 5 and 6 and Table II). Furthermore, we found that none of these acidic amino acid residues was vital for PARN binding to the RNA substrate (Fig. 2 and Table I). Based on our data, we suggest that amino acids Asp28, Glu30, Asp292, and Asp382 are fundamental residues of the PARN active site. Iron-induced hydroxyl radical cleavage has previously been used successfully to identify amino acids involved in coordinating divalent ions in several enzymes as exemplified by the metal ion binding sites in E. coli glutamine synthetase (17Farber J.M.

Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 3097-3105Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The identification of the metal ion binding sites in these enzymes has been an important step in understanding their active sites and mechanisms of catalysis. The fact that Fe2+ could replace Mg2+ in PARN deadenylation reactions (Fig. 3) validates our use of the Fe2+-mediated protein footprinting technique. Comparison of the Fe2+-mediated cleavage with native and denatured protein (Fig. 4) clarified that the cleavage was specific to the three-dimensional structure of the protein, as reported previously for staphylococcal nuclease (18Ermacora M.R. Delfino J.M. Cuenoud B. Schepartz A. Fox R.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6383-6387Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). In studying the organization of the catalytic center of E. coli RNA polymerase, Mustaev et al. (20Mustaev A. Kozlov M. Markovtsov V. Zaychikov E. Denissova L. Goldfarb A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6641-6645Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) found that one Fe2+ ion could create several distinct cleavages on the same polypeptide subunit because theapp K d values for the critical Fe2+ ions were identical for the cleavage sites. In the case of PARN, we found that the app K d values for Fe2+ at the two sites differed (Table II), suggesting that at least two Fe2+ ions were involved in the Fe2+-mediated cleavage. This conclusion was further supported by the observation that alanine substitutions at sites 30 and 382 only affected the app K d value of cleavage site II and did so by increasing theapp K d value approximately 2- and 4-fold, respectively (Table II). PARN belongs to the RNase D family of nucleases (2Körner C.G. Wormington M. Muckenthaler M. Schneider S. Dehlin E. Wahle E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5427-5437Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). In this family, which includes the 3′-5′-exonuclease domain of E. coli DNA polymerase I (reviewed in Refs. 13Joyce C.M. Steitz T.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 777-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar and 32Joyce C.M. Steitz T.A. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 6321-6329Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), four acidic amino acid residues are conserved and located in three separate sequence motifs called ExoI, ExoII, and ExoIII (14Bernad A. Blanco L. Lazaro J.M. Martin G. Salas M. Cell. 1989; 59: 219-228Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). The studies of the 3′-5′-exonuclease domain of E. coli DNA polymerase I (33Brautigam C.A. Steitz T.A. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1998; 8: 54-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar) have revealed that these acidic amino acid residues are involved in the coordination of two magnesium ions, which are essential for catalysis. Amino acids Asp355, Glu357, and Asp501 are directly involved in coordinating metal ions, whereas residue Asp424 coordinates the metal ion indirectly through bridging water (15Brautigam C.A. Steitz T.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 277: 363-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Our results are very much compatible with a similar model for the active site of PARN (Fig.7). In this model, Asp28coordinates two divalent metal ions, whereas each of the residues Asp28, Glu30, and Asp382 only coordinates one of the two divalent metal ions. The fact that the alanine substitution at Asp292 did not affect theapp K d value for Fe2+ binding at both cleavage sites could be because Asp292, in analogy with Asp424 of E. coli DNA polymerase I, coordinates one divalent metal ion indirectly through bridging water. Based on our model for the active site of PARN, we propose that PARN, as the 3′-5′-exonuclease domain of E. coli DNA polymerase I (15Brautigam C.A. Steitz T.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 277: 363-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), carries out hydrolysis of phosphodiester bounds by using the two-metal ion mechanism for catalysis (10Steitz T.A. Steitz J.A.

In particular, the cell type(s) with which OPN interacts to stimulate tumor growth is not known. One well described function of OPN in vitro is as a cell adhesion molecule when it is coated onto a plastic surface (9Chambers A.F. Hota C. Prince C.W. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 701-706PubMed Google Scholar, 10Senger D.R. Perruzzi C.A. Papadopoulous-Sergiou A. Van De Water L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 565-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). The protein contains an RGD sequence that can mediate cell adhesion (11Bautista D.S. Xuan J.W. Hota C. Chambers A.F. Harris J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23280-23285Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), although other non-RGD sequences in the molecule can also mediate adhesion: these include the SVVYGLR sequence in human OPN (12Yokosaki Y. Matsuura N. Sasaki T. Murakami I. Schneider H. Higashiyama S. Saitoh Y. Yamakido M. Taooka Y. Sheppard D. J. Biol.

Adhesion of cells to OPN is in most cases through a variety of integrins (reviewed in Ref. 18Denhardt D.T. Noda M. J. Cell.

Science. 1996; 271: 509-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (820) Google Scholar). Most notably, OPN is a well characterized ligand for the αvβ3 integrin, which is important for angiogenesis and endothelial cell survival (21Brooks P.C. Montgomery A.M. Rosenfeld M. Reisfeld R.A. Hu T. Klier G. Cheresh D.A. Cell. 1994; 79: 1157-1164Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2185) Google Scholar, 22Eliceiri B.P. Cheresh D.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 1227-1230Crossref PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar). Thus, one possibility for the function of OPN in tumorigenesis is to promote survival of endothelial cells: indeed the protein has been demonstrated to have this function in vitro, as an insoluble adhesive ligand (23Scatena M. Almeida M. Chaisson M.L. Fausto N. Nicosia R.F. Giachelli C.M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1083-1093Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). Like endothelial cells, osteoclasts express high levels of the αvβ3 integrin: this integrin is critical for osteoclast function (24McHugh K.P. Hodivala-Dilke K. Zheng M.H. Namba N. Lam J. Novack D. Feng X. Ross F.P. Hynes R.O. Teitelbaum S.L. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 433-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar). OPN is present at high levels in bone (25McKee M.D. Nanci A. Microsc. Res. Tech. 1996; 33: 141-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar, 26Prince C.W. Oosawa T. Butler W.T. Tomana M. Bhown A.S. Bhown M. Schrohenloher R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 2900-2907Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and is an important ligand for the osteoclast αvβ3 integrin as evidenced by reduced bone resorption in osteopontin-deficient mice (2Yoshitake H. Rittling S.R. Denhardt D.T. Noda M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8156-8160Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). Thus, in bone, OPN is a well established component of the extracellular matrix, and can function in vivo in this tissue as a cell attachment molecule. However, osteopontin has a high affinity for hydroxyapatite by virtue of its general acidic nature, its high degree of phosphorylation, as well as due to a run of 9–10 aspartates in the NH2-terminal half of the molecule (27Reinholt F.P. Hultenby K. Oldberg A. Heinegard D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4473-4475Crossref PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar). Thus, its accumulation in bone may be due to its affinity for the mineral, rather than the protein component of bone tissue. It is still not clear, therefore, if OPN functions as a cell attachment molecule in soft tissues. While numerous cell types have been demonstrated to adhere to OPN coated onto a plastic surface, including endothelial cells, fibroblasts, transformed cells, and smooth muscle cells (10Senger D.R. Perruzzi C.A. Papadopoulous-Sergiou A. Van De Water L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 565-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 11Bautista D.S. Xuan J.W. Hota C. Chambers A.F. Harris J.F. J.

Chem. 2000; 275: 24565-24574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), this activity is only physiologically relevant if these cell types encounter immobilized OPN in vivo. An important question to be addressed therefore is whether OPN is associated with the extracellular matrix in non-calcified matrices. Of special interest is the situation in tumors: if OPN, which is expressed at quite high levels in many tumor types, is functioning as a cell adhesion molecule it should be immobilized in the matrix. In the work presented here, we have used a variety of techniques to localize OPN in tumor tissues and cells, and conclude that OPN made by tumors is primarily, if not exclusively, soluble. Laminin (Sigma), fibronectin (Invitrogen), collagen I and matrigel (Collaborative Research/BD) were obtained from commercial sources, while recombinant GST-OPN was isolated as described (31Xuan J.W. Hota C. Chambers A.F. J. Cell. Biochem. 1994; 54: 247-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). mOPN was isolated from ras-transformed 3T3 cell conditioned medium by using DEAE-Sepharose chromatography. Antibodies to laminin and fibronectin were obtained from Sigma. Antibodies to OPN were: goat anti-rat OPN antibody OP199 (28Liaw L. Almeida M. Hart C.E. Schwartz S.M. Giachelli C.M. Circ. Res. 1994; 74: 214-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar) or rabbit anti-human OPN antibody LF 123 (32Fisher L.W. Stubbs J.T.I. Young M.F. Acta Orthop. Scand. 1995; 66: 61-65Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar): both these antibodies were used at a dilution of 1:1000; they both react with mouse OPN and were used interchangeably. LF123 has a slightly higher affinity for mouse OPN, but cross-reacts nonspecifically with a few other bands in tumor and cell lysates: the specificity of these antibodies has been described in detail elsewhere (33Rittling S.R. Feng F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 250: 287-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). For immunohistochemistry, pooled, affinity purified mouse anti-mouse OPN 2A. J. Kowalski, S. R. Rittling, and D. T. Denhardt, unpublished data. was used. For immunofluorescence, monoclonal anti-mouse 2A12 was used; this antibody reacts with an epitope in the C-terminal half of OPN. These antibodies were raised in the OPN −/− mice. The tumors used here were derived from two different experimental systems. Mammary tumors arising spontaneously in MMTV-c-myc/MMTV-v-Ha-rastransgenic mice, either wild type or OPN-deficient (34Feng F. Rittling S.R. Breast Cancer Res. Treat. 2000; 63: 71-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), were used for analysis of extracellular matrix. For the analysis of OPN accumulation in sera and tumors in hosts of different genotypes, tumors were induced by injection of ras-transformed 3T3 cells as described (8Wu Y.M. Denhardt D.T. Rittling S.R. Br. J. Cancer. 2000; 83: 156-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) into either wild type or OPN-deficient mice. In all cases, mice were sacrificed by exsangination, and tumors were removed and immediately flash frozen on liquid nitrogen. Powdered frozen tissue was stored at −70 °C until use. Tumor extracts were made by resuspending the powdered tissue in RIPA buffer containing 0.1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mg/ml aprotinin, and subjecting the extract to 3 cycles of freeze/thaw. For preparation of extracellular matrix from mammary tumors, 50 mg of powdered tissue were resuspended in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, with 0.2% Triton X-100 containing protease inhibitors as above (Tris/Triton), and sonicated. The suspension was centrifuged (15,000 × g; 5 min) and the supernatant retained. The pellet was resuspended in Tris/Triton, and subjected to two more cycles of sonication and centrifugation. The final pellet was resuspended in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 6 m urea. OPN in serum was collected by addition of 1/10 volume each of 15% barium chloride and 3.8% sodium citrate on ice. The resulting precipitate was collected, and washed at 0 °C sequentially with 0.5 volume of 15% barium chloride and H2O. Proteins were eluted by boiling the washed pellets in 20 μl of SDS loading buffer containing 0.2m sodium citrate. Western blotting was performed as described (33Rittling S.R. Feng F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 250: 287-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). ras-transformed wild type and OPN-deficient 3T3 cell lines (8Wu Y.M. Denhardt D.T. Rittling S.R. Br. J. Cancer. 2000; 83: 156-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) were plated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 3% fetal bovine serum on 35-mm wells previously coated with 0.3 mg/ml collagen I in 20 mm acetic acid or with 0.7 mg/ml matrigel (Collaborative Research). The cells were allowed to become confluent and the extracellular matrix and soluble fractions obtained using a modification of the procedure of Gospodarowicz and co-workers (35Globus R.K. Plouet J. Gospodarowicz D. Endocrinology. 1989; 124: 1539-1547Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were washed and lysed in 10 mmTris, pH 7.5, 0.5% Triton X-100, 10 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and the supernatant retained. The wells were then washed with 20 mm NH4OH in 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5. Material remaining in the well was scraped into 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, containing 2% SDS. Control wells (whole cell extracts) were solubilized directly in 2% SDS. Alternatively, the cells were removed with 3 mm EDTA in PBS, after which the matrix was washed and solubilized as above. These methods are commonly used for the preparation of extracellular matrix (36Burgess J.W. Gould D.R. Marcel Y.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5645-5654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 37Owensby D.A. Morton P.A. Schwartz A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 18180-18187Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). An alternative method, removal of cells by incubation with cytochalasin B, was not effective for these transformed cells (data not shown). For OPN and fibronectin, 1/5 of the cell or ECM extracts were separated by PAGE; for laminin, 1/60 of the extracts were used. Equal proportions rather than equal amounts of protein were used because the cell lysate contains proportionately much more protein than the ECM. Wells of 96-well plates were coated with matrix components at 200 μg/well in PBS overnight at 4 °C. These wells were blocked the next day with 2% BSA. Conditioned medium from either wild type or OPN-deficient ras-transformed cells was then added to the coated well and incubated at room temperature for 2 h. The same conditioned medium, and dilutions as indicated were applied directly to uncoated wells. All wells were then washed with water, and the matrix containing wells, and some of the wells containing directly coated conditioned medium were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min at room temperature. Following additional washes, OPN was detected with affinity purified polyclonal antimouse OPN2 at 1:3000 dilution, followed by horseradish peroxidase-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG (Bio-Rad) at a 1:1000 dilution. After washing the horseradish peroxidase substrate, ABTS (0.3 mg/ml in 55 mm citrate, pH 4.0, with .03% H2O2) was added and incubated for 10–30 min in the dark. Serial sections frommyc/ras mammary tumors (38Pattengale P.K. Stewart T.A. Leder A. Sinn E. Tepler I. Schmidt E. Leder P. Am. J. Pathol. 1989; 135: 39-61PubMed Google Scholar) (fixed in methacarn and embedded in paraffin) were rehydrated and endogenous peroxidases blocked in 3% H2O2 in methanol. Tumors arising in both wild type and OPN −/− mice were used (34Feng F. Rittling S.R. Breast Cancer Res. Treat. 2000; 63: 71-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Sections were blocked with goat serum (1:20 in PBS) for 30 min. Primary antibodies were diluted in 1% BSA, 1% goat serum, and incubated with tissue sections for 1 h or overnight. Affinity purified polyclonal anti-mouse OPN (1:1000) was biotinylated with the DAKO ARK system before application to the tissue. Rabbit anti-laminin was from Sigma, was used at 1:300 and detected with biotinylated goat anti-rabbit IgG. All sections were reacted with the ABC reagent (Vector ABC Elite) prior to visualization of the antibody reactivity by staining with diaminobenzidine (Sigma Fast DAB). Sections were lightly counterstained with hematoxylin and mounted in permount. Control sections were incubated without primary antibody. Paraformaldehyde sections frommyc/ras mammary tumors (38Pattengale P.K. Stewart T.A. Leder A. Sinn E. Tepler I. Schmidt E. Leder P. Am. J. Pathol. 1989; 135: 39-61PubMed Google Scholar) were rehydrated and subjected to antigen retrieval (0.01 m citrate, pH 6.0, 100 °C, 10 min). Sections were blocked with goat serum (1:20 in PBS) for 1–2 h. Primary antibodies were diluted in 1% BSA, 1% goat serum, and incubated with tissue sections overnight. Affinity purified monoclonal antibody 2A1 at 0.18 μg/ml was biotinylated with the DAKO ARK system before application to the tissue, and was detected with rhodamine-avidin D (Vector Labs, 16 μg/ml). Anti-laminin was detected with fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson). Rhodamine and fluorescein isothiocyanate signals were collected and a single optical section is shown. Controls with no primary antibody showed fluorescence that was indistinguishable from untreated tissue (data not shown). Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs; Clonetics from pooled donors) were cultured in M199 with 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone), 4 ng/ml aFGF, 75 μg/ml endothelial cell growth supplement (Sigma), and 5 units/ml heparin, and used before PDL 15. Prior to experiments, confluent cells were incubated overnight in M199 with 1 × ITS supplement (Invitrogen), in the absence of serum and growth factors. Quiescent cells were detached with trypsin, washed with M199, and plated at 5 × 104cells/well in M199 containing 1 × ITS and 2% BSA in 48-well plates coated with different substrates. Wells were coated as described below. For apoptosis, cells were incubated overnight in the absence of growth factors, and then labeled for 15 min with 8 μg/ml Hoescht 33342. Floating and adherent cells were collected, fixed, and counted under fluorescence illumination. For [3H]thymidine incorporation, cells were incubated overnight with growth factors (10 ng/ml FGF plus 5 units/ml heparin), then 2 μCi/ml [3H]thymidine were added and the cells were incubated for an additional 5–6 h. Cells were washed, fixed in 7% trichloroacetic acid, then solubilized in 0.5 n NaOH, 0.5% SDS and counted. Control experiments showed that this protocol recovered all the trichloroacetic acid-precipitable counts in the wells. For adhesion assays, exponentially growing cells in complete medium were harvested with trypsin, resuspended in complete medium, and washed in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. Cells were resuspended in 2% BSA, and plated in 96-well plates (Immulon II) at 2 × 104 cells/well. The wells had been previously coated with different substrates as indicated. After 2 h, the wells were washed and the cells stained with crystal violet. Following elution of the dye with acetic acid, absorbance of the wells at 630 nm was determined. Substrates were diluted in PBS and coated on the wells overnight at 4 °C; the wells were subsequently blocked with 2% BSA for 30 min at 37 °C. Substrates used were mOPN (OPN purified fromras-transformed 3T3 cells), GST-OPN (recombinant mouse OPN as a GST fusion protein), fibronectin (Invitrogen), laminin (Sigma), and recombinant GST protein. Unless otherwise indicated, proteins were used at 10 μg/ml. ras-transformed 3T3 lines were generated from both wild type and OPN-deficient mice: these cell lines have been previously described (8Wu Y.M. Denhardt D.T. Rittling S.R. Br. J. Cancer. 2000; 83: 156-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), and shown to give rise to tumors following subcutaneous injection into syngeneic wild type hosts. These tumors form much more slowly when the injected cells are deficient for OPN production, illustrating the important role that OPN plays in the process of tumorigenesis (8Wu Y.M. Denhardt D.T. Rittling S.R. Br. J. Cancer. 2000; 83: 156-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). In other experiments (data not shown), these same cell lines were injected into control (wild type) and OPN-deficient host mice, and tumors allowed to develop. When the tumors reached a volume of 2000–3000 mm3, serum was prepared from the tumor-bearing animals and the tumors were excised. OPN levels in these sera and in tumor extracts were analyzed by Western blotting as shown in Fig. 1. When wild type, OPN-expressing tumors developed in wild type or in OPN-deficient hosts (Fig. 1 A, lanes 2–4 and9–11), OPN protein accumulated to significant levels in the serum. This is consistent with the high level of expression of OPN in the wild type cell lines. Interestingly, in wild type animals bearing OPN-deficient tumors, serum levels of OPN were again elevated over control (non-tumor bearing, wild type mice) levels (Fig. 1 A,lanes 5–7). OPN was not detected in the serum of OPN-deficient mice bearing OPN-deficient tumors (data not shown). Extracts of OPN-expressing tumors similarly contained OPN, as shown previously for OPN-expressing tumors developed in wild type hosts (3Rittling S.R. Novick K.W. Cell Growth Differ. 1997; 8: 1061-1069PubMed Google Scholar,34Feng F. Rittling S.R. Breast Cancer Res. Treat. 2000; 63: 71-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), and the amount of protein was similar whether or not the host animal expressed OPN (Fig. 1 B, lanes 1–2 and 5–6). OPN-deficient tumors developed in wild type mice expressed easily detectable OPN, and in some cases the level of OPN in these tumors was as high as that in wild type tumors (Fig. 1 B,lanes 3 and 4). Again, no OPN was detected when extracts from OPN-deficient tumors developed in OPN-deficient hosts were analyzed (Fig. 1 B, lane 7). We conclude from these results that much of the OPN made by tumors is secreted into the circulation, and that sufficient OPN is produced by the host cells in response to tumor growth to result in substantial levels of the protein in the tumor itself (as detected by Western blotting), and also in elevated serum levels. Biochemical fractionation of tumor extracts was performed to determine whether the OPN present in tumors was associated with the ECM. Tumors arising spontaneously in transgenic mice expressing myc and v-Ha-ras specifically in the mammary gland (34Feng F. Rittling S.R. Breast Cancer Res. Treat. 2000; 63: 71-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 38Pattengale P.K. Stewart T.A. Leder A. Sinn E. Tepler I. Schmidt E. Leder P. Am. J. Pathol. 1989; 135: 39-61PubMed Google Scholar) were flash-frozen and resuspended in Triton X-100 containing buffer, sonicated to disrupt the cell structure, and insoluble material collected by centrifugation. Following three cycles of resuspension and sonication in the same buffer, equal amounts of protein from the first supernatant and the final pellet were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting (Fig. 2). The extracellular matrix proteins fibronectin and laminin were retained in the pellet fraction, confirming that these pellets indeed contained the extracellular matrix material. OPN, on the other hand, was localized exclusively in the soluble fraction: no OPN immunoreactivity could be detected in the pellet, at least in the amount of protein loaded in the well of the PAGE gel (30 μg). Cross-reacting proteins identified in both the soluble and pellet fractions are present in both WT and OPN −/− tumors, indicating that they are not OPN. Laminin and fibronectin reactivity appear also in the soluble fraction: this reactivity may be due to soluble protein present in the tumor, or to partial solubilization of the ECM by the Triton/sonication protocol used. Even if the latter is the case, there is a clear differentiation between the pattern of association of OPN and the former proteins with the insoluble pellet. The localization of osteopontin in tumor tissue was further examined in these spontaneously arising tumors by immunohistochemistry. For these experiments we chose to use the spontaneously arising tumors rather than those resulting from subcutaneous injection of transformed cells, reasoning that the spontaneous tumors would have a more extensive and well developed extracellular matrix. Accumulation of OPN was variable in these tumors, with areas of high expression and regions where OPN was undetectable (Fig. 3: panel B, OPN +/+). Some tumor samples expressed very low levels of OPN (data not shown). In regions where OPN expression was high, however, immunoreactivity appeared over tumor cell cytoplasm. The extracellular matrix in these tumors was identified by staining of adjacent sections for laminin, which was associated particularly with connective tissues and with the basement membrane of blood vessels (Fig. 3: panels A and D, LAM), with some reactivity appearing associated with the tumor cells themselves.

Thus, the diversity of K protein-dependent cellular and viral processes could be attributed to the diversity of its molecular interactions. K protein interacts with a large repertoire of mRNAs (3Ostrowski J. Schullery D.S. Denisenko O.N. Higaki Y. Watts J. Aebersold R. Stempka L. Gschwendt M. Bomsztyk K. J. Biol.

K protein also contains several different protein-protein interaction domains that are responsible for the recruitment of factors involved in signal transduction and gene expression (20Bomsztyk K.

To define the spectrum of genes whose expression is K protein-dependent, we used the yeast three-hybrid screen (25Sengupta D.J. Wickens M. Fields S. RNA. 1999; 5: 596-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) to identify RNA sequences that bind K protein in vivo. Computer-based analysis of the strongest K protein-binding RNA clones defined a consensus sequence composed of three C-rich patches. A number of RNAs isolated in the screen were encoded by mitochondrial genes. K protein co-immunoprecipitated several transcripts from lysates of purified mitochondria, providing evidence for intramitochondrial K protein-RNA interactions. The yeast three-hybrid system pOAA and pIIIMS2-2 plasmids and Saccharomyces cerevisiae L40 strain were a gift from Dr. Stanley Fields (Department of Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, WA) (25Sengupta D.J. Wickens M. Fields S. RNA. 1999; 5: 596-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). To construct human hybrid RNA libraries, total cellular RNA was isolated from human gastric carcinoma AGS cells using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's protocol. Random hexamer-primed cDNAs were synthesized using the cDNA synthesis system (Invitrogen). Double-stranded cDNA was digested with AluI, HaeIII, PvuII, andSspI and then fractionated on 2% agarose gel. Fragments ranging from 50 to 150 bp were purified from the gel and ligated toSmaI-digested and dephosphorylated pIIIMS2-2 plasmid. To construct a mouse mtRNA library, mitochondria isolated from mouse livers were used to purify mtDNA. mtDNA was cut with AluI,HaeIII, and SspI, and 50–150-bp fragments were purified and ligated into SmaI-digested and dephosphorylated pIIIMS2-2 plasmid. The ligation mixture was used to transform competent DH5α cells. The K protein-activation domain hybrid was constructed by insertion of the full-length K protein cDNA (18Ostrowski J. Van Seuningen I. Seger R. Rouch C.T. Sleath P.R. McMullen B.A. Bomsztyk K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17626-17634Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) into the pOAA plasmid. Yeast L40 cells were transformed with the K protein hybrid and the library plasmids using the LiAc/polyethylene glycol method (26Gietz D., St. Jean A. Woods R.A. Schiestl R.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (2893) Google Scholar). Cells were grown on synthetic medium lacking leucine, histidine, uracil, tryptophan, and adenine. Colonies were picked after 4–5 days and plated onto fresh selective plates containing 2.5 mm 3-aminotriazole; and when the cells had grown, β-galactosidase activity was tested by X-gal filter assay. To eliminate false positives, the K protein hybrid plasmid was purged from the colonies by growing cells in liquid medium without uracil but containing 2× concentration of adenine and leucine. Cells without the K protein-activation domain construct were then tested for β-galactosidase activity. The true positive plasmids were isolated from yeast cells, and DNA inserts were sequenced. To test the K protein-binding affinity of the isolated RNA clones, hybrid RNA-expressing plasmids were re-transformed into L40 cells containing the pOAA-K protein plasmid, and the transformants were tested again by X-gal filter assay. Selected yeast clones were then grown in liquid culture until mid-log phase (A 600 = 0.5–0.6). Cells were lysed, and direct quantitative measurements of β-galactosidase activity assays were carried out as previously described (9Shnyreva M. Schullery D.S. Suzuki H. Higaki Y. Bomsztyk K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15498-15503Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Enzymatic assays represent the average of at least three independent colonies for each hybrid RNA-expressing plasmid. The sequences of all RNA fragments were identified using blastn. 3www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST. Similarity searches were conducted in the nr data base (non-redundant data base of sequences deposited in the DDBJ/GenBankTM/EMI Data Bank and the Protein Data Bank) and in the dbEST data base (expressed sequence tags in the DDBJ/GenBankTM/EBI Data Bank) to identify the RNA. RNA secondary structures were predicted using the mfold Version 3.1 server (27Zuker M. Mathews D.H. Turner D.H. Barciszewski J. Clark B.F.C. RNA Biochemistry and Biotechnology. NATO ASI Series, Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, NL1999: 11-43Crossref Google Scholar). 4bioinfo.math.rpi.edu/-fold/rna. The ClustalW program (28Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (55709) Google Scholar) was used for multiple alignment of the RNA fragments. Graphs were generated using Excel programs (Microsoft). Statistical analysis was conducted using Statistica PL. Anesthetized mice were killed; and the livers were resected, cut into small pieces with scissors, and homogenized in a Potter-Elvehjem (Teflon-glass) homogenizer with 10 volumes of cold homogenization buffer (225 mm mannitol, 75 mm sucrose, 0.5 mm EGTA, 10 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.4), 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.5 mmdithiothreitol, and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The homogenate was centrifuged at 650 × g for 10 min, and the supernatant containing the post-nuclear fraction was centrifuged again at 650 × g for 10 min. The post-nuclear supernatant was centrifuged at 11,000 × gfor 10 min in a swing-out rotor. The mitochondrial pellet was resuspended carefully in homogenization buffer and centrifuged again at 11,000 × g for 10 min. The crude mitochondrial fraction suspended in an isotonic sucrose buffer (0.25 msucrose, 1 mm EGTA, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin) was layered on a 1.0/1.5 m discontinuous sucrose gradient and then centrifuged at 80,000 × g for 1 h. Mitochondria were collected from the phase between 1.5 and 1.0 m sucrose and washed several times with the isotonic sucrose buffer. Mouse mitochondria were subfractionated as previously described (29Kang D. Nishida J. Iyama A. Nakabeppu Y. Furuichi M. Fujiwara T. Sekiguchi M. Takeshige K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14659-14665Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Briefly, mitochondria suspended in an isotonic sucrose buffer (0.25 m sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin) were sonicated and then centrifuged at 320,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. The soluble mitochondrial fraction was recovered from the supernatant. The mitochondrial membrane fraction was obtained by homogenization of the pellet in immunoprecipitation buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 5 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40). To obtain mitoplasts (29Kang D. Nishida J. Iyama A. Nakabeppu Y. Furuichi M. Fujiwara T. Sekiguchi M. Takeshige K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14659-14665Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), freshly prepared mitochondria were diluted 10-fold with hypotonic buffer (5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) and 1 mm EDTA) and centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The pellet was washed four times with hypotonic buffer, and proteins from mitoplasts were extracted using immunoprecipitation buffer. The protein concentration was measured using the protein assay (Pierce), and K protein content in mitochondrial protein fractions was analyzed by Western blotting. Equal amounts of sample protein (100 μg) were boiled in 2× loading buffer (125 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 4% SDS, 20% glycerol, and 10% β-mercaptoethanol) for 5 min. Proteins were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and electroblotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween 20 for 1 h at room temperature. The membranes were then probed for 1 h at room temperature with rabbit anti-K protein antibodies. After washing, the membranes were incubated for 60 min at room temperature with secondary antibodies conjugated with alkaline phosphatase, and immunoreactions were detected using 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate/nitro blue tetrazolium phosphatase substrate. Total cellular RNA was prepared as previously described (17Ostrowski J. Kawata Y. Schullery D. Denisenko O.N. Higaki Y. Abrass C.K. Bomsztyk K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9044-9049Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Total mtRNA was prepared from mitochondria that were isolated from livers of anesthetized mice using TRIzol reagent following the manufacturer's protocol. RNase inhibitor (0.1 unit/μl) was used in all procedures involving RNA. Frozen hepatic tissue or isolated mitochondria were pulverized under liquid nitrogen, and the powders were homogenized using immunoprecipitation buffer. In addition to dithiothreitol (0.5 mm), phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (0.5 mm), and leupeptin (10 μg/ml), the lysis buffer contained the following phosphatase inhibitors: 30 mm p-nitrophenyl phosphate, 10 mm sodium fluoride, 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 0.1 mmsodium molybdate, and 10 mm β-glycerophosphate. To co-immunoprecipitate RNA with K protein, we used a previously described procedure (17Ostrowski J. Kawata Y. Schullery D. Denisenko O.N. Higaki Y. Abrass C.K. Bomsztyk K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9044-9049Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Briefly, hepatic or mitochondrial lysates were first precleared with 50 μg of rabbit IgG (Bio-Rad) by bath-sonicating for 15 min at 4 °C, followed by binding to 20 μl of protein A beads for 45 min at 4 °C. Beads were spun down, and the supernatant was bath-sonicated with 20 μl of affinity-purified anti-K protein antibody 54 for 15 min at 4 °C. The complexes were pulled down by adding protein A beads (20 μl) and rotating the slurry for 45 min at 4 °C. Beads were washed four times with 1 ml of immunoprecipitation buffer, and RNA was eluted from the beads with 100 mm NaCl and 1% SDS at 65 °C for 10 min in an Eppendorf Thermomixer. RNA was phenol/chloroform-deproteinized and then ethanol-precipitated. RNA pellets were resuspended in water and stored at −70 °C. RT reactions were carried out using SuperScript II RT (Invitrogen) and random primers in a 20-μl volume following the manufacturer's protocol. RT reactions were diluted 1:10 with water, and cDNAs were used in PCR. To identify the spectrum of K protein-binding RNAs, we used full-length K protein as a bait in the yeast three-hybrid screen (25Sengupta D.J. Wickens M. Fields S. RNA. 1999; 5: 596-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In this screen, protein-RNA interaction is detected by the reconstitution of a transcriptional activator using two-hybrid proteins and RNA from a hybrid RNA library. The hybrid RNA molecule is recruited to the promoter of a reporter gene by binding to a hybrid protein consisting of the bacteriophage MS2 coat protein fused to the DNA-binding protein LexA. The hybrid RNA, in turn, recruits the hybrid RNA-binding protein of interest. The hybrid RNA consists of binding sites for the MS2 coat protein and the RNA sequence that binds the protein of interest. The RNA-binding protein is generated by fusing it to the transcriptional activation domain of the yeast Gal4 protein (25Sengupta D.J. Wickens M. Fields S. RNA. 1999; 5: 596-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar,30Sengupta D.J. Zhang B. Kraemer B. Pochart P. Fields S. Wickens M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8496-8501Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). Transformants were selected on yeast synthetic medium lacking leucine, histidine, uracil, tryptophan, and adenine. The His-deficient medium selected clones that expressed the HIS3 reporter gene driven by LexA DNA-binding elements. These clones were then tested by β-galactosidase assay for lacZ reporter gene expression also driven by LexA DNA-binding sites. The putative positive clones that failed to activate the lacZ reporter gene in the L40 cells in the absence of the pOAA-K protein plasmid were considered to be true positives. Five to ten million independent human RNA clones generated from total cellular RNA were screened. Forty-three true positive clones were identified. Unexpectedly, several positive clones represented mtRNAs (see Fig. 2 B). Sequencing of 20 randomly chosen plasmids from the hybrid cDNA library revealed no mtRNA sequences. This suggests that the cloning of mtRNA by K protein in the yeast three-hybrid system does not reflect overrepresentation of mitochondrial sequences in the cDNA library. Instead, these results suggest preferential K protein binding to mitochondrial transcripts in the yeast three-hybrid system. Computer-generated predictions of secondary structures of the RNAs (mfold)4 were used to determine any similar secondary structure among positive clones. The temperature was set at 37 °C, and 1 m NaCl was used during the calculation (27Zuker M. Mathews D.H. Turner D.H. Barciszewski J. Clark B.F.C. RNA Biochemistry and Biotechnology. NATO ASI Series, Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, NL1999: 11-43Crossref Google Scholar, 31Mathews D.H. Sabina J. Zuker M. Turner D.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 288: 911-940Crossref PubMed Scopus (3217) Google Scholar). This computer-based analysis did not identify shared secondary structure among the isolated RNA clones. To define the consensus K protein-binding motif, the primary RNA sequences of the positive clones were compared using the ClustalW program (28Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (55709) Google Scholar) for multiple alignment of the RNA fragments. All positive clones exhibited a strong blue color in the presence of X-gal. We used liquid assay for β-galactosidase activity to estimate the efficiency of interactions. The β-galactosidase activities ranged between 0.5 and 663 units and were compared with the results of alignments. A preliminary alignment was conducted only with those RNA sequences that exhibited β-galactosidase activity 25 units and above. The remaining sequences were added to the alignment manually using the BIOEdit program. 5www.mbio.ncsu.edu/BioEdit/bioedit.html. Analysis of the alignment revealed a tandem array of three C-rich patches with the following sequence: (C/U)(C/U)AUCN2–5C(C/U)ACC(C/A)N11–17UCA(C/U). The frequency of ribonucleotides at all positions of the 50-base alignment is shown in Fig. 1. The three C-rich patches (left, middle, andright) are shown. The high frequency of the single A and U in the left and right patches is easily seen. The frequency of a single A and a single U in the middle patch is lower. Mean cytosine content of the aligned regions was significantly higher than the mean cytosine content of the clones as a whole (p < 0.05). Cytosine content was 39.8%, adenine 25.4%, uracil 24.4%, and guanine 10.3% of the total. Thus, the overall K protein-binding RNAs are C-rich and G-poor. This is consistent with the observation that K protein strongly binds poly(C) RNA, but not poly(G) RNA (17Ostrowski J. Kawata Y. Schullery D. Denisenko O.N. Higaki Y. Abrass C.K. Bomsztyk K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9044-9049Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 32Van Seuningen I. Ostrowski J. Bomsztyk K. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 5644-5650Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). There was a strong correlation between K protein-binding affinities of the cloned RNAs and the number of sequence regions containing the three C-rich boxes of the predicted binding motif (Table I). This is not unexpected because RNA clones containing multiple copies of the consensus sequence would be expected to recruit multiple K protein molecules, resulting in proportionally stronger activation of thelacZ reporter gene.Table ISequences of the RNA clones isolated from the yeast three-hybrid system that exhibited the highest β-galactosidase (β-gal) activity of the lacZ reporter geneView Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Open table in a new tab To test the utility of the computationally derived K protein-binding motif, we carried out analysis of the 15-lipoxygenase (33Ostareck D.H.

The rabbit 15-lipoxygenase transcript contains three C-rich stretches in the regulatory region that agree well with the derived consensus sequence (Table II).

Three of these elements are located within the region known to be important in translational regulation of this viral transcript (16Collier B. Goobar-Larsson L. Sokolowski M. Schwartz S. J. Biol.

The mitochondrial genome is a double-stranded circular DNA. The human and mouse mitochondrial genomes are 16,598 and 16,295 bp long, respectively. Mitochondrial genomes are transcribed as polycistronic transcripts that are cleaved to generate 37 transcripts that encode 2 rRNAs, 22 tRNAs, and 13 mRNAs (34Taanman J.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1410: 103-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The small mitochondrial genome does not contain introns, making it possible to generate a complete mtRNA library directly from DNA. To identify the full spectrum of mtRNA sequences that bind K protein, we constructed such an RNA library in the pIIIMS2-2 plasmid using restriction fragments of the entire mouse mitochondrial genome. Using K protein as the RNA bait, we isolated 28 clones that activated both the His3 and lacZ reporter genes. As illustrated in Fig. 2 C, the isolated sequences span nearly the entire mouse mitochondrial genome, including both of the rRNAs and most of the protein genes. Mitochondria contain several hundred different proteins (35Rassow J. Pfanner N. Traffic. 2000; 1: 457-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The vast majority of mitochondrial proteins are encoded by the nuclear genes; these proteins are imported into mitochondria by specialized protein import pathways (35Rassow J. Pfanner N. Traffic. 2000; 1: 457-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Only 13 mitochondrial proteins are encoded by the mitochondrial genome and are synthesized in the organelle matrix (34Taanman J.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1410: 103-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). K protein is found in the cytoplasm and the nucleus (18Ostrowski J. Van Seuningen I. Seger R. Rouch C.T. Sleath P.R.

It has been reported that the high-energy phosphorylated enzyme intermediate exhibits a protein phosphotransferase activity toward the protein histidine kinases CheA and EnvZ, members of the two-component signal transduction systems in bacteria. Here we demonstrate that the apparent protein phosphotransferase activity of NDP kinase occurs only in the presence of ADP, which can mediate the phosphotransfer from the phospho-NDP kinase to the target enzymes in catalytic amounts (∼1 nm). These findings suggest that the protein kinase activity of NDP kinase is probably an artifact attributable to trace amounts of contaminating ADP. Additionally, we show thatEscherichia coli NDP kinase, like its human homologue NM23-H2/PuF/NDP kinase B, can bind and cleave DNA. Previous in vivo functions of E. coli NDP kinase in the regulation of gene expression that have been attributed to a protein phosphotransferase activity can be explained in the context of NDP kinase-DNA interactions. The conservation of the DNA binding and DNA cleavage activities between human and bacterial NDP kinases argues strongly for the hypothesis that these activities play an essential role in NDP kinase function in vivo.

Nucleoside-diphosphate (NDP) 1The abbreviations used are:NDPnucleoside-diphosphate 1The abbreviations used are:NDPnucleoside-diphosphate kinase (EC 2.7.4.6) catalyzes the exchange of a γ-phosphate between nucleoside tri- and diphosphates via a ping-pong mechanism with a high-energy phosphohistidine intermediate: REACTION SCHEMEwhere Mg·NDP and Mg·N′TP are the Mg2+ complexes with nucleoside (or 2′-deoxynucleoside) di- and triphosphates. Histidine phosphorylation by Mg·NTP is fully reversible with an equilibrium constant of about 0.25, and it is very efficient and has a turnover number > 1000 s−1. Thus, the phosphorylation and dephosphorylation steps take less than 1 ms, whereas the phosphorylated form is stable for a few hours in the absence of a nucleoside diphosphate acceptor (catalytic mechanism is reviewed in Ref. 1Lascu I. Gonin P. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 2000; 32: 237-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). NDP kinases are a large family of proteins found in many organisms with a high level of sequence and structure homology throughout the whole family. The enzyme is composed of four or six identical subunits (16–20 kDa each) with an α/β sandwich or ferredoxin fold (reviewed in Ref. 2Janin J. Dumas C. Morera S., Xu, Y. Meyer P. Chiadmi M. Cherfils J. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 2000; 32: 215-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). In both crystals and solution, NDP kinases exist in two different quaternary structures: eukaryotic enzymes are hexamers (a trimer of dimers with dihedral D3 symmetry), and some bacterial enzymes are tetramers (a pair of dimers with pyramidal D2 symmetry) (3Lascu I. Giartosio A. Ransac S. Erent M. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 2000; 32: 227-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Each subunit in the hexamer or tetramer has an independent active center that comprises the nucleophilic histidine and the nucleotide-binding site able to bind both di- and triphosphates. The binding site forms a cleft on the protein surface about 20 Å long, 6 Å wide, and 10 Å deep, with the phosphoaccepting histidine located at the bottom of this cleft. Amino acid compositions of the active sites and their structures are almost identical in the NDP kinases from bacteria to human (3Lascu I. Giartosio A. Ransac S. Erent M. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 2000; 32: 227-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The nucleoside-diphosphate kinase activity and the broad substrate specificity of the enzyme imply that it might play a central role in nucleotide metabolism by catalyzing the biosynthesis of nucleoside triphosphates from the corresponding diphosphates, with ATP as a phosphoryl donor. Surprisingly, however, it has been found that the Escherichia coli ndk gene is not essential and that deletion mutants are capable of normal growth (4Lu Q. Zhang X. Almaula N. Mathews C.K. Inouye M. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 254: 337-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). This result is consistent with the notion that the primary function of NM23/NDP kinase is not as a housekeeping nucleoside-diphosphate kinase. nucleoside-diphosphate nucleoside-diphosphate During the last 10 years, NM23/NDP kinases have been implicated in the regulation of tumor metastasis (5Hartsough M.T.

It has also been reported that the high-energy phosphorylated NDP kinase intermediate exhibits a protein phosphotransferase activity toward a number of important regulatory proteins, leading to the proposal that NDP kinases can participate in phosphorelay networks that regulate gene expression and metabolism.

J. 2000; 346: 623-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) have been identified as the phosphoaccepting residues in these proteins. Among the reported targets of the phosphotransferase activity of NDP kinase were the histidine protein kinases CheA and EnvZ (15Lu Q. Park H. Egger L.A. Inouye M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32886-32893Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), members of the two-component signal transduction systems in bacteria (21Stock A.M. Robinson V.L. Goudreau P.N. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 183-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (2450) Google Scholar). In these systems the activity of the first component, a histidine kinase, is regulated by different environmental factors. The kinases utilize ATP to phosphorylate their own histidine residue; the phosphoryl group is then transferred to an aspartyl residue in the molecule of the second, response regulator, component. The cytoplasmic histidine protein kinase CheA is the key enzyme in the system controlling bacterial chemotaxis. CheA activity is regulated by transmembrane chemoreceptors. EnvZ is a membrane receptor kinase that serves as an osmosensor in bacteria. It phosphorylates a cognate response regulator, OmpR, which activates porin gene transcription. The other proteins reportedly phosphorylated by NDP kinase were the energy metabolism enzymes succinic thiokinase (17Freije J.M. Blay P. MacDonald N.J. Manrow R.E. Steeg P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5525-5532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 18Wagner P.D. Steeg P.S. Vu N.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A. 1997; 94: 9000-9005Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The common feature of all of the reported targets of the phosphotransferase activity of NDP kinase is the presence of a histidine residue in the active center of the enzyme that is phosphorylated by ATP during their normal catalytic cycle in the absence of NDP kinase. Here we demonstrate that the apparent protein phosphotransferase activity of NDP kinase in two-component systems is an artifact resulting from the presence of catalytic amounts of nucleoside di- or triphosphates in the reaction mixtures, which mediate the phosphotransfer from the phospho-NDP kinase to the target enzymes. Part of the evidence supporting a role for E. coli NDP kinase in EnvZ function was the demonstration that ndk overexpression resulted in the transcriptional activation of genes that are controlled by the histidine kinase osmosensor (15Lu Q. Park H. Egger L.A. Inouye M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32886-32893Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). There is an alternative explanation for this result, however. It has been shown that changes in DNA structure associated with increases in osmotic pressure act cooperatively with OmpR phosphorylation to activate transcription (22Higgins C.F. Dorman C.J. Stirling D.A. Waddell L. Booth I.R. May G. Bremer E. Cell. 1988; 52: 569-584Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar).

Oncogene. 1995; 10: 2343-2347PubMed Google Scholar), it seemed likely that NDP kinase overproduction in some way mimicked the effect of high osmolarity on DNA to enhance expression of the OmpR-dependent genes. In light of this possibility, we examined whether E. coli NDP kinase, like its human counterpart NM23-H2/NDP kinase B (13Postel E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22821-22829Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 14Postel E.H. Abramczyk B.M. Levit M.N. Kyin S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In addition to being an NDP kinase, NM23-H2 is also a transcriptional activator (8Postel E.H. Berberich S.J. Flint S.J. Ferrone C.A.

Oncogene. 1995; 10: 2343-2347PubMed Google Scholar) that can form a covalent lysine-phosphodiester bond with DNA and catalyze DNA cleavage, suggesting that it is involved in changing the DNA structure (13Postel E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22821-22829Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 14Postel E.H. Abramczyk B.M. Levit M.N. Kyin S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 14194-14199Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The covalent bond between NM23-H2 and DNA is formed through an evolutionarily conserved lysine residue (Lys12), located in the nucleotide-binding site, which is also required for the NDP kinase activity (14Postel E.H. Abramczyk B.M. Levit M.N. Kyin S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 14194-14199Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Whether and how the nuclease and NDP kinase activities might be integrated for in vivo function are not known. Whereas E. coli encodes only one ndpk gene, there are eight orthologous NM23/NDP kinase genes in humans (23Lacombe M.L. Milon L. Munier A. Mehus J.G. Lambeth D.O. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 2000; 32: 247-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). NM23-H2 and the E. coli enzyme are 45% identical and, in addition to the catalytic lysine, share all of the important active site residues for NDP kinase. Here we show that, like the human enzyme, E. coli NDP kinase can indeed bind and cleave both supercoiled plasmid and duplex DNA oligonucleotides. The conservation of these enzymatic activities and the active site residues between human and E. coli enzymes indicates strongly that the NM23/NDP kinase family of proteins performs similar functions in all organisms that most likely involve both the NDP kinase and the DNA cleavage activities. CheA was purified as described previously (24Stock A. Chen T. Welsh D. Stock J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 1403-1407Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). A truncated EnvZ protein (EnvZ115) in which the first 38 amino acids of EnvZ are replaced with 8 amino acids of LacZ (25Igo M.M. Silhavy T.J. J.

Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 4538-4546Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and OmpR fused to the maltose-binding protein (OmpR-MBP) were all gifts from T. Silhavy (Princeton University). Human NM23-H2/NDP kinase B was purified by overexpressing plasmid p19PET3c in BL21 (DE3)E. coli cells, by ammonium sulfate fractionation, and passage through DEAE ion exchange and hydroxyapatite columns, as described previously (8Postel E.H. Berberich S.J. Flint S.J. Ferrone C.A. Science. 1993; 261: 478-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). NDP kinase from E. coli was prepared using the expression vector ndkec (a gift of M. Konrad, Max-Planck-Institute, Goettingen, Germany) and BL21 (DE3) E. coli cells. The enzyme was purified by ammonium sulfate fractionation and passage through DEAE ion exchange column, from which it was eluted with a 0–1 m NaCl gradient (peak fractions were eluted at ∼100 mm NaCl). E. coli NDP kinase provided by Ioan Lascu (University of Bordeaux-2) was prepared by Blue-Sepharose affinity chromatography. The purity of all NDP kinase preparations was assessed as >99% by SDS-PAGE analysis. The assays were conducted according to the method of Lu et al. (15Lu Q. Park H. Egger L.A. Inouye M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32886-32893Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Reactions were started by adding [γ-32P]ATP or [γ-32P]GTP to 20 μl of reaction buffer 1 (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 50 mmKCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 5 mmMgCl2) containing proteins as indicated in the figure legends. After incubation at 30 °C for 30 min, 5 μl of 5× SDS sample buffer (60 mm Tris-Cl, pH 6.8, 25% glycerol, 2% SDS, 7.2 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 0.1% bromphenol blue) were added to each reaction mixture, and aliquots were subjected to 15% SDS-PAGE analysis. Gels were dried and autoradiographed. [γ-32P]GTP and [γ-32P]ATP (4500 Ci/mmol, 10 mCi/ml on the reference day) were obtained from ICN. Ten-μl reaction mixtures were assembled in reaction buffer 2 (50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.9, 100 mm KCl, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 50 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 2% (v/v) glycerol) with negatively supercoiled plasmid DNA (pUC19MYC) containing a 57-bp c-MYC NHE sequence as described previously (13Postel E.H.

After incubation for 30 min at 30 °C, the reactions were terminated with 2% sarkosyl and 10 mm EDTA and further treated with proteinase K (200 μg/ml) for 1 h at 55 °C before electrophoresis on 1% agarose gels (13Postel E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22821-22829Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Reaction mixtures were assembled in 14 μl of reaction buffer 2 with the indicated amounts of32P-end-labeled 45-bp duplex NHE oligonucleotide with the sequence 5′-AGTCTCCTCCCCACCTTCCCCACCCTCCCCACCCTCCCCATAAGC-3′ and NM23-H2 or E. coli NDP kinase as indicated in the figure legends. After incubation at 0 °C for 20 min, the samples were analyzed by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (13Postel E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22821-22829Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 14Postel E.H. Abramczyk B.M. Levit M.N. Kyin S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 14194-14199Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). NDP kinase activity was measured with ATP as a phosphate donor and dTDP as an acceptor nucleotide, in a coupled pyruvate kinase-lactate dehydrogenase assay that measures ADP formation from ATP, as described previously (14Postel E.H. Abramczyk B.M. Levit M.N. Kyin S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 14194-14199Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The specific activities of the human NM23-H2 enzyme and E. coli NDP kinase were similar (620–800 units/mg, respectively). To examine whether the phosphoryl group can be transferred directly from NDP kinase to the bacterial protein histidine kinases CheA or EnvZ, we incubated preparations of the purified human NM23-H2 or E. coli NDP kinase with the purified target proteins, CheA and EnvZ, in the presence of [γ-32P]GTP as described by Lu et al. (15Lu Q. Park H. Egger L.A. Inouye M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32886-32893Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Because GTP can serve as a substrate for autophosphorylation of NDP kinase but not for CheA and EnvZ, appearance of the phosphorylated forms of the latter would be evidence of direct phosphotransfer from the phospho-NDP kinase. Products of the reaction were separated by SDS-PAGE and visualized by autoradiography (Fig. 1). We used a wild type CheA protein (Fig. 1 A) and an EnvZ115 mutant (Fig.1 B), a truncated EnvZ protein in which the first 38 amino acids, including the first transmembrane sequence and a part of the extracellular region, are replaced with 8 amino acids of LacZ (25Igo M.M. Silhavy T.J. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 5971-5973Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). As a positive control, CheA and EnvZ115 were phosphorylated in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP (Fig. 1 A, lane 1 and Fig. 1 B, lane 1, respectively). As an additional control for the intactness of the phosphoacceptor-phosphodonor properties of the EnvZ115 mutant, we demonstrated that phospho-EnvZ can phosphorylate its cognate response regulator protein, OmpR (Fig. 1 B, lane 2). We confirmed that the protein histidine kinases CheA (Fig. 1 A, lane 2) and EnvZ115 (Fig. 1 B, lane 3) cannot be phosphorylated by [γ-32P]GTP. Whereas the NDP kinase from E. coli and the human NM23-H2 were both phosphorylated by [γ-32P]GTP, we were not able to observe phosphotransfer to CheA (Fig. 1 A, lanes 3 and 4) or EnvZ115 (Fig. 1 B, lanes 5 and 13). However, the phosphorylated forms of CheA and EnvZ115 were observed when ADP was added at concentrations from 1 to 1000 nm (Fig. 1 A, lanes 5–11 and Fig. 1 B, lanes 6–8). Phosphorylation was not observed with EnvZ N342K, a kinase-negative mutant that is inactive (26Hsing W. Russo F.D. Bernd K.K. Silhavy T.J. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 4538-4546Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 1 B, lanes 9–12). Phosphorylation of the protein histidine kinases CheA and EnvZ in the mixtures with NDP kinase and [γ-32P]GTP is not a result of direct phosphotransfer from the phospho-NDP kinase but rather a consequence of generation of [γ-32P]ATP from the added (or contaminating) ADP (Fig. 2). The generated [γ-32P]ATP is used by the protein histidine kinase as its natural substrate in the autophosphorylation reaction, and the ADP that is produced is recycled at the expense of GTP by the nucleoside-diphosphate kinase reaction. Thus, ADP functions as a catalyst (i.e. it is not consumed), and even trace amounts of ADP can mediate the phosphotransfer. The concentration of ADP in the reaction mixture does affect the rate of phosphotransfer (comparelanes 5–11 in Fig. 1 A with lanes 6–8in Fig. 1 B), however, so that one's ability to register the phosphotransfer depends on the sensitivity of the analytical method and reaction parameters (autoradiographic exposure time, incubation condition, and so forth). ADP or ATP in a catalytic concentration that can promote the phosphotransfer cascade may not be easily detected. In our experiments, these concentrations (≥1 nm) were approximately 1 order of magnitude lower than the detection limit of the thin layer chromatography assay, which was used by Lu et al. (15Lu Q. Park H. Egger L.A. Inouye M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32886-32893Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) to demonstrate the absence of trace amounts of ADP/ATP in their reaction mixtures. In the experiments where the protein phosphotransferase activity of NDP kinase was reportedly observed, the enzyme was not in catalytic but rather in stoichiometric (micromolar) concentrations comparable with those of the target protein kinases. Concentrations of ADP/ATP in the reaction mixture 3 orders of magnitude lower than the concentration of these nucleotide-binding proteins would be sufficient to promote the phosphotransfer reactions that were observed (15Lu Q. Park H. Egger L.A. Inouye M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32886-32893Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). We have recently identified the human homologue of E. coli NDP kinase, NM23-H2, as a nuclease capable of covalently binding and cleaving DNA (13Postel E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22821-22829Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The active site amino acid residue through which NM23-H2 covalently binds to DNA is an evolutionarily conserved lysine (Lys12). Mutation of Lys12 to Ala or Gln, amino acids that do not have the functional amino group, abolished the covalent DNA binding and cleavage but not the noncovalent DNA binding by NM23-H2 (14Postel E.H. Abramczyk B.M. Levit M.N. Kyin S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 14194-14199Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Because Lys12 (Lys11 inE. coli) and other residues in the catalytic pocket of NDP kinase are fully conserved, we hypothesized that E. coli NDP kinase should also be able to bind and cleave DNA. This was confirmed experimentally. E. coli NDP kinase, like its human counterparts (13Postel E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22821-22829Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 14Postel E.H. Abramczyk B.M. Levit M.N. Kyin S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

We also compared by electrophoretic mobility shift assay the DNA binding and cleaving activities of the two enzymes using oligonucleotides comprising the NM23-H2 natural target sequence, the c-MYC promoter termed NHE (8Postel E.H. Berberich S.J. Flint S.J. Ferrone C.A. Science. 1993; 261: 478-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.4 with a 45-bp32P-end-labeled duplex DNA, E. coli NDP kinase was also active toward this substrate, although, as in the case of the plasmid DNA cleavage, its activity was less than that of the human enzyme. The lower activity of the E. coli enzyme may be explained on the basis that the sequence-dependent DNA binding by E. coli NDP kinase and NM23-H2 is different. Indeed, even the DNA sequences recognized by NM23-H1, which has an 89% identity to NM23-H2, are different (10Postel E.H. Berberich S.J. Rooney J.W. Kaetzel D.M. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 2000; 32: 277-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). As we have shown previously for NM23-H2 (13Postel E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22821-22829Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), ATP inhibits the cleaving activity but not the DNA binding activity of the E. coli enzyme (Fig. 3, lanes 6 and 12, and Fig. 4, lanes 4 and7). This may be a result of competition between DNA and ATP for binding to the nucleotide binding/NDPK phosphorylation site, which is shared or overlaps with the nuclease active site that includes the catalytic lysine (14Postel E.H. Abramczyk B.M. Levit M.N. Kyin S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 14194-14199Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). All of the observed nucleic acid/nucleotide chemistries catalyzed by E. coli NDP kinase appear to be associated with the same form of the enzyme during E. coliNDP kinase purification because the DNA binding, DNA cleavage, and NDP kinase activities precisely coelute with the purified NDP kinase protein (Fig. 5).Figure 5Coelution of DNA binding, DNA cleavage, and NDP kinase activities of E. coli recombinant NDP kinase from a DEAE column.

NDP kinase activity (○) was measured as described under “Materials and Methods.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) NDP kinases were originally proposed to be pivotal as housekeeping enzymes largely responsible for shuttling γ-phosphoryl groups from ATP to all the various NTPs and deoxynucleotide triphosphates. During the last decade, a large body of evidence has been collected regarding their involvement in the regulation of gene expression during development, tumorigenesis, and tumor metastasis (reviewed in Ref. 9Postel E.H. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1998; 30: 1291-1295Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Additionally, NDP kinases were proposed by Lu et al. (15Lu Q. Park H. Egger L.A. Inouye M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32886-32893Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) to participate in signal transduction by functioning as protein phosphotransferases. These authors reported the possibility of phosphotransfer from E. coli NDP kinase to the active site histidine in the E. coli EnvZ and CheA histidine protein kinases. This observation indicated that NDP kinase could provide a general bypass mechanism for the global activation of this important class of regulatory kinases. We have not been able to reproduce this finding using purified NDP kinase, CheA, and EnvZ proteins. Moreover, we have shown that nanomolar concentrations of contaminating ADP, which were almost certainly present in the previously reported in vitro experiments, could have easily accounted for the putative phosphotransfer activity. It has also been reported that the phosphoryl group can be transferred from the phospho-NDP kinase to the histidine residue in the catalytic site of several other proteins, the energy metabolism enzymes succinic thiokinase (succinyl-CoA synthetase, EC 6.2.1.4) (17Freije J.M.

Chem. 1997; 272: 5525-5532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). In these experiments, phospho-NDP kinase was generated by incubation with [γ-32P]ATP and followed by removal of the bulk free [γ-32P]ATP by either size exclusion chromatography or successive rounds of dilution and ultrafiltration. By means of these procedures, the content of [γ-32P]ATP in the preparations of phospho-NDP kinase was decreased to the molar ratios (ATP/NDP kinase) of 1:40 (16Wagner P.D. Vu N.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21758-21764Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar), 1:1000 (17Freije J.M. Blay P. MacDonald N.J. Manrow R.E. Steeg P.S. J. Biol.

A. 1997; 94: 9000-9005Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), as stated in the publications. To demonstrate that phosphorylation of the target proteins is a result of direct phosphotransfer from the phospho-NDP kinase and not a consequence of their phosphorylation by the residual [γ-32P]ATP, in the negative control experiments the target proteins were incubated with [γ-32P]ATP taken in the low “residual” concentrations, sometimes in the presence of unlabeled NDP kinase (16Wagner P.D. Vu N.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21758-21764Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar) or the kinase with mutated histidine residue in the active center (17Freije J.M. Blay P. MacDonald N.J. Manrow R.E. Steeg P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5525-5532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). However, the absence of detectable amounts of the phosphorylated target proteins in these controls may result from the fact that the amount of the labeled phosphoryl groups present in the reaction was at least 1 order of magnitude lower here than in the reactions where the phospho-NDP kinase was present. In the experiments described above, it was the phospho-NDP kinase that served as a major source of the phosphoryl groups, and the contaminating ATP functioned more as a catalyst in the phosphotransfer cascade than a substrate supplying the phosphoryl groups. NDP kinase has been found to phosphorylate the serine/threonine residues in the proteins in cell extracts (19Engel M. Veron M. Theisinger B. Lacombe M.L. Seib T. Dooley S. Welter C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 234: 200-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) and the aspartate residue in aldolase C (18Wagner P.D. Steeg P.S. Vu N.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9000-9005Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 20Wagner P.D. Vu N.D. Biochem. J. 2000; 346: 623-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). These reactions required stoichiometric rather than catalytic amounts of the phospho-NDP kinase, and they were greatly accelerated by the presence of urea (19Engel M. Veron M. Theisinger B. Lacombe M.L. Seib T. Dooley S. Welter C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 234: 200-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) or sodium cholate (20Wagner P.D. Vu N.D. Biochem. J. 2000; 346: 623-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). It is likely that reactions in this case were essentially nonenzymatic processes, i.e. the nucleophilic, phosphoaccepting residues were interacting with the phosphohistidine, a strong phosphorylating agent, in the unfolded proteins. Crystal structures of NDP kinase show that the catalytic histidine is located at the bottom of the nucleotide-binding cleft (2Janin J. Dumas C. Morera S., Xu, Y. Meyer P. Chiadmi M. Cherfils J. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 2000; 32: 215-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), which is not compatible with the possibility of direct contact between the phosphohistidine and a residue in another protein in the absence of major conformational changes. Lu et al. (15Lu Q. Park H. Egger L.A. Inouye M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32886-32893Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) also reported that NDP kinase overexpression caused EnvZ-mediated transcriptional activation of gene expression. There is an explanation for this result that is unrelated to EnvZ function, however. It has been shown that changes in DNA structure associated with increases in osmotic pressure act cooperatively with EnvZ-mediated phosphorylation events to activate transcription (22Higgins C.F. Dorman C.J. Stirling D.A. Waddell L. Booth I.R. May G. Bremer E. Cell. 1988; 52: 569-584Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar). Given the recently established role of NM23-H2/NDP kinase B in DNA structural changes (13Postel E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22821-22829Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 14Postel E.H. Abramczyk B.M. Levit M.N. Kyin S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 14194-14199Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), it seems likely that NDP kinase overproduction in some way mimicked the effects of high osmolarity on DNA to enhance the expression of EnvZ-regulated genes. We have previously identified human NM23-H2/NDP kinase as a DNA-binding transcriptional activator (8Postel E.H. Berberich S.J. Flint S.J. Ferrone C.A. Science. 1993; 261: 478-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar, 9Postel E.H. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1998; 30: 1291-1295Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 10Postel E.H.

Oncogene. 1995; 10: 2343-2347PubMed Google Scholar) and, more recently, as a DNA-cleaving enzyme (13Postel E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22821-22829Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Because of the high level of conservation of residues in the catalytic pocket, we hypothesized that other members of the NM23/NDP kinase family, including the E. coli enzyme, should have a similar DNA cleaving activity. Using duplex DNA oligonucleotides and supercoiled plasmid DNA (13Postel E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22821-22829Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), we have confirmed that the E. coli enzyme does indeed bind and cleave DNA. The degree of conservation of structure and function between human andE. coli NDP kinase and NM23-H2 is a strong indicator that members of the NM23/NDP kinase family of proteins perform similar biological roles that most likely involve both NDP kinase and DNA cleavage activities. There is evidence suggesting that NM23/NDP kinases are involved in DNA repair (4Lu Q. Zhang X. Almaula N. Mathews C.K. Inouye M. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 254: 337-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 14Postel E.H. Abramczyk B.M. Levit M.N. Kyin S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 14194-14199Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) as well as transcription. This type of activity would fit nicely with the function of NM23/NDP kinases in development and cancer. We thank I. Lascu for the gift of E. coli NDP kinase, M. Konrad for the ndke plasmid, and T. Silhavy for the EnvZ and OmpR-MBP proteins."

A homology search revealed that the human spinesin gene was located at chromosome 11q23 and contained 13 exons, the gene structure being similar to that of TMPRSS3 whose gene is also located on 11q23. Spinesin has a simple type II transmembrane structure, consisting of, from the N terminus, a short cytoplasmic domain, a transmembrane domain, a stem region containing a scavenger receptor-like domain, and a serine protease domain. Unlike TMPRSS3, it carries no low density lipoprotein receptor domain in the stem region. The extracellular region carries fiveN-glycosylation sites. The sequence of the protease domain carried the essential triad His, Asp, and Ser and showed some similarity to that of TMPRSS2, hepsin, HAT, MT-SP1, TMPRSS3, and corin, sharing 45.5, 41.9, 41.3, 40.3, 39.1, and 38.5% identity, respectively. The putative mature protease domain preceded by H6DDDDK was produced in Escherichia coli, purified, and successfully activated by immobilized enterokinase. Its optimal pH was about 10. It cleaved synthetic substrates for trypsin, which is inhibited by p-amidinophenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride but not by antipain or leupeptin. Northern blot analysis against mRNA from human tissues including liver, lung, placenta, and heart demonstrated a specific expression of spinesin mRNA in the brain. Immunohistochemically, spinesin was predominantly expressed in neurons, in their axons, and at the synapses of motoneurons in the spinal cord. In addition, some oligodendrocytes were clearly stained. These results indicate that spinesin is transported to the synapses through the axons after its synthesis in the cytoplasm and may play important roles at the synapses.

The stem region varies in length and contains various modulatory domains. The length of these proteases ranges from 400 to over 1000 amino acid residues. The longest is corin at 1042 residues (4Yan W. Sheng N. Seto M. Morser J. Wu Q. J. Biol.

Neurosin and hippostasin, whose genes are found on chromosome 19q13.3, are secreted and belong to the kallikrein-like serine protease family. Motopsin, whose gene is located on chromosome 5, has a unique and complicated structure similar to TMPRSS, including, from the N terminus, a proline-rich domain, a kringle domain, three scavenger receptor cysteine-rich domains, and a protease domain. However, motopsin has a putative signal sequence at the N terminus without an obvious hydrophobic transmembrane domain and thus would appear to be a secreted protease. As part of our continuing efforts to characterize serine proteases from the CNS, we have cloned from a human spinal cord mRNA pool a TMPRSS that we designated spinesin or TMPRSS5. As far as we know, this is the first report of a TMPRSS identified in the CNS. Human tissues of the CNS for immunohistological analyses were obtained with informed consent within 12 h of death. Cerebrospinal fluids (CSFs) were obtained with informed consent from patients with non-central nervous system diseases. Human brain mRNA, multiple tissue Northern blots, and tissue extracts were purchased from CLONTECH (Palo Alto, CA). Tissue culture media, supplements, pTrcHisB vector, and competentEscherichia coli DH5α cells were from Invitrogen. All other chemicals were obtained from Wako Chemicals (Osaka, Japan). Rabbit polyclonal antibodies for Western blotting and immunohistochemical analyses were raised against two KLH-conjugated peptides, KLH-CSEASAEEALLP (anti-human spinesin A) and KLH-CAGLVSHSAVRPHQG (anti-human spinesin B), and purified using protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). The former peptide sequence is derived from the stem region, and the latter was derived from the protease domain (see Fig. 1). Poly (A)+ RNA from human CNS (CLONTECH) was reverse-transcribed by using the SuperScript Preamplification System (Invitrogen) according to the instruction manual. PCR with a pair of degenerate primers, DP-S and DP-A (Table I), was performed as described previously (22Yamamura Y. Yamashiro K. Tsuruoka N. Nakazato H. Tsujimura A. Yamaguchi N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 239: 386-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 24Mitsui S. Tsuruoka N. Yamashiro K. Nakazato H. Yamaguchi N. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 260: 627-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The PCR products were ligated into the pGEM-T Easy vector (Promega, Madison, WI), cloned, and sequenced using an automatic sequencer (DSQ-1000, Shimadzu Co., Kyoto Japan). A clone carrying a 465-bp fragment was found to have a novel serine protease-related sequence. Based on this sequence, specific primers were synthesized for the rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE, Table I). For 3′-RACE, human CNS poly(A)+ RNA was reverse-transcribed using oligo(dT) with an adaptor primer sequence at the 5′-end, TGGAAGAATACGCGGCCGCAGT17. The cDNA was then amplified using forward primer 1 and the adaptor primer, the products of which were further amplified by nested PCR using primer 2 and the adaptor primer. 5′-RACE was performed using a Marathon cDNA amplification kit (CLONTECH) according to the instruction manual. In brief, nested PCR with AP2 and primer 3 was performed using products of PCR with primer 4 and AP1 as a template.Table IPCR primersNameSequenceDP-SGTGCTCACNGCNGCBCAYTGDP-AAGCGGNCCNCCDSWRTCVCCPrimer 1ACTGCTGCACATTGTATGPrimer 2GCTCTCAACTTCTCAGACACPrimer 3AGGGGGCCCCCGCTATCTCCPrimer 4ACTCAGCTACCTTGGCGTAGAPrimer 5GCTTTACAACAGTGCTACTGACPrimer 6AAGGAATTCGAGGAAACAGCAGGACTCAGAAdaptor primerTGGAAGAATACGCGGCCGCAGAP1CCATCCTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGCAP2ACTCACTATAGGGCTCGAGCGGC Open table in a new tab Northern blot hybridization against human multiple tissues was carried out using a commercially available membrane (CLONTECH). The cDNA carrying the full-length human spinesin open reading frame amplified using primers 5 and 6 was labeled by the random labeling method using a Takara BcaBEST labeling kit (Takara Shuzo Co. Ltd., Shiga, Japan). Hybridization was carried out in ExpressHyb hybridization solution (CLONTECH) at 60 °C overnight, and the final wash was performed in 0.1× saline/sodium phosphate/EDTA containing 0.1% SDS at room temperature for 10 min. The radioactivity was detected using an FLA-2000 image analyzer (Fuji Photo Film Co. Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). The CNS including spinal cord from a non-neurological patient (65-year-old Japanese male) was obtained 2–12 h after death. Small blocks were dissected and fixed in 0.1 m phosphate-buffered 4% paraformaldehyde for 2 days and then stored in 0.1 m phosphate-buffered saline containing 15% sucrose and 0.1% sodium azide and kept at −70 °C until use. Sections were cut on a cryostat at 20-μm thickness and washed in phosphate-buffered saline. The antibody, diluted 1:2000 with phosphate-buffered saline-Tween, was incubated with the specimens at 4 °C for 48 h. After a wash with phosphate-buffered saline-Tween, the slides were incubated with alkaline phosphatase-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG for 60 min at room temperature. After another wash, immunoreactivity was visualized with 4-nitroblue tetrazolium chloride and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate. Counter staining was not performed. To obtain an active recombinant spinesin, a cDNA fragment encoding the putative mature enzyme of spinesin (Ile218–Leu457) was amplified by PCR (forward primer, ATAGTTGGTGGGCAGTCTGT; reverse primer, primer 6 in Fig. 1) and subcloned into pTrcHisB between the BamHI site, which had been treated with mung bean exonuclease following the instructions of the manufacturer, and the EcoRI site. The resultant vector carrying chimera cDNA encoding H6DDDDK-(218I–L457) was transformed into DH5α, and the recombinant protein was induced using 0.7 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. The recombinant protein in the cells from 100 ml of culture, mostly in inclusion bodies, was collected and suspended in 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 0.2 m NaCl and 1% Triton X-100. The suspension (5 ml) was sonicated, and inclusion bodies were collected by centrifugation and resuspended. After three rounds of sonication and centrifugation, the final pellet was dissolved with 5 ml of 8 m urea in the same buffer without Triton X-100 by sonication and shaken at room temperature for 1 h. Then the solution was diluted 10 times with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 0.2 m NaCl under vigorous stirring and centrifuged for 30 min at 3,500 rpm to remove debris. The supernatant was applied to a Talon column (1 × 1 cm) equilibrated with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 0.2 m NaCl. Following a sufficient wash (20 ml) with the same buffer containing 15 mm imidazole, spinesin was eluted by 100 mmimidazole in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 0.2m NaCl. After the removal of imidazole using a PD-10 desalting column (1 × 5 cm) equilibrated with 20 mmTris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, containing 0.2 m NaCl, spinesin was activated by incubation with recombinant enterokinase (EK Max, Invitrogen) immobilized onN-hydroxysuccinimide-Sepharose (1 ml) (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) for 30 min at room temperature to remove the H6DDDDK sequence. Five μl of the enzyme activated by the enterokinase column was incubated with 100 μl (20 μm) of various synthetic peptide substrates, i.e.Boc-Gln-Ala-Arg-MCA, Boc-Phe-Ser-Arg-MCA, Bz-Arg-MCA, Boc-Val-Leu-Lys-MCA, Pyr-Gly-Arg-MCA, Pro-Phe-Arg-MCA, Boc-Val-Pro-Arg-MCA, Z-Arg-Arg-MCA, Arg-MCA, or Z-Phe-Arg-MCA (Peptide Inst. Inc., Osaka, Japan) in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 0.2 m NaCl at 37 °C. After a 30-min incubation, the fluorescence (excitation at 380 nm, emission at 460 nm) was measured using a plate reader (Cytofluor 2300, Millipore, Bedford, MA). The effect of pH on the activity of spinesin treated with 0.01 unit of recombinant enterokinase was tested using Boc-Gln-Ala-Arg-MCA as a substrate in either 0.1 m phosphate buffer or 0.1m Tris-HCl buffer that contained 0.2 m NaCl. The reaction was carried out under the conditions described above. An inhibitor profile was obtained by preincubating for 30 min at 37 °C with a final concentration of 1 μm p-amidinophenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride, 1 mm leupeptin, or 1 mm antipain. The remaining enzyme activity was expressed relative to a control value obtained by adding buffer without inhibitor. Gelatin or casein (270 μg/ml) was copolymerized in a standard 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The activated recombinant spinesin (100 ng) was electrophoresed at a constant current of 20 mA under nonreducing condition. The gel was washed with 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.2 m NaCl containing 1% Triton X-100 at 37 °C for 3 h and then incubated in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 0.2 mNaCl at 37 °C overnight. The gel was stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. The samples were applied to a 12.5% polyacrylamide gel containing SDS and electrophoresed. The separated proteins were transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and then incubated overnight at room temperature with anti-human spinesin A or B diluted 2000-fold with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 0.05% Tween 20 and 0.2 m NaCl. After a wash with the same buffer, the membrane was incubated with alkaline phosphatase-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG for 60 min at room temperature. After another wash, immunoreactivity was visualized with 4-nitroblue tetrazolium chloride and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate. PCR using degenerate primers designed from serine protease motifs, AAHC and DSGGP, amplified a 465-bp fragment from a cDNA library of human spinal cord. Further detailed study of the library was performed since the sequence analysis of the fragment showed that it encoded a novel serine protease. The longest clone of the 3′-RACE products obtained using primer 2 and adaptor primer contained 1213 bp including a poly(A) tract. The sequence of the 5′-RACE product was 1381 bp long, and its 3′-end overlapped with the 5′-end of the 3′-RACE product (TableI), enabling the determination of the apparent full-length cDNA of 2265 bp including the 5′- and 3′-untranslated region for a novel serine protease. The longest open reading frame was 1371 bp, which encoded 457 amino acids. This protein was termed spinesin for spinal cord-enriched trypsin-like protease. A homology search against the GenBankTM data base showed that the human spinesin gene spanned 18.8 kb on chromosome 11 and was composed of 13 exons and 12 introns (Fig. 1). The GT-AG rule for exon-intron boundaries was conserved except for the 5′-donor site of the eighth intron, the sequence of which was GC. The cDNA sequence contained three possible initiation codons at the 5′-end, the third codon conforming best to the Kozak consensus sequence (Fig.1). Hydropathy plots (Fig.2) revealed an apparent hydrophobic region at Ala50–Leu72, suggesting it to be a transmembrane portion. Both ends of the transmembrane sequence are flanked by a Cys residue that might form a disulfide bond with another Cys residue on each side of the membrane. Five putativeN-glycosylation sites exist on the sequence C-terminal to the transmembrane portion, suggesting that the molecule is a type II transmembrane glycoprotein (Figs. 1 and 2). Accordingly the N-terminal cytoplasmic domain and the N-terminal sequence of the stem region between the transmembrane and scavenger receptor-like domain (see below) each carry only two Cys residues that might form a disulfide bridge on each side of the membrane, i.e.Cys41–Cys49 and Cys73–Cys93. A serine protease domain was located at Ile218–Leu457 in the C-terminal half of the molecule and contained the HDS (His, Asp, Ser) triad essential for catalytic activity of a serine protease (Figs. 1, 2, and3). The stem region connecting the transmembrane and catalytic domains spans from Cys73 to Arg217 and carries a scavenger receptor-like domain at Val110–Gly152 that contains two cysteines that probably form a disulfide bond, Cys135–Cys148(15Hooper J.D. Clements J.A. Quigley J.P. Antalis T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 857-860Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). The disulfide bridge linking pro- and catalytic domains seems to be formed between Cys209 and Cys328, which are conserved among TMPRSSs (Fig. 3) (15Hooper J.D. Clements J.A. Quigley J.P. Antalis T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 857-860Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). A homology search using the protease domain of spinesin showed that it shares 45.5, 41.9, 41.3, 40.3, 39.1, and 38.5% amino acids with human TMPRSS2, hepsin, HAT, MT-SP1, TMPRSS3, and corin, respectively (Fig.3). Nine of 10 cysteine residues in the mature enzyme domain of spinesin were well conserved among other TMPRSSs. A putative cleavage site for processing to generate a mature form is tentatively assigned between Arg217 and Ile218, which is in the highly conserved activation motif of the serine protease (15Hooper J.D. Clements J.A. Quigley J.P. Antalis T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 857-860Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). Of the five putative N-glycosylation sites, three are in the stem region, and two are in the mature enzyme region (Fig. 2).Figure 3Amino acid alignment of protease domains of spinesin and representative human TMPRSSs.

The products were purified from extensively washed and solubilized inclusion bodies using Talon chelate column chromatography. SDS-PAGE of the purified protein showed a single band (Fig.4 A, left,lane 5) of 30 kDa, which was immunoreactive with the anti-human spinesin B in Western blot analysis (Fig. 4 A,right, lane 5). The purified recombinant spinesin was activated by treatment with an immobilized enterokinase column to remove H6DDDDK. The activated spinesin cleaved the synthetic trypsin substrate Boc-Gln-Ala-Arg-MCA (Fig.5 A). Using this substrate, the pH optimum was estimated to be about pH 10 (Fig. 5 B).p-Amidinophenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride inhibited spinesin activity by more than 75% at 1 μm, but antipain and leupeptin showed no inhibitory effect at 1 mm (Fig. 5 C).Figure 5Enzymatic characteristics of the recombinant spinesin.

Interestingly casein is not cleaved by the activated recombinant spinesin (data not shown). First, Northern blot analysis was performed to see which human tissues produce spinesin mRNA using a commercially available RNA blot. A clear band was observed at 2.3 kbp in brain but not in kidney, liver, lung, placenta, or heart suggesting a specific expression of spinesin in the CNS (Fig. 6). The presence of spinesin was verified by Western blot analysis of human brain homogenate, which showed a protein band at 52 kDa that was detectable with anti-human spinesin A anti-serum (Fig. 4 C). The size suggests that it is a full-length spinesin with possibly fiveN-glycosylated sugar chains. No other distinct bands were apparent using anti-human spinesin B suggesting that the 52-kDa protein is the major molecule present in the brain (data not shown). Spinesin was also detected in the CSF. In some cases, a more rapidly migrating band at about 50 kDa seems dominant (Fig. 4 C, lanes 2 and 4). Detailed immunohistochemical analysis using anti-human spinesin A showed that at the anterior horn of the spinal cord, neuronal cells and their axons were stained (Fig.7 A). The transverse section of the spinal cord revealed many axons to be positively stained (Fig.7 B), and among the oligodendrocytes, sporadic staining of the cytoplasm and dendrites was evident (Fig. 7 C). In addition, the synapses on motor neurons were also stained (Fig.7 D). Neuronal cells of the substantia nigra and oculomotor nerve were also strongly stained as well as their axons (data not shown). We have cloned a cDNA encoding a serine protease, designated spinesin or TMPRSS5, of a tentative size of 457 amino acid residues from a human spinal cord cDNA library. It apparently belongs to the TMPRSS family having an N-terminal cytoplasmic domain, a transmembrane domain, a scavenger receptor-like domain in the stem region, and a protease domain. As far as we know, this is the first report of a TMPRSS cloned and identified from CNS. A homology search against GenBankTM showed that the spinesin gene is located on chromosome 11q23 where TMPRSS3 gene is also located; human MT-SP1 is located on the same chromosome. On the other hand, human enterokinase and TMPRSS2 are located at 21q21 and 21q22.3, respectively. Interestingly the gene structure of spinesin is highly similar to that of TMPRSS3 (11Scott H.S. Kudoh J. Wattenhofer M. Shibuya K. Berry A. Chrast R. Guipponi M. Wang J. Kawasaki K. Asakawa S. Minoshima S. Younus F. Mehdi S.Q. Radhakrishna U. Papasavvas M.P. Gehrig C. Rossier C. Korostishevsky M. Gal A. Shimizu N. Bonne-Tamir B. Antonarakis S.E. Nat. Genet. 2001; 27: 59-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Both are composed of 13 exons spanning 21–24 kb. The protease domain is encoded on exons 8–13, and the transmembrane domain is encoded on the exons 3 and 4. The stem region is encoded on exons 4–8. The gene structure of both human hepsin and TMPRSS2 is also similar to that of spinesin, so it seems possible that the TMPRSS gene family share a common ancestor, although they are located on independent chromosomes. Like TMPRSS2 and TMPRSS3, spinesin has a rather short sequence. Although the longest open reading frame of human spinesin was estimated to be 457 amino acids, the first initiation codon might be a pseudo-codon. It is located on the first exon that is noncoding in the case of TMPRSS3. Two other possible initiation codons present within 30 bp downstream of the first codon are located on the second exon where the initiation codon for TMPRSS3 resides. The third initiation codon best matches the Kozak consensus sequence and may thus be the actual initiation codon. This would make the length of the spinesin 447 amino acid residues. However, further analysis is required to elucidate the real initiation site(s). Spinesin has a rather simple domain structure carrying only a scavenger receptor-like domain in the stem region like TMPRSS2 and TMPRSS3. The latter two have, in addition, a low density lipoprotein receptor class A domain. Whereas the other domains are considerably different, the serine protease domains share a high degree of amino acid sequence identity among TMPRSSs. In the protease domain, spinesin showed the highest degree of similarity with TMPRSS2, sharing 45.5% identity of amino acids, followed by TMPRSS3 at 39.1%. These enzymes are activated by some as yet unidentified processing enzyme(s) that cleaves the amide bond C-terminal to a lysine or arginine residue in a highly conserved activation site. By analogy with hepsin, we assigned the cleavage site between Arg217–Ile218, which precedes Ile218-Val-Gly-Gly, the well conserved N-terminal sequence among other activated TMPRSSs (Fig. 3). Actually when a chimeric recombinant spinesin produced in E. coli was purified and cleaved at the site corresponding to Arg217–Ile218 of spinesin (Fig. 1), it showed enzymatic activity against synthetic substrates for trypsin, kallikrein, and plasminogen activator. This result is in accordance with the presence of an aspartate six residues before the catalytic serine (Fig. 3), which would be positioned at the bottom of the S1 substrate binding pocket like in other TMPRSS (1La Vallie E.R. Rehemtulla A. Racie L.A. DiBlasio E.A. Ferenz C. Grant K.L. Light A. McCoy J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23311-23317Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 3). By analogy also, we predict that the cleaved catalytic domain is linked with the C-terminal side of the stem region by a disulfide bond formed between Cys209 and Cys328 (Figs. 1 and 3). However, Western blot analysis using anti-spinesin A and B on the brain homogenate revealed the presence of a single major 52 kDa band that is far bigger than the predicted catalytic domain of 240 amino acid residues even if it was N-glycosylated at two sites. Whether a smaller active form of the enzyme is present at a level below the detection limit and/or uncleaved 52-kDa spinesin has enzymatic activity remains to be seen. The mechanism underlying the production of 50-kDa spinesin in the CSF and whether the enzyme has activity are also left for future studies. Immunohistochemical analysis along with Northern blot analysis showed clearly that spinesin is located in the CNS. The neuronal cells and their axons at the anterior horn of the spinal cord were clearly immunopositive. Spinesin was stained in the substantia nigra, oculomotor nucleus, and temporal lobe (data not shown). Furthermore, spinesin was demonstrated at the synapses of the spinal cord. From these results, it seems that spinesin produced in the neuronal cytoplasm may be transported along the axons to the synapses at the anterior horn of the spinal cord. We predict that spinesin is present in the presynaptic regions. As shown in Fig. 7, B and C, the oligodendrocytes were also stained. The transverse section of the spinal cord clearly demonstrated spinesin in both neuronal axons and oligodendrocytes. The physiological roles of spinesin in the synapses and oligodendrocytes could be different naturally, and further analysis is required to elucidate spinesin functions in different cell types. It should be noted here that, among TMPRSSs, only TMPRSS2 was reported to be present in the brain, having been detected at the mRNA level using human RNA master blot (8Paoloni-Giacobino A. Chen H. Peitsch M.C. Rossier C. Antonarakis S.E. Genomics. 1997; 44: 309-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar), but further examinations such as experiments on the cellular localization of the protein are needed. The proteolytic activities of membrane-anchored proteins such as membrane-type metalloproteinases and ADAM (a disintegrin-like and metalloproteinase) may play roles in activating events that take place on the cell surface. These enzymes also may interact with extracellular matrices and proteins on adjacent cells. The enzymatic activity of a few TMPRSSs has been demonstrated. Gelatin, fibrinogen, fibronectin, and laminin are cleaved by TMPRSSs (15Hooper J.D. Clements J.A. Quigley J.P. Antalis T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 857-860Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). Corin is a processing enzyme of proatrial natriuretic peptide (16Yan W., Wu, F. Morser J. Wu Q. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8525-8529Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar), and matriptase processes hepatocyte growth factor as an activator (17Lee S.-L. Dickson R.B. Lin C.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36720-36725Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). Activated spinesin mainly cleaved trypsin substrates among synthetic forms and cleaved gelatin but not casein. In summary, we have cloned spinesin/TMPRSS5, a protein that encodes 457 amino acids including a cytoplasmic domain, transmembrane domain, a scavenger receptor-like domain, and a serine protease domain, from human spinal cord mRNA. Spinesin is dominantly expressed at synapses. We predict that axonal spinesin is transported to synaptic junctions for cleavage of protein(s) in the presynaptic regions and that the spinesin dominantly expressed in some oligodendrocytes may activate or inactivate other proteins on the cell surface. We are continuing our efforts to elucidate the biological and pathophysiological functions of spinesin including identifying physiological substrates, interacting molecules, and the exact localization of the molecule in the body including CSF."
https://openalex.org/W1979449454,"WaaP of P. aeruginosa is a crucial sugar kinase that phosphorylates HepI in the inner core region of lipopolysaccharide (LPS).

In eukaryotes, protein-tyrosine kinases play important roles in biological regulation, i.e. signal transduction and growth control. Crystallography studies of protein kinases provided an insight into molecular recognition at the substrate and ATP binding sites as well as the mechanisms of action of these enzymes. At present, little is known about tyrosine kinases in prokaryotes, since they are regarded as rare and poorly defined (1Ilan O. Bloch Y. Frankel G. Ullrich H. Geider K. Rosenshine I.

Microbiol. 2000; 35: 1431-1442Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Most of these enzymes are either proposed or identified to be involved in the transportation or regulation of the production of exopolysaccharides required for virulence (1Ilan O. Bloch Y. Frankel G.

Methods Enzymol. 1991; 200: 38-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (1079) Google Scholar). Also, no protein-tyrosine kinase has been reported to date to phosphorylate the core lipopolysaccharide of Gram-negative bacteria. phosphotyrosine kinase lipopolysaccharide heptose I enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time-of-flight bovine serum albumin monoclonal antibody phosphate-buffered saline hydrofluoric acid minimum inhibitory concentration phosphotyrosine kinase lipopolysaccharide heptose I enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time-of-flight bovine serum albumin monoclonal antibody phosphate-buffered saline hydrofluoric acid minimum inhibitory concentration Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an opportunistic pathogen that can cause life-threatening infections in compromised patients including those with burn wounds or cystic fibrosis and individuals receiving chemotherapy (11Bodey G.P. Fainstein V. Garcia I. Rosenbaum B. Wong Y. J. Infect. Dis. 1983; 148: 892-897Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) located in the outer membrane of P. aeruginosa is one of the major virulent factors. It is composed of lipid A, core oligosaccharide (including inner core and outer core regions), and O-antigen (Fig. 1). The inner core LPS is composed ofl-glycero-d-manno-heptose and 3-deoxy-d-manno-octulosonic acid. LPS of P. aeruginosa is known to be the most highly phosphorylated among Gram-negative bacteria (12Wilkinson S.G. Rev. Infect. Dis. Suppl. 1983; 5: S941-S949Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Sadovskaya I. Brisson J.R. Lam J.S. Richards J.C. Altman E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 255: 673-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The multiple phosphoryl substituents in this region are essential for the outer membrane stability (14Walsh A.G. Matewish M.J. Burrows L.L. Monteiro M.A. Perry M.B. Lam J.S. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 35: 718-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Its inner core possesses three phosphate groups located on C-2, C-4, and C-6 of HepI (Fig.1), respectively. These phosphate substituents contribute negative charges that are crucial in forming ionic bridges with divalent cations to stabilize the outer membrane. The involvement of waaP in the phosphorylation of HepI ofP. aeruginosa LPS has been investigated at the genetic and LPS structural levels by our laboratory (14Walsh A.G. Matewish M.J. Burrows L.L. Monteiro M.A. Perry M.B. Lam J.S. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 35: 718-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Mutation of this gene is lethal to the bacterium, and the knockout of the chromosomalwaaP gene was accomplished only when another copy ofwaaP was added in trans (14Walsh A.G. Matewish M.J. Burrows L.L. Monteiro M.A. Perry M.B. Lam J.S. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 35: 718-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), indicating that the presence of phosphate(s) on HepI is essential for the viability ofP. aeruginosa. Furthermore,waaP P. aeruginosa (waaP Pa) can complement a Salmonella typhimurium waaP mutant and restore resistance to SDS and novobiocin in this mutant. By performing two-dimensional 1H/31P NMR analysis, our group also demonstrated that waaP Pa can reconstitute the phosphate on C-4 of HepI. These data enabled us to conclude thatwaaP encodes a sugar kinase to phosphorylate C-4 on HepI (14Walsh A.G. Matewish M.J. Burrows L.L. Monteiro M.A. Perry M.B. Lam J.S. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 35: 718-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Importantly, since WaaP is crucial to P. aeruginosa, inhibitors of the kinase function may have therapeutic value. Therefore, this protein is an attractive target for the development of novel drugs to control infection by P. aeruginosa, which is intrinsically resistant to a wide range of antibiotics. This requires an in depth understanding of the biochemical properties of this enzyme and development of an assay that can be automated for screening large numbers of potential inhibitors. WaaP of E. coli (WaaPEc) shares 52% homology with WaaPPa. The kinase activity of WaaPEc was determined by an assay using [33P]ATP to phosphorylate the LPS from thewaaP knockout mutant of E. coli (15Yethon J.A. Whitfield C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5498-5504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In that study, the authors focused on the purification of the enzyme and characterization of the enzyme kinetics. However, ak cat value was not obtained, and there were no data to link WaaPEc to the family of tyrosine kinases. In this paper, we report the overexpression and purification of WaaP and also provide evidence to show that this protein is a eukaryotic-type protein tyrosine kinase. We also developed an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) based method for measuring the activity of WaaP in phosphorylating HepI in the LPS core ofP. aeruginosa strain PAO1. Amino acid sequence of WaaP was aligned with the protein kinases in the subdomains stated in the nomenclature of Hanks and Quinn (10Hanks S.K. Quinn A.M. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 200: 38-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (1079) Google Scholar). The alignment of WaaPPa and WaaPEc was accomplished by using the Basic Local Alignment Searching Tool (BLAST) and the nonredundant GenBankTM CDS data base (16Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (59441) Google Scholar). waaP was amplified by PCR from pCOREc1 (17de Kievit T.R. Dasgupta T. Schweizer H. Lam J.S. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 16: 565-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) with the flanking forward and reverse primers 5′-ATAATAGGATCCATGAGGCTGGTGCTGG-3′ and 5′-TATATTAAGCTTCAGAGCAGGTCTCCG-3′ containing BamHI andHindIII, respectively. The PCR product was cloned into pUCP26 (18West S.E. Schweizer H.P. Dall C. Sample A.K. Runyen-Janecky L.J. Gene (Amst.). 1994; 48: 81-86Crossref Scopus (495) Google Scholar) as a positive control for complementation assay. Mutations of waaP were constructed by the method of “overlapping extension” as described by Horton (19Horton R.M. Mol. Biotechnol. 1995; 3: 93-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar) using PCR with the flanking primers as well as the primers shown below. The K69A mutation was introduced into the gene with the primer 5′-GCTCACCGCCGCGCTCCCGGTG-3′; K69R was introduced with 5′-GCTCACCGCCAGGCTCCCGGTGCTCGGC-3′; D163A was in- troduced with 5′-CAACCATCGCGCCTGCTACATCTGTC-3′; and D163E was introduced with 5′-CAACCATCGCGAGTGCTACATCTGTC-3′. The underlined nucleotides indicate the mutations. The PCR products were then cloned into pUCP26 at BamHI and HindIII sites, respectively, and transformed into E. coli F470waaP − (20Yethon J.A. Heinrichs D.E. Monteiro M.A. Perry M.B. Whitfield C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26310-26316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Constructs containing the mutations of waaP were confirmed by nucleotide sequencing (performed at the Laboratory Services Division, University of Guelph, Ontario, Canada). In vivo complementation was tested by assessing the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of SDS and novobiocin, respectively, ac- cording to Walsh et al. (14Walsh A.G. Matewish M.J. Burrows L.L.

Chem. 2001; 276: 5498-5504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) was used as the negative control. waaPwas amplified by PCR using pCOREc1, as the template, which contains the core gene cluster of P. aeruginosa (14Walsh A.G. Matewish M.J. Burrows L.L. Monteiro M.A. Perry M.B. Lam J.S. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 35: 718-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The forward and reverse primers were 5′-TATATATCATATGAGGCTGGTGCTGG-3′ and 5′-TATATAAGCTTAGAGAGCAGGTCTCCG-3′, containingNdeI and HindIII restriction endonuclease sites, respectively. The reverse primer also contains the mutation (underlined) to change the stop codon of waaP from TGA to TCT. This PCR product was cloned into pET30a expression vector (Novagen, Madison, WI) at NdeI and HindIII sites to be in frame with the His6 tag at the C terminus of the protein. The construct was then introduced into E. coliJM109 by CaCl2 transformation (21Huff J.P. Grant B.J. Penning C.A. Sullivan K.F. BioTechniques. 1990; 9: 570-572PubMed Google Scholar), and the transformants were selected on Luria agar (Fisher) containing 30 mg/liter kanamycin. Both strands of DNA were sequenced to verify the sequence of the clonedwaaP and the in frame His6 tag. The resultant construct waaP was overexpressed in E. coliBL21(DE3)pLysS (Novagen). All of the chemicals used in this paper were from Sigma unless stated. Terrific broth (22Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, New York1989: A2Google Scholar) supplemented with 3 mg/liter kanamycin and 3.4 mg/liter chloramphenicol was used for the overexpression of WaaP. The cells were first cultivated with shaking at 37 °C to 0.6 atA 600. The overexpression of recombinant protein was induced with 1 mmisopropyl-β-O-thiogalactopyranoside for 3.5 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 5000 × g and pellets were frozen at −20 °C. pET30a/E. coliBL21(DE3)plysS (Novagen) was used as the control for comparison with the overexpression of WaaP. Two grams of frozen cell pellet was suspended in 20 ml Tris buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, 0.5m NaCl, pH 8.0) containing 5 mm imidazole and 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol. A protease inhibitor mixture of 20 μl that contains 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride, bestatin, pepstatin A,trans-epoxysuccinyl-l-leucylamido(4-guanidino)butane (E-64), andN-(α-rhamnopyranosyloxyhydroxyphosphiny)-Leu-Trp(phosphoramidon) was added. Cells were broken by sonication on ice with a macroprobe at a power setting of 4 for 2 min (Ultrasonic Processor XL 2020; MANDEL Scientific Company Ltd., Guelph, Ontario, Canada) followed by centrifugation at 10,000 × g at 4 °C for 20 min. The supernatant containing the soluble WaaP protein was mixed with 3 ml of cobalt-based immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography (IMAC) resin (TALON metal affinity resin; CLONTECH Laboratories, Palo Alto, CA) and incubated at 4 °C for 1 h with gentle shaking. Then the mixture was loaded onto a 1.6-cm diameter column and washed with 20 bed volumes of 5 mmimidazole/Tris buffer. The column was further washed with 10 bed volumes of 50 mm imidazole/Tris buffer, and WaaP was eluted with 1 m imidazole/Tris buffer. The eluted protein was dialyzed extensively at 4 °C against 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, using dialysis tubing with a 3500 molecular weight cut-off (Spectrum Laboratories, Inc., Rancho Dominguez, CA), and concentrated with polyethylene glycol 8000. Protein concentration was determined by the BCA method (23Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H. Provenzano M.D. Fujimoto E.K. Goeke N.M. Olson B.J. Klenk D.C. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (18512) Google Scholar) following the procedure described by the manufacturer (Pierce). Bovine serum albumin (BSA) was used as the standard. Purified WaaP protein was analyzed by a standard discontinuous SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis method using 12.5% resolving gels (24Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206631) Google Scholar) and stained with Coomassie Blue R-250. SeeBlueTM prestained standards (NOVEX, Scarborough, Ontario, Canada) were used as the molecular weight marker. Western immunoblotting following SDS-PAGE was performed using nitrocellulose membrane according to Burnette (25Burnette W.N. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 112: 195-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (5889) Google Scholar) using Penta-HisTM antibody (Qiagen, Mississauga, Ontario, Canada) diluted to 1:1000 in 3% BSA/Tris-buffered saline (according to the manufacturer's instructions (Qiagen)) as the primary antibody. Alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-mouse F(ab′)2(Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratory, Mississauga, Ontario, Canada), diluted at 1:2000 in 3% BSA/Tris-buffered saline, was used as the secondary antibody. For the Western immunoblotting to detect phosphotyrosine, anti-phosphotyrosine PY20 antibody (1:3000 diluted in 3% BSA) (Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY) was used as the primary antibody. IMAC purified WaaP was digested with proteases including trypsin and chymotrypsin (sequence grade; Roche Molecular Biochemicals), separately, at 10 μg of protein/μg of protease in a 20-μl solution by incubating at 30 °C for 24 h. After mixing with trifluoroacetic acid and guanidine hydrochloric acid to a final concentration of 1% and 2 m, respectively, the digested peptides were loaded onto a ZipTipC18 pipette tip (bed volume was 0.6 μl) (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA) that was prewetted with 50% acetonitrile and equilibrated with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid for purification. Then the ZipTipC18 was washed with 20 bed volumes of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Finally, the purified peptides were eluted with 5 μl of 50% acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, and 0.5 μl was used for MALDI-TOF analysis. MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry was performed locally with a Bruker-Relex (Bruker-Franzen Analytik, Bremen, Germany) in reflector configuration at an acceleration voltage of 20 kV and delayed ion extraction. Mass spectrum was recorded in the negative ion mode. For determination of the molecular mass of WaaP, cytochrome c and carbonic anhydrase were used as standards to calibrate the molecular mass. The phosphorylated tyrosine residues in WaaP were identified by comparing the actual mass of the individual peptides (from MALDI-TOF analysis) with the predicted mass of the corresponding peptides that were obtained from the on-line analysis tool “Peptide Mass” program. in opaque, high binding, 96-well microtiter plates (Corning), 5 μg of purified WaaP in 100 μl of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, were precoated in each well by incubating at 37 °C for 3 h. Then the wells were washed with 200 μl of washing buffer (100 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20 in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5) five times for 10 s each and blocked with blocking buffer (1% BSA, 100 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20 in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5) by incubating at 37 °C for 1 h. The plates were washed again as above. Self-phosphorylation of WaaP was performed in a 100-μl solution in the microtiter plate well. The reactions were started by adding ATP mixture containing 250 μm ATP, 10 mmdithiothreitol, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mmMnCl2 in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. The reactions were stopped by washing the wells and blocked again as described above. After another washing step, 100 μl of monoclonal antibody (mAb) PY20 (anti-phosphotyrosine antibody) diluted 1:3000 in blocking buffer was added to the well as the primary antibody and incubated at 37 °C for 2 h. Then the wells were washed again, and 100 μl of alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-mouse F(ab′)2 (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratory), diluted at 1:2000 in blocking buffer, was added as the secondary antibody and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. After another washing step, the ELISA was developed by adding 100 μl of chemiluminescence substrate CDP-Star® Ready-to-Use with Emerald-II™ (CDP*) (Applied Biosystems, Bedford, MA), diluted 1:5 (v/v) in diethanolamine buffer (9.6% (v/v) and 0.01% (w/v), MgCl2, pH 9.8). After incubating at room temperature for 20 min, the level of chemiluminescence was measured on a 1420-VICTOR2 Multilabel Counter (Wallac, Montreal, Quebec, Canada). For determining unequivocally that phosphorylation in WaaP involved the phosphotyrosine residues, WaaP was bound on cobalt-based IMAC column, dephosphorylated in situ in the column with 10 units of protein-tyrosine phosphatase (CEDARLANE Laboratories, Hornby, Ontario, Canada) over 1 h at 30 °C, eluted with 1 mimidazole in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, and dialyzed against 100 column volumes of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8. A comparison of the phosphate contents of the dephosphorylated WaaP and untreated WaaP was made by the chemiluminescence-based ELISA as described above. For self-phosphorylation reactions using additional WaaP in solution, 5 μg of IMAC-purified WaaP and the ATP mixture were added to each well that was precoated with WaaP and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h before proceeding with the chemiluminescence detection as described above. For determining protein kinase activity of WaaP on exogenous tyrosine-containing substrate, 10 μg of poly(Glu, Tyr) 4:1 (Sigma) in 100 μl of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, was coated on the opaque 96-well microtiter plate as described above by incubating at 37 °C for 3 h. Then the plates were washed and blocked with the same washing and blocking buffers as described above. The kinase reactions were performed in a 100-μl solution including 5 μg of IMAC-purified WaaP, 250 μm ATP, 10 mmdithiothreitol, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mmMnCl2 in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. After incubating at 37 °C for 1 h, the reactions were stopped by washing the plates followed by blocking the wells again. Then ELISA was performed and developed as described above. P. aeruginosaPAO1 cells were fractionated according to the method described by Morona (26Morona R. Macpherson D.F. Van Den Bosch L. Carlin N.I. Manning P.A. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 18: 209-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Cells were cultivated in 100 ml of LB broth to a density of 0.6 at A 600 and then sedimented by centrifugation at 6000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The cell pellet was resuspended in 2 ml of cold 20% sucrose in 30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, and 200 μl of lysozyme at 1 mg/ml in 100 mm EDTA was added. The mixture was incubated for 20 min on ice and centrifuged at 6000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the pellet was suspended in 6 ml of 3 mm EDTA, pH 7.3, followed by sonication for 2 min on ice with the power setting at 4 using a macroprobe. The mixture was centrifuged again at 6000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was subjected to ultracentrifugation (Ti80 rotor, Beckman Instruments, Palo Alto, CA) at 85,000 × g for 90 min at 10 °C. The supernatant was the cytoplasmic fraction. The pellet was resuspended in 2 ml of cold H2O, and an equal volume of 4% Triton X-100, 2 mm MgCl2 in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5 was added. The mixture was vortexed intermittently for 30 min at room temperature and ultracentrifuged again at 85,000 × g for 90 min at 10 °C. The supernatant was the cytoplasmic membrane fraction, and the pellet was the outer membrane fraction. The periplasmic fraction was isolated by osmotic shock using the method modified from Kessler and Safrin (27Kessler E. Safrin M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22726-22731Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells from 3 ml of P. aeruginosa culture (grown to a density of 0.6 at A 600) were sedimented, resuspended in 2 ml of 200 mm cold MgCl2 in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.4, and kept on ice for 20 min. After centrifugation at 6000 × g for 20 min, the supernatant was kept as the periplasmic fraction. Rabbit anti-WaaP antiserum was raised against purified WaaP using protocols described by our group (28Huang L McGavin M. Forsberg C.W. Lam J.S. Cheng K.J. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1990; 56: 1229-1234Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The polyclonal antibodies were purified by immunoaffinity adsorption according to the method of Olmsted (29Olmsted J.B. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 134: 467-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) with modifications. Briefly, purified WaaP was electrophoresed and transferred on to a nitrocellulose membrane. The WaaP protein band was stained with Ponceau S (0.1% Ponceau S in 5% acetic acid) and cut out. The membrane was then blocked with 5% skim milk, 0.1% Tween 20 in PBS (phosphate-buffered saline, containing 0.8% NaCl, 0.02% KH2PO4, 0.29% Na2HPO4, 0.05% KCl, pH 7.4) at 37 °C for 1 h. After three washes for 10 min each in PBS plus 0.1% Tween 20, the membrane was incubated with 4 ml of antiserum at room temperature for 4 h on a rocking platform. Then the membrane was washed three times in PBS-Tween 20 and one time with PBS and cut into small pieces. The antibody was eluted by incubating with 0.7 ml of 0.2 m HCl-glycine buffer (pH 2.2) at room temperature for 15 min. The pH of the eluate was brought up to 7 with 0.3 ml of 1 m K2HPO4, and the antibody was dialyzed against PBS at 4 °C. For Western immunoblotting, this antibody was used at a 1:500 dilution. P. aeruginosaPAO1 cells were cultivated in 300 ml of LB overnight and harvested by centrifugation at 6000 × g for 10 min. After the cells were washed two times with PBS, LPS was extracted by the standard hot water-phenol method of Westphal and Jann (30Westphal O. Jann K. Methods Carbohydr. Chem. 1965; 5: 83-91Google Scholar), lyophilized, and stored at room temperature. Wild type LPS was dephosphorylated with 48% hydrofluoric acid (HF) at 4 °C for 48 h and dialyzed extensively against H2O in the fume hood, and the HF-LPS was recovered by lyophilization (31Kondo S. Haishima Y. Hisatsune K. Carbohydr. Res. 1992; 231: 55-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Phosphate analysis was performed according to the method of Ames et al. (32Ames B.N. Dubin D.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1960; 235: 769-775Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Enzymatic phosphorylation of HF-LPS was performed in 50 μl of solution containing 100 ng of HF-LPS, 20 mm MgCl2, 50 mm dithiothreitol, 250 μm ATP in 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.8, and the reaction was started by the addition of 5 μg of enzyme (WaaP purified by IMAC). The reaction mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 30 min (15 min for kinetics experiments) and quenched by the addition of 60 μl of chloroform/ethanol (1:10) solution. The mixtures were then centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 20 min, and 100 μl of the supernatant was transferred into opaque, polystyrene, high binding, 96-well microtiter plates (Corning). The plates were then dried at room temperature overnight in the fume hood. ELISA was performed according to Bantroch et al. (33Bantroch S. Buhler T. Lam J.S. Clin. Diagn. Lab Immunol. 1994; 1: 55-62Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to detect the phosphorylated LPS using the primary antibody mAb 7-4 (inner core-specific) generated in our laboratory (34de Kievit T.R. Lam J.S. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 7129-7139Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). mAb 7-4 had been shown to specifically recognize phosphorylated LPS. 2X. Zhao and J. S. Lam, submitted for publication. The chemiluminescence-based ELISA was as described earlier under “Self-phosphorylation and Phosphorylation of Exogenous Substrate Using a Chemiluminescence-based ELISA.” PAO1-LPS was used to establish a standard curve to quantify phosphorylated LPS. Our group (14Walsh A.G. Matewish M.J. Burrows L.L. Monteiro M.A. Perry M.B. Lam J.S. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 35: 718-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) has previously provided genetic evidence to show that WaaP is a sugar (heptose) kinase. To further investigate its kinase function and compare it with other kinases including protein kinases, alignment comparisons between the amino acid sequence of WaaP and those of a number of the well characterized protein kinases from eukaryotes were performed (Fig. 2).

We show here that <i>SCR1</i> represents a unique case of a non-tRNA class III gene in which intragenic promoter elements (the TFIIIC-binding A- and B-blocks), corresponding to the D and TΨC arms of mature tRNAs, have been adapted to a structurally different small RNA without losing their transcriptional function. In fact, despite the presence of an upstream canonical TATA box, <i>SCR1</i>transcription strictly depends on the presence of functional, albeit quite unusual, A- and B-blocks and requires all the basal components of the RNA polymerase III transcription apparatus, including TFIIIC. Accordingly, TFIIIC was found to protect from DNase I digestion an 80-bp region comprising the A- and B-blocks. B-block inactivation completely compromised TFIIIC binding and transcription capacity <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>. An inactivating mutation in the A-block selectively affected TFIIIC binding to this promoter element but resulted in much more dramatic impairment of <i>in vivo</i> than <i>in vitro</i>transcription. Transcriptional competition and nucleosome disruption experiments showed that this stronger <i>in vivo</i> defect is due to a reduced ability of A-block-mutated <i>SCR1</i> to compete with other genes for TFIIIC binding and to counteract the assembly of repressive chromatin structures through TFIIIC recruitment. A kinetic analysis further revealed that facilitated RNA polymerase III recycling, far from being restricted to typical small sized class III templates, also takes place on the 522-bp-long <i>SCR1</i> gene, the longest known class III transcriptional unit."
https://openalex.org/W1989480045,"The 5′-end region of cspA mRNA contains a Cold Box sequence conserved among several cold-shock mRNAs. This region forms a stable stem-loop structure followed by an AU-rich sequence. Here we show that the Cold Box region is essential for the normal scale of cspA mRNA induction after cold shock because a deletion of the stem-loop significantly destabilizes the mRNA and reduces the cold shock-induced cspAmRNA amount by ∼50%. The AU-rich track, however, slightly destabilizes the mRNA. The integrity of the stem is essential for the stabilizing function, whereas that of the loop sequence is less important. Overexpression of a mutant cspA mRNA devoid of both the AUG initiation codon and the coding sequence results in a severe growth inhibition at low temperature along with a derepression of the chromosomal cspA expression. Furthermore, the overexpressed RNA is stably associated with the 30 S and 70 S ribosomes. Our results demonstrate that the AUG initiation codon and the coding region containing the downstream box are not required for cspA mRNA to bind ribosomes and that the 5′-untranslated region by itself has a remarkable affinity to ribosomes at low temperature.

The major cold-shock protein of Escherichia coli, CspA, is dramatically induced upon an abrupt temperature downshift (1Goldstein J. Pollitt N.S. Inouye M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 283-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar), with its abundance reaching approximately 1 million molecules/cell (2Yamanaka K. Inouye M. Genes Cells. 2001; 6: 279-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 3Brandi A. Spurio R. Gualerzi C.O. Pon C.L. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1653-1659Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). CspA induction is also triggered by certain antibiotics (4Van Bogelen R.A. Neidhardt F.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5589-5593Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar) and by dilution of overnight cultures into fresh media, especially LB medium (2Yamanaka K. Inouye M. Genes Cells. 2001; 6: 279-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 3Brandi A. Spurio R. Gualerzi C.O. Pon C.L. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1653-1659Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Eight other cspA homologous genes, cspBto cspI, have been identified in the E. coligenome; thus, E. coli contains a large cspAfamily consisting of nine members (5Yamanaka K. Fang L. Inouye M. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 27: 247-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). CspA is not essential at both optimal and low temperatures (6Bae W. Jones P.G. Inouye M. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 7081-7088Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), apparently as a result of substantial functional redundancy of CspA family members. Nevertheless, a ΔcspAΔcspBΔcspEΔcspGquadruple deletion strain is cold-sensitive and shows multiple defects at low temperature; therefore, the CspA family is indispensable forE. coli to adapt to cold-shock stress (7Xia B., Ke, H. Inouye M. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 40: 179-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). The mechanism of cold-induced cspA expression has been studied extensively. It has been shown that the cspApromoter is highly active at both high and low temperatures (8Fang L. Jiang W. Bae W. Inouye M. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 23: 355-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). An AT-rich upstream-element immediately upstream of the −35 region has been implicated to contribute to the strength of thecspA promoter (9Mitta M. Fang L. Inouye M. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 26: 321-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). It has also been reported that thecspA promoter is modestly activated after cold shock (10Goldenberg D. Azar I. Oppenheim A.B. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 19: 241-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar,11Goldenberg D. Azar I. Oppenheim A.B. Brandi A. Pon C.L. Gualerzi C.O. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1997; 256: 282-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). At the posttranscriptional level, cspA mRNA is extremely unstable at 37 °C and is stabilized by >100-fold by a temperature downshift to 15 °C (8Fang L. Jiang W. Bae W. Inouye M. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 23: 355-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 10Goldenberg D. Azar I. Oppenheim A.B. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 19: 241-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). It is thus presumed that the practically absent CspA expression in mid- to late exponential phase is attributable to the extreme instability of its mRNA and that the posttranscriptional mRNA stabilization plays a major role in the induction of CspA after cold shock. Finally, cold-inducedcspA mRNA is well translated at low temperature. Perhaps the most evident feature of the cspA mRNA is its long (159-nucleotide) 5′-untranslated region (UTR) 1UTRuntranslated regionORFopen reading frameSDShine-Dalgarno (1Goldstein J. Pollitt N.S. Inouye M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 283-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). Alterations of this region profoundly affect the cspA mRNA level at 37 °C (8Fang L. Jiang W. Bae W. Inouye M. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 23: 355-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 12Fang L. Xia B. Inouye M. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1999; 176: 39-43PubMed Google Scholar). The same studies also show that the stability of the mRNA is influenced by manipulations on the 5′-UTR. There is also evidence suggesting that the 5′-UTR may have a role in regulating the transcription of the gene at 37 °C (12Fang L. Xia B. Inouye M. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1999; 176: 39-43PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, a sequence element called the “upstream box” is essential for the translation of the mRNA at both high and low temperatures, indicating that the 5′-UTR is also involved in the translation of cspA mRNA (13Yamanaka K. Mitta M. Inouye M. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 6284-6291Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). untranslated region open reading frame Shine-Dalgarno Overexpression of the cspA 5′-UTR (followed by the 3′-UTR containing the transcription terminator) causes the synthesis of CspA after cold shock, which is normally transient, to be substantially prolonged (14Jiang W. Fang L. Inouye M. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 4919-4925Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This phenomenon is termed “derepression.” In fact, overexpression of the first 25 bases is sufficient to cause the derepression of CspA expression after cold shock (14Jiang W. Fang L. Inouye M. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 4919-4925Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Within the first 25 bases of cspA mRNA, a sequence element called the “Cold Box” is identified to be conserved among cspA and several other cold-shock mRNAs (14Jiang W. Fang L. Inouye M. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 4919-4925Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Wang N. Yamanaka K. Inouye M. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 1603-1609Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Deletion of the Cold Box from the 5′-UTR abolishes its derepression activity when overexpressedin trans and also appears to cause derepression in cis (16Fang L. Hou Y. Inouye M. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 90-95Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, it is postulated that the Cold Box is the binding site for a putative factor(s) that negatively regulates cspAexpression and that overexpression of the 5′-UTR containing the Cold Box sequesters this factor so that cspA is released from the negative control and becomes consitutively expressed (16Fang L. Hou Y. Inouye M. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 90-95Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The first 25 bases of cspA mRNA mentioned above form a stable stem-loop structure followed by an AT-rich track (Fig.1 A). A stable stem-loop structure at the 5′-end of an mRNA sometimes has an effect on the transcription of the gene, either causing RNA polymerase pausing or, on the contrary, preventing transcription arrest (17Komissarova N. Kashlev M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1755-1760Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). In this study, we further investigated the role of this Cold Box region of cspA mRNA, taking it as a structural entity consisting of three parts: a helix of 6 bp, a loop of 5 bases, and an AT-rich track of 6 bases. We found that the Cold Box stabilized the mRNA and that the stem was essential for this function. When an ORF-deleted cspA mRNA was overexpressed in the cell at low temperature, it was found to stably associated with ribosomes, suggesting that the 5′-UTR of the mRNA functions as a translational enhancer that is capable of binding ribosomes even in the absence of the AUG initiation codon and the coding sequence. Strain HK01 was used for all Cold Box cis-effect experiments carried out using pBRWA-pCB09A and pMM158-pCB09Z plasmids. The strain was constructed by transducing a pcnB− mutation from AR137 (MC4100 Δ(malT-ompB) pcnB80) (18Harlocker S.L. Rampersaud A. Yang W.P. Inouye M. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 1956-1960Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) to acspA/cspG double deletion strain BX02 (JM83 ΔcspA ΔcspG) (7Xia B., Ke, H. Inouye M. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 40: 179-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar) using P1 phage. The transductants were screened for tetracycline resistance encoded by a Tn10 closely linked to the pcnB allele using LB-agar plates containing 5 μg/ml tetracycline and 20 mm sodium citrate. The acquisition of the mutation was confirmed by examining its ability to reduce the copy number of pBR322 plasmid as evidenced by agarose gel electrophoresis. Strain CL83lpp (JM83 recA lpp) (12Fang L. Xia B. Inouye M. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1999; 176: 39-43PubMed Google Scholar) was used for all experiments performed using pCBWT-pCB09T plasmids. Strain TB1 (JM83 hsdR(r k − m k +)) from New England Biolabs was used for site-directed mutagenesis. LB medium was used for all experiments except pulse labeling experiments, for which an M9-glucose medium supplemented with 19 amino acids (no methionine) was used. The final concentration of each amino acid was 50 μg/ml. All media used contained 50 μg/ml ampicillin. pBRWA was constructed by cloning the ∼1-kb EcoRI-HindIII fragment of pJJG02 (14Jiang W. Fang L. Inouye M. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 4919-4925Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) containing the full-length cspA gene into pBR322 between the same sites. The plasmid was then used as a template to construct pCB01–09A by site-directed mutagenesis following the protocol of the QuickChange Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene). pCB01Z to pCB09Z were constructed using the same primers and mutagenesis method as described above, except that plasmid pMM158 was used as a template. pMM158 contains a cspA-lacZ fusion gene and is identical to pMM67 (9Mitta M. Fang L. Inouye M. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 26: 321-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) except that it has a longer promoter with the 5′-end extended to −158. Plasmids pCBWT to pCB09T were constructed as follows. First, a DNA fragment corresponding to the 3′-UTR and the transcriptional terminator sequence of cspA was obtained by PCR using oligonucleotides HP04 (5′-CGGAATTCAGCCTGAATCTCT-3′) and HP05 (5′-CTGTCGACTTAACGGCGTTGC-3′) as primers and plasmid pJJG02 as a template. The PCR product was digested by EcoRI and cloned into pUC19 digested by EcoRI and SspI. Then, DNA fragments encompassing the cspA promoter and 5′-UTRs with different Cold Box sequences were amplified by PCR using plasmids pBRWA-pCB09A as templates and oligonucleotides HP01 (5′-CCAGGATCCCCGTAAGCAGTTGATGG-3′) and HP03 (5′-CCTGAATTCCCTAATTAAGTGTGCCTTTCGG-3′) as primers. The PCR products were digested with BamHI and EcoRI and then cloned between the same sites of the above-mentioned transcriptional terminator-containing plasmid. The sequences of the relevant regions of all plasmids were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Total cellular RNAs were extracted from cells using the hot phenol method as described previously (19Sarmientos P. Sylvester J.E. Contente S. Cashel M. Cell. 1983; 32: 1337-1346Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). The amounts of RNAs were quantified by their optical absorption at 260 nm, and their qualities were verified by agarose gel electrophoresis. Oligonucleotide APE (5′-TTTTACGATACCAGTCAT-3′), which is complementary to the coding sequence (from the fifth to the tenth codon) of cspA mRNA, was end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase and used as a primer to detect the cspA transcripts produced from plasmids pBRWA-pCB09A and pMM158-pCB09Z. Oligonucleotide APE(T) (5′-GATTACAGGCTGAATTC-3′), which is complementary to the junction of the cspA 5′-UTR and 3′-UTR in plasmids pCBWT-09T, was used to detect RNAs transcribed from these plasmids. These primers were unable to anneal to the chromosomal cspA RNAs expressed by either HK01 or CL83lpp. Primer extension reactions were performed for 1 h at 42 °C using avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase in the presence of the RNase inhibitor (both from Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Two μg of RNA was used for each reaction. Primer extension products were resolved on 6% denaturing polyacrylamide gels containing 6.5 m urea. mRNA signal quantification was carried out using a Molecular Dynamics Typhoon PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). To detect the localization of cspA mRNA in the cell, cultures (100 ml each) of cells harboring pCBWT and pCB09T were cold-shocked for 4 h and processed for sucrose gradient analysis as described previously (20Xia B. Etchegaray J.P. Inouye M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35581-35588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). After centrifugation, the gradients were fractionated into 0.5-ml fractions from which RNAs were obtained by means of phenol-chloroform (1:1) extraction and ethanol precipitation. Each RNA preparation (from 0.2 ml of each fraction) was dissolved in 20 μl of water, and 1 μl of each RNA was used in each primer extension reaction. Cells harboring pBRWA, pCB01A, 08A, and 09A were cold-shocked at 15 °C for 30 min, and then rifampicin was added to a final concentration of 200 μg/ml to stop transcription. Portions (1.5 ml) of cell cultures were taken at 0, 30, 60, and 90 min after the addition of rifampicin and subjected to RNA isolation. The amounts of cspA mRNAs were subsequently determined by primer extension followed by PhosphorImager quantification. Cells were grown in labeling medium to the exponential phase and shifted to a 15 °C water bath. Portions (1 ml) of each culture were labeled with 5 μl of [35S]methionine (EasyTag Express protein labeling mix, 10 μCi/μl; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for 5 min at 37 °C or for 15 min at 15 °C. Cells were chased by the addition of nonradioactive methionine to a final concentration of 5 mg/ml for 2 min at 37 °C or 5 min at 15 °C. Cells were washed with 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) and resuspended in 100 μl of SDS-protein sample buffer. Samples were boiled and resolved on 17.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels (10 μl/lane). Gels were dried and exposed to x-ray films. To further study the role of deletion of the Cold Box region on the expression of cspA, we first carried out a deletion analysis of the region by eliminating either the stem-loop, the AU-rich track, or both of them. Three mutant plasmids, pCB01A, pCB08A, and pCB09A, were generated by site-directed mutagenesis using pBRWA, which contains a full-length cspA gene on pBR322, as a template (Fig. 1 A). In light of the potential role of the region in the induction of the cspAgene, we examined the amount of mRNA expressed from these four plasmids in an engineered E. coli strain, HK01, which is devoid of chromosomal cspA gene (as well as thecspG gene) and the pcnB gene encoding for a poly(A) polymerase (see “Experimental Procedures” for details). Besause of the cspA deletion, the strain allows examination of plasmid-derived cspA mRNA without interference from the gene on the chromosome. Besides, the strain maintains pBR322-based plasmids at a very low copy number as a result of thepcnB mutation (21Lopilato J. Bortner S. Beckwith J. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1986; 205: 285-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar), which minimizes the multicopy effect of plasmid-based experimentations. HK01 cells transformed with the above-mentioned four plasmids were grown to the mid-exponential phase and subjected to cold-shock stress. After 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 h of cold shock, total cellular RNAs were extracted, and the amounts of cspA mRNAs were examined by primer extension analysis. Our previous hypothesis predicts that the deletion of the Cold Box results in prolonged and presumably increased expression of cspA mRNA. However, to our surprise, we found that the amount of the stem-loop deletion mutant mRNA (pCB01A) was ∼50% lower than that of the wild-type mRNA (pCBWA) at 1 h after cold shock (Fig. 1 B). A deletion of the AU-rich track (pCB08A) resulted in a slightly higher amount of mRNA upon cold shock, whereas a further deletion of the stem-loop (pCB09A) again caused an ∼40% reduction of the mRNA amount at 1 h after cold shock (Fig. 1 B). These results suggest that the stem-loop has an important role in regulating the cold-shock induction of cspA mRNA. Besides, the mRNAs expressed from all the above-mentioned plasmids were effectively reduced after 2 h of cold shock (Fig. 1 B), indicating that the deletion of the Cold Box failed to cause any derepression at the level of the mRNA amount in cis under this condition. We reasoned that the decrease of the mRNA amount as a result of stem-loop deletion was caused by either a lower transcription activity or a destabilization of the mutant mRNAs. Because mRNA stability plays a major role in the regulation ofcspA expression, we examined the effect of the deletions on the stabilities of the mutant mRNAs. As shown in Fig.2 A, the wild-typecspA mRNA expressed from pBRWA was highly stable at 30 min after cold shock and had a half-life of ∼60 min, whereas the stem-loop deletion mutant mRNA (pCB01A) was substantially destabilized, and its half-life was reduced to <30 min (Fig.2 B). pCB08A mRNA, with a deletion of the AU stretch, was even more stable than the wild-type with a half-life of ∼90 min, whereas further deletion of the stem-loop again caused destabilization of the pCB09A mRNA, reducing its half-life to slightly more than 30 min (Fig. 2, A and B). Note that deletion of the AU-rich region consistently stabilizes the mRNA to a certain extent (compare pCB08A and pCBWA or pCB01A and pCB09A). The region might be a potential cleavage site for a certain ribonuclease such as RNase E, which recognizes AU-rich sequences. It should be also noted that the extreme stability of cspAmRNA immediately after cold shock is transient and is progressively lost after cells become adapted to low temperature (10Goldenberg D. Azar I. Oppenheim A.B. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 19: 241-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). At 2 h after cold shock, all four of these mRNAs became much more unstable as compared with 30 min after cold shock: the half lives of pCBWA, pCB01A, and pCB09A mRNAs became ∼10 min, and that of pCB08A mRNA was slightly longer (data not shown). This is likely due to a recovery of certain nuclease activity after its initial cold-induced inactivation or an induction of cold shock-inducible nuclease activities such as polynucleotide phosphorylase, which has been proposed to be responsible for degrading cold-shock mRNAs after adaptation (22Yamanaka K. Inouye M. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 2808-2816Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). CspA is an RNA chaperone and also negatively regulates its own gene expression, thus it may also participate in the regulation of the stability of its own mRNA. It appeared that the 5′-end stem-loop structure is important for the stability ofcspA mRNA, which directly influences its induction/accumulation after cold shock. We further dissected the structure by making more mutations on this region. Six different mutations were generated on the structure, three on the stem and three on the loop, by site-directed mutagenesis (Fig.3 A). Then the amounts of thecspA mRNAs expressed from the above-mentioned mutant plasmids were examined by primer extension analysis. Quantification of the radioactive signals showed that all three mutations on the stem reduced the mRNA amount by 50–60% and that mutations on the loop either showed little effect (pCB05A) or reduced the mRNA amounts by ∼30% (pCB06A and pCB07A, Fig. 3 B). All the mutantcspA mRNAs were again found to be efficiently degraded after 3 h of cold shock, and no significant derepression effect was observed (Fig. 3 B). Because CspA regulates its own gene expression and may act on the Cold Box region (6Bae W. Jones P.G. Inouye M. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 7081-7088Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 14Jiang W. Fang L. Inouye M. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 4919-4925Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Fang L. Hou Y. Inouye M. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 90-95Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), results obtained from mutations on the cspA gene may have been affected by its own gene product. Therefore, we next attempted to confirm the results presented above by examining the expression of a reporter gene in the absence of CspA. For this purpose, we constructed the same Cold Box region mutations as shown in Fig. 1 on acspA-lacZ fusion construct, pMM158, in which thelacZ is fused after the thirteenth codon of the wild-typecspA gene on the plasmid. The fusion gene contains the entire cspA promoter together with the 5′-UTR and shows cold shock-inducible β-galactosidase activity. We then measured the amounts of mRNAs produced from these mutants and the wild-type fusion gene by primer extension. It was found that, consistent with the result obtained by mutational analysis on the authentic cspAgene (Fig. 1), deletion of either the stem-loop alone or the stem-loop plus the AU track reduced the cold-shock induction of the mRNA by ∼50%, whereas deletion of the AU-rich sequence alone did not show any significant effect (Fig. 4). It is thus assumed that the decrease of mRNA amount as a result of Cold Box deletion was again due primarily to the destabilization of the mRNA. Both the wild-type and the mutant mRNAs appeared to be derepressed to a certain extent, presumably because of the lack of CspA, a negative regulator of its own gene, in those cells. β-Galactosidase activities of the constructs were also measured and found to correlate well with their mRNA amounts (data not shown), indicating that the Cold Box does not play a significant role in the translation of cspA mRNA. It has been shown that overexpression in trans of the Cold Box-containing 5′-UTR of cspA mRNA results in derepression of the chromosomal cspA gene (14Jiang W. Fang L. Inouye M. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 4919-4925Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Fang L. Hou Y. Inouye M. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 90-95Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). From the above-mentioned observation, it is speculated that the Cold Box is a binding site for a putative repressor that turns off the gene after the acclimation phase and that upon its overexpression it sequesters the repressor and therefore derepresses the chromosomal cspA gene. However, our results presented in this study seem to contradict this speculation. As a result, we attempted to confirm the previous finding by performing similar overexpression experiments and examining the effect on CspA production from the chromosome. The plasmid used in this study to overproduce the wild-type cspA 5′-UTR, pCBWT, contained a cspA sequence with its Shine-Dalgarno (SD) sequence and its open reading frame (together from +144 to +363) deleted (Fig. 5 A). The remaining 5′-UTR was connected to the 3′-UTR by an EcoRI site and two G residues derived from vector pUC19. As shown in Fig. 5 B, the protein synthesis of cells carrying the control pUC19 plasmid dropped temporarily after cold shock (1 h,lane 2) and soon recovered (3 and 5 h, lanes 3 and 4, respectively), representing a typical cold-shock response and adaptation pattern. When a Cold Box-containingcspA mRNA lacking the coding region was overexpressed from pCBWT, the expression of the CspA family cold-shock proteins was indeed derepressed because CspA and its homologues were still expressed at 5 h after cold shock (Fig. 5 B, lane 8). More interestingly, overall cellular protein synthesis was almost completely blocked, and even the expression of cold-shock proteins was significantly reduced (compare lane 6 with lane 2). A total of nine mutations identical to those previously shown (Figs. 1and 3) were constructed based on pCBWT to examine the effect of the Cold Box in the overexpression system. When the entire Cold Box region is deleted (pCB09T; Fig. 5 B, lanes 9–12), the protein synthesis pattern after cold shock became similar to that of pUC19 (lanes 1–4). Mutations of the stem (represented by pCB04T; Fig. 5 B, lanes 13–16) also restored cellular protein production to the normal level. In contrast, mutations of the loop sequence (represented by pCB07T; Fig. 5 B, lanes 17–20) failed to abolish the inhibition of protein synthesis. Other mutations on the stem (pCB02T and pCB03T) and mutations on the loop (pCB05T and pCB06T) showed practically the same protein production pattern as that of pCB04T (data not shown). These findings, consistent with the results obtained from mutation on both cspA andcspA-lacZ fusion genes, again demonstrate that the stem of the Cold Box is essential for its function, but the loop sequence is not. Note that pCB07T, for unknown reasons, showed a somewhat stronger inhibitory effect on protein synthesis after 3 h of cold shock, and even the synthesis of CspA was largely blocked (Fig. 5 B, compare lanes 18–20 and lanes 6–8). As observed above, overexpression ofcspA mRNA lacking the coding sequence led to severe block of cellular protein synthesis. When the growth rates of cold-shocked cells harboring the above-mentioned plasmids were monitored, the plasmids expressing RNAs with the wild-type stem-loop structure were found to cause complete growth inhibition at low temperature (pCBWT and pCB08T; Fig.6 A). On the other hand, deletion of the stem-loop (pCB01T and pCB09T) restored cell growth. Again consistent with the pulse labeling results (Fig. 5), mutations on the stem (pCB02T, pCB03T, and pCB04T) also largely abolished the inhibitory activity, whereas the loop mutants (pCB05T, pCB06T, and pCB07T) still retained a strong growth-inhibitory effect (Fig.6 A). Next, we measured the amounts of RNAs expressed from the different plasmids after cold shock by primer extension. It was found that cells harboring pCBWT (Fig. 6 B, lanes 1–3) produced a large amount of plasmid-derived RNA, and notably, even at 7 h after cold shock, this RNA level was largely sustained (lane 3). In the case of pCB01T (Fig. 6 B, lanes 4–6), in which the stem-loop of the Cold Box was deleted, the accumulation of their RNAs after cold shock was markedly reduced and also effectively repressed after initial induction. Deletion of the 6-base AU-rich sequence downstream of the stem-loop (Fig. 6 B, pCB08T (lanes 7–9) and pCB09T (lanes 10–12)) caused the RNAs to be even slightly more sustainable than their counterparts, the pCBWT and pCB01T RNAs (Fig. 6 B, compare lanes 9 and 3, lanes 11 and 5, and lanes 12 and6). pCB02T (Fig. 6 C, lanes 4–6) and pCB03T (Fig.6 C, lanes 7–9), which bear mutations on the stem, had an effect similar to that of pCB09T, whereas the loop mutants pCB05T and pCB06T (Fig. 6 C, lanes 10–12 and lanes 13–15,respectively) behaved in a manner similar to that of the wild-type, pCBWT (Fig. 6 C, lanes 1–3). These results support the conclusion that the stem of the Cold Box region has a more important function than the loop for the induction of cspA mRNA after cold shock. The significant reduction and effective repression of the amounts of RNAs produced from the stem-loop deletion and the stem sequence mutants as compared with the wild-type also strongly indicate that the stem-loop of the Cold Box effectively stabilizescspA mRNA. To elucidate the mechanism by which overexpression of the ORF-lesscspA mRNAs leads to growth inhibition, we studied the cellular localization of these RNAs. Cells containing pCBWT and pCB09T were collected 4 h after cold shock and lysed by rounds of freeze-thaw in the presence of lysozyme. Cell lysates were separated by sucrose gradient centrifugation and fractionated. RNAs were extracted from the fractions, and the plasmid-derived cspA RNAs were detected by primer extension. Strikingly, primer extension analysis showed that the vast majority of the pCBWT RNA, although lacking both the SD and coding sequences, cofractionated with either the 30 S or 70 S ribosomes (Fig.7 A), indicating that the RNA was stably associated with these ribosomes. In the case of pCB09T RNA, which lacked the Cold Box, the total amount was evidently smaller than that of pCBWT RNA (compare the bottom panels of Fig. 7,B and A). Interestingly, this RNA still cofractionated with the 30 S and 70 S ribosomes, although a smaller fraction of its total amount was associated with the 70 S ribosome compared with pCBWT RNA. Both RNAs also seemed to be associated with a smaller complex(es) migrating more slowly than the 30 S subunit because their major peaks (Fig. 7 B, right side) were substantially broader than the 30 S peak and diffused toward lower molecular weight fractions. We speculate that these are partially assembled (or partially disassembled) 30 S subunits. In this study, we demonstrate that the Cold Box stabilizescspA mRNA during the acclimation phase initially after cold shock (Fig. 2). Consistent with previous observations, we found that overexpression of the 5′-UTR of cspA mRNA in trans resulted in the derepression of chromosomal CspA synthesis after cold shock (Fig. 5). It should be emphasized that overexpression of the wild-type 5′-UTR, while causing the derepression of CspA synthesis, also resulted in severe inhibition of cell growth (pCBWT; Fig. 6 A). The growth inhibition was probably at the level of translation because little [35S]methionine incorporation was detected by a pulse labeling experiment (pCBWT; Fig.5 B). The overproduced ORF-less cspA mRNA appears to sequester a factor(s) essential for cell growth or protein synthesis rather than a regulatory factor for cspAtranscription as previously speculated (16Fang L. Hou Y. Inouye M. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 90-95Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We showed that the 30 S and 70 S ribosomes were among the factors bound and potentially sequestered by the overexpressed pCBWT RNA (Fig. 7). The stable, unproductive binding of ribosomes by a large amount of highly persistent pCBWT RNA is assumed to lead to a prolonged translational block, and the derepressed production of CspA, a cold-shock RNA chaperone thought to enhance translation, is then likely to be a compensatory response of E. coli cells aimed at counteracting the translation inhibition. This is highly reminiscent of the observation that certain ribosome-targeting antibiotics, such as chloramphenicol, can induce the expression of cspA (4Van Bogelen R.A. Neidhardt F.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5589-5593Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar, 23Jiang W. Jones P. Inouye M. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 5824-5828Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and also resembles the induction of cold-shock proteins after a temperature downshift, which is considered to lead mainly to a translational block as a result of potential ribosome defects as well as the stabilization of mRNA secondary structures. The mechanism of the CspA derepression may be a stabilization of the chromosomal cspA transcripts under the growth inhibition condition, similar to that of the cold-shock induction of CspA. To this end, we have evidence that the chromosomal cspA mRNA is stabilized 3- to 4-fold when cell growth is inhibited at low temperature by a plasmid practically identical to pCBWT (data not shown). Contrary to our previous observation that deletion of the Cold Box led to derepression of cspA expression from the same gene, it was found that under the conditions used in the present study that the Cold Box had no such effect because the mutant cspAmRNAs with the Cold Box deleted were effectively cleared after 2–3 h of cold shock (Figs. 1, 3, and 6). Furthermore, we were unable to reproduce the previous in cis result. Taken together, our present results suggest that the Cold Box behaves mainly as an mRNA stabilizer, although its possible effect on transcription cannot be completely ruled out due primarily to the difficulty in directly measuring transcription activity in vivo. With regard to the observation that a deletion of the Cold Box in the overexpression system largely abolished both chromosomalcspA derepression and cell growth inhibition at low temperature (Figs. 5 and 6), we consider the loss of growth inhibition as the primary outcome and the derepression as a secondary one. It is conceivable that the Cold Box deletion destabilizes the RNA induced after cold shock, leads to a sharp reduction of its amount, and therefore effectively alleviates ribosome trapping, although the mutant RNA was still capable of ribosome binding (Fig. 7 B). Because all the overexpression results can be explained by mRNA stability and ribosome sequestration, it becomes less likely that the Cold Box is a binding site for a putative factor negatively regulating the transcription of cspA. The next question is why the pCBWT RNA, which lacks both the SD and the coding sequences, is able to interact with ribosomes. A closer examination revealed that although the original cspA SD sequence was deleted, an alternative one (GGA) was formed by the newly created EcoRI sequence in conjunction with its immediate upstream sequence (Fig. 5 A). It should also be pointed out that this new SD sequence is located at roughly the same position relative to the upstream cspA 5′-UTR sequence. It appears that this new SD sequence, albeit weaker than the authentic one, and the upstream 5′-UTR sequence together can effectively bind ribosomes at low temperature. This probably explains why our early overexpression result was not reproduced by Lim et al. (24Lim J. Thomas T. Cavicchioli R. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 297: 553-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar); a different method was used in their study to construct the plasmid in such a way that the EcoRI site was not inserted for a cloning purpose. As a consequence, the resulting RNA did not contain a reconstituted SD sequence and was unable to bind ribosomes and inhibit cell growth, hence the chromosomal cspA derepression was not triggered. Taken together, these results strongly suggest that a SD-containing 5′-UTR of the cspA mRNA is capable of efficient ribosome binding at low temperature, whereas the AUG codon and the coding sequence containing the downstream box (9Mitta M. Fang L. Inouye M. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 26: 321-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) are not required for the initial interaction with ribosomes. However, the latter two elements may either potentiate the initial interaction or stabilize the binding complex at a later stage. Certainly, the AUG is essential for the initiation of protein synthesis. In an effort to identify potential Cold Box-binding proteins using a Cold Box affinity column, we isolated a number of proteins, two of which have been identified as 30 S ribosome proteins. These proteins may bind the Cold Box in the cell and protect cspA mRNA from its degradation by either a 5′→3′ exonuclease or a certain endonuclease. At the same time, significant binding or sequestration of these proteins by Cold Box overexpression is likely to impede ribosomal assembly or function, contributing to cell growth inhibition. Further identification of such proteins and characterization of their interaction with the Cold Box are currently under way in the laboratory.

DEDD2 mRNA is expressed widely in adult human tissues with highest levels in liver, kidney, and peripheral blood leukocytes. DEDD2 interacts with FLIP, but not with Fas-associated death domain (FADD) or caspase-8. Overexpression of DEDD2 induces moderate apoptosis and results in substantial sensitization to apoptosis induced by Fas (CD95/APO-1), tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL, Apo2L), or FADD. In contrast, Bax- or staurosporine-mediated cell death is not affected by expression of DEDD2. Fluorescence microscopy showed that overexpressed DEDD2 translocates to the nucleus, which is dependent on the presence of a bipartite nuclear localization signal in the DEDD2 protein. Mutagenesis studies revealed that the translocation of the DED of DEDD2 to the nucleus is essential for its pro-apoptotic activity. These findings suggest that DEDD2 is involved in the regulation of nuclear events mediated by the extrinsic apoptosis pathway.

Upon activation of death receptors such as Fas, the cytoplasmic adaptor molecule FADD interacts with the intracellular regions of the receptor proteins by homotypic binding of their DDs (1Ashkenazi A. Dixit V.M. Science. 1998; 281: 1305-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (5125) Google Scholar). Transduction of the apoptotic signal then depends on interaction of the DED in FADD with corresponding DEDs in pro-caspase-8, or pro-caspase-10, resulting in a protein complex that promotes trans-proteolysis of receptor-associated caspase pro-enzymes (2Salvesen G.S. Dixit V.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10964-10967Crossref PubMed Scopus (768) Google Scholar). The association of Fas (CD95/APO-1), FADD, and pro-caspase-8 has been termed “death-inducing signaling complex” (DISC) (3Kischkel F.C. Hellbardt S. Behrmann I. Germer M. Pawlita M. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5579-5588Crossref PubMed Scopus (1771) Google Scholar). The active caspase subunits are then released into the cytosol, where they cleave various substrates, including other caspases (e.g. caspase-3 (4Stennicke H.R. Jurgensmeier J.M. Shin H. Deveraux Q.

Finally, the late stages of apoptosis are characterized by DNA fragmentation, which can be accomplished by endonucleases, such as caspase-activated DNase (8Liu X. Zou H. Slaughter C. Wang X.

The proteins v-FLIP and c-FLIP (FLICE-inhibitory proteins) bind to the DEDs of pro-caspase-8 and -10, interfering with their activation in the DISC (10Tschopp J. Irmler M. Thome M. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1998; 10: 552-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar). This DED-mediated anti-apoptotic mechanism may be of particular importance, because overexpression of FLIP has been reported in several types of cancer (11Griffith T.S. Chin W.A. Jackson G.C. Lynch D.H. Kubin M.Z. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 2833-2840PubMed Google Scholar, 12French L.E. Tschopp J. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 190: 891-894Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). However, DED-containing proteins affect apoptotic signaling in addition to interfering with initial events of apoptosis, such as the DISC formation. In this regard, Stegh et al. (13Stegh A.H. Schickling O. Ehret A. Scaffidi C. Peterhansel C. Hofmann T.G. Grummt I. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5974-5986Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) identified a protein named DEDD (death effector domain-containing DNA-binding protein), which contains a DED and two nuclear localization signals and binds strongly to DNA. DEDD was shown to translocate from the cytosol to the nucleus after induction of apoptosis, thereby representing a possible novel mechanism for linking cytoplasmic and nuclear events during apoptosis. We now report the identification of a second nucleus-targeting, DED-containing protein, which we call DEDD2. The DEDD2 protein is a close relative of DEDD, sharing 48.5% amino acid sequence identity. DEDD2 resembles DEDD in its subcellular localization and has comparable pro-apoptotic activity but seems to differ from DEDD in its binding to other DED family members. TBLASTN searches of the human expressed sequence tag (EST) data base using the amino acid sequence of DEDD as a query resulted in the identification of two EST clones with homologous partial cDNAs. One of the clones (GenBankTMaccession number AA218681) was kindly provided by the Genome Sequencing Center (St. Louis, MO) and sequenced in its entirety, revealing an open reading frame (ORF) encoding a 326-amino acid protein with homology to DEDD, which we termed “DEDD2.” The DEDD2 sequence was submitted to GenBankTM with the accession number AF443591. The corresponding genomic sequence for this cDNA was identified in the human genome data base (clone CIT-B-147B23), which was derived from chromosome 19q13.2. Northern blot membranes containing poly(A)+ RNA from multiple tissues (MTN, CLONTECH) were hybridized with a32P-labeled DNA probe spanning the first 518 bp of the DEDD2 cDNA. Hybridization was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. For RT-PCR, we employed multiple tissue cDNA panels (CLONTECH) containing first-strand cDNA generated from eight different tissues. PCR was performed with the following primers: 5′ primer, 5′-GTGTCTCCAGAACGCT-3′; 3′ primer, 5′-AGAAGGCGTCCAGA-3′, and β-actin primers. Additionally, total RNA was isolated from different cell lines using the RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen) according to a standard protocol. The ORF encoding DEDD2 was PCR-amplified from cDNA of the EST clone AA218681 using the forward primer, 5′-CCGGAATTCACCATGGCGCTATCCGGGTCGACC-3′, and reverse primer, 5′-CCGCTCGAGTCAGGAGGCCTCTGTCGG-3′. The PCR products were digested with EcoRI and XhoI and cloned into theEcoRI and XhoI sites of pcDNA3 (Stratagene). Epitope-tagged expression plasmids were constructed by PCR using primers flanking with FLAG or HA epitope tag sequences and appropriate restriction sites. GFP-DEDD2 and DEDD2-GFP was constructed by subcloning DEDD2 into the EcoRI and SalI sites of pEGFP-C2 and pEGFP-N3 (CLONTECH), respectively. The cDNAs encoding various fragments of DEDD2 were generated by PCR from the plasmid pcDNA3-DEDD2 using the following forward (F) and reverse (R) primers containing EcoRI and XhoI restriction sites and the sequence encoding the FLAG epitope tag: N1-DEDD2, 5′-CGGAATTCACCATGGACTACAAAGACGATGACGACAAGGCGCTATCCGGGTCGACC-3′ (F) and 5′-CCGCTCGAGTCAGTGCGGCAGCAGGTCGT-3′ (R); N2-DEDD2, 5′-CGGAATTCACCATGGACTACAAAGACGATGACGACAAGGCGCTATCCGGGTCGACC-3′ (F) and 5′-CCGCTCGAGTCAGCGACGGCAGCTACCCTC-3′ (R); N3-DEDD2, 5′-CGGAATTCACCATGGACTACAAAGACGATGACGACAAGGCGCTATCCGGGTCGACC-3′ (F) and 5′-CCGCTCGAGTCATGGCCCATGCTCGCAGTA-3′ (R); C1-DEDD2, 5′-CCGGAATTCACCATGGCACCCCAGCAGCAGTCA-3′ (F) and 5′-CCGCTCGAGTCACTTGTCGTCATCGTCTTTGTAGTCGGAGGCCTCTGTCGGGCG-3′ (R); C2-DEDD2, 5′-CCGGAATTCACCATGGAGGGTAGCTGCCGTCGC-3′ (F) and 5′-CCGCTCGAGTCACTTGTCGTCATCGTCTTTGTAGTCGGAGGCCTCTGTCGGGCG-3′ (R). To generate the nuclear-targeted DEDD2 proteins, various DEDD2 fragments were subcloned into the EcoRI and XhoI sites of pcDNA3-NLS (generated by the insertion of an oligonucleotide encoding for the SV40-LargeT-like nuclear localization signal into the HindIII-EcoRI sites of pcDNA3.1) (14Knee D.A.

HEK293, COS-7, and LN-18 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Irvine Scientific) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1 mml-glutamine, and antibiotics. For transient transfection apoptosis assays, 3 × 105 cells in six-well plates (Corning) were co-transfected using LipofectAMINE Plus (Invitrogen) with 1 μg of plasmid cDNA encoding full-length DEDD2 or the respective DEDD2 fragments, and 0.2 μg of green fluorescence protein (GFP) marker plasmid pEGFP (CLONTECH). Plasmids encoding FADD and Bax were co-transfected in various amounts as indicated (total DNA = 1.7 μg). In each experiment, the total amount of DNA was normalized using pcDNA3. At various times post-transfection, both adherent and floating cells were collected, fixed, and stained with 0.1 μg/ml 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) (15Zha H. Fisk H.A. Yaffe M.P. Mahajan N. Herman B. Reed J.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6494-6508Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). The percentage of apoptotic cells was determined by counting the GFP-positive cells exhibiting nuclear condensation and/or fragmentation. For stable transfections, LN-18 human glioblastoma cells in six-well plates were transfected with pcDNA3 neo(control), or pcDNA3-DEDD2-FLAG plasmids using LipofectAMINE Plus (Invitrogen). Two days later, complete medium containing G418 (700 μg/ml) (Omega Scientific) was used to select stably transfected cells. Single clones were obtained 4–8 weeks after transfection by limiting-dilution cloning. For apoptosis assays, 5 × 103 cells per well were plated in 96-well plates, cultured for 24 h, and then incubated with anti-Fas CH11 antibody (MBL), TRAIL (Biomol), or staurosporine (Sigma Chemical Co.) for 24 h in serum-free medium. The percentage of surviving cells was assessed by staining with crystal violet. The crystal violet assay is a colorimetric technique based on the uptake of vital dye and allows rapid quantification of cell number in adherent cultures (16Gillies R.J. Didier N. Denton M. Anal. Biochem. 1986; 159: 109-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar). Briefly, the supernatant was removed, and the cells were incubated for 10 min in crystal violet solution (2%) in 20% methanol. The plates were washed in running tap water and air-dried for 24 h. After addition of 0.1m sodium citrate buffer, OD values were measured at 550 nm using a plate photometer (Bio-Tek Instruments). Alternatively, apoptotic cell death of LN-18 glioma cells was directly assessed by counting cells exhibiting nuclear condensation and/or fragmentation after staining with DAPI. For in vitro glutathioneS-transferase (GST) binding assays, the plasmid pGEX4T1-DEDD2(DED) was introduced into Escherichia colistrain XL1-Blue. GST fusion proteins were obtained by induction with 0.1 mm isopropyl β-thiogalactoside at 30 °C for 4 h and then purified using glutathione-Sepharose. Various plasmids encoding DED-containing proteins were translated in vitro in the presence of [35S]methionine using a TnT-coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega). Proteins translated in vitro were incubated with 20 μg of GST fusion proteins precoupled to beads for 6 h at 4 °C. Beads were then washed several times, and bound proteins were eluted and analyzed by 10–15% SDS-PAGE with subsequent autoradiography. HEK293T cells cultured with 50 μmbenzoyl-Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromethylketone (zVAD-fmk) (Bachem) were seeded in 10-cm dishes (106 cells per dish) and co-transfected with 2 μg of pcDNA3-DEDD2-FLAG, pcDNA3FLAG-DEDD2, or pcDNA3-DEDD-FLAG, and pcDNA3-HA-FADD, pcDNA3-myc-FLIP, or pcDNA3-HA-pro-caspase-8. Controls were transfected with pcDNA3neo only, and in each sample the total amount of DNA was normalized using pcDNA3 neo. At 24 h post-transfection, cells were collected and resuspended in lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol) containing 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). After pre-clearing with normal mouse IgG and 25 μl of Protein G-Sepharose 4B (Zymed Laboratories Inc.), soluble lysates were incubated with 20 μl of anti-FLAG antibody M2-conjugated agarose (Sigma), anti-myc antibody-conjugated agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies), or 20 μl of anti-HA antibody clone 3F10 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) in combination with Protein G-Sepharose 4B at 4 °C for 8 h. Controls included immunoprecipitations performed with an equivalent amount of normal mouse IgG in combination with Protein G-Sepharose 4B. After extensive washing with lysis buffer, immune complexes were fractionated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose for immunoblotting using monoclonal rat anti-HA (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), monoclonal mouse anti-FLAG (Sigma), or monoclonal mouse anti-myc (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies) antibodies, followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies. An enhanced chemiluminescence system (ECL, Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) was used for detection. COS-7 cells were cultured in eight-well, covered chamber slides (Nalge Nunc) (104 cells per chamber), transfected with various DEDD2 plasmids (as indicated) using LipofectAMINE Plus reagent, and incubated at 37 °C for 12, 18, or 24 h. Then, cells were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde for 20 min at room temperature. After washing with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and blocking with 1% normal goat serum, the cells were incubated with monoclonal mouse anti-FLAG M2 antibody (Sigma) or monoclonal mouse anti-nucleophosmin antibody (Zymed Laboratories Inc., clone FC-61991) for 1 h at 4 °C, washed three times with PBS, incubated with Alexa 594 goat anti-mouse IgG F(ab′)2secondary antibody (Molecular Probes) for 30 min at room temperature, and again washed three times with PBS. Subsequently, coverslips were mounted onto the slides using Mowiol (Hoechst). The cells were imaged by confocal microscopy using a Bio-Rad MRC 1024 instrument. Using the sequences of several Death Effector Domains (DEDs), the publicly available EST data bases were searched by saturated BLAST for the existence of new DED-containing proteins (17Li W. Pio F. Pawlowski K. Godzik A. Bioinformatics. 2000; 16: 1105-1110Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). This search identified two human EST clones (AW449244 and AA218681) that contained a DED with greatest sequence similarity to the DED of DEDD (13Stegh A.H. Schickling O. Ehret A. Scaffidi C. Peterhansel C. Hofmann T.G. Grummt I. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5974-5986Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). One of the clones spanned a 2.0-kb sequence that encoded an open reading frame (ORF) corresponding to a 326-amino acid protein, which we termed DEDD2. The cDNA sequence of DEDD2 was confirmed by amplifying DEDD2 cDNA from the neuronal precursor cell line NT2. The predicted ORF was initiated by an AUG start codon within a favorable Kozak context. In addition to the DED, the predicted DEDD2 protein contains two nuclear localization signals (NLS) (Fig.1 A). The first one is identical to the NLS of another protein, Amida (18Irie Y. Yamagata K.

Overall, DEDD2 shares 48.5% amino acid sequence identity and 55.3% DNA sequence identity with human DEDD (Fig. 1, B and C). The DEDD2 gene is located on chromosome 19 (map 19q13.2), as determined by in silico screening of the human genome data base at NCBI. In contrast, the DEDD gene is located on chromosome 1q. Northern blotting demonstrated the presence of DEDD2 transcripts of ∼2.0-kb length in most adult human tissues (Fig.2 A). High levels of DEDD2 mRNA were found in liver, kidney, heart, skeletal muscle, and peripheral blood leukocytes, whereas DEDD2 mRNA was absent or low in colon and small intestine. A 4.4-kb transcript was found in some tissues, and an additional, smaller 1.6-kb transcript was detected in RNA from peripheral blood leukocytes. RT-PCR assays using primers specific for DEDD2 extended and confirmed the Northern blot findings. High expression was found in peripheral blood leukocytes and ovary, whereas no expression was found in colon and small intestine (Fig.2 B, upper panel). All of the human cell lines examined were positive for DEDD2 mRNA expression (Fig.2 B, lower panel). The DEDD2 protein was tested for interaction with other DED-containing proteins by in vitro binding assays and co-immunoprecipitations. First, binding experiments were performed by incubating a GST fusion protein containing the DED of DEDD2 or a GST-control fusion protein (GST-CD40) with various 35S-labeled, in vitro-translated DED-containing proteins (Fig.3 A). Although GST-DEDD2(DED) bound to the isolated DEDs of FADD and pro-caspase-8, no interaction was detectable with the full-length proteins. In contrast, GST-DEDD2(DED) readily bound to in vitro translated full-length FLIP. DEDD2 did not associate with itself, nor with the DED (like)-containing proteins DEDD, DAP3, Bap31, PEA-15, or BAR. To confirm these findings in a more physiological setting, we performed co-immunoprecipitation experiments, wherein DEDD2, FADD, caspase-8, and FLIP were expressed in HEK293T cells with various epitope tags. In accordance with the in vitro binding assays, these studies indicated that DEDD2 binds to FLIP but not to FADD or pro-caspase-8 (Fig. 3 B, left panel). These findings were also confirmed by using either N- or C-terminal FLAG-tagged DEDD2 proteins (Fig. 3 B and not shown). As a comparison, we performed similar experiments with DEDD (Fig. 3 B, right panel). Interestingly, DEDD was capable of binding FADD and, to a lesser degree, FLIP, but not caspase-8. To assess the effects of DEDD2 on apoptosis, HEK293N cells were transiently transfected with plasmids encoding wild-type DEDD2, GFP-DEDD2, DEDD2-GFP, FLAG-DEDD2, DEDD2-FLAG, and HA-DEDD2. Ectopic expression of DEDD2 resulted in weak induction of apoptosis after 24 h, whereas at 72-h post-transfection the extent of apoptotic cell death reached a maximum with ∼20% dead cells (Fig.4 A). The percentage of cell death was similar with all constructs irrespective of the epitope tag. As a control, the cells were transfected with a plasmid encoding DEDD-FLAG, resulting in a comparable extent of apoptosis (15–20%; data not shown). Given the presence of a DED, we wondered if DEDD2 would interfere with DD/DED-related apoptosis signaling. Thus, we co-transfected HEK293N cells with FADD and DEDD2, or the empty control vector (neo). In fact, DEDD2 transfection substantially sensitized the cells to FADD-induced cell death (Fig. 4 B), whereas DEDD2 did not enhance Bax-mediated apoptosis (Fig. 4 C). To further examine DEDD2-mediated effects on apoptosis, we stably transfected the Fas- and TRAIL-sensitive human glioblastoma cell line LN-18 with a plasmid encoding DEDD2-FLAG. Treatment of these cells with anti-Fas antibody CH11 or TRAIL demonstrated increased sensitivity for death receptor-mediated apoptosis of DEDD2 transfectants as compared with control cells (Fig. 4, D, E, G,H). CH11- and TRAIL-induced effects are depicted either as the fraction of surviving cells (Fig. 4, D and E) or as the percentage of apoptotic cells as determined by DAPI staining (Fig. 4, G and H). In contrast, transfectants and control cells were equally susceptible to staurosporine-induced cell death (Fig. 4, F and I). Given the prolonged time course of DEDD2-induced cell death (Fig.4 A), we sought to confirm that DEDD2-mediated cell death is truly apoptotic cell death. COS-7 cells were transiently transfected with different DEDD2-encoding plasmids, fixed at various times after transfection, stained, and subjected to fluorescence microscopy. Fig.5 shows the typical staining pattern of cells transiently transfected with plasmids encoding FLAG-, HA-, or GFP-tagged DEDD2. DEDD2 localizes to the nuclei of cells with accumulation in nucleoli-like structures, whereas virtually no staining is detectable in the cytoplasm (Fig. 5, A and B). Depending on the elapsed time after transfection, typical morphological hallmarks of apoptosis occur, such as nuclear condensation and fragmentation (Fig. 5 C). To examine the subnuclear localization of DEDD2 in more detail, we performed co-localization studies using a monoclonal antibody specific for nucleophosmin (B23), which is an abundant nucleolar protein (19Chan P.K., Qi, Y. Amley J. Koller C.A. Cancer Lett. 1996; 100: 191-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Nucleophosmin staining co-localized with the fluorescence signal of GFP-DEDD2, confirming that these subnuclear structures are nucleoli (Fig. 5, D–F). To further examine which regions of DEDD2 are responsible for induction of cell death, we generated a series of N- and C-terminal truncation mutants of DEDD2, performed transient transfections in HEK293N cells, and screened for cell death (Fig. 6 A). Importantly, only mutants harboring the DED and the bipartite NLS retained pro-apoptotic activity. In contrast, protein fragments containing the DED only, the DED with the first NLS, or the complete C terminus (irrespective of the presence of a NLS) were non-toxic (Fig.6 A, right column). Immunoblot analysis confirmed that all DEDD2 protein fragments were produced at comparable levels, thus excluding trivial explanations for the observed differences in function (Fig. 6 B). Next, we asked how the differences in apoptotic activity of the mutants corresponded to their subcellular localization. To this end, COS-7 cells were transfected with the mutants, fixed, stained, and examined by fluorescence microscopy. Full-length DEDD2 and N3-DEDD2, which lacks the C terminus, clearly localized into the nucleus (Fig.7, A and B). C1-DEDD2, which consists of the C terminus region only, was found exclusively in the cytoplasm (Fig. 7 C), whereas C2-DEDD2 that contains the C terminus region of DEDD2 and the bipartite NLS localized exclusively to the nucleus with strong accumulation in nucleoli-like structures (Fig. 7 D). N1-DEDD2, which consists of the DED only, was found in the cytoplasm as well as in the nucleus (Fig. 7 E), and N2-DEDD, which harbors the DED and the first NLS, was found in the nucleus but also, to a lesser extent, in the cytoplasm (Fig. 7 G). Thus, the combination of the DED and the ability to target to nuclei appeared to correlate with pro-apoptotic activity. Because these results suggested that the DED is sufficient to induce apoptosis, provided that it is transported into the nucleus, we fused the DED of DEDD2 to the SV40-LargeT-like NLS and performed apoptosis assays as for the other mutants. In fact, transfection of the DED/SV40-LargeT-like-NLS mutants resulted in a similar extent of apoptosis as full-length DEDD2. These mutants (NUC-N1-DEDD2 and NUC-N2-DEDD2) localized clearly to the nucleus, resulting in a staining pattern similar to that of full-length DEDD2 (Fig. 7, F and H). Thus, the conversion of the non-toxic N1- and N2-DEDD2 mutants to pro-apoptotic proteins was achieved by adding a heterologous NLS. Multiple DED-containing proteins that modulate apoptosis have been identified (20Reed J.C. Am. J. Pathol. 2000; 157: 1415-1430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). DEDs are found in the pro-forms of the initiator caspases, caspase-8 and -10, in the adaptor protein FADD, and in FLIPs, among other proteins. Viral and cellular FLIPs inhibit Fas-induced apoptosis by interaction with the two tandem DEDs of pro-caspase-8 and by competing with pro-caspase-8 and -10 for binding to FADD. Other proteins that contain DEDs or DED-like domains are PEA-15 (21Araujo H. Danziger N. Cordier J. Glowinski J. Chneiweiss H. J. Biol.

Interestingly, it has also been suggested that DEDs are involved in cellular signaling events other than the regulation of apoptosis, such as the activation of the extracellular signal receptor-activated kinase by the DED of PEA-15 (27Ramos J.W. Hughes P.E. Renshaw M.W. Schwartz M.A. Formstecher E. Chneiweiss H. Ginsberg M.H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 2863-2872Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Thus, apart of their involvement in the initial events of death receptor-dependent apoptosis at the DISC, DED-containing proteins may also play other important roles in cellular signaling. In this regard, the identification of DEDD contributed substantially to an extended view of the possible functions of DEDs. DEDD, which contains an N-terminal DED and a C-terminal histone-like domain, is present in the cytosol but translocates to nuclei during Fas-induced apoptosis (13Stegh A.H. Schickling O. Ehret A. Scaffidi C. Peterhansel C. Hofmann T.G. Grummt I. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5974-5986Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). There, it supposedly shuts off ribosomal RNA gene transcription by repressing both RNA polymerase I and II transcription. DEDD is therefore an apoptosis-regulating protein that possibly links early and late events involved in apoptosis. Interestingly, it has also been suggested that DEDD mRNA is up-regulated after induction of apoptosis in germ cells (28Leo C.P. Hsu S.Y. McGee E.A. Salanova M. Hsueh A.J. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 4839-4848Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). We report here the identification of a new protein, DEDD2, that contains a DED and is capable of inducing apoptosis upon translocation to the nucleus. The amino acid sequence and domain structure of DEDD2 closely resembles DEDD. Like DEDD, the DEDD2 gene is widely expressed in human tissues and cell lines and is highly conserved between human and mouse (data not shown). When expressed transiently, both DEDD and DEDD2 induce apoptosis to a similar extent. Cell death induced by overexpressed DEDD2 occurs with a protracted time course, with the percentage of apoptotic cells reaching a maximum after ∼3 days. Moreover, the translocation of the DED of DEDD2 to the nucleus, most probably accomplished by the bipartite NLS2, is crucial for induction of apoptosis. These findings suggest a role for DEDD2 in late apoptotic events that affect the cell nucleus. In this regard, the apoptotic cell death program is known to affect the nuclear matrix (or scaffold), which is mainly composed of non-histone proteins and RNA. Nuclear matrix proteins are cleaved during apoptosis, thereby facilitating the breakdown of the nuclear scaffold and, finally, of the entire nucleus. These include topoisomerase IIa, NuMA, SATB1, and lamins (29Martelli A.M. Zweyer M. Ochs R.L. Tazzari P.L. Tabellini G. Narducci P. Bortul R. J. Cell. Biochem. 2001; 82: 634-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Interestingly, preliminary findings obtained by cDNA microarray analysis indicate that the expression of various scaffold proteins is decreased in cells overexpressing DEDD2. 2W. Roth and J. Reed, unpublished results. Nuclear apoptotic events also affect DNA transcription and RNA processing, the latter of which is mainly localized in the nucleolus. For example, a central regulator of rDNA transcription, upstream binding factor, is cleaved during apoptosis (30Casiano C.A. Martin S.J. Green D.R. Tan E.M. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 765-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). The striking accumulation of DEDD2 in nucleoli points to a possible interference with RNA transcription and processing, e.g. by promoting the cleavage of upstream binding factor or other nucleolar proteins. Apart from structural changes in the nucleoli, this would eventually lead to ribosomal dysfunction. Interestingly, death receptor-dependent degradation of 28 S ribosomal RNA has been shown to result in inactivation of ribosomes, which has a devastating effect on cellular homoeostasis (31Nadano D. Sato T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13967-13973Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Because the data presented here are derived from overexpression experiments, it will be crucial to study the nuclear effects of endogenous DEDD2 in more detail. Despite the similarities between DEDD and DEDD2, which indicate that these two proteins are closely related, differences also exist that suggest non-redundant mechanisms of action. In contrast to DEDD, the DEDD2 protein failed to bind FADD, and DEDD2 showed stronger binding to FLIP than DEDD. The sequence differences within the DEDs of the two proteins may explain these distinct binding properties. Furthermore, the N-terminal mutants of DEDD2 have similar pro-apoptotic activity as the full-length protein, thus, the C terminus of DEDD2 may lack the autoinhibitory function reported for the corresponding region of DEDD. Other differences become evident when the functions of the NLSs are examined. Although the NLS1 of DEDD is reported to be responsible for nucleolar targeting, the NLS1 of DEDD2 was sufficient for nuclear targeting but did not result in nucleolar accumulation. In contrast, although the NLS2 of DEDD was shown to promote nuclear but not nucleolar targeting, the bipartite NLS2 of DEDD2 resulted in strong nucleolar accumulation. These differences may be due to the sequence divergence of the two proteins. For example, the NLS2 regions of DEDD and DEDD2 are only 40.9% identical in amino acid sequence. In this report, we show that DEDD2 (as well as DEDD) has the ability to bind c-FLIP. It has been demonstrated that DEDD is not involved in the formation of the DISC (13Stegh A.H. Schickling O. Ehret A. Scaffidi C. Peterhansel C. Hofmann T.G. Grummt I. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5974-5986Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Therefore, one could speculate that DEDD and DEDD2 antagonize FLIP-mediated anti-apoptosis by sequestering FLIP to the nucleus, thus sensitizing the cell to death receptor-induced apoptosis. However, subcellular fractionation experiments revealed no substantial DEDD2-mediated relocation of FLIP to the nucleus (data not shown). DEDAF, a DEDD-binding protein, has recently been described (32Zheng L. Schickling O. Peter M.E. Lenardo M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31945-31952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). DEDAF binding to DEDD was observed in the nucleus, resulting in a change in subnuclear distribution of DEDD. It therefore will be interesting to explore the interaction of DEDD2 with this protein. Further investigation of this intriguing cell death pathway will shed light on the mechanisms responsible for linking DEDs and nuclear apoptotic events. We thank M. Peter for DEDD plasmids, H. Chneiweiss for PEA-15 plasmids, and M. Weller for the LN-18 malignant glioma cell line."

The name for the SCAN domain was derived from the first letters of the names of four proteins initially found to contain this domain (SRE-ZBP,CTfin51, AW-1 (ZNF174), and Number 18 cDNA or ZNF197) (5Williams A.J.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 2908-2914Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The SCAN domain consists of an 84-residue, leucine-rich region and is predicted to contain a high degree of α-helix. It is located at the N terminus when it is part of a zinc finger-containing transcription factor. The primary amino acid sequence of the domain does not resemble any of the other zinc finger-associated domains, such as the Kruppel-associated box (KRAB) or the poxvirus and zinc finger (POZ) domain, which is also known as the BTB (Broad-complex, Tramtrack, and Bric-a-brac) domain (7Peng H.

In part of those studies, a fragment of the N terminus of either ZNF174 or ZNF202 that encompassed the SCAN domain behaved as an oligomeric species. However, in those studies the definitive subunit stoichiometry of the oligomeric SCAN domain was not determined. Here we have utilized the sequences of the 60 SCAN domains in the human genome to more completely define the limits of the domain. We have overexpressed, purified, and characterized the isolated SCAN domain from ZNF174. Gel filtration, sedimentation equilibrium, and thermal denaturation studies demonstrate that the isolated SCAN domain forms a stable homodimer. These findings support a model in which the SCAN domain is capable of mediating the selective dimerization of a large family of vertebrate-specific, zinc finger-containing transcription factors. The DNA segment containing residues 37–132 of ZNF174 was amplified from a full-length clone of ZNF174 using polymerase chain reaction. This amplified fragment was then subcloned into the BamHI site of pGEX-2T (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). Automated dideoxynucleotide sequencing of the SCAN domain insert verified the correct orientation and authenticity of the insert. The predicted protein product consists of the SCAN domain insert fused with glutathione S-transferase (GST). The amino acid sequence of the final protein product after cleavage from GST with thrombin consists of the 96-residue sequence illustrated in Fig. 1, preceded by glycine-serine. This 98-residue protein has a calculated isoelectric point of 8.7 and a molecular mass of 11.56 kDa. Escherichia coli BL21 bacteria transformed with the pGEX-SCAN fusion construct were grown to anA 600 of 0.6 at 37 °C and then induced with 0.1 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 1–2 h. The cells were pelleted at 4000 × g for 30 min. The cells were then suspended in phosphate-buffered saline (67 mmphosphate, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm DTT, pH 7.4, or phosphate-buffered saline, 30 ml/1 liter of culture) containing 0.1% Nonidet-P40 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and Complete protease inhibitor mixture (1 tablet/50 ml, Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The cells were lysed by sonication, and the homogenate was centrifuged at 3000 × g for 30 min. Glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) was added to the resulting supernatant (0.75 ml resin/1 liter of culture). The supernatant was then agitated on a rocker for 20 min and then centrifuged at 500 × gfor 5 min. The resulting supernatant was removed, and the resin was placed in a chromatography column and washed with 2 bed volumes of phosphate-buffered saline. The resin was then incubated as a 50% slurry with thrombin (80 units/0.75 ml of resin) at 25 °C overnight. The resin was then washed with one bed volume of phosphate-buffered saline, and the eluate was diluted 1:2 with water. All subsequent steps were performed at 4 °C using a Biologic HR chromatography system (Bio-Rad). The sample was applied at 1 ml/min to an S5 cation exchange column (Bio-Rad). The column was washed with 34 mm phosphate, 75 mm NaCl, and 5 mmDTT, pH 7.4, and then the protein was eluted with a linear NaCl gradient running from 75 mm to 1 m in 34 mm phosphate, 5 mm DTT, pH 7.4. The sample was then concentrated to 0.5 ml with a Centricon YM-3 (Amicon, 3000 Da MWCO) at 3000 × g. The sample was then applied to a Bio-Prep S.E.-100/17 size exclusion chromatography column (8 × 300 mm, Bio-Rad) equilibrated in 25 mm phosphate, 200 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, pH 6.5, at a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min. Recombinant purified SCAN domain (225 μm subunit) in 25 mm phosphate, 200 mm NaCl, 1 mmDTT, pH 6.5 was applied a Bio-Sil SEC 250-5 analytical gel filtration column (Bio-Rad) at 0.7 ml/min with a back-pressure of 800 p.s.i. using a Biologic HR chromatography system (Bio-Rad). The column was calibrated under the same conditions with the following protein standards (thyroglobulin, molecular weight 670,000; IgG, 158,000; ovalbumin, 44,000; myoglobin, 17,000). The isolated SCAN domain was dialyzed overnight against 25 mm phosphate, 200 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, pH 6.5. Sedimentation equilibrium was performed at 20 °C in a Beckman XL-A Analytical Ultracentrifuge using three rotor speeds (16,000, 21,000, and 26,000 rpm) and at three different protein concentrations (5, 15, and 50 μm subunit). After samples had reached equilibrium (typically 18 h), they were scanned in triplicate at 280, 236, and 229 nm. Data were analyzed with a linear least squares fitting program (KaleidaGraph) using a partial specific volume of 0.738 calculated using WEBTools. 2Found on the Web at bmb.psu.edu/nixon/WEBTools/mwtvbar.htm. CD spectra were recorded at 4 °C on an Aviv 62DS spectropolarimeter equipped with a thermoelectric temperature controller. Samples of recombinant ZNF174-isolated SCAN domain (25 μm subunit) were prepared in 25 mmphosphate, 200 mm NaCl, 0.2 mm DTT, pH 6.5. Spectra representing the average of five scans from 260 to 195 nm were measured in a 1-mm path length cuvette, using a step size of 1 nm and a 3-s signal-averaging time. All spectra were corrected for the base line obtained with the buffer alone. Thermal denaturation was performed by monitoring the molar ellipticity at 222 nm of the SCAN domain at various temperatures. Experiments were performed with protein concentrations of 2 and 5 μm subunit in a cuvette with a 1-cm path length. Measurements were made with a 2-min equilibration time and a 2 °C step interval. The melting temperature (T m) for each protein concentration was determined from the peak position on the plot of −dΘ222 nm/d(1/T) versus T. The predicted secondary structure for the isolated SCAN domain was determined using the following on-line prediction programs: PredictProtein, PREDATOR, nnPredict, Hierarchical Neural Network, Prof, Jpred, and SSpro. 3Found on the Web, respectively, at: dodo.cpmc.columbia.edu/ predictprotein/; embl-heidelberg.de/cgi/predatorserv.pl; cmpharm.ucsf.edu/∼nomi/nnpredict.html; npsa-pbil.ibcp.fr/cgi-bin/npsaautomat.pl?page=npsann.html; aber.ac.uk/∼phiwww/prof/; jura.ebi.ac.uk: 8888/; promoter.ics.uci.edu/BRNN-PRED/. The purity of the protein was assessed by SDS-polyacrylamide electrophoresis using an XCell Surelock electrophoresis cell (Novex) and 4–12% precast gradient gels. N-terminal sequencing and matrix-assisted laser desorption mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS) of the purified SCAN domain was performed by the University of Michigan, Protein Core Facility, Ann Arbor, MI. Protein concentrations were determined using the Bradford microassay (Bio-Rad) with bovine serum albumin as the standard. The SCAN domain sequences were aligned using the ClustalW alignment program in MacVector, version 6.5.3. Analysis of the Celera human genome data base has revealed the presence of ∼60 genes containing the SCAN domain (1Lander E.S. Linton L.M. Birren B. Nusbaum C. Zody M.C. Baldwin J. Devon K. Dewar K.

Below the sequences is a compilation of the predicted secondary structure based on several publicly available programs, with “H” corresponding to a residue predicted to be in an α-helix by all of the programs, and “h” corresponding to a residue predicted to be in an α-helix by some but not all of the programs. The secondary structure prediction algorithms predict three to five α-helices within the SCAN domain. Based on the sequence alignment, the secondary structure prediction, and the biochemical properties of the recombinant protein detailed below, the SCAN domain is being defined as 84 residues, beginning with E-43 and ending with R-126 of ZNF174. In addition, there are frequently one or more proline residues just before and after the domain. In initial studies we examined the behavior of an N-terminal region of ZNF174 that contained the SCAN domain (10Williams A.J. Blacklow S.C. Collins T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8526-8535Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Collectively, these previous studies, as well as work by others with the SCAN domain of ZNF202 (11Schumacher C. Wang H. Honer C. Ding W. Koehn J. Lawrence Q. Coulis C.M. Wang L.L. Ballinger D. Bowen B.R. Wagner S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17173-17179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), demonstrate that the SCAN domain behaves as an oligomeric species under near physiologic conditions. However, the precise subunit stoichiometry of the oligomeric SCAN complexes was not determined. To better define the nature of the SCAN domain, we over-expressed and purified to homogeneity only the isolated SCAN domain (amino acids 37–132) from ZNF174 (Fig. 2). The 98-residue recombinant protein consists of the 96 residues illustrated in Fig. 1, preceded by glycine-serine. The protein was prepared as a GST fusion, affinity-purified, cleaved with thrombin to remove the GST, and then subjected to cation exchange and size exclusion chromatographies (Fig. 2 A). The protein preparation yields about 0.3 mg/liter of bacterial cell culture. The composition of the recombinant protein was verified by both N-terminal sequencing (GSKN) and MALDI-MS (predicted 11560 Da; observed 11562 Da). The recombinant SCAN domain was subjected to analytical size exclusion chromatography. The protein eluted as a single peak with a retention time of 13.8 min (Fig.2 B). The following molecular mass standards were employed: myoglobin, 17 kDa, 14.5 min; ovalbumin, 44 kDa, 12.5 min; IgG, 158 kDa, 11.2 min; and thyroglobulin, 670 kDa, 8.9 min. Based on a plot of the logarithm of the molecular mass of the protein standardsversus the retention time, the molecular mass of the recombinant SCAN domain was determined to be 23.6 kDa. Because the subunit molecular mass is 11.56 kDa, the result indicates that the recombinant SCAN domain is a dimer. Given that knowledge of the precise subunit stoichiometry of oligomeric SCAN is critical for understanding its function, the native molecular mass of the recombinant SCAN domain was further assessed by sedimentation equilibrium. Sedimentation equilibrium is generally considered the definitive method for determining the native molecular mass of an oligomeric protein in solution, as it assesses the protein in solution at equilibrium (20Darawshe S. Minton A.P. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 220: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Unlike gel filtration and velocity-sedimentation based measurements, sedimentation equilibrium analysis is independent of the shape of the molecule. The defining characteristic of sedimentation equilibrium is the concentration gradient that forms at equilibrium as the flux of sedimenting protein is exactly balanced by the flux of diffusing molecules. The analysis was performed at three rotor speeds (16,000, 21,000, and 26,000 rpm) and three different protein concentrations (5, 15, and 50 μm). Absorbances were recorded at three wavelengths (229, 236, and 280 nm) in triplicate. When the natural log of the absorbance is plotted against the square of the radius, a linear plot is obtained, the slope of which allows for the calculation of the native molecular mass of the oligomer. A representative plot at a rotor speed of 16,000 rpm and at a protein concentration of 50 μm is shown in Fig.3 A. Also on this plot are the calculated lines that would result for a protein with a subunit mass of 11.56 kDa and with oligomeric subunit stoichiometries of 1, 2, or 3. The residuals from a best fit of the plotted data are shown in Fig.3 B. The calculated subunit stoichiometry for each protein concentration is depicted in Fig. 3 C. The values were averaged over the three acquisitions and for the three different rotor speeds. The sedimentation equilibrium results clearly demonstrate that the isolated SCAN domain is a dimer. CD spectra of the recombinant isolated SCAN domain shows that the protein has a high degree of secondary structure (Fig.4 A). Analysis of the spectra reveals that the SCAN domain has about 42% α-helix. These values are in good agreement with secondary structure predictions described above, which yield estimations of helical content ranging from 36 to 63%. Thermal denaturation of the isolated SCAN domain was performed to investigate the stability of the SCAN dimer. The loss of negative ellipticity at 222 nm was monitored by CD spectroscopy as the temperature was increased. This analysis shows that unfolding is sigmoidal and single phase (Fig. 4 B). The protein is surprisingly stable, with a melting temperature (T m) of 75 °C at 5 μm subunit. The thermal denaturation was reversible with the same T m as for unfolding and with 94% of the negative ellipticity at 222 nm recovered upon stepwise lowering of the temperature. As a consequence of the dimeric structure of the SCAN domain, the apparent stability should depend upon the protein concentration. In fact, as the protein concentration is decreased, the T m is shifted to a lower temperature (72 °C with 2 μm subunit). This trend is consistent with a two-state model in which folded dimer is in equilibrium with unfolded monomer. To minimize the possible proaggregatory effects of residues outside the actual SCAN domain, sequences of the 60 SCAN domains from the human genome were aligned to more clearly define the limits of the domain. In addition, secondary structure predictions were used to help predict where structural elements may begin and end. Based on this analysis the domain is defined as 84 residues extending from E-43 to R-126 in ZNF174. In many sequences, there are proline residues both before and after the domain, which helps to delineate the boundaries of the predicted secondary structural elements. The secondary structure prediction algorithms predict the presence of three to five α-helices in the domain. The limits for the domain described here are in good agreement with those listed in two on-line domain data bases. 5Prosite is found at expasy.ch/cgi-bin/nicesite.pl?PS50804, Pfam at sanger.ac.uk/cgi-bin/Pfam/getacc?PF02023, and SMART at smart. embl-heidelberg.de/. In Prosite the domain is defined as ZNF174 residues 46–128, and in Pfam the domain is defined as ZNF174 residues 40–135. The third on-line domain data base, SMART (which refers to the domain as LER), currently defines the domain as ZNF174 residues 42–154. However, the additional ∼25 residues at the C terminus show much less homology than those within the domain as defined here. These additional residues are clearly not required for the formation of a stable recombinant protein, as they are lacking in the construct employed here. Thus, it is concluded that the SCAN domain extends from E-43 to R-126 (in ZNF174) and is frequently flanked by one or more proline residues on both ends. SCAN domain proteins have been shown by in vitroco-expression studies to form homo- and hetero-oliogomers (10Williams A.J. Blacklow S.C. Collins T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8526-8535Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 11Schumacher C. Wang H. Honer C. Ding W. Koehn J. Lawrence Q. Coulis C.M. Wang L.L. Ballinger D. Bowen B.R. Wagner S. J. Biol.

Previous studies on recombinant polypeptides containing SCAN domains have also shown these proteins to be oligomers (10Williams A.J. Blacklow S.C. Collins T. Mol. Cell.

However, in both of these studies, the precise oligomeric subunit stoichiometry was not clear, as the recombinant proteins demonstrated a retention time on gel filtration significantly shorter than would be expected for a simple dimeric species. However, in contrast to these previous studies, the protein employed here was a stable dimer not only on gel filtration but also by definitive sedimentation equilibrium analysis. This construct was designed to minimize nonspecific interactions (i.e. aggregation) and thus has allowed for the definitive determination of the subunit stoichiometry. Furthermore, the molecule used here was well behaved biophysically as evidenced by reversible thermal denaturation. The high degree of stability of the SCAN dimer, as indicated by the T m of over 70 °C, is ideal for a protein that may serve as a dimerization domain, as is the case with BTB/POZ (21Melnick A. Ahmad K.F. Arai S. Polinger A. Ball H. Borden K.L. Carlile G.W. Prive G.G. Licht J.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6550-6567Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) and with the leucine zippers of GCN4, FOS, and JUN (22O'Shea E.K. Rutkowski R. Kim P.S.

These studies indicate that the isolated SCAN domain forms dimers and suggests that the SCAN domain is utilized as a dimerization domain by multidomain zinc finger-containing transcription factors. However, most of the proteins in the SCAN family contain multiple zinc fingers, which could presumably enable them to bind DNA as monomers. Thus, a key question concerns why these transcription factors may need to dimerize for proper biological function. Analysis of the human genome indicates that there are ∼60 SCAN-containing transcription factors present (1Lander E.S. Linton L.M. Birren B. Nusbaum C. Zody M.C. Baldwin J. Devon K. Dewar K. Doyle M.

Biol. 2001; 21: 3609-3615Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar).4 Furthermore, SCAN appears to be a vertebrate-specific (if not mammal-specific) domain. Given that there are 60 SCAN domain-containing proteins in humans and that the SCAN domain can dimerize, it then follows that there are 1830 possible dimeric complexes that could result from these 60 human genes (not accounting for alternatively spliced forms). However, because in vitro co-expression studies have suggested that there is selectivity in homo- and heterodimer formation (10Williams A.J. Blacklow S.C. Collins T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8526-8535Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 11Schumacher C. Wang H. Honer C. Ding W. Koehn J. Lawrence Q. Coulis C.M. Wang L.L. Ballinger D. Bowen B.R. Wagner S. J. Biol.

Nonetheless, the introduction of the SCAN domain within a defined set of zinc finger-containing transcription factors allows for a potentially large diversity in the number of transcription factors available to the species. Complex organisms may require this diversity in transcription factors for development and homeostasis. Investigations to determine the structural characteristics regulating selective homo- and heterodimer formation are in progress."

Yeast two-hybrid protein interaction screening was used to search for proteins that associate with PKL12 and to delineate signaling pathways and/or regulatory circuits in which this kinase participates. One positive clone contained an open reading frame highly similar toN-acetylglucosamine kinase (GlcNAcK) of several species. The PKL12/GlcNAcK interaction was further confirmed both in vitro and in vivo. Protein expression analysis of GlcNAcK using a specific rabbit antiserum displayed a ubiquitous pattern in cell lines and animal tissues. Subcellular localization studies showed that GlcNAcK is a cytoplasmic protein with a dual subcellular localization, distributed between the perinuclear and peripheral cell reservoirs. After overexpression, GlcNAcK localizes in vesicular structures associated mainly with the cell membrane and colocalizes with the PKL12 protein. GlcNAcK is not otherwise a substrate for PKL12 activity and PKL12 does not appear to influence GlcNAcK activity either in vitro or in vivo. In vitro kinase assays have nonetheless revealed that functional GlcNAcK, although not able to modulate autophosphorylation of PKL12, greatly influences PKL12 kinase activity on a defined substrate protein. These results are interpreted to indicate a potential in vivo role for GlcNAcK in PKL12 translocation and a tentative regulatory role for PKL12-mediated phosphorylation on substrate proteins.

Transient overexpression of PKL12 in NIH-3T3 cells promotes its accumulation in structures related to filopodia and lamellipodia, inducing redistribution of focal contacts and disorganization of the actin cytoskeleton but no marked alterations in Golgi.2 A regulatory role is thus hypothesized for PKL12 in the control of extracellular matrix-cell adhesion, mediating the dynamic equilibrium of organization/disorganization of focal adhesion structures and actin cytoskeleton.2 Concurring with this proposal, high level forced expression of PKL12 protein in adherent cell lines appears to be incompatible with their survival, whereas PKL12 can be overexpressed in non-adhesion-dependent cell lines without disturbing growth and survival parameters.2 Based on a two-hybrid analysis, we have identified and demonstrated functional interaction in vitro and in vivobetween PKL12, a Golgi-resident Ser/Thr kinase, and a recently cloned enzyme (6Hinderlich S. Berger M. Schwarzkop M. Effertz K. Reutter W. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 3301-3308Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) of amino sugar metabolism, N-acetylglucosamine kinase (GlcNAcK). Although GlcNAcK is not a substrate of PKL12, nor does PKL12 influence GlcNAcK activity either in vitro orin vivo, we have found that both enzymes colocalize in vivo upon overexpression, being a functional GlcNAcK capable of influencing PKL12 kinase activity on exogenous substrates. These results indicate a potential in vivo role for GlcNAcK in PKL12 translocation and a tentative regulatory role for PKL12-mediated phosphorylation on substrate proteins. NIH-3T3 and SV40-transformed NIH-3T3 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA); BA/F3, A.20, FL5.12, WEHI3b, ST2, and EL4 cells were kindly provided by Dr. C. Martı́nez-A (Centro Nacional de Biotecnologia, Madrid, Spain); COS-1 cells were a kind gift of Dr. J. Ortı́n (Centro Nacional de Biotecnologia, Madrid, Spain). NIH-3T3, COS-1, and ST2 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Invitrogen), 2 mml-glutamine (Merck), streptomycin (0.1 mg/ml, Sigma), and penicillin (100 units/ml, Sigma). A.20, BA/F3, FL5.12, WEHI3b, and EL4 cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen) supplemented as above. BA/F3 stable clones (K3 and K8) overexpressing PKL12 protein have been described.2 The yeast two-hybrid protein interaction screen was carried out essentially as described (7McNabb D.S. Guarantee L. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 1996; 7: 554-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) using the HF7c yeast strain (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA). Murine PKL12 was fused to the GAL4 DNA-binding domain in the pGBT8 vector (kindly provided by Dr. M. Serrano), generating the pGBT8-PKL12 vector. The coding sequence for the murine PKL12 orf was amplified by PCR from the pcDNA3-PKL12 plasmid, using specific primers (sense primer, 5′-GATGTCGAATTCTTAATGGGCCACGCACTG-3′; antisense primer, 5′-CGACTGAGATCTTCAGATTGGGTGGTGTG-3′) for simultaneous elimination of the PKL12 orf initiation codon and creation of an EcoRI site for in-frame fusion with the GAL4 DNA binding domain in pGBT8. PCR conditions were as follows: 94 °C, 30 s; 60 °C, 1 min; 68 °C, 10 min for 12 cycles, using theTaq/Pow thermostable enzyme mixture (Expand Long Template System; Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and a 2400 PerkinElmer Life Sciences Thermocycler. The amplified products were digested withEcoRI and BglII and ligated to the pre-digested vector and transformed in E. coli XL1-blue competent cells. An NIH-3T3 cDNA library generated in the pGAD424 vector (provided by Dr. M. Serrano) was used in the screening. Yeasts stably transformed with the pGBT8-PKL12 vector, and thus able to grow in tryptophan-free medium, were obtained. Stable expression of GAL4bd-mPKL12 protein was confirmed by Western blot (not shown). Yeasts were then transformed with the NIH-3T3 cDNA library in the pGAD424 vector and selected for growth in minimal medium without tryptophan, leucine, or histidine. As positive controls, pGBT8-p16 and pGAD424-cdk4 plasmids were cotransfected in yeast; as negative controls the pGBT8 vector plasmid was cotransfected with the pGAD424-cdk4 plasmid. Yeast clones obtained after selection in tryptophan-, leucine-, and histidine-free medium were also tested for β-galactosidase expression. After isolation of pGAD424-derivative plasmids from clones positive for both selective criteria, they were re-confirmed by direct cotransfection with the pGBT8-PKL12 vector in HF7c yeast, and inserts were directly sequenced using the vector primers. Specific oligonucleotides (sense primer, 5′-AGGCGACACAGGGGCGAGAGA-3′; antisense primer, 5′-GAAAGCGGTGCCTCAACTCCTC-3′) were synthesized (Isogen, Maarssen, The Netherlands) based on the 5′ and 3′ sequences of the mSIP16 obtained from the ESTs data bank and our data. Total mRNA was prepared from NIH-3T3 cells and used to obtain cDNA. PCR was carried out on cDNA derived from NIH-3T3 cells with the primers indicated above (94 °C, 1 min; 60 °C, 1 min; 72 °C, 1,5 min; 30 cycles), using Taq/Pow as above. The fragment obtained, of the predicted size, was cloned in the pGEM-T (Promega) plasmid. Several clones were obtained and fully sequenced. The final clone selected was termed pGEM-GlcNAcK. The pcDNA3-PKL12 plasmid was obtained by subcloning mPKL12 into the pcDNA3 eukaryotic expression plasmid (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) as described.2pcDNA3-HA GlcNAcK plasmid was obtained by subcloning the GlcNAcKorf isolated from the pGEM-GlcNAcK plasmid. Specific oligonucleotides were synthesized (sense primer, 5′-TACTGAGATCTTTGGCCGCGCTTTATGGTGG; antisense primer, 5′-GAAAGCGGTGCCTCAACTCCTC-3′) to create an EcoRI site for in-frame SIP16 orf fusion with the hemagglutinin epitope (HA) in the pcDNA3.1/Neo-HA plasmid. PCR conditions were as follows: 94 °C, 30 s; 60 °C, 1 min; 68 °C, 10 min for 12 cycles. The amplified products were digested with EcoRI, ligated to the EcoRI-digested vector, and transformed inE. coli XL1-blue competent cells. Several clones were obtained, and their sequences were completely confirmed. All plasmids were purified using the Plasmid Maxi Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) following the manufacturer's instructions. Histidine-tagged PKL12 was expressed in E. coli strain M15 and purified to homogeneity using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose resin (Qiagen), as described (1Ligos J.M. Gerwin N. Fernandez P. Gutierrez-Ramos J.C. Bernad A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 249: 380-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar); GST-SIP16 protein expression and purification was performed in a similar manner. The coding sequence for the orfcorresponding to murine SIP16 was PCR-amplified from the pGAD424-SIP16 plasmid using specific primers (sense primer, 5′-TACCTGAGATCTACAGACCAGTGTGTGG-3′; antisense primer, 5′-ATACGAATTCACTAGAAGGTATAGGAATA-3′) for simultaneous elimination of the SIP16 open reading frame initiation codon and creation of aBamHI site for in-frame fusion with the GST protein in the pGEX-2T plasmid (Amersham Biosciences). PCR conditions were as follows: 94 °C, 30 s; 60 °C, 1 min; 68 °C, 10 min for 12 cycles. Amplified products were BamHI-digested, ligated to the digested vector, and transformed in E. coli XL1-blue competent cells. Several clones were obtained and their sequences completely confirmed. GST-tagged SIP16 protein was expressed inE. coli (XL1B strain) and purified using the GST Gene Fusion System (Amersham Biosciences) following manufacturer's guidelines.E. coli extracts were prepared as described (1Ligos J.M. Gerwin N. Fernandez P. Gutierrez-Ramos J.C. Bernad A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 249: 380-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar); those containing the expressed GST-SIP16 protein were loaded in a prepacked glutathione-Sepharose 4B column (Amersham Biosciences). After extensive washing, retained protein was eluted with buffer E (50 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mm glutathione). Purification was monitored by SDS-PAGE (8Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206620) Google Scholar) of aliquots of the fractions obtained, followed by Coomassie Blue staining or Western blot analysis with an anti-GST antibody (Santa Cruz, Santa Cruz, CA). A parallel negative control purification was performed using E. coli cells transformed with the vector pGEX-2T plasmid. Several independent induction/purification experiments rendered an almost pure fraction of GST-SIP16 protein, with two protein bands (see under “Results,” Fig. 3). Both bands were recognized by anti-GST antibody and the specific anti-SIP16 antiserum; we thus concluded that in E. coli or during the purification process, the SIP16 protein is proteolyzed at a specific carboxyl-terminal point, rendering both products. These bands are not present in negative control purified fractions. Control GST and GST-SP (a fusion of GST with a protein that is a substrate for the kinase activity of the PKL12 protein)2proteins were expressed and purified essentially as described for GST-SIP16. Protein concentration of purified fractions was determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay with a bovine serum albumin standard. Purified GST-tagged SIP16 protein was prepared as above. Outbred New Zealand rabbits were injected intradermally in multiple sites using 250 μg of purified protein emulsified with an equal volume of Freund's complete adjuvant. Two 125-μg intramuscular boosts of the same material in incomplete adjuvant were given 4 and 7 weeks later. Sera were collected 7 and 10 days after the last injection and tested in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; the IgG serum fraction was purified as described (1Ligos J.M. Gerwin N. Fernandez P. Gutierrez-Ramos J.C. Bernad A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 249: 380-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Cells (2 × 106) were transfected by electroporation (200 V, 960 microfarads in 0.2 ml) in a Gene Pulser (Bio-Rad) with 20 μg of pcDNA3-PKL12 or pcDNA3-HA-GlcNAcK plasmids and then cultured in standard conditions or on coverslips. After 18 h, cells were processed for Western blot analysis or fluorescence microscopy. Cells (2 × 106) were lysed in 100 μl of RIPA buffer (137 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 10% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 μg/ml aprotinin) for 30 min at 4 °C, and cellular debris was removed by centrifugation (18,000 × g, 20 min). Protein content was determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay (Bio-Rad). Protein (20 μg) was separated in SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad). The membrane was blocked for 1 h in Tris-buffered saline (25 mm Tris; TBS) plus 0.1% Tween, with 5% non-fat dry milk, followed by incubation with primary antibody for 2 h and secondary antibody for 40 min. Western blots were developed using the ECL system (Amersham Biosciences). The polyclonal anti-PKL12 and anti-GlcNAcK antisera were used at 1:2000 and 1:3000 dilution, respectively. Cells were transfected as above, cultured for an additional 24 h, and lysed in 100 μl of IP buffer (150 mm NaCl, 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mg/ml leupeptin, 1 mg/ml pepstatin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 μg/ml aprotinin) for 30 min at 4 °C, and cellular debris was removed by centrifugation. Protein content was determined as above. Protein (200 μg) in 0.5 ml of IP buffer was incubated with 5 μl of polyclonal anti-PKL12 antibody or 5 μl of polyclonal anti-GlcNAcK antibody (16 h, 4 °C), followed by incubation with protein A-Sepharose beads (Sigma) for 1 h. After extensive washing with IP buffer, immune complexes were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. Cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (10 min, room temperature) and then washed three times in PBST (PBS containing 0.1% Tween). Preparations were incubated with PBS plus 20% fetal calf serum (1 h, room temperature) followed by primary antibody (1 h). After washing with PBST and staining with secondary antibody (40 min), cells were washed and mounted in ProLong Antifade mounting medium (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Polyclonal anti-PKL12 and anti-GlcNAcK antisera were used at 1:150 and 1:100 dilutions, respectively. Murine anti-HA monoclonal antibody (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) was used at 1:1000 dilution. Secondary antibodies Alexa 488-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG, Cy3-goat anti-rabbit IgG, and Cy2-goat anti-mouse IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch) were used following the manufacturer's instructions. In vitro kinase assays using purified proteins were performed as follows: 35 μl of reaction buffer containing the indicated amount of recombinant histidine-tagged PKL12, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm MnCl2, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm ATP, and 10 μCi/μl of [γ-32P]ATP, 3000 Ci/mmol (Amersham Biosciences), were preincubated (30 °C, 1 min) and then mixed with 10 ml of the same buffer containing the indicated amounts of the purified putative substrate and/or modulator proteins. Reactions were incubated (30 °C, 30 min), terminated by addition of Laemmli sample buffer, and proteins separated in 10% SDS-PAGE gels. After Coomassie Blue staining, the gel was dried and autoradiographed. As a negative control, equivalent fractions purified from E. coli vector-transformed clones were assayed. BAF/3 PKL12-stable clones cells (2 × 106) or transiently transfected NIH-3T3 or COS-1 cells (2 × 106) were prepared as described.2PBS-washed cells were lysed by hypotonic shock in 200 μl of 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The lysate was centrifuged (30,000 × g, 20 min), the supernatant assayed for GlcNAcK activity, and analyzed for GlcNAcK expression in Western blot. In vitro GlcNAcK activity was determined as described (7McNabb D.S. Guarantee L. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 1996; 7: 554-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). In brief, GlcNAcK assays were performed in a final volume of 225 μl containing 60 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 20 mmMgCl2, 5 mm GlcNAc, 10 mm ATP (disodium salt), 10 mm phosphoenolpyruvate, 2.5 units of pyruvate kinase, 50 nCi of [1-14C]GlcNAc, and variable amounts of protein extract. Incubations were carried out (37 °C, 2 h), and the reaction was terminated by adding 350 μl of ethanol. Radiolabeled substrates were separated by descendent paper chromatography and measured by liquid scintillation analysis. Initial comparative sequence searches were performed using the BLAST algorithm (9Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (69694) Google Scholar) on a non-redundant data base (EMBL NRDB). Additional remote homologue searching was done by HMM (hmm search, default parameters) over protein NRDB data base (10Durbin R. Eddy S. Krogh A. Mitchison G. The Theory Behind Profile HMMs: Biological Sequence Analysis: Probabilistic Models of Proteins and Nucleic Acids. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK1998Google Scholar). Sequences were aligned with ClustalW software (11Thompson J.D. Gibson T.J. Plewniak F. Jeanmougin F. Higgins D.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 24: 4876-4882Crossref Scopus (35296) Google Scholar). Alignment visualization was performed with Belvu (E. Sonnhammer, www.cgr.ki.se/cgr/groups/sonnhammer/Belvu.html). Complementary data and alignments are available on request at www.cnb.uam.es/∼cnbprot/priv/STK/SIP16. We used the yeast two-hybrid protein interaction screen to search for proteins able to associate with the murine PKL12 (STK16) Ser/Thr kinase and to delineate signaling pathways and/or regulatory circuits in which this kinase participates. PKL12 is expressed ubiquitously, and NIH-3T3 cells are a study model (1Ligos J.M. Gerwin N. Fernandez P. Gutierrez-Ramos J.C. Bernad A. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Several clones were selected that grew under the selection conditions and also expressed lacZ, the second transactivable marker gene. pGAD424 plasmids harbored by the positive yeast clones were isolated; positive interaction was confirmed by individual cotransformation of HF7c yeast with pGBT8-PKL12 plasmid or the negative controls pGBT8-p16 (12Serrano M. Hannon G.J. Beach D. Nature. 1993; 336: 704-707Crossref Scopus (3364) Google Scholar) and pGBT8. Positive clones were isolated and fully sequenced. Several positive clones (representing 23% of sequences obtained) were found containing partial sequences corresponding to the same gene. The clone containing the longest open reading frame corresponded to a 334-amino acid protein (38 kDa) in phase with GAL4db. This clone, pGAD424-SIP16Δ, was selected for some of the additional experiments. This protein was denominated SIP16 (STK-16 interacting protein), as sequence homology analysis showed that it has a yet undescribed function. Homologous EST sequences from several murine and human tissues and a Caenorhabditis elegans (WO6B4.2) protein (unknown function) showed significant similarity to the SIP16Δ encoded orf. Based on the data bank-annotated EST sequences, we identified the putative 5′-untranslated region sequence and the transcription initiation codon of the mSIP16 orf. We designed specific oligonucleotides to clone the full-length cDNA, which was obtained from NIH-3T3 cells. mSIP16 protein consists of 343 amino acids (approximate mass 40 kDa), and hSIP16 was electronically assembled from the data bank EST sequences. Similarity searches using human and murine sequences (92% similarity) revealed the presence of ortholog sequences in several other eukaryotic organisms (Fig. 1), includingDrosophila melanogaster and Streptomyces coelicolor (43 and 27% similarity, respectively), and partial EST sequences in pig, bull, rat, and Xenopus (not shown). All sequences are related by the presence of a conserved ATP-binding site, with the recognized subdomains (I–V) (13Bork P. Sander C. Valencia A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7290-7294Crossref PubMed Scopus (701) Google Scholar). Remarkably, all sequences are similar in size, around 330 amino acids, except that of C. elegans, which contains an additional amino-terminal domain (1–192 amino acids) not shared by the other putative orthologues. Comparison with prokaryotic sequences by HMM search (10Durbin R. Eddy S. Krogh A. Mitchison G. The Theory Behind Profile HMMs: Biological Sequence Analysis: Probabilistic Models of Proteins and Nucleic Acids. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK1998Google Scholar) showed significant relationship with members of the ROK family containing sugar kinases (13Bork P. Sander C. Valencia A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7290-7294Crossref PubMed Scopus (701) Google Scholar). Fig. 1 shows the amino acid sequence comparison between eukaryotic enzymes and the most representative members of the prokaryotic family, including the YHCI, YAJF, YCFX, and ALSK enzymes from E. coli and SCRK from Bacillus subtilis. These data strongly suggested that SIP16 is a eukaryotic sugar kinase. When preparing the first version of this manuscript, a final search in the data banks revealed that new sequences were included (NP_062415; NP_060037; CAB61849) with high similarity (98%) to mSIP16. These sequences corresponded to the murine and human GlcNAcK proteins (6Hinderlich S. Ber"

On the one hand, each component of the complex was compared with known atomic structures of related enzymes or of similar enzymes originating from different organisms. On the other hand, the overall low resolution architecture of the whole complex was studied using cryoelectron microscopy and image processing techniques. The dimers of phosphoribulokinase are suspected to undergo a dramatic change in activity during a cycle of binding and detaching from tetramers of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase.

There is mounting evidence that in eukaryotic cells most enzymes are associated with cell organelles and with other proteins referred to as multienzyme complexes (1Goodsell D.S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 203-206Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). The main functional advantage for these supramolecular edifices may be a direct metabolite transfer, or channeling, from active site to active site avoiding milieu diffusion, but there is vast (although conflicting) literature about the existence and purpose of these channeling effects (2Easterby J.S. Biochem. J. 1989; 264: 605-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 3Ovadi J. J. Theor. Biol. 1991; 152: 1-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 4Wu X.M. Gutfreund H. Lakatos S.

Moreover, this direct transfer requires that enzymes catalyze consecutive reactions in these complexes. Although numerous multienzyme complexes belong to this category, others do not. In the latter case, the functional advantage of physical association relies on the alteration of intrinsic properties of the enzymes involved in these supramolecular edifices. We have purified a bi-enzyme complex, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (EC 1.2.1.13) and phosphoribulokinase (EC 2.7.1.19), from the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii (6Avilan L. Gontero B. Lebreton S. Ricard J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 246: 78-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). This complex is involved in the Benson-Calvin cycle responsible for CO2assimilation. It has an overall molecular mass of 460 kDa and comprises two (2 × 80 kDa) dimeric molecules of phosphoribulokinase (PRK) 1PRKphosphoribulokinaseGAPDHglyceraldehydes-3-phosphate dehydrogenasecryoEMcryoelectron microscopyFSCFourier Shell CorrelationEMelectron microscope and two (2 × 150 kDa) tetrameric molecules of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH). Whereas PRK catalyzes the ATP-dependent phosphorylation of ribulose-5-phosphate to form ribulose-1,5-biphosphate (the CO2 acceptor in photosynthetic organisms), GAPDH catalyzes the reversible reduction and dephosphorylation of 1,3-biphosphoglyceric acid into glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate using NADPH or NADH. These two enzymes are light-regulated and play a key role in the Benson-Calvin cycle, because this metabolic pathway only operates under light (7Buchanan B.B. Ann. Rev. Plant Physiol. 1980; 31: 341-374Crossref Google Scholar, 8Leegood R.C. Lea P.J. Methods in Plant Biochem.3. Academic Press, London1990: 15-37Google Scholar). The existence of a multienzyme complex between these two enzymes has been reported in many photosynthetic organisms (6Avilan L. Gontero B. Lebreton S. Ricard J. Eur. J.

Gontero B. Avilan L. Ricard J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 246: 85-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The first is embedded in the complex. The second is released from the complex upon high dilution (100-fold) or reduction with a reducing agent such as dithiothreitol. This second form, the designated metastable form, bears an imprint from GAPDH for a while and then slowly relapses into a third form, the stable PRK. The stable enzyme is devoid of activity when oxidized, whereas the form inserted in the complex and the metastable enzyme are active in oxidized state with respective catalytic constants kcat equal to 0.062 s−1/site, 3 s−1/site, and 56.3 s−1/site. The metastable state is very active because it retains the imprint effect exerted by GAPDH, and it is more active than the same enzyme bound to GAPDH, probably because catalysis requires significant mobility that is reduced within the complex. This oxidized metastable form, competent for catalysis, then reaches a stable inactive conformation. TheK m of these three oxidized forms are also quite different and higher for the stable form than for the two other forms (15Lebreton S. Gontero B. Avilan L. Ricard J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 246: 85-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). From these data, it is clear that GAPDH has given to PRK instructions that result in an increase of activity. Another result further supports this contention; mixing stable oxidized inactive PRK with GAPDH to reconstitute the complex in vitro (6Avilan L. Gontero B. Lebreton S. Ricard J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 246: 78-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) gives rise to an active PRK. Under the reduced state, the K m for the three forms are nearly equivalent, but the kcat for the reduced metastable form (300 s−1 /site) is also higher than for the two others (16Lebreton S.

The reaction mechanisms are clearly distinct in the binding mode of the substrates or in the product inhibition type (17Lebreton S. Gontero B. Avilan L. Ricard J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 250: 286-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), and phosphoribulokinase (inserted into the complex) is more amenable to thioredoxin activation than the stable form (18Avilan L. Lebreton S. Gontero B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9447-9451Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Thus, these data clearly demonstrate the role of protein-protein interactions in the alteration of kinetic properties of enzymes (19Ricard J. Gontero B. Avilan L. Lebreton S. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1998; 54: 1231-1248Crossref Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Whereas the functional aspects of this complex are of great importance for a better understanding of the regulation of the metabolic pathway in which it is involved, the structural aspects are of great importance to get the rationale and explanations for all of the observed differences. Nonetheless, although the function of this supramolecular structure is at least in part deciphered, the structure of this entity is completely unknown. Only the residue Arg-64 of PRK was identified as playing a major role in the association of the two enzymes (20Avilan L. Gontero B. Lebreton S. Ricard J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 250: 296-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The aim of this study is to obtain for the first time some structural data on the whole active complex using cryoelectron microscopy (cryoEM) and molecular modeling. With information on the quaternary structures of PRK of photosynthetic bacteria Rhodobacter sphaeroides(21Harrison D.H. Runquist J.A. Holub A. Miziorko H.M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5074-5085Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) and of tetrameric glycolytic GAPDH available (22Didierjean C. Rahuel-Clermont S. Vitoux B. Dideberg O. Branlant G. Aubry A. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 268: 739-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), although showing differences (light for GAPDH, wide for PRK) with the algal counterparts, the similarities between these enzymes are tentatively used to propose a three-dimensional model for the PRK-GAPDH complex. The bi-enzyme complex made up of PRK and GAPDH was purified from C. reinhardtii cells as previously described (6Avilan L. Gontero B. Lebreton S. Ricard J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 246: 78-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The complex (200 μg/ml) was diluted 5–10-fold in 100 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, 0.1 mm NAD, 5 mm cysteine, 10% glycerol. The complex integrity in the presence of 5 mmcysteine and 0.1 mm NAD was checked by electrophoresis (data not shown), but dilution (10-fold) may lead to slight depolymerization of the complex. Sample solution was applied on glow-discharged 400-mesh copper grids coated with a thin carbon film and negatively stained with 1% uranyl acetate. Grids were observed in a Philips CM12 electron microscope (EM) at an accelerating voltage of 100 kV, a magnification of ×45,000, and with condenser and objective apertures of 200 and 70 μm, respectively. Each specimen field was recorded at 1-μm defocus, and micrographs were developed for 8 min in full-strength Kodak D19 developer. Complex samples were diluted 7-fold in 50 mm acetate buffer, pH 4.5, with tobacco mosaic virus at a concentration of 8 μg/ml as an internal test molecule for quantitative measurement of the magnification. Sample solution was applied on 400-mesh copper grids coated with perforated carbon films and dialyzed twice with acetate buffer (23Cyrklaff M. Adrian M. Dubochet J. J. Electron. Microsc. Tech. 1990; 16: 351-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). After blotting the excess solution, grids were rapidly plunged into liquid ethane (24Dubochet J. Lepault J. Freeman R. Berriman J.A. Homo J.C. J. Microsc. 1982; 128: 219-237Crossref Scopus (356) Google Scholar, 25Adrian M. Dubochet J. Lepault J. McDowall A.W. Nature. 1984; 308: 32-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (974) Google Scholar), and frozen-hydrated samples were transferred with a Gatan 626N cryoholder to a Philips CM12 electron microscope equipped with a Gatan 651N anticontaminator. Images were recorded at an accelerating voltage of 100 kV with condenser and objective apertures of 200 and 70 μm, respectively. A magnification of ×42,483 ± 1% was measured from the tobacco mosaic virus (26Boisset N. Mouche F. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 296: 459-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Each specimen field was recorded twice with the grid tilted at 45° and untilted with defocuses of 2.7 and 2.5 μm, respectively. Micrographs were recorded under low dose conditions and developed for 9 min in full-strength Kodak D19 developer. For later refinements, additional untilted-specimen images were recorded at defocuses ranging from 0.8 to 1.4 μm to allow good signal retrieval through correction of the contrast transfer function. Selected micrographs were digitized with an Optronics P1000 drum rotating microdensitometer using an aperture and scanning step of 25 μm corresponding to a pixel size of 5.885 Å on the specimen. All programs used for image processing are part of the SPIDER and WEB software (27Frank J. Radermacher M. Penczek P. Zhu J., Li, Y. Ladjadj M. Leith A. J. Struct. Biol. 1996; 116: 190-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (1816) Google Scholar). The isolated particles from tilted-and untilted-specimen images were interactively selected, boxed, and normalized (28Boisset N. Penczek P. Pochon F. Frank J. Lamy J. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 232: 522-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The three-dimensional reconstruction was carried out using the method of random conical-tilt series (29Radermacher M. Wagenknecht T. Verschoor A. Frank J. J. Microsc. 1987; 146: 113-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). Untilted-specimen images were aligned and classified using rotationally invariant K-means classification approach (30Penczek P.A. Zhu J. Frank J. Ultramicroscopy. 1996; 63: 205-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). For each selected homogeneous images class, a three-dimensional reconstruction volume was computed from the corresponding tilted-specimen images. These volumes were aligned in a similar orientation, and a merged three-dimensional reconstruction was computed and further refined using the method of three-dimensional projection alignment (31Penczek P.A. Grassucci R.A. Frank J. Ultramicroscopy. 1994; 53: 251-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). Finally, a better resolved three-dimensional reconstruction volume was computed from a new series of untilted-specimen images and recorded at low defocus (0.8 to 1.4 μm), using three-dimensional projection alignment (31Penczek P.A. Grassucci R.A. Frank J. Ultramicroscopy. 1994; 53: 251-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar) and Wiener filtering to correct for the contrast transfer function of the microscope (26Boisset N. Mouche F. J. Mol.

Biol. 2001; 133: 176-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Resolution was estimated using the Fourier Shell Correlation (FSC) criterion (34Saxton W.O. Baumeister W. J. Microsc. 1982; 127: 127-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (701) Google Scholar, 35van Heel M. Ultramicroscopy. 1987; 21: 95-100Crossref Scopus (304) Google Scholar) using either a cutting level derived from the 3ς noise curve (FSC3ς) (36Orlova E.V. Dube P. Harris J.R. Beckman E. Zemlin F. Markl J. van Heel M. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 271: 417-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar) or a cutting level of 0.5 (FSC0.5) corresponding to a signal-to-noise ratio of 1 (Penczek and co-workers (Ref. 37Malhotra A. Penczek P. Agrawal R.K. Gabashvili I.S. Grassucci R.A. Junemann R. Burkhardt N. Nierhaus K.H. Frank J. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 280: 103-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, appendix)). The final volume was low pass-filtered to its resolution limit (FSC3ς) and was rescaled with minimum and maximum densities of 0.0 and 1.0, respectively. The volume was explored with the help of IRIS Explorer (Numerical Algorithms Group, Inc., Downers Grove, IL) software. Each surface rendering is characterized by the density selected as a threshold value between protein and ice (between 0 and 1) and by the corresponding volume of protein (in nm3). Orthologuous sequences were first searched using BLAST2 (38Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (60233) Google Scholar), and the resulting multiple alignments were refined using Hydrophobic Cluster Analysis (39Callebaut I. Labesse G. Durand P. Poupon A. Canard L. Chomilier J. Henrissat B. Mornon J.P. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1997; 53: 621-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). These alignments were then used to generate three-dimensional models using the program Modeler 4 (40Sali A. Blundell T.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 779-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (10636) Google Scholar). The coordinates of the models were checked using Verify3D (41Luthy R. Bowie J.U. Eisenberg D. Nature. 1992; 356: 83-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (2616) Google Scholar) and Procheck (42Morris A.L. MacArthur M.W. Hutchinson E.G. Thornton J.M.

Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar) algorithms. Attempts to fit atomic models of GAPDH tetramers and PRK dimers into the low resolution three-dimensional cryoEM volume of the whole complex were carried out with the Situs 1.4 software (44Wriggers W. Milligan R.A. McCammon J.A. J. Struct. Biol. 1999; 125: 185-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar, 45Wriggers W. Birmanns S. J. Struct. Biol. 2001; 133: 193-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar) using the vector quantitation algorithm (46Wriggers W. Milligan R.A. Schulten K. McCammon J.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 284: 1247-1254Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) and were visualized using the VMD 1.5 program (47Humphrey W. Dalke A. Schulten K. J. Mol. Graphics. 1996; 14: 33-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (39882) Google Scholar). Three types of macromolecular assemblies are present within the image fields obtained by the negative staining technique (Fig.1 A). First, most isolated particles have a rod-like shape composed of at least two main masses and some smaller extensions (squares). The overall dimensions of these particles (20 × 10 nm) are in good agreement with the expected size for the GAPDH-PRK complex. To better grasp the features, a set of 2,984 images of rod-like-shaped isolated particles were subjected to rotationally invariant K-means classification (30Penczek P.A. Zhu J. Frank J. Ultramicroscopy. 1996; 63: 205-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Four typical average maps are shown in Fig. 1, B–E. Second, some smaller assemblies (circles) may correspond to partially degraded complexes. Finally, long flexible strings of material (arrow) are visible in most fields of the grid. They seem to contain subassemblies corresponding to the rod-like-shaped particles (squares) or at least part of them (circles) observed in Fig. 1 A. When carefully looking at the average maps of the rod-like-shaped particles, they correspond to two main types of views that we designated as 2-fold (Fig. 1, B and C) and asymmetric rod-like (Fig.1, D and E). The 2-fold views comprise two antiparallel identical motifs disposed around a central cavity. Each motif comprises a main trapezoidal mass and a small comma-shaped expansion. The name given to this electron microscope view indicates the obvious presence of a central 2-fold symmetry axis in the complex. Although the average maps of Fig.1, B and C both qualify as 2-fold views, they possess distinct features. First, in Fig. 1 B some dark channels are visible in the main trapezoidal masses, whereas in Fig.1 C these masses are compact, because no stain penetrates into local notches. Second, the small comma-shaped expansions visible near the central part of the complex have different positions. In Fig.1 B they are connected mainly to one trapezoidal mass, and they delineate a central oblique cleft going from the upper left to the lower right edges of the complex. Conversely, in Fig. 1 Ceach comma-shaped expansion equally binds to both main trapezoidal masses, thus closing this central oblique cleft. The overall dimensions of the complex measured on the 2-fold view of Fig. 1 Bcorrespond to 21 ± 3 nm × 14 ± 3 nm. The asymmetric rod-like views (Fig. 1, D and E) bear some resemblance to the first type of 2-fold view (Fig.1 B) when considering the shape of the large trapezoidal masses. However, only one smaller expansion is clearly visible in the central lower part of the particle, forming a strong spot of stain exclusion. The upper expansion is still slightly visible in Fig.1 D as a gray area, but it disappears almost completely in Fig. 1 E. These observations may correspond to a rocking of the particles on the support carbon film. For the computation of three-dimensional reconstruction volumes, the GAPDH-PRK complex was observed in vitreous ice with a defocus of 1.9 μm (Fig.2 A) for the first three-dimensional reconstruction using the single exposure random conical-tilt series technique (29Radermacher M. Wagenknecht T. Verschoor A. Frank J. J. Microsc. 1987; 146: 113-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). A refined volume was then computed from a set of 6,057 untilted-specimen images selected from 17 micrographs with defocuses ranging from 1.4 to 0.8 μm (Fig.2 B). A unique three-dimensional reconstruction volume was then computed with the Wiener filtering approach (26Boisset N. Mouche F. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 296: 459-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 32Frank J. Penczek P. Optik. 1995; 98: 125-129Google Scholar, 33Mouche F. Boisset N. Penczek P.A. J. Struct. Biol. 2001; 133: 176-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) using an amplitude contrast of 5%, a source size of 4·10−3 Å, an envelope half-width of 9·10−3 Å, and a signal-to-noise ratio of 3. To check the validity of this three-dimensional reconstruction volume, Fig. 2, C–J shows some experimental cryoEM average images (avg) with, next to them, the surface rendering of the three-dimensional reconstruction volume (vol) and the corresponding two-dimensional projection map (prj) mimicking the orientation of the particles in the vitreous ice layer of the EM grid. For example, one can observe four types of cryoEM images resembling the asymmetric rod-like view (Fig. 2,D, E, G, and H) and only one type of 2-fold view (Fig. 2 C). Furthermore, some particles produce new types of views in the ice layer that resemble an annulus (Fig. 2 F) with two small expansions (Fig.2 I). Therefore, we refer to such orientations of the particles in the ice layer as the annular view. Some particles also produce a trapezoidal view with two smaller expansions (Fig.2 J). Although this last type of cryoEM view is much smaller than the previous one, we see that the volume in a new orientation of the complex can easily produce it. To better grasp the outer boundaries and the high density zones within the three-dimensional reconstruction volume, two series of surface representations are shown in Fig. 3. The first set of surface renderings was computed with a threshold of 0.44 and corresponds to a volume occupancy of 1102 nm3 (Fig. 3,A, C, E, and G), whereas the second set was computed with a threshold density of 0.64, corresponding to only 326 nm3 (Fig. 3, B,D, F, and H). In each set of surface representation, the volumes are shown as if observing the particle in a cubic box oriented at its top (A andB), bottom (C and D),front (E and F), andprofile (G and H) views, respectively. Because the volume was computed with a 2-fold symmetry, the front and back views are identical to the left and right profile views. Furthermore, for the sake of clarity, the lettering L for large masses, P for protrusions, and E for expansions designates the building blocks observed in the volume. Each of them is present in two copies, symmetrically disposed around the 2-fold axis. Therefore, we observe six building blocks in the complex named L1, L2, E1, E2, P1, and P2. Depending on the threshold used for surface rendering the overall size of the particle may vary significantly. However, the width, height, and depth of the particle can be estimated to be close to 220, 150, and 150 Å, respectively, when measured on the front view and taking a median threshold density value of 0.5 corresponding to a volume of 770 nm3 (Fig. 5 B). In the top view (Fig.3 A), the two large lateral masses (L1 and L2) are connected in the front with the two triangular expansions (L1–E1 and L2–E2) and at the back with the two protrusions (L1–P1 and L2–P2). When looking at the high density zones of the volume (Fig. 3 B) these masses are totally individuated, and the central smaller expansions form a parallelogram with the longest diagonal oriented in the upper left direction. From Fig. 3 the most probable location for the GAPDH tetramers seems to be the two lateral masses (L1 and L2), whereas the four copies of PRK may correspond to the smaller masses (E1, E2, P1, and P2). In the front orientation (Fig. 3, E andF), the hollow nature of the complex is clearly visible, and a central void space is limited at each side by the large lateral masses (L1 and L2) and above and below by the small high density zones E1/E2 and P1/P2, respectively. In this orientation, the E1/E2 expansions appear as oblong bodies, whereas the lower protrusions P1/P2 are less elongated. However, they are located in close proximity to the lower edge of the lateral masses so that it is difficult to point to the exact boundaries between the two types of masses. The striking feature is the overall distribution of the high density zones within an ellipsoid that is clearly reminiscent of the annular view (Fig. 2,F and I). Even the large lateral masses that appear as bulky material in all other views take a curved shape resembling a baseball glove in this specific orientation. Finally, in the profile view (Fig. 3, G and H) one can see the large gap between the E1/E2 expansions, whereas the lower protrusions P1/P2 appear in closer vicinity. We next tried to correlate these low resolution structural data of the complex with the atomic structures of each of its components for which experimental atomic structures are available in other species. Three-dimensional models of the C. reinhardtii GAPDH and PRK were thus generated by homology using the known structures of the Bacillus stearothermophilus andR. sphaeroides enzymes, respectively. Modeling of C. reinhardtii GAPDH using theB. stearothermophilus structure as template (PDB identifier,3DBV) indicates a very similar structure (0.4 Å root mean-squared deviation between the 666 superimposable Cα atoms) supported by a high level of sequence identity (58% in Fig.4 A). Because the B. stearothermophilus GAPDH (similar to the C. reinhardtii GAPDH) is organized as a tetramer, and regions involved in the tetramer contacts are highly conserved, we then reproduced this quaternary structure by fitting our model onto each of the subunits of the C. reinhardtii oligomer (Fig.5, A–F). The fitting of this tetrameric model of GAPDH within the EM density was satisfactory (see “Discussion”). Modeling of the C. reinhardtii PRK structure was more difficult to perform, given the low level of sequence identity shared with the R. sphaeroides PRK sequence (below 25%), which is the only sequence with a known three-dimensional structure and could thus be used as a template (21Harrison D.H. Runquist J.A. Holub A. Miziorko H.M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5074-5085Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) (PDB identifier, 1A7J). In the alignment procedure we thus especially took into consideration information about the secondary structure, which is currently much more conserved than the primary structure. This information was gained through the use of Hydrophobic Cluster Analysis (see the Fig. 4 legend for details), a two-dimensional method of sequence analysis adding to the one-dimensional lexical comparison an analysis of secondary structures (regular secondary structures are mainly centered on the hydrophobic clusters displayed on the two-dimensional net used by this method) (39Callebaut I. Labesse G. Durand P. Poupon A. Canard L. Chomilier J. Henrissat B. Mornon J.P. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1997; 53: 621-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). The consideration of the whole PRK family also helped the alignment procedure by giving valuable information about conserved positions essential to the fold and/or function (e.g. the positions that are always occupied by hydrophobic amino acids, highlighted by stars on Fig. 4 B). Thus, although the R. sphaeroides and C. reinhardtii enzymes share as low as 22% of identity as determined after optimized alignment using Hydrophobic Cluster Analysis (see Fig. 4 legend for details), most of the hydrophobic positions contained within the core are conserved, supporting a similar global architecture for the aligned sequences. The C-terminal part of PRK proteins, ranging from strand 6 to helix H in the R. sphaeroides structure can, however, be totally different in length as well as in sequence and therefore cannot be aligned over the whole family (Fig. 4, B and C). Strands 6 and 7 as well as helix G, which are involved in protein contacts with other monomers in the octameric structure of the R. sphaeroides PRK, are in addition not present in other nucleotide monophosphate kinase family members (21Harrison D.H. Runquist J.A. Holub A. Miziorko H.M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5074-5085Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In our particular case, however, it is possible to align the two sequences from C. reinhardtii and R. sphaeroides up to strand 7, whereas the last helix (helix H) has no obvious counterpart in the C. reinhardtii sequence. This last sequence otherwise possesses additional amino acids in its C terminus (∼90) (Fig. 4 B), which were not modeled (because they share no significant similarity with possible templates) but have to be considered in the further exploitation of the model (concentric circle, size ranging between 4000 and 8000 Å3). In addition to high sequence divergence, C. reinhardtii andR. sphaeroides PRKs have differences in quaternary structures; the C. reinhardtii enzyme is organized only as a dimer whereas the R. sphaeroides enzymes, particularly prokaryotic PRKs, exist as octamers that consist of two layers of four PRK molecules. However, the dimeric organization created by the 2-fold symmetry that relates the two layers within the R. sphaeroides octamer is supposedly conserved throughout evolution (21Harrison D.H. Runquist J.A. Holub A. Miziorko H.M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5074-5085Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Indeed, regions located at the interface between the two monomers are much more conserved than other parts of the sequence (especially helices E and F/F′ and strand 5, boxed in Fig.4 B). Consequently, it is probable that the dimeric interface existing in R. sphaeroides PRK structure within the octamer is similar to that existing within the C. reinhardtiistructure (Fig. 4 C). The presence of an additional sequence in the C. reinhardtii PRK, distant from the dimeric interface and the active site but in the vicinity of helix G, which defines the opening to the center of the R. sphaeroidesoctamer, would therefore prevent the formation of octameric structures in C. reinhardtii and limit the quaternary arrangement to dimers. This dimeric organization predicted by homology should define the most compact volume of the PRK dimer, which can be used to explore EM density after subtraction of the GAPDH tetramer volume (see “Discussion”). Interactions between proteins are fundamental to a broad spectrum of biological functions. Whether or not two proteins will bind to form a stable complex that is required for biological function is dependent on the three-dimensional conformation of the proteins. Because in biology it is widely postulated that sequence specifies conformations, modeling of PRK and GAPDH structures has been performed. As these two proteins from the green alga C. reinhardtii have a large propensity to interact and mainly exist as a bi-enzyme complex, this entity was then studied using negative staining and cryoEM. Previous reports have shown that a mutant PRK produced by site-directed mutagenesis of Arg-64 is not capable of reforming the complex (20Avilan L. Gontero B. Lebreton S. Ricard J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 250: 296-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Therefore the basis of the interaction between GAPDH and PRK was supposed to reside in the Arg-64 region (Fig. 4, B andC). The PRK model supports the contention that this residue (and the helix B to which it belongs) may be a good candidate, because it is exposed to the solvent in the molecule. This model also shows that the Gln-189 residue (helix F′) is buried in the molecule and therefore is in good agreement to unpublished experimental data, which indicate that a mutant PRK produced by site-directed mutagenesis of Gln-189 was still able to reconstitute the complex in vitro. 2B. Gontero, personal communication. It was then tempting to fit the structures of PRK and its partner (GAPDH) into the model obtained by cryoEM and negative staining. Dimensions (20 × 10 nm) of the observed particles are in good agreement with the expected size 460 kDa of GAPDH-PRK complex (6Avilan L. Gontero B. Lebreton S. Ricard J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 246: 78-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Smaller assemblies may correspond to the partially degraded complex; this is possibly explained by the 10-fold dilution of the complex required for the negative staining, because it has been shown previously that the complex could depolymerize upon dilution. The rod-like structures may be the result of aggregated GAPDH. Indeed, GAPDH has been described as aggregated forms in plants (48Baalmann E. Scheibe R. Cerff R. Martin W. Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; 32: 505-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 49Wolosiuk R.A. Buchanan B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 6456-6461Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although the C-terminal extension of the protein that is missing in the algal enzyme seems to be responsible for the self-aggregation (48Baalmann E. Scheibe R. Cerff R. Martin W. Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; 32: 505-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), the rod-like structures observed here may also be the result of such an aggregation. The study of this possible aggregation is under investigation. The overall matrix obtained by cryoEM was tentatively used to fit the modeled structures of GAPDH and PRK. The fitting of two tetrameric GAPDH within the whole complex was straightforward (Fig. 5,A–F) and allowed the computation of a three-dimensional difference map (Fig. 5, G–I) corresponding to the space occupied by the PRK dimers (Fig. 5,J–L). In this three-dimensional subtraction map we observe four main masses (E1, E2, P1, and P2) that may each correspond to a PRK monomer. However, the scattered disposition of these masses is not compatible with the dimeric conformation of the PRK as presented in Figs. 4 C and 5, J–L. Hence, from the top view orientation of the whole complex (Fig. 5 H) masses E1-E2 and P1-P2 seem to form two dimers, but in fact they are located far apart when observed from thefront (Fig. 5H) and profile views (Fig. 5 I). Similarly, a dimeric disposition E2-P1 and E1-P2 could be inferred from Fig. 5 G but clearly not from Fig. 5,H and I. Therefore, our attempts to fit two dimers of PRK (Fig. 5, J–L) in the remaining space of the three-dimensional subtraction map (Fig. 5,G–I) were unsuccessful. One should of course keep in mind that it was not possible to model the C terminus of the algal PRK and that the most likely explanation was that within the complex, PRK quaternary structure had undergone a conformation change. Hence, a strong structural deformation is most likely the molecular basis for the activation of the PRK with the complex. These results are in good agreement with those presented in a recent review from Janin and co-workers. In this work, several examples illustrate large changes in conformations occurring within oligomeric complexes with large interfaces between components (interface area > 2000 Å2 per contact) (50Conte L.L. Chothia C. Janin J. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 2177-2198Crossref PubMed Scopus (1775) Google Scholar). Finally, the presence of additional material clearly distinct from E and P masses in the subtraction maps of Fig. 5,G–I may suggest the presence of another protein within the bi-enzyme complex. Quite recently, in C. reinhardtii, the bi-enzyme complex was shown to be associated with a third component, the so-called CP12, a protein not easily detected (14Wedel N. Soll J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9699-9704Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). This protein is therefore a good candidate to fill at least in part the space observed by the cryoEM technique, and the search of this protein is now under investigation."
https://openalex.org/W2086689785,"Phosphorylation of the inhibitory γ subunit (Pγ) of rod cGMP phosphodiesterase (PDE6) has been reported to turn off visual excitation without the requirement for inactivation of the photoreceptor G-protein transducin. We evaluated the significance of Pγ phosphorylation for PDE6 regulation by preparing Pγ stoichiometrically phosphorylated at Thr22 or at Thr35. Phosphorylation of Pγ at either residue caused a minor decrease—not the previously reported increase—in the ability of Pγ to inhibit catalysis at the active site of purified PDE6 catalytic dimers. Likewise, Pγ phosphorylation had little effect on its potency to inhibit transducin-activated PDE6 depleted of its endogenous Pγ subunits. The strength of Pγ interaction with the regulatory GAF domain of PDE6 was reduced severalfold upon Pγ phosphorylation at Thr22 (but not Thr35), as judged by allosteric changes in cGMP binding to these noncatalytic sites on the enzyme (Mou, H., and Cote, R. H. (2001) J. Biol. Chem. 276, 27527–27534). In contrast, the effects of Pγ phosphorylation on its interactions with activated transducin were much more pronounced. Phosphorylation of Pγ at either Thr22 or Thr35 greatly diminished its ability to bind activated transducin, consistent with earlier work. In situphosphorylation of Pγ by endogenous rod outer segment kinases was enhanced severalfold upon light activation, but only ∼10% of the endogenous Pγ was phosphorylated. This is attributed to Pγ being a poor substrate for protein kinases when associated with the PDE6 holoenzyme. We conclude that, contrary to previous reports, Pγ phosphorylation at either Thr22 or Thr35modestly weakens its direct interactions with PDE6. However, Pγ phosphorylation subsequent to its dissociation from PDE6 is likely to abolish its binding to activated transducin and may serve to make phosphorylated Pγ available to regulate other signal transduction pathways (e.g. mitogen-activated protein kinase; Wan, K. F., Sambi, B. S., Frame, M., Tate, R., and Pyne, N. J. (2001) J. Biol. Chem. 276, 37802–37808) in photoreceptor cells.

This leads to GTP-GDP exchange on the heterotrimeric G-protein transducin, causing dissociation of the activated αt*-GTP subunit from the βγ complex. Activated transducin then binds to and displaces the inhibitory γ subunit (Pγ) 1The abbreviations used are:Pγ9.7-kDa inhibitory γ subunit of rod PDE6PDE6cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase from photoreceptor cells (type 6)GTPγSguanosine-5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphateHPLChigh-pressure liquid chromatographyPαβcatalytic heterodimer of rod PDE6PKAprotein kinase AMAPmitogen-activated proteinROSrod outer segment(s)MALDI-TOFmatrix-assisted laser-desorption ionization time-of-flight of the effector enzyme, cyclic GMP phosphodiesterase (PDE6). PDE6 is a member of a large family of phosphodiesterases that share a conserved catalytic region but vary in substrate specificity, cellular localization, and modes of regulation (1Manganiello V.C.

The rod PDE6 holoenzyme is an oligomeric protein consisting of a catalytic dimer of two similar catalytic subunits (Pαβ) to which are bound two Pγ subunits. Activation of PDE6 leads to hydrolysis of cGMP, causing a decrease in cytoplasmic cGMP levels, ultimately resulting in hyperpolarization of the cell due to closure of cGMP-gated ion channels (5Pugh E.N., Jr. Lamb T.D. Stavenga D.G. Pugh E.N., Jr. Pugh E.N., Jr. Molecular Mechanisms in Visual Transduction. Elsevier Science B.

Its primary function in dark-adapted photoreceptors is to bind tightly to Pαβ to inhibit catalysis of PDE6, thereby maintaining micromolar levels of cGMP in the cytoplasm of the rod outer segment. This is accomplished by direct binding of the C terminus of Pγ to the active site of Pαβ (6Granovsky A.E. Natochin M. Artemyev N.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11686-11689Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The central polycationic region of Pγ provides additional sites of interaction with Pαβ (7Artemyev N.O. Hamm H.E. Biochem. J. 1992; 283: 273-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). This Pγ domain is largely responsible for the very high affinity of Pγ for Pαβ, and it allosterically regulates cGMP binding to the GAF domain (a protein domain named for its occurrence in cGMP-regulated PDEs, certain adenylate cyclases, and the bacterial protein Fh1A) on Pαβ (see Ref. 8Mou H. Cote R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27527-27534Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar and the references therein). During phototransduction, activated transducin binds to the C-terminal domain of Pγ to relieve the inhibitory constraint of Pγ at the catalytic site of PDE6 (9Lipkin V.M. Dumler I.L. Muradov K.G.

Under conditions where Pγ affinity to Pαβ is weakened (i.e.in the absence of cGMP binding to the GAF domains), the αt*-GTP-Pγ complex in amphibian ROS can dissociate from PDE6 (14Yamazaki A.

Dissociation of cGMP and release of Pγ from the PDE6 holoenzyme also correlate with another function of Pγ, namely, its ability to potentiate the GTPase-accelerating ability of the regulator of G-protein signaling-9 (RGS-9; Refs. 16Arshavsky V.Y.

Two distinct threonine residues in the central polycationic region of Pγ have been identified as targets for phosphorylation: Thr22and Thr35. Thr22 is located within a consensus sequence for proline-directed kinases (Pro-X-(Ser/Thr)-Pro), whereas Thr35 is part of a consensus sequence for protein kinase A (PKA) and related kinases (Arg-X-(Ser/Thr)). Phosphorylation at either Thr22 or Thr35 has been reported to increase the inhibitory potency of Pγ 2- to 10-fold by increasing its intrinsic binding affinity for purified Pαβ catalytic dimers (24Xu L.X.

These investigations have concluded that Pγ phosphorylation can serve to turn off light-activated PDE6 without requiring transducin inactivation by its intrinsic GTPase activity. Because of the potential importance of transducin-independent pathways for terminating and adapting the biochemical cascade of phototransduction in rod photoreceptors, we chose to examine in detail how Pγ phosphorylation might modulate PDE6 activity. We used purified PKA and MAP kinase to phosphorylate Pγ in vitro at Thr35 and Thr22, respectively, with well-defined stoichiometries of 1 phosphate/Pγ. Under conditions where the interaction of Pγ with PDE6 can be precisely determined, we find relatively minor effects of Pγ phosphorylation on its interactions with the catalytic and GAF domains of Pαβ. Likewise, we see little effect of phosphorylation on the ability of Pγ to re-inhibit transducin-activated PDE6 bound to ROS membranes. We offer explanations for the discrepancy between our results and earlier reports in the literature demonstrating large changes in Pγ binding to PDE6 upon phosphorylation. However, we are able to confirm previous results showing that Pγ phosphorylation reduces the ability of Pγ to interact with activated transducin. Finally, we present evidence that Pγ is a poor substrate for phosphorylation by protein kinases when complexed with the PDE6 holoenzyme and that the small light-induced increase in Pγ phosphorylation in ROS is unlikely to directly regulate either transducin or PDE6 during phototransduction. Bovine retinas were purchased from W. L. Lawson, Inc., and frogs (Rana catesbeiana) were obtained from Niles Biologicals. [3H]cGMP and [35S]GTPγS were purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences, and [γ-32P]ATP was from ICN Biochemicals. Filtration and ultrafiltration products were from Millipore. Scintillation fluid (Ultima Gold) was from Packard Instrument Co. Zaprinast was a gift of Rhone-Poulenc Rorer (Dagenham, United Kingdom). BCA protein assay reagent was from Pierce. All other chemicals were obtained from Sigma. Superdex 200 and Mono-Q columns were from Amersham Biosciences, Inc., and the C18 reversed phase column (300A, 22 × 250 mm) was from Vydac. PKA, MAP kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase 2, and P-81 phosphocellulose membranes were from Upstate Biotechnology. The Pγ mutants used in this study were kind gifts of Drs. N. O. Artemyev (PγT22C and PγT35C) and N. P. Skiba (Pγ1–45C). Intact frog ROS were purified on a discontinuous Percoll density gradient as described previously (30Cote R.H. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 315: 646-672Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Purified ROS were homogenized at 4 °C in ROS buffer containing 77 mm KCl, 35 mm NaCl, 1.0 mm CaCl2, 2.0 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm4-(2-aminoethyl)benzene-sulfonyl fluoride, 5 μmleupeptin, and 1 μg/ml pepstatin. Homogenized ROS were incubated in the dark at room temperature for 30 min to deplete endogenous nucleotides. The rhodopsin concentration was determined by difference spectroscopy (31Bownds D. Gordon-Walker A. Gaide Huguenin A.C. Robinson W. J. Gen. Physiol. 1971; 58: 225-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The concentration of PDE6 was determined either by measuring the maximum cGMP hydrolytic activity of trypsin-activated PDE6 using the turnover number (k cat) of 7550 mol cGMP hydrolyzed/s/mol PDE6 (15Norton A.W. D'Amours M.R. Grazio H.J. Hebert T.L. Cote R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38611-38619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) or by determining the ability of PDE6 to bind 2 mol cGMP/mol PDE6 (30Cote R.H. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 315: 646-672Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Pγ-depleted frog ROS membranes were prepared as described previously (30Cote R.H. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 315: 646-672Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) by incubating nucleotide-depleted, light-exposed ROS homogenates with GTPγS (∼1 GTPγS/rhodopsin) at 4 °C for 1 h. After centrifugation (110,000 × g for 2 min), the membranes were resuspended with GTPγS and incubated for ≥2 h at 4 °C. After the second centrifugation, the Pγ-depleted ROS membranes retained 25–40% of the original Pγ content. Purified frog Pαβ was prepared by limited trypsinization of ROS membranes with l-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone-treated trypsin, followed by the addition of a 6-fold molar excess of soybean trypsin inhibitor (30Cote R.H. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 315: 646-672Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The time course of frog PDE6 activation was empirically determined in each experiment to minimize exposure to the protease. The recombinant bovine rod full-length Pγ and Pγ mutants were expressed using the pET11a expression plasmid in the host strainEscherichia coli BL21 DE3. The mutants PγT22C and PγT35C both had a substitution of Ser at Cys68 of the bovine rod Pγ sequence, in addition to a Cys substitution for the naturally occurring Thr at positions 22 or 35, respectively (32Granovsky A.E. McEntaffer R. Artemyev N.O. Cell Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 28: 115-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The Pγ1–45C mutant was truncated at position 45, and a C-terminal Cys was introduced (13Skiba N.P. Bae H. Hamm H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 413-424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Expression and purification conditions were identical to those described previously (33Mou H. Grazio H.J. Cook T.A. Beavo J.A. Cote R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18813-18820Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The concentrations of purified Pγ, PγT22C, PγT35C, and Pγ1–45C were measured spectrophotometrically at 277 nm with an extinction coefficient of 7550 cm·m−1 (30Cote R.H. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 315: 646-672Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or with a colorimetric protein assay using bovine serum albumin as a standard (34Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K.

The inhibitory activity of each full-length Pγ preparation was verified to agree to ≤20% with the spectrophotometric estimate of the Pγ concentration by measuring inhibition of trypsin-activated PDE6 (3–5 nm) (see Fig. 1; Ref. 30Cote R.H. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 315: 646-672Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Pγ18–41 and two singly phosphorylated peptides (Pγ18–41(22P) and Pγ18–41(35P)) were synthesized at the Protein Facility in the Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology at the University of New Hampshire. Cleavage of peptides from the resin and protecting groups was accomplished with anhydrous hydrofluoric acid. The peptides were first purified with cation exchange chromatography on CM-Sephadex C25, which was equilibrated with 1 mm NH4HCO3, pH 8.0, and eluted with a linear 0–1.0 mNH4HCO3 gradient. After ion exchange chromatography, the peptides were further purified with a preparative C18 reverse-phase column (300A, 22 × 250 mm) using a linear gradient of 30–70% acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. The dried peptides were resuspended in 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, and the concentration was measured by the BCA protein assay. Other synthetic peptides reported in this study have been described previously (8Mou H. Cote R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27527-27534Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Membrane-associated bovine rod PDE6 was prepared from frozen bovine retinas and purified by using the ion exchange, immunoaffinity, and gel filtration chromatography procedures described previously (33Mou H. Grazio H.J. Cook T.A. Beavo J.A. Cote R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18813-18820Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Bovine Pαβ was prepared by limited trypsin proteolysis, and Pγ fragments were removed by Mono-Q chromatography or Superdex 200 gel filtration chromatography (33Mou H. Grazio H.J. Cook T.A. Beavo J.A. Cote R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18813-18820Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation assays were performed in a phosphorylation reaction buffer containing 20 mm3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid, pH 7.2, 25 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm EGTA, 15 mm MgCl2, and 100 μm ATP (with or without 1.0 μCi/μl [γ-32P]ATP). Phosphorylation was initiated at room temperature by adding PKA (50 ng kinase/μg protein) or MAP kinase (100 ng kinase/μg protein) to the reaction mixture containing Pγ, Pγ peptides, or purified bovine PDE6 holoenzyme. Phosphorylation by [γ-32P]ATP was quantified by spotting samples onto P-81 phosphocellulose membranes (35Roskoski R., Jr. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 99: 3-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar). Once stoichiometric incorporation was reached, the kinase activity was quenched by heating the samples at 70 °C for 5 min. Incorporation of phosphate into Pγ was confirmed by matrix-assisted laser-desorption ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry at the Molecular Biology Core Facilities (Dana Farber Cancer Institute) with a Perceptive Biosystems Voyager DE-STR mass spectrometer operated at 20,000 V. Collection of data was performed in the positive ion mode utilizing α-cyano-4-hydroxy-trans-cinnamic acid as the matrix. Proteolytic digestion of phosphorylated, recombinant bovine Pγ (100 μg) with endoproteinase Lys C (1:40, w/w) or trypsin (1:50, w/w) was carried out at room temperature for 12 h in 100 mmTris HCl, pH 8.5. Fragments were then separated by reversed-phase HPLC using a 0–100% linear gradient of acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Fractions were assayed for radioactivity and assigned to their corresponding peaks on the HPLC chromatogram. Nonradioactive samples treated in an identical manner were also analyzed by MALDI-TOF. The molecular ion masses of the peptide fragments generated by proteolytic digestion were matched with values obtained by theoretical digestion patterns generated by PeptideMass (36Wilkins M.R. Lindskog I. Gasteiger E. Bairoch A. Sanchez J.C. Hochstrasser D.F. Appel R.D. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 403-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Frog ROS homogenates (50 μm rhodopsin) were incubated in ROS buffer containing 100 μm [γ-32P]ATP under nonactivated (dark-adapted, no GTPγS) or activated (light-exposed, 100 μm GTPγS) conditions in the presence of 25 mm β-glycerol phosphate and 1 mm sodium orthovanadate. Soluble Pγ was separated from ROS membranes by first centrifuging the homogenate (3 min at 110,000 × g). The supernatant portion was assayed for Pγ content, whereas the ROS membrane pellet was resuspended in 40% acetonitrile/0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. After heating at 80 °C for 5 min, the resuspended membrane fraction was centrifuged again. Samples were injected onto an analytical C-4 reversed-phase HPLC column, and proteins were resolved with a 20–100% acetonitrile/0.1% trifluoroacetic acid linear gradient. The column fractions were assayed for radioactivity and Pγ concentration (based on the ability of Pγ to inhibit Pαβ). The stoichiometry of phosphorylation was calculated based on the amount of 32P incorporation relative to the total Pγ in the sample. To confirm that Pγ was the only phosphoprotein in these fractions, the fractions were lyophilized, resuspended in SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and electrophoresed on 15% acrylamide gels (37Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 277: 680-685Crossref Scopus (207472) Google Scholar). After transfer onto nitrocellulose membranes, autoradiography was performed for 12–24 h at −80 °C. In some cases, the membrane was rehydrated and processed for immunoblot analysis of Pγ as described previously (30Cote R.H. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 315: 646-672Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). PDE6 hydrolytic activity was measured by either colorimetric or radiotracer assays as described recently (30Cote R.H. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 315: 646-672Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The equilibrium binding and kinetics of [3H]cGMP association with PDE6 were measured with a filter binding assay exactly as described previously (30Cote R.H. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 315: 646-672Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Binding of [35S]GTPγS to activated transducin was performed as described previously (38Fung B.K.K. Hurley J.B. Stryer L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 152-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar). All experiments were performed at least three times. Fitting of the data was performed using nonlinear regression analysis (Sigmaplot; SPSS, Inc.), using the curve-fitting function described in the figure legends. To determine the effect of Pγ phosphorylation on PDE6 activation and recovery, we first needed to prepare in vitro phosphorylated Pγ at defined sites. Using the catalytic subunit of PKA, we were able to incorporate 1.0 ± 0.2 mol of phosphate into recombinant, purified Pγ. We saw no evidence for a second site of phosphorylation, even with extensive incubations with the kinase (Fig.1 A). MALDI-TOF analysis of full-length Pγ phosphorylated with PKA yielded a single species with an average molecular ion mass of 9750 ± 1.7 Da, a shift of 80 Da (the mass of a single phosphate group) compared with nonphosphorylated Pγ (9669 ± 1.0 Da). The site of incorporation of phosphate into Pγ by PKA was unequivocally determined to be Thr35 based on the following results: (a) incorporation of 32P into Pγ was greatly reduced when Thr35 was substituted with cysteine, whereas stoichiometric Pγ phosphorylation was observed when Thr22 was substituted with cysteine (Fig. 1 A); (b) a synthetic peptide comprising amino acids 21–46 of Pγ was able to incorporate 32P, whereas central region peptides lacking Thr35 or its neighboring residues were unable to be phosphorylated by PKA (data not shown); (c) proteolytic digestion of full-length Pγ with endoproteinase Lys C generates a peptide fragment consisting of residues 32–39 (QRQTRQFK; predicted molecular ion mass of 1091.7 Da), and when the proteolytic fragments of PKA-phosphorylated Pγ were analyzed, we observed an 80-Da shift in molecular ion mass (1171.5 Da) of this peptide; and (d) digestion of full-length Pγ with trypsin also reveals an 80-Da shift (688.4 to 768.4 Da) in the peptide containing residues 32–36 (QRQTR). We conclude that PKA catalyzes the stoichiometric incorporation of phosphate only into Thr35 under our experimental conditions, in agreement with the findings of Xu et al.(24Xu L.X. Tanaka Y. Bonderenko V.A. Matsuura I. Matsumoto H. Yamazaki A. Hayashi F. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 6205-6213Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). To prepare Pγ phosphorylated at Thr22, we used MAP kinase because its substrate specificity (Pro-X-(Thr/Ser)-Pro; Ref.39Stokoe D. Campbell D.G. Nakielny S. Hidaka H. Leevers S.J. Marshall C. Cohen P. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3985-3994Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar) is identical to the residues surrounding Thr22(Pro20-Val21-Thr22-Pro23). Under the conditions shown in Fig. 1 B, 1.0 ± 0.2 mol of phosphate was incorporated into Pγ. MALDI-TOF analysis of MAP kinase-phosphorylated Pγ confirmed stoichiometric incorporation of phosphate, with an average molecular ion mass of 9750 ± 1.2 Da under these conditions. 2With higher enzyme concentrations or longer incubations, >1 mol phosphate/mol Pγ was detected by MALDI-TOF and32P incorporation. The site of this second phosphorylation event has yet to be determined. All MAP kinase-phosphorylated Pγ preparations used in this study were phosphorylated under the conditions described for Fig. 1 (0.7–1.1 mol phosphate/mol Pγ), and the site of phosphorylation was identified as exclusively Thr22. The site of Pγ phosphorylation catalyzed by MAP kinase was ascertained to be Thr22 based on the following observations: (a) the Pγ mutant in which Thr22was replaced with cysteine failed to incorporate significant amounts of32P compared with wild-type Pγ or Pγ substituted at Thr35 with a cysteine residue (Fig. 1 B); (b) synthetic peptides consisting of amino acid residues 10–30 or 15–26 of Pγ can both be phosphorylated by MAP kinase (but at a reduced rate), whereas synthetic peptides lacking amino acids 20–23 failed to incorporate 32P (data not shown); (c) MALDI-TOF analysis of endoproteinase Lys C fragments of Pγ showed that the fragment containing amino acid residues 8–25 (AEIRSATRVMGGPVTPRK) increased in molecular ion mass by 80 Da (1927.3 to 2007.3 Da) upon Pγ ph"

Subcellular fractionation analysis, immunostaining, and electron microscopy demonstrated endosomal localization of the fusion protein. According to pulse-labeling and cross-linking studies Scavidin is found as monomers (55 kDa), dimers, and multimers, of which the 220-kDa form was the most abundant. The biotin binding capacity and active endocytosis of the biotinylated ligands were demonstrated in rat malignant glioma. Local Scavidin gene transfer to target tissues could have general utility as a universal tool to deliver biotinylated molecules at systemic low concentrations for therapeutic and imaging purposes, whereby high local concentration is achieved.

One possibility for targeting is to use the very high binding affinity of avidin for biotin. The binding is almost irreversible (K d10−15/m). Here we report the construction of a novel fusion protein (Scavidin) for targeting biotinylated molecules to specific tissues. Biotin can be combined to almost any type of molecule through its valeric acid side chain without affecting the biological properties of the molecules (1Wilchek M. Bayer E.A. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 171: 1-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (798) Google Scholar, 2Richards F.M. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 184: 3-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). This established chemistry allows covalent biotinylation of drugs, liposomes, radiopharmaceuticals, and other ligands. The fusion protein was generated from the macrophage scavenger receptor class A (MSR-A)1 (3Kodama T. Freeman M. Rohrer L. Zabrecky J. Matsudaira P. Krieger M. Nature. 1990; 343: 531-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (840) Google Scholar) and avidin (4Green R.M. Adv. Protein Chem. 1975; 29: 85-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (1596) Google Scholar). MSR-A belongs to a large family of scavenger receptors, which participate in endocytosis of various ligands, cell adhesion, and defense against microorganisms (5de Winther M.P. van Dijk K.W. Havekes L.M. Hofker M.H. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2000; 20: 290-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). The C-terminal domain and collagen-like domain containing the ligand-binding site (6Andersson L. Freeman M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19592-19601Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) have been removed from the fusion protein. The cytoplasmic domain containing signals for endocytosis, transmembrane domain, and α-helical coiled coil domain have been retained. These domains are sufficient to transport the receptor to the cell membrane and mediate endocytosis of ligands. Avidin, which permits targeted binding of biotinylated ligands, is located extracellularly at the C terminus. In the present study, we demonstrate the functionality of Scavidin fusion proteinin vitro and in vivo in rat glioma cells. The Scavidin provides a promising new tool for targeted delivery of biotinylated ligands for local gene and drug therapy and diagnostic applications. The avidin cDNA was generated by 25 cycles of PCR amplification using the following primers: forward, 5′-CC CGG CCA AGG TGC CAG AAA GTG CTC GCT G-3′; reverse, 5′-TG GCT CCT TGG TCA CTC ACT CAC TCC TTC TGT GTG CG-3′. Amplified avidin cDNA was joined into the StyI site in MSR-A cDNA after the α-helical coiled coil structure-coding domain and before the collagenous domain in a retrovirus plasmid, pLScARNL (7Lehtolainen P. Takeya M. Yla-Herttuala S. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2000; 20: 52-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The fusion protein was named Scavidin® (registered UK trademark of Ark Therapeutics, Ltd.). Plasmid sequences were verified by sequencing (A. L. F. DNA sequenator, Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). The same vector backbone containing LacZ cDNA (Bag) (8Price J. Turner D. Cepko C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 156-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (751) Google Scholar) was used as a control (Fig. 1). Packaging cell lines were transfected with retroviral plasmids (pLScARNL or pBag containing LacZ) using the standard calcium phosphate precipitation method as described (7Lehtolainen P. Takeya M. Yla-Herttuala S. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2000; 20: 52-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 9Ylä-Herttuala S. Luoma J. Viita H. Hiltunen T. Sisto T. Nikkari T. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 2692-2698Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) and were used to transduce BT4C glioma cells (10Sandmair A.M. Turunen M. Tyynela K. Loimas S. Vainio P. Vanninen R. Vapalahti M. Bjerkvig R. Janne J. Yla-Herttuala S. Cancer Gene Ther. 2000; 7: 413-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). After 10–12 days of selection with G418 (400 μg/ml, Sigma) resistant BT4C cells were expanded and selected by the biotin binding capacity with fluorescence-activated cell sorting. Poly(A)+ mRNA (1 μg) was isolated using the SDS/proteinase K method, electrophoresed in a denaturating gel, transferred to nylon membrane (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.), and hybridized with random-primed32P-labeled probes. Autoradiography was used for signal detection. 200 μg of protein from Scavidin cells was run in reducing 4–7.5% SDS-PAGE and blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes (1 h, 100 V, 160 mA). Membranes were incubated with an anti-avidin antibody (Sigma, 1:4000) and a secondary antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (HRP, 1:3000). Chemiluminescence (with SuperSignal™ substrate, Pierce) was used for signal detection. Proteins in Scavidin and LacZ-transduced cells were cross-linked withN-hydroxysuccinimide esters (disuccinimidyl suberate, (bis)sulfosuccinimidyl suberate, Pierce) for 1 h at room temperature and quenched for 30 min with 50 mm Tris buffer on ice. Cells were collected by scraping and lysed in 1% Triton X-100. Supernatants were separated by centrifugation (25,000 ×g, 10 min) and subjected to 8.5% SDS-PAGE. The nitrocellulose filter was reacted with rabbit anti-avidin and anti-rabbit-HRP conjugate (Bio-Rad). The signal was detected by chemiluminescence (with SuperSignal™ Substrate, Pierce). Monolayers of Scavidin cells were washed with medium without methionine, pulse-labeled for 5, 10, 20, and 40 min with [35S]Met-Cys (500 μCi/ml) medium, and either immediately harvested by lysis on ice or chased for the indicated time periods in a medium supplemented with unlabeled methionine (1.5 mg/ml) before the lysis. Scavidin was immunoprecipitated at 4 °C with anti-avidin antibody in 20% BSA overnight, bound to protein A-Sepharose for 1 h, and collected by centrifugation. SDS-PAGE sample buffer (with 10% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol) was added, and protein A-Sepharose/Scavidin interactions were dissociated at 100 °C for 5 min. Samples were separated in 5–15% gradient SDS-PAGE gel. Fractionation of the cells was performed as described earlier (11Griffiths G. Matteoni R. Back R. Hoflack B. J. Cell Sci. 1990; 95: 441-461Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, stable BT4C/Scavidin cells were pulsed for 5 min at 37 °C in the 10% fetal bovine serum/Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 2 mg/ml HRP in the 10% Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and washed with ice-cold BSA (5 mg/ml) in PBS on ice. Cells were harvested by scraping and homogenized in Percoll buffer (3 mm imidazole, 0.25 msucrose, 1 mm EDTA), and nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation (2000 rpm, 10 min). The supernatant was homogenized by passing the cells several times through a 23-gauge needle in Percoll buffer to a final concentration of 20% (v/v) Percoll and 0.4 mg/ml BSA and were layered onto a 1-ml cushion of 2.5 m sucrose. After centrifugation (2 h, 30,000 × g, 4 °C) fractions were collected, beginning from the bottom of the tube, and assayed for enzyme activities. β-Hexosaminidase (present in lysosomes and to a lesser extent in late endosomes) was assayed withp-nitrophenyl-N-acetyl-β-d-glucosaminide (12Punnonen E.L. Marjomäki V.S. Reunanen H. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 65: 14-25PubMed Google Scholar) and endocytosed HRP (present in early endosomes) witho-dianisidine as a substrate (11Griffiths G. Matteoni R. Back R. Hoflack B. J. Cell Sci. 1990; 95: 441-461Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Proteins were run in 8.5% SDS-PAGE gel, blotted onto nitrocellulose membrane, and reacted with rabbit anti-avidin and anti-rabbit-HRP conjugate (Bio-Rad). The signal was detected by chemiluminescence (with SuperSignal™ substrate, Pierce). Scavidin-expressing BT4C cells were grown on coverslips and labeled with anti-avidin antibody for 1 h on ice. Cells were washed with ice-cold 0.1 mphosphate buffer (pH 7.4) and labeled with 10-nm protein A-gold particles (G. Posthuma and J. Slott, Utrecht, the Netherlands) (13Slot J.W. Geuze H.J. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 38: 87-93PubMed Google Scholar) for 1 h on ice. Samples were incubated for 15 min at 37 °C. The cells were fixed for 1 h at 4 °C with 2.5% glutaraldehyde (in 0.1 m PBS) and then with 1% osmium tetroxide (in 0.1m PBS). After dehydration, cells were stained with 2% uranyl acetate for 30 min at room temperature, embedded in Epon, and sectioned for electron microscopy. Scavidi-expressing BT4C cells and LacZ/BT4C control cells were incubated with 10 μg/ml biotinylated IgG (b-IgG, 1:200, Dako). To follow the uptake of the ligand, cells were incubated with biotinylated ligand for 30 min at 4 °C on ice, washed, and chased in fresh medium without the ligand for 2, 15, and 30 min at 37 °C. Cells were fixed in methanol for 6 min at −20 °C and blocked for 1 h with 2% BSA before antibody staining. Antibodies were used at the following dilutions. Primary antibodies: monoclonal goat anti-avidin, 1:200 (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) and polyclonal rabbit anti-cation-independent mannose 6-phosphate receptor (CI-MPR) 1:100. Secondary antibodies: fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled swine anti-rabbit IgG, 1:40 (Dako); tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate-labeled donkey anti-rabbit IgG, 1:40; Alexa Fluor 546-labeled donkey anti-goat IgG 1:250 (Molecular Probes). After washings, samples were incubated for 30 min with secondary antibodies diluted in PBS, washed, and mounted in Mowiol (Calbiochem). Samples were examined using a confocal microscope (Zeiss Microsystems; LSM-510 software with PhotoShop 4.0). Ex vivo stably transduced BT4C Scavidin cells or LacZ cells (as a control) were implanted intracranially in the right corpus callosum at the depth of 2.5 mm in inbred BDIX female rats (Netherlands) as described (10Sandmair A.M. Turunen M. Tyynela K. Loimas S. Vainio P. Vanninen R. Vapalahti M. Bjerkvig R. Janne J. Yla-Herttuala S. Cancer Gene Ther. 2000; 7: 413-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The Scavidin functionality in vivo was tested with biotinylated horseradish peroxidase (biotinylated HRP, Pierce) in rat glioma model. After 2 weeks of inoculations of stably transfected Scavidin-expressing BT4C cells or a week from the pseudotyped Scavidin or LacZ-containing retrovirus vector inoculations, rats received 10 μl of 1 mg/ml biotinylated HRP in 0.9% NaCl, injected into a depth of 2.5 mm at the site of cell inoculations or virus inoculation. After 30 min, animals were sacrificed and perfusion-fixed (see below). The anesthetized rats were perfused with 1× PBS by a transcardiac route for 10 min followed by fixation with 4% paraformaldehyde (pH 7.4) for 10 min (14Sandmair A.M. Loimas S. Puranen P. Immonen A. Kossila M. Puranen M. Hurskainen H. Tyynela K. Turunen M. Vanninen R. Lehtolainen P. Paljarvi L. Johansson R. Vapalahti M. Yla-Herttuala S. Hum. Gene Ther. 2000; 11: 2197-2205Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Tissue samples were rinsed in 1× PBS and embedded in OCT compound (Miles Scientific, Elkhart, IN). The goat anti-avidin antibody (1:250, Vector Laboratories) was used for immunostainings. The sections were counterstained with hematoxylin. An avidin-biotin-HRP system (Vector Elite, Vector Laboratories) was used for signal detection. The bound biotinylated HRP was detected from the sections by direct DAB staining. The LacZ activity was analyzed with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (X-gal; Sigma) staining. The Scavidin fusion protein was constructed in a retroviral vector as described under “Experimental Procedures” (Fig. 1). A full-length mRNA encoding Scavidin was produced in transfected cells (Fig. 2 a). 110-kDa dimers and 55–60-kDa monomers were detected from retrovirus-transfected cells (Fig. 2 b). Size was calculated according to the molecular mass of the non-glycosylated monomeric Scavidin, which is 45 kDa. From the previously known quaternary structure of MSR-A it was anticipated that Scavidin fusion protein forms trimers (from non-covalently associated disulfide cross-linked dimers at Cys-83) and monomers (15Penman M. Lux A. Freedman N.J. Rohrer L. Ekkel Y. McKinstry H. Resnick D. Krieger M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23985-23993Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Instead, in cross-linking studies, the strongest signal was from a 220-kDa protein, which was denaturated to a 110-kDa dimer and a 55-kDa monomer suggesting the formation of tetramers instead of trimers (Fig.2 c). These results indicate that the avidin moiety remains soluble and is capable of forming multimers, such as tetramers, even when attached to MSR-A. However, the results do not rule out the existence of trimers since a band of ∼170 kDa was seen in both acetylation and cross-linking studies. To study the synthesis and degradation of the Scavidin protein, the cells were pulse-labeled with [35S]methionine and then immediately processed or chased for the indicated time periods (Fig. 2,d–f). Scavidin protein remained stable for at least 10 h of chase, and only one-third of the protein was degraded. Monomers were already seen after 5 min of chase. The lower molecular mass monomers disappeared by 3 h. The conversion of monomers into dimers and multimers occurred within 40 min. The intensity of the dimers and multimers increased within 3 h of chase simultaneously with the decrease in the intensities of monomers. Multiple bands are likely to represent different glycosylated forms of Scavidin. All of the dimers and multimers were denaturated into monomers in the presence of 2-mercaptoethanol (Fig. 2 e). The intracellular localization of the Scavidin fusion protein was determined using subcellular fractionation of Scavidin-expressing BT4C cells in a Percoll gradient (Fig. 3 a). Cells were also allowed to endocytose HRP for 5 min in order to label early endosomes. Comparison of Scavidin distribution in fractions, analyzed by autoradiography to the distribution of subcellular markers β-hexosaminidase and HRP (Fig. 3 b), revealed that Scavidin fusion protein was mainly located in the vesicular structures consisting of early endosomes. Only small amounts of Scavidin were observed in the dense fraction, rich in β-hexosaminidase. Thus, in steady state the Scavidin protein was not transported to the lysosomes. Electron microscopy revealed Scavidin expression on the cell surface after incubation with anti-avidin antibody labeled by 10 nm of protein A-gold particles (Fig. 3 c). In addition to cell fractionation studies, the vesicular localization of Scavidin fusion protein was demonstrated by immunoelectron microscopy 15 min after internalization of antibody/protein A-gold particles (Fig. 3,d and e). The Scavidin protein was detected by anti-avidin antibody staining in BT4C cells using fluorescence microscopy. Abundant protein in the cytoplasm was detected as granular structures (Fig.4 a). The protein was not uniformly distributed in the cells, but the perinuclear region was most intensively stained. To study the biotin binding and endocytosis capacity of the Scavidin fusion protein, Scavidin-transduced BT4C cells were incubated with b-IgG as a ligand and analyzed by fluorescence microscopy (Fig. 4, c–h). We found partial colocalization with CI-MPR suggesting that at least a fraction of the Scavidin/b-IgG is translocated to late endosomes. Endocytosis of b-IgG was followed up from 5 to 30 min in the BT4C cells. Before the follow-up, the cells were incubated with the ligand on ice, under conditions were no endocytosis occurs, and washed well to remove unbound ligand. After a 5-min chase without the ligand, immunoreactivity was found in numerous vesicles randomly distributed through the cytoplasm (Fig. 4,c–e). After 15 min, the ligand had accumulated in the perinuclear region (Fig. 4, f–h). The distribution pattern showed clear colocalization with the CI-MPR antibody, which was detected in the juxtanuclear area (Fig. 4 h). No significant binding of b-IgG was seen in the LacZ-transduced BT4C control cells (Fig. 4 b). Rat malignant glioma cells were transduced with VSV-G pseudotyped retroviruses containing the Scavidin or LacZ cDNA ex vivo and implanted in the rat brain followed by intratumoral delivery of biotinylated HRP (1 mg/ml) for 10 min. 30 min after the injection of biotinylated HRP rats were sacrificed and analyzed by immunohistochemistry. Scavidin was expressed on an average of 20% of the transduced cells in the rat malignant glioma tumors (Fig.5 a) as detected with anti-avidin immunostaining. No anti-avidin reactivity or specific binding of the biotinylated HRP was found in control animals having LacZ-transduced tumors (Fig. 5, c and d). Instead, binding of the biotinylated HRP was seen in the same tumor area where Scavidin immunoreactivity was detected (Fig. 5, eand f) confirming the ability of the Scavidin fusion protein to bind biotinylated ligands in vivo. Targeting of therapeutic compounds to specific cells or tissues is of great interest for the drug development. Targeting increases the concentration of therapeutic or diagnostic agents as compared with non-targeted tissues and reduces side effects in non-target tissues. Several in vivo studies have shown promising results of avidin and streptavidin-directed biotinylated monoclonal antibodies (16Breitz H.B. Weiden P.L. Beaumier P.L. Axworthy D.B. Seiler C. Su F.M. Graves S. Bryan K. Reno J.M. J. Nucl. Med. 2000; 41: 131-140PubMed Google Scholar, 17Penichet M.L. Kang Y.S. Pardridge W.M. Morrison S.L. Shin S.U. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 4421-4426PubMed Google Scholar). For instance, the “pretarget” technology based on antibody-avidin/streptavidin conjugates, which target radionuclides to tumors, has been successfully used in man without significant toxicity (18Axworthy D.B. Reno J.M. Hylarides M.D. Mallett R.W. Theodore L.J. Gustavson L.M. Su F. Hobson L.J. Beaumier P.L. Fritzberg A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1802-1807Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). In this study, we generated a Scavidin fusion protein that is expressed on plasma membrane and is capable of high-affinity binding and endocytosis of biotinylated molecules. Utilization of a transmembrane protein that mediates endocytosis of the ligands bound to avidin offers a valuable tool for the use of a broad spectrum of biotinylated molecules both in in vivo marking trials and in the treatment of various diseases, such as cancer, vascular diseases, and inflammatory diseases. This would be achieved by local gene transfer of the target tissue with the Scavidin gene construct, followed by intravenous administration of the biotinylated drug. Avidin-biotin technology has shown its promise in improving the efficiency of gene delivery into cells by using transferrin-streptavidin-DNA-conjugated vectors in mice (19Sato Y. Yamauchi N. Takahashi M. Sasaki K. Fukaura J. Neda H. Fujii S. Hirayama M. Itoh Y. Koshita Y. Kogawa K. Kato J. Sakamaki S. Niitsu Y. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 2108-2118Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Also, the interaction of avidin with biotin could be utilized in targeting biotin-coated vectors and liposomes to specific sites of tissues after local gene transfer of Scavidin. Scavidin fusion protein was translated into a functional proteinin vitro and in vivo. According to the protein analysis, the most abundant form of Scavidin was an ∼220-kDa multimer. This protein was 2-mercaptoethanol-sensitive, dissociating into 110-kDa dimers. This was anticipated, based on the knowledge of the MSR-A quaternary structure indicating that disulfide (Cys-83) cross-linked dimers and monomers non-covalently associate to form Scavidin trimers (15Penman M. Lux A. Freedman N.J. Rohrer L. Ekkel Y. McKinstry H. Resnick D. Krieger M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23985-23993Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, tetramerization may be favored because of the fact that avidin forms tetramers composed of two structural units (4Green R.M. Adv. Protein Chem. 1975; 29: 85-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (1596) Google Scholar, 20Airenne K.J. Oker-Blom C. Marjomaki V.S. Bayer E.A. Wilchek M. Kulomaa M.S. Protein Expression Purif. 1997; 9: 100-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), whose association is very tight and can force two dimeric Scavidin molecules to tetramerize at their avidin domains. Also, the triple helix-stabilizing sequences, which locate in the collagenous domain of MSR-A, were excluded from the Scavidin fusion protein (21Anachi R.B. Siegel D.L. Baum J. Brodsky B. FEBS Lett. 1995; 368: 551-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Recent construction of dimeric and monomeric avidins (22Laitinen O.H. Marttila A.T. Airenne K.J. Kulik T. Livnah O. Bayer E.A. Wilchek M. Kulomaa M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8219-8224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) will further broaden the potential uses of avidin fusion proteins. Targeting to the plasma membrane or inner organelles via transcytosis and endocytosis can be achieved by modulating the K mvalue. With the aid of the dimeric avidin moiety, which shows lower and reversible biotin binding, acid-dissociable ligands could be released from endosomes and transported to cellular compartments of interest, such as the nucleus. Utilization of the different oligomerization states of avidin will allow further possibilities for generating a broad spectrum of fusion proteins with different characteristics. It is also noteworthy that Scavidin is relatively stable (t 12 ≥10 h) in cells. Tetramerization of the fusion protein might be a stabilizing factor, as it is with avidin (22Laitinen O.H. Marttila A.T. Airenne K.J. Kulik T. Livnah O. Bayer E.A. Wilchek M. Kulomaa M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8219-8224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The electron microscopy study revealed that Scavidin was expressed on cell membranes and on the newly formed vesicles. We also demonstrated the functionality of Scavidin in mediating endocytosis: biotinylated IgG was detectable in the endocytic compartment of the cells, which serves as a route for introducing therapeutic compounds into the cells. More importantly, the functionality of Scavidin was demonstratedin vivo in the rat glioma model using biotinylated HRP as a ligand. The binding of biotinylated ligand was seen in the areas of Scavidin expression. This indicated that Scavidin could be used as a targeting molecule for various biotinylated ligands. In cancer therapy, there is an increasing interest in eliminating tumor cells by the use of biotinylated antibodies that are targeted to unique tumor antigens, followed by delivery of biotinylated therapeutic agents via avidin (17Penichet M.L.

These studies have shown that avidin-biotin-based therapies are generally well tolerated and that they facilitate targeting of therapeutic or diagnostic compounds in experimental animals and in man (23Corti A.

Because of the cross-reactivity with epitopes in tissues, the benefit gained from an improvement in the therapeutic window of cytotoxic drugs by conjugation with antibodies has often been compromised by concerns of toxicity. An important limitation of these approaches is that they require engineering of unique chimeric molecules for each specific application or tumor type. Scavidin overcomes these problems by the use of a fusion protein targeting system, which only requires two steps: Scavidin gene transfer into the target tissue and a biotinylated drug. The elimination of the antibody-step and the local gene delivery by using Scavidin gene transfer enhance the possibility of a true targeted therapeutic effect. The development of better vectors, tissue-specific promoters and regulated gene expression systems will further increase the potential of Scavidin-mediated therapy. In summary, we have demonstrated that biotinylated molecules can be targeted using the Scavidin fusion protein and that the targeted ligands are efficiently endocytosed. The Scavidin fusion protein is a promising new tool for in vivo targeting offering the possibility of enhanced local effect and decreased systemic exposure of therapeutic compounds.

The promoter of the gene coding for this subunit was characterized. A proximal region (from −99 to −64) was responsible for the transcriptional activity observed in chromaffin, C2C12, and COS cells. Within this region twocis-acting elements that bind transcription factors Sp1 and NF-Y were identified.

The human β4 promoter, that was also characterized, shared structural and functional homologies with the bovine promoter. Thus, two adjacent binding elements for Sp1 and NF-Y were detected.

Neurosci. 1993; 16: 403-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (935) Google Scholar) has suggested that complex transcriptional mechanisms direct nAChR expression. Moreover, potential changes in subunit transcription in response to modulation of synaptic function, might have important consequences on the signals transduced by nAChRs (4McGehee D.S. Role L.W.

For these reasons considerable effort has been dedicated to the elucidation of the molecular basis for the transcriptional regulation of neuronal nAChRs, and thus severalcis- and trans-acting elements in the promoter of the different nAChRs subunits have been identified (6Fornasari D.

In our laboratory we have previously isolated and characterized the promoters of the bovine α5 (7Campos-Caro A. Carrasco-Serrano C. Valor L.M. Viniegra S. Ballesta J.J. Criado M. J. Biol.

These subunits are expressed in the chromaffin cells of the adrenal gland composing two different receptor subtypes, one of them formed by α7 subunits (9Garcı́a-Guzmán M. Sala F. Sala S.

We have analyzed here the bovine and human β4 promoters, finding that they are highly homologous in their proximal regions as well as in thecis-elements governing basal transcriptional activity. Although their sequences differ from the one of the rat β4 promoter (14Bigger C.B. Casanova E.A. Gardner P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32842-32848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 15Bigger C.B. Melnikova I.N. Gardner P.D. J. Biol.

Binding motifs for Sp1 have been also located in close proximity in the promoters of rat α3 (16Yang X. Fyodorov D. Deneris E.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8514-8520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) and bovine (7Campos-Caro A. Carrasco-Serrano C. Valor L.M. Viniegra S. Ballesta J.J. Criado M. J. Biol.

Neurochem. 2000; 75: 18-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) α5 subunits, suggesting that this transcription factor plays a fundamental role in the expression of several nAChRs subunit genes. For the bovine promoter a cDNA probe corresponding to 218 bp at the beginning of the coding sequence and the contiguous 38 bp of 5′-untranslated region (10Campos-Caro A. Smillie F. Domı́nguez del Toro E. Rovira J.C. Vicente-Agulló F. Chapuli J. Juı́z J.M. Sala S. Sala F. Ballesta J.J. Criado M. J. Neurochem. 1997; 68: 488-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) was used to screen a genomic library. For the human promoter, a cDNA probe corresponding to 87 bp at the beginning of the coding sequence and the contiguous 99 bp of 5′-untranslated region (18Kormelink P.J.G. Luyten W.H.M.L. FEBS Lett. 1997; 400: 309-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) was used to screen a genomic library. Both libraries were constructed in EMBL-3 SP6/T7 (CLONTECH, Heidelberg, Germany) and tested as previously described (9Garcı́a-Guzmán M. Sala F. Sala S. Campos-Caro A. Stühmer W. Gutiérrez L.M. Criado M. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1995; 7: 647-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). In both cases several overlapping bacteriophage clones were purified and characterized. Poly(A)+ RNA was directly selected from lysates of several bovine adrenal medullas by oligo(dT)-Dynabeads (Dynal, Oslo, Norway) and used in the RNase protection experiments. Probes were generated with SP6 and T7 polymerases (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Barcelona, Spain), [α-32P]CTP (Amersham Biosciences, Inc., Madrid, Spain) and the corresponding linearized templates (in the pSPT18 vector, Roche Molecular Biochemicals). A 462-bp RsaI-PstI fragment of the bovine β4 gene that included 286 bp 5′ to the beginning of the signal peptide sequence and 176 bp corresponding to the rest of the first exon and part of the second one was subcloned into the SmaI and PstI sites of pSPT18. After linearization of the plasmid with EcoRI, an antisense probe of 496 nucleotides was synthesized with SP6 RNA polymerase. To control protection efficiency a sense cRNA was synthesized by SP6 RNA polymerase transcription of a β4 cDNA construct linearized withXbaI. This cRNA should protect a fragment of 215 nucleotides when used in combination with the antisense probe. Parallel experiments were carried out with a smaller antisense probe which overlapped the 5′-end of the first one. For this purpose aRsaI-AvaII fragment of 310 bp was subcloned into the HincII site of pSPT18 previous filling-in with Klenow enzyme. An antisense probe of 352 nucleotides was obtained upon linearization with EcoRI and transcription with SP6 polymerase. As above, a cRNA sense fragment was used to control protection. In this case it was obtained by T7 polymerase transcription of the DNA used to obtain the large probe, previous linearization withXhoI and produced a protected fragment of 234 nucleotides (see Fig. 2 for further explanations). RNase protection experiments were performed using an RNase Protection Kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) as indicated by the manufacturer. Protected fragments were separated on a 7 m urea and 6% acrylamide gel along with several other labeled RNAs of known size which were also synthesized and used for calibration. Similar RNase protection experiments were carried out to find the 5′-end of human β4 mRNA. In this case a 323-bp BamHI-SacI fragment whose 3′-end was at 30 bp from the initial ATG, was cloned into the pSPT19 vector to generate a 362-nucleotide probe which was labeled according to the instructions of the MaxiScript SP6 kit (Ambion). The same fragment was also cloned into pSPT18 to synthesize a control RNA with SP6 RNA polymerase. This RNA generated a 325-nucleotide protected fragment in the presence of the labeled probe. In the case of the human promoter the RNase protection experiments were performed using a RPA III kit from Ambion and poly(A)+ RNA directly selected from lysates of SHSY-5Y cells by oligo(dT)-Dynabeads or purchased from CLONTECH (human brain and adrenal tissues). All β4 promoter-luciferase gene fusions were made in the pGL2-Basic vector (Promega, Madison, WI), introducing in its polylinker, upstream of the luciferase gene, the suitable β4 promoter fragments. These fragments were generated with restriction enzymes and directly cloned into pGL2-Basic or subcloned first in pBluescript and then transferred to pGL2-Basic. The vector pGL2-Control, which express the luciferase gene under the regulation of the SV40 promoter and enhancer sequences, was used to check luciferase activity. Deletion analysis of the most promoter-proximal region was performed by generating either appropriate restriction enzyme fragments or polymerase chain reaction fragments with suitable sense oligonucleotides and an antisense primer (5′-CTTTATGTTTTTGGCGTCTTCC-3′) that anneals to the pGL2-Basic vector, downstream of the site of transcription initiation. The basic strategy for site-directed mutagenesis of the different elements in region −99 to −64 of the bovine β4 promoter (see Fig.4) consisted of the following steps. (a) We performed polymerase chain reaction (25 cycles at 94 °C for 10 s, 50 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 45 s) amplification of p99β4LUC (or its single mutant when the double mutant was desired) with appropriate mutagenic primers in the sense orientation, which generated restriction sites useful to confirm mutagenesis. We used the same oligonucleotide mentioned above, as antisense primer. (b) Polymerase chain reaction products were cloned into pBluescript, sequenced, and transferred to the appropriate construct into the pGL2-Basic vector. The introduced mutations are indicated in lowercase letters in Fig. 4 A (sites 1 and 2). The strategy for mutagenesis of the elements in region −74 to −44 of the human β4 promoter was based on the presence of a SacII site at the 3′-end of the region containing the elements to be mutated and anXmaI site (from pGL2-Basic) at the 5′-end. Complementary oligonucleotides carrying the desired mutations and the mentioned restriction sites were annealed and cloned into the corresponding construct in place of the original sequences. Chromaffin cells were isolated from bovine adrenal glands as described (19Gandı́a L. Casado L.F. López M.G. Garcı́a A.G. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1991; 103: 1073-1078Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) and cultured in 90% Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma, Madrid), 10% fetal calf serum, 10 μm cytosine arabinoside, and 10 μm 5-fluoro-2′-deoxyuridine (Sigma) to prevent fibroblast proliferation. SHSY-5Y human neuroblastoma cells were grown in 90% Eagle's minimal essential medium with Glutamax-1 (Invitrogen, Barcelona, Spain) and 10% fetal calf serum. COS cells were grown in 90% Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and 10% fetal calf serum. C2C12 cells were grown in 85% Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and 15% fetal calf serum. Plasmids were purified by Concert columns (Invitrogen). All cell types were transfected by the calcium phosphate procedure (20Graham F.L. van der Eb A.J. Virology. 1973; 52: 456-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (6495) Google Scholar). Chromaffin cells on 48-well plates (5 × 105 cells/well) were incubated with 0.75 μg of pGL2 vector or an equivalent amount (in molar terms) of the different constructs derived from this vector and with 0.75 μg of β-galactosidase expression vector pCH110 (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) as a control of transfection efficiency. SHSY-5Y (105 cells/well), COS cells (5 × 104cells/well), or C2C12 cells (104 cells/well) on 24-well plates, were incubated with 1.5 μg of the different β4 constructs and 1.5 μg of pCH110 per well. Cells were harvested after 48 h and lysed with reporter lysis buffer (Promega). β-Galactosidase and luciferase activities were then determined in the lysates with the corresponding assay systems (Promega). Luciferase activity was normalized to values obtained with constructs representative of each β4 subunit. They are indicated in the corresponding figure legends. Crude nuclear extracts were prepared from cultured cells as described by Schreiber et al. (21Schreiber E. Matthias P. Müller M.M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 176419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3917) Google Scholar). The DNA fragment corresponding to region −99 to +66 of the bovine β4 promoter was obtained by digesting pBluescript subclones either with XbaI and EcoRI (wild probe) or SacI and EcoRI (mutant probes) and end-labeled by Klenow filling with [α-32P]dATP. The human β4 probes were obtained by annealing complementary oligonucleotides corresponding to region −74 to −38 and end-labeled by Klenow filling with [α-32P]dCTP. The DNA-protein binding reaction volumes were 20 μl containing 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, 5 μg of bovine serum albumin, 2 μg of poly(dA-dT)·poly(dA-dT) (Amersham Biosciences Inc.), 2 μg of nuclear extract protein, and 20,000 cpm of 32P-labeled probe. Reactions were incubated for 10 min at room temperature; the labeled probe was added; and the incubation was continued for an additional 20-min period. For competition studies, the nuclear extract was incubated with the competing oligonucleotide prior to the labeled probe during 20 min. Supershift assays were performed by preincubating nuclear extracts with 1 μl of antibodies against different transcription factors (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) or rabbit IgG (Sigma) for 3 h on ice before probe addition. The antibody against the B subunit of NF-Y was generously provided by Drs. Mathis, Benoist, and Mantovani (Université Louis Pasteur, Strasbourg, France). The equivalent anti-NF-Yb antibody (CBF-A, C-20) from Santa Cruz Biotechnology was used in later experiments with the human β4 promoter. A bovine genomic library was screened and several overlapping clones were isolated. Clone λbovβ4–11 contained ∼13 kb of bovine genomic sequence including exon 1 and ∼1.2 kb of 5′-flanking region. This region was further subcloned and sequenced (Fig. 1) revealing the lack of a TATA box. The 5′-end of β4 mRNA was mapped by RNase protection analyses (Fig. 2). A 496-residue antisense riboprobe (Fig. 2, Probe 1) yielded a protected fragment of ∼309 bases that mapped transcription initiation to a thymine located 125 bp upstream of the initial ATG (arrowhead at position +1, in Fig. 1). Other protected fragments of smaller size and similar intensity were also observed, suggesting that alternative initiation sites exist. They are also indicated in Fig. 1 (arrowheads and small squares). To improve precision in the determination of the transcription initiation sites, a second overlapping probe was used (Fig. 2, Probe 2). In this case several protected fragments of 156, 155, 134, and 133 bp were observed and mapped transcription initiation to the same sites that the larger probe. A series of constructs was generated to determine the regions of the bovine β4 subunit promoter that contributed to its maximal activity (Fig. 3). These constructs were introduced into chromaffin, C2C12, and COS cells. Constructs containing 81 bp (p81β4LUC) or more (up to 1256 bp) of β4 promoter sequence plus 66 bp of 5′-noncoding region showed similar activity. Two shorter constructs (p63β4LUC and p39β4LUC) showed a ∼60% decrease in promoter activity, whereas a further 5′ deletion (p4β4LUC) was even less active. The pattern of promoter activity was similar in the three cell types mentioned above, indicating that the tested constructs lacked elements able to confer cell-specific transcription. The only exception was construct p787β4LUC, which showed a ∼20–30% decrease in activity in C2C12 and COS cells but not in chromaffin cells. Therefore, in C2C12 and COS but not chromaffin cells, elements predominantly located between −353 and −787 with respect to the transcription initiation site may have a negative effect on β4 promoter activity. However, the largest construct tested (p1256β4LUC) also contains this region and exhibited increased activity (∼100–120%) in the three cell types. Elements in the minimal promoter, between 81 and 63 bp upstream of the start site of transcription, appear to be critical for basal transcription of the β4 subunit gene in transient transfection assays, since: (a) their deletion produced ∼60% decrease in transcriptional activity, and (b) additional upstream sequences did not significantly increase activity. In this region the presence of inverted GC and CCAAT boxes was detected (see Fig.4 A) and, therefore, they were chosen for mutagenic analysis. These analysis were performed, however, in the context of p99β4LUC instead of p81β4LUC, to leave a few additional nucleotides at the 5′-end of one of the elements (numbered2 in Fig. 4 A). Otherwise, this region would be located just at the 5′-end of construct p81β4LUC. When the GC box was altered (site 1, Fig. 4 A), β4 promoter activity in C2C12 and COS cells decreased to ∼60% of that observed for the parent construct (p99β4LUC), whereas in chromaffin cells the decrease was less pronounced (Fig. 4 B). The mutant of the CCAAT box (site 2, Fig. 4 B) affected promoter activity in chromaffin and C2C12 cells (about 25% decrease) but did not have any effect in COS cells (Fig. 4 B). Finally, the double mutant of sites 1 and 2 produced a stronger decrease (to ∼40% of the parent construct) than the sum of the single mutations (Fig. 4 B) in chromaffin and COS cells, whereas in C2C12 cells the effects were additive. Thus, in chromaffin cells a mere addition of the single mutant effects would produce a decrease of about 33% in activity, whereas the double mutant yielded a 65% decrease. In COS cells a decrease of 35% in activity would be expected upon the addition of the single mutant effects, however, the double mutant yielded a 58% decrease. These results suggest that sites 1 and 2 do integrate a whole synergistic mechanism required for basal promoter activity in chromaffin and COS cells. DNA fragments carrying the wild-type −99 to +66 promoter region and the corresponding site 1 and site 2 mutants from the previous functional studies (Fig. 4) were labeled and incubated with nuclear extracts from chromaffin cells (Fig.5). Two retarded bands were observed (Fig. 5 A, lane 2, labeled as circleand arrowhead) when using the wild-type fragment. Both bands were competed with increasing amounts of unlabeled fragment (Fig.5 A, lanes 4 and 5). Recombinant Sp1 produced a main retarded complex (Fig. 5 A, lane 3), coincident in position with one of those observed with nuclear extracts (arrowhead). By contrast, when the site 1 mutant was used as probe, neither the upper complex was formed with chromaffin nuclear extracts (Fig. 5 A, lane 7) nor recombinant Sp1 retarded the probe (Fig. 5 A, lane 8). This suggests that a protein from chromaffin extracts, which could be Sp1, is binding to the probe at site 1. When the site 2 mutant was used as probe the formation of the lower complex was abolished (Fig. 5 A, lane 10) and Sp1 was able to form a complex (Fig. 5 A, lane 11), suggesting that a protein from chromaffin extracts, which is not Sp1, is binding to the probe at site 2. Antibody supershift analysis was employed in an attempt to identify the proteins producing the retarded bands. The upper complex (arrowhead) observed with both the wild and the site 2 mutant probes was retarded by an anti-Sp1 antibody (Fig.5 B, lanes 15 and 22, respectively), whereas no supershift was observed with antibodies against Sp3 (Fig.5 B, lane 16). The lower complex (circle) was shifted by an anti-NF-Yb antibody (Fig. 5 B, lane 19). These results suggest that transcription factors Sp1 and NF-Y are binding to the probe. When using C2C12 and COS cell nuclear extracts a similar pattern of retarded bands was observed (Fig. 5 C, lanes 24 and27), although faster migrating complexes were also present with C2C12 extracts and the Sp1 upper band was less prominent. Again, the major band was supershifted with an anti-NF-Yb antibody (Fig. 5 C, lanes 26 and 29). Given that Sp1 and NF-Y bind to the GC and CCAAT boxes at sites 1 and 2, respectively (Fig. 5), and that the simultaneous alteration of these boxes produced a significant decrease of the transcriptional activity in luciferase reporter experiments (i.e. the activity of the double mutant p2-1β4LUC was 35, 52, and 42% of the one observed with the wild-type construct p99β4LUC in chromaffin, C2C12, and COS cells, respectively), we suggest that both, Sp1 and NF-Y, are involved in the transcriptional regulation of the bovine β4 promoter. Comparison of the β4 bovine promoter to its rat counterpart previously published (14Bigger C.B. Casanova E.A. Gardner P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32842-32848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 15Bigger C.B. Melnikova I.N. Gardner P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25976-25982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) did not show significant sequence homology. In an attempt to know whether this heterogeneity is extended to other species, we decided to isolate and characterize the human β4 promoter. A human genomic library was screened and several overlapping clones were isolated. Clone λ101 contained ∼20 kb of human genomic sequence including exon 1 and probably exon 2 as well as ∼5 kb of 5′-flanking region. This region was further subcloned and about 720 bp located 5′ from the initial ATG were sequenced. This sequence was identical to the one deposited in the NCBI data base with accession number NT_010218 Region 389312–390032. A comparison of ∼1200 bp of bovine and human β4 promoter sequences adjacent to the transcription initiation site was performed with the Blast 2 program (22Tatusova T.A. Madden T.L. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1999; 174: 247-250Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and the result is shown in Fig. 6. Several homology regions were detected, ranging from 60% to more than 85% identity. These highly similar regions accounted for more than half of the whole sequences. As indicated in the diagram of Fig. 6(lower panel), the structure of both promoters is similar, revealing regions of high or moderate homology flanked by stretches (ranging from 50 to 165 bp) of dissimilar sequences. By contrast, comparisons performed with the rat and either the bovine or human promoters did not yield significant homologies. The 5′-end of human β4 mRNA was also mapped by RNase protection analyses (Fig.7). An antisense riboprobe incubated with mRNA from SHSY-5Y cells yielded several protected fragments that mapped transcription initiation to sites located between 91 and 125 bp upstream of the initial ATG (indicated by arrowheads for major fragments and small squares for minor ones in Fig. 6). One of them was also predominant in experiments performed with human brain and adrenal mRNAs (Fig. 7) and for this reason we have numbered this position as +1 (also indicated as arrowhead at position +1 in Fig. 6). The multiple initiation sites for the human and bovine β4 subunit genes are approximately located in the same area (indicated as vertical boxes in lower panel of Fig. 6).Figure 7Determination of the human β4 subunit gene transcription initiation site(s).

These constructs were introduced into SHSY-5Y cells, a human neuroblastoma cell line that express the β4 subunit endogenously (23Lukas R. Norman S. Lucero L. Mol. Cell Neurosci. 1993; 4: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) as well as in mouse muscle C2C12 cells, that express the muscular-type nAChR (24Yu L. LaPolla R.J. Davidson N. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 3539-3555Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 25Gardner P.D. Heinemann S. Patrick J. Brain Res. 1987; 427: 69-76PubMed Google Scholar). In both cell lines, the construct containing 74 bp of β4 promoter sequence (considering the initiation site labeled as +1 in Fig. 6 as reference for numbering) plus 97 bp of 5′-noncoding region (p74hβ4LUC) showed the maximal activity. When the luciferase activity of this construct was normalized for transfection efficiency and compared in these two cell lines it was about 8 times higher in SHSY-5Y cells than in C2C12 cells. On the other hand, the activity of p74hβ4LUC was 29 and 35% of the activity shown by pGL2Control in C2C12 and SHSY-5Y cells, respectively. When larger constructs were used (p255 and 960hβ4LUC) the relative luciferase activity decreased up to 60–70% of the activity observed with p74hβ4LUC. The activity of p74hβ4LUC in SHSY-5Y and C2C12 cells was about 90% reduced when 46 bp of the β4 promoter 5′-end were deleted further (p28hβ4LUC) and was barely detectable upon the additional deletion of 37 bp (p+9hβ4LUC). These results suggest that elements located between 74 and 28 bp of the transcription initiation site are essential for transcription. A search for transcription factors which could interact with elements at the proximal promoter region of the β4 subunit revealed the existence of two GC-boxes (labeled 1and 2 in Fig. 9 A) and an inverted CCAAT box with one mismatch in the core motif (labeled 3 in Fig. 9 A). A systematic analysis of these putative regulatory elements was carried out, by looking at the functional effects produced by their mutagenesis in the context of p74hβ4LUC (Fig. 9 B). Mutation of GC-box 1 had virtually no effect on functional activity relative to p74hβ4LUC. However, mutation of GC-box 2 resulted in 75, 84, and 83% decrease in transcript"

Adenylosuccinate synthetase (IMP:l-aspartate ligase (GDP forming) EC 6.3.4.4) is essential to most organisms (1Stayton M.M. Rudolph F.B. Fromm H.J. Curr. Top.

The enzymic reaction proceeds in two steps (3Honzatko R.B. Fromm H.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 370: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 7Poland B.W. Bruns C. Fromm H.J. Honzatko R.B.

First, the γ-phosphoryl group of GTP is transferred to the O-6 atom of IMP. His41 is presumably a catalytic acid, transferring a proton to the β-phosphoryl group of GDP as it forms in the active site. Asp13 abstracts a proton from the N-1 atom of IMP, thereby facilitating the formation of the 6-oxyanion of the nucleotide. In the second step of the reaction, the α-amino group of l-aspartate attacks the C-6 atom of 6-phosphoryl-IMP. His41 again probably transfers a proton but this time to inorganic phosphate as it leaves the C-6 atom of the purine base. The β-carboxyl group of l-aspartate may abstract a proton from its own α-amino group (3Honzatko R.B. Fromm H.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 370: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Although the first reaction can occur in the absence of l-aspartate (6Bass M.B. Fromm H.J. Rudolph F.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 12330-12333Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), no products are released until after the second reaction (4Rudolph F.B. Fromm H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 3832-3839Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In crystallographic complexes, the catalytic metal (Mg2+) coordinates the α- and β-phosphoryl groups of GDP, the 6-phosphoryl group of 6-phosphoryl-IMP, and the N-formyl group of hadacidin (3Honzatko R.B. Fromm H.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 370: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). (Hadacidin (N-formylN-hydroxyglycine) is a competitive inhibitor with respect tol-aspartate; see Refs. 1Stayton M.M. Rudolph F.B. Fromm H.J. Curr. Top.

Crystallographic complexes with Mn2+ and Ca2+, the only other metal cations known to support synthetase activity (1Stayton M.M. Rudolph F.B. Fromm H.J. Curr. Top.

Honzatko, unpublished observations. According to the “induced fit” concept (10Koshland D.E., Jr. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1958; 44: 98-104Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), some fraction of the enzyme-substrate binding energy stabilizes the transition state. Structures of the ligand-free and ligated forms of the synthetase differ in that several disordered loops of the ligand-free enzyme, which contribute residues essential to catalysis, form ordered structures in the presence of substrates and substrate analogs (11−14). The largest conformational change (∼9 Å) occurs in loop 40−53, which folds against the guanine nucleotide, putatively stabilizing the transition state by its interactions with Mg2+ and the phosphoryl groups of the nucleotide (12Poland B.W. Fromm H.J. Honzatko R.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 264: 1013-1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The largest conformational changes and the vast majority of ligand-protein hydrogen bonds are at the guanine nucleotide pocket and, hence, implicate GTP in the structural rearrangements. Data equally compelling, however, suggest an IMP-driven conformational change. IMP is crucial for the dimerization of the synthetase monomers (15Wang W. Gorrel A. Honzatko R.B. Fromm H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7078-7084Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The 5′-phosphoryl group of IMP hydrogen bonds with Arg143 from the symmetry-related subunit of the synthetase dimer (12Poland B.W. Fromm H.J. Honzatko R.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 264: 1013-1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Mutation of Arg143 significantly elevates the K m for IMP and abolishes ligand-induced dimerization of the synthetase (3Honzatko R.B. Fromm H.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 370: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The 5′-phosphoryl group of IMP is essential for catalytic activity; IMP analogs, in which a carbon, nitrogen, or sulfur atom replaces one of the phosphate oxygen atoms, are poor substrates (16Hampton A. Chu S.Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1970; 198: 594-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The 5′-phosphoryl group of IMP interacts with the side chain of Asn38, and the mutation of Asn38 to alanine lowersk cat 200-fold but has no effect onK m for any of the substrates (17Wang W. Gorrell A. Hou Z. Honzatko R.B. Fromm H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16000-16004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Evidently, the total binding energy of the Asn38–IMP hydrogen bond goes toward the stabilization of the transition state. Presented here are crystal structures of adenylosuccinate synthetase from Escherichia coli that provide direct evidence of a central role for IMP in organizing the active site. One complex (hereafter the pyrophosphate complex) has IMP, hadacidin (an analog ofl-aspartate), and Mg2+-pyrophosphate (in place of Mg2+-GDP) at an ordered active site, hence demonstrating that the guanine base is not essential for organization of the active site. A second complex has IMP and hadacidin (hereafter the IMP-hadacidin complex) at an ordered active site that does not bind Mg2+, even at concentrations as high as 100 mm. The association of Mg2+ with the active site therefore requires the phosphoryl moiety of the guanine nucleotide. A third complex has IMP alone (hereafter the IMP complex) and, aside from thel-aspartate binding loop, has an ordered active site. Hence, IMP-enzyme interactions alone suffice in driving the major conformational transitions of the synthetase active site. The above structures provide a basis for understanding ligand binding synergism in adenylosuccinate synthetase, substantial effects on catalytic rates due to mutations well removed from the active site, and the requirement for an unmodified 5′-phosphoryl group of IMP. The synthetase was prepared as described previously (18Wang W. Hou Z. Honzatko R.B. Fromm H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16911-16916Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) from a genetically engineered strain of E. coli. Enzyme purity exceeded 95% as determined by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (data not shown). Hadacidin was a generous gift of Drs. Fred Rudolph and Bruce Cooper, Department of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, Rice University. All other reagents came from Sigma. Crystals were grown by the method of hanging drops under conditions similar to those reported previously (12Poland B.W. Fromm H.J. Honzatko R.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 264: 1013-1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In growing crystals of the pyrophosphate complex, droplets contained equal volumes (6 μl) of an enzyme solution (HEPES, 30 mm; pyrophosphate, 2 mm;IMP, 4 mm; hadacidin, 4 mm; and protein, 18 mg/ml at pH 6.8) and a crystallization buffer (polyethylene glycol 8000, 16% w/v; cacodylic acid/sodium cacodylate, pH 6.5, 100 mm; and magnesium acetate, 100 mm). Mg2+ of the crystallization buffer precipitated pyrophosphate at 2 mm. The precipitate was removed by filtration (0.2-μm pore) before crystallization. Hence, the actual concentration of pyrophosphate is significantly lower than 2 mm but saturating under the conditions employed. The final pH of the crystallization buffer was 6.5. Wells contained 500 μl of crystallization buffer. Conditions of crystal growth for the IMP-hadacidin complex and the IMP complex differ from those of the pyrophosphate complex only by the omission of pyrophosphate or both pyrophosphate and hadacidin. Crystals of ∼0.5 mm in all dimensions and belonging to the space group P3221 grew in about one week under all sets of conditions. The crystals are isomorphous to those of Poland et al. (12Poland B.W. Fromm H.J. Honzatko R.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 264: 1013-1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Data were collected on a Siemens area detector at 100 K and were reduced by using XENGEN (19Howard A.J. Nielsen C. Xuong N.H. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 114: 452-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). The data sets were at least 98% complete to their nominal resolution (where <I/ς(I)> = 2; Table I).

Biol. 1996; 264: 1013-1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), omitting all ligands, solvent molecules, and residues 37−52 (the dynamic loop that undergoes the most significant conformational change). Models of ligands and amino acid residues were fit to the resulting electron density map, followed by a cycle of refinement using XPLOR (20Brün̈ger A.T. XPLOR, version 3. Yale University Press, New Haven, CT1992Google Scholar). Constants of force and geometry for the protein came from the work of Engh and Huber (21Engh R.A. Huber R. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 392-400Crossref Scopus (2533) Google Scholar), and those for hadacidin from Poland et al. (12Poland B.W. Fromm H.J. Honzatko R.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 264: 1013-1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Constants of force and geometry for pyrophosphate were based on the phosphoryl groups of GTP and ATP. In early rounds of refinement, all the crystal structures were heated to 2000 K and then cooled in steps of 25 K. In later rounds of refinement, the systems were heated to 1000 to 1500 K but cooled in steps of 10 K. After the slow cooling protocol was complete (at 300 K), the models were subjected to 120 steps of conjugate gradient minimization, followed by 20 steps of individual B-parameter refinement. Individual B-parameters were subjected to the following restraints: nearest neighbor, main-chain atoms, 1.5 Å2; next-to-nearest neighbor, main-chain atoms, 2.0 Å2; nearest neighbor, side-chain atoms, 2.0 Å2; and next-to-nearest neighbor, side-chain atoms, 2.5 Å2. Water molecules were added if electron density at a level 2.5ς was present in maps based on Fourier coefficients (‖Fobs‖ − ‖Fcalc‖)exp(iα calc) and acceptable hydrogen bonds could be made to an existing atom of the model. Water molecules were omitted if after refinement they were more than 3.3 Å from their nearest neighbor or if their thermal parameters exceeded 80 Å2. Harmonic restraints (50 kcal/mol) were placed on the positions of the oxygen atoms of new water molecules to allow them to relax initially by adjustments in orientation. Occupancies of water molecules were not refined because of the high correlation between occupancy and thermal parameters. Therefore, solvent sites with B values between 50 and 80 Å2 probably represent water molecules with occupancy parameters below 1.0 and thermal parameters substantially lower than those reported from refinement. The models reported here have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank, Research Collaboratory for Structural Bioinformatics (RSCB), with accession labels 1KJX, 1KKB, and1KKF. The asymmetric unit consists of a monomer subunit; the molecular 2-fold axis of the synthetase dimer coincides with a crystallographic 2-fold axis (12Poland B.W. Fromm H.J. Honzatko R.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 264: 1013-1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The method of Luzzati (22Luzzati V. Acta Crystallogr. 1956; 5: 802-810Crossref Google Scholar) indicates an uncertainty in coordinates of 0.3 Å for the structures. The amino acid sequence used in refinement is identical to that reported previously (14Silva M.M. Poland B.W. Hoffman C.R. Fromm H.J. Honzatko R.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 254: 431-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Results of data collection and refinement are in TableI. The program PROCHECK (23Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar) indicates better stereochemistry than is typical for a structure of 2.5 Å resolution. All residues fall within the generously allowed region of the Ramachandran plot except Gln10 as noted in previous studies (11Poland B.W. Silva M.M. Serra M.A. Cho Y. Kim K.H. Harris E.M.S.

Biol. 1996; 264: 1013-1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) give root mean-square deviations in Cα coordinates of ∼0.25, 0.35, and 0.35 Å for the pyrophosphate, IMP-hadacidin, and IMP complexes, respectively. Thermal parameters vary from 5−65, 15−75, and 5−69 Å2 for the pyrophosphate, IMP-hadacidin, and IMP complexes, respectively. An overview of the IMP complex is presented in Fig. 1, along with electron density from an omit map of the IMP-ligated complex. A difference map of the pyrophosphate complex using calculated phases based on the coordinates of the nitrate complex (Mg2+, GDP, and nitrate molecules omitted) clearly displays three isolated, ball-like densities at the active site. One spheroid of electron density is at the observed Mg2+ site, whereas the other two are at the putative β- and γ-phosphoryl sites of GTP. Thermal parameters for atoms of pyrophosphate (average thermal parameter of 29 Å2) and Mg2+ (thermal parameter of 42 Å2) refined in this density are comparable with each other and with nearby atoms of the protein (residues 40–41, average thermal parameter of 29 Å2). Hence, even though Mg2+ and pyrophosphate are depleted by precipitation (under “Experimental Procedures”), the above suggests ligands bound at or near full occupancy. The distance between centers of the spheroids is 3 Å, consistent with that of pyrophosphate and too close for the simultaneous binding of two molecules of orthophosphate. Furthermore, orthophosphate is a poor inhibitor of the synthetase (K i ∼ 5 mm), and its concentration here (as an impurity) should not exceed 50 μm. The interactions of hadacidin and IMP with the synthetase in the pyrophosphate complex are essentially identical to those of hadacidin and IMP in the nitrate complex (12Poland B.W. Fromm H.J. Honzatko R.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 264: 1013-1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Hence, only interactions of the pyrophosphate molecule and Mg2+ are presented here. The two phosphoryl groups of pyrophosphate (hereafter called the β- and γ-phosphoryl groups of pyrophosphate) bind to the putative β- and γ-phosphoryl sites of GTP (Fig. 2). The β-phosphoryl group hydrogen bonds with backbone amides 15, 16, and 17 and coordinates to Mg2+ (Fig. 2). The γ-phosphoryl group coordinates to Mg2+ and also hydrogen bonds with Lys16, His41, and backbone amides 13, 40, and 224. Mg2+ coordinates with two oxygen atoms of pyrophosphate (one each from the β- and γ-phosphoryl groups), backbone carbonyl 40, and the N-formyl group of hadacidin. The side-chain of Asp13 (2.9 Å away from Mg2+) is not part of the inner coordination sphere of the Mg2+. Hence, Mg2+ in the pyrophosphate complex is four-coordinated. Mg2+ in the nitrate complex (12Poland B.W. Fromm H.J. Honzatko R.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 264: 1013-1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) is five-coordinated; the α-phosphoryl group of GDP in the nitrate complex, which has no analogous element in the pyrophosphate complex, provides the additional coordinate bond. Loop 40−53 of the pyrophosphate complex adopts the closed conformation observed in previous studies (7Poland B.W. Bruns C. Fromm H.J. Honzatko R.B. J. Biol.

Residues 38−41 move about 1 Å toward the 5′-phosphoryl group of IMP, a movement amplified into the 9 Å displacement of the Cα atom of residue 46. The conformational change of loop 40−53 ruptures the salt link between His41 and Asp21 observed in the ligand-free structure. In the pyrophosphate complex, ND1 of His41hydrogen bonds with the side-chain of Glu221, whereas NE2 of His41 interacts with the γ-phosphoryl group of pyrophosphate. The peptide linkage between residues 39 and 40 reorients, allowing the backbone carbonyl of Gly40 to coordinate the Mg2+. The large conformational change in loop 40−53 of the pyrophosphate complex, described above, is accompanied by additional conformational changes also observed in the nitrate complex (12Poland B.W. Fromm H.J. Honzatko R.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 264: 1013-1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The peptide linkage between residues 223 and 224 reorients, allowing backbone amide 224 to hydrogen bond with the pyrophosphate molecule. The C-terminal end of helix H2 shifts by as much as 3 Å toward loop 40−53. Asp333, Lys331, and Ser414(residues that interact with the base of guanine nucleotide) and loop 416−421 move as much as 2.5 Å toward loop 40−53. The conformational change in loop 416−421 allows Asp418 to hydrogen bond with backbone amides 46 and 47, backbone carbonyl 419 to hydrogen bond with backbone amide 44, Asp21 to hydrogen bond with Arg419, and backbone carbonyl 417 to hydrogen bond with backbone carbonyl 42 through a bridging water molecule (Fig.3). A water molecule occupies the same site in fully ligated complexes (7Poland B.W. Bruns C. Fromm H.J. Honzatko R.B. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 12753-15759Crossref Scopus (40) Google Scholar), hydrogen bonding to the 2′-OH of GDP, in addition to the above-named backbone carbonyl groups. Loop 298−304 becomes ordered as Thr300 hydrogen bonds with backbone carbonyls 38 and 39 and to the side chain of His53. Hence, even in the absence of ribosyl and base moieties of the guanine nucleotide, the conformation of the guanine nucleotide pocket in the pyrophosphate complex is identical to that observed in fully ligated complexes. IMP and hadacidin interact with the synthetase as observed in the pyrophosphate complex above. No electron density, however, is evident for Mg2+, even though the concentration of Mg2+ in the crystallization solution is approximately 100 mm. Nonetheless, the loss of the coordinate bond between Mg2+and the N-formyl group of hadacidin does not perturb other interactions between hadacidin and the synthetase. The conformational differences between the pyrophosphate complex and the IMP-hadacidin complex are in the immediate vicinity of the binding site for pyrophosphate-Mg2+ (Fig.4). In the IMP-hadacidin complex, His41 interacts only with Glu221. Both side- and main-chain atoms in the vicinity of residues 39−41 possess relatively high thermal parameters in the IMP-hadacidin complex. Backbone carbonyl 40, which coordinates to Mg2+ in the pyrophosphate complex, interacts with OG1 of Thr42 in the IMP-hadacidin complex after a ∼90o rotation of the peptide plane between residues 40−41. Lys16, which hydrogen bonds with pyrophosphate, interacts exclusively with the side chain of Glu14 in the IMP-hadacidin complex. The absence of the entire guanine nucleotide then causes only localized conformational change in the vicinity of the Mg2+, β-phosphoryl, and γ-phosphoryl binding sites. The conformation of the active site of the IMP complex is similar to that of the pyrophosphate and IMP-hadacidin complex in regard to the movement of loop 40−53. In addition, high thermal parameters and hydrogen bonding within the Mg2+ recognition element (residues 39−42), observed in the IMP-hadacidin complex, are retained in the IMP complex. Significant differences in conformation, however, are evident. The base of IMP, stacked against hadacidin in the other complexes, moves 0.8 Å into the hadacidin/l-aspartate pocket. O-6 of IMP hydrogen bonds with NZ of Lys16 and backbone amide 224 by way of a bridging water molecule, which lies in the γ-phosphoryl pocket of GTP (Fig. 5). Asp13 still interacts with IMP, but to maintain the OD1 to N-1 hydrogen bond, its side chain must rotate by ∼90° about its Cβ−Cγ bond. In contrast, the base of IMP and the carboxyl group of Asp13are coplanar in complexes that either have hadacidin or both hadacidin and Mg2+ at the active site (7Poland B.W. Bruns C. Fromm H.J.

Biol. 1996; 264: 1013-1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The hadacidin/l-aspartate binding element (residues 298−304) is disordered in the IMP complex. Density is present for Arg305 and Arg303, but thermal parameters for these residues are high. The side chain of Arg305, which hydrogen bonds to hadacidin and to the α-phosphoryl group of GDP in fully ligated complexes (7Poland B.W. Bruns C. Fromm H.J. Honzatko R.B. J. Biol.

Arg303, which interacts with the carboxyl group of hadacidin, O2′ of IMP, OG1 of Thr301, and backbone carbonyl 127 in the IMP-hadacidin and pyrophosphate complexes, hydrogen bonds weakly with O2′ of IMP and backbone carbonyl 128. The structures presented here, along with previously reported complexes of the synthetase, permit a detailed analysis of the conformational changes induced by a particular ligand and the significance of these conformational changes to ligand binding synergism and stabilization of the transition state. The following discussion focuses on conformational transitions, presented schematically in Fig. 6. IMP alone induces long-range conformational changes in the active site of adenylosuccinate synthetase (Fig. 6, A and B). Loops 40−53, 120−130, and 416−421 attain conformations in the presence of IMP that are similar to those observed in complete ligand complexes of the synthetase. IMP-induced conformational changes in loops 40−53 and 416−421 create the binding pocket for Mg2+-GTP and hence provide a structural basis for the binding synergism between ligands at the IMP and GTP sites. Asn38, located at the beginning of loop 40−53, hydrogen bonds with the 5′-phosphoryl group of IMP. The energy of that hydrogen bond must stabilize the transition state because the mutation of Asn38 to alanine reduces k cat up to 200-fold without an effect on the K m of substrates (17Wang W. Gorrell A. Hou Z. Honzatko R.B. Fromm H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16000-16004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Arg419 and Asp21 form a salt-link some 30 Å away from the 5′-phosphoryl group of IMP, which evidently stabilizes the IMP-induced conformation of the synthetase. Mutations at positions 21 and 419 lower catalytic rates by 10- to 20-fold (17Wang W. Gorrell A. Hou Z. Honzatko R.B. Fromm H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16000-16004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The 5′-phosphoryl group of IMP enhances formation of synthetase dimers from monomers by directly interacting with Arg143 from the subunit related by molecular symmetry (14Silva M.M. Poland B.W. Hoffman C.R. Fromm H.J. Honzatko R.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 254: 431-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 15Wang W. Gorrel A. Honzatko R.B. Fromm H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7078-7084Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Loss of substrate efficacy due to single atom replacements of terminal oxygen atoms of the 5′-phosphoryl group of IMP further emphasizes a strict requirement for an unmodified phosphoryl group (16Hampton A. Chu S.Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1970; 198: 594-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The 5′-phosphoryl group of IMP therefore is both a handle by which the synthetase can grasp one of its substrates and a functional group essential to the stability of the transition state. Mg2+-GTP could perhaps elicit conformational movements in loop 40−53 and loop 416−421 comparable with those induced by IMP. Indeed, in crystal structures of adenylosuccinate synthetase fromArabidopsis thaliana and Triticum aestivum, GDP alone is present in ordered active sites (24Prade L. Cowan-Jacob S.W. Chemla P. Potter S. Ward E. Fonné-Pfister R. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 296: 569-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Unfortunately, the ligand-free conformations of the plant synthetases are unavailable. Hence, conformational changes induced by GDP in these systems can only be assumed. Efforts to grow crystals of the E. coli synthetase in the presence of Mg2+-GDP alone have been unsuccessful. Soaking guanine nucleotides into preformed crystals of the ligand-free enzyme, however, revealed the anticipated interactions between the base of GDP and the active site but with only weak interactions involving the phosphoryl moiety and no evidence for bound Mg2+ (25Poland B.W. Hou Z. Bruns C. Fromm H.J. Honzatko R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15407-15413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In soaks of the ligand-free crystals, guanine nucleotides did not move loop 40−53. In contrast, soaks of IMP alone destroyed crystals of the ligand-free synthetase. As lattice contacts in the crystal can selectively restrict conformational responses, the results from the soaking experiments only suggest greater sensitivity toward IMP in triggering a conformational change in loop 40−53. Fluorescence studies, however, also suggest differences between the GTP-ligated and fully ligated active sites of the E. colisynthetase. Tb3+-GTP binds to the synthetase with affinity comparable with the K m of GTP (26Soans C. Fromm H.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1991; 310: 475-480Google Scholar). The addition of IMP to a Tb3+-GTP-enzyme complex results in further change in terbium fluorescence emission. As the terbium cation is a potent inhibitor of the synthetase, phosphoryl transfer from GTP to IMP is unlikely. Instead, the IMP-induced change in terbium fluorescence could arise from a conformational change in loop 40−53. The absence of bound Mg2+ in the hadacidin-IMP complex, even though Mg2+ is present at a concentration of 100 mm, clearly demonstrates the absolute requirement for the guanine nucleotide in the association of Mg2+ with the active site. Yet in the absence of bound cation, hadacidin still interacts with the protein as it does in fully ligated complexes of the synthetase. The binding of hadacidin to the enzyme-IMP complex evidently brings about several small, but important, conformational changes (Fig. 6, B and C). In the presence of hadacidin, IMP now adopts the set of interactions observed in fully ligated complexes. The base of IMP and the carboxyl group of Asp13 are coplanar. Hadacidin places Arg305 in a conformation that favors an interaction with the α-phosphoryl group of guanine nucleotides. Loop 298−304 is ordered, with Arg303 participating in the set of interactions of fully ligated complexes. The side chain of Thr300 of that loop, in turn, hydrogen bonds with backbone carbonyls 38 and 53, further stabilizing the conformation of loop 40−53 and the Mg2+binding element. Hence, hadacidin (and presumablyl-aspartate) induces conformational change in the active site, which promotes productive binding of IMP and GTP. The Mg2+-polyphosphoryl moiety of the guanine nucleotide evidently finetunes the IMP-induced changes by driving a conformational change in the backbone of residues 40−41 and the side chains of Asp13, Lys16, and His41 (Fig. 6,C and D). (Asp13 and His41 are essential catalytic side chains; see Ref. 27Kang C. Sun N. Poland B.W. Gorrell A. Honzatko R.B. Fromm H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11881-11885Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar.) In fact, most of the binding energy of the Mg2+-polyphosphate moiety of the guanine nucleotide probably stabilizes the transition state, rather than promoting substrate affinity. GTP, GDP, and GMP have comparable binding affinities for the synthetase (1Stayton M.M. Rudolph F.B. Fromm H.J. Curr. Top. Cell Regul. 1983; 22: 103-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). In addition, mutations of Gly12 to valine, Glu14 to alanine, Gly15 to valine, and Gly17 to valine individually reduce k cat but do not affect theK m of GTP (27Kang C. Sun N. Poland B.W. Gorrell A.

Chem. 1992; 267: 2388-2392Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These residues belong to the P-loop (residues 8−16) of the synthetase and, in combination with residues 40−42, define the polyphosphoryl binding site. Asp13 and Lys16 have decidedly different conformations and/or interactions in the IMP complex relative to complexes with more complete ligation of the active site. Although IMP binds and induces significant conformational change in loop 40−53, the ligand itself and much of the catalytic machinery (Asp13, His41, backbone carbonyl 40, and Lys16) are not in their proper places until Mg2+-pyrophosphate (or Mg2+-GDP) binds to the active site. Adenylosuccinate synthetase is just one of a growing list of enzymes that employ flexible loops in biochemical function (29−33). The precise functional role of flexible loops can vary significantly. AMP, as an allosteric inhibitor, putatively modulates the conformational state of a dynamic loop in fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (29Choe J.-Y. Poland B.W. Fromm H.J. Honzatko R.B. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 11441-11450Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). A dynamic loop in S-adenosylmethionine synthetase may act as a gate, blocking access to the active site and modulating substrate affinity (30Fu Z., Hu, Y. Markham G.D. Takusagawa F. J. Biomol. Struct. Dyn. 1996; 13: 727-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The role of a dynamic loop in lactate dehydrogenase (31Abad-Zapatero C. Griffith J.P. Sussman J.L. Rossmann M.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 198: 445-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar), however, is analogous to that of adenylosuccinate synthetase. Pyruvate induces a conformational change in a loop of lactate dehydrogenase, allowing the side chain of Lys109 to interact with the carbonyl oxygen of the substrate. Directed mutation of Lys109 reduces activity 1500-fold with little effect on substrate affinity (34Clarke A.R. Atkinson T. Holbrook J.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1989; 14: 101-105Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). In the case of adenylosuccinate synthetase, the large conformational change in loop 40−53 is an amplification of a small conformational change involving the interaction of Asn38 with the 5′-phosphoryl group of IMP. Asn38, then, is a sensor. When IMP binds, the enzyme probably dimerizes, and the active site goes into a state of readiness. Mg2+-GTP and l-aspartate, acting alone, may not have the same effect on the global conformation of the synthetase or on its state of oligomerization. Because conformational transitions in the synthetase span a distance of 30 Å, the signal transmission from the sensor (Asn38) is on a scale comparable with that of allosteric enzymes. In a sense, the 5′-phosphoryl pocket is a regulatory/activation site embedded within the active site of the synthetase."
https://openalex.org/W1997289571,"The subunit interface of the homodimeric hemoglobin from Scapharca inaequivalvis, HbI, is stabilized by a network of interactions that involve several hydrogen-bonded structural water molecules, a hydrophobic patch, and a single, symmetrical salt bridge between residues Lys-30 and Asp-89. Upon mutation of Lys-30 to Asp, the interface is destabilized markedly. Sedimentation equilibrium and velocity experiments allowed the estimate of the dimerization constants for the unliganded (K 1,2 D = 8 × 104m−1) and for the CO-bound (K 1,2 L = 1 × 103m−1) and oxygenated (K 1,2 L = 70 m−1) derivatives. For the oxygenated derivative, the destabilization of the subunit interface with respect to native HbI corresponds to about 8 kcal/mol, an unexpectedly high figure. In the K30D mutant, at variance with the native protein, oxygen affinity and cooperativity are strongly dependent on protein concentration. At low protein concentrations (e.g. 1.2 × 10−5m heme), at which the monomeric species becomes significant also in the unliganded derivative, oxygen affinity increases and cooperativity decreases. At protein concentrations where both derivatives are dimeric (e.g. 3.3 × 10−3m heme), both cooperativity and oxygen affinity decrease. Taken together, the experimental data indicate that in the K30D mutant, the mechanism of cooperativity is drastically altered and is driven by a ligand-linked monomer-dimer equilibrium rather than being based on a direct heme-heme communication as in native HbI. The subunit interface of the homodimeric hemoglobin from Scapharca inaequivalvis, HbI, is stabilized by a network of interactions that involve several hydrogen-bonded structural water molecules, a hydrophobic patch, and a single, symmetrical salt bridge between residues Lys-30 and Asp-89.

The homodimeric hemoglobin from Scapharca inaequivalvis(HbI) is characterized by an unusual assembly of the globin chains that entails the juxtaposition of the heme carrying E-F helices. Dimer stability is achieved through a hydrophobic patch, a network of hydrogen bonds that is primarily mediated by structural water molecules at the subunit interface and two symmetrically related salt bridges between residues Lys-30 and Asp-89, located at the extreme edges of the interface itself. Cooperative ligand binding occurs with minor quaternary structural rearrangements and has been ascribed to the direct communication between the two heme groups that are in close contact across the subunit interface (1Royer W.E., Jr. Hendrickson W.A. Chiancone E. Science. 1990; 249: 518-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The heme propionate groups provide a direct pathway for heme-heme interaction (2Royer W.E., Jr. J. Mol.

Chem. 1993; 268: 5711-5718Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Ligand-linked structural changes are localized to the heme proximal side in which the phenyl ring of Phe-97 is packed closely against the proximal histidine in the unliganded species and is extruded from the heme pocket to the subunit interface in the liganded derivative. The movement of Phe-97 causes relaxation of the heme-heme intersubunit contacts and the disruption of the network of ordered water molecules at the interface. In contrast, the stereochemistry of the interface salt bridge between Lys-30 and Asp-89 does not undergo significant ligand-linked changes (2Royer W.E., Jr. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 235: 657-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Cooperative oxygen binding in HbI therefore is based on a completely different mechanism with respect to vertebrate hemoglobins where the presence of two distinct quaternary structures, a low affinity (T state) and a high affinity one (R state), is a prerequisite for heme-heme cooperation. In human hemoglobin, the transition between the two states is governed by a ligand-linked structural rearrangement of the heme pocket in one subunit that is communicated to the other subunits through the so-called α1β2 subunit interface. The quaternary rearrangements bring about the cleavage of specific intersubunit salt bridges and thereby provide a significant enthalpic contribution to the R-T conformational transition. A third completely different mechanism is observed in hemoglobins from lower vertebrates such as Cyclostomata, in which cooperative oxygen binding is the result of ligand-linked subunit dissociation. The behavior of lamprey hemoglobins is prototypical: the deoxygenated proteins are able to form dimers (and eventually higher order polymers), whereas the ligand-bound species are monomeric. In these proteins, the subunit dissociation process that accompanies ligand binding is also linked to the release of Bohr protons. The coupling between the two processes provides the entropic driving force for the observed cooperativity (5Andersen M.E. Gibson Q.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 4790-4799Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Qiu Y. Maillet D.H. Knapp J. Olson J.S. Riggs A.F. J. Biol.

In the present study, the cleavage of the salt bridge Lys-30–Asp-89 at the subunit interface of S. inaequivalvis HbI is shown to bring about a marked decrease in the stability of the dimeric assemblage, which in turn results in a radical change of the mechanism of cooperativity. The direct heme-heme interaction within the homodimer, which is at the basis of cooperative oxygen binding in the native protein, is replaced in the mutant by a ligand-linked dissociation into subunits. Escherichia coli strain W3110lacIq L8 was the host used for the overexpression of recombinant HbI (7Summerford C.M. Pardanani A. Betts A.H. Poteete A.R. Colotti G.

The Lys-30→Asp mutant (K30D) was constructed using PCR techniques to introduce a GAT codon at the desired position in the synthetic gene for wild-type HbI cloned into a pUHE21–2 plasmid containing the T7 promoter (7Summerford C.M.

The PCR amplification used the following primers: 5′-GAAAGTTATCGGATCCGACAAAGATGGTAAC-3′ (Lys-30→Asp) and 5′-CAGCGGAGATCTTACGCGTGATATGGTTAAC-3′. The resulting 255-bp product was digested with restriction enzymesBamHI and PstI and isolated using the QIAquick purification kit (Qiagen). This fragment was subcloned subsequently into the HbI expression vector pUHE21–2 digested withBamHI and PstI. The changes in the DNA sequence were confirmed by dideoxy sequencing. Recombinant K30D was overexpressed inE. coli as described for the wild-type protein (7Summerford C.M. Pardanani A. Betts A.H. Poteete A.R. Colotti G.

After pelleting the cell debris at 15,000 × g for 60 min, the supernatant was dialyzed against 5 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8, at 4 °C. After centrifugation (15,000 × g), the sample was loaded onto a DEAE-cellulose column pre-equilibrated with 5 mmTris-HCl, pH 8. Recombinant K30D eluted with 30 mmTris-HCl, pH 8. Thereafter the sample was dialyzed against 30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, and concentrated in an Amicon (Beverly, MA) 10-kDa molecular mass cut-off Centriprep concentrator to a final volume of 5–10 ml. The concentrated sample was loaded onto a 100-ml Toyopearl DEAE-650S (TosoHaas, Montgomeryville, PA) column pre-equilibrated with 30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5. The protein was purified further on a Sephadex G-50 gel-filtration column (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5. The purity of the protein was verified by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. UV-visible spectra were measured on a Jasco V-560 spectrophotometer, and circular dichroism spectra were measured on a Jasco J-710 spectropolarimeter. High dilution absorption and CD spectra were recorded in 10-cm optical path quartz cells (Hellma). Protein concentrations were determined using the extinction coefficient of the native protein, 14,300 m−1 cm−1at 557 nm for the deoxygenated derivative (8Chiancone E. Vecchini P. Verzili D. Ascoli F. Antonini E. J. Mol. Biol. 1981; 152: 577-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). All experiments were carried out at 10 °C and 30,000, 35,000, and 40000 rpm (sedimentation equilibrium) or 60,000 rpm (sedimentation velocity) on a Beckman XL-A analytical ultracentrifuge equipped with absorbance optics and an An60-Ti rotor. The protein concentration varied in the range 7–290 μm (heme) in 100 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.0. In sedimentation equilibrium experiments, data were collected every 3 h at an appropriate wavelength (434 or 557 nm and 421 or 540 nm for deoxy- and carbonmonoxy-hemoglobin, respectively) at a spacing of 0.001 cm with 10 averages in a step scan mode. Equilibrium was checked by comparing scans up to 24 h. Data sets were edited with REEDIT (J. Lary, National Analytical Ultracentrifugation Center, Storrs, CT) and fitted with NONLIN (PC version provided by Emory Braswell, National Analytical Ultracentrifugation Center, Storrs, CT) according to Johnsonet al. (9Johnson M. Correia J.J. Yphantis D.A. Halvorson H. Biophys. J. 1981; 36: 575-588Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar). Data from different concentrations and speeds were combined for global fitting. For fits to a monomer-dimer association scheme, the monomer molecular weight was fixed at the value determined from the amino acid sequence (16.5 kDa). As a control, absorbance spectra of all samples were measured in the ultracentrifuge cell before and after the run. In sedimentation velocity experiments, data were collected every 4 min at 410, 500, or 540 nm, depending on protein concentration, at a spacing of 0.005 cm with three averages in a continuous scan mode. Data were analyzed with DCDT (PC version provided by Walter Stafford, Boston Biomedical Research Institute, Boston, MA), which provides weight average sedimentation coefficients (10Stafford W.F. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 203: 295-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). The sedimentation coefficients were corrected to s20,w using standard procedures. The data were fitted to a monomer-dimer equilibrium as described previously (11Giangiacomo L. D'Avino R., Di Prisco G. Chiancone E. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 3062-3068Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Oxygen equilibria were measured in a tonometer according to the method of Rossi-Fanelli and Antonini (12Rossi-Fanelli A. Antonini E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1958; 77: 478-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). The measurements were carried out over the protein concentration range 12–3300 μm (heme). Oxygen equilibrium measurements at protein concentrations higher than 500 μm were carried out in a tonometer with a 0.25-mm path length cell. Full oxygen saturation was achieved under 1 atm of O2 gas. To account for the presence of oxygen-linked monomerization equilibria, oxygen binding curves as a function of protein concentration were fitted according to SchemeFS1. This scheme reduces to the following equations (Eqs. 1 and 2) in terms of a modified Adair model, Y=[K3(M)(x)+K1K1,2D(M)2(x)+2K1K2K1,2D(M)2(x)2]/C;Equation 1 C=(M)+K3(M)(x)+2K1,2D(M)2+2K1K1,2D(M)2(x)+2K1K2K1,2D(M)2(x)2Equation 2 where Y is the saturation fraction, (M) is the concentration of the deoxygenated monomer, (x) is the equilibrium concentration of the ligand, and C is the total protein concentration. The thermodynamic constantsK 1, K 2, andK 3 are the oxygen binding constants of the unliganded dimer, the monoligated dimer, and the unliganded monomer, respectively. K 1,2 L andK 1,2 D are the monomer-dimer association constants of the fully oxygenated and unliganded protein, respectively. The data sets (five records) were arranged into a data matrix, and five fitting curves were generated at each iteration. Least squares were calculated on the whole data set (global fitting procedure) by minimizing the values of four fitting parameters to Eqs. 1 and 2, namely the oxygen binding constant of the unligated species (K 1), the oxygen binding constant of the monoligated species (K 2), and the monomer-dimer equilibrium constants of the unligated and diligated derivatives (K 1,2 L and K 1,2 D). The values of K 1,2 L andK 1,2 D obtained from ultracentrifugation data were used as initial guesses. The kinetics of oxygen release were measured in oxygen pulse experiments by mixing the protein solution (10–200 μm) in the presence of an excess of sodium dithionite (0.02–0.1 m) with buffer solutions containing oxygen at concentrations varying from 1400 to 2 μm. The experiment was carried out in 0.25 mphosphate buffer at pH 7.0 and 20 °C in an Applied Photophysicsstopped flow apparatus (Leatherhead, UK). The observation wavelength was 434 or 557 nm. The measured first order rate constants were plotted as a function of oxygen saturation obtained by normalizing the observed amplitude to the measured oxy minus deoxy spectrum at 434 or 557 nm. The visible and circular dichroism spectra of the K30D mutant measured on the oxygenated and deoxygenated derivatives are superimposable to those reported for native HbI (Fig. 1) over a wide range of protein concentration (0.1–200 μm). Sedimentation equilibrium experiments conducted on deoxygenated and carbonylated K30D HbI yieldedK 1,2 values of (8.0 ± 0.1) × 104m−1 and (1.2 ± 0.2) × 103m−1, respectively (Fig.2). A direct measurement of theK 1,2 value for the oxygenated protein was not possible due to autoxidation of the heme iron over the time needed for sedimentation equilibrium measurements (>24 h). Therefore, the association-dissociation properties of the oxygenated derivative were investigated in sedimentation velocity experiments. Fitting the concentration dependence (over the range 7–140 μm) of the weight average sedimentation coefficients to a monomer-dimer model yielded a K 1,2 value of about 70m−1. Thus, over the protein concentration range covered in the functional studies reported below (12 μm-3.3 mm), the amount of dimers varies between 27 and 94% in deoxy K30D and between 0.1 and 15% in oxy K30D. The oxygen equilibrium measurements reported in the Hill plots of Fig. 3indicate that oxygen affinity and cooperativity depend on protein concentration over the range 1.2 × 10−5–3.3 × 10−3m heme. In contrast, the oxygen binding properties of the native protein are independent of protein concentration over the same range (log p 50 = 0.88 and n 50 = 1.45) (Fig. 3, dashed curve). In the mutant, at 8 × 10−4m heme, oxygen affinity is similar, and cooperativity is slightly decreased (log p 50 = 0.84 andn 50 = 1.35) with respect to native HbI. At 3.3 mm heme, the change in oxygen binding behavior is more evident because both a decrease in oxygen affinity and a further decrease in cooperativity are observed. At the lowest protein concentration studied (12 μm), oxygen binding is noncooperative (n 50 = 0.94), whereas oxygen affinity is 4–5-fold higher than in the native protein (logp 50 = 0.18). The curves of Fig. 3 a were calculated according to Eqs. 1and 2 (see “Experimental Procedures”). The fitting procedure used yields both the oxygen binding constants (K 1 andK 2) and the dimerization constants (K 1,2 L and K 1,2 D). The experimental values obtained from ultracentrifugation experiments of K 1,2 L andK 1,2 D and the values of theK 1 and K 2 of the native protein (0.044 and 0.39 torr−1, respectively) were used as initial guesses. Convergence of the fitting parameters is obtained after a few iterations and is accompanied by a 10-fold decrease of theK 2 value, which therefore reaches essentially the same value as K 1. Fig. 3 b shows that the dependence of log p 50 andn 50 on protein concentration calculated using the fitted values of the thermodynamic parameters is in good agreement with the experimental value of each single binding isotherm of Fig.3 a. The kinetics of oxygen release were measured in parallel on the native protein and on the K30D mutant in oxygen pulse experiments (Fig. 4). In this experiment, the observed rate for oxygen release is measured as a function of oxygen concentration. In native HbI, the observed first order rate increases from 100 s−1 at high oxygen saturation, at which the measurement monitors oxygen release from an R-like state, to 600 s−1 at low oxygen saturation, at which the measurement reflects primarily release from the monoligated T-like species (13Antonini E. Ascoli F. Brunori M. Chiancone E. Verzili D. Morris R.J. Gibson Q.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 6730-6738Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, the increase in the rate of oxygen release at low oxygen saturation can be considered as the kinetic manifestation of heme-heme interaction. In contrast, in the K30D mutant, the rate of dissociation is unchanged as a function of oxygen even at the highest protein concentration attained (200 μm) at which the deoxygenated protein is predominantly dimeric (>80%). The present study provides a unique example of a mutation that introduces a dramatic change in the mechanism of cooperative oxygen binding in a hemoglobin. The mutation Lys-30→Asp abolishes the only salt bridge (Lys-30–Asp-89) present at the two extremes of the subunit interface in native HbI (1Royer W.E., Jr. Hendrickson W.A. Chiancone E. Science. 1990; 249: 518-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 2Royer W.E., Jr. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 235: 657-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The charge repulsion introduced by the mutation destabilizes the interface, but the change is more significant than expected. Native HbI in the ferrous state is a highly stable dimer characterized by a dimerization free energy of −10.5 kcal/mol (K 1,2 L = 6 × 107m−1) for the oxygenated derivative (14Royer W.E., Jr. Fox R.A. Smith F.R. Zhu D. Braswell E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5689-5694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The stability of the deoxygenated derivative is even higher, such that a direct measurement of the equilibrium constant is not feasible by analytical ultracentrifugation methods. The K30D mutation leads to a 106-fold decrease in the value ofK 1,2 L in the oxygenated derivative,i.e. to an 8–9 kcal/mol increase in the free energy of dimerization with respect to the native protein (14Royer W.E., Jr. Fox R.A. Smith F.R. Zhu D. Braswell E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5689-5694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). In the deoxygenated derivative, the decrease of the dimerization constant is such that it can be measured accurately by means of sedimentation equilibrium experiments (K 1,2 D = 8 × 104m−1). It is noteworthy that the fine structure of the heme pocket appears to be unaffected by the mutation. In fact, the CD and absorption spectra of both the deoxy and oxygenated derivatives are superimposable to those of the native protein (Fig. 1) and do not change even at high dilution (0.1 μm), at which the mutated protein is essentially monomeric (>95%) even in the deoxygenated state. In particular, the unusually intense band at 590 nm (Qo band) in the visible spectrum of the deoxygenated derivative is identical in K30D HbI and in the native protein. This feature, which is paralleled by an unusually high ellipticity of the Qo band also in the CD spectrum, has been ascribed to the lowering of the C4v heme symmetry; it reflects the strain induced by the Phe-97 residue on the iron proximal histidine linkage (13Antonini E. Ascoli F. Brunori M. Chiancone E. Verzili D. Morris R.J. Gibson Q.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 6730-6738Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The persistence of the Qo band in the high dilution spectrum of deoxygenated K30D HbI indicates that monomerization, though accompanied by exposure of the heme edge to the solvent, does not alter the stereochemistry of the heme pocket. The same reasoning applies to the spectra of the liganded derivatives. The identity of the CD and absorption spectra therefore demonstrates the very high similarity in the tertiary structure of native HbI and of the K30D mutant in both the ligated and the unligated derivatives. In contrast, the dependence of oxygen affinity and cooperativity on protein concentration, which reflects the linkage between oxygen binding and the association-dissociation equilibria, differs in the two proteins. In native HbI, oxygen affinity decreases upon an increase in protein concentration up to about 2–3 μm, and cooperativity increases in a similar fashion; a further increase in concentration has no effect on oxygen affinity and cooperativity (14Royer W.E., Jr. Fox R.A. Smith F.R. Zhu D. Braswell E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5689-5694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). In K30D HbI, oxygen affinity steadily decreases upon increase in protein concentration (Fig. 3 A), whereas cooperativity passes through a maximum around 4–8 × 10−4m heme (Fig. 3 B). The linkage scheme proposed by Royer et al. (14Royer W.E., Jr. Fox R.A. Smith F.R. Zhu D. Braswell E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5689-5694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) for native HbI (see “Experimental Procedures”), when applied to the K30D mutant, brings out that the different behavior of the two proteins at high concentrations is accounted for by intriguing differences in the values of the thermodynamic parameters. The oxygen binding properties of native HbI at very high dilution and of the K30D mutant below 12 μm concentrations are indicative of the presence of a ligand-linked monomer-dimer equilibrium. In native HbI, monomer formation occurs at submicromolar concentrations and is readily identified by an increase in oxygen affinity accompanied by a decrease in cooperativity (14Royer W.E., Jr. Fox R.A. Smith F.R. Zhu D. Braswell E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5689-5694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, at concentrations higher than 2 μm, at which both the liganded and unliganded species are fully dimeric, the native protein displays high cooperativity withn 50 = 1.5. Cooperative ligand binding at equilibrium is fully explained in terms of a simple two-site Adair scheme with apparent binding constants of 0.044 (K 1) and 0.39 (K 2) torr−1, respectively. In the K30D mutant, the fitting of the oxygen equilibrium data to the linkage scheme reveals unexpected consequences on the fitted values of the Adair constants for the first (K 1) and second (K 2) oxygenation step. In fact, K 1 andK 2 converge to about the same value of about 0.038 torr−1, corresponding to the low affinity asymptote of the Hill plot. The 10-fold increase in the overall oxygen affinity at low protein concentrations can be accounted for entirely by the dissociation of the low affinity dimers into high affinity monomers. This is in contrast with native HbI, where theK 1/K 2 ratio of about 10 is indicative of a higher oxygen affinity of the monoligated dimer with respect to the unligated species (13Antonini E. Ascoli F. Brunori M. Chiancone E. Verzili D. Morris R.J. Gibson Q.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 6730-6738Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Ikeda-Saito M. Yonetani T. Chiancone E. Ascoli F. Verzili D. Antonini E. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 170: 1009-1018Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In the K30D mutant, therefore, cooperativity is no longer based on intradimer heme-heme communication but appears to be driven by the ligand-linked monomer dimer equilibrium. In turn, the latter mechanism of cooperativity predicts that, at protein concentrations where the liganded form contains a significant proportion of dimer, cooperativity and oxygen affinity should start to drop. The experimental data meet such a prediction (Fig. 3). A further outcome of the present thermodynamic analysis is that the monomeric species is endowed with high oxygen affinity, as proposed by Royer et al. (14Royer W.E., Jr. Fox R.A. Smith F.R. Zhu D. Braswell E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5689-5694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), for the native protein. It follows that not only the structural but also the functional properties of the native and mutated K30D monomer are identical. The different origin of cooperativity in native HbI and in the K30D mutant is apparent also in the oxygen release experiments (Fig. 4). In native HbI, the increase of the apparent first order rate constant upon decrease in oxygen saturation represents the kinetic manifestation of cooperativity, as is seen in vertebrate hemoglobins (13Antonini E. Ascoli F. Brunori M. Chiancone E. Verzili D. Morris R.J. Gibson Q.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 6730-6738Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In K30D HbI, this effect is absent. The value of the rate constant of oxygen release is centered around 100 s−1 and is independent of oxygen saturation and protein concentration. In the interpretation of this result, one must take into account the possible contribution of several factors. A major factor is that the oxygen binding or release kinetics in self-associating systems are necessarily affected by the contribution of the monomer-dimer equilibration rates. In this connection, it is worth recalling that in native ferric HbI, the rate of dimer dissociation has been estimated to be about 50–60 s−1, a value in the same range as the observed rates of oxygen release (16Spagnuolo C., De Martino F. Boffi A. Rousseau D.L. Chiancone E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20441-20445Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, it is premature to incorporate the oxygen release data of native and K30D HbI in the framework of a quantitative model that takes into account the whole set of kinetic pathways underlying the oxygen release process. Qualitatively, the lack of kinetic cooperativity can be explained if one considers that the oxygenated protein is monomeric and associates to form dimers only after oxygen dissociation. As a whole, the body of thermodynamic and kinetic data demonstrates that cooperativity in K30D HbI is driven by the dissociation of the oxygenated protein into monomers and that the heme-heme communication pathway characteristic of the native protein is no longer operative. In general terms, it is surprising that the abolition of a single, though symmetrically related, salt bridge at the dimer interface results in such a large increase in the dimerization free energy. The observed free energy difference for dimer association between the native and the mutated protein corresponds to about 8 kcal/mol (for the liganded derivative), a value that cannot be assigned simply to an electrostatic charge separation within an aqueous solvent. We attribute the large free energy difference to the disruption of the ordered network of water molecules at the interface, and more importantly, to the extensive hydration in correspondence of the juxtaposed carboxyl residues (Asp-30 and Asp-89) that face each other across the dimer interface."

Previous experiments have shown that the activity of various pol III transcription factors is regulated in the course of differentiation, induction of cellular proliferation, environmental changes (e.g. heat shock), or viral infection (reviewed in Ref. 1Palmer J.M.

Human TFIIIC can be subdivided into two components: TFIIIC1 and TFIIIC2 (2Yoshinaga S.K. Boulanger P.A. Berk A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 2440-2447Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). TFIIIC2 is a multisubunit protein required for both type 1 and type 2 promoters. It represents the DNA binding activity and consists of five polypeptides (reviewed in Ref. 4Geiduschek E.P. Kassavetis G.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 310: 1-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). TFIIIC1 likewise represents a multimeric protein of which the subunits have, however, not yet been cloned. TFIIIC1 is required as an initiation factor for the transcription of all pol III genes ((3) reviewed in Ref. 4Geiduschek E.P. Kassavetis G.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 310: 1-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar), and only the C1 component of TFIIIC is required for the expression of type 3 promoters. The exact mechanism by which TFIIIC1 is incorporated into the transcription complex and exerts its effect is not clear at present, but it has been proposed that it plays a role in the recruitment of pol III (5Kober I. Teichmann M. Seifart K.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 284: 7-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). TFIIIB is a pol III transcription factor involved essentially in initiation of transcription. It has previously been shown (6Teichmann M. Seifart K.H. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5974-5983Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 7Lobo S.M. Tanaka M. Sullivan M.L. Hernandez N.

EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5974-5983Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Human TFIIIBβ is required for transcription initiation of type 1 and type 2 pol III promoters and represents a TBP-TAF complex. TFIIIBα is a multiprotein complex that does not, however, contain TBP as an integral part; expression of type 3 promoters in vitro hence requires the addition of TBP. Although the number and identity of TAFs in human TFIIIB have not been fully established, one of the TAFs that has been characterized in some detail is TFIIIB90, which is part of the human TFIIIBβ complex. Recently, additional polypeptides of human TFIIIB have been identified: hTFIIIB′′, which is the human homologue of yeast TFIIIB component B′′ (10Teichmann M. Dieci G. Huet J. Rüth J. Sentenac A.

The aim of the work presented here was to investigate how pol III transcription is down-regulated during differentiation of F9 cells. After the induction of differentiation in these cells, it has previously been reported that the expression of pol III genes is generally impaired (14Murphy D. Brickell P.M. Latchmann D.S. Willison K. Rigby P.W.J. Cell. 1983; 35: 865-871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 15White R.J. Stott D. Rigby P.W.

Chem. 1998; 273: 17166-17171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The target protein, by which this repression of pol III transcription is mediated, is controversial in the literature. Based on the reduction of activity in the PCB fraction of differentiated cells (15White R.J. Stott D. Rigby P.W. Cell. 1989; 59: 1081-1092Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 17Alzuherri H.M. White R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17166-17171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), TFIIIB or one of its TAF components (TFIIIB90) has been considered the target for this regulation. Because TFIIIB90 is a component of TFIIIBβ but not of TFIIIBα, however, it cannot be considered as the only target by which the expression of all pol III genes, including those coding for U6 RNA, is repressed. Using extracts from F9 cells differentiatedin vitro for 5 days, we previously showed (16Meissner W. Ahlers A. Seifart K.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5888-5897Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) that the activity of phosphocellulose fraction C was reduced. Based on a more efficient purification protocol and characterization of individual components of the pol III transcription system, we show here for the first time that the activity of TFIIIC1, which is a transcription factor required for the expression of all pol III genes, is impaired during the differentiation of F9 cells. The plasmids pUVAI, pUmU60.34, and pUPDR2 contained single copies of the genes coding forVAI RNA, mouse U6 snRNA, and a TBP-DR2-dependent transcript, respectively (18Schneider H.R. Waldschmidt R.

All fractions employed were dialyzed against buffer B including 60 mm KCl before use, except for the polymerase fraction (see below). After dialysis, the total protein concentration of each fraction was determined by a colorimetric protein assay (Bio-Rad). Cytoplasmic extract from human embryonic kidney cells (HEK S100) was prepared as described by Weil et al. (21Weil P.A. Segall J., Ng, S.Y. Roeder R.G. J. Biol.

The PCC fraction (350 mm-600 mm KCl) was used to prepare human TFIIIC1, TFIIIC1-like, TFIIIC2, and PBP as described previously (3Oettel S. Härtel F. Kober I. Iben S. Seifart K.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 2440-2447Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. The PCC fraction was dialyzed against buffer B containing 60 mm KCl and loaded onto a MonoQ column (MQ, Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) at 5 mg of protein/ml of bed volume. After washing the column with the same buffer, bound proteins were eluted with a linear gradient from 60 to 450 mm KCl. Fractions eluting at 300–330 mmKCl contained PBP and were devoid of TFIIIC1 and TFIIIC2 as well as TFIIIBα and RNA pol III. TFIIIC2 activity eluted from 350 to 380 mm KCl and was devoid of TFIIIC1, TFIIIBβ, and RNA pol III. Fractions eluting from 250 to 290 mmKCl in buffer B from MonoQ (see above) were diluted to 200 mm KCl in buffer B and applied to an EMD-SO 3−-Fractogel column (ESF; Merck, Darmstadt) at 5 mg of protein/ml of bed volume. After the column was washed with 200 mm KCl in buffer B, bound proteins were eluted with a linear gradient from 200 to 600 mm KCl and a 1 m KCl step. hTFIIIC1 activity eluted from this column from 450 to 500 mm KCl. Fractions eluting from 150 to 190 mm KCl in buffer B from the MQ gradient (TFIIIC0) (3Oettel S. Härtel F. Kober I. Iben S. Seifart K.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 2440-2447Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) were applied to an EMD-SO 3−-Fractogel column at 5 mg protein/ml bed volume. After washing the column with 200 mmKCl in buffer B, bound proteins were eluted with a linear gradient from 200 to 600 mm KCl. TFIIIC1-like activity eluted from 500 to 550 mm KCl. The activity, which stimulates U6transcription (TFIIIU), eluted from 360 to 420 mmKCl. The PCB fraction (350 mm KCl) was used to prepare TFIIIBα, TFIIIBβ, and RNA pol III by EMD-DEAE-Fractogel chromatography (EDF; Merck, Darmstadt) as described (3Oettel S. Härtel F. Kober I. Iben S. Seifart K.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 2440-2447Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 10Teichmann M. Dieci G. Huet J. Rüth J. Sentenac A. Seifart K.H. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4708-4716Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). TFIIIBβ was further purified by EMD-SO 3−-Fractogel chromatography as described (3Oettel S. Härtel F. Kober I. Iben S. Seifart K.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 2440-2447Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The polymerase fraction was also applied to EMD-SO 3−-Fractogel and was step-eluted. The polymerase activity eluted in the 400–650 mm KCl fraction and was free of TFIIIBβ, TFIIIC1, and TFIIIC2activities. 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin was added, and the polymerase fraction was diluted with glycerol to a final concentration of 50% (v/v) glycerol. All fractions were stored at −80 °C. Recombinant human wild-type TBP and TBP-DR2 were expressed inEscherichia coli and purified as described (20Meissner W. Rothfels H. Schäfer B. Seifart K.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 1672-1682Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 23Waldschmidt R. Seifart K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16359-16364Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). F9 EC cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 1% (v/v) penicillin-streptomycin solution (100 units/ml), and 3.7 mg of sodium hydrogen carbonate/ml. Every 2 to 3 days, cells were split by a factor of 1:5 to 1:10, seeded into new tissue culture flasks, pretreated with a sterile 1% gelatin solution. Differentiation was induced by the addition of 10−3m retinoic acid, 10−3m cAMP, and 10−4m 3-isobutyl-l-methylxanthine (all from Sigma) in the same medium. Every 2 days, the medium containing the above mentioned additives was changed, and cells (PE) were harvested after 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 days, respectively. The in vitro transcription mixtures contained the appropriate protein fractions, 1 μg of plasmid DNA, 600 μm ATP, CTP, and UTP, 30 μm GTP, 3 μCi of [α-32P]GTP (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.), 20 units of ribonuclease inhibitor (RNase Block, Stratagene), 60 mmKCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 10% glycerol, and 5 mm MgCl2 in a final volume of 50 μl. After a 90-min incubation at 30 °C, the RNA was purified and loaded onto a denaturing 7 m urea, 6% polyacrylamide gel. The gel was analyzed by autoradiography with intensifying screens and for quantitative analysis by a Fuji FLA-3000 BioImaging Analyzer. To investigate the regulation of pol III-mediated gene expression in the course of differentiation of F9 embryonal carcinoma cells (EC) to parietal endoderm (PE), cellular extracts were prepared from such cells at various time points (3, 4, 5, and 6 days) after induction of differentiation by cAMP/retinoic acid, referred to in this article as PE(3), PE(4), PE(5), and PE(6) (see “Experimental Procedures”). The transcriptional activity of these extracts, analyzed by in vitro transcription of theVAI gene as template, was compared with that of an extract from undifferentiated EC cells. The results in Fig.1 show that the decrease of pol III transcription upon differentiation of F9 cells is a slow process reaching its maximum after 5 to 6 days. Three days after induction of differentiation, microscopic inspection revealed changes of the cellular morphology, which was accompanied by the reduction of transcriptional activity to about 75% of the levels detected with EC cell extracts (Fig. 1, compare lanes 1 and 2). Four days after addition of cAMP/retinoic acid, the transcriptional activity reached 30% of that in EC cells (compare lanes 1and 5). After day 6 of differentiation a further change was observed in morphology (compact cells with long extremities). At this time point virtually no transcriptional activity (2%, lane 11) was observed in the extract of these cells. It was possible, however, to reactivate these extracts by the addition of partially purified phosphocellulose fractions PCB (lanes 3, 6, 9, and 12) and PCC (lanes 4, 7,10, and 13) obtained from human cells (“Experimental Procedures”). In the course of these experiments it was observed that although fraction PCB partly restored transcription, supplementation with fraction PCC always led to a significantly higher degree of stimulation (see TableI).Table IRelative transcription activity of different F9 cell extracts after supplementation with phosphocellulose fractions PCB or PCC (based on EC extract = 100%)+ PCB+ PCC%%EC100ND1-aND, not determined.NDPE(3)7580150PE(4)3060143PE(5)2860140PE(6)235851-a ND, not determined. Open table in a new tab To characterize the limiting activity in phosphocellulose fraction C, cytoplasmic extracts from PE(6) cells were supplemented with individual fractions of a PCC MonoQ gradient from HEK cells (Fig. 2). This chromatographic technique clearly separates pol III transcription factors TFIIIC1-like (IIIC0), TFIIIC1, PBP, and TFIIIC2 (3Oettel S. Härtel F. Kober I. Iben S. Seifart K.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 2440-2447Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 11Oettel S. Kober I. Seifart K.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 4324-4331Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The cytoplasmic extract (S100) from cells differentiated for 6 days (lane 1) was devoid of pol III transcription activity but could be reactivated by the addition of a PCC fraction from HEK cells (lane 26). Supplementation of the PE(6)-S100 extract with individual fractions from the PCC MonoQ gradient demonstrated the presence of two peaks of activity. The elution points of these peaks are characteristic for those of TFIIIC1-like (lane 7-9) and TFIIIC1 (lanes 13–16), whereas fractions of the gradient containing TFIIIC2 (lanes 20–23) revealed no stimulation. The effects of purified TFIIIC1-like (IIIC0), TFIIIC1, TFIIIC2, and hTFIIIBβ were analyzed more systematically in S100 extracts from EC cells (lanes 1–11) as well as from PE(4) (lanes 12–22) and PE(6) cells (lanes 23–33). The results shown in Fig. 3 A were quantitatively evaluated in Fig. 3 B. It is evident that the reactivation of transcription activity in PE(4)- and PE(6)-S100 was observed mainly by fractions containing TFIIIC1 (lanes 16and 17 and 27 and 28) or TFIIIC1-like (lanes 13–15 and 24–26) but not by TFIIIC2 (lanes 22 and 33). Supplementation with increasing amounts of the IIIBβ fraction alone did not significantly stimulate transcription in extracts from PE(4) cells (lanes 18–20) and only moderately stimulated transcription in extracts from PE(6) cells (lanes 29–31). Quantitative evaluation of the results (Fig. 3 B) showed that TFIIIC1-containing fractions mediated only a small effect on transcription when added to S100 extracts from EC cells. In contrast, the addition of 2 μg of TFIIIC1 to S100 extracts from PE cells differentiated for 4 days stimulated transcription by about 10-fold (Fig. 3 B). Under these conditions, the addition of 5 μg of TFIIIBβ alone had no effect, and the pairwise addition of 5 μg of TFIIIBβ and 2 μg of TFIIIC1 only reached the level of TFIIIC1 alone (about 11-fold; Fig. 3 B). The situation was somewhat different when extracts from cells differentiated for 6 days were examined. The addition of 2 μg of TFIIIC1 led to a 40-fold increase of transcription. If added simultaneously with 5 μg of TFIIIBβ, the degree of stimulation even rose to 60-fold. These results indicate that up to 4 days of differentiation, cells are not deficient in TFIIIB activity, whereas TFIIIC1 (or TFIIIC1-like) is clearly the limiting factor. At day 6 of differentiation, TFIIIBβ also becomes limiting because the combined supplementation with purified TFIIIBβ and TFIIIC1 leads to a stimulation exceeding that achieved with TFIIIC1 alone (Fig.3 B). The relationship between the addition of TFIIIBβ and TFIIIC1 was investigated in more detail by comparing the activities of extracts from cells differentiated for 6 (Fig.4 A, lanes 2–7) and 7 days (lanes 8–15). The results confirmed that transcription in S100 extracts was significantly reduced after 6 days (lane 2) and was virtually abolished after 7 days. Even higher amounts of extract did not yield a detectable signal (lanes 8–10). Transcription in these extracts could be reactivated efficiently by the addition of purified TFIIIC1 (lanes 5 and 13) but not by purified TFIIIBβ alone (∼2-fold, lanes 6 and14). Quantitative evaluation of these experiments (Fig.4 B) showed that the stimulating effect of simultaneously adding TFIIIC1 and TFIIIBβ was even more pronounced in extracts prepared at day 7 than it was in extracts from day 6 PE cells. This indicates that TFIIIBβ activity declines more slowly and only becomes limiting after day 6, whereas that of TFIIIC1 is already limiting at day 4. At day 7 of differentiation microscopic examination revealed a partial necrosis of the cells, and to avoid possible artifacts, all subsequent experiments were conducted after 6 days of differentiation. From the results presented in Fig. 1 it was deduced that phosphocellulose fraction B was capable of partially complementing transcription activity in extracts from differentiating F9 cells. In contrast, the results shown in Figs. 3 and 4 demonstrate that purified TFIIIBβ was not primarily the limiting component. Because this issue is a subject of controversy in the literature (15White R.J. Stott D. Rigby P.W. Cell. 1989; 59: 1081-1092Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 16Meissner W. Ahlers A. Seifart K.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5888-5897Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 17Alzuherri H.M. White R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17166-17171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), we further purified the PCB fraction by EDF anion exchange chromatography and subsequently by cation exchange chromatography on ESF gradients. Individual fractions were analyzed in two separate experimental conditions assaying for the activity of either TFIIIC1 (Fig.5 A) or TFIIIBβ (Fig.5 B), respectively. The same protein fractions were also tested for their ability to reconstitute transcription in extracts from differentiated F9 cells. The results clearly showed that the reconstituting activity co-elutes with the activity of TFIIIC1 (corresponding to fraction 12 of the gradient, 450–480 mmKCl) but not with the activity of TFIIIBβ (fractions 2, 4, and 6, 290–360 mm KCl). Characterization of fractions of this gradient by immunoblots (data not shown) revealed that TBP eluted in fraction 4, which corresponds to the elution point of TFIIIBβ, whereas fraction 12, corresponding to TFIIIC1, was devoid of TBP. These results indicate that phosphocellulose fraction B and TFIIIBβ eluted from EDF are contaminated with TFIIIC1 activity. In contrast, the TFIIIC1 fraction, eluted from MQ, is devoid of TFIIIBβ (data not shown). We have previously shown that differentiation of F9 cells also led to a drastic impairment of U6 gene transcription, which could be reactivated by supplementation with phosphocellulose fraction C (16Meissner W. Ahlers A. Seifart K.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5888-5897Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). These results were confirmed and extended by the data presented in Fig.6, documenting that only the TFIIIC1 fraction (lanes 14–16) was able to substantially restoreU6 transcription in extracts obtained from PE(6) cells (lanes 9–16) or PE(4) cells (data not shown). TFIIIU, PBP, or TFIIIBα alone (lanes 10–12) were not able to reactivate U6 transcription in extracts from cells differentiated for 6 days. However, the possibility cannot be excluded that one or more of these factors may also be limiting, because in the absence of sufficient quantities of TFIIIC1 such a conceivable deficit would remain undetected. In agreement with our previous results (6Teichmann M. Seifart K.H. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5974-5983Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), the addition of TFIIIBβ had no effect onU6 transcription (lanes 5 and 13), and hence TAF TFIIIB90 cannot be the limiting component for transcription of the U6 gene in PE cells. Because it has been reported (17Alzuherri H.M. White R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17166-17171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) that TBP also declined during F9 differentiation, we investigated this question by experiments using a variant type 3 promoter, which is not recognized by wild-type TBP (Fig. 6, lanes 17–28). This promoter instead essentially requires a mutant form of TBP (TBP-DR2), whereas all of the remaining transcription factors (TFIIIBα, PBP, TFIIIC1, and TFIIIU) are identical to those involved in the expression of theU6 gene (20Meissner W. Rothfels H. Schäfer B. Seifart K.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 1672-1682Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Using the TBP-DR2-dependent promoter, we were able to analyze the transcription of 5′-regulated pol III genes regardless of the endogenous TBP activity in the F9 extracts. The results showed that in the absence of TBP-DR2 no transcription was observed in extracts from EC (lanes 17 and 18) or PE(6) cells (lanes 23 and 24). The addition of TBP-DR2 resulted in transcription of this construct by EC extracts (lane 19) but not by PE(6) extracts (lane 25). These results demonstrate that TBP is not the limiting component in PE extracts, which required additional complementation with a TFIIIC1 fraction for active transcription (lanes 26–28). Supplementation experiments with purified human transcription factors from HEK cells identified TFIIIC1 as the limiting component in cellular extracts derived from differentiated F9 cells (Fig. Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4 and 6). To further compare the activities of TFIIIBβ, TFIIIC1, and TFIIIC2 in EC versusPE cells, the transcription factors were purified from these cells on an analytical scale. For this purpose 150 mg of cytoplasmic extracts from EC and PE(6) cells were purified according to the established protocol. After phosphocellulose chromatography, step-eluted fractions PCA (100 mm KCl), PCB (350 mm KCl), PCC (600 mm KCl), and PCD (1 m KCl) were obtained. The resulting PCB fractions, which contained TFIIIBβ as well as RNA polymerase III, were dialyzed against buffer B and chromatographed in parallel on EDF anion exchange columns eluted with a gradient from 60 to 450 mm KCl (BEDF). Fig. 7,A and B, reveals the activity of different fractions of the gradient in appropriately reconstituted in vitro transcription systems. The results clearly show that activity is found in a region of the gradient associated with TFIIIBβ (∼270 mm KCl) in both cases. The experiment is based on two parallel column runs, and comparative quantitation is possible therefore only as a first approximation. Based on the positive controls (lanes 13 in Fig. 7, A and B) it can be estimated that TFIIIBβ is reduced about 2-fold, demonstrating that TFIIIBβ (or one of its components) is certainly not inactivated in these cells. The phosphocellulose fractions containing TFIIIC1 and TFIIIC2 from EC and PE(6) cells were further purified by MonoQ anion exchange chromatography according to the established purification scheme and tested for activity in complementation assays. The multiprotein complex TFIIIC2 could be isolated from both cell types with comparable activity (compare lanes 4–6 in Fig. 8,A and B). In contrast, transcriptionally active TFIIIC1 could only be isolated from undifferentiated EC cells and not from corresponding fractions obtained from cells differentiated for 6 days (compare lanes 6–8 in Fig. 8, C andD). These results clearly show the lack of TFIIIC1 activity in PCC MonoQ fractions of differentiated cells and confirm the results obtained from the above mentioned supplementation experiments. In the course of in vitro differentiation of F9 embryonal carcinoma cells to parietal endoderm, pol III expression progressively declines. This down-regulation can be monitored byin vitro transcription in extracts from cells differentiated for various time periods, and 6 days after induction of differentiation it reaches a residual level of only ∼2% in comparison to that of the undifferentiated cells (Fig. 1). It could previously be shown that all class III genes are affected by this process (15White R.J. Stott D. Rigby P.W. Cell. 1989; 59: 1081-1092Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 16Meissner W. Ahlers A. Seifart K.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5888-5897Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). TFIIIB (or one of its TAFs) was discussed previously as the main target through which this transcription regulation is mediated (15White R.J. Stott D. Rigby P.W. Cell. 1989; 59: 1081-1092Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 17Alzuherri H.M. White R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17166-17171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Alzuherri and White (17Alzuherri H.M. White R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17166-17171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) investigated cells that were differentiated for periods of 5–9 days and found that extracts from these cells could be reactivated by ∼5-fold by a TAF-containing fraction obtained by chromatography of a PCB fraction over immobilized TBP. According to these authors (17Alzuherri H.M. White R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17166-17171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) this fraction still revealed multiple polypeptides upon silver staining so that the identity of the stimulating activity remained uncertain in these studies. Because our complementation experiments showed that reactivation of transcription in these extracts could be obtained with both phosphocellulose fractions B and C, the question remained whether TFIIIB is the only component involved. By supplementation with highly purified pol III transcription factors, we attempted to clarify this question. Our results (Figs. 2 and 3) show for the first time that the addition of highly purified TFIIIC1 is able to substantially reactivate the impaired transcription activity in extracts of differentiated F9 cells. These results thus prove that TFIIIC1 is the main limiting activity for pol III-mediated transcription in these extracts, particularly in the early stages of differentiation. These results are only apparently in contrast to those of Alzuherri and White (17Alzuherri H.M. White R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17166-17171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), who reported a lack of reactivation of PE extracts after the addition of affinity-purified TFIIIC. The discrepancy between their study and our results can readily be reconciled by the fact that the B-box binding component only reflects TFIIIC2, and therefore no conclusions can be drawn with regard to the activity of TFIIIC1 in the different extracts. Our results also document that TFIIIC2 was not able to reactivate transcription in extracts of differentiated cells (Figs.2 and 3) and hence was not limiting in PE cells. Previous investigations showed a reduction of the binding activity of TFIIIC and PBP in phosphocellulose fraction C of differentiated F9 cells (16Meissner W. Ahlers A. Seifart K.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5888-5897Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). This crude fraction contains TFIIIC1 in addition to the DNA-binding components TFIIIC2 and PBP, and because TFIIIC1 enhances the specific formation of protein-DNA complexes (3Oettel S. Härtel F. Kober I. Iben S. Seifart K.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 2440-2447Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 24Wang Z. Roeder R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6841-6850Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), the reduction of the TFIIIC1 activity in the course of differentiation can therefore also lead to a reduced formation of specific protein DNA complexes. In agreement with previously published data (17Alzuherri H.M. White R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17166-17171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), we found that extracts from differentiated cells can be stimulated ∼2–5-fold by a crude PCB fraction from HEK cells. Further purification revealed that the stimulating activity in the PCB fraction co-elutes with TFIIIBβ upon anion exchange chromatography but could be separated from TFIIIBβ by subsequent cation exchange chromatography (ESF, Fig. 5,A–C). The fractions that reactivate pol III-mediated transcription in extracts from PE cells show TFIIIC1 activity in a reconstituted transcription system and, more importantly, contain no TFIIIBβ as evidenced by Western blot against TBP (data not shown). The presence of TFIIIC1 activity in the PCB fraction was previously reported and was defined as TFIIIC1′ or TFIIIB1, respectively (24Wang Z. Roeder R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6841-6850Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The TFIIIB fraction used by Alzuherri and White (17Alzuherri H.M. White R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17166-17171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) to reconstitute transcription in differentiated F9 cells was purified by anion exchange chromatography (MonoQ), but the preparation is not described in detail in this paper. Instead, reference is made to an earlier paper from their laboratory (25White R.J. Gottlieb T.M. Downes C.S. Jackson S.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1983-1992Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) according to which the TFIIIB fraction was obtained by elution with an 0.48–0.56 m KCl from a MonoQ gradient. It is generally agreed, however, that this protein fraction does not represent the TBP-TAF components TFIIIB90 of TFIIIBβ (6Teichmann M. Seifart K.H. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5974-5983Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 7Lobo S.M. Tanaka M. Sullivan M.L. Hernandez N.

EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2749-2762Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 9Mital R. Kobayashi R. Hernandez N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 7031-7042Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Importantly, these authors (17Alzuherri H.M. White R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17166-17171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) have not investigated the role of TFIIIC1 in their system, and therefore a direct comparison with our results is not possible. The results from the complementation assays utilizing purified TFIIIBβ require particular attention. We used a highly purified TFIIIBβ fraction, which was free of contaminating TFIIIC1 activity, and showed that it had at most a 2-fold stimulating effect on pol III-mediated transcription in PE extracts (Figs. 3 and 4). Particularly in earlier stages of differentiation (until day 4), down-regulation of pol III transcription can almost be fully compensated by the re-addition of purified TFIIIC1 alone. Thus, TFIIIBβ does not appear to be the main limitation of transcriptional capacity in early differentiation stages. At day 6 of differentiation, the addition of both TFIIIBβ and TFIIIC1 leads to a significantly higher degree of stimulation than observed with TFIIIC1 alone (60- versus40-fold). This effect is even more pronounced at day 7 of differentiation (Fig. 4 B). These results demonstrate that TFIIIC1 is the limiting component for pol III-mediated transcription during early stages of F9 cell differentiation and suggest that at later stages the activity of TFIIIBβ is also reduced. TFIIIBβ (or one of its TAFs) has been described to be the target by which regulation of pol III expression is achieved in other experimental systems. For example, by using murine fibroblasts either containing or lacking the retinoblastoma protein (Rb), it was demonstrated that Rb represses transcription of all class III genes (tRNA, 5S rRNA, U6 snRNA,VAI, EBER2) (26White R.J. Trouche D. Martin K. Jackson S.P. Kouzarides T. Nature. 1996; 382: 88-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). In these experiments, modulation of TFIIIB activity was monitored by co-immunoprecipitation of IIIB subunits with Rb. A comparable mechanism has also been reported for the repression of pol III-mediated gene expression by p53 (27Cairns C.A. White R.J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3112-3123Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Recent experiments conducted to clarify the regulation of pol III expression after cell cycle arrest in G1 or G2/M also identified TFIIIB90 as the target peptide (28Eichhorn K. Jackson S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21158-21165Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). In contrast to the Rb-mediated repression of pol III-transcribed genes, the inactivation of TFIIIB90 by p53 does not result from a direct p53-TFIIIB90 interaction, as suggested by Cairns and White (27Cairns C.A. White R.J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3112-3123Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), but rather from a degradation of TFIIIB90 through the ubiquitin-dependent proteasome pathway (28Eichhorn K. Jackson S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21158-21165Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). In summary, the data demonstrate that several mechanisms evolved that regulate pol III-mediated gene expression during the course of development, differentiation, and proliferation. Although TFIIIB remains incompletely characterized in higher organisms, there is general consensus that different TFIIIB complexes are required for the transcription of type 2 and type 3 pol III promoters. In previous studies addressing the regulation of pol III-transcribed genes, the different protein complexes TFIIIBα and TFIIIBβ have thus far been incompletely considered. Expression of the U6snRNA gene is clearly repressed in the course of differentiation of F9 cells (16Meissner W. Ahlers A. Seifart K.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5888-5897Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), and it has recently been reported that TFIIIB90 levels decrease substantially in the course of this process (17Alzuherri H.M. White R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17166-17171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). According to these authors, the decrease in the abundance of this essential TAF seems sufficient to account for the down-regulation of class III gene expression that accompanies PE formation. However, because TFIIIB90 is not required for the transcription of type 3 pol III promoters (6Teichmann M. Seifart K.H. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5974-5983Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 10Teichmann M. Dieci G. Huet J. Rüth J. Sentenac A. Seifart K.H. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4708-4716Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 13Teichmann M. Wang Z. Roeder R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 14200-14205Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 29Chong S.S., Hu, P. Hernandez N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20727-20734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), the down-regulation of these genes cannot be mediated by a mere inactivation of TFIIIB90. Therefore, repression of all pol III genes during PE formation must necessarily involve additional components, and we show here (Fig. 6) that TFIIIC1 restores U6 transcription in PE cell extracts. We have also studied the role of endogenous TBP in the course of F9 cell differentiation. By using a pol III promoter construct, which does not depend on wild-type TBP for its expression but instead utilizes a mutant form of TBP, we could show that TFIIIC1 but not TBP accounts for the down-regulation of the type 3 gene expression that accompanies PE formation. In addition to RNA polymerase III and TBP, TFIIIC1 is essential for the transcription of all pol III genes including those regulated by 5′-located promoter elements (3Oettel S. Härtel F. Kober I. Iben S. Seifart K.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 2440-2447Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 30Yoon J.B. Murphy S. Bai L. Wang Z. Roeder R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2019-2027Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The partial purification of the individual pol III transcription factors from EC and PE cells clearly shows a lack of TFIIIC1 activity in the extracts of differentiated cells. The reactivation of pol III transcription in PE extracts by complementation with TFIIIC1 is therefore not an indirect effect but shows that TFIIIC1 activity is lacking in these cells, whereas TFIIIBβ and TFIIIC2 remain active during the differentiation process. The molecular architecture of TFIIIC1 has hitherto not been deciphered, and its potential interactions with components of TFIIIB (e.g. TFIIIB150 as a subunit of TFIIIBβ and TFIIIBα) and/or pol III hence remain speculative. Future cloning of the subunits of TFIIIC1 will allow a direct quantitation of TFIIIC1 and its subunits by reverse transcription-PCR or Western blot analysis and will therefore be of particular importance.
