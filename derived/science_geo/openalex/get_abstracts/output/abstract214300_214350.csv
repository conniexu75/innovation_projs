https://openalex.org/W1991709537,"IT is now well established that the thymus plays an important part in the development of immunological competence in mammals. For example, in the mouse, removal of the thymus within the first 24 h after birth results in a serious impairment of the capacity to produce circulating antibody and the ability to reject allogeneic grafts of normal or neoplastic tissues. In addition, these mice also develop a wasting syndrome ending in early death1–7. Surgical ablation of the thymus at 6 and up to 35 days of age also produces a state of immunological impairment, which is more severe when thymectomy is performed earlier in life. These animals do not develop the wasting syndrome and have a life-span comparable with that of non-thymectomized controls8–10."

Boyd3 maintains that each type of muscle fibre receives its own pattern of innervation, there being, in particular, a segregation in the size distribution of the fusimotor supply. However, earlier work by one of us4 described spindles in the quadriceps femoris of the rabbit which did not show this structural duality, since they were composed of nuclear-bag fibres only. We wished to ascertain the validity of this observation, and to determine the extent to which the muscle-fibre content of cat spindles represents the typical mammalian condition."

https://openalex.org/W2033549180,"THYMECTOMY in the new-born1,2 or in the adult irradiated mouse3 leads to a long-lasting suppression of the ability to respond to primary antigenic challenge. It has been shown in both instances that thymus grafting is effective in restoring immunological competence2,4,5 and, furthermore, when using a cytologically marked thymic graft, it has been possible to detect cells derived from the graft in the spleen and lymph nodes2,5. It has, therefore, been suggested5 that it may be these donor cells which are directly responsible for the recovery of the primary immune response in thymus-grafted animals."

https://openalex.org/W2013689679,"IN spite of a rapidly mounting literature on the problem of specific antigens in human neoplasms, there have been few attempts to separate these antigens in amounts permitting biochemical and immunological analyses of the same. Such analyses not only would shed light on carcinogenic mechanisms, including possibly the serological back-tracking of eventual biological agents, but would make possible a much-desired immunological classification of tumours. Work from this laboratory has been concentrated on such efforts."
https://openalex.org/W2052031923,"OBSERVATIONS of coloured areas using the stabilized retinal image (an image which remains stationary on the retina despite eye movements) have produced reports of gradual desaturation of colours1, or of colour fusion if bipartite coloured fields are used2. When black and white geometrical shapes are examined, a marked loss of contrast occurs, with ultimate failure of perception over parts or the whole of the visual field3. The examination of targets in which colour gradations and major pattern variations occur simultaneously has, however, not been reported; and it is not easy to predict the phenomena which might be expected to occur in these conditions."

https://openalex.org/W2001608011,"WE have recently obtained information from work on normal subjects and mild and severe diabetics indicating that insulin has an increasing effect on hepatic glucose metabolism in untreated diabetics with progressively elevated fasting blood sugar-levels and glycosuria implying greater degrees of catabolism and gluconeogenesis1. There is also evidence of a hepatic action of insulin when diabetic patients are treated with phenethylbiguanide2. In view of the similarity between the ethylbiguanide side-chain and the nucleotides adenine and guanine, we wished to test the effect of these compounds on hepatic carbohydrate metabolism and on the action of insulin on the liver."

This confirmed the findings of several other workers3,4."

https://openalex.org/W1963580945,"WE have previously described experiments showing that the apparent position of a sound source in space can be moved about the horizontal plane if sound is additionally fed by a single headphone to one ear1; the magnitude of this apparent movement depends largely on the frequency and intensity relations between the loudspeaker and headphone sounds. As we investigated this phenomenon, which we regard as an example of binaural interaction, we noticed that if two headphones were used instead of one a single sound image was perceived the apparent distance of which from the listener could be controlled by changing loudspeaker-to-headphone loudness relations. The work recorded here examines this illusion of distance more closely."

A precision wood-working firm was commissioned to make similar cages in large numbers. On their advice, mahogany plywood, exterior grade, was used, and the cages surface-sprayed with a melamine resin which would seal the wood against absorption of faeces and facilitate the washing of dirty boxes."
