Although Alzheimer's disease-associated mutations in the homologous presenilin (PS2) gene elevate amyloid β-peptide (Aβ42) production like PS1 mutations, here we demonstrate that a gene ablation of PS2 (unlike that of PS1) in mice does not result in a severe phenotype resembling that of Notch-ablated animals. To investigate the amyloidogenic function of PS2 more directly, we mutagenized a conserved aspartate at position 366 to alanine, because the corresponding residue of PS1 is known to be required for its amyloidogenic function. Cells expressing the PS2 D366A mutation exhibit significant deficits in proteolytic processing of β-amyloid precursor protein indicating a defect in γ-secretase activity. The reduced γ-secretase activity results in the almost complete inhibition of Aβ and p3 production in cells stably expressing PS2 D366A, whereas cells overexpressing the wild-type PS2 cDNA produce robust levels of Aβ and p3. Using highly sensitive in vivo assays, we demonstrate that the PS2 D366A mutation not only blocks γ-secretase activity but also inactivates PS2 activity in Notch signaling by inhibiting the proteolytic release of the cytoplasmic Notch1 domain. These data suggest that PS2 is functionally involved in Aβ production and Notch signaling by facilitating similar proteolytic cleavages.

Recent evidence demonstrated a deficiency in γ-secretase activity in mice lacking thePS1 gene (1De Strooper B. Saftig P. Craessaerts K. Vanderstichele H. Guhde G. Annaert W. Von Figura K. Van Leuven F. Nature. 1998; 391: 387-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (1548) Google Scholar). Neurons isolated from these animals secreted reduced levels of Aβ and accumulated the C-terminal fragments of βAPP, which are normally proteolyzed by γ-secretase (1De Strooper B. Saftig P. Craessaerts K. Vanderstichele H. Guhde G. Annaert W. Von Figura K. Van Leuven F. Nature. 1998; 391: 387-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (1548) Google Scholar). Moreover, mice lacking PS1 exhibit a phenotype, which resembles that caused by the deletion of the Notch1gene (3Shen J. Bronson R.T. Chen D.F. Xia W. Selkoe D.J. Tonegawa S.

A direct involvement of PS1 in Notch signaling has now been demonstrated by the finding that cells lacking PS1 show reduced levels of the proteolytically generated cytoplasmic domain of Notch1 (Notch intracellular domain (NICD)) (5De Strooper B.

Nature. 1999; 398: 513-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (1685) Google Scholar) recently suggested that PS1 might be an unusual aspartyl protease, which exhibits the γ-secretase activity required for the proteolytic release of Aβ. Mutagenizing either one of the two critical Asp residues in transmembrane domain 6 or transmembrane domain 7 of PS1 inhibits Aβ production and results in the accumulation of C-terminal fragments of βAPP (10Wolfe M.S. Xia W. Ostaszewski B.L. Diehl T.S. Kimberly W.T. Selkoe D.J. Nature. 1999; 398: 513-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (1685) Google Scholar). The biochemical phenotype caused by this mutation therefore closely resembles the effects of the PS1 ablation on Aβ production (1De Strooper B. Saftig P. Craessaerts K. Vanderstichele H. Guhde G.

Interestingly, PS2 mutations elevate Aβ42 generation like PS1 mutations (11Selkoe D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18295-18298Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (758) Google Scholar). However, Alzheimer's disease-associated mutations in PS2 are very rare, whereas numerous mutations have been reported in thePS1 gene. Moreover, PS2 mutations appear to be less aggressive and in contrast to PS1 the age of onset caused by PS2 mutations is apparently modified by the apoE phenotype (12Hutton M. Hardy J. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1997; 6: 1639-1646Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). To understand the biological function of PS2, we analyzed the phenotype of PS2 deleted mice. We also generated a loss function mutation and investigated its influence on Aβ generation, NICD production, and Notch signaling in cultured cells and in a sensitive functional rescuing assay in C. elegans. From our experiments we conclude that loss of function mutations of PS2 interfere with Aβ production as well as Notch signaling, suggesting that PS2 is functionally involved in the proteolytic release of Aβ and NICD. Human embryonic kidney 293 cells (293) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, 200 μg/ml G418 (to select for βAPP expression), and 200 μg/ml zeocin (to select for presenilin expression). 293 cells stably expressing PS2 D366A were generated by transfection of 293 cells stably expressing βAPP containing the Swedish mutation (13Citron M.

The cDNA encoding PS2 D366A was constructed by polymerase chain reaction-mediated mutagenesis of codon 366 of the PS2 cDNA (15Levy-Lahad E. Wasco W. Poorkaj P. Romano D.M. Oshima J.

The mutant cDNA was cloned into expression vector pcDNA3.1 containing a zeocin resistance gene (Invitrogen) and sequenced to verify successful mutagenesis. The polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies against amino acids 263–407 of PS1 (3027, BI.3D7) and against amino acids 297–356 of PS2 (3711, BI.HF5c) were described previously (18Walter J. Grünberg J.

Antibody 5313 is raised to the ectodomain of βAPP (amino acids 444–592) and antibody 5818 is raised to the cytosolic domain of βAPP (amino acids 652–695). Mice carrying an ablatedPS2 gene were created by targeting exon 5 of the mouse gene in ES cells. A small deletion in exon 5 and insertion of the neomycin resistance gene was sufficient to disrupt translation. Northern blot analysis was carried out according to standard procedures. For Western blot analysis, brain extracts were prepared according to standard procedures. Brain extracts from PS2+/+, PS2+/−, and PS2−/− mice were analyzed for PS1, PS2, and βAPP expression using a combined immunoprecipitation/immunoblotting protocol (see below). To analyze expression of PS2, 293 cells were starved for 1 h in methionine- and serum-free minimum Eagle's medium and subsequently metabolically labeled with 700 μCi [35S]methionine (Promix; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in methionine- and serum-free minimum Eagle's medium for 30 min. The PS2 holoprotein was immunoprecipitated from cell extracts as described (17Steiner H. Romig H. Grim M.G. Philipp U. Pesold B. Citron M. Baumeister R. Haass C. J. Biol.

Following gel electrophoresis, immunoprecipitated PS proteins were identified by immunoblotting using the monoclonal antibody BI.3D7 (PS1; Ref. 20Steiner H. Capell A. Pesold B. Citron M.

Bound antibodies were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Stably transfected 293 cell lines were grown to confluence. For the analysis of Aβ in conditioned media, cells were metabolically labeled with 450 μCi [35S]methionine (Promix, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 2 h, and chased for 2 h in medium containing excess amounts of unlabeled methionine. Aβ and p3 were immunoprecipitated from conditioned media with antibody 3926 (21Wild-Bode C. Yamazaki T. Capell A. Leimer U. Steiner H. Ihara Y. Haass C. J. Biol.

To analyze βAPP-CTFs, cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with antibody C7 (22Podlisny M.B. Tolan D. Selkoe D.J. Am. J.

Quantitation of βAPP-CTFs, Aβ, and p3 was done by phosphoimager analysis. APPswas immunoprecipitated from conditioned media using antibody 5313. Conditioned media (2 ml) were collected from confluent 293 cells grown in 6-well dishes for 24 h. The media were assayed for Aβ40 and Aβ42 using a previously described enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (17Steiner H. Romig H. Grim M.G. Philipp U. Pesold B. Citron M. Baumeister R. Haass C. J. Biol.

Nature. 1998; 393: 382-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (1358) Google Scholar) were cloned into the pcDNA3.1/Hygro(+) expression vector (Invitrogen) and stably transfected into 293 cells. To analyze cleavage of Notch1, cells were starved for 1 h in methionine- and serum-free minimum Eagle's medium, subsequently metabolically labeled with 300 μCi [35S]methionine (Promix, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 20 min, and chased for 1 h in medium containing excess amounts of unlabeled methionine. Cell extracts were prepared and subjected to immunoprecipitation of Notch1 derivatives using the anti-Myc antibody 9E10 as described previously (23Schroeter E.H. Kisslinger J.A. Kopan R. Nature. 1998; 393: 382-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (1358) Google Scholar). Constructs for transgenic expression of PS2 and PS2 D366A in C. eleganswere generated as described previously (7Baumeister R. Leimer U. Zweckbronner I. Jakubek C. Grünberg J. Haass C. Genes Funct. 1997; 1: 149-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Transgenic lines were established by microinjection of plasmid DNA mixtures into the C. elegans germ line to create extrachromosomal arrays (7Baumeister R. Leimer U. Zweckbronner I. Jakubek C. Grünberg J. Haass C. Genes Funct. 1997; 1: 149-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Four independent lines from the progeny of F2 generation animals were established. As the sel-12(ar171) animals never lay eggs (7Baumeister R. Leimer U. Zweckbronner I. Jakubek C. Grünberg J. Haass C. Genes Funct. 1997; 1: 149-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar), rescue of the sel-12 defect can be quantified by scoring egg-laying behavior in transgenic animals (7Baumeister R. Leimer U. Zweckbronner I. Jakubek C. Grünberg J. Haass C. Genes Funct. 1997; 1: 149-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). 50 transgenic animals of each line were analyzed for their ability to lay eggs. The numbers of egg laid by individual transgenic animals were counted and placed into four categories.: Egl+++, robust egg laying, more than 30 eggs laid; Egl++, 15–30 eggs laid; Egl+, 5–15 eggs laid; Egl−, no eggs laid. To understand the function of PS2 we generated mice in which thePS2 gene is ablated. Northern and Western blot analysis confirmed the lack of PS2 expression (Fig.1, A and B). In contrast, no significant changes were observed in the levels of PS1 (Fig. 1 B). Surprisingly, in contrast to the very severe effects of the PS1 gene ablation on mouse embryonic development (3Shen J. Bronson R.T. Chen D.F. Xia W. Selkoe D.J. Tonegawa S. Cell. 1997; 89: 629-639Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (847) Google Scholar, 4Wong P.C. Zheng H. Chen H. Becher M.W. Sirinathsinghji D.J.S. Trumbauer M.E. Chen H.Y. Price D.L. Van der Ploeg L.H.T. Sisodia S.S. Nature. 1997; 387: 288-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar) the lack of the PS2 gene in mice does not result in an obvious phenotype. Gross external examination of neonates (Fig. 1 C) and adult null, heterozygote, and wt mice showed that the PS2-ablated mice develop normally up to the oldest age studied (1 year). Gross analysis of brain cytoarchitecture by Nissl stain (Fig.1, D–G) showed that ablated and wt mice have similar neuroanatomy. In addition, adult-ablated mice do not show gross skeletal abnormalities reminiscent of those seen in PS1 null mutant embryos (3Shen J. Bronson R.T. Chen D.F. Xia W. Selkoe D.J. Tonegawa S. Cell. 1997; 89: 629-639Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (847) Google Scholar, 4Wong P.C. Zheng H. Chen H. Becher M.W. Sirinathsinghji D.J.S. Trumbauer M.E. Chen H.Y. Price D.L. Van der Ploeg L.H.T. Sisodia S.S. Nature. 1997; 387: 288-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar) when examined by x-ray analysis (data not shown). Although it is possible that subtle cellular abnormalities exist in the PS2-ablated mice, it is clear that the PS2 null phenotype is grossly different from that seen in the PS1 null mouse (3Shen J. Bronson R.T. Chen D.F. Xia W. Selkoe D.J. Tonegawa S. Cell. 1997; 89: 629-639Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (847) Google Scholar, 4Wong P.C. Zheng H. Chen H. Becher M.W.

This suggests that PS2 is not obligatorily required for normal embryonic development. Moreover, in contrast to the PS1 deletion (1De Strooper B. Saftig P. Craessaerts K. Vanderstichele H. Guhde G. Annaert W. Von Figura K. Van Leuven F. Nature. 1998; 391: 387-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (1548) Google Scholar, 24Naruse S. Thinakaran G. Luo J.-J. Kusiak J.W. Tomita T. Iwatsubo T. Qian X. Ginty D.D.

Neuron. 1998; 21: 1213-1221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar), analysis of βAPP processing revealed no accumulation of APP CTFs (Fig. 1 B) and no change in Aβ production (data not shown) in the PS2−/− mice. However, the lack of a phenotype in the gene-ablated animals could be due to the compensation of PS2 activity by the significantly (5-fold) higher expression levels of PS1 during mouse development (25Lee K.L. Slunt H.H. Martin L.J. Thinakaran G. Kim G. Gandy S.E. Seeger M. Koo E. Price D.L. Sisodia S.S. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 7513-7525Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and might therefore not exclude an essential function of PS2. To allow a direct assessment of the functional role of PS2 in Aβ production and Notch signaling, we mutagenized a conserved aspartate residue (PS2 D366A) (15Levy-Lahad E. Wasco W. Poorkaj P.

As a control, cells were stably transfected with the wt PS2 cDNA. Overexpression of the mutation inhibits PS2 endoproteolysis, whereas the wt PS2 protein is proteolytically cleaved to generate the characteristic C-terminal fragments observed for presenilins (26Tomita T.

Analysis of Aβ/p3 generation revealed that cells stably expressing PS2 D366A secrete significantly less Aβ and p3 than cells overexpressing wt PS2 (Fig.2 B). The reduced Aβ and p3 production is not due to a decrease in protein secretion, because no difference in the secretion of APPs was found in the two cell lines (Fig.2 B). Quantitation demonstrates that Aβ/p3 production is inhibited by ∼90% as compared with wt PS2 expressing cells (Fig. 3,B and C).

To investigate if functional PS2 is required for cell fate decisions mediated by Notch signaling, we expressed PS2 D366A in a mutant strain of C. elegans, which lacks a functional PS homologue (sel-12 (ar171), Ref. 2Levitan D. Greenwald I. Nature. 1995; 377: 351-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar). The sel-12 (ar171) allele is known to cause a phenotype, which is due to reduced Notch signaling (2Levitan D.

However, expression of PS D366A failed to exhibit any rescuing activity (TableI).

Control cells or cells expressing the PS2 D366A mutation were stably transfected with the previously described NotchΔE cDNA (NΔE) construct (23Schroeter E.H. Kisslinger J.A. Kopan R. Nature. 1998; 393: 382-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (1358) Google Scholar). To monitor the generation of NICD from NΔE, we also generated cell lines expressing the NotchICV cDNA, which only encodes the derivative corresponding to NICD (23Schroeter E.H. Kisslinger J.A. Kopan R. Nature. 1998; 393: 382-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (1358) Google Scholar). In control cells, proteolytic release of NICD from NΔE was observed (Fig. 4). In agreement with previous results (23Schroeter E.H. Kisslinger J.A. Kopan R. Nature. 1998; 393: 382-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (1358) Google Scholar), the proteolytically released NICD co-migrates with the NotchICV-encoded protein (Fig. 4). In contrast, overexpression of the PS2 D366A mutation interferes with the proteolytic release of NICD (Fig. 4). Because this domain is required for Notch signaling (23Schroeter E.H. Kisslinger J.A. Kopan R. Nature. 1998; 393: 382-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (1358) Google Scholar, 31Struhl G. Adachi A.

In this work, we have demonstrated that mutagenesis of a highly conserved aspartate residue of PS2 results in a functionally inactive PS2 variant. This variant interferes with the proteolytic release of Aβ and NICD and is totally inactive in an in vivo assay monitoring Notch signaling. Ectopic expression of PS proteins is now well known to result in the efficient replacement of the endogenous presenilins (17Steiner H. Romig H. Grim M.G. Philipp U. Pesold B. Citron M. Baumeister R.

One might therefore argue that we simply followed the loss of PS1 function due to the displacement by the PS2 D366A mutation. However, consistent with previous data, overexpression of wt PS2 (Refs. 14Citron M. Westaway D. Xia W. Carlson G. Diehl T.S. Levesque G. Johnson-Wood K. Lee M. Seubert P. Davis A. Kholodenko D.

Therefore PS2 D366A is not only displacing PS1 but also appears to interfere directly with Aβ production and Notch cleavage. We can however not exclude that the effects observed by the overexpression of the PS2 D366A mutation are due to the inhibition of PS2 function (by the loss of function mutation) together with the inhibition of PS1 function (by replacement). To prove that PS2 is directly involved in Notch signaling we used an in vivo rescuing assay in C. elegans. In this system the PS homologue, the sel-12 gene, is nonfunctional, which leads to a prominent Notch phenotype. PS2 expression in the mutant worm leads to a full rescue (Table I) directly demonstrating PS2 activity in Notch signaling. In contrast, expressing PS2 D366A fails to exhibit any rescuing activity demonstrating that Asp-366 is critically required for PS2 function in Notch signaling. The very same mutation also blocks the proteolytic release of NICD and significantly reduces Aβ production. Based on these data, we conclude that PS2 promotes Aβ and NICD production by facilitating the endoproteolytic processing of their precursors. Therefore PS2 (data shown here) and PS1 functions (1De Strooper B. Saftig P. Craessaerts K. Vanderstichele H. Guhde G. Annaert W. Von Figura K. Van Leuven F.

Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6959-6963Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar) appear to be similar. This may also explain our finding that a PS2 ablation causes no obvious phenotype, because the highly expressed PS1 could take over PS2 function (25Lee K.L. Slunt H.H. Martin L.J. Thinakaran G. Kim G. Gandy S.E. Seeger M. Koo E. Price D.L. Sisodia S.S. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 7513-7525Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Based on these findings one would predict that a double knock-out of PS1 and PS2 would enhance the pathological phenotype. Moreover, reverse genetics in C. elegans revealed a redundant function of sel-12 and hop-1 in Notch signaling (32Song W. Nadeau P. Yuan M. Yang X. Shen J. Yankner B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6959-6963Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). A redundant function of PS1 and PS2 is also supported by the findings that wt PS2 can functionally replace sel-12in C. elegans like PS1 (Table I). However, further work is required to support these predictions. Based on the work reported here it may be interesting to prove if co-expression of nonfunctional PS1 and PS2 derivatives could increase the effects on proteolytic processing of βAPP. It may also be possible to rescue the reduced Aβ production in cells derived from PS1−/− mice by overexpression of PS2. We also want to note that additional functions of PS2, which may differ from PS1 cannot be excluded from our work. Indeed, PS2 may be functionally involved in apoptosis (34Wolozin B. Iwasaki K.

Grünberg J. Haass C. Proc. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1391-1396.Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). In that regard it is interesting to speculate that PS2 activity in apoptosis may also be required for intramembraneous processing of receptor proteins involved in signal transduction during programmed cell death. Whether the aspartate mutations inactivate an intrinsic aspartyl protease activity as suggested by Wolfe et al. (10Wolfe M.S. Xia W. Ostaszewski B.L. Diehl T.S. Kimberly W.T. Selkoe D.J. Nature. 1999; 398: 513-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (1685) Google Scholar) or indirectly affect cellular transport of certain target proteins (24Naruse S. Thinakaran G. Luo J.-J. Kusiak J.W. Tomita T.

However, based on our data not only PS1 but also PS2 may be a potential target for Aβ-lowering drugs. Because very minor amounts of the cytoplasmic Notch domain are required for signal transduction (23Schroeter E.H. Kisslinger J.A. Kopan R.

While this manuscript was in press, De Strooper and colleagues (36Herreman A. Hartmann D. Annaert W. Saftig P. Craessaerts K. Serneels L. Umans L. Schrijvers V. Checler F. Vanderstichele H.

https://openalex.org/W2050572437,"The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) is a ligand-activated transcription factor that dimerizes with the AHR nuclear translocator protein to mediate gene regulation. However, the AHR protein is rapidly depleted in vitro and in vivo following exposure to ligands. The purpose of the studies in this report was to characterize the mechanism of AHR degradation and determine the consequence of blocking the degradation process. Western blot and immunological analysis of rat smooth muscle (A7), murine Hepa-1, and human HepG2 cells show that ligand-induced degradation of AHR is blocked when the proteasome is inhibited by MG-132. AHR degradation is also blocked in Hepa-1 and HepG2 cells when nuclear export is inhibited with leptomycin B. Mutation of a putative nuclear export signal present in the AHR results in the accumulation of AHR in the nucleus and reduced levels of degradation following ligand exposure. In addition, inhibition of AHR degradation results in an increase in the concentration of AHR·AHR nuclear translocator complexes associated with DNA and extends the duration that the complex resides in the nucleus. These findings show that nuclear export and degradation of the AHR protein are two additional steps in the AHR-mediated signal transduction pathway and suggest novel areas for regulatory control."
https://openalex.org/W2031556612,"Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) signaling is dependent on the heterodimerization of the type II TGF-β receptor (TβRII) with the type I TGF-β receptor (TβRI). Activated TβRI then mediates TGF-β signals by inducing the phosphorylation of Smad2 and/or Smad3, which separately hetetorodimerize with Smad4 and translocate to the nucleus. Phosphorylation of Smad2/Smad3 by activated TβRI is inhibited by two newly discovered members of the Smad family, Smad6 and Smad7. We now report that Smad7 mRNA levels are increased in human pancreatic cancer by comparison with the normal pancreas, and that by in situ hybridization, Smad7 is over-expressed in the cancer cells within the tumor mass. Stable transfection of COLO-357 human pancreatic cancer cells with a full-length Smad7 construct leads to complete loss of the growth inhibitory response to TGF-β1, without altering TGF-β1-mediated induction of PAI-I. Furthermore, Smad7 transfected COLO-357 cells display enhanced anchorage-independent growth and accelerated growth in nude mice. These findings point to a previously unrecognized mechanism for selective suppression of TGF-β-mediated growth inhibition in cancer cells that allows for continued activation of the PAI-I promoter by TGF-β1, which may act to enhance the tumorigenicity of certain cancer cells."
https://openalex.org/W2107766793,"The Rho small G protein family members regulate various actin cytoskeleton-dependent cell functions. The Rho GDI (GDP dissociation inhibitor) family, consisting of Rho GDIalpha, -beta, and -gamma, is a regulator that keeps the Rho family members in the cytosol as the GDP-bound inactive form and translocates the GDP-bound form from the membranes to the cytosol after the GTP-bound form accomplishes their functions. Rho GDIalpha is ubiquitously expressed in mouse tissues and shows GDI activity on all the Rho family members in vitro. We have generated mice lacking Rho GDIalpha by homologous recombination to clarify its in vivo function. Rho GDIalpha -/- mice showed several abnormal phenotypes. Firstly, Rho GDIalpha -/- mice were initially viable but developed massive proteinuria mimicking nephrotic syndrome, leading to death due to renal failure within a year. Histologically, degeneration of tubular epithelial cells and dilatation of distal and collecting tubules were readily detected in the kidneys. Secondly, Rho GDIalpha -/- male mice were infertile and showed impaired spermatogenesis with vacuolar degeneration of seminiferous tubules in their testes. Thirdly, Rho GDIalpha -/- embryos derived from Rho GDIalpha -/- female mice were defective in the postimplantation development. In addition, these morphological and functional abnormalities showed age-dependent progression. These results suggest that the signaling pathways of the Rho family members regulated by Rho GDIalpha play important roles in maintaining the structure and physiological function of at least kidneys and reproductive systems in adult mice."

The PTB domain is present in a number of signaling molecules (9Pawson T.

This domain interacts with the NPXY motif of the juxtamembrane (JM) region of IR and promotes IR/IRS-1 interactions (11Wolf G. Trüb T. Ottinger E. Groninga L. Lynch A. White M.F. Miyazaki M. Lee J.

It contains multiple Tyr phosphorylation motifs that serve as docking sites for SH2 domain-containing proteins like the p85α regulatory subunit of PI3K, Grb2, Nck, Crk, Fyn, SHP-2, and others, which mediate the metabolic and growth-promoting functions of insulin (1Cheatham B.

The relative roles of the different IRS proteins in mediating insulin action are still unclear; however, studies of gene disruption revealed that IRS-2 compensates for the absence of IRS-1 in hepatocytes of IRS-1 null mice, while IRS-3 provides the major alternative pathway to PI3K activation in skeletal muscle and adipocytes of these animals (14Patti M.-E.

In contrast, IRS-2 null mice develop both insulin resistance and beta cell failure, which leads to their death (18Withers D.J. Gutierrez J.S. Towery H. Burks D.J. Ren J.M. Previs S. Zhang Y.

These data implicate different IRS proteins as mediators of insulin action in different tissues. IRS proteins contain over 30 potential Ser/Thr phosphorylation sites for kinases like protein kinase A, PKC, and mitogen-activated protein kinase (3Sun X.J. Rothenberg P. Kahn C.R. Backer J.M.

In previous studies, we have demonstrated that Ser/Thr phosphorylation of IRS-1 and IRS-2 significantly reduces their ability to interact with the JM region of IR. Such impaired interactions abolish the ability of IRS-1 and IRS-2 to undergo insulin-induced Tyr phosphorylation and further propagate insulin signaling, thus providing a possible molecular mechanism for the induction of an insulin-resistant state (20Paz K. Voliovitch H. Hadari Y.R. Roberts Jr., C.T. LeRoith D. Zick Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6998-7003Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 21Paz K. Hemi R. LeRoith R.

Ser/Thr phosphorylation of IRS proteins seems to be a key mechanism to regulate their function and raises several questions: which residues within IRS proteins undergo Ser phosphorylation, which are the kinases involved, and how such phosphorylations affect insulin signal transduction. The PTB domain of IRS proteins, which interacts with the JM region of IR, is a likely candidate to undergo Ser/Thr phosphorylation. Indeed, alignment of the PTB domains of IRS proteins reveals the presence of 16 conserved Ser/Thr residues, four in consensus PKB phosphorylation sites, that could be targets for different Ser/Thr kinases, including PKB. PKB (Akt), a Ser/Thr kinase, has been shown to function in the IR signaling cascade downstream of PI3K (22Alessi D.R. Andjelkovic M. Caudwell B. Cron P. Morrice N. Cohen P. Hemmings B.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6541-6551Crossref PubMed Scopus (2511) Google Scholar). PKB is activated by insulin in isolated adipocytes and plays a role in glucose metabolism (23Tanti J.F. Grillo S. Gremeaux T. Coffer P.J. Van Obberghen E. Le-Marchand Brustel Y. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 2005-2010Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, expression of a constitutively active PKB in 3T3-L1 cells or primary adipocytes stimulates glucose uptake and Glut4 translocation (23Tanti J.F. Grillo S. Gremeaux T. Coffer P.J. Van Obberghen E. Le-Marchand Brustel Y. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 2005-2010Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Kohn A.D. Summers S.A. Birnbaum M.J. Roth R.A. J. Biol.

Science. 1998; 279: 710-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (911) Google Scholar), but the detailed mechanism of this activation process is presently unknown. In the present study, we show that phosphorylation of Ser/Thr residues of IRS proteins has a dual function and serves either as a positive or as a negative modulator of insulin signal transduction. Our results implicate a wortmannin-sensitive Ser/Thr kinase, different from PKB, as the kinase that phosphorylates IRS-1 and acts as the negative feedback control regulator that turns off insulin signals by inducing the dissociation of IRS proteins from IR. In contrast, phosphorylation of Ser residues within the PTB domain of IRS-1 by insulin-stimulated PKB protects IRS proteins from the rapid action of protein Tyr phosphatases and enables the Ser-phosphorylated IRS proteins to maintain their Tyr-phosphorylated active conformation. These findings implicate PKB as a positive regulator of IRS-1 functions. Recombinant human insulin was a gift from Novo-Nordisc (Copenhagen, Denmark).

Confluent monolayers, grown in 60-mm dishes, were deprived of serum for 16 h prior to each experiment. The medium was aspirated, and the cells were incubated with the indicated inhibitors in serum-free medium for different time periods at 37 °C. Cells were then incubated with or without 100 nm insulin for 1 or 60 min at 37 °C. Cells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline and harvested in 300 μl (Fao cells) or 100 μl (CHO cells) of buffer A (25 mmTris-HCl, 2 mm sodium orthovanadate, 0.5 mmEGTA, 10 mm NaF, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 80 mm β-glycerophosphate, 25 mm NaCl, protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma), 1:1000, pH 7.4). Following three cycles of freezing and thawing, the cell extracts were centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C, and the supernatants were collected. Samples (100 μg) were resolved by means of SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with the indicated antibodies. Insulin receptors were purified from liver plasma membranes of 10-week old rats. The preparation of membranes, solubilization in Triton X-100, and immobilization of IR on wheat germ agglutinin-coupled beads were carried out as described previously (30Zick Y. Kasuga M. Kahn C.R.

Cells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline and harvested in 300 μl (Fao) or 100 μl (CHO-T) of buffer A. Following three cycles of freezing and thawing, the cell extracts were centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, and the supernatants were collected. Aliquots (300 μg) were incubated for 1 h with 30 μl of immobilized IR, with shaking, at 4 °C.

The constructs used to overexpress PKB were pCIS2-Akt-WT, pCIS2-Akt-K179A, or pCIS2-Akt-Myr (33Cong L.N. Chen H. Li Y. Zhou L. McGibbon M.A. Taylor S.I. Quon M.J. Mol.

Cells were solubilized at 4 °C in buffer B (25 mm Tris-HCl, 2 mm sodium orthovanadate, 0.5 mm EGTA, 10 mm NaF, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 80 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 25 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma), 1:1000, pH 7.4). Cells were centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, and the supernatants were collected. Aliquots (0.5–1.0 mg) were incubated for 3 h at 4 °C with polyclonal IRS-1 or PKB antibodies or monoclonal Myc antibodies coupled to 60 μl of protein A-Sepharose beads (50%) or goat anti-mouse-Sepharose beads (50%), respectively. Immunocomplexes were washed three times with buffer B and once with 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5. Immunocomplexes were resolved by means of SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with the indicated antibodies. Alternatively, the complexes served as a source for either the enzyme (PKB) or the substrate (IRS-1) in the in vitro kinase assays described bellow. Chromatographic fractionation were carried out at 4 °C using an Amersham Pharmacia Biotech Mono-Q FPLC system, as described previously (34Ahn N.G. Seger R. Bratlien R.L. Diltz C.D. Tonks N.K.

Fao cells from two confluent 15-cm plates were extracted in 1 ml of buffer A, disrupted on ice by 2 × 10 s sonication (30 watts), and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. Supernatants containing the cytosolic extracts were brought to a 10-ml volume with buffer C (50 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1.5 mm EGTA, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 0.1 mm sodium vanadate, pH 7.3) and were loaded at 0.5 ml/min on a Mono-Q column equilibrated with buffer C. Following a brief wash, 1-ml fractions were eluted at 1 ml/min with a 100-ml gradient from 0 to 0.4 m NaCl in buffer C. Fractions were stored at 4 °C, retaining activity for at least 3 weeks. Fao cells were treated for 20 min with a combination of 3 mm H2O2 and 1 mm sodium orthovanadate. Cell extracts were fractionated over Mono-Q FPLC (35Moule S.K. Welsh G.I. Edgell N.J. Foulstone E.J.

Fractions containing the activated PKB, identified using antibodies against phosphorylated PKB, were pooled, and 50-μl aliquots were used to phosphorylate the immunoprecipitated IRS-1. Phosphorylation in a final volume of 100 μl was initiated with 50 μl of a “reaction mix” to yield the following final concentrations: 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 50 μm[γ-32P]ATP, and 10 mm magnesium acetate. Reactions were allowed to proceed for different times at 22 °C and were terminated by adding 25 μl of 5× Laemmli sample buffer (57Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207002) Google Scholar). Samples were resolved by means of 7.5% SDS-PAGE and were subjected to autoradiography. We have previously shown that IRS-1 and IRS-2 selectively interact with immobilized peptides comprising the JM region of the IR (20Paz K. Voliovitch H. Hadari Y.R. Roberts Jr., C.T. LeRoith D.

Moreover, prolonged treatment of Fao cells with insulin or other Ser(P)/Thr(P)-elevating agents significantly reduced the ability of the IRS proteins to interact with the receptor and impaired their competence to undergo insulin-induced Tyr phosphorylation (21Paz K.

To determine the nature of the kinase(s) that catalyze this reaction, Fao or CHO-T cells were incubated with different kinase inhibitors prior to their incubation with insulin. Consistent with our previous findings (20Paz K. Voliovitch H. Hadari Y.R. Roberts Jr., C.T. LeRoith D. Zick Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6998-7003Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) incubation of CHO-T or Fao cells (Fig. 1, top) with 100 nm insulin rapidly stimulated Tyr phosphorylation of the IRS proteins. Phosphorylation was maximal 1 min following insulin treatment and then gradually declined over a 60-min incubation with the hormone. This was accompanied by a decrease in the electrophoretic mobility of the IRS proteins and an acute (>50%) reduction in their ability to interact in vitro with the IR (Fig. 1,bottom). Preincubation of the cells with wortmannin, a potent inhibitor of PI3K, eliminated both the mobility shift and the reduction in Tyr phosphorylation of IRS proteins observed following a 60-min treatment with insulin. In contrast, PD-98059, a specific mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase inhibitor (36Pang L. Sawada T. Decker S.J. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13585-13588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (895) Google Scholar), SB-202190, a specific inhibitor of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase, and the PKC inhibitors Go-6976 and GF-109203X had no such protective effect (Fig. 1, top). Furthermore, IRS-1, derived from wortmannin and insulin-treated cells, interacted with IR to a higher extent when compared with IRS-1 derived from cells that were incubated with insulin only for 60 min (Fig. 1,bottom). These findings suggest that IRS-1 serves as a substrate for an insulin-stimulated and wortmannin-sensitive Ser/Thr kinase, whose activity reduces the ability of IRS-1 to interact with the IR. Several studies have indicated that the PTB domain of IRS proteins interacts with an NPEY motif within the JM region of IR (11Wolf G. Trüb T. Ottinger E. Groninga L. Lynch A. White M.F. Miyazaki M.

Two additional Ser residues (Ser325 and Ser358 in mouse IRS-1) were found in a consensus PKB phosphorylation sequence within a conserved region of IRS-1 and IRS-2, named SAIN, located ∼50 amino acids C-terminal to the PTB domain (4Sun X.-J.

Since PKB is a wortmannin-sensitive Ser/Thr kinase present downstream of PI3K (22Alessi D.R. Andjelkovic M. Caudwell B. Cron P. Morrice N. Cohen P. Hemmings B.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6541-6551Crossref PubMed Scopus (2511) Google Scholar,38Burgering B.M. Coffer P.J. Nature. 1995; 376: 599-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (1878) Google Scholar), we wished to determine whether PKB might phosphorylate these Ser residues. For this purpose, the above mentioned Ser residues of IRS-1 (serines 265, 302, 325, 358) were mutated to Ala, and the wild-type IRS-1 as well as its mutated form (IRS-14A) were transiently overexpressed in CHO-T cells. Cell extracts were immunoprecipitated with IRS-1 antibodies, and equal amounts of the precipitated IRS-1 proteins were subjected to in vitrophosphorylation by an activated PKB, derived from Fao extracts, fractionated over Mono-Q FPLC. As shown in Fig.2 immunoprecipitated wild-type IRS-1 served as an in vitro substrate for the activated PKB and underwent phosphorylation in a time-dependent manner. Phosphorylation was markedly inhibited when IRS-14A was used as a substrate. These results suggest that Ser residues, located within the PTB/SAIN domain of IRS-1, are in vitrophosphorylation sites for PKB, that might regulate IRS-1 functionin vivo.Table I"

In this study, the topology and intracellular localization of 11β-HSD1 and 11β-HSD2 have been analyzed by immunohistochemistry and protease protection assays of in vitro transcription/translation products. 11β-HSD constructs, tagged with the FLAG epitope, were transiently expressed in HEK-293 cells. The enzymatic characteristics of tagged and native enzymes were indistinguishable. Fluorescence microscopy demonstrated the localization of both 11β-HSD1 and 11β-HSD2 exclusively to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane. To examine the orientation of tagged 11β-HSD enzymes within the ER membrane, we stained selectively permeabilized HEK-293 cells with anti-FLAG antibody. Immunohistochemistry revealed that the N terminus of 11β-HSD1 is cytoplasmic, and the catalytic domain containing the C terminus is protruding into the ER lumen. In contrast, the N terminus of 11β-HSD2 is lumenal, and the catalytic domain is facing the cytoplasm. Chimeric proteins where the N-terminal anchor sequences of 11β-HSD1 and 11β-HSD2 were exchanged adopted inverted orientation in the ER membrane. However, both chimeric proteins were not catalytically active. Furthermore, mutation of a tyrosine motif to alanine in the transmembrane segment of 11β-HSD1 significantly reducedVmax. The subcellular localization of 11β-HSD1 was not affected by mutations of the tyrosine motif or of a di-lysine motif in the N terminus. However, residue Lys5, but not Lys6, turned out to be critical for the topology of 11β-HSD1. Mutation of Lys5 to Ser inverted the orientation of 11β-HSD1 in the ER membrane without loss of catalytic activity. Our results emphasize the importance of the N-terminal transmembrane segments of 11β-HSD enzymes for their proper function and demonstrate that they are sufficient to determine their orientation in the ER membrane. 11β-Hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase enzymes (11β- HSD) regulate the ratio of active endogenous glucocorticoids to their inactive keto-metabolites, thereby controlling the access of glucocorticoids to their cognate receptors.

Although both 11β-HSD enzymes control the conversion of biologically active glucocorticoids (cortisol in humans and corticosterone in rats and mice) to their inactive 11-keto forms (cortisone and 11-dehydrocorticosterone), there are important functional differences such as cofactor specificity, substrate affinity, or direction of the reaction. 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase endoplasmic reticulum human embryonic kidney mineralocorticoid receptor polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis polymerase chain reaction Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium fluorescent isothiocyanate 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase endoplasmic reticulum human embryonic kidney mineralocorticoid receptor polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis polymerase chain reaction Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium fluorescent isothiocyanate The isoform 11β-HSD1 is expressed in a wide array of tissues, with highest levels in the liver, from where it was purified originally (2Lakshmi V.

Studies on the purified protein demonstrated glycosylation and existence of a disulfide bond, suggesting that the bulk of 11β-HSD1 is oriented to the ER lumen (9Ozols J. J. Biol.

By converting 11-keto- into 11β-hydroxyglucocorticoids, 11β-HSD1 plays an important role in the glucocorticosteroid receptor-mediated anti-inflammatory response of glucocorticoids (10Escher G.

To understand the differences in the physiological functions of 11β-HSD1 and 11β-HSD2, it is of great interest to know the exact topology and intracellular localization of these enzymes. Therefore, we evaluated the role of the N-terminal anchor sequences of 11β-HSD1 and 11β-HSD2 on their topology, intracellular localization, and catalytic activity. Our results demonstrate that the N-terminal sequences are critical for proper function of 11β-HSD enzymes and that they determine their orientation in the ER membrane. For cloning into and expression from the pcDNA3 plasmid (Invitrogen), the 5′ end of both the human 11β-HSD type 1 gene (35Tannin G.M. Agarwal A.K. Monder C. New M.I. White P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16653-16658Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the type 2 gene (18Albiston A.L. Obeyesekere V.R. Smith R.E. Krozowski Z.S. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1994; 105: R11-R17Crossref PubMed Scopus (731) Google Scholar) was modified first by the introduction of a BamHI site and second by changing the context 5′ to the initiator ATG codon to a “Kozak” consensus sequence (36Kozak M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 5073-5080Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). At the 3′ end, an XbaI site was introduced immediately 3′ of the stop codon. Thus, the 11β-HSD1 gene was modified to 5′ GAGGATCCGCCATGGCTTTT 3′ to 5′ AAGTAGGATCTAGATT 3′ and the 11β-HSD2 gene was changed to 5′ GAGGATCCGCCATGGAGCGC 3′ to 5′ GCTCGGTGAGCCATCTAGATT 3′ (restriction endonuclease sites, initiator, and stop codons are underlined). 11β-HSD1 was cloned by reverse transcriptase-PCR from total RNA isolated from primary culture cells of human aortic smooth muscle, a kind gift of Dr. K. Plüss (37Odermatt A. Taschner P.E.M. Scherer S.W. Beatty B. Khanna V.K. Cornblath D.R. Chaudhry V. Yee W.-C. Schrank B. Karpati G. Breuning M.H. Knoers N. MacLennan D.H.

Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (62898) Google Scholar). 11β-HSD2 was amplified by PCR from the original clone kindly provided by Dr. Z. S. Krozowski (see Ref. 18Albiston A.L. Obeyesekere V.R. Smith R.E. Krozowski Z.S. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1994; 105: R11-R17Crossref PubMed Scopus (731) Google Scholar). The clone used for expression of the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) was a generous gift of Dr. R. M. Evans (see Ref. 39Arriza J.L. Weinberger C. Cerelli G. Glaser T.M. Handelin B.L. Housman D.E. Evans R.M. Science. 1987; 237: 268-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (1624) Google Scholar). A sequence coding for the FLAG epitope (Sigma) was attached either to the N terminus (F1 and F2), creating the N-terminal sequence NH2-MDYKDDDD-M1, or to the C terminus (1F and 2F), creating the C-terminal sequence -MDYKDDDD-COOH. Attachment was through the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers with 5′-add-on sequences containing a restriction endonuclease site and a sequence coding the FLAG epitope. Chimeric constructs, where the N-terminal domain containing the transmembrane segment was exchanged, were obtained by PCR amplification. Sequences were exchanged at the beginning of the conserved Rossmann-fold motif (40Rossmann M.G. Liljas A. Bränden C.-I. Banaszak L.J. Enzymes. 1975; 11: 61-102Crossref Scopus (709) Google Scholar, 41Jörnvall H. Persson B. Krook M. Atrian S. Gonzalez-Duarte R. Jeffery J. Ghosh D. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 6003-6013Crossref PubMed Scopus (1148) Google Scholar) by introducing aPinAI restriction endonuclease site at the conserved threonine and glycine residues, not affecting the amino acid sequence (11β-HSD1, Thr40Gly41, ACCGGC to ACCGGT; 11β-HSD2: Thr88Gly89, ACAGGG to ACCGGT). The chimeric proteins were tagged with the FLAG epitope at the C terminus to allow facilitated detection. Constructs 1F and 2F were further subjected to site-directed mutagenesis using the Quick Change Mutagenesis kit from Stratagene. All constructs were verified by sequencing. HEK-293 cells, grown to a confluence of 70% in DMEM with 10% fetal calf serum, 4.5 g/liter glucose, 50 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin, 2 mm glutamine, were split 1:15 and transferred onto glass coverslips placed in six-well plates. In experiments where cells were cotransfected with 2F and MR, the molar ratio was 3:1, 1:1, or 1:3, respectively, with a total amount of 3 μg of DNA per well. The medium was replaced 14 h later, and cells were transfected with 2.5 μg of the corresponding DNA per well. Eight hours later, the medium was replaced to remove the Ca2+-phosphate precipitate. Immunostaining was performed 72 h post-transfection. The cells were fixed for 10 min at 25 °C using 3.7% paraformaldehyde in NAPS buffer (100 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, 120 mm sucrose), washed three times, and incubated for 30 min at 25 °C with NAPS buffer containing 1% milk powder and 0.5% Triton X-100. Incubation with monoclonal antibody M2 raised against the FLAG epitope (Sigma) was for 1 h at 25 °C. Glass coverslips were washed three times, followed by incubation with fluorescein-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Molecular Probes). After three wash steps, the cells were mounted using the Slow Fade Antifade kit (Molecular Probes). For selective permeabilization of the plasma membrane, Triton X-100 was replaced by digitonin at a concentration of 25 μm or by 0.05% saponin. Samples were analyzed on a LSM 400 confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss). Images were analyzed using NIH Image 1.60b7 software. To assess the percentage of stained cells in Triton X-100versus digitonin-permeabilized cells, fields of well spread cells were chosen by using the transmitted light, total cells were counted, and the number of fluorescent cells was determined under UV light. Data represent mean ± S.D. of at least five experiments from independent transfections. HEK-293 cells were transfected according to the calcium phosphate precipitation method (42Kingston R.E. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1992: 9.1.1-9.1.4Google Scholar). The medium was replaced by charcoal-treated DMEM 48 h later, and cells were harvested 72 h post-transfection. The cells were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline and centrifuged. The cell pellet was subjected to a freeze/thaw cycle and resuspended in TG1 buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4; 100 mm NaCl; 1 mm EGTA; 1 mm EDTA; 1 mmMgCl2; 20% glycerol), and activity assays were started immediately. Oxidative activity of 11β-HSD enzymes was measured by determining the rate of conversion of corticosterone to 11-dehydrocorticosterone in the presence of NADP+ to analyze 11β-HSD1 derivatives, or NAD+, for 11β-HSD2 derivatives. The reaction was started by mixing cell extract corresponding to 2–10 μg of total proteins with 10 μl of reaction mixture. The assay was performed in a final volume of 20 μl containing 400 μm NADP+, 30 nCi of [3H]corticosterone, and corticosterone at different concentrations ranging from 25 nm to 2 μm. Samples were incubated for 10–30 min at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped by adding methanol and an excess of unlabeled steroids. Corticosterone and 11β-dehydrocorticosterone were separated by thin layer chromatography and analyzed as described (10Escher G. Galli I. Vishwanath S. Frey B.M. Frey F.J. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 189-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). In measurements using whole cells, TG1 buffer was replaced by charcoal-treated DMEM. The cells were washed and resuspended in prewarmed (37 °C) charcoal-treated DMEM. No cofactor was added for the whole cell assay. When measuring reductive activity of 11β-HSD enzymes, NADPH (only in assays using extracts), [3H]11β-dehydrocorticosterone, and dehydrocorticosterone were used. Enzyme kinetics were analyzed by the Eadie-Hofstee linear transformation of the Michaelis-Menten equation. Kmand Vmax values, calculated using the Lineweaver-Burk plot, were in line with the values obtained from the Eadie-Hofstee transformation. Constants were calculated by unweighted linear regression analysis with mean values of at least three experiments from independent transfections. Only conversion rates between 10 and 75% have been considered for calculation. Significance was tested by Student's unpaired t test. To compare the expression level of the different constructs, cells were extracted with 0.5% Triton X-100 for 15 min on ice, centrifuged to remove debris, and an amount of 50 μg of total proteins was separated by 12.5% SDS-PAGE. Proteins were transferred electrophoretically to nitrocellulose and incubated with the monoclonal antibody M2 raised against the FLAG epitope (Sigma). Antibody binding was visualized using the ECL Western detection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The data were analyzed by scanning densitometry using NIH Image 1.60b7 software. The pcDNA3 plasmids carrying the relevant constructs were subjected to in vitro transcription by T7 RNA polymerase and translation in reticulocyte lysate in the presence of dog pancreas microsomes (TNT Quick system, Promega). In a typical assay, 500 ng of linearized plasmid DNA, 20 μCi of [35S]methionine (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and 3 μl of canine pancreatic microsomal membranes (Promega) were incubated for 60 min at 30 °C in a final volume of 25 μl. The reaction was chilled on ice, followed by addition of 10 mmTris-CaCl2, pH 8.0. Translocation of polypeptides to the lumenal side of the microsomes was assayed by proteinase K treatment. An aliquot of 8 μl from the in vitrotranscription/translation product was incubated for 30 min on ice with 0.2 mg/ml proteinase K (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) in the presence or absence of 0.5% Triton X-100. Proteinase K was inactivated by the addition of 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and subsequent boiling for 5 min. Proteins were subjected to 12.5% SDS-PAGE and analyzed by autoradiography and scanning. Data were analyzed using the NIH Image software (version 1.60b7). In order to investigate the intracellular localization of 11β-HSD enzymes and to analyze whether 11β-HSD2 is also expressed in the nucleus, we extended earlier studies (9Ozols J. J. Biol.

Immunostaining using monoclonal antibody M2 specific for the FLAG epitope and FITC-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG revealed a pattern typical for localization to the ER membrane for both 11β-HSD1 (1F) and 11β-HSD2 (2F) (Fig. 1.). There was no indication of nuclear staining or staining at the plasma membrane. Cells were analyzed by confocal laser scanning microscopy 72 h post-transfection. There was no difference in the expression pattern when cells were stained 96 or 120 h post-transfection (data not shown). Densitometric analysis of over 100 transfected cells revealed that the fluorescent light from the area inside the nucleus was only 2.0 ± 1.5% that of the light detected from the area containing the ER. A similar level of background staining was obtained in previous experiments using the same technique with the sarcoendoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA1) and sarcolipin, two proteins known to be expressed exclusively in the ER membrane, with nuclear signals ranging from 1 to 3% (43Odermatt A.

Furthermore, coexpression of 11β-HSD2 and mineralocorticoid receptor in the presence of 5 nm aldosterone or 25 nm cortisol did not result in an increase of nuclear signal, with 1.8 ± 1.4 and 2.0 ± 1.6% of the signal detected from the area containing the ER, respectively (data not shown). To determine the topology of 11β-HSD enzymes, we immunostained cells expressing constructs with a FLAG epitope attached either to the N terminus (F1 and F2) or to the C terminus (1F and 2F). Expression was detected using anti-FLAG antibody (M2) and FITC-labeled secondary antibody. Approximately 32% of total cells were stained after complete permeabilization of cells using 0.5% Triton X-100 (Fig.2, A and C). The transfection efficiency was 32 ± 2% (TableI). About the same number of fluorescent cells expressing constructs F1 (not shown) or 2F (Fig. 2 D) were detected with anti-FLAG antibody after treatment with 25 μm digitonin to permeabilize the plasma membrane selectively, leaving the ER membrane intact. Under these conditions anti-FLAG antibody was unable to interact with the FLAG epitope attached to the C terminus of 11β-HSD1 (1F, see Fig. 2 B) or to the N terminus of 11β-HSD2 (F2, not shown), suggesting lumenal orientation of the FLAG epitope in 1F and F2 (Table I). Selective permeabilization of the plasma membrane was achieved at digitonin concentrations between 10 and 75 μm (43Odermatt A. Becker S. Khanna V.K. Kurzydlowski K. Leisner E. Pette D. MacLennan D.H.

Similar results were obtained in experiments where the plasma membrane was selectively permeabilized with 0.05% saponin (data not shown). These results strongly suggest that the N-terminal sequence of 11β-HSD1 faces the cytoplasm and the C-terminal part protrudes into the lumen of the ER. In contrast, the N terminus of 11β-HSD2 is directed toward the lumenal compartment and the C terminus containing the catalytic moiety is facing the cytoplasm.Table ITopology of 11β-HSD enzymes and chimeric constructsDescriptionNamePermeabilization conditionsTriton X-100Digitonin11β-HSD1, C-terminal FLAG1F29 ± 22 ± 111β-HSD1, N-terminal FLAGF130 ± 228 ± 411β-HSD2, C-terminal FLAG2F35 ± 332 ± 211β-HSD2, N-terminal FLAGF233 ± 21 ± 1N-terminal 11β-HSD2, catalytic domain 11β-HSD1, C-terminal FLAG21F35 ± 432 ± 3N-terminal 11β-HSD1, catalytic domain 11β-HSD2, C-terminal FLAG12F33 ± 32 ± 1Transfected HEK-293 cells were either completely permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100, or the plasma membrane was selectively permeabilized with 25 μm digitonin, allowing restricted access of the antibody to the cytosolic compartment.

https://openalex.org/W2067450274,"Heparin-binding epidermal-like growth factor (HB-EGF) is synthesized as a transmembrane precursor (HB-EGFTM). The addition of phorbol ester (PMA, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate) to cells expressing HB-EGFTM results in the metalloproteinase-dependent release (shedding) of soluble HB-EGF. To analyze mechanisms that regulate HB-EGF shedding, a stable cell line was established expressing HB-EGFTM in which the ectodomain and the cytoplasmic tail were tagged with hemagglutinin (HA) and Myc epitopes, respectively (HB-EGFTMHA/Myc). HB-EGFTMHA/Myc cleavage was followed by the appearance of soluble HB-EGFHA in conditioned medium, the loss of biotinylated cell-surface HB-EGFTMHA/Myc, and the appearance of a Myc-tagged cytoplasmic tail fragment in cell lysates. By using this approach, several novel metalloproteinase-dependent regulators of HB-EGFTM shedding were identified as follows. (i) HB-EGFTMHA/Myc shedding induced by PMA was blocked by the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase kinase inhibitor, PD98059. PMA activated MAP kinase within 5 min, but HB-EGFTMHA/Myc shedding did not occur until 20 min, suggesting that MAP kinase activation was a necessary step in the pathway of PMA-induced HB-EGFTM cleavage. (ii) Activation of an inducible Raf-1 kinase, ΔRaf-1:estrogen receptor, resulted in a rapid MAP kinase activation within 10 min and shedding of HB-EGFTMHA/Myc within 20–40 min. (iii) Serum induced MAP kinase activation and HB-EGFTMHA/Myc shedding that were inhibited by PD98059. (iv) Whereas PMA induced HB-EGFTMHA/Myc shedding in attached cells, no shedding occurred when the cells were placed in suspension. Shedding was fully restored shortly after cells were allowed to spread on fibronectin, and the extent of PMA-induced shedding increased with the extent of cell spreading. PMA induced the same level of MAP kinase activation whether the cells were attached or in suspension suggesting that although MAP kinase activation might be necessary for shedding, it was not sufficient. Taken together, these results suggest that there are two components of cell regulation that contribute to the shedding process, not previously recognized, the Raf-1/MAP kinase signal transduction pathway and cell adhesion and spreading.

The extracellular domains of many membrane-anchored proteins are proteolytically cleaved from the cell surface in a process termed as shedding. Shedding is an irreversible post-translational modification that regulates biological function by releasing growth factors, enzymes, and soluble receptors (1Bosenberg M.W. Massague J. Curr. Opin.

PMA treatment of cells results in metalloproteinase-dependent proteolytic cleavage of cell-surface-anchored precursors such as TGF-α, β-APP (6Arribas J. Massague J. J.

The PMA-induced shedding of TGF-α has been well characterized (8Pandiella A. Massague J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5769-5773Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It has been suggested that all the components required for TGF-α shedding are located at or close to the cell surface (9Bosenberg M.W. Pandiella A. Massague J. J.

There may be a common mechanism for PMA-induced shedding since a mutant CHO cell line isolated for its inability to cleave TGF-α was unable to cleave β-APP and a variety of other cell-surface molecules in response to PMA (6Arribas J.

Mature soluble HB-EGF is a potent stimulator of cell proliferation and migration, for example of smooth muscle cells (SMC), fibroblasts, and keratinocytes (39Raab G. Klagsbrun M. Biochem. Biophys.

Since the conversion of HB-EGFTM to mature soluble HB-EGF has possible physiological and pathological implications, we have further analyzed mechanisms of PMA-induced shedding. In this report we identify several previously unrecognized regulators of HB-EGFTM shedding. These are the Raf-1/MAP kinase cascade and cell adhesion and spreading. All cell culture reagents were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. Anti-phospho-ERK1/2 antibodies and PD98059 were purchased from Calbiochem.

Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG, and CompleteTMmixture of protease inhibitors were purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG was purchased from Promega (Madison, WI). The hydroxamic acid-based metalloproteinase inhibitor, BB3489, was kindly provided by British Biotech (Oxford, UK). Chinese hamster ovary (CHO-K1) cells were purchased from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA) and maintained in α-minimal essential medium (α-MEM) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 1% glutamine, 1% penicillin and streptomycin, in 5% CO2. CHO-HB-EGFTMHA/Myc cells were grown to 90–95% confluence in 10-cm dishes (1.8 × 106 cells/dish). HB-EGFTMHA/Myc was constructed so that the hemagglutinin (HA) epitope was inserted in the N-terminal extracellular domain between amino acids Leu83 and Thr85, and the Myc epitope was placed at the C terminus (Fig. 1 A). The doubled-tagged construct was prepared as follows. First HB-EGFTM/myc was prepared by polymerase chain reaction amplification of the complete open reading frame of HB-EGF cDNA (33Higashiyama S. Abraham J.A. Miller J. Fiddes J.C. Klagsbrun M. Science. 1991; 251: 936-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (1042) Google Scholar) using synthetic DNA oligonucleotide primers: a forward primer, 5′-GCTCTAGAGCATGAAGCTGCTGCCGTCG-3′ corresponding to the 5′ end of the full-length HB-EGF open reading frame, and a reverse primer, 5′-GCTCACAGATCCTCTTCTGAGATGAGTTTTTGTTCGTGGGAATTAGTCATGCC-3′, complementary to the nucleotide sequence of a Myc tag followed by the 3′ end of the full-length HB-EGF. The polymerase chain reaction product was ligated into a pCR3.1 mammalian expression vector using the TA cloning kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). HB-EGFTM ha/myc was prepared using two complementary oligonucleotides 3′-CCTACCCATACGACGTCCCAGACTACG-5′ and 5′-CGTAGTCGTGGACGTCGTATGGGTAGG-3′ encoding the HA epitope flanked by an MscI site. The oligonucleotides were synthesized and annealed to each other and then inserted into a uniqueMscI site in HB-EGFTM (between amino acids Leu83 and Thr85). The correct sequence of HB-EGFTM ha/myc was confirmed by DNA sequence analysis. For expression, the HB-EGFTM ha/mycinsert was excised from the pCR3.1 vector after an EcoRI digest and subcloned into the EcoRI site of the pIRES/neo mammalian expression vector (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA). The resulting plasmid pIRES/neo-HB-EGFTM ha/myc was transfected into CHO-K1 cells using LipofectAMINE and opti-MEM transfection medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Twenty four hours post-transfection, cells were passaged 1:25 and plated on 10-cm tissue culture dishes. They were grown in α-MEM supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, and 1 mg/ml G418 in 5% CO2. After 12 days stable clones were selected, expanded, and conditioned media (CM) were collected and tested for the presence of HA-tagged soluble HB-EGF ectodomain by Western blotting with anti-HA antibodies. Five independent clones that overexpressed HB-EGFTMHA/Myc were expanded and characterized. CHO-HB-EGFTMHA/Myc cells were grown overnight to approximately 65% confluence in 10-cm dishes. They were transfected transiently using LipofectAMINE as above with ΔRaf-1:ER plasmid DNA (16 μg/10-cm dish) alone (provided by Dr. Martin McMahon, University of California, San Francisco/Mt. Zion Cancer Center, San Francisco) (45Samuels M.L. Weber M.J. Bishop J.M. McMahon M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6241-6252Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar) or co-transfected with HA-ERK1 cDNA (provided by Dr. John Blenis, Harvard Medical School) (46Meloche S. Pages G. Pouyssegur J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 63-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) and ΔRaf-1:ER cDNA. In co-transfection experiments, the ratio of ΔRaf-1:ER cDNA to HA-ERK1 cDNA was 10-fold. The total amount of cDNA did not exceed 16 μg/10-cm dish. CHO-HB-EGFTMHA/Myc analysis was carried out 22–24 h post-transfection. For stable expression, the ΔRaf-1:ER cDNA construct was transfected into CHO-HB-EGFTMHA/Myc cells as above. Twenty-four hours post-transfection, cells were passaged 1:25 and plated on 10-cm tissue culture dishes. Cells were grown in α-MEM supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, 0.5 mg/ml G418, and 5 μg/ml puromycin (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) in 5% CO2. After 9 days stable clones were selected, expanded, and assayed for activation of MAP kinase in response to tamoxifen. Five independent clones were chosen for further studies. Cells were washed twice with 20 mm Hepes buffer, pH 7.2, 150 mm NaCl (HBS), and incubated on ice with EZ-link-NHS-sulfo-biotin (Pierce, 0.1 mg/ml) in HBS, for 10 min in order to minimize the internalization of cell-surface HB-EGFTM. After aspiration, the cells were washed twice with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 150 mm NaCl to quench the biotinylation reaction. The cells were washed with HBS, and serum-free α-MEM supplemented with 0.05% BSA (5 ml/plate) was added to cells prior to use. Cells from a 10-cm dish were harvested by scraping into 1 ml of phospho-homogenization buffer that contained 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.2, 50 mm NaCl, 250 mm sucrose, 2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mmsodium orthovanadate, 10 mm NaF, 5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, and a mixture of protease inhibitors (SPH buffer), and then homogenized by passing six times through a 26.5-gauge needle. The nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation at 400 × g. Fractions containing HB-EGFTMHA/Myc were obtained by centrifugation of the post-nuclear supernatants at 15,800 ×g (P2). HB-EGFTMHA/Myc was solubilized by resuspending the P2 pellets in SPH buffer supplemented with Triton X-100 (1% final concentration) and incubating on ice for 10 min. The Triton X-100-insoluble material was pelleted by brief centrifugation at 15,800 × g. Biotinylation studies have shown that virtually all cell-surface HB-EGFTMHA/Myc is contained in P2. Cells grown overnight were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and then detached by incubation with PBS supplemented with 5 mm EDTA for 5 min at 37 °C, 5% CO2. Cells were washed with Hepes-buffered serum-free α-MEM supplemented with 0.1% BSA and resuspended in serum-free medium containing 0.1% BSA. Cells were either maintained in suspension for 30 min or re-plated after 30 min on bacterial dishes precoated with fibronectin at various densities (0–2500 cm2), as described previously (47Ingber D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 3579-3583Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). Proteins were resolved on 10 or 15% SDS-PAGE for MAP kinase/ERK or HB-EGF detection, respectively. Proteins were electroblotted for 1.5 h onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Bio-Rad) in 40 mm CAPS buffer, pH 10.5, in 15% methanol. A constant 24 V was applied. For detection of HB-EGFTMHA/Myc and HB-EGFHA, the membranes were blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin in PBS, 0.25% Tween 20 (PBST). The blots were first incubated with anti-HA or anti-Myc monoclonal antibodies (1:5000) and then with anti-mouse IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (1:5000). For detection of phospho-ERK and total ERKs in the blotting, Tris-buffered saline was substituted for PBS. The blots were incubated with anti-phospho-ERK or anti-ERK1/2 antibodies in (1:2000), followed by anti-rabbit or anti-goat IgG, respectively, conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (1:5000). To detect cell-surface biotinylation after immunoprecipitation with anti-HA, biotinylated proteins were detected using horseradish peroxidase-coupled streptavidin (1:5000). The blots were developed using an enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (NEN Life Science Products). Cells from a 10-cm dish were scraped into 1 ml of SPH buffer. Triton X-100 was added to 1% final concentration, and the cells were lysed for 20 min on ice. The insoluble material was pelleted by centrifugation at 14,000 ×g at 4 °C for 10 min. Supernatants were precleared by incubation with 40 μl of protein G-Sepharose (50% v/v slurry), for 1 h at 4 °C and incubated overnight with 0.2 μg of the appropriate antibody. The immune complexes were collected by incubating the samples with 40 μl of protein G-Sepharose (50% v/v slurry) for 1.5 h at 4 °C, washed four times with lysis buffer, and boiled in 2× Laemmli's sample buffer. The extent of the PMA-induced HB-EGFTMHA/Myc cleavage and MAP kinase activation was quantified by densitometric scanning of films obtained after ECL using a UMAX PowerLookII scanner and the NIH Image program. The extent of cleavage was calculated by dividing the amount of the intact HB-EGFTMHA/Myc prior to PMA treatment by the amount of intact HB-EGFTMHA/Myc after PMA treatment and corrected for loading. The extent of HB-EGFTM cleavage and MAP kinase activation is expressed in arbitrary units. Cells were transferred a"

https://openalex.org/W2090563156,"Cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (cdkis), such as p21, are believed to control proliferation through an ability to function as stoichiometric antagonists of cyclin-dependent kinases (cdks). The p21 gene is a direct transcriptional target for the p53 protein, and its activation is likely to be important in effecting the p53 response. It is widely accepted that p21 can influence cell cycle progression by controlling the activity of cdks that act on the retinoblastoma tumour suppressor protein (pRb) which, in a hypophosphorylated state, associates with E2F transcription factors to prevent the activation of genes required for progression into S phase. Phosphorylation of pRb by G1 cdk complexes releases E2F and thereby enables progress through the cell cycle. Here, we describe results which suggest a p21-dependent mechanism that facilitates the regulation of E2F through a pathway that is independent of the cdk control of pRb activity. As p21 can associate with E2F subunits, it is possible that these effects are exerted through a complex with E2F. Furthermore, we find that p21 can regulate transcription in vitro. The results suggest that p21 may control E2F activity through a pathway that acts independently of pRb."

Resolution of the structure of CCR5, either alone or in a complex with HIV-1 gp120, would provide information important for guiding attempts at intervention. The GPCRs play central roles in a wide variety of physiological, neurological, and immunological processes and represent major targets for current pharmaceutical therapies (26Stadel J.M. Wilson S. Bergsma D.J. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1997; 18: 430-437Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 27Helmreich E.J.M. Hofmann K.P. Biochim. Biophys.

Nonetheless, structural information on this large family of proteins is very sparse. Generally low levels of expression and the dependence of the native conformation of these proteins on the hydrophobic, intramembrane environment have complicated attempts to study GPCR structure. With the exception of the light-sensitive opsins found in certain bacteria and in the retinae of higher organisms, most GPCRs are naturally expressed at low levels (29Lanyi J.K. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1999; 187: 161-202Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,30Khorana H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1-4Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). No system has reproducibly resulted in levels of protein expression suitable for the purification of most GPCRs (31Stanasila L. Pattus F. Massotte D. Biochimie. 1998; 80: 563-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Bacterial, yeast, or insect cell expression of GPCRs can result in protein misfolding, aggregation, and heterogeneity (32Tate C.G. Grisshammer R. Trends Biotechnol. 1996; 14: 426-430Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Furthermore, some GPCRs, such as CCR5, require posttranslational modification, which may exhibit significant differences in nonmammalian cell types, for efficient function (33Farzan M. Mirzabekov T. Kolchinsky P. Wyatt R. Cayabyab M. Gerard N. Gerard G. Sodroski J. Choe H. Cell. 1999; 96: 667-676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar). Irreversible protein denaturation occurring during the solubilization of the cell membrane, a process required for purification of the GPCR, represents another obstacle to biochemical, biophysical, and structural studies. Here, we report the development of a system for efficient expression of CCR5, and the identification of an approach that allows solubilization and purification of CCR5 in its native state. We demonstrate a cell-free association between CCR5 and the HIV-1 gp120 glycoprotein. These methods should facilitate the identification of small molecules that block the HIV-1-CCR5 association, the determination of CCR5 structure, and the study of other GPCRs. The analysis of codon usage for 45 GPCRs representing different protein subfamilies was performed with GenBankTMdata and software developed by the University of Wisconsin Genome Sequence Group. The sequence encoding human CCR5 was optimized for mammalian cell codon usage (28Bikker J.A. Trumpp-Kallmeyer S. Humblet C. J. Med. Chem. 1998; 41: 2911-2927Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), utilizing the following codons: alanine (GCC), arginine (CGC), asparagine (AAC), aspartic acid (GAC), cysteine (TGC), glutamic acid (GAG), glutamine (CAG), glycine (GGC), histidine (CAC), isoleucine (ATC), leucine (CTG), lysine (AAG), methionine (ATG), phenylalanine (TTC), proline (CCC), serine (TCC), threonine (ACC), tryptophan (TGG), tyrosine (TAC), and valine (GTG). The 5′ and 3′ sequences flanking the CCR5 coding sequence were modified. Following restriction sites for EcoRV,EcoRI and HindIII, the Kozak consensus (GCCGCCACCATGG) was placed immediately 5′ to the CCR5 reading frame. A sequence encoding a single glycine residue followed by the bovine rhodopsin C9 peptide tag (TETSQVAPA) was introduced immediately 5′ to the natural stop codon of CCR5. At the 3′ end of the epitope-tagged CCR5 gene, XbaI, SalI, andNotI restriction sites were introduced. Analogous constructs were made for the wild-type human CCR5 gene and the bovine rhodopsin gene, except that the codons were not altered and, in the latter case, the C-terminal C9 sequence was naturally present. A total of 34 oligonucleotides, each approximately 70 nucleotides in length, corresponding to the complete sense and antisense strands of the synCCR5 gene and flanking sequences, were constructed so that approximately 50% of their sequences were complementary to those of each of the two complementary oligonucleotides from the opposite strand. Oligonucleotides were deprotected in pure ammonium hydroxide at 65 °C for 4 h, after which the ammonium hydroxide was evaporated, and the oligonucleotides were dissolved in water at a final concentration of 2 nm. For gene synthesis, the 34 oligonucleotides were separated into five groups (6 or 8 oligonucleotides per group) and 25 cycles of polymerase chain reaction were performed using Pfu polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and a 3-fold molar excess of the 5′ and 3′ terminal oligonucleotides in each group. This step generated five small segments of the synCCR5 gene with complementary and overlapping ends. Equal amounts of each polymerase chain reaction product were combined with a 3-fold molar excess of the 5′ and 3′ terminal oligonucleotides of the complete synCCR5 sequence. A second round of 25 cycles of polymerase chain reaction yielded the complete synCCR5 sequence. The product was sequenced to ensure that the sequence was correct. The synCCR5, wild-type CCR5, and bovine rhodopsin sequences were cloned into the following vectors: PMT4 (a gift from Dr. Reeves, Massachusetts Institute of Technology), PACH (a gift from Dr. Velan, Israel Institute for Biological Research), pcDNA 3.1(+) and pcDNA4/HisMax (Invitrogen), and PND (a gift from Dr. Rhodes, University of California, Davis). After cloning of the synCCR5 gene into the pcDNA4/HisMax vector, the sequence encoding the N-terminal HisMax region was removed by QuikChange mutagenesis (Stratagene). Different cell lines were transfected with the synCCR5 and wild-type CCR5 genes using the GenePorter transfection reagent (San Diego, CA). Following transfection, cells expressing CCR5 were selected with 0.8 mg/ml of neomycin (G418). Cells expressing the highest surface levels of CCR5 were selected by FACS after staining cells with the R-phycoerythrin-conjugated anti-CCR5 antibody 2D7-PE (Pharmingen, San Diego, CA). Among all tested cells (canine thymocytes Cf2Th, human embryonic kidney cells HEK-293T, COS-1, and HeLa (American Type Culture Collection)), the highest CCR5 expression levels were observed in Cf2Th and HEK-293T cells transfected with synCCR5 gene in the PACH vector. The highest synCCR5-expressing clones were selected by FACS from a total of 76 clones of Cf2Th cells and 62 clones of HEK-293T cells. Approximately 4 × 106 CCR5-expressing Cf2Th or HEK-293T cells grown to full confluency in 100-mm dishes were washed twice in PBS and starved for 1 h at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without cysteine and methionine (Sigma) or in sulfate-free media (ICN, Costa Mesa, CA). The starvation medium was removed and 200 μCi each of [35S]methionine and [35S]cysteine or 500 μCi of [35S]sulfate (NEN Life Science Products) in 4 ml of medium was added to the cells for various times for pulse-chase experiments or overnight (12 h) in all other cases. Cells were washed twice with PBS and lysed in 1 ml of solubilization medium composed of 100 mm(NH4)2SO4, 20 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10% glycerol, 1% (w/v) detergent (see below), and Protease Inhibitor Mixture (one tablet of Complete™ (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) per 25 ml). The lysate was incubated at 4 °C for 30 min on a rocking platform, and cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 30 min. CCR5 was precipitated with 20 μl of 1D4-Sepharose beads (38Reeves P. Thurmond R.L. Khorana G.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 94: 7784-7790Google Scholar) overnight, after which the beads were washed six times in the solubilization medium and pelleted. An equal volume of 2× SDS-sample buffer was added to the beads, following by resuspension and incubation for 1 h at 55 °C. Samples were run on 11% SDS-polyacrylamide minigels, which were visualized by autoradiography or analyzed on a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager SI (Sunnyvale, CA). A total of 18 detergents were tested in the solubilization buffers. The detergents, with abbreviations and critical micelle concentrations in parentheses, weren-octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside (23.4 mm), n-decyl-β-d-maltoside (1.8 mm), n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside (DDM) (0.17 mm), cyclohexyl-butyl-β-d-maltoside (CymalTM-4, 7.6 mm), cyclohexyl-pentyl-β-d-maltoside (CymalTM-5, 2.4 mm), cyclohexyl-hexyl-β-d-maltoside (CymalTM-6, 0.56 mm), cyclohexyl-heptyl-β-d-maltoside (CymalTM-7, 0.19 mm), cyclo-hexylpropanoyl-N-hydroxyethylglucamide (108 mm), cyclohexylbutanoyl-N-hydroxyethylglucamide (35 mm), cyclohexylpentanoyl-N-hydroxyethylglucamide (11.5 mm), N-octylphosphocholine (Fos-CholineTM 8, 114 mm),N-decylphosphocholine (Fos-CholineTM 10, 11 mm), N-dodecylphosphocholine (Fos-CholineTM 12, 1.5 mm),N-tetradecylphosphocholine (Fos-CholineTM 14, 0.12 mm), Triton X-100 (0.02 mm), CHAPS (8 mm), Nonidet P-40 (0.02 mm), and diheptanoyl-phosphocholine (DHPC) (1.4 mm). All detergents were purchased from Anatrace (Maumee, OH) except DHPC, which was purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL). Stable Cf2Th/PACH/synCCR5 cells grown to full confluency in a 150-mm dish were incubated with medium containing 4 mm sodium butyrate for 40 h, washed in PBS, detached by treatment with 5 mm EDTA/PBS, pelleted, and again washed in PBS. Cells were solubilized for 30 min with 3 ml of the solubilization medium containing CymalTM-5 and centrifuged for 30 min at 14,000 × g. The cell lysate was incubated with 50 μl of 1D4-Sepharose beads on a rocking platform at 4 °C for 10–12 h. The Sepharose beads were washed five times with the washing buffer (100 mm(NH4)2SO4, 20 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10% glycerol, and 1% CymalTM-5) and once with washing buffer plus 500 mm MgCl2. CCR5 was eluted from the beads by three successive washes with 50 μl of medium containing 200 μM C9 peptide (TETSQVAPA), 500 mm MgCl2, 100 mm(NH4)2SO4, 20 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10% glycerol, and 0.5% CymalTM-5. The total quantity of harvested CCR5 was estimated by Coomassie Blue staining of an SDS-polyacrylamide gel run with standard quantities of bovine serum albumin. Approximately 4 × 106Cf2Th/PACH/synCCR5 cells were labeled for 12 h with [35S]Met/Cys and lysed in solubilization buffer containing 1% CymalTM-5. One ml of cleared cell lysate was incubated with 100–500 μl of the gp120-containing solutions. The unlabeled JR-FL gp120 was produced in Drosophila cells (3Wu L. Gerary N.P. Wyatt R. Choe H. Parolin C. Ruffing N. Borsetti A. Dardoso A.A. Desjardin E. Newman W. Gerard C. Sodroski J. Nature. 1996; 384: 179-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (1081) Google Scholar), and the ADA and 190/197 R/S gp120 glycoproteins were produced from transiently transfected 293T cells that had been radiolabeled with [35S]Met/Cys overnight.2 Except in the case of the CD4-independent gp120 variant, 190/197 R/S, the gp120 glycoproteins (2–4 μg) were preincubated with sCD4 (2–4 μg) in 20 ml of PBS for 1 h at 22 °C prior to addition to the CCR5-containing lysates. After 12 h at 4 °C, the gp120-CCR5 complexes were precipitated with either the C11 anti-gp120 antibody (kindly provided by Dr. James Robinson, Tulane University Medical School) or with the 1D4 antibody. We compared the codon usage for opsins, the only GPCRs that are naturally highly expressed, with the codon usage for 45 other GPCRs representing a spectrum of different GPCR subfamilies. Opsin codons are biased toward those shown to be optimal for efficient translation in mammalian cells (34Andre S. Seed B. Eberle J. Schraut W. Bultmann A. Haas J. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 1497-1503Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereas other GPCRs, including CCR5, are associated with codons that are more random and, in many cases, inefficiently translated (data not shown). A codon-optimized CCR5 gene was designed, synthesized using the polymerase chain reaction, and transiently expressed in several different cell lines, using five different expression vectors (pcDNA 3.1, PACH, PND, PMT4, and pcDNA4/HisMax). The level of CCR5 expression directed by the codon-optimized gene was 2–5 times that directed by the wild-type CCR5 gene (Fig.1, A and B, and data not shown). Among the cell lines tested, CCR5 expression was the highest in Cf2Th canine thymocytes (data not shown), so these cells were used to generate stable cell lines. The PACH vector was used to express the codon-optimized gene encoding human CCR5 containing a 9-residue C-terminal epitope tag (the C9 tag) derived from bovine rhodopsin. The presence of the C9 tag allows recognition of the CCR5 protein by the 1D4 antibody (35Oprian D.D. Molday R.S. Kaufman R.J. Korana G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 8874-8878Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). CCR5 expression in the stable cell line, designated Cf2Th/PACH/synCCR5, could be enhanced 2–3-fold by treatment of the cells with sodium butyrate (Fig.1 C). Following this treatment, approximately 3–5 μg of CCR5 of high purity could be isolated from 107Cf2Th/PACH/synCCR5 cells, using techniques described below (Fig.1 D). CCR5 synthesis and turnover in Cf2Th cells were studied by pulse-chase analysis (Fig. 2). A precursor of approximately 40 kDa chased into the mature form of CCR5, which migrated as a wide band of approximately 43 kDa. The CCR5 precursor exhibited a half-life of approximately 25 min (Fig. 2 A). The half-life of the mature form of CCR5 was 11–14 h, regardless of whether CCR5 expression was directed by the wild-type or codon-optimized CCR5 gene (Fig. 2,B and C). The half-lives of the precursor and mature forms of CCR5 in HEK-293 cells were similar to those in Cf2Th cells (data not shown). In several different cell lines, a lower molecular mass (approximately 36 kDa) form of CCR5 appeared in parallel with the mature protein (Fig. 2, B andC). This lower molecular mass form of CCR5 was expressed at lower levels than the mature form of CCR5 and has not been completely characterized. Its identity as a CCR5 isoform was confirmed by its precipitation by the 1D4 antibody and the anti-CCR5 antibody 2D7 and by mass spectrometry (Figs. 2 and3 A and data not shown).Figure 3Maintenance of native CCR5 conformation in buffers containing different detergents.Approximately 4 × 106 [35S]Met/Cys-labeled Cf2Th/PACH/synCCR5 cells were lysed in 1 ml of ice-cold solubilization buffer (100 mm(NH4)2SO4, 20 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10% glycerol) supplemented with a protease inhibitor mixture and 1% (w/v) of different detergents. After 30 min of solubilization and 30 min of centrifugation, the cleared cell lysates were separated into two equal portions. One portion was precipitated with 2D7 (a conformation-dependent antibody against CCR5) and other portion with 1D4 (an antibody that recognizes the linear C9 epitope tag). The precipitates were run on SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and two parameters were examined: 1) the total quantity of CCR5 precipitated by the 1D4 antibody, and 2) the ratio of CCR5 precipitated by the 2D7 antibody relative to that precipitated by the 1D4 antibody. A, precipitates from cells lysed in buffer containing CymalTM-5, DHPC and Fos-choline™-14. Similar levels of CCR5 were precipitated by the 1D4 antibody from these lysates, but the percentage of conformationally intact CCR5 varied (98% in CymalTM-5, 10% in DHPC, and 13% in Fos-Choline™-14). The sample run in the right-hand lane (asterisk) was the same as in the lane labeled 1D4 but was boiled prior to running on the gel, a procedure that results in the formation of high molecular weight multimers of CCR5. B, the amounts of CCR5 precipitated by the 1D4 (○) and 2D7 (●) antibodies from cell lysates containing different detergents, over a range of pH values.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Membrane protein purification requires solubilization of the membranes, typically through the use of detergents. A broad spectrum of conditions was studied to arrive at the composition of the buffer that allowed solubilization and isolation of native CCR5. This optimization was guided by a comparison of the amount of solubilized CCR5 capable of being precipitated by the 2D7 antibody, which recognizes a conformation-dependent CCR5 epitope (36Wu L. LaRosa G. Kassam N. Gordon C.J. Heath H. Ruffing N. Chen H. Humblias J. Samson M. Parmentier M. Moore J.P. Mackay C.R. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 1373-1381Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar), with that able to be precipitated by the 1D4 antibody directed against the linear C9 epitope tag. In this manner, the percentage of solubilized CCR5 remaining in a native conformation could be estimated (Fig. 3 A). Eighteen detergents, most of which were designed specifically for the extraction and purification of membrane proteins, were studied. In terms of the quantity of isolated CCR5 protein, as well as the percentage of protein in a conformation able to be recognized by the 2D7 antibody, the most effective detergents were DDM, CymalTM-5, and CymalTM-6 (Fig. 3 B). Of these detergents, CymalTM-5 exhibits the highest critical micelle concentration (2.4 mm), facilitating dialysis of the detergent from the protein solution for the purposes of membrane reconstitution and/or crystallization. We also found that a CCR5 conformation competent for binding HIV-1 gp120 was best preserved in buffers containing CymalTM-5 (see below). Therefore, CymalTM-5 was used for further refinement of the CCR5 solubilization/isolation protocol, examining a number of variables (salt composition and concentration, pH, temperature, and minor additives) known to influence the stability of solubilized proteins (37Hamaguchi K. The Protein Molecule. Conformation, Stability and Folding. Japan Scientific Societies Press, Springer-Verlag, New York1992Google Scholar). Ammonium sulfate and glycerol were found to prolong the existence of a CCR5 conformation capable of being recognized by the 2D7 antibody (data not shown). The optimized CCR5 solubilization buffer was composed of 100 mm (NH4)2SO4, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10% glycerol, and 1% CymalTM-5. To examine whether the solubilized CCR5 was capable of binding the HIV-1 gp120 glycoprotein, coprecipitation experiments were conducted using three different gp120 glycoproteins. The JR-FL and ADA gp120 glycoproteins, like all characterized wild-type R5 HIV-1 envelope glycoproteins, bind CCR5 efficiently only in the presence of CD4 (3Wu L. Gerary N.P. Wyatt R. Choe H. Parolin C. Ruffing N. Borsetti A. Dardoso A.A. Desjardin E. Newman W. Gerard C. Sodroski J. Nature. 1996; 384: 179-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (1081) Google Scholar, 4Trkola A. Dragic T. Arthos J. Binley J.M. Olson W.C. Allaway G.P. Cheng-Mayer C. Robinson J. Maddon P.J. Moore J.P. Nature. 1996; 384: 184-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (959) Google Scholar). By contrast, the 190/197 R/S variant of the ADA gp120 glycoprotein was derived from a virus adapted in culture to replicate on CD4-negative, CCR5-positive cells,2 and it therefore binds CCR5 in the absence of CD4. The mature CCR5 protein was precipitated from cell lysates by the C11 anti-gp120 antibody when unlabeled JR-FL gp120 and soluble CD4 (sCD4) were added to the lysates (Fig.4 A), but not when either gp120 or sCD4 were left out of the mixture (data not shown). The C11 antibody precipitated the mature CCR5 protein when radiolabeled 190/197 R/S gp120 was added to the lysates without sCD4 (Fig. 4 B). Conversely, the 1D4 antibody precipitated the labeled 190/197 R/S gp120 glycoprotein from these lysates. In the coprecipitation experiments using the C11 anti-gp120 antibody, only the mature form of CCR5, and not the 36-kDa CCR5 isoform, was precipitated (Fig. 4). CCR5 has been shown to be posttranslationally modified by O-linked carbohydrates and by tyrosine sulfation (33Farzan M. Mirzabekov T. Kolchinsky P. Wyatt R. Cayabyab M. Gerard N. Gerard G. Sodroski J. Choe H. Cell. 1999; 96: 667-676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar). The latter modification has been suggested to facilitate the efficiency with which CCR5 is utilized as an HIV-1 coreceptor (33Farzan M. Mirzabekov T. Kolchinsky P. Wyatt R. Cayabyab M. Gerard N. Gerard G. Sodroski J. Choe H. Cell. 1999; 96: 667-676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar). To examine the relationship of sulfation to the observed conversion of the CCR5 precursor to the higher molecular mass, mature form of the protein, a pulse-chase analysis of Cf2Th/PACH/synCCR5 cells labeled with either [35S]cysteine/methionine or [35S]sulfate was performed. Sulfate label was incorporated only into the mature form of CCR5 (Fig.5). The recognition of the precursor and mature, sulfated forms of CCR5 by the 1D4 and 2D7 antibodies and by gp120-sCD4 complexes was examined (Fig. 5). The conformation-dependent 2D7 antibody precipitated the CCR5 precursor at an efficiency approximately 20% lower than that seen for the 1D4 antibody. Complexes of the ADA gp120 glycoprotein, sCD4, and the C11 antibody preferentially precipitated the mature, sulfated form of CCR5; the precipitation of the CCR5 precursor by this complex was approximately 5-fold less efficient than that of the mature CCR5 protein (Fig. 5). Similarly, the mature CCR5 protein was recognized more efficiently than the CCR5 precursor by a complex of the C11 antibody and the 190/197 R/S gp120 glycoprotein, in the absence of sCD4 (data not shown). GPCRs serve as therapeutic targets for over 30% of the pharmaceutical agents currently used in clinical practice (26Stadel J.M. Wilson S. Bergsma D.J. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1997; 18: 430-437Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Specific GPCRs, most of which are chemokine receptors, are necessary cofactors for HIV-1 entry. Progress toward intervening in virus-coreceptor interaction would be greatly expedited by the development of screening assays in which relevant ligands bind purified, native chemokine receptors. We provide herein an experimental approach to the purification of human CCR5 that yields a native protein capable of binding the HIV-1 gp120 envelope glycoprotein and a conformation-dependent antibody. The approach should be generally applicable to other GPCRs. Achieving adequate levels of CCR5 in an expression system is essential for attempts to establish screening assays and for structural analyses. Codon optimization, empirical screening of plasmids and cell types, and FACS screening yielded stable lines expressing a level of CCR5 approaching that achieved for bovine rhodopsin. In studies not shown, we compared the synthesis, steady-state levels, and turnover of the codon-optimized CCR5 with those of bovine rhodopsin transiently expressed in the same cell type by the same vector and detected using identical epitope tags. The results indicated that the synthesis and steady-state levels of rhodopsin were approximately 5-fold higher than those of CCR5, whereas the half-lives of the two proteins were comparable. This difference was apparently compensated for by the establishment and selection of the stable Cf2Th/PACH/synCCR5 cell lines. Scale-up of these cells could allow the purification of milligram quantities of the CCR5 protein. We evaluated the conformational integrity of CCR5 solubilized in several different detergents, including DDM, which has been employed in the study of some other GPCRs (38Reeves P. Thurmond R.L. Khorana G.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 94: 7784-7790Google Scholar, 39Jones M.N. Int. J. Pharm. 1999; 177: 137-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). We show that CymalTM-5 was at least as effective as DDM in solubilizing CCR5 in a native conformation. Human CCR5 retained a native conformation in CymalTM-5-containing buffers for a few days at 4 °C, and bound HIV-1 gp120 more efficiently than CCR5 solubilized in DDM (data not shown). A further advantage of CymalTM-5 is its critical micelle concentration, which is 14 times higher than that of DDM, the mild detergent commonly used for membrane protein biochemistry. The high critical micelle concentration of CymalTM-5 should facilitate its removal during reconstitution of the GPCR into membranes or for crystallization. The C-terminal C9 peptide provides an easy and rapid means for purification of CCR5 using the anti-peptide antibody 1D4. The presence of the C9 epitope tag does not affect the ability of CCR5 to function as an HIV-1 entry cofactor or as a receptor for chemokine ligands (data not shown). The purified CCR5 can be gently eluted from the 1D4 antibody by using the free C9 peptide as a competitor (35Oprian D.D. Molday R.S. Kaufman R.J. Korana G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 8874-8878Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar, 38Reeves P. Thurmond R.L. Khorana G.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 94: 7784-7790Google Scholar). The synthesis and turnover of CCR5 were examined in the course of this study. Approximately 80% of the 40-kDa CCR5 precursor is competent for binding the conformation-dependent 2D7 antibody, indicating that a native structure is achieved rapidly after synthesis of the protein. The 40-kDa CCR5 precursor is rapidly converted into a more slowly migrating form. This 43-kDa form of CCR5 is evident within 10 min of labeling the CCR5 precursor. Most of this shift in molecular mass derives from the addition of O-linked carbohydrates to the CCR5 protein (27Helmreich E.J.M. Hofmann K.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1286: 285-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The single potential N-linked glycosylation site on CCR5 is not utilized (27Helmreich E.J.M. Hofmann K.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1286: 285-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Once synthesized, the mature CCR5 protein exhibits a half-life of 11–14 h. The tyrosines in the N terminus of the 43-kDa CCR5 form are modified by sulfation, suggesting that sulfation occurs after O-glycosylation. The incorporation of the sulfate label into the 43-kDa CCR5 protein continuously increases over a 4-h labeling period. Because tyrosine sulfation typically occurs in the trans-Golgi network, late in the secretory pathway (15Huttner W.B. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1988; 50: 363-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar), some sulfate addition may be occurring on CCR5 molecules that have been recycled from the cell surface back to the Golgi. Our results indicate that the HIV-1 gp120 glycoprotein preferentially recognizes the mature, sulfated form of CCR5, consistent with the proposed role of sulfated tyrosines in gp120 binding and HIV-1 entry (33Farzan M. Mirzabekov T. Kolchinsky P. Wyatt R. Cayabyab M. Gerard N. Gerard G. Sodroski J. Choe H. Cell. 1999; 96: 667-676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar). The availability of methods to purify adequate amounts of CCR5 should expedite progress on understanding the structure and function of this key HIV-1 coreceptor and facilitate the search for effective inhibitors of virus-coreceptor interactions.

https://openalex.org/W2330176638,"Mutations in the genes encoding for Met, Ret and Kit receptor tyrosine kinases invariably result in increased kinase activity and in the acquisition of transforming potential. However, the requirement of receptor ligands for the transformation process is still unclear. We have investigated the role of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), the high-affinity ligand for Met, in mutant Met-mediated cell transformation. We provide evidence that the transforming potential displayed by mutant forms of Met found in human cancer is not only sensitive but entirely dependent on the presence of HGF, by showing that mutant Met transforms NIH3T3 fibroblasts, which produce endogenous HGF, but is not able to transform epithelial cells, unless exogenous HGF is supplied. Accordingly, mutant Met-induced transformation of NIH3T3 cells can be inhibited by HGF antagonists and increased by HGF stimulation. We also show that an engineered Met receptor which contains an oncogenic mutation but is impaired in its ability to bind HGF completely loses its transforming activity, which can be rescued by causing receptor dimerization using a monoclonal antibody. These results indicate that point mutations resulting in Met kinase activation are necessary but not sufficient to cause cell transformation, the latter being dependent on ligand-induced receptor dimerization. They also suggest that mutant Met-driven tumour growth depends on the availability and tissue distribution of active HGF, and provide proof-of-concept for the treatment of mutant-Met related pathologies by HGF-antagonizing drugs."
https://openalex.org/W2331136216,"Down regulation of the ING1 candidate tumour suppressor promotes growth in soft agar and focus formation in vitro and tumour formation in vivo. ING1 encodes a nuclear, cell cycle-regulated protein, overexpression of which efficiently blocks cell growth and is capable of inducing apoptosis in different experimental systems. Here we present the first report of ING1 mutation and expression analysis in a total of 452 cancer samples. One germline missense alteration and three germline silent alterations were detected in 377 primary breast cancers while marked (2 - 10-fold) decreases in ING1 mRNA expression were seen in 44% of primary breast cancers and in ten of ten breast cancer cell lines examined. Furthermore, the majority of breast cancers (58%) showing decreased ING1 expression had metastasized to regional lymph nodes whereas only 9% of cancers with elevated ING1 expression, compared to adjacent normal tissues, were metastatic. Thus, ING1 mutation is very rare in breast or ovarian cancers, however, repression of ING1 expression frequently accompanies tumour development of breast cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2020982132,"N-Acetylneuraminic acid is the most common naturally occurring sialic acid, as well as being the biosynthetic precursor of this group of compounds. UDP-GlcNAc 2-epimerase/N-acetylmannosamine kinase has been shown to be the key enzyme of N-acetylneuraminic acid biosynthesis in rat liver, and it is a regulator of cell surface sialylation. The N-terminal region of this bifunctional enzyme displays sequence similarities with prokaryotic UDP-GlcNAc 2-epimerases, whereas the sequence of its C-terminal region is similar to sequences of members of the sugar kinase superfamily. High level overexpression of active enzyme was established by using the baculovirus/Sf9 system. For functional characterization, site-directed mutagenesis was performed on different conserved amino acid residues. The histidine mutants H45A, H110A, H132A, H155A, and H157A showed a drastic loss of epimerase activity with almost unchanged kinase activity. Conversely, the mutants D413N, D413K, and R420M in the putative kinase active site lost their kinase activity but retained their epimerase activity. To estimate the structural perturbation effect due to site-directed mutagenesis, the oligomeric state of all mutants was determined by gel filtration analysis. The mutants D413N, D413K, and R420M as well as H45A were shown to form a hexamer like the wild-type enzyme, indicating little influence of mutation on protein folding. Histidine mutants H155A and H157A formed mainly trimeric enzyme with small amounts of hexamer. Oligomerization of mutants H110A and H132A was also significantly different from that of the wild-type enzyme. Therefore the loss of epimerase activity in mutants H110A, H132A, H155A, and H157A can largely be attributed to incorrect protein folding. In contrast, the mutation site of mutant H45A seems to be involved directly in the epimerization process, and the amino acids Asp-413 and Arg-420 of UDP-GlcNAc 2-epimerase/N-acetylmannosamine kinase are essential for the phosphorylation process. The fact that either epimerase or kinase activity are lost selectively provides evidence for the existence of two active sites working quite independently. N-Acetylneuraminic acid is the most common naturally occurring sialic acid, as well as being the biosynthetic precursor of this group of compounds. UDP-GlcNAc 2-epimerase/N-acetylmannosamine kinase has been shown to be the key enzyme of N-acetylneuraminic acid biosynthesis in rat liver, and it is a regulator of cell surface sialylation. The N-terminal region of this bifunctional enzyme displays sequence similarities with prokaryotic UDP-GlcNAc 2-epimerases, whereas the sequence of its C-terminal region is similar to sequences of members of the sugar kinase superfamily. High level overexpression of active enzyme was established by using the baculovirus/Sf9 system. For functional characterization, site-directed mutagenesis was performed on different conserved amino acid residues. The histidine mutants H45A, H110A, H132A, H155A, and H157A showed a drastic loss of epimerase activity with almost unchanged kinase activity. Conversely, the mutants D413N, D413K, and R420M in the putative kinase active site lost their kinase activity but retained their epimerase activity. To estimate the structural perturbation effect due to site-directed mutagenesis, the oligomeric state of all mutants was determined by gel filtration analysis. The mutants D413N, D413K, and R420M as well as H45A were shown to form a hexamer like the wild-type enzyme, indicating little influence of mutation on protein folding. Histidine mutants H155A and H157A formed mainly trimeric enzyme with small amounts of hexamer. Oligomerization of mutants H110A and H132A was also significantly different from that of the wild-type enzyme. Therefore the loss of epimerase activity in mutants H110A, H132A, H155A, and H157A can largely be attributed to incorrect protein folding. In contrast, the mutation site of mutant H45A seems to be involved directly in the epimerization process, and the amino acids Asp-413 and Arg-420 of UDP-GlcNAc 2-epimerase/N-acetylmannosamine kinase are essential for the phosphorylation process. The fact that either epimerase or kinase activity are lost selectively provides evidence for the existence of two active sites working quite independently. N-Acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac) 1The abbreviations used are:Neu5AcN-acetylneuraminic acidManNAcN-acetylmannosaminePAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis is the precursor of sialic acids, a group of important molecules in biological communication. Sialic acids have been shown to be involved in cellular adhesion (1Yang P. Major D. Rutishauser U. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23039-23044Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Edelman G.M.

FASEB J. 1997; 11: 248-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar). Glycoproteins can be protected against degradation by sialylation (4Fernandes A.I. Gregoriadis G. Biochim. Biophys.

N-acetylneuraminic acid N-acetylmannosamine polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis The biosynthesis of Neu5Ac in rat liver is initiated and regulated by its key enzyme, UDP-N-acetylglucosamine 2-epimerase (EC5.1.3.14)/N-acetylmannosamine kinase (EC 2.7.1.60) (8Hinderlich S. Stäsche R. Zeitler R. Reutter W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24313-24318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it was shown recently that UDP-GlcNAc 2-epimerase is a regulator of cell surface sialylation (9Keppler O.T. Hinderlich S. Langner J. Schwartz-Albiez R. Reutter W. Pawlita M. Science. 1999; 284: 1372-1376Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). The bifunctional enzyme catalyzes the conversion of UDP-GlcNAc to ManNAc and the consecutive phosphorylation to form ManNAc 6-phosphate. The homogeneous enzyme from rat liver has an apparent molecular mass of 75 kDa. It assembles as a hexamer possessing both enzyme activities. In vitro it partly decays to dimers, which possess only the kinase activity. CMP-Neu5Ac, the end product of sialic acid biosynthesis, has been shown to be a competitive feed-back inhibitor of UDP-GlcNAc 2-epimerase activity (10Kornfeld S. Kornfeld R. Neufeld E.F. O'Brian P.J.

The overall amino acid identity between the enzymes from rat and mouse is 99.4%, and between rat and human the identity is 98.6% (13Seppala R. Veli-Pekka L. Gahl W.A J. Am. Hum. Gen. 1999; 64: 1563-1569Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), showing that UDP-GlcNAc 2-epimerase/ManNAc kinase is highly conserved in mammalian organisms. Bifunctional enzymes are quite rare in mammalian metabolism. Further examples of enzymes catalyzing consecutive steps of a metabolic pathway are heparan sulfate/heparinN-deacetylase/N-sulfotransferase, and 3′-phosphoadenosine 5′-phosphosulfate synthase. Sequence analysis and functional studies show that both of these enzymes might have evolved by gene fusion from two independent enzymes, which in part are still present in lower organisms. In 3′-phosphoadenosine 5′-phosphosulfate synthase the functional domains were expressed separately (14Venkatachalam K.V. Akita H. Strott C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19311-19320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), whereas in heparan sulfate/heparinN-deacetylase/N-sulfotransferase only the sulfotransferase activity can be separately correlated to a distinct region, i.e. the carboxyl half of the enzyme (15Berninsone P. Hirschberg C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25556-25559Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In the present paper we report the establishment of high level overexpression of UDP-GlcNAc 2-epimerase/ManNAc kinase, results of sequence analysis, and alignment-guided site-directed mutagenesis of the bifunctional enzyme. UDP-[U-14C]GlcNAc and [1-14C]ManNAc were from ICN (Eschwege, Germany). All other chemicals were from Sigma and Roche Molecular Biochemicals. The UDP-GlcNAc 2-epimerase/ManNAc kinase coding cDNA (11Stäsche R. Hinderlich S. Weise C. Effertz K. Lucka L. Moormann P. Reutter W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24319-24324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) was amplified by polymerase chain reaction from pBluescriptII (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using primers designed to contain a forward XhoI site and a reverse 3′-KpnI site. About 0.5 μg of product was excised, eluted from agarose gels, and digested first with XhoI. The restricted DNA was precipitated and afterward restricted with KpnI. To inactivate the restriction enzyme, the DNA was extracted with phenol-chloroform. An aliquot of the resulting 5′-XhoI-DNA-3′-KpnI was ligated to the double-restricted (XhoI, KpnI) vector pFastBac1 (Life Technologies, Inc.). The transformed ligation product was mini-prepped and verified by sequencing (16Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Biotechnology. 1992; 24: 104-108PubMed Google Scholar). The recombinant baculovirus containing the coding sequence of the UDP-GlcNAc 2-epimerase/ManNAc kinase was produced by using the Bac to Bac system according to the procedures supplied by the manufacturer (Life Technologies, Inc.). The system is based on transposon-mediated insertion of the foreign gene into the baculovirus genome under transcriptional regulation of the polyhedrine gene (17Luckow V.A. Lee S.C. Barry G.F. Olins P.O. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 4566-4579Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Propagation of the recombinant virus as well as wild-type Autographa californica nuclear polyhedrosis virus (strain) was performed according to procedures described by O'Reilly et al. (18O'Reilly D.R. Miller L.K. Luckow V.A. Baculovirus Expression Vectors: A Laboratory Manual. W. H. Freeman and Company, New York1992Google Scholar). Lepidopteran Spodoptera frugiperdacells (Sf9, Life Technologies, Inc.) were maintained as monolayer cultures in plastic flasks (Greiner GmbH, Frickhausen, Germany) or in suspension by using Erlenmeyer flasks (100 ml) on orbital shakers (100–120 rpm) at 27 °C. Cells were grown in TC-100 medium (Biochrom, Berlin, Germany) supplemented with 2 mml-glutamine, 10% fetal calf serum (Biochrom), or in serum-free SF900 II medium (Life Technologies, Inc.). Antibiotics (100 units/ml penicillin, 40 units/ml streptomycin) were added to both culture media. Sf9 cells were grown to a density of 2 × 106 cells/ml, then infected at a multiplicity of infection of 0.1. During infection, cells were grown in suspension culture in an orbital shaker at 120 rpm and at 27 °C. After an optimal infection period of 60 h, the cells were pelleted and disrupted in lysis buffer (10 mm NaH2PO4, pH 7.5, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) by tipping them up and down several times in a 1-ml canule. The ratio of cells/lysis buffer volume was adjusted to 2 × 107 cells/ml. The crude cell lysate was clarified by ultracentrifugation (100,000 × g, 40 min). After harvesting the cells, all procedures were carried out at 4 °C. UDP-GlcNAc 2-epimerase and ManNAc kinase activity were measured by a modified method of Zeitler et al. (19Zeitler R. Banzer J.-P. Bauer C. Reutter W. Biometals. 1992; 5: 103-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). In brief, the final volume of incubation mixtures was 225 μl; incubations were carried out at 37 °C for 30 min, and reactions were stopped by the addition of 350 μl of ethanol. UDP-GlcNAc 2-epimerase assay: 45 mmNa2HPO4, pH 7.5, 10 mmMgCl2, 1 mm UDP-GlcNAc, 25 nCi of UDP-[1-14C]GlcNAc. ManNAc kinase assay: 60 mmTris/HCl, pH 8.1, 20 mm MgCl2, 5 mmManNAc, 50 nCi of [1-14C]ManNAc, 20 mm ATP (disodium salt). Radiolabeled compounds were separated by paper chromatography as described earlier (19Zeitler R. Banzer J.-P. Bauer C. Reutter W. Biometals. 1992; 5: 103-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Radioactivity was determined in the presence of Ultima Gold XR (Packard, Groninger, Netherlands) in a Tri-Carb 1900 CA liquid scintillation analyzer (Packard). Protein concentration was measured by the method of Bradford (20Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216412) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. One unit of enzyme activity was defined as the formation of 1 μmol of product/min at 37 °C. Specific activity was expressed as milliunits/mg of protein. The mutagenic oligonucleotides used to generate the mutant constructs are shown in Table I. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the QuickChangeTM site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, Heidelberg, Germany). In brief, a nonidentical duplicate of the original vector is produced by a polymerase chain reaction-like amplification using Pfu polymerase and primers containing the desired mutation. The parental template is then digested specifically by the restriction enzyme DpnI, which cuts only dam-methylated DNA (target sequence 5′-Gm6ATC-3′). The nicked vector DNA incorporating the desired mutations is transformed into Escherichia coli.Table IMutagenic oligonucleotides for site-directed mutagenesis of UDP-GlcNAc 2-epimerase/ManNAc-kinaseNameSequenceH45AGGTGCTGGGC TCTgcCCTGA TCGACGACTA CGGH110ACCTGACATCA TGATTGTTgc CGGAGACCGA TTTGACGH132ACCGCATCCTT gcCATTGAAG GAGGH155ACCATAACAAA ACTGGCTgcC TACCACGTGT GCH157ACTGGCTCACT ACgcCGTGTG CTGCACCD413LGCCTTGGCTG TTaAaCTCGG GGGGACGD413NGCCTTGGCTG TTaATCTCGG GGGGACGR420MGGACGAATCT GAtgGTGGCG ATAGTTAGCMismatches with the template are indicated by lowercase letters.

All mutant constructs were controlled by sequencing with the Sanger dideoxy chain termination reaction for double-stranded DNA. Overall sequence similarities were checked using the PSI-Blast software and the nr data base. Protein sequences of rat UDP-GlcNAc 2-epimerase/ManNAc kinase and four (putative) prokaryotic UDP-GlcNAc 2-epimerases (ESPC_BURSO, WEBC_ECOLI, RFBC_SALBO, YVVH_BACSU, Swiss-Prot data base) and a protein involved in ManNAc biosynthesis (synX, PIR data base) were aligned using the MultAlin software (multiple sequence alignment with hierarchical clustering (21Corpet F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 10881-10890Crossref PubMed Scopus (4317) Google Scholar), which is based on the blast algorithm). Protein sequences of rat UDP-GlcNAc 2-epimerase/ManNAc kinase, hexokinase of yeast (HXKB_YEAST), glucokinase of rat (HXXH_RAT), fucokinase ofE. coli (FUCK_ECOLI), glycerokinase of E. coli(Bacillus subtilis) (GLPK_ECOLI (GLPK_BACSU)), glucokinase of B. subtilis, xylulokinase of E. coli(GNTK_BACSU, XYLK_ECOLI), ribulokinase of Salmonella typhimurium (KIRI_SALTY) (all nr data base) were aligned using the same software. The oligomeric structures of wild-type and mutated UDP-GlcNAc 2-epimerase/ManNAc kinase were determined with freshly prepared cytosol by gel filtration on a Superdex 200 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For elution, a buffer containing 100 mm NaCl,10 mmNaH2PO4, pH 7.5, 1 mmdithiothreitol, and 1 mm EDTA was used. Standard proteins were ferritin (440 kDa), γ-globulin (156 kDa), ovalbumin (44 kDa), and myoglobulin (17 kDa). Fractions obtained at a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min were analyzed by SDS-PAGE/Western blot analysis as described earlier (8Hinderlich S. Stäsche R. Zeitler R. Reutter W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24313-24318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar) and assayed for enzyme activity as described above. Gel filtration was also performed with older cytosol fractions to investigate their rate of decay. Sequence analysis was performed by comparing the sequence of UDP-GlcNAc 2-epimerase/ManNAc kinase of rat with the nonredundant GenBank™ CDS using the PSI-Blast software. As reported earlier (22Effertz K. Hinderlich S. Reutter W. Glycobiology. 1998; 88 (abstr.): 1096Google Scholar), we found sequence similarities with kinases and epimerases in different halves of the protein, indicating that different regions are involved in the formation of the active sites for epimerization and phosphorylation (Fig. 3 and Table II).Table IIAmino acid identities and similarities of rat UDP-GlcNAc 2-epimerase/ManNAc kinase NH2 and COOH regions with prokaryotic UDP-GlcNAc 2-epimerases and members of the sugar kinase superfamilyIdentitiesPositivesGaps%%%N-terminal regionaAligned amino acid residues 1–376. synX_MENSU32554 RFFE_ECOLI223914 YVVH_BACSU21399 EPSC_BURSO23468 RFBC_SALBO213915C-terminal regionbAligned amino acid residues 410–684.

The synX protein of E. coli catalyzes either the interconversion of GlcNAc-6-phosphate to ManNAc 6-phosphate or the dephosphorylation of the latter to produce ManNAc (23Swartley J.S. Stephens D.S. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 1530-1534Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The sequence similarities suggest that synX is an epimerase rather than a kinase. In contrast to the eukaryotic epimerase, the prokaryotic epimerase inverts the stereochemistry at C-2 without release of UDP. Mechanistic similarities between the eukaryotic and the prokaryotic epimerization process can be assumed, as in both enzymatic reactions 2-acetamidoglucal is an intermediate (24Morgan P.M. Sala R.F. Tanner M.E. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1997; 119: 10269-10277Crossref Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 25Sommar K.M. Ellis D.B. Biochim. Biophys.

Acta. 1979; 583: 403-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). This assumption implies the existence of similar protein structures in both cases. In the prokaryotic enzyme, deprotonation at C-2 is the rate-limiting step of the process (24Morgan P.M. Sala R.F. Tanner M.E. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1997; 119: 10269-10277Crossref Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Because histidines are often connected with deprotonation reactions, we mutated four conserved and one semiconserved histidine (Fig. 1, 3) to determine their role in catalysis. In the C-terminal half of the UDP-GlcNAc 2-epimerase/ManNAc kinase, all of the 5 characteristic motifs described for the ATP binding domain common to functionally divergent proteins (27Bork P. Sander C. Valencia A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7290-7294Crossref PubMed Scopus (701) Google Scholar) were identified. Similarities stretching over amino acids 410–684 are highest for four prokaryotic hexokinases (Table II), whereas the several eukaryotic hexokinases match best in-between the phosphate 1 motif of the ATP binding domain. Using site-directed mutagenesis, several amino acids in the conserved motif phosphate 1 of mammalian hexokinase have been shown to be essential for catalysis (28Baijal M. Wilson J.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 321: 413-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 29Zeng C. Fromm H.J. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13157-13164Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Molecular modeling of ATP in the crystal structure of yeast hexokinase predicted interactions of these residues with ATP. The conserved aspartate is predicted to interact with ATP-complexed Mg2+; the conserved arginine is predicted to interact with α- and β-phosphate oxygens (30Zeng C. Aleshin A.E. Hardie J.B. Harrison R.W. Fromm H.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13157-13164Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The analogous positions in UDP-GlcNAc 2-epimerase/ManNAc kinase were mutated to investigate their involvement in the catalytic process (Figs. 2 and 3). For functional characterization, high level overexpression of UDP-GlcNAc 2-epimerase/ManNAc kinase was established using the baculovirus expression system. Insect cells were infected with a recombinant baculovirus containing the cDNA of the enzyme or its respective mutants. All recombinant expressed proteins migrated at the same position (75 kDa) as the rat liver enzyme in SDS-PAGE (Fig. 4). As estimated by comparing the signal intensities after staining with Coomassie Brillant Blue, 20–30 percent of the total cytosolic protein fraction consists of recombinant enzyme. Furthermore, cytosolic extracts of all mutants and the wild-type enzyme are immunoreactive, with a polyclonal antibody specific against UDP-GlcNAc 2-epimerase/ManNAc kinase (8Hinderlich S. Stäsche R. Zeitler R. Reutter W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24313-24318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar) (data not shown). The native molecular mass of recombinant UDP-GlcNAc 2-epimerase/ManNAc kinase was estimated to be 450 kDa by size exclusion column chromatography, indicating that the expressed protein forms a hexamer. The recombinant enzyme dissociated partly into dimers, which retained only the kinase activity. This phenomenon was reported for the rat liver enzyme as well (Fig. 5) (11Stäsche R. Hinderlich S.

Chem. 1997; 272: 24319-24324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar).Figure 5Determination of oligomeric structure of overexpressed UDP-GlcNAc 2-epimerase/ManNAc kinase. Fractions were analyzed for UDP-GlcNAc 2-epimerase (▪) and ManNAc kinase activity (●) and were also subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis. Estimation of retention times of hexameric and dimeric enzyme was performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.”WT, wild type; mU, milliunits.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To quantitate the cytosolic background activities, the UDP-GlcNAc 2-epimerase and ManNAc kinase activities of uninfected insect cells were investigated. We found that cytosolic fractions of uninfected Sf9 cells show an epimerase activity of 0.06 milliunits/mg. The fact that this activity can be inhibited by 0.1 mmCMP-Neu5Ac, the feedback inhibitor of UDP-GlcNAc 2-epimerase activity in rat liver, suggests the presence of this enzyme in insect cells (Fig. 6, panel B). The specific activity is about 30 times less than that in rat liver cytosol. In contrast, the apparent averaged ManNAc kinase activity of insect cell cytosol is 5 milliunits/mg, about 50 times higher than the UDP-GlcNAc 2-epimerase activity. A possible explanation is that other cytosolic kinases are able to phosphorylate ManNAc, as demonstrated recently for the rat liver N-acetylglucosamine kinase (31Hinderlich S. Nöhring S. Weise C. Franke P. Stäsche R. Reutter W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 252: 133-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Infection of Sf9 cells with the wild-type enzyme virus resulted in an average specific cytosolic epimerase activity of 890 ± 310 milliunits/mg and in an average specific cytosolic kinase activity of 840 ± 276 milliunits/mg (Fig. 7, panels A andB). Compared with cytosolic extracts of rat liver, the specific activities in insect cell cytosols after infection were increased about 400-fold for both activities. Thus, the specific epimerase activity in insect cytosol after overexpression corresponds to that of the homogeneous enzyme from rat liver cytosol (8Hinderlich S. Stäsche R. Zeitler R. Reutter W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24313-24318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). All histidine mutants displayed kinase activities in the same order of magnitude as the wild-type enzyme. On the other hand they all lost their epimerase activity almost completely (Fig. 7, panel A). Differences in the specific kinase activities should correlate with the differences in the expression level of the enzyme. The residual epimerase activities were not significantly higher than those assayed with uninfected cells. The mutants in the putative kinase active site showed the inverse behavior; they displayed epimerase activities comparable to the wild-type-enzyme, whereas the kinase activities were reduced drastically. Compared with the mutation to lysine, the mutation of aspartate 413 to asparagine seems to result in a slightly higher epimerase and residual kinase activities. The residual kinase activities of all mutants in the ATP binding motif are significantly higher than the background activities measured in the two negative controls (Fig. 7, panel B). For further characterization, the inhibition of the recombinant enzyme by the native feed-back inhibitor CMP-Neu5Ac was investigated. We could show that 0.1 mm CMP-Neu5Ac inhibits the wild type epimerase activity completely, whereas 0.1 mm N-acetylneuraminic acid does not influence the activity at all (Fig. 6, panel A). To determine whether the allosteric binding site is functionally intact in the epimerase-active mutants D413N, D413K, and R420M, these were assayed in the presence of CMP-Neu5Ac. The epimerase activity of all three mutants was inhibited almost completely by 0.1 mmCMP-Neu5Ac (Fig. 6, panel B). To determine whether the loss of activity due to site-directed mutagenesis can be attributed to a disturbed oligomerization process, we performed size exclusion chromatography with all mutant proteins. The obtained fractions were analyzed by Western blotting for the protein and were assayed for epimerase and kinase activity. Western blot analysis of the fractions obtained after size exclusion chromatography revealed that all three mutants are able to build a hexamer (Fig.8 A); partial dissociation of the hexamer results in a dimer as observed for the wild-type enzyme. Only the hexamer shows epimerase activity. The distribution of residual kinase activity over the molecular weight spectrum shows a major maximum at the molecular mass of the hexamer and a minor peak at the molecular mass of the dimer, which is evidence for specific residual activity (Fig. 8 B). Both mutation of aspartate to lysine (i.e. an inversion of polarity) or the neutralization of the charge of aspartate 413 by mutation to asparagine had no observable effect on oligomerization. In contrast, although the epimerase activities remain equal, the residual kinase activities after gel filtration of D413N is slightly increased over that of D413K. Taken together these results show that site-directed mutagenesis of the positions Asp-413 and Arg-420 does not interfere with enzyme oligomerization, indicating that there is no influence on protein folding. These mutants can be grouped according to three types of oligomerization behavior (Fig. 9).The first one, H45A, forms a kinase-active hexamer (Fig. 9, Type I). In this case, site-directed mutagenesis does not influence the oligomerization process. In cross-linking experiments both the hexameric enzyme and the dimeric enzyme were detected (data not shown). The neighboring mutants, H155A and H157A, constitute the third group (Fig. 9, Type III); they form only small amounts of hexamer, whereas the maximum protein content and maximum kinase activity are found at molecular weights corresponding to a trimeric state. Because no dissociation to dimers was observed, these mutations seem to inhibit the dimerization process, and consequently, the formation of larger stable amounts of hexameric enzyme. As shown by Western blot analysis after size exclusion chromatography, the molecular weight distribution for mutant enzymes His-110 and His-132 is wider (Fig. 9, Type II). The Western blot signals are in good agreement with overlapping trimeric and hexameric states of the enzyme. In this case, the second group would be a hybrid of group one and three, where the dimerization process is partially inhibited. In this study we have identified amino acids needed for the catalytic activity of the key enzyme of Neu5Ac biosynthesis, UDP-GlcNAc 2-epimerase/ManNAc kinase. The catalytically essential residues were shown to be in different regions of the enzyme for epimerase activity and kinase activity. The data were obtained by overexpression of the enzyme in insect cells, sequence alignment-guided site-directed mutagenesis, and catalytic and structural characterization of the different mutants. Sequence analysis revealed homologies between prokaryotic epimerases and the N-terminal region of UDP-GlcNAc 2-epimerase/ManNAc kinase, whereas various kinases showed homologies to the C-terminal region of this eukaryotic bifunctional enzyme. Two strategies of enzyme evolution have been described (32Babbitt P.C. Gerlt J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30591-30594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). First, there are structurally related enzymes that catalyze identical reactions with possible differences in substrate specificity. For example, all members of the serine protease superfamily are known to catalyze the same chemistry, although their substrate specificity varied. Also, the sugar kinase superfamily seems to fit with this evolution type. In contrast, there are enzyme superfamilies whose members share a common structural scaffold but catalyze different overall reactions. These enzyme superfamilies probably evolved by incorporation of new catalytic groups within an active site, whereas groups necessary to catalyze the partial reactions common to all of them were retained. One might speculate that the prokaryotic and the eukaryotic UDP-GlcNAc 2-epimerases represent an example of the second evolution type. Prokaryotic and eukaryotic UDP-GlcNAc 2-epimerases do not catalyze identical reactions, but they show the same substrate specificity and share a common intermediate, so they probably employ similar mechanistic strategies. Based on the above-mentioned sequence similarities, site-directed mutagenesis was performed on five conserved histidines in the N-terminal half of the enzyme. Surprisingly, all five mutants lost their epimerase activity. By contrast, the kinase activity was retained, giving a first hint for the existence of two active sites for each reaction working quite independently. To distinguish between general influences on the structural scaffold and specific involvement in the catalytic reaction we investigated whether the histidine mutants were still able to associate as a hexamer, as observed for the wild-type enzyme. The data obtained are consistent with the model shown in Fig. 10. The histidines His-155 and His-157 might be localized within the enzyme dimerization recognition site (33Traut T.W. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1994; 29: 125-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Mutation of histidine to alanine leads to a strongly reduced dimer association constant, which is why mainly trimeric protein is found in place of hexameric protein (Fig. 9,Type III). This result is in contrast to the former view, that the kinase active site assembles as a dimer, based on the detection of active kinase dimer, trimer, and hexamer. Therefore, dimerization is not necessary for the formation of the active site, but oligomerization in general may have a positive cooperativity effect. The previously determined Hill coefficients for ManNAc and ATP are consistent with this proposal, as they are greater for the hexameric enzyme than for the dimeric one (8Hinderlich S. Stäsche R. Zeitler R. Reutter W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24313-24318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Furthermore, not only trimerization of the dimer seems to be essential for epimerase activity, but dimerization itself is also essential, because the trimers show no epimerase activity, although even the small amount of detected hexamer showed no epimerase activity. Thus these mutations seem to influence both enzyme oligomerization and the epimerase activity of the hexameric protein. The mutation of His-110 and His-132 leads qualitatively to the same effect on enzyme oligomerization (Fig. 9, Type II). As the effect is clearly less drastic, one can conclude that these residues are at a position less sensitive for structural transformation, for example at the edge of the dimerization recognition site. Determination of the oligomeric state of the mutants H155A, H157A, H110A, and H132A revealed that they are significantly structurally disturbed. Therefore the loss of epimerase activity can be attributed to this structural perturbation, whereas there is no evidence for a direct involvement in catalysis. On the other hand, the mutant H45A assembles as a hexamer with apparent structural integrity. Since the fully hexameric mutant H45A has no observable epimerase activity, one might speculate that this residue is located in the active site and might be involved in the chemical reaction. In the C-terminal half of the enzyme two amino acid residues within the phosphate 1 motif common to different families of ATP-binding proteins were transformed. The mutated residues Asp-413 and Arg-420 of UDP-GlcNAc 2-epimerase/ManNAc kinase are well conserved within sugar kinases and phosphotransferases (27Bork P. Sander C. Valencia A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7290-7294Crossref PubMed Scopus (701) Google Scholar). Results of molecular modeling and site-directed mutagenesis of human brain hexokinase suggested the interaction of these residues with the tripolyphosphoryl portion of ATP (30Zeng C. Aleshin A.E. Hardie J.B. Harrison R.W. Fromm H.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13157-13164Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In this enzyme, phosphorylation is promoted in the classical way by using the binding energy for the stabilization of the transition state. We could show that site-directed mutagenesis of these conserved residues in the UDP-GlcNAc 2-epimerase/ManNAc kinase results in a drastic loss of kinase activity with no significant effect on epimerase activity. All three mutants show a functionally intact allosteric binding site for CMP-Neu5Ac. Site-directed mutagenesis does not influence the oligomerization process, as all mutants form hexamers. In brief, all parameters investigated correspond to those found for the recombinant wild-type enzyme, apart from the loss of phosphorylation capacity. We conclude that also in the bifunctional enzyme UDP-GlcNAc 2-epimerase/ManNAc kinase these conserved residues play a crucial role in the phosphorylation process. Furthermore it is quite probable that UDP-GlcNAc 2-epimerase/ManNAc kinase provides a structural scaffold for phosphorylation similar to that of the related sugar kinases. Taken together the results of sequence analysis as well as those of site-directed mutagenesis suggest that the bifunctional enzyme is composed of two catalytic domains. The epimerase active site seems to be localized in the N terminus, whereas the kinase active site seems to be in the C terminus of the protein. Construction of deletion mutants would make it possible to determine whether these postulated domains can be expressed separately while retaining their respective activity. We thank Dr. T. A. Scott for improving the English style of the manuscript."
https://openalex.org/W2093716349,"Nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) is a transcription factor that controls the expression of many cellular and viral genes. The p65 (RelA) subunit plays a critical role as a transcriptional activator and recent observations have highlighted its role in the control of apoptosis. Here we report that 53BP2, a protein previously identified by interaction with wild type p53 and Bcl-2, also binds to p65 in a yeast two-hybrid system. This specific interaction was confirmed by pull-down assay in vitro and by a mammalian two-hybrid assay in vivo. We observed that full-length 53BP2 fused to GFP had a punctate distribution in cytoplasm, predominantly in perinuclear region whereas the N-terminal 53BP2 localized in cytoplasm and C-terminal 53BP2 localized in the nucleus. Furthermore, we found that overexpression of GFP-53BP2 induced apoptosis in transiently transfected cells. Neither the N-terminal nor the C-terminal of 53BP2 fused to GFP induced cell death. Interestingly, co-transfection with a p65 expression plasmid significantly inhibited 53BP2-induced cell death. The previous findings that 53BP2 bound to p53 and Bcl-2 together with our present observations suggest that 53BP2 may play a central role in the regulation of apoptosis and cell growth."
https://openalex.org/W1993308590,"Smads form a recently identified family of proteins that mediate intracellular signaling of the transforming growth factor (TGF)-β superfamily.

TGF-βs, activins, bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs), and other ligands belonging to this family govern the fate of cells of a variety of origins. TGF-β-related factors regulate cell proliferation, differentiation, adhesion, migration, and apoptosis through transcriptional regulation of a diverse array of genes such as cell cycle regulators, adhesion molecules, cytokines, transcription factors, and as yet unidentified targets. Receptors for the TGF-β superfamily members are transmembrane serine-threonine kinases classified into two distinct groups, termed type I and type II. Type II receptors are constitutively active kinases, whereas type I receptors are dormant without stimulation. Upon ligand binding, type II receptors phosphorylate type I receptors at the juxtamembrane region. The activated type I receptors, in turn, phosphorylate intracellular signaling mediators with a generic name of Smad. transforming growth factor-β Smad interaction domain bone morphogenetic protein receptor-regulated Smad common mediator Smad antagonistic Smad Decapentaplegic plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 TGF-β type I receptor retinoblastoma transforming growth factor-β Smad interaction domain bone morphogenetic protein receptor-regulated Smad common mediator Smad antagonistic Smad Decapentaplegic plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 TGF-β type I receptor retinoblastoma Smads are classified into three groups depending on the role in signaling: receptor-regulated Smads (R-Smads), common mediator Smads (Co-Smads), and antagonistic Smads (Anti-Smads) (2Heldin C.-H. Miyazono K. ten Dijke P. Nature. 1997; 390: 465-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (3342) Google Scholar, 3Massagué J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 753-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (3985) Google Scholar). R-Smads are direct substrates of the type I receptor kinases. R-Smads exist as monomers in the absence of ligand stimulation (4Kawabata M. Inoue H. Hanyu A. Imamura T. Miyazono K. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4056-4065Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Activated type I receptors phosphorylate R-Smads at the C-terminal SSXS motif containing three serines, the last two of which serve as direct phosphorylation sites. R-Smads then form complexes with Co-Smads. The heteromeric oligomers translocate from the cytoplasm to the nucleus where they act as transcriptional regulators. Anti-Smads stably bind to the receptors, thereby interfering with the phosphorylation of R-Smads. The expression of Anti-Smads are induced by ligands, and Smads thus form an autoregulatory feedback loop inside the cell. Among R-Smads, Smads 2 and 3 respond to TGF-β/activin stimulation, whereas Smads 1, 5, and 8 mediate BMP signals. While Smad4 is the only Co-Smad identified so far in mammals, two Co-Smads were recently found inXenopus (5Masuyama N. Hanafusa H. Kusakabe M. Shibuya H. Nishida E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12163-12170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Smads 6 and 7 belong to Anti-Smads. InDrosophila, Mad responds to Decapentaplegic (Dpp), a BMP-like ligand, whereas dSmad2 propagates TGF-β/activin-like signals (6Brummel T. Abdollah S. Haerry T.E. Shimell M.J. Merriam J. Raftery L.

Genes Cells. 1999; 4: 123-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Medea is a Co-Smad, and Dad is an Anti-Smad. Signaling by the three classes of Smads is conserved in Drosophila(8Inoue H. Imamura T. Ishidou Y. Takase M. Udagawa Y. Oka Y. Tsuneizumi K. Tabata T. Miyazono K. Kawabata M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 2145-2156Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). R-Smads and Co-Smads share two conserved regions denoted the N-terminal MH1 and C-terminal MH2 domains. The MH1 and MH2 domains are tied by a linker region that is variable in the amino acid sequence. Anti-Smads contain the MH2 region, but their N-terminal regions are significantly diverged from the conserved MH1 region. R-Smads and Co-Smads directly bind to DNA through the MH1 domain. The MH2 region is the effector domain that has intrinsic transactivation activity. MH2 also mediates protein-protein association, including Smad-receptor, Smad-Smad, and Smad-nuclear protein interactions. Growth factors or Ras modulate the intracellular localization of R-Smads by phosphorylating the linker region through the mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade (9Kretzschmar M. Doody J. Massagué J. Nature. 1997; 389: 618-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (772) Google Scholar,10Kretzschmar M. Doody J. Timokhina I. Massagué J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 804-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (851) Google Scholar). Interaction of Smads with nuclear proteins is likely to form the basis of transcriptional regulation by members of the TGF-β superfamily. FAST-1 was isolated as a transcription factor that binds to the activin-responsive element in the Mix.2 promoter inXenopus (11Chen X. Rubock M.J. Whitman M. Nature. 1996; 383: 691-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar). Activin-induced complex formation of FAST-1, Smad2, and Smad4 is required for the induction of the Mix.2expression. AP-1 interacts with Smad3 and synergistically activates the expression of the human collagenase I gene (12Zhang Y. Feng X.-H. Derynck R. Nature. 1998; 394: 909-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar). TGF-β induces the expression of the plasminogen inhibitor-1(PAI-1) gene, and AP-1 (12Zhang Y. Feng X.-H. Derynck R. Nature. 1998; 394: 909-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar) and TFE3 (13Hua X. Liu X. Ansari D.O. Lodish H.F. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3084-3095Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar) have been implicated in the induction, although the direct interaction of the latter with Smads has not been shown. Functional interaction of Smads with Sp1 has been reported (14Moustakas A. Kardassis D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6733-6738Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). Smad3, on the other hand, binds to vitamin D receptor through the MH1 domain and acts as a transcriptional coactivator (15Yanagisawa J. Yanagi Y. Masuhiro Y. Suzawa M. Watanabe M. Kashiwagi K. Toriyabe T. Kawabata M. Miyazono K. Kato S. Science. 1999; 283: 1317-1321Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). Several Smad binding motifs on DNA have been revealed. Screening of oligonucleotides by polymerase chain reaction-gel shift selection resulted in the identification of a palindromic sequence of GTCTAGAC as the consensus binding motif for Smad3 and Smad4 (16Zawel L. Dai J.L. Buckhaults P. Zhou S. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Kern S.E. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 611-617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (890) Google Scholar). Examination of the PAI-1 gene resulted in the identification of “CAGA box” as a sequence motif that binds Smads (17Dennler S. Itoh S. Vivien D. ten Dijke P. Huet S. Gauthier J.-M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3091-3100Crossref PubMed Scopus (1580) Google Scholar). An almost identical sequence was found as a Smad binding site in the junBpromoter (18Jonk L.J. Itoh S. Heldin C.-H. ten Dijke P. Kruijer W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21145-21152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). Dpp induces the expression of various genes such asvestigial, and examination of various Dpp-responsive genes revealed GCCGnCGC as a Mad binding sequence. A similar sequence was found to recruit Mad and Medea from the analysis of a Dpp-responsive enhancer in tinman (19Xu X. Yin Z. Hudson J.B. Ferguson E.L. Frasch M. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2354-2370Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). An important indication deduced from the observations described above is that the DNA binding affinity of Smads may be relatively low and the binding specificity may not be rigid. Other sequence-specific DNA binding factors are likely to be required for the tight and specific Smad-DNA interaction in vivo (20Derynck R. Zhang Y. Feng X.-H. Cell. 1998; 95: 737-740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (951) Google Scholar). Transcriptional coactivators such as p300 and CBP possess the histone acetyltransferase activity that loosens the condensed structure of chromatin and promotes the accessibility of transactivation machinery to target DNA (21Giles R.H. Peters D.J. Breuning M.H. Trends Genet. 1998; 14: 178-183Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). p300/CBP also directly interacts with RNA polymerase II in the basal transcription machinery. It has been shown that p300/CBP interacts with mammalian Smads and enhances transactivation by TGF-β (22Janknecht R. Wells N.J. Hunter T.

EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1630-1641Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). p300 also bridges Smad1 and STAT3, thereby converging two distinct signaling pathways of BMP-2 and LIF (28Nakashima K. Yanagisawa M. Arakawa H. Kimura N. Hisatsune T. Kawabata M. Miyazono K. Taga T. Science. 1999; 284: 479-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (726) Google Scholar). E1A, an adenoviral oncoprotein, interacts with p300 or CBP and directly inhibits the histone acetyltransferase activity (29Chakravarti D. Ogryzko V. Kao H.Y. Nash A. Chen H. Nakatani Y. Evans R.M. Cell. 1999; 96: 393-403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Here we determined the Smad interaction domain in p300 and have found that two adjacent regions are required for efficient association of the two proteins. One of them is the C/H3 domain, highly conserved between p300 and CBP, which binds E1A. The other domain is significantly diverged in the primary amino acid sequence between p300 and CBP. E1A interferes with the interaction between p300 and Smad3, but, the interaction of Smad3 with p300 lacking the E1A binding domain was also inhibited by E1A. We then found that E1A interacts with Smads, which seems to cause the inhibition of the p300-Smad interaction. E1A is thus likely to block TGF-β signaling by directly inhibiting the activity of Smad proteins. The construction of the expression plasmids of the wild type p300 and deletion mutant containing amino acids 1737–2414 was described previously (25Nishihara A. Hanai J. Okamoto N. Yanagisawa J. Kato S. Miyazono K. Kawabata M.

The p300 fragments were subcloned into pJG4–5 (see below), FLAG-pcDNA3, or pcDEF3. p300 deletion mutants shown in Fig. 1 B were made using polymerase chain reaction. The sequences of the primers are available upon request. The two-hybrid plasmids of mouse CBP were constructed in a similar manner. The internal EcoRI andXhoI sites were first removed, and N-terminalEcoRI and C-terminal XhoI sites were added, and the resulting fragments were subcloned into pJG4–5. The constructions of the other plasmids were described elsewhere (4Kawabata M. Inoue H. Hanyu A. Imamura T. Miyazono K.

Kawabata M. Genes Cells. 1998; 3: 613-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Briefly, EGY48, the host yeast strain, was transformed with combinations of the reporter (pSH18–34), a bait (pEG202 or Smad3 in pEG202), and a prey (pJG4–5 or p300 in pJG4–5). Yeast was selected on appropriate growth media and then three independent colonies were assayed for the β-galactosidase activity on 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl β-d-galactopyranoside (X-gal) plates. COS-7 cells were used for the detection of protein-protein interaction in vivo. Cells were transfected with an appropriate combination of expression plasmids, washed, scraped, and solubilized in a buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% deoxycholate, 1% aprotinin, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Lysates were cleared and incubated with anti-FLAG M2 antibody (Sigma) or anti-E1A M73 antibody (Santa Cruz), followed by incubation with protein G-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The beads were washed with solubilization buffer without deoxycholate, and the immunoprecipitates were eluted by boiling for 3 min in SDS sample buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.8, 0.01% bromphenol blue, 36% glycerol, 4% SDS) containing 10 mm dithiothreitol and subjected to SDS-gel electrophoresis. Proteins were electrotransferred to nitrocellulose filters, immunoblotted with anti-Myc 9E10 antibody, anti-E1A M73 antibody, or anti-FLAG M2 antibody. The bands were detected using the enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Some of the lysates were directly subjected to Western blotting without immunoprecipitation. Luciferase assays were carried out using the p3TP-Lux reporter (30Cárcamo J. Zentella A. Massagué J.

Cells were transiently transfected with an appropriate combination of the reporter, expression plasmids, and pcDNA3 using FuGENE 6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Total amounts of the transfected DNA were the same throughout the experiments, and luciferase activities were normalized using the sea-pansy luciferase activity under the control of the thymidine kinase promoter (25Nishihara A. Hanai J. Okamoto N. Yanagisawa J. Kato S. Miyazono K. Kawabata M. Genes Cells. 1998; 3: 613-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Lysates of transfected COS-7 cells were precleared with streptavidin-agarose (Sigma) and then incubated with 30 pmol of biotinylated double-stranded oligonucleotides and 12 μg of poly(dI-dC) for overnight at 4 °C. DNA-bound proteins were precipitated with streptavidin-agarose for 30 min at 4 °C, washed, and detected by Western blotting. The sequences of the 3xCAGA probe are: 5′-TCGAGAGCCAGACAAGGAGCCAGACAAGGAGCCAGACACTCGAG-3′ (sense strand) and 5′-CTCGAGTGTCTGGCTCCTTGTCTGGCTCCTTGTCTGGCTCTCGA-3′ (antisense strand). The sense strand was biotinylated at the 5′-end (31Kricka L.J. Nonisotopic DNA Probe Techniques. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1992Google Scholar). In our previous report (25Nishihara A. Hanai J. Okamoto N. Yanagisawa J. Kato S. Miyazono K. Kawabata M. Genes Cells. 1998; 3: 613-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), we identified the C-terminal region (amino acids 1737–2414) of p300 as the Smad-interacting region (Fig.1 A). This region interacted with Smad3 both in the yeast two-hybrid assay and in vivo. In the present study, we made an additional series of p300 deletion mutants and tested the interaction in the two-hybrid assay. The intensity of the interaction of each mutant is summarized in Fig.1 A. Amino acids 2247–2414 are dispensable because DEL-1 interacted with Smad3 as efficiently as the full-length p300. However, further C-terminal deletion (DEL-2 and DEL-3) progressively diminished the interaction. DEL-4 did not interact with Smad3 at all, whereas DEL-5 showed weak binding. We then tested three deletion mutants (DEL-6, -7, and -8) and found that DEL-8 interacts with Smad3 as efficiently as p300 (1737–2414). DEL-9 that overlaps with the C/H3 domain conserved between p300 and CBP did not interact with Smad3 in yeast. Most part of DEL-8 is not conserved between p300 and CBP (Fig.1 B). Therefore, we tested several CBP deletion mutants and found that CBP/DEL-3 corresponding to part of DEL-8 also interacts with Smad3. We then tried to determine the minimal requirement of the interaction. DEL-10 is almost identical to DEL-8, lacking only a short stretch of the C-terminal part, and interacted with Smad3 as well. Within the amino acid sequence of DEL-10, several clusters of amino acids are conserved between p300 and CBP. We mutated these residues to alanines (DEL-11-1 to DEL-11-4), but none of the mutations disrupted the interaction. DEL-13 lacking the N-terminal conserved region of DEL-10 still interacted with Smad3. However, two internal deletions within DEL-13 (DEL-14 and -15) abrogated the interaction. DEL-16 (amino acids 1884–1975) interacted with Smad3 as efficiently as the full-length p300. N-terminal deletion of DEL-13 (DEL-17) diminished the interaction, whereas N-terminal deletion of DEL-16 (DEL-18) lost the interaction. We made an internal deletion mutant of p300 missing the protein sequence of DEL-13 (DEL-19), and this mutant did not interact with Smad3. Taken together, we concluded that the region of DEL-13 is the Smad-interacting domain determined by the two-hybrid assay. We next tested the interaction in vivo using COS cells. p300 (1737–2414) was used as a positive control, which interacted with Smad3 in a ligand-dependent manner (Fig. 2 A). As shown in the yeast assay, C-terminal deletion of the mutant p300 (1737–2414) progressively decreased the interaction (DEL-1 to -3). DEL-4 or -5 did not efficiently interact with Smad3 in vivo in consistent with the result of the yeast assay. In contrast to the two-hybrid assay, however, DEL-7 interacted with Smad3, much less efficiently than p300 (1737–2414) or DEL-1 in vivo, suggesting that a region N-terminal to DEL-7 may contribute to the interaction in vivo. We compared three mutants for the interaction with Smad3 (Fig. 2 B). DEL-8 and DEL-9 interacted with Smad3, but DEL-2 containing the combined region of DEL-8 and DEL-9 interacted much more efficiently. We thus refer the regions of DEL-9, DEL-8, and DEL-2 to Smad-interacting domain-1 (SID-1), SID-2, and SID, respectively (Fig.1 A). SID-1 overlaps with the C/H3 domain, whereas SID-2 contains a nonconserved region between p300 and CBP. SID-1 and SID-2 synergistically contribute to the interaction of p300 with Smad3in vivo. Feng et al. (23Feng X.-H. Zhang Y. Wu R.-Y. Derynck R. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2153-2163Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar) showed that p300 is involved in the DNA binding complex of Smad3 and Smad4 using the PAI-1 promoter. We utilized the CAGA sequence previously shown to bind Smads (17Dennler S. Itoh S. Vivien D. ten Dijke P. Huet S. Gauthier J.-M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3091-3100Crossref PubMed Scopus (1580) Google Scholar). Biotinylated CAGA oligonucleotides were mixed with lysates of COS cells transfected with various combinations of expression plasmids and subjected to purification using streptavidin beads (Fig. 3). A relatively low level of Smad3 bound to the CAGA sequence in the absence of the constitutively active form of TGF-β type I receptor, TβR-I(TD), whereas p300 alone did not bind to CAGA at all. TGF-β stimulation greatly increased the binding of Smad3 to CAGA, and cotransfection of Smad3 and p300 revealed that p300 is incorporated in the Smad3 DNA binding complex. We showed previously that p300 (1737–2414) containing SID, but lacking the histone acetyltransferase domain, suppressed transcriptional activation by TGF-β in a dominant-negative manner (25Nishihara A. Hanai J. Okamoto N. Yanagisawa J. Kato S. Miyazono K. Kawabata M. Genes Cells. 1998; 3: 613-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The effect of various p300 deletion mutants on TGF-β-induced transactivation was studied in a luciferase assay using the p3TP-Lux reporter (30Cárcamo J. Zentella A. Massagué J. Mol. Cell Biol. 1995; 15: 1573-1581Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig.4 A). TβR-I(TD) stimulated the activity of p3TP-Lux, and DEL-1 suppressed the activation. p300 (1737–2414) and DEL-1 showed similar dominant-negative effects (data not shown). In accordance with the result of the two-hybrid assay (Fig.1 A), C-terminal deletion of DEL-1 (DEL-2 and -3) mitigated the suppression. DEL-7 and DEL-8/SID-2 also suppressed the transactivation of the reporter. DEL-4 that does not interact with p300 either in the two-hybrid assay or in vivo did not suppress the transactivation at all. In contrast, DEL-9/SID-1 rather enhanced the activity of the reporter. The C/H3 domain contained in DEL-9/SID-1 interacts not only with Smad3 but with various proteins including E1A, which may complicate the result. DEL-9/SID-1 might inhibit the transcriptional repression activity of cellular E1A-like protein. Wild type p300 enhanced the transactivation of p3TP-Lux by TGF-β, whereas DEL-1 and DEL-7 inhibited the reporter activity in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 4 B). The suppression of the TGF-β-induced p3TP-Lux activation by DEL-8/SID-2 and DEL-7 containing SID-2 provides another evidence that p300 contributes to transcriptional activation by TGF-β. E1A interferes with the transactivation by TGF-β (22Janknecht R. Wells N.J. Hunter T. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2114-2119Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar, 23Feng X.-H. Zhang Y. Wu R.-Y.

Chem. 1998; 273: 22865-22868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). We studied the effect of E1A on the Smad3-p300 interaction in the presence of TβR-I(TD) (Fig.5 A). E1A potently inhibited the interaction of Smad3 with the wild type p300 as well as with p300 (1737–2414). The interaction of E1A with the C/H3 domain in p300 may competitively inhibit the Smad3-p300 interaction. However, the interaction of Smad3 with DEL-8/SID-2 lacking the C/H3 domain was also inhibited by E1A. We tested the interaction of E1A with p300 (Fig.5 B). As reported previously, E1A interacted with the wild type p300 and p300 (1737–2414) containing the C/H3 domain. In contrast, E1A failed to interact with DEL-8/SID-2. These results prompted us to investigate the possibility of the association of E1A with Smad3. E1A interacted with Smad3 both in the absence and presence of TGF-β stimulation (Fig. 6 A). The E1A interaction domain in Smad3 was determined using various Smad3 deletion mutants (Fig. 6 B). The MH1 domain did not interact with E1A, whereas the MH2 domain strongly interacted with E1A. The linker region is not likely to interact with E1A because MH1+Linker did not interact with E1A. We next tested the interaction of E1A with various species of Smads (Fig. 6 C). E1A interacted with Smad1, Smad2, and Smad3, but not with Smad4 or Smad6. Thus E1A specifically interacts with R-Smads, but not with Co-Smads or Anti-Smads. These results suggest that at least one of the mechanisms of the inhibition of the Smad3-p300 interaction by E1A is likely to be the direct association of E1A with Smad3. The recent identification of the Smad family proteins has enabled the investigation of the molecular mechanism of transcriptional regulation by members of the TGF-β superfamily. Janknecht et al. (22Janknecht R. Wells N.J. Hunter T. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2114-2119Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar) identified Smad3 as a CBP interacting protein using the two-hybrid screen. Smad4 with a C-terminal deletion of 42 amino acids also interacted with p300, whereas the full-length Smad4 did not interact. The Smad-interacting domain in CBP determined in GST pull-down assays was 285 amino acids from 1891 to 2175. The corresponding region in p300 is amino acids 1855–2171. The Smad-interacting domain reduced TGF-β-induced transactivation. Fenget al. (23Feng X.-H. Zhang Y. Wu R.-Y. Derynck R. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2153-2163Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar) identified two Smad-interacting domains in CBP using the mammalian two-hybrid assay. One is a low affinity domain (amino acids 1–451), and the other is a high affinity domain (amino acids 1891–2441). We also observed weak interaction between Smad1 and the N-terminal part of p300 (amino acids 1–1030) in vivo(28Nakashima K. Yanagisawa M. Arakawa H. Kimura N. Hisatsune T. Kawabata M. Miyazono K. Taga T. Science. 1999; 284: 479-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (726) Google Scholar). From the combination of the results of the yeast two-hybrid assay, Feng et al. (23Feng X.-H. Zhang Y. Wu R.-Y. Derynck R. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2153-2163Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar) concluded that the Smad-interacting domain in CBP is amino acids 1891–1991, although they did not show the direct interaction of the region with Smad3. The corresponding region in p300 is amino acids 1855–1960. Topper et al. (24Topper J.N. DiChiara M.R. Brown J.D. Williams A.J. Falb D. Collins T. Gimbrone Jr., M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9506-9511Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) also reported that the C-terminal region of CBP (amino acids 1892–2441) interacts with Smad2 and Smad4 using the mammalian two-hybrid assay. The interaction of Smad4 with CBP was TGF-β dependent, suggesting that Smad4 may interact with CBP via endogenous R-Smads (23Feng X.-H. Zhang Y. Wu R.-Y. Derynck R. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2153-2163Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). Shenet al. (26Shen X. Hu P.P. Liberati N.T. Datto M.B. Frederick J.P. Wang X.-F. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 3309-3319Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar) identified amino acids 1572–2414 in p300 as a Smad-interacting domain using GST pull-down assays. Waltzer and Bienz (27Waltzer L. Bienz M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1630-1641Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) identified amino acids 2413–2608 in Drosophila CBP as a minimal region required for Mad binding using GST pull-down assays. The corresponding region in p300 is amino acids 1741–1933. They observed that amino acids 2240 to 2507 of Drosophila CBP (amino acids 1675–1843 in p300) interacts with Mad in one of the GST pull-down assays, but not in the yeast two-hybrid assay. This region contains the C/H3 domain, but not SID-2 determined in our assay. We identified two adjacent regions required for p300 to interact with Smad3. SID-1 overlaps with the C/H3 domain conserved between p300 and CBP, and SID-2 contains a nonconserved region between the two coactivators. DEL-7 and DEL-8 that strongly interacted with Smad3 in the two-hybrid assay did not efficiently bind to Smad3 in vivo. Furthermore, DEL-9/SID-1 did not show interaction in the yeast assay. This apparent discrepancy could have been caused by the fusion of a relatively large protein moiety containing a transactivation domain to the p300 deletion mutants, which may alter the structure of the N-terminal SID-1 portion of the p300 prey proteins. SID-2 in CBP mediates the interaction of CBP with Smad3 because one of the CBP deletion mutants, CBP/DEL-3, interacted with Smad3 in the two-hybrid assay (Fig. 1 B). We showed that the p300-Smad3 interaction in vivo is augmented in a synergistic manner when both SID-1 and SID-2 are present (Fig. 2 B). As the primary amino acid sequence of SID-2 is not conserved between p300 and CBP, three-dimensional conformation of this region may be conserved between the two proteins. We showed that p300 is incorporated in the DNA binding complex of Smad3 using the TGF-β-responsive CAGA sequence (Fig. 3). In our previous study (25Nishihara A. Hanai J. Okamoto N. Yanagisawa J. Kato S. Miyazono K. Kawabata M. Genes Cells. 1998; 3: 613-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), we showed that p300 augments the transactivation of the p3TP-Lux reporter by TGF-β, and the p300 (1737–2414) containing SID suppresses the activation in a dominant-negative manner. In the present study, DEL-7 containing SID-2 and the following C-terminal sequence inhibited TGF-β-induced transactivation most potently (Fig.4 A). As the progressive C-terminal deletion of DEL-1 diminished the dominant-negative action of DEL-1, not only SID-2 but its C-terminal following sequence may contribute to the suppression. It should be noted that the C-terminal part of DEL-2 is identical with that of DEL-8/SID-2. In contrast, DEL-9/SID-1 rather enhanced the transactivation by TGF-β. The C/H3 domain has been shown to interact with various proteins including E1A. One of the explanations for the unexpected result is that DEL-9/SID-1 may sequester endogenous E1A-like proteins and relieves p300 from the transcriptional repression by the protein. This effect may have caused DEL-7 to be a more potent dominant-negative suppressor of TGF-β activity than DEL-2/SID. E1A has been shown to antagonize TGF-β signaling in various systems. TGF-β down-regulates c-myc expression, and E1A blocks the down-regulation (33Pietenpol J.A. Stein R.W. Moran E. Yaciuk P. Schlegel R. Lyons R.M. Pittelkow M.R. Münger K. Howley P.M. Moses H.L. Cell. 1990; 61: 777-785Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar). The retinoblastoma (Rb) binding domain in E1A was shown to be essential to this effect. E1A renders cells resistant to growth inhibition by TGF-β. Missero et al. (34Missero C. Filvaroff E. Dotto G.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3489-3493Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) showed that both Rb binding domain and p300 binding domain in E1A are required for the full suppression of TGF-β-induced growth arrest. TGF-β represses the expression of the Cdc2 kinase, which is abrogated by the wild type E1A or a mutant E1A defective for Rb binding (35Abraham S.E. Carter M.C. Moran E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 655-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The expression of junB is induced by TGF-β, phorbol ester, and serum, and E1A selectively inhibits the induction by TGF-β, but not by phorbol ester or serum (36Coussens L.M. Yokoyama K. Chiu R. J. Cell. Physiol. 1994; 160: 435-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). de Groot et al. (37de Groot R.P. Kranenburg O. de Wit L. van den Eijnden-van Raaij J. Mummery C. van der Eb A.J. Zantema A. Cell Growth Differ. 1995; 6: 531-540PubMed Google Scholar) showed that E1A antagonizes both growth stimulatory and inhibitory effects of TGF-β. p15 and p21 Cdk inhibitors mediate at least part of TGF-β-induced cell growth arrest. E1A inhibits the induction of p15 and p21 by TGF-β, and the inhibition depends on E1A's ability to bind p300 (38Datto M.B. Hu P.P. Kowalik T.F. Yingling J. Wang X.-F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2030-2037Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These observations argue that proteins that interact with E1A play important roles in TGF-β signaling. E1A binds to Rb and p300/CBP. The mechanisms proposed to date whereby E1A antagonizes TGF-β can thus be summarized as 1) Rb-dependent and 2) p300/CBP-dependent ones. 1) Rb is a potent growth suppressor, and inactivation of Rb is required for cell cycle progression. Phosphorylation of Rb by the Cdk kinases relieves E2Fs that induce the expression of genes required for the G1/S transition. DNA tumor viral oncoproteins such as E1A, SV40 large T antigen, and HPV E7 sequester and inactivate Rb, thereby disrupting the major cellular growth control, eventually leading to tumorigenesis. Growth arrest by TGF-β is dependent on Rb and interfered with by direct binding of E1A to Rb (33Pietenpol J.A. Stein R.W. Moran E. Yaciuk P. Schlegel R. Lyons R.M. Pittelkow M.R. Münger K.

Cell Growth Differ. 1995; 6: 531-540PubMed Google Scholar). 2) TGF-β down-regulates the expression of positive cell cycle regulators such as c-myc and Cdc25A and transactivates negative cell cycle regulators such as p15 and p21 cdk inhibitors. E1A suppresses the induction of p15 and p21, which is dependent on p300 (38Datto M.B. Hu P.P. Kowalik T.F. Yingling J. Wang X.-F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2030-2037Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In Wnt signaling, CBP was shown to act as a transcriptional repressor by competing with β-catenin in binding to TCF, a transcription factor activated by Wnt (39Waltzer L. Bienz M. Nature. 1998; 395: 521-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). p300/CBP may thus play a role in the down-regulation of c-myc or cdc25Aand could be a target of E1A in transcriptional repression as well. In the present report, we propose the third mechanism of the E1A antagonization of TGF-β signaling. We demonstrated that E1A associates with Smad3 and inhibits the interaction of Smad3 and p300. Therefore, E1A may directly inhibit TGF-β signaling by binding to the signaling mediators of TGF-β. We thank R. Eckner for human p300, R. Goodman for mouse CBP, M. Ikeda for E1A, R.

Several triadin isoforms have been postulated to exist in cardiac muscle, but to date none has been conclusively identified. Here, we show that only triadin 1 is significantly expressed. We cloned and sequenced cDNAs encoding canine cardiac triadin 1 and 3 but found no evidence for triadin 2. From deduced primary structures, antibodies against domains common to all triadins and an antibody against the unique C terminus of triadin 1 were raised. All antibodies detected two prominent proteins of molecular masses 35 and 40 kDa on immunoblots from cardiac microsomes, including the antibody that recognizes only triadin 1. The 40-kDa mobility form was shown to correspond to the glycosylated form of triadin 1, not a distinct triadin 2 isoform as previously hypothesized. Confirming this, overexpression of triadin 1 in transgenic mouse hearts produced both the 35-kDa deglycosylated and the 40-kDa glycosylated mobility forms. The glycosylation site of triadin 1 was localized to asparagine residue 75, and its bitopic arrangement in the membrane was confirmed. Although a 92-kDa immunoreactive protein could be tentatively identified in myocardium as triadin 3, its expression level was insignificant (≤5%) compared with that of triadin 1.

Both triadin and junctin are integral membrane proteins that may serve to tether calsequestrin to the Ca2+ release channel, thus facilitating the transfer of Ca2+ across the junctional membrane during coupling of excitation to contraction (2Zhang L.

Recent reports suggest that triadin inhibits the activity of the RyR in skeletal muscle by decreasing the open state probability of the channel (10Kuniyasu A. Kawano S. Hirayama Y. Ji Y.H. Xu K.

From this type of evidence, triadin is proposed to have an important regulatory role in the Ca2+ release process as it occurs in both cardiac (2Zhang L. Kelly J. Schmeisser G. Kobayashi Y.M.

Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 7507-7513Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) as a major 95-kDa membrane protein endogenous to skeletal muscle junctional SR membranes. Subsequently, the primary structure of skeletal muscle triadin was deduced from its cDNA sequence by Knudson et al. (8Knudson C.M. Stang K.K. Moomaw C.R. Slaughter C.A. Campbell K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12646-12654Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Only a single triadin isoform was identified in skeletal muscle, which was predicted to be an intrinsic membrane protein containing a single membrane-spanning domain (8Knudson C.M. Stang K.K.

The protein contains a short N terminus located in the cytoplasm, and a large, highly charged C-terminal domain proposed to reside entirely within the lumen of the SR (8Knudson C.M. Stang K.K.

Chem. 1993; 268: 12637-12645Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A glutathione S-transferase fusion protein containing the lumenal domain of triadin was shown to bind directly to calsequestrin and the RyR, providing direct evidence for a physical association between all three proteins (3Guo W. Campbell K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9027-9030Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Conclusive identification of triadin protein(s) in cardiac tissue has proven to be problematical. By using 125I-labeled calsequestrin in overlay assays, Mitchell et al. (7Mitchell R.D. Simmerman H.K.B. Jones L.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 1376-1381Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) identified three major calsequestrin-binding proteins in cardiac junctional SR vesicles of apparent molecular weights of 26,000, 35,000, and 40,000. The 26-kDa calsequestrin-binding protein was recently purified, sequenced, and cloned and named junctin (9Jones L.R. Zhang L. Sanborn K. Jorgensen A.O. Kelly J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30787-30796Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Identical junctins were expressed in cardiac and skeletal muscle (9Jones L.R. Zhang L. Sanborn K. Jorgensen A.O. Kelly J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30787-30796Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar), and like triadin, junctin was demonstrated to bind to both calsequestrin and the RyR (2Zhang L. Kelly J. Schmeisser G. Kobayashi Y.M. Jones L.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23389-23397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). Although the 35- and 40-kDa calsequestrin-binding proteins have been consistently observed in canine cardiac microsomes and excluded from being junctin isoforms (2Zhang L. Kelly J. Schmeisser G. Kobayashi Y.M. Jones L.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23389-23397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar, 7Mitchell R.D. Simmerman H.K.B. Jones L.R. J. Biol.

Chem. 1995; 270: 30787-30796Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar), their exact relationship to triadin or triadin isoforms has remained ambiguous. Recent cloning results utilizing a rabbit heart cDNA library predicted three unique triadin protein isoforms expressed in cardiac muscle, named cardiac triadins 1, 2, and 3 by Guo et al. (4Guo W. Jorgensen A.O. Jones L.R. Campbell K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 458-465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The deduced amino acid sequences of all three cardiac triadins (and skeletal muscle triadin) were identical between amino acid residues 1–264. This shared region included the N-terminal cytoplasmic domains, the transmembrane segments, and the C-terminal, intralumenal domains shown to bind calsequestrin and the RyR. The sequences of the cardiac triadins diverged after amino acid 264 by the inclusion of unique C-terminal tails, giving predicted molecular weights of approximately 32,000, 35,000, and 75,000 for rabbit cardiac triadins 1, 2, and 3, respectively (4Guo W. Jorgensen A.O. Jones L.R. Campbell K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 458-465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). On immunoblots of rabbit cardiac SR vesicles using generic triadin antibodies that did not discriminate between isoforms, three prominent triadin mobility forms were detected with apparent molecular weights of 35,000, 40,000, and 92,000, suggesting that these three immunoreactive bands represented cardiac triadins 1, 2, and 3, respectively, predicted by cDNA cloning (4Guo W. Jorgensen A.O. Jones L.R. Campbell K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 458-465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Consistent with this, the apparent molecular weights of the 35-kDa and 40-kDa calsequestrin-binding proteins in canine cardiac junctional SR vesicles (2Zhang L. Kelly J. Schmeisser G. Kobayashi Y.M. Jones L.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23389-23397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar, 7Mitchell R.D. Simmerman H.K.B. Jones L.R. J. Biol.

Chem. 1995; 270: 30787-30796Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar) also matched very closely with the predicted molecular weights for rabbit cardiac triadins 1 and 2 (4Guo W. Jorgensen A.O. Jones L.R. Campbell K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 458-465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Moreover, purification and partial amino acid sequencing of the 35-kDa calsequestrin-binding protein from dog heart junctional SR vesicles gave several peptide fragments of identical amino acid sequences as regions of the common domains shared by all of the rabbit cardiac triadin isoforms predicted from cDNA cloning (4Guo W. Jorgensen A.O. Jones L.R. Campbell K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 458-465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Based upon all of these observations, it was proposed that three major triadin isoforms indeed existed in heart (4Guo W. Jorgensen A.O. Jones L.R. Campbell K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 458-465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). However, direct identification of the predicted protein isoforms and determination of their relative expression levels still has not been performed. Here, we directly addressed the issue of the identities of the different triadin isoforms expressed in heart. Remarkably, we find that only triadin 1 is expressed to any significant extent in myocardium. We could find no evidence for the existence of triadin 2, and expression of triadin 3, although detected provisionally at the protein level, appears marginal compared with the level demonstrated for triadin 1 in all species examined. Restriction enzymes were purchased from New England Biolabs. Growth media constituents for plasmid propagation inEscherichia coli were purchased from Fisher and Sigma. Library isolates and constructs were sequenced using SequenaseTM (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and sequence was analyzed with MacVectorTM (Oxford Molecular). All oligonucleotides were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. Radioactive nucleotides were obtained from NEN Life Science Products. Oligonucleotides flanking the cDNA sequence encoding the common lumenal region shared by the rabbit triadin isoforms (residues 69–264) were used to PCR-amplify a 588-bp [α-32P]dCTP- and [α-32P]dATP-labeled cDNA probe using rabbit cardiac triadin 1 cDNA as template (4Guo W. Jorgensen A.O. Jones L.R. Campbell K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 458-465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The probe was used to screen a canine cardiac λgt10 cDNA library (5Scott B.T. Simmerman H.K.B. Collins J.H. Nadal-Ginard B. Jones L.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 8958-8964Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Palmer C.J. Scott B.T. Jones L.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11126-11130Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and positive isolates were subcloned into the EcoRI site of pBlueScript II SK (Stratagene). All these isolates displayed a 5′ partial open reading frame encoding triadin. To obtain the full-length protein-coding region, the same probe was used to screen a canine cardiac Lambda Zap Express cDNA library (Stratagene), and positive clones were isolated according to manufacturers' specifications. Triadin 1 and triadin 3 full-length cDNA clones were then assembled using overlapping clones 4c, 5z, and 3b (see Fig. 1 B) after digestion with EcoRI andPflMI and ligating the resulting fragments into pBlueScript SK II. Canine cardiac mRNAs encoding full-length triadins 1 and 3 were confirmed by RT-PCR as follows. Total RNA was isolated from canine left ventricle muscle using RNAgents Total RNA Isolation System (Promega). First strand cDNA was made by using random hexamers and Superscript IITM (Life Technologies, Inc.). PCR was performed using Pfu polymerase (Stratagene) and triadin primers (Fig. 1 B) as follows. Forward primer 1 is a 30-bp primer extending from bp −3 through bp +1 to 27 of the common cDNA sequence of the triadins, which is identical between the canine and rabbit (4Guo W. Jorgensen A.O. Jones L.R. Campbell K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 458-465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) triadins. Reverse primer 2 is a 24-bp primer beginning 46 bp downstream of the canine triadin 1 stop codon in its unique 3′-untranslated region. Primers 1 and 2 in addition contained 5′-engineered EcoRI and BglII restriction enzyme sites, respectively. Reverse primer 3 is a 25-bp primer beginning at the stop codon of canine cardiac triadin 3. Primer 4, corresponding to the antisense cDNA sequence encoding the last 9 amino acids and the stop codon of putative rabbit triadin 2 (4Guo W. Jorgensen A.O. Jones L.R. Campbell K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 458-465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), was labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase (Promega) to generate an oligo probe. This probe was used to screen both above mentioned cardiac cDNA libraries for cardiac triadin 2. In addition, RT-PCR of canine cardiac total RNA was performed using primers 1 and 4 to search for a cardiac cDNA corresponding to triadin 2. To compare the canine cardiac triadin isoforms to their skeletal muscle counterpart, a UniZap canine skeletal muscle cDNA library (Stratagene) was screened using the common 588-bp cDNA probe described above. Positive clones were isolated according to manufacturers' specifications. Clone 2d (Fig. 1) contained the full-length canine skeletal muscle triadin protein-coding region. Asparagine residue 75, the potential glycosylation site conserved in all triadin isoforms, was mutated to an alanine in cardiac triadin 1 to produce an N75A-triadin 1 mutant. The mutated cDNA was generated by PCR of the assembled full-length triadin 1 clone as follows. An N75A sense primer encoding an alanine mutation at asparagine residue 75 and primer 2 (Fig. 1 B) were used to first amplify a mutant product. A second PCR reaction used primers 1 and 2 with 2 μl of the first PCR product mix to amplify the full-length triadin 1 encoding the N75A mutation. The final PCR product carrying the full-length protein coding region for N75A-triadin 1 was ligated into theEcoRI-BglII sites of a baculovirus transfer plasmid and expressed in insect cells. Canine cardiac triadin 1 and N75A-triadin 1 cDNA protein-coding regions were subcloned into theEcoRI-BglII restriction enzyme sites of the baculovirus transfer plasmids pVL1393 and pAcGS2 (Pharmingen), respectively. Transfer vectors were cotransfected with BaculoGoldTM-linearized baculovirus DNA (Pharmingen) into Sf21 insect cells (Invitrogen) according to manufacturers' specifications. Recombinant virus isolation and amplification were performed as described in baculovirus protocols (18O'Reilly D.R. Miller L.K. Luckow V.A. Baculovirus Expression Vectors: A Laboratory Manual. W. H. Freeman & Co., New York1992Google Scholar). Insect cells infected with recombinant baculovirus encoding canine cardiac triadin 1 or N75A-triadin 1 were extracted at pH 11.4 with sodium carbonate to obtain carbonate pellets highly enriched in the recombinant proteins (19Reddy L.G.

Triadins were then solubilized from the carbonate pellets by use of Triton X-100 and purified by phosphocellulose chromatography as described previously (9Jones L.R. Zhang L. Sanborn K. Jorgensen A.O. Kelly J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30787-30796Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Site-specific antibodies were raised in rabbits against synthetic peptides (Genosys Biotechnologies) corresponding to the following regions: the common N terminus (cytoplasmic domain) of cardiac and skeletal muscle triadins of all known species isoforms (residues 2–18, C-TEITAEGNASTTTTVI) (N-term antibody); the common lumenal domain of mouse cardiac and skeletal muscle triadins 2Y. M. Kobayashi and L. R. Jones, unpublished sequence. (residues 146–160, C-QEKAEKEEKPEKKIQ) (lumenal antibody); and the unique C-terminal tail of canine cardiac triadin 1 (residues 262–278, C-EEVAGGSKRTLGKKQIQ) (T1-specific antibody). Peptides with N-terminal cysteines were coupled to ovalbumin using ImjectTM Conjugation Kit (Pierce), and conjugated samples were injected into New Zealand White rabbits for antibody production (2Zhang L.

Jorgensen A.O. Kelly J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30787-30796Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Polyclonal antibodies produced to each peptide were affinity purified from rabbit antiserum using the corresponding peptides cross-linked to SulfolinkTM gel columns (Pierce). In addition, a generic triadin antiserum was raised in rabbits against purified recombinant triadin 1, and antibodies were affinity purified following the method of Olmsted (20Olmsted J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 11955-11957Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Epitopes recognized by the triadin antibodies were mapped to high resolution using cellulose-bound PepSpotsTM (Jerini Bio Tools). The PepSpotsTM sheet contained a series of immobilized 13-mer synthetic peptides, each overlapping by 11 residues, that moved down the length of the primary structure of canine triadin 1. Immunoblotting on PepSpotsTM was done as described below. Procedure I cardiac microsomes (21Jones L.R. Cala S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 11809-11818Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were isolated from the ventricles of dogs, rabbits, mice, rats, humans, and guinea pigs. Subfractionation of Procedure I microsomes from dogs into free and junctional SR vesicles was conducted as described (21Jones L.R. Cala S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 11809-11818Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Skeletal muscle microsomes were isolated from canine hind limb muscle. A protease protection assay was used to determine the topology of cardiac triadin 1 in the SR membrane as described previously for junctin (9Jones L.R. Zhang L. Sanborn K. Jorgensen A.O. Kelly J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30787-30796Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). 50 μg of intact or 0.2% Triton X-100-permeabilized canine cardiac microsomes were treated with 1 μg of trypsin for 30 min at room temperature. SDS-PAGE of microsomes was then conducted, and membrane proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose for incubation with the N-term or T1-specific antibodies. Calsequestrin, an entirely intralumenal protein, was also probed with a polyclonal antibody to canine cardiac calsequestrin (2Zhang L. Kelly J. Schmeisser G. Kobayashi Y.M. Jones L.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23389-23397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar), as a control for vesicle leakiness. 40–50 μg of microsomal protein were dissolved in SDS sample buffer containing 7% SDS plus 80 mm dithiothreitol. Samples were heated at 100 °C for 5 min, then electrophoresed in 8–10% polyacrylamide, and stained with Coomassie Blue or transferred to nitrocellulose (9Jones L.R. Zhang L. Sanborn K. Jorgensen A.O. Kelly J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30787-30796Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Immunoblotting of transferred proteins or PepSpotsTM was conducted as described (2Zhang L. Kelly J. Schmeisser G. Kobayashi Y.M. Jones L.R. J. Biol.

For reprobing the PepSpotsTM sheet with different antibodies, the sheet was erased between antibody applications by washing the filter three times for 1 h at 50 °C in 50 mm Tris (pH 6.7), 2.0% SDS, and 0.1 m β-mercaptoethanol. 125I-Labeled protein bands were quantified using a model GS-250 Molecular ImagerTM (Bio-Rad). The RT-PCR product for the canine cardiac triadin 1 cDNA was ligated into the EcoRI-BamHI restriction enzyme sites of pBlueScript II SK and then digested from pBlueScript II SK withSalI and SacI restriction enzymes to produce two fragments, a 273-bp SalI-SacI fragment containing 3 bp of 5′-untranslated sequences and 234 bp of protein-coding sequence, and a 685-bp SacI-SacI fragment containing the remaining 603 bp of protein-coding sequence followed by 39 bp of 3′-untranslated sequences. Both fragments were subcloned into a mouse cardiac α-myosin heavy chain promoter expression cassette (22Gulick J. Subramaniam A. Neumann J. Robbins J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9180-9185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as used recently for targeted overexpression of calsequestrin to mouse heart (23Jones L.R. Suzuki Y.J. Wang W. Kobayashi Y.M. Ramesh V. Franzini-Armstrong C. Cleemann L. Morad M. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 1385-1393Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). The proper orientation of the triadin 1 restriction fragments in the expression cassette was confirmed by nucleic acid sequencing. Production of transgenic mice and screening was conducted as recently described (23Jones L.R. Suzuki Y.J. Wang W. Kobayashi Y.M. Ramesh V. Franzini-Armstrong C. Cleemann L. Morad M. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 1385-1393Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Triadin 1-overexpressing mice exhibited normal viability into adulthood but developed cardiac hypertrophy with an approximately 60% increase in heart weight. Triadin 1 was overexpressed 9-fold or greater in ventricles from transgenic mice and copurified with cardiac microsomes enriched in sarcoplasmic reticulum. Ventricular myocytes from triadin 1-overexpressing mice exhibited contractile abnormalities, which will be reported in detail elsewhere. 3U. Kirchhefer, H. A. Baba, F. Begrow, U. Reinke, W. Schmitz, N. Schoenhalz, J. Neumann, Y. M., Kobayashi, and L. R. Jones, manuscript in preparation. 50-μg aliquots of cardiac microsomes were added to 40 μl of buffer containing 50 mm MOPS, 3.0 mm MgCl2, 0.1m KCl, 0.1 mm CaCl2, 0.2% Triton X-100, 0.2% SDS, and 50 mm sodium citrate (pH 5.5). Samples were heated at 100 °C for 3 min and then equilibrated to 37 °C. Five milliunits of endo H (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) were added, and deglycosylation was conducted for 30 min at 37 °C. Control incubations were carried out in parallel in the absence of endo H. Reactions were quenched by adding 2 volumes of electrophoresis buffer containing 15% SDS. Samples were then separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose for immunoblotting. 2 μg of purified recombinant triadin 1 and the N27A-triadin 1 mutant were also analyzed. By using a rabbit triadin (4Guo W. Jorgensen A.O. Jones L.R. Campbell K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 458-465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar)-based cDNA probe, λgt10 (5Scott B.T. Simmerman H.K.B. Collins J.H. Nadal-Ginard B. Jones L.R. J. Biol.

Chem. 1991; 266: 11126-11130Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and Lambda Zap Express canine cardiac cDNA libraries were screened. The λgt10 library yielded 50 positive clones, each of which carried a triadin 5′ partial open reading frame. Isolate 4c contained a 720-bp EcoRI fragment, the longest clone, incorporating the 5′-untranslated region, the ATG start codon, and part of the 5′ protein-coding region of triadin through amino acid residues 1–174 (Fig.1 B). The Lambda Zap Express library yielded 15 more positive clones, none of which carried a full-length protein-coding region. However, 13 of these clones contained partial open reading frames encoding the unique C-terminal end of triadin 1. Of these, clone 5z w"
https://openalex.org/W2048571264,"We previously reported the cloning of the thousand and one-amino acid protein kinase 1 (TAO1), a rat homolog of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae protein kinase sterile 20 protein. Here we report the complete sequence and properties of a related rat protein kinase TAO2. Like TAO1, recombinant TAO2 selectively activated mitogen-activated protein/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinases (MEKs) 3, 4, and 6 of the stress-responsive mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways in vitro and copurified with MEK3 endogenous to Sf9 cells. To examine TAO2 interactions with MEKs, the MEK binding domain of TAO2 was localized to an ∼135-residue sequence just C-terminal to the TAO2 catalytic domain. In vitro this MEK binding domain associated with MEKs 3 and 6 but not MEKs 1, 2, or 4. Using chimeric MEK proteins, we found that the MEK N terminus was sufficient for binding to TAO2. Catalytic activity of full-length TAO2 enhanced its binding to MEKs. However, neither the autophosphorylation of the MEK binding domain of TAO2 nor the activity of MEK itself was required for MEK binding. These results suggest that TAO proteins lie in stress-sensitive kinase cascades and define a mechanism by which these kinases may organize downstream targets. We previously reported the cloning of the thousand and one-amino acid protein kinase 1 (TAO1), a rat homolog of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae protein kinase sterile 20 protein. Here we report the complete sequence and properties of a related rat protein kinase TAO2. Like TAO1, recombinant TAO2 selectively activated mitogen-activated protein/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinases (MEKs) 3, 4, and 6 of the stress-responsive mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways in vitro and copurified with MEK3 endogenous to Sf9 cells. To examine TAO2 interactions with MEKs, the MEK binding domain of TAO2 was localized to an ∼135-residue sequence just C-terminal to the TAO2 catalytic domain. In vitro this MEK binding domain associated with MEKs 3 and 6 but not MEKs 1, 2, or 4. Using chimeric MEK proteins, we found that the MEK N terminus was sufficient for binding to TAO2. Catalytic activity of full-length TAO2 enhanced its binding to MEKs. However, neither the autophosphorylation of the MEK binding domain of TAO2 nor the activity of MEK itself was required for MEK binding. These results suggest that TAO proteins lie in stress-sensitive kinase cascades and define a mechanism by which these kinases may organize downstream targets.

Several mammalian protein kinases related to Ste20p have been identified that phosphorylate MAP/ERK kinase (MEK) family members in stress-activated MAP kinase cascades. These include mixed lineage kinases, TGF-β-activated protein kinase, and TAO1 (3Hirai S. Katoh M. Terada M. Kyriakis J.M. Zon L.I. Rana A. Avruch J. Ohno S. J. Biol.

In the yeast protein kinase family tree the Ste20p branch is closest to the MEK kinases (MEKKs) (9Hunter T. Plowman G.D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 18-22Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). Thus, it is not surprising that several mammalian Ste20p-related kinases are MEKKs. Some have selectivity for MEKs in the c-Jun N-terminal kinase/stress-activated protein kinase (JNK/SAPK) pathway and others for the p38 stress-sensitive pathway, whereas most phosphorylate both groups of MEKs in vitro (3Hirai S.

The plethora of Ste20p-like kinases with effects on stress pathways and their overlapping biochemical activities have made it difficult to define their roles in the physiological regulation of these kinase cascades. MEK3 and MEKK1 are almost certainly important for regulation of JNK/SAPKs because they bind to JNK/SAPK and other cascade components either through a scaffold protein, with a function believed to be analogous to the yeast scaffold protein Ste5p (14Burbelo P.D.

Berman K.S. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28625-28632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 18Marcus S. Polverino A. Chang E. Robbins D. Cobb M.H. Wigler M.H.

Chem. 1995; 270: 26067-26070Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Among the mammalian cDNAs, we isolated one that encoded the protein kinase TAO1, named for its one thousand andone amino acids. TAO1 is like certain other relatives of Ste20p in that it phosphorylates and activates MEKs from the stress-responsive MAP kinase cascades. Copurification experiments indicated that TAO1 interacted with MEK3, a p38 activator, although direct binding was not demonstrated. These findings suggested that TAO1 forms complexes with components of p38 MAP kinase cascades and may, therefore, be an important regulator of p38-dependent events. Here we report the isolation of cDNA clones encoding the complete sequence of TAO2, a close relative of TAO1. Both TAO1 and TAO2 are expressed most highly in brain cells, suggesting their tissue-restricted function (8Hutchison M. Berman K.S. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28625-28632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The in vitro substrate specificities of TAO1 and TAO2 are also similar. Importantly, TAO2, like TAO1, copurifies with MEK3 endogenous to Sf9 cells. This suggests that the intracellular specificity of TAO proteins may be determined by their ability to bind stably to a subset of potential MEK substrates. To define the mechanism by which TAO proteins associate with MEKs, we determined that they interacted directly, identified the MEK binding domain of TAO2, and examined the MEK specificity of this domain. A 420-base pair PCR product was obtained as described (8Hutchison M. Berman K.S. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28625-28632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) using oligonucleotides based on the yeast Ste20p sequence. This product was labeled with [α-32P]dCTP by random priming and used to probe approximately 1.3 × 106 plaques of a random-primed adult rat forebrain cDNA library and approximately 0.6 × 106 plaques of an oligo(dT)-primed rat brain cDNA library (both provided by Jim Boulter, UCLA). cDNA clones encoding TAO1 and TAO2 were obtained. Subsequent rounds of screening yielded the full-length TAO2 cDNA, which was assembled into pBluescript from 3 of over 50 positive clones. The complete sequence of the assembled cDNA was deposited in GenBankTM with the accession number AF140556. pBluescript-TAO2-(1–320), containing the catalytic domain of TAO2, and a catalytically defective mutant pBluescript-TAO2D169A were generated by PCR. Wild-type TAO2, TAO2D169A, and TAO2-(1–320) were cloned into pRSETB (Invitrogen) to incorporate a MRGSH6 tag and subsequently transferred into the baculoviral shuttle vector pVL1393. Recombinant viruses were selected as described (8Hutchison M. Berman K.S. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28625-28632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). For expression in mammalian cells, the cDNAs encoding these TAO2 proteins were also cloned into pCMV5 that had been modified to place a Myc epitope tag at the N terminus of the encoded protein. A truncated, catalytically defective TAO2 in pRSETB was created by changing lysine 57, in the conserved VAIK motif, to alanine (K57A) by PCR. For binding assays, fragments of TAO2 were subcloned into pGEX-KG by PCR. TAO2-(314–451) was subsequently transferred into pRSETA utilizing the BamHI and EcoRI restriction sites. Catalytically defective MEK3 was created in pNPT7–5 by changing lysine 64 to methionine (K64M). A MEK1/6 chimera, which contains the N-terminal domain of MEK1 and the C-terminal domain of MEK6, and a MEK6/1 chimera with the reciprocal domains (see Fig. 4 B) were transferred into pRSETA or -C, respectively, from the original pGEX-KG-MEK1/6 and MEK6/1 plasmids (generously provided by Lori Christerson) utilizing the BamHI and HindIII restriction sites. Recombinant histidine-tagged TAO2, TAO2-(1–320), and TAO2D169A were expressed and harvested from Sf9 cells as described previously for TAO1 (8Hutchison M. Berman K.S. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28625-28632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Proteins were adsorbed to Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen) and eluted with a gradient of 20–250 mm imidazole in 0.5 mm dithiothreitol (DTT) and 0.3 m NaCl. His6-TAO2D169A was further purified on MonoQ (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) by elution with 50–450 mm NaCl in 1 mm DTT, 0.2 mm EGTA, 1 mmbenzamidine, 10% glycerol, and 20 mm Tris, pH 8. TAO2 was detected by Western blotting with an antibody to the MRGSH6epitope (Qiagen) and silver staining. GST fusion proteins, His6-tagged TAO2 C-terminal fragments, and other recombinant proteins were expressed and purified from bacteria essentially as described previously (20Guan K.L. Dixon J.E. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 192: 262-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (1635) Google Scholar). Induction of expression was with 30–300 μmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at 25 or 30 °C for 4–16 h, based on individual optimizations. pCMV5-Myc-TAO2 constructs were transfected into 293 cells using calcium phosphate (21Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). After 48 h, cells were lysed (22Frost J. Xu S. Hutchison M. Marcus S. Cobb M.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3707-3713Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar), and transfected proteins were detected by anti-Myc Western blotting. Lysate volumes containing equal amounts of expressed protein were used for subsequent immunoprecipitation with anti-Myc antibodies for kinase assays. Sf9 lysates containing His6-TAO2 proteins were incubated with Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose in buffer containing 0.15 m NaCl and 0.5 mm DTT and washed with 0.3m NaCl, 0.5 mm DTT, and 10 mmimidazole. Bound proteins were eluted with 250 mm imidazole in buffer and subjected to Western blotting with an anti-MEK3 antibody (23Khokhlatchev A. Xu S. English J. Wu P. Schaefer E. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11057-11062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Kinase assays contained 50 mm HEPES, pH 8, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 0.5 mg/ml myelin basic protein (MBP), and 100 μm ATP ([γ-32P]ATP, 2–7 cpm/fmol). Reactions were halted with 10 μl of 5× electrophoresis sample buffer, followed by boiling, and 20 μl were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography. For linked kinase assays, 50–250 ng of recombinant TAO2 protein was incubated with 50 ng of MEK proteins in 30 μl for 60 min at 30 °C; 5 μl of the reactions were added to second reactions containing K52R ERK2, p38, or GST-SAPKβ (23Khokhlatchev A.

Phosphoamino acids were determined as described (25Boyle W.J. van der Geer P. Hunter T. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 110-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1272) Google Scholar). For binding assays involving GST-tagged TAO2 fragments and His6-tagged MEK proteins, 3 μg of each GST fusion protein or GST alone was incubated with glutathione-agarose beads at 4 °C in the presence of 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin for 30 min and washed with 0.1 m NaCl in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4. 5 μg of His6-tagged protein were incubated with the beads in the presence of 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin and 0.1 m NaCl at 4 °C for 1 h. The beads were washed with 0.3 m NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4. Bound proteins were released with 1× SDS electrophoresis sample buffer and subjected to anti-His6 Western blotting. Similar binding assays were performed for His6-TAO2-(314–451) and GST-tagged MEK proteins. Degenerate oligonucleotide primers designed from the sequence of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae Ste20p kinase were used in PCR to amplify fragments of related protein kinases from rat cDNAs. One PCR product was used in isolating overlapping cDNAs from two rat brain cDNA libraries that encoded two protein kinases, TAO1 (8Hutchison M. Berman K.S. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28625-28632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) and the related kinase TAO2, described here. The assembled TAO2 cDNA predicted an open reading frame of 993 amino acids (Fig.1 A). The presumed start codon is located at base 193 and is preceded by an in-frame stop codon at base 145. The longest 3′-untranslated region was 1317 base pairs in length, including a poly(A) track at its end, ∼1.3 kilobase pairs 3′ to the stop codon (not shown). The deduced TAO2 protein has a calculated molecular mass of 114 kDa. The serine/threonine protein kinase catalytic domain is at its N terminus. In its 690 C-terminal residues, TAO2 contains a possible nucleotide binding site, a serine-rich region, and a proline and leucine-rich region, all shared with TAO1, and an unbroken stretch of 17 glutamic acid residues unique to TAO2. Like TAO1, TAO2 does not appear to contain a small G protein binding consensus motif found in several other Ste20p relatives (14Burbelo P.D. Drechsel D. Hall A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29071-29074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar). The TAO2 protein kinase domain displays 90 and 63% identity to TAO1 and the Caenorhabditis elegans TAO ortholog (CeTAO, accession number U32275), respectively (not shown). TAO2 displays marked similarities to TAO1 and the C. elegans kinase outside the catalytic domain (Fig. 1 B). Truncated, recombinant TAO2-(1–320) purified from Sf9 cells phosphorylated MBP with a specific activity of 0.6 μmol·min−1·mg−1. The full-length protein purified on MonoQ had lower intrinsic activity, about 10% of the truncated enzyme (not shown). Kinase-deficient mutants, His6-TAO2D169A expressed in Sf9 cells and purified on MonoQ or His6-TAO2K57A expressed in bacteria, were inactive toward MBP in vitro. TAO2 and TAO2-(1–320) expressed in either Sf9 or mammalian cells autophosphorylated extensively on serine and threonine residues (data not shown). TAO1 was previously shown to activate MEKs 3, 4, and 6 in vitro. We therefore examined the ability of TAO2 to activate MEK family members. TAO2-(1–320) produced in Sf9 cells was subjected to a linked kinase assay by incubating it with recombinant MEKs produced in bacteria in the presence of ATP. Aliquots of the first stage reactions were transferred to second reactions to measure the phosphorylation of appropriate MAP kinase substrates by the recombinant MEKs (Fig.2 A). TAO2-(1–320) activated MEK3 and MEK6 40- and 20-fold, respectively, toward their substrate p38 (Fig. 2 B). TAO2 also increased the ability of MEK4 to phosphorylate its substrate SAPK by 7-fold. TAO2-(1–320) was unable to increase the activity of MEK1 or MEK2 toward their substrate K52R ERK2. Full-length TAO2 displayed about 20% of the MEK3-activating ability of TAO2-(1–320), consistent with its lower activity toward MBP. Neither TAO2 mutants D169A nor K57A activated any of the MEKs (data not shown). TAO2-(1–320) expressed in 293 cells also enhanced the ability of MEK3 and MEK4 to phosphorylate their substrates (not shown). We found that recombinant TAO1 copurified with MEK3 endogenous to Sf9 cells, and overexpressed TAO1 interacted with MEK3 in 293 cells (8Hutchison M. Berman K.S. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28625-28632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). These observations led us to investigate whether TAO2 has similar properties. TAO2 proteins overexpressed in Sf9 cells (Fig.3 A) were purified on nickel resin and immunoblotted for MEK3. As a control, Sf9 cell lysates not expressing TAO2 were processed similarly. MEK3 endogenous to Sf9 cells was associated with full-length, wild-type TAO2 (Fig.3 B, lane 2; Fig. 3 C, lane 1) but not TAO2D169A (Fig. 3 C, lane 2), TAO2-(1–320) (Fig. 3 B, lane 3), or beads incubated with lysates from uninfected Sf9 cells (Fig.3 B, lane 1; Fig. 3 C, lane 3). These results demonstrated that TAO2 binds to MEK3, the interaction is mediated by the noncatalytic region of the protein, and TAO2 catalytic activity enhances MEK3 binding to the full-length protein. To determine the domain in TAO2 that mediates the interaction with MEK3, the series of fragments that span the noncatalytic domains of TAO2 were expressed as GST fusion proteins and tested for their abilities to bind His6-MEK3 in vitro (Fig.3 D). The MEK3 binding domain was localized to an ∼135-residue region, residues 314–451, just C-terminal to the TAO2 catalytic domain. This region was further subdivided, but all of the shorter fragments containing residues 395–451 were degraded. TAO2-(314–377), which precedes the polyglutamic acid region, was insufficient for MEK3 binding. To investigate the binding specificity of the TAO2 MEK binding domain, His6-tagged MEK proteins were compared for their capacity to bind to TAO2-(314–451). The TAO2 fragment bound MEK6 in addition to MEK3 but not MEK1, MEK2, or MEK4 (Fig. 4,A and D). Binding to both MEK3 and MEK6 is consistent with their significant sequence similarity compared with the other MEK family members. Chimeric proteins generated from MEK6 and MEK1 (Fig. 4 B) were used to determine the portion of the MEK that binds to the TAO2 domain. His6-MEK1/6 was unable to bind to TAO2-(314–451), whereas GST-MEK6/1 is as efficient as GST-MEK6 in binding to the TAO2 fragment (Fig. 4, C andD). As noted earlier, catalytically defective TAO2 was deficient in MEK3 binding. To explore the underlying reason, we asked whether autophosphorylation of TAO2 might have an effect on its ability to bind to MEK3. The MEK3 binding fragment of TAO2 was autophosphorylated by the catalytic domain of TAO2 on both serine and threonine residues (Fig. 5, A and B). We, thus, first phosphorylated TAO2-(314–451) with TAO-(1–320) for different lengths of time to determine whether phosphorylation would alter its binding activity. Different concentrations of ATP and Mg2+ were also tested in the binding assay. Little or no effect of the autophosphorylation state or [ATP·Mg2+] on MEK3 binding activity was observed (Fig. 5 C). To determine whether MEK3 kinase activity was necessary for binding to TAO2, the binding of kinase-inactive MEK3 (K64M) was tested (Fig.5 D). This defective mutant binds to TAO2 as well as wild-type MEK3, suggesting that MEK3 kinase activity is dispensable for interaction with TAO2. We isolated cDNAs encoding TAO2, a homolog of the previously reported TAO1 (8Hutchison M. Berman K.S. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28625-28632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). We found that TAO2, like TAO1, activated MEKs in the stress-responsive MAP kinase pathways and displayed stable binding to MEK3 endogenous to Sf9 cells. In examining TAO2 expressed in Sf9 cells, we found that the full-length enzyme was significantly less active than the truncated kinase. Thus, the full-length protein was inhibited relative to its truncated forms. Subsequent work indicated that full-length TAO1 is also less active than proteins with C-terminal domain truncations. The inherently higher activity of fragments of TAO1 and -2 suggested that we may have removed an autoinhibitory or pseudosubstrate domain. However, we have not yet identified such a domain, as none of the recombinant fragments from the putative regulatory domain of TAO2 inhibited the activity of its catalytic domain (not shown). Because TAO2 was purified in a stable complex with MEK3 endogenous to Sf9 cells, we localized the MEK binding domain to a small, ∼135-amino acid fragment, residues 314–451, just C-terminal to the catalytic domain of TAO2. The N-terminal half of this fragment, residues 314–377, did not bind to MEK3. Because TAO1 and TAO2 both bind MEKs but TAO1 has no polyglutamate stretch, it seems unlikely that these residues participate in MEK binding. Thus, residues from 395 to 451 are most likely required for the stable association with MEKs. These results are consistent with the weak binding of TAO1-(1–416) to MEK3 compared with the strong binding displayed by full-length TAO1 (8Hutchison M. Berman K.S. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28625-28632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) and suggest that residues 404–446, which are well conserved between TAO2 and TAO1, contain the MEK binding domain. Because TAO1 and -2 can activate MEKs 3, 4, and 6 in vitro, we determined the specificity of the MEK binding domain of TAO2. We found that TAO2 binds to MEK3 and MEK6, but not to MEK4, despite the fact that MEK4 is an in vitro substrate. The N terminus of the MEK is required for this binding, whereas the C terminus is dispensable. This behavior may be a general property of the organization of MAP kinase cascades. The N termini of other MEK family members contain binding domains for proteins in their cascades. MEK1 binds with high affinity to ERK2 through a basic motif N-terminal to its catalytic domain. MEK1 has been proposed to retain ERK2 in the cytoplasm of unstimulated cells through binding to this site (26Fukuda M. Gotoh Y. Nishida E. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1901-1908Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar), and activation of ERK2 may be impaired if this binding domain is absent. 2B. Xu, J. Wilsbacher, T. Collisson, and M. Cobb, manuscript in preparation. MEK4 is reported to require its N-terminal extension to interact with both MEKK1, an activator, and its substrates, JNK/SAPKs (17Xia Y. Wu Z. Su B. Murray B. Karin M. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3369-3381Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). An inhibitory interaction between MEK4 and JNK/SAPKs has also been mapped to this N-terminal domain. 3B. J. Mayer, personal communication. This suggests that the stable association of MEK3 or MEK6 with TAO proteins will link their physiological functions to p38 but not JNK/SAPK pathways by restricting their intracellular targets. Future biochemical studies will focus on determining the functions of the other domains of TAO1 and TAO2.

https://openalex.org/W2321418341,"The BRCT region, the carboxyl-terminus of BRCA1 (the breast cancer susceptibility gene 1 product), is a ubiquitous region homologous to regions in DNA repair enzymes and cell cycle regulators. We showed that the BRCT regions bound DNA fragments, using the TopBP1 protein (topoisomerase II binding protein 1), with eight BRCTs as a model protein. The bindings were independent of DNA sequences, forms of DNA termini and energy. The BRCT-DNA complex showed resistance to an exonuclease, indicating that BRCT bound DNA breaks. The BRCTs also bound DNA nicks, suggesting that BRCTs play an important role in detection of both single- and double-strand DNA breaks or ends. On the other hand, BRCTs did not bind circular intact DNA. BRCTs of BRCA1 also bound DNA termini. Since some BRCTs are unique general elements in some tumor suppressions, these findings will reveal novel aspects of the tumor suppression mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W2091095874,"Cardosin A is an abundant aspartic proteinase from pistils of Cynara cardunculus L. whose milk-clotting activity has been exploited for the manufacture of cheese. Here we report the cloning and characterization of cardosin A cDNA. The deduced amino acid sequence contains the conserved features of plant aspartic proteinases, including the plant-specific insertion (PSI), and revealed the presence of an Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) motif, which is known to function in cell surface receptor binding by extracellular proteins. Cardosin A mRNA was detected predominantly in young flower buds but not in mature or senescent pistils, suggesting that its expression is likely to be developmentally regulated. Procardosin A, the single chain precursor, was found associated with microsomal membranes of flower buds, whereas the active two-chain enzyme generated upon removal of PSI is soluble. This result implies a role for PSI in promoting the association of plant aspartic proteinase precursors to cell membranes. To get further insights about cardosin A, the functional relevance of the RGD motif was also investigated. A 100-kDa protein that interacts specifically with the RGD sequence was isolated from octyl glucoside pollen extracts by affinity chromatography on cardosin A-Sepharose. This result suggests that the 100-kDa protein is a cardosin A receptor and indicates that the interaction between these two proteins is apparently mediated through RGD recognition.

Aspartic Proteinases. Plenum Press, New York1998Crossref Google Scholar) are widely distributed in the plant kingdom, and they have been purified and characterized from several species of monocotyledons, dicotyledons, and gymnosperms (2Kervinen J.

In common with most of the aspartic proteinases from retrovirus, bacteria, yeast, fungi, and vertebrates, plant aspartic proteinases are inhibited by pepstatin (a hexapeptide from Streptomyces), have an acid pH optimum, and preferentially cleave peptide bonds between hydrophobic residues. The amino acid sequences of some plant aspartic proteinases have recently been deduced (3Runeberg-Roos P. Törmäkangas K. Östman A. Eur. J.

Although the molecular and physiological relevance of this domain is not yet known, a significant secondary structural similarity with saposins has been noted (10Guruprasad K. Törmäkangas K.

Both cardosins are two-chain glycosylated enzymes, which are thought to have arisen by gene duplication (17Verı́ssimo P. Faro C. Moir A.J.G. Lin Y. Tang J. Pires E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 235: 762-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Although they preferably cleave peptide bonds between residues with bulky hydrophobic side chains, cardosin B displays a broader specificity and a higher proteolytic activity (17Verı́ssimo P. Faro C. Moir A.J.G. Lin Y. Tang J. Pires E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 235: 762-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 18Ramalho-Santos M. Verı́ssimo P. Faro C. Pires E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1297: 83-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Cardosin A, the more abundant one, is accumulated to a high amount in protein storage vacuoles of the stigmatic papillae and is also found in vacuoles of the epidermic cells of style (11Ramalho-Santos M. Pissarra J. Verı́ssimo P. Pereira S. Salema R. Pires E. Faro C.J. Planta ( Berl. ). 1997; 203: 204-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that cardosin A may be involved in pollen-pistil interaction and possibly in the defense against pathogens or invasion (11Ramalho-Santos M. Pissarra J. Verı́ssimo P. Pereira S. Salema R. Pires E. Faro C.J. Planta ( Berl. ). 1997; 203: 204-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The evidence, however, is lacking to support these hypotheses. To gain more insights about the possible biological function(s) of cardosin A, we have cloned its cDNA. As will be described herein, a unique feature of cardosin A, among plant aspartic proteinases, is the presence of a functional RGD sequence. The RGD motif is well known as an integrin-binding sequence in mammalian tissues in which it facilitates many cell recognition functions such as adhesion, migration, signaling, differentiation, and growth (19Ruoslahti E. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 697-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (2589) Google Scholar). Although these events have been well studied in animals, little evidence is available for the occurrence of integrin-like proteins and their ligands in plants. Integrin-like proteins of plant origin have been identified either by their binding to RGD-containing peptides (20Schindler M. Meiners S. Cheresh D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 1955-1964Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 21Wayne R. Staves M.P. Leopold A.C. J. Cell Sci. 1992; 101: 611-623PubMed Google Scholar, 22Zhu J. Shi J. Singh U.

Similarly, vitronectin-like proteins, which are supposed to interact with plant integrin-like proteins through their RGD sequence, were detected in the extracellular matrix of several plant tissues (28Sanders L.C.

However, the RGD-containing protein and its interacting receptor have not both being identified in any case. In the present paper, we described the cloning of cardosin A cDNA and the identification of a 100-kDa receptor from pollen that interacts specifically with the region of the proteinase that contains an RGD cell attachment sequence. The physiological relevance of these findings, in particular the possible involvement of a proteinase in RGD-mediated molecular mechanisms in plants, is also discussed. Organs of Cynara cardunculus L. were collected from clones previously used for biochemical studies. These plants were grown from seeds supplied by the Botanical Garden of the University of Coimbra. In most cases, organs were collected, frozen immediately in liquid nitrogen, and kept at −80 °C until use. Total RNA was isolated from flower buds ofC. cardunculus L. essentially as described in Ref. 32Pawlowski K. Kunze R. deVries S. Bisseling T. Plant Mol. Biol. 1994; D5: 1-13Google Scholar, and the poly(A) mRNA was isolated using a Poly(A)Tract mRNA isolation kit (Promega). The RNA was used to generate double-stranded cDNA, and upon ligation of the Marathon cDNA adaptor, 5′- and 3′-RACE were performed using the Marathon cDNA amplification kit (CLONTECH) according to the manufacturer's instructions. RACE was performed with cardosinA-specific primers (card 1S, GAGTTGTGTGAACACTTATCCA; card 1R, TGGATAAGTGTTCACACAACTC) and the adaptor primer AP1 (ACTCACTATAGGGCTCGAGCGGC). The PCR-amplified cDNA fragments were cloned and sequenced. Based on these sequences, specific primers for the 5′- (primer S, ATGGGTACCTCAATCAAAGCA) and 3′- (primer R, TCAAGCTGCTTCTGCAAATCC) ends of the open reading frame were synthesized, and full-length cDNAs of cardosin A were PCR-amplified from the cDNA library. The PCR products were cloned, and both strands were sequenced by automated DNA sequencing. DNA sequencing was performed in a Vistra DNA Automatic Sequencer 725 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Primers were labeled with Texas Red using the 5′-oligonucleotide Texas Red labeling kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and sequencing reactions were carried out with the Thermo sequenase premixed cycle sequencing kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using the dideoxynucleotide chain termination method. Total RNA was isolated from 100 mg of plant tissue using the RNeasy Plant Mini kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. RNA (5 μg) was separated on 1.2% agarose gels containing formaldehyde and transferred to a positively charged nylon membrane (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) by capilarity overnight at 4 °C. RNA was cross-linked to the membrane by baking at 120 °C for 30 min, and prehybridization was performed in standard hybridization buffer with formamide for 1 h at 50 °C. A 1.5-kilobase fragment of cardosin A cDNA corresponding to the coding region was labeled with DIG High Prime (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) by the random prime labeling technique and was used as a probe. Hybridization was carried out in hybridization buffer overnight at 50 °C, and detection was performed with the DIG luminescent detection kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Total RNA was isolated as described above for Northern blotting. RT-PCR was performed with the Superscript RT-PCR kit (Life Technologies, Inc.) using similar amounts of total RNA and the following primers (forward, 5′-CTC GGC CTT TCA TTT CAA ACG-3′; reverse, 5′-CGG GTT GTA TCT TAG ATC GG-3′). PCR products were visualized on agarose gel as 437-base pair cDNA fragments. Two oligonucleotides containing 5′-flanking restriction site NheI (primer Pro-NheI, GCTAGCTCCGATGACGGATTGATTCGA and primer 3′-NheI, GCTAGCTCAAGCTGCTTCTGCAAATCC) were used to PCR amplify procardosin A. The resulting fragment, without the putative signal sequence, was cloned into a TA vector and then subcloned into the NheI cloning site of the pEt11a expression vector. The recombinant plasmid (pEt11a-PcardA) was transformed into E. coli strain BL21 cells, and expression was carried out under the control of the T7 promoter. Induction, isolation of inclusion bodies, refolding, and purification of recombinant procardosin A were carried out essentially as described for canditropsin (33Lin X. Tang J. Koelsch G. Monod M. Foundling S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20143-20147Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The proteolytic activity was assayed using the chromogenic synthetic peptide Lys-Pro-Ala-Glu-Phe-Phe(NO2)-Ala-Leu as substrate (17Verı́ssimo P. Faro C. Moir A.J.G. Lin Y. Tang J. Pires E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 235: 762-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). For antibody production, 100 μg of recombinant procardosin A was emulsified with Freund's complete adjuvant and injected subcutaneously into a New Zealand rabbit from which preimmune blood had been collected. A second injection was made 3 weeks later using recombinant procardosin A emulsified with Freund's incomplete adjuvant. The antiserum was prepared from blood collected 3 weeks after this last injection. Organs and pistils at different stages of development were ground in a mortar and pestle under liquid nitrogen and then homogenized at 20% (m/v) in 100 mm Tris-Bicine, 2% (m/v) SDS, 8 m urea. Extracts obtained were centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, and samples of the supernatants containing about 10 μg of protein were loaded onto 15% polyacrylamide gels for SDS-PAGE. Electrophoresis and transfer onto nitrocellulose membranes were performed as described previously (19Ruoslahti E. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 697-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (2589) Google Scholar). For immunodetection, the membranes were incubated in blocking solution, 0.5% (m/v) skim milk in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20 for 45 min at room temperature and then incubated overnight with a 1:500 dilution of the recombinant cardosin A antibody in blocking solution. The membranes were washed 3 times in blocking solution for 10 min and incubated with a 1:1000 dilution of swine anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase for 1 h. The membranes were again washed 3 times in blocking solution for 10 min, and peroxidase activity was developed by luminol chemiluminescence using the ECL method according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Young flower bud extracts obtained in 8.0% sucrose, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 mm Tris, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C, and the resulting pellet was washed with extraction buffer and resuspended in SDS-PAGE loading buffer. SDS-PAGE, electrotransference, and immunodetection were essentially performed as described above except that a monospecific antibody for PSI (9Ramalho-Santos M. Verı́ssimo P. Cortes L. Samyn B. Van Beeumen J. Pires E. Faro C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 255: 133-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) was used as primary antibody at a 1:200 dilution. Pollen (100 mg) was ground in a mortar and pestle under liquid nitrogen, and pollen proteins were extracted in 500 μl of 10 mmNa2HPO4, 1.8 mmKH2PO4, 137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 2 mm MgCl2 (PBS, pH 7.0) containing 3 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μmpepstatin A, and 200 mm octyl glucoside. The extract was centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 15 min (4 °C), and the supernatant (400 μl) was applied to a cardosin A-Sepharose column (bead volume, 1 ml). The affinity matrix had been prepared by incubating 1 mg of cardosin A purified from stigmas of C. cardunculus L. as described in Ref. 17Verı́ssimo P. Faro C. Moir A.J.G. Lin Y. Tang J. Pires E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 235: 762-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar with 1 ml of CNBr-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), according to the manufacturer's instructions. The extract was incubated with the resin overnight at 4 °C, and the column was then washed with 5 ml of PBS containing 3 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μmpepstatin A, and 50 mm octyl glucoside (column buffer) and with 5 ml of column buffer containing 1% (v/v) dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO). Elution was made with 4 ml of column buffer containing 1% (v/v) Me2SO and NHFRGDHT peptide (1 mg/ml). The affinity-purified cardosin A receptor (8 μg) in PBS was blotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane in a TransVac apparatus (Hoeffer Pharmacia Biotech). The membrane was blocked with 0.5% skim milk in PBS and then incubated 1 h at room temperature with 1.5 nmol of natural cardosin A in PBS in the absence or presence of 20-fold molar excess of RGDS (Sigma). After several washes with blocking buffer, the bound cardosin A was detected using the antirecombinant cardosin A antibody (1:1000) as described above for Western blot analysis. In the first stage, a 0.8-kilobase internal segment of the cardosin A cDNA was PCR-amplified using degenerated primers encoding two amino acid sequences previously determined by protein sequencing (17Verı́ssimo P. Faro C. Moir A.J.G. Lin Y. Tang J. Pires E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 235: 762-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Based upon the sequence of this fragment, whose nature was confirmed by comparison with the partial amino acid sequence of cardosin A, primers were designed to amplify a full-length cDNA from a young flower bud cDNA Marathon library. Most of the 5′-RACE-PCR fragments contained a putative ATG start codon, whereas all 3′-RACE-PCR fragments contained three stop codons plus the poly(A) sequence. The cardosin A cDNA was finally obtained from the cDNA library using specific primers for the 5′- and 3′-ends of the open reading frame. The nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences are shown in Fig.1 A. The 1515-base pair cDNA sequence encodes a signal peptide of about 24 amino acids, a prosegment of 42 residues, and a 438-amino acid-long polypeptide containing the two chains of mature cardosin A. In common with other plant aspartic proteinases, the cDNA-derived amino acid sequence of cardosin A also contains an internal segment of 104 amino acids, which bears no homology with mammalian or microbial aspartic proteinases. This fragment known as PSI separates the two chains that occur in mature form of cardosin A (Fig. 1 B). Critical residues for aspartic proteinase activity can be identified in the sequence. They include two catalytic triads (DTG and DSG) both located at the 31-kDa chain and a conserved tyrosine residue (Tyr-75 in pepsin numbering) present in the flap that overlies the active site cleft of aspartic proteinases. Two putative N-glycosylation sites are found in the sequence, at residues 139 and 432, one in each chain of the mature enzyme. Interestingly, an internal RGD cell attachment motif typical of integrin ligands is present within the cardosin A sequence between residues 246 and 248. Because cardosin A was isolated from flowers, expression of its mRNA was monitored by Northern blot analysis at three different floral development stages (closed, partially opened, and fully opened capitula). A single band was detected on gel blots of total RNA from young flowers buds probed with the cardosin A cDNA (Fig.2 A, lane 1). The size of cardosin A mRNA is estimated to be 1.7 kilobases, which is in agreement with the sequence data obtained from the RACE clones. The highest level of expression was found in the closed capitula, and no cardosin A mRNA was detected at the later stages of floral development (Fig. 2 A). To analyze the expression pattern at the protein level throughout floral development, a polyclonal antibody was raised against recombinant procardosin A produced in E. coli. As described under “Experimental Procedures” the cDNA fragment encoding procardosin A (the first 25 amino acids corresponding to the signal peptide were deleted) was cloned into pET11 and expressed in E. coli BL21. The protein was recovered from inclusion bodies, and although most of the protein was probably misfolded after several refolding steps, some recombinant procardosin A was purified by gel filtration followed by ion exchange chromatography on a Q Trap column. The recombinant procardosin A had no proteolytic activity when a series of synthetic peptides or κ-casein were used as substrates. The recombinant procardosin A was therefore used to produce a polyclonal antibody against the precursor form of the proteinase. The antibody recognizes predominantly the 31-kDa chain of mature cardosin A and a 67-kDa protein, which corresponds to procardosin A, the PSI-containing precursor form. Western blot analysis revealed that the levels of the precursor in the first stages of development correlate positively with those of mRNA (Fig. 2 B). Conversely, the highest levels of mature cardosin A were observed in fully opened capitula when no mRNA was detected. These results suggest that the proteinase is expressed at the first stages of floral development, converted into its mature form as the flower matures, and then accumulated until the later stages of flower senescence. Expression of cardosin A mRNA in several organs of C. cardunculus L. was first investigated by Northern blot analysis using the cardosin cDNA as a probe. Cardosin mRNA was consistently not detected in several organs tested other then young flower buds, suggesting that its expression is highly restricted to this organ. Conversely, when RT-PCR was used to study cardosin A mRNA expression in the same organs, besides being detected in flower buds, expression was detected in seeds, pollen, and bracteas but not in roots or leaves (Fig.3). In this assay, cardosin A mRNA was detected as a PCR-amplified fragment of about 450 base pairs. These results suggest that cardosin A is likely to be expressed in these organs at low levels that can only be detected when a more sensitive technique is used to examine its expression. The predicted secondary structure of PSI suggests that this extra domain of plant aspartic proteinases has an amphipathic character (10Guruprasad K. Törmäkangas K. Kervinen J. Blundell T.L. FEBS Lett. 1994; 352: 131-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Because proteins with such domains are known to interact with lipid membranes it would be possible that PSI might promote association with cell membranes. To test this hypothesis, fractionation studies were carried out to determine whether the precursor form of cardosin A containing the PSI domain (procardosin A) is soluble or membrane-associated. Protein extracts of young flower buds were subjected to differential centrifugation, and the resulting pellets were analyzed by immunoblotting using an antibody raised against a peptide whose sequence corresponds to a segment of PSI predicted to be exposed. As shown in Fig. 4, procardosin A was detected as a 67-kDa band in the pellet of the 100,000 ×g fraction, indicating that the precursor form is associated with microsomal membranes. Conversely, the mature two-chain enzyme was detected in supernatants of 10,000 and 100,000 × gcentrifuged samples. Therefore these results suggest that the PSI domain may have a role in the membrane association of the precursor form of cardosin A. The presence of the RGD cell attachment sequence raised the question of whether it could be functionally active. To determine whether a cardosin A-binding protein occurs in pollen, cardosin A was immobilized in a Sepharose matrix and used for affinity chromatography of detergent-extracted pollen (Fig. 5). Elution was made with an RGD-containing synthetic peptide designed from the amino acid sequence of cardosin A. A pollen cardosin A-binding protein with an apparent molecular mass of 100 kDa was specifically eluted with 1 mm RGD-containing peptide (Fig. 5,lanes 7 and 8). This 100-kDa protein was not eluted when a nonrelated peptide was used (Fig. 5, lanes 5and 6) or when the chromatography was performed in an albumin-Sepharose column. Other proteins were released throughout the wash fractions, but they were not influenced by the presence of the RGD peptide in the elution buffer. Some of the 100-kDa protein appeared to be gradually released during washing, indicating a low affinity binding to cardosin A. An additional experiment using ligand blotting analysis was performed to confirm that the purified 100-kDa protein interacts with cardosin A. The purified 100-kDa protein was blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and incubated with cardosin A either in the absence or presence of an excess of the RGDS peptide. As shown in Fig.6, the antibody raised against recombinant procardosin A recognizes bound cardosin A in the membrane incubated in the absence of RGDS, whereas a very faint halo is observed in the one incubated in the presence of RGDS. These results further support the hypothesis that the interaction between cardosin A and its putative receptor is apparently mediated by the RGD sequence. Plant aspartic proteinase precursors can easily be distinguished from their animal and microbial counterparts by the presence of the PSI domain. Although the molecular and physiological relevance of this domain is still unknown, a structural similarity to saposins has been noted (10Guruprasad K. Törmäkangas K. Kervinen J. Blundell T.L. FEBS Lett. 1994; 352: 131-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Based on this observation, it has been proposed that PSI may function as a vacuolar-targeting signal (10Guruprasad K. Törmäkangas K. Kervinen J. Blundell T.L. FEBS Lett. 1994; 352: 131-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) in a way similar to the involvement of saposins in the co-transport of cathepsin D to the lysosome. Our results suggest, however, that the primary function of PSI is to facilitate the association of the precursors to the membrane, most probably at the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum. This hypothesis is consistent with the predicted amphipathic nature of the PSI domain and further supported by the membrane binding properties of saposins and other saposin-like proteins such as NK-lysin and surfactant B protein (34Vaccaro A.M.

FEBS Lett. 1995; 362: 328-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). It is possible that membrane association is a prerequisite for signaling plant aspartic proteinases to the vacuole. However, in the particular case of cardosin A, which is overexpressed at the early stages of floral development, this seems to be also a mechanism by which the proteinase is addressed to the cell surface. As will be discussed below, the localization at the cell surface therefore facilitates the interaction of cardosin A with its putative pollen receptor. We have shown previously that cardosin A is expressed abundantly in the stigmatic papillae (11Ramalho-Santos M. Pissarra J. Verı́ssimo P. Pereira S. Salema R. Pires E. Faro C.J. Planta ( Berl. ). 1997; 203: 204-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Most of the protein was found accumulated in protein storage vacuoles and some labeling was also found in the cell wall. The results obtained in the present work clearly show that although cardosin A is accumulated until the later stages of floral senescence, expression of its mRNA occurs mainly at early stages. These results suggest that expression of this enzyme is likely to be developmentally regulated. Cardosin A mRNA was also found in other organs of C. cardunculus L., namely in pollen and seeds, in which the enzyme had not been identified, in previous studies. Western blot analysis using a polyclonal antibody raised against recombinant procardosin A and a more sensitive detection assay allowed the detection of cardosin A in those organs, although at low levels. 2P. Veríssimo and M. Vieira, unpublished results. Cardosin A mRNA was not detected in mature leaves and roots, and thus its expression is apparently and interestingly associated with organs or tissues that undergo substantial morphological changes. In this respect, it is worthwhile to note that expression of cardosin A mRNA in immature pistils also precedes pistil growth and elongation suggesting an involvement in such developmental processes. Cardosin A is unique among plant aspartic proteinases for having an RGD motif. The crystal structure of cardosin A 3Frazao, C., Bento, I., Costa, J., Soares, C. M., Verissimo, P., Faro, C., Pires, E., Cooper, J., and Carrondo, M. A. (1999) J. Biol. Chem. 274, 27694–27701. The atomic coordinates and structure factors (code 1B5F) are available from the Protein Data Bank, Research Collaboratory for Structural Bioinformatics, Rutgers University, New Brunswick, NJ. shows that this sequence is located in a loop that connects two β-strands and projects itself above the molecular surface. A similar structure is found in fibronectin (37Leahy D.J. Aukhil I. Erickson H.P. Cell. 1996; 84: 155-164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar), suggesting that cardosin A might be functionally active in promoting binding to integrin or integrin-like proteins. This hypothesis is further supported by the identification of the 100-kDa protein from pollen that specifically interacts with the RGD sequence in cardosin A. Similarly to the binding of integrins to their ligands (19Ruoslahti E. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 697-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (2589) Google Scholar), the interaction between cardosin A and its putative receptor seems to be of low affinity. We have at this point no information on the distribution of the putative receptor in the plant, and further studies will be required for substantiating its in vivo role in cardosin A recognition. The results herein described are the first evidence for the involvement of a proteinase in RGD-dependent recognition in plants. In animals, cell migration both during development and tumor invasion relies on adhesion to extracellular matrix proteins and often requires proteolytic remodeling of the matrix by cell-bound metalloproteinases containing RGD sequences that promote their attachment to integrins (38Basbaum C.B. Werb Z. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 731-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar, 39Brooks P.C. Stromblad S. Sanders L.C. von Schalscha T.L. Aimes R.T. Stetler-Stevenson W.G. Quigley J.P. Cheresh D.A. Cell. 1996; 85: 683-693Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1435) Google Scholar, 40Rooke J. Pan D. Xu T. Rubin G.M. Science. 1996; 273: 1227-1231Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Plants may also use proteinases in a similar way in molecular events of cell growth and differentiation. Because cardosin A is abundantly expressed in the stigmatic papillae and its putative receptor is present in pollen, it is likely that this RGD-dependent recognition may be active in pollen-pistil interaction. Lord and Sanders (41Lord E.M. Sanders L.C. Dev. Biol. 1992; 153: 16-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) have proposed a model for pollen tube extension that predicts the existence and involvement of integrins and extracellular matrix ligands. This process occurs by tip extension in a way analogous to axonal growth and can be viewed as a special case of cell migration (41Lord E.M. Sanders L.C. Dev. Biol. 1992; 153: 16-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). It is thus possible that cardosin A participates in adhesion-mediated proteolytic mechanisms associated with pollen tube growth, very much in the way of integrin-bound proteases in cell proliferation and invasion. Further studies are required to elucidate the involvement of this RGD-containing proteinase in pollen-pistil interaction."

We cloned and characterized the rat cyclin D1 gene 5′-flanking region and, by species- and subspecies-matched transient transfection studies, found that a basic promoter structure with a cAMP response element and two continuous Sp1-binding sites was crucial for the steady-state expression of the cyclin D1 gene. Furthermore, the methylation status especially around two continuous Sp1-binding sites was found to be an important epigenetical mechanism determining the steady-state expression level in rat leukemic cell lines K4D, K4DT, and K4D16. Whether or not epigenetic control of the cyclin D1 gene existed among normal rat tissues was further examined by high sensitivity mapping of the methylated cytosine. In normal rat tissues, the methylated cytosines at non-CpG loci within two continuous Sp1-binding sites were observed in uterine stromal cells of the basal layer and found to be demethylated in the functioning layer, possibly by a passive demethylation mechanism through cell division. Since in the passive demethylation process Sp1-binding sites remain methylated in a part of the cell population, methylated cytosines at Sp1-binding sites may be essential for keeping a number of the stromal cells in the basal layer live against estrogen-induced proliferation that leads to either apoptosis or compaction.

To analyze the mechanism of overexpression of the cyclin D1 gene in leukemic cell lines, we first isolated and characterized the 5′-regulatory region of Long-Evans rat cyclin D1 gene and then assessed the possibility of epigenetic control of gene expression by aberrant cytosine methylation of the CpG dinucleotide. Whether or not such epigenetic control of the cyclin D1 gene existed naturally among normal rat tissues was further examined in microdissected samples by the recently introduced high sensitivity mapping of methylated cytosine (27Olek A. Oswald J. Walter J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 5064-5066Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). We found that the steady-state expression of the cyclin D1 gene was influenced by the methylation status, as an epigenetic event, of its 5′-flanking region in rat leukemic and endometrial stromal cells. Long-Evans rat-derived 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene-induced leukemic cell lines, K2D, K3D, K4D, K4D16, and K4DT, established in our laboratory (28Maeda S. Uenaka H. Ueda N. Shiraishi N. Suglyama T.

Total cellular RNA was extracted from rat leukemic cell lines K2D, K3D, K4D, K4D16, and K4DT by RNAzol (Tel-Test, Inc., Friendswood, TX). RNA samples (10 μg) were separated by denaturing electrophoresis in formaldehyde-agarose gels, and stained with ethidium bromide.

The membranes were washed twice in 2 × SSC containing 0.1% SDS, 1 × SSC containing 0.1% SDS and finally 0.1 × SSC containing 0.1% SDS at 60 °C and then analyzed with image analyzer BAS-EWS 4075 (FUJIX, Tokyo, Japan). The rat cyclin D1 cDNA probe (31Kitazawa S. Ross F.P. McHugh K. Teitelbaum S.L. J. Biol.

The relative expression level was estimated by the optical density of the cyclin D1 mRNA band standardized by that of rat glyceraldehyde-6-phosphate dehydrogenase. Subconfluent cells in 100-mm culture dishes were lysed with 1.0 ml of ice-cold lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 0.2% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, and 50 μm/ml aprotinin). After sonication for 1 min, lysates were centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 20 min. Supernatants, equalized by protein concentration, were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred to the nylon membrane (Amersham), and immunoblotted with a primary antibody against human, rat, and mouse cyclin D1 (R-124, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Immunocomplexes were visualized using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies with cobalt and nickel intensifiers. Cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and collected by scrapping in 1 × SSC before being centrifuged at 1500 rpm for 5 min. Nuclei were extracted in lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mmNaCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 0.5% Nonidet P-40) for 10 min on ice, and centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 5 min. The pellets were washed twice with lysis buffer and resuspended with 0.5 ml of suspension buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 40% glycerol, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA). The suspended nuclei were mixed with 100 μl of reaction mixture (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mm MgCl2, 300 mm KCl, 0.5 mm each of ATP, CTP, GTP, 100 μCi of [α-32P]UTP 3000 μCi/mm), and transcribed, in vitro, for 30 min at 30 °C (31Kitazawa S.

After DNase I treatment (final concentration 20 μg/ml) for 30 min at 30 °C, transcription was halted with 200 μl of stop solution (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 2% SDS, 10 mm EDTA, 200 μg/ml proteinase K), and the nuclei were incubated for 30 min at 42 °C. After extraction in phenol/chloroform, 50 μg of carrier RNA and 5 ml of ice-cold 5% trichloroacetic acid were added to the supernatant; the solution was incubated for 30 min on ice and then filtered through a nitrocellulose membrane (2.5 cm in diameter, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The blotted membrane was washed three times with 3% trichloroacetic acid and incubated with 0.9 ml of the incubation solution (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 5 mmMgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 25 μg/ml DNase I) for 30 min at 37 °C. Labeled RNA was eluted by incubation in 30 μl of 0.5 m EDTA and 100 μl of 10% SDS for 10 min at 60 °C, purified by proteinase K (25 μg/ml) treatment for 30 min at 37 °C and ethanol precipitation, and finally dissolved in 50 μl of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5 and 2 mm EDTA. A quantity of 10 μg each of rat cyclin D1 cDNA, rat glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase cDNA, and vector DNA was denatured in 50 μl of 0.2 n NaOH for 30 min at 27 °C, neutralized with 500 μl of 6 × SSC, slot-blotted onto nylon membranes saturated with H2O and 6 × SSC, and probed with transcribed RNA in hybridization solution (50% formamide, 5 × SSC, 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.5, 1 × Denhardt's solution, 1 × Background Quencher (Tel-Test, Inc.)) mixed at 50% (v/v) with dextran sulfate for 48 h at 42 °C. The membranes were washed with 2 × SSC, 0.1% SDS for 15 min at 27 °C, and with 0.2 × SSC, 0.1% SDS for 30 min at 65 °C, and exposed to Kodak X-Omat film for 2 days at −80 °C. High-molecular weight genomic DNA was isolated and purified from the Long-Evans rat leukemic cell line, K4D, by standard procedures. A quantity of 10 μg of rat genomic DNA was completely digested with BglII then ligated into the BamHI site of the EMBL3 phage vector (Promega), and packaged with GigaPack gold kit (Stratagene). The original Long-Evans genomic DNA library contained 5 × 106 independent phage plaques with an average insert size of 11.0 kilobase pairs. The rat genomic library was screened with a PCR amplified rat cyclin D1 (32Tamura K. Kanaoka Y. Jinno S. Nagata A. Ogiso Y. Shimizu K. Hayakawa T. Nojima H. Okayama H.

After tertial screening, theSacI-digested portion of the genomic clone was subcloned into the plasmid pGEM 7Z(+) (Promega), and sequenced by the ideoxynucleotide termination method. Primer extension was carried out as described previously (33Kitazawa S. Kitazawa R. Tamada H. Maeda S. Biochim. Biophys Acta. 1998; 1443: 358-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Briefly, 100 ng of the oligonucleotide, complementary to nucleotides of the cyclin D1 cDNA, was labeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase to a specific activity of 2 × 108 cpm/g. A 2.0 × 106 cpm of the oligonucleotide was annealed for 2 h at 40 °C in 80% formamide, 1 mm EDTA, 400 mm NaCl, and 50 mm PIPES, pH 6.4, to 5 μg of poly(A)+mRNA from K4DT in the presence of avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (Promega). The extended cDNA was analyzed by denaturing sequencing gel with sequencing reaction products as a marker. The putative promoter region was ligated into a reporter gene vector, pGL-3luc (Promega), atXbaI-SacI sites. A series of deletion constructs was generated either by restriction endonuclease digestion or PCR amplification of the desired portion of the insert. The minimal cyclin D1 promoter-reporter gene construct (−105), containing 4 CpG loci, was methylated in vitro by SssI (CpG) methylase (Takara, Kyoto, Japan) with 5 mm S-adenosylmethionine. Purified promoter-reporter gene constructs were transiently transfected into rat leukemia cell lines K4D, K4D16, and K4DT with Tfx™-50 reagent at a charge ratio of 1:4 according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega). Tissue samples from Long-Evans rats were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and embedded in paraffin; 4 μm-thick sections were then cut and dewaxed through xylene and a series of graded alcohols. Endogenous peroxidase activity was blocked with 3% H2O2 in methanol for 10 min. Specimens were then incubated with 2% non-fat dry milk in phosphate-buffered saline for 10 min and primary antibody against human, rat, and mouse cyclin D1 (R-124, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 30 min. After three 10-min washing with phosphate-buffered saline, specimens were incubated with rabbit anti-mouse IgG preabsorbed with non-immunized rat serum for 30 min. Finally, the cyclin D1 protein was immunolocalized by the streptavidine-biotin peroxidase complex method. Each genomic DNA, extracted and purified from normal rat fetus, various organs from adult rats, K4D, K4DT, and K4D16 cell lines, was digested with either HapII or MspI restriction enzymes and electrophoresed on 1.2% agarose gels. After transferring onto nylon membranes (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), blotted DNA was probed with 1.4 kilobases of the 5′-flanking region of the Long-Evans rat cyclin D1 gene. After washing twice in 2 × SSC containing 0.1% SDS, 1 × SSC containing 0.1% SDS and finally 0.1 × SSC containing 0.1% SDS at 60 °C, the membranes were analyzed with image analyzer BAS-EWS 4075 (FUJIX). The bisulfite reaction was carried out according to the procedures of Frommer et al. (34Frommer M. McDonald L.E. Millar D.S. Collis C.M. Watt F. Grigg G.W. Molloy P.L. Paul C.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1827-1831Crossref PubMed Scopus (2525) Google Scholar) and Olek et al. (27Olek A. Oswald J. Walter J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 5064-5066Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). A quantity of 1 μg of DNA in a volume of 50 μl of TE was denatured by NaOH (final concentration, 0.2 m) for 10 min at 37 °C. Freshly prepared 30 μl of 10 mm hydroquinine and 520 μl of 3 m sodium bisulfite at pH 5 were added to the samples. Each sample was incubated under mineral oil at 50 °C for 16 h. Modified DNA was purified with Wizard DNA purification resin according to the manufacturer's recommended protocol (Promega) and eluted into 50 μl of H2O. Modification was completed by NaOH (final concentration, 0.3 m) treatment for 5 min at room temperature, then by ethanol precipitation. DNA was resuspended in 20 μl of H2O and used immediately or stored at −20 °C. Paraffin-embedded samples were deparaffinized in xylene and buried in agarose bead and then treated with Pronase K at 50 °C for 12 h according to the method described. Bisulfite-modified DNA (100 ng) was amplified with nested PCR using the following sets of primers, 5′-GTGTTGATGAAATTGAAAGAAGTTG-3′, sense; 5′-ACTTTACAACTTCAACAAAACTCCCCTAT-3′, antisense. Each primer sequence was set not to contain the CpG loci of the rat cyclin D1 5′-flanking region. The PCR condition was as follows: 30 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 60 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 30 s, and the final elongation step for 5 min at 72 °C. The PCR mixture contained 1 × buffer (Takara) with 1.5 mm MgCl2, 20 pmol of each primer, 0.2 mm dNTPs, and bisulfite-modified DNA (50 ng) in a final volume of 50 μl. Each PCR product was loaded onto 3% agarose gels, stained with ethidium bromide, and visualized under UV illumination; the fragments were subjected to automated DNA sequencing. The sequencing reactions for the products of the PCR were carried out with a DNA sequencing kit (Perkin-Elmer) by the dideoxy nucleotide termination method using the PCR condition. Reaction products were analyzed on a 310 Genetic Analyzer (Perkin-Elmer). Among the rat leukemic cell lines, K4D16 and K4DT cells with adherence to the culture dish overexpressed the cyclin D1 gene as demonstrated by Northern blot analysis (Fig. 1 A). To analyze whether or not the cyclin D1 overexpression at the mRNA level related to its translation, cyclin D1 protein expression was checked by Western blotting; mirroring Northern blot analysis, K4D16 and K4DT expressed 5 times as much cyclin D1 protein as the original strain, K4D (Fig. 1 B). To analyze the mechanism determining the difference in the steady-state gene expression of cyclin D1 between the original K4D monocytic cell line and the subcloned K4D16 and K4DT cells, the rate of transcription in these cell lines was examined by nuclear run-on assay; K4D16 and K4DT cells transcribed 5 times as much cyclin D1 mRNA as that of K2D, K3D, and K4D while keeping the basic transcription rate for glyceraldehyde-6-phosphate dehydrogenase constant (Fig. 1 C). These results suggested that K4D16 and K4DT cells overexpressed cyclin D1 mainly at the transcriptional level. Two positive clones obtained after tertial screening were identical by the restriction map of the Southern blot analysis (data not shown). Restriction mapping of the genomic insert is shown in Fig. 3 A. A 2.4-kilobaseSacI-SacI portion of the subcloned insert contained the whole 5′-untranslated portion and part of the exon 1 region of the published rat cyclin D1 cDNA (32Tamura K. Kanaoka Y. Jinno S. Nagata A. Ogiso Y. Shimizu K. Hayakawa T. Nojima H. Okayama H. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 2113-2118PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.2, a reverse transcriptase-mediated extension of the antisense oligonucleotide primer to poly(A)+ mRNA from K4D16 yielded one major and three minor extended fragments, positioning the major transcriptional start site 99 nucleotides upstream from the initial methionine site; this was assigned the +1 position. Fig.3 B shows the part of the sequence with putative binding domains. The 5′-flanking sequence around the site of transcription initiation showed that the cyclin D1 gene lacked the canonical TATA box, but did contain two continuous Sp1-binding sites at −109 and one CRE site at −48. An additional Sp1-binding site, one octamer sequence, an E-box, and E2F-binding sites were located at −476, −209, −532, and −679, respectively. To assess the promoter activity and cis-regulatory elements, a series of deletion constructs of the 5′-flanking sequence were ligated into the PGL-3 vector. As shown in Fig. 4, unlike Northern and Western blots and nuclear run-on analysis, K4D, K4D16, and K4DT cells showed almost the same level of luciferase activity for each construct, and a 105-base pair fragment with a single Sp1 site had basic promoter activity. Methylation of minimal promoter construct (Met-105) at CpG sites by SssI, however, diminished that promoter activity to 32–36% in the three leukemic cell lines, suggesting that the difference of the transcription rate of the cyclin D1 gene was mainly an epigenetical event. On the other hand, the weak negatively regulating element was located between −825 and −615.Figure 2Rat cyclin D1 genomic sequence and mapping the sites of transcriptional initiation. Reverse transcriptase-mediated extension of the antisense oligonucleotide primer to poly(A)+ mRNA from K4D16 leukemic cell lines yielded one major (large arrow with +1) and three minor extended fragments (small arrows), positioning the major transcriptional start site 99 nucleotides upstream from the initial methionine site (assigned the +1 position).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 4Transient transfection study with a series of deletion constructs. A series of the deletion constructs were made by either restriction enzymatic digestion or PCR amplification. Unlike Northern and Western blots and nuclear run-on analysis, K4D, K4D16, and K4DT cells showed almost same level of the luciferase activity for each construct, and a 105-base pair fragment with a single Sp1 site had basic promoter activity. In the steady-state, deletion of the −825 to −615 portion increased luciferase activity by 30%, indicating the presence of a weak negatively regulating element within that portion. When minimal promoter construct (−105) was methylated bySssI at CpG sites (Met-105), luciferase activity decreased to 32–36% in all leukemic cell lines, suggesting that the difference in the transcription rate of the cyclin D1 was mainly a epigenetical event.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) As shown in Fig. 6 A, since in the 5′-flanking region of the rat cyclin D1 gene numerous CpG loci constituted a CpG island, where methylation often contributes one of the major cis-regulating elements, we further tested whether or not the transcriptional activity of the cyclin D1 gene was related to the methylation status of the CpG loci. The methylation status of the 5′-flanking region of the rat cyclin D1 gene was first surveyed by Southern blot analysis. As shown in Fig.5, HapII digestion of genomic DNA from K4D showed methylation-protected bands. Furthermore,HapII-protected bands observed in K4D were demethylated in genomic DNA from K4D16 and K4DT cells. In genomic DNA extracted from normal adult Long-Evans rats, minor HapII-protected bands were also observed in ovary and uterus (Fig. 5, arrows). To access more precise information about the methylation status including non-CpG methylated cytosine in leukemic cell lines and normal tissues, high sensitivity mapping of the methylated cytosine was carried out by sodium bisulfate modification before PCR amplification. As expected, genomic Southern blot analysis revealed that some of the methylated cytosines found in the K4D cell line were demethylated in K4D16 and K4DT cells; especially, a methylated cytosine at the CpG locus located between the two continuous Sp1-binding sites (5 in Fig.6 B) in K4D cell line was demethylated in the K4D16 and the K4DT cell lines (Fig. 6 C). Among normal rat tissues, however, the occurrence of methylated cytosines was less frequent than among rat leukemic cell lines, and partial methylation of the cytosine at non-CpG loci around two continuous Sp1-binding sites (asterisk in Fig. 6,A and B) was noted in the ovary and uterus. These results suggested that methylation of the 5′-regulatory region of the rat cyclin D1 gene was manifested not merely as an in vitroartificial event but as a"

Previous studies have demonstrated that IL-1β and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (24Pohlman T.H. Harlan J.M. Cell Immunol. 1989; 119: 41-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), like TNF-α (24Pohlman T.H. Harlan J.M.

This finding suggested that inducible or constitutive cytoprotective proteins were required for HUVEC survival during exposure to IL-1β and LPS as well as to TNF-α. The IL-1 signaling pathway is initiated by binding of IL-1 to IL-1receptor type I (IL1-R1), a member of the human Toll/IL-1 receptor family. IL-1β stimulation of cells leads to activation of the serine-threonine IL-1 receptor-associated kinase (IRAK), which is recruited to the IL-1R1 by IL-1 receptor accessory protein and the Toll domain-containing protein MyD88. Phosphorylated IRAK then dissociates from the receptor and interacts with TNF receptor-associated factor (TRAF)-6; IRAK is rapidly degraded by a proteasome-dependent pathway (26Cao Z. Xiong J. Takeuchi M. Kurama T. Goeddel D.V. Nature. 1996; 383: 443-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (1117) Google Scholar, 27Cao Z. Henzel W.J. Gao X. Science. 1996; 271: 1128-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (768) Google Scholar). MyD88, a death domain-containing protein, acts as a proximal adapter in the IL-1R signaling complex by independently interacting with IL-1 receptor accessory protein and IRAK (28Muzio M. Ni J. Feng P. Dixit V.M. Science. 1997; 278: 1612-1615Crossref PubMed Scopus (976) Google Scholar). TRAF-6 binds to NF-κB-inducing kinase (NIK) (29Malinin N.L. Boldin M.P. Kovalenko A.V. Wallach D. Nature. 1997; 385: 540-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (1160) Google Scholar), thereby linking NIK and, subsequently, IκB kinases (IKKα and IKKβ) to both IL-1- and TNF-α-induced NF-κB activation (8Stancovski I. Baltimore D. Cell. 1997; 91: 299-302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar). Stimulation of cells by LPS involves the plasma protein, LPS-binding protein, membrane-bound or soluble CD14, and a membrane-bound signaling receptor that was unknown until recently (reviewed in Ref. 30Ulevitch R.J. Tobias P.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1995; 57: 437-457Crossref Scopus (1320) Google Scholar). Two groups reported that overexpression of Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) conferred LPS responsiveness as assessed by NF-κB activation in human embryonic 293 cells (31Kirschning C.J. Wesche H. Merrill Ayres T. Rothe M. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 2091-2097Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar, 32Yang R.B. Mark M.R. Gray A. Huang A. Xie M.H. Zhang M. Goddard A. Wood W.I. Gurney A.L. Godowski P.J. Nature. 1998; 395: 284-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (1099) Google Scholar). In one of the 293 cell lines examined, overexpression of TLR1 and TLR4 did not confer LPS signaling (31Kirschning C.J. Wesche H. Merrill Ayres T. Rothe M. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 2091-2097Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar). However, mutations in the TLR4 gene were shown to produce defective LPS signaling in endotoxin-tolerant mouse strains (33Poltorak A. He X.L. Smirnova I. Liu M.Y. Van H.C. Du X. Birdwell D. Alejos E. Silva M. Galanos C. Freudenberg M. Ricciardi C.P. Layton B. Beutler B. Science. 1998; 282: 2085-2088Crossref PubMed Scopus (6401) Google Scholar, 34Qureshi S.T. Lariviere L. Leveque G. Clermont S. Moore K.J. Gros P. Malo D. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 615-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (1351) Google Scholar). Moreover, TLR4-deficient mice were also found to be hyporesponsive to LPS (35Hoshino K. Takeuchi O. Kawai T. Sanjo H. Ogawa T. Takeda Y. Takeda K. Akira S. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 3749-3752PubMed Google Scholar). Also, TLR4 (as well as TLR2) was shown to mediate LPS-induced signal transduction in another 293 cell line (36Chow J.C. Young D.W. Golenbock D.T. Christ W.J. Gusovsky F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10689-10692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1609) Google Scholar). Thus, it is clear that TLR4 is essential for LPS signaling in vivo, and there is evidence that TLR2 may play a role in some cell types in vitro. The intracellular signaling pathway by which LPS activates NF-κB in 293 cells was blocked by dominant-negative forms of MyD88, TRAF-6, NIK, IKKα, and IKKβ (31Kirschning C.J. Wesche H. Merrill Ayres T. Rothe M. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 2091-2097Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar). Recently, LPS signaling leading to activation of NF-κB in human dermal microvessel endothelial cells was also shown to signal through MyD88, IRAK, IRAK2, TRAF-6, and NIK (37Zhang F.X. Kirschning C.J.

Thus, LPS activation uses the many of the same molecules as the IL-1 system. Also, we have recently shown that LPS activation of NF-κB involves tyrosine phosphorylation of a protein(s) leading to degradation of IκBα but not IκBβ in HUVECs (38Zen K. Karsan A. Eunson T. Yee E. Harlan J.M. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 243: 425-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) and that LPS-induced endothelial cell death is dependent upon FADD, a Fas-associated protein with a death domain (39Choi K.B. Wong F. Harlan J.M. Chaudhary P.M. Hood L. Karsan A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20185-20188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Although the pathways leading to NF-κB activation have now been elucidated, those promoting HUVEC survival following stimulation by IL-1β or LPS remain undefined. To investigate the relationship between NF-κB activation and apoptosis in HUVECs, we determined whether TNF-α, IL-1β, or LPS induced cell death when activation of NF-κB was inhibited by overexpression of a dominant-negative IκBα mutant (IκBαM) using recombinant adenovirus. This study is the first to demonstrate that endothelial cell survival following stimulation by IL-1β and LPS is NF-κB-independent. HUVECs obtained from collagenase-digested umbilical veins were cultured in RPMI medium with 20% bovine calf serum (Hyclone, Logan, UT), 90 μg/ml heparin (Sigma), and endothelial cell growth factor (50 μg/ml) prepared from bovine hypothalamus. All cells were maintained at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Recombinant human TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-4, and LPS were purchased from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). Anti-IκBα antibody was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Z-Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromethylketone (zVAD-fmk) was purchased from Kamiya Biomedical Co. (Seattle, WA). The PI 3-kinase inhibitor LY294002 and the p38 kinase inhibitor SB203580 were obtained from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA). The neutralizing anti-Fas L monoclonal antibody (mAb) 4H9 was obtained from Immunotech-Coulter Corp. (Miami, FL). The IκBα mutant (S32A/S36A) cDNA was kindly provided by Drs. J. DiDonato and M. Karin (University of California, San Diego, CA) (40DiDonato J. Mercurio F. Rosette C. Wu L.J. Suyang H. Ghosh S. Karin M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1295-1304Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This cDNA was inserted into the vector pXCJL1 under the transcriptional control of the phosphoglycerokinase (PGK) promoter, upstream of the bovine growth hormone polyadenylation signal. The E1A- and partially E3-deleted recombinant adenovirus (Ad.PGK-IκBαM) was generated by the recombination of the pXCJL.1-IκBα mutant plasmid and pJM17 in 293 cells as described (41Lieber A. Vrancken-Peeters M.J. Meuse L. Fausto N. Perkins J. Kay M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6210-6214Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Recombinant adenovirus expressing a nuclear-targeted reporter enzyme (Ad.RSV-βgal) used as a control adenovirus was generated as described in a previous report (42Stratford-Perricaudet L.D. Makeh I. Perricaudet M. Briand P. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 626-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar). Purification of a large batch of the recombinant adenovirus was done by two consecutive cesium chloride centrifugations, and it was stored at −80 °C in 10% glycerol, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and 1 mm MgCl2 with a stock concentration of 1.6 × 1011 pfu/ml. Subconfluent HUVECs were washed once with warmed complete medium and incubated at a multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) indicated with control adenovirus or IκBαM adenovirus in complete medium. After 72 h at 37 °C, TNF-α, IL-1β, LPS, or IL-4 was added to the HUVECs. After experimental treatment of HUVECs, cell monolayers were detached from plastic culture dishes with a cell scraper, washed in cold phosphate-buffered saline, and incubated in 50 μl of Buffer A (10 mm Hepes, pH 8.0, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.5 mmdithiothreitol, 200 mm sucrose, 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40) for 10 min at 4 °C. The cytoplasmic protein was collected in the supernatant following microcentrifugation. The pellet was incubated in 20 μl of Buffer B (20 mm Hepes, pH 8.0, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 420 mm NaCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mmdithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 20% glycerol) for 10 min at 4 °C. The nuclear protein was collected in the supernatant following microcentrifugation and subjected to electrophoretic mobility shift assay. Cytosolic extracts from treated HUVECs were electrophoresed in 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose in 25 mm Tris, 192 mm glycine, 5% methanol at 100 V for 1 h at 4 °C. Filters were blocked overnight with TBS-T (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20) containing 5% skim milk. Immunoblots were analyzed for IκBα protein using antiserum at a 1:1000 dilution. Immunoreactive proteins were detected according to the enhanced chemiluminescence protocol (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using 1:10,000 horseradish peroxidase-linked anti-rabbit secondary antiserum. Blots were exposed to film for 1–10 min. Double-stranded oligonucleotide containing the E-selectin NF-κB site (5′-AGCTTAGAGGGGATTTCCGAGAGGA-3′) (43Montgomery K.F. Osborn L. Hession C. Tizard R.

Binding reactions in 20 μl contained 20 μg of nuclear extract protein, binding buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 20 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mmEDTA, 5% glycerol, 1 μg of single-stranded salmon testis DNA, 1 μg of poly(dI-dC)), and 100,000 cpm 32P-labeled DNA. Reactions were incubated at room temperature for 60 min and analyzed by electrophoresis on a 4% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel at 200 V for 2 h. After electrophoresis, gels were dried, and DNA-protein complex was localized by autoradiography for 18 h. TNF-α, IL-1β, LPS, or IL-4 was added to uninfected and adenovirus-infected HUVECs. After 6 h at 37 °C, cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated with 5 μg/ml of the anti-VCAM-1 monoclonal antibody (clone 4B9) conjugated with horseradish peroxidase in RPMI medium containing 2% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C for 1 h. The antibody solution was aspirated, and the cells were subsequently washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were developed using 1 mg/ml of o-phenylenediamine in 0.1 m sodium citrate, pH 4.5, with 0.01% H2O2 (v/v). Absorbance at 490 nm was measured for each well using a plate reader (Bio-Tec Instruments, Winooski, VT). TNF-α, IL-1β, LPS, or IL-4 was added to uninfected and adenovirus-infected HUVECs with or without CHX. After 24 h at 37 °C, medium was removed and replaced with medium containing 1 mg/ml 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) (Sigma) and incubated at 37 °C for 5 h. The medium was aspirated, and the formazan product was solubilized with dimethyl sulfoxide. Absorbance at 570 nm was determined for each well. Consistent with previous data (24Pohlman T.H. Harlan J.M. Cell Immunol. 1989; 119: 41-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 25Polunovsky V.A. Wendt C.H. Ingbar D.H. Peterson M.S. Bitterman P.B. Exp. Cell Res. 1994; 214: 584-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar), TNF-α, IL-1β, and LPS treatment of HUVECs induced cell death only in the presence of CHX (Fig. 1 A). This result suggests that HUVEC survival following exposure to IL-1β or LPS, as well as to TNF-α, is dependent upon synthesis of a cytoprotective protein(s). The caspase inhibitor, zVAD-fmk (44Jacobsen M.D. Weil M. Raff M.C. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 1041-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar), inhibited cell death induced by TNF-α, IL-1β, or LPS with CHX (Fig.1 B), indicating that in the presence of CHX, TNF-α, IL-1β, or LPS activates a caspase-mediated cell death pathway in HUVECs. The mechanism by which TNF-α activates caspases and induces apoptosis has been well defined, but the signaling pathway leading to apoptosis following IL-1β or LPS stimulation has not been characterized. We recently showed that overexpression of a FADD-dominant-negative construct in a human microvascular endothelial cell line protected the cells from apoptosis following co-incubation with LPS and a protein synthesis inhibitor but that a neutralizing anti-Fas antibody did not (39Choi K.B. Wong F. Harlan J.M. Chaudhary P.M. Hood L. Karsan A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20185-20188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, in other model systems, oxidized LDL-induced apoptosis of endothelial cells was blocked by neutralizing mAb to Fas ligand (FasL) (45Sata M. Walsh K. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 102: 1682-1689Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar) and IL-1-induced apoptosis of Langerhans cells (46Loweth A.C. Williams G.T. James R.-F.L. Scarpello J.-H.B. Morgan N.G.

However, blockade of the Fas-FasL apoptotic pathway by the neutralizing anti-FasL mAb, 4H9, (45Sata M. Walsh K. J. Clin.

To examine the role of NF-κB in activation of the cytoprotective pathway(s), we generated recombinant adenovirus containing an IκBαM gene with serine to alanine mutations at residues 32 and 36 (Ad.PGK-IκBαM). This mutant IκBα protein inhibits signal-induced phosphorylation and subsequent proteasome-mediated degradation of IκBα, thereby preventing translocation of NF-κB to the nucleus (40DiDonato J. Mercurio F. Rosette C. Wu L.J. Suyang H. Ghosh S. Karin M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1295-1304Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Gene transduction using recombinant adenovirus is one of the most effective strategies to express genes in HUVECs (4Wrighton C.J. Hofer W.R. Moll T. Eytner R. Bach F.H. de Martin R. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 1013-1022Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 48Hong Z. Guangbin Z. Airu Z. Jian T. Qianhui H. Guanghui C. Tongcai P. Bingquan H. Chinese Med. J. 1995; 108: 493-496PubMed Google Scholar). First, transfection efficiency of adenovirus was determined in HUVECs. An X-gal assay was performed 48 h after adding Ad.RSV-βgal to HUVECs, and efficiency of transfection was observed to be 100% at 1000 m.o.i. of recombinant adenovirus (data not shown). Next, we determined whether overexpression of the IκBαM inhibited NF-κB activation and IκBα degradation. Gel mobility shift experiments with the E-selectin-κB site as the probe showed that Ad.RSV-βgal-infected cells, as well as uninfected cells, exhibited strong induction of NF-κB after TNF-α treatment, whereas κB binding activity was not observed in the IκBαM-expressing cells (Fig.3 A). Similar inhibition of NF-κB binding activity was observed in Ad.PGK-IκBM-transduced HUVECs treated with IL-1β or LPS (data not shown). Immunoblot analysis confirmed that TNF-α, IL-1β, or LPS induced IκBα degradation in control adenovirus-infected HUVECs, but overexpressed IκBαM was not degraded following stimulation by TNF-α, IL-1β, or LPS (Fig. 3 B), presumably because it was not phosphorylated. Finally, we tested whether expression of IκBαM regulated VCAM-1 protein expression, as TNF-α-induced VCAM-1 expression is known to be dependent upon NF-κB activation (3Read M.A. Neish A.S.

Bach F.H. de Martin R. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 1013-1022Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4, the induction of VCAM-1 protein expression by TNF-α, IL-1β, or LPS was suppressed in IκBαM-expressing cells. Infection with Ad.PGK-IκBαM did not inhibit IL-4-induced VCAM-1 expression, consistent with the previous report that IL-4 induction of VCAM-1 expression is NF-κB-independent (49McCarty J.M. Yee E.K.

HUVECs were infected with 1000 m.o.i. of Ad.RSV-βgal or Ad.PGK-IκBαM for 72 h. VCAM-1 protein expression was examined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay after 6 h incubation with the indicated concentrations of TNF-α, IL-1β, LPS, or IL-4.

Therefore, we tested this cell line in our assay. X-gal stained almost all of the HT1080 cells at 500 m.o.i. of Ad.RSV-βgal at 48 h after infection of cells (data not shown). As reported (19Wang C.Y. Mayo M.W. Baldwin A.S.J. Science. 1996; 274: 784-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (2505) Google Scholar), TNF-α induced cell death in IκBαM-expressing HT1080 cells infected by the recombinant adenovirus (Fig. 5 A). As shown in Fig. 5 B, TNF-α also induced apoptosis in IκBαM-expressing HUVECs, consistent with results of Bach et al. (20Bach F.H. Ferran C. Soares M. Wrighton C.J. Anrather J. Winkler H. Robson S.C. Hancock W.W. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 944-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) in porcine aortic endothelial cells. Notably, neither IL-1β nor LPS induced cell death in the IκBαM-expressing HUVECs. Although inhibition of VCAM-1 protein level was dependent upon the m.o.i. of recombinant adenovirus, cell viability with IL-1β and LPS treatment was unaffected at all m.o.i. levels tested (Fig. 6). It has been reported that IL-1 activation may involve the PI 3-kinase and p38 MAP kinase signaling pathways (50Geng Y. Valbracht J. Lotz M. J. Clin.

We report here that prostaglandin E2(PGE2), one of the major prostaglandins produced in the brain, acts as a potent and selective inhibitor of tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) production in lipopolysaccharide-stimulated primary microglia and the microglial cell line BV-2. The IC50 for this effect is 1 nm, and 100 nm PGE2 suppresses TNF-α production by >95%. More detailed studies of BV-2 cells show that PGE2also prevents the secretion of interleukin (IL)-6 but does not significantly modify lipopolysaccharide-stimulated expression of cyclooxygenase-2, pro-IL-1β, or inducible nitric oxide synthase. PGE2 appears to act primarily at the level of translation or protein stability, because TNF-α and IL-6 mRNA levels were only modestly decreased at high PGE2 concentrations; concomitantly with this inhibition, PGE2 up-regulated the levels of IL-1β mRNA. The effects of PGE2 could be largely mimicked by 8-bromo-cAMP, suggesting that, as in other cell types, PGE2 action is mediated at least in part by a rise in intracellular cyclic AMP. However, the protein kinase A inhibitor H89 only partially reversed the inhibition of TNF-α production by PGE2, implying that the PGE2 effect in BV-2 cells is mediated through both protein kinase A-dependent and -independent pathways.

The goal of this study was to determine how prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), one of the major prostaglandins produced in the brain, affects the production of activation-related molecules in microglia. We studied the proteins produced both at early (TNF-α and IL-1β) and later (IL-6, iNOS, COX-2) stages of microglial activation in vitro, and we report here that PGE2 acts as a potent and selective inhibitor of TNF-α and IL-6 production. The mechanism of this inhibition and the role of cAMP were also investigated. PGE2 was purchased from Cayman Chemical (Ann Arbor, MI) and prepared from powder as ethanol solutions. Bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from Salmonella typhimurium (Sigma; l-2622) was resuspended in sterile phosphate-buffered saline at 10 mg/ml and stored at −20 °C. Mouse macrophage-colony stimulating factor (R&D Systems) was dissolved in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin (Sigma) to make a 20 μg/ml stock solution and stored in aliquots at −80 °C. H89 (Alexis) and 8-bromo-cAMP (Sigma) were prepared as 25 and 100 mm stock solutions, respectively, in sterile distilled water and stored in aliquots at −20 °C. Primary rat microglia were prepared and maintained as described elsewhere (11Petrova T.V. Akama K.T. Van Eldik L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4668-4673Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). The purity of microglial cultures was assessed using OX42 antibody (Serotec Inc., Raleigh, NC). and >95% of cells stained positively. After shake-off, cells were cultured for 2 days before treatment with LPS and prostaglandins. Immediately before treatment, serum-containing medium was removed, cells were washed two times with warm α-minimum Eagle's medium, and then α-minimum Eagle's medium containing N2 supplements (Life Technologies, Inc.) and 10 ng/ml macrophage-colony stimulating factor were added. BV-2 (a murine microglial cell line generously provided by Dr. Michael McKinney; Mayo Clinic, Jacksonville, FL) cells were cultured in α-minimum Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Cells were washed twice with warm α-minimum Eagle's medium and then treated in serum-free medium. In all experiments, cells were pre-treated with PGE2 or 8-bromo-cAMP for 30 min before the addition of LPS. PGE2 was added to cells as an ethanol solution, with the final concentration of ethanol never exceeding 0.1%. Control samples contained the same concentration of diluent as experimental samples. This concentration of ethanol did not have any influence on cell viability or responses to LPS. Microglia were plated at 1 × 105 cells/well in 4-well chamber slides (Falcon). For immunostaining, cells were washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline, fixed in 4% formaldehyde (Tousimis; Rockville, MD) for 10 min, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 5 min, and blocked with 10% normal donkey serum for 30 min. Slides were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with goat anti-rat IL-1β (R&D Systems) primary antibody at a 1:200 dilution, washed, and then incubated for 30 min with fluorescein isothiocyanite-labeled donkey anti-goat IgG secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch) at a 1:400 dilution in the presence of 10% normal donkey serum. Slides were mounted and viewed with a Zeiss Axioplan microscope. No punctate staining or very weak punctate staining of microglial cells was observed when goat anti-rat TNF-α antibodies were used instead of goat anti-rat IL-1β. The lack of TNF-α staining is most likely because this cytokine is rapidly secreted from microglial cells, and the immunofluorescence method is not sensitive enough to detect the low levels of remaining intracellular and membrane-bound TNF-α protein. The absence of TNF-α staining provides a specificity control for the immunofluorescence method. BV-2 cells were pre-treated with 5 μm H89 or control buffer for 30 min and then stimulated with 1 μm PGE2 or vehicle for 3 min. Protein kinase A activity was determined in digitonin-permeabilized cells as described previously (12Verheijen M.H. Defize L.H. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 3331-3337Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), except that cells were plated at 5 × 104 cells/well in 48-well plates and grown for 2 days before assay. TNF-α and IL-1β levels in cell conditioned media were determined using Duo-Set TNF-α and IL-1β kits (Genzyme) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cell lysates were prepared, and Western blotting was performed as described previously (11Petrova T.V. Akama K.T. Van Eldik L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4668-4673Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar) using the LumiGlo®chemiluminescence detection system (New England BioLabs). To determine IL-6 levels, bovine serum albumin was added to 300–400 μl of conditioned media to a final concentration of 0.2 mg/ml, and proteins were precipitated in 5% trichloroacetic acid. After a 5-min incubation on ice, precipitates were recovered by centrifugation for 5 min at 12,000 rpm at 4 °C, and pellets were dissolved in 40 μl of 0.1m Trizma base. Aliquots were saved for determination of protein concentration, and the levels of IL-6 in the samples were determined by Western blotting. IL-6, pro-IL-1β, iNOS, and COX-2 protein levels were determined by Western blotting using the following antibodies: goat anti-mouse IL-6 (R&D Systems), rabbit anti-mouse IL-1β (Genzyme), monoclonal anti-murine mac-NOS (Transduction Laboratories), and goat anti-human COX-2 (Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz). All primary antibody dilutions were 1:1000. Secondary goat anti-rabbit, goat anti-mouse, and rabbit anti-goat antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Jackson ImmunoResearch) were used at 1:5000 (goat anti-rabbit and rabbit anti-goat) and 1:2000 (goat anti-mouse) dilutions. IL-1β cDNA probe was described previously (13Hu J. Akama K.T. Krafft G.A. Chromy B.A. Van Eldik L.J. Brain Res. 1998; 785: 195-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Partial cDNA fragments of TNF-α (692 base pairs; nucleotides 1–692; Ref. 14Estler H.C. Grewe M. Gaussling R. Pavlovic M. Decker K. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1992; 373: 271-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) and IL-6 (446 base pairs; nucleotides 134–581; Ref. 15Northemann W. Braciak T.A. Hattori M. Lee F. Fey G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 16072-16082Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were prepared by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (first-strand cDNA synthesis by SuperScript II, Life Technologies, Inc.) from rat astrocyte total RNA. We used the following polymerase chain reaction primers: (a) TNF-α(For), 5′-ATGAGCACAGAAACGATGATCCGC-3′; (b) TNF-α(Rev), 5′-CCAAAGTAGACCTGCCCGGACTC-3′ (CLONTECH Laboratories, Inc.); (c) IL-6(For), 5′-GCCTTCCCTACTTCACAAGTCCGG-3′; and (d) IL-6(Rev), 5′-GCATTGGAAGTTGGGGTAGGAAGG-3′ (Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc). Amplified products (AmpliTaq; Perkin-Elmer) were TA-cloned into pCR2.1 (Invitrogen), and the insert sequences were verified by DNA sequence analysis (Dye Terminator Cycle Sequencing; ABI Prism, PE Applied Biosystems). The partial cDNA constructs were identified as pCR(r)TNF-α (1–692) and pCR(r)IL-6(134–581). TheEcoRI digest fragments of these constructs were gel-purified and labeled with [α-32P]dCTP (Redi-Prime; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for Northern blot analysis. Total RNA was isolated from the cells, and Northern blots were performed as described previously (13Hu J. Akama K.T. Krafft G.A. Chromy B.A. Van Eldik L.J. Brain Res. 1998; 785: 195-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Equal loading of RNA was verified by stripping the membranes and reprobing with rat pTRI-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase probe (Ambion, Austin, TX). Statistics have been calculated using Student'st test with significance established at a level ofp < 0.05. Primary microglia show a strong increase in TNF-α production at 3 h after stimulation with LPS, whereas pre-treatment with 1 μm PGE2 significantly inhibited production of this cytokine (Fig.1 A). To examine the generality of this response, we tested whether the production of another pro-inflammatory cytokine, IL-1β, was affected by PGE2. The levels of IL-1β were detected by immunostaining and Western blotting, based on previous findings that IL-1β in activated microglia, unlike TNF-α, remains primarily cell-associated (16Lee S.C. Liu W. Dickson D.W. Brosnan C.F. Berman J.W. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 2659-2667PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast to TNF-α, levels of IL-1β were not affected by treatment with PGE2 (Fig. 1 B); on the contrary, PGE2 even seemed to stimulate the production of IL-1β somewhat. The murine microglial cell line BV-2 was shown to reproduce many microglial responses in culture and has been used as a model microglial system in other studies (17Du Yan S. Zhu H. Fu J. Yan S.F. Roher A. Tourtellotte W.W. Rajavashisth T. Chen X. Godman G.C. Stern D. Schmidt A.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5296-5301Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar, 18Murphy Jr., G.M. Yang L. Cordell B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20967-22071Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Stimulation of BV-2 cells with LPS leads to a robust increase of TNF-α levels in the cell-conditioned media, which becomes evident by 3 h and reaches a maximum by 6 h (data not shown). Pre-treatment of BV-2 cells with PGE2 inhibited LPS-induced TNF-α production in a dose-dependent manner, with an IC50 of ∼1 nm (Fig.2 A). Treatment of BV-2 cells with PGE2 also prevented LPS-stimulated accumulation of another cytokine, IL-6, 18–24 h after the addition of LPS (Fig.2 B). We tested the influence of PGE2 on the production of other activation-related cytokines or enzymes in BV-2 cells. Stimulation of BV-2 cells with LPS leads to a strong increase in the production of cell-associated pro-IL-1β, COX-2, and iNOS (Fig.3). Although BV-2 cells produced high amounts of pro-IL-1β, processed IL-1β was not detected in conditioned medium by ELISA, even at later time points (data not shown). PGE2 treatment did not inhibit LPS-induced pro-IL-1β or COX-2 and only weakly blocked (∼50% inhibition) iNOS induction (Fig. 3). In addition, in the case of weak inhibition of iNOS, even high concentrations of PGE2 (up to 10 μm) were unable to further suppress the production of this protein or the production of NO as measured by the accumulation of nitrite in the conditioned media (11Petrova T.V. Akama K.T. Van Eldik L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4668-4673Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). These data demonstrate that the action of PGE2 in BV-2 microglia is highly selective, inhibiting TNF-α and IL-6 but not IL-1β, COX-2, or iNOS. We have investigated at what level the inhibition of TNF-α and IL-6 may occur in BV-2 cells. Stimulation with LPS leads to ∼20-fold increase in TNF-α mRNA compared with control; pre-treatment with 1 μm PGE2 results in a 40% decrease in LPS-induced TNF-α mRNA levels (Fig.4). Although a small decrease in TNF-α mRNA was also observed in cells treated with lower doses (100 and 1 nm) of PGE2, these differences did not reach statistically significant levels (Fig. 4). IL-6 mRNA accumulation was affected by PGE2 in the same way as TNF-α mRNA,i.e., IL-6 mRNA was decreased by ∼50% by 1 μm PGE2 and only weakly decreased at lower concentrations of the prostaglandin (Fig. 4). The ∼40–50% inhibition of TNF-α and IL-6 mRNA by high concentrations of PGE2 was evident at all time points examined (data not shown). The modest inhibition of TNF-α and IL-6 mRNA levels is in striking contrast to the strong inhibition observed on the protein level, i.e. 1 μm, 100 nm, and 1 nm PGE2 inhibit TNF-α protein production by 99%, 95%, and 50%, respectively, and IL-6 protein levels are affected in a similar way. While inhibiting TNF-α and IL-6 mRNA accumulation, PGE2 treatment increased the production of IL-1β mRNA (Fig. 4), demonstrating that PGE2 has a differential effect on the mRNA accumulation of these cytokines. IL-1β mRNA levels were ∼2.5-fold higher in cells treated with LPS in the presence of 1 μm PGE2 in comparison with cells treated with LPS alone (Fig. 4). The effect of PGE2 on cells can be modulated by four subtypes of prostanoid receptors, EP1–EP4, with EP2 and EP4 receptors positively coupled to adenylate cyclase (19Negishi M. Sugimoto Y. Ichikawa A. J. Lipid Mediat. Cell Signal. 1995; 12: 379-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). A recent study (20Caggiano A.O. Kraig R.P. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 565-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) has shown that in microglial cells, the effects of PGE2 are mediated by the EP2 subtype, thus implicating the importance of a rise in intracellular cAMP for the activity of PGE2 in microglia. In agreement with these data, we found that the activity of PGE2 can be largely mimicked by a cAMP analog, 8-bromo-cAMP. Indeed, pre-treatment of BV-2 cells with 8-bromo-cAMP for 30 min completely abolished the LPS-induced accumulation of TNF-α and IL-6 proteins, whereas the production of pro-IL-1β was not affected, and iNOS was only weakly inhibited (Fig.5). Unlike PGE2, however, 8-bromo-cAMP significantly inhibited COX-2 production (Fig. 5). We also investigated whether PKA mediates PGE2 effects in BV-2 cells. Pre-treatment with the PKA-selective inhibitor H89 (21Chijiwa T. Mishima A. Hagiwara M. Sano M. Hayashi K. Inoue T. Naito K. Toshioka T. Hidaka H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5267-5272Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) only partially reversed the PGE2 inhibition of TNF-α (Fig. 6 A). At the same time, this concentration of H89 almost completely inhibited PGE2-induced activation of PKA (Fig. 6 B). These data suggest that although activation of PKA by PGE2 may represent one of the important steps in the action of PGE2in microglia, PKA-independent pathways are also likely to be involved. This study addresses the question of how PGE2, one of the major prostaglandins produced in the brain, influences microglial activation. Here we report for the first time that in LPS-stimulated BV-2 microglial cells, PGE2 selectively suppresses the production of TNF-α and IL-6, whereas it has little or no effect on the accumulation of other activation-related proteins, such as pro-IL-1β, iNOS, or COX-2. These results demonstrate the potential for modulation of specific signal transduction pathways in activated glia and provide a precedent for future attempts to develop selective therapeutics for neurodegenerative diseases in which glial activation and inflammatory responses are directly linked to neuropathology. Suppression of TNF-α production by PGE2 in peripheral macrophages is a well-described process; PGE2 acts primarily by suppressing TNF-α transcription (22Kunkel S.L. Spengler M. May M.A. Spengler R. Larrick J. Remick D. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 5380-5384Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Based on our data, it appears that transcriptional suppression is not the mechanism in microglia, or at least in the BV-2 microglial cell line. Despite the complete inhibition of TNF-α and IL-6 protein production, PGE2 at high concentrations decreased the TNF-α and IL-6 mRNA levels by only 40–50%. These data suggest that PGE2, in addition to the modest effect on TNF-α and IL-6 mRNA accumulation at high concentrations, acts principally by regulating protein accumulation at the level of translation or protein stability. The production of TNF-α in LPS-stimulated macrophages and microglia has been shown to be regulated both at the level of transcription and translation, with p38, extracellular signal regulated kinase 1/2, and c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase being implicated in the translational control (23Swantek J.L. Cobb M.H. Geppert T.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6274-6282Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Bhat N.R. Zhang P. Lee J.C. Hogan E.L. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 1633-1641Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, the suppression of IL-6 accumulation by PGE2 in BV-2 cells was significant only at later time points, when the viability of LPS-treated cells is impaired (11Petrova T.V. Akama K.T. Van Eldik L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4668-4673Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar), thus suggesting that the action of PGE2 on IL-6 production may be mediated indirectly through a cytoprotective effect rather than a direct regulation of IL-6 protein synthesis. As in other cell systems, PGE2 appears to act by increasing intracellular cAMP levels, because the cAMP-mimicking agent, 8-bromo-cAMP, has the same effect as PGE2 on TNF-α and IL-6 production. PGE2 also rapidly activates PKA in BV-2 cells, and the selective inhibitor of protein kinase A, H89, partially reversed the inhibitory action of PGE2 on TNF-α production. Nevertheless, the modest effect of PKA inhibition on the TNF-α levels suggests that additional pathways are likely to be involved. Recently, two new guanine-nucleotide-exchange factors that bind cAMP directly were described (25de Rooij J. Zwartkruis F.J. Verheijen M.H. Cool R.H. Nijman S.M. Wittinghofer A. Bos J.L. Nature. 1998; 396: 474-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (1594) Google Scholar, 26Kawasaki H. Springett G.M. Mochizuki N. Toki S. Nakaya M. Matsuda M. Housman D.E. Graybiel A.M. Science. 1998; 282: 2275-2279Crossref PubMed Scopus (1158) Google Scholar). The binding of cAMP to these factors leads to the activation of the small GTPase Rap1 that is abundantly expressed in the brain (26Kawasaki H. Springett G.M. Mochizuki N. Toki S. Nakaya M. Matsuda M. Housman D.E. Graybiel A.M. Science. 1998; 282: 2275-2279Crossref PubMed Scopus (1158) Google Scholar). One could speculate that PGE2 stimulation of microglia might affect the production of some cytokines through modulation of Rap1 activity; however, additional studies are necessary to evaluate this and other possibilities. PGE2 has been reported to inhibit iNOS (27Minghetti L. Nicolini A. Polazzi E. Creminon C. Maclouf J. Levi G. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1997; 433: 181-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) and IL-1β (28Caggiano A.O. Kraig R.P. J. Neurochem. 1998; 70: 2357-2368Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) production in LPS-stimulated rat microglia. In agreement with the former study (27Minghetti L. Nicolini A. Polazzi E. Creminon C. Maclouf J. Levi G. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1997; 433: 181-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) that found ∼40% inhibition of iNOS, we also observed partial (∼30–50%) inhibition of NO production (11Petrova T.V. Akama K.T. Van Eldik L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4668-4673Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar) and iNOS protein (this study) by PGE2 in BV-2 cells. However, in contrast to the latter study (28Caggiano A.O. Kraig R.P. J. Neurochem. 1998; 70: 2357-2368Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), we detected no changes in LPS-induced pro-IL-1β accumulation in BV-2 cells. Our findings on the protein level in BV-2 cells are substantiated by the fact that PGE2 increased IL-1β mRNA levels in BV-2 cells, thus demonstrating an opposite effect of PGE2 on the production of mRNA for pro-inflammatory cytokines. In rat primary microglia, we also did not observe inhibition of IL-1β production at a 3 h time point; however, the small number of microglial cells available precluded a detailed time course analysis of the IL-1β expression pattern. Clearly, more detailed investigation of PGE2action in primary microglia, including future comparative studies on human microglia, is needed to clarify this apparent discrepancy. Overall, our data demonstrate that PGE2 is a potent and selective inhibitor of TNF-α and IL-6 production in activated BV-2 cells and that the mechanism of PGE2 action is primarily post-transcriptional, perhaps at the level of translation or protein stability. We have previously shown that a cyclopentanone derivative of prostaglandin D2, 15-deoxy-Δ12,14-PGJ2, acts as an inhibitor of iNOS transcription in activated glia (11Petrova T.V. Akama K.T. Van Eldik L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4668-4673Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Our additional studies 2T. V. Petrova, manuscript in preparation. indicate that cyclopentanone prostaglandins also inhibit the production of TNF-α, COX-2, IL-6, and IL-1β. Taken together, these data suggest that there is a remarkable specificity and complexity in the effects of prostaglandins that matches the complexity of responses of glia to activating stimuli and that prostaglandins may play the role of both fine-tuning agents (PGE2) and general inhibitors of glial activation (cyclopentanone prostaglandins). TNF-α and IL-6 appear to play a dual role in brain injury and neurodegeneration that can include both neurotrophic and neurotoxic effects. For example, increased levels of TNF-α and IL-6 are observed after acute brain insult, such as stroke, in AIDS dementia, and in a number of neurodegenerative diseases, such as multiple sclerosis, Parkinson disease, and Alzheimer's disease (reviewed in Refs. 29Gruol D.L. Nelson T.E. Mol. Neurobiol. 1997; 15: 307-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar and30Munoz-Fernandez M.A. Fresno M. Prog. Neurobiol. 1998; 56: 307-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). IL-6 was shown to promote neuronal survival and protect select populations of neurons againstN-methyl-d-aspartate-induced cell death bothin vivo and in vitro (31Toulmond S. Vige X. Fage D. Benavides J. Neurosci. Lett. 1992; 144: 49-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 32Yamada M. Hatanaka H. Brain Res. 1994; 643: 173-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar); on the other hand, mice deficient in IL-6 are less susceptible to experimental allergic encephalitis (33Samoilova E.B. Horton J.L. Hilliard B. Liu T.S. Chen Y. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 6480-6486PubMed Google Scholar, 34Mendel I. Katz A. Kozak N. Ben-Nun A. Revel M. Eur. J.

Abraham C.R. Masliah E. Kemper P. Inglis J.D. Oldstone M.B. Mucke L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10061-10065Crossref PubMed Scopus (862) Google Scholar). With regard to TNF-α, some studies suggest a neurotoxic role for TNF-α (30Munoz-Fernandez M.A. Fresno M. Prog. Neurobiol. 1998; 56: 307-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar), whereas recent data indicate that it might also have a neuroprotective function. For example, stimulation of neuronal nuclear factor κB by TNF-α protects neurons against β amyloid-induced cell death (38Barger S.W. Horster D. Furukawa K. Goodman Y. Krieglstein J. Mattson M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9328-9332Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar), and TNF-α receptor-deficient mice demonstrate diminished microglial activation and exacerbated neuronal damage after focal cerebral ischemia and epilepsy (39Gary D.S. Bruce-Keller A.J. Kindy M.S. Mattson M.P. J. Cereb. Blood Flow Metab. 1998; 18: 1283-1287Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 40Bruce A.J. Boling W. Kindy M.S. Peschon J. Kraemer P.J. Carpenter M.K. Holtsberg F.W. Mattson M.P. Nat. Med. 1996; 2: 788-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (837) Google Scholar). It is tempting to speculate that PGE2 in some circumstances might be detrimental to neuronal survival in vivo by inhibiting TNF-α and IL-6 production by activated microglia, and that in this context, inhibition of PGE2 production by nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs would prove beneficial. PGE2 has been shown to play multiple roles in the central nervous system such as mediation of nociception, induction of fever, and regulation of blood flow (reviewed in Refs. 10Kaufmann W.E. Andreasson K.I. Isakson P.C. Worley P.F. Prostaglandins. 1997; 54: 601-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar and 41Minghetti L. Levi G. Prog. Neurobiol. 1998; 54: 99-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar). The implications of our findings of differential effects of PGE2 on the production of cytokines and inflammation-related enzymes in microglial cells are that in addition to the “traditional” functions, glia- or neuron-derived PGE2 may profoundly affect the responses of microglia to activating stimuli by modifying a panel of cytokines produced by microglia. It is likely that TNF-α and IL-6 are not the only proteins in activated microglia whose production is affected by PGE2; however, the notion of selective modification by prostaglandins of glial responses to activation deserves serious attention and more detailed investigation because it may provide a rationale for the development of treatments of neurodegenerative diseases in which glial activation is considered to be a pathological component. We thank Dr. L. Guo for assistance with the astrocyte cultures and E. Herbert for participation in the preparation of the IL-6 cDNA probe."
https://openalex.org/W2331734181,"The breast cancer susceptibility gene BRCA2 is expressed in a wide range of tissues as an 11-kb mRNA transcript that encodes a 3418-amino acid protein involved in the response to DNA damage. To obtain better a molecular characterization of BRCA2 expression in sporadic breast cancer, we quantified BRCA2 mRNA by means of RT - PCR in a large series of human primary breast tumours. BRCA2 expression showed wide variations in tumour tissues, being underexpressed in 14/127 (11%) and overexpressed in 25/127 (20%). BRCA2 overexpression (but not underexpression) correlated significantly with Scarff, Bloom and Richardson (SBR) histopathological grade III (P=0.007) and was mainly attributed to nuclear polymorphism (P=0.005) and mitotic index (P=0.048), suggesting that the BRCA2 gene contributes to the proliferation rate in breast tumours. BRCA2 status (under and/or overexpression versus normal expression) was not associated with subsequent relapse and with significantly shorter disease-free survival. The observed disruption of BRCA2 expression is not due to allelic loss, because the latter did not correlate with altered BRCA2 mRNA expression in our tumour series. Taken together, these data suggest the involvement, especially by overexpression, of the BRCA2 gene in sporadic breast tumours, and the existence of another important tumour-suppressor gene in breast cancer, in the 13q12-q13 region."

GLN deprivation caused rapid elevation of GADD45 andGADD153/CHOP mRNA levels in cells that were highly dependent upon GLN for growth and viability. BothGADD mRNAs were rapidly elevated up to several hundred-fold. In contrast, GRP78 expression was elevated by no more than 4-fold by GLN deprivation. The magnitude ofGADD up-regulation roughly correlated with the extent of GLN dependence of each cell line. The levels of all three mRNAs were responsive to alterations of ambient GLN content in a physiologically relevant concentration range that corresponded to the affinities of cellular GLN transporters. Provision of GLN-derived metabolites partially inhibited the induction of GADDexpression in GLN-deprived cells. Nuclear run-on assays and mRNA decay studies suggested that the primary mechanism leading to increasedGADD mRNA levels was not transcriptional, but rather that GADD45 and GADD153/CHOPexpression were up-regulated in response to GLN deprivation via marked stabilization of these mRNAs.

GRP78 expression is induced by glucose deprivation or any treatment that causes the accumulation of unfolded or malfolded proteins in the ER (20Wooden S.K. Li L.J. Navarro D. Qadri I. Pereira L.

Nature. 1988; 332: 462-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (965) Google Scholar). In fact, many treatments that lead to GRP78 expression (inhibition of protein glycosylation, glucose deprivation, and hypoxia) also induceGADD153 expression (16Wang X.Z. Lawson B. Brewer J.W.

Jousse C. Wang X.Z. Ron D. Ferrara M. Fafournoux P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17588-17593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). In addition, GADD153promoter activity was induced by starvation for both essential and nonessential amino acids (24Bruhat A. Jousse C. Wang X.Z. Ron D. Ferrara M. Fafournoux P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17588-17593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). In contrast, little is known of what effects nutrient availability has on GADD45 expression. The amino acid GLN is a key regulator of cellular proliferation and survival, but there is no information regarding the mechanism by which GLN exerts this effect. In an attempt to gain insight into this phenomenon, we examined the expression of GADD45,GADD153, and GRP78 in subconfluent cultures of human breast cell lines subjected to acute GLN deprivation. The data presented here demonstrate that both GADD153 andGADD45 expression is controlled by GLN availability primarily through mRNA stabilization. Thus, GLN elicits a distinct molecular response, destabilization of GADD mRNAs. This response was particularly pronounced for GADD45 mRNA. Moreover, in a series of human breast cell lines, there is a direct correlation between the response of GADD mRNA expression to GLN deprivation and the GLN dependence of proliferation. The results suggest that the antiproliferative response to GLN starvation may involve induction of GADD45 and/or GADD153expression by a mechanism that includes stabilization of this mRNA. This represents the first report of a potential molecular mechanism for the antiproliferative effects of glutamine deprivation.DISCUSSIONThe data presented here describe a rapid and pronounced response to GLN starvation; namely, the induction of GADD45 andGADD153 mRNA expression. This response was particularly acute in two human breast cell lines (HBL100 and TSE), which exhibit relatively high rates of GLN utilization and extreme dependence upon GLN for growth and viability (25Collins C.L. Wasa M. Souba W.W. Abcouwer S.F. J. Cell. Physiol. 1998; 176: 166-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). HBL100 cells were originally obtained from a mother's milk shortly after giving birth (31Gaffney E. Polanowski F.P. Blackburn S.E. Lambiase J.P. Cell Tissue Res. 1976; 172: 269-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). This cell line is considered to be untransformed but can become tumorigenic during extensive in vitro culturing (32Dhaliwal M.K. Giovanella B.C. Pathak S. Anticancer Res. 1990; 10: 113-118PubMed Google Scholar). TSE cells were derived from the tumor of a ductal adenocarcinoma patient. TSE cells exhibit an epitheliod morphology and form tumors in athymic nude mice (data not shown). The induction of GADD45 andGADD153 mRNA expression was lesser in breast cell lines that are less GLN-dependent. In general, the half-maximal inductions roughly coincided with GLN dependences for growth and GLN transporter affinities (Table I). This suggests that this response coincides with diminished GLN influx or, conceivably, a lack of GLN transporter occupancy. However, the results with TSE.06 cells suggest that transporter affinity does not determine the GLN concentration at which the response is half-maximal. TSE.06 cells exhibit very little GLN-dependence for growth but retain a GLN-transporter affinity that is not very different from that of the highly GLN-dependent parental TSE cells. The Km of the ASC GLN transporter expressed by TSE.06 cells was determined to be 0.19 mm, whereas that of the parental TSE cells is 0.39 mm. In contrast, adaptation to growth in low-GLN medium caused the GLN ED50 for growth to be reduced by 10-fold in TSE.06 cells compared with parental TSE cells. Consequently, the half-maximal induction of GADD45 andGADD153 expression in TSE.06 cells was observed at approximately 0.06 mm GLN (Table I). By comparison with TSE cells, the induction of GADD mRNA expression by TSE.06 cells might be expected to be half-maximal at 0.3 or 0.4 mmif the GLN transporter affinity determined this response. In addition, the extent of GADD mRNA inductions are reduced by more than 1 order of magnitude in TSE.06 cells compared with the parent line.Whether the up-regulation of GADD45 and/orGADD153 plays any causal role in the growth arrest of cell death that results when HBL100 and TSE cells are deprived of GLN has yet to be tested. There are indications that these GADD45and C/EBP-homologous proteins possess directly antiproliferative or apoptotic functions. Several previous studies have implicatedGADD45 expression in the mechanism of growth arrest triggered by p53 expression (2Kastan M.B. Zhan Q. el-Deiry W.S. Carrier F. Jacks T. Walsh W.V.

Chem. 1994; 269: 32672-32677Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). GADD153expression has also been implicated in growth arrest and apoptosis (4Barone M.V. Crozat A. Tabaee A. Philipson L. Ron D. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 453-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar,11Chen C. Nussenzweig A. Guo M. Kim D. Li G.C. Ling C.C. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 1659-1665PubMed Google Scholar, 12Matsumoto M. Minami M. Takeda K. Sakao Y. Akira S. FEBS Lett. 1996; 395: 143-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Conversely, GADD45 and/or GADD153 could possess functions analogous to traditional stress-response genes, serving to protect cells from stress-induced damage and/or aiding the recovery of normal cellular functions following stress. Indeed, growth arrest could itself serve as a protective mechanism, by conserving energy and halting DNA synthesis in a time of glutamine scarcity.The effect of GLN deprivation on the expression of another stress-response gene, GRP78, was also examined. In contrast to GADD45 and GADD153 mRNA, GRP78mRNA levels were increased only marginally in GLN-starved cells. This was surprising, given that many genotoxic agents that induceGADD153 expression have comparable effects onGRP78 expression (23Price B.D. Calderwood S.K. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 3814-3817PubMed Google Scholar, 33Outinen P.A. Sood S.K. Liaw P.C. Sarge K.D. Maeda N. Hirsh J. Ribau J. Podor T.J. Weitz J.I. Austin R.C. Biochem.

Cell Stress Chaperones. 1997; 2: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In particular,GADD153 and GRP78 are expressed in response to agents that interfere with glycoprotein expression, an observation that led to the conclusion that both genes respond primarily to ER stress (16Wang X.Z. Lawson B. Brewer J.W. Zinszner H. Sanjay A. Mi L.J. Boorstein R. Kreibich G. Hendershot L.M. Ron D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4273-4280Crossref PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar). Moreover, exogenous expression of GRP78/BiP depressed the induction of GADD153 expression in response to several agents that cause ER stress as well as methyl methanesulfonate, an agent thought to induce GADD153 expression by causing DNA damage (16Wang X.Z. Lawson B. Brewer J.W. Zinszner H. Sanjay A. Mi L.J. Boorstein R. Kreibich G. Hendershot L.M. Ron D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4273-4280Crossref PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar).GADD153 expression is induced by deprivation of cells with several amino acids. Marten et al. (35Marten N.W. Burke E.J. Hayden J.M. Straus D.S. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 538-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) demonstrated the induction of GADD153 mRNA levels in rat hepatoma cells by deprivation of phenylalanine, methionine, leucine, and tryptophan. In these cells, tryptophan deprivation caused the greatest induction, which was approximately 40-fold. Bruhat et al. (24Bruhat A. Jousse C. Wang X.Z. Ron D. Ferrara M. Fafournoux P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17588-17593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar) demonstrated that leucine starvation caused a 30-fold up-regulation ofGADD153 expression in HeLa, HepG2, and Caco-2 cells. These authors also demonstrated that deprivation of several amino acids caused GADD153 promoter activity to be increased by up to 8-fold in reporter-transfected HeLa cells. GLN deprivation causedGADD153 promoter activity to be increased by approximately 3-fold. This is consistent with the run-on transcription results (Fig.4), which demonstrated that GLN increased transcription of theGADD153 gene in TSE cells by a similar amount. Likewise,GADD45 and GRP78 transcription were increased by 4- and 2-fold, respectively. Thus the marked increase inGADD45 and GADD153 mRNA levels could not be solely attributed to increased gene transcription rates.An examination of the decay of GADD45 and GADD153mRNA in TSE cells suggested that GLN caused a rapid destabilization of these two transcripts (Fig. 5). The level of these mRNAs declined rapidly after GLN repletion, regardless of actinomycin D or DRB treatment. However, these mRNAs decayed relatively slowly when cells were fed with GLN-free media containing inhibitors of transcription. The effect of GLN upon mRNA decay rate was most pronounced for GADD45. The decay of this mRNA was accelerated by 12- and 17-fold by GLN. GLN had a lesser, but still pronounced, effect on GADD153 mRNA decay, accelerating its decay by 4- and 5-fold. GLN had a lesser effect on GRP78mRNA decay, increasing its decay by less than 2-fold. Thus, the increases in GADD45, GADD153, andGRP78 mRNA levels produced by GLN deprivation can be attributed to both increases in gene transcription rates and decreases in mRNA decay rates. In the case of GADD153 andGADD45, mRNA stabilization is the predominant cause of elevated mRNA levels. This is particularly true forGADD45 mRNA, which is dramatically stabilized in GLN-deprived cells.Thus, the most striking effect of GLN deprivation observed in these cells is the pronounced inhibition of GADD45 mRNA decay. Computer analysis of the 3′-UTR of human GADD45 mRNA sequence shows that this message can assume a complex secondary configuration, which includes several stem-loop structures (data not shown). GADD45 mRNA stability may be affected by the activity of an RNA-binding protein, which interacts with one of these structures within the 3′-UTR of this mRNA. Several unstable mRNAs contain a sequence element known as an AU-rich element (ARE), which when bound by an ARE binding factor (AUF1) causes rapid degradation of these mRNAs (36DeMaria C.T. Brewer G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12179-12184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). AREs contain multiple copies of the sequence AUUUA, and two groups have determined that the consensus ARE is composed of the sequence UUAUUUAUU (37Lagnado C.A. Brown C.Y. Goodall G.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7984-7995Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar, 38Zubiaga A.M. Belasco J.G. Greenberg M.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2219-2230Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). One copy of this element is only weakly destabilizing, but two or more repeats of this element cause pronounced destabilization. It should be noted that the 3′-UTR of GADD45 mRNA is relatively AU rich (68%).GADD45 does contain two AUUUA sequences in its 3′-UTR at bases 1060 and 1278. However, neither of these match the nine-base consensus; the upstream element is UAAUUUAGA, and the downstream element is UUAUUUAUG. Thus, GADD45 contains only a single “ARE-like” element. We have not found any other known RPB recognition sequence element in the GADD45 cDNA sequence.The mechanism(s) by which GLN depletion and subsequent cellular stresses induce the transcription of and stabilize mRNAs for the growth arrest genes GADD45, GADD153, andGRP78 mRNAs remains to be determined. It is conceivable that completely separate mechanisms underlie these effects. Nonetheless, the antiproliferative nature of GADD45 andGADD153 suggests that the rapidly and dramatically up-regulated expression of these genes represents a potential molecular basis for the long observed yet poorly understood GLN dependence of mammalian cells in culture. Alternatively, the genes may serve to protect cells from the detrimental effects of GLN deprivation. GADD45 (growth arrest andDNA damage-inducible gene) is a p53-responsive gene encoding a protein that interacts with p21/WAF1/CIP1 as well as proliferating cell nuclear antigen (1Smith M.L. Chen I.T.

In fact, many treatments that lead to GRP78 expression (inhibition of protein glycosylation, glucose deprivation, and hypoxia) also induceGADD153 expression (16Wang X.Z. Lawson B. Brewer J.W.

Recently, it was shown that essential amino acid deprivation inducedGADD153 expression by both transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms (24Bruhat A. Jousse C. Wang X.Z. Ron D. Ferrara M. Fafournoux P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17588-17593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). In addition, GADD153promoter activity was induced by starvation for both essential and nonessential amino acids (24Bruhat A. Jousse C. Wang X.Z. Ron D. Ferrara M. Fafournoux P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17588-17593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). In contrast, little is known of what effects nutrient availability has on GADD45 expression. The amino acid GLN is a key regulator of cellular proliferation and survival, but there is no information regarding the mechanism by which GLN exerts this effect. In an attempt to gain insight into this phenomenon, we examined the expression of GADD45,GADD153, and GRP78 in subconfluent cultures of human breast cell lines subjected to acute GLN deprivation. The data presented here demonstrate that both GADD153 andGADD45 expression is controlled by GLN availability primarily through mRNA stabilization. Thus, GLN elicits a distinct molecular response, destabilization of GADD mRNAs. This response was particularly pronounced for GADD45 mRNA. Moreover, in a series of human breast cell lines, there is a direct correlation between the response of GADD mRNA expression to GLN deprivation and the GLN dependence of pr"

Several types of studies indicate that Cdc25s can enhance cell proliferation and oncogenesis. Furthermore, overexpression of Cdc25A and/or B have been detected in several types of primary human cancers, including breast cancers. To further assess the oncogenic capacity of Cdc25B in vivo, we have generated transgenic mice that overexpress Cdc25B in the mammary epithelium, driven by the MMTV - LTR promoter. Although these mice are grossly normal for up to 18 months, the ectopic expression of Cdc25B in their mammary glands increases the susceptibility of these mice to induction of mammary tumors by the carcinogen 9,10-dimethyl-1, 2-benzanthracene (DMBA)."

We previously showed that the rat oxytocin receptor transfected into Chinese hamster ovary cells was coupled to both Gq/11 and Gi/o, and that oxytocin stimulated ERK-2 phosphorylation and prostaglandin E2 synthesis via protein kinase C activity. In this study, we show that deletion of 51 amino acid residues from the carboxyl terminus resulted in reduced affinity for oxytocin and a corresponding rightward shift in the dose-response curve for oxytocin-stimulated [Ca2+]i. However, oxytocin-stimulated ERK-2 phosphorylation and prostaglandin E2 synthesis did not occur in cells expressing the truncated receptor. Oxytocin also failed to increase phospholipase A activity or activate protein kinase C, indicating that the mutant receptor is uncoupled from Gq-mediated pathways. The Δ51 receptor is coupled to Gi, as oxytocin-stimulated Ca2+ transients were inhibited by pertussis toxin, and a Gβγ sequestrant. Preincubation of Δ51 cells with the tyrosine kinase inhibitor, genistein, also blocked the oxytocin effect. A Δ39 mutant had all the activities of the wild type oxytocin receptor. These results show that the portion between 39 and 51 residues from the COOH terminus of the rat oxytocin receptor is required for interaction with Gq/11, but not Gi/o. Furthermore, an increase in intracellular calcium was generated via a Giβγ-tyrosine kinase pathway from intracellular stores that are distinct from Gq-mediated inositol trisphosphate-regulated stores.

Nucleic acid sequencing of cDNA clones of the oxytocin receptor (OTR) indicated that it is a member of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily (1Kimura T. Tanizawa O. Mori K. Brownstein M.J. Okayama H. Nature. 1992; 356: 526-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar). As OT plays a pivotal role in parturition and lactation, there is considerable interest in defining the structure of the OTR. It has been shown for a number of GPCRs that several regions in the cytoplasmic domains contribute directly or indirectly to G protein coupling (see Ref. 2Bourne H.R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 134-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar for a review). The juxtamembrane portions of cytoplasmic loop 3 and cytoplasmic loop 2 of several family members have been implicated in receptor-G protein interactions. In addition, the COOH-terminal region of adrenergic receptors (3O'Dowd B.F. Hnatowich M. Regan J.W. Leader W.M. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol.

At least four isoforms of the prostaglandin EP3 receptor, differing only at their COOH-terminal tails (produced by alternative splicing), couple to different G proteins to activate different second messenger systems (13Namba T.

The COOH terminus of the human parathyroid hormone receptor directs the receptor toward an interaction with Gs, whereas a core region composed of the first, second, and third intracellular loops can interact promiscuously with different G proteins (11Schneider H. Feyen J.H. Seuwen K. FEBS Lett. 1994; 351: 281-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). A truncated human AT1 receptor mutant lacking the carboxyl-terminal 50 residues is deficient in coupling to Gi, but it retains full ability to bind to Gq (12Shibata T. Suzuki C. Ohnishi J. Murakami K. Miyazaki H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 218: 383-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar).The COOH terminus of some GPCRs has also been shown to be important for desensitization, which is manifested as a diminution in responsiveness for some period of time following agonist stimulation. COOH-terminal truncation of the β2-adrenergic, α1B-adrenergic, lutropin/choriogonadotropin, platelet-activating factor, and neurokinin-2 receptors has been shown to impair homologous desensitization (15Lohse M.J.

Work on the β-adrenergic receptor, in particular, has indicated that one mechanism of desensitization involves the rapid internalization of membrane-bound receptors following agonist stimulation (15Lohse M.J.

This cysteine is known to be palmitoylated in rhodopsin (26Ovchinnikov YuA Abdulaev N.G. Bogachuk A.S. FEBS Lett. 1988; 230: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar), the β2-adrenergic receptor (27O'Dowd B.F. Hnatowich M. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Bouvier M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 7564-7569Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the α2A-adrenergic receptor (28Kennedy M.E. Limbird L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31915-31922Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to the three intracellular loops delimited by transmembrane domains, a putative fourth cytoplasmic loop is formed in many GPCRs by insertion of palmitoylcysteines into the membrane lipid bilayer (29Konig B. Arendt A. McDowell J.H. Kahlert M. Hargrave P.A. Hofmann K.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 6878-6882Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that the fourth intracellular loop is important for G protein coupling (29Konig B. Arendt A. McDowell J.H. Kahlert M. Hargrave P.A. Hofmann K.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 6878-6882Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar), and mutation of Cys-341 in the carboxyl tail of the human β2-adrenergic receptor leads to an uncoupled, nonpalmitoylated form of the receptor (27O'Dowd B.F. Hnatowich M. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Bouvier M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 7564-7569Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Studies with m2 receptors indicate that palmitoylation is not an absolute requirement for receptor interaction with G proteins, but it enhances the ability of the receptors to interact with G proteins (30Hayashi M.K. Haga T. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 340: 376-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In other cases, elimination of palmitoylation sites does not affect receptor-G protein interactions (31Jin H. Zastawny R. George S.R. O'Dowd B.F. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1997; 324: 109-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 32Eason M.G. Jacinto M.T. Theiss C.T. Liggett S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

J. 1996; 313: 611-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). However, down-regulation of the receptor number after prolonged agonist exposure was completely abolished by this mutation (32Eason M.G. Jacinto M.T. Theiss C.T. Liggett S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11178-11182Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Depalmitoylation also has been shown to increase the rate of the luteinizing hormone/human chorionic gonadotropin receptor internalization (33Kawate N. Menon K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30651-30658Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In other instances, replacement of Cys results in the specific loss of coupling to one G protein isotype but not another, namely mutation of the human endothelin receptor A resulted in no effect on the ability of endothelin to activate adenylyl cyclase, but inhibited activation of PLC (36Horstmeyer A. Cramer H. Sauer T. Muller-Esterl W. Schroeder C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20811-20819Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar).Previous work from our laboratory, using a CHO cell line that was stably transfected with the rat OTR, showed that OT stimulated rapid increases in intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i), extracellular signal-related kinase-2 (ERK-2) phosphorylation, and PGE2synthesis (37Jeng Y.-J. Lolait S.J. Strakova Z. Chen C. Copland J.A. Mellman D. Hellmich M.R. Soloff M.S. Neuropeptides. 1996; 30: 557-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 38Strakova Z. Copland J.A. Lolait S.J. Soloff M.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: E634-E641Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, the OTR was coupled to both Gq/11 and Gi in transfected CHO cells (CHO-OTR cells) (38Strakova Z. Copland J.A. Lolait S.J. Soloff M.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: E634-E641Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and in pregnant rat myometrium (39Strakova Z. Soloff M.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: E870-E876Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the present studies, we have systematically analyzed the importance of the COOH-terminal domain of the OTR on several receptor-associated processes: ligand affinity, G protein coupling via specific signal pathways, receptor desensitization, and selectivity of G-protein coupling. With the exception of a few amino acid residues, the COOH-terminal domain of the OTR is highly conserved between species (Fig. 1). This observation argues in favor of the functional importance of the COOH-terminal domain of the OTR. Previous work with the rat V1a vasopressin receptor indicated that the COOH-terminal region of the receptor is inaccessible to antibodies directed against a COOH-terminal peptide when the receptor is coupled to G proteins, but is accessible when receptor-G protein complexes are dissociated (40Strakova Z. Kumar A. Watson A.J. Soloff M.S. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 51: 217-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). As the V1avasopressin receptor is closely related to the OTR, we have examined the importance of the COOH-terminal domain of the OTR in G protein coupling by creating COOH-terminal deletion mutants. Our approach has been to create COOH-terminal truncations of 22, 39, and 51 residues. The OTR has two adjacent Cys residues at positions 351 and 352, which are potential palmitoylation sites (Fig. 2). To determine the importance of these sites in OT action in the present studies, both these residues were replaced by Ser in one of the mutant OTRs analyzed.Figure 2Truncation and replacement sites in the COOH-terminal portion of the rat OTR .

In view of the high degree of homology of the COOH-terminal domain of OTRs from several species, we reasoned that conservation would be associated with some important function(s). However, truncation of 22 and 39 residues from the COOH terminus or replacement of the Cys residues, which have been thought to be palmitoylation sites for the formation of a fourth intracellular loop, had no effect on OTR functions. These include ligand affinity, OT stimulation of increases in intracellular Ca2+, ERK-2 phosphorylation, and PGE2synthesis. The mutants were also indistinguishable from the wild type OTR with respect to homologous desensitization.Treatment of Δ51 cells with OT caused a Ca2+i transient, although higher concentrations of OT were required than with the other mutants or wild type receptor. This lower sensitivity of Δ51 cells is consistent with the lower affinity of the Δ51 receptor for OT. In contrast, no dose of OT (up to 1 μm) stimulated ERK-2 phosphorylation or PGE2 synthesis in the Δ51 cells. As we have shown previously, OT-stimulated ERK-2 phosphorylation and PGE2synthesis are mediated by PKC (38Strakova Z. Copland J.A. Lolait S.J. Soloff M.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: E634-E641Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). PKC activation occurs as a result of increased diacylglycerol synthesis, which is a product of the Gq/PLC pathway. Upon activation of cell surface receptors, PKCs translocate from the cytoplasm to membrane surfaces (48Farrar W.L. Anderson W.B. Nature. 1985; 315: 233-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). We found that OT failed to activate PKC-α translocation in the Δ51 mutant cells, but not in cells expressing the wild type OTR. The lack of PKC activation in Δ51 cells would account for the absence of OT-stimulated ERK-2 phosphorylation and PGE2 synthesis. The absence of PLC activation in the Δ51 cells accounts for the inability of OT to increase total InsP synthesis. Thus, the Ca2+mobilizing effect of OT in Δ51 cells occurred independently of OTR-mediated Gq/PLC stimulation.Our previous work, showing that wild type OTRs transfected into CHO cells are coupled to Gi as well as Gq (38Strakova Z. Copland J.A. Lolait S.J. Soloff M.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: E634-E641Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), led us to consider whether the OT-stimulated increase in [Ca2+]i in Δ51 cells is mediated by Gi instead of Gq. In Rat-1 and COS-7 cells, GPCRs coupled to pertussis toxin-sensitive G proteins mediate ERK-1/2 activation via a Gβγ subunit complex signal pathway that is dependent upon tyrosine phosphorylation and p21ras activation (49van Biesen T. Hawes B.E. Luttrell D.K. Krueger K.M. Touhara K. Porfiri E. Sakaue M. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. Nature. 1995; 376: 781-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar, 50Faure M. Voyno-Yasenetskaya T.A. Bourne H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7851-7854Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cellular expression of a specific Gβγ subunit sequestrant peptide derived from the carboxyl-terminal Gβγ subunit binding domain of the β-adrenergic receptor kinase 1, βARK1ct, was shown to inhibit LPA and α2A adrenergic receptor-mediated Shc phosphorylation in COS-7 cells (49van Biesen T. Hawes B.E. Luttrell D.K. Krueger K.M. Touhara K. Porfiri E. Sakaue M. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. Nature. 1995; 376: 781-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar). Δ51 cells were pretreated with either a Gi inhibitor (pertussis toxin), the Gβγsequestrant (βARK1ct), or a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (genistein). All three agents inhibited OT-stimulated increases in [Ca2+]i in Δ51 expressing cells; pertussis toxin and genistein also reduced the effects of OT in wild type cells. Therefore, based on our findings, it would appear that the Δ51 mutant OTR is functionally coupled to Gi, but lacks the coupling to Gq. Both Gi and Gqcoupling to the OTR occurs in cells expressing the wild type OTR. We would extrapolate from the results that truncation of the COOH-terminal tail by 22 or 39 residues, and mutating residues 351 and 352 (Cys → Ser) do not affect Gq coupling.Because OT-stimulated ERK-2 phosphorylation in CHO-OTR cells is largely mediated by Gq, we examined pertussis toxin-sensitive p38 MAP kinase phosphorylation as an indicator of a Gi-mediated process. This pathway has been shown to be activated upon stimulation of both Gq/11-coupled m1 and Gi-coupled m2 muscarinic-acetylcholine receptors (51Yamauchi J. Nagao M. Kaziro Y. Itoh H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27771-27777Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Overexpression of Gβγ or a constitutively activated mutant of Gα11, but not Gαi, also stimulated p38 kinase activity (51Yamauchi J. Nagao M. Kaziro Y. Itoh H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27771-27777Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). p38 kinase phosphorylation was stimulated by OT in Δ51-expressing cells by a process that was completely inhibited by pertussis toxin. Because PMA also stimulated p38 phosphorylation in these cells, it is apparent that both Gq and Gi mediate p38 kinase activity. Nagao et al. (52Nagao M. Yamauchi J. Kaziro Y. Itoh H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22892-22898Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) showed that Gαq/11stimulates p38 MAP kinase activity through PKC and Src family kinase-dependent pathways. These findings suggest that PMA stimulation of p38 phosphorylation in Δ51 cells occurs through PKC activation of tyrosine kinase-regulated steps. Parenthetically, the present findings are the first observations of an effect of OT on p38 phosphorylation.Pathways connecting Gi activation and intracellular Ca2+ transients in Δ51 cells are not currently known. Depletion of intracellular Ca2+ stores with thapsigargin, an inhibitor of endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase activity, resulted in the loss of the Ca2+itransient following OT stimulation of Δ51 cells. α1-Adenoreceptors utilize two different Gα subunits to increase [Ca2+]i in rat myocytes (53Macrez-Lepretre N. Kalkbrenner F. Schultz G. Mironneau J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5261-5268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Gαq appears to activate InsP production and induce the release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores, while Gα11 may enhance the Ca2+-activated Ca2+ influx that replenishes intracellular Ca2+stores (53Macrez-Lepretre N. Kalkbrenner F. Schultz G. Mironneau J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5261-5268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). This mechanism does not appear to occur with the OTR, as both the pertussin toxin-sensitive and insensitive pathways involved intracellular Ca2+ stores. If Gβγ-stimulated tyrosine kinases resulted in activation of PLC-γ, we would have expected to find a rise in inositol phosphates in the Δ51 cells after OT treatment. Gβγ activation of PLC-β isoforms to stimulate PtdInsP2 hydrolysis independent of protein tyrosine kinases (54Rhee S.G. Bae Y.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15045-15048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (809) Google Scholar) also appears to be absent in Δ51 cells. Previous work from this laboratory demonstrated that OT inhibited (Ca2+ + Mg2+) ATPase activity in sarcolemmal membranes from the rat uterine myometrium (55Soloff M.S. Sweet P. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 10687-10693Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It was postulated that inhibition of the calcium pump would hinder the extrusion of intracellular Ca2+, thus allowing OT-stimulated elevations in [Ca2+]i to be maintained. Although mechanisms coupling the OTR and (Ca2+ + Mg2+)ATPase have not been described, it is unlikely that this pathway accounts for [Ca2+]iincreases in Δ51 cells because the source of Ca2+ in Δ51 cells was thapsigargin-sensitive.Mobilization of Ca2+ from intracellular stores is mediated by three major receptors on the endoplasmic reticulum, the InsP3, ryanodine, and sphingosine-1-phosphate systems. Although we measured total InsPs to ensure that transient increases in InsP3 would not go undetected; we were unable to detect any increase after OT treatment of Δ51 cells. These results indicate that the increase in Ca2+i in Δ51 cells caused by OT is not mediated by the InsP3 receptor. We did not study the effects of ryanodine on [Ca2+]i release, as the ryanodine receptor/Ca2+ release channel, which is an essential component of excitation-contraction coupling in striated muscle cells, is not found in any significant concentration in CHO cells (56Pinnock R.D.

The two genes were cloned, and the proteins were overexpressed in Escherichia coli and purified individually and as a complex. We demonstrate that both polypeptides are needed to form the active polymerase. Similar to other polymerases constituting the B-type family, PolB possesses both polymerase and 3′–5′ exonuclease activities. We found that a homolog of replication protein A from M. thermoautotrophicuminhibits the PolB activity.

DNA-dependent DNA polymerases replicate double-stranded DNA, utilizing each complementary strand as the template for the synthesis of the other (1Kornberg A. Baker T. DNA Replication. W. H. Freeman & Co., New York1992Google Scholar). Most organisms possess several DNA polymerases that differ in their catalytic properties such as processivity, fidelity, and rate of chain extension. Different polymerases are used for replication, repair, and recombination and have distinct polypeptide compositions. They also vary between the different genomes present in organelles found in eukaryotic cells (nuclear, mitochondrial, and chloroplast). Based on their amino acid sequences, DNA polymerases (pol) 1The abbreviations used are:polpolymerasemthMethanobacterium thermoautotrophicumRPAreplication protein ARFCreplication factor CPCNAproliferating cell nuclear antigenSSBsingle-stranded DNA-binding proteinkbkilobase pairBSAbovine serum albuminPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisssDNAsingle-stranded DNAIPTGisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside can be classified into at least five distinct groups (2Braithwaite D.K.

Type (or family) A polymerases are named for their homology to Escherichia coli polI and include eubacterial, mitochondrial (polγ), and bacteriophage pols. Type B pols are named for their homology to E. coli polII. This family is more diverse than family A; they include eubacterial, bacteriophage, archaea, and viral pols and the catalytic subunits of eukaryotic polα, polδ, and polε. Eubacterial replicative pol (polIII, DnaE) is the prototype of the type C group, and the type X group includes proteins with homology to the eukaryotic β repair pols with some members also identified in eubacteria and archaea. A new group of pols, with no strong homology to any of the above families, has recently been identified in archaea (3Uemori T. Sato Y. Kato I. Doi H. Ishino Y. Genes Cells. 1997; 2: 499-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). This family is named after the first member identified, the DP2 pol fromPyrococcus furiosus.

Homologs of proteins involved in eukaryotic DNA replication have been identified within these genomes (reviewed in Refs. 9Edgell D.R. Doolittle W.F.

Microbiol. 1997; 25: 619-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar), whereas only limited similarities have been observed for bacterial proteins involved in replication. All archaea studied to date contain one or more type B pols (11Edgell D.R. Klenk H.-P. Doolitle W.F. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 2632-2640Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and perhaps also a DP2 type. However, some archaea also contain other pols, and the role of each is presently unclear (7Smith D.R. Doucette-Stamm L.A. Deloughery C. Lee H. Dubois J. Aldredge T. Bashirzadeh R. Blakely D. Cook R. Gilbert K. et al.J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 7135-7155Crossref PubMed Scopus (1038) Google Scholar). The archaeon Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum ΔH is an obligatory anaerobic thermophilic microorganism with an optimal growth temperature of 65–70 °C and a generation time of about 5 h (12Zeikus J.G. Wolfe R.S. J. Bacteriol. 1972; 109: 707-713Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Based on sequence similarities to known pols, three putative pols have been identified within its genome as follows: a type B, a type DP2, and a type X. The pol constituting the B-type is unique in being made up of two separate gene products, PolB1 and PolB2 (Fig.1 A), with calculated molecular masses of 68 and 25 kDa, respectively (their complex will be referred to hereafter as PolB). The two genes are 850 kb apart on the circular genome of M. thermoautotrophicum and are encoded on different strands (7Smith D.R. Doucette-Stamm L.A. Deloughery C. Lee H. Dubois J. Aldredge T. Bashirzadeh R. Blakely D. Cook R. Gilbert K. et al.J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 7135-7155Crossref PubMed Scopus (1038) Google Scholar). Whereas all other known B-type pols are coded as one contiguous protein, several such euryarchaeote (the major archaeal subdivision to which M. thermoautotrophicum belongs) proteins contain one to three inserts that are post-translationally removed by protein splicing (inteins) (13Perler F.B. Cell. 1998; 92: 1-4Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1 A). In this study, we describe the isolation and the biochemical characterization of the split PolB from M. thermoautotrophicum. Recombinant proteins were expressed and purified from E. coli cells, and the properties of this pol were studied in vitro. Labeled deoxy- and ribonucleoside triphosphates were obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Unlabeled deoxynucleoside triphosphates were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Single-stranded M13mp19 was from Life Technologies, Inc.; the various pET vectors used were from Novagene, and oligonucleotides were synthesized by Gene Link (Hawthorne, NY). E. coli SSB and the bacteriophage T4 gene product 32 were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Schizosaccharomyces pombe RPA was purified as described previously (14Ishiai M. Sanchez J.P. Amin A.A. Murakami Y. Hurwitz J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20868-20878Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Rabbit polyclonal antibodies were generated by Cocalico Biologicals Inc. (Reamstown, PA). The buffers used and their composition were as follows: buffer A which contained 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm EDTA, and 10% glycerol; buffer L which contained 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 500 mm NaCl, and 10% glycerol. Protein sequences were retrieved from the NCBI data bases and aligned across short conserved sequence regions using the BlockMaker (15Henikoff S. Henikoff J.G. Alford W.J. Pietrokovski S. Gene ( Amst. ). 1995; 163: 17-26Crossref Scopus (300) Google Scholar) and MACAW (16Schuler G.D. Altschul S.F. Lipman D.J. Proteins. 1991; 9: 180-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (894) Google Scholar) programs as described previously (17Pietrokovski S.

Dendrograms were calculated from the block alignments by standard methods described previously (19Pietrokovski S. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 634-635Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PolB1 and PolB2 genes (MTH1208 and MTH208, respectively) were amplified by polymerase chain reaction from M. thermoautotrophicum DNA (kindly provided by John Reeve, Ohio State University) and were cloned, after sequencing, between theNdeI and BamHI sites of the bacterial expression vector pET-16b (Novagene) (called pET16-PolB1 and pET16-PolB2). These two constructs contained a His10 tag at the N terminus of their respective proteins. PolB2 was also cloned into pET-21a (Novagene) (called pET21-PolB2) using the same restriction sites. mthRPA was cloned between the BamHI and SalI sites of pET28a (Novagene) (called pET28-RPA) and contained a His6 tag at the N terminus. A vector that expressed both subunits of PolB, PolB1 and PolB2, was generated as follows. ABglII-BamHI fragment of pET16-PolB1 that contained the entire coding region and the upstream regulatory sequences (the T7 promoter and the ribosome-binding site) was cloned into the BamHI site of pET21-PolB2. Thus, although the new vector (called pET21-PolB) expressed both subunits of PolB, only the large subunit, PolB1, contained a His10 tag. The cloning of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and the two-subunit RFC complex will be described elsewhere. PolB and mthRPA proteins were overexpressed as follows: 12 liters ofE. coli cells BL21(DE3) pLysS (Novagene) harboring the different plasmids were grown at 37 °C in Luria-Bertani (LB) medium in the presence of appropriate antibiotics. When the culture reached anA600 of 0.5, protein expression was induced by incubation in the presence of 2 mm IPTG for 3 h after which time the cells were harvested yielding 60 and 33 g (wet weight) of cells expressing PolB and mthRPA, respectively. PolB and RPA were purified from E. coli cells as follows: bacterial lysates were prepared by sonication in 75 ml of buffer L. After centrifugation for 20 min at 36,000 × g, extracts were mixed with 5 ml of Ni2+ chelate (ProBound resin, Invitrogen) for 2 h at 4 °C with gentle shaking. The mixtures were then poured onto a column, washed with 25 ml of buffer L containing 10 mm imidazole, and eluted with 10 ml of buffer L containing 500 mm imidazole. The latter fraction was dialyzed overnight against 2 liters of buffer A containing 100 mm NaCl. The dialyzed material was loaded onto a 5-ml HiTrap-Q column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with buffer A containing 100 mm NaCl. The column was washed with 25 ml of buffer A containing 200 mm NaCl and developed with a 50-ml linear gradient of NaCl from 200 to 700 mm in buffer A. The pooled protein peaks (6 mg of PolB peaking at 450 mm NaCl and 12 mg of mthRPA peaking at 550 mm NaCl) were dialyzed overnight against 2 liters of buffer A containing 100 mmNaCl (see Fig. 2 A). PolB1 was purified essentially as described for PolB but without the HiTrap-Q step from 2 liters of cells (8 g). PolB1, however, has limited solubility (see Fig. 2 B). In contrast, PolB2 was not soluble under similar conditions (see Fig.2 C) and therefore was purified in the presence of urea as follows: bacterial lysates were prepared by sonication in 75 ml of buffer L containing 6 m urea. After centrifugation for 20 min at 36,000 × g, the extract was mixed with 5 ml of Ni2+ chelate (ProBound resin, Invitrogen) for 2 h at 4 °C with gentle shaking. The mixture was then loaded onto a column, washed with 25 ml of buffer L containing 6 m urea and 10 mm imidazole, and eluted with 10 ml of buffer L containing 6 m urea plus 500 mm imidazole. The eluted protein fraction (10 mg) was dialyzed overnight against 2 liters of buffer A containing 6 m urea. Protein concentrations were determined by Bradford assay (Bio-Rad) using bovine serum albumin (BSA) as the standard. Proteins were stored at −70 °C. PolB activity was stable to repeated freezing and thawing. PolB catalyzed elongation of singly primed M13 DNA was carried out in reaction mixtures (20 μl) containing 40 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.01% BSA, 7 mmmagnesium acetate, 2 mm ATP, 100 μm each of dCTP, dGTP, and dTTP, 20 μm [α-32P]dATP (0.5–2 × 104 cpm/pmol), 12 fmol of singly primed M13 DNA (primed with M13-1 primer, map position 5999–6033), and varying levels of PolB as indicated. Reaction mixtures were incubated as indicated in the legends, stopped with 10 mm EDTA, and separated by electrophoresis through an alkaline-agarose gel (1.5%) followed by autoradiography. For quantitation, an aliquot (2 μl) of the reaction mixture was removed, and the amount of DNA synthesis was measured by adsorption to DE81 paper. Exonuclease activity was determined using two different DNA substrates. One assay involved the use of a singly primed M13 single-stranded DNA, and the other involved the use of a labeled single-stranded oligonucleotide. In the first assay, a 34-mer oligonucleotide (M13–1 map position 5999–6033) was hybridized to ssM13mp19 DNA and then labeled at its 5′-end with T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP or at its 3′-end using Klenow and [α-32P]dATP. In the second assay, a 71-mer oligonucleotide (Z18; 5′-CTTGCCCCAAAAATTGGTGCGGCGGCT GCGGCGTAGATTACGGAATGCATATCTCCTAGGAATCTCTTTGC -3′) was labeled at the 5′-end with T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP or at the 3′-end using calf thymus terminal transferase and [α-32P]dATP. Unincorporated nucleotides were removed using the QIAquick nucleotide removal kit (Qiagen). Exonuclease assays (20 μl) were performed at different temperatures in the presence of 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 50 μg/ml BSA, 20 fmol of either the 3′- or 5′-end-labeled DNA substrate, and protein concentrations as indicated in the figure legends. The removal of 32P from either the 3′- or 5′-end of the labeled substrates was analyzed using DE81 paper or by thin layer chromatography on polyethyleneimine (PEI) Cellulose F plates (EM Sciences, Gibbstown, NJ) using the solvent 0.5 m LiCl plus 1 m HCOOH, which readily separated mononucleotides from oligonucleotides. In order to examine the exonuclease activity of PolB in the presence of different SSBs, 20 fmol of either the 3′-labeled singly primed M13 DNA or the 3′-labeled oligonucleotide was incubated for 10 min with 50 fmol of PolB using the standard exonuclease assay. In reactions containing singly primed M13 DNA, no SSB or 15 pmol of E. coli SSB or mthRPA was added. In reactions containing the 71-mer oligonucleotide, no SSB or 200 fmol of E. coli SSB or mthRPA was added. To demonstrate that the activity observed with preparations of PolB was not due to contamination with E. coli pols, a portion of the HiTrap-Q purified protein fractions (140 μg in 200 μl buffer A) was applied to a 5-ml 15–35% glycerol gradient in buffer A containing 500 mm NaCl. After centrifugation at 45,000 rpm (190,000 × g) for 19 h in an SW50.1 rotor at 4 °C, fractions (200 μl) were collected from the bottom of the tube. The distribution of PolB was detected following 10% SDS-PAGE and staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue (R-250) and by the assay of each fraction for PolB activity (using 1 μl of each fraction diluted 50-fold in buffer A) using the standard replication conditions at (70 °C) as described above. The interaction between mthRPA and PolB was examined by incubating 140 μg of each protein (in 200 μl) alone or together for 10 min at 70 °C and then subjecting the mixtures to a glycerol gradient centrifugation step as described above. After centrifugation, fractions were analyzed by 10% SDS-PAGE followed by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue (R-250). As originally reported, mthPolB is encoded by two separate genes that are 850 kb apart and located on different strands (7Smith D.R. Doucette-Stamm L.A. Deloughery C. Lee H. Dubois J. Aldredge T. Bashirzadeh R. Blakely D. Cook R. Gilbert K. et al.J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 7135-7155Crossref PubMed Scopus (1038) Google Scholar). The sequences of these two proteins together correspond jointly to the single contiguous protein characteristic of all other known type B pols and contain all their conserved motifs. The division of these two genes occurs in a non-conserved sequence region, unlike the intein integration sites of related pols that are all found in highly conserved regions (Fig.1 A). Within the archaea, the type B DNA pol can be divided into three subgroups of which the mthPolB falls within the archaeal group I of the type B DNA pols (11Edgell D.R. Klenk H.-P. Doolitle W.F. J.

To determine whether PolB is an active pol, its subunits (PolB1 and PolB2) were purified and characterized individually and as the complex. The genes encoding PolB1 and PolB2 (open reading frames MTH1208 andMTH208, respectively (7Smith D.R. Doucette-Stamm L.A. Deloughery C. Lee H. Dubois J. Aldredge T. Bashirzadeh R. Blakely D. Cook R. Gilbert K. et al.J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 7135-7155Crossref PubMed Scopus (1038) Google Scholar)) were inserted individually and together into E. coli expression vectors and expressed as fusion proteins containing N-terminal His6 tags (see “Experimental Procedures”). The PolB complex, containing both subunits, was soluble and was purified to near homogeneity by affinity chromatography onto Ni2+ chelate and a HiTrap-Q column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) (Fig.2 A). PolB1 alone was marginally soluble (few percent) and was purified by affinity chromatography on Ni2+ chelate (Fig. 2 B), whereas PolB2 was completely insoluble and could be extracted from cells only in the presence of 6 m urea. PolB2 was purified to near homogeneity following chromatography on Ni2+chelate in the presence of 6 m urea (Fig. 2 C). This protein fraction was used to generate polyclonal antibodies against PolB2. The observations that the two individual subunits were not soluble when each was expressed alone but were soluble as the heterodimeric complex support the idea that they work jointly together. Glycerol gradient centrifugation of the pooled HiTrap-Q fractions of PolB yielded a single peak of DNA synthetic activity that sedimented between aldolase and BSA (Fig. 3). SDS-PAGE analysis of the gradient fractions revealed that the peak of pol activity sedimented coincidentally with both PolB proteins (Fig.3). M. thermoautotrophicum is a thermophile that grows optimally at 65–70 °C (12Zeikus J.G. Wolfe R.S. J. Bacteriol. 1972; 109: 707-713Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For this reason, we examined the influence of temperature on DNA synthesis catalyzed by PolB. As shown in Fig.4 A, PolB, at the concentration used (50 fmol), was not appreciably active at temperatures below 50 and above 80 °C, observations consistent with the optimal growth conditions. Furthermore, under appropriate conditions, the addition of 228 fmol of PolB was sufficient to replicate the entire 7.25 kb of M13 between 10 and 20 min at 60 °C (Fig. 4 B). In similar experiments, no replication activity was detected when the PolB1 subunit alone was used (data not shown). Pols from several archaea have been studied, and each has distinct salt, pH, and Mg2+ requirements for optimal activity. These parameters were determined for PolB. Optimal activity was observed in the presence of 100 mm NaCl (Fig. 4 C), 7 mm Mg2+, and at pH 7.5 (data not presented). The effects of several pol inhibitors were also examined.N-Ethylmaleimide and aphidicolin, which inhibit eukaryotic polα, polε, and polδ (1Kornberg A. Baker T. DNA Replication. W. H. Freeman & Co., New York1992Google Scholar), and N(2)-(Butylphenyl)dGTP (kindly provided by George Wright, University of Massachusetts), which specifically inhibits polα, did not affect the activity of PolB. Antibodies generated against PolB2 inhibited PolB polymerase activity, further supporting the conclusion that the two subunits jointly participate in supporting DNA synthesis. These antibodies, however, did not inhibit the activity of E. coli polI (data not presented). The majority of enzymes in the B family of pols possess exonuclease activity. Several members, however, do not (e.g. polα). The amino acid sequence of PolB includes a putative exonuclease domain located between amino acids residues 165 and 362 of the PolB1 subunit (Fig. 1 A). The following experiments were designed to determine whether PolB possessed exonuclease activity. As shown in Fig. 5 A, PolB preparations contain a temperature-dependent 3′ to 5′ exonuclease activity when assayed in the presence of a singly primed M13 DNA template. Although no activity was observed at 30 °C, efficient removal of the 32P-labeled nucleotide from the 3′-end of the primed DNA was observed at 70 °C (Fig. 5 A). At 50 °C, the efficiency of exonuclease activity was lower than that observed at 70 °C but greater than that detected at 30 °C. These results are similar to the temperature effects observed for DNA synthesis (see Fig. 4 A). No 5′ to 3′ exonuclease activity was detected when the enzyme was incubated with either the primed DNA at any temperature (30–70 °C; data not presented) or single-stranded polydeoxyoligonucleotide substrates (data not shown). When reactions were incubated for a longer length of time or when high levels of PolB were used, the length of the 5′-labeled oligonucleotide was reduced due to its digestion from the 3′-end as judged by its chromatographic properties on PEI plates (data not shown). Under the conditions used in the experiment described in Fig. 5 (50 fmol of PolB), 3′–5′ exonuclease activity was not observed at 30 °C. However, when the concentration of PolB was increased 300-fold, 3′ to 5′ exonuclease activity was detected (data not shown). Although PolB exhibited limited exonuclease activity at low temperatures on primed ssDNA, potent 3′ to 5′ exonuclease activity was evident even at low temperatures in the presence of the single-stranded polydeoxyoligonucleotide substrate (Fig. 5 B). Since the exonuclease domain of the pol is located in the PolB1 subunit, we examined whether PolB1 by itself possesses exonuclease activity. As shown in Fig. 5 B, PolB1 exhibited exonuclease activity, but its activity was lower than that observed with the PolB complex (2-fold at 50 °C). Whether this is due to the limited solubility of PolB1 (and possible aggregation) or to the activation of the exonuclease activity of PolB1 through its association with PolB2 is presently unknown. In mesophiles, a single-stranded DNA-binding protein (SSB) is an essential component of all replication systems (1Kornberg A. Baker T. DNA Replication. W. H. Freeman & Co., New York1992Google Scholar). SSBs stimulate the activity of pols by removing DNA secondary structures that interfere with their movement. M. thermoautotrophicumgrows at high temperatures, and thus the problems due to DNA secondary structure are likely to be reduced. However, a sequence search revealed the presence of RPA homologs in the M. thermoautotrophicumgenome (mthRPA). When the sequence of the M. thermoautotrophicum genome was first published, it was reported that RPA is encoded by two genes with partially overlapping sequences (7Smith D.R. Doucette-Stamm L.A. Deloughery C. Lee H. Dubois J. Aldredge T. Bashirzadeh R. Blakely D. Cook R. Gilbert K. et al.J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 7135-7155Crossref PubMed Scopus (1038) Google Scholar). The authors suggested that there might be a frameshift mutation in the sequence. The cloning and sequencing of the two putative mthRPA genes described in this study detected a single base insertion in the published sequence located in the overlap region. Correction of this error indicated that the nucleotide sequence of the gene encoding mthRPA is one continuous sequence leading to a single polypeptide chain of 792 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 90.2 kDa (Fig.6 A). In keeping with the sequence presented in Fig. 6 A, the cloning, expression, and isolation of mthRPA (as described under “Experimental Procedures”) yielded a single protein band of the expected size (Fig. 6 B) that contained strong ssDNA binding activity. The experiments described in Fig. 4 were carried out in the absence of a SSB. In the following experiments the role of SSB on PolB replication activity was examined (Fig. 7). Surprisingly, DNA synthesis by PolB was inhibited by mthRPA. Reactions carried out at 60–70 °C in the presence of mthRPA were inhibited (Fig. 7, A and B); reactions carried out with SSBs from other organisms did not inhibit DNA synthesis by PolB and even slightly stimulated DNA synthesis compared with reactions carried out without SSB (Fig. 7 A). Although S. pombe RPA and phage T4 gene product 32 bind weakly to DNA at 70 °C, E. coli SSB strongly binds DNA at 30 and 70 °C (data not presented). The inhibition of PolB-catalyzed DNA synthesis by mthRPA appears specific. mthRPA did not inhibit Thermus aquaticus(Taq) (Life Technologies, Inc.) and P. furiosus(Pfu) (Stratagene) DNA polymerases under similar assay conditions (data not presented). To determine whether the inhibition of DNA synthesis was dependent on the concentration of RPA, the effects of increased levels of mthRPA were examined. As shown in Fig. 7, B and C, mthRPA inhibited DNA synthesis in a concentration-dependent manner. These results also demonstrated that the inhibition was predominantly due to the ssDNA binding activity of mthRPA and not to its interaction with the polymerase (described below). At the lowest levels of mthRPA added, mthRPA was present to a large molar excess over PolB (Fig. 7, B and C). At the highest concentration added, enough RPA was present to coat the entire DNA template. This value was calculated assuming that mthRPA and the RPA from Methanococcus jannaschii bind to DNA in an identical manner. RPA from this archaea was shown to bind 15–20 nucleotides of ssDNA per molecule of RPA (20Kelly T.J. Simancek P. Brush G.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14634-14639Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). We next examined the effect of SSB on the 3′ to 5′ exonuclease activity of PolB. Both primed ssDNA and single-stranded polydeoxyoligonucleotide were used as substrates to determine whether mthRPA affected the 3′ to 5′ exonuclease activity. As shown in Fig.8 A, exonuclease activity with singly primed M13 DNA was not detected at 30 °C in the absence of SSB. This low activity was stimulated by the addition of SSBs (Fig.8 A). This may be due to a reduction in the nonspecific binding of the pol to the extensive ssDNA region. At higher temperatures (50 and 70 °C), exonuclease activity was detected without SSBs and their presence stimulated the exonuclease activity (Fig. 8 A). When the single-stranded polydeoxyoligonucleotide substrate (71-mer) was used, the 3′ to 5′ exonuclease activity of PolB was detected at all temperatures (Fig. 8 B). The exonuclease activity was slightly reduced by the presence of SSB at all temperatures. These results demonstrate that in contrast to the polymerase activity of PolB, its 3′ to 5′ exonuclease activity was hardly affected by mthRPA. In several replication systems, pols have been shown to interact directly with their corresponding SSBs. For example, eukaryotic polα interacts with RPA (21Dornreiter I. Erdile L.F.

In normal man and most mammalian species, body weight is maintained within narrow limits through regulation of both caloric intake and energy expenditure (1Tataranni P.A.

If caloric intake persistently exceeds energy expenditure, obesity is an inevitable consequence. However, there are obvious differences in the tendency to obesity among individuals with seemingly equivalent caloric intake and similar degrees of physical activity (3Ravussin E. Lillioja S.

Genet. 1996; 13: 18-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (753) Google Scholar), leading in several instances to elucidation of the mechanisms underlying phenotypic expression. Studies in these animal models and in obese humans have led to the concepts of energy efficiency and of nutrient partitioning as being important physiological mechanisms underlying individual or strain differences in the propensity to become obese (1Tataranni P.A. Diabetes Metab. 1998; 24: 108-115PubMed Google Scholar, 14Astrup A. Raben A. Buemann B. Toubro S. Ann. N. Y. Acad.

Individuals with high energy efficiency require fewer calories to meet basal metabolic needs and accomplish a given level of physical work. Thus, on a given caloric intake, more calories are, in essence, left over, and are stored as fat. Individuals with low energy efficiency utilize more of their caloric intake for basal metabolism and physical work, leaving fewer calories for storage as fat. The factors responsible for differences in energy efficiency are incompletely understood. The concept of nutrient partitioning suggests that the body may preferentially shunt particular energy substrates either toward consumption as fuel or into storage as fat. Conceptually, nutrient partitioning might be one determinant of energy efficiency. The homozygous obese Zucker fatty rat (fa/fa) is a well studied animal model in which obesity is a consequence of a mutation in the leptin receptor (11Chua Jr, S.C. Chung W.K. Wu-Peng S. Zhang Y.

These changes have the effect of partitioning LCFFA away from tissues in which they would be burned as fuel into adipocytes, where they are stored as triglyceride. Adipocyte LCFFA uptake was already up-regulated in 19–21-dayfa/fa weanlings prior to the development of obvious obesity (17Berk P.D. Zhou S.-L. Kiang C.-L. Stump D. Bradbury M. Isola L.M. J. Biol.

To determine whether the observed tissue-specific changes in LCFFA uptake are specific to the Zucker model or are a more general feature of obesity, studies of LCFFA uptake kinetics were conducted in homozygous adult male mice of four different strains bearing obesity-causing mutations and in adult male Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats fed a high fat diet in which 55% of calories were derived from lard. Appreciable tissue-specific up-regulation of LCFFA uptake was observed in adipocytes from all of these animal models of obesity. These results suggest that, in established obesity resulting from a variety of different underlying pathogenetic mechanisms, tissue-specific changes in cellular uptake mechanisms effectively partition LCFFA into storage within adipocytes, thereby perpetuating the obese phenotype. long chain free fatty acids lipoprotein lipase bovine serum albumin mitochondrial aspartate aminotransferase plasma membrane fatty acid-binding protein fatty acid translocase fatty acid transporting protein unbound oleate concentration oleate:BSA molar ratio long chain free fatty acids lipoprotein lipase bovine serum albumin mitochondrial aspartate aminotransferase plasma membrane fatty acid-binding protein fatty acid translocase fatty acid transporting protein unbound oleate concentration oleate:BSA molar ratio Homozygous male obese (ob), diabetic (db), fat (fat), and tubby (tub) mice were obtained at 5–10 weeks of age, as available, from The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME), along with age-matched male C57BL/6J and C57BLKS control mice.

Oleate uptake by these cell types is linear within this time period. The slopes of the cumulative uptakeversus time curves, representing initial uptake velocity, were calculated from this linear portion of the curve by a least mean squares fit. At the 500 μm BSA concentration employed, the observed kinetics again reflect membrane transport (30Sorrentino D. Robinson R.B. Kiang C.-L. Berk P.D. J. Clin.

Kiang C.-L. Stump D. Bradbury M. Isola L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8830-8835Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), we subsequently conducted studies in adipocytes from the former site. This reduced the numbers of animals necessary for each study. Each oleate uptake study in hepatocytes and in adipocytes from the ob,db, fat, and tub mutants was performed with cells isolated from a single animal. To obtain sufficient cells, studies in control adipocytes still required pooled cells harvested from 2–4 mice. The unbound oleate concentration (Ou) was calculated from the oleate:BSA molar ratio (ν) (35Wosilait W.D. Nagy P. Comput. Programs Biomed. 1976; 6: 142-148Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) using the FFA:BSA binding constants of Spector et al.(36Spector A.A. Fletcher J.E. Ashbrook J.D. Biochemistry. 1971; 10: 3229-3232Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Although recent reports (37Richieri G.V. Kleinfeld A.M. J. Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 229-240Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 38Rose H. Conventz M. Fischer Y. Jüngling E. Hennecke T. Kammermeier H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1215: 321-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) suggest that these constants overestimate Ou, there is no general agreement on alternative values. Use of the more recent data would modify the computed values ofKm and k but would not change the conceptual interpretation of these studies. Therefore, we continue to use the binding constant values of Spector (36Spector A.A. Fletcher J.E. Ashbrook J.D. Biochemistry. 1971; 10: 3229-3232Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar), to permit comparison of these studies with the large body of related earlier work. Based on prior analyses (39Stump D.D. Nunes R.M. Sorrentino D. Berk P.D. J. Hepatol. 1992; 16: 304-315Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) for each group of animals and cell type studied, measurements of initial oleate uptake velocity obtained at values of ν from 0.1–2.0 were fitted to the sum of a saturable and a nonsaturable function of the corresponding Ou, using the Simulation, Analysis and Modeling (SAAM) program of Berman and Weiss (40Berman M. Weiss M.F. Users' Manual for SAAM. U. S. Public Health Service Publication 1703, Department of Health and Human Services, U. S. Government Printing Office, Washington, D. C.1967Google Scholar). SAAM computes, for each data set, the values of theVmax (pmol/s/50,000 cells) andKm (nm) of the saturable uptake function and the rate constant k (ml/s/50,000 cells) for the nonsaturable uptake process, as well as their variances and co-variances. For comparing parameter values obtained for different experimental groups, the computed statistical parameters are equivalent to the standard error of the slope of a linear regression (40Berman M. Weiss M.F. Users' Manual for SAAM. U. S. Public Health Service Publication 1703, Department of Health and Human Services, U. S. Government Printing Office, Washington, D. C.1967Google Scholar). Accordingly, computed values for physiologic variables are also expressed as mean ± S.E. Differences between groups were evaluated with two-tailed Student's t tests. Cellular RNA was isolated with a guanidinium thiocyanate phenol-chloroform single-step extraction method (41Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (63088) Google Scholar) using a Stragagene (La Jolla, CA) kit. To isolate adipocyte RNA, cells were first disrupted and chilled to 4 °C. Aqueous cellular contents were then aspirated with a micropipette inserted through the layer of congealed lipid that rises to the top of the tube. 2We are indebted to Dr. Susan Fried for suggesting this procedure. RNA extraction then continued as described. RNA samples were separated in 1.2% agarose-formaldehyde gels and transferred to Hybond-N nylon membranes (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in 20× SSC. The membranes were prehybridized for 3 h and then hybridized overnight to32P-labeled DNA probes of interest (42Thomas P.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 5201-5205Crossref PubMed Scopus (5857) Google Scholar). Relative quantities of message in various samples were determined by autoradiography. Band intensity was quantitated by scanning densitometry using a pdi (Huntington Station, NY) Discovery Scanner, attached to a Sun SPARC work station. Quantity 1 (pdi) software was used to compute the area under the curve (OD × mm2) for each band of interest. Results were normalized for lane loading by comparison with the signal intensity obtained with rodent β-actin. The variability of replicate scans of the same film was less than ±5%. In a series of duplicate studies with adipocyte RNA samples from paired control mice, the coefficient of variation for the ratio of bands of interest to actin was ±25%. Accordingly, message levels in mutant mice were considered significantly increased if densitometric measurements of the appropriate autoradiographic bands were >1.5-fold those in controls, after normalization for the corresponding actin signal. [3H]Oleate uptake by adipocytes from ob and db animals was studied in mice 12–13 weeks of age, at which time they weighed 2.0 and 1.8 times as much as their respective age-matched C57BL/6J and C57BLKS controls (TableI). The tub and fatanimals became obese more slowly, weighing 1.7 and 1.3 times that of their corresponding control animals when studied at 35 and 27 weeks of age, respectively. Although adipocyte leptin message levels were markedly increased in all four mutant strains when compared with their C57BL/6J and C57BLKS controls (see below), serum leptin levels were undetectable in the ob animals when assayed with the antibody supplied by Linco. As reported (43Maffei M. Halaas J. Ravussin E. Pratley R.E. Lee G.H. Zhang Y. Fei H. Lallone R. Ranganathan S. Kern P.M. Friedman J.A. Nat. Med. 1995; 1: 1155-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (3301) Google Scholar), serum leptin levels were significantly increased in db, fat, andtub animals (Table I). Adipocytes isolated from each of the obese strains were appreciably larger than those of the control animals (Fig. 1). Calculated cell surface areas in the mutant strains were 2.9 to 4.2 (mean ± S.E., 3.7 ± 0.4) times those of the controls.Table I[3H]Oleate uptake studies in adipocytes from mice with various obesity mutationsStrain (n)an = number of studies.AgeWeightAdipocyte [3H]oleate uptakeAdipocyte sizeb1 arbitrary unit = 9.6 microns.Serum leptinVmaxKmkDiameterSurface areaweeksgpmol/s/50,000 cellsnmml/s/50,000 cellsarbitrary unitsarbitrary units2ng/mlob(4)12.9 ± 1.351.9 ± 3.833.9 ± 5.8cp < 0.001 compared with control strain.193 ± 47dp < 0.005 compared with control strain.0.0119 ± 0.004013.3591UndetectableC57BL/6J (3)12.9 ± 0.0225.5 ± 0.36.2 ± 1.328 ± 100.0066 ± 0.00356.61414.2 ± 0.8eNo differences in serum leptin concentrations were observed between younger and older mice of either control strain.

Representative LCFFA uptake curves from each of the mutant strains and from those in corresponding, age-matched controls are shown in Fig. 2.Vmax values in all four mutant strains were significantly increased, ranging from 4.5 to 12.5 times those in the corresponding controls (Table I). The relative increase inVmax averaged 6.8-fold, which is nearly double the increase in surface area of the corresponding adipocyte populations. The rate constant for nonsaturable uptake (k) was also increased by an average of 2.9 ± 0.4-fold in all of the mutant strains. This increase, which was statistically significant (p < 0.001) only in the db andfat animals, was similar to the increase in adipocyte surface area (p > 0.1), as would be anticipated for a passive, diffusive process. Representative Northern hybridizations of probes for leptin, FABPpm, FAT, and FATP with adipocyte RNA from individual mice are illustrated in Fig.3. The observed ratios of these message levels and that of LPL in mutant animals compared with those in controls are presented in Fig. 4. Expression of leptin mRNA was consistently up-regulated by a mean of 7.3–13.7-fold in adipocytes from each of the four mutant strains. Somewhat smaller and more variable increases (means, 5.1-fold each inob, db, and fat and 1.9-fold intub) were also observed in lipoprotein lipase message levels. Although the magnitude of the changes showed considerable inter-animal variability (Fig. 4), adipocyte FABPpmmRNA was increased in all ob (mean, 9-fold) anddb (mean, 11-fold) mice, as it is in the Zucker rat (17Berk P.D.

All of these mutants lack a competent leptin/leptin receptor system. By contrast, FABPpm mRNA was not increased in any of thefat or tub animals, i.e. in strains with normal leptin signaling capability. Adipocyte FAT mRNA was increased to lesser degrees in fat (mean, 6.5-fold),ob (mean, 4.2-fold), and tub (mean, 2.2-fold) mice, but not in db"

Here, we define the domain arrangement and polypeptide composition of the Kip1p holoenzyme. Electron microscopy of rotary shadowed Kip1p molecules revealed two globular domains 14 nm in diameter connected by a 73-nm long stalk. When the Kip1p domain homologous to the kinesin motor domain was decorated with an unrelated protein, the diameter of the globular domains at both ends of the stalk increased, indicating that Kip1p is bipolar. Soluble Kip1p isolated from S. cerevisiae cells was homomeric, based on the similarity of the sedimentation coefficients of native Kip1p from S. cerevisiae and Kip1p which was purified after expression in insect cells. The holoenzyme molecular weight was estimated using the sedimentation coefficient and Stokes radius, and was most consistent with a tetrameric composition. Kip1p exhibited an ionic strength-dependent transition in its sedimentation coefficient, revealing a potential regulatory mechanism. The position of kinesin motor-related domains at each end of the stalk may allow Kip1p to cross-link either parallel or antiparallel microtubules during mitotic spindle assembly and pole separation.

The position of kinesin motor-related domains at each end of the stalk may allow Kip1p to cross-link either parallel or antiparallel microtubules during mitotic spindle assembly and pole separation. Assembly of the mitotic spindle and separation of the spindle poles during anaphase depends on the function of several distinct members of the kinesin family of force-generating proteins. A major class of kinesins in higher and lower eukaryotes which associate with the spindle are members of the bimC subfamily. The bimC kinesins, like all kinesin subfamilies, have been grouped by sequence conservation within the kinesin-related motor domain (1Moore J.D. Endow S.A. Bioessays. 1996; 18: 207-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Conditional mutants have been used to show that the bimC kinesins Kip1p and Cin8p ofSaccharomyces cerevisiae, bimC of Aspergillus nidulans, cut7 of Schizosaccharomyces pombe, and KLP61F (KRP130) of Drosophila melanogaster are required for separation of the duplicated spindle poles during mitotic spindle assembly (2Hoyt M.A. He L.

Antibody-mediated depletion or inactivation of bimC kinesin Eg5 of Xenopus and human reveal spindle pole separation defects as well as defects in spindle pole organization, suggesting some bimC kinesins also organize parallel microtubules into bundles (7Gaglio T.

Biol. 1998; 8: 903-913Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). In addition, the bimC kinesins may have functions subsequent to spindle assembly. Kip1p and Cin8p are required for maintenance of pole separation during metaphase and have been implicated in anaphase B spindle elongation, and KLP61F has been localized by immunoelectron microscopy to the midzone of anaphase spindles (11Straight A.F. Sedat J.W. Murray A.W. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 687-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 12Saunders W.S.

Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 125-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). The simplest model that explains bimC function in pole separation is that the motor proteins cross-link microtubules emanating from opposite poles and slide them apart. Although the conserved motor domain defines membership in the kinesin family, intracellular function is largely specified by sequences outside the motor domain which determine the oligomeric composition and the cargo. The best characterized holoenzyme structure is of “conventional” kinesin. Conventional kinesin from a number of tissue sources is found primarily as a heterotetramer composed of two identical heavy chains and two light chains (15Kuznetsov S.A. Vaisberg E.A. Shanina N.A. Magretova N.N. Chernyak V.K. Gelfand V.I. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 353-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 16Bloom G.S. Wagner M.C. Phister K.K. Brady S.T.

Cytoskeleton. 1989; 12: 264-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The heavy chains form a closely associated pair of NH2-terminal globular motor domains followed by an extended stalk consisting of a parallel two-stranded α-helical coiled coil. The stalk links the motor domains to the vesicle cargo by interactions with the COOH-terminal globular domain of the heavy chains, and possibly with the light chains which appear to associate with the COOH-terminal end of the stalk by a coiled-coil interaction (18Gauger A.K. Goldstein L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13657-13666Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Diefenbach R.J. Mackay J.P. Armati P.J. Cunningham A.L. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 16663-16670Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). There is a wide diversity of holoenzyme compositions and domain arrangements among other members of the kinesin family. Kinesins have been characterized that contain a single motor subunit, four identical motor subunits or two distinct motor subunits, and a variety of non-motor accessory chains have been identified (reviewed in Ref. 20Vale R.D. Fletterick R.J. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 745-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). Knowledge of the oligomeric composition and domain arrangement of a kinesin holoenzyme can provide significant insight into its intracellular function and mechanism. The bimC kinesin KLP61F fromDrosophila embryos is a homotetramer with a pair of motor domains at each end of a stalk (21Cole D.G. Saxton W.M. Sheehan K.B. Scholey J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22913-22916Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Kashina A.S. Baskin R.J. Cole D.G. Wedaman K.P. Saxton W.M. Scholey J.M. Nature. 1996; 379: 270-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). This bipolar configuration apparently allows KLP61F to cross-link adjacent microtubules in interpolar regions of the mitotic spindle where microtubule orientation is parallel and in the spindle midzone where many microtubules are antiparallel (14Sharp D.J. McDonald K.L. Brown H.M. Matthies H.J. Walczak C. Vale R.D. Mitchison T.J. Scholey J.M. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 125-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). An outstanding question is whether all bimC kinesins will share this domain arrangement, particularly since the non-motor sequences which specify quaternary structure show little sequence conservation. The only sequence conserved in the non-motor region is the bimC box, a 40-amino acid region located near the COOH terminus with 25–50% sequence identity (6Heck M.M.S. Pereira A. Pesavento P. Yannoni Y. Spradling A.C. Goldstein L.S.B. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 665-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). However, bimC box function does not appear to be conserved. Phosphorylation of an invariant threonine in the bimC box of Eg5 and KLP61F targets the protein to the mitotic spindle, but mutation of the invariant threonine has no effect on cut7 spindle targeting or function, and the bimC box is absent in Kip1p and Cin8p (8Blangy A.

To investigate how Kip1p of S. cerevisiae functions in mitotic spindle assembly, we characterized the oligomeric composition and the positions of the kinesin-related domains in the Kip1p holoenzyme. Using size exclusion chromatography and sucrose gradient centrifugation, we found that soluble Kip1p is most likely homomeric and consists of four Kip1p polypeptides. Electron microscopy of rotary shadowed Kip1p molecules demonstrated that native Kip1p has globular domains located at both ends of a long stalk. Decoration of the kinesin-related domains with an unrelated protein increased the size of the globular domains at both ends of the stalk, demonstrating that Kip1p is bipolar. Thus Kip1p shares structural features with the bimC kinesin KLP61F. While the bimC kinesins were previously grouped by sequence conservation in the motor domains and by similar roles in spindle assembly, our results here suggest that bimC kinesins also share a common oligomeric composition and domain arrangement. A Kip1p molecule with kinesin motor-related domains at opposite ends of a stalk could bundle and organize microtubules in the mitotic spindle which are parallel, as well as bundle antiparallel microtubules extending from opposite poles and slide them apart. The yeast strains used in this study are derivatives of S. cerevisiae S288C. Strains used were DS138 (Mataura3-52, leu2-3, 112, trp1Δ1, his3Δ200) for expression of native Kip1p and DS104 (Mataura3-52, leu2-3, 112,ade2-101, his3Δ200 kip1Δ1::HIS3pMR2310) for expression of HA 1The abbreviations used are:HAhemagglutininHis6a tag of six consecutive histidine residuesNi-NTA agaroseNi2+-nitriloacetic acid agaroseGSTglutathioneS-transferase -Kip1p.

Meluh P.B. Rose M.D. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 95-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). To construct the baculovirus transfer vector for expression of His6-Kip1p in insect cells, a unique BamHI site was introduced at the NH2 terminus of KIP1 by polymerase chain reaction amplification, and a 4.5-kilobaseBamHI-NotI fragment containing theKIP1 gene was cloned into theBamHI-NotI sites of pVL1393 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). A 22-base pair double-stranded oligonucleotide encoding a Met-His6 tag was introduced at the BamHI site, creating plasmid pDR688. The correct sequence of the tag and the polymerase chain reaction-amplified region of KIP1 was verified by DNA sequencing. The resulting KIP1 gene encodes the following amino acid sequence at the NH2 terminus: MHHHHHHGSIMARS. . . . . (the native KIP1starting methionine is shown in bold). To test whether His6-Kip1p functions in yeast, the tagged gene was subcloned into a centromere-based plasmid containing theADH1 gene promoter, and complementation of a kip1Δ cin8Δ mutant was tested using the plasmid shuffle technique, as described for HA-Kip1p by Roof et al. (3Roof D.M. Meluh P.B. Rose M.D. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 95-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Kip1p polyclonal antibodies were generated in rabbits using bacterially expressed and glutathione-agarose purified GST-Kip1 (residues 493–758) and GST-Kip1 (residues 757–1111) fusion proteins. Antigen columns were made from the above purified proteins by coupling to CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B beads according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Piscataway, NJ). Kip1p-specific antibodies were isolated from total rabbit antisera using the Kip1p antigen columns followed by protein A concentration (26Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar). Native Kip1p was detected by immunoblotting using an enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (Amersham Corp., Arlington Heights, IL) with a mixture of the two affinity purified Kip1p polyclonal antibodies followed by anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody. HA-tagged Kip1p was detected by immunoblotting using the enhanced chemiluminescence detection system with the 12CA5 monoclonal antibody followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibody. The incubation buffer was 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, 0.2% Tween 20 supplemented with 2% bovine serum albumin for the blocking and primary antibody incubation steps or supplemented with 5% milk for all secondary antibody incubations. Antibody incubations were 1 h at room temperature. Yeast cell lysates containing Kip1p were prepared by vortexing cells for 3 min with one-half volume of glass beads in Hepes 350 buffer (350 mmNaCl, 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 1 mmMgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 2% glycerol, and protease inhibitors (1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm benzamidine HCl, and 10 μg/ml each of leupeptin, chymostatin, and pepstatin A)). The resulting extract was centrifuged at 170,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C in a Beckman TLA 120.2 rotor and the high speed soluble material was used for sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation or size exclusion chromatography. His6-Kip1p was expressed from the polyhedrin promoter in Trichoplusia ni (Hi Five) cells (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) in Express Five media (Life Technologies, Inc.) using standard techniques (27O'Reilly D.R. Miller L.K. Luckow V.A. Baculovirus Expression Vectors: A Laboratory Manual. W. H. Freeman, New York1992Google Scholar) by the Recombinant Protein Production core facility, Wistar Institute, Philadelphia, PA. Cells were collected 50 h post-infection by centrifugation and the cell pellets were stored at −80 °C. Nuclei were isolated as described previously (28Murray M. Turnage M. Williamson K. Steinhauer W. Searles L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2291-2300Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) by briefly vortexing cells in lysis buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 150 mm NaCl, 1% glycerol, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mm benzamidine HCl) followed by centrifugation at 700 × g for 5 min. The resulting nuclei were lysed by vortexing with glass beads in lysis buffer supplemented with 1% Triton X-100, 50 μm MgATP, and 0.5 m NaCl, and the supernatant was spun at 170,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C in a Beckman TLA 120.2 rotor. The soluble nuclear fraction was loaded onto a Sephacryl S-400 column (1 × 49 cm) and 1-ml fractions were collected. The peak Kip1p containing fractions were pooled and passed over a Ni-NTA-agarose column (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). The column was washed with 10–15 column volumes of 20 mm imidazole, pH 7.0, buffer, and bound Kip1p was eluted with 400 mmimidazole, pH 7.0, buffer containing 300 mm NaCl, 0.2% Triton X-100, 1 mm MgCl2, and 50 μm MgATP. Kip1p was over 90% pure as judged by colloidal Coomassie Blue staining (Sigma) and densitometric analysis; the two co-purifying proteins were degradation products of Kip1p as shown by immunoblotting using Kip1p-specific antibodies. For decoration of Kip1p for electron microscopy, His6-Kip1p was purified by isolation of the nuclear fraction followed by Ni-NTA-agarose chromatography as described above. After Ni-NTA chromatography, the Kip1p was diluted 20-fold to lower the imidazole concentration to 20 mm and incubated with a 3-fold molar excess of Ni-NTA alkaline phosphatase conjugate (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) for 1 h at 4 °C. His6-Kip1p·Ni-NTA alkaline phosphatase complexes were then separated from unbound His6-Kip1p by centrifugation at 250,000 ×g for 2 h 15 min at 4 °C in a Beckman TLS55 rotor through a 2-ml 10–30% linear sucrose gradient. Fractions containing Ni-NTA alkaline phosphatase-bound His6-Kip1p were directly applied to cleaved mica and shadowed as described below. To arrest cells in G1, α-factor peptide dissolved in 100% methanol was added to the cell culture at a final concentration of 5 μg/ml and the cells were incubated at 30 °C until microscopy showed that >98% of the cells had the characteristic schmoo morphology of a G1 arrest (incubations were approximately 3 h). The cells were harvested by filtration, washed with cold sterile water, divided into two aliquots, and resuspended in YPD media containing 0.1m hydroxyurea or 15 μg/ml nocodazole. The cells were incubated for 3 h to achieve an S-phase or mitotic arrest and cells were collected for analysis by sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation. Microtubules in the arrested cells were examined by immunofluorescence microscopy using anti-tubulin antibodies as described (25Rose M.D. Winston F. Hieter P. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1990Google Scholar). The Stokes radius was determined using size exclusion chromatography on a 1 × 49-cm Sephacryl S-400 (Sigma) column in Hepes 150 buffer (150 mmNaCl, 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 1 mmMgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 2% glycerol and protease inhibitors (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm benzamidine HCl, and 10 μg/ml each of leupeptin, chymostatin, and pepstatin A). ATP was included at 50 μm to prevent aggregation of Kip1p. The column was calibrated using protein standards with known diffusion coefficients, molecular weights, and Stokes radii (29Tanford C. Physical Chemistry of Macromolecules. Wiley, New York1961Google Scholar). The standards were chicken skeletal muscle myosin (Stokes radius 19 nm), bovine brain kinesin (9.6 nm), thyroglobulin (8.5 nm), and catalase (5.2 nm). The void volume was calculated using cesium chloride-purified supercoiled plasmid DNA. Peak positions were determined for His6-Kip1p and HA-Kip1p by immunoblotting. A calibration curve was obtained by plotting -log10 K½ versus Stokes radii, where K = (elution volume − void volume)/(total volume − void volume) (30Siegel L.M. Monty K.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1966; 112: 346-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (1547) Google Scholar). Sucrose density gradient centrifugation was performed using the same Hepes 150 buffer used for size exclusion chromatography. 200 μl of soluble yeast extract (1.2–2 mg of protein) or 200 μl of purified Kip1p from insect cells (50–100 ng of protein) was fractionated through a 12-ml 5–20% linear sucrose gradient in Hepes 150 buffer supplemented with protease inhibitors at 4 °C for 20 h at 285,000 ×g (Beckman SW40.Ti rotor). Following centrifugation, 0.5-ml fractions were collected, the protein was precipitated by adding trichloroacetic acid to 10%, subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting. The peak elution position for Kip1p was determined from independent runs using freshly prepared protein. The sedimentation coefficient for Kip1p was estimated from the calibration curve generated by plotting the sedimentation coefficient of protein standards versus their distance migrated. Protein standards were centrifuged in parallel for each centrifuge run, and included carbonic anhydrase (3.06 S), bovine serum albumin (4.4 S), fumarase (8.5 S), and catalase (11.3 S). Only data from protein standard plots with an r 2 value greater than 0.98 were used to calculate axial ratio, Perrin parameter, and native molecular weight for the Kip1p complex. To determine the sedimentation coefficient as a function of ionic strength, Kip1p and the standard proteins were analyzed in buffer supplemented with NaCl, as described (31Hackney D.D. Levitt J.D. Suhan J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8696-8701Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The native molecular weight was calculated from the sedimentation and diffusion coefficient using the Svedberg equation with Mr = R T s20,w/[D20,w(1 − vρ)] and r = 8.31 × 107erg deg−1 mol−1 (the ideal gas constant),T = 293 K and ρ = 0.9982 g cm−3(the density of water at 293 K). A partial specific volume (v) of 0.725 cm3 g−1 was used. The diffusion coefficient was calculated from the Stokes radius (Rs) according to the equationD20,w = RT/6Nπ Rs, with N = Avogadros number. The axial ratio, assuming Kip1p is a prolate ellipsoid, was estimated from the Perrin parameter as described (32Cantor C.R. Schimmel P.R. Biophysical Chemistry. W. H. Freeman, San Francisco, CA1980Google Scholar). His6-Kip1p isolated as described above from baculovirus-infected insect cells at a concentration of ∼2.5 μg/ml was applied to freshly cleaved mica and shadowed for electron microscopy as previous described (33Loesser K.E. Franzini-Armstrong C. J. Struct. Biol. 1990; 103: 48-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Briefly, mica adhered Kip1p was washed with 15–20 drops of 100 mm ammonium acetate, treated with 1% aqueous uranyl acetate for 30 s, and rinsed with 30% methanol. Excess methanol was removed leaving only a thin film behind and the specimen was frozen in liquid nitrogen. After freeze-drying in a Balzer's freeze-fracture machine, the specimen was shadowed with platinum at a 15° angle and replicated with carbon. Samples were viewed with a Philips electron microscope at 60 kV. The predicted amino acid sequence of Kip1p contains an NH2-terminal domain of 425 amino acids with high sequence similarity to the force generating domain of kinesin, followed by an additional 686 amino acids which do not exhibit close similarity to other members of the kinesin family or other known proteins (Fig.1). The 686-amino acid region contains several segments predicted to form coiled coils, and it is therefore likely that Kip1p forms a multimeric complex containing several copies of the Kip1p peptide and possibly additional yeast proteins. To address the subunit composition of the Kip1p complex, we compared the hydrodynamic properties of Kip1p isolated from yeast to Kip1p isolated from insect cells in which the KIP1 gene was expressed from a baculovirus vector. In yeast, the KIP1 gene was expressed from its native promoter to maintain the native protein level and preserve stoichiometry with any heterologous subunits, and experiments were performed with soluble extracts. For baculovirus-mediated expression, the KIP1 gene was tagged with six consecutive histidine residues at the NH2 terminus and the protein was partially purified by isolation of the nuclear fraction, followed by Ni-NTA affinity chromatography (Fig. 2). SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the baculovirus-expressed Kip1p gave an apparent molecular mass of ∼120 kDa, consistent with the molecular mass of 126,927 predicted from the sequence of His-taggedKIP1 gene. The wild type Kip1p from yeast and His-tagged Kip1p from baculovirus expression were detected by immunoblotting with antibody raised against the COOH-terminal 619 amino acids of Kip1p. When necessary for more sensitive detection, the KIP1 gene containing the hemagglutinin (HA) epitope sequence was used with the 12CA5 antibody. The HA-tagged and His-tagged KIP1 genes were functional in yeast, as tested in a complementation assay (3Roof D.M. Meluh P.B. Rose M.D. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 95-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar).Figure 2Expression and purification of Kip1p.

B, corresponding immunoblot of the samples shown in A, probed with polyclonal anti-Kip1p antibodies. The arrow indicates His6-Kip1p.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To estimate the sedimentation coefficients of the Kip1p complexes, we used sucrose gradient centrifugation. The sedimentation coefficients were measured by comparing the position of Kip1p in the gradient with the positions of a series of proteins with known sedimentation coefficients (Fig. 3). The concentration of the partially purified Kip1p from baculovirus expression was adjusted to give a signal in immunoblots approximately equal to that obtained for Kip1p from yeast. The sedimentation coefficient of wild type Kip1p from yeast was 8.2 ± 0.4 S (n = 6) and His-tagged Kip1p expressed from baculovirus was 7.9 ± 0.2 S (n = 6). The difference between these values is not significant (t test, p < 0.16). Since the sedimentation coefficient of Kip1p from yeast was close to that of the homomeric Kip1p complex from insect cells, we infer that soluble Kip1p in yeast extracts is most likely homomeric as well. When the 5.5-kDa HA epitope tag was present on the Kip1p expressed in yeast, the sedimentation coefficient increased to 8.6 ± 0.2 (n = 3). The Stokes radius and diffusion coefficient of the Kip1p complexes were measured after size exclusion chromatography (Fig.4). The Stokes radius of HA-tagged Kip1p from yeast was 13.4 nm and the Stokes radius of His-tagged Kip1p expressed from baculovirus was 12.5 nm. We were unable to use untagged Kip1p from yeast in size exclusion chromatography because adsorption of Kip1p to the column reduced its concentration below the level of detection with the polyclonal anti-Kip1p antibodies. The mean sedimentation coefficient and Stokes radius values were used to calculate the native molecular masses using the method of Siegel and Monty (30Siegel L.M. Monty K.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1966; 112: 346-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (1547) Google Scholar) and the results are summarized in TableI. The HA-tagged Kip1p complex from yeast was about 474 kDa and the His-tagged Kip1p complex obtained from insect cells was about 406 kDa. Comparison of the monomer molecular weight predicted from the amino acid sequence to the native molecular weight gave a subunit-to-complex ratio of 3.2 to 1 for the baculovirus-expressed protein and 3.6 to 1 for the yeast-expressed protein. The subunit composition which is consistent with the molecular weight estimates and the symmetrical bipolar structure observed by electron microscopy described below is that Kip1p, from yeast or expressed from baculovirus, is a homotetramer.Table IBiophysical properties of Kip1pPropertyaThe sedimentation coefficients and Stokes radii are expressed as the mean ± S.D. with the sample size (n) shown.

When uninduced, unrestrained negative supercoiling was organized into 32-kilobase pair (kb) topological domains. Upon induction, DNA supercoiling throughout the region was completely relaxed. Supercoiling was detected, however, when elongation was blocked before or following induction. The formation of transcription initiation complexes upon addition of dexamethasone decreased the domain size to 16 kb. During transcription the domain size was 9 kb, the length of one repeat. These results suggest that topological domain boundaries can be “functional” in nature, being established by the formation of activated and elongating transcription complexes.

These results suggest that topological domain boundaries can be “functional” in nature, being established by the formation of activated and elongating transcription complexes. Topological domains, often referred to as chromosomal loops, have been detected in many organisms including Escherichia coli(1Sinden R.R. Pettijohn D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 224-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar), Drosophila (2Jupe E.R. Sinden R.R. Cartwright I.L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 2628-2633Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), and humans (3Jackson D.A. Dickinson P. Cook P.R. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 567-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar) (for review see Ref. 4Freeman L.A. Garrard W.T. Crit. Rev. Eukaryotic Gene Expression. 1992; 2: 165-209PubMed Google Scholar). The formation of a topological domain requires restraint of the DNA helix such that rotation of one strand of the DNA double helix around the other is prevented. Consequently, DNA within a topological domain can contain a linking number deficit that is manifest as unrestrained superhelical energy (for review see Ref. 5Sinden R.R. DNA Structure and Function. Academic Press, San Diego1994Google Scholar). Domain boundaries may result from the attachment of the DNA at specialized sites (i.e. MARs 1The abbreviations used are:MARmatrix attachment regionSARscaffold attachment regionMMTVmouse mammary tumor virusMe2SOdimethyl sulfoxideCHEFclamped homogeneous electric fieldBPVbovine papilloma virusLTRlong terminal repeatkbkilobase pair(s)bpbase pair(s)Xlcross-linksPIPES1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid or SARs) (6Cockerill P.N.

Recently a bipartite sequence element has been identified within matrix attachment regions that may be important in chromosome organization or function via these sites (8van Drunen C.N. Sewalt R.G.A.B. Oosterling R.W. Weisbeek P.J. Smeekens S.C.M. van Driel R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 2924-2930Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Alternatively, topological domain boundaries may be functional in nature resulting from the attachment of functional proteins such as RNA or DNA polymerase complexes to the nuclear membrane (9Jackson D.A. Dolle A. Robertson G. Cook P.R. Cell Biol. Int. Rep. 1992; 16: 687-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). For example, in Salmonella typhimurium membrane attachment of TetA leads to the formation of a topological domain boundary defined by the transcriptional complex where the RNA is being translated (10Chen D. Bowater R. Dorman C.J. Lilley D.M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 8784-8788Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In addition, in yeast, telomeric sequences can act as functional anchor points for chromosome organization to provide blocks to the transmission of supercoils across the block (11Mirabella A. Gartenberg M.R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 523-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Other DNA·enzyme complexes in bacteria, such as that created by UvrAB can also act as a boundary to supercoiling (12Koo H.S. Claassen L. Grossman L. Liu L.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 1212-1216Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). matrix attachment region scaffold attachment region mouse mammary tumor virus dimethyl sulfoxide clamped homogeneous electric field bovine papilloma virus long terminal repeat kilobase pair(s) base pair(s) cross-links 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid DNA in living bacterial cells is organized with a linking number deficit leading to a state of unrestrained negative supercoiling (1Sinden R.R.

Cell. 1980; 21: 773-783Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Although, DNA is negatively supercoiled in bacterial cells, not all supercoiling is unrestrained. About half the supercoils in DNA inEscherichia coli are restrained, possibly by the wrapping of DNA around histone-like proteins (14Pettijohn D.E. Pfenninger O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 1331-1335Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 15Broyles S. Pettijohn D.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 187: 47-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 16Drlica K. Rouviere-Yaniv J.

Consequently, in vivo measurements of levels of supercoiling are about half that measured for the purified chromosome (19Bliska J.R. Cozzarelli N.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 194: 205-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 20McClellan J.A. Boublikova P. Palecek E. Lilley D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Initial studies of supercoiling in eukaryotic cells failed to detect unrestrained supercoiling averaged over the entire chromosome (13Sinden R.R. Carlson J.O. Pettijohn D.E. Cell. 1980; 21: 773-783Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar), presumably due to the restraint of supercoils through the organization of DNA into nucleosomes. However, analyses of individual genes inDrosophila, mouse, and human cells have revealed the presence of unrestrained supercoiling associated with gene regions (2Jupe E.R. Sinden R.R. Cartwright I.L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 2628-2633Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar,23Ljungman M. Hanawalt P.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 3151-3158Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), whereas DNA outside the functional hsp70 domain at locus 87ADrosophila was completely relaxed (2Jupe E.R. Sinden R.R. Cartwright I.L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 2628-2633Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). However, a relationship between transcription or transcriptional activation and unrestrained supercoiling remains to be clearly established. For example, the level of supercoiling within a transcriptionally active hygromycin resistance gene introduced into different regions of the human genome can vary from highly supercoiled to relaxed (26Kramer P.R. Sinden R.R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 3151-3158Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The mouse mammary tumor virus promoter provides a model system in which the nucleosomal organization and nucleosomal reorganization upon transcription activation are extremely well characterized (27Hager G.L. Archer T.K. Fragoso G. Bresnick E.H. Tsukagoshi Y. John S. Smith C.L. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1993; 58: 63-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Transcription rapidly follows the addition of the glucocorticoid hormone dexamethasone, allowing analysis of the chromatin under conditions of gene repression or activation. When stably introduced into the genome, the mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) promoter acquires six positioned nucleosome families (28Richard-Foy H. Hager G.L. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 2321-2328Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar), positioned over the binding sites for the glucocorticoid receptor and associated factors involved in promoter activation. Steroid hormone induction of the MMTV promoter with dexamethasone renders the DNA sequences associated with the B nucleosome family accessible to restriction endonuclease digestion (28Richard-Foy H. Hager G.L. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 2321-2328Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). The hormone-dependent increased nucleosome accessibility is believed to be mechanistically responsible for the loading of transcription factors and the subsequent induction of transcriptional activation (29Archer T.K. Cordingley M.G. Wolford R.G. Hager G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 688-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar, 30Archer T.K. LeFebvre P. Wolford R.G. Hager G.L. Science. 1992; 255: 1573-1576Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). The increase in enzyme accessibility of nucleosome B in a stably integrated MMTV promoter is 15–20% in one mouse cell line, suggesting that transcriptional activation of the promoter occurs at similar levels (31Fragoso G. John S. Roberts M.S. Hager G.L. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1933-1947Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). The well characterized MMTV promoter and the availability of a cell line containing multiple tandem copies of this promoter afford an excellent system in which to study the effects of gene activation and transcriptional elongation on the level of DNA supercoiling and the number of topological domains. We have studied the change in supercoiling and topological domain size in a DNA region containing approximately 200 copies of the MMTV promoter 5′ of theha-v-ras gene to understand the role of chromatin organization and supercoiling on gene expression. The transcriptional state of the gene influences the topological domain size and the level of unrestrained supercoiling. The average domain size within the tandem array of MMTV promoter-driven genes changes upon transcriptional activation and elongation suggesting that transcription complexes are functional topological domain boundaries. Cell line 3134 contains approximately 200 copies of the 9-kb fragment (pM18D) of the plasmid pM18 (28Richard-Foy H. Hager G.L.

Cells were maintained as a monolayer in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. To incorporate BrdUrd into the DNA, cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium + 10% fetal bovine serum containing 10 mm bromo-2-deoxyuridine. At this concentration, 45% of the thymidines were substituted with bromo-2-deoxyuridine in hamster cells (32Kaufman E.R. Davidson R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 4982-4986Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). 24 h before use, cells were incubated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium lacking phenol red and containing 10% charcoal-stripped serum (Hyclone). For transcriptional activation, cells were treated with dexamethasone at a concentration of 0.5 μm for 1 h, either before or after a 60-min treatment with 50 μg/ml of α-amanitin (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Genomic DNA from approximately 1.2 × 106 3134 cells, lysed in agarose blocks, was digested overnight at 37 °C with various restriction enzymes. For clamped homogeneous electric field (CHEF) gel analysis, the digested DNAs were separated for 83 h in a 0.8% agarose gel equilibrated with 1X TAE buffer (0.04 m Tris base, 0.04 mglacial acetic acid, 0.001 m EDTA) in a Bio-Rad CHEF Mapper XA pulsed field electrophoresis system with the auto algorithm supplied by the manufacturer for optimal separation of 1 to 3 mega base pair DNAs. Following electrophoresis, location of the Hansenula wingei chromosomal marker was determined by ethidium bromide staining. Genomic DNA was transferred to a nylon membrane (Amersham Hybond-N+) by capillary action under alkali conditions. This blot was hybridized for 48 h under moderate stringency (2× SSC (0.3m NaCl, 0.03 m sodium citrate, pH 7.0); 5× Denhardt's solution (0.1% Ficoll (Mr 400,000), 0.1% polyvinyl pyrrolidone (Mr 400,000), and 0.1% bovine serum albumin); 50% deionized formamide; 1% SDS; 100 μg/ml denatured sheared salmon sperm; 55 °C) with a radioactive RNA probe derived from the 69% transforming portion of bovine papilloma virus (BPV; sense strand position 1234–3224 of BPV-1 DNA (GenBankTM accession number X02346)). The blot was washed at 42 °C in 0.2× SSC, 0.1% SDS following treatment with RNase A (25 μg/ml) and RNase T1 (10 μg/ml) at room temperature in 2× SSC. Subsequently, the blot was placed on a PhosphorImager plate to collect the radioactive signal. For field inversion gel electrophoresis, the genomic DNAs digested in plugs as described above were separated in a 1% agarose gel in 0.5× TBE buffer (0.045 m Tris base, 0.045 m boric acid, 0.001 m EDTA) using the auto algorithm feature optimal for separation of 2- to 50-kilobase pair DNA. Reference marker DNA in this case was HindIII-digested lambda DNA (range of fragments, 8.3 to 48.5 kb). The separated genomic DNA was analyzed by hybridizing to the BPV RNA probe. The S1 analyses were performed as described previously (33Pennie W.D. Hager G.L. Smith C.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2125-2134Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Briefly, total cellular RNA was extracted by phenol-chloroform, precipitated with ethanol, and dissolved in H2O. Single-stranded MMTV probes were synthesized by primer extension in the presence of [α-32P]ATP, using an oligonucleotide priming from +85 in the long terminal repeat (LTR) (5′-TCTGGAAAGTGAAGGATAAGTGACGA), and SacI-cut pM18 as a template (end point at −105) (34Ostrowski M.C. Richard-Foy H. Wolford R.G. Berard D.S. Hager G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1983; 3: 2045-2057Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The probes were purified by electrophoresis in denaturing gels, recovered by the “crush-and-soak” method, and 105 cpm were hybridized to 10 μg of RNA in 80% formamide, 0.2 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 40 mm PIPES, pH 6.4, for 6–12 h at 37 °C. Hybrids were treated with 100 units of S1 nuclease for 1 h at room temperature, in 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm zinc acetate, 30 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.6, and then extracted with phenol-chloroform and precipitated with ethanol. Digestion products were resolved in denaturing 8% acrylamide sequencing gels. Visualization of the separated fragment was achieved with a PhosphorImager, and quantitation performed with the ImageQuant program (Molecular Dynamics). Preparation of nuclei, restriction enzyme treatment, and analysis by primer extension was performed as described previously (31Fragoso G. John S. Roberts M.S. Hager G.L. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1933-1947Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Briefly, treated or untreated cells were scraped into cold phosphate-buffered saline and homogenized with a dounce (“A” pestle) in 0.3 m sucrose, 3 mm CaCl2, 2 mm magnesium acetate, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.8, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1% Triton X-100. The homogenate was diluted 1:1 with digestion buffer (25% glycerol, 5 mm magnesium acetate, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.8, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm EDTA), and centrifuged through a pad containing dilution buffer for 15 min at 1,000 × g and 4 °C. Nuclear pellets were resuspended in 25% glycerol, 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.8, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol. 10 μg of DNA equivalents of nuclei was restricted with 100 units of SacI, for 15 min at 37 °C in 50 mm NaCl, 50 mmTris-Cl, pH 8, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mmβ-mercaptoethanol (35Workman J.L. Langmore J.P. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 4731-4738Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) extracted with phenol-chloroform, and precipitated with ethanol. The extracted DNA was cut to completion withDpnII before primer extension to determine the fractional cleavage. To obtain a linear amplification of the signal, primer extensions with Taq polymerase were thermally cycled in 50 mm KCl, 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.8, 200 μm dNTP, 3.5 mm MgCl2, 0.1% Triton X-100, using an oligonucleotide priming from +27 in the LTR (5′-ACAAGAGGTGAATGTTAGGACTGTTGC). Extension products were extracted with phenol-chloroform and precipitated with ethanol before electrophoresis in sequencing gels and analysis in the PhosphorImager. Following growth in the presence of bromo-2-deoxyuridine, the DNA nicking was accomplished by exposure of the cells to 313-nm light using a mercury vapor lamp with a K2CrO4/NaOH filter as described previously (26Kramer P.R. Sinden R.R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 3151-3158Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 36Sinden R.R. Pettijohn D.E. J. Mol.

Subsequent treatment with psoralen and 360-nm light, and DNA purification protocols were described previously (26Kramer P.R. Sinden R.R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 3151-3158Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). For Southern analysis, 7 μg of chromosomal DNA were digested to completion at 37 °C with 100 units of SpeI in 60 μl of restriction buffer. After digestion, DNA was purified and treated with glyoxal aldehyde and dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO) as described previously (26Kramer P.R. Sinden R.R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 3151-3158Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). DNA samples were separated on a 1% agarose gel in 10 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.0) as described (40McMaster G.K. Carmichael G.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 4835-4838Crossref PubMed Scopus (1727) Google Scholar), the gel was denatured, and the DNA was transferred to a nylon membrane (26Kramer P.R. Sinden R.R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 3151-3158Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). For hybridization analysis of the MMTV promoter, a 3.0-kbSpeI fragment was isolated from plasmid pM18 (28Richard-Foy H. Hager G.L. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 2321-2328Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar) and labeled with [α-32P]CTP using the random priming method (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The membrane was hybridized at 65 °C for 12 h, washed twice with 2× SSC (300 mm NaCl, 30 mm sodium citrate, pH 7.0) containing 0.1% SDS at 65 °C for 60 min. Quantitation was completed using a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager using ImageQuant software. The fraction of DNA cross-linked (Fx) was calculated by dividing the area of the cross-linked peak by the sum of the area for the cross-linked and noncross-linked peaks. The cross-links per kilobase (Xl/kb) were calculated using the formula Xl/kb = −ln(1−Fx)/S, as described (24Jupe E.R. Sinden R.R. Cartwright I.L. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1067-1075Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), where S is the size of the restriction fragment (S = 3.0 kb for the SpeI fragment of pM18). RI/Nvalues represent an average of two Southern blots each from a minimum of three separate experiments. The ratio of the mean cross-linking rate in intact verses relaxed domains (RI/N = Xl/kbI/Xl/kbN) reflects the level of unrestrained supercoiling (24Jupe E.R. Sinden R.R. Cartwright I.L. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1067-1075Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). An unpaired, two-tailed, ttest was performed with these RI/N values, and a significant difference is indicated if p ≤ 0.05. The frequency of single strand breaks introduced by BrdUrd photolysis was determined as described previously (26Kramer P.R. Sinden R.R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 3151-3158Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) with the following modifications: 5 ml of 5–20% alkaline sucrose gradients were centrifuged at 35,000 rpm in a Beckman SW55Ti rotor for 4 h. Thirty equal volume fractions were collected from the bottom of the tube onto 3-cm square sections of a nylon membrane. After baking at 80 °C for 2 h, the membrane was hybridized with the 3.0-kb SpeI fragment32P-labeled probe of pM18D containing the MMTV promoter and v-ras gene (Fig. 1). The membrane was washed twice with 2× SSC at 65 °C for 60 min. The membrane was dried then the 3-cm sections were placed into vials with scintillation fluid and counted for radioactivity. Molecular weights of the single strand DNA fragments (Z) were calculated (41Rupp W.D. Howard-Flanders P. J. Mol. Biol. 1968; 31: 291-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (733) Google Scholar), and the number of single strand breaks per tandem array was calculated using a molecular weight of 338 g/mol bp and 8 × 106 bp per tandem array. Cell line 904.13 was originally established by transformation of C127 cells with a bovine papilloma virus vector containing the MMTV promoter driving expression of the ha-v-ras gene (Fig.1 C). Cell line 3134 was derived from the 904.13 line after a spontaneous event resulted in the integration and amplification of the episome. CHEF gel analysis (Fig.1 A) of DNA from this cell line with three different restriction enzymes, which do not cut the circular DNA construct, resulted in fragments ranging in size from 1.8 to 2.2 × 106 base pairs. Partial digestion with a single-cut enzyme produced a ladder of fragments with a repeat size of 9 kb (Fig.1 B). These data indicate that the cell contains a large tandem array with approximately 200 head to tail copies of the original 9-kb fragment (Fig. 1 C). Details of the 9-kb repeat unit are diagrammed in Fig. 1 D. A 3,026-bp SpeI fragment encompassing the MMTV promoter was used to assess the level of unrestrained supercoiling within the inserts of the tandem array (Fig. 1 D). This fragment contains the entire MMTV LTR, and most of the transcribed region of theras sequence. The percentage of MMTV templates activated by dexamethasone in this cell line was assessed by hypersensitivity toSacI cleavage, which cuts in the nucleosome B region of the promoter (Fig. 1 D) (29Archer T.K. Cordingley M.G. Wolford R.G. Hager G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 688-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar, 31Fragoso G. John S. Roberts M.S. Hager G.L.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 273-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). In a representative experiment, about 7–8% of the SacI sites were accessible in control cells or in cells treated with α-amanitin (Fig.2; Control andAmanitin). Treatment with dexamethasone resulted in an increase in the accessibility of this region, approximately 23% of the promoters were cut (Fig. 2; Dex). This represents an increase of 0.15–0.16 in the fractional cleavage, in agreement with previous studies (31Fragoso G. John S. Roberts M.S. Hager G.L. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1933-1947Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 42Bresnick E.H. Bustin M. Marsaud V. Richard-Foy H. Hager G.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 273-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar) and suggesting that 15–20% of the promoters are active at the time of the assay. In addition, treatment with dexamethasone following a 1-h pretreatment of the cells with α-amanitin resulted in a similar increase in fractional cleavage (Fig. 2; Dex + Amanitin), indicating that remodeling of the Nuc-B region occurs independently of transcription, as suggested by others (43Truss M. Bartsch J. Schelbert A. Hache R.J. Beato M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1737-1751Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). α-Amanitin inhibits MMTV-driven transcription under our incubation conditions as illustrated by a representative experiment in Fig.3. Specific transcription, or more properly RNA accumulation, was examined with an S1 protection assay. 3134 cells treated with dexamethasone for 1 h displayed a 7–8-fold increase in RNA detected relative to uninduced cells (Fig. 3;Control and Dex), comparable with previous determinations in the parental 904.13 cell line (44Archer T.K. Lee H.L. Cordingley M.G. Mymryk J.S. Fragoso G. Berard D.S. Hager G.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 568-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Incubation of the cells with 50 μg/ml α-amanitin for 1 h before dexamethasone treatment resulted in approximately a 1.5–1.7-fold increase in transcript levels relative to control cells (Fig. 3;Amanitin + Dex). This represents a substantial 90–95% decrease in the steady state RNA level induced by dexamethasone after 1 h. A 50–70% decrease in the basal transcription of uninduced templates was also observed in cells treated with α-amanitin without dexamethasone (Fig. 3;Amanitin); however, the quantitation in this case is not as accurate because of the low RNA levels. The rate of Me3-psoralen cross-linking to DNA depends on two parameters: the accessibility of the DNA and the level of unrestrained supercoiling in the DNA. Accessibility is dependent upon the extent of association of DNA with nucleosomes or other proteins that prevent Me3-psoralen binding (37Sinden R.R. Ussery D.W. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 212: 319-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Psoralen accessibility of the MMTV promoter in this mouse cell was analyzed in four sets of cells: untreated (control) cells where theha-v-ras gene was inactive; dexamethasone-treated cells that were transcriptionally active; cells treated with dexamethasone followed by α-amanitin, in which transcription elongation was allowed to proceed and then was blocked; and cells treated with α-amanitin followed by dexamethasone, in which the promoter was activated but transcription elongation was prevented. Each set of cells was treated with psoralen and exposed to increasing doses of 360-nm light. The DNA was irreversibly denatured as described under “Experimental Procedures,” and the cross-linked and noncross-linked molecules were separated on a native agarose gel (Fig.4 A). The cross-links per kilobase (Xl/kb), calculated from the intensities of the cross-linked (Xl) and noncross-linked (non-Xl) SpeI fragments (Fig.4 A), showed a linear relationship as a function of light exposure for each set of cells (Fig. 4 B). As shown in Fig.4 B, the cross-linking rates for the cell lines were linear to at least 12 kJ/m2. The molecular bases for the slight decrease in rate of binding in cells treated with dexamethasone (permeability or accessibility changes) was not investigated. In the experiments to determine the level of unrestrained negative superhelical energy, a dose of 6 kJ/m2 of 360-nm light was chosen because it is within the linear range of the cross-linking reaction. Unrestrained supercoiling was determined by comparing the Xl/kb at a constant dose of psoralen and light within the SpeI fragment before and after the chromosomal DNA was nicked by BrdUrd photolysis. In Fig. 5 A the intensity of both the Xl and non-Xl species decreased at higher doses of nicking but proportionally the Xl band decreases faster (determined by PhosphorImager analysis). Thus, the rate of cross-linking (or Xl/kbversus dose) decreased at higher doses of 313-nm light indicating the presence of unrestrained supercoiling. The measurement of supercoiling is presented as RI/N as described previously (24Jupe E.R. Sinden R.R. Cartwright I.L. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1067-1075Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 26Kramer P.R. Sinden R.R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 3151-3158Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar)). A value of RI/N = 1 indicates that no unrestrained supercoiling was detected, whereas anRI/N > 1 indicates the presence of negative supercoiling. All RI/N values in Fig.5 B represent the average from at least six independent determinations from three separate experiments. A moderately high level of unrestrained superhelical tension (RI/N = 1.55) was present in the promoter region in cells with an uninduced basal level of transcription of the MMTV promoter (Fig. 5 B,Control). This level of supercoiling was lower than that observed in the Drosophila hsp70 or rRNA genes (24Jupe E.R. Sinden R.R. Cartwright I.L. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1067-1075Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), but higher than that seen in a hygromycin gene in human cells (26Kramer P.R. Sinden R.R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 3151-3158Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). After dexamethasone treatment for 1 h, the overall level of negative superhelical energy"
https://openalex.org/W2321320031,"Chronic overexpression of the oncogenic form of Ras is a potent inhibitor of skeletal myogenesis. However, the intracellular signaling pathways that mediate the repressive actions of Ras on myogenic differentiation have yet to be identified. We examined the role of Raf-mediated signaling as a modulator of avian myogenesis. Raf overexpression elicited pronounced effects on both myoblasts and mature myocytes. Most notably, the embryonic chick myoblasts overexpressing a constitutively active form of Raf (RCAS-Raf CAAX or RCAS-Raf BXB) fail to form the large multinucleated myofibers characteristic of myogenic cultures. While residual myofibers were apparent in the RCAS-Raf BXB and RCAS-Raf CAAX infected cultures, these fibers had an atrophic phenotype. The altered morphology is not a result of reinitiation of the myonuclei cell cycle nor is it due to apoptosis. Furthermore, the mononucleated myoblasts misexpressing Raf BXB are differentiation-defective due to overt MAPK activity. Supplementation of the culture media with the MAPK kinase (MEK) inhibitor, PD98059, caused a reversal of the phenotype and allowed the formation of multinucleated myofibers at levels comparable to controls. Our results indicate that the Raf/MEK/MAPK axis is intact in chick myoblasts and that persistent activation of this signaling cascade is inhibitory to myogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2043823094,"Molecular properties of the NQO9 subunit of Paracoccus denitrificans NDH-1, which is predicted to contain 2×[4Fe-4S] clusters, were investigated using recombinant expression techniques and EPR spectroscopy. The full-length form of NQO9 subunit co-expressed with thioredoxin in Escherichia coli at ambient temperature was found dominantly in the cytoplasmic membrane with low amplification. Genetic deletion of relatively hydrophobic and less conserved N-terminal stretches (30 or 40 amino acid residues long) of the NQO9 subunit resulted in the overexpression of the truncated soluble form of the subunit in a high yield in the cytoplasm. The purified soluble form of the NQO9 subunit contained only a small quantity of Fe and S2− (2.0–2.2 mol each per mol of subunit). However, the iron-sulfur content was considerably increased by in vitro reconstitution. The reconstituted NQO9 subunit contained 7.6–7.7 mol each of Fe and S2− per molecule and exhibited optical absorption spectra similar to those of 2×[4Fe-4S] ferredoxins. Two sets of relatively broad axial-type EPR signals with different temperature dependence and power saturation profile were detected in the dithionite-reduced preparations at a low temperature range (8–18 K). Due to a negative shift (<600 mV) of the apparent redox midpoint potential of the iron-sulfur clusters in the soluble form of the truncated NQO9 subunit, the following two possible cases could not be discriminated: (i) two sets of EPR signals arise from two distinct species of tetranuclear iron-sulfur clusters with two intrinsically different spectral parameters g∥,⊥ = 2.05, ∼1.93, andg∥,⊥ = 2.08, ∼1.90, and respective slow (P½ = 8 milliwatts) and fast (P½ = 342 milliwatts) spin relaxation; (ii) two clusters exhibit similar intrinsic EPR spectra (g∥,⊥ = 2.05, ∼1.93) with slow spin relaxation.

The mitochondrial enzyme is termed complex I, and the bacterial enzyme is called NDH-1. Both enzyme complexes catalyze the Reaction 1. NADH+Q+H++nH++NADin+→NAD++QH2+nHout+(n=3–5)Reaction 1 The reduction of Q by NADH is coupled to proton translocation across the membrane generating an electrochemical potential. The number (n) of pumped proton coupled to the electron transfer from NADH to Q has not yet been conclusively determined. Reaction 1 is reversible such that under certain conditions the enzyme complex is capable of catalyzing the reversed reaction (reverse electron flow). It is generally accepted that mitochondrial complex I and bacterial NDH-1 share many molecular and enzymatic properties. Both enzyme complexes are composed of multiple subunits. Mitochondrial complex I is composed of at least 42 dissimilar subunits (1Walker J.E. Q. Rev.

Yano T. Di Bernardo S. Matsuno-Yagi A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1364: 125-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Both complex I and NDH-1 contain a non-covalently bound FMN and a number of iron-sulfur clusters as electron transfer components. Both enzyme complexes are inhibited by a number of inhibitors (rotenone, piericidin A, capsaicin, pyridaben, etc.) in a similar fashion (13Miyoshi H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1364: 236-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 14Degli Esposti M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1364: 222-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar, 15Schuler F. Yano T.

These results indicate that bacterial NDH-1 are counterparts of mitochondrial complex I.

Previously, EPR spectroscopic studies have revealed that mitochondrial complex I and several bacterial NDH-1 contain at least five EPR-detectable clusters (designated N1a, N1b, N2, N3, and N4) (16Ohnishi T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1364: 186-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). N1a and N1b are [2Fe-2S] clusters, and all others are [4Fe-4S] clusters (17Ohnishi T. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1993; 25: 325-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The cluster N2 has pH-dependentEm in the physiological pH range and the highest midpoint redox potential among clusters in the complex I (18Ingledew W.J. Ohnishi T. Biochem. J. 1980; 186: 111-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). It has been suggested, therefore, that the cluster N2 plays an important role in electron transfer to quinone and probably in the proton translocation (19Ohnishi T. Salerno J.C. Spiro T.G. Iron-Sulfur Proteins. Vol. 4. Wiley Publishing Co., New York1982: 285-327Google Scholar, 20Dutton P.L. Moser C.C. Sled V.D. Daldal F. Ohnishi T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1364: 245-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 21Brandt U. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1318: 79-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). We have attempted to individually express the putative cofactor-binding subunits of the P. denitrificans NDH-1 to identify the location of the cofactors. Expression study of the flavoprotein subcomplex that is composed of the NQO1 and NQO2 subunits has shown that the FMN molecule, a primary electron acceptor from NADH, seems to be located in the NQO1 or between the NQO1 and NQO2 subunits (22Yano T. Sled' V.D. Ohnishi T. Yagi T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5907-5913Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Tetranuclear cluster N3 is housed in NQO1 subunit. Expression study of the sole NQO2 subunit has provided the supporting evidence that the cluster N1a is located in the NQO2 subunit (23Yano T. Sled' V.D. Ohnishi T. Yagi T. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 494-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 24Crouse B.R. Yano T. Finnegan M.G. Yagi T. Johnson M.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21030-21036Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with a novel binding motif (C96 X4C101-C137 X3C141) (25Yano T. Sled V.D. Ohnishi T. Yagi T. FEBS Lett. 1994; 354: 160-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Location of clusters N1b and N4 have tentatively been assigned to the NQO3 subunit (26Yano T. Yagi T. Sled' V.D. Ohnishi T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18264-18270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The subunit contains 11 fully conserved cysteine residues among its homologues including one [4Fe-4S] cluster-binding motif. It has also been suggested that the NQO3 subunit contains an additional [4Fe-4S] cluster with a unique spin state (26Yano T. Yagi T. Sled' V.D. Ohnishi T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18264-18270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). E. coli and T. thermophilus NQO3 subunits seem to contain an additional [2Fe-2S] cluster (tentatively designated cluster N1c) (11Yano T. Chu S.S. Sled' V.D. Ohnishi T. Yagi T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4201-4211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 27Leif H. Sled V.D. Ohnishi T. Weiss H. Friedrich T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 230: 538-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Consequently, our subunit localization analysis of these redox components has led us to propose that the iron-sulfur cluster N2 may be associated with either the NQO6 or the NQO9 subunit (11Yano T. Chu S.S. Sled' V.D. Ohnishi T. Yagi T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4201-4211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 28Takano S. Yano T. Yagi T. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 9120-9127Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The NQO6 subunit and its homologues have 4 conserved cysteine residues (Cys53, Cys54, Cys118, and Cys148; P. denitrificans numbering) (28Takano S. Yano T. Yagi T. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 9120-9127Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), whose arrangement is similar to that for a proximal [4Fe-4S] cluster in the small subunit of [Ni-Fe] hydrogenases (29Masui R. Wakabayashi S. Matsubara H. Hatefi Y. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1991; 110: 575-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 30Albracht S.P.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1144: 221-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 31Volbeda A. Charon M.-H. Piras C. Hatchikian E.C. Frey M. Fontecilla-Camps J.C. Nature. 1995; 373: 580-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (1362) Google Scholar). Therefore, the NQO6 subunit is anticipated to harbor a [4Fe-4S] cluster. Recently, the NQO6 subunit and its mitochondrial counterpart, PSST subunit, have been identified as a specific target of structurally diverse inhibitors such as pyridaben, rotenone, and piericidin A (15Schuler F. Yano T. Di Bernardo S. Yagi T. Yankovskaya V. Singer T.P. Casida J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4149-4153Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). This finding suggests that the NQO6 subunit plays an important role in electron transfer step from cluster N2 to quinone. The NQO9 subunit, on the other hand, contains two [4Fe-4S] cluster-binding motifs (C64 XXC67 XXC70 XXXC74P75–C103 XXC106 XXC109 XXXC113P114) similar to primordial 2×[4Fe-4S] ferredoxins (32Yagi T. Yano T. Matsuno-Yagi A. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1993; 25: 339-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 33Matsubara H. Saeki K. Adv. Inorg. Chem. 1992; 38: 223-280Crossref Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 34Johnson M.K. King R.B. Encyclopedia of Inorganic Chemistry. John Wiley & Sons Ltd., Chichester, UK1994: 1896-1915Google Scholar). Therefore, it is likely that the NQO9 subunit contains 2×[4Fe-4S] clusters. However, no experimental data are currently available concerning properties of these two subunits (28Takano S. Yano T. Yagi T. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 9120-9127Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In the present study, the NQO9 subunit of the P. denitrificans NDH-1 was characterized by homologous expression techniques and EPR spectroscopy. When relatively hydrophobic and less conserved stretches were removed from its N and C termini, the truncated forms of the subunits could be expressed as soluble proteins in the cytoplasm of E. coli. Although the purified subunit contained substoichiometric amounts of iron-sulfur clusters, they were chemically reconstituted into the subunit. Chemical and physicochemical analyses of the reconstituted NQO9 subunit demonstrated that the subunit contains 2×[4Fe-4S] clusters. For the full-length NQO9 subunit expression, thenqo9 gene was mutagenized by oligonucleotide mutagenesis by Künkel et al. (35Künkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4540) Google Scholar). Briefly, anNheI/NotI DNA fragment (800 base pairs) that contained the entire region of nqo9 gene was digested from pXT2-b, blunt-ended with a Klenow fragment, and then subcloned inSmaI site of pTZ18U cloning vector. A clone that contained the nqo9 gene in a particular orientation was selected and designated as pTZ18(NQO9). An NdeI restriction recognition site was introduced around the translation initiation site with an oligonucleotide NQO9(NdeI), 5′-GGA GCG TTTCATATG GCC TTC GAT TTC GCC-3′ (where italics indicate changes from P. denitrificans DNA and underlines indicate the newly introduced restriction site). The construct containing the NdeI site was verified by sequencing and was designated as pTZ18(NQO9NdeI). TheNdeI/BamHI fragment (520 base pairs) was retrieved from pTZ18(NQO9NdeI) and ligated with pET11a or pET16b expression vectors, respectively. The final constructs were confirmed by restriction enzyme digestion and were named as pET11a(NQO9) and pET16b(NQO9). We employed PCR methods for the construction of the truncated forms of the NQO9 subunit. The following oligonucleotides were synthesized: NQO9F1, 5′-TTT CATATG GCC TTC GAT TTC GCC CGT GCG ACC-3′; NQO9F2, 5′-TAT CAT ATG TCG CCC AAG CCG ACG CTG AAC TAC C-3′; NQO9F3, 5′-TAC CAT ATG GAA AAG GGC CCG CTG TCG CCG CGC TTC-3′; NQO9R1, 5′-CGT GGA TCCTCA TCT GTA GGG CGC ATC CAG TTG C-3′; NQO9R2: 5′-CGT GGA TCC TCA GGC CTC CCA GCG TTC GCC GTT CG-3′; NQO9R3, 5′-CGT GGA TCC TCA CTT CTG CTT GTC GTA GAA CAG CTC-3′. Newly introduced restriction enzyme recognition sites have been underlined (CATATG for NdeI and GGATCC forBamHI). Italicized letters are the nucleotides that had been altered from the original sequences. pTZ18(NQO9) plasmid was used as a template. DNA was amplified in 50 μl of reaction mixture containing 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 50 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.001% (w/v) gelatin, 200 μm each of dNTPs (dATP, dGTP, dCTP, and dTTP), 1.0 mm each of sense and antisense primers, 100 ng/ml pTZ18(NQO9) plasmid, and 2.5 units of Pfu polymerase (Stratagene). The amplification was performed in a thermocycler with a reaction program that consisted of one cycle of hot start (94 °C for 10 min and 60 °C for 5 min), 35 amplification cycles that were composed of denaturing (94 °C for 1 min), annealing (50 °C for 1.5 min), and elongation (72 °C for 2 min), and finally one cycle of termination (72 °C for 10 min). Amplified DNA fragments were purified with QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen) and run on a 1.0% (w/v) agarose gel. DNA fragments with expected molecular size were excised and purified from the gel with QIAquick Gel Extraction kit (Qiagen) and then subcloned into pCR-script II vector (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The cloned DNAs were verified by sequencing of both strands. Each construct was designated pCR(NQO9Δ1–30), pCR(NQO9 Δ1–40), pCR(NQO9Δ151–163), pCR(PdNQO9 Δ141–163), pCR(NQO9 Δ1–30, Δ151–163), pCR(NQO9 Δ1–30, Δ141–163), pCR(NQO9 Δ1–40, Δ151–163), and pCR(NQO9 Δ1–40, Δ141–163), respectively. NdeI/BamHI fragments were retrieved from each construct and then ligated with pET11a and pET16b expression plasmids. The final constructs were designated pET11a(NQO9 Δ1–30), pET11a(NQO9 Δ1–40), pET11a(NQO9 Δ151–163), pET11a(NQO9 Δ141–163), pET11a(NQO9 Δ1–30, Δ151–163), pET11a(NQO9 Δ1–30, Δ141–163), pET11a(NQO9 Δ1–40, Δ151–163), pET11a(NQO9 Δ1–40, Δ141–163) pET16b(NQO9 Δ1–30), pET16b(NQO9 Δ1–40), pET16b (NQO9 Δ151–163), pET16b(NQO9 Δ141–163), pET16b(NQO9 Δ1–30, Δ151–163), pET16b(NQO9 Δ1–30, Δ141–163), pET16b(NQO9 Δ1–40, Δ151–163), and pET16b(NQO9 Δ1–40, Δ141–163). Expression procedures were based on Takanoet al. (28Takano S. Yano T. Yagi T. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 9120-9127Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). E. coli strain BL21(DE3)pTrx was transformed with the respective expression vectors. A single, well isolated colony was picked up and inoculated in 2 ml of 2× YT medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 35 μg/ml chloramphenicol and cultivated at 37 °C. The grown culture was transferred to 500 ml of TB medium containing 100 μg/ml carbenicillin and 35 μg/ml chloramphenicol, 100 μg/ml ammonium ferric citrate, and 100 μm Na2S, and the cells were cultivated at 37 °C until A600 nm reached 0.5. Then the medium was further shaken at 25 °C for 2 h. Isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added at a final concentration of 0.5 mm to induce expression, and the cells were grown at 20 °C for 16 h. The cells were harvested by centrifugation in a GSA rotor at 6,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. The cell pellets were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C until use. Purification procedures were basically the same as in the previous study (23Yano T. Sled' V.D. Ohnishi T. Yagi T. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 494-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). E. coli cells were suspended in 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.4) containing 0.3 m NaCl, 0.1 mmphenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, and 1.0 mm DTT and disrupted by two times freeze-thawing followed by a sonication with a Brownson sonifier attached to a narrow tip at an amplitude of 5 with 50% pulse mode for 3 min. After centrifugation at 6,000 rpm for 10 min in a Sorvall GSA rotor to remove unbroken cells, the supernatant was ultracentrifuged at 50,000 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C in Beckman Spinco 60Ti rotor. The supernatant was degassed in vacuo and purged with argon (this cycle was repeated at least three times) and then brought into an anaerobic chamber. The following procedures were performed under anaerobic conditions (oxygen <1 ppm). Ni-NTA agarose resin was prepared in a small column (1.5 × 10 cm) and equilibrated with 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.4) containing 0.5 m NaCl, 0.1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, and 0.5 mm DTT. The supernatant was applied onto the column. The resin was washed with 10 bed volumes of the equilibration buffer followed by 10 volumes of the same buffer containing 80 mm imidazole. The bound proteins were eluted with the buffer containing 400 mm imidazole. The protein fractions were pooled and dialyzed against 1 liter of degassed 50 mm HEPES buffer (pH 8.0) containing 1.0 mm DTT for 16 h at 4 °C. The dialyzed proteins were concentrated with Microcon-10 to an appropriate concentration. The purified soluble NQO9 subunits were dialyzed against 50 mm HEPES buffer (pH 8.0) containing 1.0 mm DTT. The protein solution was diluted to 10 μm with the same buffer and repeatedly degassed and purged with oxygen-free argon gas and then brought into an anaerobic chamber (oxygen level <1 ppm). All solutions were degassed and purged with oxygen-free argon and equilibrated in the chamber at least overnight. The following procedures were carried out in the anaerobic chamber at room temperature. β-Mercaptoethanol was added to the protein solution at 1.0% (v/v), and the solution was gently stirred for 90 min to reduce cysteine residues. Fifty mmFeCl3 and 50 mm Na2S solutions were added in a dropwise manner, respectively, to be at final concentrations of 500 and 750 μm. The reconstitution was proceeded by stirring for 60 min. The solution was diluted with 9 volumes of 50 mm HEPES buffer (pH 8.0), and the solution was applied onto a Ni-NTA column (1.0 × 3 cm) equilibrated with the same buffer. The column was washed with 10 bed volumes of 50 mm HEPES buffer containing 0.5 mm DTT, and the absorbed proteins were eluted with 50 mm HEPES buffer (pH 8.0) containing 0.5 mm DTT and 400 mm imidazole. The greenish-black reconstituted subunits were pooled and dialyzed against 100 volumes of 50 mm HEPES buffer (pH 8.0) containing 1.0 mmDTT overnight. If necessary, the proteins were concentrated with Microcon-10 to an appropriate concentration and used for characterization. The expressed non-fused NQO9 subunit purified from inclusion bodies was used for raising the antibody according to Ref.28Takano S. Yano T. Yagi T. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 9120-9127Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar. In order to confirm the identity of the expressed NQO9 subunit, the expressed subunit was subjected to amino acid analysis and gas-phase amino acid sequencing beforehand. The amino acid composition of the expressed NQO9 subunit corresponds reasonably well to that deduced from the nqo9 gene (data not shown). The N-terminal partial amino acid sequence of the expressed NQO9 subunit was AFDFA, indicating that the methionine residue of the NQO9 subunit had been cleaved off by post-translational processing. Similar post-translational processing was observed in the mature NQO3, NQO4, NQO5, and NQO6 subunits (26Yano T. Yagi T. Sled' V.D. Ohnishi T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18264-18270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar,28Takano S. Yano T. Yagi T. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 9120-9127Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The sequence perfectly matches the deduced primary structure of the NQO9 subunit. Therefore, we concluded that the NQO9 subunit was correctly expressed in E. coli. The subunit-specific antibodies raised against the NQO9 subunit, when tested against theP. denitrificans membranes, reacted with a single band that migrated in the SDS-polyacrylamide gel with the apparent molecular mass of 20 kDa. The apparent molecular size of the band reacted by the anti-NQO9 antibodies is consistent with the relative molecular mass of the overexpressed subunit. Affinity purification of the subunit-specific antibodies and Western blotting were performed according to Refs. 36Han A.-L. Yagi T. Hatefi Y. Arch. Biochem.

Final detection was performed with an ECL detection kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's protocol. P. denitrificans membrane fraction was prepared from cells grown on glucose by the lysozyme-osmosis method (39Yagi T. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1986; 250: 302-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The membranes were sonicated on ice with Brownson sonifier attached to a narrow tip at amplitude of 5 with 50% pulse mode for 3 min.

GCG software programs were used to analyze the amino acid sequence (40Devereux J. Haeberli P. Smithies O. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 387-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (11514) Google Scholar). Sequence comparison of the polypeptides was conducted with the BESTFIT and PILEUP programs. The FASTA and PROFILESEARCH programs were used to search the GenBankTM/EMBL sequence data bases for proteins having some homology to the polypeptides. Homology search was also carried out using the BLAST program running at the National Center for Biotechnology Information. UV-visible absorption spectra were recorded on an SLM-Aminco DW-2000 spectrophotometer at room temperature. Protein was estimated by the method of Lowry et al. (41Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in the presence of 1 mg/ml potassium deoxycholate (42Bensadoun A. Weinstein D. Anal.

https://openalex.org/W2016136969,"Mammalian Ubc9 (mUbc9) is required for rapid degradation of the E2A proteins E12 and E47 by the ubiquitin-proteasome system. We have shown elsewhere that mUbc9 interacts with amino acids 477–530 of E12/E47. Here we test the hypothesis that this region, rich in proline, glutamic acid, serine, and threonine (PEST) residues, serves as the E2A protein degradation domain (DD). An E2A protein lacking this region, E47Δ(478–531), was significantly more stable than wild-type E47(half-life of more than 6 h versus55 min). Deletion of the E2A DD had no effect on the E-box-binding and transcriptional activity of E47. We mapped two discreet mUbc9-interacting regions within the E2A DD: amino acids 476–494 and 505–513. E2A(505–513) interacted with mUbc9 but not with human Ubc5, MyoD, Id3, or the polymyositis-scleroderma autoantigen. Substitution of the E2A(505–513) central hydrophobic residues with basic residues abolished interaction with mUbc9. Also, full-length E47 lacking the second mUbc9-interacting region was significantly more stable than wild-type E47. Reintroduction of the E2A DD into the long-lived, naturally occurring chimeric oncoprotein E2A-HLF (hepatic leukemic factor) destabilized it, suggesting that this domain can transfer a degradation signal to a heterologous protein. E2A-HLF-DD chimeric protein was stabilized by the proteasome inhibitor LLNL, indicating the role of the ubiquitin-proteasome system mediating degradation through the E2A degradation domain. Our experiments indicate that the E2A DD mediates E2A protein interactions with the ubiquitin-proteasome system and that the E2A DD is required for metabolism of these widely expressed proteins. Mammalian Ubc9 (mUbc9) is required for rapid degradation of the E2A proteins E12 and E47 by the ubiquitin-proteasome system. We have shown elsewhere that mUbc9 interacts with amino acids 477–530 of E12/E47. Here we test the hypothesis that this region, rich in proline, glutamic acid, serine, and threonine (PEST) residues, serves as the E2A protein degradation domain (DD). An E2A protein lacking this region, E47Δ(478–531), was significantly more stable than wild-type E47(half-life of more than 6 h versus55 min). Deletion of the E2A DD had no effect on the E-box-binding and transcriptional activity of E47. We mapped two discreet mUbc9-interacting regions within the E2A DD: amino acids 476–494 and 505–513. E2A(505–513) interacted with mUbc9 but not with human Ubc5, MyoD, Id3, or the polymyositis-scleroderma autoantigen. Substitution of the E2A(505–513) central hydrophobic residues with basic residues abolished interaction with mUbc9. Also, full-length E47 lacking the second mUbc9-interacting region was significantly more stable than wild-type E47. Reintroduction of the E2A DD into the long-lived, naturally occurring chimeric oncoprotein E2A-HLF (hepatic leukemic factor) destabilized it, suggesting that this domain can transfer a degradation signal to a heterologous protein. E2A-HLF-DD chimeric protein was stabilized by the proteasome inhibitor LLNL, indicating the role of the ubiquitin-proteasome system mediating degradation through the E2A degradation domain. Our experiments indicate that the E2A DD mediates E2A protein interactions with the ubiquitin-proteasome system and that the E2A DD is required for metabolism of these widely expressed proteins.

Because the transmembrane receptor Notch inhibits full-length E47 by a mechanism independent of its bHLH and TADs, there may be additional E2A regulatory domains or cofactors (16Ordentlich P. Lin A.

Degradation of the E2A proteins through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway represents another important mechanism of post-translational regulation. Consistent with this mechanism, we found that the E2A proteins are highly unstable, with a half-life of 55 min (17Kho C.-J. Huggins G.S. Endege W.O. Hsieh C.-M. Lee M.-E. Haber E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3845-3851Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The three-part mechanism of targeting a protein for degradation begins with the formation of a ubiquitin conjugate with a ubiquitin-activating enzyme (also called E1) (18Haas A.L. Siepmann T.J. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 1257-1268Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Ubiquitin is then transferred to a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (also called E2), which transfers ubiquitin to an ε-amino group of a lysine residue on a substrate protein (with the assistance of a ubiquitin ligase). There are 12 families of ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes, which in combination with numerous ubiquitin ligases are responsible for all ubiquitin conjugation (18Haas A.L. Siepmann T.J. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 1257-1268Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). After the initial ubiquitin conjugate is made, a multi-ubiquitin appendage is produced that serves as a signal for substrate proteolysis by the 26 S proteasome. Beyond the requirement of the 26 S proteasome for E2A protein degradation (17Kho C.-J. Huggins G.S. Endege W.O. Hsieh C.-M. Lee M.-E. Haber E. J. Biol.

The mammalian (m) homologue of Saccharomyces cerevisiaeUbc9p (previously called UbcE2A and now referred to as mUbc9) was cloned by us (17Kho C.-J. Huggins G.S. Endege W.O. Hsieh C.-M. Lee M.-E.

Ubc9p is a nuclear protein required for cell viability in yeast. A deficiency in Ubc9p is associated with an arrest of the yeast cell cycle at the G2-M phase and an increase in the stability of the B (20Seufert W. Futcher B. Jentsch S.

We have demonstrated elsewhere that overexpression of a full-length mUbc9 antisense construct is associated with reduced degradation of E12 (17Kho C.-J. Huggins G.S. Endege W.O. Hsieh C.-M. Lee M.-E. Haber E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3845-3851Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). To elucidate the function of the mUbc9-E2A interaction, we mapped the E2A protein degradation domain and determined its relation to mUbc9. We previously mapped the mUbc9 binding site to a unique 54-amino acid region upstream of the bHLH domain common to E12 and E47(17). Here we demonstrate that a minimal mUbc9 binding site within this region is required for normal E2A protein turnover. Human E47 fragments and E47 deletion mutants were cloned into the eukaryotic expression plasmid pCR3 (Invitrogen, San Diego CA) with a six-histidine epitope tag. Using custom-designed oligonucleotide primers, we produced constructs encoding E47Δ(478–531) and E47Δ(505–513) by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). PCR products encoding E47 fragments or E47 mutants were cloned in-frame with the LexA gene into the EcoRI restriction site of the pEG202 yeast expression plasmid. The pJG4–5 galactose-inducible yeast plasmid was used to express TAD hybrid proteins of full-length mUbc9, human (h) Ubc5, MyoD, Id3, and rat (r) polymyositis-scleroderma autoantigen (rPM-Scl) in yeast. pRC-E2A-HLF (hepatic leukemic factor) was kindly provided by T.

Using sense (gaatccggAGTCGGCCTCCCGACTCCTACAG) and antisense (cttccggatGTACTGCTGGTCCGGGCCCG) primers with flanking BseAI restriction sites (lowercase), we amplified E47(477–531) by PCR, digested it with BseAI (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), and cloned it into an internal BseAI site in pRC-E2A-HLF to produce the pRC-E2A-HLF-DD construct. E2A-HLF-Control was produced using sense (gaatccggACGGACGAGGTGCTGTCCCTGGAG) and antisense (gaatccggaGCTTTGTCCGACTTGAGGTGCAT) primers that amplify the coding region for E47(531–581), which lies outside the destruction domain. All constructs were sequenced with the Thermosequenase Kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). NIH 3T3 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone, Logan UT), l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin in a humidified atmosphere at 37 °C with 5% CO2. Calcium phosphate precipitates and 15 μg of plasmid DNA were incubated with NIH 3T3 cells for 6 h. The next day the cells were cultured in methionine-free medium for 1 h, pulsed with medium supplemented with 0.3 mCi/ml [35S]methionine cell labeling mix (NEN Life Science Products) for 1 h and then chased with medium containing cold methionine. The cells were lysed in RIPA buffer (phosphate-buffered saline, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, and Complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals)). Clarified cellular extract (200 μg) was incubated with 2.5 μg of anti-E47 antibody (Pharmingen, San Diego, CA) or anti-E2A antibody (Pharmingen) for 90 min before the immune complexes were precipitated with a mixture of protein G-Sepharose (Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA) and protein A-Sepharose (Sigma). Immunoprecipitates were dephosphorylated with 5 units of calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase (New England Biolabs, Beverly MA) in 10 mm Tris Cl, pH 8.2, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 μg/μl aprotinin (incubated at 50 °C for 1 h). The proteins were eluted with sample buffer, subjected to 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and blotted onto nitrocellulose. The nitrocellulose membrane was then probed with anti-E47 antibody or anti-E2A antibody followed by anti-mouse IgG-HRP. The chemiluminescent image was developed on Kodak BioMax MR film. The relative amount of E47 immunoprecipitated by Western blotting was estimated by using the NIH Image software program. The nitrocellulose membrane was then exposed to a phosphor screen (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA) to measure the E47 radioactive signal. To correct for differences in loading, each E47 signal measured by the PhosphorImager was normalized against a measurement of total E47 protein by Western blotting. The proteasome was inhibited by culturing transfected cells in medium containing 20 μm N-acetyl-Leu-Leu-norleucinal (LLNL) (Sigma). Recombinant E47 and E47Δ(478–531) were expressed and labeled with [35S]methionine (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) by using the TnT T7 Coupled Reticulocyte System (Promega, Madison WI). E47 and E47Δ(478–531) have the same number of methionine residues. An equivalent amount of translation product, as measured by equal amounts of incorporated [35S]methionine, was incubated with a32P end-labeled E-box oligonucleotide (30Weintraub H. Davis R. Lockshon D. Lassar A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The samples were run on a 5% polyacrylamide gel; the gel was dried and then exposed overnight to Kodak BioMax MR film. EGY48 (MAT αtrp1 ura3 his3 LEU2:: pLexop6-LEU2) was used as host strain with the pSH18–34 β-galactosidase reporter plasmid. Individual colonies were picked and grown in 2% glucose liquid medium lacking uracil, histidine, and tryptophan until the A600 ranged from 0.5 to 1.0. The cells were washed and grown overnight in 2% galactose and 1% raffinose liquid medium lacking uracil, histidine, and tryptophan. The crude extracts were then tested for β-galactosidase activity in a liquid assay with theo-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (Sigma) substrate, as described (17Kho C.-J. Huggins G.S. Endege W.O. Hsieh C.-M. Lee M.-E. Haber E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3845-3851Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Expression of bait plasmids was confirmed by Western blotting with an anti-LexA antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz CA). The mean and standard error of the mean was determined for replicate samples. Differences were determined by factorial analysis of variance with the Statview program. Ap value of less than 0.05 was considered significant. mUbc9 interacts with the E2A proteins in a region conserved in E12 and E47(amino acids 477–530, just upstream of the bHLH domain) (17Kho C.-J. Huggins G.S. Endege W.O. Hsieh C.-M. Lee M.-E. Haber E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3845-3851Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). To test our hypothesis that this region (Fig.1 A) is the E2A degradation domain, we constructed the plasmid E47Δ(478–531), which encodes an E47 mutant lacking this region. After transiently transfecting the E47Δ(478–531) plasmid and an E47 plasmid into NIH 3T3 fibroblasts, we compared the degradation of the two proteins in a pulse-chase experiment. We chose a 2-h chase to evaluate the effect of E47 mutation on degradation because about 25% of the wild-type E47 remains after that time. E47Δ(478–531) was more stable than wild-type E47, with a half-life longer than 2 h (Fig. 1 B). Significantly less wild-type E47 remained in comparison with E47Δ(478–531) (Fig.1 C; 26.1%±13.5, mean ± S.E., versus78.1%±5.7, p < 0.0001). We noted a slight but reproducible decrease in the electrophoretic mobility of E47Δ(478–531) after 2 h of chase, consistent with post-translational modification of the protein (Figs.1 B and 2 A). Because the E2A proteins have numerous potential serine/threonine phosphorylation sites, we speculated that phosphorylation was responsible for the change in E47Δ(478–531) mobility. Treatment of the E47Δ(478–531) immunoprecipitate with calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase increased E47Δ(478–531) mobility and collapsed a smear of multiple bands to a single band (Fig. 2 A) that migrated at a molecular mass similar to that of in vitro transcribed and translated E47Δ(478–531) (data not shown). These results indicate that removal of the mUbc9-interacting domain results in a more stable E47 protein, which is subject to hyperphosphorylation. To determine whether deletion of the E2A degradation domain affected E47 binding to DNA, we tested the ability of E47Δ(478–531) to bind to an E-box probe in an electrophoretic mobility shift assay. The protein-DNA complex formed by the mutant E2A migrated slightly faster, consistent with the reduced size of the mutant protein. Equal amounts of in vitro transcribed and translated E47 and E47Δ(478–531) retained similar amounts of an E-box probe (Fig.2 B, bracket). Therefore, homodimer formation and DNA binding through the HLH domain and the basic region, respectively, were unaffected by removal of the adjacent degradation domain. In addition, E47Δ(478–531) activated transcription of an E-box reporter plasmid in NIH 3T3 cells (data not shown), indicating that the function of the TADs had been preserved. Thus, mUbc9 appears to interact with an E2A domain that is functionally separable from the previously described bHLH domain and TADs. The E2A degradation domain is highly conserved across species (Fig. 3 A). Almost the entire coding region for E2A(478–531) is contained on a single exon upstream of the alternatively spliced bHLH E12 and E47 exons (exon J of the E2A gene, as described by Sun and Baltimore (31Sun X.-H. Baltimore D. Cell. 1991; 64: 459-470Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar)). The primary amino acid sequence of E2A(478–531) is rich in PEST (proline, glutamic acid, serine, and threonine) residues common to degradation domains (32Huang L.E. Gu J. Schau M. Bunn H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7987-7992Crossref PubMed Scopus (1849) Google Scholar). We used a panel of deletion mutants to more closely map the degradation domain regions necessary for E2A to interact with mUbc9. In a yeast two-hybrid system, E2A protein fragments fused to the DNA-binding domain of LexA were tested for their ability to interact with mUbc9 fused to a TAD. To measure interaction as a function of β-galactosidase production, we used a reporter plasmid encoding the β-galactosidase gene regulated by LexA. In comparison with LexA-E47(476–651), LexA-E2A(476–520) bound TAD-mUbc9 strongly but LexA-E2A(520–532) did not (Fig. 3 B). LexA-E2A(476–494) and LexA-E2A(505–513) interacted strongly with TAD-mUbc9, yet there was no interaction with the intervening region, LexA-E2A(494–504). Hybrid protein LexA-E2A(510–520), which includes a casein kinase II phosphorylation site (14Johnson S.E. Wang X. Hardy S. Taparowsky E.J. Konieczny S.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1604-1613Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 15Sloan S.R. Shen C.-P. McCarrick-Walmsley R. Kadesch T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6900-6908Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), and hybrid protein LexA-E2A(520–532), which includes a cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase site (15Sloan S.R. Shen C.-P. McCarrick-Walmsley R. Kadesch T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6900-6908Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), showed no significant interaction with TAD-mUbc9. These results indicate that mUbc9 interacts with two distinct, nearby regions of the E2A proteins: E2A(476–494) and E2A(505–513). The primary amino acid sequence of E2A(476–494) is rich in nonaromatic hydrophobic and hydroxyl side chains, whereas that of E2A(505–513) has a central threonine-serine pair flanked by glutamic and aspartic acid residues (Fig. 3 A). We focused on E2A(505–513) because it is smaller than E2A(476–494) and more highly conserved. LexA-E2A(505–513) interacted specifically with the mUbc9 portion of TAD-mUbc9 as shown by an approximately 20-fold increase in β-galactosidase activity above that of TAD alone (p< 0.001). Although hUbc5 and mUbc9 are similar in size and structure, the β-galactosidase production of LexA-E2A(505–513) with TAD-hUbc5 was not significantly different from that with TAD alone (Fig.4). Nor did LexA-E2A(505–513) interact with other known E2A-interacting HLH proteins, including Id3 and MyoD (Fig. 4). Elsewhere we described an interaction between rPM-Scl and E2A(477–530) (33Kho C.-J. Huggins G.S. Endege W.O. Patterson C. Jain M.K. Lee M.-E. Haber E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13426-13431Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Because rPM-Scl did not interact with LexA-E2A(505–513), the domain that interacts with rPM-Scl must fall outside the E2A(505–513) region. We determined the importance to mUbc9 binding of the central hydrophobic residues of E2A(505–513) by introducing multiple mutations into the coding region of pEG-E2A(505–513). A point and frameshift mutation produced pEG-E2A-mut, which encoded LexA-EETRKRLTI instead of LexA-EENTSADH. LexA-E2A-mut did not interact with TAD-mUbc9 (Fig.5). We also introduced point mutations into the E2A(505–513) coding sequence to determine the effect of individual charge interactions on the interaction with mUbc9. The interaction of TAD-mUbc9 and lysine mutant LexA-E2A-E504K or LexA-E2A-E505K reduced β-galactosidase production slightly (data not shown). Mutation of E2A Ser509, which is conserved from zebra fish to humans, to an aspartic acid residue (S509D) increased β-galactosidase production (p < 0.05), whereas an alanine mutation (S509A) had no effect (Fig. 5). In contrast, a lysine mutation (S509K) reduced β-galactosidase production. These results indicate that singular mutations within the second mUbc9-interacting region influence the interaction of mUbc9 with the whole E2A protein but only to a limited degree. A complete interruption of the binding interaction between E2A(505–513) and mUbc9 requires numerous substitutions of hydrophobic residues with charged residues. To substantiate a role for mUbc9 in the degradation of the E2A proteins, we deleted E2A(505–513) from E47. E47Δ(505–513) is more selective than E47Δ(478–531) because it is not missing any potential ubiquitin acceptor sites. After a 2-h chase (Fig. 6 A), significantly more E47Δ(505–513) remained than wild-type E47(mean ± S.E.: 61.8 ± 5.6% versus 27 ± 9.4%,p = 0.03). The half-life of E47Δ(505–513) was 3 h (Fig. 6 B), which is more than wild-type E47(half-life 1 h) and less than E47Δ(478–531) (half-life, >6 h). The chromosomal translocation t(17;19)(q22;p13) produces a chimeric oncoprotein composed of the E2A TADs and the basic leucine zipper region of HLF (28Yoshihara T. Inaba T. Shapiro L.H. Kato J.-Y. Look A.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3247-3255Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 29Inaba T. Roberts W.M. Shapiro L.H. Jolly K.W. Raimondi S.C. Smith S.D. Look A.T. Science. 1992; 257: 531-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar) (Fig.7 A). E2A-HLF and other E2A chimeric oncoproteins have potent transforming capabilities, and they are responsible for 25% of pre-B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemias. Because we noted that all E2A oncoproteins contain a translocation site that omits the exon encoding the degradation domain, we hypothesized that E2A-HLF is a stable protein because it lacks the degradation domain and that inclusion of this domain would destabilize E2A-HLF. We cloned a PCR-amplified DNA fragment encoding E2A(477–531) in-frame into a unique restriction site between the two E2A TADs of E2A-HLF (Fig. 7 A) to make E2A-HLF-DD. To control for the effect of insertion on degradation of the chimeric protein, the adjacent region encoding E47(531–581) was also cloned into E2A-HLF to produce E2A-HLF-Control. By pulse-chase analysis, we found that E2A-HLF was a stable protein with a half-life in excess of 2 h; E2A-HLF-DD, however, had a half-life of 60 min, similar to that of the E2A proteins (Fig. 7 B). After a 2-h chase, significantly more E2A-HLF remained than E2A-HLF-DD (71.0 ± 9.2% versus13.9 ± 3.6%, p < 0.001), whereas E2A-HLF-Control was stable (74.4 ± 8.5% remaining) (Fig.7 C). Previously we have demonstrated that degradation of the E2A proteins is reduced by treatment with a proteasome inhibitor. To analyze the mechanism of degradation of the E2A-HLF-DD protein, transfected cells were treated with the proteasome inhibitor LLNL. E2A-HLF-DD was more abundant following treatment with LLNL compared with E2A-HLF (Fig.8), indicating that the degradation of E2A-HLF-DD is dependent upon the proteasome. We have demonstrated previously that the E2A proteins are degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome system and that they interact with mUbc9 (17Kho C.-J. Huggins G.S. Endege W.O. Hsieh C.-M. Lee M.-E. Haber E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3845-3851Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In the present study we show that removal of the mUbc9 interacting region markedly stabilizes E47. Despite the deletion, E47Δ(478–531) retains the ability to form homodimers that bind to the E-box sequence and activate E-box-dependent transcription. The transcription factor c-Jun also has a degradation domain that is separable from its DNA-binding domain and TADs; the absence of the c-Jun δ-domain, as occurs naturally in v-Jun, results in a more stable protein with intact DNA binding and transcription activation properties (34Treier M. Staszewski L.M. Bohmann D. Cell. 1994; 78: 787-798Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar). Domains rich in PEST residues, such as the E2A degradation domain, often serve as phosphoacceptor sites on short-lived proteins (32Huang L.E. Gu J. Schau M. Bunn H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7987-7992Crossref PubMed Scopus (1849) Google Scholar). Cdc28 kinase phosphorylation of the Cln3 PEST-rich degradation domain decreases the half-life of Cln3 (35Yaglom J. Linskens M.H.K. Sadis S. Rubin D.M. Futcher B. Finley D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 731-741Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and phosphorylation of the PEST-rich cytoplasmic domain of yeast uracil permease accelerates its degradation (36Marchal C. Haguenauer-Tsapis R. Urban-Grimal D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 314-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation regulates the degradation of many mammalian proteins, including cyclin D (37Diehl J.A. Zindy F. Sherr C.J. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 957-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar), IκBα (38Chen Z.J. Parent L. Maniatis T. Cell. 1996; 84: 853-862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (870) Google Scholar), and c-Jun (39Musti A.M. Treier M. Bohmann D. Science. 1997; 275: 400-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). The E2A proteins have numerous potential phosphorylation sites, and deletion of the E2A degradation domain allows multiphosphorylated E47 species to accumulate. Perhaps the hyperphosphorylation of E47Δ(478–531) (Fig. 2) reflects phosphorylation events designed to initiate E2A protein degradation. Although the relative stability of E47Δ(505–513) (Fig. 6) and the conservation of Ser509within the PEST-rich E2A degradation domain (Fig. 3 A) suggest a link between Ser509 phosphorylation and degradation, we found that a full-length E47 protein with a lysine residue substituted for Ser509 (E47-S509K) had the same half-life as wild-type E47 (data not shown). We have demonstrated that mUbc9 interacts with the E2A degradation domain (Fig. 1) and that the second mUbc9-interacting region is required for normal E47 degradation (Fig. 6). This association of mUbc9 with E2A degradation is supported by our previous work, which showed that inhibition of mUbc9 expression by full-length antisense overexpression was associated with reduced E12 degradation (17Kho C.-J. Huggins G.S. Endege W.O. Hsieh C.-M. Lee M.-E. Haber E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3845-3851Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Our present and former studies stand in contrast to recent work showing that Ubc9 probably forms conjugates with ubiquitin-like proteins (such as yeast Smt3 and mammalian SUMO-1) that are not associated with degradation (40Johnson E.S. Schwienhorst I. Dohmen R.J. Blobel G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5509-5519Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar, 41Johnson E.S. Blobel G. J. Biol.

A. 1998; 95: 560-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Ubc9-mediated conjugation of SUMO-1 to RanGAP1 was associated with RanGAP1 nuclear pore localization (45Mahajan R. Delphin C. Guan T. Gerace L. Melchior F. Cell. 1997; 88: 97-107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1006) Google Scholar), an event separate from degradation, and Ubc9-mediated SUMO-1 conjugation to IκBα was associated with a reduction in degradation (46Desterro J.M.P. Rodriguez M.S. Hay R.T. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 233-239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (914) Google Scholar). We have not found an E2A-SUMO-1 conjugate in NIH-3T3 cells (data not shown), yet E2A protein isolated from mouse thymus does exist in a 66-kDa form, which is the size of the native protein, and an 85-kDa form, which may be an E2A-SUMO-1 conjugate (7Zhuang Y. Barndt R.J. Pan L. Kelley R. Dai M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3340-3349Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). There are at least three possible explanations for the paradox posed by our results. First, the conventional ubiquitin conjugating system may recognize the same peptide motifs of the E2A proteins as mUbc9. For example, mUbc9 uses the same domain in IκBα for SUMO-1 conjugation that other ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes use for ubiquitin conjugation (46Desterro J.M.P. Rodriguez M.S. Hay R.T. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 233-239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (914) Google Scholar). Although our work suggests at least an indirect association between mUbc9 and degradation, we cannot exclude the possibility that deleting the second mUbc9-interacting region disrupted binding sites for conventional ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes that target E2A proteins for degradation. Second, interaction of mUbc9 with the E2A proteins may be a necessary intermediary step prior to their degradation. This explanation is supported by our observation that both our antisense underexpression studies (17Kho C.-J. Huggins G.S. Endege W.O. Hsieh C.-M. Lee M.-E. Haber E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3845-3851Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) and deletion experiments shown in this report both demonstrated reduced degradation. Finally, mUbc9 may target the E2A proteins directly for degradation; yet considering that mUbc9 cannot conjugate ubiquitin and that ubiquitin is the preferred signal for the proteasome to initiate degradation, this option is unlikely. Future work will center on identifying additional components of the ubiquitin conjugating system that interact with the E2A degradation domain. We searched for a consensus sequence within the E2A degradation domain that could be used by conventional ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes. The second mUbc9-interacting region resembles a class II degradation signal (47Sadis S. Atienza C. Finley D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4086-4094Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), which typically features a hydrophobic center flanked by charged residues. Ubc4/5 and Ubc6/7 both target proteins for degradation through a class II degradation signal; however, the E2A degradation domain lacks the amino acid sequence SWNFKLYVM, which resembles a proposed degradation signal for these enzymes. We did not find an interaction between the second mUbc9-interacting region and hUbc5, which is similar to mUbc9 in size but structurally distinct from it (48Tong H. Hateboer G. Perrakis A. Bernards R. Sixma T.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21381-21387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). An alternate Ubc6/7 degradation signal has been proposed, F(T/S)(T/S)L, that features a central pair of serine or threonine residues (49Gilon T. Chomsky O. Kulka R.G. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2759-2766Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). The second mUbc9-interacting region, EENTSAADH, resembles this sequence, even though the mUbc9-binding site is not flanked by bulky hydrophobic residues. The biological importance of the E2A degradation domain is underscored by our observation that every translocation that produces a chimeric E2A-oncoprotein excludes the exon that encodes the degradation domain. The prolonged half-life of E2A-HLF (Fig. 7), like that of v-Jun (34Treier M. Staszewski L.M. Bohmann D. Cell. 1994; 78: 787-798Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar), probably potentiates its transforming capabilities by allowing more protein to accumulate and activate transcription or sequester an important interacting partner (52Honda H. Inaba T. Suzuki T. Oda H. Ebihara Y. Tsuiji K. Nakahata T. Ishikawa T. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. Blood. 1999; 93: 2780-2790Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The long half-life of a stable protein can be shortened by the addition of a degradation domain (35Yaglom J. Linskens M.H.K. Sadis S. Rubin D.M. Futcher B. Finley D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 731-741Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,50Hochstrasser M. Varshavsky A. Cell. 1990; 61: 697-708Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 51Kornitzer D. Raboy B. Kulka R.G. Fink G.R. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 6021-6030Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). When we added an E2A degradation domain to E2A-HLF, the new protein was degraded more quickly than was E2A-HLF (half-life of 60 minversus more than 2 h, Fig. 7). By comparison, addition of the 51-amino acid region of E47 adjacent to the degradation domain did not destabilize E2A-HLF. Finally, E2A-HLF-DD was stabilized by a proteasome inhibitor, demonstrating that the E2A-DD targets protein for degradation through the proteasome. Our findings that removal of E2A(478–531) produces a stable E47 protein and that inclusion of E2A(477–531) produces an unstable protein support the conclusion that this mUbc9-interacting domain is the E2A degradation domain.

https://openalex.org/W1990013893,"Abstract Pleckstrin homology (PH) domains are present in over one hundred signaling molecules, where they are thought to mediate membrane targeting by binding to phosphoinositides. They were initially defined at the NH2 and COOH termini of the molecule, pleckstrin, a major substrate for protein kinase C in platelets. We have previously reported that pleckstrin associates with the plasma membrane, where it induces the formation of villous and ruffled structures from the surface of transfected cells (1). We now show that overexpression of pleckstrin results in reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton. This pleckstrin effect is regulated by its phosphorylation and requires the NH2-terminal, but not the COOH-terminal, PH domain. Overexpression of the NH2-terminal PH domain alone of pleckstrin is sufficient to induce the cytoskeletal effects. Pleckstrin-induced actin rearrangements are not inhibited by pharmacologic inhibition of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, nor are they blocked by co-expression of a dominant negative phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. The cytoskeletal effects of pleckstrin can be blocked by co-expression of a dominant negative Rac1 variant, but not wild-type Rac and not a dominant negative Cdc42 variant. These data indicate that the NH2-terminal PH domain of pleckstrin induces reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton via a pathway dependent on Rac but independent of Cdc42 and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase."

Wild type and mutated dehydrogenase domains of yeast MFE-2 were overexpressed, purified, and characterized in vitro.

Biol. 1995; 5: 255-269Google Scholar) and selected on SD/Uracil plates. The HsMFE-2 insert in pUC18 was used as a template to generate a G16S mutation. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed according to the instructions of the QuikChangeTMsite-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The ScMFE-2insert in pUC18 was taken as a template for generating pUC18::ScMFE-2(aΔ) or pUC18::ScMFE-2(bΔ). The primers designed for generating the G16S mutation in Sc MFE-2(aΔ) were 5′-GTT GTA ATC ACG TCT GCT GGA GGG GG-3′ (5′-primer) and 5′-CC CCC TCC AGC AGA CGT GAT TAC AAC-3′ (3′-primer). Primers 5′-GTA GTA GTT ACG TCT GCA GGA GGT GGT C-3′ (5′-primer) and 5′-G ACC TCC TGC AGA CGT AAC TAC ATC-3′ (3′-primer) were used in generating the G329S mutation in Sc MFE-2(bΔ). pUC18::ScMFE- 2(aΔ) was used as a PCR template to obtain pUC18:: ScMFE-2(aΔbΔ)with the primers designed for mutation G329S. All of the mutated DNA inserts were cloned into pYE352 (11Filppula S.A. Sormunen R.T. Hartig A. Kunau W.-H. Hiltunen J.K. J. Biol.

The nucleotide sequences of all the mutated variants were verified. The region of cDNA encoding amino acid residues 1–612 of C. tropicalis peroxisomal MFE-2 was amplified from the plasmid pMK22/HDE50 (13Aitchison J.D. Rachubinski R.A. Curr. Genet. 1990; 17: 481-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) by PCR with Pfu polymerase, using 5′-primer 5′-catATG TCT CCA GTT GAT TTT AAA-3′ and 3′-primer 5′-ggatcctta TTC GTC TTC GTC ATC ATC A-3′ containing NdeI and BamHI, respectively. The resulting 1839-base pair PCR fragment was subcloned into pUC18. Following digestion by NdeI and BamHI, the fragment was cloned into the pET3a expression vector (Novagen, Inc., Madison, WI) yielding pET3a:: CtMFE-2(h2Δ), and the nucleotide sequence encoding the dehydrogenase domains was verified. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed in a similar way as for the pYE352-ScMFE-2 variants, using theCtMFE-2 specific primers. By using pET3a::CtMFE-2(h2Δ) as a PCR template, pET3a::CtMFE-2 (h2ΔaΔ) was generated with 5′-primer, 5′-GTG ATC ATT ACC AGT GCC GGT GGT G-3′ and 3′-primer, 5′-C ACC ACC GGC ACT GGT AAT GAT CAC-3′, and pET3a::CtMFE-2 (h2ΔbΔ) was generated with 5′-primer, 5′-GTT TTG ATC ACC AGT GCC GGT GCT GG-3′ and 3′-primer 5′-CC AGC ACC GGC ACT GGT GAT CAA AAC-3′. pET3a::CtMFE-2(h2ΔaΔbΔ) was generated with the primers designed for CtMFE-2(h2ΔbΔ)using pET3a::CtMFE-2(h2ΔaΔ) as a template. The pET3a::CtMFE-2(h2Δ) and its mutated variants were transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3) plysS cells. M9ZB medium supplemented with carbenicillin (50 μg/ml) and chloramphenicol (34 μg/ml) was used for expression experiments. 10 ml of an overnight culture of the E. colicells containing the plasmid pET3a::CtMFE-2(h2Δ)or its mutated variants were used to inoculate 1 liter of culture. The cells were allowed to grow at 37 °C under aerobic conditions until an A600 of 0.6 was reached. The expression of the recombinant protein was induced by addition of isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to a final concentration of 0.4 mm. After 2 h of induction at 33 °C, the cells were harvested and washed with phosphate-buffered saline (10 mm sodium phosphate, 2 mm potassium phosphate, 140 mm NaCl, 3 mm KCl, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, pH 7.4). The pellet was stored at −70 °C until use. Bacterial cell pellet (wet weight, 5.0 g) was suspended in 50 ml of 30 mm sodium phosphate, 90 mm NaCl, 1.0 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mmbenzamidine hydrochloride hydrate, and 0.5 mmdithiothreitol at pH 7.0 (buffer A). The bacteria were lysed by adding lysozyme (125 μg/ml), and the viscosity was reduced by adding DNase (25 μg/ml) and RNase (25 μg/ml) in the presence of 10 mm MgCl2 for 30 min at 30 °C. The insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 30,000 × gfor 45 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was applied to a 2.5 × 12.5 cm DEAE-Sephacel (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) column equilibrated with buffer A. The bound proteins were eluted with a 50-ml linear gradient of 0–0.3 m NaCl. The pooled DEAE-Sephacel fractions containing the (3R)-HADH activity were dialyzed against 20 mm Tris/HCl, 100 mm NaCl, pH 8.0 (buffer B) and applied to a 6-ml Resource Q column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with buffer B. The protein containing (3R)-HADH activity was eluted at 0.3 m NaCl. The pooled active fractions from the Resource Q column were concentrated and dialyzed against 20 mm MES, pH 6.1 (buffer C), and applied to a 1-ml Resource S column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with buffer C. The dehydrogenase was eluted with a 25-ml linear gradient of 0–0.2 m NaCl. Purification of the recombinant (3R)-HADH was completed after applying the protein to a Superdex 200 HR10/30 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with 200 mm potassium phosphate, 3 mm ethylene diaminetetraacetic acid, and 3 mmEGTA, pH 7.2. (3R)-Hydroxyacyl-CoA esters were synthesized by the mixed anhydride method (14Rasmussen J.T. Börchers T. Knudsen J. Biochem. J. 1991; 265: 849-855Crossref Scopus (161) Google Scholar) and purified by high pressure liquid chromatography on a reversed phase μBondapak™ C18 column (Waters, Milford, MA) applying a linear acetonitrile gradient. The assay buffer contained 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mm KCl, 1 μmol of NAD+ (Merck), 1 mm sodium pyruvate (Sigma), 2.5 mm MgCl2, 10 μg (21 units) of lactate dehydrogenase, and 30 nmol of (3R)-hydroxybutyryl-CoA in 0.5 ml. The dehydrogenase reaction was started by adding the sample and monitored by formation of the magnesium complex of 3-ketobutyryl-CoA at 303 nm at 22 °C. CD spectroscopy was carried out at 22 °C using a Jasco J710 spectropolarimeter. Adsorption at 280 nm was measured for all samples and used for fine adjustment of the protein concentration of the sample used for CD spectroscopy. The far-UV spectra of the proteins were measured from 200 to 250 nm in 80 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, with the following instrument settings: response, 1 s; sensitivity, 100 mdeg; speed, 50 nm/min; average of 30 scans. Kinetic constants for the (3R)-HADH activity were determined toward oxidation of (3R)-hydroxyacyl-CoA using formation of the Mg2+ complex of 3-ketoacyl-CoA as detected at 303 nm. The substrate concentrations for (3R)-hydroxybutyryl-CoA were 10, 30, 50, 80, 100, 150, and 200 μm, for (3R)-hydroxydecanoyl-CoA and those for (3R)-hydroxyhexadecanoyl-CoA were 2, 4, 8, 10, 30, and 50 μm. (3R)-Hydroxydecanoyl-CoA and (3R)-hydroxyhexadecanoyl-CoA were obtained by pre-incubatingtrans-2-decenoyl-CoA and trans-2-hexadecenoyl-CoA with recombinant 2-enoyl-CoA hydratase 2 (10Qin Y.-M. Haapalainen A.M. Conry D. Cuebas D.A. Hiltunen J.K. Novikov D.K. Biochem. J. 1997; 328: 377-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The equilibrium of the reaction is >90% on the side of the (3R)-hydroxy intermediate under the conditions used. 2Y.-M. Qin, unpublished observation. The measurement was performed in a final volume of 0.5 ml at 22 °C. Kinetic data were transformed to Lineweaver-Burk plots by using the GraFit computer software (Sigma). The Km values were calculated from the slopes of the curves, and the catalytic turnover numbers (kcat) were calculated by dividing the maximal velocities with the total amount of enzyme in the reaction. Protein concentrations were measured with Bio-Rad protein assay reagent, and protein samples were analyzed on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. The G16S variant of Hs MFE-2 has been shown to result in MFE-2 deficiency (6van Grunsven E.G. van Berkel E. Ijlst L. Vreken P. de Klerk J.B.C. Adamski J. Lemonde H. Clayton P.T. Cuebas D.A. Wanders R.J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2128-2133Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Because this glycine is in the nucleotide-binding site of the dehydrogenase domain and is conserved in MFE-2 of yeast, it is expected to be a functionally important amino acid residue in MFE-2 of lower eukaryotes (Fig.2). When pYE352::HsMFE-2 was introduced into S. cerevisiae fox-2 cells, the transformed strain regained the ability to grow on fatty acids as a carbon source as indicated by the clear zone formation on the oleic acid plate (Fig.3 A). However, no clear zones developed if the fox-2 cells transformed with pYE352::HsMFE-2(dhΔ), which encodes the G16S mutation (Fig. 3 A). When the enzyme activities of MFE-2 were measured from soluble extracts of transformed fox-2 cells, the hydratase 2 activity was observed in all cases, whereas the (3R)-HADH activity was abolished by the G16S mutation (TableI). The expression of the HsMFE-2 was also confirmed by immunoblotting of samples from these yeast extracts with antibody to rat 2-enoyl-CoA hydratase 2 (3Qin Y.-M. Pontanen M.H. Helander H.M.

The activities of (3R)-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase and 2-enoyl-CoA hydratase 2 have been measured from the yeast extract with 60 μm dl-3-hydroxydecanoyl-CoA as substrates as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The values (μmol × mg−1 × min−1) were means ± S.D. for three determinations.

The activities of (3R)-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase and 2-enoyl-CoA hydratase 2 have been measured from the yeast extract with 60 μm dl-3-hydroxydecanoyl-CoA as substrates as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The values (μmol × mg−1 × min−1) were means ± S.D. for three determinations. Enzyme activities below the detection limits (<0.002 μmol × mg−1 × min−1) are marked as ND (not detectable). Complementation indicated the formation of clear zones on oleic acid plates. Amino acid sequence alignment of nucleotide-binding sites revealed that Gly16 and Gly329 of Sc MFE-2 correspond to Gly16 of Hs MFE-2 (Fig. 2). The introduction of Gly → Ser mutations in Sc MFE-2 result in generation of variants Sc MFE-2(aΔ), ScMFE-2(bΔ), and Sc MFE-2(aΔbΔ). When the corresponding plasmids pYE352::ScMFE-2, pYE352::ScMFE-2(aΔ), pYE352:: ScMFE-2(bΔ), and pYE352::ScMFE-2(aΔbΔ) were transformed intofox-2 cells, each of the transformants grew on oleic acid plates and formed clear zones, except for those transformed with pYE352::ScMFE-2(aΔbΔ) (Fig.3 B). To investigate the kinetics of growth, the number of cells was monitored during growth in the liquid oleic acid media over time (Fig.3 C). The growth rates of S. cerevisiae fox-2cells transformed with either pYE352::ScMFE-2(aΔ) or pYE352:: ScMFE-2(bΔ) were about 50% of that found with pYE352:: ScMFE-2 transformed cells. In agreement with the plate assay, fox-2 or fox-2transformed with pYE352::ScMFE-2(aΔbΔ)did not show observable growth. To verify that S. cerevisiae MFE-2 and its variants were expressed, both 2-enoyl-CoA hydratase 2 and (3R)-HADH activities were measured in yeast cell homogenates (Table I). With the exception of the fox-2cells, hydratase 2 activity was detected for all transformants. When compared with Sc MFE-2(h2Δ), the dehydrogenase activity was decreased for the aΔ and bΔ variants, and it was completely lost for the aΔbΔ mutant. Our attempts to express and purifySc MFE-2(h2Δ) as a recombinant protein resulted in the enzyme undergoing inactivation within a few days. However, C. tropicalis MFE-2(h2Δ) yielded a protein stable for at least one year under the conditions stated under ”Experimental Procedures.“ Subsequent in vitro characterizations were carried out withC. tropicalis preparation. When pET3a::CtMFE-2(h2Δ) was expressed inE. coli BL 21plysS cells, (3R)-specific HADH activity was 23 μmol × min−1 × mg−1in the soluble cell extract when measured with (3R)-hydroxydecanoyl-CoA, whereas the activity was below the detection limit in the cells transformed with only the vector pET3a. The expressed Ct MFE-2(h2Δ) was purified to apparent homogeneity by using two anion exchange columns: DEAE-Sephacel and Resourse Q, followed by a cation exchange column, Resourse S, and a size exclusion Superdex 200/30 HR column (TableII). It is worth of noting that theCt MFE-2(h2Δ) preparation is, in fact, a monofunctional (3R)-HADH, which is an enzyme not commercially available and thus can potentially be used as a tool for investigating the metabolism of fatty acids and their derivatives. Ct MFE-2(h2ΔaΔ),Ct MFE-2(h2ΔbΔ), and Ct MFE-2(h2ΔaΔbΔ) were each expressed and purified following the same protocol, yielding apparent homogeneities (SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis; Fig. 4). In immunoblotting, the antibody to Ct MFE-2 (15de la Garza M.M. Schultz-Borchard U. Crabb J.W. Kunau W.-H. Eur J Biochem. 1985; 148: 285-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) recognizes these polypeptides of 66,000 Da, which agree with the molecular mass of 66,379 Da calculated from the amino acid sequence (data not shown). Native molecular masses of the proteins were determined to be 140 kDa by size exclusion chromatography (Superdex 200), indicating that they are dimers (Fig.4). CD spectra in the far-UV region (200–250 nm) were practically identical for both Ct MFE-2(h2Δ) and its variants (Fig.5).Table IIPurification of the yeast recombinant (3R)-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase [CiMFE-2(h2Δ)] from E. coliStepProteinTotal activitySpecific activityYieldPurificationmgμmol × min−1μmol × min−1 × mg−1 protein%foldSoluble extract1553250211001.0DEAE-Sephacel71300042922.0Resource Q27189070583.3Resource S101080108335.1Superdex 200 HR 0/30aAliquot from Resource S containing 18.4 μmol × min−1 (3R)-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase activity measured with (3R)-hydroxydecanoyl-CoA for Superdex 200 HR 10/30 chromatography.0.19231255.9The purification protocol is described under “Experimental Procedures.”a Aliquot from Resource S containing 18.4 μmol × min−1 (3R)-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase activity measured with (3R)-hydroxydecanoyl-CoA for Superdex 200 HR 10/30 chromatography.

The Ct MFE-2(h2Δ) showed the highest catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km) with the substrate (3R)-hydroxydecanoyl-CoA (C10). The Kmvalue was lowest for the C10 substrate, being approximately one-fifth and one-tenth of the value of the C16 and C4 substrates, respectively. Interestingly, the (3R)-HADH activity of CtMFE-2(h2Δ) broke into two different profiles when the mutated variants were analyzed (Table III). For Ct MFE-2(h2ΔaΔ), the catalytic constant (kcat) of C4 was the same as for Ct MFE-2(h2Δ) (29 ± 1 s−1 versus 31 ± 2 s−1), whereas that ofCt MFE-2(h2ΔbΔ) was below the detection limit, indicating that domain B is solely responsible for the utilization of C4 substrate. The kcat values of CtMFE-2(h2ΔaΔ) for C10 and C16 were 17 ± 1 s−1 and 12 ± 2 s−1. Interestingly, for CtMFE-2(h2ΔbΔ), the kcat values were 33 ± 2 s−1 and 36 ± 6 s−1, suggesting that domain A contributes more than domain B in the metabolism of medium and long chain substrates. The activity of CtMFE-2(h2ΔaΔbΔ) toward the substrates tested was below the detection limit of the assays used.Table IIIKinetic parameters of the wild type and mutated (3R)-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenases derived from MFE-2 from C. tropicalisSubstrateA+/B+ [CtMFE-2(h2Δ)]A−/B+ [CtMFE-2(h2ΔaΔ)]A−/B− [CtMFE-2(h2ΔbΔ)]A−/B− [CtMFE-2(h2Δa ΔbΔ)]kcatKmkcat/KmkcatKmkcat/KmkcatKmkcat/Kmkcats−1μmm−1s−1s−1μmm−1s−1s−1μmm−1s−1s−1(3R)-Hydroxybutyryl- CoA (C4)31 ± 255 ± 85.6 × 10529 ± 155 ± 105.3 × 105NDND(3R)-Hydroxydecanoyl- CoA (C10)53 ± 15.4 ± 19.8 × 10617 ± 15.8 ± 12.9 × 10633 ± 25.4 ± 16.1 × 106ND(3R)-Hydroxyhexadecanoyl-CoA (C16)41 ± 824 ± 11.7 × 10612 ± 225 ± 14.8 × 10536 ± 624 ± 51.5 × 106NDThe purified proteins were measured for (3R)-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase activities as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The values are the means ± S.D. for three determinations.

When no activity was observed, it was indicated as ND. The amino acid sequence of yeast peroxisomal MFE-2 reveals that the polypeptide contains two domains sharing 40% amino acid identity, both within the N-terminal half of the protein. The domains are about 300 amino acid residues long (Fig. 1), and each of the domains contains a binding site for NAD+ (Rossmann fold) close to their N termini. At about 120 amino acid residues from their C termini, the domains also contain the motif Tyr-Xaa-Xaa-Xaa-Lys. These features are characteristic of the members of the short chain alcohol dehydrogenase/reductase superfamily (8Jörnvall H. Persson B. Krook M. Atrian S. Gonzalez-Duarte R. Jeffery J. Ghosh D. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 6003-6013Crossref PubMed Scopus (1161) Google Scholar). A previous in vitroexperiment with a truncated version of S. cerevisiae MFE-2 (deletion of C-terminal 271 amino acid residues) indicated that the N-terminal domains were responsible for the (3R)-HADH activity in MFE-2 (2Hiltunen J.K. Wenzel B. Beyer A. Erdmann R. Fosså A. Kunau W.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6646-6653Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The present work, applying site-directed mutagenesis to dissect the putative nucleotide-binding sites of domains A and B, shows that the growth rates of fox-2 cells transformed with either pYE352::ScMFE-2(aΔ) or pYE352::ScMFE-2(bΔ) are slower than those cells transformed with pYE352:: ScMFE-2. This suggests that domains A and B are important for utilization of fatty acids as a carbon source. The fact that the activity of hydratase 2 was not changed in the yeast extracts when measured with the C10 substrate indicates that the growth rates were not due to differences in the levels of MFE-2 expression. The in vitro kinetic experiments with the purified recombinant yeast enzymes demonstrate that domain A is active toward medium and long chain (3R)-hydroxyacyl-CoA, whereas the B domain shows the highest catalytic rate with short chain (C4) substrates. CD far-UV spectroscopy revealed that the molar ellipticities of the proteins are similar, indicating that the mutations do not cause a change in the composition of secondary structure elements. These data, together with the observation thatCt MFE-2(h2Δ) and its variants are dimeric proteins, strongly argues that the observed differences in kinetics were due to the mutations affecting catalytic amino acid residues but not due to a change in overall folding itself. The estimated Kmvalues for domains A and B are between 5 and 50 μm,values that are within the same magnitude generally found for other β-oxidation enzymes (16Kiema T.R. Engel C.K. Schmitz W. Filppula S.A. Wierenga R.K. Hiltunen J.K. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 2991-2999Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). An interesting observation is that the sums of the kcat values for CtMFE-2(h2ΔaΔ) and Ct MFE-2(h2ΔbΔ) are very close tokcat determined for Ct MFE-2(h2Δ). According to the current literature, the physiological role of mammalian MFE-2 is to participate in metabolism of α-methyl-CoA esters (5Dieuaide-Noubhani M. Asselberghs S. Mannaerts G.P. Van Veldhoven P.P. Biochem. J. 1997; 325: 367-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). This is supported by the observation that α-methyl branched fatty acid intermediates accumulate in patients with MFE-2 deficiency (6van Grunsven E.G. van Berkel E. Ijlst L. Vreken P. de Klerk J.B.C. Adamski J. Lemonde H. Clayton P.T. Cuebas D.A. Wanders R.J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2128-2133Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 17Van Grunsven E.G. Van Berkel E.

However, an accumulation of straight very long chain fatty acids has also been reported in these patients (18Suzuki Y. Jiang L.L. Souri M. Miyazawa S. Fukuda S. Zhang Z. Une M. Shimozawa N. Kondo N. Orii T. Hashimoto T. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1997; 61: 1153-1162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). In addition, in vitro mammalian MFE-2 is capable of catalyzing the cleavage of straight chain (3R)-hydroxyacyl-CoAs (3Qin Y.-M. Pontanen M.H. Helander H.M. Kvist A.-P. Siivari K.M. Schmitz W.

In line with these findings, pYE352::HsMFE-2complements fox-2 cells allowing them to grow on oleic acid plates, suggesting that mammalian MFE-2 can also potentially participate in the β-oxidation of straight chain substrates in vivo . An acquisition of two domains within a single polypeptide with different chain length specificities is a novel strategy among lipid binding proteins to overcome the problems related to the metabolism of a large variety of substrates. Previously described strategies include gene duplication, which lead to the evolvement of separate enzymes, such as mammalian acyl-CoA dehydrogenases, which are presented as several paralogues (20Tanaka K. Matsubara Y. Indo Y. Naito E. Kraus J. Ozasa H. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1990; 321: 577-598Google Scholar). Adaptation can also occur via the development of adaptive substrate binding pocket, as is formed in both 2-enoyl-CoA hydratase 1 (crotonase) and the acyl-CoA binding protein. Mitochondrial hydratase 1, which catalyzes hydration reactions withtrans-2-enoyl-CoA substrates from C4 to C20 in chain length, has an active site pocket in each of the subunits that is large enough to bind crotonyl-CoA (21Engel C.K.

When a longer chain substrate is bound, the ω end of the acyl moiety clashes a flexible loop at the bottom of the pocket and the loop moves aside, resulting in the formation of tunnel traversing the whole subunit (22Engel C.K.

The acyl-CoA binding protein binds the acyl-CoA ester in a bent orientation anchoring the acyl chain in a hydrophobic cleft between two α-helices (23Rosendal J. Ertbjerg P. Knudsen J. Biochem. J. 1993; 290: 321-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The cleft in the bovine protein is large enough to engulf a carbon chain of up to C22 long. The data of the experiments of yeast growing in liquid medium indicate that both domains A and B are required for optimal growth of yeast cells on fatty acid as the sole carbon source. Yeast peroxisomal MFE-2 provides an intriguing example of one polypeptide that has acquired two enzymatically active dehydrogenase domains with different chain length specificities.

The use of subunit-specific antibodies together with membrane preparations is a reliable method for these purposes (22Matsuno-Yagi A. Hatefi Y. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 3508-3514Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 23Hekman C. Tomich J.M. Hatefi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13564-13571Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Previously the topological properties of the NQO4, -5, and -6 subunits of the P. denitrificans NDH-1 have been investigated (24Takano S. Yano T. Yagi T. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 9120-9127Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The NQO4, -5, and -6 subunits in membrane-bound P. denitrificans NDH-1 were extracted by treatment at alkaline pH or with chaotropes. In addition to antibodies specific to the NQO1–6 subunits (24Takano S. Yano T. Yagi T. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 9120-9127Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), the antibody directed to the NQO9 subunit is available in this laboratory as shown in the accompanying paper. Therefore, it is of interest to thoroughly investigate the localization of the 7 subunits, particularly that of the NQO9 subunit, in the P. denitrificans NDH-1 in situ. In the previous study (24Takano S. Yano T. Yagi T. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 9120-9127Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), the subunit stoichiometry of the NQO1–6 of the membrane-bound P. denitrificans NDH-1 has be determined to be 1 mol each per mol of the enzyme complex using radioimmunological techniques. However, there is no such information available regarding the NQO9 subunit and its homologues of other organisms. Therefore, it is of interest to elucidate the stoichiometry of the NQO9 subunit of the P. denitrificans NDH-1 because this subunit contains 2×[4Fe-4S] clusters. In this paper we describe subunit topology and the subunit stoichiometry of the P. denitrificans NDH-1. The NQO1–6 and 9 subunits have been extracted from the P. denitrificansmembranes by treatment at alkaline pH or with chaotropic agents, suggesting that these subunits are localized in the peripheral part of the P. denitrificans NDH-1 in situ. Meanwhile, we conducted the homologous expression of the NQO9 subunit of the P. denitrificans NDH-1. The N-terminal truncated and full-length NQO9 subunits were expressed, respectively, in the cytoplasm and in the cytoplasmic membrane of P. denitrificans. Based on these results the location of the NQO9 subunit as well as NQO6 subunit is discussed in this paper. In addition, subunit stoichiometry of the NQO1, -2, -4, and -9 have been determined by radioimmunoassay. The results show that there is one copy each of the NQO1–6 and -9 subunits in the P. denitrificans NDH-1. P. denitrificans membrane fraction was prepared from cells grown on glucose by lysozyme osmosis method (3Yagi T. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1986; 250: 302-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The membranes were sonicated on ice with a Brownson sonifier attached to a narrow tip at an amplitude of 5 with 50% pulse mode for 3 min. The cholate-treated P. denitrificans membranes were prepared according to Ref. 24Takano S. Yano T. Yagi T. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 9120-9127Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar. The individual subunits were expressed inE. coli according to Ref. 24Takano S. Yano T. Yagi T. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 9120-9127Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar. pET11a(NQO1), pET11a(NQO2), pET11a(NQO4), and pET11a(NQO9), which produce full-length forms of the corresponding subunits, were used to transform E. colistrain BL21(DE3). A single colony was picked up from the plate and inoculated into 30 ml of 2× YT medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin and was grown at 37 °C. WhenA600 reached 0.5, isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 0.5 mm, and the cells were cultivated at 37 °C for 4 h. The cells were harvested in a GSA rotor at 6,000 rpm for 10 min. Inclusion body fractions were prepared according to Ref. 24Takano S. Yano T. Yagi T. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 9120-9127Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar. The cells were suspended in 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0) containing 0.3m NaCl, 1.0 mm DTT, 1.0 mm EDTA, and 0.1 mm PMSF. The cell suspension was freeze-thawed twice with liquid nitrogen and twice with a 30 °C water bath. The resulting cell suspension was sonicated on ice with a Brownson sonifier attached to a narrow tip at an amplitude of 7 with 50% pulse mode for 10 min three times. The suspension was centrifuged, and the inclusion bodies were recovered. The inclusion bodies were washed with 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0) containing 10%(w/v) sucrose, 1.0 mm DTT, 1.0 mm EDTA, and 0.1 mmPMSF by repeating homogenization and centrifugation three times. The inclusion bodies were further washed with 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0) containing 2% (w/v) Triton X-100, 1.0 mmDTT, 1.0 mm EDTA, and 0.1 mm PMSF in the same way. After these treatments, purity of the inclusion bodies was assessed to be more than 90% on the basis of SDS-PAGE analysis. The inclusion bodies obtained were solubilized in 6 m urea buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1.0 mm DTT, 1.0 mm EDTA, and 0.1 mmPMSF and stirred at 4 °C overnight. The protein solutions were cleared by centrifugation in an SS34 rotor at 12,000 rpm for 15 min, and the supernatants were recovered. The solubilized subunits were applied onto a DEAE-Toyopearl column (3.0 × 10 cm) equilibrated with the same buffer. The column was extensively washed with the equilibration buffer, and the absorbed proteins were eluted with a linear gradient of NaCl (0–0.3 m) in the same buffer. Typically, the subunits were eluted as a single peak. The fractions were pooled, and the purity was checked by SDS-PAGE. Usually the subunits thus obtained were electrophoretically homogeneous. If further purification was needed, the following chromatography was carried out. The protein fractions were dialyzed against 1 liter of 6 murea buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1.0 mm DTT, 1.0 mm EDTA, and 0.1 mmPMSF overnight. The solutions were applied onto a DEAE-Bio-Gel column (1.5 × 10 cm) equilibrated with the same buffer. The column was washed with the equilibration buffer, and the absorbed proteins were eluted by a linear gradient of NaCl (0–0.3 m) in the same buffer. The fractions were collected and used for the experiments. For the expression inP. denitrificans a broad range host plasmid pEG400 was used (25Gerhus E. Grisshammer R. Michel H. Ludwig B. Turba A. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1993; 113: 29-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). In order to express the nqo9 gene, we used a promoter region of cycA gene that encodes cytochromec550 (26Van Spanning R.J.M. Wansell C. Harms N. Oltmann L.F. Stouthamer A.H. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 986-996Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The promoter is known to be active in a regulative manner depending upon energy sources on which the cells grow (27Stoll R. Page M.D. Sambongi Y. Ferguson S.J. Microbiology. 1996; 142: 2577-2585Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The promoter region (∼240 base pairs) was amplified by polymerase chain reaction method with the following oligonucleotides: cycAF, 5′- GGA TCC TCT AGAGTCGAC ATG GGC CTG CC-3′; cycAR, 5′-CAT ACATAT GAT CTT CAT CGC GTT TCC TC-3′. The forward primer, cycAF, was designed to have BamHI (GGATCC) andXbaI (TCTAGA) in addition to SalI (GTCGAC) at the 5′ end for the convenience of DNA manipulation (underlined letters). Italic letters indicated altered sequences from the original. The reverse primer, cycAR, contains an NdeI site (CATATG, underlined letters) 6 base pairs downstream from the translation initiation codon keeping the first methionine and alanine in frame. Altered sequences were indicated in italic. In other words, a gene of interest is expressed under the cycA promoter having extra amino acid sequences, Met-Ala, at its N-terminal end. The polymerase chain reaction-amplified DNA segment was subcloned in pCR-script II (Stratagene), and its sequences were verified by sequencing of both strands. A clone containing the cycA promoter region in a particular direction was chosen and designated as pCR(PcycA). The pCR(PcycA) was digested with SalI and BamHI and re-cloned inSalI and BamHI sites of pTZ18U and named pTZ18(PcycA). Meanwhile, one of the NQO9 plasmids such as pCR(NQO9Δ1–30) was digested with NdeI andBamHI and the DNA fragments containing theΔnqo9 gene were then ligated in the NdeI andBamHI sites of the pTZ18(PcycA) prepared above. Clones were selected and designated pTZ18(PcycA-NQO9Δ1–30). The pTZ18(PcycA-NQO9 Δ1–30) was subsequently digested with EcoRI andPstI, and the DNA fragments containing the cycA promoter +Δnqo9 gene were ligated at EcoRI andPstI sites of pEG400. In this way, three plasmids were constructed and designated pEG400(PcycA-NQO9 Δ1–30), pEG400(PcycA-NQO9 Δ1–30, Δ151–163), and pEG400(PcycA-NQO9 Δ1–30, Δ141–163) and used for expression study. The expression plasmids described above were transferred into P. denitrificans strain Pd1222 by conjugation through E. coli strain SM10 according to Ref. 26Van Spanning R.J.M. Wansell C. Harms N. Oltmann L.F. Stouthamer A.H. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 986-996Crossref PubMed Google Scholar. The transformed P. denitrificans cells were selected on a brain heart infusion (BHI) plate containing 40 μg/ml rifampicin and 25 μg/ml streptomycin. A single and well isolated colony was picked up and spread onto a new plate containing the same antibiotics. The transformants were grown in liquid BHI medium to late exponential phase. The cell pellets were suspended in 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0) containing 1.0 mm DTT, 1.0 mm EDTA, and 0.1 mmPMSF to be approximately 20% (w/v). The cell suspensions were freeze-thawed twice with liquid nitrogen and a 30 °C water bath and sonicated with a Brownson sonifier attached to a narrow tip at an amplitude of 5 with 50% pulse mode for 5 min. The suspensions were centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 10 min in an SS34 rotor to separate from unbroken cells. The resultant cell-free extracts were then ultracentrifuged at 50,000 rpm for 60 min in 60Ti rotor. The supernatants were carefully recovered and subjected to Western analysis. Quantitative immunoblotting was carried out according to Hekman et al. (23Hekman C. Tomich J.M. Hatefi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13564-13571Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The amounts of bound primary antibodies were detected with 125I-protein A (250,000 cpm/ml) dissolved in 1× phosphate-buffered saline containing 2% (w/v) skim milk after incubation with the PVDF membranes for 1 h at room temperature. The membranes were washed with 1× phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.3% (w/v) Tween 20 for 10 min three times. The membranes were air-dried and exposed to Fuji medical x-ray film overnight at room temperature. Radioactive bands were then excised from the membranes, and the radioactivity associated with each band was determined by a γ-counter. Protein was estimated by the method of Lowry et al. (28Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in the presence of 1 mg/ml potassium deoxycholate (29Bensadoun A.

Acrylamide,N,N′-methylenebis(acrylamide), SDS, SDS-PAGE marker proteins, Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250, DEAE-Bio-Gel were from Bio-Rad. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugating affinity purified antibodies to rabbit IgG and ECL kit were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. DEAE-Toyopearl resin was from Tosohaas. Expression vector, pET11a, and E. coli strain BL21(DE3) were from Novagen. A broad host-range plasmid, pEG400, was kindly supplied by Dr. Bernd Ludwig (Johann Wolfgang Goethe-Universität, Germany). A clone containing cycA gene, P. denitrificans strain, Pd1222, and E. coli strain SM10 were generous gifts from Dr. Rob van Spanning (Vrije Universiteit, The Netherlands). In the present study, we thoroughly investigated topological properties of 7 subunits (NQO1, NQO2, NQO3, NQO4, NQO5, NQO6, and NQO9) of the P. denitrificans NDH-1. Although function of the individual subunits is not yet fully understood, it seems likely that the electron transfer reaction from NADH takes place through these subunits since the redox components, FMN, and all iron-sulfur clusters reside in them. Of particular interest is the localization of the NQO6 and NQO9 subunits in NDH-1. One of these subunits is postulated to bear the cluster N2 that plays a key role in electron transfer to quinone. We conducted extraction experiments of the subunits with several chaotropic reagents or alkaline solutions and subunit-specific antibodies. Treatment with these reagents has been known to disrupt protein-protein interactions to some extent and to extract extrinsic proteins from membranes (35Hatefi Y. Ragan C.I. Galante Y.M. Martonosi A.N. The Enzymes of Biological Membranes. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1985: 1-70Google Scholar, 36Azevedo J.E. Nehls U. Eckerskorn C. Heinrich H. Rothe H. Weiss H. Werner S. Biochem. J. 1992; 288: 29-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Although the structure of the enzyme complex at an atomic level is not yet available, information obtained in these experiments is still beneficial to understanding the rough structure of the enzyme complex. Some of the results have been reported previously concerning the NQO4, NQO5, and NQO6 subunits (24Takano S. Yano T. Yagi T. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 9120-9127Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). When the membrane-embedded NDH-1 enzyme complex was treated with NaI, all the subunits were extracted into the supernatants (Fig. 1), whereas treatment with a high concentration of NaCl scarcely extracted the subunits. A noticeable observation is that the extent of extraction with NaBr varied among the subunits. The NQO1 and NQO2 were largely extracted, whereas the NQO3 and NQO4 were moderately extracted, and the release of the NQO5, NQO6, and NQO9 subunits from the membranes was slight. Moreover, when urea was used, the NQO6 and NQO9 remained in the membranes, whereas the other subunits were almost completely extracted. When the membranes were incubated in alkaline buffer, all subunits could be extracted from membranes to greater extents as pH increased from 10 to 12 (Fig. 1). These results demonstrate that all the subunits are extractable from the membranes, but the extraction of the NQO6 and NQO9 subunits is less effective than the other subunits. It can be speculated, therefore, that the NQO6 and NQO9 subunits are directly associated with the membrane part of the complex (NQO7, NQO8, and NQO10–14 subunits). Other groups have also expressed a similar view (37Finel M. Skehel J.M. Albracht S.P.J. Fearnley I.M. Walker J.E. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 11425-11434Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 38Leif H. Sled V.D. Ohnishi T. Weiss H. Friedrich T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 230: 538-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Of interest is that the topological character of the NQO9 subunit found in this study seems to be compatible with the results of expression studies reported in the accompanying paper and also see Ref.18Yano T. Yagi T. Sled' V.D. Ohnishi T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18264-18270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar. The full-length form of NQO9 was expressed in the cytoplasmic membranes in E. coli, whereas the deletion of the hydrophobic N-terminal stretches made the subunit completely water-soluble. We attempted to express these truncated forms of the NQO9 subunit in P. denitrificans itself in order to see whether the same phenomena could be observed. We utilized a promoter region of the cycA gene that encoded cytochromec550. The nqo9 genes encoding truncated subunits NQO9(Δ1–30), NQO9(Δ1–30, Δ151–163), and NQO9(Δ1–40, Δ151–163) were linked under a cycA promoter on a broad host-range plasmid, pEG400, respectively. The constructs were transferred into P. denitrificans strain Pd1222 throughE. coli strain SM10 by conjugation (see “Experimental Procedures”). Transformants were isolated on BHI plates containing streptomycin + rifampicin and were aerobically grown in BHI liquid medium. In order to avoid undesired recombination events, experiments were conducted with freshly transformed cells each time. Cytoplasmic fractions were prepared from individual transformants and subjected to Western blotting analysis. The truncated subunits could be readily distinguished from the native form of the NQO9 subunit by the difference in molecular size. It is clear in Fig.2 that all truncated forms of the NQO9 subunit were expressed in cytoplasm of P. denitrificans in a manner similar to the expression in E. coli (see the accompanying paper). It is noteworthy that the hydrophobic N-terminal region of the NQO9 subunit and its homologues (corresponding to 30 amino acid residue long of the P. denitrificans NQO9 subunit) is predicted to form α-helix (data not shown). It can be speculated, therefore, that the hydrophobic N-terminal stretches of the NQO9 subunit may play an important role in its association with the membrane part of the enzyme complex in a manner similar to the Rieske iron-sulfur subunit of ubiquinol-cytochrome c oxidoreductase complex. Although the Rieske iron-sulfur subunit is extractable from membranes by the same treatment used in this study, its hydrophobic and less conserved N-terminal region has been found to lie in the membrane together with α-helical bundles of the cytochrome bsubunit as depicted by x-ray structure (39Xia D., Yu, C.A.

Link T.A. Ramaswamy S. Jap B.K. Science. 1998; 281: 64-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (1071) Google Scholar). The proteolytic cleavage or genetic deletion of the N-terminal stretch of the Rieske iron-sulfur cluster subunit of mitochondrial and bacterial ubiquinol-cytochrome c oxidoreductase complex have resulted in the recovery or expression of soluble forms of the iron-sulfur cluster domain (41Saribas A.S.

Further experiments are needed to examine this notion in the future. On the other hand, information concerning the NQO6 subunit is limited. The NQO6 subunit is also relatively hydrophobic. The expressed NQO6 subunit is localized in the membrane ofE. coli in a manner similar to the case of the NQO9 subunit (24Takano S. Yano T. Yagi T. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 9120-9127Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), and the products can be extracted from the membranes only in the presence of detergents. 2T. Yano, T. Ohnishi, and T. Yagi, unpublished results. Further characterization of the subunit is underway in our laboratory.Figure 2Expression of the truncated forms of the NQO9 subunit in P. denitrificans.

A small quantity of the NQO9 subunit contaminated from the membrane fractions was detected (marked byasterisk).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) It is important to determine the stoichiometric ratios of all the subunits constituting the NDH-1 enzyme complex since such information will provide the structural basis to clarify the mechanism of action of the enzyme complex. Particularly, determination of the copy number of the cofactor-binding subunits in the enzyme complex will make it possible to estimate the number of cofactors at a protein level. Many attempts have been made in the past to determine the number of cofactors in the mitochondrial complex I by analyzing the contents of FMN, non-heme iron, and acid-labile sulfide (42Ragan C.I. Galante Y.M. Hatefi Y. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 2518-2524Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 43Hatefi Y. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 1015-1069Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, a clear answer has not yet been found mainly due to technical difficulties and some intrinsic problems associated with the materials used. In the previous study, the stoichiometric ratios of the NQO1–6 subunits of P. denitrificans NDH-1 have been determined by a radioimmunological method (24Takano S. Yano T. Yagi T. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 9120-9127Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). This method is known to be reliable for estimating the quantity of particular polypeptides in crude preparations or multi-subunit enzyme complexes (23Hekman C. Tomich J.M. Hatefi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13564-13571Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 44Belogrudov G.I. Hatefi Y. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 4571-4576Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). We employed the same approach to determine the stoichiometry of the NQO9 subunit in this study. Contents of the NQO9 subunit as well as NQO1, NQO2, and NQO4 subunits in the cholate-treated P. denitrificanscytoplasmic membranes were determined. The individual subunits were expressed in E. coli, and the polypeptides were homogeneously purified and used as standard proteins (Fig.3). In order to determine the correct stoichiometric ratio of the subunits in the enzyme complex, a painstaking effort was made to determine the protein concentrations as accurately as possible. Two methods were employed. The protein concentrations were determined for each standard subunit solution by Lowry's method and corrected using values obtained by amino acid composition analysis. Known amounts of the individual standard subunits and P. denitrificans membranes were loaded on a Laemmli's SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and the proteins were transferred onto PVDF membranes. The immobilized proteins were quantitated on the membranes by radioimmunoassay as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Fig. 4 depicts one of the examples where the NQO9 subunits were detected by autoradiography after incubation with anti-NQO9 subunit antiserum followed by 125I-protein A. Quantitation of bound 125I relative to the amounts of loaded proteins gave reasonable linear relationships in ranges of 0–20 ng for the standard proteins and 0–1.0 μg for the P. denitrificans membranes. By comparing the slopes of the lines between the standard and experimental plots, the contents of the individual subunits in the membranes (nanomoles of subunit/mg of protein) were calculated. The stoichiometric ratios of the subunits relative to NQO1 were then obtained (TableI). The stoichiometric ratio of NQO9 subunit to NQO1 subunit was found to be 0.95, whereas those of the NQO2 and NQO4 subunits were 0.97 and 1.04, respectively. The results of the NQO2 and NQO4 subunits are in a good agreement with the previous report (24Takano S. Yano T. Yagi T. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 9120-9127Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Since it is believed that the mitochondrial complex I and bacterial NDH-1 are present as a monomer (20Friedrich T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1364: 134-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 45Weiss H. Friedrich T. Hofhaus G. Preis D. Eur. J.

Biophys. 1992; 25: 253-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (681) Google Scholar), it seems likely that these 7 peripheral subunits are all present as one molecule each in the enzyme complex (Table I). These results also allow us to estimate the total number of the cofactors, considering the fact that FMN and all iron-sulfur clusters are located in these subunits. It seem likely that the P. denitrificans NDH-1 enzyme complex contains one molecule of FMN and up to 8 iron-sulfur clusters, 2×[2Fe-2S] and 6×[4Fe-4S] (TableII). Mitochondrial complex I andRhodobacter capsulatus NDH-1 may contain the same number of cofactors as P. denitrificans NDH-1 because they are predicted to have the same number of cofactor-binding sites (21Dupuis A. Chevallet M. Darrouzet E. Duborjal H. Lunardi J. Issartel J.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1364: 147-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 46Walker J.E. Q. Rev. Biophys. 1992; 25: 253-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (681) Google Scholar). In the case of E. coli and Thermus thermophilusNDH-1, the total number of iron-sulfur clusters can be 9 since they seem to contain an additional [2Fe-2S] cluster that is tentatively designated cluster N1c (also see Table II) (47Weidner U.

It seems likely that the P. denitrificansNDH-1 enzyme complex contains one FMN and up to 8 iron-sulfur clusters. The extraction experiments have suggested that the NQO6 and NQO9 subunits are directly associated with the membrane part of the enzyme complex, constituting a junction between the peripheral and membrane portions as shown in Fig. 5. In this connection, it has been suggested that the hydrophobic N-terminal stretch of the NQO9 subunit plays a structurally important role. Recently, the NQO6 subunit and its mitochondrial counterpart, PSST subunit, have been identified as a conserved specific binding site for very hydrophobic complex I inhibitors such as pyridaben, rotenone, and piericidin A (49Schuler F. Yano T. Di Bernardo S. Yagi T. Yankovskaya V. Singer T.P. Casida J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4149-4153Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Our results described here are also consistent with those findings with respect to the fact that the subunit is partially surrounded by a hydrophobic environment. Both NQO6 and NQO9 subunits appear to be important for the energy transduction at site 1. It is conceivable, therefore, that further characterization of these subunits will be a crucial step toward the elucidation of the mechanism of action of the enzyme complex."
https://openalex.org/W2008646227,"In L6 skeletal muscle cells expressing human insulin receptors (L6(hIR)), exposure to 25 mM glucose for 3 min induced a rapid 3-fold increase in GLUT1 and GLUT4 membrane translocation and glucose uptake. The high glucose concentration also activated the insulin receptor kinase toward the endogenous insulin receptor substrates (IRS)-1 and IRS-2. At variance, in L6 cells expressing kinase-deficient insulin receptors, the exposure to 25 mM glucose elicited no effect on glucose disposal. In the L6(hIR) cells, the acute effect of glucose on insulin receptor kinase was paralleled by a 2-fold decrease in both the membrane and the insulin receptor co-precipitated protein kinase C (PKC) activities and a 3-fold decrease in receptor Ser/Thr phosphorylation. Western blotting of the receptor precipitates with isoform-specific PKC antibodies revealed that the glucose-induced decrease in membrane- and receptor-associated PKC activities was accounted for by dissociation of PKCalpha but not of PKCbeta or -delta. This decrease in PKCalpha was paralleled by a similarly sized increase in cytosolic PKCalpha. In intact L6(hIR) cells, inhibition of PKCalpha expression by using a specific antisense oligonucleotide caused a 3-fold increase in IRS phosphorylation by the insulin receptor. This effect was independent of insulin and accompanied by a 2.5-fold increase in glucose disposal by the cells. Thus, in the L6 skeletal muscle cells, glucose acutely regulates its own utilization through the insulin signaling system, independent of insulin. Glucose autoregulation appears to involve PKCalpha dissociation from the insulin receptor and its cytosolic translocation."
https://openalex.org/W2004505772,"MXI1, a member of the MADfamily of Myc antagonists, encodes a transcription factor whose expression must be tightly regulated to maintain normal cell growth and differentiation. To more closely investigate the transcriptional regulation of the human MXI1 gene, we have cloned and characterized the MXI1 promoter. After clarification of the 5′- and 3′-untranslated regions of the cDNA (indicating that the true length of the MXI1 transcript is 2643 base pairs), we identified two transcription initiation sites. We subsequently isolated the MXI1 promoter, which is GC-rich and lacks a TATA box. Although it contains at least six potential initiator sequences, functional studies indicate the proximal two initiator sequences in combination with nearby Sp1 and MED-1 sites together account for virtually all promoter activity. We also demonstrate thatMXI1 promoter activity is repressed by high levels of AP2. These studies provide further insight into the complex regulatory mechanisms governing MXI1 gene expression and its role in cellular differentiation and tumor suppression."

https://openalex.org/W2318562615,"The retinoic acid (RA) receptor beta isoform (RARbeta) plays an important role in RA-induced differentiation of human neuroblastoma. In this study we show that insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) and tetradecanoyl phorbol acetate (TPA) induce RARbeta gene expression in neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells. IGF-1 and TPA caused a marked induction of RARbeta2 promoter activity and had a synergistic effect with RA that also upregulates transcription. The effect of RA is mediated by two RA responsive elements (RAREs), whereas the IGF-1 and TPA actions are independent of the RAREs and map to sequences that overlap the TATA box. These results suggest that the signaling pathways stimulated by TPA and IGF-1 could modify the components assembled at the core RARbeta2 promoter and activate transcription. Expression of RasVal12 mimics the effect of IGF-1 and TPA on the promoter, and a dominant negative Ras mutant abrogates activation. A dominant negative Raf also blocks activation showing that the Ras-Raf pathway mediates stimulation of the RARbeta2 promoter. Our results show that neuronal differentiation induced by non-retinoid agents that activate Ras is accompanied by increased transcription of the RARbeta gene."

TFIIIC and TFIIIA, the other components of the core transcription apparatus, bind DNA and serve as assembly factors for TFIIIB; the six-subunit TFIIIC interacts directly with TFIIIB, and TFIIIA serves as a 5 S rRNA gene-specific platform for TFIIIC. TFIIIB is composed of three subunits: the TATA-binding protein (TBP), Brf, and B“ (Tfc5). TBP co-directs binding of TFIIIB to very strong TATA boxes. At promoters that lack these intrinsic TBP-binding sites, TFIIIC functions as an assembly factor that deposits TFIIIB on its upstream DNA site (reviewed in Ref. 1White R.J. RNA Polymerase III Transcription. 2nd Ed. Springer-Verlag/Landes Bioscience, New York1998Crossref Google Scholar). In both kinds of situations, TBP is located close to DNA (2Persinger J.

Its designation as the TFIIB-relatedfactor derives from the homology of its N-proximal half to TFIIB (3Buratowski S. Zhou H.

Just as TFIIB is able to recruit pol II to the transcriptional start site, so the principal polymerase recruitment capacity of TFIIIB resides in the corresponding, N-proximal, half of Brf. The C-proximal half of Brf is pol III-specific (6Khoo B. Brophy B. Jackson S.P. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2879-2890Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), and has no sequence-homologous counterparts in the pol I and pol II transcription apparati. The principal TBP and B“ affinities of Brf, and also its TFIIIC affinity, reside in this C-proximal half (7Kassavetis G.A. Kumar A. Ramirez E. Geiduschek E.P. Mol. Cell.

However, the N-proximal half of Brf alone has sufficient affinity for TBP and B” to form a TFIIIB-DNA complex at a strong TATA box that is able to recruit pol III to accurately initiated transcription (7Kassavetis G.A. Kumar A. Ramirez E. Geiduschek E.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5587-5599Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Since TFIIB and the N-proximal half of Brf sit in corresponding locations in their respective DNA complexes (7Kassavetis G.A. Kumar A. Ramirez E. Geiduschek E.P. Mol. Cell.

In fact, the 594-amino acid B“ is absolutely required for transcription by pol III, in duplex DNA or chromatin, at TATA-containing and TATA-less promoters, in vivo as well as in vitro. It is also B” that makes the TFIIIB-DNA complex extraordinarily stable (9Kassavetis G.A. Braun B.R. Nguyen L.H. Geiduschek E.P.

In the experiments that are reported here, we have mapped B“ along its DNA site in the TFIIIB-DNA complex; B” external and internal deletion proteins that form stable TFIIIB-DNA complexes have been examined by photochemical protein-DNA cross-linking along the extended DNA site in order to find out which of these deletions alter the interaction of B“ with DNA or change the orientation of B” relative to DNA.

Primer extension to add ABdUMP (5-[N-(p-azidobenzoyl)-3-aminoallyl]-deoxyuridine monophosphate) and [32P]dNMP utilized 1 unit of exonuclease-free Klenow fragment (incubation for 5 min at 37 °C with 10 μm ABdUTP and 0.5 μm appropriate [α-32P]dNTP). Extension of the photoactive DNA strand was completed by an additional 10-min incubation with 500 μm unlabeled dNTPs.

For probes −19/−17, −14/−12, and −3/−2, this process left an upstream, 22-nucleotide 3′ overhang. An upstream oligonucleotide (the same as the primer for making the −38/−37 probe) was annealed and ligated to these constructs as the final step in preparing the corresponding photoactive 183-bp DNA.

Ten pmol of B“-(138–594) was incubated for 30 min at 21 °C with 25 units of bovine heart muscle kinase and 5 μm [γ-32P]ATP (6,000 Ci/mmol) in buffer containing 20 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 10 mm MgCl2, 100 mm NaCl, and 2.5 mm dithiothreitol (11Kumar A.

Unincorporated [γ-32P]ATP was removed, and efficiency of phosphorylation determined as described (11Kumar A. Kassavetis G.A. Geiduschek E.P. Hambalko M. Brent C.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1868-1880Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Protein-SUP4gene complexes were allowed to form for 60 min at 21 °C in 20 μl of pol III buffer (40 mm Tris-Cl (pH 8.0), 100 mm NaCl, 7 mm MgCl2, 3 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 4–6% (v/v) glycerol, and 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin) containing 0.2–2 fmol of SUP4photoprobe, 18.7 fmol of TFIIIC, 200 fmol of B“ (full-length or mutant), 50 fmol of TBP, 64 fmol of Brf, and 200 ng of pLNG56 (nonspecific carrier) DNA (9Kassavetis G.A. Braun B.R. Nguyen L.H. Geiduschek E.P. Cell. 1990; 60: 235-245Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). After incubation with heparin (200 μg/ml), samples were UV-irradiated for 5 min, as described (16Bartholomew B. Kassavetis G.A. Geiduschek E.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 5181-5189Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). A 6-μl aliquot of each sample was loaded on non-denaturing 4% polyacrylamide gel containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 2 mm EDTA, and 4% (v/v) glycerol (with 20 mmTris, 2 mm EDTA running buffer). The remaining material of each sample was treated with DNase I (7.5 units) and S1 nuclease (80 units), and resolved by 8% SDS-PAGE. 32P-Tagged (cross-linked) proteins were visualized and quantified by phosphoimaging using software provided with the imager. TFIIIB complexes were assembled on SNR6 photoprobes with 400 fmol of TBPm3, 64 fmol of Brf, 200 fmol of B” (full-length or mutant), and 5 fmol of an SNR6 photoprobe, incubated for 60 min at 21 °C in 20 μl of pol III buffer containing 50–70 mm (instead of 100 mm) NaCl and 100 ng of poly(dG-dC)·poly(dG-dC) (instead of pLNG56). Reaction mixtures were treated with 200 ng of poly(dA-dT)·poly(dA-dT) (in place of heparin), UV-irradiated, and processed as described above and elsewhere (12Bartholomew B. Tinker R.L. Kassavetis G.A. Geiduschek E.P. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 262: 476-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Photochemically cross-linked reaction mixtures were prepared with 800 fmol of TBPm3, 64 fmol of Brf, 80 fmol of32P-labeled B“-(138–594), and 50–100 fmol of the appropriate unlabeled SNR6 photoprobe in 20 μl of pol III buffer (with 40–50 mm in place of 100 mmNaCl). For protein complexes with the SUP4 gene, 30 fmol of the appropriate unlabeled photoprobe was incubated with 18.7 fmol of TFIIIC, 100 fmol of TBP, 64 fmol of Brf, and 33 fmol of32P-labeled B”-(138–594) in 20 μl of pol III buffer (with 100 mm NaCl). After UV irradiation, 0.6 pmol of unlabeled B“ was added (to reduce the background due to free32P-labeled B”) and proteins were resolved by 6% SDS-PAGE to separate DNA-cross-linked 32P-labeled B“ from free B”. The corresponding bands were visualized by phosphoimaging and excised from the gel. Proteins were passively eluted overnight into buffer containing 10 mm Tris-Cl (pH 8.0), 0.2% (w/v) SDS, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, and 25 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, and concentrated by ultrafiltration. Eluted proteins were subjected to partial cleavage with 100 mm CNBr or 10 mm NTCB. For CNBr partial cleavage, samples were brought to low pH with 1% SDS and 0.05n HCl. CNBr (100 mm) was then added for 20 min at 21 °C. Further reaction was quenched by adding 0.25 volumes of 100 mg/ml dithiothreitol in 1 m NaHepes (pH 7.8). For NTCB partial cleavage, samples were treated with 10 mm NTCB for 30 min at 37 °C for cyanylation of cysteine residues. The pH was then adjusted to 9.0 with Tris base, and samples were incubated overnight at 37 °C for the subsequent proteolytic cleavage. The32P-labeled fragments generated by NTCB or CNBr cleavage were resolved on 11–15% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Comparisons of cleavage patterns of free and DNA-cross-linked 32P-labeled B“ were made on phosphoimage profiles. Previous examination of the internal structure of a TFIIIB-DNA complex by photochemical cross-linking revealed that B“ cross-links to DNA between 43 and 2 bp upstream of the transcriptional start site (16Bartholomew B. Kassavetis G.A. Geiduschek E.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 5181-5189Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 17Kassavetis G.A. Kumar A. Letts G.A. Geiduschek E.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9196-9201Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In order to map the locations of individual domains of B” relative to DNA, we have analyzed the photochemical cross-linking patterns of B“ with internal and external deletions, using ABdUMP incorporated at specific sites along the TFIIIB-binding sites of the SUP4 andSNR6 genes (Fig. 1). Each DNA photoprobe also has a radioactive nucleotide incorporated next to, or in close vicinity to, its photoactive nucleotide(s). TFIIIB complexes containing either full-length or truncated B” were assembled on each of these DNA photoprobes; reaction mixtures were then UV-irradiated, digested with nucleases, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The efficiency of TFIIIB-DNA complex formation was monitored in parallel by electrophoretic mobility-shift analysis of an UV-irradiated, but not nuclease-treated, portion of each reaction mixture. If deletion of a specific segment of B“ results in the loss of cross-linking at a particular DNA site, this suggests localization of that peptide segment in the vicinity of that DNA site (so long as complex formation is not correspondingly diminished). In the case of the SNR6 gene promoter, unidirectional assembly of TFIIIB-DNA complexes is specified by a modified TATA-box (TGTAAATA) in conjunction with the mutant TBPm3 (15Whitehall S.K. Kassavetis G.A. Geiduschek E.P. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2974-2985Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). At the SUP4 tRNA promoter, with its very weak TATA box, TFIIIB-DNA complex assembly requires the transcription factor TFIIIC, and is unidirectional (15Whitehall S.K. Kassavetis G.A. Geiduschek E.P. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2974-2985Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Efficiencies of forming heparin-stable TFIIIB-DNA complexes and photochemical cross-linking of each B“ deletion mutant and wild type B” were compared for the photoactive DNA probes shown in Fig. 1 A. B“ lacking its N-terminal 262 amino acids or its C-terminal 130 amino acids remains competent to assemble into a heparin-resistant TFIIIB-DNA complex via the TFIIIC-dependent assembly pathway on the SUP4gene (but does so relatively inefficiently; Ref. 11Kumar A. Kassavetis G.A. Geiduschek E.P. Hambalko M. Brent C.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1868-1880Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Full-length B” cross-linked most efficiently to ABdUMP positioned between bp −38 and bp −32 on the SUP4 gene (Fig.2 A; cf. Ref. 16Bartholomew B. Kassavetis G.A. Geiduschek E.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 5181-5189Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Removal of 223 or 262 amino acids from the N terminus of B“ increased the efficiency of cross-linking between bp −38 and bp −30 more than 2-fold compared with full-length B” (adjusted for differences in formation of heparin-resistant complexes; TableI, part A, and Fig. 2 A). Further downstream, between bp −26 and −2, the cross-linking efficiencies of B“-(224–594) and full-length B” did not differ significantly.Table IB“ deletions: effects on patterns of cross-linking to the SUP4 and SRN6 genesA.

The combination of low level formation of heparin-resistant TFIIIB-DNA complexes with B“-(263–594) and low efficiency cross-linking of B” between bp −26 and bp −2, resulted in cross-linking signals too close to background to be reliably quantified, but the observed levels were consistent with unimpaired cross-linking of B“-(263–594) at these positions (Table I, part A). C-terminally truncated B”-(1–464) and B“-(1–487) were not sufficiently well resolved from Brf in SDS-PAGE to quantify reliably. It was, however, possible to assess that B”-(1–487) was not significantly impaired in cross-linking to bp −38/−37, −33/−32, and −30, where B“ cross-links efficiently (Table I, part A). N-and-C-terminally truncated B”-(40–487) did resolve well from Brf, and its cross-linking to all probes tested was unimpaired (TableI, part A, and Fig. 2 B). These results indicate that the cross-links of B“ to the SUP4 gene (more specifically to the bp −38/−2 segment of this gene) primarily involve its amino acid 224–487 segment; this is also the active core of B” forSUP4 transcription (11Kumar A. Kassavetis G.A. Geiduschek E.P. Hambalko M. Brent C.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1868-1880Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Internal deletion mutants of B“, which span much of the region of B” not covered by the N- and C-terminal truncations, and which are capable of being assembled into heparin-resistant DNA complexes, were also examined. Only B“ with amino acids 291–310 deleted displayed a defect in cross-linking, predominantly with probe −38/−37 for which cross-linking efficiency is reduced more than 10-fold (Fig. 2 C, lanes 3 and 5) and, to a lesser extent, with probes −33/−32 and −30 (Table I, part A). Fig. 2 C shows two other aspects of this defect. 1) Heparin did not diminish cross-linking of intact B“ (lanes 2 and 3), but substantially reduced cross-linking of B”Δ291–310 without substantially reducing the cross-linking of Brf (lanes 4 and 5). 2) Full-length B“ displaced the 120-kDa subunit of TFIIIC from the vicinity of the photoactive nucleotide in the −39/−38 photoprobe (comparelanes 1 and 2), but B”Δ291–310 did not (lane 4). On the SNR6 gene (18Brow D.A. Guthrie C. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1345-1356Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 19Margottin F. Dujardin G. Gerard M. Egly J.M. Huet J. Sentenac A. Science. 1991; 251: 424-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), B“ truncated by N-terminal deletion to amino acid 186 or by C-terminal deletion to amino acid 487 was not deficient in cross-linking (Table I, part B). N-terminal truncation to amino acid 224 or 263 somewhat lowered cross-linking at bp −13/−12 and −5 (20–40% of that obtained with intact B”; Table I, part B), but a comparable depression of cross-linking was not observed when TFIIIB complexes with theSUP4 gene were probed at the close-by −14/−12 and −3/−2 sites (Table I, part A). Since no single region of B“ is required for TFIIIB-SNR6 DNA complex formation, a more complete set of internal deletions, spanning regions not covered by N- and C-terminal truncations, could be examined at this promoter. B” cross-links most efficiently to bp −39/−38 on the SNR6 gene (7Kassavetis G.A. Kumar A. Ramirez E. Geiduschek E.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5587-5599Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar); only at bp −33 and −13/−12 do cross-linking efficiencies exceed 10% of cross-linking to bp −39/−38. Only B“Δ272–292 was deficient in cross-linking to probe −39/−38 (20% of the efficiency of cross-linking to intact B”; Table I, part B, and Fig. 2 D). Curiously, B“Δ291–310, which was deficient for cross-linking at a similar location on the SUP4 gene, was not significantly impaired for cross-linking on the SNR6 gene (Table I and Fig. 2; B”Δ272–292 was not examined on the SUP4 gene because it does not assemble into a stable, heparin-resistant complex; Ref. 11Kumar A. Kassavetis G.A. Geiduschek E.P. Hambalko M. Brent C.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1868-1880Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). B“Δ424–438 displayed somewhat lower cross-linking to bp −28 and −13/−12 (20–40% of the cross-linking efficiency with intact B”) and B“Δ409–421 was somewhat impaired in cross-linking to bp −5 (40% efficiency relative to intact B”). Comparisons of cross-linking to the SUP4 and SNR6genes are complicated by the fact that TFIIIC positions TFIIIB somewhat heterogeneously onto the AT-rich upstream sequence of theSUP4 gene (20Joazeiro C.A.P. Kassavetis G.A. Geiduschek E.P. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 725-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), whereas assembly on the SNR6 gene directed by TBPm3 is fixed at the TGTA box. One would therefore expect a “blurring” in the B“ cross-linking pattern to the SUP4gene relative to SNR6 (i.e. efficient cross-linking between bp −38 and −30 on the SUP4 gene, but predominantly at bp −39/−38 on the SNR6 gene). Conversely, even if as few as 2% of TFIIIB complexes on the SNR6 gene were bound in the reverse orientation (cf. Ref. 15Whitehall S.K. Kassavetis G.A. Geiduschek E.P. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2974-2985Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), they might make a significant contribution to cross-linking at bp −13/−12 (through the B” segment that cross-links efficiently to bp −39/−38 in the opposite orientation of TFIIIB). B“ assembly into a TFIIIB-DNA complex buries two regions that are more surface-exposed in the free protein (as judged by hydroxyl radical footprinting): region I, covering amino acids ∼390–470; and region II, covering amino acids ∼270–305 (11Kumar A. Kassavetis G.A. Geiduschek E.P. Hambalko M. Brent C.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1868-1880Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The above experiments clearly suggest that region II lies close to the major sites of B” cross-linking on the SNR6 andSUP4 genes (since B“Δ291–310 depressed cross-linking to the SUP4 gene and B”Δ272–292 to the SNR6gene). In order to gain further information about the location of region II relative to DNA, B“ was split at amino acid 370 (which is highly accessible to hydroxyl radical cleavage in TFIIIB-DNA complexes; Ref. 11Kumar A. Kassavetis G.A. Geiduschek E.P. Hambalko M. Brent C.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1868-1880Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Heparin-resistant TFIIIB-DNA complexes can be formed on both the SUP4 and SNR6 genes only when both parts of this split B” (amino acids 1–370 and 371–594) are provided together. The transcriptional activity of these TFIIIB-DNA complexes is, however, diminished (data not shown). Fig. 3compares the cross-linking profiles of wild type and split B“ on theSUP4 and SNR6 genes. Cross-linking to theSUP4 gene at bp −38/−37, −33/−32, and −30 is contributed almost entirely by amino acids 1–370 of B”, but there is some cross-linking of the C-terminal amino acids 371–594 to bp −33/−32 (Fig. 3 A). The weak cross-linking of intact B“ to sites downstream of bp −30 on the SUP4 gene appears to involve solely its C-terminal half. Similarly, B”-(1–370) dominates cross-linking at bp −39/−38 of the SNR6 gene (Fig.3 B), but some cross-linking of the C-terminal segment is also apparent at this site. In contrast to the cross-linking pattern at bp −33/−32 of the SUP4 promoter, most of the cross-linking of B“ at bp −33 of SNR6 is contributed by its C-terminal segment. As on the SUP4 gene, most of the C-terminal B” segment cross-links also to bp −28, −13/−12, and −5, but"

E., Chaika, O. V., and Lewis, R. E. (1998) J. Biol. Chem. 273, 7169–7176). To characterize this survival pathway we used a chimeric receptor (CSF1R/IR) consisting of the ligand-binding domain of the colony-stimulating factor-1 receptor spliced to the cytoplasmic domain of the insulin receptor and a mutated version of the chimeric receptor containing a 12-amino acid deletion of the juxtamembrane domain (CSF1R/IRΔ960). In addition to the inhibition of apoptosis, activation of either the CSF1R/IR or the CSF1R/IRΔ960 rapidly induced membrane ruffling in Rat1 fibroblasts. The small GTPase Rac mediates membrane ruffling. Activated and dominant-inhibitory mutants of Rac and other small GTPases were expressed in Rat1 fibroblasts to examine a potential link between the intracellular pathways that induce membrane ruffling and promote cell survival. The anti-apoptotic action of the CSF1R/IRΔ960 was reversed by dominant-inhibitory RacN17, but not by RasN17 or Cdc42N17. Activated RacV12, but not RasD12 or Cdc42V12, promoted cell survival in the absence of insulin. These data implicate Rac as a mediator of an unique anti-apoptotic signaling pathway activated by the insulin receptor cytoplasmic domain. Mutations in the cytoplasmic domain of the insulin receptor that block the ability of the receptor to stimulate glucose uptake do not block the receptor's ability to inhibit apoptosis (Boehm, J. E., Chaika, O. V., and Lewis, R. E. (1998) J. Biol. Chem. 273, 7169–7176). To characterize this survival pathway we used a chimeric receptor (CSF1R/IR) consisting of the ligand-binding domain of the colony-stimulating factor-1 receptor spliced to the cytoplasmic domain of the insulin receptor and a mutated version of the chimeric receptor containing a 12-amino acid deletion of the juxtamembrane domain (CSF1R/IRΔ960).

These data implicate Rac as a mediator of an unique anti-apoptotic signaling pathway activated by the insulin receptor cytoplasmic domain. The cellular receptor for insulin controls diverse intracellular pathways that regulate metabolism, growth, and development. One conventional approach for identifying the molecular components that constitute these different pathways has been the selective mutagenesis of the receptor's cytoplasmic domain in an effort to discretely dissociate one biological action of insulin from another (1White M.F.

Coincident with the loss of receptor substrate phosphorylation, the Δ960 deletion also blocks the activation of ERK MAP kinases, the activation of PI 3-kinase associated with IRS-1, and the stimulation of glucose transport. However, the Δ960 deletion does not prevent the receptor from inhibiting apoptosis (6Boehm J.E. Chaika O.V. Lewis R.E. J. Biol.

These observations suggested that alternative pathways could contribute to the insulin receptor's anti-apoptotic activity. To identify additional mediators of anti-apoptotic signaling activated by the insulin receptor cytoplasmic domain, other biological effects of the CSF1R/IRΔ960 were investigated. We observed that the CSF1R/IRΔ960 rapidly induced membrane ruffling in a manner dependent on the small GTPase Rac. A contribution of Rac to anti-apoptotic signaling by the chimeric receptor was indicated by the observation that dominant-negative RacN17 blocked survival signals from the CSF1R/IRΔ960. Furthermore, activated RacV12, but not activated RasD12 or Cdc42V12, was sufficient to promote survival in the absence of growth factor stimulation. These results implicate Rac as a mediator of an additional anti-apoptotic signaling pathway activated by the insulin receptor cytoplasmic domain in a manner independent of IRS phosphorylation. cDNAs encoding Myc-tagged RacV12, RacN17, Cdc42V12, Cdc42N17, Ha-RasD12, and Ha-RasN17were gifts from A. Hall (London). Each cDNA was cloned into theEcoRI site of the retroviral vector pSRα. Recombinant retroviruses were made by transfection into a packaging cell line (17Pear W.S. Nolan G.P Scott M.L.

For the expression of activated and dominant-negative forms of Rac, Ras, and Cdc42, Rat1 mycER cells were infected at a multiplicity of infection of at least 5 with ecotropic retroviruses encoding each Myc-tagged cDNA and selected with G418 (400 μg/ml). Cells expressing the CSF1R/IR or the CSF1R/IRΔ960 (5 × 105/35-mm dish) were treated with or without 10 nm CSF-1 or 100 nm insulin for 10 min, lysed, and the phosphorylation state of Akt was determined by Western blot with PhosphoPlus Akt (Ser473) antibodies (New England Biolabs). Akt kinase activity was determined as described previously (19Kulik G. Weber M.J. Mol. Cell.

Rat1mycER (5 × 104) cells expressing the CSF1R/IR or the CSF1R/IRΔ960 were plated onto gridded glass coverslips (Bellco), incubated in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 24 h, and injected as described previously for REF-52 fibroblasts (20Joneson T.

Membrane ruffles were detected in fixed and permeablized cells with 0.01 μg/ml TRITC-phalloidin. Apoptosis in cells stably expressing activated or dominant-negative forms of Ras, Rac 1, or Cdc42 was determined by time-lapse video microscopy (8Harrington E.A. Bennett M.R. Fanidi A. Evan G.I.

Fields of at least 300 cells were used to quantify apoptosis. Apoptosis in cells microinjected with RacN17 was determined by co-injection with 20 ng/μl pEFGFP. Cells were treated with 100 nm tamoxifen, 10 nm CSF-1, or 1 μm insulin as indicated, and cells expressing GFP were observed every 2 h for a total of 20 h. The amount of apoptosis among injected cells was quantified. Cell death caused by microinjection was determined by the injection of pEFGFP alone and subtracted from the amount of death induced by each experimental condition. Microinjected cells expressing GFP were evaluated within the microscopic field for each condition. Each condition was repeated at least five times. Previous studies have shown that mutations in the CSF1R/IR can dissociate its ability to phosphorylate important intracellular substrates from certain receptor-stimulated biological effects (5Chaika O.V.

A 12-amino acid deletion (Δ960) blocks the ability of the CSF1R/IR to phosphorylate IRS-1 and Shc, activate the MAP kinases ERK1 and ERK2, activate PI 3-kinase associated with IRS-1, and stimulate glucose transport (5Chaika O.V.

Despite the uncoupling of these intracellular effectors from the receptor, the CSF1R/IRΔ960 still retains its ability to stimulate adipocyte differentiation (5Chaika O.V. Chaika N. Volle D.J.

However, inhibition of apoptosis and induction of differentiation are assayed over much longer periods of time (hours to days) than the amount of time (minutes) required to detect biological events that are inhibited by the Δ960 mutation. This fact prevented us from excluding the possibility that small amounts of IRS or Shc phosphorylation could result from prolonged activation of the CSF1R/IRΔ960 to inhibit apoptosis or stimulate differentiation. We, therefore, looked for biological effects of insulin that could be mimicked by activation of the CSF1R/IR and occurred over the same rapid time course as the phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrates and the stimulation of glucose uptake. Insulin and insulin-like growth factors rapidly induce membrane ruffling (lamellipodia) in cells (21Bockus B.J. Stiles C.D. Exp. Cell Res. 1984; 153: 186-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 22Kotani K. Yonezawa K. Hara K. Ueda H. Kitamura Y. Sakaue H. Ando A. Chavanieu A. Calas B. Grigorescu F. Nishiyama M. Waterfield M.D. Kasuga M. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2313-2321Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). To investigate the effect of the Δ960 deletion on the ability of the chimeric receptor to stimulate membrane ruffling, Rat1mycER fibroblasts stably expressing the CSF1R/IR, the CSF1R/IRΔ960, or transfected with the expression vector alone were treated with or without 10 nm CSF-1 or 100 nm insulin for 2 min. The cells were fixed immediately, and polymerized actin was detected with TRITC-labeled phalloidin. Fluorescence microscopy revealed that CSF-1 and insulin rapidly induced lamellipodia in cells expressing either the CSF1R/IR or CSF1R/IRΔ960 (Fig. 1). However, in control cells only insulin was able to induce membrane ruffling (Fig. 1). The ability of the CSF1R/IRΔ960 to rapidly stimulate membrane ruffling suggested that the induction of this cytoskeletal rearrangement was not dependent upon IRS and Shc phosphorylation. Lamellipodia formation is dependent upon the activation of the small GTPase Rac (23Ridley A.J. Paterson H.F. Johnston C.L. Diekmann D. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 401-410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3041) Google Scholar). To investigate the role of Rac in lamellipodia formation by the CSF1R/IRΔ960, dominant-inhibitory RacN17 was microinjected into Rat1mycER fibroblasts expressing the CSF1R/IRΔ960, and the cells were treated with CSF-1. Expression of RacN17 blocked the ability of CSF-1 to induce membrane ruffling in microinjected cells, but not in adjacent, uninjected cells (data not shown). We observed previously that the Δ960 mutation blocks the ability of the CSF1R/IR to stimulate PI 3-kinase activity associated with tyrosine phosphorylated proteins, including IRS-1 (6Boehm J.E. Chaika O.V. Lewis R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7169-7176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of the 3′ position of PI is thought to be a key event in the activation of guanine nucleotide exchange factors for Rac (24Han J.W. Luby-Phelps K. Das B. Shu X.D. Xia Y. Mosteller R.D.

Science. 1998; 279: 560-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). Binding of PI(3,4,5)P3 to the pleckstrin homology domain of Akt is also critical to the activation of the serine/threonine kinase (26Franke T.F. Yang S.-I. Chan T.O. Datta K. Kazlauskas A.

To confirm that the CSF1R/IRΔ960 was not activating known PI 3-kinase signaling pathways, the ability of cells expressing the CSF1R/IR or the CSF1R/IRΔ960 to activate Akt was examined. Insulin (100 nm) stimulated the phosphorylation of Akt in cells expressing the CSF1R/IR or the CSF1R/IRΔ960, as determined by Western blotting with an antibody specific for Akt phosphorylated on Ser473. However, only cells expressing the intact CSF1R/IR were able to stimulate phosphorylation in response to CSF-1 treatment (Fig. 2 A). The level of Akt expressed in each treatment group was similar, suggesting that the Δ960 mutation was responsible for the inability of CSF-1 to stimulate Akt phosphorylation in cells expressing the chimeric receptor (Fig.2 B). Similar results were obtained when the kinase activity of Akt was analyzed. CSF-1 stimulated the kinase activity of Akt immunoprecipitated from cells expressing the intact CSF1R/IR but not from cells expressing the CSF1R/IRΔ960 (Fig. 2 C). These data indicate the activation of Akt by the insulin receptor kinase is dependent upon IRS-associated PI 3-kinase activity but that the rapid, Rac-dependent induction of lamellipodia by the CSF1R/IRΔ960 is independent of the activation of PI 3-kinase. Alternatively, a second, distinct PI 3-kinase pathway may also be stimulated independent of IRS proteins by the insulin receptor kinase to activate Rac. PI 3-kinase and Akt are known mediators of growth factor-stimulated anti-apoptotic signaling pathways (10Hossenlopp P. Seurin D. Segovia-Quinson B. Hardouin S. Binoux M. Anal. Biochem. 1986; 154: 138-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (1197) Google Scholar, 11Dudek H. Datta S.R. Franke T.F. Birnbaum M.J. Yao R.J. Cooper G.M. Segal R.A. Kaplan D.R. Greenberg M.E.

Chem. 1998; 273: 7169-7176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) and stimulated Rac-dependent membrane ruffling (Fig.1), but was unable to activate PI 3-kinase (6Boehm J.E. Chaika O.V. Lewis R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7169-7176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) or Akt (Fig. 2) in cells expressing the CSF1R/IRΔ960. These observations raise the possibility that Rac mediates anti-apoptotic signaling by the insulin receptor cytoplasmic domain. To test the role of Rac in anti-apoptotic signaling by insulin, constitutively active or dominant-inhibitory forms of small GTPases were stably expressed in Rat1mycER fibroblasts and tested for their ability to inhibit apoptosis. Rat1mycER cells alone or expressing the different small GTPases were treated with 100 nm tamoxifen to induce apoptosis (18Evan G.I. Wyllie A.H. Gilbert C.S. Littlewood T.D. Land H. Brooks M. Waters C.M. Penn L.Z. Hancock D.C. Cell. 1992; 69: 119-128Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2761) Google Scholar) and with or without 1 μm insulin for 20 h. Cells expressing RacV12 and treated with 100 nm tamoxifen showed a significantly reduced level of apoptosis when compared with control Rat1mycER cells treated with tamoxifen (Fig.3 A). Furthermore, insulin treatment did not enhance the survival of tamoxifen-treated cells expressing RacV12. The protective role of RacV12 in tamoxifen-treated Rat1mycER fibroblasts was further demonstrated by time-lapse video microscopy (Fig.3 B). In contrast, the expression of activated Cdc42V12 showed no ability to protect cells from tamoxifen-induced apoptosis and had no effect on insulin's anti-apoptotic activity, suggesting that Cdc42 is not involved in an insulin-mediated survival pathway (Fig. 3 A). Activated RasD12 also had no protective effect against tamoxifen-induced apoptosis, but instead inhibited the anti-apoptotic activities of insulin. The actions of activated RasD12 are consistent with the observation that activated Ras has pro-apoptotic activity in Rat1mycER cells through its stimulation of ERK MAP kinases (13Kauffman-Zeh A. Rodriguez-Viciana P. Ulrich E. Gilbert C. Coffer P. Downward J. Evan G. Nature. 1997; 385: 544-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (1065) Google Scholar). These results suggest that Rac is distinct in its ability to promote cell survival in the presence of an apoptotic stimulus. The expression of dominant-inhibitory Cdc42N17 or RasN17 in Rat1mycER cells had no effect on tamoxifen-induced apoptosis and did not alter insulin's ability to inhibit tamoxifen-induced apoptosis (Figs. 3, C andD). We were unable to create cell lines stably expressing RacN17. As a second approach toward determining whether Rac contributed to survival signaling, plasmids encoding dominant-inhibitory RacN17 were microinjected into Rat1mycER fibroblasts expressing the CSF1R/IRΔ960 (Fig.4). Apoptosis in untreated cells was 11.5%, whereas tamoxifen treatment alone elevated the level of apoptosis to 36.3%. Tamoxifen treatment in combination with insulin or CSF-1 significantly reduced the amount of apoptosis to 18.9% and 20%, respectively. Untreated cells injected with an expression plasmid encoding RacN17 showed a level of apoptosis comparable with untreated cells or cells treated with tamoxifen plus insulin or CSF-1. Tamoxifen increased apoptosis in cells injected with plasmids encoding RacN17 to the same extent as control injected cells treated with tamoxifen, which demonstrated that dominant-inhibitory RacN17 has no protective effect on the cells. However, the anti-apoptotic effects of insulin and CSF-1 were lost in cells injected with RacN17 (Fig. 4). The data demonstrate that receptor signaling to Rac is independent of the phosphorylation of IRS-1 and Shc, as a deletion in the juxtamembrane domain prevented the chimeric CSF1R/IR (6Boehm J.E.

However, CSF1R/IR activation of Ras-regulated pathways is inhibited by the Δ960 mutation (6Boehm J.E. Chaika O.V. Lewis R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7169-7176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), and neither dominant-inhibitory RasN17 nor Cdc42N17 blocked the ability of the CSF1R/IRΔ960 to induce membrane ruffling (data not shown) or survival (Fig. 3).

The data presented here suggest that growth factors with the ability to activate the small GTPase Rac may stimulate additional pathways to inhibit apoptosis. Rac is an effector of multiple signaling pathways (38Tapon N. Hall A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 86-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar), any one of which may contribute to the inhibition of apoptosis. Activated Rac promotes survival in BaF3 cells in a manner that is inhibited by the p38 kinase inhibitor SB203580 (39Nishida K. Kaziro Y. Satoh T. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 407-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Rac can also activate the NADPH burst oxidase (40Abo A. Pick E. Hall A. Totty N. Teahan C.G. Segal A.W. Nature. 1991; 353: 668-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar), which, in turn, can activate the anti-apoptotic transcription factor NFκβ (41Perona R. Montaner S. Saniger L. Sanchez-Perez I. Bravo R. Lacal J.C. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 463-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar, 42Sulciner D.J. Irani K., Yu, Z.X. Ferrans V.J. Goldschmidt-Clermont P. Finkel T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 16: 7115-7121Crossref Google Scholar). This latter possibility suggests an additional survival pathway dependent on new gene transcription. In this regard, it is interesting to note that a novel anti-apoptotic signaling pathway was recently described for the IGF I receptor that is sensitive to the RNA polymerase II inhibitor α-amanitin (19Kulik G. Weber M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6711-6718Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). The identification of Rac as a transitional element in these biological events should provide a valuable point of reference for the identification and ordering of additional signaling intermediates that regulate cytoskeletal changes and survival by the insulin receptor kinase. We express our appreciation to A. Hall, D. Bar-Sagi, and G. Evan for reagents; to Genetics Institute (Cambridge, MA.) for the invaluable gift of recombinant human CSF-1; and to R. Cotter for preliminary experiments that led to these studies."
https://openalex.org/W2069130980,"Interleukin (IL)-6 plays an important role in a wide range of biological activities, including differentiation of murine M1 myeloid leukemic cells into mature macrophages. At the onset of M1 differentiation, a set of myeloid differentiation primary response (MyD) genes are induced, including the proto-oncogene for JunB. In order to examine the molecular nature of the mechanisms by which IL-6 activates the immediate early expression of MyD genes, JunB was used as a paradigm. A novel IL-6 response element, −65/−52 IL-6RE, to which a 100-kDa protein complex is bound, has been identified on the JunB promoter. Leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF)-induced activation of JunB in M1 cells was also mediated via the −65/−52 IL-6RE. The STAT3 and CRE-like binding sites of the JunB promoter, identified as IL-6-responsive elements in HepG2 liver cells were found, however, to play no role in JunB inducibility by IL-6 in M1 myeloid cells. Conversely, the −65/−52 IL-6RE is shown not to be necessary for JunB inducibility by IL-6 or LIF in liver cells. It appears, therefore, that immediate early activation of JunB is regulated differently in M1 myeloid cells than in HepG2 liver cells. This indicates that distinct cis-acting control elements participate in cell type-specific induction of JunB by members of the IL-6 cytokine superfamily. Interleukin (IL)-6 plays an important role in a wide range of biological activities, including differentiation of murine M1 myeloid leukemic cells into mature macrophages. At the onset of M1 differentiation, a set of myeloid differentiation primary response (MyD) genes are induced, including the proto-oncogene for JunB. In order to examine the molecular nature of the mechanisms by which IL-6 activates the immediate early expression of MyD genes, JunB was used as a paradigm. A novel IL-6 response element, −65/−52 IL-6RE, to which a 100-kDa protein complex is bound, has been identified on the JunB promoter. Leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF)-induced activation of JunB in M1 cells was also mediated via the −65/−52 IL-6RE. The STAT3 and CRE-like binding sites of the JunB promoter, identified as IL-6-responsive elements in HepG2 liver cells were found, however, to play no role in JunB inducibility by IL-6 in M1 myeloid cells.

This indicates that distinct cis-acting control elements participate in cell type-specific induction of JunB by members of the IL-6 cytokine superfamily. Toward dissecting the regulation of normal terminal differentiation and alterations in these regulatory processes that block differentiation, leading to leukemogenicity and its progression, our laboratory has isolated and characterized myeloid differentiation primary response (MyD) genes.

Sequence and expression analysis of MyD genes has led to the conclusion that the immediate early genetic response of myeloid cells to differentiation and growth inhibitory stimuli is complex. This complex response encompassed both known genes, including those for JunB, c-Jun, JunD, IRF-1, Egr-1, H3.3, H10, and ICAM-1, previously identified in the context of other biological systems, and novel genes, including those for MyD118, MyD116, and MyD88 (1Lord K.A.

One approach to address this issue was to study the regulation of promoter elements of MyD genes that mediate the immediate early IL-6 response. Toward this end, JunB was chosen as a paradigm to investigate IL-6-mediated activation of MyD genes, because JunB is highly and stably induced by IL-6 and lacks any introns, which facilitated cloning of its promoter region. Here we report the identification and characterization of a novel cis-acting response element, which is essential for conferring IL-6 and LIF induction of JunB in M1 myeloid cells, but not in HepG2 hepatoma cells.DISCUSSIONJunB was identified as a MyD gene that is stably and highly activated in the absence of de novo protein synthesis upon IL-6/LIF-mediated differentiation of M1 myeloid leukemic cells. Thus, JunB provided an excellent paradigm for the elucidation of the molecular mechanisms that result in immediate early induction of MyD genes by members of the IL-6 superfamily of multifunctional cytokines upon induction of myeloid differentiation. Toward this end, in this work we have identified and characterized cis-regulatory elements in the JunB promoter that are responsive to IL-6/LIF signaling in M1 myeloid cells.The data presented provide evidence for a novel IL-6 response element, −65/−52 IL-6RE, that is necessary and sufficient for the IL-6-induced activation of JunB in M1 myeloid cells. This element also was found to be required for JunB induction by LIF, another member of the IL-6 superfamily, thereby extending our previous findings that LIF and IL-6 activate a common signaling cascade, leading to a similar immediate early MyD response upon induction of myeloid differentiation (5Lord K.A.

Interestingly, we have found that the STAT3 and CRE-like binding sites of the JunB promoter, identified as IL-6 responsiveness elements in HepG2 liver cells (12Nakajima K. Kusafuka T. Takeda T. Fujitani Y. Nakae K. Hirano T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3027-3041Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), do not play a role in JunB inducibility by IL-6 in M1 myeloid cells. Conversely, the −65/−52 IL-6RE was shown not to be necessary for JunB induction by IL-6 or LIF in liver cells. It appears, therefore, that immediate early activation of JunB is regulated differently in M1 myeloid cells than in HepG2 liver cells, suggesting that distinct cis-acting control elements are required for cell type-specific induction of JunB by members of the IL-6 superfamily (Fig. 9).The −65/−52 IL-6RE contains two DNA motifs, a CAAT box located at the 5′ end of the −65/−52 IL-6RE, and the IR element located at the at the 3′ end of the −65/−52 IL-6RE (15de Groot R.P. Auwerx J. Karperien M. Staels B. Kruijer W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 775-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The IR element, located between sequences −57 and −50, was originally identified as an element that could confer phorbol ester and protein kinase A responsiveness in mouse hepatoma BW1 cells (15de Groot R.P. Auwerx J. Karperien M. Staels B. Kruijer W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 775-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). It is unlikely that the IR element plays a role in the IL-6 inducibility of JunB in M1 cells because (i) linker scanning mutants −57/−48 and −55/−45, in which this entire region was mutated, did not show loss of IL-6 inducibility; and (ii) in M1 cells the IL-6 signaling cascade is distinct from TPA and PKA signaling pathways, and no JunB induction was observed following TPA and PKA treatment of M1 cells (5Lord K.A. Abdollahi A. Thomas S.M. DeMarco M. Brugge J.S. Hoffman- Liebermann B. Liebermann D.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 4371-4379Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Therefore, it seems likely that the CAAT box is important for IL-6 inducibility of JunB in M1 myeloid cells. A GC-rich area, located between sequences −97 and −81, which provides potential binding sites for several transcriptional activators such as Egr-1 and Sp-1, does not play a role in the IL-6 inducibility of JunB (data not shown). This suggests that these transcription factors are not involved in IL-6 responsiveness of JunB in M1 cells.We have shown through EMSA and Southwestern analyses that a specific 100-kDa protein complex is constitutively bound to the −65/−52 IL-6RE in M1 cells before and after IL-6 stimulation. Since JunB is an immediate-early response gene, and, therefore, does not require de novo protein synthesis for induction of its mRNA, posttranslational processes would be expected to be involved in its regulation. Therefore, the complex that binds to the −65/−52 IL-6RE is probably in an inactive state, but following IL-6 stimulation is post-translationally modified, possibly through phosphorylation, to activate JunB transcription. Since the genetic mutagenesis analyses have revealed that this element does not play a role in HepG2 cells, it is likely that this factor, although present, is not post-translationally modified by IL-6 in these cells, and, therefore, is not responsible for JunB transcription. The IL-6/LIF signaling cascade, which is mediated via gp130, activates two distinct signaling pathways. One is the JAK-STAT pathway, which results in STAT3 activation. The other one is the activation of the RAS-mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway. In light of our findings, it is tempting to speculate that some kind of tissue specificity is intrinsic to these distinct signaling pathways. Accordingly, in HepG2 liver cells IL-6-induced JunB expression is mediated via the STAT3/STAT3-CRE complex of the JunB promoter via the JAK-STAT signaling cascade, whereas in M1 myeloid cells a different pathway is utilized, perhaps the RAS-mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway, which activates the 100-kDa/IL6-RE complex of the JunB promoter. To test this interesting conjecture, characterization of the 100-kDa/IL-6RE complex and the signaling pathways which result in its activation is under way.As shown in Fig. 10, many MyD genes, which are coordinately activated by IL-6/LIF, were also found to contain an IL-6/LIF-RE-like element, with a CCAAT motif, in their promoter regions. This suggests that the mechanism by which IL-6/LIF activates JunB expression, also operates to activate other MyD genes. Consistent with this notion, EMSA assays using synthetic oligonucleotides corresponding to IL-6/LIF response elements in the promoter regions of other MyD genes (Fig. 10) in conjunction with Southwestern analyses, have shown that the 100-kDa protein complex is bound also to IL-6REs of other MyD genes. 2R.

Med. 1990; 195: 183-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In hematopoiesis, IL-6 and LIF are involved in M1 macrophage differentiation, maturation of megakaryotes, and the enhancement of IL-3 dependent colony formation of primitive blast colony-forming cells (28Hirano T. Chem. Immunol. 1992; 51: 153-180Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, IL-6 and LIF also have been shown to be growth factors for myeloma and plasmacytoma cells (29Zhang X.G. Gu J.J. Lu Z.Y.

A defect in hematopoiesis in Fanconi anemia may be due to a deficiency in IL-6 production (30Rosselli F. Sanceau J. Wietzerbin J. Moustacchi E. Hum. Genet. 1992; 89: 42-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). On the other hand, IL-6 and LIF also play a major role in the synthesis of the acute phase proteins in response to injury and inflammation, such as the induction of fibrinogen, α1-antichymotrypsin, α1-acid glycoprotein, and haptoglobin, in the HepG2 and H35 hepatoma cell lines (23Baumann H. Wong G.G. J. Immunol. 1989; 143: 1163-1167PubMed Google Scholar, 31Baumann H. Won K.A. Jahreis G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8046-8051Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, IL-6/LIF play a wide range of roles in the defense mechanisms, the immune response, hematopoiesis and acute phase reactions. In order for IL-6 and LIF to exert their multifunctional properties in different cell systems, they must activate distinct signaling pathways, leading to the regulation of different regulators, resulting in different IL-6/LIF responses. The data presented in this work provide first evidence for this notion. Extending these observations to other cell lines where JunB is an immediate early target of IL-6/LIF signaling, elucidating the signaling cascade involved, and the trans-acting factors they act on should aid in determining the scope of tissue versatility in IL-6/LIF signaling. Furthermore, these lines of investigation should provide an understanding of the molecular mechanisms by which IL-6/LIF produces both favorable and unfavorable effects on human health and may allow the development of new therapeutic strategies.

Consistent with this notion, EMSA assays using synthetic oligonucleotides corresponding to IL-6/LIF response elements in the promoter regions of other MyD genes (Fig. 10) in conjunction with Southwestern analyses, have shown that the 100-kDa protein complex is bound also to IL-6REs of other MyD genes. 2R. M. Tjin Tham Sjin, B. Hoffman, and D. A. Liebermann, unpublished data. IL-6 and LIF are multifunctional cytokines that have been implicated in both healthy and diseased states (26Sehgal P.B. Wang L. Rayanade R. Pan H. Margulies L. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1995; 762: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 27Sehgal P.B. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1990; 195: 183-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In hematopoiesis, IL-6 and LIF are involved in M1 macrophage differentiation, maturation of megakaryotes, and the enhancement of IL-3 dependent colony formation of primitive blast colony-forming cells (28Hirano T. Chem. Immunol. 1992; 51: 153-180Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, IL-6 and LIF also have been shown to be growth factors for myeloma and plasmacytoma cells (29Zhang X.G. Gu J.J. Lu Z.Y. Yasukawa K. Yancopoulos G.D. Turner K. Shoyab M. Taga T. Kishimoto T. Bataille R. Klein B. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 179: 1337-1342Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). A defect in hematopoiesis in Fanconi anemia may be due to a deficiency in IL-6 production (30Rosselli F. Sanceau J. Wietzerbin J. Moustacchi E. Hum. Genet. 1992; 89: 42-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). On the other hand, IL-6 and LIF also play a major role in the synthesis of the acute phase proteins in response to injury and inflammation, such as the induction of fibrinogen, α1-antichymotrypsin, α1-acid glycoprotein, and haptoglobin, in the HepG2 and H35 hepatoma cell lines (23Baumann H. Wong G.G. J. Immunol. 1989; 143: 1163-1167PubMed Google Scholar, 31Baumann H. Won K.A. Jahreis G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8046-8051Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, IL-6/LIF play a wide range of roles in the defense mechanisms, the immune response, hematopoiesis and acute phase reactions. In order for IL-6 and LIF to exert their multifunctional properties in different cell systems, they must activate distinct signaling pathways, leading to the regulation of different regulators, resulting in different IL-6/LIF responses. The data presented in this work provide first evidence for this notion. Extending these observations to other cell lines where JunB is an immediate early target of IL-6/LIF signaling, elucidating the signaling cascade involved, and the trans-acting factors they act on should aid in determining the scope of tissue versatility in IL-6/LIF signaling. Furthermore, these lines of investigation should provide an understanding of the molecular mechanisms by which IL-6/LIF produces both favorable and unfavorable effects on human health and may allow the development of new therapeutic strategies. JunB was identified as a MyD gene that is stably and highly activated in the absence of de novo protein synthesis upon IL-6/LIF-mediated differentiation of M1 myeloid leukemic cells. Thus, JunB provided an excellent paradigm for the elucidation of the molecular mechanisms that result in immediate early induction of MyD genes by members of the IL-6 superfamily of multifunctional cytokines upon induction of myeloid differentiation. Toward this end, in this work we have identified and characterized cis-regulatory elements in the JunB promoter that are responsive to IL-6/LIF signaling in M1 myeloid cells. The data presented provide evidence for a novel IL-6 response element, −65/−52 IL-6RE, that is necessary and sufficient for the IL-6-induced activation of JunB in M1 myeloid cells. This element also was found to be required for JunB induction by LIF, another member of the IL-6 superfamily, thereby extending our previous findings that LIF and IL-6 activate a common signaling cascade, leading to a similar immediate early MyD response upon induction of myeloid differentiation (5Lord K.A. Abdollahi A. Thomas S.M. DeMarco M. Brugge J.S. Hoffman- Liebermann B. Liebermann D.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 4371-4379Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Interestingly, we have found that the STAT3 and CRE-like binding sites of the JunB promoter, identified as IL-6 responsiveness elements in HepG2 liver cells (12Nakajima K. Kusafuka T. Takeda T. Fujitani Y. Nakae K. Hirano T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3027-3041Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), do not play a role in JunB inducibility by IL-6 in M1 myeloid cells. Conversely, the −65/−52 IL-6RE was shown not to be necessary for JunB induction by IL-6 or LIF in liver cells. It appears, therefore, that immediate early activation of JunB is regulated differently in M1 myeloid cells than in HepG2 liver cells, suggesting that distinct cis-acting control elements are required for cell type-specific induction of JunB by members of the IL-6 superfamily (Fig. 9). The −65/−52 IL-6RE contains two DNA motifs, a CAAT box located at the 5′ end of the −65/−52 IL-6RE, and the IR element located at the at the 3′ end of the −65/−52 IL-6RE (15de Groot R.P. Auwerx J. Karperien M. Staels B. Kruijer W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 775-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The IR element, located between sequences −57 and −50, was originally identified as an element that could confer phorbol ester and protein kinase A responsiveness in mouse hepatoma BW1 cells (15de Groot R.P. Auwerx J. Karperien M. Staels B. Kruijer W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 775-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). It is unlikely that the IR element plays a role in the IL-6 inducibility of JunB in M1 cells because (i) linker scanning mutants −57/−48 and −55/−45, in which this entire region was mutated, did not show loss of IL-6 inducibility; and (ii) in M1 cells the IL-6 signaling cascade is distinct from TPA and PKA signaling pathways, and no JunB induction was observed following TPA and PKA treatment of M1 cells (5Lord K.A. Abdollahi A. Thomas S.M. DeMarco M. Brugge J.S. Hoffman- Liebermann B. Liebermann D.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 4371-4379Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Therefore, it seems likely that the CAAT box is important for IL-6 inducibility of JunB in M1 myeloid cells. A GC-rich area, located between sequences −97 and −81, which provides potential binding sites for several transcriptional activators such as Egr-1 and Sp-1, does not play a role in the IL-6 inducibility of JunB (data not shown). This suggests that these transcription factors are not involved in IL-6 responsiveness of JunB in M1 cells. We have shown through EMSA and Southwestern analyses that a specific 100-kDa protein complex is constitutively bound to the −65/−52 IL-6RE in M1 cells before and after IL-6 stimulation. Since JunB is an immediate-early response gene, and, therefore, does not require de novo protein synthesis for induction of its mRNA, posttranslational processes would be expected to be involved in its regulation. Therefore, the complex that binds to the −65/−52 IL-6RE is probably in an inactive state, but following IL-6 stimulation is post-translationally modified, possibly through phosphorylation, to activate JunB transcription. Since the genetic mutagenesis analyses have revealed that this element does not play a role in HepG2 cells, it is likely that this factor, although present, is not post-translationally modified by IL-6 in these cells, and, therefore, is not responsible for JunB transcription. The IL-6/LIF signaling cascade, which is mediated via gp130, activates two distinct signaling pathways. One is the JAK-STAT pathway, which results in STAT3 activation. The other one is the activation of the RAS-mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway. In light of our findings, it is tempting to speculate that some kind of tissue specificity is intrinsic to these distinct signaling pathways. Accordingly, in HepG2 liver cells IL-6-induced JunB expression is mediated via the STAT3/STAT3-CRE complex of the JunB promoter via the JAK-STAT signaling cascade, whereas in M1 myeloid cells a different pathway is utilized, perhaps the RAS-mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway, which activates the 100-kDa/IL6-RE complex of the JunB promoter. To test this interesting conjecture, characterization of the 100-kDa/IL-6RE complex and the signaling pathways which result in its activation is under way. As shown in Fig. 10, many MyD genes, which are coordinately activated by IL-6/LIF, were also found to contain an IL-6/LIF-RE-like element, with a CCAAT motif, in their promoter regions. This suggests that the mechanism by which IL-6/LIF activates JunB expression, also operates to activate other MyD genes. Consistent with this notion, EMSA assays using synthetic oligonucleotides corresponding to IL-6/LIF response elements in the promoter regions of other MyD genes (Fig. 10) in conjunction with Southwestern analyses, have shown that the 100-kDa protein complex is bound also to IL-6REs of other MyD genes. 2R.

https://openalex.org/W2333532964,"p27Kip1 plays an important role in cell cycle progression by negatively regulating the activity of cyclin-Cdk complexes. To understand how p27Kip1 functions, the level and subcellular location of p27Kip1 in Swiss/3T3 cells following serum stimulation of quiescent cells was examined. Surprisingly, p27Kip1 was observed exclusively in the cytosol throughout G1 and into early S phase. However, as expected, p27Kip1 in the cytosolic fraction was greatly reduced following serum stimulation and reached very low levels by late G1. The decline in the level of p27Kip1 corresponded in time to an increase in the nuclear level of both Cdk2 and cyclin E. In quiescent 3T3 cells Cdk2 was inactive and co-precipitated with p27Kip1. After serum stimulation, both nuclear and cytosolic Cdk2 was activated and this corresponded to the decline in p27Kip1. Overexpression of p27Kip1 allowed accumulation of the inhibitor in the nucleus but inhibited entry of Cdk2 into the nucleus following serum stimulation. The subcellular localization of p27Kip1 was also examined in a variety of other mammalian cells. In all the cell lines examined the preponderance of p27Kip1 was found in the cytosolic fraction. However, a substantial level of nuclear p27Kip1 was observed for several cell lines. In a primary mixed glial cell culture p27Kip1 was localized to the nucleus. The results suggest that cytosolic p27Kip1 has a functional role in regulating cell cycle progression, possibly through inhibiting transport of cyclin E-Cdk 2 complexes into the nucleus."
https://openalex.org/W2324610776,"Transgenic mice which express the simian virus 40 large T-antigen (Tag) under the regulatory control of the hormone responsive rat C3(1) gene develop unusual lesions of heterotopic bone growth associated with mixed tumor formation arising from eccrine sweat glands found only in the foot pads of mice, ischiocavernosus muscle adjacent to bulbourethral glands and occasionally the salivary and mammary glands. These lesions are very similar to mixed tumors arising in several types of human cancers. Based upon electron microscopic examination and immunocytochemical analyses of cellular differentiation markers, the mixed proliferative lesions in this transgenic mouse model begin with the Tag-induced proliferation of epithelial and myoepithelial cells. The proliferation of these two types of cells results in hyperplasia and adenomatous transformation of the epithelial component, whereas the proliferating myoepithelial cells undergo metaplasia to form chondrocytes which deposit extracellular matrix, including collagen fibers. Cartilage develops focally between areas of epithelial proliferation and subsequently ossifies through a process of endochondrial bone formation. The metaplasia of myoepithelial cells to chondrocytes appears to require the inductive interaction of factors produced by the closely associated proliferating epithelial cells, including members of the TGF-beta superfamily. We demonstrate that TGF-beta1 protein accumulates in the extracellular matrix of the lesions, whereas RNA in situ hybridization reveals that BMP-2, another strong inducer of heterotopic bone formation, is overexpressed by the proliferating epithelial cells during the development of ectopic bone. The formation of sarcomatous tumors within the mixed tumors appears to be androgen-dependent and more frequent in mice lacking a normal allele of p53. This process of cartilage and bone induction may mimic epithelial-mesenchymal interactions which occur during embryonic bone formation. These transgenic mice may provide new insights into the processes of ectopic endochondrial bone formation associated with mixed tumor formation and serve as a useful model for human heterotopic bone disease."
https://openalex.org/W2043143251,"Tay-Sachs disease is an inborn lysosomal disease characterized by excessive cerebral accumulation of GM2. The catabolism of GM2 to GM3 in man requires β-hexosaminidase A (HexA) and a protein cofactor, the GM2 activator. Thus, Tay-Sachs disease can be caused by the deficiency of either HexA or the GM2 activator. The same cofactor found in mouse shares 74.1% amino acid identity (67% nucleotide identity) with the human counterpart. Between the two activators, the mouse GM2 activator can effectively stimulate the hydrolysis of both GM2 and asialo-GM2 (GA2) by HexA and, to a lesser extent, also stimulate HexB to hydrolyze GA2, whereas the human activator is ineffective in stimulating the hydrolysis of GA2 (Yuziuk, J. A., Bertoni, C., Beccari, T., Orlacchio, A., Wu, Y.-Y., Li, S.-C., and Li, Y.-T. (1998) J. Biol. Chem. 273, 66–72). To understand the role of these two activators in stimulating the hydrolyses of GM2 and GA2, we have constructed human/mouse chimeric GM2 activators and studied their specificities. We have identified a narrow region (Asn106–Tyr114) in the mouse cDNA sequence that might be responsible for stimulating the hydrolysis of GA2. Replacement of the corresponding site in the human sequence with the specific mouse sequence converted the ineffective human activator into an effective chimeric protein for stimulating the hydrolysis of GA2. This chimeric activator protein, like the mouse protein, is also able to stimulate the hydrolysis of GA2 by HexB. The mouse model of human type B Tay-Sachs disease recently engineered by the targeted disruption of the Hexa gene showed less severe clinical manifestation than found in human patients. This has been considered to be the result of the catabolism of GM2 via converting it to GA2 and further hydrolysis of GA2 to lactosylceramide by HexB with the assistance of mouse GM2 activator protein. The chimeric activator protein that bears the characteristics of the mouse GM2 activator may therefore be able to induce an alternative catabolic pathway for GM2 in human type B Tay-Sachs patients.

In contrast, we have shown that the highly purified mouse HexB was not able to convert GM2 to GM3, but was able to slowly catalyze the conversion of GA2 to LacCer in the presence of the mouse GM2 activator (mM2act) (9Yuziuk J.A.

The numbering system for the deduced amino acids in the following constructs was based on the alignment of the nucleotide sequences of hM2act and mM2act using the PC/GENE computer software program (Fig. 1). Three gaps in the human sequence and seven gaps in the mouse sequence were inserted to obtain the best alignment. Therefore, the numerical assignment for the amino acids in the human sequence differed from that in the mouse sequence by a factor of +4 amino acids. All the gaps inserted were contained within the first 27 amino acids of the human sequence at the propeptide region, which is removed by proteolysis during the maturation of GM2 activator protein (13Fürst W.

The upstream primer was 5′-TAA-TAC-GAC-TCA-CTA-TAG-GGA-GA-3′ (T7 primer) within the pT7 vector region, and the downstream primer (noncoding) was 5′-GAG-TAG-GTA-CCT-TCT-TTG-3′ with a built-inKpnI restriction site (underlined). This cDNA segment was digested with BamHI and KpnI. The remaining 164-bp cDNA fragment encoding mouse exon 4 was obtained by restriction digestion of pMact with KpnI andHindIII. The two cDNA segments were subcloned into the pT7-7 expression vector at BamHI and HindIII sites. This construct contains human exon 2 and mouse exons 3 and 4. A 177-bp DNA fragment encoding the 9 amino acids of the pT7-7 expression vector plus the first 50 amino acids (Ser32–Lys81) of the mature hM2act sequence (13Fürst W. Schubert J. Machleidt W. Meyer H.E. Sandhoff K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 192: 709-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) encoded by exon 2 of the human sequence (also see Fig. 1) was generated by PCR amplification using p513 as template. The upstream primer was the T7 primer as described above. The downstream primer (noncoding) was 5′-ACG-GTG-AGC-TCC-ACC-TTC-3′, which contained aSacI restriction site (underlined). The remaining 112 amino acids encoded by mouse exons 3 and 4 were obtained by restriction digestion of the mM2act cDNA (pMact) (9Yuziuk J.A. Bertoni C. Beccari T. Orlacchio A. Wu Y.-Y Li S.-C. Li Y.-T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 66-72Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) with SacI andHindIII to yield a 344-bp cDNA fragment encoding Val78–Arg189 of mM2act. This mouse cDNA segment and the above PCR fragment of human exon 2, which had been digested with BamHI and SacI, were subcloned into a pT7-7 expression vector at BamHI and HindIII sites. This construct contains human exon 2, mouse exon 3, and human exon 4. The cDNAs encoding human exon 2 and mouse exon 3 were obtained by restriction digestion of the construct ph2m3m4using KpnI and HindIII to generate the ph2m3 fragment. The remaining cDNA of the 164-bp fragment encoding human exon 4 was generated by PCR using p513 as template. The upstream primer was 5′-GAA-GGT-ACC-TAC-TCA-3′, in which the KpnI site is underlined. The downstream noncoding primer was the T7-7 primer 5′-GAT-GAT-AAG-CTT-GGG-CTG-3′, corresponding to the 3′-untranslated region of the pT7-7 vector. The amplified human fragment (207 bp) was digested with KpnI and HindIII and ligated into ph2m3 at KpnI and HindIII sites. This construct contains mouse exons 2 and 3 plus human exon 4. The construct ph2m3h4 was digested withPvuII and HindIII to yield the 324-bp cDNA fragment encoding Ser103–Glu138 of the mouse sequence followed by the h4 segment. This fragment was subcloned into mouse pMact that had been digested by PvuII and HindIII. From the initial experiments, the m3 segment appeared to be important for eliciting the stimulatory activity for the enzymatic hydrolysis of GA2. Therefore, we subsequently modified the m3 segment in ph2m3h4by including more human sequence and generated the following constructs (also see Fig. 2 B). This construct contains an extended human sequence (25 amino acids from Val82 to Cys106) at the N terminus of m3. The 226-bp fragment encoding Ser32–Cys106 of hM2act was excised from p513 by restriction digestion with BamHI and PvuII. The segment of mouse exon 3 encoding Ser103–Glu138 plus human exon 4 encoding Gly143-Ile193 was obtained by digestion of ph2m3h4 with PvuII andHindIII. The two fragments were ligated into the pT7-7 vector at its BamHI and HindIII sites. This construct contains an extended human sequence (36 amino acids from Thr107 to Glu142) at the C terminus of m3. The 323-bp cDNA fragment encoding Thr107–Ile193 of the human sequence was generated by PCR using p513 as template. The upstream primer was 5′-GGC-AGC-TGT-ACC-TTT-GAA-3′, containing aPvuII restriction site (underlined); and the downstream primer was the T7-7 primer as described above. The PCR product was digested with PvuII and HindIII and subcloned into ph2m3h4 that had been cut byPvuII and HindIII. This construct contains an extended human sequence from both ends of m3 and keeps only Ser103–Pro117 in the mouse sequence. The p513 clone was used as template to generate, by PCR, a cDNA fragment covering Thr121–Ile193 of hM2act. The upstream primer was 5′-CCT-CCC-GGG-GAG-CCC-TGC-3′, containing a point mutation in the Thr121 codon to give Pro117 of mM2act and also to generate a SmaI restriction site (underlined). The T7-7 primer as described above was used as the downstream noncoding primer. This fragment was digested usingSmaI and HindIII. Another 374-bp cDNA fragment encoding Ser32–Cys106 of the human sequence followed by Ser103–Pro116 of the mouse sequence was generated from the ph2m3h4-a clone by PCR. The upstream primer was the T7 primer as described above, and the downstream noncoding primer was 5′-GCT-CTC-CCC-GGG-AGG-AAT-3′, in which the SmaI restriction site is underlined. This fragment was digested withBamHI and SmaI. Then, both cDNA fragments were inserted at the BamHI and HindIII sites of the pT7-7 vector. This construct contains an additional extension of 7 amino acids (Thr107–Asp113) of the human sequence in ph2m3h4-a-SH, leaving only Leu110–Pro117 in the mouse sequence. The p513 clone was used as template to generate a cDNA fragment by PCR to span from Thr107 to Ile193 of the human sequence. The upstream primer was 5′-GGC-AGC-TGT-ACC-TTT-GAA-CAC-TTC-TGT-GAC-CTG-ATA-GAC-GAA-TAC-ATT-3′ with a built-in PvuII site (underlined), and the T7-7 primer described above was used as the downstream noncoding primer. Nine point mutations (indicated in boldface) were introduced into the upstream primer to generate the fragment encoding Leu110, Ile111, Glu113, Tyr114, and Pro117 of the mouse sequence. The amplified cDNA fragment was digested with PvuII and HindIII and subcloned into p513 at the corresponding restriction site. This construct contains the human sequence from Ser32 to Asp113 followed by the mouse sequence from Leu110 to Arg189. The portion from Ser32 to Asp113 of the human sequence plus Leu110–Pro117 of the mouse sequence was generated by digestion of ph2m3h4-a-NI with BamHI and SmaI. This cDNA fragment was subcloned into mouse pMact that was digested with BamHI and SmaI. Since ph2m3h4-a-SH contains only 5 amino acids (Asn106, Ile107, Glu113, Tyr114, and Pro117) that are different from the human sequence, the following constructs were prepared to evaluate the importance of these amino acids (see Fig.6). This construct is basically the human sequence except with the changes of Met117 and Leu118to Glu113 and Tyr114, respectively, to match the mouse sequence. The upstream primer 5′-GGC-AGC-TGT-ACC-TTT-GAA-CAC-TTC-TGT-GAT-GTG-CTT-GAC-GAA-TAC-ATT-3′ with a built-in PvuII site (underlined) was used along with the T7-7 primer described above to generate, by PCR, the cDNA encoding the amino acid sequence from Thr107 to Ile193 of the human sequence. The p513 clone served as template. The five point mutations in the upstream primer (indicated in boldface) were introduced to create the replacement of human Met117 and Leu118 with Glu113 and Tyr114, respectively, at the corresponding positions of the mouse sequence. The amplified fragment was digested withPvuII and HindIII and subcloned into the p513 clone at its equivalent restriction site. This construct is essentially the same as p513ML with an additional change of Thr121 of the human sequence to Pro117 at the corresponding position of the mouse sequence. The primers used to generate p513ML were also used to construct p513MLT. However, the template for PCR was ph2m3h4-a-NI instead of p513. This construct contains the human sequence except with the replacement of 5 amino acids with the corresponding Asn106, Ile107, Glu113, Tyr114, and Pro117 from the mouse sequence. p513MLT was used as template to generate a cDNA fragment by PCR. The upstream primer was 5′-GGC-AGC-TGT-ACC-TTT-GAA-AAC-ATC-TGT-3′ with a built-in PvuII site (underlined). Two point mutations (indicated in boldface) were introduced to provide Asn106and Ile107 of the mouse sequence. The noncoding downstream primer was the T7-7 primer as described above. The PCR product was digested with PvuII and HindIII and subcloned into p513 at its corresponding restriction sites. Each construct was verified by sequencing the cDNA prior to transforming the competent E. coli BL21(DE3) cells. TheE. coli transformants were inoculated into 150 ml of LB medium containing 1 mg/ml ampicillin and incubated overnight at 37 °C. The overnight culture was diluted at a ratio of 1:33 with fresh LB/ampicillin medium (30 ml/1 liter) and grown for ∼4 h at 37 °C. Expression of GM2 activator protein was then induced by addition of isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at a final concentration of 1 mm, and the culture was grown for an additional 6 h. The cells were harvested by centrifugation at 6000 rpm for 15 min using a GS3 rotor in a Sorvall RC5C centrifuge. Expression, refolding, and purification of the human/mouse GM2 activator chimeras were carried out as described previously for the refolding of hM2act (14Wu Y.-Y. Lockyer J.M. Sugiyama E. Pavlova N.V. Li Y.-T. Li S.-C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16276-16283Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Human HexA activity was determined using fluorogenic substrates (4-methylumbelliferyl N-acetylglucosaminide and 4-methylumbelliferyl N-acetylglucosaminide 6-sulfate) according to Potier et al. (15Potier M. Mameli L. Bélisle M. Dallaire L. Melançon S.B. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 94: 287-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (735) Google Scholar). An appropriate amount of HexA was incubated with 1.5 mm 4-methylumbelliferylN-acetylglucosaminide or 4-methylumbelliferylN-acetylglucosaminide 6-sulfate in 50 mm sodium citrate buffer (pH 5.0) in a total volume of 50 μl at 37 °C. After a preset time, 1.5 ml of 0.2 m sodium borate buffer (pH 9.8) was added to stop the reaction. The released 4-methylumbelliferone was determined using a Sequoia-Turner Model 450 fluorometer. One unit of enzyme activity is defined as the amount that liberates 1 μmol of 4-methylumbelliferone/min at 37 °C. This fluorogenic assay was used only to standardize the amount of HexA for each experiment. For the hydrolysis of GM2 and GA2, the reaction mixture contained 3 nmol of substrate in 40 μl of 10 mm sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.0). The reactions were initiated by adding 20 milliunits of human HexA and terminated by adding 40 μl of ethanol. The mixtures were dried under vacuum using a SpeedVac, redissolved in 20 μl of chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v), and applied to a TLC plate. The plate was developed with chloroform/methanol/water (60:35:8, v/v/v), sprayed with diphenylamine reagent (16Harris G. MacWilliams I.C. Chem. Ind. (Lond.). 1954; : 249Google Scholar), and heated at 115 °C for 15–20 min to visualize the glycolipids. The quantitative analysis of the glycolipid bands on the TLC plate was carried out using a Scan Jet 2C/ADF scanner (Hewlett-Packard Co.) and the NIH Image 1.41 program. The recombinant human/mouse chimeric GM2 activators were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis using 15% gel (17Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar). Proteins were electrophoretically transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane in 20 mm Tris and 150 mm glycine buffer (pH 8.0) containing 20% methanol at 70 V for 1 h using a Bio-Rad transfer apparatus. The nitrocellulose membrane was first soaked with 1% milk powder and then overlaid with rabbit anti-hM2act antibodies (1:1500) (18Li S.-C. Hirabayashi Y. Li Y.-T. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 6234-6240Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or rabbit anti-mM2act antibodies (produced by Cocalico Biological, Inc.) as the primary antibody followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:2000) as the secondary antibody. The membrane was then developed in 3.4 mm 4-chloro-1-naphthol containing 0.01% hydrogen peroxide to produce purple bands. The nucleotide sequences of hM2act and mM2act downstream from the initiation codon were analyzed using the PC/GENE program (Fig.1). With 10 gap insertions in exon 1 (three in the human sequence and seven in the mouse sequence), the two sequences obtained the best alignment and showed 67% identity in their nucleotides. These gaps are upstream of the sequence encoding the mature form of hM2act (13Fürst W. Schubert J. Machleidt W. Meyer H.E. Sandhoff K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 192: 709-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). A higher degree of similarity (74.1% identical and 9.9% similar) was found in the deduced amino acid sequences when they were compared as mature proteins from Ser32 to the C terminus of the human sequence (Fig. 1). The comparison based on the mature protein is appropriate in this study since all the chimeras were expressed only as the mature proteins. Although hM2act and mM2act share a very high degree of homology and both are active in stimulating the enzymatic hydrolysis of GM2, their stimulatory activities for the hydrolysis of GA2 are distinctly different. Fig.3 A shows the time course of GM2 hydrolysis by human HexA in the presence of either hM2act or mM2act. Under the same condition, 1 μg each of hM2act and mM2act showed comparable stimulatory activity for the hydrolysis of GM2 throughout the 10-, 20-, and 30-min incubations. This indicates that these two activator proteins have similar potency in stimulating the hydrolysis of GM2. However, when the hydrolysis of GA2 (Fig.3 B) was examined in the presence of the same amount of each activator as that used in Fig. 3 A, mM2act showed a much more pronounced stimulatory activity than that exerted by hM2act. This result corroborates our previous report (9Yuziuk J.A. Bertoni C. Beccari T. Orlacchio A. Wu Y.-Y Li S.-C. Li Y.-T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 66-72Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) that mM2act was able to effectively stimulate the hydrolysis of GA2 and that hM2act was ineffective in stimulating this reaction. Image scanning of the TLC plate showed that the stimulatory activity of hM2act for GA2 hydrolysis was only ∼15–18% of that of mM2act. Based on this difference, we reasoned that any human/mouse chimeric activator that can elicit stimulatory activity similar to that of mM2act for the hydrolysis of GA2 should be attributed to the specific mouse sequence in the chimeric protein. All chimeras were therefore examined for their stimulatory activities for the hydrolyses of GM2 and GA2 using 1 μg of the protein. Our strategy was to exchange selected parts of the human sequence with the corresponding mouse sequence and to examine the chimeras for their increased ability to stimulate the hydrolysis of GA2. This strategy was proven to be effective. Alternatively, one can start from the mouse sequence and substitute it with certain parts of the human sequence. This strategy would result in chimeras with diminished stimulatory activity for GA2 hydrolysis. Because the stimulatory activity of the activator protein can also be attenuated by factors such as poor protein refolding, the second approach might not provide clear results. Taking advantage of the fact that the cDNAs of hM2act and mM2act share a high degree of homology and identical intron/exon junctions (19Klima H. Tanaka A. Schnabel D. Nakano T. Schröder M. Suzuki K. Sandhoff K. FEBS Lett. 1991; 289: 260-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 20Bertoni C. Apolloni M.G. Stirling J.L. Li S.-C. Li Y.-T. Orlacchio A. Beccari T. Mamm. Genome. 1997; 8: 90-93Crossref Scopus (7) Google Scholar), we first constructed four chimeric constructs (ph2h3m4, ph2m3m4, ph2m3h4, and pm2m3h4) according to the four possible exchanges of exons (Fig. 2). All four proteins expressed by these chimeric constructs were fully active in stimulating the hydrolysis of GM2 (Fig. 4 A,lanes 4–7). These results indicate that the exchange of the corresponding exon segments between the human and mouse sequences did not alter the stimulatory activity of the chimeric proteins for the hydrolysis of GM2. These results were not unexpected since both hM2act and mM2act could effectively stimulate this reaction. We were intrigued, however, by the differences in the ability of these chimeras to stimulate the hydrolysis of GA2 (Fig. 4 B). Under the same incubation conditions, those proteins encoded by ph2m3m4, ph2m3h4, and pm2m3h4, but not that by ph2h3m4, showed significant activity to stimulate the hydrolysis of GA2 (Fig. 4 B,lanes 4–7; also summarized in Fig. 2 A). The protein encoded by ph2h3m4 and the parent hM2act showed on"

In this paper we have demonstrated that: 1) in resting cells phospholipase D (PLD) is implicated in the control of apical protein transit; 2) phorbol esters stimulate apical protein transit (stimulation factor 2.2), which is correlated with a PLD-catalyzed production of phosphatidic acid (PA) (2.45-fold increase); 3) the stimulation of cholinergic receptors by carbachol results in an increase (stimulation factor 1.45) of apical protein transit which is independent of protein kinase C and PLD activities, but related to PA formation (1.7-fold increase) via phospholipase(s) C and diacylglycerol kinase activation; 4) an elevation of the cAMP level enhances apical protein transit by a PA-independent mechanism; 5) a trans-Golgi network or post-trans-Golgi network step of the transit is the target for the regulatory events. In conclusion, we have shown that PA can be produced by two independent signaling pathways; whatever the pathway followed, a close relationship between the amount of PA and the level of secretion was observed.

The protein machinery underlying protein transport from the endoplasmic reticulum to the cell surface has been extensively studied (for a review, see Ref. 1Rothman J.E. Wieland F.T. Science. 1996; 272: 227-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (1021) Google Scholar). However, interest in the regulatory mechanisms that control the different steps of the intracellular traffic and more particularly the role of the lipids in this processes is rapidly growing at the moment.The possible involvement of different signal transduction pathways in the control of intracellular protein transit has recently been investigated; the first evidence indicating that anterograde transport along the secretory pathway is regulated by protein phosphorylation was provided by the use of the phosphatase inhibitor okadaic acid (2Lucocq J.

More recently, Jilling and Kirk (11Jilling T. Kirk K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4381-4387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) showed that, in cultured colonic epithelial cells, cAMP stimulated constitutive membrane traffic from the TGN to the apical cell surface. Muniz et al. (12Muniz M. Alonso M. Hidalgo J. Velasco A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30935-30941Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) demonstrated that, in NRK cells, the inhibition of PKA by the PKA inhibitor H89 decreased protein transit from the ER to the Golgi and blocked the exit of the vesicular stomatitis virus G glycoprotein from the Golgi. In lacrimal glands Robin et al. (13Robin P. Rossignol B. Raymond M.N. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: C262-C271Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) showed that the PKA inhibitor H89 affected the intracellular transit of regulated secretory proteins.As far as a regulatory effect of protein kinase C (PKC) on intracellular traffic is concerned, few data are available. Membrane trafficking between the ER and the Golgi apparatus of NRK cells was found to be regulated by a diacylglycerol/phorbol ester-binding protein (14Fabbri M. Bannykh S. Balch W.E. J. Biol.

Evidence for the participation of phosphoinositides and phosphatidylinositol kinases in the regulation of membrane traffic has been reported (for a review, see Ref. 22De Camilli P. Emr S.D. McPherson P.S. Novick P. Science. 1996; 271: 1533-1539Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar). Lipases are also implicated in these phenomena; as long ago as 1993, Stutchfield and Cockcroft (23Stutchfield J. Cockcroft S. Biochem.

Finally, these cells become polarized after confluence, so when they are grown on filters, basolateral and apical secretions can be analyzed independently.The aim of this study was to investigate in intact cells, which normally secrete proteins, the different pathways controlling protein transit and to determine the nature of the second messenger(s) connecting the signaling events, evoked by the binding of receptor-directed agonists, to protein secretion.In this work we quantified the amounts of α1-antitrypsin, the major protein secreted. We showed that protein transit can be regulated at a TGN or post-TGN step of the pathway and confirmed that agents that increase the cAMP level enhanced apical protein transit. We demonstrated that other mechanisms also controlled secretion: (i) phorbol esters, which we showed to activate PLD, enhanced the PA amount and the apical transit; (ii) carbachol, which we showed to activate PLC and produce an elevation of the PA level (but without activating PLD), also increased apical transit, but to a lower extent.We can conclude that in HT29-cl19A cells, an increase of PA level, either directly by PLD action or by a two-step mechanism involving the action of both PLC and DAG kinase is correlated to an enhancement in the rate of apical protein transit.DISCUSSIONIn this work we present new data concerning the regulation of apical protein transit by several different signaling pathways. Colonic epithelial HT29-cl19A cells, 5–10 days after they have reached confluence, exhibit morphological cell polarity and functional differentiation (28Augeron C. Laboisse C.L. Cancer Res. 1984; 44: 3961-3969PubMed Google Scholar). They secrete in a constitutive way α1-antitrypsin, which represents about 95% of the apically secreted proteins.We showed that phorbol esters reduce the duration of transit and enhance the rate of apical protein transit by 2.2-fold. This increase in protein transit is inhibited by BIM, a PKC inhibitor. Since BIM interacts specifically with the catalytic domain of PKC, we conclude that PKC activity is needed for the regulation of protein transit in HT29-cl19A cells. The requirement of the phosphorylating activity of a Golgi-associated PKC in the vesicle formation and release was described by Westerman et al. (21Westermann P. Knoblich M. Maier O. Lindschau C. Haller H. Biochem. J. 1996; 320: 651-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) and Simon et al. (19Simon J.-P. Ivanov I.E. Shopsin B. Hersh D. Adesnik M. Sabatini D.D. J. Biol.

The possible implication of PLD in the regulation of protein transit in HT29-cl19A was thus investigated. Ethanol was found to reduce unstimulated secretion in a dose-dependent way; moreover, in unstimulated cells incubated in the presence of ethanol, a small amount of PEt was detected, indicating a low basal PLD activity. The suggestion that a basal activity of this enzyme may mediate constitutive secretion was recently put forward by Bi et al. (27Bi K. Roth M.G. Ktistakis N.T. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 301-307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). To confirm the involvement of PLD and PA in protein transit, we determined the amounts of PA (or PEt) in different experimental conditions and observed a close correlation between these results and our data concerning secretion. (i) PDBu increased the amount of PA by 2.45-fold, whereas it stimulated secretion by 2.2-fold; (ii) ethanol decreased the amount of PA by 35%, whereas it lowered secretion by 36%; (iii) BIM inhibited the PDBu-stimulated PLD activity (65% inhibition) to the same degree as it reduced protein release triggered by PDBu (60% inhibition). Nevertheless, about 40% of both PLD activation and protein secretion triggered by phorbol esters bypasses the PKC step, and at present we do not have explanation for this pathway.Taken together our results strongly suggest that, in intact cells, phorbol esters regulate protein transit via PLD-catalyzed PA production. They are in good agreement with the recent findings, obtained from experiments performed with a cell-free system, that PA increases vesicle budding from the TGN (26Siddhanta A. Shields D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17995-17998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar).In this work, phorbol esters were shown to activate PKCs and PLD with a resulting increase in protein transit. However, although these drugs are useful pharmacological tools, they are not physiological modulators of the regulatory pathways. We took advantage of the fact that HT29-cl19A cells possess muscarinic M3 receptors (36Zhang W. Roomans G.M. Cell Struct. Funct. 1997; 22: 379-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar) to study the effect of carbachol, a cholinergic receptor-directed agonist, on protein transit. Activation of these receptors results in the triggering of a well established signal transduction pathway; the activation of a PI-PLC generates IP3, which controls cytosolic Ca2+ levels, and DAG, which is an important regulator for PKC.Carbachol was less efficient than phorbol esters in increasing protein secretion (stimulation factor 1.45 compared with 2.2 obtained with PDBu). Nevertheless, the results obtained with carbachol were rather unexpected. Although carbachol, via PI-PLC activation, was able to produce IP3 (and consequently DAG), (i) Ca2+was not found to be involved in the control of protein transit; (ii) DAG was not found to activate PLD via a PKC activation as it was the case for PDBu (perhaps the PKC isoform(s) activated by DAG is not implicated in PLD stimulation). Another mechanism explaining the secretory effect of carbachol had to be searched. A product derived from DAG may be involved. As DAG can be phosphorylated into PA by a DAG kinase, we analyzed the PA content of the cells and showed that the level of this phospholipid was increased by about 1.7-fold on carbachol stimulation. Thus, carbachol, on the one hand, enhanced the PA level in the cells and, on the other hand, increased protein secretion. These two results are well correlated and strengthen the conclusion that PA plays a role in the regulation of protein transit.DAG (and consequently PA) was also reported to be produced by direct hydrolysis of PC by a PC-PLC; cholinergic and bradykinin receptors have been shown to activate this enzyme (40Diaz-Meco M.T.

In HT29-cl19A cells, we found that D609, a specific inhibitor of this enzyme (42Amtmann E. Drugs Exp. Clin. Res. 1996; XXII: 287-294Google Scholar), partly inhibited the production of PA triggered by carbachol. The two phospholipases may play a role in the physiological regulation of protein transit, as McKenzie et al. (41McKenzie F.R. Seuwen K. Pouysségur J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22759-22769Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) showed that, in fibroblasts treated with carbachol, PI-PLC activation lead to a transient increase in DAG level, whereas PC-PLC activation would produce a sustained level of DAG. Since secretion is a phenomenon that lasts several hours, a sustained PC-PLC-dependent production of PA is not unlikely in our system.Finally we show that PA production is not the sole mechanism controlling secretion, since we demonstrated that cAMP controls protein transit by a PA-independent pathway.Our results allow us to describe a part of the regulation of protein secretion in HT29-cl19A cells according to the scheme presented in Fig.7; the constitutive secretion depends on a basal PLD activity. A phorbol ester-triggered enhancement of the rate of protein transit is well correlated to a classical PLD-catalyzed PA production. Nevertheless, when the cells are stimulated via their cholinergic receptors, the increase in the rate of protein transit, also in good correlation with an enhancement of the amount of PA, implicates a non-classical pathway involving the activation of PLCs and DAG kinase. The protein machinery underlying protein transport from the endoplasmic reticulum to the cell surface has been extensively studied (for a review, see Ref. 1Rothman J.E. Wieland F.T. Science. 1996; 272: 227-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (1021) Google Scholar). However, interest in the regulatory mechanisms that control the different steps of the intracellular traffic and more particularly the role of the lipids in this processes is rapidly growing at the moment. The possible involvement of different signal transduction pathways in the control of intracellular protein transit has recently been investigated; the first evidence indicating that anterograde transport along the secretory pathway is regulated by protein phosphorylation was provided by the use of the phosphatase inhibitor okadaic acid (2Lucocq J.

Evidence for the participation of phosphoinositides and phosphatidylinositol kinases in the regulation of membrane traffic has been reported (for a review, see Ref. 22De Camilli P. Emr S.D. McPherson P.S. Novick P. Science. 1996; 271: 1533-1539Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar). Lipases are also implicated in these phenomena; as long ago as 1993, Stutchfield and Cockcroft (23Stutchfield J. Cockcroft S. Biochem.

As DAG can be phosphorylated into PA by a DAG kinase, we analyzed the PA content of the cells and showed that the level of this phospholipid was increased by about 1.7-fold on carbachol stimulation. Thus, carbachol, on the one hand, enhanced the PA level in the cells and, on the other hand, increased protein secretion. These two results are well correlated and strengthen the conclusion that PA plays a role in the regulation of protein transit.DAG (and consequently PA) was also reported to be produced by direct hydrolysis of PC by a PC-PLC; cholinergic and bradykinin receptors have been shown to activate this enzyme (40Diaz-Meco M.T.

In HT29-cl19A cells, we found that D609, a specific inhibitor of this enzyme (42Amtmann E. Drugs Exp. Clin. Res. 1996; XXII: 287-294Google Scholar), partly inhibited the production of PA triggered by carbachol. The two phospholipases may play a role in the physiological regulation of protein transit, as McKenzie et al. (41McKenzie F.R. Seuwen K. Pouysségur J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22759-22769Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) showed that, in fibroblasts treated with carbachol, PI-PLC activation lead to a transient increase in DAG level, whereas PC-PLC activation would produce a sustained level of DAG. Since secretion is a phenomenon that lasts several hours, a sustained PC-PLC-dependent production of PA is not unlikely in our system.Finally we show that PA production is not the sole mechanism controlling secretion, since we demonstrated that cAMP controls protein transit by a PA-independent pathway.Our results allow us to describe a part of the regulation of protein secretion in HT29-cl19A cells according to the scheme presented in Fig.7; the constitutive secretion depends on a basal PLD activity. A phorbol ester-triggered enhancement of the rate of protein transit is well correlated to a classical PLD-catalyzed PA production. Nevertheless, when the cells are stimulated via their cholinergic receptors, the increase in the rate of protein transit, also in good correlation with an enhancement of the amount of PA, implicates a non-classical pathway involving the activation of PLCs and DAG kinase. In this work we present new data concerning the regulation of apical protein transit by several different signaling pathways. Colonic epithelial HT29-cl19A cells, 5–10 days after they have reached confluence, exhibit morphological cell polarity and functional differentiation (28Augeron C. Laboisse C.L. Cancer Res. 1984; 44: 3961-3969PubMed Google Scholar). They secrete in a constitutive way α1-antitrypsin, which represents about 95% of the apically secreted proteins. We showed that phorbol esters reduce the duration of transit and enhance the rate of apical protein transit by 2.2-fold. This increase in protein transit is inhibited by BIM, a PKC inhibitor. Since BIM interacts specifically with the catalytic domain of PKC, we conclude that PKC activity is needed for the regulation of protein transit in HT29-cl19A cells. The requirement of the phosphorylating activity of a Golgi-associated PKC in the vesicle formation and release was described by Westerman et al. (21Westermann P. Knoblich M. Maier O. Lindschau C. Haller H. Biochem. J. 1996; 320: 651-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) and Simon et al. (19Simon J.-P. Ivanov I.E. Shopsin B. Hersh D. Adesnik M. Sabatini D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16952-16961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar); our experiments in intact cells are in good agreement with these findings from cell-free systems. The hypothesis that PKC could play a role in vesicular transport through the activation of PLD, which has been found to be enriched in Golgi membranes (44Ktistakis N.T. Brown H.A. Sternweis P.C. Roth M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4952-4956Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 45Colley W.C. Sung T.-C. Roll R. Jenco J. Hammond S.M. Altshuller Y. Bar-Sagi D. Morris A.J. Frohman M.A. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 191-201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar) is attractive. The possible implication of PLD in the regulation of protein transit in HT29-cl19A was thus investigated. Ethanol was found to reduce unstimulated secretion in a dose-dependent way; moreover, in unstimulated cells incubated in the presence of ethanol, a small amount of PEt was detected, indicating a low basal PLD activity. The suggestion that a basal activity of this enzyme may mediate constitutive secretion was recently put forward by Bi et al. (27Bi K. Roth M.G. Ktistakis N.T. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 301-307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). To confirm the involvement of PLD and PA in protein transit, we determined the amounts of PA (or PEt) in different experimental conditions and observed a close correlation between these results and our data concerning secretion. (i) PDBu increased the amount of PA by 2.45-fold, whereas it stimulated secretion by 2.2-fold; (ii) ethanol decreased the amount of PA by 35%, whereas it lowered secretion by 36%; (iii) BIM inhibited the PDBu-stimulated PLD activity (65% inhibition) to the same degree as it reduced protein release triggered by PDBu (60% inhibition). Nevertheless, about 40% of both PLD activation and protein secretion triggered by phorbol esters bypasses the PKC step, and at present we do not have explanation for this pathway. Taken together our results strongly suggest that, in intact cells, phorbol esters regulate protein transit via PLD-catalyzed PA production. They are in good agreement with the recent findings, obtained from experiments performed with a cell-free system, that PA increases vesicle budding from the TGN (26Siddhanta A. Shields D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17995-17998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). In this work, phorbol esters were shown to activate PKCs and PLD with a resulting increase in protein transit. However, although these drugs are useful pharmacological tools, they are not physiological modulators of the regulatory pathways. We took advantage of the fact that HT29-cl19A cells possess muscarinic M3 receptors (36Zhang W. Roomans G.M. Cell Struct. Funct. 1997; 22: 379-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar) to study the effect of carbachol, a cholinergic receptor-directed agonist, on protein transit. Activation of these receptors results in the triggering of a well established signal transduction pathway; the activation of a PI-PLC generates IP3, which controls cytosolic Ca2+ levels, and DAG, which is an important regulator for PKC. Carbachol was less efficient than phorbol esters in increasing protein secretion (stimulation factor 1.45 compared with 2.2 obtained with PDBu). Nevertheless, the results obtained with carbachol were rather unexpected. Although carbachol, via PI-PLC activation, was able to produce IP3 (and consequently DAG), (i) Ca2+was not found to be involved in the control of protein transit; (ii) DAG was not found to activate PLD via a PKC activation as it was the case for PDBu (perhaps the PKC isoform(s) activated by DAG is not implicated in PLD stimulation).

https://openalex.org/W2067946755,"Global brain ischemia causes cell death in the CA1 region of the hippocampus 3–5 days after reperfusion. The biological pathway leading to such delayed neuronal damage has not been established. By using differential display analysis, we examined expression levels of poly(A) RNAs isolated from hippocampal extracts prepared from rats exposed to global ischemia and found an up-regulated transcript, clone 17a. Northern blot analysis of clone 17a showed an approximately 35-fold increase in the ischemic brain at 24 h after four-vessel occlusion. Rapid amplification of cDNA ends of clone 17a revealed a family of genes (160–540 base pairs) that had the characteristics of rodent B2 sequences. In situ hybridization demonstrated that the elevated expression of this gene was localized predominantly in the CA1 pyramidal neurons. The level of expression in the CA1 region decreased dramatically between 24 and 72 h after ischemia. The elevated expression of clone 17a was not observed in four-vessel occlusion rats treated with the compound LY231617, an antioxidant known to exert neuroprotection in rats subjected to global ischemia. Since delayed neuronal death has the characteristics of apoptosis, we speculate that clone 17a may be involved in apoptosis. We examined the expression level of clone 17a inin vitro models of apoptosis using cerebellar granule neurons that were subjected to potassium removal, glutamate toxicity, or 6-hydroxydopamine treatment and found that clone 17a transcripts were induced in cerebellar granule neurons by glutamate or 6-hydroxydopamine stimulation but not potassium withdrawal.

A short period of global cerebral ischemia in rodents causes neurons in the striatum, hippocampus, and lateral thalamus to die (1Pulsinelli W.A. Brierley J.B. Plum F. Ann. Neurol. 1982; 11: 491-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (2378) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, pyramidal neurons in the CA1 region of the hippocampus undergo delayed neuronal death 3–5 days after the insult (1Pulsinelli W.A. Brierley J.B. Plum F. Ann. Neurol. 1982; 11: 491-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (2378) Google Scholar, 2Kirino T. Brain Res. 1982; 239: 57-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (2514) Google Scholar). A similar phenomenon occurs in human cerebral ischemia (3Petito C.K. Feldmann E. Pulsinelli W.A. Plum F. Neurology. 1987; 37: 1281-1286Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This time lag provides a window of opportunity for therapeutic interventions after ischemic injury. However, the molecular mechanisms that trigger and lead to delayed neuronal death have not been well established, although many hypotheses have been proposed such as excitotoxicity of glutamate, disturbed calcium homeostasis, altered lipid metabolism, free radicals, and mitochondrial involvement (for reviews, see Refs. 4Abe K. Aoki M. Kawagoe J. Yoshida T. Hattori A. Kogure K. Itoyama Y. Stroke. 1995; 26: 1478-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar and 5Juurlink B.H. Sweeney M.I. Neurosci. Biobehav. Rev. 1997; 21: 121-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). There is a growing body of evidence suggesting that apoptotic events occur in both global and focal brain ischemia (6Heron A. Pollard H. Dessi F. Moreau J. Lasbennes F. Ben-Ari Y. Charriaut-Marlangue C. J. Neurochem. 1993; 61: 1973-1976Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 7Honkaniemi J. Massa S.M. Breckinridge M.

Neurosci. 1998; 18: 4914-4928Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is possible that many of these hypotheses may in fact represent different aspects of a common mechanism. One of the approaches that can be used to further our understanding of the molecular mechanism of delayed neuronal death is to establish the gene expression profile of the process. Differential expression of many genes has been observed in ischemic brains, including some immediate early genes, heat shock proteins, and factors controlling apoptosis such as Bcl2, Bcl-x, Bax, and caspases (for reviews, see Refs. 9MacManus J.P.

In our study, we used a rat model of global cerebral ischemia induced by 30 min of four-vessel occlusion (4VO). Since we are interested in gene induction prior to severe neuronal damage, and it is known that histological evidence of neuronal damage in the CA1 region of this model is not observed at 24 h after reperfusion (16Clemens J.A.

Brierley J.B. Stroke. 1979; 10: 267-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (1798) Google Scholar). Briefly, Wistar rats (Hilltop Labs, Scottsdale, PA) were prepared for forebrain ischemia by electrocauterizing the bilateral vertebral arteries and placing atraumatic clasps around the common carotid arteries without interrupting the arterial blood flow. Rats were anesthetized for the whole procedure using 2% halothane inhalation. On the following day, forebrain ischemia was induced by tightening the clasps for 30 min. In the case of sham-treated animals, the carotids were exposed but not occluded. Body temperature was maintained at 37 °C for 1 h during and after the 4VO treatment by means of heat lamps. Animals were sacrificed by decapitation at 24, 48, and 72 h after ischemia or sham operation. All animal procedures were performed in accordance with institutional guidelines. Compound LY231617 (Lilly) was given orally 30 min before 4VO and again 4 h after 4VO at a dose of 50 mg/kg. Control rats received 2% acacia vehicle. Primary cultures of CGNs were prepared from 8-day-old-Harlan Sprague-Dawley rat pups (Harlan Breeders, Indianapolis, IN) as described by Gallo et al. (18Gallo V. Ciotti M.T. Coletti A. Aloisi F. Levi G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 7919-7923Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). Cells were dissociated from freshly dissected cerebella by mechanical disruption in the presence of trypsin and DNase (Sigma) and were resuspended in basal medium, Eagle's (Life Technologies, Inc.), supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 25 mmKCl, and 0.1 mg/ml gentamicin (Life Technologies, Inc.). Cells were seeded at a density of 1.2–1.5 × 106 cells/ml on poly-l-lysine-coated dishes. Cytosine arabinoside (10 μm; Sigma) was added to the culture medium 24 h after initial plating to arrest the growth of non-neuronal cells. Cultures were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified incubator with 95% air, 5% CO2 and were fed with glucose (10 mm) after 7 days in vitro and thereafter every 4th day. Cultures generated by this method have been shown to contain 95% granule neurons (19Nicoletti F. Wroblewski J.T. Novelli A. Alho H. Guidotti A. Costa E. J. Neurosci. 1986; 6: 1905-1911Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In all experiments, neurons were used after being cultured 7–8 days in vitro. For low K+-induced neuronal apoptosis, the concentration of KCl in the conditioned medium was switched from 25 to 5 mm for an overnight treatment. For glutamate-induced apoptosis, CGNs were treated with glutamate (Sigma) at a final concentration of 30 μmin a 12-well plate (3.8 cm2/well) and incubated overnight. In a separate experiment, CGNs were treated with 50 μm6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) (Research Biochemicals, Natick, MA) overnight. Oligonucleotides were custom-synthesized by Genosys Corp. (The Woodlands, Texas). Peptide synthesis and rabbit antibody production was provided by Genemed Synthesis, Inc. (South San Francisco, CA). Total RNA was isolated from eight 4VO- and eight sham-treated animals. The region of the dorsal hippocampus containing the CA1 layer was carefully dissected from the remainder of the hippocampus, immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C. Total RNA was isolated using the RNAgents® total RNA isolation system (Promega Corp., Madison, WI) following the manufacturer's instructions. To remove DNA contamination, 5 μg of total RNA from each animal was incubated at 37 °C for 30 min with 1 unit of amplification grade RNase-free DNase I (Life Technologies, Inc.) in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 10 mmMgCl2. The DNA digestion was terminated by addition of 1 μl of 0.5 m EDTA and 3 μl of 2 m sodium acetate per 50-μl reaction. RNA was then phenol-extracted and precipitated (20Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). For first strand cDNA synthesis, total RNA (2 μg) pooled from four animals was used for each reaction. The reaction contained 20 pmol of T12G, T12C, or T12A as primers. Other reagents were obtained from the SuperScript II RT kit (Life Technologies, Inc.). The DD-PCR was performed with 20 ng of first strand cDNA, 20 pmol of each primer, 20 pmol of each dNTP, 1 μCi of [α-33P]dATP (NEN Life Science Products), PCR buffer containing 1.5 mm MgCl2, and 1 unit of AmpliTaq® DNA polymerase (Perkin-Elmer) per 20-μl reaction. The arbitrary primer used in this study was 5′-AATCGGGCTG-3′. Oligo(dT) primers were the same as those used in the first strand cDNA synthesis. Thermocycles were performed in a Peltier Thermal Cycler, PTC-225 (MJ Research, Inc., Watertown, MA) as follows: 92 °C, 2 min; 40 times (92 °C, 15 s; 40 °C, 2 min; ramp to 72 °C in 1 min; 72 °C, 1 min); 72 °C, 5 min and kept at 4 °C thereafter until further processed. The PCR products were incubated with 15 μl of loading buffer at 95 °C for 2 min. Samples, 3 μl each, were electrophoresed at 1700 V on a 6% polyacrylamide gel containing 8.3 m urea until the xylene cyanol marker reached the bottom. After immobilizing the gel on Whatman 3MM paper and drying for 30 min under vacuum at 80 °C, the gel was exposed to a Biomax MR film (Eastman Kodak Co.) overnight. The intensity of the bands on the x-ray film is indicative of expression levels of the transcripts. Differentially expressed bands were observed between 4VO- and sham-treated animals. The DD-PCR was repeated with the primer pairs that detected the differential expression. To achieve higher resolution, PCR products containing bands with the confirmed difference were electrophoresed on a 60-cm-long polyacrylamide gel using a genomyxLR high-throughput sequencer (Genomyx Corp., Foster City, CA). The bands of interest were excised and immersed in 100 μl of 10 mm Tris buffer containing 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0. The DNA was eluted by cycles of freezing, thawing, and vortexing. Five μl of eluted DNA was amplified with 60 pmol of each primer used for DD-PCR, PCR buffer, 6 nmol of each dNTP, and 2.5 units of AmpliTaq Gold® DNA polymerase (Perkin-Elmer) per 60-μl reaction. Thermocycles were performed in a Peltier Thermal Cycler, PTC-225 (MJ Research, Inc., as follows: 92 °C, 15 min; 40 times (92 °C, 15 s; 40 °C, 2 min; ramp to 72 °C in 1 min; 72 °C, 1 min); 72 °C, 10 min and kept at 4 °C thereafter until further processed. The PCR products were purified with the QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen Inc., Chatsworth, CA) and ligated with pCR 2.1 vector using the original TA cloning kit (Invitrogen Corp., Carlsbad, CA). The plasmids were transformed into MAX Efficiency DH5α or DH10B competent cells (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were incubated at 37 °C for 18 h in Magnificent Broth (MacConnell Research Corp., San Diego, CA) containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin. Plasmid DNAs were purified using the QIAwell ultra plasmid kit (Qiagen). Clones that contained inserts were submitted for automated DNA sequencing (Lilly DNA Technology group, Indianapolis, IN). The nucleic acid and deduced peptide sequences were searched in GenBankTM and GenEMBLTM data bases using the FastA and BLAST algorithms provided in the Genetics Computer Group (GCG) software package (21Genetics Computer GroupWisconsin Package, Version 9.1. Genetics Computer Group(GCG), Madison, WI1997Google Scholar). Northern blotting was carried out as described originally by Alwine et al. (22Alwine J.C. Kemp D.J. Parker B.A. Reiser J. Renart J. Stark G.R. Wahl G.M. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 68: 220-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar) with modifications. Ten μg of each RNA sample and 10 μg of 0.24–9.5-kb RNA ladder (Life Technologies, Inc.) was denatured and subjected to electrophoresis on 1.2% agarose gels containing 2.2 mformaldehyde. The gels were routinely stained with ethidium bromide to visualize the RNA ladder and to verify that each lane contained similar amounts of undegraded rRNAs. RNA was transferred onto Zeta-Probe GT nylon membranes (Bio-Rad) at 160 V in 50 mm Tris buffer containing 45 mm boric acid and 0.5 mm EDTA for 1 h at 4 °C and cross-linked by baking at 80 °C in vacuum for 30 min. The insert of clone 17a was released from pCR 2.1 withEcoRI, separated on agarose gel, excised, and extracted with the Prep-A-Gene kit (Bio-Rad). Labeling was performed with 50 μCi of [α-32P]dCTP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) per 20-μl reaction using the random primed DNA labeling kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Hybridizations were performed in 50% formamide, 0.12m Na2HPO4, 0.25 m NaCl, and 7%(w/v) sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) at 43 °C overnight. The blots were washed twice, each for 10 min, at room temperature in 30 mm sodium citrate buffer, pH 7.0, containing 0.3m NaCl and 0.1% SDS. A third wash was conducted at 65 °C, for 10 min, in 3 mm sodium citrate buffer, pH 7.0, containing 30 mm NaCl and 0.1% SDS. To check RNA loading in each lane, some membranes were stripped and rehybridized with probes synthesized from a human actin cDNA (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA). DNA sequences at the 5′ and 3′ ends of clone 17a cDNAs were determined by RACE using the rat brain Marathon-Ready cDNA (whole brains pooled from normal Harlan Sprague-Dawley males, 10–12 weeks of age;CLONTECH). Briefly, a 25-μl PCR reaction contained the clone 17a-specific primer (0.2 μm), theCLONTECH adaptor primer (0.2 μm), 0.25 ng of Marathon-Ready cDNA, KlenTaq PCR reaction buffer, dNTPs (0.2 mm each), and Advantage KlenTaq polymerase mix (CLONTECH). Thermocycles were programmed as follows: 94 °C, 1 min; 5 times (98 °C, 10 s and 72 °C, 1 min); 5 times (98 °C, 10 s and 70 °C, 1 min); 25 times (98 °C, 10 s and 68 °C, 1 min); 68 °C, 2 min and kept at 4 °C thereafter until further processed. The sense primer 5′-GAGAGATGGCTCAGCGGTTAAGAGCAC-3′ was used as the gene-specific primer 2 (GSP2) for 3′-RACE. The antisense primer 5′-GAAGAGGGCATCAGATCTC-ATTACAGATGG-3′ was used as GSP1 for 5′-RACE. The amplification products were electrophoresed on 4% agarose gels and transferred to a Zeta-Probe GT membrane (Bio-Rad) for Southern blot analysis. Biotinylated 5′-CCCAGCAACCACATGGTGGCTCACAACC-3′, a sequence between GSP1 and GSP2, was used as a probe for Southern blot analysis. The RACE products corresponding to the specific bands on the Southern blot were extracted from the agarose gel matrix with the Prep-A-Gene DNA purification kit (Bio-Rad), ligated into a pCR2.1 vector (Invitrogen), and transformed into Max Efficiency DH5α competent cells (Life Technologies, Inc.). Ampicillin-resistant colonies were characterized by PCR amplification with a variety of primer combinations and DNA sequencing. For in situhybridization, five 4VO- and five sham-treated animals were examined. Rat forebrains were rapidly frozen in isopentane chilled with dry ice and serially sectioned at −20 °C in the coronal planes throughout the rostral-caudal axis of the hippocampus. Sixteen-micron-thick sections were thaw-mounted onto gelatin-coated slides and stored at −80 °C until processed for in situ hybridization. Regions evaluated included only those that contained the same coronal sections of the dorsal hippocampus. BamHI-EcoRI fragments of clone 17a were constructed by the expand high fidelity PCR system (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The 131-bp fragments were inserted into the plasmid vector pT7/T3-18 (Ambion, Austin, TX) with T4 DNA ligase (Life Technologies, Inc.). Vectors containing the insert were linearized with EcoRI or BamHI separately at 37 °C, purified with the QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen), and used as the templates to synthesize the probes. Single-stranded RNA probes were synthesized in the presence of 35S-UTP using the riboprobe in vitro transcription system (T3/T7; Promega). Antisense and sense RNA probes were transcribed with either T3 or T7 RNA polymerase corresponding to the promoter region flanking the insert sequence in the T3/T7-18 vector. After in vitrotranscription, RNA probes were treated with RNase-free DNase I to remove the template DNA. The hybridization was conducted with the SureSite hybridization reagents kit (Novagen, Inc. Madison, WI) following the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, frozen tissue sections were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min and permeabilized with 1 μg/ml proteinase K for 10 min at room temperature. Each slide was covered with 80 μl of hybridization buffer containing 107 cpm of RNA probes. Hybridization was performed for 18 h at 50 °C in a humidified chamber. Background controls were performed on 4VO sections using the sense RNA as a probe. For experimental controls, sections of sham-operated animals were hybridized with the antisense probe. After hybridization, unbound probes were digested with RNase A (20 μg/ml) for 30 min at 37 °C. The post-hybridization washes were all performed at 50 °C. Air-dried slides were exposed to Hyperfilm-βMAX x-ray film (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 1 h and developed manually in Kodak developer d-19. For higher resolution, sections were covered with 50% Kodak NTB-2 emulsion and exposed for 2.5 h in the dark. The slides were developed, counter-stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E), mounted with paramount, and photographed using both light- and dark-field microscopy. To identify differentially expressed genes in response to transient cerebral ischemia, poly(A) RNAs prepared from the dorsal hippocampus of 4VO- and sham-operated rats were compared by differential display analysis. We detected both up- and down-regulated transcripts. However, we focused on an ischemia-induced transcript, clone 17a. Fig.1 displays the result of DD-PCR that contained clone 17a. The products from each DD-PCR reaction were loaded in two lanes. Each lane contained 70–150 bands. Interestingly, the arbitrary primer sequence was found at both ends of the amplified fragment of clone 17a (Fig. 2). Apparently, the same random primer was used as both 5′ and 3′ primers in the DD-PCR, and the anchored oligo(dT)primer was left unused. Conceivably, amplification of clone 17a fragments occurred in all DD-PCR reactions containing the random primer 5′-AATCGGGCTG-3′, no matter which oligo(dT) primer was used.Figure 2Nucleotide sequence of clone 17a. The sequence of the arbitrary primer used in differential display analysis is in bold type. GSP1 and GSP2 (underlined) were paired with the adaptor primer used in 5′- and 3′-RACE, respectively. The direction of primer extension is indicated by thearrows.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To confirm the gene expression patterns observed in differential display analysis, the clone 17a fragment was used as the template for probe synthesis in Northern blot analysis. Clone 17a transcripts showed an approximately 35-fold increase in 4VO animals versus sham (Fig.3). The size range of the transcripts was 160–350 bases. Data base search of clone 17a in GenBankTMand GenEMBLTM using the BLAST and FastA programs revealed regions of homology to rodent B2 sequences and a rat somatotropin intron. To check whether somatotropin mRNA is elevated in the 4VO rat, the fifth exon (1909–2109) of rat presomatotropin gene (GenBankTM accession number J00740 or V01238) was used as a probe for Northern blot analysis. Hippocampal total RNA was loaded, 10 μg per lane, and probed with 32P-labeled fifth exon fragments generated by PCR. A higher level of somatotropin expression was not observed in 4VO rats (data not shown). On the other hand, B2 sequences are believed to be spread throughout the genome by retrotransposition and are found in both introns and exons of other genes (23Weiner A.M. Deininger P.L. Efstratiadis A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1986; 55: 631-661Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To get full-length cDNA, the sequence of clone 17a obtained from DD-PCR was used to design primers for 5′- and 3′-RACE (Fig. 2). The 5′-RACE was conducted using GSP1. Heterogeneity at the 5′ end was observed in both length and base composition (data not shown); however, the consensus sequences started at GAGATG (Fig. 2). By using GSP2, the 3′-RACE produced multiple sequences as well (Fig.4). Sequence alignment using GCG software showed a consensus sequence of about 160 bases. Most of the RACE sequences contained open reading frames (ORF) of either 29- or 40-amino acid peptides. Further analysis of these transcripts revealed promoter regions, box A and B (24Bladon T.S. Fregeau C.J. McBurney M.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 4058-4067Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), of RNA polymerase III (polIII) within the transcripts. The poly(A) addition signal, transcription stop sequence, and poly(A) tail was found at the ends of most 3′ sequences. The sequence results indicate that the transcripts are products of polIII and match the characteristics of rodent B2 sequences. The ORFs seen in clone 17a gene family suggest that peptides could be generated by these sequences. Proteins coded by small open reading frames (<100 amino acids) belong to a number of important categories, such as ATPase modulators, stress proteins, transcriptional regulators, and antioxidants (for review, see Ref. 25Basrai M.A. Hieter P. Boeke J.D. Genome Res. 1997; 7: 768-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). To see whether the clone 17a gene is translated, a rabbit polyclonal antibody was generated against the synthetic peptide CSSRGHEFNSQQPHGGSQPSVKRSD deduced from the clone F3 sequence (Fig. 4). The full-length peptide is predicted to have a molecular mass of 4.4 kDa and an isoelectrical point of 8.7. To search for the hypothetical peptide, proteins were extracted from the hippocampus of 4VO and sham rats and analyzed, 80 μg per lane, by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and Western blotting. The peptide was not detected by the antibody raised against the synthetic peptide. Transfection of 293 cells with the clone F3 sequence in a pcDNA3.1 vector yielded no detectable peptide expression. To date, translation of B2 sequences has not been reported. To examine the tissue-specific expression of clone 17a in rat brain, an antisense riboprobe was transcribed from clone 17a and hybridized with rat brain sections. After x-ray film exposure, strong expression was detected mainly in the CA1 region of 4VO hippocampi (Fig.5 A). Some expression was observable in the cortex of 4VO brains as well. Brain sections of sham-treated rats showed a background level expression with the antisense probe (Fig. 5 B). The specificity of the hybridization reaction was confirmed by comparison of signals generated from the antisense probe (Fig. 5 A) and the sense probe (Fig.5 C) on 4VO brain sections. By using emulsion, higher resolution (1000×) was achieved (Fig.6). In the CA1 region of a 4VO hippocampus, silver grains were found in the cytoplasm of pyramidal neurons. Since sections were counter-stained with H&E, nuclei are shown as dark gray areas in the bright-field image. In dark-field microscopy, silver grains reflect light and are shown as bright particles in a dark background. In the same brain region of sham animals, silver grains were also observed around nuclei but with a much less density. The same observation was made in brain sections derived from five individual animals. This result confirms the differential expression of clone 17a in 4VO rats discovered by RT-PCR and Northern blot analysis and is consistent with the fact that B2 poly(A) RNAs are mainly distributed in the cytoplasm (26Kramerov D.A. Tillib S.V. Lekakh I.V. Ryskov A.P. Georgiev G.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 824: 85-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar).Figure 6Expression of clone 17a in the CA1 regions of hippocampi. Brain sections from 4VO- and sham-treated rats werein situ hybridized with the 35S-labeled antisense riboprobes derived from the clone 17a DNA fragment. The sections were covered with 50% Kodak NTB-2 emulsion, exposed for 2.5 h in the dark, and counter-stained with H&E. The CA1 regions were photographed with both light- and dark-field microscopy. Clone 17a transcripts were visualized as the light grains in the dark-field images. These results were replicated with brain sections from five separate animal experiments.

https://openalex.org/W2944976155,"Imagine that you can vividly describe the neighborhood in which you grew up 60 years ago but are unable to remember anything about the area in which you now live. This is the plight of a 76-year-old amnesic man who suffered damage to the hippocampus and other structures in the medial temporal lobe (MTL) of the brain (see the figure, previous page) after encephalitis. His misfortune has proved providential for neuroscientists studying how the brain forms memories, a process known to involve the hippocampus.

Teng and Squire, the University of California researchers who studied the amnesic patient, report in a recent issue of Nature ([1][1]) that he could recall as readily as several of his old schoolmates how to navigate from his boyhood home to school and gave comparable responses to a series of questions about the neighborhood in which he grew up. But, he could give no directions at all from his current residence to particular locations in his new neighborhood (to which he moved after becoming amnesic). The investigators conclude that the hippocampus is essential for forming new memories of places but that these memories are stored for long-term retrieval in other parts of the brain.

A neuroimaging study in mice, reported in a companion paper ([2][2]), supports that conclusion and identifies regions of the neocortex where place memories are eventually stored. Bontempi et al. (University of Bordeaux) taught their mice to discriminate between eight arms of a radial maze (three arms contained food, the other five did not). Five or 25 days after learning the task, the mice (injected with a radioactive tracer) were again presented with the maze, and changes in metabolic activity in different brain regions were visualized by neuroimaging. Mice negotiating the maze after a 25-day hiatus showed decreased metabolic activity in the hippocampus but increased activity in several neocortical structures compared with mice that had traversed the maze just 5 days previously. But presenting mice with a new maze (in which food appeared in different arms), 25 days after they had memorized the original version, reactivated hippocampal activity as new memories were formed. Although the hippocampus is active in the early formation of spatial memories, it appears that they are gradually consolidated and stored outside of the MTL in the neocortex. With the finding that other regions of the MTL (within the parahippocampal gyrus) are important for the initial step in memory encoding (see page [1503][3]), the intricate skeins of memory's web are slowly becoming untangled.
