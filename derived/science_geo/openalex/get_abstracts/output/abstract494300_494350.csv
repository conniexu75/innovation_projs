https://openalex.org/W4239894970,"Growing evidence indicates that bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs) enhance wound repair via paracrine. Because the extent of environmental oxygenation affects the innate characteristics of BM-MSCs, including their stemness and migration capacity, the current study set out to elucidate and compare the impact of normoxic and hypoxic cell-culture conditions on the expression and secretion of BM-MSC-derived paracrine molecules (e.g., cytokines, growth factors and chemokines) that hypothetically contribute to cutaneous wound healing in vivo. Semi-quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) analyses of normoxic and hypoxic BM-MSCs and their conditioned medium fractions showed that the stem cells expressed and secreted significantly higher amounts of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF),vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A) interleukin 6 (IL-6) and interleukin 8 (IL-8) under hypoxic conditions. Moreover, hypoxic BM-MSC-derived conditioned medium (hypoCM) vs. normoxic BM-MSC-derived conditioned medium (norCM) or vehicle control medium significantly enhanced the proliferation of keratinocytes, fibroblasts and endothelial cells, the migration of keratinocytes, fibroblasts, endothelial cells and monocytes, and the formation of tubular structures by endothelial cells cultured on Matrigel matrix. Consistent with these in vitro results, skin wound contraction was significantly accelerated in Balb/c nude mice treated with topical hypoCM relative to norCM or the vehicle control. Notably increased in vivo cell proliferation, neovascularization as well as recruitment of inflammatory macrophages and evidently decreased collagen I, and collagen III were also found in the hypoCM-treated group. These findings suggest that BM-MSCs promote murine skin wound healing via hypoxia-enhanced paracrine."

https://openalex.org/W2021401904,"Mucins are essential components in mucus gels that form protective barriers at all epithelial surfaces, but much remains unknown about their assembly, intragranular organization, and post-secretion unfurling to form mucus. MUC5B is a major polymeric mucin expressed by respiratory epithelia, and we investigated the molecular mechanisms involved during its assembly. Studies of intact polymeric MUC5B revealed a single high affinity calcium-binding site, distinct from multiple low affinity sites on each MUC5B monomer. Self-diffusion studies with intact MUC5B showed that calcium binding at the protein site catalyzed reversible cross-links between MUC5B chains to form networks. The site of cross-linking was identified in the MUC5B D3-domain as it was specifically blocked by D3 peptide antibodies. Biophysical analysis and single particle EM of recombinant MUC5B N terminus (D1D2D′D3; NT5B) and subdomains (D1, D1-D2, D2-D′-D3, and D3) generated structural models of monomers and disulfide-linked dimers and suggested that MUC5B multimerizes by disulfide linkage between D3-domains to form linear polymer chains. Moreover, these analyses revealed reversible homotypic interactions of NT5B at low pH and in high calcium, between disulfide-linked NT5B dimers, but not monomers. These results enable a model of MUC5B to be derived, which predicts mechanisms of mucin intracellular assembly and storage, which may be common to the other major gel-forming polymeric mucins.

Mucus is a viscoelastic gel that is secreted by epithelial cells to protect the epithelium from environmental factors (1Thornton D.J. Rousseau K.

The biological and physical properties of this mucus layer are essential for its protective function, and disruption of mucus organization results in pathology. In the gastrointestinal tract, depletion of the mucus barrier results in increased tumor formation and chronic infection with intestinal dwelling nematodes (2Hasnain S.Z. Wang H. Ghia J.E. Haq N.

In contrast, accumulation in the airways of mucus with abnormal viscosity is a central pathological feature of cystic fibrosis, asthma, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (4Boucher R.C.

Details of the molecular basis of mucus gel properties and function need to be better understood to elucidate the mechanisms underlying these pathological changes. MUC5B is a major gel-forming mucin in respiratory tract mucus and is indispensable for mucociliary clearance that controls bacterial infection (6Roy M.G. Livraghi-Butrico A. Fletcher A.A.

It is a member of a family of high molecular mass (2–50 MDa) polymeric glycoproteins (other members are MUC2, MUC5AC, MUC6, and possibly MUC19) that form the matrix of epithelial mucus gels. Polymeric mucins are encoded by closely related genes, which are selectively expressed in specialized epithelial cells. They are assembled intracellularly and stored in granules prior to secretion, but the molecular mechanisms involved in their assembly into polymers are not fully understood (7Verdugo P. Mucus supramolecular topology: an elusive riddle.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2012; 109 (author reply E2957): E2956Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Polymeric mucins are glycoproteins in which up to 80% of the total mass is carbohydrate. The protein structure of this gene family of mucins shares major features, including central extended regions consisting of serine- and threonine-rich repeats (glycosylated or mucin domains), which form the site of dense O-linked glycan substitution, and these glycosylated regions are interrupted centrally and capped at the N and C termini by folded cysteine-rich domains (1Thornton D.J. Rousseau K. McGuckin M.A. Structure and function of the polymeric mucins in airways mucus.Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2008; 70: 459-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar). The N-terminal (D1-D2-D′-D3) and C-terminal (D4-B-C-CK) cysteine-rich domains are both involved in mucin polymerization through disulfide bridges. Mucins share some sequence similarity in these N- and C-terminal domains to the glycoprotein, von Willebrand factor (vWF) 2The abbreviations used are:vWFvon Willebrand factorEBNAEpstein–Barr virus nuclear antigenSEC-MALLSsize exclusion chromatography multiangle laser light scatteringTEMtransmission electron microscopySAXSsmall angle x-ray scatteringAUCanalytical ultracentrifugation.

Prior to secretion, the assembled mucin polymers are packaged in a highly condensed and dehydrated state inside secretory granules within the epithelial goblet cells or glandular mucous cells in which they are produced. It is at this stage that Ca2+ ions are proposed to charge-shield the sialic acid and sulfate groups on the mucin glycans to help attain a condensed and dehydrated state (17Verdugo P. Aitken M.

Additionally, the calcium-dependent cross-links that we have previously identified between MUC5B mucins through protein sites on the polypeptide (19Raynal B.D. Hardingham T.E. Sheehan J.K.

Recent evidence has shown that mucins are highly organized within the secretory granule and that this is dramatically changed as the mucin is released onto the epithelial surface (20Ambort D.

The mechanism that controls this transition during secretion from the condensed packaged mucin to the expanded gel form remains to be fully elucidated, but it is clear that during secretion there is a large change in the ionic conditions, with a sharp rise in pH and a decrease in Ca2+ concentration, and these have been proposed to help drive the unfolding mechanisms (20Ambort D. Johansson M.E. Gustafsson J.K. Nilsson H.E. Ermund A. Johansson B.R. Koeck P.J. Hebert H. Hansson G.C. Calcium and pH-dependent packing and release of the gel-forming MUC2 mucin.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2012; 109: 5645-5650Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). To define the molecular detail of MUC5B intracellular assembly and packaging in secretory granules, we investigated (a) the interactions of Ca2+ with intact polymeric MUC5B; (b) the mechanism of MUC5B polymeric assembly using MUC5B expressed recombinant N-terminal protein domains; and (c) the effect of Ca2+ and pH on the multimerization of N-terminal protein domains. Fresh whole human saliva (six different donors) was solubilized in 0.1 m NaCl, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, and native MUC5B mucins were purified by CsCl density gradient centrifugation and Sepharose CL-2B size exclusion chromatography as described previously (19Raynal B.D. Hardingham T.E. Sheehan J.K. Thornton D.J. Calcium-dependent protein interactions in MUC5B provide reversible cross-links in salivary mucus.J. Biol.

Samples of purified native MUC5B mucins were labeled with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) as described previously (22Raynal B.D. Hardingham T.E. Thornton D.J. Sheehan J.K.

MUC5B (GenBankTM accession number NM_002458) N-terminal constructs were created consisting of D1-D2-D′-D3 (NT5B) (residues 26–1304) (8Desseyn J.L. Buisine M.P. Porchet N. Aubert J.P. Laine A.

Conditioned medium was collected from stably transfected 293-EBNA cells and transiently transfected A549 cells and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blots probed with anti-His antibody. Recombinant protein was purified by nickel-affinity chromatography using a 1-ml HisTrap FF column followed by size fractionation on Superose 6 (10/300 column eluted in 25 mm Tris, 10 mm NaCl, pH 7.4) and anion exchange chromatography on a Resource Q column (1 ml; eluted with a gradient of 0–0.5 m NaCl in 25 mm Tris, pH 7.4). Protein identity and purity were confirmed by tandem mass spectrometry (MS). For equilibrium dialysis, samples of MUC5B (70 μl at 80 μg/ml) in Hepes-buffered NaCl (10 or 100 mm NaCl) were dialyzed in Dispo-Equilibrium DialyzerTM (molecular mass cut-off 10 kDa) against Hepes-buffered NaCl (70 μl) containing different concentrations of 45CaCl2. After 20 h at room temperature, radioactivity was determined in aliquots of the sample and diffusate by scintillation counting. Data were analyzed with GraphPad Prism 5.0 software, and curves were fitted to a single binding site or multiple binding sites. Diffusion measurements on MUC5B were obtained from confocal fluorescence recovery after photobleaching experiments performed as described previously (19Raynal B.D. Hardingham T.E. Sheehan J.K.

The concentration dependence of MUC5B self-diffusion was determined with FITC-mucin solutions (0.05–0.2 mg/ml) in 0.1 m NaCl, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, with and without 20 mm CaCl2. The inhibition of MUC5B self-diffusion by polypeptide specific antisera (dilution of 1/50) was determined with FITC-mucin (0.1 mg/ml) in 0.1 m NaCl, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, with and without 10 mm CaCl2. Rabbit polyclonal antisera were raised against peptide sequences in nontandem repeat regions of MUC5B (positions of the immunizing peptides on MUC5B are shown in Fig. 2d). MAN-5BI and MAN-5BIII have been described previously (24Thornton D.J. Gray T. Nettesheim P. Howard M. Koo J.S. Sheehan J.K.

MAN5B-VI (D1), MAN5B-VII (D2), and MAN5B-VIII (D3) were tested for reactivity against expressed N-terminal D-domains by Western blotting (see Fig. 2e). For SEC-MALLS analysis, proteins were incubated overnight at 4 °C, in 5 mm CaCl2, 5 mm MgCl2 or 5 mm EGTA at pH 7.4 or pH 6 and then applied to a Superose 6 10/300 column in 25 mm Hepes, 150 mm NaCl (with CaCl2, MgCl2, or EGTA at pH 7.4 or pH 6 at room temperature; n = 3). Column eluents passed through an inline DAWN EOS laser photometer and an Optilab rEX refractometer with quasi-elastic light scattering dynamic light scattering attachment. Analysis was performed using ASTRA version 6 software. For transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and image analysis, protein samples (∼10–20 μg/ml) were negatively stained in 2% (w/v) uranyl acetate. TEM data were recorded on a Tecnai BioTwin at 100 kV under low dose conditions. Images were recorded on a Gatan Orius CCD camera at 3.5 Å/pixel. All image processing was performed using EMAN2 (26Tang G. Peng L. Baldwin P.R. Mann D.S. Jiang W. Rees I. Ludtke S.J. EMAN2: an extensible image processing suite for electron microscopy.J. Struct.

Particles were selected into 72-pixel (NT5B monomer) or 144-pixel (NT5B dimer and D2-D′-D3 complexes) boxes using selective swarm parameters in E2Boxer. All datasets contained ∼5000 unique particles. Following class averaging, preliminary models were generated to assess symmetry. The dimer-enriched sample had a clear C2 symmetry, and this was applied to all subsequent processing. Following five rounds of iterative refinement, the resolution was determined using FSC-0.5 criteria (26Tang G. Peng L. Baldwin P.R. Mann D.S. Jiang W. Rees I. Ludtke S.J.

SAXS data were collected on NT5B protein in 25 mm Tris, 200 mm NaCl, pH 7.4, at the P12 beam line (Petra-III (Deutsches Elektronen Synchrotron (DESY), Hamburg, Germany)). Data were collected at 10 °C using a European Molecular Biology Laboratory/European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (EMBL/ESRF) new generation automated sample changer. The scattering intensities were recorded using a Pilatus 2M pixel x-ray detector (DECTRIS) with sample-to-detector distance of 3.1 m (q-range 0.008–0.47 Å−1). The two-dimensional data were integrated and reduced as described previously (29Franke D. Kikhney A.G. Svergun D.I. Automated acquisition and analysis of small angle x-ray scattering data.Nucl. Instrum. Methods Phys. Res. A. 2012; 689: 52-59Crossref Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Data were analyzed using the ATSAS 2.5.1 software (EMBL Hamburg). An average model was produced from 10 ab initio structures using the DAMAVER software (30Volkov V.V. Svergun D.I. Uniqueness of ab initio shape determination in small-angle scattering.J. Appl.

Commun. 2004; 314: 330-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), binding was determined with increasing NaCl concentration (Fig. 1a). Most of the calcium binding to MUC5B was found to be salt-dependent and was lost in the presence of 100 mm NaCl, but there remained a small salt-independent fraction (Fig. 1, a and b). Characterizing the 45Ca binding in low salt (10 mm NaCl) showed that the amount bound was proportional to the calcium concentration and did not saturate at the conditions tested (Fig. 1b). This main fraction of calcium binding, which is likely attributed to ionic interactions with charged carboxyl and sulfate groups on mucin glycans, was associated with many low affinity binding sites (∼1680 sites/mol; KD ∼ 74 μm; Fig. 1b, inset). In contrast, the small fraction of salt-independent calcium binding (in 100 mm NaCl) was quickly saturated (Fig. 1c), and Scatchard analysis showed higher affinity binding to a single site per mucin monomer (Fig. 1c, inset; ∼0.72 site/mol in the sample tested; KD ∼0.4 μm). To investigate the effect of this high affinity calcium binding on MUC5B macromolecular organization, we performed confocal fluorescence recovery after photobleaching experiments. Calcium caused a major decrease in the self-diffusion of purified FITC-MUC5B (50–200 μg/ml; Fig. 2a). The supporting electrolyte (0.1 m NaCl) in these experiments was sufficient to rule out weak ionic interactions and link the effects to calcium binding at the higher affinity site. These major changes in physical properties with an apparent increase in MUC5B molecular mass, a decrease in self-diffusion, and lowered gel porosity (Fig. 2, b and c) are compatible with the generation of reversible cross-links between polymeric MUC5B chains. To investigate which protein domain of the MUC5B mucin was responsible for the calcium-dependent interactions, antisera raised against peptides from specific regions of MUC5B were tested as inhibitors of the calcium effects on MUC5B self-diffusion (Fig. 2, d–f). Only one antiserum (MAN5B-VIII), which was raised against a unique peptide located in the D3-domain (Fig. 2f), completely inhibited the calcium effect on MUC5B self-diffusion, whereas four other antisera to peptides in D1-, D2-, and Cys-domains and between D3 and the glycosylated domain had no effect (Fig. 2f). As MAN5B-VIII completely blocked the noncovalent calcium-dependent interaction between the MUC5B mucins, its peptide antigen in the D3-domain must be close to the calcium-dependent site mediating MUC5B self-association. The N-terminal region of MUC5B is the site for the covalent disulfide head-to-head linkages that are a recognized core feature of mucin polymer formation. Therefore, to gain further insight into the role of the N-terminal domains in the intracellular assembly, packaging, and organization of MUC5B, we stably expressed the recombinant N-terminal domain of MUC5B (NT5B), which included D1-D2-D′-D3-domains and related truncated constructs in 293-EBNA cells (Fig. 3a). The expressed MUC5B proteins were purified from conditioned cell medium and analyzed by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 3b), and tandem mass spectrometry confirmed their identity. All of the constructs were expressed and secreted by the 293-EBNA cells. The tendency of some of the expressed constructs to form disulfide-bonded dimers was an initial distinguishing feature (Fig. 3b). Only the constructs containing the D3-domain formed dimers in addition to monomers in the secreted products. The whole N-terminal (NT5B) protein was expressed as a monomer (∼150 kDa) and a dimer (∼300 kDa). The D2-D′-D3 protein and D3 protein were also expressed as monomers (∼110 and ∼50 kDa, respectively) and dimers (∼220 and ∼100 kDa, respectively), whereas the D1 and D1-D2 proteins were expressed only as monomers (∼75 and ∼110 kDa, respectively). These results confirmed that the D3-domain-containing constructs expressed in 293-EBNA cells replicated the intermolecular disulfide links observed in intact MUC5B. Biophysical characterization of NT5B (Fig. 3d) and the other N-terminal protein subdomains (D1, D1-D2, D2-D′-D3, and D3; Fig. 4, a–d, respectively) was performed by SEC-MALLS to provide size fractionation and absolute determination of molecular mass. SEC-MALLS results confirmed that MUC5B proteins containing the D3-domain were expressed only as monomer and dimer, and those without D3-domain were expressed only as monomers (Fig. 3, d and e). The relative proportion of monomer and dimer varied between NT5B preparations. However, for each preparation studied, there was no suggestion of an equilibrium as the relative proportions of monomer and dimer did not vary with concentration, which was compatible with dimers being disulfide-bonded. This pattern of expression was not unique to 293-EBNA cells as the NT5B construct transiently transfected into A549 cells (a mucin-producing cell line) was also expressed and secreted as a monomer and disulfide-linked dimer (Fig. 3c). To investigate the structure of the purified NT5B monomer and dimer, we performed single particle TEM. Samples enriched in either monomeric or dimeric NT5B were separated by size exclusion chromatography and imaged in negative stain (Fig. 5a). For each sample, a three-dimensional reconstruction was calculated from ∼5000 particles. The structure of the monomer-enriched NT5B had three distinct lobes, potentially corresponding to the three D-domains, which formed an elongated but bent shape (Fig. 5b) with dimensions of 13 × 9.5 × 7 nm. The structure visualized from the dimer-enriched NT5B sample was approximately twice the size of the monomer with dimensions 24 × 17 × 9 nm. The dimer also had an extended, boomerang-like shape, but with a more pronounced central region (Fig. 5, c and e). To confirm that the D3-domain was located centrally within the dimer, a construct (D2-D′-D"

In this study, we used a new screening approach that better reflects the physiological environment that C. albicans cells experience during infection to identify potential inhibitors of ICL. Three compounds (caffeic acid (CAFF), rosmarinic acid (ROS), and apigenin (API)) were found to have antifungal activity against C. albicans when tested under glucose-depleted conditions. We further confirmed the inhibitory potential of these compounds against ICL using the ICL enzyme assay. Lastly, we assessed the bioavailability and toxicity of these compounds using Lipinski's rule-of-five and ADMET analysis."
https://openalex.org/W2040811079,"The development of metabolic syndrome (MetS) is influenced by environmental factors such as smoking and alcohol consumption. We determined the combined effects of smoking and alcohol on MetS and its individual components.64,046 participants aged 18-80 years from the LifeLines Cohort study were categorized into three body mass index (BMI) classes (BMI<25, normal weight; BMI 25-30, overweight; BMI≥30 kg/m2, obese). MetS was defined according to the revised criteria of the National Cholesterol Education Program's Adult Treatment Panel III (NCEP ATP III). Within each BMI class and smoking subgroup (non-smoker, former smoker, <20 and ≥20 g tobacco/day), the cross-sectional association between alcohol and individual MetS components was tested using regression analysis.Prevalence of MetS varied greatly between the different smoking-alcohol subgroups (1.7-71.1%). HDL cholesterol levels in all alcohol drinkers were higher than in non-drinkers (0.02 to 0.29 mmol/L, P values<0.001). HDL cholesterol levels were lower when they were also a former or current smoker (<20 and ≥20 g tobacco/day). Consumption of ≤1 drink/day indicated a trend towards lower triglyceride levels (non-significant). Concurrent use alcohol (>1 drink/day) and tobacco showed higher triglycerides levels. Up to 2 drinks/day was associated with a smaller waist circumference in overweight and obese individuals. Consumption of >2 drinks/day increased blood pressure, with the strongest associations found for heavy smokers. The overall metabolic profile of wine drinkers was better than that of non-drinkers or drinkers of beer or spirits/mixed drinks.Light alcohol consumption may moderate the negative associations of smoking with MetS. Our results suggest that the lifestyle advice that emphasizes smoking cessation and the restriction of alcohol consumption to a maximum of 1 drink/day, is a good approach to reduce the prevalence of MetS."
https://openalex.org/W1972429626,"The storage of protein/peptide hormones within subcellular compartments and subsequent release are crucial for their native function, and hence these processes are intricately regulated in mammalian systems. Several peptide hormones were recently suggested to be stored as amyloids within endocrine secretory granules. This leads to an apparent paradox where storage requires formation of aggregates, and their function requires a supply of non-aggregated peptides on demand. The precise mechanism behind amyloid formation by these hormones and their subsequent release remain an open question. To address this, we examined aggregation and fibril reversibility of a cyclic peptide hormone somatostatin (SST)-14 using various techniques. After proving that SST gets stored as amyloid in vivo, we investigated the role of native structure in modulating its conformational dynamics and self-association by disrupting the disulfide bridge (Cys(3)-Cys(14)) in SST. Using two-dimensional NMR, we resolved the initial structure of somatostatin-14 leading to aggregation and further probed its conformational dynamics in silico. The perturbation in native structure (S-S cleavage) led to a significant increase in conformational flexibility and resulted in rapid amyloid formation. The fibrils formed by disulfide-reduced noncyclic SST possess greater resistance to denaturing conditions with decreased monomer releasing potency. MD simulations reveal marked differences in the intermolecular interactions in SST and noncyclic SST providing plausible explanation for differential aggregation and fibril reversibility observed experimentally in these structural variants. Our findings thus emphasize that subtle changes in the native structure of peptide hormone(s) could alter its conformational dynamics and amyloid formation, which might have significant implications on their reversible storage and secretion."

The founding member of the family, LRRC8A, was identified when white blood cells from a patient suffering from congenital agammaglobulinemia showed a balanced chromosomal translocation t(9;20)(q33.2;q12) that resulted in the expression of both a normal copy of LRRC8A and a truncated form of LRRC8A that lacks the last two and a half LRR domains (3Sawada A.

Forced expression of the truncated version of LRRC8A in murine bone marrow cells inhibited B cell development and confirmed that the patient's B cell deficiency was due to the mutation in LRRC8A. Given the dominant nature of the mutation and the presence of LRRs in the extracellular binding domain of diverse receptors (Toll-like receptors, follicle-stimulating hormone receptor, high affinity nerve growth factor receptor), LRRC8A was proposed to function as a cell surface receptor that oligomerizes upon binding an unknown ligand important for B cell development (6Bella J.

The only other functional studies on LRRC8s concern adipocyte development. LRRC8C, also known as FAD158, was identified as a gene whose expression is induced in the early stage of adipocyte differentiation (4Tominaga K. Kondo C. Kagata T. Hishida T. Nishizuka M. Imagawa M.

When LRRC8C−/− and wild-type mice were fed a high fat diet, LRRC8C−/− mice had significantly lower body weights and fat mass (5Hayashi T. Nozaki Y. Nishizuka M. Ikawa M. Osada S. Imagawa M.

How exactly LRRC8C is involved in adipocyte differentiation and the development of obesity in response to a high fat diet remains unclear. A recent hypothesis paper, based exclusively on a bioinformatics approach, proposed that LRRC8s evolved from the combination of a pannexin and an LRR domain prior to the diversification of chordates (2Abascal F. Zardoya R. LRRC8 proteins share a common ancestor with pannexins, and may form hexameric channels involved in cell-cell communication.Bioessays. 2012; 34: 551-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Sequence similarity and inferred homology between LRRC8s and pannexins would place the LRR domains of LRRC8s facing the cytoplasm rather than the outside of the cell, in contrast to the report by Sawada et al. (3Sawada A. Takihara Y. Kim J.Y. Matsuda-Hashii Y. Tokimasa S. Fujisaki H. Kubota K. Endo H. Onodera T. Ohta H. Ozono K. Hara J.

Pannexins are a family of communication channels composed of four α-helical transmembrane domains. They are thought to function primarily in transporting intracellular molecules to the extracellular space (7Penuela S. Gehi R. Laird D.W. The biochemistry and function of pannexin channels.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2013; 1828: 15-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Whereas pannexins could participate in many biological processes, evidence is strongest for a role of pannexin 1 (Panx1) in the release of “find-me” signals, specifically ATP and UTP, by apoptotic cells to recruit phagocytes (7Penuela S.

Whereas LRRC8s, like pannexins, might form channels and participate in cell-cell communication, there has been no experimental evidence to support such a role. Here we show that LRRC8D is required for the import of the antibiotic blasticidin S (BlaS) by mammalian cells and is the first protein implicated in this process, supporting a role for LRRC8s in solute transport. We further provide evidence that the LRR domains of LRRC8A and LRRC8D face the cytoplasm rather than extracellular space and that LRRC8D interacts with LRRC8A, LRRC8B, and LRRC8C. cDNA was obtained from either RAW 264.7 macrophages or KBM7 cells for use as a cloning template.

Clones were expanded and then assayed for a gene trap insertion in the LRRC8D locus by PCR using primers 5′-TCTCCAAATCTCGGTGGAAC-3′ and 5′-CCAGACTAAACATCTCAGAACTCG-3′. To confirm that the cells were truly clonal and to confirm the absence of the wild-type DNA locus, a PCR was performed with primers 5′-GGATCTCTCTAGCTCTTTCTCTCC-3′ and 5′-CCAGACTAAACATCTCAGAACTCG-3′. The absence of the LRRC8D transcript in the isolated mutant clones was determined by RT-PCR. Total RNA was isolated using the RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen) and reverse-transcribed using the SuperScriptTM III First-strand synthesis system (Invitrogen).

CellTiter-Glo Luminescent Cell Viability Assay (Promega) was used to quantify cell viability. 200,000 cells were seeded per well in clear bottom 96-well plates (BD Biosciences or Costar). Transfections were accomplished using Trans-IT 293 (Mirus) for 293T cells. Transductions were accomplished using the pPACKH1 HIV Lentivector Packaging kit (System Biosciences) according to its protocol. Four million wild-type reporter cells, LRRC8DGT1 cells, and LRRC8DGT2 cells were treated with varying concentrations of BlaS for 3 h in triplicate. Cells were washed twice in ice-cold Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium and one time in ice-cold, filtered 0.9% NaCl. 200 μl of ice-cold extraction buffer (40% acetonitrile, 40% methanol, 20% water, 10 ng/ml phenylalanine-d8, 10 ng/ml valine-d8) was added to each cell pellet. Extracts were vortexed for 30 s and then spun at 14,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C in a table-top centrifuge. Extract supernatants were transferred to new Eppendorf tubes and stored at −80 °C until analysis. Extract solvents were obtained from Fisher Scientific and were Optima LC/MS grade; phenylalanine-d8 and valine-d8 were purchased from Cambridge Isotope Laboratories. Solvents were obtained from Fisher Scientific and were Optima LC/MS grade except where otherwise specified. An UltiMate 3000 UPLC system with autosampler (Dionex) was used for this study. Biological triplicate samples (typically 10 μl) were injected onto a Luna-NH2 2 × 150-mm (3-μm particle size) column (Phenomenex) equipped with an inline particulate filter. The mobile phases were 5 mm ammonium acetate, 0.2% ammonium hydroxide, pH 9.9 (mobile phase A) and acetonitrile (mobile phase B). The flow rate was 0.25 ml/min, and the column temperature was held at 15 °C. The column was eluted with a gradient from 90% to 10% mobile phase B over 20 min, held at 10% mobile phase B for 5 min, returned to 90% mobile phase B over 1 min, and re-equilibrated at 90% mobile phase B for 8 min. The UPLC system was coupled to a QExactive orbitrap mass spectrometer equipped with a HESI II probe (Thermo Fisher Scientific) operating in positive ion mode. The spray voltage was set to 3.9 kV, the heated capillary was held at 335 °C, and the HESI probe was held at 350 °C. The sheath gas flow was set to 35 units, the auxiliary gas flow was set to 7 units, and the sweep gas flow was set to 0 unit. External mass calibration was performed every 7 days. The MS data acquisition was performed by targeted Selected Ion Monitoring of the metabolites of interest (BlaS and phenylalanine-d8 as an internal standard), with the resolution set at 70,000, the AGC target at 5 × 104, the maximum injection time at 120 ms, and the isolation window at 1.0 m/z. Quantitation of the data was performed with XCalibur QuanBrowser 2.2 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) using a 5-ppm mass tolerance. Pure BlaS samples in extraction buffer (half-log serial dilution, 1 nm–1 μm) were analyzed to confirm chromatographic retention times and generate standard curves for quantitation of each analytical batch. The limit of detection in sample matrix was 5 nm, as determined by addition of increasing concentrations of BlaS to a pooled BlaS-free cell extract. Cells were washed with PBS, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS, washed with PBS, incubated with a quenching solution containing 20 mm glycine and 50 mm NH4Cl in PBS, washed with PBS, permeabilized with saponin binding buffer (PBS containing 0.1% (v/v) saponin and 0.2% (w/v) BSA), incubated with primary antibodies for 1 h, washed with saponin binding buffer, incubated with secondary antibodies for 1 h, washed with saponin binding buffer, PBS, and then water before mounting on glass slides using ProLong Gold with DAPI (Invitrogen). Images were acquired with a PerkinElmer Life Sciences Ultraview Spinning Disk Confocal equipped with a Hammamatsu ORCA-ER CCD camera and analyzed with Volocity acquisition software. Cells were washed in ice-cold PBS before lysing with Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, and protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science). Lysate concentrations were measured by Bradford Protein Assay (Bio-Rad) and normalized. Lysates were precleared by incubating them with protein G-agarose beads (Sigma P3296) for 1 h at 4 °C. Precleared lysates were then incubated with either anti-HA affinity matrix, anti-V5 antibody with protein G-agarose beads, anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel, or anti-myc-Sepharose beads for 2 h at 4 °C. Beads were washed three times with buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, and 0.1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40. Beads were then boiled in sample buffer, and proteins in the supernatant were resolved by SDS-PAGE. After coimmunoprecipitation, eluted samples were separated by SDS-PAGE, and polypeptides were visualized by silver staining. Bands of interest were excised, digested with trypsin, and analyzed by tandem mass spectrometry. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, blocked with 5% (w/v) skim milk in PBS with 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20 and were probed with the appropriate primary antibodies. Membranes were washed with PBS with 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20 and were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies if necessary. Proteins were visualized with an enhanced chemiluminescence detection reagent. Restore PLUS Western blot Stripping Buffer (Thermo) was used to strip the membranes between probing. Proteins were fixed in polyacrylamide gel by incubating the gel in 40% (v/v) ethanol, 10% (v/v) acetic acid. The gel was washed twice in 30% (v/v) ethanol and once in water. The gel was then sensitized in 0.02% (w/v) Na2S2O3, washed three times in water, incubated in ice-cold 0.1% (w/v) AgNO3, washed four more times in water, and developed in 3% (w/v) Na2CO3, 0.05% (v/v) formaldehyde. When protein bands became sufficiently visible, the gel was washed once in water, and the staining process was terminated by incubating the gel in 5% (v/v) acetic acid. The gel was then washed a final three times in water. Cells were washed in PBS and then resuspended in staining solution containing 1 μg/ml antibody and 3% inactivated fetal calf serum in PBS (PBS/IFS) and incubated in the dark at 4 °C for 30 min. Cells were washed in PBS/IFS and then fixed with PBS containing 4% (v/v) formaldehyde for 30 min at room temperature in the dark. The protocol for permeabilized cells was similar except cells were first fixed, washed with PBS, permeabilized with 0.5% (w/v) saponin in PBS/IFS, stained with 1 μg/ml antibody in 0.5% (w/v) saponin in PBS/IFS, and then washed with PBS/IFS. 293T cells expressing epitope-tagged proteins were washed in ice-cold PBS and then incubated for 10 min in hypotonic buffer containing: 20 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.5, 5 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT. Cells were then broken open with a Dounce homogenizer. NaCl was added to the lysates for a final concentration of 150 mm NaCl. Lysates were spun at 800 × g at 4 °C for 10 min. The supernatant was transferred to a new tube that was then spun at 10,000 × g at 4 °C for 10 min. Pellets were resuspended in buffer containing 50 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.5, 50 mm KOAc, 2 mm Mg(OAc)2, and 250 mm sucrose, and this microsome-containing mixture was equally aliquoted to tubes with or without Triton X-100 (final 1% v/v). Proteinase K (New England Biolabs P8102S) was then added to the samples at varying concentrations, and the samples were incubated on ice for 30 min. PMSF was added to deactivate proteinase K. Sample buffer was added, and the samples were boiled. Proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblot analysis. We identified LRRC8D and LRRC8A as hits in a haploid reporter genetic screen aimed at discovering inhibitors of NF-κB (12Lee C.C. Carette J.E. Brummelkamp T.R. Ploegh H.L. A reporter screen in a human haploid cell line identifies CYLD as a constitutive inhibitor of NF-κB.PLoS One. 2013; 8: e70339Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). We performed the screen with cells carrying a NF-κB transcriptional reporter that drives expression of the blasticidin S-resistance gene (BSR), so that cells in which the NF-κB pathway is activated would survive in the presence of BlaS (Fig. 1A). After insertional mutagenesis, reporter cells that survived in the presence of BlaS were selected, with the expectation that they would contain mutations in NF-κB inhibitors and thus show constitutive expression of the NF-κB-BSR reporter. Indeed, one of the significant hits in the screen, CYLD, is a known negative regulator of NF-κB. We confirmed that CYLD is required at steady state to prevent aberrant activation of NF-κB (12Lee C.C. Carette J.E. Brummelkamp T.R. Ploegh H.L. A reporter screen in a human haploid cell line identifies CYLD as a constitutive inhibitor of NF-κB.PLoS One. 2013; 8: e70339Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). To further characterize LRRC8D, we isolated two clonal cell lines from the screen, LRRC8DGT1 and LRRC8DGT2, that have gene trap insertion sites located in the intron between exon 2 and exon 3 (Fig. 1B). Neither LRRC8DGT1 nor LRRC8DGT2 cell line expresses full-length LRRC8D mRNA (Fig. 1C). Consistent with the design of the gene trap vector, this suggests that in LRRC8DGT1 and LRRC8DGT2 cells, exon 2 is not splicing to exon 3, but rather to the splice acceptor site in the gene trap, which terminates the transcript. Thus, none of the protein coding sequence for LRRC8D, fully contained in exon 3, is expressed in LRRC8DGT1 and LRRC8DGT2 cell lines. We determined that both LRRC8DGT1 and LRRC8DGT2 cell lines are indeed resistant to BlaS (Fig. 1D). We hypothesized that LRRC8D deficiency results in constitutive activation of the NF-κB-BSR reporter and therefore confers BlaS resistance. To our surprise we were unable to demonstrate a defect in NF-κB regulation in LRRC8DGT1 and LRRC8DGT2 cells (data not shown). Previous haploid genetic screens with tunicamycin and 3-bromopyruvate as the selecting agents identified transporters for these small molecules (13Birsoy K. Wang T. Possemato R. Yilmaz O.H. Koch C.E. Chen W.W. Hutchins A.W. Gultekin Y. Peterson T.R. Carette J.E. Brummelkamp T.R. Clish C.B. Sabatini D.M.

Clish C.B. Carette J.E. Varadarajan M. Brummelkamp T.R. Sabatini D.M. A haploid genetic screen identifies the major facilitator domain containing 2A (MFSD2A) transporter as a key mediator in the response to tunicamycin.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2011; 108: 11756-11765Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). We then considered the possibility that resistance of LRRC8DGT1 and LRRC8DGT2 cells to BlaS was attributable to defective import of the antibiotic rather than altered NF-κB signaling. How BlaS enters mammalian cells is not known, but given its polar nature (Fig. 1A), it is unlikely to cross the plasma membrane unaided. There is no easy path to the synthesis of radiolabeled BlaS that could then be used for cellular uptake experiments. We generated a biotinylated version of BlaS for that purpose, but found that it lacked biological activity when applied to intact cells and therefore could not be used as a BlaS analog to measure transport. We resorted to a LC/MS-based assay to directly measure BlaS levels in extracts from BlaS-exposed cells. To determine whether LRRC8D is required for BlaS import, wild-type cells, LRRC8DGT1 cells, and LRRC8DGT2 cells were incubated with varying concentrations of BlaS for 3 h. BlaS levels in extracts made from BlaS-treated cells were measured by targeted mass spectrometry. Whereas BlaS was easily detected in wild-type cells, it was either absent from, or present in only trace amounts in LRRC8DGT1 and LRRC8DGT2 cells, thus demonstrating that LRRC8D deficiency results in defective BlaS import (Fig. 2). We next sought to determine where LRRC8A and LRRC8D are located in the cell. If they are transporters for BlaS and other molecules, one would expect to see them most likely at the plasma membrane. In HeLa cells stably expressing LRRC8A equipped with a C-terminal HA tag, LRRC8A-HA was present at the plasma membrane (Fig. 3). In HeLa cells that stably express LRRC8D-HA, LRRC8D-HA appeared less prominently at the plasma membrane whereas the majority colocalized with calnexin in the ER. Surface display of LRRC8D may require the involvement of a partner protein present in limiting amounts. Overexpression of LRRC8D on its own in the absence of such cofactors would then prevent a major portion of LRRC8D from reaching the plasma membrane. LRR domains are widespread and often mediate protein-protein interactions (6Bella J. Hindle K.L. McEwan P.A. Lovell S.C. The leucine-rich repeat structure.Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2008; 65: 2307-2333Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). The LRR domain of LRRC8A was initially reported to face the outside of cells, but this assertion has recently been questioned based on sequence similarity between LRRC8s and pannexins, a family of communication channels (2Abascal F. Zardoya R. LRRC8 proteins share a common ancestor with pannexins, and may form hexameric channels involved in cell-cell communication.Bioessays. 2012; 34: 551-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 3Sawada A. Takihara Y. Kim J.Y. Matsuda-Hashii Y. Tokimasa S. Fujisaki H. Kubota K. Endo H. Onodera T. Ohta H. Ozono K. Hara J. A congenital mutation of the novel gene LRRC8 causes agammaglobulinemia in humans.J. Clin. Invest. 2003; 112: 1707-1713Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). If LRRC8s have the same topology as pannexins, then the LRR domains of LRRC8s would face the cytoplasm and have access to very different interaction partners than on the outside of cells. To determine the topology of LRRC8A and LRRC8D we performed a flow cytometry experiment. HeLa cells that stably express either empty vector or C-terminally HA-tagged Kell (KEL-HA), glycophorin A (GYPA-HA), LRRC8A, or LRRC8D were incubated with Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated anti-HA in the absence or presence of the detergent saponin (Fig. 4, A and B). Kell, a mammalian type II transmembrane protein, and glycophorin A, a mammalian type I transmembrane protein, are expressed on the cell surface and were used as controls (15Redman C.M. Lee S. The Kell blood group system.Transfus. Clin. Biol. 1995; 2: 243-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 16Chasis J.A. Mohandas N. Red blood cell glycophorins.Blood. 1992; 80: 1869-1879Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As expected, HA was detected on intact cells expressing KEL-HA. Permeabilization with saponin allowed detection of both the plasma membrane and intracellular populations of Kell. In contrast, for cells that express GYPA-HA, the HA tag could be detected only when the cells were permeabilized due to the cytosolic exposure of the tag. Similarly, for cells that express LRRC8A-HA and LRRC8D-HA, the HA tag could be detected only when the cells were permeabilized, suggesting that their LRR domains face the cytosol. Because the expression level of LRRC8D-HA was lower than that of LRRC8A-HA in the stable cell lines used for flow cytometry and because LRRC8D-HA was not as prominently displayed at the plasma membrane in our immunofluorescence experiments, we sought to verify the topology of LRRC8D biochemically with a protease protection assay (Fig. 4, C and D). We used SEL1L and AUP1, members of an ER complex required for the dislocation of misfolded proteins, as controls (10Mueller B. Klemm E.J. Spooner E. Claessen J.H. Ploegh H.L. SEL1L nucleates a protein complex required for dislocation of misfolded glycoproteins.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 12325-12330Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). The N terminus and bulk of SEL1L are located in the ER lumen, whereas AUP1 is a monotypic membrane protein that has both termini facing the cytosol (10Mueller B. Klemm E.J. Spooner E. Claessen J.H. Ploegh H.L. SEL1L nucleates a protein complex required for dislocation of misfolded glycoproteins.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Microsome-containing fractions from 293T transfectants expressing HA-SEL1L, AUP1-GFP, and LRRC8D-HA were incubated with proteinase K in the absence or presence of Triton X-100. Proteinase K-treated samples were then analyzed by immunoblotting. Consistent with the known topology of SEL1L and AUP1, detection of HA-SEL1L was lost only upon addition of both detergent and proteinase K, whereas detection of AUP1-GFP was lost with the addition of proteinase K even in the absence of detergent. Similar to AUP1-GFP, detection of LRRC8D-HA was lost with the addition of proteinase K even in the absence of detergent, thus confirming that the LRR domain of LRRC8D faces the cytosol. Given that the LRR domain of LRRC8s faces the cytosol rather than extracellular space, we hypothesized that the LRR domain could be mediating interactions with cytoplasmic proteins or molecules that affect the opening or closing of a channel of which the LRRC8s might be part. To identify potential interacting partners of LRRC8A and LRRC8D, lysates from RAW 264.7 macrophages that stably express murine LRRC8A-HA, LRRC8D-HA, or empty vector were incubated with anti-HA agarose beads and the immunoprecipitated proteins were identified by mass spectrometry (Table 1). The results indicate that LRRC8A and LRRC8D interact with each other as well as with LRRC8C. A similar experiment with KBM7 cells showed that LRRC8A and LRRC8D interact with LRRC8B as well (data not shown). We verified that LRRC8D interacts with LRRC8A, LRRC8B, and LRRC8C by coexpressing epitope-tagged versions of the proteins in 293T cells, immunoprecipitating for LRRC8A-Myc, LRRC8B-V5, and LRRC8C-FLAG and blotting for LRRC8D-HA in the coimmunoprecipitating fractions (Fig. 5).TABLE 1Identification of potential LRRC8A and LRRC8D interacting partnersImmunoprecipitated proteinLRRC8D-HALRRC8A-HANo. unique peptides% CoverageNo. unique peptides% CoverageLRRC8D31411927LRRC8A15203240LRRC8C10141520Serine hydroxymethyltransferase 2716612Carbamoyl-phosphate synthetase 2, aspartate transcarbamylase, and dihydroorotase74.232.7Heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A/B61841460S acidic ribosomal protein P0523421ADP/ATP translocase 2514311Aldehyde dehydrogenase 2410717Aspartate aminotransferase, mitochondrial41225.1 Open table in a new tab We demonstrated that the interaction between LRRC8s does not occur post-lysis by using transfectants that each express a single epitope-tagged LRRC8 member. Lysates from LRRC8A-Myc, LRRC8B-V5, and LRRC8C-FLAG transfectants were each combined with lysates from LRRC8D-HA transfectants. When LRRC8A-Myc, LRRC8B-V5, and LRRC8C-FLAG were immunoprecipitated from these combined lysates, LRRC8D-HA did not appear in the coimmunoprecipitating fractions. We did not verify the interaction of LRRC8D with the other proteins identified by mass spectrometry, as they were identified with modest peptide coverage. We have found that several of these hits occur as common contaminants in immunoprecipitation-mass spectrometry experiments. Defective LRRC8D expression results in BlaS resistance due to a defect in BlaS import. Because import of a toxic molecule is not a function that would be selected for by evolution, it is likely that there are as yet undiscovered physiological substrates that are normally transported by LRRC8D or the complex of which it is a part. Because BlaS contains both a cytosine moiety and an arginine-like appendage, it is possible that nucleotides, amino acids, or short (modified) peptides could be substrates for LRRC8D. Pannexins, which display homology to LRRC8s, have often been linked to the release of ATP (7Penuela S. Gehi R. Laird D.W. The biochemistry and function of pannexin channels.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2013; 1828: 15-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Thus ATP and other second messengers could be candidate substrates as well. The discovery that LRRC8D has a role in the transport of a small molecule suggests that all members of the LRRC8 family, which are on average 45.92% identical, may have a similar function (2Abascal F. Zardoya R. LRRC8 proteins share a common ancestor with pannexins, and may form hexameric channels involved in cell-cell communication.Bioessays. 2012; 34: 551-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). LRRC8A was initially proposed to be a cell surface receptor that initiates a signaling cascade in response to the binding of an extracellular ligand important for B cell development (3Sawada A. Takihara Y. Kim J.Y. Matsuda-Hashii Y. Tokimasa S. Fujisaki H. Kubota K. Endo H. Onodera T. Ohta H. Ozono K. Hara J. A congenital mutation of the novel gene LRRC8 causes agammaglobulinemia in humans.J. Clin. Invest. 2003; 112: 1707-1713Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). In light of our results, it is possible that instead of acting as a receptor, LRRC8A may act as a selective communication channel that mediates the import of a growth and/or differentiation factor secreted by nearby cells to allow continuation of B cell development. A similar mechanism may be at play for LRRC8C in adipocyte differentiation. Contrary to what was reporter earlier, the LRR domains of LRRC8A and LRRC8D face the cytoplasm (3Sawada A. Takihara Y. Kim J.Y. Matsuda-Hashii Y. Tokimasa S. Fujisaki H. Kubota K. Endo H. Onodera T. Ohta H. Ozono K. Hara J. A congenital mutation of the novel gene LRRC8 causes agammaglobulinemia in humans.J. Clin. Invest. 2003; 112: 1707-1713Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The topology inferred from our experiments is consistent with that of pannexins (2Abascal F. Zardoya R. LRRC8 proteins share a common ancestor with pannexins, and may form hexameric channels involved in cell-cell communication.Bioessays. 2012; 34: 551-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that LRRC8s are the evolutionary result of the combination of a pannexin and a LRR domain (2Abascal F. Zardoya R. LRRC8 proteins share a common ancestor with pannexins, and may form hexameric channels involved in cell-cell communication.Bioessays. 2012; 34: 551-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). What could be the added benefit of the LRR domain? It is unclear whether LRRC8 channels are always open or if they selectively open when needed. Perhaps the LRR domain regulates the opening of the channel through an interaction with a protein or molecule that occurs in response to specific cellular needs. Alternatively, the LRR domain could bind to additional proteins that make up the scaffold of the transporter, or it could recruit proteins that interact with incoming or outgoing substrates. We discovered that LRRC8D interacts in stable fashion with other members of the LRRC8 family. Obviously, proteins that interact transiently or only under certain ligand-stimulated conditions would have been missed in our experimental conditions. In addition to future searches for such interactors, it would also be interesting to identify interactions that depend upon the LRR domain by comparing immunoprecipitates from full-length LRRC8s and LRRC8s missing their LRR domain. Panx1 oligomerizes into hexamers whereas Panx2 is thought to assemble into heptamers or octamers (7Penuela S. Gehi R. Laird D.W. The biochemistry and function of pannexin channels.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2013; 1828: 15-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Some intermixing between Panx1, Panx2, and Panx3 has been observed, but the biological significance of this is currently unknown. It will be important to determine in future studies whether LRRC8s interact with each other in a single complex or if there are multiple complexes of distinct stoichiometry and composition. While this work was under review, two recent publications established a plausible role for LRRC8A as a volume-regulated anion channel (19Qiu Z. Dubin A.E. Mathur J. Tu B. Reddy K. Miraglia L.J.

The proposed topology reported in our work is entirely consistent with that proposed by Voss et al. (20Voss F.K. Ullrich F. Münch J. Lazarow K. Lutter D. Mah N. Andrade-Navarro M.A. Kries von J.P.

The enzyme is involved in the resynthesis of digested triacylglycerol (TAG), catalyzing the esterification of monoacylglycerol (MAG).

Consistent with the concept that intestinal fat metabolism regulates energy balance, MGAT2 enhances systemic metabolic efficiency. Mice with a deletion of the gene encoding the enzyme (Mogat2−/−) are protected from obesity and associated metabolic disorders induced by high fat feeding (14Yen C.L. Cheong M.L. Grueter C. Zhou P.

Deficiency of the intestinal enzyme acyl CoA:monoacylglycerol acyltransferase-2 protects mice from metabolic disorders induced by high-fat feeding.Nat. Med. 2009; 15: 442-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Despite the putative role of MGAT2 in fat absorption, Mogat2−/− mice consume and absorb normal amounts of dietary fat. Interestingly, they exhibit an increase in energy expenditure. This difference is exacerbated with high fat feeding, but the increase in energy expenditure persists even when the mice are fed a fat-free diet (15Nelson D.W. Gao Y. Spencer N.M. Banh T. Yen C.L.

Med. 2009; 15: 442-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Recently, we found that reintroducing MGAT2 expression exclusively in the small intestine is not sufficient to restore metabolic efficiency in Mogat2−/− mice completely (16Gao Y. Nelson D.W. Banh T. Yen M.I. Yen C.L. Intestine-specific expression of MOGAT2 partially restores metabolic efficiency in Mogat2-deficient mice.J. Lipid Res. 2013; 54: 1644-1652Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), implicating a role of extraintestinal MGAT2 in modulating energy balance. To test the hypothesis that intestinal MGAT2 is necessary for maximizing metabolic efficiency, in this study, we examined whether inactivating MGAT2 exclusively in the small intestine protects mice from excessive accretion of body fat and associated comorbidities induced by high fat feeding. To generate mice lacking Mogat2 specifically in the small intestine, embryonic stem cells bearing a targeted Mogat2 allele were obtained from the Knockout Mouse Project (KOMP) repository (EPD0093_1_A12), injected into blastocysts, and implanted into pseudopregnant mice. The offspring (C57BL/6N-Mogat2tm1a(KOMP)Wtsi) carry a trapping cassette “SA-geo-pA” flanked by the flippase (FLP) recombinase target (FRT) sites upstream from exon 2 of the Mogat2 allele (Fig. 1A, Mogat2 Targeted). After crossing with a mouse (B6.Cg-Tg(ACTFLPe)9205Dym/J) expressing the FLP1 recombinase under the control of the human β-actin promoter (The Jackson Laboratory) to excise the trapping cassette, offspring carrying a “floxed” Mogat2 allele with exon 2 flanked by Cre recombinase target sites (loxP) were produced. Mice possessing the floxed Mogat2 allele without the FLP1 gene (Mogat2f/f) in the C57BL/6 genetic background were then produced through intercrossing. Next, Mogat2f/f mice were bred with a mouse expressing the Cre transgene under the control of the mouse villin 1 promoter (B6.SJL-Tg(Vil-cre)997Gum/J; The Jackson Laboratory), which drives expression in all four types of intestinal epithelia beginning by postcoital day 12.5 (17Pinto D. Robine S. Jaisser F. El Marjou F.E. Louvard D. Regulatory sequences of the mouse villin gene that efficiently drive transgenic expression in immature and differentiated epithelial cells of small and large intestines.J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6476-6482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar); through intercrossing, mice with an intestine-specific deletion of Mogat2 (Mogat2IKO mice) were produced. For experiments, Mogat2f/f mice were bred with Mogat2IKO mice to produce Mogat2IKO and Mogat2f/f littermate controls. To generate mice deficient in MGAT2 in all tissues, Mogat2+/− mice were also bred to produce Mogat2−/− and wild type littermate controls as described (14Yen C.L. Cheong M.L. Grueter C. Zhou P. Moriwaki J. Wong J.S. Hubbard B. Marmor S. Farese Jr., R.V. Deficiency of the intestinal enzyme acyl CoA:monoacylglycerol acyltransferase-2 protects mice from metabolic disorders induced by high-fat feeding.Nat. Med. 2009; 15: 442-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Differences in metabolic phenotypes were most pronounced in males; therefore, adult male mice were used for experiments. Female mice were used in a few key experiments as indicated to verify whether the effects were sex-dependent. Mice were housed at 22 °C on a 12-h light, 12-h dark cycle. Weighing of mice and changes of diets and cages were performed between 3 and 6 p.m. All animal procedures were approved by the University of Wisconsin-Madison Animal Care and Use Committee and were conducted in conformity with the Public Health Service Policy on Humane Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. Genotypes of mice were determined by PCR. To determine the presence of the Cre recombinase transgene, the following four primers were used: Cre forward, 5′-CCCGGCAAAACAGGTAGTTA-3′; Cre reverse, 5′-TGCCAGGATCAGGGTTAAG-3′; positive control forward, 5′-CCTTTAGCCTGGTCTAGGCAGAG-3′; and positive control reverse, 5′-CAGCAAAGCCCCCTCCTGAATCTCTC-3′. This reaction produces a 194-bp amplicon and a 381-bp amplicon from the transgene and the internal control gene, respectively. To determine the presence of the wild type or floxed Mogat2 allele, the following two primers were used: M2 forward, 5′-GTATGCCACCTGGTGGTAC-3′; and M2 reverse, 5′-GCAGTCCTATACCAGTACAG-3′. This reaction produces a 478-bp amplicon and a 512-bp amplicon from the wild type allele and the allele with the addition of a 34-bp loxP site, respectively. Mice were fed a complete, fixed formula chow (8604, Teklad, Madison, WI). A series of semipurified (defined) diets containing 10, 45, or 60% calories from fat (D12450B, D12451, and D12492, Research Diets, New Brunswick, NJ) were used to examine the effect of dietary fat, replacing refined carbohydrate, on food intake and energy expenditure in metabolic chambers and during long term feeding experiments. These defined diets contained 20% calories from protein (casein) and fixed amounts of micronutrients and fiber per calorie, but they varied in metabolizable energy (3.8, 4.7, or 5.2 kcal/g, corresponding to the fat content). To assess the levels of Mogat2 mRNA, tissues from age-matched mice fed a 10 or 60 kcal % fat diet for 12–16 weeks were homogenized, and total RNA was extracted with the AurumTM Total RNA Mini kit (Bio-Rad) and purified by on-column digestion of DNA with DNase I to eliminate residual genomic DNA. Total RNA was used for cDNA synthesis (iScriptTM cDNA synthesis kit, Bio-Rad). Real time quantitative PCR was performed with iTaqTM SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad) and analyzed with the ABI PRISM® 7000 Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems, Grand Island, NJ). Relative expression levels were calculated by the comparative CT (cycle of threshold detection) method as outlined in the manufacturer's technical bulletin. Cyclophilin B (Cypb) expression was used as an internal control. The primer sequences of the Cypb gene were 5′-TGCCGGAGTCGACAATGAT-3′ (forward) and 5′-TGGAAGAGCACCAAGACAGACA-3′ (reverse). The primers to detect Mogat2 mRNAs were located on exon 1 and exon 2, respectively; the primer sequences were 5′-TGGGAGCGCAGGTTACAGA-3′ (forward) and 5′-CAGGTGGCATACAGGACAGA-3′ (reverse). The 2−ΔΔCt method was used to calculate the -fold change in gene expression (18Livak K.J. Schmittgen T.D. Analysis of relative gene expression data using real-time quantitative PCR and the 2(-Delta Delta C(T)) Method.Methods. 2001; 25: 402-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (123424) Google Scholar). MGAT activity assays were performed with total tissue homogenates as described previously (11Yen C.L. Farese Jr., R.V. MGAT2, a monoacylglycerol acyltransferase expressed in the small intestine.J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 18532-18537Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Reactions were started by adding homogenates to the assay mixture and stopped after 5 min by adding chloroform:methanol (2:1, v/v). The lipids were extracted, dried, and separated by thin-layer chromatography (TLC) on silica gel G-60 plates with the solvent system hexane:diethyl ether:acetic acid (80:20:1, v/v/v). Lipid bands were visualized with iodine vapor, and products were identified by comparison with the migration of lipid standards. The incorporation of radioactive substrates into lipid products was also visualized by an imaging scanner (Typhoon FLA 7000, GE Healthcare) followed by scraping and counting in a scintillation counter (Packard Tri-Carb 2200 CA liquid scintillation counter analyzer). To examine the uptake and processing of MAG, micelles containing radiolabeled tracers were injected into ligated intestine pouches created in anesthetized mice. Taurocholate micelles were prepared with 2-mono-[U-14C]oleoyl-racemic glycerol (∼15 Ci/mol; American Radiolabeled Chemicals, St. Louis, MO) and unlabeled oleate, and isolated pouches in both the proximal and distal intestine were created as described previously (16Gao Y. Nelson D.W. Banh T. Yen M.I. Yen C.L. Intestine-specific expression of MOGAT2 partially restores metabolic efficiency in Mogat2-deficient mice.J.

Metabolism of apical versus basolateral sn-2-monoacylglycerol and fatty acids in rodent small intestine.J. Lipid Res. 2008; 49: 1762-1769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Two minutes after the micelle preparation was injected, the proximal and distal small intestinal pouches were excised. The luminal content was washed out with 10 mm taurocholate in PBS and collected. Lipids from the proximal small intestine and the distal small intestine were extracted with chloroform:methanol (2:1, v/v) and separated by TLC using a two-solvent system (first by chloroform:acetone:methanol:acetic acid:water (50:20:10:10:5, v/v/v/v/v) and then by hexane:diethyl ether:acetic acid (80:20:1, v/v/v)). The bands corresponding to TAG, DAG, and MAG were scraped after iodine staining and transferred into scintillation vials for counting of radioactivity. To examine the anatomical distribution of lipid absorption, we intragastrically challenged mice with a radiolabeled lipid bolus and assessed the levels of radioactivity along the length of the small intestine. Briefly, mice were acclimated to 60 kcal % fat diet for at least 1 week, fasted for 4 h, and then gavaged with 2 μCi of tri-[carboxyl-14C]oleoylglycerol ([14C]TAG; American Radiolabeled Chemicals) in 200 μl of olive oil. After 2 h, the entire gastrointestinal tract was excised. The small intestine was rinsed and cut into 2-cm sections. Each section was digested overnight in 500 μl of 1 n NaOH at 65 °C. Radioactivity was counted after adding 4 ml of Optima Gold scintillation mixture (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) in a scintillation counter. To assess the temporal distribution, the rate at which dietary fat entered circulation, mice acclimatized to high fat feeding for 1 week were fasted for 6 h and injected with 500 mg/kg surfactant Pluronic F127 NF Prill Poloxamer 407 (a gift from BASF Corp., Florham Park, NJ) to inhibit the clearance of plasma TAG. Ten minutes later, mice were intragastrically challenged with 200 μl of olive oil containing 2 μCi of [14C]TAG. Blood was collected before (time 0) and at the indicated times for TAG measurement and scintillation counting. Plasma TAG was measured by enzymatic assay (InfinityTM Triglycerides Lipid Stable Reagent, Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Middletown, VA). To determine postprandial GLP-1 and GIP levels in circulation, mice acclimatized to high fat feeding for 1–2 weeks were fasted for 4 h and then challenged with an intragastric bolus of 300 μl of mixed meal (Ensure® supplemented with olive oil) containing 0.65 kcal and 42 mg of fat. Plasma was collected 2 h later in the presence of 100 μm dipeptidyl-peptidase IV inhibitor (EMD Millipore Corp., Billerica, MA). GLP-1 and GIP levels in plasma were assessed using total GLP-1 and GIP ELISA kits (Millipore). To assess phenotypes related to energy balance, mice were housed in a metabolic phenotyping system with housing and wood chip bedding similar to the home cage environment (LabMaster modular animal monitoring system; TSE Systems, Chesterfield, MO). Male mice (3 months old) were acclimated to individual housing and metabolic cages for 1 week before experiments and fed the indicated diets sequentially for 3 days each and high fat diet for up to 2 additional weeks. Data collection and analysis were performed as reported previously (15Nelson D.W. Gao Y. Spencer N.M. Banh T. Yen C.L.

A subset of mice was housed continuously in the metabolic cages for 3 weeks to collect longitudinal food intake data in the metabolic chambers. Food intake after acclimation to high fat feeding was also examined in an independent cohort of mice in standard cages. To examine the effects of the interaction between diet and MGAT2 on long term energy balance, mice were fed a regular mixed meal chow at weaning (3 weeks), switched from chow to a 60 or 10 kcal % fat diet at 12 weeks of age, and weighed weekly for 10 weeks. Female mice were switched from chow to high fat diet at 10 months of age and weighed weekly for 10 weeks. Following high fat feeding, tissues and plasma were harvested for weighing and biochemical assays. Hepatic and fecal lipids were extracted using the method of Folch et al. (20Folch J. Lees M. Sloane Stanley G.H. A simple method for the isolation and purification of total lipides from animal tissues.J. Biol. Chem. 1957; 226: 497-509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Samples were homogenized in PBS and extracted in chloroform:methanol (2:1, v/v). After repeating the extraction, the organic phases were combined, dried, and weighed in a new glass vial. To determine the amount of TAG, free fatty acids, and cholesterol in these extracts, samples were resuspended in 1 ml of chloroform containing 1% Triton X-100, evaporated to dryness, resuspended in 1 ml of H2O, and assayed using enzymatic kits (Infinity Triglycerides Lipid Stable Reagent, Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.; Cholesterol E, Non-Esterified Fatty Acid assay, Wako Diagnostics). Protein concentration was measured by the bicinchoninic acid assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.). Hepatic glycogen contents were determined as described (21Doi R. Oishi K. Ishida N. CLOCK regulates circadian rhythms of hepatic glycogen synthesis through transcriptional activation of Gys2.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 22114-22121Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Fecal samples were collected from individually housed mice acclimatized to the 60 kcal % fat diet for 1 week. To examine glucose metabolism prior to high fat feeding, chow-fed mice aged 3 months were bled after a 6-h fast for blood glucose and plasma insulin measurement. To examine glucose metabolism following high fat feeding, mice were fed a 60 kcal % fat diet for 8–11 weeks, and then a glucose tolerance test was performed. Briefly, male mice were fasted for 6 h beginning at 7 a.m. and then injected with glucose (1 g/kg of body weight, intraperitoneal, 10% glucose in PBS). Blood glucose was measured immediately before and at defined intervals after glucose injection using a hand-held glucometer (OneTouch Ultra, LifeScan, Inc., Milpitas, CA). Insulin was measured by ELISA (Crystal Chem, Inc., Downers Grove, IL). All data are presented as mean ± S.E. p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Each experiment was performed with independent samples at least twice to confirm reproducibility of the results. For comparisons between two groups, Student's t tests were used. For comparisons between four groups, a one-way analysis of variance followed by Tukey's multiple comparison test was used. Differences measured over time were compared using repeated measures two-way analysis of variance to determine the main effects of and interactions between time and genotype. Analyses were conducted using GraphPad Prism statistical analysis software (version 5.01; GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA). To examine the effects of inactivating MGAT2 specifically in the intestine, we introduced a Cre recombinase under the control of the intestine-specific villin promoter into Mogat2f/f mice, which carry two loxP sites flanking exon 2 of the Mogat2 gene (Fig. 1A), as described under “Experimental Procedures.” All of the offspring were born with floxed Mogat2 alleles, and half expressed the tissue-specific Cre enzyme. To confirm the efficiency and tissue specificity of MGAT2 ablation in the Cre-expressing floxed mice (Mogat2IKO), we measured the MGAT2 mRNA expression level and MGAT activity in several tissues, including the small intestine, kidney, and white and brown adipose tissue, where MGAT2 expression has been reported (11Yen C.L. Farese Jr., R.V. MGAT2, a monoacylglycerol acyltransferase expressed in the small intestine.J. Biol.

MGAT2, a monoacylglycerol acyltransferase expressed in the small intestine.J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 18532-18537Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). We found that Mogat2f/f mice expressed MGAT2 mRNA at levels similar to that found in wild type mice. In both groups, MGAT2 was expressed predominantly in the intestine when mice were fed either a high fat (Fig. 1B) or a low fat (data not shown) diet, and the intestinal expression levels were up-regulated more than 5-fold upon high fat feeding. Mogat2−/− mice had no detectable MGAT2 mRNA in any tissue examined. In contrast, Mogat2IKO mice showed MGAT2 expression levels similar to those of Mogat2f/f littermates in examined tissues except in the small intestine where MGAT2 expression remained absent even after the continuous renewal of intestinal epithelia. Mice in all four groups had no detectable MGAT2 mRNA in liver (data not shown), indicating that lacking MGAT2 specifically in the intestine does not induce hepatic MGAT2 expression in adult mice. The levels of MGAT activity correlated with the levels of MGAT2 mRNA detected. With the highest levels found in the intestine, Mogat2f/f mice showed MGAT activity similar to that of wild type mice. Ablation of MGAT2 message in the intestine of Mogat2IKO mice reduced intestinal MGAT activity by ∼70% as compared with Mogat2f/f mice (Fig. 1C). This difference in MGAT activity was similar to that seen between Mogat2−/− and wild type mice. The levels of MGAT activity were low in all other tissues examined. In these tissues, the differences between wild type and Mogat2−/− mice were statistically significant, whereas the differences between Mogat2f/f and Mogat2IKO mice were not. These results indicated that Mogat2IKO mice are deficient in MGAT2 specifically in the intestine. Mogat2−/− mice exhibit reduced MAG uptake and esterification in the intestine (16Gao Y. Nelson D.W. Banh T. Yen M.I. Yen C.L. Intestine-specific expression of MOGAT2 partially restores metabolic efficiency in Mogat2-deficient mice.J. Lipid Res. 2013; 54: 1644-1652Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). To confirm that deletion of MGAT2 in the intestine impairs MAG uptake and esterification, we infused taurocholate micelles containing fatty acids and 2-mono-[U-14C]oleoyl-racemic glycerol directly into ligated pouches created in both the proximal and distal intestine. After a 2-min incubation, ∼45% of the label injected was taken up and accumulated in the proximal intestine segment of wild type mice (Fig. 2A), whereas less than 1% of label appeared in the circulation with the rest still in the lumen (data not shown). A similar level of accumulation was found in Mogat2f/f mice. In contrast, less than 10% of MAG tracer was taken up in the proximal intestine of Mogat2−/− mice and likewise in Mogat2IKO mice. In"

https://openalex.org/W2076754613,"Notch signaling is involved in cell fate choices during the embryonic development of Metazoa. Commonly, Notch signaling arises from the binding of the Notch receptor to its ligands in adjacent cells driving cell-to-cell communication. Yet, cell-autonomous control of Notch signaling through both ligand-dependent and ligand-independent mechanisms is known to occur as well. Examples include Notch signaling arising in the absence of ligand binding, and cis-inhibition of Notch signaling by titration of the Notch receptor upon binding to its ligands within a single cell. Increasing experimental evidences support that the binding of the Notch receptor with its ligands within a cell (cis-interactions) can also trigger a cell-autonomous Notch signal (cis-signaling), whose potential effects on cell fate decisions and patterning remain poorly understood. To address this question, herein we mathematically and computationally investigate the cell states arising from the combination of cis-signaling with additional Notch signaling sources, which are either cell-autonomous or involve cell-to-cell communication. Our study shows that cis-signaling can switch from driving cis-activation to effectively perform cis-inhibition and identifies under which conditions this switch occurs. This switch relies on the competition between Notch signaling sources, which share the same receptor but differ in their signaling efficiency. We propose that the role of cis-interactions and their signaling on fine-grained patterning and cell fate decisions is dependent on whether they drive cis-inhibition or cis-activation, which could be controlled during development. Specifically, cis-inhibition and not cis-activation facilitates patterning and enriches it by modulating the ratio of cells in the high-ligand expression state, by enabling additional periodic patterns like stripes and by allowing localized patterning highly sensitive to the precursor state and cell-autonomous bistability. Our study exemplifies the complexity of regulations when multiple signaling sources share the same receptor and provides the tools for their characterization."
https://openalex.org/W1983308749,"Adipose tissue expansion requires growth and proliferation of adipocytes and the concomitant expansion of their stromovascular network. We have used an ex vivo angiogenesis assay to study the mechanisms involved in adipose tissue expansion. In this assay, adipose tissue fragments placed under pro-angiogenic conditions form sprouts composed of endothelial, perivascular, and other proliferative cells. We find that sprouting was directly stimulated by insulin and was enhanced by prior treatment of mice with the insulin sensitizer rosiglitazone. Moreover, basal and insulin-stimulated sprouting increased progressively over 30 weeks of high fat diet feeding, correlating with tissue expansion during this period. cDNA microarrays analyzed to identify genes correlating with insulin-stimulated sprouting surprisingly revealed only four positively correlating (Fads3, Tmsb10, Depdc6, and Rasl12) and four negatively correlating (Asph, IGFbp4, Ppm1b, and Adcyap1r1) genes. Among the proteins encoded by these genes, IGFbp4, which suppresses IGF-1 signaling, has been previously implicated in angiogenesis, suggesting a role for IGF-1 in adipose tissue expandability. Indeed, IGF-1 potently stimulated sprouting, and the presence of activated IGF-1 receptors in the vasculature was revealed by immunostaining. Recombinant IGFbp4 blocked the effects of insulin and IGF-1 on mouse adipose tissue sprouting and also suppressed sprouting from human subcutaneous adipose tissue. These results reveal an important role of IGF-1/IGFbp4 signaling in post-developmental adipose tissue expansion."
https://openalex.org/W1965874548,"Background The Bradykinesia Akinesia Incoordination (BRAIN) test is a computer keyboard-tapping task that was developed for use in assessing the effect of symptomatic treatment on motor function in Parkinson's disease (PD). An online version has now been designed for use in a wider clinical context and the research setting. Methods Validation of the online BRAIN test was undertaken in 58 patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) and 93 age-matched, non-neurological controls. Kinesia scores (KS30, number of key taps in 30 seconds), akinesia times (AT30, mean dwell time on each key in milliseconds), incoordination scores (IS30, variance of travelling time between key presses) and dysmetria scores (DS30, accuracy of key presses) were compared between groups. These parameters were correlated against total motor scores and sub-scores from the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS). Results Mean KS30, AT30 and IS30 were significantly different between PD patients and controls (p≤0.0001). Sensitivity for 85% specificity was 50% for KS30, 40% for AT30 and 29% for IS30. KS30, AT30 and IS30 correlated significantly with UPDRS total motor scores (r = −0.53, r = 0.27 and r = 0.28 respectively) and motor UPDRS sub-scores. The reliability of KS30, AT30 and DS30 was good on repeated testing. Conclusions The BRAIN test is a reliable, convenient test of upper limb motor function that can be used routinely in the outpatient clinic, at home and in clinical trials. In addition, it can be used as an objective longitudinal measurement of emerging motor dysfunction for the prediction of PD in at-risk cohorts."
https://openalex.org/W2090272372,"In this paper, we demonstrate a comprehensive method for segmenting the retinal vasculature in camera images of the fundus. This is of interest in the area of diagnostics for eye diseases that affect the blood vessels in the eye. In a departure from other state-of-the-art methods, vessels are first pre-grouped together with graph partitioning, using a spectral clustering technique based on morphological features. Local curvature is estimated over the whole image using eigenvalues of Hessian matrix in order to enhance the vessels, which appear as ridges in images of the retina. The result is combined with a binarized image, obtained using a threshold that maximizes entropy, to extract the retinal vessels from the background. Speckle type noise is reduced by applying a connectivity constraint on the extracted curvature based enhanced image. This constraint is varied over the image according to each region's predominant blood vessel size. The resultant image exhibits the central light reflex of retinal arteries and veins, which prevents the segmentation of whole vessels. To address this, the earlier entropy-based binarization technique is repeated on the original image, but crucially, with a different threshold to incorporate the central reflex vessels. The final segmentation is achieved by combining the segmented vessels with and without central light reflex. We carry out our approach on DRIVE and REVIEW, two publicly available collections of retinal images for research purposes. The obtained results are compared with state-of-the-art methods in the literature using metrics such as sensitivity (true positive rate), selectivity (false positive rate) and accuracy rates for the DRIVE images and measured vessel widths for the REVIEW images. Our approach out-performs the methods in the literature."
https://openalex.org/W2041618384,"Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a common yet complex retinal degeneration that causes irreversible central blindness in the elderly. Pathology is widely believed to follow loss of retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and photoreceptor degeneration. Here we report aberrant expression of interleukin-17A (IL17A) and the receptor IL17RC in the macula of AMD patients. In vitro, IL17A induces RPE cell death characterized by the accumulation of cytoplasmic lipids and autophagosomes with subsequent activation of pro-apoptotic Caspase-3 and Caspase-9. This pathology is reduced by siRNA knockdown of IL17RC. IL17-dependent retinal degeneration in a mouse model of focal retinal degeneration can be prevented by gene therapy with adeno-associated virus vector encoding soluble IL17 receptor.

In this work we identify a physical and functional poly(ADP-ribose)-mediated interaction of PARP1 with the E3 ubiquitin ligase UHRF1 (also known as NP95, ICBP90) that influences two UHRF1-regulated cellular processes. On the one hand, we uncovered a cooperative interplay between PARP1 and UHRF1 in the accumulation of the heterochromatin repressive mark H4K20me3. The absence of PARP1 led to reduced accumulation of H4K20me3 onto pericentric heterochromatin that coincided with abnormally enhanced transcription. The loss of H4K20me3 was rescued by the additional depletion of UHRF1. In contrast, although PARP1 also seemed to facilitate the association of UHRF1 with DNMT1, its absence did not impair the loading of DNMT1 onto heterochromatin or the methylation of pericentric regions, possibly owing to a compensating interaction of DNMT1 with PCNA. On the other hand, we showed that PARP1 controls the UHRF1-mediated ubiquitination of DNMT1 to timely regulate its abundance during S and G2 phase. Together, this report identifies PARP1 as a novel modulator of two UHRF1-regulated heterochromatin-associated events: the accumulation of H4K20me3 and the clearance of DNMT1."
https://openalex.org/W2164255675,"The adipokine chemerin and its receptor, chemokine-like receptor 1 (Cmklr1), are associated with insulin resistance and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), which covers a broad spectrum of liver diseases, ranging from simple steatosis to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). It is possible that chemerin and/or Cmklr1 exert their effects on these disorders through inflammation, but so far the data have been controversial. To gain further insight into this matter, we studied the effect of whole-body Cmklr1 deficiency on insulin resistance and NAFLD. In view of the primary role of macrophages in hepatic inflammation, we also transplanted bone marrow from Cmklr1 knock-out (Cmklr1-/-) mice and wild type (WT) mice into low-density lipoprotein receptor knock-out (Ldlr-/-) mice, a mouse model for NASH. All mice were fed a high fat, high cholesterol diet containing 21% fat from milk butter and 0.2% cholesterol for 12 weeks. Insulin resistance was assessed by an oral glucose tolerance test, an insulin tolerance test, and by measurement of plasma glucose and insulin levels. Liver pathology was determined by measuring hepatic inflammation, fibrosis, lipid accumulation and the NAFLD activity score (NAS). Whole-body Cmklr1 deficiency did not affect body weight gain or food intake. In addition, we observed no differences between WT and Cmklr1-/- mice for hepatic inflammatory and fibrotic gene expression, immune cell infiltration, lipid accumulation or NAS. In line with this, we detected no differences in insulin resistance. In concordance with whole-body Cmklr1 deficiency, the absence of Cmklr1 in bone marrow-derived cells in Ldlr-/- mice did not affect their insulin resistance or liver pathology. Our results indicate that Cmklr1 is not involved in the pathogenesis of insulin resistance or NAFLD. Thus, we recommend that the associations reported between Cmklr1 and insulin resistance or NAFLD should be interpreted with caution."
https://openalex.org/W2007162732,"While behavioral sex differences have repeatedly been reported across taxa, the underlying epigenetic mechanisms in the brain are mostly lacking. Birds have previously shown to have only limited dosage compensation, leading to high sex bias of Z-chromosome gene expression. In chickens, a male hyper-methylated region (MHM) on the Z-chromosome has been associated with a local type of dosage compensation, but a more detailed characterization of the avian methylome is limiting our interpretations. Here we report an analysis of genome wide sex differences in promoter DNA-methylation and gene expression in the brain of three weeks old chickens, and associated sex differences in behavior of Red Junglefowl (ancestor of domestic chickens). Combining DNA-methylation tiling arrays with gene expression microarrays we show that a specific locus of the MHM region, together with the promoter for the zinc finger RNA binding protein (ZFR) gene on chromosome 1, is strongly associated with sex dimorphism in gene expression. Except for this, we found few differences in promoter DNA-methylation, even though hundreds of genes were robustly differentially expressed across distantly related breeds. Several of the differentially expressed genes are known to affect behavior, and as suggested from their functional annotation, we found that female Red Junglefowl are more explorative and fearful in a range of tests performed throughout their lives. This paper identifies new sites and, with increased resolution, confirms known sites where DNA-methylation seems to affect sexually dimorphic gene expression, but the general lack of this association is noticeable and strengthens the view that birds do not have dosage compensation."
https://openalex.org/W2038594194,"A key event in chronic allergic asthma is the TGF-β-induced activation of fibroblasts into α-SMA-positive myofibroblasts which synthesize type-I collagen. In the present study we investigated the effect of the anti-fibrotic molecule BMP-7 in asthma. Balb/c mice were immunized i.p. with ovalbumin in alum and challenged every 2 days with ovalbumin aerosol (two or six challenges for acute and chronic protocols, respectively). The lung was evaluated for: α-SMA and type-I collagen by immunohistochemistry; BMP-7 and TGF- β1 gene expression by qRT-PCR; type-I collagen and Smads 2 and 3 by immunoblotting; mucus by PSA staining. Type-I collagen around bronchi, α-SMA, mucus secretion, TGF- β1 and BMP-7 gene expression were all increased in asthma. The TGF- β1/BMP-7 ratio was higher in the chronic group and correlated with higher levels of collagen. Fibroblasts isolated from asthmatic and healthy lungs produced type-I collagen upon stimulation with TGF- β1 via phosphorylation of Smad-2, Smad-3. Pre-treatment of the fibroblasts with BMP-7 reduced collagen production and Smads phosphorylation. Intranasal treatment of asthmatic mice with recombinant BMP-7 during the immunization protocol reduced lung inflammation and type I collagen deposition. These results suggest a protective role for BMP-7 in lung allergic inflammation, opposing the pro-fibrotic effects of TGF- β1."
https://openalex.org/W1987626466,"The main hypothesis suggested that changes in the external mechanical load would lead to different deformations of the submembranous cytoskeleton and, as a result, dissociation of different proteins from its structure (induced by increased/decreased mechanical stress). The study subjects were fibers of the soleus muscle and cardiomyocytes of Wistar rats. Changes in external mechanical conditions were reconstructed by means of antiorthostatic suspension of the animals by their tails for 6, 12, 18, 24 and 72 hours. Transversal stiffness was measured by atomic force microscopy imaging; beta-, gamma-actin, alpha-actinin 1 and alpha-actinin 4 levels in membranous and cytoplasmic fractions were quantified by Western blot analysis; expression rates of the corresponding genes were studied using RT-PCR. Results: In 6 hours, alpha-actinin 1 and alpha-actinin 4 levels decreased in the membranous fraction of proteins of cardiomyocytes and soleus muscle fibers, respectively, but increased in the cytoplasmic fraction of the abovementioned cells. After 6–12 hours of suspension, the expression rates of beta-, gamma-actin, alpha-actinin 1 and alpha-actinin 4 were elevated in the soleus muscle fibers, but the alpha-actinin 1 expression rate returned to the reference level in 72 hours. After 18–24 hours, the expression rates of beta-actin and alpha-actinin 4 increased in cardiomyocytes, while the alpha-actinin 1 expression rate decreased in soleus muscle fibers. After 12 hours, the beta- and gamma-actin content dropped in the membranous fraction and increased in the cytoplasmic protein fractions from both cardiomyocytes and soleus muscle fibers. The stiffness of both cell types decreased after the same period of time. Further, during the unloading period the concentration of nonmuscle actin and different isoforms of alpha-actinins increased in the membranous fraction from cardiomyocytes. At the same time, the concentration of the abovementioned proteins decreased in the soleus muscle fibers."
https://openalex.org/W2074177081,"Background The Baltic/Wadden Sea eider Somateria mollissima flyway population is decreasing, and this trend is also reflected in the large eider colony at Christiansø situated in the Baltic Sea. This colony showed a 15-fold increase from 1925 until the mid-1990's, followed by a rapid decline in recent years, although the causes of this trend remain unknown. Most birds from the colony winter in the Wadden Sea, from which environmental data and information on the size of the main diet, the mussel Mytilus edulis stock exists. We hypothesised that changes in nutrients and water temperature in the Wadden Sea had an effect on the ecosystem affecting the size of mussel stocks, the principal food item for eiders, thereby influencing the number of breeding eider in the Christiansø colony. Methodology/Principal Finding A positive relationship between the amount of fertilizer used by farmers and the concentration of phosphorus in the Wadden Sea (with a time lag of one year) allowed analysis of the predictions concerning effects of nutrients for the period 1925–2010. There was (1) increasing amounts of fertilizer used in agriculture and this increased the amount of nutrients in the marine environment thereby increasing the mussel stocks in the Wadden Sea. (2) The number of eiders at Christiansø increased when the amount of fertilizer increased. Finally (3) the number of eiders in the colony at Christiansø increased with the amount of mussel stocks in the Wadden Sea. Conclusions/Significance The trend in the number of eiders at Christiansø is representative for the entire flyway population, and since nutrient reduction in the marine environment occurs in most parts of Northwest Europe, we hypothesize that this environmental candidate parameter is involved in the overall regulation of the Baltic/Wadden Sea eider population during recent decades."
https://openalex.org/W2053073084,"Desmosomal cadherins are transmembrane adhesion molecules that provide cell adhesion by interacting in the intercellular space of adjacent cells. In keratinocytes, several desmoglein (Dsg1-4) and desmocollin (Dsc1-3) isoforms are coexpressed. We have shown previously that Dsg2 is less important for keratinocyte cohesion compared with Dsg3 and that the latter forms a complex with p38 MAPK. In this study, we compared the involvement of Dsg2 and Dsg3 in the p38 MAPK-dependent regulation of keratinocyte cohesion. We show that loss of cell adhesion and keratin filament retraction induced by Dsg3 depletion is ameliorated by specific p38 MAPK inhibition. Furthermore, in contrast to depletion of Dsg2, siRNA-mediated silencing of Dsg3 induced p38 MAPK activation, which is in line with immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrating the interaction of activated p38 MAPK with Dsg3 but not with Dsg2. Cell fractionation into a cytoskeleton-unbound and a cytoskeleton-anchored desmosome-containing pool revealed that Dsg3, in contrast to Dsg2, is present in relevant amounts in the unbound pool in which activated p38 MAPK is predominantly detectable. Moreover, because loss of cell adhesion by Dsg3 depletion was partially rescued by p38 MAPK inhibition, we conclude that, besides its function as an adhesion molecule, Dsg3 is strengthening cell cohesion via modulation of p38 MAPK-dependent keratin filament reorganization. Nevertheless, because subsequent targeting of Dsg3 in Dsg2-depleted cells led to drastically enhanced keratinocyte dissociation and Dsg2 was enhanced at the membrane in Dsg3 knockout cells, we conclude that Dsg2 compensates for Dsg3 loss of function."
https://openalex.org/W2092378745,"Pituitary adenomas (PAs) are neoplasms that may cause a variety of neurological and endocrine effects. Although known causal contributors include heredity, hormonal influence and somatic mutations, the pathophysiologic mechanisms driving tumorigenesis and invasion of sporadic PAs remain unknown. We hypothesized that alterations in DNA methylation are associated with PA invasion and histopathology subtype, and that genome-scale methylation analysis may complement current classification methods for sporadic PAs. Twenty-four surgically-resected sporadic PAs with varying histopathological subtypes were assigned dichotomized Knosp invasion scores and examined using genome-wide DNA methylation profiling and RNA sequencing. PA samples clustered into subgroups according to functional status. Compared with hormonally-active PAs, nonfunctional PAs exhibited global DNA hypermethylation (mean beta-value 0.47 versus 0.42, P = 0.005); the most significant site of differential DNA methylation was within the promoter region of the potassium voltage-gated channel KCNAB2 (FDR = 5.11×10−10). Pathway analysis of promoter-associated CpGs showed that nonfunctional PAs are potentially associated with the ion-channel activity signal pathway. DNA hypermethylation tended to be negatively correlated with gene expression. DNA methylation analysis may be used to identify candidate genes involved in PA function and may potentially complement current standard immunostaining classification in sporadic PAs. DNA hypermethylation of KCNAB2 and downstream ion-channel activity signal pathways may contribute to the endocrine-inactive status of nonfunctional PAs."

To gain new information about tomosyn's activity, we characterized its mobility and organization on the plasma membrane (PM) in relation to other SNARE proteins and inhibition of exocytosis. By using direct stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (dSTORM), we found tomosyn to be organized in small clusters adjacent to syntaxin clusters. In addition, we show that tomosyn is present in both syntaxin-tomosyn complexes and syntaxin-SNAP25-tomosyn complexes. Tomosyn mutants that lack residues 537–578 or 897–917 from its β-propeller core diffused faster on the PM and exhibited reduced binding to SNAP25, suggesting that these mutants shift the equilibrium between tomosyn-syntaxin-SNAP25 complexes on the PM to tomosyn-syntaxin complexes. As these deletion mutants impose less inhibition on exocytosis, we suggest that tomosyn inhibition is mediated via tomosyn-syntaxin-SNAP25 complexes and not tomosyn-syntaxin complexes.

One of the processes occurring during priming is the assembly of the three soluble NSF attachment protein receptor (SNARE) proteins into a stable and highly conserved complex, termed SNARE complex (1Chen Y.A. Scales S.J. Scheller R.H. Sequential SNARE assembly underlies priming and triggering of exocytosis.Neuron. 2001; 30: 161-170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The SNARE complex is composed of the vesicular SNARE synaptobrevin and the PM SNARE proteins syntaxin and SNAP25 (2Söllner T. Whiteheart S.W. Brunner M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Geromanos S. Tempst P. Rothman J.E. SNAP receptors implicated in vesicle targeting and fusion.Nature. 1993; 362: 318-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (2621) Google Scholar). Once assembled, the SNARE complex catalyzes vesicle fusion during exocytosis in neurons and neuroendocrine cells by overcoming the energy barrier required for this process (3Chen Y.A. Scheller R.H. SNARE-mediated membrane fusion.Nat. Rev. 2001; 2: 98-106Crossref Scopus (869) Google Scholar). Several SNARE-interacting proteins are thought to regulate priming, one of them being tomosyn, which is known as a negative regulator of exocytosis and, in particular, priming (4Fujita Y.

Tomosyn was initially discovered as a binding partner of syntaxin, creating a complex with syntaxin, SNAP25, and synaptotagmin (4Fujita Y. Shirataki H. Sakisaka T. Asakura T. Ohya T. Kotani H.

A few years later, Hatsuzawa et al. (6Hatsuzawa K. Lang T. Fasshauer D. Bruns D. Jahn R. The R-SNARE motif of tomosyn forms SNARE core complexes with syntaxin 1 and SNAP-25 and down-regulates exocytosis.J. Biol.

Tomosyn contains a synaptobrevin-like SNARE motif but lacks a transmembrane anchor, which might preclude the SNARE molecules from forming fusogenic SNARE complexes, thereby inhibiting priming and fusion. It was also claimed that the N-terminal WD40 repeat domain of tomosyn catalyzes oligomerization of the SNARE complex, leading to inhibition of neurotransmitter release (7Sakisaka T. Yamamoto Y. Mochida S. Nakamura M. Nishikawa K. Ishizaki H. Okamoto-Tanaka M. Miyoshi J. Fujiyoshi Y. Manabe T. Takai Y. Dual inhibition of SNARE complex formation by tomosyn ensures controlled neurotransmitter release.J. Cell Biol. 2008; 183: 323-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it was shown that tomosyn can inhibit exocytosis independently of its SNARE interaction with syntaxin and that the integrity of the WD40 domain is crucial for tomosyn's inhibitory function (8Yizhar O. Lipstein N. Gladycheva S.E. Matti U. Ernst S.A. Rettig J. Stuenkel E.L. Ashery U. Multiple functional domains are involved in tomosyn regulation of exocytosis.J. Neurochem. 2007; 103: 604-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Hence, there is conflicting evidence for tomosyn's mode of action. In 2007, the crystal structure of one of tomosyn's homologs in yeast (Sro7p) was published, revealing a backbone composed of two 7-bladed WD40 β-propellers leading to a “tail” domain bound to the β-propeller loops (9Hattendorf D.A.

We used this structure as a template for homology modeling to build a putative structural model for tomosyn (10Williams A.L. Bielopolski N. Meroz D. Lam A.D. Passmore D.R. Ben-Tal N. Ernst S.A. Ashery U. Stuenkel E.L. Structural and functional analysis of tomosyn identifies domains important in exocytotic regulation.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 14542-14553Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In this model, tomosyn also possesses two WD40 β-propellers followed by a tail domain. However, tomosyn's sequence is longer than that of Sro7p, creating regions in the model with no template. Three major insertions of this type were termed loop 1 (537–578 aa), loop 2 (675–752 aa), and loop 3 (897–917 aa) of rat tomosyn isoform m-1. PC12 cells expressing tomosyn lacking loop 1 or loop 3 (Δ-loop 1 and Δ-loop 3, respectively) lost their ability to inhibit secretion of human growth hormone compared with cells expressing the wild type tomosyn (10Williams A.L.

Interestingly, the interaction of the tomosyn Δ-loop mutants with syntaxin was not altered as measured by GST-pulldown experiments, and they exhibited similar translocalization to the PM upon coexpression with syntaxin to that of the wild type tomosyn (10Williams A.L.

Therefore, the reason for the loss of function of Δ-loop 1 and Δ-loop 3 mutants remained unknown. Until recently, the organization and dynamics of presynaptic proteins involved in vesicle priming and fusion had not been extensively studied. Studies using super-resolution imaging showed that syntaxin and SNAP25 form separate clusters with very little overlap, although they require each other for fusion (11Bar-On D.

Rat syntaxin-1A and m-tomosyn-1 were fused to the C terminus of the fluorescent proteins EGFP and monomeric red fluorescent protein. Preparation of the deletion mutants was as described previously (10Williams A.L. Bielopolski N. Meroz D. Lam A.D. Passmore D.R. Ben-Tal N. Ernst S.A. Ashery U. Stuenkel E.L.

C-terminal deletion of tomosyn aa 1–1067 (tomosyn-ΔCT, D1068X) was constructed using the PCR-based QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Monomeric mutants (A206K) of pECFP-C1 and pEcYFP-C1 (citrine) vectors harboring the LoxP sequence at the C-terminal end of the fluorophore were used as recipients for subcloning using the Cre recombinase-mediated Creator system (Clontech). Nucleotide sequences encoding rat syntaxin-1A, m-tomosyn-1, and SNAP25 were fused to the C terminus of each fluoroprotein sequence. A flexible 14–17-aa linker was inserted between the fluoroprotein and the gene of interest to reduce restrictions on fluoroprotein orientation. Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit to generate a mutant of SNAP25. PC12 cells were cultured at 37 °C in 5% CO2 in culture dishes that contained glass coverslips pretreated with poly-d-lysine (100 μg/ml). The culture medium was Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% horse serum, 5% fetal bovine serum, and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen). Cells were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol, except that one-half of the suggested Lipofectamine concentration was used. Cells were used for experiments 24–48 h post-transfection. For PLA staining, cells were fixed for 20 min at room temperature in 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), permeabilized for 10 min in 0.2% Triton X-100, and blocked for 30 min in normal goat serum (200 μg/ml). Then cells were probed with affinity-purified primary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature and labeled with secondary antibodies according to the company's protocol (Olink Bioscience, Uppsala, Sweden). To image the distribution of tomosyn in the PM using dSTORM, PC12 cells were grown overnight on poly-l-lysine-coated glass coverslips. Coverslips were sonicated to remove the upper parts of the cells, leaving the native PM sheets attached. These were immediately fixed, washed, and immunostained as described previously (18Bar-On D.

Primary antibody against tomosyn (homemade affinity-purified rabbit anti-tomosyn polyclonal, a kind gift from Dr. Ulf Matti and Prof. Jens Rettig, Saarland University, Germany) was diluted 1:200 for immunocytochemistry and 1:1000 for Western blotting after pulldown.

Primary antibody against syntaxin was diluted 1:100 for PLA (catalog no. 110111, Synaptic Systems, Goettingen, Germany) and for dSTORM staining (mouse monoclonal antibody HPC-1). Primary antibody against SNAP25 was diluted to 1:400 (catalog no. 111011, Synaptic Systems). For dSTORM staining and for single color imaging, Cy5-coupled goat anti-mouse was used. For dual-color imaging, both Cy5-coupled goat anti-mouse and Alexa488-coupled goat anti-rabbit were used as the secondary antibodies (Dianova). Human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293A cells were cultured at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, and 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin. Transfections were performed using Jet-PEI (PolyPlus Transfection, New York) according to the manufacturer's instructions using a 1:2 (DNA/reagent) ratio. FRAP studies were conducted in external solution (140 mm NaCl, 3 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES, and 2 mg/ml glucose) on PC12 cells transfected with EGFP-tomosyn together with nonfluorescently tagged syntaxin. FRAP measurements were performed at 37 °C. An argon-ion laser beam (Innova 70C, Coherent) was focused through a fluorescence microscope (Axio Imager.D1, Carl Zeiss MicroImaging) to a Gaussian spot of 0.77 ± 0.03 μm (Plan Apochromat 63×/1.4 NA oil-immersion objective). Focus was determined at the membrane of the cell where higher fluorescence was measured relative to the cytoplasm. After a brief measurement at the monitoring intensity (488 nm, 1 microwatt), a 5-microwatt pulse (5–10 ms) bleached 60–75% of the fluorescence in the spot, and recovery was followed by the monitoring beam for 30 s. The resulting curve was fitted (see supporting information in Ref. 19Berkovich R. Wolfenson H. Eisenberg S. Ehrlich M. Weiss M. Klafter J. Henis Y.I. Urbakh M.

Image correction and analysis were performed off line using the method of FRET stoichiometry (20Hoppe A. Christensen K. Swanson J.A.

Calibration parameters specific to the optical system and fluorophores that are required for FRET analysis were determined as described previously (21Liu J. Ernst S.A. Gladycheva S.E. Lee Y.Y.

GST and GST-SNAP25 were expressed in a similar manner, and all three proteins were purified by glutathione-Sepharose (Sigma). Purified GST, GST-syntaxin-1A, or GST-SNAP25 (150 pmol) were incubated with glutathione-Sepharose at 4 °C, and excess proteins were removed by three washes with PBS. EGFP-tagged tomosyn mutants were expressed in HEK293 cells by transfection using JetPei (PolyPlus Transfection, New York) according to the manufacturer's instructions using a 1:2 (DNA/reagent) ratio. Lysates prepared from the cells 48 h after transfection were incubated with the coated beads for 2 h at 4 °C in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mg/ml BSA, 0.5 mm DTT, 0.1 m NaCl) with protease inhibitors. The beads were washed four times with PBS, and bound proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with anti-tomosyn antibody (diluted 1:1000). GST-syntaxin-1A, GST-SNAP25, and GST plasmids were a kind gift from Prof. Ilana Lotan (Tel Aviv University). Images were obtained with a Leica TCS SP5 II confocal microscope (Leica Microsystems) under the control of LAS-AF software. Confocal images were acquired using 561 DPSS laser and 436/488/514 argon laser at 400 Hz and 1024 × 1024 pixel with 26 × 26 nm pixel size. Confocal imaging of the PLA experiment was carried out with a Zeiss (Oberkochen, Germany) LSM 510 META confocal microscope. Images were acquired using 633 HeNe laser and 488 argon laser and 512 × 512 pixel with 60 × 60 nm pixel size. PLA signals were collected by acquiring a Z-stack and creating an image of its projection. Signals were quantified by FIJI software (ImageJ) using “FindPeaks” plugin. For single color imaging, shortly before imaging, samples were incubated in a “switching buffer” consisting of PBS, pH 7.4, containing oxygen scavenger (oxygen was removed by adding 0.5 mg ml−1 glucose oxidase (Sigma), 40 μg ml−1 catalase (Roche Applied Science), 10% w/v glucose, and 100 mm β-mercaptoethylamine) (11Bar-On D.

Sauer M. rapidSTORM: accurate, fast open-source software for localization microscopy.Nat. Methods. 2012; 9: 1040-1041Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Briefly, we used an inverted microscope (Olympus IX-71) equipped with an oil-immersion objective (×60, NA 1.45; Olympus). A 641-nm diode laser (Cube 640-100C, Coherent, Santa Clara, CA) was used for excitation of Cy5, and a 488-nm laser (Sapphire 488LP; Coherent) was used for excitation of Alexa488. A polychromatic mirror (HC 410/504/582/669; Semrock, Rochester, NY) was used to separate laser and fluorescence light; the latter was imaged on an electron-multiplying CCD (EMCCD; Ixon DU897, Andor) camera. Additional bandpass filters were used in the detection path of the setup (ET700/75 and HQ535/50, Chroma). Additional lenses were used to achieve a final camera pixel size of 105 nm. 20,000–30,000 frames were recorded with frame rates of 100–140 Hz at irradiation intensities of 1–5 kilowatts/cm2. Applying a laser power of 1–5 kilowatts cm−2, we detected 500–5000 photons/molecule and frame, corresponding to a localization precision of ∼10 nm (24van de Linde S. Löschberger A. Klein T. Heidbreder M. Wolter S. Heilemann M. Sauer M. Direct stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy with standard fluorescent probes.Nat. Protoc. 2011; 6: 991-1009Crossref PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar). In the current imaging setup, a nosepiece stage (e.g. IX2-NPS, Olympus) was used to minimize lateral and especially axial drift. To check for lateral drift, fluorescent beads that do not photobleach during the experiment were immobilized at low density, and their positions were determined as a function of time. By generating histograms of the x and y position of single beads and by determining the standard deviation of the distributions in x and y, lateral drift can be monitored (24van de Linde S. Löschberger A. Klein T. Heidbreder M. Wolter S. Heilemann M. Sauer M. Direct stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy with standard fluorescent probes.Nat. Protoc. 2011; 6: 991-1009Crossref PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar). During the imaging experiments used for the reconstruction of the dSTORM maps, the lateral drift was negligible. For the meta-analysis of the fluorophore blinking events, in case the same molecule was “on” for several (n >1) sequential frames, all blinking events were united to a single blinking event. In case blinking from the same fluorophore occurred several times during the movie (nonsequential), all events were taken into account as part of the dSTORM reconstructed map. For the localization map, we used a photon threshold of 1000 photons applied for the raw data localization text file, i.e. only localizations above 1000 photon counts were used for image reconstruction and further analysis. After these steps, no further threshold or image processing was applied for the reconstructed dSTORM maps. Hence, all the remaining localizations in the map were taken for the Mander's colocalization test and for the clustering analysis. Mander's coefficient calculation was performed on images reconstructed with a pixel size of 10 nm. Colocalization analysis with Mander's coefficient was carried out using JACoP plugin version 2.0 (25Bolte S. Cordelières F.P. A guided tour into subcellular colocalization analysis in light microscopy.J. Microsc. 2006; 224: 213-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (3239) Google Scholar), FIJI software. As a control, a randomized image of the green channel was created, and colocalization was calculated. The control showed 50% decrease in the colocalization with the corresponding syntaxin image compared with the original picture. To visualize tomosyn-SNARE interactions in living cells, N-terminal fluoroprotein-tagged constructs were generated for tomosyn and syntaxin. Confocal microscopy of PC12 cells transfected with wild type tomosyn demonstrated a primarily cytosolic distribution. However, when tomosyn was coexpressed with syntaxin, it demonstrated clear colocalization with syntaxin in the PM region (Fig. 1A), as reported previously (26Gladycheva S.E. Lam A.D. Liu J. D'Andrea-Merrins M. Yizhar O. Lentz S.I. Ashery U. Ernst S.A. Stuenkel E.L. Receptor-mediated regulation of tomosyn-syntaxin 1A interactions in bovine adrenal chromaffin cells.J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 22887-22899Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). To ensure that tomosyn indeed localizes at the PM in the presence of syntaxin and not in submembranal regions, we compared its staining with the membranal staining of the FM dye FM5-95 and observed full overlap between tomosyn and the FM dye (data not shown). The C-terminal SNARE motif of tomosyn is critical for its interaction with other SNARE proteins, and it is through these interactions that tomosyn is believed to localize to the PM (8Yizhar O. Lipstein N. Gladycheva S.E. Matti U. Ernst S.A. Rettig J. Stuenkel E.L. Ashery U. Multiple functional domains are involved in tomosyn regulation of exocytosis.J.

Indeed, a truncation mutant of tomosyn in which the R-SNARE was deleted (tomosyn-ΔCT, aa 1–1067) failed to colocalize to the PM in the presence of syntaxin and showed cytoplasmic distribution, confirming that tomosyn's R-SNARE motif is critical for colocalization with syntaxin to the PM (Fig. 1A). On the PM, tomosyn interacts directly with syntaxin (26Gladycheva S.E. Lam A.D. Liu J. D'Andrea-Merrins M. Yizhar O. Lentz S.I. Ashery U. Ernst S.A. St"

We demonstrate that CryAB interacts with the N and C termini of Ago2, not the catalytic site defined by the convergence of the PAZ, MID, and PIWI domains. We further demonstrate significantly reduced Ago2 activity in the absence of CryAB, highlighting a novel role of CryAB in the mammalian RNAi/microRNA pathway. In skeletal muscle of CryAB null mice, we observe a shift in the hypertrophy-atrophy signaling axis toward atrophy under basal conditions. Moreover, loss of CryAB altered the capability of satellite cells to regenerate skeletal muscle. These studies establish that CryAB is necessary for normal Ago2/RISC activity and cellular homeostasis in skeletal muscle."

Human mitochondrial β-ketoacyl-acyl carrier protein synthase (HsmtKAS) is a key enzyme in the newly discovered mitochondrial fatty acid synthesis pathway that can produce the substrate for lipoic acid (LA) synthesis. HsmtKAS shares conserved catalytic domains with FASN, which are responsible for binding to C75. In our study, we explored the possible effect of C75 on HsmtKAS and mitochondrial function. C75 treatment decreased LA content, impaired mitochondrial function, increased reactive oxygen species content, and reduced cell viability. HsmtKAS but not FASN knockdown had an effect that was similar to C75 treatment. In addition, an LA supplement efficiently inhibited C75-induced mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress. Overexpression of HsmtKAS showed cellular protection against low dose C75 addition, whereas there was no protective effect upon high dose C75 addition. In summary, the mitochondrial fatty acid synthesis pathway has a vital role in mitochondrial function. Besides FASN, C75 might also inhibit HsmtKAS, thereby reducing LA production, impairing mitochondrial function, and potentially having toxic effects. LA supplements sufficiently ameliorated the toxicity of C75, showing that a combination of C75 and LA may be a reliable cancer treatment. 4-Methylene-2-octyl-5-oxotetrahydrofuran-3-carboxylic acid (C75) is a synthetic fatty-acid synthase (FASN) inhibitor with potential therapeutic effects in several cancer models.

https://openalex.org/W2085602706,"Glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored proteins (GPI-APs) are group of proteins that depend on p24 cargo receptors for their transport from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi apparatus. The GPI anchor is expected to act as a sorting and transport signal, but so far little is known about the recognition mechanism. In the present study we investigate the GPI-AP transport in cell knockdown of p24γ, the most diverse p24 subfamily. Knockdown of p24γ2 but not of other p24γ family members impaired the transport of a reporter GPI-AP. Restoration of the knockdown-induced phenotype using chimeric constructs between p24γ2 and the related p24γ1 further implied a role of the α-helical region of p24γ2 but not its GOLD domain in the specific binding of GPI-APs. We conclude that motifs in the membrane-adjacent α-helical region of p24γ2 are involved in recognition of GPI-APs and are consequently responsible for the incorporation of these proteins into coat protein complex II-coated transport vesicles."
https://openalex.org/W2029012493,"Nutritional iron acquisition by bacteria is well described, but almost nothing is known about bacterial iron export even though it is likely to be an important homeostatic mechanism. Here, we show that Bradyrhizobium japonicum MbfA (Blr7895) is an inner membrane protein expressed in cells specifically under high iron conditions. MbfA contains an N-terminal ferritin-like domain (FLD) and a C-terminal domain homologous to the eukaryotic vacuolar membrane Fe2+/Mn2+ transporter CCC1. An mbfA deletion mutant is severely defective in iron export activity, contains >2-fold more intracellular iron than the parent strain, and displays an aberrant iron-dependent gene expression phenotype. B. japonicum is highly resistant to iron and H2O2 stresses, and MbfA contributes substantially to this as determined by phenotypes of the mbfA mutant strain. The N-terminal FLD was localized to the cytoplasmic side of the inner membrane. Substitution mutations in the putative iron-binding amino acid residues E20A and E107A within the N-terminal FLD abrogate iron export activity and stress response function. Purified soluble FLD oxidizes ferrous iron (Fe2+) to incorporate ferric iron (Fe3+) in a 2:1 iron:protein ratio, which does not occur in the E20A/E107A mutant. The FLD fragment is a dimer in solution, implying that the MbfA exporter functions as a dimer. MbfA belongs to a protein family found in numerous prokaryotic genera.

The findings strongly suggest that iron export plays an important role in bacterial iron homeostasis. The ability of bacteria to sense nutrient availability and adapt accordingly contributes to their success in diverse environments. Iron is an essential nutrient required for many cellular processes. Bioavailability of iron is low in aerobic environments because it is mostly oxidized and therefore insoluble. High affinity iron acquisition systems are expressed under iron limitation to scavenge the metal. Iron can also be toxic, as it catalyzes the generation of reactive oxygen species. Thus, metal homeostasis must be maintained. Because of the low bioavailability of iron, studies on the maintenance of iron homeostasis have focused almost exclusively on acquisition of the metal. However, arguments can be made prima facie that control of the cellular iron content by uptake alone would limit the ability of the cell to adapt to changes in the environment. For example, exposure to H2O2 would likely lower the optimal iron content because it can be toxic under that condition, but attenuating uptake alone cannot lower the iron content. The cellular iron concentration can be lowered by dilution through cell division, but factors that mitigate division, such as nutrient limitation, may result in iron toxicity even when iron availability is low. Sequestration by the iron storage proteins ferritin and bacterioferritin can manage iron stress, but they will saturate in the absence of dilution. Little is known about iron export in prokaryotes, and to our knowledge iron efflux activity by bacterial cells has not been demonstrated. An Escherichia coli mutant defective in the yiiP gene has iron-related phenotypes (1Grass G. Otto M. Fricke B. Haney C.J. Rensing C. Nies D.H. Munkelt D.

Bradyrhizobium japonicum lives as a free-living soil organism or as the endosymbiont of soybean, where it fixes atmospheric nitrogen to ammonia to fulfill the nitrogen requirements of the host. Soils are highly variable ecosystems, and symbiosis represents a niche with specific nutritional requirements. Thus, B. japonicum and other rhizobia must be able to accommodate changes in metal availability.

For creating the mbfA mutant, the open reading frame plus 600 bp of flanking DNA was isolated by PCR, using genomic DNA as a template and ligated into pBluescript SK2. A deletion removing the open reading frame was constructed by inverse PCR as described previously (10Small S.K. O'Brian M.R. The Bradyrhizobium japonicum frcB gene encodes a diheme ferric reductase.J. Bacteriol. 2011; 193: 4088-4094Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), and the deleted fragment was replaced with a DNA cassette carrying genes for spectinomycin and streptomycin resistance. The construct was introduced into pLO1, mobilized into the parent strain, and selected for double recombinants as described previously (10Small S.K. O'Brian M.R. The Bradyrhizobium japonicum frcB gene encodes a diheme ferric reductase.J. Bacteriol. 2011; 193: 4088-4094Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The mutant was confirmed by PCR and antibiotic resistance and was grown in media supplemented with 50 μg/ml streptomycin and 50 μg/ml spectinomycin. For creating pRK290X mbfA, the open reading frame of mbfA along with 100-bp flanks on either side of the gene (encompassing the promoter of mbfA) was amplified from genomic DNA, and the PCR product was ligated into pSK, to make pSK mbfA. The construct was then ligated into the low copy number plasmid pRK290X to make pRK290X mbfA. For the construction of pRK290X mbfA-HA, the reverse primer was engineered to have HA tag sequence in-frame with the mbfA ORF, immediately upstream of the stop codon. pSK mbfA was used as a template, and the PCR product was cloned to pSK to make pSK mbfA-HA and then subsequently cloned into pRK290X. SOEing PCR (17Vallejo A.N. Pogulis R.J. Pease L.R. In vitro synthesis of novel genes: mutagenesis and recombination by PCR.PCR Methods Appl. 1994; 4: S123-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) was used to tailor the His6 tag sequence, in-frame after the fifth amino acid of mbfA ORF. The final product was amplified using a reverse primer having a HA tag sequence in-frame with the mbfA ORF. The product was ligated to pSK and then subsequently ligated to pRK290X to make pRK290X His-mbfA-HA. pSK mbfA E20A/E107A was made by carrying out QuikChange mutagenesis (Stratagene) on pSK mbfA. The modified DNA was then ligated into pRK290X to make pRK290X mbfA E20A/E107A. To make pSK mbfA E20A/E107A-HA, pSK mbfA E20A/E107A was used as template, and a HA tag was engineered to the reverse primer. The PCR product was cloned into pSK and ligated into pRK2909X to make pRK290X mbfA E20A/E107A HA. Strains with pRK290X were regularly grown in media supplemented with 50 μg/ml tetracycline. Cells were grown to mid log phase, and RNA was isolated by the hot phenol method as described previously (6Yang J. Sangwan I. Lindemann A. Hauser F. Hennecke H. Fischer H.M. O'Brian M.R. Bradyrhizobium japonicum senses iron through the status of haem to regulate iron homeostasis and metabolism.Mol. Microbiol. 2006; 60: 427-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). 1 μg of RNA from each strain were used to make cDNA using Bio-Rad cDNA synthesis kit. Quantitative PCRs were performed as described previously (18Hohle T.H. O'Brian M.R. The mntH gene encodes the major Mn2+ transporter in Bradyrhizobium japonicum and is regulated by manganese via the Fur protein.Mol. Microbiol. 2009; 72: 399-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Data were normalized to gapA and are expressed as average of triplicates, with S.D. represented by the error bars. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 9000 rpm for 5 min, washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline (10 mm Na2HPO4, 2 mm KH2PO4, 137 mm NaCl, and 2.7 mm KCl, pH 7.4), and resuspended in the same buffer. The protein concentrations were measured by BCA protein assay (Pierce). 15 μg of protein from each sample were boiled in SDS loading buffer and loaded on 12% polyacrylamide gel, and immune blotting was carried out. Anti-HA antibody (Sigma) was used at a dilution of 1:2500. Anti-GroEL (Enzo Life Sciences) was used at a dilution of 1:8000. HRP-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (SouthernBiotech, Birmingham, AL) was used as secondary antibody, and the blot was detected using the Immobion chemiluminescence system (Millipore). Cultures were grown to mid log phase, and inner membrane, outer membrane, and cytoplasmic fractions were separated as described previously (19Hohle T.H. Franck W.L. Stacey G. O'Brian M.R. Bacterial outer membrane channel for divalent metal ion acquisition.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2011; 108: 15390-15395Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). 15 μg of protein from each fraction were resolved by 12% PAGE, and immune blotting was carried out. Anti-Myc (Sigma) was used at a titer of 1:2500. Cultures were grown to mid log phase. 30 ml of culture were aliquoted into 250-ml flasks and maintained at 29 °C with shaking. At time zero, radioactive 55Fe was added to a final concentration of 1 μm. 1 ml of cells were removed at different time points and quenched in ice-cold quench buffer (0.1 m Tris, 0.1 m succinate, and 10 mm EDTA, pH 6.0). The quenched cells were immediately collected on 0.45-mm filters presoaked in quench buffer containing 40 mm Fe-EDTA and then counted on a LKB γ-counter. EDTA was added to a final concentration of 3 mm when necessary. 40 ml of wild type or the mbfA mutant cells were grown in GSY with either no added iron or 20 μm FeCl3 added. The cells were harvested at mid log phase by centrifugation at 9000 rpm for 5 min. The pellet was washed twice with ice-cold quench buffer. To remove excess salt, the pellets were washed with double-distilled H2O. To lyse the cells completely, the pellets were treated with 100 μl of 70% nitric acid and incubated at 98 °C for 3 h. 1 ml of double-distilled water were added to this preparation and centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 5 min to remove cell debris. The supernatant was sent for inductively coupled plasma-MS analysis (Penn State Institutes of Energy and the Environment). Cells were grown up to mid log phase in regular GSY. They were then treated with either 5 mm FeSO4, 10 mm FeSO4, 5 mm H2O2, 5 mm CoSO4, 5 mm ZnSO4 or 5 mm MnSO4 for 2 h. Cells were then harvested by centrifugation, washed with PBS twice, and serially diluted in PBS. The serial dilutions were then spotted on regular GSY plates. 50 ml of cells were grown to mid log phase. 10 ml of culture were spun down, washed twice, and resuspended in 3 ml of PBS. This preparation was maintained as whole cells. 20 ml of the remaining culture were spun down and gently resuspended in 20 ml of 0.1 m Tris, 20% sucrose solution. The cells were maintained at 30 °C with gentle shaking. After 1 h, lysozyme was added dropwise to a final concentration of 2 mg/ml for 20 min. Then, prewarmed EDTA was added dropwise over a 2-h period to a final concentration of 3 mm. The formation of spheroplasts was examined and verified by phase-contrast microscopy, where cells were oblong and spheroplasts were circular in shape. This spheroplast culture was then divided into two halves and spun down. In one half of the culture, the integrity of spheroplasts was maintained by very gently resuspending in 3 ml of Tris sucrose buffer, pH 7.8. The other half was resuspended in 3 ml of water and vortexed for a minute. Cell lysis in this suspension was verified by a drop in O.D. of cells and also visually by light microscopy. This preparation is called the broken cells. Proteinase K was added to a final concentration of 0.5 mg/ml to the remaining of all three preparations and incubated in ice for 2 h. All three preparations were then TCA-precipitated and heated at 95 °C for 10 min along with SDS loading buffer. Equal amount of samples were loaded on 12% SDS gels, and Western blotting was carried out with respective antibodies. Anti-Sco1 antibody was used at a titer of of 1:10,000. Anti-His (Invitrogen) antibody was used at a titer of 1:4000. Anti-Mur was used at a titer of 1:5000. For making pET14b FLD, the ORF of mbfA encoding the first 180 amino acids was amplified from genomic DNA and cloned in-frame into pET14b containing an N-terminal His6 tag. The FLD E20A/E107A mutant was made from pET14b FLD by QuikChange mutagenesis. The vector with insert was transformed into chemical-competent BL21(DE3) E. coli cells. Cells were inoculated from an overnight culture grown in Luria-Bertani medium containing 200 μg/ml ampicillin and 25 μg/ml chloramphenicol into 1 liter of fresh 2×YT medium (35Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) containing the same antibiotics and grown at 37 °C. Overexpression was induced in cells at the mid log phase by the addition of 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at 37 °C for 4 h with shaking. The cells were washed in 20 mm HEPES (pH 7) and 100 mm NaCl and resuspended in the same buffer. The cells were broken in a French pressure cell, and the soluble fraction was collected by centrifugation at 9000 rpm for 15 min. The supernatant was then mixed with nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid slurry and rotated at 4 °C for 1 h. The slurry-protein mixture was then poured into a column and washed with wash buffer (20 mm HEPES, 100 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, and 20 mm imidazole), 10 times the column volume. A stepwise elution was performed with 1 column volume of wash buffer with 40, 80, 120, 160, and 200 mm imidazole in the order of increasing imidazole concentrations. Wild type and the FLD E20A/E107A mutant were eluted with 120 mm imidazole. Proteins were then dialyzed using snake skin pleated dialysis tubing 3500MWCO (Thermo Scientific) in dialysis buffer (20 mm HEPES, 100 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol). The His tags were removed with thrombin. Equal amounts of both proteins were run on SDS-polyacrylamide gels to confirm purity of the samples. Apo forms of the proteins were made by dialyzing against 0.3% sodium dithionite and 1 mm 2,2′-dipyridyl for 24 h as described previously (20Bozzi M. Mignogna G. Stefanini S. Barra D. Longhi C.

Freshly prepared ferrous ammonium sulfate was used within minutes of preparation. Iron oxidation was measured at 310 nm in kinetic mode of a Thermo Scientific Genesys 10 bio UV/visible spectrophotometer. Protein added to the buffer was calibrated as blank. Iron oxidation stoichiometry was calculated as described previously (22Le Brun N.E. Wilson M.T. Andrews S.C. Guest J.R. Harrison P.M. Thomson A.J. Moore G.R.

Size exclusion chromatography was performed with a Superose 12(10/300) column using Akta Prime FPLC (GE Healthcare). The column was equilibrated with 20 mm MOPS (pH 7), 100 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol. Standards (Bio-Rad) and subsequently 200 μg of purified FLD and FLD E20A/E107A were eluted with the same buffer at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Elutions were followed spectrophotometrically by tracing UV absorbance at 280 nm. The equation of the standard curve was y = −0.5353x + 2.503 with an R2 value of 0.9933. The blr7895 gene was originally identified as a member of the Irr regulon that contains a very high affinity Irr binding site in its promoter necessary for repression in iron-limited media (23Rudolph G. Hennecke H. Fischer H.M. Beyond the Fur paradigm: iron-controlled gene expression in rhizobia.FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2006; 30: 631-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 24Sangwan I. Small S.K. O'Brian M.R. The Bradyrhizobium japonicum Irr protein is a transcriptional repressor with high-affinity DNA-binding activity.J. Bacteriol. 2008; 190: 5172-5177Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). blr7895 mRNA is expressed under high iron conditions where Irr levels are low. The function of blr7895 is not known, but its homolog in Agrobacterium tumefaciens contributes to resistance to hydrogen peroxide stress by an unknown mechanism (25Ruangkiattikul N. Bhubhanil S. Chamsing J. Niamyim P. Sukchawalit R. Mongkolsuk S. Agrobacterium tumefaciens membrane-bound ferritin plays a role in protection against hydrogen peroxide toxicity and is negatively regulated by the iron response regulator.FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2012; 329: 87-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Blr7895 is predicted to contain an N-terminal domain homologous to the uncharacterized ferritin-like AB protein family. The x-ray crystal structure of a family member from Magnetospirillum magnetotacticum has been solved as a dimer (Protein Data Bank ID code 2OH3). The C-terminal portion of Blr7895 shares 46% similarity with CCC1, a vacuolar membrane protein that transports Fe2+ and Mn2+ from the cytoplasm into the vacuole in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and other eukaryotes (26Lapinskas P.J. Lin S.J. Culotta V.C. The role of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae CCC1 gene in the homeostasis of manganese ions.Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 21: 519-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 27Li L.

Chem. 2001; 276: 29515-29519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Blr7895 is not related to E. coli FetA, FetB, or YiiP, but homologs of it are found in many eubacterial and archaeal genera. Although CCC1 is a eukaryotic transporter, no eukaryotic proteins containing both domains of Blr7895 were found in homology searches. In assigning names to Irr regulon genes based solely on homology, Rodionov et al. named blr7895 and its homologs mbfA for membrane-bound ferritin (28Rodionov D.A. Gelfand M.S. Todd J.D. Curson A.R. Johnston A.W. Computational reconstruction of iron- and manganese-responsive transcriptional networks in α-proteobacteria.PLoS Comput. Biol. 2006; 2: e163Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), and this designation was used subsequently for the A. tumefaciens homolog (25Ruangkiattikul N. Bhubhanil S. Chamsing J. Niamyim P. Sukchawalit R. Mongkolsuk S. Agrobacterium tumefaciens membrane-bound ferritin plays a role in protection against hydrogen peroxide toxicity and is negatively regulated by the iron response regulator.FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2012; 329: 87-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). As described below, blr7895 is not a bona fide ferritin, but we adopted the gene designation mbfA herein nevertheless based on the established precedent. We found previously that mbfA mRNA is expressed maximally when grown in high iron media (24Sangwan I. Small S.K. O'Brian M.R. The Bradyrhizobium japonicum Irr protein is a transcriptional repressor with high-affinity DNA-binding activity.J. Bacteriol. 2008; 190: 5172-5177Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Here, we grew cells supplemented with a 100 μm concentration of Fe, Co, Zn, or Mn, and examined mbfA transcripts by qualitative real-time PCR (Fig. 1A). Only iron was able to derepress the mbfA gene. To examine protein levels, we expressed a mbfA-HA gene in trans in B. japonicum from its own promoter in cells grown in media supplemented with 20 μm or 100 μm Fe, Mn, Co, and Zn (Fig. 1B). MbfA protein was detectable on Western blots in cells grown in high iron media, but not in media supplemented with the other metals, and thus mRNA and protein levels correlated with each other and demonstrate that mbfA expression is specifically iron-dependent. B. japonicum cells harboring mbfA-HA grown in high iron media were fractionated into cytoplasmic, inner, and outer membrane fractions. The integrity of each fraction was confirmed by Western blot analysis using MntH, MnoP, and Mur as markers for the inner membrane, outer membrane, and cytosol, respectively (Fig. 2). MbfA-HA localized exclusively to the inner membrane. As described below, the mbfA-HA gene complemented an mbfA mutant, thus its use here is physiologically meaningful. Bacterial iron transporters that have been characterized previously are expressed under iron limitation and are required for high affinity uptake. Thus, the expression of mbfA under high iron conditions made it a good candidate for an iron exporter. Moreover, transport from the cytoplasm to the vacuole in eukaryotes is analogous to transport from inside the cytoplasm to outside. To test this idea, we added 1 μm 55FeCl3 to cultures of B. japonicum cells at mid log phase, harvested them at various time points, and measured radiolabel in them (Fig. 3A). In the parent strain, 55Fe was taken up by cells for approximately 20 min after addition, followed by efflux. The mbfA mutant showed similar initial 55Fe uptake, but little subsequent efflux was observed. Because the observed transport of 55Fe in cells at a given time is the net result of its import and export, we wanted to examine export alone. To do this, we added EDTA to chelate extracellular iron in the media 20 min after addition to prevent further uptake (Fig. 3A). We found that the rate of export with EDTA by the parent strain was only modestly greater than without it, suggesting little uptake after 20 min even without EDTA addition. In the mbfA mutant, little efflux was observed after the addition of EDTA, similar to what was observed without the chelator. The data show that MbfA is required for iron export from cells. To confirm that deletion of the mbfA gene was responsible for the Fe export phenotype, we complemented the mutant with the mbfA gene in trans (Fig. 3C). In addition, we found that the mbfA-HA gene also complemented"

Methods for genetic engineering of iPSC that emphasize precision and minimize random integration would be beneficial. We demonstrate here an approach in the mdx mouse model of Duchenne muscular dystrophy that focuses on the use of site-specific recombinases to achieve genetic engineering. We employed non-viral, plasmid-mediated methods to reprogram mdx fibroblasts, using phiC31 integrase to insert a single copy of the reprogramming genes at a safe location in the genome. We next used Bxb1 integrase to add the therapeutic full-length dystrophin cDNA to the iPSC in a site-specific manner. Unwanted DNA sequences, including the reprogramming genes, were then precisely deleted with Cre resolvase. Pluripotency of the iPSC was analyzed before and after gene addition, and ability of the genetically corrected iPSC to differentiate into myogenic precursors was evaluated by morphology, immunohistochemistry, qRT-PCR, FACS analysis, and intramuscular engraftment. These data demonstrate a non-viral, reprogramming-plus-gene addition genetic engineering strategy utilizing site-specific recombinases that can be applied easily to mouse cells. This work introduces a significant level of precision in the genetic engineering of iPSC that can be built upon in future studies."
https://openalex.org/W2082540214,"Cell cycle progression requires a series of highly coordinated events that ultimately lead to faithful segregation of chromosomes. Aurora B is an essential mitotic kinase, which is involved in regulation of microtubule-kinetochore attachments and cytokinesis. Inhibition of Aurora B results in stabilization of p53 and induction of p53-target genes such as p21 to inhibit proliferation. We have previously demonstrated that induction of p21 by p53 after inhibition of Aurora B is dependent on the p38 MAPK, which promotes transcriptional elongation of p21 by RNA Pol II. In this study, we show that a subset of p53-target genes are induced in a p38-dependent manner upon inhibition of Aurora B. We also demonstrate that inhibition of Aurora B results in down-regulation of E2F-mediated transcription and that the cell cycle arrest after Aurora B inhibition depends on p53 and pRB tumor suppressor pathways. In addition, we report that activation of p21 after inhibition of Aurora B is correlated with increased chromosome missegregation and aneuploidy but not with binucleation or tetraploidy. We provide evidence that p21 is activated in aneuploid cells by reactive oxygen species (ROS) and p38 MAPK. Finally, we demonstrate that certain drugs that act on aneuploid cells synergize with inhibitors of Aurora B to inhibit colony formation and oncogenic transformation. These findings provide an important link between aneuploidy and the stress pathways activated by Aurora B inhibition and also support the use of Aurora B inhibitors in combination therapy for treatment of cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2091528617,"Elevated baseline circulating alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level has been demonstrated to be associated with an increased risk of the metabolic syndrome (MetS), but the nature of the dose-response relationship is uncertain.We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of published prospective cohort studies to characterize in detail the nature of the dose-response relationship between baseline ALT level and risk of incident MetS in the general population. Relevant studies were identified in a literature search of MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Web of Science up to December 2013. Prospective studies in which investigators reported relative risks (RRs) of MetS for 3 or more categories of ALT levels were eligible. A potential nonlinear relationship between ALT levels and MetS was examined using restricted cubic splines.Of the 489 studies reviewed, relevant data were available on 29,815 non-overlapping participants comprising 2,125 incident MetS events from five prospective cohort studies. There was evidence of a linear association (P for nonlinearity=0.38) between ALT level and risk of MetS, characterised by a graded increase in MetS risk at ALT levels 6-40 U/L. The risk of MetS increased by 14% for every 5 U/L increment in circulating ALT level (95% CI: 12-17%). Evidence was lacking of heterogeneity and publication bias among the contributing studies.Baseline ALT level is associated with risk of the MetS in a linear dose-response manner. Studies are needed to determine whether the association represents a causal relationship."

Development and use of a VW resistant variety is the most practical and effective way to manage this disease. Identification of highly resistant genes/QTL and the underlining genetic architecture is a prerequisite for developing a VW resistant variety. A major QTL qVW-c6-1 conferring resistance to the defoliating isolate V991 was identified on chromosome 6 in LHB22×JM11 F2∶3 population inoculated and grown in a greenhouse. This QTL was further validated in the LHB22×NNG F2∶3 population that was evaluated in an artificial disease nursery of V991 for two years and in its subsequent F4 population grown in a field severely infested by V991. The allele conferring resistance within the QTL qVW-c6-1 region originated from parent LHB22 and could explain 23.1–27.1% of phenotypic variation. Another resistance QTL qVW-c21-1 originated from the susceptible parent JM11 was mapped on chromosome 21, explaining 14.44% of phenotypic variation. The resistance QTL reported herein provides a useful tool for breeding a cotton variety with enhanced resistance to VW."
https://openalex.org/W1982294397,"As the murine model of laser-induced choroidal neovascularization (CNV) is becoming the most established and commonly utilized model worldwide for studying the pathogenesis of CNV and its response to treatment, specific operating standards are yet to be clarified. The purpose of this study is to compare the lesion size of CNV in mice with different ages, sex, durations of CNV process, and treated positions of laser spots, to make recommendations that may improve and optimize the quality of the model.C57/BL6 mice of different ages were treated with diode laser photocoagulation per eye and perfused with PBS containing fluorescein-labeled dextran at different time of observation. Choroid flat mounts, were then examined by fluorescence microscopy for the measurement of CNV area. Messenger-RNA expression levels of several angiogenic cytokines in eye cups of male and female C57BL/6 mice at 5-8 and 16-20 week-old were analyzed by real-time RT-PCR assay. The results showed significantly more CNV area in eyes of female mice compared to male mice with the expression level of several angiogenic cytokines elevated. 16-20-week-old female mice developed the biggest area of CNV. The mean area of CNV increased significantly at the 14th day after photocoagulation. Laser spots delivered 1PD away from the optic disc induced the biggest area of CNV compared to those 2PD or 3PD away. Interaction of NV was observed in laser spots delivered less than 1PD away from each other.The current results suggest that 16-20-week-old female C57BL/6 mice developed the most distinct CNV lesion size with laser spots delivered 1PD away from the optic disc. The best time to observe and analyze is the 14th day after photocoagulation."
https://openalex.org/W2024522001,"Rotavirus is an important pediatric pathogen, causing severe diarrhea and being associated with a high mortality rate causing approximately 500 000 deaths annually worldwide. Even though some vaccines are currently available, their efficacy is lower in the developing world, as compared to developed countries. Therefore, alternative or complementary treatment options are needed in the developing countries where the disease burden is the largest. The effect of Lactobacillus in promoting health and its use as a vehicle for delivery of protein and antibody fragments was previously shown. In this study, we have developed co-expression vectors enabling Lactobacillus paracasei BL23 to produce two VHH fragments against rotavirus (referred to as anti-rotavirus proteins 1 and 3, ARP1 and ARP3) as secreted and/or surface displayed products. ARP1 and ARP3 fragments were successfully co-expressed as shown by Western blot and flow cytometry. In addition, engineered Lactobacillus produced VHH antibody fragments were shown to bind to a broad range of rotavirus serotypes (including the human rotavirus strains 69M, Va70, F45, DS1, Wa and ST3 and simian rotavirus strains including RRV and SA11), by flow cytometry and ELISA. Hereby, we have demonstrated for the first time that when RRV was captured by one VHH displayed on the surface of co-expressor Lactobacillus, targeting other epitope was possible with another VHH secreted from the same bacterium. Therefore, Lactobacillus producing two VHH antibody fragments may potentially serve as treatment against rotavirus with a reduced risk of development of escape mutants. This co-expression and delivery platform can also be used for delivery of VHH fragments against a variety of mucosal pathogens or production of other therapeutic molecules."
https://openalex.org/W1969999498,"Pancreatic cancer remains one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths, due to aggressive growth, high metastatic rates during the early stage and the lack of an effective therapeutic approach. We previously showed that Qingyihuaji (QYHJ), a seven-herb Chinese medicine formula, exhibited significant anti-cancer effects in pancreatic cancer, associated with modifications in the tumor microenvironment, particularly the inhibition of cancer-associated fibroblast (CAF) activation. In the present study, we generated CAF and paired normal fibroblast (NF) cultures from resected human pancreatic cancer tissues. We observed that CAFs exhibited an enhanced capacity for inducing pancreatic cancer cell migration and invasion compared with NFs, while QYHJ-treated CAFs exhibited decreased migration and invasion-promoting capacities in vitro. The results of further analyses indicated that compared with NFs, CAFs exhibit increased CXCL1, 2 and 8 expression, contributing to the enhanced invasion-promoting capacities of these cells, while QYHJ treatment significantly suppressed CAF proliferation activities and the production of CAF-derived CXCL1, 2 and 8. These in vitro observations were confirmed in mice models of human pancreatic cancer. Taken together, these results suggested that suppressing the tumor-promoting capacity of CAFs through Chinese herbal medicine attenuates pancreatic cancer cell invasion."

Sil is composed of 101 amino acid residues and shares 35.6% overall sequence identity with the lactococcin 972 of Lactococcus lactis. Immunoblot analysis showed that Sil was secreted by S. iniae into the extracellular milieu. Purified recombinant Sil (rSil) exhibited a dose-dependent inhibitory effect on the growth of Bacillus subtilis but had no impact on the growths of other 16 Gram-positive bacteria and 10 Gram-negative bacteria representing 23 different bacterial species. Treatment of rSil by heating at 50°C abolished the activity of rSil. rSil bound to the surface of B. subtilis but induced no killing of the target cells. Cellular study revealed that rSil interacted with turbot (Scophthalmus maximus) head kidney monocytes and inhibited the innate immune response of the cells, which led to enhanced cellular infection of S. iniae. Antibody blocking of the extracellular Sil produced by S. iniae significantly attenuated the infectivity of S. iniae. Consistent with these in vitro observations, in vivo study showed that administration of turbot with rSil prior to S. iniae infection significantly increased bacterial dissemination and colonization in fish tissues. Taken together, these results indicate that Sil is a novel virulence-associated bacteriostatic and an immunoregulator that promotes S. iniae infection by impairing the immune defense of host fish."

PCC 7002 and many other cyanobacteria have two genes that encode key enzymes involved in chlorophyll a, biliverdin, and heme biosynthesis: acsFI/acsFII, ho1/ho2, and hemF/hemN. Under atmospheric O2 levels, AcsFI synthesizes 3,8-divinyl protochlorophyllide from Mg-protoporphyrin IX monomethyl ester, Ho1 oxidatively cleaves heme to form biliverdin, and HemF oxidizes coproporphyrinogen III to protoporphyrinogen IX. Under microoxic conditions, another set of genes directs the synthesis of alternative enzymes AcsFII, Ho2, and HemN. In Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002, open reading frame SynPCC7002_A1993 encodes a MarR family transcriptional regulator, which is located immediately upstream from the operon comprising acsFII, ho2, hemN, and desF (the latter encodes a putative fatty acid desaturase). Deletion and complementation analyses showed that this gene, denoted chlR, is a transcriptional activator that is essential for transcription of the acsFII-ho2-hemN-desF operon under microoxic conditions. Global transcriptome analyses showed that ChlR controls the expression of only these four genes. Co-expression of chlR with a yfp reporter gene under the control of the acsFII promoter from Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 in Escherichia coli demonstrated that no other cyanobacterium-specific components are required for proper functioning of this regulatory circuit. A combination of analytical methods and Mössbauer and EPR spectroscopies showed that reconstituted, recombinant ChlR forms homodimers that harbor one oxygen-sensitive [4Fe-4S] cluster. We conclude that ChlR is a transcriptional activator that uses a [4Fe-4S] cluster to sense O2 levels and thereby control the expression of the acsFII-ho2-hemN-desF operon. Synechococcus sp.

Microorganisms acclimate continuously to changes in their physicochemical environments, including changes in nutrient availability, energy sources, salinity, pH, and temperature. Light is the energy source for phototrophic organisms; and thus, light wavelength and total irradiance are usually among the most important environmental factors for phototrophic organisms. Cyanobacteria perform oxygenic photosynthesis; and therefore, the supply of reducing equivalents generated by the photosynthetic apparatus increases with increasing irradiance, but the oxygen levels inside cells as well as in the immediate micro-environment can fluctuate significantly because of photosystem II activity and changes in respiratory oxygen uptake (1Bryant D.A. The Molecular Biology of Cyanobacteria. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1994Crossref Google Scholar). Thus, cyanobacteria can rapidly acclimate to diurnal shifts in light availability, to rapidly changing irradiance levels throughout the day, and to the accompanying changes in oxygen levels that result. Adjustments can be made by several mechanisms, including changes in gene expression; protein maturation, assembly and stability; post-translational modifications of enzymes; and even substrate availability for O2-dependent enzymes. For the model cyanobacterium Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002 (hereafter Synechococcus 7002), the impact of physicochemical parameters has been extensively studied using global systems biological approaches, including transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics (2Ludwig M.

Transcription profiling of the model cyanobacterium Synechococcus sp. strain PCC 7002 by NextGen (SOLiDTM) sequencing of cDNA.Front. Microbiol. 2011; 2: 41Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), whereas other conditions, such as limitation for nutrients, cause more specific and limited short term responses (3Ludwig M. Bryant D.A. Synechococcus sp. strain PCC 7002 transcriptome: acclimation to temperature, salinity, oxidative stress, and mixotrophic growth conditions.Front.

Large changes in transcript levels for the acsFII-ho2-hemN-desF operon, which encodes key enzymes required for chlorophyll a, phycocyanobilin, heme, and lipid biosynthesis, were observed in response to changes in oxygen (2Ludwig M. Bryant D.A. Transcription profiling of the model cyanobacterium Synechococcus sp. strain PCC 7002 by NextGen (SOLiDTM) sequencing of cDNA.Front. Microbiol. 2011; 2: 41Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). A similar gene cluster comprising the open reading frames (ORFs) sll1874 (acsFII/chlAII), sll1875 (ho2), and sll1876 (hemN) occurs in Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 (hereafter Synechocystis 6803), and transcript levels for these three genes also coordinately increase under microoxic conditions (7Minamizaki K. Mizoguchi T. Goto T. Tamiaki H. Fujita Y. Identification of two homologous genes, chlAIchlAII, that are differentially involved in isocyclic ring formation of chlorophyll a in the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803.J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 2684-2692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The acsFII, ho2, and hemN genes encode important enzymes that are involved in pigment biosynthesis: Mg-protoporphyrin monomethyl ester oxidative ring cyclase, heme oxygenase, and coproporphyrinogen III oxidase, respectively. Many cyanobacterial genomes encode two genes that produce alternative enzymes for these functions. For example, in Synechocystis 6803, there are two Mg-protoporphyrin monomethyl ester oxidative ring cyclases, AcsFI/ChlAI (sll1214) and AcsFII/ChlAII (sll1874), respectively. AcsFI/ChlAI catalyzes the formation of the isocyclic ring of chlorophyll a (converting Mg-protoporphyrin IX monomethyl ester into 3,8-divinyl protochlorophyllide) under atmospheric oxygen levels, whereas under microoxic growth conditions, the same reaction is mainly performed by AcsFII/ChlAII (7Minamizaki K. Mizoguchi T. Goto T. Tamiaki H. Fujita Y. Identification of two homologous genes, chlAIchlAII, that are differentially involved in isocyclic ring formation of chlorophyll a in the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803.J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 2684-2692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Interestingly, both enzymes are monooxygenases and require molecular O2 as a substrate. These enzymes are unrelated to Mg-protoporphyrin monomethyl ester oxidative ring cyclases of the BchE type, which are O2-independent enzymes of the radical S-adenosylmethionine superfamily that use water as the oxygen donor for formation of the 131-oxo group of (bacterio) chlorophylls and are widely distributed in anoxygenic phototrophs (8Porra R.J.

Cyanobacteria as well as rhodophyte, glaucophyte, and cryptomonad algae use phycobiliproteins as major antenna pigments for photosynthesis (12Neilson J.A. Durnford D.G. Structural and functional diversification of the light-harvesting complexes in photosynthetic eukaryotes.Photosynth. Res. 2010; 106: 57-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 13Sidler W.A. Bryant D.A. The Molecular Biology of Cyanobacteria. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1994: 139-216Crossref Google Scholar). Because phycobiliproteins have numerous linear tetrapyrrole (phycobilin) chromophores, these organisms are critically dependent on heme oxygenase activity for the production of the bilin chromophores of the light-harvesting phycobiliproteins. Synechocystis 6803 has two heme oxygenases, Ho1 (sll1184) and Ho2 (sll1875), which can oxidatively cleave the heme macrocycle in a reaction that requires both O2 and reducing equivalents and which produces carbon monoxide and biliverdin, the precursor of all linear tetrapyrrole pigments (14Beale S.I. Biosynthesis of phycobilins.Chem. Rev. 1993; 93: 785-802Crossref Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Like Ho1 of Synechocystis 6803 and the heme oxygenases of other organisms, Ho2 also requires molecular oxygen for its catalytic activity (15Zhang X. Migita C.T. Sato M. Sasahara M. Yoshida T. Protein expressed by the ho2 gene of the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 is a true heme oxygenase. Properties of the heme and enzyme complex.FEBS J. 2005; 272: 1012-1022Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Under microoxic conditions and especially at high irradiance levels, Ho2 is the major enzyme cleaving heme to form biliverdin. Ho1 catalyzes the same reaction under atmospheric O2 levels (16Aoki R. Goto T. Fujita Y. A heme oxygenase isoform is essential for aerobic growth in the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp.

The third gene of the cluster expressed under microoxic conditions, hemN (sll1876), encodes an oxygen-independent coproporphyrinogen III oxidase (HemN type), which belongs to the radical S-adenosylmethionine protein superfamily (18Layer G. Heinz D.W. Jahn D. Schubert W.-D. Structure and function of radical SAM enzymes.Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2004; 8: 468-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). It harbors an oxygen-sensitive [4Fe-4S] cluster and requires S-adenosylmethionine for catalysis (19Troup B. Hungerer C. Jahn D.

Crystal structure of coproporphyrinogen III oxidase reveals cofactor geometry of radical SAM enzymes.EMBO J. 2003; 22: 6214-6224Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Besides hemN, the Synechocystis 6803 genome includes a gene for an oxygen-dependent coproporphyrinogen III oxidase (HemF, sll1185), which is a monooxygenase with a binuclear iron center (21Troup B. Jahn M. Hungerer C. Jahn D. Isolation of the hemF operon containing the gene for the Escherichia coli aerobic coproporphyrinogen III oxidase by in vivo complementation of a yeast HEM13 mutant.J.

Chem. 2004; 279: 38960-38968Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). In Synechocystis 6803, hemN has been shown to be induced under microoxic conditions, but hemF is required for growth at atmospheric O2 levels (23Goto T. Aoki R. Minamizaki K. Fujita Y. Functional differentiation of two analogous coproporphyrinogen III oxidases for heme and chlorophyll biosynthesis pathways in the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803.Plant Cell Physiol. 2010; 51: 650-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The role of a second hemN-like gene (sll1917) in Synechocystis 6803 remains unclear (23Goto T. Aoki R. Minamizaki K. Fujita Y. Functional differentiation of two analogous coproporphyrinogen III oxidases for heme and chlorophyll biosynthesis pathways in the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803.Plant Cell Physiol. 2010; 51: 650-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). A microarray study in Synechocystis 6803 showed that the psbA1 gene, encoding an alternative D1 subunit of photosystem II, and the acsFII-ho2-hemN operon were the only four genes for which transcript levels increased substantially under microoxic conditions (24Summerfield T.C. Toepel J. Sherman L.A. Low-oxygen induction of normally cryptic psbA genes in cyanobacteria.Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 12939-12941Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Recently, a MarR-type transcriptional activator (sll1512) that apparently controls the expression of these four genes was described (25Aoki R. Takeda T. Omata T. Ihara K. Fujita Y. MarR-type transcriptional regulator ChlR activates expression of tetrapyrrole biosynthesis genes in response to low-oxygen conditions in cyanobacteria.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 13500-13507Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). While Aoki et al. (25Aoki R. Takeda T. Omata T. Ihara K. Fujita Y. MarR-type transcriptional regulator ChlR activates expression of tetrapyrrole biosynthesis genes in response to low-oxygen conditions in cyanobacteria.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 13500-13507Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) were studying the product of sll1512, we identified a similar transcriptional regulator, the product of ORF SYNPCC7002_A1993 in Synechococcus 7002. In the studies presented here, we show that the product of this ORF, ChlR, is a transcription activator that controls the expression of a single operon encoding four genes in Synechococcus 7002. Additionally, we show that this transcription factor activates transcription from the acsFII promoter of Synechocystis 6803 in the absence of any other cyanobacterium-specific factors in Escherichia coli. Finally, we show that this transcription activator harbors a single oxygen-sensitive [4Fe-4S] cluster per homodimer that acts as the O2 sensory prosthetic group. Synechococcus sp. strain PCC 7002 wild-type and mutant strains were maintained in liquid culture and on 1.5% agar plates in medium A supplemented with 1 mg of NaNO3 ml−1 (designated as medium A+) as described previously (2Ludwig M. Bryant D.A. Transcription profiling of the model cyanobacterium Synechococcus sp. strain PCC 7002 by NextGen (SOLiDTM) sequencing of cDNA.Front.

U.S.A. 1980; 77: 6052-6056Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Cultures of the SynPCC7002_A1993 (ChlR) overexpression strain (under control of an ammonia-repressible promoter) that were used for RNA extractions were grown in a HEPES-buffered A medium (25 mm HEPES, pH 8.0 replaced 8.3 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.2) containing either 12 mm NaNO3 or 10 mm NH4Cl (4Ludwig M. Bryant D.A. Acclimation of the global transcriptome of the cyanobacterium Synechococcus sp. strain PCC 7002 to nutrient limitations and different nitrogen sources.Front. Microbiol. 2012; 3: 145Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Liquid cultures were grown in tubes containing medium (25 ml) at 38 °C with continuous irradiation with 250 μmol of photons m−2 s−1. The cultures were sparged with either 1% (v/v) CO2 in air (standard conditions) or 1% (v/v) CO2 in N2 (microoxic conditions). The following antibiotic concentrations were added to the medium when appropriate: 50 μg ml−1 for spectinomycin and/or 20 μg ml−1 for gentamycin. Cultures for growth rate determination were cultivated without antibiotics, whereas cultures for RNA analyses were grown in the presence of the respective antibiotics. Cell growth was monitored by measuring the optical density at 730 nm (OD730 nm; 1.0 OD730 nm = 1.0 ± 0.2 × 108 cells ml−1) with a Genesys 10 spectrophotometer (ThermoSpectronic, Rochester, NY). Cultures for RNA analyses were inoculated at an OD730 nm between 0.05 and 0.1 from precultures that had been grown under the same conditions. When these cultures reached an OD730 nm of 0.7, three independently grown, replicate cultures were pooled. Cells derived from 25-ml aliquots of the cultures were rapidly centrifuged (5 min, 5000 × g, 4 °C), and the cell pellets were rapidly frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C until required. To inactivate the chlR (SynPCC7002_A1993) gene of Synechococcus 7002, ∼1000-bp regions immediately upstream and downstream of chlR were amplified by PCR with primers 1 and 2 for the upstream sequence and primers 3 and 4 for the downstream sequence (see Table 1 for oligonucleotide sequences). Oligonucleotides 2 and 3 introduced EcoRV sites 2 bases downstream from the start codon and 6 bases upstream of the stop codon. The PCR products for the upstream and downstream flanking regions were digested with EcoRV, and the aadA gene conferring streptomycin and spectinomycin resistance was excised as a 1091-bp Eco53kI fragment from plasmid pSRA2 (plasmids used and constructed in this study are listed in Table 2). The flanking regions and the aadA cassette were purified after electrophoresis of DNA fragments on agarose gels. The fragments were mixed at a 3:1:3 ratio of the upstream flank to the antibiotic resistance cassette to the downstream flank and ligated with T4 DNA ligase. The ligation products were directly used to transform Synechococcus 7002 as described previously (27Frigaard N.U. Sakuragi Y. Bryant D.A. Gene inactivation in the cyanobacterium Synechococcus sp.

To introduce the chlR gene into plasmid pAQ1 of Synechococcus 7002 under control of an inducible promoter, an expression vector having the PnrtABCD promoter of Synechocystis 6803 and aacC1 gene conferring gentamycin resistance was constructed. A 478-bp EcoRI/NdeI fragment comprising the PnrtABCD promoter region of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 and a His tag sequence from pAQ1Ex-ntR (28Xu Y. Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002: a Robust and Versatile Cyanobacterial Platform for Biofuels Development. The Pennsylvania State University, 2010Google Scholar) was cloned into pAQ1cpcEx that had aacC1 as a drug marker, resulting in pLM3. The chlR gene from Synechococcus 7002 was amplified using primers 10 and 11, and the resulting PCR product was cleaved with NcoI and BamHI, resulting in a 199-bp NcoI fragment and a 187-bp NcoI/BamHI fragment. The NcoI/BamHI fragment was first cloned into NcoI/BamHI-digested pLM3 followed by cloning the NcoI fragment into the NcoI-digested pLM3 derivative, finally resulting in pLM4. Both the orientation of the NcoI fragment and the whole PCR-amplified region were confirmed by sequencing. Through NcoI cloning, the His tag-coding sequence of pLM3 was removed, resulting in a non-tagged gene product. However, introduction of the NcoI site at the 5′-end of the chlR gene caused a threonine to alanine exchange of the second amino acid in the resulting protein. The spectinomycin-resistant chlR deletion mutant strain was transformed with ScaI-linearized pLM4. A Strep-tagged variant of ChlR was constructed for expression and subsequent purification from E. coli. An N-terminal Strep tag-coding sequence and restriction sites were fused to the chlR coding sequence by PCR using primers 12 and 13, and the resulting PCR product was cleaved with NdeI and BamHI, resulting in a 422-bp NdeI/BamHI fragment. This fragment was cloned into NdeI/BamHI-digested pET-42b expression vector, yielding pLM5. A reporter construct based on the yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) was designed for testing expression levels from the acsFII promoter sequence. To probe expression in Synechococcus 7002, the acsFII promoter region of Synechocystis 6803 was amplified by PCR using primers 14 and 15. The PCR product was digested with EcoRI and NcoI, and the resulting 581-bp EcoRI/NcoI fragment was cloned into EcoRI/NcoI-digested pLM3, replacing the PnrtABCD promoter and yielding pLM6. Finally, ScaI-linearized pLM6 was transformed into wild-type Synechococcus 7002. For expression experiments in E. coli, a 1515-bp EcoRI/XbaI fragment from pLM6, including the Synechocystis 6803 PacsF-II sequence and yfp, was cloned into an EcoRI/XbaI fragment of pCDFDuetTM-1, which only included the origin of replication and the aadA resistance marker, yielding pLM7. For expression experiments in E. coli, plasmids pLM5 and pLM7 were transformed either separately or together into E. coli BL21(DE3). All expression constructions for Synechococcus 7002 and E. coli were verified by DNA sequencing. RNAsamples for subsequent cDNA library construction were prepared from frozen cell pellets derived from 25-ml aliquots of liquid culture (pooled from three independent cultures). The RNA pr"

The objective of this study was to explore the current state of client referral patterns and practices by community care workers (CCWs), in an evolving environment of one rural South African sub-district. Using a participant triangulation approach, in-depth qualitative interviews were conducted with 17 CCWs, 32 HBC clients and 32 primary caregivers (PCGs). An open-ended interview guide was used for data collection. Participants were selected from comprehensive lists of CCWs and their clients, using a diversified criterion-based sampling method. Three independent researchers coded three sets of data - CCWs, Clients and PCGs, for referral patterns and practices of CCWs. Referrals from clinics and hospitals to HBC occurred infrequently, as only eight (25%) of the 32 clients interviewed were formally referred. Community care workers showed high levels of commitment and personal investment in supporting their clients to use the formal health care system. They went to the extent of using their own personal resources. Seven CCWs used their own money to ensure client access to clinics, and eight gave their own food to ensure treatment adherence. Community care workers are essential in linking clients to clinics and hospitals and to promote the appropriate use of medical services, although this effort frequently necessitated consumption of their own personal resources. Therefore, risk protection strategies are urgently needed so as to ensure sustainability of the current work performed by HBC organizations and the CCW volunteers."
https://openalex.org/W2078848565,"Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a human opportunistic pathogen, is capable of provoking acute and chronic infections that are associated with defined sets of virulence factors. During chronic infections, the bacterium accumulates mutations that silence some and activate other genes. Here we show that the cystic fibrosis isolate CHA exhibits a unique virulence phenotype featuring a mucoid morphology, an active Type III Secretion System (T3SS, hallmark of acute infections), and no Type VI Secretion System (H1-T6SS). This virulence profile is due to a 426 bp deletion in the 3' end of the gacS gene encoding an essential regulatory protein. The absence of GacS disturbs the Gac/Rsm pathway leading to depletion of the small regulatory RNAs RsmY/RsmZ and, in consequence, to expression of T3SS, while switching off the expression of H1-T6SS and Pel polysaccharides. The CHA isolate also exhibits full ability to swim and twitch, due to active flagellum and Type IVa pili. Thus, unlike the classical scheme of balance between virulence factors, clinical strains may adapt to a local niche by expressing both alginate exopolysaccharide, a hallmark of membrane stress that protects from antibiotic action, host defences and phagocytosis, and efficient T3S machinery that is considered as an aggressive virulence factor."
https://openalex.org/W2081190708,"MYH7 (also referred to as cardiac myosin heavy chain β) gene expression is known to be repressed by thyroid hormone (T3). However, the molecular mechanism by which T3 inhibits the transcription of its target genes (negative regulation) remains to be clarified, whereas those of transcriptional activation by T3 (positive regulation) have been elucidated in detail. Two MCAT (muscle C, A, and T) sites and an A/T-rich region in the MYH7 gene have been shown to play a critical role in the expression of this gene and are known to be recognized by the TEAD/TEF family of transcription factors (TEADs). Using a reconstitution system with CV-1 cells, which has been utilized in the analysis of positive as well as negative regulation, we demonstrate that both T3 receptor (TR) β1 and α1 inhibit TEAD-dependent activation of the MYH7 promoter in a T3 dose-dependent manner. TRβ1 bound with GC-1, a TRβ-selective T3 analog, also repressed TEAD-induced activity. Although T3-dependent inhibition required the DNA-binding domain (DBD) of TRβ1, it remained after the putative negative T3-responsive elements were mutated. A co-immunoprecipitation study demonstrated the in vivo association of TRβ1 with TEAD-1, and the interaction surfaces were mapped to the DBD of the TRβ1 and TEA domains of TEAD-1, both of which are highly conserved among TRs and TEADs, respectively. The importance of TEADs in MYH7 expression was also validated with RNA interference using rat embryonic cardiomyocyte H9c2 cells. These results indicate that T3-bound TRs interfere with transactivation by TEADs via protein-protein interactions, resulting in the negative regulation of MYH7 promoter activity."
https://openalex.org/W2092045927,"Electrophysiological oscillations in different frequency bands co-occur with perceptual, motor and cognitive processes but their function and respective contributions to these processes need further investigations. Here, we recorded MEG signals and seek for percept related modulations of alpha, beta and gamma band activity during a perceptual form/motion integration task. Participants reported their bound or unbound perception of ambiguously moving displays that could either be seen as a whole square-like shape moving along a Lissajou's figure (bound percept) or as pairs of bars oscillating independently along cardinal axes (unbound percept). We found that beta (15-25 Hz), but not gamma (55-85 Hz) oscillations, index perceptual states at the individual and group level. The gamma band activity found in the occipital lobe, although significantly higher during visual stimulation than during base line, is similar in all perceptual states. Similarly, decreased alpha activity during visual stimulation is not different for the different percepts. Trial-by-trial classification of perceptual reports based on beta band oscillations was significant in most observers, further supporting the view that modulation of beta power reliably index perceptual integration of form/motion stimuli, even at the individual level."
https://openalex.org/W2019826649,"Förster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) microscopy is a powerful tool used to identify molecular interactions in live or fixed cells using a non-radiative transfer of energy from a donor fluorophore in the excited state to an acceptor fluorophore in close proximity. FRET can be a very sensitive tool to study protein-protein and/or protein-nucleic acids interactions. RNA toxicity is implicated in a number of disorders; especially those associated with expanded repeat sequences, such as myotonic dystrophy. Myotonic dystrophy (DM1) is caused by a (CTG)n repeat expansion in the 3′ UTR of the DMPK gene which results in nuclear retention of mutant DMPK transcripts in RNA foci. This results in toxic gain-of-function effects mediated through altered functions of RNA-binding proteins (e.g. MBNL1, hnRNPH, CUGBP1). In this study we demonstrate the potential of a new acceptor photobleaching assay to measure FRET (AP-FRET) between RNA and protein. We chose to focus on the interaction between MBNL1 and mutant DMPK mRNA in cells from DM1 patients due to the strong microscopic evidence of their co-localization. Using this technique we have direct evidence of intracellular interaction between MBNL1 and the DMPK RNA. Furthermore using the AP-FRET assay and MBNL1 mutants, we show that all four zinc-finger motifs in MBNL1 are crucial for MBNL1-RNA foci interactions. The data derived using this new assay provides compelling evidence for the interaction between RNA binding proteins and RNA foci, and mechanistic insights into MBNL1-RNA foci interaction demonstrating the power of AP-FRET in examining RNA-Protein interactions in DM1."
https://openalex.org/W1984622482,"Previous research has shown that perceivers can accurately extract information about perceptually ambiguous group memberships from facial information alone. For example, people demonstrate above-chance accuracy in categorizing political ideology from faces. Further, they ascribe particular personality traits to faces according to political party (e.g., Republicans are dominant and mature, Democrats are likeable and trustworthy). Here, we report three studies that replicated and extended these effects. In Study 1a, we provide evidence that, in addition to showing accuracy in categorization, politically-conservative participants expressed a bias toward categorizing targets as outgroup members. In Study 1b, we replicate this relationship with a larger sample and a stimulus set consisting of faces of professional politicians. In Study 2, we find that trait ascriptions based on target political affiliation are moderated by perceiver political ideology. Specifically, although Democrats are stereotyped as more likeable and trustworthy, conservative participants rated faces that were categorized as Republicans in Study 1a as more likeable and trustworthy than faces categorized as Democrats. Thus, this paper joins a growing literature showing that it is critical to consider perceiver identity in examining perceptions of identities and traits from faces."
https://openalex.org/W2034312989,"Spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR) constitutes a genetic model widely used to study the natural evolution of hypertensive heart disease. Ca2+-handling alterations are known to occur in SHR. However, the putative modifications of Ca2+-handling proteins during the progression to heart failure (HF) are not well established. Moreover, the role of apoptosis in SHR is controversial. We investigated intracellular Ca2+, Ca2+-handling proteins and apoptosis in SHR vs. control Wistar rats (W) from 3 to 15 months (mo). Changes associated with the transition to HF (i.e. lung edema and decrease in midwall fractional shortening), occurred at 15 mo in 38% of SHR (SHRF). In SHRF, twitch and caffeine-induced Ca2+ transients, significantly decreased relative to 6/9 mo and 15 mo without HF signs. This decrease occurred in association with a decrease in the time constant of caffeine-Ca2+ transient decay and an increase in Na+/Ca2+ exchanger (NCX) abundance (p<0.05) with no changes in SERCA2a expression/activity. An increased Ca2+-calmodulin-kinase II activity, associated with an enhancement of apoptosis (TUNEL and Bax/Bcl2) was observed in SHR relative to W from 3 to 15 mo. Conclusions: 1. Apoptosis is an early and persistent event that may contribute to hypertrophic remodeling but would not participate in the contractile impairment of SHRF. 2. The increase in NCX expression/activity, associated with an increase in Ca2+ efflux from the cell, constitutes a primary alteration of Ca2+-handling proteins in the evolution to HF. 3. No changes in SERCA2a expression/activity are observed when HF signs become evident."
https://openalex.org/W2077534694,"Deepening of the upper eyelid sulcus (DUES) is a common complication of prostaglandin F2α analog treatment, which causes cosmetic problems. However, identifying this condition using photographs is difficult due to such problems as the camera flash effects, blepharoptosis or wide-open eyes.We investigated the association between a DUES-like appearance and wide-open eyes regarding the presence of wide-open eyes as a cause for overestimating the incidence of DUES.One eye and the forehead in 100 subjects (31 younger subjects, 30 older subjects and 39 patients with blepharoptosis) were evaluated in the present study. Digital photographs of the subjects with natural open and wide-open eyes were taken with a flash. Five signs (a puffy eyelid, the presence/absence of the upper eyelid sulcus (UES), wrinkles on the forehead with natural open eyes and an increase in the number of wrinkles on the forehead and a DUES-like appearance with wide-open eyes) were judged to be negative or positive by three independent observers. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to determine the independent predictor(s) of a DUES-like appearance with wide-open eyes.Fourteen subjects (four young, three old and seven subjects with blepharoptosis) were judged to have a DUES-like appearance with wide-open eyes (14%). The only predictive factor was the presence of UES in the patients with natural open eyes (odds ratio = 17.244, 95% confidence interval: 3.447-86.270, P<0.001). Among the 12 UES-positive subjects, six (50%) exhibited a DUES-like appearance with wide-open eyes.The presence of wide-open eyes can thus cause a DUES-like appearance. Blepharoptosis itself is not a predictive factor; however, care should be taken not to overestimate the incidence of DUES, especially in patients with UES with natural open eyes, as a DUES-like appearance can be caused by wide-open eyes, even in treatment-naïve patients.UMIN000010500."
https://openalex.org/W2005622275,"Immunosuppression associated with infections of nematode parasites has been documented. Cysteine protease inhibitor (CPI) released by the nematode parasites is identified as one of the major modulators of host immune response. In this report, we demonstrated that the recombinant CPI protein of Ascaris lumbricoides (Al-CPI) strongly inhibited the activities of cathepsin L, C, S, and showed weaker effect to cathepsin B. Crystal structure of Al-CPI was determined to 2.1 Å resolution. Two segments of Al-CPI, loop 1 and loop 2, were proposed as the key structure motifs responsible for Al-CPI binding with proteases and its inhibitory activity. Mutations at loop 1 and loop 2 abrogated the protease inhibition activity to various extents. These results provide the molecular insight into the interaction between the nematode parasite and its host and will facilitate the development of anthelmintic agents or design of anti-autoimmune disease drugs."
https://openalex.org/W2068213275,"Objective Estimation of glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) is one of the current clinical methods for identifying risk for diabetic nephropathy in subjects with type 1 diabetes (T1D). Hyperglycemia is known to influence GFR in T1D and variability in blood glucose at the time of eGFR measurement could introduce bias in eGFR. We hypothesized that simultaneously measured blood glucose would influence eGFR in adults with T1D. Methods Longitudinal multivariable mixed-models were employed to investigate the relationships between blood glucose and eGFR by CKD-EPI eGFRCYSTATIN C over 6-years in the Coronary Artery Calcification in Type 1 diabetes (CACTI) study. All subjects with T1D and complete data including blood glucose and cystatin C for at least one of the three visits (n = 616, 554, and 521, respectively) were included in the longitudinal analyses. Results In mixed-models adjusting for sex, HbA1c, ACEi/ARB, protein and sodium intake positive associations were observed between simultaneous blood glucose and eGFRCYSTATIN C (β±SE:0.14±0.04 per 10 mg/dL of blood glucose, p<0.0001), and hyperfiltration as a dichotomous outcome (OR: 1.04, 95% CI: 1.01–1.07 per 10 mg/dL of blood glucose, p = 0.02). Conclusions In our longitudinal data in subjects with T1D, simultaneous blood glucose has an independent positive effect on eGFRCYSTATIN C. The associations between blood glucose and eGFRCYSTATIN C may bias the accurate detection of early diabetic nephropathy, especially in people with longitudinal variability in blood glucose."
https://openalex.org/W2038211385,"We study formation of ostracism in a society from a game theoretical perspective. The dynamics of group formation is complicated in that the choices of the individuals and the form of the groups mutually affect each other in the process. A suggested simple model shows that individual efforts to increase his/her own sense of belonging is responsible for both growth of groups and creation of an outcast. Once a person happens to get behind in synchronizing with others, tendency to alienate him may grow among others, possibly making him left out in the end. Alienating minority occurs even when there is a penalty for disliking and people are encouraged to favor others. Considering that the target is accidentally picked, we can understand ostracism as an inherent part of the group formation, rather than a result of specific discrepancy among people. Another finding is that a single individual who seeks for unconditional unification of the society (“philanthropist”) likely invites his/her own isolation from the society, while the existence of such person generally promotes coalition of others."

The cornea was photographed using a high-speed camera at 5,000 frames/sec during non-contact tonometry without contact lenses (NCL), with -5.0 diopters (D), -0.5 D and +5.0 D CL. The displacement of the ocular surface and the factors affecting displacement at the IOP reading and maximum displacement time were investigated.The IOP readings while wearing +5 D CL were significantly higher than those obtained while wearing -5 D CL. The ocular surface displacement between +5 D CL and other groups were significantly different. A significant positive correlation was found between the ocular surface displacement of subjects at the IOP reading time and the IOP obtained with the non-contact tonometer. A significant negative correlation was found between the ocular surface curvature and the IOP obtained using the non-contact tonometer. The radius of curvature of the ocular surface affected the displacement during the IOP reading and maximum displacement time.Our results indicate that soft contact lens use changes the ocular surface behavior and IOP readings during non-contact tonometry. The radius of curvature of the eye affects the ocular surface displacement and IOP readings in this situation."

PN’s feature a unique design where a single PEG polymer surrounds a short fluorochrome and radiometal bearing peptide, and endows the resulting nanoprobe with pharmacokinetic control (based on molecular weight of the PEG selected) and optical tunability (based on the fluorochrome selected), while the chelate provides a radiolabeling option. PN’s were used to image brain capillary angiography (intravital 2-photon microscopy), tumor capillary permeability (intravital fluorescent microscopy), and the tumor enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect (111In-PN and SPECT). Clinical applications of PN’s include use as long blood half-life fluorochromes for intraoperative angiography, for measurements of capillary permeability in breast cancer lesions, and to image EPR by SPECT, for stratifying patient candidates for long-circulating nanomedicines that may utilize the EPR mechanism."
