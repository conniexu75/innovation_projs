https://openalex.org/W2042196073,"During 1975, westward-moving long waves with a period of about 25 days and a wavelength of 1000 kilometers were observed at a sea surface temperature front in the equatorial Pacific on infrared images obtained by a geostationary environmental satellite system. The absence of these waves during 1976, and the above-average equatorial sea surface temperatures during 1976, may be related to a decrease in the southeasterly trade winds during that year."

https://openalex.org/W2005308775,"A central receiver illuminated by a field of heliostats can absorb 10 to 100 megawatts of sunlight at 600/sup 0/ to 1000/sup 0/K. The following are discussed: the plan of the solar thermal power system or solar power tower based on optical transmission, the history of the solar tower, the receiver subsystem, the design of the heliostats and their placement in a field, thermal storage, environmental concerns, and economics."
https://openalex.org/W2056708801,Lectin is released from soybean seeds during water uptake. Hemagglutination activity data show that the lectin is a preferential release product within the first 8 hours of hydration. A qualitative filter-paper assay for detection of lectin released by single seeds is used to show that the release phenomenon is independent of seed viability and insensitive to azide.

https://openalex.org/W2070119777,"Counts of meteors observed by radar from Christchurch, New Zealand, rose unexpectedly by over 100 percent during mid-1963. A similar but smaller increase was also observed in Canada. Diminishing peaks have subsequently appeared at 6-month intervals in the Christchurch meteor counts."
https://openalex.org/W1975024084,"Benefit-cost analyses for water projects generally have not included the expected costs (residual risk) of low-probability disasters such as dam failures, impoundment-induced earthquakes, and landslides. Analysis of the history of these types of events demonstrates that dam failures are not uncommon and that the probability of a reservoir-triggered earthquake increases with increasing reservoir depth. Because the expected costs from such events can be significant and risk is project-specific, estimates should be made for each project. The cost of expected damage from a ""high-risk"" project in an urban area could be comparable to project benefits."
https://openalex.org/W37501281,"The observation that the magnetic flux in a hollow superconducting cylinder is quantized in units of hc/2e has confirmed Fritz London's prediction that superconductivity is a macroscopic quantum phenomenon and that the superconducting state is a single- valued quantum state. It has also conclusively demonstrated that the pair interaction of the Bardeen-Cooper- Schrieffer theory of superconductivity is the important one, at least for the few superconductors studied. A superconducting ring or hollow cylinder must ""decide"" at the transition temperature what final quantum state it will be in when the temperature is lowered. This ""thinking process"" has been observed in experiments which demonstrate that the free energy of a hollow superconducting cylinder at the transition temperature is periodic in the magnetic flux. Very recently quantum-mechanical interference effects have been observed in the Josephson tunneling characteristics of multiply linked superconducting circuits. These experiments complement the other experiments on quantized flux and provide perhaps the most elegant proof of long-range order in the superconducting state."

https://openalex.org/W2037953883,"Five months after the announcement of President Carter's nonproliferation policy, the common wisdom in this country is that Europe has hardly wavered in its rush toward nuclear power. The cry that ""Europe will do what it wants whether the United States builds a breeder or not"" is often heard from American nuclear interests, with apparent justification as the State Department has shown little visible progress in negotiating new agreements and some signs of retreating from its original goals."

https://openalex.org/W2083396422,"A 12-kilocycle pulsed transducer, with a 0.1 millisecond duration, is used for tracing a sub-bottom rock profile in Narragansett Bay. The short sonar pulse of high energy is produced by a capacitor discharge. Over-the-side installation of the transducer permits the use of any boat or ship for the survey work. Coherent presentation of the data on a wet paper recorder gives an instantaneous visual record. A cross a north-south rock formation, a recurring rise and fall of the rock is shown throughout the sedimentary deposit."
