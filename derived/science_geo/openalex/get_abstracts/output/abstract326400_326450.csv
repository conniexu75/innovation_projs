https://openalex.org/W2009735920,Inputs of pollutant lead to the Gulf of Mexico from the Mississippi River have declined by about 40 percent within the past decade. This decrease has been determined from annual lead loads of the Mississippi River and from the lead record in Mississippi Delta sediments. The observed trend is consistent with reduced consumption of lead in gasoline in the United States. More than 90 percent of the riverborne lead is associated with suspended sediments. Most of this particle-bound lead is deposited within 50 kilometers of the river mouth and is not easily leached at pH values above 3.

The initial epsilon neodymium values for 15 whole rocks are similar to those for average upper continental crust, falling on the crustal trend of neodymium isotopic evolution as defined by shales. The rare earth element concentration patterns of Sudbury rocks are also similar to upper crustal averages. These data suggest that the Sudbury Complex formed from melts generated in the upper crust and are consistent with a meteoritic impact."

In this study it was found that roots of the mutant pea ;Ageotropum' are neither gravitropic nor phototropic, but do respond tropically to a moisture gradient, making them an ideal subject for the study of hydrotropism. When the root caps were removed, elongation was not affected but hydrotropism was blocked, suggesting that the site of sensory perception resides in the root cap."

A membrane fraction was obtained from degreened cells that was active in this conversion only when phenanthroline was present. Untreated cells excreted protochlorophyllide, which was used as substrate for this in vitro reaction. This system may provide a clue to how chlorophyllide b is synthesized in plant cells."

Even Africa has ample land and technology to feed its population, given more effective national policies. Higher agricultural output has been stimulated primarily by new technology, but also by investments and improved government policies. Constraints such as cropland shortage, soil erosion, and higher oil prices have been readily surmounted. High-technology agriculture has even overcome some major ""systems breaks."" Thus U.S. farmers will continue to face commercial surpluses of farm products in world markets in the years ahead."

https://openalex.org/W2058906173,"Modern experimental techniques for measuring rate parameters of elementary reactions have transformed the field of gas-phase reaction kinetics from one of indirect inference to one of direct determination. Recent progress in the principal techniques is described, a few examples are given of the hundreds of elementary reactions for which rate information has become available, and comparison with reaction rate theory is briefly discussed. Some generalizations regarding the dependence of rate parameters on structure and thermodynamics are drawn, and successful applications to atmospheric and combustion modeling and measurement are presented."

https://openalex.org/W4235924971,"In the article ""String as a theory of everything"" by M. Mitchell Waldrop (Research News, 20 Sept., p. 1251), the last line of the first column was inadvertantly omitted. The affected sentence should have read, ""Not only were the strong interactions far more complex than predicted by field theory, but the particles that participated in the strong interactions-the hadrons, a group that includes protons, neutrons, pi mesons, and many others-seemed to be relatively large, extended objects as much as 1 Fermi across (10(-13) centimeter)."" In the next-to-the-last line of the second full paragraph in column 2 on page 1252, 10(-19) should have been 10(+19). Finally, the words ""quandary"" (page 1251, column 1, paragraph 6, line 2) and ""quark"" (page 1252, column 3, last paragraph, line 18) were misspelled."
