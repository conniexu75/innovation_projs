https://openalex.org/W2106095564,"Transporter-facilitated uptake of serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine or 5-HT) has been implicated in anxiety in humans and animal models and is the site of action of widely used uptake-inhibiting antidepressant and antianxiety drugs. Human 5-HT transporter (5-HTT) gene transcription is modulated by a common polymorphism in its upstream regulatory region. The short variant of the polymorphism reduces the transcriptional efficiency of the 5-HTT gene promoter, resulting in decreased 5-HTT expression and 5-HT uptake in lymphoblasts. Association studies in two independent samples totaling 505 individuals revealed that the 5-HTT polymorphism accounts for 3 to 4 percent of total variation and 7 to 9 percent of inherited variance in anxiety-related personality traits in individuals as well as sibships."

https://openalex.org/W2069186336,"We have developed a genetic approach to visualize axons from olfactory sensory neurons expressing a given odorant receptor, as they project to the olfactory bulb. Neurons expressing a specific receptor project to only two topographically fixed loci among the 1800 glomeruli in the mouse olfactory bulb. Our data provide direct support for a model in which a topographic map of receptor activation encodes odor quality in the olfactory bulb. Receptor swap experiments suggest that the olfactory receptor plays an instructive role in the guidance process but cannot be the sole determinant in the establishment of this map. This genetic approach may be more broadly applied to visualize the development and plasticity of projections in the mammalian nervous system."
https://openalex.org/W1972091733,"A nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)-based method is described in which small organic molecules that bind to proximal subsites of a protein are identified, optimized, and linked together to produce high-affinity ligands. The approach is called ""SAR by NMR"" because structure-activity relationships (SAR) are obtained from NMR. With this technique, compounds with nanomolar affinities for the FK506 binding protein were rapidly discovered by tethering two ligands with micromolar affinities. The method reduces the amount of chemical synthesis and time required for the discovery of high-affinity ligands and appears particularly useful in target-directed drug research."
https://openalex.org/W1982087641,"Antibodies that block Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) signaling have been used to show that SHH activity is required for the induction of floor plate differentiation by the notochord and independently for the induction of motor neurons by both the notochord and midline neural cells. Motor neuron generation depends on two critical periods of SHH signaling: an early period during which naive neural plate cells are converted into ventralized progenitors and a late period that extends well into S phase of the final progenitor cell division, during which SHH drives the differentiation of ventralized progenitors into motor neurons. The ambient SHH concentration during the late period determines whether ventralized progenitors differentiate into motor neurons or interneurons, thus defining the pattern of neuronal cell types generated in the neural tube."
https://openalex.org/W1970396586,"The Drosophila eye has contributed much to our knowledge of cell differentiation. This understanding has primarily come from the study of the R7 photoreceptor; much less is known about the development of the other classes of photoreceptor or the nonneuronal cone or pigment cells. I have used a dominant-negative form of the Drosophila epidermal growth factor receptor (DER) to show that this receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) is required for the differentiation of all these cell types, and I have also shown that DER is sufficient to trigger their development. DER is even required in R7, where it can replace Sevenless, another RTK. These results broaden our view of eye development to include the whole ommatidium and suggest that reiterative activation of DER is critical for triggering the differentiation of all cell types."

https://openalex.org/W2032950588,"Mutations at the mouse tottering (tg) locus cause a delayed-onset, recessive neurological disorder resulting in ataxia, motor seizures, and behavioral absence seizures resembling petit mal epilepsy in humans. A more severe allele, leaner (tgla), also shows a slow, selective degeneration of cerebellar neurons. By positional cloning, we have identified an α1A voltage-sensitive calcium channel gene that is mutated in tg and tgla mice. The α1A gene is widely expressed in the central nervous system with prominent, uniform expression in the cerebellum. α1A expression does not mirror the localized pattern of cerebellar degeneration observed in tgla mice, providing evidence for regional differences in biological function of α1A channels. These studies define the first mutations in a mammalian central nervous system–specific voltage-sensitive calcium channel and identify the first gene involved in absence epilepsy."
https://openalex.org/W2098573045,"We provide evidence that a class of integrins combines with the adaptor Shc and thereby with Grb2. Coimmunoprecipitation and mutagenesis experiments indicate that the recruitment of Shc is specified by the extracellular or transmembrane domain of integrin α subunit and suggest that this process is mediated by caveolin. Mutagenesis and dominant-negative inhibition studies reveal that Shc is necessary and sufficient for activation of the MAP kinase pathway in response to integrin ligation. Mitogens and Shc-activating integrins cooperate to promote transcription from the Fos serum response element and transit through G1. In contrast, adhesion mediated by integrins not linked to Shc results in cell cycle arrest and apoptosis even in presence of mitogens. These findings indicate that the association of specific integrins with Shc regulates cell survival and cell cycle progression."
https://openalex.org/W1982721874,"The CBFβ subunit is the non-DNA-binding subunit of the heterodimeric core-binding factor (CBF). CBFβ associates with DNA-binding CBFα subunits and increases their affinity for DNA. Genes encoding the CBFβ subunit (CBFB) and one of the CBFα subunits (CBFA2, otherwise known as AML1) are the most frequent targets of chromosomal translocations in acute leukemias in humans. We and others previously demonstrated that homozygous disruption of the mouse Cbfa2 (AML1) gene results in embryonic lethality at midgestation due to hemorrhaging in the central nervous system and blocks fetal liver hematopoiesis. Here we demonstrate that homozygous mutation of the Cbfb gene results in the same phenotype. Our results demonstrate that the CBFβ subunit is required for CBFα2 function in vivo."

https://openalex.org/W1975935787,"Plasmin(ogen) is an extracellular serine protease implicated in the activation of latent growth factors and procollagenase, degradation of extracellular matrix components, and fibrin clearance. Plasminogen (Plg) deficiency in mice results in high mortality, wasting, spontaneous gastrointestinal ulceration, rectal prolapse, and severe thrombosis. Furthermore, Plg-deficient mice display delayed wound healing following skin injury, a defect partly related to impaired keratinocyte migration. We generated mice deficient in Plg and fibrinogen (Fib) and show that removal of fibrin(ogen) from the extracellular environment alleviates the diverse spontaneous pathologies previously associated with Plg deficiency and corrects healing times. Mice deficient in Plg and Fib are phenotypically indistinguishable from Fib-deficient mice. These data suggest that the fundamental and possibly only essential physiological role of Plg is fibrinolysis."

https://openalex.org/W2157729659,"The heterotrimeric Sec61p complex is a major component of the protein-conducting channel of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane, associating with either ribosomes or the Sec62/63 complex to perform co- and posttranslational transport, respectively. We show by electron microscopy that purified mammalian and yeast Sec61p complexes in detergent form cylindrical oligomers with a diameter of approximately 85 A and a central pore of approximately 20 A. Each oligomer contains 3-4 heterotrimers. Similar ring structures are seen in reconstituted proteoliposomes and native membranes. Oligomer formation by the reconstituted Sec61p complex is stimulated by its association with ribosomes or the Sec62/63p complex. We propose that these cylindrical oligomers represent protein-conducting channels of the ER, formed by ligands specific for co- and posttranslational transport."

https://openalex.org/W2067040747,"The fusion oncogene CBFB-MYH11 is generated by a chromosome 16 inversion in human acute myeloid leukemia subtype M4Eo. Mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells heterozygous for this oncogene were generated by inserting part of the human MYH11 cDNA into the mouse Cbfb gene through homologous recombination (knock-in). Chimeric mice were leukemia free, but the ES cells with the knocked-in Cbfb-MYH11 gene did not contribute to their hematopoietic tissues. Mouse embryos heterozygous for Cbfb-MYH11 lacked definitive hematopoiesis and developed multiple fatal hemorrhages around embryonic day 12.5. This phenotype is very similar to that resulting from homozygous deletions of either Cbfb or Cbfa2 (AML1), consistent with a dominant negative function of the Cbfb-MYH11 fusion oncogene. An impairment of primitive hematopoiesis was also observed, however, suggesting a possible additional function of Cbfb-MYH11."
https://openalex.org/W2055875053,"Progression to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) has been related to exhaustion of the regenerative capacity of the immune system resulting from high T cell turnover. Analysis of telomeric terminal restriction fragment (TRF) length, a marker for cellular replicative history, showed that CD8(+) T cell TRF length decreased but CD4(+) T cell TRF length was stable during the course of human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1) infection, which was not explained by differential telomerase activity. This observation provides evidence that turnover in the course of HIV-1 infection can be increased considerably in CD8(+) T cells, but not in CD4(+) T cells. These results are compatible with CD4(+) T cell decline in HIV-1 infection caused by interference with cell renewal."
https://openalex.org/W2046621665,"The Arabidopsis gene AGAMOUS is required for male and female reproductive organ development and for floral determinacy. Reverse genetics allowed the isolation of a transposon-induced mutation in ZAG1, the maize homolog of AGAMOUS. ZAG1 mutants exhibited a loss of determinacy, but the identity of reproductive organs was largely unaffected. This suggested a redundancy in maize sex organ specification that led to the identification and cloning of a second AGAMOUS homolog, ZMM2, that has a pattern of expression distinct from that of ZAG1. C-function organ identity in maize (as defined by the A, B, C model of floral organ development) may therefore be orchestrated by two closely related genes, ZAG1 and ZMM2, with overlapping but nonidentical activities."
https://openalex.org/W2057446176,"A solid phase carbohydrate library was synthesized and screened against Bauhinia purpurea lectin. The library, which contains approximately 1300 di- and trisaccharides, was synthesized with chemical encoding on TentaGel resin so that each bead contained a single carbohydrate. Two ligands that bind more tightly to the lectin than Gal-beta-1,3-GalNAc (the known ligand) have been identified. The strategy outlined can be used to identify carbohydrate-based ligands for any receptor; however, because the derivatized beads mimic the polyvalent presentation of cell surface carbohydrates, the screen may prove especially valuable for discovering new compounds that bind to proteins participating in cell adhesion."

https://openalex.org/W2139572341,"Cell division and subsequent programmed cell death in imaginal discs of Drosophila larvae determine the final size of organs and structures of the adult fly. We show here that nitric oxide (NO) is involved in controlling the size of body structures during Drosophila development. We have found that NO synthase (NOS) is expressed at high levels in developing imaginal discs. Inhibition of NOS in larvae causes hypertrophy of organs and their segments in adult flies, whereas ectopic expression of NOS in larvae has the opposite effect. Blocking apoptosis in eye imaginal discs unmasks surplus cell proliferation and results in an increase in the number of ommatidia and component cells of individual ommatidia. These results argue that NO acts as an antiproliferative agent during Drosophila development, controlling the balance between cell proliferation and cell differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W2090117717,"The proteins encoded by the myc proto-oncogene family are involved in cell proliferation, apoptosis, differentiation, and neoplasia. Myc acts through dimerization with Max to bind DNA and activate transcription. Homologs of the myc and max genes were cloned from the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster and their protein products (dMyc and dMax) were shown to heterodimerize, recognize the same DNA sequence as their vertebrate homologs, and activate transcription. The dMyc protein is likely encoded by the Drosophila gene diminutive (dm), a mutation in which results in small body size and female sterility caused by degeneration of the ovaries. These findings indicate a potential role for Myc in germ cell development and set the stage for genetic analysis of Myc and Max."

https://openalex.org/W1995215326,"In flowering plants, a series of cell-cell interactions govern the delivery of sperm to the ovules through precise guidance of pollen tubes. Two Arabidopsis genes, POP2 and POP3, were found that mediate pollen tube guidance and are critical for self-fertility in diploid reproductive cells. The pop2 and pop3 mutations exhibited genetic redundancy: Self-sterility occurred only when male and female tissues were defective in both genes. This phenotype resembles that found in many self-incompatible species."

https://openalex.org/W1987829518,"A 13.1-kilodalton protein, cysteine-rich neurotrophic factor (CRNF), was purified from the mollusk Lymnaea stagnalis by use of a binding assay on the p75 neurotrophin receptor. CRNF bound to p75 with nanomolar affinity but was not similar in sequence to neurotrophins or any other known gene product. CRNF messenger RNA expression was highest in adult foot subepithelial cells; in the central nervous system, expression was regulated by lesion. The factor evoked neurite outgrowth and modulated calcium currents in pedal motor neurons. Thus, CRNF may be involved in target-derived trophic support for motor neurons and could represent the prototype of another family of p75 ligands."

https://openalex.org/W2009700107,"3'-End formation of pre-mRNA in yeast and mammals follows a similar but distinct pathway. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the cleavage reaction can be reconstituted by two activities called cleavage factor I and II (CFI and CFII). A CFII component, designated CFT1 (cleavage factor two) was identified by its sequence similarity to the AAUAAA-binding subunit of the mammalian cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor (CPSF), even though the AAUAAA signal sequence appears to play no role in yeast pre-mRNA 3' processing. Depletion of a yeast whole-cell extract with antibodies to CFT1 protein abolished cleavage and polyadenylation of pre-mRNAs. Addition of CFII restored cleavage activity, but not polyadenylation. Polyadenylation required the further addition of poly(A) polymerase and polyadenylation factor I, suggesting a close but not necessarily direct association of these two factors with the CFT1 protein."
