https://openalex.org/W1652473508,"1) Induction of humoral antibody formation involves the obligatory recognition of two determinants on an antigen, one by the receptor antibody of the antigen-sensitive cell and the other by carrier antibody (associative interaction). 2) Paralysis of antibody formation involves the obligatory recognition of only one determinant by the receptor antibody of the antigen-sensitive cell; that is, a nonimmunogenic molecule (a hapten) can paralyze antigen-sensitive cells. 3) There is competition between paralysis and induction at the level of the antigen-sensitive cell. 4) The mechanisms of low- and high-zone paralysis, and maintenance of the unresponsive state, are identical. 5) High-zone paralysis occurs when both the carrier antibody and the receptor antibody are saturated, so that associated interactions cannot take place. 6) The mechanisms of paralysis and induction for the carrier-antigen-sensitive cell are identical to those for the humoral-antigen-sensitive cell. 7) The formation of carrier-antigen-sensitive cells is thymus-dependent, whereas humoral-antigen-sensitive cells are derived from bone marrow. Since carrier antibody is required for induction, all antigens are thymus-dependent. 8) The interaction of antigen with the receptor antibody on an antigen-sensitive cell results in a conformational change in an invariant region of the receptor and consequently paralyzes the cell. As the receptor is probably identical to the induced antibody, all antibody molecules are expected to be able to undergo a conformational change on binding a hapten. The obligatory associated recognition by way of carrier antibody (inductive signal) involves a conformational change in the carrier antibody, leading to a second signal to the antigen-sensitive cell. 9) The foregoing requirements provide an explanation for self-nonself discrimination. Tolerance to self-antigens involves a specific deletion in the activity of both the humoral- and the carrier-antigen-sensitive cells."

Two hours after the injection of LRF, components of female sexual behavior appeared. The lordosis reflex followed mounting by the male, and darting and hopping behavior was quite prevalent. On the other hand, treatment with estrogen followed by luteinizing hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone, or thyrotropin-releasing factor did not induce copulatory behavior. The results suggest that LRF may play a role in induction of mating behavior."

https://openalex.org/W1518601851,"The kinetics of diphtheria toxin production by a mutant of the C7(β) strain of Corynebacterium diphtheriae has been studied. This strain, C7-262(β), produces unusually low yields of toxin, although its β-prophage carries a normal tox gene. The isolation of five strains of β-phage, each carrying a different mutation of its tox gene, is described. Lysogens carrying these mutants as prophages produce altered extracellular proteins (cross-reacting materials), serologically related to toxin, each of which has been isolated in purified form. Two of them, cross-reacting materials 30 and 45, are of lower molecular weight than toxin. Although Fragment A, which contains the enzymically active NH2-terminal region of the molecule, isolated from these mutant proteins could not be distinguished from Fragment A derived from toxin itself, cross-reacting materials 30 and 45 are nontoxic for susceptible animals. The other three mutant proteins are serologically indistinguishable from wild type toxin. Cross-reactive materials 197 and 228 are nontoxic because of amino acid substitutions in the Fragment A portion of the molecule causing loss of enzymic activity. Cross-reacting material 176 contains an altered Fragment A which retains about 8 to 10% of the enzymic activity of the wild type. In vivo, however, cross-reacting material 176 is only 0.2 to 0.4% as toxic as intact toxin."

https://openalex.org/W1543969063,"Abstract The kinetic data of entry of Fragment A from diphtheria toxin and Fragment A176 derived from the serologically related protein of reduced toxicity, cross-reacting material 176, across the living HeLa cell membrane have been studied by following the rate of inactivation of the HeLa cell protein-synthesizing system. Similar kinetic studies have been carried out on the competition between toxin and the two nontoxic, serologically related proteins, cross-reacting materials 197 and 228. It is suggested that there are entry sites on the HeLa cell membrane that specifically interact with the Fragment B part of the molecule. It is concluded that Fragment A from toxin and related mutant proteins is crossing the cell membrane continuously to reach a steady state level in which the rate of entry is balanced by the rate of degradation in the cytoplasm. A maximum intracellular level is reached when all of the entry sites become saturated. Saturation of sites is approached at toxin concentrations of 5 x 10-7 m or higher."
https://openalex.org/W1572641545,"Abstract Glucokinase that appears in normal rat liver after the 16th postnatal day was evoked prematurely, a week earlier, by three injections of hydrocortisone (one per day for 3 days) followed by an injection of glucose. As a result of such treatment 9-day-old rats can exhibit as much glucokinase activity as seen in 21-day-old control rats. The prematurely induced rise of glucokinase in developing rats was prevented by actinomycin, by mannoheptulose, or by estradiol administered 6 hours before each hydrocortisone injection. The normal developmental accumulation of glucokinase was partially inhibited by adrenalectomy, by preventing access to solid food, and by treatment with estradiol. The results suggest that adrenocortical secretion (known to increase after the 10th postnatal day) and the intake of solid food (starting after the 13th day) are the physiological stimuli that trigger the formation of glucokinase in normal rats. Our inability to evoke glucokinase before the 5th day may be due to the presence of estrogen in the newborn organism. The prenatal and postnatal levels of liver hexokinase are also presented; there were no changes observed as a result of any of the treatments that altered the levels of glucokinase."

The transport rate is the same as that observed for proteins labeled after intraocular injection of tritiated proline.

https://openalex.org/W2152853216,"The subunit structure of thyroglobulin has been investigated by gel filtration and polyacrylamide electrophoresis in sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) of the native and the S-carboxymethylated proteins. When the thyroglobulins from several species (calf, sheep, pig, man, rat, and guinea pig) were examined by polyacrylamide electrophoresis in SDS in the absence of reducing agents, most of the protein was distributed between two components which appeared to be the half- and the undissociated molecule. However, smaller components with molecular weights ranging down to 20,000 were also detected in the polyacrylamide gels. These represented about 20% of the total protein and could be separated from the larger subunits by filtration on agarose columns (Bio-Gel A-15m), which also succeeded in separating the intact and half-molecules. Polyacrylamide electrophoresis of the thyroglobulins in the presence of both SDS and mercaptoethanol indicated the existence of a large number of subunits. The two most prominent components of the calf protein had molecular weights of 215,000 and 190,000, but others with molecular weights from 235,000 to 30,000 were also found. Bio-Gel A-15m filtration of the S-carboxymethylated protein in SDS permitted separation of the subunits with molecular weights of approximately 200,000 from those of smaller size, which after disulfide bond cleavage represented approximately 40% of the protein. Separation on Bio-Gel A-5m of the 27 S and 19 S forms of calf thyroglobulin which are present in the protein purified by phosphate buffer fractionation made it possible to demonstrate that both had similar subunit patterns when examined by SDS-polyacrylamide electrophoresis in the presence of mercaptoethanol. The distribution of the protein among the components seen on SDS-polyacrylamide electrophoresis was determined from the total amino acids present in the separated bands, and the relative number of moles of each was calculated. This indicated a nonstoichiometric relationship among the subunits. NH2-terminal analyses performed on the fractions obtained by Bio-Gel A-15m filtration of the SDS-treated native calf thyroglobulin and the reduced-alkylated protein showed that the disulfide-bonded molecules present in the native protein contain almost as many NH2-terminal amino acids as the intact protein. In contrast, the 200,000 molecular weight subunits of the reduced-alkylated protein have insufficient NH2-terminal amino acids for their molecular weight, suggesting the presence in them of blocked terminal residues, while the small molecular weight components are enriched in this respect compared to the original thyroglobulin. The nonstoichiometry of both the subunits and the NH2-terminal amino acids may be explained by the presence in this large molecule of fragments of varying length both noncovalently and disulfide-bonded to the larger subunits. 14C-Labeled rat thyroglobulin was shown to have radioactivity in both large and small subunits and the distribution was similar when the protein was isolated at 1 and 3 hours after the injection of labeled leucine. Comparable findings were obtained with 14C-labeled calf thyroglobulin prepared by incubation of thyroid slices with radioactive leucine for varying periods of time. This suggested that the cleavage of thyroglobulin to yield the diversity of subunits observed occurs at some stage during the synthesis or maturation of the molecule rather than during its storage. The possibility of endogenous proteolysis during thyroglobulin preparation as a cause of subunit heterogeneity was considered unlikely, since incubation of the thyroid slices or of the thyroglobulin itself at pH 6.8 had no effect on the polyacrylamide electrophoretic pattern observed. The free mobilities of the thyroglobulin subunits during SDS-polyacrylamide electrophoresis were shown to be somewhat lower than those of the standard proteins used and the molecular weights calculated for some of the subunits depended on the gel concentration employed. Molecular weights for these components were therefore calculated from the asymptotic region of the plots of molecular weight versus gel concentration."
https://openalex.org/W1562725670,"Abstract The uptake of cyanocobalamin (CN-B12) by cells of Escherichia coli consists of an initial rapid phase of B12 binding to specific receptors on the outer membrane of the cell envelope, which is followed by a slower secondary phase in which the B12 is transferred from these receptors into the interior of the cell. This paper describes some of the properties of the initial phase of uptake in cells of E. coli KBT001, a methionine-B12 auxotroph, and in cells of B12 transport mutants derived from this strain. Cells of strains KBT026 and KBT069 lacked the initial phase of B12 uptake, whereas those of strains KBT041 and KBT103 were defective only in some part of the secondary phase. The kinetic characteristics of the initial phase of uptake were indistinguishable in cells from strains KBT001, KBT041, and KBT103, giving a Km for CN-B12 of about 4 nm. Competitive inhibition of this uptake was given by aquocobalamin, cyanocobinamide, methyl cobalamin, and deoxyadenosyl cobalamin, with Ki values ranging from 0.3 to 4.2 nm. No inhibition was given by cyanocobalamin 5'-phosphate, which was the only corrinoid compound tested which was apparently not recognized by the initial B12-binding sites. Cells from strains KBT001, KBT041, and KBT103 each possessed approximately 200 initial B12-binding sites per cell. These sites were found to be firmly bound to the outer membrane of the cell envelope and were not released by osmotic shock treatment of whole cells, sonication, sucrose density gradient centrifugation of envelope fragments, selective solubilization of the inner membrane by treatment of whole envelopes with Triton X-100-MgCl2, and exposure of cell envelopes to chaotropic agents or enzymes such as lysozyme, trypsin, and phospholipases A, C, and D. Cell envelopes and outer membrane preparations from cells of strains KBT026 and KBT069 had no detectable ability to bind CN-[60Co]B12. The B12-binding activity in the outer membrane was solubilized by extraction with 2% Triton X-100-1 mm EDTA at pH 7.6 with retention of about 50% of its activity. The binding of CN-B12 to whole cells, cell envelopes, outer membrane particles, and solubilized outer membranes was inhibited by 1 mm EDTA and 1 mm ethylene glycol bis(β-aminoethyl ether)-N,N'-tetraacetic acid, but not by 5 mm o-phenanthroline. This inhibition was reversed by a variety of divalent cations, the most effective of which was Ca2+. Osmotic shock treatment of the cells released trace amounts (5 to 10 binding sites per cell) of B12-binding activity, which was separated into two distinct size fractions by chromatography on Sephadex G-100. The larger of these species was found only in cells from strains which possessed an intact initial phase of B12 uptake and is believed to consist of small fragments of the outer membrane containing l5% of the initial B12-binding sites. The small B12-binding species was detectable in all of the strains, but no clear role for it in B12 transport has yet been established. The inner membrane from the E. coli cell envelope was unable to bind free CN-B12, and it was concluded that the presumptive B12 receptor on this membrane must recognize B12 only when the B12 is attached to some specific donor molecule. This would indicate an essential similarity between the B12 uptake systems of the E. coli inner membrane and mammalian plasma membranes. Possible candidates for such a B12 donor are the outer membrane B12 receptor and the smaller B12 binder in the periplasmic space."

https://openalex.org/W1522740477,"SUMMARY The interaction of initiation factor IF-Z with ribosomes during initiation of protein synthesis was studied in vifro with the radioactive factor, [32P]phosphoryl initiation factor IF-Z. The binding and release of the factor were analyzed by sucrose density gradient centrifugation. The results show that: 1. Initiation factor IF-2 is part of the complete 30 S initia- tion complex formed in the presence of A-U-G, N-formyl- methionyl transfer RNA, initiation factor IF-l, and 5’-guano- sine triphosphate or 5’-guanylyl methylenediphosphonate. 2. Initiation factor IF-2 binds to 30 S ribosomes in the absence of the other components of the 30 S initiation com- plex. The binding is stabilized by the addition of 5’-guano- sine triphosphate and by low salt concentrations in the gradi- ents. 3. Initiation factors IF-l and IF-3 greatly enhance the stability of initiation factor IF-2 binding to 30 S ribosomes. It is proposed that a complex of the 30 S ribosome and the three initiation factors may be an intermediate in the forma- tion of the complete 30 S initiation complex. 4. Initiation factor IF-2 binds stoichiometrically to active 30 S ribosomes in the presence of saturating amounts of initiation factors IF-2, IF-l, and IF-3. If the binding reac- tions are treated with glutaraldehyde before gradient analysis, 2 molecules of initiation factor IF-2 are bound per 30 S ribosome. 5. Initiation factor IF-2 and iV-formylmethionyl transfer RNA bind in equal proportions to the 70 S initiation complex formed with 5’-guanylyl methylenediphosphonate. When the 70 S complex is formed with 5’-guanosine triphosphate, however, initiation factor IF-2 no longer is bound to the complex. It is suggested that the role of 5’-guanosine tri- phosphate hydrolysis is to increase the rate of ejection of initiation factor IF-2 from the 70 S initiation complex. Initiation factor IF-2 from"

https://openalex.org/W1570507884,"Abstract In rat thymus cells incubated with carbohydrate substrate the steady state rate of incorporation of uridine into RNA generally parallels the rate of incorporation of amino acids into protein. In both instances glucose is required for continued maximal incorporation rates, a requirement that is only partially satisfied by other readily metabolized substrates such as pyruvate, lactate, or β-hydroxybutyrate. The inhibitory effects of cortisol on the incorporation of uridine into RNA parallel those on the incorporation of amino acids into protein and appear to be largely on the carbohydrate-dependent portion. Substantial differences in relative rates of incorporation of RNA and protein precursors are revealed, however, by a study of the rapid changes that occur after the delayed addition of carbohydrate; an immediate burst in the incorporation of uridine into RNA, maximal at 1 to 2 min, precedes the slower rise in the incorporation of amino acids into protein. Moreover, in cells previously treated for 2 hours with cortisol there emerges from the moment of carbohydrate addition a maximal cortisol inhibition on uridine incorporation, about 40% of the carbohydrate-induced rise, whereas cortisol inhibition of amino acid incorporation emerges gradually after a 10-min lag. Studies with actinomycin and puromycin reveal that, for both the stimulatory effects of carbohydrates and the inhibitory effects of cortisol that emerge after delayed carbohydrate addition, the changes in RNA and protein metabolism are independent of each other since the influences of both carbohydrates and cortisol on the incorporation of precursors into either macromolecular species persist when the synthesis of the other species has been blocked by antibiotic. It is concluded that the late, 2-hour, effects of cortisol on the labeling of both RNA and protein are secondary to early hormonal inhibition of carbohydrate metabolism, possibly mediated through alterations in adenine nucleotide metabolism."

https://openalex.org/W1541079125,"Abstract The subunits, α and β, of human thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) from the pituitary have been obtained by the same procedures utilized for the preparation of bovine TSH subunits, namely, dissociation in 1 m propionic acid and separation by gel filtration. The amino acid composition of human TSH-α indicates that this subunit is identical or nearly so with the α subunits of human luteinizing hormone and human chorionic gonadotropin. The NH2-terminal residue is valine and it appears that human TSH-α is shortened at its amino end by 7 residues relative to bovine TSH-α; a similar relationship has been shown by others for human LH-α relative to the ovine or bovine subunit. The β subunit of human TSH differs markedly in amino acid composition from those of the two human gonadotropins, particularly with respect to tyrosine, isoleucine, valine, proline, arginine, and lysine. The carbohydrate analyses for the 2 subunits are given. A major difference between human and bovine TSH is the presence of sialic acid in the former, nearly all in the α subunit. Immunological comparisons by double diffusion show that antisera to the intact hormone or its α subunit cross-react with homologous TSH and with the human gonadotropins but that the antiserum against the β subunit is specific for thyroid-stimulating hormone. The human subunits were shown, by gel electrophoresis and bioassay, to form intra- and interspecies recombinants with complementary subunits from other glycoprotein hormones."

Magnetic circular dichroism of the Co(II) chromophore in the Co(II)-Cu(II) enzyme is typical of tetrahedral Co(II) compounds. The magnetic circular dichroism band pattern is almost identical with the magnetic circular dichroism of the anion complexes of Co(II) carbonic anhydrase, implying similar coordination geometries in the two enzyme Co(II) complexes. The Cu(II) chromophore is only weakly induced by the magnetic field, with induced ellipticity an order of magnitude less than that of the Co(II) chromophore. Reduction of the Co(II)-Cu(II) protein causes minor, but significant, changes in the Co(II) site as measured by magnetic circular dichroism."

https://openalex.org/W1588343369,"The interactions of specific antibodies with the human retinol-binding protein (RBP) and the thyroxine-binding prealbumin have been investigated. When an antibody combines with either of these proteins, the tryptophyl fluorescence of the antibody is partially quenched. Polarization of fluorescence of RBP-retinol increased rapidly on formation of antibody-RBP complexes. With fluorescence-quenching and polarization measurements as indicators, the stoichiometries and equilibrium constants of the antigen-antibody reactions have been studied. The data show that RBP, whether free or in complex with prealbumin, exhibits identical reactivity with anti-RBP Fab′-fragments. The conclusion is reached that the prealbumin binding site of RBP is not a major antigenic structure. The data indicate that the number of antigenic sites on RBP is limited and is the factor which controls the number of antibodies bound per RBP molecule. By quantum yield measurements of retinol it was found that RBP does not undergo any measureable conformational change on complex formation with Fab′-fragments. Free prealbumin could simultaneously interact with a maximum number of 12 anti-prealbumin Fab′-fragments. This suggests that there are three antigenic sites on each of the four identical prealbumin subunits. RBP, on forming a complex with prealbumin, competed with four anti-prealbumin Fab′-fragments. These Fab′-fragments showed a limited heterogeneity indicating that they may be directed toward a single antigenic site. It is proposed that the competition between RBP and the anti-prealbumin Fab′-fragments may be interpreted as a consequence of a negative cooperativity on RBP forming a complex with prealbumin. The equilibrium constant for Fab′-fragments forming a complex with prealbumin was lowered on thyroxine binding to prealbumin. This result supports the earlier suggestion that thyroxine binding to prealbumin is an example of a negative homotropic interaction."

Enzyme prepared in Helsinki consisted almost entirely of single ring structures. Enzyme prepared in Philadelphia under essentially the same conditions consisted almost entirely of tubular forms in which four rings were stacked together. Repeated freezing and thawing of the Helsinki preparation markedly increased the number of four-ring structures, but it was not possible to establish reproducible conditions for the interconversion of these two major forms of the enzyme. Each ring in the four-ring structure had a diameter of 100 A, a height of 30 to 35 A, and a central hole of about 20 A. The single ring structure was slightly more distended. The molecular weight of each ring was about 200,000, and therefore the molecular weight of the four-ring structure was about 800,000. The inner two rings of the four-ring structure were closer together than the outer two rings. Since the four rings appeared to be identical, the observations suggested that the rings were held together by a combination of heterologous and isologous bonds. No regular structures with more than four rings were seen, and the simplest bonding sequence consistent with these observations was (AB)—(AB)— (BA)—(BA) in which larger structures were not favored, because the formation of the inner B—B bond altered the A surfaces on the inner rings so that they were not equivalent to the A surfaces on the outer rings."

The enthalpy change observed with a nonphosphorylating system involving sonically disrupted mitochondria agreed with the calculated enthalpy change. The enthalpy changes for phosphorylating and uncoupled systems involving intact mitochondria, however, were all more negative than calculated. The discrepancies between observed and calculated values for systems involving intact mitochondria appear to be caused by something other than neutralization of protons and it is suggested that they may be caused by the type of experimental system used. The observed enthalpy changes for gramicidin-uncoupled and oleic acid-uncoupled oxidation of succinate were lower and higher, respectively, than for a dinitrophenol-uncoupled system. The observed enthalpy change for a dicoumarol-uncoupled system, however, was the same as a dinitrophenol-uncoupled system. In all cases, the uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation by use of dinitrophenol, dicoumarol, gramicidin, or oleic acid caused the observed enthalpy change to become more negative. These increases in enthalpy change were equivalent to the enthalpy change for the hydrolysis of ATP to ADP and Pi when dinitrophenol, dicoumarol, or gramicidin were used as uncouplers, but was greater than this when oleic acid was used."
