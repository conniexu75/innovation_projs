https://openalex.org/W2031839214,"In a seminal paper, Garrett Hardin argued in 1968 that users of a commons are caught in an inevitable process that leads to the destruction of the resources on which they depend. This article discusses new insights about such problems and the conditions most likely to favor sustainable uses of common-pool resources. Some of the most difficult challenges concern the management of large-scale resources that depend on international cooperation, such as fresh water in international basins or large marine ecosystems. Institutional diversity may be as important as biological diversity for our long-term survival."

https://openalex.org/W2049197565,"Abstract TLR4 is a member of the recently identified Toll-like receptor family of proteins and has been putatively identified as Lps, the gene necessary for potent responses to lipopolysaccharide in mammals. In order to determine whether TLR4 is involved in lipopolysaccharide-induced activation of the nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) pathway, HEK 293 cells were transiently transfected with human TLR4 cDNA and an NF-κB-dependent luciferase reporter plasmid followed by stimulation with lipopolysaccharide/CD14 complexes. The results demonstrate that lipopolysaccharide stimulates NF-κB-mediated gene expression in cells transfected with the TLR4 gene in a dose- and time-dependent fashion. Furthermore, E5531, a lipopolysaccharide antagonist, blocked TLR4-mediated transgene activation in a dose-dependent manner (IC50∼30 nm). These data demonstrate that TLR4 is involved in lipopolysaccharide signaling and serves as a cell-surface co-receptor for CD14, leading to lipopolysaccharide-mediated NF-κB activation and subsequent cellular events."
https://openalex.org/W1978559408,"The Ca 2+ -activated protein phosphatase calcineurin induces apoptosis, but the mechanism is unknown. Calcineurin was found to dephosphorylate BAD, a pro-apoptotic member of the Bcl-2 family, thus enhancing BAD heterodimerization with Bcl-x L and promoting apoptosis. The Ca 2+ -induced dephosphorylation of BAD correlated with its dissociation from 14-3-3 in the cytosol and translocation to mitochondria where Bcl-x L resides. In hippocampal neurons, l -glutamate, an inducer of Ca 2+ influx and calcineurin activation, triggered mitochondrial targeting of BAD and apoptosis, which were both suppressible by coexpression of a dominant-inhibitory mutant of calcineurin or pharmacological inhibitors of this phosphatase. Thus, a Ca 2+ -inducible mechanism for apoptosis induction operates by regulating BAD phosphorylation and localization in cells."
https://openalex.org/W2053372168,"Phosphorylation of inhibitor of kappa B (IκB) proteins is an important step in the activation of the transcription nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) and requires two IκB kinases, IKK1 (IKKα) and IKK2 (IKKβ). Mice that are devoid of the IKK2 gene had extensive liver damage from apoptosis and died as embryos, but these mice could be rescued by the inactivation of the gene encoding tumor necrosis factor receptor 1. Mouse embryonic fibroblast cells that were isolated from IKK2 –/– embryos showed a marked reduction in tumor necrosis factor–α (TNF-α)– and interleukin-1α–induced NF-κB activity and an enhanced apoptosis in response to TNF-α. IKK1 associated with NF-κB essential modulator (IKKγ/IKKAP1), another component of the IKK complex. These results show that IKK2 is essential for mouse development and cannot be substituted with IKK1."

https://openalex.org/W1661180389,"IκB [inhibitor of nuclear factor κB (NF-κB)] kinase (IKK) phosphorylates IκB inhibitory proteins, causing their degradation and activation of transcription factor NF-κB, a master activator of inflammatory responses. IKK is composed of three subunits—IKKα and IKKβ, which are highly similar protein kinases, and IKKγ, a regulatory subunit. In mammalian cells, phosphorylation of two sites at the activation loop of IKKβ was essential for activation of IKK by tumor necrosis factor and interleukin-1. Elimination of equivalent sites in IKKα, however, did not interfere with IKK activation. Thus, IKKβ, not IKKα, is the target for proinflammatory stimuli. Once activated, IKKβ autophosphorylated at a carboxyl-terminal serine cluster. Such phosphorylation decreased IKK activity and may prevent prolonged activation of the inflammatory response."
https://openalex.org/W1981115336,"The oligomeric IκB kinase (IKK) is composed of three polypeptides: IKKα and IKKβ, the catalytic subunits, and IKKγ, a regulatory subunit. IKKα and IKKβ are similar in structure and thought to have similar function—phosphorylation of the IκB inhibitors in response to proinflammatory stimuli. Such phosphorylation leads to degradation of IκB and activation of nuclear factor κB transcription factors. The physiological function of these protein kinases was explored by analysis of IKKα-deficient mice. IKKα was not required for activation of IKK and degradation of IκB by proinflammatory stimuli. Instead, loss of IKKα interfered with multiple morphogenetic events, including limb and skeletal patterning and proliferation and differentiation of epidermal keratinocytes."
https://openalex.org/W2008596132,"The gene encoding inhibitor of kappa B (IκB) kinase α (IKKα; also called IKK1) was disrupted by gene targeting. IKKα-deficient mice died perinatally. In IKKα-deficient fetuses, limb outgrowth was severely impaired despite unaffected skeletal development. The epidermal cells in IKKα-deficient fetuses were highly proliferative with dysregulated epidermal differentiation. In the basal layer, degradation of IκB and nuclear localization of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) were not observed. Thus, IKKα is essential for NF-κB activation in the limb and skin during embryogenesis. In contrast, there was no impairment of NF-κB activation induced by either interleukin-1 or tumor necrosis factor–α in IKKα-deficient embryonic fibroblasts and thymocytes, indicating that IKKα is not essential for cytokine-induced activation of NF-κB."
https://openalex.org/W2028489075,"Results from a global climate model including an interactive parameterization of stratospheric chemistry show how upper stratospheric ozone changes may amplify observed, 11-year solar cycle irradiance changes to affect climate. In the model, circulation changes initially induced in the stratosphere subsequently penetrate into the troposphere, demonstrating the importance of the dynamical coupling between the stratosphere and troposphere. The model reproduces many observed 11-year oscillations, including the relatively long record of geopotential height variations; hence, it implies that these oscillations are likely driven, at least in part, by solar variability."

The logic gate consists of a cell, composed of four dots connected in a ring by tunnel junctions, and two single-dot electrometers. The device is operated by applying inputs to the gates of the cell. The logic AND and OR operations are verified using the electrometer outputs. Theoretical simulations of the logic gate output characteristics are in excellent agreement with experiment."
https://openalex.org/W1981849389,"Imprinted genes display parent-of-origin-dependent monoallelic expression that apparently regulates complex mammalian traits, including growth and behavior. The Peg3 gene is expressed in embryos and the adult brain from the paternal allele only. A mutation in the Peg3 gene resulted in growth retardation, as well as a striking impairment of maternal behavior that frequently resulted in death of the offspring. This result may be partly due to defective neuronal connectivity, as well as reduced oxytocin neurons in the hypothalamus, because mutant mothers were deficient in milk ejection. This study provides further insights on the evolution of epigenetic regulation of imprinted gene dosage in modulating mammalian growth and behavior."

A metallic split gate serves as a tunable beam splitter to partition the incident beam into transmitted and reflected partial beams. In the nonequilibrium case the fluctuations in the partial beams are shown to be fully anticorrelated, demonstrating that fermions exclude each other. In equilibrium, the cross-correlation of current fluctuations at two different contacts is also found to be negative and nonzero, provided that a direct transmission exists between the contacts."
https://openalex.org/W2013460988,"Axin forms a complex with glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β) and β-catenin and promotes GSK-3β-dependent phosphorylation of β-catenin, thereby stimulating the degradation of β-catenin. Because GSK-3β also phosphorylates Axin in the complex, the physiological significance of the phosphorylation of Axin was examined. Treatment of COS cells with LiCl, a GSK-3β inhibitor, and okadaic acid, a protein phosphatase inhibitor, decreased and increased, respectively, the cellular protein level of Axin. Pulse-chase analyses showed that the phosphorylated form of Axin was more stable than the unphosphorylated form and that an Axin mutant, in which the possible phosphorylation sites for GSK-3β were mutated, exhibited a shorter half-life than wild type Axin. Dvl-1, which was genetically shown to function upstream of GSK-3β, inhibited the phosphorylation of Axin by GSK-3β in vitro. Furthermore, Wnt-3a-containing conditioned medium down-regulated Axin and accumulated β-catenin in L cells and expression of Dvl-1ΔPDZ, in which the PDZ domain was deleted, suppressed this action of Wnt-3a. These results suggest that the phosphorylation of Axin is important for the regulation of its stability and that Wnt down-regulates Axin through Dvl.

Genetic and biochemical analyses have revealed that there are components that are structurally and functionally conserved in the Wnt signaling pathway among flies, frogs, and mammals (1Miller J.R.

The current model for the Wnt signaling pathway proposes that in the absence of Wnt, GSK-3β phosphorylates β-catenin, resulting in the degradation of β-catenin. In response to Wnt, Dvl antagonizes GSK-3β activity through an as yet unknown mechanism. This leads to the stabilization and the accumulation of β-catenin. The accumulated β-catenin translocates to the nucleus, associates with the transcriptional enhancers of the Lef/Tcf family (4Yost C. Torres M. Miller J.R. Huang E. Kimelman D. Moon R.T.

Thus, Axin is a negative regulator of the Wnt signaling pathway and inhibits axis formation. We have identified rat Axin (rAxin) and its homolog, Axil (forAxin-like), as GSK-3β-interacting proteins (11Ikeda S. Kishida S. Yamamoto H. Murai H. Koyama S. Kikuchi A.

Wirtz R. Kühl M. Wedlich D. Birchmeier W. Science. 1998; 280: 596-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (1095) Google Scholar) and is identical to Axil. We have found that both Axin and Axil bind not only to GSK-3β but also to β-catenin and that they promote GSK-3β-dependent phosphorylation of β-catenin (11Ikeda S. Kishida S. Yamamoto H. Murai H. Koyama S. Kikuchi A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1371-1384Crossref PubMed Scopus (1087) Google Scholar, 12Yamamoto H. Kishida S. Uochi T. Ikeda S. Koyama S. Asashima M. Kikuchi A. Mol. Cell.

We have also shown that the regulators of G protein signaling (RGS) domain of rAxin directly interacts with APC and that expression of rAxin in COS and SW480 cells stimulates the degradation of β-catenin (14Kishida S.

Axin enhances GSK-3β-dependent phosphorylation of APC in addition to β-catenin in vitro (17Hart M.J. de los Santos R. Albert I.N. Rubinfeld B. Polakis P. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 573-581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the phosphorylation of APC increases its binding to β-catenin (20Rubinfeld B. Albert I. Porfiri E. Fiol C. Munemitsu S. Polakis P. Science. 1996; 272: 1023-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (1275) Google Scholar). Although Axin is also phosphorylated by GSK-3β directly, the phosphorylation of Axin does not affect its binding to GSK-3β and β-catenin in vitro (11Ikeda S. Kishida S. Yamamoto H. Murai H. Koyama S. Kikuchi A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1371-1384Crossref PubMed Scopus (1087) Google Scholar). These results indicate that β-catenin, APC, and Axin form a complex with GSK-3β and that the phosphorylation occurs efficiently in the complex. However, the physiological significance of the phosphorylation of Axin is not known. Therefore, we examined a role of the phosphorylation of Axin in the Wnt signaling pathway. Here we demonstrate that the phosphorylation of Axin by GSK-3β regulates its stability, that Dvl inhibits the GSK-3β-dependent phosphorylation of Axin, and that Wnt-3a down-regulates Axin through Dvl.

Confluent wild type L cells or L cells expressing HA-Dvl-1ΔPDZ (35-mm-diameter dish) were washed with Dulbecco's modified essential medium twice, and the indicated volume of Wnt-3a-conditioned medium, which was adjusted to a total volume of 700 μl with Dulbecco's modified essential medium, was added to the cells. After stimulation for 6 h, the cells were lysed in 100 μl of lysis buffer (11Ikeda S. Kishida S. Yamamoto H. Murai H. Koyama S. Kikuchi A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1371-1384Crossref PubMed Scopus (1087) Google Scholar), and the lysates (20 μg of protein) were probed with the anti-Axin and anti-β-catenin antibodies. rAxin was phosphorylated by GSK-3β directly in vitro, andSANDSEQQS330 of rAxin was one of the phosphorylation sites for GSK-3β (11Ikeda S. Kishida S. Yamamoto H. Murai H. Koyama S. Kikuchi A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1371-1384Crossref PubMed Scopus (1087) Google Scholar). First we examined whether rAxin is phosphorylated by GSK-3β in intact cells. Myc-rAxin was phosphorylated when COS cells were metabolically labeled with 32Pi (Fig.1 A). We tried to express Myc-rAxin322/326/330A, in which Ser322, Ser326, and Ser330 were mutated to Ala, in COS cells, but its protein level was lower than that of Myc-rAxin (wild type) (Fig. 1 A, lanes 3 and 4). Consistent with the protein level, the phosphorylation and apparent molecular weight of MycrAxin322/326/330A were reduced in comparison with Myc-rAxin (Fig. 1 A, lanes 1 and 2). Therefore, we used LiCl, which is known to be an inhibitor of GSK-3β (26Klein P.S. Melton D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8455-8459Crossref PubMed Scopus (2056) Google Scholar, 27Stambolic V. Ruel L. Woodgett J.R. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1664-1668Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It appeared that treatment of COS cells with LiCl decreased the phosphorylation of Myc-rAxin, whereas okadaic acid, a protein phosphatase 1 or 2A inhibitor, increased it (Fig. 1 A, lanes 5–7). However, these changes by LiCl and okadaic acid were also correlated with the protein level of Myc-rAxin (Fig. 1 A, lanes 8–10). LiCl decreased the protein level of Myc-rAxin in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1 B). Consistent with the previous observations (28Orford K. Crockett C. Jensen J.P. Weissman A.M. Byers S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24735-24738Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar), treatment of COS cells with LiCl resulted in the cytoplasmic accumulation of β-catenin (Fig. 1 B). Okadaic acid prevented the decrease of Myc-rAxin by LiCl (Fig. 1 B). LiCl did not affect the protein level of transfected Myc-RalBP1, an effector protein of small GTP-binding protein Ral (29Feig L.A. Urano T. Cantor S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 438-441Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar) or endogenous GSK-3β (Fig. 1 C). Therefore, the effect of LiCl that reduces rAxin is not nonspecific. These results suggest that the phosphorylation of rAxin is correlated with its stability. To investigate the stability of Axin by phosphorylation further, pulse-chase analysis was performed. Pulse-labeled Myc-rAxin in COS cells migrated slowly on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in a time-dependent manner (Fig.2 A), suggesting that Myc-rAxin was phosphorylated. Pulse-labeled Myc-rAxin did not exhibit a gel band shift and disappeared at 12 h in COS cells treated with LiCl (Fig.2 A). In contrast, okadaic acid enhanced the band shift and prevented the decay of pulse-labeled Myc-rAxin at 12 h (Fig.2 A). Pulse-labeled Myc-rAxin decreased gradually with a half-life of approximately 8 h, and pulse-labeled Myc-rAxin322/326/330A exhibited a shorter half-life (Fig.2 B). These results indicate that Axin is phosphorylated by GSK-3β in intact cells and that the phosphorylated form is more stable than the unphosphorylated form. Drosophila Dsh encodes a cytoplasmic protein of unknown biochemical function in the Wg signaling pathway (1Miller J.R. Moon R.T. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2527-2539Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar, 2Cadigan K.M. Nusse R. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3286-3305Crossref PubMed Scopus (2206) Google Scholar, 3Dale T.C. Biochem. J. 1998; 329: 209-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). In mammals, dvl-1, -2, and -3genes have been isolated as homologs of Dsh (21Pizzuti A. Amati F. Calabrese G. Mari A. Colosimo A. Silani V. Giardino L. Ratti A. Penso D.L.C. Palka G. Scarlato G. Novelli G. Dallapiccola B. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1996; 5: 953-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 30Sussman D.J. Klingensmith J.

Dev. 1996; 58: 15-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). It has been shown that Dsh antagonizes shaggy, a fly homolog of GSK-3β, in the Wg signaling pathway (2Cadigan K.M. Nusse R. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3286-3305Crossref PubMed Scopus (2206) Google Scholar, 3Dale T.C. Biochem. J. 1998; 329: 209-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar), and that overexpression of Dvl-1 in Chinese hamster ovary cells inhibits GSK-3 activity as measured by the GSK-3-mediated phosphorylation of tau proteins (32Wagner U. Brownless J. Irving N.G. Lucas F.R. Salinas P.C. Miller C.C.J. FEBS Lett. 1997; 411: 369-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). However, little is known about the biochemical pathway leading from Dvl to GSK-3β. Therefore, we examined whether Dvl-1 affects the phosphorylation of rAxin by GSK-3β in vitro. MBP-Dvl-1 itself was not phosphorylated by GST-GSK-3β (data not shown). GST-GSK-3β phosphorylated MBP-rAxin in a time-dependent manner (11Ikeda S. Kishida S. Yamamoto H. Murai H. Koyama S. Kikuchi A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1371-1384Crossref PubMed Scopus (1087) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3 A). MBP-Dvl-1 inhibited this phosphorylation of MBP-rAxin (Fig. 3 A). This inhibitory activity of MBP-Dvl-1 was dose-dependent, and MBP alone did not inhibit the GST-GSK-3β-dependent phosphorylation of MBP-rAxin (Fig. 3 B). Dvl has the PDZ domain, and disruption of the PDZ domain abolishes its activity in the Wg-Armadillo pathway and in the Xenopus axis induction assay (33Sokol S.Y. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1456-1467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar, 34Yanagawa S. van Leeuwen F. Wodarz A. Klingensmith J. Nusse R. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1087-1097Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). Deletion of the PDZ domain from Dvl-1 (MBP-Dvl-1ΔPDZ) greatly reduced its activity to inhibit the phosphorylation of MBP-rAxin by GST-GSK-3β (Fig. 3 B). Inhibition of the phosphorylation of MBP-rAxin by MBP-Dvl-1 was not recovered even though the amounts of MBP-rAxin increased (Fig. 3 C). Lineweaver-Burk plots indicated that the K m andV max values of MBP-rAxin for GST-GSK-3β in the absence of MBP-Dvl-1 were 131 nm and 4.3 nmol/min/mg, respectively, and that those in the presence of MBP-Dvl-1 were 129 nm and 2.5 nmol/min/mg (Fig. 3 C). These results suggest that Dvl-1 inhibits the GSK-3β-dependent phosphorylation of Axin in a noncompetitive manner. This is the first demonstration showing that Dvl inhibits the function of GSK-3β directly. However, it is not likely that Dvl-1 inhibits GSK-3β activity itself, because MBP-Dvl-1 did not affect the phosphorylation of synthetic peptide substrate, which is designed from glycogen synthase, by GST-GSK-3β (data not shown). We have recently found that Dvl-1 directly binds to Axin and that the binding of Dvl-1 to Axin does not affect the interaction of GSK-3β with Axin. 2Kishida, S., Yamamoto, H., Hino, S., Ikeda, S., Kishida, M., and Kikuchi, A. (1999) Mol. Cell. Biol., in press. It is possible that the binding of Dvl to Axin induces the structural change of the Axin complex; therefore GSK-3β does not effectively phosphorylate Axin. However, higher concentrations (μm order) of Dvl-1 are required to inhibit the GSK-3β-dependent phosphorylation of Axin in our in vitro experiments. Therefore, modification of Dvl such as phosphorylation could be necessary to act on the Axin complex in intact cells. These results suggest that Dvl may regulate the stability of Axin. Finally we examined whether Wnt signal regulates the stability of endogenous Axin in intact cells. Although Wnt proteins are secretory, they predominantly bind to the cell surface or extracellular matrix. Small amounts of biologically active Wnt-1 or Wg can be found in culture medium conditioned by cells expressing these proteins (35van Leeuwen F. Samos C.H. Nusse R. Nature. 1994; 368: 342-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 36Bradley R.S. Brown A.M.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4616-4622Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The Wg-conditioned medium from Schneider cells increases the level of Armadillo inDrosophila disc cells and inactivates GSK-3 in 10T1/2 fibroblasts (35van Leeuwen F. Samos C.H. Nusse R. Nature. 1994; 368: 342-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 37Cook D. Fry M.J. Hughes K. Sumathipala R. Woodgett J.R. Dale T.C. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4526-4536Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). Based on assays carried out with mammalian cell lines and Xenopus embryos, the Wnt proteins can be classified into two groups, Wnt-1 and Wnt-5a classes (38Wong G.T. Gavin B.J. McMahon A.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6278-6286Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar, 39Du S.J. Purcell S.M. Christian J.L. McGrew L.L. Moon R.T. Mol. Cell.

The Wnt-1 class includes Wnt-1, Wnt-2, Wnt-3, Wnt-3a, and Wnt-8, which have activities to transform the cells and to accumulate cytoplasmic β-catenin, whereas the Wnt-5a class includes Wnt-4, Wnt-5a, Wnt-5b, Wnt-7b, and Wnt-11, which do not exhibit the transformation and β-catenin accumulation activities. Because Wnt-3a displays characteristics similar to those of Wnt-1, we prepared Wnt-3a-containing conditioned medium. In these experiments we used mouse fibroblast L cells, because the changes in the expression level of β-catenin by Wnt are easily observed due to little expression of cadherin in the cells (15Kishida M. Koyama S. Kishida S. Matsubara K. Nakashima S. Higano K. Takada R. Takada S. Kikuchi A. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 979-985Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 23Shibamoto S. Higano K. Takada R.

Nature. 1987; 329: 341-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Western blot analyses with the anti-Axin antibody demonstrated that Axin is most abundant in L cells among various cell lines including SW480, NIH3T3, COS, and Chinese hamster ovary cells (data not shown). Wnt-3a conditioned medium induced the accumulation of β-catenin in L cells in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.4 A). In contrast, Wnt-3a decreased Axin (Fig. 4 A). Control conditioned medium did not affect the amounts of Axin and β-catenin (data not shown). To examine whether Dvl is involved in this action of Wnt-3a, we established L cells, which express HA-Dvl-1ΔPDZ stably. Wnt-3a-induced increase of β-catenin and decrease of Axin were suppressed in L cells expressing HA-Dvl-1ΔPDZ (Fig. 4 B). These results indicate that Wnt not only accumulates β-catenin but also down-regulates Axin through Dvl. We have recently found that in COS cells Axin interacts with GSK-3β, β-catenin, and APC in a high molecular mass complex with a molecular mass of more than 103 kDa on gel filtration column chromatography (15Kishida M. Koyama S. Kishida S. Matsubara K. Nakashima S. Higano K. Takada R. Takada S. Kikuchi A. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 979-985Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). In L cells β-catenin is present in the high molecular mass complex in the absence of Wnt-3a, whereas addition of Wnt-3a to L cells increases β-catenin in a low molecular mass complex with a molecular mass of 200–300 kDa (15Kishida M. Koyama S. Kishida S. Matsubara K. Nakashima S. Higano K. Takada R. Takada S. Kikuchi A. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 979-985Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). In L cells expressing Axin, Wnt-3a-induced increase of β-catenin in the low molecular mass complex is not observed (15Kishida M. Koyama S. Kishida S. Matsubara K. Nakashima S. Higano K. Takada R. Takada S. Kikuchi A. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 979-985Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). These results suggest that a balance between the high and low molecular mass complexes containing β-catenin is closely regulated and that Axin plays a role in limiting the accumulation of β-catenin in the low molecular mass complex. Wnt may regulate the assembly of the complex consisting of Axin, APC, β-catenin, and GSK-3β and induce the dissociation of β-catenin from the complex. It is possible that β-catenin free from the complex is accumulated, binds to different partners such as Lef/Tcf, and transmits the signals. Our results suggest that the Wnt signal could act on the Axin complex through Dvl, resulting in the inhibition of the GSK-3β-dependent phosphorylation of Axin and the degradation of Axin. Degradation of Axin due to hypophosphorylation may induce the dissociation of β-catenin from the complex by decreasing the binding of β-catenin to Axin. Studies to clarify the mechanism of proteolysis of Axin are under way. We are grateful to Drs. B. Dallapiccola, G. Novelli, and C. Turck for reagents.

A quantum point contact was used to inject single-mode electrons into a mesoscopic electron beam splitter device. The beam splitter output currents showed negative cross-covariance, indicating that the electrons arrived individually at the beam splitter and were randomly partitioned into two output channels. As the relative time delay between the outputs was changed, the observed ringing in the cross-covariance was consistent with the bandwidths used to monitor the fluctuations. The result demonstrates a fermion complement to the Hanbury Brown and Twiss experiment for photons."

Self-similarity also leads to a species-abundance distribution, which deviates considerably from the commonly assumed lognormal distribution and predicts considerably more rare species than the latter. Because the abundance distribution is derived under the condition of self-similarity, it may be widely applicable beyond ecology."

Whole-cell recording from cultured mouse cortical neurons revealed a NMDA-evoked outward current, I NMDA-K , carried by K + efflux at membrane potentials positive to –86 millivolts. Cortical neurons exposed to NMDA in medium containing reduced Na + and Ca 2+ (as found in ischemic brain tissue) lost substantial intracellular K + and underwent apoptosis. Both K + loss and apoptosis were attenuated by increasing extracellular K + , even when voltage-gated Ca 2+ channels were blocked. Thus NMDA receptor–mediated K + efflux may contribute to neuronal apoptosis after brain ischemia."

In contrast to TFE, the conformational transition of the 1–500 fragment induced by TMAO is cooperative, a condition characteristic of proteins with unique structures. An increasing number of biologically important proteins and protein domains have been found to be only partially structured or unstructured (unfolded) under physiological conditions (1Weinreb P.H. Zhen W. Poon A.W. Conway K.A. Lansbury P.T. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13709-13715Crossref PubMed Scopus (1297) Google Scholar). Notably, many of the nuclear transcription factors show disordered transactivation domains in aqueous solution (2Hahn S. Cell. 1993; 72: 481-483Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). It is generally accepted that the structural uniqueness of proteins determines their biological function. Hence, the identification of unstructured proteins raises the question: what is the structural basis of the functional activity of such proteins/domains? Whether they act being in unfolded state (“natively unfolded” proteins) or adopt structure upon specific interaction with target molecules is a crucial question. The induced-fit and acidic blob models of the function for such transcription factor proteins represent two opposite points of view (3Frankel A.D. Kim P.S. Cell. 1991; 65: 717-719Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Hence, methods that allow studies of the propensity of proteins to fold naturally are valuable.Alcohols (trifluoroethanol, chloroethanol) have long been used to probe the propensity of unstructured protein/domain to form secondary structure (4Dahlman-Wright K. Baumann H. McEwan I.J. Almlof T. Wright A.P.H. Gustafsson J.-A. Hard T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1699-1703Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 5Schmitz M.L. Silva M.A.S.

Chem. 1992; 267: 1411-1414Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Their use has in part been based on the assumption that alcohols might mimic the in vivo conditions under which the disordered domain interacts with a target molecule. It has long been known, however, that alcohols favor the α-helical conformation in peptides or proteins regardless of the type of the secondary structure the proteins/peptides form in the biologically relevant (native) conformation (7Buck M. Schwalbe H. Dobson C.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13219-13232Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 8Fan P. Bracken C. Baum J.

Hence, until interacting partners of unstructured domains are identified, the current biophysical approaches using such alcohols to drive α-helix formation present serious difficulties in interpreting results in the context of biology.Recently we demonstrated the extraordinary ability of a naturally occurring solute, trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO), 1The abbreviations used are: TMAO, trimethylamineN-oxide; TFE, trifluoroethanol; hGR, human glucocorticoid receptor; DBD, DNA-binding domain; GR 1–500, recombinant hGR fragment containing residues 1–500; AF1, recombinant hGR transactivation domain 1 containing residues 77–262; AAD, acidic transactivation domain.1The abbreviations used are: TMAO, trimethylamineN-oxide; TFE, trifluoroethanol; hGR, human glucocorticoid receptor; DBD, DNA-binding domain; GR 1–500, recombinant hGR fragment containing residues 1–500; AF1, recombinant hGR transactivation domain 1 containing residues 77–262; AAD, acidic transactivation domain. to force thermodynamically unstable proteins to fold (10Baskakov I.V. Bolen D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4831-4834Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). Based on the two examples studied, we have shown that TMAO can increase the population of native state relative to denatured state by several orders of magnitude. These proteins regained high functional activity in the presence of TMAO. The present work addresses the question of whether TMAO can induce an unstructured region of transcription factor for which ordered conformation has never been identified to adopt a unique structure.We studied large fragments of recombinant human glucocorticoid receptor (hGR, Fig. 1), the protein that mediates the action of glucocorticoids, hormones essential for human life. The hGR is a required intermediate in the physiological and many of pharmacological actions of the glucocorticoids, compounds often used for the treatment of lymphomas and leukemias and to inhibit the immune response. The hGR has a complex modular structure consisting of several domains: steroid-binding, DNA-binding, and two activation function domains (AF1 and AF2), which are acidic regions responsible for GR's post-DNA-binding transactivation potential (11Beato M. Cell. 1989; 56: 335-344Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2841) Google Scholar). The DNA-binding domains have defined secondary and tertiary structure (12Hard T. Kellenbach E. Boelens R.

Renaud J.-P. Vivat V. Chambon P. Moras D. Gronemeyer H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1993; 3: 87-95Crossref Scopus (674) Google Scholar). The isolated AF1 has been found to be unstructured in aqueous solution (4Dahlman-Wright K. Baumann H. McEwan I.J. Almlof T. Wright A.P.H. Gustafsson J.-A. Hard T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Here, we show that TMAO cooperatively induces structure in the hGR 1–500 fragment (GR 1–500) and that the TMAO-induced structure is different from the α-helix-rich conformation driven by TFE.

The recombinant expression plasmid pGEX-4T/AF1 was selected and transformed intoEschericha coli BL21. The bacteria containing the recombinant vector for GST-AF1 were induced with isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (0.5 mm) for 3 h, lysed, and extracted. Insect cell cytosol containing the expressed protein (GST-GR 1–500) or bacterial extracts containing (GST-AF1) were loaded onto a glutathione-Sepharose column at 4 °C. After thorough washing of column, the GST-GR 1–500 or GST-AF1 bound to the resin was incubated with alkaline phosphatase for 30 min at room temperature to dephosphorylate the peptide. The hGR fragments were then cleaved from GST by digesting with thrombin at 4 °C for 4 h, collected, and concentrated using Amicon Centriprep units. Protein purity was analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis stained with Coomassie Blue R-250 and estimated to be greater than 90%.Fluorescence spectra of GR 1–500 in solution (30 μg/ml, 10 mm Tris, 10 mm NaCl, 10 mmdithiothreitol, pH 7.9) were monitored using a Spex Fluoro Max spectrofluorimeter (excitation 278 or 295 nm). All measurements were made using 1-cm rectangular cuvettes thermostatted at 22 °C, and all data were corrected for the contribution of the respective solute concentrations.CD spectra were recorded using a Olis RSM CD Spectrometer at variable scan rate (always slower than 60 nm/min) in 0.1-cm cuvettes thermostatted at 22 °C in 10 mm Tris, 10 mmNaCl buffer, pH 7.9. The bandwidth was 1 nm with data spacing 0.5 nm, and each spectrum shown is the result of 10–20 spectra accumulated, averaged and smoothed. All spectra were corrected for the contributions of the respective buffers.DISCUSSIONOur fluorescence and CD data support the earlier observation that the transactivation domain AF1 of the hGR is largely unstructured (4Dahlman-Wright K. Baumann H. McEwan I.J. Almlof T. Wright A.P.H. Gustafsson J.-A. Hard T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1699-1703Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Because the hGR with AF1 deleted has only 25–30% transactivation activity of the holo-hGR, the AF1 region is clearly important for determination of the level of transcription of genes that are under glucocorticoid regulation (20Almlof T. Wright A.P.H. Gustafsson J.-A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17535-17540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The AF1 of the hGR is a member of a large family of activation domains (AAD) defined by their richness in acidic residues and little sequence similarity (2Hahn S. Cell. 1993; 72: 481-483Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Since many such domains are rich in acidic amino acids, previous work led to the idea that acidic residues are crucial for the function of AADs (21Mitchell P.J. Tjian R.

Nature. 1988; 333: 210-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar), AADs do not adopt a defined structure in vivo, rather it functions by general ionic interactions with target proteins. However, mutagenesis studies of hGR AF1 demonstrate that acidity is not the most important determinant of activity, and negative charges per se are not sufficient for activation (20Almlof T.

Biol. 1997; 17: 934-945Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). That the hGR AF1 might be structured in vivo is suggested by the pattern of AF1 degradation in cell-free extracts, which show defined degradation products that are inconsistent with the indiscriminate proteolysis expected for an unfolded peptide (20Almlof T. Wright A.P.H. Gustafsson J.-A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17535-17540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Structural studies have shown that AADs have the propensity to form α-helical structure in the presence of alcohols, and several proline substitution mutants reduce both helix-forming potential and transactivation activity (4Dahlman-Wright K. Baumann H. McEwan I.J. Almlof T. Wright A.P.H. Gustafsson J.-A. Hard T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1699-1703Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 5Schmitz M.L. Silva M.A.S.

Chem. 1992; 267: 1411-1414Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Keeping in mind the ability of AADs to form α-helix in the presence of alcohols, one could hypothesize that acidic activation domains are unstructured in vivo until they adopt a more ordered conformation when directly involved in transcriptional activation, according to the induced-fit model of folding (3Frankel A.D. Kim P.S. Cell. 1991; 65: 717-719Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar).The major concern over using alcohols (TFE, chloroethanol) to probe secondary structures of peptides and proteins is the question of the relevance of alcohol-induced structure to the biologically important conformations of the proteins. These alcohols are such potent inducers of α-helices that helices are forced to occur in peptides/proteins, whereas such structures may be unlikely to exist in vivo(7Buck M. Schwalbe H. Dobson C.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13219-13232Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 8Fan P. Bracken C. Baum J. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 1573-1582Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 9Sönnichsen F.D. Van Eyk J.E. Hodges R.S. Sykes B.D. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 8790-8798Crossref PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar). As an example, the work of Hoy et al. (25Hoy M.V. Leuther K.K. Kodadek T. Johnston S.A. Cell. 1993; 72: 587-594Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) with AADs from yeast GAL4 and GCN4 transcription factors demonstrated the ability of AADs to adopt a β-sheet conformation under slightly acidic pH condition, a conformation that is biologically important for interaction with target molecules (26Leuther K.K. Salmeron J.M. Johnston S.A. Cell. 1993; 72: 575-585Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). TFE, on the other hand, induces only α-helical conformation in AADs of GAL4 and GCN4 (25Hoy M.V. Leuther K.K. Kodadek T. Johnston S.A. Cell. 1993; 72: 587-594Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). This result emphasizes the importance of the question about the applicability of TFE in probing biologically relevant structures and illustrates the intrinsic plasticity of the transactivation region,i.e. the ability to adopt different conformations depending upon solution conditions.Our work shows that: 1) the naturally occurring solute TMAO induces compact structure in the GR 1–500 as indicated by the substantial enhancement in intrinsic fluorescence and blue shift of fluorescent maxima; 2) according to the CD data this structure is different from the α-helix-rich conformation driven by TFE; and 3) TMAO causes the conformational transition to occur as a cooperative event, a process characteristic of proteins with unique structures. Because osmolyte-driven stabilization is a natural process (27Yancey P.H. Clark M.E. Hand S.C. Bowlus R.D. Somero G.N. Science. 1982; 217: 1214-1222Crossref PubMed Scopus (2973) Google Scholar), it is likely that TMAO-induced protein folding can provide a reasonable means of evaluating biologically relevant structures of proteins like hGR.It has long been known that TFE increases the propensity of amino acids to form an α-helix, presumably by strengthening the peptide hydrogen bond in TFE/H2O mixtures and through favorable interactions of hydrophobic amino acid side chains with TFE (19Luo P. Baldwin R.L. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 8413-8421Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar, 28Cammers-Goodwin A. Allen T.J. Oslick S.L. McClure K.F. Lee J.H. Kemp D.S. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 3082-3090Crossref Scopus (241) Google Scholar). The peptide hydrogen bonds in the helix are believed to be stabilized indirectly by weakening the hydrogen bonding of water molecules to the peptide backbone in the coil form (28Cammers-Goodwin A. Allen T.J. Oslick S.L. McClure K.F. Lee J.H. Kemp D.S. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 3082-3090Crossref Scopus (241) Google Scholar). As a result of weakening the hydrophobic interactions within the protein interior, TFE denatures native proteins and promotes helical structure in most peptides and proteins, even though this is nonnative helical structure (7Buck M. Schwalbe H. Dobson C.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13219-13232Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 8Fan P. Bracken C. Baum J. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 1573-1582Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 9Sönnichsen F.D. Van Eyk J.E. Hodges R.S. Sykes B.D. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 8790-8798Crossref PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar, 29Luo P. Baldwin R.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 279: 49-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). In contrast, TMAO increases the driving forces for protein folding. We recently found that osmolytes use a new molecular force for protein folding originating from the unfavorable interaction of the TMAO with the peptide backbone (30Wang A. Bolen D.W. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 9101-9108Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). Due to its solvophobic effect on the backbone, TMAO forces thermodynamically unstable proteins to fold without altering the rules for folding to a native-like conformation (10Baskakov I.V. Bolen D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4831-4834Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar).The action of both solutes, TMAO and TFE, focus on the peptide backbone, and this ensures that the effect of both solutes are general in scope, because the backbone is the most prevalent structural element of the protein fabric. In opposition to TFE solution, the propensities of hydrophobic groups to interact with solvent are essentially the same in water as they are in TMAO solution (30Wang A. Bolen D.W. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 9101-9108Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). Thus, due to weakening the hydrophobic interactions the dominant effect of TFE on protein is denaturation with preferential formation of α-helices as a result of strengthening peptide hydrogen bonds, whereas TMAO forces unfolded proteins to fold by providing an additional force for folding that has no preference for any particular secondary structure. Based on the molecular origin of TMAO-driven protein folding, if biologically relevant structure can be induced into the transactivation region of hGR (or any other intrinsically unstructured AAD) without its target molecule, it is more likely to be induced by solutes (like TMAO) that have been selected in nature for their ability to fold and stabilize proteins than it is by alcohols. An increasing number of biologically important proteins and protein domains have been found to be only partially structured or unstructured (unfolded) under physiological conditions (1Weinreb P.H. Zhen W. Poon A.W. Conway K.A. Lansbury P.T. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13709-13715Crossref PubMed Scopus (1297) Google Scholar). Notably, many of the nuclear transcription factors show disordered transactivation domains in aqueous solution (2Hahn S. Cell. 1993; 72: 481-483Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). It is generally accepted that the structural uniqueness of proteins determines their biological function. Hence, the identification of unstructured proteins raises the question: what is the structural basis of the functional activity of such proteins/domains? Whether they act being in unfolded state (“natively unfolded” proteins) or adopt structure upon specific interaction with target molecules is a crucial question. The induced-fit and acidic blob models of the function for such transcription factor proteins represent two opposite points of view (3Frankel A.D. Kim P.S. Cell. 1991; 65: 717-719Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Hence, methods that allow studies of the propensity of proteins to fold naturally are valuable. Alcohols (trifluoroethanol, chloroethanol) have long been used to probe the propensity of unstructured protein/domain to form secondary structure (4Dahlman-Wright K. Baumann H. McEwan I.J. Almlof T. Wright A.P.H. Gustafsson J.-A. Hard T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1699-1703Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 5Schmitz M.L. Silva M.A.S. Altmann H. Czisch M. Holak T.A. Baeuerle P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25613-25620Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Donaldson L. Capone J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1411-1414Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Their use has in part been based on the assumption that alcohols might mimic the in vivo conditions under which the disordered domain interacts with a target molecule. It has long been known, however, that alcohols favor the α-helical conformation in peptides or proteins regardless of the type of the secondary structure the proteins/peptides form in the biologically relevant (native) conformation (7Buck M. Schwalbe H. Dobson C.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13219-13232Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 8Fan P. Bracken C. Baum J. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 1573-1582Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 9Sönnichsen F.D. Van Eyk J.E. Hodges R.S. Sykes B.D. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 8790-8798Crossref PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar). Hence, until interacting partners of unstructured domains are identified, the current biophysical approaches using such alcohols to drive α-helix formation present serious difficulties in interpreting results in the context of biology. Recently we demonstrated the extraordinary ability of a naturally occurring solute, trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO), 1The abbreviations used are: TMAO, trimethylamineN-oxide; TFE, trifluoroethanol; hGR, human glucocorticoid receptor; DBD, DNA-binding domain; GR 1–500, recombinant hGR fragment containing residues 1–500; AF1, recombinant hGR transactivation domain 1 containing residues 77–262; AAD, acidic transactivation domain.1The abbreviations used are: TMAO, trimethylamineN-oxide; TFE, trifluoroethanol; hGR, human glucocorticoid receptor; DBD, DNA-binding domain; GR 1–500, recombinant hGR fragment containing residues 1–500; AF1, recombinant hGR transactivation domain 1 containing residues 77–262; AAD, acidic transactivation domain. to force thermodynamically unstable proteins to fold (10Baskakov I.V. Bolen D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4831-4834Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). Based on the two examples studied, we have shown that TMAO can increase the population of native state relative to denatured state by several orders of magnitude. These proteins regained high functional activity in the presence of TMAO. The present work addresses the question of whether TMAO can induce an unstructured region of transcription factor for which ordered conformation has never been identified to adopt a unique structure. We studied large fragments of recombinant human glucocorticoid receptor (hGR, Fig. 1), the protein that mediates the action of glucocorticoids, hormones essential for human life. The hGR is a required intermediate in the physiological and many of pharmacological actions of the glucocorticoids, compounds often used for the treatment of lymphomas and leukemias and to inhibit the immune response. The hGR has a complex modular structure consisting of several domains: steroid-binding, DNA-binding, and two activation function domains (AF1 and AF2), which are acidic regions responsible for GR's post-DNA-binding transactivation potential (11Beato M. Cell. 1989; 56: 335-344Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2841) Google Scholar). The DNA-binding domains have defined secondary and tertiary structure (12Hard T. Kellenbach E. Boelens R.

Otwinowski Z. Freedman L.P. Yamamoto K.R. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1991; 352: 497-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (1217) Google Scholar), and by analogy with those of other steroid receptors, so does the steroid-binding domain (14Wurtz J.-M. Borguet W. Renaud J.-P. Vivat V. Chambon P. Moras D. Gronemeyer H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1993; 3: 87-95Crossref Scopus (674) Google Scholar). The isolated AF1 has been found to be unstructured in aqueous solution (4Dahlman-Wright K. Baumann H. McEwan I.J. Almlof T. Wright A.P.H. Gustafsson J.-A. Hard T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1699-1703Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Here, we show that TMAO cooperatively induces structure in the hGR 1–500 fragment (GR 1–500) and that the TMAO-induced structure is different from the α-helix-rich conformation driven by TFE. In the smaller AF1 fragment (residues 77–262) both TMAO and TFE induced similar structures. EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESSolutions of TMAO (Sigma) were prepared as described by Baskakov and Bolen (15Baskakov I.V. Bolen D.W. Biophys.

Cell. 1993; 72: 587-594Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) with AADs from yeast GAL4 and GCN4 transcription factors demonstrated the ability of AADs to adopt a β-sheet conformation under slightly acidic pH condition, a conformation that is biologically important for interaction with target molecules (26Leuther K.K. Salmeron J.M. Johnston S.A. Cell. 1993; 72: 575-585Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). TFE, on the other hand, induces only α-helical conformation in AADs of GAL4 and GCN4 (25Hoy M.V. Leuther K.K. Kodadek T. Johnston S.A. Cell. 1993; 72: 587-594Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). This result emphasizes the importance of the question about the applicability of TFE in probing biologically relevant structures and illustrates the intrinsic plasticity of the transactivation region,i.e. the ability to adopt different conformations depending upon solution conditions.Our work shows that: 1) the naturally occurring solute TMAO induces compact structure in the GR 1–500 as indicated by the substantial enhancement in intrinsic fluorescence and blue shift of fluorescent maxima; 2) according to the CD data this structure is different from the α-helix-rich conformation driven by TFE; and 3) TMAO causes the conformational transition to occur as a cooperative event, a process characteristic of proteins with unique structures. Because osmolyte-driven stabilization is a natural process (27Yancey P.H. Clark M.E. Hand S.C. Bowlus R.D. Somero G.N. Science. 1982; 217: 1214-1222Crossref PubMed Scopus (2973) Google Scholar), it is likely that TMAO-induced protein folding can provide a reasonable means of evaluating biologically relevant structures of proteins like hGR.It has long been known that TFE increases the propensity of amino acids to form an α-helix, presumably by strengthening the peptide hydrogen bond in TFE/H2O mixtures and through favorable interactions of hydrophobic amino acid side chains with TFE (19Luo P. Baldwin R.L. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 8413-8421Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar, 28Cammers-Goodwin A. Allen T.J. Oslick S.L. McClure K.F. Lee J.H. Kemp D.S. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 3082-3090Crossref Scopus (241) Google Scholar). The peptide hydrogen bonds in the helix are believed to be stabilized indirectly by weakening the hydrogen bonding of water molecules to the peptide backbone in the coil form (28Cammers-Goodwin A. Allen T.J. Oslick S.L. McClure K.F. Lee J.H. Kemp D.S. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 3082-3090Crossref Scopus (241) Google Scholar). As a result of weakening the hydrophobic interactions within the protein interior, TFE denatures native proteins and promotes helical structure in most peptides and proteins, even though this is nonnative helical structure (7Buck M. Schwalbe H. Dobson C.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13219-13232Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 8Fan P. Bracken C. Baum J. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 1573-1582Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 9Sönnichsen F.D. Van Eyk J.E. Hodges R.S. Sykes B.D.

In contrast, TMAO increases the driving forces for protein folding. We recently found that osmolytes use a new molecular force for protein folding originating from the unfavorable interaction of the TMAO with the peptide backbone (30Wang A. Bolen D.W. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 9101-9108Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). Due to its solvophobic effect on the backbone, TMAO forces thermodynamically unstable proteins to fold without altering the rules for folding to a native-like conformation (10Baskakov I.V. Bolen D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4831-4834Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar).The action of both solutes, TMAO and TFE, focus on the peptide backbone, and this ensures that the effect of both solutes are general in scope, because the backbone is the most prevalent structural element of the protein fabric. In opposition to TFE solution, the propensities of hydrophobic groups to interact with solvent are essentially the same in water as they are in TMAO solution (30Wang A. Bolen D.W. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 9101-9108Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). Thus, due to weakening the hydrophobic interactions the dominant effect of TFE on protein is denaturation with preferential formation of α-helices as a result of strengthening peptide hydrogen bonds, whereas TMAO forces unfolded proteins to fold by providing an additional force for folding that has no preference for any particular secondary structure. Based on the molecular origin of TMAO-driven protein folding, if biologically relevant structure can be induced into the transactivation region of hGR (or any other intrinsically unstructured AAD) without its target molecule, it is more likely to be induced by solutes (like TMAO) that have been selected in nature for their ability to fold and stabilize proteins than it is by alcohols. Our fluorescence and CD data support the earlier observation that the transactivation domain AF1 of the hGR is largely unstructured (4Dahlman-Wright K. Baumann H. McEwan I.J. Almlof T. Wright A.P.H. Gustafsson J.-A. Hard T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1699-1703Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Because the hGR with AF1 deleted has only 25–30% transactivation activity of the holo-hGR, the AF1 region is clearly important for determination of the level of transcription of genes that are under glucocorticoid regulation (20Almlof T. Wright A.P.H. Gustafsson J.-A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17535-17540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The AF1 of the hGR is a member of a large family of activation domains (AAD) defined by their richness in acidic residues and little sequence similarity (2Hahn S. Cell. 1993; 72: 481-483Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Since many such domains are rich in acidic amino acids, previous work led to the idea that acidic residues are crucial for the function of AADs (21Mitchell P.J. Tjian R. Science. 1989; 245: 371-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (2185) Google Scholar). According to the “acidic blob” concept (22Sigler P.B. Nature. 1988; 333: 210-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar), AADs do not adopt a defined structure in vivo, rather it functions by general ionic interactions with target proteins. However, mutagenesis studies of hGR AF1 demonstrate that acidity is not the most important determinant of activity, and negative charges per se are not sufficient for activation (20Almlof T. Wright A.P.H. Gustafsson J.-A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17535-17540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 23Mason S.A. Housley P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21501-21504Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Rather, key hydrophobic amino acids appear to be crucial for activity (24Almlof T. Gustafsson J.-A. Wright A.P.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 934-945Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). That the hGR AF1 might be structured in vivo is suggested by the pattern of AF1 degradation in cell-free extracts, which show defined degradation products that are inconsistent with the indiscriminate proteolysis expected for an unfolded peptide (20Almlof T. Wright A.P.H. Gustafsson J.-A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17535-17540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Structural studies have shown that AADs have the propensity to form α-helical structure in the presence of alcohols, and several proline substitution mutants reduce both helix-forming potential and transactivation activity (4Dahlman-Wright K. Baumann H. McEwan I.J. Almlof T. Wright A.P.H. Gustafsson J.-A. Hard T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1699-1703Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 5Schmitz M.L. Silva M.A.S.

Chem. 1992; 267: 1411-1414Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Keeping in mind the ability of AADs to form α-helix in the presence of alcohols, one could hypothesize that acidic activation domains are unstructured in vivo until they adopt a more ordered conformation when directly involved in transcriptional activation, according to the induced-fit model of folding (3Frankel A.D. Kim P.S. Cell. 1991; 65: 717-719Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). The major concern over using alcohols (TFE, chloroethanol) to probe secondary structures of peptides and proteins is the question of the relevance of alcohol-induced structure to the biologically important conformations of the proteins. These alcohols are such potent inducers of α-helices that helices are forced to occur in peptides/proteins, whereas such structures may be unlikely to exist in vivo(7Buck M. Schwalbe H. Dobson C.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13219-13232Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 8Fan P. Bracken C. Baum J.

https://openalex.org/W2047324455,"Previous studies have demonstrated that β-arrestin1 serves to target G protein-coupled receptors for internalization via clathrin-coated pits and that its endocytic function is regulated by dephosphorylation at the plasma membrane. Using the yeast two-hybrid system, we have identified a novel β-arrestin1-binding protein, NSF ( N-ethylmaleimide-sensitivefusion protein), an ATPase essential for many intracellular transport reactions. We demonstrate that purified recombinant β-arrestin1 and NSF interact in vitro and that these proteins can be coimmunoprecipitated from cells. β-Arrestin1-NSF complex formation exhibits a conformational dependence with β-arrestin1 preferentially interacting with the ATP bound form of NSF. In contrast to the β-arrestin1-clathrin interaction, however, the phosphorylation state of β-arrestin1 does not affect NSF binding. Functionally, overexpression of NSF in HEK 293 cells significantly enhances agonist-mediated β2-adrenergic receptor (β2-AR) internalization. Furthermore, when coexpressed with a β-arrestin1 mutant (βarr1S412D) that mimics a constitutively phosphorylated form of β-arrestin1 and that acts as a dominant negative with regards to β2-AR internalization, NSF rescues the βarr1S412D-mediated inhibition of β2-AR internalization. The demonstration of β-arrestin1-NSF complex formation and the functional consequences of NSF overexpression suggest a hitherto unappreciated role for NSF in facilitating clathrin coat-mediated G protein-coupled receptor internalization. Previous studies have demonstrated that β-arrestin1 serves to target G protein-coupled receptors for internalization via clathrin-coated pits and that its endocytic function is regulated by dephosphorylation at the plasma membrane.

The demonstration of β-arrestin1-NSF complex formation and the functional consequences of NSF overexpression suggest a hitherto unappreciated role for NSF in facilitating clathrin coat-mediated G protein-coupled receptor internalization. Many G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), 1The abbreviations used are: GPCR, G protein-coupled receptor; β2-AR, β2-adrenergic receptor; GRK, GPCR kinase; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; SNAP, soluble NSF attachment protein; SNARE, SNAP receptor; N-domain, amino-terminal domain. such as the β2-adrenergic receptor (β2-AR), utilize classical clathrin-coated vesicle pathways for internalization. Several lines of evidence indicate that phosphorylation of the receptor by a G protein-coupled receptor kinase (GRK) followed by β-arrestin binding are crucial steps in this process (reviewed in Refs. 1Ferguson S.S. Zhang J. Barak L.S. Caron M.G. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1996; 24: 953-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 2Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol.

Biochem. 1998; 67: 653-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (1072) Google Scholar). The role of GRK-mediated receptor phosphorylation in the internalization of receptors is to facilitate the binding of β-arrestins. β-Arrestins serve a dual role in the regulation of GPCRs. First, they mediate rapid desensitization by binding to GRK-phosphorylated receptors, sterically interdicting signaling to the G protein (4Pippig S. Andexinger S. Daniel K. Puzicha M. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Lohse M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3201-3208Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Second, they target receptors for internalization via clathrin-coated pits, allowing subsequent dephosphorylation and resensitization of the receptors (5Lin F.T. Krueger K.M. Kendall H.E. Daaka Y. Fredericks Z.L. Pitcher J.A. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31051-31057Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Thus, a mutated form of the β2-AR (Y326A) that is a poor substrate for the GRKs fails to undergo agonist-dependent internalization. However, receptor internalization can be rescued by overexpressing GRKs (6Ferguson S.S. Menard L. Barak L.S. Koch W.J. Colapietro A.M. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24782-24789Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Similarly, overexpressing β-arrestin1 with the Y326A mutant also rescues receptor internalization (7Ferguson S.S. Downey W.E.J. Colapietro A.M. Barak L.S. Menard L. Caron M.G. Science. 1996; 271: 363-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar). Further confirming the essential role of β-arrestins in the internalization process is the finding that dominant negative forms of β-arrestin1, namely V53D (8Zhang J. Barak L.S. Winkler K.E. Caron M.G. Ferguson S.S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27005-27014Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar) and βarr1S412D (5Lin F.T. Krueger K.M. Kendall H.E. Daaka Y. Fredericks Z.L. Pitcher J.A. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31051-31057Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar), dramatically impair agonist-stimulated receptor sequestration. It has been previously demonstrated that β-arrestin1 and 2 bind directly and stoichiometrically to clathrin (9Goodman Jr., O.B. Krupnick J.G. Santinin F. Gurevich V.V. Penn R.B. Gagnon A.W. Keen J.H. Benovic J.L. Nature. 1996; 383: 447-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (1179) Google Scholar) and that the function of β-arrestin1 in GPCR internalization is regulated by phosphorylation/dephosphorylation of the β-arrestin1 molecule (5Lin F.T. Krueger K.M. Kendall H.E. Daaka Y. Fredericks Z.L. Pitcher J.A. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31051-31057Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Cytoplasmic β-arrestin1 is constitutively phosphorylated on a carboxyl-terminal serine (Ser-412) and is recruited to the plasma membrane upon agonist stimulation of the receptor, where it becomes rapidly dephosphorylated. Dephosphorylation of β-arrestin1 is required for clathrin binding and the subsequent targeting of receptors to clathrin-coated pits but not for receptor binding and receptor desensitization. It is interesting to note that other members of the arrestin family (visual arrestin, β-arrestin2, and splice variants) do not possess the Ser-412 residue and are therefore not subject to the same regulation as β-arrestin1. Whether the ability of β-arrestin1 to promote GPCR internalization arises solely as a consequence of its ability to bind clathrin or whether additional β-arrestin1-binding proteins are involved in this process remains to be determined. In an attempt to further define the role of β-arrestin1 in the regulation of GPCR function, we used the yeast two-hybrid system to screen for novel β-arrestin1-binding proteins. The full cDNA of rat β-arrestin1 was subcloned into the yeast expression vector pGBT9 using EcoRI and BamHI. Following amplification inEscherichia coli, the pGBT9 β-arrestin1 plasmid was transformed into yeast strain HF7c, and a yeast two-hybrid screen was carried out essentially according to the CLONTECHMATCHMAKER protocol using a GAL4 activation domain fusion library in pGAD10 (MATCHMAKER rat whole brain cDNA library,CLONTECH). Interacting proteins were isolated by growth selection on Trp, His, and Leu dropout plates and subsequently by filter β-galactosidase assays. Isolated library clones were analyzed by DNA sequencing using an ABI automated DNA sequencer (Howard Hughes Nucleic Acid Facility, Duke University). The plasmids of interest were transfected into either HEK 293 cells (for sequestration assays) or COS cells (cellular coimmunoprecipitation) using LipofectAMINE according to the manufacturer's instructions (Life Technologies, Inc). To determine the association of β-arrestin1 and NSF, COS cells were cotransfected with either Flag-tagged β-arrestin1 (or Flag-tagged βarr1S412A and βarr1S412D) and/or His6-NSF-c-Myc, pcDNA3 empty vector was used as a control. Cells were harvested in lysis buffer (LB; 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 250 mmNaCl, 10% glycerol, 2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm ATP, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride 25 μg/ml apoprotin, and 1 μm leupeptin). The β-arrestins were immunoprecipitated using a polyclonal M2 antibody specific to the Flag epitope. The proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE. Western blot analysis was performed using a monoclonal antibody specific for NSF (6E6). NSF was visualized using either ECL or quantitated using alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibody (Amersham) followed by phosphoimager analysis. The nitrocellulose was stripped of immunoglobulin, and β-arrestin1 was visualized or quantitated using an polyclonal antibody specific for β-arrestin1 (19Attramadal H. Arriza J.L. Aoki C. Dawson T.M. Codina J. Kwatra M.M. Snyder S.H. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17882-17890Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to confirm equal expression of the β-arrestins. Cellular coimmunoprecipitations were carried out as described above. COS-1 cells were cotransfected with plasmids encoding either empty vector, Flag-β-arrestin1, NSF, or Flag-β-arrestin1 plus NSF. Flag-β-arrestin1 was immunoprecipitated using an M2 monoclonal antibody specific for the Flag epitope. Immunoprecipitates were washed three times with LB buffer, then equally divided, and transferred to fresh tubes. One-half of each immunoprecipitate was given a final wash with LB buffer containing 0.5 mm ATP and 2 mm EDTA (ATP/EDTA), and the other half was washed with LB buffer containing 2 mm EDTA plus 10 mmMgCl2 (ATP/Mg2+) to allow ATP hydrolysis on the immunoprecipitated NSF. Immunoprecipitates were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. NSF was visualized using the 6E6 monoclonal antibody and quantitated by phosphoimager analysis. Immunoblots were stripped of IgG and reprobed for β-arrestin1 using an antibody specific to β-arrestin1, such that the amount of NSF immunoprecipitated under nonhydrolyzable versus hydrolyzable conditions could be normalized to the amount of β-arrestin1 immunoprecipitated. Agonist-induced β2-AR internalization was determined by immunofluorescence flow cytometry analysis as has been described previously (31). HEK 293 cells were transiently transfected with the plasmid encoding a Flag-tagged β2-AR and either a pcDNA3 control vector, a β-arrestin1 expression plasmid (β-arrestin1 or βarr1S412D), an NSF expression vector, or NSF with βarr1S412D. Receptor fluorescence was defined as signal above the fluorescence of untransfected cells. Sequestration is defined as the fraction of total cell surface receptors that are removed from the plasma membrane (and thus are not accessible to antibodies added to the cells) following agonist treatment. To identify novel proteins that interact with β-arrestin1 we screened a rat brain cDNA library using a full-length β-arrestin1 cDNA as bait in the yeast two-hybrid system screen (10Fields S. Song O. Nature. 1989; 340: 245-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (4880) Google Scholar). Several clones positive for His− cell growth and β-galactosidase expression were isolated including a cDNA clone encoding a portion of the amino-terminal region of NSF ( N-ethylmaleimide-sensitivefusion protein (NSF) (Fig.1). This clone was found to require the Gal4 DNA-binding domain-β-arrestin1 fusion for activity. NSF is an ATPase whose hydrolytic activity has previously been demonstrated to play an essential role in intracellular membrane trafficking (11Rothman J.E. Nature. 1994; 372: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (2011) Google Scholar). Through its interaction with soluble NSF attachment proteins (SNAPs), NSF binds to a group of membrane receptors referred to as SNAP receptors (SNAREs) to form a complex known as the “20 S particle” (12Sollner T.

The region of NSF found to bind β-arrestin1 lies within the N-domain, identified as the binding domain for other proteins known to interact with NSF (16Nagiec E.E. Bernstein A. Whiteheart S.W. J.

Because the yeast two-hybrid system can detect weak interactions that may not occur under physiological conditions, we sought to confirm the yeast interaction data both in vitro and in a mammalian expression system. Recombinant β-arrestin1 and recombinant NSF (both purified from E. coli) were incubated in the presence of ATP/EDTA (nonhydrolyzable conditions). β-Arrestin1 was immunoprecipitated using a polyclonal antibody directed against β-arrestin1 (19Attramadal H. Arriza J.L. Aoki C. Dawson T.M. Codina J. Kwatra M.M. Snyder S.H. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17882-17890Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The immunoprecipitates were subsequently probed for NSF using a monoclonal antibody directed against this protein (Fig.2 A, upper panel). A similar experiment was performed whereby NSF was immunoprecipitated and the immunoprecipitates were immunoblotted for β-arrestin1 (Fig.2 A, lower panel). β-Arrestin1 and NSF formed a complex in vitro in a manner that was dependent upon the concentration of the two protein components. To determine whether NSF and β-arrestin1 associate in intact cells, a cDNA encoding NSF was cotransfected into COS cells with cDNA encoding Flag-tagged β-arrestin1. The association of NSF with β-arrestin1 was examined by immunoprecipitating β-arrestin1 and analyzing the isolated immunoprecipitates for NSF content. As shown in Fig. 2 B, in the absence of NSF overexpression, a complex of β-arrestin1 and endogenous cellular NSF is detected (Fig.2 B, compare no βarr1 with βarr1 only). Moreover, overexpression of NSF increases the amount of β-arrestin1-NSF complex immunoprecipitated (Fig. 2 B, compare βarr1 only and βarr1 + NSF). These results demonstrate that β-arrestin1 and NSF interact in cells. Coupled with the data showing an association between these proteins in vitro, this suggests that the β-arrestin1-NSF interaction may be of physiological relevance. It has previously been shown that the phosphorylation state of β-arrestin1 regulates its endocytic function; the dephosphorylated form of β-arrestin1 preferentially binds to clathrin and promotes GPCR internalization (5Lin F.T. Krueger K.M. Kendall H.E. Daaka Y. Fredericks Z.L. Pitcher J.A. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31051-31057Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). The binding of β-arrestin1 to the β2-AR, however, is independent of its phosphorylation state (5Lin F.T. Krueger K.M. Kendall H.E. Daaka Y. Fredericks Z.L. Pitcher J.A. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31051-31057Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Therefore, we investigated the effect of β-arrestin1 phosphorylation on NSF binding. Two β-arrestin1 phosphorylation mutants, where Ser-412 has been replaced with either alanine (βarr1S412A) or aspartate (βarr1S412D) have been described previously (5Lin F.T. Krueger K.M. Kendall H.E. Daaka Y. Fredericks Z.L. Pitcher J.A. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31051-31057Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). The βarr1S412A mutant has been shown to simulate the dephosphorylated form of β-arrestin1, whereas the βarr1S412D mutant has been shown to mimic its phosphorylated form. The association of NSF with wild type β-arrestin1, βarr1S412A, or βarr1S412D was comparable (Fig. 2 B). The observation that β-arrestin1-NSF complex formation is not dependent on the phosphorylation state of β-arrestin1 suggests that NSF could potentially interact with β-arrestin1 either in the cytosol (phosphorylated β-arrestin1) and/or at the plasma membrane (dephosphorylated β-arrestin1). β-Arrestin1 has been shown to translocate from the cytosol to the plasma membrane and colocalize with clathrin-coated vesicles following agonist activation of the β2-AR (8Zhang J. Barak L.S. Winkler K.E. Caron M.G. Ferguson S.S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27005-27014Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Thus, interaction of β-arrestin1 with NSF may serve to target NSF to the clathrin-coated vesicles following GPCR activation. The association of NSF with its previously identified binding partners (SNAPs, SNAREs, and more recently the GluR2 subunit of the AMPA receptor) (17Nishimune A. Isaac J.T. Molnar E. Noel J. Nash S.R.

NSF has been shown to bind stably to SNARE complexes and does not dissociate from them when locked in the ATP state (13Hanson P.I. Roth R. Morisaki H. Jahn R. Heuser J.E. Cell. 1997; 90: 523-535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar). To determine whether β-arrestin1 binding to NSF is also modulated by the nucleotide status of NSF, immunoprecipitations from cells were performed either in the presence of ATP/EDTA or ATP/Mg2+(ATP nonhydrolyzable and hydrolyzable conditions, respectively). As seen in Fig. 3. NSF preferentially coimmunoprecipitated with β-arrestin1 in the presence of ATP/EDTA. The binding of NSF and β-arrestin1 was significantly impaired under conditions in which ATP is hydrolyzed (ATP/Mg2+). Notably, a mutant NSF capable of binding but not hydrolyzing ATP (E329Q; described in Ref. 15Whiteheart S.W. Rossnagel K. Buhrow S.A. Brunner M. Jaenicke R. Rothman J.E. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 945-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar) showed no significant difference in β-arrestin1 binding in the presence of ATP/EDTA or ATP/Mg2+ (data not shown). β-Arrestin1 has been shown to promote internalization (also referred to as sequestration) of agonist-occupied β2-AR (7Ferguson S.S. Downey W.E.J. Colapietro A.M. Barak L.S. Menard L. Caron M.G. Science. 1996; 271: 363-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar). If the β-arrestin1-NSF interaction is important in regulating GPCR function, then given the well characterized role of NSF in vesicle trafficking, overexpression of NSF might also regulate β2-AR internalization. Thus, HEK 293 cells were transfected with Flag-tagged β2-AR alone or with wild type β-arrestin1, βarr1S412D, NSF, or NSF and βarr1S412D. Consistent with previously published results (20Menard L. Ferguson S.S.G. Zhang J. Lin F.T. Lefkowitz R.J. Caron M.G. Barak L.S. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 51: 800-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar), overexpression of β2-AR with β-arrestin1 in HEK 293 cells results in a modest enhancement of β2-AR sequestration, and overexpression of the βarr1S412D (5Lin F.T. Krueger K.M. Kendall H.E. Daaka Y. Fredericks Z.L. Pitcher J.A. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31051-31057Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar) mutant results in a reduction of β2-AR sequestration compared with cells transfected with β2-AR only (Fig.4). Dramatically, NSF overexpression enhances β2-AR sequestration approximately 2-fold. Furthermore, coexpression of NSF and the βarr1S412D mutant in HEK 293 cells appears to rescue the dominant negative effect of βarr1S412D, such that sequestration was found to be comparable with that in cells expressing β2-AR only (Fig. 4). Coexpression of wild type β-arrestin1 with NSF did not further enhance NSF-stimulated β2-AR sequestration (data not shown). NSF exists in both cytosolic and membrane-associated forms and was originally purified on the basis of its ability to complement in vitro intra-Golgi transport reactions that had been blocked by treatment with N-ethylmaleimide (21Block M.R. Rothman J.E. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 219: 300-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). NSF has a general role in vesicular transport and functions at most if not all vesicular transport events by virtue of its action on SNARE proteins. SNARE proteins have been classified into two families known as v-SNAREs (vesicle membrane receptor) and t-SNAREs (target membrane receptor) (12Sollner T. Bennett M.K. Whiteheart S.W. Scheller R.H. Rothman J.E. Cell. 1993; 75: 409-418Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1586) Google Scholar). The cognate pairing of a v-SNARE with a t-SNARE leads to the formation of a docking complex for membrane fusion to occur. The formation of this complex, termed the 20 S particle, is ATP-dependent. ATP hydrolysis by NSF disassembles the 20 S complex releasing the v-SNARE and t-SNAREs, thereby recycling these components for future fusion events (reviewed in Ref. 11Rothman J.E. Nature. 1994; 372: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (2011) Google Scholar). The observation that the neuronal SNAREs, syntaxin (v-SNARE) and synaptobrevin (t-SNARE), no longer interact with NSF following one round of ATP hydrolysis indicates that some structural modification occurs in one or both of these NSF-binding proteins (22Hanson P.I. Otto H. Barton N. Jahn R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16955-16961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Taken together, these observations suggest that NSF promotes conformational changes in proteins with which it interacts in an ATP-dependent manner. That the function of NSF is not restricted to vesicular transport is suggested by the observation that NSF binds to the AMPA receptor (17Nishimune A. Isaac J.T. Molnar E. Noel J. Nash S.R. Tagaya M.

AMPA receptors are a class of ionotropic glutamate receptors that mediate fast synaptic transmission and are composed of subunits GluR1-GluR4. Notably, NSF can bind directly to the GluR2 subunit of the AMPA receptor, providing the first example of an NSF cell surface receptor interaction (17Nishimune A. Isaac J.T. Molnar E. Noel J.

Kamboj S. Xia J. Dong H. Liao D. Huganir R.L. Neuron. 1998; 21: 393-400Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). NSF and GluR2 exist in a complex in brain extracts not only with each other but also with SNAPs (18Osten P. Srivastava S. Inman G.J. Vilim F.S. Khatri L. Lee L.M. States B.A. Einheber S. Milner T.A.

Neuron. 1998; 21: 393-400Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). The GluR2-SNAP-NSF complex resembles the SNARE-SNAP-NSF complex in being disassembled by ATP hydrolysis (18Osten P. Srivastava S. Inman G.J. Vilim F.S. Khatri L. Lee L.M. States B.A. Einheber S. Milner T.A. Hanson P.I. Ziff E.B. Neuron. 1998; 21: 99-110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). However, in contrast to the classical 20 S particle, NSF can bind directly to GluR2 independently of SNAPs. The binding site for NSF maps to a short region of the cytoplasmic tail of GluR2 distinct from the very carboxyl-terminal domain that interacts with the PDZ protein, GRIP (24Dong H.R.J. Brien O. Fung E.T. Lanahan A.A. Worley P.F. Huganir R.L. Nature. 1997; 386: 279-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (758) Google Scholar). GRIP is believed to serve as a molecular scaffold on which a large complex of proteins is constructed, including AMPA receptors. It has been suggested that ATP hydrolysis by NSF may disassemble AMPA receptor interaction with GRIP leading to mobilization, insertion or internalization of the receptor (reviewed in Ref. 25Lin J.W. Sheng M. Neuron. 1998; 21: 267-270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Identification of an interaction between β-arrestin1 and NSF brings together two proteins previously found to be associated with clathrin-coated vesicles. β-Arrestin1 has been shown to interact with clathrin and target receptors to clathrin-coated pits for internalization (9Goodman Jr., O.B. Krupnick J.G. Santinin F. Gurevich V.V. Penn R.B. Gagnon A.W. Keen J.H. Benovic J.L. Nature. 1996; 383: 447-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (1179) Google Scholar). NSF has been shown to be associated with membranes derived from clathrin-coated vesicles (26Steel G.J. Tagaya M. Woodman P.G. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 745-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Purified clathrin-coated vesicles not only contain significant amounts of NSF but are enriched in the ability to support formation of 20 S fusion complexes. The current model for β2-AR internalization requires agonist-activated receptor to recruit β-arrestin to the plasma membrane, where it binds receptor. Following receptor binding, β-arrestin1 targets the receptor to clathrin and promotes receptor internalization. By analogy with the many proposed roles of NSF in vesicular transport, one can envisage several possible functions of NSF binding to β-arrestin1 that might involve the NSF-driven association/disassociation of β-arrestin1 with/from receptor and/or other components of the clathrin-coated vesicle. One potential role for the interaction of NSF with β-arrestin1 may be to alter the conformation of β-arrestin1, thereby regulating the interaction of this protein with other components of the endocytic pathway. One β-arrestin1-binding partner whose interaction with β-arrestin1 could potentially be facilitated by NSF is clathrin. This may provide a potential explanation for the observation that overexpression of NSF is able to rescue the dominant negative effect of the βarr1S412D mutant. βarr1S412D is believed to behave as a dominant negative with regards to β2-AR internalization due to a reduced ability to bind clathrin (5Lin F.T. Krueger K.M. Kendall H.E. Daaka Y. Fredericks Z.L. Pitcher J.A. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31051-31057Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Because NSF binds equally well to βarr1S412D and wild type β-arrestin1, NSF could potentially induce conformational changes in βarr1S412D, increasing its affinity for clathrin, thus allowing internalization to proceed. Whether or not NSF has effects on regulating the interaction of β-arrestin with clathrin (and potentially other coat components) remains to be determined. A possible role of NSF in β2-AR internalization by mediating vesicle fusion during endocytosis is presently unclear, because any potential SNAREs for this process have yet to be identified. An alternative role for the NSF-β-arrestin1 interaction, by analogy to the proposed role of NSF in the AMPA-GRIP interaction, is that NSF binding to β-arrestin1 might involve the NSF-driven dissociation of the β2-AR-β-arrestin1 complex from elements of the cytoskeleton. NSF ATP hydrolysis might possibly release the receptor from some constraining influence, leading to mobilization and internalization. A detailed investigation of the function of β-arrestin1-NSF complex formation may reveal hitherto unsuspected roles for NSF in clathrin coat-mediated endocytosis. We thank Drs. Randy Hall and Thomas Sollner for helpful discussion; Dr. James Rothman for providing purified NSF, NSF antibody (6E6), plasmids encoding His6-NSF-c-Myc, and His6-NSF(E329Q)-c-Myc; and W. Carl Stone for providing purified β-arrestin1. We also thank Donna Addison and Mary Holben for excellent secretarial assistance."

Heparan sulfate chains are ubiquitous as proteoglycans on cell surfaces and in the extracellular matrix. They have been increasingly implicated in various biological processes including cell growth, cell differentiation, blood coagulation, and viral and bacterial infections (1Salmivirta M. Lidholt K.

Heparan sulfation is catalyzed by a group of the Golgi-membrane enzymes called heparan sulfate sulfotransferases. The superfamily includes also a large number of cytosolic sulfotransferases that sulfate low molecular weight substrates such as steroids, bioamines, pharmaceutical drugs, and environmental chemicals.

It remains to be structurally determined whether these motifs are also conserved in heparan sulfate sulfotransferases.

The reaction mechanisms and specific substrate binding that lead to the diverse heparan sulfations are poorly understood. The bi-functional enzyme HSNST sequentially deacetylates and sulfates the amino group of the disaccharide glucuronic acid-N-acetylglucosamine (GlcA-GlcNAc) unit of heparan sulfate (10Eriksson I.

Pedersen L.C. Wall F.E. Pedersen L.G. Negishi M. FEBS Lett. 1998; 433: 211-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Human NST1 is similar to the corresponding domain of mouse HSNST reported by Berninsone and Hirschberg (13Berninsone P. Hirschberg C.B. J. Biol.

Subsequently, site-directed mutagenesis has shown that Lys-614 is a critical residue for NST1 catalysis (12Sueyoshi T. Kakuta Y. Pedersen L.C. Wall F.E. Pedersen L.G. Negishi M. FEBS Lett. 1998; 433: 211-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Using NST1 crystals grown as previously reported (12Sueyoshi T. Kakuta Y. Pedersen L.C. Wall F.E. Pedersen L.G. Negishi M. FEBS Lett. 1998; 433: 211-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), we now describe herein the crystallographic structure NST1. This structure displays the conserved nature of the structure of the PAP-binding site and identifies possible catalytic residues. In addition, a substrate binding site is suggested from the structure. Selenomethionyl NST1, using a pGEX-4T3-NST1 plasmid, was expressed in the methionine auxotrophic Escherichia colistrain B834 (DE3) with a defined minimal essential medium (without methionine) containing 50 mg of selenomethionine per 1 liter of culture. The NST1 was then purified, and crystals (P21212 or P21) were grown under the same conditions as described previously (14Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38573) Google Scholar). Heparan sulfate sulfotransferase activity of NST1 was also measured according to the previously described procedure (12Sueyoshi T. Kakuta Y. Pedersen L.C. Wall F.E. Pedersen L.G. Negishi M.

Two MAD data sets of selenomethionyl NST1 were collected at −180 °C from two separate single crystals (both P21212) on a MAR detector at beamline X9B of the NSLS, Brookhaven National Laboratory. Three wavelengths were selected from the fluorescence spectra: f1 (0.97163 Å: remote), f2 (0.97907 Å: peak), and f3 (0.97940 Å: edge) (Table I). Native data of an NST1 crystal (P21) were collected at −180 °C on an R-axis IV with an RU300 rotating anode generator.Table IData collection and refinement statisticsData collectionData setf1 (set 1)f2 (set 1)f3 (set 1)f1 (set 2)f2 (set 2)f3 (set 2)nativeNSLSNSLSNSLSNSLSNSLSNSLSRaxis IVSpace groupP21212P21212P21212P21212P21212P21212P21Unit cell parameters (Å)a = 89.13a = 89.50a = 89.44a = 89.24a = 88.73a = 88.46a = 45.42b = 55.36b = 55.60b = 55.55b = 55.42b = 55.25b = 55.15b = 54.50c = 66.41c = 67.01c = 66.92c = 66.68c = 66.44c = 66.36c = 68.94beta = 100.053No. of crystals1111111Resolution (Å)2.852.852.853.23.23.22.3No. of unique reflections64396897661358005731570513992Redundancy6.56.36.44.56.76.72.6% Completeness (total)79.583.780.510010099.993.7(last shell)99.690.285.710010010080R sym(total)1R sym = ∑‖I i− 〈I〉‖/∑I i, whereI i is the intensity of the ith observation and 〈I〉 is the mean intensity of the reflection.9.811.19.312.115.49.49.8(last shell)25.029.425.320.626.916.124.1Refinement statisticsData setnativeResolution (Å)50–2.3R cryst/R free(%)1R = ∑∥F o‖ − ‖F c∥/∑‖F o‖, whereR cryst is calculated using 95% of the reflections in refinement and R free is calculated using the remaining 5%.21.0/25.7No. of waters73r.m.s. deviations from idealityBond lengths (Å)0.007Bond angles (deg)1.3Dihetral angles (deg)25.0Improper angles (deg)0.63a R sym = ∑‖I i− 〈I〉‖/∑I i, whereI i is the intensity of the ith observation and 〈I〉 is the mean intensity of the reflection.b R = ∑∥F o‖ − ‖F c∥/∑‖F o‖, whereR cryst is calculated using 95% of the reflections in refinement and R free is calculated using the remaining 5%.

Because of heavy ice rings in data set 1 and data set 2 being weak, F(A)s were calculated with CCP4 (15Collaborative Computational Project Number 4 Acta Crystallogr. Sec. D. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19770) Google Scholar) using data between 20 and 4 Å of data set 1. Positions for four of the six selenium atoms were determined using SHELX96 (16Sheldrick G.M. Dauter Z. Wilson K.S. Hope H. Sieker L.C. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. D. 1993; 49: 18-23Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Data set 1 was reprocessed to eliminate all reflection near the ice rings between 3.95 and 3.1 Å. Subsequently, the reprocessed data set 1 was merged with data set 2 to obtain a complete data set to 2.85-Å resolution. SHARP (17delaFortelle E. Bricogne G. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 472-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (1797) Google Scholar) was then used for refinement of the selenium sites. Solvent flattening and histogram matching were carried out using DM and Solomon from CCP4 (15Collaborative Computational Project Number 4 Acta Crystallogr. Sec. D. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19770) Google Scholar). In the model building process using O (18Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeledgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13011) Google Scholar), SigmaA maps were generated by combining the phases from polyalanine fragments with the MAD phases (15Collaborative Computational Project Number 4 Acta Crystallogr. Sec. D. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19770) Google Scholar). After multiple cycles of positional, torsion angle, and b factor refinements using X-PLOR (19Brunger A.T. Kuriyan J. Karplus M. Science. 1987; 235: 458-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (2126) Google Scholar), the R-factor and R free were 23.8 and 31.9%, respectively. Because some of the loop regions still lacked interpretable density, molecular replacement was employed to determine phases for the data from the P21 crystal. Multiple cycles of manual rebuilding and refinement using the P21 data at 2.3 Å reduced the R andR free factors to 20.9 and 25.8%, respectively. The stereochemistry of the refined model was verified using PROCHECK (15Collaborative Computational Project Number 4 Acta Crystallogr. Sec. D. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19770) Google Scholar). Data collection and refinement statistics are summarized in TableI. The coordinates have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank with code 1NST. The overall structure of NST1 is roughly spherical with an open cleft (Fig. 1 A). This structure is composed of a five-stranded parallel β-sheet (β1, β2, β3, β4, and β5) with α helices on both sides of the β-sheet (Fig. 1 B). This fold is similar to EST (the 1.9-Å r.m.s. deviation for 97 Cαs in β1, β3, β4, β5, α1, α6, α11, α12, and α13) as well as to the nucleotide binding motif observed in nucleotide kinases (20Murzin A.G. Brenner S.K. Hubbard T. Chothia C. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 247: 536-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (5595) Google Scholar). The loop between β1 and α1 adopts the same PSB-loop configuration as the 5′-phosphate binding site of PAPS. A cavity formed between the PSB-loop, and α6 defines the PAP binding site. Three β strands (β6, β7, and β8) near the C terminus form an anti-parallel β-sheet with a single disulfide bond between β7 and β8. An open cleft that runs perpendicular to the PAP binding cavity is large enough to contain a hexasaccharide chain. The α6 and random coil between β2 and α2 constitute the cleft near the 5′-phosphate of PAP and thus may constitute part of the substrate binding site. The secondary structural elements that comprise the PAP binding site in NST1 and residues forming specific interactions to the PAP molecule are depicted (Fig. 2), respectively. The PSB-loop (residues 612–617) and α1 of NST1 constitute the 5′PSB motif and provide the major binding sites for the 5′-phosphate of the PAP molecule. Backbone amide nitrogens from PSB-loop residues 614–618 are all within hydrogen bonding distance of the 5′-phosphate. The side-chain Nζ of Lys-614 and the Oγs of both Thr-617 and Thr-618 are also hydrogen-bonded to the 5′-phosphate. α6 and β4 are the key elements of the 3′PB motif, and the Oγ of Ser-712 from this helix forms a hydrogen bond to the 3′-phosphate of the PAP molecule. The PAP molecule in NST1 is bound in the same orientation (relative to the PSB-loop) as seen in EST. The PAP binding site, found in the EST structure determined previously, is conserved. The r.m.s. deviation (with EST) for 47 Cαs in α1, α6, β1, β4, and PSB-loop is 1.16 Å. The anti-parallel β-sheet (β6, β7, and β8) and the following random coil provide the remaining interactions for the PAP binding site (Fig. 2). These interactions reveal diversity in the binding site of NST1. The side-chains of Lys-833 and Tyr-837 from this random coil are within hydrogen bonding distance to two oxygen atoms of the 5′-phosphate and the oxygen atom of the 3′-phosphate, respectively. Besides these side-chain interactions, the backbone nitrogens of Gly-834 and Arg-835 are also within hydrogen bonding distance of a 3′-phosphate oxygen of the PAP molecule. The adenine ring from the PAP molecule is in position to form a parallel ring stacking interaction with Phe-816 of β7. Moreover, the backbone oxygen of Trp-817 is within hydrogen bonding distance to the N-6 of the adenine. The interactions of these residues with the PAP molecule are unique features in NST1 that are not present in the crystal structure of the EST-PAP complex (8Kakuta Y. Pedersen L.G. Carter C.W. Negishi M. Pedersen L.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 904-908Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Lys-614 of NST1 is known to be conserved in other heparan sulfate sulfotransferases as well as in all cytosolic sulfotransferase (9Kakuta Y. Pedersen L.G. Pedersen L.C. Negishi M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 129-130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 12Sueyoshi T. Kakuta Y. Pedersen L.C. Wall F.E. Pedersen L.G. Negishi M. FEBS Lett. 1998; 433: 211-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Although this residue plays a critical role in NST1 activity (12Sueyoshi T. Kakuta Y. Pedersen L.C. Wall F.E. Pedersen L.G. Negishi M. FEBS Lett. 1998; 433: 211-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), the structural basis of its role in catalysis has remained unresolved. The crystal structure of the EST-PAP-vanadate complex (Fig.3) has recently been solved and has provided a possible transition state template for the sulfuryl transfer reaction (21Kakuta Y. Petrotchenko E.V. Pedersen L.C. Negishi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27325-27330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Superimposition of NST1 on this structure indicates that the side-chains of Lys-614 (in NST1) and Lys-48 (in EST) exhibit a similar orientation and conformation (Fig. 3). Nζ of Lys-614 is found to be directly coordinated to an oxygen of the PAP molecule in NST1. This oxygen is also coordinated to Lys-48 (Nζ) in EST and is implicated as the bridge oxygen of the leaving phosphate group of PAP (21Kakuta Y. Petrotchenko E.V. Pedersen L.C. Negishi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27325-27330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Moreover, the mutation of Lys-614 to Arg gives a variant with a significant level of NST1 activity (63 ± 7.0 and 9.4 ± 2.4 nmol of sulfate/min/mg of protein in the wild-type and K614R mutant, respectively), whereas the K614A mutation abolishes activity completely (12Sueyoshi T. Kakuta Y. Pedersen L.C. Wall F.E. Pedersen L.G. Negishi M. FEBS Lett. 1998; 433: 211-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). These structural and mutational data suggest that Lys-614 may act as a possible proton donor in catalysis, similar to Lys-48 in EST (21Kakuta Y. Petrotchenko E.V. Pedersen L.C. Negishi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27325-27330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Lys-833 of NST1 is also coordinated with the bridge oxygen (Fig. 3). Lys-833 is, in fact, conserved not only in Caenorhabditis elegans HSNST but also in human heparan sulfate 3-O-sulfotransferase (see the sequence alignments in Shworaket al. (22Shworak W.N. Liu J. Fritze M.L Schwartz J.J. Zhang L. Logeart D. Rosenberg D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28008-28019Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar)). Thus, Lys-833 and its counterparts may play a significant role in catalysis. In sharp contrast to the hydrophobic pocket of estrogen binding site in EST, the putative substrate binding site of NST1 appears to be a large open cleft with a hydrophilic surface, with a random coil (residues 640–647, approximately 12 Å in length) and α6 forming the center of the cleft near the 5′-phosphate of the PAP molecule. This amphipathic random coil positions negatively charged side-chains (Glu-641, Glu-642, Gln-644, and Asn-647) toward the center, whereas the hydrophobic side-chains (Ile-643, Phe-645, and Phe-656) are buried in the hydrophobic core of NST1. The side-chains of residues (Trp-713, His-716, Gln-717, and His-720) in α6 constitute the opposing face of the cleft. The center of this cleft (approximate dimensions: 12 Å in length, 8 Å in width, and 8 Å in depth) is large enough to accommodate a trisaccharide unit of polysaccharide chain. Further studies, such as the determination of the complex structure of NST1 complexed with polysaccharide, are needed to conclude whether this center portion of the cleft is, in fact, the substrate binding site. The striking similarities between the PAP binding orientation in NST1 and EST provide structural evidence that the Golgi membrane and cytosolic enzymes belong to the same family of enzymes. The similar topology and function of Lys-614 to Lys-48 of EST suggest a common reaction mechanism in all sulfotransferases. Lys-833 may be an additional catalytic residue not present in the cytosolic enzymes. The NST1 structure provides an excellent model for investigating the substrate specificity of heparan sulfate sulfotransferases so that we may better understand sulfation at specific positions of glucuronic acid-N-acetylglucosamine."

Protein trafficking into and out of the Golgi complex requires multiple populations of membrane-bound vesicles or tubules. Each vesicle population is associated with distinct sets of coat complexes, G proteins, and SNARE proteins designed to ensure the selective trafficking of cargo proteins. The Golgi complex is also associated with diverse cytoskeletal elements, and Golgi-derived vesicles must, it now appears, carry multiple molecular motors in order to interact with different cytoskeletal structures (1Fath K.R.

Bridgman P.C. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 439-449Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and diverse roles, ranging from synaptic vesicle transport (13Prekeres R. Terrian D.M. J.

Recent studies show that some isoforms of cytoskeletal proteins associate uniquely with the Golgi, suggesting that the Golgi has its own, dedicated cytoskeleton. A Golgi-specific kinesin-like protein (Rab-kinesin; Ref. 15Echard A. Jollivet F. Martinez O. Lacapere J.J. Rousselet A. Janoueix-Lerosey I. Goud B.

Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 1239-1249Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have been identified. The potential roles of actin filaments and their associated proteins in either maintaining Golgi structure or in vesicular trafficking are not well understood. In most cells the Golgi complex is closely aligned with the microtubule-organizing center, but such a morphologically distinct, stable connection to the Golgi complex is not evident for microfilaments. The association of actin and actin-binding proteins with Golgi membranes might therefore be more dynamic. The use of actin-polymerizing or -depolymerizing drugs has served to generally implicate the actin cytoskeleton in vesicular trafficking, especially in endocytic pathways in intact cells (19Heuser J. Cell Biol. Int. Rep. 1989; 13: 1063-1076Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 20Shurety W. Stewart N.L. Stow J.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 957-975Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Secretory yeast mutants have provided the most direct evidence for a requirement for actin in vesicular transport. The temperature-sensitive mutant of Myo2p, a myosin V gene product of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, has defective post-Golgi transport and accumulates vesicles destined for the vacuole and for exocytosis (21Santos B.

These studies demonstrate that the actin cytoskeleton, at some level, does participate in vesicle trafficking, but specific roles for actin in various stages of vesicle budding, transport, or targeting remain unknown. Proteins participating in vesicular transport interact with highly specific membrane domains, either on cisternal membranes in different parts of the Golgi stack or on selected vesicles. The distribution of individual proteins thus often indicates their sites of action in different pathways or steps of vesicle transport. The current study was undertaken to determine the distributions of actin and actin-associated proteins with Golgi membranes and with Golgi-derived vesicles. Using anin vitro assay to generate different populations of Golgi-derived vesicles, we have analyzed the distinct arrays of actin, myosins II, tropomyosin isoforms, and other proteins associated with different membrane domains. Probably through the actions of one or more of these proteins, newly budded vesicles have the ability to bind to actin filaments. The monoclonal antibody (mAb) AD7, which recognizes p200/myosin II, has previously been characterized (4Narula N. McMorrow I. Plopper G. Doherty J. Matlin K.S. Burke B. Stow J.L. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 27-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Three antibodies were used to detect tropomyosin isoforms; the CG3 mAb raised against a peptide encoded by the TmNM5 gene (27Novy R.E. Sellers J.R. Liu L.-F. Lin J.J.-L. Cell Motil. Cytoskel. 1993; 25: 267-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) reacts with its Tm5NM-1, -2, -3, and -4 isoforms. A subset of these isoforms (Tm5NM-1 and 2) is more specifically recognized by the WS5/9d antibody raised against the product of the 9d exon (28Weinberger R. Schevzov G. Jeffrey P. Gordon K. Hill M. Gunning P. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 238-252Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).

Briefly, a post-nuclear supernatant of homogenized rat liver was layered onto a discontinuous sucrose gradient consisting of 2.5 ml of 1.3 m and 0.86 m sucrose solutions overlaid with 2 ml of 0.25 m sucrose. The gradients were centrifuged at 144,000 × g for 70 min. The supernatant of the 0.5 m sucrose layer was collected as cytosol, and the band above the 0.86 m sucrose interface was harvested as Golgi membranes. Snap-frozen cytosol and membrane samples were re-ultracentrifuged prior to use. An in vitro assay for vesicle budding was used (31de Almeida J.B. Doherty J. Ausiello D.A. Stow J.L. J.

The reaction was terminated by incubation for 10 min in an ice-water slurry. The remnant (unbudded) Golgi cisternae were separated from the cytosol containing free vesicles by differential centrifugation (17,500 × gfor 10 min at 4 °C). Vesicles were then separated from cytosol by discontinuous sucrose gradient centrifugation on 200 μl of 2.1m sucrose, overlaid with 200 μl of 20% sucrose (w/w), and 2 ml of the cytosol/vesicle mixture (100,000 × gfor 90 min at 4 °C). All sucrose solutions were prepared in HKM buffer. The cytosol was collected from the loading zone, and the budded vesicles were harvested at the 2.1 m/20% interface. For vesicle separation, free vesicles were resuspended in a total volume of 400 μl of 20% sucrose and layered onto a discontinuous sucrose gradient consisting of 300 μl of each of the following sucrose solutions: 50%, 45%, 40%, 35%, 30%, and 25% (w/w) (33Serafini T. Rothman J.E. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 219: 286-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The gradient was centrifuged for 18 h at 100,000 ×g at 4 °C. The isopycnic gradient was fractionated from the bottom in 220-μl fractions by syringe puncture. Fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. Rat liver cytosol was precleared by ultracentrifugation (100,000 × g, 45 min, 4 °C), and aliquots (1 mg) were incubated in vesicle budding assay buffer (HKM buffer) supplemented with 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm GTPγS, in the presence or absence of 5 mmMgATP at 37 °C for 45 min. Jasplakinolide (JAS, Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) was added at a final concentration of 1 μm to polymerize/stabilize F-actin; we have shown previously that under these conditions cytosolic G-actin is efficiently converted to F-actin (20Shurety W. Stewart N.L. Stow J.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 957-975Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). F-actin was pelleted from the cytosol by low speed centrifugation (17,500 × g, 30 min, 4 °C), then washed in HKM buffer, and aliquots representing 100% of the F-actin pellet and 10% of the remaining cytosol supernatant were loaded onto SDS-PAGE gels and analyzed by immunoblotting to identify proteins coprecipitated with F-actin. To analyze binding of Golgi vesicles to F-actin, vesicle fractions harvested from the vesicle separation gradient were diluted, ultracentrifuged (100,000 × g), and resuspended in HKM buffer. F-actin, polymerized with JAS from cytosol, was prepared in the presence of MgATP, to avoid saturation with soluble myosin II. Pelleted, washed F-actin was resuspended and incubated with the vesicle fractions in the presence of GTPγS for 30 min at 37 °C. F-actin was then repelleted by centrifugation at low speed, and the resulting pellets and supernatants were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting to detect actin-bound vesicle-associated proteins and by electron microscopy to examine actin-bound vesicles. Samples for SDS-PAGE were separated on 5–15% gradient gels (34Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207192) Google Scholar). Proteins were transferred onto Immobilon-P membrane in 15 mm Tris, 120 mmglycine, 20% methanol; membranes were routinely stained with 0.1% Coomassie Brilliant Blue R250 to check protein loading. For immunoblotting, transfers were blocked in Blotto (20 mmTris, 150 mm NaCl, 5% skim milk, 1% Triton X-100), antibody incubations were carried out in Blotto for 1–2 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C, and bound antibodies were detected with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibodies with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate/nitro blue tetrazolium or with chemiluminescence. Golgi-enriched membranes and budded vesicles generated in the in vitro budding assay were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline overnight at 4 °C, collected on Formvar/carbon-coated copper grids by floating grids on 5-μl drops of suspensions of fixed budded membranes for 5 min at room temperature, then washed and stained with 1.8% methylcellulose containing 0.4% uranyl acetate for 10 min on ice. Negative contrast of whole mounts was obtained by staining with 1% uranyl acetate for 1 min and removal of excess stain with Whatman filter paper. Specimens were examined in a Joel 1010 transmission electron microscope. NIH 3T3 fibroblasts grown at 8000 cells/cm2 on poly-l-lysine substrate were serum-starved for 48 h, causing them to withdraw from the cell cycle into the G0 (quiescent) phase of the cell cycle. Quiescent fibroblasts were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with chilled (−20 °C) methanol, and then double-immunostained with the WS5/9d antibody together with the 58K antibody that detects a peripheral Golgi membrane protein and the AD7 antibody. Goat anti-rabbit-conjugated lissamine rhodamine and goat anti-mouse-conjugated fluorescein secondary antibodies were used for detection. Staining patterns were analyzed by confocal scanning laser microscopy (Wild Leitz Instruments, Heidelberg, Germany). In vitro budding assays were performed using rat liver Golgi membranes and cytosol in the presence of GTPγS. Vesicle budding is demonstrated by the de novo membrane binding of two cytosolic proteins, p200/myosin II and β-COP (Fig. 1). Small amounts (<10%) of the coatomer protein β-COP and of p200/myosin II are present on freshly isolated, washed Golgi membranes (Fig. 1). Newly budded vesicles were initially separated from remnant cisternae and cytosol by centrifugation. The budded vesicle pellet is enriched in p200/myosin II and β-COP, compared with the original Golgi membranes, showing that coated vesicles have been generated during the assay and that these cytosolic proteins have specifically bound to them (Fig. 1). Some of the bound p200/myosin II and β-COP on the remnant Golgi cisternae (Fig. 1) represents attachment to additional budding sites or to budding vesicles that have not yet been released. Golgi-derived vesicles were then separated on a second gradient, and fractions were analyzed by immunoblotting and densitometry to demonstrate the distribution of a range of vesicle-associated proteins (Fig. 2). The distributions of three proteins, p200/myosin II, β-COP, and γ-adaptin, were found to vary across the gradient (Fig. 2). Immunogold labeling has previously confirmed that β-COP (as part of the coatomer or COP I complex), γ-adaptin (a component of AP-1 clathrin-coated vesicles), and p200/myosin II are indeed localized on separate vesicles (5Narula N. Stow J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2874-2878Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 35Stow J.L. Heimann K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1404: 161-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Thus the overlapping, but nevertheless distinct, peak distributions of p200/myosin II, β-COP, and γ-adaptin correspond to different populations of vesicles (Fig. 2). β-COP has a broader distribution throughout the gradient peaking at fractions F3–F7, and these same vesicles are labeled for p23, an integral membrane protein of coatomer-coated vesicles and the cis-Golgi-network (36Nickel W.

Lin R.C. Scheller R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17961-17965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2 A). The peak distribution of p200/myosin II is in fractions F1–F5, but as yet there is no endogenous transmembrane marker with which to determine the identity of these vesicles. To ensure that the protein pattern reflects the distribution of membrane-bound proteins on vesicles in this gradient, the gradient was loaded with 1 mg of precleared cytosol and run under identical conditions. Soluble cytosolic proteins were found to distribute in fractions F8–F10 (data not shown); in these fractions, we are therefore unable to distinguish between vesicle-bound and soluble proteins (Figs. 2 A and 3 B). However, proteins in fractions F1–F7 were also analyzed on flotation gradients and were confirmed as being membrane-bound (data not shown). Thus, this gradient allows distinction and partial separation of three Golgi-derived vesicle populations demarked by the vesicle-associated proteins p200/myosin II, β-COP, and γ-adaptin.Figure 3Distribution of actin and actin binding proteins. A, β-actin was analyzed in fractions from the in vitro budding reaction by immunoblotting. Lane 1, cytosol; lane 2, isolated Golgi membrane; lane 3, cytosol containing the budded vesicles; lane 4, remnant Golgi cisternae; lane 5, remnant cytosol; lane 6, total budded vesciles. Total budded vesicles were separated from the remnant cytosol by ultracentrifugation on a sucrose step gradient. B, the distribution of actin and actin-binding proteins in the vesicle gradient was determined by immunoblotting. Actin distributes evenly across the gradient. p200/myosin II and myosin IIA are similarly in fractions F1–F5, while myosin IIB has a different distribution (F5–F8). Centractin peaks in F3–F6 along with β-COP. Tropomyosin isoforms recognized by the αf9d antibody are clustered in fractions F8 and F9, most likely representing a cytosolic distribution. Tm5 tropomyosins recognized by CG3 are found in fractions containing cytosol (F8 and F9) and are also in a specific vesicle population (F1–F4).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Other vesicle-associated proteins were also detected on newly budded vesicles (Fig. 2 A). Dynamin was distributed throughout the vesicle gradient and was not concentrated in any one vesicle population. The dynamin antibody used can recognize both dynamin I and dynamin II, and the two bands appearing in these gels could represent two isoforms or splice variants of dynamin. Rab 6, a monomeric G protein on Golgi membranes, was identified in fractions F3–F8, corresponding most closely to the distribution of β-COP labeled vesicles (Fig. 2 A). Small amounts of Rab 4 were found in the gradient codistributing with the peak γ-adaptin-labeled vesicles and barely detectable levels of Rab 5 were found in fractions toward the top of the gradient. While the bulk of vesicles on this gradient were generated from Golgi membranes, detection of these early endosome-associated Rabs indicates a very small contamination by plasma membrane/early endosome derived vesicles, possibly AP2 vesicles. The gradient separation of vesicle populations provided a basis for analyzing the differential distribution of vesicle-associated cytoskeletal proteins. By immunoblotting, it was noted that β-actin was routinely present in fractions of Golgi membranes and vesicles (Fig. 3 A). While most of the β-actin is found in the cytosol (Fig. 3, TableI), 7% of the β-actin present is on newly isolated stacked Golgi membranes. We routinely found that some of the total membrane-bound β-actin was lost to the cytosol during the budding assay, possibly due to dissociation or depolymerization of actin. However, some of the actin remains bound to remnant cisternae and a consistent proportion (3% of total) of the β-actin binds to the budded vesicles (Fig. 3, Table I). β-Actin bound to all populations of vesicles and was evenly distributed across all of the fractions of the vesicle gradient (Fig. 3 B). Each vesicle fraction contained approximately 0.3% of the total vesicle-associated β-actin. Centractin was detected at low levels throughout the gradient but was particularly concentrated in the β-COP-labeled vesicle population (Fig. 3 B), suggesting that it does bind preferentially to these vesicles. p200/myosin II, which has been identified as nonmuscle myosin IIA, is found on one of the TGN-derived vesicle populations, and immunoblotting with an antibody raised against the heavy chain of nonmuscle myosin IIA shows a similar distribution peaking in fractions F1–F5, as expected. In contrast, the nonmuscle myosin IIB isoform has a different distribution, peaking in fractions F6–F8. The distribution of membrane-bound myosin IIB overlaps with that of γ-adaptin vesicles, while some of the myosin IIB, in the higher fractions, may also be cytosolic (Fig. 3 B). These results now show that more than one population of Golgi-derived vesicles is associated with a member of the myosin II family and that myosin II isoforms are targeted separately to specific vesicle-budding membrane domains.Table IRelative proportions of β-actin in assay fractionsFractionsCGS1P1S2P2Total β-actin (%)93799≤1963A reproducible fraction of β-actin (7%) is bound to Golgi membranes in isolated Golgi stacks (G). Most of the β-actin in the assay is present in soluble form in the cytosol (C). Some of the membrane-bound β-actin is present in total budded vesicles (P2, 3%) or remains on Golgi cisternae (P1). The amounts of β-actin in SDS-PAGE gel fractions were analyzed by immunoblotting and densitometry. These data are representative of three experiments. S1, cytosol + vesicles; S2, remnant cytosol. Open table in a new tab A reproducible fraction of β-actin (7%) is bound to Golgi membranes in isolated Golgi stacks (G). Most of the β-actin in the assay is present in soluble form in the cytosol (C). Some of the membrane-bound β-actin is present in total budded vesicles (P2, 3%) or remains on Golgi cisternae (P1). The amounts of β-actin in SDS-PAGE gel fractions were analyzed by immunoblotting and densitometry. These data are representative of three experiments. S1, cytosol + vesicles; S2, remnant cytosol. Tropomyosin isoforms were analyzed on Golgi membranes and budded vesicles using two antibodies. Blotting with the αf9d antibody shows several low and high molecular mass (30–38 kDa) isoforms of the αTmfast and β-TM gene families in fractions at the top of the gradient, which may represent the presence of cytosolic proteins (Fig. 3 B). We found no evidence for αTmfast and β-TM tropomyosins binding to Golgi membranes before budding (data not shown) or to newly budded vesicles (Fig. 3 B). Probing with an antibody (CG3) that sees all isoforms of the Tm5 gene family reveals a single band, which could represent more than one isoform, and this was present in both Golgi membrane and cytosol fractions. On the vesicle gradient, the Tm5 band is seen in fractions at the top of the gradient (F8–F9) which are likely to represent cytosolic Tm5, and in fractions F1–F4, clearly representing Tm5 bound to selected vesicles. Tm5 in these lower fractions of the gradient coincides with the distribution of p200/myosin II-labeled vesicle population (Fig. 3 B). In order to further investigate whether p200/myosin II and Tm5 are colocalized on the same vesicles, or are on different populations of co-migrating vesicles, immunostaining was carried out with the AD7 antibody to p200/myosin II and with an antibody (WS5/9d) that recognizes a subset of Tm5 gene products. Fig.4 shows a quiescent 3T3 fibroblast labeled with the 58K antibody and the WS5/9d antiserum. Two isoforms (Tm5NM-1 and -2) co-localize identically with the 58K Golgi peripheral membrane protein in an asymmetric perinuclear fashion. However, fibroblasts double-stained with p200/myosin II (Fig. 4 C) and WS5/9d (Fig. 4 D) showed intense but mutually exclusive perinuclear staining patterns, suggesting that Tm5 isoforms and p200/myosin II are enriched in different compartments of the Golgi complex (Fig. 4, C and D, arrows). Comparison of p200/myosin II staining with TGN38 showed that both proteins colocalized and were enriched in the TGN (Fig. 4, Eand F, respectively). This suggests that at least some of the Tm5 isoforms recognized by CG3 in the liver Golgi fractions are on separate vesicles from p200/myosin II. These observations demonstrate an actin-based structural complexity of the Golgi-derived vesicle network, and suggest that specific microfilament populations may have unique roles"

https://openalex.org/W2015637535,"Mature Arabidopsis seeds are enriched in storage proteins and lipids, but lack starch. In the shrunken seed 1 (sse1) mutant, however, starch is favored over proteins and lipids as the major storage compound. SSE1 has 26 percent identity with Pex16p in Yarrowia lipolytica and complements pex16 mutants defective in the formation of peroxisomes and the transportation of plasma membrane- and cell wall-associated proteins. In Arabidopsis maturing seeds, SSE1 is required for protein and oil body biogenesis, both of which are endoplasmic reticulum-dependent. Starch accumulation in sse1 suggests that starch formation is a default storage deposition pathway."

Glycopeptides with 1, 3, 5, and 6 GalNAc residues (G1, G3, G5, and G6) were obtained, and their sizes were confirmed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry.

A calcium-type human macrophage lectin (HML) was prepared in a recombinant form, and its interaction with these glycopeptides was investigated by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) spectroscopy and fluorescence polarization. The affinity of recombinant HML (rHML) for immobilized glycopeptides increased, as revealed by SPR, in parallel with the number of GalNAc. The highest affinity was obtained when the G6-peptide was immobilized at high density.

Carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD) fragments of HML were prepared, and their affinity for these four glycopeptides was also determined, this affinity was apparently lower than that of rHML. Affinity constants of rHML for the G3- and G5-peptides were 11- and 38-fold higher, respectively, than for the G1-peptide, whereas those of CRD fragments were only 2- and 6-fold higher, respectively. A chemical cross-linking study revealed that rHML but not recombinant CRD forms trimers in an aqueous solution.

(1Drickamer K. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 9557-9560Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) comprise a large family of recognition molecules in the immune system. Their specificity and potential regulatory functions demand a perspective far beyond the traditional concept of lectins (1Drickamer K. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 9557-9560Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Gabius H.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 243: 543-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). A C-type lectin specific for galactose (Gal) andN-acetyl-d-galactosamine (GalNAc) as a monosaccharide has been found in histiocytic macrophages in mice (3Mizuochi S. Akimoto Y. Imai Y. Hirano H. Irimura T. Glycobiology. 1997; 7: 137-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). A very similar lectin is also expressed in human macrophages as preferentially bound glycopeptides containing consecutive serine (Ser) and threonine (Thr) residues with attached GalNAc, which is well known as a carcinoma-associated Tn antigen (4Suzuki N. Yamamoto K. Toyoshima S. Osawa T. Irimura T. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 128-135PubMed Google Scholar). While these C-type lectins are assumed to play roles in the recognition of malignant cells, their immunological roles are actually more diverse (5Kawakami K. Yamamoto K. Toyoshima S. Osawa T. Irimura T. Jpn. J. Cancer Res. 1994; 85: 744-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 6Imai Y. Akimoto Y. Mizuochi S. Kimura T. Hirano H. Irimura T.

In rats, a lectin homologous to these molecules was shown to be up-regulated in the area of chronic rejection of heart transplants in rats (8Russell M.E. Utans U. Wallace A.F. Liang P. Arceci R.J. Karnovsky M.J. Wyner L.R. Yamashita Y. Tarn C. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 94: 722-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). It has long been known that other C-type lectins produced by hepatocytes are involved in asialoglycoprotein uptake from the circulation; macrophage C-type lectins from rodents seem to function in the same fashion (5Kawakami K. Yamamoto K. Toyoshima S. Osawa T. Irimura T. Jpn. J. Cancer Res. 1994; 85: 744-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 9Ozaki K. Ii M. Itoh N. Kawasaki T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9229-9235Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Because the interactions of some lectins with simple monosaccharides are sometimes weak, the direct binding of these lectins with a monosaccharide may be difficult to determine. If the cooperative effects of polyvalent carbohydrate ligands are present, however, and the lectin has multivalency, a dramatic increase in the affinity could prevail (2Gabius H.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 243: 543-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar, 10Weis W.I. Drickamer K. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 441-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (995) Google Scholar, 11Rini J.M. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomed. 1995; 24: 551-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). Members of the C-type lectin family often form oligomeric structures through the stalk regions containing the α-helical domain; this provides an advantage in polyvalent binding (12Beavil A.J.

Although the multivalency of carbohydrate ligands is seen in a variety of native glycoproteins, particularly O-linked glycoproteins, its functions in carbohydrate-recognition pathogenic processes are not well known. Furthermore, differences in the kinetics of protein-carbohydrate interactions between monosaccharide and multivalent ligands were unknown until recently. The first step toward determining the significance of HML in the pathogenesis of a variety of diseases was the cDNA cloning and sequencing of human macrophage lectin (HML), described in a previous report (4Suzuki N. Yamamoto K. Toyoshima S. Osawa T. Irimura T. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 128-135PubMed Google Scholar). The next step should be to elucidate the nature of natural ligand for this lectin. In the previous study, HML was demonstrated to preferentially bind clusters ofN-acetylgalactosamine linked to Ser or Thr in a carcinoma-associated mucin-like configuration (4Suzuki N. Yamamoto K. Toyoshima S. Osawa T. Irimura T. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 128-135PubMed Google Scholar).Epithelial mucins are characterized by their tandem repeat domains, which contain many Ser and Thr residues (20Gendler S.J. Spicer A.P. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1995; 57: 607-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (858) Google Scholar, 21Kim Y.S. Gum J. Brockhausen I. Glycoconjugate J. 1996; 13: 693-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). The tandem repeat portion of the MUC2 mucin consists of 23 amino acids, including 14 Thr residues; these Thr residues are reported to be glycosylated up to 78% in the LS174T colon carcinoma cell line (22Byrd J.C. Nardelli J. Siddiqui B. Kim Y.S. Cancer Res. 1988; 48: 6678-6685PubMed Google Scholar). Although the tandem repeat domain of MUC2 mucin in other cells is also thought to be highlyO-glycosylated, whether the glycosylation patterns in different cells and tissues are unique is not yet understood. Mucin architecture represents an ideal framework for a variety of multiple ligand arrangements that should serve as a recognition unit. In the present study, we applied the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) biosensor and fluorescence polarization (FP) spectroscopy to analyze ligand-density dependence in carbohydrate-protein interactions.DISCUSSIONTo examine the interaction of HML with GalNAc residues arranged on peptides, we prepared short synthetic glycopeptides corresponding to a portion of the tandem repeat domain of MUC2 mucin with different numbers of attached GalNAc residues. Molecular sizes were determined by MALDI-TOF MS, and the locations of the incorporated residues were determined by peptide sequencing. Kinetics of the binding were examined in both the fluid-solid phase with SPR and the fluid-fluid phase with FP; both equilibrium-binding assays of the interaction of rHML with immobilized glycopeptides revealed that the number of GalNAc residues does affect K D. Affinity of the G3-peptide (PTGalNAcTTPITGalNAcTGalNAcTT[K]) for HML was 11-fold greater than that of the G1-peptide (PTTTGalNAcPITTTTK) and that of the G5-peptide was 38-fold greater; when K D values were normalized according to the number of GalNAc residues, the increases were 3.5- and 7.6-fold, respectively.Differences in affinity for CRD fragments of G3 and G5 relative to G1, based on the molar amount of glycopeptide, were 2- and 6-fold, respectively; differences based on the number of GalNAc residues were 0.7- and 1.2-fold, respectively. Therefore, rHML fragments but not CRD fragments revealed a drastic increase in affinity that depended on the number of GalNAc residues present. The differences among G1-, G3-, and G5-peptides should be due to the increased avidity of polyvalent ligands. This effect was more prominent with rHML than with CRD fragments due to the oligomeric nature of rHML, whereas CRD fragments apparently remained in monomeric in aqueous solutions (Fig. 1).The G5- and G6-peptides were shown to contain three consecutive Thr-linked GalNAc residues, i.e. Tn antigen. Anti-trimeric Tn mAb (26Reddish M.A. Jackson L. Koganty R.R. Qiu D. Hong W. Longenecker B.M. Glycoconjugate J. 1997; 14: 549-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) was shown to bind these glycopeptides. It has already been shown that rat hepatic lectin, a type of trimeric C-type lectin, also bound preferentially to clustered GalNAc residues, as shown by using synthetic cluster glycosides based on Tris (17Lee R.T. Lee Y.C. Glycoconjugate J. 1987; 4: 317-328Crossref Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 18Lee Y.C. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 3193-3200Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Therefore, in addition to the impact of increased number of GalNAc residues, three consecutive Thr attached with GalNAc residues might also contribute to the high binding affinity for HML.Dense immobilization of all of the synthetic glycopeptides leads to high affinity association. The difference between densely immobilized and sparsely immobilized glycopeptides seemed to be due to the dramatic decrease in the dissociation rates (Table I). Although the organization of the densely immobilized glycopeptides on the membranes was unknown, the binding of anti-trimetric Tn mAb strongly suggested that some GalNAc residues from separate glycopeptides were located very close to each other; thus, the clustering of GalNAc residues may well be one of the more important factors in the high affinity of HML (Fig. 6). Because the immobilization was done via biotin-streptavidin, it may be unconceivable that the distance of GalNAc would be as close as to mimic a single amino acid distance between them. Thus, the spacing among the carbohydrate chains may contribute to macromolecular ligand interactions with HML, as observed in amebic lectin binding (16Adler P. Wood S.J. Lee Y.C. Lee R.T. Petri Jr., W.A. Schnaar R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5164-5171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). There may be another level at which clusters in macromolecular carbohydrate ligands contribute to high affinity (18Lee Y.C. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 3193-3200Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Simulation by x-ray crystallography (29Sheriff S. Chang C.Y. Ezekowitz A.B. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 789-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar) has revealed three binding sites of trimeric mannose binding protein spaced approximately 4.5 nm apart. If HML also accommodates such a structure, GalNAc residues spaced more sparsely than trimeric Tn might be required for viable ligand-carbohydrate interactions.The results of FP equilibrium-binding assays, with one exception, were consistent with the findings from the experiments using the SPR biosensor, K D for G1-peptides from SPR (1.0 μm for rHML) was higher than K D based on FP binding data (6.8 μm for rHML and 8.3 μm for CRD). The difference might be due to an increase in conformational stability on solid surfaces. It is also probable that the solid phase configuration was more appropriate for the formation of the multiple attachment sites preferred by oligomeric lectin than are glycopeptides in solutions. Collectively, slightly lower constants from FP assays in fluid-fluid phases than those from SPR measurements seemed to be reasonable. From FP assays conducted under ideally diluted conditions, K D values between monovalent lectin and GalNAc monosaccharide can be obtained by the Scatchard plot (Fig. 6). All K D values reported here were based on the monovalent ligand-monovalent receptor model. Such analysis was used because the binding of multivalent lectins to multivalent glycopeptides is inherently more complex than are antigen-antibody interactions, and thus it is difficult to simulate the factors involved in a simple equation (14MacKenzie C.R. Hirama T. Deng S. Bundle D.R. Narang S.A. Young N.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1527-1533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). The results, however, fit well with the single-site binding model. It is possible, then, that, regardless of the valency, binding of rHML might be an “all-or-nothing” event with no intermediate forms, as discussed by Adler and co-workers (16Adler P. Wood S.J. Lee Y.C. Lee R.T. Petri Jr., W.A. Schnaar R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5164-5171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar).In microtiter assays, rHML bound only GalNAc α- or β-monosaccharide-BPPs linked directly to the spacer arm on the polymer backbone. A GalNAc residue located away from the polymer backbone, such as those in the Forrsman disaccharide and the blood group A-type trisaccharide (Fig. 2), did not have strong affinity with HML. On the contrary, a low albeit significant affinity for HML by these oligosaccharides was detected through measurement on the SPR biosensor (data not shown). Such a discrepancy might be due to different steric hindrances in the access of this lectin to the binding sites using these two methods. The preferred ligand structure for HML binding was multiple GalNAc residues attached to linear backbones, regardless of the specific synthetic polymers or oligopeptides. As noted above, the Galβ residue attached to the same polymer neither bound directly to the lectin nor inhibited the binding of GalNAc to rHML. These results were consistent with our previous data, which showed that rHML bound neither N-linked carbohydrate chains with terminal Gal residues nor the N-terminal octapeptide of human glycophorin A with three consecutive desializedO-linked carbohydrate chains (4Suzuki N. Yamamoto K. Toyoshima S. Osawa T. Irimura T. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 128-135PubMed Google Scholar). Greater specificity for GalNAc than Gal was also observed with a human hepatic lectin (30Iobst S. Drickamer K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6686-6693Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), in contrast to a mouse macrophage lectin that preferentially bound Gal instead of GalNAc residues (31Imai Y. Irimura T. J. Immunol. Methods. 1994; 171: 23-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 32Hosoi T. Imai Y. Irimura T. Glycobiology. 1998; 8: 791-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Using chimeric and mutagenized CRD fragments of hepatic and macrophage lectin, amino acid residues likely to be involved in the selective binding of GalNAc in the human hepatic lectin were predicted (30Iobst S. Drickamer K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6686-6693Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) (His-256 and Asn-208). These amino acids apparently correspond to His-260 and Tyr-212 in HML, which may be the most important residue in the interaction between HML and GalNAc. HML could serve as an useful model to further investigate the nature of GalNAc-protein interactions.When solutions of either rHML or CRD fragments were incubated in the presence of cross-linking agents, a homotrimer of rHML was the only major oligomeric lectin protein (Fig. 1). The CRD fragments lacking the HML stalk region did not appear to form oligomers. Other members of the C-type lectin family, including CD23, CD72, rat asialoglycoprotein receptor, chicken hepatic receptor, Kupffer cell receptor, and mannose-binding protein, are also known to form oligomers (12Beavil A.J. Edmeades R.L. Gould H.J. Sutton B.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 753-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 29Sheriff S. Chang C.Y. Ezekowitz A.B. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 789-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). The primary amino acid sequence of the stalk region of rHML has a structure known to be involved in oligomer formation. When the amino acid sequence of the stalk region (from Ile-87 to Glu-153) deduced from the nucleotide sequence was arranged in order to accommodate two heptads (a, b, c, d, e, f, and g), hydrophobic residues were arranged at positions a and d in a way that should result in an α-helix coiled-coil. Thus, HML forms a trimeric configuration and would have high affinity for ligands with GalNAc residues such as in the case of CD23 with IgE (13Dierks S.E. Bartlett W.C. Edmeades R.L. Gould H.J. Rao M. Conrad D.H. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 2372-2382PubMed Google Scholar).We have determined affinity constants between HML and peptides with a single GalNAc residue using FP equilibrium-binding assays. A carbohydrate density-dependent increase of affinity for the lectin was revealed, and the increase was more prominent with intact rHML than with CRD fragments. In the present study, variations in the distance between multiple GalNAc residues on a single peptide were not systematically investigated. More dispersed arrangements of GalNAc residues than those used in this study may generate more preferable configurations as functional ligands for HML, and therefore this will be an important subject for future studies.

(1Drickamer K. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 9557-9560Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) comprise a large family of recognition molecules in the immune system. Their specificity and potential regulatory functions demand a perspective far beyond the traditional concept of lectins (1Drickamer K. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 9557-9560Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Gabius H.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 243: 543-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). A C-type lectin specific for galactose (Gal) andN-acetyl-d-galactosamine (GalNAc) as a monosaccharide has been found in histiocytic macrophages in mice (3Mizuochi S. Akimoto Y. Imai Y. Hirano H. Irimura T. Glycobiology. 1997; 7: 137-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). A very similar lectin is also expressed in human macrophages as preferentially bound glycopeptides containing consecutive serine (Ser) and threonine (Thr) residues with attached GalNAc, which is well known as a carcinoma-associated Tn antigen (4Suzuki N. Yamamoto K. Toyoshima S. Osawa T. Irimura T. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 128-135PubMed Google Scholar). While these C-type lectins are assumed to play roles in the recognition of malignant cells, their immunological roles are actually more diverse (5Kawakami K. Yamamoto K. Toyoshima S. Osawa T. Irimura T. Jpn. J. Cancer Res. 1994; 85: 744-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 6Imai Y. Akimoto Y. Mizuochi S. Kimura T. Hirano H. Irimura T.

In rats, a lectin homologous to these molecules was shown to be up-regulated in the area of chronic rejection of heart transplants in rats (8Russell M.E. Utans U. Wallace A.F. Liang P. Arceci R.J. Karnovsky M.J. Wyner L.R. Yamashita Y. Tarn C. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 94: 722-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). It has long been known that other C-type lectins produced by hepatocytes are involved in asialoglycoprotein uptake from the circulation; macrophage C-type lectins from rodents seem to function in the same fashion (5Kawakami K. Yamamoto K. Toyoshima S. Osawa T. Irimura T. Jpn. J. Cancer Res. 1994; 85: 744-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 9Ozaki K. Ii M. Itoh N. Kawasaki T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9229-9235Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because the interactions of some lectins with simple monosaccharides are sometimes weak, the direct binding of these lectins with a monosaccharide may be difficult to determine. If the cooperative effects of polyvalent carbohydrate ligands are present, however, and the lectin has multivalency, a dramatic increase in the affinity could prevail (2Gabius H.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 243: 543-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar, 10Weis W.I. Drickamer K. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 441-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (995) Google Scholar, 11Rini J.M. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomed. 1995; 24: 551-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). Members of the C-type lectin family often form oligomeric structures through the stalk regions containing the α-helical domain; this provides an advantage in polyvalent binding (12Beavil A.J. Edmeades R.L. Gould H.J. Sutton B.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 753-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 13Dierks S.E. Bartlett W.C. Edmeades R.L. Gould H.J. Rao M. Conrad D.H. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 2372-2382PubMed Google Scholar). A similar observation has been made in the binding of carbohydrate-specific antibodies (14MacKenzie C.R. Hirama T. Deng S. Bundle D.R. Narang S.A. Young N.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1527-1533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). For example, synthetic neoglycoproteins and saccharide-derivatized polyacrylamide polymers have been used to represent a multivalent ligand that has a high affinity for lectins (15Bovin N.T.

In other studies, the clustering effects of carbohydrate chains were evaluated in detail through the use of trivalent glycosides (17Lee R.T. Lee Y.C.

To search for novel proteins that interact with Gαo, a mouse brain library was screened using the yeast two-hybrid interaction system. Pcp2 (Purkinje cellprotein-2) was identified as a partner for Gαo in this system. Pcp2 is expressed in cerebellar Purkinje cells and retinal bipolar neurons, two locations where Gαo is also expressed. Pcp2 was first identified as a candidate gene to explain Purkinje cell degeneration in pcdmice (Nordquist, D. T., Kozak, C. A., and Orr, H. T. (1988) J. Neurosci. 8, 4780–4789), but its function remains unknown as Pcp2 knockout mice are normal (Mohn, A. R., Feddersen, R. M., Nguyen, M. S., and Koller, B. H. (1997) Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 9, 63–76). Gαoand Pcp2 binding was confirmed in vitro using glutathioneS-transferase-Pcp2 fusion proteins and in vitrotranslated [35S]methionine-labeled Gαo. In addition, when Gαo and Pcp2 were cotransfected into COS cells, Gαo was detected in immunoprecipitates of Pcp2. To determine whether Pcp2 could modulate Gαo function, kinetic constants k cat andk off of bovine brain Gαo were determined in the presence and absence of Pcp2. Pcp2 stimulates GDP release from Gαo more than 5-fold without affectingk cat. These findings define a novel nucleotide exchange function for Pcp2 and suggest that the interaction between Pcp2 and Gαo is important to Purkinje cell function.

Cell surface receptors coupled to G proteins 1The abbreviations used are: G proteins, guanine nucleotide-binding proteins; GTPγS, guanosine 5′-(γ-thio)triphosphate; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; GST, glutathione S-transferase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; HA, hemagglutinin. enable cells to respond to a wide range of extracellular signals. G proteins, composed of Gα and Gβγ subunits, associate at the plasma membrane in a complex with a serpentine transmembrane receptor. Agonist-liganded receptors activate Gα by inducing a change in conformation that leads to GDP release and GTP-binding. GTP-liganded Gα dissociates from Gβγ, and both subunits can interact with a variety of intracellular effectors. Gα and Gβγ remain activated until the intrinsic GTPase activity of Gα hydrolyzes GTP to GDP. The mechanisms utilized by cells to respond to specific signals in a precise manner is not well understood. In reconstituted systems there is ample evidence that multiple G proteins can couple to the same sets of receptors and effectors (reviewed in Ref. 1Neer E.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 249-257Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1289) Google Scholar), and in transfected cells a single Gα subunit can couple to at least three different effector pathways (2Hunt T.W. Carroll R.C. Peralta E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29565-29570Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). One important mechanism that contributes to regulation of signaling pathways is the existence of proteins that modulate particular points in the pathway. For example, G protein receptor kinases desensitize receptors (such as β-adrenergic receptor kinase, (reviewed in Ref. 3Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18677-18680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (908) Google Scholar) and RGS (regulators of G proteinsignaling) proteins turn off effector responses by accelerating the GTPase activity of Gα subunits (reviewed in Ref. 4Berman D.M. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1269-1272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). Since some G protein family members are predominantly expressed in specific tissues, cell type-specific modulators of G protein signaling are likely to exist. Gαo is a member of the pertussis toxin family of Gα subunits and is predominantly expressed in the central nervous system and heart. Although Gαo comprises 0.2–0.5% of brain particulate protein (5Huff R.M. Axton J.M. Neer E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 10864-10871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), many of its functions are yet to be defined. Gαo couples to several well characterized receptors in the brain and can regulate both N-type Ca+2 channels as well as some K+ channels (see Ref. 6Valenzuela D. Han X. Mende U. Fankhauser C. Mashimo H. Huang P. Pfeffer J. Neer E.J. Fishman M.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1727-1732Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar and references therein). In addition, Gαo can be regulated by neuromodulin (GAP43 (growth cone-associated protein)) in developing neurites (7Strittmatter S.M. Valenzuela D. Kennedy T.E. Neer E.J. Fishman M.C. Nature. 1990; 344: 836-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). Knockout of neuromodulin in mice causes significant abnormalities in neuronal pathfinding (8Strittmatter S.M. Fankhauser C. Huang P.L. Mashimo H. Fishman M.C. Cell. 1995; 80: 445-452Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar), but Gαoknockout mice have anatomically normal brains. Despite the normal central nervous system anatomy in the Gαo knockout mice, they develop a spectrum of neurologic abnormalities (tremor and impairments of motor control and behavior) and shortened survival (6Valenzuela D. Han X. Mende U. Fankhauser C. Mashimo H. Huang P. Pfeffer J. Neer E.J. Fishman M.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1727-1732Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar,9Jiang M. Gold M.S.

We utilized the yeast two-hybrid interaction system to search for unique modulators of Gαo that are expressed in the central nervous system. An interaction between Gαo and Pcp2 (Purkinje cell protein-2), a protein of unknown function expressed in Purkinje cells and retinal bipolar neurons was identified. Although Gαo and Pcp2 have not yet been definitively colocalized in cerebellar Purkinje cells, this interaction was confirmed in vitro and by coimmunoprecipitation from transfected cells. Furthermore, Pcp2 can function as a nucleotide exchange factor by stimulating GDP release from Gαo. Gαo cDNA in pBS (previously described in Ref. 10Denker B.M. Neer E.J. Schmidt C.J. J. Biol.

Gαo-PAS2–1 was used as a “bait” to screen a mouse brain library in pACT (CLONTECH). Both Gαo-PAS2–1 and the mouse brain cDNA libraries were cotransformed into Y190, a yeast lacZ/HIS3 reporter strain, using standard methods. The transformed mix was screened for growth on plates containing selective medium (synthetic complete medium lacking tryptophan, leucine, and histidine in the presence of 25 mm3-aminotriazole) and incubated at 30 °C for 8–12 days. His+ colonies were screened for β-galactosidase activity using a filter lift assay, and positive “blue” colonies (β-galactosidase-positive) were further confirmed by a yeast mating assay. Individual plasmids were transformed into Escherichia coli by electroporation and plasmids analyzed by restriction analysis and dideoxynucleotide sequencing. GenBankTM data bases were screened with each sequence using BLAST analysis. Pcp2 was excised from pACT2 usingEcoRI/XhoI and cloned into pGEX4–2 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The resulting Pcp2-pgex cDNA and pGEX4–2 without insert (GST alone) were transformed into E. coli, and the expressed proteins were purified from bacterial pellets after induction with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. Bacterial lysates were incubated with glutathione-agarose beads (2 ml) and rotated at 4 °C for 30 min. After centrifugation, GST-Pcp2 and GST alone were eluted from beads using glutathione elution buffer for 10 min at room temperature (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Samples were recentrifuged, and the resulting supernatant containing the fusion proteins was analyzed according to the Bradford method to determine protein concentration. Gαo (subtype 1) and Gαi2 in pBS (Gαi2 plasmid construction described in Ref. 11Denker B.M. Boutin P.M. Neer E.J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 5544-5553Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) and Gαs in pcDNAI (from ATCC, Manassas, VA) were used for in vitro translation. Labeled Gα subunits were made using 1 μg of cDNA, appropriate RNA polymerase in a coupled rabbit reticulocyte translation system (TNT system, Promega, Madison WI) plus [35S]methionine (NEN Life Science Products; 20 μCi/reaction) as described previously (11Denker B.M. Boutin P.M. Neer E.J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 5544-5553Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). [35S]Methionine-labeled Gα subunits were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography, and the amounts were normalized by densitometric analysis of translated products (NIH Image 1.61/fat, Wayne Rasband, NIH, Bethesda, MD). Equivalent amounts of fusion proteins (GST or GST- Pcp2) were incubated with glutathione-agarose beads for 30 min at room temperature, followed by incubation with equivalent amounts of in vitro translated [35S]methionine-labeled Gαo, Gαs, or Gαi2 in PBS with 0.05% Triton X-100 overnight at 4 °C with rocking. Beads were centrifuged, washed with PBS with 0.05% Triton X-100 three times, eluted with SDS sample buffer, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. To preserve the HA epitope located at the N terminus of Pcp2 in pACT2, the plasmid was cut with BglII and filled with Klenow to generate a blunt end. Following XhoI digest, the fragment was cloned into the EcoRV/XhoI sites of pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). Gαo in pcDNA3 (12Denker B.M. Saha C. Khawaja S. Nigam S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25750-25753Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) was transfected into COS-7 cells alone or in combination with Pcp2 using LipofectAMINETM (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's protocol. At 72 h after the transfection, cells were washed with ice-cold PBS and lysed for 30 min in lysis buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 6 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 75 mm sucrose, 2.5 mmbenzamidine, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1% Triton X-100). Lysates were cleared by low speed centrifugation, and the supernatant was incubated with the HA-specific monoclonal antibody 12CA5 (1:100) overnight at 4 °C. Protein A-Sepharose (Sigma) was added for 1 h, and the samples were rocked at 4 °C. Samples were then centrifuged, and the pellets were washed three times with PBS with 0.05% Triton X-100. The precipitated proteins were eluted with SDS sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting using a rabbit polyclonal anti-Gαo antibody (5Huff R.M. Axton J.M. Neer E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 10864-10871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and bands were visualized by chemiluminescence (Pierce). Bovine brain Gαo was kindly provided by E. Neer (Harvard Medical School) and used for kinetic analysis in the presence and absence of Pcp2. Pcp2 was prepared from GST fusion proteins by cleavage with thrombin at 2.5 units/mg protein for 1 h at room temperature and separated from GST by incubation with glutathione-agarose beads. Samples were concentrated and protein concentration determined (Bradford). Single turnover GTP hydrolysis (k cat) was determined by incubating Gαo (50 nm) with 1 μm[γ-32P]GTP (5500 cpm/pmol) for 20 min in the presence (1:1 molar ratio) or absence of Pcp2 in buffer A (50 mmTris, pH 7.6, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.1% Triton X-100). The hydrolysis reaction was started by addition of MgCl2 (final concentration, 10 mm) and 100 μm GTP. Aliquots were diluted into 1 ml of 5% (w/v) trichloracetic acid in 5% charcoal and counted as described previously (13Denker B.M. Tempst P. Neer E.J. Biochem. J. 1991; 278: 341-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The amount of γ-32P released at each time point was fit to an exponential function using GraphPad Prism. For determining k off, Gαo (2 pmol) in the presence and absence of Pcp2 or GST (1:1 ratio with Gαo) was incubated in buffer A with 10 mmMgCl2, 1 μm GTP [α-32P]GTP (specific activity 1.1 × 105 cpm/pmol), and 10 μg/ml bovine serum albumin for 20 min at room temperature. The stoichiometry of binding was approximately 60%, and the amount bound prior to initiating nucleotide exchange was set at 100%. GDP dissociation from Gαo was initiated by the addition of 1 mm GDP, and aliquots were filtered onto nitrocellulose, washed, and counted. The data were fit to a one phase exponential decay using GraphPad Prism (San Diego, CA). The yeast two-hybrid interaction system detects low affinity protein interactions and has been successfully used for finding novel proteins that interact with G protein α subunits (14De Vries L. Mousli M. Wurmser A. Farquhar M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11916-11920Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). The initial screen yielded 34 β-galactosidase-positive clones, and this number was reduced to six positive clones after yeast mating controls. These six clones were sequenced and searched in GenBankTM (BLAST) data bases. Three of these cDNAs had no sequence homology to known genes, and one was identified as lactate dehydrogenase. One of the remaining genes was a previously identified human mosaic protein, LGN, that was discovered in a yeast two-hybrid screen using Gαi2 as bait (15Mochizuki N. Cho G. Wen B. Insel P.A. Gene (Amst.). 1996; 181: 39-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The other remaining gene was a full-length clone of PCD5 (now called Pcp2) (16Nordquist D.T. Kozak C.A. Orr H.T. J. Neurosci. 1988; 8: 4780-4789Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) that had been initially identified as a candidate gene important for Purkinje cell development. In pcd mice, Purkinje cells develop normally but then begin to degenerate at 15–18 days after birth leading to the development of ataxia (17Mullen R.J. Eicher E.M. Sidman R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 208-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar). To determine whether Gαo could interact with Pcp2 in an independent assay, GST pull-down experiments were performed. Gα subunits were translated and [35S]methionine-labeledin vitro and then incubated with equivalent amounts of GST or GST-Pcp2 fusion proteins. Fig. 1 shows that in vitro translated Gαo binds to GST-Pcp2 (lane 2), whereas no significant interaction was seen with the GST control protein (black arrow, lane 1). We consistently detected approximately 10% of in vitrotranslated Gαo coprecipitating with GST-Pcp2. Nonspecific interactions of Gαo with GST were less than 1%. We next asked whether the conformation of Gαo affected the interaction with GST-Pcp2. Gαo was preincubated with GTPγS (nonhydrolyzable GTP analogue) or GDP prior to binding. As shown in Fig. 1, the amount of Gαo that associates with Pcp2 is similar irrespective of the nucleotide bound to Gαo. To address the issue of which Gα subunits could interact with Pcp2, two other Gα subunits expressed in the central nervous system were studied. Gαi2 (pertussis toxin family member; ∼70% amino acid identity to Gαo) and Gαs (cholera toxin family member; ∼40% amino acid identity to Gαo) were characterized in pull-down experiments with GST-Pcp2. Equal amounts of 35S-labeled Gαi2 and Gαs were translated in vitro and used for binding to GST proteins, and the amount of nonspecific binding between Gαi2 or Gαswith GST was similar to that seen with Gαo (not shown). Fig. 1 shows that in vitro translated Gαi2interacts with GST-Pcp2, but Gαs is barely detectable in GST-Pcp2 precipitates (lane 6, 52 kDa, open arrow). Taken together, these results suggest that the related pertussis toxin family members (Gαo and Gαi2) interact in vitro with Pcp2 but that Gαs subunits do not. To look for evidence that Gαo and Pcp2 could interact in cells, cotransfection studies were performed in COS cells. COS cells were transfected with Gαo, Pcp2, empty expression vector pcDNA3 (PC) alone or in combination. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated using the 12CA5 antibody directed toward the hemagglutinin epitope on the N terminus of Pcp2 and then analyzed by Western with anti-Gαo antibody (Fig.2). COS cells do not normally express Gαo, and in cells transfected with vector (PC), Pcp2, or Gαo and then immunoprecipitated with 12CA5 there is no detectable Gαo immunoreactivity (Fig. 2,arrow). However, when both Gαo and Pcp2 are cotransfected into the same cells, a fraction of Gαo is found in association with Pcp2 (Fig. 2, lane 4). We were unable to detect Pcp2 in immunoprecipitates of Gαo, presumably due to disruption of the association with Gαoby the stringent detergent conditions necessary to immunoprecipitate Gαo (18Busconi L. Denker B.M. Biochem. J. 1997; 328: 23-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Attempts to detect Gαi2 in Pcp2 immunoprecipitates were unsuccessful, although the level of Gαi2 expression was much lower than for Gαo. The observation that Gαo and Pcp2 interact in an intact cell raises the possibility that Pcp2 could be a modulator of Gαo. There are several possible mechanisms for regulation of Gα subunits by accessory proteins, including effects on nucleotide binding or GTP hydrolysis. To address the possibility that Pcp2 modulates the enzymatic properties of Gαo, we measuredk cat and k off of bovine brain purified Gαo (5Huff R.M. Axton J.M. Neer E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 10864-10871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in the presence and absence of Pcp2. Fig. 3 shows a representative experiment, and the results are summarized in TableI. The k cat andk off values obtained for Gαo are similar to literature values (19Fields T.A Casey P.J. Biochem. J. 1997; 321: 561-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar), and there was no significant difference in k cat of Gαo in presence of Pcp2 (Fig. 3 a and Table I). However, as seen in Fig. 3 b and Table I, there is significant stimulation ofk off in the presence of Pcp2. In experiments simultaneously comparing k off of Gαo in the presence and absence of Pcp2 or GST, there was 5.2 ± 0.5-fold stimulation of k off in the presence of Pcp2 (n = 7). Incubating Gαowith GST had no effect on k off (Fig.3 b and Table I), and including bovine serum albumin in the binding buffer also had no effect. The increase ink off of Gαo in the presence of Pcp2 is similar to the observed increases seen with Gα subunits reconstituted with receptors plus agonists (4–6-fold increases ink off) (20Senogles S.E. Spiegel A.M. Padrell E. Iyengar R.I. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 4507-4514Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This finding suggests that Pcp2 could mimic a receptor by stimulating GDP release. A family of proteins that promote nucleotide exchange have been described for monomeric G proteins such as Ras (21Shou C. Farnsworth C.L. Neel B.G. Feig L.A. Nature. 1992; 358: 351-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar), but only neuromodulin has been shown to affect nucleotide binding to Gαo. This mechanism of activation is likely to be distinct from Pcp2 because neuromodulin stimulates GTPγS binding through its N-terminal domain, which is homologous to the cytoplasmic tail of G protein-coupled receptors (7Strittmatter S.M. Valenzuela D. Kennedy T.E. Neer E.J. Fishman M.C.

There is no significant difference in any values except ink off for Gαo + Pcp2 versusGαo alone or Gαo + GST (p < 0.006). The gene for Pcp2 is located on mouse chromosome 8 and encodes a cytosolic 99-amino acid protein without significant homology to other proteins (including G protein-coupled receptors). There is some amino acid sequence similarity to the c-sis/PDGF2 gene, but the implications of this are unknown (22Oberdick J. Levinthal F. Levinthal C. Neuron. 1988; 1: 367-376Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The expression profile of Pcp2 is consistent with a role in Purkinje cell development (23Vandaele S. Nordquist D.T. Feddersen R.M. Tretjakoff I. Peterson A.C. Orr H.T. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1136-1148Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), but in mice without Pcp2 expression, Purkinje cells develop normally (presumably through other compensatory mechanisms) (24Mohn A.R. Feddersen R.M. Nguyen M.S. Koller B.H. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 1997; 9: 63-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 25Vassileva G. Smeyne R.J. Morgan J.I. Mol. Brain Res. 1997; 46: 333-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The function of Pcp2 and the mechanism(s) for increased Purkinje cell apoptosis in pcd mice remains unknown. Several genes inpcd mice have altered expression patterns including up-regulation of the early response genes fos andjun and down-regulation of the anti-apoptosis genebcl-2 (26Gillardon F. Baurle J. Wickert H. Grusser-Cornehls U. Zimmermann M. J. Neurosci. Res. 1995; 41: 708-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Several G protein α subunits trigger apoptosis (27Althoefer H. Eversole-Cire P. Simon M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24380-24386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), and Gαo may be involved in apoptosis triggered by a mutated amyloid precursor protein in Alzheimer's disease (28Yamatsuji T. Matsui T. Okamoto T. Komatsuzaki K. Takeda S. Fukumoto H. Iwatsubo T. Suzuki N. Asami-Odaka A. Ireland S. Kinane T.B. Giambarella U. Nishimoto I. Science. 1996; 272: 1349-1352Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). The results described in these studies suggest that Pcp2 may be involved in a signal transduction pathway involving Gαo, but it remains to be determined whether this pathway relates to apoptosis. In addition, our results do not exclude important interactions of Pcp2 with other Gα subunits, particularly Gαi1, which is highly expressed in the brain. Increasingly, novel functions (and locations) for G proteins are being identified (such as in the Golgi, in the endoplasmic reticulum, and on intracellular vesicles) where they regulate protein processing and vesicular targeting (29Denker S.P. McCaffery J.M. Palade G.E. Insel P.A. Farquhar M.G. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 1027-1040Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 30Stow J.L. de Almeida J.B. Narula N. Holtzman E. Ercolani L.

Because G protein-coupled transmembrane receptors have not been identified in many of these locations, Gα subunits may be activated by nucleotide exchange factors. Pcp2 may be such a factor for Gαo in cerebellar Purkinje cells, and future studies will define the functional consequences of this interaction."

Pigs are an appropriate donor source, because their organs have similar physiology and size to human organs, they can be bred in large numbers, and they are relatively free of pathogens capable of causing infection in humans. However, porcine xenografts transplanted into primate recipients undergo hyperacute rejection within minutes to hours of engraftment. The process is mediated by host complement and preformed IgM antibodies directed against Gal α(1,3)Gal epitopes present in various cell surface structures on porcine endothelium (1Galili U.

In contrast to pigs, humans and Old World monkeys do not express Gal α(1,3)Gal in their tissues, because the gene encoding the α(1,3)-galactosyltransferase, which links a terminal galactose residue to Gal β(1,4)GlcNAc oligosaccharide backbone structures, is inactive in these species (7Galili U.

Anti-Gal α(1,3)Gal antibodies develop in humans and higher primates within the first months of life, in parallel with the colonization of the gastrointestinal tract with bacteria containing α(1,3)-linked galactose residues in their cell walls (9Galili U.

Consequently, there exists a window period in which these IgM antibodies are not present in neonatal primates (11Xu H. Edwards N.M. Kwiatkowski P.A. Rosenberg S.E. Michler R.E. Transplantation. 1995; 59: 1189-1194Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar).

Because similar findings have been demonstrated in guinea pig-to-rat cardiac xenotransplantation in which the recipients were treated with cobra venom factor to inactivate the host complement system (18Blakely M.L.

Transplantation. 1994; 58: 1059-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar), these observations suggest that a T cell-independent delayed rejection process, mediated largely by NK cells, occurs in widely disparate transplant combinations, including pig to primate. NK cell lysis is regulated by a balance of intracellular signals transmitted via stimulatory and inhibitory cell surface receptors after specific binding to their respective target cell ligands (19Yokoyama W.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3081-3085Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar,20Gumperz J.E. Parham P. Nature. 1995; 378: 245-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Inhibitory receptors on NK cells have carbohydrate binding domains with specificity for target cell glycoprotein ligands encoded by certain major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I genes (21Daniels B.F.

Stimulatory receptors on NK cells also have carbohydrate binding domains within C-type lectin structures; however, their target cell glycoprotein ligands have not been well-defined (23Bezouska K.

Recent evidence suggests that NK cells and a subset of B cells may belong to an innate immunological system designed to combat frequently encountered carbohydrate antigens, such as those in the cell walls of bacterial pathogens (25Mond J.J.

Carbohydrate antigens can induce T cell-independent B cell antibody responses and can directly stimulate NK cells, without previous antigen sensitization or MHC restriction, to initiate lysis and to produce IFN-γ.

Because the T cell-independent process of delayed xenograft rejection involves NK cells and IgG antibodies, and the principal antigen on porcine endothelium recognized by xenoreactive human antibodies is the carbohydrate epitope Gal α(1,3)Gal, we addressed the possibility that receptors on human NK cells may also react with ligands containing terminal Gal α(1,3)Gal residues, leading to augmented natural cytotoxicity as well as IgG humoral activity against porcine endothelium. Fresh pig aortas were treated for 1 h with 0.5% collagenase (Type IV, Sigma), lightly washed with Hanks' solution, and gently raked with a plastic cell scraper. The liberated endothelial cells were added to tissue culture vessels in RPMI 1640 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.) and 1% penicillin-streptomycin (Life Technologies). The cells were grown to confluence and then transferred to T25 flasks (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ) in fresh medium. HUVECs were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD; cell line CRL-1730), transferred to T25 flasks with fresh medium, and grown to confluence. COS-7 cells were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (cell line CRL-1651), transferred to T25 flasks, and grown to confluence. All cells were used between the third and seventh passages. Human PBMCs were isolated from heparinized whole blood using Isopaque-Ficoll (Gallard Schlesinger Co., Carle Place, NY) and suspended at a concentration of 2.5 × 106cells/ml in augmented RPMI 1640 medium. Depending on the assay condition, the cells were cultured for 12–14 h with or without the addition of 1000 units/ml recombinant human interleukin 2 (IL-2; Peprotech, Rocky Hill, NJ) before being used in functional assays. PBMCs were suspended at a concentration of 2.0 × 106 cells/ml in phosphate-buffered saline (Life Technologies) with 1% bovine serum albumin (Life Technologies). A mixture of magnetic beads conjugated with antibody directed against T cells (CD3), B cells (CD19), and monocytes (CD14) (Dynal, Inc., Lake Success, NY) was added to the cell suspension (at a ratio of 10 beads/cell) and electronically stirred for 60 min at 4 °C. The Magnet Particle Concentrator (MPC-1, Dynal) was used to isolate the beads containing CD3-, CD19-, and CD14-positive cells. The suspension was collected, washed, and stained for the presence of CD56- and CD16-positive cells. This technique reliably isolated a population of cells that was >80–85% NK cells (CD56+, CD16+) with <1–3% contamination with T cells (CD3+). NK cells were resuspended at a concentration of 2.5 × 106 cells/ml in RPMI 1640 medium and cultured for 12–14 h with or without the addition of 1000 units/ml recombinant human IL-2 before being used in functional assays. Details of the cytotoxicity assay have been extensively described elsewhere (31Coligan J.E. Kruisbeck A.M. Margulies D.H. Shevach E.M. Strober W. Current Protocols in Immunology. John Wiley & Sons, New York1994Google Scholar). Briefly, target cells (2 × 104 cells/well) were seeded in flat bottom 96-well plates (Becton Dickinson) and grown to confluence at 37 °C and 5% CO2 overnight. The monolayers were washed with Hanks' solution (Life Technologies, Inc.), labeled with 51Cr (2–4 μCi/well, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 60 min, and then extensively washed before being used in functional assays. Effector cells were added at the desired effector:target ratio, typically 20:1 for assays using PBMCs and 10:1 for assays using purified NK cells, and brought to a final volume of 200 μl/well. After incubation for 4 h, 100 μl of supernatant was collected, and 51Cr was measured in a gamma counter (Clinigamma 1272; Wallac Inc., Gaithersburg, MD). Data are presented as percent specific lysis or percent inhibition of lysis. Percent specific lysis was calculated using the formula (experimental cpm − spontaneous cpm)/(maximum cpm − spontaneous cpm) × 100; where maximum cpm was determined by adding 10% Triton X-100 (Sigma). Percent inhibition of lysis was calculated using the formula 100 × (% lysis observed with control condition − % lysis observed for each experimental condition)/% lysis observed with control condition. All assays were done in triplicate with a minimum of three donors. Results are presented as the mean ± S.E. 51Cr-Labeled PAEC monolayers were treated with the plant isolectin b4 (IB4 Sigma) isolated fromBandeiraea (Griffonia) simplicifolia at concentrations of 2.0, 20, and 200 μg/ml for 60 min at 37 °C and 5% CO2. The monolayers were washed in Hanks' solution and used in a standard lytic assay. Porcine endothelium was treated with α-galactosidase at concentrations shown to reduce antibody-directed complement lysis of porcine endothelium (32Watier H. Guillaumin J.M. Piller F. Lacord M. Thibault G. Lebranchhu Y. Monsigny M. Bardos P. Transplantation. 1996; 62: 105-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Briefly, PAEC monolayers were treated with either α-galactosidase isolated from the Green coffee been (Sigma) or β-galactosidase isolated from Escherichia coli bacteria (Sigma) for 4 h at pH 6.0 or 7.3, respectively. The monolayers were then extensively washed with Hanks' solution and labeled with51Cr and used in standard NK lytic assays. Treatment of the porcine endothelium with α-galactosidase was specific for Gal α(1,3)Gal epitopes and did not affect other carbohydrate epitopes (data not shown). Furthermore, treatment with β-galactosidase did not remove Gal α(1,3)Gal epitopes or other carbohydrate epitopes serving as an appropriate negative control. All oligosaccharide derivatives were obtained from Dextra Laboratories (Reading, UK). Purified NK cells were incubated with a 10−5m concentration of each oligosaccharide derivative at 37 °C for 60 min before being used in standard lytic assays. COS-7 cells were grown to confluence in RPMI 1640 medium. Details of the CDM8 plasmid containing the murine α(1,3)-galactosyltransferase gene have been previously described (4Sandrin M.S. Vaughan H.A. Dabkowski P.L. McKenzie I.F.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11391-11395Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar). Briefly, vector DNA (7–10 μg/1 × 106 targeted cells) was added to Optimem culture medium (Life Technologies) with 5% LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies) and brought to a final concentration of 5–10 μg/ml. The DNA was incubated for 20 min at room temperature and then diluted to a final volume of 7–10 ml. The transfection media were added to 1 × 106 COS cells and incubated overnight at 37 °C with 5% CO2. The following morning the transfection media were aspirated, and the cells were cultured for 48 h before use. The porcine endothelial cell line was cotransfected with the pig α(1,2)-fucosyltransferase cDNA in the expression vector pCDNA-1 (pHT plasmid; Ref. 33Cohney S. Mouhtouris E. McKenzie I.F.C. Sandrin M.S. Immunogenetics. 1996; 44: 76-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) and the pcDNA-1-neo plasmid (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) using a standard calcium phosphate technique with 20 μg of pHT plasmid and 1 μg of pcDNA-1-neo plasmid. Cells were selected for stable integration of transfected DNA by selection in media containing G418, cloned using limiting dilution, and maintained in media containing G418. 5 × 105 of appropriate target cells were washed and resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline with 0.1% bovine serum albumin. Fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated lectin (2 μg/ml), IB4, or Ulex europaeus agglutinin, type I (Sigma) was added to each cell suspension and incubated for 45 min at 4 °C. The cells were washed and fixed in 1% paraformaldehyde (Sigma). Mean channel fluorescence was measured in a FACScan flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson). Two endothelial cell lines with opposing α(1,3)-galactosyltransferase activities and surface expression of terminal Gal α(1,3)Gal residues were selected as initial targets for lysis by human NK cells: PAECs and HUVECs (Fig.1 a). Human NK lysis of xenogeneic porcine endothelium was >2-fold greater than that of allogeneic human endothelium (Fig. 1 b), consistent with the possibility that expression of Gal α(1,3)Gal increases susceptibility of xenogeneic endothelium to lysis by human NK cells. To more directly examine the role of the terminal Gal α(1,3)Gal structure in the heightened susceptibility of xenogeneic porcine endothelium to human NK lysis, inhibition experiments were performed using the plant lectin IB4, which specifically binds to this structure (34Hayes C.E. Goldstein I.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 1904-1914Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). NK lysis of porcine endothelium was markedly reduced in the presence of IB4 in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig.1 c). The next set of experiments sought to identify the terminal α(1,3)-linked galactose residue within the Gal α(1,3)Gal structure as an essential component of porcine ligands involved in triggering human NK cell lysis. Enzymatic treatment of porcine endothelium with α-galactosidase reduced NK lysis in a concentration-dependent manner, which correlated with the level of reduced Gal α(1,3)Gal expression (Fig. 1, d ande). At the highest concentration of α-galactosidase used, 20 units/ml, NK lysis was inhibited by a mean of 35% accompanying a 44% reduction in cell surface expression of Gal α(1,3)Gal. This inhibition of NK lysis was specific to cleavage of terminal α(1,3)-linked galactose residues, because enzymatic treatment with β-galactosidase had no effect (Fig. 1 f). To directly demonstrate the effect of surface expression of α(1,3)-linked galactose residues on susceptibility to NK lysis, COS cells were transfected with the murine α(1,3)-galactosyltransferase gene (Fig.2 a). These cells do not normally express Gal α(1,3)Gal epitopes and acquire susceptibility to complement-mediated lysis in the presence of human serum after transfection with α(1,3)-galactosyltransferase (4Sandrin M.S. Vaughan H.A. Dabkowski P.L. McKenzie I.F.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11391-11395Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar). In the present study, COS cells transfected with α(1,3)-galactosyltransferase, but not the vector alone, showed increased susceptibility to lysis by human NK cells at every effector:target ratio tested (Fig. 2 b). A recent study using similarly transfected COS cells demonstrated enhanced adhesion of human NK cells to COS cells expressing Gal α(1,3)Gal (35Inverardi L. Clissi B. Stolzer A.L. Bender J.R. Sandrin M.S. Pardi R. Transplantation. 1997; 63: 318-330Crossref Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Our results extend these observations and show that the increased binding of NK cells to terminal Gal α(1,3)Gal residues expressed by ligands on cells transfected with α(1,3)-galactosyltransferase leads to activation of NK cell stimulatory receptors and causes increased target cell lysis. Moreover, because augmented NK lysis of α(1,3)-galactosyltransferase transfected cells was observed for both NK cells at rest and after cytokine activation (Fig. 2 c), these findings suggest that the stimulatory NK cell receptors that bind ligands containing Gal α(1,3)Gal are constitutively expressed. Transfection of porcine endothelium with the gene encoding the α(1,2)-fucosyltransferase enzyme has been shown to reduce the level of Gal α(1,3)Gal expression (36Sandrin M.S. Fodor W.L. Mouhtouris E. Osman N. Cohney S. Rollins S. Guilmette E.R. Setter E. Squinto S.P. McKenzie I.F.C. Nat. Med. 1995; 12: 1261-1267Crossref Scopus (283) Google Scholar). The α(1,2)-fucosyltransferase competes with α(1,3)-galactosyltransferase for the acceptor substrate Gal β(1,4)GlcNAc and diverts synthesis of Gal α(1,3)Gal β(1,4)GlcNAc to Fuc α(1,2)Gal β(1,4)GlcNAc (“H substance” or blood type O phenotype). To compare the effect of terminal Gal α(1,3)Gal or Fuc α(1,2)Gal residues on NK lysis of porcine endothelium, human NK cells were incubated with two pairs of soluble oligosaccharides, each pair consisting of the tetrasaccharide backbone and its appropriate derivative after glycosyltransferase catalysis (Fig.3, a–d). The type I tetrasaccharide lacto-N-tetra inhibited NK lysis by 2.1-fold higher levels than the type II tetrasaccharide lacto-N-neo-tetra (Fig. 3 e), suggesting that carbohydrate binding structures on human NK cells may have a preference for ligands containing type I structures. Addition of a terminal Gal α(1,3)Gal residue inhibited specific NK lysis of porcine endothelium by 3.3-fold higher levels than the lacto-N-neo-tetra backbone structure (Fig. 3 e), consistent with our previous data that ligands containing Gal α(1,3)Gal are bound by receptors on human NK cells. The addition of a terminal Fuc α(1,2)Gal residue also increased inhibition of NK lysis of porcine endothelium by levels 2.5-fold higher than the lacto-N-tetra backbone structure (Fig. 3 e). Thus, human NK cells can bind both Gal α(1,3)Gal and Fuc α(1,2)Gal residues. To investigate the effect of cell surface carbohydrate remodeling on susceptibility to human NK lysis, porcine endothelial cells were transfected with α(1,2)-fucosyltransferase cDNA, and lines were derived that demonstrated stable expression but widely divergent levels of the H substance (Fig. 4, aandb). Surface expression of Gal α(1,3)Gal β(1,4)Glc was inversely proportional to that of Fuc α(1,2)Gal β(1,4)Glc, reflecting the degree of competition for Gal β(1,4)Glc substrate by the glycosyltransferases. Reduction in surface expression of Gal α(1,3)Gal significantly reduced susceptibility of porcine endothelial cells to lysis by human NK cells (Fig. 4 c). Although lytic susceptibility decreased in direct parallel with reduction in surface levels of Gal α(1,3)Gal, human NK lysis could not be reduced by >55% even with >80% reduction of Gal α(1,3)Gal expression. This level of human NK lysis approaches that seen with allogeneic endothelium. Because the process of delayed xenograft rejection involves NK cells and inducible IgG antibodies, we addressed the possibility that human NK cells may also react with ligands containing terminal Gal α(1,3)Gal residues—the principal antigen on porcine endothelium recognized by xenoreactive antibodies. Enzymatic treatment of porcine endothelium with α-galactosidase reduced human NK lysis of porcine endothelium, which specifically correlated with the level of Gal α(1,3)Gal expression. Furthermore, transfecting a primate cell line with the murine α(1,3)-galactosyltransferase gene increased the susceptibility to lysis by human NK cells, again correlating with the expression of Gal α(1,3)Gal. These results suggest that receptors on human NK cells can directly recognize Gal α(1,3)Gal epitopes on target cells, leading to activation of the NK cell lytic machinery and target cell death. Two transgenic strategies have been proposed to overcome complement-mediated hyperacute rejection of porcine xenografts attributable to preformed IgM antibodies directed against Gal α(1,3)Gal epitopes: 1) protection of porcine endothelium against the effects of human complement by expression of human complement inhibitory proteins (37Fodor W.L. Williams B.L. Matis L.A. Madri J.A Rollins S.A. Knight J.W. Velander W. Squinto S.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11153-11157Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar, 38Rosengard A.M.

Platt J.L. Logan J.S. Transplantation. 1996; 61: 1241-1249Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) and 2) reduction in the level of Gal α(1,3)Gal expression on porcine endothelium by high level expression of the enzyme α(1,2)-fucosyltransferase (36Sandrin M.S. Fodor W.L. Mouhtouris E. Osman N. Cohney S. Rollins S. Guilmette E.R. Setter E. Squinto S.P. McKenzie I.F.C. Nat. Med. 1995; 12: 1261-1267Crossref Scopus (283) Google Scholar). The second strategy is predicated on the knowledge that both α(1,3)-galactosyltransferase and α(1,2)-fucosyltransferase use the same acceptor substrate, Gal β(1,4)GlcNAc, to direct synthesis of Gal α(1,3)Gal β(1,4)GlcNAc and Fuc α(1,2)Gal β(1,4)GlcNAc (H substance or blood type O phenotype), respectively. When both enzymes are cotransfected into COS cells, α(1,2)-fucosyltransferase dominates over α(1,3)-galactosyl transferase so that Gal α(1,3)Gal expression is almost completely suppressed in the presence of Fuc α(1,2)Gal (36Sandrin M.S. Fodor W.L. Mouhtouris E. Osman N. Cohney S. Rollins S. Guilmette E.R. Setter E. Squinto S.P. McKenzie I.F.C. Nat. Med. 1995; 12: 1261-1267Crossref Scopus (283) Google Scholar). This effect is the result of the temporal order of action of these enzymes, with α(1,2)-fucosyltransferase having preferential access to the Gal β(1,4)GlcNAc acceptor substance because of specific amino acid sequences in its cytoplasmic domain, which target its localization to particular compartments within the Golgi apparatus (40Osman N. McKenzie I.F.C. Mouhtouris E. Sandrin M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33105-33109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Using soluble oligosaccharide derivatives to competitively inhibit human NK cell lysis, we found that the addition of a terminal Gal α(1,3)Gal or terminal Fuc α(1,2)Gal residue to their respective carbohydrate derivative further inhibited human NK lysis of porcine endothelium. These results suggest that both Gal α(1,3)Gal and Fuc α(1,2)Gal residues are able to bind human NK cells and raise the possibility that substitution of a terminal α(1,2)-linked fucosyl residue for a terminal α(1,3)-linked galactosyl residue to the Gal β(1,4)Glc backbone structure would not reduce target cell susceptibility to human NK cell lysis. We directly investigated this possibility using porcine endothelial cells that were transfected with α(1,2)-fucosyltransferase cDNA. Reduction in surface expression of Gal α(1,3)Gal significantly reduced susceptibility of porcine endothelial cells to lysis by human NK cells in direct parallel with reduction in surface levels of Gal α(1,3)Gal. However, NK lysis could not be fully eliminated even with almost complete reduction of Gal α(1,3)Gal expression, suggesting that additional factors may contribute to the human NK cell response to porcine endothelium. Possible additional mechanisms include interactions between noncarbohydrate ligands on porcine endothelium and stimulatory receptors on human NK cells and/or incompatibility between swine MHC class I molecules and inhibitory receptors on human NK cells. These data suggest that carbohydrate remodeling of porcine endothelium by high level expression of α(1,2)-fucosyltransferase decreases susceptibility to human NK lysis by two possible mechanisms: 1) a reduction of Gal α(1,3)Gal residues within porcine endothelial cell ligands, which bind to stimulatory receptors on human NK cells; and 2) an increase of Fuc α(1,2)Gal residues within porcine endothelial cell ligands, which bind nonactivating or inhibitory receptors on human NK cells. In both human and murine MHC class I structures, a conservedN-linked glycosylation site is located at Asn-86 (41Parham P. Alpert B.N. Orr H.T. Strominger J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 7555-7567Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), adjacent to residues 74–83 of the α-chain, which encode the polymorphic epitopes recognized by inhibitory NK cell receptors (42Storkus W.J.

Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 1235-1242Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). In humans, the oligosaccharide structures at this site are remarkably uniform among various MHC class I allotypes and generally contain terminal sialic acid residues (45Barber L.D. Patel T.P. Percival L. Gumperz J.E. Lanier L.L. Phillips J.H. Bigge J.C. Wormald M.R. Parekh R.B. Parham P. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 3275-3284PubMed Google Scholar). Because high level endothelial cell expression of α(1,2)-fucosyltransferase reduces terminal sialylation (46Sepp A. Skacel P. Lindstedt R. Lechler R.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23104-23110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 47Shinkel T.A. Chen C.G. Salvaris E. Henion T.R. Barlow H. Galili U. Pearse M.J. D'Apice A.J.F. Transplantation. 1997; 64: 197-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), presumably because of competition with sialytransferases for the lactosamine substrate, it is possible that the substitution of a terminal α(1,2)-linked fucose residue to the oligosaccharide chain at Asn-86 of the swine MHC class I structure may enhance binding of the MHC molecule to human NK cell inhibitory receptors. This possibility is currently the subject of investigation in our laboratory. With the development of transgenic pig organs resistant to complement-mediated hyperacute rejection, the subsequent immunological barrier confronted by these genetically modified xenografts on transplantation into primate recipients will be that comprising NK cells and macrophages. In this report, we have shown that primate NK cells react prominently with the same principal xenoantigen on porcine endothelium that is recognized by naturally occurring xenoreactive antibodies, confirming the relationship between NK cells and B cells within an innate compartment of the immune system that is T cell-independent. High level expression of α(1,2)-fucosyltransferase, which reduces binding of xenoreactive antibodies, protected porcine endothelium against lysis by human NK cells. Because the alternative transgenic strategy for overcoming complement-mediated hyperacute rejection is to induce expression of human complement inhibitory proteins to protect porcine endothelium against the effects of human complement, organs modified in this manner will continue to be susceptible to a process of delayed xenograft rejection mediated by NK cells and induced IgG antibodies reactive with ligands expressing Gal α(1,3)Gal epitopes. Our study suggests that successful transgenic strategies for pig-to-primate xenotransplantation will need to incorporate carbohydrate remodeling to limit xenograft rejection by a T cell-independent cellular and humoral process.

Leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) is a pleiotropic neuroimmune cytokine whose gene expression has been demonstrated in human fetal, adult and murine pituitary cells (10Akita S. Webster J. Ren S.G.

LIF is a component of the interleukin-6 (IL-6) cytokine family, which also includes IL-6, IL-11, ciliary neutrophic factor, oncostatin M, and cardiotrophin-1. Signaling initiated by these cytokines is transduced by activation of composite receptors that share a common transmembrane gp130 protein subunit (12Davis S. Yancopoulos G.D. Curr. Opin.

LIF ligand binding is associated with gp130 and LIF receptor subunit heterodimerization and subsequent activation of downstream tyrosine kinases (17Gearing D.P. Thut C.J. VandenBos T. Gimpel S.D.

Subsequent to LIF receptor dimerization, JAK2 is activated by tyrosine autophosphorylation (19Schindler C. Darnell Jr., J.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 621-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (1645) Google Scholar). These events lead to tyrosine phosphorylation, auto- or hetero-dimerization, and nuclear translocation of STAT3 (signal transducer and activator of transcription) and, to a lesser extent, STAT1α, which regulates immediate-response gene transcription (20Ray D.W. Ren S.G. Melmed S. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 1852-1859Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 21Horvath C.M. Darnell Jr., J.E. Curr. Opin.

In AtT20 murine corticotroph cells, LIF increases POMC mRNA levels and ACTH secretion, and synergizes with corticotropin releasing hormone (CRH) to trigger these effects (20Ray D.W. Ren S.G. Melmed S. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 1852-1859Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Recently, we delineated elements of the POMC promoter important for a component of LIF and CRH synergy on POMC transcription (23Bousquet C. Ray D.W. Melmed S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10551-10557Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). However, identification of a specific LIF-induced transcription factor that activates POMC transcription has been elusive. We have recently shown that overexpression of SOCS-3, a cytokine-inducible signaling inhibitor related to JAB, SSI, or CIS (24Endo T.A. Masuhara M. Yokouchi M. Suzuki R. Sakamoto H. Mitsui K.

Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 954-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). As SOCS-3 was also potently induced by LIF, SOCS-3 was implicated as a negative intracellular regulator of pituitary LIF signaling. SOCS-3 overexpression in corticotroph cells abrogated LIF-induced gp130 and STAT3 phosphorylation, suggesting STAT3 as a critical regulator of pituitary LIF function. Although LIF action occurs mainly through the JAK-STAT pathway, other subcellular signaling pathways are activated by IL-6-related cytokines including phospholipase C, phosphoinositol 3-kinase, phosphotyrosine phosphatase D, pp120, the insulin receptor substrate 1, or several components of the mitogen-activated protein kinases cascade pathway, including SHC, GRB2, Raf-1, ERK1, and ERK2 (27Boulton T.G.

Chem. 1994; 269: 6376-6382Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Activation of these widespread signal transducing molecules implies substantial convergence between cytokine-activated pathways and receptor tyrosine kinase-activated pathways. Nevertheless, JAK proteins appear to be key determinants for this convergence as their disruption results in failure of downstream phosphorylation events (31Schiemann W.P. Bartoe J.L. Nathanson N.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16631-16636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 33Winston L.A. Hunter T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30837-30840Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Furthermore, convergence between both pathways may also occur at the level of STAT proteins. Indeed, activation of Raf-1 by interferon γ and oncostatin M requires expression of the STAT1 transcription factor (34Stancato L.F. Yu C.-R. Petricoin III, E.F. Larner A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18701-18704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) and, reciprocally, ERK2 activity is required for stimulation of interferon α- and β-induced gene expression through STAT proteins (35David M. Petricoin E. Benjamin C. Pine R. Weber M.J. Larner A.C. Science. 1995; 269: 1721-1723Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). To address molecular mechanisms responsible for LIF induction of the neuroendocrine stress response, we tested the involvement of STAT3 or MAPK in this LIF response. Inactivating STAT3 mutants include a phenylalanine substitution at a critical tyrosine carboxyl-terminal residue, Tyr-705 (STAT3F), and a mutant containing two alanine substitutions at positions important for STAT3 DNA binding (Glu-434 and Glu-435) (36Nakajima K. Yamanaka Y. Nakae K. Kojima H. Ichiba M. Kiuchi N. Kitaoka T. Fukada T. Hibi M. Hirano T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3651-3658Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). We therefore isolated stable mutant STAT3 AtT20 transformants and show that they behave as dominant negative inhibitors of endogenous corticotroph cell STAT3. Suppression of STAT3 activity is here shown to abrogate LIF action on POMC transcription and ACTH secretion. However, chemical or molecular blockade of the MAPK pathway did not impact LIF-induced POMC promoter activity. These results thus indicate the key role of STAT3 in the LIF-mediated neuroendocrine pituitary stress response. AtT20 cells, obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD), were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mml-glutamine, 100 units/ml streptomycin, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 0.25 μg/ml amphotericin B (Life Technology, Inc.). To isolate stable transformants expressing wild-type or inactivated Stat3, pCAGGS-Neo-HA-Stat3WT, pCAGGS-Neo-HA-Stat3F, and pCGGS-Neo-HA-Stat3D (36Nakajima K. Yamanaka Y. Nakae K. Kojima H. Ichiba M. Kiuchi N. Kitaoka T. Fukada T. Hibi M. Hirano T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3651-3658Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar) were transfected in AtT20 cells by calcium precipitation and transformants selected with G418 (1 mg/ml). STAT3F presents a substitution of the residue Tyr-705 with a phenylalanine and, STAT3D presents two substitutions of the glutamic acid residues 434 and 435 with two alanine (36Nakajima K. Yamanaka Y. Nakae K. Kojima H. Ichiba M. Kiuchi N. Kitaoka T. Fukada T. Hibi M. Hirano T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3651-3658Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). AtT20 cells were grown in 10-ml dishes to 50% confluence and serum-deprived 16 h before treatment with LIF (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). Cells were then washed once with phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.0), once with lysis buffer (50 mm Hepes, 150 mmNaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 10 mmNa4P2O7, 100 mm NaF, 2 mm sodium orthovanadate, pH 7.4) and lysed in 500 μl of lysis buffer containing 1% Triton X-100 and protease inhibitors (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 μm leupeptin). After a 10-min incubation at 4 °C, the lysate was collected and centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C to remove insoluble material. STAT3 proteins were immunoprecipitated by incubating the solubilized cells for 2 h at 4 °C with a monoclonal anti-hemagglutinin antibody, 12CA5 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) prebound to Sepharose-protein G beads (Sigma) or a polyclonal anti-STAT3 antibody (Santa Cruz) prebound to Sepharose A beads (Sigma). Immune complexes were collected by centrifugation, washed twice with a buffer containing 30 mm Hepes, 30 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Triton X-100, pH 7.4, and boiled for 3 min in 40 μl of SDS-sample buffer. Samples were separated on 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and electroblotted on polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The membrane was blocked for 16 h at 4 °C in 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 500 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20 supplemented with 3% bovine serum albumin, blotted for 3 h at room temperature with polyclonal anti-STAT3 or monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies (Santa Cruz). Bound antibodies were detected with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG followed by ECL detection (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Whole cell extracts (20 μg) were preincubated in a final volume of 20 μl (10 mmHepes, pH 7.9, 80 mm NaCl, 10 mm glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA) with 2 μg of poly(dI-dC)-poly(dI-dC) at room temperature for 15 min. A32P-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotide SIE67 used as probe (40,000 cpm, 5 fmol/reaction) was then added for 20 min at room temperature. In competition experiments, 100-fold molar excess unlabeled competitor oligonucleotides were added to the preincubation reaction. For supershift experiments, extracts were preincubated with 2 μg of polyclonal STAT3 antibody (Santa Cruz) for 1 h at 4 °C. Protein-DNA complexes were resolved on a 6% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel containing 2.5% glycerol in 0.5× Tris borate/EDTA at 4 °C, dried, and autoradiographed. Nucleotide sequences for SIE and AP-1 are: SIE, 5′-cgcgTcATTTcccgTAAATcA-3′; AP-1, 5′-cgcTT- gATgAgTcAgccggAA-3′. AtT20 cells were plated in 2-ml dishes (100,000 cells/well) and allowed to adhere for 16 h. Cells were transfected as described (20Ray D.W. Ren S.G. Melmed S. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 1852-1859Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) with 0.5 μg per dish of rat POMC promoter (−706/+64) fused to a luciferase reporter, and 0.5 μg of pSV-lacZ (Promega) expressing the β-galactosidase protein as an internal transfection control. In the cotransfection experiments using the dominant negative form of MAPK cDNA, various concentrations of the cDNA were also coexpressed. 24 h after transfection, cells were treated in triplicate for 7 h, washed once in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7, lysed in reporter lysis buffer, and subjected to assay for luciferase (20Ray D.W. Ren S.G. Melmed S. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 1852-1859Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) or β-galactosidase activity (Promega). Total RNA from AtT20 cells transfected with either STAT3wt, F, or D and treated with or without 0.5 nm LIF for 24 h, was prepared using Trizol reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). 10 μg of RNA/lane was size-fractionated under denaturing conditions using formaldehyde-agarose (1.2%) gel, transferred to nitrocellulose, and hybridized with a32P-labeled probe POMC probe (2.5 × 106cpm/2 ml hybridization solution) (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer. ACTH was measured by a radioimmunoassay kit purchased from Diagnostic Products Corp. (Los Angeles, CA). The IL-6 family of cytokines activate the JAK-STAT pathway in several systems, and LIF is a powerful activator of the JAK-STAT pathway, in particular, in AtT20 cells. We therefore isolated pituicyte transformants stably expressing wild-type or dominant negative forms of STAT3 to test whether STAT3 mediates LIF induction of corticotroph function in these cells. Plasmids encoding hemagglutinin peptide (HA)-tagged STAT3F (HA-STAT3F) and HA-tagged STAT3D (HA-STAT3D) as well as HA-tagged wild-type STAT3 (HA-STAT3wt) were introduced into AtT20 murine corticotroph pituitary cells. These cells have been shown to be an excellent model for studying the role of cytokine action in the ACTH stress response (20Ray D.W. Ren S.G. Melmed S. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 1852-1859Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 23Bousquet C. Ray D.W. Melmed S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10551-10557Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Several different clones selected by G-418 resistance were established; each expressed HA-STAT3F, HA-STAT3D, or HA-STAT3wt. Expression levels of transfected STAT3F or D mutants or STAT3wt, respectively, were determined by immunoprecipitation of HA-STAT3 with anti-HA monoclonal antibody (12CA5) followed by immunoblot analysis with polyclonal anti-STAT3 antibody (Fig. 1). Three independent clones for STAT3wt transformants (clones 1, 2, and 3) and for each dominant negative form of STAT3F (clones 2, 4, and 5) or STAT3D (clones 2, 4, and 6), respectively, were selected. Each clone was shown to express similar levels of HA-STAT3 protein and was used in the ensuing experiments. To confirm the dominant negative action of HA-STAT3F on endogenous STAT3 function, cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with STAT3 antibody, followed by immunoblotting with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (Fig. 2 A). This Western blot showed the inability of both endogenous STAT3 and exogenous HA-STAT3F to be phosphorylated after 1 nm LIF treatment for 5 or 10 min in the HA-STAT3F transfected clones. However, in the HA-STAT3wt or HA-STAT3D transfected clones, similar LIF treatments enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3, as expected. These results indicated that HA-STAT3F protein behaves in a dominant negative manner by blocking LIF-induced endogenous STAT3 phosphorylation. To confirm the dominant negative inactivating action of HA-STAT3D, DNA binding was tested by probing with the STAT inducible element (SIEm67) contained within the c-fos promoter. This element is readily recognized by either STAT1 or STAT3 (35David M. Petricoin E. Benjamin C. Pine R. Weber M.J. Larner A.C. Science. 1995; 269: 1721-1723Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). After electrophoretic mobility shift assay with extracts derived from mock-transfected AtT20 cells treated for 15 min with 1 nm LIF, three specific complexes were visualized and were effectively competed by 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled SIE probe, but not by an exogenous double-stranded oligonucleotide (Fig. 2 B). These three complexes correspond to the previously described SIF (Sis-inducible factor) A (STAT3 homodimer), SIF B (STAT1/STAT3 heterodimer), and SIF C (STAT1 homodimer) (19Schindler C. Darnell Jr., J.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 621-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (1645) Google Scholar, 21Horvath C.M. Darnell Jr., J.E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 233-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). In the HA-STAT3wt transfected clone, 15 min of 1 nm LIF treatment induced the formation of a single specific complex. STAT3 was shown to be a component of this complex as addition of STAT3 antibody to cell extracts, prior to addition of the SIE probe, inhibited complex formation and induced a faint supershift. However, in the HA-STAT3D transfected clones, this complex was clearly not induced by LIF treatment. This abrogation of DNA binding demonstrated the dominant negative action of HA-STAT3D on endogenous STAT3 action in the HA-STAT3D transfected clones. As LIF activates rat POMC expression through the −706/+64 region of the POMC promoter (20Ray D.W. Ren S.G. Melmed S. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 1852-1859Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), activity of this promoter was tested in the STAT3 dominant negative clones. Transient transfections of a POMC promoter-driven luciferase reporter, as well as of a vector encoding β-galactosidase (internal control), were performed in mock-transfected AtT20, and HA-STAT3wt, F, and D clones, respectively (Fig. 3 A). Treatment with 1 nm LIF for 6 h of mock-transfected AtT20 caused a 4.5 ± 0.4-fold (p < 0.01) luciferase induction. Furthermore, similar LIF treatment of the HA-STAT3wt clones enhanced (p < 0.05,versus mock-transfected) this induction to 7.7 ± 0.8-fold. However, in the HA-STAT3F and D clones, LIF induction was significantly abrogated (p < 0.01) as compared with mock-transfected AtT20 or HA-STAT3wt. Indeed, the HA-STAT3F clones only showed 1.81 ± 0.1-fold induction (p < 0.01), and 2.55 ± 0.2-fold induction (p < 0.01) was observed in the HA-STAT3D clones. These results indicated the requirement for STAT3 in mediating LIF induction of POMC expression at the transcriptional level. To confirm that the HA-STAT3F and D clones were functionally viable, and yet failed to respond specifically to LIF because of lack of inducible STAT3, cells were also treated with dibutyryl cAMP, which stimulates POMC expression through an AP-1 like element in the first exon of the POMC gene (37Boutillier A.L. Gaiddon C. Lorang D. Roberts J.L. Loeffler J.P. Pituitary. 1998; 1: 33-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), and whose recognition motif is also present within the POMC promoter fragment (−706/+64) (Fig. 3 B). 5 mm dibutyryl cAMP treatment for 6 h similarly stimulated POMC transcription in both mock-transfected AtT20 cells (4.1 ± 0.2), and in the HA-STAT3wt clones (4.3 ± 0.1) as well as in the mutant HA-STAT3F and D clones (3.9 ± 0.2 and 4 ± 0.2, respectively). This result indicated that, although the STAT3 pathway was specifically altered in the HA-STAT3F and D clones, cAMP known to induce POMC expression through alternate STAT3-independent transduction signals was still functionally operative in these cells. To test the in vivo significance of the preceding results, POMC Northern blots were also performed on mRNA extracted from HA-STAT3wt, F, or D clones stimulated with 1 nm LIF for 24 h (Fig.4). As expected, LIF treatment for 24 h in HA-STAT3wt clones enhanced POMC mRNA expression (2.24 ± 0.21-fold induction) (Fig. 4 C). This induction was observed within 3 h of treatment (Fig. 4 A) and was maximal after 24 h. This time point was also utilized to compare LIF effects in wild-type and dominant negative STAT3 clones (Fig. 4,B and C). In HA-STAT3F and D clones, induction of POMC mRNA expression was decreased, respectively, to 1.42-fold ± 0.07 (p < 0.01) and to 1.59-fold ± 0.16 (p < 0.02) versus HA-STAT3wt. These results thus confirmed the in vivo importance of STAT3 in transducing neuroendocrine LIF signaling to endogenous POMC. The physiologic relevance of STAT3 disruption in the HA-STAT3 clones was also assessed by measuring ACTH levels in conditioned medium after 24 h treatment with 1 nm LIF (Fig. 5). In mock-transfected AtT20 cells as well as in HA-STAT3 wt clones, LIF stimulated ACTH basal levels 2.4 ± 0.2-fold and 2.7 ± 0.1-fold, respectively. However, in HA-STAT3F and D dominant negative clones, this induction was attenuated (respectively, 2 ± 0.08 and 1.9 ± 0.09) (p < 0.01) in comparison to both mock-transfected AtT20 cells and HA-STAT3wt clones. The IL-6 cytokine family, which transduces through the gp130 subunit, may also activate Ras-MAPK pathways (27Boulton T.G. Stahl N. Yancopoulos G.D. J. Biol.

Using LIF-activated AtT20 cell extracts in a Western blotting experiment using an anti-tyrosine-phosphorylated form of MAPK antibody, treatment for 10 min with 1 nm LIF was shown to induce MAPK phosphorylation 2-fold (data not shown). To test whether the Ras-MAPK pathway might be a functional component of LIF function in AtT20 cells, we blocked MAPK by either using a chemical inhibitor of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MAPKK), PD 98059, which inhibits MAPK activation and subsequent phosphorylation of MAPK substrates, or, a cDNA encoding a dominant negative form of MAPK (TAYF). Pretreatment of AtT20 cells for 1 h with PD 98059 (5–100 μm) did not affect either LIF-induced POMC promoter activity (TableI) or LIF-induced STAT3 binding to the SIE probe (data not shown). Cotransfection of various concentrations of a dominant negative form of MAPK (T183A/Y185F) with the POMC promoter luciferase construct also did not alter LIF-induced POMC promoter activity (Table II). Thus, MAPK does not appear to be implicated in LIF corticotroph function despite the weak induction of ERK2 tyrosine phosphorylation by LIF in these cells.Table IBlockade of MAPK pathway does not alter LIF-induced POMC promoter activityEffects of PD98058 on LIF-induced POMC transcription1All effects are nonsignificant.μm-fold induction05.95 ± 0.9556.07 ± 0.86PD 98058105.97 ± 0.86206.97 ± 0.63507.27 ± 0.441007.77 ± 0.84Rat POMC promoter-luciferase transiently transfected AtT20 cells were pretreated for 1 h with 0–100 μm PD 98059, and subsequently treated for 6 h with 1 nm LIF.

https://openalex.org/W2068123718,"We have cloned from rat brain a family of alternatively spliced cDNAs from a single gene, which encodes a norepinephrine transporter (NET) having variations at the 3′-region including both coding and noncoding regions. This produces two transporter isoforms, rNETa and rNETb, which differ at their COOH termini. The rNETa isoform reveals a COOH terminus homologous to human NET and transports norepinephrine. In contrast, rNETb revealed no detectable transport function but reduced functional expression of rNETa when both isoforms were expressed in the same cell. Thus, rNETb potentially functions as a dominant negative inhibitor of rNETa activity. Co-expression of rNETb with a γ-aminobutyric acid transporter (rGAT1), a serotonin transporter (rSERT), and a dopamine transporter (rDAT) reduced their transport activity. No reduction was found with the glutamate/aspartate transporter (rGLAST). Alternative RNA splicing of NET suggests a novel mechanism for the regulation of synaptic transmission.

In contrast, rNETb revealed no detectable transport function but reduced functional expression of rNETa when both isoforms were expressed in the same cell. Thus, rNETb potentially functions as a dominant negative inhibitor of rNETa activity. Co-expression of rNETb with a γ-aminobutyric acid transporter (rGAT1), a serotonin transporter (rSERT), and a dopamine transporter (rDAT) reduced their transport activity. No reduction was found with the glutamate/aspartate transporter (rGLAST). Alternative RNA splicing of NET suggests a novel mechanism for the regulation of synaptic transmission. The norepinephrine transporter (NET) 1The abbreviations used are: NET, norepinephrine transporter; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA ends; DAT, dopamine transporter; SERT, serotonin transporter; GAT, GABA transporter; GLAST, glutamate/aspartate transporter; kb, kilobase(s); GABA, γ-aminobutyric acid. at presynaptic nerve terminals mediates the uptake of released norepinephrine, resulting in the rapid termination of synaptic transmission and thereby controlling the fine tuning of neuronal activities. Psychostimulants, including amphetamines, and tricyclic antidepressants, such as desipramine, exert their pharmacological effects by acting on NET (1Iversen L.L. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1971; 41: 571-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar, 2Langer Z.S. Schoemaker H. Prog. Neuropsychopharmacol. Biol. Psychiatry. 1988; 12: 193-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Molecular cloning studies have resulted in the isolation of human NET cDNA (3Pacholczyk T. Blakely D.R. Amara G.S. Nature. 1991; 350: 350-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (760) Google Scholar), followed by several other monoamine neurotransmitter transporters from several species (4Amara S.G. Pacholczyk T. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1991; 1: 84-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 5Uhl G.R. Trends Neurosci. 1992; 15: 265-268Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). There is a line of evidence suggesting that functional expression of monoamine neurotransmitter transporters is regulated in different ways, e.g. direct or indirect protein phosphorylation, long term modification at the level of mRNA expression, translation, and processing (4Amara S.G. Pacholczyk T. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1991; 1: 84-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 5Uhl G.R.

Recently, gene targeting of these transporters by homologous recombination was utilized to investigate their physiological relevance in vivo. Elimination of the dopamine transporter (DAT) in knockout mice produces hyperlocomotion and indifference to cocaine and amphetamines (7Giros B. Jaber M. Jones S.R. Wightman R.M. Caron M.G. Nature. 1996; 379: 606-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (2071) Google Scholar). The regulatory importance of alternative RNA splicing has been suggested in many genes, including members of the γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA)/norepinephrine transporter family. In the glycine transporter GLYT1, alternative splicing of 5′-noncoding and -coding sequences confers differential cell-specific expression of GLYT1 gene products (8Borowsky B. Mezey E. Hoffman B.J. Neuron. 1993; 10: 851-863Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Two different cDNAs of bovine NET, which display different COOH termini, have been reported (9Lingen B. Bruess M. Boenisch H. FEBS Lett. 1994; 342: 235-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 10Jursky F. Tamura S. Tamura A. Mandiyan S. Nelson H. Nelson N. J. Exp. Biol. 1994; 196: 283-295Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Based on the analysis of human and mouse NET genes at the exon-intron boundary for this 3′-region (11Porzgen P. Bonisch H. Bruss M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 215: 1145-1150Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 12Fritz J.D. Jayanthi L.D. Thoreson M.A. Blakely R.D. J. Neurochem. 1998; 70: 2241-2251Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), it is suggested that the difference may occur from alternative splicing. To gain further understanding of the importance of these transporters in monoaminergic nervous system functions, we isolated and characterized cDNAs encoding rat NET that displayed RNA splice variants at the 3′-region including both coding and noncoding regions. One splice form, which codes different predicted COOH-terminal amino acid sequences, revealed no detectable transport function. However, it reduced functional expression of another splice variant having a homologous COOH terminus to human NET. Double-stranded cDNAs from rat brain (Sprague-Dawley males, ages 10–12 weeks) ligated to the adaptor (Marathon ReadyTM cDNA,CLONTECH) were used to perform the polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) (13Frohman M.A. Dush M.K. Martin G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8998-9002Crossref PubMed Scopus (4336) Google Scholar) for cloning of 5′- and 3′-cDNAs encoding rat NET. The primers used were based on the following sequences of partial rat NET cDNAs (14Ramachandran B. Houben K. Rozenberg Y.Y. Haigh J.R. Varpetian A. Howard B.D. J. Biol.

PCR conditions were: 5 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 74 °C for 4 min, 5 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 4 min, and 30 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 68 °C for 4 min. PCR reaction mixtures were purified and subjected to a second PCR with the nested primers: 5′-GTCAATGTGCAGGTAGGCGTTGATGCC for nested 5′-RACE and 5′-TCTGGGGCTAGATAGCTCAATGGGAGG for nested 3′-RACE. PCR products were isolated from agarose gels and cloned into pGEM-T or pGEM-T Easy (Promega), and colony PCR was performed for selection of positive clones. The resulting cDNAs of positive clones were sequenced. Full-length cDNA for rat NET was cloned by PCR with reverse transcribed mRNA from rat brain (Sprague-Dawley male, age 4 weeks) or PC12 cells using pSuperscript II (LifeTech). The primers used were 5′-CTGAATTCGGTGTGTCCCCAGTGCCTCCGAAGTC and 5′-ATGCGGCCGCGAATGATACTTGAACAGTCTGTGACA. PCR conditions were 94 °C for 2 min, 35 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 68 °C for 4 min, and 68 °C for 10 min. The resulting cDNA was cloned into pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) and completely sequenced on both strands using the dideoxynucleotide chain termination method. The rNET gene coding the 3′-region of rNET that produces alternative spliced isoforms was isolated by PCR with the primers (P1 and R6, Fig. 1 A), cloned into pGEM-T Easy, and completely sequenced. Exons 1–12 were analyzed by PCR with specific primers for rat NET located in the regions predicted to be intron-neighboring exons according to the human and mouse NET genes (11Porzgen P. Bonisch H.

Shero M. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63190) Google Scholar) and used to synthesize cDNA with avian myeloblastosis virus-reverse transcriptase and oligo(dT)15 primers (Boehringer Mannheim). To amplify alternative exons, we used the following PCR primers for rNETa-L (a and b), rNETa-S (a and c), and rNETb (a and d) as indicated in Fig. 1, A and C: a, 5′-TACGTCATCTACAAATTCTTCAGC; b, 5′-CGAAAAGAGGTCCTTGTCCTGG; c, 5′-CAATCCTATTTACACAGATGTAG; and d, 5′-CTGTGGGGCAGAGCTGTGGGGT. PCRs were performed by initial denaturation at 92 °C for 2 min, and then 40 cycles of 92 °C for 30 s, 57 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 90 s, with a final extension at 72 °C for 5 min. COS-7 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum at 5% CO2. Cells at subconfluence were harvested and transfected with the cDNA by electroporation (17Schaeffer J.C. Lin C.-L. Kitayama S. Uhl G.R. Mol. Brain Res. 1991; 9: 271-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Parallel transfection with a pcDNA3 vector alone was performed every time for the negative control. After electroporation, cells were diluted in the culture medium and plated in 24- or 48-well culture plates. After the 2-day culture, cells were washed three times with oxygenated Krebs-Ringer HEPES-buffered solution (KRH: 125 mm NaCl, 5.2 mm KCl, 1.2 mm CaCl2, 1.4 mm MgSO4, 1.2 mmKH2PO4, 5 mm glucose, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.3) and incubated for 10 min at 37 °C with [3H]norepinephrine (538.72 GBq/mmol, NEN Life Science Products) in KRH containing an inhibitor of its catalyzed enzymes, 50 μm pargyline and 100 μm ascorbate. After removal of excess radioligands, the cells were washed three times rapidly with ice-cold KRH, and any radioactivity remaining in the cells was extracted with NaOH and measured by liquid scintillation spectrometry. Nonspecific uptake was determined in the mock-transfected cells and also in each plate in the presence of 100 μmcocaine. Uptake of [3H]GABA (1409.7 GBq/mmol), [3H]glutamate (658.6 GBq/mmol), [3H]dopamine (888 GBq/mmol), and [3H]serotonin (1028.6 GBq/mmol) was performed in the same way (NEN Life Science Products). Specific binding of nisoxetine, a specific ligand for NET (18Tejani-Butt S.M. Brunswick D.J. Frazer A. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1990; 191: 239-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), to the plasma membrane NET was evaluated using radiolabeled nisoxetine and intact cells on ice (19Kitayama S. Shimada S. Xu H. Markham L. Donovan D.M. Uhl G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7782-7785Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). Transfected COS cells were washed with ice-cold KRH and incubated with 2 nm [3H]nisoxetine (3145 GBq/mmol, NEN Life Science Products) in KRH for 2 h on ice. Nonspecific binding was examined in the presence of 10 μm nisoxetine. For cold saturation analysis, cells were incubated in KRH containing 2 nm [3H]nisoxetine and 1–1000 nmcold nisoxetine. For hot saturation analysis, cells were incubated with 0.1–100 nm [3H]nisoxetine in the presence or absence of 10 μm nisoxetine. Data were analyzed by Scatchard plot using k cat (BioMetallics). From 5′- and 3′-RACE and subsequent nested PCR, we obtained from 5′-RACE two positive groups of clones of different sizes (about 0.7 and 0.9 kb) and one positive pool of several clones (about 2.0 kb) from 3′-RACE. Sequence analysis of these amplified fragments indicated that they were the 5′- and 3′-portions of the rat NET coding and noncoding regions. Because we failed to amplify the full-length cDNA from Marathon-ReadyTM cDNA used in RACE, the full-length cDNA of rat NET was cloned by PCR with reverse transcribed mRNA from rat brain and PC12 cells. The resulting amplifications showed two positive bands on agarose gel with lengths of approximately 4.0 and 2.4 kb, respectively. These were cloned into a mammalian expression vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) and analyzed by restriction enzymeXbaI and by functional expression in COS cells and [3H]dopamine uptake assay. The results showed that the shorter band consisted of two different messages, one of which lacked transport activity. The larger clones displayed [3H]dopamine transport activities (Fig.1 D). Nucleotide sequence analyses of each clone indicated that there were at least three different forms of rat NET (Fig. 1 A). Deduced amino acid sequences indicate that there are two NET proteins having different COOH-terminal tails, designated rNETa and rNETb (Fig. 1 B). The COOH-terminal tail of rNETa was homologous to human (3Pacholczyk T. Blakely D.R. Amara G.S. Nature. 1991; 350: 350-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (760) Google Scholar), bovine (9Lingen B. Bruess M. Boenisch H. FEBS Lett. 1994; 342: 235-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), and mouse (12Fritz J.D. Jayanthi L.D. Thoreson M.A. Blakely R.D. J. Neurochem. 1998; 70: 2241-2251Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) NET but not to another reported bovine NET (10Jursky F. Tamura S. Tamura A. Mandiyan S. Nelson H. Nelson N. J. Exp. Biol. 1994; 196: 283-295Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, the COOH terminus of rNETb showed no similarity to any known protein, including the latter bovine NET (10Jursky F. Tamura S. Tamura A. Mandiyan S. Nelson H. Nelson N. J. Exp. Biol. 1994; 196: 283-295Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Hydropathy analysis (20Kyte J. Doolittle R.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 105-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (17216) Google Scholar) demonstrated one additional hydrophobic region in rNETb capable of membrane spanning a structure. The scheme in Fig.1 B displays possible structures of rNETb having a hydrophobic region in the cytosol or in the plasma membrane. Precise membrane topology of rNETb needs to be determined using a specific antibody to the predicted COOH-terminal tail. Southern blot analysis using the 3′-flanking region of rNETa (rNET2–1) and rNETb (rNET2–4) indicated that three variants of rNET are derived from a single copy of the gene (data not shown). Therefore, it is suggested that rNETa and rNETb are produced by alternative RNA splicing. To confirm this, we isolated this region by PCR from rat genomic DNA using primer sets described in Fig. 1 A (P1/R6) and determined the gene organization. Approximately 4.5-kb PCR products contained 4 exons (exon 13–16), which were alternatively spliced as described in Fig. 1 A. Notably, rNETb was spliced differently within exon 13, skipping to the middle of exon 16. On the other hand, rNETa-S was spliced at exon 13 like rNETa-L but skipped to the middle of exon 16 at a site different from rNETb. Therefore, these splice variants used different exo-intronic splicing sites within the exons or introns. The expression of each rat NET mRNA variant was examined by reverse transcriptase-PCR using primers complementary to the regions specific for each variant (Fig. 1 A). The majority of the NET mRNA was rNETa-L and, to some extent, rNETb (Fig. 1 C). rNETa-S mRNA was not observed in this condition. Pacholczyk et al. (3Pacholczyk T. Blakely D.R. Amara G.S. Nature. 1991; 350: 350-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (760) Google Scholar) demonstrated two different sizes of mRNA encoding human NET having 5.8 and 3.6 kb, the latter being expressed in several brain regions and therefore a possible glial transporter. The present findings suggest that the larger mRNA may encode rNETa-L, and the smaller mRNA may encode rNETb and rNETa-S if any, although the difference in sequences may be because of alternative polyadenylation site usage (3Pacholczyk T. Blakely D.R. Amara G.S. Nature. 1991; 350: 350-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (760) Google Scholar). Systematic examination of rNETb mRNA expression in various regions of the brain or multiple tissues should provide clues regarding its physiological significance. The functional expression of each clone in the COS cells showed that [3H]dopamine uptake was observed in rNETa- but not rNETb-expressing COS cells (Fig. 1 D, left). These results suggest that rNETb lacks transport activity and/or that it is not expressed in the plasma membrane. To examine the latter possibility, we performed the binding of [3H]nisoxetine, a specific ligand for NET (18Tejani-Butt S.M. Brunswick D.J. Frazer A. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1990; 191: 239-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) in COS cells expressing rNETb under these conditions using intact cells (19Kitayama S. Shimada S. Xu H. Markham L. Donovan D.M. Uhl G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7782-7785Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). A small but significant binding of [3H]nisoxetine was observed in rNETb-expressing COS cells at 10 nm[3H]nisoxetine concentration (Fig. 1 D, right). However, further analysis of [3H]nisoxetine binding kinetics for rNETb could not be determined, because considerable binding was observed in mock-transfected control COS cells when the [3H]nisoxetine concentration in the incubation solution increased. In contrast, rNETa-expressing COS cells showed [3H]nisoxetine binding with an affinity of 5.99 ± 0.77 nm K D and a capacity of 3.50 ± 0.20 fmol/μg of protein B max(n = 3). It is therefore probable that expression of rNETb in the plasma membrane is partially restricted and that even expressed rNETb lacks transport activities. If rNETa and rNETb are present in the same cell, they might interact as suggested by DAT that makes homomultimeric structures (21Milner H.E. Beliveau R. Jarvis S.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1190: 185-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). First, we examined their interaction in COS cells by co-expression of rNETa and rNETb. Introduction of both cDNAs resulted in a reduction of [3H]norepinephrine uptake and [3H]nisoxetine binding, as compared with those observed in COS cells expressing rNETa alone (Fig.2 A). At a constant level of rNETa, introduction of increasing amounts of rNETb cDNA caused greater suppression of [3H]norepinephrine uptake and [3H]nisoxetine binding (Fig. 2 A). Expression levels of each mRNA did not change substantially in co-expression, as assessed by reverse transcriptase-PCR (data not shown). Kinetic analyses revealed a decrease in both K m andV max, reflecting an increase in apparent affinity for the substrate and decrease in transport rate for norepinephrine uptake: 2.46 ± 0.28 μm and 1.45 ± 0.14 μm of K m and 68.8 ± 5.8 fmol/μg of protein/min and 29.6 ± 1.9 fmol/μg of protein/min of V max in COS cells expressing rNETa alone or rNETa plus rNETb, respectively (Fig. 2 B). On the other hand, an increase in K D and decrease inB max of [3H]nisoxetine binding were observed in co-expression: 6.52 ± 1.77 nm and 18.28 ± 4.85 nm of K D and 2.00 ± 0.25 fmol/μg of protein and 1.74 ± 0.27 fmol/μg of protein of B max in COS cells expressing rNETa alone or rNETa plus rNETb, respectively. These results demonstrated the dominant negative effect of rNETb, suggesting the possible interaction of rNETa and rNETb, which may alter the properties of substrate transport and ligand binding. To clarify further the interaction mechanism and specificity, rNETb was co-expressed in COS cells with other rat neurotransmitter transporters including DAT, serotonin transporter (SERT), neuronal GABA transporter type 1 (GAT1) and glia glutamate/aspartate transporter (GLAST). Surprisingly, rNETb reduced the transport function of DAT (Fig.3 A), SERT (Fig.3 B), and GAT (Fig. 3 C) but not of GLAST (Fig.3 D). Co-transfection of neurotransmitter transporter cDNAs, e.g. NET and GAT1 or DAT and GAT1, had no effect on any function (data not shown). Furthermore, the functionless mutant of DAT, e.g. D1A in which Asp79 in the putative 1st transmembrane region was replaced by alanine (19Kitayama S. Shimada S. Xu H. Markham L. Donovan D.M. Uhl G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7782-7785Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar), did not change wild-type DAT activity by co-transfection (data not shown). These results suggest the possibility that rNETb inhibits functional expression of the transporter via interaction at some region that is specific for the subfamily of neurotransmitter transporters. Alternatively, if each neurotransmitter transporter has its own alternative spliced form like NET, each transporter may have its own regulatory mechanism via RNA splicing. It is suggested that membrane trafficking and sorting of neurotransmitter transporters are dependent on sequences encoded within the COOH tail as demonstrated in GABA and betaine transporters heterologously expressed in polarized epithelial cells (22Perego C. Bulbarelli A. Longhi R. Caimi M. Villa A. Caplan M.J. Pietrini G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6584-6592Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) and in the wild-type and COOH-terminal mutated DAT transiently expressed in COS cells (23Lee F.J.S. Pristupa Z.B. Ciliax B.J. Levey A.I. Niznik H.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20885-20894Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Many natural and artificial mutations have been observed to result in endoplasmic reticulum retention and degradation, apparently because they affect protein folding or oligomerization (24Klausner R.D. Sitia R. Cell. 1990; 62: 611-614Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar). Because oligomeric structure has been inferred for several neurotransmitter transporters including DAT (21Milner H.E. Beliveau R. Jarvis S.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1190: 185-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), these results suggest the involvement of several amino acids at the COOH terminus in the folding and/or oligomerization process of these neurotransmitter transporters. To date, there are several reports indicating that nuclear and plasma membrane hormone receptors, which were known to form a homo- or heterodimer to act, possessed dominant negative isoforms produced by alternative RNA splicing (see Refs.25Wang Y. Miksicek R.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1991; 5: 1707-1715Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 26Watanabe K. Fukuchi T. Hosoya H. Shirasawa T. Matuoka K. Miki H. Takenawa T. J. Biol.

Chem. 1997; 272: 26659-26664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar for negative evidence). Our results add a new example of this phenomenon specific to the nervous system. The regulation of NET expression in vivo has been investigated in accordance with the physiological and pathological relevance to adrenergic neural transmission, but the results are not consistent. Long term treatment with the tricyclic antidepressant desipramine, for example, has been reported to result in a decrease in norepinephrine uptake sites (29Lacroix D. Blier P. Curet O. de Montigny C. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1991; 257: 1081-1090PubMed Google Scholar, 30Bauer M.E. Tejani-Butt S.M. Brain Res. 1992; 582: 208-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). However, a recent in situhybridization study on NET mRNA expression following long term desipramine treatment showed a significant increase in hybridization signals in the locus ceruleus of rat brain (31Szot P. Ashliegh E.A. Kohen R. Petrie E. Dorsa D.M. Veith R. Brain Res. 1993; 618: 308-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Taken together, these suggest that the increase in mRNA expression for the NET may not lead to an increased transporter protein expressed on the plasma membrane of norepinephrine neurons. The probe used in the latter investigation was three endolabeled oligonucleotides complementary to the nucleotide sequences encoding the amino acids within 600 of the NET mRNA (3Pacholczyk T. Blakely D.R. Amara G.S. Nature. 1991; 350: 350-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (760) Google Scholar). Therefore, these probes labeled both rNETa and rNETb mRNAs. Based on the present observations, it is reasonable to assume that the increase in rNETb mRNA expression causes a reduction of NET protein on the plasma membrane even though expression of total RNA for NET increases. We propose that measurement of the mRNA expression ratio of rNETa versus rNETb may offer a physiological indicator of NET function. The regulation of alternative splicing of mRNA is brought about by complex processes in a spatial and/or temporal fashion. Mutation within a gene can lead to inappropriate pairing of 5′- and 3′-splice sites resulting in exon skipping or the recognition of cryptic 5′- and 3′-splice sites producing aberrantly spliced RNAs. A recent investigation of the glutamate transporter GLT-1 in relation to the neurodegenerative disease amyotrophic lateral sclerosis suggested a defect in the splicing machinery that leads to the use of inappropriate 5′- and 3′-splice sites (32Lin C.-L.G. Bristol L.A. Jin L. Dykes-Hoberg M. Crawford T. Clawson L. Rothstein J.D. Neuron. 1998; 20: 589-602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar). These aberrant RNAs function as dominant negative inhibitors of glutamate transport resulting in glutaminergic exitoneurotoxicity. However, alternative truncated mRNA of GLT-1 similar to this was observed in normal controls (33Nagai M. Abe K. Okamoto K. Itoyama Y. Neurosci. Lett. 1998; 244: 165-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). This latter observation thus suggested that the alternative splicing form of GLT-1 mRNA plays a physiological role in the central nervous system rather than a pathological one. The finding that alternative splicing of NET mRNA displays a dominant negative effect provides a novel mechanism for the regulation of synaptic transmission by neurotransmitter transporters and highlights the need for further investigation to learn whether this RNA processing is involved in neuronal disorders such as depression or vulnerability to drugs of abuse."

L., Irkens-Kiesecker, U., Rubinstein, B., and Taiz, L. (1996) J. Biol. Chem. 271, 1916–1924). However, the degree of nitrate-insensitivity fluctuates during the course of the year with a seasonal frequency. Nitrate uncouples H+ pumping from ATP hydrolysis both in epicotyls and in nitrate-sensitive fruit V-ATPases. Neither bafilomycin nor oxidation cause uncoupling. The initial rate H+/ATP coupling ratios of epicotyl and the nitrate-sensitive fruit proton pumping activities are the same. However, the H+/ATP coupling ratio of the nitrate-insensitive fruit H+ pumping activity is lower than that of nitrate-sensitive and epicotyl V-ATPases. Several properties of the nitrate-insensitive H+-ATPase of the fruit indicate that it is a modified V-ATPase rather than a P-ATPase: 1) insensitivity to low concentrations of vanadate; 2) it is initially strongly uncoupled by nitrate, but regains coupling as catalysis proceeds; 3) both the nitrate-sensitive and nitrate-insensitive fruit H+-pumps have identicalK m values for MgATP, and show similar pH-dependent slip and proton leakage rates. We conclude that the ability of the juice sac V-ATPase to build up steep pH gradients involves three factors: variable coupling,i.e. the ability to regain coupling under conditions that initially induce uncoupling; a low pH-dependent slip rate; the low proton permeability of the membrane. Lemon fruit tonoplasts, unlike those of seedling epicotyls, contain nitrate-insensitive H+-ATPase activity (Müller, M. L., Irkens-Kiesecker, U., Rubinstein, B., and Taiz, L. (1996) J. Biol. Chem. 271, 1916–1924). However, the degree of nitrate-insensitivity fluctuates during the course of the year with a seasonal frequency. Nitrate uncouples H+ pumping from ATP hydrolysis both in epicotyls and in nitrate-sensitive fruit V-ATPases. Neither bafilomycin nor oxidation cause uncoupling.

Harrison M.A. Biochem. J. 1997; 324: 697-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). V-ATPases are structurally related to the ATP synthases, or F-ATPases, of mitochondria and chloroplasts. F- and V-ATPases exhibit many structural and functional similarities at the molecular level, including several homologous subunits which play central roles in catalysis and proton transport (2Taiz L. Nelson N. Baltscheffsky H. Origin and Evolution of Biological Energy Conversion. VCH Verlagsgesellschaft, Germany1996: 291-305Google Scholar, 3Bowman B.J. Bowman E.J. Brambl R. Marzluf G.A. The Mycota III. A Comprehensive Treatise on Fungi as Experimental Systems for Basic and Applied Research: Biochemistry and Molecular Biology. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1996: 57-83Google Scholar). Because of these similarities in structure and catalytic mechanism, F- and V-ATPases are also thought to exhibit similar mechanochemical properties (4Oster G. Wang H. Encyclopedia of Molecular Biology. 1999; (in press)Google Scholar). When operating in ATP synthesis mode, F-ATPases convert the proton-motive force present across the internal membrane of chloroplasts and mitochondria into a rotary torque used to drive the synthesis of ATP by the catalytic F1 sector (5Junge W. Lill H. Engelbrecht S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 420-423Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar, 6Yasuda R. Noji H. Kinosita K. Motojima F. Yoshida M. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1997; 29: 207-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Conversely, when F-ATPases operate in proton pumping mode, they hydrolyze ATP at their catalytic site and convert the liberated energy into a rotary torque utilized to drive proton transport across the membrane (7Noji H. Yasuda R. Yoshida M. Kinosita K. Nature. 1997; 386: 299-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (1924) Google Scholar). V-ATPases are also thought to operate via a rotary mechanism, even though direct experimental evidence for rotation is lacking (1Finbow M.E. Harrison M.A. Biochem. J. 1997; 324: 697-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). In V- and F-ATPases, the efficiency of coupling between ATP hydrolysis and proton transport represents a critical, rate-limiting factor. Both pumps have been proposed to undergo slip, or intrinsic uncoupling, under specific conditions (8Groth G. Junge W. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 8103-8111Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 9Evron Y. Avron M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1019: 115-120Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 10Moriyama Y. Nelson N. Stein W.D. The Ion Pumps: Structure, Function, and Regulation. Alan R. Liss, Inc., New York1988: 387-394Google Scholar). During slip, ATP is hydrolyzed at the catalytic site without being coupled to H+ transport. Since typical V-ATPases are known to operate far from thermodynamic equilibrium, slip may represent one of the enzyme's regulatory mechanisms. In lemon fruit juice sac cells, the vacuolar pH can reach as low as 2.2, about 3 pH units lower than in typical plant vacuoles. In fact, the trans-tonoplast pH gradient in lemon fruits is close to the calculated maximum for a V-ATPase operating at thermodynamic equilibrium (4 to 5 pH units) assuming an H+/ATP stoichiometry of 2 (11Schmidt A.L. Briskin D.P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 301: 165-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 12Rea P.A. Sanders D. Physiol. Plant. 1987; 71: 131-141Crossref Scopus (277) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that proton pumping by tonoplast-enriched juice sac vesicles is largely insensitive to the V-ATPase inhibitors nitrate, bafilomycin A1, and partially sensitive to high vanadate concentrations (50 to 300 μm) (13Müller M.L. Irkens-Kiesecker U. Rubinstein B. Taiz L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1916-1924Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The proton pumping activity of juice sac vesicles is also less sensitive to oxidation andN-ethylmaleimide (NEM) than that of tonoplast-enriched vesicles from seedling epicotyls. In addition, cold inactivation in the presence of nitrate, which completely inhibits proton transport in epicotyl vesicles, has little effect on the H+ pumping activity of juice sac vesicles, even though the treatment induces the release of similar proportions of catalytic subunits from both types of vesicles. Since V1 dissociation treatment increased the sensitivity of the juice sac H+ pumping activity to vanadate, we hypothesized that a second, vanadate-sensitive proton pump, possibly possessing a lower H+/ATP stoichiometry that enables it to generate a steeper pH gradient than the V-ATPase, may be present on the tonoplasts of juice sac cells (13Müller M.L. Irkens-Kiesecker U. Rubinstein B. Taiz L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1916-1924Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). After purification and reconstitution into artificial proteoliposomes, both the epicotyl and juice sac proton pumps exhibited equal sensitivities to nitrate, bafilomycin A1, NEM, and oxidation. Thus, the insensitivity of the juice sac H+pumping activity to these inhibitors appears to depend on some component(s) of the native membrane. However, purified and reconstituted fruit V-ATPases remained partially sensitive to vanadate and exhibited only half as much slip as the epicotyl V-ATPase (14Müller M.L. Irkens-Kiesecker U. Kramer D. Taiz L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12762-12770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Slip was calculated from proton pumping curves, in the absence of an electric potential gradient, by the method of Tu et al.(15Tu S.-I. Nagahashi G. Brouillette J.N. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1987; 256: 625-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Under these conditions, slip reflects intrinsic uncoupling induced by the build-up of a pH gradient across the membrane. This method gives no indication on the H+/ATP coupling ratio of the pump in the absence of a pH gradient. H+/ATP coupling ratios provide a measure of pump efficiency (16Elston T. Wang H. Oster G. Nature. 1998; 391: 510-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). If two pumps have the same H+/ATP stoichiometry, but differ in their coupling ratios, the pump with the higher H+/ATP coupling ratio would be expected to generate a steeper ΔpH than the pump with the lower coupling ratio. Thus the coupling ratio of the lemon fruit V-ATPase might be higher than that of the epicotyl V-ATPase even if the two pumps had the same stoichiometry. To test this hypothesis, we have carried out experiments to characterize the coupling ratios of the fruit and epicotyl V-ATPases under initial rate conditions. Moreover, since the H+pumping activity of the fruit is relatively insensitive to V1 dissociation, we also determined the effect of V1 dissociation treatment on the coupling ratio of the juice sac proton pump(s). Our results show that, in contrast to pH-dependent slip, the H+/ATP coupling ratios of the juice sac and epicotyl proton pumps, determined under initial rate conditions, are the same. Whereas V1 dissociation with nitrate induced the complete uncoupling of the epicotyl V-ATPase, only a fraction of the fruit H+ pumping activity was uncoupled under identical conditions. However, the kinetic properties of the juice sac proton pumps after V1 dissociation treatment were identical to those in the control vesicles. This strongly suggests that in juice sac vesicles, the residual proton pumping activity after V1 dissociation treatment belongs to a nitrate-resistant subpopulation of V-ATPases, rather than to a different type of proton pump. A 20 month analysis of the nitrate sensitivity of tonoplast-enriched vesicles from juice sacs showed that the proportion of nitrate resistant activity varied during the course of the year. As the proportion of uncoupled enzymes varies, the overall H+/ATP coupling ratio measured in juice sac vesicles changes. The significance of this type of variable H+/ATP coupling in lemon fruits is unclear, but the nitrate resistant activity may represent a specialized group of V-ATPases which, under extreme conditions, is able to maintain, if not build up, the large ΔpH across the tonoplast of juice sacs. Lemon seeds (Citrus limon L. var. Schaub Rough Lemon) for growing seedling epicotyls were generously supplied by Willits & Newcomb, Inc., Arvin, CA. Lemon fruits (var. Eureka) were harvested from a tree on the campus of the University of California, Santa Cruz. Reduced nicotinamide-adenine dinucleotide (NADH) was from Boehringer Mannheim. All other chemicals were purchased from Sigma or Fisher. Tonoplast-enriched membranes from lemon fruit juice sacs and epicotyls were prepared as described previously (14Müller M.L. Irkens-Kiesecker U. Kramer D. Taiz L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12762-12770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Fruit juice sacs were homogenized in fruit homogenization buffer (1.5 m MOPS-KOH, pH 8.5, 2.25% polyvinylpyrrolidone 40, 0.75% bovine serum albumin, 7.5 mm EDTA, 2 mm DTT, and 0.1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and epicotyls were homogenized in epicotyl homogenization buffer (0.5 m MOPS-KOH, pH 8.5, 1.5% polyvinylpyrrolidone 40, 0.5% bovine serum albumin, 5 mm EDTA, 2 mm DTT, and 0.1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). After a first centrifugation of the homogenates for 20 min at 12,000 × g, the supernatants was subjected to ultracentrifugation for 60 min at 132,000 ×g, and the microsomal pellets obtained were further purified on a 10/35% sucrose step gradient for 60 min at 132,000 ×g. The 10/35% interface containing tonoplast-enriched membranes was recovered, diluted with RB (10 mm BTP-Mes, pH 7.0, 20 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mmDTT, and 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and pelleted for 20 min at 174,000 × g. The tonoplast-enriched membranes were resuspended in RB at a final concentration of ∼5 μg of membrane protein/μl. Membrane vesicles were made up to 0.3 mg of protein/ml in 2.5 ml of RB containing 5 mmATP, 7 mm MgSO4, and 0 or 500 mmKNO3. They were incubated on ice for 1 h and centrifuged 15 min at 412,000 × g. The membrane pellet was resuspended in 750 μl of RB and used for activity measurements and immunoblotting. The proteins in 50 μl of the resuspended pellet and 167 μl of the supernatant were used for immunoblotting after being precipitated with 10% trichloroacetic acid, washed with cold acetone, lyophilized, and separated by SDS-PAGE. Proton pumping and ATP hydrolysis by tonoplast-enriched vesicles were measured simultaneously by using the continuous spectrophotometric assay of Palmgren (17Palmgren M.G. Plant Physiol. 1990; 94: 882-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). In this assay, proton transport into the vesicles was followed by measuring the absorbance decrease of acridine orange at 495 nm. Simultaneously, ATP hydrolysis was measured by coupling the appearance of ADP to the oxidation of NADH and by following the NADH absorbance decrease at 340 nm. The assay medium consisted of 10 mm MOPS-BTP, pH 7.0, 2 mm ATP, 150 mm KCl, 1 mm sodium azide, 0.5 μm valinomycin, 0.25 mm very freshly prepared NADH, 1 mm phosphoenolpyruvate, 20 μm acridine orange, and 25 μl/ml of a mixture of pyruvate kinase and lactate dehydrogenase (Sigma). 50 μmsodium vanadate was also present in the mixture unless stated differently. The reaction was started with 4 mmMgCl2 and the absorbance values at 340 and 495 nm were recorded in 15-s intervals with a Spectronic Genesis 5 spectrophotometer (Spectronic, Rochester, NY) interfaced with a PC running the MultiWL computer program (M. L. Müller and A. Murphy). After correction for mixing artifacts, the results were loaded into a graphics program and plotted out (Fig.1). When activity rates are reported, the slopes of the initial rates of proton pumping and ATP hydrolysis were calculated and expressed in arbitrary units (a.u.). The calculated H+/ATP coupling ratios were independent of the amount of membrane protein used in the assay (data not shown). We nevertheless chose to do all experiments in the presence of 20–25 μg of membrane protein, unless stated differently. When proton pumping was measured in the presence of nitrate in the reaction mixture, quinacrine fluorescence quenching was substituted for acridine orange absorbance quenching. If the effect of nitrate was to be assessed on proton pumping alone, the conditions were as described previously (13Müller M.L. Irkens-Kiesecker U. Rubinstein B. Taiz L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1916-1924Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). If H+/ATP coupling ratios were to be determined, quinacrine fluorescence quenching was measured in the assay mixture described above, so that H+ pumping and ATP hydrolysis activities were measured in the same conditions. Because the initial rate of H+ pumping differed from the maximum activity rate in the presence of nitrate, the latter was chosen for all activity measurements in the presence of nitrate. The proteins of tonoplast-enriched vesicles from epicotyls and juice sacs were separated by SDS-PAGE according to Laemmli (18Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205523) Google Scholar) in 12% polyacrylamide gels and the transfer to nitrocellulose was done as described previously (13Müller M.L. Irkens-Kiesecker U. Rubinstein B. Taiz L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1916-1924Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The blots were incubated with a primary antibody to the 70-kDa subunit of the corn V-ATPase and visualized by a peroxidase-coupled secondary antibody reaction (Vectastain ABC kit, Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) (13Müller M.L. Irkens-Kiesecker U. Rubinstein B. Taiz L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1916-1924Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Estimates of protein concentrations were done routinely with Amido Black (19Popov N. Schmitt M. Matthies H. Acta Biol. Med. Ger. 1975; 34: 1441-1446PubMed Google Scholar). Although we had previously found that proton pumping by fruit juice sac vesicles was largely insensitive to inhibition by nitrate and bafilomycin A1 (13Müller M.L. Irkens-Kiesecker U. Rubinstein B. Taiz L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1916-1924Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) (TableI), we observed that there was some variability in the nitrate insensitivity of the lemon fruit V-ATPase from one membrane preparation to another (Fig. 2). Fig. 3 A shows the nitrate sensitivity of tonoplast-enriched fruit vesicles from preparations made over a period of 20 months. All fruits were harvested at the same state of development from a single tree situated on the campus of the University of California, Santa Cruz. We found that, over the duration of the experiment, the inhibition of the proton pumping activity by 100 mm KNO3 followed a sigmoidal pattern, ranging from 0 to 20% inhibition in the fall to 70–80% in the spring.Table ISensitivity of the Citrus limon V-ATPases to nitrate and bafilomycin A1TreatmentEpicotylFruitactivity, %Control100100100 mm KNO31 ± 072 ± 101 nm Bafilomycin A126 ± 192 ± 9The proton pumping activities of tonoplast-enriched vesicles from juice sacs and seedling epicotyls were measured in the presence of the typical V-ATPase inhibitors nitrate and bafilomycin A1.

Quinacrine fluorescence quenching was here used to measure proton transport. In addition to the seasonal variation in nitrate sensitivity noted above, a temporal component was also observed in the kinetic study of nitrate inhibition. As shown in Fig. 3 B, even in a “nitrate-insensitive” juice sac preparation, H+ pumping appeared to be initially inhibited by nitrate. However, after 1–2 min, the activity underwent a progressive “recovery” to reach a maximum rate comparable to that of the control. This temporal delay in the attainment of the maximum rate of proton pumping was observed under all experimental conditions used (including experiments done in the presence of acridine orange) and whether an ATP regeneration system was present or not. However, we observed that the ATP regeneration system tended to reduce the magnitude of the delay. In contrast to H+ pumping, ATP hydrolysis did not show a similar lag phase (data not shown). This suggests that in the presence of KNO3, the fruit proton pumps were initially uncoupled, but became progressively coupled as catalysis progressed. The lemon fruit V-ATPase was previously found to be partially sensitive to high concentrations (≥200 μm) of vanadate (13Müller M.L. Irkens-Kiesecker U. Rubinstein B. Taiz L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1916-1924Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 14Müller M.L. Irkens-Kiesecker U. Kramer D. Taiz L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12762-12770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). We therefore tested the effects of vanadate on the initial rates of proton pumping (Fig.4, A and B) and ATP hydrolysis (Fig. 4, C and D), and on the deduced coupling ratio (Fig. 4, E and F) of tonoplast vesicles from juice sacs and epicotyls. Curves representing two types of juice sac preparations are shown, a “nitrate sensitive” one (open circles), which was ∼70% inhibited by 100 mm KNO3, and a “nitrate insensitive” preparation (open triangles), which was inhibited only ∼30% by the same concentration of nitrate. As shown in Fig. 4, A and C, respectively, proton pumping and ATP hydrolysis by tonoplast vesicles of epicotyls exhibited little sensitivity to vanadate in the 0–50 μm range. Thus, the deduced coupling ratio of the epicotyl V-ATPase increased only slightly between 10 and 50 μm vanadate. The lack of effect of vanadate suggests that contaminating P-ATPase activity is not a significant factor in our measurements of the coupling ratio of the epicotyl V-ATPase (Fig. 4 E). High concentrations of vanadate inhibited proton pumping to some extent, while ATP hydrolysis appeared to be stimulated under the same conditions. However, this latter effect appeared to be an artifact due to the oxidative properties of vanadate which, at high concentration, oxidized the NADH used in the coupled assay (data not shown). In contrast to the results with tonoplast vesicles from epicotyls, ATP hydrolysis by lemon fruit membranes was inhibited by ∼50% by 50 μm vanadate (Fig. 4 D). However, proton pumping was only slightly inhibited by low concentrations of vanadate in both the nitrate-sensitive and the nitrate-insensitive preparations. This suggests that a considerable amount of contaminating plasma membrane ATPase activity, presumably in the form of leaky vesicles incapable of generating a ΔpH, may be present in the fruit tonoplast-enriched preparations. Both ATP hydrolysis and proton pumping were inhibited by 400 μm vanadate to ∼60% of their activity in the presence of 50 μm vanadate. The nitrate-sensitive fruit preparation was about twice as active in proton pumping as the nitrate-insensitive activity. As a result, the coupling ratio calculated for the nitrate-sensitive preparation is about 70% higher than that of the nitrate-insensitive preparation, and is comparable to the coupling ratio of the epicotyl V-ATPase (Fig. 4 F). We previously reported that cold dissociation in the presence of KNO3 caused the release of catalytic subunits from fruit vesicles without affecting the total ATP-dependent H+ pumping activity relative to controls (13Müller M.L. Irkens-Kiesecker U. Rubinstein B. Taiz L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1916-1924Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The only effect of nitrate treatment on the fruit H+ pumping activity was to increase the sensitivity to high concentrations of vanadate (200 μm) from 30% inhibition in control vesicles (treated with cold an 5 mm MgATP alone) to 60–70% in vesicles treated with cold 5 mm MgATPand 500 mm KNO3. Fig.5 confirms that the amount of catalytic subunit released from fruit membranes by nitrate was comparable to the amount dissociated from epicotyl vesicles, as determined by immunoblotting. The ATP-dependent proton pumping activity, measured in the absence of vanadate, is given below the immunoblots. To determine whether the H+/ATP coupling ratio of the fruit V-ATPase had been altered by the treatment with 500 mmKNO3, nitrate-insensitive and nitrate-sensitive fruit vesicle preparations were subjected to cold inactivation in the presence or absence of 500 mm KNO3. H+ pumping and ATP hydrolysis were measured simultaneously after washing the cold-released vesicles with buffer. The results are shown in Fig. 6 (A toD). For a comparison, the activity of similarly treated epicotyl vesicles is also presented (Fig. 6, E andF). In the nitrate-insensitive fruit preparation, KNO3 treatment had little or no effect on either the H+ pumping or ATP hydrolysis activities (Fig.6 A) and thus, the coupling ratio of the nitrate-insensitive preparation was unaffected. However, the nitrate-treated sample was strongly inhibited by 500 μm vanadate (Fig.6 B). The results obtained with the nitrate-sensitive fruit preparation confirmed these findings (Fig. 6, C andD) and showed that 50 μm vanadate was sufficient to inhibit most of the proton pumping activity after KNO3 treatment. Table IIshows a comparison of the H+ pumping and hydrolytic activities, and the coupling ratios of the “partially nitrate-sensitive” fruit preparation used in Fig. 6, C andD. Under control conditions (non-dissociated), the vanadate-sensitive ATPase activity was largely independent of H+ pumping, since 50 μm vanadate inhibited ATP hydrolysis by 58% and H+ pumping by only 16%. However, after V1 dissociation, 50 μmvanadate inhibited ATP hydrolysis and H+ pumping by 71 and 74%, respectively, indicating that the vanadate-sensitive ATP hydrolytic activity is coupled to proton transport. Since the amount of vanadate-sensitive H+ pumping activity was doubled inabsolute value after V1 dissociation (0.27 to 0.54 arbitrary units), the dissociation procedure appears to have partially transformed the vanadate-insensitive H+ pumping activity into a vanadate-sensitive activity. Overall, the H+/ATP coupling ratio of the partially nitrate-sensitive preparation, which in the control was 2.66 a.u. in the presence of 50 μm vanadate, dropped to 0.61 ± 0.04 a.u. after V1 dissociation, whether vanadate was present or not (Table II). Thus V1 dissociation has a major uncoupling effect on the nitrate-sensitive H+ pumping activity of juice sac vesicles.Table IIActivities and coupling ratios of fruit tonoplast vesicles treated for V1 dissociationTreatmentATP hydrolysisH+ pumpingCoupling ratioActivityVO4inhibitionActivityVO4inhibitiona.u.a.u.%a.u.a.u.%a.u.−VO41.241.671.34Control0.72580.2716+50 μm VO40.531.402.66−VO41.120.730.65V1-dissociated0.80710.5474+50 μmVO40.320.190.58The proton pumping and hydrolytic activities of a partially nitrate-sensitive juice sac preparation were determined under the conditions described in the legend to Fig. 6.

Activities and coupling ratios are given in arbitrary units and the inhibition by 50 μm vanadate is given in arbitrary units and as a percentage of the activity of the sample not treated with vanadate. A detailed analysis of vanadate sensitivity and coupling ratios was also performed under control and V1 dissociation conditions for a nitrate-sensitive fruit preparation (Fig.7). In the control vesicles, 50 μm vanadate inhibited proton pumping by only 27% (Fig.7 A), whereas ATP hydrolysis was inhibited by 53% by the same concentration (Fig. 7 B). After V1dissociation, 50 and 100 μm vanadate inhibited the proton pumping activity by 69 and 89%, respectively (Fig. 7 A). The H+/ATP coupling ratio, which in the control was ∼1.8 a.u. in the presence of 50 μm vanadate, dropped to ∼0.62 a.u. after V1 dissociation (Fig. 7 C). At 400 μm vanadate the coupling ratio of the control was ∼2.3, while that of the V1 dissociated membranes was ∼0.1. Thus, high concentrations of vanadate have opposite effects on the coupling ratios of control versus V1 dissociated vesicles, increasing the former while decreasing the latter.

They were tested for stimulation of secretin release from murine neuroendocrine intestinal tumor cell line STC-1 and secretin cells enriched mucosal cell preparations isolated from rat upper small intestine. Each enzyme preparation was found to contain several components of secretin-releasing activity. Each bioactive fraction was purified to homogeneity by rechromatography and then subjected to mass spectral analysis and assays of PLA2 and secretin-releasing activities. It was found that the fraction with highest enzymatic activity also had the highest secretin-releasing activity and the sameM r as porcine pancreatic PLA2. Moreover, it also had the same N-terminal amino acid sequence (up to 30 residues determined) as that of porcine pancreatic PLA2, suggesting that it was identical to the enzyme. Purified porcine pancreatic PLA2 also stimulated secretin release concentration-dependently from both STC-1 cells and a mucosal cell preparation enriched in secretin-containing endocrine cells isolated from rat duodenum. Abolishment of the enzymatic activity by pretreatment with bromophenacyl bromide did not affect its secretin-releasing activity. The stimulatory effect of purified pancreatic PLA2 on secretin secretion from STC-1 cells was inhibited by an L-type Ca2+ channel blocker, by down-regulation of protein kinase C or by pretreatment of the cell with pertussis toxin. It is concluded that porcine pancreatic PLA2 possesses an intrinsic secretin-releasing activity that was independent of its enzymatic activity. This action is pertussis toxin-sensitive and is in part dependent on Ca2+ influx through the L-type channel and activation of protein kinase C. We have isolated, from canine pancreatic juice, two 14-kDa proteins with secretin-releasing activity that had N-terminal sequence homology with canine pancreatic phospholipase A2 (PLA2).

Phospholipases A2(PLA2) 1The abbreviations used are: PLA2, phospholipase A2; CCK, cholecystokinin; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; PTX, pertussis toxin; SRF, secretin-releasing factor; β-TPA, 4β-12-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate; BPB, 4-bromophenacyl bromide. are a family of enzymes that catalyze hydrolysis of ester bond atsn-2 position of phospholipids producing fatty acids and lysophospholipids. These enzymes exist either in extracellular secretions or intracellularly in the cell cytosol or other organelles (1Dennis E.A. J. Biol.

The cytosolic forms, including an 85-kDa enzyme and other smaller forms, are believed to function as effector enzymes in various receptor-mediated signal transduction cascades that involve the release of arachidonic acid as the second messenger. The secretory PLA2s are classified into three major subtypes according to their primary structural homology with PLA2s purified from snake venom (1Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13057-13060Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Murakami M. Arm J.P. Austen K.F. Ann. N. Y. Acad.

Those from the Elapidae and Hydrophidae are grouped as type I and those from Crotalidae and Viperidae as type II. The bee venom PLA2, which has no sequence homology with either types of snake PLA2s, but has a similar structural organization for calcium ion binding and catalytic domains (4Scott D.L. Sigler P.B. Adv. Protein Chem. 1994; 45: 53-88Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), is classified as Type III. Both type I and type II PLA2s are 14–18-kDa proteins that are dependent on Ca2+ in milimolar concentration for enzymatic activity. In mammalian species, both type I and type II secretory PLA2s of 14 kDa (1Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13057-13060Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Murakami M. Arm J.P.

Chem. 1997; 272: 222-227Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) have been isolated. Pancreatic PLA2 is a type I enzyme secreted into the pancreatic juice. Non-pancreatic PLA2 isolated from other tissues and tissue fluids, including the one isolated from human synovial fluid of rheumatoid arthritis, are type II enzymes. However, it has become clear recently that type I PLA2 is also present in other tissues, including kidney, small intestine, spleen, lung, and stomach (6Matsuda Y. Ogawa M. Shibata T. Nakaguchi K. Nishijiama J. Wakasugi C. Mori T. Res. Commun. Chem. Pathol. Pharmacol. 1987; 58: 281-284PubMed Google Scholar,7Sakata T. Nakmura E. Tsuruta Y. Tamaki M. Teraoka H. Tojo H. Ono T. Okamoto M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 1007: 124-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Along with function as an extracellular enzyme, type I PLA2has been shown to elicit receptor-mediated cellular responses, including stimulation of prostaglandin (8Tohkin M. Kishino J. Ishizaki J. Arita H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2865-2871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and steroid hormone (9Nomura K. Fujita H. Arita H.

FEBS Lett. 1992; 303: 217-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Specific receptors for secretory PLA2have been cloned (14Ishizaki J. Hanasaki K. Higashino K. Kishino J. Kikuchi N. Ohara O.

Receptor binding and receptor-mediated action by type I PLA2 is not dependent on Ca2+nor PLA2's enzymatic activity (16Ishizaki J. Kishino J. Teraoka H. Ohara O. Arita H.

Chem. 1995; 270: 5534-5540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Thus, type I PLA2 appears to have a cell-mediated function independent of its enzymatic activity. We have shown previously in the rat (18Li P. Lee K.Y. Chang T.-M. Chey W.Y. J. Clin. Invest. 1990; 86: 1474-1479Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) that acid-induced release of secretin from secretin cells in the upper intestinal mucosa is mediated by a lumenally active secretin-releasing factor (SRF). Similarly, canine pancreatic juice has also been shown to possess an SRF activity (19Li P. Song Y. Chang T.-M. Chey W.Y. Dig. Dis. Sci. 1994; 39: 1806Google Scholar). Our attempt to isolate SRF from canine pancreatic juice has led to the purification of two SRFs of 14 kDa whose N-terminal sequences were identical to that of canine pancreatic PLA2 (20Chang T.-M. Lee K.Y. Chang C.H.L. Li P. Song Y. Chey W.Y. Regul. Pept. 1996; 64: 22Google Scholar). This observation suggests that pancreatic PLA2 may function as a modulator of intestinal endocrine cells besides its function as a digestive enzyme. In the present report we will present evidence that pancreatic PLA2 indeed possesses secretin-releasing activity by acting directly on secretin-producing cells. This action is independent of its enzymatic activity and appears to involve a receptor-mediated signal cascade. Porcine pancreatic PLA2 was obtained from Sigma or Boehringer Mannheim. Diltiazem, 4β-12-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (β-TPA), 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, 4-bromophenacyl bromide (BPB), HPLC grade trifluoroacetic acid, and pertussis toxin were purchased from Sigma. HPLC grade water and acetonitrile were obtained from Fisher. Percoll and 1,2-bis-(S-decanoyl)-1,2-dithio-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine were obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech and Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR, respectively. Streptomycin, penicillin, and gentamycin sulfate were obtained from Flow Laboratories, McLean, VA. All the tissue culture ware and media were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. Porcine pancreatic PLA2 suspended in ammonium sulfate solution was centrifuged in an Eppendorff microcentrifuge for 2 min at 4 °C. The supernatant solution was removed, and the pellet corresponding to 2.5 mg of protein was dissolved in 16% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and injected into a Vydac 218TP semipreparative column (7.5 × 250 mm). The column was linked to an ISCO single pump HPLC system (ISCO, Omaha, NE) consisting of a model 2360 gradient former, a model 2350 pump, and a V4 absorbance detector that were controlled by an IBM personal computer. The column was pre-equilibrated with 20% elution solvent B and then eluted with a gradient of 30–54% solvent B at an increment rate of 0.3%/min followed by 54–100% solvent B at 2.3%/min at a flow rate of 2.5 ml/min. The elution solvents were: solvent A, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and solvent B, 80% acetonitrile/0.09% trifluoroacetic acid. The elution profile was monitored by absorbance at 215 nm. The major peaks were collected and dried in vacuo in a Speed Vac (Savant Instrument, Inc., Farmingdale, NY). Each peak was rechromatographed to obtain a homogenous single peak and tested for PLA2 enzymatic activity, secretin-releasing activity, and molecular mass determination. Two mg of purified PLA2were dissolved in 0.5 ml Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline and then incubated with 0.1 mm BPB at room temperature in the dark for 18 h. The reaction mixture was then passed through a Sephadex G25 column (0.9 × 25 cm) equilibrated in the same phosphate-buffered saline to collect the protein peak. The concentration of the BPB-treated enzyme was determined by protein assay as described below. STC-1 cells of a murine intestinal neuroendocrine tumor cell line that secrete secretin (21Rindi G. Grant S.G.N. Yiangou Y. Ghatei M.A. Bloom S.R. Bautch V.L. Solcia E. Polak J.M. Am. J. Pathol. 1990; 136: 1336-1349Google Scholar) were maintained in monolayer cultures in 24-well plates as described previously (22Chang C.H.L. Chey W.Y. Braggins L. Coy D.H. Chang T.-M. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: G516-G523PubMed Google Scholar, 23Chang C.H. Chey W.Y. Sun Q. Leiter A. Chang T.-M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1221: 339-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Mucosal cells enriched in secretin-containing endocrine cells were prepared by collagenase digestion of rat duodenal mucosa followed by centrifugation in a discontinuous Percoll density gradient according to a method described previously (24Chang C.H. Chey W.Y. Erway B. Coy D.H. Chang T.-M. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: G190-G202Google Scholar). The release of secretin from STC-1 or rat mucosal cell preparation was studied as described previously (24Chang C.H. Chey W.Y. Erway B. Coy D.H. Chang T.-M. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: G190-G202Google Scholar). Briefly, monolayers of STC-1 cells were incubated in the presence or absence of porcine pancreatic PLA2 at various concentrations or other agents in Earle's balanced salt solution containing 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 5 mm sodium pyruvate, 2 mml-glutamine, 0.01% soybean trypsin inhibitor, and 0.2% bovine serum albumin under 95% air, 5% CO2 at 37 °C for 60 min or various time periods as specified. The plate was chilled on ice, and an aliquot of the medium was then removed for assay of secretin using a specific radioimmunoassay as described (24Chang C.H. Chey W.Y. Erway B. Coy D.H. Chang T.-M. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: G190-G202Google Scholar, 25Chang T.-M. Chey W.Y. Dig. Dis. Sci. 1980; 25: 529-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). In some experiments the cells were preincubated with diltiazem (10 μm) for 30 min or either pertussis toxin (10 ng/ml) or β-TPA (0.1 μm) for 10 h before incubation of the cells with PLA2 and assay of secretin release. Rat S cell-enriched preparation was suspended at 0.5–1.0 × 106 cells/ml in Hanks' balanced salt solution containing Hepes, l-glutamine, pyruvate, soybean trypsin inhibitor, and bovine serum albumin as described above for Earle's balanced salt solution. The cell suspension was incubated in the absence or presence of varying concentrations of PLA2 or other test agents under 95% O2, 5% CO2 with gentle gyration in a water bath at 37 °C for 30 min. The cell suspension was then centrifuged at 500 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, and an aliquot of the supernatant was removed for assay of secretin. The cell pellet was extracted with 0.1 n HCl and centrifuged at 17,100 ×g and 4 °C for 30 min. The supernatant solution was lyophilized and used for assay of the cellular content of secretin. The data were calculated as the amount of secretin-like immunoreactivity (in femtomoles) released per milligram of cell protein or in percentage of total cellular content. The effect of PLA2 was determined by comparing the amount of secretin released in the presence of PLA2 and that of the corresponding control. Stimulation of secretin release was expressed as percentage over the corresponding control. All data were presented as mean ± S.E. Intracellular cAMP content was measured by radioimmunoassay using the assay kit obtained from Biomedical Technologies, Inc., Stoughton, MA, as described previously (22Chang C.H.L. Chey W.Y. Braggins L. Coy D.H. Chang T.-M. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: G516-G523PubMed Google Scholar). Cellular content of inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate was determined by a radioreceptor assay using an assay kit purchased from NEN Life Science Products as described (24Chang C.H. Chey W.Y. Erway B. Coy D.H. Chang T.-M. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: G190-G202Google Scholar). Amino acid sequence analysis was carried out by Edman degradation using an Applied Biosystem 477A automated sequencer located in the Department of Dental Research, University of Rochester School of Medicine and Dentistry. Mass spectra of protein and peptides were determined by Core Laboratory, Louisiana State University Medical Center, New Orleans, LA using a Matrix-assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization Time-of-Flight Delayed Extraction Mass Spectrometer (PerSeptive Biosystems Inc., Cambridge, MA). Cellular protein was determined by the bicinchoninic acid method using the assay kit provided by Pierce using crystalline bovine serum albumin as a standard. Phospholipase A2 activity was determined by the microplate assay method of Reynolds et al.(26Reynolds L.J. Hughes L.L. Yu L. Dennis E.A. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 217: 25-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Pancreatic PLA2 obtained from both Sigma and Boehringer Mannheim stimulated the release of secretin from STC-1 cells. However, upon reverse phase HPLC they were resolved into several components. As shown in Fig.1 A, Sigma PLA2 was resolved into more than 11 peaks. Of the 11 major peaks designated according to the order of their retention time, Peaks 1, 5, 6, 9, 10, and 11 were devoid of secretin-releasing activity, while Peaks 2, 3, 4, 7, and 8 contained various secretin-releasing activities. As shown in Fig. 1 B, Boehringer Mannheim PLA2 was less heterogeneous but was still resolved into four major peaks. Of these, Peaks 2 and 4 had the same retention time as those of the corresponding peaks derived from Sigma PLA2; whereas Peaks 3a and 5a were eluted ahead of Peaks 3 and 5, respectively. Although Peak 4 was broad in Fig. 1 B, it was eluted as a single peak upon rechromatography. These four peaks were also active to stimulate secretin release. All the bioactive peaks from both sources except for Peak 8 were purified to homogeneity by rechromatography. As examples, using the same gradient of 34–54% solvent B at a rate of 0.4%/min as shown in Fig. 2, Peak 2 was purified as a single peak at 18.1 min, Peak 3 at 20.5 min, Peak 4 at 21.6 min, and Peak 7 at 36.1 min, respectively.Figure 2Purification of Sigma porcine pancreatic PLA2 peaks by rechromatography. Peaks 2, 3, 4, and 7 of Sigma pancreatic PLA2 were rechromatographed by using the same gradient of 34–54% solvent B at 0.4%/min. The tracings fromtop to bottom represent the chromatograms of Peaks 2, 3, 4, and 7, respectively. The number next to each peak denotes the elution time of the peak.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The purified peaks were analyzed for molecular mass, PLA2 activity, and secretin-releasing activity in STC-1 cells. As summarized in Table I, Peaks 2 and 4 from both sources had the highest secretin-releasing and enzymatic activities. Their molecular masses were 13,969–14,001 Da, which were the same within experimental error as 13,982 Da calculated from the amino acid sequence of porcine pancreatic PLA2(27de Geus P. van den Bergh C.J. Kuipers O. Verheij H.M. Hoekstra W.P.M. de Haas G.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 3743-3759Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The mass spectra of Peaks 2 and 4 are shown in Fig.3, A and B, respectively. In each spectrum, the lower m/zpeak represented the molecule of PLA2 with two net charges. The N-terminal amino acid sequences of these two peaks were determined. The results indicated that except for the blanked cycles at cystine residues, their N-terminal 30 residues were identical to that of porcine pancreatic PLA2 (TableII). Peak 5a has a molecular mass of 13,956 Da and is high in both enzymatic and secretin-releasing activities. Peaks 3 and 3a that had molecular masses lower than porcine PLA2 by 500 and 900 Da, respectively, were lower in both enzymatic activity and secretin-releasing activity than the above mentioned peaks. On the other hand, Peaks 7 and 8 with molecular masses of 8,213 and 17,503 Da, respectively, had very little enzymatic activity but had secretin-releasing activities comparable with those of Peaks 3 and 3a. It should be mentioned that the calculated PLA2 activities of these two peaks were not significantly different from the variation observed in the substrate blank of the enzyme assay. In addition, the mass spectrum of Peak 8 also indicated the presence of a minor component (about 15%) with molecular mass of 17,035 Da.Table IProperties of purified PLA2 peaks with secretin-releasing activityPeak #RTM rPLA2 activitySR activity1Stimulation of secretin-like immunoreactivity release at 0.1 μm in percentage over the basal.minunits/mg% stimulationSigma PLA2(n = 8)232.313,9793.96374 ± 49334.513,0361.35143 ± 31435.813,9695.91320 ± 47755.68,2130.30162 ± 20859.917,5031Contained a minor component of 17,035 Da.0.25123 ± 17BM PLA2(n = 6)232.314,0014.08283 ± 113a33.613,4182.90151 ± 39435.413,9795.72337 ± 495a38.813,9565.31292 ± 42Porcine pancreatic PLA2 from Sigma or Boehringer Mannheim (BM) was purified as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The retention time (RT) of each peak obtained in Fig. 1, relative molecular mass, PLA2 enzymatic activity (PLA2 activity), and secretin-releasing activity (SR activity) at 0.1 μmdetermined after purification are summarized.a Stimulation of secretin-like immunoreactivity release at 0.1 μm in percentage over the basal.b Contained a minor component of 17,035 Da.

Open table in a new tab Porcine pancreatic PLA2 from Sigma or Boehringer Mannheim (BM) was purified as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The retention time (RT) of each peak obtained in Fig. 1, relative molecular mass, PLA2 enzymatic activity (PLA2 activity), and secretin-releasing activity (SR activity) at 0.1 μmdetermined after purification are summarized. Purified PLA2 Peaks 2 and 4 were subjected to sequence analysis by automated Edman degradation as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The yield of the designated amino acid residues rounded to the full picomole values are given below. All five active peaks derived from Sigma PLA2 and all four main peaks from Boehringer Mannheim exhibited concentration-dependent stimulation of secretin release in STC-1 cells. The results of these dose-response studies are shown in Fig. 4, A and B, respectively. The results shown in Fig. 4 A indicated that Peaks 2 and 4 from Sigma were more than 10 times as potent as Peaks 3, 7, and 8. Also at the same concentration of 1 μm, Peaks 2 and 4 were about two to three times as effective as the other three peaks. The half-maximal dose of Peak 2 (400 nm) was slightly higher than that of Peak 4 (100 nm). Similarly, Peaks 2 and 4 from Boehringer Mannheim were about 10–20 times as potent as Peaks 5a and 3a (Fig. 4 B). Since Peak 4 was the predominant and most potent fraction to stimulate secretin release, it was used in the subsequent studies. The effect of Peak 4 on secretin release from STC-1 cells was also time-dependent. Thus, addition of Peak 4 (0.5 μm) to STC-1 cells resulted in a continuous stimulation of secretin release for 60 min, reaching 130% increase over basal secretion at 15 min and 250% at 60 min. Although the secretin-releasing activity was highest in the fractions with the highest PLA2 enzymatic activity, stimulation of secretin release did not appear to depend on its enzymatic activity. Thus, as shown in Fig. 5, pretreatment of Peak 4 with 4-bromophenacyl bromide resulted in inhibition of its enzymatic activity by 95% (from 5.3 units/mg to 0.3 units/mg). The treated enzyme, BPB-PLA2, at 0.1 μmstimulated secretin release by 337 ± 49% over basal, which was not significantly different from 283 ± 11% stimulated by the untreated enzyme. Purified Peak 4 from Sigma also stimulated secretin release from an S cells-enriched preparation isolated from rat small intestinal mucosa. As shown in Fig.6, the purified fraction stimulated the release of secretin from isolated rat mucosal cells concentration-dependently and was more than 10 times as active as the unfractionated PLA2. We studied if any signal transduction pathway mediated the action of PLA2 on secretin release. Incubation of STC-1 cells with PLA2 did not increase cellular level of cAMP over a period of 30 min (data not shown), although the cells responded well to pituitary adenylate cyclase activating polypeptide which increased cellular cAMP level from 31.3 ± 2.1 pmol/mg of cell protein to a peak level of 94.5 ± 3.4 pmol/mg of protein at 2 min. PLA2 also did not affect the cellular content of inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate over a period of 10 min (data not shown), although the cells responded well to bombesin which increased inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate level from 5.4 ± 1.6 pmol/mg of cell protein to 51.3 ± 9.6 and 54.9 ± 12.4 pmol/mg of cell protein at 15 and 30 s, respectively. These two neuropeptides had been shown to stimulate secretin release through the generation of the corresponding second messengers (24Chang C.H. Chey W.Y. Erway B. Coy D.H. Chang T.-M. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: G190-G202Google Scholar). However, as shown in TableIII, when STC-1 cells were incubated with PLA2 in the presence of an L-type calcium ion channel blocker, diltiazem (10 μm), the stimulatory effects of PLA2 on secretin release at 50 and 500 nm were inhibited by 47%. Down-regulation of protein kinase C by pretreatment of the cells with 0.1 μm β-TPA also resulted in a significant inhibition (∼50%) of PLA2-stimulated secretin release. A similar inhibition was observed when incubation of STC-1 cells with PLA2 was carried out in the presence of 1 μm staurosporine, a protein kinase C-selective inhibitor (data not shown). Moreover, the stimulatory effects of PLA2 at these two concentrations decreased significantly (38 and 49%, respectively) after pretreatment of STC-1 cells with pertussis toxin (10 ng/ml, 10 h).Table IIIEffects of protein kinase C down-regulation, pertussis toxin, and an L-type calcium ion channel blocker on PLA2-stimulated secretin release from STC-1 cellsTreatmentnStimulation of secretin release by PLA2 at50 nm500 nm% over basal− TPA8150 ± 17384 ± 21+ TPA874 ± 13 (51)3p < 0.01 versus the control.196 ± 18 (49)3p < 0.01 versus the control.− PTX8166 ± 26360 ± 16+ PTX8103 ± 15 (38)3p < 0.05 versus the control.185 ± 13 (49)3p < 0.01 versus the control.− Diltiazem4121 ± 21355 ± 31+ Diltiazem464 ± 7 (49)3p < 0.05 versus the control.188 ± 17 (47)3p < 0.05 versus the control.STC-1 cells were preincubated with either 0.1 μm β-TPA or 10 ng/ml PTX at 37 °C for 10 h or 10 μmdiltiazem for 30 min and then incubated with or without PLA2 as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The extent of stimulation of secretin release over the corresponding control was then determined.

The data represent mean ± S.E. ofn experiments as indicated. The number in parentheses indicates percentage inhibition by each treatment as compared to the corresponding control. The result of the present study provides strong evidence that porcine pancreatic PLA2 possesses an intrinsic secretin-releasing activity. Thus, commercially available porcine pancreatic PLA2 contained several peaks of secretin-releasing activity. Among the active peaks, those with the highest enzymatic activity, the same molecular weight and N-terminal amino acid sequence as porcine pancreatic PLA2 were the most potent fractions. Among the resolved peaks, Peak 4 with the highest enzymatic activity and identical M r with PLA2 probably represented the native enzyme. Peak 2 and Peak 5a, with a slightly higher and lower M rthan Peak 4, respectively, were probably genetic variants of PLA2 with reduction of both enzymatic activity and potency of secretin-releasing activity. Peaks 3 and 3a had a significantly lower molecular weight than that of the native enzyme and about 50% enzymatic activity, and substantially decreased potency in secretin-releasing activity could be partially degraded product of PLA2 that lost a few amino acid residues. All these peaks were found to cross-react well (>10%) with an anti-PLA2serum raised against purified Peak 4 (data not shown), suggesting that they are all antigenically related to PLA2. On the other hand, the relationship between Peak 7 and PLA2 cannot be clearly discerned at present due to its lack of enzymatic activity and absence of amino acid sequence data. Peak 8 does not appear to be related to the enzyme as it lacked enzymatic activity, and both its major and minor components had relative molecular masses greater than that of prepro-PLA2 (16,278.5 Da), calculated from the amino acid sequence deduced from the cDNA coding sequence of porcine PLA2 precursor (27de Geus P. van den Bergh C.J. Kuipers O. Verheij H.M. Hoekstra W.P.M. de Haas G.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 3743-3759Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Moreover, both of these peaks did not appear to contain the antigenic determinant of PLA2, since they had very low cross-reaction with the anti-PLA2 serum (<0.2%) that could be due to a small contamination of the enzyme. The effect of PLA2 on secretin release does not appear to depend on its enzymatic activity, as inactivation of the enzymatic activity with 4-bromophenacyl bromide did not diminish its secretin-releasing activity. This observation suggested that the release of secretin elicited by PLA2 was not due to membrane damage and leakage of the hormone nor due to enzymatic release of fatty acids that are known to be stimulants of secretin release (25Chang T.-M. Chey W.Y. Dig. Dis. Sci. 1980; 25: 529-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The fact that we did not observe any increase in trypan blue inclusion after treatment of STC-1 cell with PLA2 (data not shown) appeared to support the former argument. Since PLA2also stimulated the release of secretin from rat mucosal cells, this secretory response to PLA2 apparently is a common property of secretin-producing cells rather than a result of tumorigenic transformation. The results of recent studies have revealed that pancreatic PLA2 is also present in other organs, including the spleen, lung, kidney, small and large intestine, and stomach (6Matsuda Y. Ogawa M.

In addition to function as a digestive enzyme, pancreatic PLA2has also been shown to regulate cellular function, including cell proliferation (10Hanasaki K. Arita H. J. Biol.

Endocrinology. 1994; 135: 603-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Many of these actions of pancreatic PLA2 have been shown to occur through mediation by a specific receptor independent of its enzymatic activity. Moreover, specific receptor for PLA2has been cloned (14Ishizaki J. Hanasaki K. Higashino K. Kishino J. Kikuchi N. Ohara O. Arita H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5897-5904Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Lambeau G. Ancian P. Barhanin J. Lazdunski M. J. Biol.

Chem. 1995; 270: 5534-5540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). It is likely that PLA2stimulates secretin release through a similar receptor. In the present study we have also observed that stimulation of secretin release by PLA2 from STC-1 cells is partially inhibited by PTX, anL-type Ca2+ channel blocker, and by down-regulation of protein kinase C activity or a protein kinase C inhibitor. These observations suggest that the action of PLA2 on secretin release may be mediated in part by activation of a PTX-sensitive G protein, the L-type Ca2+ channel and protein kinase C. However, the relationships among these three elements of signal cascade remain to be studied. It should be noted that the release of both secretin and cholecystokinin (CCK) from the upper small intestinal mucosa is subject to feedback inhibition by pancreatic juice (29Shiratori K. Chen Y.F. Chey W.Y. Lee K.Y Chang T.-M. Gastroenterology. 1986; 91: 1171-1178Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 30Sun G. Lee K.Y. Chang T.-M. Chey W.Y.

Guan D. Liddle R.A. Green G.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 257: G175-G181PubMed Google Scholar). This effect has been shown to be due to inactivation of the corresponding lumenal releasing factors for these hormones by pancreatic proteases. Indeed, two lumenally active CCK-releasing factors, lumenal CCK-releasing factor and diazepam-binding inhibitor, have been isolated and shown to release CCK when given to the intestinal lumen (33Spannagel A.W. Green G.M. Guan D. Liddle R.A. Faull K. Reeve Jr., J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4415-4420Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 34Herzig K.H. Schön I. Tatemoto K. Ohe Y. Li Y. Fölsch U.R. Owyang C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7927-7932Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). In addition, another CCK-releasing factor, monitor peptide, which is a variant form of pancreatic Kazal-type trypsin inhibitor, has been isolated from rat pancreatic juice (35Iwai K. Fukuoka S. Fushiki T. Tsujikawa M. Hirose M. Tsunasawa S. Sakiyama F. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 8956-8959Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, it is not surprising that another protein from the pancreatic juice, PLA2, is found to have secretin-releasing activity. Indeed, we have found recently that, in conscious dogs, intraduodenal administration of fresh canine pancreatic juice in the interdigestive state resulted in a significant increase in pancreatic secretion of fluid and bicarbonate as well as plasma secretin concentration (36Song Y. Li P. Lee K.Y. Chang T.-M. Chey W.Y. Gastroenterology. 1997; 112: A483Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Although more studies are needed to define its possible physiological role on the release of secretin and pancreatic secretion, pancreatic PLA2 in the duodenal lumen may exert a stimulatory action on pancreatic secretion of fluid and bicarbonate in the interdigestive or the fasting state by releasing secretin from the duodenum. This contention is supported by the observation that intravenous administration of a polyclonal antibody specific for PLA2 (Peak 4 of the present study) resulted in marked inhibition of pancreatic exocrine secretion of fluid and bicarbonate and the release of secretin in response to duodenal acidification in rats (37Li P. Chang T.-M. Chey W.Y. Pancreas. 1998; 17: 445Google Scholar). In addition, when the duodenal acid perfusate, which contains a secretin-releasing factor activity (18Li P. Lee K.Y. Chang T.-M. Chey W.Y. J. Clin. Invest. 1990; 86: 1474-1479Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), was collected from donor rats, preincubated with the anti-PLA2 antibody and then ultrafiltrated to remove the antibody-antigen complex, the secretin-releasing factor activity in the filtrate disappeared (37Li P. Chang T.-M. Chey W.Y. Pancreas. 1998; 17: 445Google Scholar). These observations suggest that PLA2 is released from the upper small intestinal mucosa to mediate the release of secretin in response to duodenal acidification. Thus, given that pancreatic PLA2 is secreted into the intestinal lumen and present in the gastrointestinal mucosa, it is tempting to speculated that the enzyme may also participate in a regulatory function in the release of other gut hormones.

Sulfurylase activity was significantly destabilized in a time-dependent manner in the rearranged proteins as well.

ATP+SO42−→APS+PPiAPS+ATP→ADP+PAPSReaction 1 We have studied the PAPS-synthesizing enzymes in the context of a defect in the production of PAPS in the brachymorphic mutant mouse where a severe reduction in the kinase activity and a partial reduction in the sulfurylase activity was demonstrated (1Sugahara K.

To understand this intriguing double enzyme defect, the relationship between the two activities was investigated by determining whether they represented two separate polypeptides or a single bifunctional polypeptide. The two sulfate-activating enzymes, ATP-sulfurylase and APS kinase, were purified from rat chondrosarcoma and shown to have nearly identical molecular properties and fractionation behavior (4Geller D. Henry J.G. Belch J. Schwartz N.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 7374-7382Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To distinguish whether a single polypeptide with multiple active sites or two tightly complexed polypeptides pertain, characterization of both kinetic mechanisms (5Lyle S. Geller D.H. Ng K. Stanczak J. Westley J. Schwartz N.B. Biochem. J. 1994; 301: 355-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 6Lyle S. Geller D.H. Ng K. Westley J. Schwartz N.B. Biochem.

Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5920-5925Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). These studies identified the mammalian sulfurylase/kinase as a bifunctional enzyme (7Lyle S. Stanczak J. Ng K. Schwartz N.B. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5920-5925Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) that uses a channeling mechanism to transfer the intermediate APS efficiently from the sulfurylase to the kinase active site (8Lyle S.

Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 940-945Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Subsequently, the murine and human sulfurylase/kinase have been cloned, sequenced, and expressed as a fused bifunctional enzyme (10Li H. Deyrup A. Mensch Jr., J.R. Domowicz M. Konstantinidis A.

The finding of multiple functions on a single polypeptide suggests that this complex enzyme is a critical locus for regulation and a vulnerable site for mutations.The expressed 624-amino acid murine ATP-sulfurylase/APS kinase has an amino-terminal region (residues 1–199) that is highly homologous to known APS kinases and a carboxyl-terminal region (residues 237–624) that is similar to known ATP-sulfurylases (10Li H.

These two domains are joined by a 37-amino acid intervening sequence (linker region) (10Li H. Deyrup A. Mensch Jr., J.R. Domowicz M. Konstantinidis A. Schwartz N.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29453-29459Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). This arrangement in which the kinase domain is positioned at the NH2 terminus of the bifunctional enzyme whereas the sulfurylase domain is toward the COOH terminus is maintained in the human (11.Deyrup, A.

Vogt T.F. Suo Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10405-10410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the structural order of the protein product in Penicillium chrysogenumwhere the sulfurylase has a partial kinase-like sequence fused at the COOH terminus (15Foster B.A. Thomas S.M.

Chem. 1994; 269: 19777-19786Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).The number of examples of single polypeptides that carry out multiple functions is increasing, and it has been suggested that such multifunctional enzymes have selective advantages over separate monofunctional counterparts. In some cases, benefits of bifunctionality such as improved regulation (16Kirschner K. Lane A.N. Strasser A.W. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 472-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 17Brzovic P.S. Ngo K. Dunn M.F. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 3831-3839Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) and enhanced stability (18Yablonski M. Pasek D. Han B. Jones M. Traut T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10704-10708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) have been demonstrated. A fused sulfurylase/kinase that uses a kinetically channeled mechanism may offer advantages in overcoming obstacles inherent to the sulfate activation pathway. For instance, APS is both spontaneously labile, resulting in nonenzymatic degradation to AMP and free sulfate, and subject to breakdown by cytosolic sulfohydrolase/sulfatase activities if released into the medium (19Stokes A.M. Denner W.H. Rose F.A. Dodgson K.S. Biochim . Biophys. Acta. 1973; 302: 64-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The unusually high equilibrium constant (>108) for the reverse sulfurylase reaction (toward ATP formation) implies that even in the presence of associated pyrophosphatases, APS must be phosphorylated to PAPS (which is not a substrate for ATP-sulfurylase), or it will be redirected in the reverse sulfurylase reaction. Thus a channeling bifunctional protein may shift the equilibrium of the reversible sulfurylase reaction in a favorable way or protect the APS intermediate from degradative effects of the solvent.The availability of cloned and expressed sulfurylase/kinase allows us to address the question of the relationship of the bifunctional sulfurylase/kinase domains to monofunctional ATP-sulfurylases and ATP kinases and whether there is a distinct mechanistic or structural advantage to a fused protein. To examine the ability of the kinase and sulfurylase domains to function independently (as occurs in plants, fungi, and bacteria), we have generated and expressed a series of constructs that encode independent monofunctional domains. The importance of the domain order and organization was examined through the construction of several mutants in which the order of the two active domains was reversed or altered in relation to each other or to the linker region. The critical role of the linker region was then established by construction of recombinants in which the linker region was deleted or rearranged in relation to the two active domains.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESRestriction enzymes were obtained from New England Biolabs, unless otherwise indicated. T4 polynucleotide kinase was from Promega, Amplitaq was from Perkin Elmer-Cetus, DNA polymerase and associated reagents for automated sequencing were from Applied Biosystems, nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid alkaline phosphatase conjugate used for Western blot analysis was from Qiagen. Pfu DNA polymerase and cloning vector pBluescript were obtained from Stratagene. The pCR 2.1 vector for direct ligation of polymerase chain reaction products was a component of the Invitrogen TA cloning kit. Thrombin protease for removal of the histidine tag, the pET-15b bacterial expression vector and metal chelate resin for gravity purification of the expressed protein were purchased from Novagen. All enzymes were used with the buffers recommended by the suppliers. Determination of protein concentration was done using the Bio-Rad protein assay and the Pierce BCA protein assay systems.Polymerase Chain Reaction and SequencingPolymerase chain reactions were performed in a Perkin Elmer GeneAmp 2400 thermal cycler using either Taq polymerase from Perkin Elmer orPfu polymerase from Stratagene. Standard cycling parameters included 1–5 min of preincubation at 94 °C followed by twenty cycles of 1 min at 94 °C, 1 min at 60 °C, and 1 min at 72 °C. Following the cycling step, a 10-min extension step at 72 °C allowed completion of all unfinished transcripts. All oligonucleotides were purchased from the University of Chicago oligonucleotide core facility. Automated DNA sequencing was performed on an ABI PRISM 377 DNA sequencer.Expression and Purification of Separate Enzyme DomainsThree constructs corresponding to the APS kinase region were designed: APS kinase alone (1MAPSK) (amino acid residues 1–199); APS kinase plus linker (APSKL) (residues 1–236); and finally, APS kinase plus linker and an extension into the ATP-sulfurylase region (APSK456) (residues 1–456). The latter primer (N9) was intended to introduce a TAA stop codon following Gly-456 of the sulfurylase region, but in fact altered the reading frame so that translation ran on into the downstream vector sequence, adding a 24-residue heterologous peptide sequence (NSRIRLLTKPERKLSWLLPPLSNN) to the COOH terminus of the APSK456 construct. A fourth APS kinase expression construct (APSK257) arose spontaneously during the creation of a site-directed mutant; deletion of a single nucleotide at residue 257 caused a frameshift resulting in substitution of a proline for an alanine followed by a termination codon. In addition, three ATP-sulfurylase constructs were designed corresponding to the ATP-sulfurylase domain alone (ATPS) (residues 237–624); ATP-sulfurylase plus linker (LATPS) (residues 200–624); and ATP-sulfurylase with an NH2-terminal extension into the kinase region (3MSK) (residues 70–624).Plasmid pET-15bSK1 containing the coding region for the sulfurylase/kinase was used as a polymerase chain reaction template for generation of inserts. Primers were synthesized that contained restriction enzyme cutting sites to facilitate post-amplification ligation of products into the pET-15b expression vector. The sites chosen, NdeI and XhoI, do not occur in the sulfurylase/kinase coding sequence. The amino acids Gly-Ser-His were added to the amino terminus of all constructs by vector sequences, and an additional artificial Met was added at the amino end of all constructs except 1MAPSK, APSKL, APSK456, and 3MSK.The Novagen pET-15b vector was used for bacterial expression of the separate enzyme domains. This plasmid provides elements needed for translation in E. coli as well as His-Tag and thrombin digestion site coding sequences to facilitate purification of the expressed proteins. Amplified fragments were doubly digested withNdeI and XhoI and ligated into the likewise digested vector. Recovered cloned inserts were sequenced in their entirety before transformation into JM109 DE3 cells by the CaCl2 method.Protein expression and purification were accomplished as described previously (16Kirschner K. Lane A.N. Strasser A.W. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 472-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Briefly, isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to overnight bacterial cultures and incubation was continued for 3–4 h at 37 °C with shaking. Cells were pelleted and sonicated in IMAC 5 buffer (5 mm imidazole, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.9). Following removal of cellular debris by ultracentrifugation, the soluble protein fraction was diluted 1:2 in IMAC 5 sonication buffer and loaded onto a His-bind column from Novagen according to the supplier's protocol. Following incubation at 4 °C for 20 min with intermittent mixing, the flowthrough was collected, and the column was washed with 30 mm imidazole in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.9, to remove the majority of nonspecifically bound bacterial proteins, after which the expressed protein was eluted with 400 mm imidazole in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.9. The purified protein was dialyzed into phosphate buffer (25 mmNaH2PO4/K2HPO4, pH 7.8, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA) overnight in preparation for enzymatic assays.Western Blot AnalysisA nickel nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni-NTA) alkaline phosphatase conjugate was used to detect the His-tagged expressed protein on Western blots. Briefly, the purified protein was electrophoresed in a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was blocked in 3% bovine serum albumin in TBS (150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4) buffer overnight and then washed three times in TBST (500 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5) buffer. The blot was then incubated with the Ni-NTA alkaline phosphatase conjugate at a 1:500 dilution in TBST buffer for 2 h and washed as before. The protein band was visualized using nitro blue tetrazolium/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate in a Tris buffer (100 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9.5) followed by a 10% trichloroacetic acid wash and storage in H2O.Generation of Rearranged Mutant ProteinsBoth the ATPS/APSK and ATPS/APSK/L constructs were created from the normal S/K cDNA clone using the methodology of Ali and Steinkasserer (21Ali S.A. Steinkasserer A. BioTechniques. 1995; 18: 746-750PubMed Google Scholar). For the former, the APS kinase region was amplified with a 5′ primer (SW1), which had no restriction site, and a 3′ primer (N5), which included aXhoI site, whereas the ATP-sulfurylase region was amplified with a 5′ primer with an NdeI site (N6) but a 3′ primer without a restriction site using Vent DNA polymerase. Following gel purification of the two bands, the blunt-ended DNA fragments were phosphorylated for 30 min at 37 °C and then ligated for 15 min at room temperature in a 10-μl reaction. 1 μl of the ligation reaction was then re-amplified using the former internal primers (N5 and N6). An additional amplification step was required in the construction of the ATPS/APSK/L mutant. The ATPS/L/APSK construct was generated through polymerase chain reaction incorporation of restriction sites 5′ and 3′ to each domain (APSK, ATPS, and linker) followed by digestion and ligation of the respective half-sites to give the desired order. AnEcoRI site was inserted between the sulfurylase and linker sequence, causing insertion of the dipeptide Glu-Phe. Similarly, aXbaI site was introduced between the linker and kinase, inserting the dipeptide Ser-Arg.Enzyme AssaysThe optimal protein amount for assessing enzymatic activity was found to be between 0.25 and 1.0 μg. Following gravity column purification, the protein concentration was determined using the Pierce BCA protein assay, and the preparation was diluted with phosphate buffer to a stock concentration of 20 μg/ml for use in all three assays. All assays were completed a minimum of three times; a representative single data set is presented.The ATP-sulfurylase assay is performed in the reverse of the physiological direction of ATP formation as described (18Yablonski M. Pasek D. Han B. Jones M. Traut T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10704-10708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) because of the unfavorable K eq of the forward reaction. Standard sulfurylase assays contained 50 mmNaH2PO4/K2HPO4 (pH 7.8), 12 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mmdithiothreitol, 5 mm NaF, 0.2 mmNa4P2O7 (containing 6.7 mCi of32P), 0.1 mm APS, and 50 μl of enzyme preparation in a total volume of 1.0 ml.The standard kinase assay contained 80 nm[35S]APS, 0.5 mm ATP (pH 7.0), 5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm ammonium sulfate, and 13 μl of enzyme and was brought up to 25 μl with buffer A (25 mm NaH2PO4/K2HPO4, pH 7.8, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, and 10% glycerol) (6Lyle S. Geller D.H. Ng K. Westley J. Schwartz N.B. Biochem. J. 1994; 301: 349-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Conversion of the labeled APS substrate to PAPS is monitored by paper electrophoresis, which separates the two charged species.Paper electrophoresis is also employed in the standard coupled assay, which tests the overall reaction with ATP and sulfate as substrates, measuring the yields of APS and PAPS. The standard overall reaction (25 μl) contained 0.4 mm[35S]H2SO4, 10 mmATP, 20 mm MgCl2, 22 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), and 15 μl of enzyme preparation (6Lyle S. Geller D.H. Ng K. Westley J. Schwartz N.B. Biochem. J. 1994; 301: 349-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). This assay is valuable not only as a measure of the ability of the enzyme to synthesize PAPS from ATP and SO42−, but also as an assay of the forward sulfurylase reaction.Kinetic parameters were obtained as described (5Lyle S. Geller D.H. Ng K. Stanczak J. Westley J. Schwartz N.B. Biochem. J. 1994; 301: 355-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 6Lyle S. Geller D.H. Ng K. Westley J. Schwartz N.B. Biochem. J. 1994; 301: 349-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). For the forward sulfurylase, K mATP andK msulfate were found to be 350 and 37 μm, respectively, for 1MSK and 147 and 77 μm, respectively, for LATPS. Data from experiments in the physiologically reverse direction yieldedK mAPS andK mpyrophosphate of 2.3 and 32 μm, respectively, for 1MSK and 138 and 12, respectively, for LATPS. For APS-kinase, KmAPS and KmATP were found to be 88 nm and 6.2 μm, respectively, for 1MSK and 960 nm and 41 μm, respectively, for APSKL.Thermal Stability ExperimentsDetermination of the stability of the various recombinant forms of enzyme was performed by assaying sulfurylase and kinase activity after incubation of 100-μl aliquots of the various enzymes at 25 or 37 °C for various lengths of time up to a maximum incubation period of 2 h. Activities were monitored by assay procedures as described.DISCUSSIONThe ability of individual domains of some multifunctional enzymes to function independently has recently received increasing attention (18Yablonski M. Pasek D. Han B. Jones M. Traut T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10704-10708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 22Beaucamp N. Hofmann A. Kellerer B. Jaenicke R. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 2159-2165Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In the case of murine ATP-sulfurylase/APS kinase we have shown that the native bifunctional enzyme, which possesses both sulfurylase and kinase activities, efficiently converts all APS synthesized into PAPS (7Lyle S. Stanczak J. Ng K. Schwartz N.B. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5920-5925Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 10Li H. Deyrup A. Mensch Jr., J.R. Domowicz M. Konstantinidis A. Schwartz N.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29453-29459Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The native bifunctional enzyme has an NH2-terminal region homologous to known APS kinases and a COOH-terminal region highly homologous to known ATP-sulfurylases (10Li H. Deyrup A. Mensch Jr., J.R. Domowicz M. Konstantinidis A. Schwartz N.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29453-29459Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). To understand the selective advantages of the bifunctional enzyme over expressed monofunctional domains, we engineered segments of sulfurylase/kinase to produce the two individual enzyme activities on separately expressed polypeptides.The ability of the ATP-sulfurylase domain alone to catalyze the sulfurylase reaction in both the forward and reverse directions was the first evidence that the bifunctional enzyme can be divided into active fragments containing each enzyme activity. Although a construct encoding the APS kinase domain-only (1MAPSK) was inactive for kinase activity, addition of the 37-residue linker region to the COOH-terminal end of the kinase polypeptide (APSKL) restored kinase activity. However, the importance of this sequence to kinase activity cannot be attributed a priori to a catalytic or structural role, because it is possible that the APSK polypeptide is incapable of proper folding and is therefore inactive. These results do however indicate that fusion of the two activities does not preclude their ability to function independently. Furthermore, isolation of the two enzyme activities on individual polypeptides and the ability of each domain to function separately implies that each domain must have the independent ability to bind ATP and APS.Because we could construct monofunctional units that express each activity, it was of interest to determine whether they could act in a coupled reaction to synthesize PAPS, when mixed in solution. Assays of such mixtures showed that although 1MAPSK and ATPS together had no appreciable kinase or overall activity, a mixture of APSKL and ATPS displayed kinase activity and overall synthesis of PAPS comparable to those of the intact enzyme (Fig. 3). In these mixing experiments, the amount of PAPS synthesized increased when the amount of one enzyme (APSKL or ATPS) was held constant, and the other (ATPS or APSKL) was increased. Thus it appears that the APS intermediate is efficiently transferred between the two separate polypeptides. Future experiments using isotope dilution and enrichment will examine the ability of such mixtures to exhibit either efficient coupling like the separate fungal enzymes or channeling as demonstrated by the bifunctional rat chondrosarcoma enzyme (8Lyle S. Ozeran J.D. Stanczak J. Westley J. Schwartz N.B. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6822-6827Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar).Preliminary kinetic data suggest that there are modest differences in binding of the substrates, ATP and free sulfate and the product, pyrophosphate, to the sulfurylase portion of the enzyme in 1MSK and the ATPS mutant, whereas the binding of APS is significantly different. Tighter binding of APS in the native enzyme, 1MSK, may be a reflection of the native enzyme to not release the APS intermediate into the medium and instead transfer it directly to the active site of the kinase portion of the enzyme. But because APS is the product that is released from the individual ATPS enzyme, its binding efficiency is lower. There is also a significant difference in the binding of the APS intermediate to the kinase portion of 1MSK compared with the monofunctional APSKL. These data would suggest that a covalent linkage between the two domains leads to a significant perturbation in apparent binding affinities without much effect on catalytic efficiency. Detailed kinetic analyses are underway to investigate these mechanistic aspects.The results obtained from the rearranged structural mutants, ATPS/L/APSK, ATPS/APSK, APSK/ATPS, and ATPS/APSK/L are particularly interesting. For instance, the inability of the first three of these constructs to catalyze the sulfurylase reaction is difficult to interpret, especially considering the fact that the individual sulfurylase domain is capable of functioning independently, and that the fourth rearranged mutant, ATPS/APSK/L, exhibited normal sulfurylase activity comparable to that of the wild type. These results will become more comprehensible when the results of the stability experiments are considered.The inability of the APS kinase domain to function without a linker region at its COOH terminus correlates with the inability of the ATPS/APSK and ATPS/L/APSK mutants to form PAPS (<10% of the wild type enzyme). These results imply either that the linker region is needed for kinase activity in addition to its positional specificity,i.e. the linker must be present at the COOH-terminal end of the kinase domain, or that the alteration of the sequence disrupts the kinase activity caused by improper folding. The later argument can be discounted based on the result of the third construct, APSK/ATPS. This construct, although not demonstrating normal kinase activity, did show about 25% of the kinase activity of the wild type. The partial preservation of kinase activity in this recombinant may be caused by the extension of the COOH-terminal region of the kinase domain by additional sulfurylase amino acid sequence. Interestingly when the linker sequence is aligned with the ATPS sequence (Fig.4) there is a region toward the NH2 terminus of the ATPS sequence (residues 290–318 in the ATPS sequence) that is similar to the linker (23.3% identity in 30-amino acid overlap) and may be responsible for the part"

Differential regulation of Sertoli cells by germ cells has been studied by examining the effects pachytene spermatocytes or round spermatids have on Sertoli cells. A 24.5-kDa protein, homologous to phosphatidylethanolamine-binding protein, produced by cultured round spermatids stimulates the secretion of proteins from Sertoli cells, suggesting that the phosphatidylethanolamine-binding protein participates in the negative regulation of Sertoli cell secretory function during spermatogenesis (49Onoda M. Djakiew D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 197: 688-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Soluble protein(s) from pachytene spermatocytes stimulate ceruloplasmin, transferrin, and sulfated glycoprotein 1 and 2 in Sertoli cells (50Onoda M. Djakiew D. In Vitro Cell Dev.

Clearly, interactions between somatic and germ cells lead to the induction of factors that selectively up- or down-regulate gene expression in recipient cells. We have previously shown that several genes including an isoform of casein kinase, an epidermal growth factor, a statin-related protein and an integral membrane glycoprotein are up-regulated and a basic fibroblast growth factor, fibronectin, an endoplasmic reticulum stress protein and a pro-α2(XI) collagen are down-regulated when Sertoli cells are co-cultured with a mixed population of germ cells (51Syed V. Hecht N.B. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 1997; 47: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Here we begin to define the molecular mechanisms regulating cellular interactions between Sertoli cells and specific populations of meiotic or post-meiotic male germ cells. We demonstrate that a von Ebner's-like protein and the Huntington disease protein are up-regulated in male germ cells by soluble factors secreted by Sertoli cells. Primary cultures of Sertoli cells were prepared from 20-day-old Sprague-Dawley rats (Charles River, Kingston, MA) by sequential enzymatic treatments as described previously (51Syed V. Hecht N.B. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 1997; 47: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 52Syed V. Gu W. Hecht N.B. J. Androl. 1997; 18: 264-273PubMed Google Scholar, 53Syed V. Hecht N.B. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 3503-3511Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The testes were decapsulated and digested with trypsin (1 mg/ml, Sigma) for 30 min at 37 °C to remove interstitial cells and then with collagenase (1 mg/ml, Sigma) for 25 min at 37 °C. The cell suspensions were centrifuged at 800 rpm for 2 min. The supernatants, containing peritubular cells, were discarded. The pellets were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated in phosphate-buffered saline containing hyaluronidase (1 mg/ml, Sigma) for 30 min at 37 °C. After incubation, the cell suspensions were centrifuged at 800 rpm and the pellets were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline. The resulting Sertoli cells were plated at a density of 2 × 106/cm2 in polystyrene γ-irradiated Petri dishes (Falcon, Oxnard, CA) in serum-free Ham's F-12 and Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD) supplemented with 10 μg/ml insulin (Sigma), 5 μg/ml transferrin (Sigma), and 4 μg/ml gentamycin (Life Technologies, Inc.). Cells were maintained in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2 at 32 °C. To obtain Sertoli cells with a purity greater than 97%, cultures were hypotonically shocked with 20 mm Tris (pH 7.4) 48 h after plating to lyse contaminating germ cells, and then washed twice with culture medium. Twenty-four hours later, germ cells were added to the cultured Sertoli cells for different time periods as described. Germ cells were obtained from the testes of 60-day-old rats. The testes were decapsulated and incubated with collagenase (1 mg/ml) for 15 min at 37 °C. After the seminiferous tubules settled, interstitial cells were removed by decanting the supernatant. The seminiferous tubules were incubated with trypsin (1 mg/ml) for 20 min at 37 °C, pipetted up and down several times to obtain a single cell suspension, and filtered through 20-μm nylon mesh. Enriched populations of germ cells were obtained from adult rat testes by Staput sedimentation as described previously (53Syed V. Hecht N.B. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 3503-3511Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Staput cell separations were performed in bovine serum albumin gradients (2–4%) in culture medium adjusted to pH 7.4. The cells were allowed to sediment for 3.5 h, fractions were collected, and cells were identified by microscopy. Sertoli cells (2 × 106) from 20-day-old rats were co-cultured with pachytene spermatocytes (8 × 106) or round spermatids (8 × 106) for 24 h. Germ cells were cultured in medium supplemented with 2 mm sodium pyruvate and 6 mmdl-lactate at a density of 8 × 106/ml. At the end of culture, cells were scraped from the plates and RNA was extracted. To study the time-dependent expression and cellular sites of the induced genes, Sertoli cells were co-cultured with pachytene spermatocytes or round spermatids for 2, 4, 8, 18, and 24 h. At the termination of each culture, the germ cells were removed from Sertoli cells by aggressive washing. Total RNAs were extracted from Sertoli cell-germ cell co-cultures and from separated Sertoli cells and germ cells with the RNAgents Kit (Promega, Madison, WI). Throughout the cultures, cell viability, monitored by trypan blue exclusion, revealed greater than 97% viability. To delineate whether secreted factors induced mRNAs, the germ cells and Sertoli cells were cultured separately for 24 h and the media were collected. The media collected from Sertoli cells were added to germ cells and the media from germ cells were added to Sertoli cells. The Sertoli and germ cells were then cultured for 24 h and collected for RNA extraction. To start to characterize the factor(s) up-regulating genes in co-culture, conditioned media from germ cells or Sertoli cells were collected after 24 h of culture (35Le Magueresse B. Jegou B. Mol.

The media were boiled for 10 min, frozen and thawed five times, or passed through Ultrafree-15 columns (Sigma) containing Biomax membranes with a molecular weight cut-off limit of 10 kDa. Germ cells were cultured with media prepared from Sertoli cells and Sertoli cells were cultured with media prepared from germ cells treated as described above. After 24 h, the cells were collected for RNA extraction. Preparation of total RNA from Sertoli cells, from co-cultures of Sertoli cells with pachytene spermatocytes, or round spermatids, pachytene spermatocytes, and round spermatids were extracted as described previously (54Alcivar A.A. Hake L.E. Millette C.F. Trasler J.M. Hecht N.B. Dev. Biol. 1989; 135: 263-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The mRNA differential display was performed as described earlier (51Syed V. Hecht N.B. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 1997; 47: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 52Syed V. Gu W. Hecht N.B. J. Androl. 1997; 18: 264-273PubMed Google Scholar, 53Syed V. Hecht N.B.

Aliquots of total RNA (400 ng) were reverse-transcribed with 300 units of reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD) in a buffer containing 250 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 375 mm KCl, 15 mm MgCl2, 10 μm dithiothreitol, 1 μm anchor primer (Operon, Alameda, CA), and 5 μm each of dATP, dCTP, dGTP, and dTTP for 60 min at 42 °C. After inactivating the reverse transcriptase, 2 μl of reverse-transcribed reaction mixtures were added to 18 μl of PCR 1The abbreviations used are: PCR, polymerase chain reaction; kb, kilobase(s).buffer containing 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 500 mm KCl, 1.5 mm of MgCl2, 2 μm of each dATP, dCTP, dGTP and dTTP, 1 μl of anchor primer, 10 μCi of [35S]dATP, and 1 unit ofTaq polymerase (Perkin Elmer, Norwalk, CT). The cycling parameters for PCR were 95 °C for 30 s, 42 °C for 2 min, and 72 °C for 30 s, followed by 72 °C for 5 min. The radiolabeled cDNAs were electrophoresed in 6% denaturing polyacrylamide gels and after drying, the gels were exposed to x-ray films. cDNA bands that were reproducibly detected in multiple preparations and in multiple differential displays were excised from the gels and extracted in a 0.3m ammonium acetate solution containing 1% SDS and 5 μg of tRNA. The cDNAs were precipitated by the addition of 3m sodium acetate (pH 5.2) and 1 ml of 100% ethanol, resuspended in 10 μl of water and amplified by PCR using the same reaction conditions as described above. The PCR amplified fragments were ligated into the PCR-II vector of the TA cloning kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. Plasmids were prepared by the QIAprep, Miniprep Kit (Qiagen, Santa Clarita, CA). Both strands of each cDNA were sequenced using M13 and T7 primers. The sequences of the isolated clones were compared with the GenBank and EMBL data bases. Plasmid DNAs (10 μg) were digested with EcoRI and the cDNA inserts were separated from the vector by electrophoresis on 1% agarose gels. The insert bands were excised from the gels and purified with the Sephaglas Band Prep Kit (Pharmacia Biotech Inc., Piscataway, NJ). Approximately 25 ng of cDNAs were radiolabeled with 50 μCi of [α-32P]dCTP (NEN Life Science Products Inc.) and the random primer labeling system (Life Technologies Inc.). Unincorporated dNTPs were removed by centrifugation through Chroma-Spin columns (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) and the probes were denatured at 100 °C for 5 min immediately before hybridization. Northern blot analysis was performed with GeneScreen membranes (NEN Life Science Products Inc.) as described earlier (51Syed V. Hecht N.B. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 1997; 47: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 52Syed V. Gu W. Hecht N.B. J. Androl. 1997; 18: 264-273PubMed Google Scholar, 53Syed V. Hecht N.B.

Equal amounts of RNA (10 μg) were hybridized and after hybridization, the blots were stripped, and rehybridized with an actin cDNA to monitor for equal RNA loading and transfer. To define genes whose expression is induced by cell-cell interactions of specific germ cells and Sertoli cells, we have co-cultured rat Sertoli cells and pachytene spermatocytes or round spermatids. Using mRNA differential display, two cDNAs were detected with RNAs isolated from co-cultures that were not detectable in equivalent RNA preparations from separate cultures of Sertoli cells, pachytene spermatocytes, or round spermatids. Both genes, up-regulated in germ cells, will be discussed in turn. A cDNA of 660 nucleotides (clone 1 in Fig.1) was up-regulated in co-cultures of Sertoli cells with pachytene spermatocytes or round spermatids. It showed 87% similarity at the nucleotide level (from nucleotides 107 to 767) and a coding region amino acid similarity of 79.5% (from amino acid 18 to 178) to von Ebner's protein (Fig.2) (55Schmale H. Holtgreve-Grez H. Christiansen H. Nature. 1990; 343: 366-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The von Ebner's-like gene encodes a transcript of 1.2 kb in RNA from co-cultures or total testis, which is not detectable in RNA preparations from brain, lung, or liver confirming the selective differential display expression of this cDNA (Fig. 3 A). Although von Ebner's protein is normally expressed in salivary glands, tear glands, and prostate, we did not detect hybridization with this 660-nucleotide von Ebner's-like protein cDNA to RNA from these tissues (Fig. 4).Figure 2Amino acid sequence of clone 1. Amino acid sequence comparison of clone 1 with rat von Ebner's gland protein (GenBank accession number P20289). 159 amino acids of open reading frame of clone 1 (lower sequence) share high extent of similarity (79.5%) with amino acids 18 to 178 of the von Ebner's protein (upper sequence).

Total RNAs (10 μg) were extracted from 24-h cultures of Sertoli cells alone (SC), Sertoli cells co-cultured with pachytene spermatocytes (SC+P), Sertoli cells co-cultured with round spermatids (SC+RS), pachytene spermatocytes alone (P), round spermatids alone (RS) and from testis, brain, lung, and liver. RNAs were electrophoresed and hybridized with the cDNAs encoding the von Ebner's-like protein (A) and Huntington disease protein (B). The blots were rehybridized with an actin coding region cDNA.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Figure 4Northern blot showing selective expression of the von Ebner's-like gene. Total RNAs (10 μg) were extracted from testis, brain, prostate, lacrymal gland, salivary gland, and interstitial cells. RNAs were electrophoresed and hybridized with the cDNA encoding the von Ebner's-like protein. The blots were rehybridized with an actin coding region cDNA.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) In order to study the time dependent induction and cellular site of expression of the von Ebner's-like gene, Sertoli cells were co-cultured with pachytene spermatocytes or round spermatids for 2, 4, 8, 18, and 24 h. At the termination of culture, germ cells and Sertoli cells were separated and RNA was prepared from each. The 1.2-kb transcript was first detected in RNA from co-cultured germ cells after 4 h co-culture, but not in individual cultures of Sertoli cells, pachytene spermatocytes, or round spermatids under identical culture conditions (Fig. 5 A). Surprisingly, no mRNAs were detected in either Sertoli cells or germ cells following their disassociation after co-culture. To determine whether germ cells or Sertoli cells or both express the von Ebner's-like protein mRNA, conditioned media were prepared from germ cells and Sertoli cells. The conditioned medium from Sertoli cells induced the 1.2-kb von Ebner's-like protein mRNA in germ cells, while the germ cell-conditioned medium did not induce the mRNA in Sertoli cells, demonstrating that the germ cells are transcribing the 1.2-kb mRNA (Fig.6 A). The Sertoli cell factor(s) that induces the 1.2-kb von Ebner's-like protein mRNA in germ cells is smaller than 10 kDa and is inactivated by freezing and thawing or boiling (Fig.7 A).Figure 7Partial characterization of Sertoli cell and germ cell factor(s). Total RNAs (10 μg) were extracted from Sertoli cells co-cultured with germ cells for 24 h (SC+GC), Sertoli cells cultured with germ cell conditioned medium (SC+GCM), Sertoli cells cultured with germ cell conditioned medium that had been passed through a Millipore Ultrafree-15 column with a 10-kDa molecular mass cut-off limit (SC+GCM >10 kd), Sertoli cells cultured with germ cell medium that had been frozen and thawed 5 times (SC+GCM F & T), Sertoli cells cultured with germ cell medium previously boiled for 10 min (SC+GCM 100 C), germ cells cultured with Sertoli cell conditioned medium (GC+SCM) germ cells cultured with Sertoli cell medium that had been passed through a Millipore Ultrafree-15 column of 10-kDa molecular mass cut-off limit (GC+SCM >10 kd), germ cells cultured with Sertoli cell medium that had been frozen and thawed 5 times (GC+SCM F & T), and germ cells cultured with Sertoli cell medium previously boiled for 10 min (GC+SCM 100 C). RNAs were electrophoresed and hybridized individually with cDNAs encoding the von Ebner's-like protein (A) and the Huntington disease gene (B). The blots were rehybridized with an actin coding region cDNA.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) A cDNA of 390 nucleotides (clone 2 in Fig. 1) was up-regulated when Sertoli cells were co-cultured with pachytene spermatocytes or round spermatids. Sequence analysis of the cDNA revealed 100% identity with nucleotides 5618 to 6008 of the Huntington disease gene. A transcript of about 10 kb was detected in RNA isolated from co-cultures of Sertoli cells and pachytene spermatocytes, from co-cultures of Sertoli cells and round spermatids or total testis, but not in RNA from Sertoli cells cultured alone, germ cells cultured alone, brain, lung, or liver (Fig. 3 B). When germ cells are separated from Sertoli cells after co-culture for 18 h or more, the transcript for the Huntington's disease gene was seen in RNA isolated from pachytene spermatocytes or round spermatids, but not from Sertoli cells (Fig. 5 B). The 10-kb transcript was also induced in germ cells with Sertoli cell-conditioned media, but not in Sertoli cells with germ cell-conditioned media (Fig. 6 B). The Sertoli cell factor(s) appears to be larger than 10 kDa and survives freezing and thawing, but is inactivated by boiling (Fig.7 B). Local secretory factors and cell to cell communication within the seminiferous tubule are essential to create and maintain microenvironments that allow the normal progression of spermatogenic events. Inappropriate or absent intratesticular signals from either germ cells or Sertoli cells may cause abnormal spermatogenesis leading to infertility. Many paracrine and autocrine factors mediate interaction between different testicular cell types (3Griswold M.D. Biol. Reprod. 1995; 25: 211-216Crossref Scopus (354) G"
