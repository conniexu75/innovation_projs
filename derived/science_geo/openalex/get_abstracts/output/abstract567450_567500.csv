https://openalex.org/W2510746232,"Patterns of gene expression can be used to characterize and classify neuronal types. It is challenging, however, to generate taxonomies that fulfill the essential criteria of being comprehensive, harmonizing with conventional classification schemes, and lacking superfluous subdivisions of genuine types. To address these challenges, we used massively parallel single-cell RNA profiling and optimized computational methods on a heterogeneous class of neurons, mouse retinal bipolar cells (BCs). From a population of ∼25,000 BCs, we derived a molecular classification that identified 15 types, including all types observed previously and two novel types, one of which has a non-canonical morphology and position. We validated the classification scheme and identified dozens of novel markers using methods that match molecular expression to cell morphology. This work provides a systematic methodology for achieving comprehensive molecular classification of neurons, identifies novel neuronal types, and uncovers transcriptional differences that distinguish types within a class."

Binding of SynGAP to PSD-95 induces phase separation of the complex, forming highly concentrated liquid-like droplets reminiscent of the PSD. The multivalent nature of the SynGAP/PSD-95 complex is critical for the phase separation to occur and for proper activity-dependent SynGAP dispersions from the PSD.

Eukaryotic cells need to orchestrate numerous biochemical reactions spatiotemporally. Nature solves this challenge, in part, by segregating each cell into multiple compartments using membrane bilayers so that specific chemical reactions can occur within each compartment. However, not all isolated cellular compartments are insulated by membranes. Especially for those undergoing rapid molecular exchanges with the surrounding environment, membranes can be a rate-limiting barrier. Membrane-lacking compartments, on the other hand, can be dynamic mesoscale reaction apparatuses localized at distinct regions of cells to fulfill spatiotemporal requirements of numerous cellular processes, such as cell growth, division, migration, and cell-cell communications. It is increasingly recognized that membrane-lacking compartments are ubiquitous and central for many cellular processes (Brangwynne, 2013Brangwynne C.P.

Some of the well-recognized examples of membrane-lacking compartments include nucleoli, centrosomes, Cajal bodies, nuclear pores, mitotic spindles, and various ribonucleoprotein-enriched granules. Instead of having clearly defined molecular compositions and architectures known for cellular machineries, such as ribosomes and proteasomes, these membrane-lacking compartments usually have irregular morphologies and are enriched with specific sets of components with poorly defined stoichiometry (Brangwynne et al., 2009Brangwynne C.P.

Compartmentalization is even more critical for neurons because of their large sizes and extreme polarity. In addition to membrane-enclosed organelles and membrane-lacking compartments common to other cell types, neurons contain a unique type of membrane-semi-enclosed compartments, known as synapses, which are molecular apparatuses dictating signal processing and transmissions in all nervous systems. Underneath the postsynaptic plasma membranes of each synapse resides a protein-rich sub-compartment known as postsynaptic density (PSD), an assembly responsible for receiving, interpreting, and storage of signals transmitted by presynaptic axonal termini. PSDs are disc-shaped, electron-dense thickenings that contact with postsynaptic membranes on its one face and with cytoplasm on the other face, forming semi-open mesoscale cellular compartments. Biochemical and electron microscopy (EM) analyses revealed that PSDs are composed of densely packed proteins forming mega-assemblies with a few hundred nanometer in width and ∼30–50 nm in thickness (Chen et al., 2008Chen X. Winters C. Azzam R. Li X. Galbraith J.A. Leapman R.D. Reese T.S. Organization of the core structure of the postsynaptic density.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Since its discovery, considerable progress has been made in identifying both the compositions and copy numbers of proteins in each PSD (Cheng et al., 2006Cheng D. Hoogenraad C.C. Rush J. Ramm E.

Despite the pivotal roles of PSDs in orchestrating synaptic structure and functions, some of the most fundamental questions remain unanswered. For example, how can the submicron, semi-open PSD compartments autonomously form beneath the synaptic plasma membranes? How are the large concentration gradients of numerous proteins between PSD and spine cytoplasm maintained? How can neuronal activity alter PSD assembly? SynGAP and PSD-95 are two very abundant proteins existing at a near stoichiometric ratio in PSD (Cheng et al., 2006Cheng D. Hoogenraad C.C. Rush J. Ramm E. Schlager M.A. Duong D.M. Xu P. Wijayawardana S.R. Hanfelt J. Nakagawa T. et al.Relative and absolute quantification of postsynaptic density proteome isolated from rat forebrain and cerebellum.Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2006; 5: 1158-1170Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). Mutations of either of SynGAP or PSD-95 are known to cause human psychiatric disorders, such as intellectual disorders (ID) and autism (Berryer et al., 2013Berryer M.H. Hamdan F.F. Klitten L.L.

PSD-95 and its two homologous, PSD-93 and SAP102, are central scaffolding proteins in PSD, orchestrating multiple signaling cascades, as well as shaping the basic architecture of PSD (Chen et al., 2015Chen X.

Zhang M. Mechanistic basis of MAGUK-organized complexes in synaptic development and signalling.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2016; 17: 209-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). SynGAP is a brain-specific GTPase-activating protein (GAP) that predominantly localizes in PSD via specifically binding to PSD-95 (Chen et al., 1998Chen H.-J. Rojas-Soto M. Oguni A. Kennedy M.B.

SynGAP functions as a negative regulator for excitatory synaptic strength through tuning down activities of small G proteins (Araki et al., 2015Araki Y. Zeng M. Zhang M. Huganir R.L.

Chen H.-J. Sokolova I. Knuesel I. Kennedy M.B. SynGAP regulates spine formation.J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 8862-8872Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Downregulation of SynGAP leads to premature hippocampal spine formation and overactivation of excitatory synapses in young mice (Clement et al., 2012Clement J.P. Aceti M. Creson T.K. Ozkan E.D. Shi Y. Reish N.J. Almonte A.G. Miller B.H. Wiltgen B.J.

Chen H.-J. Sokolova I. Knuesel I. Kennedy M.B. SynGAP regulates spine formation.J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 8862-8872Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), which may represent the underlying molecular mechanism of SynGAP mutations found in epileptic, ID, and autism patients. SynGAP has recently been shown to rapidly disperse from PSD following chemical LTP induction, and the activity-dependent dispersion of SynGAP may represent an initial step for LTP expression (Araki et al., 2015Araki Y. Zeng M. Zhang M. Huganir R.L. Rapid dispersion of SynGAP from synaptic spines triggers AMPA receptor insertion and spine enlargement during LTP.Neuron. 2015; 85: 173-189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). In this work, we elucidate the structural basis governing the specific interaction between SynGAP and PSD-95. We discover that SynGAP forms a parallel coiled-coil trimer capable of binding to multiple copies of PSD-95. Importantly, this multivalent SynGAP/PSD-95 interaction leads to the formation of liquid-liquid phase separation, both in vitro and in living cells. The SynGAP/PSD-95 complex in the condensed liquid phase is densely concentrated and dynamically exchanges with the two proteins in the aqueous phase of the cytoplasm, a phenomena reminiscent of activity-dependent SynGAP dispersion from PSD in living neurons. We further show that the multivalent SynGAP/PSD-95 interaction is crucial for SynGAP stabilization in PSD and for preventing neurons from hyper-excitation. Our study indicates that the multivalent postsynaptic protein-protein interaction-induced phase transitions might be a possible mechanism for PSD formation. Our work also provides mechanistic insights into why mutations altering the SynGAP/PSD-95 interaction can contribute to various brain disorders, including autism and ID. We first characterized the SynGAP/PSD-95 interaction using purified proteins. PSD-95 contains three PDZ (PSD-95, Dlg, ZO-1) domains, an SH3 (Src homology 3) domain, and a GK (guanylate kinase) domain (Figure 1A). The α1 isoform of SynGAP (referred to as “SynGAP” hereafter) (Figure 2A) contains a C-terminal PDZ binding motif (PBM), which has been reported to interact with all three PDZ domains of PSD-95 (Kim et al., 1998Kim J.H.

Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC)-based titration assay showed that N-terminal thioredoxin-tagged last 30 residues of SynGAP (SynGAP PBM) binds to each of the three PDZ domains with comparable and weak affinities (Kd of a few dozens of micromolars; Figure 1G, G1). Such weak bindings are unlikely to support a specific functional interaction between SynGAP and PSD-95 in vivo (Ye and Zhang, 2013Ye F. Zhang M.

PSD-95 PDZ3 is known to contain a short αC helix in its C terminus (amino acids [aa] E392–E398, highlighted in pink in Figure 1B), which can enhance PDZ’s target peptide binding through stabilizing the conformation of PDZ3 without directly contacting peptide ligands (Petit et al., 2009Petit C.M. Zhang J. Sapienza P.J. Fuentes E.J. Lee A.L. Hidden dynamic allostery in a PDZ domain.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2009; 106: 18249-18254Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). The boundary of PDZ3 (aa R306–E398) used in our binding assay has already contained this reported αC helix, but our ITC results showed that the affinity between PDZ3 and SynGAP is still very low (Kd ∼27.0 μM, Figure 1C, left). Amino acid sequence analysis reveals that a stretch of residues following αC (aa A399–N410, highlighted in yellow in Figures 1A and 1B) is highly conserved and predicted to form α-helix. We found that a longer version of PDZ3 containing the predicted long C-terminal helix extension (aa R306-S412, referred to as “PDZ3-C” hereafter) binds to SynGAP with a 15-fold higher affinity than does PDZ3 (Figure 1C), and several dozen-fold higher than does PDZ1 or PDZ2 (Figure 1G, G1). Thus, a C-terminal extension sequence beyond the canonical PDZ boundary enhances PSD-95 PDZ3’s binding specificity to SynGAP. To elucidate the molecular mechanism underlying the specific PSD-95 PDZ3-C/SynGAP PBM interaction, we solved the complex structure by X-ray crystallography (Table S1). Crystallization of the complex was facilitated by fusing the last 15 residues of SynGAP to the C terminus of PSD-95 PDZ3-C with a flexible linker. We used NMR spectroscopy to exclude the possibility that the fusion protein used in the crystallization experiment might artificially induce the observed interaction (Figure S1C). Fully consistent with our biochemical data, PSD-95 PDZ3-C in the complex contains an extended αC helix composed of 19 residues (E392-N410), which is 12 residues longer than the extension helix observed in the previously determined PDZ3 structure (Figure S1A) (Doyle et al., 1996Doyle D.A. Lee A. Lewis J. Kim E. Sheng M. MacKinnon R. Crystal structures of a complexed and peptide-free membrane protein-binding domain: molecular basis of peptide recognition by PDZ.Cell. 1996; 85: 1067-1076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (971) Google Scholar). Importantly, this extended αC helix, together with the PDZ3 core, forms the second binding site for SynGAP PBM (Figures 1D and 1E), explaining why the αC extension can enhance PDZ3-C’s binding to SynGAP PBM. In the complex, the last three residues of SynGAP (-2TRV0, the canonical PBM) bind to the αB/βB-groove of PSD-95 PDZ3 following the classical PDZ binding mode. The upstream residues (−9F-V−5) of SynGAP PBM interact with a hydrophobic pocket formed by the extended αC helix, βB and βC strands of PDZ3-C (Figures 1E, 1F, and S1B). The αC helix is highly amphipathic, with all of its hydrophobic residues facing βB and βC forming an elongated hydrophobic pocket accommodating the sidechains of V(−5), W(−6) and F(−9) in SynGAP PBM (Figure 1F). Substitution of V(−5) or F(−9) with a charged Glu, or replacing W(−6) with a smaller hydrophobic Ala all significantly decreased the binding of SynGAP PBM to PSD-95 PDZ3-C (Figure 1G2). SynGAP contains a PH (Pleckstrin homology) domain, a C2 domain, and a GAP (GTPase-activating protein) domain in its N-terminal half (Figure 2A) (Chen et al., 1998Chen H.-J. Rojas-Soto M. Oguni A.

Detailed sequence analysis indicates presence of a possible coiled-coil domain in the C-terminal half of SynGAP. We characterized the C-terminal half of SynGAP containing the predicted coiled-coil domain and the following PBM, and identified a stable fragment (aa A1147-V1308, denoted as “CC-PBM”). Circular dichroism (CD) spectrum of SynGAP CC-PBM indicates that the protein is well-folded and enriched in α-helix (Figure S2A). Fast protein liquid chromatography (FPLC) coupled with a static light-scattering assay revealed that SynGAP CC-PBM (at the 20–150 μM range assayed) has a uniform molecular mass of ∼55.5 kDa in solution, which equals three times of the theoretical monomer mass (Figures 2B and 3D ), indicating that SynGAP forms a stable trimer in solution.Figure 3SynGAP CC-PBM Binds to PSD-95 PSG in a 3:2 StoichiometryShow full caption(A) ITC measurement of the interaction between SynGAP CC-PBM and PSD-95 PSG.(B) Summary of ITC-derived binding affinities between various SynGAP CC-PBM and PSD-95 PSG.(C) Pull-down assay comparing PSD-95 PSG binding to various forms of the full-length SynGAP.(D) FPLC-coupled static light-scattering analysis showing that mixing equal molar of SynGAP CC-PBM and PSD-95 PSG leads to a formation of a 3:2 CC-PBM/PSG complex (black curve).

While metabolite profiling by mass spectrometry is widely applied at the whole-cell level, it is not routinely possible to measure the concentrations of small molecules in mammalian organelles. We describe a method for the rapid and specific isolation of mitochondria and use it in tandem with a database of predicted mitochondrial metabolites (""MITObolome"") to measure the matrix concentrations of more than 100 metabolites across various states of respiratory chain (RC) function. Disruption of the RC reveals extensive compartmentalization of mitochondrial metabolism and signatures unique to the inhibition of each RC complex. Pyruvate enables the proliferation of RC-deficient cells but has surprisingly limited effects on matrix contents. Interestingly, despite failing to restore matrix NADH/NAD balance, pyruvate does increase aspartate, likely through the exchange of matrix glutamate for cytosolic aspartate. We demonstrate the value of mitochondrial metabolite profiling and describe a strategy applicable to other organelles."
https://openalex.org/W2517229912,"Zika virus (ZIKV) can be transmitted sexually between humans. However, it is unknown whether ZIKV replicates in the vagina and impacts the unborn fetus. Here, we establish a mouse model of vaginal ZIKV infection and demonstrate that, unlike other routes, ZIKV replicates within the genital mucosa even in wild-type (WT) mice. Mice lacking RNA sensors or transcription factors IRF3 and IRF7 resulted in higher levels of local viral replication. Furthermore, mice lacking the type I interferon (IFN) receptor (IFNAR) became viremic and died of infection after a high-dose vaginal ZIKV challenge. Notably, vaginal infection of pregnant dams during early pregnancy led to fetal growth restriction and infection of the fetal brain in WT mice. This was exacerbated in mice deficient in IFN pathways, leading to abortion. Our study highlights the vaginal tract as a highly susceptible site of ZIKV replication and illustrates the dire disease consequences during pregnancy."
https://openalex.org/W2512007269,"Cellular compartments that cannot be biochemically isolated are challenging to characterize. Here we demonstrate the proteomic characterization of the synaptic clefts that exist at both excitatory and inhibitory synapses. Normal brain function relies on the careful balance of these opposing neural connections, and understanding how this balance is achieved relies on knowledge of their protein compositions. Using a spatially restricted enzymatic tagging strategy, we mapped the proteomes of two of the most common excitatory and inhibitory synaptic clefts in living neurons. These proteomes reveal dozens of synaptic candidates and assign numerous known synaptic proteins to a specific cleft type. The molecular differentiation of each cleft allowed us to identify Mdga2 as a potential specificity factor influencing Neuroligin-2′s recruitment of presynaptic neurotransmitters at inhibitory synapses."

To interrogate the functional role of alternative splicing in neural development, we analyzed purified neural progenitor cells (NPCs) and neurons from developing cerebral cortices, revealing hundreds of differentially spliced exons that preferentially alter key protein domains—especially in cytoskeletal proteins—and can harbor disease-causing mutations. We show that Ptbp1 and Rbfox proteins antagonistically govern the NPC-to-neuron transition by regulating neuron-specific exons. Whereas Ptbp1 maintains apical progenitors partly through suppressing a poison exon of Flna in NPCs, Rbfox proteins promote neuronal differentiation by switching Ninein from a centrosomal splice form in NPCs to a non-centrosomal isoform in neurons. We further uncover an intronic human mutation within a PTBP1-binding site that disrupts normal skipping of the FLNA poison exon in NPCs and causes a brain-specific malformation.

Radial glial cells (RGCs) maintain long basal processes attached to the pial membrane and undergo mitosis near their apical processes in the ventricular zone (VZ) or outer subventricular zone (oSVZ) to self-renew or produce other types of progenitors, including intermediate progenitors (IPs). IPs undergo limited numbers of divisions to produce neurons. In humans, the massive expansion of the cortex is accompanied by additional numbers of cell divisions, progenitor types, and neuronal circuits by mechanisms that are poorly understood (Lui et al., 2011Lui J.H.

Black D.L. Zheng S. The neurogenetics of alternative splicing.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2016; 17: 265-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar), but the physiological impact of AS on cortical progenitor and neuronal fates remains unclear. On the one hand, systematic studies of cortical neural progenitor cells (NPCs) concentrated mostly on gene-level instead of exon-level expression or detected rather subtle AS changes (Ayoub et al., 2011Ayoub A.E. Oh S. Xie Y. Leng J. Cotney J. Dominguez M.H. Noonan J.P. Rakic P. Transcriptional programs in transient embryonic zones of the cerebral cortex defined by high-resolution mRNA sequencing.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2011; 108: 14950-14955Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). On the other hand, previous AS studies of the developing cerebral cortex centered on either RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) or individual alternative exons, rather than taking a global view of cell-type-specific regulation. Direct comparative investigations of alternative exon usage between cortical NPCs and neurons in a physiological context are not yet available. We performed unbiased RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) comparison of NPCs and neurons isolated directly from developing mouse and human cerebral cortices and identified extensive and conserved AS switches during cortical NPC differentiation. We found that AS preferentially regulates genes encoding cytoskeleton proteins, modulates protein subcellular localization, and involves genes essential for brain development in mice and/or humans. Our results on dynamic switching of Ninein and filamin A isoforms by Rbfox1/2/3 and Ptbp1 proteins reveal developmental roles of AS in regulating centriolar dynamics, NPC self-renewal, and differentiation, uncovering widespread functions of AS in cerebral cortical development. Using a Tbr2-EGFP transgene driving EGFP in dorsal cortex (Figure S1A; Gong et al., 2003Gong S. Zheng C. Doughty M.L. Losos K. Didkovsky N. Schambra U.B. Nowak N.J. Joyner A. Leblanc G. Hatten M.E. Heintz N. A gene expression atlas of the central nervous system based on bacterial artificial chromosomes.Nature. 2003; 425: 917-925Crossref PubMed Scopus (1599) Google Scholar), we found that embryonic day 14.5 (E14.5) VZ NPCs (Sox2+; EGFP−) are well separated from IPs in the subventricular zone (SVZ) (Tbr2+; EGFP+) and differentiating neurons in the intermediate zone (IZ) and cortical plate (CP) (Sox2−; EGFP+; Figures 1A and S1A). We isolated VZ NPCs (EGFP−) and non-VZ cells (EGFP+) from E14.5 Tbr2-EGFP cerebral cortex (Figure 1B) and confirmed their identities: (1) strand-specific RNA-seq and qPCR of sorted cells showed that NPC genes Sox2, Pax6, Nes, and Hes1 were highly enriched in the (EGFP−) cells whereas Tbr1, Fezf2, and Neurod2 were enriched in the (EGFP+) cells (Figures 1C and S1B); (2) the fourth exon of REST, expressed in differentiating neurons (Raj et al., 2011Raj B.

These results indicate that we successfully isolated and analyzed VZ NPCs (EGFP−) and a mixture of differentiating neurons outside the VZ (hereafter referred to as non-VZ or neuron) from developing mouse cerebral cortex.Figure 1Extensive and Conserved Alternative Exon Usages during Cerebral Cortical NPC DifferentiationShow full caption(A) Immunostaining of E14.5 Tbr2-EGFP mouse dorsal cerebral cortex with anti-EGFP (green) and anti-Sox2 (magenta).(B) Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) of green and non-green cells from E14.5 Tbr2-EGFP mouse dorsal cerebral cortex.(C) Heatmap of RNA-seq results showing differential gene expression between sorted VZ and non-VZ cells.(D) Number of alternative exons between neural progenitor cells (NPCs) and differentiating neurons.(E) Histogram showing the size of mouse SEs (x axis) and the percentages of SEs that cause an in-frame insertion or a frameshift (y axis).(F) Conserved SEs in mouse and human cortical neurogenesis.(G) PAGODA analysis distinguishes 224 single fetal cortical cells (Camp et al., 2015Camp J.G.

See also Figure S1. We compared alternative exon usage between E14.5 VZ NPCs and non-VZ cells using the mixture-of-isoforms (MISO) statistical model, which assigned a “percentage spliced in” (PSI) value to each exon by estimating its abundance compared to adjacent exons (Katz et al., 2010Katz Y.

We found that 622 exons were differentially spliced between mouse NPCs and neurons (|ΔPSI| ≥ 10% and Bayes factor ≥ 5; the same criteria used hereafter if not specified), with 345 showing higher inclusion in neurons and 277 higher in NPCs. We analyzed VZ and CP samples from two additional RNA-seq datasets (Ayoub et al., 2011Ayoub A.E. Oh S. Xie Y. Leng J. Cotney J. Dominguez M.H. Noonan J.P. Rakic P.

USA. 2012; 109: 11836-11841Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar) and found 742 AS changes shared by at least two of the three datasets (Figures 1D and S1G). Two hundred seventy-two cassette exons or skipped exons (SE) comprised the largest portion of AS events, with 198 (73%) SEs showing higher inclusion in neurons than in NPCs (Figure 1D), 255 (94%) SEs shorter than 300 nt (Figure S1H), and 61 (22%) SEs causing frameshifts (Figure 1E). These results indicate that hundreds of alternative exon usages occur when VZ NPCs differentiate in mice. The developing human cortex has an enormously expanded oSVZ housing the largest population of dividing progenitors, the most prominent being outer radial glial (oRG) cells that resemble aRG cells but lack apical processes. We compared laser microdissected oSVZ to VZ, inner SVZ (iSVZ), and CP (Fietz et al., 2012Fietz S.A. Lachmann R. Brandl H. Kircher M. Samusik N. Schröder R. Lakshmanaperumal N. Henry I. Vogt J.

Doan R.N. Hecht J.L. Walsh C.A. Single-cell analysis reveals transcriptional heterogeneity of neural progenitors in human cortex.Nat. Neurosci. 2015; 18: 637-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar), and found that most splicing switches occur between neural progenitors in the VZ and neurons in the CP (2,582 exons; Figures S1I and S1J), with 31% of human cassette exons (|ΔPSI| ≥ 15%; Bayes factor ≥ 10) causing a translational frameshift (Figure S1K). When SE, A3SS, A5SS, mutually exclusive exons (MXE), and retained introns (RI) (Figure 1D) were considered, 38% of mouse differential splicing events were also differentially spliced in human, including 113/272 (42%) mouse SEs (Figure 1F). To compare AS between pure NPC and neuronal populations, we further analyzed RNA-seq data of 224 single cells from three human fetal cortices (Camp et al., 2015Camp J.G. Badsha F. Florio M. Kanton S. Gerber T. Wilsch-Bräuninger M. Lewitus E. Sykes A. Hevers W. Lancaster M. et al.Human cerebral organoids recapitulate gene expression programs of fetal neocortex development.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2015; 112: 15672-15677Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Using the unbiased pathway and gene set overdispersion analysis approach (PAGODA) (Fan et al., 2016Fan J. Salathia N. Liu R. Kaeser G.E. Yung Y.C. Herman J.L. Kaper F. Fan J.B. Zhang K. Chun J. Kharchenko P.V. Characterizing transcriptional heterogeneity through pathway and gene set overdispersion analysis.Nat. Methods. 2016; 13: 241-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar), we were able to identify distinct transcriptional subpopulations corresponding to RGs, IPs, immature neurons, and neurons (Figure 1G). We then pooled single RGs and single neurons in silico and extended our MISO analysis to these putatively pure RG and mature neuron populations, which gave rise to 298 significant cassette exon changes. Consistent with bulk samples, more SEs show higher inclusion in neurons (166) than in RGs (132). For 26 SEs that were also identified in human bulk samples, ΔPSIs are significantly correlated between bulk and pooled single-cell analyses (p value = 1.7e−4; Figures 1H and 1I). These results indicate that extensive alternative exon usages occur when VZ NPCs differentiate in mouse and human cerebral cortex and many of them may critically regulate gene function by shifting translational frames, though we focus here mainly on those shared by mouse and human to allow functional analysis of their mechanism. Gene ontology analysis for differentially spliced exons revealed that cytoskeleton genes are overrepresented in mouse and human (Figures 2A, S2A, and S2B). Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analyses of alternative exons also revealed enriched functions in regulating tight junctions and actin cytoskeleton (Figure S2C; data not shown). Differential mouse SEs between E14.5 NPCs and neurons were validated by RT-PCR, and many of these events were switch-like (|ΔPSI| > 50%; Figures 2B–2F, S2D, and S2E; Table S1). Notably, alternatively spliced cytoskeleton genes encoded functionally interconnected protein networks (Figures 2G–2I) involved in NPC proliferation, neuronal migration, and neuronal differentiation. Over a dozen genes alternatively spliced during the NPC-to-neuron transition—including Add1, Ank2, Flna, Kif2a, Macf1, Scrib, and Syne2—have previously been shown to be required for normal cerebral cortical development in mice (Table S2), and certain alternative exons harbor mutations that associate with human brain disorders, such as microcephaly and autism (Figures 2J–2M and below), suggesting cell-type-specific mechanisms of human diseases.Figure S2Alternative Splicing Preferentially Regulates Genes Encoding Cytoskeleton-Related Proteins during Neurogenesis, Related to Figure 2Show full caption(A) Gene ontology analysis of human genes that were differentially spliced between GW13-16 fetal human NPCs and neurons, showing that genes related to cytoskeleton and other biological functions were overrepresented.(B) A Venn diagram showing that alternative exons in 38 of 66 (58%) cytoskeleton related mouse SEs are also alternatively spliced in the developing human cerebral cortex.(C) KEGG pathway analysis of alternatively spliced genes revealed their functions (red stars) in regulating tight junctions (p-value = 0.002).(D and E) Additional RT-PCR analyses of alternatively spliced exons in microtubule- (C) and actin- (D) related genes in mice.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) (A) Gene ontology analysis of human genes that were differentially spliced between GW13-16 fetal human NPCs and neurons, showing that genes related to cytoskeleton and other biological functions were overrepresented.

Among 61 splicing changes in 49 genes regulating cytoskeleton (Table S3), 20 (33%) of them caused insertion or deletion of one or more entire protein domains (Figures 3A, 3B, and S3A–S3C ). Multiple genes showed AS of membrane-targeting domains (Figure 3B), which typically regulate subcellular localization. Another 13 (21%) alternative exons—including a microexon—inserted extra amino acids (extraAAs) into well-defined protein domains (Figures 3A, S3A, and S3C). Thus, more than half (54%) of differentially spliced regions directly regulate protein domains.Figure S3Alternatively Spliced Exons during Neurogenesis Critically Alter Protein Structures, Related to Figure 3Show full caption(A) Number of amino acids affected by alternative splicing and their impact on protein domains, with bars showing the median size.

We have shown a large Nin alternative exon 18 (>2,000 nt) that is almost exclusively included in mouse and human NPCs but skipped in neurons (Figures 2J and 2K; ΔPSI = −83.5%). In contrast, we also identified a conserved 61-nt exon (exon 29) of Nin that is specifically included in neurons (CP) but skipped in NPCs (Figures 3C and 3D; ΔPSI = 74.0%), introducing a frameshift and truncating the C terminus of Nin (Figures 3E and 3F). Nin associates with the mother centriole to anchor microtubules, with its C-terminal segment targeting efficiently to centrosomes (Delgehyr et al., 2005Delgehyr N. Sillibourne J. Bornens M.

We hypothesized that lung-specific immunoregulatory mechanisms create an immunologically permissive environment for tumor colonization. We found that T-cell-intrinsic expression of the oxygen-sensing prolyl-hydroxylase (PHD) proteins is required to maintain local tolerance against innocuous antigens in the lung but powerfully licenses colonization by circulating tumor cells. PHD proteins limit pulmonary type helper (Th)-1 responses, promote CD4(+)-regulatory T (Treg) cell induction, and restrain CD8(+) T cell effector function. Tumor colonization is accompanied by PHD-protein-dependent induction of pulmonary Treg cells and suppression of IFN-γ-dependent tumor clearance. T-cell-intrinsic deletion or pharmacological inhibition of PHD proteins limits tumor colonization of the lung and improves the efficacy of adoptive cell transfer immunotherapy. Collectively, PHD proteins function in T cells to coordinate distinct immunoregulatory programs within the lung that are permissive to cancer metastasis. PAPERCLIP."
https://openalex.org/W2515307706,"The glucocorticoid receptor (GR) binds the human genome at >10,000 sites but only regulates the expression of hundreds of genes. To determine the functional effect of each site, we measured the glucocorticoid (GC) responsive activity of nearly all GR binding sites (GBSs) captured using chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) in A549 cells. 13% of GBSs assayed had GC-induced activity. The responsive sites were defined by direct GR binding via a GC response element (GRE) and exclusively increased reporter-gene expression. Meanwhile, most GBSs lacked GC-induced reporter activity. The non-responsive sites had epigenetic features of steady-state enhancers and clustered around direct GBSs. Together, our data support a model in which clusters of GBSs observed with ChIP-seq reflect interactions between direct and tethered GBSs over tens of kilobases. We further show that those interactions can synergistically modulate the activity of direct GBSs and may therefore play a major role in driving gene activation in response to GCs."
https://openalex.org/W2508968739,"Hundreds of human cullin-RING E3 ligases (CRLs) modify thousands of proteins with ubiquitin (UB) to achieve vast regulation. Current dogma posits that CRLs first catalyze UB transfer from an E2 to their client substrates and subsequent polyubiquitylation from various linkage-specific E2s. We report an alternative E3-E3 tagging cascade: many cellular NEDD8-modified CRLs associate with a mechanistically distinct thioester-forming RBR-type E3, ARIH1, and rely on ARIH1 to directly add the first UB and, in some cases, multiple additional individual monoubiquitin modifications onto CRL client substrates. Our data define ARIH1 as a component of the human CRL system, demonstrate that ARIH1 can efficiently and specifically mediate monoubiquitylation of several CRL substrates, and establish principles for how two distinctive E3s can reciprocally control each other for simultaneous and joint regulation of substrate ubiquitylation. These studies have broad implications for CRL-dependent proteostasis and mechanisms of E3-mediated UB ligation."
https://openalex.org/W2512628654,"Magnetoencephalography (MEG) is a sophisticated tool which yields rich information on the spatial, spectral and temporal signatures of human brain function. Despite unique potential, MEG is limited by a low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) which is caused by both the inherently small magnetic fields generated by the brain, and the scalp-to-sensor distance. The latter is limited in current systems due to a requirement for pickup coils to be cryogenically cooled. Recent work suggests that optically-pumped magnetometers (OPMs) might be a viable alternative to superconducting detectors for MEG measurement. They have the advantage that sensors can be brought to within ~4 mm of the scalp, thus offering increased sensitivity. Here, using simulations, we quantify the advantages of hypothetical OPM systems in terms of sensitivity, reconstruction accuracy and spatial resolution. Our results show that a multi-channel whole-head OPM system offers (on average) a fivefold improvement in sensitivity for an adult brain, as well as clear improvements in reconstruction accuracy and spatial resolution. However, we also show that such improvements depend critically on accurate forward models; indeed, the reconstruction accuracy of our simulated OPM system only outperformed that of a simulated superconducting system in cases where forward field error was less than 5%. Overall, our results imply that the realisation of a viable whole-head multi-channel OPM system could generate a step change in the utility of MEG as a means to assess brain electrophysiological activity in health and disease. However in practice, this will require both improved hardware and modelling algorithms."
https://openalex.org/W2510045171,"Cancers are distributed unevenly across the body, but the importance of cell intrinsic factors such as stem cell function in determining organ cancer risk is unknown. Therefore, we used Cre-recombination of conditional lineage tracing, oncogene, and tumor suppressor alleles to define populations of stem and non-stem cells in mouse organs and test their life-long susceptibility to tumorigenesis. We show that tumor incidence is determined by the life-long generative capacity of mutated cells. This relationship held true in the presence of multiple genotypes and regardless of developmental stage, strongly supporting the notion that stem cells dictate organ cancer risk. Using the liver as a model system, we further show that damage-induced activation of stem cell function markedly increases cancer risk. Therefore, we propose that a combination of stem cell mutagenesis and extrinsic factors that enhance the proliferation of these cell populations, creates a ""perfect storm"" that ultimately determines organ cancer risk.

https://openalex.org/W2514377229,"While an essential role of HIV-1 integrase (IN) for integration of viral cDNA into human chromosome is established, studies with IN mutants and allosteric IN inhibitors (ALLINIs) have suggested that IN can also influence viral particle maturation. However, it has remained enigmatic as to how IN contributes to virion morphogenesis. Here, we demonstrate that IN directly binds the viral RNA genome in virions. These interactions have specificity, as IN exhibits distinct preference for select viral RNA structural elements. We show that IN substitutions that selectively impair its binding to viral RNA result in eccentric, non-infectious virions without affecting nucleocapsid-RNA interactions. Likewise, ALLINIs impair IN binding to viral RNA in virions of wild-type, but not escape mutant, virus. These results reveal an unexpected biological role of IN binding to the viral RNA genome during virion morphogenesis and elucidate the mode of action of ALLINIs."

The motor cortices are involved in planning and executing movements, but it is unclear whether they encode reward over and above limb kinematics and dynamics. Here, we report a categorical reward signal in dorsal premotor (PMd) and primary motor (M1) neurons that corresponds to an increase in firing rates when a trial was not rewarded regardless of whether or not a reward was expected. We show that this signal is unrelated to error magnitude, reward prediction error, or other task confounds such as reward consumption, return reach plan, or kinematic differences across rewarded and unrewarded trials. The availability of reward information in motor cortex is crucial for theories of reward-based learning and motivational influences on actions."
https://openalex.org/W2507865182,"Allergic asthma and obesity are the leading health problems in the world. Many studies have shown that obesity is a risk factor of development of asthma. However, the underlying mechanism has not been well established. In this study, we demonstrate that leptin, an adipokine elevated in obese individuals, promoted proliferation and survival of pro-allergic type 2 helper T cells and group 2 innate lymphoid cells and production of type 2 cytokines, which together contribute to allergic responses. Leptin activates mTORC1, MAPK, and STAT3 pathways in TH2 cells. The effects of leptin on TH2 cell proliferation, survival, and cytokine production are dependent on the mTORC1 and MAPK pathways as revealed by specific inhibitors. In vivo, leptin-deficiency led to attenuated experimental allergic airway inflammation. Our results thus support that obesity-associated elevation of leptin contributes to the increased susceptibility of asthma via modulation of pro-allergic lymphocyte responses."
https://openalex.org/W2511562679,"The purpose of current study aims to investigate the development and progression of diabetic retinopathy (DR) in patients with diabetic nephropathy (DN) in a nationwide population-based cohort in Taiwan. Newly diagnosed DN patients and age- and sex-matched controls were identified from the Taiwanese Longitudinal Health Insurance Database from 2000 to 2010. We studied the effects of age, sex, hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetic polyneuropathy (DPN), and medications on the development of nonproliferative DR (NPDR), proliferative DR (PDR), and diabetic macular edema (DME) in patients with DN. Cox proportional hazard regression analyses were used to estimate the adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) of the development of DR. Our results show that the adjusted HRs of NPDR and PDR were 5.01 (95% confidence interval (CI) = 4.68-5.37) and 9.7 (95% CI = 8.15-11.5), respectively, in patients with DN as compared with patients in the non-DN cohort. At 5-year follow-up, patients with DN showed an increased HR of NPDR progression to PDR (HR = 2.26, 95% CI = 1.68-3.03), and the major comorbidities were hypertension (HR = 1.23, 95% CI = 1.10-1.38 with NPDR; HR = 1.33, 95% CI = 1.02-1.72 with PDR) and DPN (HR = 2.03, 95% CI = 1.72-2.41 in NPDR; HR = 2.95, 95% CI = 2.16-4.03 in PDR). Dyslipidemia increased the HR of developing NPDR but not PDR or DME. Moreover, DN did not significantly affect DME development (HR = 1.47, 95% CI = 0.87-2.48) or progression (HR = 0.37, 95% CI = 0.11-1.20). We concluded that DN was an independent risk factor for DR development and progression; however, DN did not markedly affect DME development in this study, and the potential association between these disorders requires further investigation."
https://openalex.org/W2518093640,"Purpose We developed a new portable head-mounted perimeter, “imo”, which performs visual field (VF) testing under flexible conditions without a dark room. Besides the monocular eye test, imo can present a test target randomly to either eye without occlusion (a binocular random single eye test). The performance of imo was evaluated. Methods Using full HD transmissive LCD and high intensity LED backlights, imo can display a test target under the same test conditions as the Humphrey Field Analyzer (HFA). The monocular and binocular random single eye tests by imo and the HFA test were performed on 40 eyes of 20 subjects with glaucoma. VF sensitivity results by the monocular and binocular random single eye tests were compared, and these test results were further compared to those by the HFA. The subjects were asked whether they noticed which eye was being tested during the test. Results The mean sensitivity (MS) obtained with the HFA highly correlated with the MS by the imo monocular test (R: r = 0.96, L: r = 0.94, P < 0.001) and the binocular random single eye test (R: r = 0.97, L: r = 0.98, P < 0.001). The MS values by the monocular and binocular random single eye tests also highly correlated (R: r = 0.96, L: r = 0.95, P < 0.001). No subject could detect which eye was being tested during the examination. Conclusions The perimeter imo can obtain VF sensitivity highly compatible to that by the standard automated perimeter. The binocular random single eye test provides a non-occlusion test condition without the examinee being aware of the tested eye."
https://openalex.org/W2511043561,"There is increasing evidence that energy metabolism is disturbed in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) patients and animal models. Treatment with triheptanoin, the triglyceride of heptanoate, is a promising approach to provide alternative fuel to improve oxidative phosphorylation and aid ATP generation. Heptanoate can be metabolized to propionyl-CoA, which after carboxylation can produce succinyl-CoA and thereby re-fill the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle (anaplerosis). Here we tested the hypothesis that treatment with triheptanoin prevents motor neuron loss and delays the onset of disease symptoms in female mice overexpressing the mutant human SOD1G93A (hSOD1G93A) gene. When oral triheptanoin (35% of caloric content) was initiated at P35, motor neuron loss at 70 days of age was attenuated by 33%. In untreated hSOD1G93A mice, the loss of hind limb grip strength began at 16.7 weeks. Triheptanoin maintained hind limb grip strength for 2.8 weeks longer (p<0.01). Loss of balance on the rotarod and reduction of body weight were delayed by 13 and 11 days respectively (both p<0.01). Improved motor function occurred in parallel with alterations in the expression of genes associated with muscle metabolism. In gastrocnemius muscles, the mRNA levels of pyruvate, 2-oxoglutarate and succinate dehydrogenases and methyl-malonyl mutase were reduced by 24-33% in 10 week old hSOD1G93A mice when compared to wild-type mice, suggesting that TCA cycling in skeletal muscle may be slowed in this ALS mouse model at a stage when muscle strength is still normal. At 25 weeks of age, mRNA levels of succinate dehydrogenases, glutamic pyruvic transaminase 2 and the propionyl carboxylase β subunit were reduced by 69-84% in control, but not in triheptanoin treated hSOD1G93A animals. Taken together, our results suggest that triheptanoin slows motor neuron loss and the onset of motor symptoms in ALS mice by improving TCA cycling."

This study aims to understand the determinants of public, private and multiple insurance coverage among people of retirement-age in China.We used data from the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Survey 2011 and 2013, a nationally representative survey of Chinese people aged 45 and over. Multinomial logit regression was performed to identify the determinants of public, private and multiple health insurance coverage. We also conducted logit regression to examine the association between public insurance coverage and demand for private insurance.In 2013, 94.5% of this population had at least one type of public insurance, and 12.2% purchased private insurance. In general, we found that rural residents were less likely to be uninsured (Relative Risk Ratio (RRR) = 0.40, 95% Confidence Interval (CI): 0.34-0.47) and were less likely to buy private insurance (RRR = 0.22, 95% CI: 0.16-0.31). But rural-to-urban migrants were more likely to be uninsured (RRR = 1.39, 95% CI: 1.24-1.57). Public health insurance coverage may crowd out private insurance market (Odds Ratio = 0.55, 95% CI: 0.48-0.63), particularly among enrollees of Urban Resident Basic Medical Insurance. There exists a huge socioeconomic disparity in both public and private insurance coverage.The migrants, the poor and the vulnerable remained in the edge of the system. The growing private insurance market did not provide sufficient financial protection and did not cover the people with the greatest need. To achieve universal coverage and reduce socioeconomic disparity, China should integrate the urban and rural public insurance schemes across regions and remove the barriers for the middle-income and low-income to access private insurance."

In Australia there is a fully-funded, school-based National HPV Vaccination Program which has achieved vaccine initiation rate of 82% among age-eligible females. Improving HPV vaccination rates is important in the prevention of morbidity and mortality associated with HPV-related disease. This study aimed to identify factors and barriers associated with uptake of the HPV vaccine in the Australian Program.Between 2011 and 2014, females aged 18-25 years, living in Victoria, Australia who were offered HPV vaccination between 2007 and 2009 as part of the National HPV Vaccination Program, living in Victoria, Australia were recruited into a a young women's study examining effectiveness of the Australian National HPV Vaccination Program. Overall, 668 participants completed the recruitment survey, which collected data of participants' demographics and HPV knowledge. In 2015 these participants were invited to complete an additional supplementary survey on parental demographics and attitudes towards vaccinations.In 2015, 417 participants completed the supplementary survey (62% response rate). Overall, 19% of participants were unvaccinated. In multivariate analyses, HPV vaccination was significantly associated with their being born in Australia (p<0.001), having completed childhood vaccinations (p<0.001) and their parents being main decision-makers for participants' HPV vaccination (p<0.001). The main reason reported for HPV non-vaccination was parental concern about vaccine safety (43%). Compared with HPV-vaccinated participants, those unvaccinated were significantly more likely to be opposed to all vaccines, including HPV vaccines (p<0.001) and were less likely to consider vaccinating their own children with all vaccines (p = 0.033), including HPV vaccines (p<0.001). Overall, 61% of unvaccinated participants reported that a recommendation from GPs would increase HPV vaccine acceptance.Attitudes towards general health, vaccinations in general, as well as HPV vaccines are important in HPV vaccine uptake. Long-term monitoring of the knowledge, attitude and beliefs towards HPV vaccination in the community is critical to ensure a continued high uptake of the vaccine and success of the program."
https://openalex.org/W2510498006,"Many species of birds breeding on ocean beaches and in coastal dunes are of global conservation concern. Most of these species rely on invertebrates (e.g. insects, small crustaceans) as an irreplaceable food source, foraging primarily around the strandline on the upper beach near the dunes. Sandy beaches are also prime sites for human recreation, which impacts these food resources via negative trampling effects. We quantified acute trampling impacts on assemblages of upper shore invertebrates in a controlled experiment over a range of foot traffic intensities (up to 56 steps per square metre) on a temperate beach in Victoria, Australia. Trampling significantly altered assemblage structure (species composition and density) and was correlated with significant declines in invertebrate abundance and species richness. Trampling effects were strongest for rare species. In heavily trafficked plots the abundance of sand hoppers (Amphipoda), a principal prey item of threatened Hooded Plovers breeding on this beach, was halved. In contrast to the consistently strong effects of trampling, natural habitat attributes (e.g. sediment grain size, compactness) were much less influential predictors. If acute suppression of invertebrates caused by trampling, as demonstrated here, is more widespread on beaches it may constitute a significant threat to endangered vertebrates reliant on these invertebrates. This calls for a re-thinking of conservation actions by considering active management of food resources, possibly through enhancement of wrack or direct augmentation of prey items to breeding territories."
https://openalex.org/W2514495836,"BACKGROUND: There is a perception that genomic differences in the species/lineages of the nine species making the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC) may affect the efficacy of distinct control tools in certain geographical areas. We therefore analyzed the prevalence and spatial distribution of MTBC species and lineages among isolates from pulmonary TB cases over an 8-year period, 2007-2014.
METHODOLOGY: Mycobacterial species isolated by culture from consecutively recruited pulmonary tuberculosis patients presenting at selected district/sub-district health facilities were confirmed as MTBC by IS6110 and rpos PCR and further assigned lineages and sub lineages by spoligotyping and large sequence polymorphism PCR (RDs 4, 9, 12, 702, 711) assays. Patient characteristics, residency, and risks were obtained with a structured questionnaire. We used SaTScan and ArcMap analyses to identify significantly clustered MTBC lineages within selected districts and spatial display, respectively.
RESULTS: Among 2,551 isolates, 2,019 (79.1%), 516 (20.2%) and 16 (0.6%) were identified as M. tuberculosis sensu stricto (MTBss), M. africanum (Maf), 15 M. bovis and 1 M. caprae, respectively. The proportions of MTBss and Maf were fairly constant within the study period. Maf spoligotypes were dominated by Spoligotype International Type (SIT) 331 (25.42%), SIT 326 (15.25%) and SIT 181 (14.12%). We found M. bovis to be significantly higher in Northern Ghana (1.9% of 212) than Southern Ghana (0.5% of 2339) (p = 0.020). Using the purely spatial and space-time analysis, seven significant MTBC lineage clusters (p< 0.05) were identified. Notable among the clusters were Ghana and Cameroon sub-lineages found to be associated with north and south, respectively.
CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated that overall, 79.1% of TB in Ghana is caused by MTBss and 20% by M. africanum. Unlike some West African Countries, we did not observe a decline of Maf prevalence in Ghana."
https://openalex.org/W2509890384,"Retinal microaneurysms (MAs) are the earliest clinically observable lesions of diabetic retinopathy. Reliable automated MAs detection is thus critical for early diagnosis of diabetic retinopathy. This paper proposes a novel method for the automated MAs detection in color fundus images based on gradient vector analysis and class imbalance classification, which is composed of two stages, i.e. candidate MAs extraction and classification. In the first stage, a candidate MAs extraction algorithm is devised by analyzing the gradient field of the image, in which a multi-scale log condition number map is computed based on the gradient vectors for vessel removal, and then the candidate MAs are localized according to the second order directional derivatives computed in different directions. Due to the complexity of fundus image, besides a small number of true MAs, there are also a large amount of non-MAs in the extracted candidates. Classifying the true MAs and the non-MAs is an extremely class imbalanced classification problem. Therefore, in the second stage, several types of features including geometry, contrast, intensity, edge, texture, region descriptors and other features are extracted from the candidate MAs and a class imbalance classifier, i.e., RUSBoost, is trained for the MAs classification. With the Retinopathy Online Challenge (ROC) criterion, the proposed method achieves an average sensitivity of 0.433 at 1/8, 1/4, 1/2, 1, 2, 4 and 8 false positives per image on the ROC database, which is comparable with the state-of-the-art approaches, and 0.321 on the DiaRetDB1 V2.1 database, which outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches."
https://openalex.org/W2514295197,"N-Glycosylation of integrin α5β1 plays important roles in cell biologic functions; however, the mechanisms that underlie those roles remain poorly understood. Here, we present evidence that the membrane-proximal N-glycosylation on integrin β1 could positively regulate cell migration by promoting β1 activation. The S4-6 β1 mutant contains only 3 N-glycosylation sites, which are essential for α5 and β1 heterodimer formation, and despite only a small difference in expression levels of α5β1 between wild-type and S4-6 mutant, cell spreading and migration of the S4-6 mutant was significantly decreased compared with that of control. Consistent with these phenotypes, β1-mediated cellular signaling and its activation were clearly suppressed in the S4-6 mutant. Of note, these developments could be rescued by restoration of N-glycosylation sites in the membrane-proximal domain. Further study on the regulatory mechanisms suggested that membrane-proximal N-glycosylation is critical for intermolecular interactions between integrin β1 and other cell membrane proteins, such as syndecan-4 and epidermal growth factor receptor. Moreover, α2,6-sialylation is required for β1 activation. These data suggest a novel regulatory mechanism wherein N-glycosylation near the cell membrane on β1 may serve as a platform that facilitates its complex formation on the cell membrane, thereby affecting integrin-mediated functions.-Hou, S., Hang, Q., Isaji, T., Lu, J., Fukuda, T., Gu, J.

https://openalex.org/W2515306238,"Background Low activity levels in inpatient rehabilitation are associated with adverse outcomes. The study aimed to test whether activity levels can be increased by the provision of monitored activity data to patients and clinicians in the context of explicit goal setting. Methods A randomized controlled trial in three sites in Australia included 255 inpatients aged 60 and older who had a rehabilitation goal to become ambulant. The primary outcome was patients’ walking time measured by accelerometers during the rehabilitation admission. Walking times from accelerometry were made available daily to treating therapists and intervention participants to motivate patients to improve incidental activity levels and reach set goals. For the control group, ‘usual care’ was followed, including the setting of mobility goals; however, for this group, neither staff nor patients received data on walking times to aid the setting of daily walking time targets. Results The median daily walking time in the intervention group increased from 10.3 minutes at baseline to 32.1 minutes at day 28, compared with an increase from 9.5 to 26.5 minutes per day in the control group. Subjects in the intervention group had significantly higher non-therapy walking time by about 7 minutes [mean (95% CI): 24.6 (21.7, 27.4)] compared to those in the control group [mean(95% CI): 17.3 (14.4, 20.3)] (p = 0.001). Conclusions Daily feedback to patients and therapists using an accelerometer increased walking times during rehabilitation admissions. The results of this study suggest objective monitoring of activity levels could provide clinicians with information on clinically important, mobility-related activities to assist goal setting.

As the siRNA signal with a specific RNA determinant moves through plasmodesmata and sieve elements, we attempted to induce TGS of a transgene and an endogenous gene of potato (Solanum tuberosum) rootstock by grafting using siRNA produced in a tobacco (Nicotiana benthamiana) scion. Our results provide evidence that this system can induce TGS of target genes in tubers formed on potato rootstock. The TGS is maintained in the progeny tubers lacking the transported siRNAs. Our findings reveal that epigenome editing using mobile RNA has the potential to allow breeding of artificial sport cultivars in vegetative propagation crops."
https://openalex.org/W2513815885,"Catechol O-methyltransferase (COMT) is a SAM- and Mg2+-dependent methyltransferase that regulates neurotransmitters through methylation. Simulations and experiments have identified divergent catecholamine substrate orientations in the COMT active site: molecular dynamics simulations have favored a monodentate coordination of catecholate substrates to the active site Mg2+, and crystal structures instead preserve bidentate coordination along with short (2.65 Å) methyl donor-acceptor distances. We carry out longer dynamics (up to 350 ns) to quantify interconversion between bidentate and monodentate binding poses. We provide a systematic determination of the relative free energy of the monodentate and bidentate structures in order to identify whether structural differences alter the nature of the methyl transfer mechanism and source of enzymatic rate enhancement. We demonstrate that the bidentate and monodentate binding modes are close in energy but separated by a 7 kcal/mol free energy barrier. Analysis of interactions in the two binding modes reveals that the driving force for monodentate catecholate orientations in classical molecular dynamics simulations is derived from stronger electrostatic stabilization afforded by alternate Mg2+ coordination with strongly charged active site carboxylates. Mixed semi-empirical-classical (SQM/MM) substrate C-O distances (2.7 Å) for the bidentate case are in excellent agreement with COMT X-ray crystal structures, as long as charge transfer between the substrates, Mg2+, and surrounding ligands is permitted. SQM/MM free energy barriers for methyl transfer from bidentate and monodentate catecholate configurations are comparable at around 21–22 kcal/mol, in good agreement with experiment (18–19 kcal/mol). Overall, the work suggests that both binding poses are viable for methyl transfer, and accurate descriptions of charge transfer and electrostatics are needed to provide balanced relative barriers when multiple binding poses are accessible, for example in other transferases."
https://openalex.org/W2510208988,"Statutory recording of carcass lesions at the abattoir may have significant potential as a resource for surveillance of livestock populations. Food Standards Agency (FSA) data in Great Britain are not currently used for surveillance purposes. There are concerns that the sensitivity of detection, combined with other issues, may make the outputs unreliable. In this study we postulate that FSA data could be used for surveillance purposes. To test this we compared FSA data with BPHS (a targeted surveillance system of slaughtered pigs) and laboratory diagnostic scanning surveillance (FarmFile) data, from mid-2008 to mid-2012, for respiratory conditions and tail bite lesions in pigs at population level. We also evaluated the agreement/correlation at batch level between FSA and BPHS inspections in four field trials during 2013. Temporal trends and regional differences at population level were described and compared using logistic regression models. Population temporal analysis showed an increase in respiratory disease in all datasets but with regional differences. For tail bite, the temporal trend and monthly patterns were completely different between the datasets. The field trials were run in three abattoirs and included 322 batches. Pearson’s correlation and Cohen’s kappa tests were used to assess correlation/agreement between inspections systems. It was moderate to strong for high prevalence conditions but slight for low prevalence conditions. We conclude that there is potential to use FSA data as a component of a surveillance system to monitor temporal trends and regional differences of chosen indicators at population level. At producer level and for low prevalence conditions it needs further improvement. Overall a number of issues still need to be addressed in order to provide the pig industry with the confidence to base their decisions on these FSA inspection data. Similar conclusions, at national level, may apply to other livestock sectors but require further evaluation of the inspection and data collection processes."
https://openalex.org/W2510487214,"Supervised machine learning methods typically require splitting data into multiple chunks for training, validating, and finally testing classifiers. For finding the best parameters of a classifier, training and validation are usually carried out with cross-validation. This is followed by application of the classifier with optimized parameters to a separate test set for estimating the classifier’s generalization performance. With limited data, this separation of test data creates a difficult trade-off between having more statistical power in estimating generalization performance versus choosing better parameters and fitting a better model. We propose a novel approach that we term “Cross-validation and cross-testing” improving this trade-off by re-using test data without biasing classifier performance. The novel approach is validated using simulated data and electrophysiological recordings in humans and rodents. The results demonstrate that the approach has a higher probability of discovering significant results than the standard approach of cross-validation and testing, while maintaining the nominal alpha level. In contrast to nested cross-validation, which is maximally efficient in re-using data, the proposed approach additionally maintains the interpretability of individual parameters. Taken together, we suggest an addition to currently used machine learning approaches which may be particularly useful in cases where model weights do not require interpretation, but parameters do."

https://openalex.org/W2507956838,"Complex, sustained, dynamic, and naturalistic visual stimulation can evoke distributed brain activities that are highly reproducible within and across individuals. However, the precise origins of such reproducible responses remain incompletely understood. Here, we employed concurrent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and eye tracking to investigate the experimental and behavioral factors that influence fMRI activity and its intra- and inter-subject reproducibility during repeated movie stimuli. We found that widely distributed and highly reproducible fMRI responses were attributed primarily to the high-level natural content in the movie. In the absence of such natural content, low-level visual features alone in a spatiotemporally scrambled control stimulus evoked significantly reduced degree and extent of reproducible responses, which were mostly confined to the primary visual cortex (V1). We also found that the varying gaze behavior affected the cortical response at the peripheral part of V1 and in the oculomotor network, with minor effects on the response reproducibility over the extrastriate visual areas. Lastly, scene transitions in the movie stimulus due to film editing partly caused the reproducible fMRI responses at widespread cortical areas, especially along the ventral visual pathway. Therefore, the naturalistic nature of a movie stimulus is necessary for driving highly reliable visual activations. In a movie-stimulation paradigm, scene transitions and individuals’ gaze behavior should be taken as potential confounding factors in order to properly interpret cortical activity that supports natural vision."
https://openalex.org/W2517161982,"Recent progresses in genomic technologies provide both opportunities and challenges to forensics. Recent progresses in genomic technologies provide both opportunities and challenges to forensics. In 1984, a British geneticist studying inherited diseases stared in confusion at the jumbled results of a test he had just run, a test that included DNA from a father, mother, and daughter. Then, with a flash of insight, he realized that the differences and similarities between the three results meant that a DNA profile could be used to distinguish between individuals and to resolve paternity disputes. A decade later he was knighted by Queen Elizabeth for this work. Today, the method of “DNA fingerprinting” discovered by Sir Alec Jeffreys is used all over the world by forensic scientists. A single drop of blood or a few skin cells left at a crime scene is enough to generate a DNA profile of a suspect, and this profile can be compared to the millions of DNA profiles already collected in databases of convicted offenders. If a match is made, then the name and face of the guilty party is revealed. This criminal DNA profile is not an individual’s entire genome; it is simply a list of numeric values associated with 13 markers (locations) within the genome. These 13 markers were chosen because they show high variability from person to person and because the probability of two persons sharing the same values for all 13 markers is vanishingly small. These 13 markers each contain a short tandem repeat (STR), a string of nucleotides that are repeated a number of times. For example, an STR for one person could look like gatagatagatagatagatagata, where four nucleotides (gata) are repeated 6 times, but for another person gata could be repeated 15 times. The number of repeats varies from person to person, and it’s this repeat number that is included in a person’s DNA profile. A DNA profile contains 13 pairs of numbers (a pair represents heterozygous allelles). These 13 pairs of numbers can be combined in trillions of ways to create trillions of unique profiles. Even if a DNA sample recovered from a crime scene is small and only includes a fraction of the 13 STR regions that are tested, the analysis can still be helpful. DNA profiles were designed to be used for identification purposes only; that is, they were not meant to contain personal genetic information, such as physical traits, tendencies toward diseases, or emotional and intellectual dispositions. This is a genotype-to-genotype comparison. The phenotype of the person (how the genes are expressed to produce physical traits, propensities toward diseases, etc.) is not involved. Think of a driver’s license number or a fingerprint—the number itself or the fingerprint ridge pattern reveals no personal information. The real information (a name, date of birth) is disclosed when a match is made with a record in a database. Likewise, a DNA profile is not meant to reveal personal information itself; it is simply a way to make a match with a preexisting DNA profile in a database. (To clarify, the DNA profile was designed to contain no personal information, but recent studies show this is not true. See more on this topic below.) What happens if there is no match between the DNA profile generated from crime scene evidence and the existing DNA profiles in criminal databases (because the guilty party has no previous record of crime)? If there are no witnesses and no profile-to-profile match, the criminal investigation comes to a standstill. Susan Walsh, a forensic geneticist at Indiana University–Purdue University Indianapolis, would like to move that stalled investigation forward. Working with colleagues in the Netherlands, she helped develop computational models that predict physical traits of a suspect based on DNA left at a crime scene. This process is completely different from generating the standard numerical DNA profile that is used as a reference in databases. Instead Walsh looks at the DNA itself to predict eye color, hair color, and skin color of a suspect. Walsh started with eye color. She and Manfred Kayser, head of the Department of Genetic Identification at Erasmus University Medical Center in Rotterdam, conducted association studies across the genomes of over 9,000 people and found that using just six single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with six genes led to high categorical prediction values for eye color. (A SNP is a variation in just one nucleotide in the genome at a certain location, and SNPs often act as a marker of a gene responsible for a specific trait or disease.) Walsh and Kayser then designed a biological assay and developed a statistical model (using multinomial logistic regression) to predict eye color given an unknown DNA sample. This model is accurate up to 95% of the time in predicting blue or brown eyes. More research needs to be done to discover all the genes associated with eye color, especially for colors that are not blue or brown. Next, with Wojciech Branicki’s research group in Poland, they searched for SNPs associated with hair color and located 22 SNPs associated with 11 genes that gave reasonably high prediction accuracies. They expanded their prediction model to include categories for hair color and have determined that the model is approximately 90% accurate at predicting black hair and 80% accurate at predicting red and brown hair. However, blond hair is more difficult to predict because a number of individuals tend to darken with age, going from blond-haired children to brown- or black-haired adults. At present when tested on over 100 individuals from Europe, the combined model for eye color and hair color—which has been validated by multiple forensic labs—gives an accurate prediction in approximately 75% of cases. Now Walsh, Kayser, and Branicki are working on a model for skin color based on 36 SNPs from 15 genes. The accuracy of this model, using five skin color categories based on a dermatological scale, is in line with hair color prediction. They will publish the work later this year. “Right now it’s a very simple categorical prediction that we can do,” says Walsh, “to get a general description: blue eyes, blond hair, pale skin.” She was recently awarded $1.1 million from the National Institute of Justice, the research and development branch of the US Department of Justice, to expand the model to predict precise quantitative values of color from a palette, which will improve the efficiency of criminal investigations. Walsh clarifies that her method isn’t for all cases and that it is not intended for identification purposes. The predictions won’t stand up in court because eye color and hair color are shared by many people, and hair and skin color can be changed by dyes and by the sun. The purpose of prediction is simply to create a new lead in a cold case, to direct investigators to a new group of suspects. Walsh explains that after suspects are found, “we still need to make a profile-to-profile match” using current DNA analysis. “Perhaps [my model] may lead to a suspect being interrogated, their [DNA] profile received, and a match being found.” Walsh’s next challenge is getting police departments to try these new DNA analysis methods. She says that US law enforcement agencies tend to be conservative in adopting new technology and wait to see it applied elsewhere before trying it themselves. She has begun one pilot study on cold cases with the Indiana State Police, and her tools are being used on a few cases by policing agencies in the Netherlands, Poland, and Australia. “The science has been done; now it’s just up to training and spreading the word that these types of methods can be used, can be trusted, and that they have been validated.” Walsh emphasizes that full disclosure of research methods in DNA phenotyping is crucial, including where samples were collected, the number of samples, the populations they were collected from, which markers were typed, and which individuals were used to generate the statistical models. A number of companies claim they can predict facial features and generate, from a DNA sample, a full-color photograph of an individual, complete with real pigment phenotypes and even a specific hair style, but they do not publish scientific studies nor divulge their “proprietary” software and analysis. She worries that companies like this will damage the reputation of DNA phenotyping. A step beyond predicting eye, hair, and skin color is predicting the detailed appearance of the face. Mark Shriver, geneticist and professor in the anthropology department at Pennsylvania State University, has created a computer model to predict facial shape from DNA alone. Like Walsh, he is not generating the standard DNA profile used in law enforcement databases; he is looking directly at the DNA to reveal physical traits. Working with Peter Claes, biomedical imaging expert at KU Leuven in Belgium, Shriver first collected DNA samples and facial data from volunteers. The facial data accurately describe, in three dimensions, every tiny feature of the face. Using an off-the-shelf 3D surface imaging system with cameras set at different angles, he takes multiple images of a facial pose simultaneously, creating a 3D representation of the face. The computer then marks more than 30,000 vertices on each photograph and, through triangulation, comes up with sets of x, y, z coordinates in three-dimensional space. The software then connects the vertices creating an image that looks like a wire frame. This image gets softened to create a smooth surface, approximating the original face (Figure 1). Claes then designed an algorithm, using dense correspondence analysis, that takes the data output from the imaging system and maps it into a common set of 7,000 facial landmarks, so that advanced statistical analysis can be performed on the dataset. For their first prediction model, Shriver created a list of nearly 200 genes associated with facial development using the Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) catalog. From this list he chose 50 genes that showed accelerated evolution, which could imply that these genes are responsible for visual facial differences between populations. Using DNA and facial data collected from a subset of about 600 African/European mixed persons, he analyzed how these 50 genes affect facial features and discovered 24 SNPs in 20 different genes that significantly demonstrated a pattern of effect on facial shape. Then, going backward, he developed a model to predict the facial shape from DNA alone. Shriver’s model first determines a score for biological sex and ancestry (geographic population group) and from this creates a “base face,” for example, a woman with 85% West African ancestry or a man with 95% European ancestry. Next the model determines the effect of each of the 24 SNPs on this face and layers those effects onto the base face. Shriver and Claes are now working on the third version of their prediction model, using over 1,000 SNPs from hundreds of genes, which they discovered by doing association studies across the genomes of individuals of European ancestry, a subset of the more than 8,000 genomes they have collected from individuals from around the world. Shriver’s biggest challenge is the complexity of the face. For any facial feature, such as the nose, multiple genes affect its shape. In addition, Shriver wants to accurately model each measurement of the nose using continuous data to describe the specific length of the nose, the width of the nostrils, and so on, rather than using broad categories. Furthermore, the face is modular, which means that if a gene affects the shape of the nose, it’s probably also affecting another facial feature. In addition, nongenetic factors—such as age, hormones, and nutrition—contribute significantly to facial shape but cannot be deduced from DNA. (At least not yet; recent studies suggest that DNA methylation markers can be used to predict age.) Shriver estimates that for an adult face 25% of its shape is the effect of biological sex and ancestry, and 15%–20% of its shape is the effect of his 1,000 variants, which means that about 40%–45% of facial features can currently be described by his model. His work is still in the early stages and is not yet ready to be used routinely in law enforcement or intelligence work. However, some scientists are less optimistic that Shriver’s model can predict facial appearance because of the genetics of complex features. Shriver agrees that much more work needs to be done across many fields to improve his model in the hope of applying it to actual criminal cases. “I have a lot of confidence that even in just a few years we’ll be in a position to do this well… and to report what we’re doing in a way that makes it a useful general tool for a lot of cases,” says Shriver. One concern about analyzing crime scene DNA to predict a suspect’s physical coloring and genomic ancestry is that this information could be used for racial profiling. Mark Shriver says that he has come under greater scrutiny than usual for his work and that people have refused to participate as volunteer subjects because they believe his work might add fuel to an already racially biased law enforcement system. Shriver responds: “Some people would say it’s racial profiling to take evidence from a crime scene and make deductions about … what population that person might belong to or come from. If you’re using evidence like that, it’s not racial profiling in the narrow sense. [Racial profiling] is the misuse of patterns or the misuse of somebody’s racial information to dragnet or pull them in for any crime they might have committed, to focus unfairly on a certain population. If there’s evidence from the crime scene, then [a search based on DNA analysis] is not an unfounded focus.” But racial profiling concerns are not just an issue with these newer technologies that predict appearance; these concerns also apply to the current method of creating DNA profiles (the “DNA fingerprint” first discovered by Jeffreys in 1984). DNA profiles were originally designed to contain only “noninteresting” genetic information for identification purposes only, similar to a driver’s license number or fingerprint ridge pattern, which can be matched with a profile in a reference database. Department of Justice regulations specify that a profile generated from a DNA sample must not contain any personal information about physical traits, diseases, and dispositions. However, a study by Bridget Algee-Hewitt, research fellow at Stanford University and soon-to-be professor in the Department of Anthropology at Florida State University, shows that the 13 markers of a traditional DNA profile do in fact contain ancestry (or population) information. Looking at the patterns in the genetic makeup of individuals in a population, Algee-Hewitt and colleagues showed that the highly polymorphic genetic markers in a DNA profile (which are used to provide unique individual identifiability) inherently include ancestry information. This means that, despite the intention of federal regulations, ancestry information can be obtained from the markers. (In 2017 the set of markers will be expanded from 13 to 20; this will create a better identification system but will also provide greater detail related to ancestry.) “If you allow ancestry information to be extracted from the [DNA profile], … then you can start identifying individuals based on features that you might think are associated, or know statistically to be associated, with a particular ancestry group,” says Algee-Hewitt. She explains that a test result stating a person “is likely of African origin” may be translated by nonspecialists into the social language of identity or race, such as “African American” or “black.” This is a result of the practical needs of law enforcement in areas such as eyewitness descriptions, missing person reports, government forms, and census questionnaires, which all use racial terms. Therefore, if ancestry information is pulled from a DNA profile, then law enforcement might make decisions based on predisposed expectations about the link between ancestry and racial/social identity. Algee-Hewitt says this could become “racial profiling at its worst.” She adds: “At its best, however, it could be a way to help exonerate someone.” Science is simply a tool, and it need not be used in support of a racially biased system. It can be used to advance justice and protect the innocent. A 2009 report by the National Academy of Sciences endorsed only one forensic method as rigorous and accurate, DNA analysis. The traditional DNA profile has been consistently and successfully used by the Innocence Project to exonerate individuals falsely incarcerated. Now these newer types of DNA analyses can be employed at the beginning of an investigation to protect the innocent and to reverse inaccurate or racially motivated accusations before a certain group of people is wrongly suspected and questioned. Indeed, the first time Alec Jeffreys was asked to use his new “DNA fingerprinting” technique for a legal case, the test protected an innocent person from a false accusation. It was 1985 and English authorities had detained a 13-year-old boy from Ghana attempting to enter the country to be reunited with his mother. The authorities wanted proof that the boy really was her son and not her nephew. Jeffreys’ test concluded, by an overwhelming probability, that the boy was in fact her son. Forensic tools need not be considered the problem; rather they can be used to help create a more just and hopeful system. Jeffreys understood that his DNA technique advanced justice in a very personal way: “I was actually there when the mother was told … [and] the look in that lady’s eyes was magic,” said Jeffreys in an interview decades later. “Of all the various moments in the DNA fingerprinting story, that has to be my favorite.”"
https://openalex.org/W2515973457,"St. Louis encephalitis virus (SLEV) (Flavivirus) is a reemerging arbovirus in the southern cone of South America. In 2005, an outbreak of SLEV in central Argentina resulted in 47 human cases with 9 deaths. In Argentina, the ecology of SLEV is poorly understood. Because certain birds are the primary amplifiers in North America, we hypothesized that birds amplify SLEV in Argentina as well. We compared avian SLEV seroprevalence in a variety of ecosystems in and around Córdoba city from 2004 (before the epidemic) and 2005 (during the epidemic). We also explored spatial patterns to better understand the local ecology of SLEV transmission. Because West Nile virus (WNV) was also detected in Argentina in 2005, all analyses were also conducted for WNV. A total of 980 birds were sampled for detection of SLEV and WNV neutralizing antibodies. SLEV seroprevalence in birds increased 11-fold from 2004 to 2005. Our study demonstrated that a high proportion (99.3%) of local birds were susceptible to SLEV infection immediately prior to the 2005 outbreak, indicating that the vertebrate host population was primed to amplify SLEV. SLEV was found distributed in a variety of environments throughout the city of Córdoba. However, the force of viral transmission varied among sites. Fine scale differences in populations of vectors and vertebrate hosts would explain this variation. In summary, we showed that in 2005, both SLEV and to a lesser extent WNV circulated in the avian population. Eared Dove, Picui Ground-Dove and Great Kiskadee are strong candidates to amplify SLEV because of their exposure to the pathogen at the population level, and their widespread abundance. For the same reasons, Rufous Hornero may be an important maintenance host for WNV in central Argentina. Competence studies and vector feeding studies are needed to confirm these relationships."
https://openalex.org/W2509950228,"Protein chaperones are molecular machines which function both during homeostasis and stress conditions in all living organisms. Depending on their specific function, molecular chaperones are involved in a plethora of cellular processes by playing key roles in nascent protein chain folding, transport and quality control. Among stress protein families–molecules expressed during adverse conditions, infection, and diseases–chaperones are highly abundant. Their molecular functions range from stabilizing stress-susceptible molecules and membranes to assisting the refolding of stress-damaged proteins, thereby acting as protective barriers against cellular damage. Here we propose a novel technique to test and measure the capability for protective activity of known and putative chaperones in a semi-high throughput manner on a plate reader. The current state of the art does not allow the in vitro measurements of chaperone activity in a highly parallel manner with high accuracy or high reproducibility, thus we believe that the method we report will be of significant benefit in this direction. The use of this method may lead to a considerable increase in the number of experimentally verified proteins with such functions, and may also allow the dissection of their molecular mechanism for a better understanding of their function."
https://openalex.org/W2511029423,"Generating and maintaining gradients of cell density and extracellular matrix (ECM) components is a prerequisite for the development of functionality of healthy tissue. Therefore, gaining insights into the drivers of spatial organization of cells and the role of ECM during tissue morphogenesis is vital. In a 3D model system of tissue morphogenesis, a fibronectin-FRET sensor recently revealed the existence of two separate fibronectin populations with different conformations in microtissues, i.e. ‘compact and adsorbed to collagen’ versus ‘extended and fibrillar’ fibronectin that does not colocalize with the collagen scaffold. Here we asked how the presence of fibronectin might drive this cell-induced tissue morphogenesis, more specifically the formation of gradients in cell density and ECM composition. Microtissues were engineered in a high-throughput model system containing rectangular microarrays of 12 posts, which constrained fibroblast-populated collagen gels, remodeled by the contractile cells into trampoline-shaped microtissues. Fibronectin’s contribution during the tissue maturation process was assessed using fibronectin-knockout mouse embryonic fibroblasts (Fn-/- MEFs) and floxed equivalents (Fnf/f MEFs), in fibronectin-depleted growth medium with and without exogenously added plasma fibronectin (full-length, or various fragments). In the absence of full-length fibronectin, Fn-/- MEFs remained homogenously distributed throughout the cell-contracted collagen gels. In contrast, in the presence of full-length fibronectin, both cell types produced shell-like tissues with a predominantly cell-free compacted collagen core and a peripheral surface layer rich in cells. Single cell assays then revealed that Fn-/- MEFs applied lower total strain energy on nanopillar arrays coated with either fibronectin or vitronectin when compared to Fnf/f MEFs, but that the presence of exogenously added plasma fibronectin rescued their contractility. While collagen decoration of single fibronectin fibers enhanced the non-persistent migration of both Fnf/f and Fn-/- MEFs, the migration speed was increased for Fn-/- MEFs on plasma fibronectin fibers compared to Fnf/f MEFs. In contrast, the average speed was the same for all cells on collagen-coated Fn fibers. A Fn-FRET sensor revealed that fibronectin on average was more extended on the microtissue surface compared to fibronectin in the core. Gradients of collagen-to-fibronectin ratios and of the fraction of collagen-adsorbed to stretched fibrillar fibronectin conformations might thereby provide critical cell migration cues. This study highlights a dominant role for fibronectin in tissue morphogenesis and the development of tissue heterogeneities."
https://openalex.org/W2511458859,"Elevated plasma levels of inorganic phosphate (Pi) are harmful, causing, among other complications, vascular calcification and defective insulin secretion. The underlying molecular mechanisms of these complications remain poorly understood. We demonstrated the role of Pi transport across the plasmalemma on Pi toxicity in INS-1E rat clonal β cells and rat pancreatic islet cells. Type III sodium-phosphate cotransporters (NaPis) are the predominant Pi transporters expressed in insulin-secreting cells. Transcript and protein levels of sodium-dependent phosphate transporter 1 and 2 (PiT-1 and -2), isotypes of type III NaPi, were up-regulated by high-Pi incubation. In patch-clamp experiments, extracellular Pi elicited a Na+-dependent, inwardly rectifying current, which was markedly reduced under acidic extracellular conditions. Cellular uptake of Pi elicited cytosolic alkalinization; intriguingly, this pH change facilitated Pi transport into the mitochondrial matrix. Increased mitochondrial Pi uptake accelerated superoxide generation, mitochondrial permeability transition (mPT), and endoplasmic reticulum stress-mediated translational attenuation, leading to reduced insulin content and impaired glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. Silencing of PiT-1/2 prevented Pi-induced superoxide generation and mPT, and restored insulin secretion. We propose that Pi transport across the plasma membrane and consequent cytosolic alkalinization could be a therapeutic target for protection from Pi toxicity in insulin-secreting cells, as well as in other cell types.-Nguyen, T.

It has also been a major focus of structural and functional studies and an important target of antibiotics. Here we report our attempts to biochemically reconstitute mycobacterial protein translation in vitro from purified components. This mycobacterial translation system consists of individually purified recombinant translation factors from Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tuberculosis), purified tRNAs and ribosomes from Mycobacterium smegmatis (M. smegmatis), and an aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase (AARS) mixture from the cell-extract of M. smegmatis. We demonstrate that such mycobacterial translation system was efficient in in vitro protein synthesis, and enabled functional comparisons of translational components between the gram-positive Mycobacterium and the gram-negative E. coli. Although mycobacterial translation factors and ribosomes were highly compatible with their E. coli counterparts, M. smegmatis tRNAs were not properly charged by the E. coli AARSs to allow efficient translation of a reporter. In contrast, both E. coli and M. smegmatis tRNAs exhibited similar activity with the semi-purified M. smegmatis AARSs mixture for in vitro translation. We further demonstrated the use of both mycobacterial and E. coli translation systems as comparative in vitro assays for small-molecule antibiotics that target protein translation. While mycobacterial and E. coli translation were both inhibited at the same IC50 by the antibiotic spectinomycin, mycobacterial translation was preferentially inhibited by the antibiotic tetracycline, suggesting that there may be structural differences at the antibiotic binding sites between the ribosomes of Mycobacterium and E. coli. Our results illustrate an alternative approach for antibiotic discovery and functional studies of protein translation in mycobacteria and possibly other bacterial pathogens."
https://openalex.org/W2511178450,"Plants have evolved elaborate mechanisms controlling developmental responses to environmental stimuli. A particularly important stimulus is temperature. Previous work has identified the interplay of PIF4 and ELF3 as a central circuit underlying thermal responses in Arabidopsis thaliana. However, thermal responses vary widely among strains, possibly offering mechanistic insights into the wiring of this circuit. ELF3 contains a polyglutamine (polyQ) tract that is crucial for ELF3 function and varies in length across strains. Here, we use transgenic analysis to test the hypothesis that natural polyQ variation in ELF3 is associated with the observed natural variation in thermomorphogenesis. We found little evidence that the polyQ tract plays a specific role in thermal responses beyond modulating general ELF3 function. Instead, we made the serendipitous discovery that ELF3 plays a crucial, PIF4-independent role in thermoresponsive flowering under conditions more likely to reflect field conditions. We present evidence that ELF3 acts through the photoperiodic pathway, pointing to a previously unknown symmetry between low and high ambient temperature responses. Moreover, in analyzing two strain backgrounds with different thermal responses, we demonstrate that responses may be shifted rather than fundamentally rewired across strains. Our findings tie together disparate observations into a coherent framework in which multiple pathways converge in accelerating flowering in response to temperature, with some such pathways modulated by photoperiod."
https://openalex.org/W2516075959,"The Escherichia coli bacteriophage P1 encodes a site-specific recombinase called Cre and two 34-bp target sites of Cre recombinase called loxP. The Cre/loxP system has been used to achieve targeted insertion and precise deletion in many animal and plant genomes. The Cre/loxP system has particularly been used for the removal of selectable marker genes to create marker-free transgenic organisms. For the first time, we applied the Cre/loxP-mediated site-specific recombination system to Chlamydomonas reinhardtii to construct marker-free transgenic strains. Specifically, C. reinhardtii strains cc4350 and cc124 carrying an aphVIII expression cassette flanked by two direct repeats of loxP were constructed. Separately, a synthetic Cre recombinase gene (CrCRE), the codons of which were optimized for expression in C. reinhardtii, was synthesized, and a CrCRE expression cassette was introduced into strain cc4350 carrying a single copy of the loxP-flanked aphVIII expression cassette. Among 46 transformants carrying the CrCRE expression cassette stably, the excision of aphVIII by CrCre recombinase was observed only in one transformant. We then constructed an expression cassette of an in-frame fusion of ble to CrCRE via a short linker peptide. The product of ble (Ble) is a bleomycin-binding protein that confers resistance to bleomycin-related antibiotics such as Zeocin and localizes in the nucleus. Therefore, the ble-(linker)-CrCRE fusion protein is expected to localize in the nucleus. When the ble-(linker)-CrCRE expression cassette was integrated into the genome of strain cc4350 carrying a single copy of the loxP-flanked aphVIII expression cassette, CrCre recombinase-mediated excision of the aphVIII expression cassette was observed at a frequency higher than that in stable transformants of the CrCRE expression cassette. Similarly, from strain cc124 carrying a single loxP-flanked aphVIII expression cassette, the aphVIII expression cassette was successfully excised after introduction of the ble-(linker)-CrCRE expression cassette. The ble-(linker)-CrCRE expression cassette remained in the genome after excision of the aphVIII expression cassette, and it was subsequently removed by crossing with the wild-type strain. This precise Cre-mediated deletion method applicable to transgenic C. reinhardtii could further increase the potential of this organism for use in basic and applied research."
https://openalex.org/W2511798018,"Gee’s golden langur (Trachypithecus geei) is an endangered colobine primate, endemic to the semi-evergreen and mixed-deciduous forests of Indo-Bhutan border. During the last few decades, extensive fragmentation has caused severe population decline and local extinction of golden langur from several fragments. However, no studies are available on the impact of habitat fragmentation and the genetic diversity of golden langur in the fragmented habitats. The present study aimed to estimate the genetic diversity in the Indian population of golden langur. We sequenced and analyzed around 500 bases of the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) hypervariable region-I from 59 fecal samples of wild langur collected from nine forest fragments. Overall, genetic diversity was high (h = 0.934, π = 0.0244) and comparable with other colobines. Populations in smaller fragments showed lower nucleotide diversity compared to the larger forest fragments. The median-joining network of haplotypes revealed a genetic structure that corresponded with the geographical distribution. The Aie and Champabati Rivers were found to be a barrier to gene flow between golden langur populations. In addition, it also established that T. geei is monophyletic but revealed possible hybridization with capped langur, T. pileatus, in the wild. It is hoped that these findings would result in a more scientific approach towards managing the fragmented populations of this enigmatic species."

The effects of multilevel facetectomy and screw density on postoperative changes in spinal rod contour have not been documented. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of multilevel facetectomy and screw density on changes in spinal rod contour from before implantation to after surgical correction of thoracic curves in patients with AIS prospectively. The concave and convex rod shapes from patients with thoracic AIS (n = 49) were traced prior to insertion. Postoperative sagittal rod shape was determined by computed tomography. The angle of intersection of the tangents to the rod end points was measured. Multiple stepwise linear regression analysis was used to identify variables independently predictive of change in rod contour (Δθ). Average Δθ at the concave and convex side were 13.6° ± 7.5° and 4.3° ± 4.8°, respectively. The Δθ at the concave side was significantly greater than that of the convex side (P < 0.0001) and significantly correlated with Risser sign (P = 0.032), the preoperative main thoracic Cobb angle (P = 0.031), the preoperative TK angle (P = 0.012), and the number of facetectomy levels (P = 0.007). Furthermore, a Δθ at the concave side ≥14° significantly correlated with the postoperative TK angle (P = 0.003), the number of facetectomy levels (P = 0.021), and screw density at the concave side (P = 0.008). Rod deformation at the concave side suggests that corrective forces acting on that side are greater than on the convex side. Multilevel facetectomy and/or screw density at the concave side have positive effects on reducing the rod deformation that can lead to a loss of TK angle postoperatively."

However, about half of the patients with ScAb-ILD were male and current or ex-smokers. On HRCT analysis, honeycombing was more predominant in patients with ScAb-ILD than with SSc-ILD. Pathological analysis showed the severity of vascular intimal or medial thickening in the SSc-ILD patients to be significantly higher than that in the ScAb-ILD patients. Survival curves showed that the patients with ScAb-ILD had a significantly poorer outcome than those with SSc-ILD.Data from this study suggest that lung-dominant CTD with SSc-related autoantibody is a different disease entity from SSc-ILD."

In mice, Coro1A has been associated with resistance to autoimmunity. A nonsense mutation of Coro1a has been identified to suppress disease development in a mouse model of lupus erythematosus (15.Haraldsson M.K. Louis-Dit-Sully C.A. Lawson B.R. Sternik G.

Furthermore, Coro1a-deficient mice develop no or only mild symptoms of autoimmunity when immunized with the myelin oligoglycoprotein (MOG) peptide to induce experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a common murine model of multiple sclerosis (14.Kaminski S. Hermann-Kleiter N. Meisel M. Thuille N. Cronin S. Hara H. Fresser F. Penninger J.M. Baier G.

Immunol. 2011; 186: 3452-3461Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). MOG-induced EAE is considered a predominantly T cell-mediated disease, in which MOG-specific naive T cells are activated and expanded during the early phase of the immune response in lymph nodes draining the immunization site. Subsequently, the differentiated effector T cells invade the central nervous system (CNS), where they initiate the recruitment of other inflammatory immune cells such as neutrophils and macrophages. Nevertheless, B cells are also discussed to contribute to the pathogenesis either by secreting autoantibodies, presenting antigens to T cells, or by suppressing effector responses. Furthermore, dendritic cells as professional antigen-presenting cells (APC) are crucial for the priming of T cells in lymphoid organs and in addition to reactivate T cells in the CNS. Thus, besides T cells, several different populations of immune cells may contribute to the inflammatory response leading to neuronal damage and resulting in symptoms of ascending flaccid paralysis (see Ref. 18.Batoulis H. Addicks K. Kuerten S. Emerging concepts in autoimmune encephalomyelitis beyond the CD4/T(H)1 paradigm.Ann. Anat. 2010; 192: 179-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar for a comprehensive review). Given the abundant expression of Coro1A in many different immune cell types, the question remains of whether the phenotype of Coro1a-deficient mice can be attributed predominately to its role in T cells. Moreover, it has not been proven that the paucity of peripheral T cells observed in conventional Coro1a-deficient mice is caused by a T cell intrinsic role of Coro1A or a lack of Coro1A expression in other leukocyte subsets. To address these points, we have generated mice lacking Coro1A expression specifically in T cells and analyzed their immune status as well as their susceptibility to the induction of EAE by immunization with the MOG peptide. Our results suggest a predominant T cell-intrinsic role of Coro1A responsible for peripheral T cell homeostasis and resistance to the development of severe EAE. Coro1A, which has been implicated as an important regulator of T cell functions by several studies analyzing conventional (whole body) Coro1a knock-out mice or natural mutants, is highly expressed in all leukocyte subsets (with the exception of Kupffer cells). Nevertheless, it is currently not clear whether the expression of Coro1A in T cells or other leukocyte subsets such as APCs accounts for the strong reduction of T cell counts observed with conventional knock-out mice. To address this research question, T cell-specific Coro1a knock-out mice were generated in our laboratory by crossing Coro1aflox/flox mice harboring loxP sites after exon 1 and 10 of the coro1a gene to Cd4-Cre transgenic mice (Tg(Cd4-cre)1Cwi/BfluJ) containing CD4 enhancer, promoter, and silencer sequences driving the expression of a Cre recombinase gene (Fig. 1A). To determine the efficiency as well as specificity of Coro1a deletion, offspring expressing the Cre recombinase together with either a wild-type (“Cd4-Cre”) or floxed version of the Coro1a gene (“Cd4-Cre × Coro1aflox/flox”) along with conventional Coro1a knock-out mice (“Coro1a−/−”) were analyzed for Coro1A protein expression. The Coro1A protein expression level in sorted CD4+/CD8+ T cells isolated from Cd4-Cre × Coro1aflox/flox mice was strongly reduced (to less than 10%) when compared with Cd4-Cre mice by SDS-PAGE gel and Western blotting analysis using a monoclonal antibody against Coro1A (Fig. 1B). Remarkably, as few as 1 × 105 T cells isolated from Cd4-Cre mice gave a very strong band for Coro1A on immunoblots, emphasizing that Coro1A is abundantly expressed in T cells. As expected, no Coro1A protein was detected with T cells of Coro1a−/− mice, also confirming the specificity of the monoclonal antibody, which is raised against human CORO1A but also detects its highly conserved mouse homologue. To determine Coro1A expression on the single cell level, and thus the specificity of Coro1a deletion by the Cre recombinase in lymphocyte subsets, splenocytes of all three genotypes were analyzed by flow cytometry. Because no fluorochrome-labeled anti-Coro1A antibody was commercially available, we used the same monoclonal antibody that has been applied for immunoblotting in combination with Zenon technology (see “Experimental Procedures”). We chose this approach because it should result in less unspecific background staining than using fluorochrome-labeled secondary antibodies. The results with splenocytes from Coro1a−/− mice, showing negligible “false Coro1A-positive” CD4+ T cells, and a clear positive population with splenocytes from Cd4-Cre mice, indicated that the intracellular Coro1A staining was working well (Fig. 1C). Although all CD3+ (CD4+ and CD4−) from Cd4-Cre control mice express Coro1A, Coro1A-positve CD4+ T cells were almost absent in CD4+ T cells from Cd4-Cre × Coro1aflox/flox mice. To allow for a better comparison between the genotypes, the mean fluorescent intensity of Coro1A staining of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells as well as CD3− splenocytes from control Cd4-Cre control mice was set to 100%. The Coro1A expression of CD4+ T cells from conditional knock-out mice reached almost full knock-out level. Furthermore, CD8+ T cells showed a strong reduction in Coro1A expression with on average 20% of the value obtained for control mice. In contrast, CD3− splenocytes, which are not expected to express the Cre recombinase, had Coro1A expression levels close to the control Cd4-Cre mice. With the generation of this T cell-specific Coro1a knock-out line a valuable tool to address the role of Coro1A in T cells is now available. The major phenotype of conventional Coro1a knock-out mice is a strong reduction of naive CD4+ T cells in peripheral organs, whereas thymic counts and subset frequency are not affected (12.Mueller P. Massner J. Jayachandran R. Combaluzier B. Albrecht I. Gatfield J. Blum C. Ceredig R. Rodewald H.R. Rolink A.G. Pieters J. Regulation of T cell survival through coronin-1-mediated generation of inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate and calcium mobilization after T cell receptor triggering.Nat. Immunol. 2008; 9: 424-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Although comparing conventional and T cell-specific Coro1a knock-out mice along with Cd4-Cre control mice, no significant difference in thymic counts was observed (Fig. 2A). Also, subset frequencies (DN, DP, and CD4/8 SP), which were analyzed by flow cytometry, were comparable between the three genotypes (Fig. 2B). Thus, similar to the conditional Coro1a knock-out mice, deletion of Coro1a in thymocytes at the CD4/8 double-positive stage does not affect thymocyte development. Nevertheless, the deletion of Coro1a, either the germline or specifically in T cells, strongly reduced the frequency of CD3+ T cells in the spleen even though total splenocyte numbers were not affected (Fig. 3A). On the other hand, the percentage of CD19+ B cells in both Coro1a knock-out lines was enhanced; most likely attributed to the lymphopenic environment in Coro1a-deficient animals. Additional flow cytometric analyses of the peripheral T cell compartment revealed that especially the CD4+ T cell compartment was affected by deletion of Coro1a, leading to a reduced percentage of CD4+ T cells in both knock-out lines (Fig. 3B). Interestingly, whereas the percentage of CD4+ T cells was not significantly different between germline and T cell-specific Coro1a deletion, the frequency of CD8+ T cells was increased in the spleen of conventional but not of T cell-specific Coro1a knock-out mice. This difference between both Coro1a knock-out lines in regard to CD4+ and CD8+ cell frequency is further illustrated by the significantly lower CD4:CD8 ratio in the spleen of conventional Coro1a knock-out mice. As mentioned above, the main subset affected by Coro1a deletion seems to be naive CD4+ T cells. Therefore, this subset was analyzed by flow cytometry using CD62L and CD44 to distinguish naive and effector/memory T cells. T cell-specific deletion of Coro1a resulted in a strong reduction of naive CD4+ T cells and induced a shift toward an effector/memory phenotype. However, these changes were less pronounced than observed for CD4+ T cells from conventional Coro1a knock-out mice (Fig. 4). The most striking phenotype of conventional Coro1a knock-out mice was their resistance to EAE induction using the MOG(35–55) peptide-based protocol (14.Kaminski S. Hermann-Kleiter N. Meisel M. Thuille N. Cronin S. Hara H. Fresser F. Penninger J.M. Baier G. Coronin 1A is an essential regulator of the TGFβ receptor/SMAD3 signaling pathway in Th17 CD4(+) T cells.J.

Coronin 1-mediated naive T cell survival is essential for the development of autoimmune encephalomyelitis.J. Immunol. 2011; 186: 3452-3461Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Given the similar phenotype of mice harboring either T cell-specific or germline deletion of Coro1a, we expected that deletion of Coro1a in T cells would also confer protection in this model of autoimmunity. This was indeed observed when the three genotypes were immunized with the MOG(35–55) peptide and disease progression was monitored: mice lacking Coro1a only in T cells were as well protected as mice lacking Coro1a in all their cells (Fig. 5). In summary, our results show a predominant T cell intrinsic role of Coro1A with regard to T cell function. Several studies have associated mutations in the Coro1a gene with resistance to autoimmunity. A nonsense mutation that had arisen spontaneously has been identified as a disease-suppressing allele in lupus-prone Faslpr mice (15.Haraldsson M.K. Louis-Dit-Sully C.A. Lawson B.R. Sternik G. Santiago-Raber M.L. Gascoigne N.R. Theofilopoulos A.N. Kono D.H. The lupus-related Lmb3 locus contains a disease-suppressing Coronin-1A gene mutation.Immunity. 2008; 28: 40-51Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). This point mutation introduces a stop codon in the middle of the protein, leading to a truncated version of Coro1A, which fails to localize to the plasma membrane. Furthermore, conventional Coro1a-deficient mice, generated independently in distinct laboratories, were protected against the development of severe signs of EAE induced by immunization with the MOG peptide (14.Kaminski S. Hermann-Kleiter N. Meisel M. Thuille N. Cronin S. Hara H. Fresser F. Penninger J.M. Baier G. Coronin 1A is an essential regulator of the TGFβ receptor/SMAD3 signaling pathway in Th17 CD4(+) T cells.J. Autoimmun. 2011; 37: 198-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 17.Siegmund K. Zeis T. Kunz G. Rolink T. Schaeren-Wiemers N. Pieters J. Coronin 1-mediated naive T cell survival is essential for the development of autoimmune encephalomyelitis.J. Immunol. 2011; 186: 3452-3461Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). This phenotype has been attributed to alterations of intrinsic T cell function, namely impaired migration, cell activation, and survival. Of note, however, those mouse strains lack functional Coro1A in all their cells. Our results obtained with mice lacking Coro1a specifically in T cells support the notion of a predominant T cell intrinsic role of Coro1A underlying the resistance to autoimmunity. Thus, similarly to conventional Coro1a-deficient mice, Cd4-cre × Coro1aflox/flox mice show strongly reduced peripheral CD4+ and CD8+ T cell counts and are largely protected from the induction of EAE. Before conditional Coro1a-deficient mice were generated, the conclusion that T cell intrinsic Coro1A accounts for reduced susceptibility of autoimmunity was drawn mainly from transfer experiments. On one hand, the transfer of T cells baring the point mutation described above was sufficient to reduce lupus-like diseases (15.Haraldsson M.K. Louis-Dit-Sully C.A. Lawson B.R. Sternik G. Santiago-Raber M.L. Gascoigne N.R. Theofilopoulos A.N. Kono D.H. The lupus-related Lmb3 locus contains a disease-suppressing Coronin-1A gene mutation.Immunity. 2008; 28: 40-51Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the transfer of wild-type CD4+ T cells before immunization did restore the susceptibility of Coro1a-deficient mice to EAE induction (17.Siegmund K. Zeis T. Kunz G. Rolink T. Schaeren-Wiemers N. Pieters J. Coronin 1-mediated naive T cell survival is essential for the development of autoimmune encephalomyelitis.J. Immunol. 2011; 186: 3452-3461Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The later experimental approach suggests that Coro1a-deficient APCs are fully capable of priming T cells and promoting effector T cell differentiation as long as those T cells express Coro1A. The assumption that Coro1A is dispensable for antigen presentation and T cell activation by APCs is further supported by the observation that bone marrow-derived dendritic cells induce antigen-specific T cell proliferation regardless of Coro1A expression (8.Westritschnig K. BoseDasgupta S. Tchang V. Siegmund K. Pieters J. Antigen processing and presentation by dendritic cells is independent of coronin 1.Mol. Immunol. 2013; 53: 379-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Thus, it seems that Coro1A expression in T cells rather than in APCs is essential for the activation of autoantigen-specific T cells and the development of symptoms of EAE. This is in accordance with our results of T cell-specific Coro1a-deficient mice being largely resistant to EAE induction. It is believed that myelin-specific T cells, which have escaped central tolerance, are present in the peripheral T cell pool in a state of ignorance (19.Seamons A. Perchellet A. Goverman J. Immune tolerance to myelin proteins.Immunol. Res. 2003; 28: 201-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) and, in addition, their activation is prevented by Tregs (17.Siegmund K. Zeis T. Kunz G. Rolink T. Schaeren-Wiemers N. Pieters J. Coronin 1-mediated naive T cell survival is essential for the development of autoimmune encephalomyelitis.J.

Immunol. 2009; 39: 1108-1117Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Therefore, the balance between distinct T cell subsets may dictate disease outcome after immunization with myelin-derived peptides. In this regard, it is worth noting that an increased Treg/naive T cell ratio was observed in the absence of Coro1a, in conditional as well as T cell-specific knock-out mice (see Ref. 17.Siegmund K. Zeis T. Kunz G. Rolink T. Schaeren-Wiemers N. Pieters J. Coronin 1-mediated naive T cell survival is essential for the development of autoimmune encephalomyelitis.J. Immunol. 2011; 186: 3452-3461Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar; data not shown). However, whereas the transfer of wild-type CD4+ T cells did impact on EAE development, the depletion of CD25+ Tregs did not restore disease susceptibility (17.Siegmund K. Zeis T. Kunz G. Rolink T. Schaeren-Wiemers N. Pieters J. Coronin 1-mediated naive T cell survival is essential for the development of autoimmune encephalomyelitis.J. Immunol. 2011; 186: 3452-3461Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), indicating that resistance to EAE in the absence of Coro1a is most likely caused by disturbed naive T cell priming. Unexpectedly, considering the decreased EAE symptoms upon primary immunization with the MOG peptide, Coro1a-deficient mice not only overcome the defect observed during initial induction, but also demonstrate hypersusceptibility upon the reinduction of EAE (14.Kaminski S. Hermann-Kleiter N. Meisel M. Thuille N. Cronin S. Hara H. Fresser F. Penninger J.M. Baier G.

https://openalex.org/W2513083400,"Retinol (ROL), the alcohol form of vitamin A, is known to control cell fate decision of various types of stem cells in the form of its active metabolite, retinoic acid (RA). However, little is known about whether ROL has regulatory effects on colonic stem cells. We examined in this study the effect of ROL on the growth of murine normal colonic cells cultured as organoids. As genes involved in RA synthesis from ROL were differentially expressed along the length of the colon, we tested the effect of ROL on proximal and distal colon organoids separately. We found that organoid forming efficiency and the expression level of Lgr5, a marker gene for colonic stem cells were significantly enhanced by ROL in the proximal colon organoids, but not in the distal ones. Interestingly, neither retinaldehyde (RAL), an intermediate product of the ROL-RA pathway, nor RA exhibited growth promoting effects on the proximal colon organoids, suggesting that ROL-dependent growth enhancement in organoids involves an RA-independent mechanism. This was confirmed by the observation that an inhibitor for RA-mediated gene transcription did not abrogate the effect of ROL on organoids. This novel role of ROL in stem cell maintenance in the proximal colon provides insights into the mechanism of region-specific regulation for colonic stem cell maintenance."
https://openalex.org/W2509570897,"Background Dedicated pediatricians in emergency departments (EDs) may be beneficial, though no previous studies have assessed the related costs and benefits/harms. We aimed to evaluate the net benefits and costs of dedicated emergency pediatricians in a pediatric ED. Methods Cost-consequences analysis of visits to a pediatric ED of a tertiary hospital. Two pediatric ED Medical Teams (MT) were compared: MT-A (May–September 2012), with general pediatrics physicians only; and MT-B (May–September 2013), with emergency dedicated pediatricians. The main outcomes analyzed were relevant clinical outcomes, patient throughput time and costs. Results We included 8,694 children in MT-A and 9,417 in MT-B. Medication use in the ED increased from 42.3% of the children in MT-A to 49.6% in MT-B; diagnostic tests decreased from 24.2% in MT-A to 14.3% in MT-B. Hospitalization increased from 1.3% in MT-A to 3.0% in MT-B; however, there was no significant difference in diagnosis-related group relative weight of hospitalized children in MT-A and MT-B (MT-A, 0.979; MT-B, 1.075). No differences were observed in ED readmissions or in patients leaving without being seen by a physician. The patient throughput time was significantly shorter in MT-B, with faster times to first medical observation. Within the cost domains analyzed, the total expenditures per children observed in the ED were 16% lower in MT-B: 37.87 euros in MT-A; 31.97 euros in MT-B. Conclusion The presence of dedicated emergency pediatricians in a pediatric ED was associated with significantly lower waiting times in the ED, reduced costs, and similar clinical outcomes."

Recent studies suggest that epigenetic regulation of microRNAs might play a role in its development. In this paper we present the application of a complex computational pipeline to perform enrichment analysis of miRNAs in pathways applied to the study of BOS. The analysis considered the full set of miRNAs annotated in miRBase (version 21), and applied a sequence of filtering approaches and statistical analyses to reduce this set and to score the candidate miRNAs according to their potential involvement in BOS development. Dysregulation of two of the selected candidate miRNAs-miR-34a and miR-21 -was clearly shown in in-situ hybridization (ISH) on five explanted human BOS lungs and on a rat model of acute and chronic lung rejection, thus definitely identifying miR-34a and miR-21 as pathogenic factors in BOS and confirming the effectiveness of the computational pipeline."

We generated two immunodeficient strains with severe combined B- and T-cell immunodeficiency with or without a complete lack of natural killer cells to revisit the role of adaptive immune responses on atherogenesis. C-Ldlr-/- Rag1-/- mice, which show severe combined B- and T-cell immunodeficiency and C-Ldlr-/- Rag1-/- Il2rg-/- mice, which combine the T- and B-cell defect with a complete lack of natural killer cells and inactivation of multiple cytokine signalling pathways were fed an atherogenic Western type diet (WTD). Both B6-Ldlr-/- and C-Ldlr-/- immunocompetent mice were used as controls. Body weights and serum cholesterol levels of both immunodeficient strains were significantly increased compared to C-Ldlr-/- controls, except for cholesterol levels of C-Ldlr-/- Rag1-/- double mutants after 12 weeks on the WTD. Quantification of the aortic sinus plaque area revealed that both strains of immunodeficient mice developed significantly more atherosclerosis compared to C-Ldlr-/- controls after 24 weeks on the WTD. Increased atherosclerotic lesion development in C-Ldlr-/- Rag1-/- Il2rg-/- triple mutants was associated with significantly increased numbers of macrophages and significantly decreased numbers of smooth muscle cells compared to both C-Ldlr-/- wild type and C-Ldlr-/- Rag1-/- double mutants pointing to a plaque destabilizing effect of NK cell loss. Collectively, the present study reveals a previously unappreciated complexity with regard to the impact of lymphocytes on lipoprotein metabolism and the role of lymphocyte subsets in plaque composition."

Identity-based cryptography, an increasingly popular branch of cryptography, is widely used to protect the information confidentiality in the critical infrastructure sector due to the ability to directly compute the user's public key based on the user's identity. However, computational requirements complicate the practical application of Identity-based cryptography. In order to improve the efficiency of identity-based cryptography, this paper presents an effective method to construct pairing-friendly elliptic curves with low hamming weight 4 under embedding degree 1. Based on the analysis of the Complex Multiplication(CM) method, the soundness of our method to calculate the characteristic of the finite field is proved. And then, three relative algorithms to construct pairing-friendly elliptic curve are put forward. 10 elliptic curves with low hamming weight 4 under 160 bits are presented to demonstrate the utility of our approach. Finally, the evaluation also indicates that it is more efficient to compute Tate pairing with our curves, than that of Bertoni et al."
https://openalex.org/W2512674958,"The purpose of this study was to examine the retinas of mice carrying hemizygous and null double deletions of Cfb-/- and Cfh-/-, and to compare these with the single knockouts of Cfb, Cfh and Cfd. Retinas were isolated from wild type (WT), Cfb-/-/Cfh-/-, Cfb-/-/Cfh+/-, Cfh-/-/Cfb+/-, Cfb-/-, Cfh-/- Cfd-/-, and Cfd+/- mice. Complement proteins were evaluated by western blotting, ELISA and immunocytochemistry, and retinal morphology was assessed using toluidine blue stained semi-thin sections. WT mice showed staining for C3 and its breakdown products in the retinal vasculature and the basal surface of the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). Cfb-/- mice exhibited a similar C3 staining pattern to WT in the retinal vessels but a decrease in C3 and its breakdown products at the basal surface of the RPE. Deletion of both Cfb and Cfh restored C3 to levels similar to those observed in WT mice, however this reversal of phenotype was not observed in Cfh-/-/Cfb+/- or Cfb-/-/Cfh+/- mice. Loss of CFD caused an increase in C3 and a decrease in C3 breakdown products along the basal surface of the RPE. Overall the retinal morphology and retinal vasculature did not appear different across the various genotypes. We observed that C3 accumulates at the basal RPE in Cfb-/-, Cfb-/-/Cfh-/-, Cfb-/-/Cfh+/-, Cfd-/- and WT mice, but is absent in Cfh-/- and Cfh-/-/Cfb+/- mice, consistent with its consumption in the serum of mice lacking CFH when CFB is present. C3 breakdown products along the surface of the RPE were either decreased or absent when CFB, CFH or CFD was deleted or partially deleted."
https://openalex.org/W2517300537,"Low circulating levels of vitamin D and high mammographic density (MD) have been associated with higher risk of breast cancer. Although some evidence suggested an inverse association between circulating vitamin D and MD, no studies have investigated this association among Mexican women. We examined whether serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 [25(OH)D3] levels were associated with MD in a cross-sectional study nested within the large Mexican Teacher's Cohort. This study included 491 premenopausal women with a mean age of 42.9 years. Serum 25(OH)D3 levels were measured by liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry. Linear regression and non-linear adjusted models were used to estimate the association of MD with serum 25(OH)D3. Median serum 25(OH)D3 level was 27.3 (23.3-32.8) (ng/ml). Forty one (8%) women had 25(OH)D3 levels in the deficient range (< 20 ng/ml). Body mass index (BMI) and total physical activity were significantly correlated with 25(OH)D3 (r = -0.109, P = 0.019 and r = 0.095, P = 0.003, respectively). In the multivariable linear regression, no significant association was observed between 25(OH)D3 levels and MD overall. However, in stratified analyses, higher serum 25(OH)D3 levels (≥27.3 ng/ml) were significantly inversely associated with percent MD among women with BMI below the median (β = -0.52, P = 0.047). Although no significant association was observed between serum 25(OH)D3 and percent MD in the overall population, specific subgroups of women may benefit from higher serum 25(OH)D3 levels."
