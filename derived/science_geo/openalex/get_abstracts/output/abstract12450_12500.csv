https://openalex.org/W2082749146,"Large, homogeneously staining chromosome regions which lack the longitudinal differentiation ordinarily revealed by cytogenetic ""banding"" methods have been found in antifolate-resistant Chinese hamster cells and also in human neuroblastoma cells established in vitro. The drug-resistant cells are characterized by excessive production of the target enzyme, dihydrofolate reductase, while the human neuroblastoma cells have phenotypes of normal neuronal cells. The homogeneously staining region appears to represent a novel metaphase chromosome anomaly which may have functional significance in cells with specialized properties."
https://openalex.org/W2095491217,"Administration of 6-hydroxydopamine to neonatal rats produces a rapid and profound depletion of brain dopamine. Total activity of treated animals is significantly greater than that of controls between 12 and 22 days of age, but then declines, an activity pattern similar to that seen in affected children. This suggests a functional deficiency of brain dopamine in the pathogenesis of minimal brain dysfunction."

Entrainment of these rhythms by light cycles fails in lesioned hamsters; females become persistently estrous; in both sexes locomotor activity becomes sporadic, confined primarily to the light instead of darkness, and is totally arrhythmic when lesioned animals are exposed to continuous darkness; the photoperiodic gonadal response (gonadal regression induced by short day lengths) is abolished; lesioned animals remain reproductively mature irrespective of photoperiodic treatment."

https://openalex.org/W1555545406,"The methotrexate-resistant AT-3000 line of S-180 cells has at least 150-fold more immunologically cross-reactive folate reductase than sensitive cells. Highly specific immunologic and protein purification procedures were used to show that the increased enzyme levels in this line are due to a corresponding increase in the rate of folate reductase synthesis. This observation indicates that the relative turnover of the enzyme is not significantly different in the two lines. Folate reductase was purified to homogeneity from both the sensitive and the methotrexate-resistant cells. Comparison of various physical, kinetic, and immunochemical properties of the enzymes revealed no differences. These observations suggest that the AT-3000 line contains one or more regulatory variations leading to the over-production of folate reductase protein that is similar, if not identical, to that produced by sensitive cells. In resistant cells, specific immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated that folate reductase comprises as much as 7 to 8% of the continuously labeled soluble protein and 6 to 7% of the soluble protein synthesis. Growth of these lines in the absence of methotrexate resulted in a slow decrease in the level of folate reductase to less than 1%. This decrease corresponded to a similar decrease in the relative rate of enzyme synthesis. Variations in the level of folate reductase with cell growth are also due to changes in the relative rate of enzyme synthesis. In the AT-3000 line, pulse decay experiments showed that the half-life of folate reductase was long (50 hours) relative to cell doubling time (24 hours), and also that methotrexate had little or no effect on the turnover of the enzyme. Comparison of the incorporation of radioactive leucine into folate reductase in continuous and pulse labeling experiments gave independent confirmation of these results. Therefore, the relative rate of folate reductase synthesis was the major parameter determining the amount of folate reductase under all examined conditions that resulted in altered levels of the enzyme in resistant cells."
https://openalex.org/W1557706683,"Analysis of HeLa non-histone chromosomal protein by two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis has revealed more than 450 components, most of which are rare (less than 10,000 copies/cell) and are not detectable in cytoplasm. Chromatin prepared from nuclei isolated by a nonaqueous technique contains essentially all of the proteins found in chromatin from aqueous nuclei, implying that cytoplasmic contamination is not significant. The complexity of chromatin is comparable to that of cytoplasm (500 proteins detected) and greater than that of nucleoplasm (300 proteins detected). Approximately 60 proteins occur in chromatin, nucleoplasm, and cytoplasm; one of these appears to be actin."
https://openalex.org/W1591411950,"Prostaglandins E2 and F2alpha are present in the culture medium of methylcholanthrene-transformed mouse BALB/3T3 cells. The production of these prostaglandins is stimulated when the cells are incubated in the presence of serum, arachidonic acid, thrombin, and bradykinin, or if they are mechanically manipulated. Whereas the appearance of prostaglandins resulting from the latter four treatments is complete in several minutes, in the presence of serum the prostaglandin levels are still increasing ever after 2 hours. Stimulation by all of these treatments is additive. Indomethacin inhibits these stimulations, suggesting that the production of prostaglandins results from de novo biosynthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1549027440,"Cells isolated from the livers of 17- to 19-day-old chick embryos were maintained in a chemically defined culture medium. During 3 days in culture the activity of malic enzyme, a measure of its concentration, was stimulated 2-, 23-, or 77-fold by insulin, triiodothyronine, or insulin plus triiodothyronine, respectively. Glucagon blocked the stimulation caused by insulin plus triiodothyronine. Changes in the relative synthesis of immunologically isolated malic enzyme were similar in magnitude and direction to the changes in enzyme activity. Degradation of malic enzyme was unaffected by the three hormones. Both soluble protein and malic enzyme were degraded with a t1/2 of about 30 hours. In cells preincubated for 2 days with insulin, synthesis of malic enzyme was stimulated 4.5-fold within 3 hours after adding triiodothyronine and reached an apparent new steady state after 24 to 30 hours. If the rate of enzyme synthesis was dependent on the concentration of cytoplasmic malic enzyme messenger RNA, then this messenger RNA appeared to have a t1/2 of about 18 hours. Glucagon rapidly and specifically inhibited synthesis of malic enzyme in preinduced cells, suggesting an action at the level of translation or cytoplasmic messenger RNA processing."

https://openalex.org/W1554539684,"Murine type C virus structural proteins, the envelope glycopeptides, 30,000 dalton major core protein, and 15,000 dalton internal protein have each been purified to near homogeneity and in high yield from the smae batch of virus by use of phosphocellulose column chromatography and gel filtration procedures. Evidence that these proteins are specified by the viral genome was obtained by competition radioimmunoassay analysis, comparing these polypeptides from Rauscher virus cultivated in a variety of mammalian cell lines; all of the reactive antigenic determinants of these proteins appeared to be virus-specific."
https://openalex.org/W1543206841,"The purification of hepatic delta-aminolevulinic acid synthase (EC 2.3.1.37) was accomplished from chick embryo liver mitochondria, which had been treated with the combination of drugs, 2-allylisopropylacetamide and 1,4-dihydro-3,5-dicarbethoxycollidine to produce a high starting level of enzyme activity. After extraction from the mitochondria by sonication, the enzyme was purified to a final specific activity of over 10,000 nmol of aminolevulinate formed/30 min/mg of protein/37 degrees, using the techniques of Sephadex chromatography, ammonium sulfate fractionation, affinity chromatography for pyridoxal phosphate, and preparative isoelectric focusing. An isoelectric point of 7.0 and a molecular weight of 87,000 were obtained for the native enzyme. The subunit molecular weight of 49,000, obtained by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, suggested it was a dimer. The enzyme was inhibited by p-chloromercuribenzoate and N-ethylmaleimide, stimulated by cations and exhibited an ultraviolet absorption spectrum characteristic of pyridoxal 5'-phosphate enzymes with absorption maxima at 325 and 420 nm."
https://openalex.org/W1541118450,"Bovine pancreatic trypsin was coupled to dextran after activation of the polysaccharide by cyanogen bromide. The soluble dextran-trypsin conjugated was purified by molecular sieve chromatography. After coupling, 53% of the esterase activity of trypsin remained, but the conjugate had only 7% of the caseinolytic activity of the native enzyme. The modified trypsin showed greater resistance than the native enzyme to inactivation by heat treatment, autodigestion, or denaturing agents, and was also more resistant to inhibition by trypsin inhibitors, particularly ovomucoid. Treatment with dextranase partly removed the improved stability properties and resistance to inhibition of the trypsin-dextran conjugate. The conjugated enzyme preparation consists of a heterogenous mixture of macromolecular aggregates, each containing many trypsin and many dextran molecules linked together. Intramolecular cross-linking of enzyme molecules by polysaccharide chains is considered to be responsible for stabilization of the tertiary structure of the enzyme molecules in the conjugate."

https://openalex.org/W1991006177,"Three electronically coupled motor neurons, which mediate inking behavior in Aplysia californica, receive both increased and decreased conductance excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSP's). The increased conductance EPSP's reduce electrical coupling among the cells, whereas the decreased conductance EPSP's increase electrical coupling. The decreased conductance EPSP's also augment the action of a previously ineffective sensory input and this augmentation is enhanced by the increase in electrical coupling. Both effects combine to trigger a stereotypic behavioral response."
https://openalex.org/W1500855389,"Seventeen distances from two paramagnetic reference points, as determined by nuclear relaxation studies of six active complexes of rabbit muscle pyruvate kinase, have been used to construct molecular models of two composite enzyme complexes. In the model of the hypothetical pyruvate kinase-M(I)-M(II)-ATP-Cr(III)-P-enolpyruvate complex, overlap of the transferred phosphoryl groups of the two substrates, which is required to explain the observed competition, is incomplete, allowing greater than or equal to 1 A for the transition state to form. In the active enzyme-M(I)-M(II)-ATP-Cr(III)-pyruvate complex, the gamma-phosphoryl phosphorus of ATP is in molecular contact (3.0 +/- 0.5 A) with the carbonyl oxygen of pyruvate, consistent with direct phosphoryl transfer, indicating no need for intermediate phosphorylation of the enzyme. The enzyme-bound divalent cation, which forms second sphere complexes with the phosphoryl groups of P-enolpyruvate and ATP, may activate the transferred phosphoryl group indirectly, through a water ligand. By analogy with the position of Cr(III), a second divalent cation may participate more directly by coordination of the triphosphate chain of ATP."
https://openalex.org/W1990887229,"Behavioral deficits in adult rats exposed perinatally to thiouracil were substantially reduced or elimated by a 5-week period of ""superenriched"" postweaning rearing conditions before testing. This treatment resulted in remediation of hypothyroid rats' deficits in maze learning, maze retention, and resistance to extinction of bar-pressing; the facilitative effect persisted for more than 4 months. These behavioral results were consistent with neurohistological findings from studies of early thyroid deficiency and postweaning environmental stimulation in rats."

https://openalex.org/W1564485200,"The lipids of the whole flagella and the flagella membrane of the phytoflagellate Ochromonas danica were isolated and compared with those of the whole cell. The polar lipids were separated by two-dimensional thin layer chromatography. One-dimensional thin layer chromatography was used for the separation of the nonpolar lipids. In all respects the lipids of the whole flagella were identical with those of the flagellar membrane. These methods established the presence in flagellar membrane of the polychlorosulfolipids of O. danica as more than 90 molar per cent of the total polar lipids. These sulfolipids had been previously characterized as 1,14-docosanediol-1, 14-disulfate and 1,15-tetracosanediol-1,15-disulfate, containing zero to six chloro groups substituting for hydrogen on the chain. Seven unknown polar lipids were found. Both phosphorus analysis on each lipid and the molybdenum spray reagent for phospholipids on the chromatogram showed that there is no phospholipid present in O. danica flagellar membrane. Positive reactions to the diphenylamine spray reagent suggest that up to four of the unknown polar lipids are glycolipids. Of these, three reacted positively with ninhydrin. All of the unknown lipids reacted with the acidified 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine spray reagent suggesting the presence of aldehyde, ketone, glycoside, or plasmalogen. One unknown substance appeared near the origin of thin layer chromatograms. It showed a positive reaction with Dragendorff reagent, suggesting the presence of a quaternary amine group. This substance is presumed to be nonlipid, since it is not synthesized from [1-14C]acetate under the growth conditions used, as revealed by autoradiograms of thin layer chromatograms. It contained 35% hexose or hexosamine. It is devoid of phosphorus (0.7%) and is less than 4% protein (or phenolic groups or peptide), as judged by the Lowry assay using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Analysis of the nonpolar lipids of the flagellar membrane showed that free fatty acids constitute about 12 molar per cent of the total lipids. These fatty acids could be true components of the membrane or artifacts of the extraction procedure although every precaution was taken to prevent artifactual production of free fatty acids. The sterols constitute nearly 10 molar per cent of total lipids. Sterol esters were absent from the membrane. There are two additional major unknown nonpolar lipids present. The implications of such a high proportion of chlorosulfolipids as a polar lipid component in the membrane are important because of the unique structures of these lipids, which have ionic groups at or near both ends of the aliphatic chain."

https://openalex.org/W1550029773,"The glycogen phosphorylase of Dictyostelium discoideum has been purified over 200-fold from cells in the culmination stage of development. Analytical gel electrophoresis of the purified enzyme indicates one major protein band with a molecular weight of approximately 210,000. Gel elution verified the presence of phosphorylase activity associated with the protein band. Electrophoresis of partially purified extracts prepared from amoebae cells revealed the absence of phosphorylase protein. Sodium dodecyl sulfate electrophoresis on 6% gels indicated that the purified phosphorylase is composed of subunits, 95,000 in molecular weight. The purified enzyme exhibited normal Michaelis-Menten kinetics and activity was not stimulated by added nucleotides such as 5'-AMP. Nucleotide sugars (GDP-glucose, UDP-glucose, ADP-glucose) were competitive inhibitors of the phosphorylase reaction."
https://openalex.org/W1602458935,"Abstract A purified preparation of glycogen phosphorylase from Dictyostelium discoideum was used to elicit specific antisera in rabbits. The antisera were used to quantitate the amount of precipitable phosphorylase protein from cell extracts prepared at various stages of the developmental cycle. Following isotope incorporation studies in differentiating cells, the specific radioactivity of enzyme isolated by antibody precipitation was compared to that of acid-insoluble protein. Prior to 5 hours of development, glycogen phosphorylase could not be detected enzymatically or immunologically. Between aggregation and culmination, the rate of enzyme synthesis increased about 6-fold, then decreased to an insignificant value in young sorocarps. The rate of enzyme degradation was negligible during the period of maximal enzyme accumulation, then increased to a peak value of 40% after culmination, coincident with a rapid drop in phosphorylase activity. The data indicated that the increase in glycogen phosphorylase activity during development results from an increase in the rate of enzyme synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W2056367131,"Hybrid somatic cells containing a partial complement of human chromosomes were used to demonstrate that the human alpha- and beta-globin genes are located on different chromosomes. Two cell lines consisting of a cross of mouse with human fibroblasts contained the human alpha- and not the beta-globin gene, while a cross of human marrow cells with mouse erythroleukemia cells expressed the human beta- but not the alpha-globin gene."
https://openalex.org/W1555710727,"The isolation and purification of the flagellar membrane of the phytoflagellate, Ochromonas danica, is described. The procedure is simple, mild, rapid, and it produces a pure membrane preparation. The method additionally permits the isolation of clean preparations of axonemes and mastigonemes from a single flagella preparation. Each component was studied by electron microscopy and acrylamide gel electrophroesis. The isolated flagella preparation was nearly free of other cellular organelles as judged by phase contrast and electron microscopy. The purified membrane preparation consisted of small vesicles (500 to 1500 A in diameter) with a trilamellar pattern about 80 A thick. Isolated membrane was analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, displaying five major protein bands, five minor protein bands, and some protein which remained at the origin. The five major protein components had apparent molecular weights of 54,000, 47,000, 35,000, 31,000, and 28,000. All mastigoneme protein components are glycoproteins as judged by periodic acid-Schiff staining. The mastigoneme preparation contained three major protein bands. Two of them were revealed as doublets and migrated with an average velocity corresponding to 83,000 delatons, the other major protein band migrated with a velocity corresponding to 54,000 daltons. A heavy carbohydrate band is seen near the bromphenol blue tracking dye. The axoneme preparation showed one major protein band having an apparent molecular weight of about 54,000 and some proteins having high molecular weights which remained on top of the polyacrylamide gel."

https://openalex.org/W1487658384,"The subcellular distribution of receptors for nerve growth factor (NGF), as assayed by specific binding of the 125I-labeled protein, during the embryonic development of chick brain has been examined. Utilizing differential centrifugation and discontinuous sucrose density gradient centrifugation, it was observed that the majority of the specific NGF receptors are localized in the crude (P2) and purified (B) synaptosomal fractions at all stages of brain development examined. However, during early stages (day 6 to 8) a significant portion of the receptors are also found in the P1 fraction, consistent with their location on dense subcellular structures. Significant 125I-NGF binding is observed in this period of development before the appearance of neurochemical markers (choline acetyltransferase, dopamine-beta-hydroxylase, and 125I-alpha-bungarotoxin binding) which are associated with synaptosomes. The latter stages of development, particularly days 13 to 18, show parallel rapid increases in all neurochemical markers and 125I-NGF binding consistent with the association of nearly all late appearing NGF receptors with synaptosomes. These two apparent classes of NGF receptors may have distinct functional roles in the embryonic development of the chick brain."

https://openalex.org/W1547292716,"Cytosol retinol (vitamin A)-binding lipoglycoproteins were isolated from preparations of bovine retinal pigment epithelial cells and from rod photoreceptor outer segment fractions. The lipoglycoproteins had molecular weights of at least 1.5 X 10(6) as determined by gel filtration chromatography. The purified lipoglycoprotein which was obtained from pigment epithelial cells contains at least two kinds of polypeptide subunits (molecular weight about 35,000 and 150,000), while the rod outer segment cytosol lipoglycoprotein contains at least four kinds of polypeptide subunits (molecular weight about 50,000, 75,000, 120,000, and, 200,000). The pigment epithelial cytosol retinol-binding material contains about 30% (by weight) of lipid, while the material obtained from rod photoreceptor outer segment fractions contains about 65% (by weight) of lipid. Both lipoproteins contain predominantly cholesterol and phosphatidylcholine, while cholesterol esters, triglycerides, phosphatidylethanolamine, and phosphatidylserine are absent. The amino acid compositions of the delipidated proteins from pigment epithelial cells and rod outer segment fractions are similar. The neutral and amino sugars are co-valently linked to the polypeptide moiety of the molecule. The absorption and circular dichroism spectra of the lipoproteins obtained from pigment epithelial cells and rod outer segment fractions are different."
https://openalex.org/W1556568807,"Experiments with the Neurospora crassa single strand-specific endonuclease have provided evidence for the existence of regions of partially single-stranded character in covalently closed superhelical replicative form DNA of phiX174. The nuclease converts the superhelical molecules to either singly hit relaxed circular or doubly hit linear molecules. We show that the initial cleavage of phiX174 superhelical DNA is a bounded by a 5'-phosphate and a 3'-hydroxyl; no nucleotides are excised as evidenced by the ability of T4-polynucleotide ligase to reform the phosphodiester bond. The nick can be found in either strand of the double-stranded DNA and is either randomly distributed or at least can be found at any one of many possible locations in the genome. Thus, the regions in phiX174 superhelical molecules that are sensitive to the N. crassa nuclease do not occur at highly specific sites in the genome."

The purified protein binds both oxytocin and lysine vasopressin. Gel filtration on a calibrated column of Sephadex G-75 gives an estimate of the molecular weight of 10,000. Amino acid analyses establish the composition Lyla8, 1/2Cys14, Val2, Met1, Ile2, Leu7, Tyr1, Phe3. The total number of amino acid residues is 95. This composition exceeds that of porcine neurophysin-I by 1 alanine and 2 arginine residues. It has an NH2-terminal alanine and the COOH-terminal sequence- Arg-Arg-Ala. Results of peptide maps, the amino acid composition of tryptic peptides, and the sequences of two small tryptic peptides suggest that porcine neurophysin III contains the entire molecule of porcine neurophysin I plus a tripeptide -Arg-Arg-Ala connected the COOH terminus. It is threfore possible that porcine neurophysin I may have been derived from porcine neurophysin III by the proteolytic removal of the last 3 or 4 amino acid residues from the COOH terminus, and that the porcine hypothalamic tissue synthesizes only two neurophysins, II and III."

https://openalex.org/W2023863042,"WHEN their food supply is exhausted, single amoebae of the cellular slime mould Dictyostelium discoideum aggregate1. On a two-dimensional substrate such as agar, this aggregation is the result of a succession of periodic coordinated movement steps directed towards a group of amoebae—the “centre”, which may in fact lie anywhere in the field of cells. Recent theoretical2,3 and experimental4–7 work suggests that this process can be explained as follows. (1) The centre produces and releases cyclic AMP (the signal) in an oscillatory manner, and (2) other cells in the field respond chemotactically by moving up cyclic AMP gradients and relay the signal progressively outwards. By means of time-lapse cinematography we have looked at the oscillation frequency v during the aggregation of small drops (about 1,000 cells in a drop of diameter 1 mm) of D. discoideum cells (strain NC-4H) aggregating on hydrophobia agar8 at various temperatures, and have found that the oscillation frequency increases with temperature (Fig. 1)."
