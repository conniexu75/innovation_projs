https://openalex.org/W2029675195,"The epidermis is believed to contain two types of proliferating cells: stem cells and cells with a lower capacity for self-renewal and higher probability of undergoing terminal differentiation (transit amplifying cells). We report that keratinocytes with characteristics of stem cells can be isolated from cultured human epidermis on the basis of high surface expression of beta 1 integrins and rapid adhesion to extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins. Among keratinocytes there was a log linear relationship between the relative level of beta 1 integrins on the cell surface and proliferative capacity; furthermore, the cells with the highest colony-forming efficiency adhered most rapidly to type IV collagen, fibronectin, or keratinocyte ECM. Proliferating keratinocytes that adhered more slowly had characteristics of transit amplifying cells: after one to five rounds of division, all of their daughters underwent terminal differentiation. Since stem cells can be isolated to greater than 90% purity on the basis of their adhesive properties, it will now be possible to investigate the mechanisms that regulate the fate of their progeny."
https://openalex.org/W2081978633,"Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria is an acquired hematopoietic disease characterized by abnormal blood cell populations in which the biosynthesis of the glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor is deficient. Deficiency of surface expressions of GPI-anchored complement inhibitors leads to complement-mediated hemolysis. Here we report that PIG-A, which participates in the early step of GPI anchor biosynthesis, is the gene responsible for paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria. Affected granulocytes and B lymphocytes had the same somatic mutation of PIG-A, indicating their clonal origin from a multipotential hematopoietic stem cell. We localized PIG-A to the X chromosome, which accounts for expression of the recessive phenotype of the somatic mutation and the fact that the same one of the multiple biosynthetic steps is affected in all patients so far characterized."
https://openalex.org/W2010622646,"Influenza hemagglutinin (HA) undergoes a conformational change that induces viral fusion with the cellular membrane. The structure of HA in the fusogenic state is unknown. We have identified a sequence in HA that has a high propensity for forming a coiled coil. Surprisingly, this sequence corresponds to a loop region in the X-ray structure of native HA: the loop is followed by a three-stranded, coiled-coil stem. We find that a 36 residue peptide (LOOP-36), comprising the loop region and the first part of the stem, forms a three-stranded coiled coil. This coiled coil is extended and stabilized in a longer peptide, corresponding to LOOP-36 plus the residues of a preceding, short alpha helix. These findings lead to a model for the fusogenic conformation of HA: the coiled-coil stem of the native state extends, relocating the hydrophobic fusion peptide, by 100 A, toward the target membrane."

https://openalex.org/W2005381157,"With the aim of identifying novel regulators of adipocyte differentiation, we have cloned and characterized preadipocyte factor 1 (pref-1), a novel member of the epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like family of proteins. Pref-1 is synthesized as a transmembrane protein with six tandem EGF-like repeats. In preadipocytes, multiple discrete forms of pref-1 protein of 45-60 kd are present, owing in part to N-linked glycosylation. While pref-1 mRNA is abundant in preadipocytes, its expression is completely abolished during differentiation of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes to adipocytes. Moreover, constitutive expression of pref-1 in preadipocytes, which in effect blocks its down-regulation, drastically inhibits adipose differentiation. This indicates that pref-1 functions as a negative regulator of adipocyte differentiation, possibly in a manner analogous to EGF-like proteins that govern cell fate decisions in invertebrates."

https://openalex.org/W2049859215,"The identity of cell types generated along the dorsoventral axis of the neural tube depends on inductive signals that derive from both mesodermal and neural cells. To define the nature of these signals, we have analyzed the differentiation of cells in neural plate explants. Motor neurons and neural crest cells differentiate in vitro from appropriate regions of the neural plate, indicating that the specification of cell fate along the dorsoventral axis of the neural tube begins at the neural plate stage. Motor neuron differentiation can be induced by a diffusible factor that derives initially from the notochord and later from floor plate cells. By contrast, floor plate induction requires contact with the notochord. Thus, the identity and patterning of neural cell types appear to involve distinct contact-mediated and diffusible signals from the notochord and floor plate."

https://openalex.org/W2163597027,"The small GTP-binding protein, ADP-ribosylation factor (ARF), has previously been shown to mediate the binding to Golgi membranes of the coatomer of non-cathrin-coated (COP-coated) vesicles. We now report that ARF is also required for the binding of the AP-1 adaptor protein of clathrin-coated vesicles to Golgi membranes. The binding of coat proteins from both clathrin- and COP-coated vesicles requires an additional Golgi membrane-associated factor. These results suggest that a mechanistic similarity underlies diverse types of vesicle coats."

https://openalex.org/W2077881308,"Xotch is a Xenopus homolog of Notch, a receptor involved in cell fate decisions in Drosophila. Using an extracellular deletion construct, Xotch delta E, we show that Xotch has a similar role in Xenopus embryos. Broad expression causes the loss of dorsal structures and the expansion and disorganization of the brain. Single blastomere injections of Xotch delta E induce autonomous neural and mesodermal hypertrophy, even in the absence of cell division. Xotch delta E inhibits the early expression of epidermal and neural crest markers yet enhances and extends the response of animal caps to mesodermal and neural induction. Our data suggest a mechanism for the function of Notch homologs in which they delay differentiation and leave undetermined cells competent to respond to later inductive signals."

https://openalex.org/W2057831214,"Mice deficient in the gene encoding the peptide transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP1) have drastically reduced levels of surface expression of MHC class I molecules and few CD8+ T cells. Addition of class I binding peptides to cultured fetal thymi from TAP1 mutant mice invariably allowed the rescue of class I expression, while only some of these peptides promoted the positive selection of CD8+ T cells, which were polyclonal and specific for the peptide-MHC complex. A nonselecting peptide was converted to a mixture of selecting peptides when the residues involved in the interaction with TCRs were altered. A mixture of self-peptides derived from C57BL/6 thymi induced positive selection of CD8+ T cells at concentrations that gave relatively low class I surface expression. The implication of these observations is that self-peptides determine, in part, the repertoire of specificities exhibited by CD8+ T cells."

https://openalex.org/W2072962648,"Cauliflower mosaic virus 35S RNA contains a 600 nt leader with several small open reading frames that by themselves inhibit translation of downstream coding regions. In the context of the whole leader and in certain plant cells, however, translation of downstream coding regions is allowed. This translation is dependent on the RNA 5' terminus and other elements of the leader. However, its central portion is dispensable or can be modified by insertion of an energy-rich stem-loop structure or long coding region with many internal AUG codons. We conclude that this region can be by-passed (shunted) by the scanning complex. Shunting was also observed in trans between two separate RNA molecules."
https://openalex.org/W2003756298,"We have designed and utilized two in vivo assays of kinetochore integrity in S. cerevisiae. One assay detects relaxation of a transcription block formed at centromeres; the other detects an increase in the mitotic stability of a dicentric test chromosome. ctf13-30 and ctf14-42 were identified as putative kinetochore mutants by both assays. CTF14 is identical to NDC10/CBF2, a recently identified essential gene that encodes a 110 kd kinetochore component. CTF13 is an essential gene that encodes a predicted 478 amino acid protein with no homology to known proteins. ctf13 mutants missegregate chromosomes at permissive temperature and transiently arrest at nonpermissive temperature as large-budded cells with a G2 DNA content and a short spindle. Antibodies recognizing epitope-tagged CTF13 protein decrease the electrophoretic mobility of a CEN DNA-protein complex formed in vitro. Together, the genetic and biochemical data indicate that CTF13 is an essential kinetochore protein."

https://openalex.org/W2076021340,"The role of the lumenal contents (reticuloplasm) of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in protein translocation was determined by in vitro analysis. Depletion of the reticuloplasm from mammalian rough microsomes revealed two distinct stages of the translocation reaction. The first stage, translocation up to and including signal peptide cleavage, was insensitive to the loss of the reticuloplasm, whereas the second stage, net transfer of the nascent chain into the ER lumen, was reticuloplasm dependent. In reticuloplasm-depleted membranes, signal-cleaved and glycosylated translocation intermediates were observed to transit free from the translocation channel to the cis, or cytoplasmic, side of the membrane. This translocation defect was complemented by reconstitution of lumenal proteins into depleted membranes. We propose that lumenal proteins are necessary for unidirectional protein translocation in mammalian ER."

https://openalex.org/W1981936717,"Rat liver interphase chromosomes have telomeres 20–100 kb in length. Micrococcal nuclease digestion of nuclei cleaves telomeres with a uniform 157 bp periodicity, producing soluble particles that sediment in sucrose gradients exactly like oligonucleosomes. The monomeric telomere particles comigrate with nucleosome core particles on nucleoprotein and DNA gels but do not bind H1. DNAase I cleaves telomere nucleoprotein into a series of bands spaced by about 10.4 bp and with the same intensity distribution as bands from bulk nucleosomes. Removal of H1 from chromatin alters the sedimentation properties of telomeres in parallel with bulk chromatin. Thus, telomeres of mammals are constructed of closely spaced nucleosomes, in contrast with the telomeres of lower eukaryotes, which show no evidence of nucleosomal structure."
https://openalex.org/W1982483908,"The establishment of dorsal-ventral asymmetry of the Drosophila embryo requires a group of genes that act maternally. None of the previously identified dorsal-ventral axis genes are known to produce asymmetrically localized gene products during oogenesis. We show that rhomboid (rho), a novel member of this group, encodes a protein that is localized on the apical surface of the dorsal-anterior follicle cells surrounding the oocyte. Loss of rho function causes ventralization of the eggshell and the embryo, whereas ectopic expression leads to dorsalization of both structures. Thus, spatially restricted rho is necessary and sufficient for dorsal-ventral axis formation. We propose, based on these observations and double mutant experiments, that the spatially restricted rho protein leads to selective activation of the epidermal growth factor receptor in the dorsal follicle cells and subsequently the specification of the dorsal follicle cells."
https://openalex.org/W1489436358,"After intravenous injection, DNA complexed with asialoglycoprotein-polylysine conjugates is endocytosed by hepatocytes via asialoglycoprotein receptors and is expressed transiently. Long term persistence and expression occurs when partial hepatectomy is performed after gene delivery. To determine the intracellular location of the persisting DNA, we transferred a plasmid expressing bacterial chloramphenicol acetyltransferase into the liver of rats in vivo by asialoglycoprotein receptor-mediated endocytosis. The internalized DNA was measured by Southern blot. Twenty min after administration, 80-85% of the plasmid appeared in the liver, 80% of which was within hepatocytes (12,000-18,000 copies/hepatocyte). In sham-operated control rats, the transgene concentration decreased to 8-12 and 2-4% of the initial levels in 4 and 24 h, respectively, and became undetectable at 7 days. In rats subjected to 66% hepatectomy 20 min after DNA administration, 20, 9, and 7% of the plasmid in the residual liver persisted at 4 h, 24 h, and 7 days, respectively. Liver homogenates were fractionated by differential centrifugation and Percoll gradient centrifugation. In 66% hepatectomized rats, the plasmid persisted in an undegraded, transfection-competent form in plasma membrane/endosome-enriched fractions throughout the duration of the experiment (7 days), indicating that cytoplasmic vesicles are the main site of persistence of the endocytosed DNA."

https://openalex.org/W1497140289,"Abstract The polypyrimidine (py) tract of introns is required for efficient spliceosome assembly and splicing of pre-mRNAs. A detailed mutational analysis of the py tract of an adenovirus 2 intron was carried out. Utilizing a precursor in pieces vector system, it was possible to synthesize py tract mutant pre-mRNAs that were otherwise identical. The mutant pre-mRNAs that were otherwise identical. The mutant pre-mRNAs were analyzed for in vitro splicing, for formation of splicing complexes, and for binding to proteins in the HeLa nuclear extract. Chimeric pre-mRNAs that contained the yeast branch point consensus sequence (UAC-UAAC) and altered py tracts were also analyzed. Mutational analysis showed the following. First, any mutation in the py tract that affected splicing did so by interferring with complex A formation in spliceosome assembly. Second, introduction of purines into the py tract is detrimental only if the length of the tract is shortened and if there is a reduction in the number of consecutive uracil residues. Third, uracil and cytosine do not have equivalent functions in the py tract. Our results with chimeric pre-mRNAs also show that a strong py tract can partially replace a weak branch point sequence and a strong branch point sequence can partially replace a weak py tract. Finally, the one surprising finding obtained when examining protein binding was that a mutant pre-mRNA did not bind to heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein C proteins and yet spliced close to wild type level."
https://openalex.org/W2004359271,"BOS1 encodes an integral endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane protein and genetically interacts with three other yeast genes (BET1, SEC22, and YPT1) whose products are required for membrane traffic between the ER and the Golgi apparatus. Using an assay that reconstitutes transport at this stage of the pathway, we find that anti-Bos1p antibody blocks protein export after vesicles bud from the ER but prior to fusion with the Golgi. Additionally, the depletion of Bos1p from the ER leads to the formation of transport-incompetent vesicles. Carrier vesicles, immunoisolated with anti-Bos1p antibody, are approximately 50 nm in size. These vesicles contain Bos1p, Sec22p, and Ypt1p, but not Bet1p. The functional interactions of Bos1p with Ypt1p and Sec22p may be necessary for the fusion competence of the ER to Golgi transport vesicles."

https://openalex.org/W1504327072,"Insulin-stimulated autophosphorylation of the cytoplasmic juxtamembrane region of the human insulin receptor was examined by Tricine/SDS-PAGE. Various mutant receptor molecules were used to identify two tryptic phosphopeptides associated with the juxtamembrane region which accounts for 15% of the autophosphorylation of partially purified insulin receptor. These phosphopeptides were immunoprecipitated with an antipeptide antibody against the juxtamembrane sequence and were phosphorylated exclusively on tyrosine. Substitution of both Tyr960 and Tyr953 with alanine eliminated insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of the juxtamembrane region without affecting tyrosine autophosphorylation in the C terminus or regulatory regions. Monosubstitution of Tyr960 with phenylalanine or alanine reduced phosphorylation in the juxtamembrane region by more than 50%, and manual Edman degradation indicated that Tyr960 was phosphorylated in wild-type receptor. In vivo, phosphorylation of the juxtamembrane region accounts for one-third of the insulin receptor phosphorylation and contains both phosphoserine and phosphotyrosine. Deletion of Tyr960 and 11 adjacent amino acids eliminated insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of the juxtamembrane region. Substitution of Tyr960 reduced this phosphorylation by more than 50%. The insulin receptor also undergoes serine phosphorylation outside of the juxtamembrane region which depends on the presence of Tyr1151. Together with our previous studies, this report suggests that phosphorylation of Tyr960 may play an important role in signal transduction by the insulin receptor."

The mutation disrupts specific synapses of the giant fibers (GFs), command neurons for this response. Pas was cloned from a P element-induced allele. The cDNA encodes a putative membrane protein of 361 amino acids. Null, hypomorphic, and dominant alleles were sequenced. In the adult central nervous system, and in the pupa during GF synapse formation, Pas is consistently expressed in the GF and in a large thoracic cell in the location of its postsynaptic targets. Pas establishes a new gene family. The Drosophila ogre protein, required for postembryonic neuroblast development, is 47% identical; the C. elegans Unc-7 protein, which when mutated alters the connectivity of a few neurons, is 33% identical."
https://openalex.org/W1606302035,"Human surfactant protein B (SPB) is a 79-amino-acid hydrophobic protein that enhances the surface active properties of pulmonary surfactant. SPB is expressed in nonciliated bronchiolar and alveolar type II cells of the respiratory epithelium, and its expression increases markedly late in gestation. In the present study, a human pulmonary adenocarcinoma cell line, H441, was used in both functional and biochemical assays to identify DNA sequences controlling lung cell-specific expression of the SPB gene. DNase I hypersensitive studies demonstrated two distinct regions of lung cell-specific hypersensitivity located proximal to the SPB promoter and within the eighth intron of the gene. To functionally define these DNA sequences, a series of plasmid vectors were constructed in which segments of the human SPB gene and 5'-flanking sequence were linked to a CAT reporter gene and assayed for expression in lung and nonlung cell lines. Whereas far upstream and intronic sequences did not contain enhancer-like elements, a 259-base pair DNA segment (base pair -218 to +41) was sufficient to support lung cell-specific expression. DNase I footprinting demonstrated that this pulmonary epithelial cell-specific promoter fragment contained five nuclear protein-binding sites, two of which bound lung cell-specific nuclear protein complexes. These results suggest that the pulmonary epithelial cell-specific expression of SPB is determined, in part, by both ubiquitous and cell type-specific protein-DNA interactions within the proximal promoter region."

https://openalex.org/W1546193803,"There are two types of intercalated cells of the renal collecting duct; one secretes H+ and the other secretes HCO3-. The H(+)-secreting form has an apical vacuolar H(+)-ATPase and a basolateral Cl/HCO3 exchanger that cross-reacts with antibodies to band 3, the product of the AE1 gene. The HCO3(-)-secreting form has a basolateral vacuolar H(+)-ATPase and an apical Cl/HCO3 exchanger, whose identity has not been established previously. Apical membrane vesicles of beta intercalated cells purified from rabbit kidney cortex contain both an electroneutral Cl/HCO3 exchange activity and polypeptides that react with antibodies to band 3 on Western blots. Furthermore, both primary cultures of HCO3(-)-secreting intercalated cells and an immortalized cell line derived from these cells express AE1 and have an apical Cl/HCO3 exchanger. Apical membranes purified from these cells contain a 100-kDa polypeptide that cross-reacts with antibody to the cytoplasmic domain of band 3. These data suggest that the apical Cl/HCO3 exchanger of HCO3(-)-secreting intercalated cells is band 3."
https://openalex.org/W1858064878,"Mutant and chimeric lipoxygenases were expressed in human embryonal kidney 293 cells to assess the importance of amino acids and domains for catalytic activity and positional specificity of molecular oxygen insertion. Histidines 360, 365, and 540, when changed to glutamine residues, completely abolished human platelet 12-lipoxygenase activity. Altered histidines at positions 355, 383, and 392 retained enzymatic activity. The former three histidines could possibly serve as ligands for the catalytically essential non-heme iron atom. Amino acids adjacent (residues 398-417) to the five centrally located histidines conserved among all plant and animal lipoxygenases controlled to a limited extent the positional specificity of oxygenation of 12-lipoxygenase. Variant A417I and the triple variant K416Q/A417I/V418M, designed to introduce 15-lipoxygenase substitutions, transformed the platelet 12-lipoxygenase that synthesizes exclusively 12-hydro(pero)xy-eicosatetraenoic acid (12-H(P)ETE) to an enzyme capable of 10-20% 15-lipoxygenation. When all amino acids between positions 398-429 of 12-lipoxygenase had the corresponding 15-lipoxygenase sequence, the enzyme made 66% 15-lipoxygenase products. The latter enzyme had markedly reduced enzyme activity, though, indicating an apparent shift in the optimal alignment of substrate at the active site for hydrogen atom abstraction. The platelet enzyme could not be altered to form 5-lipoxygenase products by similar manipulations of sequence within this region. Chimeric enzymes consisting of an NH2-terminal segment from one lipoxygenase and the COOH terminus from another lipoxygenase or large substitutions resulted in nonfunctional enzymes. NH2-terminal extensions, but not short deletions, could be tolerated functionally. These studies provide some new insights into lipoxygenase structure-function in the absence of an unresolved three-dimensional structure."

https://openalex.org/W1526891614,"Syndecan-1, the prototype of a family of heparan sulfate-containing integral membrane proteoglycans, associates extracellularly with a variety of matrix molecules and growth factors and intracellularly with the actin cytoskeleton. Expressed constitutively on epithelia in mature tissues and in a developmentally regulated manner on epithelial and induced mesenchymal cells during embryogenesis, syndecan-1 appears to be involved in controlling the shape and organization of cells and tissues. To better understand the function and regulation of syndecan-1, we determined the structure of the mouse syndecan-1 gene (Synd-1). Synd-1 is approximately 19.5 kilobases in size and is organized into five exons that appear conserved in other family members. Exon 1 encodes the signal peptide; exon 2, the N-terminal glycosaminoglycan attachment region; exon 3, the bulk of the extracellular domain; exon 4, the protease-susceptible site; and exon 5, the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains which are highly homologous between syndecan family members. Synd-1 has three transcriptional start sites, two polyadenylation sites, and is not alternatively spliced to produce its 2.6- and 3.4-kilobase mRNA species. Upstream sequences have promoter activity and contain TATA and CAAT boxes as well as a variety of other potential binding sites for transcription factors, including Sp1 (GC box), NF-kappa B, MyoD (E box), and Antennapedia. The structure of the promoter region suggests that control of Synd-1 expression is both constitutive and developmentally regulated. Because Synd-1 exons encode discrete functional domains of the syndecan-1 protein that are conserved throughout the syndecan family, all syndecan genes are likely derived from a common ancestor."
https://openalex.org/W1975014999,"The conserved nucleotides 9 and 10 of U1 small nuclear RNA (snRNA) have been proposed to base pair with either 5' exon or 3' splice site sequences. In S. pombe, U1 snRNA pairing with the conserved 3' splice site is required for the first step of splicing and viability. In contrast, we show that S. cerevisiae U1 mutants at positions 9 and 10 are fully functional. Splicing of several genes is normal in these strains, ruling out an essential base pairing between U1 snRNA and 3' splice sites. U1 snRNA positions 9 and 10 are shown to be involved in 5' splice site selection through their interaction with exon sequences. Our results demonstrate that some snRNA-pre-mRNA interactions are not evolutionarily conserved and that 3' splice site recognition occurs by different mechanisms in various organisms."
https://openalex.org/W1559116353,"Abstract We have identified and partially characterized a novel class III transcription factor fraction (TFIIIE) from yeast nuclear extracts. TFIIIE is functionally distinct from the standard yeast transcription factor fractions, TFIIIB and TFIIIC. It is also different from either of the TFIIIB subfractions, B' and B. TFIIIE is essential for specific transcription of both tRNA and 5 S RNA genes, its activity is sensitive to proteinase K, and it exhibits an apparent sedimentation coefficient of 4.0 S when analyzed on glycerol gradients. In the case of a tRNA gene, TFIIIE does not play a role in the formation of stable preinitiation complexes containing TFIIIB and TFIIIC. It is required for single as well as multiple rounds of transcription, however. Thus, TFIIIE is involved in the utilization of stable transcription complexes, but its action is not restricted to reinitiation events."
https://openalex.org/W1562915711,"Recently we partially purified from Xenopus laevis ovaries a novel, ATP-dependent, spacing activity that can convert a DNA template consisting of irregularly spaced nucleosomes into a chromatin structure made up of regularly spaced nucleosomes with a repeat length of 160-165 base pairs. In a second independent step, the longer spacing of higher eukaryotic chromatin can be generated by the addition of histone H1. The partially purified spacing fraction contains several proteins that display chromatographic properties and mobilities on polyacrylamide gels similar to high mobility group (HMG) proteins. For that reason, different HMG proteins were tested for their ability to generate chromatin structures with regularly spaced nucleosomes. In this report, using two different nucleosome assembly systems, we show that the addition of phosphorylated HMGs 14 and 17 to the histone octamer results in the formation of chromatin with a repeat length of 160-165 base pairs. The results are similar to those obtained from studies of chromatin structure in simple cells, such as fungi and yeast, and in active genes."
https://openalex.org/W1573505897,"The role of glycosylation in the synthesis, transport, and localization of procathepsin L has been analyzed. Procathepsin L is the precursor form of a lysosomal cysteine protease which is synthesized in large amounts by malignantly transformed cells and cells treated with growth factors or tumor promoters. As for other lysosomal hydrolases, procathepsin L is predominantly secreted when it is overexpressed, despite the presence of the lysosomal sorting marker mannose 6-phosphate. To study the role of glycosylation in procathepsin L trafficking, we constructed a cDNA in which the codon for Asn-204 was mutated to encode Gln. When this mutated cDNA was transfected into NIH 3T3 cells, a completely nonglycosylated form of procathepsin L was expressed. The protein appeared to be folded properly, as judged by its ability to be proteolytically processed to a lower molecular weight form during incubation at pH 4. Nonglycosylated protein was stable, both as unprocessed proenzyme and after processing at pH 4, and it was predominantly secreted instead of being delivered to lysosomes. Nonglycosylated and endogenous glycosylated procathepsin L were secreted by NIH 3T3 cells with identical kinetics. These studies therefore confirm that Asn-204 is the normal functional carbohydrate acceptor in procathepsin L and that carbohydrate in wild-type procathepsin L serves predominantly as a lysosomal targeting signal, with little or no role in protein folding or stability. Furthermore, there does not appear to be a major mannose 6-phosphate-independent route of lysosomal localization in NIH 3T3 cells. In experiments with a second mutant, the glycosylation signal at Asn-251, which normally is not utilized, was capable of serving as a carbohydrate acceptor, suggesting that there is normally a structural impediment to glycosylation at Asn-251 in procathepsin L."
https://openalex.org/W1615826216,"TFIIIA, a site-specific DNA-binding protein containing nine zinc finger motifs, is an RNA polymerase III transcription factor responsible for the assembly of a transcription complex on the 5 S RNA gene. We have analyzed the effect of deleting various regions of yeast TFIIIA on its ability to bind to the internal control region of the yeast 5 S RNA gene, to recruit TFIIIC into the TFIIIA.DNA complex and to promote in vitro transcription of the 5 S RNA gene. A truncated polypeptide containing only the three amino-terminal zinc fingers retained the ability to bind specifically to the internal control region of the 5 S RNA gene. The TFIIIA.DNA complex formed with this three zinc finger module was able to recruit TFIIIC but could not promote transcription. An 81-amino acid domain, which interrupts the repeating zinc finger motifs between fingers 8 and 9, was found to be essential for the transcription activity of the protein. Removal of the carboxyl-terminal region of yeast TFIIIA that extends beyond the ninth zinc finger motif had no effect on the in vitro activities of the protein. Extending the carboxyl-terminal deletion to include the ninth zinc finger led to reduced transcription activity. We speculate that the ninth zinc finger serves to anchor the carboxyl-terminal portion of TFIIIA on the 5 S RNA gene, correctly orienting the 81-amino acid domain to serve its role in promoting transcription. Removal of the region of the protein amino-terminal to the first zinc finger motif was without effect. Extending the amino-terminal deletion to include the first zinc finger appeared to decrease the affinity of TFIIIA for DNA without affecting the specificity of the protein-DNA interaction. The resultant TFIIIA.DNA complex was defective in recruiting TFIIIC and did not support transcription."
https://openalex.org/W1546714047,"Human fibrinogen is a dimer, and each half-molecule is composed of three different polypeptides (A alpha, B beta, and gamma). The two half-molecules are joined together at the amino-terminal ends by three symmetrical disulfide bonds between adjacent A alpha chains, at position 28, and between adjacent gamma chains at gamma 8 and 9. To determine the role of these disulfide bonds in fibrinogen assembly and secretion, site-directed mutagenesis was used to change cysteines of A alpha 28 and gamma 8 and 9 to serine, the mutant chains were coexpressed with normal fibrinogen chains in COS cells, and assembly and secretion of fibrinogen were measured. Elimination of the symmetrical disulfide bonds did not affect assembly of the chains and dimeric fibrinogen was secreted. Analysis by plasmin digestion indicated that the secreted mutant fibrinogens have a similar structure to normal fibrinogen. Our results indicate that other domains of fibrinogen participate in dimer formation and that the three symmetrical disulfide bonds are not crucial for assembly and secretion of fibrinogen."

Similarly, 24-norchenodeoxycholic acid (nor-CDCA) was 5 beta-hydroxylated to give 5 beta-hydroxynor-chenodeoxycholic acid 4 (3 alpha,5,7 alpha-trihydroxy-24-nor-5 beta-cholan-23-oic acid), which was also secreted into bile without appreciable further biotransformation. The site of hydroxylation was assigned by 13C and 1H NMR and mass spectrometry. 5-Hydroxylation was a major biotransformation pathway at physiological bile acid loads. 5-Hydroxylation of UDCA also occurred in the perfused rat liver but to a lesser extent. 5-Hydroxylation of nor-UDCA was not observed in rabbit, dog, or man, indicating that its formation is species-specific. 5-Hydroxylation of nor-CDCA and nor-UDCA is the first reported example of hydroxylation of a tertiary carbon atom of bile acids. Nor-dihydroxy bile acids appear to be useful for the detection of minor hydroxylation pathways, because their prolonged hepatobiliary retention exposes them repeatedly to hydroxylases present in the hepatobiliary system."
