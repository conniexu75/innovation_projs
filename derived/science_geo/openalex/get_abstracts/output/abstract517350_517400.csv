Neuronal computation and normal functioning of the CNS requires tight control of the chemical composition of the neuronal “milieu” that is maintained by the blood-brain barrier (BBB) (Iadecola, 2004Iadecola C.

Brain endothelial cells and perivascular mural cells, pericytes, form the BBB, which limits entry of neurotoxic plasma-derived proteins, circulating metals, pathogens, red blood cells, and leucocytes into the brain. Studies in murine transgenic models have shown that a chronic BBB breakdown leads to accumulation of blood-derived neurotoxic proteins in the CNS including fibrin, thrombin, hemoglobin, iron-containing hemosiderin, free iron, and/or plasmin (an extracellular matrix-degrading enzyme) causing progressive neurodegeneration with loss of neurons mediated by direct neuronal toxicity, oxidant stress, and/or detachment of neurons from their supporting extracellular matrix (Daneman et al., 2010Daneman R.

Some studies using the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) to plasma ratio of blood-derived albumin, reported BBB damage in AD particularly associated with vascular risk factors (Blennow et al., 1990Blennow K.

Frangione B. Zlokovic B.V.

At what stage BBB breakdown occurs in the living human brain and whether it contributes to cognitive impairment remains, however, controversial. Here, we used an advanced dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI) and post-processing analysis with improved spatial and temporal resolutions to quantify the BBB regional permeability Ktrans constant in the living human brain in individuals with no cognitive impairment (NCI) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Compared to a previous approach limited to measurements of BBB permeability in the white matter (WM) (Taheri et al., 2011aTaheri S. Gasparovic C. Huisa B.N. Adair J.C. Edmonds E. Prestopnik J. Grossetete M. Shah N.J. Wills J. Qualls C. Rosenberg G.A.

Scler. Relat. Disord. 2013; 2: 124-132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), the current method allows simultaneous measurements of BBB Ktrans permeability in different gray and WM regions. Additionally, we analyzed CSF biomarkers of BBB breakdown, injury to brain vascular cells including pericytes and endothelial cells, inflammatory response, neuronal injury (i.e., tau and pTau), and amyloid β-peptides (Aβ). We found an age-dependent BBB breakdown in the hippocampus, a region involved in learning and memory (Squire, 1992Squire L.R. Memory and the hippocampus: a synthesis from findings with rats, monkeys, and humans.Psychol. Rev. 1992; 99: 195-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (4097) Google Scholar) that is damaged early in AD (Braak et al., 1993Braak H. Braak E. Bohl J. Staging of Alzheimer-related cortical destruction.Eur.

Neurol. 2012; 69: 614-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The BBB breakdown in the hippocampus worsened with MCI that correlated with measures of injury to BBB-associated pericytes. NCI and MCI participants were recruited through the University of Southern California Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center (USC ADRC) and Huntington Medical Research Institute (HMRI), Pasadena. NCI and MCI participants were evaluated using the Uniform Data Set (Morris et al., 2006Morris J.C. Weintraub S. Chui H.C. Cummings J. Decarli C. Ferris S. Foster N.L. Galasko D. Graff-Radford N.

Disord. 2009; 23: 91-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar) and additional neuropsychological tests as described in the Supplemental Information. For all participants in this study, the DCE-MRI procedure was approved by the USC Institutional Review Board (IRB) and HMRI IRB. Lumbar puncture was approved for older NCI and MCI participants by the USC IRB and HMRI IRB. We studied 12 CNS regions including hippocampus and its subdivisions CA1, CA3, and dentate gyrus (DG), different cortical regions, subcortical regions (e.g., thalamus, striatum, and caudate nucleus), and the WM regions including corpus callosum and internal capsule (Figures 1A and 1B ) and generated regional Ktrans BBB permeability maps for each individual using a modified Patlak linearized regression mathematical analysis (Patlak and Blasberg, 1985Patlak C.S. Blasberg R.G. Graphical evaluation of blood-to-brain transfer constants from multiple-time uptake data. Generalizations.J. Cereb. Blood Flow Metab. 1985; 5: 584-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (1398) Google Scholar) (Figure 1C). We determined in each individual the arterial input function (AIF) from the common carotid artery instead of using an average value from the superior sagittal venous sinus to determine tracer concentration in blood (Taheri et al., 2011aTaheri S. Gasparovic C. Huisa B.N. Adair J.C. Edmonds E. Prestopnik J. Grossetete M. Shah N.J. Wills J. Qualls C. Rosenberg G.A.

Med. 2009; 62: 1270-1281Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Individual AIF measurements are important particularly if the studied population diverges by age as changes in blood volume and flow may affect AIF and the Ktrans measurements. Unexpectedly, we found that NCI individuals (Table 1) have an age-dependent progressive loss of BBB integrity in the hippocampus, as shown by an age-dependent increase in the Ktrans values in the entire hippocampus, its CA1 region, and DG, but not the CA3 region (Figures 1D–1G). No significant BBB changes during aging were found in cortical (e.g., frontal cortex, temporal cortex) or subcortical (e.g., thalamus, striatum) regions except for the caudate nucleus (Figures S1A–S1E). Surprisingly, we did not find significant age-dependent changes in the BBB in subcortical WM fibers, corpus callosum, and internal capsule (Figures S1F–S1H), even though WM is believed to be affected by vascular changes early in AD (Iadecola, 2013Iadecola C. The pathobiology of vascular dementia.Neuron. 2013; 80: 844-866Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1036) Google Scholar, Yoshita et al., 2006Yoshita M. Fletcher E. Harvey D. Ortega M.

Extent and distribution of white matter hyperintensities in normal aging, MCI, and AD.Neurology. 2006; 67: 2192-2198Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). Collectively, our data suggest that early vascular leakage in the aging human brain begins in the hippocampus, which normally shows the highest barrier properties (i.e., the lowest Ktrans values) compared to other brain regions.Table 1Participants’ Demographic InformationNCI, YoungNCI, OlderMCIMSClinical Dementia Rating scale000.50Number of participants6182119Female50%55.6%52.4%63.2%Age range23–4755–9155–8526–53DCE-MRI6/618/1820/2119/19Lumbar puncture0/615/1817/210/19Age at lumbar puncture, Mean (SD)N/A73.2 (10.6)72.0 (8.5)N/ANCI, no cognitive impairment; MCI, mild cognitive impairment; MS, multiple sclerosis; DCE-MRI, dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI; SD, standard deviation; N/A, not applicable.

Next, we compared the BBB permeability in young NCI and older NCI (both CDR = 0) and MCI (CDR = 0.5) groups (Figure 2; Table 1). We found a significant increase in the BBB permeability Ktrans values in the hippocampus (Figure 2A) and its CA1 and DG regions, but not CA3, by 41%, 107%, and 48% in the older compared to the young NCI group and by 24%, 53%, and 27% in MCI compared to age-matched older NCI controls, respectively (Figures 2B–2E). In contrast, there were no significant differences in the BBB permeability in cortical, subcortical, and WM regions between young and older NCI and/or MCI and age-matched older NCI participants (Table S1), except for an increase in the caudate nucleus in older compared to young NCI group. We did not find significant changes in hippocampal volumes between the studied groups determined on coronal T2-weighted MRIs (Figure 3).Figure 3Hippocampus Volume in the Studied GroupsShow full captionHippocampus volume was determined on T2-weighted images in individuals with no cognitive impairment (NCI), with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and multiple sclerosis (MS) cases with no cognitive impairment.

To validate our method, we studied multiple sclerosis (MS) cases with established BBB breakdown in the WM, as reported (Taheri et al., 2011bTaheri S. Gasparovic C. Shah N.J. Rosenberg G.A. Quantitative measurement of blood-brain barrier permeability in human using dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI with fast T1 mapping.Magn. Reson. Med. 2011; 65: 1036-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), as an additional neurological control. MS cases had a diagnosis of the relapsing remitting MS and met McDonald Criteria (Polman et al., 2011Polman C.H. Reingold S.C. Banwell B. Clanet M. Cohen J.A. Filippi M. Fujihara K. Havrdova E. Hutchinson M. Kappos L. et al.Diagnostic criteria for multiple sclerosis: 2010 revisions to the McDonald criteria.Ann. Neurol. 2011; 69: 292-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (6950) Google Scholar). We selected younger MS cases without cognitive complaints that were age-matched to younger NCI controls (Table 1). The MS patients did not show changes in the Ktrans values in the hippocampus or hippocampal subregions (Figures 2B–2E), or in other CNS gray matter regions (Table S1). They had, however, increased BBB permeability in the total WM, corpus callosum, and internal capsule compared to age-matched younger NCI group by 32%, 26%, and 23% (p < 0.001), respectively (Table S1), consistent with the reported BBB alterations in the WM in MS (Taheri et al., 2011bTaheri S.

Our data extend importantly previous findings by showing no changes in the BBB integrity in the hippocampus and other studied gray matter regions in MS.

The increase in the CSF/plasma albumin ratio correlated with an increase in the Ktrans values in the hippocampus and its CA1 and DG subregions (Figures S2B–S2D) that showed an increase in the BBB permeability in MCI compared to age-matched NCI controls (Figures 2B, 2C, and 2E). Next, we studied correlations between Ktrans values and CSF levels of soluble platelet-derived growth factor receptor β (sPDGFRβ). PDGFRβ is an established marker of the BBB-associated pericytes (Armulik et al., 2010Armulik A. Genové G. Mäe M. Nisancioglu M.H. Wallgard E. Niaudet C. He L. Norlin J. Lindblom P.

https://openalex.org/W2109242838,"Ventral tegmental area (VTA) dopamine (DA) neurons have been implicated in reward, aversion, salience, cognition, and several neuropsychiatric disorders. Optogenetic approaches involving transgenic Cre-driver mouse lines provide powerful tools for dissecting DA-specific functions. However, the emerging complexity of VTA circuits requires Cre-driver mouse lines that restrict transgene expression to a precisely defined cell population. Because of recent work reporting that VTA DA neurons projecting to the lateral habenula release GABA, but not DA, we performed an extensive anatomical, molecular, and functional characterization of prominent DA transgenic mouse driver lines. We find that transgenes under control of the tyrosine hydroxylase, but not the dopamine transporter, promoter exhibit dramatic non-DA cell-specific expression patterns within and around VTA nuclei. Our results demonstrate how Cre expression in unintentionally targeted cells in transgenic mouse lines can confound the interpretation of supposedly cell-type-specific experiments.

https://openalex.org/W2073895917,"Neurons in sensory cortex integrate multiple influences to parse objects and support perception. Across multiple cortical areas, integration is characterized by two neuronal response properties: (1) surround suppression--modulatory contextual stimuli suppress responses to driving stimuli; and (2) ""normalization""--responses to multiple driving stimuli add sublinearly. These depend on input strength: for weak driving stimuli, contextual influences facilitate or more weakly suppress and summation becomes linear or supralinear. Understanding the circuit operations underlying integration is critical to understanding cortical function and disease. We present a simple, general theory. A wealth of integrative properties, including the above, emerge robustly from four cortical circuit properties: (1) supralinear neuronal input/output functions; (2) sufficiently strong recurrent excitation; (3) feedback inhibition; and (4) simple spatial properties of intracortical connections. Integrative properties emerge dynamically as circuit properties, with excitatory and inhibitory neurons showing similar behaviors. In new recordings in visual cortex, we confirm key model predictions."

Here we report a carbon–carbon bond cleavage at ambient conditions by a Au(i) complex that generates a stable Au(iii) cationic complex. In contrast to the well-established soft and carbophilic Au(i) catalyst, this Au(iii) complex exhibits hard, oxophilic Lewis acidity. For example, we observed catalytic activation of α,β-unsaturated aldehydes towards selective conjugate additions as well as activation of an unsaturated aldehyde-allene for a [2 + 2] cycloaddition reaction. The origin of the regioselectivity and catalytic activity was elucidated by X-ray crystallographic analysis of an isolated Au(iii)-activated cinnamaldehyde intermediate. The concepts revealed suggest a strategy for accessing high-valent transition-metal catalysis from readily available precursors. The facile synthesis of a stable Au(III) cationic complex is described; this gold catalyst exhibits hard, oxophilic Lewis acidity, enabling selective conjugate additions and a [2 + 2] cycloaddition reaction. High-valent transition metal catalysis is a potentially rich resource for synthetic chemists but is largely untapped due to the high reactivity of the complexes involved and the difficulty in synthesizing them. This study reports the development of a more easily prepared, stable and tunable gold(III) catalyst that provides a strategy for accessing high-valent transition metal catalysis from readily available precursors. The authors use a mild carbon–carbon bond cleavage reaction by a Au(I) complex to generate a stable Au(III) cationic complex. This complex can activate α,β-unsaturated aldehydes towards selective conjugate additions and an unsaturated aldehyde–allene for a [2+2] cycloaddition reaction."
https://openalex.org/W1992780981,"Neuronal networks are dynamically modified by selective synapse pruning during development and adulthood. However, how certain connections win the competition with others and are subsequently maintained is not fully understood. Here, we show that C1ql1, a member of the C1q family of proteins, is provided by climbing fibers (CFs) and serves as a crucial anterograde signal to determine and maintain the single-winner CF in the mouse cerebellum throughout development and adulthood. C1ql1 specifically binds to the brain-specific angiogenesis inhibitor 3 (Bai3), which is a member of the cell-adhesion G-protein-coupled receptor family and expressed on postsynaptic Purkinje cells. C1ql1-Bai3 signaling is required for motor learning but not for gross motor performance or coordination. Because related family members of C1ql1 and Bai3 are expressed in various brain regions, the mechanism described here likely applies to synapse formation, maintenance, and function in multiple neuronal circuits essential for important brain functions."

To obtain a more complete picture of the mechanisms involved in memory, we combined memory training with genome-wide transcriptional analysis of C. elegans CREB mutants. This approach identified 757 significant CREB/memory-induced targets and confirmed the involvement of known memory genes from other organisms, but also suggested new mechanisms and novel components that may be conserved through mammals. CREB mediates distinct basal and memory transcriptional programs at least partially through spatial restriction of CREB activity: basal targets are regulated primarily in nonneuronal tissues, while memory targets are enriched for neuronal expression, emanating from CREB activity in AIM neurons. This suite of novel memory-associated genes will provide a platform for the discovery of orthologous mammalian long-term memory components."

As neuronal populations contribute to multiple representations, we reasoned plasticity in one representation might influence others. We used human fMRI repetition suppression to show that plasticity induced by learning another individual's values impacts upon a value representation for oneself in medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), a plasticity also evident behaviorally in a preference shift. We show this plasticity is driven by a striatal ""prediction error,"" signaling the discrepancy between the other's choice and a subject's own preferences. Thus, our data highlight that mPFC encodes agent-independent representations of subjective value, such that prediction errors simultaneously update multiple agents' value representations. As the resulting change in representational similarity predicts interindividual differences in the malleability of subjective preferences, our findings shed mechanistic light on complex human processes such as the powerful influence of social interaction on beliefs and preferences."
https://openalex.org/W2031178639,"The use of Cre-driver rodent lines for targeting ventral tegmental area (VTA) cell types has generated important and novel insights into how precise neurocircuits regulate physiology and behavior. While this approach generally results in enhanced cellular specificity, an important issue has recently emerged related to the selectivity and penetrance of viral targeting of VTA neurons using several Cre-driver transgenic mouse lines. Here, we highlight several considerations when utilizing these tools to study the function of genetically defined neurocircuits. While VTA dopaminergic neurons have previously been targeted and defined by the expression of single genes important for aspects of dopamine neurotransmission, many VTA and neighboring cells display dynamic gene expression phenotypes that are partially consistent with both classically described dopaminergic and non-dopaminergic neurons. Thus, in addition to varying degrees of selectivity and penetrance, distinct Cre lines likely permit targeting of partially overlapping, but not identical VTA cell populations.

https://openalex.org/W2035979823,"Nanomagnetic imaging has been used to obtain a palaeomagnetic time series of two pallasite meteorites, revealing that their convection was driven by core solidification, which would have caused long-lived magnetic fields in the cores of early Solar System planetary bodies. Shortly after the birth of the Solar System, small planetary bodies became hot enough to segregate into a liquid metal core surrounded by rocky mantle. As the core cooled and froze, swirling motions of liquid metal, driven by the expulsion of sulphur from the growing inner core, generated a magnetic field. A class of meteorites known as pallasites preserves this phase of Solar System history as in the form of gem-quality crystals of the silicate mineral olivine embedded in a metallic matrix of iron–nickel alloy. James Bryson et al. use high-resolution magnetic imaging of the iron–nickel matrix of the Imilac and Esquel pallasite meteorites to derive a time-series record of magnetic activity on the pallasite parent body, encoded within nanoscale intergrowths of iron-rich and nickel-rich phases. This record captures the dying moments of the magnetic field generated as the liquid core solidified, providing evidence for a long-lasting magnetic dynamo driven by compositional convection. Palaeomagnetic measurements of meteorites1,2,3,4,5 suggest that, shortly after the birth of the Solar System, the molten metallic cores of many small planetary bodies convected vigorously and were capable of generating magnetic fields6. Convection on these bodies is currently thought to have been thermally driven7,8, implying that magnetic activity would have been short-lived9. Here we report a time-series palaeomagnetic record derived from nanomagnetic imaging10 of the Imilac and Esquel pallasite meteorites, a group of meteorites consisting of centimetre-sized metallic and silicate phases. We find a history of long-lived magnetic activity on the pallasite parent body, capturing the decay and eventual shutdown of the magnetic field as core solidification completed. We demonstrate that magnetic activity driven by progressive solidification of an inner core11,12,13 is consistent with our measured magnetic field characteristics and cooling rates14. Solidification-driven convection was probably common among small body cores15, and, in contrast to thermally driven convection, will have led to a relatively late (hundreds of millions of years after accretion), long-lasting, intense and widespread epoch of magnetic activity among these bodies in the early Solar System."
https://openalex.org/W1964619735,"The importance of AMPK in regulation of fatty acid (FA) oxidation in skeletal muscle with contraction/exercise is unresolved. Using a mouse model lacking both AMPKα1 and -α2 in skeletal muscle specifically (mdKO), we hypothesized that FA utilization would be impaired in skeletal muscle. AMPKα mdKO mice displayed normal respiratory exchange ratio (RER) when fed chow or a high-fat diet, or with prolonged fasting. However, in vivo treadmill exercise at the same relative intensity induced a higher RER in AMPKα mdKO mice compared to wild-type (WT = 0.81 ± 0.01 (sem); mdKO = 0.87 ± 0.02 (sem); P < 0.01), indicating a decreased utilization of FA. Further, ex vivo contraction-induced FA oxidation was impaired in AMPKα mdKO muscle, suggesting that the increased RER during exercise originated from decreased skeletal muscle FA oxidation. A decreased muscle protein expression of CD36 (cluster of differentiation 36) and FABPpm (plasma membrane fatty acid binding protein) (by ~17-40%), together with fully abolished TBC1D1 (tre-2/USP6, BUB2, cdc16 domain family member 1) Ser237 phosphorylation during contraction/exercise in AMPKα mdKO mice, may impair FA transport capacity and FA transport protein translocation to sarcolemma, respectively.

https://openalex.org/W2090365424,"Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common form of liver disease, and 10% to 20% of NAFLD patients progress to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). The molecular pathways controlling progression to NAFLD/NASH remain poorly understood. We recently identified serine/threonine protein kinase 25 (STK25) as a regulator of whole-body insulin and glucose homeostasis. This study investigates the role of STK25 in liver lipid accumulation and NASH. Stk25 transgenic mice challenged with a high-fat diet displayed a dramatic increase in liver steatosis and hepatic insulin resistance compared to wild-type siblings. Focal fibrosis, hepatocellular damage, and inflammation were readily seen in transgenic but not wild-type livers. Transgenic livers displayed reduced β-oxidation and triacylglycerol secretion, while lipid uptake and synthesis remained unchanged. STK25 was associated with lipid droplets, colocalizing with the main hepatic lipid droplet-coating protein adipose differentiation-related protein, the level of which was increased 3.8 ± 0.7-fold in transgenic livers (P < 0.01), while a key hepatic lipase, adipose triacylglycerol lipase, was translocated from the lipid droplets surface to the cytoplasm, providing the likely mechanism underlying the effect of STK25. In summary, STK25 is a lipid droplet-associated protein that promotes NAFLD through control of lipid release from the droplets for β-oxidation and triacylglycerol secretion. STK25 also drives pathogenesis of NASH.—Amrutkar, M., Cansby, E., Nuñez-Durán, E., Pirazzi, C., Ståhlman, M., Stenfeldt, E., Smith, U., Borén, J., Mahlapuu, M.

https://openalex.org/W2153745341,"Background Respiratory mechanics models can aid in optimising patient-specific mechanical ventilation (MV), but the applications are limited to fully sedated MV patients who have little or no spontaneously breathing efforts. This research presents a time-varying elastance (Edrs) model that can be used in spontaneously breathing patients to determine their respiratory mechanics. Methods A time-varying respiratory elastance model is developed with a negative elastic component (Edemand), to describe the driving pressure generated during a patient initiated breathing cycle. Data from 22 patients who are partially mechanically ventilated using Pressure Support (PS) and Neurally Adjusted Ventilatory Assist (NAVA) are used to investigate the physiology relevance of the time-varying elastance model and its clinical potential. Edrs of every breathing cycle for each patient at different ventilation modes are presented for comparison. Results At the start of every breathing cycle initiated by patient, Edrs is < 0. This negativity is attributed from the Edemand due to a positive lung volume intake at through negative pressure in the lung compartment. The mapping of Edrs trajectories was able to give unique information to patients’ breathing variability under different ventilation modes. The area under the curve of Edrs (AUCEdrs) for most patients is > 25 cmH2Os/l and thus can be used as an acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) severity indicator. Conclusion The Edrs model captures unique dynamic respiratory mechanics for spontaneously breathing patients with respiratory failure. The model is fully general and is applicable to both fully controlled and partially assisted MV modes."

Proinflammatory cytokines could contribute to ischemia-related blood-brain barrier dysfunction. IL-6 increases vascular endothelial cell monolayer permeability in vitro. However, contributions of IL-6 to blood-brain barrier abnormalities have not been examined in the immature brain in vivo. We generated pharmacologic quantities of ovine-specific neutralizing anti-IL-6 mAbs and systemically infused mAbs into fetal sheep at 126 days of gestation after exposure to brain ischemia. Anti-IL-6 mAbs were measured by ELISA in fetal plasma, cerebral cortex, and cerebrospinal fluid, blood-brain barrier permeability was quantified using the blood-to-brain transfer constant in brain regions, and IL-6, tight junction proteins, and plasmalemma vesicle protein (PLVAP) were detected by Western immunoblot. Anti-IL-6 mAb infusions resulted in increases in mAb (P < 0.05) in plasma, brain parenchyma, and cerebrospinal fluid and decreases in brain IL-6 protein. Twenty-four hours after ischemia, anti-IL-6 mAb infusions attenuated ischemia-related increases in blood-brain barrier permeability and modulated tight junction and PLVAP protein expression in fetal brain. We conclude that inhibiting the effects of IL-6 protein with systemic infusions of neutralizing antibodies attenuates ischemia-related increases in blood-brain barrier permeability by inhibiting IL-6 and modulates tight junction proteins after ischemia."

Here, we investigated how exercise signals β cells in T1D condition. For this, we used several approaches. Wild-type and IL-6 knockout (KO) C57BL/6 mice were exercised. Afterward, islets from control and trained mice were exposed to inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β plus IFN-γ). Islets from control mice and β-cell lines (INS-1E and MIN6) were incubated with serum from control or trained mice or medium obtained from 5-aminoimidazole-4 carboxamide 1-β-d-ribofuranoside (AICAR)-treated C2C12 skeletal muscle cells. Subsequently, islets and β cells were exposed to IL-1β plus IFN-γ. Proteins were assessed by immunoblotting, apoptosis was determined by DNA-binding dye propidium iodide fluorescence, and NO* was estimated by nitrite. Exercise reduced 25, 75, and 50% of the IL-1β plus IFN-γ-induced iNOS, nitrite, and cleaved caspase-3 content, respectively, in pancreatic islets. Serum from trained mice and medium from AICAR-treated C2C12 cells reduced β-cell death, induced by IL-1β plus IFN-γ treatment, in 15 and 38%, respectively.

This new approach is based on estimating the overlap between the distribution of species through a kernel interpolation of centroids of species distribution and areas of influence defined from the distance between the centroid and the farthest point of occurrence of each species. We used this method to delimit areas of endemism of spiders from Brazil. To assess the effectiveness of GIE, we analyzed the same data using Parsimony Analysis of Endemism and NDM and compared the areas identified through each method. The analyses using GIE identified 101 areas of endemism of spiders in Brazil GIE demonstrated to be effective in identifying areas of endemism in multiple scales, with fuzzy edges and supported by more synendemic species than in the other methods. The areas of endemism identified with GIE were generally congruent with those identified for other taxonomic groups, suggesting that common processes can be responsible for the origin and maintenance of these biogeographic units."

This study reports on the sleep hygiene of urban Chinese school students, and investigates the relationship between habitual after-school activities and sleep duration, schedule and quality on a regular school day. Methods Cross-sectional, school-based survey of school children (Grades 4–8) living in Shanghai, China, conducted in 2011. Self-reported data were collected on students’ sleep duration and timing, sleep quality, habitual after-school activities (i.e. homework, leisure-time physical activity, recreational screen time and school commuting time), and potential correlates. Results Mean sleep duration of this sample (mean age: 11.5-years; 48.6% girls) was 9 hours. Nearly 30% of students reported daytime tiredness. On school nights, girls slept less (p<0.001) and went to bed later (p<0.001), a sex difference that was more pronounced in older students. Age by sex interactions were observed for both sleep duration (p=0.005) and bedtime (p=0.002). Prolonged time spent on homework and mobile phone playing was related to shorter sleep duration and later bedtime. Adjusting for all other factors, with each additional hour of mobile phone playing, the odds of daytime tiredness and having difficulty maintaining sleep increased by 30% and 27% among secondary students, respectively. Conclusion There are sex differences in sleep duration, schedule and quality. Habitual activities had small but significant associations with sleep hygiene outcomes especially among secondary school students. Intervention strategies such as limiting children’s use of electronic screen devices after school are implicated."

This study aimed to determine the incidence, characteristics, and determinants of maternal near misses in Morocco.A prospective case-control study was conducted at 3 referral maternity hospitals in the Marrakech region of Morocco between February and July 2012. Near-miss cases included severe hemorrhage, hypertensive disorders, and prolonged obstructed labor. Three unmatched controls were selected for each near-miss case. Three categories of risk factors (sociodemographics, reproductive history, and delays), as well as perinatal outcomes, were assessed, and bivariate and multivariate analyses of the determinants were performed. A sample of 30 near misses and 30 non-near misses was interviewed.The incidence of near misses was 12‰ of births. Hypertensive disorders during pregnancy (45%) and severe hemorrhage (39%) were the most frequent direct causes of near miss. The main risk factors were illiteracy [OR = 2.35; 95% CI: (1.07-5.15)], lack of antenatal care [OR = 3.97; 95% CI: (1.42-11.09)], complications during pregnancy [OR = 2.81; 95% CI:(1.26-6.29)], and having experienced a first phase delay [OR = 8.71; 95% CI: (3.97-19.12)] and a first phase of third delay [OR = 4.03; 95% CI: (1.75-9.25)]. The main reasons for the first delay were lack of a family authority figure who could make a decision, lack of sufficient financial resources, lack of a vehicle, and fear of health facilities. The majority of near misses demonstrated a third delay with many referrals. The women's perceptions of the quality of their care highlighted the importance of information, good communication, and attitude.Women and newborns with serious obstetric complications have a greater chance of successful outcomes if they are immediately directed to a functioning referral hospital and if the providers are responsive."

We hypothesized that JMJD1A, an H3K9 demethylase involved in adipogenic metabolism, could regulate PPARγ. In human HSC cell line, rat primary HSCs, and carbontetrachloride-induced mouse liver fibrogenesis model, we down-regulated the expression of JMJD1A using small interfering or short hairpin RNAs, and overexpressed its wild-type and mutant. We analyzed the effects of JMJD1A manipulation on the histone di-methyl-H3K9 (H3k9me2) status of PPARγ gene and the expression of PPARγ and fibrosis markers using chromatin immunoprecipitation, real-time quantitative RT-PCR and Western blot, and also investigated the in vitro and in vivo consequences on liver fibrosis and necrosis by Masson or hematoxylin-eosin staining, respectively. JMJD1A knockdown in HSCs correlated with reinforced H3K9me2 in the PPARγ gene promoter, and its down-regulation in both mRNA and protein led to increased expression of fibrosis markers, which could be consistently rescued by JMJD1A overexpression. Jmjd1a knockdown in situ resulted in significantly increased expression of α-smooth muscle actin (P = 0.005) and Col1a (P = 0.036), strengthened production of collagens (P = 0.028), and remarkably enhanced necrosis (P = 0.007) 4 weeks after treatment.

Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) has a cytoprotective effect on lung endothelial cells; however, the mechanism is uncertain. We postulate that the MIF receptor CD74 mediates this protective effect. Using adult wild-type (WT), MIF-deficient (Mif-/-), CD74-deficient (Cd74-/-) mice and MIF receptor inhibitor treated mice, we report that MIF deficiency or inhibition of MIF receptor binding results in increased sensitivity to hyperoxia. Mif-/- and Cd74-/- mice demonstrated decreased median survival following hyperoxia compared to WT mice. Mif-/- mice demonstrated an increase in bronchoalveolar protein (48%) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (68%) following 72 hours of hyperoxia. Similarly, treatment with MIF receptor antagonist resulted in a 59% and 91% increase in bronchoalveolar lavage protein and LDH, respectively. Inhibition of CD74 in primary murine lung endothelial cells (MLECs) abrogated the protective effect of MIF, including decreased hyperoxia-mediated AKT phosphorylation and a 20% reduction in the anti-apoptotic effect of exogenous MIF.

In this work we selected fungal genes encoding for laccase enzymes GlLCC1 in Ganoderma lucidum and POXA 1B in Pleurotus ostreatus. These genes were optimized for codon use, GC content, and regions generating secondary structures. Laccase proposed computational models, and their interaction with ABTS [2, 2′-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid)] substrate was evaluated by molecular docking. Synthetic genes were cloned under the control of Pichia pastoris glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAP) constitutive promoter. P. pastoris X-33 was transformed with pGAPZαA-LaccGluc-Stop and pGAPZαA-LaccPost-Stop constructs. Optimization reduced GC content by 47 and 49% for LaccGluc-Stop and LaccPost-Stop genes, respectively. A codon adaptation index of 0.84 was obtained for both genes. 3D structure analysis using SuperPose revealed LaccGluc-Stop is similar to the laccase crystallographic structure 1GYC of Trametes versicolor. Interaction analysis of the 3D models validated through ABTS, demonstrated higher substrate affinity for LaccPost-Stop, in agreement with our experimental results with enzymatic activities of 451.08 ± 6.46 UL-1 compared to activities of 0.13 ± 0.028 UL-1 for LaccGluc-Stop. This study demonstrated that G. lucidum GlLCC1 and P. ostreatus POXA 1B gene optimization resulted in constitutive gene expression under GAP promoter and α-factor leader in P. pastoris. These are important findings in light of recombinant enzyme expression system utility for environmentally friendly designed expression systems, because of the wide range of substrates that laccases can transform. This contributes to a great gamut of products in diverse settings: industry, clinical and chemical use, and environmental applications."
https://openalex.org/W2001893738,"This study aimed to examine the association between negative life events (NLEs) and attempted suicide in rural China.Six rural counties were selected from disease surveillance points in Shandong province, China. A total of 409 suicide attempters in rural areas between October 1, 2009, and March 31, 2011, and an equal number of matched controls were interviewed. We compared negative life events experienced within 1 month, 1-3 months, 3-6 months, and 6-2 months prior to attempted suicide for cases and prior to interview for controls. We used multivariate logistic regression to examine the association between NLEs and attempted suicide.Suicide attempters experienced more NLEs within the last year prior to suicide attempt than controls prior to interview (83.1% vs. 33.5%). There was a significant dose-response relationship between NLEs experienced within the last year and increased risk of attempted suicide. Timing of NLEs analysis showed that NLEs experienced in the last month and 6-12 months prior to suicide attempt were significantly associated with elevated risk of attempted suicide, even after adjusting for mental disorders and demographic factors. Of NLEs, quarrelling with spouse, quarrelling with other family members, conflicting with friends or neighbors, family financial difficulty, and serious illness were independently related to attempted suicide.NLEs are significantly associated with increased risk for attempted suicide in rural China. Stress management and intervention may be important to prevent suicidal behavior in rural China."
https://openalex.org/W2082299829,"Recent evidence suggests Alzheimer-Disease (AD) to be driven by aggregated Aß. Capitalizing on the mechanism of molecular mimicry and applying several selection layers, we screened peptide libraries for moieties inducing antibodies selectively reacting with Aß-aggregates. The technology identified a pool of peptide candidates; two, AFFITOPES AD01 and AD02, were assessed as vaccination antigens and compared to Aβ1-6, the targeted epitope. When conjugated to Keyhole Limpet Hemocyanin (KLH) and adjuvanted with aluminum, all three peptides induced Aß-targeting antibodies (Abs). In contrast to Aß1-6, AD01- or AD02-induced Abs were characterized by selectivity for aggregated forms of Aß and absence of reactivity with related molecules such as Amyloid Precursor Protein (APP)/ secreted APP-alpha (sAPPa). Administration of AFFITOPE-vaccines to APP-transgenic mice was found to reduce their cerebral amyloid burden, the associated neuropathological alterations and to improve their cognitive functions. Thus, the AFFITOME-technology delivers vaccines capable of inducing a distinct Ab response. Their features may be beneficial to AD-patients, a hypothesis currently tested within a phase-II-study."
https://openalex.org/W1980022683,"Most general theories on serial order working memory (WM) assume the existence of position markers that are bound to the to-be-remembered items to keep track of the serial order. So far, the exact cognitive/neural characteristics of these markers have remained largely underspecified, while direct empirical evidence for their existence is mostly lacking. In the current study we demonstrate that retrieval from verbal serial order WM can be facilitated or hindered by spatial cuing: begin elements of a verbal WM sequence are retrieved faster after cuing the left side of space, while end elements are retrieved faster after cuing the right side of space. In direct complement to our previous work—where we showed the reversed impact of WM retrieval on spatial processing—we argue that the current findings provide us with a crucial piece of evidence suggesting a direct and functional involvement of space in verbal serial order WM. We outline the idea that serial order in verbal WM is coded within a spatial coordinate system with spatial attention being involved when searching through WM, and we discuss how this account can explain several hallmark observations related to serial order WM."
https://openalex.org/W2026204084,"Forest roosting bats use a variety of ephemeral roosts such as snags and declining live trees. Although conservation of summer maternity habitat is considered critical for forest-roosting bats, bat response to roost loss still is poorly understood. To address this, we monitored 3 northern long-eared bat (Myotis septentrionalis) maternity colonies on Fort Knox Military Reservation, Kentucky, USA, before and after targeted roost removal during the dormant season when bats were hibernating in caves. We used 2 treatments: removal of a single highly used (primary) roost and removal of 24% of less used (secondary) roosts, and an un-manipulated control. Neither treatment altered the number of roosts used by individual bats, but secondary roost removal doubled the distances moved between sequentially used roosts. However, overall space use by and location of colonies was similar pre- and post-treatment. Patterns of roost use before and after removal treatments also were similar but bats maintained closer social connections after our treatments. Roost height, diameter at breast height, percent canopy openness, and roost species composition were similar pre- and post-treatment. We detected differences in the distribution of roosts among decay stages and crown classes pre- and post-roost removal, but this may have been a result of temperature differences between treatment years. Our results suggest that loss of a primary roost or ≤ 20% of secondary roosts in the dormant season may not cause northern long-eared bats to abandon roosting areas or substantially alter some roosting behaviors in the following active season when tree-roosts are used. Critically, tolerance limits to roost loss may be dependent upon local forest conditions, and continued research on this topic will be necessary for conservation of the northern long-eared bat across its range."
https://openalex.org/W2016555609,"Objective To assess the specific prefrontal activity in comparison to those in the other main cortical areas in primary insomnia patients and in good sleepers. Methods Fourteen primary insomnia patients and 11 good sleepers were included in the analysis. Participants completed one night of polysomnography in the sleep lab. Power spectra were calculated during the NREM (Non-rapid eyes movements) and the REM (Rapid eyes movements) sleep periods at prefrontal, occipital, temporal and central electrode positions. Results During the NREM sleep, the power spectra did not differ between groups in the prefrontal cortex; while primary insomnia patients exhibited a higher beta power spectrum and a lower delta power spectrum compared to good sleepers in other areas. During the REM sleep, the beta1 power spectrum was lower in the prefrontal cortex in primary insomnia patients compared to good sleepers; while no significant difference between groups was obtained for the other areas. Conclusions The present study shows a specific prefrontal sleep pattern during the whole sleep period. In addition, we suggest that primary insomnia patients displayed a dysfunction in the reactivation of the limbic system during the REM sleep and we give additional arguments in favor of a sleep-protection mechanism displayed by primary insomnia patients."
https://openalex.org/W2110683192,"Depressive symptoms during pregnancy are common and may have impact on the developing child. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are the most prescribed antidepressant treatment, but unfortunately, these treatments can also negatively affect the behavioral development and health of a child during pregnancy. In addition, serotonin (5-HT) exerts neurotrophic actions with thus far not fully known effects in the offspring. The neurotrophic growth factor (NGF) is involved in neuronal cell survival and differentiation, and altered placenta levels have been found to increase the risk for pregnancy complications, similar to those found in women treated with SSRIs. We therefore investigated whether the NGF signaling pathway was altered in the placenta from women treated with SSRIs (n = 12) and compared them with placenta from depressed (n = 12) and healthy mothers (n = 12). Results from immunohistochemical stainings revealed that placental NGF protein levels of SSRI-treated women were increased in both trophoblasts and endothelial cells compared with depressed and control women. In addition, downstream of the NGF receptor TrkA, increased levels of the signaling proteins ROCK2 and phosphorylated Raf-1 were found in stromal cells and a tendency towards increased levels of ROCK2 in trophoblasts and endothelial cells in SSRI-treated women when compared to healthy controls. SSRI-treated women also displayed increased levels of phosphorylated ROCK2 in all placental cell types studied in comparison with depressed and control women. Interestingly, in placental endothelial cells from depressed women, NGF levels were significantly lower compared to control women, but ROCK2 levels were increased compared with control and SSRI-treated women. Taken together, these results show that the NGF signaling and downstream pathways in the placenta are affected by SSRI treatment and/or antenatal depression. This might lead to an altered placental function, although the clinical relevance of our findings still needs to be investigated."
https://openalex.org/W2036077502,"Models of microbe-elicited peritonitis have been invaluable to identify mechanisms underlying inflammation resolution, but whether resolution mechanisms differ from an inflammatory agent to another has not been determined. Thus, we analyzed the cellular and molecular components of the resolution phase of non-microbe-induced inflammation. In thioglycollate (TG)-induced peritonitis, resolution started at 12 h (Tmax) and displayed a 22 h resolution interval (Ri). During resolution, lipoxin A4, resolvin (Rv) D1 and RvD2, protectin D1 (PD1), and maresin 1 (MaR1) were transiently produced while RvD5 was continually generated. In addition, docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)-derived mediators were produced to a higher extent than in microbial peritonitis. We also investigated leukocyte infiltration and clearance in peritoneal tissues surrounding the inflammatory site. In the omentum, resolution parameters, neutrophil apoptosis, and efferocytosis were similar to those of the peritoneal cavity. However, we noticed long-term persistence of M2-polarized macrophages and B-lymphocytes in the omentum after TG administration, whereas zymosan injection caused M1/M2-macrophage and T-lymphocyte persistence regardless of the magnitude of the inflammatory response. Our study indicates that some aspects of resolution are shaped in a stimulus-specific manner, and it ultimately argues that the tissues surrounding the inflammatory site must also be considered to address the inflammatory response globally."
https://openalex.org/W1994843840,"CacyBP/SIP [calcyclin-binding protein/Siah-1 [seven in absentia homolog 1 (Siah E3 ubiquitin protein ligase 1)] interacting protein] is a multifunctional protein whose activity includes acting as an ERK1/2 phosphatase. We analyzed dimerization of mouse CacyBP/SIP in vitro and in mouse neuroblastoma cell line (NB2a) cells, as well as the structure of a full-length protein. Moreover, we searched for the CacyBP/SIP domain important for dimerization and dephosphorylation of ERK2, and we analyzed the role of dimerization in ERK1/2 signaling in NB2a cells. Cell-based assays showed that CacyBP/SIP forms a homodimer in NB2a cell lysate, and biophysical methods demonstrated that CacyBP/SIP forms a stable dimer in vitro. Data obtained using small-angle X-ray scattering supported a model in which CacyBP/SIP occupies an anti-parallel orientation mediated by the N-terminal dimerization domain. Site-directed mutagenesis established that the N-terminal domain is indispensable for full phosphatase activity of CacyBP/SIP. We also demonstrated that the oligomerization state of CacyBP/SIP as well as the level of post-translational modifications and subcellular distribution of CacyBP/SIP change after activation of the ERK1/2 pathway in NB2a cells due to oxidative stress. Together, our results suggest that dimerization is important for controlling phosphatase activity of CacyBP/SIP and for regulating the ERK1/2 signaling pathway.—Topolska-Woś, A. M., Shell, S.

https://openalex.org/W2152419692,"The mammalian G-protein-coupled receptor 37 (GPR37) is expressed in brain, in adult testis, and during the early phase of gonad differentiation. Somatic Sertoli cells (SCs) are located within the seminiferous tubules where they support the germinal epithelium. An adequate number of SCs is required for the complete prepubertal differentiation of germ cells and adult fertility. This study shows that Gpr37 and its ligand prosaposin are both postnatally expressed by SCs, whose proliferation and maturation are affected in Gpr37-null mutant mice during postnatal testicular development. Mutant pups show a delayed timing in sperm cell development, with a partial arrest of spermatocytes at the meiotic pachytene (e.g., 1.5-fold increase in Gpr37-/- P21 pups) and their increased apoptosis (e.g., 1.8-fold and 3.5-fold increase in Gpr3T-/- P21 and adult mice, respectively). Mutant adults have reduced testis weight (wild type, 299 ± 5 mg; knockout, 258 ±16 mg; P< 0.05) and epididymal sperm count and motility (e.g., 1.5-fold and 1.45-fold decrease in Gpr37-/- mice, respectively). Lack of Gpr37 results in the reduction in androgen receptor levels during prepubertal testis development, alongside the altered expression of SC maturation markers. It also affects the prepubertal testis expression of desert hedgehog (Dhh) mitogenic cascade components (Dhh, 1.3-fold increase in Gpr37-/- P10 and P21 pups; Gli2, 1.4-fold and 1.6-fold increase in Gpr37-/- P10 and P21 pups, respectively) including patched homolog 1 (1.3-fold increase in Gpr3T-/- P10 and P21 pups), which is found localized in prepubertal SCs and is associated with Gpr37 in cultured primary SC samples. These results indicate that Gpr37 is a specific modulator of murine testis Dhh mitogenic signaling and SC proliferation and maturation.—La Sala, G., Marazziti, D., Di Pietro, C., Golini, E., Mateoni, R., Tocchini-Valentini, G.

https://openalex.org/W2011923458,"Here we ask the following: 1) what is the CO2 permeability (Pco2) of unilamellar liposomes composed of L-α-phosphatidylcholine (PC)/L-α-phosphatidylserine (PS) = 4:1 and containing cholesterol (Chol) at levels often occurring in biologic membranes (50 mol%), and 2) does incorporation of the CO2 channel aquaporin (AQP)1 cause a significant increase in membrane Pco2? Presently, a drastic discrepancy exists between the answers to these two questions obtained from mass-spectrometric 18O-exchange measurements (Chol reduces Pco2 100-fold, AQP1 increases Pco2 10-fold) vs. from stopped-flow approaches observing CO2 uptake (no effects of either Chol or AQP1). A novel theory of CO2 uptake by vesicles predicts that in a stopped-flow apparatus this fast process can only be resolved temporally and interpreted quantitatively, if 1) a very low CO2 partial pressure (pCO2) is used (e.g., 18 mmHg), and 2) intravesicular carbonic anhydrase (CA) activity is precisely known. With these prerequisites fulfilled, we find by stopped-flow that 1) Chol-containing vesicles possess a Pco2 = 0.01cm/s, and Chol-free vesicles exhibit ~1 cm/s, and 2) the Pco2 of 0.01 cm/s is increased ≥ 10-fold by AQP1. Both results agree with previous mass-spectrometric results and thus resolve the apparent discrepancy between the two techniques. We confirm that biologic membranes have an intrinsically low Pco2 that can be raised when functionally necessary by incorporating protein-gas channels such as AQP1.—Tsiavaliaris, G., Itel, F., Hedfalk, K., Al-Samir, S., Meier, W., Gros, G., Endeward, V.

The more N-terminal catalytic histidine (herein referred to as Hisnuc, which is His182 in yeast and His263 human Tdp1) functions in the nucleophilic attack on the 3′-phosphoryl-adduct linkage to form a 3′-phosphohistidyl bond between Tdp1 and DNA. A more C-terminal catalytic histidine (referred to as Hisgab, which in yeast is His432 and in human His493) then functions as a general acid/base to activate a water molecule to hydrolyze the Tdp1-DNA linkage, dissociating Tdp1 from the DNA (see Fig. 1B). Tdp1 leaves behind a DNA nick with 3′-phosphoryl and 5′-OH ends, which must be processed by polynucleotide kinase/phosphatase for DNA ligation (18.Caldecott K.W.

A catalytic Hisgab to Arg substitution in human Tdp1 (H493R) was identified in patients with the rare autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disease spinocerebellar ataxia with axonal neuropathy (SCAN1) (13.Takashima H.

Replacing Hisgab with Arg impairs the resolution of the Tdp1-DNA phosphohistidyl linkage, resulting in a longer-lived covalent Tdp1-DNA reaction intermediate in vitro (10.Interthal H. Chen H.J.

Consequently, SCAN1 lymphoblastoid cells or yeast cells expressing the analogous yeast Hisgab to Arg (H432R) mutant are more sensitive to CPT-induced DNA lesions or to oxidative DNA damage induced by H2O2, γ-irradiation, or bleomycin (7.He X. van Waardenburg R.C.

However, in patients, the SCAN1 phenotype is not evident until the second decade of life, is restricted primarily to the neurodegeneration of cerebellar neurons, and is not associated with an increased risk of cancer or immune deficiency (13.Takashima H.

Genet. 2002; 32: 267-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). Thus, the defect in Tdp1 catalysis imparted by the H432R mutation does not suffice to induce acute cellular toxicity; rather it is likely that the cumulative effects of chronic Tdp1-DNA stabilization induce the neuropathology of SCAN1. In structural studies of the analogous SCAN1-like mutation in yeast Tdp1 (H432R), crystallographic data revealed a more shallow catalytic pocket with increased positive charge, in comparison with wild type Tdp1 (23.Gajewski S. Comeaux E.Q. Jafari N. Bharatham N. Bashford D. White S.W. van Waardenburg R.C. Analysis of the active-site mechanism of tyrosyl-DNA phosphodiesterase I: a member of the phospholipase D superfamily.J. Mol. Biol. 2012; 415: 741-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Such alterations in electrostatic potential appear to enhance the noncovalent binding of Tdp1 to DNA. Yet this increment in substrate affinity fails to explain the defect in (H432R) SCAN1 mutant catalysis. For example, a similar change in electrostatic potential and DNA binding was induced in the H432K mutant; however, this substitution did not impair the resolution of the covalent Tdp1-DNA linkage. Indeed, the catalytic activity of this mutant is similar to that of wild type Tdp1 (23.Gajewski S. Comeaux E.Q. Jafari N. Bharatham N. Bashford D. White S.W. van Waardenburg R.C. Analysis of the active-site mechanism of tyrosyl-DNA phosphodiesterase I: a member of the phospholipase D superfamily.J. Mol. Biol. 2012; 415: 741-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In contrast, substitution of Hisgab with residues that contain smaller polar or aliphatic side chains (including Asn, Glu, Leu, Ala, Ser, or Thr) induces an even more severe lethal phenotype, effectively transforming Tdp1 into a potent Top1-dependent cellular toxin, even in the absence of CPT (7.He X. van Waardenburg R.C. Babaoglu K. Price A.C. Nitiss K.C. Nitiss J.L. Bjornsti M.A. White S.W.

To investigate how seemingly subtle alterations in Hisgab have profoundly distinct effects on cell viability, we focused on the coordinated function of Hisgab with Hisnuc during mutant Tdp1 catalysis (see Fig. 1A). For example, mutation of the Hisnuc to Ala in human and yeast Tdp1 has been reported to inhibit Tdp1 catalytic activity in in vitro assays (12.Raymond A.C. Rideout M.C. Staker B. Hjerrild K.

We therefore hypothesized that introducing the HisnucAla mutation into the Hisgab mutant proteins would suppress the enhanced CPT sensitivity of the SCAN1 H432R mutant and the Top1-dependent lethality of the more toxic H432N mutant (7.He X. van Waardenburg R.C.

Defective DNA single-strand break repair in spinocerebellar ataxia with axonal neuropathy-1.Nature. 2005; 434: 108-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, however, we report here that the HisnucAla substitution (H182A) actually potentiated the cytotoxicity of the Hisgab mutants and induced a Top1-independent lethal phenotype in combination with the H432N mutant. In contrast, the introduction of a bulky Phe residue at residue 182 completely suppressed the catalytic activity and the toxicity of the Hisgab mutants. Our findings suggest that in the H182A mutant, a conserved His181 residue provides an alternative nucleophile for substrate hydrolysis, an activity that is constrained by the active site geometry of wild type Tdp1 or the H182F mutant. Moreover, the enhanced flexibility of H182A active site residues appears to impair the resolution of mutant Hisgab covalent phosphohistidyl intermediates. These results are discussed in terms of the catalytic mechanism of Tdp1 and provide the rationale for developing chemotherapeutics that stabilize rather than inhibit the formation of the covalent Tdp1-DNA intermediate.

The constant region of the antibody heavy chain is encoded by multiple groups of exons which define the isotype and therefore many functional characteristics of the antibody. We performed both single B cell RNAseq and long read single molecule sequencing of antibody heavy chain transcripts and were able to identify novel exons for IGHA1 and IGHA2 as well as novel isoforms for IGHM antibody heavy chain.
https://openalex.org/W1967321464,"Different types of genetic and epigenetic changes are associated with HNSCC. The molecular mechanisms of HNSCC carcinogenesis are still undergoing intensive investigation. WWOX gene expression is altered in many cancers and in a recent work reduced WWOX expression has been associated with miR-134 expression in HNSCC. In this study we investigated the WWOX messenger RNA expression levels in association with the promoter methylation of the WWOX gene and miR-134 expression levels in 80 HNSCC tumor and non-cancerous tissue samples. Our results show that WWOX expression is down-regulated especially in advanced-stage tumor samples or in tumors with SCC. This down-regulation was associated with methylation of the WWOX promoter region but not with miR-134 expression. There was an inverse correlation between the expression level and promoter methylation. We also analyzed whole exons and exon/intron boundries of the WWOX gene by direct sequencing. In our study group we observed 10 different alterations in the coding sequences and 18 different alterations in the non-coding sequences of the WWOX gene in HNSCC tumor samples. These results indicate that the WWOX gene can be functionally inactivated by promoter methylation, epigenetically or by mutations affecting the sequences coding for the enzymatic domain of the gene, functionally. We conclude that inactivation of WWOX gene contributes to the progression of HNSCC."
https://openalex.org/W1977388020,"Gene variants of the leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) are associated with susceptibility to Parkinson's disease (PD). Besides brain and periphery, LRRK2 is expressed in various immune cells including dendritic cells (DCs), antigen-presenting cells linking innate and adaptive immunity. However, the function of LRRK2 in the immune system is still incompletely understood. Here, Ca2+-signaling was analyzed in DCs isolated from gene-targeted mice lacking lrrk2 (Lrrk2-/-) and their wild-type littermates (Lrrk2). According to Western blotting, Lrrk2 was expressed in Lrrk2+/+ DCs but not in Lrrk2-/- DCs. Cytosolic Ca2+ levels ([Ca2+]i) were determined utilizing Fura-2 fluorescence and whole cell currents to decipher electrogenic transport. The increase of [Ca2+]i following inhibition of sarcoendoplasmatic Ca2+-ATPase with thapsigargin (1 μM) in the absence of extracellular Ca2+ (Ca2+-release) and the increase of [Ca2+]i following subsequent readdition of extracellular Ca2+ (SOCE) were both significantly larger in Lrrk2-/- than in Lrrk2+/+ DCs. The augmented increase of [Ca2+]i could have been due to impaired Ca2+ extrusion by K+-independent (NCX) and/or K+-dependent (NCKX) Na+/Ca2+-exchanger activity, which was thus determined from the increase of [Ca2+]i, (Δ[Ca2+]i), and current following abrupt replacement of Na+ containing (130 mM) and Ca2+ free (0 mM) extracellular perfusate by Na+ free (0 mM) and Ca2+ containing (2 mM) extracellular perfusate. As a result, both slope and peak of Δ [Ca2+]i as well as Na+/Ca2+ exchanger-induced current were significantly lower in Lrrk2-/- than in Lrrk2+/+ DCs. A 6 or 24 hour treatment with the LRRK2 inhibitor GSK2578215A (1 μM) significantly decreased NCX1 and NCKX1 transcript levels, significantly blunted Na+/Ca2+-exchanger activity, and significantly augmented the increase of [Ca2+]i following Ca2+-release and SOCE. In conclusion, the present observations disclose a completely novel functional significance of LRRK2, i.e., the up-regulation of Na+/Ca2+ exchanger transcription and activity leading to attenuation of Ca2+-signals in DCs.—Yan, J., Almilaji, A., Schmid, E., Elvira, B., Shimshek, D.

https://openalex.org/W1969073113,"Objective Interleukin-8 (IL-8, CXCL8) plays important roles in immune responses at mucosal sites including in the lower genital tract. Since several types of bacteria produce proteases that cleave IL-8 and many types of bacteria can be present in lower genital tract microbiota, we assessed genital fluids for IL-8 cleavage/alteration. Study Design Genital fluids collected by lavage from 200 women (23 HIV-seronegative and 177 HIV-seropositive) were tested for IL-8 cleavage/alteration by ELISA. Results IL-8 cleaving/altering activity was observed in fluids from both HIV-positive (28%) and HIV-negative women (35%). There was no clear relationship between the activity and the types of bacteria present in the lower genital tract as determined by high-throughput sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene. Protease inhibitors specific for matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) reduced the activity and a multiplex assay that detects both inactive and active MMPs showed the presence of multiple MMPs, including MMP-1, -3, -7, -8, -9, -10 and -12 in genital secretions from many of the women. The IL-8-cleaving/altering activity significantly correlated with active MMP-9 as well as with cleavage of a substrate that is acted on by several active MMPs. Conclusions These studies show that multiple MMPs are present in the genital tract of women and strongly suggest that MMP-9 in genital secretions can cleave IL-8 at this mucosal site. These studies suggest that MMP-mediated cleavage of IL-8 can modulate inflammatory responses in the lower genital tract."

The conserved GxGD membrane protease family has received considerable interest, as mutations in the mammalian GxGD membrane protease, presenilin, are the leading cause of early onset familial Alzheimer disease (FAD). 4The abbreviations used are: FADfamilial Alzheimer diseasePSHpresenilin homolog. This family of proteases cuts transmembrane protein substrates using a pair of aspartate residues (1.Wolfe M.S. Xia W. Ostaszewski B.L. Diehl T.S. Kimberly W.T. Selkoe D.J.

Due to the association of presenilin with FAD, efforts have been made to determine the structure of this protein.

Although a cryo-EM structure for the human γ-secretase complex was recently reported, the resolution was not sufficient to probe the exact transmembrane arrangement of presenilin (6.Lu P. Bai X.C.

Recently, two crystal structures in the GxGD protease family, both from archeobacterial sources, have been reported. The first, FlaK, is a preflagellin peptidase with its structure solved at 3.6 Å resolution (7.Hu J. Xue Y. Lee S. Ha Y. The crystal structure of GXGD membrane protease FlaK.Nature. 2011; 475: 528-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Unlike presenilin which has 9 transmembrane domains, FlaK has 6. The second crystal structure is a presenilin homolog (PSH) from M. marisnigri, whose function in the archeobacteria is currently unknown (8.Torres-Arancivia C. Ross C.M. Chavez J. Assur Z. Dolios G.

Wang J. Shi Y. Structure of a presenilin family intramembrane aspartate protease.Nature. 2013; 493: 56-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Like presenilin, it has 9 transmembrane domains, and has 19% identity and over 50% similarity to presenilin-1 (PS1) (9.Li X. Dang S. Yan C. Gong X. Wang J. Shi Y. Structure of a presenilin family intramembrane aspartate protease.Nature. 2013; 493: 56-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). The structural fold of the catalytic regions of FlaK and PSH is consistent with the predicted structure of presenilin (7.Hu J. Xue Y. Lee S. Ha Y.

Interestingly, it has been suggested that presenilin can act as a Ca2+ ion channel, and the dysregulation of Ca2+ activity contributes to the progression of FAD (10.Tu H. Nelson O. Bezprozvanny A.

Traditionally proteins are thought to have one function. As it is not generally thought that proteases can have dual functions as ion channels, we investigated if ion channel activity is present in the GxGD proteases, namely PSH and FlaK, i.e.: if they are chanzymes. We took advantage of the published crystal structures of both of these proteins, and used them as surrogates to investigate if proteases, and by extension, presenilin can also be ion channels. Here, we demonstrate that both PSH and FlaK form cation channels in lipid bilayers. We use a series of mutations in both PSH and FlaK to interrogate the channel activity, and to determine the relationship to the protein secretase function. We also test the ability of FlaK to modify calcium signaling in mammalian cells. A mutation that affected the enzymatic activity of FlaK, rendered the channel catalytically dead and altered the ion selectivity, indicating that the ion channel and the catalytic activities are linked. We report that the GxGD proteases, PSH and FlaK, are the first true “chanzymes” with interdependent ion channel and protease activity conferred by a single structural domain embedded in the membrane. A pET21 bacterial expression was used to express PSH (incorporating the 5 mutations previously identified to increase protein stability: D40N, E42S, A147E, V148P, A229V) and wild type FlaK (WT FlaK) for protein production (7.Hu J. Xue Y. Lee S. Ha Y. The crystal structure of GXGD membrane protease FlaK.Nature. 2011; 475: 528-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 9.Li X. Dang S. Yan C. Gong X. Wang J. Shi Y. Structure of a presenilin family intramembrane aspartate protease.Nature. 2013; 493: 56-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). QuiKChange mutagenesis (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA) was used to generate the mutations D79N FlaK, 2Cys-FlaK, and PSH D162→A; D220→A. Plasmids were transformed into BL21 DE3 cells. Cells were grown to an A600 of ∼0.6, and then protein production induced by the addition of 1 mm IPTG. Spheroplasts were made and the protein was purified as previously described (9.Li X. Dang S. Yan C. Gong X. Wang J. Shi Y. Structure of a presenilin family intramembrane aspartate protease.Nature. 2013; 493: 56-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Protein was run over Cobalt gel-filtration columns to separate out the protein from contaminants. The purity of the proteins and all mutants were examined by SEC-MALS, and also on Coomassie Blue gels. Cobalt column purified PSH was applied to partial proteolysis by endoproteinase Glu-C (V8 protease from Sigma) at room temperature for 30 min at 0.03 mg/ml. The processed protein was further purified by size exclusion chromatography. The peak fractions were pooled for functional studies. Consistent with purifications previously published results, no observable contaminants which could impair experiments was detected (7.Hu J. Xue Y. Lee S. Ha Y. The crystal structure of GXGD membrane protease FlaK.Nature. 2011; 475: 528-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The proteolytic activity of the proteins was also assessed; either by testing as previously reported, or with mammalian cell lysate (for an example, see Fig. 4). Purified PSH or FlaK protein (7.Hu J. Xue Y. Lee S. Ha Y. The crystal structure of GXGD membrane protease FlaK.Nature. 2011; 475: 528-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) (2–4 ng/ml) was added to lipid bilayers containing phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylcholine (3:1 w/w) dissolved in decane (40 mg lipid ml−1) (Avanti Polar Lipids, Alabaster, AL). All experiments were performed with 250 mm NaCl, KCl, or 50 mm CaCl2 on the cis side and 50 mm NaCl, KCl, or 10 mm CaCl2 on the trans side. All solutions had a pH of 7.35 and contained 10 mm Tris. Experiments were performed under voltage clamp conditions on a Bilayer Clamp BC-525C (Warner Instruments, Hartford, CT). Recordings were filtered at 20 kHz and digitized at 1 kHz for single channel analysis using pClamp 9.0 software (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). Open probability was determined by using current recordings from 30 s of continuously recorded data. Current amplitudes were determined by running single channel searches over at least 30 s continually recorded data, and included more than 100 channel openings per recording. All representative current traces presented were further filtered at 500 Hz and are 5 s long. For esthetic purposes, regularly timed equipment resets have been digitally removed. Murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) or LLC-PK1 cells were transfected wild type FlaK (WT FlaK) with a C-terminal His tag cloned into pCMV-ER (Invitrogen), upstream of mCherry. QuiKChange mutagenesis was used to generate D79N FlaK and 2Cys FlaK (Agilent). Cells were preincubated in Fura-2AM (5 μm with 0.1% pluronic acid and 2.5 μm probenecid, Invitrogen) and incubated in imaging buffer (in mm: 130 NaCl, 4.7 KCl, 1.2 KH2PO4, 1 MgSO4, 1.25 CaCl2 5 dextrose, and 20 HEPES, pH 7.4) at 37°. Ionomycin (5 μm) was used to empty stores in the presence of imaging buffer with the Ca2+ replaced with 1 mm EGTA and 1.25 mm MgCl2. Fura-2AM was excited with a Lamba DG4 fitted with 340/380 nm excitation filters (Sutter), and images collected with an OrcaER CCD camera (Hanamatsu) mounted on an Olympus microscope and using MetaMorph software (Molecular Devices). One-tailed unpaired Student's t test was used to determine significance with p < 0.05. As PSH and FlaK are proteases containing the same GxGD catalytic motif found in presinilin (Fig. 1A), we tested the idea that PSH and FlaK are ion channels. We started by reconstituting purified PSH protein (including the 5 stabilizing mutations that were made in the crystallized structure (9.Li X. Dang S. Yan C. Gong X. Wang J. Shi Y. Structure of a presenilin family intramembrane aspartate protease.Nature. 2013; 493: 56-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), but do not alter enzymatic activity, to enable direct comparisons with the solved structure) into a lipid bilayer. Downward deflecting currents of ∼1.5 pA at 0 mV were detected with a 250:50 mm NaCl gradient, indicating that PSH conducted Na+ (Fig. 1B). Currents were recorded over a range of voltages, with a conductance of ∼35 pS calculated for Na+ (Fig. 1C). There was no indication that PSH could conduct anions. As prokaryotic cells are very small, and do not contain an endoplasmic reticulum (ER), they do not buffer Ca2+ as efficiently as mammalian cells. Thus, they are not expected to have Ca2+ selective channels. Consistent with this, no currents were observed when the bath solution was 50:10 mm CaCl2 cis:trans, respectively, over a range of voltages. To determine if the catalytic site in PSH influences channel activity, we engineered a double AA mutation at both conserved catalytic aspartates, which has previously been demonstrated to abolish all catalytic activity (8.Torres-Arancivia C. Ross C.M. Chavez J. Assur Z. Dolios G. Mancia F. Ubarretxena-Belandia I. Identification of an archaeal presenilin-like intramembrane protease.PloS one. 2010; 5Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 9.Li X. Dang S. Yan C. Gong X. Wang J. Shi Y. Structure of a presenilin family intramembrane aspartate protease.Nature. 2013; 493: 56-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). In presenilin, the catalytically important aspartic residues are also associated with endoproteolysis, and disruption of these residues is associated with FAD (1.Wolfe M.S. Xia W. Ostaszewski B.L. Diehl T.S. Kimberly W.T. Selkoe D.J. Two transmembrane aspartates in presenilin-1 required for presenilin endoproteolysis and γ-secretase activity.Nature. 1999; 398: 513-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (1684) Google Scholar). In the bilayer, the catalytic dead mutant conducted Na+ and K+ but not Ca2+ (Fig. 1D). In the crystal structure of PSH, a “hole” comprising of helices 2 and 3 was observed (9.Li X. Dang S. Yan C. Gong X. Wang J. Shi Y. Structure of a presenilin family intramembrane aspartate protease.Nature. 2013; 493: 56-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). The “hole” spanned the distance of the bilayer, and had a diameter that would be suitable for hydrated ions (ie: greater than 2 Å) to pass through (9.Li X. Dang S. Yan C. Gong X. Wang J. Shi Y. Structure of a presenilin family intramembrane aspartate protease.Nature. 2013; 493: 56-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1E). It was previously speculated that this “hole” could constitute a channel pore (9.Li X. Dang S. Yan C. Gong X. Wang J. Shi Y. Structure of a presenilin family intramembrane aspartate protease.Nature. 2013; 493: 56-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 17.Bezprozvanny I. Presenilins and calcium signaling–systems biology to the rescue.Science Signaling. 2013; 6: pe24Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 20.Wolfe M.S. Structural biology: Membrane enzyme cuts a fine figure.Nature. 2013; 493: 34-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). It was also interesting to note that the “hole” was lined with positively charged ions, which would hinder the passage of positively charged ions such as Na+. We noted that the helices that are responsible for the “hole” are missing in another crystalized GxGD protease, FlaK. We therefore hypothesized that removal of these helices, as observed in FlaK, would be ideal to test whether a six-transmembrane GxGD protease lacking the “hole” could form a functional ion channel. To test the hypothesis that FlaK also formed an ion channel, we reconstituted purified wild type (WT) FlaK protein into a lipid bilayer. Downward deflecting currents of ∼2 pA at 0 mV were detected with a 250:50 mm NaCl gradient, indicating that WT FlaK conducted Na+ (Fig. 2A). Currents were recorded over a range of voltages to determine the ion and voltage sensitivity of the channel (Fig. 2, A and F). The channel formed by FlaK was nearly ideally cation selective, but not voltage sensitive, as found for PSH. The slope conductance for Na+ was calculated to be 85 pS, larger than PSH. The open probability of PSH at 0 mV was around 5%, and the open dwell time was around 3 ms, although examples of longer opening were also detected (Fig. 2, A–C). A similar current amplitude of 2 pA at 0 mV and a slightly higher slope conductance of 97 pS was obtained when K+ was used as a charge carrier (Fig. 2, D and F). Again, consistent with FlaK being a prokaryotic ion channel protein, no currents were observed when the bath solution was changed to 50:10 mm CaCl2 cis:trans, respectively, over the voltage range of −80 to +80 mV (Fig. 2E). Although there are no known specific inhibitors of FlaK, we used gadolinium, an ion channel blocker of transient receptor potential channels (21.Anyatonwu G.I. Ehrlich B.E. Organic cation permeation through the channel formed by polycystin-2.J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 29488-29493Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The open probability of WT FlaK at 0 mV was decreased with 10 μm Gd3+ added to the cis side of the membrane (Fig. 2G). Increasing the Gd3+ concentration to 200 μm fully inhibited all channel activity (Fig. 2H). Taken together, this suggests that WT FlaK, like PSH acts as a non-voltage, non-ligand dependent monovalent cation channel in addition to its known function as a GxGD protease. Thus, FlaK, like PSH, is a chanzyme. Moreover, the data suggest that a protein without the helices required to form the “hole” identified in crystal structures still enables the protein to form a channel. To interrogate if the channel activity of FlaK was linked to its catalytic activity, we created two mutations (Fig. 3A). The D79N mutation completely abolished protease activity (7.Hu J. Xue Y. Lee S. Ha Y. The crystal structure of GXGD membrane protease FlaK.Nature. 2011; 475: 528-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Addition of D79N FlaK to the bilayer with a Na+ gradient resulted in channel activity with higher current amplitude compared with WT FlaK, and a near doubling of the slope conductance to 195 pS (Fig. 3, B and C). The increased conductivity of Na+ in the D79N mutant is similar to the reports of increased Ca2+ conductance by mutations in holopresenilin, including the removal of the self-cleavage site of presenilin (10.Tu H. Nelson O. Bezprozvanny A. Wang Z. Lee S.F. Hao Y.H. Serneels L. De Strooper B. Yu G. Bezprozvanny I. Presenilins form ER Ca2+ leak channels, a function disrupted by familial Alzheimer's disease-linked mutations.Cell. 2006; 126: 981-993Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar). Interestingly, D79N FlaK was now Ca2+ permeable, with a slope conductance of 120 pS and current amplitude of ∼2 pA at 0 mV (Fig. 3, B and C). The permeability of D79N FlaK was Na+>K+∼Ca2+. To further test that FlaK proteolytic activity was linked to the channel activity, a second mutant, with two cysteine residues that spontaneously cross-link FlaK through α-helices 2 and 6 and has no protease activity was also examined (Fig. 3A) (7.Hu J. Xue Y. Lee S. Ha Y. The crystal structure of GXGD membrane protease FlaK.Nature. 2011; 475: 528-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In the bilayer, 2Cys FlaK was able to conduct Na+, but not Ca2+, and the activity was not enhanced by addition of the reducing agent DTT (Fig. 3, D–F), although these agents do restore catalytic activity (7.Hu J. Xue Y. Lee S. Ha Y. The crystal structure of GXGD membrane protease FlaK.Nature. 2011; 475: 528-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Addition of reducing agents did not affect WT FlaK current amplitude or single channel activity (Fig. 3G). The results obtained using the two FlaK mutants D79N and 2Cys suggest that FlaK channel activity can be separated from protease activity, but that the ion selectivity is linked to critical catalytic residues in α-helix 4, which harbors the GxGD motif. The data obtained from the PSH mutant suggest that although the catalytic site can modulate channel activity, disruption of the catalytic site is not sufficient to prevent channel activity. Taken together, the data suggest that the ion channel activity can be modulated by the catalytic properties of the protease, and that these two features are interdependent. Although planar bilayer experiments provide essential answers on the channel activity of FlaK, we wanted to confirm in a different system that the D79N FlaK mutant altered Ca2+ homeostasis. We therefore expressed FlaK and the D79N FlaK constructs in LLC-PK1 and mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). Initial experiments showed that expression of FlaK resulted in cellular death, either due to the intrinsic enzymatic activity of FlaK, or due to its monovalent cation conductance. To reduce the effect of a non-selective cation channel, we targeted FlaK to the ER and confirmed its localization and expression levels by including a C-terminal mCherry-His tag and an ER localization sequence (Fig. 4, A and B). To test if FlaK still retained intrinsic catalytic activity in a mammalian environment, we reasoned that FlaK would be capable of cutting endogenous presenilin. Consistent with our hypothesis, we found that expression of presenilin to be decreased in the FlaK transfected cells, but not in the mCherry or the D79N FlaK-transfected cells (Fig. 4C). To confirm that this was a direct effect of FlaK cutting the protein, and not of some nonspecific effect, we conducted an in vitro assay by incubating increasing amounts of purified FlaK, the same protein used for the lipid bilayer experiments, with cell lysates obtained from LLC-PK1 cells (Fig. 4D). In these experiments, we found that that the presenilin band disappeared, but another ER protein, InsP3R3 remained intact. These results confirmed that the purified FlaK used for the bilayer experiments retained its proteolytic activity, and that FlaK, when expressed in a mammalian cell also retains catalytic activity. As we had now tested the catalytic activity of FlaK and D79N FlaK, we then went on to test if Ca2+ homeostasis was altered upon expression of the D79N FlaK mutant. In mammalian cells, we found that the resting Ca2+ levels, as measured with the ratiometric Ca2+ indicator Fura 2AM, was significantly lower in D79N FlaK-transfected cells compared with either FlaK or mCherry (control)-transfected cells (Fig. 4, E and F). As our bilayer data suggested that D79N FlaK acts as a leak channel, we reasoned that the ER store concentration of Ca2+ would also be lower in the D79N FlaK-transfected cells. To test this hypothesis, we added 5 μm ionomycin (Fig. 4G), and found that the released Ca2+ from the D79N FlaK-transfected cells was significantly lower than the levels in mCherry or FlaK-transfected cells. These mammalian cell data therefore support the planar lipid bilayer results as they demonstrate that a single mutation that renders FlaK catalytically inactive also modifies Ca2+ homeostasis in mammalian cells. It has been previously reported that presenilin forms a Ca2+ channel, however, a distinguishing feature of the currents was that the amplitude was small, and they were primarily observed as an increase in membrane current noise (10.Tu H. Nelson O. Bezprozvanny A. Wang Z. Lee S.F. Hao Y.H. Serneels L. De Strooper B. Yu G. Bezprozvanny I.

In contrast, the channels formed by FlaK and PSH had larger amplitudes than the ones previously reported in presenilin (10.Tu H. Nelson O. Bezprozvanny A. Wang Z. Lee S.F. Hao Y.H. Serneels L. De Strooper B. Yu G. Bezprozvanny I.

One major difference between the proteins used in our study and presenilin, and indeed, the published PSH crystal structure (9.Li X. Dang S. Yan C. Gong X. Wang J. Shi Y. Structure of a presenilin family intramembrane aspartate protease.Nature. 2013; 493: 56-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), is that 20 amino acids (residues 182–209) on the surface were trimmed by the addition of the V8 protease. The trimmed region is analogous to the extracellular loop that is subjected to presenilinase cleavage in presenilin (exon 9, Fig. 5A). Intriguingly, for presenilin, deletion of exon 9 has been associated with a FAD causing mutation (1.Wolfe M.S. Xia W. Ostaszewski B.L. Diehl T.S. Kimberly W.T. Selkoe D.J. Two transmembrane aspartates in presenilin-1 required for presenilin endoproteolysis and γ-secretase activity.Nature. 1999; 398: 513-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (1684) Google Scholar). Moreover, disruption of exon 9 alters channel function (10.Tu H. Nelson O. Bezprozvanny A. Wang Z. Lee S.F. Hao Y.H. Serneels L. De Strooper B. Yu G. Bezprozvanny I. Presenilins form ER Ca2+ leak channels, a function disrupted by familial Alzheimer's disease-linked mutations.Cell. 2006; 126: 981-993Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar). We therefore tested to see if disruption of this loop could alter the channel activity. The protein was incubated with V8 protease, and the cleaved product purified. Remarkably, disruption resulted in the near abolition of all channel activity, from around 10% to 1% activity (Fig. 5, B and C). These results suggest that the loop is either critical for the arrangement of helices required to form the pore, or that it contributes to the pore. The published structure suggested that helices 6–9 would be required for the formation of the pore; however, both the cut and uncut versions still have enzymatic activity. Proteins are traditionally thought to have one function. For example, ion channels only conduct ions, and proteases only cut protein substrates. In this study, we have demonstrated that two GxGD proteases, PSH and FlaK, can also form monovalent cation channels. Secondly, we show that disruption of the GxGD catalytic motif (analogous to those that are associated with FAD) alters the ion selectivity of FlaK from monovalent to divalent cations, indicating that the ion channel properties and the catalytic activity are related. We propose that archeobacteria GxGD proteases, are true chanzymes, in that they have both enzymatic and ion channel properties in the same structural domain. Our data provide additional support to the suggestion that presenilin-like proteins have the capability of acting as ion channels. We demonstrate that the enzymatic activity of FlaK is inextricably linked to the ion channel activity, and both the protease and the ion channel features are essential in maintaining function of this chanzyme. Other than presenilin, only the TRPMs have been identified to act as both enzymes and ion channels (19.Montell C. Mg2+ homeostasis: the Mg2+nificent TRPM chanzymes.Curr. Biol. CB. 2003; 13: R799-801Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). However, the kinase activity of TRPM6 and TRPM7 is localized to the C terminus tail of the protein, and is largely independent of the ion channel activity. It remains to be seen whether ion channel features extend to other transmembrane proteins that are not traditionally thought to be ion channels. We speculate that these non-traditional channels could have important functional ramifications. Moreover, similar characteristics of other transmembrane membrane proteins may underlie the unresolved “leak” that is observed across cellular membranes including the plasma and ER membranes (16.Bandara S. Malmersjö S. Meyer T. Regulators of calcium homeostasis identified by inference of kinetic model parameters from live single cells perturbed by siRNA.Science Signaling. 2013; 6: ra56Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Our results show that WT and mutant PSH and FlaK conduct cations in a bilayer, and disruption of the protease activity can influence ion selectivity. Our results are in agreement with the finding that the holoform of presenilin conducts cations, and supports the presenilin leak hypothesis (10.Tu H. Nelson O. Bezprozvanny A. Wang Z. Lee S.F. Hao Y.H. Serneels L. De Strooper B. Yu G. Bezprozvanny I.

Familial Alzheimer disease-linked mutations specifically disrupt Ca2+ leak function of presenilin 1.J. Clin. Investig. 2007; 117: 1230-1239Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Our data fit with FlaK and PSH as evolutionarily earlier di-aspartyl membrane proteases that later acquired divalent cation permeability. Indeed, our results demonstrate that a single amino acid change is sufficient to alter the ion selectivity of FlaK, and the mutant FlaK can alter Ca2+ homeostasis in mammalian cells. The change in the store load of Ca2+ is comparable to published reports about leaky Ca2+ channels, for example, mutations to the ryanodine receptor that are associated with heart failure (24.Shan J. Xie W. Betzenhauser M. Reiken S. Chen B.X. Wronska A. Marks A.R. Calcium leak through ryanodine receptors leads to atrial fibrillation in 3 mouse models of catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia.Circulation Research. 2012; 111: 708-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Interestingly, we observed a near abolition of ion channel activity with the cleaved form of PSH, where residues were removed in an analogous position to the internal presenilinase site. We therefore speculate that the cleaved form of presenilin, like PSH, does not readily form an ion channel. This finding is supported by other studies that suggest that the cleaved form of presenilin acts as a dynamic modifier of either the RyR or InsP3R to modulate Ca2+ signaling (25.Cheung K.H. Mei L.

How can the secretases form a channel? One possibility is oligomerization. Supporting this idea, we superimposed the mutations in presenilin that are disease causing but not on the helices that contain the catalytic residues (Fig. 5D). The superimposition demonstrates that a number of the presenilin mutations are found in the helices that are believed to form the interface between neighboring PSH molecules. We therefore speculate that oligomerization is essential for channel activity, and alteration of this arrangement, either by presenilinase or by removal of specific residues can significantly disrupt channel activity. There is some evidence supporting oligomerization of the secretases: In the crystal structure, FlaK in a detergent mixture of Foscholine-12 and Cymal-6 was packed as a dimer with a quite large interface in one asymmetric unit (7.Hu J. Xue Y. Lee S. Ha Y. The crystal structure of GXGD membrane protease FlaK.Nature. 2011; 475: 528-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Similarly, PS1 forms homodimers, where a catalytic site can be made from two inactive presenilin monomers (35.Cervantes S. Gonzàlez-Duarte R. Marfany G.

Commun. 2006; 340: 668-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Alternatively, the crystal structures of both FlaK and PSH reveal a water filled vestibule lined by transmembrane segments 1, 2, 6, and 4, which is believed to form the area where protein substrates dock to be cleaved (7.Hu J. Xue Y. Lee S. Ha Y. The crystal structure of GXGD membrane protease FlaK.Nature. 2011; 475: 528-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the enzymatic cavity in PSH is larger than what would be necessary to permit monovalent cation permeation (7.5 Å). This large cavity suggests that it would be possible for ions to pass through in the absence of transmembrane rearrangement, which is required for substrate cleavage. Likewise, transmembrane segments 6, 7, 8, and 9 of PS1 are believed to form a similar arrangement (39.Sato C. Morohashi Y. Tomita T. Iwatsubo T. Structure of the catalytic pore of γ-secretase probed by the accessibility of substituted cysteines.J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 12081-12088Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), where transmembrane 9 of PS1 is a moveable unit, analogous to transmembrane 6 of FlaK (40.Nelson O. Supnet C. Tolia A. Horré K. De Strooper B. Bezprozvanny I. Mutagenesis mapping of the presenilin 1 calcium leak conductance pore.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 22339-22347Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Based on the arrangement of the helices in FlaK, it would be possible for small monovalent cations to pass through the cavity. However, our finding that the crosslinked 2Cys FlaK still conducted cations suggests that helices 2 and 6 may not be involved in pore formation, or that movement of these helices may not be required. The rigidity of the 2Cys FlaK mutant also limits the movement of transmembrane 4, which is critical in catalytic activity. It is possible that a single crosslink was not sufficient to block the putative pore, and that additional crosslinks are required. Our study shows that the archeobacterial proteins PSH and FlaK have dual functions as both ion channels and as proteases, the two activities are interdependent, and the apparent hole in PSH does not contribute to ion activity. We suggest that our data broadens the definition of what constitutes an ion channel, and it remains to be seen whether other transmembrane proteases also have ion channel functionality. Within the context of γ-secretases, these data provide support for all existing Ca2+-dependent hypotheses about presenilin in that GxGD protease family members are chanzymes, where they can act both as an ion channel and as a modulator of Ca2+ homeostasis via enzymatic activity.

https://openalex.org/W1966470661,"Thrombopoietin (TPO) has been implicated in the process of liver regeneration and was found to correlate with hepatic function in patients with liver disease. With this investigation we aimed to determine if perioperative TPO levels were associated with postoperative outcome in patients undergoing liver resection.Perioperative TPO was analyzed prior to liver resection as well as on the first and fifth postoperative day in 46 colorectal cancer patients with liver metastasis (mCRC) as well as 23 hepatocellular carcinoma patients (HCC). Serum markers of liver function within the first postoperative week were used to define liver dysfunction.While circulating TPO levels significantly increased one day after liver resection in patients without liver cirrhosis (mCRC) (P < 0.001), patients with underlying liver disease (HCC) failed to significantly induce TPO postoperatively. Accordingly, HCC patients had significantly lower TPO levels on POD1 and 5. Similarly, patients with major resections failed to increase circulating TPO levels. Perioperative dynamics of TPO were found to specifically predict liver dysfunction (AUC: 0.893, P < 0.001) after hepatectomy and remained an independent predictor upon multivariate analysis.We here demonstrate that perioperative TPO dynamics are associated with postoperative LD. Postoperative TPO levels were found to be lowest in high-risk patients (HCC patients undergoing major resection) but showed an independent predictive value. Thus, a dampened TPO increase after liver resection reflects a poor capacity for hepatic recovery and may help to identify patients who require close monitoring or intervention for potential complications."

In forensic research, identification of culprit BOs has been performed by trained dogs, but not by humans. We introduce the concept of nosewitness identification and present the first experimental results on BO memory in witness situations involving violent crimes. Two experiments indicated that BO associated with male characters in authentic videos could later be identified in BO lineup tests well above chance. Moreover, culprit BO in emotional crime videos could be identified considerably better than the BO of a male person in neutral videos. This indicates that nosewitness identification benefits from emotional encoding. Altogether, the study testifies to the virtue of body odor as a cue to identify individuals observed under negative emotion."
https://openalex.org/W1992479497,"Background Development of novel therapeutic drugs and regimens for cancer treatment has led to improvements in patient long-term survival. This success has, however, been accompanied by the increased occurrence of second primary cancers. Indeed, patients who received regional radiotherapy for Hodgkin’s Lymphoma (HL) or breast cancer may develop, many years later, a solid metachronous tumor in the irradiated field. Despite extensive epidemiological studies, little information is available on the genetic changes involved in the pathogenesis of these solid therapy-related neoplasms. Methods Using microsatellite markers located in 7 chromosomal regions frequently deleted in sporadic esophageal cancer, we investigated loss of heterozygosity (LOH) and microsatellite instability (MSI) in 46 paired (normal and tumor) samples. Twenty samples were of esophageal carcinoma developed in HL or breast cancer long-term survivors: 14 squamous cell carcinomas (ESCC) and 6 adenocarcinomas (EADC), while 26 samples, used as control, were of sporadic esophageal cancer (15 ESCC and 11 EADC). Results We found that, though the overall LOH frequency at the studied chromosomal regions was similar among metachronous and sporadic tumors, the latter exhibited a statistically different higher LOH frequency at 17q21.31 (p = 0.018). By stratifying for tumor histotype we observed that LOH at 3p24.1, 5q11.2 and 9p21.3 were more frequent in ESCC than in EADC suggesting a different role of the genetic determinants located nearby these regions in the development of the two esophageal cancer histotypes. Conclusions Altogether, our results strengthen the genetic diversity among ESCC and EADC whether they occurred spontaneously or after therapeutic treatments. The presence of histotype-specific alterations in esophageal carcinoma arisen in HL or breast cancer long-term survivors suggests that their transformation process, though the putative different etiological origin, may retrace sporadic ESCC and EADC carcinogenesis."

https://openalex.org/W2030883821,"Background The effectiveness and safety of bisphosphonates treatment used in the young population have not been well studied. Despite insufficient data on effectiveness and safety of bisphosphonates in young patients, bisphosphonates are still considered in younger patients at high risk for osteoporosis or fracture. The objectives of this study were to identify bisphosphonate initiators aged 10–45 years and describe their clinical characteristics and to assess time trends of bisphosphonate use over the past decade in a large U.S. population-based cohort. Methods Using the medical and pharmacy claims data from a U.S. commercial insurance (2003–2012), patients aged 10–45 years without malignancy who initiated an oral or intravenous bisphosphonate after at least 1 year of insurance enrollment were selected. Baseline demographics, comorbidities, medications and health care utilization were assessed in the year prior to initiating a bisphosphonate. The trend of bisphosphonate use over time was examined. Results There were 9,082 bisphosphonate initiators (0.02% of the same age group in the population). The mean age was 38.1 years and 79.6% female. Osteoporosis was the most common diagnosis (41.2%). At baseline, 10.8% had a diagnosis of fracture and 29.0% had a bone mineral density measured. Of those who used glucocorticoids (39%) at baseline, the mean 1-year cumulative prednisone-equivalent dose was 2,669 milligrams. The use of bisphosphonates in the young population significantly decreased over the past decade (p<0.001). Conclusions Among young patients aged 10–45, the use of bisphosphonates was uncommon and significantly decreased over the past decade in the U.S. While most patients initiating bisphosphonates had a diagnosis of osteoporosis and fracture in the preceding year, some had no recorded claims with a diagnosis of fracture, osteoporosis, or long-term glucocorticoids use at baseline. Future research is needed to examine the effectiveness and safety of bisphosphonates in young patients at risk for osteoporosis."
https://openalex.org/W2063000346,"A huge amount of information is stored in genomic DNA and this stored information resides inside the nucleus with the aid of chromosomal condensation factors. It has been reported that the repeat nucleosome core particle (NCP) consists of 147-bp of DNA and two copies of H2A, H2B, H3 and H4. Regulation of chromosomal structure is important to many processes inside the cell. In vivo, a group of histone chaperones facilitate and regulate nucleosome assembly. How NCPs are constructed with the aid of histone chaperones remains unclear. In this study, the histone chaperone-mediated nucleosome assembly process was investigated using single-molecule tethered particle motion (TPM) experiments. It was found that Asf1 is able to exert more influence than Nap1 and poly glutamate acid (PGA) on the nucleosome formation process, which highlights Asf1’s specific role in tetrasome formation. Thermodynamic parameters supported a model whereby energetically favored nucleosomal complexes compete with non-nucleosomal complexes. In addition, our kinetic findings propose the model that histone chaperones mediate nucleosome assembly along a path that leads to enthalpy-favored products with free histones as reaction substrates."

We evaluated the outcome of VOS and surveyed reasons for its low uptake in our institution.We assessed the outcomes of the VOS programme from January 2010 to December 2013 at National University Hospital, a 1081-bed tertiary hospital in Singapore. We also examined reasons for opting-in and opting-out using an interviewer-administered structured questionnaire in a representative sample in January 2013.107,523 patients fulfilled VOS criteria and were offered HIV screening, of which 5215 (4.9%) agreed to testing. 4850 (93.1%) of those who opted-in had an HIV test done. Three (0.06%) tested positive for HIV. 238 patients (14.2%) were surveyed regarding reasons for opting-in or out of VOS. 21 (8.8%) had opted-in. Patients who opted-in were likely to be younger, more educated and reported having more regular sexual partners. Type of housing, number of casual sexual partners, sexual orientation, intravenous drug use, condom use and previous sexually transmitted infection were not associated with deciding to opt-in/out. Patients' most common reasons for opting-out were: belief that they were at low risk (50.2%), belief that they were too old (26.8%), cost (6.9%) and aversion to venepuncture (6.5%). The most common reason for opting-in was desire to know their HIV status (47.6%).The success of an HIV-VOS program is largely determined by test uptake. Our study showed that the majority of eligible VOS patients opted-out of HIV screening. Given the considerable cost and low yield of this programme, more needs to be done to better equip patients in self-risk assessment and opting in to testing."

However, studies conducted so far in some African countries reported significant differences in normal laboratory ranges compared with those of the industrialized world. The aim of this study was to determine reference values of cholesterol fractions in apparently normal adults in Burkina Faso that could be used to better assess the risks related to cardiovascular diseases. Study population was 279 healthy subjects aged from 15 to 50 years including 139 men and 140 women recruited at the Regional Center of Blood Transfusion of Ouagadougou, capital city of Burkina Faso (West Africa). Exclusion criteria based on history and clinical examination were used for defining reference individuals. The dual-step precipitation of HDL cholesterol sub-fractions using dextran sulfate was performed according to the procedure described by Hirano. The medians were calculated and reference values were determined at 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles. The median and upper ranges for total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, total HDL cholesterol and HDL2 cholesterol were observed to be higher in women in comparison to men (p <0.05). These reference ranges were similar to those derived from other African countries but lower than those recorded in France and in USA. This underscores the need for such comprehensible establishment of reference values for limited resources countries. Our study provides the first cholesterol sub-fractions (HDL2 and HDL3) reference ranges for interpretation of laboratory results for cardiovascular risk management in Burkina Faso."
https://openalex.org/W2042702289,"Introduction Minor physical anomalies (MPA) are dysmorphic features that reflect deviations in early development, are morphological variants that appear during the first trimester of pregnancy and could be used as a marker of disease risk in susceptible people. The literature agrees that the number of MPA is higher in patients with schizophrenia compared with their relatives and healthy subjects. The purpose of this study is to compare the MPA, assessed using the Gourion Scale, in complete nuclear families (families with a member with schizophrenia and control families) by determining the MPA mean, concordance and heritability for the total score on the MPA Gourion Scale for each anomaly. Method The sample consisted of 60 families with at least one schizophrenic patient (284 members) and 61 control families (249 members). Results: The mean total score for the scale was 5.72 ± 2.3 MPA in the case of families with at least one schizophrenic patient and 1.8 ± 4.46 MPA for control families. The average for families of patients without considering the patient in the analysis was 5.59 ± 2.3 MPA; for patients, the mean was 6.14 ± 2.4 MPA. In the analysis by anomaly differences were found only in eleven anomalies found no evidence of heritability or concordance. Conclusions MPA occur more frequently in patients, but a pattern of low consistency between them persists. It is concluded that MPA could be a marker of neurodevelopmental problems, but it is not suitable to consider them a Gourion scale as endophenotype."
