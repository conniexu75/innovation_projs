https://openalex.org/W1977553153,A huge rubble rampart 18 kilometers long was formed at Funafuti Atoll during tropical cyclone Bebe on 21 October 1972. The material forming the rampart was derived from deeper water offshore. The formation appears to be permanent and indicates that tropical storms may play a significant role in the formation of atoll islets.
https://openalex.org/W2155373015,"The seismologically delineated transition zone, at depths between 400 and 670 kilometers, is a fundamental discontinuity in the earth that separates the upper mantle from the lower mantle. Xenoliths from within or close to the transition zone are dominated by pyropic garnet and associated pyroxene or mineralogically heterogeneous garnet lherzolite. These xenoliths show evidence for the high-pressure (90 to 120 kilobars) transformation of pyroxene to a solid solution of pyroxene in garnet (majorite) and silicon in octahedral coordination; low-pressure (less than 80 kilobars) exsolution of clinopyroxene or orthopyroxene from the original majorite is preserved. Although mineral modes and rock proportions below the transition zone and the relative amount of eclogite present cannot be accurately assessed from the xenoliths, it is likely that both majorite and beta-spinel help produce the observed seismic gradient of the transition zone."
https://openalex.org/W1969446777,"An indication of increasing /sup 14/C content of the atmosphere was found during a project of sampling atmospheric CO/sub 2/ in New Zealand in 1954. The collection of samples was continued in order to determine whether the enrichment was due to seasonal variation of C/sup 14/, or an enrichment of the atmosphere, caused by atomic explosions. The 9 samples, assayed since 1953, showed an enrichment of 7.8 percent with respect to the New Zealand wood standard of 1953. This value, correlated for industrial effect, (depletion of atmosphere C/sup 14/ due to combustion of fossil fuel), was found to be 4.8 +- 0.5 per cent of the atmosphere of the southern hemisphere. Other methods of sampling were used to verify this result. One was to expose a tray, filled with Ba(OH)/sub 2/ solution to the atmosphere; such samples showed an increase in C/sup 14/ specific activity of 4.8 +- 0.6 per cent between May 1955 and May 1957. This increase was detectable in leaves, trees, and grass from a location from which samples had been previously assayed. By using Libby's data (C.A. 50, 10522h) to estimate from the C/sup 14/ increase the total power of atomic weapons to date, the 4.8more » per cent increase for the atmosphere would account for 48 megaton of TNT equivalent of fission for the southern hemisphere and greater for the northern hemisphere, where all the atomic tests look place. From a comparison of the atmosphere C/sup 14/ specific activity with time in the 2 hemispheres, the possible rate and mechanism of mixing can be estimated.« less"
https://openalex.org/W2027927585,"Diamond anvil presses of a new design were used to compress samples of beryllium-7 oxide to 120, 210, and 270 kilobars. The decay constant for the conversion of beryllium-7 to lithium-7 by electron capture was measured for compressed and uncompressed samples. A least-squares fit of the equation (lambda(c)-lambda)/lambda = KpP to the experimental data, where lambda(C) and lambda are the decay constants of the compressed sample and an uncompressed sample, respectively, and P is pressure, yields a value of (2.2 +/- 0.1) x 10(-5) kbar(-1) for the constant K(p)."

https://openalex.org/W1996519476,"Previous simulations of a self-avoiding, closed random surface with restricted topology (without handles) on a three-dimensional lattice have shown that its behavior on long length scales is consistent with that of a branched-polymer. It is shown analytically that such a surface with an unrestricted number of handles has a qualitatively different geometry and therefore is in a different universality class. The effect of a net external pressure is to suppress the handles and collapse the surface into a branched polymer-like configuration. Topology is thus shown to be a key factor in determining the universality class of the system."

https://openalex.org/W2029658914,"Groups of scholars often behave in ways that are startlingly reminiscent of the behavior of groups of plants and animals in a biological ecosystem. I have tried to show that the parallel may have its basis in two fundamental considerations: (i) the similar properties of stable dissipative structures in a wide variety of contexts and (ii) the mathematical similarity of information to chemical (nutrient) free energy. A particularly intriguing problem is that of successional trends arising from the kinetic limitation of information flow through the intellectual and social structures created by scholars. The ""strategy of ecosystem development"" may have implications for the strategy of academic administration. In this connection, it is worth bearing in mind Marglef's dictum (6, p. 77): ""Probably the hypothesis holds everywhere that the less mature ecosystem feeds the more mature structures around it."""
