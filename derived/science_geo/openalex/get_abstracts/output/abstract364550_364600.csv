Subsequent studies provided indications that DISC1 plays a role in brain development. Here, we demonstrate that suppression of DISC1 expression reduces neural progenitor proliferation, leading to premature cell cycle exit and differentiation. Several lines of evidence suggest that DISC1 mediates this function by regulating GSK3β. First, DISC1 inhibits GSK3β activity through direct physical interaction, which reduces β-catenin phosphorylation and stabilizes β-catenin. Importantly, expression of stabilized β-catenin overrides the impairment of progenitor proliferation caused by DISC1 loss of function. Furthermore, GSK3 inhibitors normalize progenitor proliferation and behavioral defects caused by DISC1 loss of function. Together, these results implicate DISC1 in GSK3β/β-catenin signaling pathways and provide a framework for understanding how alterations in this pathway may contribute to the etiology of psychiatric disorders.

Schizophrenia is a severe brain illness that affects 0.5%–1% of the world population. While the etiology is poorly understood, accumulating evidence suggests that neurodevelopmental defects are involved (Ross et al., 2006Ross C.A. Margolis R.L. Reading S.A. Pletnikov M. Coyle J.T. Neurobiology of schizophrenia.Neuron. 2006; 52: 139-153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar). Recent studies have identified many risk genes associated with schizophrenia (International Schizophrenia Consortium, 2008International Schizophrenia ConsortiumRare chromosomal deletions and duplications increase risk of schizophrenia.Nature. 2008; 455: 237-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (1262) Google Scholar, Stefansson et al., 2008Stefansson H.

Among these genetic factors, the (1; 11) (q42; q14.3) translocation allele of the DISC1 gene closely segregates with the manifestation of psychiatric disorders in a large Scottish pedigree (Blackwood et al., 2001Blackwood D.H. Fordyce A. Walker M.T. St Clair D.M. Porteous D.J. Muir W.J. Schizophrenia and affective disorders–cosegregation with a translocation at chromosome 1q42 that directly disrupts brain-expressed genes: clinical and P300 findings in a family.Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2001; 69: 428-433Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar). Further genetic evidence from different populations has identified several SNPs in the DISC1 gene associated with schizophrenia, and multiple haplotypes and SNPs along this gene are also associated with bipolar disorder and autism spectrum disorders (Chubb et al., 2008Chubb J.E. Bradshaw N.J. Soares D.C. Porteous D.J. Millar J.K. The DISC locus in psychiatric illness.Mol. Psychiatry. 2008; 13: 36-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). These data suggest that alterations in DISC1 function play a role in the pathophysiology of these mental illnesses. Several proteins interact with DISC1, including NudE-like 1 (Ndel1), Lis1, phosphodiesterase 4B (PDE4B), and the transcription factors ATF4 and ATF5 (Chubb et al., 2008Chubb J.E. Bradshaw N.J. Soares D.C. Porteous D.J. Millar J.K. The DISC locus in psychiatric illness.Mol. Psychiatry. 2008; 13: 36-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). Functional studies revealed that DISC1 is involved in neurite outgrowth, neuronal migration, integration of newborn neurons, and cAMP signaling (Chubb et al., 2008Chubb J.E. Bradshaw N.J. Soares D.C. Porteous D.J. Millar J.K. The DISC locus in psychiatric illness.Mol. Psychiatry. 2008; 13: 36-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). However, the mechanisms by which DISC1 contributes to the wide spectrum of psychiatric disorders remain elusive. Several DISC1 transgenic mouse lines have been established to assess the effect of the human DISC1 (hDISC1) truncation on behavior. Overexpression of the DISC1 Scottish mutant (Hikida et al., 2007Hikida T. Jaaro-Peled H. Seshadri S. Oishi K. Hookway C. Kong S. Wu D. Xue R. Andrade M.

Zhou Y. Jentsch J.D. Brown R.A. Tian X. Ehninger D. Hennah W. Peltonen L. Lonnqvist J. Huttunen M.O. et al.Specific developmental disruption of disrupted-in-schizophrenia-1 function results in schizophrenia-related phenotypes in mice.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2007; 104: 18280-18285Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar) in mouse brains results in behavioral phenotypes reminiscent of schizophrenia. Likewise, point mutations in exon 2 of mouse DISC1 (mDISC1) lead to the manifestation of schizophrenia- or depression-like behaviors (Clapcote et al., 2007Clapcote S.J. Lipina T.V. Millar J.K. Mackie S. Christie S. Ogawa F. Lerch J.P. Trimble K. Uchiyama M.

Furthermore, Kvajo et al., 2008Kvajo M. McKellar H. Arguello P.A. Drew L.J. Moore H. MacDermott A.B. Karayiorgou M. Gogos J.A. A mutation in mouse Disc1 that models a schizophrenia risk allele leads to specific alterations in neuronal architecture and cognition.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2008; 105: 7076-7081Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar described a mouse mutant containing two stop codons (in exon 7 and 8), which results in the expression of a truncated transcript, that shows abnormal morphology of newborn neurons and reduced synapse number accompanied by a working memory deficit. In this study, we show that in addition to its known role in regulating neuronal functions, DISC1 is highly expressed in neural progenitor cells and is required for their proliferation. This function of DISC1 involves regulation of the β-catenin/GSK3β pathway, whereby DISC1 stabilizes β-catenin by inhibiting GSK3β activity through a direct interaction. We further narrowed down the DISC1-GSK3β interaction domain and generated a DISC1 peptide that strongly inhibits GSK3β. In the context of the adult brain, DISC1 loss of function in the dentate gyrus resulted in reduced neural progenitor proliferation and elicited hyperactive and depressive behaviors in mice. Importantly, these behavioral abnormalities were normalized by treatment with a chemical inhibitor of GSK3β. These findings provide compelling evidence that DISC1 is a central player in the GSK3β/β-catenin signaling pathway that impinges on neural progenitor proliferation. Expression of DISC1 peaks at E14-E15 in mouse embryonic brains, a period of active neurogenesis in the cortex and gradually declines as development proceeds (data not shown). In adult mice, DISC1 is robustly expressed in the dentate gyrus (DG) and olfactory bulb, two regions displaying active neurogenesis (Ma et al., 2002Ma L. Liu Y. Ky B. Shughrue P.J. Austin C.P. Morris J.A. Cloning and characterization of Disc1, the mouse ortholog of DISC1 (Disrupted-in-Schizophrenia 1).Genomics. 2002; 80: 662-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). In the embryonic cerebral cortex, we found that DISC1 was robustly expressed in nestin- and Sox2-positive neural progenitors residing in the ventricular zone (VZ)/subventricular zone (SVZ), but reduced in doublecortin (DCX)-positive neurons (Figures 1A and 1B, Figure S2A available online). DISC1 expression was reduced in the intermediate zone (IZ) but reappeared in the cortical plate (CP), consistent with its known function in postmitotic neurons (Figures 1A and 1B). The specificity of DISC1 staining was verified with embryonic mouse brains electroporated with a DISC1 short hairpin RNA construct (shRNA) (Figure S1B). On the basis of its expression in neural progenitors, we looked into a potential role for DISC1 in progenitor proliferation. To approach this, we generated two specific shRNAs that silenced endogenous DISC1 expression in adult hippocampal progenitors (AHPs) (shRNA1 and shRNA2; Figure S1A). Using lentivirus expressing control or DISC1 shRNAs, we observed that DISC1 knockdown markedly decreased cell proliferation compared to control shRNA in AHPs (Figure 1C). Moreover, DISC1 knockdown decreased BrdU labeling (2 hr pulse) by 2-fold (Figures 1D and S3A) and mitotic index by 3-fold (Figures 1E and S3B). Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis revealed that DISC1 knockdown significantly increased the proportion of cells in G0/G1 (Figure 1F). The reduction of proliferation by DISC1 knockdown prompted us to pursue the reciprocal DISC1 gain-of-function experiment. Notably, overexpression of full-length hDISC1 resulted in a 2-fold increase in cell proliferation, 2-fold increase in BrdU labeling, and 3-fold increase in mitotic index (Figure 1G–1I, S3C, and S3D). Thus, DISC1 is required for the normal proliferation of AHPs, and its overexpression promotes proliferation. We next investigated whether DISC1 regulates neural progenitor proliferation in vivo. Control or DISC1 shRNA constructs were electroporated together with a GFP-expressing vector into E13 mouse brains, and the brains were analyzed 2 days later. The positioning of GFP-positive cells revealed that DISC1 knockdown resulted in a substantial reduction of cells in the VZ/SVZ (Figure 2A), with a corresponding increase in GFP-positive cells in the CP. Therefore, DISC1 loss of function causes a depletion of cells from the proliferative VZ/SVZ. To gain insight into the mechanism accounting for the observed difference in cell positioning caused by DISC1 knockdown, we injected BrdU into the pregnant dams 2 hr prior to collection of the electroporated brains. DISC1 knockdown resulted in a marked reduction in BrdU labeling (Figure 2B) and mitotic index (Figure 2C) that could be rescued by human DISC1 cDNA (not targeted by shRNA-1) (see below), demonstrating that DISC1 is required to maintain cortical progenitor proliferation in vivo. Conversely, DISC1 overexpression increased both the percentage of cells remaining in the VZ/SVZ and the BrdU labeling index (Figure 2E). Our observations that DISC1 knockdown reduced neural progenitor proliferation and decreased positioning in the VZ/SVZ suggest that cells may be prematurely differentiating into neurons. To test this possibility, we measured the cell cycle exit index (Sanada and Tsai, 2005Sanada K. Tsai L.H. G protein betagamma subunits and AGS3 control spindle orientation and asymmetric cell fate of cerebral cortical progenitors.Cell. 2005; 122: 119-131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). E13 mouse brains were electroporated with DISC1 shRNA constructs, and BrdU was injected 2 days later at E15 into pregnant dams. At E16, brains were collected and analyzed by immunohistochemistry with anti-GFP, -BrdU, and -Ki67 antibodies (Figure 2D). We observed a 2- to 3-fold increase in cell cycle exit in DISC1 shRNA transfected embryonic brains, suggesting that the reduction of proliferating progenitors in DISC1 shRNA treated brains likely results from increased cell cycle exit. Consistent with this, a significant increase in DCX-positive cells and decrease in Sox2-positive cells was observed in DISC1 shRNA-transfected brains compared to control shRNA-transfected brains (Figures S4A and S4B). In support of the premature neuronal differentiation, we found that DISC1 knockdown in E15 brains resulted in a significantly higher proportion of Cux2- (layer 2 and 3 marker) positive cells at postnatal day 7 compared to the control. Furthermore, more control shRNA-transfected cells were found to be migrating toward layer 3 (Figure S5A). Taken together, these results suggest that DISC1 knockdown causes premature neuronal differentiation at the expense of the progenitor pool. β-catenin signaling is a conserved pathway implicated in maintenance of the stem cell pool (Lie et al., 2005Lie D.C.

The Wnt/beta-catenin pathway directs neuronal differentiation of cortical neural precursor cells.Development. 2004; 131: 2791-2801Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar), and development of the central nervous system (Schuller and Rowitch, 2007Schuller U. Rowitch D.H. Beta-catenin function is required for cerebellar morphogenesis.Brain Res. 2007; 1140: 161-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Both DISC1 and β-catenin are highly enriched in neural progenitors in the VZ. Previous reports demonstrated that ablation of β-catenin expression in the developing brain results in the depletion of neural progenitors, whereas transgenic mice expressing stabilized β-catenin exhibit a drastically expanded progenitor pool in embryonic brains (Chenn and Walsh, 2002Chenn A. Walsh C.A.

Birchmeier C. beta-Catenin signals regulate cell growth and the balance between progenitor cell expansion and differentiation in the nervous system.Dev. Biol. 2003; 258: 406-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). Thus, β-catenin and DISC1 share similar properties in regulating neural progenitors. Since β-catenin is a central downstream effector of canonical Wnt signaling, we investigated the possibility that DISC1 may modulate Wnt-mediated proliferation. The addition of Wnt3a (200 ng/ml) to culture medium significantly stimulated the proliferation of AHPs, and this increase in proliferation was abolished by DISC1 knockdown (Figure 3A). This suggests that DISC1 function converges with downstream mediators of Wnt-dependent proliferation. β-catenin exerts its function in part through nuclear translocation to stimulate the transcription of genes containing binding sites for the lymphoid enhancer factor-T cell factor (LEF/TCF) family (Gregorieff and Clevers, 2005Gregorieff A. Clevers H. Wnt signaling in the intestinal epithelium: from endoderm to cancer.Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 877-890Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar). The transcription complex containing nuclear β-catenin activates the expression of target genes important for cell proliferation (Adachi et al., 2007Adachi K. Mirzadeh Z. Sakaguchi M. Yamashita T. Nikolcheva T. Gotoh Y. Peltz G. Gong L. Kawase T. Alvarez-Buylla A. et al.Beta-catenin signaling promotes proliferation of progenitor cells in the adult mouse subventricular zone.Stem Cells. 2007; 25: 2827-2836Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Since DISC1 knockdown abrogated Wnt-dependent proliferation, we determined whether DISC1 is required for LEF/TCF activation by using a luciferase reporter construct containing eight copies of the LEF/TCF binding site (8XSuperTOPFLASH [TOP]) or mutated LEF/TCF binding sites (8XSuperFOPFLASH [FOP]) (Veeman et al., 2003Veeman M.T. Slusarski D.C. Kaykas A. Louie S.H. Moon R.T. Zebrafish prickle, a modulator of noncanonical Wnt/Fz signaling, regulates gastrulation movements.Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 680-685Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (725) Google Scholar). DISC1 knockdown significantly reduced TOP, but not FOP, reporter activity in cultures treated with Wnt3a (Figure 3B). Importantly, TOP reporter activity could be rescued by coexpression of human DISC1 cDNA with DISC1 shRNA-1 (Figure 3C). The reduction in LEF/TCF activity by DISC1 knockdown could also be recapitulated in the developing brain (Figure 3D). Furthermore, we found that DISC1 knockdown had no effect on irrelevant CRE and C/EBP-ATF reporters, confirming the specific effect on LEF/TCF activity (Figures S6A and S6B). If DISC1 loss of function attenuates Wnt signaling, then DISC1 gain of function should potentiate this signaling pathway. DISC1 overexpression increased TOP, but not FOP, reporter activity in primary neural progenitor cultures (Figure 3E) and in embryonic brains by more than 2-fold (Figure 3F). Together, these results indicate that DISC1 participates in the Wnt signaling pathway and in Wnt-mediated cell proliferation. To further decipher the mechanism by which DISC1 influences β-catenin and LEF/TCF activity, we created two β-catenin shRNAs that efficiently silenced endogenous β-catenin expression (Figure S7A). We found that the enhancement of LEF/TCF reporter activity by DISC1 overexpression was completely abolished when the expression of endogenous β-catenin was silenced (Figure 4A), indicating that the effects of DISC1 on LEF/TCF reporter activity require β-catenin. We further evaluated the effects of coexpression of WT-β-catenin, or a degradation-resistant mutant of β-catenin-S33A (SA-β-catenin), with control or DISC1 shRNAs on LEF/TCF reporter activity. We found that both WT and mutant β-catenin potentiated TOP reporter activity (Figure 4B). However, while DISC1 knockdown significantly downregulated reporter activity in WT-β-catenin expressing cells, it had no effect on SA-β-catenin-mediated reporter activation (Figure 4B). This suggests that DISC1 acts upstream of β-catenin and impacts LEF/TCF transcription by regulating β-catenin abundance. To further examine the relationship between DISC1 and β-catenin in brain development, we determined whether SA-β-catenin can rescue progenitor proliferation in vivo when DISC1 expression was silenced. As mentioned earlier, DISC1 knockdown reduced the percentage of GFP-positive cells in the VZ/SVZ, increased GFP-positive cells in the CP, and reduced BrdU labeling and the mitotic index (Figures 2A–2C). Remarkably, coexpression of SA-β-catenin with DISC1 shRNA-1 completely rescued these phenotypes (Figures 4C and 4D). This observation underscores a major role for DISC1 in regulating progenitor proliferation by modulating β-catenin levels. Increased β-catenin levels rescued the defects caused by DISC1 knockdown, suggesting that DISC1 may regulate β-catenin abundance. Indeed, we found that DISC1 shRNAs significantly decreased β-catenin levels in AHPs (Figure 5A). GSK3β regulates β-catenin stability by phosphorylating serine and threonine residues (Ser33/37 and Thr41) important for targeting β-catenin for ubiquitin-dependent proteasomal degradation (Aberle et al., 1997Aberle H. Bauer A. Stappert J. Kispert A. Kemler R. beta-catenin is a target for the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway.EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3797-3804Crossref PubMed Scopus (2158) Google Scholar). Notably, we observed that the reduction in β-catenin levels caused by DISC1 knockdown was accompanied by increases in Ser33/37 and Thr41 phosphorylation (Figure 5A) and β-catenin ubiquitination (Figure S7B). Thus, DISC1 loss of function reduces β-catenin abundance. We further evaluated the effect of DISC1 gain of function on β-catenin levels. Overexpression of WT-DISC1 reduced β-catenin S33/37/T41 phosphorylation, decreased ubiquitination, and increased total β-catenin levels in progenitors (Figures 5B and S7C). Collectively, these results suggest that DISC1 regulates β-catenin stability. If DISC1 is crucial for stabilizing β-catenin, one might predict that β-catenin transcriptional targets may be elevated by DISC1 gain of function. Cyclin D1 (Tetsu and McCormick, 1999Tetsu O. McCormick F. Beta-catenin regulates expression of cyclin D1 in colon carcinoma cells.Nature. 1999; 398: 422-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (3258) Google Scholar) and axin2 (Leung et al., 2002Leung J.Y. Kolligs F.T. Wu R. Zhai Y. Kuick R. Hanash S. Cho K.R. Fearon E.R. Activation of AXIN2 expression by beta-catenin-T cell factor. A feedback repressor pathway regulating Wnt signaling.J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21657-21665Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar) are well-established targets of β-catenin, and cyclin D1 promotes G1 progression during the cell cycle. In AHPs, cyclin D1 levels were reduced by 50% in DISC1 shRNA-1-expressing cells and by 70% in shRNA-2-expressing cells (Figure 5C). A similar decrease was observed with axin2. Conversely, cyclin D1 and axin2 expression was markedly upregulated in DISC1-overexpressing cells (Figure 5D). These data support the notion that DISC1 controls cell proliferation by regulating β-catenin abundance, thereby fine-tuning cell cycle progression. The increase in β-catenin phosphorylation caused by DISC1 knockdown raised the possibility that GSK3β activity may be directly or indirectly influenced by DISC1. Growth factors such as insulin activate AKT, which in turn phosphorylates GSK3β at Ser9, an inhibitory phosphorylation site (Cross et al., 1995Cross D.A. Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Andjelkovich M. Hemmings B.A. Inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase-3 by insulin mediated by protein kinase B.Nature. 1995; 378: 785-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (4374) Google Scholar). Furthermore, GSK3β autophosphorylates itself at Tyr216 (Lochhead et al., 2006Lochhead P.A. Kinstrie R. Sibbet G. Rawjee T. Morrice N. Cleghon V. A chaperone-dependent GSK3beta transitional intermediate mediates activation-loop autophosphorylation.Mol. Cell. 2006; 24: 627-633Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar), which is required for its activity. Upon transduction of AHPs with DISC1 shRNA lentiviruses, we observed a significant increase in Y216 phosphorylation, suggesting that DISC1 negatively impacts GSK3β activity (Figure 5E). In contrast, Ser9 phosphorylation was not affected by DISC1 knockdown (Figure 5E). Furthermore, DISC1 overexpression reduced Y216 phosphorylation (Figure 5F), further supporting the role of DISC1 in inhibition of GSK3β activity. Notably, phosphorylation of other known GSK3β substrates, Ngn2 (Ma et al., 2008Ma Y.C. Song M.R. Park J.P. Henry Ho H.Y. Hu L. Kurtev M.V. Zieg J. Ma Q. Pfaff S.L. Greenberg M.E. Regulation of motor neuron specification by phosphorylation of neurogenin 2.Neuron. 2008; 58: 65-77Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) and C/EBPα (Ross et al., 1999Ross S.E. Erickson R.L. Hemati N. MacDougald O.A. Glycogen synthase kinase 3 is an insulin-regulated C/EBPalpha kinase.Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8433-8441Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), was not affected by DISC1 shRNAs or overexpression. Thus, DISC1 selectively regulates the phosphorylation of certain GSK3β substrates. Consistent with its ability to regulate GSK3β activation, we found that DISC1 associates with GSK3β in E15 mouse embryonic brains (Figure 6A). To determine whether DISC1 and GSK3β directly bind each other and to map the region(s) of DISC1 required for the interaction, we generated GST-tagged DISC1 protein fragments and performed an in vitro association assay using purified His-tagged GSK3β (Figure 6B). Only DISC1 fragments spanning residues 1–220 and 356–595 exhibited strong interactions with GSK3β. Collectively, these results suggest that DISC1 directly interacts with GSK3β and inhibits its activity. To examine the effect of DISC1 fragments on GSK3β activity, GST-DISC1 fragments, GST-CASK fragments, or GST-p25 were incubated with purified active GSK3β in the presence of the GSK3β substrates β-catenin and axin (Thomas et al., 1999Thomas G.M. Frame S. Goedert M. Nathke I. Polakis P. Cohen P. A GSK3-binding peptide from FRAT1 selectively inhibits the GSK3-catalysed phosphorylation of axin and beta-catenin.FEBS Lett. 1999; 458: 247-251Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar) in vitro. We then analyzed the extent of GST-β-catenin phosphorylation, GST-axin phosphorylation, and GSK3β Y216 autophosphorylation. Consistent with its ability to bind GSK3β, the DISC1 fragment spanning residues 1–220 potently inhibited β-catenin, axin, and GSK3β phosphorylation at 0.5 μM, whereas none of the other DISC1 fragments, GST-p25, or GST-CASK proteins inhibited GSK3β activity at this concentration (Figure 6C). However, at higher concentrations (2 μM), DISC1 fragments spanning 221–355 and 356–595 started to inhibit GSK3β autophosphorylation (Figure S7D). This suggests that the inhibitory activity of DISC1 on GSK3β may reside on multiple domains, but that fragment 1 (1–220) possesses the most potent inhibitory activity. Furthermore, a dose response curve was established for DISC1 1–220 whereby no inhibition of GSK3β Y216 phosphorylation was observed at 0.1 μM and the inhibition of phosphorylation plateaued at 1 μM (Figure S7E). None of the GST-DISC1 fragments inhibited AKT autophosphorylation (data not shown), indicating that DISC1 is not a general kinase inhibitor. To narrow down the domain in DISC1 that inhibits GSK3β, we synthesized two peptides from mDISC1 that are highly conserved between human and mouse (Figure S8). The first peptide spanned amino acids 40–77 (Peptide-neg), and the second peptide spanned amino acids 195–238 (DISCtide-1). In vitro kinase assays demonstrated that Peptide-neg did not inhibit GSK3β at 80 μM, whereas DISCtide-1 inhibited GSK3β at 10 μM. We further found that DISCtide-1 inhibited GSK3β more potently than L803-mts, a previously described GSK3β peptide inhibitor (Plotkin et al., 2003Plotkin B. Kaidanovich O. Talior I. Eldar-Finkelman H. Insulin mimetic action of synthetic phosphorylated peptide inhibitors of glycogen synthase kinase-3.J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2003; 305: 974-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) (Figure 6D). Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) was used to determine whether DISCtide-1 directly binds to GSK3β. GSK3β SPR binding assays were carried out with mDISC1 Peptide-neg, DISCtide1, the GSK3β inhibitor L803-mts, and, as a negative control, a peptide from the N-type calcium channel, CACNA1B (Figure 6E). We found that both DISCtide1 and L803-mts bound to GSK3β (percent theoretical maximal response 197% and 259%, respectively) at a concentration of 25 μM (Figure 6E), while both Peptide-neg and the calcium channel peptide showed much lower binding (percent theoretical maximal response 62% and 29%, respectively). Interestingly, the super-stoichiometric binding exhibited by both L803-MTS and DISCtide1 (259% and 197%, respectively) suggests that both bound to GSK3β in these assays at a peptide:protein ratio of 2:1. To identify the DISCtide1 sequences that mediate this interaction with GSK3β, we designed overlapping 15-mer peptides that covered DISCtide1 and tested their binding to GSK3β by SPR (Figure 6F). One 15-mer peptide that encompasses mDISC1 amino acids 211–225, number 43 (DISCtide2), bound to GSK3β, while all other DISCtide1 15-mers showed background levels of binding (Figure 6F). Similar to DISCtide1, DISCtide2 also showed super stoichiometric binding to GSK3β in these assays with a peptide:protein ratio of 2:1 (percent maximal binding 238%). Further characterization of DISCtide2 is shown in Figure S9. Importantly, a reversed DISCtide2 sequence displayed negligible binding to GSK3β, demonstrating that the binding of DISCtide2 to GSK3β is specific.

Here, we report that the UBAN (ubiquitin binding in ABIN and NEMO) motif of NEMO selectively binds linear (head-to-tail) ubiquitin chains. Crystal structures of the UBAN motif revealed a parallel coiled-coil dimer that formed a heterotetrameric complex with two linear diubiquitin molecules. The UBAN dimer contacted all four ubiquitin moieties, and the integrity of each binding site was required for efficient NF-κB activation. Binding occurred via a surface on the proximal ubiquitin moiety and the canonical Ile44 surface on the distal one, thereby providing specificity for linear chain recognition. Residues of NEMO involved in binding linear ubiquitin chains are required for NF-κB activation by TNF-α and other agonists, providing an explanation for the detrimental effect of NEMO mutations in patients suffering from X-linked ectodermal dysplasia and immunodeficiency.

Nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB), a dimeric transcription factor formed by members of the Rel family of proteins, plays essential roles in regulating gene expression during development, skin homeostasis, and immunity. The activity of NF-κB proteins is regulated by a variety of external stimuli, including bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin-1 (IL-1) (Hayden and Ghosh, 2008Hayden M.S. Ghosh S. Shared principles in NF-kappaB signaling.Cell. 2008; 132: 344-362Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3147) Google Scholar). In the canonical pathway, NF-κB factors are retained in an inactive state by binding to the inhibitor of NF-κB (IκB), which in response to cell stimulation is ubiquitinated and degraded by the proteasome. Prior to its ubiquitination, IκB is phosphorylated by the IκB kinase (IKK) complex. The IKK complex, consisting of two kinases, IKKα and IKKβ, and the regulatory component NEMO (also known as IKKγ), is activated by an upstream kinase known as TAK1, which is in turn activated after TNF-α or IL-1 receptor stimulation (Häcker and Karin, 2006Häcker H. Karin M. Regulation and function of IKK and IKK-related kinases.Sci. STKE. 2006; 2006: re13Crossref PubMed Scopus (975) Google Scholar). Receptor-proximal events appear to initiate a specific type of ubiquitin signal, consisting of Lys63-linked ubiquitin polymers (Hayden and Ghosh, 2008Hayden M.S. Ghosh S. Shared principles in NF-kappaB signaling.Cell. 2008; 132: 344-362Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3147) Google Scholar). Attachment of Lys63-linked ubiquitin chains to receptor substrates such as RIP1 (receptor-interacting protein 1, upon TNF-α stimulation), IRAKs (IL-1 receptor-associated kinases, upon IL-1 stimulation), or TRAFs (tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factors) is critical for activation of NF-κB (Ordureau et al., 2008Ordureau A.

Chem. 2008; 283: 24295-24299Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). However, the surprising report that Ubc13-deficient mice elicit normal NF-κB activation in response to multiple stimuli (Yamamoto et al., 2006Yamamoto M. Okamoto T. Takeda K. Sato S. Sanjo H. Uematsu S. Saitoh T. Yamamoto N. Sakurai H. Ishii K.J. et al.Key function for the Ubc13 E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme in immune receptor signaling.Nat. Immunol. 2006; 7: 962-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar) has led to speculations that additional E2s could also participate in Lys63 chain production in vivo together with TRAF/IAP ligases. Alternatively, other types of ubiquitin chains could mediate activation of the NF-κB pathway. In agreement with the latter hypothesis, an E3 ligase complex, LUBAC (linear ubiquitin chain assembly complex), was recently shown to regulate the canonical NF-κB pathway independently of Lys63 chains (Kirisako et al., 2006Kirisako T. Kamei K. Murata S. Kato M. Fukumoto H. Kanie M. Sano S. Tokunaga F. Tanaka K. Iwai K.

Cell Biol. 2009; 11: 123-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar). Yet, it is mechanistically unclear how two differently linked ubiquitin polymers, Lys63 and linear ubiquitin chains, can mediate activation of the IKK complex. On the basis of the correlative evidence between linkage specificity and cellular functions, it is believed that distinct ubiquitin binding domains (UBDs) might influence the interpretation of ubiquitin signals within cells (Hurley et al., 2006Hurley J.H. Lee S. Prag G. Ubiquitin-binding domains.Biochem. J. 2006; 399: 361-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar, Ikeda and Dikic, 2008Ikeda F. Dikic I. Atypical ubiquitin chains: new molecular signals.EMBO Rep. 2008; 9: 536-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar). In the NF-κB pathway, available biochemical and genetic evidence favors a model in which the adaptor proteins TAB2/3 (TAK1 binding protein 2/3) bind to Lys63-conjugated substrates, resulting in activation of IKKα/β by its upstream kinase TAK1 (Hayden and Ghosh, 2008Hayden M.S. Ghosh S. Shared principles in NF-kappaB signaling.Cell. 2008; 132: 344-362Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3147) Google Scholar). Interestingly, several groups have identified a ubiquitin binding domain in NEMO, referred to as NUB (NEMO ubiquitin binding), CoZi (coil-zipper domain), or UBAN (ubiquitin binding in ABIN and NEMO proteins) (hereafter referred to as UBAN), which was thought to specifically bind to Lys63-ubiquitinated substrates (Wu et al., 2006Wu C.J.

Recently, Lo et al. solved a structure of the NEMO UBAN region and determined that NEMO binds significantly stronger to linear diubiquitin as compared to Lys63-linked chains (Lo et al., 2009Lo Y.-C. Lin S.-C. Rospigliosi C.C. Conze D.B. Wu C.-J. Ashwell J.D. Eliezer D. Wu H. Structural basis for recognition of diubiquitins by NEMO.Mol. Cell. 2009; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.molcel.2009.01.012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Yet, detailed information how NEMO might distinguish linear from Lys63-linked chains and the importance of this binding event for signaling has been lacking. Here, we provide structural and functional evidence that the UBAN motif of NEMO binds to linear ubiquitin chains, and that this interaction plays a crucial role in TNF-α-induced activation of the IKK complex and NF-κB, but not MAPK pathways in vivo. Several groups have previously shown that the coiled-coil 2 (CC2) and leucine zipper (LZ) region (abbreviated as CoZi region) is the fragment in NEMO necessary for binding to ubiquitin chains (Ea et al., 2006Ea C.K. Deng L. Xia Z.P. Pineda G. Chen Z.J. Activation of IKK by TNFα requires site-specific ubiquitination of RIP1 and polyubiquitin binding by NEMO.Mol.

The CoZi region contains the centrally located UBAN motif (Figure S1A available online), a conserved domain also present in other ubiquitin binding proteins including the ABINs and optineurin (Zhu et al., 2007Zhu G. Wu C.J. Zhao Y. Ashwell J.D. Optineurin negatively regulates TNFalpha- induced NF-kappaB activation by competing with NEMO for ubiquitinated RIP.Curr.

This fragment was further used to assess NEMO binding to different types of ubiquitin chains in vitro. After confirming that the UBAN motif binds to linear, i.e., head-to-tail linked, tetraubiquitin constructs used in previous studies (Bloor et al., 2008Bloor S. Ryzhakov G. Wagner S. Butler P.J. Smith D.L. Krumbach R. Dikic I. Randow F. Signal processing by its coil zipper domain activates IKKγ.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Dikic I. et al.Ubiquitin binding mediates the NF-кB inhibitory potential of ABIN proteins.Oncogene. 2008; 27: 3739-3745Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), we next compared its ability to interact with different diubiquitin molecules. Interestingly, we found that the UBAN motif could bind linear diubiquitin, but failed to interact with diubiquitin molecules linked via Lys48 or Lys63 obtained from two independent sources (Figures 1A, S1B, and S1C). Similar results were acquired for the UBAN motif of ABIN1 (Figure 1A). These observations are clearly distinct from the NZF domain of HDAC6 (Boyault et al., 2006Boyault C. Gilquin B. Zhang Y. Rybin V. Garman E. Meyer-Klaucke W. Matthias P. Müller C.W. Khochbin S. HDAC6-p97/VCP controlled polyubiquitin chain turnover.EMBO J. 2006; 25: 3357-3366Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar), the UBM of Polι (Bienko et al., 2005Bienko M. Green C.M. Crosetto N. Rudolf F. Zapart G. Coull B. Kannouche P. Wider G. Peter M. Lehmann A.R. et al.Ubiquitin-binding domains in Y-family polymerases regulate translesion synthesis.Science. 2005; 310: 1821-1824Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar), and the UBA domain of hRad23A, which bind to all diubiquitin chains (linear, Lys63, and Lys48) (Figure 1A). Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) experiments confirmed that the NEMO UBAN motif bound linear diubiquitin molecules with a dissociation constant of 1.6 μM, while binding to Lys63 or Lys48 diubiquitin molecules was below the detection level up to around 5 μM of diubiquitin (Figure 1B). A challenging task in the ubiquitin field is to understand the specificity of UBD binding to particular ubiquitin chain types. Multiple structures of UBDs in complex with monoubiquitin have been published (reviewed in Hurley et al., 2006Hurley J.H. Lee S. Prag G. Ubiquitin-binding domains.Biochem. J. 2006; 399: 361-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar), but to date no structural information exists concerning the recognition of ubiquitin chains by UBDs. In order to investigate the binding of linear diubiquitin to the UBAN motif, we first determined the structure of the NEMOCoZi region alone at 2.8 Å resolution (Table S1). NEMOCoZi forms a parallel coiled-coil homodimer with an overall length of 120 Å (Figure 2A), showing a typical coiled-coil arrangement with “a” and “d” positions occupied mostly by hydrophobic residues. The region between residues 288 and 290 induces a phase shift in the heptad periodicity of the coiled coil (Figure S2), but it remains α-helical with interprotomer coiled-coil interactions, resulting in a continuous two-helix bundle. Pro292 induces a kink in the overall helical structure, which gives rise to a deviation from a perfect two-fold symmetry (Figure 2B). However, when the structure is separated into N-terminal (260 to 291) and C-terminal (293 to 330) fragments, each subdomain displays an approximate dyad symmetry around the coiled-coil axes, so that the Cα atoms of the two protomer subdomains can be superimposed with RMS deviations of 0.88 Å and 0.92 Å, respectively (Figure 2B). This two-fold symmetry of the C-terminal fragment results in similar electrostatic surface potential landscapes on both sides of the coiled coil (Figure 2C). To gain further insight into the mechanism of NEMO binding to linear chains, we cocrystallized NEMOCoZi with linear diubiquitin. Depending on their position relative to the substrate, the ubiquitin monomers in ubiquitin chains can be described as distal or proximal subunits, with the proximal ubiquitin having a free C terminus in an unattached chain. We will refer to the N- and C-terminal ubiquitin moieties of the linear diubiquitin used in this study as Ubdistal and Ubproximal, respectively. The structure of NEMOCoZi in complex with linear diubiquitin was determined at 2.7 Å resolution (Table S1). Each asymmetric unit of the C2 lattice contains one complex in which NEMOCoZi dimer and diubiquitin are present with a 1:2 stoichiometry. As expected from the pseudo-two-fold symmetry of the homodimeric structure of NEMOCoZi alone, the NEMO dimer accommodates two diubiquitin molecules, one on either side of the coiled coil (Figures 3A and 3B). Both NEMO protomers contribute to each of the diubiquitin binding surfaces, which are comprised of residues Glu289 to Glu320. Importantly, we have obtained an essentially identical structure of the NEMOCoZi●diubiquitin complex from an independent crystal form with a different space group (P212121). Upon binding to NEMO, the two diubiquitin molecules adopt highly similar conformations (RMS deviation of 1.17 Å for the Cα positions of residues 1–146), submerging almost identical solvent-accessible surface areas (1057 Å2 and 1070 Å2). However, the distal and proximal ubiquitin moieties bind NEMO in a remarkably divergent fashion (Figures 3C–3J). The Ubdistal contacts NEMO using its C-terminal tail together with the canonical hydrophobic Ile44 surface (Figures 3C and 3D), whereas the Ubproximal employs residues located adjacent to, but not overlapping with, the Ile44 patch (Figures 3C–3F and S3A). The latter interaction involves residues Gln2, Phe4, Lys6, Gly10, Thr12, Ile13, Thr14, Glu16, Glu64, and Thr66 in the Ubproximal, which engage mainly in polar interactions with residues Arg309, Arg312, Glu313, Glu317, and Glu320 from one of the two NEMO protomers (Figures 3C–3F, 3I, 3J, and S3A). This mode of ubiquitin binding has not been observed for any other UBDs studied (Hurley et al., 2006Hurley J.H. Lee S. Prag G. Ubiquitin-binding domains.Biochem. J. 2006; 399: 361-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar). The electron density map for the contacting residues from NEMO UBAN, Ubproximal, and Ubdistal, contoured at 1.0 Å, is shown in Figures S3B and S3C. On the Ubdistal, the UBAN motif of NEMO recognizes the canonical hydrophobic patch surrounding Ile44 (Figure 3C). Although the interactions are mainly hydrophobic, salt bridges and hydrogen bonds also contribute to binding. The electrostatic interactions are centered on Asp304 of NEMO, making a salt bridge with Arg72, in addition to hydrogen bonds formed with the backbone amides of Leu73 and Arg74 of Ubdistal (Figures 3G and 3H). Notably, Leu73 and Arg74 are the only residues of Ubdistal that bind both chains of NEMO simultaneously (Figures 3G–3J). In contrast, the last two C-terminal residues of Ubdistal, Gly75 and Gly76, protrude away from the UBAN neighborhood and are not involved in NEMO binding. In order to test whether the aforementioned linkage region between the two ubiquitins contributes to NEMO binding, we generated mutations in Arg72, Leu73, and Arg74 of only the distal ubiquitin in a GST-diubiquitin. The resulting GST-Ub (R72A,L73A,R74A)-Ub was impaired in binding to NEMO compared to wild-type GST-diubiquitin (Figure S3D). Similarly mutation of Gln2 in proximal ubiquitin [GST-Ub-Ub(Q2A)] also impaired binding to NEMO in GST pull-down assays (Figure S3D). These findings confirm that both ubiquitin moieties in diubiquitin are essential for binding to the continuous binding surface on the UBAN dimer. Superimposition of the free and diubiquitin-bound structures revealed distinct conformational changes of NEMOCoZi upon diubiquitin binding, as indicated by an overall RMS deviation of 2.71 Å for the Cα atoms of the two NEMOCoZi structures (Figures 4A and 4B). Diubiquitin binding induces a slight unwinding of the coiled coil, which is best seen in a side view of NEMOCoZi (Figure 4C). As a result of this, the half pitch of the coiled-coil superhelix increases by 12 Å in length from 67 Å, encompassing residues 284–328, to 79 Å with residues 282–334. In addition, the aforementioned kink in NEMO caused by Pro292 is ameliorated by the interaction of Pro292 and Glu289 in NEMO with Gly47 and His68 of the Ubdistal, respectively. Ubiquitin binding consequently causes a straightening of each of the helices of the NEMO UBAN coiled coil (Figure 4C). These structural adjustments of CoZi upon ubiquitin binding may potentially extend throughout the molecule and may alter the interaction of NEMO with the catalytic subunits of the IKK complex, which could have implications for the activation of NF-κB. The residues of the UBAN motif found in contact with ubiquitin in the crystal structures were subsequently analyzed for their contribution to ubiquitin binding in the context of full-length NEMO. In agreement with our structural data, mutating the residues in the UBAN motif that electrostatically interact with either Ubproximal (i.e., Arg309, Arg312, Glu313, Glu 317, and Glu 320) or Ubdistal (i.e., Val293, Tyr301, Lys302, and Phe305) abolished the binding to linear diubiquitin (Figure 5A). Similar results were obtained by analysis of a bacterially expressed and purified CoZi fragment containing the UBAN motif for binding to linear di- or tetraubiquitin chains (Figure 5B). In contrast, the purified CoZi fragment bound Lys63-linked ubiquitin chains only if they were above a certain minimal length, i.e., tetraubiquitin but not diubiquitin. Furthermore, binding to Lys63-linked tetraubiquitin chains was not dependent on the Arg309, Arg312, and Glu313 surface, but was instead abrogated upon mutation of Val293/Tyr301/Lys302 or Phe305 (Figures 5B and S4A). In order to further evaluate tetraubiquitin binding to NEMO, we mixed linear and Lys63 chains and performed in vitro competition assays for binding to the CoZi fragment of NEMO. In these assays, NEMO bound exclusively to linear chains as compared to Lys63 tetraubiquitin chains (Figure 5C), indicating a preferential role of NEMO binding to linear chains even in the presence of Lys63 chains. Moreover, mutational analysis indicates that NEMO interacts with linear and Lys63-linked tetraubiquitin chains in a qualitatively different manner (Figure 5B). The differences in binding to linear versus Lys63-linked chains, in particular the dependence of linear chains binding to the Ubproximal patch, allowed us to test whether binding of linear or Lys63-linked ubiquitin chains to NEMO is essential for activation of NF-κB in vivo. Numerous studies have indicated an essential role of NEMO in linking TNF-α signaling pathways to activation of NF-κB- and MAPK-related pathways (Yamamoto et al., 2006Yamamoto M. Okamoto T. Takeda K. Sato S. Sanjo H. Uematsu S. Saitoh T. Yamamoto N. Sakurai H. Ishii K.J. et al.Key function for the Ubc13 E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme in immune receptor signaling.Nat.

Essential cytoplasmic translocation of a cytokine receptor-assembled signaling complex.Science. 2008; 321: 663-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). To further analyze the role of ubiquitin binding to NEMO for NF-κB signaling in vivo, we utilized mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) derived from NEMO knockout mice (KO-NEMO). Similar to the wild-type MEFs, TNF-α induced rapid phosphorylation and subsequent degradation of IκBα in NEMO-deficient MEFs reconstituted with NEMO, but not in NEMO-deficient MEFs expressing NEMO-V293A,Y301A,K302A or NEMO-R309A,R312A,E313A, i.e., mutants incapable of binding linear ubiquitin chains (Figure 5D). Moreover, comparable inhibition was observed in MEF cells reconstituted with single amino acid mutations in the distal (Phe305) patch of NEMO and partial inhibition in the proximal (Glu313) patch of NEMO in response to TNF-α (Figure S4B). In contrast, TNF-α stimulated phosphorylation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38MAPK) and Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) to equivalent levels in wild-type MEFs and MEFs reconstituted with NEMO as well as the ubiquitin-binding deficient NEMO mutants (Figure 5D). These findings indicate that NF-κB, but not other TNF-α-stimulated pathways, is impaired in the tested cells. Since TNF-α under different conditions can mediate either cell survival or apoptosis, presumably via changes in the level of NF-κB and JNK activities (Chang et al., 2006Chang L. Kamata H. Solinas G. Luo J.L. Maeda S. Venuprasad K. Liu Y.C. Karin M.

TNF-α-induced apoptosis was clearly more pronounced in NEMO knockout MEFs and in cells reconstituted with NEMO mutants deficient in ubiquitin binding, as compared with wild-type MEFs or MEFs reconstituted with wild-type NEMO (Figure 5F). In addition, we also utilized NEMO-deficient F40 B cells (Bloor et al., 2008Bloor S. Ryzhakov G. Wagner S. Butler P.J. Smith D.L. Krumbach R. Dikic I. Randow F.

F40 cells transduced with wild-type NEMO showed strong activation of NF-κB in response to treatment with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), IL-1, CpG DNA, or PMA/ionomycin (Figure 6A). In contrast, cells complemented with NEMO mutants selectively defective in binding to Ubdistal (NEMO-V293A,Y301A,K302A, and NEMO-F305A) or Ubproximal (NEMO-R309A,R312A,E313A), all failed to activate NF-κB, similar to the previously described NEMO-D304N and NEMO-E308V alleles. Thus, we can conclude that binding of both Ubdistal and Ubproximal monomers is essential for agonist-induced NF-κB activation. Subsequently, we introduced NEMO alleles into wild-type B cells in order to favor the assembly of NEMO heterodimers consisting of wild-type and mutant proteins (Figure 6B). Depending on the mutant allele, heterodimers with defects in only one of the four ubiquitin interaction sites could thereby be created. NEMO alleles deficient in binding either the proximal or the distal ubiquitin evidently interfered with LPS-induced signaling in a dominant-negative fashion, which implies that a defect in even one of the four ubiquitin binding sites prevents signaling. We suggest that, while dual anchoring of individual linear ubiquitin chains by NEMO would strengthen binding, double-sided binding of two ubiquitin chains may help to assemble supramolecular signaling complexes. Such activity could explain why NEMO serves as a hub in NF-κB signaling cascades. The significance of ubiquitin-mediated events for the activation of the canonical NF-κB pathway has been well established, but the mechanism of ubiquitin-dependent signal transmission remains less well defined. The discovery of ubiquitin-binding modules in components of the NF-κB pathway, such as CUE and NZF domains in TAB2/3 (Kanayama et al., 2004Kanayama A. Seth R.B. Sun L. Ea C.K. Hong M. Shaito A.

Stem cells are characterized by their unique abilities to both self-renew and differentiate to produce all mature cell lineages of a given tissue type. In the adult vertebrate, HSCs reside in the bone marrow (BM), while during embryonic development several sites successively become competent to produce HSCs (Orkin and Zon, 2008Orkin S.H. Zon L.I. Hematopoiesis: an evolving paradigm for stem cell biology.Cell. 2008; 132: 631-644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1517) Google Scholar). An understanding of the complex network of inductive signals regulating HSC development is of significant therapeutic interest for HSC maintenance in the adult. The aorta-gonad-mesonephros (AGM) region contains the first adult-type long-term repopulating (LTR-) HSCs in the vertebrate embryo; murine transplantation studies revealed that LTR-HSCs can be found on the ventral wall of the dorsal aorta by e10.5. The Runx1 protein, widely known for its involvement in leukemia, is specifically expressed in the AGM and is required for the formation of functional HSCs (North et al., 2002North T.E. de Bruijn M.F. Stacy T. Talebian L. Lind E. Robin C. Binder M. Dzierzak E. Speck N.A.

The expression of Runx1 is highly conserved across vertebrate species (Orkin and Zon, 2008Orkin S.H. Zon L.I. Hematopoiesis: an evolving paradigm for stem cell biology.Cell. 2008; 132: 631-644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1517) Google Scholar). We recently showed that PGE2 regulates vertebrate HSC induction and engraftment (North et al., 2007North T.E. Goessling W. Walkley C.R. Lengerke C. Kopani K.R. Lord A.M. Weber G.J. Bowman T.V. Jang I.H. Grosser T. et al.Prostaglandin E2 regulates vertebrate haematopoietic stem cell homeostasis.Nature. 2007; 447: 1007-1011Crossref PubMed Scopus (822) Google Scholar). PGE2 was identified through a chemical genetic screen for modifiers of runx1 expression within the zebrafish AGM. A stabilized derivative, 16,16-dimethyl-PGE2 (dmPGE2), enhanced the formation of stem cells and zebrafish marrow recovery following irradiation injury. dmPGE2 significantly increased ES cell hematopoietic colony formation and the frequency of both short (ST-) and LTR-HSCs in the mouse BM. The exact mechanism by which PGE2 exerts its effects on HSCs remains unknown. PGE2 has a regulatory role during myeloid differentiation, erythropoiesis and stromal cell homeostasis in murine BM (Fisher and Hagiwara, 1984Fisher J.W. Hagiwara M.

Additionally, hematopoietic lineage regeneration is impaired in cyclooxygenase (Cox) 2-deficient mice (Lorenz et al., 1999Lorenz M. Slaughter H.S. Wescott D.M. Carter S.I. Schnyder B. Dinchuk J.E.

Together, these data indicate that PGE2 plays a critical role in HSC induction as well as maintenance and function in the adult organism. Wnt signaling has been similarly implicated in HSC regulation in the adult BM (Reya et al., 2003Reya T. Duncan A.W. Ailles L. Domen J. Scherer D.C. Willert K. Hintz L. Nusse R. Weissman I.L.

To date, however, a role for wnt in HSC development has not been described. Wnt signaling regulates several aspects of vertebrate embryogenesis, including gastrulation, somitogenesis and organogenesis (Goessling et al., 2008Goessling W. North T.E. Lord A.M. Ceol C. Lee S.

We hypothesized that wnt likely functions as a major regulator of stem cell induction during embryogenesis, and may work in conjunction with PGE2 in HSC formation and hematopoietic regeneration. Clinical evidence supported the purported interaction between PGE2 and Wnt signaling in vivo. Patients with mutations in the Adenomatous Polyposis Coli (APC) gene, a critical intracellular regulator of wnt signaling, typically develop innumerable colonic polyps and ultimately colon cancer. Treatment with COX inhibitors significantly reduces polyp formation (Giardiello et al., 1993Giardiello F.M. Hamilton S.R. Krush A.J. Piantadosi S. Hylind L.M. Celano P. Booker S.V. Robinson C.R.

This observation was confirmed by chemical Cox inhibition in APCMin mice (Boolbol et al., 1996Boolbol S.K. Dannenberg A.J. Chadburn A. Martucci C. Guo X.J. Ramonetti J.T. Abreu-Goris M. Newmark H.L.

The connection between Wnt and PGE2 has been mechanistically described in cellular proliferation and oncogenesis (Castellone et al., 2005Castellone M.D. Teramoto H. Williams B.O. Druey K.M. Gutkind J.S. Prostaglandin E2 promotes colon cancer cell growth through a Gs-axin-beta-catenin signaling axis.Science. 2005; 310: 1504-1510Crossref PubMed Scopus (735) Google Scholar, Shao et al., 2005Shao J.

Chem. 2005; 280: 26565-26572Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). However, these studies are limited to in vitro analyses using immortalized cell lines, which often harbor mutations in the wnt pathway itself. As such, they cannot address whether this interaction is functionally relevant in vivo or if it is solely an aberrant regulatory mechanism utilized in carcinogenesis (Buchanan and DuBois, 2006Buchanan F.G. DuBois R.N. Connecting COX-2 and Wnt in cancer.Cancer Cell. 2006; 9: 6-8Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, Clevers, 2006Clevers H. Colon cancer–understanding how NSAIDs work.N. Engl. J. Med. 2006; 354: 761-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Here we show that PGE2 can directly regulate wnt activity in vivo during vertebrate development and organ regeneration. This interaction occurs within HSCs and the hematopoietic niche during embryogenesis and functions to regulate HSC induction. PGE2 was required to mediate the effects of wnt activation and can act to further amplify wnt activity through cAMP/PKA-mediated regulation of β-catenin protein stability in vivo. Both in vitro, in murine ES cell hematopoietic assays, and in vivo following BM transplantation, PGE2 modified wnt-mediated regulation of hematopoietic stem and progenitor populations. Significantly, this role of PGE2 was conserved during regeneration in several organ systems, indicating that the PGE2/wnt interaction serves as a master regulator of vertebrate organ regeneration. Clinical evidence from colon cancer patients and cancer cell lines suggested a close association between the wnt and PGE2 pathways (Castellone et al., 2005Castellone M.D. Teramoto H. Williams B.O.

To examine whether PGE2 regulates wnt activity in vivo, we utilized TOP:dGFP β-catenin-responsive reporter zebrafish embryos. 10 μM dmPGE2 caused a striking increase in reporter activity throughout the embryo at 36 hr postfertilization (hpf; 99 increased [inc]/111 scored). Specifically, it quadrupled the number of GFP+ cells in the AGM (12 ± 3.4 (dmPGE2) versus 3 ± 1.8 (control [con]) cells, p < 0.05; Figures 1A, 1B, and 1D). We previously showed by mass spectroscopy that the non-selective cox inhibitor indomethacin (indo) suppressed PGE2 production in zebrafish embryos (North et al., 2007North T.E. Goessling W. Walkley C.R. Lengerke C. Kopani K.R. Lord A.M. Weber G.J. Bowman T.V. Jang I.H. Grosser T. et al.Prostaglandin E2 regulates vertebrate haematopoietic stem cell homeostasis.Nature. 2007; 447: 1007-1011Crossref PubMed Scopus (822) Google Scholar). 10 μM indo decreased GFP expression globally and abolished wnt activity within the AGM (72 decreased [dec]/87, 0.7 ± 0.5 cells, p < 0.05; Figures 1C and 1D). qPCR analysis for GFP confirmed that PGE2 significantly modulates wnt activity in vivo (p < 0.05; Figure 1E). To determine whether wnt activity was localized within the HSCs, we examined TOP:dGFP embryos coexpressing lmo2:dsRed, which label both HSCs and endothelial cells. wnt activity in wild-type (WT) embryos was found in the endothelial and subendothelial layers of the ventral wall of the dorsal aorta (Figure 1F), which possess HSC potential in murine transplantation assays (North et al., 2002North T.E. de Bruijn M.F. Stacy T. Talebian L. Lind E. Robin C. Binder M. Dzierzak E. Speck N.A. Runx1 expression marks long-term repopulating hematopoietic stem cells in the midgestation mouse embryo.Immunity. 2002; 16: 661-672Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). dmPGE2 enhanced wnt activity within the HSC/endothelial population and in the subendothelial layer (Figure 1G). Indo decreased wnt-active cells in the AGM (Figure 1H). FACS analysis of bigenic fish showed that dmPGE2 significantly enhanced lmo2+ (p < 0.05; Figures S2A and S2C available online) and GFP+ wnt-active cells (Figures 1I, 1J, and S2B); wnt activation was most pronounced within the lmo2+ fraction (Figure S2D). Indo significantly diminished wnt-active and lmo2+ cells (p < 0.05; Figures 1K and S2A–S2E). Together, these data demonstrate that PGE2 regulates wnt activity within the HSC/endothelial cell population as well as the hematopoietic niche during embryonic development. The role of wnt signaling in regulating embryonic HSC formation has not been determined. Using inducible wnt8 transgenic zebrafish, we previously studied the time-dependent effects of wnt activation on organ formation (Goessling et al., 2008Goessling W. North T.E. Lord A.M. Ceol C. Lee S. Weidinger G. Bourque C. Strijbosch R. Haramis A.P. Puder M. et al.APC mutant zebrafish uncover a changing temporal requirement for wnt signaling in liver development.Dev. Biol. 2008; 320: 161-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Here, we examined alterations in the expression of the conserved HSC markers runx1/cmyb at 36 hpf (North et al., 2007North T.E. Goessling W. Walkley C.R. Lengerke C. Kopani K.R. Lord A.M. Weber G.J. Bowman T.V. Jang I.H. Grosser T. et al.Prostaglandin E2 regulates vertebrate haematopoietic stem cell homeostasis.Nature. 2007; 447: 1007-1011Crossref PubMed Scopus (822) Google Scholar). Transplantation of FACS-fractionated murine AGM cells demonstrated that all HSCs express Runx1 (North et al., 2002North T.E. de Bruijn M.F. Stacy T. Talebian L. Lind E. Robin C. Binder M. Dzierzak E. Speck N.A. Runx1 expression marks long-term repopulating hematopoietic stem cells in the midgestation mouse embryo.Immunity. 2002; 16: 661-672Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar); similarly, in zebrafish, AGM cells from subdissected tail regions, encompassing the runx1+ population, possess LTR-HSC activity, indicating HSC function with in the AGM is conserved (T.E.N. and L.I.Z., unpublished data). We found that induction of wnt8 during mid-somitogenesis enhanced runx1/cmyb+ cells (47 inc/54; Figures 2A and 2C). To examine whether PGE2 was required to mediate the effects of wnt activation on HSCs, wnt8 induction was followed by indo exposure; this reduced HSC number to WT levels (43 normal [norm]/46; Figures 2B and 2D). These findings were confirmed by qPCR for runx1 and cmyb (Figures S3A and S3B) and demonstrate that PGE2 is required for wnt-mediated regulation of HSC formation in vivo. Significantly, wnt activation synergized with PGE2 in the majority of embryos (25 inc/41; Figures S3F–S3J) examined, demonstrating that PGE2 can function to enhance wnt activity in vivo. To genetically localize the interaction between PGE2 and the wnt pathway, transgenic fish expressing inducible negative regulators of wnt signaling were exposed to dmPGE2. Dickkopf (dkk), a membrane-level antagonist, inhibited runx1/cmyb expression (34 dec/49; Figures 2E and 2G). This effect could be rescued by exposure to dmPGE2 (28 norm/51; Figures 2F and 2H). Axin, a central component of the β-catenin destruction complex, and a dominant-negative form of the β-catenin transcriptional coactivator T cell factor (TCF) also severely diminished HSC formation (47 dec/52 [axin]; 60 dec/62 [TCF]; Figures 2I and 2K). However, these effects could not be overcome by dmPGE2 treatment (40 dec/45; 48 dec/51; Figures 2J and 2L). These results were confirmed by qPCR for runx1 and cmyb (Figures S3A and S3B). Expression of vascular markers flk1 and ephB2 (Figures S3C and S3D) and the wnt target cyclin D1 (Figures S3E) were coordinately affected by the PGE2/wnt interaction. These experiments indicate that PGE2 interacts with the wnt pathway at the level of β-catenin destruction to control HSC formation. To demonstrate a direct effect of the PGE2/wnt interaction on HSC number rather than gene expression alone, inducible wnt transgenics were crossed to cmyb:GFP HSC reporter zebrafish (North et al., 2007North T.E. Goessling W. Walkley C.R. Lengerke C. Kopani K.R. Lord A.M. Weber G.J. Bowman T.V. Jang I.H. Grosser T. et al.Prostaglandin E2 regulates vertebrate haematopoietic stem cell homeostasis.Nature. 2007; 447: 1007-1011Crossref PubMed Scopus (822) Google Scholar). In vivo confocal microscopy (Figures 2M and 2N) revealed that indo caused a significant decrease in HSC number (1.8 ± 0.8 versus 11.4 ± 3.2 [con], p < 0.001; Figures 2O and 2Z). wnt8 significantly increased HSCs (20.6 ± 3.2, p < 0.001; Figure 2P), while subsequent indo treatment returned HSC numbers to near WT levels (11.8 ± 1.6; Figure 2Q). dmPGE2 enhanced HSC number, as previously shown (North et al., 2007North T.E. Goessling W. Walkley C.R. Lengerke C. Kopani K.R. Lord A.M. Weber G.J. Bowman T.V. Jang I.H. Grosser T. et al.Prostaglandin E2 regulates vertebrate haematopoietic stem cell homeostasis.Nature. 2007; 447: 1007-1011Crossref PubMed Scopus (822) Google Scholar) (20.8 ± 1.9, p < 0.001; Figures 2R and 2S). dkk (2.6 ± 0.9, p < 0.001; Figure 2T), axin (3.0 ± 1.0, p < 0.001, Figure 2V), and dnTCF (1.4 ± 0.6, p < 0.001; Figure 2X) diminished HSCs. dmPGE2 could only rescue the effects of dkk, not of axin or dnTCF (9.8 ± 0.8; 3.4 ± 1.3; 1.4 ± 0.9; Figures 2U, 2W, and 2Y). These results demonstrate that PGE2 and wnt signaling interact at the level of the β-catenin destruction complex and influence HSC number in the AGM. To further delineate the impact of the PGE2/wnt interaction on developing HSCs, we examined apoptosis and cellular proliferation. During embryonic development only a small fraction of AGM cells appeared TUNEL+ (Figures 3A, 3B, S4A, and S4E); cell counts in a defined anatomical section of the trunk revealed 5.6 ± 1.8 apoptotic cells in untreated WT embryos. wnt8 (3.6 ± 1.1; Figures S4C) or dmPGE2 (1.8 ± 1.5; Figures S4F) decreased TUNEL+ cells. Indo induced wide-spread apoptosis (40.8 ± 4.6, p < 0.001; Figures S4B) and counteracted the effect of wnt8 (11.6 ± 2.4; p < 0.001; Figures S4D). Similarly, dkk, axin, or dnTCF induction increased apoptosis in the AGM (43.2 ± 8.2; 33.2 ± 4.9; 34.6 ± 5.6; p < 0.001 versus con; Figures 3B, S4G, S4I, and S4K), which was improved by dmPGE2 only in dkk embryos (9.2 ± 2.8, p < 0.001 versus dkk; Figures S4H, S4J, and S4L). BrdU incorporation occurred globally during embryonic development, including cells within the AGM region (10.4 ± 2.1; Figures 3C, 3D, S4M, and S4Q); this effect was significantly enhanced by wnt8 (24.4 ± 5.0; p < 0.001; Figures S4O) and dmPGE2 (27.8 ± 3.0, p < 0.001; Figures S4R). Indo suppressed BrdU incorporation (2.8 ± 1.5, p < 0.002; Figures S4N) and blunted the proliferative effect of wnt activation (7.2 ± 2.6, p < 0.001 versus wnt8; Figures S4P). dkk, axin, or dnTCF similarly decreased BrdU incorporation (4.6 ± 2.0; 5.8 ± 1.5; 3.6 ± 1.5, p < 0.002; Figures 3D, S4S, S4U, and S4W); dmPGE2 only rescued dkk (11.8 ± 3.4, p < 0.001 versus dkk; Figures S4T). Together, these results suggest that cellular proliferation and apoptosis may be mechanisms by which PGE2 can modify the effects of wnt signaling on HSCs. The genetic interaction studies suggested that PGE2 may directly regulate β-catenin destruction, and subsequent protein available for transcriptional activation. To document whether PGE2 directly enhances β-catenin levels in vivo, western blot analysis was performed. wnt8 and dmPGE2 increased (Figures S3K), whereas indo decreased total β-catenin in WT and wnt8 pooled embryo lysates. qPCR revealed that PGE2 did not affect β-catenin transcription (Figures S3L). These data suggest that PGE2 directly influences the stability of β-catenin via non-transcriptional mechanisms. β-catenin levels are tightly controlled within the cell by the destruction complex, consisting of axin, GSK3β, CK1, and APC. In the absence of wnt ligand binding, β-catenin is phosphorylated at N-terminal residues and targeted for ubiquitination/ degradation. C-terminal phosphorylation of β-catenin (S675) stabilizes the protein by inhibiting destruction (Hino et al., 2005Hino S. Tanji C. Nakayama K.I. Kikuchi A. Phosphorylation of beta-catenin by cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase stabilizes beta-catenin through inhibition of its ubiquitination.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 9063-9072Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar), and destruction complex assembly can be blocked by phosphorylation of GSK3β at S9 (Fang et al., 2000Fang X. Yu S.X. Lu Y. Bast Jr., R.C. Woodgett J.R. Mills G.B. Phosphorylation and inactivation of glycogen synthase kinase 3 by protein kinase A.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2000; 97: 11960-11965Crossref PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar). PGE2 regulates intracellular phosphorylation through cAMP and downstream effector kinases PKA and PI3K/AKT (Fujino et al., 2002Fujino H. West K.A. Regan J.W. Phosphorylation of glycogen synthase kinase-3 and stimulation of T-cell factor signaling following activation of EP2 and EP4 prostanoid receptors by prostaglandin E2.J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2614-2619Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). To demonstrate a functional role for cAMP in modulating wnt activity and HSC development, TOP:dGFP embryos were exposed to forskolin, a cAMP-activator. Forskolin (0.5 μM) increased wnt activity (18 inc/21; 8.8 ± 1.3 TOP:dGFP + cells/tail [forskolin] versus 3.8 ± 0.8 [con], p < 0.001; Figures S5A, S5C, and S5E) and counteracted the wnt-inhibitory effects of indo (20 dec/25), confirming that cAMP functions downstream of PGE2 to regulate wnt signaling (17 norm/27; 6.4 ± 1.1 [indo + forskolin] versus 1.1 ± 0.7 [indo], p < 0.001; Figures S5B and S5D). We next sought to determine if PKA or PI3K was the secondary effector of cAMP in controlling wnt activity in the AGM in vivo. Exposure to the PKA inhibitor H89 (0.5 μM) decreased wnt activity compared to WT (19 dec/20; 0.6 ± 0.6; p < 0.001; Figures S5F, S5H, and S5L). In contrast, the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 (1 μM, LY) did not affect wnt activity appreciably (3 dec/27; 3.6 ± 1.1; Figures S5J and S5K). Furthermore, H89, but not LY, blocked PGE2-mediated elevation of wnt activity (23 inc/26 [PGE2]; 22 norm/25 [PGE2 + H89]; 20 inc/26 [PGE2 + LY]; 11.0 ± 1.6 [PGE2] versus 2.4 ± 1.1 [PGE2 + H89], p < 0.001; 9.8 ± 1.5 [PGE2 + LY]; Figures S5G, S5I, and S5K). These results suggest that PGE2 directly enhances wnt activity through cAMP/PKA-signaling. We next tested whether cAMP and PKA are functionally relevant in PGE2-mediated wnt regulation of HSCs in vivo. Exposure to forskolin increased HSCs (Figures 4C and 4G), and rescued the negative effect of indo treatment in WT (21 normal/33; Figure 4D) and wnt8 embryos (18 inc/26, Figure 4H). PKA inhibition by H89 diminished HSCs in WT embryos and eliminated the effects of dmPGE2 (13 norm/19; Figure 4L). H89 also inhibited the dmPGE2-mediated rescue of dkk embryos (17 dec/26; Figure 4P). The effects of cAMP/PKA modulation were quantitated by qPCR for runx1 (Figures S6A and S6B). The consequence of PKA inhibition was confirmed by exposure to 1 μM KT5720 (19 dec/31 [KT]; 20 norm/29 [PGE2 + KT]; Figures S6C–S6F). Treatment with the PI3K inhibitors LY (4 dec/39 [LY]; 34 inc/42 [PGE2 + LY]) and 1 μM Wortmannin (5 dec/48 [Wort]; 34 inc/46 [PGE2 + Wort]) did not considerably alter HSC development (Figures S6G–S6J). These data indicate PGE2 acts primarily via cAMP/PKA to affect wnt signaling and regulate HSC formation in vivo. Wnt signaling regulates adult HSC self-renewal, BM recovery and repopulation (Congdon et al., 2008Congdon K.L. Voermans C. Ferguson E.C. DiMascio L.N. Uqoezwa M. Zhao C. Reya T.

To determine whether the PGE2/wnt interaction affects hematopoietic regeneration in adult fish, we examined kidney marrow recovery following irradiation. In TOP:dGFP zebrafish, wnt activity was significantly increased in the recovering marrow compared to unirradiated controls (p < 0.001; Figure 5A). Wnt activity was significantly enhanced by dmPGE2 and markedly diminished by indo (p < 0.001; Figure 5A). FACS analysis of recovering marrow identifies effects on all hematopoietic lineages, including the stem/progenitor population. wnt8 induction significantly increased precursors (18.1 ± 3.5% [wnt8] versus 7.1 ± 3.1% [WT], p < 0.001; Figure 5B); treatment with indo significantly decreased precursor recovery (4.2 ± 2.1%, p < 0.02) and diminished the effect of wnt8 (11.6 ± 5.2%, p < 0.001), confirming that PGE2 modulates the effects of wnt activation in the adult. In support of this conclusion, the decrease in marrow recovery following induction of dkk (3.4 ± 1.1% [dkk] versus 7.0 ± 1.1% [WT]) was partially corrected by treatment with dmPGE2 (6.3 ± 1.0%, p < 0.001; Figure 5C). To determine whether the Wnt and PGE2 pathways interact similarly in the mammalian hematopoietic system, we examined in vitro differentiation of murine embryonic stem cells (mESC). Wnt3A increased the total number of hematopoietic progenitors, while indo led to reduction (p = 0.001; Figure S7A). Indo diminished the Wnt3A-induced increase (p < 0.01), demonstrating a conserved requirement for PGE2 in mediating the effects of Wnt stimulation. Dkk1 exposure reduced total colony number, indicating that Wnt activity is required for hematopoietic progenitor formation and/or expansion (Figure S7B). This decrease in hematopoietic progenitors was reverted by dmPGE2 (p = 0.046) or forskolin, demonstrating that as in zebrafish, PGE2 modulates Wnt-mediated effects on mammalian hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells via the cAMP/PKA pathway. By western blot analysis, Wnt3A and dmPGE2 treatment increased total β-catenin levels, while exogenous Dkk1 or indo markedly decreased β-caten"

Here, we show that an essential PRC component, Ezh2, is expressed in epidermal progenitors but diminishes concomitant with embryonic differentiation and with postnatal decline in proliferative activity. We show that Ezh2 controls proliferative potential of basal progenitors by repressing the Ink4A-Ink4B locus and tempers the developmental rate of differentiation by preventing premature recruitment of AP1 transcriptional activator to the structural genes that are required for epidermal differentiation. Together, our studies reveal that PRCs control epigenetic modifications temporally and spatially in tissue-restricted stem cells. They maintain their proliferative potential and globally repressing undesirable differentiation programs while selectively establishing a specific terminal differentiation program in a stepwise fashion.

Together, our studies reveal that PRCs control epigenetic modifications temporally and spatially in tissue-restricted stem cells. They maintain their proliferative potential and globally repressing undesirable differentiation programs while selectively establishing a specific terminal differentiation program in a stepwise fashion. One of the fundamental goals of modern biology is to understand the molecular mechanisms by which multipotent progenitor cells control tissue development and maintenance. Increasing evidence has pointed to a possible role for polycomb group (PcG) proteins in this process. PcG proteins form chromatin-remodeling complexes referred to as polycomb repressor complexes (PRCs) (Ringrose and Paro, 2004Ringrose L. Paro R. Epigenetic regulation of cellular memory by the Polycomb and Trithorax group proteins.Annu. Rev. Genet. 2004; 38: 413-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (867) Google Scholar). Comprised of Ezh2, Eed, and Suz12, PRC2 is recruited to chromatin, where methyltransferase Ezh2 catalyzes H3 trimethylation on lysine 27 (triMeK27-H3) (Cao et al., 2002Cao R. Wang L. Wang H. Xia L.

This histone mark then provides a platform to recruit PRC1 (Cao et al., 2002Cao R. Wang L. Wang H. Xia L. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Jones R.S. Zhang Y.

Without Ezh2 activity, PRC1 cannot be recruited to chromatin, and PcG-mediated repression is not established (Cao et al., 2002Cao R. Wang L. Wang H. Xia L. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Jones R.S.

In vitro studies of pluripotent mouse and human embryonic stem cells (ESCs) have shown that PRC2 proteins and their triMeK27-H3 marks reside at and transcriptionally repress many regulatory genes that control specific developmental lineages (Boyer et al., 2006Boyer L.A.

Establishing functional significance, Eed null ESCs have elevated expression of PcG-repressed differentiation genes (Boyer et al., 2006Boyer L.A. Plath K. Zeitlinger J. Brambrink T. Medeiros L.A.

Yee D. Magnuson T. Polycomb repressive complex 2 is dispensable for maintenance of embryonic stem cell pluripotency.Stem Cells. 2008; 26: 1496-1505Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, the genes in ESCs that are repressed by triMeK27-H3 frequently contain the additional H3 modification, lysine 4 trimethylation (triMeK4-H3), often associated with active chromatin (Bernstein et al., 2006Bernstein B.E. Mikkelsen T.S. Xie X. Kamal M. Huebert D.J. Cuff J. Fry B. Meissner A. Wernig M.

This has led to speculation that, through these bivalent marks, differentiation genes controlled by PRC2 may be poised for activation upon removal of their repressive epigenetic marks (Bernstein et al., 2006Bernstein B.E. Mikkelsen T.S. Xie X. Kamal M. Huebert D.J. Cuff J. Fry B. Meissner A. Wernig M.

Ray M.K. et al.Polycomb complexes repress developmental regulators in murine embryonic stem cells.Nature. 2006; 441: 349-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (2036) Google Scholar). That said, the role of PRC-mediated chromatin repression in regulating ESC differentiation is complex. Thus, cultured Suz12 null ESCs treated with retinoic acid do not execute normal neuronal differentiation but, rather, fail to suppress pluripotent genes and only partially activate neuronal genes (Pasini et al., 2007Pasini D. Bracken A.P. Hansen J.B. Capillo M. Helin K. The polycomb group protein Suz12 is required for embryonic stem cell differentiation.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 3769-3779Crossref PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar). This has led to speculation that PRCs are required for both suppression and activation of differentiation programs in ESCs. It remains an important challenge to determine whether these epigenetic mechanisms unveiled in vitro operate in vivo to govern fates of the more restricted progenitors that develop and maintain tissues (Spivakov and Fisher, 2007Spivakov M. Fisher A.G. Epigenetic signatures of stem-cell identity.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2007; 8: 263-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). Assessing the roles of PcG components in tissue organogenesis has been hampered by the early embryonic lethality caused by loss-of-function mutants of core PRC2 components. Conversely and further complicating interpretation is that conditional ablation of Ezh2 in adult bone marrow cells does not seem to affect either hematopoietic SC survival or lineage determination, suggesting either functional redundancy and/or compensation by paralogous PRC genes in at least some tissues (Su et al., 2003Su I.H. Basavaraj A. Krutchinsky A.N. Hobert O. Ullrich A. Chait B.T. Tarakhovsky A. Ezh2 controls B cell development through histone H3 methylation and Igh rearrangement.Nat.

This also seems to be the case for PRC1 genes such as Bmi1, in which mutations do not appear to affect embryogenesis (Sauvageau and Sauvageau, 2008Sauvageau M. Sauvageau G.

Ironically, Bmi1 mutants malfunction in maintaining hematopoietic and neuronal adult SC renewal, in part due to misregulation of the Ink4A/Arf locus (Bruggeman et al., 2005Bruggeman S.W.

That said, triMeK27-H3 epigenetic marks are still apparent in Bmi1 null cells (Cao et al., 2005Cao R. Tsukada Y. Zhang Y. Role of Bmi-1 and Ring1A in H2A ubiquitylation and Hox gene silencing.Mol. Cell. 2005; 20: 845-854Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (681) Google Scholar), suggesting that the phenotype does not reflect complete abrogation of PcG-repressive functions. These findings underscore the importance of analyzing PcG functions in other in vivo biological systems in order to understand their physiological relevance in tissue development and maintenance. Mammalian epidermis is an excellent model to address this problem. Epidermal lineages originate from a single layer of multipotent progenitors, basal cells, that adhere to an underlying basement membrane separating epidermis from dermis (Fuchs, 2007Fuchs E. Scratching the surface of skin development.Nature. 2007; 445: 834-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar). In mice, epidermal stratification and fate specification initiate at approximately embryonic day 14 (E14) and complete shortly before birth, when the skin surface barrier is required to keep harmful microbes out and prevent dehydration (Fuchs, 2007Fuchs E. Scratching the surface of skin development.Nature. 2007; 445: 834-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar). Basal cells continually fuel the production of ∼10 suprabasal layers. Once cells exit the basal layer, they downregulate proliferation-associated genes and execute a terminal differentiation program that is marked by a stepwise transcriptional transition from early differentiation spinous layers to late differentiation granular layers. In the last step, all metabolic activity ceases as dead squames of the protective stratum corneum are formed and subsequently sloughed from the skin surface (Watt et al., 2006Watt F.M. Lo Celso C. Silva-Vargas V. Epidermal stem cells: an update.Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2006; 16: 518-524Crossref Scopus (164) Google Scholar). In this report, we use epidermis as a model to explore the functional significance and physiological relevance of PcG-mediated chromatin repression during embryonic tissue development and homeostasis. We unveil Ezh2 as a critical mediator of chromatin repression in embryonic basal cells and show that its expression diminishes with age and with commitment to terminally differentiate in vivo and in vitro. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) performed on purified embryonic epidermal progenitors, we show that its triMeK27-H3 mark is present both on silent epidermal genes activated late in terminal differentiation and on nonepidermal genes, e.g., neuronal and muscle transcriptional regulators. Interestingly, however, despite this broad association of triMeK27-H3 with silenced genes of different tissue lineages, loss of PcG-mediated repression does not alter the fate of epidermal cells. Rather, it reduces their proliferation through upregulation of the Ink4A-Ink4B locus and tempers differentiation rates and barrier function acquisition by upregulating late-stage epidermal differentiation genes, many of which are controlled by AP1 transcriptional activators. We show that the triMeK27-H3 mark prevents AP1 proteins from binding to these target genes in basal cells and that, during terminal differentiation, these late differentiation genes lose their histone mark, associate with AP1 components, and become activated suprabasally. Our findings provide new mechanistic insights into PcG-mediated repression of tissue-specific differentiation genes and suggest that the spatial balance between expression of PcG epigenetic repressors in undifferentiated cells and transcriptional activators like AP1 in differentiated cells controls proper establishment of the stepwise mechanism of epidermal differentiation during skin development. At E14, epidermis consists of a basal layer of progenitors and a layer of suprabasal cells that have initiated a program of terminal differentiation but are still proliferative (Figures S1A and S1B available online) (Lechler and Fuchs, 2005Lechler T. Fuchs E. Asymmetric cell divisions promote stratification and differentiation of mammalian skin.Nature. 2005; 437: 275-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (759) Google Scholar, Watt et al., 2006Watt F.M. Lo Celso C. Silva-Vargas V. Epidermal stem cells: an update.Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2006; 16: 518-524Crossref Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Purification of these two populations by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) and transcriptional profiling revealed that PcG components of PRC2 (Ezh2 and Eed) and PRC1 (Bmi1, Cbx2, and Pcgf2) are expressed in basal cells and downregulated suprabasally. Semiquantitative PCR (RT-PCR) and anti-Ezh2 immunofluorescence confirmed these patterns (Figures 1A and 1B and data not shown). By E16–E18, proliferation is restricted to the basal layer, and the epidermis consists of multiple layers of differentiating suprabasal cells (Figures S1C and S1D). At these stages, Ezh2 was strong in basal but weak in spinous, granular, and stratum corneum layers (Figures 1C). After birth, Ezh2 waned, and by postnatal day 9 (P9), Ezh2 was barely detected even in basal cells (Figure 1D). The 5-Bromo-2′-deoxyuridine (BrdU) pulses administered at different developmental ages revealed that the % BrdU(+) basal cells also decreased steadily with age (Figure 1E) and that the few remaining Ezh2(+) cells were also BrdU(+) (Figure 1F). In vitro, cultured basal epidermal cells exposed to elevated calcium stop proliferating and initiate terminal differentiation (Hennings et al., 1980Hennings H. Michael D. Cheng C. Steinert P. Holbrook K. Yuspa S.H. Calcium regulation of growth and differentiation of mouse epidermal cells in culture.Cell. 1980; 19: 245-254Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1502) Google Scholar). Similar to their behavior in vivo, basal mouse keratinocytes (MK) expressed high levels of PcG mRNAs and protein, which progressively declined upon calcium-induced differentiation (Figures 1G and 1H). Both in vivo and in vitro, Ezh2 in proliferating, undifferentiated MK was largely, if not solely, nuclear (Figures 1I and 1J). Therefore, we pursued the notion that, in epidermal MK, Ezh2 functions in the nucleus. In mouse ESCs, PRC2 marks and globally represses genes involved in the specification of lineages, including those of the epidermal lineage (Boyer et al., 2006Boyer L.A. Plath K. Zeitlinger J. Brambrink T. Medeiros L.A. Lee T.I. Levine S.S. Wernig M. Tajonar A. Ray M.K. et al.Polycomb complexes repress developmental regulators in murine embryonic stem cells.Nature. 2006; 441: 349-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (2036) Google Scholar). To evaluate the extent to which the repressed PRC2 targets of mouse ESCs are maintained in Ezh2(+) embryonic epidermis, we performed ChIP assays with FACS-purified embryonic epidermal basal cells and Abs against triMeK27-H3 and unmodified histone H3 (Figures S2A and S2B). We first focused on nonepidermal “master” transcriptional regulators of the Hox, neuronal (Neurog1, Neurog2, Olig2, and Olig3), and muscle (Myod1) families that are marked for PcG-mediated repression in ESCs (Boyer et al., 2006Boyer L.A. Plath K. Zeitlinger J. Brambrink T. Medeiros L.A. Lee T.I. Levine S.S. Wernig M. Tajonar A.

Many of these genes were also transcriptionally repressed by triMeK27-H3 in basal epidermal cells (Figures 2A and 2B). We next focused on identifying epidermal lineage genes targeted by PcG repression in Ezh2(+) embryonic basal cells. For these studies, we analyzed promoters of basal genes, which are transcriptionally active, as well as spinous and granular layer genes, which are not expressed at this stage of differentiation. Our tests included genes previously found in ESCs to be enriched for PcG-mediated repression, as well as other epidermal genes. Interestingly, genes enriched for triMeK27-H3 in embryonic basal cells showed a good inverse correlation between Ezh2 and terminal differentiation (Figures 2C and 2D) (Fuchs, 2007Fuchs E. Scratching the surface of skin development.Nature. 2007; 445: 834-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar). Genes coexpressed with Ezh2 in either embryonic basal or early (spinous) layers (actinb1, K14, K1, and K10) were not enriched for triMeK27-H3 in basal progenitors, whereas genes expressed in granular cells (loricrin, filaggrin, Lce1, Lce1a2, and Crct1) showed significant triMeK27-H3 enrichment in embryonic basal cells. Intriguingly, the triMeK27-H3 status of genes in the embryonic basal epidermal layer in vivo differed from that in cultured ESCs, in which both early (K1) and late epidermal differentiation genes (loricrin and Lce1a2) scored as targets of PcG-mediated repression (Boyer et al., 2006Boyer L.A. Plath K. Zeitlinger J. Brambrink T. Medeiros L.A. Lee T.I. Levine S.S. Wernig M. Tajonar A. Ray M.K. et al.Polycomb complexes repress developmental regulators in murine embryonic stem cells.Nature. 2006; 441: 349-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (2036) Google Scholar). Thus, whereas some PcG targets established in pluripotent cells appear to be maintained in the epidermal lineage, others may lose their repressive mark during tissue development. To address the physiological significance of Ezh2's interesting pattern of gene expression, we conducted conditional loss-of-function studies. Mice harboring the floxed Ezh2 allele (Su et al., 2003Su I.H. Basavaraj A. Krutchinsky A.N. Hobert O. Ullrich A. Chait B.T. Tarakhovsky A. Ezh2 controls B cell development through histone H3 methylation and Igh rearrangement.Nat. Immunol. 2003; 4: 124-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar) were bred to mice expressing Cre recombinase under the keratin 14 (K14) promoter in embryonic epidermal progenitors (Vasioukhin et al., 1999Vasioukhin V. Degenstein L. Wise B. Fuchs E. The magical touch: Genome targeting in epidermal stem cells induced by tamoxifen application to mouse skin.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1999; 96: 8551-8556Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar). Ezh2 conditional knockout (Ezh2 cKO) mice were born alive and in the expected Mendelian ratios. Immunofluorescence and western blot analyses revealed a loss of Ezh2 and triMeK27-H3 marks in basal cells (Figures 3A–3C and S3A), underscoring their reliance upon Ezh2 for establishment and maintenance of this mark. TriMeK27-H3 was still detected in suprabasal cells, most likely because the Ezh2 paralog, Ezh1, is expressed throughout embryonic epidermis and in basal cells of postnatal skin (Figure S8A). We return to this issue later. In the absence of Ezh2, basal epidermal cells were less proliferative, exhibiting reductions in Ki67(+) cells and BrdU labeling (Figures 3D–3F). During early postnatal development when Ezh2 was still expressed in WT basal cells, the % BrdU(+) basal cells in Ezh2 cKO skin was more than 2-fold diminished. As Ezh2 waned in postnatal WT basal cells, the % BrdU(+) basal cells within cKO and WT skins became comparable (Figure 3F). When cultured, P0 Ezh2 cKO and WT basal cells both formed similar-sized colonies with comparable efficiencies (Figures S3B and S3C). However, whereas WT colonies were composed of tightly packed small cells, cells within cKO colonies were often larger, flat, and loosely packed (Figure 3G). After several days in culture, the growth of Ezh2 cKO cultures began to slow (Figure 3H). This reduction did not appear to be attributable to increased apoptosis (Figure 3J) nor to altered growth factor-stimulated actin dynamics (Su et al., 2005Su I.H. Dobenecker M.W. Dickinson E. Oser M. Basavaraj A. Marqueron R. Viale A. Reinberg D. Wulfing C. Tarakhovsky A. Polycomb group protein ezh2 controls actin polymerization and cell signaling.Cell. 2005; 121: 425-436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar) (Figure 1). Instead, cell-cycle analysis revealed an increase in G1/G0 and decrease in S phase cKO cells compared to WT (Figure 3I). Consistent with a reduction in S phase entry, the phosphorylation of retinoblastoma protein was reduced in cKO cells (Figure S3D). The proliferation defect in Ezh2 cKO skin appeared to be attributed, at least in part, to derepression of the Ink4B-Arf-Ink4A tumor suppressor locus that encodes potent cell-cycle inhibitors of the G1-to-S transition in a variety of cell types, including epidermis (Bracken et al., 2007Bracken A.P.

Consistent with prior studies that established Ink4B-Arf-Ink4A as a PcG target, we observed an ∼10-fold upregulation of Ink4B in FACS-purified Ezh2 cKO cells in vivo (Figure 3K) and a similar marked upregulation of both Ink4A and Ink4B genes in Ezh2 null MK in vitro (Figure 3L). Finally, in WT skin, Ink4B expression inversely correlated with Ezh2 (Figure 3K, basal versus total). P0 Ezh2 cKO epidermis displayed a hyperthickened stratum corneum and pronounced granular layer accompanied by the expansion of the granular markers loricrin and filaggrin (Figures 4A–4C). These defects were also apparent in E16 cKO skin concomitant with loss of Ezh2 and basal triMeK27-H3 (Figures 4D–4F, S4A, and S4B). Ultrastructurally, the immature large keratohyalin granules (KG) of WT E16 skin were already dispersed in cKO skin (Figures 4G and S4C) (Fuchs, 2007Fuchs E. Scratching the surface of skin development.Nature. 2007; 445: 834-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar, Steven et al., 1990Steven A.C. Bisher M.E. Roop D.R. Steinert P.M. Biosynthetic pathways of filaggrin and loricrin–Two major proteins expressed by terminally differentiated epidermal keratinocytes.J. Struct. Biol. 1990; 104: 150-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). A well-formed stratum corneum was also evident, and with proper preservation, highly ordered lipid lamellae interconnected these cells only within the E16 Ezh2 cKO (Figure S4D). Correspondingly, the nonepidermal periderm (P) layer that normally provides a temporary barrier during epidermal maturation was already degenerated (Figures 4D, 4G, and S4C). These various signs of accelerated development (Jaubert et al., 2003Jaubert J. Cheng J. Segre J.A. Ectopic expression of kruppel like factor 4 (Klf4) accelerates formation of the epidermal permeability barrier.Development. 2003; 130: 2767-2777Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, Patel et al., 2006Patel S. Xi Z.F. Seo E.Y. McGaughey D. Segre J.A. Klf4 and corticosteroids activate an overlapping set of transcriptional targets to accelerate in utero epidermal barrier acquisition.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2006; 103: 18668-18673Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) were manifested functionally in the precocious acquisition of the epidermal barrier capable of excluding dye (Figure 4H). To understand how loss of Ezh2 might result in accelerated epidermal differentiation, we conducted transcriptional profiling of FACS-purified basal cells from E16 Ezh2 cKO and WT skins to determine the global consequences of Ezh2 loss to epidermal gene expression. The data are compiled in Figure 5A, with upregulated genes in red and downregulated genes in green. As expected, loss of Ezh2 resulted mostly in gene upregulation in basal cells. Surprisingly, however, only a small fraction of the genes analyzed showed a more than 2-fold change compared to WT. Of the 94 genes (0.2%) upregulated, 75% were epidermal genes, and among the others, there did not appear to be a significant bias toward any specific developmental lineage (Table S1). Thus, despite the global association of triMeK27-H3 marks with epidermal and nonepidermal genes (Figures 2A and 2C), the loss of Ezh2 in basal cells led primarily to selective upregulation of epidermal genes. In this regard, PRC-mediated repression in basal epidermal cells appeared to differ markedly from ESCs, in which PRC target genes encompassing multiple lineages were upregulated when PcG function was compromised (Boyer et al., 2006Boyer L.A. Plath K. Zeitlinger J. Brambrink T. Medeiros L.A. Lee T.I. Levine S.S. Wernig M. Tajonar A. Ray M.K. et al.Polycomb complexes repress developmental regulators in murine embryonic stem cells.Nature. 2006; 441: 349-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (2036) Google Scholar). As judged by array and RT-PCR, genes associated with basal and/or early (spinous) differentiation were unaffected by loss of Ezh2 (Figures 5B and 5C), and this was consistent with the lack of triMeK27-H3 marks at their promoters (Figure 2C). Notably, this included transcription factors, e.g., Trp63, Tcf3, Notch, Hes1, AP2, cEBP, and Klf4, that have been implicated in either maintenance of the undifferentiated state or induction of terminal differentiation (Fuchs, 2007Fuchs E.

QT interval duration, reflecting myocardial repolarization on the electrocardiogram, is a heritable risk factor for sudden cardiac death and drug-induced arrhythmias. We conducted a meta-analysis of three genome-wide association studies in 13,685 individuals of European ancestry from the Framingham Heart Study, the Rotterdam Study and the Cardiovascular Health Study, as part of the QTGEN consortium. We observed associations at P < 5 × 10−8 with variants in NOS1AP, KCNQ1, KCNE1, KCNH2 and SCN5A, known to be involved in myocardial repolarization and mendelian long-QT syndromes. Associations were found at five newly identified loci, including 16q21 near NDRG4 and GINS3, 6q22 near PLN, 1p36 near RNF207, 16p13 near LITAF and 17q12 near LIG3 and RFFL. Collectively, the 14 independent variants at these 10 loci explain 5.4–6.5% of the variation in QT interval. These results, together with an accompanying paper, offer insights into myocardial repolarization and suggest candidate genes that could predispose to sudden cardiac death and drug-induced arrhythmias."

https://openalex.org/W2127610235,"The balance of excitation and inhibition across large populations of spiking neurons has been suggested to be important. Here the authors model the effects of a more detailed balance between incoming excitation and local inhibition on the transmission of signals through a neural network. Recent theoretical work has provided a basic understanding of signal propagation in networks of spiking neurons, but mechanisms for gating and controlling these signals have not been investigated previously. Here we introduce an idea for the gating of multiple signals in cortical networks that combines principles of signal propagation with aspects of balanced networks. Specifically, we studied networks in which incoming excitatory signals are normally cancelled by locally evoked inhibition, leaving the targeted layer unresponsive. Transmission can be gated 'on' by modulating excitatory and inhibitory gains to upset this detailed balance. We illustrate gating through detailed balance in large networks of integrate-and-fire neurons. We show successful gating of multiple signals and study failure modes that produce effects reminiscent of clinically observed pathologies. Provided that the individual signals are detectable, detailed balance has a large capacity for gating multiple signals."
https://openalex.org/W2140820666,"The recent identification of several novel endocytic compartments has challenged our current understanding of the topological and functional organization of the endocytic pathway. Using quantitative single vesicle imaging and acute manipulation of phosphoinositides we show that APPL endosomes, which participate in growth factor receptor trafficking and signaling, represent an early endocytic intermediate common to a subset of clathrin derived endocytic vesicles and macropinosomes. Most APPL endosomes are precursors of classical PI3P positive endosomes, and PI3P plays a critical role in promoting this conversion. Depletion of PI3P causes a striking reversion of Rab5 positive endosomes to the APPL stage, and results in enhanced growth factor signaling. These findings reveal a surprising plasticity of the early endocytic pathway. Importantly, PI3P functions as a switch to dynamically regulate maturation and signaling of APPL endosomes."

Full understanding of the molecular functions of these enzymes requires the identification of nonchromatin substrates. The enzymatic activities of HATs and HDACs are closely related to the metabolic condition of the cells, whereas acetylation and deacetylation of metabolic enzymes also plays a pivotal role in adaptation of the cells to changing energy status (Schwer and Verdin, 2008Schwer B. Verdin E. Conserved metabolic regulatory functions of sirtuins.Cell Metab. 2008; 7: 104-112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). In yeast, histone acetylation and global gene transcription is directly regulated by abundance of a key metabolic intermediate, acetyl-CoA, which in turn is determined by nucleocytoplasmic acetyl-CoA synthetase activity (Takahashi et al., 2006Takahashi H. McCaffery J.M. Irizarry R.A. Boeke J.D. Nucleocytosolic acetyl-coenzyme a synthetase is required for histone acetylation and global transcription.Mol.

A large number of cytoplasmic and mitochondrial metabolic enzymes were recently reported to be subject to (de)acetylation in mammals (Kim et al., 2006Kim S.C. Sprung R. Chen Y. Xu Y. Ball H. Pei J. Cheng T. Kho Y. Xiao H. Xiao L. et al.Substrate and functional diversity of lysine acetylation revealed by a proteomics survey.Mol. Cell. 2006; 23: 607-618Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1130) Google Scholar), but the responsible (de)acetylases remain largely unknown. The intersection of metabolism and protein (de)acetylation is further reflected by the links between sirtuins and life span regulation in yeast, worms, fruit flies, and possibly mammals (Guarente and Picard, 2005Guarente L. Picard F. Calorie restriction—the SIR2 connection.Cell. 2005; 120: 473-482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar, Schwer and Verdin, 2008Schwer B. Verdin E. Conserved metabolic regulatory functions of sirtuins.Cell Metab. 2008; 7: 104-112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). In yeast, limiting the concentration of either glucose or amino acids in the medium can lengthen both replicative life span (RLS; defined as the number of mitotic divisions occurring in a mother cell before senescence) and chronological life span (CLS; defined as the period of time for a cell to survive in stationary phase) (Fabrizio et al., 2005Fabrizio P.

Extension of chronological life span in yeast by decreased TOR pathway signaling.Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 174-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar). SIR2 plays an antagonistic role in the extension of CLS under water starvation (Fabrizio et al., 2005Fabrizio P. Gattazzo C. Battistella L. Wei M. Cheng C. McGrew K. Longo V.D. Sir2 blocks extreme life-span extension.Cell. 2005; 123: 655-667Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). Although the detailed mechanism is largely unknown, the effect of SIR2 on CLS is partly mediated by SIR2-dependent inactivation of alcohol dehydrogenase 2 (ADH2), which depletes extracellular ethanol, a proposed central mediator of chronological longevity in yeast (Fabrizio et al., 2005Fabrizio P. Gattazzo C. Battistella L. Wei M. Cheng C. McGrew K. Longo V.D. Sir2 blocks extreme life-span extension.Cell. 2005; 123: 655-667Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). Although ethanol was shown to be critical in this longevity paradigm, and the requirement for deacetylase activity in blocking extreme life-span extension was demonstrated, no relevant Sir2 substrate(s) were identified. Here, we report 13 nonchromatin substrates of the NuA4 complex identified by a protein acetylation microarray approach. In-depth analysis of one substrate, Pck1p, provides evidence of a metabolic enzyme (de)acetylation state controlling the gluconeogenic flux in the yeast and possibly human cells. Remarkably, Pck1p acetylation is necessary and sufficient for extension of yeast chronological longevity under water starvation. To fully understand the molecular functions of the NuA4 complex, we sought its substrates using yeast proteome microarrays (Lu et al., 2008Lu J.Y. Lin Y.Y. Qian J. Tao S.C. Zhu J. Pickart C. Zhu H. Functional dissection of a HECT ubiquitin E3 ligase.Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2008; 7: 35-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, Zhu et al., 2001Zhu H. Bilgin M. Bangham R. Hall D. Casamayor A. Bertone P. Lan N. Jansen R. Bidlingmaier S. Houfek T. et al.Global analysis of protein activities using proteome chips.Science. 2001; 293: 2101-2105Crossref PubMed Scopus (1857) Google Scholar). First, we developed an in vitro acetylation reaction on a pilot microarray containing histones H3, H4, and bovine serum albumin (BSA). To optimize reaction conditions and surface chemistry (Tao et al., 2007Tao S.C. Chen C.S. Zhu H. Applications of protein microarray technology.Comb. Chem. High Throughput Screen. 2007; 10: 706-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), we performed the assay using both the NuA4 and Spt-Ada-Gcn5-acetyltransferase (SAGA) complexes and [14C]-acetyl-CoA as a labeling reagent on three surfaces at various reaction temperatures and times. NuA4 and SAGA complexes showed preference for H4 and H3, respectively, as expected (Sterner and Berger, 2000Sterner D.E. Berger S.L. Acetylation of histones and transcription-related factors.Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2000; 64: 435-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (1304) Google Scholar) on the FAST (nitrocellulose) slide (see Figure S1 available online). No detectable signals were observed for BSA. We then carried out acetylation reactions in duplicate with the NuA4 complex on proteome microarrays containing 5800 yeast proteins (Zhu et al., 2001Zhu H. Bilgin M. Bangham R. Hall D. Casamayor A. Bertone P. Lan N. Jansen R. Bidlingmaier S. Houfek T. et al.Global analysis of protein activities using proteome chips.Science. 2001; 293: 2101-2105Crossref PubMed Scopus (1857) Google Scholar). We found that 91 proteins were readily acetylated by NuA4 (see Figure 1A and Table S1 for a full list of candidate substrates). Gene ontology (GO) analysis indicated that these candidate substrates were enriched for nucleosome assembly and histone binding activities, and depleted for mitochondrial and membrane-associated proteins, as expected. However, significant proportions (p < 10−4) of the candidate substrates are cytoplasmic proteins such as Pck1p. Therefore, we chose 20 candidates involved in regulating metabolism (Glk1p, Gph1p, Gsy2p, Pck1p, Sip2p, Sip5p, and Tap42p), transcription (Nnt1p and Ume1p), cell cycle progression (Cdc34p, Ctf4p, Rpt5p, and Skp1p), RNA processing (Brx1p and Prp19p), and stress response (Atg3p, Atg11p, Hsp104p, Imp2′p, and Plp2p) for further validation. We tested the ability of the NuA4 complex to acetylate these candidate substrates using standard in vitro activity assays (Smith et al., 1998Smith E.R. Eisen A. Gu W. Sattah M. Pannuti A. Zhou J. Cook R.G. Lucchesi J.C. Allis C.D. ESA1 is a histone acetyltransferase that is essential for growth in yeast.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1998; 95: 3561-3565Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar) and confirmed 13 substrates (Atg3p, Atg11p, Brx1p, Cdc34p, Gph1p, Hsp104p, Nnt1p, Pck1p, Prp19p, Rpt5p, Sip2p, Sip5p, and Tap42p), as detected by immunoprecipitation (IP) with a monoclonal anti-pan-acetyl-lysine antibody (Li et al., 2007Li Y. Yokota T. Gama V. Yoshida T. Gomez J.A. Ishikawa K. Sasaguri H. Cohen H.Y. Sinclair D.A. Mizusawa H. Matsuyama S. Bax-inhibiting peptide protects cells from polyglutamine toxicity caused by Ku70 acetylation.Cell Death Differ. 2007; 14: 2058-2067Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar; Figures 1B and S2A), followed by immunoblotting with an anti-TAG antibody. Because in vitro enzymatic assays could suffer from promiscuity caused by nonphysiologic conditions created in the experiments, we further validated the substrates with in vivo experiments performed in an ESA1 Ts (esa1-531) mutant (Lin et al., 2008Lin Y.Y. Qi Y. Lu J.Y. Pan X. Yuan D.S. Zhao Y. Bader J.S. Boeke J.D. A comprehensive synthetic genetic interaction network governing yeast histone acetylation and deacetylation.Genes Dev. 2008; 22: 2062-2074Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). We found that all the in vitro substrates were also acetylated in the wild-type (WT) cells; their acetylated fractions dramatically diminished in esa1-531 at nonpermissive temperature (Figure 1C and Figure S2B). Furthermore, the in vivo acetylation signals in the IP assay could be efficiently competed with lysine-acetylated BSA (Ac-K-BSA), indicating the specificity of the detected acetylation signals (Figure S3). Together, these data suggested that Gph1p, Pck1p, Sip2p, Sip5p, Tap42p, Nnt1p, Cdc34p, Rpt5p, Brx1p, Prp19p, Atg3p, Atg11p, and Hsp104p are in vivo substrates of Esa1p. More than half the confirmed in vivo substrates of NuA4 are enzymes (Atg3p, Gph1p, and Pck1p) or effectors (Atg11p, Sip2p, Sip5p, and Tap42p) involved in signaling pathways responsive to nutrient availability and energy status. To explore the possible link between NuA4 acetylation and metabolism, we focused on Pck1p for several reasons. First, it is a cytosolic nonchromatin substrate. Second, it is a well-studied enzyme (Baly et al., 1985Baly D.L. Keen C.L. Hurley L.S. Pyruvate carboxylase and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase activity in developing rats: effect of manganese deficiency.J. Nutr. 1985; 115: 872-879PubMed Google Scholar, Hanson and Reshef, 1997Hanson R.W. Reshef L. Regulation of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (GTP) gene expression.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 581-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (610) Google Scholar). Finally, it seemed to provide a potential insight into a poorly understood connection between acetylation and metabolism. Moreover, the important role of the human enzyme in diabetes (Burgess et al., 2007Burgess S.C. He T. Yan Z. Lindner J. Sherry A.D. Malloy C.R. Browning J.D.

Massillon D. Tolentino-Silva F. Nye C.K. Cabrera M.E. Hagen D.R. Utter C.B. Baghdy Y. et al.Overexpression of the cytosolic form of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (GTP) in skeletal muscle repatterns energy metabolism in the mouse.J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 32844-32855Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) made it interesting. PCK1 encodes the intricately regulated phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK), catalyzing the rate-limiting step in gluconeogenesis by converting oxaloacetate (OAA) and ATP to phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP), ADP, and CO2. We applied tandem mass spectrometric (MS/MS) analysis and identified lysines 19 (K19) and 514 (K514) as potential acetylation sites for the NuA4 complex (Figure S4). A K514 arginine mutant (K514R) was generated to test association of acetylation of Pck1p with NuA4 activity. In vitro and in vivo assays showed that NuA4-dependent acetylation of overproduced Pck1p (Figures 2A–2C) or endogenously expressed (Figure 2D) was almost completely dependent on K514, suggesting that NuA4 acetylates Pck1p at K514. Conversely, acetylation at K19 is far less abundant than K514 in vivo (Figure 2E), and a K19R mutation did not affect efficient acetylation by NuA4 in vitro (Figure 2F). Because acetylation is reversible, we applied a similar in vivo approach to search for Pck1p deacetylase. A substantial increase of acetylated Pck1p was observed in the sir2Δ mutant, but not in hda1Δ or rpd3Δ mutants (Figure 3A). SIR2 encodes an NAD+-dependent HDAC involved in chromatin silencing (Rusche et al., 2003Rusche L.N. Kirchmaier A.L. Rine J. The establishment, inheritance, and function of silenced chromatin in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2003; 72: 481-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar), and the other two encode major HDACs governing global histone deacetylation and transcriptional control (Vogelauer et al., 2000Vogelauer M. Wu J. Suka N. Grunstein M. Global histone acetylation and deacetylation in yeast.Nature. 2000; 408: 495-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). Moreover, affinity-purified Sir2p, but not Hda1p (Figure S5), effectively deacetylated purified Pck1p in vitro in an NAD+-dependent reaction (Figure 3B). Acetylation of endogenous Pck1p increased significantly in the sir2Δ mutant (Figure 2D); in summary, Esa1p and Sir2p specifically catalyze reversible (de)acetylation at K514 of Pck1 in vivo. PCK1 mRNA and protein are highly induced during a diauxic shift, i.e., the glycolysis to gluconeogenesis shift as glucose is depleted (Schuller, 2003Schuller H.J. Transcriptional control of nonfermentative metabolism in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Curr. Genet. 2003; 43: 139-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar, Zaman et al., 2008Zaman S. Lippman S.I. Zhao X. Broach J.R. How Saccharomyces responds to nutrients.Annu. Rev. Genet. 2008; 42: 27-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). To determine whether (de)acetylation of Pck1p controls its induction, we compared endogenous protein levels of chromosomally tagged Pck1p in esa1-531, sir2Δ, gcn5Δ (the catalytic subunit of the SAGA complex), and hda1Δ mutants with the WT strain. Except for gcn5Δ, none of these mutations significantly affected Pck1p abundance (Figure 3C). Consistent with this finding, neither K514R nor K514Q mutations significantly affected Pck1p abundance (Figure 3C). We checked PCK1 mRNA levels in HAT and HDAC deletion mutants during a diauxic shift, and observed that PCK1 mRNA increased ∼8-fold in esa1-531 grown at nonpermissive temperature, and decreased slightly in sir2Δ (Figure 3D). Interestingly, PCK1 mRNA increased 3-fold in hda1Δ, and decreased significantly in gcn5Δ (Figure 3D), suggesting that Hda1p and Gcn5p repress and activate PCK1 transcription via chromatin modification, respectively, on nonfermentable carbon sources (NFCSs). These results confirm previous functional genomics studies of yeast HDACs, in which Hda1p deacetylates (and probably suppresses) Hda1-affected subtelomeric domains in subtelomeric chromatin containing gluconeogenic genes (Robyr et al., 2002Robyr D. Suka Y. Xenarios I. Kurdistani S.K. Wang A. Suka N. Grunstein M. Microarray deacetylation maps determine genome-wide functions for yeast histone deacetylases.Cell. 2002; 109: 437-446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar), and clarify the previously unexplained finding that yeast SAGA is essential for growth on ethanol (van Voorst et al., 2006van Voorst F. Houghton-Larsen J. Jonson L. Kielland-Brandt M.C. Brandt A. Genome-wide identification of genes required for growth of Saccharomyces cerevisiae under ethanol stress.Yeast. 2006; 23: 351-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). In addition, we observed that C-terminally GFP-tagged Pck1p localized to both nucleus and cytoplasm, independent of (de)acetylation status (Figure S6). Because Pck1p functions as a homotetramer in vivo (Ravanal et al., 2003Ravanal M.C. Goldie H. Cardemil E. Thermal stability of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinases from Escherichia coli, Trypanosoma brucei, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae.J. Protein Chem. 2003; 22: 311-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar), we also examined Pck1p oligomerization status by size exclusion chromatography; its oligomerization was normal in esa1-531 and sir2Δ (Figure S7). To determine whether (de)acetylation of Pck1p was physiologically relevant, we monitored viability of various mutants on NFCSs. Gluconeogenesis is essential for yeast growth on NFCSs, such as ethanol and glycerol, allowing replenishment of sugar phosphate stores important for biomass generation (Schuller, 2003Schuller H.J. Transcriptional control of nonfermentative metabolism in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Curr. Genet. 2003; 43: 139-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). Deletion of PCK1 is lethal when ethanol is the only available carbon source (Figure 4A). Adding glycerol and ethanol (GE) bypasses the need of Pck1p in the early stages of the pathway and rescues pck1Δ lethality (Figure 4A). Similar phenotypes were observed for esa1-531 grown at a semipermissive temperature but not at permissive temperature (Figure S8), and for the pck1-K514R mutant grown on either ethanol or GE, suggesting acetylation at K514 of Pck1p is crucial for function (Figure 4A). There was no additive effect on the growth defect in the esa1-531/pck1-514R double mutant on NFCSs (Figure S9). Consistent with this result, substitution of K514 with glutamine (K514Q) almost completely rescued the esa1-531 growth defect on ethanol or GE (Figure 4A). Moreover, deletion of SIR2 did not rescue pck1-K514R growth defects on ethanol or GE, suggesting that K514 is the only Pck1p lysine residue targeted by Sir2p (Figure S10). Overexpression of SIR2 by introducing an extra copy of SIR2 on a centromeric plasmid (2X SIR2 in Figure S11A) does not significantly affect growth on glucose, ethanol, or GE (Figure S11B). Although both GCN5 and HDA1 regulate PCK1 at the mRNA level, only deletion of GCN5 showed similar growth defects, consistent with its effect on Pck1p abundance (Figures 3C, 3E, and 4B). Interestingly, both pck1-K514Q and sir2Δ enhanced growth on high concentrations of ethanol (Figure 4C), indicating the contribution of gluconeogenesis to ethanol tolerance in yeast. These results prompted us to investigate whether acetylation directly affects Pck1"

The transcription factor USF is required for the activation of FAS transcription, and we show here that USF phosphorylation by DNA-PK, which is dephosphorylated by PP1 in response to feeding, triggers a switch-like mechanism. Under fasting conditions, USF-1 is deacetylated by HDAC9, causing promoter inactivation. In contrast, feeding induces the recruitment of DNA-PK to USF-1 and its phosphorylation, which then allows recruitment of P/CAF, resulting in USF-1 acetylation and FAS promoter activation. DNA break/repair components associated with USF induce transient DNA breaks during FAS activation. In DNA-PK-deficient SCID mice, feeding-induced USF-1 phosphorylation/acetylation, DNA breaks, and FAS activation leading to lipogenesis are impaired, resulting in decreased triglyceride levels. Our study demonstrates that a kinase central to the DNA damage response mediates metabolic gene activation.

Our study demonstrates that a kinase central to the DNA damage response mediates metabolic gene activation. To meet the constant energy requirement in the face of highly variable food supply, mammals employ intricate and precise mechanisms for energy storage. During feeding, excess carbohydrates are converted to fatty acids (de novo lipogenesis) for synthesis/storage of triacylglycerol, which can then be utilized during energy shortage, i.e., fasting. Lipogenesis is under tight nutritional and hormonal control (Sul and Wang, 1998Sul H.S. Wang D.

The expression of the lipogenic enzymes is very low in fasting and is drastically upregulated during feeding accompanied by an increase in insulin secretion (Sul et al., 2000Sul H.S. Latasa M.J.

Thus, precise temporal changes in patterns of gene repression and activation are required for lipogenic gene regulation during fasting and feeding/insulin treatment. By catalyzing seven reactions in fatty acid synthesis, FAS is a central enzyme in lipogenesis. Regulation of FAS is mainly at the transcriptional level.

Cell Biol. 2006; 7: 85-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (1898) Google Scholar), to bind the FAS promoter is critical for feeding/insulin response, SREBP-1c itself cannot bind its SRE without being recruited by USF, which is constitutively bound to the −65 E box (Griffin et al., 2007Griffin M.J. Wong R.H. Pandya N. Sul H.S. Direct interaction between USF and SREBP-1c mediates synergistic activation of the fatty-acid synthase promoter.J. Biol.

Biol. 2003; 23: 5896-5907Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Many of the lipogenic promoters contain closely spaced E box and SRE at the proximal promoter region, and we documented a similar mechanism for activation of FAS and mGPAT promoters (Griffin et al., 2007Griffin M.J. Wong R.H. Pandya N. Sul H.S. Direct interaction between USF and SREBP-1c mediates synergistic activation of the fatty-acid synthase promoter.J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 5453-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Thus, USF, along with SREBP-1c, play a critical role in mediating the transcriptional activation of lipogenesis in response to feeding/insulin. The requirement of USF in induction of lipogenic genes, such as FAS, has been demonstrated in USF-deficient mice (Casado et al., 1999Casado M. Vallet V.S. Kahn A. Vaulont S. Essential role in vivo of upstream stimulatory factors for a normal dietary response of the fatty acid synthase gene in the liver.J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2009-2013Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). In humans, SNP studies have implicated USF-1 as a prime candidate of familial combined hyperlipidemia (FCHL) (Pajukanta et al., 2004Pajukanta P. Lilja H.E. Sinsheimer J.S. Cantor R.M. Lusis A.J. Gentile M. Duan X.J. Soro-Paavonen A. Naukkarinen J. Saarela J. et al.Familial combined hyperlipidemia is associated with upstream transcription factor 1 (USF1).Nat. Genet. 2004; 36: 371-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). How does USF regulate lipogenic gene transcription? USF levels do not change during fasting/feeding, and it is constitutively bound to the FAS promoter in both conditions (Wang and Sul, 1995Wang D. Sul H.S. Upstream stimulatory factors bind to insulin response sequence of the fatty acid synthase promoter. USF1 is regulated.J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28716-28722Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). It is possible that posttranslational modifications of USF underlie its function during fasting/feeding. Insulin regulates metabolism primarily through protein phosphorylation by the well-characterized PI3K cascades (Engelman et al., 2006Engelman J.A. Luo J. Cantley L.C. The evolution of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases as regulators of growth and metabolism.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2006; 7: 606-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (2270) Google Scholar). Many of the metabolic effects of insulin are also mediated by protein dephosphorylation catalyzed mainly by protein phosphatase-1 (PP1) (Brady and Saltiel, 2001Brady M.J. Saltiel A.R. The role of protein phosphatase-1 in insulin action.Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 2001; 56: 157-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). In this regard, USF has been previously reported to be phosphorylated by various kinases (Corre and Galibert, 2005Corre S. Galibert M.D. Upstream stimulating factors: Highly versatile stress-responsive transcription factors.Pigment Cell Res. 2005; 18: 337-348Crossref Scopus (191) Google Scholar). However, the significance of USF phosphorylation in lipogenic gene transcription during feeding/insulin is not known. Moreover, USF may not independently function to regulate transcription but recruit coactivators/corepressors. Such recruited factors may also include signaling molecules that transduce extracellular signals to bring about covalent modifications of USF. Thus, it can be postulated that USF and/or its potentially recruited cofactors need to be regulated by dynamic modifications such as phosphorylation/dephosphorylation in response to feeding/insulin. Here, we report a novel mechanism for the sensing of nutritional/hormonal status by USF to regulate lipogenic gene transcription. We demonstrate that USF-1 phosphorylation by DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK), which is first dephosphorylated/activated by PP1, is an immediate response to feeding/insulin treatment. Phosphorylation of USF-1 also allows recruitment and acetylation by p300 associated factor (P/CAF). In contrast, during fasting, USF-1 association with histone deacetylase 9 (HDAC9) leads to USF-1 deacetylation. Thus, upon feeding, DNA-PK-deficient SCID mice show impaired USF-1 phosphorylation/acetylation, DNA break, transcriptional activation of the FAS gene, and lipogenesis. Our present study shows that DNA-PK is critical for the feeding-dependent activation of lipogenic genes, linking DNA-PK to the insulin-signaling pathway. We have previously shown that USF is required for the regulation of FAS promoter activity in fasting/feeding (Wang and Sul, 1995Wang D. Sul H.S.

Chem. 1995; 270: 28716-28722Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, Wang and Sul, 1997Wang D. Sul H.S.

Chem. 1997; 272: 26367-26374Crossref Scopus (123) Google Scholar). However, USF is constitutively bound to the FAS promoter (Griffin et al., 2007Griffin M.J. Wong R.H. Pandya N. Sul H.S. Direct interaction between USF and SREBP-1c mediates synergistic activation of the fatty-acid synthase promoter.J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 5453-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, Latasa et al., 2003Latasa M.J. Griffin M.J. Moon Y.S. Kang C. Sul H.S.

Biol. 2003; 23: 5896-5907Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). We postulated that USF may repress or activate the FAS promoter by recruiting distinct cofactors in fasted and fed conditions. We performed tandem affinity purification (TAP) and mass spectrometry (MS) analysis. The USF-interacting proteins were purified from nuclear extracts prepared from 293 cells overexpressing USF-1 tagged with streptavidin and calmodulin-binding peptides (TAP tagged) as well as a FLAG epitope at its carboxyl terminus. In addition to USF-1 and USF-2, we identified seven polypeptides in the eluates by MS analysis (Figure 1A, left panel and Table S2 available online). These proteins fall into three categories: (1) DNA break/repair components DNA-PK and its regulatory subunits, Ku70, Ku80, as well as poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1) and Topoisomerase IIß (TopoIIβ), (2) protein phosphatase PP1, and (3) P/CAF, which belongs to the histone acetyltransferases (HAT) family. Interestingly, we detected some of the USF-interacting proteins to be poly(ADP-ribosyl)ated (Figure S5E). TAP using cells that were first crosslinked by DSP showed identical USF-1-interacting proteins (data not shown).Figure 1Purification of USF-1-Interacting ProteinsShow full caption(A) The identities (far left) of USF-1-associated polypeptides.

We detected at least five of the polypeptides having molecular weights corresponding to the above identified proteins by silver staining of the TAP eluates separated by SDS-PAGE (Figure 1A, second left panel). Blue native (BN) gel electrophoresis of the TAP eluates revealed the presence of a large USF-1-containing complex (Figure S1B). Immunoblotting of the eluates using antibodies against each of the seven polypeptides further confirmed the presence of all seven polypeptides that were copurified with TAP-tagged USF-1 (Figure 1A, third left panel). These identified proteins were specific to USF-1 because none of them were found with the control TAP tag. Confirming USF-1 interaction, coimmunoprecipitation followed by immunoblotting revealed the presence of all interacting proteins in endogenous USF-1 immunoprecipitates (Figure 1A, second right panel). Furthermore, GST pull-down assay showed that DNA-PK and PARP-1, but not TopoIIβ, Ku70/Ku80, and PP1, can directly interact with USF-1 (Figure S1A). We also attempted to purify and identify USF-interacting proteins by incubating liver nuclear extracts with bacterially expressed TAP-tagged USF immobilized on agarose beads. MS analysis identified an additional USF-interacting protein HDAC9, a transcriptional corepressor that belongs to the class II HDAC family, which was copurified with USF-1 when the nuclear extracts from fasted mice were used (data not shown). The interaction between HDAC9 and USF-1 was confirmed by detection of HDAC9 copurified with USF-1 by TAP in cells overexpressing HDAC9 and USF-1 (Figure 1A, right panel). Overall, except for P/CAF, which has been implicated to function with USF for histone modification in chromosomal silencing (West et al., 2004West A.G. Huang S. Gaszner M. Litt M.D. Felsenfeld G. Recruitment of histone modifications by USF proteins at a vertebrate barrier element.Mol. Cell. 2004; 16: 453-463Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar), none of the above proteins have previously been shown to interact with USF. All of the USF-interacting proteins were expressed in lipogenic tissues, liver, and white adipose tissue (WAT) (Figure 1B). We next performed ChIP in livers of fasted and fed transgenic mice expressing a CAT reporter gene driven by the −444 FAS promoter, a minimal FAS promoter sufficient for full response to fasting/feeding and diabetes/insulin treatments (Latasa et al., 2000Latasa M.J. Moon Y.S. Kim K.H. Sul H.S.

Two 5′-regions are required for nutritional and insulin regulation of the fatty-acid synthase promoter in transgenic mice.J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10121-10127Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). As shown before, we detected binding of USF in both fasted and fed conditions (Figure 1C, left panel). In the fasted state, however, we detected the corepressor HDAC9 bound to the FAS promoter, but not other interacting proteins that we identified by TAP-MS. Upon feeding, HDAC9 was no longer bound to the promoter, but the FAS promoter was now occupied by the coactivator P/CAF, DNA break/repair components that include DNA-PK, Ku70/80, PARP-1, TopoIIβ, as well as PP1 (Figure 1C, left panel). We also performed ChIP analysis of the mGPAT promoter using antibodies against proteins that represent each of the three categories of the USF-interacting proteins. Similar to what we observed with the FAS promoter, USF-1 was bound to the mGPAT promoter in both fasted and fed conditions (Figure 1C, right panel). Furthermore, as seen with the FAS promoter, HDAC9 was bound to the mGPAT promoter only in fasting, whereas DNA-PK, PPI, and P/CAF were bound only in the fed state. We also verified the regulated expression of FAS and mGPAT in these mice. As predicted, FAS and mGPAT mRNA levels were very low in livers of fasted mice, but upon feeding, they were induced drastically to ∼50- and 25-fold, respectively (Figure 1D). The similar binding pattern of USF-interacting proteins suggests a common mechanism for lipogenic induction involving USF and its interacting proteins in response to feeding. Overall, USF-1 is constitutively bound to the FAS and other lipogenic promoters in both metabolic states, whereas USF-interacting proteins are bound in a fasting/feeding-dependent manner. We next investigated whether this is due to the differential interaction of USF with these proteins by employing insulin-responsive HepG2 cells overexpressing USF-1. The levels of various USF-interacting proteins in HepG2 cells were similar when cells were cultured in the presence or absence of insulin (Figure S1D). As shown in Figure 1E, in insulin-treated cells, USF-1 preferentially coimmunoprecipitated with those proteins that were found to be bound to the lipogenic promoters in the fed condition, whereas in the absence of insulin, USF-1 preferentially interacted with HDAC9. To further address whether the binding of the various interacting proteins to the FAS promoter is USF dependent, we performed ChIP in transgenic mice containing CAT driven by the −444 FAS promoter with a specific mutation at the USF-binding site of −65 E box (−444 (−65 m)). We have previously shown that, due to the loss of the critical −65 E box where USF binds, the −444 (−65 m) FAS promoter does not have any activity, although the promoter contains an additional USF-binding site at −332 (Latasa et al., 2003Latasa M.J. Griffin M.J. Moon Y.S. Kang C. Sul H.S. Occupancy and function of the −150 sterol regulatory element and −65 E-box in nutritional regulation of the fatty acid synthase gene in living animals.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 5896-5907Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). We did not detect binding of any of the USF-1-interacting proteins to this FAS promoter containing the −65 E box mutation, even though USF-1 was bound to the −332 E box in both fasted and fed states (Figure 1F, left panel). Furthermore, siRNA-mediated knockdown of USF-1 prevented recruitment of the USF-1-interacting proteins to the wild-type FAS promoter (Figure 1F, right panel). Taken together, these data clearly demonstrate the requirement of USF-1 binding to the −65 E box for recruitment of various proteins to the FAS promoter. Because USF binding to the E box is necessary for SREBP binding to the nearby SRE in lipogenic promoters and USF and SREBP-1 directly interact for promoter activation (Latasa et al., 2003Latasa M.J. Griffin M.J. Moon Y.S. Kang C. Sul H.S. Occupancy and function of the −150 sterol regulatory element and −65 E-box in nutritional regulation of the fatty acid synthase gene in living animals.Mol.

Direct interaction between USF and SREBP-1c mediates synergistic activation of the fatty-acid synthase promoter.J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 5453-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), we examined whether the binding of the USF-1-interacting proteins to the FAS promoter is dependent on the SREBP-1 binding to SRE. We performed ChIP in transgenic mice containing CAT driven by the −444 FAS promoter with a specific mutation at the −150SRE (−444 (−150 m)). As shown in Figure 1G, we could not detect recruitment of the various interacting proteins to the FAS promoter containing the −150 SRE mutation during feeding. Similar results were observed in HepG2 cells when transfected with −444 (−150 m) FAS-Luc or SREBP-1 siRNA (Figures S2A and S2B), correlating with the diminished FAS promoter activation (Figure S2E). As a control, we examined the p53 promoter, which has a proximal E box but does not respond to feeding/insulin (Figures S1C and S2D). Upon insertion of an artificial SRE, the p53 promoter was activated by USF-1 recruiting various interacting proteins in response to insulin (Figures S2D and S2E), demonstrating that nearby SRE is critical for USF-1 to recruit various interacting proteins. As shown, the components of DNA break/repair machinery were recruited to the FAS promoter in fed state. In this regard, it has recently been reported that a transient DNA break is required for estrogen receptor-regulated transcription (Ju et al., 2006Ju B.G. Lunyak V.V. Perissi V. Garcia-Bassets I. Rose D.W. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. A topoisomerase IIbeta-mediated dsDNA break required for regulated transcription.Science. 2006; 312: 1798-1802Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar). By end labeling using biotin-UTP and subsequent ChIP, we clearly detected DNA breaks in the −444 FAS-CAT as well as the endogenous FAS promoters after 3 hr of feeding, a time point when binding of DNA-PK and TopoIIβ was detected (Figure 1H). The observed DNA breaks in the FAS promoter region preceded the maximal FAS transcription that occurs 6 hr after the start of feeding (Paulauskis and Sul, 1989Paulauskis J.D. Sul H.S. Hormonal regulation of mouse fatty acid synthase gene transcription in liver.J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 574-577Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Constitutive binding of USF-1, despite its differential recruitments during fasting/feeding, prompted us to investigate whether USF-1 is posttranslationally modified. We immunoprecipitated USF-1 from liver nuclear extracts of fasted or fed mice and performed MS analysis. Notably, we detected a phosphoserine residue at the S262 of USF-1 only in nuclear extracts from fed mice. We detected higher S262 phosphorylation of USF-1 in the fed state than in the fasted state (Figure 2A, panel 2) using antibodies against a USF-1 peptide containing phosphorylated S262 (referred to as anti-P-USF-1) that we generated. ChIP analysis of the FAS-CAT promoter using anti-P-USF-1 showed that this specific phosphoUSF-1 occupied the FAS promoter only in the fed state, even though USF-1 occupancy was detected in both fasted and fed conditions (Figure 2B). Similarly, USF-1 bound to the mGPAT promoter was phosphorylated at S262 in fed state (Figure S5D). To test the functional significance of this S262 phosphorylation, we expresse"
https://openalex.org/W2155384593,"Fragment screens have successfully identified new scaffolds in drug discovery, often with relatively high hit rates (5%) using small screening libraries (1,000-10,000 compounds). This raises two questions: would other noteworthy chemotypes be found were one to screen all commercially available fragments (>300,000), and does the success rate imply low specificity of fragments? We used molecular docking to screen large libraries of fragments against CTX-M beta-lactamase. We identified ten millimolar-range inhibitors from the 69 compounds tested. The docking poses corresponded closely to the crystallographic structures subsequently determined. Notably, these initial low-affinity hits showed little specificity between CTX-M and an unrelated beta-lactamase, AmpC, which is unusual among beta-lactamase inhibitors. This is consistent with the idea that the high hit rates among fragments correlate to a low initial specificity. As the inhibitors were progressed, both specificity and affinity rose together, yielding to our knowledge the first micromolar-range noncovalent inhibitors against a class A beta-lactamase."
https://openalex.org/W2149326807,"The breast cancer susceptibility protein, BRCA2, is essential for recombinational DNA repair. BRCA2 delivers RAD51 to double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) breaks through interaction with eight conserved, approximately 35 amino acid motifs, the BRC repeats. Here we show that the solitary BRC4 promotes assembly of RAD51 onto single-stranded DNA (ssDNA), but not dsDNA, to stimulate DNA strand exchange. BRC4 acts by blocking ATP hydrolysis and thereby maintaining the active ATP-bound form of the RAD51-ssDNA filament. Single-molecule visualization shows that BRC4 does not disassemble RAD51-dsDNA filaments but rather blocks nucleation of RAD51 onto dsDNA. Furthermore, this behavior is manifested by a domain of BRCA2 comprising all eight BRC repeats. These results establish that the BRC repeats modulate RAD51-DNA interaction in two opposing but functionally reinforcing ways: targeting active RAD51 to ssDNA and prohibiting RAD51 nucleation onto dsDNA. Thus, BRCA2 recruits RAD51 to DNA breaks and, we propose, the BRC repeats regulate DNA-binding selectivity."

We investigated whether the retinoid cycle (i.e. the series of biochemical reactions required for vision through continuous generation of 11-cis-retinal and clearance of all-trans-retinal, respectively) might be involved. Previously, we reported that mice lacking two enzymes responsible for clearing all-trans-retinal, namely photoreceptor-specific ABCA4 (ATP-binding cassette transporter 4) and RDH8 (retinol dehydrogenase 8), manifested retinal abnormalities exacerbated by light and associated with accumulation of diretinoid-pyridinium-ethanolamine (A2E), a condensation product of all-trans-retinal and a surrogate marker for toxic retinoids. Now we show that these mice develop an acute, light-induced retinopathy.

No significant ocular accumulation of A2E occurred under these conditions. These results indicate that this acute light-induced retinopathy requires the presence of free all-trans-retinal and not, as generally believed, A2E or other retinoid condensation products.

Patients affected by age-related macular degeneration, Stargardt disease, or other retinal diseases associated with accumulation of surrogate markers, such as A2E, all develop retinal degeneration (12Allikmets R. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2000; 67: 487-491Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Thus, elucidating the fundamental causes of these age-dependent changes is of increasing importance. Encouragingly, our understanding of both retinoid metabolism outside the eye and production of 11-cis-retinal unique to the eye has accelerated recently (Scheme 1) (1Travis G.H. Golczak M. Moise A.R. Palczewski K. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2007; 47: 469-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar, 2McBee J.K. Palczewski K. Baehr W. Pepperberg D.R.

Eye Res. 2003; 22: 683-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), and genetic mouse models are readily available to study these processes and their potential aberrations in vivo (13Baehr W. Wu S.M. Bird A.C. Palczewski K. Vision Res. 2003; 43: 2957-2958Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Thus, a central question can be addressed, namely what initiates the death of photoreceptor cells and the underlining RPE? Several mechanisms associated with retinoid metabolism may contribute to different retinopathies (1Travis G.H. Golczak M. Moise A.R. Palczewski K. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2007; 47: 469-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). For example, lack of retinoids in LRAT (lecithin:retinol acyltransferase) or chromophore in retinoid isomerase knock-out (Rpe65-/-) mice leads to rapid degeneration of cone photoreceptors and slowly progressive death of rods (14Rohrer B. Lohr H.R. Humphries P. Redmond T.M. Seeliger M.W. Crouch R.K. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2005; 46: 3876-3882Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Such mice do not produce toxic condensation products from all-trans-retinal. Instead, their retinopathies have been attributed to continuous activation of visual phototransduction (15Fan J. Woodruff M.L. Cilluffo M.C. Crouch R.K. Fain G.L. J. Physiol. 2005; 568: 83-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) due to either the basal activity of opsin (16Hofmann K.P. Pulvermuller A.

Rohrer B. Palczewski K. Frederick J.M. Crouch R.K. Baehr W. J. Neurosci. 2008; 28: 4008-4014Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Paradoxically, an abnormally high flux of retinoids through the retinoid cycle can also lead to retinopathy in other mouse models (20Maeda A. Maeda T. Imanishi Y. Sun W. Jastrzebska B. Hatala D.A. Winkens H.J. Hofmann K.P. Janssen J.J. Baehr W. Driessen C.A. Palczewski K. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 37697-37704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 21Wenzel A.

Animal models featuring anomalies in the retinoid cycle illustrate the importance of chromophore regeneration and provide an approach to elucidating mechanisms involved in human retinal dysfunction and disease. Recently, we showed that mice carrying a double knock-out of Rdh8 (retinol dehydrogenase 8), one of the main enzymes that reduces all-trans-retinal in rod and cone outer segments (22Rattner A. Smallwood P.M. Nathans J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11034-11043Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar), and Abca4 (ATP-binding cassette transporter 4), which transports all-trans-retinal from the inside to the outside of disc membranes (23Molday R.S. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 2007; 39: 507-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), rapidly accumulate all-trans-retinal condensation products and exhibit accentuated RPE/photoreceptor dystrophy at an early age (24Maeda A. Maeda T. Golczak M. Palczewski K. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 26684-26693Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Although these studies suggest retinoid toxicity, it is still unclear if the elevated levels of retinal and/or its condensation products, such as A2E, are the cause of this retinopathy or merely a nonspecific reflection of impaired retinoid metabolism. Here, we report that spent chromophore, all-trans-retinal, is most likely responsible for photoreceptor degeneration in Rdh8-/-Abca4-/- mice. Toxic effects of all-trans-retinal include caspase activation and mitochondria-associated cell death. Animals—Lrat-/-Rdh8-/-Abca4-/- triple knock-out mice were generated by cross-breeding Rdh8-/-Abca4-/- mice with Lrat-/- mice, and progeny were genotyped as previously described (24Maeda A. Maeda T.

Gnat1-/-Rdh8-/-Abca4-/- triple knock-out mice were generated by cross-breeding Rdh8-/-Abca4-/- mice with Gnat1-/- mice, and progeny also were genotyped as previously described (24Maeda A. Maeda T.

Mice with the Leu residue variant at amino acid position 450 of RPE65 (retinal pigment epithelium-specific protein of 65 kDa) were used for this study. Animals were housed in the animal facility at the School of Medicine, Case Western Reserve University, where they were maintained either under complete darkness or in a 12-h light (∼5 lux)/12-h dark cycle environment. Manipulations were done in the dark under dim red light transmitted through a Kodak No. 1 safe light filter (transmittance >560 nm). All animal procedures and experiments were approved by the Case Western Reserve University Animal Care Committees and conformed to recommendations of both the American Veterinary Medical Association Panel on Euthanasia and the Association of Research for Vision and Ophthalmology. Materials and Chemical Syntheses—All-trans-retinoic acid, 13-cis-retinoic acid, 9-cis-retinal, and 9-cis-retinol were purchased from Sigma, and all-trans-retinal was purchased from Toronto Research Chemicals Inc. (Toronto, Canada). 9-cis-Retinyl acetate was prepared from 9-cis-retinol and acetic anhydride by a method previously described (26Batten M.L. Imanishi Y. Tu D.C. Doan T. Zhu L. Pang J. Glushakova L. Moise A.R. Baehr W. Van Gelder R.N. Hauswirth W.W. Rieke F. Palczewski K. PLoS Med. 2005; 2: e333Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). A2E was synthesized by condensation of all-trans-retinal with phosphatidylethanolamine, purified by HPLC, and quantified by UV-visible absorption (28Maeda A. Maeda T. Sun W. Zhang H. Baehr W.

Monnee M.C.F. Mulder P.P.J. Lugtenburg J. Tetrahedron Lett. 1997; 38: 5355-5358Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Specifically, condensation of all-trans-retinal to RALdi was performed in an argon-flushed reaction chamber. 1 mol eq of sodium hydride in mineral oil (60% NaH) was carefully mixed with 1 mol eq of all-trans-retinal delivered in dry tetrahydrofuran. The reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature for 3 h prior to the addition of saturated ammonium chloride and extraction with hexane. The organic layer was washed twice with saturated sodium chloride and dried down in a SpeedVac. The crude product was purified by reverse phase HPLC (Phenomenex C18 column; 250 × 4.60 mm; 5 μm) in an acetonitrile-acetonitrile/isopropyl alcohol (33%/67%, v/v) gradient for 20 min at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. All solvents contained 0.1% formic acid (v/v). The RALdi peak was identified by its characteristic UV-visible spectrum with maxima at 293 and 432 nm. The identity of the compound was further confirmed by LC/MS using a LXQ mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA) equipped with an APCI source under chromatographic conditions described above. To obtain oxidized forms of RALdi, the compound was redissolved in acetonitrile and incubated at room temperature in daylight for 2 h. Formation of oxo-RALdi species was indicated by a shorter retention time on a reverse phase column, a hypochromic shift in the UV-visible absorbance spectra characteristic of losing conjugated double bonds, and a +16, +32 molecular mass shift. Retinoid and A2E Analyses—All experimental procedures related to extraction, derivatization, and separation of retinoids from dissected mouse eyes were carried out as formerly described (32Maeda A. Maeda T. Imanishi Y. Kuksa V. Alekseev A. Bronson J.D. Zhang H. Zhu L. Sun W. Saperstein D.A. Rieke F. Baehr W. Palczewski K. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 18822-18832Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). A2E was extracted twice with 1 ml of acetonitrile from two eyes processed with a glass/glass homogenizer. After solvent evaporation, residues were dissolved in 150 μl of acetonitrile with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (v/v) and filtered through a Teflon syringe filter (National Scientific Co.). Samples (100 μl) were loaded on C18 columns (250 × 4.60 mm; 5 μm) (Phenomenex) and analyzed by normal phase HPLC with gradients of acetonitrile/H2O (80:20) and acetonitrile/H2O (100:0) with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (v/v/v) as the mobile phase for 30 min. Quantification of A2E was performed by comparison with known concentrations of pure synthetic A2E (32Maeda A. Maeda T. Imanishi Y. Kuksa V. Alekseev A. Bronson J.D. Zhang H. Zhu L. Sun W. Saperstein D.A. Rieke F. Baehr W. Palczewski K. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 18822-18832Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Oxidized A2E was detected and quantified with a LXQ mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA) equipped with an APCI source and combined with an 1100 series HPLC (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) (28Maeda A.

Histology and Immunohistochemistry—Histological and immunohistochemical procedures employed were previously reported (33Maeda T. Lem J. Palczewski K. Haeseleer F. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2005; 46: 4320-4327Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Briefly, eyecups for histology were fixed in 2% glutaraldehyde, 4% paraformaldehyde and processed for embedding in Epon. Sections for routine histology were cut at 1 μm and stained with toluidine blue. For immunocytochemistry, eyes were immersion-fixed for 2 h with freshly prepared 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, and processed for optimal cutting temperature (Miles) embedding. Sections cut at 10 μm were viewed through a Zeiss LSM 510 inverted laser scan confocal microscope. TUNEL staining was done according to methods provided by the manufacturer (Chemicon). ERG—All ERG procedures were performed by well established methods (32Maeda A. Maeda T. Imanishi Y. Kuksa V. Alekseev A. Bronson J.D. Zhang H. Zhu L. Sun W. Saperstein D.A. Rieke F. Baehr W.

Briefly, mice under a safety light were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of 20 μl/g body weight of 6 mg/ml ketamine and 0.44 mg/ml xylazine diluted with 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.2, containing 100 mm NaCl. Pupils were dilated with 1% tropicamide. A contact lens electrode was placed on the eye, and a reference electrode and ground electrode were positioned on the ear and tail, respectively. ERGs were recorded with the universal testing and electrophysiologic system, UTAS E-3000 (LKC Technologies, Inc.). Single Flash Recording—White light flash stimuli had a range of intensities from -3.7 to 1.6 log cd·s/m2, and flash duration was adjusted according to intensity from 20 μs to 1 ms. 3-5 recordings were made at sufficient intervals (from 10 s to 10 min) between flash stimuli to allow mice to recover. Light Damage—After dark adaptation for 24 h, one or two mice with pupils dilated by 1% tropicamide were exposed to fluorescent light (10,000 lux) (150-watt spiral lamp; Commercial Electric) for the indicated times in a white bucket (Papersmith, San Marcos, TX) with food and water and then kept in the dark. Quantification of A2E and oxidized A2E in mouse eyes was done at 0 min, 24 h, and 3 days after light illumination, whereas histological analyses of the retina were performed 1 week after such exposure. Illumination of 9-cis-Retinyl Acetate-gavaged Mice—Mice were gavaged with 2 mg of 9-cis-retinyl acetate and kept for 3 days in the dark. Then they were exposed to intense constant illumination (500 cd·m-2) for 24 min. After 24 h of dark adaptation, this procedure was repeated up to three times. Viability Assay of Retinoid-laden ARPE19 and HEK293 Cells—Retinoid-laden ARPE19 cells (human RPE cells) and HEK293 cells (human renal epithelial cells) were produced by the methods described in Refs. 34Sparrow J.R.

Cells (3 × 105 cells in 24-well plates) were incubated for 16 h at 37 °C with a 30 μm concentration of the indicated retinoids, followed by 3 days of incubation with 1 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 10% fetal bovine serum alone. Cells then were either exposed or not exposed to blue light (440 nm; X-Cite120 Fluorescence illumination system with 440-nm filters) for 5 min, and 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assays were performed after 16 h of additional incubation in the dark. For the MTT assay, 50 μl of MTT solution (2 mg/ml in DMEM) was added to each well. After a 16-h incubation, the medium was aspirated; next, intracellular formazan dye crystals were dissolved with 1 ml of DMSO at room temperature in the dark. The absorbance of formazan at 560 nm was measured using a Cary 50 UV-visible spectrophotometer (Varian). In Vitro Calcium Monitoring—Fluo-3 AM (Invitrogen) at 2 μm was loaded onto ARPE19 cells cultured in 24-well plates (1 × 105 cells/well) in DMEM with 10% fetal calf serum. After a 30-min incubation, cells were washed three times with DMEM. All-trans-retinal or calcium ionophore A23187 (Sigma) was added to these cells at the indicated concentrations, and the intracellular calcium concentration was monitored with a Leica DMI 6000 B inverted microscope. Caspase Activity—Cells in 6-cm dishes (6 × 105 cells/3 ml/dish) were cultured at 37 °C in 10% fetal calf serum in DMEM to which either all-trans-retinal (30 μm) or staurosporin (STS; 100 nm) was added. After a 24-h incubation at 37 °C, both floating and adhering cells were collected for caspase activity determinations, as previously reported (36Deveraux Q.L. Takahashi R. Salvesen G.S. Reed J.C. Nature. 1997; 388: 300-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (1707) Google Scholar). Cells were lysed in CHAPS cell lysis buffer (1% CHAPS in 137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 4.3 Na2HPO4, 1.4 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.4), and the soluble fraction was collected after centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 30 min (Eppendorf microcentrifuge). Caspase activity was detected by cleavage of the fluorescent caspase substrate, DEVD-7-amino-4-trifluoromethylcoumarin, as previously reported (36Deveraux Q.L. Takahashi R. Salvesen G.S. Reed J.C. Nature. 1997; 388: 300-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (1707) Google Scholar), after incubation with cell lysates (30 μg of protein) for 30 min at 37 °C. Lactate Dehydrogenase Activity—Cells were cultured in 24-well plates (6 × 104 cells/300 μl/well), and all-trans-retinal (30 μm) was added to the medium with and without various concentrations of cell death inhibitors (caspase inhibitor, Z-VAD-fluoromethyl ketone) or Bax-inhibiting peptide (BIP), as indicated in the legends to Figs. 7 and 9. To examine the role of caspase and Bax in all-trans-retinal-induced cell death, we preincubated cells with either z-VAD-fluoromethyl ketone or BIP for 3 or 12 h, respectively. Then all-trans-retinal was added, and incubation continued for 16 h before collection of media. Activity of lactate dehydrogenase released from dead cells was measured with a lactate dehydrogenase assay kit from Bio-Vision (Mountain View, CA).FIGURE 9All-trans-retinal induces caspase- and Bax-dependent cell apoptosis. A, ARPE19 cells were incubated with 100 nm STS or 30 μm all-trans-retinal (atRAL) for 24 h at 37 °C, and caspase activity was measured by detecting cleavage of the fluorescent caspase substrate, DEVD-7-amino-4-trifluoromethylcoumarin. B, the caspase inhibitor, Z-VAD-fluoromethyl ketone (Z-VAD) (200 μm), was added together with 100 nm STS or 30 μm all-trans-retinal to ARPE19 cells and incubated for 24 h at 37 °C. ARPE19 cell toxicity was assessed by lactate dehydrogenase release. C, caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-fluoromethyl ketone and Bax inhibitor (BIP) were admixed at the indicated concentrations with culture medium containing 30 μm all-trans-retinal. ARPE19 cell cytotoxicity was assessed by lactate dehydrogenase measurements after a 16-h incubation at 37 °C.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Mitochondrial Oxidative Phosphorylation—Cardiac interfibrillar mitochondria were isolated from Sprague-Dawley rats using a protocol reported by Palmer et al. (37Palmer J.W. Tandler B. Hoppel C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 8731-8739Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Cardiac interfibrillar mitochondria were separated by treating minced cardiac muscle with modified Chappel-Perry buffer (50 mm MOPS, pH 7.4, containing 100 mm KCl, 5.0 mm MgSO4, 1.0 mm EGTA, and 1.0 mm ATP) followed by homogenization in a loose then tight fitting Potter-Elvehjem Teflon-glass apparatus. After centrifugation (10 min at 2200 rpm twice and 10 min at 5000 rpm) to isolate the subsarcolemmal mitochondria, the cardiac interfibrillar mitochondria were extracted after treatment with trypsin (5 mg/ml), homogenization, and centrifugation (10 min at 5000 rpm twice). Mitochondrial pellets then were suspended in 50 mm MOPS, pH 7.4, containing 100 mm KCl and 0.5 mm EGTA, and protein analysis was performed using the Lowry assay. Oxidative phosphorylation of mitochondria was used to assess integrated mitochondrial function. Oxygen consumption of isolated cardiac interfibrillar mitochondria was measured in three separate experiments with a Clark-type oxygen electrode immersed in 50 mm MOPS, pH 7.4, containing 100 mm KCl, 1.0 mm EGTA, 5.0 mm K3PO4, and 1.0 mg/ml bovine serum albumin with 20 mm glutamate as substrate. State 3 respiration was measured after the addition of 180 μm ADP, and state 4 was measured upon ADP depletion. Respiratory control ratios reflecting the coupling of oxidation with phosphorylation were determined as ratios of state 3 respiration/state 4 respiration. Dinitrophenol (0.2 mm) was added to measure uncoupled respiration (38Hoppel C.L. Tomec R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 832-841Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Rdh8-/-Abca4-/- mice exposed to a 12-h dark/12-h light (∼5 lux) cycle exhibited progressive severe retinal degeneration (Fig. 1A). The photoreceptor layer thinned to 4-6 rows of disorganized cells in 5-month-old mice and was absent in 12-month-old animals. Retinal degeneration under a normal 12-h dark/12-h light cycle was not obvious by the age of 4-6 weeks in these mice, but the same 4-week-old strain displayed acute severe retinal degeneration after exposure to bright light (Fig. 1B). Rod and cone photoreceptor cell death was observed in Rdh8-/-Abca4-/- mice illuminated at 10,000 lux for 15 min, whereas no degeneration was evident in wild type (WT) mice, even after 60 min of illumination (Fig. 1C). Photoreceptor cell death was detected promptly after light exposure, and a large number of photoreceptor cells were TUNEL-positive at 24 h after 10,000-lux light exposure for 60 min (Fig. 1D). Because rapid retinal degeneration was observed immediately after bright light exposure, we speculated that light-sensitive compounds within the eye might trigger this pathology. One such compound that accumulates in the eyes of Rdh8-/--Abca4-/- mice is A2E (24Maeda A. Maeda T. Golczak M. Palczewski K. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 26684-26693Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar), and toxicity of oxidized A2E produced by light has been suggested as well (39Sparrow J.R. Zhou J.

A similarly potent DNA repair capacity is shared by small aquatic desiccation and ionizing radiation-resistant animals, the bdelloid rotifers (Gladyshev and Meselson, 2008Gladyshev E. Meselson M. Extreme resistance of bdelloid rotifers to ionizing radiation.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2008; 105: 5139-5144Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). A high genome copy number may facilitate recombinational repair of double-strand breaks (Hansen, 1978Hansen M.T. Multiplicity of genome equivalents in the radiation-resistant bacterium Micrococcus radiodurans.J. Bacteriol. 1978; 134: 71-75PubMed Google Scholar, Harsojo et al., 1981Harsojo Kitayama S. Matsuyama A. Genome multiplicity and radiation resistance in Micrococcus radiodurans.J. Biochem. 1981; 90: 877-880PubMed Google Scholar), whereas a condensed genome is expected to restrict diffusion of DNA fragments (Levin-Zaidman et al., 2003Levin-Zaidman S. Englander J. Shimoni E.

Microbiol. 2001; 39: 286-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) further contribute to D. radiodurans' robustness. D. radiodurans also displays many protective features against oxygen free radical damage to proteins and nucleic acids. Carotenoids function as scavengers of radiation-induced reactive oxygen species (Tian et al., 2007Tian B. Xu Z. Sun Z. Lin J. Hua Y.

Arguably, the extreme radiation resistance of D. radiodurans is due to the synergistic effects of efficient protection from macromolecular damage and potent DNA repair enhanced by functional redundancies in both systems. D. radiodurans survives 7 kGy of ionizing radiation with marginal lethality (10%). This dose shatters its 3.28 Mb genome into 20–30 kb fragments by introducing 100–150 double-strand breaks (∼0.02 DSBs/Gy/genome) and, presumably, at least 10 times as many single-strand breaks. After this dose follows a 1.5 hr period during which DNA is progressively degraded, and neither significant DNA repair nor DNA synthesis take place (Zahradka et al., 2006Zahradka K. Slade D. Bailone A. Sommer S. Averbeck D. Petranovic M. Lindner A.B. Radman M. Reassembly of shattered chromosomes in Deinococcus radiodurans.Nature. 2006; 443: 569-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). However, in the following hour, the genome is fully reassembled in parallel with massive DNA synthesis. It was proposed that the reassembly of the fragmented chromosomes proceeds through a two-step mechanism requiring DNA polymerase I (Pol I)-dependent DNA synthesis and RecA-dependent recombination processes (Zahradka et al., 2006Zahradka K. Slade D. Bailone A. Sommer S. Averbeck D. Petranovic M. Lindner A.B. Radman M. Reassembly of shattered chromosomes in Deinococcus radiodurans.Nature. 2006; 443: 569-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). In the first step, called extended synthesis-dependent strand annealing (ESDSA), recessed chromosomal fragments with overlapping homologies prime synthesis on complementary strands of overlapping fragments, generating newly synthesized single strands extending from the double-stranded core. Subsequent annealing of complementary single strands produces a duplex of newly synthesized DNA that assembles colinear fragments into long linear intermediates. Such intermediates are matured by RecA-dependent crossovers into circular chromosomes that are patchworks of old (synthesized before irradiation) and new (synthesized after irradiation) DNA blocks. D. radiodurans polA mutants are highly sensitive to ionizing radiation (Gutman et al., 1993Gutman P.D. Fuchs P. Ouyang L. Minton K.W. Identification, sequencing, and targeted mutagenesis of a DNA polymerase gene required for the extreme radioresistance of Deinococcus radiodurans.J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 3581-3590Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and show a substantial defect in DNA synthesis and repair, indicating that ESDSA-associated massive DNA synthesis requires Pol I (Zahradka et al., 2006Zahradka K. Slade D. Bailone A. Sommer S. Averbeck D. Petranovic M. Lindner A.B. Radman M. Reassembly of shattered chromosomes in Deinococcus radiodurans.Nature. 2006; 443: 569-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). Pol I could itself catalyze such massive DNA resynthesis, initiate single-strand elongation further catalyzed by DNA polymerase III (Pol III), or contribute only to the maintenance of fragments (e.g., by providing the short-patch repair synthesis for base excision repair of oxidized bases). In Escherichia coli, Pol I functions primarily to fill DNA gaps that arise during replication, excision repair, and recombination (Kornberg and Baker, 1992Kornberg A. Baker T. DNA Replication.Second edition. W.H. Freeman, New York1992Google Scholar), whereas the Pol III holoenzyme is the essential multiprotein complex that carries out DNA replication (Johnson and O'Donnell, 2005Johnson A. O'Donnell M. Cellular DNA replicases: components and dynamics at the replication fork.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2005; 74: 283-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). In addition to Pol I and Pol III, D. radiodurans also possesses Pol X, a DNA polymerase of the X family, endowed with Mn2+-dependent DNA synthesis and 3′→5′ exonuclease acitivities (Blasius et al., 2006Blasius M. Shevelev I. Jolivet E. Sommer S. Hubscher U. DNA polymerase X from Deinococcus radiodurans possesses a structure-modulated 3′→5′ exonuclease activity involved in radioresistance.Mol. Microbiol. 2006; 60: 165-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). However, Pol X-deficient cells are sensitized to γ rays only at doses exceeding 7 kGy (Lecointe et al., 2004Lecointe F. Shevelev I.V. Bailone A. Sommer S. Hubscher U. Involvement of an X family DNA polymerase in double-stranded break repair in the radioresistant organism Deinococcus radiodurans.Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 53: 1721-1730Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The RecA mutant is among the most radiation-sensitive mutants found in D. radiodurans (Moseley and Copland, 1975Moseley B.E. Copland H.J. Isolation and properties of a recombination-deficient mutant of Micrococcus radiodurans.J. Bacteriol. 1975; 121: 422-428PubMed Google Scholar). RecA promotes DNA strand-exchange reactions, relevant for the repair of stalled replication forks, double-strand break repair, and general recombination (Cox, 2003Cox M.M. The bacterial RecA protein as a motor protein.Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2003; 57: 551-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). In contrast to E. coli RecA, D. radiodurans RecA promotes an inverse DNA strand-exchange reaction, binding the duplex DNA first and the homologous ssDNA substrate second (Kim and Cox, 2002Kim J.I. Cox M.M. The RecA proteins of Deinococcus radiodurans and Escherichia coli promote DNA strand exchange via inverse pathways.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 7917-7921Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Deletion of radA, a recA homolog, confers modest radiation-sensitivity to D. radiodurans (Zhou et al., 2006Zhou Q. Zhang X.J. Xu H. Xu B.J. Hua Y.J. RadA: A protein involved in DNA damage repair processes of Deinococcus radiodurans R1.Chin. Sci. Bull. 2006; 51: 2993-2999Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar). This study was aimed at dissecting the mechanics of ESDSA by identifying the key steps and enzymes involved in ESDSA with emphasis on the DNA repair synthesis. To investigate the role of Pol III and its potential interaction with Pol I in ESDSA, we have engineered thermosensitive dnaE mutants (dnaEts) and found that both Pol I and Pol III activities are essential for recombinational DNA repair in irradiated D. radiodurans. In this process, hundreds of overlapping genomic fragments can be used as respective primers and templates for 3′ end elongations. RecA- and RadA-mediated priming of 3′ end extensions allows Pol III to initiate repair synthesis, whereas Pol I enables efficient elongation of single strands that subsequently anneal by complementarity, thus reassembling intact genomes. The requirement for DNA synthesis in DNA repair of heavily irradiated D. radiodurans was assessed using hydroxyurea (HU). HU presumably arrests all DNA synthesis by inhibiting ribonucleotide reductase, which converts rNDPs into dNDPs, thus preventing the regeneration of dNTP pool via kinase activities (Sinha and Snustad, 1972Sinha N.K. Snustad D.P. Mechanism of inhibition of deoxyribonucleic acid synthesis in Escherichia coli by hydroxyurea.J. Bacteriol. 1972; 112: 1321-1324Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). When nonirradiated D. radiodurans cells were incubated in HU, DNA synthesis and cell division were completely inhibited at 660 mM concentration in the medium, without affecting cell viability upon HU removal (see Figure S1 available online). In 7 kGy-irradiated cells, HU prevented all DNA repair steps: DNA fragment degradation, synthesis, and fragment reassembly (Figure 1). This effect was transient: upon removal of HU at different times after irradiation, the usual extensive DNA fragment degradation, massive DNA synthesis and rapid fragment reassembly were all restored and the repair complete within 3 hr (Figures S2A and S2B). Even after an 8 hr exposure, HU had only a slight effect on the viability of irradiated cells upon its removal (up to 15% survival reduction; Figure S2C). These HU effects highlight the importance of DNA fragment resection and extensive synthesis in deinoccocal DNA repair and cellular survival, such that a significant contribution of any DNA repair mechanism that does not involve extensive DNA synthesis can be excluded, at least at this level of damage. The quantification of DNA repair showed that after 7 kGy γ-radiation, over 90% of the double-stranded DNA fragment mass was lost during the DNA degradation period (Figure 1C). However, when bacterial DNA was prelabeled with radioactive [3H]thymidine before irradiation, the global loss of DNA during the latency period did not exceed 40% (see below; Figure 5B). This suggests that DNA breakdown occurs by exonucleolytic single-strand erosion producing long single-stranded overhangs. This DNA resection is indispensible for DNA synthesis and repair (see below). End-recessed fragments can prime DNA synthesis upon single-strand invasion of overlapping single-stranded or double-stranded (via D-loop formation) templates (Paques and Haber, 1999Paques F. Haber J.E. Multiple pathways of recombination induced by double-strand breaks in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1999; 63: 349-404Crossref PubMed Google Scholar; for illustration, see below; step C in Figure 7). As D-loop formation usually involves RecA-like activities, two such genes, recA and radA, were deleted in D. radiodurans. Figure 2A shows that RecA deficiency impeded DNA synthesis, whereas RadA deficiency reduced it considerably. Consequently, after 7 kGy irradiation, the fragment assembly was delayed for 2 hr in the radA mutant, and the recA mutant failed to reconstitute the entire genome even after 24 hr (as diagnosed by the deficit of the largest NotI fragment in PFGE; Figure 2B). Whereas 7 kGy irradiation reduces the survival of recA to <10−7, the survival of the radA mutant is decreased only 2-fold relative to the wild-type (Figure S3A). A more severe repair defect (Figure 2B) and the higher radiation sensitivity (Figure S3B) of the radA recA double mutant compared with the recA mutant suggest that RadA functions in a different, synthesis-independent pathway in the absence of RecA. In addition, the initial partial degradation of DNA fragments appears less pronounced in the recA mutant, as seen in both the PFGE gels (Figure 2B) and the DNA degradation measurements in the [3H]-prelabeled recA mutant (Figure 2C). Although D. radiodurans polA mutants are radiation sensitive, radiation-induced DNA fragments are eventually reassembled, albeit with a considerable delay dependent on the amount of DNA damage (Figure 3). For instance, following 7 kGy irradiation, DNA repair requires 3 hr in wild-type cells and 15 hr in the polA mutant (Figures 1B and 3B). At lower doses of ionizing radiation, the delay is shorter, but still at least 3× longer than in the wild-type (Figure S4). During this delay in DNA repair, the irradiated polA cells died rapidly in measure with their radiosensitivity, suggesting a futile DNA repair in dead cells. The reappearance of the genomic NotI pattern in the irradiated polA mutant is not a result of the multiplication of rare survivors, as the increase in CFU was manifest only after genome reconstitution was visible in PFGE (Figures 3B and S5). Even in the absence of Pol I, delayed chromosome reassembly coincided with extensive DNA synthesis (albeit less extensive than in the wild-type cells) before the onset of cell division (shown for 2.45 kGy in Figure S6). UV photolysis of DNA in polA cells that have repaired their DNA in BrdU-containing medium resulted in DSBs (Figure 3C). This is indicative of a patchwork structure of old and new DNA blocks, diagnostic of ESDSA. In ESDSA, newly synthesized DNA (containing BrdU) is present in both strands for a given region and is degraded by double-strand breakage after exposure to UV, thus reversing the repair process. Clearly, in addition to Pol I, another DNA polymerase is involved in the ESDSA repair in D. radiodurans, and Pol III is the prime candidate. As Pol III is an essential enzyme, investigation of the effects of Pol III deficiency on DNA repair necessitated the construction of a conditional mutant. Temperature-sensitive (ts) mutation in the dnaE gene (encoding the catalytic subunit of Pol III) was generated by targeting single missense mutations in conserved dnaE codons conferring temperature sensitivity in E. coli (Vandewiele et al., 2002Vandewiele D. Fernandez de Henestrosa A.R. Timms A.R. Bridges B.A. Woodgate R. Sequence analysis and phenotypes of five temperature sensitive mutator alleles of dnaE, encoding modified alpha-catalytic subunits of Escherichia coli DNA polymerase III holoenzyme.Mutat. Res. 2002; 499: 85-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Target codons in D. radiodurans dnaE were mutated in vitro by site-directed mutagenesis, transferred onto the carrier pRAD1 shuttle vector, and transplaced by recombination into the D. radiodurans genomic dnaE locus. This approach allowed for the introduction of single relevant mutations at the three target sites and yielded one ts mutant incorporating the dnaE1035 mutation that was characterized and used in DNA repair experiments. This is the first ts mutation obtained by gene engineering in D. radiodurans. (The construction and characterization of thermosensitive mutants is described in the Supplemental Experimental Procedures and Supplemental Results.) Ts phenotypes appear to be more stringent in D. radiodurans dnaEts mutants than in the matching E. coli mutants. In D. radiodurans, dnaEts mutant viability is reduced 105-fold at the restrictive temperature (37°C) relative to the permissive temperature (30°C; Figure 4A), whereas in the analogous E. coli mutant the viability is reduced only 1000-fold at 42°C (Vandewiele et al., 2002Vandewiele D. Fernandez de Henestrosa A.R. Timms A.R. Bridges B.A. Woodgate R. Sequence analysis and phenotypes of five temperature sensitive mutator alleles of dnaE, encoding modified alpha-catalytic subunits of Escherichia coli DNA polymerase III holoenzyme.Mutat. Res. 2002; 499: 85-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Growth of dnaE1035ts was arrested at 37°C after an initial lag period of 1.5 hr, and its viability decreased with prolonged incubation (Figure 4B). Even wild-type cells grew somewhat slower at 37°C than at 30°C but remained viable even after 24 hr. Restoration of growth in dnaE1035ts after shifting the cells from liquid medium at 37°C to agar plates at 30°C is evidence of the reversibility of the heat inactivation of Pol III replicative activity (Figure 4B). Microscopic examination of exponential-phase dnaE1035ts cells incubated at 37°C for various time periods revealed changes in the cell size, shape, and nucleoid compared with the cells incubated at 30°C (Figure 4C). Incubation at 37°C gave rise to inflated cocci (up to 2-fold larger than at 30°C) unable to divide. Cell expansion was in many cases asymmetric within diplococci. After a 3 hr incubation at 37°C, the enlarged cells contained a large nucleoid mass with multiple small nucleoids either localized or dispersed throughout the cell. In some cells, dispersed DNA was observed instead of well-defined condensed nucleoids—a prevalent feature after 9 hr incubation at 37°C (Figure 4C). A 24 hr exposure at 37°C produced one of the two distinct nucleoid phenotypes: nucleoid dispersion throughout the cell or nucleoid contraction removed from the cell center. DNA synthesis in exponential dnaE1035ts cells ceased immediately after the temperature upshift and remained at background level, whereas the thymidine incorporation rate in the wild-type was up to 4-fold higher at 37°C than at 30°C (Figure 4D, panel 1). Similar patterns of DNA synthesis appeared for polA single and polA dnaE1035ts double mutants at 30°C (Figure 4D, panel 3). The level of DNA synthesis in the absence of both Pol I and Pol III activity (polA dnaE1035ts at 37°C) reached the same background level as in the absence of Pol III alone (dnaE1035ts at 37°C). Furthermore, the rate of DNA synthesis in the polA mutant was very similar to the wild-type, showing that Pol III is the principal contributor to global DNA synthesis under normal growth conditions. Unlike dnaE1035ts cells, which exhibited a slow gradual loss in viability at 37°C, the viability of polA dnaE1035ts cells decreased sharply and steadily at 37°C (Figure S7, panels 1 and 3). Postirradiation DNA synthesis in 7 kGy-irradiated wild-type cells comprised two periods: a DNA degradation period for 1.5 hr and a burst of DNA synthesis in the subsequent 1.5 hr coinciding with the genome reconstitution (Zahradka et al., 2006Zahradka K. Slade D. Bailone A. Sommer S. Averbeck D. Petranovic M. Lindner A.B. Radman M. Reassembly of shattered chromosomes in Deinococcus radiodurans.Nature. 2006; 443: 569-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar and Figure 4D, panel 2). Under Pol III-deficient conditions, DNA synthesis was abolished throughout the postirradiation period, showing that Pol III activity is indispensible for the bulk of DNA repair synthesis (Figure 4D, panel 2). PolA and polA dnaE1035ts mutants were irradiated at 2.45 kGy, a dose effecting 80% survival similar to 7 kGy irradiation of the wild-type (Figure S7). During the postirradiation incubation of the D. radiodurans polA mutant, the rate of DNA synthesis increased (Figure 4D, panel 4) while the viable cell count decreased (Figure S7, panel 4). Whereas the rate of DNA synthesis in irradiated wild-type cells was 5-fold higher than in unirradiated cells (Figure 4D, panels 1 and 2), the 2.45 kGy-irradiated polA cells exhibited an increase in the rate of DNA synthesis similar to the unirradiated polA cells, although the level of DNA synthesis was 5-fold lower (Figure 4D, panels 3 and 4). Deficiency in both DNA polymerases abolished DNA repair synthesis, just as in the absence of Pol III alone (Figure 4D, panel 4). Whereas the 2.45 kGy-irradiated polA cells died slowly during the first 6 hr of incubation and resumed division thereafter, polA dnaE1035ts cells at 37°C died rapidly (Figure S7, panel 4). The important contribution of Pol I to the survival potential, even in the absence of significant DNA synthesis, is consistent with its involvement in base excision repair (BER) of oxidatively damaged DNA fragments. No apparent DNA repair was detected in the PFGE experiments in the absence of Pol III activity (Figure 5A). Whereas after 7 kGy γ-irradiation, wild-type cells were equally efficient in restoring their genome within 3 hr at 30°C and 37°C (Figure S8), the dnaE1035ts mutant at 37°C showed no genome repair, even after 24 hr (Figure 5A). At lower doses of ionizing radiation, limited fragment reassembly occurred (<10%), pointing to the inefficiency of Pol III-independent repair (Figure S9). The additional absence of Pol I did not significantly change the repair pattern (Figure 5A). By comparison, DNA fragment reassembly in the 2.45 kGy-irradiated single polA mutant was completed within 4 hr at both 30°C and 37°C (Figures 5A and S10). Fast heat inactivation and rapid reversibility of the activity of the dnaE1035ts gene product at the permissive temperature (Figure 4B) were employed to investigate the Pol III requirement, and the dependence of Pol III activity on cooperation with Pol I, at different stages of DNA repair. We incubated 7 kGy-irradiated dnaE1035ts and 2.45 kGy-irradiated polA dnaE1035ts cells at 30°C and 37°C and then shifted at different times, and for different time intervals, to 37°C (upshift) and 30°C (downshift) respectively. Thus, Pol III activity was turned on and off during different postirradiation periods, and DNA repair was monitored by PFGE gels (Figures 5A, S11, and S12). Temperature upshifts demonstrated that the initial 0.5 hr incubation with functional Pol III was critical to DNA repair, permitting full restoration of all NotI fragments (Figure 5A). The lower band intensity of the restored fragments suggests that the recovery of the DNA amount equivalent to that observed prior to irradiation requires continuous Pol III activity. Pol III appears to be instrumental for the initiation of DNA repair synthesis and for the completion of extensive resynthesis of DNA. However, in the absence of Pol I, Pol III activity during the initial 0.5 hr after irradiation was not sufficient to allow for the restitution of all genomic NotI fragments even after 30 hr (Figure 5A), and the minimum duration of Pol III activity required for fragment reassembly was 3 hr (Figures S12A–S12C). The effectiveness of Pol III in DNA repair synthesis appears limited by the Pol I activity, possibly by Pol I preserving the integrity of DNA fragments via gap-filling during BER, or by enabling the elongation of DNA synthesis initiated by Pol III (Figure 7). Temperature downshifts further substantiated the requirement for Pol III in the initiation and elongation phases of DNA repair synthesis and its dependence on Pol I. The absence of Pol III activity only during the initial 0.5 or 1 hr period caused a slight delay in fragment reassembly, which was considerably more pronounced for longer periods of inactivation of Pol III (Figures S11D–S11F). Although Pol III-deficient cells failed to restore any NotI fragments within 3 hr after irradiation, when shifted to permissive temperature, they rapidly (within 1.5 hr) restored all fragments and ceased to die (Figures 5A and S11F). Even after 24 hr incubation at 37°C, the cells managed to resuscitate when shifted to 30°C (data not shown). Conversely, the inactivation of both Pol III and Pol I for more than 1 hr delayed fragment reassembly beyond 8 hr (Figures 5A and S12D–S12F). At more than 3 hr of inactivity of both Pol III and Pol I, fragment reassembly (at 30°C) was irrecoverable even 30 hr after irradiation. The complete absence of DNA repair synthesis caused an unabated DNA degradation, which irreversibly abrogated DNA repair and led to cell death. The effect of Pol I, Pol III, and RecA on DNA degradation was quantified by measuring the amount of radioactively prelabeled DNA during postirradiation recovery (Figures 2C and 5B). In 7 kGy-irradiated wild-type cells and 2.45 kGy-irradiated polA cells, 10%–15% of DNA was degraded during irradiation, reaching a maximum of 40% degradation after 1–1.5 hr of incubation at 30°C (Figure 5B). The radioactive thymidine released by DNA degradation was recycled (reincorporated) during the subsequent DNA synthesis. In dnaEts cells at 37°C, DNA degradation was 20% higher than in wild-type cells throughout the 1.5 hr period. DNA degradation was even more dramatic in the absence of both Pol I and Pol III: continuous degradation reached 70% after 6 hr (Figure 5B), an indication of the likely involvement of Pol I in BER. The effect of RecA on DNA degradation was the opposite: even in the 7 kGy-irradiated recA mutant, DNA was not degraded during irradiation, whereas postirradiation processing resulted in a maximum 20% degradation (Figure 2C), suggesting that RecA promotes DNA degradation. To monitor the single-strand annealing of newly synthesized strands, the final step in the process of the reassembly of DNA fragments, we used a previously developed fluoresence microscopy method based on the detection of ssDNA substituted with BrdU (a thymidine analog) by a fluorescent anti-BrdU antibody (Zahradka et al., 2006Zahradka K. Slade D. Bailone A. Sommer S."
https://openalex.org/W2089001645,"Meiotic sex chromosome inactivation (MSCI) during spermatogenesis is characterized by transcriptional silencing of genes on both the X and Y chromosomes in mid-to-late pachytene spermatocytes. MSCI is believed to result from meiotic silencing of unpaired DNA because the X and Y chromosomes remain largely unpaired throughout first meiotic prophase. However, unlike X-chromosome inactivation in female embryonic cells, where 25-30% of X-linked structural genes have been reported to escape inactivation, previous microarray- and RT-PCR-based studies of expression of >364 X-linked mRNA-encoding genes during spermatogenesis have failed to reveal any X-linked gene that escapes the silencing effects of MSCI in primary spermatocytes. Here we show that many X-linked miRNAs are transcribed and processed in pachytene spermatocytes. This unprecedented escape from MSCI by these X-linked miRNAs suggests that they may participate in a critical function at this stage of spermatogenesis, including the possibility that they contribute to the process of MSCI itself, or that they may be essential for post-transcriptional regulation of autosomal mRNAs during the late meiotic and early postmeiotic stages of spermatogenesis."

Living cells receive vast amounts of environmental information, and a central question is how the cell's system of signal transduction proteins is able to specifically process this information. This problem is particularly acute given that many closely related molecules (e.g., kinases, phosphatases, etc.) are involved in diverse, functionally distinct signaling pathways. An emerging paradigm is that, in many cases, signaling pathways are organized by scaffold proteins. Scaffolds are proteins that interact with multiple members of a pathway and are thought to function as “wiring” elements that by tethering pathway components into complexes and localizing them to specific sites in the cell, direct the flow of signaling information. Scaffolds are proposed to both enhance interactions between the correct signaling proteins and to insulate them from interactions with competing proteins (Bhattacharyya et al., 2006aBhattacharyya R.P.

Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 211-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). One of the first identified examples of a signaling scaffold is the Ste5 protein from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which plays an essential role in signal transmission through the yeast mating pathway. When yeast are stimulated by mating pheromone from the opposite mating type, signal is transmitted from the mating receptor (Ste2) via a heterotrimeric G protein (Gpa1, Ste4 and Ste18) to a mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase cascade. MAP kinase cascades are composed of three kinases that successively phosphorylate and activate one another: signal passes from a MAP kinase kinase kinase (MAPKKK) to a MAP kinase kinase (MAPKK) and finally to a MAP kinase (MAPK). In the mating pathway, signal is transmitted from the MAPKKK Ste11 to the MAPKK Ste7 to the MAPK Fus3. The Ste5 scaffold, although it has no catalytic domains (e.g., kinase domains), is required for the mating response. Ste5 was initially identified as a scaffold protein because, by yeast two-hybrid assays, it was shown to have binding sites for all three MAPK cascade members (Ste11, Ste7, and Fus3) (Choi et al., 1994Choi K.Y. Satterberg B. Lyons D.M. Elion E.A. Ste5 tethers multiple protein kinases in the MAP kinase cascade required for mating in S. cerevisiae.Cell. 1994; 78: 499-512Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) and the Gβ protein, Ste4 (Whiteway et al., 1995Whiteway M.S. Wu C. Leeuw T. Clark K. Fourest-Lieuvin A. Thomas D.Y. Leberer E. Association of the yeast pheromone response G protein beta gamma subunits with the MAP kinase scaffold Ste5p.Science. 1995; 269: 1572-1575Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Interaction with Ste4 localizes the Ste5 complex to the membrane upon stimulation, allowing Ste11 to be activated by a membrane-localized (PAK) kinase, Ste20. Additionally, interaction of Ste5 with the kinases in the cascade is thought to promote their successive phosphorylation. The need for robust mechanisms for controlling signaling specificity is particularly important for the mating pathway because of the potential for cross-signaling with other related MAPK pathways that use overlapping signaling components. For example, the filamentous growth pathway, which is activated by nitrogen starvation, requires kinases shared with the mating pathway: the MAPKKK Ste11 and the MAPKK Ste7 (although it does not require the scaffold Ste5). During the mating response, signaling to Ste7 is primarily transmitted to the MAPK Fus3, while in the filamentation pathway signaling is transmitted to the MAPK Kss1. Here we focus on the critical question of how activated Ste7 chooses between the two MAP kinases, Fus3 and Kss1, which are 55% identical (Figure 1A). Why does Ste7 that is activated by pheromone stimulation phosphorylate Fus3, whereas Ste7 that is activated by nitrogen starvation phosphorylate only Kss1? What is the role of the Ste5 scaffold in this specificity choice? Despite the importance of Ste5 as a canonical example of a scaffold protein, little is understood about the biochemical mechanisms that scaffolds use to regulate MAPK signaling specificity. The simplest model for how a scaffold might promote phosphorylation of one substrate versus another is through tethering – by increasing the proximity and effective concentration of components in the scaffold complex. Tethering, appears to be important for certain key aspects of Ste5 function: mutation of the binding sites for the Ste11 and Ste7 kinases disrupts signal transmission, while re-recruitment of these proteins to the Ste5 complex via heterologous engineered protein-protein interactions or covalent fusion can partially rescue signaling (Harris et al., 2001Harris K. Lamson R.E. Nelson B. Hughes T.R. Marton M.J. Roberts C.J. Boone C. Pryciak P.M.

Rewiring MAP kinase pathways using alternative scaffold assembly mechanisms.Science. 2003; 299: 1061-1064Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which Ste5 directs signaling from the MAPKK Ste7 to the MAPK Fus3, however, is far less clear. Is the scaffold needed to colocalize these kinases or does it play some other role? Previous work identified and characterized a binding site for Fus3 within Ste5. This ∼30 amino acid peptide (288–316) binds Fus3 with an affinity of 1 μM, and it stimulates partial Fus3 autophosphorylation (it promotes one of two phosphorylation events required for Fus3 activation) (Bhattacharyya et al., 2006aBhattacharyya R.P. Remenyi A. Good M.C. Bashor C.J. Falick A.M. Lim W.A. The Ste5 scaffold allosterically modulates signaling output of the yeast mating pathway.Science. 2006; 311: 822-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, however, mutation of this Fus3 binding site does not block mating but actually increases mating output (as measured by transcription), suggesting that this site plays more of a tuning role, modulating signaling dynamics (Bhattacharyya et al., 2006aBhattacharyya R.P. Remenyi A. Good M.C. Bashor C.J. Falick A.M. Lim W.A. The Ste5 scaffold allosterically modulates signaling output of the yeast mating pathway.Science. 2006; 311: 822-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, the scaffold as a whole is still absolutely required for signaling to Fus3. Thus, it appears that there may be another site in Ste5 that controls Fus3 activation and that the scaffold may be playing a more active or catalytic role in controlling signal transmission to this MAP kinase. Here we have purified components of the mating and filamentous growth MAP kinase pathways (Ste7, Fus3, Kss1, and Ste5) in order to understand the role of scaffolds in specifying in MAPKK→MAPK signal transmission. We find that Fus3 is intrinsically a poor substrate for activated Ste7, while Kss1 is intrinsically a very good substrate. A ∼200 residue segment of Ste5, however, is sufficient to permit Ste7 phosphorylation of Fus3 but has no effect on Kss1 phosphorylation. This Ste5 fragment is distinct from the previously identified Fus3 binding site, and crystallographic studies show that it is an independently folding domain which we refer to as Ste5-ms (minimal scaffold). The Ste5-ms domain binds tightly to Ste7, but only very weakly to Fus3. However, mutational and kinetic studies show that the Ste5-ms fragment can catalytically unlock the Fus3 MAPK so that it is now a good substrate for Ste7. This domain specifically increases the kcat for the Ste7→ Fus3 reaction by ∼5000-fold, while it has no effect on the kcat or KM of the Ste7→ Kss1 reaction. Fus3 appears to have evolved a structure that is “locked” to prevent stray activation by isolated forms of Ste7 (generated by non-mating inputs). Phosphorylation of Fus3 occurs only in the combined presence of Ste7 and Ste5, and this mechanism explains why Fus3 is only activated by mating input. The MAPKK, Ste7, is used in two distinct yeast MAPK pathways, the mating and filamentous growth pathways. When stimulated by α-factor (pheromone input for the mating pathway), Ste7 primarily activates the mating-specific MAPK Fus3. However, when stimulated by starvation (input for the filamentation or haploid invasive growth pathway), Ste7 activates Kss1. How Ste7 makes the appropriate input-dependent substrate choice between Fus3 and Kss1 (Figure 1A) is a challenging question, as the two alternative MAP kinases are very closely related (55% identity; > 70% similarity; Figure S8A available online). Previous genetic work indicates that the Ste5 scaffold is required to direct signal from a constitutively active MAPKKK Ste11 through Ste7 to the mating MAPK Fus3 (Figure 1C) (Flatauer et al., 2005Flatauer L.J. Zadeh S.F. Bardwell L. Mitogen-activated protein kinases with distinct requirements for Ste5 scaffolding influence signaling specificity in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 1793-1803Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Could Ste5 be playing a direct role in the selective activation of Fus3 by Ste7? To investigate the biochemical requirements for Ste7→MAPK specificity, we purified key components and reconstituted this pathway step in vitro. Previous studies have shown that in addition to any scaffold (Ste5) contributions, Ste7→Fus3 phosphorylation requires direct docking interactions between the two proteins (Figure 2A). Ste7 has two MAPK docking motifs on its N-terminus. These are ∼10 residue peptide motifs (consensus motif: [RK][RK]X(4-6)LxL) that are found to mediate functional interactions between MAPKs and a variety of their regulators and substrates (Remenyi et al., 2006Remenyi A. Good M.C. Lim W.A. Docking interactions in protein kinase and phosphatase networks.Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2006; 16: 676-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). At least one of these docking motifs is required for phosphorylation of either Fus3 or Kss1 by Ste7 (Bhattacharyya et al., 2006aBhattacharyya R.P. Remenyi A. Good M.C. Bashor C.J. Falick A.M. Lim W.A. The Ste5 scaffold allosterically modulates signaling output of the yeast mating pathway.Science. 2006; 311: 822-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, Remenyi et al., 2005Remenyi A.

Cell. 2005; 20: 951-962Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). However, the docking sites in Ste7 cannot be sufficient to distinguish between Fus3 and Kss1, since they bind to both Fus3 and Kss1 with roughly equal affinity (stronger site KD ∼100nM) (Remenyi et al., 2005Remenyi A. Good M.C. Bhattacharyya R.P. Lim W.A. The role of docking interactions in mediating signaling input, output, and discrimination in the yeast MAPK network.Mol. Cell. 2005; 20: 951-962Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). We first investigated whether Ste7 could activate the MAPKs Fus3 and Kss1 in vitro. We expressed and purified the following recombinant proteins: Fus3, Kss1, a constitutively active form of Ste7 (Ste7EE, bearing S359E and T363E phosphomimic mutations in the Ste7 activation loop) (Maleri et al., 2004Maleri S. Ge Q. Hackett E.A. Wang Y. Dohlman H.G. Errede B. Persistent activation by constitutive Ste7 promotes Kss1-mediated invasive growth but fails to support Fus3-dependent mating in yeast.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 9221-9238Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), and ΔN-Ste5 (Ste5, with a 279 residue N-terminal deletion, which makes the protein soluble and biochemically tractable) (Figure 2B). The ability of Ste7EE to activate Fus3 or Kss1 was measured using a fluorescence-based MAPK assay (Trulight kinase assay, Calbiochem–see Figure S2). We found that Ste7EE rapidly activated Kss1, either in the presence or absence of purified Ste5 (all components at 50 nM) (Figure 2C). In contrast, Ste7EE cannot activate Fus3, demonstrating that Fus3 is an intrinsically weak substrate for Ste7 (Figure 2D). If, however, the Ste5 scaffold is added, Ste7 rapidly phosphorylates Fus3 at a rate comparable to Kss1 (Figure 2D). These results indicate that Fus3 is inherently a poor substrate for Ste7, but that Ste5 can serve as a coactivator to permit efficient Ste7→Fus3 phosphorylation. How does the Ste5 scaffold permit Ste7→Fus3 phosphorylation? The simplest model is that a protein scaffold like Ste5 acts as a tethering or colocalization device that enhances the interaction of proteins that interact poorly on their own (Figure 3A). Consistent with a tethering model, mutagenesis of Ste5 and a prior yeast-two hybrid study have identified binding sites for both Ste7 and Fus3 within the Ste5 scaffold (Choi et al., 1994Choi K.Y. Satterberg B. Lyons D.M. Elion E.A. Ste5 tethers multiple protein kinases in the MAP kinase cascade required for mating in S. cerevisiae.Cell. 1994; 78: 499-512Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, Inouye et al., 1997aInouye C.

Mutational analysis of STE5 in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae: application of a differential interaction trap assay for examining protein-protein interactions.Genetics. 1997; 147: 479-492Crossref PubMed Google Scholar; Figure 3B). Conversely, two other results argue strongly that Ste5 is not acting as a simple tether to promote Ste7→Fus3 phosphorylation. First, as described above, Fus3 can already bind tightly to Ste7 without the scaffold due to the MAPK docking motifs found at the N-terminus of Ste7 (Bardwell et al., 1996Bardwell L. Cook J.G. Chang E.C. Cairns B.R. Thorner J.

The role of docking interactions in mediating signaling input, output, and discrimination in the yeast MAPK network.Mol. Cell. 2005; 20: 951-962Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Second, we show here that the previously identified Fus3 binding site in Ste5 (residues 288–316 in Ste5) is not required to promote the Ste7→Fus3 reaction. A variant of Ste5, in which this site is mutated so that it no longer binds Fus3 (Ste5-ND) (Bhattacharyya et al., 2006aBhattacharyya R.P. Remenyi A. Good M.C. Bashor C.J. Falick A.M. Lim W.A. The Ste5 scaffold allosterically modulates signaling output of the yeast mating pathway.Science. 2006; 311: 822-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar), is indistinguishable from the wild-type protein in its ability to promote the Ste7→Fus3 reaction in vitro (Figures 3B and 3C). In contrast when the MAPK docking sites in Ste7 are mutated, Ste7 cannot phosphorylate either Fus3 or Kss1, both in the presence or absence of Ste5 (Figure 3E). Furthermore, when the previously identified Fus3 binding domain in Ste5 is mutated in vivo, mating output upon alpha-factor stimulation actually increases (Bhattacharyya et al., 2006aBhattacharyya R.P. Remenyi A. Good M.C. Bashor C.J. Falick A.M. Lim W.A. The Ste5 scaffold allosterically modulates signaling output of the yeast mating pathway.Science. 2006; 311: 822-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Together, these results are consistent with a model in which this previously characterized Fus3 binding motif does not play a role in promoting the main flow of signaling information from the MAPKK Ste7 to the MAPK Fus3, but rather plays a modulatory role in tuning the quantitative and dynamic output of the pathway. The finding that the Fus3 binding domain in Ste5 is not required for mating signaling in vitro led us to postulate that there might be a different region of Ste5 that promotes Ste7→Fus3 phosphorylation. Therefore, we performed deletion analysis to search for the minimal region of Ste5 that was capable of permitting Ste7→Fus3 phosphorylation (Figure 3B). We identified a ∼200 residue fragment of Ste5 (593-786) that was sufficient for promoting Fus3 phosphorylation. As will be discussed later, structural analysis revealed that this fragment forms a unique, independently folded domain. This domain was at least as active as a larger fragment of Ste5 (ΔN-Ste5) in promoting Ste7→Fus3 phosphorylation (Figure 3D) and we refer to the domain as the Ste5 minimal scaffold (Ste5-ms). The Ste5-ms domain lacks the previously identified Fus3 and Ste11-binding regions but contains part of the previously mapped Ste7-binding region (Inouye et al., 1997aInouye C. Dhillon N. Durfee T. Zambryski P.C. Thorner J. Mutational analysis of STE5 in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae: application of a differential interaction trap assay for examining protein-protein interactions.Genetics. 1997; 147: 479-492Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In fluorescence polarization binding studies, we found that the Ste5-ms domain binds tightly to Ste7 (KD = 75nM) (Figure 3F) but does not detectably bind to Fus3 (Figure 3F). The lack of a strong Fus3 binding site in the Ste5-ms fragment argues against a mechanism in which this fragment is acting as a passive tether, simply increasing the effective concentration of Ste7 and Fus3. Although colocalization of the two proteins does appear to be necessary, it is the direct docking interaction between the MAPKK Ste7 and MAPK Fus3 that plays this role (Figure 3G). Tethering of the two proteins (Ste7 and Fus3) together, however, does not seem to be sufficient for Fus3 activation. Thus the Ste5-ms domain must play a distinct functional role in promoting phosphorylation. To understand precisely how the Ste5-ms domain contributes to Fus3 phosphorylation we performed quantitative kinetic analyses (Figure 4). We measured the kcat and KM of Fus3 and Kss1 phosphorylation by Ste7EE both in the presence and absence of the Ste5-ms fragment (scaffold concentration 1 μM). To simplify the kinetic analysis, we used a variant of Ste7 with a single docking site (mutant Ste7EE-ND2 has the second, weaker docking motif removed). This Ste7EE variant has the same kcat as Ste7EE with both docking motifs, and behaves similarly in other assays both in vivo (Bhattacharyya et al., 2006aBhattacharyya R.P. Remenyi A. Good M.C. Bashor C.J. Falick A.M. Lim W.A. The Ste5 scaffold allosterically modulates signaling output of the yeast mating pathway.Science. 2006; 311: 822-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar) and in vitro (data not shown) (Remenyi et al., 2005Remenyi A. Good M.C. Bhattacharyya R.P. Lim W.A. The role of docking interactions in mediating signaling input, output, and discrimination in the yeast MAPK network.Mol. Cell. 2005; 20: 951-962Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). As a substrate, we used a catalytically-dead allele of the MAPK Fus3 (K42R) in order to eliminate background autophosphorylation that is observed for the wild-type protein. These experiments show that the Ste5-ms domain enhances the kcat of Fus3 phosphorylation by Ste7EE by ∼5000-fold, with little effect on the KM (Figure 4C), further contradicting a potential tethering role for the Ste5-ms domain (which would be expected to lower the KM). This effect on kcat is highly substrate specific - the Ste5-ms domain has essentially no impact, positive or negative, on the kcat or KM of Kss1 phosphorylation by Ste7 (Figures 4C and 4D). By varying the concentration of Ste5-ms in a reaction containing 50 nM Ste7EE-ND2 and saturating (750 nM) Fus3 we determined that the concentration of Ste5-ms required to maximally exert its effects is less than 1 μM. This titration experiment gives a midpoint of activation (Kactivation, an estimation of Ste7/Ste5-ms dissociation) of 161 nM. This number is roughly the same as the KD for the Ste7-Ste5-ms interaction measured by anisotropy (75 nM), consistent with a model in which the Ste7/Ste5-ms complex is the catalytically competent complex. A simple model for how the Ste5-ms domain kinetically modulates the Fus3 phosphorylation reaction is shown in the reaction coordinate free energy diagrams (Figure 4F). Ste7EE is able to phosphorylate Kss1 efficiently in the presence or absence of Ste5 because it has a low transition state energy (E•S ‡). In contrast, Ste7EE is unable to phosphorylate Fus3, because it has a much higher transition state energy—Fus3 is an intrinsically poor substrate. The Ste5-ms scaffold domain is able to lower the energy of Fus3's transition state, resulting in a higher kcat, thereby converting a very poor substrate into a good substrate, comparable to Kss1. Thus, the Ste5-ms domain is essentially serving as a substrate specific cocatalyst for Ste7→Fus3 phosphorylation – a role that is conceptually similar to that of a cyclin which acts as a cocatalyst for the cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk). To understand how the Ste5-ms domain might act as a substrate-specific cocatalyst, we determined the structure of the domain. We obtained crystals of the Ste5-ms fragment and solved the structure to 1.6 Å resolution (Figures 5A and S5A and Table S2; PDB ID = 3FZE). This fragment adopts a well-ordered, independently folded structural domain. While primary sequence analysis (BLAST) failed to identify proteins clearly related to the Ste5-ms domain (outside of yeasts closely related to S. cerevisiae), the structural homology program DALI (Holm and Sander, 1996Holm L. Sander C. Mapping the protein universe.Science. 1996; 273: 595-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (1268) Google Scholar) showed that this domain shares the same fold as the von-Willebrand Type-A (VWA) domain found in extracellular matrix proteins and integrin receptors (Figures 5B and S5B). Although many of known VWA domain proteins are extracellular, the most ancient VWA domains conserved across all eukaryotes appear to be intracellular proteins involved in diverse multiprotein assemblies (Whittaker and Hynes, 2002Whittaker C.A. Hynes R.O. Distribution and evolution of von Willebrand/integrin A domains: widely dispersed domains with roles in cell adhesion and elsewhere.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 3369-3387Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). Using the Ste5-ms structure as a guide, we performed extensive mutagenesis of the ms domain surface to try to identify regions of the protein that are critical for catalysis (Figure S6). Twenty one mutant proteins were generated, each containing a block of 2–3 mutant residues clustered together on the protein surface. Of these mutant proteins, six out of 21 showed greatly diminished (>100-fold decrease) ability to promote Ste7-to-Fus3 phosphorylation (Figure S6B). We then screened these mutants for their effect on both binding to Ste7 and on the kcat of Fus3 phosphorylation (Figures S6B and S7A). Five of the six mutations to the Ste5-ms domain that significantly disrupt activity cluster on two structurally and functionally distinct interfaces (Figure 5C). The first interface contains four sets of mutations that selectively block catalysis without disrupting binding to Ste7; these mutations significantly reduce the kcat for Ste7EE-ND2→Fus3 phosphorylation, but do not alter Ste7/Ste5-ms interaction (representative mutant “C” is shown in Figures 5D and 5E). This region is composed of a semi-disordered loop (residues 745–756) which we have named the “coactivator loop.” We postulate that this loop plays a role in lowering the barrier of the Ste7→Fus3 phosphorylation reaction, perhaps through transient interactions with Fus3. A second interface, near the C terminus of the Ste5-ms domain, appears to be involved in direct binding to Ste7. This interface consists of a negatively charged segment (DEHDDDDEEDN, residues 776–786). Mutant “B” is a variant of the Ste5-ms domain in which the nine most C-terminal residues (778–786) have been deleted. This mutant is catalytically impaired, most likely because, as shown in pull-down assays, it has greatly reduced binding to Ste7 (Figures 5D and 5E). In summary, there appear to be two functionally distinct surfaces on the Ste5-ms domain that are critical for its function in promoting Ste7→Fus3 phosphorylation: one that is responsible for association with Ste7, and a distinct surface that is responsible for Fus3-specific catalysis. A prediction of this model is that the mutations that selectively reduce the affinity of the Ste5-Ste7 interaction should be able to rescue the Ste7→Fus3 reaction if added at much higher concentrations (kcat values shown in Figure 4D were only measured at a concentration of 1 μM Ste5-ms). As predicted, a Ste5-ms protein bearing mutation B, which selectively disrupts Ste7 binding, has a kcat for the Ste7→Fus3 reaction that is comparable to that of the wild-type protein, but only when added at ∼100-fold higher concentrations (Figure 5F). In contrast, addition of increasing amounts of a Ste5-ms protein bearing mutation C (a “coactivator” mutation) plateaus at a kcat that is 1000-fold lower than observed with wild-type Ste5-ms (does not result in increased kcat) (Figure S7B). The importance of these two regions within the Ste5-ms domain is also highlighted by alignment of homologs of Ste5 from other fungal species. The most conserved region of these Ste5 scaffold homologs corresponds to the Ste5-ms domains (Figure S3B), and especially both within the coactivator loop (745–756) and across the previously defined Ste7 binding region (Figure S3C). There are two distinct models for how the Ste5-ms domain promotes Ste7→ Fus3 phosphorylation. One model is that the Ste5-ms primarily acts as an activator of Ste7 to enhance its overall catalytic activity (Figure 6A, top), much as a cyclin activates a CDK. A second competing model is that Ste5-ms primarily acts to convert Fus3 from a poor Ste7 substrate to a good Ste7 substrate (Figure 6A, bottom). A prediction of the first model is that addition of Ste5 to Ste7 will enhance its overall kinase activity toward any substrate. To test this model, we compared rates of phosphorylation of a general substrate, myelin basic protein, by Ste7EE, in the presence and absence of the Ste5-ms domain (Figure 6B). The rates are indistinguishable, indicating that the Ste5-ms domain is not a general activator of Ste7. In addition, as described above, the addition of Ste5-ms has no effect on the Ste7→Kss1 reaction (Figures 4B and 4C). These two findings strongly disfavor a model where the Ste5-ms upregulates the general kinase activity of Ste7 to enhance Fus3 phosphorylation. These results point toward the alternative model in which the Ste5-ms exerts its effect on the substrate – it selectively improves Fus3 as a substrate for Ste7. This model suggests that a key difference between the closely related, competing MAPK's Kss1 and Fus3, is that Kss1 is already primed to be a good subst"

The objective of this study was to assess serum biomarkers that differentiate between CM and non-CM, with the long-term goal of developing a clinically informative prognostic test for severe malaria.Based on the hypothesis that endothelial activation and blood-brain-barrier dysfunction contribute to CM pathogenesis, we examined the endothelial regulators, angiopoietin-1 (ANG-1) and angiopoietin-2 (ANG-2), in serum samples from P. falciparum-infected patients with uncomplicated malaria (UM) or CM, from two diverse populations--Thai adults and Ugandan children. Angiopoietin levels were compared to tumour necrosis factor (TNF). In both populations, ANG-1 levels were significantly decreased and ANG-2 levels were significantly increased in CM versus UM and healthy controls (p<0.001). TNF was significantly elevated in CM in the Thai adult population (p<0.001), but did not discriminate well between CM and UM in African children. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis showed that ANG-1 and the ratio of ANG-2:ANG-1 accurately discriminated CM patients from UM in both populations. Applied as a diagnostic test, ANG-1 had a sensitivity and specificity of 100% for distinguishing CM from UM in Thai adults and 70% and 75%, respectively, for Ugandan children. Across both populations the likelihood ratio of CM given a positive test (ANG-1<15 ng/mL) was 4.1 (2.7-6.5) and the likelihood ratio of CM given a negative test was 0.29 (0.20-0.42). Moreover, low ANG-1 levels at presentation predicted subsequent mortality in children with CM (p = 0.027).ANG-1 and the ANG-2/1 ratio are promising clinically informative biomarkers for CM. Additional studies should address their utility as prognostic biomarkers and potential therapeutic targets in severe malaria."
https://openalex.org/W2024818056,"The transcriptional status of a gene can be maintained through multiple rounds of cell division during development. This epigenetic effect is believed to reflect heritable changes in chromatin folding and histone modifications or variants at target genes, but little is known about how these chromatin features are inherited through cell division. A particular challenge for maintaining transcription states is DNA replication, which disrupts or dilutes chromatin-associated proteins and histone modifications. PRC1-class Polycomb group protein complexes are essential for development and are thought to heritably silence transcription by altering chromatin folding and histone modifications. It is not known whether these complexes and their effects are maintained during DNA replication or subsequently re-established. We find that when PRC1-class Polycomb complex-bound chromatin or DNA is replicated in vitro, Polycomb complexes remain bound to replicated templates. Retention of Polycomb proteins through DNA replication may contribute to maintenance of transcriptional silencing through cell division."

This study reveals a novel pathway for cilia assembly and provides insight into the evolution of the Hh signalling cascade. Hedgehog signalling is important in development and disease; Fused is required for Hedgehog signalling in Drosophila but not in mice. Here it is shown how the function of Fused has evolved by studying its role in zebrafish relative to mice, providing insight into the evolution of the Hedgehog signalling cascade. Hedgehog (Hh) signalling is essential for several aspects of embryogenesis1,2. In Drosophila, Hh transduction is mediated by a cytoplasmic signalling complex3,4,5 that includes the putative serine-threonine kinase Fused (Fu) and the kinesin Costal 2 (Cos2, also known as Cos), yet Fu does not have a conserved role in Hh signalling in mammals6,7. Mouse Fu (also known as Stk36) mutants are viable and seem to respond normally to Hh signalling. Here we show that mouse Fu is essential for construction of the central pair apparatus of motile, 9+2 cilia and offers a new model of human primary ciliary dyskinesia. We found that mouse Fu physically interacts with Kif27, a mammalian Cos2 orthologue8, and linked Fu to known structural components of the central pair apparatus, providing evidence for the first regulatory component involved in central pair construction. We also demonstrated that zebrafish Fu is required both for Hh signalling and cilia biogenesis in Kupffer’s vesicle. Mouse Fu rescued both Hh-dependent and -independent defects in zebrafish. Our results delineate a new pathway for central pair apparatus assembly, identify common regulators of Hh signalling and motile ciliogenesis, and provide insights into the evolution of the Hh cascade."
https://openalex.org/W2020430187,"P2X4 and P2X7 are the predominant P2X receptor subtypes expressed in immune cells. Having previously shown a structural and functional interaction between the two recombinant receptors, our aims here were to identify the preferred assembly pathway of the endogenous receptors in macrophage-like cells and to investigate the trafficking of these receptors between the plasma membrane and intracellular sites. We exploited the difference in size between the two subunits, and we used a combination of cross-linkers and blue native-PAGE analysis to investigate the subunit composition of complexes present in primary cultures of rat microglia and macrophages from wild type and P2X7(-/-) mice. Our results indicate that the preferred assembly pathway for both receptors is the formation of homotrimers. Homotrimers of P2X7 were able to co-immunoprecipitate with P2X4, suggesting that an interaction occurs between rather than within receptor complexes. In both macrophages and microglia, P2X7 receptors were predominantly at the cell surface, whereas P2X4 receptors were predominantly intracellular. There were clear cell type-dependent differences in the extent to which P2X4 receptors trafficked to and from the surface; trafficking was much more dynamic in microglia than in the macrophages, and further activation of cultured microglia with relatively short (3-h) incubations with lipopolysaccharide caused an approximately 4-fold increase in the fraction of receptors at the surface with only a 1.2-fold increase in total expression. The redistribution of intracellular receptors is thus an efficient means of enhancing the functional expression of P2X4 at the plasma membrane of microglia."
https://openalex.org/W2153130957,"Trophic structure, or the distribution of biomass among producers and consumers, determines key ecosystem values, such as the abundance of infectious, harvestable or conservation target species, and the storage and cycling of carbon and nutrients. There has been much debate on what controls ecosystem trophic structure, yet the answer is still elusive. Here we show that the nutritional quality of primary producers controls the trophic structure of ecosystems. By increasing the efficiency of trophic transfer, higher producer nutritional quality results in steeper ecosystem trophic structure, and those changes are more pronounced in terrestrial than in aquatic ecosystems probably due to the more stringent nutritional limitation of terrestrial herbivores. These results explain why ecosystems composed of highly nutritional primary producers feature high consumer productivity, fast energy recycling, and reduced carbon accumulation. Anthropogenic changes in producer nutritional quality, via changes in trophic structure, may alter the values and functions of ecosystems, and those alterations may be more important in terrestrial ecosystems."
https://openalex.org/W2018393721,"Probiotics are believed to alleviate allergic and inflammatory skin disorders, but their impact on pathogenic effector T cells remains poorly documented. Here we show that oral treatment with the probiotic bacteria L. casei (DN-114 001) alone alleviates antigen-specific skin inflammation mediated by either protein-specific CD4(+) T cells or hapten-specific CD8(+) T cells. In the model of CD8(+) T cell-mediated skin inflammation, which reproduces allergic contact dermatitis in human, inhibition of skin inflammation by L. casei is not due to impaired priming of hapten-specific IFNgamma-producing cytolytic CD8(+) effector T cells. Alternatively, L. casei treatment reduces the recruitment of CD8(+) effector T cells into the skin during the elicitation (i.e. symptomatic) phase of CHS. Inhibition of skin inflammation by L. casei requires MHC class II-restricted CD4(+) T cells but not CD1d-restricted NK-T cells. L casei treatment enhanced the frequency of FoxP3(+) Treg in the skin and increased the production of IL-10 by CD4(+)CD25(+) regulatory T cells in skin draining lymph nodes of hapten-sensitized mice. These data demonstrate that orally administered L. casei (DN-114 001) efficiently alleviate T cell-mediated skin inflammation without causing immune suppression, via mechanisms that include control of CD8(+) effector T cells and involve regulatory CD4(+) T cells. L. casei (DN-114 001) may thus represent a probiotic of potential interest for immunomodulation of T cell-mediated allergic skin diseases in human."
https://openalex.org/W2056158185,"The pathophysiology of obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus is associated with abnormalities in endocrine signaling in adipose tissue and one of the key signaling affectors operative in these disorders is the nuclear hormone transcription factor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARgamma). PPARgamma has pleiotropic functions affecting a wide range of fundamental biological processes including the regulation of genes that modulate insulin sensitivity, adipocyte differentiation, inflammation and atherosclerosis. To date, only a limited number of direct targets for PPARgamma have been identified through research using the well established pre-adipogenic cell line, 3T3-L1. In order to obtain a genome-wide view of PPARgamma binding sites, we applied the pair end-tagging technology (ChIP-PET) to map PPARgamma binding sites in 3T3-L1 preadipocyte cells.Coupling gene expression profile analysis with ChIP-PET, we identified in a genome-wide manner over 7700 DNA binding sites of the transcription factor PPARgamma and its heterodimeric partner RXR during the course of adipocyte differentiation. Our validation studies prove that the identified sites are bona fide binding sites for both PPARgamma and RXR and that they are functionally capable of driving PPARgamma specific transcription. Our results strongly indicate that PPARgamma is the predominant heterodimerization partner for RXR during late stages of adipocyte differentiation. Additionally, we find that PPARgamma/RXR association is enriched within the proximity of the 5' region of the transcription start site and this association is significantly associated with transcriptional up-regulation of genes involved in fatty acid and lipid metabolism confirming the role of PPARgamma as the master transcriptional regulator of adipogenesis. Evolutionary conservation analysis of these binding sites is greater when adjacent to up-regulated genes than down-regulated genes, suggesting the primordial function of PPARgamma/RXR is in the induction of genes. Our functional validations resulted in identifying novel PPARgamma direct targets that have not been previously reported to promote adipogenic differentiation.We have identified in a genome-wide manner the binding sites of PPARgamma and RXR during the course of adipogenic differentiation in 3T3L1 cells, and provide an important resource for the study of PPARgamma function in the context of adipocyte differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W2029818029,"Food availability is a potent environmental cue that directs circadian locomotor activity in rodents. Even though nocturnal rodents prefer to forage at night, daytime food anticipatory activity (FAA) is observed prior to short meals presented at a scheduled time of day. Under this restricted feeding regimen, rodents exhibit two distinct bouts of activity, a nocturnal activity rhythm that is entrained to the light-dark cycle and controlled by the master clock in the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) and a daytime bout of activity that is phase-locked to mealtime. FAA also occurs during food deprivation, suggesting that a food-entrainable oscillator (FEO) keeps time in the absence of scheduled feeding. Previous studies have demonstrated that the FEO is anatomically distinct from the SCN and that FAA is observed in mice lacking some circadian genes essential for timekeeping in the SCN. In the current study, we optimized the conditions for examining FAA during restricted feeding and food deprivation in mice lacking functional BMAL1, which is critical for circadian rhythm generation in the SCN. We found that BMAL1-deficient mice displayed FAA during restricted feeding in 12hr light:12hr dark (12L:12D) and 18L:6D lighting cycles, but distinct activity during food deprivation was observed only in 18L:6D. While BMAL1-deficient mice also exhibited robust FAA during restricted feeding in constant darkness, mice were hyperactive during food deprivation so it was not clear that FAA consistently occurred at the time of previously scheduled food availability. Taken together, our findings suggest that optimization of experimental conditions such as photoperiod may be necessary to visualize FAA in genetically modified mice. Furthermore, the expression of FAA may be possible without a circadian oscillator that depends on BMAL1."

The basic module of [NiFe] hydrogenases consists of two subunits, a large subunit that contains the [NiFe] active site and a small subunit that accommodates one to three electron-transferring iron-sulfur clusters (2Volbeda A.

The active site nickel is coordinated to the protein via the thiol groups of four invariant cysteine residues, two of which serve as bridging ligands to the iron. The active site iron carries three additional diatomic ligands, two cyanides (CN−) and one carbon monoxide (CO) (9Volbeda A. Garcia E. Piras C. de Lacey A.L. Fernandez V.M. Hatchikian E.C. Frey M.

In addition to H2, the active sites of the vast majority of [FeFe] and [NiFe] hydrogenases react with dioxygen. In case of the [FeFe] hydrogenases, this usually leads to an irreversible destruction of the active site (11Vincent K.A. Parkin A. Lenz O. Albracht S.P. Fontecilla-Camps J.C. Cammack R. Friedrich B.

Under electron-rich conditions in the presence of O2 a mono-oxo species, most probably a hydroxide, is formed in the bridging position between nickel and iron (15Lamle S.E. Albracht S.P.

On the basis of EPR spectroscopy, this paramagnetic “ready inactive” state has been designated as Nir-B. Incubation of the enzyme with O2 under electron-poor conditions results in the so-called “unready inactive” Niu-A state. It is anticipated that a di-oxo species (e.g. hydroperoxide) binds in the bridging position (16Ogata H. Hirota S. Nakahara A. Komori H. Shibata N. Kato T. Kano K. Higuchi Y.

Reijerse E. van Gastel M. Chem. Rev. 2007; 107: 4331-4365Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). The Niu-A and Nir-B states differ significantly in their reactivation kinetics. H2-mediated reductive activation of the Niu-A state is a long term process and requires hours until the oxygen species is completely removed from the active site. In contrast, only seconds of incubation with H2 are required to convert the Nir-B state into the catalytically active, EPR-detectable Nia-C state in which a hydride occupies the bridging position between nickel and iron (19Fernandez V.M.

Formation of the Niu-A state prevents most of the [NiFe] hydrogenases, predominantly those from anaerobic microorganisms, from being catalytically active even in the presence of traces of O2. However, the so-called Knallgasbacteria contain [NiFe] hydrogenases that enable these microorganisms to gain energy from H2 oxidation even in the presence of atmospheric oxygen concentrations (22Aragno M.

This result impressively demonstrates that O2 reacts with the MBH active site in a way that still allows the catalytic conversion of H2. FTIR and EPR spectroscopy are valuable techniques to get insights into the composition and redox state of cofactors as well as on structure-function relationships even if a crystal structure of the enzyme is not yet available (for recent reviews see Refs. 18Lubitz W.

EPR allows the detection of redox-dependent changes of the electronic structure of both the [NiFe] active site in the large subunit and the Fe-S clusters in the small subunit. However, only paramagnetic metal species can be traced by EPR, whereas divalent nickel species that are constituents of the hydrogenase catalytic cycle are invisible by this technique. The dimeric form of the MBH has been used successfully as a constituent in enzymatic fuel cells and for light-driven H2 production (36Vincent K.A. Cracknell J.A. Clark J.R. Ludwig M. Lenz O.

A very recent biochemical and electrochemical study revealed that O2 tolerance of the R. eutropha MBH is ultimately linked to a high affinity for hydrogen with a concomitant extremely low affinity for oxygen (34Ludwig M.

To get insights into the electronic structure of the active site and the iron-sulfur clusters, which underlies the oxygen tolerance, we have re-investigated the spectroscopic properties of the MBH. In addition to earlier studies (38Schneider K. Patil D.S. Cammack R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 748: 353-361Crossref Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 39Knüttel K. Schneider K. Erkens A. Plass W.

The frequencies of these modes are known to be sensitive to the electron density distribution in the catalytic center and thus can be used to monitor redox transitions (35De Lacey A.L. Fernandez V.M.

Importantly, FTIR spectroscopy does not only rely on paramagnetic states of metal centers and, hence, is a useful tool to investigate all O2-mediated noncatalytic states as well as all redox states involved in H2 conversion. In this study we show that the MBH was never found in the oxygen-inactivated Ni-A state, which is in perfect agreement with recent electrochemical studies that revealed an extremely fast reactivation of the MBH dimer after treatment with dioxygen (34Ludwig M. Cracknell J.A. Vincent K.A. Armstrong F.A. Lenz O. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 465-477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). However, our studies also present evidence that a significant portion of the MBH dimer that has been removed from the cytoplasmic membrane resided in a catalytically inactive form. Therefore, we investigated for the first time the spectroscopic properties of the trimeric form of the MBH, including HoxZ, tightly bound to the cytoplasmic membrane (Fig. 1B). The trimeric MBH turned out to form only the Nir-B state and a small amount of ready or unready Ni-S states upon oxidation, which both reacted completely and reversibly with H2. The spectroscopic properties of the MBH are discussed with regard to the O2 tolerance of this unusual catalyst. The R. eutropha MBH was overexpressed in a nontagged version using plasmid pLO6, harboring the complete MBH operon, in R. eutropha strain HF631, a megaplasmid-free derivative of R. eutropha (43Lenz O. Gleiche A. Strack A. Friedrich B. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 6590-6595Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The cytoplasmic membrane was separated by osmotic shock to remove the outer membrane according to a modified protocol of Witholt et al. (44Witholt B. Boekhout M. Brock M. Kingma J. van Heerikhuizen H. Leij L.D. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 74: 160-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Cells were cultivated lithoautotrophically in mineral salts medium (45Schwartz E. Gerischer U. Friedrich B. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 3197-3204Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) under an atmosphere of 75% H2, 15% O2, and 10% CO2 at 30 °C and continuous shaking at 120 rpm. Cells from 0.5 liter of culture volume were harvested at an A436 of 18–20 (centrifugation at 5000 × g at 4 °C for 20 min) and resuspended in 1 liter of 50 mm Tris/HCl buffer at pH 7.8. The cells were collected by centrifugation (5000 × g, 20 min, 4 °C) and resuspended in 400 ml of sucrose buffer (192 g of sucrose, 50 mm Tris/HCl buffer at pH 7.8 in 500 ml, 1 mm EDTA) and incubated at room temperature for 5 min. Subsequently, the suspension was again centrifuged (32,000 × g, 20 min, 4 °C), and the cells were exposed to osmotic shock by resuspending the pellet in 200 ml of deionized H2O. The resulting spheroplasts were collected by centrifugation (4000 × g, 20 min, 4 °C), resuspended in 100 ml of 50 mm K-PO4 buffer (pH 7.0), and subsequently disrupted using a French pressure cell (Constant Cell Disruption Systems) and ultrasonication (2 min, level 2.5, 75%) (Branson Sonifier). The cell extract was subjected to ultracentrifugation (100,000 × g, 60 min 4 °C), and the membrane fraction was isolated by removing the upper brownish part of the pellet with a spatula. The cytoplasmic membrane was homogenized in an appropriate volume of 50 mm K-PO4 buffer (pH 7.0), ultracentrifuged (100,000 × g, 30 min, 4 °C), and finally homogenized in about 1 ml of 50 mm K-PO4 buffer (pH 7.0). For purification of the MBH, a derivative carrying a Strep Tag II at the C terminus of the small subunit (HoxK) encoded on plasmid pGE636 in R. eutropha strain HF631 was used (46Schubert T. Lenz O. Krause E. Volkmer R. Friedrich B. Mol. Microbiol. 2007; 66: 453-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The cells were grown lithoautotrophically in a fermentor (type NLF 22, Bioengineering, Wald, Switzerland) in mineral salts medium (45Schwartz E. Gerischer U. Friedrich B. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 3197-3204Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) under an atmosphere of 75% H2, 15% O2, and 10% CO2 at 30 °C. The cells were harvested by centrifugation (5000 × g, 20 min 4 °C) at an A436 of about 20. The cell pellet was washed with an appropriate amount of phosphate buffer (90 g liter−1 Na2HPO4 × 12 H2O, 15 g liter−1 KH2PO4), frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C. The MBH dimer was purified as described previously (34Ludwig M. Cracknell J.A. Vincent K.A. Armstrong F.A. Lenz O. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 465-477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The protein was concentrated using centrifugal filter devices (Amicon Ultra15 (PL-30), Amicon Microcon (YM-30), Millipore) to volumes with protein concentrations (200–500 μm) appropriate for IR and EPR spectroscopy. The protein concentration was determined by the Bradford method (47Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (214515) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as standard. The purity of the samples was examined by SDS-PAGE (48Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206658) Google Scholar). Hydrogenase assays were performed as described previously (32Schink B. Schlegel H.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1979; 567: 315-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) in 50 mm K-PO4 buffer at pH 7.0 for membrane-attached MBH and at pH 5.5 for solubilized MBH. Methylene blue was used as artificial electron acceptor, and its absorption was measured photometrically at 570 nm. 9.5 GHz X-band EPR spectroscopy has been carried out using a Bruker ESP300E spectrometer equipped with a rectangular microwave cavity in the TE102 mode. For low temperature measurements the sample was kept in an Oxford ESR 900 helium flow cryostat that allows for temperature control between 6 and 100 K (Oxford ITC4). The microwave frequency was detected with an EIP frequency counter (Microwave Inc.). For determination of g values, the magnetic field was calibrated with an external Li/LiF standard with a known g value of 2.002293 (49Stesmans A. Vangorp G. Rev. Sci. Instrum. 1989; 60: 2949-2952Crossref Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Spin quantifications have been performed by comparing the double integrated signal with the signal of a CuSO4 standard of known concentration. Base-line corrections, if required, were performed by subtracting a background spectrum, obtained under the same experimental conditions from a sample containing only a buffer solution. Simulations of the EPR spectra have been performed with the program EasySpin (50Stoll S. Schweiger A. J. Magn. Res. 2006; 178: 42-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (4101) Google Scholar) that diagonalizes the Spin-Hamiltonian and calculates transition probabilities. FTIR spectra were recorded on a Bruker Tensor 27 spectrometer equipped with a liquid nitrogen-cooled MCT detector with a spectral resolution of 2 cm−1. The sample compartment was purged with dried air, and the sample (0.2–0.5 mm isolated protein, ∼0.05 mm protein attached to the cytoplasmic membrane) was held in a temperature-controlled (10 °C) gas-tight IR-cell for liquid samples (volume ∼7 μl, path length = 50 μm) with CaF2 windows. Spectra were base-line corrected by using a spline function implemented within OPUS 4.2 software of the spectrometer. Reduced protein samples were prepared through incubation under 1 bar H2 or under 0.05 bar H2 in 1 bar gas mixture (95% nitrogen, 5% hydrogen) atmosphere for 20–30 min at room temperature. The iron and nickel contents of solubilized dimeric R. eutropha MBH preparations were quantified by ICP-OES analysis with an Optima 2100 DV from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. The multiple element standard solution XVI (Merck) was used as reference. The cyanide content was determined chemically by distillation and subsequent UV/visible spectroscopic quantification of the formed polymethine according to Ref. 10Pierik A.J. Roseboom W. Happe R.P. Bagley K.A. Albracht S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3331-3337Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar. The redox potentials of bulk protein samples in the “as-isolated” state or after different chemical treatments were measured in a homemade, low volume cell by means of a miniaturized Pt/Ag/AgCl “single-rod” redox electrode (Pt5900, Schott) at room temperature. All potentials cited in the text refer to the standard hydrogen electrode. The MBH dimer was solubilized from the membrane and purified by affinity chromatography as described previously (34Ludwig M. Cracknell J.A. Vincent K.A. Armstrong F.A. Lenz O. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 465-477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). According to SDS-PAGE and subsequent protein staining, the purity of the MBH subunits was estimated to be ∼99%. Metal analysis using ICP-OES revealed a nickel content of 0.7 nickel per protein molecule and an iron content of about 10 ± 2 iron. This is in good agreement with the results of an earlier study (38Schneider K. Patil D.S. Cammack R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 748: 353-361Crossref Scopus (65) Google Scholar) and consistent with the composition of one [NiFe], one [3Fe4S], and two [4Fe4S] as found in oxygen-sensitive standard [NiFe] hydrogenases, e.g. that from Desulfovibrio vulgaris (18Lubitz W. Reijerse E. van Gastel M. Chem. Rev. 2007; 107: 4331-4365Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar, 41Fichtner C. Laurich C. Bothe E. Lubitz W. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 9706-9716Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The metal content reflects an occupancy of 70% for all metal cofactors. Nevertheless, the ratio of iron and nickel meets the expectation. Determination of the cyanide content in the purified MBH revealed 1.8 CN− per protein molecule indicating a standard-like coordination of the iron in the active site, as observed by FTIR spectroscopy, i.e. two cyanides and one CO. Fig. 2 shows 9.5 GHz EPR spectra obtained for the solubilized, dimeric MBH in its oxidized (as isolated) and reduced forms. The spectra taken at 20 K from samples buffered at pH 5.5 and pH 7.0 (Fig. 2, traces b and d) exhibit a complex line shape. The prominent signal at g = 2.0 results from an oxidized [3Fe-4S]+ cluster with an S = 1/2 ground state. The signal consists of a narrow component, similar to that observed for standard [NiFe] hydrogenases (see Fig. 2, trace a), and a superimposed complex broad “split” component (labeled by ▿). The intensity of this broad signal varied between different enzyme preparations, and in some samples, it even exceeded that of the narrow signal. It is interesting to note that the broad signal component was never observed in the spectra of most well studied periplasmic standard hydrogenases such as that from D. vulgaris Miyazaki F (Fig. 2, trace a). Upon mild reduction of the as-isolated MBH dimer sample with 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, the redox potential decreased to +40 mV resulting in a transformation of the complex broad and split EPR signal into a narrow signal, as it is usually observed for an uncoupled [3Fe4S]+ cluster (see supplemental Fig. S1). This narrow signal at g = 2.0 is very similar to that found for the [3Fe4S]+ center in the D. vulgaris Miyazaki F standard [NiFe] hydrogenase (Fig. 2, trace a). At pH 7.0 signals of a Ni(III) species in the active site of the oxidized MBH dimer were detected. The gx and gy values (2.30 and 2.17) agree with those of the Nir-B state observed for standard [NiFe] hydrogenases (Fig. 2, traces a and b) (51Schröder O. Bleijlevens B. de Jongh T.E. Chen Z. Li T.

We describe here a virus-based assay in which fluoromycobacteriophages are used to deliver a GFP or ZsYellow fluorescent marker gene to M. tuberculosis, which can then be monitored by fluorescent detection approaches including fluorescent microscopy and flow cytometry. Pre-clinical evaluations show that addition of either Rifampicin or Streptomycin at the time of phage addition obliterates fluorescence in susceptible cells but not in isogenic resistant bacteria enabling drug sensitivity determination in less than 24 hours. Detection requires no substrate addition, fewer than 100 cells can be identified, and resistant bacteria can be detected within mixed populations. Fluorescence withstands fixation by paraformaldehyde providing enhanced biosafety for testing MDR-TB and XDR-TB infections."
https://openalex.org/W2165012796,"The synaptic serine protease neurotrypsin is essential for cognitive function, as its deficiency in humans results in severe mental retardation. Recently, we demonstrated the activity-dependent release of neurotrypsin from presynaptic terminals and proteolytical cleavage of agrin at the synapse. Here we show that the activity-dependent formation of dendritic filopodia is abolished in hippocampal neurons from neurotrypsin-deficient mice. Administration of the neurotrypsin-dependent 22 kDa fragment of agrin rescues the filopodial response. Detailed analyses indicated that presynaptic action potential firing is necessary for the release of neurotrypsin, whereas postsynaptic NMDA receptor activation is necessary for the neurotrypsin-dependent cleavage of agrin. This contingency characterizes the neurotrypsin-agrin system as a coincidence detector of pre- and postsynaptic activation. As the resulting dendritic filopodia are thought to represent precursors of synapses, the neurotrypsin-dependent cleavage of agrin at the synapse may be instrumental for a Hebbian organization and remodeling of synaptic circuits in the CNS."

Undergraduates made more accurate predictions about their affective reactions to a 5-minute speed date ( n = 25) and to a peer evaluation ( n = 88) when they knew only how another undergraduate had reacted to these events than when they had information about the events themselves.

https://openalex.org/W2019717368,"In the nose, odorants are detected on the cilia of olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs), where a cAMP-mediated signaling pathway transforms odor stimulation into electrical responses. Phosphodiesterase (PDE) activity in OSN cilia has long been thought to account for rapid response termination by degrading odor-induced cAMP. Two PDEs with distinct cellular localization have been found in OSNs: PDE1C in the cilia and PDE4A throughout the cell but absent from the cilia. We disrupted both of these genes in mice and carried out electro-olfactogram analysis. Unexpectedly, eliminating PDE1C did not prolong response termination. Prolonged termination occurred only in mice that lacked both PDEs, suggesting that cAMP degradation by PDE1C in cilia is not a rate-limiting factor for response termination in wild-type mice. Pde1c(-/-) OSNs instead showed reduced sensitivity and attenuated adaptation to repeated stimulation, suggesting that PDE1C may be involved in regulating sensitivity and adaptation. Our observations provide new perspectives on the regulation of olfactory transduction."
https://openalex.org/W2088290460,"Background Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) play a significant role in the fragmentation of myelin basic protein (MBP) and demyelination leading to autoimmune multiple sclerosis (MS) and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). The classic MBP isoforms are predominantly expressed in the oligodendrocytes of the CNS. The splice variants of the single MBP gene (Golli-MBP BG21 and J37) are widely expressed in the neurons and also in the immune cells. The relative contribution of the individual MMPs to the MBP cleavage is not known. Methodology/Principal Findings To elucidate which MMP plays the primary role in cleaving MBP, we determined the efficiency of MMP-2, MMP-8, MMP-9, MMP-10, MMP-12, MT1-MMP, MT2-MMP, MT3-MMP, MT4-MMP, MT5-MMP and MT6-MMP in the cleavage of the MBP, BG21 and J37 isoforms in the in vitro cleavage reactions followed by mass-spectroscopy analysis of the cleavage fragments. As a result, we identified the MMP cleavage sites and the sequence of the resulting fragments. We determined that MBP, BG21 and J37 are highly sensitive to redundant MMP proteolysis. MT6-MMP (initially called leukolysin), however, was superior over all of the other MMPs in cleaving the MBP isoforms. Using the mixed lymphocyte culture assay, we demonstrated that MT6-MMP proteolysis of the MBP isoforms readily generated, with a near quantitative yield, the immunogenic N-terminal 1–15 MBP peptide. This peptide selectively stimulated the proliferation of the PGPR7.5 T cell clone isolated from mice with EAE and specific for the 1–15 MBP fragment presented in the MHC H-2U context. Conclusions/Significance In sum, our biochemical observations led us to hypothesize that MT6-MMP, which is activated by furin and associated with the lipid rafts, plays an important role in MS pathology and that MT6-MMP is a novel and promising drug target in MS especially when compared with other individual MMPs."
https://openalex.org/W2078838212,"Background Genetic and biological evidence supports a role for DISC1 across a spectrum of major mental illnesses, including schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. There is evidence for genetic interplay between variants in DISC1 and in biologically interacting loci in psychiatric illness. DISC1 also associates with normal variance in behavioral and brain imaging phenotypes. Methodology Here, we analyze public domain datasets and demonstrate correlations between variants in the DISC1 pathway genes and levels of gene expression. Genetic variants of DISC1, NDE1, PDE4B and PDE4D regulate the expression of cytoskeletal, synaptogenic, neurodevelopmental and sensory perception proteins. Interestingly, these regulated genes include existing targets for drug development in depression and psychosis. Conclusions Our systematic analysis provides further evidence for the relevance of the DISC1 pathway to major mental illness, identifies additional potential targets for therapeutic intervention and establishes a general strategy to mine public datasets for insights into disease pathways."
https://openalex.org/W1989608036,"Background Type-I interferons, type-II interferons, and the IL-10 family are helical cytokines with similar three-dimensional folds. However, their homologous relationship is difficult to detect on the basis of sequence alone. We have previously described the discovery of the human type-III interferons (IFN lambda-1, -2, -3 or IL-29, IL-28A, IL-28B), which required a combination of manual and computational techniques applied to predicted protein sequences. Principal Findings Here we describe how the use of gene structure analysis and comparative genomics enabled a more extensive understanding of these genes early in the discovery process. More recently, additional mammalian genome sequences have shown that there are between one and potentially nine copies of interferon lambda genes in each genome, and that several species have single exon versions of the interferon lambda gene. Significance The variable number of single exon type-I interferons in mammals, along with recently identified genes in zebrafish homologous to interferons allows a story of interferon evolution to be proposed. This model suggests that the gene duplications and single exon retrotransposons of mammalian type-III interferons are positively selected for within a genome. These characteristics are also shared with the fish interferons and could be responsible for the generation of the IL10 family and also the single exon type-I interferons."
https://openalex.org/W1982189494,"The sexual phase of the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum is accompanied by the coordinated expression of stage-specific adhesive proteins.

IntroductionThe sexual phase of the malaria pathogen Plasmodium falciparum begins with the differentiation of predetermined blood stage parasites to gametocytes in the human host and continues with the formation of male and female gametes in the midgut of the blood-fed female mosquito vector. Subsequently, the motile male microgamete fertilizes the amotile female macrogamete, and within a day after the blood meal, the resulting zygote transforms into an infective ookinete. Gametocytogenesis and gamete formation are accompanied by the coordinated expression of numerous sexual stage proteins (1Alano P. Mol.

Parasitol. 2008; 38: 327-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar).We have recently reported that PfCCp1, PfCCp2, and PfCCp3 co-localize within the parasitophorous vacuole of mature gametocytes (10Pradel G. Wagner C. Mejia C. Templeton T.J. . 2006; 112: 263-268Google Scholar). The three proteins are co-dependently expressed at the protein but not transcript level, leading to the assumption that they might interact during expression in gametocytes and that the loss of one protein results in degradation of the other two (10Pradel G. Wagner C. Mejia C. Templeton T.J. . 2006; 112: 263-268Google Scholar). For this study, we generated novel PfCCp1 and PfFNPA gene-disruptant parasites and show that in gene-disruptant gametocytes lacking PfCCp1, PfCCp2, PfCCp3, PfCCp4, or PfFNPA, the PfCCp proteins were either absent or expressed at a decreased protein level. We further demonstrate that the six proteins undergo intermolecular interactions and are involved in cell binding of the newly emerged macrogametes. In conclusion, we propose that the PfCCp proteins form multi-protein complexes that are exposed during gamete formation and that might mediate cell contacts of macrogametes.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESGene Identifications—The following gene identifiers are assigned to the proteins investigated in this study: Pf39, PF11_0098; PfCCp1, PF14_0723; PfCCp2, PF14_0532; PfCCp3, PF14_0067; PfCCp4, PFI0185w; PfCCp5, PFA0445w; PfFNPA, PF14_0491; and Pfs25, PF10_0303.Oligonucleotides—PfCCp1 5′ SpeI, 5′-ACTAGTTACATGTCTGAAGAGTCC; PfCCp1 5′ BglII, 5′-AGATCTTTACTGATTATCAGTACTTACAG; PfCCp1 3′ ClaI, 5′-ATCGATGCACAC AATTATCTGAATTG; PfCCp1 3′ NcoI, 5′-CCATGGTTAGGATGTTGTTGGGTC; PfFNPA BamHI, 5′-ATGGATCCGGGGTACATGCATTTATG; PfFNPA 5′-NotI, TAGCGGCCGCTTACGTATTGACCCAGTGATT; a, 5′-CTTCTCATCATAAGCATTGGC; b, 5′-CCCGTCCATGTTATTTCTTCATC; b′,5′-CAAAGAAGAAGCTCAGAGATTGC; c, 5′-GTAAGCAAAATGATAATTTAGCAGC; c′,5′-GTTTTGTAATTTATGGGATAGCG; d, 5′-ATGTATGTACCCATCAAACGG; e, 5′-GGAATGTTGAAAAGGAAAATGAGCAG; f, 5′-GCTGCTAAATTATCATTTTGCTTAC; g, 5′-CTGGTATGGACCATTATGTTGGG; h, 5′-CGAAATTACAGAAGAATCAACACCATG; i, 5′-TCGGATGGAGAATCCGTT; j, 5′-GTATCCCATGTCTTGTGA; k, 5′-GCCCTCATGAAACACATGATG; l, 5′-CACATCTCCTGTTGTCGC; m, 5′-ATGCCCGAACAAATCATTAAT; n, 5′-TGCTGAGGCGCATATACT; o, 5′-GGTTCGCGCGATTGGGAT; p, 5′-TTTTCCGCACACAGAATC; q, 5′-CGCTGGATTCAGTGGTAATAACC; r, 5′-CCGTATTGGTCTTTATTGGAG; s, 5′-GGTAATGTATCTACGCCT; t, 5′-AATGATGATGCCCAGGAG; u, 5′-TATTCCTAATCATGTAAATCTTAAA; v, 5′-CAATTAACCCTCACTAAAG; w, 5′-GCAACATCTCTAAGTGATACTGG; x, 5′-TGGTATCCCTGTGTCCCA; y, 5′-CTTGAACACCATGATGTA; and z, 5′-TCCACTTTCATGAGCAGG.Parasite Culture—Mature gametocytes of the P. falciparum NF54 isolate were cultivated in vitro as described (12Ifediba T. Vanderberg J.P. Nature. 1981; 294: 364-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Gametocyte activation and gametogenesis was induced by incubating mature gametocyte cultures in 100 μm xanthurenic acid/PBS, pH 8.5 (13Billker O. Lindo V. Panico M. Etienne A.E. Paxton T. Dell A.

Chem. 1998; 273: 12003-12005Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) or human serum for 15 min at room temperature.Generation of Gene-disruptant Parasites—PfCCp1 gene-disruptant parasites were generated by double homologous recombination using the targeting vector pHHT-TK (ATCC, Manassas, VA) (15Duraisingh M.T. Triglia T. Cowman A.F. Int. J. Parasitol. 2002; 32: 81-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Two fragments of the PfCCp1 gene corresponding to the 5′-and 3′-coding regions of 1,138 and 1,522 bp, respectively, were amplified by PCR from P. falciparum NF54 genomic DNA using the above mentioned primer pairs PfCCp1 5′ SpeI and PfCCp1 5′ BglII as well as PfCCp1 3′ ClaI and PfCCp1 3′ NcoI. These PCR products were sequentially cloned into the restriction sites SpeI/BglII and ClaI/NcoI of the pHHT-TK vector. The gene targeting disruption plasmid was introduced into the P. falciparum isolate NF54 via the erythrocyte-loading method (16Deitsch K.W. Driskill C.L. Wellems T.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 850-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar), and stable transfected parasites that have integrated plasmid by double cross-over homologous recombination were selected with pyrimethamine and ganciclovir (15Duraisingh M.T. Triglia T. Cowman A.F. Int. J. Parasitol. 2002; 32: 81-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). A pyrimethamine-resistant polyclonal line was established, and clones were isolated by limiting dilution. Correct integration of the targeting plasmid into the genomic locus was verified by PCR and Southern blot analyses diagnostic of a disrupted locus. PCR was performed with 100 ng of genomic DNA from wild type or disruptant parasites for 35 cycles of amplification and with an annealing temperature of 50 °C, using the above mentioned primers a, b, b′,c,c′, and d (shown in supplemental Fig. S1). Southern blotting was performed with 10 μg of genomic DNA from wild type or disruptant parasites, digested with KpnI plus BamHI, separated by 0.8% agarose gel electrophoresis, and transferred to Hybond N+ (Amersham Biosciences). A 1.1-kb hybridization probe corresponding to the 5′-coding region of PfCCp1 was amplified with the primers PfCCp1 5′ SpeI and PfCCp1 5′ BglII. The probe was labeled with digoxigenin, and hybridization was performed at 48 °C using a DIG High Prime DNA labeling and detection starter kit II (Roche Applied Science), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Lack of PfCCp1 transcripts in the disruptant clone was confirmed by RT-PCR. RNA from mature wild type and disruptant gametocytes was isolated with TRIzol (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions, treated with DNase I (Invitrogen), and purified on RNeasy MinElute Cleanup columns (Qiagen). RNA was reverse-transcribed using Superscript II that was primed with random hexanucleotides (Invitrogen). PCR was performed for 35 cycles of amplification using the oligonucleotides e and f. The absence of genomic DNA contamination was confirmed by PCR amplification on sham-treated RNA samples that lacked reverse transcriptase. Absence of protein expression was assessed by Western blot and indirect immunofluorescence assay, as described below. Furthermore, PfFNPA gene-disruptant parasites were generated by single homologous recombination using the vector pCAM-BSD (17Sidhu A.B. Valderramos S.G. Fidock D.A. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 57: 913-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar, 18Dorin-Semblat D. Quashie N. Halbert J. Sicard A. Doerig C. Peat E. Ranford-Cartwright L. Doerig C. Mol. Microbiol. 2007; 65: 1170-1180Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). A 568-bp fragment of the PfFNPA gene was amplified by PCR from P. falciparum NF54 genomic DNA using the primer pair PfFNPA BamHI and PfFNPA NotI, which included a stop codon. The PCR product was cloned into the restriction site BamHI/NotI of the pCAM-BSD vector. Further steps were carried out as described above, except that selection of stable transfected parasites, which had integrated plasmid by single cross-over homologous recombination, was pursued using blasticidin. PCR with genomic DNA from wild type or disruptant parasites was performed for 33 cycles of amplification and with annealing temperatures ranging from 42 to 50 °C using the primers s, t, u, and v (shown in supplemental Fig. S2). Southern blotting was carried out with 2 μg of wild type parasites or parasites of the PfFNPA-KO (knock-out) clone 1H4, digested with MfeI and NcoI. A hybridization probe of 825 bp corresponding to the 5′-coding region of PfFNPA was amplified with the primers w and x. Southern blotting was performed as mentioned above, using a hybridization temperature of 35 °C. RNA isolation and transcript level analysis was conducted as below. For RT-PCR oligonucleotides q and r were used as well as Pf39-specific oligonucleotides y and z as a control.Antibodies—The following antibodies were used in this study: mouse antisera against PfCCp1-CC, PfCCp2-Disc, and PfCCp3-SR (7Pradel G.

Parasitol. 1997; 90: 359-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar); and goat antisera against GST tag (Amersham Biosciences) or mouse antisera against His6 tag (GE Healthcare).RNA Isolation and Transcript Level Analysis—Gametocytes were enriched by Percoll gradient purification (20Kariuki M.M. Kiaira J.K. Mulaa F.K. Mwangi J.K. Wasunna M.K. Martin S.K. Am. J. Trop. Med. Hyg. 1998; 59: 505-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), and RNA was isolated using the TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. RNA preparations were treated with RNase-free DNase I (Invitrogen) to remove genomic DNA contamination, followed by phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. Synthesis of cDNA was accomplished using a Superscript II cDNA synthesis kit (Invitrogen). RT-PCR assays were performed with 125 ng of cDNA using gene specific primers by conventional thermocycling (25 cycles) separated by 2% agarose gel electrophoresis. The following primers were used: PfCCp1, g and h; PfCCp2, i and j; PfCCp3, k and l; PfCCp4, m and n; PfCCp5, o and p; and PfFNPA, q and r.Western Blot Analysis—Pellets of enriched gametocytes were resuspended in PBS and SDS-PAGE loading buffer as described (11Scholz S.M. Simon N. Lavazec C. Dude M.A. Templeton T.J. Pradel G. Int. J. Parasitol. 2008; 38: 327-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Parasite proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE electrophoresis and transferred to Hybond ECL nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The membranes were blocked for nonspecific binding by incubation in Tris-buffered saline containing 5% skim milk and 1% bovine serum albumin fraction V, followed by immune recognition for 2 h at room temperature with mouse immune sera specific to PfCCp proteins, Pf39, or to GST- and His6/SUMO fusion partner protein control. After washing, the membranes were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with an alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibody (Sigma-Aldrich) and developed in nitro blue tetrazolium/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate solution (Sigma-Aldrich) for 5–30 min. Scanned blots were processed using Adobe Photoshop CS software.Indirect Immunofluorescence Assay—Activated or nonactivated gametocyte cultures were air dried on slides and fixed for 10 min in -80 °C methanol. For membrane permeabilization and blocking of nonspecific binding, the fixed cells were incubated in 0.01% saponin, 0.5% bovine serum albumin, and 1% neutral goat serum (Sigma-Aldrich) in PBS twice for 30 min each. The preparations were then incubated for 1.5 h at 37 °C with anti-PfCCp mouse immune sera. Binding of primary antibody was visualized using fluorescence-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibodies (Alexa Fluor 488 and 594; Molecular Probes). Counterstaining was performed using 0.05% Evans Blue in PBS for 1 min (Sigma-Aldrich). Labeled specimens were examined by confocal laser scanning microscopy using a Zeiss LSM 510. The digital images were processed using Adobe Photoshop CS software.Co-immunoprecipitation Assay—Enriched gametocytes were lysed in 0.5% saponin in PBS, homogenized, and sonicated for 1 min. The homogenate was centrifuged at 16,000 × g, and prepurification of the supernatant was performed by consecutive incubation with 5% (v/v) preimmune mouse sera and 20 μl of protein G-beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for half an hour each at 4 °C. After centrifugation at 3,400 × g, the supernatant was then incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with 5% (v/v) polyclonal mouse antisera against PfCCp proteins or with antisera against Pf39 as a negative control. A volume of 20 μl of protein G beads was added and incubated for another hour. The beads were then centrifuged, washed five times with PBS, mixed with an equal volume of loading buffer, and loaded onto a 12% SDS gel. Precipitated proteins were then detected via Western blot analysis as described above. To investigate the ability of precipitated PfCCp proteins to bind to recombinant PfCCp adhesion domains, co-immunoprecipitation was performed as described using anti-PfCCp1 antibodies, and the precipitated complex was then incubated with purified recombinant PfCCp3rp3-GST or GST alone, both of which were prepurified with beads as described above, overnight at 4 °C (for expression and affinity purification; see below). The samples were washed five times with PBS and loaded onto 12% or 15% SDS gels. Precipitated proteins were detected via Western blot analysis as described above.Affinity Chromatography Co-elution Binding Assay—Recombinant proteins were expressed as fusion proteins with either a GST tag using the pGEX-4T1 vector (Amersham Biosciences) or a His6/SUMO tag using the pSUMO vector as described (see Fig. 3B for domain specificity) (11Scholz S.M. Simon N. Lavazec C. Dude M.A. Templeton T.J. Pradel G. Int. J. Parasitol. 2008; 38: 327-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Recombinant proteins PfCCp1rp1, PfCCp1rp6, PfCCp3rp1, PfCCp3rp3, PfCCp3rp4, PfCCp4rp4, and Pf39 were tagged with GST and used as bait, whereas the recombinant proteins PfCCp1rp1, PfCCp1rp2, PfCCp1rp3, PfCCp1rp5, PfCCp2rp3, PfCCp2rp4, PfCCp3rp1, PfCCp3rp3, PfCCp5rp1, PfCCp5rp2, and PfFNPA-rp2 were expressed with a His6/SUMO tag and functioned as prey in the affinity chromatography co-elution binding experiments. The proteins were expressed in BL21 (DE3) RIL cells according to the manufacturer's protocol (Stratagene). The GST fusion protein expressing bacteria cells were lysed three times using a French press and 2 min via sonication. The lysed cells were centrifuged at 30,000 × g, and the supernatant was mixed with GST-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) and applied to a Poly-Prep chromatography column (Bio-Rad) at 4 °C. Supernatants containing His6-tagged potential interaction partners were loaded onto the GST fusion protein-bound column. The column was washed five times with PBS. The last washing step was investigated via Western blot analysis for the absence of GST-tagged and His6/SUMO-tagged proteins. The mutual binding abilities were investigated via co-elution, using a 50 mm Tris/HCl elution buffer, pH 8, containing 10 mm reduced glutathione. Via SDS-PAGE electrophoretic separation of eluates, the interaction partners were assayed by Western blot analysis using anti-His6 antibodies (GE Healthcare) and anti-GST antibodies (Amersham Biosciences). Co-elutions of recombinant GST tag protein with His6/SUMO tag protein or of Pf39 protein with PfCCp1rp1 protein were used as negative controls. For binding studies on endogenous PfCCp proteins, GST-tagged PfCCp3rp3 bait protein was applied to the columns. Gametocyte lysate was prepared as described for the co-immunoprecipitation assay, diluted with PBS, and loaded to the bait-bound column. Co-elution binding assays were performed as described above. The elutions were concentrated with Amicon ultra filter devices (Millipore) and analyzed for the presence of PfCCp3rp3-GST and endogenous PfCCp1 proteins by Western blotting. Blotting with antibodies against Pf39 was used as negative control.Latex Bead-mediated Cell Binding Assay—For activation, 5 × 107 carboxylate-modified, yellow-green fluorescent polysterene latex beads with a diameter of 1 μm (Sigma-Aldrich) were incubated in 50 μl of 500 mm MES (2-(N-morpholino)-ethanesulfonic acid; Roth) pH 5–6, 40 μl of 100 mg/ml N-ethyl-N′-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide hydrochloride (Sigma-Aldrich), and 410 μl of H2Obidest for 2 h at room temperature under rotation. After washing twice with 50 mm MES, the beads were conjugated with 5 μg of the recombinant proteins PfCCp3rp1 or PfCCp3rp3 (GST-tagged), PfCCp1rp1 or PfCCp2rp3 (His6/SUMO-tagged), or, as negative controls, with the GST-portion alone or the His6 fusion protein 5-helix (21Koshiba T. Chan D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 7573-7579Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) in 50 mm MES for 2 h at room temperature under rotation. Expression and purification of the recombinant proteins was conducted as described (see Fig. 3B for domain specificity) (11Scholz S.M. Simon N. Lavazec C. Dude M.A. Templeton T.J. Pradel G. Int. J. Parasitol. 2008; 38: 327-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). To remove unbound proteins and block unspecific binding sites, the coated latex beads were washed twice with PBS and incubated overnight in 1% bovine serum albumin, 0.05% Tween 20 in PBS, pH 7.4, at 4 °C, followed by washing three times in PBS. The coated beads were mixed with either nonactivated gametocyte cultures or gametocyte cultures 15 min, 6 h, or 24 h post-activation or with PfCCp3-KO gametocytes 15 min post-activation, which were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde overnight and washed three times in PBS. After incubation overnight at 4 °C, the number of macrogametes (15 min, 6 h, and 24 h post-activation), nonactivated gametocytes and erythrocytes that bound the PfCCp-coated latex beads were counted for 20 optical fields (400× magnification) using an Zeiss Axiophot microscope. This corresponds to a total number of ∼100 gametocytes or gametes and of ∼1000 erythrocytes. In total, two to four independent assays were performed, and the mean values were calculated. The respective cell types were distinguished because of their morphological appearance; mature (stage V) gametocytes were crescent-shaped, and macrogametes were round, contained multiple hemozoin particles, and were smaller and more translucent than erythrocytes. Binding of latex beads to macrogametes was subsequently verified by immunofluorescence assay using antibodies against Pfs25 in combination with Alexa Fluor 596-conjugated secondary antibodies.RESULTSGeneration of Gene-disruptant Parasites—The PfCCp1 and PfFNPA gene loci were disrupted to complete the panel of targeted gene knock-outs of PfCCp family members. The PfCCp1 targeting disruption plasmids were introduced into the P. falciparum isolate NF54, and stable transfected parasites were selected with pyrimethamine and ganciclovir to drive plasmid integration by double cross-over homologous recombination (supplemental Fig. S1) (15Duraisingh M.T. Triglia T. Cowman A.F. Int. J. Parasitol. 2002; 32: 81-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). A pyrimethamine-resistant polyclonal line was established, and clonal lines were isolated by limiting dilution. Correct disruption of PfCCp1 was verified by diagnostic PCR (supplemental Fig. S1). Southern blot analysis of KpnI- and BamHI-digested genomic DNA from wild type and knock-out parasites showed correct disruption of the PfCCp1 locus and confirmed that double cross-over occurred (supplemental Fig. S1). PfCCp1 transcripts were not detected by RT-PCR in the gametocyte stages of disruptant parasites (supplemental Fig. S1), and the lack of PfCCp1 expression was confirmed by Western blot analysis of gametocyte protein extracts isolated from PfCCp1-KO parasites compared with a wild type control (Fig. 1A) and by immunofluorescence assay (supplemental Fig. S1). PfCCp1 gene-disruptant parasites were capable of propagation of asexual intraerythrocytic stages and production of gametocytes comparable with wild type, indicating that PfCCp1 is not essential for intraerythrocytic development. Moreover, gamete emergence and exflagellation of male gametes appeared normal in in vitro emergence assays.FIGURE 1Co-dependent expression of PfCCp proteins. A, Western blot analysis of gametocyte lysates from PfCCp1-KO, PfCCp2-KO, PfCCp3-KO, PfCCp4-KO, and PfFNPA-KO parasite lines using PfCCp-specific mouse antisera. PfCCp1, PfCCp2, PfCCp3, PfCCp5, and PfFNPA proteins are absent in the PfCCp1-KO, PfCCp2-KO, and PfCCp3-KO lines and expressed at a decreased protein level in PfCCp4-KO and PfFNPA-KO parasites. Protein bands migrate at the expected molecular masses of 185 kDa (PfCCp1, PfCCp2), 150 kDa (PfCCp3), 125 kDa (PfCCp5), and 100 kDa (PfFNPA), as indicated by arrowheads. An additional protein band at a molecular mass of 70 kDa was detectable for PfCCp2. Antibodies against the endoplasmic reticulum-associated protein Pf39 (39 kDa) were used as loading control. B, indirect immunofluorescence assay using PfCCp4 mouse antiserum demonstrated that PfCCp4 is expressed in PfCCp1-KO, PfCCp2-KO, PfCCp3-KO, and PfFNPA-KO gametocytes (green). Erythrocytes were counterstained with Evans Blue (red). C, indirect immunofluorescence assay using PfCCp-specific mouse antisera demonstrated that the proteins PfCCp1 through PfFNPA, with the exception of PfCCp4"

We have demonstrated previously that the open reading frame 45 (ORF45) of Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus interacts with p90 ribosomal S6 kinases (RSKs) and strongly stimulates their kinase activities (Kuang, E., Tang, Q., Maul, G. G., and Zhu, F. (2008) J. Virol. 82,1838-1850). Here, we define the mechanism by which ORF45 activates RSKs. We demonstrated that binding of ORF45 to RSK increases the association of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) with RSK, such that ORF45, RSK, and ERK formed high molecular mass protein complexes. We further demonstrated that the complexes shielded active pERK and pRSK from dephosphorylation. As a result, the complex-associated RSK and ERK were activated and sustained at high levels. Finally, we provide evidence that this mechanism contributes to the sustained activation of ERK and RSK in Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus lytic replication.

In mammals, four isoforms are known, RSK1 to RSK4. Each one has two catalytically functional kinase domains, the N-terminal kinase domain (NTKD) and C-terminal kinase domain (CTKD) as well as a linker region between the two. The NTKD is responsible for phosphorylation of exogenous substrates, and the CTKD and linker region regulate RSK activation (1Roux P.P. Blenis J. Microbiol. Mol. Biol.

The active ERK phosphorylates Thr-359/Ser-363 of RSK in the linker region (amino acid numbers refer to human RSK1) and Thr-573 in the CTKD activation loop. The activated CTKD then phosphorylates Ser-380 in the linker region, creating a docking site for 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1. The 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1 phosphorylates Ser-221 of RSK in the activation loop and activates the NTKD. The activated NTKD autophosphorylates the serine residue near the ERK docking site, causing a transient dissociation of active ERK from RSK (25Carriere A. Ray H. Blenis J. Roux P.P. Front.

The stimulation of quiescent cells by a mitogen such as epidermal growth factor or a phorbol ester such as 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) usually results in a transient RSK activation that lasts less than 30 min. RSKs have been implicated in regulating cell survival, growth, and proliferation. Mutation or aberrant expression of RSK has been implicated in several human diseases including Coffin-Lowry syndrome and prostate and breast cancers (1Roux P.P. Blenis J. Microbiol. Mol. Biol.

KSHV is a human DNA tumor virus etiologically linked to Kaposi sarcoma, primary effusion lymphoma, and a subset of multicentric Castleman disease (33Chang Y. Cesarman E. Pessin M.S. Lee F.

Infection and reactivation of KSHV activate multiple MAPK pathways (6Sharma-Walia N. Krishnan H.H. Naranatt P.P. Zeng L. Smith M.S. Chandran B. J.

Noticeably, the ERK/RSK activation is sustained late during KSHV primary infection and reactivation from latency (5Sadagopan S. Sharma-Walia N. Veettil M.V. Raghu H. Sivakumar R. Bottero V.

Maul G.G. Zhu F. J. Virol. 2008; 82: 1838-1850Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), but the mechanism of the sustained ERK/RSK activation is unclear. Recently, we demonstrated that ORF45, an immediate early and also virion tegument protein of KSHV, interacts with RSK1 and RSK2 and strongly stimulates their kinase activities (23Kuang E. Tang Q. Maul G.G. Zhu F. J. Virol. 2008; 82: 1838-1850Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). We also demonstrated that the activation of RSK plays an essential role in KSHV lytic replication (23Kuang E. Tang Q. Maul G.G. Zhu F. J. Virol. 2008; 82: 1838-1850Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). In the present study we determined the mechanism of ORF45-induced sustained ERK/RSK activation. We found that ORF45 increases the association of RSK with ERK and protects them from dephosphorylation, causing sustained activation of both ERK and RSK. Cell Cultures and Reagents—BCBL-1 cells latently infected with KSHV were cultured in RPMI1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. HEK293 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. HEK293-teton-ORF45 is a cell line that expresses ORF45 from a tetracycline-inducible promoter. It was generated by cotransfection of HEK293 cells with linearized pTet-On and pTRE2hyg (Clontech, Mountain View, CA) harboring the ORF45 coding sequence followed by G418 and hygromycin selection. A clone with low background expression and high inducibility was used in our study. Anti-HA and anti-FLAG M2 antibodies, anti-FLAG M2 and anti-HA affinity resins, 3× FLAG and HA peptides, TPA, phosphatase inhibitor cocktails I and II, and protein standards for gel filtration chromatography were purchased from Sigma. Antibodies detecting pRSK (Thr-359/Ser-363), pRSK (Ser-380), pRSK (Thr-573), ERK1/2, MEK1/2, pERK1/2 (Thr-202/Tyr-204), pMEK1/2 (Ser-217/221), and SignalSilence® pool ERK1/2 and control siRNAs were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Danvers, MA). Rat anti-LANA (latency-associated nuclear antigen) antibody was purchased from Advanced Biotechnologies, Inc. (Columbia, MD). Active ERK2, RSK1, RSK2, and phosphatase 2A (PP2A) proteins and rabbit anti-RSK1 and RSK2 antibodies were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (now part of Millipore, Billerica, MA). ORF45 protein, anti-ORF45, and anti-K8 antibodies have been described previously (36Zhu F.X. Chong J.M. Wu L. Yuan Y. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 800-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 37Zhu F.X. King S.M. Smith E.J. Levy D.E. Yuan Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Plasmid Constructs—Plasmids pKH3-RSK2, pKH3-RSK1, pCR3.1-ORF45, FLAG-tagged pCMV-ORF45full-length, and derivatives have been described previously (23Kuang E. Tang Q. Maul G.G. Zhu F. J.

A. 2002; 99: 5573-5578Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). FLAG-tagged Rat RSK1-WT and docking-site deletion constructs were kindly provided by James Maller of the University of Colorado. ERK1 and ERK2 constitutive active and kinase-dead mutant constructs were provided by Shou-Jiang Gao of the University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio and by Melanie H. Cobb of the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blot Analysis—Immunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis were performed as previously described (23Kuang E. Tang Q. Maul G.G. Zhu F. J. Virol. 2008; 82: 1838-1850Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were lysed with whole-cell lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate (Na3VO4), 40 mm β-glycerophosphate, 30 mm sodium fluoride, 10% glycerol, 5 mm EDTA, 1× protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science), and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). For immunoprecipitation with anti-FLAG or anti-HA antibodies, the cell lysates were incubated with EZview red anti-FLAG M2 or anti-HA affinity resin for 4 h or overnight at 4 °C. After washing with the lysis buffer and Tris-buffered saline (TBS: 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl), proteins were eluted by incubation with 150 μg/ml 3× FLAG or HA peptide in TBS for 1 h at 4 °C. For Western blot, about 20 μg of proteins was resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were blocked in 5% dried milk in 1× phosphate-buffered saline plus 0.2% Tween 20 and then incubated with diluted primary antibodies for 2 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C. Anti-rabbit, anti-rat, or anti-mouse IgG antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Pierce) were used as the secondary antibodies. An enhanced chemiluminescence system (Pierce) was used for detection. siRNA—The strategy for knockdown of gene expression in BCBL-1 cells by a retrovirus-based siRNA vector including target sequences for RSK1 and RSK2 has been described previously (23Kuang E. Tang Q. Maul G.G. Zhu F. J. Virol. 2008; 82: 1838-1850Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The two siRNA sequences for ORF45 are siORF45-1 (AGAGAATGCTTCCAATTGA) and siORF45-5 (GACCCACGGTGATAGATAT). The two for the ERK1 are siERK1-1 (AGCTGGATGACCTACCTAA) and siERK1-2 (GCCATGAGAGATGTCATCA). Because ERK2 is not expressed in BCBL-1 cells, 3E. Kuang and F. Zhu, unpublished data. only siRNAs against ERK1 were used to knock down ERK1/2 expression. For transient assays, SignalSilence® pool Erk1/2 and control siRNAs from Cell Signaling Technology were transfected into HEK293 cells with Lipofectamine® 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the protocols suggested by the manufacturer. The off-target effects such as activation of interferon were examined and found to be minimal as we previously described (23Kuang E. Tang Q. Maul G.G. Zhu F. J. Virol. 2008; 82: 1838-1850Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). ATP Depletion—Serum-starved cells were washed once with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and then treated with 20 ng/ml TPA for 10 min. Then ATP depletion was performed as described previously (38Johnson R.A. Huong S.M. Huang E.S. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 1158-1167Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 39Meriin A.B. Yaglom J.A.

Briefly, after TPA treatment, cells were incubated with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5 μm rotenone and 10 mm 2-deoxyglucose at 37 °C for the indicated times. Rotenone, an inhibitor of the respiratory chain, blocks the synthesis of ATP, and 2-deoxyglucose is a competitive inhibitor of glycolysis. This treatment leads to a rapid decrease in cytosolic ATP concentration. After incubation, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, lysed with whole-cell lysis buffer, and analyzed by Western blot. In Vitro Dephosphorylation Assay—Active ERK2, active RSK1, and ORF45 were mixed in a molar ratio of 1:1:5 (150, 200, and 750 ng, respectively) in 25 μl of buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl) and incubated at 4 °C for 30 min. The reaction mixture was adjusted with 10× calf-intestine alkaline phosphatase (CIAP) buffer (500 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 1 mm EDTA) or 5× PP2A reaction buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin); 1 unit CIAP or 0.2 units of PP2A were then added to each reaction. After incubation at 37 °C for 30 min for CIAP or 30 °C for 1 h for PP2A, the reactions were stopped by the addition of 2× Laemmli gel-loading buffer and boiled for 10 min. We also prepared crude cell extracts that contained various phosphatases as described by Wang et al. (40Wang P.Y. Liu P. Weng J. Sontag E. Anderson R.G. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2658-2667Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Briefly, the quiescent HEK293 cells were homogenized in buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1× protease inhibitor mixture). The lysates were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and supernatant was collected as crude extract that contained various phosphatase activities. Thirty μg of the above supernatant fraction were added to the mixtures of ORF45, active ERK, and active pRSK to a total volume of 100 μl in buffer A. The mixtures were incubated at 30 °C, and the reactions were stopped at different time points as described above. Gel Filtration Chromatography—Semiconfluent HEK293-teton-ORF45 cells were treated with 500 ng/ml doxycycline for 3 days to induce ORF45 expression. After induction, the cells were harvested, washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline, resuspended in buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 30 mm NaF, 40 mm glycerophosphate, 5 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 5 μg/ml pepstatin A), and lysed by three rounds of freezing and thawing followed by 10 s of sonication in a micro-ultrasonic cell disrupter. Cell lysates were clarified by ultracentrifuge at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. The cell lysates, purified ORF45, ERK2, RSK1, RSK2, or their mixtures were fractionated on a Superdex 200 HR 10/30 gel filtration column with a Beckman System GOLD HPLC system (GMI, Inc., Ramsey, MN). The HPLC running buffer consisted of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 5 μg/ml pepstatin A. One column volume (24 ml) of eluate was collected in aliquots of 0.5 ml. Fractions were analyzed by Western blot. KSHV ORF45 Increases the Association of RSK with ERK—In previous studies we found that KSHV ORF45 interacts with and significantly increases the activities of RSK1 and RSK2 kinase (23Kuang E. Tang Q. Maul G.G. Zhu F. J. Virol. 2008; 82: 1838-1850Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Efficient RSK activation by ERK requires its association with ERK. ERK associates with RSK through the docking site near the C terminus of RSK in quiescent cells and transiently dissociates upon mitogen stimulation (28Roux P.P. Richards S.A. Blenis J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 4796-4804Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Prolonged association with ERK has been noticed to promote sustained RSK activation (28Roux P.P. Richards S.A. Blenis J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 4796-4804Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), so we examined whether ORF45 could increase the association of ERK and RSK. As shown in Fig. 1A, we found that ERK was coimmunoprecipitated with HA-RSK1 or HA-RSK2 in the presence of ORF45 (Fig. 1A, lanes 5 and 6), but coprecipitation was barely detectable in the absence of ORF45 expression (lanes 2 and 3), suggesting that ORF45 significantly increases the ERK/RSK interaction. In addition, ERK was coprecipitated with ORF45 in the presence of RSK1 (lane 5) or RSK2 (lane 6) but was nearly not in the absence of RSK overexpression (lane 4). These results suggest that ORF45 interacts with ERK indirectly through RSKs. We have shown previously that the N-terminal region of ORF45 binds to RSK and that deletion of amino acids 19-77 abolishes its binding (23Kuang E. Tang Q. Maul G.G. Zhu F. J. Virol. 2008; 82: 1838-1850Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). In contrast to the full-length ORF45, the Δ19-77 deletion mutant was not coprecipitated with either RSK or ERK (Fig. 1B, bottom panel, lane 5). ERK was coprecipitated with HA-RSK2 in the presence of full-length ORF45 but not the Δ19-77 deletion mutant (Fig. 1B, top panel). So the wild-type ORF45 increased the association between RSK2 and ERK as expected, but the Δ19-77 amino acid mutant did not. The results presented in Fig. 1B were obtained with the HA-RSK2 construct, and identical results were obtained with HA-RSK1 (data not shown). These results further support that ORF45 interacts with ERK indirectly, and their association is bridged by RSK. Interestingly, ERK1 and ERK2 were equally expressed, but ERK2 was retained by RSK preferentially in the presence of ORF45 (Fig. 1, B and C). This pattern could explain our previous observation that ERK2 was preferentially activated in HEK293 cells expressing KSHV ORF45 (23Kuang E. Tang Q. Maul G.G. Zhu F. J. Virol. 2008; 82: 1838-1850Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). RSK interacts with ORF45 through its NTKD (23Kuang E. Tang Q. Maul G.G. Zhu F. J. Virol. 2008; 82: 1838-1850Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) and with ERK through its CTKD (27Gavin A.C. Nebreda A.R. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 281-284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 28Roux P.P. Richards S.A. Blenis J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 4796-4804Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 29Smith J.A. Poteet-Smith C.E. Malarkey K. Sturgill T.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2893-2898Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar), but neither NTKD nor CTKD alone could mediate ORF45/ERK interaction; full-length RSK was required (data not shown). A possible scenario is that binding of ORF45 to RSK stabilizes the transient association between RSK and ERK that normally occurs through the C-terminal ERK docking site. If this were the case, the ERK-docking site would be required for the increased ERK/RSK interaction by ORF45. The coimmunoprecipitation assay showed that disruption of the ERK-docking site (deletion of the last 17 amino acid from the C terminus) diminished the binding of ERK to RSK (Fig. 1C, compare lane 3 to lane 2). Furthermore, the ERK docking site deletion mutant (DD) displayed a dominant inhibitory effect on the ERK activation by ORF45 (Fig. 1C, middle panel, compare lane 3 to lane 2). This result suggests that the increased association of ERK with RSK indeed depends on the ERK docking site. Collectively, the above data demonstrate that binding of ORF45 to the RSK increases the association of ERK with RSK and, therefore, that all three form a complex in the cells. To determine whether these components exist in the same complex in cells, we coexpressed FLAG-ORF45 and HA-RSK2 in HEK293 cells for a sequential immunoprecipitation analysis. We first immunoprecipitated FLAG-ORF45 and eluted the immunocomplexes with competing FLAG peptides. RSK2 bound to the eluted ORF45 was then immunoprecipitated with anti-HA resin. We found that endogenous ERK as well as pERK and pRSK were present in the RSK2/ORF45 complexes (Fig. 1D), but MEK was not (data not shown). Similar results were obtained with HA-RSK1 construct (data not shown). These results further support that ORF45, ERK, and RSK form complexes that contain active pRSK and pERK in the cell. Active ERK Is Associated with the ORF45·RSK Complex—To provide further evidence that ORF45, RSK, and ERK form a complex in the cells, we fractionated the lysates of ORF45-expressing HEK293 cells by gel filtration chromatography and analyzed each fraction by Western blot. As shown in Fig. 2A, we found that: 1) KSHV ORF45 protein (407 amino acids) exists mainly in high molecular weight (Mr) complexes (fractions 21-25), although its predicted Mr is only 43.3 kDa (but its apparent Mr on denaturing SDS-PAGE is about 70 kDa (41Zhu F.X. Cusano T. Yuan Y. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 5556-5567Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 42Zhu F.X. Yuan Y. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 4221-4230Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar); 2) RSK1 and RSK2 (both have apparent Mr of 90 kDa) exist in low Mr (fractions 27-31) and high Mr (fractions 21-25) forms; 3) the high Mr RSK proteins cofractionate with ORF45, supporting the conclusion that RSKs and ORF45 are associated with each other in cells; 4) active pERK and pRSK are only detected in fractions where high Mr ORF45 and RSK reside (fractions 21-24), although the majority of ERK1/2 proteins exist in low Mr, presumably nonphosphorylated, monomer form (fractions 31-35); 5) two forms of ORF45 are detected in these cells; the hypophosphorylated form (higher mobility) cofractionates with the high Mr RSK1 and RSK2 (fractions 22-25), and the hyperphosphorylated ORF45 (lower mobility) appears larger in size and cofractionates with pRSK, pERK (fractions 21-23).

https://openalex.org/W2049366846,"The finding that upon neuronal activation glutamate is transported postsynaptically from synaptic clefts and increased lactate availability for neurons suggest that brain mitochondria (BM) utilize a mixture of substrates, namely pyruvate, glutamate, and the tricarboxylic acid cycle metabolites. We studied how glutamate affected oxidative phosphorylation and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in rat BM oxidizing pyruvate + malate or succinate. Simultaneous oxidation of glutamate + pyruvate + malate increased state 3 and uncoupled respiration by 52 and 71%, respectively. The state 4 ROS generation increased 100% over BM oxidizing pyruvate + malate and 900% over that of BM oxidizing glutamate + malate. Up to 70% of ROS generation was associated with reverse electron transport. These effects of pyruvate + glutamate + malate were observed only with BM and not with liver or heart mitochondria. The effects of glutamate + pyruvate on succinate-supported respiration and ROS generation were not organ-specific and depended only on whether mitochondria were isolated with or without bovine serum albumin. With the non-bovine serum albumin brain and heart mitochondria oxidizing succinate, the addition of pyruvate and glutamate abrogated inhibition of Complex II by oxaloacetate. We conclude that (i) during neuronal activation, simultaneous oxidation of glutamate + pyruvate temporarily enhances neuronal mitochondrial ATP production, and (ii) intrinsic inhibition of Complex II by oxaloacetate is an inherent mechanism that protects against ROS generation during reverse electron transport.

Recently, it has emerged that mitochondrial dysfunctions play an important role in the pathogenesis of degenerative diseases of the central nervous system (1Greenamyre J.T. Sherer T.B. Betarbet R. Panov A.V. IUBMB Life. 2001; 52: 135-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar, 2Martin L.J. Liu Z. Chen K. Price A.C. Pan Y. Swaby J.A. Golden W.C. J. Comp.

The processes underlying neuronal degeneration are complex, and some authors suggest that several genetic alterations are involved (4Shaw P.J. J. Neurol. Neurosurg. Psychiatry. 2005; 76: 1046-1057Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). However, another level of complexity may be derived from the fact that virtually all cellular activities depend upon energy metabolism in the cell (5Erecinska M. Nelson D. J. Neurochem. 1994; 63: 1033-1041Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Alterations in energy metabolism processes within cells may also contribute to pathogenic mechanisms underlying neurodegenerative disease. A large body of evidence suggests that increased oxidative stress is an important pathogenic mechanism that promotes neurodegeneration (6Halliwell B. J. Neurochem. 2006; 97: 1634-1658Crossref PubMed Scopus (2077) Google Scholar). Because neurons have a long life span, and most neurodegenerative diseases have a clear association with age (7Bohr V.A. Ottersen O.P. Tonjum T. Neuroscience. 2007; 145: 1183-1186Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), it is important to understand mechanisms underlying reactive oxygen species (ROS) 2The abbreviations used are: ROS, reactive oxygen species; AGC, aspartate-glutamate carrier; BM, brain mitochondria; BSA, bovine serum albumin; CCCP, cyanide-m-chlorophenylhydrazone; α-KG, α-ketoglutarate; α-KGDHC, α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex; MAS, malate aspartate shuttle; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropane sulfonic acid sodium salt; OAA, oxaloacetate; RET, reverse electron transport; SDH, succinate dehydrogenase; TPP+, tetraphenyl phosphonium; RHM, rat heart mitochondria; non-BSA-BM, BM isolated in the absence of BSA. production in neurons. Recently, Kudin et al. (8Kudin A.P. Malinska D. Kunz W.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2008; 1777: 689-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) analyzed the contribution of mitochondria to the total ROS production in brain tissue. They concluded that mitochondria are the major source of ROS and that at least 50% of ROS generated by brain mitochondria was associated with succinate-supported reverse electron transport (RET). Under conditions of normoxia, about 1% of the respiratory chain electron flow was redirected to form superoxide (8Kudin A.P. Malinska D. Kunz W.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2008; 1777: 689-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Recently, we suggested that the organization of the respiratory chain complexes into supercomplexes that occurs in brain mitochondria (BM) (9Schagger H. Pfeiffer K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37861-37867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) may represent one of the intrinsic mechanisms to prevent excessive ROS generation (10Panov A. Dikalov S. Shalbuyeva N. Hemendinger R. Greenamyre J.T. Rosenfeld J. Am. J. Physiol. 2007; 292: C708-C718Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). In this paper, we put forward the hypothesis that inhibition of Complex II by oxaloacetate (OAA) represents another important intrinsic mechanism to prevent oxidative stress. We provide evidence that glutamate and pyruvate specifically exert control over the production of ROS at the level of Complex II. Below we present a brief account of published theoretical and experimental evidence that underlie our hypothesis. The neural processing of information is metabolically expensive (11Attwell D. Laughlin S.B. J. Cereb. Blood Flow Metab. 2001; 21: 1133-1145Crossref PubMed Scopus (2206) Google Scholar). More than 80% of energy is spent postsynaptically to restore the ionic composition of neurons (11Attwell D. Laughlin S.B. J. Cereb. Blood Flow Metab. 2001; 21: 1133-1145Crossref PubMed Scopus (2206) Google Scholar). When neurons are activated, reuptake of glutamate stimulates aerobic glycolysis in astroglial cells (12Pellerin L. Magistretti P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10625-10629Crossref PubMed Scopus (2097) Google Scholar), thereby making lactate the major substrate for neuronal mitochondria (4Shaw P.J. J. Neurol. Neurosurg. Psychiatry. 2005; 76: 1046-1057Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar, 13Hertz L. Peng L. Dienel G.A. J. Cereb. Blood Flow Metab. 2007; 27: 219-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). However, rapid conversion of lactate to pyruvate in neurons requires activation of the malate-aspartate shuttle (MAS). The shuttle is the major pathway for cytosolic reducing equivalents from NADH to enter the mitochondria and be oxidized (14Berkich D.A. Ola M.S. Cole J. Sweatt A.J. Hutson S.M. LaNoue K.F. J. Neurosci. Res. 2007; 85: 3367-3677Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 15McKenna M.C. Waagepetersen H.S. Schousboe A. Sonnewald U. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2006; 71: 399-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). The key component of MAS is the mitochondrial aspartate/glutamate carrier (AGC) (16LaNoue K.F. Schoolwerth A.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1979; 48: 871-922Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar), and recent data suggest that the AGC is expressed mainly in neurons (14Berkich D.A. Ola M.S. Cole J. Sweatt A.J. Hutson S.M. LaNoue K.F. J. Neurosci. Res. 2007; 85: 3367-3677Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Absence of the AGC from astrocytes in the brain implies a compartmentation of intermediary metabolism, with glycolysis taking place in astrocytes and lactate oxidation in neurons (13Hertz L. Peng L. Dienel G.A. J. Cereb. Blood Flow Metab. 2007; 27: 219-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar, 14Berkich D.A. Ola M.S. Cole J. Sweatt A.J. Hutson S.M. LaNoue K.F. J. Neurosci.

Active operation of MAS requires that a certain amount of glutamate must be transported from synaptic clefts into activated neurons. In isolated BM, it has been shown that besides pyruvate, glutamate is also a good respiratory substrate (5Erecinska M. Nelson D. J. Neurochem. 1994; 63: 1033-1041Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 18Yudkoff M. Nelson D. Daikhin Y. Erecinska M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27414-27420Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the presynaptic elements, the concentration of cytosolic glutamate is ∼10 mm at all times (19Kauppinen R.A. Nicholls D.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1986; 158: 159-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Yudkoff et al. (18Yudkoff M. Nelson D. Daikhin Y. Erecinska M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27414-27420Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have shown that synaptosomal mitochondria utilize glutamate and pyruvate as mitochondrial respiratory substrates. Glutamate is also oxidized by the astroglial mitochondria (13Hertz L. Peng L. Dienel G.A. J. Cereb. Blood Flow Metab. 2007; 27: 219-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). Until recently, it was generally accepted that most of the glutamate is rapidly removed from the synaptic cleft by glutamate transporters EAAT1 and EAAT2 located on presynaptic termini and glial cells (20Rothstein J.D. Martin L. Levey A.I. Dykes-Hoberg M. Jin L. Wu D. Nash N. Kuncl R.W. Neuron. 1994; 13: 713-725Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1462) Google Scholar, 21Danbolt N.C. Prog.

However, recent data show that a significant fraction of glutamate is rapidly bound and transported by the glutamate transporter isoform, EAAT4, located juxtasynaptically in the membranes of spines and dendrites (20Rothstein J.D. Martin L. Levey A.I. Dykes-Hoberg M. Jin L. Wu D. Nash N. Kuncl R.W. Neuron. 1994; 13: 713-725Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1462) Google Scholar, 25Dehnes Y. Chaudhry F.A. Ullensvang K.

At the climbing fiber to Purkinje cell synapses in the cerebellum, about 17% (28Brasnjo G. Otis T.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 6273-6278Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) or more than 50% (29Auger C. Attwell D. Neuron. 2000; 28: 547-558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) of synaptically released glutamate may be removed by postsynaptic transporters. Besides the cerebellum, EAAT4 protein was found to be omnipresent throughout the fore- and midbrain regions (30Massie A. Cnops L. Smolders I. McCullumsmith R. Kooijman R. Kwak S. Arckens L. Michotte Y. J. Comp. Neurol. 2008; 511: 155-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Moreover, it was shown that although most of the EAAT2 protein is astroglial, around 15% is distributed in nerve terminals and axons in hippocampal slices and that this protein may be responsible for more than half of the total uptake of glutamate from synaptic clefts (24Furness D.N. Dehnes Y. Akhtar A.Q. Rossi D.J. Hamann M. Grutle N.J. Gundersen V. Holmseth S. Lehre K.P. Ullensvang K. Wojewodzic M. Zhou Y. Attwell D. Danbolt N.C. Neuroscience. 2008; 157: 80-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). These data suggest that postsynaptic transport of glutamate into nerve terminals where mitochondria are located (31Li Z. Okamoto K. Hayashi Y. Sheng M. Cell. 2004; 119: 873-887Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1129) Google Scholar) may occur in all brain regions. According to calculations of Brasnjo and Otis (28Brasnjo G. Otis T.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 6273-6278Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), in a single synapse, EAAT4 (excitatory amino acid transporter 4) binds and transports postsynaptically about 1.3 ± 0.1 × 106 glutamate molecules. In the brain, on average, 1 mm3 of tissue contains 1 × 108 synapses (32Nicholls D.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 212: 613-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 33Abeles M. Corticonics: Neural Circuits of the Cerebral Cortex. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK1991Crossref Google Scholar). Because of the high density of synaptic contacts, the neuronal cells may be exposed to mediators released from hundreds of firing synapses. Thus, in a narrow space of spines and dendrites, several million glutamate molecules postsynaptically transported from synaptic boutons may create local cytosolic concentration of glutamate in the low millimolar range. Consequently, neuronal mitochondria, particularly those located at the axonal or dendritic synaptic junctions, may, in addition to metabolizing pyruvate, temporarily metabolize glutamate and succinate formed during mitochondrial catabolism of γ-aminobutyric acid in postsynaptic cells (34Tillakaratne N.J. Medina-Kauwe L. Gibson K.M. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. A. 1995; 112: 247-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). The purpose of this study was to examine how the neuromediator glutamate affects respiratory activity and ROS generation in nonsynaptic BM when combined with pyruvate and the tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates succinate and malate. We show that with pyruvate + glutamate + malate, the rate of oxidative phosphorylation increased more than 50%, and in resting mitochondria the rate of ROS generation associated with the reverse electron transport increased severalfold. These effects were observed only with brain and spinal cord mitochondria, not with liver or heart mitochondria, suggesting that they may be restricted to neuronal cells. Taken together, the data presented support the hypothesis that in activated neurons, the neuromediator glutamate stimulates mitochondrial ATP production when energy demand is increased. However, in the absence of energy consumption, glutamate + pyruvate may increase the generation of ROS severalfold. We suggest that intrinsic inhibition of Complex II by oxaloacetate is an important natural protective mechanism against ROS associated with reverse electron transport. Animals—All animal use complied with National Institutes of Health guidelines and was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the Carolinas Medical Center. Male Sprague-Dawley rats (180–250 g) from Taconic Farms Inc. (Germantown, NY) were used for isolation of BM. Isolation of Mitochondria—Brain mitochondria were isolated from pooled forebrains of three rats using a modified method of Sims (37Sims N.R. J. Neurochem. 1990; 55: 698-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar), as described in Ref. 10Panov A. Dikalov S. Shalbuyeva N. Hemendinger R. Greenamyre J.T. Rosenfeld J. Am. J. Physiol. 2007; 292: C708-C718Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar. Rat heart and liver mitochondria were isolated as described in Refs. 10Panov A. Dikalov S. Shalbuyeva N. Hemendinger R. Greenamyre J.T. Rosenfeld J. Am. J. Physiol. 2007; 292: C708-C718Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar and 38Panov A. Dikalov S. Shalbueva N. Taylor G. Sherer T. Greenamyer J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 42026-42035Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar. The isolation medium contained 75 mm mannitol, 150 mm sucrose, 20 mm MOPS, pH 7.2, and 1 mm EGTA. For experiments examining effects of defatted bovine serum albumin (BSA), 0.1% BSA was added to the isolation medium. The final suspensions of mitochondria were prepared using a medium containing 75 mm KCl, 125 mm sucrose, and 10 mm MOPS. Mitochondrial protein was determined with the Pierce Coomassie protein assay reagent kit. Simultaneous Measurement of Mitochondrial Respiration and Membrane Potential—Respiratory activities of the mitochondria were measured using a custom-made plastic minichamber of 560 μl volume equipped with a standard YSI (YSI Inc.) oxygen minielectrode connected to a YSI model 5300 Biological Oxygen Monitor, a custom-made tetraphenylphosphonium (TPP+)-sensitive minielectrode, and a KCl bridge to an Ag/AgCl reference electrode connected to a pH meter. All instruments were connected to the data acquisition system. The incubation medium contained 125 mm KCl, 10 mm MOPS, pH 7.2, 2 mm MgCl2, 2 mm KH2PO4, 10 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, and 0.7 mm CaCl2. At a Ca2+/EGTA ratio of 0.7, the free [Ca2+] is close to 1 μm, as determined using Fura-2. The substrate concentrations were as follows: 5 mm succinate without rotenone, 5 mm glutamate, 2.5 mm pyruvate, 10 mm α-ketoglutarate, and 2 mm malate. Oxidative phosphorylation (state 3) was initiated by the addition of 150 μm ADP. The uncoupled respiration (state 3U) was stimulated by titration with CCCP (0.05 μm aliquots) until the maximum rate of oxygen consumption was obtained. Measurements of Hydrogen Peroxide Generation—H2O2 was measured using the Amplex red (Molecular Probes) method as described in Refs. 10Panov A. Dikalov S. Shalbuyeva N. Hemendinger R. Greenamyre J.T. Rosenfeld J. Am. J. Physiol. 2007; 292: C708-C718Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar and 38Panov A. Dikalov S. Shalbueva N. Taylor G. Sherer T. Greenamyer J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 42026-42035Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar. Respiratory inhibitors and uncoupler were added to the incubation media before the addition of mitochondria. The additions of resorufin or standard solutions of H2O2 (Fluka) were used for calibration of the fluorescence scale. Fluorimetric measurements were made using a highly sensitive fluorometer from C&L Co. (Middletown, PA). Data Acquisition—Data acquisition was performed using hardware and software from C&L Co. Chemicals—Sucrose, mannitol, and other chemicals were from Sigma and of molecular biology grade. All solutions were made using glass bidistilled water. Statistics—Comparisons between two groups were made by unpaired t test, and comparisons between more than two groups were made by analyses of variance followed by post hoc tests. Spontaneous Inhibition of Succinate Oxidation—Nonsynaptic BM are commonly isolated with defatted BSA present either in the isolation medium (8Kudin A.P. Malinska D. Kunz W.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2008; 1777: 689-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 10Panov A. Dikalov S. Shalbuyeva N. Hemendinger R. Greenamyre J.T. Rosenfeld J. Am. J. Physiol. 2007; 292: C708-C718Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) or added to the mitochondrial suspension at some stage of the isolation procedure (37Sims N.R. J. Neurochem. 1990; 55: 698-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). It is believed that BSA binds fatty acids and thus prevents their uncoupling effect on BM (39Tretter L. Mayer-Takacs D. Adam-Vizi V. Neurochem. Int. 2007; 50: 139-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). An important feature of BM from Taconic Sprague-Dawley rats isolated with BSA was that 1–2 h postisolation, BM oxidizing succinate stopped responding to the addition of ADP or the uncoupler CCCP. Simultaneous measurements of respiration and membrane potential (ΔΨ) in BM oxidizing succinate showed that the mitochondria remained depolarized after the initiation of ADP phosphorylation (Fig. 1A). When added to BM with inhibited succinate oxidation, glutamate or pyruvate restored normal response to ADP (Fig. 1A). In contrast, when succinate + glutamate (or pyruvate) were present from the beginning, the state 3 respiration and ΔΨ were not impaired (Fig. 1B). At the same time, oxidation of glutamate + malate or pyruvate + malate by the BSA-BM remained stable even 4–5 h after isolation with high respiratory control ratios (data not shown). The fact that pyruvate and glutamate prevented or abolished inhibition of succinate oxidation suggests that the inhibition was associated with OAA. Because BM isolated in the absence of BSA (non-BSA-BM) showed inhibition of succinate dehydrogenase (Complex II) with practically normal rates of glutamate + malate oxidation (35Panov A. Dikalov S. Rosenfeld J. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2006; 41: S167Google Scholar), we analyzed interactions between substrates using non-BSA-BM. Effects of Substrate Mixtures on Respiratory Activity of BM—Fig. 2 shows respiratory activities with the non-BSA-BM exposed to various combinations of respiratory substrates. The results were normalized to the rates seen with pyruvate + malate, which was taken as 100%. Fig. 2A shows that the resting respiration rates (state 4) with glutamate + malate and pyruvate + glutamate + malate were the same as with pyruvate + malate. With succinate, succinate + pyruvate, and succinate + glutamate, the state 4 respiratory rates were correspondingly 159% (p < 0.001), 146% (p < 0.001), and 135% (p < 0.05). When malate was also present, the rate of state 4 declined somewhat, and with succinate alone, malate inhibited the state 4 respiration by 43% (p < 0.001) (Fig. 2A). These relatively small effects of malate on the state 4 oxidation of succinate in the presence of pyruvate or glutamate result in significant inhibition of ROS generation, as shown in Figs. 5 and 6.FIGURE 5Glutamate and pyruvate stimulate the succinate supported H2O2 generation only in the non-BSA-brain mitochondria. Incubation conditions were as in Fig. 1. Final volume was 1 ml. Additions were as follows: 5 μm Amplex red, 3 units of horseradish peroxidase, 50 units of superoxide dismutase (Sigma), 0.1 mg of rat brain mitochondria, 5 mm succinate (S), 5 mm glutamate (G), 2.5 mm pyruvate (P), 2 mm malate (M). Malonate (5 mm) was added before BM. Numbers associated with traces show the rates of H2O2 production in pmol of H2O2/min/mg of BM protein.

S, succinate (5 mm); P, pyruvate (2.5 mm); G, glutamate (5 mm); M, malate (2 mm).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) When BM oxidized pyruvate + glutamate + malate, the rate of oxidative phosphorylation (state 3) increased by 52% (p < 0.001) (Fig. 2B). With succinate alone, the state 3 respiration was only 44% of the control rate with pyruvate + malate (p < 0.001). With succinate + pyruvate or succinate + pyruvate + malate, the state 3 respiration rates increased to 115 and 106%, respectively (Fig. 2B). The increases were not statistically significant when compared with pyruvate + malate but were significantly higher when compared with succinate alone (p < 0.001; not shown). Glutamate or glutamate + malate added to BM oxidizing succinate also increased the state 3 respiration to the level observed with pyruvate + malate. In BM uncoupled with CCCP, O2 utilization in the presence of pyruvate + glutamate + malate was 71% (p < 0.001) higher than with pyruvate + malate (Fig. 2C). The initial rate of succinate oxidation by uncoupled BM was inhibited by 61% (p < 0.001), and the inhibition rapidly increased. It is likely that the inhibition was caused by OAA, which is consistent with the ability of pyruvate and glutamate to release the inhibition of succinate oxidation (Fig. 2C). With succinate alone, malate slightly inhibited the state 3U respiration (Fig. 2C). Response of Rat Heart Mitochondria to Substrate Mixtures— To study whether the effects of the substrate mixtures on respiratory activities, shown in Fig. 2, are specific for the BM only, we conducted similar experiments with mitochondria from rat heart isolated in the absence of BSA. Fig. 3 shows the rates of respiration in different metabolic states of the rat heart mitochondria (RHM). Unlike BM, the rates of oxygen consumption in the presence of pyruvate + glutamate + malate did not increase in RHM. Oxidation of succinate was significantly lower (p < 0.01) as compared with pyruvate + malate. In contrast to BM, with RHM, the rates of succinate oxidation did not depend on whether the mitochondria were isolated in the presence or absence of BSA. Pyruvate and glutamate added separately (data not shown) or together (Fig. 3, B and C) to the RHM oxidizing succinate increased respiration in metabolic states 3 and 3U to levels associated with pyruvate + malate, and the resting respiration (state 4) increased to a level significantly higher than that seen with pyruvate + malate (p < 0.01) (Fig. 3A). Effects of Substrate Mixtures on ROS Production by BM—We studied the effects of substrate mixtures on ROS generation by the non-BSA-BM (Fig. 4A) or BSA-BM (Fig. 4B) supported by glutamate and pyruvate. Fig. 7 summarizes the results of four separate experiments normalized for ROS generation with pyruvate + malate. Figs. 4A and 7 show that with glutamate + malate, generation of ROS was 4.4-fold lower than with pyruvate + malate and 9-fold lower than with pyruvate + glutamate + malate. When non-BSA-BM simultaneously oxidized pyruvate + glutamate + malate, the rate of ROS generation increased more than 2-fold when compared with pyruvate + malate (Fig. 4A). To analyze whether this increase in ROS production was associated with increased RET, we added malonate, an inhibitor of succinate dehydrogenase (SDH). Fig. 4A shows that the addition of 5 mm malonate inhibited ROS production with pyruvate + glutamate + malate by 77%. Malonate also inhibited ROS generation with pyruvate + malate by 50% (not shown) but had no effect on ROS generation with glutamate + malate or 10 mm α-ketoglutarate (α-KG) (data not shown). CCCP had effects similar to those of malonate on ROS generation with pyruvate + malate or pyruvate + glutamate + malate (data not shown). Fig. 4B shows that with the BSA-BM, ROS generation rates were higher than with the non-BSA-BM, but the pattern of the changes seen with the substrate mixtures described above were the same as those seen with the non-BSA-BM.FIGURE 7Generation of H2O2 by non-BSA rat brain mitochondria oxidizing various substrates and substrate mixtures.

https://openalex.org/W2046405351,"It has recently been shown that the epithelial Na(+) channel (ENaC) is compartmentalized in caveolin-rich lipid rafts and that pharmacological depletion of membrane cholesterol, which disrupts lipid raft formation, decreases the activity of ENaC. Here we show, for the first time, that a signature protein of caveolae, caveolin-1 (Cav-1), down-regulates the activity and membrane surface expression of ENaC. Physical interaction between ENaC and Cav-1 was also confirmed in a coimmunoprecipitation assay. We found that the effect of Cav-1 on ENaC requires the activity of Nedd4-2, a ubiquitin protein ligase of the Nedd4 family, which is known to induce ubiquitination and internalization of ENaC. The effect of Cav-1 on ENaC requires the proline-rich motifs at the C termini of the beta- and gamma-subunits of ENaC, the binding motifs that mediate interaction with Nedd4-2. Taken together, our data suggest that Cav-1 inhibits the activity of ENaC by decreasing expression of ENaC at the cell membrane via a mechanism that involves the promotion of Nedd4-2-dependent internalization of the channel."
https://openalex.org/W2063403629,"Atypical protein kinase Cs (PKCs) (aPKCzeta and lambda/iota) have emerged as important binding partners for ceramide, a membrane-resident cell signaling lipid that is involved in the regulation of apoptosis as well as cell polarity. Using ceramide overlay assays with proteolytic fragments of PKCzeta and vesicle binding assays with ectopically expressed protein, we show that a protein fragment comprising the carboxyl-terminal 20-kDa sequence of PKCzeta (C20zeta, amino acids 405-592) bound to C16:0 ceramide. This sequence is not identical to the C1 domain (amino acids 131-180), which has been suggested to serve as a potential ceramide binding domain. Using immunocytochemistry, we found that a C20zeta protein fragment ectopically expressed in two epithelial cell types (neural progenitors and Madin-Darby canine kidney cells) co-distributed with ceramide. Stable expression of C20zeta-EGFP in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells disrupted the formation of adherens and tight junctions and impaired the epithelium integrity by reducing transepithelial electrical resistance. Disruption of cell adhesion and loss of transepithelial electrical resistance was prevented by incubation with C16:0 ceramide. Our results show, for the first time, that there is a novel ceramide binding domain (C20zeta) in the carboxyl terminus of aPKC. Our results also show that the interaction of ceramide with this binding domain is essential for cell-to-cell contacts in epithelia. Therefore, ceramide interaction with the C20zeta binding domain is a potential mechanism by which ceramide and aPKC regulate the formation of junctional complexes in epithelial cells."
https://openalex.org/W1985261601,"Large-scale gene expression studies have mainly focused on highly expressed and 'discriminatory' genes to decipher key regulatory processes. Biological responses are consequence of the concerted action of gene regulatory network, thus, limiting our attention to genes having the most significant variations is insufficient for a thorough understanding of emergent whole genome response. Here we comprehensively analyzed the temporal oligonucleotide microarray data of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulated macrophages in 4 genotypes; wildtype, Myeloid Differentiation factor 88 (MyD88) knockout (KO), TIR-domain-containing adapter-inducing interferon-beta (TRIF) KO and MyD88/TRIF double KO (DKO). Pearson correlations computed on the whole genome expression between different genotypes are extremely high (>0.98), indicating a strong co-regulation of the entire expression network. Further correlation analyses reveal genome-wide response is biphasic, i) acute-stochastic mode consisting of small number of sharply induced immune-related genes and ii) collective mode consisting of majority of weakly induced genes of diverse cellular processes which collectively adjust their expression level. Notably, temporal correlations of a small number of randomly selected genes from collective mode show scalability. Furthermore, in collective mode, the transition from large scatter in expression distributions for single ORFs to smooth linear lines emerges as an organizing principle when grouping of 50 ORFs and above. With this emergent behavior, the role of MyD88, TRIF and novel MyD88, TRIF-independent processes for gene induction can be linearly superposed to decipher quantitative whole genome differential control of transcriptional and mRNA decay machineries. Our work demonstrates genome-wide co-regulated responses subsequent to specific innate immune stimulus which have been largely neglected."

https://openalex.org/W2038500345,"Hepassocin (HPS), is a liver-specific gene with mitogenic activity on isolated hepatocytes. It is up-regulated following partial hepatectomy and down-regulated frequently in heptocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, very little is known about the HPS transcription regulation mechanism. In this study, we identified HNF1alpha (hepatocyte nuclear factor-1alpha) as an important liver-specific cis-acting element for HPS using in vivo luciferase assays. Deletion of the HNF1 binding site not only led to a complete loss of HPS promoter activity in vivo but also abolished the induction of the HPS promoter by HNF1alpha. An electrophoretic mobility shift assay demonstrated that HNF1alpha interacted with the HPS gene promoter in vitro. Chromatin immunoprecipitation showed that HNF1alpha interacted with HMGB1 and CREB-binding protein, and all of them were recruited to the HPS promoter in vivo. Moreover, HNF1alpha expression was lower in HCC cell lines and tissues and correlated significantly with the down-regulation of HPS expression. Re-expression of HNF1alpha in human hepatoma HepG2 cells reinduced HPS expression. In contrast, knockdown of endogenous HNF1alpha expression by small interfering RNA resulted in a significant reduction of HPS expression. Furthermore, we found that partial hepatectomy and IL-6 significantly induced promoter activity of HPS, depending on STAT3 and HNF1 binding sites in the HPS promoter. These results demonstrate that the HNF1 binding site and HNF1alpha are critical to liver-specific expression of HPS, and down-regulation or loss of HNF1alpha causes, at least in part, the transcriptional down-regulation of HPS in HCC."
https://openalex.org/W2018823212,"In Alzheimer disease (AD), frontotemporal dementia and parkinsonism linked to chromosome 17 (FTDP-17) and other tauopathies, tau accumulates and forms paired helical filaments (PHFs) in the brain. Tau isolated from PHFs is phosphorylated at a number of sites, migrates as approximately 60-, 64-, and 68-kDa bands on SDS-gel, and does not promote microtubule assembly. Upon dephosphorylation, the PHF-tau migrates as approximately 50-60-kDa bands on SDS-gels in a manner similar to tau that is isolated from normal brain and promotes microtubule assembly. The site(s) that inhibits microtubule assembly-promoting activity when phosphorylated in the diseased brain is not known. In this study, when tau was phosphorylated by Cdk5 in vitro, its mobility shifted from approximately 60-kDa bands to approximately 64- and 68-kDa bands in a time-dependent manner. This mobility shift correlated with phosphorylation at Ser(202), and Ser(202) phosphorylation inhibited tau microtubule-assembly promoting activity. When several tau point mutants were analyzed, G272V, P301L, V337M, and R406W mutations associated with FTDP-17, but not nonspecific mutations S214A and S262A, promoted Ser(202) phosphorylation and mobility shift to a approximately 68-kDa band. Furthermore, Ser(202) phosphorylation inhibited the microtubule assembly-promoting activity of FTDP-17 mutants more than of WT. Our data indicate that FTDP-17 missense mutations, by promoting phosphorylation at Ser(202), inhibit the microtubule assembly-promoting activity of tau in vitro, suggesting that Ser(202) phosphorylation plays a major role in the development of NFT pathology in AD and related tauopathies."
https://openalex.org/W2147899598,"Mice lacking the protein phosphatase 1 gamma isoforms, PP1γ1 and PP1γ2, are male-sterile due to defective germ cell morphogenesis and apoptosis. However, this deficiency causes no obvious abnormality in other tissues. A biochemical approach was employed to learn how expression versus deficiency of PP1γ2, the predominant PP1 isoform in male germ cells, affects spermatogenesis. Methods used in this study include column chromatography, western blot and northern blot analyses, GST pull-down assays, immunoprecipitation, non-denaturing gel electrophoresis, phosphatase enzyme assays, protein sequencing, and immunohistochemistry. We report for the first time that in wild-type testis, PP1γ2 forms an inactive complex with actin, protein phosphatase 1 regulatory subunit 7 (PPP1R7), and protein phosphatase 1 regulatory subunit 11 (PPP1R11), the latter, a potent PP1 inhibitor. Interestingly, PPP1R11 protein, but not its mRNA level, falls significantly in PP1γ-null testis where mature sperm are virtually absent. Conversely, both mature sperm numbers and the PPP1R11 level increase substantially in PP1γ-null testis expressing transgenic PP1γ2. PPP1R11 also appears to be ubiquitinated in PP1γ-null testis. The levels of PP1γ2 and PPP1R11 were increased in phenotypically normal PP1α-null testis. However, in PP1α-null spleen, where PP1γ2 normally is not expressed, PPP1R11 levels remained unchanged. Our data clearly show a direct reciprocal relationship between the levels of the protein phosphatase isoform PP1γ2 and its regulator PPP1R11, and suggest that complex formation between these polypeptides in testis may prevent proteolysis of PPP1R11 and thus, germ cell apoptosis."
https://openalex.org/W2084797469,"Sox10 is a member of the group E Sox transcription factor family and plays key roles in neural crest development and subsequent cellular differentiation. Sox10 binds to regulatory sequences in target genes via its conserved high mobility group domain. In most cases, Sox10 exerts its transcriptional effects in concert with other DNA-binding factors, adaptor proteins, and nuclear import proteins. These interactions can lead to synergistic gene activation and can be cell type-specific. In earlier work, we demonstrated that Sox10 transactivates the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor alpha3 and beta4 subunit genes and does so only in neuronal-like cell lines, raising the possibility that Sox10 mediates its effects via interactions with co-regulatory factors. Here we describe the identification of the armadillo repeat-containing protein, ARMCX3, as a Sox10-interacting protein. Biochemical analyses indicate that ARMCX3 is an integral membrane protein of the mitochondrial outer membrane. Others have shown that Sox10 is a nucleocytoplasmic shuttling protein. We extend this observation and demonstrate that, in the cytoplasm, Sox10 is peripherally associated with the mitochondrial outer membrane. Both Sox10 and ARMCX3 are expressed in mouse brain and spinal cord as well as several cell lines. Overexpression of ARMCX3 increased the amount of mitochondrially associated Sox10. In addition, although ARMCX3 does not possess intrinsic transcriptional activity, it does enhance transactivation of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor alpha3 and beta4 subunit gene promoters by Sox10. These results suggest that Sox10 is a membrane-associated factor whose transcriptional function is increased by direct interactions with ARMCX3 and raise the possibility of a signal transduction cascade between the nucleus and mitochondria through Sox10/ARMCX3 interactions."
https://openalex.org/W1973449881,"Sideslip force, longitudinal force, rolling moment, and pitching moment generated by tethered fruit flies, Drosophila melanogaster, were measured during optomotor reactions within an electronic flight simulator. Forces and torques were acquired by optically measuring the angular deflections of the beam to which the flies were tethered using a laser and a photodiode. Our results indicate that fruit flies actively generate both sideslip and roll in response to a lateral focus of expansion (FOE). The polarity of this behavior was such that the animal's aerodynamic response would carry it away from the expanding pattern, suggesting that it constitutes an avoidance reflex or centering response. Sideslip forces and rolling moments were sinusoidal functions of FOE position, whereas longitudinal force was proportional to the absolute value of the sine of FOE position. Pitching moments remained nearly constant irrespective of stimulus position or strength, with a direction indicating a tonic nose-down pitch under tethered conditions. These experiments expand our understanding of the degrees of freedom that a fruit fly can actually control in flight."

Moreover, this duality of function is spatially separated and depends on amino acid side-chain character. Accordingly, residues critical for CaM binding are positively charged and clustered toward the C terminus, and those essential for the maintenance of autoinhibition are hydrophobic and more N-terminal.

Ca2+ concentrations inside the cell are held ∼100 nm, despite a perpetually higher level of 1–2 mm in the extracellular medium. This steep gradient across the plasma membrane allows for a large influx when Ca2+ channels open, with subsequent signaling events that often rely on transduction via Ca2+-binding proteins (3.Bootman M.D. Collins T.J.

Multifunctional in its downstream effects, CaM can bind to at least 300 target proteins with novel partners continuing to be discovered (5.Shen X. Valencia C.A. Szostak J.W. Dong B. Liu R. Proc.

The list of effectors includes two isoforms of the adenylyl cyclase (AC) superfamily, AC1 and AC8, which comprise the Ca2+-stimulable subset of the nine particulate ACs (6.Cooper D.M.F. Mons N. Karpen J.W. Nature. 1995; 374: 421-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar). In intact cells, AC8 exhibits a predilection for store-operated, or capacitative, Ca2+ entry (CCE) (7.Cooper D.M.F.

Although the mechanism of the regulation of AC8 in nonexcitable cells by CCE (or voltage-gated Ca2+ entry in neurons) can be viewed to rely on facets of cellular compartmentalization (11.Smith K.E.

The broad features of CaM that hold the key to its multiple regulatory strategies are understood. CaM is organized into two homologous globular domains (or lobes) united by a short linker segment (14.Babu Y.S. Sack J.S. Greenhough T.J. Bugg C.E. Means A.R. Cook W.J. Nature. 1985; 315: 37-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (791) Google Scholar). Both the N-terminal (N-lobe) and the C-terminal lobe (C-lobe) include two EF-hands (specialized Ca2+-coordinating helix-loop-helix motifs (15.Kretsinger R.H. Nockolds C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 3313-3326Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)), endowing CaM with four Ca2+-binding sites. Ca2+ binding to either lobe of CaM induces a structural reconfiguration determined by the two helices of each EF-hand separating from near-antiparallel to perpendicular arrays (14.Babu Y.S. Sack J.S.

This exposes hydrophobic trenches in the C- and N-lobes sequentially (because the former has the highest affinity for Ca2+), which are notably lined with a disproportionate number of flexible methionine side chains, ready to accommodate a remarkable array of unrelated sequences. Initially, the mode of Ca2+-loaded CaM association with targets was considered to be uniform; the N- and C-lobes collapsed around the target peptides of e.g. smooth muscle myosin light chain kinase (17.Meador W.E.

Science. 1993; 262: 1718-1721Crossref PubMed Scopus (610) Google Scholar) with the N-lobe favoring the C-terminal target sequence and vice versa. However, CaM has since proven to be more versatile and unpredictable in how it associates with and regulates effectors, with reports of N-lobe-N-terminal/C-lobe-C-terminal interaction (20.Osawa M. Tokumitsu H. Swindells M.B. Kurihara H. Orita M. Shibanuma T. Furuya T. Ikura M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 819-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar), target dimerization promoted by CaM (21.Schumacher M.A. Rivard A.F. Bachinger H.P. Adelman J.P. Nature. 2001; 410: 1120-1124Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar), CaM binding to fatty acyl modifications (22.Matsubara M. Nakatsu T. Kato H. Taniguchi H. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 712-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), and other deviations from the early model. Nevertheless, three main forms of CaM regulation have been proposed as follows: relief of autoinhibition; active site remodeling; and dimerization of target domains (23.Hoeflich K.P. Ikura M. Cell. 2002; 108: 739-742Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar). Whether the precise mechanism of CaM binding and subsequent regulation of AC8 falls into these categories of CaM regulation is not resolved. A previous study (24.Gu C. Cooper D.M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8012-8021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) established that AC8 possesses two calmodulin-binding domains (CaMBDs). CaM recognition sequences generally show little homology, although classifications based on relative positions of key hydrophobic residues have been usefully applied (4.Rhoads A.R. Friedberg F. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 331-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (731) Google Scholar). The N-terminal CaMBD of AC8 conforms to a “1-5-8-14 motif” having large hydrophobic side chains from Trp, Val, or Ile residues at these spatially conserved sites. The C-terminal CaMBD contains an IQ-like motif (IQlm), in accordance with a signature (IVL)QXXXR(K) arrangement, to which CaM binds directly (25.Ihling C. Schmidt A. Kalkhof S. Schulz D.M. Stingl C. Mechtler K. Haack M. Beck-Sickinger A.G. Cooper D.M.F. Sinz A. J. Am. Soc. Mass Spectrom. 2006; 17: 1100-1113Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). By truncating one terminus or both termini, Gu and Cooper (24.Gu C. Cooper D.M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8012-8021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) asserted that the N terminus contributed little to direct CaM regulation of AC8, whereas the C terminus was critical for the maintenance of an auto-inhibited state, which was relieved upon binding of CaM. Thus, functional elements of both autoinhibition and pre-association, imparted by noncontiguous CaMBDs, have been suggested, thereby excluding AC8 from a simple model of CaM binding to an autoinhibitory domain leading to activation, as is sometimes observed (23.Hoeflich K.P. Ikura M. Cell. 2002; 108: 739-742Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar). Recently, the proposal that the two CaMBDs play separate roles in AC8 activation was reinforced (26.Simpson R.E. Ciruela A. Cooper D.M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 17379-17389Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). This study suggested that CaM tethering by the N-terminal 1-5-8-14 motif provides the catalytically relevant C-terminal CaMBD with privileged access to CaM, thereby circumventing the need for AC8 to compete for CaM, whose free concentration in the cell is far exceeded by that of its targets (27.Black D.J. Tran Q.K. Persechini A. Cell Calcium. 2004; 35: 415-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 28.Persechini A. Cronk B. J. Biol.

Ikura M. Cell. 2002; 108: 739-742Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar), so the use by AC8 of a 1-5-8-14 motif as a CaM-tethering site is unusual. The proposal that CaM pre-associates here was based on limited mutagenesis of residues within the 1-5-8-14 motif of AC8 and the use of CaM mutants whose Ca2+ binding capability was abolished completely or limited to discrete lobes. In contrast to the 1-5-8-14 motif at the N terminus, very little is known of the IQlm at the C terminus, in terms of the roles of the individual residues in CaM binding or autoinhibition, or even on the interplay between CaMBDs at the N and C termini of AC8. Against this background, the present study sought to assess the contribution of IQlm residues to the function of AC8, focusing on consequences of key mutations on CaM-binding efficiency, regulation by Ca2+/CaM, and maintenance of the autoinhibited state. Through this series of experiments, the level of coordination between the IQ-like and 1-5-8-14 motifs became evident. The provision of a pre-associated CaM molecule was found to allow for potentially deleterious mutations of the IQlm to be tolerated. Within this latter motif, Leu1196, Val1197, and Leu1200 are residues essential to autoinhibition, whereas the main responsibility of binding CaM directly at the C terminus lies with Arg1202 and Arg1204. In this regard, the AC8 IQlm spatially separates the two functions of CaM binding and maintenance of autoinhibition, a separation that is supported by a predicted break in the helicity of the IQlm region. Thus, a new variation is revealed in the manner by which a target exploits the CaM device into a sophisticated activation mechanism. All materials were purchased from Sigma with exceptions as noted.

Lobe-specific Ca2+-binding mutant CaM constructs were a gift from J. H. Caldwell (University of Colorado Health Sciences Center, Denver, CO). Oligonucleotides were from Sigma Genosys. Wild-type rat CaM cDNA was inserted into the pQE30 vector as described recently (26.Simpson R.E. Ciruela A. Cooper D.M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 17379-17389Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). pGEX4T1–8Ct was produced as detailed elsewhere (26.Simpson R.E. Ciruela A. Cooper D.M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 17379-17389Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). A cDNA fragment encoding the first 179 residues of the protein was amplified by PCR using the following primers, (5′ to 3′) GGGAGCTCATGGAACTCTCGGATGTGCACTGC (5′) and CGCGTCGACTTACTCCGATTTGCGCCTCTGG (3′), and subcloned into pMALp4G plasmid using the appropriate restriction enzymes, SacI (5′) and SalI (3′). Amino acid substitution mutants of AC8 were produced by site-directed mutagenesis, using the QuikChange® kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). C-terminal truncation mutants were produced via a PCR-based strategy, using AC8 internal EcoRV and XbaI sites, by 5′ and 3′ primers, respectively. A table detailing the primers used to generate 11 IQlm and four truncation mutants is provided in supplemental Table 1. AC838–40,49–51alaVQR/AAA was created by using the same primers as for AC8VQR/AAA but starting with AC838–40,49–51ala (26.Simpson R.E. Ciruela A. Cooper D.M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 17379-17389Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) as template. XL10 Gold Escherichia coli cells, transformed with wild-type or mutant rat CaM pQE30 plasmids, were grown at 37 °C with vigorous agitation until the absorbance at 600 nm (A600) reached ∼0.8. Expression of the His6-tagged CaM was then induced with 1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside and maintained for 6 h. Cell suspensions were centrifuged at 6000 × g, 4 °C for 15 min, and the supernatant was discarded and the resulting pellet resuspended in cell disruption buffer (140 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.8, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mm benzamidine). Lysates were produced by passing the sample twice through a constant cell disruption apparatus (Constant Cell Systems, Daventry, UK). After lysis, samples were heated to 65 °C for 10 min and then centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C to sediment cell debris and insoluble endogenous protein aggregates. His6-CaM was then purified using immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography (TALON®, Clontech). The expression of GST, GST-8Ct, GST-8C2b, and GST-8C2b mutant proteins in BL21 (DE3) cells for 3 h at 30 °C was induced with 0.1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. Cells were lysed by sonication in lysis buffer (PBS supplemented with 1 mm benzamidine, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μm EDTA, and 1 ng of DNase). Homogenates were then centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, and the pellet discarded. The supernatant fraction was passed through glutathione-Sepharose resin by chromatography and washed until no protein remained in the eluate (assessed by absorbance at 280 nm). A volume of PBS equal to the resin volume was used to create 50% slurry, to which 0.02% (v/v) NaN3 was added. BL21 (DE3) cells transformed with pMALp4G-8Nt1 plasmids were cultured, and expression of MBP-8Nt was instigated by treatment with 0.1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 3 h at 30 °C. Lysis was performed as described above under “Generation of GST and GST Fusion Protein Glutathione-Sepharose Matrices.” Supernatant fractions were snap-frozen on dry ice before storage at −80 °C. HEK293 cells (European Collection of Cell Cultures, Porton Down, UK) were grown in minimum essential medium with Earle's salts, supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, 50 μg/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, and 100 μg/ml neomycin. Cultures were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2. Transient transfection of wild-type and mutant AC8 was achieved using the calcium phosphate method (29.Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4799) Google Scholar). Cells were passaged such that 30–40% confluence was reached on the day of transfection. An 8-h incubation with transfection material was standard. For cell population studies, transfected cultures were seeded into 24-well plates for 24 h, and assay was performed 48 h post-transfection. For in vitro AC assays, crude membrane fractions were extracted, as described previously (26.Simpson R.E. Ciruela A. Cooper D.M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 17379-17389Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), 48 h after transfection. Determination of adenylyl cyclase activity in vitro was performed as detailed elsewhere (30.Boyajian C.L. Garritsen A. Cooper D.M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4995-5003Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), with some modifications. Free Ca2+ concentrations were established from a series of CaCl2 solutions buffered with 200 μm EGTA, based on the BAD4 program (31.Brooks S.P. Storey K.B. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 201: 119-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar) and confirmed by spectrofluorometric measurements with fura-2 and fura-FF as described previously (26.Simpson R.E. Ciruela A. Cooper D.M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 17379-17389Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). [3H]cAMP (∼6000 cpm) was added as a recovery marker, and the [32P]cAMP formed was quantified using a sequential chromatography technique described previously (32.Salomon Y. Londos C. Rodbell M. Anal. Biochem. 1974; 58: 541-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (3367) Google Scholar). cAMP accumulation in intact cells was measured according to the method of Evans et al. (33.Evans T. Smith M.M. Tanner L.I. Harden T.K. Mol. Pharmacol. 1984; 26: 395-404PubMed Google Scholar), with some modifications as described previously (26.Simpson R.E. Ciruela A. Cooper D.M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 17379-17389Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Transfected HEK293 cells were incubated in minimal essential medium with [2-3H]adenine (1.5 μCi/well in 24-well plates) at 37 °C for 90 min to radiolabel the ATP pool. To observe the effect of CCE, cells were preincubated for 4 min with 100 nm TG in the presence of EGTA and isobutylmethylxanthine, and cAMP accumulation was measured over a 1-min period beginning with the addition of various concentrations of CaCl2 and 10 μm FSK. Both the [3H]ATP and [3H]cAMP content were quantified, following sequential chromatography. Accumulation of cAMP is expressed as the percentage conversion of [3H]ATP into [3H]cAMP. For pulldown assays assessing CaM binding to GST, GST-8C2b, and GST-8C2b mutants, glutathione-Sepharose 4B supporting the appropriate immobilized GST or GST fusion was added to PBS supplemented with 0.1% Triton X-100 (v/v), 0.5 μm His6-CaM, and 20 μm CaCl2. Samples were rotated for 2 h at 4 °C, centrifuged (19,000 × g, 5 min, 4 °C), and washed three times in PBS. This was followed by SDS-PAGE analysis and Western blotting with CaM, AC8, and GST antibodies, as detailed below (see under “Immunoblotting”). For GST-8Ct/GST-8C2b pulldown of MBP-8Nt from bacterial lysates, the procedure was identical, except supernatant fractions from bacterial lysis were used in place of PBS as the starting medium. Procedures were performed at room temperature unless stated otherwise. Proteins were resolved using discontinuous SDS-PAGE with a 5% acrylamide stacking gel and a 10, 12, or 15% acrylamide separating gel. Separated proteins were then transferred to a supported nitrocellulose membrane. After transfer, nitrocellulose membranes were optionally washed in Ponceau stain to visualize protein and then blocked for 1 h in TBS (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl) containing 5% nonfat dried milk. Membranes were incubated with anti-GST (1:50,000) or anti-MBP (1:50,000) for 30 min, or anti-CaM (1:5000) or anti-AC8 (1:5000) for 1 h, in TTBS (TBS plus 0.1% Tween 20) containing 1% nonfat dried milk. Membranes were washed (three times for 5 min) in TTBS and then incubated with goat anti-mouse IgG (after monoclonal CaM, GST, and MBP primary antibodies) conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (1:10,000 dilution of stock) or goat anti-rabbit IgG (for polyclonal AC8 primary antibody) conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (1:10,000) in TTBS plus 1% nonfat dried milk for 30 min (GST, MBP) or 1 h (CaM, AC8). Finally, the membranes were washed three times in TTBS (5 min), once in TBS, and subjected to ECL, in accordance with the manufacturer's guidelines. When required, after the first ECL stage, membranes were stripped using Re-blot Plus Strong solution according to the manufacturer's protocol, blocked again in TBS containing 5% nonfat dried milk, and re-probed using the same procedure described above. Sigmoidal dose-response curves were obtained using GraphPad Prism version 4 (GraphPad Software Inc.). Data points of representative experiments are shown as means ± S.D. of triplicate determinations. Mean maximal Ca2+/CaM stimulation of three or more experiments are expressed as mean ± S.E. Statistical significance of differences in mean maximal stimulation between AC8 and AC8Δ1–106 IQlm mutants was assessed with unpaired t tests. One-way ANOVAs were used where appropriate, followed by Dunnett's or Newman-Keuls multiple comparisons tests, where p < 0.05 (*) and p < 0.01 (**) were considered significant. The gross domain topology of AC8 is schematized in Fig. 1A. The C2b region of AC8 performs at least three functions, including binding of CaM, allowing subsequent regulation by CaM, and maintenance of autoinhibition. Whether or how these functions are divided within the C-terminal sequence is unknown. Earlier truncation experiments had concluded that the main autoinhibitory element of AC8 lies between residues 1184 and 1248 (24.Gu C. Cooper D.M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8012-8021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Because the IQlm, potentially important in regulation by CaM, lies between residues Val1197 and Asn1212, we wondered whether an autoinhibitory domain might follow in the subsequent C-terminal sequence. Hence, four truncation mutants were generated as follows: the first three representing successive 12 amino acid deletions from the C terminus, and the final one also truncating the entire IQ-like motif. Arrows on the schematic diagram of AC8 in Fig. 1A at the C2b region indicate truncation points of the four numbered mutants. Mutant cDNAs were transiently transfected into HEK293 cells, from which crude membrane fractions were extracted, and in vitro AC activity was assessed in the presence of 1 μm CaM and varying concentrations of Ca2+free. Fig. 1B shows a representative data set from three such experiments and demonstrates the Ca2+/CaM stimulation of AC8Δ1, AC8Δ2, and AC8Δ3 to be analogous to that of wild-type AC8. As reported previously, Ca2+-stimulated WT-AC8 activity in this heterologous system is usually from 5- to 11-fold over basal (26.Simpson R.E. Ciruela A. Cooper D.M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 17379-17389Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Aggregated maximal stimulation by Ca2+/CaM shows that WT-AC8, AC8Δ1, AC8Δ2, and AC8Δ3 all display activation in this range (8.3 ± 2.0, 7.6 ± 3.1, 8.3 ± 3.4, and 7.2 ± 2.1; mean ± S.E.), but AC8Δ4 falls dramatically short of the lower limit (1.5 ± 0.2). By one-way analysis of variance, AC8Δ4 is the only mutant to significantly differ from WT-AC8 (supplemental Fig. 1A). However, activity of the AC8Δ4 is not eliminated, because robust FSK-induced stimulation, comparable with that of WT, is still observed (Fig. 1C). When the Ca2+ stimulation of WT and mutant ACs is expressed as a percentage of FSK activity over three experiments, AC8Δ4 is the only mutant to be significantly compromised (supplemental Fig. 1B). Although the in vitro assay used above allows us to examine directly the effect of prescribed Ca2+ and CaM concentrations on AC/mutant activity, intact cell cAMP accumulation measurement provide information from a more physiological context, where [CaM] is limiting. Thus, the truncation mutants were also assessed in cell populations for their response to CCE, the mode of Ca2+ entry to which AC8 preferentially responds. CCE was triggered by pretreatment with EGTA and the sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase inhibitor TG. Subsequent application of CaCl2 to the extracellular medium initiated CCE (exemplar traces depicting the resultant [Ca2+]i rise(s) in supplemental Fig. 2A). Having pre-labeled the ATP pool with [3H]adenine, accumulation of radiolabeled cAMP could be quantified. Fig. 1D shows a representative data set, where the robust stimulation typical of AC8-transfected cells contrasts with a lack of Ca2+ activation observed in empty vector-transfected cells. Although the absolute levels of activity varied somewhat, the stimulation profiles of AC8Δ1, AC8Δ2, and AC8Δ3 closely match that of WT-AC8 in terms of the graded increases in cAMP accumulation in response to increasing external Ca2+ and the ratio of basal to maximal activity. Again, AC8Δ4 stood apart from the other truncation mutants; a strikingly high basal activity was observed, which was refractory to further stimulation by Ca2+. These data, together with the in vitro data, allowed us to conclude that residues 11"
https://openalex.org/W2052271019,"Fibrils play an important role in the pathogenesis of amyloidosis; however, the underlying mechanisms of the growth process and the structural details of fibrils are poorly understood. Crucial in the fibril formation of prion proteins is the stacking of PrP monomers. We previously proposed that the structure of the prion protein fibril may be similar as a parallel left-handed beta-helix. The beta-helix is composed of spiraling rungs of parallel beta-strands, and in the PrP model residues 105-143 of each PrP monomer can contribute two beta-helical rungs to the growing fibril. Here we report data to support this model. We show that two cyclized human PrP peptides corresponding to residues 105-124 and 125-143, based on two single rungs of the left-handed beta-helical core of the human PrP(Sc) fibril, show spontaneous cooperative fibril growth in vitro by heterologous stacking. Because the structural model must have predictive value, peptides were designed based on the structure rules of the left-handed beta-helical fold that could stack with prion protein peptides to stimulate or to block fibril growth. The stimulator peptide was designed as an optimal left-handed beta-helical fold that can serve as a template for fibril growth initiation. The inhibiting peptide was designed to bind to the exposed rung but frustrate the propagation of the fibril growth. The single inhibitory peptide hardly shows inhibition, but the combination of the inhibitory with the stimulatory peptide showed complete inhibition of the fibril growth of peptide huPrP-(106-126). Moreover, the unique strategy based on stimulatory and inhibitory peptides seems a powerful new approach to study amyloidogenic fibril structures in general and could prove useful for the development of therapeutics."
