https://openalex.org/W2166043619,"Oligodendrocytes form myelin sheaths and provide metabolic support to axons. Using in vivo genetic fate tracing in a mouse model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), this study shows that there is extensive degeneration of oligodendrocytes near motor neurons prior to behavioral manifestation of disease. Although oligodendrocytes were regenerated from resident progenitors, they failed to mature and restore myelin, a feature also observed in brain and spinal cord tissue from ALS patients. Selective deletion of ALS-linked mutant SOD1 from the oligodendrocyte lineage greatly delayed disease onset, suggesting that this mutant protein impairs their ability to support motor neurons. Oligodendrocytes associate with axons to establish myelin and provide metabolic support to neurons. In the spinal cord of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) mice, oligodendrocytes downregulate transporters that transfer glycolytic substrates to neurons and oligodendrocyte progenitors (NG2+ cells) exhibit enhanced proliferation and differentiation, although the cause of these changes in oligodendroglia is unknown. We found extensive degeneration of gray matter oligodendrocytes in the spinal cord of SOD1 (G93A) ALS mice prior to disease onset. Although new oligodendrocytes were formed, they failed to mature, resulting in progressive demyelination. Oligodendrocyte dysfunction was also prevalent in human ALS, as gray matter demyelination and reactive changes in NG2+ cells were observed in motor cortex and spinal cord of ALS patients. Selective removal of mutant SOD1 from oligodendroglia substantially delayed disease onset and prolonged survival in ALS mice, suggesting that ALS-linked genes enhance the vulnerability of motor neurons and accelerate disease by directly impairing the function of oligodendrocytes."
https://openalex.org/W2015824469,"Background Most meta-analyses include data from one or more small studies that, individually, do not have power to detect an intervention effect. The relative influence of adequately powered and underpowered studies in published meta-analyses has not previously been explored. We examine the distribution of power available in studies within meta-analyses published in Cochrane reviews, and investigate the impact of underpowered studies on meta-analysis results. Methods and Findings For 14,886 meta-analyses of binary outcomes from 1,991 Cochrane reviews, we calculated power per study within each meta-analysis. We defined adequate power as ≥50% power to detect a 30% relative risk reduction. In a subset of 1,107 meta-analyses including 5 or more studies with at least two adequately powered and at least one underpowered, results were compared with and without underpowered studies. In 10,492 (70%) of 14,886 meta-analyses, all included studies were underpowered; only 2,588 (17%) included at least two adequately powered studies. 34% of the meta-analyses themselves were adequately powered. The median of summary relative risks was 0.75 across all meta-analyses (inter-quartile range 0.55 to 0.89). In the subset examined, odds ratios in underpowered studies were 15% lower (95% CI 11% to 18%, P<0.0001) than in adequately powered studies, in meta-analyses of controlled pharmacological trials; and 12% lower (95% CI 7% to 17%, P<0.0001) in meta-analyses of controlled non-pharmacological trials. The standard error of the intervention effect increased by a median of 11% (inter-quartile range −1% to 35%) when underpowered studies were omitted; and between-study heterogeneity tended to decrease. Conclusions When at least two adequately powered studies are available in meta-analyses reported by Cochrane reviews, underpowered studies often contribute little information, and could be left out if a rapid review of the evidence is required. However, underpowered studies made up the entirety of the evidence in most Cochrane reviews."
https://openalex.org/W2024751825,"Richard Lifton, Véronique Frémeaux-Bacchi and colleagues report that recessive mutations in DGKE cause atypical hemolytic-uremic syndrome with an early age of onset progressing to chronic kidney disease. The authors propose that loss of DGKE results in a prothrombotic state that underlies disease pathogenesis. Pathologic thrombosis is a major cause of mortality. Hemolytic-uremic syndrome (HUS) features episodes of small-vessel thrombosis resulting in microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia and renal failure1. Atypical HUS (aHUS) can result from genetic or autoimmune factors2 that lead to pathologic complement cascade activation3. Using exome sequencing, we identified recessive mutations in DGKE (encoding diacylglycerol kinase ɛ) that co-segregated with aHUS in nine unrelated kindreds, defining a distinctive Mendelian disease. Affected individuals present with aHUS before age 1 year, have persistent hypertension, hematuria and proteinuria (sometimes in the nephrotic range), and develop chronic kidney disease with age. DGKE is found in endothelium, platelets and podocytes. Arachidonic acid–containing diacylglycerols (DAG) activate protein kinase C (PKC), which promotes thrombosis, and DGKE normally inactivates DAG signaling. We infer that loss of DGKE function results in a prothrombotic state. These findings identify a new mechanism of pathologic thrombosis and kidney failure and have immediate implications for treating individuals with aHUS."

https://openalex.org/W2044530452,"Fresh fruits and vegetables can harbor large and diverse populations of bacteria. However, most of the work on produce-associated bacteria has focused on a relatively small number of pathogenic bacteria and, as a result, we know far less about the overall diversity and composition of those bacterial communities found on produce and how the structure of these communities varies across produce types. Moreover, we lack a comprehensive view of the potential effects of differing farming practices on the bacterial communities to which consumers are exposed. We addressed these knowledge gaps by assessing bacterial community structure on conventional and organic analogs of eleven store-bought produce types using a culture-independent approach, 16 S rRNA gene pyrosequencing. Our results demonstrated that the fruits and vegetables harbored diverse bacterial communities, and the communities on each produce type were significantly distinct from one another. However, certain produce types (i.e., sprouts, spinach, lettuce, tomatoes, peppers, and strawberries) tended to share more similar communities as they all had high relative abundances of taxa belonging to the family Enterobacteriaceae when compared to the other produce types (i.e., apples, peaches, grapes, and mushrooms) which were dominated by taxa belonging to the Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, and Proteobacteria phyla. Although potentially driven by factors other than farming practice, we also observed significant differences in community composition between conventional and organic analogs within produce types. These differences were often attributable to distinctions in the relative abundances of Enterobacteriaceae taxa, which were generally less abundant in organically-grown produce. Taken together, our results suggest that humans are exposed to substantially different bacteria depending on the types of fresh produce they consume with differences between conventionally and organically farmed varieties contributing to this variation."

https://openalex.org/W2079557795,"The authors show that the strengthening of excitatory inputs onto nucleus accumbens D2 medium spiny neurons (D2-MSNs) correlates with a weak motivation to self-administer cocaine in mice. Silencing or activating D2-MSNs enhances or suppresses the motivation to self-administer cocaine, respectively, suggesting that this pathway constrains compulsive drug seeking behaviors. A hallmark of addiction is the loss of control over drug intake, which is seen in only a fraction of those exposed to stimulant drugs such as cocaine. The cellular mechanisms underlying vulnerability or resistance to compulsive drug use remain unknown. We found that individual variability in the development of highly motivated and perseverative behavior toward cocaine is associated with synaptic plasticity in medium spiny neurons expressing dopamine D2 receptors (D2-MSNs) in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) of mice. Potentiation of glutamatergic inputs onto indirect pathway D2-MSNs was associated with resilience toward compulsive cocaine seeking. Inhibition of D2-MSNs using a chemicogenetic approach enhanced the motivation to obtain cocaine, whereas optogenetic activation of D2-MSNs suppressed cocaine self-administration. These results indicate that recruitment of D2-MSNs in NAc functions to restrain cocaine self-administration and serves as a natural protective mechanism in drug-exposed individuals."
https://openalex.org/W2087197424,"Wesley Warren and colleagues report the whole-genome sequence of the platyfish, Xiphophorus maculatus, providing the first genome of a poeciliid fish. They provide a resource for this model organism used to study traits including viviparity, complex behaviors, pigmentation and cancer, and their comparative analysis provides insights into evolutionary adaptations in natural teleost populations. Several attributes intuitively considered to be typical mammalian features, such as complex behavior, live birth and malignant disease such as cancer, also appeared several times independently in lower vertebrates. The genetic mechanisms underlying the evolution of these elaborate traits are poorly understood. The platyfish, X. maculatus, offers a unique model to better understand the molecular biology of such traits. We report here the sequencing of the platyfish genome. Integrating genome assembly with extensive genetic maps identified an unexpected evolutionary stability of chromosomes in fish, in contrast to in mammals. Genes associated with viviparity show signatures of positive selection, identifying new putative functional domains and rare cases of parallel evolution. We also find that genes implicated in cognition show an unexpectedly high rate of duplicate gene retention after the teleost genome duplication event, suggesting a hypothesis for the evolution of the behavioral complexity in fish, which exceeds that found in amphibians and reptiles."
https://openalex.org/W1964320147,"The main familial focal epilepsies are autosomal dominant nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy, familial temporal lobe epilepsy and familial focal epilepsy with variable foci. A frameshift mutation in the DEPDC5 gene (encoding DEP domain-containing protein 5) was identified in a family with focal epilepsy with variable foci by linkage analysis and exome sequencing. Subsequent pyrosequencing of DEPDC5 in a cohort of 15 additional families with focal epilepsies identified 4 nonsense mutations and 1 missense mutation. Our findings provided evidence of frequent (37%) loss-of-function mutations in DEPDC5 associated with a broad spectrum of focal epilepsies. The implication of a DEP (Dishevelled, Egl-10 and Pleckstrin) domain-containing protein that may be involved in membrane trafficking and/or G protein signaling opens new avenues for research."
https://openalex.org/W2006926570,"Fragile X syndrome (FXS), the most common monogenic cause of inherited intellectual disability and autism, is caused by the silencing of the FMR1 gene, leading to the loss of fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP), a synaptically expressed RNA-binding protein regulating translation. The Fmr1 knockout model recapitulates the main traits of the disease. Uncontrolled activity of metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5) and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling seem crucial in the pathology of this disease. The endocannabinoid system (ECS) is a key modulator of synaptic plasticity, cognitive performance, anxiety, nociception and seizure susceptibility, all of which are affected in FXS. The cannabinoid receptors CB1 (CB1R) and CB2 (CB2R) are activated by phospholipid-derived endocannabinoids, and CB1R-driven long-term regulation of synaptic strength, as a consequence of mGluR5 activation, is altered in several brain areas of Fmr1 knockout mice. We found that CB1R blockade in male Fmr1 knockout (Fmr1(-/y)) mice through pharmacological and genetic approaches normalized cognitive impairment, nociceptive desensitization, susceptibility to audiogenic seizures, overactivated mTOR signaling and altered spine morphology, whereas pharmacological blockade of CB2R normalized anxiolytic-like behavior. Some of these traits were also reversed by pharmacological inhibition of mTOR or mGluR5. Thus, blockade of ECS is a potential therapeutic approach to normalize specific alterations in FXS."
https://openalex.org/W2102801447,"Despite recent studies showing that inhibition of autophagy depletes the hematopoietic stem cell pool and increases intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), it remains unknown whether autophagy is essential in the maintenance of other stem cells. Moreover, it is unclear whether and how the aberrant ROS increase causes depletion of stem cells. Here we report that ablation of FIP200 (also known as Rb1cc1), a gene essential for autophagy induction in mammalian cells, results in a progressive loss of neural stem cells (NSCs) and impairment in neuronal differentiation specifically in the postnatal brain, but not the embryonic brain, in mice. The defect in maintaining the postnatal NSC pool was caused by p53-dependent apoptotic responses and cell cycle arrest. However, the impaired neuronal differentiation was rescued by treatment with the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine but not by p53 inactivation. These data reveal that FIP200-mediated autophagy contributes to the maintenance and functions of NSCs through regulation of oxidative state."
https://openalex.org/W1984387620,"Typical 2-Cys peroxiredoxins (Prxs) react rapidly with H2O2 to form a sulfenic acid, which then condenses with the resolving cysteine of the adjacent Prx in the homodimer or reacts with another H2O2 to become hyperoxidized. Hyperoxidation inactivates the Prx and is implicated in cell signaling. Prxs vary in susceptibility to hyperoxidation. We determined rate constants for disulfide formation and hyperoxidation for human recombinant Prx2 and Prx3 by analyzing the relative proportions of hyperoxidized and dimeric products using mass spectrometry as a function of H2O2 concentration (in the absence of reductive cycling) and in competition with catalase at a fixed concentration of H2O2. This gave a second order rate constant for hyperoxidation of 12,000 M(-1) s(-1) and a rate constant for disulfide formation of 2 s(-1) for Prx2. A similar hyperoxidation rate constant for Prx3 was measured, but its rate of disulfide formation was ~10-fold higher, making it is more resistant than Prx2 to hyperoxidation. There are two active sites within the homodimer, and at low H2O2 concentrations one site was hyperoxidized and the other present as a disulfide. Prx with two hyperoxidized sites formed progressively at higher H2O2 concentrations. Although the sulfenic acid forms of Prx2 and Prx3 are ~1000-fold less reactive with H2O2 than their active site thiols, they react several orders of magnitude faster than most reduced thiol proteins. This observation has important implications for understanding the mechanism of peroxide sensing in cells."
https://openalex.org/W2077654178,"Since the preindustrial era, the average surface ocean pH has declined by 0.1 pH units and is predicted to decline by an additional 0.3 units by the year 2100. Although subtle, this decreasing pH has profound effects on the seawater saturation state of carbonate minerals and is thus predicted to impact on calcifying organisms. Among these are the scleractinian corals, which are the main builders of tropical coral reefs. Several recent studies have evaluated the physiological impact of low pH, particularly in relation to coral growth and calcification. However, very few studies have focused on the impact of low pH at the global molecular level. In this context we investigated global transcriptomic modifications in a scleractinian coral (Pocillopora damicornis) exposed to pH 7.4 compared to pH 8.1during a 3-week period. The RNAseq approach shows that 16% of our transcriptome was affected by the treatment with 6% of upregulations and 10% of downregulations. A more detailed analysis suggests that the downregulations are less coordinated than the upregulations and allowed the identification of several biological functions of interest. In order to better understand the links between these functions and the pH, transcript abundance of 48 candidate genes was quantified by q-RT-PCR (corals exposed at pH 7.2 and 7.8 for 3 weeks). The combined results of these two approaches suggest that pH≥7.4 induces an upregulation of genes coding for proteins involved in calcium and carbonate transport, conversion of CO2 into HCO3− and organic matrix that may sustain calcification. Concomitantly, genes coding for heterotrophic and autotrophic related proteins are upregulated. This can reflect that low pH may increase the coral energy requirements, leading to an increase of energetic metabolism with the mobilization of energy reserves. In addition, the uncoordinated downregulations measured can reflect a general trade-off mechanism that may enable energy reallocation."
https://openalex.org/W2051234852,"The factors that account for the differences in the economic productivity of urban areas have remained difficult to measure and identify unambiguously. Here we show that a microscopic derivation of urban scaling relations for economic quantities vs. population, obtained from the consideration of social and infrastructural properties common to all cities, implies an effective model of economic output in the form of a Cobb-Douglas type production function. As a result we derive a new expression for the Total Factor Productivity (TFP) of urban areas, which is the standard measure of economic productivity per unit of aggregate production factors (labor and capital). Using these results we empirically demonstrate that there is a systematic dependence of urban productivity on city population size, resulting from the mismatch between the size dependence of wages and labor, so that in contemporary US cities productivity increases by about 11% with each doubling of their population. Moreover, deviations from the average scale dependence of economic output, capturing the effect of local factors, including history and other local contingencies, also manifest surprising regularities. Although, productivity is maximized by the combination of high wages and low labor input, high productivity cities show invariably high wages and high levels of employment relative to their size expectation. Conversely, low productivity cities show both low wages and employment. These results shed new light on the microscopic processes that underlie urban economic productivity, explain the emergence of effective aggregate urban economic output models in terms of labor and capital inputs and may inform the development of economic theory related to growth."
https://openalex.org/W2163764443,"The lysine acetyltransferases play crucial but complex roles in cancer development. GCN5 is a lysine acetyltransferase that generally regulates gene expression, but its role in cancer development remains largely unknown. In this study, we report that GCN5 is highly expressed in non-small cell lung cancer tissues and that its expression correlates with tumor size. We found that the expression of GCN5 promotes cell growth and the G1/S phase transition in multiple lung cancer cell lines. Further study revealed that GCN5 regulates the expression of E2F1, cyclin D1, and cyclin E1. Our reporter assays indicated that the expression of GCN5 enhances the activities of the E2F1, cyclin D1, and cyclin E1 promoters. ChIP experiments suggested that GCN5 binds directly to these promoters and increases the extent of histone acetylation within these regions. Mechanistic studies suggested that GCN5 interacts with E2F1 and is recruited by E2F1 to the E2F1, cyclin D1, and cyclin E1 promoters. The function of GCN5 in lung cancer cells is abrogated by the knockdown of E2F1. Finally, we confirmed that GCN5 regulates the expression of E2F1, cyclin D1, and cyclin E1 and potentiates lung cancer cell growth in a mouse tumor model. Taken together, our results demonstrate that GCN5 specifically potentiates lung cancer growth by directly promoting the expression of E2F1, cyclin D1, and cyclin E1 in an E2F1-dependent manner. Our study identifies a specific and novel function of GCN5 in lung cancer development and suggests that the GCN5-E2F1 interaction represents a potential target for lung cancer treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2171775868,"Methylthiolation by radical SAM enzymes is thought to include the sacrificial breakdown of a second Fe-S cluster to generate the sulfur cosubstrate. A biochemical, spectroscopic and structural study of two methylthiotransferases shows these enzymes retain their clusters, using exogenous thiols to modify their targets. How living organisms create carbon-sulfur bonds during the biosynthesis of critical sulfur-containing compounds is still poorly understood. The methylthiotransferases MiaB and RimO catalyze sulfur insertion into tRNAs and ribosomal protein S12, respectively. Both belong to a subgroup of radical–S-adenosylmethionine (radical-SAM) enzymes that bear two [4Fe-4S] clusters. One cluster binds S-adenosylmethionine and generates an Ado• radical via a well-established mechanism. However, the precise role of the second cluster is unclear. For some sulfur-inserting radical-SAM enzymes, this cluster has been proposed to act as a sacrificial source of sulfur for the reaction. In this paper, we report parallel enzymological, spectroscopic and crystallographic investigations of RimO and MiaB, which provide what is to our knowledge the first evidence that these enzymes are true catalysts and support a new sulfation mechanism involving activation of an exogenous sulfur cosubstrate at an exchangeable coordination site on the second cluster, which remains intact during the reaction."
https://openalex.org/W2032014096,"In this study, the authors show that a sodium/solute co-transporter–like protein, SLC5A11, is expressed in a subset of R4 ellipsoid body neurons in Drosophila and is involved in the detection of the nutritive value of sugars. Flies that lack functional SLC5A11 exhibit sugar preference on the basis of concentration. Animals can determine the nutritional value of sugar without the influence of taste. We examined a Drosophila mutant that is insensitive to the nutritional value of sugars, responding only to the concentration (that is, sweetness). The affected gene encodes a sodium/solute co-transporter–like protein, designated SLC5A11 (or cupcake), which is structurally similar to mammalian sodium/glucose co-transporters that transport sugar across the intestinal and renal lumen. However, SLC5A11 was prominently expressed in 10–13 pairs of R4 neurons of the ellipsoid body in the brain and functioned in these neurons for selecting appropriate foods."
https://openalex.org/W1492626232,"Gerhard Krönke and his colleagues show that PPARβ/δ regulates Wnt signaling in osteoblasts, which in turn determines the proper ratio of OPG to RANKL and thus bone homeostasis. They go on to show that pharmacological activation of this receptor normalizes bone density in a mouse model of osteoporosis. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) act as metabolic sensors and central regulators of fat and glucose homeostasis1. Furthermore, PPARγ has been implicated as major catabolic regulator of bone mass in mice and humans2,3,4,5. However, a potential involvement of other PPAR subtypes in the regulation of bone homeostasis has remained elusive. Here we report a previously unrecognized role of PPARβ/δ as a key regulator of bone turnover and the crosstalk between osteoblasts and osteoclasts. In contrast to activation of PPARγ, activation of PPARβ/δ amplified Wnt-dependent and β-catenin–dependent signaling and gene expression in osteoblasts, resulting in increased expression of osteoprotegerin (OPG) and attenuation of osteoblast-mediated osteoclastogenesis. Accordingly, PPARβ/δ-deficient mice had lower Wnt signaling activity, lower serum concentrations of OPG, higher numbers of osteoclasts and osteopenia. Pharmacological activation of PPARβ/δ in a mouse model of postmenopausal osteoporosis led to normalization of the altered ratio of tumor necrosis factor superfamily, member 11 (RANKL, also called TNFSF11) to OPG, a rebalancing of bone turnover and the restoration of normal bone density. Our findings identify PPARβ/δ as a promising target for an alternative approach in the treatment of osteoporosis and related diseases."
https://openalex.org/W1990954164,"Microcephaly-capillary malformation (MIC-CAP) syndrome is characterized by severe microcephaly with progressive cortical atrophy, intractable epilepsy, profound developmental delay and multiple small capillary malformations on the skin. We used whole-exome sequencing of five patients with MIC-CAP syndrome and identified recessive mutations in STAMBP, a gene encoding the deubiquitinating (DUB) isopeptidase STAMBP (STAM-binding protein, also known as AMSH, associated molecule with the SH3 domain of STAM) that has a key role in cell surface receptor-mediated endocytosis and sorting. Patient cell lines showed reduced STAMBP expression associated with accumulation of ubiquitin-conjugated protein aggregates, elevated apoptosis and insensitive activation of the RAS-MAPK and PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathways. The latter cellular phenotype is notable considering the established connection between these pathways and their association with vascular and capillary malformations. Furthermore, our findings of a congenital human disorder caused by a defective DUB protein that functions in endocytosis implicates ubiquitin-conjugate aggregation and elevated apoptosis as factors potentially influencing the progressive neuronal loss underlying MIC-CAP syndrome."
https://openalex.org/W2071748710,"Packaging of DNA into chromatin affects accessibility of DNA regulatory factors involved in transcription, replication, and repair. Evidence suggests that even in the nucleosome core particle (NCP), accessibility to damaged DNA is hindered by the presence of the histone octamer. Base excision repair is the major pathway in mammalian cells responsible for correcting a large number of chemically modified bases. We have measured the repair of site-specific uracil and single nucleotide gaps along the surface of the NCP. Our results indicate that removal of DNA lesions is greatly dependent on their rotational and translational positioning in NCPs. Significantly, the rate of uracil removal with outwardly oriented DNA backbones is 2–10-fold higher than those with inwardly oriented backbones. In general, uracils with inwardly oriented backbones farther away from the dyad center of the NCP are more accessible than those near the dyad. The translational positioning of outwardly oriented gaps is the key factor driving gap filling activity. An outwardly oriented gap near the DNA ends exhibits a 3-fold increase in gap filling activity as compared with one near the dyad with the same rotational orientation. Near the dyad, uracil DNA glycosylase/APE1 removes an outwardly oriented uracil efficiently; however, polymerase β activity is significantly inhibited at this site. These data suggest that the hindrance presented by the location of a DNA lesion is dependent on the structural requirements for enzyme catalysis. Therefore, remodeling at DNA damage sites in NCPs is critical for preventing accumulation of aborted intermediates and ensuring completion of base excision repair.

https://openalex.org/W2032505174,"Tubulointerstitial fibrosis (TIF) is the final common pathway in the end-stage renal disease. Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is considered a major contributor to the TIF by increasing the number of myofibroblasts. Curcumin, a polyphenolic compound derived from rhizomes of Curcuma, has been shown to possess potent anti-fibrotic properties but the mechanism remains elusive. We found that curcumin inhibited the EMT as assessed by reduced expression of α-SMA and PAI-1, and increased E-cadherin in TGF-β1 treated proximal tubular epithelial cell HK-2 cells. Both of the conventional TGF-β1/Smad pathway and non-Smad pathway were investigated. Curcumin reduced TGF-β receptor type I (TβR-I) and TGF-β receptor type II (TβR II), but had no effect on phosphorylation of Smad2 and Smad3. On the other hand, in non-Smad pathway curcumin reduced TGF-β1-induced ERK phosphorylation and PPARγ phosphorylation, and promoted nuclear translocation of PPARγ. Further, the effect of curcumin on α-SMA, PAI-1, E-cadherin, TβR I and TβR II were reversed by ERK inhibitor U0126 or PPARγ inhibitor BADGE, or PPARγ shRNA. Blocking PPARγ signaling pathway by inhibitor BADGE or shRNA had no effect on the phosphorylation of ERK whereas the suppression of ERK signaling pathway inhibited the phosphorylation of PPARγ. We conclude that curcumin counteracted TGF-β1-induced EMT in renal tubular epithelial cells via ERK-dependent and then PPARγ-dependent pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2121300010,"Ubiquitylation of Nrf2 by the Keap1-Cullin3/RING box1 (Cul3-Rbx1) E3 ubiquitin ligase complex targets Nrf2 for proteasomal degradation in the cytoplasm and is an extensively studied mechanism for regulating the cellular level of Nrf2. Although mechanistic details are lacking, reports abound that Nrf2 can also be degraded in the nucleus. Here, we demonstrate that Nrf2 is a target for sumoylation by both SUMO-1 and SUMO-2. HepG2 cells treated with As2O3, which enhances attachment of SUMO-2/3 to target proteins, increased SUMO-2/3-modification (polysumoylation) of Nrf2. We show that Nrf2 traffics, in part, to promyelocytic leukemia-nuclear bodies (PML-NBs). Cell fractions harboring key components of PML-NBs did not contain biologically active Keap1 but contained modified Nrf2 as well as RING finger protein 4 (RNF4), a poly-SUMO-specific E3 ubiquitin ligase. Overexpression of wild-type RNF4, but not the catalytically inactive mutant, decreased the steady-state levels of Nrf2, measured in the PML-NB-enriched cell fraction. The proteasome inhibitor MG-132 interfered with this decrease, resulting in elevated levels of polysumoylated Nrf2 that was also ubiquitylated. Wild-type RNF4 accelerated the half-life (t½) of Nrf2, measured in PML-NB-enriched cell fractions. These results suggest that RNF4 mediates polyubiquitylation of polysumoylated Nrf2, leading to its subsequent degradation in PML-NBs. Overall, this work identifies Nrf2 as a target for sumoylation and provides a novel mechanism for its degradation in the nucleus, independent of Keap1.

They posited that the Keap1-dependent modality occurs only under homeostatic conditions, involves the cytoskeleton, and is directed by the DIDLID sequence (amino acid residues 17–32) within the Neh2 domain of Nrf2. The second modality was postulated to also occur in the cytoplasm and also to be directed by the DIDLID sequence, but away from the cytoskeleton, and in a Keap1-independent manner. The third modality was described as Keap1-independent, Neh6-mediated and to occur in the nucleus. Recently, the Neh6 domain was shown to contain two phosphodegrons that mediate degradation of Nrf2 by the E3 ubiquitin ligase β-TrCP in a Keap1-independent manner (15Rada P. Rojo A.I. Chowdhry S.

The authors remarked that there might also be other potential proteasome degradation motifs apart from those involving Keap1 and β-TrCP. Here, we demonstrate that Nrf2 is a target for sumoylation (post-translational modification by small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) proteins (17Rodriguez M.S. Dargemont C. Hay R.T.

We show that RNF4, a poly-SUMO-specific E3 ubiquitin ligase ubiquitylates polysumoylated Nrf2, leading to degradation of the modified Nrf2 in PML-NB domains. This work provides a novel mechanism for the degradation of Nrf2 in the nucleus. Construction of the expression plasmid for the fusion protein GFP-Nrf2 has been described previously (19Theodore M. Kawai Y. Yang J. Kleshchenko Y. Reddy S.P. Villalta F. Arinze I.J. Multiple nuclear localization signals function in the nuclear import of the transcription factor Nrf2.J. Biol.

Yeh (University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX) provided us with an expression plasmid for wild-type SENP1. Expression plasmid for FLAG-SENP1 mutant was purchased from Addgene (Cambridge, MA; catalog no. 17358). Expression plasmids for wild-type RNF4 (pBOS-RNF4wt-YFP) and mutant RNF4 (pBOS-RNF4-CSI-YFP), respectively, were obtained from Dr. Ronald T. Hay (University of Dundee, Dundee, Scotland, UK). The vector pBOS-H2BGFP was purchased from BD Biosciences. Expression plasmid for PML-I (pEGFP-C3-PML-I) was obtained from Dr. Peter Hemmerich (Leibniz Institute for Age Research, Fritz Lipman Institute, Jena, Germany). Plasmid pCMV6-RNF4-myc-DDK expressing RNF4 and the empty vector pCMV6-myc-DDK were obtained from OriGene Technologies. Expression plasmids for RFP-SUMO-1 and -2 and mutants thereof were obtained from Dr. Angela Chen (National Sun Yat-Sen University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan). HepG2 cells, obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA), were cultured in minimum essential medium (MEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 1× MEM nonessential amino acids (Invitrogen), and antibiotics (100 units of penicillin and 100 μg of streptomycin per ml) at 37 °C in 95% air, 5% CO2 atmosphere. HepG2 cells (∼5 × 105 cells per well) were seeded onto poly-d-lysine-coated coverslips in 6-well plates in 2 ml of medium and incubated overnight at 37 °C. The cells were then transfected with expression plasmid(s) indicated in the appropriate figures, using GeneJammer transfection reagent (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) at a 4:1 ratio of GeneJammer (μl) to DNA (μg). Twenty four hours after transfection, some cells were incubated with 10 μm MG-132 for 4 h, then harvested by removing the medium, and rinsing once with 1 ml of 1× phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). The cells were fixed with 500 μl of 3.7% formaldehyde solution for 10 min at room temperature, then washed twice with 1 ml of 1× PBS followed by a 5-min wash with 1 ml of 0.1 m glycine-Tris buffer (pH 7.4), and rinsed with 1 ml of 1× PBS. After fixation, the coverslips were mounted onto glass slides using a drop of Prolong Gold Antifade with DAPI (Invitrogen), dried, and kept overnight at 4 °C. Imaging was performed on a Nikon A1R confocal laser scanning microscope at excitation/emission wavelengths of 488/505–550 nm (for green fluorescence), 561/570–620 nm (red fluorescence), 640/662–737 nm (for PML, colored blue), and 405/425–475 nm (for DAPI, colored purple). When necessary, images of the fluorescence patterns were merged to visualize co-localization. HepG2 cells were grown and processed as for fluorescence imaging. After the fixation step, the cells were rinsed with PBS, followed by incubation in blocking solution (1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in PBS containing 1% Triton X-100) for 30 min at room temperature. After removing the blocking solution, the cells were incubated with anti-PML antibody (sc-966, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) diluted 1:50 in blocking solution for 1 h at room temperature. The primary antibody was removed by aspiration, and the coverslips were washed three times with PBS (5 min for each wash). Coverslips were then incubated with Alexa Fluor633 goat anti-mouse IgG (Invitrogen) diluted 1:2,500 in blocking solution for 1 h at room temperature in the dark and then washed and stained for nuclei as described above. The cells were then mounted in Aqua-Poly/Mount and dried overnight at 4 °C for visualization. PML protein was visualized at excitation/emission wavelengths of 633/650 nm LP filter, respectively, on a Nikon TE2000-U CI confocal microscope or a Nikon A1R confocal laser scanning microscope at excitation/emission wavelengths of 640/662–737 nm, respectively. Cells prepared for cellular localization by fluorescence microscopy as described above were used for FRET analysis, using the acceptor photobleaching method. Individual dots containing PML, GFP-Nrf2, and RFP-SUMO were analyzed. Donor (GFP) and acceptor (RFP) images were acquired with a Nikon A1R laser scanning confocal microscope. Images were deliberately underexposed to avoid saturation of the donor-dequenched GFP signal. For each dot analyzed, three consecutive images were captured (with no delay between captures) for both pre- and post-bleach conditions, and fluorescence intensity for each condition was averaged. In some cases, only values for the last pre-bleach and first post-bleach intensities were used in the calculations for FRET efficiencies. This was deemed necessary to correct for general photobleaching when overall signal loss masked a clear increase in initial post-bleach intensity. The average pre- and post-bleach fluorescence intensities were then used for calculating FRET efficiency for the various treatment conditions studied. For each treatment, 10–20 cells were imaged. FRET efficiency was expressed as the percent increase of pre-bleach GFP fluorescence in the region of interest compared with that observed after RFP photobleaching, according to the following equation: FRET efficiency (%) = ((GFPafter − GFPbefore)/GFPafter) × 100 (20Stanĕk D. Neugebauer K.M. Detection of snRNP assembly intermediates in Cajal bodies by fluorescence resonance energy transfer.J. Cell Biol. 2004; 166: 1015-1025Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Whole cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with appropriate antibody, according to the experiment, using PureProteome Protein G magnetic beads (Millipore, Temecula, CA) or Dynabeads (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Immunoprecipitated proteins were eluted in 30 μl of 2× Laemmli's sample buffer. The beads were collected using a magnetic rack, and the supernatant solution was resolved on 7% SDS-PAGE. Proteins were then analyzed by Western blotting using appropriate antibody as indicated in the legends to the various figures. HepG2 cells were grown to 80% confluence in T-75 flasks and then treated with either MG-132 (10 μm) for 4 h or As2O3 (2 μm) for up to 18 h. The cells were washed with 1× PBS and then scraped into ice-cold Triton X-100 lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mm EDTA, 1.0% Triton X-100, 1 mm PMSF, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 10 μl/ml protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma)) and kept on ice for 45 min, with occasional mixing, followed by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The pellet (the detergent-insoluble fraction) was resuspended in 100 μl of buffer containing equal volumes of 62.5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8) and 2× SDS sample buffer, then sonicated on ice, and boiled for 5 min. After quantification using a modified Bradford protein assay, the detergent-soluble and -insoluble fractions were used for Western blotting assays. Using glutathione-agarose resin, GST-Nrf2 was purified as described by Rachakonda et al. (21Rachakonda G. Xiong Y. Sekhar K.R. Stamer S.L. Liebler D.C. Freeman M.L.

The GST-Nrf2 fusion protein was then used as substrate in in vitro SUMO-1 and SUMO-2 conjugation assays, performed by using in vitro SUMOylation kits purchased from Active Motif (Carlsbad, CA), with p53 as a positive control. Nrf2-dependent gene transcription was assessed by reporter gene assay using ARE-driven minimal promoter HO-1-ARE-luc as described previously (19Theodore M. Kawai Y. Yang J. Kleshchenko Y. Reddy S.P.

Under confocal microscopy (Fig. 1, column 2), we observed aggregates or dots in nuclei of HepG2 cells incubated with the proteasome inhibitor MG-132. The dots were observed in at least 90% of such cells. Because the nucleus of the eukaryotic cell contains a variety of nuclear bodies exhibiting different subnuclear locations and various functions (25Spector D.L.

If these nuclear structures contained PML-NBs, we expected their presence to be disrupted by de-sumoylation, given that sumoylation is important in the formation of PML-NBs (30Ishov A.M.

Indeed, when pEGFP-Nrf2 was transfected into HepG2 cells along with expression plasmid for the SUMO-specific protease SENP1 (sentrin protease 1), the GFP fluorescence intensity of the nuclear dots was substantially diminished (Fig. 1, column 3). In contrast, mutant SENP1 that is catalytically inactive, and therefore cannot catalyze de-sumoylation, failed to abolish the nuclear dots (Fig. 1, column 4), suggesting that sumoylation was involved in the formation of these nuclear dots/aggregates. The data are quantified in the histogram. Western blotting (Fig. 1) showed that the expressed levels of SENP1 were higher in cells transfected with wild-type SENP1 (lane 3) or mutant SENP1 (lane 4) than in cells displaying endogenous levels of SENP1 (lanes 1 and 2). PML-NBs are nuclear domains that are initiated by sumoylated PML. The sumoylated PML then interacts noncovalently with other proteins containing SUMO interaction motifs (30Ishov A.M. Sotnikov A.G.

The aim was to identify the determinants of nutritional status in people with Parkinson's disease (PWP). Methods Community-dwelling PWP (>18 years) were recruited (n = 125; 73M/52F; Mdn 70 years). Self-report assessments included Beck's Depression Inventory (BDI), Spielberger Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), Scales for Outcomes in Parkinson's disease – Autonomic (SCOPA-AUT), Modified Constipation Assessment Scale (MCAS) and Freezing of Gait Questionnaire (FOG-Q). Information about age, PD duration, medications, co-morbid conditions and living situation was obtained. Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination (ACE-R), Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) II and UPDRS III were performed. Nutritional status was assessed using the Subjective Global Assessment (SGA) as part of the scored Patient-Generated Subjective Global Assessment (PG-SGA). Results Nineteen (15%) were malnourished (SGA-B). Median PG-SGA score was 3. More of the malnourished were elderly (84% vs. 71%) and had more severe disease (H&Y: 21% vs. 5%). UPDRS II and UPDRS III scores and levodopa equivalent daily dose (LEDD)/body weight(mg/kg) were significantly higher in the malnourished (Mdn 18 vs. 15; 20 vs. 15; 10.1 vs. 7.6 respectively). Regression analyses revealed older age at diagnosis, higher LEDD/body weight (mg/kg), greater UPDRS III score, lower STAI score and higher BDI score as significant predictors of malnutrition (SGA-B). Living alone and higher BDI and UPDRS III scores were significant predictors of a higher log-adjusted PG-SGA score. Conclusions In this sample of PWP, the rate of malnutrition was higher than that previously reported in the general community. Nutrition screening should occur regularly in those with more severe disease and depression. Community support should be provided to PWP living alone. Dopaminergic medication should be reviewed with body weight changes."
https://openalex.org/W1987639525,"Background Neonatal mortality currently accounts for 41% of all global deaths among children below five years. Despite recording a 33% decline in neonatal deaths between 2000 and 2009, about 900,000 neonates died in India in 2009. The decline in neonatal mortality is slower than in the post-neonatal period, and neonatal mortality rates have increased as a proportion of under-five mortality rates. Neonatal mortality rates are higher among rural dwellers of India, who make up at least two-thirds of India's population. Identifying the factors influencing neonatal mortality will significantly improve child survival outcomes in India. Methods Our analysis is based on household data from the nationally representative 2008 Indian District Level Household Survey (DLHS-3). We use probit regression techniques to analyse the links between neonatal mortality at the household level and households' access to health facilities. The probability of the child dying in the first month of birth is our dependent variable. Results We found that 80% of neonatal deaths occurred within the first week of birth, and that the probability of neonatal mortality is significantly lower when the child's village is closer to the district hospital (DH), suggesting the critical importance of specialist hospital care in the prevention of newborn deaths. Neonatal deaths were lower in regions where emergency obstetric care was available at the District Hospitals. We also found that parental schooling and household wealth status improved neonatal survival outcomes. Conclusions Addressing the main causes of neonatal deaths in India – preterm deliveries, asphyxia, and sepsis – requires adequacy of specialised workforce and facilities for delivery and neonatal intensive care and easy access by mothers and neonates. The slow decline in neonatal death rates reflects a limited attention to factors which contribute to neonatal deaths. The suboptimal quality and coverage of Emergency Obstetric Care facilities in India require urgent attention."
https://openalex.org/W2036347842,"Wound healing is a complex biological process involving the interaction of many cell types to replace lost or damaged tissue. Although the biology of wound healing has been extensively investigated, few studies have focused on the role of mast cells. In this study, we investigated the possible role of mast cells in wound healing by analyzing aspects of cutaneous excisional wound healing in three types of genetically mast cell-deficient mice. We found that C57BL/6-Kit(W-sh/W-sh), WBB6F1-Kit(W/W-v), and Cpa3-Cre; Mcl-1(fl/fl) mice re-epithelialized splinted excisional skin wounds at rates very similar to those in the corresponding wild type or control mice. Furthermore, at the time of closure, scars were similar in the genetically mast cell-deficient mice and the corresponding wild type or control mice in both quantity of collagen deposition and maturity of collagen fibers, as evaluated by Masson's Trichrome and Picro-Sirius red staining. These data indicate that mast cells do not play a significant non-redundant role in these features of the healing of splinted full thickness excisional cutaneous wounds in mice."
https://openalex.org/W2137310532,"Multiple myeloma (MM) is an incurable bone marrow malignancy of the B cell lineage. Utilizing multiplex Luminex technology we measured levels of 25 cytokines in the plasma of normal donors (n = 177), those with monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (n = 8), and MM patients (n = 55) with either active disease, on treatment, or in remission. The cytokine levels were compared between normal donors and MM patients as well as between various phases of MM, and discriminant analysis was used to create a predictive classification model based on the differentially expressed cytokines. Evaluating age- and gender-dependence of cytokine expression, we determined that with age there is a shift toward a pro-inflammatory environment. Moreover, we observed a strong gender bias in cytokine expression. However, the profile of differentially expressed cytokines was heavily skewed toward an anti-inflammatory, pro-tumorigenic response in patients with MM. Significantly, our predictive model placed all patients in remission in the same category as those with active disease. Thus, our study demonstrates that the homeostasis of systemic cytokines is not restored when MM patients enter remission, suggesting that once an individual has cancer, the microenvironment is permanently altered and the system is primed for a relapse."
https://openalex.org/W2026602510,"The extent of calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) inactivation in the brain after ischemia correlates with the extent of damage. We have previously shown that a loss of CaMKII activity in neurons is detrimental to neuronal viability by inducing excitotoxic glutamate release. In the current study we extend these findings to show that the ability of astrocytes to buffer extracellular glutamate is reduced when CaMKII is inhibited. Furthermore, CaMKII inhibition in astrocytes is associated with the rapid onset of intracellular calcium oscillations. Surprisingly, this rapid calcium influx is blocked by the N-type calcium channel antagonist, ω-conotoxin. Although the function of N-type calcium channels within astrocytes is controversial, these voltage-gated calcium channels have been linked to calcium-dependent vesicular gliotransmitter release. When extracellular glutamate and ATP levels are measured after CaMKII inhibition within our enriched astrocyte cultures, no alterations in glutamate levels are observed, whereas ATP levels in the extracellular environment significantly increase. Extracellular ATP accumulation associated with CaMKII inhibition contributes both to calcium oscillations within astrocytes and ultimately cortical neuron toxicity. Thus, a loss of CaMKII signaling within astrocytes dysregulates glutamate uptake and supports ATP release, two processes that would compromise neuronal survival after ischemic/excitotoxic insults."

The aim of the study was to examine the association between genetic variants in genes encoding proteins involved in immune response and the age at diagnosis of GD. Methods 735 GD patients and 1216 healthy controls from Poland were included into the study. Eight genetic variants in the HLA-DRB1, TNF, CTLA4, CD40, NFKb, PTPN22, IL4 and IL10 genes were genotyped. Patients were stratified by the age at diagnosis of GD and the association with genotype was analysed. Results Polymorphism in the HLA-DRB1, TNF and CTLA4 genes were associated with GD. The carriers of the HLA DRB1*03 allele were more frequent in patients with age at GD diagnosis ≤30 years than in patients with older age at GD diagnosis. Conclusions HLADRB1*03 allele is associated with young age at diagnosis of Graves' disease in polish population."
https://openalex.org/W2137401479,"The NF-κB transcription factor mediates the inflammatory response through distinct (canonical and non-canonical) signaling pathways. The mechanisms controlling utilization of either of these pathways are largely unknown. Here we observe that TNF stimulation induces delayed NF-κB2/p100 processing and investigate the coupling mechanism. TNF stimulation induces TNF-associated factor-1 (TRAF-1) that directly binds NF-κB-inducing kinase (NIK) and stabilizes it from degradation by disrupting its interaction with TRAF2·cIAP2 ubiquitin ligase complex. We show that TRAF1 depletion prevents TNF-induced NIK stabilization and reduces p52 production. To further examine the interactions of TRAF1 and NIK with NF-κB2/p100 processing, we mathematically modeled TRAF1·NIK as a coupling signaling complex and validated computational inference by siRNA knockdown to show non-canonical pathway activation is dependent not only on TRAF1 induction but also NIK stabilization by forming TRAF1·NIK complex. Thus, these integrated computational-experimental studies of TNF-induced TRAF1 expression identified TRAF1·NIK as a central complex linking canonical and non-canonical pathways by disrupting the TRAF2-cIAP2 ubiquitin ligase complex. This feed-forward kinase pathway is essential for the activation of non-canonical pathway."
https://openalex.org/W1964520872,"Dysregulation of cell proliferation and the cell cycle are associated with various diseases, such as cancer. Cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) play central roles in cell proliferation and the cell cycle. Ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase L1 (UCH-L1) is expressed in a restricted range of tissues, including the brain and numerous types of cancer. However, the molecular functions of UCH-L1 remain elusive. In this study, we found that UCH-L1 physically interacts with CDK1, CDK4, and CDK5, enhancing their kinase activity. Using several mutants of UCH-L1, we showed that this enhancement is dependent upon interaction levels between UCH-L1 and CDKs but is independent of the known ubiquitin-related functions of UCH-L1. Gain- and loss-of-function studies revealed that UCH-L1 enhances proliferation of multiple cell types, including human cancer cells. Inhibition of the interaction between UCH-L1 and cell cycle-associated CDK resulted in the abolishment of UCH-L1-induced enhancement of cell proliferation. RNA interference of UCH-L1 reduced the growth of human xenograft tumors in mice. We concluded that UCH-L1 is a novel regulator of the kinase activities of CDKs. We believe that our findings from this study will significantly contribute to our understanding of cell cycle-associated diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2024425462,"Background Sperm cryopreservation has become an indispensable tool in biology. Initially, studies were aimed towards the development of efficient freezing protocols in different species that would allow for an efficient storage of semen samples for long periods of time, ensuring its viability. Nowadays, it is widely known that an important individual component exists in the cryoresistance of semen, and efforts are aimed at identifying those sperm characteristics that may allow us to predict this cryoresistance. This knowledge would lead, ultimately, to the design of optimized freezing protocols for the sperm characteristics of each male. Methodology/Principal Findings We have evaluated the changes that occur in the sperm head dimensions throughout the cryopreservation process. We have found three different patterns of response, each of one related to a different sperm quality at thawing. We have been able to characterize males based on these patterns. For each male, its pattern remained constant among different ejaculates. This latter would imply that males always respond in the same way to freezing, giving even more importance to this sperm feature. Conclusions/Significance Changes in the sperm head during cryopreservation process have resulted useful to identify the ability of semen of males for freezing. We suggest that analyses of these response patterns would represent an important tool to characterize the cryoresistance of males when implemented within breeding programs. We also propose follow-up experiments to examine the outcomes of the use of different freezing protocols depending on the pattern of response of males."

Methods The population-based cross-sectional Beijing Eye Study 2011 included 3468 individuals with a mean age of 64.6±9.8 years (range: 50–93 years). A detailed ophthalmic examination was performed including spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT). Incomplete PVD was differentiated into type 1 (shallow PVD with circular perifoveal vitreous attachment), type 2 (PVD reaching fovea but not foveola), type 3 (shallow PVD with pinpoint vitreous attachment at the foveola), and type 4 (PVD completely detached from the macula, attached to the optic disc). Results An incomplete PVD was detected in 3948 eyes (prevalence: 60.5±0.6%; 95% Confidence Interval (CI): 59.3%,61.7%) of 2198 subjects (67.1±0.8%;95%CI: 65.6%,68.7%). Type 1 PVD was seen in 3090 (78.3%) eyes, type 2 PVD in 504 (12.8%) eyes, type 3 PVD in 70 (1.8%) eyes, and type 4 PVD in 284 (7.2%) eyes. Prevalence of incomplete PVD was associated with younger age (P<0.001;OR:0.91), male gender (P<0.001;OR:0.64), rural region of habitation (P<0.001;OR:0.49), larger corneal diameter (P = 0.04;OR:0.91), better best corrected visual acuity (P = 0.02;OR:0.41), and hyperopic refractive error (P<0.001;OR:1.15). The type of incomplete PVD was associated with higher age (P<0.001), urban region of habitation (P<0.001), myopic refractive error (P = 0.001), thinner cornea (P = 0.005), and better best corrected visual acuity (P = 0.056). Conclusions In adult Chinese in Greater Beijing, prevalence of an incomplete PVD (detected in 67.1% subjects) was associated with younger age, male gender, rural region of habitation, larger corneal diameter, better best corrected visual acuity and hyperopic refractive error."
https://openalex.org/W1994624897,"The effects of stress on emotional memory are distinct and depend on the stages of memory. Memory undergoes consolidation and reconsolidation after acquisition and retrieval, respectively. Stress facilitates the consolidation but disrupts the reconsolidation of emotional memory. Previous research on the effects of stress on memory have focused on long-term memory (LTM) formation (tested 24 h later), but the effects of stress on the persistence of LTM (tested at least 1 week later) are unclear. Recent findings indicated that the persistence of LTM requires late-phase protein synthesis in the dorsal hippocampus. The present study investigated the effect of stress (i.e., cold water stress) during the late phase after the acquisition and retrieval of contextual fear memory in rats. We found that stress and corticosterone administration during the late phase (12 h) after acquisition, referred to as late consolidation, selectively enhanced the persistence of LTM, whereas stress during the late phase (12 h) after retrieval, referred to as late reconsolidation, selectively disrupted the restabilized persistence of LTM. Moreover, the effects of stress on the persistence of LTM were blocked by the corticosterone synthesis inhibitor metyrapone, which was administered before stress, suggesting that the glucocorticoid system is involved in the effects of stress on the persistence of LTM. We conclude that stress within a restricted time window after acquisition or retrieval selectively affects the persistence of LTM and depends on the glucocorticoid system."

https://openalex.org/W2164485158,"Objectives The transcription factor SOX2 (3q26.3-q27) is an embryonic stem cell factor contributing to the induction of pluripotency in terminally differentiated somatic cells. Recently, amplification of the SOX2 gene locus has been described in squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of different organ sites. Aim of this study was to investigate amplification and expression status of SOX2 in sinonasal carcinomas and to correlate the results with clinico-pathological data. Materials and Methods A total of 119 primary tumor samples from the sinonasal region were assessed by fluorescence in-situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry for SOX2 gene amplification and protein expression, respectively. Of these, 59 were SSCs, 18 sinonasal undifferentiated carcinomas (SNUC), 10 carcinomas associated with an inverted papilloma (INVC), 19 adenocarcinomas (AD) and 13 adenoid cystic carcinomas (ACC). Results SOX2 amplifications were found in subsets of SCCs (37.5%), SNUCs (35.3%), INVCs (37.5%) and ADs (8.3%) but not in ACCs. SOX2 amplification resulted in increased protein expression. Patients with SOX2-amplified sinonasal carcinomas showed a significantly higher rate of tumor recurrences than SOX2 non-amplified tumors. Conclusion This is the first study assessing SOX2 amplification and expression in a large cohort of sinonasal carcinomas. As opposed to AD and ACC, SOX2 amplifications were detected in more than 1/3 of all SCCs, SNUCs and INVCs. We therefore suggest that SNUCs are molecularly closely related to SCCs and INVCs and that these entities represent a subgroup of sinonasal carcinomas relying on SOX2 acquisition during oncogenesis. SOX2 amplification appears to identify sinonasal carcinomas that are more likely to relapse after primary therapy, suggesting that these patients might benefit from a more aggressive therapy regime."
https://openalex.org/W2025633732,"This study systematically investigated the effect of chronic stress on the hippocampus and its damage mechanism at the whole genome level.The rat whole genome expression chips (Illumina) were used to detect gene expression differences in the hippocampus of rats subjected to chronic immobilization stress (daily immobilization stress for 3 h, for 7 or 21 days). The hippocampus gene expression profile was studied through gene ontology and signal pathway analyses using bioinformatics. A differentially expressed transcription regulation network was also established. Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used to verify the microarray results and determine expression of the Gabra1, Fadd, Crhr2, and Cdk6 genes in the hippocampal tissues.Compared to the control group, 602 differentially expressed genes were detected in the hippocampus of rats subjected to stress for 7 days, while 566 differentially expressed genes were expressed in the animals experiencing stress for 21 days. The stress significantly inhibited the primary immune system functions of the hippocampus in animals subjected to stress for both 7 and 21 days. Immobilization activated the extracellular matrix receptor interaction pathway after 7 day exposure to stress and the cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction pathway. The enhanced collagen synthesis capacity of the hippocampal tissue was the core molecular event of the stress regulation network in the 7-day group, while the inhibition of hippocampal cell growth was the core molecular event in the 21-day group. For the Gabra1, Fadd, Crhr2, and Cdk6 genes, RT-PCR results were nearly in line with gene chip assay results.During the 7-day and 21-day stress processes, the combined action of polygenic, multilevel, and multi-signal pathways leads to the disorder of the immunologic functions of the hippocampus, hippocampal apoptosis, and proliferation disequilibrium."
https://openalex.org/W2169293635,"Nascent high-density lipoprotein (HDL) particles arise in different sizes. We have sought to uncover factors that control this size heterogeneity. Gel filtration, native PAGE, and protein cross-linking were used to analyze the size heterogeneity of nascent HDL produced by BHK-ABCA1, RAW 264.7, J774, and HepG2 cells under different levels of two factors considered as a ratio, the availability of apolipoprotein AI (apoAI) -accessible cell lipid, and concentration of extracellular lipid-free apoAI. Increases in the available cell lipid:apoAI ratio due to either elevated ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) expression and activity or raised cell density (i.e., increasing numerator) shifted the production of nascent HDL from smaller particles with fewer apoAI molecules per particle and fewer molecules of choline-phospholipid and cholesterol per apoAI molecule to larger particles that contained more apoAI and more lipid per molecule of apoAI. A further shift to larger particles was observed in BHK-ABCA1 cells when the available cell lipid:apoAI ratio was raised still higher by decreasing the apoAI concentration (i.e., the denominator). These changes in nascent HDL biogenesis were reminiscent of the transition that occurs in the size composition of reconstituted HDL in response to an increasing initial lipid: apoAI molar ratio. Thus, the ratio of available cell lipid:apoAI is a fundamental cause of nascent HDL size heterogeneity, and rHDL formation is a good model of nascent HDL biogenesis.—Lyssenko, N.

AGEs are prevalent in the diabetic vasculature and contribute to the development of atherosclerosis. The presence and accumulation of AGEs in many different cell types affect the extracellular and intracellular structure and function. In the present study, we studied the immune response to the dehydroascorbic acid-derived AGEs and provide multiple lines of evidence suggesting that the AGEs could be an endogenous source of innate epitopes recognized by natural IgM antibodies. Prominent IgM titers to the AGEs were detected in the sera of normal mice and were significantly accelerated by the immunization with the AGEs. Patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), a potentially fatal systemic autoimmune disease characterized by the increased production of autoantibodies, showed significantly higher serum levels of the IgM titer against the AGEs than healthy individuals. A progressive increase in the IgM response against the AGEs was also observed in the SLE-prone mice. Strikingly, a subset of monoclonal antibodies, showing a specificity toward the AGEs, prepared from normal mice immunized with the AGEs and from the SLE mice cross-reacted with the double-stranded DNA. Moreover, they also cross-reacted with several other modified proteins, including the acetylated proteins, suggesting that the multiple specificity of the antibodies might be ascribed, at least in part, to the increased electronegative potential of the proteins. These findings suggest that the protein modification by the endogenous carbonyl compounds, generating electronegative proteins, could be a source of multispecific natural antibodies."
https://openalex.org/W1964557966,"Understanding the effects of climatic variability on marine mammals is challenging due to the complexity of ecological interactions. We used general linear models to analyze a 15-year database documenting marine mammal strandings (1994–2008; n = 1,193) and nine environmental parameters known to affect marine mammal survival, from regional (sea ice) to continental scales (North Atlantic Oscillation, NAO). Stranding events were more frequent during summer and fall than other seasons, and have increased since 1994. Poor ice conditions observed during the same period may have affected marine mammals either directly, by modulating the availability of habitat for feeding and breeding activities, or indirectly, through changes in water conditions and marine productivity (krill abundance). For most species (75%, n = 6 species), a low volume of ice was correlated with increasing frequency of stranding events (e.g. R2adj = 0.59, hooded seal, Cystophora cristata). This likely led to an increase in seal mortality during the breeding period, but also to increase habitat availability for seasonal migratory cetaceans using ice-free areas during winter. We also detected a high frequency of stranding events for mysticete species (minke whale, Balaenoptera acutorostrata) and resident species (beluga, Delphinapterus leucas), correlated with low krill abundance since 1994. Positive NAO indices were positively correlated with high frequencies of stranding events for resident and seasonal migratory cetaceans, as well as rare species (R2adj = 0.53, 0.81 and 0.34, respectively). This contrasts with seal mass stranding numbers, which were negatively correlated with a positive NAO index. In addition, an unusual multiple species mortality event (n = 114, 62% of total annual mortality) in 2008 was caused by a harmful algal bloom. Our findings provide an empirical baseline in understanding marine mammal survival when faced with climatic variability. This is a promising step in integrating stranding records to monitor the consequences of environmental changes in marine ecosystems over long time scales."

We provide here the first detailed insight into this hitherto uncharacterized regulatory interaction at residue-specific resolution using Escherichia coli Wzc, a canonical bacterial tyrosine kinase, and its opposing tyrosine phosphatase, Wzb. The phosphatase Wzb utilizes a surface distal to the catalytic elements of the kinase, Wzc, to dock onto its catalytic domain (WzcCD). WzcCD binds in a largely YC-independent fashion near the Wzb catalytic site, inducing allosteric changes therein. YC dephosphorylation is proximity-mediated and reliant on the elevated concentration of phosphorylated YC near the Wzb active site resulting from WzcCD docking. Wzb principally recognizes the phosphate of its phosphotyrosine substrate and further stabilizes the tyrosine moiety through ring stacking interactions with a conserved active site tyrosine."

We have previously implicated the E. coli monothiol glutaredoxin GrxD as playing an as yet undefined role in FeS cluster biosynthesis in E. coli due to the severe synthetic lethality of a grxD mutation in combination with mutations of the Isc system, the major FeS cluster biosynthesis apparatus of the cell (9Butland G.

The GrxD homodimer and GrxD-BolA heterodimer complexes are both capable of intact transfer of their FeS cluster to the model client protein apoferredoxin (Fdx) in vitro. Other in vitro work with Azotobacter vinelandii has shown that the A. vinelandii Grx5 monothiol glutaredoxin can accept an FeS cluster from IscU and that A. vinelandii Grx-nif can act to transfer an FeS cluster to the A-type carrier protein A. vinelandii NifIscA (13Mapolelo D.T.

However, the in vivo role for GrxD remains unknown, and the range of cellular processes impacted remains uncharacterized. One potential clue as to in vivo GrxD function in E. coli comes from protein-protein interaction data (14Butland G. Peregrín-Alvarez J.M. Li J. Yang W. Yang X. Canadien V. Starostine A. Richards D.

The adenosine modification, 2-methylthio-N6-isopentenyl adenosine (ms2i6A), is found at tRNA position 37 next to the anticodon. The first step of ms2i6A synthesis is catalyzed by MiaA and involves the addition of an isopentenyl group at the N6 nitrogen of adenosine 37 (A-37) to produce isopentenyl adenosine (i6A). The second step of the reaction is catalyzed by MiaB and consists of both sulfur insertion and methylation at position 2 of i6A (15Pierrel F. Björk G.R. Fontecave M. Atta M.

Chem. 2003; 278: 29515-29524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). MiaB has been proposed to utilize AdoMet to generate a tRNA substrate for sulfur insertion. Sulfur insertion would then proceed, utilizing the auxiliary “nonradical AdoMet” 4Fe4S cluster as a sulfur source (21Atta M. Arragain S. Fontecave M. Mulliez E. Hunt J.F. Luff J.D. Forouhar F.

Identification and function of auxiliary iron-sulfur clusters in radical SAM enzymes.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2012; 1824: 1196-1212Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). A second equivalent of AdoMet is then used to catalyze the methylation of the intermediate thio-N6-isopentenyl adenosine group (s2i6A). The proposed catalytic mechanism of MiaB entails self-sacrifice and the use of one of its own iron sulfur clusters as a substrate, suggesting that the enzyme requires constant FeS cluster regeneration or repair to perform multiple turnovers. Our goal is to validate and characterize the physical interactions and intact FeS cluster transfer properties of GrxD and NfuA with MiaB and determine how these factors influence the methylthiolation activity of MiaB in vivo. Plasmid vectors expressing N-terminal tagged E. coli His6-MiaB (pET6HMiaB), His6-NfuA (pET6HNfuA), His6-SufA (pET6HSufA), His6-ErpA (pET6HErpA), and His6-IscA (pET6HIscA) were created by independently amplifying the miaB, nfuA, sufA, erpA, and iscA genes from E. coli BW25113 genomic DNA by PCR and subsequent cloning of the PCR product into a pET28(b) vector (Novagen) using NdeI and HindIII restriction sites incorporated into the oligonucleotide primers. Plasmid constructs were freshly transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3) prior to use. Plasmid constructs to overproduce GrxD, BolA, and Fdx and their use were described previously (10Yeung N. Gold B. Liu N.L. Prathapam R. Sterling H.J. Willams E.R. Butland G. The E. coli monothiol glutaredoxin GrxD forms homodimeric and heterodimeric FeS cluster containing complexes.Biochemistry. 2011; 50: 8957-8969Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The MiaB C157A/C161A/C164A triple mutant was constructed by amplifying the 5′ part of the gene (nucleotides 1–490) with 5′-gggaatccatatgaccaaaaaactcc (introduction of a NdeI restriction site) and 5′-taggatcgtacgtggcatatttattggcgccttccatgatggagac (introduction of a BsiWI restriction site and the C157A and C161A mutations) (fragment 1) and the 3′ part of the gene with 5′-gtgaaacgtacgctgtggtgccttacacccgtg (introduction of a BsiWI restriction site and the C164A mutation) and 5′-ccgatcgaattcaccgac (contains a EcoRV restriction site) (fragment 2). The restriction sites are underlined. The PCR DNA fragment 1 was digested using NdeI and BsiWI, and the DNA fragment 2 was digested using BsiWI and EcoRV. The two digested pieces of DNA were ligated in a pET6HMiaB backbone digested by NdeI and EcoRV. The ligation product was transformed into DH5α cells, positive clones were verified by DNA sequencing, and constructs were designated pET6HMiaB3CA. All proteins were overproduced and purified to homogeneity exactly as described previously for GrxD (10Yeung N. Gold B. Liu N.L. Prathapam R. Sterling H.J. Willams E.R. Butland G.

His-tagged proteins were cleaved using the Novagen cleavage capture kit according to the specifications of the manufacturer. CD spectra (100 μm protein) were collected on a JASCO J-815 spectropolarimeter equipped with a Peltier temperature controller and stirring module. Apoprotein spectra were collected aerobically. Reconstituted proteins were prepared in an anaerobic chamber and analyzed in sealed cuvettes. CD spectra were recorded with stirring under the following conditions: temperature = 25 °C; digital integration time = 2 s; bandwidth = 1 nm; accumulations = 3; data pitch = 0.1 nm; and scan speed = 50 nm/min. The tRNA extraction protocol was adapted from a previously described procedure (19Pierrel F. Douki T. Fontecave M. Atta M.

Chem. 2004; 279: 47555-47563Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. E. coli strains to be analyzed were grown for 24 h at 37 °C in 1 liter of LB medium containing the appropriate antibiotic. The cells were then centrifuged and resuspended in 20 ml of 0.3 m sodium acetate, pH 4.5, 10 mm EDTA, flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C until use. Cells were lysed, and RNA was separated from cell debris and proteins using phenol saturated with 300 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.5, 10 mm EDTA. After purification on a NucleoBond AX 2000 column and a washing step, the pellet containing tRNAs was resuspended in water, snap-frozen, and stored at −80 °C. tRNAs (300 μg) were digested for 16 h at 37 °C in 20 mm ammonium acetate, pH 5.1, in the presence of 30 units of nuclease P1 (Sigma) and 0.5 mm ZnSO4. Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, was added to reach a concentration of 50 mm with 15 units of alkaline phosphatase (Sigma) and incubated for 4 h at 37 °C. Methanol was added to reach a concentration of 50% (V/V), and the solution was applied to a 3K Centricon (Millipore). The pass-through containing the digested nucleosides was saved, lyophilized, and resuspended in 50% MeOH. The solvents and chemicals used for these analyses were of HPLC grade (Honeywell Burdick & Jackson). Liquid chromatographic separation of nucleosides was conducted at 50 °C with a Kinetex XB-C18 reversed phase column (100-mm length, 3-mm internal diameter, 2.6-μm particle size; Phenomenex) using a 1200 series ZORBAX rapid resolution high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) system (Agilent Technologies). The injection volume for each measurement was 8 μl. The mobile phase was composed of 10 mm ammonium acetate (Sigma-Aldrich) in water (solvent A) and 10 mm ammonium acetate in 90% acetonitrile and 10% water (solvent B). The mobile phases were made up from a stock solution of 100 mm ammonium acetate and 0.7% formic acid (Sigma-Aldrich) in water. Nucleosides were separated with the following gradient: 20–100% B for 5 min, held at 100% B for 1 min, 100–20% B for 0.5 min, held at 20% B for 4 min. A flow rate of 0.4 ml/min was used throughout. Nucleosides were observed via diode array detection at a UV absorbance wavelength of 260 nm. The HPLC system was coupled to an Agilent Technologies 6210 TOF MS. Drying and nebulizing gases (i.e. nitrogen) were set to 12 liters/min and 25 pounds/in2, respectively, and a drying gas temperature of 320 °C was used throughout. ESI was conducted in the positive ion mode. ESI-MS experiments were carried out with a capillary voltage of 3.5 kV at 0.86 spectra/s for the detection of [M + H]+ ions. Data acquisition and processing were performed by the Agilent MassHunter software package. Surface plasmon resonance experiments were performed on a Biacore T100 (GE Healthcare). The His tag-free protein of interest was covalently immobilized to the carboxymethylated dextran matrix on a CM5 sensor chip (GE Healthcare) via primary amino groups using the amine-coupling protocol (GE Healthcare). Purified and tag-free GrxD, NfuA, MiaB, BolA, SufA, ErpA, and IscA were injected at various concentrations. All experiments were performed at a flow rate of 20 μl/min in 100 mm Tris, pH 8, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), 0.05% Tween 20. Binding of analyte to MiaB at equilibrium was plotted against analyte concentration, and the Biacore T100 evaluation software (Biacore) program was used to create a nonlinear curve fit of the data. Analytical gel filtration was performed on a Superdex 75 PC 3.2/30 column connected to an Ettan LC system (GE Healthcare). The column was equilibrated with gel filtration buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm KCl, 2 mm DTT, 1.5 mm glutathione) unless otherwise specified. Air-sensitive samples were taken out of an anaerobic chamber (Coy Laboratory Products) in gastight syringes and loaded immediately onto the column. Calibration was performed with the low molecular weight gel filtration calibration kit (GE Healthcare). Apo-MiaB (150 μm) was incubated in an anaerobic chamber at 25 °C with 0.014 eq of IscS and 5 mm l-cysteine in reconstitution buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm DTT). All components were degassed before introduction into an anaerobic chamber. Reconstitution reactions were set up to include all components except iron and incubated with constant stirring for 20 min. Reconstitution was initiated by the slow addition of 20 eq of ammonium iron (III) sulfate (Sigma-Aldrich). The protein mixture was allowed to mix for a further 2 h before application onto a Q-Sepharose column equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8. The column was rinsed with 5 column volumes of Tris-HCl, pH 8, and the protein was eluted using 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 500 mm NaCl. Apo-GrxD or His-tagged apo-GrxD was reconstituted exactly as described previously (10Yeung N. Gold B. Liu N.L. Prathapam R. Sterling H.J. Willams E.R. Butland G. The E. coli monothiol glutaredoxin GrxD forms homodimeric and heterodimeric FeS cluster containing complexes.Biochemistry. 2011; 50: 8957-8969Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Apo-NfuA (100 μm) was incubated in an anaerobic chamber at 25 °C with 0.05 eq of IscS and 2 mm l-cysteine in reconstitution buffer. After incubation for 20 min with constant stirring, 2 mm ammonium iron (III) sulfate was slowly added. The protein mixture was allowed to mix for a further 1 h before application onto a Q-Sepharose column equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8. The column was rinsed with 5 column volumes of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, and the protein was eluted using 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 500 mm NaCl. Apo-MiaB (100 μm) was incubated for 1 h in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm DTT with the His-tagged bait protein. Samples were then applied to a 1-ml HisTrap affinity column (GE Healthcare) and washed five times with 1 ml of buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm DTT, and 40 mm imidazole to remove unbound MiaB. Bound proteins were eluted in 0.5-ml fractions with buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm DTT, and 500 mm imidazole. Proteins present in each fraction were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. When GrxD was used as a bait, 2.5 mm glutathione was added to all the buffers listed above. Apo-MiaB (100 μm) was incubated with either reconstituted His-tagged holo-GrxD or reconstituted His-tagged holo-NfuA (200 μm) as described in the affinity co-purification assay and separated using a 1-ml HisTrap affinity column. Separation was performed as described in the affinity co-purification assay with the following modifications. Washes were made in a buffer containing 20 mm imidazole, and elution fractions were 1 ml. Proteins present in each fraction were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and by UV-visible spectrophotometry (Agilent HP 8453 spectrophotometer). When GrxD was used, 2.5 mm glutathione was added to all the buffers listed above. E. coli single gene deletion mutants were taken from the KEIO collection (23Baba T. Ara T. Hasegawa M. Takai Y. Okumura Y. Baba M. Datsenko K.A. Tomita M. Wanner B.L. Mori H. Construction of Escherichia coli K-12 in-frame, single-gene knockout mutants: the Keio collection.Mol. Syst.

The E. coli nfuA/grxD double mutant (SB5068) was constructed by mutagenesis of grxD in an nfuA background according to the procedure previously described (24Datsenko K.A. Wanner B.L.

Primer sequences used for mutagenesis are available on request. Biochemical and spectroscopic characterization of MiaB from Thermotoga maritima had shown that the protein binds two 4Fe4S clusters (25Hernández H.L. Pierrel F. Elleingand E. García-Serres R.

However, previous work indicated that MiaB from E. coli contained only a single FeS cluster (15Pierrel F. Björk G.R. Fontecave M. Atta M.

To address this discrepancy, we reconstituted the FeS cluster(s) in E. coli MiaB. After reconstitution, an A414/A280 ratio of 0.29 was obtained, which is very similar to that reported previously (25Hernández H.L. Pierrel F. Elleingand E. García-Serres R. Huynh B.H. Johnson M.K.

To confirm the presence of a second cluster in E. coli MiaB, we targeted three cysteine residues located at positions 157, 161, and 164, which are conserved in the radical AdoMet enzyme family (21Atta M. Arragain S. Fontecave M. Mulliez E. Hunt J.F. Luff J.D. Forouhar F. The methylthiolation reaction mediated by the radical-SAM enzymes.Biochim. Biophys.

Following reconstitution of the MiaB C157A/C161A/C164A mutant, the protein displayed an A414/A280 ratio of 0.151, consistent with only one 4Fe4S cluster being reconstituted (Fig. 1C). Taken together, these results indicate that MiaB from E. coli can also bind two 4Fe4S clusters. SPA purification data previously indicated that E. coli GrxD and BolA co-purify with each other, and FeS cluster-containing GrxD (± BolA) complexes were biochemically characterized (10Yeung N.

https://openalex.org/W1991350497,"Because classical music has greatly affected our life and culture in its long history, it has attracted extensive attention from researchers to understand laws behind it. Based on statistical physics, here we use a different method to investigate classical music, namely, by analyzing cumulative distribution functions (CDFs) and autocorrelation functions of pitch fluctuations in compositions. We analyze 1,876 compositions of five representative classical music composers across 164 years from Bach, to Mozart, to Beethoven, to Mendelsohn, and to Chopin. We report that the biggest pitch fluctuations of a composer gradually increase as time evolves from Bach time to Mendelsohn/Chopin time. In particular, for the compositions of a composer, the positive and negative tails of a CDF of pitch fluctuations are distributed not only in power laws (with the scale-free property), but also in symmetry (namely, the probability of a treble following a bass and that of a bass following a treble are basically the same for each composer). The power-law exponent decreases as time elapses. Further, we also calculate the autocorrelation function of the pitch fluctuation. The autocorrelation function shows a power-law distribution for each composer. Especially, the power-law exponents vary with the composers, indicating their different levels of long-range correlation of notes. This work not only suggests a way to understand and develop music from a viewpoint of statistical physics, but also enriches the realm of traditional statistical physics by analyzing music."

Our goal was to study the visual resolution and visual information gathering behavior (i.e., scanning) of brown-headed cowbirds.We measured the density of single cone photoreceptors, associated with chromatic vision, and double cone photoreceptors, associated with motion detection and achromatic vision. We also measured head movement rates, as indicators of visual information gathering behavior, when exposed to an object. We found that females had significantly lower density of single and double cones than males around the fovea and in the periphery of the retina. Additionally, females had significantly higher head-movement rates than males.Overall, we suggest that female cowbirds have lower chromatic and achromatic visual resolution than males (without sex differences in visual contrast perception). Females might compensate for the lower visual resolution by gazing alternatively with both foveae in quicker succession than males, increasing their head movement rates. However, other physiological factors may have influenced the behavioral differences observed. Our results bring up relevant questions about the sensory basis of sex differences in behavior. One possibility is that female and male cowbirds differentially allocate costly sensory resources, as a recent study found that females actually have greater auditory resolution than males."
https://openalex.org/W2126353681,"Acrolein, a mutagenic aldehyde, is produced endogenously by lipid peroxidation and exogenously by combustion of organic materials, including tobacco products. Acrolein reacts with DNA bases forming exocyclic DNA adducts, such as γ-hydroxy-1,N(2)-propano-2'-deoxyguanosine (γ-HOPdG) and γ-hydroxy-1,N(6)-propano-2'-deoxyadenosine (γ-HOPdA). The bulky γ-HOPdG adduct blocks DNA synthesis by replicative polymerases but can be bypassed by translesion synthesis polymerases in the nucleus. Although acrolein-induced adducts are likely to be formed and persist in mitochondrial DNA, animal cell mitochondria lack specialized translesion DNA synthesis polymerases to tolerate these lesions. Thus, it is important to understand how pol γ, the sole mitochondrial DNA polymerase in human cells, acts on acrolein-adducted DNA. To address this question, we investigated the ability of pol γ to bypass the minor groove γ-HOPdG and major groove γ-HOPdA adducts using single nucleotide incorporation and primer extension analyses. The efficiency of pol γ-catalyzed bypass of γ-HOPdG was low, and surprisingly, pol γ preferred to incorporate purine nucleotides opposite the adduct. Pol γ also exhibited ∼2-fold lower rates of excision of the misincorporated purine nucleotides opposite γ-HOPdG compared with the corresponding nucleotides opposite dG. Extension of primers from the termini opposite γ-HOPdG was accomplished only following error-prone purine nucleotide incorporation. However, pol γ preferentially incorporated dT opposite the γ-HOPdA adduct and efficiently extended primers from the correctly paired terminus, indicating that γ-HOPdA is probably nonmutagenic. In summary, our data suggest that acrolein-induced exocyclic DNA lesions can be bypassed by mitochondrial DNA polymerase but, in the case of the minor groove γ-HOPdG adduct, at the cost of unprecedented high mutation rates."
https://openalex.org/W2013589743,"Adolescence is associated with a dramatic increase in risky and impulsive behaviors that have been attributed to developmental differences in neural processing of rewards. In the present study, we sought to identify age differences in anticipation of absolute and relative rewards. To do so, we modified a commonly used monetary incentive delay (MID) task in order to examine brain activity to relative anticipated reward value (neural sensitivity to the value of a reward as a function of other available rewards). This design also made it possible to examine developmental differences in brain activation to absolute anticipated reward magnitude (the degree to which neural activity increases with increasing reward magnitude). While undergoing fMRI, 18 adolescents and 18 adult participants were presented with cues associated with different reward magnitudes. After the cue, participants responded to a target to win money on that trial. Presentation of cues was blocked such that two reward cues associated with $.20, $1.00, or $5.00 were in play on a given block. Thus, the relative value of the $1.00 reward varied depending on whether it was paired with a smaller or larger reward. Reflecting age differences in neural responses to relative anticipated reward (i.e., reference dependent processing), adults, but not adolescents, demonstrated greater activity to a $1 reward when it was the larger of the two available rewards. Adults also demonstrated a more linear increase in ventral striatal activity as a function of increasing absolute reward magnitude compared to adolescents. Additionally, reduced ventral striatal sensitivity to absolute anticipated reward (i.e., the difference in activity to medium versus small rewards) correlated with higher levels of trait Impulsivity. Thus, ventral striatal activity in anticipation of absolute and relative rewards develops with age. Absolute reward processing is also linked to individual differences in Impulsivity."
https://openalex.org/W2007608382,"Reading requires the interaction of a distributed set of cortical areas whose distinct patterns give rise to a wide range of individual skill. However, the nature of these neural interactions and their relation to reading performance are still poorly understood. Functional connectivity analyses of fMRI data can be used to characterize the nature of interactivity of distributed brain networks, yet most previous studies have focused on connectivity during task-free (i.e., ""resting state"") conditions. Here, we report new methods for assessing task-related functional connectivity using data-driven graph theoretical methods and describe how large-scale patterns of connectivity relate to individual variability in reading performance among children. We found that connectivity patterns of subjects performing a reading task could be decomposed hierarchically into multiple sub-networks, and we observed stronger long-range interaction between sub-networks in subjects with higher task accuracy. Additionally, we found a network of hub regions known to be critical to reading that displays increased short-range synchronization in higher accuracy subjects. These individual differences in task-related functional connectivity reveal that increased interaction between distant regions, coupled with selective local integration within key regions, is associated with better reading performance. Importantly, we show that task-related neuroimaging data contains far more information than usually extracted via standard univariate analyses--information that can meaningfully relate neural connectivity patterns to cognition and task."

In brief, the cells were grown in 4.8 liters (800 ml × six flasks) of Terrific Broth medium at 33 °C until A600 of ∼7 and then harvested at 5,800 × g for 20 min. The cells were resuspended at 10% (w/v) in a buffer containing 50 mm Bis-Tris (pH 6.0), 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), and 10% (w/v) glycerol. The cell suspensions were sonicated twice with a 1-s on/1-s off cycle for 60 s, passed once in a French press at 25,000 p.s.i., and centrifuged at 23,400 × g for 20 min. The supernatant was ultracentrifuged at 256,600 × g for 60 min. The pellet was resuspended in the buffer containing 50 mm Bis-Tris (pH 6.0 at 4 °C), 2 mm CaCl2, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 10% glycerol, and a protease inhibitor mixture (Complete EDTA-free tablets, Roche Diagnostics) (buffer A) was added. The resulting membrane suspension was frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C until use. All steps were carried out at 4 °C. The pellet (membrane fraction) was suspended at 5 mg of protein/ml in buffer A. After the addition of dodecyl-β-d-maltoside (DDM) at a final concentration of 1.2% (w/v), the sample was gently stirred for 30 min and centrifuged at 250,000 × g for 20 min. After this, 200 mm NaCl and 5 mm histidine (at the final concentrations) were added drop by drop to the supernatant. This was followed by the addition of Ni-NTA resins (Qiagen) equilibrated in 50 mm Bis-Tris, pH 6.0. The supernatant was incubated with gentle stirring for 1 h. Then, the sample was poured into an empty column. The gravity packed column was washed with 3–5 column volumes of buffer A containing 200 mm NaCl, 0.1% DDM, and 5–10 mm histidine, and the enzyme was eluted with buffer A containing 200 mm NaCl, 0.1% DDM, and 200 mm histidine. The brown-colored fractions were pooled and concentrated (Amicon-Ultra, molecular weight cut-off 100K; Millipore) to 2–8 mg of protein/ml. The concentrated complex I was immediately applied onto a desalting column (Econo-Pac 10DG, 10 ml; Bio-Rad), which had been equilibrated with buffer A containing 200 mm NaCl and 0.1% DDM, to remove histidine. The desalted enzyme fraction was quickly frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C until use. SDS-PAGE was performed according to Laemmli (39Laemmli U.K. Cleavage of structural proteins during the assembly of the head of bacteriophage T4.Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207012) Google Scholar) and Schägger (40Schägger H. Tricine-SDS-PAGE.Nat Protoc. 2006; 1: 16-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (1912) Google Scholar). The expression of the NuoE subunit was immunochemically determined using antibodies specific to NuoE. The assembly of E. coli complex I was evaluated by using Blue-Native PAGE according to Refs. 41Wittig I. Braun H.P. Schägger H. Blue native PAGE.Nat Protoc. 2006; 1: 418-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (1261) Google Scholar and 42Schägger H. von Jagow G.

(43Shinzawa-Itoh K. Seiyama J. Terada H. Nakatsubo R. Naoki K. Nakashima Y. Yoshikawa S. Bovine heart NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase contains one molecule of ubiquinone with ten isoprene units as one of the cofactors.Biochemistry. 2010; 49: 487-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) except that we used ∼1 mg of the complex I/extraction. We also isolated ubiquinone 8 (UQ8) and menaquinone 8 (MK8) from E. coli membranes grown aerobically and semi-anaerobically and used them as standards. The 20-μl portion of each sample was applied to an HPLC system (LC-20AB, Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) equipped with a C18 column (Inertsil ODS3, 5 μm, 4.6 × 250 mm; GL science, Torrance, CA) equilibrated with a mobile phase consisting of ethanol/methanol/acetonitrile (4:3:3 v/v/v) at a flow rate of 1 ml/min at 50 °C. The elution was monitored on a UV-visible detector (SPD-20AV, Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) at 260 and 320 nm, and the content of UQ8 was estimated from the peak area by comparison with authentic compounds of known concentrations based on the molecular extinction, 14.9 mm−1 cm−1 at 275 nm reported (44Crane F.L. Barr R. Determination of ubiquinones.Methods Enzymol. 1971; 18: 137-165Crossref Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The isolated complex I of 2 mg of protein was dissolved in 1 ml of 50 mm Bis-Tris buffer, pH 6.0, containing 0.1% DDM. The enzyme solution was treated with 5% trichloroacetic acid and homogenized with a Vortex mixer for 20 s and followed by heat treatment at 100 °C for 5 min. The denatured protein was removed by centrifugation. The FMN content was determined by the absorbance difference between 445 and 580 nm using the molecular extinction coefficient of FMN, Δϵ445–580 nm, of 11.1 mm−1 cm−1 in the presence of 5% trichloroacetic acid (43Shinzawa-Itoh K.

The NADH:K3Fe(CN)6, NADH:hexaamine ruthenium), and NADH:n-decylubiquinone activity was spectrophotometrically measured at 30 °C using a Cary 60 UV-visible spectrophotometer (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA). The buffers used were: (a) 50 mm MES buffer (pH 6.0) containing 50 mm NaCl, (b) 10 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) containing 1 mm EDTA, and (c) 25 mm HEPES-Bis-Tris propane (pH 7.5) containing 3 mm KCl. Reaction mixtures contained 150 μm NADH, 10 mm KCN, and 1 mm K3Fe(CN)6 and 350 μm hexaamine ruthenium or 25 μm n-decylubiquinone. Extinction coefficients of ϵ340 = 6.22 mm−1 cm−1 for NADH and ϵ420 = 1.00 mm−1 cm−1 for K3Fe(CN)6 were used for activity calculations. Reported values are the average of three measurements. EPR samples were prepared under strict anaerobic conditions. After the addition of 6 mm NADH or 10–20 mm neutralized sodium dithionite solution, each sample was incubated for 10 min, transferred to an EPR tube, and then frozen immediately. EPR spectra were recorded by a Bruker Elexsys E500 spectrometer at X-band (9.4 GHz) using an Oxford Instrument ESR900 helium flow cryostat. EPR spectra of the iron-sulfur clusters were simulated by SimFonia (Bruker). Power saturation data were analyzed by a computer fitting method as described previously (37Vinogradov A.D. Sled V.D.

Any variations from the procedures and other details are described in the figure legends. After the second round of PCR to extend three additional histidines in the N terminus of the NuoE subunit, we obtained the final plasmid containing (His)9-nuoE in addition to the originally designed (His)6-nuoE plasmid. The NuoE deletion strain was complemented by pKO3 plasmids containing either (His)6-nuoE or (His)9-nuoE, and we obtained both (His)6-nuoE and (His)9-nuoE mutant strains. Both mutant strains showed normal growth. Complex I activities in mem"
https://openalex.org/W2022038886,"Mollusk remains are abundant in archaeological sites in the Guanzhong Basin of Northwestern China, providing good opportunities for investigations into the use of mollusks by prehistoric humans. Here we report on freshwater gastropod and bivalve mollusks covering the time interval from about 5600 to 4500 cal. yrs BP from sites of Mid-Late Neolithic age. They are identified as Cipangopaludina chinensis and Unio douglasiae, both of which are currently food for humans. The shells are well preserved and have no signs of abrasion. They are all freshwater gastropods and bivalves found in pits without water-reworked deposits and have modern representatives which can be observed in rivers, reservoirs, and paddy fields in the studied region. Mollusk shells were frequently recovered in association with mammal bones, lithic artifacts, and pottery. These lines of evidence indicate that the mollusks are the remains of prehistoric meals. The mollusk shells were likely discarded into the pits by prehistoric humans after the flesh was eaten. However, these mollusk remains may not have been staple food since they are not found in large quantities. Mollusk shell tools and ornaments are also observed. Shell tools include shell knives, shell reaphooks and arrowheads, whereas shell ornaments are composed of pendants and loops. All the shell tools and ornaments are made of bivalve mollusks and do not occur in large numbers. The finding of these freshwater mollusk remains supports the view that the middle Holocene climate in the Guanzhong Basin may have been warm and moist, which was probably favorable to freshwater mollusks growing and developing in the region."
https://openalex.org/W1967001022,"We report data from an internet questionnaire of sixty number trivia. Participants were asked for the number of cups in their house, the number of cities they know and 58 other quantities. We compare the answers of familial sinistrals – individuals who are left-handed themselves or have a left-handed close blood-relative – with those of pure familial dextrals – right-handed individuals who reported only having right-handed close blood-relatives. We show that familial sinistrals use rounder numbers than pure familial dextrals in the survey responses. Round numbers in the decimal system are those that are multiples of powers of 10 or of half or a quarter of a power of 10. Roundness is a gradient concept, e.g. 100 is rounder than 50 or 200. We show that very round number like 100 and 1000 are used with 25% greater likelihood by familial sinistrals than by pure familial dextrals, while pure familial dextrals are more likely to use less round numbers such as 25, 60, and 200. We then use Sigurd’s (1988, Language in Society) index of the roundness of a number and report that familial sinistrals’ responses are significantly rounder on average than those of pure familial dextrals. To explain the difference, we propose that the cognitive effort of using exact numbers is greater for the familial sinistral group because their language and number systems tend to be more distributed over both hemispheres of the brain. Our data support the view that exact and approximate quantities are processed by two separate cognitive systems. Specifically, our behavioral data corroborates the view that the evolutionarily older, approximate number system is present in both hemispheres of the brain, while the exact number system tends to be localized in only one hemisphere."
