The substrate specificity of this enzyme has recently been reported2 to embrace oligosaccharides and dextrins containing as few as two 1→4 linked α-D-glucopyranoside units in the ‘A’ chain and two such units in the ‘B’ chain. Thus, a tetra-saccharide linked 2 on 2 is the smallest known substrate for the hydrolytic action of this enzyme2."

https://openalex.org/W1995721837,"IT has been demonstrated by Firemark, Barlow and Roth1 that the concentration of pralidoxime (PAM) in the rat brain cortex after a single intravenous injection of PAM-14C is significantly higher than in other brain regions. The present communication reports an attempt to see whether such a relatively small dose of PAM as used by these authors (20 mg/kg) is able to reactivate satisfactorily the phosphorylated cholinesterase in the brain cortex of rats poisoned with lethal doses of paraoxon."

https://openalex.org/W2061179165,"WHILE studying the distribution of acetylcholine and other esterases in the insect Rhodnius1, it was observed that every droplet of triglyceride in the cells of the fat body has a small disk-like area or ‘cap’, 1µ or less in diameter, which is the site of an enzyme that will hydrolyse 5-bromoindoxyl acetate (method of Holt2) and naphthol AS acetate (method of Pearse3). This esterase is not inhibited by eserine or other inhibitors of the cholinesterase group; it was believed to be a lipase and it was concluded that the active disk or cap constitutes an organelle responsible for the liberation and perhaps the uptake of fatty acids in the droplets of stored lipid1."

https://openalex.org/W1996562163,PHAGES capable of generalized transduction among strains of Proteus mirabilis have been described1–3. Proteus morganii differs in many respects from P. mirabilis4 including a growth requirement for pantothenate and l-cystine in addition to the nicotinic acid requirement of the latter organism5. Several gene loci of these two species are being investigated in this laboratory. With P. mirabilis biochemical work is complemented with genetic (transductional) studies. In order to do the same with P. morganii it was decided to search for transducing phages active on this species.

https://openalex.org/W2088418755,"Friedman and Friedman1 recently reported that chronic administration of a crude extract of the posterior pituitary gland extended the life-span of old male rats. They postulated that this effect resulted from changes caused by vasopressin in the metabolism of water and salts. Vasopressin alone, however, failed to produce prolongation of life in the aforementioned experiments. More recently, they have extended their investigations to the effect of aldosterone."

In the first of these systems investigated—the sydnones (I)—we found marked central nervous system stimulation1–6."

https://openalex.org/W2032782659,"IT has been reported1 that after adaptation of pointing behaviour in a prism-wearing situation, subjects will mis-locate the position of an auditory stimulus if blindfolded and asked to point directly at it. The direction of this error of location is identical to that which would be expected if the subject were asked to point at a visual target after adaptation."

https://openalex.org/W2033847862,"IT has previously been reported that female rats develop lipaemia and fatty livers during treatment with cortisone1, and, more recently, the pathogenesis of this has been traced to a markedly enhanced mobilization of fatty acids from adipose tissue2. The mechanism thus seems quite different from that accounting for the fat accumulation in the livers of female, but not of male, rats during ethionine administration3, and it is not reversed or prevented by measures which are effective during ethionine treatment2. Nevertheless, it is important to clarify whether the effect could also be observed in male rats."

In this way a ‘shadowgram’ of purine or pyrimidine ‘spots’ may be produced by exposing the covered film to an ultra-violet source, or of amino-acid spots (after development with ninhydrin) by exposure to visible light."
