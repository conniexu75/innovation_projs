https://openalex.org/W1539399265,"Vesicles isolated from cardiac muscle exhibited Na,Ca exchange activity which can be measured by 45Ca influx or efflux of by 22Na efflux. The stoichiometry of Na,Ca exchange was 3 Na:1 Ca. These vesicles also exhibited ATP-dependent 22Na transport which was inhibited by ouabain indicating that this activity is due to the sodium pump, an activity which is thought to reside only in the sarcolemma. The addition of calcium caused rapid efflux of 22Na from vesicles loaded by ATP-dependent 22Na uptake indicating that the Na,Ca exchange is located in the same vesicles as the sodium pump and is thus also a sarcolemmal activity."
https://openalex.org/W1522226780,"Abstract The virus-associated (VA) RNAI gene in human adenovirus 2 DNA has been shown by Wu (Wu, G. J. (1978) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 75, 2175--2179) to be transcribed by RNA polymerase III in a human KB cell-free extract. In the present report we have examined the fidelity of transcription of adenovirus 2 DNA and Xenopus oocyte 5 S DNA templates by RNA polymerase III in extracts derived from cultured human, murine, and amphibian kidney cells, Size and sequences analysis of the discrete transcripts synthesized in these homologous and heterologous systems indicate that they result from accurate transcription of the corresponding genes. The specific transcripts identified include both the adenovirus VA RNAI and VA RNAII, Xenopus 5 S RNA, and VA RNAI and 5 S RNA species with elongated 3' termini. The extracts derived from the various cell types differ in the ability to discriminate between the two VA RNA genes or between the heterogeneous 5 S RNA genes in the cloned DNA fragment. Wherease the human cell extracts transcribe the VA RNAI and VA RNAII genes of adenovirus at a relative frequency close to that observed in isolated nuclei, the amphibian cell extract appears to transcribe only the VA RNAI gene. The amphibian cell extract transcribes primarily that 5 S RNA gene (within 5 S DNA) which encodes the dominant oocyte 5 S RNA, whereas the human cell extract transcribes at least two distinct 5 S RNA genes. Additionally, it is shown that the VA RNAI and VA RNAII genes have separate promotor sites. The kinetics of the transcription reactions have been examined and conditions optimal for specific transcription have been established by examining the effects of salt, metal ion, and template concentrations on both total and specific RNA synthesis. It is also shown that components in the cell-free extract (from human cells) are active in directing the accurate transcription of adenovirus DNA by purified RNA polymerase III."
https://openalex.org/W1482044739,"Tunicamycin, an antibiotic that inhibits the transfer of N-acetyglucosamine-1-phosphate from UDP-N-acetylglucosamine to dolichol monophosphate and thereby blocks the formation of protein-carbohydrate linkages of the N-glycosidic type, is not a single compound but a mixture of homologous antibiotics. Two major and eight minor homologs have been identified, all of which possess the ability to inhibit protein glycosylation. The biological activities of the two major components of tunicamycin were investigated and found to differ in their ability to inhibit protein glycosylation and in their effectiveness to inhibit protein synthesis. When completely blocking mannose incorporation into protein, one homolog inhibited protein synthesis by 50% while the other had only a negligible effect. The results demonstrate that differences in biological activity can be discriminated among tunicamycin homologs."
https://openalex.org/W1566199310,"The sugar chains of bovine rhodopsin were released from the polypeptide moiety by hydrazinolysis and reduced with NaB[3H]4 after N-acetylation. The radioactive oligosaccharides thus obtained were fractionated into three components by paper chromatography. The structures of these components were elucidated as GlcNAc beta 1 leads to 2Man alpha 1 leads to 3 (Man alpha 1 leads to 6)Man beta 1 leads to 4GlcNAc beta 1 leads to 4GlcNAc, GlcNAc beta 1 leads to 2Man alpha 1 leads to 3(Man alpha 1 leads to 3 and 6 Man alpha 1 leads to 6)Man beta leads to 4GlcNAc beta 1 leads to 4GlcNAc, and GlcNAc beta 1 leads to 2Man alpha 1 leads to 3(Man alpha 1 leads to 3 (Man alpha 1 leads to 6)Man alpha 1 leads to 6)Man beta 1 leads to 4GlcNAc beta 1 leads to 4GlcNAc, by sequential exoglycosidase digestion, methylation analysis, and endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase D digestion. The unusual features of the sugar chains of rhodopsin molecule seem to support the proposed processing pathway for the biosynthesis of asparagine-linked sugar chains of glycoproteins."
https://openalex.org/W1511657974,"Embryos of the sea urchin, Stronglyocentrotus purpuratus, synthesize several classes of sulfated and non-sulfated glycoproteins during gastrulation. The antibiotic tunicamycin, which is a specific inhibitor of the N-glycosylation of proteins, inhibits the synthesis of lipid-linked oligosaccharides in these embryos at concentrations which have little effect on the biosynthesis of other classes of glycolipids or on protein synthesis. As a consequence of this inhibition, glycoproteins with oligosaccharide side chains of the general type (Man)5-7-(GlcNAc)2 are not synthesized. In addition, the biosynthesis of a novel class of sulfated glycoproteins is inhibited. In contrast, no effect upon the synthesis of sulfated glycosaminoglycans is seen. The morphogenetic consequence of tunicamycin treatment is that development of embryos from the mesenchyme blastula to the gastrula stage is arrested. The results provide evidence that during development glycoproteins containing both unsulfated and sulfated N-glycosidically linked oligosaccharide chains are synthesized via the lipid-linked pathway. The biosynthesis of these molecules appears to be a prerequisite to the differentiation and morphogenesis that occurs during gastrulation."
https://openalex.org/W1541256063,"Beef heart muscle has been found to contain an enzyme which will rapidly and directly reduce metmyoglobin in vitro. Reduction rates are far greater than any previously reported for nonspecific or nonenzymatic systems. The enzyme is NADH-dependent and requires the presence of ferrocyanide ion for in vitro assay. The artificial electron carriers, dichlorophenolindophenol and methylene blue, are not required. Nonenzymatic reduction of metmyoglobin, which has previously been reported, was not encountered under the assay conditions described herein. Demonstration of enzymatic activity is dependent on a suitable myoglobin substrate, NADH, and ferrocyanide. An equimolar amount of cytochrome b5 was more effective than ferrocyanide in the enzymatic reduction of metmyoglobin. The methods for preparation of beef heart myoglobin and for purification of the enzyme are presented. The enzyme has been purified over 2000-fold. The enzyme has a pH optimum about 6.5 and a Km of 5.0 x 10(-5) M, and is unaffected by the absence of O2. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel electrophoresis revealed a molecular weight around 30,000. Purified enzyme does not react with lipoamide. The reaction is markedly influenced by the composition of the buffering milieu. Enzyme activity is inhibited by p-chloromercuriphenyl sulfonic acid, quinacrine dihydrochloride, and N-ethyl-maleimide. Activity was slightly stimulated by FMN. The characteristics of the enzymatic activity and the assay system are similar to those reported by Hegesh et al. (J. Lab. Clin. Med. 72, 339-344, 1968) for erythrocyte methemoglobin reductase."
https://openalex.org/W1595350639,"Lactate utilization by skeletal muscle was studied in the perfused rat hindlimb. At lactate concentrations above 4 mu, the hindlimb consistently removed lactate from the perfusion medium. At the concentrations examined (up to 26 mu), the rate of lactate uptake was proportional to lactate concentration. When the hindlimb was perfused with medium containing 12 mu lactate as the only substrate, a rapid increase in glycogen occurred in the fast-twitch red and fast-twitch white types of muscle. In contrast, the rate of glycogen accumulation in the slow-twitch red type of muscle was so slow as to be of questionable physiological significance. [W]Lactate was rapidly incorporated into glycogen in the plantaris muscle which is composed predominantly (about 94%) of fast-twitch fibers, while there was little incorporation of [14C]lactate into glycogen in the soleus muscle which consists predominantly of slow-twitch red fibers. Measurement of fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase activity provided an explanation for the very slow rate of lactate conversion to glycogen in slow-twitch red muscle. It was found that in contrast to the fast-twitch red and white types of muscle, the slow-twitch red soleus muscle has an extremely low level of fructose1,6-bisphosphatase activity. There was a 24% inhibition of lactate uptake, and the amount of [14C]lactate incorporated into plantaris muscle glycogen was reduced by 30%, when 8.5 mu glucose and insulin were included in the perfusion medium. However, neither the rate of lactate uptake nor the rate of glycogen accumulation was affected by a high concentration of insulin alone."

https://openalex.org/W1566997114,"The size of androgen receptors from rat ventral and dorsal prostate, dorsal prostate (Dunning) tumor, testis, epididymis, and seminal vesicle was determined using Sephadex G-200 chromatogrpahy and sucrose gradient centrifugation. The protease inhibitor diisopropyl fluorophosphate (DFP) was used to minimize receptor breakdown. An 8-9 S, 85 to 106 A receptor (Mr = 280,000 to 365,000; f/fo = 1.9 to 2.4) observed in unfractionated cytosol prepared in low ionic strength buffer with or without DFP is in equilibrium with a 4.5-5 S, 58 A form (Mr = 117,000; f/fo = 1.8) observed at salt concentrations greater than 0.1 M KCl. Receptor partially purified using (NH4)2SO4 or phosphocellulose chromatography in the absence of DFP was present as smaller fragments of 3.6 S, 37 A and 3.0 S, 23 A. Similar fragments could be generated from the 4.5 S or 8 S receptor by mild trypsin treatment. In addition, ventral prostate contains a DFP-insensitive enzyme which specifically converts the 4.5 S, 58 A receptor to the 3.6 S 37 A fragment. The DFP-insensitive enzyme is partially inhibited by rabbit bile and appears similar to the enzyme seminin, a secretory protein of human prostate. Androgen receptor isolated in the presence of DFP from nuclei labeled in vivo is predominantly 4.5 S, 58 A, with smaller forms (37 and 23 A) appearing in the absence of DFP. The 4.5 S, 58 A nuclear receptors were also in equilibrium with a large 8 S form. Receptor breakdown by DFP-insensitive and sensitive proteases appears to be an in vitro phenomenon. Furthermore, the size of the androgen receptor is not significantly changed during receptor migration from cytoplasm to nucleus."
https://openalex.org/W1576559346,"Hamster cell fibronectin is a glycoprotein consisting of two 230,000-dalton subunits in a disulfide-bonded dimer. The molecule is composed of domains which can be separated by partial proteolytic cleavage. The carbohydrates, disulfide bonds, and a single free sulfhydryl group per chain are distributed nonuniformly among these regions. All the interchain disulfides are within 10,000 daltons of the end of the molecule and are removed by mild proteolysis which also generates 200,000- and 25,000-dalton fragments which do not contain interchain disulfides. The 200,000-dalton fragment contains all or most of the carbohydrate side chains, and the free sulfhydryl group, but is relatively poor in cystine. The 25,000-dalton fragment is carbohydrate-free and cystine-rich but has no free sulfhydryl groups. There is heterogeneity in carbohydrate content among the monomeric chains of intact fibronectin and the 200,000-dalton fragments. The gelatin binding site of fibronectin is in the 200,000 fragment. Intact disulfide bonds are required for binding of fibronectin to cells and to gelatin and blockage of the free sulfhydryl groups prevents binding of fibronectin to cells, suggesting that intermolecular disulfide bonding may be important."
https://openalex.org/W1549928772,"Calmodulin, a heat-stable Ca2+-binding protein (Mr = 16,700) found in all eukaryotes, is a multifunctional modulator, mediating many of the effects of Ca2+ in cellular functions. The protein was derivatized with 1-fluoro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (DNB) to give 3 mol of DNB/mol of calmodulin (DNB3-calmodulin). The dinitrophenylated protein was almost as active as native calmodulin in stimulating bovine brain Ca2+-dependent phosphodiesterase. Incorporation of the dinitrophenyl groups renders calmodulin highly antigenic in the rabbit; native calmodulin is a weak antigen. Rabbits immunized with DNB3-calmodulin produced specific antibody against both DNB3-calmodulin and calmodulin. Using the immunized serum, a radioimmunoassay was developed for calmodulin, the sensitivity for DNB3-calmodulin and calmodulin being approximately 0.2 and 2 pmol, respectively. Although the sensitivity of the radioimmunoassay for calmodulin is comparable to the enzyme assay of calmodulin with Ca2+-dependent phosphodiesterase, the radioimmunoassay affords the detection of calmodulin on the basis of antigenic determinants, and thus measures calmodulin in terms of polypeptide structure instead of its ability to stimulate an enzyme. Further, the accuracy of the radioimmunoassay is not affected by the presence of a heat-labile inhibitor protein, which affects the enzyme assay to give an apparent underestimation."
https://openalex.org/W1578495471,"Bovine prothrombin contains three asparagine-linked sugar chains in 1 molecule. The sugar chains were quantitatively released from the polypeptide backbone by hydrazinolysis. All of the oligosaccharides thus obtained contain N-acetylneuraminic acid. Sialidase treatment of these acidic oligosaccharides released three isomeric oligosaccharides, N-1, N-2 and N-3. N-3 was a typical complex type asparagine-linked sugar chain widely found in other glycoprotein, while N-1 and N-2 were unique, because they contain Gal beta 1 leads to 3GlcNAc grouping in the outer chain moiety. By comparing the data of methylation analysis of the acidic oligosaccharides before and after sialidase treatment, the structures of the sugar chains of bovine prothrombin were confirmed as a mixture of NeuAc alpha 2 leads to 6Gal beta 1 leads to 4GlcNAc beta 1 leads to 2Man alpha 1 leads to 6(NeuAc alpha 2 leads to 6Gal beta 1 leads to 4GlcNAc beta 1 leads to 2Man alpha 1 leads to 3)Man beta 1 leads to 4GlcNAc beta 1 leads to 4GlcNAc leads to Asn, NeuAc alpha 2 leads to 6Gal beta 1 leads to 4GlcNAc beta 1 leads to 2Man alpha 1 leads to 6[NeuAc alpha 2 leads to 3Gal beta 1 leads to 3(NeuAc alpha 2 leads to 6)GlcNAc beta 1 leads to 2Man alpha 1 leads to 3]Man beta 1 leads to 4GlcNAc beta 1 leads to 4GlcNAc leads to Asn, NeuAc alpha 2 leads to 3Gal beta 1 leads to 3(NeuAc alpha 2 leads to 6)GlcNAc beta 1 leads to 2Man alpha 1 leads to 6[NeuAc alpha 2 leads to 3Gal beta 1 leads to 3(NeuAc alpha 2 leads to 6)GlcNAc beta 1 leads to 2Man alpha 1 leads to 3]Man beta 1 leads to 4GlcNAc beta 1 leads to 4GlcNAc leads to Asn and their partially desialized forms."
https://openalex.org/W1608409567,"Isolated bone cells demonstrate cell-type specific responses to glucocorticoids. Osteoclast-like (OC) cells exhibit a large decrease in basal hyaluronate synthesis at physiological doses of glucocorticoids and resistance to further inhibition by pharmacological doses up to 10(-4) M. This effect is not accompanied by decreases in protein synthesis. In contrast, osteoblast-like (OB) cell metabolism is not inhibited by physiological doses of glucocorticoids. However, in OB cells both citrate decarboxylation and collagen synthesis are decreased at pharmacological doses of glucocorticoids and these effects are accompanied by a decrease in general protein synthesis. In addition to these effects on basal and general cell activities, physiological doses of glucocorticoids modulate the hormonal sensitivity of OC and OB bone cells such that lower concentrations of bovine parathyroid hormone (PTH) are necessary to elicit measurable biochemical changes. As a result, the presence of glucocorticoids permits significant responses to PTH to be detected at doses as low as 2 x 10(-13) M in OC and OB bone cells."
https://openalex.org/W1563895541,"This report describes the results of our initial enzymological characterization of a homogeneous preparation of DNA polymerase alpha that we have purified from cultured human KB cells. Although the enzyme is most reactive with duplex DNA substrates that contain short gaps (optimally activated) in incubations that require Mg2+, the polymerase possesses the intrinsic capacity to copy the initiated ribohomopolymer template, (A)-n, (dT)-200, at low rates in the presence of Mn2+. Because of the preponderance of DNA polymerase alpha in actively multiplying vertebrate cells, it is probable that this low level of activity comprises the majority of the ribopolymer copying activity that can be detected in crude tissue extracts. The presence of contaminating or associated deoxyribonuclease activities can be excluded from the purified enzyme to levels of 10(-4) to 10(-7) of the polymerase activity. The mechanism of polymerization on activated DNA under optimum conditions is moderately processive, with 11 +/- 5 nucleotides incorporated per polymerization cycle. The polymerase is unable to work at nicks or at short gaps of approximately 20 to 30 nucleotides in length, and it measures a surprisingly invariant effective template length on optimally activated DNA and on DNA molecules that have been gapped to varying extents with Escherichia coli exonuclease III. In the Appendix we present an amplification of the theoretical formulation of Bambara et al. (Bambara, R. A., Uyemura, D., and Choi, T. (1978) J. Biol. Chem. 253, 413--423) that permits the use of DNA polymerases with significant associated 3' leads to 5'-exonuclease activities for the accurate measurement of average template lengths (gap sizes) and titration of usable 3'-hydroxyl primer termini in gapped, duplex DNA substrates."

https://openalex.org/W1503540314,"Three distinct proteins, actin (42,000 daltons), the principal form of fibroblast 10 nm filament protein (55,000 daltons), and a protein with a molecular weight of 52,000 and a pI of 5.8 were detected in nonionic detergent-insoluble cytoskeletal and 10 nm filament preparations of control BHK21/C13 and line 9 hamster fibroblasts. Cytoskeletal preparations of other hamster fibroblast cell types, such as NIL8 and primary embryo fibroblasts, contained the 55,000-dalton component but lacked the 52,000-dalton protein. A Rous sarcoma virus transformant of the BHK21/C13 line and an adenovirus transformant of line 9, resembled the NIL8 and other fibroblast types in that they contained only the 55,000- and 42,000-dalton polypeptides. The identity of the 52,000-dalton protein in BHK21/C13 cells was studied. This protein co-electrophoreses on both one- and two-dimensional polyacrylamide gels with the predominant muscle form of 10 nm filament protein. Further, one-dimensional peptide maps of the hamster smooth muscle 10 nm filament protein and the hamster fibroblast 52,000-dalton protein are identical to one another and distinct from the peptide maps of both the 42,000- and the 55,000-dalton components of the fibroblast cytoskeletal preparations. We conclude that BHK21/C13 cells contain both the fibroblast and the muscle form of 10 nm filament protein."

https://openalex.org/W1603516624,"The action of purified bovine milk lipoprotein lipase on tri[3H]oleoylglycerol and the effect of albumin on movement of lipolytic products at an argon-water interface were studied in a specially designed tricomparted trough. The amount of trioleoylglycerol applied was 14 times that needed to cover the surface of the aqueous subphase (0.1 M Tris . HCl, pH 7.4) with a monolayer. It is concluded that trioleoylglycerol was present in lenses on the surface of the aqueous subphase, that hydrolysis by lipoprotein lipase occurred in or near the lipid/argon-water interface, and that lipolytic products immediately located and spread throughout the interface, displacing substances with lower spreading pressures from the interface. Addition of albumin to the aqueous subphase accelerated markedly the desorption of oleic acid and monooleoylglycerol from the interface and thereby enhanced lipolysis. When albumin was not contiguous with the site of hydrolysis, oleic acid and monooleoylglycerol readily moved in the interface to the area of contact with albumin where they were desorbed from the interface. These findings support the hypothesis of transport of lipolytic products by lateral movement in cell membranes."
https://openalex.org/W98229199,"Hypoxia and anoxia were induced in isolated perfused rat hearts by reduction of perfusate oxygen tension. Ischemia was produced by restricting coronary flow in hearts working against high resistance. Protein degradation was estimated from release of free phenylalanine in the presence of cycloheximide, and from dilution of the specific radioactivity of perfusate phenylalanine. Both anoxia and ischemia inhibited protein degradation as compared to unpaced or paced aerobic control hearts, respectively. The effect of ischemia was greater than that of anoxia. Estimates of net phenylalanine release, in the absence of cycloheximide, suggested that rates of protein synthesis and degradation were more nearly in balance in ischemic, than in anoxic hearts. Although insulin inhibited proteolysis in aerobic tissues, no effect of the hormone was evident in energy-poor hearts. Anoxia and ischemia appeared to affect initial steps in the degradative pathway as evidenced by inhibition of the decrease in activity of Sadenosylmethionine decarboxylase. Inhibition of proteolysis in energy-poor hearts was accompanied by decreased latency of the lysosomal enzymes, P-acetylglucosaminidase and cathepsin D. A progressive reduction in perfusate oxygen tension (hypoxia) indicated that protein degradation was reduced significantly when perfusates were gassed with 30% 02, although levels of nucleotides and creatine phosphate were normal. Anoxia led to depletion of high energy phosphates and more marked inhibition of proteolysis. Lactate and hydrogen ions, metabolites that accumulate in ischemic hearts, inhibited proteolysis in aerobic and anoxic tissues. These results indicate that inhibition of protein degradation may involve both energy-depletion and metabolite accumulation."
https://openalex.org/W1597583121,"Human erythrocyte membranes contain a major transmembrane protein, known as Band 3, that is involved in anion transport. This protein contains a total of five reactive sulfhydryl groups, which can be assigned to either of two classes on the basis of their susceptibility to release from the membrane by trypsin. Two of the groups are located in the region COOH-terminal to the extracellular chymotrypsin-sensitive site of the protein and remain with a membrane-bound 55,000-dalton fragment generated by trypsin treatment. The three sulfhydryl groups NH2-terminal to the extracellular chymotrypsin site are released from the cytoplasmic surface of the membrane by trypsin. All three groups are present in a 20,000-dalton tryptic fragment of Band 3. Two of these groups are located very close to the sites of trypsin cleavage that generate the 20,000-dalton fragment. The third reactve group is probably located about 15,000-daltons from the most NH2-terminal sulfhydryl group. Two other well defined fragments of the protein do not contain reactive sulfhydryl groups. They are a 23,000-dalton fragment derived from the NH2-terminal end that is also released by trypsin from the cytoplasmic surface of the membrane and a 19,000-dalton membrane-bound region of the protein that is produced by treatment with chymotrypsin in ghosts. The 20,000-dalton tryptic fragment may, therefore, constitute a sulfhydryl-containing domain of the Band 3 protein."

The inactivation is accompanied by incorporation of radioactivity from [1-14C]bromooctanoate into the enzyme. Bromooctanoate does not affect the activities of the other enzymes of beta-oxidation, except for 3-ketothiolase II (acetyl-CoA:acetyl-CoA C-acetyltransferase), which becomes partially inhibited.

These studies show that degradation of receptor-bound 125I-alpha-bungarotoxin is a valid measure of junctional receptor degradation. Degradation of junctional receptor is similar or identical to degradation of extrajunctional receptor in many ways: 1) both require energy, 2) both are inhibited by specific lysosomal protease inhibitors, 3) both are inhibited by treatment with colchicine, and 4) both are stimulated by treatment with anti-acetylcholine receptor antibodies. The one important distinction between degradation of junctional and extrajunctional receptor is a 10-fold difference in rate constant for the process."

The rate of inactivation increases with pH and reflects a group with a pKa of 7.5. Inactivated enzyme is in the holo form with intact FMN. Four histidyls and a cysteinyl residue are modified by excess reagent. The restoration of enzymatic activity by hydroxylamine, the spectrophotometric and colorimetric amino acid analyses, and our previous studies on cysteine modification (Tsuge, H., and McCormick, D.B. (1979) in Flavins and Flavoproteins (Yamano, T., and Yagi, K., eds) Japan Scientific Societies Press, Tokyo, in press) all suggest that inactivation occurs solely by modification of histidine. Analyses by kinetic and statistical methods indicate that three histidines are modified slowly and are not critical for activity, while one histidine is modified nine times more rapidly and accounts for the observed inactivation. Inactivated enzyme shows no significant perturbations in structure, as evidenced by absorption, CD, fluorescence, and gel filtration, but is unable to bind the product, pyridoxal 5'-phosphate. Furthermore, the substrate-competitive inhibitor, pyridoxal 5'-phosphate oxime, protects from inactivation. Hence, diethylpyrocarbonate inactivates this enzyme by modifying a crucial histidyl residue at the substrate/product-binding site."
https://openalex.org/W1577967263,"Highly purified hepatic microsomal epoxide hydrase, which had been purified in the presence of proteolytic enzyme inhibitors, was subjected to carboxypeptidase Y digestion, automated Edman degradation, and carbohydrate analysis. Carboxypeptidase Y digestion resulted in the near stoichiometric release of leucine, the COOH-terminal amino acid. Automated Edman degradation permitted the identification of the first 20 amino acid residues of epoxide hydrase. Methionine was identified as the NH2-terminal residue. The NH2-terminal region of epoxide hydrase is similar in hydrophobicity to the NH2-terminal precursor segments of several secretory proteins and the NH2-terminal regions of several microsomal cytochromes P-450. Carbohydrate analyses of the enzyme revealed the presence of 0.5 to 1.0 mol of mannose/50,000 g of protein. These results provide evidence for the presence of a single polypeptide chain in our purified enzyme preparations and suggest that there may be only one enzymic form of epoxide hydrase in microsomes from phenobarbital-treated rats."

We conclude that in the chronic phase of experimental autoimmune myasthenia gravis increased acetylcholine receptor degradation can be accounted for by a mechanism involving antigenic modulation, and that such a process can contribute to the clinical symptoms of impaired neuromuscular transmission."
https://openalex.org/W1562695121,"Secretory component from human milk was found to contain 23.4% carbohydrate, which includes galactose, mannose, fucose, glucosamine, and sialic acid. Secretory component could be degraded by pronase or base-borohydride to yield the same, single type of carbohydrate chain. In the glycopeptide produced by pronase digestion, aspartic acid was the only amino acid present in molar quantities after amino acid analysis, which suggests that the carbohydrate moiety is linked to the polypeptide chain at asparagine residues. The positions of links between the various sugar units were studied by methylation analyses of: secretory component, periodate-oxidized and reduced secretory component, the fragment produced by base-borohydride treatment, and the pronase glycopeptide after treatment with specific glycosidases. Sugars released from the glycopeptide by various glycosidases were also quantitated. From the results of these studies a branched chain structure was assigned to the carbohydrate chain of secretory component."

https://openalex.org/W1594677697,"delta-Aminolevulinic acid synthetase has been purified from liver mitochondria of young, uninduced rats. After nonionic detergent solubilization of mitochondrial inner membrane-matrix fractions, the enzyme was purified to a specific activity of approximately 2,000 nmol of delta-aminolevulinic acid formed/h/mg of protein at 30 degrees C, by means of ammonium sulfate precipitation, diethylaminoethyl cellulose chromatography, Sephacryl chromatography, and preparative gel electrophoresis. The purified enzyme preparation thus obtained was apparently homogeneous as judged by its migration as a single band with a molecular weight of 58,000 +/- 6,000 upon electrophoresis in sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gels. The native enzyme probably exists as a dimer with a molecular weight of approximately 120,000. A pH optimum of 7.5 and an isoelectric point of 4.5 were also determined. Both monovalent cations and hemin strongly inhibited the activity of the purified enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W572878370,"In the laying hen the egg yolk proteins are synthesized in the liver. Some of these proteins, such as vitellogenin, are synthesized exclusively by the hen, while others, such as low density lipoprotein, are also synthesized by the rooster, but at a very low rate. Treatment of the rooster with estradiol, however, results in synthesis of the complete spectrum of egg yolk proteins at a rate comparable to that characteristic of the hen. We are interested in mechanisms that coordinate regulation of this group of estrogen-responsive genes and to this end have developed a procedure for selecting and cloning members of the group that exhibit common induction ratios. Complexity analyses carried out on total RNA isolated from rooster liver at different stages of the vitellogenic response suggested that the family of the estrogen-inducible mRNA species was located primarily in the abundant and intermediate complexity classes of mRNA and that the population of the complex class remained essentially unchanged throughout the vitellogenic response. This conclusion was confirmed by more detailed analyses using isolated cDNA fractions corresponding to individual abundance classes. We have used the information provided by these analyses to isolate cDNA probes specific for estrogen-inducible sequences of a particular abundance and exhibiting a particular induction ratio. The first probe that we have isolated in this fashion is specific for sequences that are induced by estrogen at least lOOO-fold. It is composed predominantly of sequences derived from two species of mRNA, vitellogenin and another, as yet uncharacterized mRNA, approximately 800 nucleotides long. pis cDNA probe has been used in the selection and isolation of cDNA clones containing both of these sequences."
https://openalex.org/W1537954666,"For some time it has been known that the side chain of cholesterol sulfate is cleaved by the cleavage enzyme system present in bovine adrenal mitochondria without prior hydrolysis of the sulfate moiety. In this work, other inorganic esters as well as some organic esters of cholesterol were tested as substrates for this enzyme system. The results revealed that cholesterol nitrate, cholesterol phosphate, and a series of acyl esters of cholesterol can also be cleaved by the enzyme system to their respective pregnenolone derivatives without first being hydrolyzed to cholesterol. The rate of oxidation of the carboxylic acid esters decreased as the size of the acyl groups increased. Cholesterol stearate and cholesterol phosphate were demonstrated to be inhibitors of the side chain cleavage of cholesterol. While digitonin, as might be expected, inhibits the cleavage of cholesterol, it accelerates the oxidation of both cholesterol sulfate and cholesterol nitrate. The results reported in this paper add support to the previously proposed hypothesis that more than one cholesterol side chain cleavage enzyme system exists in adrenal mitochondria."
https://openalex.org/W1575856957,"Reovirus mRNA synthesis in vitro by the virion-associated RNA polymerase was only slightly (10 to 15%) diminished in the presence of 2 mM S-adenosylethionine. However, methyl group transfer from S-adenosylmethionine (0.05 mM) to the 5'-terminal cap structure, m7GpppGm in this mRNA was markedly inhibited (80%) under these conditions. Replacement of S-adenosylmethionine by S-adenosylethionine (5 mM) yielded mRNAs containing mainly (70%) 5'-terminal e7GpppGe and e7GpppG, but some of the products were unalkylated (5'-GpppG, ppG). The ethylated mRNAs, but not the unalkylated molecules, bound to wheat germ ribosomes and were translated essentially as well as the corresponding methylated mRNAs in wheat germ extracts and in nuclease-treated rabbit reticulocyte lysates. Protein synthesis directed by ethylated mRNAs in wheat germ extract was 80% decreased by 0.1 mM m7GMP. Under conditions of limited initiation, methylated mRNA bound to wheat germ ribosomes preferentially as compared to ethylated mRNA. The results document for the first time the synthesis of ethylated mRNA and support the hypothesis that N7-alkylation of the 5'-guanosine in caps, rather than methylation itself, is important for the enhancing effect of cap on the initiation of eukaryotic protein synthesis."

https://openalex.org/W1567982912,"Abstract The reaction of tryptamine with indolyl-3-alkane alpha-hydroxylase is shown to remove stereospecifically the pro-S hydrogen at C-2 of the side chain and to give hydroxytryptamine of R configuration. The reaction therefore proceeds stereospecifically with net inversion of configuration at C-2 of the tryptamine side chain. In the reaction of L-tryptophan methyl ester, the enzyme also catalyzes stereospecific removal of the pro-S hydrogen at C-3, but the product 3-hydroxytryptophan methyl ester is racemic at C-3. The unreacted tryptophan methyl ester is shown to incorporate solvent hydrogen into the pro-S position at C-3 in an at least partially stereospecific manner, suggesting that the reaction of L-tryptophan methyl ester is reversible. The hydrogens at C-1 of the tryptamine side chain and the alpha-hydrogen of L-tryptophan methyl ester are shown to be retained in the reactions. The results support the notion that the enzyme catalyzes stereospecific 1,4-dehydrogenation of 3-substituted indoles to the coresponding alkylidene indolenines as the primary reaction, followed by stereospecific or nonstereospecific hydration of these intermediates as a secondary process. Substrate specificity studies with a number of tryptophan analogs are in excellent agreement with such a mechanism."
