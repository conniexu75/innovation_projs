https://openalex.org/W4220784902,"Abstract There is strong evidence of brain-related abnormalities in COVID-19 1–13 . However, it remains unknown whether the impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection can be detected in milder cases, and whether this can reveal possible mechanisms contributing to brain pathology. Here we investigated brain changes in 785 participants of UK Biobank (aged 51–81 years) who were imaged twice using magnetic resonance imaging, including 401 cases who tested positive for infection with SARS-CoV-2 between their two scans—with 141 days on average separating their diagnosis and the second scan—as well as 384 controls. The availability of pre-infection imaging data reduces the likelihood of pre-existing risk factors being misinterpreted as disease effects. We identified significant longitudinal effects when comparing the two groups, including (1) a greater reduction in grey matter thickness and tissue contrast in the orbitofrontal cortex and parahippocampal gyrus; (2) greater changes in markers of tissue damage in regions that are functionally connected to the primary olfactory cortex; and (3) a greater reduction in global brain size in the SARS-CoV-2 cases. The participants who were infected with SARS-CoV-2 also showed on average a greater cognitive decline between the two time points. Importantly, these imaging and cognitive longitudinal effects were still observed after excluding the 15 patients who had been hospitalised. These mainly limbic brain imaging results may be the in vivo hallmarks of a degenerative spread of the disease through olfactory pathways, of neuroinflammatory events, or of the loss of sensory input due to anosmia. Whether this deleterious effect can be partially reversed, or whether these effects will persist in the long term, remains to be investigated with additional follow-up."
https://openalex.org/W4220729480,"Critical COVID-19 is caused by immune-mediated inflammatory lung injury. Host genetic variation influences the development of illness requiring critical care1 or hospitalization2-4 after infection with SARS-CoV-2. The GenOMICC (Genetics of Mortality in Critical Care) study enables the comparison of genomes from individuals who are critically ill with those of population controls to find underlying disease mechanisms. Here we use whole-genome sequencing in 7,491 critically ill individuals compared with 48,400 controls to discover and replicate 23 independent variants that significantly predispose to critical COVID-19. We identify 16 new independent associations, including variants within genes that are involved in interferon signalling (IL10RB and PLSCR1), leucocyte differentiation (BCL11A) and blood-type antigen secretor status (FUT2). Using transcriptome-wide association and colocalization to infer the effect of gene expression on disease severity, we find evidence that implicates multiple genes-including reduced expression of a membrane flippase (ATP11A), and increased expression of a mucin (MUC1)-in critical disease. Mendelian randomization provides evidence in support of causal roles for myeloid cell adhesion molecules (SELE, ICAM5 and CD209) and the coagulation factor F8, all of which are potentially druggable targets. Our results are broadly consistent with a multi-component model of COVID-19 pathophysiology, in which at least two distinct mechanisms can predispose to life-threatening disease: failure to control viral replication; or an enhanced tendency towards pulmonary inflammation and intravascular coagulation. We show that comparison between cases of critical illness and population controls is highly efficient for the detection of therapeutically relevant mechanisms of disease."
https://openalex.org/W4214920620,"Motor behaviors are often planned long before execution but only released after specific sensory events. Planning and execution are each associated with distinct patterns of motor cortex activity. Key questions are how these dynamic activity patterns are generated and how they relate to behavior. Here, we investigate the multi-regional neural circuits that link an auditory ""Go cue"" and the transition from planning to execution of directional licking. Ascending glutamatergic neurons in the midbrain reticular and pedunculopontine nuclei show short latency and phasic changes in spike rate that are selective for the Go cue. This signal is transmitted via the thalamus to the motor cortex, where it triggers a rapid reorganization of motor cortex state from planning-related activity to a motor command, which in turn drives appropriate movement. Our studies show how midbrain can control cortical dynamics via the thalamus for rapid and precise motor behavior."

In this study, we discovered that local hyperthermia therapy (LHT) targeting beige fat promoted its activation in humans and mice. LHT achieved using a hydrogel-based photothermal therapy activated beige fat, preventing and treating obesity in mice without adverse effects. HSF1 is required for the effects since HSF1 deficiency blunted the metabolic benefits of LHT. HSF1 regulates Hnrnpa2b1 (A2b1) transcription, leading to increased mRNA stability of key metabolic genes. Importantly, analysis of human association studies followed by functional analysis revealed that the HSF1 gain-of-function variant p.P365T is associated with improved metabolic performance in humans and increased A2b1 transcription in mice and cells. Overall, we demonstrate that LHT offers a promising strategy against obesity by inducing beige fat activation via HSF1-A2B1 transcriptional axis."
https://openalex.org/W4214871091,"Misfolding and aggregation of disease-specific proteins, resulting in the formation of filamentous cellular inclusions, is a hallmark of neurodegenerative disease with characteristic filament structures, or conformers, defining each proteinopathy. Here we show that a previously unsolved amyloid fibril composed of a 135 amino acid C-terminal fragment of TMEM106B is a common finding in distinct human neurodegenerative diseases, including cases characterized by abnormal aggregation of TDP-43, tau, or α-synuclein protein. A combination of cryoelectron microscopy and mass spectrometry was used to solve the structures of TMEM106B fibrils at a resolution of 2.7 Å from postmortem human brain tissue afflicted with frontotemporal lobar degeneration with TDP-43 pathology (FTLD-TDP, n = 8), progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP, n = 2), or dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB, n = 1). The commonality of abundant amyloid fibrils composed of TMEM106B, a lysosomal/endosomal protein, to a broad range of debilitating human disorders indicates a shared fibrillization pathway that may initiate or accelerate neurodegeneration."
https://openalex.org/W4220688888,"As one of the most induced genes in activated macrophages, immune-responsive gene 1 (IRG1) encodes a mitochondrial metabolic enzyme catalysing the production of itaconic acid (ITA). Although ITA has an anti-inflammatory property, the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. Here we show that ITA is a potent inhibitor of the TET-family DNA dioxygenases. ITA binds to the same site on TET2 as the co-substrate α-ketoglutarate, inhibiting TET2 catalytic activity. Lipopolysaccharide treatment, which induces Irg1 expression and ITA accumulation, inhibits Tet activity in macrophages. Transcriptome analysis reveals that TET2 is a major target of ITA in suppressing lipopolysaccharide-induced genes, including those regulated by the NF-κB and STAT signalling pathways. In vivo, ITA decreases the levels of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine, reduces lipopolysaccharide-induced acute pulmonary oedema as well as lung and liver injury, and protects mice against lethal endotoxaemia, depending on the catalytic activity of Tet2. Our study thus identifies ITA as an immune modulatory metabolite that selectively inhibits TET enzymes to dampen the inflammatory responses."

There are no curative treatments for biliary disease except for liver transplantation. New therapies are urgently required. We have therefore purified human biliary epithelial cells (hBECs) from human livers that were not used for liver transplantation. hBECs were tested as a cell therapy in a mouse model of biliary disease in which the conditional deletion of Mdm2 in cholangiocytes causes senescence, biliary strictures, and fibrosis. hBECs are expandable and phenotypically stable and help restore biliary structure and function, highlighting their regenerative capacity and a potential alternative to liver transplantation for biliary disease."
https://openalex.org/W4214834735,"Region-related heterogeneity and state transitions of microglia are important for brain development and neurological pathogenesis. However, regional specialization and state transition in microglia during early human CNS development remain unclear. Here, we profile single-cell transcriptomes of microglia from distinct regions of the developing human brain, and combined with experimental verification, we define and characterize early microglial fate determinations related to regional specification and state transition. We identified several subclasses of neuronal gene-enriched microglia with regional specification that dynamically and transiently appeared as early brain regions formed. In contrast, immune-related microglia were regionally specialized at later stages of CNS development. Surprisingly, we discovered that region-specialized immune-related microglia exit from a relative resting state and transition into distinct active states. In addition, we experimentally verified the microglial state transition. Finally, we showed that the state transition is conserved but that there are molecular differences in developing microglia in humans and mice."

This method uses the codec structure and multi-task ideas, shares the feature extraction network and feature enhancement and fusion module. Both ASPP (Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling) and FPN (Feature Pyramid Networks) are employed to improve the feature extraction ability and real-time of MobileNetV3, the attention mechanism CBAM (Convolutional Block Attention Module) is introduced into YOLOv4, an asymmetric network architecture of ""more encoding-less decoding"" is designed for semantic pixel-wise segmentation network. The proposed model employed improved MobileNetV3 as feature ex-traction block, and the YOLOv4-CBAM and Asymmetric SegNet as branches to detect vehicles and lane lines, respectively. The model is trained and tested on the BDD100K data set, and is also tested on the KITTI data set and Chongqing road images, and focuses on the detection effect in the car following scene. The experimental results show that the proposed model surpasses the YOLOv4 by a large margin of +1.1 AP50, +0.9 Recall, +0.7 F1 and +0.3 Precision, and surpasses the SegNet by a large margin of +1.2 IoU on BDD100k. At the same time, the detection speed is 1.7 times and 3.2 times of YOLOv4 and SegNet, respectively. It fully proves the feasibility and effectiveness of the improved method."

https://openalex.org/W4214901844,"Although there have been recent transformative advances in the area of protein structure prediction, prediction of point mutations that improve protein stability remains challenging. It is possible to construct and screen large mutant libraries for improved activity or ligand binding. However, reliable screens for mutants that improve protein stability do not yet exist, especially for proteins that are well folded and relatively stable. Here, we demonstrate that incorporation of a single, specific, destabilizing mutation termed parent inactivating mutation into each member of a single-site saturation mutagenesis library, followed by screening for suppressors, allows for robust and accurate identification of stabilizing mutations. We carried out fluorescence-activated cell sorting of such a yeast surface display, saturation suppressor library of the bacterial toxin CcdB, followed by deep sequencing of sorted populations. We found that multiple stabilizing mutations could be identified after a single round of sorting. In addition, multiple libraries with different parent inactivating mutations could be pooled and simultaneously screened to further enhance the accuracy of identification of stabilizing mutations. Finally, we show that individual stabilizing mutations could be combined to result in a multi-mutant that demonstrated an increase in thermal melting temperature of about 20 °C, and that displayed enhanced tolerance to high temperature exposure. We conclude that as this method is robust and employs small library sizes, it can be readily extended to other display and screening formats to rapidly isolate stabilized protein mutants."
https://openalex.org/W4214834963,"Mucins and glycoproteins with mucin-like regions contain densely O-glycosylated domains often found in tandem repeat (TR) sequences. These O-glycodomains have traditionally been difficult to characterize because of their resistance to proteolytic digestion, and knowledge of the precise positions of O-glycans is particularly limited for these regions. Here, we took advantage of a recently developed glycoengineered cell-based platform for the display and production of mucin TR reporters with custom-designed O-glycosylation to characterize O-glycodomains derived from mucins and mucin-like glycoproteins. We combined intact mass and bottom-up site-specific analysis for mapping O-glycosites in the mucins, MUC2, MUC20, MUC21, protein P-selectin-glycoprotein ligand 1, and proteoglycan syndecan-3. We found that all the potential Ser/Thr positions in these O-glycodomains were O-glycosylated when expressed in human embryonic kidney 293 SimpleCells (Tn-glycoform). Interestingly, we found that all potential Ser/Thr O-glycosites in TRs derived from secreted mucins and most glycosites from transmembrane mucins were almost fully occupied, whereas TRs from a subset of transmembrane mucins were less efficiently processed. We further used the mucin TR reporters to characterize cleavage sites of glycoproteases StcE (secreted protease of C1 esterase inhibitor from EHEC) and BT4244, revealing more restricted substrate specificities than previously reported. Finally, we conducted a bottom-up analysis of isolated ovine submaxillary mucin, which supported our findings that mucin TRs in general are efficiently O-glycosylated at all potential glycosites. This study provides insight into O-glycosylation of mucins and mucin-like domains, and the strategies developed open the field for wider analysis of native mucins."
https://openalex.org/W4220670629,"The pandemic has posed an intense threat to the mental health of younger adults. Despite significant efforts in studying various aspects of COVID-19, there is a dearth of evidence on how negative emotions are associated with behaviors. A comparison across associated factors to different negative emotions by means of a unified model is especially missing from the literature. This study was conducted by using the results of a survey conducted across 2,534 students enrolled in 7 states in the US. Various feelings such as sad, irritable, stress and guilt were analyzed in a unified model by means of seemingly unrelated regression (SUR). Questions were asked related to rationally limiting the spread of virus, and questions related to behaviors that seem to be extreme. Irrational behaviors, such as limiting exercise at home due to COVID-19 could be due to experiencing negative emotions, which distort the meaning of events for the students. That behavior, for instance, was found to be positively associated with various negative feelings. In addition, the results highlighted significant differences across emotions in terms of demographic characteristics such as gender and age, and various precautionary actions that students take, such as limiting outdoor activities or limiting social gathering. For instance, it was highlighted while avoiding a large group of people, in spite of its importance in curbing the spread of virus, is negatively associated with various negative emotions, taking a possible nonconsequential precaution of completely limiting all people outside the immediate family result in a higher level of negative emotions. Also, it was found that having a higher body mass index (BMI), self-rated worse health conditions, and limiting outdoor activities have detrimental effects on the mental health of students."
https://openalex.org/W4220732371,"Cranberry ( Vaccinium macrocarpon ) is a member of the Heath family (Ericaceae) and is a temperate low-growing woody perennial native to North America that is both economically important and has significant health benefits. While some native varieties are still grown today, breeding programs over the past 50 years have made significant contributions to improving disease resistance, fruit quality and yield. An initial genome sequence of an inbred line of the wild selection ‘Ben Lear,’ which is parent to multiple breeding programs, provided insight into the gene repertoire as well as a platform for molecular breeding. Recent breeding efforts have focused on leveraging the circumboreal V . oxycoccos , which forms interspecific hybrids with V . macrocarpon , offering to bring in novel fruit chemistry and other desirable traits. Here we present an updated, chromosome-resolved V . macrocarpon reference genome, and compare it to a high-quality draft genome of V . oxycoccos . Leveraging the chromosome resolved cranberry reference genome, we confirmed that the Ericaceae has undergone two whole genome duplications that are shared with blueberry and rhododendron. Leveraging resequencing data for ‘Ben Lear’ inbred lines, as well as several wild and elite selections, we identified common regions that are targets of improvement. These same syntenic regions in V . oxycoccos , were identified and represent environmental response and plant architecture genes. These data provide insight into early genomic selection in the domestication of a native North American berry crop."
https://openalex.org/W4214845357,"Aquaporins (AQPs) are a kind of transmembrane proteins that exist in various organs of the human body. AQPs play an important role in regulating water transport, lipid metabolism and glycolysis of cells. Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is a common malignant tumor of the kidney, and the prognosis is worse than other types of renal cell cancer (RCC). The impact of AQPs on the prognosis of ccRCC and the potential relationship between AQPs and the occurrence and development of ccRCC are demanded to be investigated. In this study, we first explored the expression pattern of AQPs by using Oncomine, UALCAN, and HPA databases. Secondly, we constructed protein-protein interaction (PPI) network and performed function enrichment analysis through STRING, GeneMANIA, and Metascape. Then a comprehensive analysis of the genetic mutant frequency of AQPs in ccRCC was carried out using the cBioPortal database. In addition, we also analyzed the main enriched biological functions of AQPs and the correlation with seven main immune cells. Finally, we confirmed the prognostic value of AQPs throughGEPIA and Cox regression analysis. We found that the mRNA expression levels of AQP0/8/9/10 were up-regulated in patients with ccRCC, while those of AQP1/2/3/4/5/6/7/11 showed the opposite. Among them, the expression differences of AQP1/2/3/4/5/6/7/8/9/11 were statistically significant. The differences in protein expression levels of AQP1/2/3/4/5/6 in ccRCC and normal renal tissues were consistent with the change trends of mRNA. The biological functions of AQPs were mainly concentrated in water transport, homeostasis maintenance, glycerol transport, and intracellular movement of sugar transporters. The high mRNA expression levels of AQP0/8/9 were significantly correlated with worse overall survival (OS), while those of AQP1/4/7 were correlated with better OS. AQP0/1/4/9 were prognostic-related factors, and AQP1/9 were independent prognostic factors. In general, this research has investigated the values of AQPs in ccRCC, which could become new survival markers for ccRCC targeted therapy."
https://openalex.org/W4214946542,"A subset of eukaryotic tRNAs is methylated in the anticodon loop, forming 3-methylcytosine (m3C) modifications. In mammals, the number of tRNAs containing m3C modifications has been expanded to include mitochondrial (mt) tRNA-Ser-UGA and mt-tRNA-Thr-UGU. However, whereas the enzymes catalyzing m3C formation in nuclear-encoded tRNAs have been identified, the proteins responsible for m3C modification in mt-tRNAs are unknown. Here, we show that m3C formation in human mt-tRNAs is dependent upon the methyltransferase-Like 8 (METTL8) enzyme. We find that METTL8 is a mitochondria-associated protein that interacts with mitochondrial seryl-tRNA synthetase, as well as with mt-tRNAs containing m3C. We demonstrate that human cells deficient in METTL8 exhibit loss of m3C modification in mt-tRNAs, but not nuclear-encoded tRNAs. Consistent with the mitochondrial import of METTL8, the formation of m3C in METTL8-deficient cells could be rescued by re-expression of WT METTL8, but not by a METTL8 variant lacking the N-terminal mitochondrial localization signal. Notably, we found METTL8-deficiency in human cells causes alterations in the native migration pattern of mt-tRNA-Ser-UGA, suggesting a role for m3C in tRNA folding. Altogether, these findings demonstrate that METTL8 is required for m3C formation in mt-tRNAs and uncover a potential function for m3C modification in mitochondrial tRNA structure."
https://openalex.org/W4220754021,"Post-weaning diarrhea (PWD) in pigs has mainly an infectious basis and control strategies are centred on antibiotics added to the diet. Given concerns on the spread of multi-resistant bacteria, it is necessary to develop alternative prophylactic approaches to control PWD in piglets. The most promising alternative strategies are based on substances that act indirectly on the bacteria by stimulating the immune system or by improving gut health. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect on the gut microbiota of feed supplemented with a mixture of essential oils (garlic and oregano) in weaning piglets, compared to traditional PWD management (in-feed antibiotics) and to a control group without any diet supplementation. The study involved 197 piglets from 18 litters in a single farm. The piglets were followed from birth to day 58 of age and were weaned at day 26. During the experimental period, the animals were monitored for weight and growth, average daily gain, morbidity and mortality. For the metataxonomics analysis, rectal samples were collected from 17 piglets from the three experimental groups at 4 different time-points (days 1, 12, 26 and 58). Results revealed that the gut microbiota in pre- and post-weaning piglets was dominated by the phyla Firmicutes (51%), Bacteroidetes (25%) and Proteobacteria (16%), which together make up for over 90% of the entire piglet core gut microbiota. The core microbiota comprised 10 taxa before weaning and 43 taxa after weaning, with 7 taxa overlapping between timepoints: two of them (Prevotella 9, p-value = 0.00095; Solobacterium p-value = 0.00821) were significantly more abundant after weaning. All alpha diversity indexes were significantly different between pre- and post-weaning, while only Shannon and Simpson diversity and equitability were significantly different between treatments. Based on the matrix of Bray-Curtis dissimilarities, samples showed clear clustering per timepoint (before and after weaning, p-value < 0.001) and between treatments by timepoint (p-value = 0.0086). The oil-diet group showed a consistently higher F:B ratio at all timepoints. These results show that the pig gut microbiota changes significantly with weaning, and suggest that the use of essential oils as feed supplementation to control PWD does not seem to alter sgnificantly the microbiota nor the growth parameters of piglets, however modifications of specific taxa may occur."
https://openalex.org/W4221081790,"Epigenetic mechanisms regulate osteogenic lineage differentiation of mesenchymal stromal cells. Histone methylation is controlled by multiple lysine demethylases and is an important step in controlling local chromatin structure and gene expression. Here, we show that the lysine-specific histone demethylase Kdm1A/Lsd1 is abundantly expressed in osteoblasts and that its suppression impairs osteoblast differentiation and bone nodule formation in vitro. Although Lsd1 knockdown did not affect global H3K4 methylation levels, genome-wide ChIP-Seq analysis revealed high levels of Lsd1 at gene promoters and its binding was associated with di- and tri-methylation of histone 3 at lysine 4 (H3K4me2 and H3K4me3). Lsd1 binding sites in osteoblastic cells were enriched for the Runx2 consensus motif suggesting a functional link between the two proteins. Importantly, inhibition of Lsd1 activity decreased osteoblast activity in vivo. In support, mesenchymal-targeted knockdown of Lsd1 led to decreased osteoblast activity and disrupted primary spongiosa ossification and reorganization in vivo. Together, our studies demonstrate that Lsd1 occupies Runx2-binding cites at H3K4me2 and H3K4me3 and its activity is required for proper bone formation."
https://openalex.org/W4214895470,"Innovation is intrinsically dependent on the construction of local infrastructure. Using panel data on 285 cities in China, we empirically examined the impact of high-speed rails on urban innovation and the mechanism underlying this effect. We found that high-speed rails significantly increase urban innovation. In our analysis, high-speed rails were found to increase the agglomeration of innovation factors, including population and investment, which in turn increase urban technological innovation. The agglomeration of investment factors brought about by high-speed rails is the main source of the improvement in urban innovation. Through the use of a spatial panel model, we found that high-speed rails promote knowledge dissemination and technology spillovers among the cities along high-speed railways, thus improving their innovation levels. However, the existing effects of high-speed rails on innovation exhibit spatial heterogeneity. We confirmed the effect of high-speed rails on innovation and explored the mechanism underlying this effect by considering the effects of factor agglomeration and knowledge spillovers. Our conclusions can be used as a resource by policymakers to stimulate knowledge and technology diffusion, which in turn cultivates and stimulates urban innovation."
https://openalex.org/W4220735121,"Background Opportunistic infections (OIs) are the leading causes of hospitalization, morbidity, and mortality (accounting for 94.1% of all deaths) in people living with human immunodeficiency virus (PLHIV). Despite evidence suggested that undernutrition significantly increases the risk of OIs in PLHIV, to our knowledge, no study has examined the actual effects of undernutrition on OIs in this population, particularly in low-income countries. Thus, this study examined the effects of undernutrition on OIs in adults living with HIV receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART). Methods We conducted a retrospective cohort study among 841adults living with HIV receiving ART between June 2014 and June 2020 at Debre Markos Comprehensive Specialized Hospital, Northwest Ethiopia. Study participants were selected using a simple random sampling technique. Data from participants’ medical records were extracted using a project-specific data extraction checklist. The Kaplan Meier survival curve estimated the OIs free survival time. The effects of undernutrition on time to develop OIs was estimated using inverse-probability weighting. Finally, regression coefficients with 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were reported, with a statistical significance of p &lt; 0.05. Results Of 841 study participants, 262 (31.2%) developed OIs, and the overall incidence rate was 16.7 (95% CI: 14.8, 18.8) per 100 person-years. The incWidence of OIs in undernourished participants (21/100 person-years, 95% CI: 17.8, 27.4) was higher than well-nourished participants (15.0/100 person-years, 95% CI: 12.9, 17.4). When everyone in the population of interest is well-nourished, average time to develop OIs is estimated as 26.5 (coefficient: 26.5, 95% CI: 20.6, 32.4, p &lt; 0.001) months. When everyone in the population of interest is undernourished, average time to develop OIs is estimated as 17.7 (95% CI: 12.8, 22.6) months. However, when everyone is undernourished, average time to develop OIs decreases by 8.8 (coefficient: -8.8, 95% CI: -16.6, -1.0, p = 0.026) months. Lastly, exposure to undernourishment (intervention) (ratio of average treatment effects to well-nourished potential outcome means in this study was a 32.5% reduction in OIs among adults living with HIV on ART. Conclusion We found that undernutrition significantly shortened time to develop OIs in adults living with HIV. This implies that the occurrence of OIs in this vulnerable population can be improved through different cost-effective nutritional interventions, such as routine nutritional assessments and education."

However, little is known about WKCs' pattern of informal care provision, the support they receive, the impact providing care has on their employment, and how these vary between male and female WKCs. This study describes the pattern of informal care provision and received support among Swedish WKCs.The study was a cross-sectional questionnaire-based survey of a stratified random sample of the Swedish population aged 18 or over. The questionnaire addressed the type and extent of informal care provided, support received and the impact of care provision on employment. Of the 30,009 people who received the questionnaire, 11,168 (37.3%) responded, providing an analytic sample of 818 (7.32% of respondents) employed or self-employed informal carers.A typical Swedish WKC was a middle-aged female, providing weekly or daily care to a non-cohabitant parent, who experiences care as sometimes demanding and receives no formal support as a carer. Female WKCs were more likely than males to care alone and with higher intensity, to report a need for help in meeting their care-recipient's needs, and to experience care as demanding. Approximately 17% of WKCs reported their employment had been affected due to caring, 40% their ability to work, and 31% their career development opportunities. Female WKCs' ability to work was affected more than males', and they were more commonly prevented from applying for work.Swedish female WKCs compared to males provide more hours of informal care, across more care domains, more often alone. This places them in a challenging situation when combining paid work and care. Greater recognition of the challenges faced by WKCs is required in Sweden and other countries, as are policies to reduce gender inequalities in informal care provision in this group."
https://openalex.org/W4221134332,"Background Accurate projections of the future number of people with chronic diseases are necessary for effective resource allocation and health care planning in response to changes in disease burden. Aim To introduce and compare different projection methods to estimate the number of people with diagnosed type 2 diabetes (T2D) in Germany in 2040. Methods We compare three methods to project the number of males with T2D in Germany in 2040. Method 1) simply combines the sex- and age-specific prevalence of T2D in 2010 with future population distributions projected by the German Federal Statistical Office (FSO). Methods 2) and 3) additionally account for the incidence of T2D and mortality rates using partial differential equations (PDEs). Method 2) models the prevalence of T2D employing a scalar PDE which incorporates incidence and mortality rates. Subsequently, the estimated prevalence is applied to the population projection of the FSO. Method 3) uses a two-dimensional system of PDEs and estimates future case numbers directly while future mortality of people with and without T2D is modelled independently from the projection of the FSO. Results Method 1) projects 3.6 million male people with diagnosed T2D in Germany in 2040. Compared to 2.8 million males in 2010, this equals an increase by 29%. Methods 2) and 3) project 5.9 million (+104% compared to 2010) and 6.0 million (+116%) male T2D patients, respectively. Conclusions The results of the three methods differ substantially. It appears that ignoring temporal trends in incidence and mortality may result in misleading projections of the future number of people with chronic diseases. Hence, it is essential to include these rates as is done by method 2) and 3)."
https://openalex.org/W3208916817,"To represent the complex individual interactions in the dynamics of disease spread informed by data, the coupling of an epidemiological agent-based model with the ensemble Kalman filter is proposed. The statistical inference of the propagation of a disease by means of ensemble-based data assimilation systems has been studied in previous works. The models used are mostly compartmental models representing the mean field evolution through ordinary differential equations. These techniques allow to monitor the propagation of the infections from data and to estimate several parameters of epidemiological interest. However, there are many important features which are based on the individual interactions that cannot be represented in the mean field equations, such as social network and bubbles, contact tracing, isolating individuals in risk, and social network-based distancing strategies. Agent-based models can describe contact networks at an individual level, including demographic attributes such as age, neighborhood, household, workplaces, schools, entertainment places, among others. Nevertheless, these models have several unknown parameters which are thus difficult to prescribe. In this work, we propose the use of ensemble-based data assimilation techniques to calibrate an agent-based model using daily epidemiological data. This raises the challenge of having to adapt the agent populations to incorporate the information provided by the coarse-grained data. To do this, two stochastic strategies to correct the model predictions are developed. The ensemble Kalman filter with perturbed observations is used for the joint estimation of the state and some key epidemiological parameters. We conduct experiments with an agent based-model designed for COVID-19 and assess the proposed methodology on synthetic data and on COVID-19 daily reports from Ciudad Autónoma de Buenos Aires, Argentina."

However, further characterization of AD-related pathological events is urgently required. Here, we investigated the effects of pharmacological degradation or inhibition of BRD4 on AD cell models. Interestingly, we found that both degradation and inhibition of BRD4 by ARV-825 and JQ1, respectively, robustly increased the levels of amyloid-beta (Aβ), which has been associated with the neuropathology of AD. Subsequently, we characterized the mechanisms by which downregulation of BRD4 increases Aβ levels. We found that both degradation and inhibition of BRD4 increased the levels of BACE1, the enzyme responsible for cleavage of the amyloid-beta protein precursor (APP) to generate Aβ. Consistent with Aβ increase, we also found that downregulation of BRD4 increased AD-related phosphorylated Tau (pTau) protein in our 3D-AD human neural cell culture model. Therefore, our results suggest that downregulation of BRD4 would not be a viable strategy for AD intervention. Collectively, our study not only shows that BRD4 is a novel epigenetic component that regulates BACE1 and Aβ levels, but also provides novel and translational insights into the targeting of BRD4 for potential clinical applications."

Nevertheless, the prevalence of burnout syndrome among this critical population remains unknown. The purpose of this study was to estimate the prevalence rate of burnout and its associated factors in a sample of resident physicians in Sudan.A cross-sectional design was used to assess the burnout syndrome among resident physicians at the teaching hospitals of Wad-Medani in Gezira state, east-central Sudan. Three hundred resident physicians at the dermatology, general surgery, pediatrics, obstetrics and gynecology, psychiatry, ear, nose and throat (ENT), oncology, urology, and internal medicine departments, were approached and invited to participate in the study. The Arabic version of the Maslach Burnout Inventory was distributed to respondents from July to October 2021.From the 300 resident physicians, 208 (69.3%) responded. The average age of the study population was 29.99 ± 3.01 years, with more than half were females (56.7%), single (59.6%), and with more than three years of residency experience (50.5%). In total, 86.1% met the criteria for burnout in at least one dimension and 13.9% in all three dimensions. On the dimension of emotional exhaustion (EE), 70.7% reported high levels of burnout. While, 44.2% reported high levels of depersonalization (DP), and 73.1% experienced a sense of decreased professional accomplishment (PA). There were significant differences in burnout, EE, and DP levels among different specialties, with the pediatrics-specialty trainees reported higher levels. Burnout syndrome was associated with the working hours per single duty; participants who reported working for more than 24 hours had experienced higher levels of burnout, EE, and DP.Large-scale studies are required to assess the determinants of burnout syndrome among resident physicians in Sudan. In addition, Stakeholders should urgently implement effective remedies to protect the mental health of resident physicians."
https://openalex.org/W4214840020,"Death registration in Uganda remains extremely low, yet mortality statistics are vital in health policy, planning, resource allocation and decision-making. According to NIRA, only 1% of deaths are registered annually, while Uganda Bureau of Statistics estimates death registration at 24% for the period 2011–2016. The wide variation between the administrative and survey statistics can be attributed to the restriction to only certified death registration by NIRA while survey statistics relate to all forms of death notification and registration at the different sub-national levels. Registration of deaths is of critical importance to individuals and a country’s government. Legally, it grants administrative rights in management of a deceased’s estate, and access to social (insurance and pension) benefits of a deceased person. It is also essential for official statistics and planning purposes. There is an urgent need for continuous and real-time collection of mortality data or statistics in Uganda. These statistics are of significance in public health for identifying the magnitude and distribution of major disease problems, and are essential for the design, implementation, monitoring, and assessment of health programmes and policies. Lack of such continuous and timely data has negative consequences for the achievement of both national and Sustainable Development Goals 3, 11, 16, and 17. This study assessed the determinants of death registration and certification, using a survey of 2018–2019 deaths in 2,100 households across four administrative regions of Uganda and Kampala district. Multivariate–binary logistic regression was used to model factors associated with the likelihood of a death being registered or certified. We find that around one-third of deaths were registered while death certificates were obtained for less than 5% of the total deaths. Death registration and certification varied notably within Uganda. Uptake of death registration and certification was associated with knowledge on death registration, region, access to mass media, age of the deceased, place of death, occupation of the deceased, relationship to household head and request for death certificate. There is need for decentralization of death registration services; massive sensitization of communities and creating demand for death registration."
https://openalex.org/W4214900406,"Despite the exquisite specificity and high affinity of antibody-based cancer therapies, treatment side effects can occur since the tumor-associated antigens targeted are also present on healthy cells. However, the low pH of the tumor microenvironment provides an opportunity to develop conditionally active antibodies with enhanced tumor specificity. Here, we engineered the human IgG1 Fc domain to enhance pH-selective binding to the receptor FcγRIIIa and subsequent antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). We displayed the Fc domain on the surface of mammalian cells and generated a site-directed library by altering Fc residues at the Fc-FcγRIIIa interface to support interactions with positively charged histidine residues. We then used a competitive staining and flow cytometric selection strategy to isolate Fc variants exhibiting reduced FcγRIIIa affinities at neutral pH, but physiological affinities at the tumor-typical pH 6.5. We demonstrate that antibodies composed of Fab arms binding the breast cell epithelial marker Her2 and the lead Fc variant, termed acid-Fc, exhibited an ∼2-fold pH-selectivity for FcγRIIIa binding based on the ratio of equilibrium dissociation constants Kd,7.4/Kd,6.5, due to a faster dissociation rate at pH 7.4. Finally, in vitro ADCC assays with human FcγRIIIa-positive natural killer and Her2-positive target cells demonstrated similar activities for anti-Her2 antibodies bearing the wild-type or acid-Fc at pH 6.5, but nearly 20-fold reduced ADCC for acid-Fc at pH 7.4, based on EC50 ratios. This work shows the promise of mammalian cell display for Fc engineering and the feasibility of pH-selective Fc activation to provide a second dimension of selective tumor cell targeting."
https://openalex.org/W4220765083,"Home-based physiotherapy interventions to improve post-stroke mobility are successful in high-income countries. These programs require less resources compared to center-based programs. However, feasibility of such an intervention in a low and middle-income setting remains unknown. Therefore, the SunRISe (Stroke Rehabilitation In Suriname) study aimed to assess feasibility and preliminary effectiveness of a home-based semi-supervised physiotherapy intervention to promote post-stroke mobility in a low resource setting.Prospective randomized controlled trial.Chronic stroke patients were recruited and randomized into either an intervention group (IG (N = 20)) or a control group (CG (N = 10)). The IG received a 3-days-a-week home-based physiotherapy program that was supervised in the first 4 weeks and tele-supervised during the second 4 weeks. The physiotherapy program consisted of walking as well as functional and mobilization exercises. The CG received usual care. Feasibility outcome measures included adherence, patient satisfaction and safety. Efficacy measures included functional exercise tolerance (six-minute walking test (6MWT), functional balance (Berg Balance Score (BBS), upper extremity (UE) function (Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) Questionnaire), and UE strength ((non-)paretic handgrip (HG) strength). Two-way analysis of variance was used for data analysis.Thirty participants (61.8 ± 9.2 years old, 13 men) were enrolled in the study. The intervention was completed by 14 participants (70%). Adherence was affected by rainy season associated infrastructural problems (n = 2), the medical status of participants (n = 3) and insufficient motivation to continue the program without direct supervision (n = 1). No adverse events were noted and participants were satisfied with the program. Functional exercise tolerance (57.2 ± 67.3m, p = 0.02) and UE function (-9.8 ± 15.2, p = 0.04) improved in the IG compared to no change in the CG. HG strength was unaltered and a ceiling effect occurred for BBS.Our home-based semi-supervised physiotherapy intervention seems safe, associated with moderate to high levels of engagement and patient satisfaction and results in functional improvements."

Therefore, search for new antibacterial agents has become a trend in several microbiological and pharmaceutical scientific works. Insects, one of the most successful and evolved species on earth is known to be an effective natural source of several medically useful chemicals including antibacterial agents. There is considerable evidence of using wasp venom against medical ailments in several parts of the world. In this work venom from Polistes wattii Cameron, 1900 collected from Eastern Province, Saudi Arabia was evaluated for its antibacterial activities. Such activity was tested against four pathogenic bacteria: two-gram positive Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 25923) and Streptococcus mutans (RCMB 017(1) ATCC 25175) and two gram-negative ( Salmonella typhimurium NCTC 12023 ATCC 14028 and Enterobacter cloacae (RCMB 001(1) ATCC 23355). Also, chemical characterization of wasp venom was done using HPLC and two isolated peptides were sequenced. The result indicates the potent anti-microbial effect of the venom against the four tested bacteria. The most sensitive bacteria were Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 25923) and Streptococcus mutans (RCMB 017(1) ATCC 25175). The sequence of the two purified peptides indicates that they belong to mastoparan.

In this study, we examine the increase of water mass in T cell during cell growth.

To study the origin of the water gain, we developed a novel methodology we call cold aqua trap-isotope ratio mass spectrometry, which allows analysis of the isotope composition of intracellular water. Applying cold aqua trap-isotope ratio mass spectrometry, we discovered that glycolysis-coupled metabolism of water accounts on average for 11 fl out of the 20 fl of water gained per cell during the initial slow phase. In addition, we show that at the end of the rapid phase before initiation of cell division, a water influx occurs, increasing the cellular water mass by threefold.

Our work provides a method to analyze cell water content as well as insights into the ways cells regulate their water mass. Cell growth requires cells to accumulate mass and to increase in physical size as a prerequisite step in development and proliferation (1Ginzberg M.B. Kafri R. Kirschner M.

However, how the gain of water mass is achieved, whether primarily because of metabolism or to the change in balance between influx and outflow from the external medium, remains unknown. This has been a challenging problem to study as establishing the source of additional water molecules in cells requires both the differentiation of the intracellular fraction from the background extracellular media and the tracing of the source of water molecules added to the cells. This is important because cellular water quantity affects intracellular chemistry as well as cell intracellular viscosity and mechanics. Previous attempts to understand the regulation of size, volume, and mass in living cells have focused on changes in total cellular mass. This is best assessed using an inertial picobalance. A recent study, in which single cells were weighed using a picobalance, revealed that the mass of cells rapidly fluctuates throughout the cell cycle. This study linked these mass fluctuations to the basic cellular processes and water transport (8Martínez-Martín D. Fläschner G. Gaub B. Martin S. Newton R. Beerli C. Mercer J. Gerber C. Müller D.J. Inertial picobalance reveals fast mass fluctuations in mammalian cells.Nature. 2017; 550: 500-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). However, although this study described a major leap in our ability to measure dry and water mass changes, it did not enable the direct delineation of cellular water regulation over time. Other efforts to understand cellular water hemostasis were successful in characterizing water uptake rates following osmotic shock (5Ho S.N. Intracellular water homeostasis and the mammalian cellular osmotic stress response.J. Cell Physiol. 2006; 206: 9-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Many of these studies used diverse optical methods to establish the dilution rate of the cytoplasm by water influx. Other studies attempted to investigate hydrodynamics at the millisecond level using Raman spectroscopy following acute deuterium exposure (9Ibata K. Takimoto S. Morisaku T. Miyawaki A. Yasui M. Analysis of aquaporin-mediated diffusional water permeability by coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering microscopy.Biophys. J. 2011; 101: 2277-2283Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Likewise, differences in density measurements were also used to extrapolate changes in water mass during cell growth (10Delgado F. Cermak F. Hecht N.C. Son V.C. Li S. Intracellular water exchange for measuring the dry mass, water mass and changes in chemical composition of living cells.PLoS One. 2013; 8: 67590Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). However, these indirect methodologies neither trace the source of cellular water mass gains nor directly quantify water influx rates under physiological conditions. Water isotope tracing and NMR were used to investigate organs and whole-body physiological responses in mammals (11Pivarnik J.M. Leeds E.M. Wilkerson J.E. Effects of endurance exercise on metabolic water production and plasma volume.J. Appl. Physiol. Respir. Environ. Exerc. Physiol. 1984; 56: 613-618PubMed Google Scholar, 12Schoeller D.A. Van Santen E. Measurement of energy expenditure in humans by doubly labeled water method.J. Appl. Physiol. Respir. Environ. Exerc.

Effect of temperature on water transport through aquaporins.Biologia Plantarum. 2010; 54: 488-494Crossref Scopus (38) Google Scholar) but not in the resolution required for analysis at the cellular level. Thus, a method to quantify in cells the correlation between volume changes and water mass gain as well as understanding the origin of water molecules gained during cell growth is lacking. In this study, we examined the gain of water molecules in growing T cells, as a model for water mass regulation during cell growth. We found that following activation stimuli, T-cell water mass increase occurred in two distinct phases, a slow phase and a fast phase. To establish the contribution of water influx and formation of metabolic water to each of the defined growth phases, we developed a novel method based on the intracellular water isotope composition, called cold aqua trap-isotope ratio mass spectrometry (CAT-IRMS). We then applied CAT-IRMS to establish the relative contribution of water influx versus metabolic water in each of the defined growth phases. We found that following stimuli, T cells switch between acquisition of metabolic water and increased water influx. During T-cell slow-growth phase, most water gains result from glycolysis and other metabolic reactions. On the other hand, at the end of the late fast-growth phase and in proximity to the initiation of cell division, we identified water influx as the predominant source of cellular water gain. We conclude that during activation, T cells switch from metabolic water–based slow growth to rapid influx–driven water mass increase. The ability to measure both the rate of water gain and the isotope composition of cells' water mass is an essential tool for the development of specific aquaporin (AQP) inhibitors as well as for the study of isotope fractionation phenomena in living cells. More importantly, it provides an approach toward a better understanding of the way in which cells determine what size to grow to before dividing. To study water mass incorporation in growing cells, we focused on the well-characterized in vitro T-cell activation model. Primary naïve T cells are among the smallest mammalian cells, reaching approximately 7 μm in diameter (14Tasnim H. Fricke G.M. Byrum J.R. Sotiris J.O. Cannon J.L. Moses M.E. Quantitative measurement of naïve T cell association with dendritic cells, FRCs, and blood vessels in lymph nodes.Front. Immunol. 2018; 9: 1571Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Stimulation of primary T cells leads to the initiation of a tightly coordinated and well-defined cell growth program leading to a significant increase in cell size (15Teague T.K. Munn L. Zygourakis K. McIntyre B.W. Analysis of lymphocyte activation and proliferation by video microscopy and digital imaging.Cytometry. 1993; 14: 772-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 16Chapman N.M. Chi H. Hallmarks of t-cell exit from quiescence.Cancer Immunol. Res. 2018; https://doi.org/10.1158/2326-6066.CIR-17-0605Crossref Scopus (31) Google Scholar). We examined the first 24 h after stimuli, as during this period, T cells go through rapid cell growth independent of cell division (17Lea N.C. Orr S.J. Stoeber K. Williams G.H. Lam E.W.-F. Ibrahim M.A.A. Mufti G.J. Thomas N.S.B. Commitment point during G0→G1 that controls entry into the cell cycle.Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 23: 2351-2361Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). To explore the dynamics of T-cell growth following stimuli, we activated primary T cells in vitro using a combination of anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 antibodies. T-cell size was approximated using flow cytometry at different time points after stimuli. Analysis of forward scatter signal suggested a two-phase growth dynamic; early slow-growth and late fast-growth phases (Fig. 1A). Forward scatter signal is a relative parameter and does not always correlate with cell size (18Koch L A. Robertson B.R. Button D.K. Deduction of the cell volume and mass from forward scatter intensity of bacteria analyzed by flow cytometry.J. Microbiol. Methods. 1996; 29: 49-61Crossref Scopus (66) Google Scholar).To reach a more robust volume measurement, stimulated T cells were analyzed using a flow cytometer capable of detecting cell electronic volume (EV) based on changes in impendence, in accordance with the Coulter principle. In line with the forward scatter signal, EV measurements demonstrated a two-phase growth dynamic. In the first slow-growth phase, the initial 12 h following stimuli, average volume per T cell increased from 174.3 to 228.3 fl, at a rate of ∼4.4 fl/h. During the late fast-growth phase, from 12 to 24 h after stimuli, average volume per T cell increased from 228.3 to 392.5 fl, at a faster rate of ∼14 fl/h (Fig. 1B). Primary T cells are a heterogeneous population composed of both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells that are intrinsically altered in their proliferative responses upon activation (19Foulds K.E. Zenewicz L.A. Shedlock D.J. Jiang J. Troy A.E. Shen H. Cutting edge: CD4 and CD8 T cells are intrinsically different in their proliferative responses.J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 1528-1532Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). CD8+ T cells are tuned for rapid and extensive proliferation to support their role as cytotoxic cells, whereas CD4+ T cells undergo slow and limited division to support cytokine secretion and immune regulation (19Foulds K.E. Zenewicz L.A. Shedlock D.J. Jiang J. Troy A.E. Shen H. Cutting edge: CD4 and CD8 T cells are intrinsically different in their proliferative responses.J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 1528-1532Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). These marked differences in function may translate to variation in the pattern and/or the magnitude of growth. We therefore decided to investigate the growth rate of CD8+ and CD4+ T cells separately. Stimulated CD4+ or CD8+ T cells were analyzed using EV flow cytometry. Both T-cell types substantially accelerated cell growth at the late phase between 12 and 24 h after stimuli. Notably, CD8+ T cells accelerated their growth to a larger extent at 12 h compared with CD4+ T cells. During the late growth phase, the average CD8+ T cell increased by ∼19.8 fl per hour in comparison to ∼12.5 fl/h for the average CD4+ T cell (Fig. 1, C and D). Together, these results demonstrate that CD8+ and CD4+ T cells differ in their magnitude of growth. However, they share similar growth patterns by which at 12 h following stimuli, they switch from a slow-growth to a fast-growth program. T-cell volume is the sum of both dry and water mass. To directly quantify the differences in T-cell water mass during activation, we modified a Karl Fischer titration-based protocol used in liposome content analysis (20Cohen R. Kanaan H. Grant G.J. Barenholz Y. Prolonged analgesia from Bupisome and Bupigel formulations: From design and fabrication to improved stability.J. Controlled Release. 2012; 160: 346-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). We reasoned that we will be able to quantify intracellular water by carefully clearing T-cell pellets from surrounding water. To initially measure the gross water volume in cell samples, T-cell pellets were carefully cleared from trace water and resuspended in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) (Fig. 2, A and B). We then used an adjusted Karl Fischer coulometric titration protocol to quantify the water mass in the different samples as well as in DMSO blanks (Fig. 2C). To derive the gross water mass, the average DMSO signal (blank) was deducted from each sample (Table S1; Equation 1). Finally, to convert the mass to volume, we multiplied the water mass obtained with the water density coefficient, ∼1.0 (Table S1; Equation 2). We next attempted to identify the background signal resulting from extracellular water molecules. T cells were suspended in media containing the cell-impermeable inulin carboxyl (carboxyl-14C) (Fig. 2D). Cell pellets were then carefully cleared from trace water and resuspended in PBS (Fig. 2E). To calculate the extracellular background level, we measured the beta radiation emitted from the PBS used to resuspend the cells (trace) with respect to the one from the original inulin carboxyl (carboxyl-14C)–based media (source) (Figs. 2F and S1A). To control for other possible background signal sources, we repeated the procedure with empty tubes and also measured the signal from untreated cell samples (Fig. S1B). Using these measurements, we could derive the indirect average extracellular water background level per sample by multiplying the dilution factor (mCi trace/mCi source) by the volume of the source sample (Fig. S1C and Table S1; Equation 3). By combining the background volume quantification with the growth volume measurements and accounting for the number of cells in the sample, we were able to derive the average wet volume per cell in the sample (Table S1; Equations 4 and 5). We then applied this protocol (Fig. 2, A–F) to quantify the intracellular water mass fraction at several time points during the course of T-cell activation. Our measurements indicated that on average, naïve T cells contain ∼111 fl water per cell. Following stimuli, T-cell absolute volume increased to 125, 258, and 380 fl at 12, 16, and 24 h, respectively (Fig. 2G). Importantly, T-cell relative wet volume decreased at the slow-growth phase from ∼60% to ∼55% of total volume. In contrast, in the fast phase, the rapid increase in cell wet volume translated to an increase to over 95% water in respect to total cell volume (Figs. 2H and S1D). Thus, slow-growth phase of the T cells is associated with a relative decrease in cellular water quantity, whereas fast-growth phase of the T cells is associated with a substantial increase in relative wet volume. These findings suggest that the two well-defined T-cell growth phases are underlined by different water mass acquisition mechanisms. To identify the source of water gained by T cells during each growth phase, we developed a strategy for intracellular water tracing. Inspired by water tracing studies in plants and bacterial cells (21Kreuzer-Martin H.W. Ehleringer J.R. Hegg E.L. Oxygen isotopes indicate most intracellular water in log-phase Escherichia coli is derived from metabolism.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 17337-17341Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 22Walker G. Brunel J.-P. Dighton J. Holland K. Leaney F. McEwan K. Mensforth L. Thorburn P. Walker C. The use of stable isotopes of water for determining sources of water for plant transpiration.Stable Isotope Techniques in the Study of Biological Processes and Functioning of Ecosystems. Current Plant Science and Biotechnology in Agriculture. 40. Springer, Cham2001Crossref Google Scholar), we designed a three-step protocol for measuring both water influx into cells as well as de novo metabolic water. We thought that by exposing cells for short periods to labeled media; trapping the intracellular fraction by low temperature; and analyzing the isotope ratios in the trapped media, we could detect the cellular water isotope composition and derive both the source of and the rate of water gained by the cells (Fig. S2, A–F). We named this method CAT-IRMS. To trace the entry of extracellular water to the cytoplasm, we chose to treat the cells with water labeled with heavy oxygen isotope (H218O)-based medium (Fig. S2A). Alternative markers such as deuterium and tritium may diffuse from the labeled solute to various other molecules via proton hopping (23de Grotthuss C.J.T. Memoir on the decomposition of water and of the bodies that it holds in solution by means of galvanic electricity.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbabio.2006.07.004Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Likewise, deuterium-based medium was shown to be toxic to key eukaryotic cellular process including the function of ATP synthase (24Olgun A. Biological effects of deuteronation: ATP synthase as an example.Theor. Biol. Med. Model. 2007; 4: 9Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 25Nelson S.D. Trager W.F. The use of deuterium isotope effects to probe the active site properties, mechanism of cytochrome P450-catalyzed reactions, and mechanisms of metabolically dependent toxicity.Drug Metab. Disposition. 2003; 31: 1481-1498Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). In contrast, H218O-based labeled medium is inert and remains stable in diverse temperatures (26Easteal A.J. Edge A.V.J. Woolf L.A. Isotope effects in water. Tracer diffusion coefficients for H218O in ordinary water.J. Phys. Chem. 1984; https://doi.org/10.1021/j150668a065Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar). A major challenge in isolating the isotope composition of cellular water mass is to separate the intracellular fraction from the extracellular H218O-based treatment media. We reasoned that by rapidly cooling cells to a temperature above freezing, we would be able to trap the aqueous content of cells. This is expected because of the thermodynamic effect of low temperature on the rate of osmosis across the cell membrane. Importantly, because water molecules in eukaryotic cells are locked in a tight sponge-like filament network, the reduction in energy mediated by cooling is expected to cage intracellular water molecules independent of membrane permeability (27Sachs F. Sivaselvan M.V. Cell volume control in three dimensions: Water movement without solute movement.J. Gen. Physiol. 2015; 145: 373-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Thus, by cooling the cells, the isotopic composition of intracellular water could then be used to derive both the source and the rate by which cells gained water mass (Fig. S2B). To release the trapped intracellular water mass for isotope analysis, a measured volume of double-distilled water was added followed by several freeze–thaw cycles and a sonication protocol (Fig. S2C). Several control samples were collected and analyzed in parallel to cell samples to account for possible system noise. These included a sample from the labeled media following the treatment (treatment samples) for H218O concentration measurement; a sample from the last cold wash media (background) to account for leaks and extracellular contaminants; a sample from the double-distilled water media used to lyse the cells as a baseline. Cell lysate (samples), as well as the specified control samples, was then sent for IRMS analysis (Fig. S2, D–F). Since IRMS is fed with gas, a stoichiotransfer was conducted by exposing the samples in close tubes to a gas mixture containing 99.4% helium and 0.6% carbon dioxide for 48 h at room temperature (Fig. S2D). This allows enough time for the oxygen in the carbon dioxide gas to equilibrate with the oxygen in the water. The gas samples containing the oxygen isotope signature were then measured by IRMS (Fig. S2E). To assess the minimum sample volume required for stoichiotransfer, we analyzed gas extracts following 48 h of exposure to decreasing volumes of premeasured H2O TW17 isotope standard. Notably, samples greater than 100 μl produced results consistent with the standard, suggesting that volumes ≥100 μl are suitable for stoichiotransfer (Fig. S3A). IRMS-derived ratios from the different samples were standardized in respect to the Standard Mean Ocean Water isotope ratio (Fig. S2F). The measurement of the 18O/160 ratio, expressed as δ18O for water samples, was made following the CO2 equilibration method (28Goldsmith Y. Polissar P.J. Ayalon A. Bar-Matthews M. deMenocal P.B.

Hydrol. 1998; 207: 18-31Crossref Scopus (156) Google Scholar). The results from the standardized IRMS measurements could then be used to derive the total volume of cellular H218O in fL and the flux rate, H218O∗min−1 (Table S1; Equations 6–9). To test the robustness and accuracy of CAT-IRMS, we applied our methodology to a number of cell types under diverse conditions. We next examined the influence of H218O concentration on the signal level received from cell samples. To assess the limit of detection, Hep2G cells were incubated in media containing 1%, 5%, and 50% H218O and then analyzed via CAT-IRMS (Fig. 3A). Background measurements from the final cell wash were all comparable to the source PBS signal level and 5 permil lower than the sample signal of the cells incubated in 1% H218O-enriched media (Figs. 3B and S3B). In contrast to background measurements, cell sample measurements produced strong signals, in proportion to the H218O concentrations in the incubation media (Figs. 3B and S3C). To relate our results to cell number and incubation time, measurements were converted and averaged to H218O volume in fL per cell (Fig. 3C) and as flux per minute (Fig. 3D). Under physiological conditions, the accumulation of H218O signal in resting cells is anticipated as both growing and quiescent cells are subject to rapid fluctuation in cell density (8Martínez-Martín D. Fläschner G. Gaub B. Martin S. Newton R. Beerli C. Mercer J. Gerber C. Müller D.J. Inertial picobalance reveals fast mass fluctuations in mammalian cells.Nature. 2017; 550: 500-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Because of the concentration of H218O, the probability of labeled water to enter the cell is higher than the probability of outflow, so resting cells are expected to accumulate a signal. To assess the effect of incubation time on the H218O signal, Hep2G cells were cultured in media containing 10% H218O for 10 or 30 min and analyzed for oxygen isotope composition using CAT-IRMS. As expected, cell samples incubated for 30 min had a substantially higher H218O signal in comparison to cell samples incubated for 10 min (Figs. 3, F and G and S3D). To examine the relevance of CAT-IRMS to primary cells and the effect of temperature on water flux, mouse peritoneal macrophages were cultured in PBS containing 50% H218O for 10 min at different temperatures. In line with previous reports (13Ionenko I.F. Anisimov A.V. Dautova N.R.

Importantly, the reduction in the signal under low temperature indicates that the potential signal lost during the cold wash cycles step in CAT-IRMS is negligible. To evaluate whether our method can detect alterations in water flux across cell membranes, we measured H218O accumulation in cells under AQP inhibition or hypertonic conditions. For this purpose, mouse peritoneal macrophages were incubated in media containing 50% H218O, with or without mercury (II) chloride, an inhibitor of several AQPs (32Abir-Awan M. Kitchen P. Salman M.M.

Grubmüller H. Water permeation across biological membranes: Mechanism and dynamics of aquaporin-1 and GlpF.Science. 2001; 294: 2353-2357Crossref PubMed Scopus (797) Google Scholar). As expected, CAT-IRMS analysis of samples treated with both mercury (II) chloride and glycerol showed a strong reduction in H218O signal in respect to untreated cells (Figs. 3J and S3F). Collectively, our measurements indicate that CAT-IRMS is a robust and an accurate method, appropriate for analysis and tracing of cellular water flux, synthesis, source, and efficiency of AQP inhibitors. The sponge model suggests that in eukaryote cells with dense cytoskeleton, the regulation of intracellular water is not a simple function of extracellular media tonicity (7Platonova A. Ponomarchuk O.

Physiol. 2015; 145: 373-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). We therefore examined how changes in media tonicity affect naïve and activated T-cell volume in respect to red blood cells (RBCs). Incubation of RBCs and resting naïve T cells in hypotonic media led to a significant inflation in cell volume (Fig. 4, A and B). In contrast, T cells activated in hypotonic media for 12, 16, and 24 h did not demonstrate a significant increase in volume with respect to cells in normal media (Fig. 4C). These results suggest that as opposed to quiescent naïve T cells and RBCs, activated T cells may have the capacity to maintain regulated volume decrease (35Hoffmann E.K. Pedersen S.F. Cell volume homeostatic mechanisms: Effectors and signalling pathways.Acta Physiol. 2011; 202: 465-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) over time. This alteration can be attributed to augmented metabolism and/or cytoskeleton reprogramming upheld by activated T cells that can serve as compensatory mechanisms for the influx of water over time. Overall, these findings indicate that cellular water mass growth reflects a tightly regulated water flux mechanism, linked to membrane permeability, ion transport, the ability of the cytoplasm to absorb water, and biogenesis of de novo water mole"

Despite this, the effect of social factors, personality traits and cross-interaction on professional quality of life is still unclear.To reveal the association between ethical climate, personal trait and professional quality of life.An online survey of registered nurses working in adult, pediatric or both ICUs. We used the ten-item personality measure based on The Big Five theory and Type-D personality Scale-14 then measured the ethical climate with the Hospital Ethical Climate Survey and the professional domains of burnout syndrome, secondary traumatic stress and compassion satisfaction by the Professional Quality of Life Scale Version 5 simultaneously. Multivariate analysis confirmed the triangular association of hospital ethical climate, personality traits and professional quality of life.We enrolled 310 participants from September 2019 to February 2020. Mean age was 33.1 years (± 5.9) and about 70% were female. In the multivariate analysis, neuroticism (p = 0.03, p = 0.01) and Type D personality (both of p<0.01) were associated with burnout syndrome and secondary traumatic stress while agreeableness (p<0.01) was associated with secondary traumatic stress. Conversely, extraversion (p = 0.01), agreeableness (p<0.01) and openness (p<0.01) were associated with compassion satisfaction. We also observed interactions between hospital ethical climate and conscientiousness (p = 0.01) for burnout syndrome and secondary traumatic stress. Neuroticism was related to (p<0.01) BOS and compassion satisfaction while Type D personality (p<0.01) correlated with burnout syndrome and secondary traumatic stress.Hospital ethical climate strongly affects professional quality of life in nurses with specific personality traits. Therefore, it is important to maintain an ethical hospital climate, considering individual personalities to prevent burnout syndrome."
https://openalex.org/W4214818487,"This work reports substrate-selective inhibition of a protease with broad substrate specificity based on direct binding of a small-molecule inhibitor to the substrate. The target for these studies was γ-secretase protease, which cleaves dozens of different single-span membrane protein substrates, including both the C99 domain of the human amyloid precursor protein and the Notch receptor. Substrate-specific inhibition of C99 cleavage is desirable to reduce production of the amyloid-β polypeptide without inhibiting Notch cleavage, a major source of toxicity associated with broad specificity γ-secretase inhibitors. In order to identify a C99-selective inhibitors of the human γ-secretase, we conducted an NMR-based screen of FDA-approved drugs against C99 in model membranes. From this screen, we identified the small-molecule verteporfin with these properties. We observed that verteporfin formed a direct 1:1 complex with C99, with a KD of 15–47 μM (depending on the membrane mimetic used), and that it did not bind the transmembrane domain of the Notch-1 receptor. Biochemical assays showed that direct binding of verteporfin to C99 inhibits γ-secretase cleavage of C99 with IC50 values in the range of 15–164 μM, while Notch-1 cleavage was inhibited only at higher concentrations, and likely via a mechanism that does not involve binding to Notch-1.

Historically, these associations between genetics and AD have been thought to be the consequences of toxic oligomer and amyloid fibril formation by Aβ polypeptides released after successive proteolysis of APP by the β- and γ-secretase proteases (Fig. 1A) (7Hardy J.

However, previous clinical trials of inhibitors of γ-secretase have failed, in large part due to toxicity associated with lack of substrate-specific inhibition of γ-secretase, which has many dozens of substrates (15Beel A.J.

Particularly notable is toxicity resulting from inhibition of Notch-1 cleavage, which disrupts essential signaling from this receptor (17Ryeom S.W.

In this paper, we describe our efforts to find compounds that act as substrate-selective γ-secretase inhibitors. Specifically, we sought to discover compounds that inhibit cleavage of C99—the product of APP cleavage by β-secretase and the immediate precursor of Aβ, while at the same time allowing Notch cleavage by γ-secretase to proceed uninhibited. In addition to their potential utility in reducing Aβ production, compounds that inhibit C99 cleavage would be valuable tool compounds for studying C99 biology.

Studies such as these motivated this study to further explore this substrate-directed inhibitory approach. Here, we report the results of our search for compounds that act by specifically binding to the C99 substrate rather than by targeting the protease itself. We describe the discovery that the porphyrin-based drug verteporfin directly binds C99 in model membranes to form a 1:1 complex with a KD of ca. 17 μM. Moreover, verteporfin inhibits γ-secretase cleavage of C99 at concentrations where it does not inhibit Notch cleavage. We previously determined the 3D structure of monodisperse C99 in model membranes using solution nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy (PDB: 2LP1) (38Barrett P.J. Song Y. Van Horn W.D.

We therefore set out to screen a library of 1184 FDA-approved drugs using NMR to detect C99-binders and then to exhaustively validate binding and to determine the binding affinity, as outlined in Figure 1. Before initiation of the screen, various NMR conditions such as the C99 protein concentration, detergent concentration, tolerable concentration of DMSO (vehicle), and NMR pulse programs/parameters were explored. While several conditions produced high-quality NMR spectra, we settled on screening conditions consisting of 50 μM C99 in 2.5% w/v (52 mM) lyso-myristoylphosphtidylglycerol (LMPG) micelles at pH 6.5, with NMR spectra being acquired using the BEST-TROSY pulse sequence (42Farjon J. Boisbouvier J. Schanda P. Pardi A. Simorre J.P. Brutscher B. Longitudinal-relaxation-enhanced NMR experiments for the study of nucleic acids in solution.J. Am. Chem.

Van Horn W.D. Hustedt E.J. Schafer J.M. Hadziselimovic A. Beel A.J. Sanders C.R. The amyloid precursor protein has a flexible transmembrane domain and binds cholesterol.Science. 2012; 336: 1168-1171Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). Nearly all C99 resonances exhibited satisfactory signal-to-noise even at 50 μM protein concentration and using a short data acquisition time (35 min, Fig. 2A). This approach enabled the screening of all 1184 samples in 36 days with the assistance of a Bruker SampleJet automated sample changer. Using the optimized conditions described above, we completed a screen of the available SelleckChemical library of FDA-approved drugs. We identified 20 compounds as potential hits based on the observation that 50 μM concentrations of these compounds perturbed the resonances of 50 μM C99 (Fig. S1). Of these 20 compounds, only verteporfin yielded results that stood out when C99 was subjected to a titration by each compound. Specifically, only verteporfin led to changes in the positions of C99 peaks during titration that were seen to saturate at submillimolar concentrations. Chemical shift perturbations were observed in TROSY amide backbone NH resonances from multiple C99 peaks, most arising from sites in and around the transmembrane domain and amphipathic C-helix (Fig. 2, A and B). For experiments in LMPG micelles, fits of the 1:1 binding model to the titration traces from multiple different peaks (Fig. 2C) led to determination of an average dissociation constant (KD) of 17 ± 11 μM across multiple residues in and around the TM domain. The presence of both fast and slow-exchanging resonances is consistent with the determined micromolar KD value. Peaks that undergo large changes in resonance frequency upon complex formation fall in the slow exchange regime, where both complexed and free protein peaks are directly observed. Peaks that undergo smaller changes in frequency upon complex formation were in the fast exchange regime, where only a single peak is observed at a population-weighted average frequency between the free and fully complexed peak frequency limits. We have previously used NMR to characterize the structure of the Notch-1 transmembrane domain flanked by its juxtamembrane segments (residues 1721–1771, “Notch-1 TM/JM”) (44Deatherage C.L. Lu Z. Kroncke B.M. Ma S. Smith J.A. Voehler M.W. McFeeters R.L. Sanders C.R. Structural and biochemical differences between the Notch and the amyloid precursor protein transmembrane domains.Sci. Adv. 2017; 3e1602794Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Titration of Notch-1 TM/JM by verteporfin in LMPG micelles under the same conditions as used for the titration of C99 revealed only minor perturbations of Notch resonances in response to increasing levels of verteporfin (Fig. 2D). That there are minor verteporfin-induced shifts that are small and much less extensively be seen than for C99 is not surprising in light of data shown below that verteporfin does bind nonspecifically to micelles. Overall, these NMR titration results indicate that verteporfin binds C99 but not Notch-1. To confirm that binding of verteporfin to C99 is not highly dependent on the nature of the membrane mimetic in which C99 is solubilized, we repeated TROSY-monitored titrations of C99 in two model membrane systems that differ in important ways from anionic LMPG micelles (1Castro M.A. Hadziselimovic A. Sanders C.R. The vexing complexity of the amyloidogenic pathway.Protein Sci. 2019; 28: 1177-1193Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar): zwitterionic bicelles composed of 3:1 (mol:mol, q = 0.33) dihexanoylphosphatidylcholine (D6PC):dimyristoylphosphotidylcholine (DMPC) and (2Zheng H. Koo E.H. Biology and pathophysiology of the amyloid precursor protein.Mol. Neurodegener. 2011; 6: 27Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar) nonionic beta-dodecylmelibiose (DDMB) micelles. NMR titration of C99 in D6PC-DMPC bicelles by verteporfin revealed both fast- and slow-exchange perturbations, similar to what was observed in LMPG (Fig. 3A). The perturbed residues (regardless of NMR exchange regime) mainly mapped to the transmembrane and amphipathic C-helix residues (Fig. 3B). Fitting of two of the titration curves revealed KD of 17 ± 4 μM and KD of 16 ± 4 μM, corroborating well with what was seen in LMPG micelles (Fig. 3C). A corresponding titration of the Notch-1 juxtamembrane/transmembrane domain in micelles by verteporfin again revealed only minor spectral changes at very high concentrations that are much less extensive than seen for C99 and likely arise from affects related to nonspecific binding of verteporfin to the protein-containing micelles and bicelles (Fig. 3D). Verteporfin titration of C99 in nonionic DDMB micelles confirmed binding in this medium as well, with fitting of the data for two different peaks yielding KD of 43 ± 17 μM and 47 ± 22 μM, slightly weaker than seen for LMPG micelles and DHPC-DMPC bicelles (Fig. S2, A–C). Again, the peaks that shifted were mostly located in the transmembrane domain and amphipathic C-helix. Verteporfin titration of Notch-1 in DDMB revealed little change in the spectrum of Notch-1 until a concentration of 300 μM (Fig. S2D), consistent with interactions between Verteporfin and Notch-1 that are only very weak and/or nonspecific. The DHPC-DMPC bicelle and DDMB micelle results corroborate the LMPG micelle results to show that verteporfin binds C99 in a wide range of membrane-like conditions and that the affinity exhibits only modest variation (KD in the range of 15–47 μM) across multiple different classes of model membranes. We tested to see if verteporfin interacts with LMPG micelles in the absence of protein to investigate the possibility that verteporfin interactions with C99 might be modulated by the intrinsic affinity of verteporfin for membranes. We therefore titrated empty LMPG micelles with verteporfin, as monitored by examining the 1-D 1H NMR spectra of LMPG as a function of verteporfin concentration. Concentration-dependent changes in the position of the LMPG acyl chain methylene peak envelope revealed that their resonance frequencies were shifted by increasing verteporfin concentrations (Fig. 4A). A fit of the one verteporfin binding to one detergent micelle binding model to these changes yielded a reasonably good fit and a KD of 53 ± 21 μM (Fig. 4B). Dynamic light scattering (DLS) measurements revealed that verteporfin had only modest effects on micelle particle size over a range of concentrations from 0 to 200 μM (Fig. 4C). We also carried out a reciprocal titration in which the 1H NMR resonances from constant 100 μM verteporfin resonances were monitored as LMPG was titrated up through and far beyond its critical micelle concentration (CMC), which is ca. 0.2 to 0.5 mM at neutral pH values (45Stafford R.E. Fanni T. Dennis E.A. Interfacial properties and critical micelle concentration of lysophospholipids.Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 5113-5120Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Verteporfin resonances were very broad at LMPG concentrations below CMC (Fig. 4D), indicating aggregate formation by verteporfin in micelle-free aqueous solutions. Above CMC the quality of its spectrum increased gradually as the LMPG concentration was increased to 10 mM, suggesting dispersal of the constant population of verteporfin from interacting with a small number of micelles at LMPG concentrations near the CMC to interactions at higher LMPG levels in which each micelle has fewer associated verteporfin molecules (Fig. 4E). DLS measurements further illuminate that even in the mixture of 10 mM LMPG and 100 μM verteporfin, there is a persistence of large verteporfin aggregates, which are fully dissolved only near the point at which the LMPG concentration approaches that present in NMR screening conditions (50 mM) (Fig. 4F). This indicates that micelle formation is required to disperse the verteporfin aggregates and that the concentration of the micelles needs to be high enough to ensure that multiple molecules of verteporfin do not interact with same micelle. Taken together, our results indicate that verteporfin binds to LMPG micelles, which suppresses verteporfin aggregation at higher micelle concentrations. The results also indicate that verteporfin does not significantly alter the size or structure of the micelles with which it associates, provided that there are a sufficient number of micelles present. We conclude that verteporfin’s membrane affinity helps bring this compound in contact with C99 by solubilizing the drug and by providing the model membrane environment in which these two molecules can encounter each other. However, it is notable that under identical conditions, Notch-1 in LMPG micelles does not exhibit interactions with verteporfin, indicating that micelle binding by verteporfin alone is not the determinant of C99–verteporfin interaction. To verify that that complex formation between verteporfin and C99 truly involves direct intermolecular contact, we recorded a 2D 1H,1H-NOESY spectrum for a 1:1 mixture of verteporfin and C99 in 2.5% d27-LMPG (deuterated acyl chains) micelles to see if cross-peaks can be observed between well-resolved verteporfin and C99 resonances. Fig. S3 documents the unambiguous presence of at least two such cross-peaks, which confirms direct binding of verteporfin to C99. Other verteporfin-C99 cross-peaks were also likel"

However, the Chinese version has not been similarly revised. The aim of this study was to develop and examine the psychometric properties of the Chinese BREQ-3 using alternative structural equation models. Specifically, this study aimed to translate the English BREQ-3 into Chinese to examine the best representation of the factor configuration of Chinese BREQ-3, measurement invariance for the best-fitted model, and the concurrent validity evidence and reliability for the Chinese BREQ-3. Undergraduate students (N = 825) from mainland China completed a battery of online questionnaires. After including two general motivation factors (controlled motivation and autonomous motivation), we discovered that the majority of items on the identified regulation, integrated regulation, and intrinsic motivation subscales no longer loaded on or had very low loadings on their specific factors, implying that these items essentially represent a unidimensional construct. Invariance testing supported the comparison between latent factor means across gender based on the bi-factor exploratory structural equation model (BESEM). Concurrent validity evidence was found for amotivation, controlled motivation, and autonomous motivation. The hierarchical omega, explained common variance (ECV), item explained common variance (I_ECV), and percentage of uncontaminated correlations (PUC) indicated that the external regulation and introjected regulation subscales had a multidimensional structure, while the identified regulation, integrated regulation, and intrinsic motivation subscales had a unidimensional structure (autonomous motivation). We advocate calculating amotivation, external regulation, introjected regulation, and a single autonomous motivation (excluding item 19) score when utilizing the Chinese BREQ-3."

It causes significant crop losses worldwide and also in Pakistan. BBTV is present in Pakistan since 1988 however, till now only few (about twenty only) sequence of genomic components have been reported from the country. To have insights into current genetic diversity in Pakistan fifty-seven genomic components including five complete genomes (comprises of DNA-R, -U3, -S, -M, -C and -N components) were sequenced in this study. The genetic diversity analysis of populations from Pakistan showed that DNA-R is highly conserved followed by DNA-N, whereas DNA-U3 is highly diverse with the most diverse Common Region Stem-loop (CR-SL) in BBTV genome, a functional region, which previously been reported to have undergone recombination in Pakistani population. A Maximum Likelihood (ML) phylogenetic analysis of entire genomes of isolates by using sequence of all the components concatenated together with the reported genomes around the world revealed deeper insights about the origin of the disease in Pakistan. A comparison of the genetic diversity of Pakistani and entire BBTV populations around the world indicates that there exists a correlation between genetic diversity and recombination. Population genetics analysis indicated that the degree of selection pressure differs depending on the area and genomic component. A detailed analysis of recombination across various components and functional regions suggested that recombination is closely associated with the functional parts of BBTV genome showing high genetic diversity. Both genetic diversity and recombination analyses suggest that the CR-SL is a recombination hotspot in all BBTV genomes and among the six components DNA-U3 is the only recombined component that has extensively undergone inter and intragenomic recombination. Diversity analysis of recombinant regions results on average one and half fold increase and, in some cases up to four-fold increase due to recombination. These results suggest that recombination is significantly contributing to the genetic diversity of BBTV populations around the world."

Type 2 diabetes was diagnosed in 2.8% and 21.6% had persistent dysglycaemia at 6-13 weeks post-delivery. Those who did not attend postpartum glucose test seem to be younger, multiparous, obese, and continued to smoke during pregnancy. They also had higher fasting glucose at antenatal oral glucose tolerance test. Our machine learning algorithm predicted postpartum glucose non-attendance with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.72. The model could achieve a sensitivity of 70% with 66% specificity at a risk score threshold of 0.46. A total of 233 (38.4%) women attended subsequent glucose test at least once within the first two years of delivery and 24% had dysglycaemia. Compared to women who attended postpartum glucose test, those who did not attend had higher conversion rate to type 2 diabetes (2.5% vs 11.4%; p = 0.005).Postpartum screening following GDM is still poor. Women who did not attend postpartum screening appear to have higher metabolic risk and higher conversion to type 2 diabetes by two years post-delivery. Machine learning model can predict women who are unlikely to attend postpartum glucose test using simple antenatal factors. Enhanced, personalised education of these women may improve postpartum glucose screening."
https://openalex.org/W4220938751,"The main active metabolite of Vitamin A, all-trans retinoic acid (RA), is required for proper cellular function and tissue organization. Heart development has a well-defined requirement for RA, but there is limited research on the role of RA in the adult heart. Homeostasis of RA includes regulation of membrane receptors, chaperones, enzymes, and nuclear receptors. Cellular retinol-binding protein, type 1 (CRBP1), encoded by retinol-binding protein, type 1 (Rbp1), regulates RA homeostasis by delivering vitamin A to enzymes for RA synthesis and protecting it from non-specific oxidation. In this work, a multi-omics approach was used to characterize the effect of CRBP1 loss using the Rbp1−/− mouse. Retinoid homeostasis was disrupted in Rbp1−/− mouse heart tissue, as seen by a 33% and 24% decrease in RA levels in the left and right ventricles, respectively, compared to wild-type mice (WT). To further inform on the effect of disrupted RA homeostasis, we conducted high-throughput targeted metabolomics. A total of 222 metabolite and metabolite combinations were analyzed, with 33 having differential abundance between Rbp1−/− and WT hearts. Additionally, we performed global proteome profiling to further characterize the impact of CRBP1 loss in adult mouse hearts. More than 2606 unique proteins were identified, with 340 proteins having differential expression between Rbp1−/− and WT hearts. Pathway analysis performed on metabolomic and proteomic data revealed pathways related to cellular metabolism and cardiac metabolism were the most disrupted in Rbp1−/− mice. Together, these studies characterize the effect of CRBP1 loss and reduced RA in the adult heart."

(2020). The physical properties of the modified asphalt were measured via a basic index test, and the dynamic rheological behavior of the modified asphalt was characterized by a dynamic shear rheometer (DSR), a bending beam rheometer (BBR), and other technical means. Moreover, double-beam UV-visible (UV-Vis) spectrophotometry and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) were conducted to determine the mechanism of asphalt modification from the microscopic perspective. The experimental results reveal that the GO content can improve the basic mechanical properties, high-temperature stability, and low-temperature cracking resistance of TPU/SBS-modified asphalt. When the GO content is 0.5%, the ductility and softening point of the modified asphalt are found to be significantly increased, and the degree of penetration is slightly decreased. Moreover, with the increase of the GO content, the rutting resistance and crack resistance of the asphalt materials are improved. Via the joint action of physical modification and chemical reaction, GO can form a stable structure with asphalt molecules, enhance the stability between asphalt molecules, and increase the colloidal content of macromolecules in the modified asphalt components."
https://openalex.org/W4221083688,"Synchronized transcription elongation complexes (TECs) are a fundamental tool for in vitro studies of transcription and RNA folding. Transcription elongation can be synchronized by omitting one or more nucleoside triphosphates from an in vitro transcription reaction so that RNA polymerase can only transcribe to the first occurrence of the omitted nucleotide(s) in the coding DNA strand. This approach was developed over four decades ago and has been applied extensively in biochemical investigations of RNA polymerase enzymes but has not been optimized for RNA-centric assays. In this work, we describe the development of a system for isolating synchronized TECs from an in vitro transcription reaction. Our approach uses a custom 5' leader sequence, called capture sequence 3-structure cassette 1 (C3-SC1), to reversibly capture synchronized TECs on magnetic beads. We first show, using electrophoretic mobility shift and high-resolution in vitro transcription assays, that complexes isolated by this procedure, called C3-SC1TECs, are >95% pure, >98% active, highly synchronous (94% of complexes chase in <15s upon addition of saturating nucleoside triphosphates), and compatible with solid-phase transcription; the yield of this purification is ∼8%. We then show that C3-SC1TECs perturb, but do not interfere with, the function of ZTP (5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide riboside 5'-triphosphate)-sensing and ppGpp (guanosine-3',5'-bisdiphosphate)-sensing transcriptional riboswitches. For both riboswitches, transcription using C3-SC1TECs improved the efficiency of transcription termination in the absence of ligand but did not inhibit ligand-induced transcription antitermination. Given these properties, C3-SC1TECs will likely be useful for developing biochemical and biophysical RNA assays that require high-performance, quantitative bacterial in vitro transcription."
https://openalex.org/W4214850890,"Crumbs proteins are evolutionarily conserved transmembrane proteins with essential roles in promoting the formation of the apical domain in epithelial cells. The short intracellular tail of Crumbs proteins are known to interact with several proteins, including the scaffolding protein PALS1 (protein associated with LIN7, Stardust in Drosophila). PALS1 in turn binds to a second scaffolding protein PATJ (PALS1-associated tight junction protein) to form the core Crumbs/PALS1/PATJ complex. While essential roles in epithelial organization have been shown for Crumbs proteins in Drosophila and mammalian systems, the three Caenorhabditis elegans crumbs genes are dispensable for epithelial polarization and development. Here, we investigated the presence and function of PALS1 and PATJ orthologs in C. elegans. We identified MAGU-2 as the C. elegans ortholog of PALS1 and show that MAGU-2 interacts with all three Crumbs proteins and localizes to the apical membrane domain of intestinal epithelial cells in a Crumbs-dependent fashion. Similar to crumbs mutants, magu-2 deletion showed no epithelial polarity defects. We also identified MPZ-1 as a candidate ortholog of PATJ based on the physical interaction with MAGU-2 and sequence similarity with PATJ proteins. However, MPZ-1 is not broadly expressed in epithelial tissues and, therefore, not likely a core component of the C. elegans Crumbs complex. Finally, we show overexpression of the Crumbs proteins EAT-20 or CRB-3 can lead to apical membrane expansion in the intestine. Our results shed light on the composition of the C. elegans Crumbs complex and indicate that the role of Crumbs proteins in promoting apical domain formation is conserved."

For infants in their first twelve months of life, the delivery of medications is challenging, and use of oral syringes to deliver liquid formulations can pose both practical and emotional challenges. Objective To explore the potential to deliver medicine to infants via a solid formulation during breastfeeding. Methods Single center feasibility study within a tertiary level neonatal unit in the UK, involving twenty-six breastfeeding mother-infant dyads. A solid formulation of Vitamin B12 was delivered to infants during breastfeeding. Outcomes included the quantitative change in serum vitamin B12 and assessment of maternal expectations and experiences. Results Delivery of Vitamin B12 through a solid formulation that dissolved in human milk did not impair breastfeeding, and Vitamin B12 levels rose in all infants from a mean baseline (range) 533 pg/mL (236–925 pg/mL) to 1871 pg/mL (610–4981 pg/mL) at 6–8 hours post-delivery. Mothers described the surprising ease of ‘drug’ delivery, with 85% reporting a preference over the use of syringes. Conclusions Solid drug formulations can be delivered during breastfeeding and were preferred by mothers over the delivery of liquid formulations via a syringe."
https://openalex.org/W4214945680,"Photosynthetic organisms have evolved light-harvesting antennae over time. In cyanobacteria, external phycobilisomes (PBSs) are the dominant antennae, whereas in green algae and higher plants, PBSs have been replaced by proteins of the Lhc family that are integrated in the membrane. Red algae represent an evolutionary intermediate between these two systems, as they employ both PBSs and membrane LHCR proteins as light-harvesting units. Understanding how red algae cope with light is not only interesting for biotechnological applications, but is also of evolutionary interest. For example, energy-dependent quenching (qE) is an essential photoprotective mechanism widely used by species from cyanobacteria to higher plants to avoid light damage; however, the quenching mechanism in red algae remains largely unexplored. Here, we used both pulse amplitude-modulated (PAM) and time-resolved chlorophyll fluorescence to characterize qE kinetics in the red alga Porphyridium purpureum. PAM traces confirmed that qE in P. purpureum is activated by a decrease in the thylakoid lumen pH, whereas time-resolved fluorescence results further revealed the quenching site and ultrafast quenching kinetics. We found that quenching exclusively takes place in the photosystem II (PSII) complexes and preferentially occurs at PSII's core antenna rather than at its reaction center, with an overall quenching rate of 17.6 ± 3.0 ns-1. In conclusion, we propose that qE in red algae is not a reaction center type of quenching, and that there might be a membrane-bound protein that resembles PsbS of higher plants or LHCSR of green algae that senses low luminal pH and triggers qE in red algae."

https://openalex.org/W4214850258,"The ribonucleases H (RNases H) of HIV and hepatitis B virus are type 1 RNases H that are promising drug targets because inhibiting their activity blocks viral replication. Eukaryotic ribonuclease H1 (RNase H1) is an essential protein and a probable off-target enzyme for viral RNase H inhibitors. α-hydroxytropolones (αHTs) are a class of anti-RNase H inhibitors that can inhibit the HIV, hepatitis B virus, and human RNases H1; however, it is unclear how these inhibitors could be developed to distinguish between these enzymes. To accelerate the development of selective RNase H inhibitors, we performed biochemical and kinetic studies on the human enzyme, which was recombinantly expressed in Escherichia coli. Size-exclusion chromatography showed that free RNase H1 is monomeric and forms a 2:1 complex with a substrate of 12 bp. FRET heteroduplex cleavage assays were used to test inhibition of RNase H1 in steady-state kinetics by two structurally diverse αHTs, 110 and 404. We determined that turnover rate was reduced, but inhibition was not competitive with substrate, despite inhibitor binding to the active site. Given the compounds' reversible binding to the active site, we concluded that traditional noncompetitive and mixed inhibition mechanisms are unlikely. Instead, we propose a model in which, by binding to the active site, αHTs stabilize an inactive enzyme-substrate-inhibitor complex. This new model clarifies the mechanism of action of αHTs against RNase H1 and will aid the development of RNase H inhibitors selective for the viral enzymes."

Despite evidence linking RORγt deficiency/inhibition with metastatic thymic T cell lymphomas, the role of RORγt in lymphoma metabolism is unknown. Chronic alcohol consumption plays a causal role in many human cancers. The risk of T cell lymphoma remains unclear in humans with alcohol use disorders (AUD) after chronic RORγt inhibition. Here we demonstrated that alcohol consumption accelerates RORγt deficiency-induced lymphomagenesis. Loss of RORγt signaling in the thymus promotes aerobic glycolysis and glutaminolysis and increases allocation of glutamine carbon into lipids. Importantly, alcohol consumption results in a shift from aerobic glycolysis to glutaminolysis. Both RORγt deficiency- and alcohol-induced metabolic alterations are mediated by c-Myc, as silencing of c-Myc decreases the effects of alcohol consumption and RORγt deficiency on glutaminolysis, biosynthesis, and tumor growth in vivo. The ethanol-mediated c-Myc activation coupled with increased glutaminolysis underscore the critical role of RORγt-Myc signaling and translation in lymphoma."

Using conditional gene targeting and analysis of hair morphogenesis, we show here that lack of Hif-p4h-2 in Forkhead box D1 (FoxD1)-lineage mesodermal cells interferes with the normal HF development in mice. FoxD1-lineage cells were found to be mainly mesenchymal cells located in the dermis of truncal skin, including those cells composing the DP of HFs. We found that upon Hif-p4h-2 inactivation, HF development was disturbed during the first catagen leading to formation of epithelial-lined HF cysts filled by unorganized keratins, which eventually manifested as truncal alopecia. Furthermore, the depletion of Hif-p4h-2 led to HIF stabilization and dysregulation of multiple genes involved in keratin formation, HF differentiation, and HIF, transforming growth factor β (TGF-β), and Notch signaling. We hypothesize that the failure of HF cycling is likely to be mechanistically caused by disruption of the interplay of the HIF, TGF-β, and Notch pathways. In summary, we show here for the first time that HIF-P4H-2 function in FoxD1-lineage cells is essential for the normal development and homeostasis of HFs."

Patients underwent corneal collagen cross-linking (32 patients), intrastromal corneal ring segments (48 patients), and a combination of these two procedures (21 patients). Transepithelial topography-guided photorefractive keratectomy was performed as the second stage of treatment in all patients with obtained stable refractive results at 8 months after first stage. Main outcome measures were visual acuity (uncorrected distance and corrected distance) and corneal topographic indices.Comparison of the studied parameters after first stage surgical treatment between non-combined CXL and combined groups demonstrated a statistically significant difference for uncorrected distance visual acuity, corrected distance visual acuity, and cylindrical refraction values (p<0.05). We observed significant improvement of visual acuity and key corneal topographic indices after topography-guided photorefractive keratectomy in all study groups (p<0.05). In 50 (49.5%) patients customized excimer laser ablation gave the possibility of full spherical and cylindrical corrections. Ten eyes (10%) had delayed epithelial healing, no corneal stromal opacities developed.This study shows that combined two-stage surgical treatment of keratoconus, consisting of intrastromal corneal ring segment implantation with corneal collagen cross-linking followed by topography-guided photorefractive keratectomy, is clinically more effective to prevent keratectasia progression and increase visual acuity than the use of non-combined two-stage techniques."
