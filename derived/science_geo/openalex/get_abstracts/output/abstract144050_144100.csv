https://openalex.org/W2003755391,"We have employed C2C12 myotubes to investigate lipid inhibition of insulin-stimulated signal transduction and glucose metabolism. Cells were preincubated for 18 h in the absence or presence of free fatty acids (FFAs) and stimulated with insulin, and the effects on glycogen synthesis and signaling intermediates were determined. While the unsaturated FFAs oleate and linoleate inhibited both basal and insulin-stimulated glycogen synthesis, the saturated FFA palmitate reduced only insulin-stimulated glycogen synthesis, and was found to inhibit insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of glycogen synthase kinase-3 and protein kinase B (PKB). However, no effect of palmitate was observed on tyrosine phosphorylation, p85 association, or phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activity in IRS-1 immunoprecipitates. In contrast, palmitate promoted phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein MAP) kinases. Ceramide, a derivative of palmitate, has recently been associated with similar inhibition of PKB, and here, ceramide levels were found to be elevated 2-fold in palmitate-treated C2C12 cells. Incubation of C2C12 cells with ceramide closely reproduced the effects of palmitate, leading to inhibition of glycogen synthesis and PKB and to stimulation of MAP kinase. We conclude that palmitate-induced insulin resistance occurs by a mechanism distinct from that of unsaturated FFAs, and involves elevation of ceramide by de novo synthesis, leading to PKB inhibition without affecting IRS-1 function."

A common feature of several of these conditions is migration of smooth muscle beyond the initial boundary of the organ. Signal transduction pathways activated by extracellular signals that instigate migration are mostly undefined in smooth muscles. We measured migration of cultured tracheal myocytes in response to platelet-derived growth factor, interleukin-1β, and transforming growth factor-β. Cellular migration was blocked by SB203580, an inhibitor of p38MAPK. Time course experiments demonstrated increased phosphorylation of p38MAPK. Activation of p38MAPK resulted in the phosphorylation of HSP27 (heat shockprotein 27), which may modulate F-actin polymerization. Inhibition of p38MAPK activity inhibited phosphorylation of HSP27. Adenovirus-mediated expression of activated mutant MAPK kinase 6b(E), an upstream activator for p38MAPK, increased cell migration, whereas overexpression of p38α MAPK dominant negative mutant and an HSP27 phosphorylation mutant blocked cell migration completely. The results indicate that activation of the p38MAPK pathway by growth factors and proinflammatory cytokines regulates smooth muscle cell migration and may contribute to pathological states involving smooth muscle dysfunction.

Evidence for critical roles of vascular smooth muscle cell migration has been suggested by the finding of cell clonality in lesions of atherosclerosis in postangioplasty restenosis remodeling and vascular smooth cell recruitment in angiogenesis (2Schwartz S.M.

In the respiratory system, recent studies have reported increased concentrations of several growth factors and cytokines in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid isolated from allergic asthmatic individuals (5Walker C. Bode E. Boer L. Hansel T.T. Blaser K. Virchow J.C.J. Am. Rev. Respir. Dis. 1992; 146: 109-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar). Postmortem studies have further indicated that over time, airway remodeling results from a thickening of the airway wall (6Jeffery P.K. Am. Rev. Respir. Dis. 1991; 143: 1152-1158Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Hypertrophy and hyperplasia of airway smooth muscle narrows the airway opening leading to increased resistance to airflow and more work required for breathing (7Wiggs B.R. Bosken C. Pare P.D. James A. Hogg J.C. Am. Rev. Respir. Dis. 1992; 145: 1251-1258Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). Many of these growth factors and cytokines such as platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF),1 interleukin-1β (IL-1β), and transforming growth factor-β (TGFβ) have been identified, but their signaling pathways are not well defined. An understanding of the signal transduction pathways contributing to smooth muscle remodeling and dysfunction will be useful in examining the underlying causes of numerous diseases. The mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) have been shown to play an important role in transducing extracellular signals into cellular responses (8Davis R.J. Mol. Reprod.

Specific MAPK cascades (MAPKKK → MAPKK → MAPK) are stimulated by a variety of signals including growth factors, cytokines, UV light, and other stress-inducing agents. MAPKs are believed to play a pivotal role in cell proliferation, apoptosis, differentiation, cytoskeleton remodeling, and the cell cycle (10Brunet A. Pouyssegur J.

These kinases can be categorized by the sequence of the activating canonical dual phosphorylation site threonine-Xaa-tyrosine (T X Y) (16Raingeaud J. Gupta S. Rogers J.S. Dickens M. Han J.

Current evidence suggests mammalian cells express at least three groups of MAPKs: extracellular signal-regulating kinases (ERK; where Xaa = Glu), p38MAPKs (where Xaa = Gly), and c-Jun N-terminal (where Xaa = Pro) kinases (17Boulton T.G.

It was first demonstrated in monocytes that p38MAPK is activated by bacterial lipopolysaccharide and the proinflammatory cytokines IL-1β and tumor necrosis factor-α (18Han J. Lee J.D. Bibbs L.

In the family of p38MAPKs, at least four isoforms have been identified (18Han J. Lee J.D. Bibbs L. Ulevitch R.J. Science. 1994; 265: 808-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (2413) Google Scholar, 25Jiang Y.

Experiments have demonstrated that p38MAPK lies downstream of the RAS-related GTP-binding proteins Rac and Cdc42 and is directly activated by kinases, MKK3, MKK4, and MKK6 (19Derijard B. Raingeaud J.

Several experiments have indicated that the small heat shock protein, HSP27, is a physiological substrate for these kinases. The phosphorylation of three serine residues on HSP27 appears to modulate the polymerization of actin and is proposed to play a role in actin, cytoskeleton remodeling during cellular stress, and growth (40Piotrowicz R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25920-25927Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Multiple protein systems such as actin, myosins, and microtubules are involved in cytoskeleton remodeling and cell migration. Although much is known about regulation of smooth muscle myosin by phosphorylation, less is known about remodeling of smooth muscle actin. It seems likely that many of the extracellular signals that stimulate actin remodeling in nonmuscle cells would do so in smooth muscles. However, little is known about the signal transduction pathways coupling cytokine and growth factor receptors to proteins that regulate actin remodeling in smooth muscle cells. In this report, a cell migration assay was used as an indirect measure of functional effects of actin cytoskeleton remodeling. We demonstrate that tracheal smooth muscle cells migrate in response to PDGF, IL-1β, and TGFβ, and we present data showing that these chemical mediators activate the p38MAPK pathway leading to the phosphorylation of HSP27. We also demonstrate that cellular migration is blocked by the p38MAPK specific inhibitor, SB203580 (22Lee J.C. Laydon J.T. McDonnell P.C. Gallagher T.F. Kumar S. Green D. McNulty D. Blumenthal M.J. Heys J.R. Landvatter S.W. Nature. 1994; 372: 739-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (3138) Google Scholar), and by overexpression of p38α MAPK dominant negative mutant and an HSP27 phosphorylation mutant. Furthermore, an upstream activator for p38MAPK, activated mutant MAPK kinase 6b(E) (MKK6bE) increased cell migration. Taken together, these results indicate that activation of p38MAPK pathway by proinflammatory cytokines and growth factors modulates smooth muscle migration and remodeling. Adult mongrel dogs of either sex were sacrificed by barbiturate overdose. The trachea was removed and placed in cold physiological salt solution composed of 2 mm MOPS, pH 7.4, 140 mm NaCl, 4.7 mm KCl, 1.2 mmMg2SO4, 2.5 mm CaCl2, 1.2 mm Na2HPO4, 0.02 mmethylenediaminetetraacetate, and 5.6 mmd-glucose. 32P was purchased from ICN Biomedicals, Inc. Phospho-specific p38MAPK antibodies were purchased from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). p38MAPKand MKK6 antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-FLAG-tagged antibodies were purchased from Eastman Kodak Co. Anti-hemagglutinin-tagged antibodies were purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Anti-human HSP27 was purchased from StressGen Biotechnologies Corp. (Victoria, BC, Canada). Anti-canine HSP27 has been previously described (41Larsen J.K. Yamboliev I.A. Weber L.A. Gerthoffer W.T. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: L930-L940PubMed Google Scholar). Anti-rabbit and anti-mouse IgG alkaline phosphatase conjugate antibodies were purchased from Promega Corp. (Madison, WI). SB203580 and PD98059 were purchased from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA). Cell migration was assayed using a modified Boyden chamber assay as described previously (24Rousseau S. Houle F. Landry J. Huot J. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 2169-2177Crossref PubMed Scopus (729) Google Scholar). Tracheal smooth muscle cells were dispersed using collagenase (0.6 mg/ml) and grown to confluence in M-199 culture medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 10% fetal bovine serum. At confluence, cells were placed in serum-free M-199 for 24 h prior to migration experiments. Smooth muscle cells were harvested with trypsin (0.1 mg/ml trypsin), counted, centrifuged, and resuspended at 8.0 × 105 cell/ml in 0.3% BSA M-199 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.). Cells were plated on the upper side of a collagen-treated, polycarbonate membrane (8.0 μm pore) separating two chambers of a 6.5-mm transwell culture plate (Costar). Cells were diluted in 0.3% BSA M-199 as a negative control (upper and lower chamber), or PDGF, IL-1β, or TGFβ (lower chamber) was added. SB203580 (25 μm), PD98059 (25 μm), or the vehicle (0.1% Me2SO) diluted in 0.3% BSA M-199 medium were added to both chambers 30 min before treatments. After 5 h, cells on the upper face of the membrane were scraped using a cotton swab. Cells that migrated to the lower face of the membrane were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde and stained with DifQuik (Baxter Scientific Products) Wright-Giemsa solution. The number of migrated cells on the lower face of the filter was counted in five fields under 10× magnification. Assays were done in duplicate and were repeated five times using cells from different animals. Trachea smooth muscle cells were grown on 6-well plates as described above for the cell migration experiments. After 24 h in serum-free medium, cells were stimulated with PDGF (10 ng/ml), IL-1β (6 ng/ml), and TGFβ (1 ng/ml) for the indicated time points at 37 °C in a CO2 incubator. Where indicated, cells were pretreated with 25 μm SB203580 for 30 min. The reaction was stopped by a wash in phosphate-buffered saline, and the cells were immediately lysed with 200 μl/well MAPK extraction buffer containing 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 5 mm EGTA, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1 mmNa3VO4, 1 mm NaF, 10 mmsodium β-glycerophosphate, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 10 μg/ml trypsin inhibitor, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin. Cellular extracts were clarified by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the supernatants were used to assay p38MAPKphosphorylation and kinase activation for HSP27. Protein concentrations were determined by the bicinchoninic acid method using bovine serum albumin as the standard. To assess phosphorylation of p38MAPK, total protein extracts (20 μg/lane) were separated by 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE). Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose paper in 25 mmTris, 192 mm glycine, 10% methanol using a Mini-Genie Blotter (Idea Scientific, Minneapolis, MN) (24 V for 2 h, under continuous cooling at 4 °C). Blots were blocked with 0.5% gelatin and probed with a dual anti-phosphotyrosine-threonine-p38MAPK or p38MAPK primary antibodies (1:500) and goat anti-rabbit-IgG alkaline phosphatase secondary antibody (1:5000). Images of immunoblots scanned with a UMAX Powerlook flatbed scanner were analyzed using the Volume Analyze feature of Molecular Analyst software (Bio-Rad). Densitometric data were normalized to the unstimulated control cells, and the linearity of the signal was described previously (23Hedges J.C. Yamboliev I.A. Ngo M. Horowitz B. Adam L.P. Gerthoffer W.T. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: C527-C534Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A 40-μl kinase reaction contained phosphorylation buffer (25 mm MOPS, 25 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 15 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 0.1 mm NaF, 1 mmNa3VO4, 4 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.2), cellular extracts (10 μg/ml total protein), and 0.15 mg/ml recombinant canine HSP27. Recombinant canine HSP27 (rHSP27) was expressed and purified as described previously (41Larsen J.K. Yamboliev I.A. Weber L.A. Gerthoffer W.T. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: L930-L940PubMed Google Scholar). The reaction was started by addition of 10 μCi of 250 μm[γ-32P]ATP. After incubation, at 30 °C for 30 min, the reactions were terminated by diluting them 1:4 with concentrated SDS sample buffer (0.24 m Tris, pH 6.8, 8% SDS, 40% glycerol, 4 mm dithiothreitol). Proteins were resolved by 12% acrylamide SDS-PAGE, and phosphorylated rHSP27 was visualized and quantitated with a Bio-Rad model 525 Molecular Imager. Phosphorylation of HSP27 was evaluated by labeling tracheal smooth muscle cells with H3[32P]O4. Cells were grown in M-199 medium (10% newborn calf serum) containing penicillin (100 units/ml)/streptomycin (100 μg/ml) on 6-well plates until 100% confluent. Cells were serum-starved on 0% newborn calf serum M-199 containing insulin (6.25 μg/ml), transferrin (6.25 μg/ml), and selenious acid (6.25 ng/ml) (ITS, Collaborative Biomedical, town, MA) for 24 h. Cells were preincubated for 2 h in 0.3% BSA, phosphate-free M-199 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 25 μCi/ml H3[32P]O4 (900–1100 mCi/mmol). Control cells were untreated, and stimulated cells were treated with 200 μm NaAsO2, 10 ng/ml PDGF, 6 ng/ml IL-1β, and 1 ng/ml TGFβ for 30 min. Immediately after treatments, the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and then lysed in 200 μl of MAPK extraction buffer. Cell lysates were sonicated for 5 min and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 5 min. The supernatant was removed, and proteins were fractionated by SDS-PAGE. Radioactivity incorporated in HSP27 was evaluated by phosphorimaging. HSP27 was identified by immunoblotting using polyclonal anti-canine HSP27 antibodies (41Larsen J.K. Yamboliev I.A. Weber L.A. Gerthoffer W.T. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: L930-L940PubMed Google Scholar). The mass of HSP27 was also evaluated by immunoblotting using recombinant canine HSP27 standards, and linearity of the signal was determined on a separate gel (data not shown). Adenoviruses expressing activated MKK6bE and the p38α MAPK dominant negative (TGY → AGF) mutant (p38αdn) were a generous gift from Dr. Yibin Wang (University of Maryland) and have been described previously (42Wang Y. Su B. Sah V.P. Brown J.H. Han J. Chien K.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5423-5426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). Ad-3A and Ad-WT are replication-defective adenoviral recombinants prepared as described previously (43Martin J.L. Mestril R. Hilal-Dandan R. Brunton L.L. Dillmann W.H. Circulation. 1997; 96: 4343-4348Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). Ad-3A contains cDNA for mutant human HSP27 (Ad-3A). Ad-WT contains an insert coding for wild type human HSP27. Expression of the transgenes are driven by a cytomegalovirus (CMV)-promoter inserted in the E1 region of E1 deleted human adenovirus type 5. Ad-R is an empty control vector. Mutant HSP27 differs from the wild type in that the three known phosphorylation sites (Ser-15, Ser-78, and Ser-82) were mutated to alanines (44Landry J. Lambert H. Zhou M. Lavoie J.N. Hickey E. Weber L.A. Anderson C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 794-803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It has been previously demonstrated that mutation of these sites to nonphosphorylatable amino acids (glycines) results in a phosphorylation deficient mutant (45Lavoie J.N. Hickey E. Weber L.A. Landry J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24210-24214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 46Lavoie J.N. Lambert H. Hickey E. Weber L.A. Landry J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 505-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar). The triple alanine mutant was made using the Muta Gene Kit (Bio-Rad). The Eco RI-Sma I fragment of the glycine triple mutant (45Lavoie J.N. Hickey E. Weber L.A. Landry J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24210-24214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was subcloned into M13 mp19 and grown in the host Escherichia coli strain CJ237. Primers were obtained to change codons 78 and 82 to alanine (primer sequence, GCG CGC TCG CCC GGC AAC TCG CCA GCG GGG) and to convert codon 15 to alanine (primer sequence:, CTC CTG CGG GGC CCC GCC TGG GAC CCC TTC). Following mutagenesis according to the kit protocol, template was prepared from phage containing either the codon 78+82 to ala mutation, or the codon15 to ala mutation. The subcloned, mutagenized gene fragment was completely sequenced to verify the intended mutation and to exclude the possibility of other sequences being altered during the mutagenesis protocol. Restriction fragments were ligated into the hsp27 gene in the plasmid Bluescript KS to reconstruct a clone containing all three serine-alanine codon changes. The final clone was verified by double strand sequencing. Adenovirus vectors were produced and purified from the 293 packaging cell line (Microbix, Toronto, ON, Canada) as described previously (47Graham F.L. Prevec L. Mol. Biotechnol. 1995; 3: 207-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). Cells were infected with Ad vectors at a multiplicity of infection of 20 plaque-forming units/cell. Medium was removed, and 1 × 105 cells/well were infected with 200 μl of diluted virus in phosphate-buffered saline for 60 min. The cells were incubated in 2 ml/well of low serum (0.1% newborn calf serum) for 4–7 days. Cells were then used in the cell migration assay as described above or for biochemical assays. Transduction efficiency (greater than 95%) and transgene expression were verified by immunoblotting and immunofluorescence. One-dimensional isoelectric focusing (IEF) was used to separate nonphosphorylated and phosphorylated isoforms of HSP27. Proteins were extracted in SDS sample buffer (60 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 1% glycerol, 1 μm leupeptin, 10 mm EGTA, 1 mmNa2EDTA, 1 mm p-aminoethylbenzenesulfonyl fluoride HCl, and 5 mm NaF). Samples were diluted in an equal volume of IEF buffer (9.0 m urea, 2% Chaps, 2% ampholines (75% Bio-lyte 5–7. 25% Bio-lyte 3–10, 5% β-mercaptoethanol, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm EDTA). IEF was carried out on tube gels as described previously (46Lavoie J.N. Lambert H. Hickey E. Weber L.A. Landry J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 505-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar). IEF tube gels were equilibrated in SDS sample buffer for 1 h at 37 °C. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose as described above and were probed with a canine HSP27 anti-serum (1:500) or an anti-human HSP27 monoclonal antibody (1:2000) followed by goat anti-rabbit-IgG or anti-mouse-IgG alkaline phosphatase secondary antibody (1:15000), respectively. Images of immunoblots were analyzed as described above. Densitometric data of HSP27 isoforms were expressed as percentages of total HSP27. Validity of this technique is based on our previous study describing phosphorylation of charge isoforms of HSP27 in tracheal smooth muscle (41Larsen J.K. Yamboliev I.A. Weber L.A. Gerthoffer W.T. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: L930-L940PubMed Google Scholar). Analysis between two groups was performed using unpaired two-tailed t tests, where p values less than 0.05 are considered significantly different. Smooth muscle cells are exposed to numerous growth factors and proinflammatory cytokines that contribute to smooth muscle remodeling during asthma, atherosclerosis, and angiogenesis (1Stewart A.G. Tomlinson P.R. Wilson J. Trends. Pharmacol. Sci. 1993; 14: 275-279Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 2Schwartz S.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: S87-S89PubMed Google Scholar, 3Ross R. Nature. 1993; 362: 801-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (9990) Google Scholar). Some of these growth factors and cytokines such as PDGF, IL-1β, and TGFβ have been identified, but their signaling pathways are not well defined. In many of these disease states smooth muscle cells migrate and begin to proliferate. Cell migration depends on the remodeling of cytoskeletal proteins such as actin and myosin, and it has been shown that blocking actin remodeling inhibits cell motility (24Rousseau S. Houle F. Landry J. Huot J. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 2169-2177Crossref PubMed Scopus (729) Google Scholar). Moreover, phosphorylation of HSP27 modulates actin remodeling (45Lavoie J.N. Hickey E. Weber L.A. Landry J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24210-24214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and phosphorylation of HSP27 is regulated by the p38MAPK/MAPKAP-2/3 pathway (48Guay J. Lambert H. Gingras-Breton G. Lavoie J.N. Huot J. Landry J. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 357-368Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To test the hypothesis that a decrease in p38MAPK signaling and phosphorylation of HSP27 would inhibit cell motility, we assayed cell migration using a modified Boyden chamber assay (49Kundra V. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 725-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). We plated tracheal smooth muscle cells on collagen-coated polycarbonate upper membranes and added PDGF, IL-1β, and TGFβ to the lower chamber of a transwell culture plate. Cell migration was assayed after 5 h, and the results are presented in Fig. 1. PDGF (1–10 ng/ml) and the proinflammatory cytokine, IL-1β (1–6 ng/ml) stimulated a concentration-dependent increase in cell migration with greater than 8- and 6-fold increases in migration compared with control cells, respectively (Fig. 1). TGFβ (1–5 ng/ml) also stimulated an increase in cell migration at an optimal concentration of 1 ng/ml, whereas higher concentrations seem to be inhibitory (Fig.1 B). To test the notion that the p38MAPK pathway has a role in cell migration induced by cytokines and growth factors, we pretreated tracheal myocytes with SB203580. SB203580 is a pyridinyl imidazole inhibitor of p38α and p38β MAPK isoforms that, as we have shown, blocks p38MAPK activation and HSP27 phosphorylation with no effect on the ERK MAPKs in tracheal smooth muscle (41Larsen J.K. Yamboliev I.A. Weber L.A. Gerthoffer W.T. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: L930-L940PubMed Google Scholar). Cellular migration was blocked after myocytes were pretreated with 25 μm SB203580 for 30 min (Fig. 1). Cell migration was reduced nearly to that of the unstimulated control cells. Because it has been reported that PDGF activates the ERK1/2 pathway, we tested the notion that ERK1/2 also has a significant role in PDGF-stimulated smooth muscle c"

Transcriptional mechanisms are also involved in receptor expression, but these are poorly understood. In this study we have characterized the transferrin receptor promoter region and identified a functional hypoxia response element that contains a binding site for hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1). Exposure of K562 and HeLa cells to hypoxia for 16 h resulted in a 2- to 3-fold increase in transferrin receptor mRNA expression. A motif with multipartite organization similar to the hypoxia response element of a number of hypoxia-inducible genes such as erythropoietin was identified within a 100-base pair sequence upstream of the transcriptional start site. Mutation of a site similar to the consensus HIF-binding site (HBS) in this motif attenuated the hypoxic response by 80%. Transient co-expression of the two HIF-1 subunits (HIF-1α and HIF-1β) enhanced the wild type transferrin receptor promoter activity, but that which contained a mutated HBS yielded no such response. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays revealed that HIF-1 was stimulated and bound to the transferrin receptor HBS upon hypoxic challenge.

Pelosi E. Peschle C. Crit. Rev. Oncog. 1993; 4: 241-276PubMed Google Scholar, 2Ponka P. Lok C.N. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1999; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). Cellular iron uptake from transferrin involves the binding of transferrin to the transferrin receptor, internalization of transferrin within an endocytic vesicle by receptor-mediated endocytosis, and the release of iron from the protein by a decrease in endosomal pH (3Baker E. Morgan E.H. Brock J.H. Halliday J.W. Pippard M.J. Powell L.W. Iron Metabolism in Health and Disease. W. B. Saunders Company, Ltd., London1994: 63-95Google Scholar, 4Richardson D.R. Ponka P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1331: 1-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar). Iron released from transferrin is then transported through the endosomal membrane, and a compelling candidate for serving this function is “natural resistance-associated macrophage protein 2” (Nramp2), also known as DCT1 (divalent cation transporter 1) (5Fleming M.D. Andrews N.C. J. Lab. Clin. Med. 1998; 32: 464-468Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (36) Google Scholar). After its release from endosomes, iron is transported to intracellular sites of use and/or storage, and the iron-free transferrin that remains receptor-bound returns to the cell surface where apotransferrin is released from the cells (3Baker E. Morgan E.H. Brock J.H. Halliday J.W. Pippard M.J. Powell L.W. Iron Metabolism in Health and Disease. W. B. Saunders Company, Ltd., London1994: 63-95Google Scholar, 4Richardson D.R. Ponka P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1331: 1-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar). With the exception of highly differentiated cells such as erythrocytes, transferrin receptors are probably expressed on all cells, but their levels vary greatly (2Ponka P. Lok C.N. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1999; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar, 4Richardson D.R. Ponka P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1331: 1-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar). Transferrin receptors are highly expressed on immature erythroid cells, placental tissue, and rapidly dividing cells, both normal and malignant. In proliferating nonerythroid cells, the expression of transferrin receptors is negatively regulated post-transcriptionally by intracellular iron through iron-responsive elements (IREs)1 in the 3′ untranslated region of the transferrin receptor mRNA. IREs are recognized by specific cytoplasmic proteins (iron regulatory proteins (IRPs)) that, under conditions of decreased iron in the labile pool, bind to the IREs of transferrin receptor mRNA, preventing its degradation. On the other hand, the expansion of the labile iron pool leads to a rapid degradation of transferrin receptor mRNA, which is not protected since IRPs are not bound to it (6Klausner R.D. Rouault T.A. Harford J.B. Cell. 1993; 72: 19-28Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1045) Google Scholar, 7Hentze M.W. Kühn L.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8175-8182Crossref PubMed Scopus (1126) Google Scholar). However, some cells and tissues with specific requirements for iron probably evolved mechanisms that can override the IRE/IRP-dependent control of transferrin receptor expression. Erythroid cells, which are the most avid consumers of iron in the organism, use a transcriptional mechanism to maintain very high transferrin receptor levels (8Ponka P. Blood. 1997; 89: 1-25Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Transcriptional regulation is probably also involved in the receptor induction when resting cells are activated to proliferate and during T and B lymphocyte activation (2Ponka P. Lok C.N. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1999; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). Although the transcriptional regulation of the transferrin receptor is not fully understood, deletion analysis identified a minimal region of about 100 base pairs upstream from the transcriptional start site that drives both basal as well as serum/mitogenic stimulation of promoter activity (9Owen D. Kühn L.C. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 1287-1293Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 10Ouyang Q. Bommakanti M. Miskimins W.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1796-1804Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). This promoter region also contains elements such as the Ets-binding site and the adjacent AP-1-like sequence, necessary for the transcriptional up-regulation of the transferrin receptor during erythroid differentiation. 2C. N. Lok and P. Ponka, submitted for publication. 2C. N. Lok and P. Ponka, submitted for publication. Recently hypoxia was shown to increase transferrin receptor expression in a hepatoma cell line (11Toth I. Yuan L. Rogers J.T. Boyce H. Bridges K.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4467-4473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) and endothelial cells (12Dore-Duffy P. Balabanov D. Beaumont T. Hritz M.A. Harik S.I. LaManna J.C. Microvasc. Res. 1999; 57: 75-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), and it has been proposed that this increase is due to the hypoxia-enhanced IRE/IRP-1 binding and consequent stabilization of the transferrin receptor message (11Toth I. Yuan L. Rogers J.T. Boyce H. Bridges K.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4467-4473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). However, in the course of our studies on the transcriptional control of the transferrin receptor expression, we have noticed that the promoter region of the transferrin receptor gene contains a sequence very similar to the hypoxia response element (HRE) that mediates transcriptional activation by hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1). HIF-1 (13Semenza G.L. Wang G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5447-5454Crossref PubMed Scopus (2137) Google Scholar, 14Wang G.L. Semenza G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Poyton R.O. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 839-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (1037) Google Scholar). These genes include erythropoietin (Epo) (13Semenza G.L. Wang G.L. Mol. Cell.

Hypoxia-induced activation of HIF-1 involves, at least in part, a decrease in oxygen-sensitive degradation of the HIF-1α and an increase in its binding to the HIF-1-binding site (HBS) present in the HRE (23Huang L.E. Gu J. Schau M. Bunn H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7987-7992Crossref PubMed Scopus (1820) Google Scholar). In this study we demonstrated that the transferrin receptor gene contains a functional HRE that binds HIF-1, which regulates receptor expression under hypoxic conditions. K562 cells were maintained in RPMI medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 2 mmglutamine. For hypoxic stimulation, cells were seeded at 5 × 105 cells/ml and put in modular incubator. Hypoxic conditions were produced by purging the incubator with 95% N2, 5% CO2 at 2 pounds/square inch for 15 min, after which the incubator was sealed for 16 h. The partial pressure of O2 of the medium in hypoxic condition was below 22 mm Hg as measured by a blood gas analyzer. After incubation at normal or low O2 tension, the cells were washed, and the total RNA was isolated by guanidine thiocyanate/acid phenol extraction. Total RNA (10 μg) was denatured in formamide/formaldehyde, size-fractionated on formaldehyde/agarose gels, and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Hybridization was performed using 32P-random-labeled probes derived from human transferrin receptor cDNA and human β-actin cDNA. The transferrin receptor promoter-luciferase reporter plasmid was constructed by subcloning a polymerase chain reaction fragment of the transferrin receptor promoter region (−118 to +14) into pGL2 basic vector (9Owen D. Kühn L.C. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 1287-1293Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Mutations of the putative regulatory elements were generated by a unique site elimination mutagenesis kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and were confirmed by sequencing. The mutagenesis primers and the sense strands of the oligonucleotides used in electrophoresis mobility shift assays were as follows. TR [HBS]: 5′-CGC GAG CGT ACG TGC CTC AGG-3′ TR [HBSm]: 5′-CGC GAG CGT ACt aGt CTC AGG-3′ EPO [HBS]: 5′-GCC CTA CGT GCT GCC TCG CAT-3′ TR[CRE]: 5′-TCA GGA AGT GAC GCA CAG CCC-3′ TR [CREm]: 5′-TCA GGA AGT cga cCA CAG CCC-3′ For each transfection, 1 × 106 K562 cells were transfected with 1 μg of the reporter plasmid by LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.), according to the manufacturer's protocol. After transfection, the cells were incubated under the defined conditions for 16 h. Luciferase and galactosidase activities in the cell extracts were determined by chemoluminescence assay kits (Promega and Tropix) with a luminometer (Bio-Orbit). Transfection efficiencies were monitored by co-transfection of 0.2 μg of SV40-galactosidase reporter. In some experiments, 0.5 μg of expression plasmids of HIF-1α and/or HIF-1β (kindly provided by Jerry Pelletier (37Moffett P. Reece M. Pelletier J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4933-4947Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar)) were co-transfected with 2 μg of transferrin receptor reporter. The total amounts of the transfected plasmids were normalized by pGEM plasmids. Nuclear extracts were prepared as described previously (13Semenza G.L. Wang G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5447-5454Crossref PubMed Scopus (2137) Google Scholar), with the final dialysis step omitted. Lysis of cells was done within 5 min of their removal from the hypoxic chamber. The binding reaction mixtures were pre-mixed in a volume of 18 μl with a final concentration of 5 μg of nuclear proteins, 0.2 μg of poly(dI·dC), 100 mmNaCl, 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 5% glycerol and incubated for 10 min at room temperature. The32P-labeled oligonucleotide probe (20 fmol, 100,000 cpm in 2 μl) was then added, and the incubation was continued at room temperature for a further 30 min. For competition EMSAs, a 100-fold excess of the cold oligonucleotides were added during the preincubation period. For supershift assays, 1 μg of anti-HIF-1α (Transduction Laboratories) or anti-Jun (Santa Cruz) antibodies was added to the complete binding reaction mixtures, and the incubation was allowed to continue for 30 min on ice. The DNA-protein complexes were resolved on 6% polyacrylamide gels as described elsewhere (13Semenza G.L. Wang G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5447-5454Crossref PubMed Scopus (2137) Google Scholar). Transferrin receptor mRNA levels in cells incubated under control and hypoxic conditions were measured using Northern blot analysis. Fig. 1 shows that after the exposure of both K562 and HeLa cells to hypoxia for 16 h, the levels of transferrin receptor mRNA increase 2- to 3-fold. By contrast, decreases of β-actin mRNA were observed in cells incubated at low O2 pressure. Because the hypoxic induction of proteins often involves binding of HIF-1 to HRE in their respective genes, we examined whether a consensus HRE was present in the transferrin receptor gene. Indeed, we found that the promoter region of the transferrin receptor gene (Fig.2) contains a sequence highly similar to the HRE found in genes for Epo (13Semenza G.L. Wang G.L. Mol. Cell.

Most of the hypoxia response elements exhibit multipartite organization including at least one core HBS and one or two cis-acting elements that are necessary for full inducibility of the gene by hypoxia (reviewed in Ref. 24Semenza G.L. J. Lab. Clin. Med. 1998; 131: 207-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2, a HIF-1-binding site with the invariant sequence RCGTG is present not only in known hypoxia-responsible genes but also in the transferrin receptor gene. Seven base pairs of the putative HBS of the transferrin receptor gene (TACGTGC) are identical to the HBS of several hypoxia-regulated genes such as Epo (13Semenza G.L. Wang G.L. Mol. Cell.

Biol. 1992; 12: 5447-5454Crossref PubMed Scopus (2137) Google Scholar) and VEGF (18Levy A.P. Levy N.S. Wegner S. Goldberg M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13333-13340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (875) Google Scholar) genes have a CACAG sequence located in close proximity to the HBS. In addition, both the HBS in the transferrin receptor gene and the HBS in the lactate dehydrogenase A gene (16Firth J.D. Ebert B.L. Ratcliffe P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21021-21027Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar, 26Ebert B.L. Bunn H.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4089-4096Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar) have a nearby cyclic AMP-responsive element (CRE). Fig. 2 also shows that the putative HREs in human and mouse transferrin receptor genes (sequence kindly provided by Nancy Andrews and Joanne Levy) are well conserved. To determine whether the HBS in the transferrin receptor gene is an authentic HBS that can be recognized by HIF-1, electrophoretic mobility shift assays were performed using nuclear extracts prepared from cells incubated under hypoxic and normoxic conditions and the radiolabeled oligonucleotide harboring the putative HBS of the transferrin receptor and its flanking sequence. Fig. 3 shows that this oligomer bound constitutive factors present in both normoxic and hypoxic samples. Importantly, an induced binding activity appeared in nuclear extracts prepared from hypoxic cells (Fig. 3, lane 2), but such a binding activity was virtually undetectable in extracts from the normoxic control (Fig. 3, lane 1). This hypoxia-induced activity represents a specific binding factor since an excess of the unlabeled oligomer completely abolished its binding to the radiolabeled probe (Fig. 3, lane 3). Furthermore, an oligomer harboring the consensus HBS of the Epo gene also effectively competed with the radiolabeled probe for the binding activity (Fig. 3, lane 5). In contrast, the transferrin receptor oligomer whose putative HBS was mutated neither competed with the probe for the binding activity (Fig. 3, lane 4) nor bound hypoxia-induced factors when it was radiolabeled (Fig. 3, lane 10). The identity of the binding activity induced by hypoxia was investigated by supershift assays using antibodies raised against the HIF-1α. As shown in Fig. 3 (lane 6), anti-HIF-1α was able to “supershift” the hypoxia-induced binding activity. Collectively these data indicate that the HBS of the transferrin receptor behaves similarly as consensus HBS and that it can bind HIF-1. To further investigate the function of a potential HRE of the transferrin receptor gene, a reporter gene construct linking the promoter region containing the HRE and a luciferase gene was constructed and transiently transfected into K562 cells (Fig. 4). This promoter region conferred a basal promoter activity under normoxic conditions. Exposure of the cells to hypoxia resulted in an approximately 8-fold increase in promoter activity, but disruption of the putative HBS attenuated the hypoxic stimulation of the transferrin receptor promoter activity by 80%. These data indicate that the HBS in the transferrin receptor promoter is functionally identical to the consensus HBS present in other hypoxia-regulated genes. We also tested whether the CRE site plays a role in response to hypoxia. Although a 7-fold higher activity was still observed in hypoxia-stimulated samples as compared with normoxic samples, the mutation of the CRE significantly reduced both basal and hypoxia-stimulated promoter activity (Fig. 4). Taken together, these results indicate that the HBS is specifically involved in the hypoxia-stimulated promoter activity and that the CRE site may be required for optimal hypoxic response. The functionality of the transferrin receptor HRE was further studied by transient transfection of HIF-1 subunits together with the transferrin receptor HRE-luciferase reporter gene (Fig.5). Transfections with either HIF-1α or HIF-β subunit moderately increased the promoter activity whereas co-transfections with both α and β subunits resulted in a further significant increase in the reporter activity. In contrast, transfection of HIF-1 did not affect the activity of the luciferase reporter when the transferrin receptor HBS was mutated. The biological response induced by hypoxia can be mimicked by treatment with cobaltous ion or iron chelators, which mediate their effects in part by activating HIF-1 (presumably through perturbation of oxygen-sensing processes) (reviewed in Ref. 15Bunn H.F. Poyton R.O. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 839-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (1037) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.6, treatment of cells with either cobalt chloride or the iron chelator desferrioxamine moderately stimulated transferrin receptor-HRE reporter activity, induced HIF-1 binding to the HBS of the transferrin receptor gene in EMSA and enhanced transferrin receptor mRNA expression. These results further support the notion that the transferrin receptor gene is activated by hypoxia and that it contains functional HRE. This study demonstrated that transferrin receptor gene is hypoxically induced in K562 and HeLa cells (Fig. 1). One possible mechanism by which hypoxia can regulate transferrin receptor mRNA expression is through the transcription factor HIF-1. Most HIF-1-regulated genes contain an enhancer sequence termed HRE, which harbors the HBS as well as one or two additional cis-acting elements in the vicinity of the HBS (reviewed in Ref. 24Semenza G.L. J. Lab. Clin. Med. 1998; 131: 207-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Indeed, we demonstrated that the transferrin receptor promoter region contains a functional HRE with a HBS that can bind HIF-1. The HRE of the transferrin receptor exhibits multipartite organization similar to several known HREs of genes such as Epo and VEGF (Fig. 2). The HREs of these genes, as well as that of transferrin receptor gene, contain HBS with the core sequence RCGTG and an adjacent CACAG sequence. The HRE of the transferrin receptor is also similar to that of lactate dehydrogenase A, both of which contain the HBS and a nearby CRE site (Fig. 2). The structural features of the HRE in the transferrin receptor (HBS, CRE, and CACAG sequences) are well conserved in the corresponding mouse sequence (Fig. 2). These sequence data have, therefore, suggested that transferrin receptor HREs have functional importance. We confirmed this by electrophoretic mobility shift assays, which showed that the HBS of the human transferrin receptor gene binds HIF-1 (Fig. 3). Moreover, our studies clearly demonstrated that the wild type but not HBS-mutated transferrin receptor promoter (−118 to +14) conferred hypoxic inducibility to the luciferase reporter gene in K562 cells (Fig. 4). Furthermore, transient co-expression of the two HIF-1 subunits (HIF-1α and HIF-1β) enhanced the transferrin receptor promoter activity (Fig. 5). These results indicate that the transferrin receptor gene contains a functional HRE. In addition, cobaltous ion, which can mimic hypoxia, also stimulated both HIF-1 binding to the HBS of the transferrin receptor and activated its promoter activity (Fig. 6). Interestingly, desferrioxamine had effects very similar to those seen with cobalt (Fig. 6). Desferrioxamine lowers intracellular iron levels and is thought to perturb a redox-based oxygen-sensing process (reviewed in Ref. 15Bunn H.F. Poyton R.O. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 839-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (1037) Google Scholar). It is noteworthy that K562 cells treated with desferrioxamine were demonstrated to have a higher transcription rate of transferrin receptor than iron-replete cells (25Rao K. Harford J.B. Rouault T. McClelland A. Ruddle F.H. Klausner R.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 236-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). However, there is no doubt that desferrioxamine increases transferrin receptor mRNA levels via the IRE/IRP mechanisms (6Klausner R.D. Rouault T.A. Harford J.B. Cell. 1993; 72: 19-28Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1045) Google Scholar, 7Hentze M.W. Kühn L.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8175-8182Crossref PubMed Scopus (1126) Google Scholar). The similarity between the regulation of transferrin receptor and lactate dehydrogenase A by HIF-1 is of particular interest (Fig. 2). As already mentioned, the promoter regions of both the transferrin receptor and lactate dehydrogenase A genes contain HRE comprised of a HBS and a nearby CRE site. Although the HBS is clearly necessary for hypoxia-enhanced activity of both promoters, the CRE site is required for optimal hypoxic response. The CRE site of the lactate dehydrogenase A was shown to bind CREB-1/ATF-1 transcription factors (26Ebert B.L. Bunn H.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4089-4096Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Interestingly, both HIF-1 and CREB-1/ATF-1 interact at the HRE with p300/CREB-binding protein (26Ebert B.L. Bunn H.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4089-4096Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 27Arany Z. Huang L.E. Eckner R. Bhattacharya S. Jiang C. Goldberg M.A. Bunn H.F. Livingston D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12969-12973Crossref PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar), the transcriptional adapter proteins that act as signaling bridges between a number of specific DNA-bound transcription factors and the basal transcription machinery. The CRE site of the transferrin receptor gene also recognizes CREB-1/ATF-1, 3C. N. Lok and P. Ponka, unpublished data. and hence, it seems likely that similar molecular mechanisms are involved in the HIF-1-mediated transcription. It is now well established that post-transcriptional regulation via IRE/IRP system plays an important role in the control of transferrin receptor expression in response to changes in intracellular iron levels (6Klausner R.D. Rouault T.A. Harford J.B. Cell. 1993; 72: 19-28Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1045) Google Scholar, 7Hentze M.W. Kühn L.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8175-8182Crossref PubMed Scopus (1126) Google Scholar). When cellular iron becomes limiting, IRP-2 is present in the cytosol, and IRP-1 is recruited into a high affinity binding state. The binding of IRPs to the IREs in the 3′-untranslated region of transferrin receptor mRNA stabilizes this transcript. On the other hand, when intracellular iron is plentiful, IRP-1 contains a [4Fe-4S] cluster, in which form it is unable to bind to IREs, and IRP-2 is degraded. Hence, in iron-replete cells, IRPs are not available for binding to the IREs, resulting in a rapid degradation of transferrin receptor mRNA. However, iron is not the only species that modulates IRP-1 binding activity, IRP-2 levels, and consequently, transferrin receptor expression. RNA binding activity of IRP-1 can be stimulated by nitric oxide (28Weiss G. Goossen B. Doppler W. Fuchs D. Pantopoulos K. Werner-Felmayer G. Wachter H. Hentze M.W. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3651-3657Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar, 29Richardson D.R. Neumannova V. Nagy E. Ponka P. Blood. 1995; 86: 3211-3219Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or hydrogen peroxide (30Pantopoulos K. Hentze M.W. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2917-2924Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar), suggesting that “oxidative stress” affects cellular iron metabolism. Since cellular production of reactive oxygen species is related to O2 concentration, the effects of hypoxia on IRP-1 and IRP-2 RNA binding activity were investigated, but the results obtained are somewhat controversial. Hanson and Leibold (31Hanson E.S. Leibold E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7588-7593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) showed that hypoxia inactivated IRP-1 binding to RNA and recently reported that hypoxia increased IRP-2 levels by a post-translational mechanism involving protein stability (32Hanson E.S. Foot L.M. Leibold E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5047-5052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). However, it is unclear what the overall functional consequences of these changes are, since transferrin receptor expression after hypoxia remains to be examined. On the other hand, Toth et al. (11Toth I. Yuan L. Rogers J.T. Boyce H. Bridges K.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4467-4473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) found that hypoxia enhances IRE/IRP-1 binding that was associated with a significant increase in transferrin receptor mRNA levels. Our findings reported here, together with the aforementioned data (11Toth I. Yuan L. Rogers J.T. Boyce H. Bridges K.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4467-4473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 31Hanson E.S. Leibold E.A. J. Biol.

Chem. 1999; 274: 5047-5052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), indicate that multiple hypoxia-stimulated mechanisms may exist to modulate transferrin receptor expression. It is not surprising that both transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms operate to regulate transferrin receptor expression, as in the case of prototypic hypoxia-inducible genes such as erythropoietin and VEGF (reviewed in Ref. 15Bunn H.F. Poyton R.O. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 839-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (1037) Google Scholar). Our data indicate the transferrin receptor gene possesses a functional HRE that plays a role in hypoxia-regulated transcription. It is tempting to speculate that the HRE of the transferrin receptor gene, in cooperation with other specific enhancers, is involved in the receptor transcription in a tissue- and stage-specific manner. In addition to transferrin receptor, several other genes involved in iron transport appear to be modulated by low oxygen tension. Transferrin expression in hepatoma cells has been shown to be stimulated by hypoxia via a HIF-1/HRE-mediated mechanism (22Rolfs A. Kvietikova I. Gassmann M. Wenger R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20055-20062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). Moreover, a putative HBS has been identified in the promoter region of Nramp2/DCT1 (33Lee P.L. Gelbart T. West C. Halloran C. Beutler E. Blood Cells Mol. Dis. 1998; 24: 199-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Taken together, these reports support a model that hypoxia may augment the overall iron transport machinery, resulting in increasing iron uptake into the cells. Although iron is involved in multiple physiological processes such as oxygen transport, oxidative energy production, and cell growth and development, the biological significance of enhanced transferrin receptor expression during hypoxia remains to be determined. The most typical physiological response elicited by hypoxia is the increase in production of erythropoietin, which stimulates erythropoiesis. Differentiation of erythroid precursors to hemoglobin-synthesizing cells is associated with an enhanced iron uptake mediated by the increase in transferrin receptor expression in the developing erythroid cells. There is no doubt that erythropoietin-mediated mechanisms directly stimulate transferrin receptor expression (8Ponka P. Blood. 1997; 89: 1-25Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and hence, the effect of hypoxia on receptor expression can be only partial. However, it cannot be ruled out that both erythropoietin and hypoxia can cooperate to drive maximal expression of transferrin receptors under severe hypoxic conditions. Alternatively, it will be interesting to examine the effect of hypoxia on transferrin receptor expression in heart or skeletal muscle as the enhanced synthesis of hemoproteins such as myoglobin in these tissues during hypoxia has been demonstrated (34Terrados N. Jansson E. Sulven C. Kaijser L. J. Appl. Physiol. 1990; 68: 2369-2372Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 35Guiang 3rd, S.F. Widness J.A. Flanagan K.B. Schmidt R.L. Radmer W.J. Georgieff M.K.

The function of these structures and the requirement for different types of intermediate filament proteins by individual cells are only partly understood. Here we have addressed the role of specific intermediate filament protein partnerships in the formation of intermediate filaments in astrocytes.

We used mice with targeted mutations in the GFAP or vimentin genes, or both, to study the impact of loss of either or both of these proteins on intermediate filament formation in cultured astrocytes and in normal or reactive astrocytes in vivo. We report that nestin cannot form intermediate filaments on its own, that vimentin may form intermediate filaments with either nestin or GFAP as obligatory partners, and that GFAP is the only intermediate filament protein of the three that may form filaments on its own.

These 10-nm thin structures form an interconnected scaffolding-like network within the cell cytoplasm. IFs are composed of different IF proteins, depending on the cell type, the developmental stage, and in some cases also on the functional status of a given cell (1Fuchs E. Cleveland D.W. Science. 1998; 279: 514-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (833) Google Scholar). This can be well demonstrated in astrocytes, in which three IF proteins may be found: nestin, vimentin, and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). Nestin and vimentin are the main IF proteins in immature astroglial cells, whereas maturing and adult astrocytes contain vimentin and GFAP. Nestin production is resumed, and vimentin and GFAP expression is up-regulated in activated astrocytes in reactive gliosis accompanying, e.g., trauma, tumor growth, or neurodegenerative diseases affecting the CNS (2Eng L.F. Ghirnikar R.S. Brain Pathol. 1994; 4: 229-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (714) Google Scholar,3Frisén J. Johansson C.B. Török C. Risling M. Lendahl U. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 453-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). The reasons for the existing diversity of IF proteins remain an enigma as much as the functions of IFs themselves. Analyses of animal and human mutations affecting IFs have in the recent years brought some insight into general and specific functions of IFs, at least in some cell types. Keratin IFs in the epithelial cells constituting the epidermis have been shown to confer mechanical resistance to the skin, and a number of mutations affecting keratin genes and preventing proper assembly of IFs have been shown to be associated with human skin blistering diseases. Thus, mutations affecting K5 or K14, the keratin pair expressed in the basal layer of the epidermis, lead to epidermolysis bullosa simplex, and mutations in K1 or K10, the keratins in the adjacent spinous layers, result in epidermolytic hyperkeratosis (1Fuchs E.

We also propose that GFAP and vimentin are required for the proper formation of a glial scar following trauma to the central nervous system (22Pekny M. Johansson C. Eliasson C. Stakeberg J.

Generation of transgenic mouse models lacking one or several IF proteins has proven to be a powerful way to learn more about the functions of IFs in different cell types, and these models have clearly broadened the experimental possibilities available. It has been shown that IFs are often composed of two or more IF proteins, which co-polymerize with each other. For example, IF formation in epithelial cells requires the co-polymerization of two types of keratins, one basic and one acidic (5Fuchs E. Annu. Rev. Cell Devel. Biol. 1995; 11: 123-153Crossref Google Scholar). Similarly, experiments performed with non-neuronal IF-free cell lines transfected with expression vectors for individual neurofilament proteins (NF-L, NF-M, or NF-H), or experiment with transgenic mice have demonstrated the need for specific partnerships in the assembly of IFs; NF-L/NF-M or NF-L/NF-H co-expression both led to IF formation, while homopolymeric assembly of any single neurofilament protein or NF-M/NF-H co-assembly did not result in IF formation (23Ching G.Y.

Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 1337-1350Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). It remains to be established whether a co-polymerization of different IF proteins is a more general prerequisite in IF formation. By crossing GFAP-deficient mice (25Pekny M. Levéen P. Pekna M. Eliasson C. Berthold C.-H. Westermark B. Betsholtz C. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1590-1598Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar) with vimentin-deficient mice (26Colucci-Guyon E. Portier M.M. Dunia I. Paulin D. Pournin S. Babinet C. Cell. 1994; 79: 679-694Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar), we have now generated mice that lack both GFAP and vimentin. Using these mice, we have studied the impact of the absence of GFAP and/or vimentin on the production of IFs in normal or reactive astrocytes in vivo and in astrocyte cultures and determined the obligatory partnership between GFAP, vimentin, and nestin. All mice used were hybrids between C57BL/6 and 129 mouse strains and they were generated within the same litters to equalize genetic variation between the groups. Mice at postnatal days 1–2 were killed by decapitation, and primary astrocyte-enriched cultures were prepared and maintained as described previously (27Pekny M. Eliasson C. Chien C.-L. Kindblom L.G. Liem R. Hamberger A. Betsholtz C. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 239: 332-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Mouse brains were fixed in Bouin's fixative (75 ml of saturated picric acid, 5 ml of glacial acetic acid, 25 ml of 40% formaldehyde), paraffin-embedded, and serially sectioned in the frontal plane. Selected sections were stained with hematoxylin and erythrosin or processed for immunohistochemistry. Pretreatment of the sections and immunohistochemical staining for GFAP and vimentin was performed as described elsewhere (25Pekny M. Levéen P. Pekna M. Eliasson C. Berthold C.-H. Westermark B. Betsholtz C. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1590-1598Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). For nestin immunostaining, slides were incubated with nestin rabbit antiserum (a kind gift from Dr. U. Lendahl, Karolinska Institute, Stockholm, Sweden), then with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat antiserum against rabbit immunoglobulins (Dako A/S), and processed further for 3′-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride staining as described previously (25Pekny M.

For immunocytochemical detection of IF proteins, sparse astrocyte cultures 5 days following plating grown on 30-mm glass discs were used. Immunostaining for GFAP and vimentin with 3′-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride detection was performed as described in Ref. 27Pekny M. Eliasson C. Chien C.-L. Kindblom L.G. Liem R. Hamberger A.

Cell Res. 1998; 239: 332-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar; for nestin immunodetection, polyclonal rabbit antibody (nestin antiserum 6, described below) was used with the consecutive steps performed as described in Ref. 27Pekny M.

For the ultrastructural studies in vivo, 2 wild type, 2 GFAP−/−, 2 vimentin−/−, and 2 GFAP−/−vim−/− mice were used. The mice were anesthetized with Avertin intraperitoneally. After a vascular rinse with 100 ml of Tyrode's solution through the left ventricle, the mice were perfused with a mixture of 2% paraformaldehyde and 2% glutaraldehyde dissolved in isotonic phosphate buffer. Each animal received 250 ml of the fixative infused over a period of 20 min. The brains were removed, and 500-μm-thick slices were cut from the corpus callosum, hippocampus, or cervical spinal cord. The slices were postfixed over night at 6 °C, osmicated for 4 h, dehydrated in a graded series of acetone, and embedded in Vestopal W (Fluka Chemie, Liechtenstein). Sections (80 μm thick) were cut on an LKB Ultrotome, picked up on Formvar-coated one-hole copper grids, contrasted first with uranyl acetate and then with lead citrate, and examined in a Philips EM 400 electron microscope. For the ultrastructural evaluation of IFs in vitro, 10-day-old primary astrocytic cultures were used. Medium was removed, and the cultures in 24-well Falcon plates were rinsed three times with isotonic phosphate buffer. The wells were filled with the fixative consisting of a mixture of 2% paraformaldehyde and 2% glutaraldehyde dissolved in an isotonic phosphate buffer. The cultures were kept in the fixative overnight at 6 °C, osmicated for 2 h, treated en bloc for 2 h with 2% uranyl acetate dissolved in 50% ethanol in water, dehydrated in a graded series of ethanol, and embedded, still in the wells, in Epon. After polymerization, the specimens were freed from the wells and sectioned as described above. The quantitative evaluation of the density of IFs was performed on electron micrographs (magnification, ×100,000). An IF bundle was defined as more than three IFs running in parallel with a distance of less than 40 nm between them. The number of IFs in transversally sectioned IFs bundles was determined in wild type and vimentin−/− astrocytes in vivo by counting the IFs inside randomly placed circles (radius of 1 or 2 cm corresponding to 100–200 nm). The distance between individual IFs in longitudinally sectioned IF bundles was determined in wild type and vimentin−/− astrocytes both in vivo and in vitro. The distance was calculated by subtracting the thickness of IFs within the bundle (n× 10 nm) from the width of the bundle and dividing this number by n − 1 (the number of IFs within the bundle diminished by 1), i.e. the formula was: the distance between IFs = (bundle width − 10 n)/n − 1. Anesthetized animals were wounded by the introduction of a 27-gauge fine needle through the skull and the frontal brain cortex as described previously (25Pekny M. Levéen P. Pekna M. Eliasson C. Berthold C.-H. Westermark B. Betsholtz C. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1590-1598Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). The animals were killed 3, 4, 7, or 14 days after the injury; brains were carefully dissected out of the skull, fixed in Bouin's fixative, and processed for histology and immunohistochemistry. Primary astrocyte-enriched cultures were prepared from wild type (3 mice), GFAP−/−vim+/+ (2 mice), GFAP−/−vim+/− (3 mice), vim−/−GFAP+/− (2 mice), and GFAP−/−vim−/− (3 mice) as described above. The cultures were used 10 days following plating on 10-cm Falcon plates, and they were in the exponential phase of their growth as determined by cell count in parallel cultures. Whole cell extracts were prepared by lysing cells in SDS-lysis buffer (20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.2, 5 mm EGTA, 5 mm EDTA, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1% SDS, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mg/ml antipain, 10 mg/ml leupeptin, and 10 mg/ml pepstatin). Cells were harvested by scraping, boiled for 2–5 min, and sonicated for 15 s with a probe sonicator. Proteins were separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gels (SDS-PAGE; Ref. 28Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207231) Google Scholar). Gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue to control for equal loading. For quantitative Western immunoblotting, protein samples were transferred from gels to nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schuell) using a Bio-Rad semidry transfer apparatus. Cytoskeletal proteins were detected using monoclonal antibodies against actin (N350, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and GFAP (691102, ICN). For vimentin detection a polyclonal rabbit vimentin antibody 264 (29Chou Y.H. Rosevear E. Goldman R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 1885-1889Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) was used. Nestin was detected using a polyclonal rabbit antibody (nestin antiserum 6) raised against a nestin fusion protein according to a previously described protocol (30Tohyama T. Lee V.M. Rorke L.B. Marvin M. McKay D. Trojanowski J.Q. Lab. Invest. 1992; 66: 303-313PubMed Google Scholar). When tested with Western blotting, nestin antiserum 6 recognized specifically the nestin fusion protein and the 220-kDa nestin band in whole cell extract of ST15A cells. The nestin immunoreactivity pattern was identical with that observed with the previously described nestin antiserum 130 (30Tohyama T. Lee V.M. Rorke L.B. Marvin M. McKay D. Trojanowski J.Q. Lab. Invest. 1992; 66: 303-313PubMed Google Scholar). Secondary antibodies used for immunoblotting were peroxidase-labeled sheep anti-mouse immunoglobulins (NA 931, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and peroxidase-labeled donkey anti-rabbit immunoglobulins (W401B, Promega). The binding of antibodies to proteins was visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence using an ECL Western blotting detection kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The relative intensities of the protein bands on immunoblots were analyzed by computer-assisted video-based densitometry. Statistical analysis of the relative intensities was performed by one-way analysis of variance, followed by Newman-Keuls multiple comparison test by using the Prism program package (GraphPad Software, Inc.). Primary astrocyte cultures grown in 25-cm2 flasks were labeled for 14 h with [35S]methionine in 2 ml of modified Eagle's medium lacking methionine and containing 2% dialyzed (against 0.95% NaCl) fetal calf serum and 250 μCi of [35S]methionine (SJ 204, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). At the end of the labeling period, the monolayers were resuspended in 0.4 ml of lysis solution (31Celis J.E. Ratz G. Basse B. Lauridsen J.B. Celis A. Jensen N.A. Gromov P. Celis J.E. Carter N. Hunter T. Shotton D. Simons K. Small J.V. Cell Biology: A Laboratory Handbook. 4. Academic Press, Orlando, FL1997: 375-385Google Scholar) and 20 μl applied to the first dimension gel. Cultures of astrocytes or human ear fibroblasts were labeled with [32P]orthophosphate as described previously (32Rasmussen H.H. Celis J.E. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1993; 101: 560-566Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Following [35S]methionine labeling, the cultures were washed with Hanks' buffered saline and treated for 90 s with 0.1% Triton X-100 in the same buffer. After washing with Hanks' solution, the cytoskeletal fraction was resuspended in the lysis buffer (31Celis J.E. Ratz G. Basse B. Lauridsen J.B. Celis A. Jensen N.A. Gromov P. Celis J.E. Carter N. Hunter T. Shotton D. Simons K. Small J.V. Cell Biology: A Laboratory Handbook. 4. Academic Press, Orlando, FL1997: 375-385Google Scholar). Two-dimensional PAGE was carried out according to Ref. 31Celis J.E. Ratz G. Basse B. Lauridsen J.B. Celis A. Jensen N.A. Gromov P. Celis J.E. Carter N. Hunter T. Shotton D. Simons K. Small J.V.

Total RNA was prepared from wild type, GFAP−/−, vimentin−/−, and GFAP−/−vim−/− primary astrocyte cultures using the LiCl/urea method (33Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning. A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) and processed on formaldehyde gels according to standard protocols. The murine nestin cDNA (a gift from Dr. Martha Marvin, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD) was labeled using [32P]dCTP and the Megaprime labeling kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The nestin mRNA was detected and quantified using a Storm 820 PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). Using two different vimentin antibodies, immunohistochemical examination of the presence of GFAP and vimentin was performed on brain sections covering two areas that normally contain astrocytes strongly positive for these IF proteins: corpus callosum and hippocampus. In the corpus callosum of wild type mice, three cell types could be distinguished that were vimentin-positive: astrocytes, endothelial cells of brain capillaries, and ependymal cells (Fig. 1 a). Vimentin immunoreactivity (IR) was lost in astrocytes of the corpus callosum in GFAP−/− mice, while both endothelial and ependymal cells remained vimentin-positive (Fig. 1 c). A similar loss of vimentin-IR was found in the hippocampus of GFAP−/− mice (Fig. 1, e and g). We have previously shown that the hippocampus of GFAP−/− mice contains a normal number of astrocytes (25Pekny M. Levéen P. Pekna M. Eliasson C. Berthold C.-H. Westermark B. Betsholtz C. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1590-1598Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Thus, the loss of vimentin-positive cells in this region does not reflect a loss of astrocytes. Ultrastructural examination of astrocytes showed complete lack of IFs in corpus callosum and hippocampus in GFAP−/− mice (Fig. 2, b and d), while IFs were readily identified in astrocytes in the same locations in wild type mice (Fig. 2, a and c).Figure 2Electron micrographs of astrocytes in situ. a, b, and e, corpus callosum; c, d, and f, hippocampus, concave aspect of dentate gyrus.

Ultrastructurally, however, vimentin−/− astrocytes at these locations exhibited bundles of IFs that were consistently more condensed than in the wild type mice (Fig. 2, e and f). This compact appearance of the bundles of IFs was also observed in the astrocytes of the white matter of the spinal cord of vimentin−/− mice (compare with normal IFs in wild type mice and with the absence of IFs in GFAP−/− or GFAP−/−vim−/− mice; Fig. 2, g–j). Quantitative comparison between wild type and vimentin−/− astrocytes performed in the white matter of the spinal cord revealed that in vimentin−/− astrocytes the number of IFs per area within a bundle was increased on average to 155% with the distance between individual IFs being reduced by 58% (Fig. 3, TableI).Table IQuantitative comparison of the density of IFs within IF bundles in wild type and vim−/− astrocytesGenotype1-aWT, wild type.No. of areas analyzedMean ± S.E.Range of valuesSignificanceIntact CNS No. of IFs/0.1 μm2WT18215 ± 8165–258p < 0.0001 (cross-section)vim−/−17334 ± 7282–385 Distance between IFsWT1511.8 ± 0.59–17p < 0.0001 within a bundle (nm)vim−/−134.9 ± 0.33–8Primary culturesWT1110.9 ± 1.57–22p < 0.0001 Distance between IFs within a bundle (nm)vim−/−133.4 ± 0.51–7The density of IFs in IF bundles of astrocytes in intact CNS or in primary cultured cells was calculated as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Absence of vimentin correlates with an increased density of IFs within IF bundles measured either as a number of IFs per area within an IF bundle (on the cross-section), or as an average distance between individual IFs (see also Fig. 3).1-a WT, wild type.

Primary astrocytes in culture produce GFAP, vimentin and nestin. Since vimentin-IR was lost in GFAP−/− astrocytes, we used primary cultured cells to address the issue of IF protein levels. We have previously reported that such cultures of astrocytes prepared from wild type and GFAP−/− mice exhibit normal patterns of immunoreactivity using vimentin or nestin antibodies, although, at the ultrastructural level, GFAP−/− astrocytes contained reduced numbers of IFs (27Pekny M. Eliasson C. Chien C.-L. Kindblom L.G. Liem R. Hamberger A. Betsholtz C. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 239: 332-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). To find out whether vimentin or nestin production were influenced quantitatively by the absence of GFAP, we compared the levels of the two IF proteins in primary astrocyte-enriched cultures prepared from wild type or GFAP−/− mice. Western blot analysis from exponentially growing cultures showed that neither vimentin nor nestin levels were altered in the absence of GFAP (Fig. 4). Phosphorylation is the major mechanism regulating the assembly and disassembly of IFs. To compare vimentin phosphorylation in wild type and GFAP−/− astrocytes, we have performed 32P labeling of primary cultures followed by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. As shown in Fig. 5, no differences were detected in vimentin phosphorylation between wild type and GFAP−/− astrocytes (Fig. 5, A and B). As expected, no phosphorylated vimentin was found in vimentin−/− or GFAP−/−vim−/− astrocytes (Fig. 5, C and D). A comparison between mouse astrocytes and human fibroblasts showed that the pools of phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated vimentin in two cell types are of a comparable size (Fig. 6, A–D).Figure 6Isoelectric focusing two-dimensional PAGE of [35S]methionine-labeled proteins from mouse astrocytes and human fibroblasts.

https://openalex.org/W2007919022,"The tight relationship between oxygen and iron prompted us to investigate whether the expression of transferrin receptor (TfR), which mediates cellular iron uptake, is regulated by hypoxia. In Hep3B human hepatoma cells incubated in 1% O2 or treated with CoCl2, which mimics hypoxia, we detected a 3-fold increase of TfR mRNA despite a decrease of iron regulatory proteins activity. Increased expression resulted from a 4-fold stimulation of the nuclear transcription rate of the TfR gene by both hypoxia and CoCl2. A role for hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF-1), which activates transcription by binding to hypoxia-responsive elements in the activation of TfR, stems from the following observations. (a) Hypoxia and CoCl2-dependent expression of luciferase reporter gene in transiently transfected Hep3B cells was mediated by a fragment of the human TfR promoter containing a putative hypoxia-responsive element sequence, (b) mutation of this sequence prevented hypoxic stimulation of luciferase activity, (c) binding to this sequence of HIF-1α, identified by competition experiments and supershift assays, was induced in Hep3B cells by hypoxia and CoCl2. In erythroid K562 cells, the same treatments did not affect iron regulatory proteins activity, thus resulting in a stimulation of TfR gene expression higher than in hepatoma cells.

Klausner R.D. Feige U. Morimoto R.I. Yahara I. Polla B. Stress-inducible Cellular Responses. Birkhauser Verlag, Basel, Switzerland1996: 183-197Crossref Google Scholar). Thus, iron is usually bound to proteins, and iron homeostasis is tightly regulated. Iron in serum is mainly transported by transferrin (Tf),1 which delivers the metal to cells requiring it. Iron-laden Tf interacts with transferrin receptor (TfR), and the complex is then internalized by receptor-mediated endocytosis. Since the TfR plays a crucial role in the control of iron entry into cells, its expression is tightly regulated. Iron controls TfR mRNA levels through a well characterized post-transcriptional mechanism involving binding of cytosolic iron regulatory proteins (IRPs) to iron-responsive elements (IREs) in the 3′-untranslated region of TfR mRNA (2Klausner R.D. Rouault T.A. Harford J.B. Cell. 1993; 72: 19-28Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1053) Google Scholar, 3Hentze M.W. Kuhn L.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8175-8182Crossref PubMed Scopus (1132) Google Scholar). In conditions of iron depletion, IRP actively binds to IREs and increases TfR mRNA stability by preventing access to ribonucleases (2Klausner R.D. Rouault T.A. Harford J.B. Cell. 1993; 72: 19-28Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1053) Google Scholar, 3Hentze M.W. Kuhn L.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8175-8182Crossref PubMed Scopus (1132) Google Scholar). Since, at the same time, the IRE-IRP interaction prevents ferritin mRNA translation, the combined effect of this regulation results in increased iron availability in the intracellular pool. An inverse regulation occurs when iron is plentiful in such a way that iron homeostasis is maintained. On the other hand, iron-independent TfR expression is mainly controlled at the transcriptional level (4Testa U. Pelosi E. Peschle C. Crit. Rev. Oncog. 1993; 4: 241-276PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed, elevated transcription is an important means to provide high TfR expression in erythroid (5Ponka P. Blood. 1997; 89: 1-25Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and mitogen-activated (6Neckers L.M. Pathobiology. 1991; 59: 11-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 7Hirsch S. Miskimins W.K. Cell Growth Differ. 1995; 6: 719-726PubMed Google Scholar) cells. Hypoxia is increasingly recognized as an important regulator of gene expression, and a number of physiologically relevant genes have been found to be induced by hypoxic conditions that may help the cell to adapt to reduced oxygen supply (8Bunn H.F. Poyton R.O. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 839-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (1045) Google Scholar, 9Morwenna Wood S. Ratcliffe P.J. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1997; 29: 1419-1432Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 10Wenger R.H. Gassmann M. Biol. Chem. 1997; 378: 609-616PubMed Google Scholar, 11Semenza G.L. J. Lab. Clin. Med. 1998; 131: 207-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Although post-transcriptional mechanisms may contribute to the induction of hypoxia-sensitive genes, hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF-1), which activates gene transcription in response to reduced oxygen concentration, is the most relevant component of the molecular response to hypoxia. HIF-1 is a heterodimer consisting of an α and β subunit; the latter is identical to the aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator (ARNT), which is also able to dimerize with the aryl hydrocarbon receptor. Hypoxia results in the stabilization of HIF-1α, enabling it, upon dimerization with the constitutively expressed ARNT and formation of a complex with the transcriptional coactivator p300/CBP, to bind hypoxia-responsive elements (HREs) in responsive genes. Hypoxia stimulates erythropoiesis and intestinal iron absorption (12Debnam E.S. Srai S.K.S. News Physiol. Sci. 1997; 12: 184-189Google Scholar), and it is therefore conceivable that proteins involved in iron transport and uptake are regulated by oxygen supply. Indeed, serum Tf levels increase in animals exposed to hypoxia (13Simpson R.J. J. Nutr. 1996; 126: 1858-1864PubMed Google Scholar), and it has been recently shown that Tf gene expression is induced by hypoxia in hepatoma cells (14Rolfs A. Kvietikova I. Gassmann M. Wenger R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20055-20062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). However, for efficient erythropoiesis, transferrin must be iron-loaded and internalized through interaction of Tf with TfR, and hence, the increased plasma iron transport capacity provided by hypoxic up-regulation of Tf expression (14Rolfs A. Kvietikova I. Gassmann M. Wenger R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20055-20062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar) should be followed by increased availability of cellular Tf binding sites. Here we show that TfR gene transcription is stimulated by hypoxia and that a HIF-1 binding site in the TfR promoter is involved in this response. Cell-specific modulation of IRP activity, by allegedly regulating TfR mRNA stability, possibly represents an additional level of control. Hep3B hepatoma cells were grown in minimal essential medium and K562 human erythroleukemia cells in RPMI 1640. Media were supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 2 mml-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin. Cell lines were maintained in a humidified incubator at 37 °C in 5% CO2, 95% air. For hypoxic stimulation, cells at 90% confluency were placed in an incubator chamber that was thoroughly flushed with a gas mixture containing 5% CO2, 1% O2 and nitrogen-balanced, tightly sealed, and incubated at 37 °C for different time periods as described (15Semenza G.L. Roth P.H. Fang H-M. Wang G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23757-23763Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The pH of the culture medium did not change after 20 h of hypoxia. Cells were also exposed to 100 μm CoCl2 or 100 μmdesferrioxamine (Sigma) for different time periods. Total cellular RNA was isolated as described (16Tacchini L. Recalcati S. Bernelli-Zazzera A. Cairo G. Gastroenterology. 1997; 113: 946-953Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), and equal amounts of RNA were electrophoresed under denaturing conditions. To confirm that each lane contained equal amounts of total RNA, the ribosomal RNA content in each lane was estimated in the ethidium bromide-stained gels by laser densitometry. RNA was transferred to Hybond-N filters (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), which were hybridized with 32P-labeled human TfR cDNA pTR10 (17Pietrangelo A. Rocchi E. Casalgrandi G. Rigo G. Ferrari A. Perini M. Ventura E. Cairo G. Gastroenterology. 1992; 102: 802-809Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Quantitative determination was achieved by direct nuclear counting using an InstantImager (Packard Instruments Co.), and the values were calculated after normalization to the amount of ribosomal RNA. Nuclei were purified and incubated for in vitro transcription as described (18Cairo G. Tacchini L. Pogliaghi G. Anzon E. Tomasi A. Bernelli-Zazzera A. J. Biol.

Hybridization signals were evaluated by direct nuclear counting using an InstantImager and normalized to the values of L-ferritin subunit after subtraction of the background values represented by the hybridization signals of the empty plasmid pGEM (Promega, Milano, Italy). The pSPT-fer plasmid containing the iron-responsive element of human ferritin H chain (21Mullner E.W. Neupert B. Kuhn L.C. Cell. 1989; 58: 373-382Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar) was linearized with Bam HI and transcribed in vitro with T7 RNA polymerase in the presence of 100 μCi of [α-32P]UTP (800 Ci/mmol, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Cells were homogenized in the buffer described by Leibold and Munro (22Leibold E.A. Munro H.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 2171-2175Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar), the lysate was centrifuged at 16,000 × g, and the supernatant was used for an RNA-protein band shift assay. Samples containing 2 μg of protein (determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay kit) were incubated in the absence or presence of 2% 2-mercaptoethanol, with a molar excess of IRE probe. Incubation, digestion with RNase T1, and treatment with heparin were performed as previously described (23Cairo G. Castrusini E. Minotti G. Bernelli-Zazzera A. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 1326-1335Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). After separation on 6% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels, RNA-protein complexes were visualized by autoradiography and quantitated by direct nuclear counting using an InstantImager. To construct the pTfRA-luc vector, a 1710-bp Eco RI-Eco RV fragment excised from plasmid pAT153-E5.E5 (24Kuhn L.C. McLelland A. Ruddle F.H. Cell. 1984; 37: 95-103Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) was filled and inserted into the Sma I site of the pGL2 vector (Promega, Milano, Italy). To obtain the pTfRB-luc clone, a 455-bp fragment was amplified from the No. 9 derivative of plasmid pcD-TR1 (25Owen D. Kuhn L.C. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 1287-1293Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar) using oligonucleotides corresponding to positions -439 to -424 and +2 to +16 as 5′ and 3′ primers, respectively. The amplified product was blunted and inserted into the Sma I site of the pGL2 vector (Promega, Milano, Italy). Mutation of the putative HRE sequence 5′-TACGTGC-3′ centered at position -86 in the sense DNA strand of the pTfRB-luc plasmid with replacement of the bases TACGT with AATTC to construct pTfRBm-luc was introduced by polymerase chain reaction-based site-directed mutagenesis using the ExSite mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, Milano, Italy). All constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. Subconfluent Hep3B cells were transiently cotransfected using the calcium phosphate method with 10 μg of a 50:1 mixture of pGL2 constructions and pRL-SV40 reporter vector containing Renilla luciferase, which was used to normalize for transfection efficiency. After recovering for 48 h, the cells were subjected to the various treatments. Cells were collected, washed, and lysed using the reporter lysis buffer (Promega, Milano, Italy). Luciferase activities were then measured in a Lumat LB 9501 luminometer (Berthold) using the dual-luciferase reporter assay system (Promega, Milano, Italy) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The HRE sequence was synthesized to match W18 in Wang and Semenza (26Wang G.L. Semenza G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1230-1237Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1729) Google Scholar). The TfR-18 oligonucleotide corresponding to sequences from nucleotide position -93 to -75 relative to the transcription start site in the human TfR gene (AGCGTACGTG C CTCAGGA) was labeled with [γ-32P]ATP by means of T4 polynucleotide kinase. Hep3B nuclear extract (10 μg of protein) prepared as described (26Wang G.L. Semenza G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1230-1237Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1729) Google Scholar) was preincubated in 10 mm Tris, pH 7.8, 50 mmNaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 5% (v/v) glycerol, 5 mmdithiothreitol, and 20 μg/ml poly(dI·dC) for 5 min at room temperature before the addition of 0.5 ng of labeled probe. For supershift assay, 1 μg of OZ15 monoclonal antibody to HIF-1α (NeoMarkers, Union City, CA) was added, and the binding reaction mixture was incubated at 4 °C for 90 min. After 20 min at room temperature, reaction products were electrophoresed at 4 °C in 5% polyacrylamide in 30 mm Tris, 30 mm boric acid, 0.06 mm EDTA. TfR expression in response to hypoxia was studied in a line of hepatoma cells that is extensively used to investigate regulation of genes associated to hypoxic stress. Northern blot analysis (Fig. 1) showed that incubation of Hep3B cells in reduced oxygen atmosphere (1% O2) for 20 h strongly increased TfR mRNA steady state levels. Quantification of four experiments showed a 3-fold induction. Treatment with CoCl2, a well known inducer of several hypoxia-responsive genes (8Bunn H.F. Poyton R.O. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 839-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (1045) Google Scholar, 9Morwenna Wood S. Ratcliffe P.J. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1997; 29: 1419-1432Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 10Wenger R.H. Gassmann M. Biol. Chem. 1997; 378: 609-616PubMed Google Scholar, 11Semenza G.L. J. Lab. Clin. Med. 1998; 131: 207-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar), also increased TfR mRNA expression to a similar extent. Since TfR is known to be regulated at post-transcriptional level by the IRE-IRP interaction (2Klausner R.D. Rouault T.A. Harford J.B. Cell. 1993; 72: 19-28Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1053) Google Scholar,3Hentze M.W. Kuhn L.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8175-8182Crossref PubMed Scopus (1132) Google Scholar), we investigated the IRE binding activity of IRP by RNA bandshift assays in cytosolic extracts of Hep3B cells. Fig.2 demonstrates that IRP activity in human hepatoma cells was up-regulated by iron chelation, as expected on the basis of previous work (2Klausner R.D. Rouault T.A. Harford J.B. Cell. 1993; 72: 19-28Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1053) Google Scholar, 3Hentze M.W. Kuhn L.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8175-8182Crossref PubMed Scopus (1132) Google Scholar), and markedly repressed (70% inactivation, as revealed by quantification of three separate experiments) by both hypoxic exposure and treatment with CoCl2 for 20 h, as previously shown for rat hepatoma cells (27Hanson E.S. Leibold E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7588-7593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Treatment of cell extracts with 2-mercaptoethanol, which fully activates latent IRP (2Klausner R.D. Rouault T.A. Harford J.B. Cell. 1993; 72: 19-28Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1053) Google Scholar, 3Hentze M.W. Kuhn L.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8175-8182Crossref PubMed Scopus (1132) Google Scholar), eliminated all the differences, thus indicating equal loading of all samples and suggesting that inactivation was due to a post-translational switch. Experiments with murine cells in which, at a difference from human cells, separation and detection of IRP-1 versus IRP-2 by bandshift assays is possible, demonstrated that the two IRPs are divergently regulated by hypoxia (27Hanson E.S. Leibold E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7588-7593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 28Hanson E.S. Foot L.M. Leibold E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5047-5052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). We cannot specify the role of the two IRP isoforms in hypoxic human hepatoma cells; nevertheless, as IRP-1 and IRP-2 bind IREs with similar affinity and specificity (2Klausner R.D. Rouault T.A. Harford J.B. Cell. 1993; 72: 19-28Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1053) Google Scholar, 3Hentze M.W. Kuhn L.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8175-8182Crossref PubMed Scopus (1132) Google Scholar, 29Henderson B.R. Bioessays. 1996; 18: 739-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), a decrease of TfR mRNA stability should reflect the observed reduction of total IRP binding activity. The increase of TfR mRNA levels in the presence of reduced IRP activity pointed to a transcriptional effect on TfR expression. To directly assess this aspect, we measured TfR gene transcription in isolated nuclei. Fig.3 shows that the transcription rate of TfR gene is stimulated by both hypoxia and CoCl2 with a response similar to that of the heme oxygenase gene, which has been shown to be transcriptionally activated by hypoxia (30Lee P.J. Jiang B-H. Chin B.Y. Iyer N.V. Alam J. Semenza G.L. Choi A.M.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5375-5381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar). On the other hand, transcription of the gene for ferritin L subunit was not altered by these treatments. Quantification of three separate experiments showed a 4-fold induction of TfR gene transcription. We then analyzed the structure of the TfR gene to determine whether any consensus HREs were present that might account for our observations of hypoxic induction of TfR gene transcription. Search for potential binding sites in the promoter region extending 1.7 kilobases upstream of the initiation site with the MatInspector V2.2 program revealed two binding sites matching the consensus for AHR/ARNT (NGCGTGA/C) and two binding sites for HIF-1α/ARNT (TACGTGC), one on the sense and another on the antisense strand. To further clarify the role of transcriptional activation in hypoxia-mediated TfR gene expression, a 1710-bp fragment of the human TfR promoter region was cloned in front of luciferase, and the resulting construct (pTfRA-luc) was transiently transfected in Hep3B cells (Fig. 4 A). As indicated by previous evidence showing that less than 200 bp of 5′ region are sufficient for expression of the TfR gene (24Kuhn L.C. McLelland A. Ruddle F.H. Cell. 1984; 37: 95-103Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), the cloned fragment was sufficient for efficient transcription of the promoterless reporter gene in transfected normoxic cells, as demonstrated by a several hundred-fold induction of basal luciferase activity over that of the empty pGL2 Basic vector. Exposure to hypoxia for 20 h stimulated luciferase expression 2.5-fold, as revealed by quantification of 3 experiments (Fig. 4 B). Treatment with CoCl2 induced a slightly stronger response. No elevation was observed after a similar induction of cells transfected with the control pGL2 DNA. To better define the promoter region that confers oxygen responsiveness to TfR, we focused on a shorter region containing the sequence −90 to −83 relative to the transcription start site on the sense strand (5′-TACGTGC-3′), which matches consensus HREs and that is positioned 15 bases upstream of a CACA repeat, which seems to be necessary for hypoxic inducibility (8Bunn H.F. Poyton R.O. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 839-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (1045) Google Scholar). A 455-bp fragment (pTfRB-luc) was used for transfection and reporter gene assays, and its activity was compared with that of a similar construct (pTfRBm-luc) in which the HRE sequence on the sense strand had been mutated (Fig. 4 A). This shorter fragment conserved high basal transcription efficiency and was still able to confer hypoxic inducibility of luciferase activity to an extent similar to that previously observed with the longer construct (Fig. 4 B). In agreement with the observation that the HIF-1/HRE interaction is important for basal transcription levels of hypoxia-inducible genes also under normoxic conditions (31Zelzer E. Levy Y. Kahana C. Shilo B-Z. Rubinstein M. Cohen B. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5085-5094Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar), the mutation somewhat decreased the basal levels of pTfRBm-luc reporter activity (data not shown), but importantly, also prevented almost completely the hypoxia-stimulated increase of luciferase activity (Fig.4 B), thus suggesting that this sequence is a functional HRE in the response of TfR to hypoxia. To assess whether the sequence found in the TfR gene promoter with high homology to consensus HRE was the target of HIF-1, nuclear extracts were analyzed by electrophoretic mobility shift assays. Fig.5, panel A shows that the TfR-18 probe detected a constitutively expressed DNA binding activity (C) as well as a DNA binding activity (HIF-1) present in hypoxic and CoCl2-treated cells (lanes 2 and 3) and absent in nonhypoxic cells (lane 1). The specificity of the interaction between the probe and hypoxia-induced factors was tested by competition with nonradioactive oligonucleotides. Inclusion of increasing amounts of unlabeled TfR-18 oligonucleotides (lanes 4–6) inhibited the binding of the constitutive and inducible complexes. Competition with cold oligonucleotides corresponding to the HRE present in the erythropoietin enhancer (W-18, lanes 7–9) suggested that the hypoxia-inducible factor binding the TfR probe was indeed HIF-1. To further determine the composition of the hypoxia and CoCl2-induced complexes, nuclear extracts were incubated with a monoclonal antibody to HIF-1α before the mobility shift assay. Supershift assays (Fig. 5, panel B, lanes 3 and 4) showed that HIF-1α interacts with the HRE sequence of the TfR gene. Erythroid cells rely almost completely on transferrin-bound iron for hemoglobin synthesis and therefore express TfR at high levels (5Ponka P. Blood. 1997; 89: 1-25Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, to investigate whether hypoxic stimulation of TfR expression was extended to erythroid cells, we subjected K562 cells to hypoxic and CoCl2treatment. Northern blot analysis demonstrated a marked up-regulation of the TfR transcript not only in desferrioxamine-treated K562 cells, as expected, but also in hypoxic and CoCl2-treated cells, (Fig. 6, panel A). Indeed, quantification of three different experiments showed that TfR gene expression was stimulated 8-fold in hypoxic versus normoxic cells, i.e. to a greater extent than in hepatoma cells (see Fig. 1). Interestingly, RNA bandshift assays (Fig. 6, panel B) demonstrated that in erythroid cells, IRP activity was stimulated by desferrioxamine but not affected by hypoxia. These findings suggest therefore that in these cells the increased transcription of TfR gene was not counteracted by the decreased mRNA stability, which should be the result of down-regulation of IRP activity, thus resulting in higher accumulation of TfR mRNA. Results reported in the present paper add TfR to the growing list of hypoxia-inducible genes and thus strengthen the link between iron metabolism and oxygen homeostasis. In fact, all the major genes of iron metabolism respond to hypoxia. Although IRP-1 and IRP-2 modulation under hypoxic conditions is determined at a post-translational level (27Hanson E.S. Leibold E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7588-7593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 28Hanson E.S. Foot L.M. Leibold E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5047-5052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), and ferritin induction is post-transcriptionally controlled as a result of IRP inactivation (32Kuriyama-Matsumura K. Sato H. Yamaguchi M. Bannai S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 249: 241-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 33Qi Y. Dawson G. J. Neurochem. 1994; 63: 1485-1490Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), the expression of Tf (14Rolfs A. Kvietikova I. Gassmann M. Wenger R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20055-20062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar) and TfR (present study) is transcriptionally regulated. It is evident that there is post-transcriptional regulation of TfR expression via IRP-mediated control of mRNA stability in response to iron (2Klausner R.D. Rouault T.A. Harford J.B. Cell. 1993; 72: 19-28Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1053) Google Scholar, 3Hentze M.W. Kuhn L.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8175-8182Crossref PubMed Scopus (1132) Google Scholar) and other stimuli (34Cairo G. Pietrangelo A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6405-6409Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 35Recalcati S. Taramelli D. Conte D. Cairo G. Blood. 1998; 91: 1059-1066Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); however, we provide here results from several lines of investigation to show that hypoxic stimulation of TfR expression is mainly transcriptional. Indeed, run-on experiments demonstrated elevated transcription of the TfR gene in hypoxic and CoCl2-treated cells, which resulted in a rise of steady-state mRNA levels. Transfection experiments provided further evidence for the critical role of transcriptional control in the response of TfR expression to reduced oxygen concentration. We also demonstrated that hypoxia stimulates TfR gene transcription through HIF-1α, the best characterized transcriptional activator of hypoxia-sensitive genes. Indeed, a well conserved HRE sequence is present in the human TfR promoter; moreover, when cells were transfected with constructs in which the putative HRE was mutated to abolish HIF-1 binding, inducibility by hypoxia was lost. Results of supershift assays are also consistent with HIF-1 acting as a transactivating factor in the response of TfR to hypoxia. Indication that the TfR HRE is necessary to confer transcription activation in response to hypoxia and that TfR possesses the main properties shared by HIF-1α-regulated genes (11Semenza G.L. J. Lab. Clin. Med. 1998; 131: 207-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar) is provided by two other types of evidence. (i) The extent of response was similar when luciferase expression was driven by both the 1.7-kilobase- and the 455-bp-long promoters, thus indicating that the latter contained the main regulatory element(s), and (ii) mutation of the HRE around −85 almost completely abolished the response to reduced oxygen concentration, thus indicating the absence of other critical sites within the shorter construct. The present results suggest that in Hep3B cells, transcriptional induction was sufficient to overcome the counteracting effect of decreased IRP activity, which, on the basis of the well known effects of the IRE-IRP interaction on TfR mRNA turnover (2Klausner R.D. Rouault T.A. Harford J.B. Cell. 1993; 72: 19-28Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1053) Google Scholar, 3Hentze M.W. Kuhn L.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8175-8182Crossref PubMed Scopus (1132) Google Scholar), is expected to have decreased TfR mRNA stability. While this study was in preparation, it was reported that the activation of IRP binding capacity induced by hypoxia in Hep3B cells resulted in higher expression of TfR and suppression of ferritin synthesis (36Toth I. Yuan L. Rogers J.T. Boyce H. Bridges K.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4467-4473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). We have no immediate explanation for the discrepancy between our results, which are in agreement with previous evidence of a reduced IRP-1 binding in murine hepatoma cells and macrophages (27Hanson E.S. Leibold E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7588-7593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 28Hanson E.S. Foot L.M. Leibold E.A. J. Biol.

Commun. 1998; 249: 241-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), and those of Toth et al. (36Toth I. Yuan L. Rogers J.T. Boyce H. Bridges K.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4467-4473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). However, with regard to the post-transcriptional control imposed by IRPs, since the two IRPs are regulated oppositely by hypoxia (28Hanson E.S. Foot L.M. Leibold E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5047-5052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) i.e. decreased IRP-1 and increased IRP-2 activity, the discrepancy in the observed total IRP activity (IRP-1 and IRP-2) may depend on the relative abundance of the two forms in a particular cell. In turn, this can be influenced by a variety of parameters, such as iron content of the medium and proliferative status of the cell (37Recalcati S. Conte D. Cairo G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 259: 304-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), which could possibly account for the divergent results obtained in different laboratories using the same cell line. On the other hand, although increased total IRP activity as the result of higher IRP-2 levels is plausible in cells rich in IRP-2, e.g. 293 human kidney cells (28Hanson E.S. Foot L.M. Leibold E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5047-5052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), a similar up-regulation is less likely in Hep3B cells, where the amount of IRP-2 is low (36Toth I. Yuan L. Rogers J.T. Boyce H. Bridges K.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4467-4473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Although hepatoma cells are a convenient system to study hypoxia, the dependence of liver cells on Tf iron is limited. Indeed, hepatic TfR expression is immediately down-regulated by iron overload in patients with hemochromatosis (38Pietrangelo A. Rocchi E. Ferrari A. Ventura E. Cairo G. Hepatology. 1991; 14: 1083-1089Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) who nonetheless accumulate iron from non-transferrin sources (39Aisen P. Semin. Liver Dis. 1984; 4: 193-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). On the other hand, erythroid cells use almost exclusively Tf-bound iron for proliferation and hemoglobin synthesis. It is therefore of interest that in these cells, which are exquisitely sensitive to changes in oxygen supply, hypoxic response of TfR is not only maintained but is even increased compared with that of hepatoma cells. The large accumulation of TfR mRNA is possibly the result of the combination of elevated transcription and unaltered mRNA stability, as inferred on the basis of previous work (2Klausner R.D. Rouault T.A. Harford J.B. Cell. 1993; 72: 19-28Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1053) Google Scholar, 3Hentze M.W. Kuhn L.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8175-8182Crossref PubMed Scopus (1132) Google Scholar) by the lack of changes of IRP activity, although the contribution of a higher transcription rate cannot be excluded. Increased RNA stability is an additional mechanism for the induction of hypoxia-inducible genes (9Morwenna Wood S. Ratcliffe P.J. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1997; 29: 1419-1432Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The results presented here suggest that hypoxia modulates TfR expression at multiple levels in a cell-specific way. Unidirectional activation, through increased transcription and unchanged, IRP-mediated, mRNA stability (discussed above), occurs in erythroid cells, whereas in hepatic cells the two controls are divergent, and reduced IRP activity counteracts in part enhanced transcription, eventually resulting in a smaller rise of TfR mRNA. One can speculate whether this cell-specific response is aimed at providing bone marrow cells with plenty of iron for eythropoiesis while preventing excessive entry of the metal into other cells where free iron could trigger formation of reactive oxygen species during reoxygenation or post-ischemic reperfusion.

Surface plasmon resonance kinetic analysis shows that the CXC chemokine stromal cell-derived factor-1α (SDF-1α), which binds the CXCR4 receptor, associates with heparin with an affinity constant of 38.4 nm (kon = 2.16 × 106m−1 s−1 and koff = 0.083 × s−1).

Honjo T. Science. 1993; 261: 600-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar). Two forms, α and β (68 and 72 amino acids, respectively), generated by alternative splicing from a unique sdf-1 gene, have been identified (4Shirozu M. Nakano T. Inazawa J. Tashiro K. Tada H. Shinohara T. Honjo T. Genomics. 1995; 28: 495-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). The α form is the most abundant (4Shirozu M. Nakano T. Inazawa J. Tashiro K. Tada H. Shinohara T. Honjo T. Genomics. 1995; 28: 495-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar).

Furthermore, the interaction between SDF-1α and CXCR4 appears to be unique and non-promiscuous (5Nagasawa T. Hirota S. Tachibana K. Takakura N. Nishikawa S. Kitamura Y. Yoshida N. Kikutani H.

In contrast to most chemokines, which are induced by cytokines or mitogenic stimuli, SDF-1α is constitutively expressed in a large number of tissues (4Shirozu M. Nakano T. Inazawa J. Tashiro K. Tada H. Shinohara T. Honjo T. Genomics. 1995; 28: 495-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). Importantly, Sdf-1 gene knock-outs induce anomalies in hematopoiesis and the development of cardiovascular system provocating pre- or perinatal death of the embryos (5Nagasawa T. Hirota S. Tachibana K. Takakura N. Nishikawa S. Kitamura Y. Yoshida N. Kikutani H. Kishimoto T. Nature. 1996; 382: 635-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (1999) Google Scholar). Apart from these physiological functions, SDF-1α has the selective capacity to inhibit cell entry of CXCR4-dependent human immunodeficiency viruses by occupying and internalizing CXCR4 in T lymphocytes (8Oberlin E. Amara A. Bachelerie F. Bessia C. Virelizier J.L. Arenzana-Seisdedos F. Schwartz O. Heard J.M. Clark-Lewis I. Legler D.F. Loetscher M. Baggiolini M. Moser B.

Overall, these findings indicate that SDF-1α and its receptor, both of which are expressed widely outside the lympho-hematopoietic system, accomplish important additional functions that are not typical for chemokines. The biological activities of chemokines are thought to be influenced by their association with cellular or extracellular matrix glycosaminoglycans (GAG). Usually attached to a core protein to form proteoglycans (13Iozzo R.V. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 609-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (1335) Google Scholar), GAG are highly sulfated oligosaccharides characterized by a high degree of structural heterogeneity. The common GAG are heparin, heparan sulfate (HS), dermatan sulfate, chondroitin sulfate, and hyaluronic acid (14Kjellen L. Lindahl U. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 443-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (1673) Google Scholar, 15Hardingham T.E. Fosang A.J. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 861-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (1009) Google Scholar). The interaction of cytokines with proteoglycans in the extracellular matrix or cell surface have important functional consequences in many biological systems (16Gordon M.Y. Riley G.P. Watt S.M. Greaves M.F. Nature. 1987; 326: 403-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar, 17Spivak-Kroizman T. Lemmon M.A. Dikic I. Ladbury J.E. Pinchasi D. Huang J. Jaye M. Crumley G. Schlessinger J. Lax I. Cell. 1994; 79: 1015-1024Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar). Although the in vivo biological roles of chemokine-GAG complexes are not clear, an increasing body of evidence suggests that GAG immobilize and enhance local concentrations of the chemokines, promoting their oligomerization and facilitating their presentation to the receptors (18Tanaka Y. Adams D.H. Shaw S. Immunol. Today. 1993; 14: 111-115Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar, 19Hoogewerf A.J. Kuschert G.S. Proudfoot A.E. Borlat F. Clark-Lewis I. Power C.A. Wells T.N. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 13570-13578Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). Thus, it has been proposed that chemokines like macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1β or interleukin-8 (IL-8) would be tethered to circulating leukocytes complexed to membrane-bound proteoglycans in endothelial cells (20Tanaka Y. Adams D.H. Hubscher S. Hirano H. Siebenlist U. Shaw S. Nature. 1993; 361: 79-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (844) Google Scholar, 21Middleton J. Neil S. Wintle J. Clark-Lewis I. Moore H. Lam C. Auer M. Hub E. Rot A. Cell. 1997; 91: 385-395Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar). Although retention of SDF-1α in heparin affinity columns indicates that the chemokine has the capacity to complex with GAG (22Bleul C.C. Fuhlbrigge R.C. Casasnovas J.M. Aiuti A. Springer T.A. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 1101-1109Crossref PubMed Scopus (1275) Google Scholar), it is not known whether SDF-1α is capable to interact with GAG under physiological conditions. Moreover, the nature of GAG is not known, and the structural determinants of the protein that eventually would account for such interactions remain unidentified. The aim of this work was to investigate the capacity of SDF-1α to form complexes with isolated or cell-bound GAG and to characterize the GAG family accounting for these interactions. On the other hand, we wanted to identify structural determinants of SDF-1α involved in the physical contact with GAG. Our findings demonstrate that SDF-1α interacts selectively and with relatively high affinity with HS in vitro. HS is also responsible for the binding of SDF-1α to CXCR4-negative epithelial or endothelial cells. Finally, we identified a cluster of basic residues in the first β-strand of the β-sheet of SDF-1α which is necessary for interaction with HS both in vitro and in intact cells. CHO-K1, CHO-pgsB 618, CHO-pgsD 677, Jurkat, CEM, CEMx174, ECV-304, and HeLa were obtained from the American Type Cell Collection. HS, dermatan sulfate, chondroitin sulfate A, and chondroitin sulfate B were obtained from Sigma (catalogue numbers H5393, C3788, C9819, and C0320, respectively). Heparinase (EC 4.2.2.7), heparitinase I (EC 4.2.2.8), and chondroitinase ABC (EC 4.2.2.4) were purchased from Seikagaku Corp. Heparin was from Sanofi Recherche. An upgraded BIAcore system, F1 sensorchips, amine coupling kit, and HBS (10 mm Hepes, 150 mm NaCl, 3.4 mmEDTA, 0.005% surfactant P20, pH 7.4) were obtained from BiAcore AB. Biotin-LC-hydrazide was from Pierce, and streptavidin was obtained from Sigma. SDF-1α 2-67, 3-67, and, 4-67, regulated on activation normal T cell expressed and secreted (RANTES), and MIP-1α and MIP-1β were a gift from Dr. Ian Clark-Lewis (British Columbia University, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada). Wild type SDF-1α (SDF-1α) and SDF-1 3/6 (substitution of Lys24, His25, and Lys27 by Ser24, Ser25, and Ser27) were synthesized by the Merrifield solid-phase method on a fully automated peptide synthesizer (Pioneer, Perspective Biosystems, and Perkin-Elmer) using fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyl (Fmoc) chemistry. All amino acids were double coupled with O-(7-azabenzotriazol-1-yl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyluroniumhexafluorophosphate/DIEA activation, and piperidine Fmoc deprotection was optimized by elongating the standard deprotection time. After completion of the synthesis, the polypeptide was released from the resin and precipitated in cold diethyl ether. The precipitate was dissolved in aqueous 0.08% trifluoroacetic acid and lyophilized. The crude polypeptide was dissolved in 6 m guanidine hydrochloride, 0.1 mTris acetate, pH 8.5, and 16% 2-mercaptoethanol, stirred at 37 °C for 2 h, and then acidified to pH 4. The reduced chemokine was purified on a preparative medium pressure liquid chromatography column (313 × 26 mm) packed with C18 100-Å and 20-μm Nucleoprep packing (Macherey-Nagel GmbH & Co, Düren, Germany) using a 20–80% linear gradient of acetonitrile in 0.08% aqueous trifluoroacetic acid over 120 min at a 25 ml/min flow rate. After lyophilization, the purified, reduced chemokine was solubilized in 6m guanidine hydrochloride, 0.1 m Tris acetate, pH 8.5, and rapidly diluted into 0.1 m Tris acetate buffer, pH 8.5. Final concentration of the chemokine was 0.4 mg/ml in 1m guanidine hydrochloride, 0.1 m Tris acetate, pH 8.5. The solution was stirred overnight to allow chemokine folding and gentle air oxidation of the four cysteines. The folded chemokine was purified using the medium pressure liquid chromatography purification procedure described above. Final purity of SDF-1α and SDF-1 3/6 was superior to 95% as judged by high pressure liquid chromatography. The average molecular weights determined by ion spray mass spectrometry were 7830.9 ± 0.5 (theoretic molecular weight, 7831.3) for SDF-1α and 7699.0 ± 0.5 (theoretic molecular weight, 7699.0) for SDF-1 3/6. SDF 1–34 was synthesized using the same procedure. Cysteine in position 11 was replaced by alanine. Cyclization of the reduced half-chemokine was done by H2O2at pH 7 (23Kudryavtseva E.V. Sidorova M.V. Ovchinnikov M.V. Bespalova Z.D. Bushuev V.N. J. Pept. Res. 1997; 49: 52-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), and the cyclic peptide was purified under the same conditions as described above. Ion spray mass spectroscopy showed a molecular weight of 3910.8 ± 1 (theoretic molecular weight, 3910.6). The concentration of each chemokine or derivative was determined by amino acid analysis on a 6300 Beckman amino acid analyzer after hydrolysis for 20 h in 6 n HCl, 0.2% phenol in the presence of a known amount of norleucine as internal standard. All chemicals for the synthesis were purchased from Perspective Biosystems and Perkin-Elmer, France. The anti-SDF-1 monoclonal antibody (mAb) K15C (IgG2a κ) was generated by immunizing BALB/c mice with the SDF-1-derived peptide KPVSLSYRSPSRFFC conjugated via cysteine 15 to bovine serum albumin. Fusions were carried out as described previously (24Tanchou V. Delaunay T. Bodeus M. Roques B. Darlix J.L. Benarous R. J. Gen. Virol. 1995; 76: 2457-2466Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). mAb was purified from bulk culture by affinity chromatography on a protein A-Sepharose column. Anti-SDF-1 K15C specificity was evaluated by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Briefly, SDF-1α coated on 96-well plates was incubated for 2 h at 37 °C with K15C mAb (0.05 μg/ml) previously preincubated overnight at 4 °C with various concentrations (10−12 to 10−5m) of SDF-1α or irrelevant chemokines (MIP-1α, MIP-1β, and RANTES) diluted in PBS, 0.1% Tween 20, 0.5% bovine serum albumin. K15C·SDF-1α complexes were revealed with a 5000-fold diluted horseradish peroxidase-labeled goat anti-mouse immunoglobulins G (H + L) (Diagnostic Pasteur, Marnes la Coquettes, France) and ortho-phenylenediamine (Sigma, 2% in 0.05 mphosphate/citrate buffer, pH 5.0) and 0.015% H2O2. The reaction was stopped with 50 μl of 4 m H2SO4, and optical density at 492 nm was measured in a spectrophotometer. K15C mAb specificity was finally investigated by Western blot analysis. Fifty ng of SDF-1α, SDF-1β, or SDF-1α proteins with progressive deletions at the amino terminus (SDF 2–67, SDF 3–67, and SDF 4–67) were separated by electrophoresis on 20% SDS-polyacrylamide gels (PAGE), blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes, and probed with the K15C mAb (1 μg/ml). The binding of the antibody was revealed using an enhanced chemiluminescence assay (ECL kit, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Les Ulis, France). The ability of K15C mAb to block CXCR4 endocytosis induced by SDF-1α was also investigated. Jurkat cells (5 × 105cells/sample) were incubated with 10 nm SDF-1α or 10 nm SDF-1α previously neutralized with either 30 μg/ml K15C mAb or an equal amount of an irrelevant, isotype-matched, mouse immunoglobulin. Down-regulation of CXCR4 expression was evaluated as described previously (11Amara A. Legall S. Schwartz O. Salamero J. Montes M. Loetscher P. Baggiolini M. Virelizier J.L. Arenzana-Seisdedos F. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 139-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar). The anti-CXCR4 6H8 (IgG1κ) mAb used in this work was obtained by immunizing BALB/c mice with a peptide spanning the first 28 amino-terminal amino acids of CXCR4 conjugated via cysteine 28 to ovalbumin (25Mondor I. Moulard M. Ugolini S. Klasse P.J. Hoxie J. Amara A. Delaunay T. Wyatt R. Sodroski J. Sattentau Q.J. Virology. 1998; 248: 394-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). 6H8 was screened by flow cytometry analysis of CEM cells and was shown to bind to human peripheral blood lymphocytes and human cell lines (Jurkat, U937, THP-1, HeLa, and SupT1) that constitutively express CXCR4. 6H8 reacts specifically with CXCR4-transfected CHO-K1 cells but not with CHO-K1 cells transfected with CCR5, CCR3, CCR1, or CCR2b (data not shown). The specificity of CXCR4 detection by 6H8 mAb was compared with that obtained using the well characterized 12G5 anti-CXCR4-mAb. Both antibodies exhibit identical patterns of recognition and specificity for a large panel of human or animal cells expressing CXCR4 constitutively or upon transfection. Adherent cells were plated 2 days before binding experiments. Cells were detached with 2 mm EDTA in PBS and washed twice with ice-cold binding buffer (RPMI 1640, 20 mmHepes, 1% bovine serum albumin). 4 × 105 cells were resuspended in the presence of the indicated concentration of chemokines in a total volume of 200 μl and incubated for 90 min at 4 °C under agitation. Unbound chemokine was removed by washing with binding buffer, and cell-bound SDF-1α was detected by incubation with the anti-SDF-1 mAb K15C (15 μg/ml, diluted in PBS, 1% bovine serum albumin). After staining with phycoerythrin-conjugated anti-mouse immunoglobulins (Southern Biotechnology), cells were fixed in 1% formaldehyde buffer and analyzed in a FACSscan (Becton Dickinson, CA). To remove cell-surface GAG, CHO-K1 and HeLa cells (106cells) were washed twice and incubated for 90 min at 37 °C with 1 milliunit/ml GAG-degrading enzymes. For trypsin treatment, cells were washed once with PBS containing 2 mm EDTA and incubated for 4 min at 37 °C with 0.25% trypsin in PBS. After enzyme treatment, cells were washed four times with 5 ml of binding buffer, detached with PBS/EDTA, and then assayed for SDF-1α binding as described above. Fractionated heparin (9 kDa) resuspended in PBS at 1 mm was reacted for 24 h at room temperature with 10 mm biotin/LC-hydrazine. The mixture was then extensively dialyzed against water to remove unreacted biotin and freeze-dried. Two flow cells of an F1 sensorchip were activated with 50 μl of a mixture of 0.2 m EDC, 0.05 m NHS before injection of 50 μl of streptavidin (0.2 mg/ml in 10 mm acetate buffer, pH 4.2). Remaining activated groups were blocked with 50 μl of 1m ethanolamine, pH 8.5. Typically, this procedure allowed coupling of approximately 2000–2500 resonance units (RU) of streptavidin. Biotinylated heparin (5–10 μg/ml in HBS containing 0.3m NaCl) was then injected on one of the two streptavidin surfaces (the other one being a negative control). Approximately 50 RU of material was immobilized. Both flow cells were then conditioned with several injections of 1.5 m NaCl. The conversion of RU to surface concentration of proteins was performed using a conversion factor of 1000 RU = 1 ng/mm2. Test samples were diluted in HBS maintained at 25 °C and injected over the heparin surface at a flow rate of 50 μl/min. This high flow rate was necessary to eliminate mass transport effect due to the relatively high association rate of the proteins being studied. In a typical analysis, six different SDF-1α concentrations (usually ranging between 0 and 200 nm) were injected onto the heparin surface for 3 min (to study the association phase and equilibrium). Thereafter, the formed complexes were washed at 50 μl/min with HBS to study the dissociation phase. The sensorchip surface was regenerated with a 2-min pulse of 1.5 m NaCl in HBS. In some experiments, soluble heparin was included in the buffer during the dissociation phase to minimize possible rebinding effects. Kinetic constants were derived from the sensorgrams by fitting the data to different interaction models, using BIAevaluation software, essentially as described (26Sadir R. Forest E. Lortat-Jacob H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10919-10925Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Affinities (dissociation equilibrium constants: Kd) were calculated from the ratio of dissociation and association rate constants (Kd =koff/kon). CEM cells (5 × 106 cells/ml) were incubated in PBS with 0.25 nm iodinated SDF-1α (New England Nuclear, specific activity, 2200 Ci/mmol) and various concentrations of unlabeled SDF-1α or SDF-1 3/6 for 1 h at 4 °C in a final volume of 300 μl. Incubations were terminated by centrifugation at 4 °C. The cell pellets were washed twice in ice-cold PBS. Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 1 μm unlabeled SDF-1α. Cell pellet-associated radioactivity was counted using a LKB-Wallac microcomputer controlled 1272 CliniGamma counter. The binding data were analyzed using a GraphPrad Prism 2.0 software. CEMx174 cells were resuspended in chemotaxis medium (RPMI 1640 containing 1% pasteurized human plasma protein (Swiss Red Cross Laboratory) and buffered with 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.3). Cell migration was performed in 48-well chemotaxis chambers (Neuro Probe Inc., Cabin John, MD) as described previously (27Loetscher P. Seitz M. Baggiolini M. Moser B. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 569-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). Chemokines diluted in chemotaxis medium were added to the lower and 105 CEMx174 cells in the same medium to the upper wells. Polycarbonate membranes with 5-μm pores (PC 5 μm PVPF, Costar, Cambridge, MA) were used to measure cell migration for 2 h at 37 °C. Membranes were removed, and the upper side was washed with PBS, fixed, and stained. Cell migration was assessed at 1000× magnification in five randomly selected fields. For calcium measurements, CEMx174 cells were washed twice with PBS and resuspended (2 × 106/ml) in 20 mm Hepes, 136 mm NaCl, 4.6 mm KCl, 1 mmCaCl2, pH 7.4. Aliquots of 1 ml were loaded with 0.8 μm Fura2/AM (Fluka AG, Buchs, Switzerland) for 20 min at 37 °C. The cells were sedimented and resuspended in fresh medium (1.25 × 106/ml). Calcium mobilization was determined as described previously (8Oberlin E. Amara A. Bachelerie F. Bessia C. Virelizier J.L. Arenzana-Seisdedos F. Schwartz O. Heard J.M. Clark-Lewis I. Legler D.F. Loetscher M. Baggiolini M. Moser B. Nature. 1996; 382: 833-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (1478) Google Scholar). Single-cell Ca2+ measurements were performed in HeLa cells loaded with Fura-2 (3 μm) as described previously (11Amara A. Legall S. Schwartz O. Salamero J. Montes M. Loetscher P. Baggiolini M. Virelizier J.L. Arenzana-Seisdedos F. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 139-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar). NMR experiments were acquired at 35 °C on a Varian Unity 500 spectrometer operating at 499.84 MHz for1H and equipped with a triple resonance z gradient 5-mm probe. Data were processed on a Sun workstation using the VNMR 5.3 program. All two-dimensional proton NMR experiments were acquired in the phase-sensitive mode using the hypercomplex scheme (28States D.J. Haberkorn R.A. Ruben D.J. J. Magn. Reson. 1982; 48: 286-292Google Scholar). A two-dimensional nuclear Overhauser experiment with pure absorption phase was performed in four quadrants. The SDF-1 3/6 sample was prepared by dissolving 6 mg of freeze-dried powder in 350 μl of 20 mm acetate buffer in 90% H2O/10% D2O, pH 5. The final concentration was 2.1 mm. The TOCSY and NOESY experiments were collected with mixing times of 80 and 200 ms, respectively, and with 512 t1increments of 32 scans each and 2048 points in the t2 dimension. In both dimensions, the data were apodized with a shifted sine-bell function before Fourier transformation and zero-filled to a final matrix of 4096 × 2048 points. The capacity of SDF-1α to bind cell membrane molecules other than CXCR4 was investigated using a novel mAb. The K15C mAb was obtained by immunizing mice with a linear peptide derived from the amino terminus of SDF-1α. In enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay experiments, the antibody showed specific reactivity with immobilized SDF-1α (Fig.1 a) as competition occurred when the antibodies were preincubated with free SDF-1α but not with the non-related chemokines RANTES, MIP-1α, or MIP-1β. Apart from SDF-1α or SDF-1β (Fig. 1 b) which differ exclusively by four amino acids at the carboxyl terminus domain, the antibody failed to recognize any other known CC or CXC chemokine (data not shown). To characterize further the specificity of epitope recognition by K15C mAb, we performed Western blot experiments using SDF-1α derivatives with progressive deletion of amino acids at the amino terminus of SDF-1α. SDF-1α derivatives lacking the two first residues (Lys1 and Pro2) (29Crump M.P. Gong J.H. Loetscher P. Rajarathnam K. Amara A. Arenzana-Seisdedos F. Virelizier J.L. Baggiolini M. Sykes B.D. Clark-Lewis I. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6996-7007Crossref PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar) were not recognized by the antibody. This proves that Lys1 and Pro2 are essential residues in the epitope recognized by K15C mAb (Fig.1 b). Importantly, incubation of K15C mAb fully prevented the biological activity of SDF-1α as assessed by its capacity to block SDF-1α-mediated CXCR4 endocytosis in Jurkat cells (Fig.1 c) or chemotaxis of human T lymphocytes (data not shown). CXCR4-negative CHO-K1 cells (Fig.2 b) were incubated with 10–1000 nm SDF-1α and labeled with the K15C mAb. The cytofluorographic analysis showed that SDF-1α bound to the cell surface in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig.2 a). The recognition of the SDF-1α·K15C complex by the secondary antibody was specific since no fluorescence was observed when SDF-1α was omitted or replaced by MIP-1β (1000 nm) (Fig. 2 a). The capacity of SDF-1α to bind to cells in a CXCR4-independent manner is not restricted to a particular cell type. Indeed, SDF-1α also bound to CXCR4-negative, endothelial cells (ECV304 cell line, Fig.2 b) with a comparable efficiency as to CHO-K1. Similarly, cell membrane-bound SDF-1α was found when the chemokine was incubated with HeLa cells that constitutively express CXCR4 (Fig. 2 b). SDF-1α binding detected by FACS analysis on HeLa cells was not due to interaction of the chemokine with CXCR4 because the K15C mAb exclusively recognizes the critical amino-terminal residues that are engaged in binding to CXCR4 and are required for SDF-1α-induced signal transduction (29Crump M.P. Gong J.H. Loetscher P. Rajarathnam K. Amara A. Arenzana-Seisdedos F. Virelizier J.L. Baggiolini M. Sykes B.D. Clark-Lewis I. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6996-7007Crossref PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar). Accordingly, we failed to detect SDF-1α bound to CXCR4-positive, CEM T lymphoblastoid cells (Fig.2 b). CEM cells express high levels of functional CXCR4 receptors, and saturable binding of SDF-1α in these cells has been shown (29Crump M.P. Gong J.H. Loetscher P. Rajarathnam K. Amara A. Arenzana-Seisdedos F. Virelizier J.L. Baggiolini M. Sykes B.D. Clark-Lewis I. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6996-7007Crossref PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar). This suggests that in CEM cells, CXCR4 accounts for most of the cellular binding of SDF-1α. Collectively, our results indicate that other structures apart from CXCR4 have the capacity to attach SDF-1α to the cell surface. These interactions apparently do not involve the amino terminus of SDF-1α that is recognized by the K15C mAb and is masked after interaction with CXCR4. To ascertain wheth"
https://openalex.org/W2027789202,"Heparan sulfate and heparan sulfate proteoglycans are present in the extracellular matrix as well as on the external cell surface. They bind various molecules such as growth factors and cytokines and modulate the biological functions of binding proteins. Heparan sulfate proteoglycans are also important structural components of the basement membrane. Heparanase is an endo-β-d-glucuronidase capable of cleaving heparan sulfate and has been implicated in inflammation and tumor angiogenesis and metastasis. In this study, we report the purification of a human heparanase from an SV40-transformed embryonic fibroblast cell line WI38/VA13 by four sequential column chromatographies. The activity was measured by high speed gel permeation chromatography of the degradation products of fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled heparan sulfate. The enzyme was purified to homogeneity, yielding a peptide with an apparent molecular mass of 50 kDa when analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Using the amino acid sequences of the N-terminal and internal heparanase peptides, a cDNA coding for human heparanase was cloned. NIH3T3 and COS-7 cells stably transfected with pBK-CMV expression vectors containing the heparanase cDNA showed high heparanase activities. The homology search revealed that no homologous protein had been reported."

PNKP is the first gene for a DNA-specific kinase from any organism.PNKP expression partially rescued the sensitivity to oxidative damaging agents of the Escherichia coli DNA repair-deficient xth nfo double mutant. PNKP gene function restored termini suitable for DNA polymerase, consistent with in vivo removal of 3′-phosphate groups, facilitating DNA repair. polynucleotide kinase fluorescence in situ hybridization single strand breaks tert-butylhydroperoxide high pressure liquid chromatography expressed sequence tag polymerase chain reaction kilobase(s) glutathione S-transferase apurinic/apyrimidinic methyl methane sulfonate Polynucleotide kinases catalyze phosphorylation of 5′-OH termini of nucleic acids.

We and others have purified such a PNK to near-homogeneity from bovine tissue, which lacks significant 5′-phosphorylation activity when assayed with RNA substrates (5Karimi-Busheri F Weinfeld M. J.

This activity, denoted SNQI-PNK, corresponded to a polypeptide of approximately 60 kDa in our experiments (6Jilani A. Slack C. Matheos D. Zannis-Hadjopoulos M. Lasko D.D. J. Cell. Biochem. 1999; 73: 188-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Highly purified SNQI-PNK fractions contain a 3′-phosphatase activity (6Jilani A. Slack C. Matheos D. Zannis-Hadjopoulos M. Lasko D.D. J. Cell. Biochem. 1999; 73: 188-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), originally discovered in the PNK from bacteriophage T4 (10Cameron V. Uhlenbeck O.C.

Furthermore, there are reports of mammalian PNK activities with a greater substrate specificity for RNA than DNA (8Prinos P. Slack C. Lasko D.D. J. Cell.

Jilani, unpublished observations. and of conservation of yeastlike tRNA ligation (with its requirement for a PNK activity) as a minor pathway in HeLa cells (15Zillmann M. Gorovsky M.A. Phizicky E.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 5410-5416Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar).Because of its widespread presence in mammalian cells, the acidic pH optimum PNK is likely to be a key enzyme in DNA metabolism, and its biochemical functions immediately suggest a role in the critical process of DNA repair. One of its enzymatic activities, DNA 3′-phosphatase, implies an ability to repair strand breaks terminated by 3′-phosphate, a type of DNA damage seen in cells treated with ionizing radiation or hydrogen peroxide (16Friedberg E.C. Walker G.C. Siede W. DNA Repair and Mutagenesis. ASM Press, Washington, DC1995Google Scholar). Removal of this 3′-end blocking lesion allows synthesis by DNA polymerase and joining of nicks by DNA ligase. DNA purified from irradiated thymocytes and irradiated thymus, but not DNA irradiated in vitro, contains strand breaks with 5′-OH termini (17Coquerelle T. Bopp A. Kessler B. Hagen U. Int. J. Radiat. Biol. 1973; 24: 397-404Crossref Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 18Lennartz M. Coquerelle T. Bopp A. Hagen U. Int. J. Radiat. Biol. 1975; 27: 577-587Crossref Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The 5′-phosphorylation activity of the SNQI-PNK enzyme suggests a possible model in which 5′-OH termini are repaired prior to ligation. 5′-OH termini in DNA also occur in ischemia in rat brain (19MacManus J.P. Rasquinha I. Tuor U. Preston E. J. Cereb. Blood. Flow. Metab. 1997; 17: 376-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), after cleavage by nucleases with the appropriate specificity such as DNase II (20Barry M.A. Eastman A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 330: 440-450Crossref Scopus (430) Google Scholar), and as intermediates during topoisomerase cleavage (21Champoux J.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1981; 118: 441-446Crossref Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 22Yang S.W. Burgin Jr., A.B. Huizenga B.N. Robertson C.A. Yao K.C. Nash H.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11534-11539Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). The highest concentration of 5′-DNA termini occurs during DNA replication, and Pohjanpelto and Hölttä (23Pohjanpelto P. Hölttä E. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1933-2000Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) proposed that a small fraction of Okazaki fragments contain 5′-OH termini; this fraction decreases upon incubation of extracts with ATP at pH 6.0, which was inferred to reflect 5′-phosphorylation by a cellular PNK.Despite extensive biochemical studies, to date there are no molecular reagents such as antibodies or cDNAs available for mammalian PNKs, hampering further investigation. We present here the molecular cloning of the PNKP gene, the first gene for a mammalian PNK and the first gene for a DNA-specific kinase from any organism. Concomitantly, the PNKP gene also represents the second gene for a mammalian DNA 3′-phosphatase; the previously described human APE/HAP1 AP endonuclease has a weak 3′-phosphatase activity (24Chen D.S. Herman T. Demple B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 5907-5914Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 25Demple B. Harrison L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 915-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (1287) Google Scholar). Using Escherichia coli as a model biological system, we report the first evidence for participation in DNA repair in vivo by the PNKP gene product.DISCUSSIONThe identification of a cDNA encoding a human PNKP represents the first mammalian polynucleotide kinase and the second mammalian 3′-phosphatase to be cloned. Importantly, this gene is the first DNA-specific kinase from any organism to be characterized at the molecular level. This discovery has allowed significant progress toward an understanding of its role in DNA metabolism, particularly in DNA repair of damage by oxidative damaging agents.We conclude that we have obtained a gene encoding a polynucleotide kinase 3′-phosphatase due to the 5′-DNA kinase and 3′-phosphatase activities of the GST-PNKP construct expressed in E. coli. The observation of 3′-phosphatase activity of the PNKP gene expressed in E. coli BW528, which lacks significant endogenous 3′-phosphatase activity that might have copurified with GST-PNKP, is incontrovertible evidence that the two activities are encoded by the same gene. Sequence similarity to T4 PNK in certain key motifs also supports our conclusion that a PNK gene has been cloned. Furthermore, antibodies raised against the PNKP peptide sequence recognize in immunoblots a bovine polypeptide of the size of the active DNA kinase detected in renaturation gel activity assays (6Jilani A. Slack C. Matheos D. Zannis-Hadjopoulos M. Lasko D.D. J. Cell. Biochem. 1999; 73: 188-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar).The PNKP gene product contains a motif found in adenine nucleotide-binding proteins (40Walker J.E. Saraste M. Runswick M.J. Gay N.J. EMBO J. 1982; 1: 945-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (4223) Google Scholar), GFPGAGKS, at residues 372–379. There is a corresponding conserved motif, GCPGSGKS, at positions 9–16 in the T4 polynucleotide kinase peptide sequence (41Midgley C.A. Murray N.E. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 2695-2703Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The importance of this conserved region for the polynucleotide kinase activity of the T4 enzyme correlates with mapping of the kinase domain to the N terminus (49Soltis D.A. Uhlenbeck O.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 11340-11345Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We identified in the T4 PNK peptide sequence (6Jilani A. Slack C. Matheos D. Zannis-Hadjopoulos M. Lasko D.D. J. Cell. Biochem. 1999; 73: 188-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) a series of three motifs that have been found to be important in numerous studies of proteins in the l-2-haloacid dehalogenase superfamily (42Aravind L. Galperin M.V. Koonin E.V. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 127-129Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 43Koonin E.V. Tatusov R.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 244: 125-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). In the PNKP gene product, a particularly important residue in catalysis is predicted to be aspartate 171, which is the conserved residue found to be critical for function of l-2-haloacid dehalogenase (50Hisano T. Hata Y. Fujii T. Liu J.-Q. Kurihara T. Esaki N. Soda K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20322-20330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) and observed to be phosphorylated when human phosphomannomutase, also a member of the superfamily, is incubated with substrate (51Collet J.-F. Stroobant V. Pirard M. Delpierre G. Van Schaftingen E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14107-14112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Interestingly, in the T4 sequence these motifs map to the C-terminal half of the protein (6Jilani A. Slack C. Matheos D. Zannis-Hadjopoulos M. Lasko D.D. J. Cell. Biochem. 1999; 73: 188-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), but in the mammalian PNKP protein sequence the motifs are centrally located between residues 171 and 290. The C. elegans and S. pombe genes that scored high in BLAST searches contained the putative 3′-phosphatase and nucleotide binding domains in the same order as in the PNKP protein. Thus, the organization of the putative active domains of the T4 PNK and PNKP proteins seems to differ considerably, with the relative locations of the putative PNK and 3′-phosphatase motifs switched. The observation that a GST fusion construct containing amino acids 69–521 of the conceptual translation product was active in E. coli was not entirely unexpected, since this construct contained 87% of the coding sequence, including the putative phosphatase motifs at residues 171–289 and the putative nucleotide binding site at residues 372–379 that would be anticipated to be critical for the 3′-phosphatase and 5′-kinase activities, respectively.The PNKP gene maps to chromosome 19q13.3–13.4, a region of the genome rich in well-characterized genes, including POLD1 at 19q13.3–13.4 (52Kemper R.R. Ahn E.R. Zhang M.P. Lee M.Y.W.T. Rabin M. Genomics. 1992; 14: 205-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), and LIG1 at 19q13.2-q13.3 (53Barnes D.E. Kodama K. Tynan K. Trask B.J.

Carrano A. Tynan K. Genomics. 1993; 15: 133-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), ERCC2/XPD at 19q13.2-q13.3 (55Mohrenweiser H.W. Carrano A.V. Fertitta A. Perry B. Thompson L.H. Tucker J.D.

Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man, OMIM. Center for Medical Genetics, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD1998Google Scholar) revealed no obvious candidate human disease mapping to this area of the genome; however, since many human genetic diseases have not been mapped, a contribution of PNKP to human disease burden cannot be ruled out. This part of chromosome 19 is involved in certain translocations found in malignancies (57McKusick V. Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man, OMIM. Center for Medical Genetics, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD1998Google Scholar). In addition, loss of heterozygosity of this portion of chromosome 19 has been reported in some neoplasms (58Bello M.J. Leone P.E. Vaquero J. de Campos J.M. Kusak M.E. Sarasa J.L. Pestana A. Rey J.A.

Cancer. 1994; 57: 676-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar).Preliminary gene expression studies revealed two major signals upon Northern analysis of samples of human poly(A)+ RNA, corresponding to sizes of 2 and 7.5 kb. The cDNA sequences obtained correspond well to the size of the smaller of the two messages. In the tissues that we examined, testis and spleen displayed greater amounts of the 2-kb message when the results were normalized to expression of the GAPDH gene. The larger message is of unknown biological significance; it was detectable with a probe containing the 3′ end of the cDNA and a probe from the interior of the cDNA. The genomic DNA library screening results and FISH mapping results are strongly indicative of one gene. The larger message may be an alternatively spliced transcript, although dbEST clones analyzed so far do not support this notion, or perhaps may represent retained intron sequences.A potential physiological role in DNA repair has been suggested repeatedly from biochemical studies of mammalian DNA kinase. Findings from in vitro reconstitution experiments with synthetic substrates containing 3′-phosphate and/or 5′-OH termini support the notion that polynucleotide kinase 3′-phosphatases can function in DNA repair (4Habraken Y. Verly W.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 171: 59-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 63Karimi-Busheri F. Lee J. Tomkinson A.E. Weinfeld M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 4395-4400Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Another correlation with DNA repair is that the first human DNA 3′-phosphatase to be cloned is the APE/HAP1 gene, which has a firmly established DNA repair function supported by many biochemical and genetic studies. The APE/HAP1 gene is a member of the exonuclease III family, which together with the endonuclease IV family includes enzymes detected in E. coli and eukaryotes that are able to repair 3′-phosphate damage at DNA strand breaks (25Demple B. Harrison L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 915-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (1287) Google Scholar, 64Ramotar D. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1997; 75: 327-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). These proteins have multiple functions, including Type II AP endonuclease activity, 3′-phosphodiesterase activity, and sometimes an exonuclease activity. Biochemical studies of APE/HAP1 function (25Demple B. Harrison L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 915-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (1287) Google Scholar) indicate that it is unlikely to be responsible for repair of all 3′-blocking residues arising from radiation or oxidative damage to DNA. Moreover, fractionation of mammalian cells suggests the presence of multiple 3′-phosphodiesterase activities (24Chen D.S. Herman T. Demple B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 5907-5914Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 65Winters T.A. Weinfeld M. Jorgensen T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 2573-2580Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar).To investigate the role of PNKP in DNA repair in vivo, we performed heterologous complementation experiments. Rescue of a mutant phenotype in another species can often provide compelling evidence for a physiological role. We took advantage of the availability of E. coli with vastly reduced 3′-phosphodiesterase activity, xth nfo mutants deficient in AP endonuclease activity and 3′-phosphodiesterase activity (37Cunningham R.P. Saporito S.O. Spitzer S.G. Weiss B. J. Bacteriol. 1986; 168: 1120-1127Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We performed experiments testing sensitivity to the DNA damaging agents hydrogen peroxide and tBH. As expected, the BW528 (xth nfo) cells were highly sensitive, and overexpression of the bacterial nfo gene provided resistance. Our discovery that overexpression of pGST-PNKP, but not an empty vector or pGST-hLIG1, partially overcame the sensitivity to these oxidative DNA damaging agents but not to formaldehyde used in control experiments, supports a role for PNKP in DNA repair in living cells. Importantly, isolated DNA from H2O2-treated cells expressing pGST-PNKP, but not cells expressing the empty vector, pGEX-4-T-3, was a better substrate for DNA polymerase. This reflects in vivo DNA repair and shows that the partial mutant rescue was correlated with events at the DNA level rather than some other effect on cellular response to H2O2.The ability of PNKP to confer partial resistance to the alkylating agent MMS to strain BW528 can be explained if endogenous AP lyases, i.e. formamidopyrimidine-DNA glycosylase, endonuclease III, or endonuclease VIII, cleave the MMS-induced AP sites to produce blocked 3′-termini, such as 3′-phosphate. Alternatively, the PNKP enzyme might directly cleave the AP sites. This latter possibility is supported by the finding that GST-PNKP purified from AP endonuclease-deficient strain BW528 weakly cleaves a substrate with a centrally located AP site (66Masson J.Y. Ramotar D. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 24: 711-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Experiments are in progress to determine if the enzyme acts as an AP lyase or as a hydrolytic AP endonuclease that directly produces 3′-hydroxyl termini, which are compatible with DNA repair synthesis. The inability of PNKP to fully restore drug resistance to strain BW528 is not entirely surprising, since the enzyme is not in its natural environment. In fact, expression of the yeast homologue of endonuclease IV, Apn1, in strain BW528 also only partially substitutes for endonuclease IV (39Ramotar D. Popoff S.C. Demple B. Mol. Microbiol. 1991; 5: 149-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). We cannot completely exclude the possibilities that the N-terminal 13% of the polypeptide may be required for full complementation or that the GST domain may interfere with the enzyme's ability to process DNA lesions. Furthermore, in mammalian cells, PNKP may require accessory factors, which are lacking in E. coli, to efficiently repair damaged DNA.This work provides support for a crucial function of the 3′-phosphatase activity of the PNKP gene product in repair of oxidative DNA damage in mammalian cells. Importantly, this type of damage arises endogenously during normal cellular metabolism, and its repair is essential for cellular survival. The role of the 5′-DNA kinase activity of the gene product may also reside in DNA repair, restoring 5′-OH termini arising during the life of the cell to 5′-P termini suitable for ligation. The PNKP gene product may also participate in DNA replication. The molecular reagents reported here, together with the appropriate genetic model systems that we have now identified, will allow further detailed analysis of the biological implications of juxtaposition of 5′-DNA kinase and 3′-phosphatase activities in the same enzyme.Note Added in ProofKarimi-Busheri et al.

Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 5410-5416Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Because of its widespread presence in mammalian cells, the acidic pH optimum PNK is likely to be a key enzyme in DNA metabolism, and its biochemical functions immediately suggest a role in the critical process of DNA repair. One of its enzymatic activities, DNA 3′-phosphatase, implies an ability to repair strand breaks terminated by 3′-phosphate, a type of DNA damage seen in cells treated with ionizing radiation or hydrogen peroxide (16Friedberg E.C. Walker G.C. Siede W. DNA Repair and Mutagenesis. ASM Press, Washington, DC1995Google Scholar). Removal of this 3′-end blocking lesion allows synthesis by DNA polymerase and joining of nicks by DNA ligase. DNA purified from irradiated thymocytes and irradiated thymus, but not DNA irradiated in vitro, contains strand breaks with 5′-OH termini (17Coquerelle T. Bopp A. Kessler B. Hagen U. Int. J. Radiat.

The 5′-phosphorylation activity of the SNQI-PNK enzyme suggests a possible model in which 5′-OH termini are repaired prior to ligation. 5′-OH termini in DNA also occur in ischemia in rat brain (19MacManus J.P.

https://openalex.org/W2127698844,"Human polydeoxyribonucleotide kinase is an enzyme that has the capacity to phosphorylate DNA at 5′-hydroxyl termini and dephosphorylate 3′-phosphate termini and, therefore, can be considered a putative DNA repair enzyme. The enzyme was purified from HeLa cells. Amino acid sequence was obtained for several tryptic fragments by mass spectrometry. The sequences were matched through the dbEST data base with an incomplete human cDNA clone, which was used as a probe to retrieve the 5′-end of the cDNA sequence from a separate cDNA library. The complete cDNA, which codes for a 521-amino acid protein (57.1 kDa), was expressed in Escherichia coli, and the recombinant protein was shown to possess the kinase and phosphatase activities. Comparison with other sequenced proteins identified a P-loop motif, indicative of an ATP-binding domain, and a second motif associated with several different phosphatases.

Many arise during regular cellular activity such as DNA replication, recombination, or differentiation. Others occur as a consequence of exposure to endogenous or exogenous DNA damaging agents. Repair of these strand interruptions is usually mediated by DNA ligases and polymerases. Both of these classes of enzymes require 3′-hydroxyl DNA termini, and the DNA ligases also require 5′-phosphate termini. However, the termini generated by nucleases, such as DNase II, and many produced by ionizing radiation bear 3′-phosphate and 5′-hydroxyl groups (1Bernardi G. Adv. Enzymol. 1968; 31: 1-49PubMed Google Scholar, 2Coquerelle T. Bopp A. Kessler B. Hagen U. Int. J. Radiat. Biol. 1973; 24: 397-404Crossref Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 3Lennartz M. Coquerelle T.

One enzyme that possesses the capacity to both phosphorylate 5′-hydroxyl termini and dephosphorylate 3′-phosphate termini is polynucleotide kinase (PNK).1The PNK from T4 phage has found widespread application in molecular biology, especially for radiolabeling DNA and oligonucleotides (5Midgley C.A. Murray N.E. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 2695-2703Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). It can act on DNA and RNA and even phosphorylate nucleoside 3′-monophosphates. However, the main cellular function of the T4 enzyme is not to repair DNA, but rather to counter the action of a phage endoribonuclease that cleaves tRNA (6Amitsur M. Levitz R. Kaufmann G. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 2499-2503Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Eukaryotic PNKs fall into two categories depending on whether their preferred substrate is DNA or RNA (7Kleppe K. Lillehaug J.R. Adv. Enzymol. 1979; 48: 245-275PubMed Google Scholar). While both can phosphorylate 5′-termini, only the former have an associated 3′-phosphatase activity (8Pheiffer B.H.

The only significant discrepancy has been the molecular mass assigned to the polypeptides. Earlier reports regarding the PNK purified from rat organs indicated that the protein may be an 80-kDa homodimer composed of 40-kDa polypeptides (9Habraken Y. Verly W.G. FEBS Lett. 1983; 160: 46-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 10Habraken Y. Verly W.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 171: 59-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 18Bosdal T. Lillehaug J.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 840: 280-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), but PNK activity in tissue extracts detected on activity gels migrated as a 60-kDa polypeptide (20Ohmura Y. Uchida T. Teraoka H. Tsukada K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 162: 15-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Estimates for the size of calf thymus PNK have ranged from 56 to 70 kDa (16Austin G.E. Sirakoff D. Roop B. Moyer G.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1978; 522: 412-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 17Tamura S. Teraoka H. Tsukada K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1981; 115: 449-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). We and others have recently purified the DNA kinases from calf thymus and rat liver to near homogeneity, making use of a broad spectrum of proteolysis inhibitors (11Karimi-Busheri F. Weinfeld M. J. Cell. Biochem. 1997; 64: 258-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 12Jilani A. Slack C. Matheos D. Zannis-Hadjopoulos M. Lasko D.D. J. Cell. Biochem. 1999; 73: 188-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The major protein band migrated as a 60-kDa peptide on polyacrylamide gels, but a minor band was observed at 40 kDa in the rat liver preparation. At present, the cellular function of mammalian DNA kinases has not been elucidated. Clearly, one possibility is participation in the repair of strand breaks induced by DNA damaging agents, such as ionizing radiation or topoisomerase inhibitors (21Karimi-Busheri F. Lee J. Tomkinson A.E. Weinfeld M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 4395-4400Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 22Yang S.-W. Burgin Jr A.B. Huizenga B.N. Robertson C.A. Yao K.C. Nash H.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11534-11539Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). We have shown that, unlike T4 phage PNK, calf thymus PNK is able to efficiently phosphorylate the 5′-OH terminus at a nick and a one-nucleotide gap in a double-stranded DNA substrate (11Karimi-Busheri F. Weinfeld M. J. Cell. Biochem. 1997; 64: 258-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Furthermore, an in vitro system consisting of purified mammalian PNK, DNA polymerase β, and DNA ligase I was able to effect the complete repair of nicks and short gaps bounded by 3′-phosphate and 5′-OH termini (21Karimi-Busheri F. Lee J. Tomkinson A.E. Weinfeld M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 4395-4400Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Alternatively, PNK could participate in a more regular function. For example, it has been observed that a proportion of Okazaki fragments have 5′-OH termini (23Pohjanpelto P. Hölttä E. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1193-1200Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), which would have to be phosphorylated prior to ligation. As part of our ongoing study to address the question of the role of eukaryotic PNKs, this paper describes the molecular cloning, sequencing, cellular localization, and chromosomal mapping of human PNK. The DNA substrate containing 5′-OH termini was prepared by digestion of calf thymus DNA with micrococcal nuclease as described by Richardson (24Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1965; 54: 158-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar). Each 5′-phosphorylation reaction mixture (20 μl ), containing 10 μg of DNA substrate, 3 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), 500 nm unlabeled ATP, 80 mm succinic acid, pH 5.5, 10 mmMgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mmEGTA, 2 μg of bovine serum albumin, and protein fraction (typically 4 μl), was incubated for 20 min at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped and the DNA precipitated by addition of 200 μl of 20% trichloroacetic acid and 100 μl of 250 μm sodium pyrophosphate containing 50 μg of bovine serum albumin. Following centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min, the pellets were resuspended in 80 μl of 0.1 m NaOH and reprecipitated by addition of 400 μl of 10% trichloroacetic acid. This wash step was repeated once more before the radioactivity of the pellet was determined. As a control for kinase specificity (i.e. DNA versus protein), parallel reactions were carried out in the absence of the DNA substrate. The 3′-dephosphorylation of a 21-mer oligonucleotide (p21p) catalyzed by recombinant human PNK in Escherichia coli cell extracts was assayed by gel electrophoresis as described previously (21Karimi-Busheri F. Lee J. Tomkinson A.E. Weinfeld M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 4395-4400Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). A pellet of frozen HeLa S3 cells (3 × 1010, approximately 50 ml packed cell volumes) was thawed in 200 ml of hypotonic buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mm MgCl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.5 mm EDTA) containing a mixture of protease inhibitors (25 μg/ml N ε-p-tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketone, 5 μg/ml chymotrypsin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.5 μg/ml pepstatin, and 1 mmα-toluenesulfonyl fluoride) and held for 20 min at 0 °C before disruption in a Dounce glass homogenizer (15 strokes). Nuclei were collected by low speed centrifugation, and a protein extract was prepared in the presence of 0.3 m KCl as described previously (25Masutani C. Sugasawa K. Yanagisawa J. Sonoyama T. Ui M. Enomoto T. Takio K. Tanaka K. van der Spek P.J. Bootsma D. Hoeijmakers J.H.J. Hanaoka F. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1831-1843Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). Sequential chromatography of the extract on a phosphocellulose P11 column (Whatman, Clifton, NJ) and an Ultrogel AcA34 gel filtration column (Sepracor/IBF, Marlborough, MA), and ammonium sulfate precipitation steps were carried out as described by Robins and Lindahl (26Robins P. Lindahl T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24257-24261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), except that the elution buffer for the first column contained 0.6 m KCl and the elution buffer for the second column contained 0.5 m NaCl. The active fractions in the second peak from the gel filtration column were pooled (63 mg of protein in a total volume of 54 ml), dialyzed against buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm potassium phosphate, and 10% glycerol). The specific activity at this stage of purification was approximately 0.06 units/mg of protein, where one unit of enzyme is the amount required to incorporate 1 nmol of phosphate from ATP into micrococcal nuclease-treated DNA in 30 min at 37 °C (27Richardson C.C. Cantoni G.L. Davies D.R. Procedures in Nucleic Acid Research. 2. Harper and Row, New York1971: 815-828Google Scholar). The pooled material was loaded onto a column (2.5 × 5.0 cm) of Bio-Gel HT hydroxyapatite (Bio-Rad) pre-equilibrated with buffer A. The column was washed with five volumes of buffer A before eluting bound protein with a 200-ml linear gradient of 50–500 mm potassium phosphate in buffer A collecting in 5-ml fractions. The active fractions, 28–33, were pooled and dialyzed against buffer B (10 mm potassium phosphate, pH 6.8, 4 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 10% glycerol) containing 50 mm KCl. The material was loaded onto a 1-ml HiTrap SP column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), washed with 10 column volumes of buffer B and eluted with a 30-ml linear gradient of 50–600 mm KCl in 30 1-ml fractions. A peak of kinase activity eluted at fractions 10–12. The contents of fraction 11 were dialyzed against buffer C (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm potassium phosphate, and 10% glycerol) containing 50 mm NaCl, and loaded onto a Mono S PC 1.6/5 column attached to a SMART micropurification chromatography system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Protein was eluted with a 2-ml linear salt gradient of 50–450 mm NaCl at a flow rate of 100 μl/min in 20 100-μl fractions. After assaying the fractions for DNA kinase activity, a small quantity of each fraction was examined by SDS-PAGE to determine which polypeptide correlated with activity. The remaining contents of the fraction with the peak of kinase activity (fraction 12) was further fractionated by gel electrophoresis and electroblotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The electroblotted HeLa protein was stained with sulforhodamine B (0.05% w/v in 30% v/v aqueous methanol, 0.1% v/v acetic acid) using a rapid-staining protocol (28Coull J.M. Pappin D.J.C. J. Protein Chem. 1990; 9: 259-260Google Scholar). The dried, stained protein was then digested in situ on the polyvinylidene difluoride membrane with trypsin (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, modified) for 18 h at 30 °C and the peptides extracted with 1:1 v/v formic acid/ethanol (29Sutton C.W.

Aliquots were sampled and directly analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI) time-of-flight mass spectrometry using a LaserMat 2000 mass spectrometer (Thermo Bioanalysis, UK) (30Mock K.K. Sutton C.W. Cottrell J.S. Rapid Commun. Mass Spectrom. 1992; 6: 233-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Additional aliquots were quantitatively esterified using 1% v/v thionyl chloride in methanol and also analyzed by MALDI to provide acidic residue composition (31Pappin D.J.C. Rahman D. Hansen H.F. Bartlet-Jones M. Jeffery W.A. Bleasby A.J. Burlingame A.L. Carr S.A. Mass Spectrometry in the Biological Sciences. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ1996: 135-150Crossref Google Scholar). Native and esterified peptide masses were then screened against the MOWSE peptide mass fingerprint data base (32Pappin D.J.C. Hojrup P. Bleasby A.J. Curr. Biol. 1993; 3: 327-332Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1416) Google Scholar). The remaining digested peptides (>90% of total digest) were then reacted with N-succinimidyl-2-morpholine acetate (SMA) in order to enhance b-ion abundance and facilitate sequence analysis by tandem mass spectrometry (33Sherman, N. E., Yates, N. A., Shabanowitz, J., Hunt, D. F., Jeffery, W. A., Bartlet-Jones, M., and Pappin, D. J. C. (1995) Proceedings of the 43rd ASMS Conference on Mass Spectrometry and Allied Topics, May 21–26, 1995, Atlanta, GAGoogle Scholar). Dried peptide fractions were treated with 7 μl of freshly prepared, ice-cold 1% w/v N-succinimidyl-2-morpholine acetate in 1.0 mHEPES (pH 7.8 with NaOH) containing 2% v/v acetonitrile. Following reaction for 20 min on ice, the reaction was terminated by the addition of 1 μl of heptafluorobutyric acid and diluted with an equal volume of water. The solution was then injected in three 5-μl aliquots onto a capillary reverse-phase column (300 μm x 15 cm) packed with POROS R2/H material (Perseptive Biosystems, MA) equilibrated with 2% v/v methanol, 0.05% v/v trifluoroacetic acid running at 3 μl/min. The adsorbed peptides were washed isocratically with 15% v/v methanol, 0.05% v/v trifluoroacetic acid for 30 min at 3 μl/min to elute the excess reagent and HEPES buffer. Derivatized peptides were eluted with a single step gradient to 75% v/v methanol, 0.1% v/v formic acid and collected in two 3-μl fractions. The derivatized peptides were then sequenced by low energy collision-activated dissociation using a Finnigan MAT TSQ7000 tandem triple quadrupole mass spectrometer and a Finnigan MAT LCQ ion-trap mass spectrometer, both instruments fitted with nanoelectrospray sources (34Hunt D.F. Yates J.R. Shabanowitz J. Winston S. Hauer C.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 84: 6233-6237Crossref Scopus (1073) Google Scholar, 35Wilm M. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (1696) Google Scholar). Collision-activated dissociation was typically performed with collisional offset voltages between −18 and −30 V. Two tryptic peptides from previously purified calf thymus PNK (11Karimi-Busheri F. Weinfeld M. J. Cell. Biochem. 1997; 64: 258-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) were sequenced by the Harvard Microchemistry Facility (Cambridge, MA) using either an ABI 477A protein sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) or an HP G1000A (Hewlett Packard, Palo Alto, CA). Confirmation of sequence was obtained by MALDI time-of-flight mass spectrometry on a LaserMat 2000 mass spectrometer. DNA sequences derived from the peptide sequences were used to screen the dbEST data base (NIH). A cDNA clone from infant brain (clone number 32798 inserted in lafmid BA) was identified and obtained from the I.M.A.G.E. Consortium. The cDNA insert (1548 bp) was fully sequenced, using an automated ABI Prism 377 DNA analysis system (Applied Biosystems), and confirmed the presence of the poly(A) tail, and a large open reading frame, but no clearly identifiable start codon. A 609-bp probe, prepared by digestion of clone 32798 with Hin dIII and Pst I (New England Biolabs, Beverley, MA), was subsequently used to screen a λgt11 HeLa cell 5′-STRETCH PLUS cDNA library (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) by a standard protocol (36Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Ten positive clones were isolated, none of which contained a poly(A) tail. The largest insert (1.5 kilobase pairs) was amplified by PCR using the λ forward and reverse primers with Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), and then sequenced. Putative full-length cDNA was reconstituted as follows: (i) the PCR-amplified product was digested with Sac I and shrimp alkaline phosphatase (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and the larger fragment (1.1 kilobase pairs) isolated by agarose gel electrophoresis, (ii) the DNA of clone 32798 was digested with Sac I, (iii) the DNA molecules were ligated using phage T4 DNA ligase (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and (iv) the ligation product was digested with Eco RI. The cDNA was amplified by PCR using Pfu DNA polymerase and primers with tails that provided cleavage sites for Nde I (5′-TTTGAATTCCCATATGGGCGAGGTGGAGCCCCCGGGC-3′) and Bam HI (5′-CGCGGATCCTCAGCCCTCGGAGAACTGGCAG-3′) and then subcloned into the expression plasmid pET-16b (Novagen Inc., Madison, WI). The new plasmid (pPNK-His), which codes for a His-tagged derivative of PNK, was transfected into host E. coli bacterial strain BLR(DE3) (Novagen). The bacteria were grown at 37 °C to an OD600 of 0.6 in 100 ml of LB medium containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin and 12.5 μg/ml tetracycline. Zinc chloride was then added to the medium to a final concentration of 0.015 mm, and PNK expression was induced at 30 °C for 3 h by addition of 0.4 mm (final concentration) isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (Sigma). After harvesting the cells by centrifugation at 5000 × g at 4 °C for 5 min, they were resuspended in 10 ml of extraction buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.015 mmZnCl2, 6 mm mercaptoethanol). Lysozyme was added to a final concentration of 100 μg/ml together with Triton X-100 (final concentration, 0.1%), and, after incubation at 30 °C for 15 min, the bacteria were disrupted by sonication. The soluble fraction was separated from the insoluble fraction by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The insoluble fraction was resuspended in 1 ml of extraction buffer. The 609-bp Hin dIII/Pst I fragment used to screen the HeLa cDNA library was also used to probe a human multiple tissue Northern blot (CLONTECH) containing 2 μg (per lane) of polyadenylated RNA isolated from eight different human tissues. Hybridization was performed at 68 °C for 1 h under conditions described by the manufacturer. As a control for the amounts of mRNA in each lane, the membrane was reprobed with a sequence of β-actin cDNA provided by CLONTECH. A synthetic peptide antigen was prepared commercially (SSPEQ, Quebec) from the first 17 amino acids of peptide sequence 1 (Table I) conjugated to a four-branch multiple antigenic peptide carrier. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies were raised by standard protocol (37Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual.

Open table in a new tab The human malignant lung cell line A549 (ATCC no. CCL-185) was grown as a monolayer on glass microscope slides to 80% confluence. Following rinsing in PBS, the cells were fixed in 95% ethanol at −20 °C for 15 min. The slides were allowed to dry, and were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with 1% skim milk powder in PBS to minimize nonspecific binding of the immunoreagents. Following extensive PBS rinsing, the slides were incubated overnight at 4 °C in the rabbit polyclonal antiserum (diluted 1/30 in PBS), in a humidified atmosphere. The cells were then rinsed extensively with PBS, and rhodamine-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (H+L, Cappel Laboratories, Durham, NC) was applied at a dilution of 1/30 in PBS for a 1-h incubation at 37 °C in a water-saturated atmosphere. The unbound fluorescent antibody was removed by extensive washing in PBS, and the slides were covered with coverslips for confocal microscopy using PBS/glycerol, 1:1 as a mounting medium. The instrumentation and the procedures for the confocal laser scanning microscopy have been described previously (38Miller G.G. Brown K. Moore R.B. Diwu Z.J. Liu J. Huang L. Lown J.W. Begg D.A. Chlumecky V. Tulip J. McPhee M.S. Photochem. Photobiol. 1995; 61: 632-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Fluorescence in situ hybridization was performed as described previously (39Rowley J.D. Diaz M.O. Espinosa R. Patel Y.D. van Melle E. Ziemin S. Taillon-Miller P. Lichter P. Evans G.A. Kersey J.D.

Human metaphase cells were prepared from phytohemagglutinin-stimulated peripheral blood lymphocytes. Biotin-labeled probes were prepared by nick translation using Bio-16-dUTP (Enzo Diagnostics, Farmingdale, NY). One PNK probe was clone 32798 (including the plasmid vector). A second probe, which provided a 440-bp sequence stretching from the 5′-untranslated region into the 5′-end of the translated sequence, was generated by PCR amplification of the HeLa cDNA clone using the λgt11 forward primer and a reverse primer, 5′-GTGGAGGCCATTGACCAAATA-3′. The two clones were labeled and co-hybridized to the chromosome preparations. Hybridization was detected with fluorescein-conjugated avidin (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA), and chromosomes were identified by staining with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole-dihydrochloride. Fractions of a crude extract of HeLa cells that was passed down an AcA 34 Ultragel size exclusion column in the presence of 0.5m NaCl were shown to contain DNA kinase activity (Fig.1). Two peaks of activity were apparent, the first migrating with the bulk of the higher molecular weight protein, which may suggest that PNK is bound in a complex to other proteins, and the second eluting with proteins in the range of 40–100 kDa. Initial steps in the purification were carried out by conventional chromatography using gel filtration, hydroxyapatite, and cation exchange media. For the final step, the protein was applied on a SMART system precision column and eluted in 20 100-μl fractions with a 2-ml salt gradient (50–450 mm NaCl). The kinase assay revealed a peak of activity centering on fraction 12 (Fig.2 A). Correlation of the intensities of the protein bands in fractions 10–14 (Fig.2 B) with kinase activity strongly suggested that the ∼60-kDa band (topmost of the three major bands in fraction 12, marked by an arrow) was responsible for the PNK activity. Accordingly, this band was chosen for amino acid sequencing.F"

In this study, we investigated the interaction between thrombin and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), the specific endothelial cell mitogen and key angiogenic factor. Exposure of human umbilical vein endothelial cells to thrombin sensitizes these cells to the mitogenic activity of VEGF. This thrombin-mediated effect is specific, dose-dependent and requires the activated thrombin receptor. Quantitative reverse transcription- polymerase chain reaction analysis reveals a time- and dose-dependent up-regulation of mRNA for VEGF receptors (KDR and flt-1). Optimal thrombin concentration for maximal expression of mRNA for KDR is 1.5 IU/ml (170% over controls) and appears 8–12 h after thrombin stimulation. Nuclear run-on experiments demonstrate that the up-regulation of KDR mRNA by thrombin occurred at the transcriptional level. In addition, functional protein of KDR receptor is increased to about 200% over control after 12 h of thrombin treatment. The up-regulation of KDR and flt-1 mRNA is also mimicked by the thrombin receptor activating peptide. These findings could explain at least in part the potent angiogenic action of thrombin.

Lectures in Clinical Medicine, Delivered in Hotel-Dieu, Paris. New Sydenham Society, London1872: 281-295Google Scholar), that there is frequent blood coagulation in cancer patients, has been verified by many investigators. Clinical, laboratory, histopathological, and pharmacological evidence support the notion that a systemic activation of blood coagulation is often present in cancer patients (2Rickles F.R. Edwards R.L. Blood. 1983; 64: 14-31Crossref Google Scholar). This may be explained by the fact that many tumor cells elicit procoagulant activity either directly or through interaction with platelets, leukocyte and endothelial cells (3Sloan B.F. Rozhin J. Jonhson K. Taylor H. Crissman J.D. Honn K.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 2483-2487Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Zacharsky et al. (4Zacharsky L.R. Memoli V.A. Morain W.D. Schlaeppi J.M. Rousseau S.M. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1995; 73: 793-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) have shown recently the presence of thrombin in a variety of tumor types. The presence of thrombin in these tumors explains the hypercoagulability in cancer but does not answer the question whether thrombin contributes directly to the tumor promotion and metastasis. It has been shown in a recent large clinical study that primary thromboembolism increases by 3-fold the risk of overt cancer diagnosis within the next 6–12 months after thrombosis (5Sörensen H.T. Mellem K.L. Steffensen F.H. Olsen J.H. Nielsen G.L. N. Engl. J. Med. 1998; 338: 1169-1173Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar). These clinical observations are in line with animal experiments, where thrombin treatment of B16 melanoma cells increases dramatically the number of lung metastasis in rats (6Nierodzik M.L. Kajumo F. Karpatikin S. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 3267-3272PubMed Google Scholar). More recently, it has been shown that the metastatic ability of human breast cancer cells is related to the number of thrombin receptors on these cells (7Even-Ram S. Usiely B. Cohen P. Grisaru-Granovsky S. Maoz M. Ginzburg Y. Reich R. Vlodavsky I. Bar-Shavit R. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 909-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). These tumor-promoting effects of thrombin may be related to our previous finding that thrombin is a potent stimulator of angiogenesis. This was shown in the chick chorioallantoic membrane system (8Tsopanoglou N.E. Pipili-Synetos E. Maragoudakis M.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: C1302-C1307Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and the mouse Matrigel system (9Haralabopoulos G.C. Grant D.S. Kleinman H.K. Maragoudakis M.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: C239-C242Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In view of the pivotal role of angiogenesis in tumor progression and metastasis (10Folkman J. Adv. Cancer Res. 1985; 43: 172-203Google Scholar), this new action of thrombin on angiogenesis may provide an explanation for the aforementioned observations in animal models of cancer and in the clinic. In addition to cancer in many other conditions, where angiogenesis is activated, there is bleeding, and therefore blood coagulation and thrombin generation (e.g. wound healing, diabetic retinopathy, within the atherosclerotic plaque, endometrium, etc.). Thrombin has many actions on various cell types (11Kanthou C. Kakkar V.V. Benzakour O. Maragoudakis M.E. Angiogenesis Models, Modulators, and Clinical Applications. 298. Plenum Press, New York1998: 263-282Crossref Google Scholar), which may support the angiogenic process in all these conditions. However, the specific molecular mechanism(s) by which thrombin activates the angiogenic cascade have not been elucidated. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)1 and its two tyrosine kinase receptors (the kinase insert domain-containing receptor, KDR; and Fms-like tyrosine kinase, flt-1), play important roles in mediating physiological and pathological angiogenesis (12Ferrara N. Davis-Smyth T. Endocr. Rev. 1997; 18: 4-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (3668) Google Scholar). Although VEGF is expressed in various cell types, KDR and flt-1 expression is primarily restricted to vascular endothelial cells (13Terman B.I. Dougher-Vermazen M. Carrion M.E. Dimitrov D.

The loss of even a single VEGF gene results in embryonic lethality, showing the central role of this factor in vascular system development (22Carmeliet P. Ferreira V. Breier G. Pollefeyt S.

Nature. 1996; 380: 439-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (3048) Google Scholar). In the majority of human tumors, the overexpression of VEGF has been correlated with high vascularity, lymph node and liver metastasis, and a poorer prognosis than VEGF-negative tumors (24Maeda K.

Antibodies to VEGF or expression of a dominant-negative VEGF receptor inhibit tumor growth in vivo without affecting tumor cell proliferation in vitro, showing that the inhibitory effect on tumor growth is mediated by blockage of the angiogenic activity of VEGF (25Kim K.J.

Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 3540-3545PubMed Google Scholar). These findings implicate VEGF as the most important angiogenesis factor so far identified. In this study, we explored the possibility that thrombin is involved in the well defined and specific VEGF-mediated angiogenesis. We demonstrate that thrombin greatly potentiates VEGF-induced endothelial cell mitogenesis and that this potentiation is accompanied by up-regulation of mRNA of KDR and flt-1. We also show for KDR that this up-regulation is taking place at the transcriptional level and is accompanied by an increase in immunoprecipitable functional KDR protein. The transduction mechanisms for these thrombin-receptor-mediated events seem to proceed via protein kinase C (PKC) and mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases. HUVECs were obtained by established methods (29Jaffe E.A. Nachman R.-L. Becker C.G. Minick C.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1973; 52: 2745-2756Crossref PubMed Scopus (6012) Google Scholar) from freshly delivered umbilical cords from caesarean births. Cells were cultured as described previously (9Haralabopoulos G.C. Grant D.S. Kleinman H.K. Maragoudakis M.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: C239-C242Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and were used for experiments from passages 4–6. HUVECs were seeded sparsely (10,000 cells/well) into 24-well plates and cultured for 2 days. Cells were then made quiescent by incubation in M199/4% FBS for 24 h. After two washes with serum-free M199, cells were preincubated with M199 supplemented with 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA, fraction V, Sigma) alone or with thrombin (kindly provided by Dr. J. Fenton II, New York State University, Albany, NY) or with TRAP (Bachem, Bubendorf, Switzerland). PPACK-thrombin (kindly provided by Dr. J. Fenton II) or hirudin (Sigma) was used in the experiments indicated alone and in combination with thrombin. The time of incubation ranged from 30 min to 12 h, as indicated in the figure legends. Subsequently, the cells were washed twice with serum-free M199 and incubated with either M199/4% FBS alone or with VEGF (kindly provided by Dr. H. Weich, Braunschweig, Germany) for 18 h. All cells were pulsed with 1 μCi/ml [3H]thymidine (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Buckinghamshire, United Kingdom) for additional 6 h. DNA synthesis was stopped by removing the radioactive media, washing the cells with phosphate-buffered saline, and fixing them with ice-cold methanol and 5% trichloroacetic acid. Finally, the acid-insoluble fractions were lysed in 0.3 nNaOH (0.2 ml/well) and the radioactivity was determined in liquid scintillation counter. Each experiment included six wells for each condition tested. All results are expressed as mean ± S.E. percentage over that of control, which is taken as 0%, from one representative experiment. Results were compared by unpaired t test. Cell proliferation assays were performed using the 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-dimethyltetrazolium bromide (MTT, Sigma) method (30Carmichael J. Degraff W.C. Gazdar A.F. Minna J.D. Mitchell J.B. Cancer Res. 1987; 47: 943-946PubMed Google Scholar). HUVECs were grown in 24-well gelatin-coated plates (5000 cells/well) for 2 days and then starved by incubation in M199/4% FBS for 24 h. The cells were then preincubated with M199/1% BSA alone or with thrombin for 8 h. Subsequently, the cells were incubated with either M199/4% FBS alone or with VEGF for 2 days. MTT stock solution (5 mg/ml) was added to each well equal to 0.1 original culture volume. After 3 h of incubation, the medium was removed and the reduced dye was solubilized from the attached cells with acidic isopropanol. Absorbance (570 nm) of the Formazan product was measured as an index of cell proliferation. Each experiment included six wells for each condition tested. All results are expressed as mean ± S.E. percentage over that of control, which is taken as 0%, from one representative experiment. Results were compared by unpaired t test. After reaching confluence and 3 days after the last medium change, HUVECs were growth factor-starved by incubation with M199/4% FBS for 24 h. Subsequently, cells were incubated with M199/1% BSA alone or with thrombin or with TRAP. For signal transduction experiments, calphostin C (Sigma), PD98059 (a generous gift by Dr. A. Saltiel, Parke-Davis/Warner-Lambert, Ann Arbor, MI) and forskolin (Sigma) were added in cell culture medium 30 min before thrombin stimulation. After the indicated time periods, total cellular RNA was purified by the guanidinium thiocyanate-phenol chloroform method (31Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63191) Google Scholar) RT-PCR was performed using the Promega access RT-PCR system (Promega, Madison, WI) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Primer sequences (all synthesized by Research and Technology Institute, Heraklion, Greece) were as follows: KDR (32Hewett P.W. Murray J.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 221: 697-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) (sense, 5′-AGACTTTGAGCATGGAAG-3′; antisense, 5′-CCATTCCACCAAAAGATG-3′; expected size of the PCR product, 312 bp), flt-1 (18De Vries C. Escobedo J.A. Ueno H. Houck H.K. Ferrara N. Williams L.T. Science. 1992; 255: 989-991Crossref PubMed Scopus (1893) Google Scholar) (sense, 5′-GATGTCGACGGT-ATAAATACACATGTGCTTCTAG-3′; antisense, 5′-CTATGGAAGATCTGATTTCTTACAGT-3′; expected size of PCR product, 1080 bp), and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) as internal control (33Maier J.A.M. Voulalas P. Roeder D. Maciag T. Science. 1990; 249: 1570-1574Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar) (sense, 5′-CCACCCATGGCAAATTCCATGGCA-3′; antisense, 5′-TCTAGACGGCAGGTCAGGTCCACC-3′; expected size of PCR product, 597 bp). The RT-PCR profile consisted of 45 min at 48 °C for reverse transcription and 5 min of initial denaturation at 94 °C followed by 20–40 cycles of 1 min of denaturation at 94 °C, 1 min of annealing at 56 °C, 2 min of polymerization at 72 °C and finally 10 min of extension at 72 °C. Ten microliters of the RT-PCR products were separated in 2% (w/v) agarose gels and stained with ethidium bromide. The gels were then photographed and scanned to quantitate the obtained RT-PCR products. To correct for differences in RNA used in RT-PCR reactions, the signal intensity for each PT-PCR product of KDR and flt-1 was divided by that of GAPDH, for which reverse transcription and cDNA amplification was performed in the same PT-PCR reaction tube with KDR or flt-1. To exclude potential genomic DNA contamination in the RNA preparations, samples were either first treated with DNase and then used in RT-PCR, or RNA was directly used in PCR amplification. In the former case, the expected PCR products were observed, while in the latter case, nonspecific PCR products were detected (data not shown). Nuclei of endothelial cells were isolated, and run-on t ranscription experiments were performed as described by Kananaugh et al. (34Kavanaugh W.M. Harsh G.R., IV Starksen N.F. Rocco C.M. Williams L.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 8470-8472Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with modifications. Three days after the last medium change, starved confluent HUVECs were incubated with M199/1% BSA alone or with thrombin (1.5 IU/ml) for 8 h. Cells were then lysed by scraping in ice-cold nuclear extraction buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm NaCl, 3 mm MgCl2, and 0.5% (v/v) Nonidet P-40) and placed on ice for 15 min. The nuclei were pelleted at 500 × g at 4 °C for 5 min and washed once in the nuclear extraction buffer. Following an RNase (Promega) digestion for 30 min on ice, the nuclei were washed, centrifuged, and resuspended in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 75 mmNaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 50% (v/v) glycerol to a concentration of 1 × 107nuclei/100 μl. The samples were snap-frozen in liquid N2and stored at −80 °C until use. For nuclear run-on analysis, 100 μl of nuclei suspension were incubated in a total reaction mixture of 250 μl containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mm mgCl2, 0.5 MnCl2, 100 mm KCl, 0.25 mg/ml BSA, 50 μM EDTA, 1 mm S-adenosylmethionine (Promega), 1 mm dithiothreitol, 500 IU/ml RNasin (Promega), 0.5 mm each of CTP, ATP, UTP, GTP (Promega). The incubation was at 28 °C for 60 min. Under these conditions, the rate of transcription in HUVEC nuclei is linear for at least 1 h (Fig. 6). The reaction was terminated by adding 15 units of DNase (Promega) at 28 °C for 15 min. The samples were then deproteinized by addition of equal volume of 200 μg/ml proteinase K (Promega), 0.4% SDS, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and 10 mm EDTA and incubated at 37 °C for 60 min. Newly synthesized RNA transcripts were isolated by the guanidinium thiocyanate-phenol-chloroform method (31Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63191) Google Scholar), and the determination of KDR and GAPDH transcription rates was performed using quantitative RT-PCR, as described above in detail. Confluent and starved endothelial cells were incubated with M199/1% BSA alone or with thrombin (1.5 IU/ml) for 8 h, before addition of actinomycin D (10 μg/ml). Cells were then harvested at varying time points, ranging from 1 to 8 h. Total RNA was extracted (31Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63191) Google Scholar) from cells, and the levels of KDR and GAPDH transcripts were determined by quantitative RT-PCR as described above. Three days after the last medium change, starved confluent endothelial monolayers were incubated with M199/1% BSA alone or with thrombin (1.5 IU/ml) for 12 h. Cells were then lysed at 4 °C by scraping in lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.14 m NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% deoxycholate acid, 0.02% NaN3, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm N-ethylmaleimide, 1 IU/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin (all were purchased from Sigma). Protein samples (1 mg) were precleared with 100 μl of protein A-Sepharose (Sigma) conjugated with normal rabbit IgG (Sigma) for 3 h at 4 °C. After a brief centrifugation, the supernatants were mixed with 10 μl of protein A-Sepharose conjucated with affinity-purified anti-KDR rabbit polyclonal antibody (generous gift from Dr. H. Weich, National Research Center for Biotechnology, Braunschweig, Germany) and rotated overnight at 4 °C. The antigen-antibody-protein A-Sepharose conjugates were removed by centrifugation and washed five times with wash buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.4 mNaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% deoxycholate acid, 0.02% NaN3, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm N-ethylmaleimide, 1 IU/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin). Protein were then denatured by boiling in Laemmli sample buffer (62.5 mmTris-HCl, pH 6.8, 20% glycerol, 2% SDS, 5% β-mercaptoethanol) for 5 min and electrophoresed on 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels (SDS-PAGE) under reducing conditions by method of Laemmli (35Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207233) Google Scholar). After electrophoresis, proteins on gels were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad, München, Germany). The obtained membranes were blocked with 5% skim milk in PBS, overnight at 4 °C and then incubated with anti-KDR rabbit polyclonal antibody at 1 μg/ml in blocking buffer for 2 h at room temperature. After washing with PBS, the membranes were incubated with anti-rabbit IgG conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (Sigma) in PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 for 1 h at room temperature. The membranes were then washed with Tween-PBS, and the blots were developed using enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's protocol. In order to quantitate functional KDR receptors present in HUVECs treated with thrombin, phosphorylated forms of KDR were identified after exposure to VEGF. Starved endothelial cells were incubated for 12 h with M199/1% BSA alone or with thrombin and stimulated for the last 15 min with VEGF. Lysis of cells, immunoprecipitation with anti-KDR rabbit polyclonal antibody, SDS-PAGE protein separation, and transfer to nitrocellulose membrane were performed as described in details above. The blocked membranes were then immunoblotted with 0.1 μg/ml RC20H anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase.(kindly provided by Dr. E. Dejana, Mario Negri, Milan, Italy) for 3 h at room temperature. After extensive washing with Tween-PBS immunoreactive bands were visualized using the ECL reagent. Mitogenic activity of endothelial cells can be stimulated by a variety of growth factors, including VEGF and thrombin (11Kanthou C. Kakkar V.V. Benzakour O. Maragoudakis M.E. Angiogenesis Models, Modulators, and Clinical Applications. 298. Plenum Press, New York1998: 263-282Crossref Google Scholar, 12Ferrara N. Davis-Smyth T. Endocr. Rev. 1997; 18: 4-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (3668) Google Scholar). In the experiments described in this report, thrombin (1.5 IU/ml) caused a significant increase in DNA synthesis by HUVECS ranging from 40% to 90% over that of controls. Similarly, VEGF (5 ng/ml) caused an even greater stimulation of DNA synthesis by HUVECS ranging from 160% to 280% above the controls. When HUVECS were preincubated with thrombin for 8–12 h and subsequently exposed to VEGF, the increase in DNA synthesis by these cells was greater than the additive effect expected from thrombin and VEGF alone (Fig.1 A). The thrombin-treated cells responded to VEGF-induced DNA synthesis in this synergistic way only at least 8 h after exposure to thrombin. At earlier times: 0.5, 1.5, and 4 h, this potentiating effect of thrombin on VEGF-induced DNA synthesis was not evident (Fig. 1 A). The effect is specific to thrombin since hirudin completely cancels out this effect (Table I). Additionally, PPACK-thrombin (chemically inactivated thrombin at the active site) is without effect, thus establishing the requirement for a proteolytic activation of thrombin receptors on endothelial cells (Table I). This effect of thrombin was dose-dependent and reached a plateau at about 1.5 IU/ml thrombin (Fig.2 A).Table ISpecificity of the effect of thrombin on VEGF-induced DNA synthesisTreatmentPercentage over control ± S.E.TreatmentPercentage over control ± S.E.None/control0None/control0Thr (1.5 IU/ml)90 ± 4Thr (1.5 IU/ml)59 ± 2PPACK-Thr (25 μg/ml)29 ± 14Hirudin (1.5 IU/ml)3 ± 6VEGF (5 ng/ml)299 ± 21VEGF (5 ng/ml)215 ± 15Thr/VEGF659 ± 33Thr + hirudin11 ± 9PPACK-Thr/VEGF303 ± 13Thr/VEGF489 ± 23Thr + hirudin/VEGF268 ± 12HUVECs were preincubated for 12 h with M199/1% BSA alone or with thrombin (Thr), PPACK-thrombin, hirudin, and the combination thrombin plus hirudin.

Subsequently the cells were incubated either with M199, 4% FBS alone, or with VEGF for 18 h. All cells were pulsed with [3H]-thymidine for additional 6 h. Many of the effects of thrombin are mimicked by TRAP, the decatetrapeptide representing the NH2-terminal sequence of the activated thrombin receptor (36Grand R.J.A. Turnell A.S. Grabham R.W. Biochem. J. 1996; 313: 353-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). TRAP bypasses the requirement for proteolysis of the thrombin receptor for activation and acts as tethered agonist peptide of the activated receptor (37Vu T.K.H. Hung D.T. Wheaton V.I. Coughlin S.R. Cell. 1991; 69: 1057-1068Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (2675) Google Scholar). As shown in Figs. 1 B and 2 B, TRAP has the same effects as thrombin on the VEGF-induced DNA synthesis. As with thrombin, incubation of cells for at least 8 h subsequent to TRAP treatment is essential for the increase of VEGF-induced DNA synthesis to become evident (Fig. 1 B). The synergistic effect of thrombin on VEGF-induced DNA synthesis was also investigated at the level of endothelial cell proliferation. Cells were preincubated with thrombin (1.5 IU/ml) for 8 h and subsequently with VEGF (5 ng/ml) for 2 days. The cell growth was determined colormetrically. Thrombin or VEGF alone caused about 20% and 100% increase in cell proliferation rate, respectively (Fig.3). When cells were pretreated with thrombin and subsequently exposed to VEGF, the increase in cell proliferation was about 220% over controls (Fig. 3). This is in line with the results obtained by monitoring DNA synthesis. Taken together, these data show that thrombin enhances effectively the mitogenic potency of VEGF on endothelial cells. We next determined whether the potentiating effect of thrombin on VEGF-induced endothelial cells mitogenesis could be related, at least in part, to regulation by thrombin of VEGF receptors. We employed a sensitive quantitative RT-PCR technique to examine KDR and flt-1 gene expression in HUVECs. Primers for KDR, flt-1, and GAPDH were chosen so that they would correspond to the regions where sequence homologies among the three primers are relatively low and would generate products of differing lengths. This allowed us to perform RT-PCR with the housekeeping gene GAPDH into the same reaction tubes with KDR or flt-1. Data presented in this report show that each set of primers worked well in specifying their corresponding mRNA. Single bands at about 312, 596, and 1080 bp were obtained for KDR, GAPDH, and flt-1 mRNA, respectively. Titration curves of RT-PCR products have been employed for determining the quantitative range in which the reactions proceeded exponentially (data not shown). Signal intensities of the products obtained were plotted as functions of RNA template amount and cycle number. Thus, we established the optimal conditions for RT-PCR, which were performed with 250 ng of total RNA for 25 cycles for KDR/GAPDH and 500 ng of total RNA and 30 cycles for flt-1/GAPDH. As shown in Fig.4, treatment of HUVECs with thrombin (1.5 IU/ml) resulted in increase in the message for KDR as compared with untreated cells (about 170% over of that controls). The up-regulation of KDR mRNA was evident 8–12 h after thrombin stimulation. At earlier times (2 and 4 h) or after 16 h of thrombin treatment, the mRNA levels of KDR in the thrombin-treated cells were comparable to control endothelial cells (Fig. 4). A similar increase in mRNA for flt-1 was also evident 8 h after thrombin stimulation (Fig. 8).Figure 8The up-regulation of flt-1 receptor mRNA by thrombin involves the activated thrombin receptor and is mediated by PKC and MAP kinase signaling pathways.

Reprod. Toxicol. 1991; 5: 179-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 9Guenthner T.M. Mulder G.J. Conjugation Reactions in Drug Metabolism.

Res. 1983; 135: 81-105PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast to this protective effect, mEH is thought to be required for the metabolic activation of the potent carcinogen 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA), a widely studied experimental prototype for the polycylic aromatic hydrocarbon class of chemical carcinogens (12Phillips D.H. Grover P.L. Drug. Metab. Rev. 1994; 26: 443-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). P450s and mEH metabolize DMBA to both inert metabolites and metabolites that are electrophilic and capable of producing DNA adducts (Fig. 1). Cytochrome P450 CYP1B1 oxidizes DMBA to the 3,4-epoxide (13Christou M. Savas U. Spink D.C. Gierthy J.F. Jefcoate C.R. Carcinogenesis. 1994; 15: 725-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). This is followed by hydrolysis of the epoxide by mEH to the proximate carcinogenic metabolite, DMBA-3,4-diol. This metabolite can be further oxidized by either CYP1A1 or CYP1B1 to the principal ultimate carcinogenic metabolite, DMBA-3,4-diol-1,2-epoxide, that is capable of producing DNA adducts (14Dipple A. Nebzydoski J.A. Chem. Biol. Interact. 1978; 20: 17-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 15Tierney B. Hewer A. MacNicoll A.D. Giovanni Gervasi P. Rattle H. Walsh C. Grover P.L. Sims P. Chem.

Jovanovich M.C. Jefcoate C.R. Carcinogenesis. 1989; 10: 1883-1890Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Other ring hydroxylations and methyl hydroxylations of DMBA result in inactive metabolites that do not bind DNA. Based on this scheme, mEH should be a critical enzyme in the pathway leading to the carcinogenic activity of DMBA. However a role for mEH in DMBA carcinogenesis has not been established in an intact animal model. DMBA carcinogenesis bioassays have been established using mouse skin with either the two stage initiation-promotion protocol in which DMBA is initially applied followed by repeated applications of 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), or the complete carcinogenesis assay where DMBA is continuously applied (18Lau H.H. Coffing S.L. Lee H. Harvey R.G. Baird W.M. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1995; 8: 970-978Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 19DiGiovanni J. Slaga T.J. Boutwell R.K.

Cancer Res. 1981; 41: 773-779PubMed Google Scholar). In the two stage carcinogenesis model, metabolites of DMBA cause DNA adducts and TPA administration results in cell proliferation that serves to fix the mutations in cell cycle control genes leading to selection of rapidly dividing cancer cells. In the complete carcinogenesis scheme, DMBA serves as both an initiator and promoter of cell growth. It is not known whether the mechanism of carcinogenesis differs between the two protocols. The mouse skin cancer bioassays can be used to determine the effects of genes on DMBA carcinogenesis. In this report, mEH-null mice were produced and found to have no phenotype, indicating that in mice, mEH is not essential for reproduction and physiological homeostasis. Using the two widely used skin cancer bioassays discussed above, mEH-null mice were found to be highly resistant to DMBA-induced carcinogenesis. The mouse mEH cDNA was isolated from a liver cDNA library (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) using the rat mEH as a probe (21Gonzalez F.J. Kasper C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 4697-4700Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mouse soluble EH (sEH) cDNA was isolated by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Total RNA was isolated from livers of 8-week-old male C57BL/6 mice using the Ultraspec RNA reagent according to the manufacturer's protocol (Biotecx Laboratories, Houston, TX). Primers were generated from the 5′ (GGGAATTCATGGCGCTGCGTGTAGCCGCG) and 3′ (GGGAATTCCTAAATCTTGGAGGTCACTGA) ends of the sEH cDNA sequence (22Grant D.F. Storms D.H. Hammock B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17628-17633Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and were used to amplify the cDNA using the cDNA Cycle Kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). The resultant cDNA was completely sequenced using an Applied Biosystems Model 377 sequencer (Foster City, CA). The mEH genomic clones were obtained from a mouse 129/Sv Lambda FIX genomic library (Stratagene) using the mouse mEH cDNA as a probe. A 5.5-kbp Bam HI fragment containing exon 2 was isolated from the genomic clone and subcloned into pUC18. To disrupt the gene, an Apa I fragment containing a part of exon 2 was deleted and replaced with the bacterial phosphoribosyltransferase II gene cassette (TK-NEO) derived from the pMC1Neo poly(A) vector including Apa I adapters (Stratagene). A herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase gene was inserted at the 3′ end of mEH gene for use in negative selection with gancyclovir. The plasmid DNA used for targeting was purified by banding twice on cesium chloride gradients, linearized with Sal I and introduced into embryonic stem (ES) cells purchased from Genome Systems Inc. (St. Louis, MO) by electroporation at 250 V, 250 μF capacitance using a Bio-Rad gene pulser. One day after electroporation, the ES cells were incubated in medium containing G418 (300 μg/ml) and gancyclovir (5 μm) as positive and negative selectable markers, respectively. The surviving ES cell clones were analyzed by Southern blotting using a probe corresponding to exon 3 and exon 4 of the mEH gene. The probes were derived from the mEH cDNA. The TK-NEO gene was used to identify specific homologous recombinants and eliminate clones having other nonspecific integration of the targeting construct. The ES cell clones heterozygous for the disrupted mEH gene were injected into C57BL/6 blastocysts to generate chimeric founder mice as described previously (23Lee S.S. Pineau T. Drago J. Lee E.J.

The injected blastocysts were transferred into the uterus of pseudopregnant recipient NIH Swiss females to produce chimeric mice. Male chimeras were bred with C57BL/6 females to determine whether germ line transmission had occurred. The heterozygous mice, having germ line transmission of the targeted mEH allele, were interbred to generate homozygotes. Genomic DNA was isolated from ES cells and mouse tails (24Laird P.W. Zijderveld A. Linders K. Rudnicki M.A. Jaenisch R. Berns A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 4293Crossref PubMed Scopus (1303) Google Scholar) and digested with Xba I and Eco RI. The digested DNA was subjected to electrophoresis in 0.6% agarose gels, transferred to a Gene Screen Plus nylon membrane (NEN Life Science Products) using 0.4 nNaOH, and hybridized with the mEH probe. Mouse liver tissue was homogenized in Ultraspec RNA reagent (Biotecx Laboratories). Total RNA (10 μg) was denatured and subjected to electrophoresis in 1% agarose gels containing 2.2 m formaldehyde and blotted to Gene Screen Plus nylon membranes. mEH and sEH cDNAs were labeled with [α-32P]dCTP using a random primer polymerase kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The conditions used for prehybridization, hybridization, and washing were previously described (23Lee S.S. Pineau T. Drago J. Lee E.J. Owens J.W. Kroetz D.L. Fernandez-Salguero P.M. Westphal H. Gonzalez F.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3012-3022Crossref PubMed Scopus (1506) Google Scholar). Liver microsomal protein (10 μg) was subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Protein was electroblotted to nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher & Schuell), and the immune complexes were detected by use of ECL reagent (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Rabbit antibody prepared against rat mEH was kindly provided by Dr. James P. Hardwick (Northeastern Ohio University College of Medicine). Mice at gestation day 14 were euthanized by carbon dioxide asphyxiation, and the embryos were placed in phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4). Following removal of internal organs and head, the remaining torsos were minced and placed into 2 ml of 0.25% trypsin for 45 min at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped by addition of incubation medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 μg/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 250 μg/ml amphotericin B and 2 mm glutamine). The cells were grown at 37 °C in 5% carbon dioxide until confluent, trypsinized, and stored at −80 °C until use. The cells were thawed before use, grown for 1 day, trypsinized, and seeded into 96-well plates at a density of 3,000 cells/well in 100 μl of medium. Following incubation for 1 day, a series of dilutions of DMBA in 100 μl of medium were added to the cells and incubation continued for 3 days. The cells were fixed with 10% trichloroacetic acid, washed, and stained with sulforhodamine B (25Skehan P. Storeng R. Scudiero D. Monks A. McMahon J. Vistica D. Warren J.T. Bokesch H. Kenney S.

For metabolism studies, [3H]DMBA (1,033 mCi/mmol), purified by reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography to remove impurities and dissolved in Me2SO, was incubated with 1.4 × 106 embryo-derived fibroblast (EF) cells in 5 ml of medium (the final concentration of DMBA was 0.3 μm) for 24 h. The cells were mechanically harvested and extracted with 1 volume of cold acetone, and the aqueous phase was extracted twice with 10 ml of ethyl acetate. The combined organic phase was dried, and the residues were analyzed by reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography with a radio-detector (26Shou M. Korzekwa K.R. Krausz K.W. Buters J.T.

DMBA 8,9-dihydrodiol (8,9-diol) was formed by incubation of DMBA with human recombinant CYP1A1 (Gentest Corp., Woburn, MA) (26Shou M. Korzekwa K.R. Krausz K.W. Buters J.T. Grogan J. Goldfarb I.

The mice were initiated by treating once with 25 μg of DMBA in 200 μl of acetone, and 1 week later, they were treated with 5 μg of TPA (Mallinckrodt Baker, Inc., Paris, KY) in 200 μl of acetone. TPA was administered three times weekly for 25 weeks. As a control, wild-type mice were initiated with only acetone and promoted with TPA. For the complete carcinogenesis experiments, the mice received weekly applications of 12.8 μg of DMBA in 200 μl of acetone for 25 weeks. Skin papillomas greater than 1 mm in diameter were counted and the incidence was monitored weekly. To investigate the developmental and physiological function of mEH and its role in chemical carcinogenesis, mEH-null mice were generated using the classical strategy of homologous recombination in ES cells. The mouse mEH gene was isolated and characterized and found to span 29 kbp (Fig.2 A) and have 9 exons (TableI), similar to the human and rat mEH genes (28Hassett C. Robinson K.B. Beck N.B.

The mouse mEH cDNA was isolated from a mouse liver cDNA library, and the nucleotide sequences of the exon portions in the mouse mEH gene were identical to those of the cDNA.Table IExon-intron junctions of the mEH geneExonIntronExon1CCCTGACAgtaagctc1tctcccagGAGTCATG22AGATCAAGgtgagaca2cactgcagGACTTGCA33GATTGAAGgtgagatt3tgccccagGGCTGGAC44CAAGAAAGgtacaggg4tcactcagGTTTAAAT55GTGCCCAAgtgagttt5gcctacagCCACGTGA66CACTGTGGgtaagcac6ccatccagGCTGTGCT77CTGGAGAGgtgaggcc7tttcccagGAAGTTCT88CATGAGGGgtaagcct8ccccacagGATGAAGG9The mEH gene was partially sequenced using primers derived from the mEH cDNA.

Only the sequences flanking the exons are included. A 5.5-kbp Bam HI fragment containing exon 2 was used to make a vector for targeted gene disruption. A 0.7-kbp Apa I fragment containing a part of exon 2 was replaced with 1.1-kbp TK-NEO cassette encoding the NEO selectable marker (Fig. 2 B). To allow the use of gancyclovir for negative selection, the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase gene expression cassette was inserted into 3′ end of the targeting vector. The linearized targeting construct was electroporated into ES cells, and four ES cell homologous recombinant clones were found out of the 220 G418- and gancyclovir-resistant clones analyzed. Southern blot analysis demonstrated that heterozygous ES clones were obtained as indicated by the presence of an additional 7.7-kbp fragment obtained upon double digestion with Xba I and Eco RI (data not shown). When these clones were hybridized with the TK-NEO gene as a probe, only a single hybridizing band of 7.7-kbp with Xba I-Eco RI double-digested DNA was detected, demonstrating that these clones did not contain any additional random integrations of the targeting construct. One of these homologous recombinant ES cell clones was injected into C57BL/6 blastocysts and seven male chimeric mice were generated; one of these yielded germline transmission. Heterozygous (mEH+/−) mice were normal and used for interbreeding to generate homozygous (mEH−/− or mEH-null) mice. Breeding of the heterozygous mice produced offspring at the expected Mendelian distribution indicating that no in utero lethality occurs as a result of loss of the functional mEH gene. The mEH+/− and mEH−/− mice DNAs were analyzed for the presence of mutant alleles of the mEH gene (Fig. 2 C). The absence of a diagnostic 10.5-kbp band and the presence of a 7.7-kbp band in the offspring clearly indicated that the mEH-null mice were born and viable. mEH-null mice exhibited no differences in weight, development, fertility and behavior when compared with their wild-type littermate controls. The finding of no effect on fertility and reproduction was quite surprising, because mEH is expressed in the ovary and testis (30Oesch F. Glatt H. Schimassmann H. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1977; 26: 603-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Histological examination of several other organs, including liver, lung, kidney, intestine, spleen, thymus, heart, and brain, revealed no difference between mEH-null and wild-type mice, indicating that mEH is not a critical requirement for normal development and physiology. This finding of no apparent role in development and physiological homeostasis was of interest, because the enzyme is highly conserved at the level of amino acid sequence similarity (31Porter T.D. Beck T.W. Kasper C.B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1986; 248: 121-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 32Skoda R.C. Demierre A. McBride O.W. Gonzalez F.J. Meyer U.A. J. Biol.

To evaluate the level of mEH mRNA, Northern blot analysis was performed (Fig. 3). As a control, sEH mRNA was also examined. sEH mRNA levels were not different among the mEH-null, mEH+/−, and wild-type mice. In the mEH-null mouse liver, a lower abundance RNA band (that was of slightly higher mobility than that seen in the wild-type mice) was detected using the mEH cDNA as a probe (Fig. 3). This transcript is probably derived from the disrupted allele although it is not certain how the TK-NEO cassette would alter splicing to produce a smaller mRNA. The lower level of expression of this transcript is not surprising, because mRNAs that do not encode a normal protein are typically unstable and rapidly degraded (34Lim S.K. Sigmund C.D. Gross K.W. Maquat L.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 1149-1161Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 35Zhang J. Maquat L.E. RNA. 1996; 2: 235-243PubMed Google Scholar). To further confirm that mEH protein is not expressed in the mEH-null mice, immunoblot analysis was performed using rabbit antibody against rat mEH. mEH protein was not detected in the mEH-null mouse liver microsomes (Fig. 4). The data confirm that the mEH is not expressed in the mEH-null mice.Figure 4Western blot analysis of liver microsomes.

Cells that metabolically activate DMBA to electrophilic metabolites will be killed. Wild-type EF were killed by DMBA at less than 1 μm. In contrast, mEH-null EF were resistant to up to 10 μm of the carcinogen. These data suggest that cells lacking mEH are unable to catalyze the metabolic activation of DMBA. This was confirmed by direct analysis of DMBA metabolism by EF in situ. EF from wild-type mice were able to form the 3,4-diol metabolite that results from P450 oxidation to the 3,4-epoxide followed by hydrolysis to the diol by mEH (TableII). In contrast, no detectable DMBA-3,4-diol was formed in cells from mEH-null mice. These EF cells also failed to produce the 8,9-diol and 10,11-diol, whereas they were able to generate the phenol metabolites that result from hydrolysis of epoxides by water. These data indicate that cells from mEH-null mice are unable to produce the proximate carcinogenic metabolite of DMBA, the 3,4-diol, that is the precursor to the 3,4-diol-1,2-epoxide ultimate carcinogenic metabolite of DMBA.Table IIDMBA metabolism in mouse embryonic fibroblastSamplePercentage metabolite distribution3,4-diol8,9-diol10,11-diolPhenol A2-aPhenol A, DMBA 2-phenol + DMBA 3-phenol.Phenol B2-bPhenol B, DMBA 4-phenol.7M,12OH-DMBAWild-type8.6 ± 0.83.2 ± 0.911.8 ± 1.215.4 ± 0.60.5 ± 0.15.5 ± 0.5mEH-nullND2-cND, not detected.NDND23.0 ± 5.92.3 ± 1.110.6 ± 3.7Primary mouse embryo fibroblasts were incubated with 0.3 μm [3H]DMBA for 24 h.

To test the role of mEH in DMBA-induced carcinogenesis, skin cancer bioassays were carried out comparing the mEH-null with wild-type mice (Fig.6). The mEH-null allele is on a 129/Sv genetic background, and this stain is known to be sensitive to DMBA-induced skin carcinogenesis (36Reiners Jr., J.J. Singh K.P. Carcinogenesis. 1997; 18: 593-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). In a standard initiation-promotion protocol, wild-type mice started to develop papillomas after 6 weeks of TPA treatment, and the percentage of mice with tumors increased to 70% by 15 weeks (Fig. 6 A). This value is within the range of that found by others (37Hennings H. Lowry D.T. Yuspa S.H. Mock B. Potter M. Mol. Carcinogen. 1997; 20: 143-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The mean number of papillomas per mouse at 15 weeks of treatment was 4 (Fig.6 B). In contrast, papillomas first appeared in mEH-null mice at 9–10 weeks and the percentage of mice with tumors reached 20% at 17 weeks. The mean number of tumors per mouse in this group was 0.5 (Fig. 6 B). These data indicate that lack of mEH results in a marked resistance to DMBA-induced skin cancer thus demonstrating in an intact animal model that mEH is a major determinant for susceptibility to DMBA-induced cancer. In contrast to the initiation-promotion assay, mEH-null mice were completely resistant to skin cancer when a complete carcinogenesis assay was performed in which only DMBA was applied. After 25 weeks of treatment, almost 80% of wild-type mice had papillomas, whereas none of the mEH-null mice had even a single detectable nodule (Fig. 6, C and D). This is strong evidence that there are significant mechanistic differences between the initiation-promotion skin cancer bioassay and the complete carcinogenesis assay, which involve metabolic activation of DMBA. There are a large number of enzymes that are involved in the detoxification of carcinogens including microsomal and soluble epoxide hydrolases, UDP-glucuronosyltransferases, glutathione S-transferases, and diaphorase. Although mEH is generally considered a detoxification enzyme for arene oxides, its involvement in the hydrolysis of chemical intermediates, leading to the ultimate carcinogenic metabolite, has only been demonstrated in vitro and has not previously been demonstrated in an intact animal model (38Friedberg T. Becker R. Oesch F. Glatt H.R. Carcinogenesis. 1994; 15: 171-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In the complete carcinogenesis protocol, no cancers were found in the mEH-null mice thus establishing that mEH is required for the carcinogenicity of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons such as DMBA in vivo. In the initiation-promotion carcinogen bioassay, the null mice did develop papillomas albeit at levels significantly lower than in wild-type mice. These studies indicate a possible mechanistic difference between the complete carcinogenesis and the TPA initiation-promotion bioassays. It is well established that mEH is absolutely required for production of the bay region diol-epoxide of DMBA that is highly mutagenic (12Phillips D.H. Grover P.L. Drug. Metab. Rev. 1994; 26: 443-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). However, the fact that tumors were found in the mEH-null mice treated with TPA suggests the existence of a second pathway for activation of DMBA that is dependent on TPA. DMBA is known to cause elevated hydrogen peroxide and oxidized bases, particularly 8-hydroxy-2′-deoxyguanosine in epidermal DNA, although it is unknown whether this is dependent on P450 oxidation (39Frenkel K. Wei L. Wei H. Free. Radical Biol. Med. 1995; 19: 373-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Perhaps the active metabolites derived from this, or another P450 and mEH-independent pathway of DMBA activation such as that mediated by mutagenic sulfate esters (40Ogura K. Sohtome T. Sugiyama A. Okuda H. Hiratsuka A. Watabe T. Mol. Pharmacol. 1990; 37: 848-854PubMed Google Scholar), result in DNA adducts that are more readily repaired than those adducts produced by the DMBA diol-epoxide metabolite. Fixation of these adducts into mutations may require a strong hyperplastic response such as that found with TPA. These possibilities can now be investigated using the P450 and mEH null mouse models. Recent studies with the CYP1B1-null mouse have established that CYP1B1 is critical for DMBA carcinogenesis in vivo using an oral route of administration that results in lymphomas in wild-type mice (41Buters J.T. Sakai S. Richter T. Pineau T. Alexander D.L. Savas U. Doehmer J. Ward J.M. Jefcoate C.R. Gonzalez F.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1977-1982Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). These data support the in vitro evidence showing that CYP1B1 is considerably more active than CYP1A1 in producing the DMBA-3,4-diol proximate carcinogenic metabolite (13Christou M. Savas U. Spink D.C. Gierthy J.F. Jefcoate C.R. Carcinogenesis. 1994; 15: 725-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). These results establish that mEH is also required for DMBA carcinogenesis and validates the in vivo relevance of the bay region diol-epoxide pathway for metabolic activation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon carcinogens. These studies suggests that genetics differences in expression of P450s and mEH may be critical determinants of cancer susceptibility. In humans, hepatic mEH exhibits a wide range of expression levels between different people (42Hassett C. Lin J. Carty C.L. Laurenzana E.M. Omiecinski C.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 337: 275-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Polymorphic allelic variants in the mEH gene have also been described in humans (43Gaedigk A. Speilberg S.P. Grant D.M. Pharmacogenetics. 1994; 4: 142-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 44Hassett C. Aicher L. Sidhu J.S. Omiecinski C.J. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1994; 23: 433-442Google Scholar). Thus, it is thought that interindividual variation in mEH expression in the human population could play a role in cancer susceptibility, teratogenesis, and cytotoxicity (45Buehler B.A. Delimont D. van Waes M.

These studies will provide a mechanistic-based framework in an intact animal model for future efforts in molecular epidemiology to determine whether genetic polymorphisms in human mEH confer altered sensitivities to the toxic and carcinogenic effects of xenobiotics that damage cells through epoxide intermediates .

To study the structural and functional consequences of this mutation, human αA and αB crystallin genes were cloned and the conserved arginine residue (Arg-116 in αA crystallin and Arg-120 in αB crystallin) mutated to Cys and Gly, respectively, by site-directed mutagenesis. The recombinant wild-type and mutant proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified. The mutant and wild-type proteins were characterized by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, Western immunoblotting, gel permeation chromatography, fluorescence, and circular dichroism spectroscopy. Biophysical studies reveal significant differences between the wild-type and mutant proteins. The chaperone-like activity was studied by analyzing the ability of the recombinant proteins to prevent dithiothreitol-induced aggregation of insulin. The mutations R116C in αA crystallin and R120G in αB crystallin reduce the chaperone-like activity of these proteins significantly. Near UV circular dichroism and intrinsic fluorescence spectra indicate a change in tertiary structure of the mutants. Far UV circular dichroism spectra suggest altered packing of the secondary structural elements. Gel permeation chromatography reveals polydispersity for both of the mutant proteins. An appreciable increase in the molecular mass of the mutant αA crystallin is also observed. However, the change in oligomer size of the αB mutant is less significant. These results suggest that the conserved arginine of the α-crystallin domain of the small heat shock proteins is essential for their structural integrity and subsequent in vivo function."

It was therefore of interest to determine if the PI3K-PKB/Akt signaling pathway was capable of conferring protection from apoptosis induced by p53. We demonstrate in this report that constitutively active PI3K and PKB/Akt are capable of significantly delaying the onset of p53-mediated apoptosis. This was manifested as a delay in the kinetics of DNA degradation and cell death as well as a profound attenuation in the accumulation of cells with a sub-G1 DNA content. Moreover, we found that this effect is mediated in the absence of changes in expression of Bcl-2, Bcl-Xl, and the pro-apoptotic protein Bax.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 5034-5037Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar). v-Akt was generated by a fusion event that juxtaposes the retroviral glycosaminoglycan protein and the entire coding region of PKB/Akt (2Coffer P.J.

Taken together, these results indicate that PI3K can function as an upstream activator of PKB/Akt and can regulate the ability of PDK-1 to modulate PKB/Akt activityPI3K is a heterodimeric lipid kinase consisting of a p85 regulatory subunit and a p110 catalytic subunit and is capable of triggering a plethora of biological responses (14Vanhaesebroeck B.

The binding of PI3K to upstream signaling molecules leads to the recruitment of p85-p110 heterodimeric complexes to the plasma membrane and the subsequent activation of the p110 catalytic subunit. The activated p110 catalytic subunit phosphorylates inositol lipids at the 3-position of the inositol ring, thereby generating the phospholipid second messenger molecules required for the transposition of PKB/Akt and PDK-1 to the plasma membrane.Cytokines, growth factors, and certain oncogenes have been shown to be effective inhibitors of apoptosis, and in many situations, this anti-apoptotic effect is mediated by the PI3K-induced activation of PKB/Akt (18Yao R.

IGF-1 inhibits UV-induced apoptosis in fibroblasts and prevents apoptosis in neuronal cells in response to growth factor withdrawal (21Kulik G. Klippel A. Weber M.J. Mol. Cell.

In both cases, IGF-1-mediated protection from apoptosis is abrogated either by pharmacological inhibitors of PI3K or by dominant-negative PKB/Akt constructs. Moreover, constitutively active PI3K or PKB/Akt mimics the anti-apoptotic function of IGF-1. Ras activates the PI3K-PKB/Akt signaling pathway by interacting directly with the p110 catalytic subunit of PI3K (16Rodriguez-Viciana P. Warne P.H. Khwaja A. Marte B.M. Pappin D. Das P.

Ras-induced activation of the PI3K-PKB/Akt signaling pathway confers protection from apoptosis in fibroblasts in response to oncogenic Myc and protects epithelial cells from apoptosis induced by anoikis (22Kennedy S.G.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2783-2793Crossref PubMed Scopus (932) Google Scholar). In this respect, PI3K-PKB/Akt-mediated survival contributes to the ability of Ras to function as an oncogene.The p53 tumor suppressor protein is a transcription factor capable of inducing either growth arrest or apoptosis (27Gottlieb T.M. Oren M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1287: 77-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar, 28Levine A.J.

In response to DNA damage, p53 induces a G1-specific cell cycle arrest by transcriptionally up-regulating the expression of the cyclin/Cdk inhibitor, p21/WAF-1-Cip1. This allows cells time to repair damaged DNA before progressing into S phase (30el-Deiry W.S. Tokino T. Velculescu V.E. Levy D.B. Parsons R. Trent J.M. Lin D. Mercer W.E. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Cell. 1993; 75: 817-825Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7890) Google Scholar, 31Hartwell L.H. Kastan M.B. Science. 1994; 266: 1821-1828Crossref PubMed Scopus (2303) Google Scholar). However, in response to oncogenic activation and/or growth factor withdrawal, p53 can induce apoptosis. p53-mediated apoptosis in certain cell types requires a transcriptionally functional p53. In this respect, the p53-inducible proteins Bax and IGF-binding protein-3 have been shown to be capable of inducing apoptosis. The inhibition of p53-mediated apoptosis in vivo potentiates the rate at which a tumor progresses to the stage of malignancy, and this is thought to be a major reason why p53 is so often mutated in human cancers.The cytokine IL-3 is a potent inhibitor of p53-mediated apoptosis in erythroleukemia cells (32Lin Y. Benchimol S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6045-6054Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In addition, the IL-3-mediated activation of JAK kinase is sufficient to protect myeloid cells from p53-mediated apoptosis in response to γ-radiation (33Quelle F.W. Wang J. Feng J. Wang D. Cleveland J.L. Ihle J.N. Zambetti G.P. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1099-1107Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). IL-3 is also a well established activator of the PI3K-PKB/Akt survival pathway (19Songyang Z. Baltimore D. Cantley L.C. Kaplan D.R. Franke T.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11345-11350Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). Moreover, p53-mediated apoptosis in baby rat kidney (BRK) cell lines transformed by E1A and tsp53(Val-135) (where ts is temperature-sensitive) is suppressed by oncogenic Ras (34Lin H.J. Eviner V. Prendergast G.C. White E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4536-4544Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). These findings indicate that p53-mediated apoptosis is inhibitable under conditions in which the PI3K-PKB/Akt survival pathway is activated.In light of these findings, it was of interest to determine if the PI3K-PKB/Akt signaling pathway was capable of conferring protection from apoptosis induced by p53. To this end, we employed a well characterized cell culture system in which apoptosis is exclusively p53-dependent (35Sabbatini P. Lin J. Levine A.J. White E. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2184-2192Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar, 36Sakamuro D. Sabbatini P. White E. Prendergast G.C. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 887-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 37Chiou S.K. Rao L. White E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2556-2563Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar, 38Debbas M. White E. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 546-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (831) Google Scholar). Using this cell culture system, we demonstrate that both constitutively active PI3K and PKB/Akt compromise the onset of p53-mediated apoptosis. Moreover, we find that this effect is mediated in the absence of changes in expression of Bcl-2, Bcl-Xl, and the pro-apoptotic protein Bax. These results provide the first unambiguous and compelling evidence that the PI3K-PKB/Akt survival pathway can protect from apoptosis induced by the p53 tumor suppressor protein.DISCUSSIONWe demonstrate in this report that both PI3K and PKB/Akt are capable of compromising the onset of apoptosis induced exclusively by the tumor suppressor protein p53. This was manifested as a significant delay in the kinetics of DNA degradation and cell death as well as a profound attenuation in the accumulation of cells with a sub-G1 DNA content. The protection from p53-mediated apoptosis conferred by PI3K and PKB/Akt was not permanent, as both the Akt-1 and 110-1 cell lines ultimately succumbed to cell death at the permissive temperature. One possible explanation for this observation centers around the mechanism by which p53-mediated, transcriptionally dependent apoptosis is induced.p53-mediated apoptosis in BRK cell lines transformed by E1A and tsp53(Val-135) is transcriptionally dependent and is triggered by a class of enzymes known as caspases (44Sabbatini P. Han J. Chiou S.K. Nicholson D.W. White E. Cell Growth Differ. 1997; 8: 643-653PubMed Google Scholar, 46Rao L. Perez D. White E. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1441-1455Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar). Caspases are a family of aspartate-specific proteases that induce apoptosis by cleaving and inactivating cellular substrates, which play an essential role in maintaining cell viability (47Nicholson D.W. Nat. Biotechnol. 1996; 14: 297-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Apoptosis in mammalian cells results from the activation of caspases in a cascade-like fashion, with initiator caspases lying at the apex of the cascade and effector caspases lying farther downstream (48Cryns V. Yuan J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1551-1570Crossref PubMed Scopus (1160) Google Scholar, 49Thornberry N.A. Lazebnik Y. Science. 1998; 281: 1312-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (6133) Google Scholar). Caspase-9 is an initiator caspase that becomes activated by the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria in response to many apoptotic stimuli (reviewed in Ref. 50Nunez G. Benedict M.A. Hu Y. Inohara N. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 3237-3245Crossref PubMed Scopus (944) Google Scholar). Recent evidence indicates that PKB/Akt can phosphorylate and inactivate caspase-9 and thereby abrogate caspase-9-mediated apoptosis (51Cardone M.H. Roy N. Stennicke H.R. Salvesen G.S. Franke T.F. Stanbridge E. Frisch S. Reed J.C. Science. 1998; 282: 1318-1321Crossref PubMed Scopus (2719) Google Scholar). Thus, in certain cell types, PKB/Akt may abrogate apoptosis through the direct inhibition of caspases. Constitutively active PKB/Akt was capable of abrogating the early stages of p53-mediated apoptosis, but was incapable of conferring protection at later time points (Fig. 2). Therefore, it is tempting to speculate that the early stages of p53-mediated, transcriptionally dependent apoptosis are triggered by initiator caspases such as caspase-9 that are inhibitable by PKB/Akt. A role for capsase-9 in p53-mediated apoptosis per se is implicated by the observation that dominant-negative caspase-9 constructs can inhibit apoptosis induced by E1A and Bax (52Seol D.-W. Billiar T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2072-2076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 53Fearnhead H.O. Rodriguez J. Govek E.E. Guo W. Kobayashi R. Hannon G. Lazebnik Y.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13664-13669Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Moreover, a recent study indicates that the inactivation of caspase-9 can substitute for p53 loss in permitting the oncogenic transformation of primary mouse embryo fibroblasts by c-Myc (54Soengas M.S. Alarcón R.M. Yoshida H. Giaccia A.J. Hakem R. Mak T.W. Lowe S.W. Science. 1999; 284: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar). Experiments to determine if caspase-9 is activated at the permissive temperature in BRK cell lines transformed by E1A and tsp53(Val-135) are in progress.The pro-apoptotic protein Bad antagonizes the anti-apoptotic function of Bcl-2 and Bcl-Xl by forming inactivating Bad-Bcl-2 and Bad-Bcl-Xl heterodimers (55Zha J. Harada H. Yang E. Jockel J. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1996; 87: 619-628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2241) Google Scholar). Bad has recently been shown to be a target of PKB/Akt-mediated phosphorylation, and the phosphorylation of Bad by PKB/Akt prevents Bad from heterodimerizing with Bcl-2 and Bcl-Xl (55Zha J. Harada H. Yang E. Jockel J. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1996; 87: 619-628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2241) Google Scholar, 56del Peso L. Gonzalez-Garcia M. Page C. Herrera R. Nunez G.

Cell. 1997; 91: 231-241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4915) Google Scholar). When uncomplexed with Bad, Bcl-2 and Bcl-Xl are capable of abrogating Bax-mediated apoptosis through the formation of Bcl-2/Bcl-Xl-Bax heterodimers (42Reed J.C. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 3225-3236Crossref PubMed Scopus (936) Google Scholar, 55Zha J. Harada H. Yang E. Jockel J. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1996; 87: 619-628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2241) Google Scholar). Bax is a transcriptional target of p53 in BRK cell lines transformed by E1A and tsp53(Val-135), and its expression is sufficient to induce apoptosis (40Han J. Sabbatini P. Perez D. Rao L. Modha D. White E. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 461-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). Therefore, by phosphorylating Bad and potentiating the interaction of Bcl-2 and Bcl-Xl with Bax, PKB/Akt could conceivably protect from apoptosis induced by p53. However, Bad expression was completely undetectable in the Akt-1 cell line at both 38.5 and 32 °C (data not shown). Therefore, the delayed onset of p53-mediated apoptosis observed in the Akt-1 line cannot be explained by the PKB/Akt-mediated phosphorylation of Bad. This result is not unexpected, as Bad has a very restricted pattern of tissue expression (58Kitada S. Krajewska M. Zhang X. Scudiero D. Zapata J.M. Wang H.G. Shabaik A. Tudor G. Krajewski S. Myers T.G. Johnson G.S. Sausville E.A. Reed J.C. Am. J. Pathol. 1998; 152: 51-61PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, the IL-4-mediated survival of myeloid cells is paralleled by the activation of PKB/Akt in the absence of Bad phosphorylation (59Scheid M.P. Duronio V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7439-7444Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). Thus, PKB/Akt does not need to phosphorylate Bad to protect from apoptosis induced by either IL-4 deprivation or p53. The possibility that PKB/Akt compromises the onset of p53-dependent apoptosis by phosphorylating Bad-like proteins, however, cannot be discounted at this time.We have demonstrated that PI3K and PKB/Akt can promote cell survival by compromising the kinetics of apoptosis induced by p53. It would therefore be of interest to determine if PI3K-PKB/Akt-mediated survival can restrict the efficacy of anticancer interventions that function by triggering p53-induced apoptosis. Indeed, p53 has been shown to mediate apoptosis in response to γ-radiation and certain chemotherapeutic reagents (60Lowe S.W. Ruley H.E. Jacks T. Housman D.E. Cell. 1993; 74: 957-967Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2951) Google Scholar, 61Clarke A.R. Purdie C.A. Harrison D.J. Morris R.G. Bird C.C. Hooper M.L. Wyllie A.H.

Sachs L. Cell Growth Differ. 1993; 4: 41-47PubMed Google Scholar). This concern may be especially relevant in the treatment of malignancies such as ovarian cancer, in which the PI3K-PKB/Akt survival pathway has been shown to be aberrantly activated (65Cheng J.Q. Godwin A.K. Bellacosa A. Taguchi T. Franke T.F. Hamilton T.C. Tsichlis P.N. Testa J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9267-9271Crossref PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar, 66Shayesteh L.

Sakunaga H. Ma Y.Y. Carcangiu M.L. Pinkel D. Yang-Feng T.L. Gray J.W. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 6172-6180PubMed Google Scholar).The abrogation of p53-mediated apoptosis through inactivating mutations represents an important driving force in tumor development (68Howes K.A. Ransom N. Papermaster D.S. Lasudry J.G. Albert D.M. Windle J.J. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1300-1310Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar, 69Pan H. Griep A.E.

A. 1994; 91: 2026-2030Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). However, the inactivation of p53 is typically not involved in tumor initiation, as it is frequently observed to be a late-onset event in human cancers (71Canman C.E. Kastan M.B. Adv. Pharmacol. 1997; 41: 429-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Thus, there may exist other oncogenic mechanisms that function to modulate the impact of p53-mediated apoptosis at the early stages of cancer development. The transformation of colorectal epithelium to carcinomas is associated with a progressive inhibition of apoptosis, and p53 inactivation occurs near the transition from benign to malignant growth (72Bedi A. Pasricha P.J. Akhtar A.J. Barber J.P. Bedi G.C. Giardiello F.M. Zehnbauer B.A. Hamilton S.R. Jones R.J. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 1811-1816PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, Ras mutations occur most often during the early adenomatous stage of the disease (73Fearon E.R. Vogelstein B. Cell. 1990; 61: 759-767Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9901) Google Scholar). Thus, it is conceivable that Ras-mediated activation of the PI3K-PKB/Akt survival pathway may function to limit the extent of apoptosis induced by p53 during the early premalignant stages of colon cancer. This, in turn, would facilitate the progression of tumor growth until p53-mediated apoptosis is completely abrogated by inactivating mutations. Ras is capable of suppressing p53-mediated apoptosis in BRK cell lines transformed by E1A and tsp53(Val-135), and the PI3K-PKB/Akt survival pathway is one of many signaling pathways activated downstream of Ras (34Lin H.J.

It would be interesting to determine how these other signaling pathways influence PI3K-PKB/Akt-mediated protection from apoptosis induced by p53, as this might help to explain how Ras functions as an oncogene in vivo. The serine/threonine protein kinase PKB/Akt was originally identified as the cellular counterpart of the v-Akt transforming protein present in AKT8, a retrovirus that causes T cell lymphomas in mice (1Staal S.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 5034-5037Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar). v-Akt was generated by a fusion event that juxtaposes the retroviral glycosaminoglycan protein and the entire coding region of PKB/Akt (2Coffer P.J. Jin J. Woodgett J.R. Biochem. J. 1998; 335: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (966) Google Scholar, 3Bellacosa A. Franke T.F. Gonzalez-Portal M.E. Datta K. Taguchi T. Gardner J. Cheng J.Q. Testa J.R. Tsichlis P.N. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 745-754PubMed Google Scholar). The fusion protein, designated glycosaminoglycan-PKB, is constitutively active due to a myristoylation signal present within the amino terminus of the glycosaminoglycan protein that targets PKB/Akt to the plasma membrane. In quiescent or serum-starved cells, PKB/Akt resides within the cytosol in a catalytically inactive state. Upon stimulation of cells with growth factors and cytokines, PKB/Akt is recruited to the plasma membrane and catalytically activated by phosphorylation at threonine 308 and serine 473 (4Alessi D.R.

Six of the mutant alleles encode a His, Arg, or Phe substitution at Leu-215; another mutant allele has an Arg substitution at Leu-217; and the final two mutant alleles have substitutions of His or Phe at Leu-228. Using plasmids that allow tetracycline regulated expression, the L215H, L217R, and L228F mutations were introduced into a hemagglutinin antigen-tagged β-tubulin cDNA and transfected into wild-type Chinese hamster ovary cells. In all three cases, low to moderate expression of the transfected mutant gene conferred paclitaxel resistance. Higher levels of expression caused disruption of microtubule assembly, cell cycle arrest at mitosis, and failure to proliferate. Consistent with reduced microtubule stability, cells expressing mutant hemagglutinin β-tubulin had fewer acetylated microtubules than nonexpressing cells in the same population. These data, together with previous studies showing that the paclitaxel-resistant mutant cell lines have less stable microtubules, indicate that the leucine cluster represents an important structural motif for microtubule assembly.

Early studies with this compound demonstrated that it binds to microtubules in a 1:1 stoichiometry with tubulin heterodimers (1Manfredi J.J. Parness J. Horwitz S.B. J. Cell Biol. 1981; 94: 688-696Crossref Scopus (351) Google Scholar) and inhibits microtubule disassembly. It is also able to induce microtubule assembly both in vitro and in vivo and induces microtubule bundle formation in treated cells (2Schiff P.B. Fant J. Horwitz S.B.

Recent interest in this and related compounds has been fueled by clinical studies demonstrating remarkable activity of paclitaxel against a number of malignant diseases (reviewed in Ref. 4Rowinsky E.K. Donehower R.C. N. Engl. J. Med. 1995; 332: 1004-1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (1937) Google Scholar). Although still in clinical trials, the demonstrated activity of paclitaxel in phase II studies has led to FDA approval for its use in refractory cases of breast and ovarian cancer. As more patients are treated with this drug, clinical resistance is expected to become an increasingly significant problem. The mechanisms by which tumor cells acquire resistance to paclitaxel are not fully understood. Cell culture studies have shown that paclitaxel is a substrate for the multidrug resistance pump (gP170),1 and cells selected for high levels of resistance to the drug have increased gP170 (reviewed in Ref. 5Casazza A.M.

Nevertheless, it has yet to be demonstrated that this mechanism is significant in paclitaxel refractory tumors. Indeed, the remarkable efficacy of paclitaxel in early clinical studies of patients who were pretreated with Adriamycin, a well known substrate for gP170, argues that the multidrug resistance (mdr) phenotype may not be as clinically prevalent as had initially been anticipated (4Rowinsky E.K. Donehower R.C. N. Engl. J. Med. 1995; 332: 1004-1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (1937) Google Scholar). Additional mechanisms of resistance to paclitaxel have been reported. For example, several laboratories have provided evidence that changes in the expression of specific β-tubulin genes are associated with paclitaxel resistance in cultured tumor cell lines (6Haber M.

Acta. 1998; 1395: 237-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). More recently, a report describing mutations in β-tubulin that make the protein unresponsive to paclitaxel has appeared (10Giannakakou P. Sackett D.L. Kang Y.-K. Zhan Z. Buters J.T.M. Fojo T. Poruchynsky M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17118-17125Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar). To date, however, there is little evidence that any of the mechanisms described in cell culture cause paclitaxel resistance in human tumors. Our own studies have described a resistance mechanism mediated by tubulin alterations that affect microtubule assembly (reviewed in Ref.11Cabral F. Barlow S.B. Pharmacol. Ther. 1991; 52: 159-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Based on mutant properties and drug cross-resistance patterns, we proposed that these changes in microtubule assembly could compensate for the presence of the drug (12Cabral F. Brady R.C. Schibler M.J. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1986; 466: 745-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar); and we were later able to directly demonstrate that paclitaxel-resistant Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells have diminished microtubule assembly compared with wild-type controls (13Minotti A.M. Barlow S.B. Cabral F. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3987-3994Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, isolation of paclitaxel-resistant mutants provides an opportunity to study mutations that not only give information about the mechanisms of drug action and resistance, but also give structural information about regions of tubulin that are involved in assembly. We have now sequenced nine mutant β-tubulin alleles and find that the mutations cluster at a site that is likely to be involved in lateral or longitudinal interactions during microtubule assembly. Paclitaxel-resistant CHO mutants used in this study and conditions for their growth in α modification of minimum essential medium (α-MEM, Life Technologies, Inc.) have been described previously (14Cabral F. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 97: 22-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 15Cabral F. Wible L. Brenner S. Brinkley B.R. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 97: 30-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 16Schibler M. Cabral F. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 102: 1522-1531Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Metabolic labeling was for 1 h in methionine-free MEM (ICN Biomedicals Inc., Costa Mesa, CA) containing 30 μCi/ml Tran35S-label (1,000 Ci/mmol; ICN Biomedicals). To analyze mutant alleles, we first sequenced the wild-type CHO β1-tubulin gene 2The nomenclature for β-tubulin isotypes used in this paper is according to Lopata et al. (17Lopata M.A. Cleveland D.W. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 1707-1720Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Thus, β1-tubulin is class I, β2-tubulin is class II, etc. (GenBankTMaccession number AF120325) and then used primers in the intron and 5′- and 3′-untranslated regions to amplify the coding sequences from mutant cell DNA. Sequencing was carried out using 2 distinct approaches. In the first, amplified DNA was directionally cloned into M13mp18 or M13mp19, multiple individual plaques for each mutation were isolated, and the sequencing reactions for each dideoxy nucleotide were loaded in adjacent wells of the sequencing gel as described previously (18Kobayashi K. Jackson M.J. Tick D.B. O'Brien W.E. Beaudet A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11361-11367Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because CHO cells are diploid, mutations were easily identified as changes affecting half of the six to eight plaques that were isolated from each polymerase chain reaction amplification. Polymerase (Pfu, Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) errors, on the other hand, were rare and only affected one of the six to eight plaques. A second method involved direct sequencing of the polymerase chain reaction amplified DNA using an ABI model 310 automated sequencer (Perkin-Elmer Corp.). In this case, mutations were detected as coelution of 2 nucleotides from the capillary column when sequenced in both the forward and reverse directions. 3Examples of both sequencing methods can be found in supplemental Fig. 1 of the on-line version of this paper. Mutations were confirmed by repeating the sequencing on freshly amplified DNA and by digesting the polymerase chain reaction-amplified DNA whenever a restriction enzyme site was gained or lost. CHO Cβ1 cDNA (GenBankTM accession number U08342) (19Boggs B. Cabral F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2700-2707Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 20Boggs B.A. Gonzalez-Garay M.L. Cabral F. DNA Seq. 1996; 6: 171-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar), modified to express a 9-amino acid hemagglutinin antigen (HA) tag at the C terminus of β1-tubulin (21Gonzalez-Garay M.L. Cabral F. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1995; 31: 259-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), was used for all transfections. To obtain regulated expression, pcDNA3 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) was modified to incorporate the features of a tetracycline regulated vector system (22Gossen M. Bujard H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5547-5551Crossref PubMed Scopus (4214) Google Scholar), and the new plasmid was named pTOPneo. A 1.5-kilobase pair Hin dIII/Not I fragment from plasmid BlskHAβ1 (21Gonzalez-Garay M.L. Cabral F. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1995; 31: 259-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) containing the entire HAβ1-tubulin coding sequence was cloned into the unique Hin dIII/Not I sites of pTOPneo to create pTOPneo-HAβ1. This construct was used for all transfections and for site-directed mutagenesis to create mutant HAβ1-tubulins. A second plasmid carrying the coding sequence of the tetracycline-regulated transactivator (tTA) was made by first replacing the neomycin resistance gene of pTOPneo with the puromycin resistance gene from the vector pPUR (CLONTECH), to create pTOPpuro. The sequence for tTA was then added by cloning a 1-kilobase pair Eco RI/Bam HI fragment from the plasmid pUHD 15-1 (22Gossen M. Bujard H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5547-5551Crossref PubMed Scopus (4214) Google Scholar) into pTOPpuro to create pTOPpuro-tTA. Plasmid DNA was isolated using the QIAfilter Plasmid Maxi Kit (Qiagen Inc., Santa Clarita, CA) and transfected into CHO cell line tTApuro 6.6, obtained by transfecting wild-type CHO cells with pTOPpuro-tTA. Transfections were carried out using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) and 1 μg of plasmid DNA according to the manufacturer's instructions except that 1 μg/ml tetracycline (Sigma) was included at each step to inhibit expression of the cDNA until the time of analysis. Stable transfectants were isolated and maintained in medium containing 2 mg/ml G418 (Life Technologies, Inc.) plus 1 μg/ml tetracycline or 0.2 μg/ml paclitaxel with no tetracycline. Preparation of samples for one- and two-dimensional gel analysis has been described previously (23Cabral F. Schatz G. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 56: 602-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar,24Gonzalez-Garay M.L. Cabral F. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1525-1534Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). For Western blot analysis, proteins were electrophoretically transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane (25Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44644) Google Scholar) and probed with a mixture of mouse monoclonal antibodies to β-tubulin (Tub 2.1, 1:2,000 dilution, Sigma) and actin (C4, 1:5,000 dilution, ICN). This was followed by incubation in peroxidase-conjugated goat antimouse IgG (1:2,000 dilution, Cappel Laboratories, Cochranville, PA) and detection by chemiluminescence (Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD) using the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were grown on glass coverslips to approximately 70% of confluence and fixed in methanol (−20 °C) for at least 10 min as described previously (21Gonzalez-Garay M.L. Cabral F. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1995; 31: 259-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The primary antibody used for most experiments was mouse monoclonal 12CA5 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), specific for the HA tag. This was followed by fluorescein-conjugated goat antimouse IgG (Cappel). For double label experiments, mouse monoclonal 6-11B-1 (Sigma), specific for acetylated α-tubulin, was added together with rabbit antibody HA11 (Berkeley Antibody Co., Richmond, CA), specific for the HA tag. This was followed with a mixture of goat affinity purified and cross-absorbed antibodies consisting of Oregon Green-conjugated antirabbit IgG and Rhodamine Red-X-conjugated antimouse IgG (both from Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR). Photographs were taken on TMAX 400 film (Eastman Kodak) using an Optiphot microscope equipped with epifluorescence and a 40X fluor objective (Nikon Inc., Melville, NY). The ability of β-tubulin mutations to confer paclitaxel resistance was evaluated in 2 ways. In the first, stably transfected cell lines expressing mutant HAβ1-tubulin were seeded at approximately 100 cells/well in replicate wells of a 24-well dish containing increasing concentrations of paclitaxel. The assay was carried out in duplicate with only one set containing 1 μg/ml tetracycline. After 6–7 days, the medium was removed, and the resistant colonies were stained with a solution of 0.1% methylene blue as described previously (26Cabral F. Sobel M.E. Gottesman M.M. Cell. 1980; 20: 29-36Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). In a second assay, aliquots (∼7 × 104 cells for selective and ∼100 cells for nonselective conditions) from total transfected cell populations were seeded into duplicate six-well dishes containing normal medium (nonselective), 2 mg/ml G418, or 0.2 μg/ml paclitaxel, each with or without 1 μg/ml tetracycline. After the appearance of visible colonies (6–7 days), one duplicate dish was stained with methylene blue, and colonies were counted. Cells in the second dish were trypsinized and replated onto glass coverslips for immunofluorescence observation. The distribution of tubulin between the soluble and polymerized pools was measured using a previously published procedure (13Minotti A.M. Barlow S.B. Cabral F. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3987-3994Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were incubated for two generations (24 h) in [3H]methionine to label the proteins to steady state, the cells were lysed with a microtubule stabilizing buffer, microtubules were separated from soluble tubulin by centrifugation, a constant amount of [35S]methionine-labeled CHO cell extract was added to each fraction, the proteins in each fraction were separated by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, and the3H/35S ratio for β-tubulin was determined by liquid scintillation counting of spots excised from the gels. This method gives very accurate and reproducible measurements of the fraction of tubulin in the assembled state (13Minotti A.M. Barlow S.B. Cabral F. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3987-3994Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our laboratory has isolated a large number of paclitaxel-resistant CHO cells with diminished microtubule assembly (14Cabral F. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 97: 22-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 16Schibler M. Cabral F. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 102: 1522-1531Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 27Cabral F. Abraham I. Gottesman M.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 4388-4391Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). For the initial seqencing of these mutants, we focused on six cell lines that exhibited alterations in the two-dimensional gel migration of β-tubulin, but we also included seven additional cell lines with no such alterations. Their two-dimensional gel patterns are summarized in Fig. 1. The seven mutants with an unaltered two-dimensional gel pattern resembled wild-type cells in displaying a single spot for all the expressed forms of β-tubulin (Fig. 1 A). The remaining six cell lines with an altered two-dimensional gel pattern fell into two groups. Most displayed an additional β-tubulin spot with a more basic isoelectric point (arrowhead, Fig. 1 B), but strain 11-3 had an additional β-tubulin spot with a more acidic isoelectric point (arrowhead, Fig. 1 C). For the mutants with the gel pattern in Fig. 1 B, the direction and magnitude of the shift from the wild-type position is consistent with a single charge difference as would be expected for the substitution of a basic for a neutral amino acid or a neutral for an acidic amino acid. The direction of the shift in Tax-11-3, on the other hand, suggests the substitution of an acidic for a neutral amino acid or a neutral for a basic amino acid. Prior work has demonstrated that diploid CHO cell β-tubulin is composed of 70% β1, 25% β4b, and 5% β5 (28Sawada T. Cabral F. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 3013-3020Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Ahmad S. Singh B. Gupta R.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1090: 252-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The mutations we have uncovered invariably occur in one of the two alleles of the β1-tubulin gene and therefore affect approximately 1/3 (35%) of the total β- tubulin produced (28Sawada T. Cabral F. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 3013-3020Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The concentration of mutations in a single gene is probably related to the relative abundance of the β1-tubulin in this cell line. Resistant cell lines were selected in one step to a single lethal dose of paclitaxel and are approximately 2–3-fold resistant to the drug. Some cell lines are additionally paclitaxel-dependent (14Cabral F. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 97: 22-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 15Cabral F. Wible L. Brenner S. Brinkley B.R. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 97: 30-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 16Schibler M. Cabral F. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 102: 1522-1531Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). This latter phenotype is easily recognized by a failure of the cells to divide when paclitaxel is omitted from the growth medium and is characterized by a change in morphology to large multinucleated cells (11Cabral F. Barlow S.B. Pharmacol. Ther. 1991; 52: 159-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). 4A comparison of the morphologies of paclitaxel-resistant versus -dependent cell lines can be found in supplemental Fig. 2 of the online version of this paper. These and other properties are consistent with a model in which paclitaxel resistance mutations in tubulin destabilize microtubules (12Cabral F. Brady R.C. Schibler M.J. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1986; 466: 745-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 30Cabral F. Barlow S.B. FASEB J. 1989; 3: 1593-1599Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Direct measurements of the extent of tubulin assembly in mutant cell lines have supported this model (13Minotti A.M. Barlow S.B. Cabral F. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3987-3994Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). TableI summarizes the extent of tubulin assembly in cell lines with β-tubulin mutations. Particularly noteworthy is the observation that paclitaxel dependent mutants have a lower extent of microtubule assembly than wild-type or resistant cell lines, suggesting that paclitaxel-dependent cells are not fundamentally different from resistant cells. Rather, they simply have mutations in tubulin that are more disruptive to microtubule assembly. Thus, paclitaxel resistance mutations produce a spectrum of alterations in microtubule assembly from minimally disruptive (resistant cells) to highly disruptive (dependent cells).Table ISummary of β-tubulin mutations in paclitaxel-resistant CHO cellsCell lineSequence1-aFor the upper series of mutants, codons 215 and 217 are underlined.

We suspect that this cell line may have a second mutation in another gene because of its extremely low reversion frequency (16Schibler M. Cabral F. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 102: 1522-1531Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Open table in a new tab To gain insight into the mutations that destabilize microtubule assembly, β1-tubulin from each of 13 mutant cell lines was sequenced. Four of the seven mutants with a normal two-dimensional gel pattern failed to exhibit an alteration in the β1-tubulin gene. This was an expected result, because we have previously shown that mutations in both α- and β-tubulin confer paclitaxel resistance with equal frequency (16Schibler M. Cabral F. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 102: 1522-1531Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Mutations in the β1-tubulin gene from the remaining three mutants, plus the six mutants with an altered two-dimensional gel pattern, are summarized in Table I. We were surprised to find that six of the nine mutations resulted in an amino acid substitution at Leu-215, and in three of these, leucine was replaced by histidine. It is unlikely that the three mutants with a histidine substitution represent sister clones because the cell lines came from independent selections, and the cells have distinctive morphologies. In addition to the His substitution at amino acid 215, only Phe and Arg substitutions were found. The remaining cell lines had L217R, L228F, and L228H substitutions. This clustering of mutations in a small region of β1-tubulin, all affecting leucine residues, is remarkable and suggests a structural motif that may be critical for microtubule assembly. Two of the cell lines exhibited more than a single base substitution in the β1-tubulin gene. Tax-18 has 2 C to T transitions within the same codon (CTC to TTT). Restriction enzyme digestion experiments indicated that both transitions in Tax-18 occurred in the same β1-tubulin allele. 5M. L. Gonzalez-Garay and F. Cabral, unpublished data. Tax-11-3 has a G38E substitution (GGA to GAA) in addition to the L228F substitution shown in Table I. The G38E substitution in Tax-11-3 explains the acidic shift observed for the mutant β1-tubulin on two-dimensional gels (Fig. 1 C), because the L228F substitution in this mutant is expected to be electrophoretically silent. Transfection experiments (described later) indicate that the G38E mutation does not contribute to paclitaxel resistance, a conclusion that is consistent with the observation that 48 of 48 revertants of this strain retained the G38E mutation as evidenced by retention of the acidic shift in the position of the mutant β1-tubulin on two-dimensional gels (16Schibler M. Cabral F. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 102: 1522-1531Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Although the amino acid substitutions we have uncovered in paclitaxel-resistant mutants predict amino acid changes that are consistent with the mobilities of the altered β1-tubulins on two-dimensional gels (e.g. see Fig. 1), it is possible that other alterations in these cell lines may also contribute to the resistance phenotype. For example, Tax-2-4 (Table I) has a more extreme phenotype than Tax-1-4 or Tax-4-9, even though it has the same L215H mutation. Based on its very low reversion frequency (16Schibler M. Cabral F. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 102: 1522-1531Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), we have long suspected that Tax-2-4 may have a second mutation, but we have not sequenced all of the remaining tubulin genes to confirm this suspicion. To avoid the ambiguities inherent in trying to assign phenotypes to observed biochemical or genetic changes in the mutant cell lines, we adopted the strategy of recreating the mutations in a cloned cDNA and directly demonstrating that transfection of that cDNA is sufficient to confer paclitaxel resistance. To accomplish this, a chimeric CHO β1-tubulin cDNA encoding a 9-amino acid hemagglutinin antigen (HA) epitope tag at the C terminus of the polypeptide (21Gonzalez-Garay M.L. Cabral F. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1995; 31: 259-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), was modified by site-directed mutagenesis to introduce the L215H, L217R, and L228F mutations. We circumvented the possibility that overexpression of these mutant genes might be toxic to transfected cells by inserting the altered tubulin cDNAs into a pTOPneo vector that places the gene to be expressed under the control of a minimum cytomegalovirus promoter whose activity requires the binding of a tetracycline regulated transactivator to an upstream bacterial tetO sequence (22Gossen M. Bujard H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5547-5551Crossref PubMed Scopus (4214) Google Scholar). Each of the mutant cDNAs, as well as an unmodified HAβ1-tubulin, was transfected into a CHO strain (tTA/puro 6.6) that was isolated in this laboratory and produces the tetracycline-regulated transactivator in the absence, but not the presence, of tetracycline. Stable G418-resistant cell lines from each of the transfections were isolated and screened for production of HA-tagged β-tubulin by immunofluorescence. Approximately half of the cell lines for each transfection proved to be positive, and some examples of these are shown in Fig. 2. For each clone, >95% of the cells in the population stained positive for HAβ1-tubulin production. To obtain a more quantitative estimate for the fraction of total β-tubulin represented by the HAβ1-tubulin in each cell line, Western blot analysis with an antibody that recognizes both forms of β-tubulin was carried out (Fig. 3). The HAβ1 transfectant exhibited a very high level of HAβ-tubulin production, resulting in a cell line in which the majority of the endogenous β-tubulin is replaced by the epitope-tagged tubulin at steady state. The HAβ1L217R and HAβ1L228F transfectants also had high production of HAβ-tubulin, but the endogenous β-tubulin remained a significant component. The lowest level of HAβ-tubulin was found in the HAβ1L215H transfectant, where it accounted for only a small fraction of the total β-tubulin in the cell. In all four cases, production of HA-tagged tubulin was undetectable by immunofluorescence or Western blot analysis when the cells were grown in tetracycline.Figure 3Production of wild-type and mutant HA β1-tubulin in transfected cell lines.

The footprint of RNAP II arrested at a CPD, using exonuclease III and T4 DNA polymerase's 3′→5′ exonuclease, covers ∼35 base pairs and is asymmetrically located around the dimer. A similar footprint is observed when RNAP II is arrested at the human histone H3.3 arrest site. Addition of elongation factor SII to RNAP II arrested at a CPD produced shortened transcripts of discrete lengths up to 25 nucleotides shorter than those seen without SII. After addition of photolyase and exposure to visible light, some of the transcripts could be reelongated beyond the dimer, suggesting that SII-mediated transcript cleavage accompanied significant RNAP II backup, thereby providing access of the repair enzyme to the arresting CPD.

Spivak G. Hanawalt P.C. Cell. 1987; 51: 241-249Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1041) Google Scholar). TCR has been shown to occur in mammalian cells (2Mellon I. Bohr V.A. Smith C.A. Hanawalt P.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 8878-8882Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar), in Escherichia coli (3Mellon I. Hanawalt P.C. Nature. 1989; 342: 95-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar), and in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (4Leadon S.A. Lawrence D.A. J. Biol.

Several lines of evidence have suggested that an active RNA polymerase elongation complex is necessary for preferential repair of the transcribed strand (7Tornaletti S. Hanawalt P.C. Biochimie (Paris). 1999; 81: 139-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). A model for TCR has been proposed in which the RNA polymerase stalled at a lesion directs repair enzymes to the transcribed strand of an active gene (2Mellon I. Bohr V.A. Smith C.A. Hanawalt P.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 8878-8882Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). This model assumes that the polymerase must be removed from the site of the lesion to provide access for the repair complex to the lesion site and to allow reannealing of the DNA strands to form a proper substrate for repair. An essential question about the mechanism of TCR is how the repair proteins recognize an RNAP II elongation complex arrested at a lesion and distinguish it from a transcription complex arrested at a natural arrest site. The process of transcriptional arrest can provide some clues to this question. RNAP II arrest sites have been identified and characterized (8Uptain S.M. Kane C.M. Chamberlin M.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 117-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). Arrest can occur at a bend in the helix axis of template DNA (9Kerppola T.K. Kane C.M. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 269-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). It can also be induced by nucleotide depletion (10Rice G.A. Kane C.M. Chamberlin M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 4245-4249Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), DNA-binding drugs (11Mote J.J. Ghanouni P. Reines D. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 236: 725-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), and sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins (12Reines D. Conaway R. Conaway J.W. Transcription. Raven Press Ltd., New York1994: 263-278Google Scholar). RNAP II can bypass arrest sites by activation of a cryptic endonuclease function that resides in the polymerase, a process mediated by the transcription elongation factor SII. SII-mediated transcript cleavage removes short oligonucleotides of discrete lengths from the 3′ end of the nascent RNA. Transcript shortening is thought to restore the association of the 3′ end of the transcript with the catalytic site in the polymerase after arrest. Footprinting analysis of elongation complexes arrested at a natural arrest site located in the first intron of the human H3.3 gene has shown that the footprint covers ∼35 base pairs (bp) and is characterized by a shorter distance of the 3′ end of the transcript to the leading edge than to the rear edge of the polymerase (13Gu W. Powell W. Mote Jr., J. Reines D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25604-25616Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Chamberlin M.J. Harvey Lect. 1995; 88: 1-21Google Scholar, 15Nudler E. Goldfarb A. Kashlev M. Science. 1994; 265: 793-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 16Wang D. Meier T.I. Chan C.L. Feng G. Lee D.N. Landick R.

Chem. 1996; 271: 23495-23505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). After addition of SII the boundaries of the footprint do not change significantly (13Gu W. Powell W. Mote Jr., J. Reines D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25604-25616Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but the 3′ end of the transcript is positioned near the catalytic site of the polymerase so that transcription can continue past the arrest site. We have speculated that a change in RNA polymerase conformation similar to that resulting from natural arrest sites may also occur at the site of a lesion and that this may be the signal required to recruit repair proteins to the damage site. This hypothesis was supported by our observation that complexes arrested at the site of a CPD are substrates for SII-induced transcript shortening and that the shortened transcripts can be reelongated up to the point of blockage (18Donahue B.A. Yin S. Taylor J.-S. Reines D. Hanawalt P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8502-8506Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). Importantly, this observation demonstrates that the transcript is not released from the CPD-arrested complex. To determine the likely conformation of RNAP II arrested at a CPD we have carried out footprinting experiments using enzymatic probes and immunopurified ternary complexes arrested at a specifically located CPD. We have determined the conformation of RNAP II arrested at a CPD before and after SII-mediated transcript cleavage and compared this conformation with RNAP II arrested at the H3.3 arrest site. Furthermore, we show conditions in which SII-mediated transcript cleavage is accompanied by the actual displacement of RNAP II from the CPD site. This was indicated by the ability of Anacystis nidulans photolyase to access and repair the CPD site. After SII-mediated transcript cleavage and photoreversal, some of the transcripts could be reelongated beyond the resulting thymines. RNAP II, transcription initiation factors, and SII were purified from rat liver or recombinant sources as described previously (19Reines D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10510-10517Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Gu W. Reines D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11238-11244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). T4 polynucleotide kinase, T4 DNA ligase, and E. coli exonuclease III were from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Photolyase from A. nidulans was a gift from Dr. Anders Eker (Erasmus University, Rotterdam, The Netherlands). E. coli strain MV1184 was a gift of Dr. Joachim Messing (Rutgers University, Piscataway, NJ). D44 IgG anti-RNA antibodies (21Eilat D. Hochberg M. Fischel R. Laskov R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 3818-3822Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) were purified from ascites fluid as described previously (19Reines D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10510-10517Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Highly purified NTPs were purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, formalin-fixed Staphylococcus aureus was from Calbiochem, and T4 DNA polymerase was from New England Biolabs. Radiolabeled nucleotides were purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Plasmid pAdH1 contains a 42-bp fragment of the human histone H3.3 arrest site. Construction of pAdH1 has been described (22Tornaletti S. Donahue B.A. Reines D. Hanawalt P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31719-31724Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Plasmid pUC118 was from Worthington. Plasmid pUCH2 was produced by replacing a 51-bp Eco RI-Hin dIII fragment of pUC118 with a 470-bp Eco RI-Hin dIII fragment of pAdH1. This resulted in cloning the H3.3 arrest sequence in opposite orientation with respect to pAdH1. pUCH2 was transformed into the F′ E. coli strain MV1184 to produce single-stranded DNA for primer extension (see below). DNA templates used for transcription reactions consisted of plasmid DNA linearized with Hin dIII. DNA templates used in footprinting experiments consisted of Eco RI-Hin dIII fragments labeled at the 5′ end of either the template or the non-template strand (see Figs. 1 and 2). They were obtained by linearizing plasmid DNA with Hin dIII or Eco RI, labeling the 5′ end with [γ-32P]ATP, and digesting with Eco RI and Pvu II or Hin dIII and Pvu II, respectively. This digestion produced a DNA fragment labeled at the 5′ end of the template or the non-template strand, including the promoter and the H3.3 sequence or the CPD, a small end-labeled Eco RI-Pvu II or Hin dIII-Pvu II fragment, and a long unlabeled portion of the plasmid DNA. DNA was purified by phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation before use in footprinting experiments.Figure 2Schematic representation of ExoIII mapping of RNAP II complexes arrested by a CPD in the transcribed strand. Immunopurified complexes arrested at a CPD were assembled on a DNA fragment labeled at the 5′ end of the template strand to map the upstream boundary (A) or the non-template strand to map the downstream boundary (B).

Covalently closed circular DNA containing a single CPD adduct on the transcribed strand was produced by priming 10 μg of the plus strand of pUCH2 with a 5-fold molar excess of CPD-containing oligonucleotide phosphorylated at the 5′ end in a 300-μl reaction mixture containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 600 μm each of dATP, dCTP, dTTP, and dGTP, 1 mm ATP, 30 units of T4 DNA polymerase, and 5 units of T4 DNA ligase. Covalently closed circular molecules were purified from an agarose gel containing 0.3 μg/ml ethidium bromide. Under these conditions, covalently closed circular DNA migrates as supercoiled DNA and can be resolved from single-stranded closed circular and nicked double-stranded plasmids. Treatment of closed circular DNA molecules with T4 endonuclease V indicated that ∼80% contained a CPD (data not shown). DNA templates were incubated for 30 min at 28 °C with rat liver protein fraction D (2 μg, containing TFIID and TFIIH) and rat liver RNAP II (0.5 μg) in a 20-μl mixture containing 20 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.9, 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.9, 2.2 mm polyvinylalcohol, 212 units RNasin, 0.5 mg/ml acetylated bovine serum albumin, 150 mmKCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 3% glycerol. After incubation, 33 μl of a solution containing fraction B′ (1 μg, containing TFIIF and TFIIE) and recombinant rat TFIIB (3 ng) in the same buffer as fraction D but without KCl were added, and incubation continued for 20 min at 28 °C to form preinitiation complexes. 7 mm MgCl2, 20 μm ATP, 20 μm UTP, and 40 μCi of [α-32P]CTP or unlabeled CTP (20 μm) were added, and incubation continued for 20 min. Elongation proceeds to nucleotide 15, at which the first GTP is required for incorporation. Heparin was added to prevent further initiation and then 800 μm of each NTP was added to allow elongation to continue, typically for 15 min. Arrested complexes were immunoprecipitated with D44 anti-RNA antibodies and formalin-fixed S. aureus and then washed three times in reaction buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 3 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.9, 60 mm KCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mg/ml acetylated bovine serum albumin, and 2.2% (w/v) polyvinyl alcohol. Washed complexes were resuspended in 60 μl of reaction buffer for further treatment. For SII-mediated transcript cleavage, arrested complexes were incubated with SII for 1 h at 28 °C in 60 μl of reaction buffer containing 7 mm MgCl2. In experiments with photolyase the reaction buffer was adjusted to contain 5 mm dithiotreitol. Reactions were stopped with SDS and proteinase K, and nucleic acids were precipitated with ethanol. Samples were resuspended in formamide loading dye, heat denatured, and electrophoresed through a 6% polyacrylamide gel in TBE (89 mm Tris, 89 mm boric acid, 1 mmEDTA, pH 8) with 8.3 m urea. Gels were dried and autoradiographed using intensifying screens. Washed complexes arrested at a CPD or at the H3.3 arrest site were incubated with 7 mm MgCl2 and 65 units of E. coli exonuclease III (ExoIII) in reaction buffer at 37 °C for 3 min or with 12 units of T4 DNA polymerase 3′→5′ exonuclease (T4 exo) at 37 °C for 30 min. For the analysis of the upstream boundary, washed elongation complexes were first digested with Fsp I for 15 min at 37 °C in reaction buffer containing 7 mm MgCl2. Reactions were stopped by addition of SDS and proteinase K. Nucleic acids were precipitated with ethanol and dried. To characterize the structural properties of transcription complexes arrested at a CPD we have used an in vitro transcription system with DNA templates in which a thymine-thymine CPD is situated at a specific site downstream of the major late promoter of adenovirus (AdMLP) (Fig. 1), partially purified rat liver RNAP II, and initiation factors to carry out transcription, as described previously (18Donahue B.A. Yin S. Taylor J.-S. Reines D. Hanawalt P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8502-8506Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides containing site-specific CPDs were inserted at a long distance (>150 bp) downstream of the major late promoter of adenovirus to make sure that RNA polymerase elongation complexes had completed any transitions out of the initiating state before encountering the CPD (23Samkurashvili I. Luse D.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 9: 5343-5354Crossref Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Transcription proceeds until RNAP II reaches a site-specific CPD in the transcribed strand of the DNA template (18Donahue B.A. Yin S. Taylor J.-S. Reines D. Hanawalt P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8502-8506Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). Transcription complexes arrested at a CPD were immunoprecipitated with D44 anti-RNA antibodies to remove most of the DNA template that does not participate in the transcription reaction. This step is essential to obtain a homogeneous population of ternary complexes arrested at lesions. To map the boundaries of arrested complexes we used ExoIII and T4 exo as footprinting agents. ExoIII is a processive 3′→5′, double strand-dependent nuclease used commonly to detect the boundaries of RNA polymerase on DNA (13Gu W. Powell W. Mote Jr., J. Reines D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25604-25616Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Samkurashvili I. Luse D.S. J. Biol.

Tightly bound proteins block the nuclease, resulting in a resistant core that delineates the protein's boundary (Fig.2). This footprinting method has the advantage of a rather sharp transition from the protected to the unprotected area on the DNA with the borders more clearly defined than in footprints obtained with other probes. Furthermore, the digestion with ExoIII in contrast to DNase I is sequence-independent. Also, we can compare our data with previous ExoIII analyses of RNA polymerase II-arrested and -halted complexes (13Gu W. Powell W. Mote Jr., J. Reines D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25604-25616Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Wang D. Meier T.I. Chan C.L. Feng G. Lee D.N. Landick R. Cell. 1995; 81: 341-350Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 17Samkurashvili I. Luse D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23495-23505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). T4 exo was used as an alternative footprinting probe to confirm the results obtained with Exo III. To map the upstream boundary, RNAP II complexes arrested at a CPD or at the H3.3 arrest site were assembled on linear templates labeled with32P at the 5′ end of the template strand (Figs. 1 and 2). The extent of RNA synthesis was verified by labeling transcripts with [α-32P]CTP. Transcription of templates containing the H3.3 sequence produced transcripts arrested at the H3.3 site and full-length runoff transcripts resulting from read-through of this sequence (Fig. 3, lane 1). Transcription of templates containing a site-specific CPD in the transcribed strand produced mostly shortened transcripts arrested at the CPD and a small portion of full-length runoff transcripts, resulting from transcription of undamaged templates present in the preparation (Fig. 3, lane 6). Arrested complexes were immunopurified with anti-RNA antibodies. Identical complexes containing unlabeled transcripts were prepared for ExoIII or T4 exo mapping. Before ExoIII or T4 exo treatment, we separated the promoter region from the labeled fragment in arrested complexes by digesting with restriction enzyme Fsp I (Fig. 2 A). This step was required to remove blockage of ExoIII or T4 exo in the AdMLP promoter by factors bound to the TATA box binding region (13Gu W. Powell W. Mote Jr., J. Reines D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25604-25616Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that prevented identification of the upstream boundary (Fig. 2 A). ExoIII digestion of complexes arrested at the H3.3 arrest site from this new Fsp I-generated end revealed one prominent product (Fig. 3, lane 3) that mapped 25 bp upstream from the position of the transcript 3′ end. A similar result was obtained with T4 exo (Fig. 3, lane 5). Complexes arrested at a CPD produced a fragment that mapped 22 bp from the T^T dimer (Fig. 3, lane 8; see Fig. 6, lane 4) and a shorter product also present when untranscribed DNA was digested (Fig. 3, lane 7). This product resulted from the blockage of digestion by ExoIII or T4 exo molecules when they encountered the dimer.Figure 6Mapping of the upstream boundaries of RNAP II complexes arrested at a CPD after SII-mediated transcript cleavage. Complexes arrested at a CPD containing32P-labeled (lanes 1–3) or unlabeled (lanes 4–9) RNA were assembled on a DNA fragment labeled at the 5′ end of the template strand. After incubation with or without elongation factor SII (1 ng) and MgCl2 for 1 h at 28 °C, arrested complexes were digested with ExoIII (lanes 4–6) or T4 exo (lanes 7–9).

ExoIII digestion of complexes arrested at the H3.3 arrest site produced three fragments (Fig. 4, lane 3), positioning the front edge of the polymerase 2–12 nt downstream from the 3′ end of the transcript. Mapping with T4 exo (Fig. 4, lane 5) positioned the front edge 2–8 nt from the 3′ end of the transcript. Complexes arrested by a T^T dimer produced a major product with ExoIII (Fig. 4, lane 8; see Fig. 7, lane 4) and a broader set of bands with T4 exo (Fig. 4, lane 10, see Fig. 7, lane 7) corresponding to a downstream boundary located 10–15 nt from the CPD. These results indicated that RNAP II arrested at a CPD covers about 35 bp. Furthermore, the 3′ end of the transcript is closer to the front edge than to the rear edge of the polymerase, similar to complexes arrested at the H3.3 site.Figure 7Mapping of the downstream boundaries of elongation complexes arrested at a CPD after SII-mediated transcript cleavage.

Taylor J.-S. Reines D. Hanawalt P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8502-8506Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). Here we have compared the SII cleavage products of transcripts arrested at the H3.3 arrest site with products resulting from cleavage of transcripts arrested at a CPD. Cleavage of transcripts arrested at the H3.3 sequence produced RNAs of discrete length, shortened from 5 to 20 nt, with identifiable intermediates found in steps of 5 nt (Fig.5, lanes 2–4). Surprisingly, SII-mediated cleavage of transcripts arrested at a CPD produced mostly transcripts that were only about 5 nt shorter (Fig. 5, lane 6). The upstream boundary of these complexes moved 2–3 nt upstream from the position occupied before cleavage (Fig.6). The downstream boundary remained unchanged (Fig. 7). However, a 5-fold increase in SII concentration produced a few transcripts shortened as much as 25 nt (Fig. 5, lane 8). If these shortened transcripts corresponded to RNAP II molecules backed up from the lesion, then photolyase might be able to access the CPD and reverse it, allowing transcription to proceed past the resulting thymines. Complexes arrested at the CPD were treated with A. nidulans photolyase and light after transcript cleavage with SII, and then NTPs were added to allow transcription to proceed on any repaired templates. To distinguish between the full-length transcripts normally observed in these reactions (Fig. 3, lane 6) and RNAs deriving from read-through after photoreactivation, template DNA was shortened by digestion with restriction enzyme Hha I prior to NTP addition. As expected, most transcripts were reelongated only up to the dimer site (Fig. 8, lane 7), but some were elongated to the Hha I site. To verify that the photolyase was active under the conditions of the transcription assay, elongation complexes were arrested at position 14 on the template by omission of GTP, treated with photolyase to repair the CPD, and finally incubated with NTPs to allow elongation to resume. All the transcripts observed under these conditions were full-length, indicating that the photolyase was active (data not shown).Figure 8RNAP II elongation past a dimer site after SII-mediated transcript cleavage and photoreactivation. Lanes 1–3, complexes arrested at a CPD were incubated without (lane 1) or with (lanes 2 and 3) elongation factor SII (5 ng) and NTPs as indicated; lanes 4 and 5, complexes arrested at a CPD were treated with photolyase (PRE) and NTPs as indicated; lanes 6 and 7, complexes arrested at a CPD were treated with SII for 1 h before photolyase and NTP treatment as indicated.RO, runoff transcript; T^T, transcript arrested at a CPD;read-through, product resulting from transcription of repaired template.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Using ExoIII and T4 exo as footprinting agents and immunopurified RNAP II complexes arrested by a specifically located CPD in the transcribed strand as substrates, we have shown that the footprint of RNAP II arrested by a CPD in the transcribed strand covers ∼35 bp, in agreement with Whitson 2H. Whitson, unpublished observations. and with Selby et al. (26Selby C.P. Drapkin R. Reinberg D. Sancar A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 787-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) using T4 exo and λ exonuclease. However, we have found that the footprint is asymmetric around the dimer rather than symmetrical. This conformation is similar to that of complexes arrested at the natural arrest site contained in the human histone H3.3 gene (Refs. 13Gu W. Powell W. Mote Jr., J. Reines D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25604-25616Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Samkurashvili I. Luse D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23495-23505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, and this study). Furthermore, addition of elongation factor SII produced a population of shortened transcripts of discrete lengths up to 25 nt shorter than the transcripts arrested at a CPD. After photoreversal, a fraction of shortened transcripts could be reelongated past the dimer site, suggesting that SII-mediated transcript cleavage resulted in RNAP II backup, thereby providing access of photolyase to the arresting CPD. The similarity between the footprint at the H3.3 site and at a CPD suggests that arrest at a CPD may occur with a similar mechanism. Recent models of transcription arrest postulate that arrest occurs at certain template locations at which RNAP II fails to continue translocation, resulting in a configuration characterized by a decreased distance between the 3′ end of the transcript and the leading edge of the polymerase and misalignment of the transcript 3′ end from the catalytic site (8Uptain S.M. Kane C.M. Chamberlin M.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 117-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). Similarly, complexes arrested at a CPD are characterized by a shorter distance between the position of the CPD and the leading edge of the polymerase. A stable RNA·DNA hybrid in the elongation complex is necessary to maintain the RNA 3′ terminus engaged with the active site of RNA polymerase (25Nudler E. Mustaev A. Lukhtanov E. Goldfarb A. Cell. 1997; 89: 33-41Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Landick R. Cell. 1997; 88: 741-744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 28Sidorenkov I. Komissarova N. Kashlev M. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 55-64Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). This is consistent with arrest occurring at T-rich sequences in the non-transcribed strand where the dA·dT hybrid at the leading edge of the transcription bubble is energetically favored over the dA·rU hybrid (29Yager T.D. von Hippel P.H. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 1097-1118Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Furthermore, this process involves kinetic competition between incorporation of the next nucleotide and decay into the inactive state (30von Hippel P.H. Science. 1998; 281: 660-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Formation of a CPD causes a small deformation of the double helix consisting of unwinding by ∼15° (31Ciarrocchi G. Pedrini A.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 155: 177-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) and bending of at least 7° relative to the B form (32Wang C.-I. Taylor J.-S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9072-9076Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The neighboring pyrimidines must rotate from their usual B form DNA alignment with overlapping of the 5,6 bonds. This small deformation decreases duplex stability and Watson-Crick hydrogen bonding interaction (33Jing Y. Kao J.F. Taylor J.-S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 3845-3853Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). It is likely that the presence of a CPD in the transcribed strand affects formation of the RNA·DNA hybrid, and this in turn may shift the equilibrium from nucleotide addition toward arrest. Conversely, a CPD in the non-transcribed strand may facilitate read-through of the H3.3 site by shifting the equilibrium toward the RNA·DNA hybrid rather than the DNA·DNA hybrid (22Tornaletti S. Donahue B.A. Reines D. Hanawalt P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31719-31724Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The lower stability of CPD-containing duplexes has also been proposed to facilitate binding of T4 DNA endonuclease V to a thymine dimer-containing duplex by destacking the base pair flanking the 5′ side of the dimer and “flipping out” the base opposite the 5′ T of the dimer (34Vassylyev D.G. Kashiwagi T. Mikami Y. Ariyoshi M. Iwai S. Ohtsuka E. Morikawa K. Cell. 1995; 83: 773-782Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). RNAP II complexes arrested at the H3.3 site can resume elongation after removal of a short transcript from the 3′ end of the nascent RNA by an endonucleolytic activity that resides in the polymerase and is activated by the transcription factor SII (35Reines D. Mote J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1917-1921Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). After SII-activated transcript cleavage, the polymerase boundaries do not change significantly. However, the transcript 3′ end is repositioned near the catalytic site, and elongation can resume from this new 3′ end (13Gu W. Powell W. Mote Jr., J. Reines D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25604-25616Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A similar conformation is observed after transcript cleavage of RNAP II complexes arrested at a CPD (Figs. 6 and 7). However, unlike the case of RNAP II molecules arrested at the H3.3 site, this conformation allows elongation to proceed up to, but not past, the lesion site (18Donahue B.A. Yin S. Taylor J.-S. Reines D. Hanawalt P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8502-8506Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). This may be explained by the observation that a CPD in the transcribed strand is a complete block to transcription elongation, whereas the H3.3 site causes arrest of only a portion of RNAP II molecules. SII-mediated transcript cleavage of complexes arrested at the H3.3 site is supposed to increase the number of chances a polymerase molecule has to read through the block. If SII-mediated transcript cleavage were to be of importance in the TCR mechanism, the RNAP II backup would have to be sufficient to permit access of repair enzymes to the lesion. Previously, we have shown that after SII-mediated transcript cleavage RNAP II arrested at a CPD prevented access of photolyase to the lesion site (18Donahue B.A. Yin S. Taylor J.-S. Reines D. Hanawalt P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8502-8506Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). In the present study we have found conditions in which higher concentrations of SII were used that resulted in transcripts shortened as much as 25 nt. Under these conditions we have observed read-through after photoreversal of the CPD. This suggests that these transcription complexes had been displaced from the lesion site a distance sufficient to allow access of photolyase to the CPD. Furthermore, it is consistent with our previous finding that a polymerase arrested at a CPD shields the dimer from photoreactivation (18Donahue B.A. Yin S. Taylor J.-S. Reines D. Hanawalt P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8502-8506Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). These results support the original TCR model in which RNAP II must be removed from the site of the lesion to provide access for repair enzymes to the lesion site (2Mellon I. Bohr V.A. Smith C.A. Hanawalt P.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 8878-8882Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). They do not exclude the possibility that a fraction of RNAP II molecules covering the lesion may be released from DNA, as suggested by recent evidence indicating that UV irradiation induces ubiquitination of RNAP II followed by proteasomal degradation (36Ratner J.N. Balasubramanian B. Corden J. Warren S.L. Bregman D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5184-5189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). It is likely that multiple biochemical scenarios may ensue when RNAP II is arrested at a lesion. Depending upon the nature of the lesion and its sequence context, the polymerase might either reverse translocate or be released from the DNA to permit access of repair enzymes. We thank Ann K. Ganesan and C. Allen Smith for helpful discussion and critical reading of this manuscript. We thank A. Eker for a generous gift of A. nidulans photolyase and for helpful advice on the photolyase experiment. We are indebted to Joyce Hunt and John Mote, Jr. for expert technical assistance.

The action of these potent growth mediators is known to be regulated by adsorption to heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) on the surface and within the extracellular matrix of other neighboring cells, which respectively promote or restrict interactions with their signal-transducing receptors on target cells. Here we report on the nature of HSPGs inducibly expressed on the surface of macrophages that confer these cells with the capacity to regulate endogenous growth factor activity. We reveal that activated human macrophages express only a single major 48-kDa cell surface HSPG, syndecan-2 (fibroglycan) as the result of de novo RNA and protein synthesis. In addition, we demonstrate this macrophage HSPG selectively binds the macrophage-derived growth factors FGF-2, vascular endothelial growth factor and heparin binding EGF and can present FGF-2 in a form that transactivates receptor-bearing BaF32 cells. These results define a novel and unique proteoglycan profile for macrophages and imply a key role for syndecan-2 in the delivery of sequestered growth factors by inflammatory macrophages for productive binding to their appropriate target cells in vivo.

Kluwer Academic Publishers, Norwell, MA1992: 404-409Crossref Google Scholar). During the recruitment process, blood-derived monocytes undergo progressive differentiation to tissue macrophages characterized by changes in cell surface antigen expression, increased phagocytic activity, and most notably acquisition of the capacity to synthesize an array of different cytokines and growth factors (2Werb Z. Underwood J.L. Rappolee D.A. Van Furth R. Mononuclear Phagocytes. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Norwell, MA1992: 404-409Crossref Google Scholar). Some of the most potent of these molecules are heparin-binding growth factors such as fibroblast growth factor (FGF),1 vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and heparin-binding epidermal growth factor (hbEGF), which promote mesenchymal tissue growth and angiogenesis by triggering the proliferation of fibroblasts, vascular endothelium, neural, and smooth muscle cells (3Burgess W.H.

In addition, the vascular smooth muscle mitogen hbEGF has been directly visualized in macrophages associated with human atherosclerotic plaques (9Rappolee D.A. Mark D. Banda M.J. Werb Z. Science. 1988; 241: 708-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (914) Google Scholar). The biological activity of macrophage-derived growth factors is known to be regulated by interactions with heparan sulfate (HS) chains attached to proteoglycans (HSPGs) present on the surface of neighboring cells and within the surrounding extracellular matrix. In the case of FGF-2, these interactions involve regularly spaced high affinity (Kd 10−7-10−9m) binding sites located in discrete domains of the GAG chain where the basic (GlcAβ1–4 GlcNAc)n disaccharide repeat units are modified by tissue-specific epimerases and sulfotransferases to IdoA(2-OSO3) α 1,4GlcNSO3 (11Turnbull J.E.

Chem. 1994; 269: 18881-18890Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Sequestration by HSPGs on the surface of cells and within the extracellular matrix is thought to limit diffusion of growth factors within the tissues and prevent their rapid degradation by proteolytic enzymes (14Saksela O. Moscatelli D. Sommer A. Rifkin D.B. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 743-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar). More importantly, cell surface HSPGs have been shown to be essential for productive binding of FGFs to their conventional high affinity receptors, the FGFRs, a family of at least eight alternatively spliced transmembrane polypeptides whose cytoplasmic tails encode a tyrosine kinase activity (15Yayon A. Klagsbrun M. Esko J.D. Leder P. Ornitz D.M. Cell. 1991; 64: 841-848Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2094) Google Scholar, 16Ornitz D.M. Yayon A. Flanagan J.G. Svahn C.M. Levi E. Leder P. Mol.

Similar dependence on heparan sulfate has also been reported for the productive binding of hbEGF (18Higashiyama S. Abraham J.A. Klagsbrun M. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 933-940Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar, 19Thompson S.A. Higashiyama S. Wood K. Pollitt N.S. Damm D. McEnroe G. Garrick B. Ashton N. Lau K. Hancock N. Klagsbrun M.

Chem. 1992; 267: 6093-6098Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to their respective tyrosine kinase-linked receptors, consistent with a general role for HSPGs as components of a dual receptor system for heparin-binding growth factors. The levels of cell surface HS appear to be controlled by the regulation of HSPG core protein synthesis. To date, five major cell surface HSPG core polypeptides have been cloned and characterized including the syndecans, betaglycans (type III TGFβ receptors) glypicans (for review, see Ref. 21David D. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 1023-1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar) and discrete isoforms of the hyaluronan receptor CD44 (22Jackson D.G. Bell J.I. Dickinson R. Timans J. Shields J. Whittle N. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 673-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 23Bennett K. Jackson D.G. Simon J.C. Tanczos E. Peach R. Modrell B. Stamenkovic I. Plowman G. Aruffo A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 687-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). Among the most abundant HSPGs, the syndecans comprise a family of four single chain transmembrane polypeptides (24Bernfield M. Kokenyesi R. Kato M. Hinkes M.T. Spring J. Gallo R.L. Lose E.J. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1992; 8: 365-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (970) Google Scholar, 25Carey D.J. Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar), each with a distinct but partly overlapping pattern of tissue expression. For example, syndecan-1 is expressed primarily on epithelial and mesenchymal cells, syndecan-2 (fibroglycan) on endothelial cells and fibroblasts, syndecan-3 (N-syndecan) on neural cells and syndecan-4 (amphiglycan or ryudocan) on each of these cell types. The primary role of the syndecans is thought to be the anchorage of cells to the extracellular matrix (25Carey D.J. Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar), and in the case of syndecan-4, participation in the transduction of extracellular matrix-dependent signaling events (26Oh E.S. Woods A. Couchman J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8133-8136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). However each of the syndecans also bind growth factors including FGF-2 via their HS chains (for review, see Ref. 25Carey D.J. Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar), and syndecan-3 on neural cells has been shown (27Raulo E. Chernousov M.A. Carey D.J. Nolo R. Rauvala H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12999-13004Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to bind the growth factor pleiotrophin (heparin-binding growth associated molecule). Such properties have led to the suggestion that the syndecans may be key regulators of heparin-binding growth factor action in vivo. In our laboratory, we have explored the possibility that macrophages use HSPGs to regulate the biological activity of their many endogenously synthesized growth factors and chemokines. By comparison with other cell types, little is known about the nature of macrophage HSPGs (28Kolset S.O. Gallagher J.T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1032: 191-211PubMed Google Scholar, 29Oravecz T. Pall M. Wang J. Roderiquez G. Ditto M. Norcross M.A. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 4587-4592PubMed Google Scholar), although the synthesis of HS and its roles in regulating lipid uptake and atherogenesis have been well documented in these cells (30Laskin J.D. Dokidis A. Gardner C.R. Laskin D.L. Hepatology. 1991; 14: 306-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 31Edwards I.J. Xu H. Obunike J.C. Goldberg I.J. Wagner W.D. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc.

In this study, we reveal that primary human monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) inducibly express a single major core protein, syndecan-2 (fibroglycan), previously thought to be restricted to fibroblasts and endothelial cells. The functional significance of this observation is underlined by the findings that 1) macrophages expressing syndecan-2 bind FGF-2, VEGF, and hbEGF; and 2) macrophages with bound FGF-2 can promote proliferation of neighboring FGFR-transfected cells. Our results implicate syndecan-2 as the primary macrophage HSPG involved in regulating macrophage-derived growth factor action.

The additional heparin-binding growth factors FGF-1140,VEGF165, hbEGF148, the C-C chemokines MIP-1β and MCP–1 (all carrier-free), and the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1α, IL–1β, and TNFα were purchased from R&D Systems Europe, Abingdon, UK. Bacterial lipopolysaccharide was obtained from Sigma. Monoclonal antibodies specific for the HSPG core polypeptide of human syndecan-1 (B-B4, Serotec, Kidlington, UK), syndecan-2 (10H4, 6G12), syndecan-4 (8G5), glypican-1 (S1), and the monoclonal antibody 3G10, which recognizes unsaturated Δ45–glucuronosyl residues in heparinase III-treated HS, have been described previously (35Lories V. Cassiman J.J. Van den Berghe H. David G. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 7009-7016Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Antibodies to the glycosaminoglycans chondroitin 6-sulfate (MC21C, IgM) and heparan sulfate (10E4, IgM) were obtained from Seikagaku Corp. (Japan). The monoclonal antibody MAB120 specific for human FGF-2 was obtained from Chemicon International Inc. (USA). Fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated Fab′ fragment of goat anti-mouse IgG Fc and IgM and the isotype-matched control antibodies MOPC-31c (IgG1 Kappa), UPC-10 (IgG2a Kappa) and TEPC-183 (IgM Kappa) were obtained from Sigma. The human B cell line Namalwa was stably transfected with full-length human syndecan-2 cDNA in the expression vector pcDNA3 by electroporation (750 V/cm, 960 microFarads) followed by selection in RPMI 1640 10% serum containing G418 (1.25 mg/ml). Human IL-3-dependent BaF3 lymphoid cells transfected with the human flg FGF receptor (FGFR1, 2 Ig domain form), termed BaF32 cells were kindly donated by Prof. John Gallagher, Christie Hospital, Manchester, UK and cultured in RPMI 1640, 10% fetal calf serum, 10% WEHI cell conditioned medium. Samples of synovial fluid were obtained with permission from patients with inflammatory arthritis attending the Nuffield Orthopaedic Center, Oxford, UK. Primary human T cells, monocytes, and MDMs were prepared using either peripheral blood or synovial fluid mononuclear cells as the starting material. To prepare mononuclear cells, freshly drawn (heparinized) whole blood or synovial fluid was diluted 1:1 with RPMI 1640 tissue culture medium and layered on Lymphoprep density gradient medium (Nycomed, Norway). Gradients (50 ml total volume) were centrifuged (1,200 × g, 30 min), and the mononuclear cell band was removed by aspiration. Recovered cells were then washed (3 times) in RPMI 1640, 10% (v/v) autologous human serum by resuspension/recentrifugation. For the isolation of monocytes, the mononuclear cell suspensions were incubated (1 h, 37 °C) in plastic tissue culture dishes (5–15 cm in diameter, 0.5–1 × 106 cells/cm2) in RPMI 1640, 10% (v/v) autologous human serum, to allow selective adherence of monocytes, followed by three successive rinses with warmed medium to remove contaminating nonadherent lymphocytes. The adherent monocytes were then either detached (1 h, 5 °C) in PBS, 5 mm EDTA, pH 7.5 and analyzed immediately (referred to as fresh monocytes) or cultured (37 °C, 5% CO2) in RPMI 1640, 10% autologous serum either alone or supplemented with TNFα (100 ng/ml), IL-1α (1 ng/ml), or LPS (0.5 μg/ml) for 2–5 days (referred to as monocyte-derived macrophages or MDM). These preparations were at least 80% monocytes as assessed by immunofluorescent staining with antibodies to the CD14 antigen. For the isolation of T cells, the mononuclear cell suspensions were treated with goat anti-human IgG antibodies and passed over glass bead columns (CellectTM T cell enrichment immunocolumns, Biotex Laboratories, Canada) to selectively adsorb B cells and monocytes, respectively. The resulting purified T cells were washed, resuspended (2 × 106/ml) in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, and induced to proliferate by culture (24–120 h) with the mitogenic lectin phytohemagglutinin (5 μg/ml, Wellcome, UK). Proliferative responses were confirmed by measuring the incorporation of [3H]thymidine into genomic DNA. For selective cleavage of cell surface heparan sulfate, adherent monocytes or monocyte-derived macrophages in RPMI 1640, 10% human serum were supplemented with heparinase I (EC 4.2.2.7, 5–20 milliunits/ml, Oxford GlycoSciences, UK) and heparinase III (EC 4.2.2.8, 5–10 milliunits/ml, Seikagaku Corp.) and incubated for 2 h at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator before detachment with EDTA as described above. For protease treatment, cells were incubated with trypsin, chymotrypsin, papain, or pepsin (Calbiochem) (each at 100 μg/ml) for 30 min at 37 °C before the addition of the protease inhibitors antipain (60 μg/ml), bestatin (10 μg/ml), chymostatin (20 μg/ml), leupeptin (10 μg/ml), pepstatin (10 μg/ml), E-64 (60 μg/ml), phosphoramidon (60 μg/ml), Pefabloc® SC (400 μg/ml), aprotinin (10 μg/ml), EDTA (1 mm), and detachment with EDTA. For inhibition of heparan sulfate metabolism, monocytes or MDM were supplemented with 30 mm sodium chlorate for 24 h before detachment. For immunofluorescent antibody staining, cells (5 × 105) were incubated (30 min, 5 °C) with saturating concentrations (>10 μg/ml Ig) of the appropriate mouse mAbs or isotype matched control mAbs in PBS, pH 7.5, supplemented with 5% normal human serum, 0.1% sodium azide followed by washing and reincubation (20 min, 5 °C) with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated Fab′ fragment of goat anti-mouse IgG Fc or IgM secondary antibody as appropriate. Cells were then fixed in PBS containing 2% (v/v) formaldehyde before microscopy with a Zeiss Axioskop fluorescence microscope or flow cytometry on a Becton Dickinson FACScan. For immunoperoxidase staining, cells were pelleted onto glass microscope slides by cytospin centrifugation (500 rpm, 5 min), dried overnight, fixed in 100% acetone, incubated with primary antibody as described above, washed, incubated (1 h room temperature) with peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (DAKO EnVision kit, DAKO, UK), washed again, and developed with diaminobenzidine. For Western blotting, samples of heparinase III-treated monocytes or MDM were electrophoresed on 12.5% polyacrylamide SDS-PAGE gels and transferred to nitrocellulose (Amersham Hybond-C Super) before blocking overnight (5% w/v dried milk powder, 0.2% Tween 20 in PBS, pH 7.5) and staining with mAbs (5 μg/ml, 1 h, 25 °C) to human syndecan-2 (10H4) or with the heparan sulfate-specific mAb 3G10. Bands were detected by autoradiography after incubation of the blots with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse IgG (1/1,500 dilution, 1 h, 25 °C) and luminol (Amersham ECL chemiluminescence detection kit). Reverse transcriptase PCR was carried out as described previously. Briefly, total cellular RNA was purified by extraction of cells with guanidinium thiocyanate/acid phenol extraction/ethanol precipitation (36Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63232) Google Scholar) and used as the template for oligo-dT primed first strand cDNA synthetic reactions (3 h, 42 °C) containing 5 μg of total RNA, 0.5 μm dNTPs, 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.3 and 2.5 milliunits of avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase. Samples (2 μl) of the final products were then committed to 50-μl PCR reactions (94 °C, 1 min; 55 °C, 1 min; 72 °C, 1 min; 20–30 cycles) containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 50 mm KCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dNTPs, 1unit of Taq DNA polymerase and the primers Syn 2 F (5′-ATCCGGAAGCTTATGCGGCGCGCGTGGATC-3′) and Syn 2 R Bgl (5′-ATCC GGGGATCCCCTTCTGTCCGTTTAAACAGACT-3′) in a Perkin Elmer Cetus DNA thermal cycler. The PCR products were transferred to HYBOND N+ (Amersham, UK) and hybridized (52 °C) with the32P end-labeled internal probe (5′-CAGAACAAGATACCTGCTCAGACA-3′) in 6× SSC, supplemented with 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.2% SDS, and 5× Denhardt's solution, before washing (1× SSC, 0.5% SDS) at 57 °C (5 min). Parallel reactions were carried out using the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase primers G3PDHF (5′-TGGTCGTATTGGGCGCCTGG-3′) and G3PDHR (5′-CCAAATTCGTTGTCATACCAGG-3′) as a control for quantitation and for cDNA integrity. Purified recombinant FGF-2, VEGF, or hbEGF (5–20 μg) was radiolabeled to high specific activity (1 × 108 cpm/μg) with 1 mCi 125I by chloramine-T oxidation (1 min, 25 °C). Reactions were quenched by the addition of free tyrosine (1 mg/ml) and free radiolabel removed by centrifugation (2,500 rpm, 5 min) through 5-ml columns of Sephadex G-25 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Retention of heparin-binding capacity was confirmed for each batch of iodinated protein by incubation (1 h, 25 °C) with heparin-Sepharose beads (Sigma) in binding buffer (see below). For binding assays, monocytes and MDM were dispensed into 96-well microtiter dishes and incubated (4 h, 5 °C) with different concentrations of radioiodinated FGF-2 either alone (total binding) or in the presence of a 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled growth factor (nonspecific binding) or 10 μg/ml free heparin (non-HSPG mediated binding) in 50 μl of binding buffer (RPMI 1640, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.1% sodium azide), followed by four washes to remove unbound growth factor. The levels of free and bound radioligand in each case were determined by counting samples of the cell pellet and the combined washes, respectively. The equilibrium binding constant Kd was estimated from Scatchard plots (B versus B/F) where B represents specifically bound ligand (total bound minus nonspecifically bound) and F represents free radioligand. The capacity of syndecan-2 present in MDM to bind exogenously added FGF-2 was determined by an ELISA assay in which detergent-lysed extracts of MDM were added to FGF-coated microtiter plates and the immobilized HSPG detected with the syndecan-2 mAb 10H4. To perform the assay, 96-well ELISA plates were coated (overnight at room temperature) with recombinant human FGF-2 (20 μg/ml) in 50 mm Na2CO3/NaHCO3buffer, pH 9.6 (100 μl/well), washed (×2, PBS, pH 7.5) and blocked with PBS, pH 7.5, containing 5% (w/v) dried milk powder and 0.2% (w/v) Tween 20 (blocking buffer). Samples of cytokine-treated MDM (107 cells) or syndecan-2 transfected Namalwa cells were then lysed in 1 ml of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% (w/v) Triton X-100 supplemented with protease inhibitors (see above) for 30 min on ice and insoluble debris removed by centrifugation (12,000 × g, 5 min). Aliquots (100 μl) of the detergent extracts were next added (in triplicate) to the ELISA plates, incubated 1 h at room temperature, washed (×3 in blocking buffer) and reincubated for the same period with 100 μl of 10H4 syndecan-2 mAb or control isotype-matched antibody (2 μg/ml). Plates were then washed, incubated (1 h, room temperature) with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse IgG (1/4,000 dilution in PBS, pH 7.5, containing 5% (w/v) dried milk powder and 0.2% (w/v) Tween 20), washed again, and developed with o- phenylenediamine (0.4 mg/ml) in 25 mm citrate, 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 5.5. Following the addition of H2SO4 (1 m final concentration) plates were read at 495 nm in a Bio-Rad ELISA plate reader. A proprietary FGF-2 ELISA assay system (Quantikine, R&D Systems Europe, Abingdon, UK) was used to measure cellular FGF-2 production from monocytes and MDM. Briefly, samples (200 μl) of cell lysates (106/ml PBS, pH 7.5, 0.1% Triton X-100) or of growth medium from monocytes cultured in RPMI 1640, 10% autologous human serum in 6-well tissue culture plates (Nunc, UK) were applied in duplicate to the anti-FGF antibody coated microtiter plates followed by incubation (2 h, room temperature), washing, and detection with a second horseradish peroxidase-conjugated FGF-2 antibody. Plates were then developed exactly as described above and read at 495 nm in a Bio-Rad ELISA plate reader. The ability of macrophage cell surface HSPGs to act as low-affinity FGF receptors and induce signaling via tyrosine kinase FGF receptors was assessed using glutaraldehyde-fixed macrophages and FGFR1-transfected BaF32 cells in a modification of the proliferation assay described by Richard et al. (37Richard C. Liuzzo J.P. Moscatelli D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24188-24196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) and Filla et al. (38Filla M.S. Dam P. Rapraeger A.C. J. Cell. Physiol. 1998; 174: 310-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). In this modification, proliferation was measured as mitochondrial NADH/NADPH-dependent dehydrogenase activity in a colorimetric assay in which the substrate MTS (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethyoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium inner salt) is reduced to a water-soluble formazan dye. Briefly, fresh monocytes or cytokine-stimulated MDM were fixed with glutaraldehyde (1%, w/v in PBS, pH 7.5), blocked with glycine (0.1 m in PBS, pH 7.5, 30 min) and suspended in RPMI 1640, 0.5% fetal calf serum. Fixed cells (1.5–3 × 105) were then mixed with an equal volume of BaF32 cells (3 × 105/ml) and recombinant FGF-2 (10 nm, final concentration) in the same medium in 96-well microtiter plates (final volume 180 μl/well) and incubated for 3–5 days at 37 °C. At the end of this period, MTS (150 μm in water) was added to each well and the plates developed at 37 °C for 1 h before spectrophotometry on a Bio-Rad ELISA plate reader at 595 nm. To measure cell surface HSPG expression in primary human monocyte/macrophages, we exploited the specificity of the monoclonal antibody 3G10 to detect unsaturated Δ4,5 glucuronyl residues in core HS chains generated by prior treatment of intact cells with the enzyme heparan sulfate lyase. We first questioned whether mobilization of HS to the cell surface is triggered by differentiation of blood monocytes to MDMs or by exposure to pro-inflammatory mediators that activate macrophages and induce synthesis of heparin-binding growth factors. The results (Fig.1, A and B) indicate cell surface HS is indeed up-regulated severalfold on the majority of MDM (characterized by elevated expression of the high affinity Fcγ receptor FcγRI, CD14 and MHC class II histocompatibility antigens, data not shown) within 24 h of differentiation from monocytes and to a further extent on MDM treated with either bacterial lipopolysaccharide or interleukin-1α. This newly mobilized HS appears to be homogeneously distributed over the surface of individual MDM as assessed by immunofluorescent staining with the mAb 10E4, which binds intact HS (Fig. 1 C). Interestingly, no comparable levels of HS were detected on the surface of mitogen-activated human T cells, indicating that the capacity for extensive cell surface HS mobilization is not a general property of hemopoietic cells (Fig. 1 A). The specificity of the HS mAbs in each of these experiments was confirmed by separate controls, which showed that surface staining with the 3G10 mAb depended on pretreatment of macrophages with heparinase III and that surface staining with the 10E4 mAb was reduced by digestion with this enzyme (not shown). To identify the proteoglycan core proteins decorated with HS, we treated intact monocyte-derived macrophages with heparinase III and analyzed whole cell lysates by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting with the Δ4,5 glucuronosyl sugar-reactive mAb 3G10. The results (Fig. 2) revealed the presence of a single major 48-kDa band on MDM whose abundance was further increased by the inflammatory mediators IL-1α, TNFα, and LPS and which was completely absent from unstimulated monocytes. Size comparisons with the previously characterized (39Steinfeld R. van den Berghe H. David G. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 405-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar) core proteins of syndecan-1 (85 kDa), syndecan-2 (48 kDa), syndecan-4 (35 kDa), and glypican-1 (65 kDa) in whole cell lysates prepared from cloned cDNA-transfected human Namalwa B-lymphoma cells revealed co-migration of"

In the case of tubulin, newly synthesized α- and β-subunits are partially folded by cytosolic chaperonin, a double-toroidal ATPase with homologs in all kingdoms of life and in most cellular compartments. α- and β-tubulin folding intermediates are then brought together by tubulin-specific chaperone proteins (named cofactors A–E) in a cofactor-containing supercomplex with GTPase activity. Here we show that tubulin subunit exchange can only occur by passage through this supercomplex, thus defining it as a dimer-making machine. We also show that hydrolysis of GTP by β-tubulin in the supercomplex acts as a switch for the release of native tubulin heterodimer. In this folding reaction and in the related reaction of tubulin-folding cofactors with native tubulin, the cofactors behave as GTPase-activating proteins, stimulating the GTP-binding protein β-tubulin to hydrolyze its GTP.

Both α- and β-tubulins are GTP-binding proteins; α-tubulin binds GTP nonexchangeably, whereas the GTP-binding site on β-tubulin is exchangeable (1Spiegelman B.M. Penningroth S.M. Kirschner M.W. Cell. 1977; 12: 587-600Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). GTP hydrolysis by β-tubulin is a key element in determining the dynamic behavior of microtubules; the hydrolysis of GTP is coupled to tubulin polymerization such that variation in the size of the “cap” of GTP-bound subunits on a given microtubule determines whether it will continue to grow or undergo transition to a rapidly depolymerizing phase (2Kirschner M.W.

Recent analysis of the tubulin folding pathway has shown that the α and β polypeptides must interact with a series of chaperone proteins before reaching the native state (reviewed in Ref. 5Lewis S.A. Tian G. Cowan N.J. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 479-485Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The first step in this pathway is the binding of newly synthesized (or denatured) tubulin molecules to cytosolic chaperonin (6Gao Y. Thomas J.O. Chow R.L. Lee G.H. Cowan N.J. Cell. 1992; 69: 1043-1050Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar) (also referred to as TRiC (7Frydman J. Nimmesgern E. Erdjument-Bromage H. Wall J.S. Tempst P. Hartl F.U.

Following one or more rounds of ATP hydrolysis by cytosolic chaperonin, the resulting quasi-native tubulin intermediates interact with tubulin-specific chaperones named cofactors A–E (9Gao Y. Melki R. Walden P.D. Lewis S.A. Ampe C. Rommelaere H. Vandekerckhove J. Cowan N.J. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 989-996Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 10Tian G. Huang Y. Rommelaere H.

Cowan N.J. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 821-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Native tubulin is released from a supercomplex that contains both α- and β-tubulin and cofactors C, D, and E and that hydrolyzes GTP as part of this reaction (5Lewis S.A. Tian G. Cowan N.J. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 479-485Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 11Tian G. Lewis S.A. Feierbach B. Stearns T. Rommelaere H. Ampe C. Cowan N.J. J.

Cell Sci. 1993; 106: 627-632Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).We sought to determine the nature of the GTP hydrolysis reaction performed by the tubulin-cofactor supercomplex and its role in producing native tubulin. Here we show that both in the folding reaction and in the related reaction of cofactors with native tubulin, the cofactors act as GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs),1 stimulating many-fold the negligible intrinsic GTPase activity of the tubulin to which they are bound.DISCUSSIONThe simple and direct data presented here showing that α- and β-tubulin subunits do not exchange in the absence of tubulin-folding cofactors imply either that the subunits are very tightly associated in the heterodimer or that they denature as they dissociate. The latter explanation cannot be true, however, because this would imply that tubulin is highly unstable, which it is not, even at concentrations below the reported dissociation constant of the heterodimer, long thought to be in the micromolar range (21Detrich H.W.D. Williams R.C. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 3900-3907Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 22Mejillano M.R. Himes R.H. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 6518-6524Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 23Panda D. Roy S. Bhattacharyya B.

The conclusion is inescapable that the subunits of the tubulin heterodimer are tightly bound to each other and are not in free equilibrium. There are compelling recent data that support this surprising finding; when tubulin is bound to a column via antibody specific to the α-subunit, the β-subunit cannot be dissociated unless it is exposed to Tris buffer at high pH (34Giraudel A. Lafanechere L. Ronjat M. Wehland J. Garel J.-R. Wilson L. Job D. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 8724-8734Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). How then can we explain the corpus of results that have been interpreted to reflect a micromolar dissociation constant for the heterodimer? If tubulin undergoes some concentration-dependent conformational change (but does not dissociate), this would account for many of these experimental results.Our data imply that the process whereby tubulin heterodimers are assembled includes a quality control step. We know that only dimer, not individual subunits, can be released from the supercomplex, because dimers can only exchange subunits via the supercomplex (Fig. 1). Furthermore, dimer is released only when it has demonstrated its ability to hydrolyze GTP (Fig. 1, C and E). In support of this interpretation, tubulin molecules with mutations that are predicted to abolish GTP hydrolysis are not assembled into microtubules when expressed in vivo and remain complexed with cofactors when made in vitro (35Zabala J.C. Fontalba A. Avila J. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 1471-1478Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Additionally, in a genetic screen for viable yeast harboring β-tubulin mutations that altered rates of GTP hydrolysis, only mutations that increased the rate of hydrolysis were found (36Davis A. Sage C.R. Dougherty C.A. Farrell K.W. Science. 1994; 264: 839-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Many toxins bind to tubulin and interfere with its polymerization, some by changing the GTPase activity of tubulin (reviewed in Ref. 31Hamel E. Med. Res. Rev. 1996; 16: 207-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). These toxins can poison microtubules substoichiometrically; if poisoned subunits are added to the growing end of a microtubule, the growth and stability of the whole tubule is affected (32Schilstra M.J. Martin S.R. Bayley P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8827-8834Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 37Vandecandelaere A. Martin S.R. Schilstra M.J. Bayley P.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 2792-2801Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). By analogy, the quality control of tubulin by cofactors in vivo may be important for protecting the microtubules of the cell from poisoning by misfolded, non-GTP-hydrolyzing subunits. In addition to acting in the de novo folding pathway (10Tian G. Huang Y. Rommelaere H. Vandekerckhove J. Ampe C. Cowan N.J. Cell. 1996; 86: 287-296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar, 11Tian G. Lewis S.A. Feierbach B. Stearns T. Rommelaere H. Ampe C. Cowan N.J. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 821-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), cofactors can interact with native tubulin dimer to convert GTP-tubulin to GDP-tubulin (Fig. 2); this process could function in the quality control of the pool of tubulin in the cell and/or in regulating tubulin polymerization.Many GTP-binding proteins, including the heterotrimeric G proteins and the Ras-related small GTP-binding proteins, hydrolyze GTP at a very low intrinsic rate that can be increased enormously by the binding of specific GAPs. These proteins appear to contribute an “arginine finger” to the catalytic site of the GTP-binding protein and in doing so activate it (38Sceffzek K. Ahmadian M.R. Wittinghofer A. Trends Biochem. 1998; 23: 257-262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). Although the GTP-binding site of tubulin and the related bacterial protein FtsZ have a different fold from that of all other GTP-binding proteins (39Nogales E. Downing K.H. Amos L.A. Lowe J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 451-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar, 40Nogales E. Wolf S.G. Downing K.H. Nature. 1998; 391: 199-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (1778) Google Scholar), the experiments described here show that, like other GTP-binding proteins, a specific GAP (in this case tubulin-folding cofactors) stimulates the negligible intrinsic GTP hydrolysis rate of tubulin by orders of magnitude. In this sense, α-tubulin also behaves like a GAP when it interacts with the GTP-binding domain of an adjacent β-subunit during microtubule polymerization (39Nogales E. Downing K.H. Amos L.A. Lowe J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 451-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar, 41Erickson H.P. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 133-137Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). One of the tubulin-folding cofactors and α-tubulin may therefore share some structural homology that allows each to contribute to the catalytic site of β-tubulin polypeptides in tubulin-cofactor supercomplexes and in microtubules, respectively. Tubulin is an α/β heterodimer. Both α- and β-tubulins are GTP-binding proteins; α-tubulin binds GTP nonexchangeably, whereas the GTP-binding site on β-tubulin is exchangeable (1Spiegelman B.M.

Trends Biochem. 1998; 23: 257-262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). Although the GTP-binding site of tubulin and the related bacterial protein FtsZ have a different fold from that of all other GTP-binding proteins (39Nogales E. Downing K.H. Amos L.A. Lowe J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 451-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar, 40Nogales E. Wolf S.G. Downing K.H. Nature. 1998; 391: 199-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (1778) Google Scholar), the experiments described here show that, like other GTP-binding proteins, a specific GAP (in this case tubulin-folding cofactors) stimulates the negligible intrinsic GTP hydrolysis rate of tubulin by orders of magnitude. In this sense, α-tubulin also behaves like a GAP when it interacts with the GTP-binding domain of an adjacent β-subunit during microtubule polymerization (39Nogales E. Downing K.H. Amos L.A. Lowe J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 451-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar, 41Erickson H.P. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 133-137Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). One of the tubulin-folding cofactors and α-tubulin may therefore share some structural homology that allows each to contribute to the catalytic site of β-tubulin polypeptides in tubulin-cofactor supercomplexes and in microtubules, respectively. The simple and direct data presented here showing that α- and β-tubulin subunits do not exchange in the absence of tubulin-folding cofactors imply either that the subunits are very tightly associated in the heterodimer or that they denature as they dissociate. The latter explanation cannot be true, however, because this would imply that tubulin is highly unstable, which it is not, even at concentrations below the reported dissociation constant of the heterodimer, long thought to be in the micromolar range (21Detrich H.W.D. Williams R.C. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 3900-3907Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 22Mejillano M.R. Himes R.H. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 6518-6524Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 23Panda D. Roy S. Bhattacharyya B. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 9709-9716Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 24Sackett D.L. Zimmerman D.A. Wolff J. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 2662-2667Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The conclusion is inescapable that the subunits of the tubulin heterodimer are tightly bound to each other and are not in free equilibrium. There are compelling recent data that support this surprising finding; when tubulin is bound to a column via antibody specific to the α-subunit, the β-subunit cannot be dissociated unless it is exposed to Tris buffer at high pH (34Giraudel A. Lafanechere L. Ronjat M. Wehland J. Garel J.-R. Wilson L. Job D. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 8724-8734Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). How then can we explain the corpus of results that have been interpreted to reflect a micromolar dissociation constant for the heterodimer? If tubulin undergoes some concentration-dependent conformational change (but does not dissociate), this would account for many of these experimental results. Our data imply that the process whereby tubulin heterodimers are assembled includes a quality control step. We know that only dimer, not individual subunits, can be released from the supercomplex, because dimers can only exchange subunits via the supercomplex (Fig. 1). Furthermore, dimer is released only when it has demonstrated its ability to hydrolyze GTP (Fig. 1, C and E). In support of this interpretation, tubulin molecules with mutations that are predicted to abolish GTP hydrolysis are not assembled into microtubules when expressed in vivo and remain complexed with cofactors when made in vitro (35Zabala J.C. Fontalba A. Avila J. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 1471-1478Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Additionally, in a genetic screen for viable yeast harboring β-tubulin mutations that altered rates of GTP hydrolysis, only mutations that increased the rate of hydrolysis were found (36Davis A. Sage C.R. Dougherty C.A. Farrell K.W. Science. 1994; 264: 839-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Many toxins bind to tubulin and interfere with its polymerization, some by changing the GTPase activity of tubulin (reviewed in Ref. 31Hamel E. Med. Res. Rev. 1996; 16: 207-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). These toxins can poison microtubules substoichiometrically; if poisoned subunits are added to the growing end of a microtubule, the growth and stability of the whole tubule is affected (32Schilstra M.J. Martin S.R. Bayley P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8827-8834Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 37Vandecandelaere A. Martin S.R. Schilstra M.J. Bayley P.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 2792-2801Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). By analogy, the quality control of tubulin by cofactors in vivo may be important for protecting the microtubules of the cell from poisoning by misfolded, non-GTP-hydrolyzing subunits. In addition to acting in the de novo folding pathway (10Tian G. Huang Y. Rommelaere H. Vandekerckhove J. Ampe C. Cowan N.J.

https://openalex.org/W2021621042,"A common event in the development of human neoplasia is the loss of growth regulatory tumor suppressor functions. Methylation of 5′ CpG islands of tumor suppressor genes and elevated levels of the DNA-(cytosine-5)-methyltransferase enzyme (DNA MeTase) are also prevalent features of human neoplasia. However, direct evidence that elevated DNA MeTase levels alter gene expression and influence oncogenesis has been difficult to obtain, in part due to the lack of specific DNA MeTase inhibitors. Here we show that specific reduction of cellular DNA MeTase levels in human cancer cells with potent antisense inhibitors: 1) causes demethylation of the p16ink4A gene promoter; 2) causes re-expression of the p16ink4A protein; 3) leads to accumulation of the hypophosphorylated form of the retinoblastoma protein (pRb); and 4) inhibits cell proliferation. Stepwise reduction of cellular DNA MeTase protein levels also induced a corresponding rapid increase in the cell cycle regulator p21WAF/Cip1 protein demonstrating a regulatory link between DNA MeTase and the growth regulator p21WAF/Cip1 that is independent of methylation of DNA. These results suggest that the elevated levels of DNA MeTase seen in cancer cells can inhibit tumor suppressors by distinct mechanisms involving either transcriptional inactivation through DNA methylation or by a methylation independent regulation.

DNA 5-cytosine methyltransferase 5-azacytidine 5-azadeoxycytidine polymerase chain reaction methylation-specific PCR proliferating cell nuclear antigen In mammals, methylation of the 5′ position of cytosine in the CpG dinucleotide sequence is the only naturally occurring covalent modification of the genome. The enzyme DNA 5-cytosine methyltransferase (DNA MeTase)1 catalyzes the transfer of a methyl group from S-adenosylmethionine to the 5 position of cytosines residing in the dinucleotide sequence CpG (1Adams R.L. McKay E.L. Craig L.M. Burdon R.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1979; 561: 345-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). DNA methylation patterns correlate inversely with gene expression (2Yeivin A. Razin A. EXS. 1993; 64: 523-568PubMed Google Scholar) and, therefore, DNA methylation has been suggested to be an epigenetic determinant of gene expression. However, experimental inhibition of the DNA MeTase has relied for the most part on the nucleoside analogs 5-azacytidine (5-aza-C) and 5-azadeoxycytidine (5-aza-CdR) (3Jones P.A. Cell. 1985; 40: 485-486Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). These nucleoside analogs affect many cellular processes and have been shown to alter cellular differentiation even in organisms that do not bear methylated bases in their genomes (4Tamame M. Antequera F. Villanueva J.R. Santos T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1983; 3: 2287-2297Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). 5-Aza-C is mutagenic and causes DNA damage in fission yeast (5Taylor E.M. McFarlane R.J. Price C. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1996; 253: 128-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) and in Escherichia coli (6Lal D. Som S. Friedman S. Mutat. Res. 1988; 193: 229-236PubMed Google Scholar). To exert their biological effects, 5-aza-C and 5-aza-CdR must be incorporated into the DNA where they covalently trap the bulky 190-kDa DNA methyltransferase enzyme onto the DNA (7Juttermann R. Li E. Jaenisch R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11797-11801Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar). The covalent trapping of DNA MeTase to the DNA and not hypomethylation of DNA itself is reported to be the cause of the mutagenic and cytotoxic effects of 5-aza-CdR (7Juttermann R. Li E. Jaenisch R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11797-11801Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar). Experiments in which the DNA MeTase has been inhibited by genetic means, for example, by targeted disruption of the DNA MeTase gene in mice, resulted in directly opposite effects on gene expression to those observed with 5-aza-CdR treatment (8Efstratiadis A. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1994; 4: 265-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 9Eversole-Cire P. et al.Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 8: 4928-4938Crossref Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 10Haaf T. Schmid M. Chromosoma. 1989; 98: 93-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Therefore, 5-aza-C and 5-aza-CdR may alter gene expression by mechanisms unrelated to the inhibition of DNA MeTase; for example, by modifying chromatin structure, as has been suggested (11Hori T.A. Mutat Res. 1983; 121: 47-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 12Lengauer C. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2545-2550Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar, 13Haaf T. Pharmacol. Ther. 1995; 65: 19-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). In fact, inhibition of the histone deacetylases, enzymes known to modify chromatin structure, by trichostatin A, has recently been found to reverse methylation-dependent transcriptional silencing (14Nan X. Ng H.H. Johnson C.A. Laherty C.D. Turner B.M. Eisenman R.N. Bird A. Nature. 1998; 393: 386-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (2750) Google Scholar, 15Jones P.L. Veenstra G.L. Wade P.A Vermaak D. Kass S.U. Landsberger N. Strouboulis J. Wolffe A.P. Nat. Genet. 1998; 19: 187-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (2226) Google Scholar). This has prompted the suggestion that much of the transcriptional repression seen is due to histone acetylation and has reopened questions on the role of DNA MeTase in transcriptional repression (16Bestor T.H. Nature. 1998; 393: 311-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). In addition to the potential role the DNA MeTase plays in gene expression, it is also implicated in oncogenesis. Elevated levels of DNA MeTase activity have been observed in many cancer cells in vitro (17Kautiainen T.L. Jones P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 1594-1598Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and tumors in vivo (18el-Deiry W.S. et al.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3470-3474Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar, 19Belinsky S.A. Nikula K.J. Baylin S.B. Issa J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4045-4050Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Activation of the oncogenic ras signal transduction pathway has been shown to induce DNA MeTase expression (20MacLeod R.A. Rouleau J. Szyf M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11327-11337Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 21Rouleau J. MacLeod R.A. Szyf M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1595-1601Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). In addition, elevated DNA MeTase levels are required to maintain the phenotype of these ras- transformed cells, suggesting that DNA methyltransferase is an important downstream effector of these pathways (22MacLeod R.A. Szyf M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8037-8043Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). This is supported by the recent finding that increased DNA MeTase levels are required to maintain the phenotype of fibroblasts transformed with the fos oncogene (23Bakin A.V. Curran T. Science. 1999; 283: 387-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Thus, to isolate the role of the DNA MeTase itself in gene expression and cancer and to dissociate it from effects on chromatin structure requires specific DNA MeTase inhibitors that are not incorporated into genomic DNA. To this aim we have developed potent antisense inhibitors capable of specifically reducing cellular DNA MeTase levels and have employed these inhibitors to study the response of cancer cells to reduction of cellular DNA MeTase levels. Cells were treated with the 4 × 4 hybrid 2′-O-methylphosphorothioate antisense oligonucleotides; MG88 sequence (5′-AAGC ATGAGCACCGTT CTCC-3′, where bold nucleotides are 2′-O-methyl modified) and MG208 (5′-AA CGATCAGGACCCTTG TCC- 3′) at doses from 0 (Lipofectin alone) to 80 nm in the presence of Lipofectin (6.25 μg/ml). The cells were incubated for 24 h in complete medium. For longer treatments (2–10 days) the cells were transfected with oligonucleotides every day and split every second day. Whole cell lysates and nuclear extracts were prepared as described (51Szyf M. Bozovic V. Tanigawa G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10027-10030Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The antibodies used were as follow monoclonal antibodies p16INK4 and retinoblastoma (Rb) from PharMingen, monoclonal antibody Cip1 (p21WAF1/CIP1) from Transduction Laboratories, affinity purified polyclonal antibodies actin(l-19) from Santa Cruz, and MET TB antibody raised against glutathione S-transferase fusion protein from the first 10-kDa amino terminus site from methyltransferase. Horseradish peroxidase (Sigma) was used as secondary antibody following by ECL (Amersham). Proteins (600–800 μg) were incubated with p16INK4 (C-20) from Santa Cruz according to their specificity, at 4 °C for 1 h. Protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was added for an additional 30 min. The samples were washed in IP buffer (Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 5 mm EDTA, 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5), eluted in sample buffer ans and loaded onto SDS-polyacrylamide gradient gel (4–20%). Autoradiographic films were scanned on a HP Scanjet 5P scanner, digital images were imported in Adobe photoshop and figures assembled. Using the Oncor p16 detection system, PCR was performed in a total volume of 25 μl under the following conditions: 100 ng of bisulfate-treated DNA (Oncor), 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 50 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 250 μm dNTPs, 80 ng of each primers (5′-GTAGGTGGGGAGGAGTTTAGTTT-3′ sense and 5′-TCTAATAACCAACCAACCCCTAA-3′ antisense) and 1 unit of AmpliTaq Gold (Perkin-Elmer). The denaturation cycle 95 °C; 12 min was following to 35 cycles at 95 °C; 45 s, 60 °C; 45 s, 72 °C; 60 s, and an elongation cycle 72 °C; 10 min. The PCR product (5 μl) was analyzed on 2% agarose gel. The unmethylated (U) and demethylated (D) primers (Oncor) are also used at the same conditions as specific primers. PCR products were subcloned into PCR 2.1 (Invitrogen) and sequenced to determine demethylation of CpG sites in the p16 proximal promoter. To identify antisense oligodeoxynucleotides capable of inhibiting DNA MeTase gene expression in human tumor cells, 85 phosphorothioate oligodeoxynucleotides (20 bases in length) bearing sequences complementary to the 5′ and 3′ regions of the human DNA MeTase mRNA as well as oligonucleotides targeted to intron-exon boundaries were synthesized and screened for antisense activity (Fig.1 A). Antisense oligodeoxynucleotides have been shown to act through an RNase H-dependent cleavage of the target mRNA (24Crooke S.T. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1993; 32: 329-376Crossref Scopus (414) Google Scholar, 25Monia B.P. Lesnik E.A. Gonzalez C. Lima W.F. McGee D. Guinosso C.J. Kawasaki A.M. Cook P.D. Freier S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14514-14522Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which then following turnover of previously synthesized protein leads to a reduction in target protein. Two DNA MeTase mRNA regions highly sensitive to antisense inhibition were identified in this screen. These potent DNA MeTase antisense inhibitors, MG88 and MG98, are termed second generation antisense molecules because they contain both phosphorothioate backbone modifications as well as a 2′-O-methyl modifications to the ribose on the four 3′ and 5′ terminal nucleotides. The combination of these chemistries increases stability and potency of the inhibitors, thus allowing very low (nanomolar) concentrations to be used experimentally, thus minimizing nonspecific effects. MG88 and MG98 have IC50 values of 40 and 45 nm for inhibition of DNA MeTase mRNA, respectively. Both inhibitors demonstrated sequence-dependent inhibition of the DNA MeTase as scrambled and mismatch, control oligodeoxynucleotides of either one had no effect on DNA MeTase levels. In the experiments presented here we focused on the DNA MeTase antisense inhibitor MG88. Treatment of T24 human bladder cancer cells and A549 human non-small cell lung cancer cells with 0–80 nm antisense inhibitor MG88, a 20-base second generation chemistry phosphorothioate oligonucleotide targeted to the DNA MeTase 5′ region for 48 h, produced dose-dependent reduction in DNA MeTase protein levels (Fig. 1 B). Treatment with the mismatch control oligomer MG208 (a 20-base second generation oligonucleotide with the same sequence as MG88 except 6 mismatched bases) or with Lipofectin alone produced no inhibition of DNA MeTase (Fig. 1 B). The non-target protein, α-actin, was used as a control for protein loading (Fig. 1 B). Several other human tumor cell lines, including the breast cancer lines MDA-MB231, MCF-7, the lung cancer cell line, H446, and the colon cancer cell lines HCT116, SW48, and LoVo were used to evaluate the activities of MG88 and MG208 with essentially identical results (data not shown). The cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor (CDKI) p16ink4A regulates the transition from G1 to S-phases of the cell cycle (26Serrano M. Hannon G.J. Beach D. Nature. 1993; 366: 704-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (3360) Google Scholar). Inactivation of p16ink4A is one of the most frequently observed abnormalities in human cancer (26Serrano M. Hannon G.J. Beach D. Nature. 1993; 366: 704-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (3360) Google Scholar). Genetic alterations in p16ink4A, including point mutations (27Hussussian C.J. et al.Nat.

Transcriptional inactivation and associated hypermethylation of the p16ink4A promoter region have also been observed in virtually all types of cancer (31Gonzalez-Zulueta M. Bender C.M. Yang A.S.

Treatment of cells with toxic doses of 5-aza-CdR can cause demethylation and induction of p16ink4A mRNA, detectable by reverse transcriptase-PCR, after recovery from the immediate toxic effects of this drug (31Gonzalez-Zulueta M.

To investigate the effect of specifically reducing cellular DNA MeTase levels on the expression and methylation status of a silenced p16ink4A gene, we treated the T24 human bladder cancer cells that contain a hypermethylated and silenced p16ink4A gene, with the human DNA MeTase inhibitor MG88. Re-expression of p16ink4A protein was detected after 5 days of treatment with either 40 or 75 nm MG88 (Fig.2 A). The latency of the reactivation is expected as inhibition of any molecular target (DNA MeTase in this case) by antisense requires first, that the target mRNA levels are reduced and then that turnover of previously synthesized protein is completed, in contrast to small molecule inhibitors of proteins that directly inhibit the target enzyme. In addition, in the absence of any active demethylating activity, demethylation by decreased methylation capacity is a passive process that requires DNA replication. p16ink4A reactivation was both dose-dependent and time-dependent (Fig.2 A). Due to the antiproliferative effect of MG88 itself (see Fig. 3 C), p16ink4Alevels were normalized to cell number (Fig. 2 A, graph). p16ink4A was not detected in cells treated with either 40 or 75 nm of the mismatch control MG208 or Lipofectin alone (Fig.2 A). As expected, cellular DNA MeTase levels were reduced by MG88 but not by MG208 (Fig. 2 A, lower panel).Figure 3Effect of DNA MeTase inhibition on DNA methylation by MSP, bisulfite sequencing, and cell growth. A, methylation-specific PCR (28Caldas C. et al.Nat. Genet. 1994; 8: 27-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (1112) Google Scholar) of the p16ink4Apromoter was performed on treated T24 cells at the indicated days. PCR primers specific for methylated p16ink4A (M) and unmethylated p16ink4A (U) show that demethylation occurred in MG88-treated cells only, as early as day 3.B, bisulfite genomic sequencing results of the p16ink4A proximal promoter.

Panel 2, growth curve of single cell clones isolated after a 5-day treatment with MG88 (MGC4-5), MG208 (MG208C2-5), or Lipofectin (MGlipoC5).

Proliferation of MG88C4-5 was slow compared with control clones (MG208C2-4, Lipofectin MGlipoC5) from days 40 to 45 post-treatment when growth rate increase rapidly.

Hannon G.J. Beach D. Nature. 1993; 366: 704-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (3360) Google Scholar). Reactivation of p16ink4A by MG88 treatment caused decrease in the phosphorylated forms of pRb, thus increasing the relative abundance of hypophosphorylated form of pRb overphosphorylated forms of pRb, while treatment of cells with either Lipofectin alone or the control MG208 did not alter the phosphorylation of pRb (Fig. 2 D). These results demonstrate that high levels of DNA MeTase in T24 cells actively suppresses p16ink4A gene expression and that inhibition of DNA MeTase restores functional p16ink4Aexpression capable of regulating downstream molecular targets, such as pRb. It is not known whether the DNA MeTase enzyme targeted by MG88 (Dnmt1) encodes only maintenance DNA methyltransferase activity or de novo methylation activity as well (37Warnecke P.M. Biniszkiewicz D. Jaenisch R. Frommer M. Clark S.J. Dev. Genet. 1998; 22: 111-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 38Woodcock D.M. Linsenmeyer M.E. Warren W.D.

Soman N.S. Verdine G.L. Bestor T.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 270: 385-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). To determine whether de novo methylation and silencing of the re-expressed p16ink4A gene occurs when DNA MeTase returns to control levels, treatments were stopped after 10 days and p16ink4A and DNA MeTase protein levels were determined on days 3, 5, and 7 post-treatment. High dose MG88 treatment (75 nm) reduced cell numbers by inhibition of proliferation and resulted in cell death after day 10 of treatment, therefore analysis of the duration of p16ink4A expression was restricted to MG88 40 nm treatments. DNA MeTase protein levels increased as expected in the absence of MG88 treatment and returned to control levels between days 5–7 post-treatment (Fig. 2 C, middle panel). p16ink4A protein expression decreased steadily over the post-treatment period until it was barely detectable at day 7 post-treatment (Fig. 2 B, upper panel). Fig. 2 D shows the inverse relationship between DNA MeTase levels and p16ink4A levels during and after the treatment period. Of note is the fact that loss of p16ink4A expression begins at day 14 after DNA MeTase has returned to near control levels. This lag suggests that elevated levels of DNA MeTase over several rounds of replication are required to methylate and inactivate p16ink4Agene expression. That the inactivation and de novo methylation of p16ink4A observed are coincident with elevated levels of the DNA MeTase (Dnmt1) suggests that it may contribute to de novo methylation activity itself. To identify changes in the methylation status of the p16ink4Apromoter induced by MG88 treatment we performed MSP (41Herman J.G. Merlo A. Mao L. Lapidus R.G. Issa J.P. Davidson N.E Sidransky D. Baylin S.B. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 4525-4530PubMed Google Scholar) and bisulfite genomic sequencing (42Frommer M. McDonald L.E. Millar D.S. Collis C.M Watt F. Grigg G.W. Molloy P.L. Paul C.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1827-1831Crossref PubMed Scopus (2491) Google Scholar). MSP analysis revealed that demethylation of the p16ink4A promoter region occurred as early as day 3 of MG88 treatment (Fig. 3 A). Treatment with MG208 or Lipofectin alone had no effect on methylation of the p16ink4A gene (Fig.3 A). Employing bisulfite genomic sequencing provided a more detailed dissection of the demethylaltion events at the p16ink4A promoter. Analysis of several clones for each treatment condition revealed that 15 CpG sites within the p16ink4A promoter are methylated in untreated T24 cells (Fig.3 B). Inhibition of the DNA MeTase by MG88 led to demethylation at 5 of 15 CpG sites by day 3 and demethylation at all 15 CpG sites by day 5 of treatment, whereas treatment with the control MG208 had no effect on p16ink4A methylation status (Fig.3 B). Three days after cessation of MG88 treatment the p16ink4A promoter shows significant re-methylation at 13 of 15 sites reflecting either de novo methylation of these sites or a rapid expansion of a less affected population (Fig.3 B). To study the effect of specific inhibition of DNA MeTase on cell growth we monitored cellular proliferation rates both during the treatment and post-treatment periods to determine the duration of the effect. During the course of treatment MG88 dramatically inhibited cell proliferation, whereas treatment of cells with the control MG208 caused only minimal growth inhibition relative to Lipofectin-treated cells (Fig. 3 C, panel I). Inhibition of cell proliferation persisted for approximately 1 week post-treatment, consistent with the finding that p16ink4A expression was maintained until 7 days after the last dose of MG88 (Fig. 2 C). To determine whether the loss of p16ink4A expression after reactivation by short term treatment with MG88 was due to the proliferation of a less affected (less demethylated) population of cells within the treated population, or to rapid inactivation of p16ink4A after MG88 withdrawal, we isolated single cell clones after treatment. Several MG88 clones were, in fact, p16ink4A negative (data not shown), confirming as expected that MG88 treatment produce a mixed population of p16ink4A positive and negative cells. Isolation and methylation analysis of a MG88-treated p16ink4A expressing clone (MG88C4-5) revealed that the p16ink4A promoter region was completely non-methylated at all CpG sites evaluated even after 30 days in culture post-MG88 treatment (Fig. 3 D). Thus demonstrating that even short-term (5 day) inhibition of the DNA MeTase by MG88 could induce sustained re-expression of a silenced tumor suppressor gene. Clone MG88C4-5 grew very slowly compared with clones isolated after Lipofectin or MG208 treatment (Fig. 3 C, panel 2); however, after 40–45 days in culture post-treatment, the growth rate of MG88C4-5 cells increased dramatically (Fig. 3 C, panel 2). Determination of p16ink4A protein levels in MG88C4-5 cells revealed a significant decrease at this time point (Fig. 3 C, inset). Loss of p16ink4A expression after prolonged culture in the absence of MG88 treatment suggests that the DNA MeTase targeted (thought to encode maintenance DNA MeTase activity) may have de novo methyltransferase activity and over time can methylate and inactivate previously unmethylated actively expressing genes. The antiproliferative effect of DNA MeTase inhibition on T24 cells was apparent as early as 48 h after the first treatment (Fig.3 C), although p16ink4A expression was only detected after day 5 of treatment (Fig. 2 A). Thus, p16ink4A reactivation alone cannot explain the inhibition of proliferation observed. Another member of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor (CDKI) family p21WAF1, inhibits a wide range of cyclin·CDK complexes involved in G1 and S phase progression (43Tam S.W. Shay J.W. Pagano M. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 5816-5820PubMed Google Scholar, 44Baghdassarian N. French M. Hematol. Cell Ther. 1996; 38: 313-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 45Gotz C. Wagner P. Issinger O.G. Montenarh M. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 391-398PubMed Google Scholar). Recently it has been observed that an inverse correlation exists between p21WAF1 and DNA MeTase protein levels in SV40-transformed and nontransformed cells (46Chuang L.S. Ian H.I. Koh T.W. Ng H.H. Xu G. Li B.F. Science. 1997; 277: 1996-2000Crossref PubMed Scopus (784) Google Scholar). In addition, p21WAF1 and the DNA MeTase have recently been shown to compete with each other for binding to proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) (46Chuang L.S. Ian H.I. Koh T.W. Ng H.H. Xu G. Li B.F. Science. 1997; 277: 1996-2000Crossref PubMed Scopus (784) Google Scholar). To investigate whether DNA MeTase and p21WAF1 protein levels are linked by a regulatory pathway, we determined p21WAF1 protein levels in untreated T24 cells and in T24 cells in which DNA MeTase levels had been incrementally reduced by MG88 treatment. p21WAF1 increased directly with the reduction in DNA MeTase (Fig. 4, A and B), while neither Lipofectin nor MG208 had an effect on either DNA MeTase or p21WAF1 levels (Fig. 4, A and B). DNA MeTase inhibition induced p21WAF1 in a dose-dependent fashion as early as 24 h after MG88 treatment (Fig. 4 B), consistent with a role for p21WAF1 in the antiproliferative effect observed (Fig. 3 C). These findings demonstrate that a functional antagonism between DNA MeTase and p21WAF1 on cellular proliferation exists. Furthermore, these results provide evidence that the DNA MeTase plays a direct role in cancer cell proliferation. It has been argued that DNA MeTase should not be involved in proliferation as embryonic stem cells from mice homozygous for Dnmt1 mutation (DNA MeTase knock out) proliferate normally (47Lei H. Oh S.P. Okano M. Juttermann R. Goss K.A. Jaenisch R. Li E. Development (Camb.). 1996; 122: 3195-3205Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, Dnmt1−/− embryonic stem cells die upon differentiation (47Lei H. Oh S.P. Okano M. Juttermann R. Goss K.A. Jaenisch R. Li E. Development (Camb.). 1996; 122: 3195-3205Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), death of these cells, however, can be rescued by the expression of a DNA MeTase isoform expressed from the same Dnmt1 gene (48Gaudet F. Talbot D. Leonhardt H. Jaenisch R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32725-32729Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Although Dnmt1−/− embryonic stem cells proliferate normally, Dnmt1−/− mice die at mid-gestation (49Li E. Bestor T.H. Jaenisch R. Cell. 1992; 69: 915-926Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3197) Google Scholar). Phenotypic and histological analysis of Dnmt1−/− embryos revealed reduced cell proliferation and widespread cell death (49Li E. Bestor T.H. Jaenisch R. Cell. 1992; 69: 915-926Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3197) Google Scholar), supporting a role for DNA MeTase in cell proliferation. To determine if p21WAF1 was induced at the transcriptional level we performed RNase protection assays on cells treated with 40 nm of either MG88 or MG208 for 24 and 48 h. No increase in p21WAF1 mRNA was seen in response to this treatment as demonstrated by RNase protection analysis (Fig.4 C), suggesting that post-translational regulation of the p21WAF1 protein is involved. Given that p21WAF1mRNA levels do not change with and that p21WAF1 protein levels rise rapidly even with minimal inhibition of the DNA MeTase (Fig. 4, A and B), DNA demethylation and transcriptional activation are not likely to be involved as a mechanism of p21WAF1 induction. p21WAF1 controls cell cycle transition at the G1-S boundary by forming a complex with PCNA, cyclin D1, and CDK4 (46Chuang L.S. Ian H.I. Koh T.W. Ng H.H. Xu G. Li B.F. Science. 1997; 277: 1996-2000Crossref PubMed Scopus (784) Google Scholar). Human DNA MeTase can compete with p21WAF1for PCNA binding (46Chuang L.S. Ian H.I. Koh T.W. Ng H.H. Xu G. Li B.F. Science. 1997; 277: 1996-2000Crossref PubMed Scopus (784) Google Scholar). This DNA MeTase-PCNA complex is found in transformed cells with high levels of DNA MeTase but not in non-transformed cells and can be disrupted by p21WAF1-derived peptides (50Ball K.L. Lain S. Fahraeus R. Smythe C. Lane D.P. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 71Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). This competition between DNA MeTase and p21WAF1 for the same binding site on PCNA may explain the inverse relationship and regulation observed. In such a model, high levels of DNA MeTase, as those observed in cancer cells, would compete and displace p21WAF1 from its target PCNA, the free p21WAF1 may be more susceptible to proteolytic degradation than p21WAF1 in a complex with PCNA and other proteins. Conversely, higher levels of p21WAF1 would displace DNA MeTase from PCNA and lead to its degradation. Thus the elevated levels of DNA MeTase found in transformed cells may effectively regulate proliferation both by reducing cellular p21WAF1 levels and by competing directly for the downstream target PCNA. Our findings demonstrate a direct effect of human DNA MeTase levels on DNA methylation patterns and gene expression, and that high levels of human DNA methyltransferase enzyme in cancer cells affects cell growth by a mechanism involving hypermethylation and transcriptional silencing of tumor suppressor genes (p16ink4A) and by an alternate mechanism, most likely mediated by protein-protein interactions, as in the case of p21WAF1. In addition, these finding suggest that non-nucleoside, non-incorporating direct inhibitors of the human DNA MeTase enzyme may be of value in the treatment of human cancer.

The function of the different Grb10 isoforms is not fully elucidated and the data available are also partially discordant. We showed an inhibitory effect of mGrb10 (1Ooi J. Yajnik V. Immanuel D.

The most likely explanation of these data is that different isoforms may have different functions and may compete for common substrates. Recently, Grb10 has been identified as a maternally expressed imprinted gene (Meg) on mouse chromosome 11 (13Miyoshi N. Kuroiwa Y. Kohda T. Shitara H. Yonekawa H. Kawabe T. Hasegawa H. Barton S.C.

More recently, the hGrb10 SH2 domain has been shown to interact with both the Raf1 and MEK1 kinases, and these interactions were phosphotyrosine-independent (14Nantel A. Mohammad-Ali K. Sherk J.

Cell. 1993; 74: 205-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1660) Google Scholar) with full-length mGrb10 as a bait (see “Experimental Procedures”). We isolated a cDNA encoding the C2 domain of mouse Nedd4 (neuronal precursor cell-expresseddevelopmentally down-regulated 4) (20Kumar S. Tomooka Y. Noda M. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Sci. 1994; 19: 531-533Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar) involved in protein-protein interactions with proline-rich PY motifs (23Staub O. Dho S. Henry P.C. Correa J. Ishikawa T. McGlade J. Rotin D.

Using the deletion mutant of Grb10 in the two-hybrid system we show here that both the SH2 domain and the BPS domain of Grb10 are responsible for the binding to the C2 domain of Nedd4, with stronger binding mediated by the SH2 domain. The interactions of mGrb10 and Nedd4 was confirmed in vivo in mouse embryo fibroblasts using co-immunoprecipitation experiments which showed that the endogenous Nedd4 forms a constitutive, Ca2+-independent complex with Grb10, and this interaction is phosphotyrosine-independent. Grb10 was not ubiquitinated in vivo (25Staub O. Gautschi I. Ishikawa T. Breitschopf K. Ciechanover A. Schild L. Rotin D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6325-6336Crossref PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar), raising the possibility that by interacting with Grb10, Nedd4 may come in contact with other proteins such as growth factor receptors and target them for ubiquitination. pRK5-Grb10 plasmid (a kind gift from Dr. Ben Margolis) was cut with Hin dIII, treated with Klenow, and then cut with Sac I. The purified fragment, containing the full-length coding sequence for mGrb10, was cloned in the GAL4 DNA-binding domain of the pAS2-1 yeast cloning and expression vector, digested with Sma I (CLONTECH).

Segregation of the bait plasmid was performed by cyclohexamide selection (as described in CLONTECH instructions) and confirmed by replica plating on plates lacking Leu only or lacking both Trp and Leu, and β-galactosidase filter assay. Trp−Leu+ colonies were then mated with Y187 yeast strain, transformed with the bait plasmid as the positive control, and with the pLAM plasmid (CLONTECH) as the negative control and further analyzed for β-galactosidase activity by filter assay (19Vojtek A.

The mGrb10 1–473 (ΔSH2+BPS) was constructed by cloning an Eco RI/filled/Sca I fragment in the Sma I site of pAS2-1.

The mGrb10-BPS (amino acids 475–518) was cloned inserting the Nco I/Nco I/blunt fragment from pAS2-1-Grb10 into the Sma I site of the pAS2-1 vector. The mGrb10-SH2 (amino acids 518–621) was created inserting the Nco I/Bam HI/filled fragment from pAS2-1-Grb10 into the Nco I/Bam HI/filled site of the pAS2-1 vector. The full-length Nedd4 was created by cutting the Spe I/Apa I fragment from pBS-Nedd4 and cloning into the Spe I/Apa I sites of pGAD-GH AD yeast vector. The interactions were then analyzed transforming the baits alone or co-transforming baits and preys plasmid into Y187 yeast strain and testing the colonies for β-galactosidase activity by filter assay. R-/IR, R-/IR/Grb10, and p6/Grb10 cells were previously described (12Morrione A. Valentinis B. Resnicoff M. Xu S.-Q. Baserga R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26382-26387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar): they are all mouse embryo fibroblasts, overexpressing Grb10 (R-/IR/Grb10 and p6/Grb10); R-/IR/Grb10 and p6/Grb10 cells overexpress, also the same number of the insulin (R-/IR/Grb10) or the IGF-I receptor (p6/Grb10), respectively (12Morrione A.

Cells lysates of exponentially growing cells (1 mg of protein) were immunoprecipitated in HNTG buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 150 mmNaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 0.2 mm sodium orthovanadate, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mg/ml aprotinin) with the following antibodies. For Grb10 with a monoclonal antibody against the Myc tag (Oncogene Science), for Nedd4 with polyclonal antibodies as described (21Kumar S. Harvey K.F. Kinoshita M. Copeland N.G. Noda M. Jenkins N.A. Genomics. 1997; 40: 435-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The immunoprecipitates were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to a nitrocellulose filter. The membranes were then probed with an anti-Grb10 polyclonal antibody (number 309; a kind gift of Dr. Ben Margolis), anti-Nedd4 polyclonal antibody (20Kumar S. Tomooka Y. Noda M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 185: 1155-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar), or anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies (Transduction Laboratories), followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Oncogene Science), or protein A-horseradish peroxidase-linked (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech instructions). Blots were then developed with the ECL system according to the manufacturer's instruction (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). These experiments were performed as described by Plant et al. (27Plant P.J. Yeger H. Staub O. Howard P. Rotin D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32329-32336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Briefly R-/IR cells overexpressing mGrb10 were starved for 24 h in Ca2+-free serum-free medium (Life Technologies, Inc.), washed twice with washing buffer (250 mm sucrose, 10 mm Hepes, pH 6.8, 1 mm EDTA), and then incubated in Ca2+-free medium (140 mm NaCl, 6 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 20 mm glucose, and 20 mmHepes) in the presence or absence of 1.1 mmCaCl2 and 1 μm ionomycin (Calbiochem) for 5 min at 37 °C. Ionomycin in the presence of calcium has been shown previously to increase levels of cytosolic calcium (27Plant P.J. Yeger H. Staub O. Howard P. Rotin D. J. Biol.

The cells were then washed twice with Ca2+-free medium (−Ca2+ conditions) or +Ca2+ medium (+Ca2+ conditions) and then lysed in lysis buffer with or without 1.1 mm CaCl2 and processed for co-immunoprecipitation as described above. R-/IR/Grb10 and p6/Grb10 cells were serum starved for 72 h and then stimulated with 100 ng/ml insulin (Sigma) (R-/IR/Grb10) or 50 ng/ml IGF-I (Life Technologies, Inc.) (p6/Grb10) for 10 min at 37 °C. Cells were then lysed and immunoprecipitated as described above. This method has been described in detail by Staub et al. (25Staub O. Gautschi I. Ishikawa T. Breitschopf K. Ciechanover A. Schild L. Rotin D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6325-6336Crossref PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar). Briefly R-/IR/Grb10 or p6/Grb10 cells overexpressing Grb10 were transiently transfected with a plasmid encoding His-tagged ubiquitin (His-Ub), expressing eight His-tagged ubiquitin molecules under the control of a cytomegalovirus promoter (30Treier M. Staszewski L.M. Bohmann D. Cell. 1994; 78: 787-798Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar). 48 h after Ca2+-phosphate transfection, cells were lysed in lysis buffer containing 50 μm N-acetyl-l-leucinyl-l-leucinyl-l-norleucynal (LLnL) and incubated with Ni2+-NTA-agarose beads (Qiagen) on a rotating wheel for 4 h at 4 °C. The beads containing the histidinated (hence ubiquitinated) bound proteins were washed twice with HNTG plus imidazole and three times with lysis buffer and bound proteins were than separated on 8% SDS-PAGE, transferred to a nitrocellulose filter and probed with anti-Grb10 antibodies as described previously. Alternatively, an eight HA-tagged ubiquitin molecule expressing construct was transfected into cells overexpressing Grb10 and IGF-1R (p6/Grb10) and following immunoprecipitation with anti-Grb10 proteins were immunoblotted with anti-HA antibodies to detect ubiquitinated proteins. We used mGrb10 (1Ooi J. Yajnik V. Immanuel D. Gordon M. Moskow J.J. Buchberg A.M. Margolis B. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1621-1630PubMed Google Scholar) as a bait to screen a mouse embryo library (19Vojtek A. Hollenberg S.M. Cooper J.A. Cell. 1993; 74: 205-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1660) Google Scholar) in the yeast two-hybrid system (18Chien C.T. Bartel P.L. Sternglanz R. Fields S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9578-9582Crossref PubMed Scopus (1225) Google Scholar). One of the cDNA clones isolated (see “Experimental Procedures”) encoded the N-terminal portion of mouse Nedd4 (20Kumar S. Tomooka Y. Noda M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 185: 1155-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar), spanning the entire C2/CaLB (calcium lipid binding) domain (31Clark J.D. Lim L.L. Kriz R. Ramesha C.S. Sultzman L.A. Lin A.Y. Milona N. Knopf J.F. Cell. 1991; 65: 1043-1051Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1459) Google Scholar, 32Rizo J. Sudhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15879-15882Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (707) Google Scholar), from amino acid residue 65 to 237. A full-length Nedd4 was then used to confirm this interaction: as shown in Fig.1, Grb10 strongly interacts with the full-length Nedd4 (amino acids 1–887), confirming the specificity of the interaction. In addition, no β-galactosidase activation was detected with the bait alone, or after co-transformation of the bait with the AD vector alone, or between an unrelated bait (laminin) and Nedd4 (data not shown). To localize the domain of Grb10 responsible for the interaction, we constructed a mGrb10 bait lacking the C-terminal 148 amino acids, a region that includes the newly identified BPS domain (11He W. Rose D.W. Olefsky J.M. Gustafson T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6860-6867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) and the SH2 domain (1Ooi J. Yajnik V. Immanuel D. Gordon M. Moskow J.J. Buchberg A.M. Margolis B. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1621-1630PubMed Google Scholar). This deletion (Fig. 1) completely abolished the interaction with the C2 domain of Nedd4, while with the full-length Nedd4 the interaction was barely above a detectable level. This lack of binding was not due to lack of expression of the truncated bait, because immunoblotting with antibodies against the GAL4-binding domain revealed stronger expression of the truncated than of the full-length Grb10 (data not shown). To further narrow down the domain of Grb10 responsible for the interaction with Nedd4, we constructed three additional mGrb10 deletion mutants: one expressing the BPS domain alone (amino acids 475–518), one expressing the SH2 domain alone (amino acids 518–621), and one expressing both the BPS + SH2 domains (amino acids 475–621). As shown in Fig. 1, both the BPS (amino acids 475–518) and SH2 (amino acids 518–621) domains can independently bind Nedd4, but the SH2 domain seems to bind more strongly. The BPS+SH2 Grb10 mutant (amino acids 475–621) is interacting with Nedd4 with an affinity comparable with the one of the SH2 alone, confirming that the SH2 domain is likely the domain mostly responsible for the interaction. As a control, we tested the level of expression of the deletion mutant fusion proteins by Western blot using antibodies against the GAL4-binding domain; our results show that the mutant proteins were all expressed at comparable levels to the full-length mGrb10 (data not shown). In addition, no β-galactosidase activation was detected with any of the mutant baits alone, nor following co-transformation of the baits with the AD vector alone (data not shown). To confirm these data in mammalian cells, we performed a series of co-immunoprecipitation experiments in mouse embryo fibroblasts (R-/IR) or in mouse embryo fibroblasts overexpressing mGrb10 fused to a Myc tag (R-/IR/Grb10) (12Morrione A. Valentinis B. Resnicoff M. Xu S.-Q. Baserga R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26382-26387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). In addition to Grb10, these cells express high levels of endogenous Nedd4 (Fig. 2, panel A). Thus, exponentially growing cells were lysed and immunoprecipitated with an anti-Myc antibody. As shown in Fig. 2, panel A, Grb10 was immunoprecipitated by Myc antibodies in R-/IR/Grb10 cells, while no Grb10 protein was detectable in R-/IR cells used as a control. Grb10 was clearly able to co-immunoprecipitate the endogenous Nedd4 expressed in R-/IR/Grb10 cells. No Nedd4 protein was detectable in immunoprecipitated R-/IR cells, confirming the specificity of Myc antibodies for the tagged Grb10. The same experiment was then repeated using Nedd4 antibodies: the endogenous Nedd4 (Fig. 2, panel B, overexposed to visualize the co-immunoprecipitated proteins), is co-immunoprecipitating both the overexpressed Myc-tagged Grb10 in R-/IR/Grb10 cells and the endogenous Grb10 present in the R-/IR cells. This experiment demonstrates that endogenous Nedd4 forms a complex with endogenous Grb10 (or with heterologously expressed Grb10) in living cells, suggesting the two proteins likely interact with each other under physiological conditions. Because the C2 domain of Nedd4 has been demonstrated to target Nedd4 to the plasma membrane in response to Ca2+ (27Plant P.J. Yeger H. Staub O. Howard P. Rotin D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32329-32336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), we investigated whether Ca2+ also plays a role in the interaction between Grb10 and the Nedd4-C2 domain. To this end, we performed a series of co-immunoprecipitation experiments in R-/IR cells overexpressing Grb10, starved in Ca2+- and serum-free medium and then stimulated with Ca2+ in the presence of ionomycin (see “Experimental Procedures”). We routinely observed a slightly decreased immunoprecipitation of both Grb10 and Nedd4 by the respective antibodies in the presence of increasing Ca2+concentrations, correlating with a decrease in the amount of the co-immunoprecipitating proteins (for Nedd 4 protein in panel D, this is more evident in a shorter exposure of the film). This is probably due to a reduced affinity of the antibodies or reduced efficiency of the immunoprecipitation in the presence of increasing Ca2+ concentrations. Taking that into account our results show that there was no significant difference in the level of Grb10 and Nedd4 co-immunoprecipitating in the presence or absence of Ca2+ plus ionomycin treatment (Fig.3 panels C, D, and E). Moreover, tyrosyl-phosphorylation of Nedd4 did not seem to be affected by increasing Ca2+ concentrations (Fig.3 C). To further characterize the interaction between Grb10 and the C2 domain of Nedd4, we tested whether Nedd4 co-immunoprecipitating with Grb10 is tyrosyl-phosphorylated: thus, exponentially growing R-/IR cells overexpressing Grb10 were immunoprecipitated with anti-Myc antibody to precipitate Grb10, and the blot was stained with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies. As shown in Fig. 3 (panel A), there is a tyrosyl-phosphorylated band migrating at the expected size of Nedd4 (lanes 1 and 2). To confirm that this band is indeed Nedd4, the blot was stripped and reprobed with anti-Nedd4 antibodies (panel B); the Nedd4 protein (lane 1), clearly detectable in the co-immunoprecipitation, is perfectly overlapping with the tyrosyl-phosphorylated band shown in panel A (lane 1), suggesting that Nedd4 was tyrosyl-phosphorylated. However, only a small fraction of the total phosphorylated Nedd4 protein appears to co-immunoprecipitate with Grb10, suggesting that Grb10 may preferentially associate with the unphosphorylated Nedd4. To investigate if the binding between Grb10 and Nedd4 is regulated by growth factors, we used two different cell lines overexpressing Myc-tagged mGrb10 in combination with either the insulin receptor (R-/IR/Grb10) or the IGF-IR (p6/Grb10) (12Morrione A. Valentinis B. Resnicoff M. Xu S.-Q. Baserga R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26382-26387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The cells were serum-starved, stimulated with insulin (R-/IR/Grb10) or IGF-I (p6/Grb10) (see “Experimental Procedures”), and then immunoprecipitated with either Nedd4 or Myc antibodies. As seen in Fig.4, in both cell lines, we detected co-immunoprecipitation of Grb10 with Nedd4 in both stimulated and unstimulated cells. These results therefore demonstrate that the interaction is constitutive and not modulated by growth factors. The identity of the additional proteins immunoprecipitated by Nedd4 antibodies or co-precipitated with Nedd4 in either the insulin or the IGF-I-stimulated cells is currently unknown. Only a small fraction of the total Nedd4 protein appears to be tyrosine-phosphorylated either by insulin (in R-/IR/Grb10 cells) or IGF-I (in p6/Grb10 cells), and a tyrosyl-phosphorylated Nedd4 is detectable in the co-immunoprecipitation by Myc antibodies only after a longer exposure of the film; it is likely therefore that the majority of the Nedd4 protein is co-immunoprecipitating with Grb10 in a phosphotyrosine-independent manner, in agreement with the data of Fig.3, panels A and B, and the original identification of the interaction in the yeast two-hybrid system. Because Nedd4 is an ubiquitin protein ligase (E3) (20Kumar S. Tomooka Y. Noda M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 185: 1155-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar, 21Kumar S. Harvey K.F.

A. 1995; 92: 2563-2567Crossref PubMed Scopus (700) Google Scholar) we wanted to investigate if Grb10, which interacts with it, is a target for ubiquitination by Nedd4. We therefore tested whether Grb10 is ubiquitinated in vivo, using a previously described methodology (25Staub O. Gautschi I. Ishikawa T. Breitschopf K. Ciechanover A. Schild L. Rotin D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6325-6336Crossref PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar). Thus, we transiently transfected R-/IR cells overexpressing Grb10 with a plasmid encoding His-tagged multiubiquitin (30Treier M. Staszewski L.M. Bohmann D. Cell. 1994; 78: 787-798Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar), precipitated the histidinated (hence ubiquitinated) cellular proteins with Ni2+-agarose beads, and immunoblotted the precipitated proteins with anti-Grb10 antibodies. As can be seen in Fig. 5, we did not detect any ubiquitination of Grb10, despite relatively strong ubiquitination of the α subunit of the epithelial Na+channel (αrENaC) used as a positive control (25Staub O. Gautschi I. Ishikawa T. Breitschopf K. Ciechanover A. Schild L. Rotin D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6325-6336Crossref PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar). These results show that Grb10 is not ubiquitinated in vivo in exponentially growing R-/IR cells overexpressing Grb10. We repeated this experiment in p6/Grb10 cells and once again did not detect any ubiquitination of Grb10 (data not shown). To identify new interacting partners for Grb10, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screen of a mouse embryo library (19Vojtek A. Hollenberg S.M. Cooper J.A. Cell. 1993; 74: 205-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1660) Google Scholar) using mGrb10 as a bait, and identified Nedd4 (20Kumar S. Tomooka Y. Noda M. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Genomics. 1997; 40: 435-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) as a Grb10 interacting protein. We further showed that (i) the C2 domain (31Clark J.D. Lim L.L. Kriz R. Ramesha C.S.

(ii) A deletion of the mGrb10 C-terminal 148 amino acids, a region that includes the newly identified BPS domain (11He W. Rose D.W. Olefsky J.M. Gustafson T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6860-6867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) and the SH2 domain, abolishes the interaction with Nedd4. (iii) The SH2 domain alone of Grb10 shows the strongest interaction with Nedd4 but the BPS domain alone is also able to bind Nedd4. (iv) Grb10 and Nedd4 interact in vivo, as assessed by co-immunoprecipitation experiments. (v) The unphosphorylated Nedd4 preferentially co-immunoprecipitated with Grb10, and this interaction is Ca2+-independent. (vi) The interaction is constitutive and (vii) Grb10 is not ubiquitinated in vivo in mouse embryo fibroblasts over-expressing Grb10. Mouse Nedd4 (20Kumar S. Tomooka Y. Noda M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 185: 1155-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar) has been shown to be expressed in a variety of embryonic tissues and to localize in the cytoplasm (21Kumar S. Harvey K.F. Kinoshita M. Copeland N.G. Noda M. Jenkins N.A. Genomics. 1997; 40: 435-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Nedd4 is a ubiquitin protein ligase (E3) also containing 3 WW domains (in the mouse) (22Bork P. Sudol M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 531-533Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar) and a hect domain (24Huibregste J.M. Scheffner M. Beaudenon S. Howley P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2563-2567Crossref PubMed Scopus (700) Google Scholar). Not much is known on the biological role of mouse Nedd4: the WW domains of rat Nedd 4 have been shown to interact with the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC), recognizing proline-rich PY motifs (23Staub O. Dho S. Henry P.C. Correa J. Ishikawa T. McGlade J. Rotin D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2371-2380Crossref PubMed Scopus (739) Google Scholar), while the C2 domain is mediating Ca2+-dependent translocation to the plasma membrane (27Plant P.J. Yeger H. Staub O. Howard P. Rotin D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32329-32336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). C2 domains (31Clark J.D. Lim L.L. Kriz R. Ramesha C.S. Sultzman L.A. Lin A.Y.

Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 2375-2390Crossref PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar). Evidence is accumulating showing that some C2 domains can bind proteins as well (37Sudhof T.C. Rizo J.

Chem. 1996; 271: 24333-24336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar): the fact that Grb10 is interacting with Nedd4 in a Ca2+-independent manner is in agreement with increasing lines of evidence showing that some C2 domains which are Ca2+-regulated can bind other molecules in a Ca2+-independent manner (for a review, see Ref.32Rizo J. Sudhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15879-15882Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (707) Google Scholar). The interaction between Grb10 and Nedd4 in vivo is phosphotyrosine-independent, and is not influenced by mitogenic agents: our finding that an SH2 domain can bind a C2 domain in a phosphotyrosine-independent manner is novel and interesting, as it suggests an association which does not involve the binding pocket in the SH2 domain reserved for phosphotyrosine. Other phosphotyrosine-independent interactions with SH2 domains have already been reported in the literature (40Pendergast A.M. Muller A.J. Havlik M.H. Maru Y. Witte O.N.

How the SH2 domain of Grb10 binds the C2 domain of Nedd4 is unknown, and we cannot currently preclude the possibility of phospholipids involvement in this interaction, since the latter have been demonstrated to bind both SH2 and C2 domains (32Rizo J.

Cell. 1994; 79: 13-21Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1597) Google Scholar) and many lines of evidence are now accumulating on the role of the ubiquitin-proteasome system in regulating and degrading a number of cytosolic proteins, including cell cycle proteins (see for review, Ref. 46Deshaies R., J.

However, the molecular mechanisms by which presenilins regulate these processes remain unknown. With regard to the latter, we describe a molecular link between presenilins and the apoptotic pathway. Bcl-XL, an anti-apoptotic member of the Bcl-2 family was shown to interact with the carboxyl-terminal fragments of PS1 and PS2 by the yeast two-hybrid system. In vivo interaction analysis revealed that both PS2 and its naturally occurring carboxyl-terminal products, PS2short and PS2Ccas, associated with Bcl-XL, whereas the caspase-3-generated amino-terminal PS2Ncas fragment did not. This interaction was corroborated by demonstrating that Bcl-XL and PS2 partially co-localized to sites of the vesicular transport system. Functional analysis revealed that presenilins can influence mitochondrial-dependent apoptotic activities, such as cytochrome c release and Bax-mediated apoptosis.

At the amino acid level, these proteins are ∼67% identical and exhibit homology to two Caenorhabitis elegans gene products, SEL-12 and HOP1, both of which facilitate notch receptor-mediated signaling, thus suggesting a role for presenilins in this process (15Levitan D.

In addition to their roles in APP processing and notch receptor signaling, extensive evidence suggests presenilins involvement in programmed cell death (PCD) or apoptosis. ALG-3, a truncated mouse homologue of PS2, corresponding to the last 103 amino acids, rescues cells from T cell receptor-induced apoptosis by inhibiting Fas-meditated death signal (17Vito P.

Strikingly, physiological ALG-3-like counterparts have also been identified, exhibiting similar anti-apoptotic properties. For example, PS2Ccas, which represents a 119-amino acid carboxyl-terminal fragment of PS2 generated by caspase-3 cleavage (22Vito P. Ghayur T. D'Adamio L. J. Biol.

In addition, PS2short (PS2 s), a molecule generated either by alternative transcription or by proteolysis, exhibits similar anti-apoptotic property (22Vito P. Ghayur T. D'Adamio L. J. Biol.

To characterize better the molecular mechanisms by which presenilins and the apoptotic machinery are linked, we have tried to identify proteins interacting with both PS1 and PS2. Here we show that Bcl-XL, an anti-apoptotic member of the Bcl-2 family of protein (25Boise L.K. Gonzalez-Garcia M. Postema C.E. Ding L. Lindsten T. Turka L.A. Mao X. Núñez G. Thompson C.B. Cell. 1993; 74: 597-608Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2929) Google Scholar), associates with both PS1 and PS2. Moreover, we observed that presenilins can act upon the mitochondria by influencing cytochrome c release and by augmenting the proapoptotic effects of Bax, a Bcl-2 family member that opposes Bcl-XLfunction. Human kidney 293 T fibroblasts and COS-7 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's media supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Biofluids; Rockville MD) and glutamine (2 mm). The human Jurkat T-cell line was cultured in RPMI 1640 media containing 10% fetal calf serum (Biofluids), glutamine (2 mm), β-mercaptoethanol (25 nm), and the antibiotics streptomycin (10 μg/ml), penicillin (10 units/ml), and gentamicin (10 μg/ml) (Life Technologies, Inc.). Cells were cultured at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 humidifying chamber. Plasmids for the interactor trap were generously provided by Dr. Roger Brent (Harvard University, Boston), except for the pEG202-LexA-RFHM7.3, −12 baits, and pJG4–5-B42-Cdi3 prey control plasmids, which were kindly provided by Dr. R. F. Finley (Wayne State University, Detroit, MI). The pcDNA3-FLAG-Bcl-XL (Dr. G. Nunez, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI) and the pSFFV-Bax (Dr. S.

Chem. 1999; 274: 1533-1540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). PS1 and PS2 fragments were amplified by polymerase chain reaction and cloned into pcDNA3. Bcl-XL was cloned into the pEGFP-N1 construct (CLONTECH; Palo Alto, CA). The rabbit anti-human PS2n antibody was generated against the carboxyl-terminal region (a.a. 341–377) of the hydrophilic loop (22Vito P. Ghayur T. D'Adamio L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28315-28320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The 2972 polyclonal antibody (27Walter J. Capell A. Grünberg J. Pesold B. Schindzielorz A. Prio R.

The negative control mouse IgG and anti-human Bcl-XL monoclonal antibody (mAb) was purchased from Southern Biotechnology Inc. (Birmingham, AL). The carboxyl-terminal regions of PS1 (a.a. 264–467, PS1CT) and PS2 (a.a.330–448, PS2Ccas) were fused to the LexA DNA-binding domain in pEG202. Full-length Bcl-XL cDNA was cloned into the galactose-inducible pJG4-5 vector containing the B42-activation domain. The yeast two-hybrid system was performed as described previously (28Finley Jr., R. Brent R. DNA Cloning, Expression Systems: A Practical Approach. Oxford Universal Press, Oxford1995: 169-203Google Scholar). Briefly, the yeast strain RFY231 (MAT α trp1Δ::hisGhis3ura3–1 leu2::3 Lexop -LEU2) (29Kolonin M.G. Finley Jr., R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14266-14271Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) harboring either pEG202-LexA-PS1CT or -PS2Ccas and the lacZ reporter plasmid, pSH18–34, were transformed by the lithium acetate method with the pJG4–5-B42-Bcl-XL construct. Presenilin and Bcl-XL interactions were assayed for growth on the basis of leucine prototrophy on Gal Ura−His−Trp−Leu−plates. Subsequent testing for β-galactosidase activity was performed on Gal Ura−His−Trp− plates containing 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside. 2 × 105 293 T cells were transfected by the CaPO4method with 5 μg of each of the indicated constructs. Eight h post-transfection, cells were washed once in phosphate-buffered saline (Biofluids), plated in fresh media, and cultured overnight. Overexpressed proteins were cross-linked by resuspending cells in phosphate-buffered saline containing 10 mmdimethyl-3,3′-dithiobispropionimidate·2 HCl (Pierce) and incubated on ice for 40 min. Cells were washed and solubilized in 1% Nonidet P-40 (Calbiochem) lysing buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, and protease inhibitors including aprotinin (1%), leupeptin (1 mm), pepstatin (2 mm) (Sigma), and 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride) (2 mm) (ICN, Aurora, OH). After centrifugation (750 ×g; 30 min; 4 °C), cell lysates were rotated with bovine serum albumin-preabsorbed anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel (Sigma), for 1 h at room temperature. Protein-bound beads were extensively washed, and immunoabsorbed molecules were dissociated by the addition of Laemmli's sample buffer (30Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207227) Google Scholar) and resolved under reducing conditions (100 mm dithiothreitol) by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) (12%). Proteins were blotted onto nitrocellulose (Schleicher & Schuell) and probed with anti-PS2 antibodies, followed by an anti-rabbit IgG-horseradish peroxidase antibody (Promega, Madison, WI) and visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) (Pierce). 4 × 106 Jurkat cells (107/ml) were transfected by electroporation with the indicated plasmids. All transfections were normalized with pcDNA3 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Cells were allowed to recover by incubation for 1 h 30 min at 37 °C in a humidifying chamber. Cells were layered onto a Ficoll-Paque (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) cushion and centrifuged (750 × g; 20 min; 25 °C). The cell layer at the interface was removed, washed, and placed into culture. Cell samples were taken at various times, and nuclei were stained by the addition of an equal volume of a 2× hypotonic propidium iodide solution (50 μg/ml). Cell death was assessed by measuring the percentage of fragmented DNA by flow cytometry (31Nicoletti I. Migliorati G. Pagliacci M.C. Grignani F. Riccardi C. J. Immunol. Methods. 1991; 139: 271-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (4426) Google Scholar). For analysis of cytochrome release, 24–30 h after transfection, 293 cells were resuspended in 500 μl of buffer A (20 mmHepes, pH 7.5, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol) containing 250 mm sucrose and a mixture of protease inhibitors. Cells were homogenized with a glass Pyrex homogenizer; nuclei and unbroken cells were removed by centrifugation at 1,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The resulting supernatant was subjected to 10,000 × g centrifugation for 20 min at 4 °C, and the pellet fraction, containing the mitochondria, was washed in buffer A/sucrose and solubilized in TNC buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 8, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm CaCl2). The supernatant fraction was further centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C to generate cytosol. Equal amount of lysate (10 μg) from each fraction was separated by SDS-PAGE (10%) and blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes and subsequently probed with either anti-cytochrome c (PharMingen, San Diego, CA) or anti-cytochrome oxidase subunit IV mAb (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). COS-7 cells were plated at ∼40% confluence the day before transfection. Transfections were carried out using a total of 1 μg of DNA by the LipofectAMINE method (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were trypsinized and plated onto 15-mm round coverslips. Cells were fixed (2% paraformaldehyde), washed in phosphate-buffered saline, and incubated with the anti-PS2n antibody followed by a Texas Red-conjugated secondary antibody (Jackson Laboratories, West Grove, PA). Fluorescence analysis of GFP-tagged Bcl-XL and immunolabeled PS2 was performed on a Bio-Rad MRC1024 confocal microscope. cDNA corresponding to the capase-3-generated carboxyl-terminal fragment of PS2Ccas was fused to the LexA DNA-binding domain and used as “bait” in the yeast two-hybrid system. This carboxyl-terminal region, which includes a portion of the large hydrophilic loop, was chosen as bait because (i) it is cytoplasmically exposed and therefore likely to interact with other molecules, (ii) it exists as a physiological fragment generated by proteolysis, and (iii) it inhibits some forms of PCD. Sequence analysis of a specific interactor obtained from the yeast two-hybrid hunt prompted us to investigate whether Bcl-XL, a member of the Bcl-2 family (25Boise L.K. Gonzalez-Garcia M. Postema C.E. Ding L. Lindsten T. Turka L.A. Mao X. Núñez G. Thompson C.B. Cell. 1993; 74: 597-608Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2929) Google Scholar), interacts with PS2Ccas. TableI summarizes the results of the interaction between PS2Ccas and Bcl-XL. By day 3, as determined by both yeast growth and β-galactosidase activity, interaction between LexA-PS2Ccas and B42-Bcl-XL was undetected, whereas growth and β-galactosidase activity for two different positive controls (LexA-PS2Ccas and B42-cl.19; LexA-HM12 and B42-Cdi3) were observed. B42-cl.19 represents a novel molecule identified in the interactor trap, 2L. Pellegrini, B. Passer, and L. D'Adamio, unpublished observations. whereas the LexA-HM12 and B42-Cid3 interaction has been previously described (32Finley Jr., R.L. Brent R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12980-12984Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Interestingly, by day 6, growth was observed by yeast containing LexA-PS2Ccas and B42-Bcl-XL. Of importance, negative controls remained unchanged by this time. Taken together, this observation suggested the possibility that PS2 may interact with Bcl-XL.Table IYeast two-hybrid analysis reveals an interaction between PS2Ccas and Bcl-XLDay 3Day 6Cdi3Cl.19Bcl-xLCdi3Cl.19Bcl-XLβ-GalGrowthβ-GalGrowthβ-GalGrowthβ-GalGrowthβ-GalGrowthβ-GalGrowthPS2Ccas−−++−−−−++++RFHM 7.3−−−−−−−−−−−−RFHM 12++−−−−++−−−−RFY231 yeast containing pEG202 expressing the indicated LexA-tagged proteins and the lacZ reporter plasmid, pSH18–34, was transformed with pJG4–5 B42-tagged construct expressing either Cdi3, C1.19, or Bcl-XL. Yeast were streaked onto the appropriate selection plates (see “Materials and Methods”). Growth and β-galactosidase (β-Gal) activity was scored on days 3 and 6. Note that for PS2Ccas and Bcl-XL interactions, growth and β-galactosidase activity was not observed until day 6. LexA-HM7.3 and LexA-HM12 were used as negative control “baits,” whereas LexA-HM12 was used as a positive control with B42-Cdi3. Open table in a new tab RFY231 yeast containing pEG202 expressing the indicated LexA-tagged proteins and the lacZ reporter plasmid, pSH18–34, was transformed with pJG4–5 B42-tagged construct expressing either Cdi3, C1.19, or Bcl-XL.

LexA-HM7.3 and LexA-HM12 were used as negative control “baits,” whereas LexA-HM12 was used as a positive control with B42-Cdi3. To verify the interaction observed in yeast, we performed an in vivo interaction analysis. 293 T cells were transiently co-transfected with plasmids expressing either the negative control FLAG-AIP1 (26Vito P. Pellegrini L. Guiet C. D'Adamio L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1533-1540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar) or FLAG-Bcl-XL products in combination with either PS2Ccas or the amino-terminal product of caspase-3 cleavage, PS2Ncas. Western blot analysis of protein complexes, initially chemically cross-linked in vivo and immunoprecipitated with mouse anti-FLAG antibodies, revealed that PS2Ccas, but not PS2Ncas, was co-precipitated by FLAG-Bcl-XL. (Fig. 1, A and B, respectively). In contrast, the FLAG-AIP1 negative control did not precipitate either PS2Ccas or PS2Ncas. We then tested whether PS2 associated with Bcl-XL. PS2 typically runs as a prominent band of ∼50 kDa, consistent with its predicted size, in addition to a high molecular mass smear due to aggregation. As shown in Fig. 2, PS2 was detected in FLAG-Bcl-XL but not in FLAG-AIP1 immunocomplexes. Overexpression studies of PS2 have been previously shown to result in the generation of PS2s, a proteolytically derived product of ∼30 kDa (22Vito P. Ghayur T. D'Adamio L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28315-28320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 23Loetscher H. Deuschle U. Brockhaus M. Reinhardt D. Nelboeck P. Mous J. Grünberg J. Haass C.

As expected, a band migrating at ∼30 kDa was observed in total cell lysates overexpressing PS2. Moreover, this cleaved product was also detected in FLAG-Bcl-XL but not in FLAG-AIP1 immunoprecipitating conditions. The observation that FLAG-Bcl-XL associated with the proteolytically generated PS2 s fragment prompted us to assess further this interaction. In these experiments, plasmids expressing FLAG-Bcl-XL and untagged PS2s were co-transfected in 293 T cells and analyzed for interactions. Fig. 3 confirms a specific interaction between FLAG-Bcl-XL and PS2s. Overall, these results demonstrate that Bcl-XL binds both full-length and its natural occurring carboxyl-terminal fragments of PS2 but not the amino-terminal PS2Ncas product and, thus, maps the site of Bcl-XL interaction to the carboxyl terminus of PS2.Figure 3Bcl-XL co-immunoprecipitates PS2s with and without cross-linker.

To rule out the possibility that DTBP captures two molecules only in close proximity and not in an actual association, we tested Bcl-XL and PS2s interactions without DTBP. Fig. 3illustrates that FLAG-Bcl-XL readily precipitated PS2s in the absence of DTPB, as detected by the anti-PS2n antibody. Thus, these results argue against the possibility that these two molecules are only found in proximity and do not interact. Finally, we addressed whether endogenous PS2 could associate with Bcl-XL. Cell lysates derived from 293 T cells overexpressing Bcl-XL were incubated with either an isotype-matched IgG negative control (Fig. 4, lane 2) or the anti-Bcl-XL mAb (Fig. 4, lane 3) coupled to protein G-agarose. Immunoabsorbed material was analyzed for the presence of PS2 by Western blot using the anti-PS2n antibody. Fig.4 shows that the anti-Bcl-XLmAb immunoprecipitated a species of ∼50 kDa, which corresponds to the expected mass of full-length PS2. Verification of overexpressed Bcl-XL in total cell lysates is also shown (Fig. 4, lane 1). The above studies establish an in vivo interaction between Bcl-XL and presenilins. As a step toward validating the relevance of this association, co-localization studies were carried out. COS-7 cells were co-transfected with GFP-tagged Bcl-XLand untagged PS2 expression constructs, and 24 h after transfection, cells were analyzed by confocal microscopy. Single color analysis of PS2 (Texas Red; Fig. 5, left panel) and GFP-Bcl-XL (Fig. 5, right panel) co-transfectants revealed that the expressed proteins appeared similar in their localization patterns, reminiscent of the vesicular transport system (Fig. 5). Simultaneous dual color analysis (Fig. 5, middle panel) confirmed the partial co-localization (yellow) of Bcl-XL and PS2, possibly to the endoplasmic reticulum. PS1 is both structurally and functionally homologous to PS2. They display ∼67% homology at the amino acid level, exhibit similar membrane topologies, and are endoproteolytically processed in a similar fashion (23Loetscher H. Deuschle U. Brockhaus M.

PS1 and PS2 also participate in APP processing, notch receptor signaling, and PCD. Given these similarities, we investigated whether PS1 also associated with Bcl-XL in the yeast two-hybrid system. By using the carboxyl-terminal portion of PS1CT, which included the entire hydrophilic loop, we obtained results similar to those found with LexA-PS2Ccas. As compared with the positive control interaction of LexA-PS1CT and B42-cl.69, growth and β-galactosidase activity was delayed, not appearing until day 6 (TableII). B42-cl.69 was originally identified as a LexA-PS1CT interactor in a yeast two-hybrid screen 3B. Passer, L. Pellegrini, and L. D'Adamio, unpublished observations. ; however, for these studies, it was used as a positive control. Thus, like LexA-PS2Cas, LexA-PS1CT binds Bcl-XL.Table IIPS1CT and Bcl-XL interaction by the yeast two-hybrid systemDay 3Day 6Cdi3Cl.69Bcl-XLCdi3Cl.69Bcl-XLβ-GalGrowthβ-GalGrowthβ-GalGrowthβ-GalGrowthβ-GalGrowthβ-GalGrowthPS1CT−−++−−−−++++RFHM 7.3−−−−−−−−−−−−RFHM 12++−−−−++−−−−Yeast transformants harboring the indicated LexA expression plasmids together with the lacZ, reporter plasmid, pSH18–34, and either Cdi3, Cl.69, or Bcl-XL fused to the B42 activation domain were assayed for growth and β-galactosidase (β-Gal) activity.

The promoter activity of the SOD1 gene was increased 3–5-fold by hydrogen peroxide, paraquat (PQ) and heat shock. Functional analyses of the regulatory region of the SOD1 gene by deletions, mutations, and heterologous promoter systems confirmed the induction of the SOD1 gene by H2O2 through the hydrogen peroxide-responsive element (HRE) (between nucleotides −533 and −520). Gel mobility shift assays showed that the existence of an H2O2-inducible protein bound to the oligonucleotide of the HRE. Similar analyses showed that the heat shock activated the SOD1 promoter through the heat shock element (HSE) (between nucleotides −185 and −171). A strong specific far-shifted complex with the oligonucleotide of the HSE was observed by the treatment of heat shock. When cells were treated with PQ, a strong far-shifted complex with the HSE was observed and was competed out by the cold HSE probe, indicating that PQ also activated the SOD1 promoter through the same HSE site. It is very interesting to note that chemical and physical stresses, such as PQ and heat shock, respectively, activated the SOD1 promoter through the same cis-element HSE. These results indicate that the SOD1 was inducible by H2O2through the HRE and by PQ and heat shock through the same HSE to protect cells from oxidative hazards.

It catalyzes the dismutation of superoxide radicals (O⨪2) to oxygen and hydrogen peroxide (1Fridovich I. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1975; 44: 147-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (1573) Google Scholar). SOD not only prevents the Fenton reaction and DNA nicking in vitro but also protects against toxicity by H2O2 in vivo without O⨪2being directly involved in the generation of DNA damage (2Imlay J.A. Linn S Science. 1988; 240: 1302-1309Crossref PubMed Scopus (1648) Google Scholar). The production and/or removal of superoxides has been observed to play a significant role in a variety of critical homeostatic mechanisms both at the cellular and organismic levels. Because biological macromolecules are targets for the damaging action of abundant oxygen radicals, it is assumed that these increased superoxides should be initially eliminated by SOD. Therefore, the regulation and induction mechanism of the SOD1 gene would be of great interest (3Kim Y.H. Park K.H. Rho H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24539-24543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). It has also been reported that SOD1 could prevent oncogenesis and tumor promotion (4McCord J.M. Keele Jr., B.B. Fridovich I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1971; 68: 1024-1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (785) Google Scholar), reduce the cytotoxic and cardiotoxic effects of anticancer drugs (5Huber W. Menander K.B. Clin. Rheum. Dis. 1980; 6: 465-498Google Scholar), and protect against reperfusion damage of ischemic tissue (6Fridovich I. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1983; 23: 238-257Crossref Scopus (991) Google Scholar). A recent report suggested that overexpression of SOD1 and catalase could increase the average lifespan of the fly (7Orr W.C. Sohal R.S. Science. 1994; 263: 1128-1130Crossref PubMed Scopus (1257) Google Scholar). Lutropin, Ca2+, and reactive oxygen seemed to induce SOD1 in rats (8Laloraya M. Pradeep K.G. Laloraya M.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 157: 146-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 9Nicotera T.M. Notaro J. Notaro S. Schumer J. Sandberg A.A.

Stress conditions (i.e. oxidative stresses, heat shock, osmotic stress, and toxic metals) are deleterious to normal cellular function. To survive those environmental and physiological stresses, all organisms possess specific defense systems to protect themselves from various stresses. Aerobic organisms are continuously exposed to oxygen, which renders them prone to damage generated by oxygen-derived free radicals. Oxidative stress is largely mediated by reactive oxygen species, including superoxide anion (O⨪2), H2O2, and hydroxyl radical (OH⋅), which are intermediates of oxygen reduction generated by metal ion catalyzed redox reactions, metabolism of chemicals, and normal physiological activities, including respiration and inflammatory responses to infection (11Halliwell B. Gutteridge J.M.C. Biochem. J. 1984; 219: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (4535) Google Scholar). The free radicals generated by these mechanisms cause severe damage to critical cellular macromolecules, including nucleic acids, proteins, and lipids (12Halliwell B. Nutr. Rev. 1994; 52: 253-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar). Oxidative damage has been strongly correlated with aging and a number of diseases, including Parkinson's disease, Lou Gehrig's disease (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis), rheumatoid arthritis, and cancer (11Halliwell B. Gutteridge J.M.C. Biochem. J. 1984; 219: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (4535) Google Scholar, 13Brown J.R.H. Cell. 1995; 80: 687-692Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). Therefore, free radical levels must be carefully monitored under both physiological conditions and when generated by environmental stress. Cells employ a number of defense mechanisms to sense and respond appropriately to oxidative stress. Enzymes such as superoxide dismutases and catalases play critical roles in oxidative stress protection through catalyzing the conversion of reactive oxygen species to less harmful products (12Halliwell B. Nutr. Rev. 1994; 52: 253-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar, 14Beyer W. Imlay J. Fridovich I. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1991; 40: 221-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). As has been demonstrated in yeast, cells lacking a functional gene encoding SOD1 are highly sensitive to dioxygen and redox-cycling drugs, fail to grow on respiratory carbon sources, and exhibit increased spontaneous mutagenesis rates and a number of other phenotypes during aerobic growth (15Gralla E.B. Valentine J.S. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 5918-5920Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Free radical scavenging activities are also exacerbated by small antioxidant molecules, including glutathione, thioredoxin, and ascorbic acid (12Halliwell B. Nutr. Rev. 1994; 52: 253-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar). In addition to the prevention of oxidative damage, repair mechanisms are employed by cells to remove or repair damaged cellular components, including exo- and endonucleases for DNA damage repair, proteolytic enzymes for degradation of severely damaged proteins, and phospholipases glutathione peroxide/transferase/reductase for degradation and repair of damaged lipids (16Davies K.J.A. Wiese A.G. Sevanian A. Kim E.H. Molecular Biology of Aging. Alan R. Liss, New York1990: 123-141Google Scholar). Superoxide dismutase plays a key role in protection from the damage caused by oxygen radicals. The SOD1 expression is highly induced during environmental stresses. However, little is known about how the environmental signal is transmitted to a transcriptional regulator in cells during oxidative stress such as hydrogen peroxide, paraquat (PQ) and heat shock. In this study, the induction of the SOD1 gene by hydrogen peroxide, PQ, and heat shock was investigated by the transfection of CAT expression vectors containing the rat SOD1 promoter. The deletion, mutation, and heterologous promoter systems were used to identify cis-elements that respond to hydrogen peroxide, PQ, and heat shock for minimizing hazardous effects. A specific interaction of the hydrogen peroxide-responsive element (HRE) binding protein and heat shock element (HSE) binding protein (heat shock factor) was also investigated by gel mobility shift assays. The results demonstrated that the SOD1 was inducible by H2O2through the HRE and by PQ and heat shock through the same HSE to protect cells from oxidative hazards. The plasmids, containing the upstream region of the rat SOD1 gene (17Kim Y.H. Yoo H.Y. Jung G. Kim J. Rho H.M. Gene (Amst.). 1993; 133: 267-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) and the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase structural gene (CAT), were constructed as described previously (3Kim Y.H. Park K.H. Rho H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24539-24543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). For the construction of pHREtk and pHSEtk, the oligonucleotide of the HRE (between nucleotides −533 and −520) and HSE (between nucleotides −185 and −171) sequence of the SOD1 promoter was cloned into the Bam HI site of pBLCAT2Δ, which is derived from pBLCAT2. The plasmid pBLCAT2Δ has a minimal region (−80 to +51) of the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase promoter (18Luckow B. Schütz G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 5490Crossref PubMed Scopus (1401) Google Scholar). Three copies of the HRE and HSE oligonucleotides were introduced. The plasmid pmHREtk and pmHSEtk are mutants of pHREtk and pHSEtk with three copies of the mutated site. Their sequences are as follows: SOD-HRE, 5′-GATCGGCTTGCCTAGGAAGCGCAAGG-3′/3′-CCGAACGGATCCTTCGCGTTCCCTAG-5′; SOD-mHRE, 5′-GATCGGCTTGCCTACTCTTAGCAAGG-3′/3′-CCGAACGGATGAGAATCGTTCCCTAG-5′; SOD-HSE, 5′-GATCTCGATTCTGGAACTTTCTCAG-3′/3′-AGCTAAGACCTTGAAAGAGTCCTAG-5′; SOD-mHSE, 5′-GATCTCGAGGATGTCCCTGGATCAG-3′/3′-AGCTCCTACAGGGACCTAGTCCTAG-5′. The inser- tion of the HRE and HSE consensus and mutant sequences was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Human HepG2 hepatoma cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/10% fetal calf serum/penicillin G sodium at 100 units/ml/streptomycin sulfate at 100 μg/ml/amphotericin B at 250 ng/ml. Cells were seeded into 60-mm plastic culture dishes (30–50% confluence) for 24 h prior to transfection. An equal amount (3.0 pmol) of the various constructs was transfected to the cells by the calcium phosphate DNA coprecipitation method (19Chen C. Okayama H. BioTechniques. 1988; 6: 632-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). 5 μg of pRSVβ-gal plasmid (20Edlund T. Walker M.D. Barri P.J Rutter W.J. Science. 1985; 230: 912-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar) was introduced in all experiments to correct the variations of transfection efficiency. Chemicals were added to and heat shock treatment was carried out on the culture medium at 36 h after transfection, and the cells were maintained for appropriate times. The various chemicals were evaluated for cytotoxicity over a concentration range of 1–500 μm by monitoring cell death. Nuclear extracts were prepared by a modified procedure of Andrews and Faller (21Andrews N.C. Faller D.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 2499Crossref PubMed Scopus (2210) Google Scholar). The CAT assay was performed as described previously (22Kim Y.H. Yoo H.Y. Chang M.S. Jung G. Rho H.M. FEBS Lett. 1997; 401: 267-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The transfected cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and harvested. The pelleted cells were resuspended in 100 μl of 0.25 m Tris-Cl (pH 7.9) and lysed by three cycles of freezing and thawing. After removing cell debris by centrifugation, cell extracts were first assayed for β-galactosidase activity (23Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Equal quantities of proteins were assayed for CAT activity on the basis of β-galactosidase activity. Extracts were incubated with 0.025 μCi of [14C]chloramphenicol, 0.25 m Tris-Cl (pH 7.6), 0.4 mm acetyl coenzyme A for 1 h at 37 °C. The enzyme assay was terminated by adding ethyl acetate. The organic layer was analyzed by TLC with chloroform/methanol (95:5). After autoradiography, both acetylated and unacetylated forms of [14C]chloramphenicol were scraped from the plate, and the conversion of chloramphenicol to acetylated form was calculated by measuring radioactivities. The relative CAT activities were calculated from the percentage conversion. Results are the average of three independent experiments. The oligonucleotides for the HRE and HSE sites were synthesized and labeled with [γ-32P]ATP and polynucleotide kinase (23Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). An equal amount (10 μg) of nuclear extract from each sample was mixed with labeled oligonucleotide for 20 min at 20 °C in a 15-μl solution containing 10 mmHEPES, 100 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, and 2 μg of poly(dI-dC). The binding reaction mixtures were electrophoresed in 6% acrylamide gels in 0.5× TBE (44 mmTris, 44 mm boric acid, and 1 mm EDTA). After electrophoresis, the gels were dried and exposed to x-ray film. For competition assays, a binding reaction was performed with an excess of cold probe or competitor DNA. In the supershift assay, the specific polyclonal antibody against Elk1 (Santa Cruz Biotech. Inc) was added to the reaction mixture after the binding reaction. SOD1 is one of the major cellular defense enzymes protecting cells against oxidative stress. It was hypothesized that hydrogen peroxide, PQ, and heat shock are involved in the activation of the SOD1 promoter. H2O2 was used as a membrane-permeable reagent, which allows studies of the effects of oxygen radicals in living cells. If hydrogen peroxide is inefficiently removed or if an excess is present, it can react with superoxide to generate the highly toxic hydroxyl radical. PQ is a redox-active compound that is photoreduced and subsequently reoxidized by transfer of its electrons to oxygen, generating superoxide (O⨪2). HepG2 cells were transfected with plasmid pRSP-1633, containing the rat SOD1 upstream region fused to the bacterial CAT. 36 h after transfection, hydrogen peroxide, PQ, and heat shock were separately applied to the transfected cells. The transfected cells were incubated in the presence of 200 μmH2O2, 50 μm PQ and at a temperature of 42 °C, respectively. After 2 h, the CAT activity of each transfected cell was determined (Fig.1 B). These treatments increased the expression of the SOD1 promoter about 3-fold. H2O2 and PQ at concentrations of up to 300 and 100 μm, respectively, did not affect cell viability. As shown in Fig. 2, the time-dependent activation of the SOD1 promoter by H2O2, PQ, and heat shock was observed. The level of CAT activity reached a maximum at 2 h when the cells transfected with pRSP-576 were treated with H2O2. Maximum activity appeared at 1 h with the treatment of PQ and heat shock. It may be possible that the peak of SOD1 activation occurred earlier than 1 h. When the cells transfected with pRSP-576 were treated with H2O2, a 3-fold induction of CAT activity was observed. No induction was observed in cells bearing the plasmid pRSP-412 (Fig. 3 C). These results mean that the activation of the SOD1 gene by H2O2 may be due to the existence of DNA elements between −576 and −412. The induction by PQ was observed in both transfection experiments with pRSP-576 and pRSP-412 (data not shown). It seems that the cis-element corresponding to induction by PQ was located downstream of −412 of the SOD1 gene. When the SOD-CAT construct (pRSP-305) was transiently expressed in HepG2 cells, 4- and 3-fold induction of CAT activity by heat shock (42 °C) and PQ was observed, respectively (Fig. 3 D). No induction was observed in cells bearing the plasmid pRSP-55 (Fig.3 D). These results mean that the activation of the SOD1 promoter by heat shock and PQ may be due to the existence of DNA elements between −305 and −56.Figure 2Time-dependent activation of the SOD1 promoter by H2O2, PQ, and heat shock. Cells transfected with pRSP-576 were treated with H2O2 (A), PQ (B), and heat shock (HS; C) for 0–4 h, and then CAT assays were carried out. The results are the means of three experiments.

The transfected cells were treated with factors in the same conditions as Fig.1 B. The numbers in the names of plasmids represent the deletion points of SOD1 5′-flanking sequence.

However, the induction with PQ was observed in both cases (data not shown). These results might suggest that H2O2 and PQ regulate the SOD1 gene by different regulatory elements and factors. The region between −576 and −413 was previously identified as a positive regulatory element (PRE) (24Chang M.S. Yoo H.Y. Rho H.M. Biochem. J. 1999; 339: 335-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). As an initial trial to identify the transcriptional enhancer element that was involved in H2O2 induction of the SOD1 gene, transient assays using CAT constructs were carried out. The plasmid pPREtk, which has the PRE linked to a herpes simplex virus-thymidine kinase promoter connected to the CAT gene, and pRSP-576 as a positive control were introduced into HepG2 cells, and the cells were treated with H2O2 for 2 h. The CAT activity was measured, and typical results are shown in Fig.4 B. The results clearly indicate that the CAT activity of pPREtk increased about 5-fold with H2O2. The PRE was thought to be a major target for H2O2 stimuli to induce the SOD1 gene. From the sequence analysis of transcription factor binding sites in the PRE, the sequence of Elk1, which is the serum response factor accessory protein (25Treisman R. Marais R. Wynne J. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4632-4640Crossref Scopus (137) Google Scholar), was located between −533 and −520 of the SOD1 gene (24Chang M.S. Yoo H.Y. Rho H.M. Biochem. J. 1999; 339: 335-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Induction by H2O2 of c-fos and possibly other early response genes was mediated through the activation of the serum response element for the binding site of serum response factor (26Nose K. Shibanuma M. Kikuchi K. Kageyama H. Sakiyama S. Kuroki T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 201: 99-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). The −533 to −520 sequence named as the HRE was tested for induction ability by H2O2. Double-stranded oligonucleotide containing the HRE sequence was inserted upstream of the thymidine kinase promoter connected to the CAT gene (Fig.5 A). CAT activity was induced by H2O2 in cells transfected with pHREtk by 3-fold, but CAT activity was not induced by H2O2 when pmHREtk containing a mutated HRE site was transfected (Fig. 5 C). These results confirmed that the HRE is responsible for the activation of the SOD1 promoter by H2O2.Figure 5Transcriptional activation of the SOD1 promoter by H2O2, heat shock, and PQ through HRE and HSE.

Relative CAT activity is expressed as compared with CAT activity obtained in untreated cells.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The activation of the SOD1 gene by heat shock and PQ was due to the DNA sequences between −305 and −56 (Fig.3 D). From the sequence analysis of transcription factor binding sites in this region, the heat shock element (NGAAN) (27Xiao H. Lis J.T. Science. 1988; 239: 1139-1142Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar), was found to be located between −185 and −171 of the SOD1 gene (Fig. 1 A). Heat shock treatment of murine macrophage resulted in an enhanced capacity to release superoxide anion (O⨪2) (28Reddy M.V. Gangadharam P.R. Infect. Immun. 1992; 60: 2386-2390Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Also, Omar and Pappolla (29Omar R. Pappolla M. Eur. Arch. Psychiatry Clin. Neurosci. 1993; 242: 262-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) showed that heat shock protein synthesis was induced by high levels of superoxide anion. Therefore, it was assumed that the activation of the SOD1 promoter by heat shock and PQ may be mediated through the heat shock element. To confirm this possibility, the heat shock element was synthesized and ligated to the herpes simplex virus minimal thymidine kinase promoter proximal to the CAT gene (Fig. 5 B). The CAT activity of this construct was analyzed after exposure of cells to either heat shock or PQ (Fig. 5 D). When pHSEtk was transfected into HepG2 cells, CAT activity was induced by heat shock or PQ by about a 5-fold. But the CAT activity was not induced by heat shock or PQ when pmHSEtk containing the mutated HSE site was transfected. These findings indicate that the HSE is sufficient to confer the PQ response and that this inducibility is mediated by HSF. These results establish that the HSF play some kind of role in eukaryotic oxidative stress protection and suggest that heat and oxidative stress signals communicate with the HSF to activate gene transcription. To determine the nuclear factors that interact with the HRE sequence, gel mobility shift assays were carried out by using a double-stranded oligonucleotide corresponding to HRE as a probe (Fig. 6). When a nuclear extract prepared from HepG2 cultures was incubated with a32P-labeled SOD1 HRE probe, one prominent DNA-protein complex was observed. An HRE oligonucleotide-protein complex disappeared when unlabeled oligonucleotide (50×, 100×) was added to the reaction mixture (Fig. 6 A, lanes 3 and 4). The formation of the protein-DNA complex was not inhibited with a mutated HRE oligonucleotide, indicating the specificity of this protein-DNA interaction. The binding of Elk1 to the HRE was further confirmed by the result that the protein-DNA complex was supershifted by the addition of the anti-Elk1 antibody (Fig.6 A, lane 6). These results imply that Elk1 is the binding protein of HRE. When nuclear proteins prepared from the H2O2-treated HepG2 cells (2 h) were used, the intensity of the specific complex increased (Fig. 6 B). The binding activity of the HRE-binding factor was also investigated in the cell-free system (Fig. 6 C). Nuclear extract prepared from nontreated HepG2 cells was incubated with H2O2(200 μm) to examine the variation of its binding activity to the HRE site. The incubation of the nuclear extract with H2O2 resulted in increasing the intensity of the retarded complex (Fig. 6 C, lane 3) and disappearance by competition with the cold probe (Fig. 6 C, lane 4). Because the intensity of the specific HRE-protein complex was increased by H2O2 treatment in the cell-free system (Fig. 6 C, lane 3), it was also assumed that hydrogen peroxide treatment increased the binding activity of the HRE binding protein. Gel mobility shift assays were used to detect sequence-specific binding of factors to the SOD1 HSE sequence in extracts from HepG2 cells. Nuclear extracts were prepared from cells that had been heat treated at 42 °C for 1 h or maintained at the control temperature of 37 °C. These extracts were incubated with a 5′ end-labeled oligonucleotide containing an HSE sequence (between sequence −185 and −171 of the SOD1 gene). In reactions with extracts from the control cells, two sets of retarded bands were observed (Fig. 7). Bands produced by sequence-specific factor binding were identified by competition assays with unlabeled DNA fragments. Unlabeled HSE fragments competed efficiently with the formation of a faster-migrating protein-DNA complex (Fig. 7, lanes 3 and 4). No such competition was observed with the mHSE oligonucleotide (Fig. 7, lane 5). The formation of the more slowly migrating complex was not in competition with the HSE fragment. Thus, the latter complexes did not result from sequence-specific factor binding to the HSE sequences. When nuclear proteins prepared from the heat-treated cells were used, a strong specific far-shifted complex was observed. This strong new complex disappeared by self-competition (Fig. 7, lanes 9 and 10). The HSF in eukaryotes acquires high affinity DNA binding activity upon heat shock activation by conversion from a monomer to homotrimer (30Westwood J.T. Wu C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3481-3486Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Therefore, the new far-shifted complex may be a homotrimer HSF-DNA complex. Analogous results were obtained from experiments with nuclear extracts from cells treated with PQ for 1 h (Fig.8 A). A far-shifted complex disappeared by self-competition, demonstrating a specific interaction (Fig. 8 A, lane 5). These results indicate that the SOD1 gene protects cells from PQ toxicity in an HSF-dependent manner and that heat and oxidative stress signals communicate with HSF to activate gene transcription. The far-shifted protein complex disappeared after reequilibration to 37 °C for 1 h following a heat shock (Fig. 8 B, lane 4). These results also showed that the transcription of the SOD1 gene is induced by heat shock through the same binding of the HSF to the HSE site.Figure 8The change of binding of HSE binding protein (HSF) by PQ and heat shock. A, a gel mobility shift assay was performed using nuclear extracts prepared from untreated and PQ-treated HepG2 cells. The DNA-protein complex disappeared by cold competitor (lane 3). When nuclear extracts from the cells treated with PQ (50 μm) for 1 h were used, a far-shifted band appeared (lane 4). B, the induction of a far-shifted band by heat shock in vitro. The +/− represents that reequilibration to 37 °C following a heat shock (42 °C).

To analyze the target of transcriptional activation of the SOD1 gene, CAT plasmids were constructed that contain these elements in the upstream region of the thymidine kinase promoter. From these results, it was shown that the HRE sequence is one of the targets of transcriptional activation by H2O2. Also, we have found that superoxides could activate the SOD1 gene. Because the steady state concentration of H2O2 in the cell is so low (1 × 10−8m) and specific enzymes (i.e. catalase, glutathione peroxidase, and myeloperoxidase) actively convert H2O2 to H2O in a fast speed, the resulting hydrogen peroxide by SOD1 is thought not to activate the SOD1 gene by the positive feedback mechanism. In this experiment, the promoter activation was observed at the concentration around 100 μm of H2O2. Active oxygens are suggested to be involved in inflammatory responses; the activations by H2O2 of c-fos, c-jun, and egr-1, which activate the expression of cellular genes, are probably essential for these responses. DNA damaging agents have been reported to activate c-fos and AP1-inducible genes such as those for collagenase and metallothionein (31Angel P. Ponting A. Mallick U. Rahmsdorf H. Schorpp M. Herrlich P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 1760-1766Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Active oxygens such as O⨪2 or H2O2 are produced in mitochondria during oxidative electron transport and in the endoplasmic reticulum, peroxisomes, and nuclear and plasma membranes. The active oxygens generated in these locations may regulate certain cellular genes by inducing early response genes. To mount an appropriate oxidative stress defense, cells must harbor oxidative stress sensors. A number of antioxidant responses in bacteria have been elegantly studied, and it has been established that reactive oxygen species are directly sensed by key regulatory molecules that activate the expression of genes encoding antioxidant proteins at the level of transcription (32Demple B. Amabile-Cuevas C.F. Cell. 1991; 67: 837-839Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 33Farr S.B. Kogoma T. Microbiol. Rev. 1991; 55: 561-585Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34Storz G. Tartaglia L.A. Ames B.N. Science. 1990; 248: 189-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar). Distinct defense mechanisms are involved in H2O2 and O⨪2 detoxification in Escherichia coli through the OxyR and SoxRS regulons, respectively. OxyR directly senses oxidative stress to activate the expression of H2O2-inducible genes, including those encoding catalase and alkyl hydroperoxide reductase (34Storz G. Tartaglia L.A. Ames B.N. Science. 1990; 248: 189-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar). The SoxRS regulon is controlled in a two-stage process. First an iron-sulfur protein, SoxR, is activated by increases in intracellular superoxide anion levels and triggers transcription of the soxS gene. The SoxS protein in turn induces transcription of other genes of the regulon, including those encoding manganese superoxide dismutase, the DNA repair endonuclease IV, and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenese (32Demple B. Amabile-Cuevas C.F. Cell. 1991; 67: 837-839Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar,33Farr S.B. Kogoma T. Microbiol. Rev. 1991; 55: 561-585Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 35Wu J. Weiss B. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 3915-3920Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The oxidative stress response and its relationship to heat shock phenomena are also being intensely investigated in eukaryotic systems. Unlike the bacterial systems described earlier, little is known about how eukaryotic cells co-ordinate gene expression in response to oxidative stress (34Storz G. Tartaglia L.A. Ames B.N. Science. 1990; 248: 189-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar). Heat shock proteins are known to protect cells from thermal and oxidative injuries as well as other types of injuries (36Lindquist S. Craig E.A. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1988; 22: 631-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (4383) Google Scholar). In this study, we have found that the paraquat, O⨪2-generating agent, could activate the SOD1 gene through the heat shock element. Heat shock may cause activation of the membrane-associated oxidase system directly or indirectly through HSP, resulting in increased O⨪2 production. Oxygen free radicals induce heat shock protein synthesis in cultured human neuroblastoma cells (29Omar R. Pappolla M. Eur. Arch. Psychiatry Clin. Neurosci. 1993; 242: 262-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). These findings suggest a common mechanism by which various forms of injury, such as hyperthermis, cause HSP induction, that is, via oxidative stress or increased production of oxygen free radicals. The results presented in this study showed that the rat SOD1 gene was inducible by hydrogen peroxide, paraquat, and heat shock. It was shown that the HRE sequence is one of the targets of transcriptional activation by H2O2. Also, it was found that paraquat and heat shock induced the SOD1 gene through the HSE. These results establish that heat and PQ are communicated to HSF to activate gene transcription. The SOD1 enzyme could function as an inducible protective response against oxidative stresses. The SOD1 gene was induced by nontoxic ginsenoside Rb2 through the AP-2 site (3Kim Y.H. Park K.H. Rho H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24539-24543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The diversity of SOD1 inducers implies that there are multiple regulatory elements for the proper adjustment to various conditions."

The type IIα isoform of protein kinase A (PKA) is induced late in spermatogenesis and is thought to localize PKA to the flagellar apparatus where it binds cAMP and stimulates motility. A targeted disruption of the type IIα regulatory subunit (RIIα) gene allowed us to examine the role of PKA localization in sperm motility and fertility. In wild type sperm, PKA is found primarily in the detergent-resistant particulate fraction and localizes to the mitochondrial-containing midpiece and the principal piece. In mutant sperm, there is a compensatory increase in RIα protein and a dramatic relocalization of PKA such that the majority of the holoenzyme now appears in the soluble fraction and colocalizes with the cytoplasmic droplet. Unexpectedly the RIIα mutant mice are fertile and have no significant changes in sperm motility.

Hum, Reprod. 1993; 8: 1786-1791Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that elevated cAMP stimulates the phosphorylation of sperm proteins by protein kinase A (PKA)1 leading to increased motility (2Brandt H. Hoskins D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 982-987Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Tash J.S. Means A.R. Biol. Reprod. 1983; 28: 75-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar, 6Ishiguro K. Murofushi H.

In support of this, PKA activity has been shown to rise during capacitation of motile sperm (8Visconti P.E. Johnson L.R. Oyaskim M. Fornes M. Moss S.B. Gerton G.L. Kopf G.S. Dev. Biol. 1997; 192: 351-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). However, other targets for cAMP action are possible. Cyclic nucleotide-gated ion channels are found along the flagellum of mammalian sperm (9Weyand I. Godde M. Frings S. Weiner J. Muller F. Altenhofen W. Hatt H. Kaupp U.B. Nature. 1994; 368: 859-863Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 10Weisner B. Weiner J. Middendorff R. Hagen V. Kaupp U.B. Weyand I. J.

Either cyclic nucleotide-gated ion channels or cAMP-regulated guanine nucleotide exchange factors could conceivably mediate the stimulation of sperm motility by increases in cAMP levels. In sperm, cAMP levels are elevated when adenylyl cyclase is activated by bicarbonate (12Okamura N. Tajima Y. Soejima A. Masuda H. Sugita Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 9699-9705Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Garty N.B. Salomon Y. FEBS Lett. 1987; 218: 148-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 14Visconti P.E.

The activation of the PKA holoenzyme occurs when cAMP binds to the regulatory subunit of PKA and causes the dissociation of the catalytic (C) subunit. The PKA holoenzyme is designated either type I or type II, depending on whether it contains RI or RII, and in mammalian sperm, both are expressed. In mouse postmeiotic spermatids RII predominates (17Conti M. Adamo S. Geremia R. Monesi V. Biol. Reprod. 1983; 28: 860-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), with RIIα mRNA and protein being highly expressed in mature elongating spermatids (18Landmark B.F. Oyen O. Skalhegg B.S.

Reprod. 1990; 43: 46-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Greater than 50% of the RII holoenzyme remains in the detergent-resistant tail fraction of mature sperm, suggesting that the majority of the RII holoenzyme is firmly attached to the flagellum (20Horowitz J.A. Toeg H. Orr G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 832-838Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although conflicting data exist on whether the RIIα subunit is present in the epididymal sperm head, both RIIα and C subunits are abundant in the midpiece and principal piece of the flagellum (21Pariset C.

Reprod. 1997; 57: 1517-1523Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). These results suggest that type II PKA is the primary isoform of PKA in mature sperm and that it is tightly anchored to the particulate fraction of the sperm flagellum. Recently it was found that PKA anchoring proteins (AKAPs) bind RII subunits with high affinity and that AKAPs also bind other signaling molecules such as calcineurin and protein kinase C (24Lester L.B. Scott J.D. Rec. Prog. Horm. Res. 1997; 52: 409-430PubMed Google Scholar). Multi-enzyme complexes tethered by AKAPs may position protein kinases and phosphatases near their organelle-bound substrates to promote the rapid and selective phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of target proteins. Several AKAPs have been characterized in mouse sperm including S-AKAP84 (also identified as d-AKAP1), which has been localized to the mitochondria of immature sperm but is lost during maturation (25Lin R.-Y. Moss S.B. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27804-27811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar), and AKAP82, which has been localized to the fibrous sheath of mature sperm in mouse (26Carrera A. Gerton G.L. Moss S.B. Dev. Biol. 1994; 165: 272-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Recently, both S-AKAP84/d-AKAP1 and AKAP82 (also identified as the fibrous sheath component 1 (FSC1)) were shown to bind the RIα subunit in addition to RII subunits (27Huang L.J. Durick K. Weiner J.A. Chun J. Taylor S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8057-8064Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar, 28Miki K. Eddy E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34384-34390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The binding affinity of S-AKAP84/d-AKAP1 for RIIα is nearly 25-fold greater than for RIα (27Huang L.J. Durick K. Weiner J.A. Chun J. Taylor S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8057-8064Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar), suggesting that S-AKAP84/d-AKAP1 preferentially binds RII in cells expressing both RII and RI. In contrast, a region in AKAP82/FSC1 (domain B) was observed to bind RIα exclusively (28Miki K. Eddy E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34384-34390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), suggesting that in sperm, RIIα is bound to S-AKAP84/d-AKAP1 and AKAP82/FSC1, and RIα is bound to AKAP82/FSC1. By using a synthetic peptide that mimics the amphipathic helix RII binding motif in AKAPs (29Carr D.W. Stofko-Hahn R.E. Fraser I.D. Bishop S.M. Acott T.S. Brennan R.G. Scott J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14188-14192Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the association between RII subunits and AKAPs can be disrupted (30Carr D.W. Hausken Z.E. Fraser I.D. Stofko-Hahn R.E. Scott J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13376-13382Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This synthetic peptide also blocks motility of bovine sperm (31Vijayarghavan S. Goueli S.A. Davey M.P. Carr D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4747-4752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Together these findings have led to the proposal that PKA is anchored to AKAPs by RIIα in the flagellum and that this interaction is required for sperm motility. Based upon these findings we hypothesized that gene-targeted disruption of the RIIα subunit of PKA would produce infertile male mice as a consequence of having sperm with compromised motility. However, unexpectedly the RIIα-deficient male mice are fertile, and both the curvilinear velocity and percent motility of mutant sperm are not significantly different from that of wild type sperm. Furthermore, we show that a compensatory increase in RIα protein in mutant sperm correlates with a change in the fractionation and localization of PKA such that the majority of the holoenzyme is now found in the soluble fraction and cytoplasmic droplet. We conclude from these studies that anchored PKA is not essential for sperm motility. Wild type and RIIα mutant males were generated as described previously (32Burton K.A. Johnson B.D. Hausken Z.E. Westenbroek R.E. Idzerda R.L. Scheuer T. Scott J.D. Catterall W.A. McKnight G.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11067-11072Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Animals used in this study were 75, 87.5, or 97% C57BL/6 with the remaining genetic background as 129 Sv/J. Female C57BL/6 mice used in this study were purchased from Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME). The cauda epididymides from adult wild type and mutant mice were removed, minced, and placed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Sperm were allowed to swim out for 20 min at 37 °C. The sperm suspension was diluted in sample buffer to a final concentration of 63 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 2% sodium dodecyl sulfate, 5% glycerol, and 0.05% bromphenol blue and sonicated. DNA concentration was determined using Hoescht dye fluorescence and was used to adjust for equal sample loading on 10% polyacrylamide gels. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. These blots were blocked overnight with 5% bovine serum albumin and 0.1% Tween 20 and then probed with affinity purified polyclonal antibodies to RIα, Cα, RIIα, or RIIβ. After washing and incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody, immunoreactivity was visualized with the Amersham Pharmacia Biotech ECLTM system. Cauda epididymal sperm were allowed to swim out in buffer A, which contained 12 mmKH2PO4, 58.5 mm NaCl, 4.8 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm glucose, and 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4. Volumes were adjusted to provide equal concentrations (determined with a hemacytometer) of sperm from wild type and mutant mice. After gentle washing in 5 ml of cold 0.1 m PBS, cells were collected (600 × g for 10 min) and resuspended in buffer A containing protease inhibitors and 1% Triton X-100. The sperm were then frozen/thawed three times in liquid nitrogen and placed on ice for 30 min. These extracts were clarified (40,000 × g for 15 min), and the supernatant was taken as the soluble fraction. The pellet was washed once by dispersal and sedimentation as above and then resuspended in the same volume of fortified buffer A as used for the supernatant fraction (above). Equal volumes of these fractions from wild type and mutant sperm were loaded on 10% polyacrylamide gels, and PKA subunits were visualized as described above by Western blot. Sperm were recovered from the cauda epididymides as described above using PBS. Sperm were allowed to settle and attach on glass slides for 30 min then fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and 0.05% gluteraldehyde in phosphate buffer overnight at 4 °C. Fixed sperm were washed and then blocked in 5% nonfat milk in PBS for 1 h at room temperature. Incubation with primary antibody diluted in 2% nonfat milk in PBS proceeded for 1.5 h at room temperature and then by 24 h at 4 °C. The polyclonal antibodies to RIIα and Cα were affinity purified and used at concentrations of 1:500 and 1:2000, respectively. A monoclonal antibody to RIα (Transduction Laboratories) was used at a concentration of 10 μg/ml. Samples were washed, probed with a biotinylated secondary antibody, washed again, and then probed with avidin-fluorescein (1 h at 37 °C). After a final wash, a coverslip was mounted with Vectashield (Vector Labs, Inc.). Samples were viewed and photographed on a Nikon Microphot-FXA microscope. Controls used to determine the level of nonspecific staining were subjected to the treatments described above but in the absence of primary antibody. Minimal staining was observed in these controls. Cytoplasmic droplets were separated from sperm following a previously described protocol (33Garbers D.L. Wakabayashi T. Reed P.W. Biol. Reprod. 1970; 3: 327-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Briefly, cauda epididymal sperm were layered on a discontinuous sucrose gradient composed of 1.5 ml of 1.0 m sucrose plus 1.0 ml of 0.25m sucrose in PBS and then sedimented (1500 ×g for 20 min). Cytoplasmic droplets were collected as a band in the 0.25 m sucrose layer while avoiding the 0.25m/1.0 m interface and were subsequently centrifuged for 20 min at 27,000 × g. Sperm and cytoplasmic droplet pellets were initially resuspended in PBS (100 μl) and examined under the light microscope to determine the presence of sperm and droplets in each layer. Few sperm were detected in the cytoplasmic droplet pellet, but droplets were still observed attached to sperm in the sperm pellet. Both the sperm suspension and the cytoplasmic droplet suspension were then mixed with sample buffer (as described in Western analysis) to the same final volume. DNA quantification and Western analysis (as described above) were then performed on the samples. There was no detectable DNA in the cytoplasmic droplet sample. Equal amounts of sperm (as estimated by the DNA concentration) were loaded for wild type and mutant sperm samples. Equivalent volumes of cytoplasmic droplet and sperm samples were loaded. Males that were 6–8 months of age were used for this study. Two different protocols were used. The first used medium that supports capacitation and contains NaHCO3 (25 mm), Ca2+ (1 mm), and bovine serum albumin (Fraction V, Sigma; 20 mg/ml) (34Neill J.M. Olds-Clarke P. Gamete Res. 1987; 18: 121-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 35Visconti P.E. Bailey J.L. Moore G.D. Dieyun P. Olds-Clarke P. Kopf G.S. Development. 1995; 121: 1129-1137Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The motility of cauda epididymal sperm from males with proven fertility was assessed after 2 h of incubation in this medium. The other protocol examined the effects of cAMP analogues and used a medium that contained 135 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mmMgSO4, 2 mm CaCl2, 10 mm lactic acid, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 30 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, and 20 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. After a 5-h incubation and a further 30 min in the presence or absence of either 1 mm Sp-cAMP or 1 mm Rp-cAMP (Research Biochemicals Inc.), sperm motility was examined. For both protocols, quantitative sperm motility analysis on videotaped sperm samples was done by using an automated Hamilton-Thorn Motility analyzer as described (36Olds-Clarke P. Johnson L.R. Dev. Biol. 1993; 155: 14-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). A slide chamber of 50-μm depth was used and motile sperm were tracked at 60 frames/s. The analysis was performed by an observer unaware of the sperm source. In the first study, 10 fields were recorded for 10 s each, and in the second study, 20 fields were recorded for 5 s each. Percent motility was determined on a minimum of 100 sperm from the recorded sperm samples. All sperm with moving flagella were counted as motile. The criteria for hyperactivation of sperm motility was defined as linearity (departure of the cell track from a straight line) less than 40%, lateral head displacement (average of sperm track width) greater than 6.5 μm, and track speed greater than 100 μm/s. In this study, 10–15-week-old wild type and mutant males and 8-week-old C57BL/6 females were used. Two females were placed with each male. Females were checked daily for vaginal plugs as an indication that mating had occurred. Cohabitation continued either for 5 days at which point the females were removed for 2 days or until a plug was found. Matings continued until each male had successfully mated with at least four females. All mated females were euthanized 14 days after the discovery of the plug and the number of live and reabsorbed fetuses were counted. Pregnancy rate was calculated as the proportion of matings that produced pregnancy. Litter size was counted from implantations. The proportion of live fetuses was determined from the ratio of live fetuses to total implantations. The acrosomal status of spermatozoa was analyzed using a Pisum sativum lectin staining method (37Cross N.L. Morales P. Overstreet J.W. Hanson F.W. Gamete Res. 1986; 15: 213-226Crossref Scopus (543) Google Scholar). Sperm were incubated in the bicarbonate-free medium used for sperm motility measurements (above) for 5.5 h and then diluted 10-fold. Hoechst 33258 dye (bisbenzidine, Riedel-de Haen AG, Hanover, Germany; 1 μg/ml) was added to stain the nuclei of permeable (“dead”) sperm. After 2 min of incubation the sperm were diluted 2-fold with fresh medium and collected (250 ×g; 5 min). Cells were resuspended and washed by two more cycles of dilution and sedimentation. The cell pellet was resuspended in 50 μl of ice-cold ethanol and stored at 4 °C. Aliquots of the ethanol-permeabilized sperm were dried onto spots on 4-spot Teflon-coated slides (Cel-Line Associates) and hydrated with 10 mm Hepes buffer, pH 7.4, containing 150 mmNaCl, 0.1 mm CaCl2, 0.01 mmMnCl2, and fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled P. sativum (Vector Laboratories, 25 μg/ml). After 20–30 min, the slides were washed in distilled water, mounted in buffered 90% glycerol solution (containing 0.05 m Tris, pH 8.5, and 1% 1,4-diazabicyclo-(2,2,2)octane; Sigma). Stained sperm were examined by epifluorescence microscopy under fluorescein isothiocyanate, UV, and phase contrast conditions on a Nikon Labophot-2 microscope. For each genotype, 100–200 sperm that had excluded the Hoechst dye were scored for acrosomal loss. Sperm with intact acrosomes were easily distinguished by the presence of a broad, uniform, brightly fluorescent arc corresponding to the anterior or dorsal portion of the acrosome. Sperm that had lost their acrosomes had only diffuse, less intense staining in the equatorial segment. Only sperm oriented so as to display the acrosomal crescent were assessed. Unpaired t tests were performed when comparing between wild type and mutant groups. The initial characterization of mice that contain a targeted deletion of the RIIα gene was described in a previous report (32Burton K.A. Johnson B.D. Hausken Z.E. Westenbroek R.E. Idzerda R.L. Scheuer T. Scott J.D. Catterall W.A. McKnight G.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11067-11072Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). It was shown that the RIIα protein is absent in all tissues examined including the testis and that these mice are viable and healthy. To examine the effect of a genetic deletion of RIIα on the expression of PKA subunits in sperm, we performed a Western analysis on sperm samples from wild type and mutant mice. As shown in Fig. 1, the mutant sperm are completely deficient in RIIα protein. However, RIα protein levels are elevated severalfold compared with wild type sperm. There is no apparent change in Cα protein content of mutant sperm. RIIβ and RIβ protein were not detected in wild type or mutant sperm (data not shown). The compensatory increase in the expression of RIα is most likely the result of its increased association with C subunit that is no longer bound to RIIα. We have observed a similar increase in RIα subunit expression in the RIIβ mutant mouse and determined that the RIα subunit has an increased half-life presumably as a consequence of its sequestration in the holoenzyme complex (38Amieux P.S. Cummings D.E. Motamed K. Brandon E.P. Wailes L.A. Le K. Idzerda R.L. McKnight G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3993-3998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). The lack of a difference in C subunit content of mutant and wild type sperm suggests that the association with RIα prevents a change in C subunit levels. In summary, the loss of RIIα in mutant sperm results in a compensatory increase in RIα with no change in C subunit levels. The RIα and RIIα isoforms differ in their affinity for various anchoring proteins (AKAPs). Therefore we anticipated that a shift from the expression of RIIα in wild type sperm to RIα in mutant sperm would alter the intracellular localization of PKA. An examination of the partitioning of PKA subunits into the detergent-soluble and detergent-insoluble fraction (Fig. 2) confirms this prediction. In wild type sperm, RIIα and Cα protein are found in both the detergent-soluble and detergent-insoluble fractions. RIα protein content in both fractions is much lower. With longer exposure times these immunoblots show that RIα protein is present in equivalent amounts in both fractions of sperm (data not shown). By contrast, in mutant sperm RIIα protein is absent in both fractions, and RIα and Cα proteins are detected primarily in the detergent-soluble fraction. These results suggest that in mutant sperm, PKA is no longer bound to the detergent-resistant structures but is found primarily in the soluble fraction. To confirm the differences in PKA distribution within mutant and wild type sperm, as indicated by cell fractionation, we examined the immunolocalization of PKA subunits in sperm (Fig. 3). As shown in Fig. 3 a, RIIα immunoreactivity was found in the flagellum of wild type sperm. The staining was greater in the midpiece and in the distal portion of the principle piece. No RIIα immunoreactivity was detected in the mutant sperm (Fig. 3 d). Fig. 3b shows that RIα immunoreactivity was undetectable in wild type sperm. However, in mutant sperm (Fig. 3 e), RIα immunoreactivity was strong in the cytoplasmic droplet. Cα and RIIα were similarly distributed along the flagellum (with higher staining in the midpiece and in the end of the principal piece) in wild type sperm. Interestingly, in mutant sperm, Cα and RIα were colocalized. Cα immunoreactivity was limited to the cytoplasmic droplet (Fig.3 f) for the vast majority of cells. In less than 10% of the mutant sperm, Cα staining was also faintly detectable in the midpiece (data not shown). Immunocytochemistry performed on wild type and mutant sperm in the absence of primary antibody produced samples with no staining (data not shown). The colocalization of RIα and C subunit suggests that the type I PKA holoenzyme (RIα2Cα2) is found primarily in the cytoplasmic droplet of mutant sperm. The density gradient studies in Fig. 4 support this interpretation. Cytoplasmic droplets were separated from whole sperm by a discontinuous sucrose gradient, and protein extracts from both were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and probed for the presence of PKA subunits. It is important to note that the gradient separation is only partially successful with a considerable level of cytoplasmic droplet containing sperm still present in the whole sperm fraction but only a few sperm contaminating the droplet fraction. For wild type sperm, RIIα and C subunits were found primarily in the whole sperm fraction with only low levels appearing in the cytoplasmic droplet fraction. RIα protein was not detected in either fraction. For mutant sperm, C and RIα were present in both the cytoplasmic droplet and whole sperm fractions. In summary, by both immunocytochemical and cell fractionation studies, we find that PKA is no longer anchored to the flagellum but is redistributed to the cytoplasmic droplet. The unchanged levels of Cα and enhanced expression of RIα in sperm of mutant mice might allow PKA to fulfill some of its normal functions in sperm. However, the loss of anchoring of PKA to the flagellum suggested that deficits in motility (and therefore fertility) would occur. We examined this hypothesis by comparing the fertility of wild type and mutant males. These mice were mated with females until four plugged females were identified. On day 14 of gestation, plugged females were euthanized, and litter size was measured. Results are shown in TableI. There was no significant difference between wild type and mutant males in length of time to plug four females, pregnancy rate, litter size, or percentage of live fetuses.Table IMale fertility in wild type and RIIα knockout miceWeeks to plug 4 femalesPregnancy rate (litters/plugs)Live fetusesTotal litter size%%Wild type (n = 10)4.4 ± 0.577 ± 691 ± 27.9 ± 0.2Knockout (n = 11)4.1 ± 0.366 ± 1195 ± 27.4 ± 0.4 Open table in a new tab Despite the indication that mutant mice have normal fertility, we reasoned that more subtle defects in sperm function might be revealed by a comparison of motility parameters for wild type and mutant sperm. Sperm were incubated in vitro either in a medium that supports capacitation or in a simpler medium that was supplemented with permeant cAMP analogues. Fig. 5(a and b) shows that in the capacitating medium, swimming speed and the proportion of motile sperm were not significantly different for mutant and control animals, and similar results were obtained when motility was examined in a simpler, bicarbonate-free medium (Fig. 5, c and d). The percentage of sperm that were hyperactivated was no different between wild type and mutant sperm in either medium (data not shown). The effects of both Sp-cAMP in stimulating and Rp-cAMP in inhibiting sperm motility were small or absent, respectively, indicating that once initiated, sperm motility is independent of PKA activity. In summary, these results indicate that mutant male mice are fertile and that mutant sperm motility is not significantly different from that of wild type. Although most attention has been directed to the role of PKA in the control of sperm motility, some reports indicate that sperm cAMP content increases under conditions that promote spontaneous acrosome reaction (3Tash J.S. Means A.R. Biol. Reprod. 1983; 28: 75-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). Therefore we also considered the possibility that alterations in the composition and localization of PKA in mutant sperm might alter this measure of sperm exocytotic function. However, we observed no difference in the proportion of wild type and mutant sperm that had undergone the acrosome reaction (wild type, 36 ± 4%; knockout, 32 ± 3%). These results indicate that RIIα-deficient sperm are not significantly different than wild type sperm when comparing the ability of the sperm to release acrosomal contents. Despite much study, the intracellular signaling pathways that govern sperm motility have not been defined. Considerable attention has focused on the cAMP system because it was shown that drugs that elevate cAMP (phosphodiesterase inhibitors) lead to increased motility. Until recently, the only pathway for cAMP action in sperm was assumed to be PKA, and this assumption was bolstered by the observed induction of the RIIα regulatory subunit late in spermatogenesis and the expression of several high affinity PKA anchoring proteins associated with either the mitochondria (S-AKAP84/d-AKAP1) or the fibrous sheath (AKAP82/FSC1). However, the recent demonstrations of a cyclic nucleotide-gated ion channel in sperm and of the cAMP-mediated guanine nucleotide exchange factors in testes provide additional pathways by which cAMP might act to stimulate motility. With these possibilities in mind, we have reinvestigated the potential role of PKA in stimulating sperm motility. Our approach was to produce a mutation in the major sperm regulatory subunit gene, RIIα, that eliminates its expression. This study shows that male mice lacking RIIα protein are fertile and that the motility of sperm from mutant mice is not impaired. RIα subunit levels are dramatically elevated in mutant sperm compared with levels in wild type sperm. This compensation by RIα has been observed in other tissues of RIIα mutants (32Burton K.A. Johnson B.D. Hausken Z.E. Westenbroek R.E. Idzerda R.L. Scheuer T. Scott J.D. Catterall W.A. McKnight G.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11067-11072Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) and RIIβ mutants (39Cummings D.E. Brandon E.P. Planas J.V. Motamed K. Idzerda R.L. McKnight G.S. Nature. 1996; 382: 622-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). The increase in RIα levels in sperm from RIIα mutants most likely results from increased protein stabilization of RIα in a holoenzyme complex that serves to protect the sperm from unregulated C subunit activity (38Amieux P.S. Cummings D.E. Motamed K. Brandon E.P. Wailes L.A. Le K. Idzerda R.L. McKnight G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3993-3998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). As a consequence of the increased levels in RIα subunit, C subunit is bound in the stable holoenzyme complex and its levels are therefore not altered in mutant sperm. The PKA isozyme shift from a predominantly type II PKA, as seen in wild type sperm (17Conti M. Adamo S. Geremia R. Monesi V. Biol. Reprod. 1983; 28: 860-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 20Horowitz J.A. Toeg H. Orr G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 832-838Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), to a type I PKA in mutant sperm correlates with a change in the intracellular distribution of the C subunit. In wild type sperm, a major fraction of RIIα and C subunits is found in the Triton-insoluble pellet. By immunocytochemistry, these subunits are localized in the flagellum with highest levels in the midpiece. This pattern of RIIα and C staining has been observed by others (22Lieberman S.J. Wasco W. Macleod J. Satir P. Orr G.A. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 1809-1816Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 23Vijayaraghavan S. Olson G.E. NagDas S. Winfrey V.P. Carr D.W. Biol. Reprod. 1997; 57: 1517-1523Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar,40Johnson L.R. Foster J.A. Haig-Ladewig L. VanScoy H. Rubin C.S. Moss S.B. Gerton G.L. Dev. Biol. 1997; 192: 340-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). In mutant sperm, RIα and C subunits are found primarily in the Triton-soluble fraction and, by immunocytochemistry and density gradient experiments, in the cytoplasmic droplet. The fractionation studies demonstrate that the detergent-soluble type I PKA in mutant sperm is not anchored to the flagellum and is, therefore, more readily released into the Triton-soluble fraction. Recent biochemical studies have shown that RIα is capable of binding to a subset of the AKAPs identified in sperm including AKAP82/FSC1, which forms part of the fibrous sheath surrounding the flagellum (28Miki K. Eddy E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34384-34390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), and SAKAP-84/d-AKAP1, which localizes to mitochondria (27Huang L.J. Durick K. Weiner J.A. Chun J. Taylor S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8057-8064Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar) but is found only in immature sperm and is lost during maturation (25Lin R.-Y. Moss S.B. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27804-27811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). The relative affinity of FSC1 for RI and RII has not been measured, but the apparent dissociation of PKA from the flagellum in RIIα mutant sperm suggests that the interaction of RI with FSC1 is not strong enough to localize the holoenzyme in vivo. S-AKAP84/d-AKAP1 binds to RI with about a 25-fold weaker affinity compared with RII, but this may be sufficient to localize PKA to mitochondria during the elongating spermatid stage. As the sperm mature, S-AKAP84/d-AKAP1 is lost, and we would not expect to see mitochondrial localization in mature sperm of an RI-containing PKA holoenzyme. Although RIα is not the major regulatory subunit expressed in mature sperm, it is present in low but detectable amounts in both the pellet and Triton-soluble fractions of wild type sperm. However, by immunocytochemistry, this subunit was not detected in wild type sperm. This result is not in agreement with previous reports in which RIα was found throughout the entire sperm (8Visconti P.E. Johnson L.R. Oyaskim M. Fornes M. Moss S.B. Gerton G.L. Kopf G.S. Dev. Biol. 1997; 192: 351-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 41Moos J. Peknicova J. Geussova G. Philimonenko V. Hozak P. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 1998; 50: 79-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) and suggests that our assay is not sensitive enough to detect small amounts of RIα. This raises the possibility that small but undetectable amounts of RIα may be associated with the flagellum of RIIα mutant sperm. If PKA exists as a holoenzyme in RIIα mutant sperm, then the C subunit should also be detected along its flagellum. However, in the majority of RIIα mutant sperm, C subunit was found in the cytoplasmic droplet, a localization that was dramatically different from that observed in wild type sperm flagellum. Although C and RIα subunits were not detected along the flagellum in RIIα mutant sperm, it is possible that a small amount of PKA is associated with the flagellum and stimulates sperm motility. Our demonstration that the majority of PKA is not anchored to the flagellum in RIIα mutant sperm with no deleterious effects on sperm motility does not support the findings of Vijayarghavan et al. (31Vijayarghavan S. Goueli S.A. Davey M.P. Carr D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4747-4752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar), who showed that the motility of bovine and primate sperm was inhibited by a cell-permeant peptide (stearated Ht31) that blocks the association of PKA with AKAPs and presumably prevents the phosphorylation of key PKA substrates. This discrepancy suggests either a species difference in the dependence of sperm motility on anchored PKA or a nonspecific effect of stearated Ht31. Indeed, if stearated Ht31 blocked the ability of PKA to phosphorylate those substrate proteins required for motility, then it would be predicted that stearated PKI, an inhibitor of PKA activity, would likewise block motility. However, in this same study, stearated PKI did not block motility, which leads one to question the specificity of these stearated peptides. RIIα knockout mice are fertile. Although the sample size in this fertility study is too small to detect small differences in pregnancy rate (42Berndtson W.E. Judd J.E. Castro A.C. J. Androl. 1997; 18: 717-724PubMed Google Scholar), this study, as well as ongoing successful breeding of the mutant mice for 3 years, demonstrates that the RIIα protein is not required for successful reproduction. This result is supported by our findings that there is no significant deficit in sperm motility or in the ability of mutant sperm to undergo the acrosome reaction. It is conceivable, however, that subtle deficits in fertilization capability are present in RIIα mutant sperm that would be revealed by a sperm competition assay, as was shown with acrosin knockout mouse sperm (43Adham I.M. Nayernia K. Engel W. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 1997; 46: 370-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), but this awaits further study. Our findings clearly indicate that RIIα is not essential for sperm motility and fertilization. In addition the loss of anchored PKA along the flagellum, as a result of the compensation by RIα, does not observably affect normal sperm function. The presence of PKA primarily in the cytoplasmic droplet of motile mutant sperm raises the possibility that PKA is not required for motility of mature sperm and that other targets of cAMP action are mediating its effects. It remains to be determined, however, whether PKA is anchored in earlier stages of spermatogenesis in the RIIα mutant by the interaction of RIα with AKAPs that are expressed in immature sperm, such as S-AKAP84/d-AKAP1, and whether this localization is essential for the maturation of sperm.

Targeted mutation of the murine α3 integrin gene resulted in abnormal branching morphogenesis of kidney capillary loops and lung bronchi. Based on antibody inhibition, this integrin may also be important for branching morphogenesis in mammary epithelia (2Stahl S. Weitzman S. Jones J.C.R. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 55-63Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to its essential roles in normal development, the α3β1 integrin may play important roles in disease processes, such as cancer. Loss of integrin α3subunit expression is a negative prognostic factor in lung adenocarcinoma (3Adachi M. Taki T. Huang C. Higashiyama M. Doi O. Tsuji T. Miyake M. J. Clin.

Conversely, overexpression of α3β1 integrin in a human rhabdomyosarcoma line suppressed tumor formation in mouse xenografts (4Weitzman J.B. Hemler M.E. Brodt P. Cell Adhes.

The α3β1 integrin has been reported to recognize several extracellular matrix ligands, including some laminins, type IV collagen, fibronectin, thrombospondin-1, and entactin/nidogen (5DeFreitas M.F.

Chem. 1991; 266: 12809-12812Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), previous attempts to define recognition sequences for binding of matrix ligands to the α3β1 integrin have produced conflicting results. High affinity binding of recombinant soluble α3β1 could be detected only to laminin-5 (10Eble J.A. Wucherpfennig K.W. Gauthier L. Dersch P. Krukonis E. Isberg R.R. Hemler M.E.

Under specific conditions, this integrin can recognize the common integrin binding sequence RGD in fibronectin (6Elices M.J. Urry L.A. Hemler M.E. J.

These data, combined with the evidence that RGD-dependent and RGD-independent adhesion are differentially regulated in α3β1 integrin (6Elices M.J. Urry L.A. Hemler M.E. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 112: 169-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar), have led to the proposal that the α3β1 integrin uses distinct mechanisms to interact with each of its ligands and that no conserved binding motif may exist (6Elices M.J. Urry L.A. Hemler M.E. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 112: 169-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar).

Protein sequences were compared using MACAW software (National Center for Biotechnology Information, National Library of Medicine, version 2.0.5) by the segment pair overlap and Gibbs sampler methods (27Schuler G.D.

Science. 1993; 262: 208-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (1416) Google Scholar). In initial attempts to localize the region of TSP1 recognized by the α3β1 integrin, we tested approximately 85% of the TSP1 sequence in the form of synthetic peptides or GST or T7 fusion proteins for promotion of β1integrin-dependent adhesion of MDA-MB-435 cells (Fig.1). Among the recombinant fragments tested, only an 18-kDa fragment of the N-terminal heparin-binding domain had significant adhesive activity, although the recombinant type I repeats had adhesive activity for MDA-MB-435 cells in some experiments (results not shown). A recombinant GST fusion of the type 3 repeats of TSP1 including the RGD sequence had minimal adhesive activity for MDA-MB-435 cells (Fig. 1), in contrast to human melanoma cells, which avidly attached on substrates coated with the same concentrations of this fragment (26Sipes J.M. Krutzsch H.C. Lawler J. Roberts D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22755-22762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The β1integrin-activating antibody TS2/16 did not enhance cell attachment to any of these recombinant fragments but reproducibly stimulated attachment on intact TSP1 (Fig. 1). Synthetic heparin-binding peptides from the type 1 repeats (peptide 246) (16Guo N.H. Krutzsch H.C. Nègre E. Vogel T. Blake D.A. Roberts D.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 3040-3044Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) and the CD47-binding peptide 4N1K (21Gao A.-G. Lindberg F.P. Finn M.B. Blystone S.D. Brown E.J. Frazier W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21-24Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar) also promoted adhesion, but TS2/16 did not enhance adhesion of MDA-MB-435 cells to these peptides. CD36-binding peptides from the procollagen domain (peptide 500) or the type 1 repeats (Mal-II) (29Dawson D.W. Pearce S.F. Zhong R. Silverstein R.L. Frazier W.A. Bouck N.P. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 707-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar) had weaker adhesive activities and were also insensitive to TS2/16. The focal adhesion disrupting peptide Hep1 from the N-terminal domain of TSP1 (20Murphy-Ullrich J.E. Gurusiddappa S. Frazier W.A. Höök M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26784-26789Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) did not promote MDA-MB-435 cell adhesion. Although these experiments did not detect a β1integrin-dependent adhesive sequence in TSP1, the possibility remains that these regions of TSP1 contain a conformation-dependent recognition motif that is inactive in the recombinant fusion proteins due to misfolding. A multiple alignment search using MACAW software was used to identify TSP1 sequences that might be related to the α3β1 integrin-binding GD6 peptide derived from the A chain of murine laminin-1 (12Gehlsen K.R. Sriramarao P. Furcht L.T. Skubitz A.P. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 449-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), which strongly promoted MDA-MB-435 cell adhesion (Fig.2 A). This search identified four TSP1 sequences related to the laminin peptide (TableI). The single peptide identified by the Gibbs sampler method, derived from the C-terminal domain of TSP1 (residues 1059–1077), did not support adhesion or inhibit adhesion of MDA-MB-435 cells to TSP1 or other α3β1integrin ligands (Fig. 2 A and results not shown). Because a synthetic peptide containing the last 12 residues of peptide GD6 (peptide 679, Table I) had similar activity to the intact peptide (see below), we did not test the two peptides identified by segment pair overlap that aligned outside this sequence. Both of these peptides were derived from regions of the type 1 (residues 392–405) or type 2 (residues 598–608) repeat sequences that did not support α3β1-dependent adhesion when expressed as GST fusion proteins (Fig. 1).Table ITSP1 sequences related to murine laminin-1 peptide GD6Peptide originSequenceMP score vs. GD6p valueLaminin GD6KQNCLSSRASFRGCVRNLRLSRLaminin p679FRGCVRNLRLSRTSP1 (598–608)NCLPCPPRFTG42.01-aAlignment scores were determined by segment pair overlap.5.9 × 10−8TSP1 (188–199)DNFQGVLQNVRF39.01-aAlignment scores were determined by segment pair overlap.5.9 × 10−7TSP1 (392–405)NNRCEGSSVQTRTC35.01-aAlignment scores were determined by segment pair overlap.4.5 × 10−4TSP1 (1059–1077) RNALWHTGNTPGQVRTLWH43.31-bAlignment by Gibbs sampler method.2.1 × 10−8The amino acid sequences for human and murine TSP1 and laminin-1 peptide GD6 were compared by multiple alignment using MACAW.1-a Alignment scores were determined by segment pair overlap.1-b Alignment by Gibbs sampler method. Open table in a new tab The amino acid sequences for human and murine TSP1 and laminin-1 peptide GD6 were compared by multiple alignment using MACAW. The remaining sequence is from a region of the N-terminal domain of TSP1 (residues 188–199) that was not covered by the recombinant fragments tested in Fig. 1 and conserves most of the hydrophilic residues in the laminin-1 GD6 peptide that could mediate protein-protein interactions. This sequence also overlaps with a region identified in a screen of N-terminal TSP1 peptides as having heparin-independent adhesive activity (30Clezardin P. Lawler J. Amiral J. Quentin G. Delmas P. Biochem. J. 1997; 321: 819-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). A synthetic peptide containing this TSP1 sequence (peptide 678) had strong adhesive activity for MDA-MB-435 cells (Fig. 2 A). Spreading of two breast carcinoma cell lines on this peptide, laminin peptide GD6, and TSP1 was enhanced in the presence of the β1integrin-activating antibody TS2/16 (Fig. 2 B). We previously found that IGF1 strongly stimulated β1 integrin-mediated adhesion to TSP1 (14Chandrasekaran S. Guo N. Rodrigues R.G. Kaiser J. Roberts D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11408-11416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). IGF1 similarly stimulated spreading of MDA-MB-435 cells on the TSP1 peptide 678 and to the laminin peptide GD6 (Fig. 2 B). The TSP1 peptide 678 strongly inhibited spreading of MDA-MB-435 cells on TSP1 and murine EHS tumor-derived laminin-1/entactin but did not inhibit spreading of the same cells on the α5β1 integrin ligand fibronectin or on type IV collagen (Fig. 3 A). The TSP1 peptide in solution strongly inhibited MDA-MB-435 cell attachment to itself and to GD6 (Fig. 3 B), a known α3β1 integrin-binding peptide from murine laminin-1 (12Gehlsen K.R. Sriramarao P. Furcht L.T. Skubitz A.P. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 449-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). In contrast, the laminin peptide was a relatively weak inhibitor of adhesion to either peptide or TSP1 when tested in solution (IC50 = 700 μm, data not shown). The TSP1 peptide 678 sequence was not in the recombinant N-terminal fragment tested in Fig. 1, but the previously reported 28-kDa N-terminal fragment of TSP1 contains this sequence (22Vogel T. Guo N.H. Krutzsch H.C. Blake D.A. Hartman J. Mendelovitz S. Panet A. Roberts D.D. J. Cell. Biochem. 1993; 53: 74-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Adhesion assays using MDA-MB-231 (Fig. 3 C) and MDA-MB-435 breast carcinoma cell lines (data not shown) verified that the larger fragment, expressing residues 1–242, contains a β1integrin-dependent adhesion sequence that is not present in residues 1–174. Adhesion to the longer fragment was stimulated by the β1-activating antibody TS2/16 and inhibited by peptide 678 (Fig. 3 C). Therefore, a β1integrin-binding site is present in residues 175–242 of TSP1 and is functional when expressed as a recombinant protein. To verify that the TSP1 peptide 678 contains an α3β1 integrin recognition sequence, integrin α-subunit antibodies were tested for blocking adhesion to the peptide (Fig. 4). The α3-specific blocking antibody P1B5, which we have shown to inhibit adhesion of the same cells to intact TSP1 (14Chandrasekaran S. Guo N. Rodrigues R.G. Kaiser J. Roberts D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11408-11416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), partially inhibited adhesion of MDA-MB-435 cells on peptide 678 and completely reversed the enhancement of MDA-MB-435 cell adhesion to the same peptide stimulated by the β1 integrin-activating antibody TS2/16. In a further control experiment, the α2β1-blocking antibody 6D7 inhibited adhesion of MDA-MB-435 cells to type I collagen but not to peptide 678 (Fig. 4 B). Function-blocking antibodies for α4β1 and α5β1integrins also had no effect on adhesion to peptide 678 (data not shown). Therefore, the peptide does not support adhesion mediated by α4β1 or α5β1integrins or inhibit adhesion to other integrin ligands. Divalent cation dependence is also characteristic for binding of integrin ligands. Although Mn2+ but not Ca2+induced the expected increase in MDA-MB-435 cell spreading on TSP1 peptide 678 and intact TSP1 (Fig. 4 C), addition of EDTA only minimally inhibited basal spreading on peptide 678. EDTA completely inhibited the spreading on TSP1 observed in medium containing Mg2+ as the sole divalent cation, although it did not inhibit cell attachment on TSP1 (Fig. 4 C and results not shown). This residual adhesion probably results from the significant contribution of proteoglycans to adhesion of MDA-MB-435 cells on TSP1 (14Chandrasekaran S. Guo N. Rodrigues R.G. Kaiser J. Roberts D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11408-11416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Spreading on peptide 678 with Mg2+ as the divalent cation became partially sensitive to EDTA, however, in the presence of the β1-activating antibody TS2/16. Addition of Mn2+ further stimulated spreading on peptide 678 and intact TSP1 in the presence of TS2/16, but addition of Ca2+produced a dose-dependent inhibition of spreading on both substrates. Specific inhibition by Ca2+ is consistent with previous data for the α3β1 integrin (31Weitzman J.B. Pasqualini R. Takada Y. Hemler M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8651-8657Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These results suggest that integrin binding to peptide 678 is partially independent of divalent cations, but MDA-MB-435 cell spreading on this peptide may involve both α3β1integrin binding and divalent cation-independent interactions with another cell surface molecule. Truncated peptides that contained portions of peptide 678 were synthesized to identify essential residues (Fig.5). Truncation of the N-terminal Phe or the C-terminal Val-Phe only moderately decreased adhesive activity, but further truncations from either end of the peptide greatly diminished its activity. Inhibition assays confirmed that the loss of adhesive activity reflected loss of integrin binding rather than loss of ability to adsorb on the substrate (Table II). As found in the direct adhesion assays, peptides without the N-terminal Phe or the C-terminal Val-Phe retained significant inhibitory activities, but all shorter peptides were weak inhibitors or inactive. These results imply that the integrin recognizes an extended sequence, but this approach could not discriminate conformational effects of flanking sequences from a direct contribution to integrin binding.Table IIInhibition of MDA-MB-435 cell adhesion to immobilized peptide 678 by fragments of the active peptidePeptideSequenceIC50μm678FQGVLQNVRFVF (TSP1)3.5682FQGVLQNVRF6683 QGVLQNVR>300685 QGVLQNVRFVF24688VLQNVRFVF>100684LQNVRFVF300681 ac-LQNVRF-am700Mean doses to achieve 50% inhibition of control adhesion (IC50) to polystyrene coated with 5 μm peptide 678 were determined from at least three independent experiments, each performed in triplicate. Peptides were tested at up to 300 μm or to the solubility limit for each peptide, where lower limits for inhibitory activity are indicated. Open table in a new tab Mean doses to achieve 50% inhibition of control adhesion (IC50) to polystyrene coated with 5 μm peptide 678 were determined from at least three independent experiments, each performed in triplicate. Peptides were tested at up to 300 μm or to the solubility limit for each peptide, where lower limits for inhibitory activity are indicated. To better define those residues involved in α3β1 integrin binding, we systematically substituted Ala residues into the peptide 678 and tested each for adhesive activity (Fig. 6). Based on the complete loss of adhesion activity for MDA-MB-435 cells following its substitution, only Arg-198 was essential for adhesive activity of peptide 678 (Fig. 6). Replacement of Arg-198 with a His also dramatically reduced adhesive activity. Ala substitutions at several other positions significantly decreased adhesive activity, except for the two N-terminal residues, which only slightly decreased adhesive activity. Although only the Arg residue was essential for direct adhesion, substitution of several additional residues with Ala markedly decreased or abolished inhibitory activity of the respective soluble peptides in solution to block α3β1-dependent adhesion to immobilized peptide 678 (Table III). These experiments showed that Arg-198, Val-197, and Asn-196 are essential for inhibitory activity of the peptides in solution. Substitution of Phe-199 and Phe-201 decreased the inhibitory activities of the respective peptides 5–8-fold, indicating that these flanking residues also contribute to activity of the peptides in solution. In contrast, peptides with Ala substitutions at four of the six N-terminal residues in this sequence had inhibitory activities equivalent to that of the native TSP1 sequence. Therefore, NVR is the essential sequence for binding to the α3β1 integrin, but flanking residues may be necessary for inducing the proper conformation of this minimal sequence in peptide 678.Table IIIMapping of essential residues for inhibition of MDA-MB-435 cell adhesion to immobilized peptide 678PeptideSequenceIC50μm678FQGVLQNVRFVF (TSP1)3.5697AQGVLQNVRFVF5696FAGVLQNVRFVF1.8695FQGVAQNVRFVF5687FQGVLANVRFVF3686FQGVLQAVRFVF>300691FQGVLQNARFVF>300690FQGVLQNVAFVF>300702FQGVLQNVKFVF6694FQGVLQNVHFVF54703FQGVLQNVQFVF>100692FQGVLQNVRAVF18693FQGVLQNVRFVA27Mean doses to achieve 50% inhibition of control adhesion to 5 μm peptide 678 (IC50) were determined from at least three independent experiments, each performed in triplicate.

Open table in a new tab Mean doses to achieve 50% inhibition of control adhesion to 5 μm peptide 678 (IC50) were determined from at least three independent experiments, each performed in triplicate. Residues substituted in the native TSP1 sequence are underlined. The specificity for an Arg residue at position 198 was further examined using conservative amino acid substitutions (Table III). Substitution with Lys decreased activity approximately 2-fold, whereas substitution with Gln, to retain hydrogen-bonding ability while removing the positive charge, abolished the inhibitory activity. A His substitution showed intermediate activity, indicating that a positive charge rather than a large side chain with hydrogen bonding ability is required at this position. The active peptides strongly promoted formation of filopodia in MDA-MB-435 cells (Fig. 7 A) similar to those induced by attachment on intact TSP1 (14Chandrasekaran S. Guo N. Rodrigues R.G. Kaiser J. Roberts D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11408-11416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Addition of IGF1 enhanced spreading and increased formation of lamellipodia on the same peptide (Fig. 7 B). Phallacidin staining demonstrated organization of F-actin at the cell periphery but no organization of stress fibers across the cell body (Fig. 7 C). Using antibodies recognizing vinculin (Fig. 7 D) and focal adhesion kinase (data not shown) as markers of focal adhesion formation, we could not detect any induction of focal adhesions in MDA-MB-435 cells attaching on these peptides, although the same markers showed typical focal adhesion staining patterns in the cells when attaching on vitronectin or fibronectin substrates (results not shown). Staining for the α3β1 integrin was punctate and prominently localized in filopodia extended by MDA-MB-435 cells on immobilized peptide 678 (Fig. 7 F), whereas total β1 integrin staining was more diffuse and concentrated over the cell body. TSP1 stimulates chemotaxis of MDA-MB-435 cells, and this response is inhibited by the α3β1-blocking antibody P1B5 (14Chandrasekaran S. Guo N. Rodrigues R.G. Kaiser J. Roberts D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11408-11416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Peptide 678 also stimulated chemotaxis of MDA-MB-435 cells (Fig. 8). Chemotaxis to peptide 678 was dose-dependent with a maximal response at 10 μm (Fig. 8 A). This response was specific in that peptide 690 was inactive. In agreement with the observations that IGF1 stimulated β1 integrin-dependent chemotaxis of MDA-MB-435 cells to TSP1 (14Chandrasekaran S. Guo N. Rodrigues R.G. Kaiser J. Roberts D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11408-11416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) and adhesion of the same cells to peptide 678 (Figs. 2 and 7), the chemotactic response of MDA-MB-435 cells to peptide 678, but not to peptide 690, was increased in the presence of IGF1 (Fig. 8 B). Based on examination of synthetic peptides and recombinant fragments representing approximately 90% of the TSP1 sequence, only the sequence FQGVLQNVRFVF from the N-terminal domain exhibited activities that are expected for an α3β1integrin binding sequence in TSP1. A recombinant fragment of TSP1 containing this sequence also promoted β1integrin-dependent adhesion. In solution, this peptide specifically inhibited adhesion to TSP1 but not to ligands recognized by other integrins. Adhesion to this peptide and to TSP1 was stimulated by IGF1 receptor ligands that stimulate integrin-dependent adhesion to intact TSP1, by Mn2+, and by a β1integrin-activating antibody and partially inhibited by an α3β1 function-blocking antibody. Based on systematic amino acid substitutions in the active sequence, NVR appears to be the essential core sequence in this TSP1 peptide for recognition by the α3β1 integrin. Adhesive activities of the immobilized peptides imply that only Arg-198 may directly participate in this interaction, although the partial resistance to inhibition by an α3β1integrin antibody and EDTA suggest that the peptides with Arg may also support adhesion independent of integrin binding. The context surrounding the Arg is important, however, because other peptides with similar sequences (such as peptide 701, with a QVRT sequence) had no activity, and Ala substitutions of the flanking residues in peptide 678 eliminated or markedly decreased its inhibitory activity in solution. The essential amino acid residues are completely conserved in human, murine, bovine, and Xenopus TSP1, but in chicken TSP1, a His replaces the Arg. A similar motif is found in murine and human TSP2, with a His residue replacing the Arg. As a free peptide, the TSP1 sequence with a His substitution was much less active, so it is not clear whether the TSP2 sequence could be recognized by α3β1 integrin. Activity of the latter sequence may be increased in an environment that increases protonation of the imidazole in His. Previous publications have not identified a consensus α3β1 integrin recognition sequence in its ligands. One hypothesis is that different ligands have unrelated binding sequences, which is supported by a recent mutagenesis study (32Krukonis E.S. Dersch P. Eble J.A. Isberg R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31837-31843Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). However, other recent data have raised questions about whether all of the proteins reported to mediate α3β1-dependent adhesion are true α3β1 ligands (33Delwel G.O. de Mleker A.A. Hogervorst F. Jaspars L.H. Fles D.L.A. Kuikman I. Lindblom A. Paulsson M. Timpl R. Sonnenberg A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 203-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). LamA2 and LamA3 were verified to bind α3β1 integrin. These have potential binding motifs based on our data, but human LamA1, which was found not to bind α3β1 with high avidity, has an Ala in the position occupied by the essential Arg in the TSP1 sequence. Substitution of Ala for the Arg in the TSP1 sequence abolished all activity of the synthetic TSP1 peptide. Among the five G domain modules of LamA3, G2 has a better consensus sequence based on our results (NLK) than does G4 (NFQ) or G5 (NIH). Expressed as recombinant proteins, only the G2 module promoted α3β1-dependent adhesion (34Mizushima H. Takamura H. Miyagi Y. Kikkawa Y. Yamanaka N. Yasumitsu H. Misugi K. Miyazaki K. Cell Growth Differ. 1997; 8: 979-987PubMed Google Scholar). Although RGD was reported to be an α3β1ligand, the RGD in entactin is not required for recognition, and the RGD in the type 3 repeats of TSP1 is not recognized by this integrin. A binding site for the α3β1 integrin in entactin was mapped to the G2 domain (residues 301–647) (11Gresham H.D. Graham I.L. Griffin G.L. Hsieh J.C. Dong L.J. Chung A.E. Senior R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30587-30594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Multiple alignment of this region of entactin against the TSP1 sequence and the murine laminin-1 peptide GD6 identified a related sequence, FSGIDEHGHLTI, but this sequence lacks all of the essential residues in the TSP1 sequence. This domain of entactin also contains two N X R sequences: NNRH and NGRQ. It remains to be determined whether either of these can function as an α3β1 integrin recognition sequence. The absence of an Asp residue in peptide 678 may account for its partial independence of divalent cations. An Asp residue is usually considered an essential element for integrin peptide ligands (35Aota S. Yamada K.M. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1995; 70: 1-21PubMed Google Scholar, 36Ruoslahti E. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 697-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (2488) Google Scholar). According to one model for integrin ligand binding, the divalent cation participates directly in binding an Asp-containing peptide ligand (reviewed in Ref. 37Fernandez C. Clark K. Burrows L. Schofield N.R. Humphries M.J. Frontiers Biosci. 1998; 3: 684-700Crossref Google Scholar). Thus an integrin peptide ligand without a carboxyl side chain cannot coordinate with a bound divalent cation and therefore may not have a divalent cation requirement for binding to the integrin. The alternate model, proposing an indirect role of divalent cations in integrin activation (37Fernandez C. Clark K. Burrows L. Schofield N.R. Humphries M.J. Frontiers Biosci. 1998; 3: 684-700Crossref Google Scholar), would be consistent with the observed stimulation of cell spreading on peptide 678 by Mn2+ but not Ca2+ and the partial inhibition following chelation of divalent cations. Another interpretation of the partial divalent cation independence for the adhesive activity of peptide 678 is that ionic interactions of the Arg side chain in the TSP1 peptide with the negatively charged cell surface contribute to the adhesive activity of this peptide. Weak ionic interactions could promote adhesion to the immobilized peptide through multivalent interactions with negatively charged glycoproteins and proteoglycans on the cell but would not significantly contribute to binding of the same monovalent peptide to the cell in solution. This hypothesis would explain why the Arg-containing peptides 686 and 691, in which the essential Val or Asn residues were substituted with Ala, lacked activity in solution to inhibit adhesion to α3β1 ligands but retained some adhesive activity when immobilized. Thus, inhibitory activities in solution may provide a more reliable assessment of integrin binding specificity for Arg-containing peptides. Spreading of MDA-MB-435 breast carcinoma cells on intact TSP1 (14Chandrasekaran S. Guo N. Rodrigues R.G. Kaiser J. Roberts D.D. J. Biol.

In cells plated on peptide 678, these structures are enriched in the α3 integrin subunit, suggesting that engagement of this integrin by TSP1 triggers formation of filopodia. Formation of filopodia or microspikes has been noted during attachment of other cell types on TSP1 (38Adams J.C. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 1977-1990Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This response may be mediated by the α3β1 integrin, because lamellar spreading rather than formation of filopodia was typically observed on melanoma cells that predominantly use the αvβ3 integrin receptor for spreading on TSP1 (26Sipes J.M.

Using multiple sequence alignment, the N-terminal domains of thrombospondins were recently shown to contain a module related to pentraxins and to the G domain modules of laminins (39Beckmann G. Hanke J. Bork P. Reich J.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 275: 725-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Based on this alignment, both the α3β1 integrin-binding sequence from TSP1 identified here and the GD6 sequence of laminin are located at the C terminus of a pentraxin module. The known three-dimensional structures of other members of the same superfamily (40Shrive A.K. Cheetham G.M.T. Holden D. Myles D.A.A. Turnell W.G. Volanakis J.E. Pepys M.B. Bloomer A.C.

This observation suggests an evolutionary relationship between the thrombospondin N-terminal domains and laminin G domains that is consistent with their proposed common function as recognition sites for a β1 integrin receptor.

It has recently been shown that BPDE preferentially modifies the guanine in methylated 5′-CpG-3′ sequences in the human p53 gene, providing one explanation for why these sites are mutational hot spots. Using purified duplex oligonucleotides containing identical methylated and unmethylated CpG sequences, we show here that BPDE preferentially modified the guanine in hemimethylated or fully methylated CpG sequences, producing between 3- and 8-fold more modification at this site. Analysis of this reaction using shorter duplex oligonucleotides indicated that it was the level of the (+)-trans isomer that was specifically increased. To determine if there were conformational differences between the methylated and unmethylated B[a]P-modified DNA sequences that may be responsible for this enhanced reactivity, a native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis was carried out using DNA containing isomerically pure B[a]P-DNA adducts. These experiments showed that each adduct resulted in an altered gel mobility in duplex DNA but that only the presence of a (+)-trans isomer and a methylated C 5′ to the adduct resulted in a significant gel mobility shift compared with the unmethylated case.

Nature. 1976; 261: 52-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar), and these enantiomers display very different mutagenicities depending on the host system: the (−)-anti form is more mutagenic in bacteria, (7Wood A.W.

Bracken W.J. Gleason G. Levin W. Yagi H. Jerina D.M. Conney A.H. Cancer Res. 1979; 39: 67-71PubMed Google Scholar).Regardless of the stereochemistry of anti-BPDE, it is highly reactive, and the major adducts are formed by the cis or trans opening of the epoxide at the C-10 position by the exocyclic amine of guanine (10Weinstein I.B.

The four major guanine adducts are shown in Fig. 1 A (11Cheng S.C. Hilton B.D. Roman J.M. Dipple A. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1989; 2: 334-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). BPDE also reacts to a lesser extent with the N-6 position of adenine (11Cheng S.C. Hilton B.D. Roman J.M. Dipple A. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1989; 2: 334-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar) residues to form similar enantiomeric mixtures.The (+)-trans-anti-B[a]P-dGuo adduct is the major form produced following either in vivo or in vitro treatment, and NMR solution studies have shown that this adduct resides in the minor groove of DNA pointing toward the 5′-end of the adducted DNA strand (12Cosman M. de los Santos C. Fiala R. Hingerty B.E. Singh S.B. Ibanez V. Margulis L.A. Live D. Geacintov N.E. Broyde S. Patel D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1914-1918Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). The (−)-trans adduct is also positioned in the minor groove but points in the 3′ direction (13de los Santos C. Cosman M. Hingerty B.E. Ibanez V. Margulis L.A. Geacintov N.E. Broyde S. Patel D.J. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 5245-5252Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Phosphodiesterase digestion of single-stranded DNA oligomers containing the trans adducts have also shown these same adduct orientations (14Mao B. Li B. Amin S. Cosman M. Geacintov N.E. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 11785-11793Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). NMR studies indicate that both of the cis isomers are more intercalated into the helix, with the (+)-cis pointing toward the minor groove and the (−)-cis isomers pointing toward the major groove (15Cosman M. de los Santos C.

Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 769-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Other studies have concluded that the sequence context on the 5′- and 3′-side of the damaged guanine is also a factor in determining the extent of bending (18Liu T. Xu J. Tsao H. Li B. Xu R. Yang C. Amin S. Moriya M. Geacintov N.E. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1996; 9: 255-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 20Tsao H. Mao B. Zhuang P. Xu R. Amin S. Geacintov N.E. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 4993-5000Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar).Recently, it has been shown that the reactivity of BPDE is influenced by the methylation status of CpG sequences in the p53 gene (22Denissenko M.F. Chen J.X. Tang M. Pfeifer G.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3893-3898Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar, 23Chen J.X. Zheng Y. West M. Tang M. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 2070-2075PubMed Google Scholar). It is well established that this gene is mutated in nearly one-half of all cancers (24Greenblatt M.S. Bennett W.P. Hollstein M. Harris C.C. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 4855-4878PubMed Google Scholar) and contains six codons that are major mutagenic hot spots. Five out of these six are in methylated CpG sequences (25Tornaletti S. Pfeifer G.P. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1493-1499PubMed Google Scholar), and when the DNA binding sites for BPDE were measured in the p53 sequence in human lung cells (26Denissenko M.F. Pao A. Tang M.-s. Pfeifer G.P. Science. 1996; 274: 430-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (1496) Google Scholar) or in plasmid DNA (22Denissenko M.F. Chen J.X. Tang M. Pfeifer G.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3893-3898Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar) it was found that binding was not only targeted to these same sequences but also that methylation of the 5′-C was required for the enhanced reactivity (22Denissenko M.F. Chen J.X. Tang M. Pfeifer G.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3893-3898Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). In vitro studies have also shown that numerous carcinogens, including BPDE and N-acetoxy-N-acetyl-2-aminofluorene, show enhanced (2–5-fold) reactivity toward purified p53 DNA when the CpG sequences are methylated (23Chen J.X. Zheng Y. West M. Tang M. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 2070-2075PubMed Google Scholar).In the present study, we have used a purified system composed of BPDE and methylated and unmethylated duplex oligonucleotides to study the effect of methylation on the reactivity of BPDE at CpG sequences. In addition, the effect of methylation on B[a]P structure in DNA was also studied using a PAGE analysis. It was found that the specific presence of both a 5-mC and a (+)-trans-B[a]P-dGuo adduct (the major adduct formed in vivo) resulted in a substantial change in the DNA structure and that the level of this adduct was specifically increased when the CpG was methylated.DISCUSSIONCytosine methylation is known to play an important role in numerous cellular processes, including cellular development, cell differentiation, genetic imprinting, X-chromosome inactivation, and tumorigenesis (31Doerfler W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1983; 52: 93-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (764) Google Scholar, 32Li E. Beard C. Jaenisch R. Nature. 1993; 366: 362-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (1743) Google Scholar, 33Riggs A.D.

In addition, DNA methylation also appears to be involved in mutagenesis, since transition mutation rates of cytosines at CpG sites are 10–40 times higher compared with unmethylated sites (36Cooper D.N. Youssoufian M. Human Genet. 1988; 78: 151-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (789) Google Scholar, 37Koeberl D.D. Botteman C.D.K. Ketterling R.P. Bridge P.J. Lillicrap D.P. Sommer S.S. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1990; 47: 202-217PubMed Google Scholar). Because the majority of the mutations observed in human cancers at these sites are C:G → T:A transitions (24Greenblatt M.S. Bennett W.P. Hollstein M. Harris C.C. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 4855-4878PubMed Google Scholar, 38Hollstein M. Rice K. Greenblatt M.S. Soussi T. Fuchs R. Sorlie T. Hovig E. Smith-Sorensen B. Montesano R. Harris C.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 3551-3555PubMed Google Scholar) and 5-mC is known to deaminate 2–3-fold faster than unmethylated cytosine (39Frederico L.A. Kunkel T.A. Shaw B.R. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 2532-2537Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar,40Shen J.-C. Rideout III, W.M. Jones P.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 972-976Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar), it has been suggested that most of these mutations arise by endogenous cytosine deamination at methylated CpG sites. However, in breast, liver, and lung tumors the percentage of C:G → A:T transversions is often found to be equal to or higher than these transition mutations (41Levine A.J. Wu M.C. Chang A. Silver A. Attiyeh E.F. Lin J. Epstein C.B. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1995; 768: 111-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). For example, in lung tumors there are three CpG mutational hot spots at codons 157, 248, and 273 of the p53 gene where the predominant type of mutation is this transversion. Recently, it has been shown that these sites also appear to be preferential sites for the reaction of a variety of carcinogens, including BPDE and N-AAAF, an observation that may explain the enhanced levels of C:G → A:T transversions that are observed in lung tumors (23Chen J.X. Zheng Y. West M. Tang M. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 2070-2075PubMed Google Scholar, 24Greenblatt M.S. Bennett W.P. Hollstein M. Harris C.C. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 4855-4878PubMed Google Scholar,26Denissenko M.F. Pao A. Tang M.-s. Pfeifer G.P. Science. 1996; 274: 430-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (1496) Google Scholar, 38Hollstein M. Rice K.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 3551-3555PubMed Google Scholar).In the present study, it was found that CpG methylation caused a substantial enhancement in the rate of reaction of (±)-anti-BPDE with a purified duplex oligonucleotide compared with reaction at an identical but unmethylated sequence. If the site was methylated only in the strand that the BPDE was reacting, about a 3–4-fold increase was observed, while a fully methylated CpG sequence gave about an 5–8-fold enhancement over that occurring at an unmethylated sequence. This latter value is consistent with the enhancement observed for the reaction of BPDE with the p53 sequence in vitro, which ranged from 2- to 10-fold, depending on the sequence context of the CpG site (22Denissenko M.F. Chen J.X. Tang M. Pfeifer G.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3893-3898Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar, 23Chen J.X. Zheng Y. West M. Tang M. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 2070-2075PubMed Google Scholar).Cytosine methylation has been shown in the past to induce structural changes in duplex DNA, and it may be these altered structures that are responsible for the altered interactions with benzo[a]pyrene derivatives. Thus, methylation has been shown to slightly unwind the DNA helix (42Zacharias W. O'Connor T.R. Larson J.E. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 2970-2978Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), an effect that may result from the minor distortion that has been observed in the DNA helix caused by the positioning of the methylated GC base pair more toward the minor groove (43Heinemann U. Hahn M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7332-7341Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This latter effect also results in a concomitant decrease in the charge density in the major groove (44Hausheer F.H. Rao S.N. Gamcsik M.P. Kollman P.A. Colvin O.M. Saxe J.D. Nelkin B.D. McLennan I.J. Barnett G. Baylin S.B. Carcinogenesis. 1989; 10: 1131-1137Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Cytosine methylation has also been shown to cause a slight enhancement of the curvature of “A-tract” DNA (45Hodges-Garcia Y. Hagerman P.J. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 7595-7599Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 46Hagerman P.J. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 1980-1983Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), but in a random sequence only small localized structural perturbations were seen (47Hodges-Garcia Y. Hagerman P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 197-201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 48Diekmann S. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 4213-4217Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the CpG dinucleotide displays the strongest base-stacking interactions and the greatest degree of minor groove opening compared with each of the other DNA dinucleotides (49Saenger W. Cantor C. Principles of Nucleic Acid Structure. Springer-Verlag New York Inc., New York1984: 116-140Crossref Google Scholar, 50Ulyanov N.B. Zhurkin V.B. J. Biomol. Struct. Dyn. 1984; 2: 361-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Most relevant to the present study, it has been shown through computational analyses (44Hausheer F.H. Rao S.N. Gamcsik M.P. Kollman P.A. Colvin O.M. Saxe J.D. Nelkin B.D. McLennan I.J. Barnett G. Baylin S.B. Carcinogenesis. 1989; 10: 1131-1137Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) that cytosine methylation affords an increased helical stability resulting in increased hydrophobicity and molecular polarizability (51Sowers L.C. Shaw B.R. Sedwick W.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1987; 148: 790-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), and it may be these characteristics that lead to the increased reactivity of BPDE at these sites. In agreement with this prediction, the presence of multiple 5-methylcytosines in duplex DNA were shown to result in greater levels of noncovalent intercalation (52Geacintov N.E. Shahbaz M. Ibanez V. Moussaoui K. Harvey R.G. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 8380-8387Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Since BPDE is believed to first intercalate with DNA prior to forming a covalent adduct, an increase in intercalation or an altered structure may lead to the preferential modification seen in this study. However, it should be noted that the effect observed for DNA containing multiply methylated sites may not be a good predictor for the effect of methylation at a single CpG site.To determine if methylation affected the structure of BPDE-modified DNA, a native gel analysis was used to measure conformational changes in the duplex oligonucleotides. It has been shown in numerous studies on DNA bending that differences in native gel mobility correlate with structural changes in DNA (28Chen J.-H. Seeman N.C. Kallenbach N.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 6803-6812Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 29Nagaich A.K. Bhattacharyya D. Brahmachari S.K. Bansal M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7824-7833Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We find here that the presence of a 5-mC on the 5′-side of a (+)-trans-B[a]P-dGuo adduct specifically induced a mobility shift that was not observed for any of the other adducts, although the minor adduct did show a very slight change in mobility. Methylation was found to increase the gel mobility, suggesting that a more compact structure had formed, possibly caused by an increase in intercalation of the adduct into the DNA helix. However, the lack of a red shift in UV and CD analyses of DNA duplexes containing a (+)-trans adduct, which would be indicative of this enhanced intercalation, suggests that the explanation may not be as simple as this.These altered structures that were observed were not specific to a single sequence, suggesting that the structural change was the result of the presence of both a 5-mC and a (+)-trans-B[a]P-dGuo adduct and not caused by a sequence-mediated unique structure. Moreover, a 5-mC in the complementary strand or 3′ to the adduct position had little or no effect on the gel mobility for any of the adduct stereoisomers. Taken together, these data indicate that the structural change that is observed is not simply the result of a simultaneous structural alteration caused by the presence of a 5-mC and a B[a]P adduct but instead indicate that there may be a unique conformation that is induced by the presence of a 5-mC positioned 5′ to a (+)-trans-B[a]P-dGuo adduct.The fact that the trans isomer specifically induces the largest structural change in the methylated CpG sequence suggested that it might be this adduct whose formation is increasing. This hypothesis was tested by reacting two short duplex oligonucleotides that contained either a methylated or unmethylated CpG sequence. The relative amounts of each isomer were determined by native PAGE analysis and indicated that this prediction was valid, since there was a specific increase in only the (+)-trans material (Table I). Taken together with the structural analysis, these data may provide an explanation for the enhanced reactivity, possibly through a specific interaction between the incoming BPDE and the 5-mC positioned 5′ to the reacting guanine. The likelihood that an altered structure exists for the methylated (+)-trans isomer is supported by a recent study (53Perlow R.A. Schor J.A. Hingerty B.E. Geacintov N.E. Scicchitano D.A. Broyde S. Proc. Am. Assoc. Cancer Res. 1999; 40: 506Google Scholar) that used molecular modeling to show that methylation of CpG sequence specifically increased the preference of only the (+)-trans isomer to convert from an anti to syn conformation.Methylation of CpG sequences has also been suggested to effect the covalent binding of several other carcinogens that target guanine in duplex DNA. Mitomycin C was the first of these to be shown to target methylated CpG sequences, providing enhanced reactivity for both alkylation and cross-linking (54Johnson W.S. He Q.-Y. Tomasz M. Bioorg. Med. Chem. 1995; 3: 851-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). More recently, two related cytotoxins, esperamicins A1 and C, were found to target CpG sequences in highly methylated locations (55Mathur P. Xu J. Dedon P.C. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 14868-14873Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Methylation of CpG sequences was shown to enhance the levels of sunlight-induced cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer formation (56Tommasi S. Denissenko M.F. Pfeifer G.P. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 4727-4730PubMed Google Scholar) but inhibit the formation of 6–4 photoproducts (57Pfeifer G.P. Drouin R. Riggs A.D. Holmquist G.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 1374-1378Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Methylation has also resulted in decreased reactivity of both N-methyl and ethyl-N-nitrosourea (58Mathison B.H. Said B. Shank R.C. Carcinogenesis. 1993; 14: 323-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). From these results, it is not clear if there are specific interactions, electronic effects, or structures in the DNA that are responsible for these varied reactivities.A recent study has suggested that benzo[g]chrysene diol epoxide, aflatoxin B1, and N-AAAF all have enhanced reactivity at methylated CpG sequences in vitro (23Chen J.X. Zheng Y. West M. Tang M. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 2070-2075PubMed Google Scholar). However, these results could also be explained by a differing reactivity of the UvrABC endonuclease that is used in this analysis, since the reactivity of this enzyme is known be influenced by the structure of the damaged site (59Mekhovich O. Tang M. Romano L.J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 571-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The results presented here show that N-AAAF does not have enhanced reactivity at a fully methylated CpG sequence (Fig. 10). Moreover, the fact that it is the (+)-trans-B[a]P-dGuo isomer that is formed almost exclusively at methylated CpG sites (Fig. 9 and Table I) and that only this isomer shows a significant structural alteration in a methylated sequence (Figs. Figure 5, Figure 6, Figure 7) suggests that methylation is inducing a structural change that participates in this reaction in a very specific manner rather than through a global change or electronic effect that targets many reactive species to these sites.In conclusion, although most previous discussions of the role of 5-mC in mutagenesis have suggested increased deamination rate in DNA, this study has used a purified system to confirm other in vivo and in vitro analyses that have shown that methylated CpG sites react more readily with carcinogens. In addition, data has been presented that provides support for the hypothesis that the mechanism that causes this phenomenon is a structural change afforded by the presence of the methylated cytosine 5′ to the modified guanine. Future studies will focus more closely on the nature of this structural change and the effect of these different structures on DNA repair and replication fidelity.

Pharmacol. 1976; 25: 2221-2225Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The (±)-anti-BPDE forms are thought to be the most biologically relevant (6Newbold R.F. Brookes P. Nature. 1976; 261: 52-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar), and these enantiomers display very different mutagenicities depending on the host system: the (−)-anti form is more mutagenic in bacteria, (7Wood A.W.

Bracken W.J. Gleason G. Levin W. Yagi H. Jerina D.M. Conney A.H. Cancer Res. 1979; 39: 67-71PubMed Google Scholar). Regardless of the stereochemistry of anti-BPDE, it is highly reactive, and the major adducts are formed by the cis or trans opening of the epoxide at the C-10 position by the exocyclic amine of guanine (10Weinstein I.B. Jeffrey A.M. Jennette K.W. Blobstein S.H. Harvey R.G. Harris C. Autrup H. Kasai H. Nakanishi K. Science. 1976; 193: 592-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar). The four major guanine adducts are shown in Fig. 1 A (11Cheng S.C. Hilton B.D. Roman J.M. Dipple A. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1989; 2: 334-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). BPDE also reacts to a lesser extent with the N-6 position of adenine (11Cheng S.C. Hilton B.D. Roman J.M. Dipple A. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1989; 2: 334-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar) residues to form similar enantiomeric mixtures. The (+)-trans-anti-B[a]P-dGuo adduct is the major form produced following either in vivo or in vitro treatment, and NMR solution studies have shown that this adduct resides in the minor groove of DNA pointing toward the 5′-end of the adducted DNA strand (12Cosman M. de los Santos C. Fiala R. Hingerty B.E. Singh S.B. Ibanez V. Margulis L.A. Live D. Geacintov N.E. Broyde S. Patel D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1914-1918Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). The (−)-trans adduct is also positioned in the minor groove but points in the 3′ direction (13de los Santos C. Cosman M. Hingerty B.E. Ibanez V. Margulis L.A. Geacintov N.E. Broyde S. Patel D.J.

Phosphodiesterase digestion of single-stranded DNA oligomers containing the trans adducts have also shown these same adduct orientations (14Mao B. Li B. Amin S. Cosman M. Geacintov N.E. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 11785-11793Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). NMR studies indicate that both of the cis isomers are more intercalated into the helix, with the (+)-cis pointing toward the minor groove and the (−)-cis isomers pointing toward the major groove (15Cosman M. de los Santos C.

https://openalex.org/W2030136627,"Gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP) and its amphibian homolog, bombesin, are potent secretogogues in mammals. We determined the roles of intracellular free Ca2+([Ca2+]i), protein kinase C (PKC), and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) in GRP receptor (GRP-R)-regulated secretion. Bombesin induced either [Ca2+]i oscillations or a biphasic elevation in [Ca2+]i. The biphasic response was associated with peptide secretion. Receptor-activated secretion was blocked by removal of extracellular Ca2+, by chelation of [Ca2+]i, and by treatment with inhibitors of phospholipase C, conventional PKC isozymes, and MAPK kinase (MEK). Agonist-induced increases in [Ca2+]i were also inhibited by dominant negative MEK-1 and the MEK inhibitor, PD89059, but not by an inhibitor of PKC. Direct activation of PKC by a phorbol ester activated MAPK and stimulated peptide secretion without a concomitant increase in [Ca2+]i. Inhibition of MEK blocked both bombesin- and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-induced secretion. GRP-R-regulated secretion is initiated by an increase in [Ca2+]i; however, elevated [Ca2+]i is insufficient to stimulate secretion in the absence of activation of PKC and the downstream MEK/MAPK pathways. We demonstrated that the activity of MEK is important for maintaining elevated [Ca2+]i levels induced by GRP-R activation, suggesting that MEK may affect receptor-regulated secretion by modulating the activity of Ca2+-sensitive PKC.

Brown M. Rivier J.E. Peptides. 1981; 2: 169-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), smooth muscle contractility (2Ladenheim E.E. Moore K.A. Salorio C.F. Mantey S.A. Taylor J.E. Coy D.H. Eur.

Biol. 1997; 16: 259-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), and exocrine and endocrine processes. Many of the biological effects attributed to the amphibian peptide, BBS, and its mammalian homolog gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP) are a consequence of their potent secretory activity and occur secondarily to the release of other peptide hormones. For example, in the small intestine, the effects of BBS on smooth muscle contraction are partially due to BBS-induced secretion of motilin from intestinal M-cells (4Poitras P. Trudel L. Miller P. Gu C.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: G4-G9PubMed Google Scholar). In isolated muscle strips from the lower esophageal sphincter of rabbits, BBS-induced muscle contractions are blocked by substance-P receptor antagonists, suggesting that substance-P is the direct mediator of contractions in this preparation (5Kohjitani A. Shirakawa J. Okada S. Obara H. Peptides. 1996; 17: 927-931Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). In the stomach, BBS stimulates gastric acid secretion from parietal cells indirectly by stimulating gastrin release from stomach G-cells (6Weigert N. Li Y.Y. Lippl F. Coy D.H. Classen M. Schusdziarra V. Neuropeptides. 1996; 30: 521-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar, 7Kovacs T.O. Lloyd K.C. Wong H. Walsh J.H. Am J. Physiol. 1995; 268: G54-G58PubMed Google Scholar). BBS-stimulated secretion also plays a role in the proliferation of some tumors of the lung (8Cuttitta F. Carney D.N. Mulshine J. Moody T.W. Fedorko J. Fischler A. Minna J.D. Nature. 1985; 316: 823-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (1150) Google Scholar) and stomach (9Bold R.J. Lowry P.S. Ishizuka J. Battey J.F. Townsend Jr., C.M. Thompson J.C. J. Cell. Physiol. 1994; 161: 519-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) by participating in autocrine and/or paracrine growth loops. Despite the important role of BBS-stimulated secretion in many normal and pathophysiological processes, little is known about the intracellular signal transduction pathways regulating this activity. A family of G-protein-coupled receptors mediates the actions of BBS. Three BBS receptor subtypes have been cloned and characterized in humans: 1) gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP)-preferring receptors (GRP-R), 2) neuromedin B-preferring receptors, and 3) the bombesin receptor subtype 3 (10Kroog G.S. Jensen R.T. Battey J.F. Med. Res. Rev. 1995; 15: 389-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Agonist binding to GRP-R stimulates phospholipase C-β (PLC-β) resulting in the production of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and diacylglycerol (DAG), an increase in the concentration of free cytosolic Ca2+([Ca2+]i), and the activation of both protein kinase C (PKC) (11Li G.

Van Obberghen E. Chayvialle J.A. Abello J. Biochem. J. 1998; 331: 129-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). To investigate the role of these pathways in BBS-induced peptide secretion, we developed a human neuroendocrine-like cell line that expresses recombinant human GRP-R, called BON/GRP-R. The parental BON cell line was derived from a human metastatic carcinoma tumor of the pancreas (15Evers B.M. Townsend Jr., C.M. Upp J.R. Allen E. Hurlbut S.C. Kim S.W. Rajaraman S. Singh P. Reubi J.C. Thompson J.C. Gastroenterology. 1991; 101: 303-311Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). BON and BON/GRP-R cells exhibit morphological and biochemical characteristics consistent with the phenotype of a neuroendocrine cell, including the presence of numerous dense-core granules and the expression and secretion of chromogranin-A (CGA), neurotensin (NT), serotonin, and pancreastatin (16Parekh D. Ishizuka J. Townsend Jr., C.M. Haber B. Beauchamp R.D. Karp G. Kim S.W. Rajaraman S. Greeley Jr., G.H. Thompson J.C. Pancreas. 1994; 9: 83-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 17Jeng Y.J. Townsend Jr., C.M. Nagasawa S. Chuo S. Kern K. Yanaihara N. Ferrar R.S. Hill F.L. Thompson J.C. Greeley Jr., G.H. Endocrinology. 1991; 128: 220-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Unlike primary cultures of canine gastric G-cells, which have been used by others to examine BBS-induced secretion (7Kovacs T.O. Lloyd K.C. Wong H. Walsh J.H. Am J. Physiol. 1995; 268: G54-G58PubMed Google Scholar), BON/GRP-R can be maintained in long term culture without noticeable changes in their secretory activity. In addition, they have a lower level of constitutive or spontaneous peptide release compared with the glucagonoma cell line, STC-1. Using BON/GRP-R cells and a combination of single cell calcium imaging, whole cell voltage clamp, radioimmunoassay (RIA), and the reverse hemolytic plaque assay (RHPA), we have determined the roles of agonist-induced increases in [Ca2+]i, PKC, and MAPK pathways in GRP-R-regulated exocytosis. We have found that GRP-R-activated secretion requires a sustained elevation in [Ca2+]i that is initiated by Ca2+ release from intracellular stores and maintained by Ca2+ influx across the plasma membrane and through the activity of MEK-mediated pathways. However, an agonist-induced increase in [Ca2+]i will not stimulate secretion without activation of PKC and the subsequent activation of downstream MAPK/ERK. MEK regulation of [Ca2+]i suggests that this kinase pathway may affect receptor-regulated secretion, in part, by modulating the activity of Ca2+-sensitive PKC through a feedback loop mechanism. BON cells, stably transfected with a human gastrin-releasing peptide receptor cDNA (GRP-R), were grown at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2in DMEM/F12K (1:1) medium supplemented with 5% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS) and Geneticin (G-418, 400 μg/ml). Real-time recording of [Ca2+]i was performed in single BON/GRP-R cells using methods described previously (18Tsien R.Y. Haroorunian A.T. Cell Calcium. 1990; 11: 93-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Cells were plated on glass coverslips (25 mm) at a density of approximately 1.5–3 × 105 cells/coverslip, cultured for 48 h, washed with KRH (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 125 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1.2 KH2PO4, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 2 mm CaCl2, 6 mm glucose), and loaded with 2 μm fura-2AM (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) for 50 min at 25 °C. Loaded cells were washed three times with KRH and incubated in KRH plus 0.1% bovine serum albumin for 60 min at 25 °C in the dark. Cells were challenged with various concentrations of BBS and imaged using a Nikon Diaphot inverted microscope (Garden City, NY). The microscope was coupled to a dual monochromator system via a fiber optic cable (Photon Technology International (PTI), South Brunswick, NJ). Fluorescence was detected using an intensified charged coupled device camera (Dage-MTI, Inc., Michigan City, IN) and images processed using ImageMaster software (PTI). BON/GRP-R cells (5 × 105 cells/well) were plated into six-well culture plates (Falcon Labware) in culture medium consisting of DMEM/F12K (1:1) supplemented with 5% FBS and 400 μg/ml G-418. After 48 h, cells (8 × 105cells/well) were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and treated with bombesin (BBS) (10−10m to 10−6m), diluted in KRH, at room temperature. Following BBS treatment, the NT or CGA content of the medium was determined by RIA as described previously (19Zhang T. Townsend Jr., C.M. Udupi V. Yanaihara N. Rajaraman S. Beauchamp R.D. Ishizuka J. Evers B.M. Gomez G. Thompson J.C. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 2252-2261Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 20Doyle H. Greeley Jr., G.H. Mate L. Sakamoto T. Townsend Jr., C.M. Thompson J.C. Surgery. 1985; 97: 337-341PubMed Google Scholar). The NT antiserum was generated in rabbits using full-length porcine NT as antigen. CGA antiserum was produced in rabbits using synthetic rat CGA (amino acid residues 359–389) linked to bovine serum albumin as antigen. The sensitivities and ID50 values for the NT RIA and CGA RIA were 100 pg/ml and 1 ng/ml and 40 fmol/ml and 0.4 pmol/ml, respectively. RHPA assays were preformed as described previously (21Childs G.V. Unabia G. Burke J.A. Marchetti C. Am. J. Physiol. 1987; 252: E347-E356PubMed Google Scholar) and modified to allow the simultaneous measurement of [Ca2+]i with fura-2 (22Malgaroli A. Milani D. Meldolesi J. Pozzan T. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 2145-2155Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). Cells were cultured, loaded with fura-2AM and washed as described above (see “Calcium Imaging”). Before making [Ca2+]i measurements, BON/GRP-R cells were overlaid with solution containing 2% ovine red blood cells conjugated to protein A and anti-CGA antiserum. Single-cell fluorescence measurements were obtained from 20–40 cells/coverslip. Averaged image frames were acquired every 1–8 s, and graphical representations of single-cell ratio values (340/380 nm) were generated using ImageMaster software (PTI). After [Ca2+]i measurements were complete, complement was added to the cells and cells were incubated at room temperature for 1–2 h. Plaque formation was recorded by photographing cells at 0, 1, and 2 h after addition of complement. Data comparing the effects of various pharmacological agents or a dominant negative mutant of MEK-1 were expressed as a percentage of the number of plaques formed by treatment with BBS for 1 h ± S.E. from at least three separate experiments. For all experiments, 600–1000 cells were counted per treatment group. Approximately 3% of the cells exhibited spontaneous peptide secretion. Stimulated secretion was detected in 17–20% of the cells. For evaluation of the effect of various treatments on secretion, statistical analysis was performed using a one-way analysis of variance and Tukey-Kramer multiple comparison test. Statistical significance was assumed for a P value of <0.01. Cells growing on coverslips were mounted in a Leiden chamber and positioned on the stage of an inverted Nikon Diaphot phase contrast microscope. Patch pipettes were pulled from 1.65-mm (outer diameter) borosilicate glass on a Sutter Instruments P87 horizontal puller. Pipette DC resistance measured 5–7 megohms. Recordings were made using an Axon Instruments Axopatch 200A amplifier, and data were collected using Pclamp (version 6; Axon Instruments). Internal solution consisted of 140 mm KC1, 2 mmMgCl2, 0.2 mm CaCl2, 2 mm BAPTA, 11 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, with KOH. Drugs were applied to single cells using a Picospritzer (General Valve Corp.). Changes in membrane potential necessary to activate voltage-dependent conductances were achieved by either step depolarizations or ramp protocols. BON/GRP-R cells were plated onto 100-mm culture dishes (1 × 106cells/plate) in DMEM/F12K (1:1) supplemented with 5% heat-inactivated FBS and 400 μg/ml G-418. Two days later, cells were pretreated with various agents and then stimulated with BBS for 5 min. The media were removed by decanting, and the cells were lysed with 1 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40 detergent, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm dithioerythritol, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate), scraped, and incubated on ice for 1 h. Non-soluble cell material was removed by centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 15 min. The protein content of the supernatant was determined by the Bradford method using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Cell extracts (10 μg of protein) were resolved on 10% polyacrylamide gels and electrophoretically transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride (Millipore, Milford, MA) membranes as described previously (23Ethridge R.T. Hellmich M.R. DuBois R.N. Evers B.M. Gastroenterology. 1998; 115: 1454-1463Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). polyvinylidene difluoride membranes were blocked for 2 h with 5% dried skimmed milk in Tris-buffered saline (TBS) (20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl) and then incubated for 3 h with anti-active MAPK antibody (pTEpY) (Promega, Madison, WI) diluted 1:4000 in 5% milk/TBS. Between primary and secondary antibodies, membranes were washed three times with TBS plus 0.05% Tween 20 detergent. The secondary antibody was a donkey anti-rabbit IgG coupled to horseradish peroxidase and diluted 1:5000 in 5% milk/TBS. Specific immunostaining was detected using a chemiluminescent detection reagent (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). BBS stimulation of BON/GRP-R cells generally produced two distinct [Ca2+]i responses: biphasic or oscillatory. The frequency with which each calcium response was observed depended partially on the concentration of BBS (TableI). Greater than 99% of the cells responded to BBS stimulation at all concentrations tested. At high concentrations of BBS (≥10−8m), 100% of the responding cells displayed a biphasic calcium response (Fig.1 A) characterized by an initial rapid increase in [Ca2+]ifollowed by a second sustained elevation in [Ca2+]i that slowly declined to resting levels over a period of 10–20 min. The predominant calcium response at lower concentrations of BBS (≤10−10m) was an oscillatory increase in [Ca2+]i lasting approximately 15–30 s with a spike frequency ranging from 0.4 to 1.3 transients per min (Fig. 1 B). Between each transient, [Ca2+]i generally returned to a level slightly elevated above resting levels. BBS stimulation also induced a single [Ca2+]i spike in a small percentage of cells (2–8%) (Fig. 1 C). Like the oscillatory response, the single spike response only occurred at lower concentrations of BBS (Table I).Table IThe effect of BBS [Ca2+]i concentration on the occurrence (%) of different [Ca2+]i responses in BON/GRP-R19 cellsResponse[BBS] Log10−1110−1010−910−810−710−6mBiphasic304257100100100Oscillations655635000Monophasic528000Total no. of cellsn = 130n = 203n = 49n = 50n = 23n = 99 Open table in a new tab Both the biphasic and oscillatory calcium responses were dependent on the presence of extracellular Ca2+. Replacing the normal KRH solution with a solution that did not contain added Ca2+ and included 1 mm EGTA terminated the biphasic and oscillatory [Ca2+]i responses (Fig.2, A and B). The biphasic response was immediately attenuated following removal of extracellular Ca2+, whereas oscillating cells showed a slowing of the spike frequency, followed by complete cessation of the calcium response within 10 min. Addition of lanthanum (La3+) blocked agonist-induced [Ca2+]i oscillations in a concentration-dependent fashion (Fig. 2, C and D). Lanthanum blocks Ca2+ influx through the plasma membrane (24Rottingen J.A. Camerer E. Mathiesen I. Prydz H. Iversen J.G. Cell Calcium. 1997; 21: 195-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) and inhibits the activity of the plasma membrane Ca2+-dependent ATPase (25Shimizu H. Borin M.L. Blaustein M.P. Cell Calcium. 1997; 21: 31-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). It is also the most potent metal ion to block the sodium-calcium exchanger in vesicle systems (26Beaugé L. DiPolo R. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1991; 639: 147-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) and in the squid axon (27Baker P.F. Blaustein M.P. Hodgkin A.L. Steinhardt R.A. J. Physiol. 1969; 200: 431-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar). A low concentration of La3+ (0.2 mm) caused a slowing of the spike frequency, whereas a higher concentration (1.0 mm) completely abolished BBS-induced increases in [Ca2+]i. Whole cell voltage clamp experiments with BON/GRP-R cells revealed an inward current that was activated near −40 mV and peaked near −5 mV (data not shown). This current was slowly inactivating and similar to that seen during activation of L-type voltage-gated Ca2+channels. These channels, however, are unlikely candidates for agonist-induced Ca2+ influx because BBS failed to depolarize BON/GRP-R cells, a requirement for activation of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels. There was no effect of BBS application on BON/GRP-R cell membrane conductance compared with measurements just before and after agonist stimulation. Consistent with these experiments, nifedipine, a blocker of L-type voltage-gated Ca2+ channels, did not affect either BBS-induced [Ca2+]i oscillation or biphasic responses (data not shown). In the presence of extracellular Ca2+ (2 mm), maximum release of CGA and NT occurred at BBS concentrations of 10−8m and above (Fig.3, A and B, closed circles). In the absence of extracellular Ca2+, BBS failed to stimulate detectable release of either CGA or NT at all concentrations of agonist tested (Fig. 3, A and B, open circles). Addition of 10−7m BBS caused a time-dependent increase in CGA and NT secretion that reached a maximum at approximately 30 and 15 min, respectively (Fig. 3, C and D). The time course of peptide release was consistent with the long duration of biphasic calcium response observed at higher concentrations of BBS. In contrast, treatment with a low concentration of BBS (10−10m), which induced predominantly [Ca2+]i oscillations (Table I), produced only a small increase in NT secretion (Fig. 3 D, open circles). To investigate the relationship between specific patterns of change in [Ca2+]i and peptide secretion from individual cells, we used a combination of fura-2 imaging and RHPA. BON/GRP-R cells were stimulated with 10−10mBBS; intracellular Ca2+ oscillations were recorded in 152 individual cells. When we compared [Ca2+]i records with the results of the RHPA, we found no detectable secretion of CGA from cells exhibiting [Ca2+]i oscillation up to 2 h after stimulation (Fig.4 A). When [Ca2+]i records from individual cells stimulated with 10−7m BBS were compared with RHPA data, all cells that developed plaques (about 20% of the total cells) exhibited a biphasic [Ca2+]i response (Fig.4 B, n = 79). Similar results were obtained when NT secretion was compared with [Ca2+]i (data not shown). To determine whether cells exhibiting [Ca2+]i oscillations were secretion-competent, we identified oscillating cells and showed that, after 1 h of continuous exposure to BBS (10−10m), there was no plaque formation by RHPA. When cells were restimulated with 10−7m BBS and incubated an additional 1 h, plaques formed around the cells previously exhibiting [Ca2+]i oscillations, indicating that these cells were capable of peptide secretion in the presence of sufficient agonist (data not shown). Pretreatment of BON/GRP-R19 cells with either the PLC inhibitor, U73122 (1 μm), or the acetoxymethyl ester form of the Ca2+ chelator, BAPTA (30 μm), completely blocked BBS-stimulated increases in [Ca2+]i (Fig.5 A) and peptide secretion (Fig. 5 B). These data demonstrate that BBS-stimulated peptide secretion is dependent on an increase in [Ca2+]i, which is initiated by an inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate-induced Ca2+ release from intracellular stores. To determine whether Ca2+ released from intracellular stores was sufficient to stimulate secretion, we treated BON/GRP-R19 cells with thapsigargin. Thapsigargin is an irreversible inhibitor of the microsomal Ca2+-ATPase reuptake pump that is responsible for maintaining intracellular Ca2+ stores. Application of thapsigargin to BON/GRP-R cells in the absence of extracellular cellular Ca2+ induced a transient increase in [Ca2+]i (Fig.6 A, Ca2+-free) and did not stimulate secretion (Fig.6 B, Thaps (Ca2+ free). Bombesin stimulation (10−7m), in the absence of extracellular Ca2+, produced a similar [Ca2+]i profile and also failed to induce secretion (data not shown). In contrast, thapsigargin treatment of cells bathed in 2 mm extracellular Ca2+induced both a sustained increase in [Ca2+]i (Fig. 6 A, 2 mm Ca2+) and CGA secretion (Fig. 6 B, 2 mmCa2+). These data demonstrate that release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores, in the absence of an influx of extracellular Ca2+, is insufficient to stimulate peptide secretion. To further evaluate the role of store-released Ca2+ in GRP-R-activated secretion, BON/GRP-R cells were pretreated with thapsigargin for 10 min in Ca2+-free media in order to deplete the intracellular Ca2+ stores. Following thapsigargin treatment, the bath solution was replaced with KRH containing 2 mm Ca2+ and after a 20-min recovery, the cells were overlaid with ovine red blood cells and stimulated with BBS (10−7m). Fig.6 C shows the effects of thapsigargin pretreatment, addition of extracellular Ca2+, and BBS stimulation on the [Ca2+]i record. Bombesin failed to induce either an increase in [Ca2+]i (Fig. 6 C) or CGA secretion (Fig. 6 B, Thaps + BBS) from cells in which the intracellular Ca2+ stores were depleted by pretreatment with thapsigargin. Together, these data suggest that GRP-R-mediated Ca2+ release from intracellular stores is necessary but not sufficient to stimulate secretion. Agonist-induced Ca2+ release from intracellular stores appears to be necessary to initiate Ca2+ influx across the plasma membrane, which in turn provides the sustained elevation in [Ca2+]i required for activation of the receptor-regulated secretory machinery. Previous studies have shown that GRP-R is coupled to the activation of both PKC and MAPK/ERK pathways; however, the role of these kinases in GRP-R-regulated secretion is not well defined. Direct activation of PKC with the phorbol ester, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), stimulated secretion of CGA from BON/GRP-R cells (Fig. 7 A, 1 μmPMA) without increasing [Ca2+]i (Fig. 7 B, 1 μm PMA). PMA also induced MAPK/ERK activation (Fig. 7 C, lane 7). The MEK inhibitor PD98059 inhibited PMA-stimulated secretion and MAPK/ERK activation in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.8, A and B). These data indicate that PMA-sensitive PKC is upstream of MEK and the regulation of peptide secretion in BON/GRP-R cells.Figure 8The MEK inhibitor, PD98059, blocks PMA-induced secretion (A) and ERK activation (B). A, BON/GRP-R cells were pretreated for 4 min with different concentrations of PD98059 (25, 50, and 100 μm) and then stimulated with PMA (1 μm). The effects of PD98059 on secretion are expressed as a percentage of plaque-forming cells in 1 h ± S.E. *, p < 0.01 versus BBS.

DMSO, Me2SO.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To investigate whether PKC was coupled to GRP-R-regulated secretion, cells were pretreated with the PKC inhibitor, GF109203X (GFX) (5 μm), and stimulated with BBS. Pretreatment with GFX completely blocked BBS-stimulated CGA release (Fig. 7 A, GFX + BBS) and MAPK/ERK activation (Fig. 7 C, lane 6), but did not effect BBS-induced increases in [Ca2+]i(Fig. 7 B, 5 μ m GFX). These data demonstrate that blocking PKC activation is sufficient to block BBS-induced secretion and MAPK/ERK activation in BON/GRP-R cells even in the presence of an increase in [Ca2+]i, suggesting that one role for BBS-induced increases in [Ca2+]i is to activate Ca2+-sensitive PKC isozymes. To further investigate the role of MEK-mediated pathways in GRP-R-regulated secretion, BON/GRP-R cells were treated with the MEK inhibitor, PD98059. As expected, PD98059 blocked BBS-induced MAPK/ERK activation (Fig. 7 C, lane 5) and caused a dose-dependent inhibition of CGA secretion (Fig.9 A). However, in contrast to the PKC inhibitor (GFX), which did not affect agonist-induced changes in [Ca2+]i, PD98059 induced a dose-dependent inhibition of BBS-stimulated increases in [Ca2+]i (Fig. 9 B). To evaluate the specificity of the PD98059 effect, BON/GRP-R cells were transfected with either a vector construct containing a dominant negative mutant form of MEK-1 (MEK-2A-EECMV; Dr. Dennis J. Templeton, Case Western Reserve University) or the empty expression vector EECMV. Like PD98059, the dominant negative MEK-1 blocked BBS-stimulated increases in [Ca2+]i (Fig.9 C, dnMEK-1). Transfection of the empty expression vector had no effect on BBS-induced [Ca2+]i responses (Fig.9 C, Vector). Together, these data demonstrate a novel role for MEK-mediated pathways in the maintenance of agonist-induced increases in [Ca2+]i and suggest that MEK modulates GRP-R-regulated exocytosis, in part, by affecting the activity of Ca2+-sensitive PKC. An important trigger of receptor-regulated secretion is an agonist-induced increase in [Ca2+]i (28Tse A. Tse F.W. Almers W. Hille B.

CBF-C/NF-YC directly bound to c-Myc in vitro and in vivo in cultured cells. The CBF/NF-Y·c-Myc complex required the HSP-MYC-B element as well as CCAAT in the hsp70 G1-enhancer, while the purified CBF subunits recognized only CCAAT even in the presence of c-Myc. Both the HSP-MYC-B and CCAAT elements were also required for the enhancer activity. In transient transfection experiments, the CBF/NF-Y·c-Myc complex, as well as transcription due to the G1-enhancer, was increased by the introduction of c-Myc at low doses but decreased at high doses. The repression of both complex formation and transcription by c-Myc at high doses was abrogated by the introduction of CBF/NF-Y in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, the CBF/NF-Y·c-Myc complex bound to the G1-enhancer appeared in the early G1 phase of the cell cycle when c-Myc was not higly expressed and gradually disappeared after the c-Myc expression reached its maximum.

Chinese hamster ovary GAL4 DNA-binding domain glutathione S-transferase maltose-binding protein The human heat shock 70 (hsp70) gene is induced by various stresses, including heat shock (for reviews, see Refs. 1Mayer M.P.

Bioessays. 1989; 11: 48-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Without stress, the hsp70 gene is expressed in a cell cycle-dependent manner, namely in the G1 and the S phases (4Wu B.J.

In addition to the heat shock element, several transcriptional regulatory elements, including the sites for Sp1, AP2, ATF, and CTF, have been found to contribute to a basal level of hsp70 gene expression in the hsp70 gene promoter region. CTF is a CCAAT box-binding protein, and two CCAAT boxes are present in the hsp70 gene promoter, at about −150 and −90 from the transcription start site (8Wu B.J. Hurst H.C. Jones N.C. Morimoto R.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 2994-2999Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Not only CTF (9Morgan W.D. Williams G.T. Morimoto R.I. Greene J. Kingston R.E. Tjian R. Mol. Cell.

The hsp70 gene expression is also induced by several oncogenes, including c-myc (11Kingston R.E. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Sharp P.A.

Although the precise mechanisms of the regulation by these oncogenes have not been clarified, p53, Myb, and E1A have been reported to regulate the hsp70 gene expression by interacting with other proteins that directly bind to the respective transcriptional elements in the hsp70 gene promoter (18Lum L.S. Hsu S. Vaewhongs M. Wu B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2599-2605Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Both E1A and p53 competitively bind to the CBF of 114 kDa to stimulate and repress the hsp70 promoter activity (19Agoff S.N. Hou J. Linzer D.I. Wu B. Science. 1993; 259: 84-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Up-regulation of the gene by c-myc has been reported in Drosophila and humans, and the region involved in the regulation was identified to be from −120 to −1,250 in the human hsp70 promoter (11Kingston R.E. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Sharp P.A. Nature. 1984; 312: 280-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 12Kaddurah-Daouk R. Greene J.M. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Kingston R.E. Genes Dev. 1987; 1: 347-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). We have identified two sequences bound by c-Myc complexes in this region and termed them HSP-MYC-A (from −232 to −226) and HSP-MYC-B (from −157 to −151) (20Taira T. Negishi Y. Kihara F. Iguchi-Ariga S.M.M. Ariga H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1130: 166-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). HSP-MYC-B is adjacent to an inverted CCAAT box and one nucleotide is overlapped. Both HSP-MYC-A and HSP-MYC-B functioned as an origin of DNA replication, and the plasmids carrying both or either of the sequences worked as an autonomous replicating plasmid (21Taira T. Iguchi-Ariga S.M.M. Ariga H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6386-6397Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Of the two sequences, only HSP-MYC-B showed a transcriptional enhancer activity which contributed to the G1-specific expression of hsp70 in the cell cycle (7Taira T. Narita T. Iguchi-Ariga S.M.M. Ariga H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 1975-1983Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). This enhancer function of HSP-MYC-B was confirmed by another group (22Lin H. Head M. Blank M. Han L. Jin M. Goodman R. J. Cell. Biochem. 1998; 169: 181-188Crossref Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The c-Myc complexe was therefore thought to be involved in the cell cycle-dependent expression of the hsp70 gene. In this study, we have verified the association of c-Myc with CBF/NF-Y, CCAAT-binding proteins, and the involvement of the c-Myc·CBF/NF-Y complex formed on the HSP-MYC-B element in the regulation of hsp70 expression. pACT-CBF-C was obtained from one-hybrid plasmids followed by two-hybrid screening targeting the HSP-MYC-B and C-Myc binding activities. For pCMV-CBF-C, pGEX-CBF-C, and pMBP-CBF-C, the Eco RI-Xho I fragment of pACT-CBF-C was inserted into the Eco RI-Xho I site of pcDNA3 (Invitrogen), pGEX-5X-1 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and pMAL-6P-1, 1T.

The pCMV-CBF-A, -B, pGEX-CBF-A, -B, and pMBP-CBF-A, -B of the Bgl II-Xho I fragment of pACT-CBF-A, -B was inserted into the Bam HI-Xho I site of pcDNA3, pGEX-5X-1, and pMAL-6P-1, respectively. pCMV-GAL4-CBF-A, B, and C of the Hin dIII-Bam HI fragment of pGBT9 (CLONTECH) and Bgl II-Xho I fragment of pACT-CBF-A, B, and C, respectively, were inserted into the Hin dIII-Xho I sites of pcDNA3.

The polymerase chain reaction contained 10 ng of pACT-CBF-C, 10 pmol each of the primers, and 2.5 units of Taq polymerase (Nippongene). The reactions were carried out for the first 5 min at 94 °C, and then for 30 cycles of 1 min at 94 °C followed by 2 min at 55 °C, and finally for 3 min at 72 °C.

The tetramerized elements, 4xwtB, were inserted into the Sac I-Sal I sites of pUC19 (pUC-4xwtB). The Hin dIII site of pUC-4xwtB was changed to Xba I by linker insertion, and the Eco RI-Xba I fragment of this plasmid containing 4xwtB was inserted into the respective site of pHISi. pLacZi-4xwtB, the Eco RI-Sal I fragment of pUC-4xwtB, was inserted into the respective site of pLacZi. pHISi-4xwtB was digested with Kpn I to be linearized, and integrated to the chromosome in Saccharomyces cerevisiae YM4271 by Ura selection. pLacZi-4xwtB was digested with Apa I and integrated to the chromosome in S. cerevisiae YM4271 by Ura selection. These two yeast strains were used for one-hybrid screening for His selection and β-galactosidase assay.

One μg of GST-CBF-C/NF-YC or GST was first applied to glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 40 mm NaCl, 1% glycerol, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.5 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, and about 50 μg of proteins in the Raji cell extract was then applied to the column and washed with the buffer (20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 25 mm NaCl, 1% glycerol, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 50 μg/ml bovine serum albumin). The proteins recovered from the resin were separated in a 7.5% polyacrylamide gel containing SDS, blotted onto a nitrocellulose filter, and reacted with a mouse anti-c-Myc antibody (C33, Santa Cruz). About 10 mg of proteins from Raji cells was first immunoprecipitated with a rabbit anti-CBF-A/NF-YB, -B/-A (Rockland), or C antibody, or nonspecific mouse IgG. The binding reactions for immunoprecipitation of c-Myc and CBF/NF-Y were carried out in a buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, 5 mmEDTA, 50 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 150 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.25% Nonidet P-40. After washing with the same buffer except for 0.05% Nonidet P-40 instead of 0.25%, the precipitates were separated on a 15 or 7.5% polyacrylamide gel containing SDS, blotted onto a nitrocellulose filter, and reacted with the rabbit anti-CBF-C/NF-YC antibody or a mouse anti-c-Myc antibody (C33, Santa Cruz), respectively. Two μg of a reporter plasmid and 1 μg of CMV-β-gal, a β-galactosidase expression vector, were transfected to cells approximately 60% confluent in a 6-cm dish by the standard calcium phosphate method (29Graham F.J. Van der Eb A.J. Virology. 1973; 52: 456-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (6499) Google Scholar). Two days after transfection, whole cell extracts were prepared by addition of the Triton X-100-containing solution from the Pica gene kit (Wako Pure Chemicals Co. Ltd., Kyoto, Japan) to the cells. About a one-fifth volume of the extract was used for β-galactosidase assay to normalize the transfection efficiency as described previously (7Taira T. Narita T. Iguchi-Ariga S.M.M. Ariga H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 1975-1983Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), and the luciferase activity due to the reporter plasmid was determined using the Pica gene kit and a luminometer, Luminocounter ATP300 (Advantec Toyo Co. Ltd., Tokyo). The same experiments were repeated 5–10 times. CHO cells were transfected with 2 μg of effector plasmids, expressing the wild type or mutants of CBF/NF-Y and c-Myc fused to GALBD or VP16, in addition to 1 μg of pCMV-β-gal and 1 μg of pH17-MX-Luc-Luc, and followed by luciferase assay as described previously (24Mori K.

Preparation of nuclear extracts and bandshift assays were carried out as described previously (20Taira T. Negishi Y. Kihara F. Iguchi-Ariga S.M.M. Ariga H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1130: 166-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The c-Myc-containing complex formed on the HSP-MYC-B element was suggested to be responsible for the G1-specific enhancer activity of the element, but c-Myc did not directly bind to the element (20Taira T. Negishi Y. Kihara F. Iguchi-Ariga S.M.M. Ariga H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1130: 166-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). We thus planned to first clone proteins that directly bind to HSP-MYC-B, and then to select one that associates with c-Myc. Since the wtB oligonucleotide, 5′-CTGGCCTCTGATTGG-3′, containing the HSP-MYC-B showed a strong enhancer activity (Ref. 12Kaddurah-Daouk R. Greene J.M. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Kingston R.E. Genes Dev. 1987; 1: 347-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar; Fig. 9), tetramerized wtB was used as a targeting sequence for the one-hybrid screening. After introducing pHISi-4xwtB to S. cerevisiae to integrate in yeast genome, the human brain cDNA library in pACT2 was applied to the transformant, and the yeast were cultured in His(−) media. Among the approximately 4 × 106 clones tested, more than 100 His-positive clones were obtained and subjected to β-galactosidase assays. Plasmid DNAs were extracted from the 12 β-galactosidase-positive clones and used for re-transforming the S. cerevisiae SFY526 previously transformed with pGBT9-c-myc (30Taira T. Maëda J. Onishi T. Kitaura H. Yoshida S. Kato H. Ikeda M. Tamai K. Iguchi-Ariga S.M.M. Ariga H. Genes Cells. 1998; 3: 549-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The double transformants surviving in His(−) media were then tested for β-galactosidase activity to see the interaction with c-Myc fused to the GALBD. Finally, 12 clones were obtained and these were classified into two groups, tentatively named as HSM-1 and HSM-2. Through the BLAST search of their nucleic acid sequences, HSM-1 was identified as a human homologue of rat NF-YC/CBF-C (31Sinha S. Maity S.N. Lu J. de Crombrugghe B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1624-1628Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar), while HSM-2 was a novel gene that encodes a protein with slight homology to NF-YC/CBF-C. We further characterized HSM-1, i.e. the human CBF-C/NF-YC, in this study. CBF/NF-Y is a CCAAT-binding protein with three subunits of CBF, CBF-A, CBF-B, and CBF-C, which correspond to NF-YB, NF-YA, and NF-YC, respectively. The rat, mouse, and human cDNAs for CBF-A, CBF-B, and CBF-C cDNAs have already been cloned (31Sinha S. Maity S.N. Lu J. de Crombrugghe B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Among the three subunits of CBF/NF-Y, CBF-B/NF-YA directly recognizes the CCAAT sequence, not by itself but in the complex of the three subunits (23Sinha S. Kim I.S. Sohn K.Y. de Crombrugghe B.

The cDNA for human CBF-C/NF-YC was cloned in this study as HSM-1 in the screening of HSP-MYC-B-binding proteins, probably because the wtB probe used in the one-hybrid screening contained an inverted CCAAT in addition to the HSP-MYC-B element, and yeast homologues of CBF-B/NF-YA and CBF-A/NF-YB (HAP-2 and HAP-4, respectively) may complement the respective human homologues to sustain the binding activity of the cloned CBF-C/NF-YC to the wtB probe as described previously (40Becker D.M. Fikes J.D. Guarente L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 1968-1972Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). The HSM-1 cDNA we cloned contained 1,381 nucleotides, with several variations compared with those in the human CBF-C/NF-YC cloned by Bellorini et al. (41Bellorini M. Zemzoumi K. Farina A. Berthelsen J. Piaggio G. Mantovani R. Gene (Amst.). 1997; 193: 119-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar), and encoded exactly the same 335 amino acids as the human CBF-C/NF-YC. As in the case of CBF-A/NF-YB and CBF-B/NF-YA, only two amino acids were different between human and rat CBF-C. The expression of human CBF-C/NF-YC in human tissues was examined by Northern blot analyses. The results revealed that CBF-C/NF-YC was expressed almost ubiquitously in all the human tissues tested (data not shown), as reported previously (41Bellorini M. Zemzoumi K. Farina A. Berthelsen J. Piaggio G. Mantovani R. Gene (Amst.). 1997; 193: 119-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). To verify the interaction between CBF-C/NF-YC and c-Myc, in vitro binding assays were carried out using CBF-C purified as fused to glutathione S-transferase (GST) and the human Raji cell extract containing c-Myc. Various deletion mutants of CBF-C as well as the wild type protein were expressed in E. coli as GST fusion proteins and purified. The fusion proteins and GST alone were, respectively, applied to a glutathione-Sepharose column, and the Raji cell extract was subsequently added to the same column. After extensive washing of the column, the proteins bound to GST-CBF-C, or GST alone, were blotted with a mouse anti-c-Myc monoclonal antibody (C-33, Santa Cruz) (Fig. 1 A). The anti-c-Myc antibody used did not react with the purified GST-CBF-C (Fig. 1 A, lane 2). c-Myc was detected only in the eluate with the fusion protein of wild type CBF-C (Fig. 1 A, lane 3). Neither deletion mutants of CBF-C nor GST alone bound to c-Myc (Fig. 1 A, lanes 4–9). The results suggest that CBF-C/NF-YC forms a complex with c-Myc, either directly or via other proteins in the Raji cell extract. Similar binding assays were carried out using antibodies against each subunit of CBF/NF-Y. Since the amino acid sequences of both CBF-A/NF-YB and CBF-B/NF-YA are identical in rat and human except for 2 amino acids, we used rat cDNAs for CBF-A and CBF-B (36Dmitrenko V. Garifulin O. Kavsan V. Gene. 1997; 197: 161-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar, 37Bellorini M. Lee D.K. Dantonel J.C. Zemzoumi K. Roeder R.G. Tora L. Mantovani R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 2174-2181Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), instead of the corresponding human cDNAs. Three subunits of CBF, as well as Max as a positive control interacting with c-Myc, were expressed in E. coli as fusion proteins with the maltose-binding protein (MBP) and purified by the affinity column containing maltose. The full-length c-myc cDNA was ligated to the MBP cDNA in a modified MBP expression vector, in which the recognition site for PreScission protease (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was introduced in the junction between MBP and an insert cDNA to express. The fusion protein MBP-c-Myc was first expressed in E. coli and purified by the maltose resin. The recombinant full-length c-Myc was then obtained by releasing MBP with PreScission protease and subjected to binding reactions. The full-length c-Myc bound to the E-box sequence together with Max (characterization of the recombinant c-Myc in full-length will be described elsewhere). The MBP fusion protein with either CBF subunits or Max, or MBP alone, was mixed with c-Myc and applied to the agarose resin coupled with a mouse anti-c-Myc monoclonal antibody (C-33, Santa Cruz) or nonspecific mouse IgG. The proteins bound or not to either of the antibody-coupled resins were analyzed by Western blotting with an anti-MBP antibody (Fig. 1 B). MBP-Max was recovered from the anti-c-Myc antibody-coupled resin (Fig.1 B, lane 1) but not from the resin with nonspecific IgG (Fig. 1 B, lane 2). Neither of the resins bound free MBP (Fig. 1 B, lanes 13 and 14). A little recovery of MBP-CBF-A from both resins indicated that CBF-A nonspecifically interacts with the resin (Fig. 1 B, lanes 4 and 5). MBP-CBF-C was detected in the eluate from the resin with the anti-c-Myc antibody but not with IgG (Fig. 1 B, lanes 10 and 11), while MBP-CBF-B was hardly recovered from either resin (Fig. 1 B, lanes 7 and 8). The results indicate that CBF-C/NF-YC directly binds to c-Myc in a specific manner. To examine the association of CBF/NF-Y with c-Myc in vivo, a mammalian two-hybrid assay was carried out. The wild type or various deletion mutants of c-Myc were fused to the VP16 transcriptional activation domain (VP16AD), and each subunit of CBF/NF-Y was fused to the GALBD. The constructs were transfected to hamster CHO cells in various combinations together with pHE17-MX-Luc, which contains 6xGAL4, and HTLV-1 promoter linked to the luciferase gene and luciferase assays were carried out (Fig. 2). With the wild type c-Myc, CBF-A and CBF-C stimulated luciferase activity, while CBF-B did not. c-Myc thus interacted in vivo with CBF-C, but not with CBF-B, in transfected CHO cells as well as in vitro. CBF-A was also suggested to interact with c-Myc in vivo, less strongly than CBF-C. The affinity difference between CBF-A and CBF-C was more significant in the interaction with c-Myc deletion mutants, as described below. Among the various c-Myc mutants examined, Δ177 and ΔM deleting both myc boxes-1 and -2 or the myc box-2 followed by the internal region, respectively, interacted strongly with CBF-C and weakly with CBF-A, but did not interact with CBF-B. Deletions in the C-terminal region of c-Myc, not only a big deletion in mutant N but also small deletions in mutants ΔHZ, ΔH1, and ΔZip, resulted in the loss of CBF binding activity. These results implied that the C-terminal region of c-Myc spanning amino acids 368–435 is required for the interaction with CBF-C/NF-YC, and additionally with CBF-A/NF-YB. The in vivo association between c-Myc and CBF/NF-Y was also examined by co-immunoprecipitation assays. A rabbit polyclonal anti-CBF-C antibody was prepared by GST-CBF-C as an immunogen. The antibody specifically detected CBF-C but not CBF-A or CBF-B in human, mouse, and rat cells (data not shown). The human Raji cell extract was first precipitated with the antibody against CBF-A, CBF-B (Rockland Inc.), or CBF-C, or with nonspecific IgG. The precipitates were separated in an SDS-polyacrylamide gel and blotted with an anti-c-Myc antibody (C-33, Santa Cruz) (Fig. 3). The 64-kDa c-Myc in the Raji extract was precipitated with the antibody against CBF-A, CBF-B, or CBF-C (Fig. 3, lanes 3–5), while the precipitate with nonspecific IgG did not contain the protein reacting with the anti-c-Myc antibody (Fig. 3, lane 2). The results indicated that c-Myc associates with all CBF subunits in vivo in human Raji cells. Since the three CBF subunits form a stable complex in vivo (23Sinha S. Kim I.S. Sohn K.Y. de Crombrugghe B. Maity S.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 328-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 38Kim I.S. Sinha S. de Crombrugghe B. Maity S.N. Mol. Cell.

Chem. 1996; 271: 28784-28791Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), c-Myc was thought to associate with the CBF·NF-Y complex in vivo. We have previously shown that a protein complex containing c-Myc bound to the HSP-MYC-B sequence (20Taira T. Negishi Y. Kihara F. Iguchi-Ariga S.M.M. Ariga H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1130: 166-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). To assess the involvement of CBF/NF-Y in the c-Myc complex on HSP-MYC-B, bandshift assays were carried out using specific antibodies. The Balb 3T3 nuclear extract was treated with an antibody against c-Myc (OM11–905, Genosys), CBF-A, -B (28Mantovani R. Pessara U. Tronche F. Li X.Y. Knapp A.M. Pasquali J.L. Benoist C. Mathis D. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3315-3322Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), or -C, prior to binding reactions with a labeled wtB oligonucleotide, and separated in a polyacrylamide gel (Fig. 4). In the absence of antibodies, two specific DNA-protein complexes, complexes I and II, were detected (Fig. 4, A and B, lane 2). The anti-c-Myc antibody abrogated the formation of both complexes, while neither complex was affected by IgG (Fig. 4 A, lanes 3–6). All three antibodies against CBF subunits impaired the formation of complex I but not of complex II (Fig. 4 B, lanes 5–10). CBF/NF-Y was thus suggested to be involved in c-Myc containing complex I on the wtB oligonucleotide, b"

We utilized point mutagenesis to investigate how each residue modulates H4B function. All mutants contained heme ligated to Cys-194 indicating no deleterious effect on general protein structure. Ala mutants were monomers except for W457A and did not form a homodimer with excess H4B and Arg. However, they did form heterodimers when paired with a full-length iNOS subunit, and these were either fully or partially active regarding NO synthesis, indicating that preserving residue identities or aromatic character is not essential for H4B binding or activity. Aromatic substitution at Trp-455 or Trp-457 generated monomers that could dimerize with H4B and Arg. These mutants bound Arg and H4B with near normal affinity, but Arg could not displace heme-bound imidazole, and they had NO synthesis activities lower than wild-type in both homodimeric and heterodimeric settings.

Mouse iNOSox that is overexpressed in bacteria is primarily dimeric as purified and can bind Arg and H4B with normal affinity. Moreover, iNOSox can synthesize NO from the reaction intermediate NOHA when reducing equivalents are provided by either free reductase domains (20Ghosh D.K. Abu-Soud H.M. Stuehr D.J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11316-11320Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) or dithionite 2S. Boggs, L. Huang, H. Abu-Soud, and D. J. Stuehr, unpublished results. and also can synthesize nitrite from NOHA in a H2O2-supported reaction (17Ghosh D.K. Wu C. Pitters E. Moloney M. Werner E.R. Mayer B. Stuehr D.J.

Marletta M.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15503-15512Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Both full-length iNOS and iNOSox dimers can reversibly dissociate into folded, heme-containing monomers in the presence of urea (12Stuehr D.J. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1997; 37: 339-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). These full-length and iNOSox monomers recombine with one another when H4B and Arg are present to form stable iNOS heterodimers (22Siddhanta U. Wu C. Abu-Soud H.M. Zhang J. Ghosh D.K. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7309-7312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Because such heterodimers contain only one reductase domain, they have been useful in dissecting the electron transfer pathway in iNOS. For example, iNOS heterodimers containing an Arg-binding mutation were used to show that flavin-to-heme electron transfer in an iNOS dimer occurs exclusively between reductase and oxygenase domains of adjacent subunits (23Siddhanta U. Presta A. Fan B. Wolan D. Rousseau D.L. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18950-18958Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Besides providing one reason why dimerization is critical for NO synthesis, this work also showed how heterodimers can help investigate whether single mutations affect iNOS structure-function in a dimeric setting. Determining how H4B functions in NOS catalysis is key to understanding the enzyme reaction mechanism. Recently solved crystal structures for iNOSox and the eNOS oxygenase domain dimers (19Crane B.R.

This is consistent with a variety of biochemical and kinetic evidence that indicates H4B has important structural and electronic effects in iNOS. For example, H4B promotes dimer assembly of iNOS heme-containing monomers (25Abu-Soud H.M. Loftus M. Stuehr D.J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11167-11175Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), protects against proteolysis at Lys-117 in the amino-terminal hook (17Ghosh D.K. Wu C. Pitters E. Moloney M.

Many of these effects have also been observed in nNOS or eNOS. In particular, H4B helps stabilize the nNOS dimer (31Klatt P. Schmidt K. Lehner D. Glatter O. Bachinger H.P. Mayer B. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3687-3695Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar), increases the reactivity of its ferrous-O2 complex (32Abu-Soud H.M. Gachhui R. Rauschel F.M. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol.

Gorren A.C.F. Voelker C. Mayer B. Lange R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13502-13508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). However, there also appear to be differences among the NOS particularly regarding a role for H4B in promoting dimer formation (24Raman C.S. Li H. Martasek P. Kral V. Masters B.S.S. Poulos T.M. Cell. 1998; 95: 939-950Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar, 34Rodriguez-Crespo I. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 336: 151-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Recent work has examined how various structural components of H4B and its ring redox state help promote the H4B-induced effects noted above and support NO synthesis. Studies utilizing tetrahydro- and dihydropterin analogs of H4B show that whereas both the dihydroxypropyl side chain and the pterin ring help determine binding affinity toward NOS, the side chain is more important than the ring in this regard (27Mayer B. Wu C. Gorren A.C. Pfeiffer S. Schmidt K. Clark P. Stuehr D.J. Werner E.R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 8422-8427Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar,35Presta A. Siddhanta U. Wu C. Sennequire N. Huang L. Abu-Soud H.M. Erzurum S. Stuehr D.J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 298-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Considering the pterin ring oxidation state, work with iNOS shows that dihydrobiopterin can mimic H4B in promoting all of the structural or electronic effects listed above except for increasing the reactivity of the ferrous-O2 complex and supporting NO synthesis. This suggests an essential role for H4B is to modulate reactivity of heme iron-oxygen complexes during NO synthesis (32Abu-Soud H.M. Gachhui R. Rauschel F.M. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17349-17353Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). In any case, protein interactions with H4B are likely to modulate many of its electronic and structural functions noted above. From the iNOSox crystal structure it is clear that residues from both the amino and carboxyl termini interact with H4B (19Crane B.R. Arvai A.S. Ghosh D.K. Wu C. Getzoff E.D. Stuehr D.J. Tainer J.A. Science. 1998; 279: 2121-2126Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar). Amino-terminal residues interact primarily with the dihydroxypropyl side chain of H4B, whereas residues in the carboxyl terminus primarily interact with the pterin ring. Four highly conserved residues that interact with the pterin ring are located in the substrate-binding helix (Arg-375) and in a helical lariat structure (Trp-455, Trp-457, and Phe-470) (Fig.1, A and B). Each H4B interacts with two residues provided by the same subunit and two provided by the adjacent subunit of the dimer, and contact with the H4B ring occurs through π-stacking and/or hydrogen-bonding interactions (Fig. 1, A and C). Together, these four residues hold the pterin ring perpendicular to the heme plane and close enough to directly hydrogen-bond to a heme propionate through pterin N-3 (19Crane B.R. Arvai A.S. Ghosh D.K. Wu C. Getzoff E.D. Stuehr D.J. Tainer J.A. Science. 1998; 279: 2121-2126Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1 C). To understand the importance of these four residues (Arg-375, Trp-455, Trp-457, and Phe-470), we employed point mutagenesis to ablate or modify their interactions with the H4B ring, and we characterized each mutant regarding dimer formation, H4B and Arg binding, and enzyme catalysis. We tested the effect of each mutant when it was present in both subunits of an iNOSox homodimer and also when it was present in only one subunit of a iNOS heterodimer comprised of an oxygenase and full-length subunit. Our results show these four residues modulate H4B function in several ways and are important determinants for controlling iNOS structure-function. (6 R)-H4B was purchased from Dr. B. Schirck's laboratory (Jona, Switzerland). ∂-Aminolevulinic acid, Arg, bovine serum albumin (BSA), l-citrulline, 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazinepropanesulfonic acid (EPPS), imidazole, sodium dithionite, sodium nitrite, superoxide dismutase, catalase, hydrogen peroxide were purchased from Sigma.

Glycerol and Terrific Broth were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. His-Bind (nitrilotriacetate) resin was purchased from Novagen (Madison, WI). Site-specific oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis was performed using the Altered Sites II in vitro mutagenesis system of Promega Biochemicals. Primers were synthesized by Life Technologies, Inc. Bacterial expression and purification of the G450A full-length iNOS mutant (18Xie Q.W. Leung M. Fuortes M. Sassa S. Nathan C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4891-4896Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) was done as reported previously for wild-type full-length iNOS (36Wu C. Zhang J. Abu-Soud H.M. Ghosh D.K. Stuehr D.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 222: 439-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Wild-type and mutant iNOSox proteins (amino acids 1–498) with a His6 tag attached to their carboxyl terminus were overexpressed in Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3) using a modified pCWori vector (16Gachhui R. Ghosh D.K. Wu C. Parkinson J. Crane B.R. Stuehr D.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 5097-5103Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The cultures were grown with shaking at 250 rpm at 25 °C. Expression of protein was induced by adding 1 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside to the culture when it reached an optical density of 1 at 600 nm, and ∂-aminolevulinic acid was also added at this point to give a final concentration of 450 μm. Cells were harvested 48 h after induction by centrifugation at 3600 rpm for 15 min. The cells from 4 liters of culture were suspended in a minimum volume of lysis buffer containing 40 mm EPPS, pH 7.6, 0.5 mg/ml lysozyme, 10% glycerol, 0.5 μg/ml each of leupeptin, pepstatin, and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm Arg, and 0.25 m NaCl. Cells were broken by sonication (three 10-s pulses) followed by three cycles of freezing and thawing in liquid N2 and at 37 °C, respectively. The suspension was centrifuged at 13,200 rpm for 25 min to remove cell debris, and the cytochrome P450 concentration of the supernatant was checked. The crude extract was loaded onto a Ni-nitrilotriacetate-Sepharose 4B column (2.5/10 cm) previously charged with 50 mm NiSO4 and equilibrated with 40 mm EPPS buffer, pH 7.6, containing 10% glycerol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.25 mNaCl (buffer A). The column was then washed with 10-bed volumes of buffer A and 5-bed volumes of buffer A containing 40 mmimidazole. Bound protein was eluted with buffer A containing 150–200 mm imidazole. Column fractions containing iNOSox were pooled and concentrated using a Centriprep-30 (Millipore). The concentrated proteins were dialyzed at 4 °C against two 500-ml volumes of 40 mm EPPS, pH 7.6, 10% glycerol, and 1 mm DTT and stored in aliquots at −70 °C. Restriction digestions, cloning, bacterial growth, transformation, and isolation of DNA fragments were performed using standard procedures (37Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning; A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Plainview, NY1989Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis was done using the Altered Sites II in vitro Mutagenesis kit from Promega. Mutant cDNAs were cloned into the Nde I and Sal I sites of the pCWori vector and transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3) for protein expression. Spectral data were recorded on a Hitachi U3110 spectrophotometer in the presence or absence of H4B and Arg. Scans of dithionite-reduced CO-bound proteins were taken in 40 mm EPPS, pH 7.6, containing 10% glycerol, 1 mmDTT, 3 mm Arg, and various concentrations of H4B. The ferrous-CO adduct absorbing at 444 nm was used to quantitate the hemeprotein content using an extinction coefficient of 74 mm−1 cm−1(A444-A500) (38Stuehr D.J. Ikeda-Saito M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20547-20550Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Spectral analysis of H4B binding was done at room temperature using protein samples that had been incubated overnight at 4 °C with various concentrations of H4B (0.1–1 mm). Proteins were diluted in 40 mm EPPS, pH 7.6, containing 5% glycerol and 3 mm DTT or 3 mm β-mercaptoethanol (BME) plus different concentrations of H4B. Arg binding affinity was studied by perturbation difference spectroscopy according to methods described previously (39McMillan K. Masters B.S.S. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9875-9880Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 40Ghosh D.K. Abu-Soud H.M. Stuehr D.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1444-1449Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Protein samples were incubated with H4B overnight at 4 °C and then diluted to ∼3 μm in buffer containing 10% glycerol, 1 mm DTT, 300 μm H4B, and 0.4 mmimidazole to promote formation of a low spin heme-imidazole complex prior to titration. Spectra were recorded after equilibrium was reached ∼10 min after each addition of Arg. The final sample volume change was less than 5%. Difference spectra were generated by subtracting the spectrum obtained without Arg from each subsequent spectrum using Spectra Calc software (Galactic Industries Corp.). Apparent binding constants for Arg were determined from double-reciprocal plots of the difference in the respective peak to trough absorbances versus the Arg concentration. For mutants whose Arg binding affinity was determined in the presence of imidazole, we also determined their imidazole binding affinities by serially adding imidazole to a cuvette containing a mutant iNOSox, 0.5 mmH4B, but no Arg, and a spectrum was recorded after each addition. The data were analyzed by double-reciprocal plotting as described above to determine imidazole Ks values. Imidazole Ks values were then used in Equation 1 to correct for the effect of imidazole on the apparent Arg Ksvalues (50Roman L.J. Sheta E.A. Martasek P. Gross S.S. Liu Q. Masters B.S.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8428-8432Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar), Ks Arg=apparentKsArg[1+(imidazole concentration/Kdfor imidazole)]Equation 1 Arg binding for some mutants was studied without imidazole. In this case proteins were incubated overnight at 4 °C with 1 mm H4B and then diluted in the same buffer as above containing 1 mm H4B, and the spectra were recorded after each addition of Arg and analyzed by double-reciprocal analysis. Dimer and monomer content of iNOSox proteins was estimated by chromatography on an Amersham Pharmacia Biotech Superdex-200 HR size-exclusion column equilibrated with 40 mm EPPS, pH 7.4, containing 10% glycerol, 0.25m NaCl, and 0.5 mm DTT. The molecular weight of the protein peaks were estimated relative to protein molecular weight standards as described previously (17Ghosh D.K. Wu C. Pitters E. Moloney M. Werner E.R. Mayer B.

Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1444-1449Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Catalysis of nitrite production from NOHA and H2O2 by iNOSox or mutants was assayed in 96-well microplates at 37 °C as described previously (16Gachhui R. Ghosh D.K. Wu C. Parkinson J. Crane B.R. Stuehr D.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 5097-5103Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar,41Pufahl R.A. Wishnok J.S. Marletta M.A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 1930-1941Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) with modifications. Assays (0.1 ml final volume) contained 100 mm EPPS, pH 7.5, 150 nm iNOSox hemeprotein, 1 mm NOHA, 0.5 mm DTT, 30 mmH2O2, 10 units/ml superoxide dismutase, 50 μg/ml BSA, and variable concentrations of H4B (0.3–100 μm). Reactions were started by adding H2O2 and stopped by adding catalase (1300 units). Griess reagent (0.1 ml) was then added, and the assay plate was read at 550 nm in a Thermomax plate reader. Nitrite production was quantitated based on NaNO2 standards. For monomer formation, wild-type iNOSox or mutant iNOSox proteins were incubated 1.5 h at a concentration of 50–70 μm in 40 mm EPPS pH 7.6, containing 5m urea, 3 mm DTT, and 10% glycerol at 37 °C. They were then placed on ice and incubated for an additional 30 min. The samples were then diluted 10-fold with 40 mmEPPS, 10% glycerol, and 3 mm DTT and incubated at various concentrations (0–2.5 μm) with 200 nmfull-length G450A monomer for complementation experiments. Antagonist experiments were done the same way except they also included 300 nm wild-type iNOSox monomer in each well. To promote dimerization 1 mm BH4 and 20 mm Arg were added to the protein mixtures to give a final volume of 50 μl, and the samples were incubated for 1 h at 30 °C. For antagonist experiments, protein mixtures were preincubated for 30 min prior to adding H4B and Arg. After this dimerization incubation, heterodimer NO synthesis was assayed by diluting each sample to 100 μl with assay buffer such that each well contained a final concentration of 40 mm EPPS, 3 mm DTT, 4 μm FAD, 4 μm FMN, 800 μm H4B, 15 mm Arg, 1 mg/ml BSA, 18 units/ml catalase, and 10 units/ml superoxide dismutase. NADPH (1 mm) was added to start the NO synthesis reaction. The assays ran for 1 h at 37 °C, and the reactions stopped by enzymatic oxidation of NADPH. Griess reagent (0.1 ml) was added to each well, and the absorbance was measured at 550–650 nm in a microplate reader. Absorbance due to nitrite produced in the reaction was quantitated based on NaNO2 standards. In some cases heterodimer NO synthesis was assayed using the spectrophotometric oxyhemoglobin assay (23Siddhanta U. Presta A. Fan B. Wolan D. Rousseau D.L. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18950-18958Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 35Presta A. Siddhanta U. Wu C. Sennequire N. Huang L. Abu-Soud H.M. Erzurum S. Stuehr D.J.

After the dimerization incubation, sample aliquots were transferred from the microwells into cuvettes containing 40 mm EPPS, pH 7.6, 10 mmArg, 0.1 mm H4B, 0.3 mm DTT, 1 mg/ml BSA, 10 units/ml superoxide dismutase, 100 units/ml catalase, 4 μm FAD and FMN, 5 μm oxyhemoglobin, and 300 μm NADPH in a total reaction volume of 500 μl. Heterodimer concentrations ranged from 10 to 30 nm in the cuvette, and the reactions were started by adding NADPH and run at 37 °C. The NO-mediated conversion of oxyhemoglobin to methemoglobin over the first 5 min of the reaction was monitored at 401 nm and converted to a rate of NO synthesis using the difference extinction coefficient of ε401 = 38 mm−1cm−1. All nine mutant iNOSox proteins were purified in the absence of Arg and H4B. The amount of recoverable protein varied from 5 to 15 mg/liter culture, and all purified proteins displayed a normal heme content"
https://openalex.org/W2062228248,"The protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) holoenzyme is structurally conserved among eukaryotes. This reflects a conservation of function in vivo because the human catalytic subunit (PP2Ac) functionally replaced the endogenous PP2Ac of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and bound the yeast regulatory PR65/A subunit (Tpd3p) forming a dimer. Yeast was employed as a novel system for mutagenesis and functional analysis of human PP2Ac, revealing that the invariant C-terminal leucine residue, a site of regulatory methylation, is apparently dispensable for protein function. However, truncated forms of human PP2Ac lacking larger portions of the C terminus exerted a dominant interfering effect, as did several mutant forms containing a substitution mutation. Computer modeling of PP2Ac structure revealed that interfering amino acid substitutions clustered to the active site, and consistently, the PP2Ac-L199P mutant protein was catalytically impaired despite binding Tpd3p. Thus, interfering forms of PP2Ac titrate regulatory subunits and/or substrates into non-productive complexes and will serve as useful tools for studying PP2A function in mammalian cells. The transgenic approach employed here, involving a simple screen for interfering mutants, may be applicable generally to the analysis of structure-function relationships within protein phosphatases and other conserved proteins and demonstrates further the utility of yeast for analyzing gene function.

PP2A exists as a holoenzyme in which the catalytic subunit (PP2Ac) binds a regulatory PR65/A subunit to form a core dimer, which associates with a large number of variable B subunits encoded by at least three gene families (7Mayer R.E.

Hemmings B.A. Biochem. J. 1995; 311: 17-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar). The budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae possesses two proteins Pph21p and Pph22p similar to mammalian PP2Ac (15Sneddon A.A. Cohen P.T.W. Stark M.J.R. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 4339-4346Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The homologous PPH21 and PPH22 genes encoding yeast PP2Ac are functionally redundant because either can be deleted without effect. However, doubly deleting PPH21 and PPH22 causes severe growth inhibition and is lethal in the absence of PPH3, encoding a distantly related protein phosphatase that provides overlapping function (16Ronne H. Carlberg M. Hu G-Z. Nehlin J.O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 4876-4884Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Conservation of PP2A extends to the holoenzyme because the S. cerevisiae Tpd3p (17van Zyl W Huang W. Sneddon A.A. Stark M. Camier S. Werner M. Marck C. Sentenac A. Broach J.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4946-4959Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), Cdc55p (18Healy A.M. Zolnierowicz S. Stapleton A.E. Goebl M. DePaoli-Roach A.A. Pringle J.R. Mol. Cell.

Genetics. 1996; 142: 1083-1093Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) are similar to the regulatory PR65/A, PR55/B, and PR61/B′ subunits, respectively, of mammalian PP2A, and Tpd3p and Cdc55p bind Pph21p/Pph22p in vivo (20Di Como C.J. Arndt K.T. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1904-1916Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). This suggests that PP2A regulation is conserved between species, and consistent with this, a novel methyltransferase that targets the PP2Ac C-terminal leucine residue and modulates PP2A activity (21Favre B. Zolnierowicz S. Turowski P. Hemmings B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16311-16317Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) is present in both higher eukaryotes and yeast (22Xie H. Clarke S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1981-1984Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Xie H. Clarke S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 203: 1710-1715Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The role of PP2A has been studied biochemically, through the use of inhibitors and viral tumor antigens that target the enzyme specifically, and genetically, via inactivating subunit mutations. Moreover, the crystal structure of the PR65/A subunit of PP2A was recently solved (24Groves M.R. Hanlon N. Turowski P. Hemmings B.A. Barford D. Cell. 1999; 96: 99-110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). Together these studies have implicated PP2A in processes including cell cycle regulation, cellular morphogenesis, protein synthesis, and viral replication (4Wera S. Hemmings B.A. Biochem. J. 1995; 311: 17-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar). Although the biochemical and functional properties of PP2A differ from those of protein phosphatase type 1 (PP1), the catalytic subunits of these enzymes share ∼46% amino acid sequence identity. The crystal structure of PP1γ1 has been solved (25Egloff M.-P. Cohen P.T.W. Reinemer P. Barford D. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 254: 942-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar, 26Goldberg J.

Nature. 1995; 376: 745-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (751) Google Scholar) and provides a framework for predicting the role of specific PP2Ac residues and interpreting the effect of changes generated by mutagenesis. In this study, we have functionally expressed human PP2Ac in S. cerevisiae and used this as a convenient system to generate novel mutations in human PP2Ac and analyze their effect on PP2A function in vivo. We have identified a number of novel, interfering mutant forms of PP2Ac and rationalized their effects using a model of PP2Ac structure based on that of PP1γ1. Yeast strains are described in Table I. Rich (yeast peptone medium, YPD), minimal (synthetic dextrose, SD), and 5-FOA media were described (27Kaiser C. Michaelis S. Mitchell A. Methods in Yeast Genetics.

Open table in a new tab Two forms of HsPP2Ac tagged with the HA epitope were used. A single HA tag was inserted downstream of the PP2Acα initiation codon, by amplifying the human cDNA (31Khew-Goodall Y. Mayer R.E. Maurer F. Stone S.R. Hemmings B.A. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 89-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) in the PCR using an appropriate forward primer. A Sal I/Kpn I HA-PP2Acα clone, or a frameshifted allele, HA-PP2Acα-FS lacking the second nucleotide of the ninth codon, was introduced between the PGK1 promoter/CYC1 terminator of vector pYPGE2 generating plasmids YEpDE-PGK-Cα and YEpDE-PGK-FS. A similar Nco I/Bam HI fragment was introduced into vector pACTII (P. Legrain, Pasteur Institute) fusing the HA-PP2Acα ORF to the Gal4 activation domain. A second sequence encoding an extended HA-PP2Acα ORF was used for HsPP2Ac immunoprecipitation experiments because it encodes native HsPP2Ac with an epitope accessible to the 12CA5 antibody (32Voorhoeve P.M. Hijmans E.M. Bernards R. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 515-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar).PP2Acα containing this tag was introduced into vectors pYPGE2 (YEpDE-PGK-CHA) and pYES2 (YEpDE2-CαHA), and similarly tagged PP2Ac-2512 and PP2Ac-118 alleles were introduced into pYES2 (YEpDE-GAL-2512HA and YEpDE-GAL-118HA). Mutations were generated in HA-PP2Acα by PCR amplification using QuickChange (Stratagene). Truncations of the HA-PP2Acα ORF were generated in vitro by PCR using a reverse primer that introduced a stop at codon 309 (PP2Ac-Δ309), 301 (PP2Ac-Δ300), or 67 (PP2Ac-Δ67) (codon numbering for untagged PP2Acα). PP2Acα mutant alleles were inserted between the Hin dIII/Bam HI sites of pYES2 and downstream of Sal I in pYPGE2. Plasmid DNA was prepared from strain DEY1-Cα using a Kristal extraction kit (Cambridge Molecular Technologies); six plasmids, recovered from independent ampr Escherichia coli colonies, were tested for a restriction pattern (Sal I/Kpn I or Xba I) identical to that of YEpDE-PGK-Cα. The nucleotide sequence of one plasmid was analyzed, and it encoded YEpDE-PGK-Cα. Cell extracts were prepared as described (33Cohen P. Schelling D.L. Stark M.J.R. FEBS Lett. 1989; 250: 601-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Protein transfer and Western blotting were as described (9Hendrix P. Turowski P. Mayer-Jaekel R.E. Goris J. Hofsteenge J. Merlevede W. Hemmings B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7330-7337Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Antibodies were diluted in TNPT (1.0% Nonidet P-40, 0.3% Triton X-100 in Tris-buffered saline (TBS, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5)) containing 7.5% powdered milk. Membranes were washed with TNPT. Detection was by goat anti-mouse IgG-HRP and ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The PPH22 gene was PCR-amplified using a forward primer appropriate to generate pph22Δ52 encoding an initiation codon followed by codons 53–377 of PPH22 and a stop codon TAA. A pph22Δ52 1.0-kb Sal I/Kpn I fragment was fused to the PGK1 promoter in pYPGE2. A 3.4-kb genomic fragment encompassing the yeast TPD3 gene (17van Zyl W Huang W. Sneddon A.A. Stark M. Camier S. Werner M. Marck C. Sentenac A. Broach J.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4946-4959Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) was inserted into YEp351 (YEpDE11) and was template for a PCR generating a TPD3 ORF, flanked by its native promoter/terminator, with a double c-myc tag downstream of the initiator codon (myc-TPD3). A 3169-base pair myc-TPD3 Sac I/Sal I fragment was inserted into vectors pRS314, YEp351, and YEp352 (YCpDE3-2m, YEpDE3-2m, and YEpDE4-2m, respectively). The myc-TPD3 allele is functional because YCpDE3-2m rescued the ts growth defect of haploid tpd3Δ1::URA3 mutant cells (not shown). To precipitate HA-tagged proteins, PAS CL-4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated in 1× TBS was incubated at 4 °C with 12CA5 overnight and then washed extensively (six times with 10 volumes of TBS). Antibody-saturated beads (PAS-12CA5, 35 μl) were added to ∼100 μl of yeast extract, incubated at 4 °C for 2 h, and washed extensively. Phosphatase assays (50 μl) were performed on immune complexes according to Promega (kit V2460) measuring phosphate release over 10 min from a chemically synthesized phosphopeptide (RRA(pT)VA, where pT indicates phosphothreonine) with MnCl2 present at 1 mm. Assays were performed in duplicate on immune complexes prepared independently, and activity is expressed as units (1 unit = 1 μmol of phosphate hydrolyzed per min). For co-immunoprecipitations, cell extracts were prepared in Buffer A (100 mm Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, 1.0 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40) with protease inhibitors. PAS-12CA5 (35 μl) was added to 1.0 mg of extract, incubated at 4 °C for 2–5 h, washed extensively with Buffer A, and boiled in 50 μl of Laemmli Buffer. A 970-base pair Hin dIII/Bam HI HA-PP2Acα fragment was inserted into the GAL1/CYC1 promoter/terminator cassette of pYES2, and this plasmid, YEpDE-CαHA, was cleaved with Afl II/Bst EII generating a gap within the PP2Acα ORF. In parallel, the intact insert in YEpDECαHA was amplified under mutagenic conditions for the PCR (0.2 ng/μl template DNA, 1× reaction buffer (Perkin-Elmer), 0.5 pmol/μl primer T7, 0.5 pmol/μl primer 20622 (5′-AGAGGATCCTTACAGGAAGTAGTCTGGGGTACGACGAGTAAC), 0.5 mm each dCTP and dTTP, 0.1 mm each dATP and dGTP, 3 mm MgCl2, 0.1 or 0.2 mmMnCl2, 5 units of Taq polymerase, 33 cycles of 94 °C for 1.5 min, 55 °C for 2.0 min, 72 °C for 3.0 min).PP2Acα mutant alleles were recovered by co-transforming (34Muhlrad D. Hunter R. Parker R. Yeast. 1992; 8: 79-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar) cells (strain DEY1-Cα) with gapped plasmid DNA (0.5 μg) and mutagenic PCR product (200 ng). Ura+ transformants were selected on SD lacking uracil and then replica-plated to synthetic dextrose (SD) and synthetic galactose (SG) medium to identify plasmids containing dominant-negative alleles expressed from the GAL1 promoter. Plasmids recovered from cells capable of growth on glucose but not galactose were checked for gap repair by restriction analysis and reintroduced into DEY1-Cα to confirm growth inhibition on galactose. To test competition between PP2Acα wild type and mutant alleles, the 2.3-kb Sna BI/Eco RI fragment from YEpDE-CαHA, containing HA-PP2ACα fused to the GAL1 promoter, was inserted between the Sma I/Eco RI sites of vector pASZ11[CEN.ARS ADE2] and named YCpDE11-GAL-Cα. The HA-PP2Acα-FS allele was similarly inserted into pASZ11 (YCpDE11-GAL-FS) as a negative control for PP2Acα function. To express PP2Ac-2512 from the GAL1 promoter in pASZ11 the 0.75-kb Nco I/Sac I fragment of YCpDE11-GAL-Cα was replaced by the equivalent DNA from YEpDE-GAL-2512 (PP2Ac-2512 in pYES2) and tested (plasmid YCpDE11-GAL-2512) for inducible growth inhibition in DEY1-Cα as above. PP2Acα wild type and mutant alleles were expressed from the GAL1 promoter of pYES2 in yeast strain INVSC1. Cells were grown to a density of 5.0 × 106 per ml at 30 °C in selective (synthetic raffinose, SR) medium containing raffinose (2.0%), glycerol (3.0%), and casamino acids (0.2%) followed by the addition of an equal volume of SG medium containing galactose at 4.0%. A homology-based model was obtained using the coordinates of PP1γ1 (a gift from Dr. David Barford, University of Oxford). Residues 1–309 of human PP2Acα and 8–316 of human PP1γ1 were aligned using “GAP” (GCG Wisconsin Package, Madison, WI). The optimal alignment (46% identity with four 1-amino acid gaps) was used by “MODELER” (Ref.35Sali A. Blundell T.T. Mol. Biol. 1993; 2324: 779-815Crossref Scopus (10563) Google Scholar; BIOSYM/Molecular Simulations, San Diego, CA) to build and refine five PP2Ac models. PP1γ1 appears unstructured between residues 299 and 316 (25Egloff M.-P. Cohen P.T.W. Reinemer P. Barford D. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 254: 942-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar), and no models were obtained for PP2Ac in this region (the C terminus of the models is Pro-291). The best model, selected on the basis of the lowest violations of the probability density functions, was evaluated using “Profiles-3D” (Ref. 36Luthy R. Bowie J.U. Eisenberg D. Nature. 1992; 356: 83-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (2586) Google Scholar; BIOSYM/Molecular Simulations, San Diego, CA). Its overall self-compatibility score, 139.2, was close to that expected for a polypeptide chain of this length, 140.6, indicating reliability of the model. The primary structure of PP2Ac is highly conserved from yeast to humans (2Barton G.J. Cohen P.T.W. Barford D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 220: 225-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar); excluding an N-terminal extension (∼50 residues) to the S. cerevisiae protein, the yeast and human PP2Ac polypeptides display 71% amino acid sequence identity. To investigate whether the conservation of PP2Ac structure reflects a conservation of function, we tested the ability of human PP2Ac (HsPP2Ac) to functionally replace the corresponding protein from S. cerevisiae (ScPP2Ac). We used haploid yeast cells (strain DEY1) triply deleted for the chromosomal PPH21, PPH22, and PPH3 genes and supported by a plasmid-borne PPH22 gene encoding ScPP2Ac (30Evans D.R.H. Stark M.J.R. Genetics. 1997; 145: 227-241Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A second plasmid, carrying the human PP2Acα clone fused to the yeast PGK promoter and the hemagglutinin epitope, was introduced, and heterologous expression of HA-tagged HsPP2Ac was analyzed by immunoblot analysis (see Fig.1A). Two forms of HsPP2Ac were detected, suggesting that the human protein undergoes post-translational modification in yeast, and both forms migrated at approximately 36 kDa, faster than the endogenous ScPP2Ac at 43 kDa (not shown). HsPP2Ac was analyzed for function in yeast using a plasmid shuffling assay, testing for the ability of cells to grow in the absence of ScPP2Ac (Fig. 1B); this assay tests for the ability of yeast cells to grow on medium containing 5-FOA (37Boeke D.P. Trueheart J. Natsoulis G. Fink G.R. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 164-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (1075) Google Scholar) which negatively selects against the essential URA3 PPH22 plasmid encoding ScPP2Ac in strain DEY1. Cells containing PP2Acα lost PPH22 at high frequency and grew on 5-FOA medium, whereas cells containing a non-functional PP2Acα clone with a 5′-frameshift (PP2Acα-FS) or the empty vector failed to grow without PPH22. An incoming TRP1 PPH22 plasmid also substituted for the resident URA3 PPH22 plasmid as expected. This indicates that HsPP2Ac is functional in yeast and that it supports cell growth in the absence of ScPP2Ac. Consistent with this, cells cured of PPH22 by plasmid shuffling contained plasmid DNA carrying the PP2Acα clone (see “Experimental Procedures”) and expressed the 36-kDa HsPP2Ac (Fig. 1 A). Moreover, in an alternative test of function (Fig. 1 C), PP2Acα rescued the ts growth defect of pph22-172 mutant yeast cells that undergo loss of endogenous ScPP2Ac function at 37 °C because of a conditional-lethal point mutation in PPH22 (30Evans D.R.H. Stark M.J.R. Genetics. 1997; 145: 227-241Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, a truncated allele of PPH22 lacking the first 52 codons (pph22Δ52) functionally replaced full-length PPH22 in strain DEY1 (Fig. 1 D) even at 37 °C (not shown) indicating that the N-terminal extension to ScPP2Ac is dispensable for cell viability, consistent with the ability of HsPP2Ac to replace the endogenous yeast enzyme. Because PP2Ac heterodimerizes with a regulatory PR65/A subunit (1Cohen P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 453-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (2156) Google Scholar), we tested whether HsPP2Ac binds the endogenous yeast PR65/A subunit Tpd3p in vivo. We tagged Tpd3p with the Myc epitope (Myc-Tpd3p) and asked whether it co-precipitates with HA-tagged HsPP2Ac from a yeast extract (Fig. 2 A). When proteins were precipitated using the 12CA5 antibody, Myc-Tpd3p but not untagged Tpd3p was detected in an immune complex prepared from cells expressing HA-HsPP2Ac, whereas Myc-Tpd3 was absent from a similar complex prepared from cells expressing ScPP2Ac lacking the HA epitope. This indicates HsPP2Ac binds the yeast PR65/A subunit and that, consistently, HsPP2Ac interacted with Tpd3p in the yeast two-hybrid system (Fig.2 B). This supports the conclusion that HsPP2Ac is functional in yeast. Moreover, HsPP2Ac prepared from yeast was catalytically active (see below). We used yeast cells functionally expressing HsPP2Ac to identify mutant forms of the human enzyme that interfere with wild type PP2Ac function. A library of human PP2Acα mutant alleles, fused to the yeast GAL1 promoter, was generated by random mutagenesis and screened for those that inducibly inhibited cell growth on galactose medium. Eleven mutant alleles were identified (Fig. 3) that dominantly inhibited the growth of cells expressing wild type PP2Acα constitutively from the PGK1 promoter (strain DEY1-Cα). The PP2Ac-2512 allele inhibited growth even when transferred to an alternative GAL plasmid (see “Experimental Procedures”) demonstrating that its dominant-negative effect was caused by mutation of PP2Acα and not vector DNA (not shown). Five mutant alleles contained nonsense mutations within the PP2Acα ORF and encoded C-terminally truncated forms of HsPP2Ac. Of these, the PP2Ac-182 allele encoded the largest truncation deleting the C-terminal 145 amino acids. A further dominant-negative allele, PP2Ac-144-2, encoded a −1 frameshift mutation within codon 307 of PP2Acα, extending the ORF by 57 codons. Together this indicates that an intact C terminus is required for wild type HsPP2Ac function, and its modification may cause an interfering effect. However, the PP2Ac-Δ67 allele, encoding HsPP2Ac lacking residues 68–309 (Fig. 3), did not cause a dominant-negative effect (see “Discussion”). Another five PP2Acα mutant alleles encoded missense mutations, and in each case (excepting PP2Ac-2446) a single amino acid substitution was sufficient for dominant inhibition of cell growth (Fig. 3). Immunoblot analysis of HA-tagged HsPP2Ac proteins revealed that wild type PP2Acα and dominant-negative missense alleles were expressed from the GAL1 promoter to a similar level, whereas nonsense alleles were expressed to a lower level (data not shown). Because GAL-expressed wild type PP2Acα did not inhibit cell growth, the interfering effect of PP2Acα dominant-negative alleles must be caused by an intrinsic property of their products and not by toxic, high levels of expression. The screen for PP2Acα dominant-negative alleles was performed in yeast cells containing human, and lacking yeast, PP2Ac. To test for growth inhibition in the presence of ScPP2Ac, we introduced PP2Acα mutant alleles into PPH22 pph21Δ pph3Δ cells, in which Pph22p provides ScPP2Ac function. When expressed from the GAL1 promoter, each PP2Acα dominant-negative allele tested inhibited cell growth (Table II) suggesting that its product interfered with ScPP2Ac function. Moreover, when PP2Acα dominant-negative alleles were expressed in pph22-12 pph21Δ pph3Δ cells, containing a mutant Pph22p functionally impaired by a single amino acid substitution"

We previously reported the cloning of the full-length cDNA for a porcine β-defensin (pBD-1), which was found to be expressed throughout the airway and oral mucosa. Here, we provide the structural organization of the pBD-1 gene, showing that the entire gene spans ∼1.9 kilobases with two short exons separated by a 1.5-kilobase intron. Fluorescence in situ hybridization mapped the pBD-1 gene to porcine chromosome 15q14-q15.1 within a region of conserved synteny to the chromosomal locations of human and mouse α- and β-defensins. We also provide several independent lines of evidence showing that the pBD-1 gene is expressed constitutively during inflammation and infection, despite its resemblance to many inducible epithelial β-defensins in amino acid sequence, genomic structure, and sites of expression. First, stimulation of primary porcine tongue epithelial cells with lipopolysaccharide, tumor necrosis factor-α, and interleukin (IL)-1β failed to up-regulate the expression of pBD-1 mRNA. Second, pBD-1 gene expression was not enhanced in either digestive or respiratory mucosa of pigs following a 2-day infection with Salmonella typhimurium or Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae. Last, direct transfection of the pBD-1 gene promoter into NIH/3T3 cells showed no difference in reporter gene activity in response to stimulation by lipopolysaccharide and IL-1β. The constitutive expression of pBD-1 in airway and oral mucosa, which is consistent with a lack of consensus binding sites for nuclear factor-κB or NF-IL-6 in its promoter region, suggests that it may play a surveillance role in maintaining the steady state of microflora on mucosal surfaces.

Based on the positions of six cysteine residues and linkages of the disulfide bonds, defensins are divided further into two groups: α- and β-defensins. In contrast to most α-defensins, which are of myeloid origin and expressed constitutively in granulocytic leukocytes, many β-defensins are synthesized inducibly by epithelial cells during inflammation and infection (2Martin E.

Nature. 1997; 387: 861Crossref PubMed Scopus (1182) Google Scholar) belong to this group. They are expressed abundantly in oral and airway epithelia. Another striking difference between these two groups is that the β-defensins of the first group have a constitutive expression pattern, whereas genes in the second group are expressed inducibly during inflammation and infection. Genes for TAP-like inducible β-defensins contain several consensus recognition sites for nuclear factor (NF)-κB and NF-IL-6 in their promoter regions, which may explain their inducibility upon inflammation and infection (12Liu L.

However, the reliability of this classification scheme remains to be tested because significant interspecies differences exist in gene families of many peptide antibiotics (1Boman H. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1995; 13: 61-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (1496) Google Scholar).Recently, we cloned the full-length cDNA for a porcine β-defensin (pBD-1), which is expressed abundantly in tongue epithelia and to a lesser extent throughout the respiratory and digestive tracts (26Zhang G. Wu H. Shi J. Ganz T. Ross C.R. Blecha F. FEBS Lett. 1998; 424: 37-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). It resembles many inducible epithelial β-defensins, including bovine TAP, lingual antimicrobial peptide, and enteric β-defensin and human BD-2 in both amino acid sequence and sites of expression (26Zhang G. Wu H. Shi J. Ganz T. Ross C.R. Blecha F. FEBS Lett. 1998; 424: 37-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Recombinant pBD-1 has potent antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium, and Listeria monocytogenes in a salt-dependent fashion and also is synergistic with several porcine neutrophil-derived peptide antibiotics in killing these bacteria (42Shi J. Zhang G. Wu H. Ross C. Blecha F. Ganz T. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 3121-3127Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Here, we report the cloning, mapping, and characterization of the pBD-1 gene. The gene mapped to Sus scrofa chromosome 15q14-q15.1, providing the first direct evidence that Homo sapiens chromosome 8p23, the location of human α- and β-defensin genes (12Liu L. Wang L. Jia H.P.

Mamm. Genome. 1996; 7: 285-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). In contrast to the genes for other inducible epithelial β-defensins, the pBD-1 gene does not contain consensus binding sites in the promoter region for either NF-κB or NF-IL-6, suggesting that it may not be modulated by proinflammatory mediators. Indeed, we provide several lines of evidence showing that the pBD-1 gene is expressed constitutively during inflammation and infection. To our knowledge, this is the first example that contradicts the current classification of epithelial β-defensins by showing that TAP-like β-defensins do not always exhibit an inducible expression pattern. These findings also support the hypothesis that epithelial pBD-1 may play a role in maintaining the balance of natural microflora on mucosal surfaces under basal conditions.DISCUSSIONSkin and epithelial tissues are exposed continuously to a variety of microorganisms and thus provide the first line of defense between the host and the environment (53Weinberg A.

Disruption of this barrier commonly leads to microbial invasion and subsequent inflammation and infection. Indeed, skin and mucosa not only serve as physical barriers, but also produce a vast array of endogenous peptide antibiotics, including two major types, namely cathelicidins (55Zanetti M. Gennaro R.

Sci. 1997; 832: 147-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) and β-defensins (2Martin E. Ganz T. Lehrer R.I. J.

In contrast, β-defensins are the best characterized epithelium-derived peptide antibiotics and many have been implicated in mucosal immunity (11Diamond G. Bevins C.L. Clin. Immunol. Immunopathol. 1998; 88: 221-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). To date, most β-defensins in humans, mice, cattle, sheep, and pigs have been shown to be expressed by either skin keratinocytes or epithelial cells throughout the respiratory, digestive, and urogenital tracts.These epithelial β-defensins have been classified into two groups based on the differences in homology of amino acid sequences, gene structure, and the sites of expression (11Diamond G. Bevins C.L. Clin. Immunol. Immunopathol. 1998; 88: 221-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 26Zhang G. Wu H. Shi J. Ganz T. Ross C.R. Blecha F. FEBS Lett. 1998; 424: 37-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). As shown with epithelial β-defensins of humans, mice, and cattle, TAP-like genes are up-regulated in response to infectious or inflammatory agents (12Liu L. Wang L. Jia H.P. Zhao C. Heng H.H.Q.

Christophers E. Schroder J.M. Nature. 1997; 387: 861Crossref PubMed Scopus (1182) Google Scholar), whereas human BD-1-like genes have a constitutive expression pattern regardless of inflammation or infection (17Huttner K.M. Kozark C.A. Bevins C.L. FEBS Lett. 1997; 413: 45-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 28Zhao C. Wang I. Lehrer R.I.

Based on its amino acid sequence, pBD-1 could be placed into the group of TAP-like genes with an expected inducible expression pattern. However, several independent lines of evidence indicated that the pBD-1 gene was not up-regulated in response to inflammatory mediators or during infectious states. This finding may reflect interspecies variation, which is observed commonly in gene families of many peptide antibiotics. The pBD-1 gene appears to be the only example, examined to date, that is contrary to the current classification in that it exhibits a constitutive expression pattern, although resembling TAP-like genes. Thus, classification and generalization of epithelial β-defensins must be made with caution, and more precise grouping awaits the identification and characterization of more family members.In our studies, stimulation of porcine tongue epithelial cells with LPS, TNF-α, and IL-1β did not enhance the expression of the pBD-1 mRNA. These agents are all potent inflammatory mediators and are encountered commonly by epithelial cells of the oral or airway mucosa. Following experimental infections with either S. typhimurium or A. pleuropneumoniae, pigs failed to increase pBD-1 gene expression to counteract the bacterial invasions into the intestinal or tracheal mucosa. These findings are in agreement with our previous data showing no increase in pBD-1 protein after porcine tongue was subjected to localized microinjury (42Shi J. Zhang G. Wu H. Ross C. Blecha F. Ganz T. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 3121-3127Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Scanning the promoter region of the pBD-1 gene revealed a lack of consensus binding sites for NF-κB and NF-IL-6, which are major transcription factors involved in the acute-phase response and inflammation (58Kopp E.B. Ghost S. Adv. Immunol. 1995; 58: 1-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar, 59Baeuerle P.A. Baltimore D.

Consistent with this observation, direct transfection of a 1.4-kb pBD-1 gene promoter showed no difference in the reporter gene activity in response to challenge with up to 10 μg/ml LPS.Our physical localization of the pBD-1 gene to S. scrofa chromosome 15q14-q15.1 provides support for previous ZOO-FISH data indicating that a narrow region of H. sapiens chromosome 8 corresponds to S. scrofa chromosome q15 (43Goureau A.

Moreover, it adds valuable information to the comparative map by providing the first direct evidence that H. sapiens chromosome 8p23, the location of human α- and β-defensin genes (12Liu L. Wang L.

Genomics. 1997; 43: 316-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar), is homologous to this region of S. scrofa chromosome 15. Thus, it provides an entry point for testing whether other loci on H. sapiens chromosome 8p23 may also map to this region of S. scrofa chromosome 15.In summary, we have cloned and characterized an additional gene for epithelial β-defensins, namely the pBD-1 gene, and have physically mapped it to S. scrofa chromosome 15q14-q15.1. Although it resembles many inducible epithelial β-defensins in genomic structure, amino acid sequence, and sites of expression, the pBD-1 gene is expressed constitutively by epithelia of porcine tongue, intestine, and trachea during inflammation and infection. This pattern of expression and disposition of the pBD-1 peptide in airway and oral mucosa suggests that it may play a role in maintaining the steady state of natural microflora on mucosal surfaces. Mammalian defensins constitute a large family of endogenous peptide antibiotics with broad spectrum activity against various bacteria, mycobacteria, fungi, and viruses (1Boman H. Annu. Rev.

Upon microbial invasion, mature active defensins are released quickly by proteolytic processing from precursor peptides either in cytoplasmic granules of most mammalian neutrophils and macrophages or in epithelial cells of the respiratory, gastroenteric, and urogenital tracts (2Martin E. Ganz T. Lehrer R.I. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1995; 58: 128-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar, 3Lehrer R.I. Ganz T. Ann. N. Y. Acad.

Killing of bacteria by defensins appears to involve direct interactions with target cell membranes, followed by insertion and permeabilization of membranes by forming multimeric pores (1Boman H.

In the present study, we have further investigated the ability of the N-terminal signal sequence (residues 1–44) of P4501A1 to target heterologous proteins, dihydrofolate reductase, and the mature portion of the rat P450c27 to the two subcellular compartments. In vitro transport and in vivo expression experiments show that N-terminally fused 1–44 signal sequence of P4501A1 targets heterologous proteins to both the ER and mitochondria, whereas the 33–44 sequence strictly functions as a mitochondrial targeting signal. Site-specific mutations show that positively charged residues at the 34th and 39th positions are critical for mitochondrial targeting. Cholesterol 27-hydroxylase activity of the ER-associated 1–44/1A1-CYP27 fusion protein can be reconstituted with cytochrome P450 reductase, but the mitochondrial associated fusion protein is functional with adrenodoxin + adrenodoxin reductase. Consistent with these differences, the fusion protein in the two organelle compartments exhibited distinctly different membrane topology.

In metazoan organisms, P450s involved in the physiological pathways, and also the inducible P450s, implicated in the xenobiotic metabolism are predominantly localized in the ER (routinely referred to as microsomal P450), as well as mitochondria of liver and a number of extrahepatic tissues (1Porter T.D.

Models on the topological organization of microsomal P450s suggest that the heme protein is anchored on the ER membrane through a single transmembrane domain, with most part of the protein facing the cytosolic side (8Sakaguchi M. Mihara K. Sato R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 3361-3364Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 9Szczesna-Skorupa E. Brown N. Mead D. Kemper B. J.

Some studies also suggest additional extrinsic interaction of cytoplasmic exposed P450 domains with the lipid bilayer (12Black S.D. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The N-terminal 35–40 residues of different microsomal P450s are thought to provide the transmembrane anchor, in addition to stop transfer signal for membrane insertion (9Szczesna-Skorupa E. Brown N.

Membrane topology of the mitochondrial P450s remains relatively less clear. Based on the apparent lack of an N-terminal transmembrane helical domain in the constitutively expressed P450Scc and P450c27 (15Degli Esositi M. Crimi M. Venturoli G. Euro. J.

Pharmacol. 1999; 156: 231-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), the mitochondrial P450s are thought to be organized in a membrane extrinsic topology.Proteins targeted to the ER and mitochondria contain distinct targeting signals, differ with respect to translational sites, and follow different targeting pathways (19Schatz G.

Proteins targeted to mitochondria are translated on cytoplasmic free ribosomes and post-translationally transported to mitochondria. The N-terminal cleavable or uncleaved amphipathic signal sequence binds to the mitochondrial outer and inner membrane translocase complexes (TOMs and TIMs, respectively) through a pathway involving the ATP-dependent Hsp70 family chaperones (19Schatz G. Dobberstein B. Science. 1996; 271: 1519-1526Crossref PubMed Scopus (917) Google Scholar, 23Ohta S. Schatz G. EMBO J. 1984; 3: 651-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). A recent study also suggested that members of the TOM complex provide the aqueous channel for protein transport across the mitochondrial outer membrane (25Hill K. Model K. Ryan M.T. Dietmeier K. Martin F. Wagner R. Pfanner N. Nature. 1998; 395: 516-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). The ER-targeted proteins, on the other hand, contain distinct N-terminal hydrophobic signals for binding to signal recognition particle, which in turn targets the emerging nascent chains to the ER (19Schatz G. Dobberstein B. Science. 1996; 271: 1519-1526Crossref PubMed Scopus (917) Google Scholar, 20Isenman L. Liebow C. Rothman S. Biochim. Biophys.

J. Cell Biol. 1981; 9: 557-561Crossref Scopus (456) Google Scholar). With few exceptions, protein targeting to the ER is thought to be co-translational (reviewed in Ref. 20Isenman L. Liebow C. Rothman S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1241: 341-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Thus, the prevailing view is that the mitochondrial or ER destination of a protein is determined at the pre-translation stage by virtue of its signal sequence property. In some cases, where the same gene products are targeted to the ER and mitochondria, the 5′ end of the mRNA sequence is altered by differential transcription using alternate transcription start sites or by differential splicing to introduce mitochondrial specific targeting signals (20Isenman L. Liebow C. Rothman S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1241: 341-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 28Boguta M. Hunter L.A. Shen W.C. Gillman E.C. Martin N.C. Hopper A.K. Mol. Cell.

Anandatheerthavarada H.K. Biswas G. Bhagwat S.V. Mullick J. Avadhani N.G. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 589-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 33Anandatheerthavarada H.K. Addya S. Mullick J. Avadhani N.G. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 1150-1160Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The mitochondrial targeted P450, exhibiting high erythromycin N-demethylase activity, was shown to render protection against erythromycin-mediated inhibition of translation in transfected COS cells (34Anandatheerthavarada H.K., C. Vijayasarathy Bhagwat S.V. Biswas G. Mullick J. Avadhani N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6617-6625Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Our results therefore suggest the existence of a novel pathway by which a primary translation product is targeted to two different cytoplasmic organelles. The mitochondrial targeting of P4501A1 involves an N-terminal endoprotease cleavage of the protein to activate a cryptic mitochondrial targeting signal. In the present study, the chimeric nature of the N-terminal signal sequence of P4501A1 (residues 1–44) was further investigated by testing the ability of this motif to target heterologous proteins, such as DHFR and mature portion of the mitochondrial P450c27, lacking the mitochondrial targeting signal, to ER and mitochondria. In addition to providing insights on the nature of the chimeric signal, our results also demonstrate that the microsomal targeted fusion protein functionally interacts with the microsome-specific electron transport protein, P450 reductase, whereas the mitochondrial targeted fusion protein interacts with Adx + Adr. These latter results shed new insights on the co-evolution of enzyme systems for mitochondrial and microsomal drug metabolism.DISCUSSIONA majority of the mitochondrial matrix targeted proteins contain N-terminal helical amphipathic sequences that are cleaved off immediately after import by a mitochondrial metalloendoprotease (57Ou W.

However, mitochondrial targeting signals ranging from non-helical to random secondary structure or mostly polar sequences have been reported (20Isenman L. Liebow C. Rothman S. Biochim. Biophys.

Results of this study therefore show that the N-terminal 1–44 sequence of P4501A1 possesses dual membrane targeting property. In support of previous results with intact P4501A1 apoprotein (32Addya S. Anandatheerthavarada H.K. Biswas G. Bhagwat S.V. Mullick J. Avadhani N.G. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 589-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), the N-terminal signal motif can target heterologous proteins, DHFR, and mature portion of P450c27 to both the ER and mitochondria under both in vivo and in vitro conditions. The N-terminal signal of P4501A1 (1–44/1A1) is chimeric in that the N-terminal most 32 residues are highly essential for ER targeting, whereas the next 12 amino acid residues (residues 33–44), containing three positively charged residues, function as a cryptic mitochondrial targeting signal.It was recently shown that BCS1 protein, the Reiske FeS protein of the bc1 complex, which is organized in a transmembrane (Nout −Cin) topology on the inner mitochondrial membrane, contains an internal targeting and a membrane anchor signal (51Folsch H. Guiard B. Neupert W. Stuart R.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 479-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). The putative mitochondrial targeting signal, rich in basic amino acid residues (residues 69–83), immediately follows the putative transmembrane domain at residues 45–68. In this respect, N-terminal signal sequence of P4501A1 resembles that of the internal signal of BCS1. In contrast to the integral membrane orientation of the BCS1 protein, however, both 1–44/1A1-mc27 and +33–44/1A1-mc27 fusion proteins targeted to mitochondria assume a membrane extrinsic topology (Fig. 6). Another notable difference is that the removal of the N-terminal transmembrane domain activates the putative mitochondrial targeting signal of the P4501A1, whereas a similar N-terminal truncation does not seem to affect the efficiency of the internal signal of BCS1 protein.The occurrence of positively charged residues is a common feature of mitochondrial targeting signals. The charged residues are usually distributed uniformly through out the length of the presequence, which ranges in size from about 15 to 45 amino acid residues (31Neupert W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 863-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (974) Google Scholar). It is thought that the positively charged N-terminal domain might be involved in binding to the negatively charged surface of the mitochondrial membrane or regions of the import receptor/translocator proteins such as Tom20 or Tom22 (64Nargang F.E. Kunkele K.-P. Mayer A. Ritzel R.G. Neupert W. Lill R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1099-1108Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 65Haucke V. Lithgow T. Rospert S. Hahne K. Schatz G. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 1995; 14: 6318-6326Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). It has also been suggested that mitochondrial processing protease contains a negatively charged surface, which is critical for the binding of precursor proteins and subsequent cleavage of the presequence (67Paces V. Rosenberg L.E. Fenton W.A. Kalousek F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5355-5358Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Although the 1–44 as well as 33–44 sequence as part of the homologous 1A1 apoprotein or chimeric fusion with reporter proteins are not cleaved by the mitochondrial endoprotease (Figs. 3 and 4), the positively charged residues at 34 and 39 positions of the signal are critical for the mitochondrial targeting function.Results of this study also point out some similarity in terms of targeting property but differences with respect to cytosolic processing of the 1–44 sequence in its native setting as part of P4501A1 as compared with its activity when fused to the N terminus of reporter protein, DHFR. Both in the native setting and as fusion of DHFR reporter, 1–44 sequence is a relatively inefficient signal for mitochondrial protein import as compared with the truncated 33–44 sequence. Previous results with endogenous P4501A1 and also that expressed in COS and C6 glioma cells (32Addya S. Anandatheerthavarada H.K. Biswas G. Bhagwat S.V. Mullick J. Avadhani N.G. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 589-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 34Anandatheerthavarada H.K., C. Vijayasarathy Bhagwat S.V. Biswas G. Mullick J. Avadhani N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6617-6625Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) showed that the mitochondrial targeting is associated with the N-terminal cleavage of the protein at the +4 and +32 positions. Results on the COS cell expression of 1–44/1A1-mc27 fusion protein, on the other hand, show no detectable shortening of the mitochondrial targeted protein (Figs. 3and 4). Inability of the cytosolic protease to process the fusion protein in vitro (results not shown) suggests that internal sequence of P4501A1 may be necessary for binding to the endoprotease. Alternatively, we cannot rule out the possibility that the fusion protein is processed at the 4th position but not at the internal site. We were unable to test the latter possibility due to technical problems of isolating sufficient amount of mitochondrial targeted fusion protein for N-terminal sequencing under transient transfection conditions.It is well established that the N-terminal 10–15 amino acid residues of various microsomal P450s are not only required for ER targeting, but they may also serve as stop transfer signals (8Sakaguchi M. Mihara K. Sato R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 3361-3364Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 9Szczesna-Skorupa E. Brown N. Mead D. Kemper B. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 108: 1237-1243Crossref Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 12Black S.D. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). This view is supported by mutations targeted to the two N-terminal most positively charged residues (2nd and 3rd residues) of P4502C2 (14Szczesna-Skorupa E. Kemper B. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 1237-1243Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which resulted in the nearly complete translocation of the protein molecule into the ER lumen. As shown in Fig. 6, 1–44/1A1-mc27 targeted to the COS cell ER appears to assume a transmembrane topology. Furthermore, although results are not presented, the ER-associated fusion protein is highly sensitive to added protease suggesting the cytosolic orientation of bulk of the molecule. In view of this, membrane extrinsic organization of the +5/1A1 protein as well as 1–44/1A1-c27 fusion protein targeted to mitochondria is highly surprising, particularly since they contain nearly intact stop-transfer and transmembrane domains. It is likely that the mitochondrial protein transport machinery is unable to recognize the stop transfer signal of 1A1, which is functional in the ER membrane system. These results suggest inherent differences between the two membrane transport systems.Results of this study also shed light as to how the same protein can assume different topological orientation in two different cytoplasmic membrane compartments, which could also be the basis for differences in their catalytic properties and also mode of interaction with different electron transfer proteins. A distinctive feature of the microsomal and mitochondrial P450s is thought to be their requirements for specific electron transfer proteins, the microsomal P450 reductase, and the soluble ferridoxin and ferridoxin reductase systems, respectively. In exception to this generality, microsomal P450c17, was shown to be fully active with bacterial flavodoxin and flavodoxin reductase (68Jenkins C.M. Waterman M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27401-27408Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, bacterially expressed N-terminal truncated P4501A2 showed activity in both bacterial flavodoxin + flavodoxin reductase, as well as ferridoxin + ferridoxin reductase (69Dong M.S. Yamazaki H. Guo Z. Guengrich F.P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 327: 11-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). More recently, P450MT2 (N-terminal truncated 1A1) purified from BNF-induced liver mitochondria and also bacterially expressed +33/1A1 were shown to undergo functionally productive interaction with Adx and Adr proteins by multiple criteria. However, studies showing the productive interaction of bona fide mitochondrial P450s with P450 reductase have been relatively rare. A recent study showed that a chimeric fusion protein consisting of N-terminal signal sequence of microsomal P450c17 and mature protein of P450c27, when expressed in yeast cells, is correctly targeted to the ER membrane (70Sakaki T. Kominami S. Hayashi K. Akiyoshi-Shibata M. Yabusaki Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26209-26213Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The extent of mitochondrial targeting of this fusion protein was not investigated. Surprisingly, the microsomal associated P450c27 showed catalytic activity in a P450 reductase system. However, results in our own and others' laboratories (32Addya S. Anandatheerthavarada H.K. Biswas G. Bhagwat S.V. Mullick J. Avadhani N.G. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 589-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 46Stravitz R.T. Vlahcevic Z.R. Russell T. Heizer M.L. Avadhani N.G. J. Steroid Biochem. Molec.

Biophys. 1997; 343: 123-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) showed that bacterially expressed mature form of P450c27 or that purified from mitochondria exhibit negligible activity in a P450 reductase supported system. These contrasting results raised the possibility that a productive interaction with the microsomal P450 reductase is facilitated only when mitochondrial P450c27 assumes a transmembrane orientation. Our results with the 1–44/1A1-mc27 fusion protein expression system show that in a membrane-anchored orientation, P450c27 is able to interact with similarly organized P450 reductase, whereas in its membrane extrinsic orientation in the mitochondrial compartment, it can effectively interact with the soluble electron transfer proteins, Adx + Adr. This possibility is further supported by previous studies showing that N-terminal truncation of P450 reductase significantly reduced its ability to support the activity of microsomal P450s (71Larson J.R. Coon M.J. Porter T.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7321-7324Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 72Black S.D. Coon M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 5929-5938Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).In summary our results provide direct and conclusive evidence on the dual targeting properties of the N-terminal signal sequence of P4501A1. Additionally, in conjunction with the results of Sakaki et al. (70Sakaki T. Kominami S. Hayashi K. Akiyoshi-Shibata M. Yabusaki Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26209-26213Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) results presented in this study provide new insights on the mode of interaction of mitochondrial P450s with P450 reductase, organized in a transmembrane orientation. These results have implications on the evolutionary relationship between the mitochondrial and microsomal P450 system and their specific electron transport proteins. Cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (P450s)1 are widely distributed in the biological kingdom and constitute a superfamily of heme proteins, which catalyze the metabolism of drugs, toxic chemicals, and an array of physiological substrates (1Porter T.D. Coon M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 266: 13469-13472Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar, 2Guengerich F.P Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol.

In metazoan organisms, P450s involved in the physiological pathways, and also the inducible P450s, implicated in the xenobiotic metabolism are predominantly localized in the ER (routinely referred to as microsomal P450), as well as mitochondria of liver and a number of extrahepatic tissues (1Porter T.D.

Biophys. 1998; 359: 231-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Models on the topological organization of microsomal P450s suggest that the heme protein is anchored on the ER membrane through a single transmembrane domain, with most part of the protein facing the cytosolic side (8Sakaguchi M. Mihara K. Sato R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 3361-3364Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 9Szczesna-Skorupa E. Brown N. Mead D. Kemper B. J.

Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 457-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). It is believed that only a short N-terminal segment (5–10 amino acid residues) of the P450 faces the ER lumen. Some studies also suggest additional extrinsic interaction of cytoplasmic exposed P450 domains with the lipid bilayer (12Black S.D. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The N-terminal 35–40 residues of different microsomal P450s are thought to provide the transmembrane anchor, in addition to stop transfer signal for membrane insertion (9Szczesna-Skorupa E. Brown N.

https://openalex.org/W2070378260,"Histone deacetylases (HDACs) are involved in the deacetylation of core histones, which is an important event in transcription regulation in eukaryotes through alterations in the chromatin structure. We cloned cDNAs and genomic DNAs encoding two chicken HDACs (chHDAC-1 and -2), which are preferentially localized in nuclei. Treatment with trichostatin A reduced the HDAC activities in immunoprecipitates obtained with anti-chHDAC-1 and -2 antisera. Using gene targeting techniques, we generated homozygous DT40 mutants, ΔchHDAC-1 and -2, devoid of two alleles of the <i>chHDAC-1</i> and -<i>2</i> genes, respectively. The protein patterns on two-dimensional PAGE definitely changed for ΔchHDAC-2, and the amounts of the IgM H- and L-chains increased in it. Of the two IgM H-chain forms, the secreted form (μs) increased in ΔchHDAC-2, but the membrane-bound form (μm) decreased. The IgM H-chain gene was transcribed more in ΔchHDAC-2 than in DT40 cells. In the mutant, the alternative processing of IgM H-chain pre-mRNA preferentially occurred, resulting in an increase in the amount of μs mRNA, whereas the stability of the two types of mRNA, μs and μm, was unchanged. In DT40 cells, treatment with trichostatin A increased both the amounts of IgM H-chain mRNAs and the switch from μm to μs mRNAs. Based on these results, we propose a model for a role of chHDAC-2 in both the transcription and alternative processing steps, resulting in control of the amount of the μs IgM H-chain in the DT40 cell line."

Dinucleoside polyphosphates were purified by anion-exchange and reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography to homogeneity. Analysis of one of these fractions with matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry revealed a molecular mass of 1076.4 (1077.4 = [M + H]+) Da. UV spectroscopic analysis of this fraction showed the spectrum of an adenosine derivative. Comparison of the postsource decay matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrum of the fraction minus that of diadenosine heptaphosphate (Ap7A) demonstrated that the isolated substance was identical to Ap7A. The identity of the retention times of the authentic and the isolated compound confirmed this result. Enzymatic analysis demonstrated an interconnection of the phosphate groups with the adenosines in the 5′-positions of the riboses. With thrombin-induced platelet aggregation, Ap7A is released from the platelets into the extracellular space. The vasoconstrictive action of Ap7A on the vasculature of the isolated perfused rat kidney Ap7A was slightly less than that of Ap6A.

The vasoconstrictive effect was abolished by suramin and pyridoxal phosphate 6-azophenyl-2′,4′-disulfonic acid, suggesting an activation of P2x receptors.

Diadenosine tri- and tetraphosphate (Ap3A and Ap4A)1 were the first dinucleoside polyphosphates to be identified in human platelets (3Lüthje J. Ogilvie A. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Recently, further dinucleoside polyphosphates containing adenosine and guanosine (ApnG;n = 3–6) or containing two guanosines (GpnG;n = 3–6) were discovered in human platelets (8Schlüter H. Gross I.

ApnG (n = 5 or 6) are vasoactive also, whereas GpnG have no vasoconstrictive effect on the isolated perfused rat kidney.

In this study, anion exchange chromatography revealed an unidentified UV absorbance at a retention time of 56 min. In the present study, a diadenosine polyphosphate containing seven phosphate groups was isolated by testing chromatographic fractions of human platelet extracts for vasoconstrictive effects on the isolated perfused rat kidney. In the following, the identification of diadenosine heptaphosphate (Ap7A) of human platelets and the characterization of the vasoactive effect of this substance is described. HPLC water (gradient grade) and acetonitrile were purchased from Merck (Germany), and all other substances were from Sigma (Germany). First, human platelets were washed with an isotonic solution of NaCl and centrifuged (4000 rpm, 4 °C, 10 min) twice (step 1). The supernatant was aspirated, and the pellets were frozen to −30 °C. The platelet pellets were rethawed in bidistilled water (10 ml). The resulting suspension was deproteinated with 0.6 mol/liter (final concentration) perchloric acid and centrifuged (4000 rpm, 4 °C, 5 min) (step 2). After adjusting the pH to 7.0 with 5 mol/liter KOH, the precipitated proteins and KClO4 were removed by centrifugation (4000 rpm, 4 °C, 5 min). 1 mol/liter triethylammonium acetate (TEAA) in water was added to the supernatant to a final concentration of 40 mmol/liter. The mixture was loaded to a preparative reversed phase column (step 3; Lichroprep RP-18 B, Merck; equilibration and sample buffer: 40 mmol/liter TEAA in water; flow rate: 5 ml/min). Nucleotides were eluted by 20% acetonitrile in water. The lyophilized eluate of the reversed phase chromatography dissolved in 1 mol/liter ammonium acetate (pH 9.5) was loaded to a phenyl boronic acid resin (step 4). The resin was prepared according to Barnes et al. (9Barnes L.D. Robinson A.K. Mumford C.H. Garrison P.N. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 144: 296-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The absorbed substances were eluted with 1 mmol/liter HCl (flow rate: 1 ml/min). The eluate from the phenyl boronic acid resin with 1 mol/liter TEAA to a final concentration of 40 mmol/liter added was desalted (step 5) by a reversed phase chromatography (Lichroprep RP-18 B, Merck; equilibration and sample buffer: 40 mmol/liter TEAA in water; flow rate: 5 ml/min). The lyophilized eluate was chromatographed (step 6) by anion exchange chromatography (TSK DEAE 5 PW 150 × 20 mm; Tosohaas (Japan); eluent A: 20 mmol/liter K2HPO4, pH 8; eluent B: 20 mmol/liter K2HPO4, pH 8, and 1 mol/liter NaCl in water; gradient: 0–10 min 0–5% B, 10–105 min 5–35% B, 105–110 min 35–100% B; flow rate: 2.0 ml/min). Fractions were collected according to UV absorbance at 254 nm (peak fractionation). Each fraction of the anion exchange chromatography with a significant UV absorbance at 254 nm was further chromatographed (step 7) on a reversed phase column (Superspher RP-18 end-capped, 250 × 4 mm, Merck; eluent A: 40 mmol/liter TEAA in water; eluent B: acetonitrile; gradient: 0–4 min 0–4% B, 4–64 min 4–11% B, 64–70 min 11–70% B; flow rate: 0.5 ml/min). Fractions with a significant UV absorption were rechromatographed using the conditions described (step 8). The lyophilized fractions from the reversed phase chromatography were examined by MALDI-MS and postsource decay (PSD)-MALDI-MS. A reflectron type time-of-flight mass spectrometer (Reflex III, Bruker, Germany) was used according to Hillenkamp and Karas (10Hillenkamp F. Karas M. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 193: 280-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). The sample was mounted on an x, y, z movable stage allowing irradiation of selected sample areas. In this study, a nitrogen laser (VSL-337 ND, Laser Science) with an emission wavelength of 337 nm and 3-ns pulse duration was used. The laser beam was focused to a typical diameter of 50 μm at an angle of 45° to the surface of a target. Microscopic sample observation was possible. 10–20 single spectra were accumulated for a better signal-to-noise ratio. In MALDI-MS, large fractions of the desorbed analyte ions undergo PSD during flight in the field free drift path. Using a reflectron type time-of-flight set-up, sequence information from PSD fragment ions of precursors produced by MALDI were obtained (11Kaufmann R. Kirsch D. Spengler B. Int. J. Mass Spectrom. Ion Proc. 1994; 131: 355-385Crossref Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Sample preparation for MALDI and PSD-MALDI experiments was identical. The concentrations of the analyzed substances were 1–10 μmol/liter in double distilled water. 1 μl of the analyte solution was mixed with 1 μl of matrix solution (50 mg/ml 3-hydroxypicolinic acid in water). To this mixture, cation exchange beads (AG 50 W-X12, 200–400-mesh, Bio-Rad) equilibrated with NH4+ as counter ion were added to remove Na+ and K+ ions. The mixture was gently dried on an inert metal surface before introduction into the mass spectrometer. The mass accuracy was approximately 0.01%. The substances purified to homogeneity by reversed phase chromatography were dissolved in 100 μl of water (pH 6.5) and were analyzed by a UV spectrometer (UV-visible spectrophotometer model DU-600, Beckman). The UV absorption was scanned from 400 to 190 nm with a scan speed of 200 nm/min. Ap7A was synthesized in a modification of the method of Ng and Orgel (12Ng K.E. Orgel L.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 3573-3580Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) using ATP and ATep as educts. A 10 mmol/liter concentration of each mononucleotide was mixed with 2.5 mol/liter 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide in an aqueous solution containing 2 mol/liter HEPES and 50 mmol/liter MgCl2. The pH was adjusted to 6.5. The reaction mixture was incubated for 24 h at 37 °C. The reaction products were concentrated on a preparative C18 reversed phase gel (Lichroprep RP-18 B, Merck). The nucleotides were eluted from the C18 gel by 30% acetonitrile in water. The eluate of the reversed phase chromatography was lyophilized and dissolved in 10 mmol/liter K2HPO4, pH 8 (eluent A) and was fractionated by an anion exchange column (Mono Q HR 10/10, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech (Sweden); eluent A: 20 mmol/liter K2HPO4, pH 8; eluent B: 20 mmol/liter K2HPO4, pH 8, with 1 mol/liter NaCl in water; gradient: 0–10 min 0–20% B, 10–145 min 10–40% B, 145–150 min 40–100% B; flow rate: 1.0 ml/min). Each fraction of the anion exchange chromatography showing a significant UV absorbance at 254 nm was desalted on a reversed phase column (Superspher RP-18 end-capped, 300 × 8 mm, Merck; eluent A: 40 mmol/liter TEAA in water; eluent B: 30% acetonitrile in water; flow rate: 1.0 ml/min). The fraction containing Ap7A was identified by MALDI-MS. Aliquots of the desalted and rechromatographed fractions of the anion exchange chromatography (step 8 of the purification procedure) were incubated with enzymes as follows. The samples were dissolved (a) in 20 μl of 200 mmol/liter Tris buffer (pH 8.9) and incubated with 5′-nucleotide hydrolase (3 milliunits; from Crotalus durissus, EC 3.1.15.1, from Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Germany; purified according to Sulkowski and Laskowski (13Sulkowski E. Laskowski S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1971; 240: 443-447Crossref Scopus (105) Google Scholar) 9 min at 37 °C); (b) in 20 μl of 200 mmol/liter Tris and 20 mmol/liter EDTA buffer (pH 7.4) and incubated with 3′-nucleotide hydrolase (1 milliunit; from calf spleen, EC 3.1.16.1, from Roche Molecular Biochemicals) 1 h at 37 °C; and (c) in 20 μl of 10 mmol/liter Tris, 1 mmol/liter ZnCl2, and 1 mmol/liter MgCl2 buffer (pH 8) and incubated with alkaline phosphatase (1 milliunit; EC3.1.3.1, from calf intestinal mucosa, from Roche Molecular Biochemicals) 1 h at 37 °C. The reaction was terminated by an ultrafiltration with a centrifuge filter (exclusion limit of 10 kDa). After filtration of the enzymatic cleavage products, the filtrate, dissolved in 80 μl of eluent A, was subjected to the anion exchange chromatography (Mini Q PC 3.2/3; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech; eluent A: 20 mmol/liter K2HPO4, pH 8; eluent B: 20 mmol/liter K2HPO4, pH 8, with 1 mol/liter NaCl; gradient: 0–2 min 0–0% B, 2–27 min 0–40% B, 27–28 min 40–100% B, 28–30 min 100% B; flow rate: 0.1 ml/min. The effect of aliquots of the desalted and rechromatographed fractions of the anion exchange chromatography as well as authentic dinucleoside polyphosphates on vascular tone was evaluated in an isolated rat kidney perfused with a constant flow of 8–9 ml/min while perfusion pressure was continuously monitored. Details of the preparation are given elsewhere (14van der Giet M. Khattab M. Borgel J. Schlüter H. Zidek W. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1997; 120: 1453-1460Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The kidney was excised and immediately mounted into the perfusion system. The perfusion procedure generally followed the description given by van der Giet et al. (14van der Giet M. Khattab M. Borgel J. Schlüter H. Zidek W. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1997; 120: 1453-1460Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Briefly, the isolated rat kidney was perfused by a peristaltic pump in a single pass system with a solution containing 115 mmol/liter NaCl, 4.6 mmol/liter KCl, 1 mmol/liter CaCl2, 1.2 mmol/liter MgSO4, 1.2 mmol/liter NaH2PO4, 22 mmol/liter NaHCO3, 49 mmol/liter glucose, and 35 g of gelatine/liter (Hemaccel; Behringwerke, Marburg, Germany) and equilibrated with 95% O2, 5% CO2. The perfusion medium and the kidney were kept constant at 37 °C. Perfusion flow was constant at 8–9 ml/min. Perfusion pressure was continuously monitored by a transducer (Gould P23) connected to a bridge amplifier (Hugo Sachs, Freiburg, Germany). Vasoconstrictor responses of the isolated perfused rat kidney to Ap6A, Ap7A, and α,β-methylene ATP were assessed at basal tone after an equilibration period of 30 min. For each substance, dose-response curves were constructed, with 5 min allowed to elapse between consecutive doses. The nonspecific P2 purinoceptor antagonist suramin (100 μmol/liter) and the P2x purinoceptor antagonist pyridoxal phosphate 6-azophenyl-2′,4′-disulfonic acid (PPADS, 30 μmol/liter) were added to the perfusate 30 min before challenge with mono- or dinucleotides. Furthermore, P2x receptors were specifically occupied by continuous perfusion of the kidney with 10−5 mol/liter α,β-methylene ATP. This agent, which is a specific P2xreceptor agonist, is known to occupy P2x receptor for any further activation. Three platelet concentrates were suspended in 300 ml of a 0.9% NaCl solution and divided into two parts. One of the parts was incubated with thrombin (0.05 units/ml) for 1 min. After this, the platelets were removed by centrifugation (4000 rpm, 4 °C, 10 min). The supernatant was deproteinated with 0.6 mol/liter (final concentration) perchloric acid and centrifuged (4000 rpm, 4 °C, 5 min). After adjusting pH to 7.0 with 5 mol/liter KOH, the precipitated proteins and KClO4 were removed by centrifugation (4000 rpm, 4 °C, 5 min). The supernatants of both parts of the platelets concentrates were chromatographed according to steps 3–6. The dimension and gradient of the anion exchange chromatography were modified. Conditions were as follows: column: Mono Q PC 3.2/2, 32 × 2 mm, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech; eluent A: 20 mmol/liter K2HPO4, pH 8; eluent B: 20 mmol/liter K2HPO4 plus 1 mol/liter NaCl, pH 8; gradient: 0–2 min 0–0% B, 2–27 min 0–40% B, 27–28 min 40–100% B, 28–30 min 100% B; flow rate: 0.1 ml/min. Ap7A was identified by retention time comparison with authentic Ap7A as well as MALDI-MS. The concentration of Ap7A was estimated using a calibration curve of Ap7A. Venous blood was obtained from healthy volunteers who had not used antiplatelet aggregation drugs for at least 2 weeks and was collected into heparinized sample tubes (Sarstedt, Germany). Platelet-rich plasma was separated from the blood sample by centrifugation at 1000 rpm for 10 min at room temperature. Platelets in the supernatant were counted on a Coulter MD II hematology analyzer (Coulter, Germany) and adjusted with platelet-poor plasma to 250,000 platelets/μl. Platelet-poor plasma was prepared from the pellet obtained in the first centrifugation step, after a further centrifugation at 4000 rpm for 10 min (room temperature). Platelet aggregation studies were performed using the turbidimetric method according to Born (15Born G.V.R. Cross M.J. J. Physiol. 1963; 168: 178-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (1843) Google Scholar) in a four-channel aggregometer (Labor, Germany). The instrument was adjusted with platelet-poor plasma to 100% and platelet-rich plasma to 0% of relative light transmission. Samples and reagents were prewarmed to 37 °C. Aggregatory effects of Ap7A (final concentrations from 0.15 to 10 μmol/liter) were investigated using 10 μmol/liter ADP and 0.9% NaCl (DiaMed, Switzerland) as controls. Immediately after the addition of Ap7A, ADP, or NaCl to platelet-rich plasma, relative light transmission was recorded. For inhibition experiments, platelet-rich plasma was preincubated for 2 min with different amounts of Ap5A, Ap6A, and Ap7A (up to 10 μmol/liter). After the addition of ADP (final concentration 1 μmol/liter), relative light transmission was recorded. Means ± S.E. of maximum aggregation (maximal relative light transmission) were calculated of 4–7 independent experiments. Human platelets deproteinated with perchloric acid were concentrated by ion pair reversed phase chromatography. The affinity chromatography of the eluate by phenyl-boronic acid resin offers the possibility of the separation of mononucleoside and dinucleoside polyphosphates (8Schlüter H. Gross I. Bachmann J. Kaufmann R. van der Giet M. Tepel M. Nofer J.R. Assmann G. Karas M. Jankowski J. Zidek W. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 682-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 9Barnes L.D. Robinson A.K. Mumford C.H. Garrison P.N. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 144: 296-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The desalted and lyophilized eluate was fractionated by anion exchange chromatography. The anion exchange chromatogram is given in Fig.1 A. The molecular mass of underlying substances of each peak was determined by MALDI-MS. All except the peak labeled by an arrow in Fig.1 A belong to known dinucleoside polyphosphates like Ap3A (3Lüthje J. Ogilvie A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1983; 115: 253-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), Ap4A (4Flodgaard H. Klenow H. Biochem. J. 1982; 208: 737-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar), Ap5A, and Ap6A (7Schlüter H. Offers E. Brüggemann G. van der Giet M. Tepel M. Nordhoff E. Karas M. Spieker C. Witzel H. Zidek W. Nature. 1994; 367: 186-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar) as well as ApnG and GpnG (with n = 3–6) (8Schlüter H. Gross I. Bachmann J. Kaufmann R. van der Giet M. Tepel M. Nofer J.R. Assmann G. Karas M. Jankowski J. Zidek W. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 682-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Only the labeled peak (Fig.1 A) had not been identified earlier and had a vasoconstrictive effect in the isolated perfused rat kidney. Therefore, in the following only the identification of the peak at 86.8 min (Fig.1 A) is described. Fig. 1 B shows a typical chromatogram of a reversed phase chromatography from the peak labeled in Fig. 1 A. The substance eluting at a retention time of 56 min had a vasoconstrictive effect on the isolated perfused rat kidney (data not shown). Therefore, this fraction was rechromatographed by reversed phase chromatography using the same conditions as before. In the last chromatographic step, a single UV peak was obtained (Fig. 1 C). The UV spectrum of the isolated fraction was essentially identical to that of adenosine, confirming that a nucleotide containing adenosine was present in the isolated fraction (data not shown). In Fig. 2 A, the PSD-MALDI-MS spectrum of the fraction labeled by an arrow in Fig.1 C is shown. The molecular mass of the isolated substance was determined as 1076.4 (1077.4 = [M + H]+) Da by this PSD-MALDI-MS spectrum (Fig. 2 A). This molecular mass as well as the fragments corresponds to that of authentic Ap7A (Fig. 2 B). Retention time of the isolated fraction (Fig.3 A) was identical to that of authentic Ap7A (labeled in Fig. 3 E). To answer the question how the phosphoesters are connected to the riboses of the adenosines, the products generated by nucleotide hydrolase digestion and alkaline phosphatase were analyzed. Incubation of the isolated molecules with alkaline phosphatase (Fig. 3 B) or 3′-nucleotide hydrolase (calf spleen) (Fig. 3 C) yielded no cleavage products. When Ap7A recovered from biological extracts was treated with 5′-nucleotide hydrolase (Crotalus durissus), the initial peak of Ap7A decreased, and the hydrolysis products AMP and adenosine hexaphosphate appeared (Fig. 3 D). The cleavage pattern was identical with that of authentic Ap7A (Fig. 3 E). The results of the enzymatic cleavage experiments demonstrate that the polyphosphate chain interconnects the two adenosines via phosphoester bonds to the 5′-positions of the riboses.Figure 3Enzymatic cleavage experiments. Anion exchange chromatograms of the fraction of reversed phase rechromatography labeled in Fig. 1 C before (A) and after incubation with alkaline phosphatase (B), with 3′-nucleotidase (C) and with 5′-nucleotidase (D).E shows the chromatogram of authentic Ap7A after incubation with 5′-nucleotidase. Conditions were as follows: column: Mono Q PC 3.2/2, 32 × 2 mm, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech; eluent A: 20 mmol/liter K2HPO4, pH 8; eluent B: 20 mmol/liter K2HPO4 plus 1 mol/liter NaCl, pH 8; gradient: 0–2 min 0–0% B, 2–27 min 0–40% B, 27–28 min 40–100% B, 28–30 min 100% B; flow rate: 0.1 ml/min.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) After platelet aggregation with thrombin, Ap7A is released into the extracellular space. Fig. 4shows the anion exchange chromatogram before (Fig. 4 A) and after platelet aggregation with thrombin (Fig. 4 B). Ap7A can be found in the supernatant after platelet aggregation (labeled in Fig. 4 B by an arrow). The extracellular concentration of Ap7A can be estimated by the UV peak in the range of 0.05–0.1 μmol/liter after thrombin stimulation. The concentration of Ap7A in the supernatant of untreated platelet extract was lower than the detection limit (detection limit was <5 nmol/liter; Fig. 4). Furthermore, the amounts of diadenosine polyphosphates released were determined in relation to the total amounts. The portion released upon platelet aggregation was estimated as 60% for each diadenosine polyphosphate. At basal tone, Ap7A caused a dose-dependent vasoconstriction (Fig. 5 A). The vasoconstrictor EC50 value (mol/liter) of Ap7A ((5.34 ± 1.77) × 10−4) was higher than the EC50 value of Ap5A ((1.07 ± 0.05) × 10−5), Ap6A ((1.86 ± 0.28) × 10−5), and α,β-methylene ATP ((8.08 ± 0.53) × 10−6) (Fig. 5 A). The minimal effective concentration of Ap7A was less than 10−5 mol/liter. Ap7A is less effective on the vascular resistance of the isolated perfused rat kidney than α,β-methylene ATP, Ap5A, or Ap6A. In the presence of suramin (100 μmol/liter) and PPADS (30 μmol/liter), the responses of kidney vasculature to Ap6A and Ap7A were completely abolished. The response of Ap7A in the presence and absence of PPADS and suramin is shown in Fig. 5, B and C, respectively. Incubation of the isolated perfused rat kidney with α,β-methylene ATP abolished the vasoconstrictive effect of Ap7A (Fig.6). Since no vasodilator response to Ap7A was seen, even after vascular tone was increased by α,β-methylene ATP, no further antagonists specific for P2Y receptors were tested. Conversely, the vasoconstrictive effect of angiotensin II was not affected under continuous perfusion with α,β-methylene ATP. Ap7A has no direct effect on aggregation of isolated platelets (data not shown). However, the ADP-induced platelet aggregation is inhibited by Ap7A. The concentration dependence of Ap7A on the inhibition of ADP-induced platelet aggregation is shown in Fig. 7. The IC50 value of Ap7A on the inhibitory effect of ADP aggregation was calculated at (2.94 ± 0.88) × 10−6 mol/liter; the value for Ap6A was (2.68 ± 0.74) × 10−6 mol/liter; and the value for Ap5A was (4.06 ± 0.92) × 10−6mol/liter. In the last decade, diadenosine polyphosphates ApnA (n = 3–6) received considerable attention in view of their multiple biological and pharmacological activities. Besides their role in platelet aggregation (16Ogilvie A. Blasius R. Schulze-Lohoff E. Sterzel R.B. J. Auton. Pharmacol. 1996; 16: 325-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), diadenosine polyphosphates have potent vasoconstrictive and vasodilator properties. The vasoactive actions of diadenosine polyphosphates were demonstrated in numerous vascular models (17Schlüter H. Tepel M. Zidek W. J. Auton. Pharmacol. 1996; 16: 357-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Comparison of the various diadenosine polyphosphates reveals that the action of these compounds on vasculature depends on the number of phosphate groups. Accordingly, vasodilation can be observed in intact vessels after administration of Ap2A, Ap3A, and Ap4A, whereas Ap5A and Ap6A are vasoconstrictive (17Schlüter H. Tepel M. Zidek W. J. Auton. Pharmacol. 1996; 16: 357-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Our results demonstrate for the first time a diadenosine polyphosphate with a vasoconstrictive effect with seven phosphate groups. The vasoconstrictive effect of Ap7A is comparable with the effect of Ap5A, the diadenosine polyphosphate with the most intensive vasoconstrictive effect known (7Schlüter H. Offers E. Brüggemann G. van der Giet M. Tepel M. Nordhoff E. Karas M. Spieker C. Witzel H. Zidek W. Nature. 1994; 367: 186-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). To the best of our knowledge, unlike diadenosine polyphosphates ApnA with n = 3–6, Ap7A has not been isolated from any tissue so far. The question arises of how this substance is biosynthesized. In general, four classes of enzymes are known to synthesize dinucleoside polyphosphates in vitro (for a review, see Ref. 18Plateau P. Blanquet S. McLennan A.G. Ap4A and Other Dinucleosides Polyphosphates. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1992: 63-79Google Scholar): Ap4A phosphorylases, luciferases, guanylyl transferases, and the aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases. However, these enzymes are not capable of producing of dinucleoside polyphosphates in vivo. In vivo Ap4A is enzymatically synthesized from ATP and lysine by lysyl-sRNA synthetase. This pathway was shown using baby hamster kidney cells, salmonella, and Escherichia coli (18Plateau P. Blanquet S. McLennan A.G. Ap4A and Other Dinucleosides Polyphosphates. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1992: 63-79Google Scholar). Principally, this pathway is also capable of producing Ap7A. Alternatively, a nonenzymatic synthesis may be considered. Given that mostly mononucleotides such as ATP are found together with biogenic amines such as catecholamines, the coexistence of both nucleotides and amines within the same subcellular localization may be due to the type of nonenzymatic reaction generating diadenosine polyphosphates. From ATP and a biogenic amine, a phosphoramidate may be generated, which is a highly reactive intermediate. A further reaction with another ATP could then yield Ap6A. However, also diadenosine polyphosphates with a higher length of the phosphate chain could be produced by this reaction, if an additional step to add phosphates to the phosphoramidate is assumed. The experiment with the P2 purinoceptor antagonist, suramin, and the P2x purinoceptor antagonist, PPADS, suggests that the vasoconstrictive action of Ap7A is due to activation of P2x purinoceptors. During perfusion with maximally effective concentrations of α,β-methylene ATP, Ap7A did not further increase vascular resistance. These experiments further support the view that Ap7A produces vasoconstriction via P2x purinoceptors. Because P2x1 receptors have been identified in rat kidney (19Chan C.M. Unwin R.J. Bardini M. Oglesby I.B. Ford A.P. Townsend-Nicholson A. Burnstock G. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: F799-F804Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and α,β-methylene ATP is a specific agonist for the P2x1subtype (20MacKenzie A.B. Mahaut-Smith M.P. Sage S.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2879-2881Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar), the vasoconstrictive effect of Ap7A is probably mediated by the P2x1 subtype. Principally, Ap7A appears to act by the same mechanisms as Ap5A and Ap6A (14van der Giet M. Khattab M. Borgel J. Schlüter H. Zidek W. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1997; 120: 1453-1460Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The latter diadenosine polyphosphates were shown to exert vasoconstriction via the P2x purinoceptor, whereas Ap2A and Ap3A are vasodilators, acting via A2 receptors (5Busse R. Ogilvie A. Pohl U. Am. J. Physiol. 1988; 254: H828-H832PubMed Google Scholar). Chan et al. (19Chan C.M. Unwin R.J. Bardini M. Oglesby I.B. Ford A.P. Townsend-Nicholson A. Burnstock G. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: F799-F804Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) further characterized the P2x receptor in rat kidney vasculature as the P2x subtype. Present results strongly suggest that Ap7A also activates this P2x purinoceptor subtype. Compared with Ap5A and Ap6A, its receptor affinity as estimated from the EC50 value appears to be less, suggesting that the optimal length of the phosphate chain to activate the P2x purinoceptor may be five phosphates. Because of the different vascular effects of diadenosine polyphosphates, depending on the number of phosphate groups, it may be speculated that for both adenosine moieties in the molecules an optimal distance exists to have a vasoconstrictive effect. The EC50value of Ap5A and Ap6A indicates a slightly higher receptor affinity of Ap5A and Ap6A than of Ap7A, suggesting that the optimal distance between the adenosine moieties of the known endogenous diadenosine polyphosphates is achieved with five phosphate groups. After the biochemical characterization, the question arose of whether the concentration range of Ap7A used in the isolated perfused rat kidney is physiologically relevant. Compared with ATP, which can easily be identified in chromatograms of platelet extracts, the concentration of Ap7A may be in the range of1200 to 1500 ATP. Earlier experiments showed that about 80% of diadenosine polyphosphates of platelets are released during aggregation (21Agha A. Schlüter H. Konig S. Biel K. Tepel M. Zidek W. J. Vasc. Res. 1992; 29: 281-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Obviously, the diadenosine polyphosphate concentration occurring in extracellular space after platelet aggregation depends on the volume of distribution, but the intraplatelet concentrations suggest that in the close environment of platelet thrombus similar diadenosine polyphosphate concentrations can be found as in platelets. In particular, platelets and chromaffin granules of the adrenal medulla have rather high concentrations of diadenosine polyphosphates (ApnA; n = 3–6), which was up to 6 mmol/liter. Local extracellular concentration of up to 100 μmol/liter have been assumed (22Ogilvie A. McLennan A.G. Ap4A and Other Dinucleoside Polyphosphates. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1992: 229-273Google Scholar). The physiological role of Ap7A is still unclear. Like ApnA (n = 3–6), (3Lüthje J. Ogilvie A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1983; 115: 253-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 4Flodgaard H. Klenow H. Biochem. J. 1982; 208: 737-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 8Schlüter H. Gross I. Bachmann J. Kaufmann R. van der Giet M. Tepel M. Nofer J.R. Assmann G. Karas M. Jankowski J. Zidek W. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 682-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), Ap7A is released by platelet aggregation. Furthermore, Ap7A may thereby reach extracellular concentrations sufficient to affect vasculature, as estimated from the concentration-response curves in the isolated perfused rat kidney. The experiments revealed a lower EC50 of Ap7A compared with Ap5A and Ap6A. Obviously, in the sigmoidal part of the concentration-response curve, Ap7A has weaker effects than Ap5A and Ap6A. However, this does not necessarily imply that the extracellular effects of Ap7A are negligible; e.g. due to the long phosphate chain, the affinity of hydrolases may be lower and hence the extracellular half-life may be longer than that of the other diadenosine polyphosphates. Therefore, Ap7A may be involved in local changes of perfusion induced by platelet aggregation. Ap7A inhibits ADP-induced platelet activation which is mediated via the P2Y1 and P2TAC receptor (23Kunapuli S.P. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1998; 19: 391-394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Inhibition of platelet aggregation by diadenosine polyphosphates was proposed to be due to competition between the dinucleotides and ADP at a specific receptor site on the platelet membrane (24Harrison M.J. Brossmer R. Goody R.S. FEBS Lett. 1975; 54: 57-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), which, according to experiments with a recombinant P2Y1 receptor, is not identical with the latter (25Pintor J. King B.F. Miras-Portugal M.T. Burnstock G. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1996; 119: 1006-1012Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Therefore the inhibitory action may be developed at the P2TAC receptor. Ap5A has the highest inhibitory activity on platelet aggregation, followed by Ap6A and Ap7A. This is in good agreement with the results of Harrison et al. (24Harrison M.J. Brossmer R. Goody R.S. FEBS Lett. 1975; 54: 57-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Like the other diadenosine polyphosphates, Ap7A may not only occur in platelets, but also in adrenal medulla and sympathetic nerve endings, although no attempts have been made to isolate Ap7A from cells other than platelets. Assuming the same widespread occurrence of Ap7A as of the other analogues, a role as sympathetic co-transmitter may be discussed. However, the physiological concentrations of Ap7A appear to be lower than those of Ap5A and Ap6A, at least in human platelets. At present, potential differences in the effects of Ap5A, Ap6A, and Ap7A have not been studied yet. In summary, Ap7A isolated from human platelets appears to be a potent vasoconstrictor whose vasoconstrictive effect is mediated by a P2x receptor, possibly by the P2x1 subtype of this receptor.

This work addresses the questions of what factors influence de novo methylation, and whether the integration site or inserted DNA can affect de novo methylation. Homologous recombination was used to integrate foreign DNA into a specific gene, B lymphocyte kinase (BLK), in mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells. Two plasmids were chosen for integration; one contained the adenovirus type 2 E2AL promoter upstream of the luciferase reporter gene, and the second carried the early SV40 promoter. The methylation patterns were analyzed using Hpa II and Msp I restriction endonucleases for both homologously recombined and randomly integrated foreign DNA in the ES cell clones.Upon homologous reinsertion of the BLK gene into the genome of mouse ES cells, methylation patterns in this gene were reestablished. In DNA segments adjoined to the BLK gene, the de novo patterns of DNA methylation depended on the viral sequences in these clones and on the locations of the inserts, i.e. on whether the insertions resulted from homologously recombined or randomly integrated foreign DNA. In homologously recombined DNA, sequences carrying the adenovirus type 2 promoter were heavily methylated, and those with an SV40 promoter and an SV40 enhancer element remained unmethylated or hypomethylated. Upon removal of the enhancer element, these inserted constructs also became heavily methylated. In addition, all randomly integrated constructs were heavily methylated independently of the promoter and enhancer element present in the construct. These results indicate that modes and sites of integration as well as the inserted nucleotide sequence, possibly promoter strength, are factors affecting de novo methylation.

Adenovirus (Ad)1 DNA has been used as a model system to study the effects of foreign DNA integration and methylation on host and Ad gene expression (2Doerfler W. Annu. Rev.

The Ad genome is 34–36 kb in size and consists of a linear, double-stranded DNA molecule with a 55-kDa protein covalently attached at either 5′ terminus. When this virus replicates in permissive cells, the replicated genome is not methylated (17Günthert U. Schweiger M. Stupp M. Doerfler W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 3923-3927Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 18Wienhues U. Doerfler W. J. Virol. 1985; 56: 320-324Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, when the virus DNA integrates into the host genome, as in Ad-induced tumor cells or in Ad-transformed cells, the viral genome becomes methylated by a de novo mechanism (19Sutter D.

Virol. 1995; 69: 1226-1242Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Frequently, multiple copies of Ad DNA are integrated at many sites in nontandem arrays in the host genome, but there seems to be a preference for sites with patchy homologies at the junctions between cellular and viral DNA (15Doerfler W. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1993; 46: 1-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 16Doerfler W. BBA Rev.

When adenovirus (foreign) DNA is inserted into the mammalian genome, there are changes in the methylation patterns of the flanking sequences due to the position of the integration and/or the inserted DNA sequences. After Ad integration, the methylation in the flanking host sequences can be altered (24Lichtenberg U. Zock C. Doerfler W. Virus Res. 1988; 11: 335-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) as well as other more remote genomic sequences such as major histocompatibility complex class I, Ig Cμ and intracisternal A particle DNA sequences (25Heller H. Kämmer C. Wilgenbus P. Doerfler W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5515-5519Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). In addition, when only bacteriophage λ DNA has been stably integrated into cellular DNA, again intracisternal A particle DNA sequences have shown changes in their methylation patterns (26Remus R. Kämmer C. Heller H. Schmitz B. Schell G. Doerfler W. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 1010-1022Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Methylation of Ad or any other foreign DNA integration may be affected by the site of integration in the host genome. In addition, position effects on de novo methylation have been shown in several different systems including cell lines containing a variety of transgenes (27Jähner D. Jaenisch R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 2212-2220Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 28Guy L.-G. Kothary R. Wall L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 4400-4407Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) and in transgenic mouse models (29Sasaki H. Allen N.D. Surani M.A. Jost J.-P. Saluz H.P. DNA Methylation: Molecular Biology and Biological Significance. Birkhäuser Verlag, Basel1993: 469-486Crossref Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 30Koetsier P.A. Mangel L. Schmitz B. Doerfler W. Transgen. Res. 1996; 4: 235-244Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Detailed analyses of DNA methylation and expression always reveal a more complex situation, because transgenic cell lines usually contain multiple copies of the gene of interest at different positions or in concatenated forms in the host genome, which is a common result of random integration. In order to understand better the regulation of de novo methylation, homologous recombination was used to insert different foreign DNAs into one site in the genome of mouse embryonic stem cells. The results show that random integration appears to promote de novo methylation. For homologous recombination with one allele of the same insert in the same cell type, the original methylation pattern for the genomic sequence is reestablished. However, for foreign DNA the extent of de novo methylation depends on the newly integrated sequence. AdBLK and SVBLK (Fig. 1) were constructed to perform homologous recombination in mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells within the B lymphocyte tyrosine kinase (BLK) gene located on mouse chromosome 14 (31Kozak C.A. Dymecki S.M. Niederhuber J.E. Desiderio S.V. Genomics. 1991; 9: 762-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). The two constructs contain from the 5′-end, a 4.1-kb BLK left genomic fragment from the Hin dIII site in intron 1′ to the Bam HI site in intron 3, the phosphoglycerate kinase (Pgk-1; Ref. 32Boer P.H. Potten H. Adra C.N. Jardine K. Mullhofer G. McBurney M.W. Biochem. Genet. 1990; 28: 299-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) promoter upstream of the neomycin gene, a viral promoter upstream of the luciferase gene, and a 3.3-kb BLK genomic fragment from the Bam HI site in intron 3 to the Eco RV site in exon 6 (Fig. 1). In addition, the thymidine kinase gene with the HSV-1 promoter was also present within the plasmids, but upon homologous recombination and selection with gancyclovir it would not be integrated. The BLK 5′- and 3′-genomic fragments were a gift of Gemma Texido and Alexander Tarakhovsky (University of Cologne, Germany). The numbering of the BLK exons is according to published data (33Dymecki S.M. Zwollo P. Zeller K. Kuhajda F.P. Desiderio S.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4815-4823Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The neomycin gene with the Pgk-1 promoter was derived from a published source (34McBurney M.W. Sutherland L.C. Adra C.N. Leclair B. Rudnicki M.A. Jardine K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 5755-5761Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). The luciferase gene was cloned from the PGL2 control vector (Promega). The only difference between these two plasmids, AdBLK and SVBLK, is in the luciferase promoter region (Fig. 1 A). The AdBLK construct contains Adluc with the adenovirus type 2 (Ad2) E2A late promoter upstream of the luciferase gene (35Muiznieks I. Doerfler W. FEBS Lett. 1994; 344: 251-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The SVBLK contains SVluc with both the SV40 early promoter 5′ of the gene and the SV40 enhancer at the 3′-end derived from the PGL2 control vector (Promega). This enhancer contains both the 72- and 21-bp repeats. A third plasmid, SVpBLK, has been constructed that contains SVluc without the SV40 enhancer sequences at the 3′-end. An additional BLK fragment, called BLK-out, was used to determine which clones contained homologously recombined DNA within the BLK gene (provided by Gemma Texido and Alexander Tarakhovsky), since this part of BLK was not present in any of the constructs used for transfection into ES cells. The BLK-5′ab probe is the fragment between the Apa I site in exon 2 and the Bam HI site in intron 3, while the BLK-3′xb probe is the DNA fragment from the same Bam HI site to the Xba I in intron 4. The Adluc probe is the Xho I to Sal I DNA fragment (3201 bp) of pAd2E2AL-LUX (35Muiznieks I. Doerfler W. FEBS Lett. 1994; 344: 251-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), and the same fragment was isolated from PGL2-control (Promega) to obtain the SVluc probe (3160 bp) (Fig.1 B). The neomycin (neo) probe is the 614-bp DNA fragment from Bsm I to Dde I, which contains only the neomycin sequence. The embryonic stem cell clone BL/6-III from the C57BL/6 inbred mouse strain (36Ledermann B. Bürki K. Exp. Cell Res. 1991; 197: 254-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) and the clones derived from this parental clone were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with Glutimax (Life Technologies, Inc.), 15% fetal calf serum, 1 mm sodium pyruvate (Life Technologies), 1× non essential amino acids (Life Technologies), 0.1 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, and conditioned medium containing leukemia inhibitory factor (provided by the laboratory of Klaus Rajewsky, University of Cologne, Germany). In some experiments, penicillin and streptomycin were added. A modified solution was used to wash the cells, MT-PBS (4 mmNaH2PO4·H2O, 16 mmNa2HPO4·2H2O, 150 mmNaCl) (37Torres R.M. Kühn R. Laboratory Protocols for Conditional Gene Targeting. Oxford University Press, Oxford1997: 73-79Google Scholar). Cells were propagated on tissue culture plastic dishes or flasks at 37 °C, 7.5% CO2, with 85–90% humidity. Medium was replaced every day, and the cells were passaged every 2–3 days to minimize differentiation of the cells (36Ledermann B. Bürki K. Exp. Cell Res. 1991; 197: 254-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). All plasmids used for transfection experiments were propagated in Escherichia coli strain XL1-Blue MRF′ (McrA−, McrCB−, McrF−, Mrr−, HsdR−), a derivative of XL1-Blue (Stratagene). Amounts of 30 μg each of linearized plasmid DNA were electroporated into 1–2 × 107 ES cells by using the Bio-Rad Gene Pulser apparatus as described previously (38Liljeström P. Lusa S. Huylebroeck D. Garoff H. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 4107-4113Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Medium was replaced daily. After 2 days, 300 μg/ml Geneticin (G418-sulfate; Life Technologies), and 2 days later, 2 × 10−6m gancyclovir (Syntex/Roche) was added to the mediun to minimize the number of clones with random integration events (39Mansour S. Thomas K. Capecchi M. Nature. 1988; 366: 348-352Crossref Scopus (1328) Google Scholar). Individual clones were isolated from day 10 to 12, transferred into 48-well plates, and transferred several days later to 24-well plates. After passaging the clones into larger dishes, no further selection (G418 or gancyclovir) was used. ES clone names begin with an A when they were derived from transfection experiments using the construct containing Adluc. Those clone names that begin with an S were derived from the plasmid containing SVluc. ES clone names had an additional “o” when they were isolated from plates having media with only Geneticin. The first passage without selection is referred to as passage 1 (p1). Each clone analyzed was passaged either into T75 or T175 flasks to isolate DNA for Southern blot analyses by standard procedures. The DNA samples were resuspended in TE (10 mmTris, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0), and 10 μg of each sample was used to identify the clones that contained homologously recombined (HR) or randomly integrated (RI) foreign DNA (Table I). For this analysis, the DNA was cleaved with Hin dIII (5 units/μg DNA) for 6 h at 37 °C. The fragments were separated by electrophoresis on a 0.8% agarose gel in 1 × TAE (40 mm Tris acetate, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0) for about 15 h at 30–40 V. The gel was stained with ethidium bromide (1 μg/ml) for 10 min, destained in water, and then prepared for Southern transfer (40Southern E.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1975; 98: 503-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (21490) Google Scholar, 41Koetsier P.A. Schorr J. Doerfler W. BioTechniques. 1993; 15: 260-261PubMed Google Scholar). Nylon Plus membranes (Qiagen) were used for the downward transfer. The membranes were then exposed to x-ray film for 1–5 days.Table ISurvey of all transgenic ES clones used in this studyIntegrated A (Adluc) clones1-aES clones with homologously recombined DNA chosen for further analyses.

Open table in a new tab Within the BLK flanking sequences and the luciferase and neomycin regions, methylation levels were determined by cleaving 30 μg of each DNA sample first with Bam HI (10 units/μg DNA) for 5 h followed by either Hpa II or Msp I (10 units/μg) overnight. Both Hpa II and Msp I cleaved DNA at 5′-CCGG-3′ sites. Hpa II is methylation-sensitive and therefore cannot cleave this site when the internal (3′) C is methylated. When the samples were cleaved with Bam HI only, 10 μg of genomic DNA was used. Some of the membranes were also exposed to the BAS-IIIS or BASMP phosphor image screen (Fuji), processed in the phosphor imager FUJIX BAS 1000 (Fuji), and analyzed with IPgel 1 software (Signal Analytics). Protein was extracted from the ES cell clones by standard protocols (Promega). Briefly, cells were washed twice with MT-PBS, scraped with a rubber policeman with MT-PBS, and transferred to an Eppendorf tube. The cells were washed and then resuspended in 1× lysis buffer (25 mm Tris-phosphate, pH 7.8, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100). All samples were frozen once, centrifuged, and then assayed three times each with the luminometer Lumat LB 9501 (Berthold, Bad Wildbad, Germany) using the luciferase substrate and buffer system (Promega). In addition, protein concentrations were determined (42Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217508) Google Scholar) for each sample to normalize the data to relative light units (RLU) per μg of protein. Two different DNAs, AdBLK or SVBLK, were electroporated into mouse ES cells to obtain homologous recombinants and to investigate whether specific DNA sequences can affect de novo methylation. ES cells were chosen as the host, since they possess a de novo methylation mechanism (43Jaenisch R. Harbers K. Jähner D. Stewart C. Stuhlmann H. J. Cell. Biochem. 1982; 20: 331-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 44Szyf M. Tanigawa G. McCarthy Jr., P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 4396-4400Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 45Lei H. Oh S.P. Okano M. Jüttermann R. Goss K.A. Jaenisch R. Li E. Development. 1996; 122: 3195-3205Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The BLK gene was chosen as the target, and both the genomic BLK DNA fragments and the ES cells (BL/6-III) are derived from the same mouse strain, C57BL/6. The plasmids, AdBLK and SVBLK, contain the neomycin and luciferase genes and are flanked by two BLK genomic DNA fragments. Therefore, after HR, the foreign DNA segment is inserted within intron 3 of the BLK gene (Fig. 1 B). Two types of HR clones were obtained after electroporation into ES clones, and they differ only within the luciferase region. The A clones carry Adluc, the Ad2 E2A late promoter 5′ of the luciferase reporter gene (Fig. 1 A, Table I, left side). This promoter has been shown to be inhibited by sequence-specific methylation (46Langner K.D. Vardimon L. Renz D. Doerfler W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 2950-2954Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 47Weisshaar B. Langner K.-D. Jüttermann R. Müller U. Zock C. Klimkait T. Doerfler W. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 202: 255-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The S clones have SVluc with the SV40 early promoter 5′ of the luciferase coding sequence and at the 3′-end the SV40 enhancer element containing the 72- and 21-bp repeats (Fig. 1 A, Table I, right side). Genomic DNA was obtained from about 40 different ES clones from each transfection to determine which clones had incorporated the neomycin and luciferase sequences within the expected BLK site by homologous recombination and which clones contained part or all of these sequences in other locations due to random integration events. The genomic DNA was cleaved with Hin dIII, and the fragments were separated by electrophoresis on a 0.8% agarose gel for Southern blot analysis. Two different probes were used to analyze the location of the inserts and the presence of the luciferase sequence (Fig.2). In Fig. 2 A, the DNA on the membrane was probed with the Eco RV–Hin dIII fragment of BLK, designated BLK-out, since this BLK sequence was outside the region used for homologous recombination (Fig.1 B). For the Adluc-containing clones (e.g. A1) and for the SVluc-containing clones (e.g. S4), the expected 8.5-kb fragment for the endogenous allele is detected as well as the 7.9-kb fragment for the homologous recombinant allele. Using the luciferase sequence probes (Fig. 1 B, Adluc or SVluc), the expected size fragment of 7.9 kb is also detected and is the same size as that present with the BLK-out probe (Fig. 1 B), since these fragments contain both the BLK and the luciferase sequences. When the DNA on the same membrane is probed with left and right BLK fragments, all BLK fragments are present as expected, the endogenous allele (8.5 kb) and the two fragments from the HR allele (5.9 and 7.9 kb). In addition to the clones that contain foreign DNA homologously recombined within intron 3, a number of ES clones with randomly integrated foreign DNA have been isolated. All RI clones are designated with an asterisk. No 7.9-kb band is detected in the DNA of these clones when BLK-out is used as the probe. In addition, an off size DNA fragment is visible when the DNA on the membrane is hybridized with the luciferase probe. Table I lists the Adluc-containing clones, referred to as A clones, and the SVluc-containing clones, referred to as S clones, which have been chosen for further studies. At the time points indicated, genomic DNA was extracted for Southern blot analyses, and in addition, protein extracts were prepared at different times to determine the luciferase activity in the different cell populations at various passages. In this study, we have analyzed a number of different ES clones to ascertain representative sampling. For the protein extracts of all HR A and S clones, the RLU/μg of protein decrease with initial passaging as seen in Fig. 3. Throughout passaging, the S clones exhibit 10–50-fold higher RLU/μg of protein than the A clones (Fig. 3, compare A and B). In addition, the constitutive RLU/μg of protein in later passages is higher for the S clones than for the A clones. Both sets of A* and S* clones with RI foreign DNA exhibit a 100-fold reduction or no luciferase activity at all from early on (passage 3) to the latest passage analyzed (passage 31; data not shown). After an initial drop in luciferase expression, both the A and S clones maintain a constitutive level even to late passages. We have not related these expression levels to the patterns of DNA methylation, because correlations between promoter activity and DNA methylation have not been the primary objective of this study. Moreover, in the SV40 promoter there is no Hpa II site that would allow investigations by restriction with Hpa II and Msp I. For the analyses of methylation patterns, all genomic DNA samples were cleaved with Bam HI to separate the BLK sequence from that of the foreign DNA (Fig.1 B). In this way, each DNA sequence was analyzed individually. In addition, one of the two restriction endonuclease isoschizomers Msp I or Hpa II was used to analyze the DNA methylation levels. Unlike Msp I, Hpa II is unable to cleave the sequence 5′-CCGG-3′ when the internal (3′) C is methylated. Therefore, the difference in DNA fragment patterns generated with these two endonucleases represents differences in DNA methylation at 5′-CCGG-3′ sites. When control genomic DNA (C in Fig. 4) from untransfected cells is cleaved with Bam HI (lanes B), a single fragment is detected as expected when BLK-3′xb was used as a probe (Fig. 4, C, lanes B). Msp I cuts the DNA into much smaller fragments (lanes M) which are not resolved by electrophoresis on a 0.8% agarose gel. There are larger molecular mass fragments present after Bam HI/Hpa II cleavage (Fig. 4, lanes H) as compared with Bam HI/Msp I cleavage (lanes M). This finding demonstrates that many Hpa II sites within the BLK 3′-flanking sequence (see Fig. 1 B) are methylated. A comparison of the control (C) DNAs to the DNAs from A and S clones reveals that the Hpa II patterns are very similar or identical (Fig. 4, H lanes). Moreover, for a given DNA fragment within an H lane of any of the ES clones, the relative intensities are similar as for the corresponding bands in the control DNA H lane (Fig. 4, e.g. C and A17 or S11; H lanes). This similarity of Hpa II patterns within the BLK 3′-flanking sequence has been seen for all A and S clones analyzed. With a few exceptions, similar results have also been obtained for the 5′-flanking BLK sequence (data not shown). First, as in the BLK 3′-flanking sequence for the control (C) DNA from untransfected ES cells, there are many larger molecular mass fragments present in the H lanes as compared with the M lanes. This finding again implies that the BLK 5′-flanking sequences are methylated. The Hpa II patterns of DNA from one clone, S4, show some differences in banding patterns of the 5′-flanking sequence, both between passages (p6 to p20) and compared with DNA from the parental untransfected ES cells (data not shown). Slight differences in the Hpa II patterns may not be detectable, since the 5′- and 3′-BLK probes hybridize to both the endogenous and HR allelic fragments. We conclude that the homologously reintegrated BLK sequences are remethylated in 5′-CCGG-3′ patterns very similarly to those of the endogenous BLK gene. The luciferase regions of the A and S clones were analyzed to investigate whether foreign DNA sequences influence de novo methylation after their integration. Fig.5 shows the autoradiograms of Southern blots of genomic DNA isolated at different passages for a number of the A clones. The entire luciferase region including the Ad promoter was used as the probe (Adluc; Fig. 1 A). As expected, there is no detectable hybridization to the DNA in the control lane (C, lanes B, M, and H). However, for the DNAs from the A clones, the expected 5-kb fragment is detected after Bam HI cleavage (B lanes). There are 15 5′-CCGG-3′ sites (vertical lines in Fig. 1 A) that can be differentially methylated. Different cleavage patterns are generated by Msp I versus Hpa II (M and H lanes, respectively). Upon Hpa II cleavage of the DNA from all passages analyzed, very large Hpa II fragments, ranging in size up to the 5-kb Bam HI fragment in the DNA of many clones (e.g. A4, A5, A8, A16, and A18) are generated (Fig. 5). For the S clones, a very different trend is seen. SVluc (Fig.1 A) was used as a probe to determine the methylat"

The protein phosphatases can be divided into two large families: the Ser/Thr phosphatases, which are metalloproteins, and the protein-tyrosine phosphatases family (here referred as Cys(X)5Arg), which proceeds via a thiol-phosphate enzyme intermediate (1Barford D. Das A.K. Egloff M.P Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1998; 27: 133-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar). The Cys(X)5Arg family includes: 1) tyrosine specific phosphatases (PTP); 2) VH1-like dual specificity phosphatases; 3) CDC25 phosphatases, which regulate the cell cycle; and 4) the low molecular weight phosphatases (1Barford D. Das A.K. Egloff M.P Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1998; 27: 133-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar,2Fauman E.B. Saper M.A. Trends Biochem.

Nature. 1991; 350: 359-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar) and upon expression in Escherichia coli, VH1 was shown to dephosphorylate phosphotyrosine as well as phosphoserine and phosphothreonine containing substrates. Several members of this growing family of dual-specificity tyrosine phosphatases have been identified in mammals and yeast (1Barford D. Das A.K. Egloff M.P Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1998; 27: 133-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar, 2Fauman E.B. Saper M.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 413-417Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). Among the yeast VH1-like phosphatases, MSG5 (4Doi K. Gartner A. Ammerer G. Errede B. Shinkawa H. Sugimoto K. Matsumoto K. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 61-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar) and Pmp1 (5Sugiura R. Toda T. Shuntoh H. Yanagida M. Kuno T. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 140-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) have been shown to regulate the phosphorylation state of specific mitogen-activated protein kinases, FUS3 and Pmk1, respectively. The Saccharomyces cerevisiae dual specificity phosphatase YVH1 is of particular interest because inactivation of the YVH1 gene results in a striking increase in the yeast doubling time (6Guan K.-L. Hakes D.J. Wang Y. Park H.-D. Cooper T.G. Dixon J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 89: 12175-12179Crossref Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Moreover, YVH1 has also been suggested to play a role in controlling meiosis and sporulation (7Park H.-D. Besser A.E. Clancy M.J. Cooper T.G. Yeast. 1996; 12: 1135-1151Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Analysis of the S. cerevisiae genome suggests that there are 17 open reading frames corresponding to PTPs and dual specific phosphatases. 1M. Muda, M. Wishart, B. Ernsting & J. E. Dixon, unpublished observation. 1M. Muda, M. Wishart, B. Ernsting & J. E. Dixon, unpublished observation. The number of mammalian phosphatases currently identified in the human genome appears to be greater than 200 and is likely to increase as more sequence information is deposited in the data bases. Yeast Cys(X)5Arg phosphatases that have clearly defined mammalian orthologues are particularly interesting, because they are likely to function as regulators of important cellular functions that have been conserved over an extensive evolutionary period. This report identifies the human orthologue of yeast YVH1, named hYVH1, and demonstrates that the human protein can complement the yeast slow growth phenotype. The noncatalytic COOH terminus of hYVH1 is essential for the complementation of the yeast yvh1Δ phenotype. The COOH terminus of hYVH1 encodes a novel domain, which binds 2 mol of zinc/mol of protein. This is the first example of a phosphatase that harbors a novel zinc finger regulating motif. Although the exact function of hYVH1 is unknown, it maps to chromosome 1q21-q22, a region that is amplified in human liposarcomas (8Forus A. Weghuis D.O. Smeets D. Fostad Ø. Myklebost O. van Kessel A.G. Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 1995; 4: 8-14Crossref Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 9Forus A. Berner J.-M. Meza-Zepeda L.A. Saeter G. Mischke D. Fodstad Ø. Myklebost O. Br. J.

S. cerevisiae haploid strains used in this study, MMY22 (MAT a, his3, leu2, trp1, ura3, yvh1Δ::G418) and MMY21 (MATα, his3, leu2, trp1, ura3, YVH1) were derived from GYC86 (MAT a /α, his3/his3, leu2/leu2, trp1/trp1, ura3/ura3, YVH1/YVH1) (6Guan K.-L. Hakes D.J. Wang Y. Park H.-D. Cooper T.G. Dixon J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 89: 12175-12179Crossref Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The haploid MMY22 strain carrying the null mutation yvh1Δ::G418, was obtained following PCR2-based gene disruption (10Guldener U. Heck S. Fiedler T. Beinhauer J. Hegemann J.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 2519-2524Crossref PubMed Scopus (1344) Google Scholar). This null mutation removes the entire coding sequence of YVH1 within the S. cerevisiae genome. G418-resistant colonies, obtained from GYC 86 using the above procedure, were screened by PCR to identify yvh1Δ::G418/YVH1 transformants. Segregants were selected from tetrads with a 2 G418-resistant: 2 G418-sensitive segregation pattern. Strain MMY21 and MMY22 were derived from the same tetrad. Human sequences similar to the S. cerevisiae YVH1 protein were identified by BLAST searches of the human expressed sequence tag data base. A cDNA clone corresponding to EST188030 was obtained from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA) and completely sequenced on both strands. For mammalian expression, the hYVH1 open reading frame was amplified by PCR using primers containing Hin dIII and Bam HI restriction sites and cloned into the corresponding sites in pEGFP (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA). For bacterial expression, the hYVH1 open reading frame was subcloned into pGEX4T1 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) to generate pGEX/hYVH1, pGEX/hYVH1CS, pGEX/hYVH1ΔC, pGEX/hYVH1CSΔC as follows. PCR primers containing Eco RI and Pst I restriction sites were used to subclone the ∼1-kilobase PCR product into the corresponding sites of pBSK (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The plasmid obtained was cut with Eco RI and Not I, and the fragment containing hYVH1 was subcloned into the corresponding sites of pGEX4T1. hYVH1ΔC was obtained by PCR using a specific primer that introduces a stop codon at amino acid 191. To generate an enzymatically inactive hYVVH1 and hYVH1CSΔC the catalytic essential Cys115 was mutated to a serine residue. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the Quick-Change Kit (Stratagene) according to manufacturer's instructions. The hYVH1, hYVH1CS, hYVH1ΔC, hYVH1CSΔC inserts were isolated from pGEX4T1 using Bam HI and Xma I and subcloned into p416ADH (11Mumberg D. Müller R. Funk M. Gene. 1995; 156: 119-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (1576) Google Scholar). The Xba I fragment encoding YVH1, from pGE-KG/YVH1 was used to generate p416ADH/YVH1. All PCR-generated constructs were verified by sequence analysis. PGEX/hYVH1 wild type and mutated versions were transformed into E. coli BLR (Novagen, Madison, WI). Cells were grown in 2× YT medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin. Following induction with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside cells were harvested, resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% (w/v) Triton X-100, 5 mm dithiothreitol, supplemented with complete EDTA-free protease inhibitor tablets (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), and proteins were purified as described previously (12Muda M. Boschert U. Smith A. Antonsson B. Gillieron C. Chabert C. Camps M. Martinou I. Ashworth A. Arkinstall S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5141-5151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Following elution from glutathione-agarose beads, protein samples were concentrated using Centriprep 30 Concentrators (Amicon, Inc., Beverly, MA) buffer exchanged to storage buffer, 5 mmdithiothreitol, 100 mm NaCl in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, and stored at 4 °C. The purity of all proteins in this study was ∼ 80–90%, as judged by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis. Protein concentrations were determined by amino acid analysis at the University of Michigan Protein Core Facility. Inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP) was used to determine the metal species bound to the purified protein. ICP of GST/hYVH1, GST/hYVH1CS, GST/hYVH1ΔC, GST/hYVH1CSΔC was performed by Ted J. Huston, Department of Geological Sciences, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. GST/hYVH1 wild type and mutants fusion proteins were assayed for intrinsic phosphatase activity. Briefly, GST fusion proteins were incubated at 37 °C for 10 min in a reaction volume of 500 μl containing 0.1 mm3-O-methylfluorescein phosphate, or 20 mm p-nitrophenyl phosphate, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 5 mm dithiothreitol. Reactions were monitored by measuring hydrolysis at 477 or 410 nm for 3-O-methylfluorescein phosphate and p-nitrophenyl phosphate, respectively, as described previously (13Gottlin E.B. Xu X.

Purified GST/hYVH1 (above) was used to immunize two rabbits (Cocalico Biologicals, Inc., Reamstown, PA). Polyclonal antibodies were prepared and purified by pre-absorption on GST-coupled Affi-Gel-15 (Bio-Rad) followed by absorption on GST/hYVH1-coupled Affi-Gel-15. Elution and storage of antibodies was as described (14Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies : A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar). A sequence tagged site with forward primer AGCTTGGGAAGAAACTTGC and a reverse primer GATCAAAAGGCTTTGATTGC encoding a 162-base pair region of the untranslated sequence of the hYVHI were used to screen the Standford G3 Radiation Hybrid Panel (Research Genetics, Inc. Huntsville, AL) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Our raw data was submitted to the Stanford Radiation Hybrid Mapping section, and the results obtained from their two point maximum likelihood analysis identified that our hYVH1 sequence tagged site was linked within 0.1 cR10000 of marker WI-7155 (Lod > 6) on chromosome 1. The marker WI-7155 maps to 1q21–22, 170–179.2 centimorgan. Subsequent to our analysis, ESTN30837encoding a partial sequence for the hYVH1 gene was identified and mapped to this region. The hYVH1 gene, the WI-7155 marker, and the ApoA2 gene map to a 9cM interval bordered by the sequence-tagged site markers D1S2635 and D1S2844. Within this region the ApoA2 gene has been shown to be amplified in liposarcomas (8Forus A. Weghuis D.O. Smeets D. Fostad Ø. Myklebost O. van Kessel A.G. Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 1995; 4: 8-14Crossref Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 9Forus A. Berner J.-M. Meza-Zepeda L.A. Saeter G. Mischke D. Fodstad Ø. Myklebost O. Br. J. Cancer. 1998; 78: 495-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). COS-7 and HeLa cells were grown under 5% CO2in Dulbecco's modified Eagles's medium containing 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum. Subcellular localization of recombinant hYVH1 was determined in transfected COS-7 cells. HeLa cells were used for detection of endogenous hYVH1. COS-7 cells were transfected directly on glass slides using the pEGFP/hYVH1 construct. Following transfection, cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde. Immunofluorescence detection of endogenous hYVH1 in HeLa cells was performed using affinity-purified polyclonal antibodies (above) with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit second antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc., West Grove, PA). HeLa cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and then permeabilized using 0.2% Triton X-100. Antibodies were in 5% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline; incubation and washing were as described (14Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies : A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar). For immunodetection of hYVH1 expression in yeast, cells were grown to an A600 of 1 in synthetic medium-uracil, lysed as described (15Ooi C.E. Rabinovich E. Dancis A. Bonifacino J.S. Klauser R.D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3515-3523Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar), and total proteins from cells corresponding to an A600 of 0.05 were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Immunoblot analysis was performed with polyclonal anti-hYVH1 serum (1:3,000 dilution), followed by incubation with anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Bio-Rad) and then detected by chemiluminescence. To identify the human protein sequences that were similar to the S. cerevisiae YVH1, a BLAST computer search of the expressed sequence tag data base was performed. Several human sequences were found that had fragment similarity to YVH1. One clone corresponding to EST188030 contained an insert of 1,271-base pairs; nucleotide sequence analysis revealed a putative start codon followed by an open reading frame of 1,021 and 228-base pairs of 3′-untranslated sequence with an uncommon poly(A) signal, ATTAAA, preceding the 3′ poly(A) tail. Using a probe encompassing the first 998 nucleotides of the cDNA, a major RNA of 1.4 kilobases was detected in most of the tissues analyzed, the strongest signals were present in spleen, testis, ovary, and peripheral blood leukocytes (data not shown). In lung and liver, the 1.4-kilobase band was only detectable following long exposure times. The size of this band is in agreement with the observed size of the cDNA clone. The open reading frame encodes a protein of 340 amino acids, and comparison of the human and yeast sequences revealed an overall identity of 31%. Western blot analysis using hYVH1 antisera demonstrated that a protein of approximately 38,000 Da, consistent with the predicted mass of the protein (37,687 Da), was expressed in a variety of cells lines (data not shown). The subcellular localization of hYVH1 was determined both by overexpressing hYVH1 fused to the green fluorescent protein (GFP) in COS-7 cells and indirect immunofluorescence detection of the endogenous protein in a HeLa cell line. The endogenous as well as the recombinant hYVH1 proteins localized predominantly to the nuclei (Fig.1, A and B) but were also detected in the cytosol in a mesh-like pattern. The 3′-untranslated sequence of hYVH1 was used to design a sequence tagged site to probe the Stanford G3 Radiation Hybrid Panel. The hYVH1 gene localized to chromosome 1q21–22, which interestingly maps to a region of the genome that is amplified in liposarcomas (8Forus A. Weghuis D.O. Smeets D. Fostad Ø. Myklebost O. van Kessel A.G. Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 1995; 4: 8-14Crossref Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 9Forus A. Berner J.-M. Meza-Zepeda L.A. Saeter G. Mischke D. Fodstad Ø. Myklebost O. Br. J. Cancer. 1998; 78: 495-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). It is tempting to speculate that amplification of hYVH1 in liposarcomas could lead to a positive effect on cell growth, and this is consistent with the growth defect observed in the yeast null mutant. Using the deduced hYVH1 protein sequence the GenBank™/EMBL Data Bank was analyzed and a Schizosaccharomyces pombe YVH1 protein (accession no. 2257526) was also identified. Fig.2 A shows that the three proteins share an N-terminal phosphatase domain within the first 200 amino acids, followed by a COOH-terminal domain of approximately 100 amino acids, which shows a striking degree of amino acid sequence identity. Fig. 2 A shows that the human, S. cerevisiae, and S. pombe COOH-terminal domains contain seven invariant cysteines and one histidine reminiscent of sequences observed in the RING (16Bordern K.L.B. Freemont P.S. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1996; 6: 395-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar), LAP/PHD (17Saha V. Chaplin T. Gregorini A. Ayton P. Young B.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9737-9741Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 18Mullersman J.E. Pfeffer L.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 56-59Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), and LIM motifs (19Dawid I.B. Breen J.J. Toyama R. Trends Genet. 1998; 14: 156-162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar). Although the RING, LAP/PHD, and LIM motifs each contain seven cysteine residues and a single histidine, the spacing of the conserved residues in the COOH terminus of YVH1 is unique. An analysis of this unique pattern and spacing of the seven cysteine and one histidine residues revealed that uncharacterized YVH1 phosphatases were also present in the Caenorhabditis elegans genome (accession no. 3642004) as well as in Plasmodium falciparum genome (accession no. 3649770) (Fig. 2 B). Moreover, one uncharacterized protein from Arabidopsis thaliana (accession no. 2832664) was found to contain this novel cysteine-rich motif. Interestingly, its primary sequence suggests it is not a phosphatase. The unique spacing of seven cysteine residues and a single histidine in the COOH-terminal domain is reminiscent of finger domains, which are known to bind zinc. For this reason, hYVH1 was examined for its ability to bind metal ions. Analysis of the metal content of the recombinant full-length GST/hYVH1 and a truncated GST/hYVH1ΔC (amino acids 1–191) was carried out using ICP (Table I). ICP analysis revealed that hYVH1 contains stoichiometric amounts of zinc, 2 equivalents of zinc/mol of protein. Moreover, zinc binding was highly specific as no other metal was detected in significant amounts. The COOH-terminal deletion mutant, hYVH1ΔC contained no zinc or other metals, demonstrating that the carboxyl-terminal region of the protein was required for zinc binding. Substitution of the active-site cysteine to serine, hYVH1CS, had no effect on zinc binding (Table I). To further analyze the contribution of the invariant cysteine residues present within the COOH-terminal domain, we generated three site-directed mutants, substituting pairs of the conserved cysteine residues with serine residues (hYVH1C221, 224/S, hYVH1C29, 293/S and hYVH1C308, 310/S). Unfortunately all these cysteine mutants were refractory to glutathione affinity purification preventing further characterization. This observation suggests that the conserved cysteines in the COOH-terminal zinc binding domain are necessary to generate a properly folded protein.Table IMetal content (mol of metal/mol of proteins) of wild type and mutant hYVH1 GST fusion proteins determined by ICP analysisMetal ionhYVH1hYVH1CShYVH1ΔChYVH1CSΔCZinc2.1 ± 0.22.4 ± 0.20.01610.0122Magnesium0.0410.0170.0260.018Manganese<0.01<0.01<0.01<0.01Iron0.100.0970.014<0.01Cobalt<0.01<0.01<0.01<0.01Nickel<0.01<0.01<0.01<0.01Copper<0.010.014<0.01<0.01Data are the average of triplicate determination from two independent protein preparations, with the exception of magnesium and nickel, which were determined from one preparation. Open table in a new tab Data are the average of triplicate determination from two independent protein preparations, with the exception of magnesium and nickel, which were determined from one preparation. The importance of the COOH-terminal domain in regulating enzymatic activity was analyzed in vitro by comparing the phosphatase activity of full-length and truncated recombinant GST fusion proteins. The initial rate of hydrolysis of the truncated and full-length forms of hYVH1 were determined with two artificial substrates, p-nitrophenyl phosphate and 3-O-methylfluorescein phosphate. At several different substrate concentrations, the initial rates for the full-length and catalytic domain of hYVH1 differed by less than a factor of two, suggesting that the COOH-terminal domain does not play a major role in the enzymatic activity of the YVH1-like phosphatases (data not shown). In contrast the COOH-terminal domain is essential for YVH1 function in vivo (see below). We disrupted the YVH1 gene in the diploid S. cerevisiae strain, GYC86, replacing the YVH1 coding region with a kanamycin cassette. Diploid strains in which one YVH1 copy was inactivated did not display any growth defect. However, consistent with our previous report, subsequent to sporulation, all of the haploid cells carrying the yvh1Δ allele displayed a strikingly slow growth phenotype (6Guan K.-L. Hakes D.J. Wang Y. Park H.-D. Cooper T.G. Dixon J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 89: 12175-12179Crossref Scopus (75) Google Scholar). We then tested the ability of an episomal copy of hYVH1 to complement this growth defect. Strains carrying the yvh1Δ allele were transformed with a centromeric yeast expression vector expressing the hYVH1 protein under the control of the ADH promoter. Following transformation, colonies were grown to saturation and serial dilutions were replica plated on SC-uracil or YPD plates. Colony size, indicative of growth rate, was scored by visual inspection following 2 days of incubation at 30 °C. Using this semi-quantitative analysis, we observed that the hYVH1 protein was able to restore the normal growth phenotype in the yvh1Δ strain, MMY22 (Fig.3 A). Complementation by hYVH1 was indistinguishable from yeast YVH1 protein expressed from the same vector (Fig. 3 A). Surprisingly, the catalytically inactive versions of hYVH1 and YVH1 proteins were also able to restore normal growth phenotype to strain carrying the yvh1Δ mutation (Fig. 3 A). One explanation of this phenomena is that both the human and yeast Cys-Ser mutant phosphatases act such that the mutated phosphatase complexes with the endogenous downstream target/effector blocking its activity (20Tonks N.K. Neel B. Cell. 1996; 87: 365-368Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar). Hence, this would be functionally equivalent to dephosphorylation/inactivation of the target/effector by the wild type enzyme. In contrast, expression of the truncated phosphatase (hYVH1ΔC) in S. cerevisiae disrupted strains did not restore the normal growth phenotype. Likewise, a catalytic inactive truncated protein, hYVH1CSΔC, was also unable to rescue the growth defect (Fig.3 A), suggesting that the COOH-terminal domain is required for YVH1 function in vivo. Importantly the lack of complementation was not due to differences in the protein expression levels, because Western blot analysis demonstrated that all proteins were expressed in comparable amounts (Fig. 3 B). Expression of the “double” point mutated proteins, hYVH1C221,224/S, hYVH1C290,293/S and hYVH1C308,310/S were unable to restore a normal growth rate. However, all these mutated forms, in contrast to the full-length and truncated versions, were extremely unstable when expressed in yeast and barely detectable by Western blot. Taken together, these results suggest that although the COOH-terminal domain is largely dispensable for the intrinsic enzymatic activity, its putative interaction with the endogenous target/effectors is essential for the in vivo function. Roles for the COOH-terminal domain include correct localization of the catalytic core within cellular compartments or, more directly, docking of the phosphatase domain to a target molecule. In summary, the human orthologue of the S. cerevisiae YVH1 protein-tyrosine phosphatase was identified and its function is beginning to be dissected. Remarkably, the COOH-terminal domain is dispensable for in vitro phosphatase activity but is essential for function in vivo. ICP analysis of purified hYVH1 proteins revealed that the COOH-terminal domain binds 2 mol of zinc/mol of protein, identifying it as a novel zinc finger domain. Because zinc finger domains (such as the RING finger and LIM domains) are broadly known for their role in mediating multiprotein complex assembly, it is tempting to speculate that the COOH-terminal domain of hYVH1 is involved in protein-protein interactions. Specific subcellular targeting by the noncatalytic portion of intracellular protein tyrosine phosphatases is a proposed mechanism for assuring enzymatic specificity (21Mauro L.J. Dixon J.E. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 151-155Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Recently, direct substrate binding of protein phosphatases via noncatalytic extensions, has been described as another means of restricting enzyme action within the cell (22Camps M. Nichols A. Gillieron C. Antonsson B. Muda M. Chabert C. Boschert U. Arkinstall S. Science. 1998; 280: 1262-1265Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). Results presented in this report suggest that the COOH-terminal domain may tether YVH1 protein phosphatases to their corresponding intracellular target/substrate, and this interaction is necessary for physiological function within the cell. We are currently investigating these possibilities and experiments are under way to identify the targets of the human and S. cerevisiae YVH1 proteins. We thank M. J.

https://openalex.org/W1967097744,"Chymotrypsin family serine proteases play essential roles in key biological and pathological processes and are frequently targets of drug discovery efforts. This large enzyme family is also among the most advanced model systems for detailed studies of enzyme mechanism and structure/function relationships. Productive interactions between these enzymes and their substrates are widely believed to mimic the ""canonical"" interactions between serine proteases and ""standard"" inhibitors observed in numerous protease-inhibitor complexes. To test this central hypothesis we have synthesized and characterized a series of peptide analogs, based on model substrates and inhibitors of trypsin, that contain unnatural main chains. These results call into question a long accepted theory regarding the interaction of chymotrypsin family serine proteases with substrates and suggest that the canonical interactions observed between these enzymes and standard inhibitors may represent nonproductive rather than productive, substrate-like interactions."
https://openalex.org/W2070495202,"The upstream coagulation enzymes are homologous trypsin-like serine proteases that typically function in enzyme-cofactor complexes, exemplified by coagulation factor VIIa (VIIa), which is allosterically activated upon binding to its cell surface receptor tissue factor (TF). TF cooperates with VIIa to create a bimolecular recognition surface that serves as an exosite for factor X binding. This study analyzes to what extent scissile bond docking to the catalytic cleft contributes to macromolecular substrate affinity. Mutation of the P1 Arg residue in factor X to Gln prevented activation by the TF·VIIa complex but did not reduce macromolecular substrate affinity for TF·VIIa. Similarly, mutations of the S and S′ subsites in the catalytic cleft of the enzyme VIIa failed to reduce affinity for factor X, although the affinity for small chromogenic substrates and the efficiency of factor X scissile bond cleavage were reduced. Thus, docking of the activation peptide bond to the catalytic cleft of this enzyme-cofactor complex does not significantly contribute to affinity for macromolecular substrate. Rather, it appears that the creation of an extended macromolecular substrate recognition surface involving enzyme and cofactor is utilized to generate substrate specificity between the highly homologous, regulatory proteases of the coagulation cascade.

The chymotrypsin-like subclass of the serine protease family is characterized by a conserved fold of the ∼240-residue protease domain, resulting in an optimal positioning of the catalytic triad Ser-195 and His-57 residues in an invariable position (residue positions are based on chymotrypsin numbering; for corresponding VIIa1 numbering, see Ref. 1Dickinson C.D. Kelly C.R. Ruf W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14379-14384Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). The most important determinant for serine protease specificity is the S1 specificity pocket that accommodates the P1 residue (residue 15 in chymotrypsin numbering) located amino-terminal to the scissile bond (2Schechter I. Berger A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1967; 27: 157-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (4697) Google Scholar). The charge and shape properties of this pocket determine the fit of the P1 side chain and the proper presentation of the peptide bond for nucleophilic attack by Ser-195. Certain subsets of this protease family are evolutionary closely related and constitute functionally cooperating enzyme systems, such as the coagulation cascade (3Davie E.W. Fujikawa K. Kisiel W. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 10363-10370Crossref PubMed Scopus (1609) Google Scholar). In the latter, the proteases share an acidic Asp-189 residue that forms the bottom of the S1 specificity pocket and thus are capable of cleaving very similar substrates that contain an Arg at the P1 position. Despite this identical P1 residue in all zymogen precursors of these enzymes, the coagulation proteases show remarkable macromolecular substrate specificity, allowing for a highly regulated consecutive activation of the individual zymogens in the cascade. Substrate specificity determinants of these enzymes thus likely involve structural characteristics other than the S1 pocket. A large number of studies, employing either small peptidyl substrate mimics or inhibitors that bind to the active site, have provided evidence that the catalytic clefts of the coagulation proteases have distinct features that prefer certain residues in more extended positions on both sites of the scissile bond (4Perona J.J.

Protein engineering has further been employed to demonstrate that determinants in the active site cleft are critical for substrate specificity of coagulation proteases (9Hopfner K.P. Brandstetter H.

However, modifications of small peptide substrates at the P2-P3 or at P′ subsite positions typically generate substrate selectivity that differs by less than 10-fold between coagulation enzymes (5Butenas S. Orfeo T. Lawson J.H. Mann K.G. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 5399-5411Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 8Cho K. Tanaka T. Cook R.R. Kisiel W. Fujikawa K. Kurachi K. Powers J.C.

Considering the similarity in sequence at the scissile bond of the coagulation serine protease zymogens, the observed changes in catalytic efficiency for small substrates cannot entirely explain the high degree of selectivity for macromolecular substrate. Macromolecular substrate activation by coagulation proteases depends on protein cofactor/receptors that localize these enzymes to cell surfaces. In the initiation phase of coagulation, tissue factor (TF), a transmembrane receptor structurally related to the cytokine receptor family, forms a high affinity complex with coagulation factor VIIa (VIIa) (13Ruf W. Edgington T.S. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 385-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). One result of TF·VIIa complex formation is allosteric activation of VIIa. VIIa makes an incomplete zymogen to enzyme transition after proteolytic cleavage, and TF binding to the VIIa protease domain likely activates catalytic function by ordering loop segments of the activation domain (14Ruf W. Dickinson C.D. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 1998; 8: 350-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). TF not only influences the catalytic cleft of VIIa but also directly interacts with macromolecular substrate. In particular, Lys residues 165 and 166, located in a membrane proximal position in the carboxyl-terminal module of TF, contribute to protein-protein interactions with the coagulation factor X (X) Gla domain (15Ruf W. Miles D.J. Rehemtulla A. Edgington T.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6375-6381Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Huang Q. Neuenschwander P.F. Rezaie A.R. Morrissey J.H. J. Biol.

The Gla domain of substrate docks into a larger collision surface constituted by the VIIa Gla domain (17Ruf W. Kalnik M.W. Lund-Hansen T. Edgington T.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15719-15725Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Ruf W. Shobe J. Rao S.M. Dickinson C.D. Olson A. Edgington T.S. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 1957-1966Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) in complex with the carboxyl-terminal module of TF (19Banner D.W. D'Arcy A. Chène C. Winkler F.K. Guha A. Konigsberg W.H. Nemerson Y. Kirchhofer D. Nature. 1996; 380: 41-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar). Monoclonal antibodies to TF (20Huang M. Syed R. Stura E.A. Stone M.J. Stefanko R.S. Ruf W. Edgington T.S. Wilson I.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 275: 873-894Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) and VIIa (21Dickinson C.D. Shobe J. Ruf W. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 277: 959-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) have provided further evidence for the location of exosites for macromolecular substrate recognition. Notably, these monoclonal antibodies acted as competitive inhibitors of macromolecular substrate binding, as evidenced by a pronounced effect on the Km for X activation (21Dickinson C.D. Shobe J. Ruf W. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 277: 959-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar,22Ruf W. Edgington T.S. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1991; 66: 529-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). These data are consistent with the hypothesis that proper presentation and activation of natural substrate are critically dependent on binding of the macromolecular substrate with exosite regions involving both cofactor and enzyme. Active site-inhibited thrombin has been shown to act as an efficient competitive inhibitor for macromolecular substrate activation by the prothrombinase complex, leading to the proposal that exosite docking is the major determinant for macromolecular substrate affinity (23Krishnaswamy S. Betz A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12080-12086Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Moreover, a proteolytic fragment of thrombin that corresponds to the carboxyl-terminal half of the protease domain contains the necessary structural elements for macromolecular substrate docking with the prothrombinase complex (24Betz A. Krishnaswamy S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10709-10718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Because this fragment contains most of the loop segments known as the “activation domain,” which are highly flexible prior to proteolytic zymogen activation or inhibitor modification (25Huber R. Bode W. Accounts Chem. Res. 1978; 11: 114-122Crossref Scopus (604) Google Scholar, 26Bode W. Schwager P. Huber R. J. Mol. Biol. 1978; 118: 99-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar), it remains to be established to what extent the active site blocked thrombin and derived fragments faithfully mimic the cofactor/enzyme docking mode of the zymogen-substrate protease domain. In order to investigate the role of scissile bond docking within the structural context of the intact zymogen, we mutated the P1 Arg residue in macromolecular substrate X. This mutation of the primary specificity determinant in substrate, as well as of recognition determinants in the catalytic cleft of VIIa that impair the interactions of the scissile bond with the active site of the enzyme, failed to reduce affinity for X, demonstrating that exosite docking is the only critical factor that governs macromolecular substrate affinity for TF·VIIa. By providing direct and independent experimental evidence, these data thus allow generalization of the hypothesis that specificity of the highly homologous, cofactor-dependent upstream coagulation serine proteases is achieved by macromolecular substrate recognition determinants of exosites, rather than sequence specificity of the catalytic cleft. Full-length recombinant human TF was produced from insect cells and reconstituted into 30% phosphatidylserine/70% phosphatidylcholine (TF/PCPS), or 100% phosphatidylcholine (TF/PC), as described (27Ruf W. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 11631-11636Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The soluble extracellular domain of TF, TF1–218, was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified and refolded from inclusion bodies, as described (28Stone M.J. Ruf W. Miles D.J. Edgington T.S. Wright P.E. Biochem. J. 1995; 310: 605-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). X was purified from plasma, followed by immunoaffinity chromatography on immobilized monoclonal antibody F21–4.2 to reduce contamination by VII (1Dickinson C.D. Kelly C.R. Ruf W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14379-14384Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Monoclonal antibody F3–3.2A to VII/VIIa was characterized previously (21Dickinson C.D. Shobe J. Ruf W. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 277: 959-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Recombinant wild-type and mutant VII were expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells and purified by sequential monoclonal antibody and ion exchange chromatography, as described (27Ruf W. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 11631-11636Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Because of slow zymogen to enzyme conversion VIIAla-40 and VIIAla-99 activation was accelerated by addition of factor IXa, as described (1Dickinson C.D. Kelly C.R. Ruf W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14379-14384Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Mutant and wild-type VIIa were active site blocked with d-Phe-l-Phe-Arg chloromethylketone (Calbiochem) to yield >98% modification, as determined by amidolytic assay (29Dickinson C.D. Ruf W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19875-19879Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Gla content of the mutants, determined by amino acid analysis of alkaline hydrolysates performed at Commonwealth Biotechnologies (Richmond, VA), showed a full complement of Gla residues indistinguishable from wild-type recombinant VIIa. Recombinant X production has previously been described in detail (18Ruf W. Shobe J. Rao S.M. Dickinson C.D. Olson A. Edgington T.S. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 1957-1966Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). All mutations were introduced into a cDNA clone with a propeptide mutation at position Thr-2 to Arg to facilitate cellular processing (30Hamamoto T. Yamamoto M. Nordfang O. Petersen J.G.L. Foster D.C. Kisiel W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8704-8710Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and mutations of Asn-181 and Asn-191 (residue numbering based on Ref. 31Messier T.L. Pittman D.D. Long G.L. Kaufman R.J. Church W.R. Gene. 1991; 99: 291-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) to Ala and Asp, respectively, to eliminate heterogeneity from glycosylation of the activation peptide. We had previously characterized this recombinant protein that is efficiently activated by TF·VIIa (18Ruf W. Shobe J. Rao S.M. Dickinson C.D. Olson A. Edgington T.S. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 1957-1966Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). To generate an inactive substrate mimic suitable for competition studies with wild-type X, the catalytic triad Ser-195 was mutated to Ala. When activated by TF·VIIa, this mutant, XArg-15,Ala-195, lacked amidolytic activity. The scissile bond P1 (2Schechter I. Berger A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1967; 27: 157-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (4697) Google Scholar) residue Arg was additionally mutated to Gln in another mutant, XGln-15,Ala-195, to generate a macromolecular substrate mimic that fails to properly dock into the S1 specificity pocket. Both mutants were stably expressed in dihydrofolate reductase-deficient Chinese hamster ovary cells, and each protein was purified from serum-free culture supernatants with immobilized anti-X monoclonal antibody F21–4.2C. Protein with partial degradation of the Gla domain was separated in a barium citrate precipitation step from fully γ-carboxylated protein that has a properly folded Gla domain (18Ruf W. Shobe J. Rao S.M. Dickinson C.D. Olson A. Edgington T.S. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 1957-1966Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The eluates from the barium citrate precipitate were dialyzed extensively against Tris-buffered saline for storage at −70 °C. A final pass over a benzamidine-Sepharose column equilibrated with Tris-buffered saline was used to eliminate trace contaminants of activated X that may have been generated during production or purification of the recombinant protein. The termini of light and heavy chains of the mutants were confirmed by amino-terminal sequencing, which showed <4% yield for Glu-7 and Glu-8, consistent with complete γ-carboxylation of these Gla positions. Km and kcat for X hydrolysis by TF·VIIa were determined with a fixed concentration (200 pm) of TF/PC or TF/PCPS and excess wild-type or mutant VIIa (1 nm) in HEPES-buffered saline (10 mm HEPES, 150 mmNaCl, pH 7.4), 5 mm CaCl2, 0.2% bovine serum albumin. After a brief preincubation (5 min) of TF with VIIa to allow for complex formation, X (0.2 nm to 10 μm) was added, and activation was determined in samples quenched with 100 mm EDTA, using the chromogenic substrate Spectrozyme FXa. Initial rate data were fitted to the Michaelis-Menten equation. The interaction of inactive X mutants with TF·VIIa was analyzed in a competitive inhibition assay with wild-type, plasma-derived X. After forming the TF·VIIa complex on PCPS vesicles under the conditions described above, wild-type X and XArg-15,Ala-195 or XGln-15,Ala-195 were added simultaneously, followed by quenching with EDTA and determination of the generation of active Xa with Spectrozyme FXa. Initial rate data were obtained in three independent experiments for wild-type X concentrations of 0.2–10 μm at each of the inhibitor concentrations used. The means of the initial velocity data were fitted to the Michaelis-Menten equation to determine the apparent Km and kcat for X activation. Both mutants showed competitive inhibition of X activation. Ki values were determined from the replot of the Km values versus the competitor concentration (0–400 nm) for each of the mutants. Amidolytic function of wild-type or mutant VIIa (5 nm) was measured in the presence of increasing concentrations of soluble TF1–218 (0.5–100 nm) with 0.5 mmchromogenic substrate Chromozym t-PA (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) in Tris-buffered saline, 5 mm CaCl2, 0.2% bovine serum albumin, pH 8.0. Kinetic parameters for chromogenic substrate hydrolysis were determined at a fixed enzyme (30 nm) and cofactor TF1–218 (120 nm) concentration with varying concentrations of substrate (1.5 mm to 10 μm) under the same buffer conditions. Binding constants were determined on BIAcore 2000 instruments. Monoclonal antibodies to VII (F3–3.2A) and to TF (TF9–10H10) were directly immobilized by coupling through free amino groups to a carboxylated dextran matrix, activated with a mixture of N-hydroxysuccinimide and N-ethyl-N′-[3-(diethylamino)propyl]carbodiimide, as described previously (29Dickinson C.D. Ruf W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19875-19879Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Association kinetics for binding to F3–3.2A were measured by injecting various concentrations (13 nm to 4 μm) of mutant or wild-type VIIa with or without active site modification onto the antibody-coated sensorchip. Determination of binding kinetics of wild-type and mutant VIIa to TF utilized capturing of full-length TF to the noninhibitory antibody TF9–10H10 (29Dickinson C.D. Ruf W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19875-19879Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Experiments were performed in HEPES-buffered saline, 5 mm CaCl2, 0.005% surfactant P20, and 3 mm Chaps at a 30 μl/min flow rate. Association rate constants (ks) were calculated from at least five concentrations of VIIa. The kon was determined from the concentration dependence of ks, and the koff was determined from analysis of the response curve upon return to buffer flow. To analyze macromolecular substrate docking with TF·VIIa, we mutated the catalytic triad Ser to Ala to generate a catalytically inactive X molecule. In the first mutant, XArg-15,Ala-195, the scissile bond P1 residue Arg was unchanged. As expected, XArg-15,Ala-195 had no measurable catalytic activity after zymogen activation and thus did not interfere with functional amidolytic assays. XArg-15,Ala-195 inhibited the activation of wild-type macromolecular substrate X by phospholipid-associated TF·VIIa. The display of kinetic analysis by Lineweaver-Burk plots demonstrate that XArg-15,Ala-195 has no effect on the vmax but increases the apparent Kmin a dose-dependent manner, consistent with simple competitive inhibition (Fig. 1). The mutant inhibited wild-type X with a Ki of 34 ± 3 nm, which is comparable to the Km for wild-type X activation under these experimental conditions. Hydrolysis of the peptidyl substrate Chromozym t-PA (0.5 mm) by 30 nm VIIa in complex with 120 nmTF1–218 was measured in the presence or absence of 2.5 μm XArg-15,Ala-195. The rate of hydrolysis in the presence (81 ± 5 relative absorbance/min) or absence (83 ± 3 relative absorbance/min) of the inactive X mutant were indistinguishable, supporting the notion that XArg-15,Ala-195 competes with docking of macromolecular substrate, rather than inhibits scissile bond cleavage in the active site cleft. To analyze the importance of the P1 residue for macromolecular substrate affinity, the P1 residue Arg in X was replaced by Gln. Fig. 2 shows the time-dependent activation of catalytically inactive X mutants with either Arg or Gln as the P1 residues. Whereas the activation of XArg-15,Ala-195 approached completion after 15 min, no activation was detectable after 1 h in the case of XGln-15,Ala-195. This demonstrates that mutation of P1 to Gln prevents scissile bond cleavage, which is likely attributable to a failure of the Gln residue to properly bind to the S1 specificity pocket. As found with XArg-15,Ala-195, the P1 Gln mutant XGln-15,Ala-195 (2.5 μm) failed to inhibit amidolytic function of VIIa (30 nm) in complex with 120 nm TF1–218 (83 ± 3 relative absorbance/min without versus 82 ± 3 relative absorbance/min with XGln-15,Ala-195), arguing that this mutant P1 residue does not occupy the S1 subsite without subsequent scissile bond cleavage. XGln-15,Ala-195 was as potent a competitor as XArg-15,Ala-195 for X docking to TF·VIIa. The Lineweaver-Burk plots show competitive inhibition by XGln-15,Ala-195 (Fig. 1), and the calculated Ki of 40 ± 4 nm was indistinguishable from XArg-15,Ala-195. These data demonstrate that the P1 residue in X makes no measurable contribution to the affinity of macromolecular substrate binding to TF·VIIa. This conclusion would predict that mutations in the catalytic cleft of VIIa, to which the activation peptide region of macromolecular substrate binds, should not affect the affinity of TF·VIIa for X. To test this hypothesis, two residue positions in the catalytic cleft were selected for replacement with Ala. On the S subsite, Thr-99 makes contacts with the P2 residue, as shown in the crystal structure of the Phe-Phe-Arg-inhibited TF·VIIa complex (19Banner D.W. D'Arcy A. Chène C. Winkler F.K. Guha A. Konigsberg W.H. Nemerson Y. Kirchhofer D. Nature. 1996; 380: 41-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar). On the S′ subsite, residue Gln-40 was mutated. Although the precise docking of the P′ residues of coagulation serine protease substrates is not known, a recent crystal structure of TF·VIIa in complex with the Kunitz-type inhibitor 5L15 shows contacts of Leu-39, adjacent to Gln-40, with the P2′ position of the inhibitor (32Zhang E. St. Charles R. Tulinsky A. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 2089-2104Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), indicating perturbation of the proximity of the S2′ subsite by the Gln-40 mutation. The mutants were purified to homogeneity and characterized by surface plasmon resonance analysis for binding interactions to validate the overall proper folding of the proteins. The mutations had little effect on VIIa binding to TF (TableI). In addition, active site modification with the covalent inhibitor Phe-Phe-Arg chloromethyl ketone increased affinity for each of the mutants, as previously found for wild-type VIIa (29Dickinson C.D. Ruf W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19875-19879Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). This demonstrates that these mutations in the catalytic cleft do not diminish cofactor binding (TF) or disrupt allosteric changes that link the active site to the cofactor binding site. Using a previously characterized, conformation sensitive monoclonal antibody (F3–3.2A) to the VIIa protease domain exosite that participates in X docking (21Dickinson C.D. Shobe J. Ruf W. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 277: 959-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), we further analyzed conformational changes in this exosite region of VIIa. VIIaAla-40 and VIIaAla-99 bound to F3–3.2A with the same affinity as wild-type VIIa and displayed a loss of affinity upon active site modification in accordance with that of wild-type (Table I). These data argue that the mutational effect of these two replacements is confined to the active site cleft and does not influence the overall conformation or active site occupancy-related allosteric changes in the VIIa protease domain.Table IBinding of VIIa to TF and monoclonal antibody F3–3.2akonkoffm−1s−1s−1Binding to TF1–263 VIIaWild-type1.9 ± 0.5 × 1051.6 ± 0.3 × 10−3VIIaAla-403.3 ± 0.6 × 1053.5 ± 0.3 × 10−3VIIaAla-993.2 ± 0.1 × 1051.5 ± 0.2 × 10−3 FFR-VIIaWild-type3.8 ± 0.8 × 1050.5 ± 0.1 × 10−3VIIaAla-403.3 ± 1.4 × 1050.7 ± 0.1 × 10−3VIIaAla-993.7 ± 0.3 × 1050.7 ± 0.1 × 10−3Binding to F3–3.2A VIIaWild-type9.8 ± 0.6 × 1042.5 ± 0.4 × 10−2VIIaAla-409.7 ± 0.5 × 1042.5 ± 0.2 × 10−2VIIaAla-997.8 ± 0.9 × 1043.1 ± 0.2 × 10−2 FFR-VIIaWild-type1.0 ± 0.2 × 1041.3 ± 0.1 × 10−2VIIaAla-402.1 ± 0.2 × 1041.1 ± 0.1 × 10−2VIIaAla-991.2 ± 0.1 × 1041.3 ± 0.1 × 10−2 Open table in a new tab The unaltered affinity for TF is further demonstrated by dose titration with soluble TF1–218 in the amidolytic assay shown in Fig.3. Whereas VIIaAla-40hydrolyzed the chromogenic substrate Chromozym t-PA with similar efficiency as wild-type VIIa, a dramatic reduction in amidolytic activity for VIIaAla-99 was observed. Kinetic parameters for cleavage of this substrate were determined at a fixed enzyme concentration, demonstrating that the loss of catalytic function of VIIaAla-99 resulted predominantly from a significant decrease in the affinity for the p-nitroanilide substrate (Table II). These results are expected from a modification of the S2 subsite, because the activation of small substrates is highly dependent on the docking to the S1–3 subsite, with little contribution of binding of the p-nitroanilide group to the S′ subsite.Table IICatalytic function of VIIa mutantsKmkcatKinetic parameters for chromogenic substrate hydrolysis TF1–2182-a30 nm VIIa with 120 nM TF1–218.Wild-type VIIa340 ± 50 μm145 ± 342-bRelative absorbance/min.VIIaAla-40440 ± 20 μm117 ± 92-bRelative absorbance/min.VIIaAla-991440 ± 170 μm87 ± 52-bRelative absorbance/min.Kinetic parameters for X activation TF/PCPSWild-type VIIa69 ± 25 nm7.4 ± 0.45 s−1VIIaAla-4067 ± 32 nm3.1 ± 0.5 s−1VIIaAla-9937 ± 11 nm1.3 ± 0.3 s−1TF/PCWild-type VIIa11090 ± 2861 nm1.55 ± 0.15 s−1VIIaAla-4010580 ± 2352 nm0.6 ± 0.1 s−1VIIaAla-999804 ± 2118 nm0.25 ± 0.05 s−12-c 200 pm TF/PC or TF/PCPS with 1 nmVIIa.2-a 30 nm VIIa with 120 nM TF1–218.2-b Relative absorbance/min.

Mutation of Gln-40 at the S′ subsite did not affect the Km, but reduced the kcat2-fold independent of the lipid composition of the vesicles (Table II). These data indicate that S′ subsite docking of the scissile bond makes no contribution to the affinity of macromolecular docking with TF·VIIa, although it is critical for the efficiency of hydrolysis of the peptide bond. This conclusion is further supported by the kinetic parameters for VIIaAla-99 that displayed a greatly reduced affinity for small substrate, which solely bind to the catalytic cleft of VIIa. The kcat for X activation was reduced 6-fold upon Thr-99 mutation, but the Km was unchanged. Mutations of catalytic cleft residues in VIIa thus do not influence macromolecular substrate affinity, although scissile bond-mimicking chromogenic substrates display an increased Km for these mutants. These data are consistent with the conclusions drawn from the analysis of mutations of the X P1 position that also did not influence the affinity for TF·VIIa. Based on these results, one would further predict that the affinities of the inactive X mutants for TF·VIIa are not influenced by the mutations in the catalytic cleft of VIIa. XArg-15,Ala-195 and XGln-15,Ala-195 were used as competitive inhibitors for wild-type X activation by both VIIa mutants in the presence of TF. The inactive X mutants exhibited pure competitive inhibition with each of the VIIa mutants, as shown for wild-type VIIa in Fig. 1. The Ki values calculated for these experiments (Table III) demonstrate that XArg-15,Ala-195 bound to each of the mutants with the same affinity as to wild-type VIIa in complex with TF. Furthermore, there was no effect of mutation of the P1 Arg residue to Gln on the affinity for the VIIa mutants. These data thus emphasize that neither docking of the scissile bond P1 residue nor interaction at the S or the S′ subsites contributes to X affinity for TF·VIIa, indicating that substrate recognition at exosite regions of cofactor and enzyme is the key determinant for macromolecular substrate binding and specificity.Table IIICompetitive inhibition of X activation by inactive X mutantsCompetition byAffinity for wild-type X activation (Km)XArg-15,Ala-195(Ki)XGln-15,Ala-195(Ki)nmnmWild-type VIIa34 ± 340 ± 440 ± 5VIIaAla-4032 ± 436 ± 346 ± 15VIIaAla-9929 ± 630 ± 828 ± 4 Open table in a new tab In this study, site-specific mutagenesis was employed to determine whether binding of the activation peptide region of X to the active site cleft of TF·VIIa plays a significant role in macromolecular substrate affinity. In two independent experimental approaches, we found that scissile bond docking does not measurably contribute to macromolecular substrate affinity of the TF·VIIa complex. First, we generated catalytically inactive X mutants that can be used in a competitive assay with wild-type X. XArg-15,Ala-195 showed pure competitive inhibition of wild-type X activation by TF·VIIa with a Ki that was indistinguishable from the Km of wild-type X activation. Thus, this mutant truly recapitulates the docking of the macromolecular substrate. Mutation of the P1 Arg residue in XGln-15,Ala-195 produced a mutant that was resistant to activation by TF·VIIa and that did not inhibit amidolytic function of the complex, indicating that the mutated P1 residue fails to bind productively to the S1 subsite of the enzyme. XGln-15,Ala-195 was equally potent as XArg-15,Ala-195 as a competitive inhibitor of X activation by TF·VIIa, demonstrating that P1 docking to the S1 subsite makes no appreciable contributions to macromolecular substrate binding with TF·VIIa in a physiologically assembled ternary complex. Second, mutations of residues in the S and S′ subsites of the catalytic cleft did not increase the Km for macromolecular substrate activation. The mutation of the S2 subsite residue significantly reduced the affinity for a small chromogenic p-nitroanilide substrate without major effects on the kcat, demonstrating that the catalytic cleft structure is sufficiently perturbed to interfere with normal docking of activation peptide-mimicking pseudosubstrates. However, the mutations in the catalytic cleft of VIIa only reduced the kcat of macromolecular substrate X activation, suggesting that transition state formation and the subsequent acylation/deacylation steps are rate-limiting in protein substrate activation. These data are consistent with a two step process in which macromolecular substrate docking precedes scissile bond interactions with the catalytic cleft, as suggested for prothrombin activation (23Krishnaswamy S. Betz A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12080-12086Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar,24Betz A. Krishnaswamy S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10709-10718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Other mutations in or near the catalytic cleft of VIIa have previously been shown to have a similar effect on X activation. In particular, Ala replacements for Lys-192 (33Shobe J. Dickinson C.D. Ruf W. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 2745-2751Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), located just above the S1 pocket, and the immediately adjacent Arg-148 in the autolysis loop (27Ruf W. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 11631-11636Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) both reduced the kcat for X activation without influencing the Km. Because Arg-148 is localized in one of the nonconserved loop regions of the serine protease domain that are considered important for substrate specificity (34Furie B. Bing D.H. Feldmann R.J. Robison D.J. Burnier J.P. Furie B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 3875-3882Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the selective effect of the Arg-148 mutation on the kcat may indicate that even these specificity determinants more distant from the scissile bond, but in proximity to the catalytic cleft, are not involved in the initial docking of macromolecular substrate. Indirect support for a minor importance of scissile bond docking for macromolecular substrate affinity is further provided by the kinetic mechanism of inhibitors of the TF·VIIa complex. Both the nematode inhibitor NAPc2 (35Stanssens P. Bergum P.W. Gansemans Y. Jespers L. Laroche Y. Huang S. Maki S. Messens J. Lauwereys M. Cappello M. Hotez P.J. Lasters I. Vlasuk G.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2149-2154Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar) and the natural inhibitor of TF pathway inhibitor (36Broze G.J. Annu. Rev. Med. 1995; 46: 103-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar), are dependent on the product Xa for efficient inhibition of the TF·VIIa complex. Kinetic analysis of the mechanism of inhibition in the latter case clearly demonstrated that the preferred target for inhibition by TFPI is the ternary complex of TF·VIIa·Xa (37Baugh R.J. Broze Jr., G.J. Krishnaswamy S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4378-4386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar), emphasizing that extended macromolecular substrate interactions that may be partially preserved in the product are of sufficient affinity to transiently stabilize the ternary complex. The Gla domain of substrate X is critical for binding to the collision structure of TF and the VIIa Gla domain (15Ruf W. Miles D.J. Rehemtulla A. Edgington T.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6375-6381Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Huang Q. Neuenschwander P.F. Rezaie A.R. Morrissey J.H. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 1957-1966Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), and mutations in TF that reduce substrate binding also influence the inhibition by the TFPI·Xa complex (38Rao L.V.M. Ruf W. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10867-10871Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Furthermore, fusion of the light chain of Xa amino-terminal to TFPI generates an inhibitor chimera with greatly enhanced affinity for TF·VIIa as compared with TFPI alone (39Girard T.J. MacPhail L.A. Likert K.M. Novotny W.F. Miletich J.P. Broze J. Science. 1990; 248: 1421-1424Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). It thus appears that the light chains of the upstream coagulation proteases evolved to direct the specificity of the interactions between substrates and the cell surface-associated enzyme-cofactor complexes. The kinetic mechanism of activation of X by TF·VIIa may serve to illustrate a fundamental difference between serine proteases that initiate and propagate enzyme cascades as opposed to effector proteases. Whereas the former typically function in a membrane-localized environment, the latter frequently require diffusion to specific targets and catalyze fluid phase reactions, such as the conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin by thrombin. High affinity for product would significantly impair the catalytic rate of effector proteases. To reduce product inhibition, the cleavage bond vicinity of substrate may have been preferentially evolved as the major determinant for substrate affinity for effector proteases. In contrast, the rate of cleavage may be of secondary importance relative to the requirement for a high degree of specificity in recognition of homologous enzymes when activating an amplifying, consecutive cascade. The versatility of extended recognition surfaces to generate highly specific reaction partners from similar protein modules may have been the driving force in the evolution of enzyme cascades, such as the coagulation system. The high degree of biological fidelity that was achieved by creating specificity through extended recognition surfaces of enzyme-cofactor complexes may have resulted in a lack of evolutionary pressure to imprint substrate affinity and specificity into recognition determinants of the catalytic cleft.

Recently we demonstrated that uPA activates the Janus kinase/signal transducers and activators of transcription (Stat1) signaling in human vascular smooth muscle and endothelial cells. However, the important question whether other transcription factors of the Stat family, in addition to Stat1, are involved in the uPAR-related signaling has not been addressed. In this study, we demonstrate that Stat4 and Stat2, but not Stat3, Stat5, or Stat6, are rapidly activated in response to uPA. We demonstrate further that Stat4 and Stat2 rapidly and transiently translocate to the cell nucleus where they bind specifically to the regulatory DNA elements. Analysis of Stat complexes formed in response to uPA revealed a Stat2-Stat1 heterodimer, which lacks p48, a DNA-binding protein known to combine with Stat1-Stat2. This new uPA-induced Stat2-Stat1 heterodimer binds to GAS (the interferon-γ activation site) distinct from the interferon-stimulated response element to which the p48 protein containing complexes generally bind.

Activated via receptor-associated Jaks, Stat proteins can form homo- or heterodimers in which the phosphotyrosine of one partner binds to the SH2 domain of the other (3Ihle J.N. Cell. 1996; 84: 331-334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1265) Google Scholar). Activated Stat dimers translocate then to the cell nucleus where they bind to specific DNA sequences leading to transcriptional activation of target genes (4Horvath C.M. Darnell Jr., J.E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 233-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). The ability of individual receptors to activate overlapping but distinct sets of Stat complexes contributes to their signal specificity. Another important level of specificity in Stat signaling is based on the unique sequence recognition by each homo- or heterodimer that is formed from activated Stat monomers (5Leaman D.W. Leung S. Li X. Stark G.R. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 1578-1588Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Stats were first described as components of interferon signaling triggered via the activation of the cytokine receptor superfamily (1Darnell Jr., J.E. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Science. 1994; 264: 1415-1421Crossref PubMed Scopus (4977) Google Scholar). However, a substantial body of evidence has recently accumulated suggesting that Stats are also involved in transducing signals initiated by other receptors, such as growth factors receptor tyrosine kinases (5Leaman D.W. Leung S. Li X. Stark G.R. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 1578-1588Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar), G-protein-coupled receptors (6Bhat G.J. Thekkumkara T.J. Thomas W.G. Conrad K.M. Baker K.M. J.

The urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR) is a multifunctional protein responsible for several processes such as direction of cell-surface proteolysis in space and time, regulation of cellular adhesion, cell migration, and proliferation (see Refs. 8Blasi F.

However, a molecular basis for the biochemical events involved in the uPAR-mediated signaling leading to gene expression is still incompletely understood. Recently we have demonstrated that in human vascular smooth muscle (VSMC) and endothelial cells, uPAR is associated with two kinases of the Janus family, Jak1 and Tyk2 (18Dumler I. Weis A. Mayboroda O.A. Maasch C. Jerke U. Haller H. Gulba D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 315-321Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 19Dumler I. Kopmann A. Weis A. Mayboroda O.A. Wagner K. Gulba D.C. Haller H. Arterioscl. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1999; 19: 290-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). uPAR activation by its ligand, urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA), leads to the activation of these kinases, which, in turn, provide the activation of Stat1 and its subsequent translocation to the nucleus. uPAR association with the Jak1/Stat1 pathway was also shown in human kidney epithelial tumor cells (20Koshelnick Y. Ehart M. Hufnagl P. Heinrich P.C. Binder B.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28563-28567Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). However, the question of how and to what extent other Stats contribute to VSMC uPA responsiveness or whether Stat1 is the only Stat protein involved in the uPAR-induced intracellular signaling has yet not been addressed. Besides formation of homodimers, activated Stat1 can form heterodimers in combination with Stat3 or Stat2. The Stat1-Stat3 heterodimer binds to the interferon-γ activation site (GAS), whereas the Stat1-Stat2 heterodimer associates with DNA-binding protein p48 to form the transcription factor ISGF3, which recognizes an interferon-stimulated response element (ISRE) present in many promoters activated by interferon-α/β (see Refs. 3Ihle J.N.

Cytokine Res. 1997; 17: 121-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). Stat4, Stat5, and Stat6 have yet to be shown to form heterodimeric complexes, although the highly related isoforms of some of these Stats form heterodimers (7Cella N. Groner B. Hynes N.E. Mol. Cell.

In this study, we investigated the responsiveness of various Stat proteins to ligand-induced activation of uPAR in human VSMC. We demonstrate that, in addition to Stat1, Stat2 and Stat4 are activated in response to uPA. Upon uPA stimulation, both Stats are tyrosine-phosphorylated and translocate to the nucleus where they bind to specific DNA elements. Analysis of Stat complexes formed in response to uPA revealed a Stat2-Stat1 heterodimer that lacks p48, a DNA-binding protein known to combine with Stat1-Stat2. This new uPA-induced Stat2-Stat1 heterodimer binds to the GAS element distinct from ISRE to which the p48 protein-containing complexes generally bind.

A solution of 1% Nonidet P-40 was added to a final concentration of 0.1%. The pellets were incubated on ice for 40 min and homogenized by 30 strokes in a Teflon glass Dounce homogenizer. The homogenates were adjusted to 1.4 m sucrose by the addition of 2.1 m sucrose in buffer A. 8 ml of this suspension were transferred to each centrifuge tube and laid between 1 ml of 2.1 m and 2 ml of 0.8 m sucrose in buffer A. The tubes were filled up with 1 ml of 0.25 m sucrose in buffer A and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 65 min at 4 °C in a swinging bucket rotor. The pellets containing the nuclei were resuspended in a small volume of buffer B (20 mmHEPES, 20% glycerol, 100 mm KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitors).

In supershift EMSA, nuclear extracts were incubated with 2 μg of experimental or isotypic control antibody prior to the addition of a 32P-labeled probe. DNA-protein complexes were separated on a 5% polyacrylamide gel in Tris-glycin buffer (50 mm Tris, 0.4 m glycin, 2 mm EDTA). The following double-stranded oligonucleotides were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. and were used in this study: GAS/ISRE, 27 bp (catalog no. 2537); Stat4, 27 bp (catalog no. 2569); Stat1, 25 bp (catalog no. 2573); AP-1, 21 bp (catalog no. 2501); and NFκB, 22 bp (catalog no. 2505). 5′ end-labeled probes were prepared with 40 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP using a T4 polynucleotide kinase and were gel-purified on NAP-5 Sephadex G-25 DNA grade columns. For the staining in uPA-induced nuclear translocation experiments, the cells were fixed on glass coverslips with 4% paraformaldehyde and were permeabilized with 80% methanol at −20 °C. After overnight incubation at 4 °C with 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS, the preparations were treated with anti-Stat or anti-Stat4 monoclonal antibodies or control monoclonal antibodies all diluted (5 μg/ml) in 0.2% bovine serum albumin/PBS. The samples were washed three times in PBS and incubated in the dark humid chamber with Cy2- or Alexa-488-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (5–10 μg/ml). The coverslips were washed four times in PBS and embedded in Aqua-Poly/Mount mounting media. The images were acquired with NORAN Instrument Odyssey XL laser scanning confocal microscope supported with Intervision 1.5 software with an argon-krypton laser. Each experiment has been repeated at least five times, and the representative figures have been shown. For confocal microscopy studies at least 20–40 cells from at least seven separate experiments were examined under each experimental condition. Cytoplasmic extracts of uPA-treated or -untreated VSMC were precipitated using one of six (anti-Stat1, Stat2, Stat3, Stat4, Stat5, and Stat6) antibodies, separated by SDS-PAGE, and examined for phosphotyrosine incorporation into the proteins of Stats size range. Reprobing of stripped blots with antibodies to individual Stat proteins was used for their identification in the immunoprecipitates. In addition to the previously observed activation of Stat1 (18Dumler I. Weis A. Mayboroda O.A. Maasch C. Jerke U. Haller H. Gulba D.C. J. Biol.

The kinetics of this activation peaked relatively fast after 8–10 min of stimulation for both Stats and decreased after 15 min of stimulation. The phosphorylation of Stat4 remained at this basal level, whereas Stat2 showed a second reversible uPA-induced peak of tyrosine phosphorylation after 20 min of stimulation. To determine whether uPA-induced activation of Stat2 and Stat4 results in their translocation to the cell nucleus, we resorted to laser scanning confocal microscopy to analyze the subcellular localization of both Stats. As shown in Figs. 2 and3, uPA-activated Stat2 and Stat4 translocated efficiently into the nucleus. The kinetics of this translocation were very close to the kinetics of their tyrosine phosphorylation in response to uPA. Five to ten min of cell activation resulted in predominantly nuclear staining for both Stats, which declined after 13–15 min, although Stat2 demonstrated again a second response phase peaking after 20 min of cell stimulation.Figure 3uPA-induced nuclear translocation of Stat4. The subconfluent VSMC monolayer was treated with uPA, fixed, and stained as described in the legend to Fig. 2. Monoclonal anti-Stat4 antibody was used for staining.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To explore whether the uPA-induced Stat factors could bind DNA, we used two oligonucleotide probes, the GAS/ISRE probe, which serves as binding sites for various activated Stats, and the GAS-like probe possessing a high binding specificity for Stat4 (Stat4 gel shift oligonucleotide) (23Yamamoto K. Miura O. Hirosawa S. Miyasaka N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 233: 126-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Complex formation with these probes was examined by EMSA using nuclear extracts from untreated cells and stimulated with uPA cells (Fig. 4). uPA induced the formation of at least one prominent nuclear complex with a GAS/ISRE probe within 10 min of stimulation (Fig. 4 A). In addition, two more slowly migrating complexes were observed. However, this was not a consistent finding; they were only weakly detectable and were unaffected by uPA treatment. No binding to the GAS/ISRE was detected in the presence of excess unlabeled GAS/ISRE, whereas an unrelated oligonucleotide did not change the DNA-protein binding (Fig.4 A). To detect specific Stat proteins in the uPA-inducible DNA-protein complex, gel supershift assays with Stat-specific antibodies were performed. Stat1 and Stat2 antibodies, but not antibodies to Stat3, Stat4, Stat5, or Stat6, blocked (Stat1) and supershifted (Stat2) the complex (Fig. 4 A and data not shown). Surprisingly, antibody to p48, a DNA-binding protein that associates with Stat1 and Stat2 to form the transcription factor ISGF3 (24Wong L.H. Krauer K.G. Hatzinisiriou I. Estcourt M.J. Hersey P.

Chem. 1997; 272: 28779-28785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar), did not supershift or block the uPA-induced complex (Fig.4 A). Use of the Stat4-specific probe enabled further identification of uPA-activated Stat proteins in DNA binding complexes (Fig.4 B). With this probe, two complexes were observed. One complex of slow mobility was induced by uPA stimulation within 7–10 min, was specific, as shown in cold competition EMSA experiments, and was completely supershifted by anti-Stat4 antibody (Fig.4 B), whereas antibodies to other Stat proteins were ineffective. The second complex had a mobility similar to the uPA-induced GAS/ISRE complex; however, it was not reproducibly enchanced by uPA when this probe was used. In response to stimulation, tyrosine phosphorylated Stat1 and Stat2 multimerize to form either Stat1 homodimers that bind GAS sequence through an intrinsic DNA binding domain or Stat1-Stat2 heterodimers that bind ISRE sequences through the DNA binding domain of p48 (3Ihle J.N. Cell. 1996; 84: 331-334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1265) Google Scholar, 4Horvath C.M. Darnell Jr., J.E. Curr. Opin.

Because uPA induces activation of both Stat1 (as shown by us previously in Refs. 18Dumler I. Weis A. Mayboroda O.A. Maasch C. Jerke U. Haller H. Gulba D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 315-321Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar and 19Dumler I. Kopmann A. Weis A. Mayboroda O.A. Wagner K. Gulba D.C. Haller H. Arterioscl. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1999; 19: 290-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) and Stat2 and considering that only one uPA-related complex was observed in our EMSA experiments, we explored the possibility of Stat1-Stat2 heterodimer formation in response to uPA. To probe for heterodimers, coimmunoprecipitation of Stat1 and Stat2 was examined (Fig.5 A). The Stat2 protein was immunoprecipitated from the activated form at different time points, and the immunoprecipitates were screened after PAGE and electroblotting with antibody specific for the Stat1 tyrosine-phosphorylated site (Stat1 Tyr701). The results of these experiments clearly demonstrate that Stat1 was indeed associated with the Stat2 protein in uPA-stimulated cells. Moreover, this Stat2-associated Stat1 protein underwent tyrosine phosphorylation with kinetics very similar to those revealed by Stat2 in response to uPA (Figs. 1 A and5 A, upper panel). Phosphorylation of Stat1 increased within 5 min after uPA stimulation, decreased by 15 min, and peaked again by 20 min. Reprobing of the blots with anti-Stat2 antibody confirmed equal protein loading onto the gel (Fig. 5 A, lower panel). Development of the blot after its stripping with anti-p48 antibody did not reveal any positive signal, whereas in the whole cell lysates the p48 protein was available (data not shown). Formation of a Stat1-Stat2 complex lacking a p48 protein was proven in the next experiments using chemical cross-linking (Fig.5 B). uPA-stimulated cells were subjected to cross-linking using the bifunctional chemical cross-linker disuccinimidyl suberate, as described under “Experimental Procedures,” followed by immunoprecipitation with anti-Stat1 antibody. The immunoprecipitated proteins were then separated by PAGE, immunoblotted with anti-Stat2, and reprobed with anti-p48 antibodies. An additional high molecular mass complex about 200 kDa was revealed in the cells subjected to cross-linking. As in the above described experiments, no p48 protein was found in the immunoprecipitates before or after cross-linking. Heterodimer Stat1-Stat2 is distinct from other Stat complexes in that it requires a non-Stat molecule, p48, which is a critical DNA binding component directing complex binding to ISRE sequences through its own DNA binding domain. Because we did not find p48 in the uPA-induced Stat1-Stat2 complexes, we explored the ability of these heterodimers to bind the palindromic GAS DNA sequence. The induction of GAS binding activity attributable to the Stat1-Stat2 complex was determined in EMSA using nuclear extracts and a Stat1-specific GAS oligonucleotide probe. Fig. 5 C shows that uPA induced DNA binding activity in a biphasic manner; the first peak of complex formation was observed after 5 min of stimulation, and the second one was observed after 15 min. Antibodies used in our study that specifically recognize Stat1 and Stat2 shifted this complex when added to the DNA binding reaction demonstrating the presence of the Stat1 and Stat2 proteins in the complex. In this study, we demonstrate that, in addition to Stat1, Stat2 and Stat4 are activated in response to uPA in human VSMC. Upon uPA stimulation, both Stats are tyrosine-phosphorylated and translocate to the nucleus where they bind to DNA elements. Analysis of Stat complexes formed in response to uPA revealed a new Stat2-Stat1 heterodimer that lacks p48 protein and binds to the GAS DNA sequence. Some cytokines and growth factors are known to promote tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of more than one Stat protein (1Darnell Jr., J.E. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Science. 1994; 264: 1415-1421Crossref PubMed Scopus (4977) Google Scholar, 2Briscoe J. Guschin D. Müller M. Curr.

This observation together with the data that only seven different Stat proteins have been identified raises the question about the mechanisms underlying transcriptional specificity of cytokine and growth factor signaling. In part, this specificity might be explained by a different pattern of activation of each Stat family member. Moreover, particular Stats are activated differently in response to growth factors and cytokine depending upon the cell type (5Leaman D.W. Leung S. Li X. Stark G.R. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 1578-1588Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). However, the most important level of specificity in Stat signaling is achieved via selective interactions of individual Stats upon complex formation that allow specific binding of these complexes to DNA consensus sequences (3Ihle J.N. Cell. 1996; 84: 331-334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1265) Google Scholar, 4Horvath C.M. Darnell Jr., J.E. Curr. Opin.

Recent findings revealed also that Stats bound to a distinct pattern of adjacent sites, none of which bear a close resemblance to the high affinity sequence identified by the random selection method (25Baden H.A. Sarma S.P. Kapust R.B. Byrd R.A. Waugh D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17109-17114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Our finding that physiological concentration of uPA is able to induce Stat4 activation, such as tyrosine phosphorylation, nuclear translocation, and binding to the DNA Stat4-specific GAS element, is, to our knowledge, the first indication that there is at least one more natural ligand for the Stat4 protein beyond interleukin-12. Interleukin-12 is known to be unique in inducing activation of Stat4 and the subsequent formation of protein-DNA complexes in human natural killer cells, T helper cells, and lymphocytes (26Jacobson N.G. Szabo S.J. Weber-Nordt R.M. Zhong Z. Schreiber R.D. Darnell Jr., J.E. Murphy K.M. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 1755-1762Crossref PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar, 27Bacon C.M. Petricoin III, E.F.

Dumler, A. Kopmann, K. Wagner, O. A. Mayboroda, U. Jerke, R. Dietz, H. Haller, and D. C. Gulba, unpublished observations. suggested that other Stat4-activating natural ligands might exist. In response to interleukin-12, the Stat4 GAS binding homodimer is generally induced (25Baden H.A. Sarma S.P. Kapust R.B. Byrd R.A. Waugh D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17109-17114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). However, there are some findings demonstrating that at least two additional Stat4-containing complexes do exist. Thus, Stat4-Stat3 and Stat4-Stat1α heterodimers have been found in some cells (26Jacobson N.G. Szabo S.J. Weber-Nordt R.M. Zhong Z. Schreiber R.D. Darnell Jr., J.E. Murphy K.M. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 1755-1762Crossref PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar, 27Bacon C.M. Petricoin III, E.F. Ortaldo J.R. Rees R.C. Larner A.C. Johnston J.A. O'Shea J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Immunol. 1996; 157: 126-137PubMed Google Scholar), although the level of Stat3 phosphorylation was minimal and the significance of this finding is unclear. Based on our results from coimmunoprecipitation, tyrosine phosphorylation, and the reactivity with antibodies in EMSA it is likely that uPA induces in VSMC complexes containing Stat4 only. However, we cannot rule out that some unknown Stat-unrelated proteins might also be a component of these complexes or that uPA might induce binding of these Stat4-containing complexes to other DNA sequences distinct from GAS. Our study aiming at the uPA-induced Stat2 activation clearly demonstrates that Stat2 undergoes tyrosine phosphorylation, nuclear translocation, and DNA binding in response to uPA. Notably, these processes revealed biphasic kinetics, peaking first at 5–8 min of activation and then, after some decrease, again at 15–20 min. Interestingly, a similar biphasic activation of Stat1 and Stat2 was shown in rat cardiomyocytes activated by angiotensin (30Kodama H. Fukuda K. Pan J. Makino S. Sano M. Takahashi T. Hori S. Ogawa S. Circ. Res. 1998; 82: 244-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). However, when the GAS/ISRE probe was used in our EMSA experiments, the time course of complex formation was different, peaking only once at 10 min, which confirms our previous data about the uPA-induced Stat1-GAS/ISRE binding (18Dumler I. Weis A. Mayboroda O.A. Maasch C. Jerke U. Haller H. Gulba D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 315-321Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 19Dumler I. Kopmann A. Weis A. Mayboroda O.A. Wagner K. Gulba D.C. Haller H. Arterioscl. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1999; 19: 290-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). These results also suggest that the use of the GAS probe favors the binding of a Stat2-containing complex in a biphasic manner. Experiments exploring a composition of a uPA-induced Stat2-containing complex, such as coimmunoprecipitation, tyrosine phosphorylation, cross-linking, gel-shift, and supershift analyses, revealed the formation in human VSMC of a novel uPA-inducible factor consisting of Stat1 and Stat2. Stat1 protein coimmunoprecipitated in these experiments with Stat2 demonstrated the same uPA-induced biphasic activation of tyrosine phosphorylation, as Stat2 did. These data indicate that both components of the heterodimer are activated simultaneously in response to uPA. Of particular interest is the notion that the Stat1-Stat2 heterodimer does not include p48 and binds to the GAS sequence. At least, under our experimental conditions we did not determine p48 after Stat1-Stat2 coimmunoprecipitation or after cross-linking. Use of anti-p48 antibody in EMSA also did not reveal any effect. These data point to a revision of the standard model where it has been assumed that all three subunits are required for specific DNA binding, which is directed to the ISRE. Our results might be strengthened by the findings of others confirming the existence of unusual Stat1-Stat2 complexes in some cells. Thus, the existence of two different complexes following interferon-α stimulation, Stat2-p48 and Stat2-Stat1, has been shown (31Martinez-Moczygemba M. Gutch M.J. French D.L. Reich N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20070-20076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Association of the bipartite complexes appears to occur on the DNA ISRE target to form a multimeric ISGF3 transcription factor. In addition, it was demonstrated that Stat2 is capable of forming a stable homodimer that interacts with p48, can be recruited to DNA, and can activate transcription; this raises the question of why Stat1 is required (32Bluyssen H.A.R. Levy D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4600-4605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). However, these Stat2-p48 complexes were very unstable, although it is possible that Stat2 homodimers might bind to a DNA sequence distinct from either the ISRE or the GAS element. Additional evidence for Stat1-Stat2 dimers capable of forming a functional DNA binding domain in the absence of p48 has been provided by Li et al. (33Li X. Leung S. Qureshi S. Darnell Jr., J.E. Stark G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5790-5794Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar), who showed that these dimers could bind to a palindromic GAS sequence. Interestingly, the heterodimers were also able to interact with p48 to form ISGF3. The biological significance of uPA-inducible Stat1-Stat2 complexes, as well as the functional role of uPA-related Jak/Stat activation, is difficult to assess, and it needs further intensive study. However, it is obvious that uPA activates a specific and unusual subset of latent cytoplasmic transcription factors in human VSMC that suggests a critical role of uPA in these cells, which might confer specificity of a rapid and specific biological response.

Congestive heart failure results in desensitization of the myocardium to Ca2+ as well as depressed cardiac contractility. A promising approach to the treatment of congestive heart failure is the development of positive inotropic Ca2+-sensitizing agents that are capable of increasing the sensitivity of myocardium to Ca2+, thereby compensating for low cardiac output. Ideal calcium-sensitizing compounds would enhance the maximal force of muscle contraction without increasing Ca2+ ion flux into the cell or impairing relaxation in the failing myocardium. In addition, the compound should not inhibit phosphodiesterase activity (1Holubarsch C. Cardiology. 1997; 88 Suppl. 2: 12-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) to minimize the possibility of heart arrhythmias and increased energy consumption in the heart (2Endoh M. Jpn. Heart J. 1998; 39: 1-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Based on these criteria, cardiac troponin C (cTnC)1 is an attractive target for potential Ca2+-sensitizing compounds. Cardiac troponin C is the EF-hand Ca2+ receptor in the thin filament of slow skeletal and cardiac striated muscle. The contraction relaxation cycle is regulated by the binding and release of Ca2+ ions from the N-terminal regulatory site II of cTnC. Compounds that bind with high affinity and selectivity to cTnC and increase the affinity of Ca2+ binding to site II could potentially increase the Ca2+ sensitivity of myocardial contraction without altering Ca2+ transients. Knowledge of the structure and surface topology of cTnC is critical for an understanding of how existing Ca2+-sensitizing compounds interact with cTnC and to identify potential binding sites for new and more effective compounds. Previous structural models for cTnC based on known structures for Ca2+-bound fast skeletal troponin C (3Herzberg O. James M.N.

Ca2+-sensitizing compounds such as bepridil, levosimendan, pimobendan, and trifluoperazine were thought to bind to this predicted hydrophobic surface (6Martin S.R. Maune J.F. Beckingham K.

Amplified DNA was purified and digested with Nco I and Hin dIII and subcloned into pET-23d (Novagen). The cTnI plasmid was transformed into E. coli strain Novablue (Novagen). Positive clones were confirmed by dideoxy DNA sequence analysis. Both Cys81 and Cys98 were changed to Ser using the ChameleonTM double-stranded, site-directed mutagenesis kit from Stratagene and the following primers: C81S, 5′-CGCGTTCTGAGGACTCGTTCTCAGCCTTTGGAGTTGGATG-3′; C98S, 5′-GAAGAGCTTCAGGACTTATCTCGACAGCTTCACGCTCGG-3′;Sca lI-Mlu I primer, 5′-CTGTGACTGGTGACGCGTCAACCAAGTC-3′; and Mlu I-Sca II primer, 5′-GCTTTTCTGTGACTGGTGAGTACTCAACCAAGTC-3′. The monocysteine derivative cTnI(C81S) was produced in the first round of mutagenesis using the Scal I-Mlu I oligo as the selection primer. After selection, isolation, and confirmation of the sequence of cTnI(C81S), this plasmid DNA was used to introduce the Cys98 to Ser98 mutation in a second round of mutagenesis. The subsequent cTnI(A-Cys) plasmid was confirmed by restriction digestion and sequencing. Generation of the truncated cTnI33–211(A-Cys) plasmid and subsequent purification of the protein followed the method used by Guo et al. (17Guo X. Wattanapermpool J. Palmiter K.A. Murphy A.M. Solaro R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15210-15216Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), with minor modifications. The coding sequence corresponding to amino acids 33–211 of cTnI(A-Cys) was amplified by PCR using the 5′ primer reported by Guo et al. (17Guo X. Wattanapermpool J. Palmiter K.A. Murphy A.M. Solaro R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15210-15216Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and a 3′ primer, the T7 terminator primer (Novagen). The subsequent PCR product was cloned into pET-23d using the Nco I and Hin dIII sites. After confirmation of the sequence, the construct was transformed into BL21(DE3) for overexpression. Purification of cTnI33–211(A-Cys) protein was done essentially as reported previously for cTnI33–211(17Guo X. Wattanapermpool J. Palmiter K.A. Murphy A.M. Solaro R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15210-15216Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The bacterial expression of cTnC(A-Cys) and cTnC3 and their labeling with [methyl- 13C]Met and purification were reported previously (18Putkey J.A. Dotson D.G. Mouawad P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6827-6830Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Lin X. Krudy G.A. Howarth J. Brito R.M.M. Rosevear P.R. Putkey J.A.

The NMR samples varied in protein concentration from 0.1 to 1 mm in NMR buffer consisting of either 20 mm Tris-dll, 200 mm KCl, and D2O (pH 7.0) or 10 mm HEPES, 100 mm KCl, and D2O (pH 7.0). Buffers used to prepare cTnC3 included five equivalents of dithiothreitol to reduce the Cys residues. In some experiments, the ionic strength or pH of the NMR samples was varied. Reconstitution of the binary complex with cTnC and cTnI was carried out by the method of Potter (21Potter J.D. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 85: 241-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). All spectra, except for those in Fig. 3, were collected at 40 °C on a Bruker AMX500 NMR spectrometer. HSQC (22Yokoshiki H. Katsube Y. Sunagawa M. Sperelakis N. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1997; 333: 249-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar) spectra were collected with 1024 complex data points in the t2 domain and 72 increments in t1. The experiments took approximately 26 min to complete per titration point. The 1H and 13C spectra widths were 6012 and 600 Hz, respectively. 1H and 13C chemical shifts were reported relative to the H2O signal at 4.563 ppm and the [methyl- 13C]Met signal at 14.86 ppm, respectively. All spectra were processed using the FELIX software package (Biosym Technologies, Inc.). Levosimendan is a light-sensitive drug; therefore, all stock solutions of the drug were prepared and stored in the dark. Stock solutions of levosimendan were prepared immediately before use in deuterated Me2SO or as described previously (8Pollesello P. Ovaska M. Kaivola J. Tilgmann C. Lundström K. Kalkkinen N. Ulmanen I. Nissinen E. Taskinen J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28584-28590Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After adding the drug to the protein, the sample pH was adjusted when necessary. The stock solution of EMD 57033 was prepared in deuterated DMSO immediately before use. Bepridil was prepared as reported previously (11Kleerekoper Q. Liu W. Choi D. Putkey J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8153-8160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Matrix-assisted UV laser desorption mass spectroscopy spectra were acquired using a PerSeptive Voyager Elite Time of Flight mass spectrometer equipped with a delayed extraction and a nitrogen laser (337 mm). A saturated solution of (2,5)-dihydroxybenzoic acid in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in H2O was used as a matrix. 0.5 μl of matrix was mixed with 0.5 μl of sample, placed on the target, and dried at room temperature while protected from light. The sample was a 1:10 dilution in H20 of the appropriate drug stock. The spectra in this study represent the summation of ∼40 laser shots. In addition to the matrix-assisted UV laser desorption mass spectroscopy analysis, a Kratos MS50 fast atom bombardment was used to analyze the levosimendan provided by Orion-Farmos. 3-Nitrobenzyl alcohol was used as a matrix. Dialysis was carried out at 25 °C using two-chamber equilibrium dialysis units from Sialmed, Inc. Each chamber had a 0.1 ml capacity. Prepared dialysis membranes (Life Technologies, Inc.) had a molecular mass cutoff of 12,000–14,000 daltons. Protein was added to one chamber at a concentration of about 0.2 mm to approximate the concentration used in NMR experiments. Protein was prepared in buffers of 20 mm Tris, pH 7.0, and 200 mm KCl or 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, and 100 mm KCl. Drug was added to the opposing chamber at concentrations between 0.2 and 0.4 mm in the corresponding buffer. Sufficient CaCl2 was added to saturate all three Ca2+binding sites on the protein. After equilibration (typically 16 h), aliquots of samples from both chambers were diluted at least 50-fold and assayed spectrophotometrically at 406 nm for levosimendan (ε = 93,285 cm−1m−1) and 296 nm for bepridil (ε = 3,544 cm−1m−1). After dilution, and at these wavelengths, the protein contributed insignificantly to total absorbance. The concentration of cTnC(A-Cys) in the samples was determined by the method of Bradford (23Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216428) Google Scholar) and bicinchoninic acid assay (24Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H. Provenzano M.D. Fujimoto E.K. Goeke N.M. Olson B.J. Klenk D.C. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (18647) Google Scholar). A competitive dye binding assay to determine the relative Ca2+ binding properties of cTnC in the presence and absence of levosimendan was accomplished essentially as described previously by Linse et al. (25Linse S. Helmersson A. Forsén S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8050-8054Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Apo cTnC(A-Cys) was prepared by treatment with 10 mm EGTA followed by desalting into 3 mmTris, pH 7.5, and 100 mm KCl. Samples used for titration contained 30 μm apo troponin C(A-Cys), 30 μm 5,5′-dibromoBAPTA, 3 mm Tris, pH 7.5, and 100 mm KCl. One ml of the protein solution without Ca2+ was titrated with 3 μl aliquots of the same solution made 2 mm in CaCl2, and absorbance was monitored at 264 nm. Under these conditions, the concentrations of BAPTA and protein did not change during the titration, and there was no dilution effect on absorbance. The experimental data were fit to a Ca2+ binding isotherm as described by Linse et al. (25Linse S. Helmersson A. Forsén S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8050-8054Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The basal Ca2+ in the buffer/proteins sample was determined to be 7 μm. NMR samples were analyzed by both gel filtration and HPLC chromatography to detect possible covalent binding of levosimendan to cTnC. Samples were run on a Bio-Gel P-6 column equilibrated in 20 mm Tris, 150 mmKCl, and 10 mm EDTA (pH 7.5) to remove free drug. Eluted protein was concentrated and stored in 6 m urea, 20 mm Tris, 150 mm KCl, and 10 mm EDTA (pH 8.0) overnight and then loaded onto a Bio-Gel P-6 column equilibrated in 3 m urea, 20 mm Tris-Cl, and 150 mm KCl (pH 7.5). These samples were analyzed by HPLC after exchanging the sample buffer by dialysis to remove the urea. The HPLC chromatographic system consisted of a Waters model 501 pump, a Waters model 680 automated gradient controller, and an Alltech MacrosphereTM GPC 60 7 μm (250 × 4.6 mm, length × inner diameter) HPLC column. A Waters LambdaTM model 481 liquid chromatography spectrophotometer was used to monitor the elution of levosimendan at 406 nm. The buffer consisted of 20 mm Tris and 150 mm KCl (pH 7.5). In addition, the samples were run on 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis urea gels. Using equilibrium dialysis and tyrosine fluorescence, Pan and Johnson (12Pan B.-S. Johnson Jr., R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 817-823Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) have shown that the thiadiazinone derivative EMD 57033 binds selectively to the C-terminal domain of cTnC (12Pan B.-S. Johnson Jr., R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 817-823Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). This contrasts with bepridil and TFP, which, as we (11Kleerekoper Q. Liu W. Choi D. Putkey J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8153-8160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) have shown, bind to both the N- and C-terminal domains of cTnC. To confirm the selectivity of EMD 57033 and as a further test of our methodology for detecting drug binding to cTnC, we determined the effect of EMD 57033 on the methionyl methyl chemical shifts of cTnC in the absence and presence of Ca2+. cTnC(A-Cys), which has both endogenous Cys residues converted to Ser and was chosen for these studies because the solution structure of this cTnC derivative is known (9Sia S.K. Li M.X. Spyracopoulos L. Gagne S.M. Liu W. Putkey J.A. Sykes B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18216-18221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar), and it has been used in previous drug binding studies (11Kleerekoper Q. Liu W. Choi D. Putkey J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8153-8160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Fig. 1 A shows that EMD 57033 did not bind to [methyl- 13C]Met-labeled cTnC(A-Cys) in the absence of Ca2+, as evidenced by the absence of drug-dependent changes in1H-13C HSQC spectra. In the presence of Ca2+ (Fig. 1 B), significant drug-induced changes in the positions of 1H-13C correlations were observed for Met157 and Met120 located in the C-terminal domain of cTnC. Drug-induced changes in the chemical shifts of Met157 and Met120 were maximal at a drug:protein ratio of 1:1. Chemical shifts for N-terminal Met residues were unaffected by EMD 50733, even at a 2:1 drug:protein ratio (data not shown). These data agree with the results Pan and Johnson (12Pan B.-S. Johnson Jr., R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 817-823Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) and demonstrate that EMD 57033 binds selectively to the C-terminal domain of cTnC in the presence of Ca2+. The data also validate the use of the Met methyl chemical shifts as location-specific markers to monitor the binding of structurally distinct drugs to cTnC. Initial experiments showed that Met methyl chemical shifts of [methyl- 13C]Met-labeled cTnC(A-Cys) were unaffected by an equimolar concentration of levosimendan in the presence or absence of Ca2+ (data not shown). Thus, the effects of higher concentrations of drug were determined. Fig.2 A shows that a 4-fold molar excess of levosimendan has generalized and minor effects on the methionyl methyl chemical shifts of cTnC(A-Cys) in the absence of Ca2+. In the presence of Ca2+ (Fig.2 B), only Met120 and Met157 exhibit significant chemical shift changes in the proton dimension upon the addition of 2-fold and 4-fold molar excesses of levosimendan. Observed changes for Met81 at high drug:protein ratios are restricted to the carbon dimension. However, the interpretation of these changes with respect to specific drug binding to cTnC must be made cautiously because they are observed only at drug:protein ratios of greater than 1:1. Binding of bepridil and TFP to cTnC(A-Cys) induced significant spectral changes at a drug:protein ratio of 0.5:1 (11Kleerekoper Q. Liu W. Choi D. Putkey J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8153-8160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Even the fluorescent dye 4,4′-dianilino-1,1′-binaphthyl-5,5′-disulfonic acid, which binds to hydrophobic surfaces, induces large changes in the HSQC spectra of [methyl- 13C]Met-labeled cTnC(A-Cys) (data not shown). We next used isotope-filtered NMR techniques in an attempt to identify NOEs between aromatic protons in levosimendan and Met methyl protons in cTnC(A-Cys) that was metabolically labeled with [methyl- 13C]Met and Phe-(D)8. No NOEs were detected (data not shown). In contrast, similar experiments identified strong NOEs between bepridil and cTnC(A-Cys) (11Kleerekoper Q. Liu W. Choi D. Putkey J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8153-8160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). cTnC(A-Cys) encodes Ser rather than Cys at positions 35 and 84. It is possible that these mutations affect the ability of levosimendan to bind to cTnC. To test this, we labeled cTnC3, which contains Cys35 and Cys84, with [methyl- 13C]Met and monitored Met methyl chemical shifts upon the addition of levosimendan in the presence of Ca2+ as shown in Fig. 3. The Met methyl chemical shifts for cTnC3 in the presence of Ca2+ are slightly different than those for cTnC(A-Cys) but are identical to those reported previously for cTnC3 (19Lin X. Krudy G.A. Howarth J. Brito R.M.M. Rosevear P.R. Putkey J.A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 14434-14442Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The addition of levosimendan to cTnC3 at a probe:protein ratio of 1.6:1 had no effect on the N-terminal Met residues. Similar to what was observed for cTnC(A-Cys), levosimendan had minor effects on the proton chemical shifts of Met120 (Δ0.01 ppm) and Met157(Δ0.02 ppm) in C-terminal domain. The results in Figs. 2 and 3 and the absence of NOEs between cTnC and levosimendan suggest either that the drug does not bind to cTnC or that it binds with very low affinity and preferentially to the C-terminal domain. Both of these interpretations are not consistent with the Ca2+-sensitizing effects of levosimendan, which is proposed to act via binding to cTnC (8Pollesello P. Ovaska M. Kaivola J. Tilgmann C. Lundström K. Kalkkinen N. Ulmanen I. Nissinen E. Taskinen J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28584-28590Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Haikala H. Kaivola J. Nissinen E. Wall P. Levijoki J. Linden I.B. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1995; 27: 1859-1866Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar) and to be effective at concentrations as low as 0.03–1 μmlevosimendan (26Edes I. Kiss E. Kitada Y. Powers F.M. Papp J.G. Kranias E.G. Solaro R.J. Circ. Res. 1995; 77: 107-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). An alternative explanation for the data is that levosimendan binds to cTnC but does not greatly affect the Met methyl chemical shifts. To address this, we used equilibrium dialysis to determine direct binding of levosimendan to Ca2+-saturated cTnC. The antianginal agent bepridil (27Gill A. Flaim S.F. Damiano B.P. Sit S.P. Brannan M.D. Am. J. Cardiol. 1992; 69: 11D-16DAbstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) was used as a positive control because it is known to bind to cTnC (7MacLachlan L.K. Reid D.G. Mitchell R.C. Salter C.J. Smith S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9764-9770Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Kleerekoper Q. Liu W. Choi D. Putkey J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8153-8160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Protein and drug concentrations were selected to ensure that even low affinity binding would be detected. Fig. 4 A shows the results of equilibrium dialysis to detect the binding of bepridil to cTnC(A-Cys). The absorbance spectrum clearly shows significant binding of bepridil to cTnC(A-Cys), as evidenced by an accumulation of drug in the chamber containing protein. The apparent dissociation constant for binding of bepridil to cTnC(A-Cys) was approximately 20 μm, which agrees well with values of 10–20 μm that were reported using NMR and fluorescence techniques (7MacLachlan L.K. Reid D.G. Mitchell R.C. Salter C.J. Smith S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9764-9770Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Solaro R.J. Bousquet P. Johnson J.D. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1986; 238: 502-507PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 4 B shows the results of equilibrium dialysis to detect the binding of levosimendan to cTnC. It is clear that levosimendan does not bind significantly to cTnC because chambers with and without protein contained equal concentrations of levosimendan. Equilibrium dialysis experiments performed at pH 7.5, pH 7.0, and pH 6.8 and at different ionic strengths all showed no evidence of binding levosimendan to cTnC. The potential effect of levosimendan on the Ca2+ binding affinity of cTnC was determined using Ca2+-sensitive dyes. Fig. 5shows the absorbance of 5,5′-dibromoBAPTA when titrated with Ca2+ in the presence of cTnC(A-Cys) and in the presence or absence of levosimendan. Binding of Ca2+ to 5,5′-dibromoBAPTA causes a decrease in absorbance at 262 nm. Competition between 5,5′-dibromoBAPTA and cTnC for binding Ca2+ allows determination of the capacity and macromolecular binding constants for Ca2+ binding sites in cTnC. The line represents a fit of experimental data in the absence of levosimendan using the method of Linse et al. (25Linse S. Helmersson A. Forsén S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8050-8054Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is clear from Fig. 5 that the presence of levosimendan had no effect on the Ca2+ binding properties of cTnC. The fractional change in absorbance was essentially identical for all level of Ca2+ in the presence and absence of levosimendan. Together, the data in Figs. Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4, Figure 5 demonstrate that levosimendan at concentrations of less than 1 mm does not bind to free Ca2+-bound cTnC. The modest chemical shift changes seen in Fig. 2 at high concentrations of levosimendan (4 mm) may be due to nonspecific or very weak binding. However, it is possible that levosimendan binds to cTnC only when it is bound to cTnI. To address this possibility, we monitored drug-induced chemical shift changes when cTnC(A-Cys) was bound to cTnI. For these experiments, we generated mouse cTnI(A-Cys)33–211 in which amino acids 1–33 were deleted and in which Cys81 and Cys98 were converted to Ser. A derivative of mouse cTnI in which the first 33 amino acids had been deleted was shown previously by Guo et al. (17Guo X. Wattanapermpool J. Palmiter K.A. Murphy A.M. Solaro R.J. J. Biol.

We elected to convert both Cys residues to Ser to prevent formation of intramolecular disulfide bonds in native cTnI. 2Q. Kleerekoper and J. A. Putkey, unpublished observations. A derivative of cTnI in which both Cys residues were converted to Ser was shown to be functional (31Dong W.J. Chandra M. Xing J. Solaro R.J. Cheung H.C.

Table I lists the chemical shifts for the 10 methionyl methyl 1H-13C correlations cTnC(A-Cys) when free and when associated with cTnI(A-Cys)33–211. All Met methyl chemical shifts in the C-terminal domain of cTnC(A-Cys), except Met137, were significantly affected by cTnI(A-Cys)33–211. The absolute chemical shift values for Met residues in the C-terminal domain of cTnC(A-Cys) in the presence or absence of cTnI(A-Cys)33–211 are in excellent agreement with those of Krudy et al.

Hamamatsu M. Yamamoto N. Motai H. Hayashi K. Food Chem. 1983; 11: 187-200Crossref Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 9Ichishima E. Hanzawa S. Watanabe M. Takeuchi M. Curr. Microbiol. 1986; 13: 231-235Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar) on the hydrolysis and liquefaction of soybean protein. Neutral proteinase II is now designated as deuterolysin (EC 3.4.24.39) according to the Enzyme Nomenclature Commission (10NC-IUBMB Webb E.C. Enzyme Nomenclature 1992. Academic Press, Inc., Orlando, FL1992Google Scholar). The metalloproteinases (neutral proteinases I and II) from A. sojae were characterized by Sekine (11Sekine H. Agric. Biol.

Chem. 1976; 40: 29-31Crossref Google Scholar). Neutral proteinase I contains 1 g atom of zinc and 2 g atoms of calcium per mol of enzyme, and the zinc is essential for activity (13Sekine H. Agric. Biol. Chem. 1972; 36: 2143-2150Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Neutral proteinase I with a molecular mass of 41,700 Da has enzymatic properties similar to those of the neutral proteinase from Bacillus thermoproteolyticus, thermolysin (EC 3.4.24.27) (15Sekine H. Agric. Biol. Chem. 1976; 40: 29-31Crossref Google Scholar). In the digestion of the oxidized insulin B-chain with neutral proteinase I, the cleavage sites produced by the enzyme are very similar to those of the other neutral proteinases. Deuterolysin from A. sojae possesses a preference for basic proteins as substrates, showing high activities on the basic nuclear proteins histone, protamine, and salmine, but very low activities on milk casein, hemoglobin, albumin, and gelatin (12Sekine H. Agric. Biol. Chem. 1972; 36: 207-216Crossref Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 14Sekine H. Agric. Biol. Chem. 1973; 37: 1765-1767Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Deuterolysin is extremely stable at 100 °C, but relatively unstable around 75 °C (16Tatsumi H. Ikegawa K. Murakami S. Kawabe H. Nakano E. Motai H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1208: 179-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Elucidation of the thermal stability at 100 °C of the deuterolysin from A. oryzae has also been reported and discussed. It contains 1 g atom of zinc and 2 g atoms of calcium per mol with a molecular mass of 19,800 Da (13Sekine H. Agric. Biol. Chem. 1972; 36: 2143-2150Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar) and includes three disulfide bonds (16Tatsumi H. Ikegawa K. Murakami S. Kawabe H. Nakano E. Motai H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1208: 179-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The cloning and expression in yeast cells of a cDNA clone (S53810) encoding deuterolysin from A. oryzae were reported by Tatsumi et al. (17Tatsumi H. Murakami S. Tsuji R.F. Ishida Y. Murakami K. Masaki A. Kawabe A. Arimura H. Nakano K. Motai H. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1991; 228: 97-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The elucidation of substrate specificity with an oxidized insulin B-chain (18Ichishima E. Yamaguchi M. Yano H. Yamagata Y. Hirano K. Agric. Biol. Chem. 1991; 55: 2191-2193PubMed Google Scholar) and bioactive oligopeptides (19Yamaguchi M. Hanzawa S. Hirano K. Yamagata Y. Ichishima E. Phytochemistry (Oxf.). 1993; 33: 1317-1321Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) led to the discovery of penicillolysin as an enzyme thought to be a new 18-kDa metalloendopeptidase from Penicillium citrinum, having a distinct mode of action and a specificity unique from those of other metalloendopeptidases (2Vallee B.L. Auld D.S. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 5647-5659Crossref PubMed Scopus (1501) Google Scholar, 3Hooper N.M. FEBS Lett. 1994; 354: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar, 20Gripon J.C. Auberger B.

Penicillolysin also possesses a preference for basic proteins as substrates, showing high activities on basic nuclear proteins such as histone, protamine, and salmine, but very low activities on milk casein, hemoglobin, albumin, and gelatin (19Yamaguchi M. Hanzawa S. Hirano K. Yamagata Y. Ichishima E. Phytochemistry (Oxf.). 1993; 33: 1317-1321Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar); however, the enzyme has no heat stability above 60 °C. Penicillolysin contains 1 g atom of zinc/mol of enzyme and three disulfide bonds. The enzyme is a single-chain protein of 177 amino acid residues with a molecular mass of 18,529 Da and pI 9.6. Cloning of a cDNA clone (D25535) encoding penicillolysin from P. citrinum was carried out by Matsumoto et al. (23Matsumoto K. Yamaguchi M. Ichishima E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1218: 469-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Penicillolysin shows 68% sequence identity to deuterolysin from A. oryzae. We previously assumed that His128, His132, and Glu65 of penicillolysin (23Matsumoto K. Yamaguchi M. Ichishima E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1218: 469-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) corresponded to zinc ligands in thermolysin (24Mathews B.W. Jansonius J.N. Colman P.M. Schoenborn B.P. Dupourque D. Nat. New Biol. 1972; 238: 37-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar) and the neutral proteinases (2Vallee B.L. Auld D.S. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 5647-5659Crossref PubMed Scopus (1501) Google Scholar, 3Hooper N.M. FEBS Lett. 1994; 354: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar). In this paper, the possibility of a zinc-binding role for Glu65 in deuterolysin was ruled out because the mutant E65Q still had catalytic activity. The predicted amino acid sequence, including aspartic acid and glutamic acid, of deuterolysin (17Tatsumi H. Murakami S. Tsuji R.F. Ishida Y. Murakami K. Masaki A. Kawabe A. Arimura H. Nakano K. Motai H. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1991; 228: 97-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) has strong similarity to other members of the deuterolysin family: MEP20 from Aspergillus flavus (25Monod M. Paris S. Sangland D. Jaton-Ogay K. Bill J. Latge J.P. Infect. Immun. 1993; 61: 4099-4104Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and Aspergillus fumigatus (26Rhodes J. Amlung J.W. Miller M.S. Infect. Immun. 1990; 58: 2529-2534Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), metalloendopeptidases from Grifola frondosa and Pleurotus ostreatus (27Nonaka T. Dohmae N. Hashimoto Y. Takio K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30032-30039Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), and penicillolysin (23Matsumoto K. Yamaguchi M. Ichishima E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1218: 469-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). This finding may indicate that enzymes in the deuterolysin family are coded for by evolutionarily related genes at the enzymatic level. We hypothesized that Asp143 or Asp164 in the highly conserved region of the C terminus may be the third ligand of deuterolysin. We describe here site-directed mutagenesis studies of deuterolysin from A. oryzae for active-site determination. We found a new zinc-binding motif, aspzincin, defined as the “HE XX H + D” motif with an aspartic acid as the third zinc ligand. Restriction endonucleases, T4 DNA polymerase, alkaline phosphatase, and Taq DNA polymerase were purchased from Takara Shuzo (Kyoto, Japan). T4 DNA ligase and poly(A)+-reverse transcriptase RNase H−-polymerase were from Life Technologies, Inc. T4 polynucleotide kinase was from Nippon Gene (Tokyo, Japan). Protamine sulfate was from Sigma. Antifoam DB110N was purchased from Nacalai Tesque (Kyoto), as was isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. A. oryzae IFO 4251 was used as a source of native deuterolysin and mRNA because we could not obtain the strain (A. oryzae ATCC 20386) used in previous work (17Tatsumi H. Murakami S. Tsuji R.F. Ishida Y. Murakami K. Masaki A. Kawabe A. Arimura H. Nakano K. Motai H. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1991; 228: 97-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Escherichia coli DH5α (supE44 ΔlacU169 (ϕ 80 lacZΔ M15) hsdR17 recA1 endA1 gyrA96 thi-1 relA1) was used for plasmid isolation and cloning. E. coli TG1 (supE hsdΔ 5 thi Δ (lac-proAB)/F′[traD36 proAB + lacI q lacDΔ M15]) was used to propagate bacteriophage M13 vectors. E. coli BL21(DE3) (F− ompT hsdS b (r b− m b−)gal (l cI 857 ind1 Sam7 nin5 lac UV-T7 gene1)dcm (DE3)) was the host strain for protein expression. Plasmids pUC119, M13mp18, and pET32a were purchased from Takara Shuzo.E. coli cells were grown in LB medium (1% Bacto-Tryptone, 1% Bacto yeast extract, and 1% NaCl), and 50 μg/ml ampicillin was added when necessary. A. oryzae IFO 4251 was cultured in 50 ml of wheat bran medium (1.5% defatted soybean peptone, 1% potassium phosphate, and 0.02% zinc chloride dissolved in wheat bran extract, pH 6.8, at 37 °C for 80 h), and the culture was centrifuged to obtain 2 g of wet cells. Total RNA was isolated and purified by the method of Chomczynski and Sacchi (28Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (62909) Google Scholar). Poly(A)+ RNA was isolated using an Oligotex-dT30 (Takara Shuzo). A. oryzae single-stranded cDNA (dlnO) was synthesized from poly(A)+RNA using oligo(dT)12–18 primer and SuperScript RNase H reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.), following the manufacturer's instructions. Double-stranded cDNA was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (29Kawasaki E.S. Innis M.A. Gelfand D.H. Sninski J.T. White T.J. PCR Protocols. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego, CA1990: 21-27Crossref Google Scholar) using the following primers designed for adapting the Bam HI site: 5′-TTTCGGATCCGCCAGAATGCGTGTCACTACT-3′ (sense) and 5′-GAGGGATCCTTCACATTTAGCACTTGAGCTC-3′ (antisense), based on the cDNA sequence of deuterolysin from A. oryzae reported by Tatsumi et al. (17Tatsumi H. Murakami S. Tsuji R.F. Ishida Y. Murakami K. Masaki A. Kawabe A. Arimura H. Nakano K. Motai H. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1991; 228: 97-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The underlined letters in the sequences are the Bam HI sites. The synthesized cDNA was subcloned into pUC119 and sequenced to confirm the absence of any undesired mutation. The amino acid sequence of deuterolysin from A. oryzae IFO 4251 was identical to that (cDNA of neutral proteinase II) reported by Tatsumi et al. (17Tatsumi H. Murakami S. Tsuji R.F. Ishida Y. Murakami K. Masaki A. Kawabe A. Arimura H. Nakano K. Motai H. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1991; 228: 97-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) except for the substitution of three codons. The different codons were CTC (for nucleotides 48–50; Leu for amino acid 6 in the preregion) replaced by ATC (Ile), ACT (for nucleotides 72–74; Thr for amino acid 14 in the preregion) replaced by GCT (Ala), and CTT (for nucleotides 894–896; Leu for amino acid 113 in the mature region) replaced by TTG (Leu). There was no remarkable change in the amino acid sequences of the two mature enzymes deduced. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed by the method of Kunkel et al. (30Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4540) Google Scholar). The Eco RI-Bam HI fragment containing deuterolysin cDNA from pUCDLN(EB) was subcloned into M13mp18 to serve as a template for mutagenesis. The following mutagenic primers were used: E42Q, 5′-GTCTTGAAGTAtTgCTCGAACTTG-3′; R58Q, 5′-GCGCGCAGctGTTCAGCAAC-3′; E65Q, 5′-GTAGAGCCcGCTTgCTTAGCGAC-3′;E65Q, 5′-GTAGAGCCcGCTTgCTTAGCGAC-3′; D80N, 5′-CAGTAGCCaTAtGGGTtGTTGCAGTG-3′; E86Q, 5′-GTGTAGGCtAGcACGTTAGGCTgACAGTAGCC-3′; D104N, 5′-GTAGTAGATGTtGCAGTTcGCGATCTCG-3′; Y106F, 5′-GCTCAGAGTAGaAGATaTCGCAGTTGG-3′; H118A, 5′-GTCCTGGGCtgcGCACTTCTGAGCtAAGGGAGG-3′; D121N, 5′-GTGGCCTGGTtCTGcGCaTGGCACTTC-3′; H128R, 5′-GTGAGTGAAtTCGcGAAGAGTGG-3′; E129D, 5′-GTAGACGCCcGGGGCGTGAGTGAAgTCGTGAAGAG-3′; E129Q, 5′-GTAGACGCCcGGGGCGTGAGTGAACTgGTGAAGAGTG-3′; H132R, 5′-GCCAGGGGCGcGAGTGAAtTCGTGAAGA-3′; E142Q, 5′-CCCAAGTCCTgAGTcCCgGGCTGGTAG-3′; D143E, 5′-GTAGCCCAAcTCCTCgGTACCAGG-3′; D143N, 5′-GCCCAAGTtCTCgGTACCAGGC-3′; and D164N, 5′-CATAGGAATtcGCGTTGTTC-3′. All the mutagenic primers were designed to be antisense. Mismatches with the original sequence of dlnO are indicated in lowercase letters. The mutation was verified by DNA sequencing before subcloning the gene into the expression vector pETDLN. The expression plasmid for prodeuterolysin, pETDLN, was constructed by inserting the deuterolysin cDNA fragment with the T7 promoter/lac operator and T7 terminator and thioredoxin fusion gene (31LaVallie E.R. DiBlasio E.A. McCoy J.M. Bio/Technology. 1993; 11: 187-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (819) Google Scholar) into pET32a (Novagen). The cDNA was modified by polymerase chain reaction to remove the signal sequence and to introduce a start codon at the N terminus of prodeuterolysin. The sense primer 5′-TTGaaTTCCACCGCTGccatgGCGCCAACCGCT-3′ and antisense primer 5′-GAGGgATCcTTCACATTTAGCACTTGAGCTC-3′ introduced Eco RI, Nco I, and Bam HI sites at the 5′-end, N terminus, and 3′-end, respectively. Mutation sites with the original sequence of dlnO are indicated in lowercase letters. A Met start codon was created by the Nco I site at the N terminus of prodeuterolysin. The amplified 1.0-kilobase pair cDNA fragment was digested with Eco RI and Bam HI and cloned into pUC119 to generate pUCDLN(EB). The amplified cDNA was confirmed to lack the undesired mutation by sequencing. The Nco I-Bam HI fragment from the pUCDLN(EB) was subcloned into the pET32a vector to generate pETDLN (Fig.1). E. coli BL21(DE3) cells transformed with pETDLN were cultured at 37 °C in a 5-liter jar fermentor containing 2 liters of 4-fold concentrated LB medium containing 50 mg/ml ampicillin, 10 mm calcium chloride, and 0.25% (v/v) antifoam DB110N emulsion until A600 nm reached 7; then isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 1 mm, and incubation was continued for 3 h (aeration and agitation rate was 3 liters/min and 300 rpm, respectively). The cells were harvested by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 20 min, resuspended in 200 ml of 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, and frozen at −80 °C. Part of the frozen cells were melted and ruptured by sonication. The cell homogenate was centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was recentrifuged, and the resulting supernatant was used as crude prodeuterolysin preparation. The crude proenzyme solution was loaded on a RESOURCE Q column (0.64 × 3 cm, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and eluted with 5 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, with a linear gradient of 0–0.5 m NaCl. The fractions containing prodeuterolysin were pooled. The pooled fraction was loaded on a HiLoad Superdex 75 column (1.6 × 60 cm, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and eluted with 5 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, containing 0.3 m NaCl. The fractions containing prodeuterolysin were dialyzed against 5 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, and used as a purified prodeuterolysin preparation. The purified proenzyme fraction was incubated at 37 °C for 30 min with an equal amount of trypsin (mol/mol, Merck). After the addition ofl-1-chloro-3-(4-tosylamido)-7-amino-2-heptanone hydrochloride at 100 μm as a trypsin inhibitor, the reaction mixture was loaded on a HiLoad 16/60 Superdex 75 column (1.6 × 60 cm, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and eluted with 5 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, containing 0.3m NaCl. The fractions containing deuterolysin were pooled. After dialysis against 5 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, the pooled fraction was loaded on two HiTrap Q anion-exchange columns (0.77 × 2.5 cm, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and eluted with 5 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, with a linear gradient of 0–0.5 m NaCl. The fractions containing activated deuterolysin were pooled. Maturation from prodeuterolysin to active deuterolysin was also observed with the addition of 5 mmZn2+. Proteolytic activities with salmon protamine sulfate (salmine) were assayed at pH 7.0 and 30 °C. Fifty μl of sample and 400 μl of 100 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, were mixed and preincubated for 5 min, and then 150 μl of 2% (w/v) salmon protamine sulfate (previously denatured at 100 °C for 30 min in 100 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0) was added and incubated for various periods. Six-hundred ml of 12.5% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid with 20% (w/v) NaCl was added to stop the reaction, and the mixture was then filtered with Advantec No. 2 filter paper. Two-hundred μl of the filtrate and 3.0 ml of 0.5 m sodium citrate buffer, pH 5.0, were added to the reaction mixture; 1 ml of freshly prepared ninhydrin reagent (19Yamaguchi M. Hanzawa S. Hirano K. Yamagata Y. Ichishima E. Phytochemistry (Oxf.). 1993; 33: 1317-1321Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) was also added. The linearity of the assay was checked, and the amount of amino acid produced in the reaction mixture was determined. One katal is defined as the amount of enzyme yielding the color equivalent of 1 mol of tyrosine/s with ninhydrin reagent using protein substrates at pH 7.0 and 30 °C according to previous work (19Yamaguchi M. Hanzawa S. Hirano K. Yamagata Y. Ichishima E. Phytochemistry (Oxf.). 1993; 33: 1317-1321Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Protein concentration was determined using the BCA protein assay reagent (Pierce) following the manufacturer's instructions. A set of protein standards of known concentration was prepared by diluting the bovine serum albumin standard solution provided with this kit. Ten μl of each standard or unknown protein sample was pipetted into the tube, and then 200 μl of working reagent was added to each tube and mixed well. All tubes were incubated at 60 °C for 30 min and cooled to room temperature, and the absorbance at 562 nm was measured. Protein samples were loaded onto a RESOURCE RPC column (0.64 × 3 cm, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and eluted with 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid with a linear gradient of 0–80% (v/v) acetonitrile. The peak fractions were concentrated with a TAITEC VA-500F Speed Vac and then subjected to N-terminal sequence determination on an Applied Biosystems 473A protein sequencer with a 610A data analysis system. SDS-PAGE supernatants (0.5 ml) of the E. coli transformants with wild-type and mutant dlnO genes were treated with trichloroacetic acid and centrifuged. The pellets were dissolved in 100 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 8.0, containing 0.01% SDS, heated, and denatured. The proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE as described by Laemmli (32Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar) and then stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 dissolved in 50% methanol and 9.5% acetic acid and destained in 5% methanol and 9.5% acetic acid. Samples were dialyzed in 5 mmphosphate buffer, pH 7.0, and then diluted in the same buffer to 0.2 mg of protein/ml by adjusting A280 nm at 0.2. The CD measurements were done as described by Yamaguchi et al. (19Yamaguchi M. Hanzawa S. Hirano K. Yamagata Y. Ichishima E. Phytochemistry (Oxf.). 1993; 33: 1317-1321Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) using a Jasco J-700 spectrophotometer. The contents of α-helix and β-structure of the enzyme were calculated by the SSE-338 program described by Yang et al. (33Yang J.T. Wu C.S. Martinez H.M. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 130: 208-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (1722) Google Scholar). The molecular mass value of 19,800 Da was used. The zinc blotting (34Schiff L.A. Nibert M.L. Field B.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 4195-4199Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) for the 65Zn binding ability assay was performed on SDS-polyacrylamide gel for the site-directed mutant enzymes H128R, E129Q, H132R, D143N, and D164N. SDS-PAGE was performed according to the protocol described by Laemmli (32Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar). Proteins were electrophoretically transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane by the protein blotting technique, after which the filter was washed in metal-binding buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, containing 50 mm NaCl) for 3 h. The filter was probed for 1 h with 5 μCi of65ZnCl2/lane (2.71 μCi/g; 1 Ci = 37 GBq; NEN Life Science Products) in 15–20 ml of metal-binding buffer. It was then washed in Saran Wrap and exposed to an imaging plate (Fuji Photo Film Co., Tokyo) for 12 h. After exposure, the imaging plate was analyzed by a BioImage BAS-2000 Analyzer System (Fuji Photo Film Co.). Proteins immobilized on the polyvinylidene difluoride membrane were detected by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 (0.05% in 50% methanol and 10% acetic acid); the protein staining was done in duplicate. Zinc analysis in the enzyme was also done by atomic absorption spectrophotometry using a Perkin-Elmer Model 3100 apparatus. Molecular mass determination of the recombinant wild-type deuterolysins activated with Zn2+ and trypsin was done by gel filtration with a Superdex 75 HR 10/30 column. The elution time of proteins through the column was plotted against logarithms of a molecular mass of standard proteins. Bovine serum albumin (67 kDa), ovalbumin (43 kDa), and myoglobin (17.4 kDa) were used as molecular mass standards. Recombinant wild-type prodeuterolysin was expressed in E. coli and purified as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The purified prodeuterolysin could be activated by 5 mm ZnCl2 at 4 °C for 24 h. A high yield of the mature deuterolysin was obtained by the activation method with ZnCl2; however, the method required a lengthy incubation time. A more effective method of activating the purified proenzyme fractions was by incubation at 37 °C for 30 min with an equal amount of trypsin (mol/mol), although the yield of the activation method with trypsin was lower than that of the method with ZnCl2. We obtained homogeneous preparations on SDS-PAGE of deuterolysin activated with ZnCl2 and trypsin, as shown in Fig.2. The molecular mass of the recombinant deuterolysin activated by ZnCl2 was determined as 19,800 Da by gel filtration on Superdex 75 HR 10/30 (data not shown), which was similar to that of the native enzyme (19,000 Da) reported by Tatsumi et al. (17Tatsumi H. Murakami S. Tsuji R.F. Ishida Y. Murakami K. Masaki A. Kawabe A. Arimura H. Nakano K. Motai H. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1991; 228: 97-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The specific activity of deuterolysin activated by trypsin treatment was 0.144 katal/kg of protein with salmine as a substrate, and this was also the same specific activity as that of the native enzyme purified from A. oryzae. Activity resistance to 100 °C treatment with Zn2+ and inhibition with EDTA showed that the recombinant deuterolysin expressed in E. coli was similar to native deuterolysin. The N-terminal sequence of recombinant wild-type deuterolysin activated with an equal amount (mol/mol) of trypsin was found to be Thr-Glu-Val-Thr-Asp, which is the N-terminal sequence of deuterolysin from A. oryzae (17Tatsumi H. Murakami S. Tsuji R.F. Ishida Y. Murakami K. Masaki A. Kawabe A. Arimura H. Nakano K. Motai H. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1991; 228: 97-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), as shown in TableI. The result suggests that catalytic cleavage of the peptide bond Arg−1–Thr1 in prodeuterolysin by trypsin may occur. The N-terminal sequence of the recombinant wild-type enzyme activated with 5 mmZnCl2 for 24 h at 4 °C, in contrast, was found to be Glu-Val-Thr-Asp, which was one amino acid residue shorter than that of native deuterolysin from A. oryzae. These results suggest that autocatalytic cleavage of the propeptide may occur ahead of threonine and that the product is trimmed by aminopeptidase(s) in bacterial culture broth. The ultraviolet CD spectrum of recombinant wild-type deuterolysin activated by trypsin predicted a conformation of 70% α-helix, 16% β-structure, and 14% random structure, which was almost identical to that of the native enzyme (71% α-helix and 29% β-structure).Table IComparison of N-terminal sequences and estimated secondary structures by CD determination of native, wild-type, and site-directed mutant deuterolysins expressed in E. coliEnzymeN-terminal sequenceSecondary structureα-Helixβ-Structureβ-TurnRandom coilNativeTEVTD710290Wild-type (Zn2+) EVTD7001713Wild-type (trypsin)TEVTD7001614H128RTEVTD6301720E129QTEVTD7101712H132RTEVTD700273D143NTEVTD6801913D164NTEVTD750223 Open table in a new tab Several specific mutations were introduced by site-directed mutagenesis into the predicted active sites and substrate-binding regions of deuterolysin.

In this work, binding site selection allowed us to identify the 21-base pair ATTACCCATAATGCATYGCGG sequence as the high affinity consensus binding site for Staf. It shows a high sequence divergence with Staf-responsive elements in the Xenopus selenocysteine tRNA (tRNASec) and human U6 snRNA promoters. By using a combination of approaches, we analyzed the interaction of wild-type and truncated Staf zinc finger domains with the consensus, Xenopus tRNASec, and human U6 sites. Two main conclusions emerged from our data. First, the data clearly indicate that zinc finger 7 does not establish base-specific contacts in Staf-DNA complexes. The second conclusion concerns zinc finger 1, which is required for the binding to the Xenopus tRNASec site but is dispensable in the case of the human U6 site. Taking into account the sequence differences in the two sites, these findings demonstrate that Staf utilizes zinc finger 1 in a rather flexible manner, illustrating how a protein can interact with DNAs containing targets of different sequences.

A common feature of many activating proteins is that DNA binding and activation functions reside in different domains of the protein. The majority of sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins can be classified according to the presence of conserved domains, such as helix-turn-helix, zinc finger, or leucine zipper (for reviews, see Refs. 1Pabo C.O. Sauer R.T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 1053-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (1231) Google Scholar and 2Patikoglou G. Burley S.K. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1997; 26: 289-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Recently, we have demonstrated that the zinc finger protein Staf, originally identified in Xenopus laevis as the transcriptional activator of the tRNASec 1 gene (3Myslinski E. Krol A. Carbon P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 203-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 4Schuster C. Myslinski E. Krol A. Carbon P. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3777-3787Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), is also involved in transcriptional activation of snRNA and snRNA-type genes, some of which are transcribed by RNA polymerase II and others by RNA polymerase III (5Schaub M. Myslinski E. Schuster C. Krol A. Carbon P. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 173-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). In addition, Staf possesses the capacity to stimulate expression from an RNA polymerase II mRNA promoter. The presence of two physically and functionally distinct activation domains, one specifically activating snRNA-type promoters and the other mRNA promoters, constitutes the molecular basis for this dichotomous transcriptional activity (6Schuster C. Krol A. Carbon P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2650-2658Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In human cells, ZNF76 and ZNF143 are two human homologs of Staf. ZNF143 is the ortholog, whereas ZNF76 is a DNA-binding protein related to Staf and ZNF143 (7Myslinski E. Krol A. Carbon P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21998-22006Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). In its central part, Staf contains seven contiguous zinc fingers of the C2-H2 type (2Patikoglou G. Burley S.K. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1997; 26: 289-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 8Miller J. McLachlan A.D. Klug A. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 1609-1614Crossref PubMed Scopus (1705) Google Scholar). The first six are of the C X4C X3(F/Y)X5L X2H X3H type (X stands for any amino acid), except that the leucine residue is not found in the fourth and fifth fingers, where it is replaced by arginine and tyrosine residues, respectively. The seventh zinc finger, however, is of the C X2C X3Y X5L X2H X4H type. The sequence linking the last histidine of one zinc finger to the first cysteine of the next one is highly conserved, giving rise to the consensus TG(E/D)(K/R)PYN, but the (E/D)(K/R) sequence is not found between the sixth and seventh finger. Comparative DNase I footprinting analysis performed either with the entire protein or with the zinc finger domain only established that the seven tandemly repeated zinc fingers contain the DNA binding domain of Staf (4Schuster C. Myslinski E. Krol A. Carbon P. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3777-3787Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Structural analysis of DNA-zinc finger complexes has demonstrated that each interacting zinc finger contacts 3–5 bp of DNA (9Pavletich N.P. Pabo C.O.

A. 1998; 95: 2938-2943Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Assuming that all of the seven Staf zinc fingers would contact the DNA, the protein should recognize a binding site composed of at least 21 bp. However, sequence comparisons of known Staf binding sites with the consensus sequence derived from binding site selection revealed a high degree of sequence divergence. This is well illustrated by the Staf-responsive elements that lack the 5′ part of the consensus sequence in the Xenopus tRNASec and the 3′ part in the human U6 promoters (5Schaub M. Myslinski E. Schuster C. Krol A. Carbon P. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 173-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). To elucidate the mechanism by which Staf can recognize divergent DNA sequences, we have assayed the relative contributions of individual zinc fingers, and sets of zinc fingers, to the binding to an optimal site and Staf-responsive elements that are sequence divergent. In this study, determinations of the relative binding affinities of Staf and recombinant zinc finger polypeptides to the optimal site, Xenopus tRNASec, and human U6 Staf-responsive elements were performed, in combination with DNase I footprinting, missing nucleoside assays, and binding site selection. This revealed that zinc finger 7 does not establish base-specific contacts with the DNA and that zinc finger 1 is utilized by Staf in a flexible manner depending on the target site with which it interacts. pSK(−)-Staf corresponds to M2 cDNA in pSK(−) (4Schuster C. Myslinski E. Krol A. Carbon P. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3777-3787Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). pSK(−)-Staf-Zf 1–7 was made by cloning, into the Sac I and Eco RI sites of pSK(−), the Staf zinc finger domain (amino acids 249–475) prepared by PCR amplification of pSK(−)-Staf using 5′ and 3′ primers complementary to positions 772–788 and 1436–1452 of the Staf nontemplate region, respectively. The 3′ primer contains a UAG stop codon. The pBS(+)-optimal Staf binding site was made by cloning into the Bam HI of pBS(+), a DNA fragment containing the optimal Staf binding site. The monomeric sequence of the optimal site is GATCCATTGTTATGGATTTACCCACAATGCATTGCGCCCGTGTATG. The wild-type and truncated Staf zinc finger domains were produced using the glutathione S-transferase (GST) gene fusion system. Plasmids pGST-Zf 1–7, pGST-Zf 1–6, pGST-Zf 1–5, and pGST-Zf 2–7 were obtained by insertion, into the Bam HI and Eco RI sites of pGEX-3X (17Smith D.B. Johnson K.S. Gene. 1988; 67: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (5047) Google Scholar), of the zinc finger cDNAs containing amino acids 257–475, 257–446, 257–411, and 294–475, respectively (4Schuster C. Myslinski E. Krol A. Carbon P. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3777-3787Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The bacterial culture in LB medium and isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside induction of the wild-type and truncated zinc finger domains fused to GST were performed at 25 °C. The fusion proteins were purified, using glutathione-Sepharose beads, essentially as described in Ref. 17Smith D.B. Johnson K.S. Gene. 1988; 67: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (5047) Google Scholar. Protein concentrations were determined using the Bradford microassay (Bio-Rad) with bovine serum albumin as a standard. Binding site selection was performed essentially as described in Ref. 5Schaub M. Myslinski E. Schuster C. Krol A. Carbon P. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 173-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar with the following minor modifications. Six cycles of binding and amplification by PCR were performed with decreasing protein concentrations for the fourth, fifth, and sixth cycles to enhance specificity. DNase I footprinting assays were performed essentially as described in Ref. 4Schuster C. Myslinski E. Krol A. Carbon P. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3777-3787Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar. Hydroxyl radical cleavage reactions were carried out as described by Hayes and Tullius (18Hayes J.H. Tullius T.D. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 9521-9527Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), with minor modifications. 60 fmol of labeled DNA fragments (0.4 × 106 dpm) were added to a final volume of 20 μl of H2O. Three μl of cleavage solution (0.76 mmFe (NH4)2(SO4)2·6 H2O, 1.52 mm EDTA, 0.023% H2O2, 7.6 mm ascorbic acid) were then added. After 2 min at room temperature, 3 μl of glycerol were added to stop the reaction. The DNA was ethanol-precipitated and resuspended in 2 μl of TE buffer. The gel retardation assays were performed, in a total volume of 10 μl, in the presence of the premodified DNA fragments (0.4 × 106 dpm) and the amount of protein required to retard approximately 50% of the probe. The buffer conditions used were as follows: 10 mmHEPES-NaOH, pH 7.5, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mmMgCl2, 50 mm KCl, 5% glycerol, 20 μm ZnCl2, 0.1% Nonidet P-40. Samples were incubated for 30 min at room temperature and loaded directly onto a native 4% polyacrylamide gel (mono:bis, 19.3:0.7) containing 0.25× Tris-borate-EDTA. Free and bound probes were eluted from the gel and analyzed in a 10% polyacrylamide-urea sequencing gel, alongside a Maxam and Gilbert G+A reaction of the relevant probe, used as markers. The probes were prepared as follows. The nontemplate and template strands of human U6 (positions −357 to −171) and Xenopus tRNASec (positions −280 to −102) were 5′-end-labeled by PCR amplification of the corresponding genes using distal and proximal 5′-end 32P-labeled primers, respectively. The nontemplate and template strands of the optimal probe (94 bp) were 5′-end-labeled by PCR amplification of the plasmid pBS(+)-optimal Staf binding site, using distal and proximal 5′-end 32P-labeled primers. The distal and proximal primers were complementary to positions 911–931 and 880–900 of pBS(+), respectively. Quantitative competitive gel shift assays were used to compare the relative affinities of the binding sites. In these experiments, the protein was incubated for 20 min at room temperature with zero and increasing concentrations of the unlabeled binding site oligonucleotide duplex as the competitor. The labeled optimal probe (20 fmol) was then added to a final volume of 10 μl, with continued incubation for 50 min at room temperature to establish the new equilibrium. The proteins used in these assays were synthesized by in vitro coupled transcription-translation with the TnT system (Promega). Reactions were programmed with the pSK(−)-Staf and pSK(−)-Staf-Zf 1–7 constructs. 1.5 and 5 μl of the programmed lysate were used for the experiments described in the legend to Fig. 2, B and C, respectively. Following electrophoresis, the bound probe was quantitated, and the fraction of maximal binding at each competitor concentration was calculated as the ratio of bound probe plus competitor to bound probe with no competitor. A curve was then fitted to the values for the fraction of maximal binding at known competitor DNA concentrations. The IC50 was defined as the concentration of competitor DNA inhibiting 50% of binding. For the measurement of the apparent dissociation constants (Kd values), a series of 10-μl gel retardation reactions was prepared using a fixed concentration of purified wild-type or truncated Staf zinc finger domain fused to glutathione S-transferase (0.15 nm of Zf 1–7, 1 nm of Zf 1–6, and 1.5 nm of Zf 2–7), and variable concentrations of 5′-end labeled probes (0.1–26 nm). After the binding reaction reached the equilibrium (50 min at room temperature), the bound and free probes were separated by electrophoresis through a 4% native gel. The concentrations of the labeled probes contained in the bound and free DNAs were determined with reference to standard probes run on the same gel and quantitated with a Fuji BAS 2000 bioimage analyzer. The mass action equation (Kd = [DNA] [P]/[DNA.P]) can be rearranged in terms of total protein concentration (Po) to a form similar to that of the Michaelis-Menten equation: [DNA·P] = [Po] [DNA]/[DNA] +Kd. Data were analyzed as a plot of bound DNA versus free DNA using the Kaleidagraph software, from which Kd values were derived. Our previous studies, using binding site selection, identified the 19-bp sequence YY(A/T)CCC(A/G)N(A/C)AT(G/C)C(A/C)YYRCR as the consensus for recognition of the zinc finger domain of Staf (5Schaub M. Myslinski E. Schuster C. Krol A. Carbon P. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 173-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Within this sequence, position 8 is fully degenerate, and positions 4–6, 10, 11, and 13 are more highly constrained than bases at positions 1–3, 7, 9, 12, and 14–19. In order to identify the base preferences for the 12 degenerate positions, chimeric proteins consisting of glutathione S-transferase fused to the Staf zinc finger domain were used in a new binding site selection experiment from a 57-bp oligonucleotide duplex containing an internal core of 17 random nucleotides. Six cycles of binding were performed with decreasing protein concentrations for the fourth, fifth, and sixth cycles to enhance specificity. 123 independent clones were sequenced. Of the 23 positions tabulated, 21 displayed a very significant higher constraint with respect to base preference (Fig. 1). Compared with the consensus identified in our earlier work, the newly derived 21-bp consensus sequence ATTACCCATAATGCATYGCGG is extended by an A residue on the 5′ side (position 1) and a G residue on the 3′ side (position 21). The information that could be extracted from this experiment is as follows. A very high constraint is observed for Cs at positions 5–7 and 14, As at positions 8 and 11, and a T at position 12. A strong preference exists for As at positions 4 and 15, Gs at positions 13 and 20, a T at position 3, and a C at position 19. Lastly, a moderate preference for Ts was observed at positions 2, 9, and 16, for As at positions 1 and 10, and for Gs at positions 18 and 21. Examination of the data revealed the surprising finding that sequences previously identified as binding sites for Staf in the X. laevis tRNASec (xtRNASec site) and human U6 snRNA (hU6 site) promoters (3Myslinski E. Krol A. Carbon P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 203-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 4Schuster C. Myslinski E. Krol A. Carbon P. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3777-3787Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 5Schaub M. Myslinski E. Schuster C. Krol A. Carbon P. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 173-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) were not obtained in the selection experiment (Fig. 2 A). As a likely explanation, we hypothesized that the nonselected sites were bound with a lower affinity compared with the selected ones. We tested this possibility using quantitative competitive gel shift assays with three different probes: the nonselected xtRNASec and hU6 sites, and the sequence the most frequently selected, TTTACCCACAATGCATTGCGC, that we called the optimal site (Fig.2 A). It shows 86% identity to the Staf consensus binding site. The relative capacities of increasing concentrations of the two nonselected sites and the optimal site to compete for binding to Staf and Staf zinc finger domain (amino acids 249–475) with a constant concentration of the labeled optimal site were assessed. It is noteworthy that the protein concentrations of Staf and and Staf zinc finger domain were different, not allowing comparisons of the values between Fig. 2 B and Fig. 2 C. Fig. 2 B convincingly demonstrates that the xtRNASec and hU6 sites are bound by Staf with a lower affinity than that of the optimal site, but with varying magnitudes. At a competitor concentration inhibiting 50% of the maximal binding (IC50), Staf bound about 30- and 180-fold more tightly the optimal sequence than the xtRNASec and hU6 sites, respectively (Fig. 2 B). Similarly, Fig. 2 C shows that the Staf zinc finger domain possesses a 7- and 60-fold better binding capacity to the optimal sequence, with comparison to the xtRNASec and hU6 sites. Taken together, these results indicate that the conditions employed in the binding site selection experiment were highly stringent, resulting in the selection of sites that are bound with a higher affinity than the Staf-responsive elements in the Xenopus tRNASec and human U6 promoters. The amino acid sequence of the seven zinc fingers of the Staf DNA binding domain is 95% conserved (95% identity, 98.5% similarity) between the Xenopus Staf and ZNF143, its human ortholog (7Myslinski E. Krol A. Carbon P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21998-22006Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). In contrast, the sequence of the Staf-responsive elements in the Xenopus tRNASec and human U6 promoters are clearly divergent, showing only 47% identity (Fig. 2 A). This raises the issue of whether the same set of zinc fingers establishes contacts with DNA regulatory motifs that are divergent in sequences. DNase I footprinting provides a means to investigate stable protein-DNA interactions. Also, differences in the mode of binding of various proteins can often be discerned using this methodology. Footprinting experiments were carried out on DNA fragments derived from positions −280 to −102 in the X. laevis tRNASec and −357 to −171 in the human U6 promoters. As to the Staf constructs, we generated a series of recombinant polypeptides containing the glutathione S-transferase fused to zinc fingers 2–7 (Zf 2–7), 1–5 (Zf 1–5), 1–6 (Zf 1–6), and 1–7 (Zf 1–7) (Fig. 3). Each polypeptide was purified from Escherichia coli cell lysates by affinity chromatography. The DNase I footprints on the Xenopus tRNASec promoter are shown in Fig.4, A and B, with a summary of the data in Fig. 4 C. Zf 1–5 protected the phosphodiester backbone from positions −211 to −188 on the nontemplate strand and −214 to −191 on the template strand. Addition of finger 6 in Zf 1–6 increased the length of the footprint beyond that of Zf 1–5, yielding additional protection to positions −214 and −219 on the nontemplate and template strands, respectively. With Zf 1–7, the nontemplate strand is strongly protected from positions −216 to −188 and the template strand from −219 to −191. Thus, addition of the seventh zinc finger in Zf 1–7 led to a significantly longer protection on the nontemplate strand only, compared with the footprint obtained with Zf 1–6. Deletion of zinc finger 1 in Zf 2–7 led to a proximally shortened protection because the footprint extends from −198 and −195 on the nontemplate and template strands, respectively. Inspection of the carboxyl- and amino-terminal deletion end points helped fix the relative orientations of the protein and DNA: Staf sits along the DNA with the carboxyl terminus oriented toward the 5′-end and the amino terminus toward the 3′-end of the Staf-responsive element.Figure 4DNase I footprint analysis of Staf zinc finger polypeptides binding to the xtRNA Sec promoter. DNA fragments, from base pairs −280 to −102, were labeled on the nontemplate (A) or template (B) strands and digested with DNase I in the absence of added proteins (−) (A, lanes 2, 6, and 8; B, lanes 4, 6, and 8) or with 0.5 μg of the indicated zinc finger polypeptide (Zf 1–7: A, lane 3, and B, lane 2; Zf 1–5: A and B, lane 7; Zf 1–6:A, lane 4, and B, lane 3; Zf 2–7: A and B, lane 9). Guanine- and adenine-specific chemical cleavages were included as markers (G+A) (A and B, lanes 1 and 5). Nucleotide positions within the tRNASec promoter are indicated. C, summary of the DNase I footprints. The nucleotide sequences of the nontemplate (nt, upper strand) and template (t, lower strand) strands of the Xenopus tRNASec promoter are given from nucleotides −222 to −185. The Staf-responsive element is boxed. The extent of DNase I protection in complexes formed with Zf 1–7, Zf 1–6, Zf 1–5, and Zf 2–7 is shown as hatched (nontemplate strand) and solid (template strand) bars.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In contrast to the results with the Xenopus tRNASec promoter, Zf 1–5 failed to yield a footprint on the human U6 promoter at similar or higher protein-DNA ratios. Zf 1–7 and Zf 2–7, however, did lead to DNase I footprints, as shown for the template strand of the human U6 promoter in Fig.5 A, with a summary of the data in Fig. 5 B. Clearly, Zf 2–7 protected the phosphodiester backbone within a region lying between −247 and −221. Surprisingly, the addition of zinc finger 1 in Zf 1–7 did not extend the footprint, whereas it did provoke an additional backbone protection of 4 nucleotides on the template strand of the Xenopus tRNASec promoter (Fig. 4 C). These results definitely show that a same protein can generate distinctive protection patterns on two different Staf-responsive elements. Furthermore, and most importantly, the identical protection patterns obtained with Zf 2–7 and Zf 1–7 on the human U6 promoter suggest that zinc finger 1 forms a loose contact with the U6 Staf-responsive element or does not bind the DNA at all. This contrasts with the protein-DNA complex established with the Xenopus tRNASec promoter, in which zinc finger 1 very likely contacts the DNA. It is well known that DNase I exhibits sequence preference, inducing nonrandom cleavages of DNA. Furthermore, it is very likely that not all the nucleotides within a region protected by a protein in a DNA-protein complex are involved in the interaction. Lastly, the bulkiness of DNase I can limit access to the complex. For all these reasons, DNase I footprinting does not provide an unbiased view of DNA-protein complexes. We therefore sought those nucleosides in the Staf-responsive elements that are contacted by the wild-type and truncated Staf DNA binding domains. To this end, missing nucleoside experiments were carried out using hydroxyl radicals (18Hayes J.H. Tullius T.D. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 9521-9527Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). This reagent generates random cleavages of the phosphodiester backbone, resulting in a 1-nucleoside gap per DNA molecule. The abilities of GST fusions of the wild-type (Zf 1–7) and truncated zinc finger domains to bind the gapped DNA were subsequently assayed by gel mobility shifts, in which the Staf complexes were separated from the free DNA. Both the complexed and free DNAs were isolated and analyzed on a sequencing gel for the determination of the cleavage pattern in the bound and free samples. In such an assay, a nucleoside that is important to forming the DNA-protein complex yields a weak or missing band, on the sequencing gel, in the lane containing the DNA that was bound to the protein. Conversely, a high intensity band appears in the lane where the free DNA was applied. This approach was used to examine the important contacts made by Zf 1–7 and Zf 1–6 to both strands of the xtRNASec, hU6 and optimal sites. The pattern of DNA fragments resulting from these experiments is shown in Fig.6, A, B, and C for the xtRNASec, optimal, and hU6 sites, respectively, and a compilation of the data is shown in in Fig. 6 D; the 21-bp consensus sequence stands as a numbering reference, the base pairs of the three sites being numbered −1 to 22, starting at the 5′-end of the top strand (see Fig. 6 D). Densitometry of the autoradiograms revealed the relative importance of the individual bases to the formation or maintenance of a Staf-DNA complex. Although interacting nucleosides were detected on both strands of the DNA, contacts to the nontemplate strand appear to be more important than to the template strand. Missing nucleoside experiments between Zf 1–7 and the three sites revealed extensive interference patterns. Obviously, removal of any nucleoside from positions 1–20 and 22 on the nontemplate strand or 2–22 on the template strand in the xtRNASec site (Fig. 6, A and D) and positions 1–20 on the nontemplate strand and 3–20 on the template strand in the optimal site (Fig. 6, B and D) strongly interfered with the binding of Zf 1–7. This result is quite different from that obtained with the hU6 site, where the interference pattern is elongated in the 5′ part of the Staf element and shortened in its 3′ part and involves nucleosides at positions −1 to 15 and 1 to 16 of the nontemplate and template strands, respectively (Fig. 6, C and D). Surprisingly, the same missing nucleoside patterns were observed on both strands, whether Zf 1–7 or Zf 1–6 was added to the gapped xtRNASec, optimal, and hU6 probes (Fig. 6 D). The absence of additional nucleoside requirements in the presence of zinc finger 7 strongly suggests that zinc finger 7 does not establish base-specific contacts with the DNA. To bolster this interpretation, we next analyzed the recognition properties of Zf 1–6 by using it, under stringent conditions, to select binding sites from an oligonucleotide pool of random sequences. Fifty-one amplified products from the sixth selection cycle were cloned and sequenced. As shown in Fig. 7, the fusion protein containing zinc fingers 1–6 (Zf 1–6) led to a consensus identical to that obtained with the entire seven-zinc finger domain (Zf 1–7; see also Fig. 1). Collectively, these results convincingly demonstrate that zinc finger 7 does not specifically contact the bases in Staf-DNA complexes. To define the contribution of the amino-terminal zinc finger 1 to the formation of Staf-DNA complexes, we examined the important contacts effected by Zf 2–7 to both strands of the xtRNASec, optimal, and hU6 sites. Again, the missing nucleoside assay was performed. The interference signals observed for the binding of Zf 2–7 to the xtRNASec and optimal sites were very different in their 3′ parts from those found for the Zf 1–7 binding. Deletion of zinc finger 1 in Zf 2–7 provoked a reduction of the interference pattern of 8 and 5 nucleosides on the template strands of the xtRNASec and optimal sites, respectively (Fig. 6, A, B, and D). Likewise, on the nontemplate strand, a reduction of the interference signal of 7 (position 21 being excluded; see Fig.6 D) and 6 nucleosides was observed for the xtRNASec and optimal sites, respectively (Fig. 6, A, B, and D). This demonstrates a loss of protein-DNA contacts at the 3′-end of the sites resulting from the zinc finger deletion and suggests that the binding site for zinc finger 1 resides between base pairs 15–22 for the xtRNASec site and 15–20 for the optimal site. In stark contrast, the same deletion did not alter the Zf 1–7 missing nucleoside pattern to the hU6 site (Fig. 6, C and D). These observed differential effects strongly argue in favor of zinc finger 1 contacting the DNA in the xtRNASec and optimal sites, but not in the hU6 site. If base-specific contacts are to be invoked for the binding of zinc finger 1 to the DNA, then the binding sites selected, with Zf 2–7, from a pool of mixed oligonucleotides should not contain th"

Previous biochemical studies have shown that the Rad4 and Rad23 proteins are associated in a stoichiometric complex named NEF2, and the Rad7 and Rad16 proteins form another stoichiometric complex named NEF4. While NEF2 is indispensable for the incision of UV-damaged DNA in the in vitro reconstituted system, NEF4 stimulates the incision reaction. Both NEF2 and NEF4 bind UV-damaged DNA, which raises the intriguing possibility that these two complexes cooperate to achieve the high degree of specificity for DNA damage demarcation required for nucleotide excision repair in vivo. Consistent with this hypothesis, we find that NEF2 and NEF4 bind in a synergistic fashion to UV-damaged DNA in a reaction that is dependent on ATP. We also purify the Rad7 protein and show that it binds DNA but has no preference for UV-damaged DNA. Rad7 physically interacts with NEF2, suggesting a role for Rad7 in linking NEF2 with NEF4.

A defect in NER in yeast results in an extreme sensitivity to UV light and a hypermutational phenotype, and in humans, defective NER is the underlying cause of the skin cancer-prone syndrome xeroderma pigmentosum, observations that underscore the importance of this repair system in neutralizing the cytotoxicity and genotoxicity of UV light (1Friedberg E.C. Walker G.C. Siede W. DNA Repair and Mutagenesis. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.1995Google Scholar). During NER, the DNA lesion is first bound by damage recognition proteins, followed by the recruitment of additional NER factors and DNA unwinding by the two DNA helicases Rad3 and Rad25, present in TFIIH, to create a DNA “bubble.” Dual incision of the damage-containing strand in the unwound DNA, on the 5′-side by the Rad1-Rad10 nuclease and on the 3′-side by Rad2, results in the release of the lesion in the form of an oligonucleotide ∼ 30 nucleotides in length (for a discussion, see Ref. 2Habraken Y. Sung P. Prakash S. Prakash L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10718-10722Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). A conserved set of proteins performs the same function in humans (3Mu D. Park C.-H. Matsunaga T. Hsu D.S. Reardon J.T. Sancar A. J. Biol.

Biochemical fractionation of Saccharomyces cerevisiae extract has revealed distinct subassemblies of the NER proteins, termed nucleotide excision repair factors or NEFs. Thus, Rad14 associates with the Rad1-Rad10 endonuclease to form NEF1 (6Guzder S.N. Sung P. Prakash L. Prakash S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8903-8910Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), Rad4 and Rad23 combine to form NEF2 (7Guzder S.N. Habraken Y. Sung P. Prakash L. Prakash S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12973-12976Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar), and Rad2 associates with the six subunit RNA polymerase II transcription factor TFIIH to form NEF3 (2Habraken Y. Sung P. Prakash S. Prakash L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10718-10722Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The combination of NEF1, NEF2, NEF3, and the heterotrimeric ssDNA binding factor replication protein A (RPA) is sufficient to mediate dual incision of UV-damaged DNA in an in vitro reconstituted system (7Guzder S.N. Habraken Y. Sung P. Prakash L. Prakash S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12973-12976Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar), indicating that the basal NER machinery consists of these factors and also lends credence to the suggestion that NER is mediated by the stepwise incorporation of the aforementioned NEFs and RPA at the damage site (2Habraken Y. Sung P. Prakash S. Prakash L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10718-10722Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). At the genomic level, another level of complexity exists in the repair of transcribed versus nontranscribed DNA. The repair of the transcribed strand requires the RAD26 gene, a homolog of the human CSB gene (8van Gool A.J. Verhage R. Swagemakers S.M.A. van de Putte P. Brouwer J. Troelstra C. Bootsma D. Hoeijmakers J.H.J. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5361-5369Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar), whereas the repair of the nontranscribed strand requires the RAD7 and RAD16 genes (9Verhage R. Zeeman A.-M. de Groot N. Gleig F. Gang D.D. van de Putte P. Brouwer J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6135-6142Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 10Mueller J.P. Smerdon M.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 3457-3464Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Deletion of RAD7 or RAD16 causes an intermediate level of UV sensitivity, and the UV sensitivity of the rad7Δ rad16Δ double mutant is the same as that of the rad7Δ and rad16Δ single mutants. The Rad7 and Rad16 proteins exist together in a stable complex termed NEF4, and the purified Rad7-Rad16 heterodimer binds UV-damaged DNA in an ATP-dependent manner (11Guzder S.N. Sung P. Prakash L. Prakash S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21665-21668Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). NEF4 also has a DNA-dependent ATPase activity, and UV irradiation of DNA results in a marked inhibition of ATP hydrolysis (12Guzder S.N. Sung P. Prakash L. Prakash S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6292-6296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). These observations have suggested a model in which NEF4 utilizes the free energy from ATP hydrolysis to translocate on DNA. Because of the attenuation of the ATPase activity, NEF4 stops translocating at the damage site and becomes stably bound to the damage. In this scenario, NEF4 would be the first protein complex to arrive at the damage site and would serve as the nucleation site for the subsequent assembly of the other repair factors (11Guzder S.N. Sung P. Prakash L. Prakash S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21665-21668Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 12Guzder S.N. Sung P. Prakash L. Prakash S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6292-6296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Consistent with this hypothesis, the addition of NEF4 to the reconstituted NER system results in a marked stimulation of the proficiency of the incision reaction (11Guzder S.N. Sung P. Prakash L. Prakash S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21665-21668Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In addition to NEF4, the Rad4-Rad23 complex (NEF2) also recognizes UV damage (13Guzder S.N. Sung P. Prakash L. Prakash S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31541-31546Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 14Jansen L.E.T. Verhage R.A. Brouwer J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33111-33114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). However, by contrast to the damage binding activity of NEF4, which is strongly dependent upon ATP, NEF2 damage binding shows no such dependence on a nucleotide co-factor (13Guzder S.N. Sung P. Prakash L. Prakash S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31541-31546Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). To begin delineating the intricacy of the damage recognition step in NER, we examine here whether the combination of NEF2 and NEF4 is more adept at binding UV-damaged DNA than either protein complex alone. Our results indicate a synergistic enhancement of damage binding by NEF2 and NEF4. We also purify the Rad7 protein and show that it binds DNA but has no specificity for UV-damaged DNA. Furthermore, we provide evidence for the physical interaction of Rad7 with NEF2, which suggests a specific function for Rad7 as a bridging factor between NEF2 and NEF4. The anti-Rad7, anti-Rad4, anti-Rad16, and anti-Rad23 antibodies used in this study were all affinity purified from rabbit antisera raised against portions of the respective proteins expressed in and purified from Escherichia coli as described (11Guzder S.N. Sung P. Prakash L. Prakash S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21665-21668Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 13Guzder S.N. Sung P. Prakash L. Prakash S. J. Biol.

Prakash S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21665-21668Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). For overexpression of the glutathione S-transferase (GST)-Rad7 fusion protein, a 2.3-kilobase Xba I-Eco RI fragment containing the entire Rad7 coding sequence was cloned in plasmid pGEX-3X to yield the GST-Rad7 expression plasmid pR7.4. The protease-deficient yeast strain LY2 harboring plasmid pR7.8 was grown overnight to the stationary phase in complete synthetic medium lacking leucine. The overnight starter culture was diluted ten times with fresh medium that also contained 2% galactose and was then incubated at 30 °C for 10 h before the cells were harvested by centrifugation. We obtained 300 g of yeast paste from 80 liters of culture. Cell paste (300 g) of yeast strain LY2 containing pR7.8 was resuspended in cell breakage buffer containing protease inhibitors and disrupted by the French press. After clarification of the crude cell lysate by centrifugation (100,000 × g, 90 min), the Rad7 protein was quantitatively precipitated by the addition of 0.22 g of ammonium sulfate per ml of lysate. The ammonium sulfate pellet was collected by centrifugation, and proteins were redissolved in K buffer (20 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.5, 10% glycerol, 0.5 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol) to give Fraction I with an ionic strength equivalent to 100 mmKCl and then loaded onto a Q-Sepharose column (2.5 × 5 cm; 25 ml). The Q-Sepharose flow-through (Fraction II) was applied onto a SP-Sepharose column (2.5 × 5 cm; 25 ml), which was developed with a 250-ml gradient of 100–500 mm KCl in K buffer. Fractions containing the peak of Rad7 protein (Fraction III) eluting at an ionic strength of 220 mm KCl were pooled, loaded onto a MacroHAP hydroxyapatite column (Bio-Rad; 2 ml), and equilibrated in K buffer with 100 mm KCl, which was developed with a 40-ml gradient of 20–300 mm potassium phosphate in the same buffer. Fractions containing Rad7 (Fraction IV; 7 ml) eluting at an ionic strength equivalent to 150 mm phosphate were dialyzed against 1 liter of buffer A (20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.0, 10% glycerol, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.01% Nonidet P-40, 250 mm KOAc, 1 mm 2-mercaptoethanol) for 5 h at 4 °C. The dialysate was mixed gently with 0.3 ml of Ni-NTA-agarose matrix (Qiagen) for 3 h at 4 °C. The matrix was washed successively with buffer containing 10, 20, 30, 40, and 100 mm imidazole. Most (>85%) of the Rad7 protein was recovered in the 100 mm imidazole eluate (Fraction V), which was loaded onto a Mono-S column (HR 5/5) equilibrated in buffer A containing 100 mm KCl. The Mono-S column was developed with a 12-ml gradient of 200–600 mm KCl, collecting 0.5-ml fractions. The fractions containing nearly homogeneous Rad7 protein were pooled (Fraction VI) and concentrated to a small volume using a Centricon 30 concentrator and stored in small aliquots at −70 °C. To facilitate purification of Rad23 protein from yeast cells, the RAD23 gene was cloned downstream of the highly expressed yeast ADC1 promoter to yield the multicopy plasmid pJW112 (2μm, ADC1-RAD23). Rad23 protein overexpressed in the protease-deficient yeast strain LP2749–9B was purified to homogeneity as described previously (16Guzder S.N. Bailly V. Sung P. Prakash L. Prakash S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8385-8388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The NEF2 complex, comprised of Rad4 and Rad23 proteins, was purified to homogeneity from yeast cells overexpressing the Rad4 protein alone because Rad23 protein is present in considerable molar excess over Rad4 protein. During the purification procedure, the Rad4 and Rad23 proteins were monitored by Western analysis using affinity purified antibodies as described previously (13Guzder S.N. Sung P. Prakash L. Prakash S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31541-31546Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The Rad14 protein, Rad1-Rad10 complex, TFIIH, and RPA were purified as described (7Guzder S.N. Habraken Y. Sung P. Prakash L. Prakash S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12973-12976Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). A 130-base pair DNA fragment containing a stretch of thymine residues (17Guzder S.N. Sung P. Prakash L. Prakash S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5433-5437Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) was labeled at the 5′-end with 32P and incubated with the indicated amounts of Rad7, NEF2, and NEF4 in 10 μl of reaction buffer (30 mmpotassium HEPES, pH 7.5, 30 mm KCl, 5 mmMgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin) and containing either 50 ng or the indicated amounts of Hae III linearized ΦX174 double-stranded DNA as competitor DNA. After 10 min at 30 °C, samples were mixed with 2 μl of gel loading buffer (0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 50% glycerol, and 0.05% Orange G) and electrophoresed in a 4.5% polyacrylamide gel in TAE buffer (40 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.4, 1 mmEDTA) at 4 °C. The gels were dried and subjected to autoradiography using Kodak MR films, and autoradiograms were quantitated by a Bio-Rad GS670 densitometer. The NER reaction was carried out as described (7Guzder S.N. Habraken Y. Sung P. Prakash L. Prakash S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12973-12976Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Briefly, 75 ng of NEF2, 50 ng of RPA, 65 ng of NEF1, 65 ng of NEF3, and 60 ng of NEF4 or Rad7, where indicated, were incubated in reaction buffer (45 mm potassium HEPES, pH 7.9, 8 mm MgCl2, 120 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1.5 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm ATP, an ATP regenerating system consisting of 30 mm creatine phosphate and 200 ng of creatine kinase) with 150 ng of M13mp18 DNA that had been irradiated with UV light emitting at 254 nm to a total dose of 30 J/m2. Reaction mixtures were incubated at 30 °C for varying times, deproteinized by treatment with SDS and proteinase K (7Guzder S.N. Habraken Y. Sung P. Prakash L. Prakash S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12973-12976Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar), and analyzed in a 0.8% agarose gel in TAE buffer (20 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.4, 0.5 mm EDTA). The DNA species were visualized by staining with ethidium bromide. The GST-Rad7 fusion protein was overexpressed in the E. coli strain JM101, using the plasmid pR7.4. After induction with 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-b-d-galactopyranoside, cells were broken and the GST-Rad7 fusion protein, which was localized in the inclusion bodies, was solubilized in 1.5% Sarkosyl buffer containing 0.1 m ethanolamine and 10 mm EDTA (pH 8.0). Triton X-100 was added to 2% to the supernatant containing the GST-Rad7 protein, and after clarification, the preparation was dialyzed extensively against phosphate-buffered saline at 4 °C. The GST-Rad7 protein in this fraction was present at approximately 1.5 mg/ml. A Rad7 affinity matrix was generated by binding GST-Rad7 protein to glutathione-Sepharose beads according to the instructions of the manufacturer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The matrix was washed with 10 volumes of buffer (20 mm Tris acetate, 20% glycerol, 0.5 mm EDTA, and 0.01% Nonidet P-40) containing 50 mm KOAc, pH 7.0 and then resuspended in an equal volume of buffer containing 50 mm KOAc. An aliquot (2.5 μl) of the beads was incubated with buffer containing 20 mm glutathione to check the amount of Rad7 bound to the matrix (1 μg/μl beads). A similar protocol was followed to generate GST-Sepharose beads, using lysate containing GST (6.4 μg/μl of beads). For binding experiments, purified Rad23 (0.5 μg) or NEF2 (1.5 μg) was mixed with 10 μl of the GST- or GST-Rad7 affinity matrix in 150 μl of buffer Q (20 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.0, 20% glycerol, 1.5 mmEDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.01% Nonidet P-40) containing 50 mm KOAc at 4 °C for 3 h. After removal of the unbound proteins, the matrix was washed with 0.2 ml of buffer Q containing 0.2, 0.4, and 0.8 m KOAc. Proteins were then eluted into 40 μl of 2% SDS by incubation of the affinity beads containing bound proteins at 37 °C for 10 min. The supernatants (5 μl), washes (5 μl), and SDS-eluates (1.5 μl) were analyzed for the presence of NEF2 or Rad23 protein by immunoblotting. Binding of NEF4 to UV-damaged DNA is strongly stimulated by ATP or ATPγS (11Guzder S.N. Sung P. Prakash L. Prakash S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21665-21668Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar,12Guzder S.N. Sung P. Prakash L. Prakash S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6292-6296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), whereas NEF2 shows no dependence on a nucleotide in its binding to UV-irradiated DNA (13Guzder S.N. Sung P. Prakash L. Prakash S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31541-31546Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). To determine whether NEF2 and NEF4 interact synergistically in the binding of UV-damaged DNA, we used concentrations of NEF2 and NEF4 at which little binding of the UV-irradiated DNA fragment is seen with either factor alone and then investigated the effect of mixing the two NEFs in the presence of ATP. As shown in Fig. 1, A and B, whereas only ∼5% or less of the UV-damaged DNA fragment was bound by NEF2 or NEF4, combining the two NEFs resulted in a marked elevation in the level of binding (∼70%), an increase much higher than the simple sum of the binding activities seen with the two protein complexes (Fig. 1 B). Concomitant with the increased binding of the UV-damaged DNA fragment, nucleoprotein complexes that have retarded mobilities (marked collectively as C* in Fig. 1 A) compared with those formed between the DNA substrate and NEF2 or NEF4 alone (labeled C in Fig. 1 A) were seen. Immunoblotting after transfer of the nucleoprotein complex from the polyacrylamide gel onto nitrocellulose has indicated the presence of both NEF2 and NEF4 in the C* complex, thus confirming that C* was a ternary complex consisting of the damaged DNA, NEF2, and NEF4. Under the conditions used, undamaged DNA is not bound by the combination of NEF2 and NEF4 (Fig.1 C). Because NEF4 binds and hydrolyzes ATP, and the presence of either ATP or ATPγS is critical for optimal damage-specific DNA binding by NEF4 (11Guzder S.N. Sung P. Prakash L. Prakash S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21665-21668Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 12Guzder S.N. Sung P. Prakash L. Prakash S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6292-6296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), it was of considerable interest to examine whether the synergistic cooperation between NEF2 and NEF4 in damage-specific DNA binding is dependent on the presence of ATP. To do this, NEF2 alone, NEF4 alone, and the combination of NEF2 and NEF4 were incubated with undamaged DNA or with UV-irradiated DNA in the absence or the presence of ATP. As shown in Fig. 1, C and D, combining NEF2 and NEF4 results in a synergistic increase in the binding of UV-damaged DNA. Significantly, the formation of the NEF2-NEF4-UV-damaged DNA ternary complex was greatly diminished when ATP was omitted from the reaction mixture (Fig. 1 C, compare lanes 16 and 17), indicating a requirement for ATP in the formation of the ternary nucleoprotein complex. As reported previously (11Guzder S.N. Sung P. Prakash L. Prakash S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21665-21668Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 12Guzder S.N. Sung P. Prakash L. Prakash S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6292-6296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) and reiterated here, ATPγS, like ATP, was effective in promoting DNA damage binding by NEF4 (Fig. 1 C, compare lanes 14 and 15 with lane 13). ATPγS, however, did not stimulate the formation of the ternary complex of damaged DNA with NEF2 and NEF4 (Fig. 1 C, compare lanes 16 and 18). This result stands in contrast to the damage binding by NEF4 alone, and it suggests that either only ATP is effective in inducing a conformation conducive for the interaction of NEF4 with NEF2 or that ATP hydrolysis is in fact indispensable for mediating the interaction of NEF2 with NEF4. No significant binding of the undamaged DNA fragment was seen even with the combination of NEF2 and NEF4, regardless of whether a nucleotide was present or not (Fig.1 C). The Rad7 protein does not contain any known conserved sequence motifs that might suggest a biochemical function for the protein. To gain insight into the biochemical role of Rad7, we overexpressed the protein in yeast cells (Fig. 2 A) and purified it to near homogeneity (Fig. 2 B). For the overexpression of Rad7 protein, the RAD7 gene tagged with a 6-histidine sequence at the amino terminus was placed under the control of the GAL-PGK promoter to yield plasmid pR7.8. For purifying Rad7 protein, extract from 300 g of the protease-deficient yeast strain LY2 harboring plasmid pR7.8 was subjected to ammonium sulfate precipitation, followed by chromatographic fractionation in columns of Q-Sepharose, SP-Sepharose, hydroxyapatite, nickel NTA-agarose, and finally in Mono-S, as described under “Materials and Methods.” The elution of Rad7 from the various columns was monitored by immunoblotting until the hydroxyapatite step, where Rad7 could be identified by Coomassie Blue staining of polyacrylamide gels in which the column fractions had been run. When 1 μg of Rad7 protein eluting from the last step of purification in Mono-S column (Fraction VI Rad7 protein) was analyzed by denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Coomassie Blue staining, only the Rad7 protein was seen, indicating a high degree of purity of the preparation (Fig. 2 B). The purified Rad7 preparation was devoid of Rad16 protein, as no Rad16 was detected when 1 μg of the Rad7 preparation was subjected to immunoblot analysis with anti-Rad16 antibodies under conditions wherein even 1 ng of Rad16 would have been seen. We obtained 60 μg of Rad7 protein from the starting 300 g of yeast paste used, representing an overall recovery of 10%. Fraction VI Rad7 protein was used in the DNA binding and in vitro repair reactions described below. Because NEF4 has a UV damage-specific DNA binding activity, we examined whether Rad7 protein alone can bind UV-damaged DNA. The results in Fig.3 A show that Rad7 has a DNA binding activity as indicated by the formation of a nucleoprotein complex with the 32P-labeled DNA fragment. However, unlike the Rad7-Rad16 complex, Rad7 protein by itself does not discriminate between the UV-damaged and undamaged DNA, as essentially the same level of nucleoprotein complex was formed with both DNA species (Fig.3 A). The same results were obtained when ATP was omitted from the reaction buffer (data not shown). Furthermore, the binding of Rad7 to either the UV-irradiated or unirradiated DNA substrate can be effectively competed away by adding low amounts of a nonlabeled DNA to the preformed nucleoprotein complex (Fig. 3 A), suggesting that the Rad7-DNA nucleoprotein complex is not very stable. In sharp contrast, NEF4 binds specifically and stably to UV-irradiated DNA even in the presence of a 100-fold excess of competitor DNA (Fig.3 B, lane 7). These results indicate that Rad7 is a DNA binding protein but it is devoid of the ability to recognize UV lesions. In further characterizing the function of Rad7 protein, we considered the possibility that Rad7 may act as a physical link between NEF2 and NEF4. Because even with overexpression, only a small amount of Rad7 protein could be purified from yeast cells, to facilitate our study, we expressed Rad7 as a fusion polypeptide to GST and purified it from E. coli according to standard procedure entailing affinity chromatography on glutathione-Sepharose. For examining whether there was a specific interaction between Rad7 and NEF2, either GST alone or purified GST-Rad7 immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose was incubated with purified NEF2. The GST-Rad7 affinity matrix and the control GST matrix were washed with increasing concentrations of potassium acetate, and the bound NEF2 was eluted by treatment with SDS. The starting material, the supernatant containing unbound NEF2, the potassium acetate washes, and the SDS eluates were subjected to immunoblotting with anti-Rad4 and anti-Rad23 antibodies to determine the amount of NEF2 that was specifically retained on the GST-Rad7 affinity matrix. Significantly, whereas greater than 90% of the input NEF2 was retained on the GST-Rad7 matrix, there was no binding of NEF2 to the GST matrix (Fig.4 A). Because we had purified Rad23 protein available (16Guzder S.N. Bailly V. Sung P. Prakash L. Prakash S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8385-8388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), we examined whether there was a direct interaction between Rad23 and GST-Rad7. However, under conditions wherein NEF2 interacts strongly with GST-Rad7, we did not observe any binding of the Rad23 protein to the GST-Rad7 matrix (Fig.4 B). Taken together, the results demonstrate a specific and direct interaction of Rad7 with NEF2, but the interaction may be through the Rad4 protein or it may occur only with the Rad4-Rad23 complex. Rad7 by itself shows no damage-specific binding (Fig. 3 A), and it did not enhance the binding of UV-damaged DNA by NEF2 (data not shown). In a previous study (11Guzder S.N. Sung P. Prakash L. Prakash S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21665-21668Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), we showed that the addition of NEF4 to an in vitro NER reaction reconstituted with highly purified NEF1, NEF2, NEF3, and RPA markedly increased the efficiency of the damage-specific incision reaction. Because Rad7 interacts with NEF2, we examined whether the repair efficiency could be enhanced by the inclusion of the Rad7 protein in the reconstituted NER reaction. The addition of Rad7 to the basic incision reaction, however, did not result in significant stimulation or inhibition of the UV damage-specific incision (Fig.5 A, compare lanes 10 and 11 with lanes 6 and 7, respectively, and Fig. 5 B), whereas, as reported previously, the inclusion of NEF4 enhances the incision reaction by 4–5-fold (Fig.5 A, compare lanes 8 and 9 with lanes 6 and 7, respectively, and Fig.5 B). These biochemical results and the results from previous genetic studies are consistent with the suggestion that both Rad7 and Rad16 proteins are required for the functional integrity of NEF4 in UV damage recognition and in NER enhancement. Genetic studies have indicated that the RAD4 gene is indispensable for the NER of UV-damaged DNA in vivo, whereas the RAD23 gene affects the efficiency of the repair process (15Watkins J.F. Sung P. Prakash L. Prakash S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7757-7765Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Previous studies from our laboratory have shown that the Rad4 and Rad23 proteins are tightly associated in a stoichiometric complex called NEF2. Consistent with the genetic results, NEF2 was shown to be indispensable for the dual incision of UV-damaged DNA in the in vitro NER reconstitution studies (7Guzder S.N. Habraken Y. Sung P. Prakash L. Prakash S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12973-12976Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Because the Rad4 and Rad23 proteins contain no identifiable sequence motifs that would predict an enzymatic activity, it had remained unclear as to whether NEF2 was important for NER by providing a distinct biochemical function or whether it primarily served as a scaffold in the assembly of the NER machinery. In fact, our previous studies have demonstrated that Rad23 interacts with Rad14 protein and with TFIIH (16Guzder S.N. Bailly V. Sung P. Prakash L. Prakash S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8385-8388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). More recently, we showed that NEF2 possesses a DNA binding ability that is highly specific for UV-damaged DNA, but Rad23 by itself shows no DNA binding ability (13Guzder S.N. Sung P. Prakash L. Prakash S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31541-31546Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), indicating that either Rad4 is the damage recognition subunit of NEF2, or Rad4 and Rad23 proteins are both required for the DNA damage binding activity of NEF2. Similar to the DNA damage recognition ability of NEF2, the equivalent human NER complex consisting of the XPC and HHR23B proteins, also binds preferentially to UV-damaged DNA (18Reardon J.T. Mu D. Sancar A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19451-19456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 19Sugasawa K. Ng J.M.Y. Masutani C. Iwai S. van der Spek P.J. Eker A.P.M. Hanaoka F. Bootsma D. Hoeijmakers J.H.J. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 223-232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (742) Google Scholar). Taken together, the biochemical studies have provided tangible evidence that during NER, NEF2 serves as a damage recognition factor, and in addition, plays an important role in the assembly of the incision machinery at the damage site via specific protein-protein interactions (16Guzder S.N. Bailly V. Sung P. Prakash L. Prakash S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8385-8388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The RAD7 and RAD16 genes affect the efficiency of NER in vivo with a particular requirement of these genes in the repair of nontranscribed DNA (9Verhage R. Zeeman A.-M. de Groot N. Gleig F. Gang D.D. van de Putte P. Brouwer J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6135-6142Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 10Mueller J.P. Smerdon M.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 3457-3464Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The addition of Rad7-Rad16 complex, NEF4, to the reconstituted NER reaction results in a marked stimulation of the incision of UV-damaged DNA (11Guzder S.N. Sung P. Prakash L. Prakash S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21665-21668Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Consistent with the presence in Rad16 of Walker-type sequence motifs suggestive of the ability to bind and hydrolyze a nucleoside triphosphate, our biochemical studies have indicated that NEF4 contains an intrinsic ATPase activity. The NEF4 ATPase activity requires DNA, and double-stranded DNA is more effective than single-stranded DNA for its activation (12Guzder S.N. Sung P. Prakash L. Prakash S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6292-6296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Like NEF2, NEF4 also binds specifically to UV-damaged DNA. However, unlike NEF2, which shows no dependence on ATP for damage binding, NEF4 requires ATP for maximal binding to UV-damaged DNA. ATPγS is also effective, but to a lesser degree than ATP, in promoting DNA damage binding by NEF4 (12Guzder S.N. Sung P. Prakash L. Prakash S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6292-6296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), which has led to the deduction that ATP binding alone is sufficient to induce a conformational change in NEF4 conducive for damage binding. The ATPase activity of NEF4 is markedly inhibited by the presence of UV damage in the DNA (12Guzder S.N. Sung P. Prakash L. Prakash S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6292-6296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), suggesting that the free energy derived from ATP hydrolysis may fuel the translocation of NEF4 on DNA and that the movement of NEF4 is arrested upon encountering a DNA lesion. The lesion-bound NEF4 may then serve as the nucleation site for the loading of the remaining NER factors, including NEF1, NEF2, NEF3, and RPA. In addition to NEF2, Rad14, which is a component of NEF1, and RPA also bind UV-damaged DNA specifically (17Guzder S.N. Sung P. Prakash L. Prakash S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5433-5437Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 20Clugston C.K. McLaughlin K. Kenny M.K. Brown R. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 6375-6379PubMed Google Scholar, 21Burns J.L. Guzder S.N. Sung P. Prakash S. Prakash L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11607-11610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar); however, the sequence by which these damage recognition factors assemble at the site of lesion-bound NEF4 remains to be determined. To begin addressing the hypothesis that multiple damage recognition factors including NEF2 and NEF4 function together to achieve a high degree of specificity in damage demarcation during NER, we have now examined NEF2 and NEF4 for their possible cooperation in DNA damage recognition. Our results indicate that combining NEF2 and NEF4 results in synergistic binding of UV-irradiated DNA. We also find that the synergistic action of NEF2 and NEF4 in damage recognition is an ATP-dependent process, suggesting a role of ATP binding/hydrolysis in this reaction. To explore the role of Rad7 in NER, we overexpressed and purified this protein to near homogeneity. Our results show that Rad7 binds DNA but has no specificity for UV-damaged DNA template. Consistent with this result, addition of NEF4, but not of Rad7 alone, to the in vitro NER reaction results in marked stimulation of the incision reaction (Fig. 5). These observations suggest that either Rad16 protein by itself provides damage-specific binding in NEF4 or that the combination of Rad7 and Rad16 proteins is in fact necessary for the expression of damage-specific DNA binding. These scenarios have not yet been tested directly, since despite considerable efforts to purify the Rad16 protein we have thus far been unable to obtain a sufficient amount of highly purified Rad16 for these studies, which is because of the extremely low level of expression of Rad16 protein in the absence of Rad7 protein. Nevertheless, the fact that Rad16 contains two potential zinc binding, DNA binding motifs, a C4 motif and a C3HC4 ring finger motif (22Prakash S. Sung P. Prakash L. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1993; 27: 33-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar), supports the suggestion that Rad16 by itself can discern between normal and damaged DNA species. If that was the case, then it is quite possible that the DNA binding ability of Rad7 has a role in enhancing the affinity of Rad16 for damaged DNA, or it increases the stability of the nucleoprotein complex formed between NEF4 and damaged DNA. In addition to the DNA binding activity, Rad7 also has the ability to physically interact with NEF2. Rad7 contains regions of marked hydrophobicity, including 12 tandemly repeated leucine-rich motifs (22Prakash S. Sung P. Prakash L. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1993; 27: 33-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar), which may enable Rad7 to interact with NEF2. In summary, our results suggest that NEF4 functions as an ATP-dependent DNA damage sensor and as an assembly factor during the incision phase of NER, and they provide support for the notion that the damage recognition reaction involves hierarchical interactions among different damage binding factors. Recent studies have suggested an involvement of the Rad7 and Rad16 proteins in the post-incision phase of NER (23Reed S.H. You Z. Friedberg E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29481-29488Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Thus, it appears that NEF4 plays a multifunctional role in NER, viz. in the very initial step of damage recognition in cooperation with NEF2 as shown in our studies here and also in the post-incision phase (23Reed S.H. You Z. Friedberg E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29481-29488Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), perhaps in the turnover of the incision protein machinery, and in the recruitment of factors to perform the DNA repair synthesis reaction."

As the concentration of the corresponding transcripts decreases, in postmitotic cells, even if the genes are actively transcribed, it is likely that regulation of variant histone expression has relevant post-transcriptional components and that cellular factors affect histone mRNA stability and/or translation. Here we report that PIPPin, a protein that is highly enriched in the rat brain and contains a cold-shock domain, binds with high specificity to the transcripts that encode H1° and H3.3 histone variants. Both mRNAs are bound through the very end of their 3′-untranslated region that encompasses the polyadenylation signal. Although PIPPin is present both in the cytoplasm and the nucleus of nerve cells, PIPPin-RNA complexes can be obtained only from nuclear extracts.

Although a critical moment for setting new patterns of chromatin organization is the S phase of the cell cycle, it is now clear that chromatin can be remodeled also in the absence of DNA replication, by energy consuming complexes (1Griffin Burns L.

The possibility that remodeling also allows entrance, at topologically defined regions of the nucleus, of specific histone isotypes, which might locally modify chromatin organization even more, is provocative and deserves of attention. We previously demonstrated that, in the developing rat brain, the concentration of H1° and H3.3 mRNAs decreases between the embryonal day 18 (E18) and the postnatal day 10 (P10), whereas the corresponding genes are transcribed at the same rate at any stage studied, suggesting that the two genes are regulated mainly at post-transcriptional level (5Castiglia D.

We reported in a previous paper (19Castiglia D. Scaturro M. Nastasi T. Cestelli A. Di Liegro I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 218: 390-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) cloning and analysis of a cDNA encoding a putative RNA-binding protein, specifically expressed in the rat brain and conserved from Drosophila melanogaster to man. The protein, that contains two regions with chemical homology to double-stranded RNA-binding motifs (16Burd C.G. Dreyfuss G. Science. 1994; 265: 615-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (1734) Google Scholar) was called PIPPin after the first four amino acids of the second of these motifs (PIPP, in one-letter code). Here we report that PIPPin contains also a potential cold-shock domain (CSD1; for review, see Refs.20Graumann P.L. Marahiel M.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 286-290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar and 21Matsumoto K. Wolffe A.P. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 318-323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Within the latter, two short sequences are particularly interesting as they correspond to the so called ribonucleoprotein motifs 1 and 2 (RNP1 and RNP2), respectively, and are conserved among PIPPin and several other prokaryotic as well as eukaryotic nucleic acid-binding proteins. The presence, in PIPPin, of a CSD flanked on both sides by putative double-stranded RNA-binding motifs strongly suggested that the protein could really be an RNA-binding factor. The results reported in the present paper clearly demonstrate that this is in fact the case. Moreover, we found that PIPPin binds preferentially to RNAs encoding H3.3 and H1° histone variants. Using an in vitro culture system, we further demonstrate that PIPPin is present both in the cytoplasm and nucleus of nerve cells; however, its ability to bind RNA seems to be confined to the nucleus. We report that about one-half of nuclear PIPPin is more acidic (pI ≅ 6.0) than expected (pI = 7.7), thus suggesting that the protein would be post-translationally modified (perhaps by phosphorylation), in order to bind RNA. Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats and New Zealand rabbits (Stefano Morini, San Polo d'Enza, Italy) were housed and handled according to European Community Council Directive 86/609, OJL 358 1, 12 December 1987 (NIH Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, NIH Publication No. 85–23, 1985). Neuronal cultures were prepared from embryonic day 16 rat cerebral cortices, and cultured for 5–8 days in a selective, serum-free medium, on Primaria tissue culture dishes (Falcon), precoated with laminin (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), as described in detail elsewhere (22Cestelli A.

To obtain total post-nuclear, mitochondrial, microsomal, and post-microsomal (S-100) cell subfractions, fresh tissues from developing and adult rats or cultured neurons were processed as described previously (24Scaturro M.

Nuclear extracts were prepared according to Dignam et al. (25Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9164) Google Scholar). Protein concentration of all fractions was determined by the method described by Lowry et al. (26Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Some of the plasmids used for in vitro transcription of both radiolabeled and cold RNA probes were already described elsewhere (24Scaturro M. Nastasi T. Raimondi L. Bellafiore M. Cestelli A.

The other plasmids were constructed ad hoc, by subcloning different portions of the original inserts into the Bluescript KS+ plasmid (Stratagene). Briefly, to synthesize transcripts corresponding to most of the H1° mRNA, we used as template the original pMH1° (EMBL accession number X70685; Ref. 27Castiglia D. Gristina R. Scaturro M. Di Liegro I. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 1674Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), that contains an insert of 1711 nucleotides (nt). To obtain smaller H1° transcripts, we used the subclones described previously (24Scaturro M. Nastasi T. Raimondi L. Bellafiore M. Cestelli A. Di Liegro I. J. Biol.

To synthesize H3.3 mRNA, we used as template pDH3, obtained by ligation of the 5′ region of PDH 33-2- and the 3′-region of pDH 33-1 inserts (EMBL accession numberX73683; Ref. 5Castiglia D. Cestelli A. Scaturro M. Nastasi T. Di Liegro I. Neurochem. Res. 1994; 19: 1531-1537Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). To obtain smaller transcripts, corresponding to different portions of the untranslated region 3′ to the coding portion (3′-UTR) of H3.3 mRNA, we subcloned the following two regions of the H3.3 insert: 1) from nt 537 to nt 1107 (pR4: corresponding to the whole 3′-UTR, indicated as R4, in Fig. 3 B); 2) from nt 909 to 1107 (pM4: corresponding to the last 198 nt of 3′-UTR, indicated as M4, in Fig. 3 B). To synthesize the c-erbA α2 transcript, we used the pA1.3K plasmid, that contains an insert of about 1200 nt, corresponding to the full-length c-erbA α2 mRNA (28Castiglia D. Cestelli A. Di Liegro C.

Finally, to synthesize a maltose-binding protein (MBP-)/PIPPin fusion protein, the coding region of the PIPPin insert, from the Cx1 plasmid (accession number X89962: Ref. 19Castiglia D. Scaturro M.

The 5′- and 3′-primers included Eco RI and Pst I sites (underlined), respectively, to allow oriented cloning of the amplified fragment into the pMALTM c2 plasmid (New England BioLabs). All the subclones mentioned were sequenced, from both sides, by the Thermo Sequenase radiolabeled terminator cycle sequencing kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech).

For secondary structure predictions, the amino acid sequence of PIPPin was submitted to The PredictProtein server at EMBL (30Rost B. Sander C. J. Mol.

Proteins. 1994; 19: 55-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (1342) Google Scholar) and a Blast search against Prodom domain data base was run (32Corpet F. Gouzy J. Kahn D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 323-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). MacMolly Tetra Program by Gene Soft was also used to compare the nucleotide sequences of H1° and H3.3 mRNAs. The MBP/PIPPin fusion protein was expressed in E. coli and purified from crude bacterial extract by affinity chromatography on amylose resin (New England BioLabs). White New Zealand female rabbits were injected subcutaneously with 80 μg of fusion protein, emulsified in complete Freund's adjuvant. Subsequent injections were done with 40 μg of protein, in incomplete Freund's adjuvant. The first boost was given 2 weeks after the first one and 4 injections more were given at 2-week intervals. After removing the blood clot, preimmune and immune sera were aliquoted, frozen, and stored at −80 °C. Specific anti-PIPPin and anti-MBP IgG fractions were obtained from total serum by two-step affinity chromatography. Briefly, IgG directed against the fusion protein were first immunoabsorbed on the fusion protein, bound to CnBr-activated Sepharose 4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biochem) and eluted from the column with 100 mm glycine-HCl (pH 2.5). In the second step, anti-MBP antibodies were removed from the IgG fraction, obtained in the first step, by chromatography on MBP-Sepharose. The fraction not bound by the column is enriched in anti-PIPPin antibodies, while bound anti-MBP IgGs were eluted with 100 mm glycine-HCl (pH 2.5). All the purified fractions were dialyzed against PBS and stored at −20 °C. Total RNA from cultured neurons was isolated, according to Chomczynsky and Sacchi (33Chomczynsky P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63232) Google Scholar), and separated by electrophoresis on 1.5% agarose, 6% formaldehyde gels. RNA was then transferred to nylon membranes (Hybond, Amersham) and hybridized to 32P-labeled PIPPin probe, as already described (19Castiglia D. Scaturro M. Nastasi T. Cestelli A. Di Liegro I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 218: 390-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Proteins (30–50 μg of total or fractionated cell extracts) were separated by electrophoresis on denaturing 15% polyacrylamide slab gels (SDS-PAGE), and immunoblotted as described elsewhere (23Savettieri G. Mazzola G.A. Rodriguez Sanchez M.B. Caruso G. Di Liegro I. Cestelli A. Cell. Mol. Neurobiol. 1998; 18: 369-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Two-dimensional electrophoretic analysis was performed as described by Roccheri et al. (34Roccheri M.C. Cascino D. Giudice G. J. Submicrosc. Cytol. Pathol. 1993; 25: 173-179PubMed Google Scholar), with isoelectrophocusing (IEF) in the 5–7 pH range, in the first dimension, and SDS-PAGE in the second dimension. The pH gradient profile of IEF was determined by using proteins of known pI as standards. Plasmids were linearized by restriction with suitable enzymes which cut the vectors downstream to the inserts, and used as templates for in vitro transcription of either unlabeled or32P-labeled H1°, H3.3, and c-erbAα2 transcripts, from the T3 (pMH1° and pH1°d) or T7 (pDH3, pR4, pM4, pH1°a, pH1°b, pH1°c, and pA1.3K) RNA polymerase promoters, according to Promega instructions. T1 protection assays were carried out as described elsewhere (24Scaturro M. Nastasi T. Raimondi L. Bellafiore M. Cestelli A. Di Liegro I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22788-22791Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). To identify any H3.3 RNA binding activity, recognizable as PIPPin, in vivo postnuclear or nuclear cell fractions (up to 1 mg of total proteins) were incubated with 5.0 × 106 cpm of labeled H3.3 RNA and subjected to T1 assay. The putative PIPPin-RNA covalent complexes were then immunoprecipitated from the mixture with anti-PIPPin antibodies. To immunoprecipitate putative PIPPin-RNA covalent complexes, obtained by T1 protection assay, the cell lysates were incubated with 10 μl of preimmune serum to remove aspecific binding (preclearing step). After 20 min on ice, 20 μl of Protein A-Sepharose (Sigma), in T1 buffer (TB : 15 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm KCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol), were added and incubation was prolonged for 2 h more, under moderate shaking, at room temperature. After removing the Sepharose, precleared lysates were further incubated for 2–4 h with the immune (total or fractionated) anti-PIPPin serum. Sepharose from both steps was washed with 100 volumes of TB and finally boiled for 5 min in SDS-PAGE buffer. Neurons were cultured on laminin-coated glass coverslips for 5 days. Cells were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde, in PBS, at room temperature, for 15 min and then permeabilized for 5 min with 0.05% Triton X-100, in PBS. For the contemporary staining of both microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP-2) and PIPPin, neurons were incubated with mouse monoclonal anti-MAP2 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and rabbit anti-PIPPin serum (total or fractionated), in PBS, for 1 h at room temperature, in a wet chamber. The secondary antibodies were, respectively, anti-mouse IgG, conjugated to rhodamine (Promega), and goat anti-rabbit IgG, conjugated to fluoresceine (Promega), diluted, for use, in PBS (1:75). Cells were examined in an Olympus BX-50 microscope equipped with Vario Cam B/W camera, and elaborated by image-pro/plus Media Cybernetics. We reported in a previous paper (19Castiglia D. Scaturro M. Nastasi T. Cestelli A. Di Liegro I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 218: 390-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) that PIPPin contains two regions (PIP-1 and PIP-2, in Fig.1) with chemical homology to double-stranded RNA-binding motifs. A more recent search in the data bases revealed that, in the central part (residues 70–116) of PIPPin sequence (Fig. 1), a putative CSD is also present. The alignment of this domain with those present in a number of other eukaryotic, as well as prokaryotic, nucleic acid-binding proteins shows that the most conserved portions are the RNP1 and RNP2 motifs. Interestingly, the region in between these motifs shows higher homology to the prokaryotic than to the eukaryotic proteins, on the basis of amino acid identity. Moreover, according to protein structure prediction (not shown), PIPPin would show the highest structural homology with E. coli CspA, that seems to be a general chaperone for RNA. Like in the other eukaryotic proteins, however, the CSD of PIPPin is flanked on both sides by additional putative RNA-binding domains. These preliminary findings suggested that PIPPin was an RNA-binding protein. That this is the case was then clearly shown by the fact that a MBP-PIPPin fusion protein (Fig. 2, lane 1), but not MBP alone (Fig. 2, lane C), protected the radioactive H3.3 RNA, transcribed in vitro, from nucleolytic degradation by T1 RNase. The radioactive RNA-protein complex shows an apparent molecular mass of about 84 kDa, that is about 24 kDa more than MBP/PIPPin fusion protein (i.e. about 60 kDa). As the exceeding mass has to be attributed probably to RNA, we can hypothesize that about 80 nucleotides of RNA are bound. The above results demonstrated that PIPPin did bind RNA. We then asked whether it shows any preference for the message encoding H3.3 histone. Competition experiments showed that, among those tested, only unlabeled H3.3 (Fig. 2, lane 2) and H1° (lane 3) transcripts, but not the brain-specific c-erbAα2 (lane 4) RNA, were able to compete with radioactive H3.3 transcripts, when present in the binding mixture. Thus PIPPin recognizes specifically some feature, common to RNAs encoding H1° and H3.3 histone variants. The alignment of H1° and H3.3 cDNAs revealed the presence, downstream to the coding regions of the two inserts, of a number of sites with moderate to high sequence homology. One region, in particular, shows high similarity (Fig.3 A); interestingly, this sequence of about 40 nucleotides covers in both messages the terminal portion of the 3′-UTR, encompassing the polyadenylation signal (underlined in the figure). Moreover, the same region is part of a sequence that was previously suggested by us to be potentially able to form a stem-loop structure, highly conserved in vertebrate H3.3 mRNAs (Ref. 5Castiglia D. Cestelli A. Scaturro M. Nastasi T. Di Liegro I. Neurochem. Res. 1994; 19: 1531-1537Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar and Fig. 3 A). To investigate the possible involvement of this region in binding PIPPin, we amplified and cloned different fragments of the original H1° and H3.3 inserts (Fig.3 B) and used these new plasmids as templates to synthesize a set of unlabeled competitor RNAs. As shown in Fig. 3 C, all the unlabeled RNAs that contain the very end of the 3′-UTR of both H1° (Fig. 3 C, lane H1°, d) and H3.3 RNAs (Fig.3 C, all the lanes marked as H3.3) are able to abolish binding. These data confirm that PIPPin binds specifically to the 3′ end of both H1° and H3.3 RNAs, as we hypothesized on the basis of H1° and H3.3 sequence alignment. As a first step toward identification of PIPPin in vivo, we prepared antibodies directed against the MBP/PIPPin fusion protein. We then used the total serum from immunized rabbit or PIPPin-specific purified antibodies to study the expression of PIPPin during brain development and its intracellular localization. We identified a main band (30 kDa), the concentration of which increases at birth (P0) and keeps thereafter an almost constant level (Fig.4 A), thus showing a behavior similar to the one reported for PIPPin mRNA (19Castiglia D. Scaturro M. Nastasi T. Cestelli A. Di Liegro I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 218: 390-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.4 B, the band is enriched in the postmicrosomal cytosolic fraction, suggesting that PIPPin is not anchored to cytoskeletal or membrane structures. PIPPin is also present in brain nuclear extracts (see below). We asked next if PIPPin is expressed in isolated neurons. Therefore, we prepared neurons from embryonic day 16 rat cerebral cortices, and cultured them in a selective, serum-free medium (22Cestelli A. Savettieri G. Ferraro D. Vitale F. Dev. Brain Res. 1985; 22: 219-227Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar) on laminin (23Savettieri G. Mazzola G.A. Rodriguez Sanchez M.B. Caruso G. Di Liegro I. Cestelli A. Cell. Mol. Neurobiol. 1998; 18: 369-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). After 5 (L5) or 8 (L8) days of culture, either total RNA or nuclear and postnuclear extracts were prepared from neurons. As shown in Fig.5 A, PIPPin mRNA is highly expressed in isolated neurons. Accordingly, the 30-kDa protein was evidenced, by Western analysis, in nuclear and postnuclear extracts from both cultured neurons (Fig. 5 B, lanes L5, N and Pn), and brain (Fig. 5 B, lanes P10, N, and Pn). A minor immunoreactive band (about 20 kDa) was sometimes evidenced when purified anti-PIPPin antibodies were used in the Western analyses (Fig. 4); the origin of this band, that was not visible when we used total anti-MBP/PIPPin serum (see, for example, Fig. 5 B) is not yet clear. Similar to the results shown above, staining of PIPPin by immunofluorescence localizes the protein to both nucleus and cytoplasm, in cultured neurons. The nuclear staining is especially intense in the largest cells present in the culture. One neuron, representative of this population, is shown in Fig. 6 (Fig.6, B and C, PIPPin immunostaining). In the same cell, the MAP-2 clearly shows (Fig. 6, A and C) the expected cytoplasmic localization (35Craig A.M. Banker G. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1994; 17: 267-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar). Moreover, the spotted appearance of immunofluorescence in the nucleus suggests possible involvement of the protein in discrete intranuclear macromolecular complexes and/or association to the nuclear pores. To investigate whether histone RNA-PIPPin complexes could be actually formed in cell extracts, we first performed T1 RNase protection assay and tried then to immunoprecipitate specifically the putative PIPPin-RNA complexes. As shown in Fig. 7, a number of radioactive bands were evidenced when H3.3 RNA was incubated with either postnuclear (Fig. 7 A, lane 1) or nuclear (Fig. 7 A, lane 2) brain extracts; among these bands, however, only a major one, with apparent mass of about 54 kDa, was immunoprecipitated by anti-PIPPin antibodies (Fig. 7 B). The apparent mass of the observed band is about 24 kDa larger than the 30-kDa PIPPin band. The difference in size between PIPPin and the putative PIPPin-RNA covalent complex is thus exactly the same observed in the case of the complex formed by the MBP/PIPPin fusion protein (shown for internal reference in Fig. 7 A, lane 3). Interestingly, the 54-kDa complex is more concentrated in the nuclear (Fig. 7 B, lane 2) than in the postnuclear extract (Fig.7 B, lane 1). Since PIPPin is present in both compartments, in order to explain this difference in its RNA binding activity, we hypothesized that this latter might be modulated by post-translational modification. With the aim of exploring this possibility, we performed two-dimensional electrophoresis and Western analysis, on both postnuclear and nuclear cell extracts. Fig.8 shows typical results of these experiments. As expected, both fractions contain PIPPin: immunoreactive 30-kDa species were indeed clearly evidenced after the second-dimension, SDS-PAGE. However, in the first-dimension, IEF separation, cytoplasmic (Fig. 8 A) and nuclear (Fig.8 B) PIPPin show different behaviors; cytoplasmic PIPPin is essentially present as a main form with a pI ≥ 7 (i.e. the expected pI for unmodified protein). On the other hand, a high proportion (one-half or more) of nuclear PIPPin accumulates in a region of the gel that roughly corresponds to pH 6.0. This finding suggests that a high proportion of PIPPin might be post-translationally modified in the nucleus (presumably by phosphorylation) in order to bind RNA. Among the proteins synthesized in the maturing brain, differentiation-associated variants of both linker (such as H1°) and core histones (such as H3.3) are of great interest, as their entering chromatin may induce further modifications of the transcriptional potential of the genome, in the absence of DNA replication and cell division. It is thus most important to understand how the synthesis of these proteins is regulated in the developing brain and especially in postmitotic neurons. Growing evidence demonstrates the importance of regulating mRNA localization, stability, and translation, in control of gene expression, both in development and differentiated cells (for reviews, see Refs. 10Oleynikov Y. Singer R.H. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 381-383Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 36Jacobson A. Peltz S.W. Annu. Rev.

The signals responsible for specific regulation of mRNA metabolism reside in the RNA message itself (38Steward O. Wallace C.S. Lyford G.L. Worley P.F. Neuron. 1998; 21: 741-751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar). All transcripts contain variable lengths of untranslated sequences where there are binding sites for a number of RNA-binding proteins. Many RNA-binding proteins probably assemble on the message at the moment of transcription (16Burd C.G. Dreyfuss G. Science. 1994; 265: 615-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (1734) Google Scholar, 17Siomi H. Dreyfuss G. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1997; 7: 345-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar) and are determinant for the future fate of the transcript itself (7Matsumoto K. Wassarman K.M. Wolffe A.P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2107-2121Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Among the several classes of RNA-binding proteins identified to date, CSD-containing proteins (also called Y-box proteins: see Refs. 20Graumann P.L. Marahiel M.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 286-290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar and 21Matsumoto K. Wolffe A.P. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 318-323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar) form an increasingly large family, the members of which interact with both DNA and RNA to control transcription and/or translation of specific genes (21Matsumoto K. Wolffe A.P. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 318-323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). In the eubacterial domain, CSD proteins function mainly as RNA chaperones, a role that is gaining increasing attention, as it is now clear that many RNAs misfold or even unfold, in the absence of protein collaborators, which seem to be required also for the formation of large functional RNA-protein complexes (32Corpet F. Gouzy J. Kahn D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 323-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Like “protein chaperones,” most “RNA chaperones” are, however, nonspecific general factors. An interesting feature of PIPPin is, on the contrary, its specificity for the messengers encoding histones H1° and H3.3. Now, although PIPPin would show the highest structural homology with E. coli CspA, that seems in fact to be a general chaperone for RNA, its CSD, similar to other Y-box eukaryotic proteins, is flanked on both sides by other putative RNA-binding domains (PIP1 and PIP2). We do not know yet if selectivity of PIPPin depends on CSD, on the two flanking domains, or on the particular combination of all these domains, but the present finding is important for at least two reasons. First, it offers an example of a tissue-specific RNA-binding factor that is also specific for one single class of messages. Second, it is quite clear that, in maturing brain, accumulation of the histone variants H1° and H3.3 is regulated mainly at the post-transcriptional level (6Scaturro M. Cestelli A. Castiglia D. Nastasi T. Di Liegro I. Neurochem. Res. 1995; 20: 969-976Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). However, it remains unresolved how this control is effected. Our previous studies (24Scaturro M. Nastasi T. Raimondi L. Bellafiore M. Cestelli A. Di Liegro I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22788-22791Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) have established that factors, specific for the H1° message, are actually present in the developing brain. We show here that, in addition to those factors, H1° mRNA can also bind PIPPin, that is able to recognize H3.3 mRNA too. Taken together, the previous and present results suggest that post-transcriptional regulation of histone variants may rely on a pool of proteins, some of which are highly specific for a single message, whereas others (like PIPPin) might recognize features shared by different members of the same target group, ensuring their coordinated utilization. In this sense, an interesting finding is that PIPPin binds both H1° and H3.3 RNAs at the very end of the 3′-UTRs, which comprise the putative polyadenylation signals, suggesting that polyadenylation might be affected, in vivo. Although we do not yet have evidence of such a role, the presence of PIPPin in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus of nerve cells suggests that the protein might accompany histone messages from transcription to translation, participating possibly, as suggested by the spotted appearance of the nuclear staining, in the formation of till unknown, histone RNA-specific, macromolecular nuclear complexes. Finally, with the goal of identifying RNA-binding PIPPin in vivo, we used the anti-PIPPin antibodies in an attempt to immunoprecipitate putative covalent H3.3 RNA-PIPPin complexes from nuclear and postnuclear brain extracts. In principle, this approach might be quite hard, as it has been suggested (18Weeks K.M. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1997; 7: 336-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) that when RNA molecules form specific complexes with proteins, both partners (RNAs as well as proteins) undergo structural modifications (induced fit) that might hamper recognition of the protein component by antibodies; moreover, the presence of other protein- and/or RNA-binding factors might have a further masking effect. Despite these considerations, we did immunoprecipitate radioactive, covalent complexes, even if with apparently low efficiency. Interestingly, although immunoreactive PIPPin is present in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, the concentration of PIPPin-RNA complexes is much higher in the nuclear extracts. In order to explain this finding we are forced to suppose that the protein undergoes some activating modification in the nucleus. As there are six protein kinase C and three casein kinase II potential phosphorylation sites in its amino acid sequence, we hypothesized that nuclear RNA binding activity might depend on PIPPin phosphorylation. This hypothesis was supported by the finding that a significant proportion of nuclear PIPPin is more acidic than expected. Thus, it is possible that PIPPin must be phosphorylated in order to bind RNA with high affinity. Although not definitively proved, the suggestion that PIPPin activity might be modulated by post-translational modification is stimulating, because it implies that histone mRNA-PIPPin binding (and the consequent, till unknown, effects of this binding on histone mRNA metabolism) might be regulated, in neurons, by extracellular stimuli, such as hormones and neurotransmitters. Modifications in the rate of histone variant synthesis and perhaps of their incorporation into chromatin might then cause modifications of the structural organization and the transcription potential of neuronal chromatin.

Therefore the fruit fly as a model organism is a prime candidate in the attempt to clarify the role of calpains in vivo.The finding of Drosophila CALPA was preceded by biochemical studies which revealed the existence of at least two calpain isoforms in the fruit fly (15Pintér M. Friedrich P. Biochem. J. 1988; 253: 467-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Another calpain isoform, CANP (probably distinct from the two partially purified ones), has been purified to homogeneity (16Pintér M. Stierandova A. Friedrich P. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 8201-8206Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). However, none of the genes encoding these proteins have yet been found. The only Drosophila calpain cDNA cloned so far is coding for the CALPA protein (5Emori Y. Saigo K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25137-25142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Theopold U.

The protein is expressed in a few tissues, including some cells in the brain, midgut, and embryo. It carries a unique insertion sequence in the calmodulin-like domain with a 16-amino acid long putative membrane-anchoring region in it. Otherwise, its domain structure (domain I, regulatory propeptide; domain II, Cys-protease; domain III, putative regulatory; domain IV, Ca2+ binding) and sequence are similar to that of conventional vertebrate calpains except for the N-terminal region of domain I which shows no homology to any other protein sequence. No small subunit, associated with CALPA or the purified CANP protein has been found in line with evolutionary studies which suggest the lack of the small subunit from protostomes (17Jékely G. Friedrich P. J. Mol. Evol. 1999; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). The CALPA protein has been expressed in E. coli and purified partially, and some of its possible in vivo substrates have been identified (18Amano S. Kawasaki H. Ishiura S. Kawashima S. Suzuki K. Emori Y. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1997; 122: 865-871Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). However, apart from these studies, no biochemical data are available on the mechanism of action of Drosophila calpains with known sequences.Here we describe the sequence of a novel fruit fly calpain, CALPB, and the bacterial expression, purification, and enzymological characterization of Drosophila CALPA and CALPB. The recombinant proteins worked as active, Ca2+-dependent proteinases. A detailed study is presented on the activation, autolysis, and lipid dependence of these proteins. The parallel nature of the enzymes' autolysis and activation and the lack of the activation period in the fully autolyzed enzyme provide insights into the mechanism of calpain activation. The Ca2+-dependent intracellular cysteine proteinases, calpains, are important regulators of many cellular pathways (1Molinari M. Carafoli E. J. Membr.

Invertebrate calpain homologs have also been described, including a Schistosoma mansoni calpain (10Andresen K. Tom T.D. Strand M. J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W2083131603,"In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, heat shock stress induces a variety of cellular responses including a transient cell cycle arrest before G1/S transition. Previous studies have suggested that this G1 delay is probably attributable to a reduced level of the G1 cyclin gene (CLN1 and CLN2) transcripts. Here we report our finding that the G1 cyclin Cln3 and the S cyclin Clb5 are the key factors required for recovery from heat shock-induced G1 arrest. Heat shock treatment of G1 cells lacking either CLN3 or CLB5/CLB6 functions leads to prolonged cell cycle arrest before the initiation of DNA synthesis, concomitant with a severe deficiency in bud formation. The inability of the clb5 clb6 mutant to resume normal budding after heat shock treatment is unanticipated, since the S phase cyclins are generally thought to be required mainly for initiation of DNA synthesis and have no significant roles in bud formation in the presence of functional G1cyclins. Further studies reveal that the accumulation of G1cyclin transcripts is markedly delayed in the clb5 clb6 mutant following heat shock treatment, indicating that the CLN gene expression may require Clb5/Clb6 to attain a threshold level for driving the cell cycle through G1/S transition. Consistent with this assumption, overproduction of Clb5 greatly enhances the transcription of at least two G1cyclin genes (CLN1 and CLN2) in heat-shocked G1 cells. These results suggest that Clb5 may positively regulate the expression of G1 cyclins during cellular recovery from heat shock-induced G1 arrest. Additional evidence is presented to support a role for Clb5 in maintaining the synchrony between budding and DNA synthesis during normal cell division as well.

Heat shock treatment of yeast cells, for instance, induces several observable responses including a reprogramming of gene expression, acquisition of thermotolerance, and a transient cell cycle arrest at G1 (1Craig E.A. Jones E.W. Pringle J.R. Broach J.R. The Molecular and Cellular Biology of the Yeast Saccharomyces: Gene Expression. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1992: 501-537Google Scholar, 5Barnes C.A. Johnston G.C. Singer R.A. J.

Matsumoto K. Iida H. Uno I. Ishikawa T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 244-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The reprogramming of gene expression allows biased synthesis of proteins and metabolites with protective functions against the heat insult. An important group of proteins that are induced to high levels immediately after heat exposure in yeast as well as other organisms is known to be the heat shock proteins, which act as molecular chaperones to help minimize the detrimental effects of protein denaturation caused by heat shock treatment (3Lindquist S. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1992; 2: 748-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 8Georgopoulos C. Welch W.J. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1993; 9: 601-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (1002) Google Scholar, 9Hendricks J.P. Hartl F.U. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 349-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (1477) Google Scholar, 10Parsell D.A.

Nature. 1994; 372: 475-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (742) Google Scholar). The heat shock-induced reprogramming of gene expression also results in a temporal reduction in the expression of proteins whose functions are not in immediate need for thermotolerance acquisition. This down-regulation of gene expression may be the reason behind the transient cell cycle arrest at G1 in yeast cells, since two G1 cyclin genes required for G1/S transition, CLN1 and CLN2, are found to be repressed after heat shock treatment (12Rowley A. Johnston G.C. Butler B. Werner-Washburne M. Singer R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1034-1041Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). A stress-inducible protein, Xbp1, has been proposed to function in the repression of gene expression following heat shock treatment (13Mai B. Breeden L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6491-6501Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Apart from down-regulating the expression of many genes, heat shock stress is also believed to result in a down-regulation of the cyclic AMP (cAMP)-Ras pathway (7Shin D.Y. Matsumoto K. Iida H. Uno I. Ishikawa T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 244-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 14Attfield P.V. Nat. Biotech. 1997; 15: 1351-1357Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar), which may affect cell cycle progression through the G1 cyclin Cln3 (15Hall D.D. Markwardt D.D. Parviz F. Heideman W. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4370-4378Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The heat shock-induced G1 arrest in yeast lasts for a period of approximately 1 h (7Shin D.Y. Matsumoto K. Iida H. Uno I. Ishikawa T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 244-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Once the heat shock proteins are induced and thermotolerance is acquired, the normal cell cycle resumes. Normal cell cycle progression in yeast relies on sequential activation of the cyclin-dependent kinase Cdc28 by the cell cycle stage-specific cyclins (16Futcher B. Yeast. 1996; 12: 1635-1646Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 17Lew D.J. Weinert T. Pringle J.R. Pringle J.R. Broach J.R. Jones E.W.

G1/S transition, often referred to as START, is dependent on three G1 cyclins: Cln1, Cln2, and Cln3 (16Futcher B. Yeast. 1996; 12: 1635-1646Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 17Lew D.J. Weinert T. Pringle J.R. Pringle J.R. Broach J.R. Jones E.W. The Molecular and Cellular Biology of the Yeast Saccharomyces: Cell Cycle and Cell Biology.

Cln3 is particularly important, since it controls the expression of other G1 cyclins, as well as Clb5 and Clb6, two S phase cyclins required for initiation of DNA synthesis (20Stuart D. Wittenberg C. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2780-2794Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 21Tyers M. Tokiwa G. Futcher B. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1955-1968Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). By a yet unknown mechanism, Cln3 activates the transcription factor SBF, which is composed of the Swi4 and Swi6 proteins (22Dirick L. Bohm T. Nasmyth K. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4803-4813Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar, 23Koch C. Moll T. Neuberg M. Ahorn H. Nasmyth K. Science. 1993; 261: 1551-1557Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar, 24Nasmyth K. Dirick L. Cell. 1991; 66: 995-1013Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). SBF in turn drives the transcription of a set of genes including CLN1 and CLN2, leading to execution of START and budding (22Dirick L. Bohm T. Nasmyth K. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4803-4813Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar, 23Koch C. Moll T. Neuberg M. Ahorn H. Nasmyth K. Science. 1993; 261: 1551-1557Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar, 24Nasmyth K. Dirick L. Cell. 1991; 66: 995-1013Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). In a parallel fashion, Cln3 is also thought to activate another transcription factor MBF, consisting of Mbp1 and Swi6, which then stimulates expression of the genes involved in DNA synthesis including CLB5 and CLB6 (22Dirick L. Bohm T. Nasmyth K. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4803-4813Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar, 23Koch C. Moll T. Neuberg M. Ahorn H. Nasmyth K. Science. 1993; 261: 1551-1557Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). Thus, the cyclin cascade initiated by Cln3 sets in motion two parallel cell cycle events downstream of START, i.e. budding and DNA replication, each controlled by a pair of functionally overlapping cyclins. Although G1 cyclin functions are sufficient for passage of START and bud formation, the initiation of DNA replication cannot properly take place without the functions of Clb5/Clb6. Loss of Clb5/Clb6 functions results in a delay in initiation of DNA synthesis but has no effects on the timing of bud emergence (25Schwob E. Nasmyth K. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1160-1175Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar), suggesting that Clb5/Clb6 are principally required for DNA synthesis control. Under special conditions, however, Clb5 has been shown to be more versatile, capable of performing some overlapping functions with the G1 cyclins. Overproduction of Clb5, for example, can rescue the lethality of the cln1 cln2 cln3 triple mutant (26Epstein C.B. Cross F.R. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 1695-1706Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). Similarly, elevation of the Clb5 activity through inactivation of Sic1, an inhibitor of the Clb5-Cdc28 kinase, also suppresses the START deficiency in the cln1 cln2 cln3 triple mutant (27Schneider B.L. Yang Q.H. Futcher A.B. Science. 1996; 272: 560-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 28Tyers M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7772-7776Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that, although Clb5 normally is not required for execution of START and budding, it is able to provide these functions if its activity is sufficiently increased. In the present study, the roles of various cyclins in the recovery of cell cycle from heat shock-induced G1 arrest have been examined. Our results suggest that Clb5 is one of the key factors required for this process. Clb5 facilitates the cell cycle recovery following heat shock by promoting initiation of DNA replication on one hand and positively regulating the expression of the G1cyclin genes to promote budding on the other. All yeast strains used in this study were derived from the wild type strain W303 and are listed in Table I. The rad24 and cln1 cln3 mutants were originally obtained from U. Surana and I. Herskowitz, respectively. YUS454 (cln1 cln2 cln3) contains the CLN3 gene under control of the methionine-repressible MET3 promoter for viability.

To generate the plasmids pMC229–233, polymerase chain reaction-amplified coding regions of CLN2, CLN3, CLB3, CLB5, and CLB6 were cloned individually into a centromere vector under control of the GAL1 promoter containing URA3 as a selectable marker. The plasmids pMC234 and pMC235 were generated by fusing the coding regions of CLN2 and CLN3 with GAL1 in a centromere vector containing the LEU2 gene.Table IIPlasmidsNameConstructpMC229GAL1-CLN2, URA3, yeast centromere vectorpMC230GAL1-CLN3, URA3, yeast centromere vectorpMC231GAL1-CLB5, URA3, yeast centromere vectorpMC232GAL1-CLB6, URA3, yeast centromere vectorpMC233GAL1-CLB3, URA3, yeast centromere vectorpMC234GAL1-CLN2, LEU2, yeast centromere vectorpMC235GAL1-CLN3, LEU2, yeast centromere vector Open table in a new tab Gene disruptions were performed using the one-step replacement method (32Rothstein R. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 281-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (1105) Google Scholar). The CLN2 gene was disrupted by replacing its 1.3-kb1 Xho I–Nco I fragment by URA3 in wild type and a cln1 mutant to generate YMC432 and YMC434, respectively. The CLB3 gene was disrupted by replacing the 1-kb Hpa I–Bgl II fragment by HIS3, and the CLB4 gene was disrupted by replacing the 0.5-kb Stu I–Spe I fragment by TRP1. YMC404 (clb3Δ::HIS3 clb4Δ::TRP1) was generated by two consecutive disruptions. Similarly, YMC406 (clb5Δ::URA3 clb6Δ::TRP1) was made by consecutive disruptions of CLB5, whose 1-kb Pvu I–Fok I fragment was replaced by URA3, and CLB6, whose 0.9-kb Bst XI–Xba I fragment was replaced by TRP1. Overnight cultures were diluted to an A600 of 0.1 and were allowed to grow at 25 °C to an A600 of 0.3. At this point, α-factor was added to a final concentration of 5 μg/ml. When greater than 95% cells had been arrested in G1, the cultures were divided into two halves, with one shifted to 42 °C for 30 min and another remaining at 25 °C. The cells were then washed by filtration and resuspended in fresh medium at 25 °C. Samples taken at intervals were used for analysis of cell morphology, DNA content, and Northern blotting. In experiments where the expression of a gene was driven by the GAL1 promoter, the cells were first grown in medium containing raffinose as the sole carbon source. The cells were synchronized in G1 as described above. Galactose was then added to 2% to induce the gene expression for 15 min at 25 °C before being subjected to heat shock treatment. After α-factor was removed by filtration, the cells were resuspended in fresh medium containing raffinose and galactose and incubated at 25 °C. Samples were collected at intervals for further analysis. In experiments showing that CLB5 overexpression overrides α-factor-induced G1 arrest, the G1-arrested cells were split into two parts with galactose added to one of them, and both cultures were continuously incubated with α-factor. Total RNA was isolated as described by Cross and Tinkelenberg (33Cross F.R. Tinkelenberg A.H. Cell. 1991; 65: 875-883Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar), and Northern blot analyses were performed as described by Price et al. (34Price C. Nasmyth K. Schuster T. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 218: 543-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). To show RNA signals of various genes on the same blot, the DNA probes used earlier on RNA blot were stripped by heating at 80 °C for 30 min in a solution containing 0.1% SDS, 1 μm EDTA, and 10 μmTris-HCl (pH 7.2). After washing briefly in H2O, the blot was hybridized with another 32P-labeled probe. The RNA levels were quantitated with a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA). Previous studies on yeast cell cycle response to heat shock treatment were performed with asynchronous cell populations (12Rowley A. Johnston G.C. Butler B. Werner-Washburne M. Singer R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1034-1041Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). To better assess the duration of the G1 arrest period and the kinetics of the recovery, we used mating pheromone (α-factor)-synchronized cells for examination of their response to heat shock treatment. Wild type cells were synchronized by α-factor and divided into two halves with one shifted to 42 °C for 30 min, while another remained at 25 °C, followed by washing and resuspension in fresh medium devoid of the mating pheromone. As shown in Fig. 1, cells that had been exposed to high temperature initiated DNA replication and budding at a later time point than those that were not treated with heat shock. The delay was about 60 min (Fig. 1). This result confirms the previous finding that the cell cycle arrest induced by heat shock is prior to START, since budding and DNA replication were both delayed (12Rowley A. Johnston G.C. Butler B. Werner-Washburne M. Singer R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1034-1041Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). It is well known that another type of stress, DNA damage, also induces cell cycle arrest in yeast, which is mediated through a control mechanism termed “checkpoint” (35Hartwell L.H. Weinert T.A. Science. 1989; 246: 629-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (2431) Google Scholar, 36Hartwell L.H. Kastan M.B. Science. 1994; 266: 1821-1828Crossref PubMed Scopus (2316) Google Scholar). The checkpoint genes such as RAD9 and RAD24 have been shown to be required for the transient cell cycle arrest at G1 caused by DNA damage (37Siede W. Friedberg A.S. Dianova I. Friedberg E.C. Genetics. 1994; 138: 271-281Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To test whether the DNA damage checkpoint also functions in the G1 arrest caused by heat shock treatment, we examined the cell cycle response to heat shock stress in the rad9 and rad24 mutants. As shown in Fig. 1, both mutants exhibited a G1 arrest that lasted about 60 min, similar to the wild type cells, suggesting that the cell cycle arrest after heat shock is not mediated through DNA damage checkpoint genes. Decrease in the CLN1 and CLN2 transcript levels has been suggested as a possible cause of the cell cycle arrest in heat shock-treated cells (12Rowley A. Johnston G.C. Butler B. Werner-Washburne M. Singer R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1034-1041Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). We therefore examined various cyclin mutants for their response to heat shock treatment. Cells lacking CLN2 responded to heat shock treatment with a G1arrest and recovered 60 min later, as did wild type cells (Fig.2). The cln1 mutant behaved similarly (data not shown). Deletion of both CLN1 and CLN2 genes caused a further delay of 30 min (Fig. 2). Nevertheless, the double mutant resumed cell cycle and divided normally after the 90-min delay (Fig. 2 and data not shown). Remarkably, the cln3 mutant failed to recover from the heat shock-induced G1 arrest for at least 5 h (Fig. 2). The mutant cells showed no sign of DNA replication and virtually no bud formation during the entire period of the experiment (Fig. 2). The failure of the cln3 mutant to initiate DNA replication and budding was not because the mutant was particularly sensitive to the heat treatment, since the cln3 cell viability was not significantly affected by the heat shock treatment (data not shown). This result indicates that CLN3 is essential for cell recovery from heat shock-induced G1 arrest. A similar defect in recovery from the arrest was also observed in the clb5 clb6 double mutant except, in this case, the budding defect was less pronounced than that of the cln3 cells (Fig. 2). Nevertheless, the clb5 clb6 double mutant displayed a conspicuous budding defect after heat shock. 2 h after release from synchronization, for example, only 26% of the double mutant cells were budded, compared with over 50% in the populations of either the wild type or any of the cln1, cln2, clb5, and clb6 single mutants (Fig. 2, and data not shown). Furthermore, the budded cell population of the double mutant was limited to about 50% for at least 5 h (Fig. 2). It is evident, therefore, that the clb5 clb6 mutant was unable to recover from the heat shock-induced G1 arrest for a rather prolonged period. Both cln3 and clb5 clb6 mutants eventually resumed normal division without showing significant reductions in their viability (data not shown). In comparison, the clb3 clb4 double mutant, defective in another pair of S phase cyclins, Clb3/Clb4, (25Schwob E. Nasmyth K. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1160-1175Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar, 38Fitch I. Dahmann C. Surana U. Amon A. Goetsch L. Byers B. Futcher B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 3: 805-818Crossref Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 39Richardson H.E. Lew D.J. Henze M. Sugimoto K. Reed S.I. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 2021-2034Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar), exhibited no defect in recovery from the G1 arrest (Fig. 2). The severe defect in recovery from heat shock-induced G1 arrest exhibited by the cln3 mutant is, by and large, within expectations, since this cyclin is the crucial factor in promoting the initiation of bud formation and DNA replication. However, the inability of the clb5 clb6 double mutant to resume normal budding was unexpected, because the Clb5/Clb6 cyclins are thought to be required mainly for DNA synthesis and not for bud formation when functional G1 cyclins are present (25Schwob E. Nasmyth K. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1160-1175Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). To seek an explanation for this finding, we tested whether the CLN transcript levels were affected in the double mutant. As shown in Fig. 3 a, the CLN1 and CLN2 transcripts in the untreated wild type cells accumulated to a peak level 30 min after release from synchronization, followed by periodic oscillations. In the heat shock-treated wild type cells, the CLN1 and CLN2 transcripts lagged 30–60 min before reaching the peak levels (Fig. 3 a). Similarly, the accumulation of the CLB5 transcript was also delayed, albeit to a lesser extent compared with that of CLN1 and CLN2 (Fig.3 a). The CLN3 transcript was present in α-factor-treated cells and appeared to be the least affected by heat shock treatment (Fig. 3 a). In contrast, the clb5 clb6 mutant displayed a marked reduction in all G1cyclin transcripts after heat shock treatment (Fig. 3 b). The CLN1 and CLN2 transcripts in clb5 clb6 cells did not reach levels comparable with those in the untreated cells until 180 min after release from G1 synchronization (Fig.3 b). The level of the CLN3 transcript was also decreased significantly in the mutant after heat exposure (Fig.3 b). The clb5 clb6 mutant, nevertheless, produced the ACT1 and SSA4 transcripts in a manner similar to wild type cells after heat exposure, indicating that the mutant was not defective in the general and heat shock-induced transcriptions (Fig. 3). These results together suggest that the Clb5/Clb6 cyclins are involved in the recovery of CLN transcript abundance in cells that have undergone heat shock treatment. The observation that the CLN transcript accumulation was delayed by heat shock treatment supports the notion that the cell cycle arrest following heat shock is attributable to the suboptimal level of G1 cyclin expression. Indeed, overexpression of CLN2 is able to abolish the G1 arrest induced by heat shock treatment in asynchronous cells (12Rowley A. Johnston G.C. Butler B. Werner-Washburne M. Singer R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1034-1041Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). To better understand the mechanisms of the heat shock-induced G1 arrest, we examined the effects of overexpression of other cyclin genes on cell cycle response to heat shock. The CLN2, CLN3, CLB5, and CLB3 genes were each placed under control of p GAL1, a strong inducible promoter, and introduced into wild type cells. After synchronization in G1 by α-factor in a raffinose-containing medium, galactose was added for 15 min to induce the cyclin gene expression, followed by heat shock and release to fresh medium containing galactose. As shown in Fig.4, overexpression of each CLN2, CLN3, and CLB5 completely eliminated the G1 arrest. The cyclin-overproducing cells displayed cell cycle kinetics after heat shock treatment comparable with those of untreated wild type cells, as judged by the FACScan pattern and budding profile (Fig. 4). In contrast, overexpression of two other S phase cyclin genes, CLB3 and CLB4, generated no effect on the G1 arrest after heat shock (Fig.4, and data not shown), an observation in agreement with the results presented in Fig. 2. It has been suggested that the G1 cyclins are the rate-limiting factors in G1 cells for passage of START (16Futcher B. Yeast. 1996; 12: 1635-1646Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The finding that heat shock stress failed to result in cell cycle arrest in CLN overexpression cells suggests the same for the heat shock-induced G1 arrest. Since the Clb5/Clb6 cyclins are not rate-limiting factors for START (25Schwob E. Nasmyth K. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1160-1175Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar), the ability of overexpressed CLB5 to negate the heat shock-induced G1 arrest is indicative of an indirect role for Clb5/Clb6 in START promotion, possibly as stimulators of the CLN gene transcription. This possibility was investigated by analyzing the CLN transcript abundance in cells overexpressing CLB5. As shown in Fig.5 a, CLB5 overexpression reversed the delay of CLN1 and CLN2 transcripts caused by heat shock, making them appear at the same time as in the wild type cells that experienced no heat shock stress (Fig. 5 a). CLN3 transcript levels were not significantly affected by CLB5 overexpression (Fig.5 a). Overexpression of another B-type cyclin gene (CLB3) had no effect on the CLN1 transcription at all (Fig. 5 b), consistent with the results described above, namely that neither the mutations nor the overexpression of the CLB3/CLB4 genes conferred any impact on heat shock-induced G1 arrest. It is noteworthy that both CLN1 and CLN2 transcripts retained a periodic expression pattern throughout the cell cycle in the CLB5 overexpression cells. The finding that CLB5 overexpression stimulated CLN1/CLN2 gene transcription led us to test whether an increase in Clb5 activity will bring about G1/S transition in cln3 cells that had endured heat shock stress. In the absence of heat shock treatment, CLB5 overexpression resulted in slight advancement in cell cycle progression in cln3 cells (Fig.6 a). Heat shock treatment of cln3 cells led to persistent cell cycle arrest at G1, which could be effectively negated by CLB5 overexpression (Fig. 6 a), suggesting that the defect of heat-treated cln3 mutant in carrying out G1/S transition is likely to be derived from insufficient CLN and CLB5 transcriptions. This was ascertained by examining the levels of CLN1, CLN2, and CLB5 transcripts in heat-treated cln3 cells. As shown in Fig.6 b, heat shock treatment strongly prevented the accumulation of CLN1/CLN2/CLB5 transcripts, and no transcripts were detected for these three cyclins until 180 min after release from synchronization.

One of these, the succinate-ubiquinone oxidoreductase (complex II or succinate dehydrogenase (SDH)1) donates electrons derived from its substrate, succinate, to the respiratory chain via the reduction of ubiquinone to ubiquinol. Generally, SDH is made up of two parts: a soluble catalytic dimer and a membrane domain (1Ackrell B.A.C. Johnson M.K. Gunsalus R.P. Cecchini G. Muller F. Chemistry and Biochemistry of Flavoenzymes.

In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the catalytic dimer is composed of the 67-kDa Sdh1p subunit, to which is attached a covalent FAD cofactor (6Chapman K.B. Solomon S.D. Boeke J.D.

Chem. 1990; 265: 10419-10423Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), in which are located three iron-sulfur clusters. The membrane-anchoring domain is composed of the two hydrophobic subunits, Sdh3p and Sdh4p, of 16.7 and 16.6 kDa, respectively (11Abraham P.R. Mulder A. van't Riet J. Raué H.A. Mol. Gen.

Each subunit is believed to have its amino terminus in the matrix and three transmembrane segments. The catalytic dimer can catalyze electron transfer from succinate to artificial electron acceptors, such as phenazine methosulfate (PMS), but not to the physiological acceptor, ubiquinone. The presence of the membrane domain anchors the catalytic dimer subunits to the inner membrane, restores ubiquinone reductase activity, and renders the enzyme sensitive to quinone analog inhibitors (1Ackrell B.A.C. Johnson M.K. Gunsalus R.P. Cecchini G. Muller F. Chemistry and Biochemistry of Flavoenzymes. III. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1992: 229-297Google Scholar, 3Hederstedt L. Ohnishi T. Ernster L. Molecular Mechanisms in Bioenergetics. Elsevier Science Publishers, New York1992: 163-197Google Scholar). Thus, the membrane domain is believed to contain at least one quinone-binding site. In the bovine heart mitochondrial SDH, quinone binding has been assigned to the QPs1 and QPs3 membrane domain subunits by cross-linking with photoaffinity analogs of ubiquinone (14Lee G.Y. He D.-Y., Yu, L. Yu C.-A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6193-6198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 15Shenoy S.K., Yu, L. Yu C.-A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17867-17872Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The quinone-binding site in the QPs1 subunit, which corresponds to Sdh3p, is localized in the matrix-facing loop connecting transmembrane segments II and III. The quinone-binding domain in QPs3, which corresponds to Sdh4p, is localized to the end of the first transmembrane segment toward the cytosolic side of the membrane (15Shenoy S.K., Yu, L. Yu C.-A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17867-17872Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 16Shenoy S.K., Yu, L. Yu C.-A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8717-8722Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). These results place the two quinone-binding sites on opposite sides of the membrane, consistent with a model formulated from inhibitor binding studies (17Yankovskaya V. Sablin S.O. Ramsay R.R. Singer T.P. Ackrell B.A.C. Cecchini G. Miyoshi H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21020-21024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Recently, photoaffinity labeling identified a ubiquinone-binding site in the Escherichia coli SdhC subunit, which corresponds to Sdh3p, near the cytoplasmic end of the first transmembrane segment (18Yang X., Yu, L. He D. Yu C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31916-31923Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The site contains serine 27 and arginine 31, which are necessary for succinate-ubiquinone reductase activity. It remains to be determined whether a second ubiquinone-binding site is present. The E. coli fumarate reductase, which uses electrons from menaquinol to reduce fumarate to succinate, is structurally and catalytically similar to the succinate-ubiquinone oxidoreductases (1Ackrell B.A.C. Johnson M.K. Gunsalus R.P. Cecchini G. Muller F. Chemistry and Biochemistry of Flavoenzymes. III. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1992: 229-297Google Scholar, 2Cole S.T. Condon C. Lemire B.D.

Hederstedt L. FEBS Lett. 1996; 389: 25-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Mutagenesis and inhibitor studies suggest that it contains two distinct quinone-binding sites, designated QAand QB (17Yankovskaya V. Sablin S.O. Ramsay R.R. Singer T.P. Ackrell B.A.C. Cecchini G.

Chem. 1993; 268: 815-822Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The QA site harbors a nonexchangeable quinone that is the primary electron acceptor from the iron-sulfur clusters in the catalytic dimer; it cycles between the oxidized and the semiquinone states. The QA site successively passes two electrons to the QB site, which harbors an exchangeable quinone. We have previously demonstrated the importance of residues 128–135 of the carboxyl terminus of the yeast Sdh4p for ubiquinone reduction (21Oyedotun K.S. Lemire B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31382-31388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The positive charge provided by Lys-132 is crucial for this function (22Oyedotun K.S. Lemire B.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1411: 170-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). In addition, we have recently documented the need for the membrane domain in the assembly of the SDH-associated cytochrome b562, although the role of this heme in catalysis remains unclear (23Oyedotun K.S. Lemire B.D. FEBS Lett. 1999; 442: 203-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 24Hederstedt L. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1998; 26: 408-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). To further investigate the structure and function of the yeast SDH membrane domain, we isolated and characterized seven SDH3 mutants. The mutant enzymes were characterized for their ability to support respiratory growth, as well as for enzyme stability, quinone reduction, heme b assembly, and inhibitor sensitivity. From our analyses, we conclude that a ubiquinone-binding site is likely associated with the matrix-facing loop connecting Sdh3p transmembrane segments II and III. Thus, the yeast SDH is suggested to contain two ubiquinone-binding sites that are topologically localized to different faces of the membrane. The S. cerevisiae strains MH125 (MATa, trp1, ura3–52, leu2–3, leu2–112, his3, his4, rme, ρ +) and sdh3W3 (MH125, sdh3::TRP1), and the E. coli strain DH5α have been described earlier (23Oyedotun K.S.

The yeast media used are SD (0.67% yeast nitrogen base, 2% glucose), SG (0.67% yeast nitrogen base, 3% glycerol), YPGal (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% galactose), YPDG (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 0.1% glucose, 2% glycerol), and semisynthetic galactose (0.3% yeast extract, 0.1% KH2PO4, 0.1% NH4Cl, 0.05% NaCl, 0.06% MgSO4·7H2O, 0.05% CaCl2, 0.003% FeCl3, 2% galactose). Cultures were grown on SD for 2–3 days to select for plasmid retention, used to inoculate YPGal medium supplemented with 0.01% glucose to a starting A600 = 0.05, and grown aerobically at 30 °C to stationary phase. Cells were harvested and lysed in a French pressure cell for the preparation of submitochondrial particles (21Oyedotun K.S. Lemire B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31382-31388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). For the preparation of mitochondria, cultures were grown in semisynthetic galactose to late logarithmic phase (A600 about 3), harvested, and lysed enzymatically (21Oyedotun K.S. Lemire B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31382-31388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). An Eco RI-Bgl II fragment containing the promoter and the entire coding region of the SDH3 gene was subcloned into the yeast-E. coli shuttle vector, YCplac111, to yield the plasmid pYCSDH3 and transformed into the E. coli strain DH5α. Cells were UV-irradiated at 254 nm with a dose rate of 1.4 J m−1 s−1 on LB plates in the dark to achieve 5–10% survival. The plates were incubated overnight at 37 °C in the dark. Colonies were scraped from a total of 100 plates, and plasmids were isolated. For chemical mutagenesis, suspensions of the DH5α pYCSDH3 were treated with 3% ethyl methanesulfonate to give 5–10% survival. Mutagenized plasmids were isolated and introduced into sdh3W3. Transformants were replica-plated onto SG and YPDG media. Colonies that exhibited impaired growth were further analyzed. Plasmids were recovered and retransformed into sdh3W3 to ensure that any growth defects were plasmid-mediated. Mutations were identified by sequencing the entire SDH3 gene. Unless otherwise stated, the succinate-dependent reduction of quinone was monitored spectrophotometrically at 22 °C as the malonate-sensitive 2,3-dimethoxy-5-methyl-6-decyl-1,4-benzoquinone (DB)-mediated reduction of 2,6-dichlorophenol indophenol (21Oyedotun K.S. Lemire B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31382-31388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The succinate-dependent, PMS-mediated reduction of 2,6-dichlorophenol indophenol is a measure of the membrane-associated catalytic dimer; this activity does not require catalytically competent Sdh3p and Sdh4p subunits, but they mediate the membrane association of the dimer (7Robinson K.M. von Kieckebusch-Gück A.

Quinone reduction was also directly monitored as the reduction of DB, using the wavelength pair 280 and 325 nm (26Bruel C. di Rago J.-P. Slonimski P.P. Lemesle-Meunier D. J. Biol.

Lemire B.D. FEBS Lett. 1999; 442: 203-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). We mutagenized an E. coli strain carrying the plasmid-borne yeast SDH3 gene with ultraviolet light and reintroduced the mutated plasmids into the SDH3 knockout strain, sdh3W3. Mutagenesis in E. coli, rather than in yeast, greatly reduces the production of respiration-deficient mitochondrial petites. About 5000 Leu+ sdh3W3 transformants were tested for respiratory growth on SG and YPDG media. Ten strains were impaired for growth, indicating a respiration deficiency. The strains were further analyzed by determining their growth yields on semisynthetic medium containing 0.5% galactose as carbon source. We isolated and sequenced the SDH3 genes from six strains that displayed growth yields ranging from 10 to 50%. We have found that growth yields of less than 10% are often associated with null alleles that abolish enzyme assembly. Five SDH3 mutants contained single base alterations, resulting in the substitutions of Phe-103 with Val (F103V), His-106 with Tyr (H106Y), His-113 with Glu (H113Q), Trp-116 with Arg (W116R), and Leu-122 with a stop codon (L122stop). This latter lesion truncates Sdh3p by removing the third transmembrane segment. A sixth mutant contains a single base deletion in the codon for Leu-52 that causes a frameshift mutation (L52FrShift) and truncates Sdh3p after the addition of two new amino acid residues, removing all three transmembrane segments. Ethyl methanesulfonate-treated plasmids were also isolated and tested for the presence of mutations by transformation into sdh3W3. Of the 1000 colonies screened, only one was incapable of respiratory growth. Sequencing revealed that the SDH3 gene contained two A to T transversions, replacing His-106 and Asp-117 with Leu and Val, respectively (H106L/D117V). Fig. 1 shows the growth of the seven mutants on semisynthetic medium containing 0.1–0.5% galactose. The growth yield of sdh3W3 is 10% of its parent, MH125; this represents only fermentative and no respiratory growth. The L52FrShift, H106L/D117V, and L122stop mutants achieved growth yields of 10% each. Because the L52FrShift is essentially an SDH3 knockout, it was not characterized further. The growth yield of the W116R mutant was reduced to 20%, consistent with its inability to grow on minimal glycerol medium. A growth yield of less than 30% is typical of petite strains. The F103V and H113Q mutants, with growth yields of 35 and 40%, respectively, were also severely impaired for growth on minimal glycerol. The H106Y mutant retained a significant capacity for respiratory growth, with a 50% growth yield. These results indicate that Trp-116, Phe-103, His-113, and His-106 or Asp-117 are important residues in Sdh3p. The loss of the third transmembrane segment in the L122stop mutant highlights the importance of this segment for SDH function. To determine whether the SDH3 mutations interfere with enzyme assembly, we measured the levels of covalent FAD in mitochondrial membranes from mutant and wild type strains (Table I). In S. cerevisiae, SDH is the major covalent flavoprotein and the covalent flavin levels of mitochondrial membranes reflect SDH assembly (27Robinson K.M. Lemire B.D. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 260: 34-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The covalent FAD levels of the F103V, H113Q, and W116R strains were not significantly different from the wild type. We conclude that SDH assembly is not significantly impaired in these mutants. The covalent FAD levels of the H106Y, H106L/D117V, and L122stop strains were reduced, indicating some impairment of enzyme assembly.Table IMeasurements of SDH assembly in mitochondrial membranesYeast strainCovalent FAD1-aAll values represent the mean of triplicate determinations ± S.E.

Open table in a new tab Also shown in Table I are the succinate-PMS reductase activities of the mutant and wild type enzymes. Membrane-associated succinate-dependent PMS reductase activity depends only on the membrane anchoring function of the membrane domain and not on its catalytic competence. To compare catalytic efficiencies, we determined turnover numbers using covalent FAD levels. The succinate-PMS reductase activities of the F103V, H106Y, H113Q, and W116R mutant enzymes are similar to that of the wild type enzyme in MH125 or sdh3W3 pYCSDH3. These data confirm that the primary defects in these mutants are not due to impaired assembly. The L122stop mutant has a turnover number only slightly less than that of MH125, indicating that its catalytic dimer retains wild type activity, although the lower level of covalent FAD in this mutant may indicate that the enzyme is only weakly attached to the membrane. In contrast, the turnover number of the H106L/D117V mutant enzyme is reduced, suggesting that an altered Sdh3p structure influences catalysis by the attached catalytic dimer. The steady state levels of the wild type and mutant Sdh3p subunits were compared by Western blot analysis (Fig. 2) (23Oyedotun K.S. Lemire B.D. FEBS Lett. 1999; 442: 203-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The W116R, H106L/D117V, H113Q, H106Y, and F103V Sdh3p levels (Fig. 2, lanes 4–8, respectively) were similar to those of the wild type strains (lanes 2 and 9). A truncated Sdh3p, expected to migrate at about 13.8 kDa, was not detectable in the L122stop mutant (lane 3). Its absence may be due to protein degradation, to enzyme instability, or to an altered behavior in the gel or blotting systems. However, the L122stop mutation did not eliminate enzyme assembly, as judged by the covalent FAD level and the succinate-PMS reductase activity of isolated membranes. As expected, Sdh3p was absent in sdh3W3 (Fig. 2, lane 1). Mitochondrial membranes of mutant and wild type strains were assayed for the DB-mediated reduction of 2,6-dichlorophenol indophenol (TableII). The succinate-DB reductase activities of the L122stop, F103V, H106L/D117V, and W116R mutants were sharply reduced (25, 24, 20, and 18% of the wild type turnover number, respectively). The H113Q mutant enzyme retained a low but significant activity (35% of wild type level), whereas the H106Y mutant was not greatly impaired (60% of wild type level). These values are consistent with the levels of respiratory growth seen on galactose medium (Fig. 1) and with their respective abilities to grow on minimal glycerol medium. As expected, sdh3W3 had no detectable activity.Table IIQuinone-mediated enzymatic activities of mitochondrial membranesMH125sdh3W3 pYCSDH3F103VH106YH106L/D117VH113QW116RL122stopsdh3W3Succinate-DB reductase2-aActivities are expressed as μmol of DB-mediated DCPIP reduced min−1 μmol of covalent FAD−1.31502-bActivities were measured in submitochondrial particles at saturating concentrations of all substrates.

Open table in a new tab We also measured the malonate-sensitive, succinate-cytochrome c reductase and the succinate-oxidase activities of the mutant enzymes (Table II). The first assay depends on complexes II and III of the respiratory chain, whereas the second depends on complexes II, III, and IV. Both assays rely on the reduction of endogenous ubiquinone. The succinate-cytochrome c reductase and the succinate oxidase activities paralleled the succinate-DB reductase activities. The membranes of the SDH3- deficient strain, sdh3W3, had undetectable levels of these enzymatic activities. The NADH oxidase and glycerol-1-phosphate-cytochrome c reductase activities were largely unaffected in all the mutants. Because these activities do not depend on succinate as the source of electrons, they demonstrate the integrity of the remainder of the respiratory chain. From these data, we can conclude that the effects that we have observed arise from defective SDH function and that the SDH3 mutations do not have pleiotropic effects on the other respiratory complexes present in the mitochondrial inner membrane. The kinetic parameters, Km and Vmax, were determined by varying the concentrations of DB at fixed concentrations of other substrates. The results are summarized in TableIII. The apparent KmDB values of the W116R and the H113Q mutant enzymes were increased by 3–4-fold, whereas those of the F103V and L122stop mutants were increased 2-fold. To compare the catalytic efficiencies of the enzymes, we also expressed the apparent Vmax as maximal turnover numbers (kcat) based on covalent FAD contents. We observed significant reductions in apparent kcatvalues that were not paralleled by the turnover values determined with the succinate-PMS reductase assay except for the H106L/D117V mutant (Table I). This indicates that the W116R, H113Q, F103V, and L122 stop mutations specifically affect the quinone reductase activities, probably through defects in protein-quinone interactions, as suggested by the apparent KmDB values. In contrast, we observed only a small increase in the apparent KmDB and a small decrease in the apparent kcat value of the H106Y mutant enzyme. The H106Y mutation likely does not affect protein-quinone interactions.Table IIIThe apparent Michaelis constants for succinate-DB reductase activitiesStrainKmVmax3-aValues are expressed as μmol of DB-mediated DCPIP reduced min−1 mg of protein−1.kcat3-bValues are expressed as μmol of DB-mediated DCPIP reduced min−1 μmol of covalent FAD−1.μmolMH1254.8 ± 0.1125.8 ± 2.83400 ± 75sdh3W3/pYCSDH35.5 ± 0.2123.2 ± 3.43250 ± 100F103V10.0 ± 0.332.9 ± 1.21000 ± 35H106Y7.0 ± 0.253.7 ± 1.72200 ± 70H106L/D117V7.3 ± 0.111.7 ± 0.3690 ± 15H113Q15.0 ± 0.539.3 ± 1.51300 ± 50W116R18.0 ± 1.019.3 ± 0.9612 ± 30L122stop11.0 ± 0.315.5 ± 0.4820 ± 20Kinetic parameters were determined by varying the concentration of DB at fixed concentrations of succinate and DCPIP.

Kmand Vmax values were calculated from a nonlinear regression fit to the Michaelis equation using initial estimates from the Lineweaver-Burk plots.

Changes in apparent Km may result from small structural perturbations that only alter the environment of the quinone-binding pocket or from larger perturbations that are propagated to the remainder of the enzyme. To explore these two possibilities, we determined the thermostabilities of the mutant and wild type enzymes. We incubated mitochondrial membranes at temperatures from 25 to 65 °C and monitored the succinate-dependent reduction of DB directly at the wavelength pair of 280 and 325 nm (Fig.3). All enzymes were stable at 25 °C. However, at higher temperatures, the F103V, H106Y, L122stop, and H106L/D117V mutant enzymes became thermolabile. This suggests that these mutations induce structu"
https://openalex.org/W1994506766,"The presence of a long interspersed nucleotide element, named L1Tc, which is actively transcribed in the parasite <i>Trypanosoma cruzi,</i> has been recently described. The open reading frame 1 of this element encodes the NL1Tc protein, which has apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease activity and is probably implicated in the first stage of the transposition of the element. In the present paper we show that NL1Tc effectively removes 3′-blocking groups (3′-phosphate and 3′-phosphoglycolate) from damaged DNA substrates. Thus, both 3′-phosphatase and 3′-phosphodiesterase activities are present in NL1Tc. We propose that these enzymatic activities would allow the 3′-blocking ends to function as targets for the insertion of L1Tc element, in addition to the apurinic/apyrimidinic sites previously described. The potential biological function of the NL1Tc protein has also been evidenced by its ability to repair the DNA damage induced by the methyl methanesulfonate alkylating or oxidative agents such as hydrogen peroxide and <i>t</i>-butyl hydroperoxide in <i>Escherichia coli</i> (<i>xth</i> and <i>xth</i>, <i>nfo</i>) mutants."

Deletion of any single residue in the Ala3–Ser6 region or deletion of two or more consecutive residues in the Ala3–Thr9 region caused strongly reduced expression. Substitution mutants A4K, A4D, and H5K also showed very low expression levels. Deletion of any single residue in the Ala3–Ser6 region caused only a small decrease in the specific Ca2+ transport rate/mg of SERCA1a protein. In contrast, other mutants showing low expression levels had greatly reduced specific Ca2+ transport rates. In vitro expression experiments indicated that translation, transcription, and integration into the microsomal membranes were not impaired in the mutants that showed very low expression levels in COS-1 cells. Pulse-chase experiments using [35S]methionine/cysteine labeling of transfected COS-1 cells demonstrated that degradation of the mutants showing low expression levels was substantially faster than that of the wild type. Lactacystin, a specific inhibitor of proteasome, inhibited the degradation accelerated by single-residue deletion of Ala3. These results suggest that the NH2-terminal region (Ala3 –Thr9) of SERCA1a is sensitive to the endoplasmic reticulum-mediated quality control and is thus critical for either correct folding of the SERCA1a protein or stabilization of the correctly folded SERCA1a protein or both.

SERCA1a is composed of 10 transmembrane α-helices (M1 to M10) and two main cytoplasmic domains, a small loop (Ala132 to Asp237 between M2 and M3) and a large loop (Asn330to Asn739 between M4 and M5) (1Brandl C.J. Green N.M. Korczak B. MacLennan D.H. Cell. 1986; 44: 597-607Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar). In addition, there is a small cytoplasmic NH2-terminal domain (Met1–Asn39). These cytoplasmic domains are connected by α-helical segments (called stalks) to the transmembrane α-helices. The large cytoplasmic loop contains the phosphorylation site and the ATP-binding site. Several residues in the small cytoplasmic loop were shown to play essential roles in the conformational transition of the phosphoenzyme intermediate (10Clarke D.M. Loo T.W. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14088-14092Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Andersen J.P. Vilsen B. Leberer E. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol.

We have recently indicated that Arg198 in this small loop contributes to the catalytic site (13Saino T. Daiho T. Kanazawa T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21142-21150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 14Daiho T. Suzuki H. Yamasaki K. Saino T. Kanazawa T. FEBS Lett. 1999; 444: 54-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The functional role of the NH2-terminal domain is less clear, although our recent chemical modification study (15Yamasaki K. Daiho T. Saino T. Kanazawa T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30627-30636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) has suggested that His5 in this domain is located very close to the catalytic site. It was previously shown (16Skerjanc I.S. Clarke D.M. Loo T.W. MacLennan D.H. FEBS Lett. 1993; 336: 168-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) that deletion of most of the residues (Glu2–His32) in the NH2-terminal domain results in greatly reduced expression in COS-1 cells and inactivation of the enzyme. This raises the possibility that the NH2-terminal domain has a region sensitive to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-mediated quality control, the machinery of which recognizes and rapidly degrades misfolded proteins (this misfolding can be induced by mutations) and denatured proteins to suppress their cellular expression or accumulation (17Ward C.L. Omura S. Kopito R.R. Cell. 1995; 83: 121-127Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1123) Google Scholar,18Kopito R.R. Cell. 1997; 88: 427-430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar). However, the ER-mediated quality control of the Ca2+-ATPase has not yet been reported. In this study, we have explored the possible roles of much smaller NH2-terminal regions (Glu2–Ala14, especially Ala3–Ser6) than the whole NH2-terminal domain (Met1–Asn39) in cellular expression of SERCA1a and its enzymatic function. We have made 45 mutants of SERCA1a in which residues in the Glu2–Ala14 region have been deleted or substituted, and the mutants have been expressed in COS-1 cells. The results show that deletions or specific substitutions of residues in the Ala3–Thr9 region lead to greatly reduced expression of the mutated SERCA1a proteins and rapid degradation of the expressed SERCA1a proteins. The results further show that residues in the Ala3–Ser6 region are not essential for the Ca2+ transport function. We suggest that the Ala3–Thr9 region is sensitive to the ER-mediated quality control and is thus critical either for correct folding of the SERCA1a protein or stabilization of the correctly folded SERCA1a protein or both. The methods employed have been described (14Daiho T. Suzuki H. Yamasaki K. Saino T. Kanazawa T. FEBS Lett. 1999; 444: 54-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). A summary of the methods is as follows. Overlap extension PCR (19Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6769) Google Scholar) was used to introduce mutations into the rabbit SERCA1a cDNA. The PCR products containing the desired mutation were subcloned into the pT7Blue vector (Novagen, Madison, WI). The mutated fragments were excised and religated back into their original position in the full-length SERCA1a cDNA that was previously ligated into the Eco RI site of the pMT2 expression vector (20Kaufman R.J. Davies M.V. Pathak V.K. Hershey J.W.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 946-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). The plasmid DNA was transfected into COS-1 cells (21Gluzman Y. Cell. 1981; 23: 175-182Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1449) Google Scholar) by the liposome-mediated DNA transfection procedure. Microsomal membranes were prepared from the cells as described by Maruyama and MacLennan (22Maruyama K. MacLennan D.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 3314-3318Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Microsomal proteins were separated by 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis according to Laemmli (23Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205492) Google Scholar). The expressed SERCA1a was detected by Western blotting, using VE121G9 monoclonal antibody to the rabbit SERCA1a (Affinity Bioreagents, Golden, CO). After incubation with secondary antibody (sheep anti-mouse IgG horseradish peroxidase-conjugated, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), the bound proteins were probed using an enhanced chemiluminescence-linked detection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Immunoreactivity was quantitated by densitometry. In the assay, the standard enzyme used was the deoxycholate-purified rabbit SERCA1a that was prepared by the method of Meissner and Fleischer (24Meissner G. Fleischer S. Methods Enzymol. 1974; 32: 475-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) with slight modifications as described previously (25Kubota T. Daiho T. Kanazawa T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1163: 131-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In addition to Western blotting, quantitation of SERCA1a expression was also obtained by a sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay as described below. Ca2+transport activity was assayed at 27 °C in a mixture containing 5–10 μ g/ml microsomal protein, 20 mmMOPS-Tris (pH 7.0), 0.1 m KCl, 7 mmMgCl2, 5 mm ATP, 5 mm potassium oxalate, and 0.1 mm45CaCl2. At different time periods, 0.5-ml samples were filtered through a 0.45-μ m mixed cellulose ester membrane filter (ADVANTEC Toyo Kaisha, Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) and washed three times with 5 ml of a solution containing 20 mm MOPS-Tris (pH 7.0), 0.1m KCl, 7 mm MgCl2, and 2 mm EGTA. Radioactivity on the filters was measured by liquid scintillation counting. The Ca2+ transport curve in the presence of 0.5 μ m thapsigargin with the microsomal membranes expressing the wild-type or mutant SERCA1a was not significantly different from that with control microsomal membranes, which were prepared from COS-1 cells transfected with the pMT2 vector containing no SERCA1a cDNA. Therefore, the Ca2+transport curve of the expressed SERCA1a was obtained by subtracting the amount of Ca2+ transported in the presence of 0.5 μ m thapsigargin from that in its absence. The Ca2+ transport activity of the expressed SERCA1a was calculated from the initial linear part of the Ca2+transport curve thus obtained. The specific transport rates/mg of SERCA1a protein were calculated from the thapsigargin-sensitive Ca2+ transport activity and the amount of the expressed SERCA1a, which was quantified by a sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay as described by Leberer and Pette (26Leberer E. Pette D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1986; 156: 489-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). In this assay, purified sheep anti-rabbit SERCA1a IgG was used to coat the plates, and monoclonal antibody VE121G9 was used for the specific reaction with the bound SERCA1a. After incubation with secondary antibody (sheep anti-mouse IgG horseradish peroxidase-conjugated), staining was performed with tetramethylbenzidine base (TMB-ELISA, Life Technologies, Inc.). The staining reaction was stopped by adding 0.2 nH2SO4. The absorbance at 450 nm was measured. PCR mutagenesis was used to insert a Hin dIII site immediately before the initiator methionine and a Sac I site immediately after the stop codon of the SERCA1a using the full-length SERCA1a cDNA as template. The PCR product was subcloned into the pT7Blue vector, and then a coding region for the SERCA1a was ligated as a 5′ Hin dIII to 3′ Sac I fragment into pSP64 poly(A) vector (Promega, Madison, WI). PCR mutagenesis was employed to make mutants using this plasmid as template and mutagenic 5′-flanking primers. The PCR product carrying a Hin dIII site 5′ to the SERCA1a cDNA was subcloned into the pT7Blue vector, and then the approximately 640-base Hin dIII-Kpn I fragments were excised from the vector. The restriction fragments carrying the mutations were religated back into the original position in the SERCA1a cDNA that was ligated into the pSP64 poly(A) vector. The pSP64 poly(A) vector harboring the wild-type or mutant SERCA1a cDNA was added into a reaction mixture containing the rabbit reticulocyte lysate in vitro transcription and translation mix and canine pancreatic microsomal membranes (both from Promega) in the presence of [35S]methionine (RedivueTM, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and was incubated according to the manufacturer's instructions. Membrane fractions were then isolated from the reaction mixture by centrifugation. The samples were either untreated or treated with 1 m KCl or 100 mmNa2CO3 (pH 11.5) for 10 min on ice and recovered by centrifugation. The pellets were separated by 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis according to Laemmli (23Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205492) Google Scholar) and subjected to Western blotting or to digital autoradiography of the dried gel using Bio-Imaging Analyzer BAS2000 (Fuji Photo Film Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). COS-1 cells were transfected with the pMT2 vector containing the wild-type or mutated SERCA1a cDNA and cultured for 22 h, as described previously (14Daiho T. Suzuki H. Yamasaki K. Saino T. Kanazawa T. FEBS Lett. 1999; 444: 54-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The cells were starved for 2 h at 37 °C in methionine/cysteine-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and pulse-labeled with [35S]methionine/cysteine (80 μ Ci/ml) (RedivueTM PRO-MIXTM, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in the medium for 2 h at 37 °C. The cells were then chased in minimum essential medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) at 37 °C. At different times after the start of the chase, the cells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline and harvested. The cells were then lysed for 1 h at 4 °C in the lysis buffer (1% (v/v) IGEPAL CA-630 (Sigma), 15 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.15 m NaCl, and 1 mm EDTA) containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Sigma) and 100 units/ml aprotinin (Sigma). After insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 18,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, incorporation of 35S into the total protein pool was determined by spotting an aliquot of lysate onto the mixed cellulose ester membrane filter and boiling the filter for 10 min in 5% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid containing 5 mm methionine and 5 mm cysteine. The radioactivity on the spot was quantitated by digital autoradiography of the dried filter using Bio-Imaging Analyzer BAS2000. Lysate volumes for immunoprecipitation were normalized by trichloroacetic acid-precipitable radioactivity. Immunoprecipitation of the SERCA1a was performed by incubating the lysates overnight at 4 °C with purified sheep anti-rabbit SERCA1a IgG and protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in the lysis buffer. The beads were washed five times with the lysis buffer, resuspended in Laemmli sample buffer (23Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205492) Google Scholar), and centrifuged. The supernatants were subjected to 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis according to Laemmli (23Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205492) Google Scholar). The radioactivity associated with the separated SERCA1a was quantitated by the digital autoradiography of the dried gels as above. When effects of lactacystin were investigated, the pulse labeling and chase were performed in the absence and presence of 10 μ m lactacystin; other conditions were as described above. Protein concentrations were determined by the method of Lowry et al. (27Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with bovine serum albumin as a standard. Dideoxy sequencing (28Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52239) Google Scholar) was carried out to ensure fidelity of the PCR amplification step and to confirm the presence of the correct mutations. Polyclonal anti-rabbit SERCA1a antibody was prepared by injecting a sheep with the deoxycholate-purified rabbit SERCA1a (25Kubota T. Daiho T. Kanazawa T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1163: 131-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) as described by Leberer and Pette (26Leberer E. Pette D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1986; 156: 489-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Anti-rabbit SERCA1a IgG was purified through DEAE Affi-Gel Blue (Bio-Rad) column chromatography of an ammonium sulfate-precipitated fraction (0–33%) of anti-rabbit SERCA1a antiserum, according to standard procedures. Amino acid residues in the NH2-terminal Glu2–Ala14 region of SERCA1a were deleted or substituted, and the mutants were expressed in COS-1 cells. A typical example of Western blots of the deletion mutants expressed in microsomal membranes is shown in Fig. 1. Visual inspection reveals that expression was only slightly reduced by deletion of 3 residues from Glu2 to Ala4 but greatly reduced by deletions of 4–13 consecutive residues from Glu2 to Ala14. Expression was also greatly reduced by deletions of 2–4 consecutive residues from Ser6to Thr9. In addition to the above deletion mutants, 33 mutants were made in which residues in the Glu2–Thr9 region were deleted or substituted. The expression levels of the mutants were determined by quantitative densitometry of the proteins visualized with enhanced chemiluminescence and normalized to that of the wild type (Fig. 2). Expression was only partially reduced in the deletion mutants Δ2, Δ2–3, and Δ2–4 but greatly reduced in the mutants with deletions of 4–13 consecutive residues from Glu2 to Ala14, as expected from inspection of Fig. 1. Expression of the mutants with deletions of 2–4 consecutive residues in the Ala3–Thr9 region was also greatly reduced. Strikingly, expression of the mutants with deletions of any single residue in the Ala3–Ser6 region was markedly reduced. Expression was greatly reduced in the substitution mutants A4K, A4D, and H5K but not significantly or only partially reduced in other substitution mutants tested. These results indicate that deletions of 1 or more residues in the Ala3–Thr9 region or specific substitutions of Ala4 with lysine and aspartic acid or His5 with lysine result in strongly reduced expression in COS-1 cells. The specific Ca2+ transport rates/mg of SERCA1a protein were determined with the mutants in which residues in the NH2-terminal Glu2–Ser8region were deleted or substituted, and the rates were normalized to that of the wild-type SERCA1a (Fig. 3). Deletion of any single residue in the Ala3–Ser6 region caused only a small decrease in the specific Ca2+ transport rate. This indicates that these single-residue deletions have only small effects on the enzyme structure essential for Ca2+ transport function. The specific Ca2+ transport rates in the substitution mutants A3D, A4L, H5D, and S6L were not significantly different from that of the wild type. These results show that the amino acid residues in the Ala3–Ser6 region are not essential for Ca2+ transport function. Previously, Skerjanc et al. (16Skerjanc I.S. Clarke D.M. Loo T.W. MacLennan D.H. FEBS Lett. 1993; 336: 168-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) reported that there is no indication from site-directed mutagenesis that specific residues in the Glu2–His32 region are crucial for enzymatic activity. This is consistent with our above conclusion. On the other hand, when 2–4 consecutive residues in the Glu2–Ser8 region were deleted (Δ2–5, Δ3–4, Δ4–5, Δ5–6, and Δ6–8), the specific Ca2+transport rates were greatly reduced. The transport rates were also greatly reduced in the substitution mutants A4K, A4D, and H5K. These results indicate that deletions of 2 or more residues in the Glu2–Ser8 region, or specific substitutions of Ala4 with lysine and aspartic acid or His5 with lysine, induce structural changes that lead to inactivation of the enzyme. This is in harmony with our previous results from chemical modification of His5 (15Yamasaki K. Daiho T. Saino T. Kanazawa T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30627-30636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) suggesting that His5is located very close to the catalytic site. In vitro expression experiments were performed with a cell-free transcription/translation system containing pancreatic microsomal membranes in the presence of [35S]methionine (Fig. 4). The wild-type SERCA1a or five mutants (Δ2–5, Δ4–5, Δ5–6, Δ6–8, and A4K) showing very low expression levels in COS-1 cells (see Fig. 2) were expressed in this system. The membrane fractions isolated were either untreated or treated with salt or base under conditions in which all but integral proteins are usually removed (29Fujiki Y. Fowler S. Shio H. Hubbard A.L. Lazarow P.B. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 93: 103-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar), and the samples were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The digital autoradiogram of the gel showed a single major band for each sample (Fig. 4, left panel) at the position of the rabbit SERCA1a (Fig. 4, arrows). These major bands were identified as the expressed SERCA1a protein by Western blotting with the monoclonal anti-rabbit SERCA1a antibody (Fig. 4, right panel). The digital autoradiogram and Western blot showed that the expression levels of the mutants were similar to or even higher than those of the wild type and that all the mutants tested and the wild type were integrated into the membrane in a fashion resistant to extraction with salt or base. These results indicate that transcription, translation, and integration into the microsomal membranes are not impaired in these mutants. This raised the possibility that these mutants are degraded rapidly in COS-1 cells, although the interference of the mutations with the membrane assembly of the expressed SERCA1a in COS-1 cells is also possible because such interference was previously demonstrated by Zhang et al. (30Zhang Z. Sumbilla C. Lewis D. Summers S. Klein M.G. Inesi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16283-16290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with the mutations in the SERCA1a segment from the phosphorylation site (Asp351) to the transmembrane helix M4. Thus, we examined the degradation of the mutants in COS-1 cells by pulse-chase experiments. COS-1 cells expressing the wild-type or mutant SERCA1a were pulse-labeled with [35S]methionine/cysteine, chased, and then lysed. The SERCA1a in the lysate was immunoprecipitated. Lysate volumes for immunoprecipitation were normalized by trichloroacetic acid-precipitable radioactivity. The radioactivity of the SERCA1a thus obtained was quantitated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and digital autoradiography (Fig. 5). Relative amounts of the radiolabeled wild-type SERCA1a increased during the chase period. This shows that degradation of the wild-type SERCA1a was slower than the decrease in the total trichloroacetic acid-precipitable radioactivity. Degradation was not affected by the H5D substitution, which had no effect on the expression level in COS-1 cells (see Fig. 2) and on the specific Ca2+ transport rate (see Fig. 3). In contrast, degradation was accelerated moderately in the single-residue deletion mutants Δ3, Δ4, Δ5, and Δ6, in which expression in COS-1 cells was reduced substantially (see Fig. 2) but the specific Ca2+ transport rate was reduced only partially (see Fig.3). Degradation was more strongly accelerated in the 2-residue deletion mutants Δ3–4, Δ4–5, and Δ5–6 and the substitution mutants in which both the expression levels in COS-1 cells (see Fig. 2) and the specific Ca2+ transport rates (see Fig. 3) were reduced greatly. Degradation was most strongly accelerated in the 4-residue deletion mutant Δ2–5, in which expression in COS-1 cells was at the lowest level (see Fig. 2) and the specific Ca2+ transport rate was abolished almost completely (see Fig. 3). These results indicate that the reduced expression of these mutants in COS-1 cells was due to accelerated intracellular degradation of the mutants. The results further suggest that substantial acceleration of degradation and strong suppression of cellular expression of the mutants probably can be induced even by small structural changes that have only small effects on the specific Ca2+ transport rate as shown with the single-residue deletion mutants. It is well documented that the single-residue deletion of phenylalanine (ΔF508) from a cytoplasmic portion of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), which is a 1480-residue protein containing 12 putative transmembrane segments, induces its rapid ER quality control-mediated degradation and leads to greatly reduced plasma membrane expression but does not severely impair the function of CFTR (31Kopito R.R. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: S167-S173Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). This situation closely resembles our present results with the single-residue deletion mutants. This prompted us to explore the possibility that structural changes induced by deletions or substitutions in the Glu2–Ser6 region of SERCA1a are recognized by the ER quality control machinery. The effect of lactacystin, a specific proteasome inhibitor, on degradation of the mutants was examined (Fig.6). The presence of 10 μ m lactacystin in the medium throughout the pulse and chase periods resulted in a substantially reduced rate of degradation of the single-residue deletion mutant Δ3. This indicates that proteasome is involved in the Δ3 deletion-induced acceleration of degradation and suggests that the mutant Δ3 is degraded by the ER quality control machinery as the mutant ΔF508 of CFTR. However, lactacystin did not affect the degradation of the mutants Δ2–5, Δ4–5, Δ5–6, and H5K, whose degradation was much more rapid than that of the single-residue deletion mutants (see Fig. 5). This finding suggests that a lactacystin-insensitive protease(s), rather than proteasome, is involved in the very rapid degradation of these mutants. Unexpectedly, degradation of the wild type was accelerated by addition of lactacystin. The reason for this acceleration remains obscure. No degradation intermediates were detected by immunoprecipitation analysis using polyclonal anti-rabbit SERCA1a antibody in the pulse-chase experiments (data not shown), in agreement with the previously reported findings that no degradation intermediates were detected in the ER quality control of the enzyme 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase (32McGee T.P. Cheng H.H. Kumagai H. Omura S. Simoni R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25630-25638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) and the mutated ATP-binding cassette transporter Pdr5 (33Plemper R.K. Egner R. Kuchler K. Wolf D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32848-32856Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). This suggests that the rate-limiting step in the degradation of the mutants occurs before proteolysis by proteasome or other proteases. It is likely that this rate-limiting step (possibly unfolding of the protein) is more strongly accelerated by deletions of 2 or more residues in the Glu2–Ser6 region or by the A4D or H5K substitution than by single-residue deletions in the Ala3–Ser6 region. The present results indicate that the NH2-terminal region (Ala3–Thr9) of SERCA1a is very sensitive to the ER quality control, the machinery of which recognizes misfolded or denatured proteins and rapidly degrades these abnormal proteins (17Ward C.L. Omura S. Kopito R.R. Cell. 1995; 83: 121-127Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1123) Google Scholar,18Kopito R.R. Cell. 1997; 88: 427-430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is very likely that this region is critical for either correct folding of the SERCA1a protein or stabilization of the correctly folded SERCA1a protein or both. Single mutations in other sequence segments in the SERCA1a were previously reported to have effects similar to those reported in this study. Zhang et al. (30Zhang Z. Sumbilla C. Lewis D. Summers S. Klein M.G. Inesi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16283-16290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) showed that mutation of Ala331 to Arg yields very low protein levels in COS-1 cells, whereas transcription is normal. Yu et al. (34Yu M. Lin J. Khadeer M. Yeh Y. Inesi G. Hussain A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 362: 225-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) reported that mutation of Phe256 to Glu reduces expression greatly but not enzyme activity. The NH2-terminal region (Ala3–Thr9) of SERCA1a shares virtually no homology with the NH2-terminal domains of plasma membrane Ca2+-ATPase (35Verma A.K. Filoteo A.G. Stanford D.R. Wieben E.D.

It was previously shown that deletion of the NH2-terminal 18–75 residues from the plasma membrane Ca2+-ATPase (40Grimaldi M.E. Adamo H.P. Rega A.F. Penniston J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26995-26997Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) or deletion of the NH2-terminal 1–32 residues from the Na+,K+-ATPase (41Boxenbaum N. Daly S.E.

It is possible that the role of the NH2-terminal region described in this paper is specific to the family of sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPases, because the NH2-terminal domains of the Ca2+-ATPases in this family have considerably high homology to each other (42Burk S.E.

It has two roles. First, it regulates the availability of free iron in the body fluids, preventing the production of potentially toxic free radicals, and providing bacteriostatic functions. Second, it mediates the transport and uptake of iron into cells. The process of receptor-mediated endocytosis is responsible for the uptake of transferrin by cells. The general features of transferrin uptake by this process are now well understood (1Klausner R.D. Ashwell G. Harford J.B. Bridges K.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

First, iron-saturated transferrin binds to the transferrin receptor at the cell surface and is then internalized by clatherin coated vesicles into early endosomes. Here, the pH is mildly acidic and causes the release of iron from the transferrin. The transferrin-receptor complex then recycles back to the plasma membrane, where the neutral pH results in the dissociation of the iron-deficient transferrin from the receptor and release into the plasma. This transferrin is then free to bind more iron, and the receptor is free to bind more iron-loaded transferrin. Although all living cells require iron, only those cells that have a high requirement for iron express large numbers of transferrin receptors (6Iacopetta B.J. Morgan E.H. Yeoh G.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 687: 204-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Most normal resting human cells require little iron for healthy cell function and do not manifest detectable transferrin receptors on their plasma membranes (7Gatter K.C. Brown G. Trowbridge I.S. Woolston R.E. Mason D.Y. J Clin. Pathol. 1983; 36: 539-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). In contrast, erythrocyte precursors, together with all actively proliferating tissues, do show detectable levels of transferrin receptor expression (for examples, see Ref. 8Huebers H.A. Finch C.A. Physiol. Rev. 1987; 67: 520-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar). This reflects the increased requirement of iron for metabolism during growth and development. Tumor cells also express high levels of transferrin receptors (see Refs. 9Faulk W.P. Hsi B.L. Stevens P.J. Lancet. 1980; 2: 390-392Abstract PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 10Yeh C.J. Taylor C.G.

This finding led to the proposal that the transferrin uptake pathway could be used for the targeted delivery of mimetic chemotherapeutic drugs (9Faulk W.P. Hsi B.L. Stevens P.J. Lancet. 1980; 2: 390-392Abstract PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Trowbridge and Domingo (13Trowbridge I.S. Domingo D.L. Nature. 1981; 294: 171-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar) later reported that this was indeed possible by demonstrating that tumor cells could be killed using monoclonal anti-transferrin receptor antibody conjugated with fragments of the ricin and diphtheria toxin. These conjugates were effective at killing human tumor cells in vitro at concentrations of up to 10,000 lower than uncoupled antibody plus toxin. Raso and Basala (14Raso V. Basala M. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 1143-1149Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) later showed that similar increases in cyctotoxicity could be achieved when transferrin, rather than an anti-transferrin receptor, is used (14Raso V. Basala M. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 1143-1149Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since these studies, numerous other reports have demonstrated the use of transferrin to enhance the potency of a range of other toxic proteins and anti-neoplastic drugs, including Adriamycin (15Yeh C.J.

Chem. 1991; 266: 21202-21207Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In recent years, several studies have demonstrated that the use of the transferrin uptake pathway is highly effective in animal models and humans. Particularly, Laske et al. (26Laske D.W. Ilercil O. Akbasak A. Youle R.J. Oldfield E.H. J. Neurosurg. 1994; 80: 520-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) showed that HST/diphtheria toxin conjugates are effective at eradicating human glioma tumors in mice. Treatment produced on average 95% regression in tumor volume after 30 days. In contrast, tumor volumes increased by about 300% in animals treated with free toxin and by 1000% in the controls. A clinical trial has demonstrated that this conjugate is also effective in humans (27Laske D.W. Youle R.J. Oldfield E.H. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 1362-1368Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). Patients with recurrent malignant brain tumors received the conjugate intracerebrally using high flow interstitial microinfusion. Two of the 15 treated patients showed complete remission, and 9 showed a 50% reduction in tumor volume, as determined by nuclear magnetic resonance imaging. In none of the patients were there any signs of systemic toxicity. Whether transferrin or anti-transferrin receptor antibodies are used to target drugs via the transferrin uptake pathway, it is clear that this is an effective approach for drug delivery. A novel way to use the transferrin uptake pathway for the cellular delivery of therapeutic agents would be to incorporate the drug into the structure of transferrin. One way to do this would be to modify the iron-binding site of transferrin such that instead of binding iron it is able to bind a drug molecule. A major problem with this is that because not all the structural determinants of iron and receptor binding are known, it would be very difficult to design a functional molecule. Alternatively, the drug could be incorporated into the structure of transferrin itself, using recombinant protein engineering techniques. This would be appropriate for peptide drugs. Peptide drugs often have short biological half-lives, and those that are water-soluble usually do not penetrate the cell membrane readily (for a review, see Ref. 28Darke P.L. Huff J.R. Adv. Pharmacol. 1994; : 399-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). A recombinant transferrin analogue that contains a therapeutically active peptide sequence would overcome these problems. Surface exposed loops of globular proteins can frequently tolerate insertions of additional amino acids without altering the function of the protein (29Finkelstein A.V. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1997; 7: 60-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Therefore, it should be possible to introduce peptide sequences into the surface of transferrin without destroying function. As such, the peptides would “hide” in the surface of the transferrin analogue, be actively taken up into the cell, and then recognized (i.e. be functional) at the site of inhibitory activity. In this scenario, the function of the transferrin molecule would be analogous to that of a “Trojan horse” for the delivery of the peptide sequence into the cell. That there are no described toxic side effects of transferrin, that its use has already been approved from a number of clinical studies, its long circulatory half-life, and the fact that it has already been widely used for targeted delivery of drugs into cells that express high levels of transferrin receptors are all strengths that support its use for this purpose. The design and evaluation of recombinant transferrin analogues as a novel drug delivery system is the subject of this report. To demonstrate proof of this principle, we have chosen to generate transferrin analogues targeted to the protease of HIV-1, the etiological agent of AIDS. A peptide sequence (VSQNYPIVL) that is cleavable by HIV-1 protease was selected as the foreign competitive “therapeutic” peptide. A functional transferrin analogue would maintain native transferrin function, yet be cleaved by HIV-1 protease. The HST analogue would therefore function as a competitive substrate for HIV-1 protease. The idea of using a competing substrate to inhibit HIV-1 protease is not new. It is known that in vitro, the enzyme can be inhibited by competing synthetic peptides (28Darke P.L. Huff J.R. Adv. Pharmacol. 1994; : 399-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). However, these peptides are poorly soluble and are rapidly cleared from the general circulation. Recently, intracellular expression of a fusion protein containing the HIV-1 Vpr and the p17/p24 HIV-1 protease cleavage site from Gag was shown to inhibit the production of infectious HIV-1 particles (30Serio D. Rizvi T.A. Cartas M. Kalyanaraman V.S. Weber I.T. Koprowski H. Srinivasan A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3346-3351Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Additionally, because there are no known mammalian proteases that can cleave the SQNY cleavage motif in the p17/p24 cleavage site, such an inhibitor will be specific for HIV-1 protease. Thus, in this study, the p17/p24 cleavage site was chosen as the peptide sequence to be inserted into the HST analogues. Importantly, HIV-1 replication induces cell activation, concomitantly up-regulating the levels of HST receptor expression (31Levy J.A. Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 57: 183-289Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, HIV-1 infected cells would be ideal targets for HST-directed therapy, much in the same way as tumors are. It is not completely clear how HIV-1 causes cell activation, but it is known that transcription factors involved with activation, such as NFκB and SP1, are up-regulated (31Levy J.A. Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 57: 183-289Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and HIV-1 Rev protein can up-regulate the expression of HST receptors (32Zolotukhin A.S. Harford J.B. Felber B.K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4725-4732Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). HST is itself an ideal transport molecule for an anti-HIV-1 drug because it is nontoxic, has a long circulatory half-life, and can penetrate all tissue compartments of the body that are known to harbor HIV-1 infected cells, including the brain. Thus, the idea of using an HST/HIV-1 protease cleavage site analogue to prevent HIV-1 infection and replication is a viable new therapeutic strategy. Restriction and modification enzymes were purchased from New England Biolabs (Schwalbach, Taunus, Germany). Native HST was obtained from Sigma and Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Oligonucleotides and peptides were provided by Genosys (Cambridge, United Kingdom), which also synthesized the HST/HIV-1 protease cleavage site peptide conjugate. The BacPAK baculovirus expression system was purchased from CLONTECH (Palo Alto, CA). Antisera were produced in rabbits using standard techniques. HIV-1 protease was a gift from A. Billich (Novartis Research Institute, Vienna, Austria). The three-dimensional structure of rabbit serum transferrin (RST), solved by x-ray crystallography, was used in the modeling study to investigate the effects of the insertion of the HIV-1 p17/p24 protease cleavage site sequence, VSQNYPIVL, on the tertiary structure of the native protein. The results of this investigation were assumed to be valid for HST (for which no tertiary structure is available), given the high degree of sequence identity of 81% between HST and RST. The first step in this study was to select suitable insertion sites for the HIV-1 protease cleavage site sequence. For this step, careful consideration of the structural effects of the proposed mutations on the native protein structure and consequent alteration of function and/or activity must be made. Hence, surface exposed loop regions, distant from residues known to be essential for activity, present possible options for introducing mutagenic sequences that would have minimal effect on overall structure and function of the protein. This was performed by inserting the nine amino acid residues of the HIV-1 protease cleavage site sequence into the molecular model of the N-lobe of the RST sequence. The atomic coordinates of the N-lobe were taken from the crystallographically solved structure obtained from the Brookhaven Protein Data Base (Brookhaven National Laboratory, Upton, NY). The molecular modeling was carried out on a Silicon Graphics Indigo II Workstation, using the Discover module from the Biosym software Insight II. An energy minimization was subsequently performed on the resultant mutant protein structure. The energy minimized structure shows that all residues more than 25 Å from the inserted residues were restrained. Energy minimizations using the steepest descent (2000 steps, derivative = 0.1), followed by dynamic runs (T = 1000 K, time step = 1 fs, steps = 1000), were used to give minimal energy model structures of the mutant proteins. The native HST gene used in this study was a cDNA subcloned into the baculovirus transfer vector pBacPAK8 as described by Ali and co-workers (33Ali S.A. Joao H.C. Csonga R. Hammerschmid F. Steinkasserer A. Biochem. J. 1996; 319: 191Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). This plasmid, termed p8T, contains the powerful polyhedrin promoter to drive expression of the HST gene, a polyadenylation site and sequences to allow homologous recombination with a baculoviral vector. Cassette mutagenesis was used to construct the HST mutant M289, which contains the inserted protease cleavage site at codon 289 of the HST sequence. Essentially, a 251-base pair region of p8T was amplified by PCR using the primers 5′-tta att gaa ttc caa cta ttc agc tct cct gtt tct cag aac tac cct atc gtc ctc cat ggg aag gac ctg ctg ttt aag-3′ and 5′-ccc tac act gtt aac act cca ctc-3′. These primers contain the Eco RI and Hpa II restriction sites (italics) and the nucleotides coding for the inserted protease cleavage site (underlined). This PCR fragment was then cloned into p8T via the Eco RI and Hpa II restriction sites and then checked using a commercially available sequencing kit (Sequenase, version 2, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The resulting construct, p8TM289, is identical to the wild type construct p8T.1 except that at codon 289 the nucleotides coding for the HIV-1 protease cleavage site are inserted. In a similar fashion, cassette mutagenesis was used to insert the nucleotide sequence coding for the HIV-1 protease cleavage site at codon 279, creating p8TM279. The primers used for the PCR were 5′-tta att gaa ttc ttt tga cag gac gat agg gta gtt ctg aga aac ttt gtc ttt gcc aaa atg ttc ctg g-3′ and 5′-tgc agg c ct cga g tt cga atc-3′ and contain the Xho I and Eco RI restriction sites (italics) for cloning. To construct mutants M33, M75, and M257, which contain the inserted HIV-1 protease cleavage site at codons 33, 75 and 257, respectively, the novel procedure PCR-ligation-PCR mutagenesis was used as described by Ali et al. (34Ali S.A. Steinkasserer A. BioTechniques. 1995; 18: 746-750PubMed Google Scholar, 35Ali S.A. Steinkasserer A. Schaefer B. Gene Cloning and Analysis: Current Innovations. Horizon Scientific Press Ltd., Wymondham, United Kingdom1997: 133-145Google Scholar, 36Ali S.A. Sarto I. Steinkasserer A. BioTechniques. 1997; 22: 1060-1062Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Essentially, this procedure involves two steps. In the primary PCR amplification, the two regions adjacent to the insertion site are amplified. The internal primers used in these reactions contain the sequence to be introduced. After a short phosphorylation step (15 min), the PCR products are ligated and amplified in a secondary PCR using the external primers used for the primary PCR. This results in the production of a fusion gene, which contains the inserted nucleotide sequence. The fusion product was then cloned into the wild type transfer plasmid p8T via the Xho I and Eco RI restriction sites. The respective primers used to produce the upstream and downstream PCR fragments were MUT1/MUT2 and MUT3/MUT10 for M33, MUT1/MUT4 and MUT5/MUT10 for M75, MUT1/MUT6 and MUT7/MUT10 for M257. The sequences of these primers are as follows: MUT1, 5′-tgc agg cct cga gtt cga atc-3′; MUT2, 5′-ttt aaa gcg gcc gct tat tgt gac gag ggg tcg ctg cc-3′; MUT3, 5′-tgc ttg ccc ctg gag gtt ctg cac-3′; MUT4, 5′-gta cat cag gcc ata tca cct aga ac-3′; MUT5, 5′-cct atc gtc ctg aat aac ctg aag cct gtg gtg gc-3′; MUT6, 5′-gta gtt ctg aga aac cat act tcg ggc cac gac gg-3′; MUT7, 5′-cct atc gtc ctg ggc ggc aag gag gac ttg atc-3′; MUT10, 5′-gga gag ctg aat agt tgg aat tc-3′. Sequences of all regions that were PCR-amplified were checked using a commercial DNA sequencing kit (Sequenase, version 2.0, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Recombinant virus was generated using the BacPAK baculovirus expression system (CLONTECH), as described by Ali et al. (33Ali S.A. Joao H.C. Csonga R. Hammerschmid F. Steinkasserer A. Biochem. J. 1996; 319: 191Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) using the High Five insect cell line (BTI TN 5BI-4; Invitrogen Corp., San Diego, CA). Essentially, the transfer plasmid was co-transfected into the host cells using lipofection. The viral DNA is a linearized replication-deficient recombinant baculovirus DNA (BacPAK6) derived from Autographia californica nuclear polyhedrosis virus. Recombinant virus was isolated, expanded in suspension cultures, and titrated using standard methods (37O'Reilly D.R. Miller L.K. Luckow V.A. Baculovirus Expression Vectors: A Laboratory Manual. Oxford University Press, Oxford, United Kingdom1994Google Scholar). High Five cell monolayer cultures were grown at 27 °C in SF900II serum-free medium (Life Technologies GmbH, Berlin, Germany), supplemented with 1 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml streptomycin, and 100 μg/ml penicillin. Suspension cultures included an additional supplement of 10 units/ml heparin (sodium salt; grade 1-A from porcine intestinal mucosa; Sigma-Aldrich Handels GmbH, Vienna, Austria). These cultures were shaken at 80 rpm at a density of 0.5–2.0 × 106 cells/ml. High Five cells grown in suspension culture were pelleted by centrifugation at 400 ×g for 15 min in a preparative centrifuge and then resuspended in viral supernatant at a density of 4 × 106 cells/ml and a multiplicity of infection of 1. The viral supernatant was prepared by dilution of the viral stock in medium and then adding fresh heparin, glutamine, and antibiotics to give the concentrations indicated above. The infection was allowed to proceed for 1 h at 27 °C in an Erlenmyer flask with shaking at 80 rpm. The cells were then pelleted as above, resuspended in fresh medium at 1 × 106 cells/ml, and shaken for a further 48 h at 27 °C and 80 rpm. Cells were then removed from the HST-containing supernatants by centrifugation as described (33Ali S.A. Joao H.C. Csonga R. Hammerschmid F. Steinkasserer A. Biochem. J. 1996; 319: 191Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Recombinant HST was purified from the expression culture supernatants using hydrophobic interaction chromatography with a phenyl-Sepharose® column (High Load™, 26/10, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), as described by Ali et al. (33Ali S.A. Joao H.C. Csonga R. Hammerschmid F. Steinkasserer A. Biochem. J. 1996; 319: 191Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Briefly, an equal volume of 2.4 mammonium sulfate and 0.8 m tri-sodium citrate (pH 6) was mixed with the supernatant, and the precipitate was removed by centrifugation. The supernatant was then loaded onto the column and washed with 1.2 m ammonium sulfate, 0.4 mcitrate (Buffer A), and the protein was eluted in a gradient of 0–50% water in Buffer A. The HST-containing fractions (identified using SDS-PAGE analysis) were collected and dialyzed against 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8 (Buffer B), for 2 h. As a final “polishing” step, the protein was chromatographed on a Q-Sepharose® Fast Flow ion exchange column. Briefly, after washing pure HST eluted in a gradient of 0–100% 1 m KCl in Buffer B. HST containing fractions were pooled and dialyzed against PBS (137 mm NaCl, 2.68 mm KCl, 1.47 mmKH2PO4, 8.09 mmNa2HPO4, pH 7.2). Purified proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE analysis and Western blot analysis using a rabbit anti-HST antibody or an immune serum raised against the HIV-1 protease cleavage site peptide. N-terminal sequence determination of the recombinant HST was made using an Applied Biosystems 470A automatic protein sequencer, according to the manufacturer's instructions. Saturation of HST with iron was carried out as follows. Apo-HST was mixed with ferric nitriloacetate (1:3 molar ratio of ferric chloride to nitriloacetic acid, disodium salt) in the presence of 0.5 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, and an excess of bicarbonate (45 mm). The value of 1.48 μg of iron/mg of HST for 100% saturation was used to calculate the amount of iron required for 10 or 100% saturation. For preferential iron loading of the C-lobe, the iron saturation reactions were carried out at pH 6.0 in 0.25 m morpholinoethanesulfonic acid (MOPS) buffer, instead of pH 8.5 in Tris-HCl buffer. To generate the iron-free isoforms, proteins were combined with an equal volume of 100 mmsodium acetate, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm NTA, pH 4, for 30 min on ice. In both cases, salts were removed by extensive dialysis against Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, or PBS. A novel multizone urea-PAGE technique developed by Ali et al. (38Ali S.A. Hammerschmid F. Steinkasserer A. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 238: 93-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar) to resolve the four HST isoforms generated during the iron binding process was used to determine whether the recombinant HST proteins could bind the correct amount of iron. Briefly, apo-HST was incubated with increasing concentrations of ferric-nitriloacetate in the presence of bicarbonate to generate partially and fully saturated isoforms. These isoforms were then separated on polyacrylamide gels containing 6m urea, 0.1 m Tris, 0.01 m boric acid, and 0.05 m EDTA, with an electrode buffer of 0.88m β-alanine and 0.25 m Tris, pH 8.8. Proteins in the gels were visualized by staining with silver. The cell uptake assay used in this study has already been described in our earlier publication (33Ali S.A. Joao H.C. Csonga R. Hammerschmid F. Steinkasserer A. Biochem. J. 1996; 319: 191Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Essentially, CEM T cells (ATCC no. CCL119) normally cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 2 g/liter NaHCO3, 10% FCS (BioWhittaker UK Ltd., Berks, United Kingdom) were serum-starved in RPMI-MOPS medium (RPMI 1640 containing 165 mm MOPS, adjusted to pH 7 with NaOH, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, and glutamine plus antibiotics as indicated earlier) for 2 h prior to the assay. For the assay, 5 × 106 cells were resuspended in 0.5 ml of RPMI-MOPS containing 300 nm recombinant or native HST in either the apo- or holoform and incubated in a 37 °C water bath for 30 min. Cells were then washed in ice-cold PBS to remove free HST. For immunofluorescence, cells were bonded to the surface of adhesion slides (Bio-Rad) and then fixed in 3% formaldehyde in PBS. Cells were permeabilized with 0.1% triton in PBS for 5 min at 22 °C and then in methanol at −20 °C for 3 min. After blocking with bovine serum albumin, immunofluorescence staining was performed with a rabbit polyclonal anti-human transferrin antiserum (BioGenix Laboratories, San Ramon, CA) as primary antibody and a rhodamine-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody (Accurate Chemical and Scientific Co., Westbury, NY) as the secondary antibody. After mounting cells in Bacto FA mounting fluid (Difco), fluorescence was visualized using a fluorescence microscope (Axiovert 10, Zeiss GmbH, Jena, Germany). Samples of 10 ng (2 μl) of each recombinant HST protein, HIV-1 p55Gag and the protease cleavage site peptide VSQNYPIVL were spotted onto nitrocellulose and then subjected to immunodetection analysis using polyclonal antibodies from rabbits immunized with either HST, M289 mutant, the protease cleavage site peptide, or p24Gag. Donkey anti-rabbit F′(ab2) horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was used as the secondary antibody, and the presence of horseradish peroxidase was detected using a commercially available chemiluminescence kit (ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The specific unit activity of the recombinant HIV-1 protease used in these studies was experimentally determined as the minimum amount of the enzyme stock required to totally digest 1 μg of HIV-1 p55Gag in 1 h at 37 °C in 20 μl of HIV-1 protease assay buffer (2 m NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 15% (w/v) glycerol, 0.01% (v/v) Triton X-100, 20 mm MOPS, pH 6.0). Recombinant HST or HIV-1 p55Gag (1 μg) were incubated with a dilution series of recombinant HIV-1 protease in 20-μl volumes of HIV-1 protease assay buffer (see above) at 37 °C for either 1 h or overnight (16 h). Reactants were then separated by SDS-PAGE on 10% gels, and the proteins were visualized by silver staining. After caref"

The biological function of prolyl oligopeptidase is not yet fully understood, but its roles in various biological events have been implicated. Because prolyl oligopeptidase is capable of rapidly degrading many peptide hormones and neuropeptides in vitro (20Wilk S. Life Sci. 1983; 33: 2149-2157Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 21Mentlein R. FEBS Lett. 1988; 234: 251-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar), the enzyme is presumed to be involved in their maturation and degradation. In this connection, the enzyme has attracted special attention from a pharmaceutical viewpoint in the light of the finding that specific enzyme inhibitors reverse scopolamine-induced amnesia in rats (22Yoshimoto T.

In order to define the roles of this enzyme, further studies including a functional characterization of the gene are necessary. Prolyl oligopeptidase has been cloned from several sources including Flavobacterium meningosepticum (33Yoshimoto T. Kanatani A. Shimoda T. Inaoka T. Kokubo T. Tsuru D. J. Biochem.

Biol. 1997; 27: 337-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). However, no gene structure of prolyl oligopeptidase from eukaryotes is available to date. As an initial approach to examining the mechanisms regulating prolyl oligopeptidase gene expression in mammals, we have cloned and characterized the mouse gene encoding prolyl oligopeptidase. In this paper, we describe the structure and chromosome location of the mouse prolyl oligopeptidase gene. In addition to the gene structure, we have characterized the 5′-flanking region of the gene. The results suggest that the gene has a “housekeeping promoter,” characterized by the lack of functional TATA and CAAT boxes as well as the presence of a functional GC-rich promoter region. Poly(A) RNA was prepared from mouse (C57Black/6, female, 8 weeks) brain using the guanidine isothiocyanate-cesium chloride method (38Chirgwin J.M. Przybyla A.E. MacDonald R.J. Rutter W.J. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 5294-5299Crossref PubMed Scopus (16654) Google Scholar) followed by oligo(dT)-cellulose column chromatography. The adapter-ligated cDNA was inserted into λgt10-Eco RI vector (Takara, Japan) and packaged with GIGAPACK II GOLD (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). About 3.4 × 105 clones were screened using the full-length rat prolyl oligopeptidase cDNA previously isolated in our laboratory (the sequence data available from the DDBJ/EBI/GeneBankTM Data Bank with the accession numberAB012759) as a probe by plaque hybridization. Four positive plaques were isolated and sequenced. The complete sequence of the 3′-end was obtained by the 3′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends method (39Frohman M.A. Dush M.K. Martin G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8998-9002Crossref PubMed Scopus (4337) Google Scholar) using the 3′-Full RACE Core Set (Takara). About 5 × 106 clones of the mouse genomic library (C57Black/6, liver, female, 1 year, Stratagene) were screened with the32P-labeled mouse prolyl oligopeptidase cDNA mixture of the five total clones described above. Twelve positive plaques were isolated, and digestion with several restriction enzymes revealed that these plaques included four kinds of clones (P13, P23, P24, and P54). We determined the restriction enzyme maps of these four clones and sequenced the restriction fragments containing exons using ABI automatic sequencers, models 373 and 377 (Perkin-Elmer-Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). The gaps among these four clones were filled by the long and accurate polymerase chain reaction (LA-PCR)1 method (40Barnes W.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2216-2220Crossref PubMed Scopus (980) Google Scholar,41Cheng S. Fockler C. Barnes W.M. Higuchi R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5695-5699Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar). Mouse (C57Black/6, female, 8 weeks) liver was homogenized and treated with 20 μg/ml RNase A and then with 100 μg/ml proteinase K (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). After repeated extraction with phenol, genomic DNA was isolated by ethanol precipitation. The PCR was performed under the following conditions: 1 min at 94 °C, 30 cycles of 10 s at 98 °C and 15 min at 66 °C, and 10 min at 72 °C. A 50-μl portion of the reaction mixture contained 500 ng of genomic DNA, 1 × LA-PCR Buffer II (Mg2+-free), 2.5 mmMgCl2, 0.4 mm dNTP mixture, 10 pmol paired primers, and 2.5 units of LA Taq (Takara). The sense and antisense primer pairs used were as follows: LA21 (filling the gap between P13 and P23), 5′-GCATCCTGCCTGGTCTCAGCTTTAATTCTG-3′ (identical to 1471–1501 bp downstream of exon 2), and 5′-TAGGGGCAGCTTCACTATTGTGGAGCTTTC-3′ (complementary to 10.7 kb upstream of exon 3; LA78 (filling the gap between P23 and P24), 5′-AAAGCATGAACACCCCAGAGATCAGTTTCG-3′ (identical to 223–253 bp downstream of exon 6), and 5′-CATCTTGGTGATAGTCAACGAGGAGTACACAACC-3′ (complementary to 185–219 upstream of exon 9); and LA105 (filling the gap between P24 and P54), 5′-GGTTTACAATCACTGACGCTTAGGACCTCCTG-3′ (identical to 3088–3120 bp downstream of exon 10), and 5′-GAGTGGCTGACTTGGCTGGATTCTTTTCTC-3′ (complementary to 1074–1104 bp upstream of exon 11). The PCR products were analyzed by restriction enzyme mapping and sequencing. 1 μg of mouse brain poly(A) RNA or 50 μg of Escherichia coli transfer RNA was hybridized at 75 °C for 90 min in a total 20 μl of 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 1 mm EDTA, and 0.25 m KCl with 2 pmol of the oligonucleotide probes, PE1, 5′-CGTGCGAGCGGGCGAGCGG-3′ (+306 to +288), PE2, 5′-ACAAGAGGGAGCGGAGTCGC-3′ (+182 to +163), or PE3, 5′-TGAGCAACACTGTTCCTGAG-3′ (−320 to −339), which had been endo-labeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase (Takara) and [γ-32P]ATP at 37 °C for 30 min. The reactions were then allowed to cool for 90 min at room temperature. After adding 46 μl of 65 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 4.3 mmMgCl2, 15 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.72 mm dNTP mixture, 200 units of Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.) was introduced into the reaction mixture, which was then incubated at 42 °C for 60 min. The reactions were phenol-extracted, ethanol-precipitated, and electrophoresed in a denaturing 6% polyacrylamide sequencing gel along with a sequence ladder generated with the unlabeled primers using [α-32P]dCTP and Sequenase version 2.0 (U.S. Biochemical Corp.). The dried gel was visualized by autoradiography. A 914-bp Eco RI-Bam HI fragment probe (nucleotides −541 to +373) was 5′-endo-labeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase (Takara) and [γ-32P]ATP. The denatured probe (2 × 105 cpm) was hybridized to 50 μg of mouse brain total RNA or E. coli transfer RNA in 80% formamide, 0.4 mNaCl, 40 mm PIPES, and 1 mm EDTA at 62 °C for 16 h. After hybridization, the mixture was digested with 800 units of S1 nuclease (Takara) at room temperature for 20 min. The protected fragments were analyzed on a 5% polyacrylamide sequencing gel. The 1-kb ladder (Life Technologies, Inc.) was endo-labeled and used as a size marker. Mouse genome DNA was extracted as described above. 5 μg of the genomic DNA was completely digested with Eco RI, Hin dIII, Bam HI, and Xba I. The DNA was fractionated on a 0.7% agarose gel and alkaline-transferred to a Nytran membrane (Schleicher & Schuell). The blot was hybridized at 60 °C for 16 h in 6× SSPE, 5× Denhardt's solution, 1% SDS, 10% dextran sulfate, and 100 μg/ml denatured herring sperm DNA with a 32P-labeled 262-bp Hin dIII-Bam HI fragment of mouse prolyl oligopeptidase cDNA, which is included in exon 15. The membrane was washed at 60 °C in 0.1× SSC/0.1% SDS and exposed to Kodak Biomax film. Metaphase spreads were prepared from concanavalin A-stimulated splenocytes of normal male mice after bromodeoxyuridine incorporation. R-banding was obtained by exposure of the slides to ultraviolet light after staining with Hoechst 33258. A 200-ng sample of probe mixture (P13, P23, P54, LA78, and LA105) was labeled with biotinylated-16-dUTP (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) by nick translation. Prior to hybridization, the chromosome slides were denatured in 70% formamide in 2× SSC at 75 °C and immediately chilled in 70% ethanol (0 °C) and dehydrated. The probe was mixed with 2 μg of mouse Cot-1 DNA (Life Technologies, Inc.) and denatured in formamide at 75 °C. The hybridization was carried out at 42 °C for 48 h in 4× SSC, 4 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 20% dextran sulfate. The signal was detected by sequential incubation with 3 μg/ml anti-biotin goat IgG (Vectashield Vector laboratory, Burlingame, CA) and 40 μg/ml fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-goat IgG (American Qualex, La Mirada, CA). Fluorescein isothiocyanate signals were further amplified with 40 μg/ml Alexa 488 conjugated anti-fluorescein isothiocyanate (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). To construct promoter and reporter fusion constructs, different portions of the 5′-flanking region sequences were synthesized by PCR. The PCR was conducted in a total 50-μl volume of 100 ng of template plasmid clone containing the 5′-flanking region, 1× Ex Taq buffer, 0.2 mmdNTP mixture, 10 pmol paired primers, and 2.5 units Ex Taq (Takara). The reactions were performed under the following conditions: 1 min at 94 °C and 30 cycles of 30 s at 98 °C, 30 s at 60 °C, and 3 min at 72 °C. The downstream primers were 5′-CGCGGATCCTACACGTCGGGGTACTGGAA-3′ (+406 to +387), 5′-CGCGGATCCGCGCCAAGCAGGAAGACGCT-3′ (+249 to +230), 5′-CGCGGATCCACAAGAGGGAGCGGAGTCGC-3′ (+182 to +163), and 5′-CGCGGATCCACCAGCCACTCTGTATATGG-3′ (−62 to −81). The upstream primers were 5′-CCGGAATTCGAGGCCCATGGATAGAGAAG-3′ (−422 to −403), 5′-CCGGAATTCAAGTTCTCTCACCTCGCTCC-3′ (−256 to −237), 5′-CCGGAATTCGGCTGGTGGCAGGCAGGCGG-3′ (−68 to −49), and 5′-CCGGAATTCTCCCTCTTGTCGCCGCTTGG-3′ (+173 to +154). The PCR products were sequenced and subcloned into pEGFP-1 vector (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) at Eco RI-Bam HI site. The whole promoter sequence (−541 to +373) was subcloned from the plasmid clone containing the 5′-flanking region at Eco RI-Bam HI site. The African green monkey kidney SV40 transformed cell line (COS1, RCB0143) was purchased from Riken Gene Bank (Tsukuba, Japan). The cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplied with 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone, Logan, UT), 0.3 mg/ml l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin (Life Technologies, Inc.). When the cells in 75-cm2 flasks become confluent, they were trypsinized with 0.25% trypsin/0.5 mm EDTA and transferred into 10-cm dishes in the same medium at an initial concentration of 1 × 106 cells/dish. The cells were cultured for 24 h and transfected by a calcium phosphate precipitation procedure (42Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, Suppl. 14. Wiley Interscience, New York1992: 9.1Google Scholar) with 20 μg of plasmids and 20 μg of pSV-β-Gal (Promega, Madison, WI). The transfected cells were further cultured for 48 h. The harvested cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, suspended in 2 ml/dish of phosphate-buffered saline, and disrupted by the freeze-thawing method. After centrifugation at 8000 × g for 10 min, the supernatant was collected for use in the following assays. The green fluorescent protein (GFP) activity was measured by spectrofluorometry using an excitation wavelength of 488 nm and an emission wavelength of 507 nm. The β-galactosidase assay was carried out as described by standard protocols (43Rosenthal N. Method Enzymol. 1987; 152: 704-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). The GFP activity was normalized by β-galactosidase activity. We isolated four clones of P13 (13.0 kb), P23 (19.0 kb), P24 (11.0 kb), and P54 (20.9 kb) by screening the genomic library. Because these four clones were found to neither encode the 7th and 8th exon nor overlap one another, the LA-PCR method was used to fill the gaps between them. Three LA-PCR products, LA21 (7.0 kb), LA78 (21.9 kb), and LA105 (18.2 kb), were generated for the respective gaps. Consequently, these overlapping seven clones spanned a length approximately 99.1 kb long containing 91.9 kb of the complete prolyl oligopeptidase gene (Fig. 1). The genome contained 15 exons ranging from 75 (2nd exon) to 767 bp (15th exon) in size and 14 introns ranging from 1535 to 22.3 kb. All donor and acceptor splicing sequences had consensus GT and AG dinucleotides, respectively (Table I).Table IExon-intron organizationExon numberExon sizeSequence at exon/intron junctionPhaseIntron size5′ splice donor3′ splice acceptorbp1422CTCCgtgagtacttttgcagGTGC04678 bp SerVal275TAAGgtaattctctctgcagGCTT019.1 kb LysAla3134AGCGgtaggtgggtccccagGTAC21535 bpArgTyr4131CGAGgtaggtgcccccgtagGTTA12188 bpArgGly5210GATGgtacgtgattcttcagGCAC12202 bpAspGly6122TGAGgtaccgtactttgtagCTAT09.9 kb GluLeu7106ACCGgtaagtcacttcccagGAAT16.9 kbThrGly8192TTAGgtaaggcacatttcagAATG15.6 kbLeuGlu9198CCAGgtgagggcccctctagGTGT14.8 kbProGly10104CCAGgtatggactgttgtagATTT022.3 kb GlnIle11137ACAGgtaagcattttctcagCGTG2231 bpSerVal1295AAAGgtgagctgctttgtagGTGG1 252 bpLysGly13132GTAGgtgagaccgtctttagCTGC12329 bpValAla14157TCAAgtatgtttcctcgtagATAC22559 bpLysTyr15767TGGG Open table in a new tab A very recent study by Fülöp et al. (2Fülöp V. Böcskei Z. Polgár L. Cell. 1998; 94: 161-170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar) has established the tertiary structure of porcine muscle prolyl oligopeptidase. The enzyme contains a peptidase domain with an α/β hydrolase fold, and the active site is covered by the central tunnel of a unique β-propeller (2Fülöp V. Böcskei Z. Polgár L. Cell. 1998; 94: 161-170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). Although the three-dimensional structure of the mouse prolyl oligopeptidase has not yet been determined, it should be very similar to that of the porcine enzyme based on the remarkable similarities in the amino acid sequences of the two enzymes (29Ishino T. Ohtsuki S. Homma K. Natori S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1998; 123: 540-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Therefore, we have considered the relationship between the protein and gene structures for the mouse prolyl oligopeptidase, assuming that the mouse enzyme has basically the same catalytic and noncatalytic domain organization (Fig. 1). The catalytic domain (or peptidase domain) is composed of residues 1–72 and 428–710. This domain is encoded by exons 1–3 for the amino-terminal portion and exons 10–15 for the carboxyl-terminal portion. Exon 15, the longest exon encoding the carboxyl-terminal 98 amino acid residues and the 3′-untranslated regions, contains two catalytic triad residues (Asp642 and His680) of the mouse prolyl oligopeptidase. The active site serine residue (Ser554) is encoded by exon 13. On the other hand, the noncatalytic domain corresponding to residues 73–427 is encoded by exons 3–10. A structural feature of this domain is a 7-fold repeat of four-stranded antiparallel β-sheets forming a β-propeller domain with seven blades (2Fülöp V. Böcskei Z. Polgár L. Cell. 1998; 94: 161-170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). These repeating units at the peptide level are not encoded by individual exons. The mouse prolyl oligopeptidase gene contains two large introns, intron 2 (19.1 kb) and intron 10 (22.3 kb), resulting in a distribution of the exons in three clusters (Fig. 1). In a general way, the first and last clusters of the exons are responsible for the peptidase domain, whereas the middle one is responsible for the β-propeller domain. Such an exon-intron organization may indicate that prolyl oligopeptidase has evolved from the insertion of the propeller domain into the NH2-terminal region of the peptidase domain. Ishino et al. (29Ishino T. Ohtsuki S. Homma K. Natori S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1998; 123: 540-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) have recently reported the nucleotide sequence of mouse prolyl oligopeptidase cDNA. We also cloned the cDNA, and our results confirmed their data, except that the sequence in the 5′-untranslated region was totally different. To explain this conflict and to establish a basis for primer extension experiments and promoter analysis of the gene, we conducted reverse transcriptase-PCR and LA-PCR using different sets of primers. The results showed that the PCR product was amplified only when using the synthesized primer sets based on the sequences of our clone (data not shown). The real proof of the accuracy of our cDNA sequence was its correspondence to the genomic sequence. The precise location of the transcription initiation site of the mouse prolyl oligopeptidase gene was determined by the primer extension analysis. Using the primer PE1, one major band and two minor bands were detected (Fig. 2 a). From this result, one of the minor sites was determined to be thymine (+139). Because the major and the other minor bands were far upstream of the PE1 primer site, we newly designed two primers, PE2 and PE3, respectively, for further analysis. The results of experiments with these primers indicated that the major start site is the thymine (+1) (Fig. 2 b) and the minor site is the guanine (−408) (Fig.2 c). To further confirm these findings, we conducted an S1 nuclease mapping experiment. As shown in Fig.3, a major protected band was found in a position corresponding to 235 bp, confirming that thymine (+139) is an important transcription initiation site. This result along with the results of the primer extension analyses indicates that both thymines (+1 and +139) are important initiation sites in the transcription of the mouse prolyl oligopeptidase gene (Fig.4).Figure 3Identification of the major transcription initiation site by S1 nuclease mapping. A 914-bp Eco RI-Bam HI fragment was 5′-endo-labeled and hybridized to mouse brain total RNA (lane 3) or E. coli transfer RNA (lane 4). After S1 nuclease digestion, the products were fractionated by electrophoresis and visualized by autoradiography. The endo-labeled size marker (lane 1) and the probe (lane 2) were also electrophoresed. The marker sizes are shown on the left.

The Bam HI sites are shown in italic type, and the translation initiation codon (ATG) is in bold type.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Although there is a TATAAT motif 915 bp upstream of ATG, this motif could not work as a TATA box because the upstream minor transcription initiation site is too distant from the motif. Consistent with these observations is the presence of a consensus motif GCTCC(C/G) at four positions in the sequence covering the nucleotides from −408 to the ATG codon (Fig. 4). This motif is known as a multiple start site element downstream (MED-1), which is detectable in many TATA-less promoters with multiple start sites (44Ince T.A. Scotto K.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30249-30252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). This region is rich in G+C and contains potential binding sites for several transcription factors such as Sp1, Ap2, and E4TF. With the Southern hybridization analysis, a single hybridization-positive band was detected when mouse genomic DNA was digested with four independent restriction enzymes (Fig.5). Fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis showed a single positive signal on chromosome 10B2-B3, and no other signal was detected (Fig.6). This result is consistent with the mapping of the human prolyl oligopeptidase gene to human chromosome 6q22 (45Goossens F.J. Wauters J.G. Vanhoof G.C. Bossuyt P.J. Schatteman K.A. Loens K. Scharpé S.L. Cytogenet. Cell Genet. 1996; 74: 99-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), because this region of mouse chromosome 10 shares a region of synteny with human chromosome 6. These results indicate that the mouse prolyl oligopeptidase is a single-copy gene located on chromosome 10B2-B3.Figure 6Chromosomal localization of mouse prolyl oligopeptidase gene.

https://openalex.org/W1999398674,"Target substrate-specific hammerhead ribozyme cleaves the specific mRNA and results in the inhibition of gene expression. In humans, overproduction of apolipoprotein B (apoB) is positively associated with premature coronary artery diseases. To modulate apoB gene expression, we designed hammerhead ribozymes targeted at AUA6665↓ and GUA6679↓ of apoB mRNA, designated RB16 and RB15, respectively, and investigated their effects on apoB mRNA in HepG2 cells. The results demonstrated that RB15 and RB16 ribozyme RNAs cleaved apoB RNA efficiently in vitro. Both ribozymes, RB15 and RB16, were used to construct recombinant adenoviral vectors, designated AvRB15 and AvRB16, respectively, for in vivo gene transfer. HepG2 cells were infected with 2 × 105plaque-forming units of AvRB15 for 5, 10, 15, and 24 h. An RNase protection assay showed that the expression of the RB15 transcript was time-dependent; it increased ∼300-fold from 5 to 24 h. Using reverse ligation-mediated polymerase chain reaction, the 3′ cleavage product of apoB mRNA was detected, and the exact cleavage site of apoB mRNA was confirmed by sequencing. Importantly, the levels of apoB mRNA in HepG2 cells decreased ∼80% after AvRB15 infection. Pulse/chase experiments on HepG2 cells treated with AvRB15 and AvRB16 demonstrated that ribozyme cleavage produced a truncated protein that was secreted at a density of 1.063–1.210 g/ml. The cleavage activity of RB15 on apoB mRNA was more efficient than that of RB16. Moreover, pulse/chase experiments in HepG2 cells treated with AvRB15 revealed that most of the truncated apoB protein was degraded intracellularly. We conclude that hammerhead ribozyme targeted at GUA6679↓ of apoB mRNA cleaves apoB mRNA, results in decreased apoB mRNA levels, and generates a truncated apoB of the expected size in vivo. Thus, the therapeutic application of ribozyme in regulating apoB production holds promise. Target substrate-specific hammerhead ribozyme cleaves the specific mRNA and results in the inhibition of gene expression. In humans, overproduction of apolipoprotein B (apoB) is positively associated with premature coronary artery diseases. To modulate apoB gene expression, we designed hammerhead ribozymes targeted at AUA6665↓ and GUA6679↓ of apoB mRNA, designated RB16 and RB15, respectively, and investigated their effects on apoB mRNA in HepG2 cells. The results demonstrated that RB15 and RB16 ribozyme RNAs cleaved apoB RNA efficiently in vitro. Both ribozymes, RB15 and RB16, were used to construct recombinant adenoviral vectors, designated AvRB15 and AvRB16, respectively, for in vivo gene transfer. HepG2 cells were infected with 2 × 105plaque-forming units of AvRB15 for 5, 10, 15, and 24 h. An RNase protection assay showed that the expression of the RB15 transcript was time-dependent; it increased ∼300-fold from 5 to 24 h. Using reverse ligation-mediated polymerase chain reaction, the 3′ cleavage product of apoB mRNA was detected, and the exact cleavage site of apoB mRNA was confirmed by sequencing. Importantly, the levels of apoB mRNA in HepG2 cells decreased ∼80% after AvRB15 infection. Pulse/chase experiments on HepG2 cells treated with AvRB15 and AvRB16 demonstrated that ribozyme cleavage produced a truncated protein that was secreted at a density of 1.063–1.210 g/ml. The cleavage activity of RB15 on apoB mRNA was more efficient than that of RB16. Moreover, pulse/chase experiments in HepG2 cells treated with AvRB15 revealed that most of the truncated apoB protein was degraded intracellularly. We conclude that hammerhead ribozyme targeted at GUA6679↓ of apoB mRNA cleaves apoB mRNA, results in decreased apoB mRNA levels, and generates a truncated apoB of the expected size in vivo. Thus, the therapeutic application of ribozyme in regulating apoB production holds promise. apolipoprotein B polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis polymerase chain reaction reverse ligation-mediated PCR very low density lipoprotein intermediate density lipoprotein low density lipoprotein high density lipoprotein human hepatoma cell line plaque-forming unit(s) kilobase(s) Eagle's minimum essential medium small nuclear RNA bovine serum albumin glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase Apolipoprotein B (apoB)1is a large hydrophobic protein that is synthesized in the liver and small intestine of mammals. ApoB plays an essential, although incompletely understood, role in the assembly and secretion of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins, chylomicrons, and very low density lipoproteins (VLDLs). It also functions in the catabolic clearance of low density lipoprotein (LDL), the major plasma cholesterol transport vehicle in humans (1Breslow J.L. Physiol. Rev. 1988; 68: 85-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Mammalian apoB exists in two forms, apoB100 and apoB48 (2Kane J.P. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1983; 45: 637-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Both are products of a single gene, which is expressed and processed in a tissue- and species-specific fashion (3Chen S.-H. Habib G. Yang C.-Y. Gu Z.-W. Lee B.R. Weng S.-A. Silberman S.R. Cai S.-J. Deslypere J.P. Rosseneu M. Gotto A.M.J. Li W.-H. Chan L.

Cell. 1987; 50: 831-840Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar). In humans, apoB100 is produced in the liver and assembled as part of VLDL, which is metabolized in the circulation to intermediate density lipoprotein (IDL) and finally to LDL. Unlike other mammalian apolipoproteins, apoB100 does not exchange between lipoprotein particles during this metabolic process and is present in LDL as the sole protein component. Elevated plasma concentrations of apoB100 and LDL are established risk factors for atherosclerotic coronary disease (5Sniderman A.D. Shapiro S. Marpole D. Skinner B. Teng B.B. Kwiterovich P.O.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 604-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar). Patients with familial hypercholesterolemia, familial defective apoB100, and familial combined hyperlipidemia or hyperapobetalipoproteinemia all suffer from either overproduction of apoB100 or decreased clearance of apoB100. The most common of these disorders, familial combined hyperlipidemia, affects 150 of the population and is the result of overproduction of apoB100. On the other hand, heterozygous individuals with familial hypobetalipoproteinemia have reduced levels of apoB100, and their plasma LDL cholesterol levels are less than half of normal. Moreover, they appear to be protected from atherosclerotic disease (6Kahn J.A. Glueck C.J. JAMA. 1978; 240: 47-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Familial hypobetalipoproteinemia is characterized by the presence of truncated apoB produced by one of the alleles, and the levels of truncated apoB are barely detectable (7Farese R.V.J. Linton M.F. Young S.G. J. Int. Med. 1992; 231: 643-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In most cases, the underlying mechanism for the reduced apoB concentration is unclear; it could be the result of an inability of the truncated apoB variants to assemble and be secreted as normal triglyceride-rich lipoprotein. Truncated apoB may be preferentially degraded intracellularly. Alternatively, secreted truncated forms of apoB lipoprotein particles may be rapidly cleared from the circulation, as demonstrated with the apoB50 lipoprotein particle (8Hardman D.A. Pullinger C.R. Hamilton R.L. Kane J.P. Malloy M.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 88: 1722-1729Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Kinetic turnover studies of apoB89 showed an increased catabolic rate (9Parhofer K.G. Daugherty A. Kinoshita M. Schonfeld G. J. Lipid Res. 1992; 31: 2001-2007Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar), whereas affected individuals with apoB75 had diminished production and increased catabolism (10Krul E.S. Parhofer K.G. Barrett H.R. Wagner D.R. Schonfeld G. J. Lipid Res. 1992; 33: 1037-1050Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Transgenic mice expressing apoB83 had decreased apoB83 mRNA levels, and reduced apoB83 secretion that was removed rapidly from the plasma compared with apoB100 (11Kim E. Cham C.M. Veniant M.M. Ambroziak P. Young S.G. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 1468-1477Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).We sought to develop a gene therapy strategy to decrease apoB100 production and to alter lipoprotein metabolism for the prevention of coronary artery disease. In this context, the reduction of gene expression using the hammerhead ribozyme is an attractive approach. Ribozymes are small RNA molecules with enzymatic RNA cleaving activity (12Symons R.H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 641-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). Several ribozyme classes (or catalytic motifs) have been identified, each mediating a naturally occurring biological process. The hammerhead ribozyme self-cleaves at a specific phosphodiester bond to produce 2′,3′-cyclic phosphate and 5′-hydroxyl termin (13Froster A.C. Symons R.H. Cell. 1987; 49: 211-220Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar, 14Hutchins C.J. Rathjen P.D. Forster A.C. Symons R.H.

Nature. 1987; 328: 596-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (866) Google Scholar) and Haseloff and Gerlach (16Haseloff J. Gerlach W.L. Nature. 1988; 334: 585-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (956) Google Scholar) engineered substrate-specific hammerhead ribozymes that efficiently cleave target substrate RNAs in trans. A ribozyme designed for cleavage of specific RNAs in trans contains three components: 1) a 3-nucleotide target sequence (NUX) where N represents any base and X represents A, C, or U; 2) a conservative catalytic domain, and 3) flanking sequences complementary to the substrate RNA. Such ribozymes can perform an enzymatic reaction in which a target substrate RNA is cleaved and the ribozyme itself is not altered during the reaction. Recently, substrate-specific hammerhead ribozymes have been used to down-regulate gene expression in vitro and in vivo (17Birikh J.R. Heaton P.A. Eckstein F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 245: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Target-specific ribozymes have been shown to cleave and lower HIV RNA (18Bertrand E. Rossi J. Eckstein F. Lilley D.M.J.

EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4411-4418Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) and leukocyte-type 12-lipoxygenase in vascular smooth muscle cells (21Gu J.-L. Veerapanane D. Rossi J. Natarajan R. Thomas L. Nadler J. Circ. Res. 1995; 77: 14-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Hammerhead ribozymes have also been used to create target-specific transgenic flies to alter the phenotype (22Zhao J.J. Pick L. Nature. 1993; 365: 448-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) and transgenic mice to inhibit gene expression (23L'Huillier P.J. Soulier S. Stinnakre M.-G. Lepourry L. Davis S.R. Mercier J.-C.

It is synthesized in the small intestine and is an important component for the assembly and secretion of chylomicrons. Both the LDL receptor binding domain (which is essential for the cellular uptake of LDL) and the attachment site of apolipoprotein(a) (which is essential for the formation of lipoprotein(a), a highly atherogenic lipoprotein) are located in the carboxyl-terminal portion of apoB100, which is missing in apoB48. Therefore, the absence of the carboxyl-terminal half of apoB100 in apoB48 has profound functional consequences. A recent study provided evidence that the production of apoB48 limits the accumulation of cholesterol-enriched LDL, thus decreasing the formation of atherosclerotic lesions (26Powell-Braxton L. Veniant M. Latvala R.D. Hirano K.-I. Won W.B. Ross J. Dybdal N. Zlot C.H. Young S.G. Davidson N.O. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 934-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar).In this study, we designed hammerhead ribozymes targeted at apoB mRNA sequences of GUA6679↓ and AUA6665↓, flanking the edited base C6666. The study demonstrates that the hammerhead ribozyme cleaves apoB mRNA at the precise target site and decreases the levels of apoB mRNA. Furthermore, ribozyme cleavage produces a truncated protein of the expected size.MATERIALS AND METHODSConstruction of Plasmid VectorsApoB mRNA-specific Hammerhead RibozymesOligonucleotides used for engineering apoB mRNA-specific hammerhead ribozymes were synthesized at the core facility at Baylor College of Medicine. Briefly, sense and antisense strands of oligonucleotides of apoB mRNA-specific hammerhead ribozyme were annealed and cloned into Xba I and Cla I sites of a pGem 7Zf(+) vector (Promega, Madison, WI). Each construct was sequenced with Sequenase II (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in the presence of single strand DNA-binding protein (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Constructs of target sequences of AUA6665↓ and GUA6679↓ are designated pRB16 and pRB15, respectively. A point mutant of the conserved catalytic domain at nucleotide G5 → A (G5A) of the RB15 construct is designated the pRB15 mutant, and the numbering of the conserved catalytic domain is according to Hertel et al. (27Hertel K.J. Pardi A. Uhlenbeck O.C. Koizumi M. Ohtsuka E. Uesugi S. Cedergren R. Eckstein F. Gerlach W.L. Hodgeson R. Symons R.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 3252Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). The sequences of ribozymes RB15 and RB16 are available by request to the corrosponding author. The numbering of apoB corresponds to the published human apoB100 sequence (28Knott T.J. Wallis S.C. Powell L.M. Pease R.J. Lusis A.J. Blackhart B. McCarthy B.J. Mahley R.W. Levy-Wilson B. Scott J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 7501-7503Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) (GenBankTM accession number X04506).U6 snRNA ConstructThe U6 snRNA cDNA construct was kindly supplied by Dr. Ramachandra Reddy of Baylor College of Medicine. The DNA fragment of U6 snRNA (110 base pairs) was cloned into pGem7Zf(+) (pU6) and used to generate a U6 snRNA probe for the quantitation of U6 snRNA transcripts by an RNase protection assay. The anti-U6 snRNA probe of 143 nucleotides was produced by Eco RI-linearized pU6 using Sp6 RNA polymerase.Human ApoB ConstructpB3, containing a human apoB cDNA fragment of nucleotides 4953–5602 in pGem7Zf(+), was used to generate the antisense apoB probe for the quantitation of apoB transcripts by the RNase protection assay. The anti-B3 probe of 721 nucleotides was produced by Xba I-linearized pB3 using T7 RNA polymerase.In Vitro Transcription ReactionFor synthesis of in vitro transcripts, a maxiscript kit from Ambion (Austin, TX) was used. Briefly, a linearized DNA template (2 μg) was incubated in 20 μl of transcription buffer containing 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 6 mmMgCl2, 20 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mmATP, 5 mm CTP, 5 mm GTP, 5 mm UTP, 40 units of RNase inhibitor, and 10 units of RNA polymerase. The reaction was carried out at 37 °C for 1–2 h, the DNA template was removed by incubation with 2 units of RNase-free DNase I at 37 °C for 30 min, and the RNA was recovered after phenol/chloroform, followed by ethanol precipitation with ammonium acetate. For synthesis of the radiolabeled transcript, 50 μCi of [32P]UTP (10 mCi/ml, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was used instead of UTP. At the end of the reaction, the free nucleotides were removed using the nick column method (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech).In Vitro Ribozyme Cleavage ReactionControl ribozyme RNA corresponding to sense apoB RNA was synthesized from the ribozyme plasmid vectors pRB15 and pRB16 (Xba I-linearized) using T7 RNA polymerase. Synthetic ribozyme RNA corresponding to antisense apoB RNA (Hin dIII-linearized) was produced using Sp6 RNA polymerase. The concentration of synthetic ribozyme RNA was determined by measuring optical density at 260 nm. pGem-CAA, containing a human apoB cDNA fragment (nucleotides 6506–7335) (29Teng B.B. Verp M. Salomon J. Davidson N.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20616-20620Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was used to transcribe a32P-radiolabeled 829-nucleotide synthetic apoB RNA (pGem-CAA linearized with Hin dIII) using T7 RNA polymerase in the presence of [32P]UTP (10 mCi/ml, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The in vitro ribozyme cleavage reaction was performed using 1 × 105 cpm32P-labeled apoB RNA as substrate and 2 μg of ribozyme RNA in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 20 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm EDTA. The reaction was carried out for 1–2 h at either 37 or 50 °C as indicated. The products were analyzed using 5% polyacrylamide urea gel electrophoresis. The gel was autoradiographed and quantitated using a PhosphorImager SF scanner (Molecular Dynamics, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA).Reverse Ligation-mediated PCR (RL-PCR)Synthesis of the RNA LinkerThe following two synthetic oligonucleotides were annealed and used for synthesis of the RNA linker using T7 RNA polymerase: bottom, 5′-TTTCAGCGAGGGTCAGCCTATGCCCTATAGTGAGTCGTATTA; top, 5′-TAATACGACTCACTATAG. The synthesized RNA linker was used to ligate the phosphorylated apoB mRNA after ribozyme cleavage.DNA PrimersThree DNA primers 3′ of the RB15 ribozyme cleavage site GUA6679↓ were selected, as suggested by Bertrand et al. (30Bertrand E. Fromont-Racine M. Pictet R. Grange T. Turner P.C. Methods in Molecular Biology. 74. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ1997: 311-323Google Scholar). Primer 1 (P1, 5′-TCAATGATTTCATCAATAATA), corresponding to human apoB cDNA nucleotides 6728–6748, was used for reverse transcription. Primer 2 (P2, 5′-AGCTATTTTCAAATCATGTAA), corresponding to human apoB cDNA nucleotides 6699–6719, was used as the downstream primer for PCR amplification. Primer 4 (P4, 5′-CAAATCATGTAAATCATAAC), corresponding to human apoB cDNA nucleotides 6691–6711, was used for sequencing.RL-PCRTotal cellular RNA (0.7 mg) after ribozyme cleavage was phosphorylated at the 5′-OH end using T4 polynucleotide kinase (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The phosphorylated RNA was ligated with RNA linker (100 μg/ml) using T4 RNA ligase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). After ligation, cDNA was synthesized using avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.) with the P1 primer, followed by PCR using the downstream primer (P2) and the upstream primer (DNA linker primer, 5′-GGGCATAGGCTGACCCTCGCT) that is complementary to the RNA linker. This PCR product can be detected either by using 32P-end-labeled primer P2 or by ethidium bromide visualization after analysis with 8% polyacrylamide-urea gel electrophoresis.SequencingNonradioactive primers, P2 and DNA linker primer, were used to produce the PCR product for sequencing. After amplification, the PCR product was treated with 15 units of exonuclease (10 units/μl) and 3 units of shrimp alkaline phosphatase (2 units/μl) to remove the primers and free nucleotides. The purified PCR product was sequenced using the sequencing primer P4 with the Thermo Sequenase radiolabeled terminator cycle sequencing kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The sequenced product was analyzed on 8% polyacrylamide-urea gel and detected by autoradiogram.Construction of Recombinant Adenoviral Ribozyme VectorsApoB mRNA-specific hammerhead ribozymes, RB15, RB16, and RB15 mutant, were cloned into the adenoviral shuttle vector, pAvS6, which contains a Rous sarcoma virus promoter as described by Teng et al. (31Teng B.-B. Blumenthal S. Forte T. Navaratnam N. Scott J. Gotto Jr., A.M. Chan L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29395-29404Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The recombinant adenovirus was prepared by co-transfection of pAvS6 containing apoB mRNA-specific hammerhead ribozyme and pJM17 into 293 cells. Adenoviral vectors containing apoB mRNA-specific ribozymes were plaque-purified on these cells. High titer recombinant adenovirus was amplified on 293 cells and purified by CsCl gradient centrifugation as described previously by Teng et al. (31Teng B.-B. Blumenthal S. Forte T. Navaratnam N. Scott J. Gotto Jr., A.M. Chan L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29395-29404Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recombinant adenovirus Av1LacZ4 was supplied by Genetic Therapy Inc. (Gaithersburg, MD). It has the same structure as AvRB15 except that it contains a 3.1-kb nuclear targeted β-galactosidase cDNA insert instead of ribozyme.Cell Culture and Recombinant Adenovirus InfectionCell CultureHuman hepatoma cell line (HepG2) was cultured in Eagle's minimum essential medium (EMEM) containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mg/ml glutamine, 50 units/ml penicillin, 50 mg/ml streptomycin, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, and 0.1 mm nonessential amino acids at 37 °C with 5% CO2. HepG2 cells were plated onto six-well culture dishes until the cells reached 80% confluency. The cells were infected with 2 × 105 pfu of AvRB15, AvRB16, and AvRB15 mutant as indicated in each experiment.Quantitation of the Levels of Ribozyme RB15 RNA and ApoB mRNA after AvRB15 InfectionHepG2 cells were plated as described above. The cells were infected with 2 × 105 pfu of AvRB15 for 5, 10, 15, and 24 h. At each time point, RNA was extracted from cells using an Ultraspec RNA kit (Biotecx Laboratory Inc., Houston, TX). The expression levels of RB15 RNA and apoB mRNA in the cells were quantitated using an RNase protection RPA II kit (Ambion). Briefly, an RB15 RNA probe of 102 nucleotides was produced from the pRB15 vector (linearized with Xba I) using Sp6 RNA polymerase in the presence of [32P]UTP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The RNase protection assay was carried out with 10 μg of total RNA and 3 × 104 cpm of probe in 20 μl of hybridization buffer. The mixture was incubated at 45 °C overnight. At the end of this reaction, the mixture was treated with 100 μl of RNase digestion buffer containing RNase A and RNase T1 for 30 min at 37 °C. The protected RNA fragment (59 nucleotides) was precipitated and analyzed with 8% polyacrylamide-urea gel electrophoresis and quantitated using a PhosphorImager SF scanner.To determine the levels of apoB mRNA after AvRB15 infection, a32P-labeled antisense apoB RNA probe of 721 nucleotides was produced from the pB3 vector (linearized with Xba I) using T7 RNA polymerase in the presence of [32P]UTP (10 mCi/ml, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The RNase protection assay was performed as described above. After RNase digestion, the protected fragment of 640 nucleotides was analyzed with 5% polyacrylamide-urea gel electrophoresis and quantitated using the PhosphorImager SF scanner.Quantitation of the Levels of RB15 RNA in Nucleus and Cytoplasm Fractions after AvRB15 InfectionCytoplasmic RNA ExtractionHepG2 cells were plated onto 10-cm culture dishes and infected with 5 × 105 pfu of AvRB15 for 15 h. Cytoplasmic RNAs were extracted as described by Bertrand et al. (32Bertrand E. Castanotto D. Zhou C. Carbonnelle C. Lee N.S. Good P. Chatterjee S. Grange T. Pictet R. Kohn D. Engelke D. Rossi J.J. RNA. 1997; 3: 75-88PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 1000 rpm for 5 min, rinsed with ice-cold PBS, and resuspended in RNA extraction buffer (140 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 40 units of RNasin). The samples were placed on ice for 5 min, and centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 90 s. The supernatant was treated at 37 °C for 30 min with proteinase K (50 μg/ml) in a digestion buffer containing 0.2 m Tris, pH 8.0, 25 mmEDTA, 0.3 m NaCl, and 2% SDS. Cytoplasmic RNA was extracted using phenol/chloroform and precipitated with ethanol.Nuclear RNA ExtractionAfter AvRB15 infection, the cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and resuspended in buffer H (15 mm NaCl, 60 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, and 5% sucrose). The cells were then homogenized using a Dounce homogenizer (pestle A, six gentle strokes) to release the nuclei. The nuclei were purified by centrifugation (3500 × g for 20 min) through a 10% sucrose cushion (buffer H without Nonidet P-40, containing 10% sucrose). Nuclear RNA was extracted using phenol/chloroform and precipitated with ethanol.Quantitation of RB15 RNA and U6 snRNA by RNase Protection AssayCytoplasmic RNAs (10 μg) and nuclear RNAs (10 μg), prepared as described above, were used to quantitate RB15 RNA and U6 snRNA by RNase protection assay (Ambion). The method for the quantitation of RB15 RNA has been described already. To measure the levels of U6 snRNA, a 32P-labeled anti-U6 snRNA probe of 143 nucleotides was produced from the pU6 vector (linearized with Eco RI) using Sp6 RNA polymerase in the presence of [32P]UTP. After RNase digestion, a protected fragment of 110 nucleotides was analyzed with 6% polyacrylamide-urea gel electrophoresis and quantitated using the PhosphorImager SF scanner. The distributions of nucleocytoplasmic RB15 RNA or U6 snRNA were expressed as a percentage of the total amount of RB15 or U6 RNAs in the fraction of cytoplasm plus nucleus.Continuous Labeling or Pulse-Chase Labeling ExperimentHepG2 cells were plated onto six-well plates until 80% confluent. Cells were infected with 2 × 105 pfu of AvRB15 or AvRB15 mutant in serum-free EMEM for 15 h. Control cells were without adenovirus infection. The cells were washed with PBS and methionine-free EMEM (ICN Biomedicals Inc.), followed by incubation with methionine-free EMEM for 30 min. The cells were then labeled with a Tran35S-label (100 μCi/well, ICN, Costa Mesa, CA) in methionine-free EMEM. For the continuous-labeling experiment, the cells were labeled at 37 °C for 0, 10, 30, 45, 60, 120, and 180 min. For pulse-chase experiments, the cells were labeled for 15 min at 37 °C. After pulse labeling, the media were removed, and the cells were incubated with serum-free EMEM containing 2 mm methionine for 0, 10, 30, 45, 60, 120, and 180 min. At each time point, medium was collected, and cells were lysed with 2 ml of buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 9.0, 100 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40) containing a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Both cellular and medium samples were subjected to immunoprecipitation using human apoB monoclonal antibody 1D1 or 4G3 (Lipoproteins and Atherosclerosis Group, University of Ottawa Heart Institute, Ottawa, Canada).Immunoprecipitation of ApoBBriefly, monoclonal antibody 1D1 or 4G3 was incubated with protein A-Sepharose (RepliGen) in binding buffer (1.5 mglycine, 3.0 m NaCl, pH 8.9) for 1 h. The beads were then blocked with 10% nonfat dry milk to reduce nonspecific background binding. Immunoprecipitation was carried out by incubating 1 ml of medium or cell lysate with antibody-protein A complex at 4 °C overnight. Immunocomplex beads were washed twice with wash buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS), once with a 1:1 mixture of wash buffer and 1 m NaCl, and once with wash buffer only. The beads were suspended in a sample buffer containing 8 m urea and 2% SDS. ApoB proteins were resolved on 6% ProSieve 50 gel (FMC, Rockland, ME). The gel was fixed and enhanced with fluorography. The migration bands of apoB100 and truncated apoB were quantitated by using the PhosphorImager SF scanner.Characterization of Secreted Apolipoprotein B-containing LipoproteinsIn some experiments, after the pulse-chase experiment, the media were subjected to sequential ultracentrifugation at densities of 1.006, 1.063, and 1.210 g/ml. The salt density of the media was adjusted by adding appropriate amounts of NaCl/KBr salt solutions. After centrifugation, lipoproteins were collected and dialyzed extensively. Each lipoprotein fraction was immunoprecipitated with the monoclonal antibody 1D1 or 4G3. The method for immunoprecipitation of apoB was the same as described above.RESULTSHammerhead Ribozymes Targeted at Sites Flanking C6666of ApoB mRNAA schematic diagram of the hammerhead ribozyme targeted at GUA6679↓ of apoB mRNA is shown in Fig.1. The conserved catalytic domain (stem II) is flanked by 13 nucleotides complementary to the apoB mRNA targeted at GUA6679↓ (stems I and III). The nucleotide sequences in boldface type are essential nucleotides required for ribozyme cleaving activity. Mutation of these nucleotides will result in partial or complete loss of ribozyme function. The RB15 mutant was constructed by substituting the G5 with an A (G5A). In vitro ribozyme activity was assayed using ribozyme RNAs of RB15, RB16, and RB15 mutant. As shown in Fig.2, apoB RNA of 829 nucleotides was cleaved by ribozyme RB15 to produce two fragments of 656 and 173 nucleotides, whereas cleaving by ribozyme RB16 generated two fragments of 670 and 159 nucleotides. Ribozyme RB15 RNA targeted at sequences GUA6679↓ cleaved 49 ± 6.6% (n = 5) of apoB RNA at"
