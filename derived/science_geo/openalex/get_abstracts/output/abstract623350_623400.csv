Mutation and dysregulation of PcG genes cause developmental defects and cancer. PcG proteins form condensates in the cell nucleus, and these condensates are the physical sites of PcG-targeted gene silencing via formation of facultative heterochromatin. However, the physiochemical principles underlying the formation of PcG condensates remain unknown, and their determination could shed light on how these condensates compact chromatin. Using fluorescence live-cell imaging, we observed that the Polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1) protein chromobox 2 (CBX2), a member of the CBX protein family, undergoes phase separation to form condensates and that the CBX2 condensates exhibit liquid-like properties. Using site-directed mutagenesis, we demonstrated that the conserved residues of CBX2 within the intrinsically disordered region (IDR), which is the region for compaction of chromatin in vitro, promote the condensate formation both in vitro and in vivo. We showed that the CBX2 condensates concentrate DNA and nucleosomes. Using genetic engineering, we report that trimethylation of Lys-27 at histone H3 (H3K27me3), a marker of heterochromatin formation produced by PRC2, had minimal effects on the CBX2 condensate formation. We further demonstrated that the CBX2 condensate formation does not require CBX2–PRC1 subunits; however, the condensate formation of CBX2–PRC1 subunits depends on CBX2, suggesting a mechanism underlying the assembly of CBX2–PRC1 condensates. In summary, our results reveal that PcG condensates assemble through liquid–liquid phase separation (LLPS) and suggest that phase-separated condensates can organize PcG-bound chromatin.

The genome in eukaryotic cells can be broadly classified as euchromatin (active transcription) and heterochromatin (repression and silencing) (1Brown S.W.

These functions and behaviors of facultative heterochromatin have raised several fundamental questions. For example, what are the properties of facultative heterochromatin? How is chromatin compaction achieved? How do PcG proteins contribute to establishing facultative heterochromatin compartments? How do PcG proteins maintain facultative heterochromatin compartments? These questions are essential for understanding how facultative heterochromatin functions and preserves cell identity. trimethylation of Lys-27 at histone H3 chromobox embryonic ectoderm development intrinsically disordered region liquid–liquid phase separation Polycomb group polyhomeotic homolog Polycomb repressive complex ring finger protein 2 mouse embryonic stem HaloTag yellow fluorescent protein fluorescence recovery after photobleaching glutathione S-transferase differential interference contrast AT-hook ATH-like serine-rich region chromodomain Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium fetal bovine serum tetramethylrhodamine. Biochemical and genetic studies of PcG proteins have begun addressing some of the questions raised above. For example, in terms of understanding the properties of facultative heterochromatin, it has been shown that PcG proteins directly regulate chromatin structure and chemically modify the histones of facultative heterochromatin (7Schuettengruber B.

Thus, a feedback loop between PRC1 and PRC2 is created to reinforce the epigenetic modifications of facultative heterochromatin. In terms of understanding compaction, it has been demonstrated that the compaction function of PRC1 in mammals is facilitated by CBX2 of the CBX protein family (20Grau D.J. Chapman B.A. Garlick J.D.

Overall, these biochemical and genetic studies suggest that PRC1 and PRC2 coordinate to establish and maintain facultative heterochromatin. Despite these exciting advances, the fundamental physicochemical principles that underpin how PcG proteins establish, maintain, and regulate facultative heterochromatin remain incompletely understood. Understanding these questions is critical for appreciating how PcG proteins control development and differentiation.

The described dual-modality, dual-view, point-of-care oral cancer screening device, developed for high-risk populations in remote regions with limited infrastructure, implements autofluorescence imaging (AFI) and white light imaging (WLI) on a smartphone platform, enabling early detection of pre-cancerous and cancerous lesions in the oral cavity with the potential to reduce morbidity, mortality, and overall healthcare costs. Using a custom Android application, this device synchronizes external light-emitting diode (LED) illumination and image capture for AFI and WLI. Data is uploaded to a cloud server for diagnosis by a remote specialist through a web app, with the ability to transmit triage instructions back to the device and patient. Finally, with the on-site specialist's diagnosis as the gold-standard, the remote specialist and a convolutional neural network (CNN) were able to classify 170 image pairs into 'suspicious' and 'not suspicious' with sensitivities, specificities, positive predictive values, and negative predictive values ranging from 81.25% to 94.94%."
https://openalex.org/W2902335244,"Pneumonia is one of the major causes of child mortality, yet with a timely diagnosis, it is usually curable with antibiotic therapy. In many developing regions, diagnosing pneumonia remains a challenge, due to shortages of medical resources. Lung ultrasound has proved to be a useful tool to detect lung consolidation as evidence of pneumonia. However, diagnosis of pneumonia by ultrasound has limitations: it is operator-dependent, and it needs to be carried out and interpreted by trained personnel. Pattern recognition and image analysis is a potential tool to enable automatic diagnosis of pneumonia consolidation without requiring an expert analyst. This paper presents a method for automatic classification of pneumonia using ultrasound imaging of the lungs and pattern recognition. The approach presented here is based on the analysis of brightness distribution patterns present in rectangular segments (here called “characteristic vectors“) from the ultrasound digital images. In a first step we identified and eliminated the skin and subcutaneous tissue (fat and muscle) in lung ultrasound frames, and the “characteristic vectors”were analyzed using standard neural networks using artificial intelligence methods. We analyzed 60 lung ultrasound frames corresponding to 21 children under age 5 years (15 children with confirmed pneumonia by clinical examination and X-rays, and 6 children with no pulmonary disease) from a hospital based population in Lima, Peru. Lung ultrasound images were obtained using an Ultrasonix ultrasound device. A total of 1450 positive (pneumonia) and 1605 negative (normal lung) vectors were analyzed with standard neural networks, and used to create an algorithm to differentiate lung infiltrates from healthy lung. A neural network was trained using the algorithm and it was able to correctly identify pneumonia infiltrates, with 90.9% sensitivity and 100% specificity. This approach may be used to develop operator-independent computer algorithms for pneumonia diagnosis using ultrasound in young children."

To unravel the molecular profile associated with the onset and early development of WBD in broiler chickens, we compared time-series gene expression profiles of Pectoralis (P.) major muscles between unaffected and affected birds from a high-breast-muscle-yield, purebred broiler line. P. major biopsy samples were collected from the cranial and caudal aspects of the muscle belly in birds that were raised up to 7 weeks of age (i.e. market age). Three subsets of biopsy samples comprising 6 unaffected (U) and 10 affected (A) from week 2 (cranial) and 4 (caudal), and 4U and 11A from week 3 (cranial) were processed for RNA-sequencing analysis. Sequence reads generated were processed using a suite of bioinformatics programs producing differentially expressed (DE) genes for each dataset at fold-change (A/U or U/A) >1.3 and False Discovery Ratio (FDR) <0.05 (week 2: 41 genes; week 3: 618 genes and week 4: 39 genes). Functional analysis of DE genes using literature mining, BioDBnet and IPA revealed several biological processes and pathways associated with onset and progress of WBD. Top among them were dysregulation of energy metabolism, response to inflammation, vascular disease and remodeling of extracellular matrix. This study reveals that presence of molecular perturbations involving the vasculature, extracellular matrix and metabolism are pertinent to the onset and early pathogenesis of WBD in commercial meat-type chickens."
https://openalex.org/W2902687746,"Lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases (LPMOs) are monocopper enzymes that catalyze oxidative cleavage of glycosidic bonds in polysaccharides in the presence of an external electron donor (reductant). In the classical O2-driven monooxygenase reaction, the reductant is needed in stoichiometric amounts. In a recently discovered, more efficient H2O2-driven reaction, the reductant would be needed only for the initial reduction (priming) of the LPMO to its catalytically active Cu(I) form. However, the influence of the reductant on reducing the LPMO or on H2O2 production in the reaction remains undefined. Here, we conducted a detailed kinetic characterization to investigate how the reductant affects H2O2-driven degradation of 14C-labeled chitin by a bacterial LPMO, SmLPMO10A (formerly CBP21). Sensitive detection of 14C-labeled products and careful experimental set-ups enabled discrimination between the effects of the reductant on LPMO priming and other effects, in particular enzyme-independent production of H2O2 through reactions with O2. When supplied with H2O2, SmLPMO10A catalyzed 18 oxidative cleavages per molecule of ascorbic acid, suggesting a “priming reduction” reaction. The dependence of initial rates of chitin degradation on reductant concentration followed hyperbolic saturation kinetics, and differences between the reductants were manifested in large variations in their half-saturating concentrations (KmRapp). Theoretical analyses revealed that KmRapp decreases with a decreasing rate of polysaccharide-independent LPMO reoxidation (by either O2 or H2O2). We conclude that the efficiency of LPMO priming depends on the relative contributions of reductant reactivity, on the LPMO’s polysaccharide monooxygenase/peroxygenase and reductant oxidase/peroxidase activities, and on reaction conditions, such as O2, H2O2, and polysaccharide concentrations.

https://openalex.org/W2902238608,"Seaweed-associated microbiota experience spatial and temporal shifts in response to changing environmental conditions and seaweed physiology. These shifts may result in structural, functional and behavioral changes in the host with potential consequences for its fitness. They, thus, may help the host to adapt to changing environmental conditions. The current knowledge of seasonal variation of seaweed-associated microbiota is however still limited. In this study, we explored temporal and spatial variation of microbial communities associated with the invasive brown seaweed S. muticum. We sampled in northern and southern Portugal, in September, March and July-August (summer). In addition, as (pseudo-)perennial seaweeds display seasonal reproductive phenology, we sampled various parts of the individuals to disentangle the effect of temporal changes from those due to structural development variations. The diversity and structure of associated microbial communities were determined using next generation sequencing of the variable regions V5-7 of the 16S rDNA. We expected to find differentiation in associated microbial communities between regions and sampling months, but with differences depending on the seaweed structure examined. As expected, the study revealed substantial temporal shifts in S. muticum microbiome, for instance with large abundance of Rhodobacteraceae and Loktanella in September-March but prevalence of Pirellulales during the summer months. Variations between regions and tissues were also observed: in northern Portugal and on basal structures, bacterial diversity was higher as compared to the South and apical parts. All examined seaweed structures showed temporal differences in associated microbial community structure over time, except for holdfasts between September and March. Bacteria contributing to these changes varied spatially. Conversely to all other structures, the holdfast also did not show differences in associated community structure between southern and northern regions. Our study highlights the importance of structural microscale differentiations within seaweeds hosts with regard to their associated microbial communities and their importance across temporal and spatial dimensions."
https://openalex.org/W2902767785,"Nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT) is the rate-limiting enzyme in the NAD+ salvage pathway from nicotinamide. By controlling the biosynthesis of NAD+, NAMPT regulates the activity of NAD+-converting enzymes, such as CD38, poly-ADP-ribose polymerases, and sirtuins (SIRTs). SIRT6 is involved in the regulation of a wide number of metabolic processes. In this study, we investigated the ability of SIRT6 to regulate intracellular NAMPT activity and NAD(P)(H) levels. BxPC-3 cells and MCF-7 cells were engineered to overexpress a catalytically active or a catalytically inactive SIRT6 form or were engineered to silence endogenous SIRT6 expression. In SIRT6-overexpressing cells, NAD(H) levels were up-regulated, as a consequence of NAMPT activation. By immunopurification and incubation with recombinant SIRT6, NAMPT was found to be a direct substrate of SIRT6 deacetylation, with a mechanism that up-regulates NAMPT enzymatic activity. Extracellular NAMPT release was enhanced in SIRT6-silenced cells. Also glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase activity and NADPH levels were increased in SIRT6-overexpressing cells. Accordingly, increased SIRT6 levels reduced cancer cell susceptibility to H2O2-induced oxidative stress and to doxorubicin. Our data demonstrate that SIRT6 affects intracellular NAMPT activity, boosts NAD(P)(H) levels, and protects against oxidative stress. The use of SIRT6 inhibitors, together with agents inducing oxidative stress, may represent a promising treatment strategy in cancer.-Sociali, G., Grozio, A., Caffa, I., Schuster, S., Becherini, P., Damonte, P., Sturla, L., Fresia, C., Passalacqua, M., Mazzola, F., Raffaelli, N., Garten, A., Kiess, W., Cea, M., Nencioni, A., Bruzzone, S.

Such reactions may involve early to late formation of different native structural regions along the reaction pathway. To obtain insights into the transition state for a coupled binding and folding reaction, we performed restrained molecular dynamics simulations using previously determined experimental binding Φb values of the interaction between two IDP domains: the activation domain from the p160 transcriptional co-activator for thyroid hormone and retinoid receptors (ACTR) and the nuclear co-activator binding domain (NCBD) of CREB-binding protein, each forming three well-defined α-helices upon binding. These simulations revealed that both proteins are largely disordered in the transition state for complex formation, except for two helices, one from each domain, that display a native-like structure. The overall transition state structure was extended and largely dynamic with many weakly populated contacts. To test the transition state model, we combined site-directed mutagenesis with kinetic experiments, yielding results consistent with overall diffuse interactions and formation of native intramolecular interactions in the third NCBD helix during the binding reaction. Our findings support the view that the transition state and, by inference, any encounter complex in coupled binding and folding reactions are structurally heterogeneous and largely independent of specific interactions. Furthermore, experimental Φb values and Brønsted plots suggested that the transition state is globally robust with respect to most mutations but can display more native-like features for some highly destabilizing mutations, possibly because of Hammond behavior or ground-state effects.

https://openalex.org/W2902887567,"This study calculates cigarette affordability for 78 countries worldwide from 2001 to 2014 using the Relative Income Price (RIP) ratio defined as the percentage of per capita GDP required to purchase 100 packs of cigarettes using the lowest price from Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU) database, examine the association between cigarette affordability and cigarette consumption, and calculate the affordability elasticity of demand.RIP (2001-2014) was calculated for 16 low-income economies, 19 lower middle-income economies, 13 upper middle-income economies, and 30 high-income economies. Ordinary least square regressions were used to analyze the association between cigarette affordability and consumption.Per capita consumption continued to rise in low-income countries and decreased slightly in lower middle-income countries as the RIP of cigarette consistently declined in low- and lower middle-income economies from 2001 to 2014. The real cigarette prices continued to decline in low- and lower middle-income countries and continued to rise in upper middle- and high-income countries. Though cigarettes were more expensive in HICs than were in LMICs, cigarettes were more affordable in HICs than were in LMICs. The regression results show a 10% increase in the RIP of cigarettes led to a 2% decrease in per capita consumption. The affordability elasticity of demand differed significantly between HICs and LMICs. However, the effect of cigarette affordability on consumption has not changed over time.To control the smoking epidemic, low- and lower middle-income countries should further increase cigarette prices. The rate of price increase should exceed the rate of economic growth and outpace the inflation rate to make cigarettes less affordable and thereby reducing tobacco use."
https://openalex.org/W2902180337,"Anopheles gambiae, An. coluzzii and An. arabiensis are the three major vectors of malaria in Nigeria. These mosquitoes have developed resistance to different insecticides. Insecticides resistance intensity assay was recently introduced to provide insight into the potential operational significance of insecticide resistance. Here, we present data on pyrethroids resistance intensity and resistance mechanisms from six vector surveillance sites (Lagos, Ogun, Edo, Anambra, Kwara and Niger) in Nigeria. Adult Anopheles reared from larval collections were tested using WHO insecticides susceptibility protocol with 1x concentration of permethrin and deltamethrin followed with intensity assays with 5x and 10x concentrations of both insecticides. Synergistic and biochemical assays were carried out and underlying resistance mechanisms determined following standard protocols. Anopheles gambiae constituted >50% samples tested in five sites. Permethrin and deltamethrin resistance was observed at all the sites. The Kdt50 varied from 15 minutes (CI = 13.6-17.2) in deltamethrin to 42.1 minutes (CI = 39.4-44.1) in permethrin. For both insecticides, Kdt95 was >30 minutes with 25% to 87% post exposure mortality at the different sites. The West Africa knock down resistance (kdr-w) mechanism was found at each site. Resistant An. gambiae from Lagos, Ogun and Niger synergized prior to permethrin or deltamethrin exposure showed significant mortality (89-100%) compared to unsynergized mosquitoes (Lagos, p = 0.031; Ogun, p = 0.025; Niger, p = 0.018). Biochemical analyses revealed significant increased levels of P450 enzymes in resistant Anopheles gambiae from Lagos (p = 0.038); Ogun (p = 0.042) and Niger (p = 0.028) in addition to GST in Lagos (p = 0.028) and Ogun (p = 0.033). Overall, the results revealed high pyrethroid resistance associated with increased activities of metabolic enzymes (P450 + GST) in An. gambiae and An. coluzzii from Lagos and Ogun. The presence of kdr + P450 conferred moderate resistance whereas low resistance was the case where kdr was the sole resistance mechanism. Findings thus suggests that elevated levels of cytochrome P450 enzymes together with GST were responsible for high or severe pyrethroid resistance."
https://openalex.org/W2949767963,"Laboratory diagnosis of Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) remains unsettled, despite updated guidelines. We investigated the potential utility of quantitative data from a nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) for C. difficile toxin gene (tg) for patient management.Using data from the largest ever C. difficile diagnostic study (8853 diarrhoeal samples from 7335 patients), we determined the predicative value of C. difficile tgNAAT (Cepheid Xpert C.diff) low cycle threshold (CT) value for patient toxin positive status, CDI severity, mortality and CDI recurrence. Reference methods for CDI diagnosis were cytotoxicity assay (CTA) and cytotoxigenic culture (CTC).Of 1281 tgNAAT positive faecal samples, 713 and 917 were CTA and CTC positive, respectively. The median tgNAAT CT for patients who died was 25.5 vs 27.5 for survivors (p = 0.021); for toxin-positivity was 24.9 vs 31.6 for toxin-negative samples (p<0.001) and for patients with a recurrence episode was 25.6 vs 27.3 for those who did not have a recurrent episode (p = 0.111). Following optimal cut-off determination, low CT was defined as ≤25 and was significantly associated with a toxin-positive result (P<0.001, positive predictive value 83.9%), presence of PCR-ribotype 027 (P = 0.025), and mortality (P = 0.032). Recurrence was not associated with low CT (p 0.111).Low tgNAAT CT could indicate CTA positive patients, have more severe infection, increased risk of mortality and possibly recurrence. Although, the limited specificity of tgNAAT means it cannot be used as a standalone test, it could augment a more timely diagnosis, and optimise management of these at-risk patients."
https://openalex.org/W2902378677,"Background Hypoxia training enhances the endurance capacity of athletes. This response may in part be attributed to the hypoxia-induced increase in antioxidant capacity in skeletal muscles. Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), a key transcription factor which regulates the expression of genes via binding to the antioxidant-response element (ARE) of these genes, plays a crucial role in stimulating the body’s defense system and potentially responds to hypoxia. Meanwhile, hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) is an important player in protecting cells from hypoxic stress. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of acute hypoxia exposure with different durations on the activation of Nrf2-ARE pathway and a possible regulatory role of HIF-1α in these responses. Methods C57BL/6J mice were allocated into the non-hypoxia 0-hour, 6-hour, 24-hour, and 48-hour hypoxic exposure (11.2% oxygen) groups. The quadriceps femoris was collected immediately after hypoxia. Further, to investigate the possible role of HIF-1α, C2C12 myoblasts with HIF-1α knockdown by small interfering RNA (siRNA) and the inducible HIF-1α transgenic mice were employed. Results The results showed that 48-hour hypoxia exposure up-regulated protein expression of Nrf2, Nrf2/ARE binding activity and the transcription of antioxidative genes containing ARE (Sod1 and others) in mouse skeletal muscle. Moreover, HIF-1α siRNA group of C2C12 myoblasts showed a remarkable inhibition of Nrf2 protein expression and nuclear accumulation in hypoxia exposure for 72 hours compared with that in siRNA-Control group of the cells. In addition, HIF-1α transgenic mice gave higher Nrf2 protein expression, Nrf2/ARE binding activity and expressions of Nrf2-mediated antioxidative genes in their skeletal muscle, compared with those in the wild-type mice. Conclusions The findings suggested that the acute hypoxia exposure could trigger the activation of Nrf2-ARE pathway, with longer duration associated with higher responses, and HIF-1α expression might be involved in promoting the Nrf2-mediated antioxidant responses in skeletal muscle."
https://openalex.org/W2903445580,"Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) in humans is a chronic and often fatal disease if left untreated. Dogs appear to be the main reservoir host for L. infantum infection, however, in many regions other canids such as jackals, foxes, wolves and other mammals, such as hares or black rats, have been implicated as wild reservoirs. Most dogs cannot form an effective immune response against this infection, and this could be modulated by small non-coding RNAs, called microRNAs, responsible for post-transcriptional control of gene expression. Here, we evaluated the expression of miRNAs in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of symptomatic dogs naturally infected with Leishmania (L.) infantum (n = 10) and compared to those of healthy dogs (n = 5). Microarray analysis revealed that miR-21, miR-424, miR-194 and miR-451 had a 3-fold increase in expression, miR-192, miR-503, and miR-371 had a 2-fold increase in expression, whereas a 2-fold reduction in expression was observed for miR-150 and miR-574. Real-time PCR validated the differential expression of miR-21, miR-150, miR-451, miR-192, miR-194, and miR-371. Parasite load of PBMC was measured by real-time PCR and correlated to the differentially expressed miRNAs, showing a strong positive correlation with expression of miR-194, a regular positive correlation with miR-371 expression, and a moderate negative correlation with miR-150 expression in PBMC. These findings suggest that Leishmania infection interferes with miRNAs expression in PBMC, and their correlation with parasite load may help in the identification of therapeutic targets in Canine Visceral Leishmaniasis (CVL)."
https://openalex.org/W2903519459,"Visual attractiveness and rarity often results in large carnivores being adopted as flagship species for stimulating conservation awareness. Their hunting behaviour and prey selection can affect the population dynamics of their prey, which in turn affects the population dynamics of these large carnivores. Therefore, our understanding of their trophic ecology and foraging strategies is important for predicting their population dynamics and consequently for developing effective conservation programs. Here we concentrate on an endangered species of carnivores, the snow leopard, in the Himalayas. Most previous studies on snow leopard diet lack information on prey availability and/or did not genetically check, whether the identification of snow leopard scats is correct, as their scats are similar to those of other carnivores. We studied the prey of snow leopard in three Himalayan regions in Nepal (Sagarmatha National Park (SNP), Lower Mustang (LM) and Upper Manang (UM) in the Annapurna Conservation Area, during winter and summer in 2014–2016. We collected 268 scats along 139.3 km linear transects, of which 122 were genetically confirmed to belong to snow leopard. Their diet was identified by comparing hairs in scats with our reference collection of the hairs of potential prey. We determined prey availability using 32–48 camera-traps and 4,567 trap nights. In the SNP, the most frequent prey in snow leopard faeces was the Himalayan tahr in both winter and summer. In LM and UM, its main prey was blue sheep in winter, but yak and goat in summer. In terms of relative biomass consumed, yak was the main prey everywhere in both seasons. Snow leopard preferred large prey and avoided small prey in summer but not in winter, with regional differences. It preferred domestic to wild prey only in winter, and in SNP. Unlike most other studies carried out in the same area, our study uses genetic methods for identifying the source of the scat. Studies solely based on visual identification of samples may be strongly biased. Diet studies based on frequency of occurrence of prey tend to overestimate the importance of small prey, which may be consumed more often, but contribute less energy than large prey. However, even assessments based on prey biomass are unlikely to be accurate as we do not know whether the actual size of the prey consumed corresponds to the average size used to calculate the biomass eaten. For example, large adults may be too difficult to catch and therefore mostly young animals are consumed, whose weight is much lower. We show that snow leopard consumes a diverse range of prey, which varies both regionally and seasonally. We conclude that in order to conserve snow leopards it is also necessary to conserve its main wild species of prey, which will reduce the incidence of losses of livestock."

To avert irreversible complications in congenital disorders producing early pathogenesis, safety and efficacy of AAV-intrauterine gene transfer (IUGT) requires assessment We therefore performed IUGT of AAV5 or -8 with liver-specific promoter-1 encoding either human coagulation factors IX (hPIX) or × (hFX) into Macaca fascicularis fetuses at ∼0.4 gestation. The initial cohort received 1 × 1012 vector genomes (vgs) of AAV5-hFIX (n = 5; 0.45 × 1013 vg/kg birth weight), resulting in ∼3.0% hPIX at birth and 0.6–6.8% over 19–51 mo. The next cohort received 0.2-1 × 1013 vg boluses. AAV5-hPX animals (n = 3; 3.57 × 1013 vg/kg) expressed <1% at birth and 9.4–27.9% up to 42 mo. AAV8-hFIX recipients (n = 3; 2.56 × 1013 vg/kg) established 4.2–41.3% expression perinatally and 9.8–25.3% over 46 mo. Expression with AAV8-hFX (n = 6,3.12 × 1013 vg/kg) increased from <1% perinatally to 9.8–13.4% >35 mo. Low expressers (<1%, n = 3) were postnatally challenged with 2 × 1011 vg/kg AAV5 resulting in 2.4–13.2% expression and demonstrating acquired tolerance. Linear amplification-mediated-PCR analysis demonstrated random integration of 57–88% of AAV sequences retrieved from hepatocytes with no events occurring in or near oncogenesis-associated genes. Thus, early-IUGT in macaques produces sustained curative expression related significantly to integrated AAV in the absence of clinical toxicity, supporting its therapeutic potential for early-onset monogenic disorders.—Chan, J.

https://openalex.org/W2903399731,"Methyl benzoate (MB) is a plant-derived volatile organic compound with insecticidal properties, but such activity has not been evaluated against the sweetpotato whitefly Bemisia tabaci (Gennadius) (Hemiptera: Aleyrodidae), a major crop pest. In this study, we tested methyl benzoate control efficacy on B. tabaci infecting tomato plants in a greenhouse, specifically measuring contact and fumigant toxicity, as well as repellent activity. For direct spray applications of 0% (control), 0.1%, 0.25%, 0.5%, 1%, 2% MB onto tomato leaves infested with adults of B. tabaci (< 5-d-old), 2% MB showed the highest corrected mortality (100%) at 24 h post-treatment. For residual toxicity in which the same MB solutions were sprayed onto tomato leaves and allowed to dry for 2 h before < 5-d-old adults were released, the 2% MB also showed the highest corrected mortality (100%) at 48 h post-treatment. The lethal median concentration (LC50) for eggs, fourth-instar nymphs, and adults were 0.3%, 0.2%, and 0.2%, respectively. In pot culture experiments, 1% MB concentration was found more effective at killing nymphs and preventing adult eclosion than all other concentrations, and gave 100 percent population reduction compared with the control. MB repelled adult whiteflies and caused 96.5% fumigant toxicity within 10 h post-treatment. Repellency and anti-oviposition rates against B. tabaci had median effective doses of 0.24% and 0.16%, respectively. Our results suggest that MB has strong potential as an environmentally friendly biopesticide for control of B. tabaci but field trials and further greenhouse studies are required to establish efficacy under more natural conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2902684055,"Toxoplasma gondii is a ubiquitous, obligate intracellular eukaryotic parasite that causes congenital birth defects, disease in immunocompromised individuals, and blindness. Protein glycosylation plays an important role in the infectivity and evasion of immune responses of many eukaryotic parasites and is also of great relevance to vaccine design. Here we demonstrate that micronemal protein 2 (MIC2), a motility-associated adhesin of T. gondii, has highly glycosylated thrombospondin repeat (TSR) domains. Using affinity-purified MIC2 and MS/MS analysis along with enzymatic digestion assays, we observed that at least seven C-linked and three O-linked glycosylation sites exist within MIC2, with >95% occupancy at these O-glycosylation sites. We found that addition of O-glycans to MIC2 is mediated by a protein O-fucosyltransferase 2 homolog (TgPOFUT2) encoded by the TGGT1_273550 gene. Even though POFUT2 homologs are important for stabilizing motility-associated adhesins and for host infection in other apicomplexan parasites, loss of TgPOFUT2 in T. gondii had only a modest impact on MIC2 levels and the wider parasite proteome. Consistent with this, both plaque formation and tachyzoite invasion were broadly similar in the presence or absence of TgPOFUT2. These findings indicate that TgPOFUT2 O-glycosylates MIC2 and that this glycan, in contrast to previous findings in another study, is dispensable in T. gondii tachyzoites and for T. gondii infectivity."
https://openalex.org/W2902802514,"Do people with higher life satisfaction have more children? Having children requires considerable energy and investment on the part of parents. However, even in countries where contraceptives are easily available and widely used, where having children is optional and most of time the result of an intended action, parenthood has not gone ""out of fashion"". This paper tests the hypothesis that higher life satisfaction fosters reproductive behavior. We argue that people satisfied with their overall life feel better prepared to start the monumental task of childrearing. If, it is suggested, life satisfaction facilitates fertility, then this positive link should be observable in contemporary low fertility societies. The hypothesis is tested by taking overall life satisfaction as a determinant of fertility behavior using long longitudinal data available for developed countries: namely for Australia, Germany, Russia, South Korea, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and the United States. We find that higher levels of subjective well-being are, indeed, associated with a higher probability of having children in all the countries considered. We, therefore, conclude that life satisfaction favors reproduction, at least in low fertility societies."
https://openalex.org/W2903530751,"It is well known that cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are a major contributor of death in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) as well in other rheumatic illness. In the last decades, there has been a growing development of different methodologies with the purpose of early detection of CVD. Objective: The aim of this study is to correlate the usefulness of subclinical parameters of vascular aging and QRISK 3–2017 score for early detection of CVD in SLE. Methods: Clinical assessment including systemic lupus erythematosus disease activity index (SLEDAI) and systemic lupus international collaborating clinics / american college of rheumatology damage index (SLICC/ACR DI), laboratory measurements, carotid ultrasound examination, carotid intima media thickness (cIMT) measurement, carotid distention and diameter analysis, arterial stiffness measurement measured by tonometry and QRISK 3–2017 were done. All results were analyzed by SPSS 24 software. Results: We observed correlation between QRISK3 and mean cIMT (rs = 0.534, P < 0.001), PWV (rs = 0.474, P < 0.001), cfPWV (rs = 0.569, P < 0.001) and distensibility (rs = -0.420, P = 0.006). Consistent with above, SLE patients in middle and high risk QRISK 3–2017 showed increased arterial stiffness versus low risk group. Conclusions: We encourage to the rheumatology community to assess cardiovascular risk in SLE patients with QRISK 3–2017 risk calculator as an alternative method at the outpatient clinic along a complete cardiovascular evaluation when appropriate."
https://openalex.org/W2902055669,"We aimed to investigate individual differences that associate with peoples' acute risk perception for activities such as walking and giving birth, including objective risk and the mapping of numerical magnitudes. The Amazon Mechanical Turk platform was used, with 284 participants recruited (40% female) ranging between 19 and 68 years. Participants had to indicate the positions of (1) the relative death risk of activities on a horizontal-line with 'very low risk of death' and 'very high risk of death' as left and right anchors respectively and (2), numerical magnitudes on a horizontal-line ranging 0-1000. The MicroMort framework was used to index acute risk of death (one/million chance of dying from an accident). Previous experience with the activities, handedness, along with risk propensity and unrealistic optimism were also measured. Linear mixed-effects modelling was used to investigate predictors of subjective MicroMort judgments. Individuals subjectively judged activities to be riskier if the activity was objectively riskier, if they over-estimated on the numerical task (more so for low-risk activities as compared to high-risk), or if they had not experienced the activity previously. The observed relationship between the number line task and everyday risk judgments is in keeping with the idea of a common magnitude representation system. In conclusion, individuals are able to discriminate between activities varying in risk in an absolute sense, however intuition for judging the relative differences in risk is poor. The relationship between the misjudging of both risks and numerical magnitudes warrants further investigation, as may inform the development of risk communication strategies."
https://openalex.org/W2952944936,"Objectives We hypothesized that systemic administration of high-mobility group box 1 fragment attenuates the progression of myocardial fibrosis and cardiac dysfunction in a hamster model of dilated cardiomyopathy by recruiting bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells thus causing enhancement of a self-regeneration system. Methods Twenty-week-old J2N-k hamsters, which are δ-sarcoglycan-deficient, were treated with systemic injection of high-mobility group box 1 fragment (HMGB1, n = 15) or phosphate buffered saline (control, n = 11). Echocardiography for left ventricular function, cardiac histology, and molecular biology were analyzed. The life-prolonging effect was assessed separately using the HMGB1 and control groups, in addition to a monthly HMGB1 group which received monthly systemic injections of high-mobility group box 1 fragment, 3 times (HMGB1, n = 11, control, n = 9, monthly HMGB1, n = 9). Results The HMGB1 group showed improved left ventricular ejection fraction, reduced myocardial fibrosis, and increased capillary density. The number of platelet-derived growth factor receptor-alpha and CD106 positive mesenchymal stem cells detected in the myocardium was significantly increased, and intra-myocardial expression of tumor necrosis factor α stimulating gene 6, hepatic growth factor, and vascular endothelial growth factor were significantly upregulated after high-mobility group box 1 fragment administration. Improved survival was observed in the monthly HMGB1 group compared with the control group. Conclusions Systemic high-mobility group box 1 fragment administration attenuates the progression of left ventricular remodeling in a hamster model of dilated cardiomyopathy by enhanced homing of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells into damaged myocardium, suggesting that high-mobility group box 1 fragment could be a new treatment for dilated cardiomyopathy."
https://openalex.org/W2902103932,"The purpose of this study was to assess the diagnostic performance of 3T MRI after intratympanic injection of gadodiamide for delayed endolymphatic hydrops (DEH), and assess the relationship between endolymphatic hydrops (ELH) and vestibular function in patients diagnosed with DEH and confirmed by 3T MRI. Nineteen patients clinically diagnosed with DEH (11 ipsilateral DEH, 8 contralateral DEH) participated in this study. Diluted gadodiamide was administered to the bilateral tympanic cavity by injection through the tympanic membrane. At 24 hours post-injection, the ELH was evaluated by MRI. Patient vestibular functions were evaluated by caloric testing and cVEMP. ELH was observed in all patients (19/19: positive rate 100%). The distribution patterns of ELH varied between the cochlear or vestibular region. Vestibular ELH was observed in the affected ear in all ipsilateral DEH patients. In the contralateral DEH patients, however, there were individual differences in the distribution patterns of ELH. Six patients (1 ipsilateral DEH, 5 contralateral DEH) had bilateral ELH. No obvious relationships were observed between ELH and vestibular function. ELH distribution was complicated, particularly in the contralateral DEH cases. It was difficult to identify the existence of ELH by vestibular functional testing alone; therefore, 3T MRI is thought to be useful for identifying the affected ear. A significant number of cases had “bilateral” DEH, particularly among the contralateral DEH cases, indicating that we should pay careful attention to this pathology when treating DEH."

Inflammatory indicators such as the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), the platelet-lymphocyte ratio (PLR), carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA 19-9), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and C-reactive protein (CRP) were analyzed for establishing nomograms predicting overall survival (OS). Concordance index (C-index) determined predictive accuracy and discriminative ability.Our study selected 807 ACRC patients, 29.6% RSCC and 70.4% LSCRC. Median OS was 23.36 months. Patients at lower level of NLR, PLR, CEA, CA 19-9, LDH and CRP showed longer OS (P < 0.001). For all patients, pathological grade (P = 0.018), treatments (P = 0.042), sidedness (P = 0.003), NLR (P < 0.001), CA 19-9 (P < 0.001), LDH (P < 0.001) and CRP (P = 0.0012) contributed to OS independently. For RSCC, pathological grade (P = 0.022), CA 19-9 (P < 0.001), LDH (P < 0.001) and CRP (P = 0.001) were significantly related with OS. For LSCRC patients, treatments (cetuximab vs chemotherapy: P = 0.008; bevacizumab vs chemotherapy: P = 0.166), NLR (P < 0.001), CA 19-9 (P = 0.030) and LDH (P < 0.001) were independent factors for OS. Final models showed acceptable internal validity with C-indexes of 0.687, 0.697 and 0.667 in all, RSCC and LSCRC patients.Inflammatory factors enrolled in the proposed nomograms showed accurately individualized prognostic prediction, and prognostic factors for RSCC and LSCRC were different."

https://openalex.org/W2903049633,"Foreign accents have been shown to have considerable impact on how language is processed [1]. However, the impact of a foreign accent on semantic processing is not well understood. Conflicting results have been reported by previous event-related potential (ERP) studies investigating the impact of foreign-accentedness on the N400 effect elicited by semantic violations. Furthermore, these studies have only examined a subset of the four characteristics of the N400 (i.e. onset latency, latency, amplitude, and scalp distribution), and have been conducted in linguistic environments where foreign-accented speech is relatively uncommon. The current study therefore compared the N400 effect elicited by semantic violations in native Australian English vs. Mandarin-accented English, in a context where foreign-accented speech is common. Factors which may be responsible for individual variability in N400 amplitude were also investigated. The results showed no differences between the N400s elicited by native and foreign-accented speech in any of the four aforementioned characteristics. However, the analysis of individual variability revealed an effect of familiarity with foreign-accented speech on the amplitude of N400 effects for semantic violations. An effect of working memory capacity on N400 amplitude was also found. These findings highlight the relevance of the ambient linguistic environment for studies of speech processing, and demonstrate the interacting influences of both speaker- and listener-related factors on semantic processing."
https://openalex.org/W2902042811,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is leading cause of cancer-related mortality and is categorized among the most common malignancies around the world. It is a heterogeneous tumor, which shows significant degree of histopathological heterogeneity. Despite the apparent histopathological diversity there has been very little distinct correlation between histopathological features and molecular aberrations particularly when it comes to the expression level of Wnt and Hh pathway molecules. The role of Wnt and Hh pathways in relation to HCC behavior viz. histopathological heterogeneity and aggressiveness is not known. Determining the sequential molecular changes and associated histopathological characteristic during HCC initiation, promotion, and progression would probably lead to a better treatment and prognosis.N-Nitrosodiethylamine (DEN) induced HCC model in male Wistar rats were established to study the expression level of Wnt and Hh pathway molecules during different stages of hepatocarcinogenesis. Their expression levels were checked at mRNA and protein levels at initiation, promotion, and progression stages of HCC. The expression levels of Wnt and Hh pathway molecules were correlated with biospecimens of HCC patients of different stages.In the present study we identified the comprehensive change in the expression pattern of Wnt and Hh pathway molecules in DEN induced rodent hepatocarcinogenesis model. Our results demonstrate that β-catenin /CTNNB1 plays important role in tumor initiation and promotion by stimulating tumor cell proliferation. The activated Wnt signaling in early stage of HCC is associated with well-differentiated histological pattern. The Hh activity although activated during the initiation stage but is significantly increased during the early promotion stage of hepatocarcinogenesis. The increased activity of both Wnt & Hh pathways during promotion stage is associated with moderately-differentiated histological pattern and was simultaneously linked with an increased expression of MMP9. Furthermore, our data demonstrated that during the progression stage Wnt pathway is modestly down-regulated but the Hh pathway activity sustained which in turn is associated with aggressive and invasive phenotype and poorly-differentiated histopathology.Our data uncovers the grade related expression of Wnt and Hh pathway molecules and the potential utility of these molecular signatures in daily clinical practice is to decide best therapy according to patients characteristic. Additionally, our data offer insight into the interaction between Wnt and Hh pathways which triggers HCC development and progression."

Optimized multiplex PCR assays were tested on 247 well-characterised carriage isolates from six countries of the African meningitis belt. The PCR algorithm developed enabled the detection of N. meningitidis species using gel-based and real-time multiplex PCR targeting porA, sodC, cnl and characterization of capsule genes through sequential multiplex PCR assays for genogroups (A, W, X, then B, C, Y and finally H, E and Z). Targeting both porA and sodC genes together allowed the detection of meningococci with a sensitivity of 96% and 89% and a specificity of 78% and 67%, for qPCR and gel-based PCR respectively. The sensitivity and specificity ranges for capsular genogrouping of N. meningitidis are 67% - 100% and 98%-100% respectively for gel-based PCR and 90%-100% and 99%-100% for qPCR.

In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, bulk synthesis of PC occurs primarily via the PE methylation pathway and the CDP-choline (Kennedy) pathway (Fig. 1). In the absence of exogenous choline, the CDP-choline pathway does not contribute to net PC synthesis but is important for recycling choline derived from turnover pathways.

Based on in vitro experiments with yeast extracts, another route for GPC conversion, namely its acylation to LPC, was described (16Stålberg K. Neal A.C. Ronne H. Ståhl U.

Overall, the degradation of PC to form GPC, followed by its stepwise reacylation to PC, defines a novel PC deacylation/reacylation remodeling pathway (PC-DRP) for PC biosynthesis (12Patton-Vogt J.

PC, like other phospholipids, consists of multiple molecular species based on acyl chain differences at the sn-1 and sn-2 position of the glycerol backbone. The repertoire of fatty acids in yeast is relatively simple as compared with the higher eukaryotes, consisting primarily of C16 and C18 fatty acids with either one or no double bond (20Wagner S. Paltauf F. Generation of glycerophospholipid molecular species in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae: fatty acid pattern of phospholipid classes and selective acyl turnover at sn-1 and sn-2 positions.Yeast. 1994; 10 (7871882): 1429-143710.1002/yea.320101106Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Thus, the four major PC species observed through MS have the following acyl chain combinations: 32:1PC (monounsaturated) consists of C16:0 and C16:1, 32:2PC (diunsaturated) consists of C16:1 and C16:1, 34:2PC (diunsaturated) consists of C16:1 and C18:1, and 34:1PC (monounsaturated) consists of either C16:0 and C18:1 (this being the predominant acyl chain combination) or C16:1 and C18:0 (21Renne M.F.

The steady-state PC molecular species profile is the result of the molecular specificity of the PC biosynthetic routes combined with post synthetic acyl chain exchange (21Renne M.F. Bao X. De Smet C.H. de Kroon A.I. Lipid acyl chain remodeling in yeast.Lipid Insights. 2015; 8 (26819558): 33-40PubMed Google Scholar). The PE methylation pathway produces predominantly diunsaturated PC species, whereas the CDP-choline pathway produces a more mixed profile (21Renne M.F. Bao X. De Smet C.H. de Kroon A.I. Lipid acyl chain remodeling in yeast.Lipid Insights. 2015; 8 (26819558): 33-40PubMed Google Scholar, 24Boumann H.A. Damen M.J. Versluis C. Heck A.J. de Kruijff B. de Kroon A.I.

Furthermore, a number of studies have provided evidence for the postsynthetic remodeling of PC species (20Wagner S. Paltauf F. Generation of glycerophospholipid molecular species in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae: fatty acid pattern of phospholipid classes and selective acyl turnover at sn-1 and sn-2 positions.Yeast. 1994; 10 (7871882): 1429-143710.1002/yea.320101106Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 25Tanaka K.

Indeed, PC remodeling was clearly demonstrated by pulse-chase studies using deuterium-labeled (methyl-D3)-methionine followed by electrospray ionization–MS/MS analysis. Those studies revealed a postsynthetic increase in monounsaturated PC species (32:1 and 34:1) at an expense of diunsaturated PC species (32:2 and 34:2) (24Boumann H.A. Damen M.J. Versluis C. Heck A.J. de Kruijff B. de Kroon A.I. The two biosynthetic routes leading to phosphatidylcholine in yeast produce different sets of molecular species: evidence for lipid remodeling.Biochemistry. 2003; 42 (12627972): 3054-305910.1021/bi026801rCrossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Prior to this work, an acyltransferase responsible for remodeling PC to more saturated species in S. cerevisiae had not been identified. Here we undertook a more thorough examination of PC remodeling via PC-DRP and the role of the GPC acyltransferase, Gpc1. Importantly, we report that Gpc1 is a key player in postsynthetic PC remodeling events that result in more saturated PC species. In addition, we find that Gpc1 is regulated with respect to other aspects of lipid metabolism and that loss of Gpc1 impacts stationary phase viability. Cellular GPC has two potential metabolic fates. The glycerophosphodiesterase encoded by GDE1 can hydrolyze GPC to produce glycerol-3-phosphate and choline (14Fisher E. Almaguer C. Holic R. Griac P. Patton-Vogt J. Glycerophosphocholine-dependent growth requires Gde1p (YPL110c) and Git1p in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.J. Biol.

Additionally, GPC can be acylated (likely at the sn-1 position) to LPC by Gpc1, a recently described acyltransferase (17Glab B. Beganovic M. Anaokar S. Hao M.S. Rasmusson A.G. Patton-Vogt J. Banaś A.

LPC can be converted to PC by Ale1, consistent with its role as a lysophospholipid acyltransferase (18Riekhof W.R. Wu J. Gijón M.A. Zarini S. Murphy R.C. Voelker D.R.

To gain further insight into the relative flux of GPC toward hydrolysis versus acylation, in vivo metabolic labeling was employed in strains lacking GPC1 and/or GDE1 (Fig. 2). Cells were grown in the presence of [14C]GPC, which enters through the Git1 transporter (27Almaguer C. Fisher E. Patton-Vogt J. Posttranscriptional regulation of Git1p, the glycerophosphoinositol/glycerophosphocholine transporter of Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Curr.

GIT1, a gene encoding a novel transporter for glycerophosphoinositol in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Genetics. 1998; 149 (9691030): 1707-1715Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and label incorporation in the lipid fraction was determined. The [14C]LPC intermediate in the acylation of [14C]GPC to [14C]PC is virtually undetectable under the uniform labeling conditions employed in Fig. 2A; therefore only the label in PC is quantified. As shown in Fig. 2A, a gpc1Δ mutant incorporates roughly 35% less label into PC as compared with WT, consistent with its role as a GPC acyltransferase. A gde1Δ mutant incorporates 50% less label into PC, indicating that a large portion of the label incorporated into PC in a WT strain under low phosphate conditions originates from free [14C]choline released through the action of Gde1. A gde1Δ gpc1Δ double mutant incorporates even less label, confirming the importance of both metabolic routes in determining the ultimate fate of GPC. The label remaining in the gde1Δ gpc1Δ double mutant is likely the result of an uncharacterized acyltransferase and/or glycerophosphodiesterase that can act on GPC. To demonstrate that Gpc1 produces LPC in vivo and thereby confirm its cellular role, we designed an alternative labeling scheme and employed an ale1Δ mutant to block the second acylation step (Fig. 2B). In the experiment represented in Fig. 2A, cells were grown under low-phosphate conditions to induce the expression of GIT1 (28Almaguer C. Mantella D. Perez E. Patton-Vogt J. Inositol and phosphate regulate GIT1 transcription and glycerophosphoinositol incorporation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Eukaryot.

Here, a plasmid harboring GIT1 under the control of the constitutive ADH1 promoter (31Wykoff D.D. O'Shea E.K. Phosphate transport and sensing in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Genetics. 2001; 159 (11779791): 1491-1499Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was employed to allow cell growth under normal phosphate level, a condition that represses the expression of GDE1 and therefore reduces the hydrolysis of GPC once it enters the cell (14Fisher E. Almaguer C. Holic R. Griac P. Patton-Vogt J. Glycerophosphocholine-dependent growth requires Gde1p (YPL110c) and Git1p in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.J. Biol.

In addition, the labeling time in the presence of [14C]GPC was reduced to roughly two generations. Under these conditions, a 3-fold increase in labeled LPC was detected in an ale1Δ mutant as compared with WT, and that increase was counteracted by simultaneous deletion of GPC1 (see the ale1Δ gpc1Δ double mutant). At the same time, labeled PC levels decreased in an ale1Δ mutant and decreased further in an ale1Δ gpc1Δ double mutant. The fact that PC levels were reduced by only 50% in the ale1Δ strain suggests that other enzymes may exist that are capable of converting LPC to PC in the cell. However, an additional possibility is that the increased LPC being produced is hydrolyzed, ultimately releasing free choline that could be incorporated into PC via the Kennedy pathway. These results confirm the formation of the immediate product of Gpc1 activity, LPC, in vivo, and the role of Ale1 in converting LPC into PC. A potential function for the PC-DRP is to modify the acyl chain content. To determine whether Gpc1 activity affects the PC molecular species profile, LC-MS/MS was performed (parent ion scanning for m/z 184). The cells were not supplemented with exogenous GPC for these experiments, so the substrate for Gpc1 activity presumably arose through endogenous phospholipase B activity (19Dowd S.R. Bier M.E. Patton-Vogt J.L. Turnover of phosphatidylcholine in Saccharomyces cerevisiae: the role of the CDP-choline pathway.J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276 (11078727): 3756-376310.1074/jbc.M003694200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Fig. 3A includes the range of PC species produced by yeast. Focusing on the major species, the data indicate that the loss of Gpc1 results in a decrease in monounsaturated PC species (32:1, 34:1) and an increase in diunsaturated PC species (32:2, 34:2) as proportions of the total PC pool. Overexpression, as predicted, has the opposite effect (Fig. 3B). When GPC1 was placed under the control of the GAL1 promoter and cells were grown on galactose, there was an increase in monounsaturated PC species (32:1 and 34:1) and a decrease in diunsaturated PC species (32:2, 34:2). In total, these results indicate that Gpc1 impacts the PC species profile and suggest that Gpc1 activity favors the utilization of saturated acyl-CoA species when acylating GPC. Because Ale1 converts LPC to PC as part of the PC-DRP, we analyzed its impact on the PC molecular species profile. If Ale1 were the only LPC acyltransferase in the cell, and assuming that Ale1 does not affect the species profiles of the lipid precursors of PC (PE and diacylglycerol), the profile of the ale1Δ mutant should resemble that of the gpc1Δ mutant, because the reacylation pathway would stall at LPC, and the LPC produced would likely be rapidly hydrolyzed by phospholipases. In fact, the ale1Δ mutant did not resemble the gpc1Δ strain in terms of PC species, because a slight decrease in PC32:2 and an increase in PC34:2 were its only significant changes from WT. The ale1Δ gpc1Δ mutant, like gpc1Δ, exhibited an increase in diunsaturated species and a decrease in monounsaturated species as compared with WT, although the magnitude of the changes was not identical between the two strains (Fig. 4). These results suggest that there may be more acyltransferases capable of acylating LPC in the cell (32Jasieniecka-Gazarkiewicz K. Demski K. Lager I. Stymne S. Banaś A.

The steady-state PC molecular species profile in a cell represents a combination of PC biosynthesis, PC degradation, and PC acyl chain remodeling. In the experiments presented in Fig. 3, cells were grown in the absence of free choline, so the PE methylation pathway, not the Kennedy pathway, was primarily responsible for PC biosynthesis. However, flux through the Kennedy pathway can also occur as a result of free choline released through phospholipase-mediated turnover. To examine the extent to which PC turnover resulting in free choline release followed by resynthesis contributes to the observed PC species profile, we utilized a pct1Δ mutant in which flux through the Kennedy pathway is blocked. As shown in Fig. 4, the PC species profile in pct1Δ was largely unchanged from WT, in agreement with Ref. 22De Smet C.H. Cox R. Brouwers J.F. de Kroon A.I.

That increase may be the result of the observed uptick in GPC1 transcript upon PCT1 deletion (see Fig. 6), as evidenced by the fact that 32:1 again decreases in a pct1Δ gpc1Δ double mutant. Overall, these results indicate that the PC species profiles generated under our experimental conditions are primarily the result of PC synthesis via the PE methylation pathway followed by PC remodeling via PC-DRP. We reported previously that Gpc1 had limited ability to utilize acyl-CoAs to acylate glycerophosphoethanolamine in an in vitro system (17Glab B. Beganovic M. Anaokar S. Hao M.S. Rasmusson A.G.

To probe the possibility that Gpc1 acylates glycerophosphoethanolamine to affect PE in vivo, we analyzed the PE molecular species. As shown in Fig. 5A, we did not detect any significant difference in PE molecular species profile when comparing a WT strain to a gpc1Δ strain. Hence, Gpc1 does not play a major role, if at all, in PE remodeling in vivo under the conditions employed here. The effect of GPC1 deletion on the phosphatidylinositol (PI) and phosphatidylserine (PS) species profiles was also examined. As shown in Fig. 5 (B and C), no significant differences between WT and gpc1Δ were found. In addition, the overall fatty acid composition of all cellular lipids was determined by GC. As shown in Fig. 5D, WT and gpc1Δ fatty acid compositions are largely the same, with the exception of a small but significant decrease in C16:0 in gpc1Δ. This change is consistent with the fact that the gpc1Δ mutant displays a decrease in monounsaturated PC species and may reflect the loss of"

This study determined the frequency of scan artefacts and errors in GCIPL imaging in individuals undergoing HD-OCT surveillance for glaucoma.A total of 1439 eyes from 721 subjects enrolled in a prospective study assessing predictors of glaucoma progression underwent macular GCIPL imaging with the CIRRUS HD-OCT at recruitment. The prevalence of acquisition errors, segmentation errors, and co-morbid macular pathology was determined.A total of 87 (6.0%) of the 1439 scans had either acquisition errors, segmentation artefacts, or other macular pathology. The most common co-morbid macular pathology was epiretinal membrane in 2.2% of eyes.The macular GCIPL scan was artefact free in 94% of eyes. However, epiretinal membrane and high myopia can cause scan artefact and should be considered when interpreting the results."
https://openalex.org/W2902938025,"The telomerase enzyme enables unlimited proliferation of most human cancer cells by elongating telomeres and preventing replicative senescence. Despite the critical importance of telomerase in cancer biology, challenges detecting telomerase activity and expression in individual cells have hindered the ability to study patterns of telomerase expression and function across heterogeneous cell populations. While sensitive assays to ascertain telomerase expression and function exist, these approaches have proven difficult to implement at the single cell level. Here, we validate in situ RNAscope detection of the telomerase TERT mRNA and couple this assay with our recently described TSQ1 method for in situ detection of telomere elongation. This approach enables detection of TERT expression, telomere length, and telomere elongation within individual cells of the population. Using this assay, we show that the heterogeneous telomere elongation observed across a HeLa cell population is in part driven by variable expression of the TERT gene. Furthermore, we show that the absence of detectable telomere elongation in some TERT-positive cells is the result of inhibition by the telomeric shelterin complex. This combined assay provides a new approach for understanding the integrated expression, function, and regulation of telomerase at the single cell level."
https://openalex.org/W2902256291,"The Multidisciplinary Approach to the Study of Chronic Pelvic Pain (MAPP) Research Network has yielded neuroimaging and urinary biomarker findings that highlight unique alterations in brain structure and in urinary proteins related to tissue remodeling and vascular structure in patients with Urological Chronic Pelvic Pain Syndrome (UCPPS). We hypothesized that localized changes in diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) measurements might be associated with corresponding changes in urinary protein levels in UCPPS. To test this hypothesis, we created statistical parameter maps depicting the linear correlation between DTI measurements (fractional anisotropy (FA) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC)) and urinary protein quantification (MMP2, MMP9, NGAL, MMP9/NGAL complex, and VEGF) in 30 UCPPS patients from the MAPP Research Network, after accounting for clinical covariates. Results identified a brainstem region that showed a strong correlation between both ADC (R2 = 0.49, P<0.0001) and FA (R2 = 0.39, P = 0.0002) with urinary MMP9 levels as well as a correlation between both ADC (R2 = 0.42, P = 0.0001) and FA (R2 = 0.29, P = 0.0020) and urinary MMP9/NGAL complex. Results also identified significant correlations between FA and urinary MMP9 in white matter adjacent to sensorimotor regions (R2 = 0.30, P = 0.002; R2 = 0.36, P = 0.0005, respectively), as well as a correlation in similar sensorimotor regions when examining ADC and urinary MMP2 levels (R2 = 0.42, P<0.0001) as well as FA and urinary MMP9/NGAL complex (R2 = 0.33, P = 0.0008). A large, diffuse cluster of white matter was identified as having a strong correlation between both ADC (R2 = 0.35, P = 0.0006) and FA (R2 = 0.43, P<0.0001) with urinary NGAL levels. In contrast, no significant association between DTI measurements and VEGF was observed. Results suggest that elevated MMP9 or MMP9/NGAL in UCPPS may be related to degenerative neuronal changes in brainstem nuclei through excitotoxicity, while also facilitating synaptic plasticity in sensorimotor regions."

Previous studies have not evaluated the geographic variation of this relationship across the United States. Analyses were based on three groupings of age-adjusted completed suicide rates (all suicide, firearm-related suicide, non-firearm-related suicide) from 2286 counties in the United States. Multiple regression was used to determine the overall relationship between atmospheric pressure and completed suicide rates. Geographically weighted regression (GWR) models were used to obtain local coefficient estimates. A negative correlation between atmospheric pressure and completed suicide rates was observed for all three suicide groupings (p-value <0.0001). Significant, negative GWR coefficient estimates were located in the West and Northeast for the all suicides and firearm-related suicides, and in the Midwest for non-firearm-related suicides."
https://openalex.org/W2902154442,"Background Overweight and obesity among young people is alarmingly high. While hundreds of millions of children participate in organised sports worldwide, it is currently unknown whether time spent in organised sports is associated with levels of adiposity among young people. This study aimed to investigate bidirectional associations between participation in organised sports and adiposity over a two year period. Method Data were drawn from the Longitudinal Study of Australian Children. In total, 4033 participants (51% male) reported time spent in organised sports and had their body mass index, body fat percentage, and waist circumference measured at age 12, and again two years later. A cross-lagged panel model was used to examine bidirectional relationships over time, as well as interaction effects. Results Total sport participation at age 12 was not associated with subsequent BMI-z scores (β = 0.01 [95% CI, -0.02, 0.04]), body fat (β = 0.01 [95% CI, -0.02, 0.03]), or waist circumference (β = -0.01 [95% CI, -0.05, 0.02]). Similarly, measure of adiposity at age 12 were not associated with subsequent sports participation (BMI-z score: β = -0.01 [95% CI, -0.02, 0.04]; body fat percentage: β = -0.02 [95% CI, -0.05, 0.02]; waist circumference: β = -0.01 [95% CI, -0.01, 0.03]). There were no differences in the strength or direction of the relationships by type of sport or by sex (p < .05). Conclusion Policy and programmatic changes may be needed before organised youth sports are considered a preventative strategy for overweight and obesity. However, a more nuanced understanding of why organised youth sports are not associated with adiposity is needed before evidence-based changes can be made."
https://openalex.org/W2902253852,"Intestinal villus atrophy is a major complication of total parenteral nutrition (TPN). Our previous study revealed that TPN-induced villus atrophy is accompanied by elevated expression of CUGBP, Elav-like family member 1 (CELF1); however, its mechanism of action has not been fully understood. Herein, we report a pivotal role of CELF1/p53 axis, which induces a sustained antiproliferative signal, leading to suppressed proliferation of intestinal epithelial cells (IECs). By using a rat model of TPN, we found synchronous upregulation of CELF1 and p53 in jejunum mucosa, accompanied by a 51% decrease in crypt cell proliferation rate. By using HCT-116 cells as an IEC model in vitro, we found that the expression of CELF1 altered dynamically in parallel to proliferation rate, suggesting a self-adaptive expression pattern in IECs in vitro. Furthermore, ectopic overexpression of CELF1 elicited a significant antiproliferative effect in HCT-116, Caco-2, and IEC-6 cells, whereas knockdown of CELF1 elicited a significant proproliferative effect. Moreover, cell-cycle assay revealed that ectopic overexpression of CELF1 induced sustained G2 arrest and G1 arrest in HCT-116 and IEC-6 cells, respectively, which could be abolished by p53 silencing. Mechanistically, polysomal profiling and nascent protein analysis revealed that regulation of p53 by CELF1 was mediated through accelerating its protein translation in polysomes. Taken together, our findings revealed a sustained suppression of IEC proliferation evoked by CELF1/p53 axis, which may be a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of TPN-induced villus atrophy.-Yan, J.-K., Zhang, T., Dai, L.-N., Gu, B.-L., Zhu, J., Yan, W.-H., Cai, W., Wang, Y.

https://openalex.org/W2903023494,"The serine-rich repeat (SRR) glycoproteins of Gram-positive bacteria are large, cell wall–anchored adhesins that mediate binding to many host cells and proteins and are associated with bacterial virulence. SRR glycoproteins are exported to the cell surface by the accessory Sec (aSec) system comprising SecA2, SecY2, and 3–5 additional proteins (Asp1 to Asp5) that are required for substrate export. These adhesins typically have a 90-amino acid-long signal peptide containing an elongated N-region and a hydrophobic core. Previous studies of GspB (the SRR adhesin of Streptococcus gordonii) have shown that a glycine-rich motif in its hydrophobic core is essential for selective, aSec-mediated transport. However, the role of this extended N-region in transport is poorly understood. Here, using protein–lipid co-flotation assays and site-directed mutagenesis, we report that the N-region of the GspB signal peptide interacts with anionic lipids through electrostatic forces and that this interaction is necessary for GspB preprotein trafficking to lipid membranes. Moreover, we observed that protein–lipid binding is required for engagement of GspB with SecA2 and for aSec-mediated transport. We further found that SecA2 and Asp1 to Asp3 also localize selectively to liposomes that contain anionic lipids. These findings suggest that the GspB signal peptide electrostatically binds anionic lipids at the cell membrane, where it encounters SecA2. After SecA2 engagement with the signal peptide, Asp1 to Asp3 promote SecA2 engagement with the mature domain, which activates GspB translocation."
https://openalex.org/W2903202814,"Modeling spatially explicit data provides a powerful approach to identify the effects of exogenous features associated with biological processes, including recruitment of stream fishes. However, the complex spatial and temporal dynamics of the stream and the species' reproductive and early life stage behaviors present challenges to drawing valid inference using traditional regression models. In these settings it is often difficult to ensure the spatial independence among model residuals-a key assumption that must be met to ensure valid inference. We present statistical models capable of capturing complex residual anisotropic patterns through the addition of spatial random effects within an inferential framework that acknowledges uncertainty in the data and parameters. Proposed models are used to explore the impact of environmental variables on Lake sturgeon (Acipenser fulvescens) reproduction, particularly questions about patterns in egg deposition. Our results demonstrate the need to apply valid statistical methods to identify relationships between response variables, e.g., egg counts, across locations, and environmental covariates in the presence of strong and anisotropic autocorrelation in stream systems. The models may be applied to other settings where gamete distribution or, more generally, other biotic phenomena may be associated with spatially dynamic and anisotropic processes."
https://openalex.org/W2902721260,"Objective Previous studies show that multiparity and a number of chronic conditions are correlated among women. Also, low respiratory muscle strength has been associated to adverse health outcomes such as chronic lung disease and early mortality. This study aimed to investigate associations between the number of lifetime pregnancies and maximal inspiratory/expiratory pressures. Methods In a cross-sectional study, 204 women ages 41–80 years-old, from the rural community of Santa Cruz, Brazil, provided data regarding demographics, socioeconomic characteristics, health behaviors, and number of lifetime pregnancies (≤3, 4–6 or ≥7). Maximal respiratory pressures were measured with a digital manometer. Multiple linear regression analysis was used to examine the association of multiple childbearing on maximal respiratory pressures. Results Of the participants, 44.1% had ≤3 pregnancies, 30.4% had 4–6 pregnancies and 25.5% had >7 pregnancies. In the unadjusted analyses, maximal inspiratory and expiratory pressures varied significantly according to multiple childbearing categories. After adjustment, the values remained statistically significant only for maximal expiratory pressure. Compared to women with ≤3 lifetime pregnancies, those who had ≥7 pregnancies had significantly lower maximal expiratory pressure values (β = -18.07, p = 0.01) Conclusion Multiple childbearing appears to be negatively associated with maximal respiratory pressures; women with a higher number of lifetime pregnancies had lower values of maximal respiratory pressures when compared to those with fewer pregnancies. This association may be due to biomechanical changes in the respiratory muscles promoted by multiple lifetime pregnancies. This finding indicates a need to motivate women, from the prenatal to postpartum period, to safely exercise their respiratory muscles, including abdominal muscle exercises as well as respiratory muscle training."
https://openalex.org/W2902802169,"Identification of hotspot drug-receptor interactions through in-silico prediction methods (Pharmacophore mapping, virtual screening, 3DQSAR, etc), is considered as a key approach in drug designing and development process. In the current design study, advanced in-silico based computational techniques were used for the identification of lead-like molecules against the targeted receptor β-glucuronidase. The binding pattern of a potent inhibitor in the ligand-receptor X-ray co-crystallize complex was used to identify and extract the structure-base Pharmacophore features. Based on these observations; five structure-based pharmacophore models were derived to conduct the virtual screening of ICCBS in-house data-base. Top-ranked identified Hits (33 compounds) were selected to subject for in-vitro biological activity evaluation against β-glucuronidase enzyme; out of them, twenty compounds (61% of screened compounds) evaluated as actives, however eleven compounds were found to have significantly higher inhibitory activity, including compounds 1, 5-8, 10, 12-13, and 17-19 with IC50 values ranging from 1.2 μM to 34.9 μM. Out of the eleven potent inhibitors, seven compounds 1, 5, 6, 7, 8, 13, and 19 were found new, and evaluated first time for the β-glucuronidase inhibitory activity. Compounds 1, 5 and 19 exhibited a highly potent inhibition in uM of β-glucuronidase enzyme with non-cytotoxic behavior against the mouse fibroblast (3T3) cell line. Our combined in-silico and in-vitro results revealed that the binding pattern analysis of the eleven potent inhibitors, showed almost similar non-covalent interactions, as observed in case of our validated pharmacophore model. The obtained results thus demonstrated that the virtual screening minimizes false positives, and provide a template for the identification and development of new and more potent β-glucuronidase inhibitors with non-toxic effects."
https://openalex.org/W2903055197,"Monitoring small groups of sheep in spontaneous evolution in the field, we decipher behavioural rules that sheep follow at the individual scale in order to sustain collective motion. Individuals alternate grazing mode at null speed and moving mode at walking speed, so cohesive motion stems from synchronising when they decide to switch between the two modes. We propose a model for the individual decision making process, based on switching rates between stopped / walking states that depend on behind / ahead locations and states of the others. We parametrize this model from data. Next, we translate this (microscopic) individual-based model into its density-flow (macroscopic) equations counterpart. Numerical solving these equations display a traveling pulse propagating at constant speed even though each individual is at any moment either stopped or walking. Considering the minimal model embedded in these equations, we derive analytically the steady shape of the pulse (sech square). The parameters of the pulse (shape and speed) are expressed as functions of individual parameters. This pulse emerges from the non linear coupling of start/stop individual decisions which compensate exactly for diffusion and promotes a steady ratio of walking / stopped individuals, which in turn determines the traveling speed of the pulse. The system seems to converge to this pulse from any initial condition, and to recover the pulse after perturbation. This gives a high robustness to this coordination mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W2903090454,"Radio frequency identification (RFID) has recently experienced unprecedented development. Among many other areas, it has been widely applied in blood station management, automatic supermarket checkout, and logistics. In the application of RFID for large-scale passive tags, tag collision is inevitable owing to the non-cooperation mechanism among tags. Therefore, a tag anti-collision method is a key factor affecting the identification efficiency. In this paper, we propose a tag anti-collision method based on Aloha technology for RFID. It estimates the number of remaining tags using the secant iteration method. To achieve optimal identification efficiency, it adaptively and dynamically adjusts the lengths of the subsequent frames according to the principle that the length of a frame should be the same as the number of tags to be identified. For pseudo-solutions of tag population estimation while using secant iteration, we present an elimination method by two probing frames. The simulation results show that the estimation precision of our method can reach above 97%. Thus, it can meet the requirement of the tag anti-collision estimation accuracy. Its global throughput is obviously superior to the Q algorithm adopted by the current international standard, and it is close to the ideal system. It consequently outperforms existing schemes."

Eukaryotes use a highly conserved set of drug efflux transporters that confer pleiotropic drug resistance (PDR). To interrogate the regulation of this critical process, here we developed a small molecule–responsive biosensor that couples transcriptional induction of PDR genes to growth rate in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Using diverse PDR inducers and the homozygous diploid deletion collection, we applied this biosensor system to genome-wide screens for potential PDR regulators. In addition to recapitulating the activity of previously known factors, these screens identified a series of genes involved in a variety of cellular processes with significant but previously uncharacterized roles in the modulation of yeast PDR. Genes identified as down-regulators of the PDR included those encoding the MAD family of proteins involved in the mitotic spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) complex. Of note, we demonstrated that genetic disruptions of the mitotic spindle assembly checkpoint elevate expression of PDR-mediating efflux pumps in response to exposure to a variety of compounds that themselves have no known influence on the cell cycle. These results not only establish our biosensor system as a viable tool for investigating PDR in a high-throughput fashion, but also uncover critical control mechanisms governing the PDR response and a previously uncharacterized link between PDR and cell cycle regulation in yeast."

To investigate the mechanisms of the early neovascularization induced by MSCs, we analyzed the kinematic features of the motion of ECs and concluded that the dynamic interaction between cells and the extracellular matrix would reveal the capillary-like structure formation. Based on this hypothesis, we proposed a mathematical model to simulate the vascular-like migration pattern of ECs in silico, which was confirmed by in vitro studies. These in vitro studies validated that the dynamic secretion and degradation of collagen I is the critical factor for capillary structure formation. The model proposed based on cell tracking, single cell sequencing, and mathematical simulation provides a better understanding of the neovascularization process induced by MSCs and a possible simple explanation guiding this important cellular behavior.-Yu, Y., Situ, Q., Jia, W., Li, J., Wu, Q., Lei, J.

Methods Pulmonary HRCT images were reconstructed from whole-spine computed tomography (CT) images of 67 patients with SAPHO syndrome. HRCT images of 58 healthy controls were also obtained and reviewed. Patients with pneumonia and tuberculosis were excluded. Demographic and clinical data such as gender, age, onset age, disease duration, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), highly sensitive C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) and the Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI) were collected from the SAPHO syndrome patients. Demographic characteristics, ESR and hs-CRP data from the healthy controls were also recorded. Student’s t test, Mann-Whitney U test, chi-squared test and logistic regression were employed to compare the HRCT findings of the two groups of patients. Results The median age of the SAPHO syndrome patients was 47.0 years, interquartile range [38.0–53.0]; that of the healthy controls was 37.0[30.8–53.8]. From the detailed HRCT evaluations, abnormalities were identified in 45 patients. We found irregular linear opacities in 29 (43.3%) patients, opacities in 22 (32.8%), ground-glass opacity in 11 (16.4%), pleural thickening in 9 (13.4%), solitary nodules in 6 (9%), bronchiectasis in 3 (4.5%), pulmonary bulla in 2 (3%), multiple nodules in 1 (1.5%), and reticular patterns in 1 (1.5%). Compared to the healthy controls, the SAPHO syndrome patients had a significantly higher rate of opacities but a significantly lower percentage of nodules (especially multiple nodules), although the overall rates of abnormal HRCT findings were similar in the two groups. According to the multivariate logistic regression analysis, increased age and BASDAI < 4 were significant predictors of abnormal HRCT findings. Conclusion Our study is the first to address HRCT pulmonary abnormalities in SAPHO syndrome patients. SAPHO syndrome patients have a significantly higher percentage of opacities and a significantly lower rate of pulmonary nodules than healthy controls. BASDAI and age are possible good predictors of abnormal HRCT pulmonary findings."

Neopterin derived from 7,8-dihydroneopterin triphosphate is secreted by monocytes/macrophages, and is a well-known biomarker for cellular immunity. Because PTS activity in the cell can be a determinant of neopterin production, here we used recombinant human PTS protein to investigate how its activity is regulated, especially depending on redox conditions. Human PTS has two cysteines: Cys-43 at the catalytic site and Cys-10 at the N terminus. PTS can be oxidized and consequently inactivated by H2O2 treatment, oxidized GSH, or S-nitrosoglutathione, and determining the oxidized modifications of PTS induced by each oxidant by MALDI–TOF MS, we show that PTS is S-glutathionylated in the presence of GSH and H2O2. S-Glutathionylation at Cys-43 protected PTS from H2O2-induced irreversible sulfinylation and sulfonylation. We also found that PTS expressed in HeLa and THP-1 cells is reversibly modified under oxidative stress conditions. Our findings suggest that PTS activity and S-glutathionylation is regulated by the cellular redox environment and that reversible S-glutathionylation protects PTS against oxidative stress."
https://openalex.org/W2902944711,"In the present study, we carried out an examination of the amino acid usage in the zebra finch (Taeniopygia guttata) proteome. We found that tRNA abundance, base composition, hydrophobicity and aromaticity, protein second structure, cysteine residue (Cys) content and protein molecular weight had significant impact on the amino acid usage of the zebra finch. The above factors explained the total variability of 22.85%, 25.37%, 10.91%, 5.06%, 4.21%, and 3.14%, respectively. Altogether, approximately 70% of the total variability in zebra finch could be explained by such factors. Comparison of the amino acid usage between zebra finch, chicken (Gallus gallus) and human (Homo sapiens) suggested that the average frequency of various amino acid usage is generally consistent among them. Correspondence analysis indicated that base composition was the primary factor affecting the amino acid usage in zebra finch. This trend was different from chicken, but similar to human. Other factors affecting the amino acid usage in zebra finch, such as isochore structure, protein second structure, Cys frequency and protein molecular weight also showed the similar trends with human. We do not know whether the similar amino acid usage trend between human and zebra finch is related to the distinctive neural and behavioral traits, but it is worth studying in depth."
https://openalex.org/W2903083446,"Traumatic insemination (TI) is an extraordinary style of mating behavior wherein the female integument is pierced by the male extragenital structure to transfer the spermatozoa into the female’s body through wounding. Flower bugs of the genus Orius belong to the family Anthocoridae (Heteroptera), which is referred to as the “TI family”. Males possess sharp shaped extragenitalia, and females receive the extragenitalia using the copulatory tubes, which are specialized extragenital structures in Orius species. Since TI is not well studied in insects possessing the copulatory tube, we examined the genital structures and copulatory processes of three species, Orius strigicollis, O. sauteri, and O. minutus. Scanning electron microscopic observations revealed the positions of male extragenital structures during copulation. A needle-like flagellum was deeply inserted into the female intersegment between the abdominal VII and VIII segments, while the curved part of a sickle-like cone forced the intersegment to expand. No scars were detected around the copulation region after copulation. The copulatory tube adhered to the interior of segment VII, and the interior integument around the copulatory tube remained intact after copulation. On the basis of these results, TI does not occur in these Orius species. A pair of seminal conceptacles, which exists in typical TI insects, was found at the base of the oviducts in O. strigicollis. The distal end of the copulatory tube connected to a closed bag with a double-membrane, termed the sperm pouch. The sperm pouch was filled with filamentous structures after copulation and structures with equivalent forms were observed in adult male testis. These structures, considered to be spermatozoa, persisted in the pouch for at least two weeks after copulation, suggesting that the pouch is a long-term spermatozoa storage organ."

Patients' sense of responsibility to healthcare providers was measured with four questions assessing patients' perceptions regarding their responsibilities to respect doctors, respect nurses, coordinate with health professionals, and comply with hospital rules. Predictors included patient sociodemographic characteristics and their past hospitalization experience.Small proportions of respondents reported that they perceived having no responsibility to respect doctors (8.9%), respect nurses (7.9%), comply with hospital rules (6.7%), or coordinate with health professionals (6.3%). Multivariate regression analyses showed that the strongest predictor of patients' sense of responsibility to healthcare providers was patinets' trust in health professionals, followed by patients' education level. Familiarity with healthcare professionals and past hospitalization frequency were inversely associated with patients' sense of responsibility to healthcare providers.Although only a small proportion of the patients reported feeling no or low sense of responsibility to healthcare providers, the lack of respect and collaboration from these patients can negatively affect patient-provider relationships. Healthcare administrators need to communicate clearly with the patients and the public about the role of patients and the limitations of medicine in order to instill a sense of patients' responsibility."
https://openalex.org/W2903118694,"The prevalence of infections is supposed to be higher in older patients and to extend the length of hospital stays. This study aimed, first, to test this supposition within a large psychiatric population which we divided into four clusters of psychiatric ICD-10 diagnoses: F00-F03 (dementias), F10 (substance disorders), F20-29 (schizophrenia, schizophreniform and other non-mood psychotic disorders), F32-F33 (major depressive disorders). Second, despite the increasing evidence for the role of infections in psychiatric disorders, it is, to the best of our knowledge, largely unknown whether the rates of infections with pathogens of the four most frequent germ families differ between psychiatric diseases. Thus, in a retrospective study, the results of clinical routine examinations (pap smear, analysis of midstream urine, stool) dependent on symptoms in 8545 patients of a German psychiatric clinic were analyzed in a 12-year dataset. Results show that a longer hospital stay was associated with an increased number of microbiological tests, but led to no significant difference between positive vs. negative findings. Consistent with previous studies, patients with infections were older than patients without infections. For the F10 diagnosis cluster we found a significantly reduced (F10: Staphylococcaceae) and for the F20-29 cluster a heightened risk of infections (Staphylococcaceae, Corynebacteriaceae). Furthermore, patients belonging to the F00-F03 cluster exhibited elevated rates of infections with all four germ families. The latter can be ascribed to patients’ age as we found higher age to be associated with these infections, independently of the presence of dementia. Our results suggest that different psychiatric diagnoses are associated with a heightened or lowered risk of bacterial infections and, furthermore, that clinical routine infection-screenings for elderly psychiatric patients seems to be reasonable."
