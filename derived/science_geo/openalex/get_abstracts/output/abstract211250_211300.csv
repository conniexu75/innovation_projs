In the experiments described here, Owren's thrombotest (slightly modified, Fig. 1) is used for the assessment of the extent of depression. Each plasma sample is tested in a series of dilutions (D) and the coagulation time (t, mean of 4 readings) measured in a coagulometer3,4. All plasmas and plasma dilutions are kept in carefully siliconized glassware or plastic material. When t is plotted against D, a straight line is obtained (Fig. 1)."

https://openalex.org/W2040593875,"THERE is general agreement that 5-hydroxytryptamino (5HT) is formed from 5-hydroxytryptophan (5HTP) in the presence of 5-hydroxytryptophan decarboxylase (5HTPD). It is then oxidized to 5-hydroxy indolylacetic acid (5HIAH) with monoamine oxidase (MAO). A decrease of brain 5HT has been reported in new-born animals1,2 and those made phenylketonurie by means of a diet high in phenylalanine content3,4. In this communication investigations of the differing mechanisms responsible for this decrease are described."

https://openalex.org/W2002435739,"A study was made to determine the sensitivity of the mammalian nervous system to nonvisual stimulation with ionizing radiation. Blinded rats were exposed, while asleep, to a 1-sec burst of x rays and measurements of behavioral arousal and heart rate were made to indicate activation of the central nervous system. The stimulus was immediately effective since reaction latencies of 1 sec or less were frequently recorded. The relative incidence of arousal and of a heart rate reaction, was found to be related to the radiation dose rate over the range of from 0.05 to 3.2 r/sec. The threshold dose rate was less than 0.05 r/ sec. To test for regional distribution of sensitivity, additional blinded animals were exposed to a burst of x rays at the dose rate of 1.0 r/sec with exposure limited to the head region or to the rest of the body. In that arousal was elicited with exposure of either region it is evident that sensitivity to x- ray stimulation is widely distributed. Since exposure of the head produced a greater incidence and duration of disturbance, differential sensitivity between regions corresponds more closely to the density of ganglionic tissue than to the total tissue volume exposed.more » The results of the study are consistent with the postulation that ganglionic tissue is directly sensitive to ionizing radiation.

https://openalex.org/W2046065352,THE oral administration of acetylsalicylic acid or the intra-muscular injections of sodium salicylate were found by me1 to have no influence on the pituitary-adrenal axis of chickens. High levels of acetylsalicylic acid (0.58 per cent) depressed body-weight while low levels (0.07 and 0.15 per cent) did not influence body-weight or pro-thrombin time. A later report by Hutchins et al.2 confirmed that sodium salicylate did not influence the pituitary-adrenal axis in chickens. These workers also reported that immature chicks acclimatized to 105° F and fed sodium salicylate had lower body-temperatures than controls not fed sodium salicylate. The purpose of this investigation was to determine the influence of acetylsalicylic acid on the body-temperature of heat-stressed birds.

https://openalex.org/W1999023515,"IT is well established that β-sitosterol lowers serum cholesterol-levels in animals and humans1–3. In addition it has been found that in fowls4 β-sitosterol feeding reduces cholesterol- and lipid-levels in the livers and aortas as well as in the serum, at the same time reducing the incidence of atherosclerosis. In a previous experiment5 doubt was cast on the hypothesis3 that β-sitosterol lowers serum cholesterol-levels by inhibiting intestinal absorption of cholesterol. We now report new evidence which further elucidates the nature of the action of β-sitosterol on cholesterol- and lipid-levels."
