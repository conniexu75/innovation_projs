https://openalex.org/W2062695695,"Spatial (left or right) preferences were determined for rats given foot shock in a T-maze. The animals were killed, and left and right striata were assayed separately for dopamine and left and right teldiencephalic regions were assayed for norepinephrine. Dopamine content was significantly higher (by 12 percent) in the striata contralateral to rats' side preferences than in the ipsilateral striata; there was no such difference for teldiencephalic norepinephrine. The small asymmetry in striatal dopamine content is not due to any learning- or stress-related change induced by the testing procedure but is probably inherent in normal rats. Some spatial behavior appears to be the manifestation of a normal and specific difference in the activity of left and right nigrostriatal systems."

https://openalex.org/W1573572714,"Abstract The known binding of a derivative of the COOH-terminal tetrapeptide of gastrin with high biological activity to bovine serum albumin suggests a convenient model system for testing the affinity labeling of hormone binding sites. Photolysis of 4-azidobenzoylpentagastrin, 2-nitro-5-azidobenzoylpentagastrin, 4-acetylbenzoylpentagastrin, and 4-benzoylbenzoylpentagastrin in the presence of bovine serum albumin attaches each peptide derivative covalently to the protein to the extent of 50 mole % using a 3-fold excess of peptide and moderate photolysis times. Under similar conditions using lysozyme for the protein, only 8 mole % peptide is bound. Oleic acid was found to compete for the binding sites on serum albumin. When serum albumin labeled with 4-azidobenzoylpentagastrin was split with cyanogen bromide most of the label was found on two of the peptides located in the middle of the albumin chain. A degree of specificity is thus indicated. These results suggest that the peptide derivatives should be capable of labeling their binding sites on tissue which is stimulated by the hormones gastrin and pancreozymin. In addition, the model photoreactions of acetophenone and benzophenone with glycine were investigated and the photoaddition products isolated. The results of these model reactions and the successful labeling of albumin with ketone derivatives of pentagastrin suggest that ketones may be useful photoaffinity probes."
https://openalex.org/W1483137332,"Abstract Oxyleghemoglobin, added to well stirred suspensions of bacteroids isolated from soybean root nodules, enhances the rates of oxygen consumption and of reduction of acetylene to ethylene, a measure of the activity of the enzyme complex, nitrogenase. The rate of incorporation of labeled nitrogen from 15N2 into NH3, another measure of nitrogenase activity, is also augmented. Ferric leghemoglobin, as well as ferric horseradish peroxidase and ferric cytochrome c peroxidase, were ineffective. Superoxide dismutase and catalase did not significantly affect the rates of oxygen uptake or acetylene reduction. Each of 12 oxygen-binding proteins (including two non-heme proteins) tested augmented both oxygen up-take and acetylene reduction by bacteroid suspensions; the magnitude of the increments was different for different proteins. We deduce that oxyleghemoglobin and other oxygenbinding proteins exert their effects by facilitating the diffusion of oxygen through a thin layer of solution, the unstirred layer, surrounding the bacteroids. In the absence of oxyleghemoglobin, suspensions of bacteroids maintain a substantial oxygen uptake, which is largely ineffective in supporting nitrogenase activity. The addition of oxyleghemoglobin brings about an increment of oxygen consumption (the oxygen uptake) and promotes nitrogenase activity, which increases roughly 10-fold. The ratio of the increment in oxygen consumption to the increment of acetylene reduction is about 2, corresponding to a calculated P:O ratio for bacteroid oxidative phosphorylation of 1:3. A convenient explanation of our results is that in the absence of leghemoglobin, the ineffective oxygen uptake maintains a very low oxygen pressure at the bacteroid surface. In the presence of leghemoglobin we suggest that the operation of leghemoglobin-facilitated oxygen diffusion increases the po2 at the bacteroid surface. This results in the effective oxygen uptake which supports nitrogenase activity. The possible mode of operation of this control system is discussed."

https://openalex.org/W2006135603,"Labeling by ferritin-conjugated agglutinins from Ricinus communis was used to demonstrate the relative mobilities of the agglutinin receptors located in specific regions on plasma membranes of rabbit spermatozoa. The relative mobility of lectin receptors was higher on postacrosomal regions of sperm than on acrosomal and tail regions. Lectin-induced clustering could not be demonstrated in the acrosomal and tail regions, an indication of the existence of localized restraints on the mobilities of lectin receptors. A system of transmembrane restraints may maintain the segregation of plasma membrane components into membrane domains on certain highly differentiated cells."
https://openalex.org/W2037981435,"The present study indicates that extracellular acidosis protects Ehrlich ascites tumor cells and rat kidney cortex cells against injury from anoxia. Parameters measured included cell potassium, adenosine 5'-triphosphate, and uptake of vital dyes. Cells survived longer at a pH of 5.6 to 6.5 than at a pH of 7.4; pH 7.9 was most detrimental. These findings indicate that production of protons by anoxic cells may be a protective feedback mechanism."

https://openalex.org/W1502137459,"HeLa cell DNA-dependent DNA polymerase I, a low molecular weight enzyme of 40,000 to 50,000, has been compared to DNA-dependent DNA polymerase II, a high molecular weight enzyme. Inhibiting antiserum prepared against cytoplasmic DNA polymerase II does not inhibit DNA polymerase I. DNA polymerase II, whether isolated from the nucleus or cytoplasm, shows the same inhibition pattern by antiserum. A DNA polymerase II, obtained from cultured Chinese hamster cells, is also partially inhibited by the HeLa DNA polymerase II antiserum. HeLa DNA polymerase II sediments as one band of approximately 6.5 S (122,000 daltons) in 0.125 m (NH4)2SO4. At a lower salt concentration (0.01 m ), larger aggregates of 10.3 S and 11.7 S are seen. At neither salt concentration is there any DNA polymerase activity sedimenting in the 3 to 4 S region where DNA polymerase I is found."

https://openalex.org/W1575056372,"Abstract Specific polysomes involved in albumin synthesis were identified by the binding of 125I-labeled albumin antibody to rat liver polysomes. The binding is highly specific, and occurs through an immunological recognition of the nascent peptide chains on individual ribosome monomers. The distribution of bound 125I-anti-albumin in the liver polysome profile is in accordance with the expected size of albumin-synthesizing polysomes. Anti-albumin does not bind to polysomes from non-liver tissues, and antibodies against a non-liver protein do not bind to liver polysomes. The antibody binding reaction can be used to estimate the relative size and amount of albumin-synthesizing polysomes in the liver in different physiological conditions."

https://openalex.org/W1530723539,"Glutamate dehydrogenase decreases the distribution coefficient of glutamate oxalacetate transaminase in Sephadex G-200. This is consistent with previous results which suggested that a complex is formed between these two enzymes. These gel filtration as well as kinetic experiments suggest that transaminase can react with monomeric but not polymer forms of glutamate dehydrogenase. When the levels of both mitochondrial enzymes are too low to form a complex, there is little TPNH and NH4+ generated by the combined aspartate aminotransferase and glutamate dehydrogenase reactions. This is because oxalacetate is a potent product inhibitor of transaminase, the reaction with glutamate and glutamate dehydrogenase is slow and α-ketoglutarate, oxalacetate, and aspartate all inhibit this latter reactions. When the levels of both enzymes are sufficiently high to form a complex, asparate can be dehydrogenated quite rapidly even in the absence of α-ketoglutarate. Furthermore, the aspartate dehydrogenase reaction catalyzed by the enzyme-enzyme complex is not markedly inhibited by oxalacetate, or activated by α-ketoglutarate, and can take place even in the presence of rather high levels of glutamate. Kinetic and gel filtration experiments suggest that the dissociation constant of the enzyme-enzyme complex is considerably lower than that of these substrates for the free enzymes. These results suggest that an important physiological function of the enzyme-enzyme complex is to catalyze the asparatate dehydrogenase reaction in organs as brain, liver, and kidney, where the mitochondrial levels of these enzymes are sufficiently high to form a complex. An advantage of catalysis by the complex over transamination with aspartate followed by dehydrogenation of glutamate is that the complex is not markedly inhibited by low levels of oxalacetate. When tyrosine is the substrate and the levels of these two enzymes are too low to form a significant amount of complex, the tyrosine aminotransferase and glutamate dehydrogenase reactions are coupled. This can occur with tyrosine but not aspartate because hydroxyphenylpyruvate is not a potent inhibitor. However, when the levels of both enzymes are sufficiently high to form a significant amount of the enzymeenzyme complex, the tyrosine dehydrogenase reaction can be catalyzed by this complex and again α-ketoglutarate has no effect on the reaction. Similar relationships occur when phenylalanine is the substrate. Thus, the enzyme-enzyme complex can facilitate dehydrogenation of these amino acids which do not react with glutamate dehydrogenase."

https://openalex.org/W1503106450,"Abstract The association constant for the binding of gadolinium ion (Gd3+) to lysozyme has been determined at pH 5.2 by measurements of proton release and at pH 6.5 by ultraviolet difference spectroscopy. The magnitude of the proton release, the shape of the ultraviolet difference spectrum, and the pH dependence of the association constants support the finding from x-ray crystallography that Gd3+ binds to the carboxylate groups of Glu 35 and Asp 52, at the junction of sites D and E in the cleft of the enzyme. The association constants for the binding of several inhibitors and substrates to lysozyme and the Gd3+-lysozyme complex have been obtained by fluorescence spectroscopy. At pH 6.5, the lactone derived from tetra-N-acetylchitotetraose, which we have proposed to be a transition-state analog, has an affinity for lysozyme that is at least 70 times greater than its affinity for the Gd3+-lysozyme complex. This result is evidence that the lactone occupies sites A-B-C-D in the free enzyme. In contrast, the aldonic acid derived from tetra-N-acetylchitotetraose binds to the Gd3+-lysozyme complex 23 times more tightly than it binds to lysozyme itself, probably because of an interaction between the carboxylate group and the metal ion. The values of the association constants at pH 5.2 and 25° for the binding of tri-, tetra-, penta-, and hexasaccharides of N-acetylglucosamine to lysozyme are 1.50, 2.25, 2.20, and 2.81 x 105 m-1, respectively, whereas the values of the constants for binding to the Gd3+-lysozyme complex are 0.75, 0.96, 0.80, and 1.09 x 105 m-1, respectively. The values of these association constants at pH 6.5 are about 30% smaller for binding to lysozyme and about 20% larger for binding to the Gd3+-lysozyme complex. These data are interpreted in terms of the hypotheses that at low concentrations of oligosaccharide, the number of significant modes of binding to lysozyme is one for the trisaccharide, two for the tetra- and pentasaccharides, and probably three for the hexasaccharide; that one of the significant modes for the tetra-, penta-, and hexasaccharides is the same as that for the trisaccharide; and that bound Gd3+ interferes with the binding of the tetra-, penta-, and hexasaccharides in the other mode(s)."
https://openalex.org/W1534381928,"Abstract Homogeneous guanine deaminase (guanine aminohydrolase, EC 3.5.4.3) is a single polypeptide chain of mean molecular weight of 55,000, as determined by Sephadex gel filtration and sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide disc gel electrophoresis. Irreversible inactivation was observed upon incubation with p-chloromercuribenzoate, at a concentration of 1.0 x 10-4 m. Iodoacetic acid and iodoacetamide were mildly inhibitory at a concentration of 2.0 x 10-3 m. The purine precursor 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide was a potent competitive inhibitor of the enzyme, with a Ki of 3.05 x 10-5 m. Its ribonucleoside derivative (5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleoside) and tetrahydrofolic acid were also observed to be competitive inhibitors of the enzyme. Their respective Ki values were 2.58 x 10-4 m for tetrahydrofolic acid and 5.68 x 10-4 m for 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleoside. A single pH optimum at pH 6.8 was observed in Tris, citrate, and phosphate buffers. The Km values determined for substrates of the enzyme, in 0.2 m phosphate buffer at 40°, were 1.25 x 10-5 m for guanine at pH 7.0, 3.33 x 10-4 m for 8-azaguanine at pH 6.0, and 8.0 x 10-4 m for 6-thioguanine at pH 7.0. At saturating substrate concentration, deuterium isotope was observed to enhance the catalytic rate of the enzyme with a Kd2o/Kh2o of 1.58. Deuterium isotope effect on proton transfer was observed at nonsaturating substrate concentration, and a Kh2o/Kd2o of 1.46 was observed at 20% D2O. The enzyme was labile to heat, and a 42% loss of enzyme activity was sustained upon incubation at 55° for 25 min. Irreversible and almost total denaturation was observed upon incubation at 60° for 25 min. The activation energy was linear between 20° and 50°, and an activation energy of 4.94 Cal per mole was calculated for the enzyme. The experimental evidence strongly implicated histidine and cysteine —SH as the catalytic species at the active site of the enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1599300439,"Abstract The 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase, one of the component enzymes of the 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase complex, has been highly purified. The enzyme has a sedimentation coefficient (s020,w) of 10.3 S and diffusion coefficient (D020,w) of 3.92 x 10-7 cm2 s-1. The weight average molecular weight was estimated to be about 216,000 from the sedimentation equilibrium data. The content of right-handed α helix in the enzyme molecule was estimated to be about 34% by both optical rotatory dispersion and circular dichroism. The enzyme was found to contain 1 molecule of protein-bound thiamine-PP per mole; some other kinetic and protein chemical properties are also reported. In 6 m guanidine hydrochloride (pH 8.0), the enzyme was dissociated into its subunits and the molecular weight of subunit was estimated to be 97,000 from the sedimentation equilibrium data. On polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in sodium dodecyl sulfate the enzyme was dissociated into its subunits with an estimated molecular weight of 113,000. The results indicate that 1 molecule of 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase consists of two similar subunits, which contains NH2-terminal alanine."
https://openalex.org/W1568517269,"Abstract The kinetics of the rabbit muscle enolase-catalyzed dehydration of 2-phosphoglycerate to phosphoenolpyruvate was investigated by an automated fluorometric procedure. All experiments were performed at pH 8.0, 25°, in 0.05 m triethanolamine-HCl-0.2 m KCl. At Mg2+ levels between 5 µm and 240 µm, the apparent Km values for substrate decreased with increasing Mg2+ concentration and the kinetic data could be treated as a simple cyclic equilibrium. At higher Mg2+ concentrations, inhibition by Mg2+ was observed, associated with an apparent dissociation constant of 2 mm. Inhibition by phosphate was competitive with respect to 2-phosphoglycerate and was characterized by a Ki of about 2 mm. Weak inhibition by fluoride, dependent on the Mg2+ concentration, was observed in the absence of phosphate. Inhibition by mixtures of fluoride and phosphate is much stronger than by either anion alone and is due principally to the cooperative binding of these two anions by the enzyme to form an E·Mg2+·F-·Pi complex. Dissociation of fluoride from this complex is characterized by an apparent dissociation constant of 50 µm. In contrast to the Mg2+-dependent reaction, the Km for substrate in the Mn2+-dependent dehydration of 2-P-glycerate was independent of Mn2+ concentration at low levels of the metal ion. The maximum velocity of the Mn2+-dependent reaction was 50 to 60% that of the Mg2+-dependent reaction, and the Ki for fluoride in the presence of phosphate was 40 times higher when Mn2+ instead of Mg2+ was the activating metal ion. Inhibition of the Zn2+-dependent reaction by fluoride was negligible even in the presence of phosphate. The values for the constants suggest direct coordination of fluoride ion to the metal ion. Fluoride ion probably inhibits the reaction by acting as an analog of the hydroxide ion generated during the normal enolase-catalyzed reaction."
https://openalex.org/W1950216371,"Abstract Malic enzyme of pigeon liver (l-malate:NADP+ oxidoreductase (decarboxylating) EC 1.1.1.40) contains a total of approximately 10 —SH groups per subunit, reactive with 5,5'-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB). Two or more exposed groups (Class I) are highly reactive with DTNB; alteration of these groups does not impair the oxidative decarboxylase activity. This activity, however, is lost upon reaction of a less accessible —SH group (Class II), the alteration of which also results in concomitant increase in the ability of this enzyme to reduce pyruvate in the presence of NADPH. The remaining —SH groups (Class III) in the undenatured enzyme are largely unreactive with this reagent. The alkylating reagent N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) induced similar changes in the over-all and reductase activities of this enzyme. These effects by NEM are also attributed to the alteration of Class II —SH group, since they are prevented by reversible attachment of a thionitrobenzoate substituent (from DTNB) to this —SH group prior to reaction with NEM. Modification of Class II —SH group by either reagent is promoted by carboxylic acid substrates, and partially prevented by Mn2+. This group appears to be located at or near the active center of this enzyme, but is not directly involved in the binding of reactants nor in the catalytic process. An —SCN derivative was prepared by reacting the DTNB-modified enzyme with KCN. This derivative was found to be completely active in oxidative decarboxylation. Apparently, the geometry of the active center is such that this activity is impaired by the attachment of a relatively bulky or charged substituent to the Class II —SH group. Furthermore, our experimental data implicate that modification results in the blockage of the reversible C—C bond cleavage step, thereby accounting for the loss of oxidative decarboxylase and decarboxylase activities."

https://openalex.org/W1551802768,Abstract (R)-[1-3H1]ethanol and (S)-[1-3H1]ethanol were oxidized to acetaldehyde using bovine hepatic catalase. The acetaldehyde formed from the S but not the (R)-[1-3H1]ethanol contained tritium. Thus the stereospecificity of catalase for alcohol is the same as that of alcohol dehydrogenase.
https://openalex.org/W2018329818,Short light flashes can appear brighter than longer flashes. This brightness enhancement has often been attributed to neural transients occurring shortly after stimulus onset. This attribution assumes an equivalence between the totality of the response to a stimulus of a given duration and the instantaneous response at a given time after stimulus onset. Recordings from Limulus photoreceptors indicate that this attribution is an example of illusory correlation.
https://openalex.org/W2090855439,Copulating male rats were permitted a maximum of seven intromissions in which to ejaculate. This experimental constraint of the male rat's sexual behavior produced an increase in the number of sessions in which the male ejaculated before the seventh intromrission. This species-specific behavior pattern is therefore susceptible to environmental conditioning.
https://openalex.org/W1972067814,"SYNERGISM studies with the cattle tick Boophilus microplus have been effected by enclosing larvae in packets impregnated with olive oil solutions of the test chemicals and recording mortality after 48 h1,2. In these conditions larvae exposed continuously to 0.4% piperonyl butoxide were apparently unaffected. Subsequently, in studies to determine the sensitivities of the mixed function oxidase systems in organophosphorus (and carbamate) resistant and susceptible strains of B. microplus, larvae were immersed in aqueous colloids3 of piperonyl butoxide. Concentrations greater than 0.02 % proved to be toxic and an LC50 of 0.044% at 24 h after treatment was determined. This unexpected result aroused interest in the acaricidal potential of piperonyl butoxide. Although it is generally regarded as a nontoxic synergist4, some workers have claimed it is toxic to houseflies at fairly high dosage5 but others found it to be nontoxic6; toxicity to the mite Acarus siro (formerly Tyroglyphus farinae) has been recorded7,8."

https://openalex.org/W1570332911,"Abstract N-(n-Hexyl)-O-glucosylsphingosine completely inhibited β-glucosidase in cultured rat astrocytoma (RGC-6) and mouse neuroblastoma cell strains (NB41A and NB2a), creating a model for the infantile Gaucher nervous system. The inhibitor, at a concentration of 5 µg per ml, caused a 5-fold elevation of glucosylceramide in RGC-6 and a 6-fold elevation in NB41A cells. Under these conditions the growth rates of cells were unaffected. Other lysosomal enzymes were only depressed to approximately 80% of normal with the exception of β-glucuronidase (37% of normal); such reductions would not be anticipated to cause abnormal pathology and none was observed. Studies with glucosyl[14C]ceramide (labeled in the stearoyl moiety) showed that the glycolipid was rapidly taken up from the medium. In the presence of the β-glucosidase inhibitor the uptake of glucosylceramide was reduced in NB2a, NB41A, and RGC-6 cells, and in the latter two cell strains no subsequent catabolism could be detected. Studies with more complex glycolipids, such as gangliosides, showed that they were readily taken up and metabolized and that catabolism was not affected by the inhibitor. This was interpreted as evidence for two β-glucosidases, one which utilizes free glucosylceramide and is deficient in Gaucher's disease and the other which acts as an integral part of a multienzyme complex for the degradation of complex glycolipids and has normal activity in Gaucher's disease. Results indicated that specific catabolic reactions may be inhibited by substrate analogs to simulate the pathology of certain genetic diseases in neurons and glia in tissue culture."

https://openalex.org/W1588631590,"Abstract The transcription in vitro of mitochondrial DNA by mitochondrial RNA polymerase from Xenopus laevis has been studied. Nearest neighbor frequencies of the transcribed RNA showed only small deviations from a random pattern. Nascent RNA is bound to the template such that 25 to 35% of the RNA is in a state protected from digestion with ribonuclease. The RNA sediments between 4 and 12 S in sucrose gradients after its release from the template. Mitochondrial RNA polymerase transcribes mtDNA with considerable strand selectivity. With mtDNA-I (closed circular DNA) the heavy (H) strand is preferred about 3:1. With mtDNA-II (nicked circular DNA) the H strand is preferred 20:1. In contrast, denatured mtDNA is transcribed with a 5:1 preference for the light (L) strand. Study of the inhibition of enzyme activity by the rifamycin derivative AF/ABDP suggests that the chain initiation step is more sensitive to the inhibitor than the elongation step. RNA chain initiation in vitro was studied with γ-32P-ribonucleoside triphosphates. Mitochondrial RNA polymerase initiates on mtDNA predominantly with ATP, 2-fold less frequently with GTP, and rarely if at all with the pyrimidine ribonucleoside triphosphates. In pancreatic RNase digests of terminally labeled RNA, at least three but probably many 32P-labeled oligonucleotides were observed, suggesting that in vitro chain initiation occurred at a number of sites on the template."
