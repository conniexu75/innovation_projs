https://openalex.org/W2034396808,"In a time of growing need for catalysts, perovskites have been rediscovered as a family of catalysts of such great diversity that a broad spectrum of scientific disciplines have been brought to bear in their study and application. Because of the wide range of ions and valences which this simple structure can accommodate, the perovskites lend themselves to chemical tailoring. It is relatively simple to synthesize perovskites because of the flexibility of the structure to diverse chemistry. Many of the techniques of ceramic powder preparation are applicable to perovskite catalysts. In their own right, they are therefore of interest as a model system for the correlation of solid-state parameters and catalytic mechanisms. Such correlations [See figure in the PDF file] have recently been found between the rate and selectivity of oxidation-reduction reactions and the thermodynamic and electronic parameters of the solid. For commercial processes such as those mentioned in the introduction, perovskite catalysts have not yet proven to be practical. Much of the initial interest in these catalysts related to their use in automobile exhaust control. Current interest in this field centers on noble metalsubstituted perovskites resistant to S poisoning for single-bed, dual-bed, and three-way catalyst configurations. The formulations commercially tested to date have shown considerable promise, but long-term stability has not yet been achieved. A very large fraction of the elements that make up presently used commercial catalysts can be incorporated in the structure of perovskite oxides. Conversely, it is anticipated that perovskite oxides, appropriately formulated, will show catalytic activity for a large variety of chemical conversions. Even though this expectation is by no means a prediction of commercial success in the face of competition by existing catalyst systems, it makes these oxides attractive models in the study of catalytic chemical conversion. By appropriate formulation many desirable properties can be tailored, including the valence state of transition metal ions, the binding energy and diffusion of O in the lattice, the distance between active sites, and the magnetic and conductive properties of the solid. Only a very small fraction of possible perovskite formulations have been explored as catalysts. It is expected that further investigation will greatly expand the scope of perovskite catalysis, extend the understanding of solid-state parameters in catalysis, and contribute to the development of practical catalytic processes."
https://openalex.org/W2066788988,"The number of white males of college age, who have been the dominant participants in the fields of science and engineering, is predicted to drop significantly in the future. Rapid increases in the participation of women offer some hope of filling anticipated vacancies in the ranks of scientifically trained personnel, although this rapid growth has reached a plateau in many fields. Most studies show that women enter graduate school at about the same rate as men; the dropoff in women's participation occurs sometime before the attainment of the Ph.D. Recent surveys of graduate students indicate that men and women respond differently to the pressures of graduate school and often have a different image of themselves and of their advisers' perceptions of them as graduate students. Some clues from these results may show how the environment can be made more supportive for all students, and for women and minority students in particular."

The inherent energy-selective property of multilayer-coated optics allowed distinct groups of emission lines to be isolated in the solar corona and the transition region. The Cassegrain telescopes provided images in bands centered at 173 and 256 angstroms. The bandpass centered at 173 angstroms is dominated by emission from the ions Fe IX Fe X. This emission is from coronal plasma in the temperature range 0.8 x 10(6) to 1.4 x 10(6)K. The images have angular resolution of about 1.0 to 1.5 arc seconds, and show no degradation because of x-ray scattering. Many features of coronal structure, including magnetically confined loops of hot plasma, coronal plumes, polar coronal holes, faint structures on the size scale of supergranulation and smaller, and features due to overlying cool prominences are visible in the images. The density structure of polar plumes, which are thought to contribute to the solar wind, has been derived from the observations out to 1.7 solar radii."

Whereas U.S.firms put more emphasis on marketing start-up, they put much less emphasis on tooling, equipment, and manufacturing facilities than do Japanese firms. Applied R&D in Japan, which focuses more on processes than in the United States, seems to have yielded a handsome return; but there is no evidence that the rate of return from basic research has been relatively high in Japan. In robotics, the Japanese edge seems to increase as one moves from R&D toward the market."

https://openalex.org/W2045837930,"Domestic or residential structures ranging in age from 6040 to 6850 years old have discovered at the open air site of Asana in the high sierra of southern Peru. These are the earliest domestic structures known from the high elevation zones of the south central Andes, and they are contemporaneous with sites with structures on the north Chilean littoral. Analysis of site structure and content suggests that during the Middle Archaic the site was a logistical camp within a dry punaâ€”high sierra settlement system."
