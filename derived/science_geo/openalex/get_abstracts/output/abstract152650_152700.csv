https://openalex.org/W1986308750,"Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a principal regulator of vasculogenesis and angiogenesis. VEGF expresses its effects by binding to two VEGF receptors, Flt-1 and KDR. However, properties of Flt-1 and KDR in the signal transduction of VEGF-mediated effects in endothelial cells (ECs) were not entirely clarified. We investigated this issue by using two newly developed blocking monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against Flt-1 and KDR. VEGF elicits DNA synthesis and cell migration of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). The pattern of inhibition of these effects by two mAbs indicates that DNA synthesis is preferentially mediated by KDR. In contrast, the regulation of cell migration by VEGF appears to be more complicated. Flt-1 regulates cell migration through modulating actin reorganization, which is essential for cell motility. A distinct signal is generated by KDR, which influences cell migration by regulating cell adhesion via the assembly of vinculin in focal adhesion plaque and tyrosine-phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and paxillin."
https://openalex.org/W1985787257,"A cDNA clone encoding a plasma membrane alanine-preferring transporter (SAT2) has been isolated from glutamatergic neurons in culture and represents the second member of the system A family of neutral amino acid transporters. SAT2 displays a widespread distribution and is expressed in most tissues, including heart, adrenal gland, skeletal muscle, stomach, fat, brain, spinal cord, colon, and lung, with lower levels detected in spleen. No signal is detected in liver or testis. In the central nervous system, SAT2 is expressed in neurons. SAT2 is significantly up-regulated during differentiation of cerebellar granule cells and is absent from astrocytes in primary culture. The functional properties of SAT2, examined using transfected fibroblasts and in cRNA-injected voltage-clamped Xenopus oocytes, show that small aliphatic neutral amino acids are preferred substrates and that transport is voltage- and Na+-dependent (1:1 stoichiometry), pH-sensitive, and inhibited by α-(methylamino)isobutyric acid (MeAIB), a specific inhibitor of system A. Kinetic analyses of alanine and MeAIB uptake by SAT2 are saturable, with Michaelis constants (Km) of 200–500 μm. In addition to its ubiquitous role as a substrate for oxidative metabolism and a major vehicle of nitrogen transport, SAT2 may provide alanine to function as the amino group donor to α-ketoglutarate to provide an alternative source for neurotransmitter synthesis in glutamatergic neurons.

It is distinguished from other neutral amino acid transporters like systems L, ASC, and N by the fact that it recognizesN-methylamino acids such as α-(methylamino)isobutyric acid (MeAIB),1 does not tolerate substitution of Li+ for Na+, and exhibits trans-inhibition (1Barker G.A. Ellory J.C. Exp. Physiol. 1990; 75: 3-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 2Christensen H.N. Physiol. Rev. 1990; 70: 43-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (963) Google Scholar, 3Palacin M. Estevez R. Bertran J. Zorzano A. Physiol. Rev. 1998; 78: 969-1054Crossref PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar). An additional important feature of system A is that it is the major amino acid system subject to regulation by environmental conditions, proliferative stimuli, developmental changes, and hormonal signals (4Guidotti G. Borghetti A.F. Gazzola G.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1978; 515: 329-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar, 5Haussinger D. Lang F. Kilberg M.S. Kilberg M.S. Haussinger D.

J. 1994; 299: 321-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). Such regulation is thought to be directed at system A, because its substrates play key roles in the overall flux of amino acids between tissues and in delivering energy to amino acid metabolism. In the intestine, system A is localized to basolateral membranes where it plays an important role in the generation of α-ketoglutarate, the preferred metabolic fuel of enterocytes over glucose (7Bradford N.M. McGivan J.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 689: 55-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). High intracellular alanine levels generated by system A in enterocytes provide the driving force for glutamine uptake through coupled exchange via system L. Glutamine is then converted to glutamate through phosphate-activated glutaminase (PAG), with production of NH4+, which exits the basolateral membrane. Aminotransaminase converts glutamate and pyruvate to alanine and α-ketoglutarate. Alanine then exits via system L in exchange for additional glutamine. System A, therefore, plays a key role in regulating the availability of essential oxidative metabolites in enterocytes. Alanine is a particularly important nitrogen donor via alanine aminotransferase in peripheral tissues, e.g. the liver and skeletal muscle (8Felig P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1975; 44: 933-955Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar, 9Christensen H.N. Physiol. Rev. 1982; 62: 1193-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), and in the brain (10Westergaard N. Varming T. Peng L. Sonnewald U. Hertz L. Schousboe A. J. Neurosci. Res. 1993; 35: 540-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). In the liver, system A transports alanine to provide carbon atoms for gluconeogenesis and nitrogen for urea production (8Felig P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1975; 44: 933-955Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar, 9Christensen H.N. Physiol. Rev. 1982; 62: 1193-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). System A in liver is known to be up-regulated by glucagon and insulin, facilitating the conversion of amino acids to glucose and stimulating urea nitrogen production (11Christensen H.N. Kilberg M.S. Nutr. Rev. 1995; 53: 74-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). In the heart and muscle, system A, together with the glutamine transport system N, likely plays an important role in the synthesis of oxidative fuel. The different roles alanine plays in different tissues (8Felig P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1975; 44: 933-955Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar, 9Christensen H.N. Physiol. Rev. 1982; 62: 1193-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), the different factors (insulin, glucagon, amino acid deprivation, hyperosmotic stress, etc.) that affect the regulation of system A in different tissues (4Guidotti G. Borghetti A.F. Gazzola G.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1978; 515: 329-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar, 5Haussinger D. Lang F. Kilberg M.S. Kilberg M.S. Haussinger D.

Biophys. 1994; 312: 308-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) strongly suggest that a multiplicity of discrete system A isoforms exist. We have recently cloned and functionally identified a neuronal glutamine transporter (GlnT), the first member of the system A family of transporters (17Varoqui H. Zhu H. Yao D. Ming H. Erickson J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4049-4054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). GlnT was cloned based upon its weak similarity to a family of plasma membrane transporters that are found in plants, yeast, and Caenorhabditis elegans amino acid/auxin permease (AAAP) and to the transporter that mediates uptake of inhibitory amino acid neurotransmitters (VIAAT/VGAT) into synaptic vesicles (18McIntire S.L. Reimer R.J. Schuske K. Edwards R.H. Jorgensen E.M. Nature. 1997; 389: 870-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (681) Google Scholar, 19Sagne C. El Mestikawy S. Isambert M.F. Hamon M. Henry J.P. Giros B. Gasnier B. FEBS Lett. 1997; 417: 177-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 20Young G.B. Jack D.L. Smith D.W. Saier Jr., M.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1415: 306-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). GlnT expression occurs predominantly in nervous tissue and is expressed on the plasma membrane of glutamatergic and some (GABA)ergic (e.g. cerebellar Purkinje cells) neurons. GlnT is a highly efficient glutamine transporter and may be a physiologically important gateway for the precursor of neurotransmitter glutamate via the glutamate/glutamine cycle. Examination of the transport properties of GlnT revealed that not all classical system A substrates (e.g. proline and glycine) could compete with [14C]MeAIB for uptake. In addition, GlnT expression was not found in peripheral organs known to express system A. This indicated that additional members of system A exist and may be expected to express different substrate preferences and display unique tissue specificity. Here, we report the cloning and characterization of SAT2, the second member of the system A family of neutral amino acid transporters. SAT2 displays a widespread distribution and exhibits broad specificity for neutral amino acids with a preference for alanine. SAT2 is also enriched on glutamatergic neurons in the brain, where it may be an important gateway for alanine uptake to serve, in part, as an amino group donor and alternative precursor of transmitter glutamate. Because alanine plays a key role as a vehicle of nitrogen transport and as an end product of nitrogen catabolism in many tissues, the identification SAT2 will facilitate molecular studies on its functional roles and regulation in various physiological and pathological states. Cerebellar primary cultures were prepared from 8-day postnatal (P8) Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats as described (21Gallo V. Ciotti M.T. Coletti A. Aloisi F. Levi G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 7919-7923Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Cerebella were removed from decapitated rat pups, minced, and digested with trypsin (0.25 mg/ml) for 15 min at 37 °C in HEPES-buffered Lebowitz medium containing 0.3% bovine serum albumin. The cell suspension was then placed into Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) with 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and centrifuged at 300 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. This treatment was followed by trituration with a Pasteur pipette in DNase I (50 μg/ml) containing DMEM/5% FBS. The cell suspension was allowed to settle for 15 min at room temperature, and the supernatant was transferred to a centrifuge tube on ice. This trituration step was repeated two more times, and the combined supernatants were centrifuged as above. The cell pellet was resuspended in DMEM containing 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, and 100 μg/ml penicillin/streptomycin and plated at a density of 15 or 3.75 × 105 cells (neuronal and astrocytic cultures, respectively) in 65 mm-diameter plastic dishes coated with 10 μg/ml polyornithine. The medium for neuronal cultures also contained 25 mm KCl (final concentration). After 18 h, 10 μm cytosine arabinoside was added to the neuronal cultures to prevent the replication of non-neuronal cells. The astrocyte culture medium was changed at day 3 in vitro and every other day afterward. The neuronal culture medium was 50% refreshed at day 7. An oligo(dT)-primed, size-selected cDNA library from cerebellar granule cells (10 days in culture) that was constructed in CDM7/amp, a modified T7 promoter bearing plasmid expression vector, was used (17Varoqui H. Zhu H. Yao D. Ming H. Erickson J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4049-4054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Successive subdivisions of the library were screened with a cDNA probe made from a 319-base pair fragment of expressed sequence tag (EST) 184296 amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using the following two primers, 5′-GGCAACTCATATTTCACTATGAAGAGGTAGC-3′ and 5′-CCAGGTACTACTTCCTTTGGAATGTCAGTA-3′ from a human colon cDNA library, gel-purified, and 32P-labeled using [32P]dCTP (NEN Life Science Products) by random priming (Bio-Rad). This fragment corresponds to the conserved putative first membrane-spanning segment of the yeast AAAP homologues (20Young G.B. Jack D.L. Smith D.W. Saier Jr., M.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1415: 306-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) and to region I of VIAA/VGAT (18McIntire S.L. Reimer R.J. Schuske K. Edwards R.H. Jorgensen E.M. Nature. 1997; 389: 870-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (681) Google Scholar, 19Sagne C. El Mestikawy S. Isambert M.F. Hamon M. Henry J.P. Giros B. Gasnier B. FEBS Lett. 1997; 417: 177-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Southern blots of EcoRI restriction digests of plasmid prepared from overnight cultures were hybridized overnight at 45 °C in a buffer containing 5× SSC; 25% formamide; 5 × Denhardt's solution; 50 mm NaPO4 (pH 6.5); 0.1% SDS; 250 μg/ml tRNA and the denatured radiolabeled cDNA probe (106cpm/ml). The filters were washed at 1× SSC; 0.1% SDS at 60 °C. Autoradiographs were analyzed using a BAS2000 phosphor-imaging system (Fuji Biomedical) after 12-h exposure. A 4.2-kilobase (kb) cDNA was obtained and subcloned into pUC18, and overlapping fragments were sequenced in both directions with the Thermo Sequenase Cycle sequencing kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The coding region for the N-terminal hydrophilic portion of SAT2 (amino acids 1–65) was amplified by PCR using the primers, 5′-CGGGATCCATGAAGACCGAAATGGGAAGGTC-3′ and 5′-GGAATTCCTAGTCTGTTTCGTACTTCTTCTTCCCCAGAT-3′, which include 5′-appended BamHI and EcoRI sites (underlined) and an internal stop (italics). This fragment was subcloned into the bacterial expression vector pGEX-KT, and the resulting plasmid was transfected into BL21 cells. Recombinant glutathione S-transferase fusion protein was isolated using a purification module (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and then the N terminus of SAT2 was released following thrombin cleavage according to the manufacturer's instructions. Polyclonal antibodies were produced using the resulting 6-kDa N terminus of rat SAT2 in rabbits by Macromolecular Resources at Colorado State University. Poly(A)+ RNA was purified from different rat tissues by guanidine isothiocyanate extraction and ultracentrifugation through a cesium trifluoroacetic acid cushion followed by a single round of oligo(dT)-cellulose chromatography (22Yokota R. Arai K. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 3-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). 5 μg of RNA (A 260/280 > 1.9) was electrophoresed through formaldehyde-agarose gels and stained with ethidium bromide to assure that equivalent amounts of RNA were loaded into each lane. The RNA was then electroblotted onto nylon membranes and hybridized with a oligonucleotide probe (48-mer) against 3′ non-coding sequences of SAT2 (bases 1926–1973) radiolabeled using terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase (Life Technologies, Inc.) and [32P]dATP (NEN Life Science Products) or random-primed full-length SAT2 cDNA in buffer containing 5× SSC, 50% formamide, 5× Denhardt's solution, 50 μm NaPO4 (pH 6.5), 0.1% SDS, 250 μg/ml tRNA for 18 h at 45 °C. The filters were washed in 1× SSC, 0.1% SDS at 60 °C (oligo probe) or 0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS at 55 °C (cDNA probe) and exposed to Kodak X-Omat film with an intensifying screen at −70 °C. Sagittal fresh-frozen rat brain sections (15 μm) were fixed on slides in 4% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 15 min at room temperature followed by three 5-min washes in PBS. The slides were then immersed in 0.1m triethanolamine, pH 8, and acetic anhydride (0.25% final) was added under fast stirring. After 10-min incubation, the sections were rinsed in diethylpyrocarbonate-treated water, dehydrated, and delipidated as follows: 70% EtOH for 1 min, 96% EtOH for 1 min, twice 100% EtOH for 2 min, twice chloroform for 5 min, 100% EtOH for 2 min, 96% EtOH for 1 min, and then air-dried. The SAT2 cRNA hybridization probe was prepared as follows: aKpnI-HindIII 3′-non-coding fragment of SAT2 (bases 2583–2913) was subcloned into pBluescript KS (Stratagene) and linearized with KpnI and HindIII to generate riboprobes in antisense (T7 polymerase-catalyzed transcription) and sense (T3 polymerase-catalyzed transcription) orientation, respectively. In vitro transcription was performed using 250 ng of linearized plasmid, 62 μCi of [35S]dUTP (NEN Life Science Products), and the Riboprobe Combination System T3/T7 (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For hybridization, the sections were covered with hybridization mix containing 80,000 dpm/μl 35S-labeled cRNA probe in hybridization buffer (50% formamide, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 315 mm NaCl, 10% dextran sulfate, 1× Denhardt's, 0.1 mg/ml salmon sperm DNA, 0.25 mg/ml yeast tRNA, 0.25 mg/ml yeast total RNA, 10 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), 0.1% sodium thiosulfate, 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate) and then coverslipped. After hybridization for 18 h in a humid chamber placed in a 56 °C convection oven, coverslips were removed in 1× SSC/1 mm DTT. Sections were washed twice for 15 min in 1× SSC/1 mm DTT; treated with 20 μg/ml RNase A and 1 unit/ml RNase T in 0.5 m NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 1 mm EDTA for 30 min at 37 °C; and then washed successively in 1, 0.5, and 0.2× SSC/1 mm DTT for 15 min each at room temperature and twice in 0.2 × SSC/1 mmDTT for 20 min at 60 °C. The slides were briefly dipped in water then in 70% ethanol, air-dried, and exposed to Kodak Biomax x-ray film for 96 h. For primary cultures, cells were rinsed with PBS, harvested by scraping in PBS, centrifuged, and resuspended in PBS containing 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 mg/l pepstatin, 5 mg/l leupeptin, and 5 mg/l aprotinin, sonicated, and centrifuged at 2000 ×g for 5 min. The resulting supernatants were kept frozen at −80 °C until further use. 5 μg of SDS-solubilized cell extracts were size-fractionated under reducing conditions on 8% acrylamide gels and electrophoretically transferred to an nitrocellulose membrane using standard protocols. SAT2, synaptophysin (p38), and glial fibrillary acidic protein were detected using the respective primary antibodies, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Sigma) followed by exposure to film. Monkey kidney fibroblasts (CV-1 cells) were plated on collagen-coated 12-well dishes (2 × 105 cells/well) in DMEM containing 10% FBS, penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (100 mg/ml), and glutamine (4 mm). Cells were rinsed with DMEM without serum, antibiotics, or glutamine, infected with recombinant T7 vaccinia virus at 10 plaque-forming units/cell for 30 min, and then transfected with plasmid containing SAT2 cDNA in CDM7/amp (1 μg/ml) by lipofection in the same medium (23Fuerst T.R. Niles E.G. Studier F.W. Moss B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 8122-8126Crossref PubMed Scopus (1875) Google Scholar). After 16 h the cells were rinsed with uptake buffer containing 125 mm NaCl, 4.8 mm KCl, 1.2 mmKH2P04, 1.2 mm MgS04, 1.2 mm CaCl2, 5.6 mm glucose, and 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, and preincubated in the same buffer for 5 min at 37 °C. The medium was removed and replaced with fresh buffer at the indicated pH values to which various concentrations of unlabeled alanine or glutamine and 2.5 μCi of [3H]alanine or [3H]glutamine or 0.25 μCi (10 μm) of [14C]MeAIB (NEN Life Science Products) was added. For inhibition studies, 1.5 mmunlabeled amino acids were mixed with [14C]MeAIB. Cells were placed in a 37 °C incubator for 2.5 min, and uptake was terminated with a 2.5-ml wash in 4 °C buffer on ice. For Na+-free media, NaCl was replaced with equimolar choline Cl or LiCl. For Cl−-free media, NaCl was replaced with equimolar NaNO2 or sodium gluconate. Cells were then solubilized in 1 ml of 1% SDS, and radioactivity was measured by scintillation counting in 5 ml of EcoScint (National Diagnostics). Transport measurements were performed in duplicate and repeated at least three times using independent infection/transfections. All experimental conditions with SAT2-transfected cells had corresponding mock-transfected cells in adjacent wells. Oocytes were isolated from Xenopus laevis(under 2-aminoethylbenzoate anesthesia), treated with collagenase A (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and stored at 18 °C in modified Barths' medium (24Mackenzie B. Van Winkle L.J. Biomembrane Transport. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1999: 327-342Crossref Google Scholar). SAT2 cDNA was subcloned into the pTLNii vector under SP6, and SAT2 cRNA was synthesized in vitro using the Ambion mMESSAGE mMACHINE 228 kit. Oocytes were injected with 50 ng of SAT2 cRNA and incubated 2 days before performing radiotracer or voltage-clamp experiments at 22 °C. Standard Na+ uptake medium comprised 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.5 with Tris base). For Na+-free or low Na+ media, NaCl was replaced by equimolar choline chloride. For pH sensitivity experiments, Na+ media were buffered at pH 6.5–8.6 using 0–5 mm MES, 0–5 mm HEPES, and 0–5 mm Tris base. A two-microelectrode voltage clamp was used to measure currents in control (water-injected) oocytes and oocytes injected with SAT2 cRNA. Microelectrodes (resistance, 0.5–3 mΩ) were filled with 3 m KCl. Oocytes were clamped at a holding potential (V h) of −50 mV and step-changes in membrane potential (Vm) applied (from +50 to −150 mV in 20-mV increments), each for a duration of 100 ms, before and after the addition of substrate; current was low-pass-filtered at 500 Hz and digitized at 5 kHz. Test solutions were washed out with substrate-free medium (100 mm choline chloride) at pH 7.5 for several minutes. Steady-state data (obtained by averaging the points over the final 16.7 ms at each Vm step) were fitted to Eq. 11.3 of Mackenzie (24Mackenzie B. Van Winkle L.J. Biomembrane Transport. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1999: 327-342Crossref Google Scholar), for which I is the evoked current (i.e. the difference in steady-state current measured in the presence and absence of substrate), I max the derived current maximum, S the concentration of substrate S (Na+ or amino acid), K0.5S the substrate concentration at which current was half-maximal, and n H the Hill coefficient for S. Additionally, continuous current monitoring was performed atV h = −70 mV, for which the current was low-pass-filtered at 20 Hz (sampling at 1 Hz). Na+/l-alanine coupling stoichiometry was determined by direct comparison of net inward charge with [3H]alanine accumulation in individual oocytes under voltage clamp (24Mackenzie B. Van Winkle L.J. Biomembrane Transport. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1999: 327-342Crossref Google Scholar, 25Mackenzie B. Loo D.D.F. Wright E.M. J. Membr. Biol. 1998; 162: 101-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Oocytes were clamped atV h = −70 mV and superfused with standard Na+ medium (pH 7.5) plus 500 μml-[3H]alanine (NEN Life Science Products; final specific activity, 1–2 MBq·mmol−1) for 5 min before washing out with Na+ medium. The alanine-evoked current was integrated with time to obtain the alanine-dependent charge (Q Ala) and converted to a molar equivalent using the Faraday conversion. Oocytes were solubilized with 10% SDS, and the 3H content was measured by liquid scintillation counting. Our cloning strategy began with a search of the EST data base for distant mammalian homologues of the vesicular GABA/glycine transporter. A human colon EST was found that displayed moderate sequence identity (25–45%) within the first putative transmembrane domain (TMD) to a large family of putative amino acid permeases in the AAAP family of plants, yeast, and C. elegans and in mammals. This EST was homologous to, but differed significantly from, the degenerate oligonucleotide probe used to clone GlnT (17Varoqui H. Zhu H. Yao D. Ming H. Erickson J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4049-4054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). We screened a rat cDNA library prepared from glutamatergic neuronal cultures with PCR-amplified sequences from this human EST that we obtained from a human colon cDNA library. A cDNA clone with an open reading frame of 1514 bp predicting a highly hydrophobic protein of 504 amino acids and a molecular mass of 55,554 daltons was obtained (Fig. 1). Hydropathy analysis suggests 11 hydrophobic membrane-spanning segments (TMD). The absence of a signal sequence for membrane insertion in the N terminus suggests that it is retained in the cytoplasm leaving the short C terminus located extracellularly. The granule cell cDNA clone has two potential sites for N-linked glycosylation between putative TMDs 5 and 6. Consensus sequences for phosphorylation by protein kinase C exist on the predicted cytoplasmic domain between putative TMDs 6 and 7.

By Northern analysis, the mRNA (∼4.8 kb) was found to be expressed in most tissues examined, including heart, adrenal gland, skeletal muscle, stomach, fat, brain, spinal cord, colon, and lung, with lower levels detected in spleen, and was absent from testis (Fig. 2). Surprisingly, SAT2 mRNA was present at very low levels in liver, if at all. Equivalent levels of RNA loaded in each well and the lane assignments were confirmed by ethidium staining and by probing with GlnT, a neuron-enriched system A isoform, and with a recently identified homologous isoform specifically enriched in liver (data not shown). In addition, an independent Northern blot was reprobed with SAT2, and no expression in liver was observed. To avoid possible cross-hybridization with homologous family members of system A, Northern blots were probed with a 3′-non-coding oligonucleotide as well as with a full-length cDNA probe washed at high stringency with identical results. Interestingly, the areas containing the most SAT2 mRNA were regions containing neurons (brain and spinal cord) and neuroendocrine cells (adrenal) as well as the intestine and kidney.In situ hybridization of rat brain sections revealed strong labeling in the pyriform cortex, hippocampus, and cerebellar granule layer, regions of the brain that contain neurons that use glutamate as their transmitter (Fig. 3 A). Specificity of labeling was confirmed using the sense SAT2 probe (Fig.3 B). In contrast to GlnT, SAT2 mRNA was not observed in cerebellar Purkinje neurons. In situ hybridization of rat spinal cord sections with SAT2 revealed strong labeling of cholinergic motor neurons (data not shown). We also examined the expression of SAT2 in primary cultures of rat cerebellar granule cells, which are a good model for glutamatergic neurons. High levels of expression are observed in neuronal cultures, whereas parallel astrocyte cultures are devoid of immunoreactivity (Fig. 3 C). In the neuronal cultures, specific immunoreactivity increases concomitantly with the morphological differentiation of the cells (Fig. 3 D). The stimulus-coupled release of glutamate also develops gradually and concomitantly with neuronal differentiation in these cultures (21Gallo V. Ciotti M.T. Coletti A. Aloisi F. Levi G. Proc. Natl.

COX-1 is considered a housekeeping enzyme constitutively expressed in most tissues, whereas the COX-2 isoform is induced by several stimuli including cytokines and mitogens and is thought to be responsible for the increased production of prostaglandins in pathologic processes (reviewed in Refs. 1Smith W.

We have recently shown that COX-2 expression is induced in T cells upon T cell receptor (TCR) activation playing an important role in controlling this process (15Iniguez M.A. Punzon C. Fresno M. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 111-119PubMed Google Scholar). However, no studies about COX-2 promoter regulation in these cells have been reported so far. Activation of T cells triggers a complex regulatory cascade of events that culminates in the induced transcription of a variety of activation-associated genes (16Ullman K. Northrop J. Verweij C. Crabtree G. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1990; 8: 421-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar, 17Weiss A. Littman D.R.

Many of them are cytokines that in turn regulate cell proliferation, differentiation, and acquisition of effector functions by cells of the immune system. The signal transduction pathways involved in T cell activation include those mediated by calcium and protein kinase C (PKC) that contribute to the induction and activation of several transcription factors including nuclear factor κB, AP-1, NFAT and octamer binding factors, known to regulate cytokine gene expression (19Crabtree G.R. Clipstone N.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 1045-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar). The rise in intracellular calcium triggered by antigen binding to the TCR·CD3 complex leads to the activation of calcineurin phosphatase activity, which dephosphorylates cytoplasmic members of the NFAT family of transcription factors (20Clipstone N.A.

Dephosphorylated NFAT proteins enter the nucleus and interact with Fos and Jun family members to cooperatively bind to and transactivate NFAT sites (24Shaw K.T. Ho A.M. Raghavan A. Kim J. Jain J.

Nature. 1996; 382: 370-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). This process of T cell activation and transcription of cytokine genes is blocked by inhibition of calcineurin phosphatase activity by the immunosuppressive drug cyclosporin A (CsA) (26Schreiber S. Crabtree G. Immunol. Today. 1992; 13: 136-142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1971) Google Scholar, 27O'Keefe S.J. Tamura J. Kincaid R.L. Tocci M.J. O'Neill E.A.

Here we have analyzed the regulation of COX-2gene expression in human T cells, showing that COX-2 promoter activity was induced upon T cell activation in a CsA-sensitive manner. Conversely, expression of a calcineurin constitutively active catalytic subunit increased promoter activity. Further analysis involved NFAT and AP-1 transcription factors in the regulation of COX-2 expression. Finally, we localized two NFAT binding sites in the −117 and −81 positions from the transcription start site required for induction of COX-2 promoter activity. These results indicate that Ca2+/calcineurin and PKC/AP-1 signaling transduction pathways are essential for induction of COX-2gene expression in T cells. The Jurkat human leukemic T cell line was cultured in RPMI medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 2 mm glutamine and antibiotics. Purified human peripheral blood T lymphocytes (PBTs) were obtained as described previously (15Iniguez M.A. Punzon C. Fresno M. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 111-119PubMed Google Scholar) from partially purified human blood by the Ficoll-Hypaque gradient. The peripheral blood lymphocyte fraction was plated, and a not adherent population was passed through a nylon fiber wool column. Cells were collected and resuspended in RPMI plus 10% fetal bovine serum and 2 mml-glutamine and antibiotics. The purity of the PBT population, detected by flow cytometry, was always greater than 95% CD3+ cells. Cells were stimulated by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA; Sigma) at 15 ng/ml and/or A23187 calcium ionophore (Ion; Sigma) at 1 μm. CsA (Sandoz) (100 ng/ml) was added 1 h before the addition of PMA and Ion. Human COX-2 promoter constructs were generated by cloning BamHI-BglII-flanked PCR products derived from Jurkat genomic DNA into the BglII-digested pXP2LUC reporter plasmid (29Nordeen S.K. BioTechniques. 1988; 6: 454-458PubMed Google Scholar). An unique reverse primer starting from +104 bp was used for PCR amplification (5′-gggagatctGGTAGGCTTTGCTGTCTGAGG-3′). Different forward primers lying in the 5′-region of the transcription start site of the promoter were used to obtain the deletion constructs: −1796, 5′-gggggatccGGATTCTAACATGGCTTCTAACCC-3′; −998, 5′-gggggatccTTACCAGTATCTCCTATGAAGGGC-3′; −521, 5′-gggggatccCCAGTCTGTCCCGACGTGACTTCC-3′; −327, 5′-gggggatccGCGCTCGGGCAAAGACTGCGAAG-3′; −170, 5′-gggggatccCTCATTTCCGTGGGTAAAAAACCC-3′; −88, 5′-gggggatccGGTACGAAAAGGCGG-3′; −46, 5′-gggggatccGCTTGGTTTTCAGTC-3′. The sequence of all PCR-derived constructs was confirmed by fluorescent automatic sequencing (Centro de Biologı́a Molecular, DNA facility, Madrid, Spain). The ΔCAM-AI plasmid encoded a deletion mutant of a murine calcineurin catalytic subunit (27O'Keefe S.J. Tamura J. Kincaid R.L. Tocci M.J. O'Neill E.A.

The pCMV-TAM67 plasmid encoding a dominant negative mutant variant of c-Jun (32Petrak D. Memon S.A. Birrer M.J. Ashwell J.D. Zacharchuk C.M. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 2046-2051PubMed Google Scholar) was a gift of C. M. Zacharchuck. Total RNA was prepared from Jurkat T cells by the TRIzol reagent RNA protocol (Life Technologies, Inc.). Total RNA (1 μg) was reverse transcribed into cDNA and used for PCR amplification with either human COX-2, or glyceraldehide-3-phosphate dehydrogenase specific primers by the RNA PCR core kit (Perkin-Elmer) as described previously (15Iniguez M.A. Punzon C. Fresno M. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 111-119PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the PCR reaction was amplified by 20–35 cycles of denaturation at 94 °C for 1 min, annealing at 60 °C for 1 min, and extension at 72 °C for 1 min. Amplified cDNAs were separated by agarose gel electrophoresis and bands visualized by ethidium bromide staining. The data shown correspond to a number of cycles where the amount of amplified product is proportional to the abundance of starting material. Transcriptional activity was measured using luciferase reporter gene assays in transiently transfected Jurkat cells or PBTs. Jurkat cells were transfected by Lipofectin reagent as recommended by the manufacturer (Life Technologies, Inc.). Briefly, exponential growing cells (1.5 × 106) were incubated for 8 h at 37 °C with a mixture of 1.5 μg/ml of the correspondent reporter plasmid and 3 μg/ml Lipofectin in 1 ml of Opti-MEM. In cotransfection experiments, 0.15–1.5 μg/ml of the correspondent expression plasmid was included. The total amount of DNA in each transfection was kept constant by using the corresponding empty expression vectors. Cells were then resuspended in complete medium and incubated at 37 °C an for additional 16 h. PBT transfection was performed by electroporation at 320 V and 1500 microfarads with a Bio-Rad Gene Pulser II (Bio-Rad). For electroporation, cells were resuspended at 1 × 107cells/0.5 ml in complete medium with 10 μg of plasmid DNA. After electroporation cells were cultured in fresh medium at 37 °C for 16 h. Transfected cells were exposed to different stimuli as indicated. Then, cells were harvested and lysed. Luciferase activity was determined by using a luciferase assay kit (Promega) with a luminometer Monolight 2010 (Analytical Luminescence Laboratory, San Diego, CA). Transfection experiments were performed either in duplicate or triplicate. The data presented are expressed as the mean of the determinations in relative luciferase units (RLUs) ± S.D. A representative experiment from the several performed is shown in all cases. In vitro-directed mutagenesis was performed by the QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Synthetic oligonucleotide primers containing the desired mutation and complementary to opposite strands of the corresponding COX-2 promoter constructs were extended by using Pfu turbo DNA polymerase, generating a mutated plasmid: COX-2 dNFAT mutant primer 5′- GGGGAGAGGAGttAAcAATTTGTGGGGGGTACG-3′, COX-2 pNFAT mutant primer 5′- GGGGTACGAAAAGGCGtctAGAAACAGctgTTTCGTCACATGGG -3′, and COX-2 CRE mutant primer 5′- GAAACAGTCATTTgagCtCATGGGCTTGGTTTTCAG - 3′. The oligonucleotide 5′- GAAACAGctgTTTgagCtCATGGGCTTGGTTTTCAG- 3′ was used to generate the double mutant P2–192 pNFAT and CRE-MUT by using the construct P2–192 pNFAT MUT as the template. Lowercase letters in the sequence of the primers indicate mutated positions. Mutagenesis of more than one site was done by subsequent mutation of the corresponding previously mutated construct. The nucleotide sequence of the mutants was confirmed by automatic DNA sequencing. Nuclear extracts from Jurkat cells unstimulated or stimulated with 15 ng/ml PMA plus 1 μm Ion were prepared as described previously (33Martinez-Martinez S. Gomez del Arco P. Armesilla A.L. Aramburu J. Luo C. Rao A. Redondo J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6437-6447Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Cells were resuspended in 400 μl of ice-cold buffer A (10 mmHEPES, pH 7.6, 10 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 0.75 mm Spermidine, 0.15 mm Spermine, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mmNa2MoO4, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, and leupeptin and aprotinin at 2 μg/ml each). After 15 min on ice, cells were lysed with 0.6% (v/v) Nonidet P-40. The nuclear pellet was extracted with 50 μl of buffer C (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 0.4m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mm Na2MoO4, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, and leupeptin and aprotinin at 4 μg/ml each). Nuclear extracts were collected and stored at −80 °C. Protein concentration was determined by the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). Gel retardation assays were performed as in Martı́nez-Martı́nez et al. (33Martinez-Martinez S. Gomez del Arco P. Armesilla A.L. Aramburu J. Luo C. Rao A. Redondo J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6437-6447Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Nuclear extracts (3–5 μg) were incubated with 1 mg/ml of poly(dI-dC) in DNA binding buffer (2% (w/v) polivinyl ethanol, 2.5% (v/v) glycerol, 10 mm Tris, pH 8, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mmdithiothreitol on ice for 10 min. Then, 100,000 cpm of32P-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotides was added and incubated at room temperature for 40 min. In competition experiments, a 20-fold molar excess of unlabeled oligonucleotides was added to the binding reaction mixture prior to the probe. Supershift assays were performed by incubating nuclear extracts with either preimmune serum or anti-all NFATs antisera prior to the addition of the probe. Anti-all NFATs 674 rabbit antiserum was raised against the synthetic peptide NH2- SDIELRKGETDIGRKNTRC coupled to carrier protein hemocyanin as described by Liu et al. (34Liu F.T. Zinnecker M. Hamaoka T. Katz D.H. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 690-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). This peptide has been previously used to generate the anti-all NFATs 796 antiserum that efficiently recognized NFAT-1, -2, -3, and -4 members (35Lyakh L. Ghosh P. Rice N.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2475-2484Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). DNA·protein complexes were resolved by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on a 4% nondenaturing gel. The sequences of the oligonucleotides (5′ to 3′) used were: gatcGGAGGAAAAACTGTTTCATACAGAAGGCGT (distal NFAT site of the human IL-2 promoter), CGCTTGATGAGTCAGCCGGGAA (AP-1 consensus oligonucleotide), ATTCGATCGGGGCGGGGCGAGC (SP-1 consensus oligonucleotide), tcgaCAAGGGGAGAGGAGGGAAAAATTTGTGGC (nucleotides −117 to −91 containing the putative NFAT distal site of the COX-2 promoter), tcgaCAAAAGGCGGAAAGAAACAGTCATTTC (nucleotides −82 to −58 including the putative NFAT/AP-1 proximal site of the COX-2 promoter). We have previously shown that COX-2gene expression is induced in T cells by stimuli resembling T cell activation such as TCR cross-linking or phorbol ester plus calcium ionophore treatment (15Iniguez M.A. Punzon C. Fresno M. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 111-119PubMed Google Scholar, 36Pablos J.L. Santiago B. Carreira P.E. Galindo M. Gomez-Reino J.J. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 1999; 115: 86-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). To further explore the transcriptional regulation of this gene, we studied the COX-2 promoter-driven transcription in transiently transfected Jurkat T cells and human PBTs. For this purpose we cloned a region spanning from −1796 to +104 bp relative to the transcription start site of the human COX-2gene in the reporter plasmid pXP2 (P2–1900). As shown in Fig.1 A, luciferase activity of this construct was strongly up-regulated upon activation by PMA plus Ion, a treatment that mimics T cell activation. To map the regions responsible for this induction, subsequent 5′-deletions ranging from −998 down to −170 bp were generated. Although absolute values for basal activity of these constructs slightly varied, inducibility for all of them were similar. It was also noticeable that basal activity of a construct spanning −898 bp from the transcription start site of the COX-1 promoter (P1–1009) was not induced upon PMA plus Ion treatment (Fig. 1 A). Combined treatment with PMA plus Ion was required to get the maximal induction (8–12-fold) of COX-2 promoter constructs in Jurkat T cells. PMA treatment alone led a 2–3-fold induction, whereas single treatment with calcium ionophore did not induce transcription from this promoter at all (Fig. 1 B). Moreover, no differences were observed again among the different COX-2 promoter constructs. Similar results were obtained when these COX-2 promoter constructs were transfected in purified human resting T lymphocytes isolated from peripheral blood. As shown in Fig. 1 C, luciferase activity of transfected constructs P2–1906 and P2–274 was induced by PMA or PMA plus Ion in purified T lymphocytes thus confirming the data obtained in the Jurkat T cell line in a more physiological setting. To compare the regulation of the promoter with the expression of the endogenous gene in T cells, RNA isolated from Jurkat cells was analyzed by reverse transcriptase-PCR. Whereas PMA treatment slightly induced COX-2 expression, maximal induction occurred after PMA plus Ion treatment. However, treatment with Ion alone did not increase COX-2 expression (Fig. 1 D). These results demonstrated that regulation of COX-2 promoter activity paralleled transcriptional activation of the endogenous gene in T cells. COX-2 mRNA induction was completely abolished by treatment with the immunosuppressive drug CsA in Jurkat T cells (Fig. 1 D). To determine whether this CsA-mediated inhibition occurred by interference with the transcriptional activity of the human COX-2 promoter, we transfected T cells with the P2–1906 and P2–274 promoter constructs and analyzed their activity upon activation in the presence of CsA. Treatment with CsA abrogated induced luciferase activity of the P2–1900 and P2–274 promoter constructs both in Jurkat cells and PBTs (Fig. 2, A and B). The fact that COX-2 promoter activity was CsA-sensitive pointed to an involvement of the Ca2+/calmodulin phosphatase calcineurin, the major target of CsA, in the transcriptional induction of the COX-2gene in T lymphocytes. Calcineurin is responsible for NFAT dephosphorylation and subsequently for the NFAT-dependent transactivation of genes (20Clipstone N.A. Crabtree G.R.

Immunol. 1997; 15: 707-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (2227) Google Scholar). To further confirm the role of calcineurin in the regulation of COX-2 expression, we cotransfected the P2–274 promoter construct along with an expression plasmid (ΔCAM-AI) encoding a deletion mutant of a murine constitutively active calcineurin catalytic subunit. ΔCAM-AI has been previously described to efficiently substitute the calcium signal for activation of NFAT-driven transcription. Cotransfection of ΔCAM-AI is sufficient to fully activate the IL-4 promoter that can be maximally induced by a calcium signal alone (38Kubo M. Kincaid R.L. Webb D.R. Ransom J.T. Int. Immunol. 1994; 6: 179-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Moreover, this mutant is able to act in synergy with PMA bypassing the calcium requirement for induction of NFAT-mediated transcription of the IL-2 promoter that requires costimulation of calcium and PKC-mediated signaling pathways for full activation (27O'Keefe S.J. Tamura J. Kincaid R.L. Tocci M.J. O'Neill E.A. Nature. 1992; 357: 692-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (788) Google Scholar). Cotransfection of ΔCAM-AI slightly induced P2–274 COX-2 promoter basal activity but strongly cooperated with PMA to activate the COX-2 promoter in a similar way as for the IL-2 promoter (Fig. 3). The above results indicate that COX-2 promoter regulation was very similar to that described for the IL-2 promoter because of the inhibition by CsA and the induction by calcineurin. It has been shown that two functional NFAT sites in the IL-2 promoter are essential for the calcineurin-mediated regulation of the expression of this gene (19Crabtree G.R. Clipstone N.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 1045-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar, 37Rao A. Luo C. Hogan P.G. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 707-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (2227) Google Scholar,39Jain J. Lom C. Rao A. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1995; 7: 333-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). To tested whether NFAT might be important for the regulation of COX-2 promoter activity as well, we performed cotransfection experiments using an NFATc (NFAT2 and NFATc1) expression vector together with the P2–274 construct or the IL2-LUC reporter plasmid included as a control. In agreement with the proposed role of NFAT as a critical regulator of the IL-2gene (31Northrop J.P. Ho S.N. Chen L. Thomas D.J. Timmerman L.A. Nolan G.P. Admon A. Crabtree G.R. Nature. 1994; 369: 497-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar), overexpression of the NFAT protein efficiently transactivated the IL-2 promoter. Interestingly, COX-2 promoter activity was similarly enhanced by NFATc cotransfection (Fig. 4 A). Moreover, cotransfection of Jurkat T cells with a dominant negative version of NFATc previously described to abolish IL-2 promoter activity (31Northrop J.P. Ho S.N. Chen L. Thomas D.J. Timmerman L.A. Nolan G.P. Admon A. Crabtree G.R. Nature. 1994; 369: 497-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar) resulted in more than 90% inhibition of the induced activity of both the COX-2 and the IL-2 promoter (Fig. 4 A), supporting the hypothesis that NFAT was required in the regulation of COX-2gene expression in T cells. Because NFAT-dependent transcriptional activation of several promoters such as IL-2 requires the cooperation with AP-1 to efficiently drive transcription (37Rao A. Luo C. Hogan P.G. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 707-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (2227) Google Scholar, 40Cockerill P.N. Bert A.G. Jenkins F. Ryan G.R. Shannon M.F. Vadas M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2071-2079Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), we next examined the role of AP-1 in the regulation of COX-2 promoter activity. For this purpose we used a dominant negative mutant version of c-Jun named TAM67 that lacks the transactivation domain. In agreement with previous work (32Petrak D. Memon S.A. Birrer M.J. Ashwell J.D. Zacharchuk C.M. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 2046-2051PubMed Google Scholar), co-expression of TAM67 in T cells markedly inhibited the induction of IL-2 promoter by PMA plus Ion (Fig. 4 B). Similarly, cotransfection of the c-Jun dominant negative isoform in Jurkat cells along with the P2–274 reporter plasmid resulted in a clear suppression of COX-2 promoter inducibility by PMA plus Ion (Fig. 4 B). These data supported the hypothesis that AP-1 transcription factors played an important role in PMA plus Ion-mediated transcriptional induction of the human COX-2gene in T cells. To localize the minimal regions involved in the inducibility by PMA plus Ion of the COX-2 promoter, further 5′-deletions were created from the P2–274 construct (Fig.5 A). Deletion of a region of 83 bp generated the P2–192 construct, which displayed a reduced ability to be induced by PMA plus Ion both in Jurkat cells and PBTs. This induction was still abrogated with CsA treatment. However, a shorter construct (P2–150) could not be induced at all (Fig. 5,B and C). Thus, the regions between −170 to −88 and −88 to −46 might include sequences important for the CsA-sensitive induction of COX-2 promoter in T cells by PMA plus Ion. Sequence analysis of these regions revealed the presence of two putative NFAT cis-acting elements named COX-2 NFAT distal (COX-2 dNFAT) and COX-2 NFAT proximal (COX-2 pNFAT) elements. Both sequences contained the minimal GGAAA NFAT core consensus sequence. In addition, the COX-2 pNFAT element contained an adjacent AP-1-like site. Noteworthy, both regions were extremely conserved among human, rat, and mouse genomic sequences not only in nucleotide composition but also in their relative localization from the transcription start site (Fig.6).Figure 6Comparison of the −117/−87 and −82/−58 nucleotide sequences of the human COX-2 5′-flanking region with those of rat and mouse genes.

CSR occurs between switch (S) regions that precede each Ig heavy chain constant region gene. Various studies have demonstrated that transcription plays an essential role in CSR in vivo. In this study, we show that in vitro transcription of S regions in their physiological orientation induces the formation of stable R loops. Furthermore, we show that the nucleotide excision repair nucleases XPF-ERCC1 and XPG can cleave the R loops formed in the S regions. Based on these findings, we propose that CSR is initiated via a mechanism that involves transcription-dependent S region cleavage by DNA structure-specific endonucleases that function in general DNA repair processes.

The Ig variable regions are encoded by component V, (D), and J gene segments that are assembled into a complete variable region coding exon during precursor B cell differentiation by V(D)J recombination (for review, see Ref. 1Lansford R.

The murine Ig heavy chain locus contains 8 different constant region (CH) genes with the following organization: 5′-V(D)J–Cμ–Cδ–Cγ3–Cγ1–Cγ2b–Cγ2a–Cε–Cα-3′. Differentiating B lymphocytes first produce Ig μ heavy chains in association with Ig light chains as an IgM surface receptor. Upon activation, mature B cells can join the antigen-specific V(D)J gene to a different downstream effector CH gene by a recombination/deletion process termed class switch recombination (CSR)1 The CSR process results in switching from the expression of IgM to other classes of Ig molecules such as IgG, IgE, and IgA (for reviews, see Refs. 2Coffman R.L.

CSR is a process that is clearly distinct from the site-specific V(D)J recombination reaction. CSR occurs in regions composed of tandem repetitive sequences termed switch (S) regions that are located upstream of each CH gene that undergoes CSR. S regions range in size from 1 to 10 kilobases in length. Most CSR sites fall within or around the repetitive S region sequences (4Dunnick W. Hertz G.Z. Scappino L. Gritzmacher C.

Despite intensive investigation, the mechanism of CSR has remained elusive, although a wide range of models have been proposed (reviewed in Refs.1Lansford R. Okada A. Chen J. Oltz E.M. Blackwell K.

One significant clue, however, is the dependence of CSR on transcription. Germline CH genes are organized into transcription units in which transcription initiates from a promoter 5′ of an exon termed the I exon, runs through the S region, and undergoes polyadenylation downstream of the CH exon. CSR is always preceded by the activation of I promoters (germline transcription) (6Berton M.T. Uhr J.W. Vitetta E.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The precise role of germline CH gene transcription in CSR is still unknown. However, as the transcript does not contain long open reading frames, its function is likely mediated at the RNA level. Somein vitro studies have yielded evidence consistent with this hypothesis. It was found that transcribing S regions in vitro results in the association of S region containing transcripts with the template DNA as an RNA-DNA hybrid (15Daniels G.A. Lieber M.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 5006-5011Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 16Reaban M.E. Griffin J.A. Nature. 1990; 348: 342-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 17Reaban M.E. Lebowitz J. Griffin J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21850-21857Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The structure of this RNA-DNA complex is not known. Various models have been proposed, including triplex, G quartette, and collapsed R loop structures. In the context of an R loop structure, the switch transcript would hybridize with the template DNA strand, and the non-template strand would exist as single-stranded DNA. Theoretically, the R loop structure could mediate recombination by serving as a substrate for structure-specific endonucleases. In the context of an R loop, the junction of the single-stranded, non-template strand with the flanking duplex DNA could be cleaved by two nucleases that recognize duplex-single strand junctions: XPF-ERCC1 and XPG. The XPF-ERCC1 and XPG nucleases were identified on the basis of their roles in nucleotide excision repair (for reviews, see Ref.18Sancar A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 43-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (965) Google Scholar). Both can cleave bubble structures at the duplex-single strand junctions (19Bardwell A.J. Bardwell L. Tomkinson A.E.

However, these two nucleases recognize different sides of the loop-duplex junction. XPF-ERCC1 cleaves the 5′ side of the loop-duplex junction, while XPG cleaves the 3′ side. While it is unknown whether either of these nucleases can cleave an R loop, the potential strand breaks generated by such activity could serve to initiate subsequent recombination in S region. To test the potential role of transcription-dependent R loop structures in CSR, we carried out the following experiments. First, we transcribed S regions in vitro and used nuclease P1 to probe single-stranded regions in the resulting RNA-template complex. The P1 digest pattern is consistent with that of an R-loop. In addition, we showed that both the XPF-ERCC1 and the XPG proteins can cleave the single-stranded regions in the transcribed S region, clearly demonstrating that these structures can be recognized by generally expressed repair enzymes. Based on these results, we propose a novel model for CSR. The in vitro transcription vector (pT7) is derived from pET-15b (Novogen). pT7-Sμ(S) and Sμ(A) were generated by cloning a 3.7-kilobase HindIII fragment containing most of the repetitive DNA of Sμ into pT7 in either orientation. pT7-Sγ2b(S) and Sγ2b(A) were generated by cloning a 3.7-kilobase HincII/HindIII fragment containing most of the 49-base pair repeat of Sγ2b into pT7 in either orientation. pT7-lacZ(S) and -(A) were generated by cloning a 3.3-kilobase lacZ fragment into pT7 in either orientation. The plasmids were linearized with restriction enzymes immediately 3′ of the switch regions or the lacZ sequence for in vitro transcription. Probes in Southern analysis are 50-base oligonucleotides, which hybridize to the 5′ end of non-template strand or the 3′ end of the template strand, respectively. The probes are labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase. The R loop substrate was constructed by annealing two 60-base oligonucleotides and an in vitrotranscribed RNA. The sequences of the oligonucleotides are: non-template strand: 5′-GCGATCCAGAGGTTCACCTGTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTCCGTTGACCACGTGATTGGC-3′; template strand, 5′-GCCAATCACGTGGTCAACGGCTCACATTCCCACCATCCCCCAGGTGAACCTCTGGATCGC-3′. The sequence of the in vitro transcribed RNA is: 5′-GGGGGGGAGCTGGGGATGGTGGGAATGTGAGGGACCAGTCCTAGCAGCTATCCTCGA-3′. The oligonucleotides were labeled at the 5′ end with [γ-32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase. The oligonucleotides and the RNA were mixed in 40 mm Tris acetate (pH 8.0), 10 mm MgCl2. The mixture was heated to 95 °C for 5 min, and cooled to 40 °C over a period of 1 h. The R loop was purified by electrophoresis on an 8% polyacrylamide gel containing 40 mm Tris acetate (pH 8.0), 10 mm MgCl2. In vitro transcription reactions were carried out in 40 mm Tris-Cl (pH 8.0), 6 mm MgCl2, 10 mm DTT, 4 mm spermidine, 10 mm NaCl, 1 mm of each rNTP, 15 units of T7 RNA polymerase, 200 ng of plasmid in a volume of 20 μl. For experiments with XPF-ERCC1 and XPG, 100 ng of plasmid was used in the reaction. The reaction was incubated at 37 °C for 15 min, and stopped by the addition of EDTA to 25 mm final concentration. The DNA and RNA were purified by phenol:chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. The reaction was carried out in 50 mm Tric-Cl (pH 8.0), 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm DTT, 10 units of RNase inhibitor, 5 units of RNase H in a volume of 20 μl. The reaction was incubated at 37 °C for 30 min, and stopped by the addition of EDTA to 25 mm final concentration. The DNA and RNA were purified by phenol:chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. The reaction was carried out in 50 mm sodium acetate (pH 5.5), 200 mmNaCl, 1 mm ZnSO4, 25 ng of DNA. The amount of P1 used ranged from 10 to 105 pg/20-μl reaction as indicated in the figures. The reaction was incubated at 37 °C for 15 min and stopped by the addition of 2 μl of 0.5m Tris-Cl (pH 8.5), 50 mm EDTA. 2 μg of RNase A was added to each reaction, and the reaction was incubated for 15 min. The DNA was purified by phenol:chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. Denaturation was achieved by incubating the DNA at 50 °C for 1 h in 50% dimethyl sulfoxide, 1 mglyoxal, 10 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.0), 0.5 mm EDTA, 1 μg of sonicated samon sperm DNA. The denatured DNA was electrophoresed in 1% agarose gels containing 10 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.0), 0.5 mm EDTA. After electrophoresis, the DNA was transferred to a nylon membrane, and detected by Southern hybridization. The P1 digest pattern of the model R loop substrate was analyzed by electrophoresing the cleavage products on a 10% denaturing polyacrylamide gel in 90 mm Tris borate (pH 8.0), 2 mm EDTA. Human ERCC1 (hERCC1) was cloned by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction from HeLa cell cDNA. Human XPF (hXPF) was cloned by polymerase chain reaction from a baculovirus expressing hXPF (kindly provided by Drs. Sancar and Bessho). A 6 × histidine tag was introduced at the C terminus of hXPF during the polymerase chain reaction. Mouse XPG (mXPG) was cloned by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction from lipopolysaccharide-stimulated spleen cDNA. A 6 × histidine tag was introduced at the C terminus of mXPG. The cDNAs for hXPF and hERCC1 were cloned into pVL941 vector (Pharmigen), and recombinant baculoviruses were generated using the BaculoGold Kit. The cDNA for mXPG was cloned into pJVP10Z vector, and recombinant baculoviruses were generated by co-transfection with wild-type baculovirus DNA. The recombinant virus was purified according to procedures provided by the manufacture (Pharmigen). XPF-ERCC1 was purified from Sf9 cells co-infected with the two recombinant viruses. Cells were harvested 48 h after infection. All the purification steps were carried out at 4 °C. The infected cells were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline. The cells were resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.0), 500 mm NaCl) plus mixtures of protease inhibitors. The cells were lysed by sonication. The lysate was centrifuged at 20,000 rpm in a SW50 rotor for 30 min. The supernatant was loaded onto a Ni2+ affinity column equilibrated in lysis buffer. The column was washed with lysis buffer. Elution was achieved with a gradient of 0–250 mm imidazole in lysis buffer. Fractions containing XPF-ERCC1 were pooled and dialyzed overnight against 20 mm Tris-Cl (pH 8.0), 100 mm NaCl. The dialyzed sample was centrifuged at 8,000 rpm in a HB-6 rotor for 15 min. The supernatant was loaded onto a S-Sepharose column equilibrated with 20 mm Tris-Cl, 100 mm NaCl. The proteins were eluted with a NaCl gradient from 100 to 500 mm in 20 mm Tris-Cl (pH 8.0). Fractions containing XPF-ERCC1 were pooled and dialyzed against 50 mm Tris-Cl (pH 8.0), 0.5 mm DTT, 20% glycerol. Protein concentration was determined by the Bradford assay using bovine serum albumin as a standard. The purity of the protein was checked by electrophoresing on a 10% SDS-PAGE. For purification of XPG, infection and lysis were carried out the same way as with XPF-ERCC1. The cleared lysate was loaded onto a Ni2+ affinity column equilibrated with the lysis buffer. The column was washed sequentially with lysis buffer and lysis buffer plus 25 mm imidazole. Proteins were eluted with an imidazole gradient from 25 to 225 mm in lysis buffer. Fractions containing XPG were pooled and loaded onto a hydroxyapatite column equilibrated in the lysis buffer. The column was washed sequentially with lysis buffer and 20 mm Tris-Cl (pH 8.0), 100 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA. Proteins were eluted with a gradient of potassium phosphate (pH 7.0) from 0 to 500 mm. The peak fractions containing XPG was pooled and dialyzed against 50 mm Tris-Cl (pH 8.0), 0.5 mmDTT, 20% glycerol. Protein concentration was determined by the Bradford assay using bovine serum albumin as a standard. The purity of the protein was checked by electrophoresing on a 8% SDS-PAGE. The reaction was carried out in 50 mm Tris-Cl (pH 8.0), 5 mmMgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 13 ng of DNA, 80 ng of XPF-ERCC1 or 45 ng of XPG or both in a volume of 20 μl. For comparison between untranscribed and transcribed switch regions, in vitro transcribed RNA was added to the untranscribed DNA. For this purpose, a separate in vitrotranscription reaction of the same template was set up. After 15 min of in vitro transcription reaction, the template was degraded by the addition of DNase I. After 15 min of DNase I digest, the DNase I was eliminated by the addition of SDS to 0.5% and 20 μg of proteinase K. The reaction was incubated for 30 min, and the RNA was purified by phenol:chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. The RNA was mixed with the untranscribed DNA. The amount of RNA is equivalent to that generated in a transcription reaction containing 13 ng of DNA template. For cleavage of model R loop substrate, 16 ng of XPF-ERCC1 proteins or 9 ng of XPG protein or both were added per reaction. The cleavage reaction was incubated at 37 °C for 1 h, and was stopped by the addition of EDTA to 25 mm final concentration. 2 μg of RNase A was added, and the incubation was continued at 37 °C for 15 min. Then, SDS was added to 0.5% final concentrations, and 20 μg of proteinase K was added. The digest was incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. The DNA was purified by phenol:chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. The DNA was analyzed the same way as in P1 digest reactions. To determine whether transcription induces R loop formation in S regions, we generated constructs that allow the transcription of S regions (Sμ or Sγ2b) in vitro by T7 RNA polymerase. We chose to test Sμ and Sγ2b because they represent the two different types of S region families. Sμ, Sα, and Sε are characterized by pentameric repeats, while Sγ1, Sγ2a, Sγ2b, and Sγ3 are composed of 49-base pair repeats (28Davis M.M. Kim S.K. Hood L.E.

If the same result is obtained with both types of S regions, it may reflect a property of S regions in general. The plasmids were linearized immediately after the S regions, and transcribed with T7 RNA polymerase. After transcription, the DNA was treated with nuclease P1 that specifically cleaves single-stranded DNA (Fig. 1). To better compare P1 sensitivity under different conditions, we varied the concentration of P1 over a range of 104. The digested DNA was denatured by glyoxal, electrophoresed on an agarose gel, and transferred to a nylon membrane. The P1 digest pattern on either strand of the template was then revealed by hybridizing with an oligonucleotide complementary to each DNA strand. The untranscribed Sμ DNA template was completely resistant to P1, with no cleavage detectable even at the highest P1 concentration tested (Fig. 1 A). In contrast, the non-template strand of Sμ was highly sensitive to P1after transcription (Fig. 1 A). Thus, the relative proportion of full-length DNA decreased with increasing concentration of P1, with the majority of full-length DNA being degraded in the presence of 103 pg of P1 per reaction. The template strand of Sμ was also cleaved by P1 in a transcription-dependent manner (Fig.1 A). However, cleavage was observed only at much higher concentrations of P1 (from 103 to 105 pg of P1/reaction), and the extent of degradation is less compared with that of the non-template strand. This difference indicates that the template strand contains less single-stranded regions compared with the non-template strand. Essentially identical results were obtained with the Sγ2b template (Fig. 1 B). The location of P1 cleavage sites can be determined by the size of the cleavage product. As the probe employed hybridizes to the 5′ end of the non-template strand; the size of cleavage product corresponds to the distance of the cleavage site to the 5′ end of the strand (Fig. 1, A and B). Based on this, cleavage occurred exclusively within the switch region. At the lowest P1 concentration (10 pg/reaction), the cleavage sites distributed relatively evenly in the S region, suggesting that single-stranded regions exist throughout the transcribed Sμ. When the concentration of P1 was increased (from 102 to 105 pg/reaction), the sizes of the cleavage product shift toward 5.7 kilobases, the location of the transcription initiation site. The digest pattern remained constant from P1concentrations of 103 to 105 pg/reaction, suggesting that all the single-stranded DNAs have been degraded at this concentration range; and the cleavage sites correspond to the 5′ boundary of the single-stranded regions. Thus, the single-stranded regions started mostly in the 5′ region of Sμ, close to the transcription initiation site. Similar to the non-template strand, cleavage of the template strand occurred exclusively in the switch region (Fig. 1 A). Again, the same results were observed with the Sγ2b template (Fig. 1 B). The large extent of single-stranded regions on the non-template strand is consistent with an R loop structure, which should be eliminated by RNase H degradation of the RNA hybridized to the template strand. To test this, we treated the transcribed switch regions with RNase H before P1 digest. Consistent with the expectation, RNase H eliminated most of the P1-sensitive regions in Sμ (Fig.1 C). In these experiments, a small amount of single-stranded DNA did remain. One explanation for the latter finding is that some of the single-stranded DNA on the non-template strand forms stable secondary structures, and cannot reanneal with the template strand after the RNA is eliminated by RNase H. If this explanation is true, then similar patterns of single-stranded DNA should exist on the template strand. This was indeed observed on the template strand (Fig.1 C). For the Sγ2b template, RNase H treatment completely eliminated single-stranded regions from either strand (Fig.1 D). In the experiments described above, the existence of RNA-DNA hybrids and the large amount of single-stranded DNA on the non-template strand are consistent with an R loop structure. However, the detection of short single-stranded regions on the template strand was unexpected, since the template strand should exist as an RNA-DNA duplex and be resistant to P1. One possibility is that the P1sensitivity is due to the distortion of duplex structure at the junction of the putative R loop with flanking DNA. We tested this possibility by analyzing the P1 digest pattern of a model R loop (Fig. 2). The model R loop was constructed from oligonucleotides and an in vitrotranscribed RNA. It consists of 20-base pair DNA duplexes on both sides and an R loop of 20 bases in the middle. The RNA forms a 20-base pair RNA-DNA hybrid on one oligonucleotide, with single-stranded extensions of 11 and 26 bases at the 5′ and 3′ end, respectively. The single-stranded extensions are designed to mimic the R loop formed during transcription, since the transcript may not hybridize with the template strand throughout its entire length. The oligonucleotide containing the single-stranded loop represents the non-template strand, while the oligonucleotide hybridized to the RNA represents the template strand. The R loop was labeled at the 5′ end on either DNA strand. Therefore, the size of the cleavage product corresponds to the distance of the cleavage site to the 5′ end of the strand. We digested the model R loop with P1, and electrophoresed the product on a denaturing polyacrylamide gel. We found that the non-template strand was highly sensitive to P1 (Fig. 2). At low P1 concentration (100 pg/reaction), the cleavage sites are distributed through out the loop from bases 21 to 38. The bases at the R loop-duplex junction are cleaved inefficiently at this low P1 concentration, probably due to steric hindrance. With increasing P1 concentration (104 to 105 pg/reaction), the cleavage sites shift toward the 5′ end of the loop, and extend into the flanking duplex regions. This result suggests that the duplex flanking the R loop is distorted, and shows some single-stranded character. Similarly, the R loop-duplex junction on the template strand is also sensitive to P1digest, but the extent of digestion of this strand was substantially less compared with that of the non-template strand (Fig. 2). Thus, the P1 digest pattern of the model R loop is similar to that of the transcribed switch regions, and suggests that the RNA-DNA complex in the transcribed switch region is an R loop. Previous studies showed that RNA-DNA hybrids are formed only when the S regions are transcribed in the physiological orientation (15Daniels G.A. Lieber M.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 5006-5011Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 16Reaban M.E. Griffin J.A. Nature. 1990; 348: 342-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 17Reaban M.E. Lebowitz J. Griffin J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21850-21857Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To compare R loop formation between different templates in our system, we did P1 analysis on either S region or a fragment of the lacZ gene transcribed in either the physiological or reverse orientation (Fig. 3, A, B, and C). S regions transcribed in the reverse orientation (Sμ(A) and Sγ2b(A)) were significantly more resistant to P1 digest when compared with S regions transcribed in the physiological orientation (Sμ(S) and Sγ2b(S)). Even at the highest P1 concentration used, most of the template DNA remained intact (Fig. 3, A and B). Similarly, the transcribed lacZ DNA, in either orientation, was significantly more resistant to P1 digests than the switch regions (Fig. 3 C). These data show that stable R loop formation is most efficient in S regions transcribed in the physiological orientation. To test whether XPF-ERCC1 and XPG can cleave the R-loops formed in transcribed S regions, we employed proteins purified from recombinant baculoviruses that overproduce XPF-ERCC1 or XPG (Fig.4 A). We first tested the activity of the recombinant proteins with the model R loop as a substrate (Fig. 4 B). XPF-ERCC1 cleaves the 5′ R loop-duplex junctions in both strands at positions a few bases into the duplex region, consistent with the known activities of the enzyme (21de Laat W.L. Appeldoorn E.

The efficiency of cleavage on the template strand is similar to that on the non-template strand. This result suggests that XPF-ERCC1 activity requires only short single-stranded regions. XPG cleaves the 3′ R loop-duplex junction on the non-template strand, but did not cleave the template strand. Thus, XPG may require longer single-stranded regions for function. Alternatively, the 3′ junction may have less single-stranded character due to sequence effects. In P1 digests of the model R-loop, the 3′ junction on the template strand is indeed less sensitive to P1 than the 5′ junction (Fig. 2). Addition of both XPF-ERCC1 and XPG to the reaction resulted in a slight inhibition of cleavage for both proteins on the non-template strand. This inhibition may result from the small size of the R loop, which cannot accommodate both nucleases. On the template strand, XPG induces a new minor cleavage site, probably due to structural changes of the R loop induced by the binding of XPG. Thus, our recombinant XPF-ERCC1 an"

After release from p21-induced growth arrest, cells re-entered the cell cycle but displayed growth retardation, cell death and decreased clonogenicity. The failure to form colonies was associated with abnormal mitosis and endoreduplication in the recovering cells and was correlated with the induced level of p21 and the duration of p21 induction. p21 induction was found to inhibit the expression of multiple proteins involved in the execution and control of mitosis. p21-induced depletion of the cellular pools of mitosis-control proteins was followed by asynchronous resynthesis of such proteins after release from p21, which explains the observed mitotic abnormalities. Genetic destabilization in cells recovering from p21-induced growth arrest may conceivably play a role in carcinogenesis and tumor progression."

https://openalex.org/W2312853461,"Members of the STAT family of transcriptional regulators modulate the expression of a variety of gene products that promote cell proliferation, survival and transformation. Although initially identified as mediators of cytokine signaling, the STAT proteins are also activated by, and thus may contribute to the actions of, polypeptide growth factors. To define the mechanism by which these factors activate STATs, we examined the process of Stat3 activation in Balb/c-3T3 fibroblasts treated with platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF). As STATs are activated by tyrosine phosphorylation, and as PDGF receptors are ligand-activated tyrosine kinases, we considered the possibility that Stat3 interacts with and is phosphorylated by PDGF receptors. We find that Stat3 associates with PDGF beta receptors in both the presence and, surprisingly, the absence of PDGF. Moreover, Stat3 was phosphorylated on tyrosine in PDGF beta receptor immunoprecipitates of PDGF-treated but not untreated cells. Although required, receptor activation was insufficient for Stat3 activation. When added to cells in combination with a pharmacologic agent (PD180970) that specifically inhibits the activity of Src family tyrosine kinases, PDGF did not activate Stat3 as monitored by electrophoretic mobility shift assay. PD180970 did not affect MAPK activation by PDGF or the JAK-dependent activation of Stat3 by interleukin-6. The necessity of Src activity for Stat3 activation by PDGF was further evidenced by data showing the presence of Src in complexes containing both Stat3 and PDGF beta receptors in PDGF-treated cells. These results suggest a novel mechanism of STAT activation in which inactive Stat3 pre-assembles with inactive PDGF receptors, and in response to ligand binding and in a manner dependent on Src kinase activity, is rapidly phosphorylated and activated. Additional data demonstrate that Src kinase activity is also required for PDGF stimulation of DNA synthesis in density-arrested cells."

This gene, which we refer to asRTBP1 (rice telomere-binding protein 1), encodes a polypeptide with a predicted molecular mass of 70 kDa. RTBP1 is ubiquitously expressed in various organs and binds DNA with two or more duplex TTTAGGG repeats. The predicted protein sequence includes a single domain at the C terminus with extensive homology to Myb-like DNA binding motif. The Myb-like domain of RTBP1 is very closely related to that of other telomere-binding proteins, including TRF1, TRF2, Taz1p, and Tbf1p, indicating that DNA-binding domains of telomere-binding proteins are well conserved among evolutionarily distant species. To obtain precise information on the sequence of the DNA binding site recognized by RTBP1, we analyzed the sequence-specific binding properties of the isolated Myb-like domain of RTBP1. The isolated Myb-like domain was capable of sequence-specific DNA binding as a homodimer. Gel retardation analysis with a series of mutated telomere probes revealed that the internal GGGTTT sequence in the two-telomere repeats is critical for binding of Myb-like domain of RTBP1, which is consistent with the model of the TRF1·DNA complex showing that base-specific contacts are made within the sequence GGGTTA. To the best of our knowledge, RTBP1 is the first cloned gene in which the product is able to bind double-stranded telomeric DNA in plants.

Nature. 1991; 350: 569-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (3079) Google Scholar, 2Greider C.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 337-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (909) Google Scholar). Telomeres in most eukaryotes are composed of tandem repeats of short sequence elements, typically 5 to 8 base pairs in length (3Zakian V.A. Science. 1995; 270: 1601-1606Crossref PubMed Scopus (795) Google Scholar). These repeated sequences are usually rich in G residues on the strand oriented in the 5′ to 3′ direction toward the end of the chromosome. The G-rich strand is extended beyond the complementary C-rich strand and terminates as a single-stranded 3′ overhang in several evolutionarily divergent organisms (4Makarov V.L. Hirose Y. Langmore J.P. Cell. 1997; 88: 657-666Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (764) Google Scholar, 5Wright W.E. Tesmer V.M. Huffman K.E. Levene S.D. Shay J.W. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2810-2821Crossref PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar). Recently, it has been shown that the long stretch of mammalian double-stranded telomere DNA bends back on itself, forming a large telomere loop (t-loop), and the 3′ G-rich single-stranded overhang at the end of the t-loop invades the double-stranded telomere and produces a displacement loop (d-loop) (6Greider C.W.

Cell. 1999; 97: 503-514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1946) Google Scholar). These t-loops are proposed to mask telomere termini from cellular activities that can act on DNA ends. The integrity and proper functioning of telomeres seem to be achieved via associations between the telomere repeat sequences and specific binding proteins. Studies of telomere chromatin structure have suggested that telomeres may be packaged into specialized nucleoprotein complexes. Some proteins specifically interact with the single-stranded 3′ extension at the extreme termini, which are essential for chromosome capping and telomerase regulation (8Cardenas M.E.

The other group of telomere-binding proteins binds specifically to the double-stranded telomeric repeats. The most well characterized proteins include Rap1p, identified from Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Rap1p, in addition to binding to telomeric repeat sequences and performing important functions in telomere length maintenance (11Lustig A.J. Kurtz S. Shore D. Science. 1990; 250: 549-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar, 12Sussel L. Shore D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Taz1p in Schizosaccharomyces pombe, found in a one-hybrid screen using S. pombe telomeric DNA as a target (13Cooper J.P. Nimmo E.R. Allshire R.C. Cech T.R. Nature. 1997; 385: 744-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar), is involved in telomere length regulation, repression of telomere adjacent genes, and the interactions between telomeres and the spindle pole body during the meiotic prophase (14Cooper J.P. Watanabe Y. Nurse P. Nature. 1998; 392: 828-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar, 15Nimmo E.R. Pidoux A.L. Perry P.E. Allshire R.C. Nature. 1998; 392: 825-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). In mammalian cells, two double-stranded telomere-binding proteins have been identified (16Broccoli D. Smogorzewska A. Chong L. de Lange T. Nat. Genet. 1997; 17: 231-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (762) Google Scholar). The binding of TRF1 controls telomere length by inhibiting the action of telomerase (17van Steensel B. de Lange T. Nature. 1997; 385: 740-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (1055) Google Scholar). TRF2 plays a key role in the protection of chromosome ends from end-to-end fusion (18van Steensel B. Smogorzewska A. de Lange T. Cell. 1998; 92: 401-413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1456) Google Scholar). Despite the apparently conserved function, telomere-binding proteins show a limited amino acid sequence similarity. However, they share a domain that resembles the DNA binding motif present in the vertebrate c-Myb family of transcriptional activators (19Bilaud T. Koering C.E. Binet-Brasselet E. Ancelin K.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 1731-1740Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Interestingly, whereas the DNA binding domain of the Myb proteins typically consists of three tandem repeats of the Myb motif (21Tanikawa J. Yasukawa T. Enari M. Ogata K. Nishimura Y. Ishii S. Sarai A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9320-9324Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), Rap1p contains two Myb-like domains that bind DNA in a tandem orientation (22Konig P. Giraldo R. Chapman L Rhodes D. Cell. 1996; 85: 125-136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). In contrast, the DNA binding domains of TRF1, TRF2, and Taz1p contain only a single Myb-like domain at their C terminus (16Broccoli D. Smogorzewska A. Chong L. de Lange T. Nat. Genet. 1997; 17: 231-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (762) Google Scholar, 23Spink K.G. Evans R.J. Chambers A.

Recently, it has been shown that the isolated Myb-like domain of TRF1 binds specifically and with significant affinity to telomeric DNA as a monomer (20Konig P. Fairall L. Rhodes D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 1731-1740Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Although with less specificity than the full-length dimer, the isolated Myb-like domain of Taz1p was also capable of sequence-specific DNA binding (23Spink K.G. Evans R.J. Chambers A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 527-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 24Vassetzky N.S. Gaden F. Brun C. Gasser S.M. Gilson E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 4687-4694Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Taken together, these results indicate that the Myb-like domain is indeed responsible for specific telomeric DNA recognition. Telomere structure in most plants is very similar to that of other eukaryotes. The plant telomeric DNA sequence (TTTAGGG)n was first characterized in Arabidopsis thaliana (25Richards E.J. Ausubel F.M. Cell. 1988; 53: 127-136Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar) and was subsequently cloned in several different species (26Kilian A. Kleinhofs A. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1992; 235: 153-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 27Wu K.S. Tanksley S.D. Plant Mol. Biol. 1993; 22: 861-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 28Ganal M.W. Lapitan N.L. Tanksley S.D. Plant Cell. 1991; 3: 87-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Compared with the extensive research done in other eukaryotes, many fewer studies of plant telomere-binding proteins have been reported to date. Protein binding to double-stranded telomeric DNA has been found in maize and Arabidopsis cellular extracts (29Regad F. Lebas M. Lescure B. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 239: 163-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 30Zentgraf U. Plant Mol. Biol. 1995; 27: 467-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Previously, we identified and characterized protein factors that specifically bind to the single-stranded G-rich telomeric repeats in rice and mung bean nuclear extracts (31Kim J.H. Kim W.T. Chung I.K. Plant Mol. Biol. 1998; 36: 661-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 32Lee J.H. Kim J.H. Kim W.T. Kang B.G. Chung I.K. Plant Mol. Biol. 2000; 42: 547-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). However, nothing is known about the physiological role of telomere-binding proteins in plants. We report here the molecular cloning and characterization of a rice gene encoding a double-stranded telomere-binding protein, designated RTBP1.1 The predicted protein sequence includes a single Myb-like domain at the C terminus. The Myb-like domain of RTBP1 is very closely related to other telomeric proteins, indicating that DNA binding domains of telomere-binding proteins are well conserved among evolutionarily distant species. The isolated Myb-like domain of RTBP1 is capable of sequence-specific DNA binding as a homodimer and recognizes a binding site centered on the sequence GGGTTT. To the best of our knowledge, RTBP1 is the first cloned gene in which the product is able to bind specifically double-stranded telomeric DNA in plants. Because the Myb-like domain appears to be a significant motif for a large class of proteins that bind the duplex telomeric DNA, RTBP1 may play important roles in plant telomere function in vivo. In the BLAST search for proteins homologous to the Myb repeat, several open reading frames containing a single Myb repeat were found (19Bilaud T. Koering C.E. Binet-Brasselet E. Ancelin K. Pollice A. Gasser S.M. Gilson E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 1294-1303Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). This analysis includes orfR1 from a partial cDNA sequence of rice (GenBankTM accession no. D23805). Two primers (5′-GGAGGCCTTTCACTGTTGCTGAAG-3 and 5′-CCTGTTAACGAACCAACAGTAGGA-3′) were designed to clone orfR1 cDNA. After PCR amplification using the DNA of a rice seedling cDNA library, a product of the expected size (459 base pair fragment) was obtained. To clone the full-length cDNA, the λ Zap II library of rice seedling cDNA was screened using the 459-base pair PCR product as a probe. The full-length cDNA insert containing putative RTBP1 was subcloned into the Bluescript SK plasmid to create pBS-RTBP1 by in vivoexcision of pBluescript from the Zap II vector (Stratagene). The full-length RTBP1 cDNA was PCR-amplified from a pBS-RTBP1 using a set of primers incorporating novelBamHI (at the 5′-end of the upstream primer) and HindIII (at the 5′-end of the downstream primer) sites for ease of cloning. The resulting PCR product was cut with BamHI and HindIII and cloned into the corresponding sites in plasmid pGEX-KG (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in order to fuse GST and RTBP1 in frame. To obtain the Myb-like domain of RTBP1, residues 446–633 and 506–615 of RTBP1 were PCR-amplified from a pBS-RTBP1. Primers compatible with cloning into the BamHI and HindIII restriction sites of pGEX-KG were used, and the sequence of the resulting plasmids was confirmed by the dideoxy sequencing method. The fusion protein GST-RTBP1 was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 cells by adding 0.1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and purified on glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Correct synthesis was checked by loading the cells directly on SDS-polyacrylamide electrophoresis gels and staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. GST protein itself was produced from bacteria carrying an empty pGEX-KG vector. The final protein preparation was dialyzed against TNE buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol), and stored at −80 °C. Rice genomic DNA was prepared from leaves as described by Murray and Thompson (33Murray M.G. Thompson W.F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1980; 8: 4321-4325Crossref PubMed Scopus (9497) Google Scholar) and digested with various restriction endonucleases. Digested genomic DNA was separated by electrophoresis in an 0.8% agarose gel and blotted on a Hybond N+ membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Probes were labeled with [α-32P]dCTP using a random-primer kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and blots were hybridized with an internal fragment of RTBP1 cDNA. For Northern blot analysis, total RNA was isolated from roots, coleoptiles, leaves, and stems according to the manufacturer's instructions (TRIzol reagent, Life Technologies, Inc.). Twenty mg of total RNA was fractionated by 1%, 2.2m formaldehyde gel electrophoresis and blotted onto a Hybond N+ membrane. Blots were hybridized with an internal fragment of RTBP1 cDNA. To check for equal loading, blots were rehybridized with a 0.9-kilobase pair cDNA fragment of 18 S rRNA. DNA probes and competitors for gel retardation assays are described in Table I. To reduce nonspecific DNA-protein binding, purified RTBP1 was preincubated with 0.5 μg of poly(dI-dC) and 0.5 μg of nonspecific DNA oligonucleotide in 20 μl of a binding buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 50 mmNaCl, and 5% glycerol) for 10 min on ice. End-labeled DNA probe (0.25 ng) was then added to the reaction mixtures. After incubation for 10 min on ice, the mixtures were loaded on an 8% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel. Incubation for 10 min at room temperature gave similar gel retardation results. Before loading, gels were prerun at 10 V/cm for 30 min, and electrophoresis was in 0.5× TBE (54 mm Tris borate, pH 8.3, 1 mm EDTA) for 2.5 h after loading the samples. For the competition experiments, varying amounts of cold competitor molecules were preincubated with nuclear extract before the addition of labeled probe. Binding activity was quantified with a Fuji phosphorimager.Table IOligonucleotide probes and competitorsOligonucleotideSequenceRTR-15′TTTAGGG3′AAATCCCRTR-25′TTTAGGGTTTAGGG3′AAATCCCAAATCCCRTR-35′TTTAGGGTTTAGGGTTTAGGG3′AAATCCCAAATCCCAAATCCCRTR-45′TTTAGGGTTTAGGGTTTAGGGTTTAGGG3′AAATCCCAAATCCCAAATCCCAAATCCCHTR-45′TTAGGGTTAGGGTTAGGGTTAGGG3′AATCCCAATCCCAATCCCAATCCCCTR-45′TTTAGGCTTTAGGCTTTAGGCTTTAGGC3′AAATCCGAAATCCGAAATCCGAAATCCGRTR-4G5′TTTAGGGTTTAGGGTTTAGGGTTTAGGGRTR-4C5′CCCTAAACCCTAAACCCTAAACCCTAAANS1-aNS, nonspecific DNA.5′AGAGATTGCCTGACGTCAGAGAGCTAG3′TCTCTAACGGACTGCAGTCTCTCGATC1-a NS, nonspecific DNA. Open table in a new tab For DNase I footprinting analysis, the two-telomere repeat oligonucleotide RTR-2 was cloned into the end-filled XbaI of pBend4. The resulting plasmid was digested with XhoI and radioactively labeled by filling using [α-32P]dCTPs and Klenow polymerase. To excise the fragment containing the two-telomere repeat, the 3′-end-labeled fragments were then digested with NheI (for end labeling of the G-rich strand) or EcoRV (for end labeling of the C-rich strand) and were then gel-purified. Binding reactions contained 1 ng of end-labeled fragment, specified amounts of the purified RTBP1-(446–633), 0.5 μg of poly(dI-dC), and 0.5 μg of nonspecific oligonucleotide in a total of 20 μl of binding buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 50 mm NaCl, and 5% glycerol). After incubation for 10 min on ice, DNase I digestions were initiated by adding 1 μl of 40 mm CaCl2 and 1 μl of 50 μg/ml DNase I. Reactions were terminated after 60 s by the addition of 2 μl of 0.5 m EDTA. Samples were ethanol-precipitated, suspended in sequencing gel loading buffer, and then analyzed on an 8% sequencing gel. The computer search for proteins homologous to the Myb-related motif revealed several open reading frames derived from partial cDNA sequences that contain a single Myb repeat (19Bilaud T. Koering C.E. Binet-Brasselet E. Ancelin K. Pollice A. Gasser S.M. Gilson E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 1294-1303Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). This analysis includes five proteins from plants, the maize Shrunkeninitiator-binding protein IBP1 (34Lugert T. Werr W. Plant Mol. Biol. 1994; 25: 493-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), the parsley BoxP binding factor BPF1 (35da Costa e Shilva O. Klein L. Typermelzer E. Trezzini G.F. Hahlbrock K. Plant J. 1993; 4: 125-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), two open reading frames from rice (orfR1 and orfR2), and one open reading frame from A. thaliana (orfA) (19Bilaud T. Koering C.E. Binet-Brasselet E. Ancelin K. Pollice A. Gasser S.M. Gilson E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 1294-1303Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). To characterize a rice protein derived from partial cDNA sequence (orfR1), we isolated the full-length rice cDNA representing RTBP1 using a combination of polymerase chain reaction and hybridization strategies. The DNA sequence of the RTBP1 cDNA was determined to be 2031 base pair long. Conceptual translation of the full-length RTBP1 cDNA revealed one long open reading frame encoding a protein of 633 amino acids, with a predicted molecular mass of 70 kDa and a pI of 8.91 (Fig.1 A). The C-terminal region of the protein contains a 55-amino acid stretch of homology with the Myb-related motif from the other telomere-binding proteins such as TRF1, Taz1p, and Tbf1p (13Cooper J.P. Nimmo E.R. Allshire R.C. Cech T.R. Nature. 1997; 385: 744-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar, 16Broccoli D. Smogorzewska A. Chong L. de Lange T. Nat. Genet. 1997; 17: 231-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (762) Google Scholar, 36Brigati C. Kurtz S. Balderes D. Vidali G. Shore D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1306-1314Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1 B). This presumed helix-turn-helix motif is known as the ”telobox“ because it is found in other proteins that bind telomeric DNA sequences (19Bilaud T. Koering C.E. Binet-Brasselet E. Ancelin K. Pollice A. Gasser S.M. Gilson E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 1294-1303Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Alignment of the predicted sequences of RTBP1 and TRF1 revealed the strong conservation in their C-terminal Myb-like domains (31% sequence identity) (Fig. 1 C). Outside of the Myb-like domain, RTBP1 does not have any more homology with TRF1 than with randomly chosen proteins. Southern blot analysis of rice genomic DNA was performed to determine the number of genomic DNA fragments with homology to the RTBP1 cDNA. Genomic DNA digested with various restriction enzymes produced only one strongly hybridized band in each digest (Fig. 2 A). No additional fragment was visible in any of the digests, even with low stringency hybridization (data not shown). These results suggest that a single-copy gene encoding RTBP1 cDNA is present in the rice genome. Transcripts that hybridized to RTBP1 cDNA were detected on Northern blots of rice poly(A)+-enriched RNA and total RNA from various organs of rice plant. A band of ∼2.3 kilobase pairs hybridized to RTBP1 cDNA in the poly(A)+-enriched lane (Fig. 2 B). A predicted molecular mass of 70 kDa of the RTBP1 coding region is consistent with the anticipated size of the gene based on the Northern blot analysis. The mRNA encoding RTBP1 was also detected in all organs of rice plants, with higher levels in root, leaf, and stem but lower levels in coleoptile, indicating that RTBP1 is ubiquitously expressed (Fig. 2 B). To test whether RTBP1 binds to telomeric DNA, the full-length RTBP1 was used in a gel retardation assay with a labeled RTR-4 (see TableI) containing four plant telomeric DNA repeats. RTBP1 gave rise to a discrete DNA·protein complex that migrated more slowly than the free probe (Fig.3A, lanes 2 and 3). Intensities of shifting bands increased upon the addition of increasing amounts of RTBP1. Competition binding experiments showed that a 50-fold excess of cold RTR-4 is enough to displace the labeled probe (lane 5), whereas the same excess molar amounts of unrelated nonspecific cold competitor did not compete at all (lane 7), indicating that RTBP1 is a specific telomeric DNA-binding protein. The C-terminal Myb-like domain of RTBP1 shares 31% amino acid sequence identity with that of TRF1, and the isolated Myb-like domain of TRF1 binds specifically to telomeric DNA (20Konig P. Fairall L. Rhodes D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 1731-1740Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). This prompted us to determine whether the isolated Myb-like domain of RTBP1 is responsible for the DNA binding specificity. Thus, we expressed the C-terminal region of RTBP1 comprising the Myb-like domain between positions 466 and 633 as a fusion protein with GST. Gel retardation assay revealed a RTR-4 probe binding activity in the bacterial extracts of cells induced for the expression of GST-RTBP1-(466–633) (Fig. 3 B, lane 13), whereas no activity was detected in extracts induced for GST alone (lane 12). GST-RTBP1-(466–633) was digested with thrombin to isolate the C-terminal region containing the entire Myb domain, and its DNA binding property was examined. This fragment of RTBP1 was found to produce three specific complexes, and intensities of slower migrating complexes increased upon the addition of increased amounts of RTBP1-(466–633) (lanes 2–5). These complexes were competed with the cold RTR-4 (lanes 6–8) but not with the unrelated nonspecific cold competitor (NS, lanes 9–11), similar to full-length RTBP1. It is worth noting that the band intensities of complexes 2 and 3 decreased more readily than that of complex 1 with increasing amounts of competitor (lanes 6–8), suggesting that RTBP1-(466–633) binds as a homo-multimer to the four-telomere repeat site. The faint bands migrating slower than complex 3 resulted from undigested GST fusion proteins (lanes 5, 9, 10). When the human and Caenorhabditis eleganstelomeric repeats were substituted for the plant telomeric repeats as competitors, HTR-4 and CTR-4 competed less effectively than their plant counterpart for the activity that binds the labeled RTR-4 (Fig.3 C, lanes 3–11). Again, higher order complexes (2 and 3) were competed more readily than complex 1. G-rich and C-rich single-stranded DNA (RTR-4G and RTR-4C, see Table I) did not compete for the interaction of RTBP1-(466–633) with RTR-4 (lanes 12–15). In conclusion, the Myb-like domain of RTBP1 is sufficient to confer specific interactions with plant double-stranded telomeric DNA. Because RTBP1-(466–633) produced three specific complexes for binding to RTR-4, the gel retardation analysis was repeated using a shorter DNA site containing one to three copies of the TTTAGGG repeat to determine the minimal number of telomeric repeats for DNA binding. As shown in Fig.4 A, RTBP1-(466–633) formed a single-shifted complex with the two-repeat sequence (lanes 5and 6) and two shifted complexes with the three-repeat sequence (lanes 8 and 9), whereas a single-telomere repeat did not exhibit any DNA binding activity (lanes 2 and 3). These results suggest that the binding site of the isolated Myb-like domain of RTBP1 is contained within the two-telomere repeat sequence TTTAGGGTTTAGGG. Although full-length TRF1 and Taz1p bind to DNA as a preformed homodimer, the isolated Myb-like domains of these proteins were capable of sequence specific binding as a monomer (20Konig P. Fairall L. Rhodes D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 1731-1740Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 23Spink K.G. Evans R.J. Chambers A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 527-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). To examine whether the isolated Myb-like domain of RTBP1 is active as a monomer, RTBP1-(506–615) was fused to the 28-kDa glutathioneS-transferase (GST) protein. Like RTBP1-(466–633), RTBP1-(506–615) contains entire Myb-like domain and was found to produce a single complex with the RTR-2 probe (see below, Fig.4 B). Gel retardation analysis was carried out using GST-RTBP1-(506–615) and RTBP1-(506–615). The two different length proteins were incubated at various concentrations with a DNA binding site containing two copies of the telomeric repeat. Each protein binds to the two-repeat sequences and forms a single complex in which migration is dependent on the size of the protein used (Fig.4 B, lanes 2 and 6). When equimolar amounts of the two proteins were used in the incubations (lane 5), a new protein·DNA complex that migrated to an intermediate position was observed. This complex likely corresponds to the binding of one molecule of each length of protein, confirming that two molecules of the Myb-like domain can bind to the two-repeat sequence. To localize the positions within the telomeric sequence at which DNA-protein interactions occurred, DNase I footprinting was performed. Uniquely end-labeled fragments containing the two-telomere repeat sequence were preincubated with the RTBP1-(466–633) and subsequently digested with limited amounts of DNase I. The DNase I footprinting on the G-rich strand revealed that the addition of RTBP1 resulted in protection of the predicted sites in the probe (Fig.5 A). The same result was obtained with the opposite, C-rich strand (Fig. 5 B). To further evaluate the sequence specificity of the RTBP1 binding activity at nucleotide level, a series of mutant oligonucleotides were synthesized and assayed for their ability to bind the isolated Myb-like domain of RTBP1. Each double-stranded oligonucleotide contained a single nucleotide transition in the two-telomere repeats (Fig.6 A). Gel retardation assays revealed that nucleoprotein complex was formed between RTBP1-(466–633) and RTR-2, and with M1, M2, M3, M11, M12, M13, and M14, whereas M4 probe was a slightly weaker binder. However, M5, M6, M7, M8, M9, and M10 probes were incapable of significant binding (Fig. 6 B). The amount of gel shift activity in the complexes was quantified for each probe. The relative amount of shifted complexes was expressed as the ratio of the amount of probe DNA in the complex to the amount of total probe DNA in each reaction (Fig. 6 C). These results indicate that the internal GGGTTT sequence in the two-telomere repeats is critical for binding of Myb-like domain of RTBP1.Figure 6Gel retardation assay of the Myb-like domain of RTBP1 to the mutated two-telomere repeats. A, telomeric sequences of mutant repeats used in the experiments. Each double-stranded probe contained a single nucleotide transition in the two-telomere repeats as indicated.

The relative amount of shifted complex was expressed as the ratios of the amount of probe DNA in the complex to the amount of total probe DNA in each reaction.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In all eukaryotic organisms, the telomere is a well conserved structure that consists of telomeric repeats and telomere binding factors. In addition to the telomeric DNA sequences, a number of proteins play integral roles in telomere structure and function. Therefore, the identification and characterization of the proteins present at the ends of chromosomes will facilitate our understanding about the functions of telomeres. In this report, we describe the molecular cloning and characterization of a gene (RTBP1) encoding a rice protein that binds the telomeric repeat sequence found in plants. Despite the apparently conserved function, several telomeric repeat-binding proteins share a limited amino acid sequence similarity. A sequence of ∼60 amino acids located in their C termini appears to be critical for DNA binding and exhibits extensive homologies with Myb repeats. An anonymous cDNA sequence encoding a Myb-like motif was reported in the data bases (19Bilaud T. Koering C.E. Binet-Brasselet E. Ancelin K. Pollice A. Gasser S.M. Gilson E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 1294-1303Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). This sequence information was used to isolate the full-length cDNA encoding the rice telomeric protein. The predicted amino acid sequence of RTBP1 includes a single Myb-like domain at its C terminus, which is very closely related to those of other telomeric proteins. Gel retardation analysis using the full-length RTBP1 and RTR-4 probe gave rise to a single DNA·protein complex, whereas the isolated Myb-like domain was found to produce three specific complexes. These results suggest that the full-length RTBP1 forms higher aggregates, which would lead to strongly cooperative binding. Using gel retardation analysis and DNase I footprinting experiments, we show that the isolated Myb-like domain of RTBP1 binds specifically to the plant telomeric DNA sequences. Telomere binding activity decreased about 9-fold upon changing the plant telomere sequence to that found in human telomere. However, RTBP1 does not exhibit significant binding activity to the C. elegans telomere sequence, indicating that its binding activity is specific to the plant telomere. Although TRF1 and Taz1p specifically bind the G-rich single strand of telomeric DNA with a much lower affinity than the corresponding duplex telomeric DNA (24Vassetzky N.S. Gaden F. Brun C. Gasser S.M. Gilson E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 4687-4694Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), RTBP1 did not bind to either single-stranded G-rich or C-rich telomeric DNA, indicating that RTBP1 binding activity is specific to the double-stranded telomeric sequence. Some telomere-binding proteins are resistant to high salt concentrations (e.g. 2 mNaCl or 6 m CsCl) (8Cardenas M.E. Bianchi A. de Lange T. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 883-894Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 37Price C.M. Cech T.R. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 769-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 38Price C.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 3421-3431Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereas other proteins are salt-sensitive (39Sheng H. Hou Z. Schierer T. Dobbs D.L. Henderson E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1144-1153Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). When the isolated Myb-like domain of RTBP1 was incubated with the RTR-4 probe in the presence of increasing amounts of NaCl concentration, the binding activity gradually decreased upon the addition of increasing salt concentrations, indicating that the binding appears to be salt-sensitive (data not shown). Gel retardation analysis with a series of mutant oligonucleotides revealed that the internal GGGTTT sequence in the two-telomere repeats is critical for the binding of the isolated Myb-like domain of RTBP1. This result is consistent with the model of the TRF1·DNA complex, showing that base-specific contacts are made within the sequence GGGTTA (20Konig P. Fairall L. Rhodes D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 1731-1740Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Their DNA binding sequences are also similar to (G)GGTGT sequence recognized by the homeodomain-like motifs of the yeast telomere-binding protein RAP1 (40Gilson E. Roberge M. Giraldo R. Rhodes D. Gasser S.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 231: 293-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). However, one of the most striking differences of the DNA binding mode between RTBP1 and TRF1 is that the isolated Myb-like domain of RTBP1 binds as a homodimer to the two-telomere repeat site. Although full-length TRF1 binds to DNA as a preformed homodimer, using a large conserved domain near the N terminus, and both Myb-like domains are required for high affinity binding (41Bianchi A. Smith S. Chong L. Elias P. de Lange T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1785-1794Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar), the isolated Myb-like domain of TRF1 binds as a monomer to the two-repeat site (20Konig P. Fairall L. Rhodes D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 1731-1740Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 42Nishikawa T. Nagado A. Yoshimura S. Aimoto S. Nishimura Y. Structure. 1998; 6: 1057-1064Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). This suggests that the DNA binding mode of RTBP1 may be different from that of TRF1. Plant proteins that specifically bind the duplex TTTAGGG repeat sequences were identified in nuclear extracts of maize and Arabidopsis (29Regad F. Lebas M. Lescure B. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 239: 163-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Computer searches in sequence data bases revealed that two plant proteins have a single Myb-like domain at their C termini and bind a specific DNA sequence related to telomeric repeats (19Bilaud T. Koering C.E. Binet-Brasselet E. Ancelin K. Pollice A. Gasser S.M. Gilson E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 1294-1303Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). The maize initiator-binding protein (IBP1) interacts at the transcription start site of the Shrunken promoter containing an exact plant telomeric repeat AGGGTTT (34Lugert T. Werr W. Plant Mol. Biol. 1994; 25: 493-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), and the parsley BoxP-binding factor (BPF1) binds a series of GT-rich motifs (35da Costa e Shilva O. Klein L. Typermelzer E. Trezzini G.F. Hahlbrock K. Plant J. 1993; 4: 125-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). These results suggest that, in addition to their function in transcriptional regulation, these proteins may have a functional role in plant telomeres. Because yeast Rap1p functions both as a structural component of yeast telomeres and a transcriptional regulator (11Lustig A.J. Kurtz S. Shore D. Science. 1990; 250: 549-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar, 12Sussel L. Shore D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7749-7753Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), the presence of Myb-like domain and the involvement of transcriptional regulation may represent universal characteristics of telomere-binding proteins. This idea is further supported by the fact that a S. pombe telomeric protein, Teb1p, may function as a general transcription factor (24Vassetzky N.S. Gaden F. Brun C. Gasser S.M. Gilson E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 4687-4694Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). An analysis of Arabidopsis DNA sequences available in data bases revealed that the sequence AAACCCTAA, corresponding to 1.3 units of the plant telomeric repeat AAACCCT, is preferentially located in the 5′ region of the genes (29Regad F. Lebas M. Lescure B. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 239: 163-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is of interest to investigate whether RTBP1 plays a role in transcriptional regulation in addition to binding to telomeric repeat sequences. The critical question that remains to be answered is whether RTBP1 binds plant telomere in vivo. The homology displayed by RTBP1 to the Myb-like domain of other telomeric proteins suggests that these proteins are functionally related. Proteins that bind the double-stranded telomeric DNA sequence have been shown to regulate telomere length negatively. Such proteins include Rap1p in budding yeast (43Marcand S. Gilson E. Shore D. Science. 1997; 275: 986-990Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar, 44Krauskopf A. Blackburn E.H. Nature. 1996; 383: 354-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), Taz1p in fission yeast (13Cooper J.P. Nimmo E.R. Allshire R.C. Cech T.R. Nature. 1997; 385: 744-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar), and TRF1 in mammalian cells (16Broccoli D. Smogorzewska A. Chong L. de Lange T. Nat. Genet. 1997; 17: 231-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (762) Google Scholar, 45Chong L. Steensel B.V. Broccoli D. Erdjument-Bromage H. Hanish J. Tempst P. de Lange T. Science. 1995; 270: 1663-1667Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar). A second mammalian telomeric protein, TRF2, plays a key role in the protection of chromosome ends from end-to-end fusion (18van Steensel B. Smogorzewska A. de Lange T. Cell. 1998; 92: 401-413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1456) Google Scholar). Recently, it has been reported that plant cell nuclei contain telomere DNA-binding proteins that can inhibit telomerase activity by altering the accessibility of telomeric DNA and may thus participate in telomere length regulation (46Fulneckova J. Fajkus J. FEBS Lett. 2000; 467: 305-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Given the evolutionary conservation of telomere sequences and functions, telomeric proteins would also be conserved. Similarly, the ability of RTBP1 to bind specifically the double-stranded plant telomeric repeat sequences in vitrosuggests that it may play a role in telomere functions in vivo. Further studies will be required to determine the actual function and physiological relevance of RTBP1 in plant cells."

The PC1 inhibitory region of proSAAS was mapped to an 8–12-residue region near the C terminus that includes a critical Lys-Arg sequence.

The inhibition becomes more effective with incubation time, indicating that the inhibitor is slow binding. A fusion protein containing the inhibitory region of proSAAS linked to the C terminus of glutathioneS-transferase binds the 71-kDa form but not the 85-kDa form of PC1. This binding, which occurs at pH 5.5 and not at pH 7.4, is stable to incubation at room temperature for 1 h in the presence or absence of 0.5% Triton X-100 and/or 0.5 mNaCl. The removal of Ca2+ with chelating agents partially releases the bound PC1. High concentrations of the inhibitory peptide quantitatively release the bound PC1.

Biotechnol. 1997; 8: 602-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Processing at these sites is accomplished by an endopeptidase that cleaves to the C-terminal side of the consensus site and then a carboxypeptidase to remove the C-terminal basic residue(s). The prohormone/proprotein convertases (PCs)1 are a family of mammalian endopeptidases that are related to bacterial subtilisin and to the yeast KEX2 endopeptidase (1Zhou A. Webb G. Zhu X. Steiner D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20745-20748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar, 2Seidah N.G. Chretien M. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 1997; 8: 602-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). The PCs can be divided into two subgroups based on their distribution within cells. One group, which includes furin, PACE4, PC5B (also known as PC6B), and PC7 (also known as PC8 and LPC), is primarily localized to the trans-Golgi network in a variety of cell types (1Zhou A. Webb G. Zhu X. Steiner D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20745-20748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar, 2Seidah N.G. Chretien M. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 1997; 8: 602-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). The other group, which includes PC1 (also known as PC3), PC2, and PC5A (also known as PC6A), is enriched in secretory vesicles in neuroendocrine cell types (1Zhou A. Webb G. Zhu X. Steiner D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20745-20748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar, 2Seidah N.G. Chretien M. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 1997; 8: 602-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). In contrast to the multitude of PCs, only two carboxypeptidases are thought to be involved in processing proteins in the secretory pathway. Carboxypeptidase D is primarily localized to the trans-Golgi network, and carboxypeptidase E is enriched in secretory vesicles (3Varlamov O. Fricker L.D. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 877-885Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,4Varlamov O. Eng F.J. Novikova E.G. Fricker L.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14759-14767Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The enzymes localized to the trans-Golgi network are thought to process proteins that transit the constitutive secretory pathway, such as the insulin receptor and some growth factors (5Bresnahan P.A.

FEBS Lett. 1993; 328: 25-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The secretory vesicle enzymes are primarily involved in the processing of neuroendocrine peptides (1Zhou A. Webb G. Zhu X.

Biotechnol. 1997; 8: 602-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar).A large number of enzyme systems have endogenous inhibitors that serve to regulate the enzyme activity. All of the PCs are initially produced as zymogens that must be proteolytically activated (1Zhou A. Webb G. Zhu X. Steiner D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20745-20748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar, 2Seidah N.G. Chretien M. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 1997; 8: 602-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). In some cases, the pro-segment is still an effective inhibitor even after initial proteolysis and additional cleavages are required to fully activate the enzyme (8Boudreault A. Gauthier D. Lazure C.

In addition to being produced as a pro-form, PC2 is also co-expressed with an endogenous chaperone/inhibitor, 7B2 (10Braks J.A.M. Martens G.J.M. Cell. 1994; 78: 263-273Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). 7B2 was initially discovered as a granin-like protein present in the secretory pathway of neuroendocrine cells (11Hsi K.L. Seidah N.G. DeSerres G. Chretien M. FEBS Lett. 1982; 147: 261-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). This protein is initially produced as a 27–30-kDa protein that is proteolytically processed by furin (12Paquet L. Bergeron F. Boudreault A. Seidah N.G. Chretien M. Mbikay M. Lazure C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19279-19285Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) into a 31-residue C-terminal peptide (13Zhu X. Rouille Y. Lamango N.S. Steiner D.F. Lindberg I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4919-4924Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Although co-expression of 7B2 is necessary for the production of active PC2 (14Zhu X. Lindberg I. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1641-1650Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), the C-terminal peptide of 7B2 is also a potent inhibitor of PC2 (13Zhu X. Rouille Y. Lamango N.S. Steiner D.F. Lindberg I.

Chem. 1995; 270: 14292-14296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). PC2 slowly cleaves at a Lys-Lys site within this C-terminal peptide, and then, following the action of a carboxypeptidase, the cleaved peptide is no longer inhibitory toward PC2 (13Zhu X. Rouille Y. Lamango N.S. Steiner D.F. Lindberg I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4919-4924Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar).Recently, a novel secretory pathway protein was detected while analyzing peptides that were not properly processed in mice lacking carboxypeptidase E activity (16Fricker L.D. McKinzie A.A. Sun J. Curran E. Qian Y. Yan L. Patterson S.D. Courchesne P.L. Richards B. Levin N. Mzhavia N. Devi L.A. Douglass J. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 639-648Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The Cpe fat /Cpe fat mice contain a point mutation in the carboxypeptidase E gene that renders the enzyme inactive (17Naggert J.K. Fricker L.D. Varlamov O. Nishina P.M. Rouille Y. Steiner D.F. Carroll R.J. Paigen B.J. Leiter E.H. Nat. Genet. 1995; 10: 135-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar). Without active carboxypeptidase E, these mice accumulate peptides with C-terminal Lys and/or Arg extensions (17Naggert J.K. Fricker L.D. Varlamov O. Nishina P.M. Rouille Y. Steiner D.F. Carroll R.J.

Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 2954-2958Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). A large number of improperly processed peptides were detected using an affinity column to isolate peptides with C-terminal basic residues fromCpe fat /Cpe fat tissues (16Fricker L.D. McKinzie A.A. Sun J. Curran E. Qian Y. Yan L. Patterson S.D. Courchesne P.L. Richards B. Levin N. Mzhavia N. Devi L.A. Douglass J. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 639-648Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mass spectrometry-based sequence analysis revealed that five of these peptides were encoded by a novel protein, designated proSAAS (16Fricker L.D. McKinzie A.A. Sun J. Curran E. Qian Y. Yan L. Patterson S.D. Courchesne P.L. Richards B. Levin N. Mzhavia N. Devi L.A. Douglass J. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 639-648Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although there is no amino acid sequence homology between proSAAS and 7B2, they are both similar sizes, they both contain a relatively high percentage of proline as well as several pairs of basic amino acids, and they both have a broad neuroendocrine tissue distribution (10Braks J.A.M. Martens G.J.M. Cell. 1994; 78: 263-273Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 11Hsi K.L. Seidah N.G. DeSerres G. Chretien M. FEBS Lett. 1982; 147: 261-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 16Fricker L.D. McKinzie A.A. Sun J. Curran E. Qian Y. Yan L. Patterson S.D. Courchesne P.L. Richards B. Levin N. Mzhavia N.

Cell Tissue Res. 1987; 250: 205-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Based on this similarity and on the finding that overexpression of proSAAS in AtT-20 cells inhibited the processing of the endogenous prohormone, proopiomelanocortin, proSAAS was directly tested with PC1 and PC2 (16Fricker L.D. McKinzie A.A. Sun J. Curran E. Qian Y. Yan L. Patterson S.D. Courchesne P.L. Richards B. Levin N. Mzhavia N. Devi L.A. Douglass J. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 639-648Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This analysis revealed that proSAAS inhibited PC1 but not PC2. The specificity of proSAAS for other members of the PC family was not previously investigated. In this study, we report that proSAAS is highly specific for PC1 and does not inhibit other members of this gene family. In addition, we map the inhibitory region to a short 8–12-amino acid segment near the C terminus of proSAAS. Peptides corresponding to this region inhibit PC1 with a slow onset of action that is partially competitive with substrate. Finally, this region of proSAAS is able to bind PC1 tightly with a slow dissociation rate. Taken together, these data support the proposal that one of the physiological functions of proSAAS is to inhibit PC1.RESULTSPreviously, rat proSAAS produced as a GST fusion protein in bacteria was found to inhibit PC1 (16Fricker L.D. McKinzie A.A. Sun J. Curran E. Qian Y. Yan L. Patterson S.D. Courchesne P.L. Richards B. Levin N. Mzhavia N. Devi L.A. Douglass J. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 639-648Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To assess the specificity of proSAAS for PC1, the GST-proSAAS fusion protein was tested with other members of the PC family. At 2 μm concentration the GST-proSAAS does not significantly inhibit PC2, furin, PACE4, PC5, or PC7 (Table I). Although a small decrease in PC2 activity was observed, this decrease was not significantly different from the activity in the presence of GST alone (Table I). In addition, kexin activity was not significantly affected by this concentration of GST-proSAAS (not shown).Table IEffect of 2 μm GST-proSAAS or GST on the activity of various members of the prohormone convertase familyEnzymeActivity1-aValues are the averages of three separate experiments, each performed in duplicate using 100 μm pyroGlu-Arg-Thr-Lys-Arg-AMC substrate.GST aloneGST-proSAAS% control ± S.D.PC176 ± 420 ± 1PC283 ± 1070 ± 8Furin103 ± 2101 ± 3PACE4101 ± 2105 ± 4PC5A103 ± 3102 ± 4PC799 ± 397 ± 41-a Values are the averages of three separate experiments, each performed in duplicate using 100 μm pyroGlu-Arg-Thr-Lys-Arg-AMC substrate. Open table in a new tab To map the inhibitory region of rat proSAAS, a series of deletion mutants was expressed as GST fusion proteins and tested with baculovirus-expressed PC1. Deletion of the C-terminal 28 residues abolished the effectiveness of proSAAS as a PC1 inhibitor (Fig.1, 34–232). Conversely, constructs that contained the C-terminal 30 residues (Fig. 1,231–260 and others) were inhibitory. Further deletion analysis indicated that the 16-residue region from residues 231–246 of rat proSAAS were inhibitory (Fig. 1); this region contains an internal Lys-Arg sequence that was previously found to be cleaved in AtT-20 cells and in mouse brain (16Fricker L.D. McKinzie A.A. Sun J. Curran E. Qian Y. Yan L. Patterson S.D. Courchesne P.L. Richards B. Levin N. Mzhavia N. Devi L.A. Douglass J. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 639-648Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Synthetic peptides corresponding to the cleavage products were ineffective as PC1 inhibitors (Fig. 1). The inhibitory activity of the 16-residue proSAAS C-terminal peptide is not dependent on attachment to GST; cleavage with thrombin did not alter the inhibitory potency of the construct. Mutation of both the Lys243 and Arg244 to Ala within the construct containing residues 231–246 of proSAAS destroyed the ability of this fragment to inhibit PC1 activity (Fig. 1).To further map the inhibitory region, a series of peptides was synthesized. A 17-residue peptide corresponding to residues 231–246 of proSAAS with an additional Tyr on the N terminus inhibited PC1 with an IC50 of approximately 35 nm (Fig.2, YE17). The 14- and 12-residue peptides showed comparable potency toward PC1, whereas the 10- and 8-residue peptides had IC50 values around 70 nm (Fig. 2). To test whether this inhibition is due to a nonpeptide contaminant present in the peptide, the peptides were treated with trypsin, the trypsin was then heat-inactivated, and the peptides were tested with PC1. This trypsin treatment eliminated the inhibitory activity of the peptides toward PC1, indicating that the inhibition was due to a peptide component (and also supporting the data shown in Fig. 1 illustrating the importance of the intact Lys-Arg sequence for PC1 inhibition). The specificity of YE-17 for various members of the PC family was evaluated. As found with full-length proSAAS, low concentrations (0.25–2 μm) of YE-17 selectively inhibit PC1. However, at 25 μm YE-17 some inhibition of PC7 and furin were detected and to a much lesser extent PC5 and PACE4 (not shown). It is possible that this inhibition observed with 25 μm YE-17 is due to competition with the 100 μm substrate.Figure 2Effect of synthetic proSAAS C-terminal peptides on the activity of purified PC1. The peptides were tested with purified PC1 (63 ng) and 100 μm substrate, as described under “Materials and Methods.” The data shown were obtained after 90 min of incubation at 25 °C. The experiment was performed three times with less than 10% variation.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Kinetic analysis of PC1 in the presence of various concentrations of YE-17 showed a mixture of noncompetitive and competitive-type inhibition with a Ki of 14 nm (Fig.3). Similar analysis of LE-8 showed pure competitive inhibition kinetics (not shown). The portion of inhibition that appears to be noncompetitive may be due to slow dissociation of YE-17 from the active site rather than true noncompetitive inhibition. Analysis of the time course of PC1 activity in the presence of various amounts of YE-17 showed that relatively high concentrations of peptide did not immediately inhibit PC1 (Fig. 4). Instead, the progress curves for the reaction followed typical slow binding kinetics, with greater inhibition observed at later reaction times (Fig. 4).Figure 3Double reciprocal plots of purified PC1 activity with two concentrations of YE-17. Purified PC1 (63 ng) was added to a mixture of the indicated concentrations of YE-17 and substrate, as described under “Materials and Methods.” The data were obtained after 55–90 min incubation at 25 °C.

The resin was washed briefly with binding buffer, and the bound material was eluted by boiling in 1% SDS. When the binding was performed at pH 5.5, the 71-kDa form of PC1 in the baculovirus media bound to the full-length proSAAS construct (Fig. 5,lanes 2) and the construct containing proSAAS 221–260 (Fig. 5, lanes 3). No binding was detected to GST alone (Fig. 5, lanes 1) or to the construct containing proSAAS 34–174 (Fig. 5, lanes 4), which lacks the C-terminal PC1 inhibitory region. When binding was performed at pH 7.4, no binding was detected for any of the constructs or forms of PC1 (Fig. 5, bottom panel). Longer exposures of the Western blot revealed that in addition to the 71-kDa form, the less abundant 75-kDa form of PC1 in the media (but not the 85-kDa form) showed some binding to the full-length proSAAS and to proSAAS 221–260 at pH 5.5 but not to the other inactive constructs (not shown).Figure 5Western blot analysis of PC1 binding to GST-proSAAS constructs. Medium from Sf9 cells infected with PC1-expressing baculovirus was combined with either GST or a GST-proSAAS fusion protein at pH 5.5 (top panel) or pH 7.4 (bottom panel). Then glutathione-agarose was added, the tubes were mixed for 1 h and centrifuged, and the supernatant was removed for Western blot analysis (Unbound). The pellet was washed twice with 1.5 ml of binding buffer for 3 min each (Wash 1 and Wash 2). Then the pellet was heated at 95 °C in 1% SDS to extract the PC1 bound to the resin (Bound). The same relative amount of each fraction was analyzed on a Western blot that was probed with 1:1000 dilution of an antiserum directed against PC1.

In the presence of buffer alone, all of the PC1 remained bound to the GST-proSAAS construct (Fig.6). The addition of 0.5 mNaCl and 0.5% Triton X-100 did not release the bound PC1 (Fig. 6,lanes Tx). The calcium chelator EDTA was partially effective at releasing the bound PC1 (Fig. 6). The peptide YE-17 quantitatively released the bound PC1 when tested at either 100 or 300 μm (Fig. 6), but 1 μm peptide was ineffective (not shown). Approximately 50% of the bound PC1 was released by the peptide within 10 min of incubation (Fig.6 C). However, incubation for 70 min with 100 μm of the PC1 substrate pGlu-Arg-Thr-Lys-Arg-MCA was not effective in releasing bound PC1 (Fig. 6 C).Figure 6Western blot analysis of release of proSAAS-bound PC1.

Although relatively high concentrations of the C-terminal inhibitory peptide YE-17 do inhibit some of the other PCs, this could simply be competition with substrate and not tight binding as found for proSAAS and PC1. The low nm Ki for the C-terminal proSAAS peptides with PC1 is likely to be within the physiological range based on the relatively high abundance of proSAAS-derived peptides detected upon mass spectrometry of mouse brain (16Fricker L.D. McKinzie A.A. Sun J. Curran E. Qian Y. Yan L. Patterson S.D. Courchesne P.L. Richards B. Levin N. Mzhavia N. Devi L.A. Douglass J. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 639-648Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Another important finding is that the inhibitory region of proSAAS is within a short 8–12-residue sequence near the C terminus. This region of proSAAS (VLGALLRVKRLE) is completely conserved among human, rat, and mouse (16Fricker L.D. McKinzie A.A. Sun J. Curran E. Qian Y. Yan L. Patterson S.D. Courchesne P.L. Richards B. Levin N. Mzhavia N. Devi L.A. Douglass J. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 639-648Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and has sequence similarity (5 matches over 12 residues) to both the C-terminal region and the pro-region of rat PC1. Interestingly, both the pro-region (8Boudreault A. Gauthier D. Lazure C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31574-31580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) and the C-terminal region of PC1 (27Jutras I. Seidah N.G. Reudelhuber T.L. Brechler V. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15184-15188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) have been shown to be inhibitory toward PC1. However, the inhibitory sequences within these regions have not been defined, and it is premature to speculate that the regions in PC1 with amino acid similarity to proSAAS are functional. Interestingly, this region of proSAAS contains the LLRVKR sequence previously identified from a screen of a peptide combinatorial library (28Apletalina E. Appel J. Lamango N.S. Houghten R.A. Lindberg I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26589-26595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The hexapeptide acetyl-LLRVKR-amide was the most potent inhibitor of PC1 found from this analysis (28Apletalina E. Appel J. Lamango N.S. Houghten R.A. Lindberg I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26589-26595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Consistent with our finding that LE-8 inhibits PC1 in a purely competitive fashion, the hexapeptide was also found to be a competitive fast-binding inhibitor (28Apletalina E. Appel J. Lamango N.S. Houghten R.A. Lindberg I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26589-26595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Thus, the additional N- and/or C-terminal residues in proSAAS and in YE-17 contribute to the slow tight binding inhibition of PC1.Surprisingly, the short proSAAS peptides are more potent than full-length proSAAS as PC1 inhibitors. This may be due to improper folding of the majority of GST-proSAAS fusion protein produced in bacteria. Although the short 8–16-residue inhibitory peptides are not likely to be present in neuroendocrine tissues, a 4-kDa peptide that includes this 16-residue region has been detected upon overexpression of proSAAS in AtT-20 cells (16Fricker L.D. McKinzie A.A. Sun J. Curran E. Qian Y. Yan L. Patterson S.D. Courchesne P.L. Richards B. Levin N. Mzhavia N. Devi L.A. Douglass J. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 639-648Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This 4-kDa C-terminal fragment is the major form of C-terminal immunoreactive peptide secreted from the proSAAS-expressing AtT-20 cells (16Fricker L.D. McKinzie A.A. Sun J. Curran E. Qian Y. Yan L. Patterson S.D. Courchesne P.L. Richards B. Levin N. Mzhavia N. Devi L.A. Douglass J. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 639-648Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to the 4-kDa fragment, shorter C-terminal fragments were detected in the media of these AtT-20 cells, indicating that cleavage had occurred at the critical Lys-Arg site within the inhibitory region (16Fricker L.D. McKinzie A.A. Sun J. Curran E. Qian Y. Yan L. Patterson S.D. Courchesne P.L. Richards B. Levin N. Mzhavia N. Devi L.A. Douglass J. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 639-648Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Another major finding of the present study is that proSAAS binds tightly to PC1. Although other investigators have not detected proSAAS during searches of proteins that bind to PC1, 2N. Seidah, unpublished results., 3I. Lindberg, personal communication.these studies used [35S]Met-labeled cell extracts and would therefore not have detected proSAAS because this protein lacks Met (except for the initiation methionine, which is cleaved off with the rest of the signal peptide). Also like 7B2 (11Hsi K.L. Seidah N.G. DeSerres G. Chretien M. FEBS Lett. 1982; 147: 261-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), proSAAS stains extremely weakly with Coomassie Blue and silver staining procedures and has an extremely low extinction coefficient at 280 nm because of the low abundance of aromatic residues (16Fricker L.D.

Thus, proSAAS has presumably been undetected in previous studies because of the inadequacy of tools to visualize this protein.The tight binding and potent inhibition of PC1 by proSAAS raises the issue as to how this inhibition is regulated. A likely mechanism is cleavage at the Lys-Arg sequence within the inhibitory region; as mentioned above, forms of smaller proSAAS peptides resulting from cleavage at this site have been detected in mouse brain and proSAAS-expressing AtT-20 cells (16Fricker L"

This reflects tight and specific binding between ERK and the MKP-3 amino terminus with consequent phosphatase activation and dephosphorylation of the bound MAP kinase. We have used a series of p38/ERK chimeric molecules to identify domains within ERK necessary for binding and catalytic activation of MKP-3. These studies demonstrate that ERK kinase subdomains V-XI are necessary and sufficient for binding and catalytic activation of MKP-3. These domains constitute the major COOH-terminal structural lobe of ERK. p38/ERK chimeras possessing these regions display increased sensitivity to inactivation by MKP-3. These data also reveal an overlap between ERK domains interacting with MKP-3 and those known to confer substrate specificity on the ERK MAP kinase. Consistent with this, we show that peptides representing docking sites within the target substrates Elk-1 and p90rskinhibit ERK-dependent activation of MKP-3. In addition, abolition of ERK-dependent phosphatase activation following mutation of a putative kinase interactionmotif (KIM) within the MKP-3 NH2 terminus suggests that key sites of contact for the ERK COOH-terminal structural lobe include residues localized between the Cdc25 homology domains (CH2) found conserved between members of the DSP gene family.

In mammalian cells at least four MAP kinase classes have been identified. These are known as the extracellular signal regulated kinase (ERK), the c-Jun N-terminal kinase/stress-activated protein kinase (JNK/SAPK), the p38/RK/CSBP (p38), and BMK1/ERK5 MAP kinases. In addition to this diversity, multiple genes and splice variants of each MAP kinase class have also been identified (1Cohen P.

A smaller NH2-terminal domain comprises kinase subdomains I-IV together with the COOH-terminal tail (L16) and is made up mostly from β-strands. The COOH-terminal domain, by contrast, includes kinase subdomains V-XI and is rich in α-helices. ATP binds deep in the active site cleft formed between the two domains whereas substrate protein is believed to associate with a groove formed on the surface of the COOH-terminal domain. MAP kinases phosphorylate only substrates that contain proline in the P+1 site which binds within a surface pocket formed by residues highly conserved in the MAP kinase family. This P+1 specificity pocket is contiguous with the “activation loop” or “lip” which contains conserved Thr and Tyr residues important for control of MAP kinase activation state (see below). Different cell stimuli activate preferentially distinct MAP kinases. Hence, while ERKs are highly responsive to growth factors, phorbol esters, and some oncogenes, JNK/SAPK and p38 MAP kinases are activated by inflammatory cytokines and cell stresses (1Cohen P.

Recent studies using mutant kinases, chemical inhibitors, or gene deletion in mice indicate a key role for MAP kinases in controlling several diverse cell functions. ERK MAP kinases, for instance, appear important in pathways leading to cellular proliferation, oncogenic transformation, and metastasis, as well as in processes underlying memory and learning. JNK/SAPK and p38 MAP kinases, in contrast, appear to control T cell differentiation, production of inflammatory cytokines and events leading to neuronal apoptotic death (1Cohen P.

These observations indicate that mechanisms controlling MAP kinases are likely to be of central importance to several diverse aspects of normal and pathological cell functions. MAP kinase activation is triggered by phosphorylation on specific Thr and Tyr residues localized within the activation loop TXY motif of kinase domain VIII (where X is Glu, Pro, or Gly in ERK, JNK/SAPK or p38 MAP kinases, respectively). Several upstream kinases are now known to activate different MAP kinases selectively (1Cohen P. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 353-361Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar, 2Marshall C.J.

Notwithstanding the importance of such stimulatory input, MAP kinase activation is normally reversible in cells indicating that protein phosphatases also provide an important mechanism for control. Dual specificity phosphatases (DSPs) represent a subclass of the protein-tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) gene superfamily which appear to play an important role dephosphorylating and inactivating MAP kinases. Nine distinct DSPs have now been reported including CL100/MKP-1 (19Keyse S.M. Emslie E.A. Nature. 1992; 359: 644-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar,20Sun H. Charles C.H. Lau L.F.

Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6981-6988Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Some DSPs are localized to different subcellular compartments and moreover, several DSP genes undergo powerful induction following exposure to cell stresses and/or growth factors (36Camps M. Nichols A. Arkinstall S. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 6-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (720) Google Scholar). This, together with recent reports of specific MAP kinase inactivation by some DSPs suggests a sophisticated transcriptional mechanism for inactivation of selected MAP kinase activities. MKP-3 is a selective DSP that mediates preferential dephosphorylation and inactivation of ERK1 and ERK2 MAP kinases (32Groom L.A. Sneddon A.A. Alessi D.R. Dowd S. Keyse S.M.

We have reported recently that this reflects tight and specific binding of ERK to non-catalytic regions within the MKP-3 amino terminus and that this triggers a powerful increase in MKP-3 phosphatase activity (38Muda M. Theodosiou A. Gillieron C. Smith A. Chabert C. Camps M. Boschert U. Rodrigues N. Davies K. Ashworth A. Arkinstall S. J. Biol.

Science. 1998; 280: 1262-1265Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). Other DSPs also display binding and activation by ERK, JNK/SAPK, and p38 suggesting a general mechanism for targeted inactivation of different MAP kinases (39Camps M. Nichols A. Gillieron C. Antonsson B. Muda M. Chabert C. Boschert U. Arkinstall S. Science. 1998; 280: 1262-1265Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). One important unanswered question is of the molecular domains within MAP kinases important for specific binding and catalytic activation of DSPs. To address this question we have employed a number of p38/ERK chimeric molecules used previously to reveal domains within MAP kinases important for interactions with upstream activating kinases and that target substrate proteins (40Brunet A. Pouyssegur J. Science. 1996; 272: 1652-1655Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 41Wilsbacher J.L. Goldsmith E.J. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16988-16994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Based on studies with purified MKP-3, it appears that regions localized within the COOH-terminal structural lobe of ERK are essential for binding and catalytic activation of MKP-3. These subdomains include regions believed to be important for substrate binding and consistent with this, peptides based on the ERK substrates Elk-1 and p90rsk inhibit MKP-3 catalytic activation by this MAP kinase. Constructs encoding the p38α/ERK1 chimeras (Chim I, III, V, VII, VIII, XI, and p38-ERK-p38) described previously (40Brunet A. Pouyssegur J. Science. 1996; 272: 1652-1655Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) were used as a basis for constructs enabling bacterial expression of these proteins with an N-terminal His6-tag. Subcloning involved inserting aBsmBI-XhoI PCR fragment from each p38α-ERK1 chimera containing a 5′ NcoI compatible site and nucleotides encoding a His6-tag into theNcoI-XhoI sites of pET23D. TheBsmBI-XhoI PCR fragments were obtained by two separate PCR reactions. In the first step the coding region of the different chimera was amplified using the sense His6-p38α primer 5′-GCTCACCACCACCACCACCACATGTCGCAGGAGAGGCCCACG-3′ together with the ERK1 antisense primer 5′-ATCTGCTCGAGTCAGGGGGCCTCTGGTGCCCCTGG-3′. The resulting PCR products were then used as templates in a second amplification using the same antisense primer together with a commonBsmBI-His6 5′ sense primer including aNcoI compatible 5′ BsmBI followed by nucleotides encoding the His6-tag (5′-TCTATTTAAAGAATTCGCTATCGATCGTCTCCCATGGCTCACCACCACCACCACCAC-3′). The wild type p38α construct was obtained by the same PCR procedure using the primer His6-p38α in combination with an antisense p38α-Xho-3′ primer 5′-ATCTGCTCGAGTCAGGACTCCATTTCTTCTTGGTC-3′. A wild type ERK1 bacterial expression construct was obtained directly by one PCR amplification using a 5′-sense primer including a BsmBI site followed by nucleotides encoding the His6-tag and p44 ERK1 sequence (5′-TCTATTTAAAGAATTCGCTATCGATCGTCTCCCATGGCTCATCATCACCATCACCATGGCGGGGAGCCCCGGGGA-3′) in combination with the ERK1 Xho-3′ antisense primer. His6-tagged p38α/ERK2 chimeras EIIP, EIIPIVE, and PIVECTP were exactly as described previously (41Wilsbacher J.L. Goldsmith E.J. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16988-16994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). For protein purification transformed bacteria were grown overnight to saturation in LB medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin, after which growth was resumed by diluting the culture 1:50 and incubating at 37 °C for 1 h. Following transfer to 20 °C for 1 h, isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 100 μm and cells cultured for another 14 h. Cells were harvested, resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm EDTA, 5 mmbenzamidine, and 1 mm PefablocTM (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and broken by passing three times through a French Press at 1000 p.s.i. The extract was then centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C and purified using Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen) according to the manufacturers instructions. All proteins were >90% pure as assessed by Coomassie Blue staining. GST-MKP-3, GST-MKP-3ΔC, and GST-MKP-3ΔN were exactly as described previously (38Muda M. Theodosiou A. Gillieron C. Smith A.

The MKP-3 kinaseinteraction motif (KIM) mutants MKP-3 (I61A), MKP-3 (R64A), MKP-3 (R65A), MKP-3 (R64, 65A), MKP-3 (L71A), and MKP-3 (V73A) were produced by subcloning a BamHI-NotI MKP-3 mutated PCR fragment into the BamHI-NotI site of pGEX4T3 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in-frame with GST. The MKP-3-mutated fragments were produced by a two-step PCR reaction. First, the 5′ terminus of MKP-3 was amplified using a senseBamHI containing primer (5′-GCCGGATCCATGATAGATACGCTCAGACC-3′) together with antisense primers encoding the desired amino acid mutation. The antisense primers for each mutant were as follows: MKP-3 (I61A), 5′-CGCCGCAGCATTGCGCCCGGGATGGCCACGTTGAT-3′; MKP-3 (R64A), 5′-CCCTTCTGCAGACGGGCCAGCATGA-3′; MKP-3 (R65A), 5′-CCCTTCTGCAGAGCCCGCAGCATGA-3′; MKP-3 (R64A/ R65A), 5′ CCCTTCTGCAGAGCGGCCAGCATGA-3′; MKP-3 (L71A), 5′-CGCACCGGGGCGTTGCCCTTCTGCAGAC-3′; and MKP-3 (V73A), 5′-CGCGCGCGCCGGCAGGTTGCCCTTCTGCAGAC-3′. The 3′- terminal of MKP-3 was amplified using an antisense NotI containing primer ((5′-AGGTATCGCTGCGGCCGCTCACGTAGATTGCAGGGAGTC-3′) together with sense primers encoding the mutated amino acid. The sense primers were as follows: MKP-3 (I61A), 5′-GGCCATCCCGGGCGCAATGCTGCGGCGTCTGCAGA-3′; MKP-3 (R64A), 5′-ATCATGCTGGCCCGTCTGCAGAAGG-3; MKP-3 (R65A), 5′- ATCATGCTGCGGGCTCTGCAGAAGG-3′; MKP-3 (R64A/R65A), 5′-ATCATGCTGGCCGCTCTGCAGAAGG-3′; MKP-3 (L71A), 5′-GTCTGCAGAAGGGCAACGCCCCGGTGCG-3′; and MKP-3 (V73A), 5′-AAGGGCAACCTGCCGGCGCGCGCGCTATTCACG-3′. The two PCR products were then mixed and amplified using the sense BamHI primer and the antisense NotI primer. All pGEX4T3/MKP-3 mutants were verified by sequencing. GST-MKP-3 and the above mutants were expressed and purified from bacteria, assessed for phosphatase activity and binding to MAP kinase chimeras exactly as described previously (38Muda M.

Inactivation by MKP-3 or MKP-3 mutants was assessed by inclusion of 0.01–10 μg of the GST-MKP-3 proteins as indicated. Reactions were terminated and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide electrophoresis and autoradiography as described before (38Muda M. Theodosiou A. Gillieron C. Smith A. Chabert C. Camps M. Boschert U.

To investigate which domains within ERK are critical for interacting with MKP-3 we employed a series of p38α/ERK1 chimeras (40Brunet A. Pouyssegur J.

Following extensive washing, Western blot analysis was used to indicate binding between different p38α/ERK1 chimeras and the MKP-3 NH2terminus. As observed previously, no binding between p38α and MKP-3ΔC was detected (Fig. 1 B). Similarly, chimera XI, which contains predominantly the p38α sequence except for kinase subdomain XI and the carboxyl terminus of ERK1, was found to bind only very weakly to immobilized GST-MKP-3ΔC (Fig. 1 B). Chimeras VIII and VII contain progressively longer carboxyl-terminal sequences from ERK1 including, respectively, either kinase subdomain VIII or subdomain VII together with the activation loop. In contrast to chimera XI, chimeras VIII and VII both bound to immobilized MKP-3ΔC (Fig. 1 B). Since chimeras VIII and VII bind MKP-3 similarly, neither the activation loop or kinase domain VII of ERK appear to confer any additional capacity for binding MKP-3. This is consistent with the failure of a p44 ERK1 loop chimera (p38α possessing the activation loop of ERK1) (40Brunet A. Pouyssegur J. Science. 1996; 272: 1652-1655Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) to exhibit any detectable binding to MKP-3ΔC (Fig. 1 B). Increasing further the proportion of COOH-terminal ERK1 sequence up to and including kinase subdomains V (chimera V), III (chimera III), or I (chimera I) resulted in a further increase in binding to MKP-3ΔC (Fig. 1 B). Similar results were observed when binding was assessed using full-length GST-MKP-3 or when lysates from COS-7 cells transfected with HA-tagged versions of the p38α/ERK1 chimeras were incubated with immobilized GST-MKP-3ΔC (data not shown).Figure 1Purified p38/ERK chimera binding to MKP-3 ΔC. A series of p38α/ERK1 chimeric molecules (schematically represented in Fig. 6) were expressed inE. coli as His6-tagged molecules. A, Coomassie Blue-stained His6-tagged p38α/ERK1 chimeras following their purification by Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose and separation by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis using a 12% gel. Chimeras comprise COOH-terminal ERK1 sequence up to and including kinase subdomain I (Chim I), subdomain III (Chim III), subdomain V (Chim V), subdomain VII (Chim VII), subdomain VIII (Chim VIII), and subdomain XI (Chim XI) with p38α residues constituting the remaining NH2 terminus. p38-ERK-p38 represents an additional chimera constituting p38α sequence except for the activation loop of ERK1. Bovine serum albumin (BSA) was used a standard (10 or 20 μg) for Coomassie staining. B,His6-tagged ERK, p38α, or p38α/ERK1 chimeras (as indicated) were incubated with glutathione-Sepharose beads prebound to GST-MKP-3ΔC. Western analysis of washed beads was performed using anti-His6 monoclonal antibody with goat anti-mouse monoclonal antibody horseradish peroxidase conjugate and chemiluminescence. This binding experiment is representative of three separate experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) ERK1 or ERK2 binding to the NH2 terminus of MKP-3 triggers a powerful increase in phosphatase activity. In contrast, neither JNK/SAPK nor p38 MAP kinases bind or activate MKP-3 (38Muda M. Theodosiou A. Gillieron C. Smith A. Chabert C. Camps M. Boschert U. Rodrigues N. Davies K. Ashworth A.

Arkinstall S. Science. 1998; 280: 1262-1265Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). This suggests a correlation between tight MAP kinase binding and activation of the MKP-3 phosphatase. To test this correlation further, we next assessed the ability of different p38α/ERK1 chimeras to stimulate catalytic activity of purified MKP-3 as assessed by hydrolysis of the artificial substrate p-nitrophenyl phosphate. As anticipated from this relationship, both chimera XI and the p44 ERK1 loop chimera were indistinguishable from p38α and totally ineffective as activators of the MKP-3 phosphatase (Fig.2 A). In contrast, chimeras VIII and VII both elicited weak, but a clearly detectable increase in MKP-3 phosphatase activity (Fig. 2 A). Chimeras V, III, and I were different again insofar that all three are highly effective stimulators of MKP-3 phosphatase activity and similar to that seen with control purified ERK2 (Fig. 2 A). These data indicate a correlation between binding and catalytic activation of MKP-3 by the p38α/ERK1 chimeras. To assess further the importance of ERK kinase subdomains in activating MKP-3, we employed some additional chimeras made using sequence from p38α and ERK2 (41Wilsbacher J.L. Goldsmith E.J. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16988-16994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Chimera PIVECTP is similar to chimera V except that it also possesses the COOH-terminal loop L16 of p38α (see Fig. 6for an illustration of these chimeras). This chimera was designed so that the NH2- and COOH-terminal major structural domains are contributed by p38α or ERK2 sequences, respectively (41Wilsbacher J.L. Goldsmith E.J. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16988-16994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Chimera PIVECTP stimulates powerful activation of MKP-3 and to an extent similar to chimera V (Fig. 2 B). Since chimeras V and III stimulate similar activation of MKP-3 (Fig. 2 A) the role of ERK kinase subdomains III and IV in this activity is unclear. Chimera EIIPIVE is constituted mainly of ERK2 sequence although kinase subdomains III and IV have been substituted with cognate residues from p38α. This chimera stimulates MKP-3 activation in a manner indistinguishable from chimera PIVECTP and chimera V (Fig.2 B). Also addressing the possible role of the NH2-terminal region of ERK, chimera EIIP comprises p38α except for ERK2 subdomains I and II and this molecule was found totally inactive in this assay (Fig. 2 B). Consistent with a close correlation between MKP-3 catalytic activation and MAP kinase binding, chimeras PIVECTP and EIIPIVE, but not EIIP, bound and precipitated with GST-MKP-3 immobilized on beads (not shown). We have shown previously that the sevenmaker MAP kinase mutant ERK2 (D319N) displays reduced binding and catalytic activation of MKP-3 (39Camps M. Nichols A. Gillieron C. Antonsson B. Muda M.

A TGF-β-inducible early gene (TIEG) was discovered and shown by this laboratory to be a 3-zinc finger transcription factor family member; its expression is rapidly induced in cells treated with TGF-β. To ascertain whether TIEG plays a major role in the TGF-β pathway, human osteosarcoma MG-63 cells were stably transfected either with an expression vector containing a TIEG cDNA or with the vector alone. Clones that contain only the vector express normal levels of TIEG mRNA and protein and display the same patterns of gene expression and levels of cell proliferation as the nontransfected, non-TGF-β-treated parental cells. However, transfected cells that overexpress TIEG mRNA and protein (TIEG-6 and TIEG-7) display changes that mimic those of MG-63 cells treated with TGF-β, i.e. increased alkaline phosphatase activity, decreased levels of osteocalcin mRNA and protein, and decreased cell proliferation. The degree of these changes correlated with the level of TIEG expressed in the cell lines. TGF-β treatment of the overexpressed cells showed no added effects.

The cellular processes affected by TGF-β include inhibiting proliferation, inducing cell differentiation and apoptosis, and altering gene expression.

In rodent and human OBs, TGF-β is involved in the regulation of 1) proliferation of OB cells, which appears to occur at the G1 phase of the cell cycle; 2) the proliferation and differentiation of OB osteoprogenitor cells; and 3) OB bone matrix production and mineralization (5.Bonewald L.F.

TGF-β appears to directly increase OB activity and differentiation, to uncouple OB and OCL activities, and to result in bone loss.Our laboratory has previously identified a TGF-β-inducible early gene (TIEG) in normal human OB cells (hFOB) in which protein is 1) rapidly translocated from the cytoplasm to the nucleus and 2) rapidly induced (as is its mRNA) by TGF-β within 60 min after treatment in both primary and immortalized hFOB in culture (10.Subramaniam M.

TIEG mRNA was induced equally by all three isoforms of TGF-β, which is not surprising in view of the high binding affinity of the receptors for all isoforms of TGF-β. Our laboratory has reported that TIEG encodes a 480-amino acid protein (72 kDa) and has a unique N-terminal end, which distinguishes it from an early growth response-α (EGR-α) gene. We have previously reported that these two proteins are encoded in the same gene, but EGR-α is transcribed at much lower levels than TIEG in all tissues (12.Fautsch M.P. Vrabel A. Subramaniam M.

The zinc finger region of TIEG shows homology to the 3-zinc finger family of transcription factors such as Sp-1, Wilm's tumor, BTEB, EGR-1, and the Krüppel-like factors. The TIEG gene is localized on chromosome 8,q22.2, the same locus that contains genes related to myeloma and osteopetrosis (11.Subramaniam M. Hefferan T.E. Tau K. Peus D. Pittelkow M. Jalal S.

A mouse TIEG, termed mGIF for murine glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF)-inducible factor, has also been shown to be distributed in several regions of mouse brain and is rapidly induced by GDNF in a neuroblastoma cell line and in primary cultures of rat embryonic cortical neurons (14.Yajima S.

This paper also describes the phenotypic properties of these two lines to show that they mimic those of the TGF-β-treated parent osteosarcoma MG-63 compared with vector control cells or with untreated, nontransfected, parent MG-63 cells.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Culture and Northern AnalysesMG-63 human osteosarcoma cells were routinely maintained in DMEM/F-12 (1:1) (Sigma) containing 10% (v/v) FBS. For Northern blot analysis, the cells were grown to near confluency in 100-mm culture dishes. Total RNA was isolated from these cells using the guanidinium/cesium chloride method. Northern analyses were performed using total RNA (8–15 μg) as described previously (10.Subramaniam M. Harris S.A. Oursler M.J. Rasmussen K. Riggs B.L. Spelsberg T.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4907-4912Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). The blots were probed with 32P-labeled human TIEG cDNA, GAPDH cDNA, and 18 S ribosomal RNA as a control. The Northern blots were exposed to Kodak X-Omat AR film, and densitometry was determined using the NIH Image 1.47 program.Isolation of Stable Cell Lines with Vector Only or with TIEG Overexpression ConstructsThe 1.4-kilobase pair TIEG cDNA was cloned in-frame into the multiple cloning site of a pEBV His (Invitrogen) expression vector, which was thereafter named pEBV His-TIEG. MG-63 cells were stably transfected with either 10 μg of pEBV His-TIEG DNA or pEBV-His control vector using an electroporation method. The transfected cells were seeded onto 100-mm plates and allowed to grow for 48 h at 37 °C. The cells were then grown in selection medium containing hygromycin (100 μg/ml). The medium was replaced with selection medium every 2–3 days until antibiotic-resistant colonies developed. The colonies were then ring-cloned and propagated separately. The TIEG expression clones were characterized by analyzing the expression of TIEG mRNA and protein by Northern and immunoprecipitation, respectively.Immunoprecipitation of TIEG ProteinThe cells were seeded onto 100-mm plates and allowed to grow to near confluency. Prior to labeling, the medium was removed, and the cells were washed twice in methionine-free medium. The cells were pre-incubated in methionine-free medium for 1 h. Following pre-incubation, 750 μCi of [35S]methionine (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was added to each 100-mm plate, and the cells were labeled for 2 h at 37 °C. To harvest the cells, they were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 1 ml of radioimmune precipitation buffer containing 0.1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 0.5% (w/v) sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% (w/v) SDS, 0.15 mNaCl, and 5 mm Na/KPO4, pH 7.4. A protease inhibitor mixture was added to give final concentrations of the following protease inhibitors: 0.10 mg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 30 μl/ml of aprotinin, and 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate. The cells were sheared using a 20-guage needle, incubated on ice for 20 min, and centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was precleared with protein A-Sepharose beads. The precleared lysates were incubated with an equal amount of radioactivity with 5 μg of affinity-purified TIEG polyclonal antibody for 16 h at 4 °C. The immunocomplex was pelleted using protein A-Sepharose beads. The beads were resuspended in SDS-sample buffer and boiled, and the proteins were separated by 10% (w/v) SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The gels were soaked in Autofluor (National Diagnostics) and exposed to Kodak X-Omat AR film. Densitometry was performed using the NIH Image 1.47 program.Cell ProliferationThe cells were plated in 12-well plates at a density of 10,000 cells/cm2 in growth medium for 24 h. The cells were then serum-starved for 24 h by replacing the medium with DMEM/F-12 (1:1) containing 0.25% (w/v) BSA, and the parent control MG-63 cells were then treated with vehicle or 2 ng/ml TGF-β. The TIEG-6 and TIEG-7 cells were maintained in serum-containing medium. All cells were incubated with 1 μCi/ml [3H]thymidine for 24 h; [3H]thymidine incorporation was determined in the cells by trichloroacetic acid precipitation (20.Benz W.W. Getz M.J. Wells D.L.

Briefly, MG-63 cells were seeded onto 12-well tissue culture plates at 5,000 cells/cm2, and after 24 h the medium was changed to DMEM/F-12 (1:1) containing 0.25% (w/v) BSA with or without TGF-β (2 ng/ml) for the parent MG-63 control cells. The data are presented as the percent of control values,i.e. those from the untreated, nontransfected, parental MG-63 cells or from the vector-transfected control cells.Osteocalcin ProteinOsteocalcin protein was measured as reported previously using the NovoCalcin immunoassay (Metra Biosystems). Briefly, control and vector-transfected MG-63 cells, TIEG-6 cells, and TIEG-7 cells were seeded onto 12-well tissue culture plates at 40,000 cells/cm2. After 24 h, the medium was replaced with DMEM/F-12 (1:1) containing 0.25% (w/v) BSA. The parent MG-63 control cells were treated with or without TGF-β (2 ng/ml). After 72 h, the conditioned medium was collected, centrifuged to remove all debris, dialyzed in 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate, and analyzed for osteocalcin (21.Robinson J.A. Harris S.A. Riggs B.L.

Amplification reactions were terminated during the linear phase of amplification after 24 cycles (GAPDH) and 35 cycles (OC). PCR products were visualized on 1.5% agarose gels stained with ethidium bromide.Statistical AnalysisStudent's t test was used for statistical analysis.RESULTSTGF-β-treated and untreated MG-63 cells and vector control cells, as well as stably transfected TIEG-6 and TIEG-7 cells, were analyzed for TIEG mRNA steady state levels by Northern blotting and for TIEG protein levels by immunoprecipitation and SDS-gel electrophoresis. As reported previously in normal human osteoblast cells (10.Subramaniam M. Harris S.A. Oursler M.J. Rasmussen K. Riggs B.L. Spelsberg T.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4907-4912Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar) and shown in Fig.1 A for osteosarcoma cells, TGF-β induces TIEG mRNA levels in parent MG-63 cells to a maximum of 5-fold within 1 h post-treatment. Fig. 1 B shows the Northern blot of transfected cells wherein TIEG mRNA is increased in TIEG-6 and TIEG-7 cell lines, with only background levels detected in untreated, nontransfected, parental MG-63 cells or in vector-transfected control cells. To estimate TIEG protein levels, soluble protein was isolated from 35S-labeled cell extracts and immunoprecipitated with anti-TIEG protein antisera. Fig.2 A shows that TGF-β treatment of the nontransfected MG-63 cells rapidly increases TIEG protein levels by 1.8-fold. In Fig. 2 B, TIEG protein levels are shown to be 2- and 3-fold higher in TIEG-6- and TIEG-7-transfected cells, respectively, compared with the untreated, nontransfected, MG-63 parent control cells.Figure 2Analyses of TIEG protein levels in the MG-63, TIEG-6, and TIEG-7 cells. MG-63, TIEG-6, and TIEG-7 cells were labeled with [35S]methionine as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Panel A represents the nontransfected parental MG-63 cells treated and untreated with TGF-β, and Panel B shows the analyses of the parent MG-63 cells and the transfected, overexpressing TIEG-6/TIEG-7 cells. The cell lysates were immunoprecipitated using anti-TIEG polyclonal antibody 228, and the samples were separated on a 10% (w/v) SDS-polyacrylamide gel as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The TIEG immunoprecipitated protein is identified with an arrow. Densitometry was performed on the original blots as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The gels represent examples of analyses performed on three separate sets of cultures of each cell line.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The effect of overexpressing TIEG protein on the MG-63 cell proliferation was then examined. As shown in Fig.3 A, the parent MG-63 cells display a 50% inhibition of cell proliferation when treated with TGF-β. Similarly, Fig. 3 B shows that the overexpressing TIEG-6 and TIEG-7 cells display a more than 50% decrease in the rate of proliferation compared with the rates in the untreated, parent MG-63 cells, whereas the vector-transfected control cells show only a moderate reduction. The effect of overexpressing TIEG in the MG-63 cells on the expression of bone markers for the OB phenotype was then examined. As shown in Fig. 4 A, TGF-β-treated control MG-63 cells display a 2-fold induction of AP activity. In Fig. 4 B transfected TIEG-6 and TIEG-7 cells are shown to contain ∼1.4- and 1.8-fold enhanced AP activity, respectively, compared with the AP levels in the untreated, parent MG-63 cells or the vector control MG-63 cells. To determine whether TGF-β-induced endogenous TIEG protein acts differently or in addition to the overexpressed TIEG protein, we treated the TIEG-7 cells with TGF-β and assayed for AP levels. As shown in Fig. 4 B, although TGF-β showed strong effects on the AP levels in the nontransfected control or vector control MG-63 cells, no additional TGF-β-induced changes were detected in TIEG-7 cells.Figure 3Analyses of the cell proliferation rate in MG-63 and TIEG-6/7 cells.

Similarly, as shown in Fig. 5 B, the TIEG-6 and TIEG-7 cells display a significant decrease, i.e. 94 and 97%, respectively, in the levels of OC production compared with the parent MG-63 cells and the vector only control cells. To determine whether TIEG overexpression actually regulates OC protein at the level of gene expression, and as further support that TIEG overexpression mimics TGF-β action on osteoblast cells, we performed RT-PCR analysis of the MG-63, TIEG-6, and TIEG-7 cells. As shown in Fig.6, the TIEG-6 and TIEG-7 cells show reduced OC mRNA steady state levels compared with MG-63 cells, which correlates to the protein levels.Figure 5Analyses of the OC protein levels in MG-63 (A) and TIEG-6/7 cells (B).

The precipitated proteins were analyzed by Western blotting using anti-Smad 3 antibody on the samples precipitated by anti-TIEG antibody and vice versa. These studies failed to detect any interactions between TIEG and Smad 3.DISCUSSIONThe data presented in this paper support the hypothesis that TIEG may serve an important role as a primary participant in the TGF-β signaling pathway and/or as an early response gene for TGF-β in osteoblast cells. The data show that cell proliferation is inhibited, as are OC mRNA and protein levels, whereas the AP activity is increased in TIEG-6 or TIEG-7 cells compared with the vector control cells. These responses mimic the effects of TGF-β in MG-63 cells. Importantly, the overexpression displays a dose dependence in that the effects are increased as the concentrations of TIEG protein increases by 200 and 300% in stably transfected TIEG-6 and TIEG-7 cells, respectively. It should also be noted that the concentrations of TIEG protein in the TIEG-6 and TIEG-7 cells are lower, but more constant, compared with the higher, but transient, induction of TIEG protein levels in the TGF-β-treated (nontransfected) parental MG-63 cells. Interestingly, TGF-β treatments of TIEG-7 cells show no further responses in the AP levels, supporting the idea that TIEG levels in the transfected lines were saturating and that overexpressed TIEG in the latter can fully substitute for endogenous TGF-β-induced TIEG protein.The fact that TIEG mRNA and protein levels were previously shown to be rapidly induced after TGF-β treatment further supports a role for TIEG as an early response gene in the TGF-β signaling pathway (15.Eisch A.J.

TIEG has previously been implicated in tumor suppressor functions by inhibiting cell proliferation and inducing apoptosis in pancreatic carcinomas, hepatocarcinoma, and epithelial cells. In this regard, even the transient overexpression of TIEG seems to mimic the actions of TGF-β (16.Tau K. Hefferan T.E. Waters K.M. Robinson J.A. Subramaniam M. Riggs B.L. Spelsberg T.C.

However, TIEG represents the predominant species (>95%) in many tissues and cell types examined (12.Fautsch M.P. Vrabel A. Subramaniam M. Hefferan T.E. Spelsberg T.C. Wieben E.D.

Interestingly, TIEG is a cytonuclear protein in which the constitutive levels are rapidly translocated to the nucleus following TGF-β treatment. This translocation is followed by a rapid induction of the TIEGgene expression (11.Subramaniam M. Hefferan T.E. Tau K. Peus D. Pittelkow M. Jalal S. Riggs B.L. Roche P. Spelsberg T.C. J. Cell.

In vertebrates three additional β-subunits (β1i/LMP2, β2i/MECL1, and β5i/LMP7) can be synthesized and substituted for constitutive homologues (β1/delta, β2/Z, and β5/X) to yield immunoproteasomes, which are important for generating certain antigenic peptides. We have shown previously that when all six β-subunits are present, cooperative assembly mechanisms limit the diversity of proteasome populations. Specifically, LMP7 is incorporated preferentially over X into preproteasomes containing LMP2 and MECL1. We show here that the LMP7 propeptide is responsible for this preferential incorporation, and it also enables LMP7 to incorporate into proteasomes containing delta and Z. In contrast, the X propeptide restricts incorporation to proteasomes with delta and Z. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the LMP7 propeptide can function in trans when expressed on LMP2, and that its NH2-terminal and mid-regions are particularly critical for function. In addition to identifying a novel propeptide function, our results raise the possibility that one consequence of LMP7 incorporation into both immunoproteasomes and delta/Z proteasomes may be to increase the diversity of antigenic peptides that can be generated.

Walz J. Zuhl F. Seemuller E. Cell. 1998; 92: 367-380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1295) Google Scholar). They recognize and degrade ubiquitinated proteins, including those that are misfolded or damaged, as well as other regulatory proteins targeted for rapid turnover (2Coux O. Tanaka K. Goldberg A.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 801-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (2215) Google Scholar). Additionally, they are responsible for generating the majority of peptides presented by major histocompatibility complex class I molecules (3Rock K.L. Gramm C. Rothstein L. Clark K. Stein R. Dick L. Hwang D. Goldberg A.L. Cell. 1994; 78: 761-771Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2172) Google Scholar). The 26 S proteasome consists of a 20 S proteolytic core with a 19 S complex bound at one or both ends (4Peters J.M. Cejka Z. Harris J.R. Kleinschmidt J.A. Baumeister W. J. Mol.

Ichihara A. J. Struct. Biol. 1993; 111: 200-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The 20 S complex is composed of 28 subunits arranged in four stacked heptameric rings, with the outer two rings containing seven different α-type subunits (α1-α7) and the inner rings seven different β-type subunits (β1-β7) (6Lowe J. Stock D. Jap B. Zwickl P. Baumeister W. Huber R. Science. 1995; 268: 533-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (1363) Google Scholar, 7Groll M. Ditzel L. Lowe J. Stock D. Bochtler M. Bartunik H.D. Huber R. Nature. 1997; 386: 463-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (1923) Google Scholar). Three β subunits, delta (β1), Z (β2), and X (β5), possess catalytic activity (8Seemuller E. Lupas A. Stock D. Lowe J. Huber R. Baumeister W. Science. 1995; 268: 579-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar). In vertebrates there are three additional catalytic β-subunits, LMP2 (β1i), MECL1 (β2i), and LMP7 (β5i), whose expression is induced by the pro-inflammatory cytokine IFN-γ1 (9Monaco J.J. Nandi D. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1995; 29: 729-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Each inducible subunit can substitute for its homologous constitutive counterpart (LMP2 for delta, MECL1 for Z, and LMP7 for X) during proteasome assembly to generate immunoproteasomes (10Yang Y.

Two additional proteins induced by IFN-γ (PA28a and PA28b) oligomerize to form an 11 S regulatory complex that can associate with the 20 S core (13Dubiel W. Pratt G. Ferrell K. Rechsteiner M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22369-22377Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Ma C.P. Slaughter C.A. DeMartino G.N. J. Biol.

Demartino G.N. FEBS Lett. 1995; 366: 37-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). The precise role of the IFN-γ-inducible catalytic and regulatory subunits is not known. However, the prevailing concept is that immunoproteasomes capped with PA28 generate peptides whose length and COOH-terminal residue are better suited for binding to major histocompatibility complex class I molecules (16Rock K.L. Goldberg A.L. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1999; 17: 739-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (776) Google Scholar), and/or they increase the repertoire of peptides produced from a given antigen, and thus augment an immune response. In the fully assembled 20 S proteasome, each α- and β-subunit occupies a defined location relative to other subunits (7Groll M. Ditzel L. Lowe J. Stock D. Bochtler M. Bartunik H.D. Huber R. Nature. 1997; 386: 463-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (1923) Google Scholar, 17Kopp F. Hendil K.B. Dahlmann B. Kristensen P. Sobek A. Uerkvitz W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2939-2944Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Although the mechanism and orchestration of assembly is not well understood, it appears to occur in at least two stages, the first being the formation of a stable preproteasome complex (13–16 S) composed of an intact seven-member α-ring with at least three β subunits (Z/β2, C10-II/β3, and C7-I/β4) (18Frentzel S. Pesold-Hurt B. Seelig A. Kloetzel P.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 236: 975-981Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 19Nandi D. Woodward E. Ginsburg D.B. Monaco J.J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5363-5375Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Once the β ring is complete, two half-proteasomes dimerize at the β ring interface to form a 20 S complex. In yeast (and probably also in vertebrates (20Griffin, T. A., Slack, J. P., McClusky, T. S., Monaco, J. J., and Colbert, R. A. (2000) Mol. Cell. Biol. Res. Commun.3, in pressGoogle Scholar)), assembly is facilitated by ump1p, a constituent of the preproteasome complex that is degraded once assembly is complete (21Ramos P.C. Hockendorff J. Johnson E.S. Varshavsky A. Dohmen R.J. Cell. 1998; 92: 489-499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). In mammalian cells an added level of complexity results from the presence of IFN-γ-inducible catalytic β subunits. If assembly were random as many as 36 different proteasome subsets could form (22Nandi D. Jiang H. Monaco J.J. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 2361-2364PubMed Google Scholar). Instead, the IFN-γ-inducible subunits are incorporated cooperatively resulting predominantly (but not exclusively) in homogeneous subsets of immunoproteasomes and constitutive proteasomes (23Griffin T.A. Nandi D. Cruz M. Fehling H.J. Kaer L.V. Monaco J.J. Colbert R.A. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 97-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). Cooperative assembly appears to involve co-incorporation of LMP2 (β1i) and MECL1 (β2i) into preproteasomes (24Groettrup M. Standera S. Stohwasser R. Kloetzel P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8970-8975Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) with β3 and β4 (19Nandi D. Woodward E. Ginsburg D.B. Monaco J.J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5363-5375Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), thus excluding delta (β1) and Z (β2), with subsequent preferential incorporation of LMP7 (β5i) rather than X (β5) (23Griffin T.A. Nandi D. Cruz M. Fehling H.J. Kaer L.V. Monaco J.J. Colbert R.A. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 97-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). Since LMP2 and MECL1 are adjacent in the β ring their co-incorporation may be a result of physical interaction (25Schmidt M. Zantopf D. Kraft R. Kostka S. Preissner R. Kloetzel P.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 288: 117-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). However, the mature LMP7 subunit does not contact LMP2 or MECL1, either across one β ring or the interface of the two β rings, raising the question of how it is preferentially incorporated. Each proteolytic β subunit is expressed with an NH2-terminal propeptide that is removed autocatalytically during the final stages of assembly (26Chen P. Hochstrasser M. Cell. 1996; 86: 961-972Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar, 27Schmidtke G. Kraft R. Kostka S. Henklein P. Frommel C. Lowe J. Huber R. Kloetzel P.M. Schmidt M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6887-9898Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Propeptide removal frees the active site NH2-terminal nucleophile allowing the subunit to become proteolytically active. Thus, one proposed function of the propeptide is to prevent catalytic activity before the active site can be sequestered in the proteasome core. The propeptide also protects the NH2 terminus from acetylation and hence inactivation (28Arendt C.S. Hochstrasser M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3575-3585Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), and may serve as an intramolecular chaperone facilitating subunit folding (29Zuhl F. Seemuller E. Golbik R. Baumeister W. FEBS Lett. 1997; 418: 189-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The β5 propeptide is particularly important for proteasome assembly. In yeast, where there is only one β5 subunit, deletion of its propeptide disrupts assembly and ultimately viability (26Chen P. Hochstrasser M. Cell. 1996; 86: 961-972Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). Interestingly, viability is restored when ump1p is deleted, suggesting that an interaction between the β5 propeptide and ump1p is normally required for assembly to proceed (21Ramos P.C. Hockendorff J. Johnson E.S. Varshavsky A. Dohmen R.J. Cell. 1998; 92: 489-499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Similarly, in mammalian cells LMP7 (β5i) is not incorporated into proteasomes without its propeptide (30Cerundolo V. Kelly A. Elliott T. Trowsdale J. Townsend A. Eur. J. Immunol. 1995; 25: 554-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a variant of LMP7 (LMP7E1) which differs from the predominant form (LMP7E2) only in its propeptide (31Fruh K. Yang Y. Arnold D. Chambers J. Wu L. Waters J.B. Spies T. Peterson P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22131-22140Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), is not incorporated (32Yang Y. Fruh K. Ahn K. Peterson P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27687-27694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). In the work presented here, we explore the role of β5 propeptides in the assembly of mammalian proteasome populations. We define two regions of the LMP7 propeptide critical for efficient incorporation of LMP7, and show that this propeptide can function “intrans” when fused to the mature LMP2 subunit. Most importantly, we provide evidence that differences between the LMP7 (β5i) and X (β5) propeptides influence which population of assembling proteasomes will incorporate each subunit. Lymphoblastoid T2 cells (0.174 × CEMR) (33Salter R.D. Howell D.N. Cresswell P. Immunogenetics. 1985; 21: 235-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar) obtained from P. Cresswell (Yale University, New Haven, CT) were grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, l-glutamine, and antibiotics as described (23Griffin T.A. Nandi D. Cruz M.

MCP21 is a mouse monoclonal antibody that recognizes human C3 and immunoprecipitates both 20 S proteasomes and 13–16 S preproteasomes (34Hendil K.B. Kristensen P. Uerkvitz W. Biochem. J. 1995; 305: 245-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The hybridoma was obtained from the European Collection of Animal Cell Cultures (Salisbury, Wiltshire, UK). Polyclonal antisera recognizing LMP2 and LMP7 were from rabbits immunized with recombinant mouse subunits (19Nandi D. Woodward E. Ginsburg D.B. Monaco J.J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5363-5375Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Anti-X (P93250) is a rabbit polyclonal antiserum raised against human X, and was obtained from K. B. Hendil (August Krogh Institute, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark). The cDNAs encoding human LMP7 (LMP7E2) and LMP7E1 were expressed using the episomal vector pCEP4 (hygromycin) (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), and LMP2 was expressed using pCEP9 (neomycinr), as described (23Griffin T.A. Nandi D. Cruz M. Fehling H.J. Kaer L.V. Monaco J.J. Colbert R.A. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 97-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). pCEP9 was constructed from pREP9 and pCEP4, and is similar to pCEP4 except that it confers resistance to neomycin rather than hygromycin (23Griffin T.A. Nandi D. Cruz M. Fehling H.J. Kaer L.V. Monaco J.J. Colbert R.A. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 97-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). The human X cDNA was obtained from T. Spies (Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA). Altered forms of LMP7 and X (see below) were expressed in pCEP4, and altered forms of LMP2 in pCEP9. T2 cells were transfected with cDNAs in episomal vectors, and selected with G418 and/or hygromycin, as described (23Griffin T.A. Nandi D. Cruz M. Fehling H.J. Kaer L.V. Monaco J.J. Colbert R.A. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 97-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). To produce a T2 cell line overexpressing both LMP2 and LMP7 under one selection marker, LMP2 and LMP7 cDNAs were subcloned into pSG5 (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), and linearized constructs (25 μg each) were co-transfected with linearized pSV2.Neo (2.5 μg) (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) by electroporation (250 V and 500 microfarads). After selection with 0.8 mg (activity)/ml of G418, growth positive wells were expanded and screened for expression by immunoblotting. The cell line with the highest levels of LMP2 and LMP7 in immunoprecipitated proteasomes, and the lowest levels of delta and X (indicating replacement), were used for subsequent experiments. The ExoIII/Mung Bean Nuclease Deletion Kit (Stratagene) was used to generate LMP7 propeptide deletion mutants Δ+1, Δ-35, Δ-49, and Δ-67. The kit was used following the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, the full-length human LMP7 cDNA was cloned into pBluescript II KS (Stratagene) between KpnI and BamHI restriction sites. An oligonucleotide linker was inserted between KpnI and NheI upstream of the LMP7 start codon to provide 5′ susceptible (NheI) and 3′ resistant (KpnI) overhangs that enable unidirectional digestion by ExoIII. The linker provides a start codon and translation control sequence upstream of the resistant KpnI site. After varying periods of ExoIII digestion, mung bean nuclease was used to create ligatable blunt ends. Candidate LMP7 propeptide deletion mutants were sequenced to identify and characterize in-frame deletions. Selected constructs were then subcloned into pCEP4 usingNotI and BamHI restriction sites. Δ-69 and Δ-70 were generated using overlapping oligonucleotides extending from an internal EagI site at nucleotide 40 of the cDNA (the “A” of the ATG start codon represents nucleotide 1). Δ-3.LMP7 was produced by removing a fragment between an NcoI restriction site introduced at the start codon by site-directed mutagenesis, and the NcoI restriction site at nucleotide 210. A small linker fragment was inserted to restore the correct reading frame. Pro7(Δ-23:-11).LMP7 was generated by removing the DNA fragment between SmaI and NcoI restriction sites, and substituting an oligonucleotide linker encoding the necessary residues. To generate LMP7E1 with an LMP7E2 NH2-terminal region ((E2)7E1) the EagI to EcoRI fragment of LMP7E2 encoding 39 residues (Pro58-Phe20) was deleted and replaced with overlapping oligonucleotides encoding the comparable region of LMP7E1 (Pro56-Phe20). (X)7E1 was engineered by replacing the NH2-terminal coding region of (E2)7E1 (extending from the EagI restriction site) with an oligonucleotide sequence encoding Met59-Arg44of the X propeptide. The above constructs were generated in the pcDNA II vector (Invitrogen), and subcloned into pCEP4 with a reversed multiple cloning site using XhoI and HindIII restriction sites. LMP7 with an X propeptide (proX.LMP7) was generated by removing the XhoI to NcoI fragment beginning 30 nucleotides upstream of the start codon and ending at nucleotide 210, and replacing it with overlapping oligonucleotides encoding the X propeptide. X with an LMP7 propeptide (pro7.X) was engineered using the Seamless Cloning Kit (Stratagene) to directly clone the LMP7 propeptide cDNA fragment with the mature X cDNA. The COOH-terminal His-tags contain six histidines preceded by Arg·Gly·Ser. X.His and pro7.X.His were produced from X and pro7.X by cloning overlapping oligonucleotides into a BamHI restriction site at nucleotide 727. LMP7.His was generated by polymerase chain reaction using a 3′ primer that encoded the His-tag. ProX.LMP7.His was generated by removing the XhoI to NcoI fragment from LMP7.His, and replacing it with the same restriction fragment from proX.LMP7. To make pro7.LMP2 we first removed an internal NcoI site in the LMP2 cDNA without changing the encoded amino acids, using site-directed mutagenesis (Altered Sites Kit, Promega, Madison, WI). A new NcoI site was then introduced by site-directed mutagenesis at the same place as found in LMP7, just 5′ of the codon for Thr1. The LMP2 propeptide coding region was then replaced with the LMP7 propeptide using this new NcoI site and an upstream XhoI site. LMP2.His was made by polymerase chain reaction amplification of the LMP2 cDNA using a 3′ primer that inserted six Histidine codons before the stop codon. Every construct used in this study was sequenced to confirm anticipated changes, and to ensure that no other coding changes were introduced. The translational control sequences upstream of the start codon were preserved in all constructs. Cells were lysed in 20 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 10 mm EDTA, and 100 mm NaCl with 1% Nonidet P-40, and immunoprecipitations were performed on post-nuclear supernatants using 1 μg of antibody per 106 cells, followed by Protein G-Sepharose (250 μg/106 cells). Samples were separated on 12.5% SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted using proteasome subunit-specific antibodies or antisera as described (23Griffin T.A. Nandi D. Cruz M. Fehling H.J. Kaer L.V. Monaco J.J. Colbert R.A. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 97-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). Secondary antibodies used for visualization were alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit or goat anti-mouse IgG. For nickel precipitation, His-tagged proteasomes were precipitated with 50–100 μl of Ni2+-NTA-agarose (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) per 107 cells. Proteasomes were then eluted from Ni2+-NTA-agarose with 250 mm imidazole and boiled in 6 × SDS sample buffer (23Griffin T.A. Nandi D. Cruz M. Fehling H.J. Kaer L.V. Monaco J.J. Colbert R.A. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 97-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). Gel electrophoresis and protein blotting was performed as described above except an ECF substrate (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was used. Relative chemifluorescence was quantitated using the Storm 860 PhosphorImaging system and ImageQuant software (version 1.2) (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). For each protein band the volume in pixels was measured, and the background from an adjacent gel region was subtracted. In separate experiments we determined that sequential 2-fold sample dilution reduced the signal (number of pixels) approximately 2-fold, indicating linearity in the range of interest. Previous studies have shown that deletion of the entire LMP7 propeptide prevents incorporation of the subunit into 20 S proteasomes (30Cerundolo V. Kelly A. Elliott T. Trowsdale J. Townsend A. Eur. J. Immunol. 1995; 25: 554-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). We were interested in whether certain regions of the propeptide might be more important for function than others. To test this, we generated a series of partial deletions from the NH2 terminus, ranging from removal of one residue (Δ-70) to full propeptide truncation (Δ+1) (Fig.1 A). The NH2-terminal methionine codon was preserved in all constructs. Each deletion mutant was expressed alone and with LMP2 in T2 cells, which lack endogenous LMP2 and LMP7 (33Salter R.D. Howell D.N. Cresswell P. Immunogenetics. 1985; 21: 235-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar, 35Spies T. Bresnahan M. Bahram S. Arnold D. Blanck G. Mellins E. Pious D. DeMars R. Nature. 1990; 348: 744-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar). Proteasomes were immunoprecipitated from cell lysates using MCP21, a monoclonal antibody that recognizes C3, a proteasome α-type subunit (34Hendil K.B. Kristensen P. Uerkvitz W. Biochem. J. 1995; 305: 245-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Following immunoprecipitation, proteasomes were denatured and subunits separated by SDS-PAGE. The presence of specific subunits was determined by immunoblotting with subunit-specific antisera. Large deletions of the propeptide (to residue +1, −3, or −35) dramatically reduce LMP7 incorporation. This is apparent when these altered forms of LMP7 are either expressed alone (Fig. 1 A, lane 1 of each group), or when co-expressed with LMP2 (lane 3 of each group). In contrast, removal of a smaller region (to −70 or −49) does not prevent incorporation, although the efficiency is reduced compared with full-length LMP7. Deletion of two or four amino acid residues to −69 and −67, respectively, has an effect similar to removal of a single residue (to −70) (data not shown). The LMP7 subunit is incorporated preferentially over X into proteasomes containing LMP2 and MECL1 (23Griffin T.A. Nandi D. Cruz M. Fehling H.J. Kaer L.V. Monaco J.J. Colbert R.A. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 97-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). It is also incorporated into delta/Z proteasomes when LMP2 is absent. That this latter population might also form in the presence of LMP2 is suggested by pre-clearing experiments using anti-LMP2 (36Brown M.G. Driscoll J. Monaco J.J. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 1193-1204PubMed Google Scholar), and greater overall incorporation of LMP7 when co-expressed with LMP2 (23Griffin T.A. Nandi D. Cruz M. Fehling H.J. Kaer L.V. Monaco J.J. Colbert R.A. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 97-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar, 31Fruh K. Yang Y. Arnold D. Chambers J. Wu L. Waters J.B. Spies T. Peterson P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22131-22140Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 1 A). To confirm this directly we tagged LMP2 with polyhistidine at the COOH terminus (LMP2.His) where it should not interfere with incorporation (7Groll M. Ditzel L. Lowe J. Stock D. Bochtler M. Bartunik H.D. Huber R. Nature. 1997; 386: 463-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (1923) Google Scholar, 37Reits E.A.J. Benham A.M. Plougastel B. Neefjes J. Trowsdale J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6087-6094Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar), allowing us to selectively remove LMP2-containing immunoproteasomes from the entire pool of proteasomes using Ni2+-NTA-agarose. Indeed, when LMP7 and LMP2.His are co-expressed, LMP7 is found not only in LMP2-containing proteasomes removed by nickel precipitation (Fig.1 B), but also in proteasomes lacking LMP2 that can be precipitated with MCP21 after exhaustive removal of the His-tagged population (data not shown). To determine whether partially deleted forms of LMP7 are still incorporated into LMP2-containing immunoproteasomes, we used nickel precipitation to isolate this population from cells co-expressing Δ-49.LMP7 and LMP2.His. As shown in Fig. 1 B, this population contains LMP7, indicating that the partially truncated form is incorporated into immunoproteasomes. Taken together, these results suggest that removal of short segments from the NH2 terminus of the LMP7 propeptide reduces subunit incorporation slightly, while further deletion of the region between residues Ser49 and Arg35 completely abolishes it. Notably, these deletions do not appear to selectively reduce incorporation of LMP7 into immunoproteasomes. In yeast, the β5 subunit propeptide expressed as a separate polypeptide (in trans) restores incorporation of the truncated β5 subunit (26Chen P. Hochstrasser M. Cell. 1996; 86: 961-972Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). Using a similar approach with the LMP7 propeptide, we did not observe any incorporation of truncated LMP7 (Δ+1, Δ-3, or Δ-35) in T2 cells (data not shown). However, when the LMP7 propeptide is expressed as a fusion protein on LMP2 (replacing the LMP2 propeptide), incorporation of these truncated forms of LMP7 is at least partially restored (Fig. 1 A, lane 2, of each group). Furthermore, this form of LMP2 is incorporated (data not shown), and replaces the constitutive homologous β subunit (delta), as shown previously by Schmidtke et al. (27Schmidtke G. Kraft R. Kostka S. Henklein P. Frommel C. Lowe J. Huber R. Kloetzel P.M. Schmidt M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6887-9898Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). These results demonstrate that the LMP7 propeptide can function in transwhen expressed on another β subunit. Its inability to function as a separate polypeptide may be due to ineffective competition with the endogenous β5 subunit (X). We have attempted to express LMP2, truncated LMP7, and the LMP7 propeptide together so that a pool of preproteasomes dependent on LMP7 for maturation would be created. However, these experiments have not been successful, at least in part due to difficulties obtaining stable triple transfectants. The two forms of LMP7 2Throughout this article all reference to LMP7 implies LMP7E2 except where specified. that the result from alternative first exon use (LMP7E1 and LMP7E2) encode polypeptides that differ only in the NH2-terminal two thirds of their propeptides (Fig. 2 A), yet LMP7E1 is not incorporated into proteasomes (23Griffin T.A. Nandi D. Cruz M. Fehling H.J. Kaer L.V. Monaco J.J. Colbert R.A. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 97-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar, 32Yang Y. Fruh K. Ahn K. Peterson P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27687-27694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). The NH2-terminal regions of the two functional β5 propeptides (LMP7E2 and X) are homologous, and yet quite different from the same region of LMP7E1 (Fig. 2 A). Consequently, to test whether this region confers functionality, we replaced the NH2-terminal region of LMP7E1 with residues from LMP7E2 or X to produce (E2)7E1 and (X)7E1, respectively (Fig. 2 B). Both of these proteins are incorporated into proteasomes, although not as efficiently as LMP7E2 (Fig. 2 B). There appears to be enhanced incorporation when they are co-expressed with LMP2, suggesting incorporation into immunoproteasomes. This is further supported by enhanced incorporation of LMP2 under these same conditions (data not shown). Since the LMP7 and X propeptides differ in length by 13 amino acids (Fig. 2 A), and X is primarily restricted to constitutive proteasomes, we questioned whether the ability of LMP7 to incorporate into immunoproteasomes was due to its longer propeptide. To test this we deleted 13 residues (Pro23 through Glu11) closer to the mature subunit, preserving the NH2-terminal region and mid-portion of the propeptide. In contrast to other deletions, this has no effect on overall LMP7 incorporation nor does it reduce LMP2 incorporation (Fig. 2 C), implying that this region closer to the mature subunit is dispensable. Taken together, the results in Figs. 1 and 2 suggest that there are at least two regions of the LMP7"

Of particular interest to neutrophil physiology are class I PI3Ks, which are further divided into class IA and class IB and which are involved in receptor-induced cellular responses. Class IA includes heterodimers consisting of a regulatory p85 subunit (α or β) and one of the catalytic p110 subunit (α, β, or δ). At present, class IB includes only one member, p110γ, which, possibly in association with a regulatory p101 subunit (23Stephens L.R. Eguinoa A. Erdjumentbromage H. Lui M. Cooke F. Coadwell J.

On the other hand, it is well established that the formation of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 stimulated by fMet-Leu-Phe is inhibited by pertussis toxin (1Traynor-Kaplan A.E. Thompson B.L. Harris A.L. Taylor P.

Furthermore, it has also been shown that the introduction of GTP into permeabilized neutrophils led to the accumulation of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 (32Stephens L. Jackson T. Hawkins P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17162-17172Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These two sets of data suggest that heterotrimeric GTP-binding proteins regulate the formation of the highly phosphorylated phosphoinositides. It is presently unclear, however, whether the implication of heterotrimeric GTP binding proteins in this response is direct or indirect. The present study was initiated to examine the potential involvement of the class IB PI3K p110γ in the responses of native human neutrophils isolated from the peripheral blood to chemotactic factors. To test this possibility as directly as possible, the effects of fMet-Leu-Phe and interleukin-8 (IL-8) on the activity and subcellular distribution of immunoprecipitated p110γ were examined. The results obtained provide evidence that chemotactic factors rapidly and transiently stimulate the activity of p110γ in a pertussis toxin-sensitive manner at a time when fMet-Leu-Phe does not increase the PI3K activity associated with p85 immunoprecipitates. Furthermore, neutrophil stimulation with chemotactic factors results in a translocation of p110γ to a particulate, membrane-enriched fraction of these cells.

Neutrophil suspensions (100 μl of 4 × 107 cells/ml) were added to an equal volume of boiling 2× Laemmli sample buffer (1× is 62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 4% SDS, 5% β-mercaptoethanol, 8.5% glycerol, 2.5 mm orthovanadate, 10 mmparanitro-phenylphosphate, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.025% bromphenol blue) and boiled for 7 min. Samples were then subjected to 7.5–20% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to Immobilon polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore). Immunoblotting was performed using the anti-p110γ antiserum at a final dilution of 1/1000 and revealed using the ECL detection system as described previously (34Naccache P.H. Gilbert C. Barabé F.

Leukocyte Biol. 1997; 62: 901-910Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Briefly, the lysates were filtered through sephadex G-10 columns to remove the denaturing agents. The filtered lysates were precleared with protein A-Sepharose at 4 °C for 30 min in the presence of 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.05% bovine serum albumin, 2 mmorthovanadate, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin. The samples were then immunoprecipitated using 250 μg of the anti-p110γ antiserum or 5 μg of anti-p85 antibodies for 90 min at 4 °C. Fifty μl of protein A-Sepharose-conjugated beads were added then, and the samples were incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. The agarose beads were collected and washed four times with lysis buffer containing 1% Nonidet P-40 and no SDS or β-mercaptoethanol. Sample buffer (40 μl, 2×) was added to the beads, which were boiled for 7 min. The samples were then electrophoresed as described above. The membranes were immunoblotted with the anti-p110γ serum (final dilution 1/1000) as described previously (34Naccache P.H. Gilbert C. Barabé F. Al-Shami A. Mahana W. Bourgoin S.G. J.

Briefly 8 × 107human neutrophils/ml were resuspended in Hanks' balanced salt solution and incubated at room temperature with 1 mm DFP for 30 min. 500 μl of cells were prewarmed at 37 °C and then stimulated with 100 nm fMet-Leu-Phe or IL-8 in the presence or absence of inhibitors (preincubation with wortmannin 200 nm for 5 min or pertussis toxin, 1 μg/ml for 2 h). The stimulation was quickly stopped by the addition of ice-cold buffer I (phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mmCaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 100 μm Na3VO4). The samples were centrifuged and then washed twice in ice-cold buffer II (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 137 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 100 μmNa3VO4). The pellets were lysed quickly in 1 ml of ice-cold buffer III (1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, HEPES 50 mm, pH 7.4, 137 mm NaCl, 1 mmCaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 2 mmNa3VO4, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaF, 10 mmNa4P2O7, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin) and left on ice for 15 min before being centrifuged for 10 min at 13,000 × g at 4 °C. The supernatants were incubated for 1 h at 4 °C on a rotating wheel with the specific antibodies (anti-p110γ or anti-P85, Upstate Biotechnology) before the addition of 50 μl of protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for an additional hour. The beads were then washed 3 times with buffer IV (phosphate-buffered saline, 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 100 μmNa3VO4), 3 more times with buffer V (100 μm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 500 mm LiCl, 100 μm Na3VO4) and finally twice with buffer VI (10 μm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mmNaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 100 μmNa3VO4). 10 μl of PtdIns (2 mg/ml phosphatidylinositol, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EGTA) was sonicated for 10 min, added to 50 μl of buffer VI and 10 μl of 100 mm MgCl2, and mixed with the beads for 10 min on ice. The reaction was initiated by adding 10 μl of 440 μm ATP containing 30 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (NEN Life Science Products, 3000 Ci/mmol) and incubated for 15 min at 30 °C with constant shaking. Twenty μl of 1 n HCl was added to stop the reaction, and PtdIns(3)P was extracted by the addition of 200 μl chloroform/methanol (1:1, v/v). The samples were centrifuged, and 75 μl of the lower organic phase was applied onto an oxalate-treated silica gel 60 plate (Merck), which was developed in 2-propanol-2 n acetic acid (2:1, v/v). The plates were dried and the products of the kinase reaction visualized by x-ray film at −80 °C or with a bio-imaging analyzer (Fujifilm). Total RNA from human neutrophils was purified as follows. Briefly, cell pellets were lysed in 2 ml of RNAzol B before the addition of 200 μl of chloroform. The mixture was vortexed for 1 min and placed at 4 °C for 5 min before being centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The aqueous layer was then mixed with an equal volume of isopropanol and incubated at 4 °C for 15 min before being centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. the supernatant was then discarded, and the RNA pellet was dried and then solubilized in diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated H2O. Ten μg of total RNA diluted in 45 μl of a solution of 1% diethyl pyrocarbonate in ddH2O were heated at 65 °C for 10 min. The reverse transcription reaction was then performed for 90 min at 37 °C in 80 μl of a solution of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 75 mm KCl, 15 mm MgCl2, 0.01 m dithiothreitol, 0.66 μm random hexamer primers, 0.66 μmoligo(dT)12–18 primers, 1 mmdeoxyribonucleotides, 0.35 units/μl RNAsin, and 1 unit/μl Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase. The reaction was stopped by heating the mixture at 95 °C for 5 min. PCR assays were performed as described previously (36Tessier P.A. Naccache P.H. Clark-Lewis I. Gladue R.P. Neote K.S. McColl S.R. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 3595-3602PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 5 μl of reverse-transcribed RNA was added to a solution to obtain a final concentration of 50 mm KCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9.0, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.2 mm deoxyribonucleotides, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 0.05 units/ml Taqpolymerase, and 1 pmol/μl each sense and antisense specific primers. The primer sequences are as follows: hup110γ PI3Kf GTGGTGCTGAGAGAGGACAA, hup110γ PI3Kr CTATCAGCAGCAGGTTCACA (1.38-kilobase fragment); hup110γ PI3Kf ACAGATTCTACGAATCATGG, hup110γ PI3Kr GCATTCCTGTCATCAGCATC (0.585-kilobase fragment); GAPDHf TCCTTGGAGGCCATGTAGGCCAT, GAPDHr TGATGACATCAAG-AAGGTGGTGAAG. The sequence of PCR amplification was one cycle of denaturation at 95 °C for 2 min followed by annealing at 56 °C for 30 s and extension at 72 °C for 1 min. This cycle was followed by 30 s at 95 °C, 30 s at 56 °C, and 1 min at 72 °C, repeated 38 times. The PCR reaction was sampled every 5 cycles from cycle 25 to 40, inclusively. The samples were migrated on a 2% agarose gel, stained with ethidium bromide, and compared for intensity. Neutrophils (4 × 107 cells/ml) were treated with 1 mmDFP for 30 min at room temperature. The cell suspensions were centrifuged and resuspended in Hanks' balanced salt solution at the same cell concentration. The cells were pre-heated for 5 min at 37 °C and stimulated with fMet-Leu-Phe (10−7m) or an equal volume of the diluent (Me2SO) for 5, 10, or 15 s. The incubations were stopped by sonication for 20 s. One ml of cold KCl-HEPES relaxation buffer (100 mm KCl, 50 mmHEPES, 5 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2,0.5 mm EGTA, 2.5 μg/ml aprotinin, 2.5 μg/ml leupeptin, 2.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm DFP, pH 7.2) was added. The cell suspensions were centrifuged for 7 min at 700 × g. Unbroken cells and nuclei were discarded and the supernatants ultracentrifuged at 180,000 × g for 45 min in a Beckman TL-100 ultracentrifuge using a TL-100.4 rotor. The membrane pellets were washed once, resuspended in a 1-ml volume of ice-cold relaxation buffer, and sonicated for 5 s. Pellets of 4 × 107 cells were resolved on 7.5–20% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gradients and transferred to Immobilon polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The membranes were blotted using the anti-p110γ antiserum, and the labeled proteins were revealed using the ECL detection system. Differences between control, unstimulated, and stimulated conditions were tested using the Wilcoxon rank sum test. Significance was considered to be achieved when the p values were less than 0.01. Although the presence of p85/p110 PI3K in human neutrophils has been firmly and repeatedly demonstrated, that of p110γ is much less well established (37Kular G. Loubtchenkov M. Swigart P. Whatmore J. Ball A. Cockcroft S. Wetzker R. Biochem. J. 1997; 325: 299-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). A polyclonal antibody to a peptide sequence derived from amino acids 745–756 of p110γ, as reported by Stoyanov et al. (25Stoyanov B. Volinia S. Hanck T. Rubio I. Loubtchenkov M. Malek D. Stoyanova S. Van-Haesebroeck B. Dhand R. Nurnberg B. Gierschik P. Seedorf K. Hsuan J.J. Waterfield M.D. Wetzker R. Science. 1995; 269: 690-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar), was raised and used in immunoblotting and immunoprecipitation protocols to examine the expression of p110γ in human neutrophils directly. As shown in Fig. 1 A, this antibody detected closely spaced protein bands at an approximate molecular mass of 110 kDa. This detection was specific in that the staining was displaced by an excess of the immunizing peptide and was not present if the p110γ antiserum was omitted from the immunoprecipitation step (data not shown). The polyclonal antibody was also able to immunoprecipitate p110γ under reducing and denaturing conditions (Fig. 1 B). The efficiency of the immunoprecipitation was not altered in cell lysates derived from cells stimulated by fMet-Leu-Phe. On the other hand, the immunoprecipitation was abrogated if the antiserum was first neutralized with the immunizing peptide. It should be noted, however, that the antiserum was significantly less efficient at immunoprecipitating p110γ under native, nondenaturing conditions (data not shown). Finally, PCR amplification revealed the presence of fragments of the expected sizes of 1377 and 585 base pairs using primers derived from the sequence of human p110γ (Fig. 1 C). Neutrophils were stimulated by two separate chemotactic factors that interact with distinct G protein-coupled receptors, namely fMet-Leu-Phe and IL-8, for various times ranging from 5 s to 1 min. These times correspond to those during which the levels of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 have previously been reported to rise following the stimulation of human neutrophils by fMet-Leu-Phe (maximal levels attained after about 10–15 s) (1Traynor-Kaplan A.E.

The cells were then lysed and immunoprecipitated, using the anti-p110γ antiserum or an anti-p85 antibody, and the PI3K activities present in the immunoprecipitates were assayed. The results of representative experiments using fMet-Leu-Phe are illustrated in Fig. 2. These data show that fMet-Leu-Phe (10−7m) very rapidly induced an increase in the formation of PtdIns(3)P (using PtdIns as substrate). This increase was detectable within 5 s of stimulation with the chemotactic factor, reached a maximum at 5–10 s, and progressively decreased thereafter. The data from several experiments are pooled in Fig. 2, lower panel. These demonstrate that the increase of the activity of immunoprecipitated p110γ was statistically significant as rapidly as 5 s after the addition of the chemotactic factor. Control experiments indicated that no PI3K activity was recovered if the antiserum was omitted from the immunoprecipitation step or if the anti-p110γ antiserum was neutralized with the immunizing peptide (data not shown). Similar results were observed if the cells were stimulated with IL-8 (Fig.3). Again, detectable increases in the formation of PtdIns(3)P were detected within 5 s of the addition of the agonist, and maximal levels of activity were reached at 10–15 s post-stimulation. The formation of PtdIns(3)P induced by incubation of PtdIns with the immunoprecipitates was abrogated if the cells were pre-incubated in the presence of 50 nm wortmannin before being stimulated with fMet-Leu-Phe (Fig.4), thereby providing additional evidence for the involvement of a PI3K activity in the monitored reaction (39Arcaro A. Wymann M.P. Biochem. J. 1993; 296: 297-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (1051) Google Scholar,40Okada T. Sakuma L. Fukui Y. Hazeki O. Ui M. J. Biol.

In additional experiments, we also tested the potential effects of granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor (1 nm) on the activity of p110γ. The growth factor did not stimulate the activity of p110γ (activity relative to control, unstimulated cells: 125 ± 19, 94 ± 14, and 93 ± 27% at 5"

Recent studies demonstrate that when GAP activity is assayed in a membrane-free environment by employing an amino-terminal truncation mutant of ARF1 (Δ17-ARF1) and a catalytic fragment of the ARF GTPase-activating protein GAP1, GTP hydrolysis is strongly stimulated by coatomer (Goldberg, J., (1999) Cell 96, 893–902). In this study, we investigated the role of coatomer in GTP hydrolysis on ARF1 both in solution and in a phospholipid environment. When GTP hydrolysis was assayed in solution using Δ17-ARF1, coatomer stimulated hydrolysis in the presence of the full-length GAP1 as well as with a Saccharomyces cerevisiae ARF GAP (Gcs1) but had no effect on hydrolysis in the presence of the phosphoinositide dependent GAP, ASAP1. Using wild-type myristoylated ARF1 loaded with GTP in the presence of phospholipid vesicles, GAP1 by itself stimulated GTP hydrolysis efficiently, and coatomer had no additional effect. Disruption of the phospholipid vesicles with detergent resulted in reduced GAP1 activity that was stimulated by coatomer, a pattern that resembled Δ17-ARF1 activity. Our findings suggest that in the biological membrane, the proximity between ARF1 and its GAP, which results from mutual binding to membrane phospholipids, may be sufficient for stimulation of ARF1 GTPase activity.

Recently, additional ARF GAPs belonging to two subfamilies were identified in mammalian cells. GIT1 is a 95-kDa protein from rat that interacts with GRK2 and regulates β2-adrenergic receptor internalization (22Premont R.T. Claing A. Vitale N. Freeman J.L. Pitcher J.A. Patton W.A. Moss J. Vaughan M. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14082-14087Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar) while its mouse homologues (Cat1/2) are involved in CDC42/Rac/Pak signaling (23Bagrodia S. Bailey D. Lenard Z. Hart M. Guan J.L.

The second subfamily consists of large multidomain proteins represented by ASAP1 and PAP (24Brown M.T. Andrade J. Radhakrishna H. Donaldson J.G. Cooper J.A. Randazzo P.A. Mol. Cell.

Additionally, the proteins interact with non-receptor tyrosine kinases through a proline-rich Src homology 3 (SH3)-binding domain. Despite distinct subcellular sites of action, all GAPs that have been described so far are highly active on ARF1 in vitro. Whether there is redundancy in the action of mammalian ARF GAPs in vivo remains to be established. Recently, Goldberg (27Goldberg J. Cell. 1999; 96: 893-902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar) presented the crystal structure of a 130-amino acid catalytic fragment of GAP1 co-crystallized with the GDP-bound form of an ARF1 mutant lacking the first 17 amino acids (Δ17-ARF1). A unique feature of this structure is that switch I of ARF1, thought to comprise part of the “effector” site mediating coatomer interaction (6Zhao L. Helms J.B. Brunner J. Wieland F.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14198-14203Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 28Zhao L. Helms J.B. Brugger B. Harter C. Martoglio B. Graf R. Brunner J. Wieland F.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4418-4423Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), does not participate in GAP binding. This model was supported by biochemical data showing that coatomer dramatically stimulates GTP hydrolysis on Δ17-ARF1, which suggests that both coatomer and GAP can simultaneously bind to ARF1. Interestingly, coatomer-dependent stimulation of GAP1 activity was inhibited by a coatomer-interacting peptide of one member of the p24 transmembrane Golgi proteins (29Goldberg J. Cell. 2000; 100: 671-679Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Based on structural and functional observations, Goldberg suggested (27Goldberg J. Cell. 1999; 96: 893-902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar) that the “catalytic arginine finger” mechanism that is essential for catalysis of GTP hydrolysis by Ras and Rho GAPs may not operate in ARF GAP and that coatomer rather than GAP may contribute a catalytic residue for the GTPase reaction. The model of Goldberg was recently challenged by Mandiyan et al. (30Mandiyan V. Andreev J. Schlessinger J. Hubbard S.R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6890-6898Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) who reported that the crystal structure of a different ARF GAP, PAPβ, may not be compatible with the structure of the ARF1·GAP1 complex described by Goldberg (27Goldberg J. Cell. 1999; 96: 893-902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Our laboratory in addition to others (17Makler V. Cukierman E. Rotman M. Admon A. Cassel D. J. Biol.

Unlike Δ17-ARF1, which does not depend on phospholipids for GTP binding, the binding of the nucleotide to full-length ARF1 requires phospholipids. These act by interacting with and stabilizing the amphipathic amino-terminal peptide that becomes solvent-exposed in the GTP state (31Antonny B. Beraud-Dufour S. Chardin P. Chabre M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4675-4684Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar, 32Goldberg J.

Chem. 1999; 274: 37629-37636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Consequently, GTP hydrolysis on myristoylated ARF1 has been assayed in the presence of phospholipid vesicles whose lipid composition may influence GAP activity (34Antonny B. Huber I. Paris S. Chabre M. Cassel D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30848-30851Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). It was therefore of interest to investigate the relative contribution of coatomer and phospholipids to GAP activity using normal myristoylated ARF1 as substrate. We report that contrary to its effect on Δ17-ARF1, coatomer does not affect GAP activity with myristoylated ARF1 bound to phospholipid vesicles. This as well as additional findings indicate that coatomer is not directly involved in the catalysis of GTP hydrolysis. We propose that both coatomer and phospholipids may facilitate GTP hydrolysis by bringing GAP into proximity with its substrate ARF1. [α-32P]GTP (800 Ci/mmol) and [γ-32P]GTP (3000 Ci/mmol) were obtained from NEN Life Science Products, and Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid was from Qiagen, Valencia, CA. Phosphoinositides were purchased from Sigma (P-6023). Coatomer was purified from rabbit liver according to Pavel et al. (35Pavel J. Harter C. Wieland F.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2140-2145Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The following proteins were prepared from Escherichia coli expression systems: myristoylated ARF1 (36Franco M. Chardin P. Chabre M. Paris S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24531-24534Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), His6-tagged ARF1 lacking the first 17 amino acids (Δ17-ARF1) (27Goldberg J. Cell. 1999; 96: 893-902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar), the Sec7 domain of ARNO (10Chardin P. Paris S. Antonny B. Robineau S. Beraud-Dufour S. Jackson C.L. Chabre M. Nature. 1996; 384: 481-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar), GAP1-(1–257) that contains the first 257 amino acids (18Cukierman E. Huber I. Rotman M. Cassel D. Science. 1995; 270: 1999-2002Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar),S. cerevisiae Gcs1p (20Poon P.P. Wang X. Rotman M. Huber I. Cukierman E. Cassel D. Singer R.A. Johnston G.C. Proc. Natl.

Andrade J. Radhakrishna H. Donaldson J.G. Cooper J.A. Randazzo P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7038-7051Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Full-length GAP1 with a His6 extension at the amino terminus was expressed in insect cells using a baculovirus expression vector and purified as described previously (37Huber, I., Rotman, M., Pick, E., Makler, V., Rothem, L., Cukierman, E., and Cassel, D. (2000) Methods Enzymol., in pressGoogle Scholar). GAP 1 mutants were generated by polymerase chain reaction and cloned into the pKM260 T7 polymerase-driven bacterial expression vector as described previously (18Cukierman E. Huber I. Rotman M. Cassel D. Science. 1995; 270: 1999-2002Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). All mutant GAPs were derived from constructs encoding the first 257 amino acids because this part of the protein in wild-type GAP1 retains full GAP catalytic activity, and moreover, longer constructs cannot be expressed in E. coli (18Cukierman E. Huber I. Rotman M. Cassel D. Science. 1995; 270: 1999-2002Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Proteins were expressed in DE3 lysogens of strain BL21 by induction for 2.5 h at 37 °C in the presence of 0.4 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. Bacterial pellets were extracted with 6 m guanidine hydrochloride, and proteins were purified by Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid chromatography according to the manufacturer's instructions using 6m guanidine hydrochloride in 0.1 m sodium phosphate, 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, throughout the purification. The Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid eluate was diluted with 6m guanidine hydrochloride to a protein concentration of 3–5 mg/ml and was supplemented with 5 mm dithiothreitol. The eluate was dialyzed overnight against 50 mm NaCl, 25 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mm dithiothreitol with one buffer change. The dialysate was cleared by centrifugation, and proteins were purified by Resource-Q anion exchange chromatography using a linear NaCl gradient in 25 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mm dithiothreitol. GTP hydrolysis on myristoylated ARF1 was assayed essentially as described previously (17Makler V. Cukierman E. Rotman M. Admon A. Cassel D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5232-5237Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). ARF1 was first loaded with [α-32P]GTP in the presence of phospholipid vesicles (0.4 μm) containing 40% phosphatidylcholine, 30% phosphatidylethanolamine, and 30% phosphatidylserine prepared as described in Ref. 34Antonny B. Huber I. Paris S. Chabre M. Cassel D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30848-30851Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar. The loading mixture contained 4 μmmyristoylated ARF1, 25 mm MOPS, pH 7.4, 100 mmKCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EDTA, 0.5 μm [α-32P]GTP, and 1 mg/ml liposomes. In some experiments, liposomes were replaced with a mixture containing 30 mm dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine (DMPC) and 1% sodium cholate (17Makler V. Cukierman E. Rotman M. Admon A. Cassel D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5232-5237Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Loading proceeded for 15 min at 30 °C and was terminated by the addition of 2 mm MgCl2. Loading efficiency with respect to [α-32P]GTP was typically 60–75%. GAP assays contained 40 nm[α-32P]GTP-loaded ARF1 (approximately 1:10 dilution of the loading reaction), 5 mm MgCl2, 25 mm MOPS, pH 7.4, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm ATP with an ATP-regenerating system (5 mmphosphocreatine and 50 μg/ml creatine phosphokinase) in a final volume of 10 μl. Reactions were preincubated for 5 min at room temperature with or without coatomer and were initiated by the addition of different concentrations of GAP. Reactions proceeded for 15 min and were terminated by boiling for 30 s. GTP hydrolysis was determined by thin layer chromatography on polyethyleneimine cellulose (17Makler V. Cukierman E. Rotman M. Admon A. Cassel D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5232-5237Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), and data are presented as the percentage of ARF-bound GTP that was converted to GDP. Hydrolysis of GTP on Δ17-ARF1 was assayed by a modification of the assay described by Goldberg (27Goldberg J. Cell. 1999; 96: 893-902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Δ17-ARF1 was loaded with [γ-32P]GTP in the presence of the guanine nucleotide exchange protein ARNO as described previously (27Goldberg J. Cell. 1999; 96: 893-902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). GAP assays contained 400 nm GTP-bound Δ17-ARF1, 5 mmMgCl2, 25 mm MOPS, pH 7.4, and 0.5 mm 5′-adenylyl-β,γ-imidodiphosphate (AMP-PNP) in a final volume of 20 μl. Preincubation with coatomer and subsequent incubation with GAP were carried out as described above, and reactions were terminated by the addition of 0.5 ml of cold charcoal suspension (5% charcoal in 50 mm NaH2PO4). Following centrifugation, the amount of 32Pi in the supernatant was determined by scintillation counting. In both assays described above, the addition of coatomer without GAP had little effect (less than 5% of GTP hydrolyzed). Coatomer background values were subtracted from GAP activity in the presence of coatomer in all experiments except for those shown in Fig. 4. Experiments were repeated at least 3 times, and a representative experiment is presented. Goldberg (27Goldberg J. Cell. 1999; 96: 893-902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar) recently reported that coatomer stimulates GTP hydrolysis by up to 1000-fold on a lipid-independent ARF1 mutant (Δ17-ARF1) in the presence of a fragment of GAP1 containing amino acids 6–136. We investigated whether coatomer stimulation is restricted to GAP1 or can take place with additional members of the ARF GAP family. We employed the full-length GAP1 protein that was generated using a baculovirus expression system,S. cerevisiae Gcs1, and a catalytically active fragment of mammalian ASAP1. As shown in Fig. 1, coatomer stimulated GTP hydrolysis mediated by both GAP1 and Gcs1 on Δ17-ARF1. Under the conditions employed (0.2 μm coatomer, 0.5 μm Δ17-ARF1), the stimulation of GTP hydrolysis by coatomer (about 10-fold) was considerably lower than that reported by Goldberg (27Goldberg J. Cell. 1999; 96: 893-902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). This difference was attributed to a large extent to the higher rate of GTP hydrolysis in the presence of GAPs alone in our experiments. The higher rate may have been caused by the fact that GAP1 and Gcs1 were employed as full-length proteins in contrast to the truncated GAP1 used by Goldberg, which may have only partial activity in the absence of coatomer (18Cukierman E. Huber I. Rotman M. Cassel D. Science. 1995; 270: 1999-2002Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). We also tested the effect of coatomer with ASAP1, an ARF GAP that is distinct from GAP1 in structural features and cellular localization (plasma membrane for ASAP1 versus Golgi for GAP1 (18Cukierman E. Huber I. Rotman M. Cassel D. Science. 1995; 270: 1999-2002Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 38Randazzo P.A. Andrade J. Miura K. Brown M.T. Long Y.Q. Stauffer S. Roller P. Cooper J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4011-4016Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar)). Additionally, ASAP1 has a pleckstrin homology domain, and its activity is stimulated by phosphoinositides that appear to act through an allosteric mechanism (39Kam J.L. Miura K. Jackson T.R. Gruschus J. Roller P. Stauffer S. Clark J. Aneja R. Randazzo P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9653-9663Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.2 A, using Δ17-ARF1 as substrate, ASAP1 GAP activity was strongly stimulated by phosphoinositides. This is in agreement with recent findings by Kamet al. (39Kam J.L. Miura K. Jackson T.R. Gruschus J. Roller P. Stauffer S. Clark J. Aneja R. Randazzo P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9653-9663Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) who employed Δ13-ARF1 as substrate. By contrast, coatomer had little effect on ASAP1 activity either in the absence or presence of phosphoinositides. A reciprocal pattern was observed with GAP1-(1–257) where coatomer but not phosphoinositides stimulated GTP hydrolysis on Δ17-ARF1. Similar results were obtained with full-length GAP1/Gcs1 or in the presence of phosphatidylinositol 4′,5′-bisphosphate instead of the phosphoinositide mixture (data not shown). The experiments described above were carried out with Δ17-ARF1, an ARF1 mutant that does not depend on lipids for GTP binding (40Paris S. Beraud-Dufour S. Robineau S. Bigay J. Antonny B. Chabre M. Chardin P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22221-22226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) and has therefore been employed to study the interaction of ARF1 with proteins and drugs in solution (27Goldberg J. Cell. 1999; 96: 893-902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 32Goldberg J. Cell. 1998; 95: 237-248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar,40Paris S. Beraud-Dufour S. Robineau S. Bigay J. Antonny B. Chabre M. Chardin P. J. Biol.

Mol Cell. 1999; 3: 275-285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). However, the amino terminus of wild-type ARF1 with its attached myristate residue serves to anchor GTP-bound ARF1 to phospholipid bilayers, and it is this form of ARF1 that is likely to encounter GAP in the biological membrane. It was therefore of interest to test the effect of coatomer on GAP1-dependent hydrolysis of GTP on myristoylated ARF1. In the experiments presented in Figs.3 and 4, myristoylated ARF1 was loaded with GTP in the presence of unilamellar liposomes containing a phospholipid mixture that is typical of biological membranes (40% phosphatidylcholine, 30% phosphatidylethanolamine, and 30% phosphatidylserine). In the absence of coatomer, GAP1 stimulated GTP hydrolysis on myristoylated ARF1 at concentrations that were lower by 2 orders of magnitude than those required to stimulate hydrolysis on Δ17-ARF1 (compare Figs. 1 and 3). When GAP activity was assayed on myristoylated ARF1 over a broad range of GAP1 concentrations, there was no significant difference between the activities in the presence or absence of coatomer (Fig. 3). Moreover, coatomer had no effect on GTP hydrolysis on myristoylated ARF1 even at coatomer concentrations that were supra-optimal in the Δ17-ARF1 assay (Fig. 4). The difference in coatomer sensitivity between Δ17-ARF1 and myristoylated ARF1 may be attributed to differences in conformation between the native and truncated proteins or to the presence of phospholipids in assays employing myristoylated ARF1. These phospholipids, which are required for GTP binding to myristoylated ARF1, may obscure the coatomer effect by promoting an efficient interaction between ARF1 and GAP. To distinguish between the above possibilities, we tested the effect of coatomer on myristoylated ARF1 in the presence of mixed detergent/phospholipid micelles. In the experiment presented in Fig. 5, ARF1 was loaded with GTP in the presence of DMPC and cholate, which were added at approximately equimolar concentrations. Under these conditions, coatomer caused a small but reproducible stimulation of GAP1-dependent GTP hydrolysis on myristoylated ARF1 (Fig.5). When the ratio of detergent to phospholipid was increased with the addition of a 4-fold excess of detergent to the assay (0.4% CHAPS), there was a dramatic decrease in GAP1 activity whereas the addition of coatomer caused an approximately 2-fold stimulation. Thus, under conditions where membrane structure is perturbed, GTP hydrolysis on myristoylated ARF1 can become responsive to coatomer. The mechanism by which GAPs stimulate GTP hydrolysis on Ras and Rho GTPases was shown to involve an arginine residue in GAP that inserts into the GTP-binding pocket of the GTPase and assists in catalysis (42Scheffzek K. Ahmadian M.R. Wittinghofer A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 257-262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). Recently, structural and functional studies have suggested that in the case of ARF, coatomer rather than GAP might contribute the catalytic arginine (27Goldberg J. Cell. 1999; 96: 893-902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar) although another study (30Mandiyan V. Andreev J. Schlessinger J. Hubbard S.R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6890-6898Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) has brought this conclusion into question. All ARF GAPs described so far contain one invariant arginine residue in a position equivalent to Arg-50 in GAP1 (30Mandiyan V. Andreev J. Schlessinger J. Hubbard S.R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6890-6898Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 38Randazzo P.A. Andrade J. Miura K. Brown M.T. Long Y.Q. Stauffer S. Roller P. Cooper J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4011-4016Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Replacement of Arg-50 of GAP1 with alanine, as well as conservative replacements with lysine or glutamine, completely abolished GAP activity on myristoylated ARF1 even at very high mutant concentrations (Fig. 6 A). Similar findings were recently reported for PAPβ and ASAP1 ARF GAPs (30Mandiyan V. Andreev J. Schlessinger J. Hubbard S.R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6890-6898Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 38Randazzo P.A. Andrade J. Miura K. Brown M.T. Long Y.Q. Stauffer S. Roller P. Cooper J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4011-4016Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). When activity was assayed using Δ17-ARF1, the Arg-50 mutants were completely inactive in the absence or presence of coatomer (data not shown). These findings highlight the importance of the conserved Arg residue of ARF GAPs. The Arg-50 mutants were highly soluble, had normal zinc content, and migrated in a Resource Q column similar to the wild-type protein, suggesting that the mutations do not adversely affect their conformation. It was thus of interest to test whether the mutants can compete with wild-type GAP1 for coatomer-dependent hydrolysis of GTP on ARF1. As shown in Fig. 6 B, the R50K mutant had no effect on this reaction at mutant concentrations of up to 10-fold higher than the wild-type GAP concentration. The mutant also failed to inhibit GAP1 activity on myristoylated ARF1 (data not shown). A possible interpretation of these findings is discussed below. The findings presented in this paper provide further insight into the role of coatomer in GTP hydrolysis on ARF1. We show that the effect of coatomer depends on both the form of ARF1 employed in the assay and on the phospholipid environment. In confirmation of the findings by Goldberg (27Goldberg J. Cell. 1999; 96: 893-902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar), we observed strong stimulation of GTP hydrolysis on the lipid-independent truncated ARF1 lacking the first 17 amino acids in the presence of both full-length mammalian GAP1 and yeast Gcs1. By contrast, GAP-dependent GTP hydrolysis on myristoylated ARF1 preloaded with GTP in the presence of phospholipid vesicles was coatomer-insensitive. The efficacy of ARF GAPs on myristoylated ARF1 was much higher than on Δ17-ARF1 even when coatomer was used to stimulate GAP activity on Δ17-ARF1 (compare Figs. 1 and 3). It is also noteworthy that the stimulation of GAP activity on Δ17-ARF1 by coatomer in our experiments (∼10-fold) was much lower than that reported by Goldberg (up to 1000-fold) under similar conditions. This is probably because of differences in the GAP preparations. The full-length GAP1 and Gcs1 proteins we employed showed low but significant coatomer-independent activity whereas Goldberg employed a catalytic fragment of GAP1 (amino acids 6–136), which showed negligible activity under comparable conditions. We have previously observed that truncated GAP1 mutants containing fewer than the first 146 amino acids displayed reduced activity on myristoylated ARF1 (18Cukierman E. Huber I. Rotman M. Cassel D. Science. 1995; 270: 1999-2002Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). It therefore appears that very short forms of GAP1 are incapable of effectively activating either Δ17-ARF1 or myristoylated ARF1 whereas, for reasons that are not understood, coatomer appears to confer high activity on the short GAP1 mutants. The fact that GAPs can be highly active with phospholipid-bound ARF1 in the absence of coatomer argues against the previously proposed catalytic role of coatomer in GTP hydrolysis (27Goldberg J.

Additionally, if coatomer acted through a catalytic mechanism such as the contribution of a catalytic residue to the ARF1 GTP-binding pocket (27Goldberg J. Cell. 1999; 96: 893-902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar), then one would predict that coatomer would stimulate the activity of all ARF GAPs. However, we found that ASAP1, which shows high similarity to GAP1 in its catalytic domain, displayed coatomer-insensitive activity (see Fig. 2 A). Lastly, all ARF GAPs contain an invariant arginine residue, and this residue is essential for GAP1 activity either in the presence or absence of coatomer (Fig. 5) as well as for the activity of two additional ARF GAPs (30Mandiyan V. Andreev J. Schlessinger J. Hubbard S.R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6890-6898Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 38Randazzo P.A. Andrade J. Miura K. Brown M.T. Long Y.Q. Stauffer S. Roller P. Cooper J.A. Proc.

Andreev J. Schlessinger J. Hubbard S.R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6890-6898Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and 38Randazzo P.A. Andrade J. Miura K. Brown M.T. Long Y.Q. Stauffer S. Roller P. Cooper J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4011-4016Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar and this study) argues that this residue in GAP plays a catalytic rather than structural role. If coatomer does not act catalytically, then how does it stimulate GAP activity on ARF? The rate of GTP hydrolysis is determined by the kinetic parameters of the interaction between ARF and GAP, as well as by the turnover number of the GTPase reaction. Our previous studies (34Antonny B. Huber I. Paris S. Chabre M. Cassel D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30848-30851Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) have shown that in the presence of phospholipid vesicles of varying compositions, GAP1 as well as Gcs1-dependent hydrolysis of GTP on myristoylated ARF1 correlates with the extent of binding of GAP to the vesicles. These observations suggest that phospholipid vesicles facilitate GAP activity because of a proximity effect brought about by the binding of both GAP and its substrate ARF1-GTP to the same vesicle. Coatomer may act in a similar manner by interacting not only with ARF1 but also with GAP, thus generating a tripartite complex with three pairs of protein-protein interactions. Such interaction could be restricted to only a few GAPs, because GAPs such as ASAP1 that do not depend on coatomer for activity (Fig.2 A) may lack a coatomer-binding domain. The finding that coatomer does not facilitate GTP hydrolysis when ARF1 is bound to phospholipid vesicles suggests that GAP interacts with lipids more avidly than with coatomer. Upon disruption of the phospholipid vesicles by detergent (Fig. 5), GAP activity decreases and becomes coatomer-responsive. Apparently because of the small size of the mixed detergent/phospholipid micelles, simultaneous binding of ARF and GAP to the same micelle becomes unlikely. Thus, under these conditions, the system behaves in a manner that is qualitatively similar to the lipid-free Δ17-ARF1 assay system. It is noteworthy that we did not observe an inhibition of coatomer-dependent GAP activity by the GAP1 mutant R50K (Fig. 6 B) and two other inactive mutants (D65A and W32A). 2E. Szafer and D. Cassel, unpublished observations. This absence of competition suggests that any interaction of GAP with coatomer must be of low affinity. Such low affinity interaction could nonetheless suffice for generating the stimulation of GAP activity by the proximity effect. In addition to its modulation by coatomer and membrane lipids in vitro, GAP1 interacts in vivo with the Golgi receptor for endoplasmic reticulum proteins bearing the KDEL tag (43Aoe T. Cukierman E. Lee A. Cassel D. Peters P.J. Hsu V.W. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7305-7316Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 44Aoe T. Lee A.J. van Donselaar E. Peters P.J. Hsu V.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1624-1629Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Whereas coatomer and phospholipids affect the activity of carboxyl-terminal truncated GAP1 (34Antonny B. Huber I. Paris S. Chabre M. Cassel D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30848-30851Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), the KDEL receptor interacts with GAP1 through the carboxyl-terminal segment (45Aoe T. Huber I.

The understanding of how each of these factors contributes to GAP1 targeting and/or catalytic activity in vivo will be a subject of future studies.

https://openalex.org/W2333115886,"Differentiation of the human embryonal carcinoma cell line NTERA-2 is characterized by changes in morphology, altered patterns of gene expression, reduced proliferative potential, and a loss of tumorigenicity. The cellular repressor of E1A-stimulated genes, CREG, was previously shown to antagonize transcriptional activation and cellular transformation by the Adenovirus E1A oncoprotein. These properties suggested that CREG may function to inhibit cell growth and/or promote differentiation. Here we show that CREG is a secreted glycoprotein which enhances differentiation of NTERA-2 cells. Northern blot analysis reveals that, although CREG mRNA is widely expressed in adult tissues, CREG mRNA is not significantly expressed in pluripotent mouse embryonic stem cells or NTERA-2 embryonal carcinoma cells. CREG mRNA is rapidly induced upon in vitro differentiation of both mouse embryonic stem cells and human NTERA-2 cells. We show that constitutive expression of CREG in NTERA-2 cells enhances neuronal differentiation upon treatment with retinoic acid. Media enriched in CREG was also found to promote NTERA-2 differentiation in the absence of an inducer such as retinoic acid. These studies suggest that secreted CREG protein participates in a signaling cascade important for differentiation of pluripotent stem cells such as those found in teratocarcinomas."

The SMN protein is expressed in all tissues of metazoan organisms, but particularly high levels are expressed in motor neurons. In contrast, individuals affected by the most severe form of SMA, Werdnig-Hoffman syndrome or SMA type I, have barely detectable levels of SMN in motor neurons (6Coovert D.D. Le T.T. McAndrew P.E.

This process takes place in the cytoplasm, where the snRNAs combine with Sm proteins, and the assembled snRNPs are subsequently imported to the nucleus where pre-mRNA splicing occurs (17Mattaj I.W.

SMN also plays a role in the nucleus, where it is required for maintaining an active pre-mRNA splicing machinery likely by regenerating functional snRNPs after splicing (14Pellizzoni L. Kataoka N.

Mice with homozygousSMN disruption display massive cell death during early embryonic development (20Schrank B. Gotz R. Gunnersen J.M. Ure J.M. Toyka K.V. Smith A.G. Sendtner M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Reduction of SMN protein levels in the spinal cord of SMN heterozygous mice leads to motor neuron degeneration resembling SMA type III (22Jablonka S. Schrank B. Kralewski M. Rossoll W. Sendtner M. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 341-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Using a mouse model it was also shown that SMA is caused by insufficient SMN production by the SMN2 gene (24Monani U.R. Sendtner M. Coovert D.D. Parsons D.W. Andreassi C. Le T.T. Jablonka S. Schrank B. Rossol W. Prior T.W. Morris G.E. Burghes A.H.M. Hum. Mol.

A candidate orthologue of SMN was identified by sequence analysis of the Schizosacharomyces pombe genome (hypothetical protein Yab8) (25Talbot K. Ponting C.P. Theodosiou A.M. Rodrigues N.R. Surtees R. Mountford R. Davies K.E. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1997; 6: 497-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The genetic approaches to which S. pombe is amenable makes it an attractive system for the study of SMN function. Here we characterize the S. pombe orthologue of SMN (ySMN). We show that smn + is essential for viability of S. pombe. We demonstrate that ySMN can interact with SMN and Sm proteins indicating the remarkable conservation of SMN functional domains in S. pombe. To construct a diploid strain for use in the disruption of smn +, the two haploid strains FY261 (ATCC; h − ura4-D18 leu1–32 ade6-M210 can1–1) and KGY554 (ATCC;h + ura4-D18 leu1–32 ade6-M216 his3-D1) were crossed to produce the diploid C2. S. pombe strains were grown at 30 °C in YES or EMM medium lacking the appropriate auxotrophic supplements for marker selection (26Moreno S. Klar A. Nurse P. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 795-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (3148) Google Scholar). For preparing plates, the media were solidified by adding 2% agar. Medium containing 5-fluoro-orotic acid (5-FOA) was prepared as described previously (27Sikorski R.S. Boeke J.D. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 302-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). Escherichia colicells were grown in LB broth or LB agar (28Sambrook J. Fritsch E. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) and supplemented with ampicillin or kanamycin at 100 μg/ml. To generate a null allele of smn +, most of the coding region was replaced by the hisG-ura4+-hisG cassette, which can be used repeatedly for constructing gene disruptions and/or for sequentially introducing aura4 + marker plasmid (29McNabb D.S. Pak S.M. Guarente L. BioTechniques. 1997; 22: 1134-1139Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The starting plasmid was pDM291 (a gift from Leonard Guarente, Massachusetts Institute of Technology). The 5′-flanking region was obtained by genomic PCR using the following oligonucleotides: 5′-CCGTGAAGATCTCGTCGTAATTACGTGGAGCTACC-3′ and 5′-TACGAAGATCTCATCTAGCCTAGAATCCGGGT-3′. The obtained fragment was inserted into pDM291, which was then used to clone the 3′-flanking region. The 3′-flanking region was obtained by genomic PCR using the following oligonucleotides: 5′-ATACGGATCCCTTAGCGACGAAAAGCCTGA-3′ and 5′-ATACGGATCCAGGTAATCGGTATACGTCGC-3′. To replace one chromosomal copy of smn +, the final plasmid was digested with BglI and transformed into the C2 diploid strain using the lithium acetate protocol (30Keeney J.B. Boeke J.D. Genetics. 1994; 136: 849-856Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Transformed cells were spread on EMM medium -Ura (26Moreno S. Klar A. Nurse P. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 795-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (3148) Google Scholar) and incubated for 5 days. Individual colonies were streaked on the same media again, and 20 single colony isolates were checked by genome PCR to determine the correct integration of the inserted cassette, as described previously (31Ling M. Merante F. Robinson B.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4924-4925Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). A diploid strain with one chromosomal copy of smn + replaced with the knockout cassette was then transformed with pSP1/ySMN, which had smn +as hemagglutinin epitope amino-terminal fusion under the controlnmt1 promoter of different strengths (pSP1/ySMN173, pSP1/ySMN273, or pSP1/ySMN373). Random spore analysis was performed again to get the haploid strain Δsmn (h −− ura4-D18 leu1–32 ade6-M210 can1–1 smn::ura4 + (pSP1/ySMN,smn + , LEU2)). The Δsmn1 (h−− ura4-D18 leu1–32 ade6-M210 can1–1 smn(pSLF/ySMN, smn + , ura4 +)) strain was produced by transforming Δsmn with pSLF/ySMN plasmids (pSLF173/ySMN, pSLF273/ySMN, or pSLF373/ySMN) expressing ySMN at different levels. The ura4 + selectable marker was excised from the disruption allele by selecting the Δsmn strain on 5-FOA medium. Transformants were streaked on nonselective YES medium, and individual colonies were plated on EMM-Ura and -Leu plates. The clones, which could grow on -Ura medium but could not grow on -Leu media, were referred to as Δsmn1. To check the ability of hSMN to substitute for smn + we used the following method. The tester strain Δsmn was maintained with smn + on pSP1/ySMN plasmids (pSP1/ySMN173, pSP1/ySMN273, or pSP1/ySMN373) carrying LEU2 selectable marker. The ura4 + selectable marker was excised by plating cells on medium containing 5-FOA so that we could later transform them with pSLF/ySMN plasmids (pSLF173/ySMN, pSLF273/ySMN, or pSLF373/ySMN) carrying ura4 +. Transformants were streaked on nonselective YES medium, and 500 individual colonies were plated on EMM-Ura plates selective for smn +or -Leu plates selective for hSMN. The plasmid shuffle technique was used to test the ability of deletion mutants of smn + to substitute for wild typesmn + as described previously (32Boeke J.D. Trueheart J. Natsoulis G. Fink G.R. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 164-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (1083) Google Scholar). The tester strain Δsmn1 carried smn + on pSLF/ySMN plasmids (pSLF173/ySMN, pSLF273/ySMN, or pSLF373/ySMN). The wild type ySMN and the deletion mutants, ySMNΔN47 and ySMNΔYG, expressed from the different nmt1 promoters, were transformed into the tester strain on a second plasmid bearing the LEU2selectable marker (pSP1/ΔN47/173, pSP1/ΔN47/273, pSP1/ΔN47/373, pSP1/ΔYG173, pSP1/ΔYG273, pSP1/ΔYG373, pSP1/ySMN173, pSP1/ySMN273, and pSP1/ySMN373). The LEU+ transformants were plated to medium containing 5-FOA. Only cells that lost the pSLF/ySMN plasmid expressing wild type smn + can grow on 5-FOA plates. Standard recombinant DNA techniques were performed as described previously (28Sambrook J. Fritsch E. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). DNA fragments corresponding to open reading frames of ySMN, deletion mutants of ySMN, and human SMN (hSMN) were generated by PCR amplification using specific primers. The obtained PCR fragments carryingsmn + or deletion mutants of smn + were cloned into pSLF173, pSLF273, and pSLF373 vectors (33Forsburg S.L. Sherman D.A. Gene (Amst.). 1997; 191: 191-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). The obtained plasmid (pSLF173/ySMN, pSLF273/ySMN, pSLF373/ySMN, pSLF173/ΔN47, pSLF273/ΔN47, pSLF373/ΔN47, pSLF173/ΔYG, pSLF273/ΔYG, and pSLF373/ΔYG) carryHA-smn + or HA-smn under three different versions of nmt1 promoter (173, full-strength; 273, medium strength; 373, low strength). The plasmids were used to produce PCR fragments carrying smn + orsmn under the control of the same promoters. The obtained fragment was cloned into the pSP1 vector (34Cottarel G. Beach D. Deuschle U. Curr. Genet. 1993; 23: 547-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) to produce pSP1/ySMN173, pSP1/ySMN273, pSP1/ySMN373, pSP1/ΔN47/173, pSP1/ΔN47/273, pSP1/ΔN47/373, pSP1/ΔYG173, pSP1/ΔYG273, and pSP1/ΔYG373. Plasmids carrying Myc-tagged hSMN and hSMNΔN27 were previously described (14Pellizzoni L. Kataoka N. Charroux B. Dreyfuss G. Cell. 1998; 95: 615-624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). Myc-tagged hSMNΔYG lacking the last 26-carboxyl-terminal amino acids was generated by PCR amplification using specific primers. All the 6His-tagged constructs were generated by cloning the PCR inserts into the pET28 vector (Novagene). Green fluorescent protein·ySMN fusion protein was produced by cloning the entire open reading frame of ySMN into the pSGP573 vector (a gift from Susan Forsburg, The Salk Institute). The green fluorescent protein·ySMN protein was expressed under the control of the strong nmt1 promoter. All plasmids were checked by DNA sequencing. The [35S]methionine-labeled proteins were produced by in vitro coupled transcription-translation reactions (Promega Biotech) in the presence of [35S]methionine (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). 6His-tagged fusion proteins were produced from a pET28 bacterial expression system in the E. colistrain BL21(DE3) and purified using nickel chelation chromatography (Novagene) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The glutathioneS-transferase (GST)·ySMN, GST·hSMN, and GST·hSmB fusion proteins were expressed from a GST expression vector, pGEX-5X-3 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), in the E. coli strain BL21 and purified on glutathione-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according the manufacturer's protocol. Purified GST or GST fusion proteins (2 μg) bound to 25 μl of glutathione-Sepharose beads were incubated with in vitro translated protein in 1 ml of binding buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 200 mmNaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 2 μg/ml leupeptin and pepstatin A, and 0.5% aprotinin). After incubation for 1 h at 4 °C, the resin was washed five times with 1 ml of binding buffer. The bound fraction was eluted by boiling in SDS-PAGE sample buffer and resolved by SDS-PAGE. The gels were fixed for 30 min, and the signal was enhanced by treatment with Amplify solution (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For direct in vitro binding, purified GST or GST·ySMN proteins (2 μg) bound to 25 μl of glutathione-Sepharose beads were incubated with 5 μg of purified 6His-tagged ySMN or 6His-tagged human SmB in 1 ml of binding buffer (50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 2 μg/ml leupeptin and pepstatin A, and 0.5% aprotinin). After incubation for 1 h at 4 °C, the resin was washed five times with 1 ml of binding buffer. The bound fraction was eluted by boiling in SDS-PAGE sample buffer, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotted using a rabbit polyclonal anti-His-tag antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Anti-ySMN antibody 1G6 was produced by immunizing Balb/C mice with ySMN protein fused to GST. Hybridoma production, screening, and ascites fluid production were performed as described previously (35Choi Y.D. Dreyfuss G. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 99: 1997-2004Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) using 6His-tagged ySMN protein. Purified recombinant His-tagged ySMN or ySMNDYG (40 mg) proteins were applied to a TSK-GEL G3000-SW glass column (Tosohaas, Montgomeryville, PA) equilibrated in a buffer containing 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 100 mmKCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol. Fractions were collected at a 0.25 ml/min flow rate, pooled as indicated, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting with an anti-T7 tag monoclonal antibody (Novagen). Immunofluorescence onS. pombe was performed as described by Hagan and Hyams (36Hagan I.M. Hyams J.S. J. Cell Sci. 1988; 89: 343-357Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Laser confocal fluorescence microscopy was performed with aLeica TCS 4D (Germany) confocal microscope, and images from each channel were recorded separately. We began the analysis of ySMN by determining whether smn +is essential for S. pombe. We constructed a cassette for disruption of a chromosomal copy of the smn +gene. In this cassette, most of the coding sequence of smn + was replaced with hisG-ura4 + -hisG. After transformation of the cassette and ura4 + selection, random spore analysis was performed to assess the haploid phenotype. None of the examined individual haploid clones was able to grow on EMM-Ura medium selective for the knockout allele (data not shown). This demonstrates that the knockout of the SMN gene is lethal. To obtain a knockout of the SMN gene in a haploid strain, it was necessary to express ySMN from a plasmid. To do so, we transformed diploid cells heterozygous for smn::ura4 + with a LEU2plasmid carrying a wild type copy of the smn +gene. To obtain haploid clones with a knocked out allele of smn and a plasmid carrying normalsmn +, we performed random spore analysis. To confirm that the smn + gene is essential we checked the stability of the plasmid carryingsmn +. All 500 of the tested clones retained the plasmid expressing smn + demonstrating that the smn + gene is essential for S. pombe. The importance of ySMN for survival of S. pombe demonstrates that ySMN plays a fundamental role in cell physiology and suggests that the functions performed by SMN are evolutionarily conserved fromS. pombe to mammals. We tested whether hSMN could functionally substitute for the yeast protein in vivo. Because the smn + gene is essential for viability, our tester Δsmn strain was maintained with smn + under the control of nmt1promoters of different strengths (strong, medium, or weak) on aLEU2 plasmid. The tester strain was transformed with ura4 + plasmids, which express hSMN at different levels using the same promoters. Transformants were streaked on nonselective YES medium, and 500 individual clones were plated on EMM-Ura plates selective for smn + or -Leu plates selective for hSMN. None of the different combinations of plasmids expressing smn + and hSMN lost the plasmids carrying the smn + gene demonstrating that hSMN can not replace smn + in vivo (data not shown). The inability of hSMN to functionally substitute for ySMN is perhaps not surprising, because the overall primary sequence similarity between these proteins is only 24% and is restricted almost entirely to the amino-terminal and carboxyl-terminal regions of the protein (Fig. 1). To further study the ySMN protein we produced an anti-ySMN monoclonal antibody (1G6). Western blot analysis shows that the 1G6 monoclonal antibody does not cross-react with Xenopus laevis and human SMNs but specifically recognizes the purified ySMN recombinant protein and a single band of similar size in total yeast extract (Fig.2 A). Endogenous ySMN migrates at a size corresponding to about 32 kDa instead of the predicted size of 18 kDa. We note that hSMN also migrates at higher molecular weight than is predicted from its molecular mass (9Liu Q. Dreyfuss G. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3555-3565Crossref PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar). To further confirm that antibody 1G6 reacts specifically with the ySMN protein, we performed immunoprecipitation of ySMN produced by transcription and translationin vitro. IG6 antibody, but not the nonspecific SP2/0 antibody, efficiently immunoprecipitates ySMN (Fig. 2 B). The 1G6 antibody was further used to localize ySMN by confocal immunofluorescence microscopy. ySMN is found in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm (Fig. 3, A and B). A similar distribution was also observed upon expression of a green fluorescent protein·ySMN fusion protein (Fig. 3,C and D). This indicates that the subcellular localization of SMN is evolutionary conserved. In the nucleus of mammalian cells, SMN is highly concentrated in gems (9Liu Q. Dreyfuss G. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3555-3565Crossref PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar). However, we were unable to discern whether ySMN is concentrated in similar subnuclear structures because of the much smaller size of S. pombe nuclei.Figure 3Intracellular localization of ySMN.A, laser confocal image of indirect immunofluorescence onS. pombe cells using the anti-ySMN monoclonal antibody 1G6.B, DAPI-4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole staining of the field shown in A.

If, in S. pombe, ySMN performs similar functions to its human orthologue, it would be expected to display similar interactions. To test this possibility, we performed in vitro protein binding assays with ySMN as well as with hSMN, hGemin2, and the human Sm proteins B, D1, D2, D3, E, F, and G (37Lehmeier T. Raker V. Hermann H. Luhrmann R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12317-12321Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 38Hermann H. Fabrizio P. Raker V.A. Foulaki K. Hornig H. Brahms H. Luhrmann R.

We used human Sm proteins for these experiments because they are similar to their yeast counterparts (45–85% similarity), readily available, and because we were interested in determining the degree of conservation of the interactions between SMN and Sm proteins. ySMN was first produced as a fusion protein with GST. Purified GST or GST·ySMN immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose were incubated with in vitro translated [35S]methionine-labeled ySMN, hSMN, hGemin2, and Sm proteins. Full-length ySMN, hSMN, and human Sm B, D2, and D3 bound specifically to immobilized GST·ySMN but not to GST alone (Fig.4 and data not shown). ySMN interacts considerably better with itself than with both human SMN and human SmB (see “Discussion”). To exclude the possibility that these interactions are mediated by some components present in the rabbit reticulocyte lysate, wild-type full-length ySMN, and human SmB were produced as recombinant 6His-tagged proteins and incubated with GST or GST·ySMN. As shown in Fig. 5, ySMN and human SmB bind specifically and directly to ySMN but not to GST alone. These findings demonstrate the evolutionary conservation of SMN interactions; ySMN can oligomerize and bind Sm proteins as well as hSMN. As an additional control we used GST·Gemin2 fusion and detected no interaction (data not shown).Figure 5ySMN interacts directly with itself and human SmB (hSmB) in vitro. Purified 6His-tagged ySMN or hSmB recombinant proteins were incubated with purified GST·ySMN or GST alone. The input lane shows 10% of 6His-tagged proteins. Bound proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting with anti-His-tag antibody.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The evolutionary conservation of SMN interactions despite the low overall sequence similarity between the hSMN and ySMN proteins prompted us to analyze the role of the conserved domains of ySMN in oligomerization and binding to the human Sm proteins. Two short regions of SMN appear to be particularly highly conserved through evolution (Fig. 1). In hSMN the conserved amino terminus is involved in binding Gemin2 and nucleic acids, whereas the conserved Y/G box near the carboxyl terminus (25Talbot K. Ponting C.P. Theodosiou A.M. Rodrigues N.R. Surtees R. Mountford R. Davies K.E. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1997; 6: 497-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) plays a crucial role in oligomerization and Sm and Gemin3 binding (8Liu Q. Fischer U. Wang F. Dreyfuss G. Cell. 1997; 90: 1013-1021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar, 10Lorson C.L. Strasswimmer J. Yao J.M. Baleja J.D. Hahnen E. Wirth B. Le T.

Cell. 1997; 90: 1023-1029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar). We therefore generated two deletion mutants of ySMN, ySMNΔN47 and ySMNΔYG, which lack the amino-terminal or carboxyl-terminal conserved domains, respectively (Fig. 1). Immobilized GST, GST·ySMN, or GST·hSmB fusion proteins were incubated with in vitro translated [35S]methionine-labeled full-length ySMN, ySMNΔN47, or ySMNΔYG. Fig. 6 A shows that full-length ySMN and ySMNΔN47, but not ySMNΔYG, bound specifically to GST·ySMN and GST·hSmB. No binding to GST alone was observed. Similarly, the deletion of the conserved Y/G box of hSMN completely abolished binding to GST·hSMN and GST·SmB (Fig. 6 B). We conclude that the Y/G box in ySMN and hSMN is necessary for both SMN oligomerization and for its binding to Sm proteins. To examine directly the state of oligomerization of ySMN and the ySMNΔYG deletion mutant, we performed gel filtration experiments using purified recombinant ySMN or ySMNΔYG. Fig. 6 C shows that ySMN forms large oligomers of up to a molecular mass corresponding to ∼440 kDa. We note that no monomeric ySMN is detectable. In contrast, the deletion mutant ySMNΔYG is unable to oligomerize. Therefore, ySMN like its human counterpart efficiently oligomerizes, and the Y/G box is required for oligomerization. In light of the findings described above we asked whether the SMNΔN47 and SMNΔYG deletion mutants could functionally substitute for full-length ySMN protein in vivo. To do so, we used the plasmid shuffle technique (32Boeke J.D. Trueheart J. Natsoulis G. Fink G.R. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 164-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (1083) Google Scholar). Because the smn +gene is essential for viability, our tester Δsmn1 strain carried the smn + gene on a ura4 plasmid. The wild type ySMN and the deletion mutants, SMNΔN47 and SMNΔYG, expressed from the nmt1 promoters of different strengths, were transformed into the tester strain on a second plasmid bearing the LEU2 selectable marker. The LEU+ transformants were plated on medium containing 5-FOA. Only cells that have lost the ura4 + plasmid expressingsmn + can grow on 5-FOA plates. Thus, the transformants will not grow unless the deletion mutants of ySMN can functionally substitute for ySMN. As shown in Fig.7, the test strain transformed with aLEU2 plasmid expressing ySMN lacking either the carboxyl- or amino-terminal domains failed to grow on 5-FOA-containing medium. This demonstrates that these conserved domains of SMN are essential for ySMN function and cell viability. Interestingly, we found that smn cells containing a plasmid carrying smn + under the control of a strong nmt1 promoter formed small colonies and grew significantly slower than cells containing smn +expressed under the control of medium or weak promoters (Fig.8). This effect did not depend on strain background, because overexpression of ySMN in wild type strain FY261 also slowed down growth (data not shown). This indicates that overexpression of ySMN is disadvantageous to cells. Cells expressing SMNΔYG under a strong promoter did not have the same phenotype (Fig.8). We also found that cells overexpressing the ySMNΔN47 allele under control of the strong nmt1 promoter did not grow (Fig. 8). This effect did not depend on the background level of smn + expression. We conclude that overexpression of ySMNΔN47 is particularly toxic to these cells and suggests that it has a dominant negative phenotype on cell growth. We have recently determined that hSMN deleted of the first 27 amino acids (hSMNΔN27) has a dominant negative phenotype (14Pellizzoni L. Kataoka N. Charroux B. Dreyfuss G. Cell. 1998; 95: 615-624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). Fig. 6 B shows that hSMNΔN27 has similar binding avidity for hSMN and SmB as wild type hSMN. Thus, both hSMNΔN27 and ySMNΔN47 maintain the ability to interact with SMN and Sm proteins and display a dominant negative phenotype. A putative S. pombe orthologue of mammalian SMN, Yab8, was previously identified by sequence similarity (25Talbot K. Ponting C.P. Theodosiou A.M. Rodrigues N.R. Surtees R. Mountford R. Davies K.E. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1997; 6: 497-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). However, the extent of primary sequence similarity between Yab8 open reading frame and hSMN is only 24% and is restricted to the amino-terminal and carboxyl-terminal regions of these proteins. This raised a question as to whether the Yab8 is a genuine orthologue of hSMN. The findings reported here support the conclusion that Yab8 is indeed an orthologue of hSMN, and we therefore refer to it here as ySMN. The knockout of the smn + gene is lethal. The importance of ySMN for survival of S. pombe demonstrates that ySMN plays a fundamental role in cell function. We showed that ySMN is found in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm. These results show that the subcellular localization of SMN is evolutionary conserved, because a generally similar localization of SMN in both cytoplasm and nucleus is also seen in mammalian cells and C. elegans (9Liu Q. Dreyfuss G. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3555-3565Crossref PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar,21Miguel-Aliaga I. Culetto E. Walker D.S. Baylis H.A. Sattelle D.B. Davies K.E. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1999; 8: 2133-2143Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Oligomerization of hSMN and its interaction with the Sm proteins are likely required for its function in snRNP assembly and splicing machinery regeneration (8Liu Q. Fischer U. Wang F. Dreyfuss G. Cell. 1997; 90: 1013-1021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar, 11Pellizzoni L. Charroux B. Dreyfuss G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11167-11172Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). If, in S. pombe, the ySMN protein performs similar functions to its human orthologue, it would be expected to display similar interactions i.e.oligomerization and binding to Sm proteins. Indeed, we found that ySMN displayed similar interactions to the vertebrate SMN protein in that it can oligomerize and bind Sm proteins. These findings strongly suggest that Yab8p is the S. pombe orthologue of hSMN. ySMN and hSMN interact with each other and ySMN interacts with human Sm proteins. Considering the evolutionary divergence between ySMN and hSMN proteins (24% similarity) and between S. pombe Sm proteins and human Sm proteins (45–85% similarity), these results indicate a remarkable conservation of SMN interactions. This prompted us to examine further the role of the conserved domains of ySMN in oligomerization and binding to Sm proteins. Our binding experiments demonstrate that the Y/G box of ySMN and hSMN is necessary for both SMN self-association and for interaction with Sm proteins. Studies with SMN deletion constructs indicate that both the amino-terminal and carboxyl-terminal domains of ySMN are essential for cell viability. The fact that SMNΔN47 has similar avidity for ySMN and human Sm proteins as the wild type protein suggests that other interactions, in addition to SMN oligomerization and Sm binding, are likely essential for the housekeeping function of SMN. The most likely candidate for such interactions would be the S. pombeorthologue of human Gemin2, which interacts with the conserved amino-terminal region of hSMN (8Liu Q. Fischer U. Wang F. Dreyfuss G. Cell. 1997; 90: 1013-1021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar, 14Pellizzoni L. Kataoka N. Charroux B. Dreyfuss G. Cell. 1998; 95: 615-624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). The central region of human SMN (amino acids 96–160) shows amino acid sequence similarity to a tudor domain (40Ponting C.P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 51-52Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). The specific function of this domain is still an open issue. It has been proposed that the tudor domain might represent a RNA- and/or protein binding domain, and it has recently been suggested that the tudor domain of SMN in higher eukaryotes is necessary and sufficient for binding of Sm proteins (16Buhler D. Raker V. Luhrmann R. Fischer U. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1999; 8: 2351-2357Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). The results we report here are in contrast to this conclusion. The ySMN protein does not contain a tudor domain (41Talbot K. Miguel-Aliaga I. Mohaghegh P. Ponting C.P. Davies K.E. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1998; 7: 2149-2156Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), but nevertheless ySMN interacts with Sm proteins. We cannot entirely exclude the possibility that the region corresponding to the tudor domain in human SMN contributes to Sm binding; however, we demonstrate that the evolutionarily conserved carboxyl-terminal Y/G region of both hSMN and ySMN is necessary for SMN-Sm binding. Some of the discrepancy in the results may be accounted for by a difference in experimental conditions. Previous experiments in this laboratory have also shown that a partial deletion or a point mutation in the Y/G box of hSMN indeed severely compromise Sm protein binding, and SMN oligomerization is required for high affinity interaction with Sm proteins (11Pellizzoni L. Charroux B. Dreyfuss G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11167-11172Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Thus, we conclude that the tudor domain is not sufficient for Sm binding as previously suggested (16Buhler D. Raker V. Luhrmann R. Fischer U. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1999; 8: 2351-2357Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Overexpression of ySMN is deleterious to growth in S. pombe. Interestingly, cells overexpressing ySMNΔYG did not show this phenotype. This could be explained by the fact that the Y/G deletion mutant does not interact with SMN and Sm proteins and thus represents a loss of function protein, which therefore does not interfere with the function of the wild type protein. In contrast, overexpression of the ySMNΔN47 mutant allele is toxic in these cells. We conclude that overexpression of ySMNΔN47 has a dominant negative phenotype on cell growth. This is reminiscent of a recently described dominant negative mutant of hSMN, SMNΔN27 (14Pellizzoni L. Kataoka N. Charroux B. Dreyfuss G. Cell. 1998; 95: 615-624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). Expression of SMNΔN27 causes a dramatic reorganization of snRNPs in the nucleus and inhibits pre-mRNA splicing (14Pellizzoni L. Kataoka N. Charroux B. Dreyfuss G. Cell. 1998; 95: 615-624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). hSMNΔN27 has similar binding avidity for hSMN and SmB as wild type hSMN. Thus, both hSMNΔN27 and ySMNΔN47 maintain the ability to oligomerize SMN and to interact with Sm proteins. Although the molecular basis of this dominant negative effect of ySMNΔ47 overexpression is not yet known, the identification of such a dominant negative mutant in a distant organism such as S. pombe strengthens the conclusion that the amino-terminal region of SMN has a critical, though hitherto unknown, function. Finally, the availability of the S. pombe system and reagents we describe here should open the way for further advances on the structure and function of the SMN protein and help unveil the molecular pathogenesis of SMA.

Consequently, toxins need to be soluble to reach their target cells. However, once the target is reached, the toxins are transformed into membrane proteins (highly insoluble by definition). Accumulating data reveal that the domain that interacts with the membrane uses one of two structural strategies (5Cabiaux V. Wolff C. Ruysschaert J.M. Int. J. Biol.

In the first and best known group of toxins, the membrane-interacting domain contains hydrophobic and amphipathic α-helices (1Cramer W.A. Cohen F.S. Merrill A.R. Song H.Y. Mol.

In the soluble stage, the hydrophobic helices are sheltered from the solvent by a barrel of amphipathic helices. The second group of toxins is intrinsically soluble, and its structure is mainly composed of a β-barrel fold (9Li J. Koni P.A. Ellar D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 257: 129-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). These toxins depend on oligomerization to produce sufficient hydrophobicity for membrane insertion to occur. Bacillus thuringiensis, a ubiquitous Gram-positive bacterium, produces parasporal crystals (10Schesser J.H. Kramer K.J. Bulla Jr., L.A. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1977; 33: 878-880Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Within these crystals lie the δ-endotoxins, which are specific insect toxins. The δ-endotoxins are digested by the insects in the midgut and are enzymatically modified into their active form (6Rajamohan F. Lee M.K. Dean D.H. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1998; 60: 1-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), after which the toxins bind to target cells through a two-stage process to form channels/pores (11Slatin S.L. Abrams C.K. English L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 169: 765-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 12Vachon V. Paradis M.J. Marsolais M. Schwartz J.L. Laprade R. J. Membr. Biol. 1995; 148: 57-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The first step involves reversible binding to a receptor followed by an irreversible step in which membrane insertion occurs (3Lesieur C. Vecsey-Semjen B. Abrami L. Fivaz M. Gisou van der Goot F. Mol. Membr. Biol. 1997; 14: 45-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 6Rajamohan F. Lee M.K. Dean D.H. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol.

Lee M.K. Wu S.J. Chen X.J. Alcantara E. Hussain S.R. Gene. 1996; 179: 111-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The irreversible step is also implicated with toxicity; however, the mode of action of the toxin is not yet clearly understood. Biophysical and structural studies of the δ-endotoxins as a paradigm for membrane toxins may help elucidate the specific interactions, mechanism of insertion, and organization within the membrane of toxins and channel proteins. A major part of the current knowledge concerning the mechanism of δ-endotoxin toxicity is through experience with three major proteins of the Cry family: Cry3A, Cry1Aa, and Cry1Ac. The Cry proteins are an extensive toxin family found within the δ-endotoxin crystals. Their pore-forming domain comprises both amphipathic and hydrophobic α-helices. The Cry3A and Cry1Aa structures were resolved in aqueous solution; Cry1Ac protein is highly homologous to Cry1Aa (7Li J.D. Carroll J. Ellar D.J. Nature. 1991; 353: 815-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar, 8Grochulski P. Masson L. Borisova S. Pusztai-Carey M. Schwartz J.L. Brousseau R. Cygler M. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 254: 447-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). Furthermore, many mutations were done on the full-length proteins, including specific mutations in the α4 and α5 regions. Currently, the umbrella model best explains the Cry mechanism of toxicity. Briefly, the protein goes through a metamorphosis upon membrane binding in which structural rearrangement occurs (7Li J.D. Carroll J. Ellar D.J. Nature. 1991; 353: 815-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar, 15Gazit E. La Rocca P. Sansom M.S. Shai Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1999; 274: 31996-32000Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Presumably, this is followed by a hydrophobic hairpin insertion into the phospholipid bilayer, whereas the amphipathic helices are spread on the surface. Later, oligomerization occurs, and a channel or pore is formed. Two highly hydrophobic helices of the Cry3A domain I, namely α4 and α5, were each shown to form homo- and hetero-oligomers in the membrane milieu (17Gazit E. Shai Y. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 3429-3436Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 18Gazit E. Bach D. Kerr I.D. Sansom M.S. Chejanovsky N. Shai Y. Biochem. J. 1994; 304: 895-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 19Gazit E. Shai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2571-2578Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Helix α5 of Cry3A (17Gazit E. Shai Y. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 3429-3436Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) and Cry1Ac (20Cummings C.E. Armstrong G. Hodgman T.C. Ellar D.J. Mol. Membr. Biol. 1994; 11: 87-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) were shown also to have membrane permeation capabilities. These data suggest that α4 and α5 might be the region that is inserted into the membrane and actually participates in pore formation. This model is supported by mutagenesis analysis done on full-length proteins, where loss of toxicity is a common characteristic of most α4 and α5 mutations (16Masson L. Tabashnik B.E. Liu Y.B. Brousseau R. Schwartz J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31996-32000Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 21Aronson A.I. Wu D. Zhang C. J.

Int. 1998; 44: 825-832PubMed Google Scholar, 23Manoj Kumar A.S. Aronson A.I. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 6103-6107Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Previous studies indicate that although mutations in α4 usually cause loss of toxicity, they do not change the aggregation capabilities of the toxin (23Manoj Kumar A.S. Aronson A.I. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 6103-6107Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, a strong correlation was found between toxicity and α5 oligomerization. Specifically, for mutations that did not affect toxicity, the protein retained its oligomerization ability, excluding one known exception H168R (23Manoj Kumar A.S. Aronson A.I. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 6103-6107Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recent results based on site-directed mutagenesis place α4 in the aqueous interface of the pore, whereas the more hydrophobic α5 is located at the back of the oligomer and interacts mainly with α4 and the lipid bilayer (16Masson L. Tabashnik B.E. Liu Y.B. Brousseau R. Schwartz J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31996-32000Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it was shown that mutations I132S and Q133R, located on the polar surface of α4, substantially decrease the pore-forming activity, whereas F134L results in a 3-fold increase in activity (23Manoj Kumar A.S. Aronson A.I. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 6103-6107Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, there is still no direct evidence that α4 inserts together with α5 as a hairpin into the membrane to form a pore. To directly support this hypothesis, we have synthesized and characterized the corresponding peptides derived from Cry1Ac, namely, α5, α4, and its active and non-active mutants and the full-length membrane-inserted domain α4-loop-α5 (TableI). Note that the benefits of studying the membrane-inserted segment of a protein were clearly demonstrated by revealing the crystal structure of the KcsA potassium channel, which was done using only the membrane-inserted segments, helix M1-pore region-helix M2, of the channel (24MacKinnon R. Cohen S.L. Kuo A. Lee A. Chait B.T. Science. 1998; 280: 106-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). Importantly, the structure and the organization of this region were in agreement with studies carried out with the isolated helix M1, the pore region H5, and the helix M2 (25Ben-Efraim I. Shai Y. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 2287-2297Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 26Ben-Efraim I. Shai Y. Biophys.

Open table in a new tab Mutations are bold and underlined. Membrane permeation studies, binding experiments, and competition assays between the α4-loop-α5 and the α4 and α5 peptides provide direct evidence of the role of α4-loop-α5 as the membrane-inserted pore-forming hairpin in which α4 and α5 lines the lumen of the channel, and α5 participates also in the oligomerization of the toxin. Furthermore, the striking finding that an α4 mutant can inhibit α4-loop-α5 pore formation provides, to our knowledge, the first example that a mutated helix of a pore-forming toxin can function as an immunity protein by directly interacting with the segments that form the pore, similar to what has been proposed for the immunity proteins of colicin E1 (27Zhang Y.L. Cramer W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10176-10184Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This presents a potential means of interfering with the assembly and function of other membrane proteins as well. These results are discussed also with regard to the importance of understanding protein-protein interaction within the membrane milieu (28Choma C. Gratkowski H. Lear J.D. DeGrado W.F. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 161-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar, 29Xiao Zhou F. Cocco M.J. Russ W.P. Brunger A.T. Engelman D.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 154-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). Butyloxycarbonyl amino acids were obtained from Bachem (Bubendorf, Switzerland), and t- butyloxycarbonyl-Leu-OCH2 peptidylglycine α-amidating monooxygenase resin was purchased from Applied Biosystems (Foster City, CA). Other reagents used for peptide synthesis included trifluoroacetic acid (Sigma), N,N-diisopropylethylamine (Aldrich; distilled over ninhydrin), benzotriazol-N-oxytris(dimethylamino)phosphonium hexafluorophosphate (Sigma), N-methylmorpholine (Aldrich), and dimethylformamide (peptide synthesis grade, Biolab). Egg phosphatidylcholine (PC)1 and phosphatidylserine (PS) from bovine spinal cord (sodium salt, grade I) was purchased from Lipid Products (South Nutfield, UK). 3–3′-Dipropylthiadicarbocyanine iodide (5Cabiaux V. Wolff C. Ruysschaert J.M. Int. J. Biol. Macromol. 1997; 21: 285-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar),N-[7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazole-4-yl] chloride (NBD-Cl), and 5- (and 6-)-carboxytetramethylrhodamine (Rho) and calcein were purchased from Molecular Probes (Junction City, OR). All other reagents were of analytical grade. Buffers were prepared in double distilled water. The peptides were synthesized by a standard solid phase method on peptidylglycine α-amidating monooxygenase resin as described (30Merrifield R.B. Vizioli L.D. Boman H.G. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 5020-5031Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). NBD and Rho labeling of the N terminus of the resin-bound peptides was achieved as described previously (31Rapaport D. Shai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23769-23775Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The peptides were cleaved from the resin by HF treatment and purified by reverse transcription-HPLC. Purity (∼99%) was confirmed by analytical HPLC. The peptides were subjected to amino acid analysis and to Platform LCZ micromass electrospray to confirm their composition. Small unilamellar vesicles (SUV) were prepared from PC/PS (1:1 w/w) or from PC by sonication as described previously in detail (32Shai Y. Bach D. Yanovsky A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20202-20209Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Membrane permeation was assessed utilizing the calcein release assay (33Allen T.M. Cleland L.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1980; 597: 418-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar) as described previously (34Pouny Y. Rapaport D. Mor A. Nicolas P. Shai Y. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 12416-12423Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar). Briefly, SUV (7 mg/ml) were prepared in a 60 mm calcein and a 10 mm HEPES solution, pH 7.4. Liposomes were then passed through a Sephadex G-50 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in order to separate the free calcein. A final concentration of 2.5 μm SUV was used. Trapped inside vesicles, the calcein dye is self-quenched. Thus, membrane permeation can be detected by an increase in fluorescence as peptides are added. The percentage of fluorescence recovery, Ft, was defined as Ft = (ft −Io)/(I max −Io) × 100, where I 0 = initial fluorescence, Imax = the total fluorescence observed after the addition of paradaxin, and ft = the fluorescence observed after adding the peptide, at time t. Paradaxin was used at a concentration of 0.6 μm, which caused 100% calcein leakage from the vesicles. Rhodamine fluorescence is highly sensitive to self-quenching but poorly affected by the dielectric constant of its environment. Therefore, the tendency of the peptides to oligomerize in aqueous solution was tested using Rho-labeled peptides. Changes in the fluorescence were measured after adding proteinase K (10 mg/ml final concentration) to Rho-labeled peptides (0.1 μm) previously dissolved in PBS. More proteinase K was added until there was no further change in the fluorescence emission. Excitation was set at 530 nm, and emission was set at 580 nm. All the fluorescence measurements in the present study were done on an Aminco Bowman Series 2 SLM spectrofluorometer (SLM-Aminco Spectronic Instruments). The degree of peptide association with PC or PC/PS SUV was measured by adding increasing amounts of vesicles to 0.1 μm NBD-labeled peptides dissolved in PBS. The fluorescence intensity was measured as a function of the lipid/peptide molar ratio, with excitation set at 467 nm, and emission set at 530 nm. The fluorescence values were corrected by subtracting the corresponding blank (PBS with the same amount of vesicles). The binding isotherms were analyzed as partition equilibria (31Rapaport D. Shai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23769-23775Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 35Schwarz G. Gerke H. Rizzo V. Stankowski S. Biophys.

Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 2751-2759Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 38Beschiaschvili G. Seelig J. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 52-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar) using the formulaXb* = Kp* Cf, where Xb* is defined as the molar ratio of bound peptide per 60% of the total lipid, assuming that the peptides were initially partitioned only over the outer leaflet of the SUV, as has been previously suggested (38Beschiaschvili G. Seelig J. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 52-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar); Kp* corresponds to the partition coefficient; and Cf represents the equilibrium concentration of the free peptide in the solution. The value Xb was calculated by extrapolatingF ∞ (the fluorescence signal obtained when all the peptide is bound to lipid) from a double-reciprocal plot of F (total peptide fluorescence) versus CL (total concentration of lipids) (35Schwarz G. Gerke H. Rizzo V. Stankowski S. Biophys. J. 1987; 52: 685-692Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Knowing the fluorescence intensities of unbound peptide, F0, as well as the bound peptide, F, the fraction of membrane-bound peptide, fb, could be calculated using the formulafb = (F − F0)/(F∞ − F0). Having calculated the value of fb, it is then possible to calculate Cf as well as the extent of peptide binding, Xb*. The curves that result from plotting Xb* versus free peptide,Cf, are referred to as the conventional binding isotherms. FRET experiments were performed by using NBD-labeled peptides serving as energy donors and Rho-labeled peptides serving as energy acceptors (39Gazit E. Shai Y. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 12363-12371Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Fluorescence spectra were obtained at room temperature, with excitation set at 467 nm (8-mm slit). In a typical experiment, a donor peptide (final concentration, 0.05 μm) was added to a dispersion of SUV (350 μm) in PBS followed by the addition of an acceptor peptide in several sequential doses. Fluorescence spectra were obtained before and after adding the acceptor. The efficiency of energy transfer (E) was determined by measuring the decrease in the quantum yield of the donor as a result of the presence of the acceptor. The value E was determined experimentally from the ratio of the fluorescence intensities of the donor in the presence (Ida) and in the absence (Id) of the acceptor at the wavelengths of the maximal donor emission. The percentage of transfer efficiency (E) is given by %E = (1 − Ida/Id) × 100. Subtracting the signal produced by the acceptor-labeled analogue alone made correction for the contribution of acceptor emission as a result of direct excitation. The contribution of buffer and vesicles was subtracted from all measurements. Previous studies have indicated that the α4 and α5 helices of domain I are important for toxicity and pore formation (15Gazit E. La Rocca P. Sansom M.S. Shai Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12289-12294Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 17Gazit E. Shai Y. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 3429-3436Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 20Cummings C.E. Armstrong G.

FEBS Lett. 1997; 410: 397-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). We have investigated whether helices α4, α5, and α4-loop-α5 can cause membrane leakage of encapsulated calcein from vesicles. Fig.1 shows the dose response of peptide-induced calcein release from PS/PC vesicles. Clearly the results show that α4 and its mutants are incapable of causing any appreciable calcein release on PS/PC vesicles. Compared with α4 peptides, α5 had low activity (Fig. 1). These results are in accord with published data on a homologue Cry3A α5 peptide (18Gazit E. Bach D. Kerr I.D. Sansom M.S. Chejanovsky N. Shai Y. Biochem. J. 1994; 304: 895-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) and single channel experiments with an elongated version of Cry1Ac α5. Among the mutated α4 peptides, F9L showed activity, albeit low, on PC vesicles, which is more relevant to the midgut membranes. This result is in agreement with a mutation done on the full-length protein, where the F9L mutation was found to exhibit hyperactivity compared with the WT protein (23Manoj Kumar A.S. Aronson A.I. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 6103-6107Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, we found α4-loop-α5 to be much more active than α4 and α5 alone or together. For example, the α4-loop-α5 reached 70% activity on PS/PC vesicles at a peptide/lipid molar ratio of 0.04, whereas α4 and α5 were practically inactive at the same ratio (Fig. 1). A mixture of α4 or its mutants with α5 did not exhibit any synergism, implying that a linkage of the two helices with the loop is necessary for activity (Fig. 1). All other peptides showed similar activities on PC vesicles, and therefore, only α5 is shown as an example. These results support the umbrella model, where α4-loop-α5 hairpin is inserted into the membrane in an anti-parallel manner to form the active pore/channel (7Li J.D. Carroll J. Ellar D.J. Nature. 1991; 353: 815-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar,41Schwartz J.L. Juteau M. Grochulski P. Cygler M. Prefontaine G. Brousseau R. Masson L.

A. 1998; 95: 12289-12294Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). To test whether the inability of α4 peptides to cause calcein release is a result of their inability to bind phospholipid membranes, we performed additional binding experiments. Characterization of vesicle binding by WT, I7S, Q8R, and F9L α4 was facilitated through the attachment of an NBD moiety to the peptides. NBD is very sensitive to the dielectric constant of the environment. Therefore, membrane binding can be detected as a substantial increase in NBD fluorescence. The attachment of the NBD did not alter the membrane-permeating activity of the peptides, which has also been shown in other studies (19Gazit E. Shai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2571-2578Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). A constant concentration of peptide (0.1 μm) was titrated with the desired vesicles (e.g. PC, PS/PC). Increases in the fluorescence intensities of NBD-labeled peptides as a function of the lipid/peptide molar ratio yielded the conventional binding curves (see Fig. 2, panels A,B, C, and D for α4, Q8R, I7S, and F9L, respectively, for PC/PS vesicles). Similar curves were obtained with PC vesicles and, therefore, are not shown. The light scattering of the vesicles was subtracted by repeating the experiments with unlabeled peptides. Since all peptides apart from α5 are monomeric in aqueous solution, as revealed by rhodamine dequenching experiments (see next paragraph), we were able to analyze their binding isotherms as partition equilibria. The surface partition coefficients were estimated from the initial slopes of the curves shown in the insets of all panels in Fig. 2 (for PC/PS) (38Beschiaschvili G. Seelig J. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 52-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). TableII shows the calculated partition coefficients (and the free energy of binding, −ΔG) for both PC and PC/PS phospholipid membranes. F9L shows positive cooperativity as the binding isotherm curves upward. The wild type and the rest of the α4 mutants give linear binding isotherm curves. WT-α5 binding to vesicles was also facilitated through NBD-labeled peptides (Fig.3). The binding isotherm was not extrapolated for α5, since it is an oligomer in solution (see next paragraph and Fig. 4). However, the saturation level of the α5 binding isotherm is similar to that of the α4 peptides, and therefore it is reasonable to assume a partition coefficient of the same scale (10−4m−1). Qualitatively, since the fluorescence of NBD-labeled α5 did not dequench upon binding, we qualitatively plotted the binding isotherm, which displayed strong positive cooperativity (Fig. 3, inset), similar to that previously shown for Cry3A α5 (15Gazit E.

https://openalex.org/W2025229617,"X-ray crystallographic studies of the N-terminal domain of Hsp90 have identified an unconventional ATP binding fold, thereby inferring a role for ATP in the regulation of the Hsp90 activity. In this report, N-ethylcarboxamidoadenosine (NECA) was used to investigate the nucleotide binding properties of GRP94, the endoplasmic reticulum paralog of Hsp90. Whereas Hsp90 did not bind NECA, GRP94 bound NECA in a saturable manner with aKd of 200 nm. NECA binding to GRP94 was efficiently blocked by geldanamycin and radicicol. Analysis of ligand binding stoichiometries by radioligand and calorimetric techniques indicated that GRP94 bound 1 mol of NECA/mol of GRP94 dimer. In contrast, GRP94 bound radicicol at a stoichiometry of 2 mol of radicicol/mol of GRP94 dimer. In [3H]NECA displacement assays, GRP94 displayed binding interactions with ATP, dATP, ADP, AMP, cAMP, and adenosine, but not GTP, CTP, or UTP. To accommodate the 0.5 mol of NECA:mol of GRP94 binding stoichiometry observed for the native GRP94 dimer, a model for allosteric regulation (negative cooperativity) of ligand binding is proposed. A hypothesis on the regulation of GRP94 conformation and activity by adenosine-based ligand(s) other than ATP and ADP is presented. X-ray crystallographic studies of the N-terminal domain of Hsp90 have identified an unconventional ATP binding fold, thereby inferring a role for ATP in the regulation of the Hsp90 activity.

In [3H]NECA displacement assays, GRP94 displayed binding interactions with ATP, dATP, ADP, AMP, cAMP, and adenosine, but not GTP, CTP, or UTP. To accommodate the 0.5 mol of NECA:mol of GRP94 binding stoichiometry observed for the native GRP94 dimer, a model for allosteric regulation (negative cooperativity) of ligand binding is proposed. A hypothesis on the regulation of GRP94 conformation and activity by adenosine-based ligand(s) other than ATP and ADP is presented. glucose-regulated protein of 94 kDa N-ethylcarboxamidoadenosine heat shock protein of 90 kDa polyethyleneimine polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis immunoglobulin heavy chain-binding protein 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid GRP941 (gp96, ERp99, endoplasmin), the endoplasmic reticulum paralog of cytosolic Hsp90, serves a molecular chaperone function in the endoplasmic reticulum and is known to interact with nascent immunoglobins, major histocompatibility complex class II molecules, HSV-1 glycoproteins, thyroglobulin, collagen, and p185ErbB2 (1Melnick J.

To date, the mechanisms responsible for regulating the interactions of GRP94 with both polypeptide and peptide substrates remain to be determined.Given the high sequence identity between GRP94 and Hsp90 it is reasonable to assume that the two paralogs are regulated by a similar, if not identical, mechanism. Hsp90 function in protein folding is known to require the activity of a series of co-chaperones and accessory molecules, including Hsp70, p48Hip, p60Hop, p23, and FKBP52 (23Prodromou C. Siligardi G.

These co-chaperones and accessory molecules participate in both concerted and sequential interactions with Hsp90 and thereby serve to regulate its chaperone activity (31Buchner J. Trends Biochem.

In addition to the contribution of co-chaperone proteins to the regulation of Hsp90 function, recent crystallographic studies have identified an unconventional ATP/ADP binding pocket in the N-terminal domain of yeast and human Hsp90, suggesting that Hsp90 activity is regulated through cyclic ATP binding and hydrolysis, as has been established for the Hsp70 family of chaperones (35Kassenbrock C.K.

Beginning with earlier, sequence-based analyses, it was reported that Hsp90 contained motifs bearing significant similarities to the Walker “A” and “B” sequences associated with ATP binding (41Csermely P.

Although these sequences are substantially different from the consensus sequences found among serine and tyrosine kinases, they are homologous to the ATP binding sequence seen in the Hsp70 family of proteins (41Csermely P.

Consistent with sequence predictions, ATP binding, autophosphorylation activity, and ATPase activity have all been demonstrated for Hsp90, although these findings are not without controversy (39Prodromou C.

Pavletich N.P. Hartl F.U. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 901-910Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). Aided by atomic scale structural insights, amino acid residues critical for ATP binding and hydrolysis were subsequently identified (39Prodromou C. Roe S.M. O'Brien R. Ladbury J.E. Piper P.W.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4829-4836Crossref PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar). Thus, in the human Hsp90, aspartate 93 (Asp-128 for GRP94; Asp-79 for yeast) provides a direct hydrogen bond interaction with the N-6 of the purine moiety of the adenosine ring and is essential for ATP binding (39Prodromou C.

Pavletich N.P. Hartl F.U. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 901-910Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). Glutamate 47 (Glu-82 for GRP94; Glu-33 in yeast) was postulated to play an important catalytic role in ATP hydrolysis, based both on its location relative to bound nucleotide and through comparison with the ATP-binding domain of Escherichia coliDNA gyrase B (39Prodromou C.

Pavletich N.P. Hartl F.U. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 901-910Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). In subsequent mutagenesis studies of yeast Hsp90, it was observed that a Asp-79 mutant was deficient in ATP binding and that Glu-47 mutants were deficient in ATP hydrolysis activity (40Obermann W.M. Sondermann H. Russo A.A. Pavletich N.P. Hartl F.U. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 901-910Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar, 46Panaretou B. Prodromou C. Roe S.M. O'Brien R. Ladbury J.E. Piper P.W. Pearl L.H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4829-4836Crossref PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar). As further evidence for an essential function of these residues in Hsp90 activity, yeast containing either mutant form of the Hsp90 gene were inviable (40Obermann W.M. Sondermann H. Russo A.A. Pavletich N.P. Hartl F.U. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 901-910Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar, 46Panaretou B. Prodromou C. Roe S.M. O'Brien R. Ladbury J.E. Piper P.W. Pearl L.H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4829-4836Crossref PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar).As previously noted, Hsp90 and GRP94 share high sequence identity and presumably identical adenosine nucleotide-dependent modes of regulation. Past investigations suggest, however, that Hsp90 and GRP94 may differ in their nucleotide binding properties. For example, studies on the identification and characterization of adenosine A2 receptors, performed with the adenosine A2agonist 5′-(N-ethylcarboxamido)adenosine (NECA), identified GRP94, but not Hsp90, as an abundant NECA-binding protein (50Hutchison K.A. Fox I.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19898-19903Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 51Hutchison K.A. Nevins B. Perini F. Fox I.H. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 5138-5144Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In these studies, it was reported that GRP94 displayed submicromolar affinity for NECA and did not bind N-6- or C-8- substituted adenosine derivatives (52Fox I.H. Kurpis L. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 6952-6955Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 53Huttemann E. Ukena D. Lenschow V. Schwabe U. Naunyn Schmiedebergs Arch. Pharmacol. 1984; 325: 226-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). These observations are intriguing in that they directly corroborate crystallographic data identifying critical binding interactions for the N6-adenine in the adenosine nucleotide binding of Hsp90 as well as the hindered conformation of the C-8 adenine in the Hsp90-bound state (39Prodromou C. Roe S.M. O'Brien R. Ladbury J.E. Piper P.W. Pearl L.H. Cell. 1997; 90: 65-75Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1105) Google Scholar, 40Obermann W.M. Sondermann H. Russo A.A.

Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 901-910Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar).Although ATP binding and hydrolysis are generally accepted as biological properties of Hsp90, it is not known whether ATP/ADP serve an identical function(s) in the regulation of GRP94 activity. To date, neither ATP nor ADP have been demonstrated to regulate the (poly)peptide binding activity of GRP94, nor has a functional correlate to the low level ATPase and autophosphorylation activities of GRP94 been identified (11Wearsch P.A. Voglino L. Nicchitta C.V. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5709-5719Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 54Csermely P. Miyata Y. Schnaider T. Yahara I. J. Biol.

To investigate adenosine nucleotide interactions with GRP94, we utilized NECA in analyses of the kinetics, stoichiometry, specificity, and enzymatic consequences of nucleotide binding to GRP94. We report that GRP94 and Hsp90 can be readily distinguished by virtue of their capacity to bind NECA, although both proteins bind the N-terminal nucleotide binding pocket antagonists geldanamycin and radicicol and both geldanamycin and radicicol compete NECA binding to GRP94. GRP94 bound NECA at a stoichiometry of 0.5 mol of NECA:mol of GRP94. Given the apparent half-site stoichiometry of NECA binding to GRP94, a model of allosteric regulation (negative cooperativity) for NECA/GRP94 interactions is proposed.DISCUSSIONIn this article, we report that the Hsp90 paralogs GRP94 and Hsp90 display distinct structural and functional interactions with adenosine nucleotides. Unlike Hsp90, GRP94 displays specific, high affinity binding interactions with the substituted adenosine derivative NECA. In analyzing such interactions, we propose that NECA binding to GRP94 is under allosteric regulation and, with a maximal 50% ligand occupancy, displays negative cooperativity. Analysis of the nucleotide binding properties of GRP94 indicate that ligand selection is based primarily on the adenosine moiety, and thus significant binding interactions between GRP94 and ATP, dATP, ADP, AMP, cAMP, or free adenosine were observed.NECA, an adenosine receptor agonist, was first identified as a ligand for GRP94 in studies of the distribution and pharmacological profile of NECA-binding sites (50Hutchison K.A. Fox I.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19898-19903Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 51Hutchison K.A. Nevins B. Perini F. Fox I.H. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 5138-5144Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). It is important to note that in these studies, NECA binding activity was observed in cytosol fractions derived from tissue homogenates, yet the vast majority of the cytosolic NECA binding activity could be attributed to GRP94, rather than Hsp90 (51Hutchison K.A. Nevins B. Perini F. Fox I.H. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 5138-5144Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Given the structural similarities between the adenosine nucleotide-binding domains of the two proteins, this is surprising. In detail, N6-substituted adenosine analogs do not bind to GRP94 (51Hutchison K.A. Nevins B. Perini F. Fox I.H. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 5138-5144Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) (data not shown), as would be predicted given that the N-6 of the adenine purine is the sole direct hydrogen bond between the nucleotide and the nucleotide binding pocket (39Prodromou C. Roe S.M. O'Brien R. Ladbury J.E. Piper P.W. Pearl L.H. Cell. 1997; 90: 65-75Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1105) Google Scholar, 40Obermann W.M. Sondermann H. Russo A.A. Pavletich N.P. Hartl F.U. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 901-910Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). Furthermore, those amino acid side chains that participate in water-mediated hydrogen bonds with the N-7 of the purine ring (N-51 in human Hsp90 = N-86 in GRP94), the N-1 of the purine ring (G-97 in human Hsp90 = G130 of GRP94), and the N-6 of the purine ring (L-48 in human Hsp90 = L-83 in GRP94) are conserved between Hsp90 and GRP94. Thus, although the relevant structural components of the adenosine nucleotide binding pocket are conserved between the two proteins, the ligand specificities of the two binding sites differ. It would appear, then, that the specificity of ligand binding to the N-terminal adenosine nucleotide binding pocket is influenced by the domains C and perhaps N-terminal to the binding pocket, where significant sequence divergence between Hsp90 and GRP94 can be identified. That domains C-terminal to the adenosine nucleotide binding pocket may contribute to the regulation of ligand binding was also concluded from a recent study of radicicol binding to truncated forms of GRP94 (62Schulte T.W. Akinaga S. Murakata T. Agatsuma T. Sugimoto S. Nakano H. Lee Y.S. Simen B.B. Argon Y. Felts S. Toft D.O. Neckers L.M. Sharma S.V. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 1435-1448Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) as well as from studies demonstrating that ATPase activity for Hsp90 could not be detected in the recombinant N-terminal nucleotide-binding domain, but was apparent in assays with the full-length native protein (40Obermann W.M. Sondermann H. Russo A.A. Pavletich N.P. Hartl F.U. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 901-910Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar).The data obtained from both traditional ligand binding studies (Fig. 2and Ref. 51Hutchison K.A. Nevins B. Perini F. Fox I.H. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 5138-5144Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) and isothermal titration calorimetry demonstrate that GRP94 binds NECA at a stoichiometry of 1 mol of NECA:mol of GRP94 dimer. In addition, competition studies indicate that NECA binding to GRP94 can be wholly competed by geldanamycin, radicicol, ATP, or ADP (Fig. 3), indicating that NECA is binding to the conserved, N-terminal adenosine nucleotide-binding domain. Because GRP94 contains two such sites per molecule (58Wearsch P.A. Nicchitta C.V. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 16760-16769Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), it appears then that NECA binding to GRP94 displays negative cooperativity. As an allosteric mechanism, the existence of negative cooperativity indicates that the two subunits of GRP94 are in communication with one another, either via direct physical interaction or via communication through the C-terminal assembly domain. What might the physiological relevance of such regulation be? It is possible that ligand binding to one domain alters the conformation of the partner domain and thereby enhances or diminishes its interactions with substrate (poly)peptides and/or accessory molecules. Coincidentally, the potent inhibition of Hsp90 function by geldanamycin and radicicol may thus reflect their ability to bind both subunits of the dimeric protein. These data also indicate that studies of ligand interactions in the intact protein may differ substantially from those observed in isolated domains and suggest the need for complementary analyses of such potentially different conformational states of the ligand binding pocket. At present, we cannot formally eliminate the possibility that NECA binds to a single unique site on GRP94, a site not present on HSP90, and thus that the observed binding parameters are representative of single site interactions. Arguing against this interpretation are the following observations: 1) NECA binding is efficiently competed with ATP, ADP, geldanamycin, and radicicol, all of which are known to bind to the N-terminal nucleotide binding fold. 2) The structural requirements for ligand binding to the nucleotide binding fold, as displayed in ligand structure, are recapitulated in NECA binding studies. Thus, for example, N6-substituted adenosine derivatives do not compete NECA binding to GRP94; 3) the structural elements of this unusual nucleotide binding fold, which are necessary for the unconventional bound ligand conformation, are not present in domains of GRP94 other than the N-terminal domain (68Dutta R. Inouye M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 24-28Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar).The identification of ATP and ADP as ligands for the Hsp90s is based on crystallographic studies identifying an N-terminal, highly conserved nucleotide binding pocket (39Prodromou C.

Cell. 1997; 90: 65-75Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1105) Google Scholar), complementary in vivostudies demonstrating that the amino acids that participate in ATP/ADP binding are essential for Hsp90 function in vivo (40Obermann W.M.

Pearl L.H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4829-4836Crossref PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar), and lastly that the Hsp90s display ATPase activity (40Obermann W.M. Sondermann H. Russo A.A. Pavletich N.P. Hartl F.U. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 901-910Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar, 47Grenert J.P. Johnson B.D. Toft D.O. J. Biol.

Chem. 1993; 268: 1479-1487Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). That Hsp90 and GRP94 differ in NECA binding activity, despite the high homologies in the N-terminal nucleotide binding pockets of the two proteins, suggests that differences might also exist in the ability of the two proteins to catalyze ATP hydrolysis. In fact, when the GRP94 ATPase activity was investigated at ATP concentrations appropriate for such a low affinity interaction it was observed that the GRP94 ATPase activity barely exceeded the rate of spontaneous hydrolysis and did not saturate at increasing ATP concentrations. The low level of ATPase activity was not significantly inhibited by NECA, thereby suggesting that the observed activity is not generated from the N-terminal domain of GRP94. From these data, we conclude that the observed GRP94-dependent ATP hydrolysis, as displayed in the absence of any, as yet unidentified co-factors does not occur as a consequence of ATP binding to the nucleotide binding pocket.Further confounding the assignment of ATP and ADP as the physiological ligands for GRP94 are the following observations. First, neither ATP nor ADP has been demonstrated to regulate GRP94 activity (10Wearsch P.A. Nicchitta C.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5152-5156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Second, that by virtue of its insensitivity to NECA and radicicol, the GRP94 autophosphorylation and ATPase activity does not reflect adenosine nucleotide binding to the N-terminal nucleotide-binding domain (Fig.6 A). Third, and perhaps most importantly, ATP, ADP, and the inhibitor geldanamycin elicit similar conformational changes in GRP94. Interestingly, in the presence of NECA a different conformational change from that occurring in the presence of ATP, ADP, or geldanamycin was observed (Fig. 7). Although a precise stru"
https://openalex.org/W2029317617,"Previous studies have demonstrated that P388D1 macrophages are able to mobilize arachidonic acid (AA) and synthesize prostaglandins in two temporally distinct phases. The first phase is triggered by platelet-activating factor within minutes, but needs the cells to be previously exposed to bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) for periods up to 1 h. It is thus a primed immediate phase. The second, delayed phase occurs in response to LPS alone over long incubation periods spanning several hours. Strikingly, the effector enzymes involved in both of these phases are the same, namely the cytosolic group IV phospholipase A2 (cPLA2), the secretory group V phospholipase A2, and cyclooxygenase-2, although the regulatory mechanisms differ. Here we report that P388D1 macrophages mobilize AA and produce prostaglandins in response to zymosan particles in a manner that is clearly different from the two described above. Zymosan triggers an immediate AA mobilization response from the macrophages that neither involves the group v phospholipase A2 nor requires the cells to be primed by LPS. The group VI Ca2+-independent phospholipase A2 is also not involved. Zymosan appears to signal exclusively through activation of the cPLA2, which is coupled to the cyclooxygenase-2. These results define a secretory PLA2-independent pathway for AA mobilization in the P388D1 macrophages, and demonstrate that, under certain experimental settings, stimulation of the cPLA2 is sufficient to generate a prostaglandin biosynthetic response in the P388D1 macrophages.

PLA2-mediated hydrolysis of phospholipids results in the release of arachidonic (AA) and lysophospholipids, both of which may possess biological activity or serve as substrates for the generation of other bioactive lipid mediators such as the eicosanoids or platelet-activating factor (PAF) (1.Balsinde J. Balboa M.A. Insel P.A. Dennis E.A. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1999; 39: 175-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar, 2.Murakami M. Nakatani Y. Atsumi G. Inoue K. Kudo I. Crit. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 17: 225-283Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In major eicosanoid-producing immunoinflammatory cells such as macrophages and mast cells, prostaglandin production usually occurs in two phases (1.Balsinde J. Balboa M.A. Insel P.A. Dennis E.A. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1999; 39: 175-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar, 2.Murakami M. Nakatani Y. Atsumi G. Inoue K. Kudo I. Crit. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 17: 225-283Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The first phase takes place in minutes and is strikingly characterized by its dependence on Ca2+mobilization from internal stores; whereas, the second, delayed phase, spanning several hours, takes place in the absence of Ca2+elevations (2.Murakami M. Nakatani Y. Atsumi G. Inoue K. Kudo I. Crit. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 17: 225-283Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Substantial evidence suggests that specific coupling between certain PLA2 and cyclooxygenase (COX) forms accounts for the differential regulation of the immediate and delayed responses (3–14.Sawada H. Murakami M. Enomoto A. Shimbara S. Kudo I. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 263: 826-833Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Thus, depending on whether group IV cPLA2 or sPLA2 (group IIA or group V) is the provider of free AA, either COX-1 or COX-2 would be responsible for prostaglandin production. Which PLA2 form couples to which COX isoform appears also to depend critically on cell type. We have shown that the rapid, PAF receptor-mediated phase of PGE2 production in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-primed P388D1 macrophages involves group V sPLA2coupling to COX-2 (4.Balsinde J. Balboa M.A. Dennis E.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7951-7956Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). It is important to emphasize here that this response to PAF will not occur if the cells have not been first exposed to bacterial LPS for 1 h (15.Glaser K.B. Asmis R. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8658-8664Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16.Balsinde J. Balboa M.A. Insel P.A. Dennis E.A. Biochem. J. 1997; 321: 805-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Thus the P388D1 cell response to PAF is not, strictly speaking, an immediate response but rather a primed immediate one. Interestingly, we have recently discovered that group V sPLA2 also couples to COX-2 for the delayed PGE2 biosynthetic response of P388D1macrophages exposed to LPS alone (5.Shinohara H. Balboa M.A. Johnson C.A. Balsinde J. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12263-12268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 17.Balsinde J. Shinohara H. Lefkowitz L.J. Johnson C.A. Balboa M.A. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25967-25970Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Under those conditions, expression of both group V sPLA2 and COX-2 is markedly induced and correlates with ongoing AA release and prostaglandin biosynthesis, respectively (5.Shinohara H. Balboa M.A. Johnson C.A. Balsinde J. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12263-12268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), indicating that the AA produced by group V sPLA2 is used by COX-2 to produce PGE2. Importantly, expression of both group V sPLA2 and COX-2 can be abolished by pretreating the cells with the cPLA2inhibitor methyl arachidonyl fluorophosphonate, implying that a functionally active cPLA2 is essential for the delayed PGE2 response to occur (5.Shinohara H.

In the current study we have uncovered a third pathway for AA mobilization and PGE2 production in activated P388D1 macrophages that appears not to require the group V sPLA2. We show here that exposure of the cells to zymosan particles triggers the immediate release of both AA and PGE2 in a process that depends only on cPLA2and COX-2. Thus in P388D1 macrophages there are at least three different phases for AA release: an immediate phase (zymosan), which does not require the participation of the sPLA2, a primed immediate phase (LPS/PAF), which does require the sPLA2, and a delayed phase (LPS), which also requires the sPLA2. All of the three phases, however, require the cPLA2. Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium (endotoxin <0.05 ng/ml) was from Whittaker Bioproducts (Walkersville, MD). Fetal bovine serum was from Hyclone Labs. (Logan, UT). Nonessential amino acids were from Irvine Scientific (Santa Ana, CA).

P388D1 cells were plated at 106/well, allowed to adhere overnight, and used for experiments the following day. All experiments were conducted in serum-free Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium. When required, radiolabeling of the P388D1 cells with [3H]AA was achieved by including 0.5 μCi/ml [3H]AA during the overnight adherence period (20 h). Labeled AA that had not been incorporated into cellular lipids was removed by washing the cells four times with serum-free medium containing 1 mg/ml albumin. The cells were placed in serum-free medium for 30 min before the addition of zymosan for different periods of time. Afterward, the supernatants were removed and cleared of detached cells by centrifugation, and PGE2 was quantitated using a specific radioimmunoassay (PersPective Biosystems, Framingham, MA). For [3H]AA release experiments, cells labeled with [3H]AA were used, and the incubations were performed in the presence of 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. The supernatants were removed, cleared of detached cells by centrifugation, and assayed for radioactivity by liquid scintillation counting. Zymosan was prepared exactly as described (18.Balsinde J. Fernández B. Solı́s-Herruzo J.A. Diez E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1136: 75-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Briefly, zymosan particles were suspended in phosphate-buffered saline, boiled for 60 min, and washed three times. The final pellet was resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline at 20 mg/ml and stored frozen. Zymosan aliquots were diluted in serum-free medium and sonicated before addition to the cells. No PLA2activity was detected in the zymosan batches used in this study, as assessed by in vitro activity assays (19.Barbour S.E. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21875-21882Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A 20-base-long antisense corresponding to nucleotides 59–78 in the murine group VI iPLA2 sequence (20.Balboa M.A. Balsinde J. Jones S.S. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8576-8580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) was utilized (ASGVI-18, 5′-CTC CTT CAC CCG GAA TGG GT). As a control, the sense complement of ASGVI-18 was used (SGV-18, 5′-ACC CAT TCC GGG TGA AGG AG). Both ASGVI-18 and SGVI-18 contained phosphorothioate linkages to limit degradation. We have previously described a procedure of transfection that involves long incubation periods of the cells with the oligonucleotides (21.Balsinde J. Balboa M.A. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29317-29321Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). In the current study, we have employed the procedure recently described by Akiba et al. (22.Akiba S. Mizunaga S. Kume K. Hayama M. Sato T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19906-19912Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) in which the oligonucleotides are presented to the cells in a complex with a lipophilic carrier. The antisense and sense oligonucleotides were mixed with LipofectAMINE, and complexes were allowed to form at room temperature for 10–15 min. The complexes were then added to the cells, and the incubations were allowed to proceed for 24 h under standard cell culture conditions. The final concentrations of oligonucleotide and LipofectAMINE in the incubation medium were 1 μm and 10 μg/ml, respectively. Oligonucleotide treatment and culture conditions were not toxic for the cells as assessed by the Trypan blue dye exclusion assay and by quantitating adherent cell protein. The cells were lysed in a buffer consisting of 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 μm leupeptin, 20 μm aprotinin, 100 mm sodium vanadate, pH 7.5. The homogenates were centrifuged at 500 × g for 5 min at 4 °C to separate nuclei. Samples (50 μg) were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (10% acrylamide gel) and transferred to Immobilon-P (Millipore). Nonspecific binding was blocked by incubating the membranes with a buffer consisting of 5% nonfat milk, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Triton X-100 for 60 min. Membranes were then incubated with anti-iPLA2 antiserum at a 1:1000 dilution for 30 min and then treated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated protein A (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Bands were detected by enhanced chemiluminiscence (ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). After the stimulations, the cell supernatants were taken off, and the cell monolayers were scraped with 0.5% Triton X-100. Total lipids were extracted according to the method of Bligh and Dyer (23.Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (43132) Google Scholar). Lipids were separated by thin-layer chromatography with n-hexane/diethyl ether/acetic acid (70:30:1, by vol). This system allows a good resolution among phospholipids, monoacylglycerol, DAG, free fatty acids, and triacylglycerol (24.Balsinde J. Dennis E.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 235: 480-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The plates were revealed by exposing them to iodine vapors, and the spot corresponding to DAG was cut out and assayed for radioactivity by liquid scintillation counting. Except for the data in Fig. 4, zymosan-stimulated AA release is expressed by subtracting the basal rate in the absence of agonist and inhibitor. These background values were in the range 2000–3000 cpm. Assays were carried out in duplicate or triplicate. Each set of experiments was repeated at least three times with similar results. Unless otherwise indicated, the data presented are from representative experiments. We have recently reported on the use of a P388D1 cell subclone, termed MAB, which manifests considerably higher [3H]AA release responses to LPS and PAF than the ATCC cell batch from which the MAB clone was derived (5.Shinohara H. Balboa M.A. Johnson C.A. Balsinde J. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12263-12268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). We have repeatedly been unable to detect AA release in response to yeast-derived zymosan from P388D1 cell batches directly obtained from the ATCC (15.Glaser K.B. Asmis R. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8658-8664Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25.Lister M.D. Glaser K.B. Ulevitch R.J. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8520-8528Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Highlighting another striking difference between the MAB cells and their parent ATCC cells, Fig.1 A shows that the MAB cells do respond to yeast-derived zymosan by rapidly releasing [3H]AA to the extracellular medium. The concentration dependence of the effect of zymosan on [3H]AA release is shown in Fig. 1 B. Maximal effects were observed at zymosan concentrations between 0.25–0.5 mg/ml. From these data, a zymosan concentration of 0.5 mg/ml was chosen to be employed in all subsequent experiments. Fig.2 shows that the zymosan-induced AA release was strongly inhibited by MAFP a dual cPLA2/iPLA2 inhibitor. Complete inhibition of the response was observed at a MAFP concentration of 25 μm. To distinguish whether the inhibition of MAFP of AA release was because of either cPLA2 or iPLA2, we conducted studies with BEL, a compound that manifests a marked selectivity for inhibition of the iPLA2 versusthe cPLA2 (3.Balsinde J. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6758-6765Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). BEL, at concentrations that we have previously shown to block P388D1 cell iPLA2 in vitro (26.Balsinde J. Bianco I.D. Ackermann E.J. Conde-Frieboes K. Dennis E.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8527-8531Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar), had no significant effect on zymosan-stimulated AA release (Fig.3 A). Failure of BEL to inhibit the AA release was not because of the inhibitor not being able to cross the plasma membrane, because under identical experimental conditions BEL did inhibit zymosan-induced DAG production in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 3 B). The latter effect most likely reflects the inhibition by BEL of the Mg2+-dependent phosphatidate phosphohydrolase (27.Balsinde J. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31937-31941Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). In turn, the absence of an effect of BEL on zymosan-induced AA release indicates that the MAFP effects shown in Fig. 2 are because of inhibition of the cPLA2, not the iPLA2.Figure 3Effect of BEL on zymosan-induced [3H] AA release (A) and [3H] DAG accumulation (B). The cells were treated with the indicated concentrations of BEL for 30 min before the addition of zymosan (closed symbols), and the incubations proceeded for 1 h. Open circles denote control incubations, i.e. those that did not receive LPS. Afterward, AA release (A) was determined in the supernatants and DAG accumulation (B) was determined in the cell monolayers as described under “Experimental Procedures.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To further substantiate the lack of a role for the iPLA2 in zymosan-stimulated AA release, we also examined the effects of an iPLA2 antisense oligonucleotide, which we have previously used to attenuate the levels of immunoreactive iPLA2 in P388D1 cells (21.Balsinde J. Balboa M.A. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29317-29321Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Using this antisense, we detected a decrease in the immunoreactive iPLA2 protein of about 60%, as judged by Western blot (Fig.4 A). iPLA2-deficient cells, however, did not show any significant reduction of their capacity to release AA to the extracellular medium, either spontaneously or in response to zymosan (Fig. 4 B). Collectively, the data of Figs. 3 and 4 strongly suggest that the iPLA2 does not play a significant role in mediating agonist-induced AA mobilization in P388D1cells. To investigate the involvement of the sPLA2 in zymosan-stimulated AA release, we employed LY311727, a well known sPLA2 inhibitor (1.Balsinde J. Balboa M.A. Insel P.A. Dennis E.A. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1999; 39: 175-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar). Treatment of the cells with 25 μm LY311727 had no appreciable effect on the zymosan-stimulated AA release (Fig.5). We have previously shown that this treatment leads to a marked reduction of the AA release response of the cells to LPS/PAF (3.Balsinde J. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6758-6765Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). Identical results were obtained with the use of CMPE (N-derivatized phosphatidylethanolamine covalently linked via the headgroup to carboxymethyl cellulose), another sPLA2 inhibitor that is structurally unrelated to LY311727 (28.Dan P. Dagan A. Krimsky M. Pruzanski W. Vadas P. Yedgar S. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 6199-6204Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), and that we have previously shown to strongly inhibit fatty acid release in LPS-activated P388D1 macrophages (29.Balsinde J. Balboa M.A. Yedgar S. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4783-4786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In keeping with these previous data, CMPE strongly inhibited the LPS/PAF-induced AA release but had no measurable effect on the response to zymosan (data not shown). These results, together with the finding that zymosan did not increase cellular group V sPLA2mRNA levels for periods of time up to 1 h, strongly suggest that sPLA2 has no role in zymosan-stimulated AA release. The priming effect of LPS on PAF-induced AA mobilization in P388D1 cells is thought to involve the increased synthesis of group V sPLA2 (4.Balsinde J. Balboa M.A. Dennis E.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7951-7956Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 30.Balboa M.A. Balsinde J. Winstead M.V. Tischfield J.A. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32381-32384Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Interestingly LPS also primed the AA release in response to zymosan (Fig. 5). This effect was found to be inhibited by LY311727, implying the involvement of group V sPLA2 in the priming effect (Fig. 5). Likewise, the addition of exogenous group V sPLA2 to the zymosan-treated cells increased the AA release in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 6). Thus, when cellular sPLA2 levels are increased because of the LPS treatment or to the addition of exogenous enzyme, the zymosan response is accordingly increased. Collectively the data indicate that the lack of involvement of sPLA2 in the response triggered by zymosan alone is not because of zymosan suppression of endogenous sPLA2 activity. We have previously observed that in addition to COX-1, P388D1 macrophages constitutively express low levels of COX-2 (4.Balsinde J. Balboa M.A. Dennis E.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7951-7956Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 17.Balsinde J. Shinohara H. Lefkowitz L.J. Johnson C.A. Balboa M.A. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25967-25970Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Therefore it was of interest to examine which of these COX isoforms participates in the prostaglandin response of the cells to zymosan. Neither COX-1 nor COX-2 levels were changed during incubation of the cells for 1 h with zymosan, as assessed by immunoblot. We studied the effect of NS-398, a compound that inhibits COX-2 with an IC50 <5 μm, whereas COX-1 remains unaffected at concentrations higher than 100 μm (31.Futaki N. Takahashi S. Yokoyama M. Arai I. Higuchi S. Otomo S. Prostaglandins. 1994; 47: 55-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (801) Google Scholar). Fig.7 shows complete inhibition of zymosan-induced PGE2 production by NS-398, which indicates that COX-2 is responsible for the response. We have recently identified in P388D1 macrophages (MAB clone) the existence of two distinct pathways for AA mobilization and prostaglandin production. The first one, herein referred to as the “primed immediate phase” takes place in minutes and is elicited by the Ca2+-mobilizing agonist PAF but requires the cells to be exposed first to LPS for 1 h (3.Balsinde J.

A. 1994; 91: 11060-11064Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The second pathway, or “delayed phase,” is elicited by LPS for periods of time spanning several hours (4.Balsinde J. Balboa M.A. Dennis E.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7951-7956Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 5.Shinohara H. Balboa M.A. Johnson C.A. Balsinde J. Dennis E.A. J. Biol.

Interestingly, both pathways utilize the same effectors, namely cPLA2, sPLA2, and COX-2, although the molecular mechanisms involved dramatically differ (3.Balsinde J. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6758-6765Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar, 4.Balsinde J. Balboa M.A. Dennis E.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1999; 274: 36764-36768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In both of these routes the cPLA2appears to behave primarily as an initiator of the response, whereas the sPLA2 plays an augmentative role by providing most of the AA to be converted to prostaglandins via COX-2. In the current study we show that zymosan triggers AA mobilization and prostaglandin synthesis in the P388D1 macrophages by a pathway that is clearly different from the ones identified for LPS and PAF. Thus, zymosan elicits an “immediate” AA response whose unique features are that (i) it does not cease after a few minutes but goes on for longer times, (ii) takes place in the absence of LPS priming, and (iii) utilizes only the cPLA2 to effect the AA release. In common with the response to PAF, however, prostaglandin production in the zymosan-stimulated cells is also mediated by COX-2. Thus, in zymosan-stimulated cells cPLA2 couples directly to COX-2 for prostaglandin production. This is strikingly different from the situation in the PAF-stimulated cells, where the bulk of the prostaglandins is produced by a sPLA2/COX-2 coupling mechanism (4.Balsinde J. Balboa M.A. Dennis E.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7951-7956Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Exposure of the P388D1 macrophages to LPS increases group V sPLA2 levels in a concentration-dependent manner and this appears to constitute a key event of LPS priming (5.Shinohara H. Balboa M.A. Johnson C.A. Balsinde J. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12263-12268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar,30.Balboa M.A. Balsinde J. Winstead M.V. Tischfield J.A. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32381-32384Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). We have found here that zymosan does not trigger the increased synthesis of new sPLA2. However, resting cells still contain appreciable amounts of sPLA2 (30.Balboa M.A. Balsinde J. Winstead M.V. Tischfield J.A. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32381-32384Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Thus it is not easy to envision the reasons for the zymosan not to signal to AA release via recruitment of the endogenous sPLA2 already present in the cell. We have previously observed that the sPLA2 pool located on the cell surface appears to be involved in the LPS/PAF-induced AA mobilization and prostaglandin production (19.Barbour S.E. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21875-21882Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30.Balboa M.A. Balsinde J. Winstead M.V. Tischfield J.A. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32381-32384Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). sPLA2 levels on the surface of the LPS/PAF-activated cells are higher than in resting unstimulated cells (4.Balsinde J. Balboa M.A. Dennis E.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7951-7956Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 30.Balboa M.A. Balsinde J. Winstead M.V. Tischfield J.A. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32381-32384Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). This increased sPLA2 expression can be blocked by actinomycin D (4.Balsinde J. Balboa M.A. Dennis E.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7951-7956Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar), indicating the involvement of de novoprotein synthesis. We have failed to detect an increase in group V sPLA2 mRNA levels in cells stimulated by zymosan for periods of time up to 1 h. Thus, a tempting but yet speculative idea to explain the lack of sPLA2 involvement in the zymosan response would be that the stimulus fails to recruit the constitutive sPLA2 to the appropriate cell compartment,i.e. the cell surface. Interestingly, a recent report has shown that a major portion of the group V sPLA2 that murine mast cells constitutively express is found intracellularly located during the resting state (34.Bingham C.O. Fijneman R.J.A. Friend D.S. Goddeau R.P. Rogers R.A. Austen K.F. Arm J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31476-31484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). P388D1 macrophages contain a third PLA2 type, the group VI iPLA2. By using chemical inhibitors and antisense approaches, we have shown that this enzyme does not seem to participate in the stimulation of AA release by zymosan. In agreement with our data, Akiba et al. (22.Akiba S. Mizunaga S. Kume K. Hayama M. Sato T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19906-19912Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) recently reported that MAFP strongly inhibits the zymosan-stimulated AA release in P388D1 cells. Interestingly, Akiba et al. (22.Akiba S. Mizunaga S. Kume K. Hayama M. Sato T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19906-19912Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) also showed that low BEL concentrations (2 μm) partially decreased the AA release (up to 40%). This finding led the authors to suggest that, in addition to the cPLA2, the iPLA2 is also involved in the response. At 2 μm, no effect of BEL on DAG levels was detected but an inhibitory effect on the response became evident at 5 μm, which is in agreement with the results of our study. The discrepancy between the data by Akiba et al. (22.Akiba S. Mizunaga S. Kume K. Hayama M. Sato T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19906-19912Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) and ours regarding BEL effects on AA release probably arises from the fact that Akiba et al. (22.Akiba S. Mizunaga S. Kume K. Hayama M. Sato T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19906-19912Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) have used a heterogeneous P388D1 cell population for their studies, whereas we have employed a clone of these cells, termed MAB (5.Shinohara H.

Johnson C.A. Balboa M.A. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25967-25970Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Closer examination of the results by Akibaet al. (22.Akiba S. Mizunaga S. Kume K. Hayama M. Sato T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19906-19912Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) reveals that the concentration-response curves for the inhibitory effects of BEL on zymosan-stimulated AA release and endogenous iPLA2 activity do not correspond (cf.Fig. 2, A and B, in Ref. 22.Akiba S. Mizunaga S. Kume K. Hayama M. Sato T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19906-19912Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Maximal effects of BEL on AA release are found at 2 μm, but at this concentration, endogenous iPLA2 activity is only inhibited by 40%; BEL concentrations higher than 10 μm were found to be required for full iPLA2 inhibition (22.Akiba S. Mizunaga S. Kume K. Hayama M. Sato T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19906-19912Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Thus, the BEL effects on zymosan-induced AA release reported by Akiba et al. (22.Akiba S. Mizunaga S. Kume K. Hayama M. Sato T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19906-19912Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) are likely not because of inhibition of the iPLA2 but of another unidentified effector. Akiba et al. (22.Akiba S. Mizunaga S. Kume K. Hayama M. Sato T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19906-19912Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) also utilized antisense technology to study the role of iPLA2 in their system. Surprisingly however, the functional consequences of iPLA2 antisense depletion were investigated on prostaglandin D2 production, not on the more direct analysis of AA release (22.Akiba S. Mizunaga S. Kume K. Hayama M. Sato T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19906-19912Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). A potential problem with measuring prostaglandin as a marker of phospholipase activation (22.Akiba S. Mizunaga S. Kume K. Hayama M. Sato T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19906-19912Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) is that any effect at step(s) distal from the phospholipolytic step cannot be distinguished from effects at the phospholipolytic step itself. We have confirmed in this study that the experimental conditions employed by Akiba et al. (22.Akiba S. Mizunaga S. Kume K. Hayama M. Sato T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19906-19912Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) result in a decrease in cellular iPLA2, as assessed by immunoblot. We have also found that iPLA2 depletion by antisense does not result in a decreased capacity of the cells to release AA to the incubation medium in response to zymosan. We previously observed that iPLA2 depletion by the same antisense oligonucleotide also has no effect on the AA release response induced by LPS/PAF (21.Balsinde J. Balboa M.A. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29317-29321Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Our previous studies have suggested that the iPLA2 serves in a phospholipid remodeling role that involves the generation of lysophospholipid precursors for incorporation of AA into phospholipids (35.Balsinde J. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16069-16072Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Such a housekeeping function for the iPLA2 was deduced from experiments involving inhibition of iPLA2activity with BEL (26.Balsinde J. Bianco I.D. Ackermann E.J. Conde-Frieboes K. Dennis E.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8527-8531Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar, 36.Balsinde J. Dennis E.A. Adv. Exp. Med.

Chem. 1997; 272: 29317-29321Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Importantly, our data have now been confirmed and extended by other laboratories (37.Baburina I. Jackowski S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9400-9408Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 38.Alzola E. Pérez-Etxebarria A. Kabré E. Fogarty D.J. Métioui M. Chaib N.

Thus the role of iPLA2 in regulating basal phospholipid deacylation/reacylation reactions appears not to be restricted to the P388D1 cells but rather may represent a general homeostatic mechanism for the regulation of phospholipid levels. However, a recent study in pancreatic islets failed to detect a role for the iPLA2 in basal AA incorporation into the phospholipids of these cells (41.Ramanadham S. Hsu F.F. Bohrer A. Ma Z. Turk J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13915-13927Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). It is important to note that, as the authors themselves acknowledge (41.Ramanadham S. Hsu F.F. Bohrer A. Ma Z. Turk J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13915-13927Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), pancreatic islets exhibit some atypical features of AA incorporation in that the basal levels of both esterified AA and lysophospholipid in these cells are substantially higher than in other tissues (41.Ramanadham S. Hsu F.F. Bohrer A. Ma Z. Turk J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13915-13927Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Given the high levels and apparently slow turnover of lysophosphatidylcholine in these cells (41.Ramanadham S. Hsu F.F. Bohrer A. Ma Z. Turk J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13915-13927Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), the finding that lysophosphatidylcholine levels do not limit AA incorporation into islet phospholipids does not come as a surprise. Whether the observations with pancreatic islets represent another mechanism for incorporation of AA into phospholipids or merely reflect atypical features of a particular cell type is not yet certain. In summary, we have described in this work the existence of a third, immediate pathway for AA mobilization and prostaglandin production that operates via activation of the cPLA2 coupled to COX-2. Neither group V sPLA2 nor group VI iPLA2 appear to be involved. While this manuscript was under review, a report appeared (Gijón, M. A., Spencer, D. M., Siddiqi, A. R., Bonventre, J. V., and Leslie, C. C. (2000) J. Biol. Chem. 275, 20146–20156) showing that in macrophages obtained from cPLA2 knock-out mice, zymosan was unable to induce AA release. These results are fully consistent with the data presented in this manuscript and confirm the usefulness of the P388D1cells as a model for macrophage activation studies. We thank Dr. Satoshi Akiba (Kyoto Pharmaceutical University, Japan) for helpful discussions during the course of this work and Dr. Michelle Winstead for reading the manuscript."

Each of these genes is transcribed in a tissue-specific manner, and alternate splicing results in at least six different isoforms. SERCA1a is expressed in adult fast-twitch skeletal muscle (1Stewart P. MacLennan D. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 712-719Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar, 2MacLennan D.H. Brandl C.J. Korczak B.

Although SERCA2b protein is detected in the heart tissue, it has not been shown to be expressed specifically in cardiac myocytes, and the role of SERCA2b in muscle has never been clearly defined. For example, in pancreatic and salivary gland cells, specific and polarized expression of SERCA isoforms has been observed (8Lee M.G. Xu X. Zeng W. Diaz J. Kuo T.H. Wuytack F. Racymaekers L. Muallem S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15771-15776Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). In pancreatic acinar cells, SERCA2a is found in the luminal pole, whereas SERCA2b is expressed in the basal pole and nuclear envelope. In salivary gland cells, SERCA2b is found in the luminal pole, whereas SERCA3 is expressed in the basal pole. By analogy to its role in other cell types, SERCA2b might be expected to play such a unique role in cardiac myocytes. No such intracellular compartmentalization or specialized role has yet been shown.SERCA2b has specific structural and functional properties that might facilitate a specialized role in cardiac myocyte calcium handling. The SERCA2b isoform is identical to SERCA2a except for the carboxyl terminus. The four COOH-terminal amino acids of SERCA2a are replaced by an extended hydrophobic sequence of 49 amino acids in SERCA2b (9Campbell A.M. Kessler P.D. Sagara Y. Inesi G. Fambrough D.M. J. Biol.

By measuring calcium-dependent calcium uptake at various Ca2+ concentrations, SERCA2b was shown to have a higher apparent Ca2+ affinity (K 0.5) than SERCA2a. Verboomen et al. (13Verboomen H.

The enzymatic turnover rate has been assessed for these two SERCA isoforms by measurement of oxalate-facilitated Ca2+ uptake during the linear portion of the uptake curve normalized to total covalent phosphorylated enzyme intermediate (E-P). Enzymatic turnover for SERCA2b in a COS expression system is about 0.5 times that of SERCA2a (11Lytton J. Westlin M. Burk S.E. Shull G.E. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol.

With this as motivation we sought to answer the question: what is the role of SERCA2b in cardiac myocytes, cells that express SERCA2a at much higher levels? Why is SERCA2b expression required in these cells, and what, if any, specific function does SERCA2b have? Overexpression of SERCA isoforms in the heart or in isolated cardiac myocytes provides a powerful model system to assess the specific functional role of these molecules in muscle contraction and relaxation (14He H.

Although SERCA2b has been termed the housekeeping isoform, its essential role in heart is virtually unknown. In fact, it has not been previously demonstrated that SERCA2b is expressed in cardiac myocytes as opposed to non-cardiac cells. In addition, it is not known whether SERCA2b is physically associated with subcompartments of the SR, or whether its intracellular localization differs from that of SERCA2a. To test this hypothesis in an animal model, we have generated transgenic mice that overexpress SERCA2b and studied their structural and functional differences from wild-type controls.RESULTSWe have generated mice that overexpress a SERCA2b transgene under the control of cardiac α-MHC gene promoter (21Subramaniam A. Jones W.K. Gulick J. Wert S. Neumann J. Robbins J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24613-24620Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This promoter has been demonstrated to drive high levels of expression of a variety of transgenes in the postnatal mouse heart, and has been successfully used to overexpress two other SERCA isoforms in our laboratory (15Baker D. Hashimoto K. Grupp I. Ji Y. Reed T. Loukianov E. Grupp G. Bhagwhat A. Hoit B. Walsh R. Marban E. Periasamy M. Circ. Res. 1998; 83: 1205-1214Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 16Loukianov E.

We used the rat SERCA2b cDNA (20Gunteski-Hamblin A.M. Greeb J. Shull G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15032-15040Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (gift of Dr. Gary Shull), which is nearly identical to that of the mouse. The SERCA2b transgene construct includes the entire coding and 3′-untranslated region of the rat SERCA2b cDNA (5 kilobase pairs) downstream of the (∼5.5-kilobase pair) α-MHC promoter and followed by an additional polyadenylation signal sequence from the human growth hormone gene.Southern blot analysis using tail clips from the founders (F0) indicated that 7 out of 59 initial F0 mice carried the transgene (lines 1, 21, 22, 25, 44, and 54). Southern blotting showed that three of the lines (25, 44, and 54) had high copy numbers (approximately 30 copies) (Fig. 1) of the transgene and were chosen for this study. Transgenic lines that had low copy numbers of the transgene (one or two copies) were not analyzed.Steady state levels of endogenous mouse SERCA2a and transgenic SERCA2b mRNA were quantified in SERCA2b transgenic and wild-type litter mate hearts by an RNase protection assay. Probes derived from genomic sequences encoding the 3′-untranslated regions of the two isoforms allowed unambiguous detection of each SERCA isoform. Fig.2 shows two representative non-transgenic mice compared with three SERCA2b transgenic littermates. Quantitation of signals after normalization with GAPDH mRNA revealed that the steady-state level of SERCA2b mRNA was increased approximately 20-fold in SERCA2b transgenic mice compared with wild-type littermate mice. There was no significant down-regulation of endogenous SERCA2a mRNA in SERCA2b transgenic animals.Figure 2Detection of transgene expression in cardiac-derived RNA by RNase protection analysis. The upper band corresponds to SERCA2b mRNA, which is ∼20-fold higher in TG hearts, and the lower band to SERCA2a mRNA, which is not significantly altered when normalized with GAPDH mRNA.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Western blotting analysis was performed on membrane preparations isolated from homogenates of hearts from of each of the three high copy number SERCA2b transgenic lines. An antibody specific to SERCA2b (24Eggermont J.A. Wuytack F. Verbist J. Casteels R. Biochem. J. 1990; 271: 649-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) was used to identify the level of this isoform. This SERCA2b-specific antibody was produced by immunizing rabbits with a synthetic peptide derived from the unique 49-amino acid COOH-terminal tail of SERCA2b and is therefore highly specific for this isoform. Quantification of blots revealed that SERCA2b protein is increased approximately 8–10-fold over control hearts in transgenic lines 25, 44, and 54 (Fig.3 A). On the same Western blot, staining for tubulin was used as a control and did not show any major changes in the hearts of transgenic animals. Duplicate immunoblots were stained with an antibody specific for SERCA2a isoform. These blots showed that there were no large changes in the expression level of endogenous SERCA2a protein (Fig. 3 B). Sarcomeric actin was also used as an internal control. It is evident that there were no significant changes in sarcomeric actin expression in the transgenic animals.Figure 3Western blot analysis of SERCA2a and SERCA2b protein expression in the hearts of transgenic and wild-type mice. A, microsomes from SERCA2b transgenic (left side) and non-transgenic littermates (right side) were loaded on SDS-polyacrylamide gels in the amounts indicated. After transfer to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, the membranes were cut horizontally and the upper half blotted with anti-SERCA2b polyclonal antibody and the lower half blotted with a monoclonal anti-tubulin antibody. Blots from three different transgenic lines are shown. B, identically prepared blots were probed with anti-SERCA2a polyclonal antibody and a monoclonal antibody against sarcomeric actin.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)These same highly specific polyclonal antibodies against SERCA2a and SERCA2b were used to perform immunostaining and confocal microscopy on fixed, isolated myocytes from both wild-type and mice overexpressing SERCA2b (Fig. 4). Immunostaining showed that SERCA2b distributes horizontally in a highly organized pattern and has the same general distribution as α-actinin. This staining pattern suggests that SERCA2b is localized near the transverse tubules (T-tubules) in the SR that overlie the myofilament Z lines, as delineated by the control staining with α-actinin. In comparison with SERCA2b staining (Fig. 4), SERCA2a staining was not localized only near the T-tubular area, but was also distributed longitudinally. This may suggest that SERCA2a is localized both around the terminal SR (near the T-tubules) and in the so-called free or longitudinal SR that surrounds the myofilament bundles. Although the immunostaining images cannot exclude the presence of SERCA2b in the longitudinal SR, at a similar overall intensity of staining of the transverse elements of the SR, there is little or no staining of longitudinal elements observable with the SERCA2b antibody. Staining of both wild-type myocytes and SERCA2b transgenic myocytes for SERCA2b showed a very similar overall staining pattern.Figure 4Confocal microscopic images of immunostained cardiac myocytes from SERCA2b transgenic (top row) and wild-type (bottom row) mice. The first andthird columns of images are stained with antibodies specific for SERCA2b and SERCA2a, respectively. Both SERCA antibodies are rabbit polyclonal. A secondary fluorescein-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody was used to detect this primary antibody.Second and fourth columns are images from the same cells shown in columns one andthree, respectively, but stained with mouse monoclonal antibody against α-actinin. A goat anti-mouse rhodamine-conjugated antibody was used to detect α-actinin staining.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)There was no difference in heart/body weight ratio in SERCA2b transgenic mice versus non-transgenic littermates, suggesting that significant cardiac hypertrophy is absent in the SERCA2b transgenic mice. Histologic analysis of hearts from lines 25, 44, and 54 also revealed no evidence of myocyte hypertrophy or fibrosis (data not shown).In order to determine the effect of overexpression of the SERCA2b protein on SR Ca2+ transport, the initial rate of oxalate-facilitated Ca2+ uptake was measured in cardiac homogenates from SERCA2b transgenic and non-transgenic hearts, using45Ca2+ as a tracer (Fig.5). There was no change in the maximal velocity of calcium uptake when normalized for total homogenate protein between wild-type and TG hearts (V max for TG: 60.16 ± 4.89 nmol of Ca2+/mg of protein/min; for NTG, 60.91 ± 3.37 nmol of Ca2+/mg of protein/min). There was, however, a significant leftward shift in the calcium uptake curve. The K 0.5 of SR Ca2+ uptake occurred at a much lower Ca2+ concentration in SERCA2b-overexpressing mice compared with controls (TG, 0.199 ± 0.011 μm; NTG, 0.269 ± 0.012 μm). This suggests that enzymatically active SERCA2b was indeed expressed in the hearts of the SERCA2b transgenic mice and it can alter the apparent pump affinity for calcium.Figure 5Calcium uptake rate in homogenates from SERCA2b TG and NTG mouse hearts. Data points represent the mean ± S.E. of 6 uptake determinations for each point.Panel A, calcium uptake is normalized to total homogenate proteins.

Compared with wild-type FVB/N control littermates, the SERCA2b transgenic hearts had significantly increased +dP/dt (+40%) and lower TPP, consistent with improved contractility. The −dP/dt was significantly increased (+30%), and RT 1/2 was reduced suggestive of improved diastolic function as well.Figure 6Work-performing heart mechanics in hearts from SERCA2b transgenic and wild-type mice.

In this study, we have overexpressed SERCA2b in cardiomyocytes of the mouse heart. The SERCA2b transgenic mice overexpress SERCA2b mRNA approximately 20-fold in the heart as compared with wild-type littermates. The SERCA2b protein level is increased ∼8–10-fold in the heart. At the same time, there is little change in the amount of endogenous SERCA2a protein level. This is in contrast to mice that overexpress SERCA1 (fast twitch skeletal muscle-specific isoform), in which there is a 50% down-regulation of SERCA2a protein in cardiac myocytes (16Loukianov E. Ji Y. Grupp I.L. Kirkpatrick D.L. Baker D.L. Loukianova T. Grupp G. Lytton J. Walsh R.A. Periasamy M. Circ. Res. 1998; 83: 889-897Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 28Grupp I.L. Subramaniam A. Hewett T.E. Robbins J. Grupp G. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: H1401-H1410PubMed Google Scholar). This may indicate that SERCA2a and SERCA2b do not compete for the same “sites” within the sarcoplasmic reticulum. This is further corroborated by the immunostaining of isolated myocytes using SERCA2a- and SERCA2b-specific antibodies, which shows distinct distribution for these two isoforms. Our results suggest that SERCA2b is localized in a subcompartment of the SR (terminal SR) near the transverse tubules (T-tubules) as delineated by the control staining with α-actinin. On the other hand, SERCA2a staining was observed both transversely and longitudinally. This strongly suggests that there is compartmentalization of the SR with regard to the distribution of SERCA2a and SERCA2b isoforms.The difference between the two SERCA2 isoforms lies in the carboxyl-terminal tail (50 amino acids in SERCA2b and 4 amino acids in SERCA2a). This suggests that one of the roles of extended carboxyl-terminal of SERCA2b may be to limit its distribution in the SR membrane. The extended SERCA2b carboxyl-terminal tail may result in an additional membrane span for the enzyme compared with SERCA2a. Because the SERCA2b carboxyl-terminal is in the SR lumen (10Campbell A.M. Kessler P.D. Fambrough D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9321-9325Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), there is an opportunity for additional protein-protein interactions to occur, which may regulate the ATPase activity and its location. Thus, the COOH-terminal sequence difference between SERCA2a and SERCA2b may affect both the enzymatic properties and the intracellular localization of the protein.When expressed in a COS cell system, SERCA2b has a higher apparent Ca2+ affinity and lower enzymatic turnover rate than SERCA2a (11Lytton J. Westlin M. Burk S.E. Shull G.E. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14483-14489Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Verboomen H. Wuytack F. Van den Bosch L. Mertens L. Casteels R. Biochem. J. 1994; 303: 979-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The SR Ca2+ uptake measurement in SERCA2b transgenic hearts show that there is a higher apparent affinity for Ca2+ as compared with that of wild-type littermates. The magnitude of this shift in Ca2+ affinity suggests that overexpressed SERCA2b is functional in transgenic hearts. We do not see, however, a significant change in the maximal rate of Ca2+ uptake (V max) in SERCA2b transgenic hearts. The observation that SERCA2b has 2-fold slower enzymatic turnover rate compared with SERCA2a suggests one explanation for this phenomenon (11Lytton J. Westlin M. Burk S.E. Shull G.E. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14483-14489Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Verboomen H. Wuytack F. Van den Bosch L. Mertens L. Casteels R. Biochem.

J. 1992; 286: 591-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). If SERCA2b transports Ca2+ at a significantly slower rate than SERCA2a, an increase in SERCA2b over its basal level may not have a significant effect on the observedV max of Ca2+ uptake. However, SERCA2b overexpression results in enhanced rate of Ca2+uptake at lower Ca2+ concentrations, as observed by a leftward shift in the apparent affinity for Ca2+. These data demonstrate that SERCA2b is inserted into cardiac SR membranes and can contribute to SR calcium transport.If SERCA2b is an important determinant of diastolic calcium levels and the rate of calcium reuptake into the SR, an increase in the relative abundance of SERCA2b should affect intrinsic cardiac performance. We therefore used the isolated work-performing heart preparation to measure intrinsic myocardial contractility in the SERC2b overexpressing lines. The SERCA2b lines exhibit a significant increase in both base-line systolic and diastolic cardiac function, as compared with wild-type littermate control mice. This increase in intrinsic myocardial performance suggests that SERCA2b may play an important role in the regulation of cardiac contractility.Our studies on SERCA overexpression and SERCA2 knockout (+/−) mice reveal that a alteration in SERCA pump level results in an increase or decrease in myocardial contractile function (15Baker D. Hashimoto K. Grupp I. Ji Y. Reed T. Loukianov E. Grupp G. Bhagwhat A. Hoit B. Walsh R. Marban E. Periasamy M. Circ. Res. 1998; 83: 1205-1214Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 16Loukianov E.

Chem. 1999; 274: 2556-2562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). These changes in contractility can be correlated with increase or decrease in SERCA protein level in the heart and with corresponding changes in SR calcium uptake. It appears therefore that the level of functional SERCA protein in the SR is one of the fundamental determinants of cardiac contractility. In conclusion, our results showing that increased expression of SERCA2b can increase intrinsic myocardial contractility suggest that SERCA2b may play an important role in determining in vivo cardiac contractility. The sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA)1 family of proteins is encoded by three separate genes: SERCA1,SERCA2, and SERCA3. Each of these genes is transcribed in a tissue-specific manner, and alternate splicing results in at least six different isoforms. SERCA1a is expressed in adult fast-twitch skeletal muscle (1Stewart P. MacLennan D. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 712-719Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar, 2MacLennan D.H. Brandl C.J. Korczak B.

MacLennan D.H. Cell. 1986; 44: 597-607Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar). SERCA2b, the so-called “housekeeping” isoform, is expressed virtually in every cell type (4Lytton J. Zarain-Herzberg A. Periasamy M. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 7059-7065Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Zarain-Herzberg A. MacLennan D.H. Periasamy M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 4670-4677Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The SERCA3 isoforms are expressed in specialized non-muscle cells (6Papp B. Enyedi A. Paszty K. Kovacs T. Sarkadi B. Gardos G.

SERCA2b is ubiquitously expressed; it is responsible for maintaining intracellular Ca2+ stores and plays an important role in regulating Ca2+ signaling in vital tissues including neurons, pancreas, and other secretory cells. Although SERCA2b protein is detected in the heart tissue, it has not been shown to be expressed specifically in cardiac myocytes, and the role of SERCA2b in muscle has never been clearly defined. For example, in pancreatic and salivary gland cells, specific and polarized expression of SERCA isoforms has been observed (8Lee M.G. Xu X. Zeng W. Diaz J. Kuo T.H. Wuytack F. Racyma"
https://openalex.org/W2090236851,"Evi27 is a common site of retroviral integration in BXH2 murine myeloid leukemias. Here we show that integration at Evi27 occurs in a CpG island ∼6 kb upstream from a novel gene (designated Evi27) with homology to the IL17 receptor (Il17r) and that proviral integrations result in increased expression of the Evi27 protein on the cell surface. The human EVI27 homolog was also cloned and mapped to chromosome 3p21. Multiple Evi27 isoforms were detected at the RNA and protein level in both human and mouse, indicating that Evi27 expression is complex. Some of the isoforms are shown to likely represent secreted soluble forms of the protein produced by intron incorporation or by proteolytic cleavage. In the mouse, highest Evi27 expression occurs in liver and testes with lower expression in kidney and lung. In humans, EVI27 is expressed at high levels in the kidney, with moderate levels in the liver, brain, and testes. Within hematopoietic cells, Evi27 expression is restricted. Northern and Western analysis showed that Evi27 is expressed in selected T-cell, B-cell and myeloid cell lines. These results suggest that Evi27 expression is tightly regulated during hematopoietic differentiation. Collectively, these studies identify a new member of the cytokine receptor family whose increased and uncoordinated expression may lead to myeloid leukemia by altering Evi27's normal ability to control the growth and/or differentiation of hematopoietic cells."

Phosphorylation of G protein-coupled receptors regulates signaling through multiple mechanisms including receptor desensitization, which attenuates second messenger responses. In the case of phospholipase C-linked receptors, phosphorylation has been demonstrated to promote desensitization based on observations that receptors lacking the corresponding phosphorylation sites display sustained phosphoinositide hydrolysis responses relative to wild-type receptors (8Alblas J. van Etten I.

Although desensitization of 5-HT2C receptor-mediated responses has been observed in assays that examine phosphoinositide hydrolysis (7Westphal R.S. Backstrom J.R. Sanders-Bush E. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 48: 200-205PubMed Google Scholar, 17Briddon S.J. Leslie R.A. Elliott J.M. Br. J.

Cell Calcium. 1995; 17: 120-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), and Ca2+-activated currents (20Boddeke H.W. Hoffman B.J. Palacios J.M. Hoyer D. Naunyn-Schmiedebergs Arch. Pharmacol. 1993; 348: 221-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), it is unknown whether phosphorylation of the 5-HT2C receptor is involved in desensitization. To address this issue, we identified a 5-HT2C receptor domain that is required for receptor phosphorylation and performed functional assays with phosphorylation-deficient receptor mutants. First, we determined that phosphorylation of the 5-HT2C receptor requires the carboxyl-terminal PDZ (PSD-95 discs-largeZO-1) recognition motif, a domain present in nonedited and edited isoforms of the 5-HT2C receptor. Next, we found that phosphorylation-deficient receptors display identical initial responses as the wild-type 5-HT2C receptor in phosphoinositide hydrolysis and calcium release assays. However, phosphorylation-deficient receptors exhibit diminished secondary responses and a delayed recovery relative to wild-type 5-HT2C receptors. Cells stably expressing 5-HT2C receptors with a single serine-to-alanine mutation also display decreased receptor phosphorylation and diminished secondary calcium responses. We therefore propose that 5-HT2C receptor phosphorylation promotes resensitization of 5-HT2C receptor-mediated responses. The production, purification, and characterization of anti-peptide antibodies against rat 5-HT2C receptors have been described (21Backstrom J.R. Westphal R.S. Canton H. Sanders-Bush E. Mol. Brain Res. 1995; 33: 311-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 22Backstrom J.R. Sanders-Bush E. J. Neurosci. Methods. 1997; 77: 109-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Antibodies against a region of the third intracellular loop (referred to below as anti-2C-IC antibodies) were generated against amino acids 270–288 (NH2-CKKNGGEEENAPNPNPDQK-COOH) of the rat sequence and purified against a shorter peptide (NH2-CKKNGGEEENAPN-COOH). Antibodies against a region of the carboxyl terminus (referred to below as anti-2C-CT antibodies) were generated against amino acids 419–435 of the rat sequence (NH2-RHTNERVARKANDPEPGC-COOH, with cysteine added to the carboxyl terminus of peptide) and purified against the same peptide. Mutant 5-HT2C receptors were generated from wild-type rat receptor cDNA (INI isoform) (2Burns C.M. Chu H. Rueter S.M. Hutchinson L.K. Canton H. Sanders-Bush E. Emeson R.B. Nature. 1997; 387: 303-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (860) Google Scholar) using recombinant Pfupolymerase (Promega, Madison, WI), a forward primer (primer 16.3, 5′-TTGGCATTGTATTCTTTGTGTTTCTGA-3′), and a reverse primer containing anXbaI site. For mutants lacking the PDZ recognition motif (ΔPDZ), polymerase chain reaction was performed with primer 16.3 and the reverse primer 5′-TGTCTAGATTTAAATCCTCTCGCTGACCACATTAG-3′. For the S458A and S459A mutants, two rounds of polymerase chain reaction were performed with primer 16.3 and overlapping reverse primers. The first round was performed with primer 16.3 and 5′-TTACACACTGGCAATCCTCTCGCTGACCACATTAGA-3′ (S458A) or 5′-TTACACGGCACTAATCCTCTCGCTGACCACATT-3′ (S459A), and the second round with primer 16.3 and 5′-TGTCTAGATATTACACACTGGCAATCCTCTCGCT-3′ (S458AXba) or 5′-TGTCTAGAATTTACACGGCACTAATCCTCTCGCT-3′ (S459AXba). For mutants lacking the carboxyl terminus except for the immunodominant region of the 2C-CT epitope and the conserved cysteine (Δ375/CT), two rounds of polymerase chain reaction were performed as described in detail elsewhere. 1J. R. Backstrom, manuscript in preparation. Amplified DNA was digested with StuI and XbaI and ligated into the StuI/XbaI sites of the wild-type 5-HT2C receptor cDNA in a Bluescript plasmid (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Sequences were confirmed by automated sequencing at the Core Facility of the Center for Molecular Neuroscience at Vanderbilt University. Receptor cDNA was isolated from the Bluescript plasmid with KpnI and XbaI and ligated into the mammalian expression plasmid pCMV2 (a gift of Dr. David Russell). The carboxyl-terminal sequences of wild-type, ΔPDZ, Δ375/CT, S458A, and S459A 5-HT2Creceptors are illustrated in Fig. 1. NIH 3T3 fibroblasts were transiently transfected with wild-type or mutant 5-HT2C receptor cDNA to determine whether the cellular distribution of mutant receptors differed from that of wild-type 5-HT2C receptors. Fibroblasts electroporated with 25 μg of receptor cDNA were seeded in eight-well Lab-Tek II chamber slides (Nalge Nunc International, Naperville, IL) containing Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM2; Life Technologies, Inc.) with 9% bovine serum (Hyclone Laboratories, Logan, UT), 5 units/ml penicillin, and 5 μg/ml streptomycin (Life Technologies, Inc.). Cells were incubated at 37 °C in a humid chamber containing 5% CO2 for 2 days. The medium was discarded and replaced with phosphate-buffered saline containing freshly prepared 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde and 4% (w/v) sucrose. After 15 min, fixative was discarded and replaced with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100 (Sigma). After an additional 15 min, the medium was discarded, and the wells were washed once with Tris-buffered saline (TBS; 50 mmTris, pH 7.6, and 150 mm NaCl) containing 2% bovine serum albumin (BSA; Sigma) before adding a second aliquot of TBS/BSA. Slides were incubated at 4 °C for 1–2 days to block nonspecific sites. Primary antibodies against the 5-HT2C receptor (anti-2C-IC or anti-2C-CT) at a final concentration of 0.5 μg/ml in TBS containing 1% BSA were added to wells and incubated for 2 h at room temperature. After three washes with TBS, Cy3-labeled donkey anti-rabbit antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA) at a dilution of 1:1000 in TBS containing 1% BSA was added to wells and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. After three washes with TBS and two washes with water, slides were dried and coverslipped with Aqua PolyMount (Polysciences, Inc., Warrington, PA). Confocal images were captured with a Zeiss LSM410 confocal microscope in the Cell Imaging Core at Vanderbilt University. Stable clones were derived from transfection of NIH 3T3 fibroblasts with rat wild-type (INI isoform) (2Burns C.M. Chu H. Rueter S.M. Hutchinson L.K. Canton H. Sanders-Bush E. Emeson R.B. Nature. 1997; 387: 303-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (860) Google Scholar) or mutant 5-HT2C receptor cDNA. Mutant receptor cDNA (25 μg) was co-electroporated with empty pcDNA3 plasmid (0.3 μg; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), and cells were selected with G418 (Geneticin, Life Technologies, Inc.). Stable cell lines were grown in DMEM containing 9% bovine serum, 0.5 mg/ml G418, 5 units/ml penicillin, and 5 μg/ml streptomycin. Positive clones were identified by immunocytochemistry. Mutant clones with receptor levels similar to the wild-type 5-HT2C receptor cell line were utilized in subsequent functional assays. Mutant ΔPDZ receptors demonstrated identical affinities for the agonists serotonin (5-HT), 2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodoamphetamine (DOI), and lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) as wild-type 5-HT2C receptors in competition binding experiments with [3H]mesulergine (data not illustrated). Cells grown in the presence of serum were washed four times with serum-free DMEM and replaced with 5 ml of DMEM. Tunicamycin (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) was added to a final concentration of 2 μg/ml of medium (7Westphal R.S. Backstrom J.R. Sanders-Bush E. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 48: 200-205PubMed Google Scholar). After 6 h, agonist was added, and incubation was continued for an additional 15 min at 37 °C. Cell supernatants were discarded and replaced with 1 ml of phosphate/EDTA (PE) extraction buffer (50 mmNaH2PO4/Na3PO4, pH 7.2, containing 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μmleupeptin, 5 mmNa4P2O7, and 1 mmNa3VO4). The cells were scraped, and cell suspensions were placed in a 1.7-ml tube, sonicated, and then centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatants were discarded, and the pellets were treated with PE extraction buffer containing 10 mm CHAPS and sonicated. Detergent-soluble proteins were collected after centrifugation as described above. Protein concentrations were determined with the BCA protein assay (Pierce) using BSA as the protein standard. Protein samples (25 μg) were electrophoresed, blotted, and probed with anti-2C-IC or anti-2C-CT antibodies as described below. Detergent-soluble protein solutions were diluted with 4× sample buffer (250 mm Tris, pH 6.8, containing 8% SDS, 40% glycerol, 4% 2-mercaptoethanol, and bromphenol blue) and separated on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Proteins were transferred from gels to nitrocellulose membranes Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in a modified Towbin transfer buffer (25 mm Tris and 192 mm glycine, pH ≈8.6). Membranes were probed with anti-2C-IC or anti-2C-CT antibodies, and the immunoreactive bands were detected using alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Dako Corp., Carpinteria, CA) as described (21Backstrom J.R. Westphal R.S. Canton H. Sanders-Bush E. Mol. Brain Res. 1995; 33: 311-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Band intensities were quantitated on a Macintosh computer using the public domain NIH Image program developed at the United States National Institutes of Health. Cells stably expressing wild-type or mutant ΔPDZ 5-HT2C receptors were labeled with [32P]orthophosphate as described (7Westphal R.S. Backstrom J.R. Sanders-Bush E. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 48: 200-205PubMed Google Scholar), except cells were incubated with 0.2 mCi of 32P/ml for 2 h. Cells were untreated or treated with 1 μm 5-hydroxytryptamine for 15 min. Membrane fractions of cells were prepared in PE extraction buffer, and detergent-soluble proteins were extracted with 0.3 ml of PE extraction buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, and 0.1% SDS. For immunoprecipitation of receptors, 1 μg of antibody was added to detergent-soluble protein and incubated overnight at 4 °C with rocking. Ten μl of goat anti-rabbit antibody beads (generated by conjugating Fc fragment-specific antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc.) to protein G-agarose (Pierce) in 20 mm dimethyl pimelimidate to a final concentration of 4 mg of antibodies/ml of gel) was added, and incubation was continued for 4 h at 4 °C with rocking. The beads were pelleted and washed sequentially with PE extraction buffer containing the following: 0.5% Triton X-100 and 0.5 m NaCl; 0.25% Triton X-100 and 0.1m NaCl; 0.1% Triton X-100; and 0.1% SDS (one wash each). Fifteen μl of PE extraction buffer containing 1% SDS was added to the beads, and the mixture was incubated for 5 min at room temperature. Then, 15 μl of PE extraction buffer containing 5% Nonidet P-40 was added to the beads; and after mixing, 90 μl of PE extraction buffer and 2 μl (0.4 units) of recombinant N-glycosidase F (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) were added. After incubation for 2 h at 37 °C, 40 μl of 4× sample buffer was added to the suspension, and 70 μl of each fraction was electrophoresed on two 10% gels. One gel was transferred to nitrocellulose, and membranes were probed with anti-2C-IC antibodies; and the other gel was dried and exposed to a PhosphorImager cassette (Molecular Dynamics, Inc.). Cells stably expressing ΔPDZ (clone ΔPDZ-2) or wild-type 5-HT2C receptors were grown in serum-free medium in the presence of myo-[3H]inositol as described (23Barker E.L. Westphal R.S. Schmidt D. Sanders-Bush E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11687-11690Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were stimulated with increasing concentrations of serotonin in the presence of 10 mm lithium chloride and 10 μm pargyline for 30 min. [3H]Inositol monophosphates were extracted, isolated by anion-exchange chromatography, and quantitated by liquid scintillation counting. Concentration-response curves and EC50 values were calculated with GraphPAD Prism software. Calcium imaging was performed with cells in 35-mm plastic culture dishes. Cells in DMEM containing 9% fetal bovine serum were grown to 50–70% confluence. The medium was replaced with serum-free DMEM and incubated overnight. Cells were loaded with the calcium indicator fura-2/AM (2 μg/ml; Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene OR) for 1 h at room temperature in HEPES/calcium buffer. Loaded cells were continuously superfused with HEPES/calcium buffer and visualized using a Nikon inverted microscope attached to a Compix calcium imaging system. The imaging system consists of a CCD-72 camera (Dage-MTI, Inc., Michigan City, IN) attached to an IBM compatible computer executing SIMCA C-imaging software (Compix, Inc.). Intracellular calcium was visualized by fluorescence ratio measurements at wavelengths of 340 and 380 nm. The response to the initial challenge with 100 nm serotonin was monitored for 10 min. Cells were then washed with HEPES/calcium buffer for 2.5, 5, or 10 min before a second application of 100 nm serotonin. The half-lives for decay of the initial responses were calculated as the time between maximal and half-maximal responses. The second peak response of a cell was divided by the first peak response to determine the percent initial response for each cell. Responses were obtained from 20–80 cells/experiment. Results from three independent experiments (means ± S.D.) were plotted versus the time interval between agonist challenges. Fibroblasts stably expressing the wild-type 5-HT2C receptor were grown in serum-free medium containing tunicamycin to generate newly synthesized, unglycosylated 5-HT2C receptors. Cells were either untreated or treated with serotonin or with serotonin in the presence of the antagonist mianserin. Membrane proteins were solubilized with CHAPS detergent and electrophoresed on SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Immunoblots were probed with 5-HT2C receptor antibodies against a region of the third intracellular loop (anti-2C-IC) or carboxyl terminus (anti-2C-CT). Untreated cells contained an immunoreactive protein with a mass of 40 kDa (Fig. 2 A,first lane). Treatment of cells with serotonin caused formation of an additional 41-kDa immunoreactive protein (Fig.2 A, second lane). The serotonin-mediated shift in mass from 40 to 41 kDa was blocked by preincubation with the antagonist mianserin (Fig. 2 A, third lane). The amount of 41-kDa protein was dependent on serotonin concentration (Fig.2 B) and was maximal after treatment with 100 nmserotonin. Experiments were also performed on glycosylated receptors that were treated with N-glycosidase F to removeN-linked sugars before electrophoresis. Although this approach also demonstrated an agonist-mediated increase in receptor mass, treatment of cells with tunicamycin produced better resolution between the 40- and 41-kDa bands than did treatment of cell extracts with N-glycosidase F. The possibility that the 41-kDa immunoreactive protein was a phosphorylated form of 40-kDa receptors was examined. Alkaline phosphatase or buffer was added to CHAPS-soluble extracts prepared from cells pretreated with serotonin (Fig.2 C). Increasing concentrations of alkaline phosphatase progressively decreased the mass of the 41-kDa protein to 40 kDa. Additional experiments were performed to determine the time course of serotonin-mediated receptor phosphorylation and dephosphorylation. To examine phosphorylation, cells were treated with serotonin for increasing times before extracting CHAPS-soluble protein. Formation of the phosphorylated 41-kDa protein was complete by 10 min of agonist treatment, the earliest time point examined (Fig.3 A, second lane). Treatment with agonist for 1 h (Fig. 3 A, third lane) did not change the amount of 41-kDa protein. To examine dephosphorylation, cells were treated with serotonin for 15 min and washed four times. After the washes, cells were incubated for increasing times in the absence of serotonin before extraction of CHAPS-soluble protein. The amount of 41-kDa protein decreased with a half-life of 10 ± 1 min (n = 3), whereas the amount of 40-kDa protein increased (Fig. 3 B). These results are consistent with the reversible actions of protein phosphorylation and dephosphorylation and establish that the 41-kDa protein is a phosphorylated form of unglycosylated 5-HT2C receptors.Figure 3Time course of 5-HT2C receptor phosphorylation and dephosphorylation. A, the level of 5-HT2C receptor phosphorylation after treatment of cells with 100 nm serotonin for 10 min (second lane) was similar to that after 1 h (third lane). Data are representative of three independent experiments. B, cells treated with 100 nm serotonin for 15 min were washed four times with serum-free medium and incubated for the indicated times. After agonist washout, the half-life of 5-HT2C receptor phosphorylation was 10 ± 1 min (n = 3). The masses of immunoreactive proteins are indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To determine which region of the 5-HT2C receptor was phosphorylated, tryptic digests from intact cells were evaluated in the band-shift phosphorylation assay using anti-peptide antibodies against the third intracellular loop (anti-2C-IC) and the carboxyl terminus (anti-2C-CT). The results were consistent with phosphorylation within the carboxyl terminus (data not shown). Thus, two mutant 5-HT2C receptor constructs were created that lack either two (ΔPDZ) or all (Δ375/CT) potential phosphorylation sites in the carboxyl terminus (Fig. 1). The Δ375/CT receptor was created by deletion of all 86 amino acids and replacement with a region of the 2C-CT epitope and the conserved cysteine 13 residues from the seventh transmembrane domain. To determine whether the cellular distribution of truncation mutants differs from that of wild-type 5-HT2Creceptors, fibroblasts were transiently transfected with receptor cDNA, and immunoreactive receptors were detected with anti-2C-IC antibodies. Receptors that lack the terminal PDZ recognition motif (Ser458-Ser-Val-COOH; ΔPDZ) were distributed throughout transiently transfected cells (Fig.4 B) in a pattern similar to that of wild-type receptors (Fig. 4 A). In contrast, receptors that lack 72 residues of the 86-amino acid tail (Δ375/CT) were localized primarily in punctate structures surrounding the nucleus (Fig. 4 C). Identical results were observed when receptors were labeled with anti-2C-CT antibodies (data not shown). Since the intracellular distribution of Δ375/CT receptors would make it difficult to interpret results from phosphorylation assays, only ΔPDZ receptor cell lines were evaluated further. Fibroblasts stably expressing ΔPDZ or wild-type 5-HT2C receptors were untreated or treated with 1 μm serotonin and examined in two phosphorylation assays. Phosphorylation was not detected in the band-shift assay using two independent ΔPDZ clones (ΔPDZ-2 and ΔPDZ-19) (Fig.5 A, lanes 1 and 2), whereas wild-type receptors were phosphorylated as determined by the increase in mass to 41 kDa (lane 3). To confirm the lack of phosphorylation of the ΔPDZ receptor, 32P incorporation studies were performed with glycosylated receptors in the absence of tunicamycin. Cells labeled with 32P were treated with 1 μmserotonin or vehicle (water), and receptors were immunoprecipitated with anti-2C-IC antibodies. The immunoprecipitates were treated with N-glycosidase F, electrophoresed, and either exposed to a PhosphorImager cassette to determine incorporation of 32P (Fig. 5 B) or blotted onto nitrocellulose and probed with anti-2C-IC antibodies to determine the total amount of receptors (data not shown). Consistent with the results from the band-shift assay, incorporation of 32P was not detected in ΔPDZ receptors from either cell line (Fig. 5 B, lanes 1 and 2), whereas the wild-type receptor was phosphorylated (lane 3). To test the hypothesis that phosphorylation of the 5-HT2C receptor promotes desensitization, a phosphoinositide hydrolysis assay was performed with cell lines expressing either ΔPDZ receptors (ΔPDZ-2) or wild-type 5-HT2C receptors (Fig. 6). Both receptors demonstrated an ∼4-fold increase in basal inositol monophosphate accumulation with identical EC50 values (ΔPDZ, 4.7 ± 1.1 nm; and wild-type, 4.7 ± 1.2 nm; n = six experiments). Thus, deletion of the PDZ recognition motif did not alter the EC50 or maximal response during a single 30-min application of serotonin relative to the wild-type 5-HT2C receptor. To determine whether treatment of cells with serotonin promotes desensitization of a subsequent response, we utilized a protocol that was previously demonstrated to promote desensitization of wild-type 5-HT2Creceptor responses (7Westphal R.S. Backstrom J.R. Sanders-Bush E. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 48: 200-205PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were either untreated or treated with 100 nm serotonin, a concentration that causes maximal receptor phosphorylation (Fig. 2), for 16 h. After washing four times with serum-free DMEM, phosphoinositide hydrolysis was determined with increasing concentrations of serotonin (10−10to 10−5m) to generate concentration-response curves. Table Iillustrates that pretreatment of cells with serotonin caused a 3-fold increase in the EC50 of wild-type receptors and an 8-fold increase in the EC50 of ΔPDZ receptors. In these experiments, cells were treated with serotonin for 16 h; however, maximal 5-HT2C receptor phosphorylation occurs within 10 min of serotonin treatment (Fig. 3). Therefore, calcium imaging was utilized to examine dynamic 5-HT2C receptor responses in a more relevant time frame.Table IAgonist pretreatment increases the EC50 of serotonin for ΔPDZ and wild-type 5-HT2C receptors5-HT2CreceptorEC50pvalue1-aComparison between values obtained without and with serotonin.pvalue1-bComparison between wild-type and ΔPDZ, values obtained with serotonin.−Serotonin+SerotoninnmWild-type4.9 ± 1.414 ± 4.60.0091ΔPDZ4.8 ± 1.541 ± 130.00150.0078Cells stably expressing ΔPDZ (ΔPDZ-2) or wild-type 5-HT2Creceptors were labeled overnight with myo-[3H]inositol in the absence (−) or presence (+) of 100 nm serotonin for 16 h.

Calcium imaging was performed with cells expressing ΔPDZ (ΔPDZ-2) or wild-type 5-HT2Creceptors to examine the dynamics of receptor desensitization. Cells were treated with 100 nm serotonin for 10 min, washed for 2.5 min, and restimulated with 100 nm serotonin. Wild-type 5-HT2C receptors (Fig.7 A) and ΔPDZ receptors (Fig.7 B) demonstrated a robust, transient release of intracellular calcium. Furthermore, wild-type and ΔPDZ receptors displayed similar maximal responses (Fig. 7) and indistinguishable half-lives for decay of the initial responses (wild-type, 62.4 ± 7.9 s; and ΔPDZ, 75.2 ± 9.5 s; n = 10; p = 0.31 by unpaired Student's t test). After washing for 2.5 min, a second application of serotonin to cells expressing wild-type receptors promoted calcium release at 37 ± 9% of the initial response (Figs. 7 A and 8). In contrast, a second application of serotonin to cells expressing ΔPDZ receptors produced responses that were only 13 ± 9% of the initial signal (Figs. 7 B and 8). To further investigate this observation, longer washout periods were examined. Fig.8 illustrates that after washing for 5 min, secondary responses of wild-type and ΔPDZ receptors were 50 ± 21 and 7 ± 10% of the initial response, respectively. After washing for 10 min, secondary responses of wild-type and ΔPDZ receptors were indistinguishable.Figure 8ΔPDZ receptors display delayed recovery of calcium responses relative to wild-type 5-HT2Creceptors. Cells stably expressing either wild-type or ΔPDZ 5-HT2C receptors were incubated in serum-free medium overnight and then loaded with fura-2 for 1 h. Cells were challenged twice with 100 nm serotonin (see Fig. 7) at the interval indicated on the x axis. A ratio (shown on the y axis) was generated by dividing the peak height of the second calcium response (peak 2) by the first response (peak 1).

Both S458A and S459A receptors decreased serotonin-mediated phosphorylation to 50% of wild-type receptor levels (Fig. 9 B, white bars). Identical results were obtained with 100 nm serotonin (data not shown). For the calcium release assay, cells were treated with 100 nm serotonin for 10 min, washed for 5 min, and restimulated with 100 nm serotonin. Whereas the peak secondary responses of S458A receptors were similar to those of wild-type receptors, those of S459A receptors were diminished (Fig. 9 B, gray bars). Thus, mutation of Ser459 decreased receptor phosphorylation and diminished subsequent calcium responses relative to wild-type 5-HT2C receptors. Treatment of cells expressing serotonin 5-HT2Creceptors with serotonin promotes phosphoinositide hydrolysis (24Conn P.J. Sanders-Bush E. Hoffman B.J. Hartig P.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cell Calcium. 1995; 17: 120-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), it is not known whether phosphorylation of the 5-HT2C receptor plays a role in desensitization. Therefore, we created 5-HT2C receptor phosphorylation-deficient mutants and examined serotonin responses in phosphoinositide hydrolysis and calcium release experiments. Here, we demonstrate that deletion of the terminal three amino acids, which include a PDZ recognition motif (Ser458-Ser-Val-COOH; ΔPDZ), abrogates serotonin-mediated phosphorylation and, unexpectedly, delays the recovery (resensitization) of desensitized 5-HT2C receptor responses. Immunoreactive 5-HT2C receptors have masses of 51–68 kDa; and after treatment of cells with tunicamycin to preventN-linked glycosylation, receptors are detected with masses of 40 and 41 kDa (21Backstrom J.R. Westphal R.S. Canton H. Sanders-Bush E. Mol. Brain Res. 1995; 33: 311-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Since two bands are detected from cells maintained in medium containing serum (21Backstrom J.R. Westphal R.S. Canton H. Sanders-Bush E. Mol. Brain Res. 1995; 33: 311-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), we examined the possibility that serotonin, present in serum, alters the migration of receptors. Here, we demonstrate that the 41-kDa protein is a phosphorylated form of 40-kDa 5-HT2C receptors. Cells in serum-free medium contain 5-HT2C receptors with a mass of 40 kDa, whereas treatment of cells with the agonist serotonin causes the appearance of the 41-kDa protein. This agonist effect is blocked by co-incubation with mianserin, a 5-HT2A/2C receptor antagonist, and reversed by either agonist washout or treatment of cell extracts with alkaline phosphatase. These results establish that the 41-kDa protein reflects phosphorylated 5-HT2C receptors. We exploited the band-shift phosphorylation assay to identify a domain of 5-HT2C receptor that is required for receptor phosphorylation. Two truncated 5-HT2C receptors were generated that lack either all potential phosphorylation sites in the carboxyl terminus (Δ375/CT) or the terminal two serine residues (ΔPDZ). The mutant Δ375/CT receptor was created by truncation after the seventh transmembrane domain to remove all 86 amino acids of the carboxyl terminus and replacement with a region of the 2C-CT epitope that lacks serine, threonine, and tyrosine residues. The cysteine located 13 residues from the predicted membrane domain was conserved in this construct because this residue has been shown to be important for the function of 5-HT2A receptors (26Buck F. Meyerhof W. Werr H. Richter D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 178: 1421-1428Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The mutant ΔPDZ receptor lacks only three amino acids (Ser458-Ser-Val-COOH). Mutant 5-HT2C receptor cDNA was transiently expressed in fibroblasts, and the distribution of immunoreactive receptors was compared with that of wild-type 5-HT2C receptors. Two different phenotypes were observed: Δ375/CT receptors were predominantly intracellular, whereas ΔPDZ and wild-type 5-HT2C receptors were distributed in a similar pattern throughout cells. Cell lines expressing ΔPDZ receptors were therefore a valid system for evaluating the contribution of the PDZ recognition motif in phosphorylation assays. The band-shift phosphorylation assay and incorporation of32P were used to examine phosphorylation of two independent cell lines expressing ΔPDZ 5-HT2C receptors. In the absence of serotonin, wild-type and ΔPDZ receptors had an apparent mass of 40 kDa. Treatment of cells with serotonin caused the appearance of the phosphorylated 41-kDa form in wild-type receptors, whereas no increase in mass was detected in ΔPDZ receptors. In support of the results obtained with the band-shift assay, serotonin-mediated incorporation of 32P was not detected in ΔPDZ receptors, whereas wild-type receptors demonstrated robust phosphorylation. These results further confirm that the band-shift phosphorylation assay reflects 5-HT2C receptor phosphorylation and establish that the PDZ recognition motif is required for receptor phosphorylation. Previously, we demonstrated that overnight pretreatment of cells stably expressing wild-type 5-HT2C receptors with serotonin increases the EC50 value for stimulating phosphoinositide hydrolysis without changing the maximal response to serotonin (7Westphal R.S. Backstrom J.R. Sanders-Bush E. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 48: 200-205PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether receptor phosphorylation is involved in the observed desensitization, cells stably expressing ΔPDZ or wild-type 5-HT2C receptors were either untreated or treated with 100 nm serotonin overnight, washed, and then stimulated with increasing concentrations of serotonin. Interestingly, pretreatment with serotonin promoted a significantly greater increase in the EC50 value of serotonin for ΔPDZ receptors (8-fold) than for wild-type 5-HT2C receptors (3-fold). This result is not consistent with the hypothesis that 5-HT2C receptor phosphorylation promotes desensitization and raises the intriguing possibility that phosphorylation may actually attenuate desensitization or promote resensitization of 5-HT2C receptor responses. The time of pretreatment with serotonin was much longer in the functional assays (hours) than in the phosphorylation assays (minutes), and it is possible that additional 5-HT2C receptor sites were phosphorylated during prolonged serotonin treatment. Therefore, calcium imaging was used to examine the dynamics of 5-HT2Creceptor desensitization and resensitization within a time frame that corresponds to receptor phosphorylation. Both ΔPDZ and wild-type 5-HT2C receptors displayed robust, transient increases in intracellular calcium with similar maximal responses. In the continued presence of serotonin, responses of wild-type and ΔPDZ receptors decayed with indistinguishable half-lives of ∼1 min. These results lend additional support, within a relevant time frame, that desensitization of 5-HT2C receptor responses occurs in the absence of receptor phosphorylation. After washing cells with agonist-free medium, dramatically different recovery responses were observed. After 5 min, wild-type 5-HT2C receptor responses recovered to 50% of the initial response, whereas ΔPDZ receptor responses recovered to only 7% of the initial response. After 10 min, which corresponds to the half-life for reversal of wild-type 5-HT2C receptor phosphorylation, significant differences between ΔPDZ and wild-type 5-HT2C receptors were not observed. Thus, the results from phosphoinositide hydrolysis and calcium release experiments suggest that phosphorylation of the 5-HT2C receptor enhances resensitization of 5-HT2C receptor responses rather than altering desensitization kinetics. Since ΔPDZ 5-HT2C receptors lack two potential phosphorylation sites, single point mutants were created at Ser458, the PDZ recognition motif serine, or Ser459 to determine if mutation of either residue alters receptor phosphorylation and/or calcium responses. Cell lines expressing identical densities of S458A or S459A 5-HT2Creceptors were first examined in the band-shift phosphorylation assay. Both S458A and S459A receptors decreased serotonin-mediated phosphorylation to 50% of wild-type 5-HT2C receptor levels, suggesting that both Ser458 and Ser459are phosphorylated. Next, calcium release responses were examined. Interestingly, responses of S459A receptors to a second application of serotonin were diminished relative to wild-type 5-HT2Creceptors, whereas responses of S458A receptors reproduced the wild-type phenotype. These results are consistent with a major role of Ser459 rather than the PDZ recognition motif per se in resensitization of 5-HT2C receptor responses. In contrast, the PDZ recognition motif of β2-adrenergic receptors (Ser-Leu-Leu-COOH) is involved in efficient recycling of internalized receptors to the cell surface, and mutations within this motif enhance agonist-mediated receptor degradation (27Cao T.T. Deacon H.W. Reczek D. Bretscher A. von Zastrow M. Nature. 1999; 401: 286-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar). Our observations are consistent with a role of Ser459 in resensitization of 5-HT2C receptor responses and suggest that phosphorylation at this site regulates resensitization.

Intact cell decay analysis of tetracycline-suppressible luciferase chimera mRNAs shows that regulated stabilization of the intrinsically unstable mRNA contributes to this response. Deletion mapping of the 2468-base COX-2 mRNA 3′-untranslated region (UTR) shows that a distal, 130-base AU-rich region functions as a cis-acting regulated stabilization response element, which under basal conditions serves as the dominant instability determinant for the 3′-UTR. Regulation of this response is through the p42/44 MAP kinases, whereas the p38 MAP kinases are not involved. The stabilization response element binds avidly and specifically to a prominent nuclear-enriched ∼90-kDa factor and several less abundantly labeled mRNA binding proteins that are unaffected by P2Y receptor signaling. Although other instability determinants are located throughout the rat COX-2 mRNA 3′-UTR, mitogen signaling only interferes with rapid decay mediated by its most distal 130 bases. A complex of nuclear factors that bind this mRNA region specifically may include candidate targets for regulatory modulation. These observations support the general notion that the rapid induction of immediate-early gene expression through mitogenic receptors involves simultaneous activation of transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms."

In Drosophila, rhodopsin (Rh1), the most abundant rhodopsin, is glycosylated in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and requires its molecular chaperone, NinaA, for exit from the ER and transport through the secretory pathway. Studies of vertebrate rhodopsins have generated several conflicting proposals regarding the role of glycosylation in rhodopsin maturation. We investigated the role of Rh1 glycosylation and Rh1/NinaA interactions under in vivo conditions by analyzing transgenic flies expressing Rh1 with isoleucine substitutions at each of the two consensus sites forN-linked glycosylation (N20I and N196I). We show that Asn20 is the sole site for glycosylation. The Rh1N20I protein is retained within the secretory pathway, causing an accumulation of ER cisternae and dilation of the Golgi complex. NinaA associates with nonglycosylated Rh1N20I; therefore, retention of nonglycosylated rhodopsin within the ER is not due to the lack of Rh1N20I/NinaA interaction. We further show that Rh1N20I interferes with wild type Rh1 maturation and triggers a dominant form of retinal degeneration. We conclude that during maturation Rh1 is present in protein complexes containing NinaA and that Rh1 glycosylation is required for transport of the complexes through the secretory pathway.

Oligosaccharide processing and trimming are initiated in the ER prior to delivery to the Golgi apparatus, where further trimming and sequential addition of saccharides results in the protein becoming terminally glycosylated (3Kornfeld R.

Disease-causing point mutations in rhodopsin, T4K, N15S, and T17M, have been identified in patients with adRP, indicating that glycosylation defects act dominantly to cause retinal degeneration in humans (16Daiger S.P.

In Drosophila,the elimination of N-linked glycosylation of Rh1 leads to photoreceptor cell defects, indicating that rhodopsin glycosylation is critical for fly visual function (21O'Tousa J.E.

Studies using site-specific mutagenesis of consensus glycosylation sites in rhodopsin and expression in cell culture support a role for glycosylation in folding and maturation (24Sung C.H.

Another study indicates that transport defects can be overcome with vitamin A supplementation (11-cisretinal) (26Li T. Sandberg M.A. Pawlyk B.S. Rosner B. Hayes K.C. Dryja T.P. Berson E.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11933-11938Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), indicating that the maturation defect may not be a direct consequence of lack of glycosylation. Tunicamycin, which blocks the formation of precursor oligosaccharides required forN-linked glycosylation, has also been used to study the role of glycosylation in rhodopsin biosynthesis (25Kaushal S.

In Rana pipiens, tunicamycin treatment causes nonglycosylated opsin to accumulate in the ER (27Fliesler S.J. Basinger S.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 1116-1120Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In another frog, Xenopus laevis,the lack of opsin glycosylation disrupts normal outer segment disc assembly but has no effect on intracellular transport of rhodopsin (28Fliesler S.J. Rayborn M.E. Hollyfield J.G. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 100: 574-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). In addition, tunicamycin does not prevent rhodopsin transport in cell culture, indicating that glycosylation is not required for rhodopsin maturation (25Kaushal S. Ridge K.D. Khorana H.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4024-4028Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Further conflicting data stem from the analysis of the photoreceptor cells in a deceased 68-year-old patient with adRP, carrying the same point mutation that caused defects in rhodopsin maturation in cell culture. The photoreceptor cells do not display pathology indicative of rhodopsin transport defects (19Li Z.Y. Jacobson S.G. Milam A.H. Exp. Eye Res. 1994; 58: 397-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Although glycosylation is required for the folding and maturation of certain proteins, its role in rhodopsin folding and maturation requires further evaluation. In general, N-linked oligosaccharides facilitate interactions with enzymes and chaperones in the ER to promote protein maturation. For example, chaperones such as calnexin and calreticulin bind N-linked oligosaccharides of proteins, as part of a pathway ensuring correct folding in the ER, and selective transport of properly folded proteins from the ER (1Helenius A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 253-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar, 2Helenius A. Trombetta E.S. Hebert D.N. Simons J.F.

InDrosophila photoreceptor cells, NinaA, a type I membrane protein, is required as a molecular chaperone for Rh1 exit from the ER and transport through the secretory pathway (10Colley N.J. Baker E.K. Stamnes M.A. Zuker C.S. Cell. 1991; 67: 255-263Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar, 31Baker E.K. Colley N.J. Zuker C.S. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4886-4895Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). NinaA is located predominantly within the ER but also colocalizes with Rh1 within vesicles located in distal compartments of the secretory pathway. NinaA forms a specific, stable complex with Rh1, and genetic dosage studies demonstrate a quantitative requirement for NinaA in Rh1 transport. These findings are consistent with NinaA functioning as a molecular chaperone for Rh1 rather than a folding catalyst (32Hartl F.U. Nature. 1996; 381: 571-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (3130) Google Scholar). Drosophila is an excellent model organism for analyzing thein vivo role of glycosylation in chaperone-mediated rhodopsin maturation. Mutant forms of Rh1 may be introduced into flies, and their function may be studied in their native photoreceptor cells, eliminating potential artifacts present in heterologous cell culture systems. We undertook the current study to investigate the role of rhodopsin glycosylation in Drosophila. Rh1 has two consensus sites for N-linked glycosylation at Asn20 and Asn196. Using site-directed mutagenesis, we made isoleucine substitutions at each of these two sites and expressed the mutant Rh1N20I and Rh1N196I forms inDrosophila. The transgenic animals expressing Rh1N20I and Rh1N196I were analyzed for rhodopsin maturation, interaction with NinaA, and retinal degeneration. The wild type strain used in these studies is Drosophila melanogaster w1118 . ninaAP269 (33Stephenson R.S. O' Tousa J. Scavarda N.J. Randall L.L. Pak W.L. Cosens D. Vince-Price D.

One-day-old adult fly heads were fixed on ice in 3% paraformaldehyde in 100 mm sodium phosphate buffer containing 2 mm calcium chloride and protease inhibitors (pH 7.2–7.4). The tissue was infiltrated with 2.3m sucrose and frozen in liquid nitrogen for cryoultramicrotomy (38Tokuyasu K.T. Histochem.

The fixed tissue was dehydrated in serial changes of ethanol followed by propylene oxide and embedded in Spurr's medium (Polysciences, Inc.). Ultrathin sections were obtained on a Reichert Ultracut E ultramicrotome, stained with 2% uranyl acetate and lead citrate, and viewed at 80kV on a Phillips 410 electron microscope. For all genotypes described, at least five individual heads were sectioned, and 100 ommatidia were observed from each eye. Electroretinograms (ERGs) were carried out on 3–5-day-old flies according to published procedures (43Larrivee D.C. Conrad S.K. Stephenson R.S. Pak W.L. J. Gen.

The immunoreactive proteins were visualized using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch) followed by ECL detection (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech).

Flies, 3 days old or younger, were subjected to affinity chromatography essentially as described previously (31Baker E.K. Colley N.J. Zuker C.S.

Membranes were prepared by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 60 min. The membrane pellet was resuspended in sodium phosphate buffer with protease inhibitors containing 1%n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside, homogenized, and centrifuged at 150,000 × g for 60 min to remove insoluble material. The supernatant was loaded onto columns of CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) conjugated to 4C5 mouse monoclonal antibody directed to Rh1. After exhaustive rinsing, Rh1 and its associated proteins were eluted with 5 ml of triethylamine (pH 11.2). The samples were dialyzed, concentrated, and suspended in sample buffer (45Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207529) Google Scholar) before being subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting. All procedures were carried out on ice or at 4 °C. The eluted sample was divided such that 80% of the sample was used for detection of NinaA using a rabbit polyclonal antibody (gift of A. Becker and C. S. Zuker), and 10% of sample was used for detection of Rh1 using the 4C5 mouse monoclonal antibody. Drosophila photoreceptor cells contain specialized regions of the plasma membrane, made up of numerous tightly packed microvilli, called rhabdomeres, that contain the rhodopsin photopigments and the other constituents of the phototransduction cascade (Fig. 1 A). InDrosophila photoreceptor cells, Rh1 is core glycosylated in the ER, transported through the Golgi complex, and delivered to the rhabdomeres of the R1–6 photoreceptor cells where it functions in phototransduction (10Colley N.J. Baker E.K. Stamnes M.A. Zuker C.S. Cell. 1991; 67: 255-263Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar, 48Montell C. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 231-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Rh1 is a G protein-coupled receptor that has two potential sites for N-linked glycosylation, Asn20 and Asn196 (Fig. 1 B) (11O'Tousa J.E. Baehr W. Martin R.L. Hirsh J. Pak W.L. Applebury M.L. Cell. 1985; 40: 839-850Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar, 12Zuker C.S. Cowman A.F. Rubin G.M. Cell. 1985; 40: 851-858Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar,49Britt S.G. Feiler R. Kirschfeld K. Zuker C.S. Neuron. 1993; 11: 29-39Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). We used site-directed mutagenesis to obtain single nucleotide alterations in the coding capacity from an asparagine to an isoleucine at positions 20 and 196 (see boxes in Fig. 1 B). We then constructed transgenic flies expressing these mutant forms, Rh1N20I and Rh1N196I, to examine the in vivo role of glycosylation in Rh1 transport through the secretory pathway. In wild type flies, Rh1 localizes predominantly to the rhabdomeres of the R1–6 photoreceptor cells (Fig. 1 C). In contrast, the photoreceptor cells expressing Rh1N20I (Fig. 1 D) and Rh1N196I (Fig. 1 E) display an altered distribution of Rh1. In both cases, substantial amounts of Rh1N20I and Rh1N196I mutant proteins are distributed in a perinuclear fashion, presumably reflecting their accumulation within the endoplasmic reticulum. Consistent with this interpretation, ultrastructural analysis of the mutant photoreceptors revealed large accumulations of ER and Golgi membranes (Fig.2, B and C). In wild type photoreceptor cells, the cytoplasm displays limited amounts of ER and Golgi cisternae (Fig. 2 A). The Golgi membranes were particularly prominent in the Rh1N20I mutant (Fig.2 B), suggesting that some protein may be escaping the retention system of the ER. Although the ER is the primary site for quality control, the Golgi complex also participates (30Ellgaard L. Molinari M. Helenius A. Science. 1999; 286: 1882-1888Crossref PubMed Scopus (1066) Google Scholar). The quality control retention mechanisms are not 100% effective, because some of the Rh1N20I and Rh1N196I mutant rhodopsins avoid the retention system and are successfully transported to the rhabdomeres (Fig. 1, D and E). To investigate whether these rhodopsins are functional, we measured ERGs from 3–5-day-old flies. Fig.3 A shows an ERG trace of a wild type fly subjected to bright orange and blue light stimuli. Upon blue light stimulation, the trace fails to return to base line until application of an orange stimulus. This condition, known as the prolonged depolarizing afterpotential (PDA), is indicative of normal rhodopsin levels (44Stephenson R.S. O'Tousa J. Scavarda N.J. Randall L.L. Pak W.L. Symp. Soc. Exp. Biol. 1983; 36: 477-501PubMed Google Scholar). An ERG trace of Rh1N20I is shown in Fig. 3 B. The reduced amplitude of the light response and the lack of the PDA demonstrate that the mutant flies express low levels of Rh1N20I protein. However, the small amount of Rh1N20I protein that is transported to the rhabdomeres is functional (21O'Tousa J.E. Visual Neurosci. 1992; 8: 385-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 22Brown G. Chen D.M. Christianson J.S. Lee R. Stark W.S. Visual Neurosci. 1994; 11: 619-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Rh1N196I flies display an ERG response, demonstrating that Rh1N196I is also functional (Fig. 3 C). The larger amplitude of the ERG response suggests that more Rh1N196I is successfully transported to the rhabdomeres compared with Rh1N20I. However, the absence of the PDA in Rh1N196I mutants reflects a reduction in functional Rh1N196I protein relative to wild type. The glycosylation state allows us to distinguish between rhabdomeric and ER forms of Rh1 (10Colley N.J. Baker E.K. Stamnes M.A. Zuker C.S. Cell. 1991; 67: 255-263Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar, 34Colley N.J. Cassill J.A. Baker E.K. Zuker C.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3070-3074Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Wild type Rh1 is detected as the mature rhabdomeric (34-kDa) form (Fig.4 A, lane 1). In ninaA269 mutants, Rh1 does not exit the ER (10Colley N.J. Baker E.K. Stamnes M.A. Zuker C.S. Cell. 1991; 67: 255-263Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar) and accumulates as a high molecular mass glycosylated ER form (Fig. 4 A, lane 2). Treatment ofninaA269 extracts with endo H increases the electrophoretic mobility of the Rh1 opsin such that it now migrates with the mature form (Fig. 4 B, lanes 3 and4). Because endo H selectively cleaves immature high mannosyl oligosaccharide chains (3Kornfeld R. Kornfeld S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 631-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (3779) Google Scholar), this form of Rh1 must represent the glycosylated ER form. Rh1N20I is detected as a 34-kDa form, and its expression is severely reduced relative to wild type (Fig. 4 A, lane 3). These results are consistent with the smaller amplitude in the light response by ERG analysis (Fig.3 B) and the reduction in the size of the rhabdomeres (Fig.2 B). We have shown above that Rh1N20I displays defective transport (Fig. 1 D), indicating that if Rh1N20Iwas glycosylated, it should be present in the high molecular mass immature ER form. However, because the 34-kDa band may represent the mature form, already subjected to the normal process of carbohydrate removal, we examined the potential for the ER form of Rh1N20I to be glycosylated. We expressed Rh1N20I in ninaA269 mutants. The Rh1N20I isolated from ninaA269mutants is still detected as a 34-kDa band (Fig. 4 A,lane 4). Endo H digestion does not alter the mobility of the Rh1N20I expressed in ninaA269mutants (Fig. 4 B, lanes 5 and 6), demonstrating that unlike wild type Rh1, the immature, ER form of Rh1N20I is not glycosylated. The Rh1N20I mutant protein is not glycosylated at the Asn196 site. Analysis of the electrophoretic mobility of Rh1N196Ireveals that it is detected in a 40-kDa endo H-sensitive form (Fig. 4, A, lanes 5 and 6, andB, lanes 7 and 8). This form of Rh1N196I must represent the normal glycosylated ER form. Although a ninaA269 mutant genetic background is necessary to maintain wild type rhodopsin in the high molecular mass ER form, this ER form was also detected in Rh1N196I mutants (Fig. 4 A, lanes 5and 6). These data show that despite the capability for proper glycosylation, Rh1N196I is not efficiently transported properly through the secretory pathway. These data are consistent with the localization of Rh1N196I to the ER (Fig. 1 E) and the accumulation of ER cisternae in the Rh1N196I mutants (Fig. 2 C). The 40-kDa molecular mass for Rh1N196I indicates that there is no oligosaccharide chain loss. If Asn196 can be glycosylated, we would predict that elimination of the Asn196 site would reduce the number of glycan chains and hence lower the molecular mass of the immature form. This is not observed. Thus, the data are only consistent with a model in which Asn20 is the sole site forin vivo glycosylation. Prior work established that several mutations in Rh1 act dominantly to cause retinal degeneration and that the retinal degeneration results from the interference in the maturation of the wild type Rh1 by the mutant proteins (34Colley N.J.

To examine whether defects in glycosylation and transport of Rh1N20I interfere with the transport of wild type Rh1, we examined the localization of wild type Rh1 in the presence of the Rh1N20I mutants.

Consistent with this role, GRP94 expression is up-regulated by stress conditions that promote protein misfolding or unfolding, such as glucose starvation and heat shock (7Kim K.S. Lee A.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1986; 140: 881-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 8Lee A.S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1992; 4: 267-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar, 9Little E.

In addition to its role in the regulation of protein folding in the endoplasmic reticulum, GRP94 can function in the intercellular trafficking of peptides from the extracellular space to the major histocompatability complex class I antigen processing pathway of professional antigen presenting cells (10Srivastava P.K.

The observation that GRP94 can function as a peptide-binding protein derives from the pioneering studies of Srivastava and colleagues (14Srivastava P.K. DeLeo A.B. Old L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

Subsequent studies have demonstrated that GRP94-peptide complexes can elicit major histocompatability complex class I restricted immune responses against a wide variety of peptide epitopes (11Arnold D.

Thus, in addition to a homeostatic role in protein folding and assembly, GRP94 appears to function, in an as yet undefined manner, as a component of the major histocompatability complex class I antigen processing and presentation pathways of mammalian cells. The mechanism and regulation of GRP94 interactions with peptide and polypeptide substrates remains unknown. Experiments conducted with purified GRP94 and synthetic peptides have demonstrated that GRP94 binds peptides in vitro and that this peptide binding activity is markedly stimulated by heat shock (15Suto R.

The conformational and regulatory consequences of heat shock on GRP94 activity have, however, only begun to be studied. It is clear from recent data that the stimulation of peptide binding that accompanies heat shock occurs in the context of a tertiary conformational change and is accompanied by exposure of a hydrophobic domain(s) accessible to the environment sensitive fluorophore Nile Red (21Wearsch P.A.

Perhaps indicative of the complexity of Hsp90-adenosine nucleotide interactions, the recombinant N-terminal adenosine nucleotide-binding domain displays enzymatic activities that differ substantially from the native protein (24Prodromou C.

With respect to GRP94, evidence in support of intrinsic ATP binding and ATPase activities is controversial and a consensus regarding the molecular basis of an adenosine nucleotide-mediated regulation of GRP94-substrate interactions has yet to emerge (20Wearsch P.A.

To further investigate the structural basis for the activation of GRP94 peptide binding activity that accompanies heat shock, we examined the interaction of GRP94 with the environment-sensitive fluorophores, Prodan, 8-ANS, and bis-ANS. Because of its unique characteristics, we focused attention on bis-ANS. Bis-ANS has been used as a probe of the conformational state of a wide range of proteins including the molecular chaperones GroEL and DnaK (33Seale J.W. Gorovits B.M. Ybarra J. Horowitz P.M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 4079-4083Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 34Shi L. Palleros D.R. Fink A.L. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7536-7546Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). bis-ANS is known to bind to hydrophobic sites on proteins and, unlike Prodan and 8-ANS, bis-ANS also interacts with nucleotide-binding sites (35Rosen C.G. Weber G. Biochemistry. 1969; 8: 3915-3920Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 36Takashi R. Tonomura Y. Morales M.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In this study we report that bis-ANS elicits a conformational change in GRP94 that is accompanied by a substantial increase in chaperone and peptide binding activity. The activation of GRP94 function by bis-ANS is blocked by radicicol, an established ligand for the conserved, N-terminal nucleotide binding pocket of the eukaryotic Hsp90s (38Sharma S.V. Agatsuma T. Nakano H. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 2639-2645Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 39Schulte T.W. Akinaga S. Murakata T. Agatsuma T. Sugimoto S. Nakano H. Lee Y.S. Simen B.B. Argon Y. Felts S. Toft D.O. Neckers L.M. Sharma S.V. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 1435-1448Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). On the basis of these data, we propose a model in which ligand binding to the N-terminal nucleotide-binding domain of GRP94 elicits a conformational change that converts GRP94 from an inactive to an active conformation, wherein the chaperone and peptide binding activities of GRP94 are markedly stimulated. Fluorescent probes were obtained from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). bis-ANS concentration was determined by absorbance at 385 nm (ε385 = 16, 790 cm−1m−1 in water). Citrate synthase (EC 4.1.3.7) was purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals (Mannheim, Germany). Radicicol was obtained from Dr. Len Neckers, National Cancer Institute, Frederick, MD. Peptide VSV8 (RGYVYQGL) was synthesized by the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Peptide Synthesis Facility (Chapel Hill, NC). Na[125I] was purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. All other reagents were obtained from Sigma unless otherwise indicated. GRP94 was purified from porcine pancreas as described previously (40Wearsch P.A. Nicchitta C.V. Protein Expr. Purif. 1996; 7: 114-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The concentration of GRP94 was determined by absorbance at 280 nm (1A280 = 1.18 mg/ml). All binding reactions, with the exception of the indicated circular dichroism and citrate synthase aggregation experiments, were conducted in buffer A (110 mmKOAc, 20 mm NaCl, 2 mm Mg(OAc)2, 25 mm K-HEPES, pH 7.2, 100 μmCaCl2). Fluorescent probe and radicicol stocks were prepared in dimethyl formamide at 5 mm final concentration. For all assays, control reactions at solvent dilutions identical to experimental conditions were performed to correct for any solvent effects. Where indicated, GRP94 was heat shocked by incubation in a 50 °C water bath for 15 min followed by cooling to 37 °C. Emission spectra were obtained in a FluorMax spectrofluorometer (SPEX Industries Inc., Edison, NJ) operating in photon counting mode. Spectra were recorded and processed with DM3000f operating software, version 2.1 (SPEX Industries Inc., Edison, NJ). For emission scans, slit width was set at 1 nm. Excitation wavelengths were as follows: Prodan, 360 nm; ANS, 372 nm; bis-ANS, 393 nm; tryptophan, 295 nm. All spectra were background corrected. Far-UV CD spectrometry was performed on an AVIV Associates 62DS circular dichroism spectrometer (AVIV Associates, Lakewood, NJ). Samples were analyzed in a 1-mm path length quartz cuvette at 37 °C. GRP94 samples (1 μm) were prepared in standard phosphate-buffered saline solution as buffer A produced unacceptable dynode voltages in the relevant region of the spectrum. GRP94 was incubated with 10 μm bis-ANS for 2 h at 37 °C prior to obtaining spectra. Spectra were recorded from 300 to 195 nm. The α-helical content of GRP94 was calculated from the molar ellipticity at 222 nm (41Myers J.S. Jakoby W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 3785-3789Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The conformational state of GRP94 was assessed by tryptic digestion of the protein and subsequent SDS-PAGE analysis. For simple proteolysis experiments, 10 μl of a 0.5 mg/ml GRP94 stock, with or without prior heat shock, was combined with 1 μl of bis-ANS and/or radicicol stock solutions and incubated for the indicated times at 37 °C. Samples were then combined with 0.1% trypsin and digested for 30 min at 37 °C. An equal volume of SDS-PAGE sample buffer was added and the samples were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen. Immediately prior to gel analysis, samples were thawed and boiled for 5 min. Samples were then separated on 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Gels were fixed and stained with Coomassie Blue. For time course experiments, excess free bis-ANS was removed immediately prior to trypsinization by gel filtration on 0.5-ml G-25 Sephadex spin columns. The bis-ANS-binding region of GRP94 was identified by covalent incorporation of bis-ANS into GRP94 following the bis-ANS photolysis procedures described in Refs. 42Sharma K.K. Kumar G.S. Murphy A.S.

Methods Enzymol. 1998; 290: 318-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar. Briefly, 50 μg of GRP94 was combined with 50 μm bis-ANS in a final volume of 100 μl and photocross-linked for 15 min on ice with a 366-nm hand-held UV lamp (Ultra-violet Products, Inc., San Gabriel, CA). Following photocross-linking, GRP94-bis-ANS complexes were digested with trypsin for 1 h at 37 °C. The trypsin-derived limit digestion products were then separated by C-18 reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography using a continuous acetonitrile/water gradient in 20 mm ammonium bicarbonate, with sequential detection by UV absorbance (220 nm) and fluorescence emission (excitation 418 nm; emission 498 nm). The major resultant fluorescent peak was collected and the corresponding peptide sequenced by Edman degradation on an Applied Biosystems Procise model 492 automated protein sequencer. The oligomeric state of GRP94 was assayed by blue native-PAGE as described previously (44Schagger H. Cramer W.A. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 217: 220-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (1026) Google Scholar). GRP94 was either heat shocked or exposed to a 10-fold molar excess of bis-ANS for the indicated times. Samples were then dissolved in 15% glycerol and loaded onto 5–18% gradient gels with 0.02% Coomassie Brilliant Blue in the cathode buffer. Gels were run at 4 °C, stained with Coomassie Blue, destained, and dried. The effects of GRP94 on the thermal aggregation of citrate synthase were assayed by the methods of Buchner and colleagues (45Buchner J. Grallert H. Jakob U. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 290: 323-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Samples containing no protein, or GRP94 (1 μm), were incubated in 40 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, for 2 h at 37 °C with either 0.2%N,N-dimethylformamide or 10 μm bis-ANS. The samples were then warmed to 43 °C for 5 min and placed in a spectrofluorometer thermostatted at 43 °C. Citrate synthase was then added to 0.15 μm final concentration and the thermal aggregation of the enzyme followed by light scattering. Excitation and emission wavelengths were both 500 nm with 2 nm slit width. The time course of citrate synthase aggregation was followed for 1000 s. Iodination of VSV8 was performed by the Iodo-Beads procedure (Pierce Chemical Co.), and unincorporated125I was removed by fractionation on a Sep-Pak C18 reverse-phase cartridge. Iodinated peptide was mixed with unlabeled peptide to yield a final specific activity of 6.0 μCi/mg. GRP94 (4.7 μg, final concentration 0.5 μm) was incubated with an equimolar quantity of bis-ANS in 0.1% N,N-dimethylformamide in 100 μl of buffer A for 3.5 h at 37 °C. Samples were then incubated for an additional 30 min at 37 °C, or heat shocked for 15 min at 50 °C and allowed to recover for 15 min at 37 °C. A 10-fold molar excess of 125I-VSV8 was added (final concentration, 5 μm) and the mixture incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. All incubations were performed in the dark to prevent bis-ANS degradation. Samples were then eluted on 1.2-ml Sephadex G-75 spin columns preblocked with 75 μg of bovine serum albumin, and125I was quantitated by γ-counting. Recent studies on the conformational regulation of GRP94 have identified a tertiary structural change that occurs in response to heat shock and is associated with an activation of peptide binding activity (21Wearsch P.A. Voglino L. Nicchitta C.V. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5709-5719Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 22Sastry S. Linderoth N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12023-12035Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Coincident with the heat shock-elicited conformational change, GRP94 displays enhanced binding of environment sensitive fluorescent probes such as Nile Red, which preferentially bind to hydrophobic domains (21Wearsch P.A. Voglino L. Nicchitta C.V. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5709-5719Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). GRP94 contains two domains of significant hydrophobicity, a C-terminal assembly domain and a highly conserved N-terminal region, which corresponds to the Hsp90 geldanamycin and adenosine nucleotide-binding site (24Prodromou C. Roe S.M. O'Brien R. Ladbury J.E. Piper P.W. Pearl L.H. Cell. 1997; 90: 65-75Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1098) Google Scholar, 46Stebbins C.E. Russo A.A. Schneider C. Rosen N. Hartl F.U. Pavletich N.P. Cell. 1997; 89: 239-250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1222) Google Scholar). To characterize the structural basis for the heat shock-dependent activation of GRP94 activity, the interaction of polarity-sensitive fluorophores with native and heat-shocked GRP94 was examined. The three probes tested, Prodan (6-propionyl-2-(dimethylamino)naphthalene), 8-ANS, and bis-ANS are structurally related probes which bind to hydrophobic sites on proteins and undergo substantial fluorescence spectrum changes upon introduction into nonpolar environments (34Shi L. Palleros D.R. Fink A.L. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7536-7546Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 35Rosen C.G. Weber G. Biochemistry. 1969; 8: 3915-3920Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 36Takashi R. Tonomura Y. Morales M.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 2334-2338Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 47Weber G. Farris F.J. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 3075-3078Crossref PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar). The following experimental protocol was utilized. GRP94 was warmed to 37 °C and either maintained at 37 °C or heat shocked for 15 min at 50 °C, followed by incubation at 37 °C. Subsequently, probe was added to the GRP94 solution and emission spectra recorded after 30 min at 37 °C. As depicted in Fig. 1 A, the emission maxima of Prodan in the presence of native or heat-shocked GRP94 were essentially identical, indicating that Prodan does not interact with the hydrophobic binding pocket(s) displayed by heat-shocked GRP94. In contrast, the structurally related probe, 8-ANS, displays weak interactions with native GRP94, yet binds avidly following heat shock (Fig. 1 B). At present, it is not known if 8-ANS binding to native GRP94 represents the binding of 8-ANS to a weakly hydrophobic site present on the entire population of molecules or whether 8-ANS binds to a strongly hydrophobic site present on a small fraction of native GRP94 molecules, but uniformly represented on the heat shocked population of GRP94. The interaction of bis-ANS with GRP94 was complex, and displayed clear time and concentration dependence. As depicted in Fig. 1, Cand D, the initial bis-ANS binding to native GRP94 was biphasic and following extended incubations in the presence of bis-ANS, a level of fluorophore binding similar to that seen with heat-shocked GRP94 was observed. Maximal bis-ANS binding to heat-shocked GRP94 occurred very rapidly and under the described experimental setting, could not be time resolved. At 10-fold higher probe and protein concentrations (as used in later experiments) bis-ANS binding to native GRP94 was much more rapid, with 85% maximal binding occurring in 1 h (data not shown). These data suggest that maximal bis-ANS binding to GRP94 required a slow structural transition. This transition may represent a bis-ANS elicited conformational change in GRP94 and/or the bis-ANS dependent stabilization of a distinct conformational state accessed by the native protein. To determine the affinity of bis-ANS for GRP94, bis-ANS was added to increasing concentrations of heat-shocked GRP94, the fluorescence spectrum was determined, and the emission intensity at 475 nm plotted as a function of GRP94 concentration (Fig.2, A and B). Under the described experimental conditions, bis-ANS binding to GRP94 was near-maximal at a 20-fold molar excess of GRP94 monomer over bis-ANS. From the Klotz plot (59Klotz I.M. Hunston D.L. Biochemistry. 1971; 10: 3065-3069Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar, 60Cardamone M. Puri N.K. Biochem. J. 1992; 282: 589-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar), a Kd of 110 nm for GRP94-bis-ANS interactions was determined. In this experimental format, where the ligand concentration is constant and the receptor concentration is varied, the Kd value more accurately indicates the concentration of unbound receptor (GRP94) at which the ligand (bis-ANS) is 50% saturated (Fig. 2 B). From a mathematical standpoint, however, the determinedKd value is identical to that viewed from a more traditional perspective, where the Kd represents that concentration of ligand at which the receptor is 50% occupied. Importantly, these data indicate that bis-ANS binds in a saturable manner to heat-shocked GRP94. As mentioned previously, bis-ANS serves both as a probe of GRP94 conformation, in that it preferentially binds to the conformation accessed by GRP94 during heat shock, and as a ligand to elicit such a conformational change. Regarding the former, additional experiments were performed to further characterize the temperature dependence of the heat shock-elicited conformational change. Fig. 2 Cdepicts an experiment in which GRP94 (50 μg/ml) was incubated for 15 h at temperatures ranging from 4 to 50 °C, and the relative efficiency of conversion to the heat shock conformation determined following addition of 5 μm bis-ANS. As depicted in Fig.2 C, a small but reproducible increase in the GRP94 fraction present in the heat shock conformation was observed following extended incubation at 37 °C (as compared with paired incubation at 4 °C). Under the described experimental conditions, the temperature-dependent structural transition is half-maximal at 42 °C, and maximal at 45 °C (Fig. 2 C). Because swine, the source organism for the GRP94 used in this study, commonly achieve febrile body temperatures of 41–42 °C during periods of bacterial or viral infection, 2M. Morrow, personal communication. the conformational change identified in these studies may represent a physiologically relevant mechanism for regulating GRP94 activity. Following an extended incubation period, the emission spectra of bis-ANS bound to native GRP94 bears substantial similarity to that emission spectra of bis-ANS bound to heat shocked GRP94 (Fig. 1 C). Because heat shock is known to elicit a stable tertiary conformational change in GRP94 (21Wearsch P.A. Voglino L. Nicchitta C.V. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5709-5719Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) these data suggest that the binding of bis-ANS to GRP94 induces, or stabilizes, a conformational change similar to that occurring in response to heat shock. To determine whether the GRP94 conformation seen upon addition of bis-ANS is similar to that observed following heat shock, a series of structural studies on the bis-ANS·GRP94 complex was performed. In one series of experiments, the proteolysis patterns of native, heat-shocked, and bis-ANS-treated GRP94 were examined. As shown in Fig.3 A, lanes 2 and 3, incubation of native GRP94 with low levels of trypsin yields two prominent proteolysis products, representing known structural domains of the protein (24Prodromou C. Roe S.M. O'Brien R. Ladbury J.E. Piper P.W. Pearl L.H. Cell. 1997; 90: 65-75Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1098) Google Scholar, 46Stebbins C.E. Russo A.A. Schneider C. Rosen N.

Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 16760-16769Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). In contrast, proteolysis of either bis-ANS-treated or heat-shocked GRP94 yields a substantially reduced recovery of these prominent proteolysis products, with the concomitant appearance of a diverse array of proteolytic fragments of higher SDS-PAGE mobility. Essentially identical proteolysis patterns were observed following either heat shock or bis-ANS treatment of Hsp90 (data not shown). These data provide evidence that bis-ANS binding to GRP94 elicits or stabilizes GRP94 in a conformation similar to that occurring in response to heat shock, suggesting that there exists a GRP94 conformational state that can be readily accessed and/or stabilized by either heat shock or ligand (bis-ANS) binding. When purified from tissue, GRP94 exists as a homodimer (40Wearsch P.A. Nicchitta C.V. Pr"

We have evidenced a physical and functional interaction between members of two unrelated transcription factor families, Ets-1, Ets-2 and Stat5, which could contribute to the proliferative response to interleukin 2. Competition with GAS- and EBS-specific oligonucleotides and immunoassays with a set of anti-Stat and anti-Ets families revealed that the IL-2-induced Stat5-Ets complex recognizes several GAS motifs identified as target sites for activated Stat5 dimers. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments evidenced that a Stat5/Ets-1/2 complex is formed in vivo in absence of DNA. GST-pull down experiments demonstrated that the C-terminal domain of Ets-1 is sufficient for this interaction in vitro. Cotransfection experiments in Kit225 T cells resulted in cooperative transcriptional activity between both transcription factors in response to a combination of IL-2, PMA and ionomycin. A Stat5-Ets protein complex was the major inducible DNA-binding complex bound to the human IL-2rE GASd/EBSd motif in long-term proliferating normal human T cells activated by CD2 and CD28. These results suggest that the inducible Stat5-Ets protein interaction plays a role in the regulation of gene expression in response to IL-2 in human T lymphocytes."

Priming, which prepares vacuoles for productive association, requires Sec17p (the yeast homolog of α-SNAP), Sec18p (the yeast NSF, an ATP-driven chaperone), and ATP. Sec17p is initially an integral part of the cis-SNARE complex together with vacuolar SNARE proteins and Sec18p (NSF).

Priming is required for productive vacuole association, termed docking (12Mayer A. Wickner W. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 307-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Docking occurs in two ordered subreactions, reversible tethering and an irreversibletrans-SNARE pairing (13Ungermann C. Sato K. Wickner W. Nature. 1998; 396: 543-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Tethering is initiated by the transfer of Vam2/6p, liberated from the cis-SNARE complex during priming, to Ypt7p, a vacuolar Rab-like GTP binding protein (14Price A. Seals D. Wickner W. Ungermann C. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 1231-1248Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Tethering leads to trans-SNARE pairing, thereby forming stably docked vacuoles (13Ungermann C. Sato K. Wickner W. Nature. 1998; 396: 543-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Docking induces a flux of calcium out of the vacuole (15Peters C. Mayer A. Nature. 1998; 396: 575-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar), which interacts with a complex of calmodulin and protein phosphatase 1 to drive its vacuole association (16Peters C. Anderson P.D. Stark M.J.R. Cesaro-Tadic S. Glatz A. Podtelejnikov A. Mann M. Mayer A. Science. 1999; 285: 1084-1087Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). While the target(s) of protein phosphatase 1 are not yet known, their dephosphorylation is needed for LMA1 release (11Xu Z. Sato K. Wickner W. Cell. 1998; 93: 1125-1134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) and for fusionper se. We now report that Sec17p can stabilize or even drive the reassembly of vacuolar cis-SNARE complexes, which are otherwise labile. These findings lead to a hypothesis that the displacement of Sec17p by the action of Sec18p may actually cause cis-SNARE complex disassembly rather than being a mere consequence of it. Saccharomyces cerevisiaestrain BJ3505 (MATα,pep4::HIS3, prb1-Δ1.6R,HIS3, lys2-208, trp1-Δ101,ura3-52, gal2, can) and DKY6281 (MATα, leu2-3, leu2-112,ura3-52, his3-Δ200, trp1-Δ901,lys2-801, suc2-Δ9,pho8::TRP1) were obtained from Dr. D. Klionsky (University of California, Davis, CA). The ts mutant strain RSY387 sec17-2 and its parental wild type strain RSY255 (MATα, ura3-52, leu2-3, 112) were obtained from Dr. Charles Barlowe (Dartmouth Medical School). SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE), immunoblotting using ECL, affinity purification of antibodies, his6-Sec17p, and his6-Sec18p were as described by Haas (17Haas A. Methods Cell Sci. 1995; 17: 283-294Crossref Scopus (99) Google Scholar) and Haas and Wickner (18Haas A. Wickner W. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3296-3305Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Quinacrine, cyclopiazonic acid, and apyrase (grade VII) were purchased from Sigma. Vacuoles were isolated as described previously (6Mayer A. Wickner W. Haas A. Cell. 1996; 85: 83-94Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar, 19Haas A. Conradt B. Wickner W. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 87-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) and diluted as needed with PS buffer (10 mm Pipes/KOH, pH 6.8, 200 mm sorbitol). Standard vacuole fusion assays (30 μl) were as described (19Haas A. Conradt B. Wickner W. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 87-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Fresh vacuoles from BJ3505 and DKY6281 (3 μg each) were mixed in fusion buffer (10 mm Pipes/KOH, pH 6.8, 200 mmsorbitol, 150 mm KOAc, 5 mm MgCl2), ATP regenerating system (1 mm ATP, 40 mmcreatine phosphate, 0.2 mg/ml creatine phosphokinase), proteinase inhibitors (3.3 μm Pefabloc SC, 0.1 ng/ml leupeptin, 16.6 μm o-phenanthroline, 16.6 ng/ml pepstatin; 20Xu Z. Wickner W. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 132: 787-794Crossref Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Cytosol was prepared as described (17Haas A. Methods Cell Sci. 1995; 17: 283-294Crossref Scopus (99) Google Scholar) and added to fusion reactions where indicated. One unit of fusion activity is defined as 1 μmol of p-nitrophenyl phosphate hydrolyzed per minute per microgram of vacuole from BJ3505. Vacuoles were solubilized in 500 μl of IP buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 6.8, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 30 μm Pefabloc SC, 30 ng/ml leupeptin, 15 μm o-phenanthroline, 150 ng/ml pepstatin, 1% Triton X-100) by rotating for 15 min at 4 °C. Unsolubilized material was removed by centrifugation (14,000 rpm, 10 min, 4 °C). A portion (5%) of the detergent extract was saved prior to immunoprecipitation. Protein A-agarose beads coupled with IgGs were added to the detergent extract and incubated on a Nutator rocking shaker for 2 h at 4 °C. The beads were twice re-isolated by a 30-s centrifugation at 14,000 rpm, resuspended each time with 500 μl of IP buffer and incubated for 10 min at 4 °C. Proteins were eluted from the beads by 0.1 m glycine-Cl (pH 2.2) and neutralized with 1 m Tris-Cl (pH 10). Eluates were mixed with SDS-sample buffer and heated at 95 °C for 3 min and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. To assay homotypic vacuole fusion, we isolate vacuoles from two yeast strains. BJ3505 is deleted for the genes encoding vacuole lumenal proteases A and B and thus accumulates the catalytically inactive pro-alkaline phosphatase. DKY6281 contains normal vacuolar proteases but is deleted for the gene encoding alkaline phosphatase. Neither population of vacuoles has alkaline phosphatase activity. Upon vacuole fusion, the lumenal contents mix and the pro-alkaline phosphatase is proteolytically activated. The active enzyme is assayed spectrophotometrically as a measure of membrane fusion (17Haas A. Methods Cell Sci. 1995; 17: 283-294Crossref Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 19Haas A. Conradt B. Wickner W. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 87-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Recombinant Sec17p was added to the fusion assay. Very low levels of this protein caused a minor stimulation of fusion, but vacuole fusion was inhibited as increasing Sec17p was added (Fig.1 A). Standard fusion reactions have 6 μg of vacuoles, which bear 6 ng of Sec17p (Fig.1 B). To achieve 90% inhibition (Fig. 1 A), recombinant Sec17p had to be added to approximately 15-fold greater level than the endogenous (6 ng endogenous versus 30 μl × 3 ng/μl added). To test whether this inhibition was specific, purified Sec18p was added to fusion reactions in the presence or absence of added Sec17p. High levels of Sec18p completely overcame the inhibition by excess Sec17p (Fig. 1 C), whereas there was little stimulation of fusion by excess Sec18p alone. The ability of Sec18p (but not calmodulin or LMA1; data not shown) to overcome the inhibition by exogenous Sec17p suggests that the inhibitory effect of excess Sec17p is specific. Inhibition by excess Sec17p occurs on the vacuole membrane (Fig.1 D). Vacuoles were preincubated with Sec17p and then re-isolated to remove unbound protein (lanes 4–6). Almost no fusion took place (lane 5) unless Sec18p was added (lane 6), whereas, in vacuoles preincubated with buffer, fusion was not significantly stimulated by Sec18p (lanes 2and 3). This observation argues against a sequestration of soluble fusion components by excess Sec17p in solution but supports the idea that excess Sec17p inhibits by binding to vacuole membranes and blocking at a site that can be relieved by Sec18p. Vacuole fusion occurs in ordered reactions of priming, docking, and bilayer fusion. Sec18p and Sec17p normally function together to disassemble the cis-SNARE complex during priming and are not required for the later subreactions of docking and fusion. The reaction acquires resistance to inhibitors of priming before it becomes resistant to inhibitors of docking (6Mayer A. Wickner W. Haas A. Cell. 1996; 85: 83-94Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar). Because priming does not require vacuole-to-vacuole contact, we asked whether the reaction becomes resistant to added Sec17p prior to vacuole mixing and found that it does not (Fig. 2 A,triangles), even though it becomes resistant to antibody to Sec17p (filled squares). This suggests that the added excess Sec17p acts after the endogenous Sec17p is normally released. To determine whether Sec17p inhibited steps after priming, we measured the sensitivity of the reaction to inhibitors that were added at various times. This type of experiment tells us the latest stage that is sensitive to each inhibitor. A large fusion reaction was started and, at different times, aliquots were either transferred to ice as a measure of fusion that had occurred, were mixed with different antibodies, or were mixed with excess Sec17p. Each incubation was then continued at 27 °C or on ice for a total of 60-min incubation (Fig.2 B). When added from the start, each inhibitor abolished fusion. After 10–15 min, the reaction was largely resistant to antibodies to Sec17p, indicating that Sec17p was no longer required after priming. The kinetic course of fusion sensitivity to excess Sec17p was coincident with that of anti-Vam3, and both were well separated from the ice curve, indicating that excess Sec17p did not inhibit bilayer fusion per se. However, under this reaction condition with a high vacuole concentration, docking had occurred quite soon after priming. To better distinguish between priming and docking, we employed the same assay but with diluted vacuoles (Fig.2 C). Docking, assayed by acquired resistance to anti-Vam3p or anti-Ypt7p, was slowed significantly while priming, measured by the early acquired resistance to anti-Sec17p and anti-Sec18p, was not affected. Resistance to added Sec17p was still acquired with the same kinetics as resistance to other inhibitors of docking. These data suggest that the latest stage of the reaction which is sensitive to excess Sec17p is docking. Because docking requires vacuole acidification (21Ungermann C.U. Wickner W. Xu Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11194-11199Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), we measured the effect of Sec17p on the vacuole accumulation of quinacrine in response to its ATP-driven acidification (Fig. 2 D) but found that there was no effect. To confirm that the final, bilayer fusion stage of the reaction is not affected by excess Sec17p, a staging experiment was performed using the calcium chelator BAPTA (Fig. 3). BAPTA reversibly inhibits the bilayer fusion stage of the reaction without affecting priming and docking (15Peters C. Mayer A. Nature. 1998; 396: 575-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar, 21Ungermann C.U. Wickner W. Xu Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11194-11199Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Vacuoles were incubated with ATP in the presence of BAPTA for 30 min to allow the completion of priming and docking, then centrifuged and resuspended to remove the BAPTA. Very little fusion had occurred by 30 min in the presence of BAPTA (Fig. 3, lane 7). Vacuoles retained significant ability to fuse (lane 6), and this fusion had become fully resistant to either anti-Vam3p (lane 10) or excess Sec17p (lane 9), though either inhibitor blocked fusion efficiently if added from the beginning of the reaction (lanes 4 and 5). Thus excess Sec17p does not inhibit the final step of bilayer fusion. To determine whether subreactions of docking such as tethering and trans-SNARE pairing, which follow priming, can occur while the reaction is blocked by excess Sec17p, vacuoles were incubated for 15 min at 27 °C in the presence of excess Sec17p (Fig.4, lanes 15–21). The blockade of the fusion reaction (lane 15) was largely overcome by the addition of Sec18 during second incubation (lane 16), and this rescue of the reaction by Sec18p required ATP (lane 17). Therefore, excess Sec17p did not allow the reaction to proceed beyond a stage that still required priming. The reaction also had not fulfilled its requirements for Ypt7p (lane 18), for Vam2p (lane 20), which is a subunit of the Ypt7 effector complex (14Price A. Seals D. Wickner W. Ungermann C. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 1231-1248Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar), and for the t-SNARE Vam3p (lane 19), as judged by continued sensitivity to antibody to these proteins, though the need for these proteins would have been fulfilled by 15 min in the absence of his6-Sec17p (lanes 9–14). To further resolve the mechanism of excess Sec17p inhibition of early reaction steps, we employed the biochemical assays of Sec17p release and cis-SNARE complex disassembly. Endogenous Sec17p underwent ATP-dependent release from the vacuoles into the supernatant (Fig. 5, lanes 1and 2), and this release was not affected by excess Sec17p (lane 3). Because priming also entails the dissociation of cis-SNARE complexes (10Ungermann C. Nichols B.J. Pelham H.R.B. Wickner W. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 61-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar), we used the co-immunoprecipitation of the v-SNARE Nyv1p by antibody to the t-SNARE Vam3p to measure the disassembly of cis-SNARE associations (Fig.6). In contrast to the ATP-dependent disassembly under normal fusion conditions (lanes 1 and 2), cis-SNARE associations were preserved or re-formed in the presence of excess Sec17p (lane 3). These findings suggest that Sec17p normally stabilizes the cis-SNARE complex, that it must be displaced by Sec18p before the cis-SNARE complex can be disassembled, and that added exogenous Sec17p cannot prevent the release of endogenous Sec17p but can associate with the vacuole rapidly and either interrupt cis-SNARE complex disassembly or even drive reassembly.Figure 6Sec17p promotes cis-SNARE associations. Vacuoles (60 μg) were incubated in fusion buffer (10 mm Pipes/KOH, pH 6.8, 200 mm sorbitol, 150 mm KCl, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm MnCl2, 0.1× protease inhibitor cocktail) with (lanes 2–4) or without (lane 1) ATP and with (lanes 3 and 4) or without (lanes 1 and 2) excess his6-Sec17p (30 ng/μl) as indicated. One reaction also received purified his6-Sec18p (250 ng/μl) (lane 4). After 10 min at 27 °C, vacuoles were sedimented (10 min, 10,000 rpm, 4 °C) and solubilized for immunoprecipitation analysis with immobilized antibodies to Vam3p as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Immunoprecipitates were eluted from beads and analyzed by immunoblot after SDS-PAGE.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Thermosensitive mutants in the SEC17 gene provide another means to explore the Sec17p function in cis-SNARE complex stability. Vacuoles were purified from wild-type cells or from the sec17-2 mutant, which had been grown at the permissive temperature of 23 °C. Immunoprecipitation analysis of detergent extracts of these vacuoles with antibodies to the v-SNARE Vti1p showed coprecipitation of Sec17p and Vam3p (Fig.7, A and B,lane 1), indicating an intact SNARE complex. Preincubation of spheroplasts at 37 °C for 10 min (lane 2) or 20 min (lane 3) prior to isolation of the vacuoles resulted in progressive loss of SNARE complex from cells with the Sec17-2p (Fig.7 A) but not from wild-type cells (Fig. 7 B), in striking contrast to the increased levels of SNARE complex seen in Sec18-1 cells (10Ungermann C. Nichols B.J. Pelham H.R.B. Wickner W. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 61-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Although SNARE complex disassembly is a necessary step of priming, the loss of integrity of this complex by thermal denaturation of the temperature-sensitive Sec17-2p did not promote the overall reaction but, rather, led to its diminution (data not shown). Thus, Sec17p both stabilizes the cis-SNARE complex and fulfills a positive function beyond the disassembly of this complex in the priming reaction. SNAP proteins were discovered, and named, as soluble NSF attachment proteins (22Weidman P.J. Melancon P. Block M.R. Rothman J.E. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 1589-1596Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 23Clary D.O. Griff I.C. Rothman J.E. Cell. 1990; 61: 709-721Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar), and Sec17p was shown to be its yeast homologue (24Griff I.C. Schekman R. Rothman J.E. Kaiser C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12106-12115Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Further biochemical studies established that SNAP proteins bind to syntaxin, SNAP-25, or to trimeric 7S complexes of syntaxin, SNAP-25, and synaptobrevin (2Sollner T. Bennett M.K. Whiteheart S.W. Scheller R. Rothman J.E. Cell. 1993; 75: 409-418Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1564) Google Scholar, 25Hanson P.I. Otto H. Barton N. Jahn R. J. Biol.

Cell. 1999; 4: 85-95Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) has suggested models of NSF/SNAP/SNARE interactions. SNAP proteins are essential for the disassembly of the 7S SNARE oligomer mediated by NSF and ATP (2Sollner T. Bennett M.K. Whiteheart S.W. Scheller R. Rothman J.E.

However, it has not been previously known whether the role of SNAP is limited to mediating the membrane attachment of NSF. Furthermore, the stability of the 7S complex of neural SNAREs to exposure to even heat or SDS (29Hayashi T. Yamasaki S. Nauenberg S. Binz T. Niemann H. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2317-2325Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar, 27Fasshauer D. Otto H. Eliason W.K. Jahn R. Brunger A.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28036-28041Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar) has masked whether SNAP protein can also contribute directly to SNARE complex stability. α-SNAP has also been found to prevent the ATP-driven release of NSF from membranes, perhaps through mediating reattachment (32Tagaya M. Furuno A. Mizushima S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 466-470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The yeast cis-SNARE complex is labile, 2C. Ungermann, unpublished observations. and our current studies suggest that Sec17p association contributes to its stability. Our studies provide new insights into the cis-SNARE complex and the priming stage of vacuole fusion. Though purified, recombinant neuronal SNAREs will spontaneously form a stable 7S complex that is resistant to SDS (33Otto H. Hanson P.I. Jahn R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6197-6201Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar), and the associations of purified vacuolar SNAREs are far more labile. The isolable vacuolar cis-SNARE complex contains Sec17p (10Ungermann C. Nichols B.J. Pelham H.R.B. Wickner W. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 61-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 34Sato K. Wickner W. Science. 1998; 281: 700-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). We postulate that Sec17p association stabilizes the cis associations of vacuolar SNAREs and that the ATP-driven displacement of Sec17p by Sec18p causes the disassembly of the cis-SNARE complex by removing the Sec17p “glue,” which had held it together. In addition, Sec17p has a positive role in making this disassembly reaction productive for the further steps that lead to fusion, possibly through activation of the t-SNARE. Sec17p can apparently associate with primed vacuoles, and may even promote re-assembly of some components of the cis-SNARE complex, but this can again be reversed by the action of Sec18p and ATP. The concentration of released Sec17p in our standard in vitrofusion reactions is far less than that needed to drive the reformation of cis-SNARE associations (Fig. 1). Priming releases endogenous Sec17p, and the ensuing tethering reaction is fully reversible (12Mayer A. Wickner W. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 307-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 13Ungermann C. Sato K. Wickner W. Nature. 1998; 396: 543-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Thus, even after priming is complete, the reversibility of tethering allows the addition of high levels of Sec17p to block the overall reaction (Fig. 1 A).trans-SNARE pairing renders docking irreversible (13Ungermann C. Sato K. Wickner W. Nature. 1998; 396: 543-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar), and the reaction thereby becomes resistant to excess added Sec17p. Though the blockade by excess Sec17p is fully reversible by Sec18p (Figs.1 C, 1 D, and 4), vacuoles blocked by excess Sec17p cannot complete even the Vam2/6p- and Ypt7p-dependent tethering reaction until the block by Sec17p is reversed by the addition of Sec18p (Fig. 4). This model of Sec17p function is the simplest explanation for our current findings, though further studies are needed to establish whether this novel proposed function of Sec17p is physiologically important and whether it applies to other trafficking reactions. However, the physiological relevance of our findings is supported by the observation (Fig. 7) that a defective Sec17p causes lability of its cis-SNARE complex. This is in contrast to the stabilization of this complex by thermodenaturation of Sec18p (10Ungermann C. Nichols B.J. Pelham H.R.B. Wickner W. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 61-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar), and the lack of effect of excess Sec18p on fusion (13Ungermann C. Sato K. Wickner W. Nature. 1998; 396: 543-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar) and suggests that Sec17p has a distinct role in stabilizingcis-SNARE complexes. The cis-SNARE complex, which includes Sec17p, is not merely a residual complex of trans-SNARE associations that is converted to “cis” upon membrane fusion. Rather, it contains Sec17p, Sec18p (10Ungermann C. Nichols B.J. Pelham H.R.B. Wickner W. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 61-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar), its bound LMA1 co-chaperone (11Xu Z. Sato K. Wickner W. Cell. 1998; 93: 1125-1134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), and the multisubunit 38S Vam2/6p complex (14Price A. Seals D. Wickner W. Ungermann C. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 1231-1248Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) as well as the SNARE proteins. Although our current study suggests that Sec17p has a major role in stabilizing this complex, it will be important to determine the physiological pathway of assembly of the cis-SNARE complex at normal levels of Sec17p and, with pure components, to recapitulate effects of Sec17p on this assembly pathway. The size of this complex, which has been estimated to be 65S (14Price A. Seals D. Wickner W. Ungermann C. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 1231-1248Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar), suggests that this will be a daunting task. Further studies will also be needed to determine whether each of the components that is released from the cis-SNARE complex during the normal fusion reaction can reassemble with the SNAREs upon excess Sec17p addition.

https://openalex.org/W2025828060,"Human α1,3 fucosyltransferases (FucTs) contain four highly conserved cysteine (Cys) residues, in addition to a free Cys residue that lies near the binding site for GDP-fucose (Holmes, E. H., Xu, Z., Sherwood, A. L., and Macher, B. A. (1995)J. Biol. Chem. 270, 8145–8151). The participation of the highly conserved Cys residues in disulfide bonds and their functional significance were characterized by mass spectrometry (MS) analyses and site-directed mutagenesis, respectively. Among the human FucTs is a subset of enzymes (FucT III, V, and VI) having highly homologous sequences, especially in the catalytic domain, and Cys residues in FucT III and V were characterized. The amino acid sequence of FucT III was characterized. Peptides containing the four conserved Cys residues were detected after reduction and alkylation, and found to be involved in disulfide bonds. The disulfide bond pattern was characterized by multiple stage MS analysis and the use of Glu-C protease and MS/MS analysis. Disulfide bonds in FucT III occur between Cys residues (Cys81 to Cys338 and Cys91 to Cys341) at the N and C termini of the catalytic domain, bringing these ends close together in space. Mutagenesis of highly conserved Cys residues to Ser in FucT V resulted in proteins lacking enzymatic activity. Three of the four mutants have molecular weights similar to wild type enzyme and maintained an ability to bind GDP, whereas the other (Cys104) produced a series of lower molecular weight bands when characterized by Western blot analysis, and did not bind GDP. FucTs have highly conserved, potentialN-linked sites, and our mass spectrometry analyses demonstrated that both N-linked sites are modified with oligosaccharides. Human α1,3 fucosyltransferases (FucTs) contain four highly conserved cysteine (Cys) residues, in addition to a free Cys residue that lies near the binding site for GDP-fucose (Holmes, E. H., Xu, Z., Sherwood, A. L., and Macher, B. A. (1995)J. Biol. Chem. 270, 8145–8151). The participation of the highly conserved Cys residues in disulfide bonds and their functional significance were characterized by mass spectrometry (MS) analyses and site-directed mutagenesis, respectively. Among the human FucTs is a subset of enzymes (FucT III, V, and VI) having highly homologous sequences, especially in the catalytic domain, and Cys residues in FucT III and V were characterized. The amino acid sequence of FucT III was characterized. Peptides containing the four conserved Cys residues were detected after reduction and alkylation, and found to be involved in disulfide bonds. The disulfide bond pattern was characterized by multiple stage MS analysis and the use of Glu-C protease and MS/MS analysis. Disulfide bonds in FucT III occur between Cys residues (Cys81 to Cys338 and Cys91 to Cys341) at the N and C termini of the catalytic domain, bringing these ends close together in space. Mutagenesis of highly conserved Cys residues to Ser in FucT V resulted in proteins lacking enzymatic activity. Three of the four mutants have molecular weights similar to wild type enzyme and maintained an ability to bind GDP, whereas the other (Cys104) produced a series of lower molecular weight bands when characterized by Western blot analysis, and did not bind GDP. FucTs have highly conserved, potentialN-linked sites, and our mass spectrometry analyses demonstrated that both N-linked sites are modified with oligosaccharides. fucosyltransferase electrospray ionization Fucα1,2Galβ1,4GlcNAc liquid chromatography mass spectrometry N-ethylmaleimide phosphate-buffered saline polymerase chain reaction Galβ1,3GlcNAc multiple stage mass spectrometry polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis high performance liquid chromatography peptide:N-glycanase F 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid azidosalicyclic acid polyethylene oxide α1,3/4 fucosyltransferases (FucTs)1 have been cloned from a variety of species and share significant sequence homology (see Refs. 1Breton C.

Among the conserved residues in FucTs (including human, mouse, chicken, and zebra fish) are four cysteine (Cys) residues (Fig. 1). Two of these Cys residues are located near the N terminus and two near the C terminus of the catalytic domain. The Cys residues found at the C terminus also are conserved in FucTs from Caenorhabditis elegans (6DeBose-Boyd R.A. Nyame A.K. Cummings R.D. Glycobiology. 1998; 8: 905-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Among the human FucTs, FucTs III, V, and VI share substantial sequence homology. Within the catalytic domain only about 20 out of 300 amino acids vary among the three proteins. In addition, domain swapping experiments by our group (7Nguyen A.T. Holmes E.H. Whitaker J.M. Ho S. Shetterly S. Macher B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25244-25249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) and Lowe and co-workers (9Legault D.J. Kelly R.J. Natsuka Y.

Therefore, we have used two (FucT III and V) of these highly homologous proteins in the present study to evaluate the structure and functional significance of the highly conserved Cys residues. Protein chemistry experiments, coupled with mass spectrometry analyses, have been used to locate all peptides containing Cys residues in human FucT III, allowing them to be assigned either as being involved in a disulfide bond or as a free Cys residue, and identifying which Cys residues are bound to each other in disulfide linkages. The results support our (7Nguyen A.T. Holmes E.H. Whitaker J.M. Ho S. Shetterly S. Macher B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25244-25249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) previously stated hypothesis that amino acids affecting acceptor substrate specificity of human FucT III and V, located near the N and C termini of the catalytic domain, are brought close together in space by disulfide bonds between these highly conserved Cys residues. To investigate the importance of these Cys residues, we have mutated each of these Cys residues in human FucT V and evaluated the activity and other properties of each resulting protein construct. The results demonstrate that these residues affect enzyme activity, but not the interaction of the protein with GDP-Fuc in three of the four cases. In the case of one of the mutant constructs (Cys104) protein folding/stability is altered compared with the wild type protein. The amino acid sequences of FucTs have been predicted on the basis of cDNA sequences, but none of the amino acid sequences have been confirmed directly. Furthermore, little is known about sites of posttranslational modifications. Among the potential sites for posttranslational modification in FucTs, are Asn residues that may be substituted with N-linked glycans (Ref. 8Weston B.W. Smith P.L. Kelly R.J. Lowe J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24575-24584Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar and references therein). Among FucTs III, V, and VI, there are two highly conservedN-linked sites, plus others that are less highly conserved (i.e. they occur in FucTs V and VI, but not FucT III). From previous analyses (7Nguyen A.T. Holmes E.H. Whitaker J.M. Ho S. Shetterly S. Macher B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25244-25249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 9Legault D.J. Kelly R.J. Natsuka Y. Lowe J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20987-20996Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), it is clear that some, but not all, of these sites are posttranslationally modified. In the current study, a combination of proteolytic digestions and MS/MS analyses have been used to analyze the amino acid sequence of FucT III. This methodology in combination with PNGase F treatment has been used to locate Asn residues in FucT III that are glycosylated. Unlabeled GDP-Fuc was purchased from Calbiochem (San Diego, CA), and GDP-[3H]Fuc was purchased from NEN Life Science Products. The following items were obtained from HyClone Laboratories Inc. (Logan, UT): Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; 8.1 mmNa2HPO4, 1.5 mM KH2PO4, 137 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, pH 7.4), penicillin, streptomycin, and fetal calf serum. Rabbit IgG-agarose, anti-goat IgG-alkaline phosphatase conjugate, goat IgG, bovine serum albumin, 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate, nitro blue tetrazolium, and formamide were obtained from Sigma. PEO-maleimide-activated biotin was purchased from Pierce. PNGase F and chymotrypsin were purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals, and trypsin was obtained from Worthington Biochemical Corp. (Lakewood, NJ). SP-Sepharose was from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, and the GDP affinity resin was a gift from Dr. Ole Hindsgaul (Department of Chemistry, University of Alberta, Alberta, Canada). All other chemicals were obtained from commercial sources and were of the highest purity available. The truncated, wild type FucT V was described previously (7Nguyen A.T. Holmes E.H. Whitaker J.M.

Chem. 1998; 273: 25244-25249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) and used as a template to generate the Cys → Ser mutants at Cys94, Cys104, Cys351, and Cys354 and the double mutant Cys351 → Ser/Cys354 → Ser by PCR. To facilitate cloning of the mutants, a modified form of the FucT V coding sequence containing a NotI site at nucleotide base 984 of the FucT V sequence was generated by PCR mutagenesis. This new restriction site was used in PCR mutagenesis (7Nguyen A.T. Holmes E.H. Whitaker J.M. Ho S. Shetterly S. Macher B.A. J. Biol.

Mutations at the 5′ end of the FucT V coding region (Cys94 and Cys104 of FucT V) were introduced by recombinant PCR as described previously (7Nguyen A.T. Holmes E.H. Whitaker J.M. Ho S. Shetterly S.

Recombinant PCR was used to create Cys94 → Ser and Cys104 → Ser mutants. The flanking primers (A and D) were used in the second round of PCR to create the full-length PCR product that was inserted into pPROTA. The underlined segments are restriction sites that were used in subcloning or to screen for recombinants (GAATTC (EcoRI), ATTAAT (AseI), GGTACC (KpnI), GATATC (EcoRV)).

The resulting plasmids were propagated in the JM109 strain of E. coli and transfected into COS-7 cells. Wild type and mutant proteins were expressed as soluble proteins with an N-terminal protein A, IgG binding domain (11de Vries T. Srnka C.A. Palcic M.M. Swiedler S.J. van den Eijnden D.H. Macher B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8712-8722Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The fusion proteins were purified from the cell culture media by IgG-agarose column chromatography. Recombinant FucTs were detected and quantified via Western blot analysis (16Loo J.A. Edmonds C.G. Smith R.D. Anal. Chem. 1993; 65: 425-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). The standard reaction mixture contained: 50 mm MOPS/NaOH buffer, pH 6.5, 6.25 mm MnCl2, 0.05% bovine serum albumin, 3.0 nmol of GDP-Fuc, 0.01 μCi of GDP-[3H]Fuc, 20 nmol of acceptor, and 5 μl of the enzyme, and reactions were terminated by adding 400 μl of water. The reaction product was separated from substrate by reverse phase chromatography (Sep-Pak C18) and quantified as described previously (12Xu Z. Vo L. Macher B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8818-8823Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). GDP-hexanolamine-ASA was iodinated (see Ref. 13Holmes E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13150-13156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in reaction mixtures that contained two IODOBEADS (Pierce), 5 μmol sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, 1 mCi of Na125I, and H2O in a total volume of 60 μl. At the end of 15 min, 0.6 μmol of GDP-hexanolamine-ASA in 35 μl of H2O was added and incubated for an additional 15 min at room temperature. The reaction was stopped by removal of the solution from the IODOBEADS and labeled GDP-hexanolamine-ASA used in photolabeling experiments. Wild type FucT V and FucT V Cys mutant constructs expressed in COS-7 cells and adsorbed onto IgG-agarose beads were suspended in a 25% bead slurry in PBS. Aliquots (10 μl), each containing 350–540 ng of expressed protein, were dispensed in reaction mixtures, which also contained 0.5 μmol of sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, 0.625 μmol of125I-GDP-hexanolamine-ASA (approximately 1 × 107 cpm/nmol), with or without 20 μmol of GDP-Fuc, and H2O in a total volume of 50 μl in wells of a round-bottomed 96-well plate. The reaction mixtures were allowed to stand for 30 min at room temperature in the dark prior to photolysis at 254 nm for 1 min with a hand-held UV lamp placed directly above the wells. The beads were quantitatively transferred to 0.5-ml Eppendorf tubes, washed in PBS, and SDS gel sample buffer (Bio-Rad; 30 μl) was added. The tubes were heated at 100 °C for 10 min and centrifuged, and 25-μl aliquots were electrophoresed on 8.5% polyacrylamide gels. After electrophoresis, the gels were stained with Coomassie Blue, destained, and dried. The dried gels were exposed to X-Omat AR film to locate labeled protein. Labeled protein bands were cut out and quantified by counting in a γ counter. FucT III was expressed in Pichia pastoris as described previously (14Gallet P.H. Vaujour H. Petit J.M. Maftah A. Oulmouden A. Oriol R. Le Narvor C. Guilloton M. Julien R. Glycobiology. 1998; 8: 919-925Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). To purify FucT III, pellets were resuspended to an OD600 = 100 with 50 mm cacodylate, pH 7.0, 0.1 mmdithiothreitol. Lysis was achieved by glass bead beating using a bead beater. The beating chamber was filled with a 50/50 mixture of glass beads (Sigma acid-washed; 425–600 μm) and the resuspended pellet. Four lysis cycles were used to free the enzyme from the pelleted material (1 min beating and 2 min icing). Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 27,500 × g for 1 h, and the supernatant was used as the enzyme source. The enzyme was purified in a two-step procedure that included cation exchange (SP-Sepharose) and a GDP-resin affinity chromatographic procedures. The crude pellet lysate was loaded onto the SP-Sepharose column, which was equilibrated in 50 mm cacodylate, pH 7.0 buffer containing 1.0 mmdithiothreitol. The column (approximately 50 ml) was washed with 200 ml of the loading buffer, and the enzyme was eluted with loading buffer containing 0.3 m NaCl. Fractions containing FucT III activity were pooled and loaded onto a 4-ml GDP-hexanolamine affinity resin (∼3 μmol of ligand/ml of resin), which was equilibrated with a loading buffer containing 10 mm cacodylate, pH 7.0, 10 mm MgCl. The sample was applied at a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min and the column washed with 12 ml of loading buffer at the same flow rate. FucT III active fractions were eluted from the column with loading buffer containing 2 mm GDP at 0.2 ml/min. Fractions were analyzed for enzyme activity, and proteins by SDS-PAGE. One-ml fractions of FucT III (∼50 ng/μl) from the GDP-affinity column were concentrated by Centricon filtration to 40 μl (1 μg/μl, 10 mmcacodylate, 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mm GDP at pH 7.0). A 5-μl sample of the concentrated FucT III (∼ 5 μg) was incubated with a 20-fold molar excess of PEO-maleimide-activated biotin for 30 min in the dark at room temperature (total volume 6 μl). Biotin-labeled FucT III was denatured with urea (8.4 m) in a final volume of 9.1 μl for 30 min before tryptic digestion. The concentration of urea in the denatured FucT III sample was reduced to 2 m by adding water. Trypsin (1/5 ratio w/w of trypsin/protein) was added and the mixture (36.6 μl) was incubated overnight at 37 °C. Fractions of the tryptic digest of biotin modified FucT III eluted at 34–38 min were collected and dried by vacuum, and dissolved in 20 μl of ammonium bicarbonate buffer (100 mm, pH 7.9), and the endoproteinase Glu-C (1/10, w/w, enzyme/protein) was added. Digestion was carried out overnight at 37 °C. PNGase F was dissolved in 100 mm sodium phosphate, 25 mm EDTA at pH 7.2 at a concentration of 200 units/ml. PNGase F digestion was done on tryptic digests of FucT III by adding PNGase F to a final concentration of 20 units/ml, and the mixture was incubated overnight at 37 °C. LC/MS/MS analysis was performed using an LCQ ion trap mass spectrometer (Finnigan, San Jose, CA) with a modified electrospray ionization (ESI) source. A positive voltage of 3 kV was applied to the electrospray needle, and the temperature of the stainless steel heating capillary was maintained at 220 °C. A N2 sheath flow (65 scale) was applied to stabilize the ESI signal. The voltage at the exit of the heating capillary and the tube lens was held at 13 and 5 V, respectively, to minimize the source-induced dissociation and optimize the ESI signal of the analyte. The ion injection was controlled by automatic gain control to avoid the space charge effects. The full scan mass spectrum was acquired fromm/z = 300 to m/z = 2000. The MS/MS experiments were executed with a relative collision energy of 38%. The LC/MS analysis was conducted using a 1050 HPLC system (Hewlett-Packard, Palo Alto, CA) coupled to the LCQ. The HPLC system was operated at a flow rate of 0.25 ml/min. The mobile phase was split before the injector by a tee-connector. One end of the tee was connected to a capillary C18 column (150 × 0.18 mm; Nucleosil, 5-μm particle size) and a flow rate of 2 μl/min was established. The enzymatically digested peptides were eluted from the column using 0.5% formic acid in water (mobile phase A) and 0.5% formic acid in acetonitrile (mobile phase B) with a three-step linear gradient of 5–10% B in the first 10 min, 10–35% B in the next 40 min and 35–40% B in the last 5 min. The LC/MS/MS analysis was accomplished using an automated data acquisition procedure, in which a cyclic series of three different scan modes were performed. Data acquisition was conducted using the full scan mode to obtain the most intense peak (signal > 1.5 × 105 counts) as the precursor ion, followed by a high resolution zoom scan mode to determine the charge state of the precursor ion and an MS/MS scan mode to determine the structural fragment ions of the precursor ion. The resulting MS/MS spectra were then searched against a protein data base (Owl) by Sequest to confirm the sequence of tryptic peptides. Multiple stage (MS3) analysis was performed by selecting a fragment ion from the MS/MS analysis as the precursor ion to generate the MS3 spectrum. The relative collisional energy for the MS/MS and MS3analyses was set from 30% to 43%. Six human FucTs have been cloned (FucT III to FucT VII and FucT IX). A comparison of the distribution of Cys residues among these enzymes demonstrates that there are four highly conserved Cys residues (see Fig. 1), which are also highly conserved in FucTs from other species. The importance of these conserved Cys residues for protein structure (e.g. disulfide bond formation) and enzyme activity is unknown. Therefore, a series of protein chemistry/mass spectrometry and site-directed mutagenesis studies have been carried out to provide the first information on the structure/function relationships of these highly conserved Cys residues. The availability of a yeast expression system for FucT III provided an opportunity to obtain a sufficient quantity of enzyme for a complete characterization of the protein's amino acid sequence, its disulfide bond pattern and the location of N-linked glycosylation. FucT III was expressed as a soluble protein in P. pastoris (14Gallet P.H. Vaujour H. Petit J.M. Maftah A. Oulmouden A. Oriol R. Le Narvor C. Guilloton M. Julien R. Glycobiology. 1998; 8: 919-925Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) and purified in a two-step process that yielded a single Coomassie-stained band by SDS-PAGE. Fractions containing this protein band were highly active (specific activity: 1200 nmol/min mg protein) for fucosyltransferase activity with a type I acceptor. In-gel tryptic digestion products of the band detected on the SDS-PAGE contained peptides derived from the FucT III sequence, and there was no conclusive evidence for the presence of any other protein contaminants (data not shown). A complete peptide sequence analysis of the purified protein solution (reduced with dithiothreitol and alkylated with iodoacetamide) was done using a combination of tryptic digestion and tandem mass spectrometry analysis. More than 95% of the amino acid sequence predicted from the cDNA for FucT III was confirmed by using the protein data base searching program, Sequest (data not shown). Two peptides (amino acids 152–160 and 161–189) that contain an N-linked consensus sequence were not detected. However, after treatment with PNGase F, modified (i.e. peptides with Asn converted to Asp) peptides corresponding to these sequences were detected. MS/MS analysis confirmed that the detected amino acid sequence contained Asp in place of Asn. Thus, the peptide containing amino acids 152–160 (YF(N → D)LTMSYR) gave a y7ion with m/z = 885.4 instead of 884.4 predicted for the peptide with Asn present, and the peptide containing amino acids 161–189 (SDSDIFTPYGWLEPWSGQPAHPPL(N → D)LSAK) gave a y8 ion with m/z = 840.2 instead of 839.2 predicted for the peptide with Asn present. Thus, both of the highly conserved (found in FucT III, V, and VI) N-linked glycosylation sites are glycosylated when FucT III is expressed in the yeast system. Purified FucT III was reacted with PEO-maleimide-activated biotin to label any free Cys residues (one was predicted to occur at Cys143; see Ref. 15Holmes E.H. Xu Z. Sherwood A.L. Macher B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8145-8151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), denatured and digested with trypsin under non-reducing conditions. The tryptic digest was separated by liquid chromatography and analyzed for peptides containing modified Cys residues by ESI-MS/MS. A triply charged ion (Fig. 2 A) for the Cys-containing peptide () at m/z = 1002.3 and a doubly charged ion at m/z 1503.0 were detected. The MS/MS analysis (Fig. 2 B) of the ion specie at m/z1002.3 conclusively demonstrated that Cys143 was conjugated to the biotin reagent. This is illustrated by the observed mass of the fragment ions (y12 and y13, doubly charged ion at m/z 959.6 and 1008.1, respectively) containing the biotin modified Cys residue. These ions have a mass that is 525.2 Da greater than expected if the Cys residue were unmodified; this mass corresponds to that expected for the peptide containing a modified Cys residue. Thus, the results presented in the MS/MS spectrum clearly show that Cys143 is a free Cys residue in the native protein as we previously predicted. This Cys residue is known to lie in or near the GDP-Fuc binding site (15Holmes E.H. Xu Z. Sherwood A.L. Macher B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8145-8151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). No other biotinylated Cys-containing peptides were detected, indicating that the four other highly conserved Cys residues are involved in disulfide bridges. To directly demonstrate that these Cys residues are indeed involved in disulfide bonds and determine how these Cys residues are linked, them/z values of possible disulfide-linked peptide combinations were calculated and the data generated from the LC/ESI-MS/MS analysis of a nonreduced preparation of FucT III was searched for possible matches. The search identified ions (detected as both triplym/z 1171.9 and quadruply m/z 879.1 charged species) that would result if the three Cys-containing peptides (amino acids 81–97, 330–339, and 340–343; see Fig.3 A) were eluted as a disulfide-linked, tri-peptide complex. MS/MS analysis of the quadruply charged ion at m/z 879.1 (data not shown) further supported the presence of a complex of the three Cys-containing peptides with the most abundant fragments generated by a loss of amino acids from N terminus of peptide 330–339. Low energy collision-induced dissociation resulted in a small amount of S-S bond dissociation, which was only observed at m/z 1288.3 (y12+S). Interestingly, the MS/MS spectrum of the triply charged ion for the tripeptide complex at m/z 1172.0 (see Fig.4) shows that the dominant fragment ions are generated from a preferential cleavage at the amide bond of Pro86 within the peptide containing Cys81 and Cys91. This MS/MS fragmentation pattern is consistent with previous studies of Pro-containing peptides by Loo et al.(16Loo J.A. Edmonds C.G. Smith R.D. Anal. Chem. 1993; 65: 425-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar), who observed a similar pattern with peptides derived from several proteins. The fragment ions, m/z 1750.3 (b5Y10) and 881.1 (y12Y4*), correspond to singly and doubly charged ions of disulfide-containing peptides, respectively. The ion atm/z 881.1 is predicted to result from the combination of the two peptides containing Cys91 and Cys343(peptides containing amino acids 86–97 and 340–343, respectively), and the ion at m/z 1759.1 is predicted to result from the combination of the two peptides containing Cys81 and Cys338 (peptides containing amino acids 81–85 and 330–339, respectively). These results suggest that the disulfide linkage patterns are Cys81-Cys338 and Cys91-Cys343. Two additional sets of experiments were used to verify the identity of these ion species as the tripeptide complex and to validate the assigned disulfide bond pattern. An ion trap mass spectrometer is capable of performing multiple stage MS/MS analysis to obtain structural information. MS3 analysis for the MS/MS fragment ions, m/z 881.1 and 1750.3 was employed to confirm the assignment of the Cys91-Cys343and Cys81-Cys338 disulfide bonding pattern. The dominant product ion in the MS3 spectrum of m/z881.1 (y12Y4*) is the doubly charged ion (y12Y4-H2O) due to the loss of 18 Da (water) from the precursor ion (Fig.5). All prominent ions observed, as shown in Fig. 3, can be derived from the sequence of disulfide paired peptides (86–97 and 340–343), confirming the disulfide pattern of Cys91-Cys343. The MS3 spectrum of the singly charged ion of m/z 1750.3 (b5Y10) is shown in Fig.6. As predicted, the dominant fragments are derived from the sequence of the disulfide paired peptides 81–85 and 330–339, with sequential loss of N-terminal amino acids from peptide 330–339; confirming the disulfide pattern of Cys81-Cys338.Figure 6MS3 spectrum of the singly charged ion at m/z 1750.3.

https://openalex.org/W2036328069,"Deletion of 10 evolutionarily conserved amino acids from the β subunit of Escherichia coli RNA polymerase leads to a mutant enzyme that is unable to efficiently hold onto DNA. Open promoter complexes formed by the mutant enzyme are in rapid equilibrium with closed complexes and, unlike the wild-type complexes, are highly sensitive to the DNA competitor heparin (Martin, E., Sagitov, V., Burova, E., Nikiforov, V., and Goldfarb, A. (1992)J. Biol. Chem. 267, 20175–20180). Here we show that despite this instability, the mutant enzyme forms partially open complexes at temperatures as low as 0 °C when the wild-type complex is fully closed. Thus, the two hallmarks of the open promoter complex, the stability toward a challenge with DNA competitors and the sensitivity toward low temperature, can be uncoupled by mutation and may be independent in the wild-type complex. We use the high resolution structure of Thermus aquaticus RNA polymerase core to build a functional model of promoter complex formation that accounts for the observed defects of the E. coli RNA polymerase mutants.

We use the high resolution structure of Thermus aquaticus RNA polymerase core to build a functional model of promoter complex formation that accounts for the observed defects of the E. coli RNA polymerase mutants. E. coli RNA polymerase The formation of the transcription-competent binary promoter complex by Escherichia coli RNA polymerase (RNAP)1 holoenzyme is a complex, multi-step process. Kinetic analysis using quantitative abortive initiation assays demonstrates that when RNAP first recognizes the promoter it forms the relatively unstable, “closed” complex (reviewed in Ref. 1Record Jr., M.T. Reznikoff W.S. Craig M.L. McQuade K.L. Schlax P.J. Neidhardt F.C. Escherichia coli and Salmonella, Cellular and Molecular Biology. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1996: 792-820Google Scholar). The closed complex is fully reversible: it easily dissociates back to free RNAP and DNA and is therefore highly sensitive to DNA competitors such as heparin, which bind free RNAP and prevent rebinding to promoter DNA. If RNAP commits itself to the template, the closed complex undergoes a series of poorly characterized conformational changes that lead to the formation of the transcription-competent “open” complex. Kinetic analysis at standard (37 °C) temperature indicates the existence of at least one kinetically significant, short-lived intermediate between the closed and the open complex (2Buc H. McClure W.R. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 2712-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). On most promoters the open complex formed at standard temperature is essentially irreversible and is fully resistant to DNA competitors. Direct structural analysis of closed and intermediate complexes at standard temperature is complicated since they are short-lived. In contrast, the open complex, which is the dominant species at 37 °C on most promoters, can be easily studied. DNase I footprinting of open complexes at several promoters shows extensive DNA protection from −55 to +20 relative to the transcription start point at +1. On most promoters, a hypersensitive DNase I site exists in the otherwise well protected area at about position −25 (3Ozoline O.N. Deev A.A. Arkhipova M.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 4703-4709Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). This hypersensitive site has been interpreted as the site of sharp bending in the DNA (3Ozoline O.N. Deev A.A. Arkhipova M.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 4703-4709Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Indeed, since the amount of DNA protected in the open complex exceeds the largest linear dimension of RNAP holoenzyme, DNA in the complex must be bent or curved (2Buc H. McClure W.R. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 2712-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 4Polyakov A. Severinova E. Darst S. Cell. 1995; 83: 33-41Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Probing with single strand-specific reagents such as KMnO4 demonstrates that pyrimidines between −12 to +2 are accessible in the open complex but not in the closed complex. Thus, a fragment of promoter DNA in the open complex is either severely distorted or melted (the so-called transcription bubble). On most promoters the open complex is temperature-sensitive and is rapidly and cooperatively inactivated when the reaction temperature is lowered to about 20 °C or below (5Kirkegaard K. Buc H. Spassky A. Wang J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 2544-2548Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Footprinting analysis reveals several distinct binary promoter complexes at lower temperatures (6Hofer B. Muller D. Koster H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1985; 13: 5995-6013Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 7Cowing D.W. Mecsas J. Record Jr., M.T. Gross C.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 210: 521Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 8Kovacic R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 13654-13661Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Schickor P. Metzger W. Were W. Lederer H. Heumann H. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2215-2220Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). All these additional complexes are characterized by the absence of DNA reactivity to single strand-specific reagents. In addition, the region of DNA protected by RNAP from DNase I attack is reduced at lower temperatures, mostly in the region downstream of transcription start point, and the degree of protection also varies. The dominant binary complex at 0 °C shows an alternating pattern of protection and deprotection between the positions −55 to −5, suggesting that RNAP interacts with only one side of the DNA molecule in this complex (7Cowing D.W. Mecsas J. Record Jr., M.T. Gross C.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 210: 521Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 8Kovacic R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 13654-13661Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Schickor P. Metzger W. Were W. Lederer H. Heumann H. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2215-2220Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The 0 °C binary complex is highly sensitive to DNA competitors, whereas some of the complexes obtained at higher, 10–15 °C, temperatures are relatively resistant. The mechanistic significance of binary complexes present at lower temperatures is not known. The limited number of careful kinetic and thermodynamic studies on RNAP-promoter interactions on λ PR and lac UV5 promoters suggests that binary complexes trapped at lower temperatures may correspond to transient kinetic intermediates of the open complex formation mechanism at 37 °C. Thus, the 0 °C complex may correspond to kinetically defined, heparin-sensitive closed complex, whereas other trapped complexes can correspond to various stages of isomerization from fully closed to fully open conformation. However, recent detailed analysis revealed that DNase I footprints of the 0 °C complex on the phage λ prmup-1 Δ265 promoter had both similarities to and differences from true closed complex formed at higher temperatures (10Li X.-Y. McClure W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23549-23557Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) and, thus, may be off the true promoter opening pathway. Analysis of mutant RNAPs defective in promoter complex formation provides an alternative and complementary way to trap reaction intermediates and potentially can lead to a better understanding of structure/function relationships in transcription initiation. As expected, mutational analysis indicates that the specificity subunit ς contributes to the initial promoter recognition, initiation of DNA melting, and possibly promoter complex stability (11Waldburger C. Gardella T. Wong R. Susskind M.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 576-579Crossref Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 12Juang Y.L. Helmann J.D. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8465-8473Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 13Wilson C. Dombroski A.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 267: 60-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). However, mutations in the core enzyme that affect promoter complex stability and structure have also been isolated. RNAP carrying an engineered 10-amino acid deletion in the evolutionarily conserved segment C of the β subunit, ΔRV (14Martin E. Sagitov V. Burova E. Nikiforov V. Goldfarb A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20175-20180Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was unable to efficiently hold onto promoter DNA, resulting in heparin-sensitive open complexes. More recent studies resulted in isolation of additional mutations that destabilize RNAP-promoter complexes in vitro (15Bartlett M. Gaal T. Ross W. Gourse R. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 279: 331-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). One point mutation, 4348, occurred close to ΔRV, underscoring the importance of β segment C in open complex stability. Another engineered mutation, Δ (), removed most of the β-dispensable region I, which is adjacent to segment C (Fig.1, Ref. 16Severinov K. Darst S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13481-13486Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), and resulted in RNAP that formed open promoter complexes that were more resistant to low temperature inactivation than the wild-type open complexes. The mutant complexes remained sensitive to KMnO4 attack even at −20 °C, whereas the wild-type complexes became unreactive below 15 °C, as expected (16Severinov K. Darst S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13481-13486Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the destabilizing ΔRV mutation, and the stabilizing Δ(186–433) are immediately adjacent to each other in the β subunit primary sequence. Here we reinvestigate promoter complex formation by RNAP carrying the ΔRV mutation. We confirm that ΔRV decreases open promoter complex resistance to heparin. Surprisingly, ΔRV also increases open promoter complex ability to withstand low temperature and, thus, resembles Δ(186–433). Thus, the two hallmarks of the open promoter complex, stability toward DNA competitors and sensitivity toward temperature downshift, can be uncoupled by mutation. The starting plasmid for genetic manipulations was pMKSe2 containing the wild-type rpoB gene under control of lac promoter (17Severinov K. Soushko M. Goldfarb A. Nikiforov V. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14820-14825Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The ΔRV mutation was constructed by treating pMKSe2 with EcoRV (introduces two in-frame cuts in rpoB that are 30 base pairs apart (14Martin E. Sagitov V. Burova E. Nikiforov V. Goldfarb A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20175-20180Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)) and religating the plasmid. To construct the ΩH 6mutation, two complementary oligonucleotides, 5′-p-AGGATCCATCACCACCATCACCAC-3′ (DN1) and 5′-p-GTGGTGATGGTGGTGATGGATCCT-3′ (DN2), were used. Both oligonucleotides contain BamHI recognition site (underlined). DN1 and DN2 were annealed to each other and ligated toEcoRV-digested pMKSe2 plasmid. Ligase was then inactivated by heating, and reactions were treated with a high concentration ofBamHI (does not cut pMKSe2). BamHI was inactivated by phenol extraction, and the plasmid was religated and transformed in E. coli cells. The DN1/DN2 linker when inserted in the right orientation should introduce eight amino acids, Arg-Ile-His6, in place of β amino acids removed byEcoRV. Insertion in the opposite orientation introduces several stop codons in the rpoB reading frame, so that no full-sized β′ can be produced. Recombinants containing the inserts in the right orientation were selected by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and the insertion was verified by DNA sequencing. The function of mutant rpoB genes was tested in vivousing AJ 2005 strain as described (18Kashlev M. Lee J. Zalenskaya K. Nikiforov V. Goldfarb A. Science. 1990; 248: 1006-1009Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The portion of rpoB harboring deletions was recloned from the original pMKSe2 background into pET15b-β. In this plasmid, a complete rpoB is cloned between the NdeI and BamHI sites of pET15b (Novagen). The β subunit expressed by pET15b-β or its derivatives contains an engineered N-terminal hexahistidine tag. pET15b-β and pET15b-βΔRV were transformed into XL1-blueE. coli cells, and transformants were grown in 4 liters of LB broth without the addition of isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside until late log phase. The cells were collected, and RNAP was purified by a combination of the standard purification procedure and metal ion affinity chromatography (19Kashlev M. Nudler E. Severinov K. Borukhov S. Komissarova N. Goldfarb A. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 274: 326-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), concentrated by filtration through a C-100 concentrator (Amicon) to ∼1 mg/ml, and stored in 50% glycerol storage buffer at −20 °C. RNAP from cells carrying 4337 and 4348 mutations was purified using standard procedure (4Polyakov A. Severinova E. Darst S. Cell. 1995; 83: 33-41Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (152) Google Scholar). RNAPΩH6 was prepared by in vitroreconstitution exactly as described (20Borukhov S. Goldfarb A. Protein Expression Purif. 1993; 4: 503-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Bacillus subtilis RNAP was purified from a derivative of JH642 strain that contains hexahistidine tag genetically fused to the 3′ end of the rpoC gene, coding for RNAP β′ (kindly provided by Dr. C. P. Moran, Jr.). Cells were grown at 33 °C in LB supplemented with spectinomycin (50 μg/ml) toA 600 ∼ 0.8. Cells were collected by centrifugation, resuspended in ice-cold grinding buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 0.5 m NaCl, 5% glycerol, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 2.5 mm imidazole), and disrupted by sonication. The lysate was clarified by centrifugation (12,000 × g, 15 min) and applied on a chelating Hi-Trap column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) loaded with Ni2+. The column was washed with grinding buffer containing 20 mm imidazole and then with the buffer containing 200 mm imidazole. The 200 mm imidazole fraction, which contained RNAP, was diluted 3-fold with TGE buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, 5% glycerol, 0.1 mm EDTA) and applied on a 1-ml heparin Hi-Trap column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). After washing the column with TGE buffer containing 300 mmNaCl, RNAP was eluted with TGE containing 600 mm NaCl. The purified enzyme was concentrated by dialysis against storage buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 50% glycerol) to ∼1 mg/ml and stored at −20 °C. The 106-base pair EcoRI DNA fragment containing the T7 A2 promoter (−84 to +32) was prepared as described (16Severinov K. Darst S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13481-13486Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The fragment was 32P-end-labeled by filling-in EcoRI sticky ends with Klenow enzyme in the presence of [α-32P]dATP. The fragment was then treated with AccI (cuts at position −70) to obtain top strand-labeled fragment or HincII (cuts at position +22) to obtain bottom strand-labeled fragment. Promoter complexes were formed in 20-μl reactions containing 0.4 pmol of wt or mutant RNAP, 0.2 pmol of 32P-end-labeled DNA fragment, 40 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.9, 40 mm KCl, and 10 mmMgCl2. Reactions were preincubated for 15 min at 37 °C. DNase footprinting reaction was initiated by the addition of DNase I (2 μg/ml DNase I, Worthington). The reaction proceeded for 10 s at 37 °C and was terminated by the addition of EDTA to 15 mm followed by phenol extraction and ethanol precipitation. For KMnO4 probing, promoter complexes were treated with KMnO4 (1 mm) for 15 s at 37 °C. Reactions were terminated by the addition of β-mercaptoethanol to 300 mm followed by phenol extraction, ethanol precipitation, and 10% piperidine treatment. Where indicated, reaction mixtures were challenged by the addition of 100 μg/ml heparin immediately before footprinting. To footprint promoter complexes formed at low temperatures, RNAP and32P-end-labeled T7 A2 promoter-containing fragments were combined on ice and incubated for 15 min on ice, and the footprinting reaction was performed. The same conditions were used for KMnO4 probing at low temperature, since control experiments demonstrated that KMnO4 modification was complete after 15 s. Products of footprinting reactions were analyzed by urea-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (7 m urea, 6% polyacrylamide) followed by autoradiography. Segment C is one of the nine co-linear segments of high sequence conservation found in all β subunit homologs. On the N-proximal side of segment C is dispensable region I (21Severinov K. Kashlev M. Severinova E. Bass I. McWilliams K. Kutter E. Nikiforov V. Snyder L. Goldfarb A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14254-14259Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Nudler E. Avetissova E. Markovtsev V. Goldfarb A. Science. 1996; 273: 211-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), a long region of primary sequence (E. coli residues 149–433) that is present in proteobacteria but is partially absent from homologs from other eubacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes (Fig.1). Sequence C-terminal to C is not particularly conserved and is followed by the Rif region (Ref. 17Severinov K. Soushko M. Goldfarb A. Nikiforov V. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14820-14825Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar and residues 505–574, Fig. 1). Mutations at or close to segment C used in this study are shown on Fig.1. ΔRV removes amino acids 436–445 at the left side of segment C (14Martin E. Sagitov V. Burova E. Nikiforov V. Goldfarb A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20175-20180Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The region affected by the deletion contains several highly conserved amino acids and has sequence similarity with barnase-type bacterial RNases. Δ(186–433) is a long deletion in dispensable region I and is immediately adjacent to ΔRV (21Severinov K. Kashlev M. Severinova E. Bass I. McWilliams K. Kutter E. Nikiforov V. Snyder L. Goldfarb A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14254-14259Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 4348, selected for the ability to confer prototrophy on relA spoT strains occurred close to ΔRV, changing conserved Arg454 to His (15Bartlett M. Gaal T. Ross W. Gourse R. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 279: 331-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). ΩH6 is a new mutation. It was constructed by site-specific mutagenesis and introduces eight unnatural amino acids, Arg-Ile-His6, in place of segment C amino acids removed by ΔRV (see “Materials and Methods”). The in vivo phenotype of ΩH 6 was tested in the E. coli AJ2005 tester strain (18Kashlev M. Lee J. Zalenskaya K. Nikiforov V. Goldfarb A. Science. 1990; 248: 1006-1009Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). AJ2005 cells have an amber mutation in the chromosomal copy of rpoBthat is suppressed by the supU suppresser carried by an F-factor. The F-factor also carries the lacZ gene, and AJ2005 cells are therefore Lac+. When a plasmid bearing a functional rpoB allele is introduced into AJ2005, the F-factor can be lost, and the plasmid-borne rpoB gene becomes the only source of the β subunit in the cell. As a result, such cells, become Lac−, and they can be easily distinguished from parental cells using indicator media. AJ2005 cells transformed with the rpoB expression plasmid pMKSe2 bearingrpoB+ or ΩH 6 segregated Lac− colonies (data not shown). In contrast, no Lac− colonies was observed when AJ2005 was transformed with pMKSe2 bearing ΔRV (data not shown, Ref. 14Martin E. Sagitov V. Burova E. Nikiforov V. Goldfarb A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20175-20180Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This result suggests that the insertion functionally compensates for defects caused by ΔRV and that the total length of this part of segment C is more important for function than the sequence per se. To better understand the marked differences in promoter complex stability caused by the two adjacent mutations in the β subunit, ΔRV and Δ(186–433), promoter complexes formed by RNAPΔRV, RNAPΔ(186–433), and RNAPWT were studied by DNase I footprinting (Fig. 2). RNAPΩH6 was also included in this analysis. The DNase I footprint of the RNAPWT on the A2 promoter of bacteriophage T7 was typical for open complexes on ς70promoters. Upstream of the transcription start site, protection started at around position −40, followed by a region of hypersensitivity at around position −25. The −10 promoter region was completely protected from DNase I attack, and this protection extended through the transcription start site to about position +20 (Fig. 2 A,lane 5). As described previously (16Severinov K. Darst S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13481-13486Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), RNAPΔ(186–433) produced an identical footprint upstream of the transcription start site; however, position +1 was only partially protected, and there was no protection beyond position +5 (Fig. 2 A, lane 4). The RNAPΔRV footprint was also shortened in the downstream direction and, thus, was qualitatively similar to RNAPΔ(186–433) footprint. Unlike RNAPΔ(186–433), RNAPΔRV failed to protect the promoter DNA fully, suggesting that significant portion of the enzyme dissociated from the promoter during the 15-s treatment with DNase (note that in this experiment we used 10 times as much RNAPΔRV as other enzymes). This result agrees well with the previous findings obtained by filter binding and quantitative abortive initiation assays (14Martin E. Sagitov V. Burova E. Nikiforov V. Goldfarb A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20175-20180Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Kinetic analysis indicated that even at very high RNAPΔRVconcentrations the steady-state level of mutant promoter complexes was 30% that of the wild type (14Martin E. Sagitov V. Burova E. Nikiforov V. Goldfarb A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20175-20180Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, RNAPΩH6 footprint was indistinguishable from the wild-type footprint; it was fully extended; and protection of DNA was complete (lane 3), in agreement with the results of thein vivo phenotypic analysis (above). The DNA strand separation in open complexes formed by the wild-type and mutant RNAPs was investigated using KMnO4 probing. The wild-type and the ΩH6 complexes appeared the same, with thymines at −15, −12, −11, −9, −7, −5, −4, and −3, as well as cytosine at −14 being modified by KMnO4 (Fig.2 B, lanes 3 and 5). As described elsewhere (16Severinov K. Darst S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13481-13486Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), the single-stranded region did not extend as far downstream in complexes formed by RNAPΔ(186–433); only thymines at positions −15, −12, −11, and −9 and cytosine at −14 were modified by KMnO4 (Fig. 2 B, lane 4). As expected, probing of RNAPΔRV complex revealed similar shortening of the transcription bubble (Fig. 2 B, lane 2). The results of the footprinting experiment suggest that in RNAPΔRV-T7 A2 promoter complexes, protein-DNA contacts in the downstream region are lost, and DNA melting does not extend beyond the −5 position relative to transcription start. RNAPΔ(186–433) also forms such shortened complexes, which are heparin-resistant and remain sensitive to permanganate at temperatures as low as −20 °C (16Severinov K. Darst S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13481-13486Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In contrast, the wild-type complexes close at around 15 °C on this promoter (16Severinov K. Darst S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13481-13486Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Since at 37 °C RNAPΔRV and RNAPΔ(186–433) promoter looked similar, we tested if RNAPΔRV complexes also remain sensitive to permanganate at lower temperatures. Fig.3 demonstrates that this was indeed the case. In this experiment, RNAP and radioactively labeled promoter fragment were combined at either 37 or 0 °C and incubated for 15 min to allow the complex formation, and KMnO4 probing was performed. As can be seen, there was no modification of thymines in the wild-type complex at 0 °C (lane 3), indicating that the complex was closed, as expected. In contrast, in the ΔRV complex thymines in the upstream portion of the transcription bubble remained sensitive to permanganate attack even at low temperature (lane 5). Assuming 100% opening at 37 °C, more than 50% of the mutant complex was open at low temperature, similar to the value previously obtained for RNAPΔ(186–433)(16Severinov K. Darst S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13481-13486Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Recently, an rpoB4348 point mutation that changes evolutionarily conserved segment C Arg454 to His and that renders RNAP-promoter complexes sensitive to heparin attack was described (15Bartlett M. Gaal T. Ross W. Gourse R. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 279: 331-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). To find out whether unstable open complexes are generally more resistant to low temperature, we purified the RNAP carrying the 4348 mutation, formed promoter complexes at 37 and 0 °C, and probed them with KMnO4. The Arg → His substitution caused by the 4348 mutation is only 10 amino acids away of the ΔRV deletion (Fig. 1), and we therefore expected that it destabilizes the complex through a similar mechanism. This expectation was not fulfilled. As can be seen, at 37 °C the mutant enzyme produced a fully open “wild-type” complex, which was highly sensitive to heparin attack (Fig.4 A, lane 6). When probing was performed at 0 °C, no sensitive thymines were observed, indicating that the mutant enzyme was unable to melt promoter DNA at these conditions (Fig. 4 A, lane 7). Additional experiments established that RNAPΩH6complexes were indistinguishable from the wild-type complexes,i.e. they were heparin-resistant at high temperature and closed at low temperature (data not shown). It was previously suggested that heparin may actively displace RNAP from promoter complex instead of simply acting as a trap for free RNAP. The experiment presented on Fig. 4 was repeated with poly[dA-dT] as a competitor, and the same result was obtained (data not shown). In Gram-positive bacteria, the region on the N-terminal side of segment C contains insertions and deletions relative to the E. coli sequence (Fig. 1). It is conceivable that compared with the E. coli enzyme, insertions/deletions in these organisms change the position of segment C with respect to other RNAP functional sites. In agreement with this idea it was reported that RNAP from B. subtilis, which contains a long, 90-amino acid insertion relative to E. coliclose to segment C (Fig. 1), as well several deletions closer to the N-terminal segment B, forms open promoter complexes that are highly sensitive to heparin (25Whipple F.W. Sonenshein A.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 223: 399-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Moreover, DNase I footprinting established that promoter complexes formed by B. subtilis enzyme were shortened in the downstream region as compared with E. coliRNAP complexes (25Whipple F.W. Sonenshein A.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 223: 399-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). We purified B. subtilis RNAP and investigated the T7 A2 promoter complexes formed by this enzyme using KMnO4 footprinting. Purified B. subtilis RNAP recognized the T7 A2 promoter with low efficiency, and high amounts of the enzyme were necessary to observe promoter complex formation. In agreement with the published data, B. subtilis complexes were sensitive to heparin (Fig. 4 B, lane 5). Importantly, the pattern of KMnO4 sensitivity in the transcription bubble in 37 °C complexes formed by B. subtilis RNAP was shortened in the downstream direction as compared with the E. coli RNAP complexes and was highly similar or identical to RNAPΔ(186–433) and RNAPΔRV complexes (Fig. 4 B,right). However, at 0 °C the KMnO4sensitivity in B. subtilis complex disappeared (Fig.4 B, lane 6). We are currently performing deletion mutagenesis in cloned B. subtilis rpoB gene to see if deletions in the B. subtilis β subunit β-dispensable region I can result in temperature resistance. Open promoter complexes formed by E. coli RNAP at the physiological temperature of 37 °C are highly resistant to polyanion heparin, which acts as a DNA competitor. When the reaction temperature is lowered to about 15 °C, heparin-sensitive promoter complexes are formed (23Craig M.L. Tsodikov O.V. McQuade K.L. Schlax Jr., P.E. Capp M.W. Saecker R.M. Record Jr., M.T. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 283: 741-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Thus, it appeared that heparin resistance of promoter complexes and the ability to partially melt promoter DNA are related to each other. One would expect then that mutations that render open complexes heparin-sensitive will also make them more sensitive to lower temperatures. Obviously, RNAP with a short deletion in the β-conserved segment C studied here, RNAPΔRV, does not meet this expectation; at 37 °C the mutant complexes are as sensitive to heparin as closed complexes (14Martin E. Sagitov V. Burova E. Nikiforov V. Goldfarb A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20175-20180Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), yet they remain partially open at 0 °C, when the wild-type complexes are fully closed. Thus, the two hallmarks of transcription-competent open promoter complex, resistance to inactivation by heparin and sensitivity to low temperature, can be uncoupled. Consequently, RNAP structural elements that underlie the localized melting of promoter DNA and ability to resist heparin challenge must also be distinct. A seminal paper by Zhang et al. (26Zhang G. Campbell L. Minakhin L. Richter C. Severinov K. Darst S.A. Cell. 1999; 98: 811-824Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar) reveals the structure of core RNAP from thermophilic bacterium Thermus aquaticus(Taq) at 3.3 Å resolution. The Taq molecule has a characteristic crab claw-like shape, with a deep, ∼27-Å-wide channel separating the jaws of the claw. The catalytic Mg2+ion is located deep in the middle of the channel that likely binds the template DNA. The area of the 27-Å channel that is to the left of catalytic Mg2+ in the representation of Fig.5 B is thought to contact the downstream, double-stranded DNA; the area to the right makes contacts with transcription bubble, DNA-RNA heteroduplex, and upstream DNA. The upper RNAP jaw is composed mostly of β and is bilobate; the downstream lobe is composed entirely of β-dispensable region I and portions of conserved segment C; the second, upstream lobe is composed of the remainder of conserved segment C and segment D. The region ofTaq β that corresponds to E. coli positions 186–433 is shown in orange in Fig. 5; Taq amino acids corresponding to those removed by ΔRV are shown inred. As can be seen, Δ(186–433) entirely removes the downstream lobe, whereas ΔRV removes amino acids at the outside (downstream) edge of this lobe. We propose that the bilobed structure of the top RNAP jaw holds the key to the understanding of biochemical phenotypes of the mutant enzymes studied here. We envision that both lobes make interactions with promoter DNA and that these interactions occur in a concerted, interdependent manner. The upstream lobe cooperates with the ς subunit (binds to the coiled-coil structure of β′ located immediately below (Ref. 27Arthur T.M. Burgess R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31381-31387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, Fig. 5 C)) and maintains the initial strand separation at the upstream edge of the transcription bubble. We propose that these upstream protein-DNA interactions are temperature-insensitive and that locking of the upstream jaw also engages, via an allosteric mechanism, the downstream lobe, which results in extended footprint and propagation of melting in the downstream direction. The allosteric mechanism that controls the movement of both lobes is organized such that only two conformations are stable; both lobes are unlocked (i.e. closed complex) or both lobes are locked (open complex). We propose that the locking of the downstream lobe is temperature-sensitive. The Δ(186–433) mutation removes the downstream lobe; ΔRV leaves it intact but destroys the allosteric mechanism. As a result, promoter complexes formed by mutant enzymes are held together by upstream lobe-promoter DNA interactions; they are shortened in the downstream direction, are partially melted, and are temperature-resistant. In the wild-type E. coli RNAP complex or in the Δ(186–433) complex the upstream interactions are both temperature-resistant and heparin-resistant. However, mutations such as R454H (shown in cyan and space-fill on Fig. 5), which occurred in the cleft between the two lobes, can induce heparin sensitivity. E. coli RNAP with lesions at β positions 531, 532, and 563 form heparin-sensitive complexes (28Zhou Y.N. Jin D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2908-2913Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). In Taq, the corresponding positions (shown in magenta and space-fill on Fig. 5) are also located between the two lobes, behind the amino acid corresponding to E. coli Arg454. Mutational changes in these positions probably weaken DNA contacts made by the upstream lobe and, thus, make the complex sensitive to competitor. The ΔRV deletion occurred immediately adjacent to the linker, which connects the two β lobes (shown in cyan andribbons on Fig. 5). Thus, ΔRV probably affects the DNA interactions of both lobes, which explains its heparin sensitivity and temperature resistance. In the presence of NTPs the ΔRV and Δ(186–433) complexes appear indistinguishable from the wild-type enzyme complexes but different from the extended wild-type complex formed in the absence of NTP (14Martin E. Sagitov V. Burova E. Nikiforov V. Goldfarb A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20175-20180Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Severinov K. Darst S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13481-13486Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Thus, other RNAP segments, most likely in β′, must participate in these additional interactions with downstream DNA. Our “two stroke” model of promoter opening is supported by data of Guo and Gralla (24Guo Y. Gralla Y.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11655-11660Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), who studied the interaction of RNAP holoenzyme with artificial DNA templates containing structures mimicking the upstream end of the transcription bubble. Consistent with our model, RNAP complexes formed with these structures are heparin-resistant and temperature-insensitive. Mustaev and co-workers (29Korzheva, N., Mustaev, A., Malhotra, A., Nikiforov, V., Goldfarb, A., and Darst, S. A. (2000) Science, in pressGoogle Scholar) used extensive protein-DNA cross-linking to build a more detailed model of elongation complex using structural information from Taq RNAP core enzyme. In agreement with our model, the authors found that large scale movements of β lobes toward the DNA are necessary to achieve tight complementary fit between the DNA and the roof of the main RNAP channel. Curiously, no partially melted complexes were detected when wild-typeE. coli RNAP complexes trapped at lower temperatures were analyzed (5Kirkegaard K. Buc H. Spassky A. Wang J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 2544-2548Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 6Hofer B. Muller D. Koster H.

Thus, the results obtained with mutant enzymes may complement the existing data obtained by temperature trapping. Real time structural, kinetic, and thermodynamic analyses of promoter complex formation by the wild-type RNAP as a function of conditions will be needed to characterize true intermediates of promoter opening and to compare them to complexes obtained using mutant enzymes and temperature trapping.

The Human T-cell Leukemia Virus Type I (HTLV-I) is the etiological agent of Adult T-cell Leukemia/Lymphoma (ATLL). A previous report suggested that Tax, the viral transactivator, is able to suppress the transactivation potential of c-Myb protein by competing for recruitment of CBP. We tested whether such a competition could affect transcription from the c-Myb promoter in Tax expressing T-cells. Using several c-Myb promoter reporter constructs carrying mutations in various regions, we demonstrate that Tax suppression of c-Myb transactivation results in transrepression of the c-Myb promoter through the Myb responsive elements in Jurkat T-cells. The ability of Tax mutants M22, M47 and V89A to interact with the full-length CBP and p300 proteins in vitro, and their ability to repress the c-Myb promoter, was then evaluated. Although both M47 and M22 bind to CBP and p300 to a similar extent, only M47 was able to repress the c-Myb promoter, suggesting that competition for CBP/p300 binding was not the mechanism underlying Tax's effect. This concept was further supported by the fact that the Tax mutant V89A transrepresses the c-Myb promoter efficiently in spite of an impaired binding to CBP and p300. Therefore, Tax-mediated repression of the c-Myb promoter appears to be independent from a direct competition between c-Myb and Tax for recruitment of CBP/p300. Interestingly, a decreased transcription from the endogenous c-Myb promoter was observed in several HTLV-I transformed T-cell lines. Finally, the ability of Tax to directly repress the endogenous c-Myb promoter was demonstrated in a Jurkat cell line stably transfected with a tax gene driven by a cadmium-inducible promoter."

We created mutants of IFN-γ that bind only one IFN-γR1 chain per dimer molecule (called a monovalent IFN-γ) to see if the interaction of IFN-γ with one-half of the receptor complex is sufficient for bioactivity. Mutating a receptor-binding sequence in either AB loop of a covalent dimer of IFN-γ yielded two monovalent IFN-γs, γm-γ and γ-γm, which cross-link to only a single soluble IFN-γR1 molecule in solution and on the cell surface. Monovalent IFN-γ competes fully with wild type IFN-γ for binding to U937 cells but only at a greater than 100-fold higher concentration than wild type IFN-γ. Monovalent IFN-γ had anti-vesicular stomatitis virus activity and antiproliferative activity, and it induced major histocompatibility complex class I and class II (HLA-DR) expression. In contrast, the maximal levels of activated Stat1α produced by monovalent IFN-γs after 15 min were never more than half of those produced by either wild type or covalent IFN-γs in human cell lines. These data indicate that while monovalent IFN-γ activates only one-half of a four-chain receptor complex, this is sufficient for Stat1α activation, major histocompatibility complex class I surface antigen induction, and antiviral and antiproliferative activities. Thus, while interaction with both halves of the receptor complex is required for high affinity binding of IFN-γ and efficient signal transduction, interaction with only one-half of the receptor complex is sufficient to initiate signal transduction."

At least one of the SERCA gene products is expressed in every mammalian tissue studied, emphasizing the fundamental role of this protein in cellular function. Products of the SERCA1 gene are the predominant isoforms expressed in skeletal muscle (SERCA1a adult, SERCA1b neonatal) (4Brandl C.J. deLeon S. Martin D.R. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol.

SERCA expression is much higher in striated muscle than in smooth muscle or non-muscle to accommodate the large calcium fluxes associated with excitation-contraction coupling.Contractile activity has a marked effect on SERCA expression in striated muscle. Increased contractile activity leads to decreases in SERCA1 and SERCA2a expression in skeletal (13Kandarian S.C. Peters D.G. Taylor J.A. Williams G.A. Am. J.

SERCA1 expression is particularly sensitive to the reduction of contractile activity due to rat soleus muscle unloading, with significant increases by 2 days and 7-fold increases by 7 days (19Peters D.G. Mitchell-Felton H. Kandarian S.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: C1218-C1225Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, the increase in expression is due to increases in SERCA1 gene transcription (19Peters D.G. Mitchell-Felton H. Kandarian S.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: C1218-C1225Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The up-regulation of SERCA1 with unloading is counterintuitive as it occurs in a background of overall decreases in total protein and mRNA synthesis (20Thomason D.B. Booth F.W. J. Appl. Physiol. 1990; 68: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). This suggests that the up-regulation of SERCA1 is an active and highly regulated process. However, the functional significance and the molecular mechanisms of selective gene activation are unknown.In previous work we isolated the rat 5′ flank and promoter region of SERCA1 to −3636 base pairs (21Mitchell-Felton H. Kandarian S.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: C1269-C1276Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As a first step in elucidating the transcriptional regulation of SERCA1 by unloading, the sequence from −3636 to +172 was examined using in vivo somatic gene transfer to identify the region(s) both necessary and sufficient for weight-bearing sensitivity. Comprehensive promoter analysis revealed two regions of SERCA1 that were sufficient to confer unloading responsiveness and which were necessary for the unloading sensitivity of the −3636 to +172 construct. Mutagenesis and further deletion analysis of these regions identified a CACC box/E-box interaction, which was required for transcriptional activation with unloading. This is the first demonstration of specific cis-elements required for the in vivo regulation of a Ca2+ handling gene by changes in muscle loading activity.RESULTSPrevious work in this laboratory showed that 75 μg was an optimal amount of SERCA1 plasmid to inject in soleus muscles with respect to the efficiency of plasmid uptake and luciferase activity (21Mitchell-Felton H. Kandarian S.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: C1269-C1276Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Southern blot analysis revealed that neither the size of the constructs (Ref. 21Mitchell-Felton H. Kandarian S.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: C1269-C1276Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and data not shown) nor the intervention of hind limb unloading altered plasmid uptake in soleus muscles (control = 378 ± 40 densitometric absorbance units, n = 108; unloaded = 440 ± 47 absorbance units, n = 109; p = 0.32). To determine whether different amounts of injected DNA affected the extent of transactivation with muscle unloading, 50, 75, or 125 μg of SERCA1 (−3636)-pGL3 was examined. Luciferase activity of SERCA1 (−3636)-pGL3 normalized to plasmid uptake was increased 7-fold after 7 days of unloading (Fig.1). Since the extent of increase in luciferase activity was similar at the different quantities tested, the amount of DNA injected did not influence the magnitude of the unloading response. The increase in luciferase activity was the same as the unloading-induced activation of the endogenous SERCA1 gene (19Peters D.G. Mitchell-Felton H. Kandarian S.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: C1218-C1225Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that elements sufficient for unloading sensitivity were contained in this construct.Initial in vivo deletion analysis of the SERCA1 5′ flank was performed with the constructs depicted in Fig.2. In control muscles, expression of the SERCA1-pGL3 reporter constructs decreased with serial deletions. Unloading responsiveness (i.e. fold activation) was evident in all constructs except SERCA1 (−3174)-pGL3, SERCA1 (−2874)-pGL3, SERCA1 (−1158)-pGL3, SERCA1 (−962)-pGL3, SERCA1 (−612)-pGL3, and SERCA1 (−103)-pGL3. The most obvious loss of unloading responsiveness occurred upon deletion of the region between −1373 and −1158. Therefore, this region was of interest and was selected for further study. Unloading responsiveness was not observed with the deletion of DNA between −1158 and −612. However, injection of the SERCA1 (−330)-pGL3 construct resulted in a return of the unloading response, which was lost again with injection of SERCA1 (−103)-pGL3. The return of unloading responsiveness was unexpected, so the SERCA1 (−330)-pGL3 injection was repeated with newly amplified DNA and a different set of muscles. The same unloading response was observed in the second experiment. Thus, the sequence between −330 and +172 was sufficient in isolation to confer unloading responsiveness, so it was a second region designated for further study. We also observed loss of unloading responsiveness in SERCA1 (−3174)-pGL3 and SERCA1 (−2874)-pGL3 compared with SERCA1 (−3636)-pGL3, although the decrease in fold activation was due to increased control values as opposed to decreased unloading values. These regions were also tested further. Taken together these data suggest that there are multiple regions in the SERCA1 promoter-enhancer that can confer unloading responsiveness. The intricacy of the unloading response in this figure is likely due to the comprehensiveness of the promoter analysis as well as the complexity of the in vivo physiological phenomena under study.Figure 2In vivo deletion analysis of the rat SERCA1 5′ flank. A construct containing the SERCA1 sequence from the indicated nucleotide to +172 upstream of a luciferase reporter gene (Luc) was injected into soleus muscles (75 μg/muscle). Luciferase activity was determined for control (black bars) and 7-day-unloaded (gray bars) muscles. Fold activation is the unloaded divided by the control value. Plasmid uptake was measured in all muscles by Southern blot analysis, which showed no difference in uptake by unloading or plasmid size. For internal consistency, luciferase activity is reported. n = 8–16 muscles per group.

The activation of SERCA1 (−962 to −612)-SV40 was unexpected since neither SERCA1 (−962)-pGL3 nor SERCA1 (−612)-pGL3 showed unloading responsiveness (Fig. 2). This finding emphasized the context specificity of the promoter analysis. Other fragments of the SERCA1 5′ flank showed either modest increases or no change in luciferase activity when examined in isolation. Next, we sought to determine whether the regions that were sufficient for unloading responsiveness were required in the context of SERCA1 (−3636)-pGL3. To do this, inverse PCR was used to delete a specific region from the −3636 to +172 parent construct, thereby creating internal deletion constructs (Fig. 3 B). Removal of sequence between −1403 and −1158 abolished the unloading response, indicating that this region is required for unloading induced transcriptional activation. Deletion of other sequences did not result in a loss of unloading sensitivity. These data reveal that one obvious region of the SERCA1 5′ flank containing elements both necessary and sufficient for unloading responsiveness was between −1373 and −1158. The other observation made from this experiment was that sequences involved in high level expression and unloading sensitivity are distinct and, furthermore, that the sequence required for high level expression is not confined to the 5′ end of the construct (Fig. 3 B). Data from Fig. 3,A and B were re-plotted as fold activation for comparative purposes, since heterologous and wild type promoters were used to help visualize that −1373 to −1158 was both necessary and sufficient for transcriptional activation with 7 days of muscle unloading (Fig. 3 C).Figure 3Identification of regions of the SERCA1 5′ flank both necessary and sufficient for unloading sensitivity. A, a fragment of the SERCA1 5′ flank (black box) was ligated upstream of the heterologous SV40 promoter to test each fragment for sufficiency of unloading. B, the indicated regions of the SERCA1 5′ flank were removed from the SERCA1 (−3636)-pGL3 parent construct to test their necessity for unloading sensitivity in the context of SERCA1 (−3636)-pGL3. The lack of an exact match between the removed nucleotides in B and their corresponding fragment in A is because the PCR primers used to create deletion constructs had stringent criteria that could not always be met. Control (black bars) and 7-day-unloaded (gray bars) values are as plotted. C, data fromA and B re-plotted as fold activation to emphasize that the region between −1373 and −1158 is both necessary and sufficient for the unloading response.

Thus, sequence between −1314 and −1248 is involved in unloading sensitivity (Fig. 4). However, the sequence from −1373 to −1248 was not sufficient, in isolation, to up-regulate activity, suggesting that an interaction between −1314 to −1248 and −1248 to −1158 exists that confers unloading responsiveness. This interaction may involve the E-box at −1248, which is deleted in the constructs showing only a 2-fold activation. Thus, the E-box (−1248) may be necessary for weight-bearing responsiveness.Figure 4Deletion analysis of the SERCA1 region from −1373 to −1158. The cis-elements present in each construct are as indicated. The E-boxes at −1314 and −1248 were disrupted in the creation of the different deletion constructs.

Consensus cis-elements were identified using MatInspector (Version 2.2). Mutation of the CACC box at position −1262 abolished the unloading response, indicating that this CACC site is involved in the up-regulation of SERCA1 (−1373 to −1158)-SV40. Disruption of the NFAT (−1367) and CACC (−1272) sites did not change transcriptional activation, whereas mutation of CACC (−1305) and CCAAT (−1287) sites show moderate decreases in the unloading response. Surprisingly, with the exception of the E-box at −1248, mutation of the known elements between −1248 and −1158, the NF-I (−1198) and Sp1 (−1171) sites, did not decrease the unloading response. Since an interaction was predicted from the results of Fig.4, we explored the possibility that the E-box (−1248) is interacting with the CACC (−1262) site.Figure 5Mutagenesis of cis-elements in SERCA1 between −1373 and −1158. Individual cis-elements were mutated as indicated (for mutated bases see Table I). Constructs were injected into control (black bars) or 7-day-unloaded (gray bars) soleus muscles.

Since weight-bearing sensitivity was abolished with the mutation of the CACC box at −1262, the first step was to examine this cis-element. Injection of SERCA1 (CACC)-SV40, a trimerized construct containing the CACC (−1262) site, resulted in no significant change in luciferase activity, supporting the hypothesis that an interaction of CACC (−1262) with a second cis-element is required for transcriptional up-regulation. Examination of SERCA1 (CACC/E-box)-SV40, containing CACC (−1262) and E-box (−1248), resulted in a 9.0-fold increase over control values. Thus, the combination of CACC (−1262) and E-box (−1248) is sufficient to transduce an unloading response, suggesting communication between trans-factors binding these elements. A multimerized construct containing CACC (−1272), CACC (−1262), and E-box (−1248) had a 4.6-fold increase in luciferase activity with unloading. However, the decrease in fold activation was due to a greater increase in the control versus the unloaded luciferase activity, suggesting that the CACC box at −1272 may be important for general high level transcription of SERCA1. This is consistent with the overall decrease in luciferase activity in both control and unloaded muscles with mutagenesis of the CACC box at −1272 base pairs (Fig. 5).Figure 6Identification of cis-elements sufficient for transactivation with 7 days of unloading. Constructs were made which contain trimerized CACC sites and E-boxes (as indicated, see Table II for sequence) and injected into control (black bars) and unloaded (gray bars) soleus muscles. Fold activation is the unloaded divided by the control value.n = 8 muscles/group. Data are the means ± S.E.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The sequence between −330 to +172 was further examined because 1) SERCA1 (−330)-pGL3 shows a 9.3-fold increase with unloading, 2) the sequence is in close proximity to the basal promoter, and 3) the sequence contains multiple CACC and E-boxes, which were found to be important in −1373 to −1158. Further interest in the −330 region was spurred by the finding that SERCA1 (−3636 to −330)-SV40 could not activate transcription with unloading (Fig.7), suggesting that the SERCA1 (−3636)-pGL3 construct requires the sequence from −330 to +172 for transactivation. Since the sequence between −330 and −103 was not necessary for unloading responsiveness (Figs. 3 B and 7), it was particularly interesting to find that luciferase activity was increased in SERCA1 (−3636 to −103)-SV40 with unloading. In addition, SERCA1 (−330 to −103)-SV40 (Figs. 3 A and 7) and SERCA1 (−103)-pGL3 (Figs. 2 and 7) were not sufficient to activate transcription, whereas SERCA1 (−330)-pGL3 was sufficient (Figs. 2 and7). The results indicate that sequence between −330 and +172 was required for the unloading response seen with SERCA1 (−3636)-pGL3, but that required elements were found in both −330 to −103 and −103 to +172, regions that contain both CACC sites and E-boxes in high numbers. To delineate the minimal required sequence for activation, further deletion analysis was performed. SERCA1 (−330 to +27)-pGL3 was sufficient to up-regulate transcription, whereas SERCA1 (−330 to −21)-SV40 was not, suggesting that the sequence from −21 to +27 contributes to transducing the unloading signal. It is of interest that the spacing of the E-box and CACC site between −21 and +27 is similar to the CACC site and E-box in −1373 to −1158. Given the density of CACC and E-boxes in −330 to +172, the necessity of this sequence for unloading sensitivity of SERCA1 (−3636)-pGL3, and the requirement for the sequence between −21 and +27, which contains a CACC site and an E-box, it is likely that these elements are critical to transducing transactivation in response to the removal of weight-bearing in the soleus muscle.Figure 7Examination of the region between −330 and +172 for elements involved in unloading responsiveness. The position of both CACC sites and E-boxes between −330 and +172 are indicated. Data are presented as fold activation, since both wild type and heterologous (SV40) promoters were used.

Bootman M.D. Lipp P. Nature. 1998; 395: 645-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (1755) Google Scholar). SERCA1, by translocating Ca2+ from the cytosol to the lumen of the sarcoplasmic reticulum, is a critical protein in the regulation of skeletal muscle Ca2+ homeostasis. The SERCA1 gene is highly mutable, with mRNA expression and transcription being up-regulated 7-fold by 7 days of unloading in rat soleus muscles (19Peters D.G. Mitchell-Felton H. Kandarian S.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: C1218-C1225Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Given the central role that SERCA1 plays in maintaining Ca2+homeostasis, it is surprising how little is known about the transcriptional regulation of the gene. Thus, the focus of the present study was to identify elements involved in the transcriptional activation of the SERCA1 gene by muscle inactivity due to unloading. We found that there were specific CACC sites and E-boxes that were required for unloading-induced transactivation.The rat SERCA1 5′ flank contains cis-elements between −3636 and +172 that are known to be important in regulating muscle-specific genes. These include 21 CACC sites (CACCC), 17 myogenic E-boxes (CAGNTG), 2 M-CAT sites (GGAATG), 4 NFAT sites (WGGAAANH), 1 Sp1 site (GGGCGG), 10 Sp1-like sites (GGGAGG), and 12 TRE half-sites (RGGTSA). Interestingly there are no MEF2 sites (YTAWWWWTAR), MEF3 sites (SSTCAGGTTWC), or CArG boxes (CCWWWWWWGG) previously shown to be important for transcription of some muscle genes (22Muscat G.E.

Given the relatively high number of CACC sites and E-boxes, it is not surprising that these two elements were found to be necessary for transcriptional regulation of the SERCA1 gene with unloading.

In the course of examining the effect of trypsin on this preparation, it was observed that soluble polypeptides were released by the action of the protease in sufficient amounts for them to be detected by conventional staining of SDS gels with Coomassie Blue. Sequencing of these tryptic fragments showed that they were not derived from the Ca-ATPase but instead possessed N termini identifying them as overlapping stretches of polypeptide originating in the large cytoplasmic domain (f loop) of a Na+-Ca2+exchanger. Because this region of the Na+-Ca2+exchanger is crucial for its regulation through physiological mechanisms and because it may represent a possible target for pharmacological intervention, the polypeptides were further investigated.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESDeep sea scallops (Placopecten magellanicus) were obtained from the Marine Biology Laboratory (Woods Hole, MA).Preparation of Native Membranes Enriched in Fragmented Sarcoplasmic ReticulumThis was carried out essentially as described previously (25Kalabokis V.

Chem. 1988; 263: 15184-15188Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Preparation of Soluble Fragments from Tryptic DigestsMembranes were typically suspended at 5–10 mg ml−1 in standard media of 20% (v/v) ethylene glycol (Pierce), 0.15 m KCl, 1 mmCaCl2 or 10 mm EGTA-Na, 50 mm MOPS-Na, pH 7.0. Digestions were at room temperature for 10–15 min. with N-tosyl-l-phenylalanyl chloromethyl ketone-treated trypsin (Sigma, dissolved in 1 mm HCl at 12,000 units/mg) added in a 1:30 (w/w) ratio to total membrane protein (giving 400 units of activity/mg total membrane protein). Digestions were terminated by addition of 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride (Calbiochem) to a final concentration of 20 mm, followed by transfer of the sample to ice. The samples were centrifuged at 16,000 × g for ½ h at 4 °C in an Eppendorf microcentrifuge. The supernatant was collected and recentrifuged for 1 h at 105 × g in a Beckman TL100 bench top ultracentrifuge at 4 °C to remove traces of contaminating membranes.Concentration of Soluble Peptides for Use in SDS-PAGESodium deoxycholate was added to the high speed supernatant from the tryptic digest to a final concentration of 0.025% (w/v), followed by trichloroacetic acid to a final concentration of 6% (w/v). The trichloroacetic acid also served to completely inactivate the trypsin. After incubation on ice for 15 min, the preparation was centrifuged at 16,000 × g for ½ h, the supernatant was carefully removed, and the pellet was washed with 200 μl of diethyl ether. After drying, the pellet was dissolved in Tricine or Laemmli sample denaturation buffer.Gel ElectrophoresisDiscontinuous SDS-PAGE was carried out with glycine or Tricine as the trailing anion (31Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205881) Google Scholar, 32Schägger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10429) Google Scholar). Sodium thioglycholate (0.1 mm) was present in the sample denaturation medium and added to the cathode buffer to scavenge the gel ahead of the peptides for free radicals and oxidants.N-terminal SequencingThe proteolytic fragments were separated by SDS-PAGE, and the gels were electroblotted onto Immobilon-PSQ polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore) in a medium of 10% (v/v) MeOH, 10 mm CAPS-Na, pH 11 at 4 °C. After lightly staining with Coomassie Blue, the bands of interest were cut out and sent to the Protein Chemistry Core of the University of Florida.Phosphorylation of the Membranes with Protein Kinase AThe DOC-extracted B2 membrane fraction (1 mg) was incubated with 50 units of the catalytic subunit of PKA in a medium of 0.27m sucrose, 80 mm KCl, 5 mm EGTA, 0.08 mm CaCl2, 29 mm NaF, 8.3 mm MgCl2, 20 mm MOPS-Na, pH 7.0 containing 0.1 mm [γ-32P]ATP (500 dpm pmol−1) for 2 min at 30 °C. The membranes were sedimented at 16,000 × g and washed free of unbound radioactivity. The phosphorylated membranes were then divided into two parts, one of which was resuspended in 20% (v/v) ethylene glycol, 0.4m KCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 50 mm MOPS-Na, pH 7.0, while the other was resuspended in 20% (v/v) ethylene glycol, 0.4 m KCl, 10 mm EGTA, 50 mm MOPS-Na, pH 7.0. Digestion with trypsin was then carried out as described above. The soluble products were separated from insoluble (membrane-bound) material and concentrated by the DOC-trichloroacetic acid procedure described above. The phosphorylated samples were electrophoresed in the Tricine SDS gel system, and autoradiography of the dried gel was carried out using Kodak X-Omat film.Production of Rabbit Polyclonal Antibody against the ∼37-kDa Soluble Tryptic FragmentThe soluble tryptic fraction formed in the presence of Ca2+ was run on a Tricine SDS gel. The gel was then lightly stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue, and the ∼37-kDa band was cut out with a razor blade. The gel slice was homogenized in PBS (0.15 m NaCl, 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.2) and Freund's complete adjuvant before injection into New Zealand White rabbits. Booster injections were made every third week using Freund's incomplete adjuvant. Partial purification of antibody from serum was by ammonium sulfate fractionation, followed by DEAE-Sephacel anion exchange chromatography to separate IgG and IgM (33Dunbar B.S. Schwoebel E. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 182: 663-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar).Western BlottingSDS gels were first blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride (Immobilon PSQ), as in the procedure for N-terminal sequencing (see above). Nonspecific binding was blocked with 5% w/v nonfat milk in PBS-T (0.1 m NaCl, O.1% v/v Tween-20, 0.1 m NaPi, pH 7.4) for 1 h at room temperature. The blots were washed twice quickly in PBS-T, followed by one wash for 15 min and two washes for 5 min in PBS-T. The blots were incubated in rabbit anti-37-kDa antibody diluted 1:1000 with 5% (w/v) nonfat dried milk, 0.1% v/v Tween-20 in PBS-for 1 h at room temperature with gentle agitation. The blots were then washed as before with PBS-T. The blots were then incubated for 1 h in goat anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) that had been diluted 1:1,500 in 5% (w/v) dried milk in PBS-T. After washing again with PBS-T, the blots were incubated with the ECL luminol system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech).Protein ConcentrationThis was by the bicinchoninic acid method (34Smith P.K.

One of these (the B2 fraction; see “Experimental Procedures”) is enriched in fragmented SR but still contaminated by membranes derived from the SL (25Kalabokis V. Hardwicke P.M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15184-15188Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Hardwicke P.M.D. Ryan C. Kalabokis V.N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1417: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). This fraction can be extracted with low (nonsolubilizing) concentrations of DOC to remove peripheral membrane proteins and other contaminants (25Kalabokis V. Hardwicke P.M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15184-15188Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). On SDS gels of the DOC-extracted B2 fraction, ∼90% of the Coomassie Blue-staining material has a mobility corresponding to a molecular mass of 105–115 kDa (Fig. 1and Ref. 25Kalabokis V. Hardwicke P.M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15184-15188Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), consistent with the size of the Ca-ATPase (25Kalabokis V. Hardwicke P.M.D. J. Biol.

Kalabokis V.N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1417: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar).Tryptic digests of the DOC-extracted scallop muscle B2membrane fraction were examined for soluble peptide fragments released by the action of the protease. It was found that a polypeptide of ∼37 kDa was the major soluble species formed in the presence of 1 mm Ca2+ (Fig. 2), although smaller amounts of soluble ∼16- and ∼19-kDa peptides were sometimes also present. In the presence of 10 mm EGTA, the pattern of the products was reversed, so that the ∼37-kDa fragment was either absent or present in much smaller amounts, and the two smaller polypeptides were the main soluble products. The relative proportions of ∼16- and ∼19-kDa peptides varied; sometimes the two species were present in approximately the same amounts, whereas in other digests one form predominated. This may mean that the 16- and 19-kDa fragments are susceptible to further proteolysis; in contrast, the ∼37-kDa peptide was relatively resistant to the further action of trypsin. All three soluble peptides could be clearly visualized on the gels with standard Coomassie Blue stain. Occasionally, larger soluble polypeptides of ∼60 and 40 kDa were observed.Figure 2Effect of Ca2+ concentration on soluble tryptic fragments produced from a deoxycholate-treated scallop muscle membrane fraction. Digestion of deoxycholate-extracted scallop muscle membrane B2 was carried out in the presence of EGTA and Ca2+ as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The soluble peptides formed in the presence of CaCl2 and EGTA were concentrated by the DOC-trichloroacetic acid method and electrophoresed in the Tricine SDS-PAGE system. The bands labeled t in lanes 1 and 2 are trypsin (molecular mass, 23.8 kDa) and of two its autolyzis products.Lane 1, soluble peptides formed from 190 μg of total membrane protein in the presence of EGTA. Lane 2, soluble peptides formed from 190 μg of total membrane protein in the presence of Ca2+. Lane 3, markers.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The precursor polypeptide for the soluble peptides had to be very close in size to the scallop SERCA (molecular mass, 110 kDa), because only material of 105–115 kDa was present in sufficient amounts in the starting preparation to account for the amounts of soluble peptides formed (Fig. 1 and Ref. 25Kalabokis V. Hardwicke P.M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15184-15188Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). There are usually only small and variable traces of other integral protein membrane components on Coomassie Blue stained SDS gels of the B2 fraction after DOC extraction, the most significant of these being a 28-kDa protein associated with the SL (25Kalabokis V. Hardwicke P.M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15184-15188Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Hardwicke P.M.D. Ryan C. Kalabokis V.N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1417: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). The latter peptide is too small to be the precursor of the 37-kDa soluble tryptic fragment and in any case is present only at low levels.The results of N-terminal sequencing of the soluble fragments are shown in Table I, where the data have been aligned to show the apparent relationships between the peptides and some sodium-calcium exchangers. The ∼37-kDa peptide produced in the presence of Ca2+ and the ∼16-kDa polypeptide formed by digestion in the absence of Ca2+ had the same N-terminal sequence. Comparison of this N-terminal sequence with known sequences using the EMBL data base (Blitz) indicated that its start corresponded to residue 401(369) of the NCX1 Na+-Ca2+exchanger, at the N-terminal end of the β-1 repeat in the large cytoplasmic domain (loop f) (2Nicoll D.A. Longoni S. Philipson K.D. Science. 1990; 250: 562-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar, 4Nicoll D.A. Quednau B.D. Qui Z. Xia Y.-R. Lusis A.J. Philipson K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24914-24921Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). A lysyl or arginyl residue must precede this sequence for the 37- and 16-kDa fragments to be produced by the action of trypsin. There was no significant similarity to any part of the scallop Ca-ATPase polypeptide chain (36Shi X. Chen M. Huvos P.E. Hardwicke P.M.D. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. Part B. 1998; 120: 359-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Assuming an average residue mass of 110 Da, the ∼16-kDa fragment was approximately 145 residues long and was likely to correspond closely to the segment of loop f in NCX1 that starts and ends with the two acidic triads, Asp478(446)-Asp-Asp at the carboxyl end of β-1 and Asp530(498)-Asp-Asp preceding the β-2 repeat. The Ca2+-insensitive cleavage site on the scallop precursor represented by the N terminus of the ∼16- and ∼37-kDa soluble fragments will be designated the T1 site. The C terminus of the ∼16-kDa fragment must be located in a stretch of polypeptide chain inaccessible to trypsin when Ca2+ is bound to the precursor protein but more susceptible to proteolysis when Ca2+is unbound. The Ca2+-sensitive proteolytic cleavage site represented by the C terminus of the ∼16-kDa fragment will be designated the T2 site. Satisfactory N-terminal sequencing of the ∼19-kDa band peptide was not possible, because of microheterogeneity within that band on SDS gels, but the size of the fragment is consistent with it representing that part of the 37-kDa fragment which is C-terminal to the T2 cleavage site. There is other evidence supporting this conclusion from the immunological and phosphorylation studies reported below. The tryptic cleavage site corresponding to the C terminus of the 37-kDa fragment, and possibly the C terminus of the 19-kDa fragment, will be designated the T3 site.Table IComparison of the N-terminal sequences of tryptic fragments from scallop muscle membranes with some sodium-calcium exchangersR/KDQFTTKVFFDPGHYTVMENScallop soluble 37 kDaR/KDQFTTKVFFDPGHYTVMENScallop soluble 16 kDaPDEI-TRVSFDPGHYTVMEN390Squid NCX-SQI (12)ADD-PIRMYFEPGHYTVMEN456Calx(Drosophila) (10)NDPV-SKIFFEQGTYQCLEN418DogNCX1 (6)NDPV-SKVFFEPGTYQCLEN418RatNCX1 (9)DDDGASRIFFEPSLYHCLEN408RatNCX2 (7)PEDFASKVFFDPCSYQCLEN410RatNCX3 (8) Open table in a new tab Polyclonal Antibody against the 37-kDa Soluble Fragment Cross-reacts with the 16- and 19-kDa Soluble Tryptic Fragments and Also a 105–110-kDa Polypeptide in the Undigested MembranesThe soluble fragments formed in the presence of Ca2+ were separated on a Tricine SDS gel, and a Western blot was obtained using polyclonal rabbit IgG raised against the ∼37-kDa peptide.

https://openalex.org/W2105357913,"The lactose transport protein (LacS) of Streptococcus thermophilus belongs to a family of transporters in which putative α-helices II and IV have been implicated in cation binding and the coupled transport of the substrate and the cation. Here, the analysis of site-directed mutants shows that a positive and negative charge at positions 64 and 71 in helix II are essential for transport, but not for lactose binding. The conservation of charge/side-chain properties is less critical for Glu-67 and Ile-70 in helix II, and Asp-133 and Lys-139 in helix IV, but these residues are important for the coupled transport of lactose together with a proton. The analysis of second-site suppressor mutants indicates an ion pair exists between helices II and IV, and thus a close approximation of these helices can be made. The second-site suppressor analysis also suggests ion pairing between helix II and the intracellular loops 6–7 and 10–11. Because the C-terminal region of the transmembrane domain, especially helix XI and loop 10–11, is important for substrate binding in this family of proteins, we propose that sugar and proton binding and translocation are performed by the joint action of these regions in the protein. Indeed, substrate protection of maleimide labeling of single cysteine mutants confirms that α-helices II and IV are directly interacting or at least conformationally involved in sugar binding and/or translocation. On the basis of new and published data, we reason that the helices II, IV, VII, X, and XI and the intracellular loops 6–7 and 10–11 are in close proximity and form the binding sites and/or the translocation pathway in the transporters of the galactosides-pentosides-hexuronides family.

Microbiol. 1996; 19: 911-922Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar).In vivo, LacS catalyzes a lactose/galactose exchange reaction, which is driven by the concentration gradients of both sugars across the membrane (2Poolman B. Mol. Microbiol. 1990; 4: 1629-1636Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 3Foucaud C. Poolman B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22087-22094Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The LacS protein also catalyzes solute-H+ symport, which is the proton motive force (Δp)-driven solute accumulation, but this transport mode is an order of magnitude slower than the exchange reaction (4Knol J. Veenhoff L. Liang W.-J. Henderson P.J.F. Leblanc G. Poolman B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15358-15366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Kinetic analysis has shown that, not only in the solute-H+ symport but also in the exchange mode of transport, protons participate in the translocation process (5Poolman B. Knol J. Lolkema J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12995-13003Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). When catalyzing exchange transport, sugar binding occurs in an alternating manner at the cytoplasmic and extracellular binding site. Specificity studies have revealed that the sugar binding site has a different architecture when exposed to the cytoplasmic or the extracellular face of the membrane (6Veenhoff L.M. Poolman B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33244-33250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The intracellularly facing binding site has a high affinity for galactose through interactions with the C-2 and C-6 hydroxyl groups of the sugar; these hydroxyl groups do not participate in the binding of the sugar to the extracellularly facing binding site. Both binding sites and the translocation pathway are spacious in the C-1 to C-4 axes of the galactose moiety, because they are able to accommodate galactosides with large substitutions, especially the galactose C-1, e.g.trisaccharides or galactosides substituted with an aromatic ring are bound and transported. In an effort to understand where the sites for substrate and cation binding are located in the members of the GPH family, several approaches, ranging from mutant isolation/selection to biophysical methods (e.g. 7Botfield M.C.

The transmembrane or carrier domain of the proteins from the GPH family comprises 12 transmembrane-spanning α-helices. Comparison of the primary sequence of members of the GPH family has identified some general features. First, the putative α-helices II, IV, and IX have an amphipathic character suggesting interactions with both apolar/hydrophobic and polar/hydrophilic surfaces (1Poolman B. Knol J. van der Does C. Henderson P.J.F. Liang W.-J. Leblanc G. Pourcher T. Mus-Veteau I. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 19: 911-922Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The strongly hydrophilic character of one side of the transmembrane helices II and IV results from the presence of a number of conserved positively and negatively charged residues (see Fig. 1). These residues are thought to coordinate cation binding in the melibiose carrier (MelB) fromEscherichia coli (1Poolman B. Knol J. van der Does C. Henderson P.J.F. Liang W.-J. Leblanc G. Pourcher T.

Wilson T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1063-1067Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Second, the GPH family is characterized by a high sequence conservation in the loop between helices X and XI (see Fig. 1) (1Poolman B. Knol J. van der Does C. Henderson P.J.F. Liang W.-J. Leblanc G. Pourcher T. Mus-Veteau I. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 19: 911-922Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Electron spin resonance (ESR) studies have indicated that this region is not nearly as flexible as would be expected for such a large loop, and thus possibly it is located in the core of the protein (14Spooner P.J.R. Veenhoff L.M. Watts A. Poolman B. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 9634-9639Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Moreover, a conserved residue Glu-379 in this loop is essential in coupling the transport of protons to the transport of sugar, because neutral substitution renders LacS unable to catalyze lactose-H+ symport, whereas equilibrium transport is still catalyzed with wild type rates (5Poolman B. Knol J. Lolkema J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12995-13003Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Approximation of residue 373 in loop 10–11 within 15 Å from the C-1 atom of a galactose molecule in the binding site of LacS is apparent from solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance studies (14Spooner P.J.R. Veenhoff L.M. Watts A. Poolman B. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 9634-9639Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Obviously, proton and sugar transport by LacS are not separate events. Conformational coupling between sugar and proton binding/translocation will occur, and possibly the two ligands are transported through the same translocation pathway. By isolating and characterizing site-directed and second-site suppressor mutants, and by assessing site-directed modification of LacS in the presence and absence of sugar, we have obtained further information on the localization of regions and residues that are important for sugar and proton binding/translocation. An extended helix packing model is presented that brings together the catalytically important regions, that is, α-helices II and IV, loop region 10–11, and α-helix IX. d-[glucose-1-14C]lactose (2.11 teslabecquerels/mol) was obtained from the Radiochemical Center, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Restriction enzymes, Pwo DNA polymerase, Triton X-100, and streptavidin-alkaline phosphatase conjugate were from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Bacteriological media were from Difco. Hydroxylamine, 3-(N-maleimidopropinyl)biocytin (biotin-maleimide), and N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) were purchased from Sigma. Ni-NTA resin was from Qiagen, Inc. All other materials were of reagent grade and obtained from commercial sources. E. coli strains HB101 (15Boyer H.W. Roulland-Dussoix D. J. Mol.

When appropriate, the medium was supplemented with 50 μmg/ml ampicillin and/or 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. pSKE8His-derived plasmids, encoding single cysteine mutants of LacS with a C-terminal 6-histidine tag, are listed in Table I. pSKE8his(C320A) was constructed by exchange of the NcoI/PstI fragment from pGKhis(C320A) (4Knol J.

Site-directed mutagenesis was performed by PCR using mutagenic primers and pSKE8his(C320A) DNA as template. Mutants are indicated by a letter-number-letter code, in which the first letter corresponds to the amino acid that is substituted and the second one indicates the substitution; the number corresponds to the position of the residue in wild type LacS.

To stop the reaction, a 20-μl sample was diluted into 15 μl of ice-cold 2.35 m NH4Ac, and the DNA was precipitated with ethanol and dissolved in 4 μl of water. 2.5 μl was used to transform E. coli HB101, and cells were plated on MacConkey agar with 1% lactose. Red colonies appeared after overnight incubation. Notice that HB101/pSKE8his(C320A, R64C) and HB101/pSKE8his(C320A, D71C) gave rise to white colonies due to an inactive LacS protein (see “Results”). DNA was isolated from 50 red colonies, and used to retransform the HB101 cells. About 70% of the clones had retained the red phenotype on lactose-MacConkey agar, and DNA was isolated and subjected to DNA sequencing from 18 of these. Transport of [14C]lactose was assayed at 30 °C using the rapid filtration technique (17Poolman B. Modderman R. Reizer J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9150-9157Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The transport reactions were stopped at different time intervals by dilution into 2 ml of ice-cold 0.1 m LiCl, rapid filtering on 0.45-μm cellulose nitrate filters (Schleicher & Schuell), and washing with another 2 ml 0.1m LiCl. Lactose transport down the concentration gradient was measured in E. coli HB101 cells that were grown overnight in LB with 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for maximal expression of β-galactosidase. The cells were washed twice in KPM (50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, with 2 mmMgSO4) and resuspended to 30–40 mg/ml. Aliquots of 6 μl were diluted into 200 μl of KPM with 10 mmd-lithium lactate, and after 2 min of aeration, 50 μM [14C]lactose was added to initiate the reaction. Δp-driven accumulation of lactose was measured in E. coli DW2 cells that were grown overnight on LB and washed twice with KPM. Aliquots of 6 μl cells (30–40 mg/ml) were diluted into 200 μl of KPM with 10 mmd-lithium lactate, and after 2 min of aeration, the uptake was started by the addition of 50 μmM [14C]lactose. E. coli DW2 cells, grown overnight on LB and washed twice with KPM, were preloaded with [14C]lactose by overnight incubation with 2.75 mm[14C]lactose in KPM. Cells were de-energized by incubation with 30 mm sodium azide and 50 μM SF6847 for 2 h at room temperature. The uptake was started by dilution of 2 μl of 50 mg/ml cell suspension into KPM or KPM with 100 μM lactose for efflux and exchange, respectively. Overnight cultures of E. coli HB101 were washed three times and resuspended in KPM to 30–40 mg/ml. To aliquots of 100-μl cell suspensions, 10 μl of 100 mmmethyl-β-d-thiogalactoside (TMG) or 10 μl of buffer (control) was added. After 10 min of equilibration at 37 °C, freshly prepared NEM was added to a final concentration of 3 mm. After 30 min of incubation at room temperature, the reaction was stopped by the addition of 12 mm dithiothreitol (DTT). The cells were washed four times with 15 volumes of KPM. Lactose uptake down the concentration gradient was measured as described above. The labeling with biotin-maleimide was performed as described in the previous paragraph, except that 950 μl of cell suspension, 400 μl of 250 mm lactose or buffer, and 45 μl of 100 mm biotin-maleimide in Me2SO were used. The reaction was stopped by diluting the cells 40 times into KPM with 4 mm DTT. After washing with KPM, the cells were resuspended in 2 ml of KPM and disrupted by sonication. The cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 9000 × g for 10 min, after which the membranes were collected at 250,000 × g for 15 min. The membranes were solubilized in 0.5% Triton X-100, and LacS was purified using Ni+-affinity chromatography as described previously, except that the column was washed with double the volume of wash buffer (4Knol J. Veenhoff L. Liang W.-J. Henderson P.J.F. Leblanc G. Poolman B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15358-15366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The purified fractions were analyzed by immunodetection with antibodies raised against LacS and streptavidin-alkaline phosphatase conjugate. The amount of wild type and mutant LacS protein was estimated by immunodetection of LacS with antibodies raised against the IIA domain (18Gunnewijk M.G. Postma P.W. Poolman B. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 632-641Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Whole cell samples, prepared by boiling washed cell suspensions for 5 min in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis sample buffer, or inside-out membrane vesicle samples (17Poolman B. Modderman R. Reizer J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9150-9157Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis sample buffer were separated on a 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes by semi-dry electroblotting. Detection, using the Western-Light chemiluminescence detection kit with 3-(4-methoxyspiro{1,2-dioxetan-3.2′-(5′chloro)tricyclo[3.3.1.13.7]decan}-4-yl)phenylphosphate, disodium salt as substrate, was performed as described by Tropix, Inc. The lactose transport protein (LacS) of S. thermophilushas several charged amino acids in the second and fourth transmembrane α-helix that are highly conserved within the GPH family (Fig.1). To investigate the role of these charged amino acids in catalysis, each of these residues was replaced by cysteines or a charge-conserving amino acid, and the effect of the mutation on lactose transport was determined. Each of the mutants was made in the lacS(C320A) allele; the activity of LacS(C320A) was comparable to that of wild type LacS (Fig. 3 A). Wild type LacS and the different mutants were expressed to similar levels as was determined by immunodetection of LacS in whole cell samples; typical examples are shown in Fig. 2. Because LacS(R64C) and LacS(D71C) were inactive, it was possible that these mutants were not assembled in the cytoplasmic membrane. Immunoblotting of inside-out membrane vesicles isolated from HB101 cells showed that LacS(R64C) and LacS(D71C) were present in the membrane at comparable levels as the wild type protein. Next, each of the mutants was characterized by assaying four modes of transport: [14C]lactose uptake down the concentration gradient (downhill uptake), Δp-driven [14C]lactose uptake, [14C]lactose efflux down the concentration gradient, and [14C]lactose/lactose exchange. Transport rates are presented as percentage of the transport rates catalyzed by wild type LacS, as expressed from pSKE8his (Fig.3 A).Figure 2Expression levels of LacS in E. coli HB101.

The charge-conserving mutations R64K and D71E rendered the proteins partially active in all four modes of transport (not shown), from which we conclude that a positively charged residue at position 64 and a negatively charged one at position 71 are essential for transport activity. Cysteine substitution of the residues Glu-67 and Asp-133 abolished Δp-driven uptake completely but did not effect the exchange and downhill uptake. Strikingly, the E67C and D133C mutants showed a more than 4-fold increase in the rate of lactose efflux. The K139C mutant displayed transport properties similar to those of E67C and D133C, although the downhill uptake and exchange reactions were significantly reduced; the efflux and exchange transport of the parent allele and K139C are shown in somewhat more detail in Fig.3 B. Cysteine substitution of Ile-70 did not affect exchange and efflux and uptake down the concentration gradient, but largely impaired Δp-driven uptake. Contrary to the substitutions of the heretofore described highly conserved residues, cysteine substitution of residues on the hydrophobic faces of helices II and IV,e.g. Ile-65, Val-134, and Phe-135 did not have an effect on any of the transport modes. Altogether, we conclude that the residues Arg-64 and Asp-71 in helix II are essential for transport, whereas Glu-67, Ile-70, Asp-133, and Lys-139 are needed for the coupled transport of a sugar molecule together with a proton. Second-site suppressor mutations can yield information about close approximation of residues within the protein, because the defect of the primary mutation can be restored by substitution of one or more neighboring residues (19Nikolova P.V. Wong K.-B. DeDecker B. Henckel J. Fersht A.R. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 370-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 20Zhang Y. Fillingame R.H. J. Biol.

This genetic technique can be particularly powerful when functional ion pairs within the protein are involved (21Sahin-Toth M. Dunten R.L. Gonzalez A. Kaback H.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10547-10551Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 22Frillingos S. Sahin-Toth M. Lengeler J.W. Kaback H.R.

Two mutants in helix II, i.e.LacShis(R64C) and LacShis(D71C), were used for selection of second-site suppressors, because these displayed a white phenotype on lactose-MacConkey plates. Consistent with the transport data (Fig.3 A), the wild type and all other mutants had a red (or pink, K139C) colony phenotype. Transport positive colonies turn red on the indicator plates as a result of acidification of the medium after lactose fermentation. Hydroxylamine-mutagenized plasmid DNA (pSKE8his(C320A, R64C) or pSKEhis(C320A, D71C)) was transformed to HB101, and cells were plated on lactose-MacConkey agar. DNA was isolated from 50 red colonies and used to retransform HB101 cells. About 70% of the clones had retained the red phenotype and from 18 highly red colonies, 8 suppressors from pSKE8his(R64C) and 10 from pSKE8his(D71C), DNA was isolated and the entire lacS genes were sequenced. The second-site suppressors had on average two mutations of which some were silent (TableII). All mutations are C → T or G → A substitutions as is expected from the mechanism of hydroxylamine mutagenesis (24Shugar D. Huber C.P. Birnbaum G.I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1976; 447: 274-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar).Table IISecond-site suppressors of LacS D71C and LacS R64CMutations2-aThe mutations indicated in bold are responsible for the gain of transport function as was shown after construction of single-site suppressors by site-directed mutagenesis (Fig. 4).Location of suppressor mutationActivity2-bThe downhill transport activity, presented as a percentage of the transport activity of wild type LacS, was measured as described in the legend to Fig. 3.

The error in the measurements is ±5%. Open table in a new tab Mutations suppressing the defect in R64C were found in the portion of the gene that corresponds to the N-terminal region of the protein, i.e.α-helix II (S61F, P72L), cytoplasmic loop 2–3 (G75S), and α-helix IV (D133N). Although clearly red on lactose-MacConkey agar, downhill lactose uptake catalyzed by these suppressors was less than 15% of the wild type activity, indicating a poor Km and/orV max (Fig. 4; data not shown). Neither of the suppressor mutations restored the Δp-driven lactose accumulation capacity of the wild type (not shown). Regained activity in LacS(R64C, D133N) suggests that in the wild type LacS the opposite charges at positions 64 and 133 are stabilized by the formation of an ion pair, indicating a close approximation of helices II and IV. Consistent with this suggestion is the observation that the residues 133 and 64 are located at approximately the same height in the membrane. An unpaired charge on Asp-133 would thus inactivate the carrier protein, and neutralization of this residue restores activity. Along similar lines of reasoning one could explain the S61F suppressor mutation. The aromatic side chain of Phe-61, which is located one helix turn above Arg-64, might lower the polarity of the environment around the carboxylate Asp-133, and thereby increase its pKA. The unpaired charge of the carboxylate of Asp-133 in LacS(R64C, S61F) would thus be neutralized at the prevailing pH. To obtain further evidence for the hypothesis of the ion pair between Arg-64 and Asp-133, the double mutant LacS(R64C, D133C) was constructed. As anticipated, the transport activity and phenotype on lactose-MacConkey agar was similar to that of LacS(R64C, D133N) (Fig. 4). When the residues 64 and 133 are in close proximity, replacement of Asp-133 for an arginine might well be tolerated in the R64C background. This is indeed the case, LacS(R64C, D133R) shows 40% downhill transport activity compared with wild type LacS (Fig. 4). The P72L and G75S suppressor mutations are less easily explained, but might relate to a different position of helix II in the membrane,e.g. a position that places the unpaired charge at Asp-133 in a less unfavorable environment. In contrast to the mutations suppressing the R64C substitution, those suppressing D71C were found in different regions of the LacS molecule. Most active was the triple mutant LacS(D71C, R377H, D378N) with two mutations in inter-helix loop 10–11. This mutant catalyzed downhill lactose uptake at more than 60% the rate catalyzed by the wild type protein. It did not catalyze significant Δp-driven uptake as was the case for the other D71C suppressors. To dissect which of the mutations, R377H or D378N, suppressed the defect of D71C, the corresponding “single” mutants LacS(D71C, R377H), LacS(D71C, D378N), LacS(D71C, R377C), LacS(D71C, R377D), and LacS(D71C, D378C) were constructed by site-directed mutagenesis. The transport data clearly indicate that the Arg-377 substitution is responsible for the gain of function (Fig.4). The second most active D71C suppressors (60% of the wild type) were LacS(D71C, R230C) and LacS(D71C, R230C, G546K, G572S). The R230C substitution is responsible for the restored activity, because the G546K and G572S mutations in the regulatory (IIA) domain of LacS did not alter uptake rate. Site-directed substitution of Arg-230 for an alanine or an aspartate also restored activity in the D71C mutant. The second-site suppressors LacS(L357F, T411I) and LacS(F261L, L357F, T411I) catalyzed downhill uptake at a rate that is 30% of the wild type. They have the mutation L357F in common, which is located in helix X. Because the double mutant LacS(D71C, L357F) constructed by site-directed mutagenesis showed a similar transport activity, we conclude that the Leu to Phe substitution at position 357 restored the transport activity (Fig. 4). The second-site mutations P72S, A161T, A149V, and (S61F, P72L, T81I) are all located in the intracellular half of helix II or the intracellular loops 2–3 and 4–5. This is in accordance with a close approximation of helices II and IV, which was already concluded from the R64C suppressors. Strikingly, some of the mutations suppressing the D71C mutation are the same or similar to the ones suppressing the R64C mutation, e.g. the suppressor mutations S61F and/or P72L are found in the following combinations (R64C, S61F, P72L), (D71C, S61F, P72L, T81I), and (D71C, P72S).

We have cloned a full-length cDNA encoding rat dynein light chain protein,robl/LC7-like (class 1), from visual cortex. We found that rat robl/LC7-like gene is highly expressed in neocortex and displays the unusual feature of being rapidly down-regulated by sensory stimulation. This effect was seen at both mRNA and protein levels in visual cortex, being detectable in as little as 45 min after the onset of visual stimulation. Down-regulation by sensory stimulation was also found within ocular dominance columns of area V1 in monocularly deprived monkeys. Our results suggest a high turnover rate of therobl/LC7-like protein and the presence of a repressor mechanism in neurons that is tightly coupled to synaptic stimulation."
