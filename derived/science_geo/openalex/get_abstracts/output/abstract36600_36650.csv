https://openalex.org/W2107620873,"The yeast trans-activator protein GAL4, when expressed in HeLa cells, stimulates transcription from several class B (II) eukaryotic promoters containing GAL4 binding sites either as the full UASG or as synthetic 17-mers. The characteristics of this activation are indistinguishable from those of the SV40 enhancer. Transcription was similarly stimulated from either complex promoter regions containing multiple upstream elements or from a simple promoter region composed of only a TATA box. Addition of a 17-mer GAL4 binding site to the SV40 enhancer resulted in a synergistic enhancement of transcription in the presence of GAL4. Furthermore, chimeras of the human estrogen receptor DNA binding domain and either GAL4 or GCN4 activating ""acidic"" regions can activate a promoter region controlled by an estrogen-responsive enhancer. Together, these data indicate that the molecular mechanisms responsible for transcriptional enhancement have been conserved from yeast to man."
https://openalex.org/W2013087078,"GAL4, a protein that activates transcription in yeast, is shown to activate the mouse mammary tumor virus promoter in mammalian cells. Activation depends upon a GAL4-binding sequence inserted upstream of the gene. Deletion mutants of GAL4 bearing one or both of the ""activating regions"" required for activation in yeast also activate transcription in mammalian cells. A derivative of GAL4 that binds to DNA but cannot activate transcription in yeast also fails to activate transcription in mammalian cells. We also show that GAL4 and the glucocorticoid receptor activate the mouse mammary tumor virus promoter synergistically."
https://openalex.org/W1618760884,"The iodinated Mr approximately equal to 15,000 amino-terminal fragment (ATF) of the urokinase-type plasminogen activator (u-PA) molecule bound specifically to the cell surface of all of seven cultured human tumor cell lines studied. Cross-linking of iodinated ATF to the cell surface using a bifunctional amino-reactive reagent followed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography revealed with the four cell lines studied the occurrence of a single band migrating with an Mr of 70,000-75,000, indicating complex formation with an Mr of 55,000-60,000 u-PA receptor protein (u-PA-R). In the human monocyte cell line U937 cultivated in the presence of phorbol ester, the amount of complex was strongly increased, and a fraction of the complex had a slower electrophoretic mobility. Comparison between autoradiograms of reduced and unreduced samples suggests that u-PA-R consists of one polypeptide chain. Two forms of u-PA-R, which differed with respect to affinity to concanavalin A, were identified. u-PA-R retained its ability to bind to ATF after cell lysis, and it was purified approximately 2,200-fold from biosynthetically labeled U937 cells by affinity chromatography with proenzyme u-PA coupled to Sepharose. The purified Mr 55,000-60,000 protein was specifically bound and cross-linked to u-PA, proenzyme u-PA, and ATF, but not to tissue-type plasminogen activator or other unrelated proteins."

https://openalex.org/W1963689659,"Soluble products of either Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-infected B cells or activated monocytes promote the proliferation of EBV-infected B cells and permit their growth at low cell densities. This suggests that growth factors are important for B-cell immortalization by EBV. In this study, a monocyte-derived factor that promotes the growth of EBV-infected b cells was purified and identified as interferon-beta 2 (IFN-beta 2), which is also known as 26-kilodalton protein, B-cell differentiation factor (BSF-2), and interleukin-6 (IL-6). The purified protein has a specific activity of approximately 4 X 10(7) units per milligram of protein in assays of B-cell growth. Thus, IFN-beta 2/BSF-2 is a B-cell growth factor that promotes the proliferation of human B cells infected with EBV."
https://openalex.org/W2123327793,"Macrophages can be activated to produce reactive oxygen intermediates, such as superoxide anion (O2-), which are responsible for intracellular killing of pathogenic microbes. Treatment with either native or recombinant somatotropin augmented the production of O2- by both peripheral blood-derived and alveolar macrophages stimulated with opsonized zymosan in vitro. This effect was abolished by prior treatment with an antibody specific for somatotropin. When either native or recombinant porcine somatotropin or native rat somatotropin was administered to hypophysectomized rats in vivo, activation of peritoneal macrophages, as measured by release of O2- in response to opsonized zymosan, was equivalent to that of macrophages from rats primed with the macrophage-activating factor interferon-γ. Priming of macrophages in vivo was observed at physiologically relevant doses of somatotropin that caused a 10 to 40 percent increase in growth rate. Priming of mononuclear phagocytes for augmented production of reactive oxygen metabolites is a newly defined property of somatotropin."
https://openalex.org/W1559327360,"Uric acid has previously been shown to act as a water-soluble antioxidant. Although the antioxidant activity of uric acid has been attributed to its ability to scavenge free radicals, the one-electron uric acid oxidation product of such a scavenging reaction has not been detected. It order to determine whether a free radical metabolite of uric acid could be formed via one-electron redox processes, we oxidized uric acid with potassium permanganate, horseradish peroxidase/hydrogen peroxide, and hematin/hydrogen peroxide systems. With the use of the rapid-mixing, continuous-flow electron spin resonance technique, we were able to detect the urate anion free radical in all three radical-generating systems. Based on N15-isotopic-labeling experiments, we show that the unpaired electron of this radical is located primarily on the five-membered ring of the purine structure. We were also able to demonstrate that this radical could be scavenged by ascorbic acid."

https://openalex.org/W1585663943,"Human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) is a cytokine derived from activated T cells, endothelial cells, fibroblasts, and macrophages. It stimulates myeloid and erythroid progenitors to form colonies in semisolid medium in vitro, as well as enhancing multiple differentiated functions of mature neutrophils, macrophages, and eosinophils. We have examined the binding of human GM-CSF to a variety of responsive human cells and cell lines. The most mature myelomonocytic cells, specifically human neutrophils, macrophages, and eosinophils, express the highest numbers of a single class of high affinity receptors (Kd approximately 37 pM, 293-1000 sites/cell). HL-60 and KG-1 cells exhibit an increase in specific binding at high concentrations of GM-CSF; computer analysis of the data is nonetheless consistent with a single class of high affinity binding sites with a Kd approximately 43 pM and 20-450 sites/cell. Dimethyl sulfoxide induces a 3-10-fold increase in high affinity receptors expressed in HL-60 cells, coincident with terminal neutrophilic differentiation. Finally, binding of 125I-GM-CSF to fresh peripheral blood cells from six patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia was analyzed. In three of six cases, binding was similar to the nonsaturable binding observed with HL-60 and KG-1 cells. GM-CSF binding was low, or in some cases, undetectable on myeloblasts obtained from eight patients with acute myelogenous leukemia. The observed affinities of the receptor for GM-CSF are consistent with all known biological activities. Affinity labeling of both normal neutrophils and dimethyl sulfoxide-induced HL-60 cells with unglycosylated 125I-GM-CSF yielded a band of 98 kDa, implying a molecular weight of approximately 84,000 for the human GM-CSF receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1546267534,"To establish some of the necessary steps in the toxic action of paraquat for cultured mammalian cells, we isolated paraquat-resistant HeLa cells after lethal increments in concentration of paraquat in the medium. The paraquat-resistant cells had increased the cellular content of both the Mn-containing and the CuZn-containing superoxide dismutases. The effect of paraquat on the consumption of oxygen by the wild-type and the resistance cells was similar; in both cases exposure to paraquat for 24 or more hours produced similar proportions of cyanide-resistant consumption of oxygen, suggesting that paraquat entered both cells, underwent reduction, and donated electrons to molecular oxygen. When cultivated for 5 months in the absence of paraquat the paraquat-resistant cells maintained the increased cellular content of superoxide dismutases and remained resistant to paraquat. This observation suggested that resistance to paraquat might be caused by enrichment for the two superoxide dismutases and, further, that the increased cellular content of the two enzymes was not a response to growth under stressful conditions. NIH/3T3 cells whose content of superoxide dismutase was increased by transcription of the transfected cDNA for the human CuZn superoxide dismutase were also resistant to paraquat, suggesting strongly that paraquat promotes the formation of O2- as a necessary part of its cytotoxic effects in two types of cultured mammalian cells."

https://openalex.org/W1986074692,"The turnover of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) is believed to constitute a crucial step in the signaling pathways for stimulation of cells by a variety of bioactive substances, including mitogens, but decisive evidence for the idea has not been obtained. In the present study, a monoclonal antibody to PIP2 was microinjected into the cytoplasm of NIH 3T3 cells before or after exposure to mitogens. The antibody completely abolished nuclear labeling with [3H]thymidine induced by platelet-derived growth factor and bombesin, but not by fibroblast growth factor, epidermal growth factor, insulin, or serum. The findings strongly suggest that PIP2 breakdown is crucial in the elicitation and sustaining of cell proliferation induced by some types of mitogens such as platelet-derived growth factor and bombesin."
https://openalex.org/W1511655466,"Abstract Streptozotocin diabetic rats showed more than a 4-fold increase in blood glucose levels, whereas hepatic glycogen, fructose 2,6-bisphosphate concentration, and 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase activity were decreased. The total 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase and the active (nonphosphorylated) form of the enzyme were decreased to a different extent, resulting in a fall of the active/total activity ratio. Vanadate administration for a 2-week period restored the altered values in the diabetic rats without modifying significantly in the control animals any of the parameters studied. Glucokinase activity was essentially lacking in the diabetic animals, and vanadate treatment restored the activity to about 65% of its control value, a good correlation between the recovery of the enzyme and the blood glucose level being observed. These results show an insulin-like effect of vanadate in the whole animal and suggest that insulin and vanadate possess similar actions on hepatic intracellular events."
https://openalex.org/W1607257501,"The first intron of the human alpha 1(I) collagen gene contains a negatively acting element that inhibits transcription of the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene driven by either a collagen or an SV40 basal promoter (Bornstein, P., McKay, J., Morishima, J., Devarayalu, S., and Gelinas, R. E. (1987) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 84, in press). We now find that this element is flanked by sequences that both neutralize the inhibitory effect and impart a net positive effect on transcription. A collagen-human growth hormone minigene was constructed in which varying lengths of the collagen intron were retained. Plasmids were transfected into chick tendon fibroblasts, and transcriptional activity was measured by solution hybridization with an antisense RNA probe. The presence of the intact intronic sequence stimulated transcription by a factor of 2-3-fold in comparison with intron-deleted plasmids. However, the isolated negatively acting element inhibited transcription by a factor of 15-20-fold. Surprisingly, this effect was markedly orientation-dependent. Intronic segments flanking the negatively acting element stimulated transcription both when cloned 5' to the collagen promoter in chloramphenicol acetyltransferase-based plasmids and 3' in collagen-human growth hormone constructions. We conclude that expression of the alpha 1(I) collagen gene is controlled by several intronic elements that function coordinately with 5'-flanking and promoter elements."

https://openalex.org/W1483970101,"The sulfate activation locus of Escherichia coli K12 has been cloned by complementation. The genes and gene products of this locus have been characterized by correlating the enzyme activity, complementation patterns, and polypeptides associated with subclones of the cloned DNA. The enzymes of the sulfate activation pathway, ATP sulfurylase (ATP:sulfate adenylyltransferase, EC 2.7.7.4) and APS kinase (ATP:adenosine-5'-phosphosulfate 3'-phosphotransferase, EC 2.7.1.25) have been overproduced approximately 100-fold. Overproduction of ATP sulfurylase requires the expression of both the cysD gene, encoding a 27-kDa polypeptide, and a previously unidentified gene, denoted cysN, which encodes a 62-kDa polypeptide. Purification of ATP sulfurylase to homogeneity reveals that the enzyme is composed of two types of subunits which are encoded by cysD and cysN. Insertion of a kanamycin resistance gene into plasmid or chromosomal cysN prevents sulfate activation and decreases expression of the downstream cysC gene. cysC appears to be the APS kinase structural gene and encodes a 21-kDa polypeptide. The genes are adjacent and are transcribed counterclockwise on the E. coli chromosome in the order cysDNC. cysN and cysC are within the same operon and cysDNC are not in an operon containing cysHIJ."

https://openalex.org/W1995489647,"The yeast retrotransposon Ty can be used to insert multiple copies of a gene at new sites in the genome. The gene of interest is inserted into a GALI-Ty fusion construct; the entire ""amplification cassette"" is then introduced into yeast on a high copy number plasmid vector. Transposition of the Ty element carrying the gene occurs at multiple sites in the genome. Two genes, a bacterial neomycin phosphotransferase gene and the yeast TRPl gene, were amplified in this way. Although the amplified genes were about 1 kilobase in length, they were amplified to about the same extent as a 40-base pair segment. The benefit of this ""shotgun"" approach is that amplification can be achieved in one set of manipulations."
https://openalex.org/W2021794665,We have examined nucleosome positioning on two DNA segments containing sharp sequence-directed curvatures. A 223 bp DNA from Crithidia fasciculata was cloned into two sites in pBR325 separated by 28%. These sites were found to selectively reconstitute nucleosomes 5- to 7-fold more effectively than the adjoining straight DNA. The terminus of replication and termini of transcription of SV40 DNA are contained within a region of approximately 200 bp centrally located in a 1216 bp fragment. Visualization of this fragment by electron microscopy revealed a sharp curve of approximately 200 degrees in the terminal region. Reconstitution of histone protein with this fragment revealed a 2- to 5-fold higher probability of assembling nucleosomes in the terminal region over the adjacent DNA.
https://openalex.org/W1566443303,"Ubiquitin, a small 76-amino acid protein which is highly conserved in eukaryotic cells, occurs in several forms other than the free polypeptide. Among these are protein conjugates in which ubiquitin is covalently linked in lysylpeptide bond to lysl residues of other proteins and fusion proteins in which the amino-terminal domain is the precise ubiquitin sequence. Ubiquitin plays a role in cellular proteolytic degradation and in chromatin structure and has been postulated to be involved in the induction of a set of proteins which function during the cellular response to various kinds of environmental stress. We have measured the various forms of ubiquitin in cultures of chicken embryo fibroblasts under normal growth conditions and after treatment with a thermal or chemical stress. Levels of free ubiquitin fell slightly, ubiquitin conjugate levels rose shortly after stress began, and both then increased substantially as one of the cell's ubiquitin-encoding genes was activated by stress. The level of a protein synthesized as the carboxyl-terminal domain of one ubiquitin fusion protein was unchanged by a heat stress. The most dramatic effect was seen in the rapid disappearance of the ubiquitinated form of histone H2A, one of the major ubiquitin conjugates in cells in the interphase portion of their growth cycle. A significant rise in protein turnover was detected as a result of the stress, but occurred only when cells were removed from the stress condition. These results suggest that ubiquitin plays an important role both during and after stress, but fails to support hypotheses for ubiquitin and proteolysis in the activation of stress genes."
https://openalex.org/W295479257,"We have already determined the primary structure of the endogenous inhibitor for calcium-dependent protease (CANP inhibitor, calpastatin) from the cDNA sequence and revealed that the CANP inhibitor contains four internally repeating units which could be responsible for its multiple reactive sites (Emori, Y., Kawasaki, H., Imajoh, S., Imahori, K., and Suzuki, K. (1987) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 84, 3590-3594). Restriction fragments of the cDNA corresponding to each of the four domains (encoding 104-156 amino acid residues of the total 718 residues) were subcloned into the multicloning site of pUC9 or pUC18 in a direction and frame matched to the lacZ' open reading frame of the vector. Under the lac operator-promoter system, we succeeded in producing truncated fragments of the CANP inhibitor in Escherichia coli. The CANP inhibitor fragments were partially purified, and the inhibitory activities toward calcium-dependent protease (CANP) were examined. All fragments containing well conserved regions of about 30 amino acid residues (domains I-IV) located in the middle of the four units exhibited the inhibitory activity. However, their inhibitory activities varied considerably. Further truncation experiments revealed that small fragments containing 30-70 amino acid residues of the CANP inhibitor still retained inhibitory activity. From these experimental results the following conclusions can be drawn: 1) each of the four repeating units of the CANP inhibitor (about 140 amino acid residues) is a real functional unit and can inhibit CANP activity independently; and 2) domains corresponding to well conserved sequences of about 30 amino acid residues containing a consensus Thr-Ile-Pro-Pro-X-Tyr-Arg sequence are essential for the inhibitory activity, and the bordering regions are important for its modulation."
https://openalex.org/W1480149069,"A kainic acid receptor was purified from Triton X-100/digitonin-solubilized frog brain membranes. The purification was carried out in two steps: ion exchange chromatography using DEAE-Sepharose CL-6B and affinity chromatography with domoic acid immobilized on Sepharose 4B. The specific binding activity of the affinity-purified receptor is 481-fold higher than that of the crude solubilized preparation and 1617-fold higher than that of the whole membrane fraction. Scatchard analyses of the affinity-purified receptor showed a curvilinear plot which fit a two-site model with dissociation constants of 5.5 and 34 nM and Bmax values of 1700 pmol/mg protein and 4400 pmol/mg protein for the high and low affinity components, respectively. The dissociation constants of the purified receptor are similar to those of the crude soluble preparation (4.8 and 39 nM). Inhibition constants for several kainic acid analogs were also similar for the purified and crude preparations. The active purified receptor migrated with a Mr = 570,000 on gel filtration analysis using Sepharose 6B. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the affinity-purified receptor showed a single broad band with silver stain, migrating with a Mr = 48,000."
https://openalex.org/W1541870906,The complete cDNA for human tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) was cloned and sequenced. A mutant was constructed by using in vitro site-specific mutagenesis to delete the region encoding the growth factor domain (amino acids 51-87 inclusive). Normal and mutant t-PA species were produced using two mammalian expression systems (in human HeLa cells and mouse C127 cells). The clearance of mutant and normal t-PA from plasma was examined in vivo using a guinea pig model. Mutant t-PA derived from HeLa or C127 cells was cleared much more slowly than the cognate normal t-PA. The potential role of the growth factor domain in the recognition of t-PA by the hepatic clearance mechanism is discussed.
https://openalex.org/W1542485314,"A monoclonal antibody directed against the Ca2+-requiring proteinase (calpain) of human neutrophils was employed to assess the role of this proteinase in mediating the responses to stimuli such as phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate or fMet-Leu-Phe. In the presence of either phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate or fMet-Leu-Phe the antibody is taken up by the neutrophils, and a marked inhibition of intracellular calpain is observed. The decreased calpain activity is accompanied by (a) a significant decrease in the proteolytic conversion of native protein kinase C (Ca2+/phospholipid-dependent enzyme) to the soluble form that does not require Ca2+ or phospholipids for activity; (b) a marked increase in the production of superoxide anion; and (c) a decrease in the exocytosis of granule contents. The increase in superoxide production can be attributed to a more prolonged association of native protein kinase C with the plasma membrane, thus enhancing the phosphorylation of membrane proteins that precedes O(2-) production (Pontremoli, S., Melloni, E., Salamino, F., Sparatore, B., Michetti, M., Sacco, O., and Horecker, B. L. (1986), Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 140, 1121-1126). The decreased exocytosis can be attributed to a decreased phosphorylation of certain cytoskeletal proteins, catalyzed by the soluble form of protein kinase C (Pontremoli, S., Melloni, E., Michetti, M., Sparatore, B., Salamino, F., Sacco, O., and Horecker, B. L. (1987) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 84, 3604-3608); the subsequent reorganization of the cytoskeleton appears to be related to degranulation. These effects of the monoclonal anti-calpain provide direct evidence for an essential role for calpain in the activation of human neutrophils."
https://openalex.org/W1539067228,"Incubation of stimulated neutrophils with sulfhydryl (RSH) compounds or ascorbic acid (ascorbate) results in rapid superoxide (O2-)-dependent oxidation of these reducing agents. Oxidation of RSH compounds to disulfides (RSSR) is faster than the rate of O2- production by the neutrophil NADPH-oxidase, whereas about one ascorbate is oxidized per O2-. Ascorbate is oxidized to dehydroascorbate, which is also oxidized but at a slower rate. Oxidation is accompanied by a large increase in oxygen (O2) uptake that is blocked by superoxide dismutase. Lactoferrin does not inhibit, indicating that ferric (Fe3+) ions are not required, and Fe3+-lactoferrin does not catalyze RSH or ascorbate oxidation. Two mechanisms contribute to oxidation: 1) O2- oxidizes ascorbate or reduced glutathione and is reduced to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), which also oxidizes the reductants. O2- reacts directly with ascorbate, but reduced glutathione oxidation is mediated by the reaction of O2- with manganese (Mn2+). The H2O2-dependent portion of oxidation is mediated by myeloperoxidase-catalyzed oxidation of chloride to hypochlorous acid (HOCl) and oxidation of the reductants by HOCl. 2) O2- initiates Mn2+-dependent auto-oxidation reactions in which RSH compounds are oxidized and O2 is reduced. Part of this oxidation is due to the RSH-oxidase activity of myeloperoxidase. This activity is blocked by superoxide dismutase but does not require O2- production by the NADPH-oxidase, indicating that myeloperoxidase produces O2- when incubated with RSH compounds. It is proposed that an important role for O2- in the cytotoxic activities of phagocytic leukocytes is to participate in oxidation of reducing agents in phagolysosomes and the extracellular medium. Elimination of these protective agents allows H2O2 and products of peroxidase/H2O2/halide systems to exert cytotoxic effects."

https://openalex.org/W1493290318,"Abstract A 1.5-kilobase cDNA clone for human pyruvate dehydrogenase E1 was isolated from a lambda gt11 expression library by screening with polyclonal antiserum to the E1 alpha subunit of the porcine pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, a polyclonal antibody against bovine pyruvate dehydrogenase complex and a synthetic oligonucleotide based on the known amino acid sequence of the amino-terminal of the bovine pyruvate dehydrogenase-E1 alpha subunit. Nucleotide sequence analysis of the cDNA revealed a 5'-untranslated sequence of 72 nucleotides, a translated sequence of 1170 nucleotides, and a 3'-untranslated sequence of 223 nucleotides with a poly(A) tail. The cDNA structure predicts a leader sequence of 29 amino acids and a mature protein of 362 amino acids comprising an amino-terminal peptide identical to that of the bovine E1 alpha subunit and three serine phosphorylation sites whose sequence was also identical to those in the bovine E1 alpha subunit. The translated sequence for the mature protein differs substantially from that described by Dahl et al. (Dahl, H. H., Hunt, S. M., Hutchison, W. M., and Brown, G. K. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 7398-7403) by virtue of a frameslip between bases 390 and 594. This amended sequence is confirmed by the presence of additional restriction sites for the enzymes NaeI and HaeII at the beginning and end, respectively, of this section. The leader sequence is typical for mitochondrial enzymes being composed of a combination of neutral and basic residues. The amino acid composition is strikingly similar to that of the bovine protein. This cDNA clone hybridizes with a 1.8-kilobase mRNA on a Northern blot analysis of human fibroblasts, and a second minor band of 4.4 kilobases is also detected."

https://openalex.org/W1535624359,"1-Alkyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycerol (alkylacetyl-G) is an important intermediate in the biosynthesis of 1-alkyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (platelet-activating factor) from 1-alkyl-2-lyso-sn-glycero-3-phosphate (alkyllyso-GP) via the de novo pathway. In the present investigation, we have characterized a 1-alkyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphate (alkylacetyl-GP) phosphohydrolase in rat spleens that catalyzes the conversion of alkylacetyl-GP to alkylacetyl-G. The bulk of the enzymatic activity (53%) is located in the microsomal fraction, whereas 28% of the activity is present in mitochondria. The microsomal enzyme has an optimal pH of 7.0-7.4, an apparent Km of 31.8 microM for alkylacetyl-GP, and is widely distributed in various rat tissues. Studies of alkylacetyl-GP phosphohydrolase with respect to substrate specificity, pH profiles, sensitivities to temperature, and effects of detergent, ethanol, or cations indicate the activity of this enzyme can be distinguished from the activities of a nonspecific phosphomonoesterase or phosphatidate phosphohydrolase. Like alkyllyso-GP:acetyl-CoA acetyltransferase, the alkylacetyl-GP phosphohydrolase shows no notable substrate selectivities with regard to variations in alkyl chain length (C16:0 versus C18:0) at the sn-1 position or short chain acyl groups (C2:0 to C6:0, with the exception of C3:0) at the sn-2 position of the glycerol moiety. The enzymatic activity of alkylacetyl-GP phosphohydrolase is 30-90-fold higher than alkyllyso-GP:acetyl-CoA acetyltransferase in most tissues examined. Even though alkyllyso-GP is a substrate for alkyllyso-GP:acetyl-CoA acetyltransferase, it can also be degraded by alkylacetyl-GP phosphohydrolase. Thus, our findings coupled with earlier results imply that specificities of the molecular species of platelet-activating factor synthesized de novo are determined by the enzyme involved in the final step of this pathway, the dithiothreitol-insensitive alkylacetyl-G:CDP-choline cholinephosphotransferase. Furthermore, alkyl-lyso-GP:acetyl-CoA acetyltransferase appears to be the rate-limiting step in the de novo synthesis of alkylacetyl-G."
https://openalex.org/W2007525458,"Activated Xenopus eggs show periodic surface contraction waves and oscillations in endogenous protein phosphorylation, MPF, and kinase activities timed with the cleavage cycle of control fertilized eggs. In this paper, we show that in activated eggs lacking the material that originates from the oocyte nucleus, MPF and kinase oscillations occur in the absence of surface contraction waves. Two mitotic phosphoproteins (M116 and M46), previously described by 32P labeling in nucleated eggs, are no longer detected in the enucleated eggs. We conclude that a cytoplasmic temporal control of MPF and kinase activities is likely to be the essential cell cycle oscillator. The oocyte nuclear components normally stored in the cytoplasm of the embryos are not involved in the clock although they appear to be required for the generation of surface contraction waves."

Scatchard analysis indicates that there are approximately 2 X 10(6) binding sites/cell with a binding efficiency (Kd) of 8 X 10(-9) M. Binding of tropoelastin to cells and membranes reached equilibrium by 90 min and was reversible with 50% of specifically bound material released by 40 min. Specific binding of tropoelastin to cells pre-treated with dilute trypsin solutions was reduced significantly when compared with controls. Four polypeptides of estimated molecular masses of 67, 61, 55, and 43 kDa were obtained from detergent extracts of plasma membranes by elution affinity chromatography on elastin-Affi-Gel. Our findings establish that elastin-specific binding proteins displaying characteristics of a true receptor are present on the surface of elastin-producing cells."
https://openalex.org/W1598635760,"Genomic DNA containing the protein coding region for Drosophila cAMP-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit has been cloned and sequenced. The probe used to detect and isolate the gene fragment was constructed from two partially complementary synthetic oligonucleotides and contains 60 base pairs that encode (using Drosophila codon preferences) amino acids 195-214 of the beef heart catalytic subunit. In reduced stringency hybridization conditions, the probe recognizes two target sites in fly genomic DNA with 85% homology. One of these sites is in the cAMP-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit gene, which was isolated as a 3959-base pair HindIII fragment. This fragment contains all of the protein coding portion, 900 base pairs upstream of the initiator ATG, and 2000 base pairs downstream of the termination codon (TAG). The coding portion of the gene contains no introns and yields a protein of 352 amino acids. There is a 2-amino acid insertion near the N terminus of the fly protein relative to the beef and mouse enzymes. Of the remaining 350 amino acids, 273 are invariant in the three species. A probe derived from the coding sequence of the HindIII clone hybridizes strongly to a 5100-base poly(A)+ RNA and weakly to 4100- and 3400-base poly(A)+ RNAs expressed in adult flies. A 2100-base pair EcoRI genomic fragment containing the second site recognized by the 60-base pair probe has also been cloned. DNA sequence analysis demonstrates that this fragment is part of the cGMP-dependent protein kinase gene or a close homolog. The catalytic subunit gene and the cGMP-dependent protein kinase gene have been located in regions 30C and 21D, respectively, of chromosome 2."
https://openalex.org/W1493994189,"We have developed a homologous cell-free transcription system using extracts from the porcine kidney cell line LLC-PK1 to study the molecular mechanisms by which cAMP regulates urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) gene transcription. We demonstrated accurate initiation of transcription using a cloned fragment of the uPA gene as template. The in vitro transcription rate was stimulated by up to 10-fold by the addition of cAMP (greater than 10 microM). This effect of cAMP on the transcription was greater for closed circular than for linear templates. Furthermore, addition of the purified catalytic subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase stimulated the in vitro transcription in the absence of cAMP to levels 2-fold higher than those observed with cAMP. Addition of cAMP had no stimulatory effect on the transcription of the rat heme oxygenase gene promoter tested under identical conditions. HeLa whole cell extract by itself showed no stimulation of transcription of the uPA gene by cAMP. Results of reconstitution experiments using HeLa whole cell extracts and nuclear lysates from LLC-PK1 cells suggest the presence of putative cAMP regulatory factor(s) as well as general transcription factor(s) in the nucleus of LLC-PK1 cells. These results provide experimental evidence directly implicating cAMP-dependent protein kinase in the regulation of gene transcription."
https://openalex.org/W1571106259,"Site-directed mutagenesis was used to replace the lysine residues of the avian retrovirus nucleocapsid protein pp 12 that have previously been shown to be important for RNA binding. Single amino acid substitutions at Lys-36, -37, and -39 of the protein were not sufficient to affect virus production as measured by reverse transcriptase activity in virus particles released from transfected cells. However, when Lys-36 and Lys-37 were simultaneously replaced by isoleucine residues, there was a complete block of viral replication. As expected from the single mutant analyses, the wild type phenotype could be restored by reverting either or both of the isoleucine residues to lysine residues. Analysis of a bacterially produced rp 12 protein containing Ile-36 and Ile-37 indicated that the protein has a low affinity binding for RNA, as compared to wild type protein. Unlike wild type, the binding is independent of phosphorylation at Ser-40, the major site of phosphorylation of the protein in vivo. A quail cell line was established that expresses virus particles containing the doubly mutated pp 12. Analysis of these particles indicated that they lack viral RNA. Thus, the binding defect in pp 12 is correlated with the inability to package viral RNA."
https://openalex.org/W1656580672,"The generation of platelet-activating factor (PAF) in response to complement-coated zymosan particles, ionophore A23187 and 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (TPA) was studied in human polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN). TPA was an active stimulator of PAF biosynthesis but showed a time course more protracted than that observed in response to other secretagogues. TPA was not found to activate acetyl-CoA:lyso-PAF acetyltransferase activity nor to significantly enhance the incorporation of either [3H] lyso-PAF or [3H]acetate into a lipid fraction co-migrating as PAF. To assess whether TPA could be a secretagogue that promotes the biosynthesis of PAF through the dithiothreitol-insensitive cholinephosphotransferase pathway, this enzymic activity was assayed in homogenates from PMN preincubated in the presence of several secretagogues. None of the agonists was found to enhance this enzyme activity. However, TPA did enhance the incorporation of [methyl-3H]choline and both alkyl- and acetyl-labeled 1-O-hexadecyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycerol into a lipid fraction co-migrating with PAF. This incorporation showed a time course parallel to that of the generation of PAF in response to TPA. Incubation of [methyl-3H]choline-labeled cells in the presence of 1-O-hexadecyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycerol caused an enhanced incorporation of the label into the fraction co-migrating as PAF, and this incorporation was synergistically enhanced by TPA. Pulse-chase experiments with choline showed that TPA caused an early accumulation of choline into phosphatidylcholine and PAF rather than into CDP-choline. The present data indicate that TPA is the only agonist that could initiate the biosynthesis of PAF in human PMN through the cholinephosphotransferase pathway and that this process of biosynthesis is regulated at an enzyme step other than dithiothreitol-insensitive cholinephosphotransferase."
https://openalex.org/W2158108870,"The relationship between glycolysis and respiration was examined in a model of pancreatic B-cell dysfunction, namely in tumoral insulin-producing cells of the RINm5F line. A rise in D-glucose concentration from 2.8 to 16.7 mM increased the utilization of D-[5-3H]glucose and production of [14C]lactate from D-[U-14C]glucose, whereas decreasing the oxidation of either D-[U-14C]glucose or D-[6-14C]glucose. Whereas 2.8 mM D-glucose augmented O2 uptake above basal value, a further rise in D-glucose concentration to 16.7 mM decreased respiration, which remained higher, however, than basal value. Whether at low or high concentration, D-glucose exerted a pronounced sparing action upon the oxidation of endogenous nutrients in cells prelabeled with either L-[U-14C]glutamine or [14C]palmitate and, nevertheless, augmented above basal value the rate of lipogenesis, ATP/ADP content, adenylate charge, and cytosolic NADH/NAD+ and NADPH/NADP+ ratios. The generation of ATP resulting from the catabolism of either exogenous D-glucose or endogenous nutrients was not affected by the rise in hexose concentration from 2.8 to 16.7 mM. Thus, in sharp contrast with the situation found in normal islet cells, a rise in D-glucose concentration, instead of stimulating mitochondrial oxidative events, caused, through a Crabtree effect, inhibition of hexose oxidation and O2 consumption in tumoral islet cells."

https://openalex.org/W1488557075,"The major dihydroxy metabolites of arachidonic acid formed by human polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNL) are leukotriene B4 (LTB4), 6-trans-LTB4, and 12-epi-6-trans-LTB4. LTB4, and to a lesser extent its 6-trans isomers, are metabolized to 20-hydroxy products by a hydroxylase in PMNL. We have recently reported the existence of a second pathway involving a reductase which, combined with the hydroxylase, results in the conversion of 6-trans-LTB4 to dihydro-6-trans-LTB4. We have now investigated some of the characteristics of this novel triene reductase pathway in human PMNL and have characterized some of the products and their mechanism of formation. At low substrate concentrations, the major pathway for the initial metabolism of both 6-trans-LTB4 and 12-epi-6-trans-LTB4 is reduction of the conjugated triene chromophore to give dihydro products with single absorption maxima at about 230 nm. Dihydro-6-trans-LTB4 is rapidly converted to its 20-hydroxy metabolite by LTB4 20-hydroxylase. However, 20-hydroxy-6-trans-LTB4 is not a substrate for the reductase. Neither 12-epi-6-trans-LTB4 nor its dihydro metabolite, 5,12-dihydroxy-7,9,14-eicosatrienoic acid, which was identified by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, were very good substrates for the hydroxylase. The dihydro metabolites of 6-trans-LTB4 and 12-epi-6-trans-LTB4 were formed rapidly during the initial phase of the reaction, whereas the corresponding dihydro-20-hydroxy metabolites were formed only after a lag phase. Experiments utilizing deuterium-labeled 12-epi-6-trans-LTB4 indicated that a hydrogen atom is lost from the 5-position of the substrate, suggesting that the initial step in the formation of the dihydro products is the formation of a 5-oxo intermediate. LTB4 is metabolized very rapidly by LTB4 20-hydroxylase in PMNL, and we have not yet identified dihydro products derived from this substance. However, LTB4 strongly inhibits the conversion of 12-epi-6-trans-LTB4 to dihydro products, suggesting that it may also interact with the reductase."
https://openalex.org/W1574705668,"There is evidence that the gene for the B isozyme of creatine kinase is regulated during cell differentiation, is under hormonal control, and is activated in a small cell lung carcinoma. In order to investigate further the mechanisms of these processes, the human gene was isolated and the structure of the promoter region was determined. A human DNA fragment of 8 kilobase pairs was shown to encompass the entire coding region and 850 base pairs (bp) of the 5'-flanking sequence. This fragment was transfected into three cell lines and shown to express functional enzyme. The 5'-end of the gene is split by a 230-bp intron that is located 12 bp upstream of the initiator ATG codon. Transcription initiation occurs at a site that is approximately 69 bp upstream of the 5'-end of this intron. The DNA sequence in the region upstream of the 5'-end of the mRNA is suggestive of two superimposed promoters that contain additional sequence elements that are known to regulate expression of other eukaryote genes. The 5'-region also has a remarkable homology to the overlapping promoters of the adenovirus EIIaE gene. These elements collectively form the basis for initial investigations of how this gene is controlled."
https://openalex.org/W1604501370,"We have characterized the specific binding of human beta-endorphin (1-31) to novel binding sites which are formed in human plasma or serum in the presence of heparin. The formation of the binding sites is temperature-dependent and does not occur in the presence of other anticoagulants, such as sodium-EDTA, sodium-oxalate, or sodium-citrate. The specific binding of 125I-beta H-endorphin to heparin-induced binding sites in human plasma is saturable and reversible. It is not inhibited by morphine or naloxone or by various opioid peptides which share their NH2-terminal opioid-active sequence with beta H-endorphin. In contrast, binding is inhibited by the COOH-terminal beta H-endorphin fragment Gly-Glu indicating that binding is to nonopioid sites. Electroimmunoprecipitation techniques revealed that these binding sites are identical with S protein/vitronectin or derivatives thereof. S protein is a plasma alpha 1-glycoprotein involved in attachment and spreading of cells and also in blood coagulation and complement activation. It is possible that the interaction of beta-endorphin with S protein is of physiological significance."
https://openalex.org/W2104426537,"In order to examine the frequency of nonreciprocal recombination (gene conversion) within the centromere of the yeast chromosome, we constructed strains that contained heterozygous restriction sites in the conserved centromere sequences of chromosome III in addition to heterozygous markers flanking the centromere. One of these markers was the selectable URA3 gene, which was inserted less than one kb from the centromere. We found that meiotic conversion of the URA3 gene occurred at normal frequency (about 2% of unselected tetrads) and that more than one-third of these convertants coconverted the markers within the centromere. In addition, we observed tetrads in which conversion events extended through the centromere to include a marker on the opposite side from URA3. We conclude that meiotic conversion events occur within the centromere at rates similar to other genomic sequences."
https://openalex.org/W1973140480,"Gold-filled Sendai virus envelopes were fused with cell suspensions from the basal forebrain of fetal rat donors, and the resulting gold-labeled cells were transplanted into the neocortex of adult rat recipients. Not only did large numbers of labeled cells remain intact through 3 months in the neocortex, but sizable numbers migrated subcortically to the recipient's lesioned nucleus basalis region (a distance of 4 to 5 millimeters). Since this technique is capable of labeling most transplanted cells for long periods of time, it may be useful in determining the survival, migration, and connectivity of intracerebrally transplanted tissues."
https://openalex.org/W1561049387,"An 11-kilobase EcoRI fragment containing the human apoA-I gene was cloned in the pSV2gpt vector. The recombinant plasmid was then used to transfect a rat myogenic cell line (L6E9) and HeLa cells. Selection and analysis of cell clones resistant to hypoxanthine/aminopterin/thymidine and mycophenolic acid showed that the apoA-I gene is expressed in L6E9 but not in HeLa cells. The apoA-I mRNA transcribed by either the transfected L6E9 or control human liver cell line, HepG2, has a major transcription initiation site located 26 nucleotides downstream from the CATAAA box. The apoA-I synthesized by the L6E9 cells is secreted into the culture medium and is indistinguishable from the apoA-I secreted by HepG2 cells. These results demonstrate that the L6E9 cells contain the necessary factors required for the expression of the apoA-I gene. Further analysis showed that the endogenous rat apoA-I gene is not expressed in L6E9 cells and exists in a hypermethylated configuration. In contrast, the exogenous human apoA-I gene was found to be hypomethylated in the transfected L6E9 cells and in other apoA-I-producing cells. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that the expression of the endogenous rat apoA-I gene in L6E9 cells is prevented by hypermethylation, suggesting that compared to other mechanisms which control initiation of transcription, DNA methylation may play a higher hierarchical role in the regulation of expression of eukaryotic genes."
https://openalex.org/W1486926259,"The ATP analog arylazido-ATP 5'-triphosphate) (3'-O-(3-[N-(4-azido-2-nitrophenyl)amino]propionyl)adenosine 5'-triphosphate) was shown to phosphorylate the calcium-ATPase from sarcoplasmic reticulum in the absence of calcium. Levels of 0.6 nmol of phosphoenzyme/mg of protein were attained. Calcium either at micromolar or millimolar concentrations did not affect the level of phosphoenzyme. A non-Michaelian dependence of the hydrolytic activity as a function of analog concentration was obtained in the absence of calcium. Calcium addition did not modify either the analog concentration dependence for the activation of hydrolysis or the maximal rate of hydrolysis. In the presence of micromolar calcium, arylazido-ATP promoted calcium accumulation inside the vesicles, and a steady-state level of 100 nmol of calcium/mg of protein was maintained. ESR spectra of spin-labeled ATPase showed that addition of the analog in the absence of calcium caused a spectral change, and the resulting spectral parameters were different from those obtained for ATP under similar conditions. Calcium addition did not cause any further modification of the spectra, which was clearly distinct from the change when ATP was used. The partition coefficient of the analog from a water medium into an organic phase was found to be 1 order of magnitude higher than that of ATP. It is suggested that it might be the hydrophobic nature of the analog which makes it bypass the calcium requirement for utilization of the substrate by the ATPase."
