https://openalex.org/W2805302875,"We describe results from IMmotion150, a randomized phase 2 study of atezolizumab (anti-PD-L1) alone or combined with bevacizumab (anti-VEGF) versus sunitinib in 305 patients with treatment-naive metastatic renal cell carcinoma. Co-primary endpoints were progression-free survival (PFS) in intent-to-treat and PD-L1+ populations. Intent-to-treat PFS hazard ratios for atezolizumab + bevacizumab or atezolizumab monotherapy versus sunitinib were 1.0 (95% confidence interval (CI), 0.69-1.45) and 1.19 (95% CI, 0.82-1.71), respectively; PD-L1+ PFS hazard ratios were 0.64 (95% CI, 0.38-1.08) and 1.03 (95% CI, 0.63-1.67), respectively. Exploratory biomarker analyses indicated that tumor mutation and neoantigen burden were not associated with PFS. Angiogenesis, T-effector/IFN-γ response, and myeloid inflammatory gene expression signatures were strongly and differentially associated with PFS within and across the treatments. These molecular profiles suggest that prediction of outcomes with anti-VEGF and immunotherapy may be possible and offer mechanistic insights into how blocking VEGF may overcome resistance to immune checkpoint blockade."
https://openalex.org/W2806895459,"Immunotherapy using either checkpoint blockade or the adoptive transfer of antitumor lymphocytes has shown effectiveness in treating cancers with high levels of somatic mutations-such as melanoma, smoking-induced lung cancers and bladder cancer-with little effect in other common epithelial cancers that have lower mutation rates, such as those arising in the gastrointestinal tract, breast and ovary1-7. Adoptive transfer of autologous lymphocytes that specifically target proteins encoded by somatically mutated genes has mediated substantial objective clinical regressions in patients with metastatic bile duct, colon and cervical cancers8-11. We present a patient with chemorefractory hormone receptor (HR)-positive metastatic breast cancer who was treated with tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) reactive against mutant versions of four proteins-SLC3A2, KIAA0368, CADPS2 and CTSB. Adoptive transfer of these mutant-protein-specific TILs in conjunction with interleukin (IL)-2 and checkpoint blockade mediated the complete durable regression of metastatic breast cancer, which is now ongoing for >22 months, and it represents a new immunotherapy approach for the treatment of these patients."
https://openalex.org/W2761459232,"Topological states of matter are characterized by topological invariants, which are physical quantities whose values are quantized and do not depend on the details of the system (such as its shape, size and impurities). Of these quantities, the easiest to probe is the electrical Hall conductance, and fractional values (in units of e2/h, where e is the electronic charge and h is the Planck constant) of this quantity attest to topologically ordered states, which carry quasiparticles with fractional charge and anyonic statistics. Another topological invariant is the thermal Hall conductance, which is harder to measure. For the quantized thermal Hall conductance, a fractional value in units of κ0 (κ0 = π2kB2/(3h), where kB is the Boltzmann constant) proves that the state of matter is non-Abelian. Such non-Abelian states lead to ground-state degeneracy and perform topological unitary transformations when braided, which can be useful for topological quantum computation. Here we report measurements of the thermal Hall conductance of several quantum Hall states in the first excited Landau level and find that the thermal Hall conductance of the 5/2 state is compatible with a half-integer value of 2.5κ0, demonstrating its non-Abelian nature."
https://openalex.org/W2799119185,"A central goal of HIV-1 vaccine research is the elicitation of antibodies capable of neutralizing diverse primary isolates of HIV-1. Here we show that focusing the immune response to exposed N-terminal residues of the fusion peptide, a critical component of the viral entry machinery and the epitope of antibodies elicited by HIV-1 infection, through immunization with fusion peptide-coupled carriers and prefusion stabilized envelope trimers, induces cross-clade neutralizing responses. In mice, these immunogens elicited monoclonal antibodies capable of neutralizing up to 31% of a cross-clade panel of 208 HIV-1 strains. Crystal and cryoelectron microscopy structures of these antibodies revealed fusion peptide conformational diversity as a molecular explanation for the cross-clade neutralization. Immunization of guinea pigs and rhesus macaques induced similarly broad fusion peptide-directed neutralizing responses, suggesting translatability. The N terminus of the HIV-1 fusion peptide is thus a promising target of vaccine efforts aimed at eliciting broadly neutralizing antibodies. An alternative HIV vaccine design facilitates generation of HIV-1-antibodies, with promising neutralization breadth in rodents and nonhuman primates."
https://openalex.org/W2807009254,"All measurements of cosmic star formation must assume an initial distribution of stellar masses—the stellar initial mass function—in order to extrapolate from the star-formation rate measured for typically rare, massive stars (of more than eight solar masses) to the total star-formation rate across the full stellar mass spectrum 1 . The shape of the stellar initial mass function in various galaxy populations underpins our understanding of the formation and evolution of galaxies across cosmic time 2 . Classical determinations of the stellar initial mass function in local galaxies are traditionally made at ultraviolet, optical and near-infrared wavelengths, which cannot be probed in dust-obscured galaxies2,3, especially distant starbursts, whose apparent star-formation rates are hundreds to thousands of times higher than in the Milky Way, selected at submillimetre (rest-frame far-infrared) wavelengths4,5. The 13C/18O isotope abundance ratio in the cold molecular gas—which can be probed via the rotational transitions of the 13CO and C18O isotopologues—is a very sensitive index of the stellar initial mass function, with its determination immune to the pernicious effects of dust. Here we report observations of 13CO and C18O emission for a sample of four dust-enshrouded starbursts at redshifts of approximately two to three, and find unambiguous evidence for a top-heavy stellar initial mass function in all of them. A low 13CO/C18O ratio for all our targets—alongside a well tested, detailed chemical evolution model benchmarked on the Milky Way 6 —implies that there are considerably more massive stars in starburst events than in ordinary star-forming spiral galaxies. This can bring these extraordinary starbursts closer to the ‘main sequence’ of star-forming galaxies 7 , although such main-sequence galaxies may not be immune to changes in initial stellar mass function, depending on their star-formation densities. Observations of 13CO and C18O emission from four dusty starburst galaxies at redshifts of approximately two to three reveal that massive stars are more numerous in starburst events than in ordinary star-forming spiral galaxies."
https://openalex.org/W2806844404,"Transcriptional enhancers function as docking platforms for combinations of transcription factors (TFs) to control gene expression. How enhancer sequences determine nucleosome occupancy, TF recruitment and transcriptional activation in vivo remains unclear. Using ATAC–seq across a panel of Drosophila inbred strains, we found that SNPs affecting binding sites of the TF Grainy head (Grh) causally determine the accessibility of epithelial enhancers. We show that deletion and ectopic expression of Grh cause loss and gain of DNA accessibility, respectively. However, although Grh binding is necessary for enhancer accessibility, it is insufficient to activate enhancers. Finally, we show that human Grh homologs—GRHL1, GRHL2 and GRHL3—function similarly. We conclude that Grh binding is necessary and sufficient for the opening of epithelial enhancers but not for their activation. Our data support a model positing that complex spatiotemporal expression patterns are controlled by regulatory hierarchies in which pioneer factors, such as Grh, establish tissue-specific accessible chromatin landscapes upon which other factors can act. The authors show that the transcription factor Grainy head (Grh) is necessary and sufficient for opening of epithelial enhancers, but not for their activation. Grh is shown to function as a pioneer factor, displacing nucleosomes and paving the way for other transcription factors to activate enhancers."
https://openalex.org/W2805791169,"The unusually high demand for metals in the brain, along with insufficient understanding of how their dysregulation contributes to neurological diseases, motivates the study of how inorganic chemistry influences neural circuitry. We now report that the transition metal copper is essential for regulating rest–activity cycles and arousal. Copper imaging and gene expression analysis in zebrafish identifies the locus coeruleus–norepinephrine (LC-NE) system, a vertebrate-specific neuromodulatory circuit critical for regulating sleep, arousal, attention, memory and emotion, as a copper-enriched unit with high levels of copper transporters CTR1 and ATP7A and the copper enzyme dopamine β-hydroxylase (DBH) that produces NE. Copper deficiency induced by genetic disruption of ATP7A, which loads copper into DBH, lowers NE levels and hinders LC function as manifested by disruption in rest–activity modulation. Moreover, LC dysfunction caused by copper deficiency from ATP7A disruption can be rescued by restoring synaptic levels of NE, establishing a molecular CTR1–ATP7A–DBH–NE axis for copper-dependent LC function. Copper contributes to regulating zebrafish rest–activity cycles through the locus coeruleus system by modulating the biosynthesis of norepinephrine; brain copper deficiency leads to lower levels of both synaptic norepinephrine and daytime activity."
https://openalex.org/W2949550946,"Although bioinformatics is becoming increasingly central to research in the life sciences, bioinformatics skills and knowledge are not well integrated into undergraduate biology education. This curricular gap prevents biology students from harnessing the full potential of their education, limiting their career opportunities and slowing research innovation. To advance the integration of bioinformatics into life sciences education, a framework of core bioinformatics competencies is needed. To that end, we here report the results of a survey of biology faculty in the United States about teaching bioinformatics to undergraduate life scientists. Responses were received from 1,260 faculty representing institutions in all fifty states with a combined capacity to educate hundreds of thousands of students every year. Results indicate strong, widespread agreement that bioinformatics knowledge and skills are critical for undergraduate life scientists as well as considerable agreement about which skills are necessary. Perceptions of the importance of some skills varied with the respondent's degree of training, time since degree earned, and/or the Carnegie Classification of the respondent's institution. To assess which skills are currently being taught, we analyzed syllabi of courses with bioinformatics content submitted by survey respondents. Finally, we used the survey results, the analysis of the syllabi, and our collective research and teaching expertise to develop a set of bioinformatics core competencies for undergraduate biology students. These core competencies are intended to serve as a guide for institutions as they work to integrate bioinformatics into their life sciences curricula."
https://openalex.org/W2805369292,"Unsuppressed hepatic glucose production (HGP) contributes substantially to glucose intolerance and diabetes, which can be modeled by the genetic inactivation of hepatic insulin receptor substrate 1 (Irs1) and Irs2 (LDKO mice). We previously showed that glucose intolerance in LDKO mice is resolved by hepatic inactivation of the transcription factor FoxO1 (that is, LTKO mice)-even though the liver remains insensitive to insulin. Here, we report that insulin sensitivity in the white adipose tissue of LDKO mice is also impaired but is restored in LTKO mice in conjunction with normal suppression of HGP by insulin. To establish the mechanism by which white adipose tissue insulin signaling and HGP was regulated by hepatic FoxO1, we identified putative hepatokines-including excess follistatin (Fst)-that were dysregulated in LDKO mice but normalized in LTKO mice. Knockdown of hepatic Fst in the LDKO mouse liver restored glucose tolerance, white adipose tissue insulin signaling and the suppression of HGP by insulin; however, the expression of Fst in the liver of healthy LTKO mice had the opposite effect. Of potential clinical significance, knockdown of Fst also improved glucose tolerance in high-fat-fed obese mice, and the level of serum Fst was reduced in parallel with glycated hemoglobin in obese individuals with diabetes who underwent therapeutic gastric bypass surgery. We conclude that Fst is a pathological hepatokine that might be targeted for diabetes therapy during hepatic insulin resistance."

https://openalex.org/W2806866990,"Bacillus spp. produce a broad spectrum of lipopeptide biosurfactants, among which surfactin, iturin and fengycin are widely studied families. The goals of this study were to characterize the biosurfactant activity of Bacillus spp. and to investigate their motility and biofilm formation capabilities. In addition, we extracted lipopeptides from these bacteria to assess their antifungal activities and analyzed these products by mass spectrometry (MS). B. amyloliquefaciens FZB42, Bacillus sp. NH 217 and B. subtilis NH-100 exhibited excellent biosurfactant and surface spreading activities, whereas B. atrophaeus 176s and Paenibacillus polymyxa C1225 showed moderate activity, and B. subtilis 168 showed no activity. Strains FZB42, NH-100, NH-217, 176s and CC125 exhibited excellent biofilm formation capabilities. Lipopeptide extracts displayed good antifungal activity against various phytopathogens and their associated diseases, such as Fusarium moniliforme (rice bakanae disease), Fusarium oxysporum (root rot), Fusarium solani (root rot) and Trichoderma atroviride (ear rot and root rot). Lipopeptide extracts of these strains also showed hemolytic activity, demonstrating their strong potential to produce surfactants. LCMS-ESI analyses identified the presence of surfactin, iturin and fengycin in the extracts of Bacillus strains. Thus, the strains assayed in this study show potential as biocontrol agents against various Fusarium and Trichoderma species."
https://openalex.org/W2807554198,"In this paper, we propose a novel classification model for automatically identifying individuals with age-related macular degeneration (AMD) or Diabetic Macular Edema (DME) using retinal features from Spectral Domain Optical Coherence Tomography (SD-OCT) images. Our classification method uses retinal features such as the thickness of the retina and the thickness of the individual retinal layers, and the volume of the pathologies such as drusen and hyper-reflective intra-retinal spots. We extract automatically, ten clinically important retinal features by segmenting individual SD-OCT images for classification purposes. The effectiveness of the extracted features is evaluated using several classification methods such as Random Forrest on 251 (59 normal, 177 AMD and 15 DME) subjects. We have performed 15-fold cross-validation tests for three phenotypes; DME, AMD and normal cases using these data sets and achieved accuracy of more than 95% on each data set with the classification method using Random Forrest. When we trained the system as a two-class problem of normal and eye with pathology, using the Random Forrest classifier, we obtained an accuracy of more than 96%. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) finds a value of 0.99 for each dataset. We have also shown the performance of four state-of-the-methods for classification the eye participants and found that our proposed method showed the best accuracy."
https://openalex.org/W2805964580,"Accurate characterization of morphological variation is crucial for generating reliable results and conclusions concerning changes and differences in form. Despite the prevalence of landmark-based geometric morphometric (GM) data in the scientific literature, a formal treatment of whether sampled landmarks adequately capture shape variation has remained elusive. Here, I introduce LaSEC (Landmark Sampling Evaluation Curve), a computational tool to assess the fidelity of morphological characterization by landmarks. This task is achieved by calculating how subsampled data converge to the pattern of shape variation in the full dataset as landmark sampling is increased incrementally. While the number of landmarks needed for adequate shape variation is dependent on individual datasets, LaSEC helps the user (1) identify under- and oversampling of landmarks; (2) assess robustness of morphological characterization; and (3) determine the number of landmarks that can be removed without compromising shape information. In practice, this knowledge could reduce time and cost associated with data collection, maintain statistical power in certain analyses, and enable the incorporation of incomplete, but important, specimens to the dataset. Results based on simulated shape data also reveal general properties of landmark data, including statistical consistency where sampling additional landmarks has the tendency to asymptotically improve the accuracy of morphological characterization. As landmark-based GM data become more widely adopted, LaSEC provides a systematic approach to evaluate and refine the collection of shape data––a goal paramount for accumulation and analysis of accurate morphological information."
https://openalex.org/W2805835150,"An accumulating body of experimental evidence has implicated hippocampal replay occurring within sharp wave ripples (SPW-Rs) as crucial for learning and memory in healthy subjects. This raises speculation that neurological disorders impairing memory disrupt either SPW-Rs or their underlying neuronal activity. We report that mice heterozygous for the gene Scn2a, a site of frequent de novo mutations in humans with intellectual disability, displayed impaired spatial memory. While we observed no changes during encoding, to either single place cells or cell assemblies, we identified abnormalities restricted to SPW-R episodes that manifest as decreased cell assembly reactivation strengths and truncated hippocampal replay sequences. Our results suggest that alterations to hippocampal replay content may underlie disease-associated memory deficits."
https://openalex.org/W2806116714,"Background Several studies have shown that long-term survival after acute kidney injury (AKI) is reduced even if there is clinical recovery. However, we recently reported that in septic shock patients those that recover from AKI have survival similar to patients without AKI. Here, we studied a cohort with less severe sepsis to examine the effects of AKI on longer-term survival as a function of recovery by discharge. Methods We analyzed patients with community-acquired pneumonia from the Genetic and Inflammatory Markers of Sepsis (GenIMS) cohort. We included patients who developed AKI (KDIGO stages 2–3) and defined renal recovery as alive at hospital discharge with return of SCr to within 150% of baseline without dialysis. Our primary outcome was survival up to 3 years analyzed using Gray’s model. Results Of the 1742 patients who survived to hospital discharge, stage 2–3 AKI occurred in 262 (15%), of which 111 (42.4%) recovered. Compared to recovered patients, patients without recovery were older (75 ±14 vs 69 ±15 years, p<0.001) and were more likely to have at least stage 1 AKI on day 1 (83% vs 52%, p<0.001). Overall, 445 patients (25.5%) died during follow-up, 23.4% (347/1480) for no AKI, 28% (31/111) for AKI with recovery and 44.3% (67/151) for AKI without recovery. Patients who did not recover had worse survival compared to no AKI (HR range 1.05–2.46, p = 0.01), while recovering patients had similar survival compared to no AKI (HR 1.01, 95%CI 0.69–1.47, p = 0.96). Absence of AKI on day 1, no in-hospital renal replacement therapy (RRT), higher Apache III score and higher baseline SCr were associated with recovery after AKI. Conclusions In patients with sepsis, recovery by hospital discharge is associated with long-term survival similar to patients without AKI."

Here we show that a DENV-specific antibody against the E-dimer epitope (EDE) potently cross-neutralizes ZIKV and provides robust therapeutic efficacy as well as prophylactic efficacy against ZIKV in rhesus monkeys. Viral escape was not detected, suggesting a relatively high bar to escape. These data demonstrate the potential for antibody-based therapy and prevention of ZIKV. A single monoclonal antibody is therapeutic and has prophylactic activity against Zika virus in monkeys."
https://openalex.org/W2806000507,"Objectives Limited studies have investigated geographic accessibility to a nearby community pharmacy for elderly which is an essential determinant of the access to medications and pharmacy services. This research identified pharmacy deserts and investigated availability of different types of community pharmacies and their services for elderly enrolled in a State Pharmaceutical Assistance Program (SPAP). Methods The state of Pennsylvania in the US was used as a case to demonstrate the geographic accessibility to community pharmacy and services for elderly enrolled in SPAP. The locations of community pharmacies and households of elderly enrolled in SPAP were derived from Pharmaceutical Assistance Contract for the Elderly programs’ database. The street addresses were geocoded and the distance to a nearby community pharmacy was calculated for study sample using the haversine formula. The demographic and geographic data were aggregated to Census Tracts and pharmacy deserts were identified using the predefined criteria. Descriptive statistical analysis was used to determine whether there are statistical differences in the socio-demographic profiles and distribution of different types of community pharmacies and their services in pharmacy deserts and non-deserts. This research used hot spot analyses at county level to identify clusters of pharmacy deserts, areas with high concentration of different racial/ethnic groups and clusters of high densities of chain and independent pharmacies. Results The Spatial analysis revealed that 39% and 61% Census Tracts in Pennsylvania were pharmacy deserts and non-deserts respectively (p < 0.001). Pharmacy deserts were found to have significantly more females, married and white elderly and fewer blacks and Hispanics compared to pharmacy non-deserts. Pharmacy deserts had significantly fewer chain and independent pharmacies and less delivery and 24-hour services in pharmacies than pharmacy non-deserts. Hot spot analyses showed that clusters of pharmacy deserts were more concentrated in southcentral, northwest and northeast regions of the state which represent rural areas and overlapped with clusters of high concentration of white individuals. Conclusions The findings suggest that urban-rural inequality, racial/ethnic disparity and differences in availability of pharmacies and their services exist between pharmacy deserts and non-deserts. The methodological approach and analyses used in this study can also be applied to other public health programs to evaluate the coverage and breadth of public health services."

https://openalex.org/W2805514378,"Tumor metastasis is the most common cause of cancer death. Elucidation of the mechanism of tumor metastasis is therefore important in the development of novel, effective anti-cancer therapies to reduce cancer mortality. Interaction between cancer cells and surrounding stromal cells in the tumor microenvironment is a key factor in tumor metastasis. Using a co-culture assay system with human prostate cancer LNCaP cells and primary human prostate stromal cells, we identified epithelial membrane protein 1 (EMP1) as a gene with elevated expression in the cancer cells. The orthotopic injection of LNCaP cells overexpressing EMP1 (EMP1-LNCaP cells) into the prostate of nude mice induced lymph node and lung metastases, while that of control LNCaP cells did not. EMP1-LNCaP cells had higher cell motility and Rac1 activity than control LNCaP cells. These results were also observed in other lines of cancer cells. We newly identified copine-III as an intracellular binding partner of EMP1. Knockdown of copine-III attenuated the increased cell motility and Rac1 activity in EMP1-LNCaP cells. Reduced cell motility and Rac1 activity following knockdown of copine-III in EMP1-LNCaP cells were recovered by re-expression of wild-type copine-III, but not of a copine-III mutant incapable of interacting with EMP1, suggesting the importance of the EMP1–copine-III interaction. Phosphorylated and activated Src and a Rac guanine nucleotide exchange factor Vav2 were found to be involved in the EMP1-induced enhancement of cell motility and Rac1 activation. Moreover, EMP1 was highly expressed in prostate cancer samples obtained from patients with higher Gleason score. These results demonstrate that upregulation of EMP1 significantly increases cancer cell migration that leads to tumor metastasis, suggesting that EMP1 may play an essential role as a positive regulator of tumor metastasis."
https://openalex.org/W2807216425,"Pediatric acute lung injury, usually because of pneumonia, has a mortality rate of more than 20% and an incidence that rivals that of all childhood cancers combined. CD4+ T-cells coordinate the immune response to pneumonia but fail to function robustly among the very young, who have poor outcomes from lung infection. We hypothesized that DNA methylation represses a mature CD4+ T-cell transcriptional program in neonates with pneumonia. Here, we found that neonatal mice (3-4 days old) aspirated with Escherichia coli bacteria had a higher mortality rate than juvenile mice (11-14 days old). Transcriptional profiling with an unsupervised RNA-Seq approach revealed that neonates displayed an attenuated lung CD4+ T-cell transcriptional response to pneumonia compared with juveniles. Unlike neonates, juveniles up-regulated a robust set of canonical T-cell immune response genes. DNA methylation profiling with modified reduced representation bisulfite sequencing revealed 44,119 differentially methylated CpGs, which preferentially clustered around transcriptional start sites and CpG islands. A methylation difference-filtering algorithm detected genes with a high likelihood of differential promoter methylation regulating their expression; these 731 loci encoded important immune response and tissue-protective T-cell pathway components. Disruption of DNA methylation with the hypomethylating agent decitabine induced plasticity in the lung CD4+ T-cell marker phenotype. Altogether, multidimensional profiling suggested that DNA methylation within the promoters of a core set of CD4+ T-cell pathway genes contributes to the hyporesponsive neonatal immune response to pneumonia. These findings also suggest that DNA methylation could serve as a mechanistic target for disease-modifying therapies in pediatric lung infection and injury."
https://openalex.org/W2805349861,"Chronic regional pain syndrome (CRPS) is an inflammatory and neuropathic pain disorder characterized by the involvement of the autonomic nervous system with sensory, autonomic, motor, skin, and bone changes. At present, universally accepted consensus criteria for CRPS are not yet established, despite the diagnostic criteria proposed by the International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP). Various hypotheses for the pathophysiology of CRPS have been proposed; as a result, current therapeutic modalities are varied. General epidemiological data on CRPS are necessary for effective management. However, recent data on the epidemiology of CRPS in Korea are scarce. The aim of this study was to evaluate the incidence and other epidemiological features of CRPS in the general population in Korea. In this study on the epidemiology of CRPS in Korea, population-based medical data acquired from 51,448,491 subscribers to the National Health Insurance Service (NHIS) from 2011 to 2015 were analyzed, including the incidence, distribution by the CRPS type, regional distribution, monthly distribution, medical costs, and healthcare resource-utilization. The findings indicated that the incidence of CRPS in Korea was 29.0 per 100,000 person-years in 2015 and was correlated with patient age and sex. CRPS types included type I (63%) and type II (37%); moreover, the number of individuals with CRPS I have shown a growing trend since 2011. There was no monthly distribution, but there was regional variation according to the province. The medical departments managing CRPS I the most were orthopedics, internal medicine, anesthesiology and pain medicine, in order; however, patients with CRPS spent more money per visit in the departments of rehabilitation medicine, and anesthesiology and pain medicine. The incidence rate of CRPS in Korea was 29.0 per 100,000 person-years with an increasing trend, which was correlated with patient age in the 70s and female sex. CRPS type I was more common than CRPS type II; in addition, constant increase in medical expenses, regional imbalance, and differences in medical expense among medical specialties should be considered for early management of patients to reduce the disease burden in Korea. Sharing of knowledge about the diagnostic criteria of CRPS are also needed."
https://openalex.org/W2807074642,"Colocation of the genes encoding ABC, TRAP, and TCT transport systems and catabolic pathways for the transported ligand provides a strategy for discovering novel microbial enzymes and pathways. We screened solute-binding proteins (SBPs) for ABC transport systems and identified three that bind D-apiose, a branched pentose in the cell walls of higher plants. Guided by sequence similarity networks (SSNs) and genome neighborhood networks (GNNs), the identities of the SBPs enabled the discovery of four catabolic pathways for D-apiose with eleven previously unknown reactions. The new enzymes include D-apionate oxidoisomerase, which catalyzes hydroxymethyl group migration, as well as 3-oxo-isoapionate-4-phosphate decarboxylase and 3-oxo-isoapionate-4-phosphate transcarboxylase/hydrolase, which are RuBisCO-like proteins (RLPs). The web tools for generating SSNs and GNNs are publicly accessible ( http://efi.igb.illinois.edu/efi-est/ ), so similar 'genomic enzymology' strategies for discovering novel pathways can be used by the community."
https://openalex.org/W2805690929,"Brucellosis is essentially a disease of domesticated livestock; however, humans can also be infected via the consumption of contaminated meat or dairy products, underlying the need for rapid and accurate identification methods. Procedures for microbiological identification and typing of Brucella spp. are expensive, time-consuming, and must be conducted in biohazard containment facilities to minimize operator risk. The development of a matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS)-based assay has reduced the processing time while maintaining performance standards. In this study, to improve the identification accuracy and suitability of the MALDI-TOF-based assay for routine diagnosis, we developed a new protein extraction protocol and generated a custom reference database containing Brucella strains representative of the most widespread species. The reference library was then challenged with blind-coded field samples isolated from infected animals. The results indicated that the database could be used to correctly identify 99.5% and 97% of Brucella strains at the genus and species level, respectively, indicating that the performance of the assay was not affected by the different culture conditions used for microbial isolation. Moreover, the inactivated samples were stored and shipped to reference laboratories with no ill effect on protein stability, thus confirming the reliability of our method for routine diagnosis. Finally, we evaluated the epidemiological value of the protocol by comparing the clustering analysis results of Brucella melitensis strains obtained via multiple locus variable-number tandem repeat analysis or MALDI-TOF MS. The results showed that the MALDI-TOF assay could not decipher the true phylogenetic tree, suggesting that the protein profile did not correspond with the genetic evolution of Brucella."
https://openalex.org/W2806400505,"Remodeling of the extracellular matrix (ECM) in the tumor microenvironment promotes glioma progression. Chondroitin sulfate (CS) proteoglycans appear in the ECM and on the cell surface, and can be catalyzed by dermatan sulfate epimerase to form chondroitin sulfate/dermatan sulfate (CS/DS) hybrid chains. Dermatan sulfate epimerase 1 (DSE) is overexpressed in many types of cancer, and CS/DS chains mediate several growth factor signals. However, the role of DSE in gliomas has never been explored. In the present study, we determined the expression of DSE in gliomas by consulting a public database and conducting immunohistochemistry on a tissue array. Our investigation revealed that DSE was upregulated in gliomas compared with normal brain tissue. Furthermore, high DSE expression was associated with advanced tumor grade and poor survival. We found high DSE expression in several glioblastoma cell lines, and DSE expression directly mediated DS chain formation in glioblastoma cells. Knockdown of DSE suppressed the proliferation, migration, and invasion of glioblastoma cells. In contrast, overexpression of DSE in GL261 cells enhanced these malignant phenotypes and in vivo tumor growth. Interestingly, we found that DSE selectively regulated heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor (HB-EGF)-induced signaling in glioblastoma cells. Inhibiting epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and ErbB2 with afatinib suppressed DSE-enhanced malignant phenotypes, establishing the critical role of the ErbB pathway in regulating the effects of DSE expression. This evidence indicates that upregulation of DSE in gliomas contributes to malignant behavior in cancer cells. We provide novel insight into the significance of DS chains in ErbB signaling and glioma pathogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2806460700,"Acyl-coenzyme A (CoA) ligases catalyze the activation of carboxylic acids via a two-step reaction of adenylation followed by thioesterification. Here, we report the discovery of a non-adenylating acyl-CoA ligase PtmA2 and the functional separation of an acyl-CoA ligase reaction. Both PtmA1 and PtmA2, two acyl-CoA ligases from the biosynthetic pathway of platensimycin and platencin, are necessary for the two steps of CoA activation. Gene inactivation of ptmA1 and ptmA2 resulted in the accumulation of free acid and adenylate intermediates, respectively. Enzymatic and structural characterization of PtmA2 confirmed its ability to only catalyze thioesterification. Structural characterization of PtmA2 revealed it binds both free acid and adenylate substrates and undergoes the established mechanism of domain alternation. Finally, site-directed mutagenesis restored both the adenylation and complete CoA activation reactions. This study challenges the currently accepted paradigm of adenylating enzymes and inspires future investigations on functionally separated acyl-CoA ligases and their ramifications in biology."
https://openalex.org/W2806654121,"Cardiolipin (CL) is a signature phospholipid of the mitochondria required for the formation of mitochondrial respiratory chain (MRC) supercomplexes. The destabilization of MRC supercomplexes is the proximal cause of the pathology associated with the depletion of CL in patients with Barth syndrome. Thus, promoting supercomplex formation could ameliorate mitochondrial dysfunction associated with CL depletion. However, to date, physiologically relevant small-molecule regulators of supercomplex formation have not been identified. Here, we report that ethanolamine (Etn) supplementation rescues the MRC defects by promoting supercomplex assembly in a yeast model of Barth syndrome. We discovered this novel role of Etn while testing the hypothesis that elevating mitochondrial phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), a phospholipid suggested to overlap in function with CL, could compensate for CL deficiency. We found that the Etn supplementation rescues the respiratory growth of CL-deficient Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells in a dose-dependent manner but independently of its incorporation into PE. The rescue was specifically dependent on Etn but not choline or serine, the other phospholipid precursors. Etn improved mitochondrial function by restoring the expression of MRC proteins and promoting supercomplex assembly in CL-deficient cells. Consistent with this mechanism, overexpression of Cox4, the MRC complex IV subunit, was sufficient to promote supercomplex formation in CL-deficient cells. Taken together, our work identifies a novel role of a ubiquitous metabolite, Etn, in attenuating mitochondrial dysfunction caused by CL deficiency. Cardiolipin (CL) is a signature phospholipid of the mitochondria required for the formation of mitochondrial respiratory chain (MRC) supercomplexes. The destabilization of MRC supercomplexes is the proximal cause of the pathology associated with the depletion of CL in patients with Barth syndrome. Thus, promoting supercomplex formation could ameliorate mitochondrial dysfunction associated with CL depletion. However, to date, physiologically relevant small-molecule regulators of supercomplex formation have not been identified. Here, we report that ethanolamine (Etn) supplementation rescues the MRC defects by promoting supercomplex assembly in a yeast model of Barth syndrome. We discovered this novel role of Etn while testing the hypothesis that elevating mitochondrial phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), a phospholipid suggested to overlap in function with CL, could compensate for CL deficiency. We found that the Etn supplementation rescues the respiratory growth of CL-deficient Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells in a dose-dependent manner but independently of its incorporation into PE. The rescue was specifically dependent on Etn but not choline or serine, the other phospholipid precursors.

https://openalex.org/W2806578072,"Dogs living on Bali Island have been free-ranging for thousands of years. A large group of expatriates sometimes adopt Bali dogs and keep them restricted to their houses and backyards, as is typical in modern western cultures. This provides us with the unique opportunity to compare the personality traits of dogs to their lifestyle either living as human companions or as free-ranging animals, exploring at the same time the impact of demographic variables (such as age, sex, and neutered status) on personality. After controlling for internal consistency of the scales and between-observer variation, we found that free-ranging Bali dogs were rated as less active, less excitable, less aggressive towards animals, and less inclined to chase animals or humans than Bali dogs living as human companions. Among free-ranging dogs, females were found to be more excitable. Females in the whole sample were also more fearful of people. The results of this preliminary study suggest that a change in lifestyle, i.e. being adopted, and living in a confined environment has negative consequences on some canine personality traits, such as activity/excitability, aggression towards animals, and prey drive."
https://openalex.org/W2807316934,"Introduction Spatial targeting is advocated as an effective method that contributes for achieving tuberculosis control in high-burden countries. However, there is a paucity of studies clarifying the spatial nature of the disease in these countries. This study aims to identify the location, size and risk of purely spatial and space-time clusters for high occurrence of tuberculosis in Gurage Zone, Southern Ethiopia during 2007 to 2016. Materials and methods A total of 15,805 patient data that were retrieved from unit TB registers were included in the final analyses. The spatial and space-time cluster analyses were performed using the global Moran’s I, Getis-Ord and Kulldorff’s scan statistics. Results Eleven purely spatial and three space-time clusters were detected (P <0.001).The clusters were concentrated in border areas of the Gurage Zone. There were considerable spatial variations in the risk of tuberculosis by year during the study period. Conclusions This study showed that tuberculosis clusters were mainly concentrated at border areas of the Gurage Zone during the study period, suggesting that there has been sustained transmission of the disease within these locations. The findings may help intensify the implementation of tuberculosis control activities in these locations. Further study is warranted to explore the roles of various ecological factors on the observed spatial distribution of tuberculosis."
https://openalex.org/W2805412639,"Glioblastoma is a primary brain tumor with a poor prognosis despite of many treatment regimens. Radiotherapy significantly prolongs patient survival and remains the most common treatment. Slit2 and Robo1 are evolutionarily conserved proteins involved in axon guidance, migration, and branching of neuronal cells. New studies have shown that Slit2 and Robo1 could play important roles in leukocyte chemotaxis and glioblastoma cell migration. Therefore, we investigated whether the Slit2/Robo1 complex has an impact on the motility of glioblastoma cells and whether irradiation with therapeutic doses modulates this effect. Our results indicate that photon irradiation increases the migration of glioblastoma cells in vitro. qPCR and immunoblotting experiments in two different glioblastoma cell lines (U-373 MG and U-87 MG) with different malignancy revealed that both Slit2 and Robo1 are significantly lower expressed in the cell populations with the highest motility and that the expression was reduced after irradiation. Overexpression of Robo1 significantly decreased the motility of glioblastoma cells and inhibited the accelerated migration of wild-type cells after irradiation. Immunoblotting analysis of migration-associated proteins (fascin and focal adhesion kinase) and of the epithelial-mesenchymal-transition-related protein vimentin showed that irradiation affected the migration of glioblastoma cells by increasing vimentin expression, which can be reversed by the overexpression of Slit2 and Robo1. Our findings suggest that Robo1 expression might counteract migration and also radiation-induced migration of glioblastoma cells, a process that might be connected to mesenchymal-epithelial transition."
https://openalex.org/W2806815569,"Background Although epidemiological evidence for the beneficial effect of low alcohol consumption on myocardial infarction is strong, the impact of heavy drinking episodes is less clear. Objectives The aim of this study was to investigate a possible association between the risk for acute myocardial infarction occurrence and alcohol consumption. Methods Our hospital-based case-control study comprised 374 participants (187 newly diagnosed patients with myocardial infarction and 187 controls, individually matched by gender, age, and place of residence). This study was performed in Kragujevac (a city in Serbia) during 2010. Logistic regression analysis was used to determine odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). Results The history of alcohol consumption in patients with acute myocardial infarction and their controls did not differ significantly: the percentage of those that were consuming alcohol was slightly higher in cases (54.5%) than in controls (50.3%). The habit of binge drinking during the previous 12 months was significantly more common in cases (25.1%) than in controls (12.8%): adjusted OR = 2.2 (95%CI = 1.2–4.2, p = 0.017), p for trend = 0.015. Analysis of binge drinking by age, gender and place of residence revealed that the increase in risk for acute myocardial infarction was associated with older age (adjusted OR = 5.1, 95%CI = 1.7–15.1, p for trend = 0.010), male gender (adjusted OR = 2.3, 95%CI = 1.1–5.2, p for trend = 0.028) and rural place of residence (adjusted OR = 4.8, 95%CI = 1.3–18.5, p for trend = 0.033). Conclusion Our results suggest that binge drinking is associated with twice the risk for myocardial infarction compared to not drinking. Since consumption of alcohol is very common in the Serbian population, the effect of binge drinking on myocardial infarction should be considered an important public health issue."
https://openalex.org/W2807278012,"Honey from the European honeybee, Apis mellifera, is produced by α-glucosidases (HBGases) and is widely used in food, pharmaceutical, and cosmetic industries. Categorized by their substrate specificities, HBGases have three isoforms: HBGase I, II and III. Previous experimental investigations showed that wild-type HBGase III from Apis mellifera (WT) preferred sucrose to maltose as a substrate, while the Y227H mutant (MT) preferred maltose to sucrose. This mutant can potentially be used for malt hydrolysis because it can efficiently hydrolyze maltose. In this work, to elucidate important factors contributing to substrate specificity of this enzyme and gain insight into how the Y227H mutation causes substrate specificity change, WT and MT homology models were constructed, and sucrose/maltose was docked into active sites of the WT and MT. AMBER14 was employed to perform three independent molecular dynamics runs for these four complexes. Based on the relative binding free energies calculated by the MM-GBSA method, sucrose is better than maltose for WT binding, while maltose is better than sucrose for MT binding. These rankings support the experimentally observed substrate specificity that WT preferred sucrose to maltose as a substrate, while MT preferred maltose to sucrose, suggesting the importance of binding affinity for substrate specificity. We also found that the Y227H mutation caused changes in the proximities between the atoms necessary for sucrose/maltose hydrolysis that may affect enzyme efficiency in the hydrolysis of sucrose/maltose. Moreover, the per-residue binding free energy decomposition results show that Y227/H227 may be a key residue for preference binding of sucrose/maltose in the WT/MT active site. Our study provides important and novel insight into the binding of sucrose/maltose in the active site of Apis mellifera HBGase III and into how the Y227H mutation leads to the substrate specificity change at the molecular level. This knowledge could be beneficial in the design of this enzyme for increased production of desired products."
https://openalex.org/W2807449069,"Horseshoe crab hemolymph coagulation is believed to be triggered by the autocatalytic activation of serine protease zymogen factor C to the active form, α-factor C, belonging to the trypsin family, through an active transition state of factor C responding to bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS), designated factor C*. However, the existence of factor C* is only speculative, and its proteolytic activity has not been validated. In addition, it remains unclear whether the proteolytic cleavage of the Phe737–Ile738 bond (Phe737 site) of factor C required for the conversion to α-factor C occurs intramolecularly or intermolecularly between the factor C molecules.

Moreover, we found the following facts using several mutants of factor C: the autocatalytic cleavage of factor C occurs intermolecularly between factor C* molecules on the LPS surface; factor C* does not exhibit intrinsic chymotryptic activity against the Phe737 site, but it may recognize a three-dimensional structure around the cleavage site; and LPS is required not only to complete the substrate-binding site and oxyanion hole of factor C* by interacting with the N-terminal region but also to allow the Phe737 site to be cleaved by inducing a conformational change around the Phe737 site or by acting as a scaffold to induce specific protein–protein interactions between factor C* molecules.

The molecular mechanism underlying the proteolytic activation of serine protease zymogens has been established in trypsinogen, which is activated by the activator enteropeptidase through limited proteolysis of the Arg15–Ile16 peptide bond in chymotrypsinogen numbering. The limited proteolysis induces the insertion of the newly appearing N-terminal Ile16 into the activation pocket known as the Ile16 cleft to form a salt bridge between the α-amino group of Ile16 and the β-carboxyl group of Asp194. The salt bridge results in conformational changes in the substrate-binding site and the oxyanion hole to hydrolyze specific peptide bonds of substrates, whereas the conformational changes elsewhere in the molecule, including the catalytic triad of Ser195, His57, and Asp102, are very small (1.Freer S.T.

To ensure that the LPS-dependent autocatalytic cleavage reaction of factor C was accurately quantified by Western blotting under the conditions used, WT factor C was incubated at varying concentrations from 12.5 to 100 nm for 30 min at 37 °C in the presence or absence of LPS and subjected to Western blotting. WT factor C was autocatalytically cleaved in the presence of LPS but not in the absence of LPS (Fig. 2A). The relative band density of Western blotting by densitometric analysis was in direct proportion to the concentration of factor C under these conditions (Fig. 2B). After 30-min incubation with LPS, factor C at every concentration was cleaved by ∼80% under these conditions (Fig. 2C). These results indicate that the LPS-dependent autocatalytic cleavage was quantified by the densitometric analysis of Western blotting, at least under the conditions used. To determine whether the catalytic serine residue in the protease domain of factor C is involved in the autocatalytic activation, the Ser941 residue of factor C, corresponding to Ser195 in chymotrypsinogen numbering, was substituted to Ala (S941A). WT factor C or the S941A mutant was incubated at 37 °C in the presence of LPS and subjected to Western blotting (Fig. 3, A and B). The autocatalytic cleavage rate was quantitated densitometrically (Fig. 3C). As expected, the L chain of WT factor C was converted to the B chain by ∼80% within 30 min under the conditions employed (Fig. 3, A and C), but the appearance of the B chain of the S941A mutant was not detected (Fig. 3, B and C). These results indicate that the Ser941 residue of factor C plays a key role in the LPS-dependent autocatalytic cleavage of the Phe737 site. To examine whether factor C* recognizes the hydrophobic side chain of the Phe737 site, the Phe737 residue was substituted to Ala (F737A), Glu (F737E), Arg (F737R), or Pro (F737P). In addition, to examine whether the side chain of Ile738 affects the cleavage reaction, the Ile738 residue was substituted to Ala (I738A). All of the mutants, except the F737R mutant, were expressed in HEK293S GnTI− cells, but the expression level of the F737R mutant was too low for purification. LPS-dependent autocatalytic cleavage reactions for the P1 mutants (F737A, F737E, and F737P) and the P1′ mutant (I738A) were performed using a concentration of 50 nm for each mutant within the range of the linearity of the densitometric analysis of Western blotting, as shown in Fig. 2 for WT factor C. Each of the mutants was incubated at 37 °C in the presence of LPS and subjected to Western blotting with anti-B chain antibody. All of the mutants, except the F737P mutant, were autocatalytically cleaved in the presence of LPS (Fig. 4, A–D), and more than 70% of the L chain of each mutant was converted into the B chain by the 30-min incubation (Fig. 4E). Interestingly, the F737A mutant was more efficiently cleaved autocatalytically than WT factor C (Fig. 4E). These results suggest that factor C* does not exhibit an intrinsic chymotryptic activity against the Phe737 site and that the side chain of Ile738 has little effect on the proteolytic cleavage of the Phe737 site. The cleaved form of the F737A mutant exhibited high levels of specific amidase activities against Boc–Val–Pro–Arg–pNA, comparable with the levels of WT α-factor C, and the cleaved form of the F737E mutant also had sufficient amidase activity (Fig. 4F). In contrast, the cleaved form of the I738A mutant, corresponding to Ile16 in chymotrypsinogen numbering, exhibited no amidase activity (Fig. 4F), indicating an essential interaction of Ile738 with the Ile16 cleft to induce conversion of the zymogen form to the active form. These data support the previous report of trypsin recombinants with Ile16 mutations, demonstrating that the hydrophobic interaction of the Ile16 side chain is the primary force to stabilize the substrate-binding site and the oxyanion hole rather than the electrostatic interaction of the Asp194–Ile16 salt bridge (24.Hedstrom L. Lin T.Y. Fast W. Hydrophobic interactions control zymogen activation in the trypsin family of serine proteases.Biochemistry. 1996; 35 (8605201): 4515-452310.1021/bi951928kCrossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). As expected, the individual incubation of the F737P mutant or S941A mutant did not result in any detectable amidase activity against the synthetic substrate in the presence of LPS (Fig. 4F). The F737P mutant prevented the cleavage reaction at the Phe737 site in the autocatalytic activation (Fig. 4, C, E, and F), whereas its Ser941 residue remained intact. On the other hand, the S941A mutant lost its authentic serine protease activity (Figs. 3B and 4F), whereas its Phe737 site remained intact. If the autocatalytic cleavage occurs intermolecularly between the factor C* molecules but not intramolecularly within individual molecules of factor C*, then the Phe737 site of the S941A mutant could be cleaved by the proteolytic activity of the active transition state of the F737P mutant bound to LPS. To examine this hypothesis, the F737P and S941A mutants were mixed and incubated for 30 min at different concentration ratios in the presence of LPS, and the aliquots were subjected to Western blotting. First, under conditions of a fixed concentration of the S941A mutant at 50 nm and increasing concentrations of the F737P mutant from 1 to 5 nm, the autocatalytic cleavage rate increased as the concentrations of the F737P mutant increased (Fig. 5, A, left, and B, left). Next, under conditions of a fixed concentration of the F737P mutant at 50 nm and increasing concentrations of the S941A mutant from 1 to 5 nm, the autocatalytic cleavage reaction was not observed (Fig. 5, A, right, and B, right), indicating that the Phe737 site of the S941A mutant is cleaved by the F737P mutant bound to LPS (F737P*). These results also indicate the presence of the active transition state of factor C without cleavage of the Phe737 site. To obtain further evidence for the intermolecular event of autocatalytic activation, a newly developed epitope tag system, PA tag, which is a dodecapeptide derived from human podoplanin and recognized by a high-affinity mAb, NZ-1 (anti-PA antibody) (25.Kato Y. Kaneko M.K. Kuno A. Uchiyama N. Amano K. Chiba Y. Hasegawa Y. Hirabayashi J. Narimatsu H. Mishima K. Osawa M.

Addition of a peptide or an epitope tag to the N terminus of WT factor C inhibits the LPS-dependent autocatalytic activation of factor C (22.Kobayashi Y. Shiga T. Shibata T. Sako M. Maenaka K. Koshiba T. Mizumura H. Oda T. Kawabata S. The N-terminal Arg residue is essential for autocatalytic activation of a lipopolysaccharide-responsive protease zymogen.J. Biol.

In contrast, with the PA tag system it is possible to insert the PA tag into internal portions of a recombinant protein or boundary portions between the domains in a mosaic protein to maintain not only the antigenicity of the PA tag but also the physiologic activities of the tag-containing proteins (26.Fujii Y. Matsunaga Y. Arimori T. Kitago Y. Ogasawara S. Kaneko M.K. Kato Y. Takagi J. Tailored placement of a turn-forming PA tag into the structured domain of a protein to probe its conformational state.J.

Accordingly, the PA tag was inserted into the peptide bond between Trp758–Leu759 in the B chain of WT factor C (PA factor C), corresponding to the linker position between the two β-barrel structures composing the catalytic domain of serine proteases (1.Freer S.T.

To examine the time-dependent cleavage reaction, PA factor C or WT factor C was incubated at 37 °C in the presence of LPS and then subjected to Western blotting with an anti-B chain antibody. The LPS-dependent autocatalytic cleavage of PA factor C occurred in correlation with that of WT factor C (Fig. 6, A and B). On the other hand, the autocatalytically activated PA factor C exhibited ∼30% lower amidase activity against the synthetic peptide substrate compared with that of the WT α-factor C (Fig. 6C), indicating that insertion of the PA tag at this position partially inhibits the amidase activity of α-factor C. The LPS-dependent autocatalytic conversion of PA factor C was monitored on Western blotting using the anti-PA antibody (Fig. 7A); the results corresponded to those by Western blotting with the anti-B chain antibody (Fig. 6A). To confirm that the Phe737 site of the S941A mutant is cleaved by the F737P mutant bound to LPS (Fig. 5), the PA tag was inserted into the Trp758–Leu759 bond of the F737P and S941A mutants, yielding the PA-F737P and PA-S941A mutants, respectively. As anticipated, the resulting PA-F737P and PA-S941A mutants were not autocatalytically converted by individual incubation in the presence of LPS (Fig. 7, A and B). Then, the PA-F737P and S941A mutants were mixed at a 1:1 ratio, incubated in the presence of LPS for 30 min, and subjected to Western blotting with anti-PA antibody. As expected, the L chain of the PA-F737P mutant was not converted to the B chain (Fig. 7C, center lane). Next, Western blotting experiments were carried out using a 1:1 mixture of the PA-S941A and F737P mutants in the presence of LPS, and the B chain derived from the PA-S941A mutant was detected by anti-PA antibody (Fig. 7C, right lane), clearly indicating that the Phe737 site of the PA-S941A mutant is intermolecularly cleaved by the F737P mutant bound to LPS. The N-terminal tripeptide of Arg36–Trp37–Arg38 of factor C is essential for LPS recognition, and the replacement of both Arg36 and Arg38 to Glu (the RE factor C mutant (factor C mutants with the replacement of both Arg36 and Arg38 to Glu)) causes the loss of LPS-binding activity (20.Koshiba T.

We set out to introduce a single base-pair substitution in two intronic SNPs at the FTO locus without altering nearby non-coding sequence. Substitution efficiency increased up to 10-fold by treatment of human embryonic stem cells (ESC) with non-toxic levels of DMSO (1%) before CRISPR/Cas9 delivery. Treatment with DMSO did not result in CRISPR/Cas9 off-target effects or compromise the chromosomal stability of the ESC. Twenty-four hour treatment of human ESC with DMSO before CRISPR/Cas9 delivery may prove a simple means to increase editing efficiency of non-coding DNA without incorporation of undesirable mutations."
https://openalex.org/W2806488847,"The Protein Data Bank (PDB) is the single worldwide archive of experimentally-determined three-dimensional (3D) structures of proteins and nucleic acids. As of January 2017, the PDB housed more than 125,000 structures and was growing by more than 11,000 structures annually. Since the 3D structure of a protein is vital to understand the mechanisms of biological processes, diseases, and drug design, correct oligomeric assembly information is of critical importance. Unfortunately, the biologically relevant oligomeric form of a 3D structure is not directly obtainable by X-ray crystallography, whilst in solution methods (NMR or single particle EM) it is known from the experiment. Instead, this information may be provided by the PDB Depositor as metadata coming from additional experiments, be inferred by sequence-sequence comparisons with similar proteins of known oligomeric state, or predicted using software, such as PISA (Proteins, Interfaces, Structures and Assemblies) or EPPIC (Evolutionary Protein Protein Interface Classifier). Despite significant efforts by professional PDB Biocurators during data deposition, there remain a number of structures in the archive with incorrect quaternary structure descriptions (or annotations). Further investigation is, therefore, needed to evaluate the correctness of quaternary structure annotations. In this study, we aim to identify the most probable oligomeric states for proteins represented in the PDB. Our approach evaluated the performance of four independent prediction methods, including text mining of primary publications, inference from homologous protein structures, and two computational methods (PISA and EPPIC). Aggregating predictions to give consensus results outperformed all four of the independent prediction methods, yielding 83% correct, 9% wrong, and 8% inconclusive predictions, when tested with a well-curated benchmark dataset. We have developed a freely-available web-based tool to make this approach accessible to researchers and PDB Biocurators (http://quatstruct.rcsb.org/)."
https://openalex.org/W2806906356,"Leopard seals are an important Antarctic apex predator that can affect marine ecosystems through local predation. Here we report on the successful use of micro geolocation logging sensor tags to track the movements, and activity, of four leopard seals for trips of between 142-446 days including one individual in two separate years. Whilst the sample size is small the results represent an advance in our limited knowledge of leopard seals. We show the longest periods of tracking of leopard seals' migratory behaviour between the pack ice, close to the Antarctic continent, and the sub-Antarctic island of South Georgia. It appears that these tracked animals migrate in a directed manner towards Bird Island and, during their residency, use this as a central place for foraging trips as well as exploiting the local penguin and seal populations. Movements to the South Orkney Islands were also recorded, similar to those observed in other predators in the region including the krill fishery. Analysis of habitat associations, taking into account location errors, indicated the tracked seals had an affinity for shallow shelf water and regions of sea ice. Wet and dry sensors revealed that seals hauled out for between 22 and 31% of the time with maximum of 74 hours and a median of between 9 and 11 hours. The longest period a seal remained in the water was between 13 and 25 days. Fitting GAMMs showed that haul out rates changed throughout the year with the highest values occurring during the summer which has implications for visual surveys. Peak haul out occurred around midday for the months between October and April but was more evenly spread across the day between May and September. The seals' movements between, and behaviour within, areas important to breeding populations of birds and other seals, coupled with the dynamics of the region's fisheries, shows an understanding of leopard seal ecology is vital in the management of the Southern Ocean resources."
https://openalex.org/W2807617931,"Existing literature outlines the quality and location of activation in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) during working memory (WM) tasks. However, the effects of individual differences on the underlying neural process of WM tasks are still unclear. In this functional near infrared spectroscopy study, we administered a visual and auditory n-back task to examine activation in the PFC while considering the influences of task performance, and preferred learning strategy (VARK score). While controlling for age, results indicated that high performance (HP) subjects (accuracy > 90%) showed task dependent lower activation compared to normal performance subjects in PFC region Specifically HP groups showed lower activation in left dorsolateral PFC (DLPFC) region during performance of auditory task whereas during visual task they showed lower activation in the right DLPFC. After accounting for learning style, we found a correlation between visual and aural VARK score and level of activation in the PFC. Subjects with higher visual VARK scores displayed lower activation during auditory task in left DLPFC, while those with higher visual scores exhibited higher activation during visual task in bilateral DLPFC. During performance of auditory task, HP subjects had higher visual VARK scores compared to NP subjects indicating an effect of learning style on the task performance and activation. The results of this study show that learning style and task performance can influence PFC activation, with applications toward neurological implications of learning style and populations with deficits in auditory or visual processing."

The kinase activity of TRPM7 has been linked to the regulation of a broad range of cellular activities, but little is understood as to how the channel itself is regulated by its own kinase activity. Here, using several mammalian cell lines expressing WT TRPM7 or kinase-inactive variants, we discovered that compared with the cells expressing WT TRPM7, cells in which TRPM7's kinase activity was inactivated had faster degradation, elevated ubiquitination, and increased intracellular retention of the channel. Mutational analysis of TRPM7 autophosphorylation sites further revealed a role for Ser-1360 of TRPM7 as a key residue mediating both TRPM7 stability and intracellular trafficking. Additional trafficking roles were uncovered for Ser-1403 and Ser-1567, whose phosphorylation by TRPM7's kinase activity mediated the interaction of the channel with the signaling protein 14-3-3θ. In summary, our results point to a critical role for TRPM7's kinase activity in regulating proteasome-mediated turnover of the TRPM7 channel and controlling its cellular localization in polarized epithelial cells.

https://openalex.org/W2806347372,"Fossil evidence indicates that modern assemblages of temperate nonmarine planktonic diatoms began near the middle/late Miocene boundary when the genus Actinocyclus, an important constituent of lacustrine planktonic diatom assemblages during the early to middle Miocene, was replaced by genera of the family Stephanodiscaceae. This floral turnover has been confirmed in many regions of the world, except eastern Asia where taxonomic data about early and middle Miocene planktonic diatom assemblages have until recently been scarce. Our analysis of Lower and Middle Miocene lacustrine diatomaceous rocks in Japan confirms that species of nonmarine Actinocyclus were important constituents of lake phytoplankton there as well. The appearance of nonmarine Actinocyclus species near the beginning of the Miocene may have resulted from the introduction of euryhaline species into lacustrine environments during a highstand of sea level at that time. Similarly, it is possible that species of Stephanodiscaceae evolved from marine thalassiosiroid ancestors that invaded high latitude lacustrine environments during multiple Paleogene highstands, resulting in a polyphyletic origin of the family. The turnover from nonmarine Actinocyclus to Stephanodiscaceae genera near the middle/late Miocene boundary may be linked to a contemporaneous increase in silica concentrations in lakes caused by active volcanism, increased weathering of silicate rocks due to orogeny, and the expansion of C4 grasslands. This turnover may also have been influenced by enhanced seasonal environmental changes in the euphotic zone caused by the initiation of monsoon conditions and a worldwide increase in meridional temperature gradients during the late Miocene. Morphological characteristics of Stephanodiscaceae genera, such as strutted processes and small size, suggest their species were better adapted to seasonal environmental changes than nonmarine species of Actinocyclus because of their superiority in floating and drifting capabilities and possibly metabolism, intrinsic growth rate, and reproductivity. As climates deteriorated during the late Miocene, Stephanodiscaceae species may have spread from high latitudes to temperate lakes where they diversified, ultimately displacing Actinocyclus."
https://openalex.org/W2805431039,"Background The widespread use of antiretroviral therapy (ART) has led to considerable concerns about the prevalence of transmitted drug resistance (TDR). Sexual contact, particularly men who have sex with men (MSM) was the most prevalent form of HIV transmission in Shijiazhuang. Hence, we conducted an epidemiological surveillance study on TDR among newly diagnosed individuals who infected-HIV through sexual contact in from 2014–2015. Methods Genotypic resistance mutations were defined using the WHO-2009 surveillance list. Potential impact on antiretroviral drug was predicted according to the Stanford HIV db program version 7.0. The role of transmission clusters in drug resistant strains was evaluated by phylogenetic and network analyses. Results In this study, 589 individuals were recruited and 542 samples were amplified and sequenced successfully. The over prevalence of TDR was 6.1%: 1.8% to nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), 2.0% to non- NRTIs (NNRTIs) and 2.4% to protease inhibitors (PIs), respectively. We did not find significant differences in the TDR prevalence by demographic and clinical characteristics (p > 0.05). Using network and phylogenetic analysis, almost 60.0% sequences were clustered together. Of these clusters, 2 included at least two individuals carrying the same resistance mutation, accounting for 21.2% (7/33) individuals with TDR. No significant difference was observed in the clustering rate between the individuals with and without TDR. Conclusions We obtained a moderate level TDR rate in studied region. These findings enhance our understanding of HIV-1 drug resistance prevalence in Shijiazhuang, and may be helpful for the comprehensive prevention and control of HIV-1."
https://openalex.org/W2805419354,"Studies in rodents show that olfactory processing in the principal neurons of olfactory bulb (OB) and piriform cortex (PC) is controlled by local inhibitory interneurons, and glutamate NMDA receptor plays a role in this inhibitory control. It is not clear if findings from studies in rodents translate to olfactory processing in nonhuman primates (NHPs). In this study, the effect of the glutamate NMDA receptor antagonist MK801 on odorant-induced olfactory responses in the OB and PC of anesthetized NHPs (rhesus monkeys) was investigated by cerebral blood volume (CBV) fMRI. Isoamyl-acetate was used as the odor stimulant. For each NHP, sixty fMRI measurements were made during a 4-h period, with each 4-min measurement consisting of a 1-min baseline period, a 1-min odor stimulation period, and a 2-min recovery period. MK801 (0.3 mg/kg) was intravenously delivered 1 hour after starting fMRI. Before MK801 injection, olfactory fMRI activations were observed only in the OB, not in the PC. After MK801 injection, olfactory fMRI activations in the OB increased, and robust olfactory fMRI activations were observed in the PC. The data indicate that MK801 enhances the olfactory responses in both the OB and PC. The enhancement effects of MK801 are most likely from its blockage of NMDA receptors on local inhibitory interneurons and the attenuation of the inhibition onto principal neurons. This study suggests that the mechanism of local inhibitory control of principal neurons in the OB and PC derived from studies in rodents translates to NHPs."
https://openalex.org/W2805470845,"Background Colorectal cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths in Saudi Arabia. Cancer has a multifactorial nature and can be described as a disease of altered gene expression. The profiling of gene expression has been used to identify cancer subtypes and to predict patients’ responsiveness. Telomere-associated proteins that regulate telomere biology are essential molecules in cancer development. Thus, the present study examined their contributions to colorectal cancer progression in Saudi patients. Methods The expression of hTERT, TRF1, TRF2, POT1, ATR, ATM, Chk1 and Chk2 were measured via real-time PCR in matched cancerous and adjacent tissues of CRC patients. The protein level of hTERT, TRF1, TRF2, ATR, ATM, Chk1 and Chk2 were measured using immunohistochemistry. A region of hTERT core promoter was sequenced via Sanger sequencing. Methylation of CTCF binding site was examined via methylation-specific PCR. Finally, the length of telomere was estimated using q-PCR. Results Our results showed that POT1, ATR, Chk1 and Chk2 show increased expression in CRC relative to the adjacent mucosa. The expression levels of each gene were associated with clinicopathological characteristics of patients with CRC. There was a positive correlation between the age of the patients and hTERT expression. Regarding tumor site, telomere length, ATR, ATM and Chk1 were shown to be altered. No somatic mutation was detected in hTERT core promoter, and no differences in methylation patterns at CTCF binding site in the promoter between normal and cancer tissues. Conclusion Analysis of targeted genes expression in colorectal cancer based on the clinical variables revealed that tumor location and age could have a role in gene expression and telomere length variations and this could be taken under consideration during CRC diagnosis and therapy. Other epigenetic mechanisms could influence hTERT expression in cancers. Our findings warrant further validation through experiments involving a larger number of patients."
https://openalex.org/W2806153178,"Clinical studies have shown that cigarette smoking is a dose-dependent and independent risk factor for acute pancreatitis. Cigarette smoke contains nicotine which can be converted to the potent receptor ligand and toxin, NNK [4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone]. Previously, we have shown that NNK induces premature activation of pancreatic zymogens in rats, an initiating event in pancreatitis, and this activation is prevented by pharmacologic inhibition of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChR). In this study, we determined whether NNK mediates pancreatitis through the α7 isoform of nAChR using α7nAChR knockout mice. PCR analysis confirmed expression of non-neuronal α7nAChR in C57BL/6 (WT) mouse and human acinar cells. NNK treatment stimulated trypsinogen activation in acini from WT but not α7nAChR-/- mice. NNK also stimulated trypsinogen activation in human acini. To further confirm these findings, WT and α7nAChR-/- mice were treated with NNK in vivo and markers of pancreatitis were measured. As observed in acini NNK treatment induced trypsinogen activation in WT but not α7nAChR-/- mice. NNK also induced other markers of pancreatitis including pancreatic edema, vacuolization and pyknotic nuclei in WT but not α7nAChR-/- animals. NNK treatment led to increased neutrophil infiltration, a marker of inflammation, in WT mice and to a significantly lesser extent in α7nAChR-/- mice. We also examined downstream targets of α7nAChR activation and found that calcium and PKC activation are involved down stream of NNK stimulation of α7nAChR. In this study we used genetic deletion of the α7nAChR to confirm our previous inhibitor studies that demonstrated NNK stimulates pancreatitis by activating this receptor. Lastly, we demonstrate that NNK can also stimulate zymogen activation in human acinar cells and thus may play a role in human disease."
https://openalex.org/W2807266676,"Background Cancer causes significant morbidity and mortality among HIV patients in the US due to extended life expectancy with access to effective antiretroviral therapy. Low, detectable HIV RNA has been studied as a risk factor for adverse health outcomes, but its clinical impact on cancer risk remains unclear. The objective of this study was to determine whether HIV RNA <1,000 copies/mL six months after starting therapy was associated with 10-year first cancer risk. Methods We followed 7,515 HIV therapy initiators from a US-based multicenter clinical cohort from 1998 to 2014. We used nonparametric multiple imputation to account for viral loads that fell below assay detection limits, and categorized viral loads six months after therapy initiation into four groups: <20, 20–199, 200–999, and >999 copies/mL. We calculated estimates of the cumulative incidence of cancer diagnosis, accounting for death as a competing event. Inverse probability of exposure and censoring weights were used to control for confounding and differential loss to follow up, respectively. Results Crude 10-year first cancer risk in the study sample was 7.03% (95% CI: 6.08%, 7.98%), with the highest risk observed among patients with viral loads between 200 and 999 copies/mL six months after ART initiation (10.7%). After controlling for baseline confounders, 10-year first cancer risk was 6.90% (95% CI: 5.69%, 8.12%), and was similar across viral load categories. Conclusion Overall risk of first cancer was not associated with incomplete viral suppression; however, cancer remains a significant threat to HIV patients after treatment initiation. As more HIV patients gain access to treatment in the current “treat all” era, occurrences of incomplete viral suppression will be observed more frequently in clinical practice, which supports continued study of the role of low-level HIV RNA on cancer development."
https://openalex.org/W2805501054,"Mortality information of populations is aggregated in life tables that serve as a basis for calculation of life expectancy and various life disparity measures. Conventional life-table methods address right-censoring inadequately by assuming a constant hazard in the last open-ended age group. As a result, life expectancy can be substantially distorted, especially in the case when the last age group in a life table contains a large proportion of the population. Previous research suggests addressing censoring in a gamma-Gompertz-Makeham model setting as this framework incorporates all major features of adult mortality. In this article, we quantify the difference between gamma-Gompertz-Makeham life expectancy values and those published in the largest publicly available high-quality life-table databases for human populations, drawing attention to populations for which life expectancy values should be reconsidered. We also advocate the use of gamma-Gompertz-Makeham life expectancy for three reasons. First, model-based life-expectancy calculation successfully handles the problem of data quality or availability, resulting in severe censoring due to the unification of a substantial number of deaths in the last open-end age group. Second, model-based life expectancies are preferable in the case of data scarcity, i.e. when data contain numerous age groups with zero death counts: here, we provide an example of hunter-gatherer populations. Third, gamma-Gompertz-Makeham-based life expectancy values are almost identical to the ones provided by the major high-quality human mortality databases that use more complicated procedures. Applying a gamma-Gompertz-Makeham model to adult mortality data can be used to revise life-expectancy trends for historical populations that usually serve as input for mortality forecasts."

The time course of the pulmonary response to such an insult beyond the initial 48 hours is incompletely characterized. The purpose of this study was to comprehensively describe the pulmonary effects of focal lung acid injury over a seven day period in both directly injured and not directly injured lung tissue.Male Wistar rats underwent left-endobronchial instillation with hydrochloric acid and were sacrificed at 4, 24, 48, 96 or 168 h after the insult. Healthy non-injured animals served as controls. We assessed inflammatory cell counts and cytokine levels in right and left lung lavage fluid and blood, arterial oxygen tension, alterations in lung histology, lung wet-to-dry weight ratio and differential lung perfusion.Lung acid instillation induced an early strong inflammatory response in the directly affected lung, peaking at 4-24 hours, with only partial resolution after 7 days. A less severe response with complete resolution after 4 days was seen in the opposite lung. Alveolar cytokine levels, with exception of IL-6, only partially reflected the localization of lung injury and the time course of the functional and histologic alterations. Alveolar leucocyte subpopulations exhibited different time courses in the acid injured lung with persistent elevation of alveolar lymphocytes and macrophages. After acid instillation there was an early transient decrease in arterial oxygen tension and lung perfusion was preferentially distributed to the non-injured lung.These findings provide a basis for further research in the field of lung acid injury and for studies exploring effects of mechanical ventilation on injured lungs. Incomplete recovery in the directly injured lung 7 days after acid instillation suggests that increased vulnerability and susceptibility to further noxious stimuli are still present at that time."
https://openalex.org/W2807399847,"Trichinella spiralis mainly dwells in the muscle tissue of its host and is the main causative agent of trichinellosis in humans. Nitric oxide (NO), an important intracellular signaling molecule that may restrict pathogen growth in infected hosts, has been known for its anti-pathogenic activity, including resistance to T. spiralis. Herein, we applied label-free analysis to investigate the effect of sodium nitroprusside (SNP, a NO donor compound) on the proteome of T. spiralis muscle larvae (ML), followed by Gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway cluster analyses. Of the 1,476 proteins detected in the ML, 121 proteins showed differential expression, including 50 significantly upregulated and 71 downregulated proteins. The functions of the 108 annotated proteins were primarily related to signal transduction, transcription/translation, material metabolism, protein synthesis/assembly/degradation, and stress/defense/antioxidation. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) assay verified that FRMD5 and CUT-1 gene expression levels were significantly increased, while COX2 gene expression level was significantly decreased. GO annotation and KEGG pathway analyses showed that the majority of differentially expressed proteins were mainly involved in the molecular function of the catalytic activity, biological process of the immune system process, metabolic process, cellular component organization, biological adhesion, and cellular component of the macromolecular complex. Our results demonstrate the first comprehensive protein expression profile of the ML in response to NO stress and provide novel references for understanding the potential mechanism underlying the effects of NO on trichinellosis."
https://openalex.org/W2807034043,"To assess the effects of differential exposure to antenatal corticosteroid (ACS) on short- and long-term outcomes of infants born before 24 weeks of gestation.This is a retrospective cohort study of 147 infants delivered by 116 women at 21-23 weeks of gestation between January 2001 and December 2016 at a tertiary referral hospital in Seoul, Korea. Eligible subjects were categorized into the following three groups according to ACS exposure: non-user (n = 53), partial-course (n = 44), and complete-course (n = 50). Univariable and multivariable analyses were used to compare neonatal mortality, neonatal morbidities including intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH), and neurodevelopmental impairment including cerebral palsy among the three groups.Neonatal mortality rate was significantly lower in the ACS-user groups (non-user, 52.8%; partial-course, 27.3%; complete-course, 28.0%; P = 0.01), but complete-course of ACS therapy had no advantages over partial-course. A lower incidence of IVH was observed in the complete-course group (non-users, 54.8%; partial-course, 48.6%; complete-course, 20.5%; P = 0.003). Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that ACS therapy, either partial- or complete-course, was associated with a lower rate of neonatal mortality (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 0.375; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.141-0.996 in partial-course; aOR 0.173; 95% CI 0.052-0.574) in complete-course). IVH (aOR 0.191; 95% CI 0.071-0.516) was less likely to occur in the complete-course group than in the non-user group. Neurodevelopmental impairment of survivors at 18-22 month after birth was not significantly different among the three groups.ACS therapy in preterm births at 21-23 weeks of gestation was associated with significantly reduced rates of neonatal mortality and IVH, especially with complete administration."
https://openalex.org/W2807546181,"T cell recognition of peptides presented within self-major histocompatibility complex (pMHC) molecules is essential for long-lived protective immunity. As mice age the number of naive CD4+ and CD8+ T cells declines. However, unlike for CD8+ T cells, there are more naive and memory phenotype CD4+ T cells that bind foreign pMHCII in old mice (18-22 months) than adults (12-15 weeks), suggesting increased promiscuity of pMHCII recognition with aging. Here we asked if CD4+ T cell responses to immunization or infection increase with aging since the magnitude of a CD4+ T cell response to a foreign pMHCII is proportional to the size of the precursor population in adult mice. We observed no difference in the number of pMHCII-specific CD4+ T cells in adult versus old mice for pooled secondary lymphoid organs after immunization, bacterial infection, or viral infection, but we did observe diminished numbers of pMHCII-specific CD4+ T cells in both the draining lymph node and brain of old mice after West Nile virus infection. These data indicate that an increased precursor frequency does not translate into more robust responses upon immunization or infection in old mice."
