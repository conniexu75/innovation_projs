To push our understanding of functional brain organization to the level of individual humans, we assembled a novel MRI dataset containing 5 hr of RSFC data, 6 hr of task fMRI, multiple structural MRIs, and neuropsychological tests from each of ten adults. Using these data, we generated ten high-fidelity, individual-specific functional connectomes. This individual-connectome approach revealed several new types of spatial and organizational variability in brain networks, including unique network features and topologies that corresponded with structural and task-derived brain features. We are releasing this highly sampled, individual-focused dataset as a resource for neuroscientists, and we propose precision individual connectomics as a model for future work examining the organization of healthy and diseased individual human brains.

Over the past 30 years, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and, more recently, resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) fMRI studies based on the blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signal have significantly advanced our knowledge of human brain function and organization. By spatially coregistering and combining data from dozens, hundreds, or even thousands of individuals, neuroscientists have been able to reliably identify central tendencies of both task-induced activation patterns (Martin, 2007Martin A.

However, unlike structural MRI, which demonstrates clear clinical utility by describing the physical structure of individual brains, fMRI and RSFC research approaches have generally shied away from studying individuals, with the notable exception of studies focused on specific regions of the cortex using functional localizers (Kanwisher, 2017Kanwisher N. The Quest for the FFA and Where It Led.J. Neurosci. 2017; 37: 1056-1061Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) or high-field imaging (Cheng, 2016Cheng K.

Instead, much of systems neuroscience has focused on examining the group-average brain. While group averaging has revealed many basic principles of functional brain organization, the lack of emphasis on understanding individuals means that clinical applications of fMRI and RSFC have been limited to presurgical functional mapping (Mitchell et al., 2013Mitchell T.J. Hacker C.D. Breshears J.D. Szrama N.P. Sharma M. Bundy D.T. Pahwa M. Corbetta M. Snyder A.Z. Shimony J.S. Leuthardt E.C.

Presurgical planning for tumor resectioning.J. Magn. Reson. Imaging. 2006; 23: 887-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Because the temporal signal-to-noise ratio of BOLD MRI data is relatively low (Welvaert and Rosseel, 2013Welvaert M. Rosseel Y. On the definition of signal-to-noise ratio and contrast-to-noise ratio for FMRI data.PLoS ONE. 2013; 8: e77089Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar), results obtained in individuals using small quantities of per-subject fMRI data (5–20 min) cannot precisely characterize brain function and organization (Anderson et al., 2011Anderson J.S.

This approach identifies group-level central tendencies that generalize across individuals, but it obscures subject-specific features. Similarly, studies describing cross-individual variability in functional brain organization have tended to use large datasets with relatively small amounts of per-individual data (Gordon et al., 2017aGordon E.M.

Cortex. 2016; 26: 4192-4211Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Thus, detailed characterization of individual brains has so far been limited (Laumann et al., 2015Laumann T.O. Gordon E.M. Adeyemo B. Snyder A.Z. Joo S.J. Chen M.-Y. Gilmore A.W. McDermott K.B. Nelson S.M.

Commun. 2015; 6: 8885Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). We contend that it is now appropriate to expand the standard human functional neuroimaging approach by developing methods to systematically characterize brain function and organization in single individuals. Individual-specific neuroimaging will be critical for determining whether differences in brain organization are behavior-related, disease-dependent, or epiphenomenal. This approach will also empower the study of individuals with idiosyncratic brain lesions (Fair et al., 2006Fair D.A. Brown T.T. Petersen S.E.

Finally, precise descriptions of brain organization in individual neurological, neurosurgical, and psychiatric patients may enable custom treatment approaches beyond basic presurgical functional mapping (Hacker et al., 2013Hacker C.D. Laumann T.O. Szrama N.P. Baldassarre A. Snyder A.Z. Leuthardt E.C. Corbetta M. Resting state network estimation in individual subjects.Neuroimage. 2013; 82: 616-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Recently, Laumann et al., 2015Laumann T.O. Gordon E.M. Adeyemo B. Snyder A.Z. Joo S.J. Chen M.-Y. Gilmore A.W. McDermott K.B. Nelson S.M. Dosenbach N.U.F. et al.Functional System and areal organization of a highly sampled individual human brain.Neuron. 2015; 87: 657-670Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar characterized an individual’s functional brain organization by analyzing many hours of RSFC data collected from a single person across more than a year (Poldrack et al., 2015Poldrack R.A. Laumann T.O. Koyejo O. Gregory B. Hover A. Chen M.-Y. Gorgolewski K.J. Luci J. Joo S.J. Boyd R.L. et al.Long-term neural and physiological phenotyping of a single human.Nat. Commun. 2015; 6: 8885Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). This work suggested that 1) with sufficient data, reliable estimates of brain networks can be produced in a single individual; 2) features of an individual’s network map closely correspond with task-driven fMRI activations; and, most notably, 3) individual brain networks are more detailed than group-average networks, as small features are often obscured by averaging across groups. Together, these findings provided a single example of how individual specificity can be achieved using extensive within-individual data collection. The present work represents a critical next step toward establishing precision individual connectomics as a research paradigm. To advance this nascent area of neuroscience, we collected a large quantity of data from ten individuals (24–34 years; 5F), each of whom underwent many hours of RSFC, task-based fMRI, structural MRI, and a neuropsychological testing battery (Figure 1, Table 1). To standardize time-of-day effects (Shannon et al., 2013Shannon B.J. Dosenbach R.A. Su Y. Vlassenko A.G. Larson-Prior L.J. Nolan T.S. Snyder A.Z. Raichle M.E.

This characterization includes 1) assessment of within-subject quality of RSFC data, including the reliability of multiple connectional and graph-theoretical measures of network function; 2) precise description of the brain network organization of each individual MSC subject, including both the physical topography and network topology; and 3) convergence between individuals’ task activation patterns, RSFC-derived brain networks, and distributions of cortical myelin. Figure 1 shows a graphical summary of the MSC dataset. In each of the ten subjects, we collected 3.5 hr of structural MRI data; 5 hr of RSFC data; 6 hr of task-based fMRI data across three different tasks, including a blocked motor task, a mixed blocked and event-related perceptual and language task, and an event-related incidental memory task with multiple stimulus types; and a neuropsychological testing battery (Table 1). Averaged activity time courses were extracted from individual-specific parcels (defined following Laumann et al., 2015Laumann T.O. Gordon E.M. Adeyemo B. Snyder A.Z. Joo S.J. Chen M.-Y. Gilmore A.W. McDermott K.B. Nelson S.M. Dosenbach N.U.F. et al.Functional System and areal organization of a highly sampled individual human brain.Neuron. 2015; 87: 657-670Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar) and concatenated across sessions. Iterative split-data reliability analyses (as in Laumann et al., 2015Laumann T.O. Gordon E.M. Adeyemo B. Snyder A.Z. Joo S.J. Chen M.-Y. Gilmore A.W. McDermott K.B. Nelson S.M. Dosenbach N.U.F. et al.Functional System and areal organization of a highly sampled individual human brain.Neuron. 2015; 87: 657-670Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar) for multiple FC measures were conducted in each individual. Reliability was assessed for 1) the parcel-to-parcel connectivity matrix and 2) the network membership assigned to each parcel. Previous work has evaluated brain networks using three fundamental graph-theoretic concepts: the brain’s hub structure, efficiency of information transfer, and modular organization (Bassett and Bullmore, 2009Bassett D.S. Bullmore E.T. Human brain networks in health and disease.Curr. Opin. Neurol. 2009; 22: 340-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar, Bullmore and Sporns, 2009Bullmore E. Sporns O. Complex brain networks: graph theoretical analysis of structural and functional systems.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2009; 10: 186-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (7299) Google Scholar). Therefore, we also examined the reliability of three measures commonly employed to evaluate these properties: 3) the participation coefficient (PC), a measure of the diversity of a region’s cross-network connectivity contributing to its hub status (Guimerà et al., 2007Guimerà R. Sales-Pardo M. Amaral L.A.N. Classes of complex networks defined by role-to-role connectivity profiles.Nat. Phys. 2007; 3: 63-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar, Power et al., 2013Power J.D. Schlaggar B.L. Lessov-Schlaggar C.N. Petersen S.E. Evidence for hubs in human functional brain networks.Neuron. 2013; 79: 798-813Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar); 4) global efficiency, a whole-brain measure of network information transfer (Rubinov and Sporns, 2010Rubinov M. Sporns O. Complex network measures of brain connectivity: uses and interpretations.Neuroimage. 2010; 52: 1059-1069Crossref PubMed Scopus (6873) Google Scholar); and 5) modularity, a measure of how well the whole-brain graph can be represented as a set of discrete networks (Newman, 2004Newman M.E.J. Fast algorithm for detecting community structure in networks.Phys. Rev. E Stat. Nonlin. Soft Matter Phys. 2004; 69: 066133Crossref Scopus (697) Google Scholar). Figures 2A–2E illustrate that all measures exhibited relatively poor reliability given “typical” quantities of data (<10 min retained after motion censoring). Reliability of many measures sharply increased with inclusion of additional data. In one individual (MSC08), parcel-to-parcel connectivity similarity was low (Figures 2A and 2H), most likely owing to residual motion effects (Figure S2). However, MSC08’s data was much less reliable than the overall relationship between residual motion effects and reliability would predict. This subject repeatedly reported falling asleep and exhibited frequent, prolonged eye closures and systematic increases in head motion over the course of each run (See Figure S1). Thus, low reliability likely is attributable to high levels of drowsiness (Laumann et al., 2016Laumann T.O. Snyder A.Z. Mitra A. Gordon E.M. Gratton C. Adeyemo B. Gilmore A.W. Nelson S.M. Berg J.J. Greene D.J. et al.On the stability of BOLD fMRI correlations.Cereb. Cortex. 2016; : 1-14PubMed Google Scholar, Tagliazucchi and Laufs, 2014Tagliazucchi E. Laufs H. Decoding wakefulness levels from typical fMRI resting-state data reveals reliable drifts between wakefulness and sleep.Neuron. 2014; 82: 695-708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). The quantity of data required for reliable estimation depended on the measure of interest. Excluding subject MSC08, we observed that 30 min of motion-censored data was required to achieve an average (across subjects) correlation matrix reliability of r > 0.85 (Figure 2A). Network assignment required even more data (90 min) to achieve an average Dice coefficient > 0.75 (Figure 2B). Modularity achieved an average difference of < 3% from the split-data sample (Figure 2E) with only 10 min of data, while global efficiency required 90 min to achieve the same reliability (Figure 2D). The PC measure never achieved a high degree of split-data similarity in most subjects (maximum r = 0.5–0.65; Figure 2C). Reliabilities calculated at each graph density are shown in Figures S2A–S2C. Regarding global efficiency and modularity, increasing the amount of data not only increased reliability but also altered expectation values, suggesting that these metrics systematically depend on data quantity. This effect is illustrated in Figures 2F and 2G. Across all subjects, global efficiency calculated from less than 20 min of motion-censored data was systematically elevated (Figure 2F) while modularity calculated from less than 20 min of data was systematically depressed (Figure 2G). Session-level RSFC matrix similarity was examined both within and across subjects using an a priori group-level parcellation (Gordon et al., 2016Gordon E.M. Laumann T.O. Adeyemo B. Huckins J.F. Kelley W.M. Petersen S.E. Generation and Evaluation of a cortical area parcellation from resting-state correlations.Cereb. Cortex. 2016; 26: 288-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar). Within-subject similarity was high across sessions (diagonal blocks in Figure 2H; worst in MSC08), with intersession variability most prominent in primary somatosensory and motor cortex (see Figures S2E and S2F). For each session, correlation matrix similarity was greater within subject than across subjects (all t > 3.34; all p ≤ 0.001), meaning that individual RSFC patterns were distinct. In the following sections, we report detailed topographical and topological characterization of these individually distinct networks. To compare network topographies across individuals, we used a graph-theory-based community detection approach (Power et al., 2011Power J.D. Cohen A.L. Nelson S.M. Wig G.S. Barnes K.A. Church J.A.

Functional network organization of the human brain.Neuron. 2011; 72: 665-678Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2508) Google Scholar). Networks were defined in each individual by collapsing across density thresholds (Laumann et al., 2015Laumann T.O. Gordon E.M. Adeyemo B. Snyder A.Z. Joo S.J. Chen M.-Y. Gilmore A.W. McDermott K.B.

Identified networks included the default mode (DMN); medial and lateral visual (mVis, lVis); cingulo-opercular (CON); salience; fronto-parietal (FPN); dorsal attention (DAN); ventral attention (VAN); hand, face, and leg somatomotor (hSMN, fSMN, lSMN); auditory; premotor; parietal memory (PMN); contextual association (CAN); and anterior and posterior medial temporal networks (aMTL, pMTL). Network topographies were consistent across density thresholds (Figures S3B and S3C). With the exception of a small region in parieto-occipital sulcus, cross-subject variability in RSFC patterns was not related to cortical folding (Figure S3D). We observed broad consistencies in network topographies across the ten individual datasets (Figures 3A and 3B ). For example, all network maps showed hallmark DMN features in medial parietal cortex, medial prefrontal cortex, and bilateral angular gyri that are consistently seen in group-average data (Raichle and Snyder, 2007Raichle M.E. Snyder A.Z. A default mode of brain function: a brief history of an evolving idea.Neuroimage. 2007; 37 (discussion 1097–1099): 1083-1090Crossref PubMed Scopus (1653) Google Scholar). Similarly, all subjects showed canonical FPN features in lateral prefrontal cortex, lateral parietal cortex, dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, and lateral temporal cortex. However, certain network features were observed that were absent from the group average. For example, five of ten MSC subjects had a region of CON in anterior inferior/middle frontal gyrus (Figure 3A, purple arrows); six subjects had an lVis feature in lateral parietal cortex (Figure 3A, dark blue arrows); seven subjects had a salience feature in ventromedial prefrontal cortex (Figure 3B, black arrows); and five subjects had an FPN feature in middle cingulate cortex (Figure 3B, yellow arrows). None of these features were present in the group-average network map. As an example, we highlight the connectivity of the salience network feature in ventromedial prefrontal cortex in one subject. Although this region has long been considered a core node of the DMN (Raichle et al., 2001Raichle M.E. MacLeod A.M. Snyder A.Z. Powers W.J. Gusnard D.A. Shulman G.L. A default mode of brain function.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2001; 98: 676-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (9041) Google Scholar), here we show that in subject MSC06, a region in the medial prefrontal cortex (Figure 3C: seed B, black arrow) was strongly correlated with pregenual cingulate, frontal pole, ventral insula, and temporal-parietal junction, but was un- or anti-correlated with canonical DMN regions (white circles). An adjacent seed in a portion of the vmPFC identified as DMN network (Figure 3C, seed A, red arrow) showed the expected strong medial parietal and angular gyrus connectivity. By contrast, the same two seeds showed almost no connectivity differences in the MSC group average (Figure 3C). Characterizing brain networks requires understanding the brain’s global network structure, especially the relationships within and between networks. To pursue this analysis in a well-defined, individual-specific network space (Wig et al., 2011Wig G.S. Schlaggar B.L. Petersen S.E. Concepts and principles in the analysis of brain networks.Ann. N Y Acad. Sci. 2011; 1224: 126-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar), we identified parcel-level brain networks using the individual-specific cortical parcellations employed in the RSFC reliability analyses (above). The topographies of individual-specific brain networks were nearly identical vertex-wise (Figure 3A) and parcel-wise (Figure S4), suggesting that the network topographies are consistent across these two spatial scales. Network structures for each subject and for the group average were visualized using spring-embedded plots (Dosenbach et al., 2008Dosenbach N.U.F. Fair D.A. Cohen A.L. Schlaggar B.L. Petersen S.E.

Senescent cells secrete a variety of inflammatory factors, collectively referred to as the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). The mechanism(s) underlying the regulation of the SASP remains incompletely understood. Here we define a role for innate DNA sensing in the regulation of senescence and the SASP. We find that cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) recognizes cytosolic chromatin fragments in senescent cells. The activation of cGAS, in turn, triggers the production of SASP factors via stimulator of interferon genes (STING), thereby promoting paracrine senescence. We demonstrate that diverse stimuli of cellular senescence engage the cGAS-STING pathway in vitro and we show cGAS-dependent regulation of senescence following irradiation and oncogene activation in vivo. Our findings provide insights into the mechanisms underlying cellular senescence by establishing the cGAS-STING pathway as a crucial regulator of senescence and the SASP."
https://openalex.org/W2741286864,"Organoid techniques provide unique platforms to model brain development and neurological disorders. Whereas several methods for recapitulating corticogenesis have been described, a system modeling human medial ganglionic eminence (MGE) development, a critical ventral brain domain producing cortical interneurons and related lineages, has been lacking until recently. Here, we describe the generation of MGE and cortex-specific organoids from human pluripotent stem cells that recapitulate the development of MGE and cortex domains, respectively. Population and single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) profiling combined with bulk assay for transposase-accessible chromatin with high-throughput sequencing (ATAC-seq) analyses revealed transcriptional and chromatin accessibility dynamics and lineage relationships during MGE and cortical organoid development. Furthermore, MGE and cortical organoids generated physiologically functional neurons and neuronal networks. Finally, fusing region-specific organoids followed by live imaging enabled analysis of human interneuron migration and integration. Together, our study provides a platform for generating domain-specific brain organoids and modeling human interneuron migration and offers deeper insight into molecular dynamics during human brain development."
https://openalex.org/W2741037975,"Cas13a, a type VI-A CRISPR-Cas RNA-guided RNA ribonuclease, degrades invasive RNAs targeted by CRISPR RNA (crRNA) and has potential applications in RNA technology. To understand how Cas13a is activated to cleave RNA, we have determined the crystal structure of Leptotrichia buccalis (Lbu) Cas13a bound to crRNA and its target RNA, as well as the cryo-EM structure of the LbuCas13a-crRNA complex. The crRNA-target RNA duplex binds in a positively charged central channel of the nuclease (NUC) lobe, and Cas13a protein and crRNA undergo a significant conformational change upon target RNA binding. The guide-target RNA duplex formation triggers HEPN1 domain to move toward HEPN2 domain, activating the HEPN catalytic site of Cas13a protein, which subsequently cleaves both single-stranded target and collateral RNAs in a non-specific manner. These findings reveal how Cas13a of type VI CRISPR-Cas systems defend against RNA phages and set the stage for its development as a tool for RNA manipulation."
https://openalex.org/W2742000848,"Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) is one of the most lethal human malignancies, owing in part to its propensity for metastasis. Here, we used an organoid culture system to investigate how transcription and the enhancer landscape become altered during discrete stages of disease progression in a PDA mouse model. This approach revealed that the metastatic transition is accompanied by massive and recurrent alterations in enhancer activity. We implicate the pioneer factor FOXA1 as a driver of enhancer activation in this system, a mechanism that renders PDA cells more invasive and less anchorage-dependent for growth in vitro, as well as more metastatic in vivo. In this context, FOXA1-dependent enhancer reprogramming activates a transcriptional program of embryonic foregut endoderm. Collectively, our study implicates enhancer reprogramming, FOXA1 upregulation, and a retrograde developmental transition in PDA metastasis."
https://openalex.org/W2740651538,"Insistence on sameness and intolerance of change are among the diagnostic criteria for autism spectrum disorder (ASD), but little research has addressed how people with ASD represent and respond to environmental change. Here, behavioral and pupillometric measurements indicated that adults with ASD are less surprised than neurotypical adults when their expectations are violated, and decreased surprise is predictive of greater symptom severity. A hierarchical Bayesian model of learning suggested that in ASD, a tendency to overlearn about volatility in the face of environmental change drives a corresponding reduction in learning about probabilistically aberrant events, thus putatively rendering these events less surprising. Participant-specific modeled estimates of surprise about environmental conditions were linked to pupil size in the ASD group, thus suggesting heightened noradrenergic responsivity in line with compromised neural gain. This study offers insights into the behavioral, algorithmic and physiological mechanisms underlying responses to environmental volatility in ASD."

Its neural mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here we adapt recent advances from human research for rats, presenting for the first time an animal task that produces many trials of planned behavior per session, making multitrial rodent experimental tools available to study planning. We use part of this toolkit to address a perennially controversial issue in planning: the role of the dorsal hippocampus. Although prospective hippocampal representations have been proposed to support planning, intact planning in animals with damaged hippocampi has been repeatedly observed. Combining formal algorithmic behavioral analysis with muscimol inactivation, we provide causal evidence directly linking dorsal hippocampus with planning behavior. Our results and methods open the door to new and more detailed investigations of the neural mechanisms of planning in the hippocampus and throughout the brain."
https://openalex.org/W2741206081,"Glioblastomas represent the most aggressive glioma grade and are associated with a poor patient prognosis. The current standard of care, consisting of surgery, radiation and chemotherapy, only results in a median survival of 14 months, underscoring the importance of developing effective new therapeutic strategies. Among the challenges in treating glioblastomas are primary resistance and the rapid emergence of recurrent disease, which can result from tumor cell-intrinsic mechanisms in addition to tumor microenvironment (TME)-mediated extrinsic resistance. Using a PDGF-B-driven proneural glioma mouse model, we assessed a panel of tyrosine kinase inhibitors with different selectivity profiles. We found that PLX3397, an inhibitor of colony stimulating factor-1 receptor (CSF-1R), blocks glioma progression, markedly suppresses tumor cell proliferation and reduces tumor grade. By contrast, the multi-targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitors dovitinib and vatalanib, which directly target tumor cells, exert minimal anti-tumoral effects in vivo, despite killing glioma cells in vitro, suggesting a TME-mediated resistance mechanism may be involved. Interestingly, PLX3397 interferes with tumor-mediated education of macrophages and consequently restores the sensitivity of glioma cells to tyrosine kinase inhibitors in vivo in preclinical combination trials. Our findings thus demonstrate that microenvironmental alteration by CSF-1R blockade renders tumor cells more susceptible to receptor tyrosine kinase inhibition in a preclinical glioblastoma model, which may have important translational relevance."
https://openalex.org/W2741524908,"Obesity is associated with an increase in cancer-specific mortality in women with breast cancer. Elevated cholesterol, particularly low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), is frequently seen in obese women. Here, we aimed to determine the importance of elevated circulating LDL, and LDL receptor (LDLR) expression in tumor cells, on the growth of breast cancer using mouse models of hyperlipidemia. We describe two novel immunodeficient mouse models of hyperlipidemia (Rag1−/−/LDLR−/− and Rag1−/−/ApoE (apolipoprotein E)−/− mice) in addition to established immunocompetent LDLR−/− and ApoE−/− mice. The mice were used to study the effects of elevated LDL-C in human triple-negative (MDA-MB-231) and mouse Her2/Neu-overexpressing (MCNeuA) breast cancers. Tumors derived from MCNeuA and MDA-MB-231 cells had high LDLR expression and formed larger tumors in mice with high circulating LDL-C concentrations than in mice with lower LDL-C. Silencing the LDLR in the tumor cells led to decreased growth of Her2/Neu-overexpressing tumors in LDLR−/− and ApoE−/− mice, with increased Caspase 3 cleavage. Additionally, in vitro, silencing the LDLR led to decreased cell survival in serum-starved conditions, associated with Caspase 3 cleavage. Examining publically available human data sets, we found that high LDLR expression in human breast cancers was associated with decreased recurrence-free survival, particularly in patients treated with systemic therapies. Overall, our results highlight the importance of the LDLR in the growth of triple-negative and HER2-overexpressing breast cancers in the setting of elevated circulating LDL-C, which may be important contributing factors to the increased recurrence and mortality in obese women with breast cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2741363039,"How environmental and physiological signals interact to influence neural circuits underlying developmentally programmed social interactions such as male territorial aggression is poorly understood. We have tested the influence of sensory cues, social context, and sex hormones on progesterone receptor (PR)-expressing neurons in the ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH) that are critical for male territorial aggression. We find that these neurons can drive aggressive displays in solitary males independent of pheromonal input, gonadal hormones, opponents, or social context. By contrast, these neurons cannot elicit aggression in socially housed males that intrude in another male’s territory unless their pheromone-sensing is disabled. This modulation of aggression cannot be accounted for by linear integration of environmental and physiological signals. Together, our studies suggest that fundamentally non-linear computations enable social context to exert a dominant influence on developmentally hard-wired hypothalamus-mediated male territorial aggression."

The HIV-1 virus encodes a single surface protein, gp160. The spike is a trimer of furin-cleaved gp160s, each of which is composed of two non-covalently associated subunits, gp41 and gp120. The cellular receptor CD4 binds to gp120, leading to dissociation of the trimer and exposing epitopes commonly targeted by non-neutralizing antibodies (nnAbs) against HIV-1 Env. Nearly all HIV-1-infected individuals develop nnAbs early in the course of infection. The initial response is typically directed against gp41 and later evolves to include gp120 (Tomaras et al., 2008Tomaras G.D. Yates N.L. Liu P. Qin L. Fouda G.G. Chavez L.L. Decamp A.C. Parks R.J.

After a variable period, usually measured in years, a fraction of infected individuals goes on to develop potent broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs), which have been shown to target a number of epitopes on the trimer (Klein et al., 2013bKlein F.

The unusual delay between infection and bNAb development, and the difficulty in eliciting them by immunization, is explained in large part by their extraordinary levels of somatic mutations (Andris et al., 1991Andris J.S.

Here, we report on experiments that explore whether nnAbs can influence the course of HIV-1 infection in vivo, and we define the mechanisms by which they do so. To examine the effects of nnAbs on HIV-1 infection, we engineered a recombinant HIV-1 reporter virus (HIVivoHA) expressing a heterologous surface marker, mCD24/heat-stable antigen (HSA) bearing a hemagglutinin tag (HA-tag), and adapted it to replicate in humanized mice (hu-mice) (Figures 1A and S1). The HA-tag is anchored to the membrane of HIVivoHA virions and infected cells by the transmembrane domain of HSA and it is entirely independent of HIV-1 Env. Accordingly, a humanized IgG1 anti-HA-tag antibody (anti-HA) (Churchill et al., 1994Churchill M.E. Stura E.A. Pinilla C. Appel J.R. Houghten R.A. Kono D.H. Balderas R.S. Fieser G.G. Schulze-Gahmen U.

(H) HIVivoHA infection is sustained at high viral loads for at least 39 days. To determine whether anti-HA enhances clearance of HIVivoHA-infected cells in vivo, we performed adoptive transfer experiments (Lu et al., 2016Lu C.L. Murakowski D.K. Bournazos S. Schoofs T. Sarkar D. Halper-Stromberg A. Horwitz J.A. Nogueira L. Golijanin J. Gazumyan A. et al.Enhanced clearance of HIV-1-infected cells by broadly neutralizing antibodies against HIV-1 in vivo.Science. 2016; 352: 1001-1004Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar) of cells infected with the indicator virus in the presence or absence of anti-HA antibody. Anti-HA antibody directed near-complete clearance of HIVivoHA-infected cells from the mice within 5 hr (Figure 1C), as would be expected for antibody-driven, Fc-dependent clearance of cells bearing a highly expressed surface antigen (Smith et al., 2012Smith P. DiLillo D.J. Bournazos S. Li F. Ravetch J.V. Mouse model recapitulating human Fcγ receptor structural and functional diversity.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2012; 109: 6181-6186Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). By contrast, a modified anti-HA that carries mutations that abrogate binding to activating Fc receptors (anti-HA:GRLR) (Pietzsch et al., 2012Pietzsch J. Gruell H. Bournazos S. Donovan B.M. Klein F. Diskin R. Seaman M.S. Bjorkman P.J. Ravetch J.V. Ploss A. Nussenzweig M.C. A mouse model for HIV-1 entry.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2012; 109: 15859-15864Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) failed to clear HIVivoHA-infected cells, and the percentage of HA+Gag+ cells was comparable to the percentage seen in untreated mice. Thus, anti-HA, which is a nnAb, can clear HIV-1-infected cells in vivo in an Fc receptor-dependent manner (Figure 1C). To determine whether a nnAb can affect the course of viral infection in vivo, we established HIVivoHA infection in hu-mice and then treated with anti-HA or anti-HA:GRLR. Effects on viral load after anti-HA administration were modest (Figure 1D). However, flow cytometry showed that infected cells from anti-HA-treated animals were devoid of surface HA expression, while anti-HA:GRLR-treated animals retained HA (Figure 1E). Single-genome sequencing of plasma viruses revealed that loss of HA expression in anti-HA-treated mice was due to mutation or deletion of the HSA-HA cassette. In contrast, the HA cassette remained intact in most viruses isolated from anti-HA:GRLR-treated animals, indicating an Fc-dependent mechanism of selection (Figure 1F). Thus, anti-HA imposes selective pressure on HIV-1 by an Fc-dependent mechanism that leads to predominance of anti-HA-resistant viruses. To determine whether nnAbs can also prevent HIV-1 infection in hu-mice, we administered anti-HA or anti-HA:GRLR to hu-mice 1 day before and 1 day after challenge with HIVivoHA. Whereas all mice receiving no treatment or anti-HA:GRLR became viremic, a majority (55%) of animals treated with anti-HA were protected from HIVivoHA infection (Figure 2). The 45% of anti-HA-treated mice that did become viremic did so with delayed onset, after the serum antibody concentrations had waned, and the emerging viruses had lost the HA expression cassette (Figures 2A and 2B). Thus, anti-HA protected against HIVivoHA infection and blocked the outgrowth of HA-expressing viruses in hu-mice. We conclude that nnAbs can prevent infection when they target a highly expressed surface epitope, albeit to a lesser extent than bNAbs (Balazs et al., 2011Balazs A.B. Chen J. Hong C.M. Rao D.S.

https://openalex.org/W2738950689,"Yates and colleagues statistically dissect MT and LIP responses during motion discrimination. They show decreasing temporal weighting of motion in MT, consistent with psychophysical weighting, and show that LIP spikes encode the upcoming choice more than integrated motion or simultaneously recorded MT spikes, suggesting an indirect relationship between these areas. During perceptual decision-making, responses in the middle temporal (MT) and lateral intraparietal (LIP) areas appear to map onto theoretically defined quantities, with MT representing instantaneous motion evidence and LIP reflecting the accumulated evidence. However, several aspects of the transformation between the two areas have not been empirically tested. We therefore performed multistage systems identification analyses of the simultaneous activity of MT and LIP during individual decisions. We found that monkeys based their choices on evidence presented in early epochs of the motion stimulus and that substantial early weighting of motion was present in MT responses. LIP responses recapitulated MT early weighting and contained a choice-dependent buildup that was distinguishable from motion integration. Furthermore, trial-by-trial variability in LIP did not depend on MT activity. These results identify important deviations from idealizations of MT and LIP and motivate inquiry into sensorimotor computations that may intervene between MT and LIP."
https://openalex.org/W2737678248,"Copper plays a dual role as a nutrient and a toxin during bacterial infections. While uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC) strains can use the copper-binding metallophore yersiniabactin (Ybt) to resist copper toxicity, Ybt also converts bioavailable copper to Cu(II)-Ybt in low-copper conditions. Although E. coli have long been considered to lack a copper import pathway, we observed Ybt-mediated copper import in UPEC using canonical Fe(III)-Ybt transport proteins. UPEC removed copper from Cu(II)-Ybt with subsequent re-export of metal-free Ybt to the extracellular space. Copper released through this process became available to an E. coli cuproenzyme (the amine oxidase TynA), linking this import pathway to a nutrient acquisition function. Ybt-expressing E. coli thus engage in nutritional passivation, a strategy of minimizing a metal ion's toxicity while preserving its nutritional availability. Copper acquisition through this process may contribute to the marked virulence defect of Ybt-transport-deficient UPEC."

This study aims to comprehensively explore the expression pattern and functional role of TEAD family in gastric carcinogenesis and investigate its regulation by microRNAs (miRNAs). The mRNA and protein expression of TEAD family were examined by quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR) and western blot. Their functional roles were determined by in vitro and in vivo studies. The clinicopathological association of TEAD4 in gastric cancer (GC) was studied using immunohistochemistry on tissue microarray. The prediction of miRNAs, which potentially target TEAD1/4, was performed by TargetScan and miRDB. The regulation of TEAD1/4 by miRNAs was confirmed by qRT-PCR, western blot and luciferase assays. TEAD1/4 were overexpressed in GC cell lines and primary GC tissues. Knockdown of TEAD1/4 induced a significant anticancer effect in vitro and in vivo. TEAD1 was confirmed to be a direct target of miR-377-3p and miR-4269, while TEAD4 was negatively regulated by miR-1343-3p and miR-4269. Among them, miR-4269 was the most effective inhibitor of TEAD1/4. Ectopic expression of these miRNAs substantiated their tumor-suppressive effects. In primary GC tumors, downregulation of miR-4269 was associated with poor disease-specific survival and showed a negative correlation with TEAD4. TEAD1 and TEAD4 are oncogenic factors, whose aberrant activation are, in part, mediated by the silence of miR-377-3p, miR-1343-3p and miR-4269. For the first time, the nuclear accumulated TEAD4 and downregulated miR-4269 are proposed to serve as novel prognostic biomarkers in GC."
https://openalex.org/W2741910696,"Gut microbiota can regulate the host energy metabolism; however, the underlying mechanisms that could involve gut microbiota-derived compounds remain to be understood. Therefore, in this study, we investigated the effects of KetoA [10-oxo-12(Z)-octadecenoic acid]-a linoleic acid metabolite produced by gut lactic acid bacteria-on whole-body energy metabolism and found that dietary intake of KetoA could enhance energy expenditure in mice, thereby protecting mice from diet-induced obesity. By using Ca2+ imaging and whole-cell patch-clamp methods, KetoA was noted to potently activate transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) and enhance noradrenalin turnover in adipose tissues. In addition, KetoA up-regulated genes that are related to brown adipocyte functions, including uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) in white adipose tissue (WAT), which was later diminished in the presence of a β-adrenoreceptor blocker. By using obese and diabetic model KK-Ay mice, we further show that KetoA intake ameliorated obesity-associated metabolic disorders. In the absence of any observed KetoA-induced antiobesity effect or UCP1 up-regulation in TRPV1-deficient mice, we prove that the antiobesity effect of KetoA was caused by TRPV1 activation-mediated browning in WAT. KetoA produced in the gut could therefore be involved in the regulation of host energy metabolism.-Kim, M., Furuzono, T., Yamakuni, K., Li, Y., Kim, Y.-I., Takahashi, H., Ohue-Kitano, R., Jheng, H.-F., Takahashi, N., Kano, Y., Yu, R., Kishino, S., Ogawa, J., Uchida, K., Yamazaki, J., Tominaga, M., Kawada, T., Goto, T. 10-oxo-12(Z)-octadecenoic acid, a linoleic acid metabolite produced by gut lactic acid bacteria, enhances energy metabolism by activation of TRPV1."
https://openalex.org/W2740599947,"The majority of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) is still poorly characterized with respect to function, interactions with protein-coding genes, and mechanisms that regulate their expression. As for protein-coding RNAs, epigenetic deregulation of lncRNA expression by alterations in DNA methylation might contribute to carcinogenesis. To provide genome-wide information on lncRNAs aberrantly methylated in breast cancer we profiled tumors of the C3(1) SV40TAg mouse model by MCIp-seq (Methylated CpG Immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing). This approach detected 69 lncRNAs differentially methylated between tumor tissue and normal mammary glands, with 26 located in antisense orientation of a protein-coding gene. One of the hypomethylated lncRNAs, 1810019D21Rik (now called Esrp2-antisense (as)) was identified in proximity to the epithelial splicing regulatory protein 2 (Esrp2) that is significantly elevated in C3(1) tumors. ESRPs were shown previously to have a dual role in carcinogenesis. Both gain and loss have been associated with poor prognosis in human cancers, but the mechanisms regulating expression are not known. In-depth analyses indicate that coordinate overexpression of Esrp2 and Esrp2-as inversely correlates with DNA methylation. Luciferase reporter gene assays support co-expression of Esrp2 and the major short Esrp2-as variant from a bidirectional promoter, and transcriptional regulation by methylation of a proximal enhancer. Ultimately, this enhancer-based regulatory mechanism provides a novel explanation for tissue-specific expression differences and upregulation of Esrp2 during carcinogenesis. Knockdown of Esrp2-as reduced Esrp2 protein levels without affecting mRNA expression and resulted in an altered transcriptional profile associated with extracellular matrix (ECM), cell motility and reduced proliferation, whereas overexpression enhanced proliferation. Our findings not only hold true for the murine tumor model, but led to the identification of an unannotated human homolog of Esrp2-as which is significantly upregulated in human breast cancer and associated with poor prognosis."

Genetic discovery from the multitude of phenotypes extractable from routine healthcare data can transform understanding of the human phenome and accelerate progress toward precision medicine. However, a critical question when analyzing high-dimensional and heterogeneous data is how best to interrogate increasingly specific subphenotypes while retaining statistical power to detect genetic associations. Here we develop and employ a new Bayesian analysis framework that exploits the hierarchical structure of diagnosis classifications to analyze genetic variants against UK Biobank disease phenotypes derived from self-reporting and hospital episode statistics. Our method displays a more than 20% increase in power to detect genetic effects over other approaches and identifies new associations between classical human leukocyte antigen (HLA) alleles and common immune-mediated diseases (IMDs). By applying the approach to genetic risk scores (GRSs), we show the extent of genetic sharing among IMDs and expose differences in disease perception or diagnosis with potential clinical implications."
https://openalex.org/W2741550721,"Hsp70 molecular chaperones play key roles in cellular protein homeostasis by binding to exposed hydrophobic regions of incompletely folded or aggregated proteins. This crucial Hsp70 function relies on allosteric communication between two well-structured domains: an N-terminal nucleotide-binding domain (NBD) and a C-terminal substrate-binding domain (SBD), which are tethered by an interdomain linker. ATP or ADP binding to the NBD alters the substrate-binding affinity of the SBD, triggering functionally essential cycles of substrate binding and release. The interdomain linker is a well-structured participant in the interdomain interface in ATP-bound Hsp70s. By contrast, in the ADP-bound state, exemplified by the Escherichia coli Hsp70 DnaK, the interdomain linker is flexible. Hsp70 interdomain linker sequences are highly conserved; moreover, mutations in this region compromise interdomain allostery. To better understand the role of this region in Hsp70 allostery, we used molecular dynamics simulations to explore the conformational landscape of the interdomain linker in ADP-bound DnaK and supported our simulations by strategic experimental data. We found that while the interdomain linker samples many conformations, it behaves as three relatively ordered segments connected by hinges. As a consequence, the distances and orientations between the NBD and SBD are limited. Additionally, the C-terminal region of the linker forms previously unreported, transient interactions with the SBD, and the predominant linker-docking site is available in only one allosteric state, that with high affinity for substrate. This preferential binding implicates the interdomain linker as a dynamic allosteric switch. The linker-binding site on the SBD is a potential target for small molecule modulators of the Hsp70 allosteric cycle."

They not only increase the risk of chronic diseases but they are also associated with adverse perinatal, neonatal, infant and child outcomes. The objective of this study was to examine the trend of overweight and obesity among Bangladeshi women of reproductive age between 2004 and 2014.This is a secondary data analysis of the 2004, 2007, 2011 and 2014 Bangladesh Demographic and Health Surveys (BDHS). We determined the age standardized prevalence of overweight and obesity of women aged 15-49 years, who had their weight and height measured. Overweight and obesity were determined using the Asian specific BMI cut-offs criteria.The prevalence of overweight increased from 11.4% [95% CI: 10.4to 12.5] in 2004 to 25.2% [95% CI: 24.0 to 26.4] in 2014. The prevalence of obesity increased from 3.5% [95% CI: 3.0to4.2] to 11.2% [95% CI: 10.1to12.5%] over the same period of time. This was seen in all age groups. However, the greatest increase was observed in women aged 35 to 49 years. The highest prevalence of overweight and obesity were observed in those women with the highest education level and wealth, larger family size, living in urban areas and not being in paid employment.The prevalence of overweight and obesity among women of reproductive age in Bangladesh is high and increasing. We speculate that this has the potential to jeopardize the improvements that have been made in maternal and infant health over the last two decades.

PARP1-mediated senescence rescue was accompanied by transcriptional activation of the melanocyte-lineage survival oncogene MITF, highlighting a new role for PARP1 in melanomagenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2741448443,"Spermatogenesis is a highly coordinated process that requires tightly regulated gene expression programmed by transcription factors and epigenetic modifiers. In this study, we found that nuclear respiratory factor (NRF)-1, a key transcription factor for mitochondrial biogenesis, cooperated with DNA methylation to directly regulate the expression of multiple germ cell–specific genes, including Asz1. In addition, conditional ablation of NRF1 in gonocytes dramatically down-regulated these germline genes, blocked germ cell proliferation, and subsequently led to male infertility in mice. Our data highlight a precise crosstalk between transcriptional regulation by NRF1 and epigenetic modulation during germ cell development and unequivocally demonstrate a novel role of NRF1 in spermatogenesis.—Wang, J., Tang, C., Wang, Q., Su, J., Ni, T., Yang, W., Wang, Y., Chen, W., Liu, X., Wang, S., Zhang, J., Song, H., Zhu, J., Wang, Y.

We investigated whether ovarian cancer metabolism could provide insight into the development of therapeutic strategies. We performed immunohistochemical staining for PKM2 on a tissue microarray for multivariate analysis. It revealed that patients exhibiting higher PKM2 expression were significantly associated with malignancy groups (p < 0.001) and pathogenesis models (p < 0.001), had poor progression-free survival rates (p = 0.01) as compared with patients exhibiting lower PKM2 levels, and yielded a hazard ratio of death of 2.02 (95% confidence interval: 0.70-5.85). In cell lines, PKM2 inhibitor significantly inhibited the glycolytic rate according to cellular glucose consumption (p < 0.001). We also utilized Seahorse assays to assess metabolism-related cell-specific factors and the impact of PKM2 inhibitors. Energy shifts as per Seahorse analysis showed attenuation of the extracellular acidification rate (p < 0.05) and no significant difference in oxygen-consumption rate in SKOV3 cells. Treatment with PKM2 inhibitor suppressed ovarian cancer growth and cell migration in vitro and inhibited tumor growth without significant toxicity in a xenograft study. PKM2 inhibition disturbed Warburg effects and inhibited ovarian cancer cell growth. Targeting PKM2 may constitute a promising therapy for patients with ovarian cancer, and clinical trials involving shikonin are warranted."

Here we investigate functional diversity among neurons in the anterior fundus (AF) face patch, combining whole-brain fMRI with longitudinal single-unit recordings in a local population (<1 mm3). For each cell, we computed a whole-brain correlation map based on its shared time course with voxels throughout the brain during naturalistic movie viewing. Based on this mapping, neighboring neurons showed markedly different affiliation with distant visually responsive areas and fell coarsely into subpopulations. Of these, only one subpopulation (∼16% of neurons) yielded similar correlation maps to the local fMRI signal. The results employ the readout of large-scale fMRI networks and, by indicating multiple functional domains within a single voxel, present a new view of functional diversity within a local neural population."
https://openalex.org/W2740428338,"Current anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) therapy for oral cancer does not provide satisfactory efficacy due to drug resistance or reduced EGFR level. As an alternative candidate target for therapy, here we identified an oncogene, ROS1, as an important driver for oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) metastasis. Among tumors from 188 oral cancer patients, upregulated ROS1 expression strongly correlated with metastasis to lung and lymph nodes. Mechanistic studies uncover that the activated ROS1 results from highly expressed ROS1 gene instead of gene rearrangement, a phenomenon distinct from other cancers. Our data further reveal a novel mechanism that reduced histone methyltransferase EZH2 leads to a lower trimethylation of histone H3 lysine 27 suppressive modification, relaxes chromatin, and promotes the accessibility of the transcription factor STAT1 to the enhancer and the intron regions of ROS1 target genes, CXCL1 and GLI1, for upregulating their expressions. Down-regulation of ROS1 in highly invasive OSCC cells, nevertheless, reduces cell proliferation and inhibits metastasis to lung in the tail-vein injection and the oral cavity xenograft models. Our findings highlight ROS1 as a candidate biomarker and therapeutic target for OSCC. Finally, we demonstrate that co-targeting of ROS1 and EGFR could potentially offer an effective oral cancer therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2740893804,"A compensatory increase in β-cell mass occurs during pregnancy to counter the associated insulin resistance, and a failure in adaptation is thought to contribute to gestational diabetes. Insulin-expressing but glucose-transporter-2-low (Ins+Glut2LO) progenitor cells are present in mouse and human pancreas, being predominantly located in extra-islet β-cell clusters, and contribute to the regeneration of the endocrine pancreas following induced ablation. We therefore sought to investigate the contribution of Ins+Glut2LO cells to β-cell mass expansion during pregnancy. Female C57Bl/6 mice were time mated and pancreata were collected at gestational days (GD) 6, 9, 12, 15, and 18, and postpartum D7 (n = 4/time-point) and compared to control (non-pregnant) animals. Beta cell mass, location, proliferation (Ki67+), and proportion of Ins+Glut2LO cells were measured using immunohistochemistry and bright field or confocal microscopy. Beta cell mass tripled by GD18 and β-cell proliferation peaked at GD12 in islets (≥6 β-cells) and small β-cell clusters (1-5 β-cells). The proportion and fraction of Ins+Glut2LO cells undergoing proliferation increased significantly at GD9 in both islets and clusters, preceding the increase in β-cell mass and proliferation, and their proliferation within clusters persisted until GD15. The overall number of clusters increased significantly at GD9. Quantitative PCR showed a significant increase in Pdx1 presence at GD9 vs. GD18 or control pancreas, and Pdx1 was visualized by immunohistochemistry within both Ins+Glut2LO and Ins+Glut2HI cells within clusters. These results indicate that Ins+Glut2LO cells are likely to contribute to β-cell mass expansion during pregnancy."

https://openalex.org/W2740099263,"The pyrophosphate analog imidodiphosphate (PNP) alters the reaction equilibrium of human DNA polymerase β, and the resulting increase in the rate of pyrophosphorolysis enables kinetic and structural dissection of this reverse reaction of the enzyme. DNA polymerases catalyze efficient and high-fidelity DNA synthesis. While this reaction favors nucleotide incorporation, polymerases also catalyze a reverse reaction, pyrophosphorolysis, that removes the DNA primer terminus and generates deoxynucleoside triphosphates. Because pyrophosphorolysis can influence polymerase fidelity and sensitivity to chain-terminating nucleosides, we analyzed pyrophosphorolysis with human DNA polymerase β and found the reaction to be inefficient. The lack of a thio-elemental effect indicated that this reaction was limited by a nonchemical step. Use of a pyrophosphate analog, in which the bridging oxygen is replaced with an imido group (PNP), increased the rate of the reverse reaction and displayed a large thio-elemental effect, indicating that chemistry was now rate determining. Time-lapse crystallography with PNP captured structures consistent with a chemical equilibrium favoring the reverse reaction. These results highlight the importance of the bridging atom between the β- and γ-phosphates of the incoming nucleotide in reaction chemistry, enzyme conformational changes, and overall reaction equilibrium."
https://openalex.org/W2739173570,"Biophysical and structural analyses reveal how the glycosylase AlkD utilizes a mechanism of excision that does not involve base flipping to enable an alternative repair pathway for large yatakemycin–DNA adducts. Yatakemycin (YTM) is an extraordinarily toxic DNA alkylating agent with potent antimicrobial and antitumor properties and is the most recent addition to the CC-1065 and duocarmycin family of natural products. Though bulky DNA lesions the size of those produced by YTM are normally removed from the genome by the nucleotide-excision repair (NER) pathway, YTM adducts are also a substrate for the bacterial DNA glycosylases AlkD and YtkR2, unexpectedly implicating base-excision repair (BER) in their elimination. The reason for the extreme toxicity of these lesions and the molecular basis for the way they are eliminated by BER have been unclear. Here, we describe the structural and biochemical properties of YTM adducts that are responsible for their toxicity, and define the mechanism by which they are excised by AlkD. These findings delineate an alternative strategy for repair of bulky DNA damage and establish the cellular utility of this pathway relative to that of NER."

https://openalex.org/W2740369416,"The ability to acquire water from the soil is a major driver in interspecific plant competition and it depends on several root functional traits. One of these traits is the excretion of gel-like compounds (mucilage) that modify physical soil properties. Mucilage secreted by roots becomes hydrophobic upon drying, impedes the rewetting of the soil close to the root, the so called rhizosphere, and reduces water availability to plants. The function of rhizosphere hydrophobicity is not easily understandable when looking at a single plant, but it may constitute a competitive advantage at the ecosystem level. We hypothesize that by making the top soil hydrophobic, deep-rooted plants avoid competititon with shallow-rooted plants. To test this hypothesis we used an individual-based model to simulate water uptake and growth of two virtual plant species, one deep-rooted plant capable of making the soil hydrophobic and a shallow-rooted plant. We ran scenarios with different precipitation regimes ranging from dry to wet (350, 700, and 1400 mm total annual precipitation) and from high to low precipitation frequencies (1, 7, and 14 days). Plant species abundance and biomass were chosen as indicators for competitiveness of plant species. At constant precipitation frequency mucilage hydrophobicity lead to a benefit in biomass and abundance of the tap-rooted population. Under wet conditions this effect diminished and tap-rooted plants were less productive. Without this trait both species coexisted. The effect of root exudation trait remained constant under different precipitation frequencies. This study shows that mucilage secretion is a competitive trait for the acquisition of water. This advantage is achieved by the modification of the soil hydraulic properties and specifically by inducing water repellency in soil regions which are shared with other species."
https://openalex.org/W2740963940,"An alternative route for pancreatic islet transplantation is the subcutaneous space; however, inadequate vascularization in the subcutaneous space limits the availability of oxygen and nutrients to the subcutaneously transplanted islets, which leads to the development of a necrotic core in the islets, thereby causing islet dysfunction. Thus, we aimed to prevent the early apoptosis of pancreatic islets after transplantation into subcutaneous space by preparing islet clusters of appropriate size. We prepared fully functional islet cell clusters (ICCs) by using the hanging-drop technique. We optimized the size of ICCs on the basis of viability and functionality after culture in an hypoxic environment. We transplanted ICCs into the subcutaneous space of diabetic mice and evaluated the viability of the islets at the transplantation site. In an hypoxic environment, ICCs exhibited improved viability and functionality compared with control islets. ICCs, upon transplantation into the hypoxic subcutaneous space of diabetic mice, showed better glycemic control compared with control islets. Live/dead imaging of the islets after retrieval from the transplanted area revealed significantly reduced apoptosis in ICCs. Transplantation of ICCs may be an attractive strategy to prevent islet cell apoptosis that results from nonimmune-mediated physiologic stress at the transplantation site.—Pathak, S., Regmi, S., Gupta, B., Pham, T.

https://openalex.org/W2741656129,"The ubiquitin-associated protein 2–like (UBAP2L) gene remains poorly studied in human and mouse development. UBAP2L interacts with the Polycomb group protein B lymphoma Mo-MLV insertion region 1 homolog (BMI1) and determines the activity of mouse hematopoietic stem cells in vivo. Here we show that loss of Ubap2l leads to disorganized respiratory epithelium of mutant neonates, which die of respiratory failure. We also show that UBAP2L overexpression leads to epithelial-mesenchymal transition–like phenotype in a non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) cell line. UBAP2L is amplified in 15% of human primary lung adenocarcinoma specimens. Such patients express higher levels of UBAP2L and show a reduction in survival when compared with those who do not have this gene amplification. Supporting a possible role for UBAP2L in lung tumor progression, NSCLC cells engineered to express low levels of this gene produce much smaller tumors in vivo than wild-type control cells. Together, these results suggest that UBAP2L contributes to epithelial lung cell identity in mice and that it plays an important role in human lung adenocarcinoma.—Aucagne, R., Girard, S., Mayotte, N., Lehnertz, B., Lopes-Paciencia, S., Gendron, P., Boucher, G., Chagraoui, J., Sauvageau, G.

https://openalex.org/W2740778459,"Essential proteins are the proteins that are indispensable to the survival and development of an organism. Deleting a single essential protein will cause lethality or infertility. Identifying and analysing essential proteins are key to understanding the molecular mechanisms of living cells. There are two types of methods for predicting essential proteins: experimental methods, which require considerable time and resources, and computational methods, which overcome the shortcomings of experimental methods. However, the prediction accuracy of computational methods for essential proteins requires further improvement. In this paper, we propose a new computational strategy named CoTB for identifying essential proteins based on a combination of topological properties, subcellular localization information and orthologous protein information. First, we introduce several topological properties of the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network. Second, we propose new methods for measuring orthologous information and subcellular localization and a new computational strategy that uses a random forest prediction model to obtain a probability score for the proteins being essential. Finally, we conduct experiments on four different Saccharomyces cerevisiae datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that our strategy for identifying essential proteins outperforms traditional computational methods and the most recently developed method, SON. In particular, our strategy improves the prediction accuracy to 89, 78, 79, and 85 percent on the YDIP, YMIPS, YMBD and YHQ datasets at the top 100 level, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W2741308454,"Malignant mesothelioma (MM) is an aggressive malignancy, highly resistant to current medical and surgical therapies, whose tumor cells characteristically show a high level of aneuploidy and genomic instability. We tested our hypothesis that targeting chromosomal instability in MM would improve response to therapy. Thr/Tyr kinase (TTK)/monopolar spindle 1 kinase (Mps-1) is a kinase of the spindle assembly checkpoint that controls cell division and cell fate. CFI-402257 is a novel, selective inhibitor of Mps-1 with antineoplastic activity. We found that CFI-402257 suppresses MM growth. We found that Mps-1 is overexpressed in MM and that its expression correlates with poor patients’ outcome. In vitro, CFI-402257-mediated inhibition of Mps-1 resulted in abrogation of the mitotic checkpoint, premature progression through mitosis, marked aneuploidy and mitotic catastrophe. In vivo, CFI-402257 reduced MM growth in an orthotopic, syngeneic model, when used as a single agent, and more so when used in combination with cisplatin+pemetrexed, the current standard of care.

https://openalex.org/W2741033623,"The spatial scan statistic is an important tool for spatial cluster detection. There have been numerous studies on scanning window shapes. However, little research has been done on the maximum scanning window size or maximum reported cluster size. Recently, Han et al. proposed to use the Gini coefficient to optimize the maximum reported cluster size. However, the method has been developed and evaluated only for the Poisson model. We adopt the Gini coefficient to be applicable to the spatial scan statistic for ordinal data to determine the optimal maximum reported cluster size. Through a simulation study and application to a real data example, we evaluate the performance of the proposed approach. With some sophisticated modification, the Gini coefficient can be effectively employed for the ordinal model. The Gini coefficient most often picked the optimal maximum reported cluster sizes that were the same as or smaller than the true cluster sizes with very high accuracy. It seems that we can obtain a more refined collection of clusters by using the Gini coefficient. The Gini coefficient developed specifically for the ordinal model can be useful for optimizing the maximum reported cluster size for ordinal data and helpful for properly and informatively discovering cluster patterns."
https://openalex.org/W2741561754,"Streptococcus suis serotype 2 is an important porcine bacterial pathogen and emerging zoonotic agent mainly responsible for sudden death, septic shock, and meningitis. However, serotype 2 strains are genotypically and phenotypically heterogeneous. Though a multitude of virulence factors have been described for S. suis serotype 2, the lack of a clear definition regarding which ones are truly “critical” has created inconsistencies that have only recently been highlighted. Herein, the involvement of two factors previously described as being critical for S. suis serotype 2 virulence, whether the dipeptidyl peptidase IV and autolysin, were evaluated with regards to different ascribed functions using prototype strains belonging to important sequence types. Results demonstrate a lack of reproducibility with previously published data. In fact, the role of the dipeptidyl peptidase IV and autolysin as critical virulence factors could not be confirmed. Though certain in vitro functions may be ascribed to these factors, their roles are not unique for S. suis, probably due to compensation by other factors. As such, variations and discrepancies in experimental design, including in vitro assays, cell lines, and animal models, are an important source of differences between results. Moreover, the use of different sequence types in this study demonstrates that the role attributed to a virulence factor may vary according to the S. suis serotype 2 strain background. Consequently, it is necessary to establish standard experimental designs according to the experiment and purpose in order to facilitate comparison between laboratories. Alongside, studies should include strains of diverse origins in order to prevent erroneous and biased conclusions that could affect future studies."

A Support Vector Machine classifier was applied to the set of tweets to remove those unlikely to be related to ILI. Time series of the pooled set of remaining tweets involving any term, of tweets involving individual terms, and of the ICD-9 data were constructed, and temporal cross-correlation between the social media and clinical data was computed. A statistically significant correlation (Spearman ρ = 0.23) between tweets involving the term flu and ED and UCC volume related to ILI 11 days in the future was observed. Tweets involving the terms coughing (Spearman ρ = 0.24) and headache (Spearman ρ = 0.19) individually were also significantly correlated to ILI-related clinical volume four and two days in the future, respectively.

https://openalex.org/W2742091186,"There remains a large discrepancy between the known genetic contributions to cancer and that which can be explained by genomic variants, both inherited and somatic. Recently, understudied repetitive DNA regions called microsatellites have been identified as genetic risk markers for a number of diseases including various cancers (breast, ovarian and brain). In this study, we demonstrate an integrated process for identifying and further evaluating microsatellite-based risk markers for lung cancer using data from the cancer genome atlas and the 1000 genomes project. Comparing whole-exome germline sequencing data from 488 TCGA lung cancer samples to germline exome data from 390 control samples from the 1000 genomes project, we identified 119 potentially informative microsatellite loci. These loci were found to be able to distinguish between cancer and control samples with sensitivity and specificity ratios over 0.8. Then these loci, supplemented with additional loci from other cancers and controls, were evaluated using a target enrichment kit and sample-multiplexed nextgen sequencing. Thirteen of the 119 risk markers were found to be informative in a well powered study (>0.99 for a 0.95 confidence interval) using high-depth (579x±315) nextgen sequencing of 30 lung cancer and 89 control samples, resulting in sensitivity and specificity ratios of 0.90 and 0.94, respectively. When 8 loci harvested from the bioinformatic analysis of other cancers are added to the classifier, then the sensitivity and specificity rise to 0.93 and 0.97, respectively. Analysis of the genes harboring these loci revealed two genes (ARID1B and REL) and two significantly enriched pathways (chromatin organization and cellular stress response) suggesting that the process of lung carcinogenesis is linked to chromatin remodeling, inflammation, and tumor microenvironment restructuring. We illustrate that high-depth sequencing enables a high-precision microsatellite-based risk classifier analysis approach. This microsatellite-based platform confirms the potential to create clinically actionable diagnostics for lung cancer."

https://openalex.org/W2740328753,"Employing Random Matrix Theory and Principal Component Analysis techniques, we enlarge our work on the individual and cross-sectional intraday statistical properties of trading volume in financial markets to the study of collective intraday features of that financial observable. Our data consist of the trading volume of the Dow Jones Industrial Average Index components spanning the years between 2003 and 2014. Computing the intraday time dependent correlation matrices and their spectrum of eigenvalues, we show there is a mode ruling the collective behaviour of the trading volume of these stocks whereas the remaining eigenvalues are within the bounds established by random matrix theory, except the second largest eigenvalue which is robustly above the upper bound limit at the opening and slightly above it during the morning-afternoon transition. Taking into account that for price fluctuations it was reported the existence of at least seven significant eigenvalues-and that its autocorrelation function is close to white noise for highly liquid stocks whereas for the trading volume it lasts significantly for more than 2 hours -, our finding goes against any expectation based on those features, even when we take into account the Epps effect. In addition, the weight of the trading volume collective mode is intraday dependent; its value increases as the trading session advances with its eigenversor approaching the uniform vector as well, which corresponds to a soar in the behavioural homogeneity. With respect to the nonstationarity of the collective features of the trading volume we observe that after the financial crisis of 2008 the coherence function shows the emergence of an upset profile with large fluctuations from that year on, a property that concurs with the modification of the average trading volume profile we noted in our previous individual analysis."
