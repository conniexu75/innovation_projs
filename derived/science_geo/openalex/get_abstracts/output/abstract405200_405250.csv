https://openalex.org/W2144405991,"Differential expression of maternally and paternally inherited alleles of a gene is referred to as gene imprinting, a form of epigenetic gene regulation common to flowering plants and mammals. In plants, imprinting primarily occurs in the endosperm, a seed tissue that supports the embryo during its growth and development. Previously, we demonstrated that widespread DNA demethylation at remnants of transposable elements accompanies endosperm development and that a subset of these methylation changes are associated with gene imprinting. Here we assay imprinted gene expression genome-wide by performing high-throughput sequencing of RNA derived from seeds of reciprocal intraspecific crosses. We identify more than 200 loci that exhibit parent-of-origin effects on gene expression in the endosperm, including a large number of transcription factors, hormone biosynthesis and response genes, and genes that encode regulators of epigenetic information, such as methylcytosine binding proteins, histone methyltransferases, and chromatin remodelers. The majority of these genes are partially, rather than completely, imprinted, suggesting that gene dosage regulation is an important aspect of imprinted gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W2034218807,"Recent studies have shown that autophagy is essential for proper β-cell function and survival. However, it is yet unclear under what pathogenic conditions autophagy is inhibited in β-cells. Here, we report that long term exposure to fatty acids and glucose block autophagic flux in β-cells, contributing to their toxic effect. INS1 cells expressing GFP-LC3 (an autophagosome marker) were treated with 0.4 mm palmitate, 0.4 mm oleate, and various concentrations of glucose for 22 h. Kinetics of the effect of fatty acids on autophagy showed a biphasic response. During the second phase of autophagy, the size of autophagosomes and the content of autophagosome substrates (GFP-LC3, p62) and endogenous LC3 was increased. During the same phase, fatty acids suppressed autophagic degradation of long lived protein in both INS1 cells and islets. In INS1 cells, palmitate induced a 3-fold decrease in the number and the acidity of Acidic Vesicular Organelles. This decrease was associated with a suppression of hydrolase activity, suppression of endocytosis, and suppression of oxidative phosphorylation. The combination of fatty acids with glucose synergistically suppressed autophagic turnover, concomitantly suppressing insulin secretion. Rapamycin treatment resulted in partial reversal of the inhibition of autophagic flux, the inhibition of insulin secretion, and the increase in cell death. Our results indicate that excess nutrient could impair autophagy in the long term, hence contributing to nutrient-induced β-cell dysfunction. This may provide a novel mechanism that connects diet-induced obesity and diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W2042744684,"Matrin 3 (MATR3) is a highly conserved, inner nuclear matrix protein with two zinc finger domains and two RNA recognition motifs (RRM), whose function is largely unknown. Recently we found MATR3 to be phosphorylated by the protein kinase ATM, which activates the cellular response to double strand breaks in the DNA. Here, we show that MATR3 interacts in an RNA-dependent manner with several proteins with established roles in RNA processing, and maintains its interaction with RNA via its RRM2 domain. Deep sequencing of the bound RNA (RIP-seq) identified several small noncoding RNA species. Using microarray analysis to explore MATR3's role in transcription, we identified 77 transcripts whose amounts depended on the presence of MATR3. We validated this finding with nine transcripts which were also bound to the MATR3 complex. Finally, we demonstrated the importance of MATR3 for maintaining the stability of several of these mRNA species and conclude that it has a role in mRNA stabilization. The data suggest that the cellular level of MATR3, known to be highly regulated, modulates the stability of a group of gene transcripts."
https://openalex.org/W2015720788,"Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with L858R or exon 19 deletion mutations in epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) have good responses to the tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), gefitinib. However, patients with wild-type EGFR and acquired mutation in EGFR T790M are resistant to gefitinib treatment. Here, we showed that curcumin can improve the efficiency of gefitinib in the resistant NSCLC cells both in vitro and in vivo models.After screening 598 herbal and natural compounds, we found curcumin could inhibit cell proliferation in different gefitinib-resistant NSCLC cell lines; concentration-dependently down-regulate EGFR phosphorylation through promoting EGFR degradation in NSCLC cell lines with wild-type EGFR or T790M EGFR. In addition, the anti-tumor activity of gefitinib was potentiated via curcumin through blocking EGFR activation and inducing apoptosis in gefitinib-resistant NSCLC cell lines; also the combined treatment with curcumin and gefitinib exhibited significant inhibition in the CL1-5, A549 and H1975 xenografts tumor growth in SCID mice through reducing EGFR, c-MET, cyclin D1 expression, and inducing apoptosis activation through caspases-8, 9 and PARP. Interestingly, we observed that the combined treatment group represented better survival rate and less intestinal mucosal damage compare to gefitinib-alone therapy. We showed that curcumin attenuated the gefitinib-induced cell proliferation inhibition and apoptosis through altering p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activation in intestinal epithelia cell.Curcumin potentiates antitumor activity of gefitinib in cell lines and xenograft mice model of NSCLC through inhibition of proliferation, EGFR phosphorylation, and induction EGFR ubiquitination and apoptosis. In addition, curcumin attenuates gefitinib-induced gastrointestinal adverse effects via altering p38 activation. These findings provide a novel treatment strategy that curcumin as an adjuvant to increase the spectrum of the usage of gefitinib and overcome the gefitinib inefficiency in NSCLC patients."
https://openalex.org/W2125775109,"Long-lasting mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) openings damage mitochondria, but transient mPTP openings protect against chronic cardiac stress. To probe the mechanism, we subjected isolated cardiac mitochondria to gradual Ca(2+) loading, which, in the absence of BSA, induced long-lasting mPTP opening, causing matrix depolarization. However, with BSA present to mimic cytoplasmic fatty acid-binding proteins, the mitochondrial population remained polarized and functional, even after matrix Ca(2+) release caused an extramitochondrial free [Ca(2+)] increase to >10 μM, unless mPTP openings were inhibited. These findings could be explained by asynchronous transient mPTP openings allowing individual mitochondria to depolarize long enough to flush accumulated matrix Ca(2+) and then to repolarize rapidly after pore closure. Because subsequent matrix Ca(2+) reuptake via the Ca(2+) uniporter is estimated to be >100-fold slower than matrix Ca(2+) release via mPTP, only a tiny fraction of mitochondria (<1%) are depolarized at any given time. Our results show that transient mPTP openings allow cardiac mitochondria to defend themselves collectively against elevated cytoplasmic Ca(2+) levels as long as respiratory chain activity is able to balance proton influx with proton pumping. We found that transient mPTP openings also stimulated reactive oxygen species production, which may engage reactive oxygen species-dependent cardioprotective signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2029837060,"Ticks are monophyletic and composed of the hard (Ixodidae) and soft (Argasidae) tick families, as well as the Nuttalliellidae, a family with a single species, Nuttalliella namaqua. Significant biological differences in lifestyle strategies for hard and soft ticks suggest that various blood-feeding adaptations occurred after their divergence. The phylogenetic relationships between the tick families have not yet been resolved due to the lack of molecular data for N. namaqua. This tick possesses a pseudo-scutum and apical gnathostoma as observed for ixodids, has a leathery cuticle similar to argasids and has been considered the evolutionary missing link between the two families. Little knowledge exists with regard to its feeding biology or host preferences. Data on its biology and systematic relationship to the other tick families could therefore be crucial in understanding the evolution of blood-feeding behaviour in ticks. Live specimens were collected and blood meal analysis showed the presence of DNA for girdled lizards from the Cordylid family. Feeding of ticks on lizards showed that engorgement occurred rapidly, similar to argasids, but that blood meal concentration occurs via malpighian excretion of water. Phylogenetic analysis of the 18S nuclear and 16S mitochondrial genes indicate that N. namaqua grouped basal to the main tick families. The data supports the monophyly of all tick families and suggests the evolution of argasid-like blood-feeding behaviour in the ancestral tick lineage. Based on the data and considerations from literature we propose an origin for ticks in the Karoo basin of Gondwanaland during the late Permian. The nuttalliellid family almost became extinct during the End Permian event, leaving N. namaqua as the closest living relative to the ancestral tick lineage and the evolutionary missing link between the tick families."
https://openalex.org/W2046913227,"Background There is an urgent need to measure phosphorylated cell signaling proteins in cancer tissue for the individualization of molecular targeted kinase inhibitor therapy. However, phosphoproteins fluctuate rapidly following tissue procurement. Snap-freezing preserves phosphoproteins, but is unavailable in most clinics and compromises diagnostic morphology. Formalin fixation preserves tissue histomorphology, but penetrates tissue slowly, and is unsuitable for stabilizing phosphoproteins. We originated and evaluated a novel one-step biomarker and histology preservative (BHP) chemistry that stabilizes signaling protein phosphorylation and retains formalin-like tissue histomorphology with equivalent immunohistochemistry in a single paraffin block. Results Total protein yield extracted from BHP-fixed, routine paraffin-embedded mouse liver was 100% compared to snap-frozen tissue. The abundance of 14 phosphorylated proteins was found to be stable over extended fixation times in BHP fixed paraffin embedded human colon mucosa. Compared to matched snap-frozen tissue, 8 phosphoproteins were equally preserved in mouse liver, while AMPKβ1 Ser108 was slightly elevated after BHP fixation. More than 25 tissues from mouse, cat and human specimens were evaluated for preservation of histomorphology. Selected tissues were evaluated in a multi-site, independent pathology review. Tissue fixed with BHP showed equivalent preservation of cytoplasmic and membrane cytomorphology, with significantly better nuclear chromatin preservation by BHP compared to formalin. Immunohistochemical staining of 13 non-phosphorylated proteins, including estrogen receptor alpha, progesterone receptor, Ki-67 and Her2, was equal to or stronger in BHP compared to formalin. BHP demonstrated significantly improved immunohistochemical detection of phosphorylated proteins ERK Thr202/Tyr204, GSK3-α/β Ser21/Ser9, p38-MAPK Thr180/Tyr182, eIF4G Ser1108 and Acetyl-CoA Carboxylase Ser79. Conclusion In a single paraffin block BHP preserved the phosphorylation state of several signaling proteins at a level comparable to snap-freezing, while maintaining the full diagnostic immunohistochemical and histomorphologic detail of formalin fixation. This new tissue fixative has the potential to greatly facilitate personalized medicine, biobanking, and phospho-proteomic research."
https://openalex.org/W2058396569,"Forkhead box M1 (FOXM1) is a proliferation-associated transcription factor essential for cell cycle progression. Numerous studies have documented that FOXM1 has multiple functions in tumorigenesis and its elevated levels are frequently associated with cancer progression. Here, we characterized the role of ERK/FOXM1 signaling in mediating the metastatic potential of ovarian cancer cells. Immunohistochemical (IHC), immunoblotting and semi-quantitative RT-PCR analyses found that both phospho-ERK and FOXM1 were frequently upregulated in ovarian cancers. Intriguingly, the overexpressed phospho-ERK (p<0.001) and FOXM1 (p<0.001) were significantly correlated to high-grade ovarian tumors with aggressive behavior such as metastasized lymph node (5 out of 6). Moreover, the expressions of phospho-ERK and FOXM1 had significantly positive correlation (p<0.001). Functionally, ectopic expression of FOXM1B remarkably enhanced cell migration/invasion, while FOXM1C not only increased cell proliferation but also promoted cell migration/invasion. Conversely, inhibition of FOXM1 expression by either thiostrepton or U0126 could significantly impair FOXM1 mediated oncogenic capacities. However, the down-regulation of FOXM1 by either thiostrepton or U0126 required the presence of p53 in ovarian cancer cells. Collectively, our data suggest that over-expression of FOXM1 might stem from the constitutively active ERK which confers the metastatic capabilities to ovarian cancer cells. The impairment of metastatic potential of cancer cells by FOXM1 inhibitors underscores its therapeutic value in advanced ovarian tumors."
https://openalex.org/W1967946848,"Quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) is a widely used technique for gene expression analysis. Its reliability is highly dependent upon selection of the appropriate reference genes for accurate gene expression normalization. In this study, we investigated the expression stability of 10 commonly used reference genes in a mouse myocardial infarction model.The expression stability of the 10 reference genes (Actb, B2m, Eef1a1, Gapdh, Hprt, Polr2a, Ppia, Rpl13a, Tbp, Tpt1) was analyzed using the geNorm software. Overall, the combination of Hprt, Rpl13a and Tpt1 was the most stable reference gene set in our experiments. Gapdh, Polr2a and Actb consistently showed the highest gene expression variability and the expression levels of Gapdh, Polr2a, Actb, B2m and Eef1a1 were found to be selectively up- or downregulated after myocardial infarction. We normalized the expression of Nppb and Vcam1, using different reference gene strategies and demonstrated that their induction after myocardial infarction was most clearly revealed with the optimal reference gene combination. However, the use of suboptimal reference gene combinations resulted in detrimental effects on gene expression levels and variability with a gradual loss of the expression differences and a significant reduction in statistical power.Hprt, Rpl13a and Tpt1 are a set of stably expressed reference genes for accurate gene expression normalization in myocardial infarction studies in mice. We found that Gapdh, Polr2a and Actb display high expression variability in mouse myocardial infarction tissues and that loss of statistical power and increase in sample size are the evident consequences of choosing suboptimal combinations of reference genes. We furthermore caution against the use of Gapdh, Polr2a, Actb, B2m and Eef1a1 for gene expression normalization in myocardial infarction studies because of selective up- or downregulation after myocardial infarction, which could potentially lead to biased study outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W1986136141,"Background Yeast-like fungi inhabit soils throughout all climatic zones in a great abundance. While recent estimations predicted a plethora of prokaryotic taxa in one gram of soil, similar data are lacking for fungi, especially yeasts. Methodology/Principal Findings We assessed the diversity of soil yeasts in different forests of central Germany using cultivation-based techniques with subsequent identification based on rDNA sequence data. Based on experiments using various pre-cultivation sample treatment and different cultivation media we obtained the highest number of yeasts by analysing mixed soil samples with a single nutrient-rich medium. Additionally, several species richness estimators were applied to incidence-based data of 165 samples. All of them predicted a similar range of yeast diversity, namely 14 to 16 species. Randomized species richness curves reached saturation in all applied estimators, thus indicating that the majority of species is detected after approximately 30 to 50 samples analysed. Conclusions/Significance In this study we demonstrate that robust species identification as well as mathematical approaches are essential to reliably estimate the sampling effort needed to describe soil yeast communities. This approach has great potential for optimisation of cultivation techniques and allows high throughput analysis in the future."
https://openalex.org/W1991757639,"Transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1) is a ubiquitous type II membrane receptor with 61 amino acids in the N-terminal cytoplasmic region. TfR1 is highly expressed in cancer cells, particularly under iron deficient conditions. Overexpression of TfR1 is thought to meet the increased requirement of iron uptake necessary for cell growth. In the present study, we used transferrin (Tf), a known ligand of TfR1, and gambogic acid (GA), an apoptosis-inducing agent and newly identified TfR1 ligand to investigate the signaling role of TfR1 in breast cancer cells. We found that GA but not Tf induced apoptosis in a TfR1-dependent manner in breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cells. Estrogen receptor-positive MCF-7 cells lack caspase-3 and were not responsive to GA treatment. GA activated the three major signaling pathways of the MAPK family, as well as caspase-3, -8, and Poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase apoptotic pathway. Interestingly, only Src inhibitor PP2 greatly sensitized the cells to GA-mediated apoptosis. Further investigations by confocal fluorescence microscopy and immunoprecipitation revealed that Src and TfR1 are constitutively bound. Using TfR1-deficient CHO TRVB cells, point mutation studies showed that Tyr(20) within the (20)YTRF(23) motif of the cytoplasmic region of TfR1 is the phosphorylation site by Src. TfR1 Tyr(20) phosphomutants were more sensitive to GA-mediated apoptosis. Our results indicate that, albeit its iron uptake function, TfR1 is a signaling molecule and tyrosine phosphorylation at position 20 by Src enhances anti-apoptosis and potentiates breast cancer cell survival."
https://openalex.org/W2108580170,"Spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs) have the unique ability to undergo self-renewal division. However, these cells are morphologically indistinguishable from committed spermatogonia, which have limited mitotic activity. To establish a system for SSC purification, we analyzed the expression of SSC markers CD9 and epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EPCAM), both of which are also expressed on embryonic stem (ES) cells. We examined the correlation between their expression patterns and SSC activities.By magnetic cell sorting, we found that EPCAM-selected mouse germ cells have limited clonogenic potential in vitro. Moreover, these cells showed stronger expression of progenitor markers than CD9-selected cells, which are significantly more enriched in SSCs. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting of CD9-selected cells indicated a significantly higher frequency of SSCs among the CD9(+)EPCAM(low/-) population than among the CD9(+)EPCAM(+) population. Overexpression of the active form of EPCAM in germline stem (GS) cell cultures did not significantly influence SSC activity, whereas EPCAM suppression by short hairpin RNA compromised GS cell proliferation and increased the concentration of SSCs, as revealed by germ cell transplantation.These results show that SSCs are the most concentrated in CD9(+)EPCAM(low/-) population and also suggest that EPCAM plays an important role in progenitor cell amplification in the mouse spermatogenic system. The establishment of a method to distinguish progenitor spermatogonia from SSCs will be useful for developing an improved purification strategy for SSCs from testis cells."
https://openalex.org/W1984447473,"Mg2+ plays important roles in numerous cellular functions. Mitochondria take part in intracellular Mg2+ regulation and the Mg2+ concentration in mitochondria affects the synthesis of ATP. However, there are few methods to observe Mg2+ in mitochondria in intact cells. Here, we have developed a novel Mg2+–selective fluorescent probe, KMG-301, that is functional in mitochondria. This probe changes its fluorescence properties solely depending on the Mg2+ concentration in mitochondria under physiologically normal conditions. Simultaneous measurements using this probe together with a probe for cytosolic Mg2+, KMG-104, enabled us to compare the dynamics of Mg2+ in the cytosol and in mitochondria. With this method, carbonyl cyanide p-(trifluoromethoxy) phenylhydrazone (FCCP)–induced Mg2+ mobilization from mitochondria to the cytosol was visualized. Although a FCCP–induced decrease in the Mg2+ concentration in mitochondria and an increase in the cytosol were observed both in differentiated PC12 cells and in hippocampal neurons, the time-courses of concentration changes varied with cell type. Moreover, the relationship between mitochondrial Mg2+ and Parkinson's disease was analyzed in a cellular model of Parkinson's disease by using the 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium ion (MPP+). A gradual decrease in the Mg2+ concentration in mitochondria was observed in response to MPP+ in differentiated PC12 cells. These results indicate that KMG-301 is useful for investigating Mg2+ dynamics in mitochondria. All animal procedures to obtain neurons from Wistar rats were approved by the ethical committee of Keio University (permit number is 09106-(1))."
https://openalex.org/W2091013999,"Sandy beach ecological theory states that physical features of the beach control macrobenthic community structure on all but the most dissipative beaches. However, few studies have simultaneously evaluated the relative importance of physical, chemical and biological factors as potential explanatory variables for meso-scale spatio-temporal patterns of intertidal community structure in these systems. Here, we investigate macroinfaunal community structure of a micro-tidal sandy beach that is located on an oligotrophic subtropical coast and is influenced by seasonal estuarine input. We repeatedly sampled biological and environmental variables at a series of beach transects arranged at increasing distances from the estuary mouth. Sampling took place over a period of five months, corresponding with the transition between the dry and wet season. This allowed assessment of biological-physical relationships across chemical and nutritional gradients associated with a range of estuarine inputs. Physical, chemical, and biological response variables, as well as measures of community structure, showed significant spatio-temporal patterns. In general, bivariate relationships between biological and environmental variables were rare and weak. However, multivariate correlation approaches identified a variety of environmental variables (i.e., sampling session, the C∶N ratio of particulate organic matter, dissolved inorganic nutrient concentrations, various size fractions of photopigment concentrations, salinity and, to a lesser extent, beach width and sediment kurtosis) that either alone or combined provided significant explanatory power for spatio-temporal patterns of macroinfaunal community structure. Overall, these results showed that the macrobenthic community on Mtunzini Beach was not structured primarily by physical factors, but instead by a complex and dynamic blend of nutritional, chemical and physical drivers. This emphasises the need to recognise ocean-exposed sandy beaches as functional ecosystems in their own right."
https://openalex.org/W2089836914,"Enhanced airway contractility following inflammation by cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) or interleukin-13 (IL-13) involves increased intracellular Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i) levels in airway smooth muscle (ASM). In ASM, plasma membrane Ca2+ fluxes form a key component of [Ca2+]i regulation. There is now growing evidence that the bidirectional plasma membrane Na+/Ca2+ exchanger (NCX) contributes to ASM [Ca2+]i regulation. In the present study, we examined NCX expression and function in human ASM cells under normal conditions, and following exposure to TNFα or IL-13. Western blot analysis showed significant expression of the NCX1 isoform, with increased NCX1 levels by both cytokines, effects blunted by inhibitors of nuclear factor NF-κB or mitogen-activated protein kinase. Cytokine-mediated increase in NCX1 involved enhanced transcription followed by protein synthesis. NCX2 and NCX3 remained undetectable even in cytokine-stimulated ASM. In fura-2 loaded human ASM cells, NCX-mediated inward Ca2+ exchange as well as outward exchange (measured as rates of change in [Ca2+]i) was elicited by altering extracellular Na+ and Ca2+ levels. Contribution of NCX was verified by measuring [Na+]i using the fluorescent Na+ indicator SBFI. NCX-mediated inward exchange was verified by demonstrating prevention of rising [Ca2+]i or falling [Na+]i in the presence of the NCX inhibitor KBR7943. Inward exchange-mode NCX was increased by both TNFα and IL-13 to a greater extent than outward exchange. NCX siRNA transfection substantially blunted outward exchange and inward exchange modes. Finally, inhibition of NCX expression or function blunted peak [Ca2+]i and rate of fall of [Ca2+]i following histamine stimulation. These data suggest that NCX-mediated Ca2+ fluxes normally exist in human ASM (potentially contributing to rapid Ca2+ fluxes), and contribute to enhanced [Ca2+]i regulation in airway inflammation."
https://openalex.org/W2000608506,"Alzheimer's disease and other related neurodegenerative disorders known as tauopathies are characterized by the accumulation of abnormally phosphorylated and aggregated forms of the microtubule-associated protein tau. Several laboratories have identified a 17 kD proteolytic fragment of tau in degenerating neurons and in numerous cell culture models that is generated by calpain cleavage and speculated to contribute to tau toxicity. In the current study, we employed a Drosophila tauopathy model to investigate the importance of calpain-mediated tau proteolysis in contributing to tau neurotoxicity in an animal model of human neurodegenerative disease. We found that mutations that disrupted endogenous calpainA or calpainB activity in transgenic flies suppressed tau toxicity. Expression of a calpain-resistant form of tau in Drosophila revealed that mutating the putative calpain cleavage sites that produce the 17 kD fragment was sufficient to abrogate tau toxicity in vivo. Furthermore, we found significant toxicity in the fly retina associated with expression of only the 17 kD tau fragment. Collectively, our data implicate calpain-mediated proteolysis of tau as an important pathway mediating tau neurotoxicity in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2169085190,"The ability to understand similarities and analogies is a fundamental aspect of human advanced cognition. Although subject of considerable research in comparative cognition, the extent to which nonhuman species are capable of analogical reasoning is still debated. This study examined the conditions under which tufted capuchin monkeys (Cebus apella) acquire a same/different concept in a matching-to-sample task on the basis of relational similarity among multi-item stimuli. We evaluated (i) the ability of five capuchin monkeys to learn the same/different concept on the basis of the number of items composing the stimuli and (ii) the ability to match novel stimuli after training with both several small stimulus sets and a large stimulus set. We found the first evidence of same/different relational matching-to-sample abilities in a New World monkey and demonstrated that the ability to match novel stimuli is within the capacity of this species. Therefore, analogical reasoning can emerge in monkeys under specific training conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2095374622,"The neurobiological mechanisms of action underlying antidepressant drugs remain poorly understood. Desipramine (DMI) is an antidepressant classically characterized as an inhibitor of norepinephrine reuptake. Available evidence, however, suggests a mechanism more complex than simple reuptake inhibition. In the present study, we have characterized the direct interaction between DMI and the α(2A)-adrenergic receptor (α(2A)AR), a key regulator of noradrenergic neurotransmission with altered expression and function in depression. DMI alone was found to be sufficient to drive receptor internalization acutely and a robust down-regulation of α(2A)AR expression and signaling following prolonged stimulation in vitro. These effects are achieved through arrestin-biased regulation of the receptor, as DMI selectively induces recruitment of arrestin but not activation of heterotrimeric G proteins. Meanwhile, a physiologically relevant concentration of endogenous agonist (norepinephrine) was unable to sustain a down-regulation response. Prolonged in vivo administration of DMI resulted in significant down-regulation of synaptic α(2A)AR expression, a response that was lost in arrestin3-null animals. We contend that direct DMI-driven arrestin-mediated α(2A)AR down-regulation accounts for the therapeutically desirable but mechanistically unexplained adaptive alterations in receptor expression associated with this antidepressant. Our results provide novel insight into both the pharmacology of this antidepressant drug and the targeting of the α(2A)AR in depression."
https://openalex.org/W1991657674,"Mx proteins are a family of large GTPases that are induced exclusively by interferon-α/β and have a broad antiviral activity against several viruses, including influenza A virus (IAV). Although the antiviral activities of mouse Mx1 and human MxA have been studied extensively, the molecular mechanism of action remains largely unsolved. Because no direct interaction between Mx proteins and IAV proteins or RNA had been demonstrated so far, we addressed the question of whether Mx protein would interact with cellular proteins required for efficient replication of IAV. Immunoprecipitation of MxA revealed its association with two closely related RNA helicases, UAP56 and URH49. UAP56 and its paralog URH49 play an important role in IAV replication and are involved in nuclear export of IAV mRNAs and prevention of dsRNA accumulation in infected cells. In vitro binding assays with purified recombinant proteins revealed that MxA formed a direct complex with the RNA helicases. In addition, recombinant mouse Mx1 was also able to bind to UAP56 or URH49. Furthermore, the complex formation between cytoplasmic MxA and UAP56 or URH49 occurred in the perinuclear region, whereas nuclear Mx1 interacted with UAP56 or URH49 in distinct dots in the nucleus. Taken together, our data reveal that Mx proteins exerting antiviral activity can directly bind to the two cellular DExD/H box RNA helicases UAP56 and URH49. Moreover, the observed subcellular localization of the Mx-RNA helicase complexes coincides with the subcellular localization, where human MxA and mouse Mx1 proteins act antivirally. On the basis of these data, we propose that Mx proteins exert their antiviral activity against IAV by interfering with the function of the RNA helicases UAP56 and URH49."
https://openalex.org/W1965990047,"Activation of proteolytic cell death pathways may circumvent drug resistance in deadly protozoan parasites such as Plasmodium falciparum and Leishmania. To this end, it is important to define the cell death pathway(s) in parasites and thus characterize proteases such as metacaspases (MCA), which have been reported to induce cell death in plants and Leishmania parasites. We, therefore, investigated whether the cell death function of MCA is conserved in different protozoan parasite species such as Plasmodium falciparum and Leishmania major, focusing on the substrate specificity and functional role in cell survival as compared to Saccharomyces cerevisae. Our results show that, similarly to Leishmania, Plasmodium MCA exhibits a calcium-dependent, arginine-specific protease activity and its expression in yeast induced growth inhibition as well as an 82% increase in cell death under oxidative stress, a situation encountered by parasites during the host or when exposed to drugs such as artemisins. Furthermore, we show that MCA cell death pathways in both Plasmodium and Leishmania, involve a z-VAD-fmk inhibitable protease. Our data provide evidence that MCA from both Leishmania and Plasmodium falciparum is able to induce cell death in stress conditions, where it specifically activates a downstream enzyme as part of a cell death pathway. This enzymatic activity is also induced by the antimalarial drug chloroquine in erythrocytic stages of Plasmodium falciparum. Interestingly, we found that blocking parasite cell death influences their drug sensitivity, a result which could be used to create therapeutic strategies that by-pass drug resistance mechanisms by acting directly on the innate pathways of protozoan cell death."
https://openalex.org/W2033857798,"The type 1 inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (InsP(3)R1) is a ubiquitous intracellular Ca(2+) release channel that is vital to intracellular Ca(2+) signaling. InsP(3)R1 is a proteolytic target of calpain, which cleaves the channel to form a 95-kDa carboxyl-terminal fragment that includes the transmembrane domains, which contain the ion pore. However, the functional consequences of calpain proteolysis on channel behavior and Ca(2+) homeostasis are unknown. In the present study we have identified a unique calpain cleavage site in InsP(3)R1 and utilized a recombinant truncated form of the channel (capn-InsP(3)R1) corresponding to the stable, carboxyl-terminal fragment to examine the functional consequences of channel proteolysis. Single-channel recordings of capn-InsP(3)R1 revealed InsP(3)-independent gating and high open probability (P(o)) under optimal cytoplasmic Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+)](i)) conditions. However, some [Ca(2+)](i) regulation of the cleaved channel remained, with a lower P(o) in suboptimal and inhibitory [Ca(2+)](i). Expression of capn-InsP(3)R1 in N2a cells reduced the Ca(2+) content of ionomycin-releasable intracellular stores and decreased endoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) loading compared with control cells expressing full-length InsP(3)R1. Using a cleavage-specific antibody, we identified calpain-cleaved InsP(3)R1 in selectively vulnerable cerebellar Purkinje neurons after in vivo cardiac arrest. These findings indicate that calpain proteolysis of InsP(3)R1 generates a dysregulated channel that disrupts cellular Ca(2+) homeostasis. Furthermore, our results demonstrate that calpain cleaves InsP(3)R1 in a clinically relevant injury model, suggesting that Ca(2+) leak through the proteolyzed channel may act as a feed-forward mechanism to enhance cell death."
https://openalex.org/W2032886178,"Colorectal cancer is one of the most common cancers in developed nations and is the result of both environmental and genetic factors. Many of the genetic lesions observed in colorectal cancer alter expression of homeobox genes, which encode homeodomain transcription factors. The MEIS1 homeobox gene is known to be involved in several hematological malignancies and solid tumors and recent evidence suggests that expression of the MEIS1 transcript is altered in colorectal cancer. Despite this potential connection, little is known about the role of the gene in the intestines. We probed murine gastrointestinal tissue samples with an N-terminal Meis1 antibody, revealing expression of two previously described isoforms, as well as two novel Meis1 products. A 32 kD Meis1 product was expressed in the nuclei of non-epithelial cells in the stomach and colon, while a 27 kD product was expressed in the cytoplasm of epithelial cells in the proximal colon. Our data suggest that the 27 kD and 32 kD Meis1 proteins are both forms of the Meis1d protein, a homeodomain-less isoform whose transcript was previously identified in cDNA screens. Both the MEIS1D transcript and protein were expressed in human colon mucosa. Expression of the MEIS1D protein was downregulated in 83% (10/12) of primary colorectal cancer samples compared to matched normal mucosa, indicating that MEIS1D is a biomarker of colorectal tumorigenesis. The decreased expression of MEIS1D in colon tumors also suggests that this conserved homeodomain-less isoform may act as a tumor suppressor in human colorectal cancer."

The coreceptor usage by HIV varies from CCR5 (R5) tropic early in infection to CXCR4 (X4) tropic in later infections. Although the coreceptor switch from R5 to X4 tropic HIV is well associated with progression to AIDS, the role of CCR5 in disease progression especially in patients infected exclusively with R5 isolates throughout the disease remains enigmatic. To better understand the role of CCR5 and R5 tropic HIV envelope in AIDS pathogenesis, we asked whether the levels of CCR5 and/or HIV Env-mediated fusion determine apoptosis of bystander cells. We generated CD4+ T cell lines expressing varying levels of CCR5 on the cell surface to show that CCR5 expression levels correlate with bystander apoptosis induction. The mechanism of apoptosis involved caspase-3 activation and mitochondrial depolarization and was dependent on gp41 fusion activity as confirmed by fusion-restricted gp41 point mutants and use of the fusion inhibitor T20. Interestingly, lower levels of CCR5 were able to support virus replication in the absence of bystander apoptosis. Our findings suggest that R5 HIV-1-mediated bystander apoptosis is dependent on both CCR5 expression levels as well as fusogenic activity of the Env glycoprotein.

For viral entry, HIV-1 utilizes CD4 as receptor and one of the chemokine receptors as coreceptors, the most common ones being CXCR4 (X4) and CCR5 (R5) (1Albright A.V. Shieh J.T. Itoh T. Lee B.

The progressive increase in virulence in vivo during the late stages of disease is attributed in many cases to a coreceptor switch from CCR5 tropic to CXCR4 tropic HIV (9Camerini D. Su H.P.

Although HIV selectively infects CD4+ cells, the relatively few infected cells in vivo do not account for the extensive depletion of CD4 cells.

There is growing interest in the role of the Envelope (Env) glycoprotein in bystander apoptosis due to the fact that it is expressed on the surface of infected cells and interacts with CD4 and a coreceptor (CXCR4/CCR5), thereby initiating apoptotic signaling in uninfected bystander T cells. However, in vitro studies show that although the binding of the Env gp120 subunit to CD4 and coreceptor are required for apoptosis induction, these interactions are not sufficient (24Scheller C. Jassoy C. Virology. 2001; 282: 48-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 25Blanco J. Jacotot E. Cabrera C. Cardona A. Clotet B. De Clercq E. Esté J.A. AIDS. 1999; 13: 909-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). In support of this observation, we and others showed that the fusion process mediated by the gp41 subunit of HIV envelope may be critical in bystander killing (26Blanco J. Barretina J. Ferri K.F.

Furthermore, through mutagenesis studies, we demonstrated that hemifusion (incomplete fusion accompanied by partial mixing of apposing cell membranes) induced by gp41 subunit is the major mechanism for HIV Env-mediated bystander T cell apoptosis (29Garg H.

The fusion of biological membranes mediated by HIV Env, specifically in the case of R5 tropic viruses, is dependent on the expression level of CCR5 coreceptor on cells. Surface CCR5 expression levels in turn are dependent on the CCR5 gene (30Wu L. Paxton W.A. Kassam N. Ruffing N. Rottman J.B. Sullivan N. Choe H. Sodroski J. Newman W. Koup R.A. Mackay C.R. J. Exp.

Virol. 1998; 72: 2855-2864Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrated that different levels of CCR5 expression in HeLa cells can affect fusion mediated by different R5 isolates. The importance of CCR5 expression levels is further emphasized by its effects (within physiological limits) on Env-mediated fusion and virus replication (32Platt E.J. Wehrly K. Kuhmann S.E. Chesebro B. Kabat D. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 2855-2864Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33Platt E.J. Durnin J.P. Kabat D. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 4347-4356Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). However, whether increased surface expression of CCR5 accounts for higher Env-mediated fusion and apoptosis in certain R5 virus-infected patients remains to be determined. Previous studies observed that CCR5Δ32 heterozygous (CCR5Δ32+/−) individuals, while susceptible to HIV infection, show a slower progression to AIDS (34Michael N.L. Chang G. Louie L.G. Mascola J.R.

Choe H. Sodroski J. Newman W. Koup R.A. Mackay C.R. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 1681-1691Crossref PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar). On the contrary, CCR5Δ32 homozygous populations resist HIV infection with R5 tropic viruses (37Liu R. Paxton W.A. Choe S. Ceradini D. Martin S.R. Horuk R. MacDonald M.E. Stuhlmann H. Koup R.A.

Similarly, SCID-hu mice reconstituted with CCR5Δ32+/− thymus grafts were resistant to CCR5 virus-mediated CD4 cell loss even in the presence of virus replication (38Scoggins R.M. Taylor Jr., J.R. Patrie J. van't Wout A.B. Schuitemaker H. Camerini D. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 3205-3216Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). These studies demonstrate the importance and complexity of CCR5 expression levels on HIV pathogenesis. In this study we asked what was the role of CCR5 cell surface expression as well as Env fusion activity on bystander apoptosis induction by HIV-1 YU-2 Env, a CCR5 isolate. We engineered SupT1 cells to express either low, medium, or high levels of CCR5 on the surface or used R5 Env mutants with different fusogenic activities to address these questions. We show here that R5 Env-mediated bystander apoptosis is a function of both CCR5 expression levels and Env fusogenic activity. However, this bystander apoptosis induction is independent of virus replication, supporting the idea that individuals with lower levels of CCR5, as in the case of CCR5Δ32+/−, may be able to support virus replication without bystander apoptosis and consequently slower progression to AIDS. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study showing that CCR5 cell surface levels determine susceptibility to bystander apoptosis by HIV-1 Env independent of virus replication. SupT1 cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 media supplemented with 10% FBS and penicillin/streptomycin (5000 units/ml). HeLa and TZM cells (National Institutes of Health AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagles medium supplemented with 10% FBS and penicillin/streptomycin (5000 units/ml). Fusion inhibitor T20 (Enfuvirtide) was provided by National Institutes of Health AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program. Pan caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-fmk and mitochondrial potential sensor dye DiOC6 were obtained from Calbiochem. Molecular clones of HIV-1 YU-2 and NL4-3 and Env clone QH0692.42 (39Li M. Gao F. Mascola J.R. Stamatatos L. Polonis V.R. Koutsoukos M. Voss G. Goepfert P. Gilbert P. Greene K.M. Bilska M. Kothe D.L. Salazar-Gonzalez J.F. Wei X. Decker J.M. Hahn B.H. Montefiori D.C. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 10108-10125Crossref PubMed Scopus (944) Google Scholar) were obtained from the National Institutes of Health AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program. EcoRI-XhoI fragments from the YU-2 molecular clone were cloned into pcDNA 3.1 expression vector (Invitrogen) making the wild type (WT) YU-2 Env construct. The fragment contains open reading frames of env, tat, and rev genes. Point mutations were introduced into the WT Env construct using QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The mutants were numbered based on Env sequence of HXB-2 reference strain. All mutant and WT YU-2 Env regions were also introduced into the NL4-3 molecular clone using the EcoRI-XhoI fragments to generate infectious molecular clones containing YU-2 env and henceforth referred to as NL-YU-2. HeLa cells were transfected in 6-well plates with the HIV-1 Env vectors using ExGen 500 (Fermentas Life Science) transfection reagent as per the manufacturer's instructions. 24 h post-transfection, the cells were collected and used for either cell to cell fusion assay or bystander apoptosis induction in coculture experiments with target cells. For the generation of cell lines expressing different levels of CCR5, first a lentiviral vector was generated. CCR5 gene was amplified from plasmid pSFF-CCR5 a kind gift from Dr. David Kabat (32Platt E.J. Wehrly K. Kuhmann S.E. Chesebro B. Kabat D. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 2855-2864Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The PCR-amplified region was cloned into pLENTi 6.3 vector (Invitrogen) using a TOPO cloning approach to generate pLenti-CCR5. The insert was sequenced for confirmation. Lentiviral particles were generated in 293T cells by transfecting with pLenti-CCR5 in combination with the helper construct and VSVG as per the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). The lentivirus particles were used for transduction of SupT1 cells followed by two-step flow cytometric sorting using FACS ARIA II system (BD Biosciences). Individual clones were selected and expanded in blasticidin media and characterized for CD4 as well as CCR5 expression. The resulting CCR5-expressing cell lines referred to as SupT-R5 clones, H6 (high CCR5), M10 (medium CCR5), and L23 (low CCR5) were selected for further analysis and used in all subsequent experiments. For induction of apoptosis, coculture between Env-transfected HeLa cells and SupT-R5 cell lines was performed. HeLa cells transfected with either WT or mutant Env constructs were seeded in 24-well plates at 105 cells/well. The cells were allowed to adhere for 4–6 h. Subsequently, the media was removed, and SupT-R5 cells at 0.5–1 × 106 cells were added. Different inhibitors were added at the time of coculture. The cells were cocultured for 24 h following which the suspension cells were collected, stained with annexin V (BD Biosciences), and analyzed by flow cytometry using a FACS CANTO-II (BD Biosciences). For some assays, apoptosis was detected by staining with mitochondrial potential sensitive dye DiOC6 (10 μm) (Calbiochem) followed by flow cytometry. At least 10,000 events were collected and analyzed using FACS DIVA (BD Biosciences) or Tree Star FlowJo software. Env-transfected HeLa cells were labeled with either cytoplasmic dye CMTMR (10 μm) or lipophilic membrane dye DiI (Vybrant cell labeling kit, Molecular Probes). The cells were washed and plated in 24-well plates at 105 cells/well. After 4–6 h, unlabeled SupT-R5 cells (H6, M10, or L23) were added at 5 × 105 cells/well and cocultured for 24 h. Subsequently, the nonadherent target cells were collected and stained with annexin V for detection of apoptosis and analyzed by flow cytometry. Transfer of dye (cytoplasmic or membrane) was acquired in the red channel (FL-2), and the green channel (FL1) was used for apoptosis detection via annexin V FITC. This assay determined whether the apoptotic target cells seen in our system had taken up cytoplasmic or membrane dyes from the effector cells. SupT-R5 cell lines (H6, M10, and L23) were infected with equal reverse transcriptase (RT) activity units of NL-YU-2 virus and cultured for indicated times. The cultures were split 1:3 every 2nd or 3rd day, and culture supernatants were harvested for determination of RT activity. Cells were collected at day 7 post-infection, fixed, permeabilized, and stained with anti-p24 RD-1 antibody clone KC57 (Beckman Coulter) for detection of virus infection and with activated caspase indicator, Z-VAD-FITC (Promega), for apoptosis. Flow cytometry was performed on the samples using a FACS CANTO-II flow cytometer. Data were analyzed using FACS DIVA software with at least 20,000 events acquired for each sample. At day 3, 5, 7, and 10 post-infection, cells were also assayed for viability using the Cell Titer Glo (Promega) viability assay that is based on measuring cellular ATP levels. Supernatants from the cultures were collected at different time points and assayed for virus replication using RT assay as described previously (40Joshi A. Nagashima K. Freed E.O. J. Virol. 2006; 80: 7939-7951Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). HeLa cells transfected with different YU-2 Env expression vectors (which also express HIV-1 Tat) were seeded in 96-well plates at 2 × 104 cells/well. TZM cells expressing CD4 and CXCR4 as well as Tat-dependent luciferase reporter gene were added at the same concentration. The cells were cocultured for 6 h following which the luciferase activity was measured by BriteLite luciferase substrate (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). For fusion with SupT-R5 cell lines, a dye transfer assay was performed as described by Gallo et al. (41Gallo S.A. Reeves J.D. Garg H. Foley B. Doms R.W. Blumenthal R. Retrovirology. 2006; 3: 90Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Briefly, HeLa cells transfected with YU-2 Env WT were labeled with a red fluorescent dye, CMTMR (10 μm). SupT-R5 cell lines were labeled with a green fluorescent dye, CMFDA (10 μm). The two cell lines were mixed, and fusion was detected by fluorescent microscopy 24 h post coculture using a Nikon Ti Eclipse microscope. Fusion was calculated as percent of area double-positive for red and green dye versus total red area using NIS Elements software (Nikon). The surface levels of CCR5 vary considerably among the human population because of polymorphisms both in the CCR5 gene (42de Roda Husman A.M. Koot M. Cornelissen M. Keet I.P. Brouwer M. Broersen S.M.

Lancet. 1998; 352: 866-870Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). This differential surface expression of CCR5 has been correlated with progression to AIDS in HIV-infected individuals (14Ostrowski M.A. Justement S.J. Catanzaro A. Hallahan C.A. Ehler L.A.

Lederman M.M. Clin. Immunol. 2003; 108: 234-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), although the mechanism behind this phenomenon remains undetermined. To better understand the correlation between cell surface CCR5 levels and AIDS pathogenesis, we established CD4+ T cell lines that express different levels of CCR5. SupT1 cells that naturally lack CCR5 expression were transduced with a lentiviral vector expressing CCR5. Single clones were sorted by flow cytometry and selected using blasticidin resistance. After initial characterization of clones for CD4 and CCR5 levels, three cell lines representing low (L23), medium (M10), and high (H6) CCR5 expression were selected for further studies based on stable CD4 and CCR5 expression levels. As seen in Fig. 1A, the expression of CD4 in all the cell lines was comparable. However, the cell lines showed progressively higher CCR5 expression levels (Fig. 1B) starting with L23 followed by M10 and the highest expressing H6 cell lines based on mean fluorescent intensity of CCR5 staining. The expression of CD4 and CCR5 was stable in the cell lines over several weeks of culture in the presence of blasticidin. This is depicted in Fig. 1, A, right panels, and B, where mean fluorescent intensity of CD4 and CCR5 surface staining is from three independent time points in culture. HIV envelope-mediated apoptosis of uninfected bystander T cells is one of the mechanisms of CD4 T cell depletion during progression to AIDS (44Garg H. Blumenthal R. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2008; 65: 3134-3144Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). We previously showed that an X4 tropic isolate of HIV causes bystander T cell apoptosis via gp41-mediated fusion/hemifusion (27Garg H. Blumenthal R. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2006; 79: 351-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 29Garg H. Joshi A. Freed E.O. Blumenthal R. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 16899-16906Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In this study, we asked whether this was true for an R5 tropic HIV envelope and if bystander apoptosis mediated by an R5 HIV envelope correlated with surface CCR5 expression levels. We used a coculture assay whereby HeLa cells transfected with a R5 Env expression vector (YU-2 Env) were cocultured with SupT-R5 cell lines H6, M10, or L23. Apoptosis was determined 24 h post coculture using annexin V staining as a marker of apoptosis. As seen in Fig. 2A, apoptosis induction was highest for H6 (high CCR5 expressing) cell line followed by M10 (medium CCR5) and L23 (low CCR5 expression). Env-specific apoptosis was calculated for each cell line by subtracting corresponding background apoptosis derived using control vector-transfected cells (Fig. 2B). We further confirmed the differential induction of bystander apoptosis in the cell lines by determining caspase 3 activity in the cocultures (Fig. 2C). This was proportional to the amount of Env-specific apoptosis in corresponding cultures. That this differential bystander apoptosis was not specific for YU-2 Env was confirmed by using an R5 tropic primary Env clone QH0692.42 (39Li M. Gao F. Mascola J.R. Stamatatos L. Polonis V.R.

Hence, there was a good correlation between CCR5 expression and bystander apoptosis induction suggesting that the bystander apoptosis induction capacity of R5 HIV Env is dependent on the level of CCR5 cell surface expression. Given that Env glycoprotein-mediated fusion depends on CCR5 levels (32Platt E.J. Wehrly K. Kuhmann S.E. Chesebro B. Kabat D. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 2855-2864Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and that such resultant cell-cell fusion determines bystander apoptosis induction (27Garg H. Blumenthal R. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2006; 79: 351-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), we wanted to determine whether CCR5 expression levels affected cell to cell fusion capacity in our cell lines. We conducted a coculture assay similar to the one used for apoptosis induction described above. However, in this case the effector (HeLa-expressing Env) and the target (H6, M10, or L23) cells were labeled with a green (CMFDA) and red (CMTMR) fluorescent dye, respectively. As seen in Fig. 3A, the high CCR5-expressing H6 cell line underwent extensive fusion with effector cells showing numerous large syncytia (white arrows) followed by the medium CCR5-expressing cell line, M10, whereas only limited and small syncytia were seen with the low CCR5-expressing L23 cell line. Quantitation of fusion for each cell line shows clear differences in the level of fusion with the highest fusion with H6 followed by M10 and L23 (Fig. 3B). This suggests that the cell lines undergo differential cell to cell fusion mediated by HIV Env glycoprotein that correlates with CCR5 expression levels. These data also support the correlation between cell to cell fusion and bystander apoptosis induction by R5 tropic HIV Env. Although the levels of CCR5 vary considerably in HIV-infected individuals, which in many cases correlates with differences in disease progression (45Shieh B. Liau Y.E. Hsieh P.S. Yan Y.P. Wang S.T. Li C. Int. Immunol. 2000; 12: 1311-1318Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), there seems to be a relatively smaller effect of cellular CCR5 expression levels on susceptibility to viral infection and/or viremia (46Hunt P.W. Carrington M. Curr. Opin HIV AIDS. 2008; 3: 342-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Hence, we asked whether the cell lines expressing lower levels of CCR5 could support HIV-1 replication and whether this infection was associated with bystander apoptosis. We infected the SupT-R5 clones H6, M10, and L23 with NL-YU-2 virus that contains the R5 Env region of YU-2 in the NL4-3 backbone, and we monitored the cultures for virus replication and bystander apoptosis induction over a period of several days. The number of infected cells was determined by staining for intracellular HIV-1 Gag p24 antigen using specific antibody, whereas apoptosis was measured via caspase activation using Z-VAD-FITC. As seen in Fig. 4A, at day 7 post-infection p24+ cells were seen in all three cell lines infected with NL-YU-2 virus. Interestingly, apoptosis was largely restricted to the H6 cell line that expresses the highest levels of CCR5. In essence, the number of p24-positive cells in H6 and M10 cell lines was similar (Fig. 4B); however, there was a marked absence of apoptotic cells in M10-infected cultures (Fig. 4C). Moreover, in the infected H6 cell line, the caspase-positive cells were largely p24-negative suggesting that these were uninfected cells that were probably in contact with infected cells and undergoing bystander apoptosis consistent with our previous findings (47Garg H. Joshi A. Ye C. Shankar P. Manjunath N. Virol. J. 2011; 8: 34Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) and those by Holm et al. (48Holm G.H. Zhang C. Gorry P.R. Peden K. Schols D. De Clercq E. Gabuzda D. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 4541-4551Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). We also observed that cell to cell fusion leading to syncytia formation was largely restricted to H6 cells (Fig. 4, F and G) at the peak of virus replication at day 7 (Fig. 4E). The lack of apoptosis in the M10 and L23 cell lines was further supported by the loss of viabili"
https://openalex.org/W2017290031,"Mannosylated molecules on the Mycobacterium tuberculosis surface are important determinants in the immunopathogenesis of tuberculosis. To date, much attention has been paid to mannose-capped lipoarabinomannan, which mediates phagocytosis and intracellular trafficking of M. tuberculosis by engaging the macrophage mannose receptor and subsequently binds to intracellular CD1b molecules for presentation to T cells. Another important mannosylated lipoglycan on the M. tuberculosis surface is lipomannan (LM). Comparative structural detail of the LMs from virulent and avirulent strains is limited as is knowledge regarding their differential capacity to be recognized by the adaptive immune response. Here, we purified LM from the avirulent M. smegmatis and the virulent M. tuberculosis H(37)R(v), performed a comparative structural biochemical analysis, and addressed their ability to stimulate CD1b-restricted T cell clones. We found that M. tuberculosis H(37)R(v) produces a large neutral LM (TB-LM); in contrast, M. smegmatis produces a smaller linear acidic LM (SmegLM) with a high succinate content. Correspondingly, TB-LM was not as efficiently presented to CD1b-restricted T cells as SmegLM. Thus, here we correlate the structure-function relationships for LMs with CD1b-restricted T cell responses and provide evidence that the structural features of TB-LM contribute to its diminished T cell responsiveness."
https://openalex.org/W2043521797,"Background Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) is one of the enzymes involved in homocysteine metabolism. Despite considerable genetic and clinical attention, the reaction mechanism and regulation of this enzyme are not fully understood because of difficult production and poor stability. While recombinant enzymes from thermophilic organisms are often stable and easy to prepare, properties of thermostable MTHFRs have not yet been reported. Methodology/Principal Findings MTHFR from Thermus thermophilus HB8, a homologue of Escherichia coli MetF, has been expressed in E. coli and purified. The purified MTHFR was chiefly obtained as a heterodimer of apo- and holo-subunits, that is, one flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) prosthetic group bound per dimer. The crystal structure of the holo-subunit was quite similar to the β8α8 barrel of E. coli MTHFR, while that of the apo-subunit was a previously unobserved closed form. In addition, the intersubunit interface of the dimer in the crystals was different from any of the subunit interfaces of the tetramer of E. coli MTHFR. Free FAD could be incorporated into the apo-subunit of the purified Thermus enzyme after purification, forming a homodimer of holo-subunits. Comparison of the crystal structures of the heterodimer and the homodimer revealed different intersubunit interfaces, indicating a large conformational change upon FAD binding. Most of the biochemical properties of the heterodimer and the homodimer were the same, except that the homodimer showed ≈50% activity per FAD-bound subunit in folate-dependent reactions. Conclusions/Significance The different intersubunit interfaces and rearrangement of subunits of Thermus MTHFR may be related to human enzyme properties, such as the allosteric regulation by S-adenosylmethionine and the enhanced instability of the Ala222Val mutant upon loss of FAD. Whereas E. coli MTHFR was the only structural model for human MTHFR to date, our findings suggest that Thermus MTHFR will be another useful model for this important enzyme."

In this study, we have produced and assayed murine polyomavirus (MPyV) VLPs carrying the entire human Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) (PSA-MPyVLPs) for their potential use for immune therapy in a mouse model system. BALB/c mice immunized with PSA-MPyVLPs were only marginally protected against outgrowth of a PSA-expressing tumor. To improve protection, PSA-MPyVLPs were co-injected with adjuvant CpG, either alone or loaded onto murine dendritic cells (DCs). Immunization with PSA-MPyVLPs loaded onto DCs in the presence of CpG was shown to efficiently protect mice from tumor outgrowth. In addition, cellular and humoral immune responses after immunization were examined. PSA-specific CD4+ and CD8+ cells were demonstrated, but no PSA-specific IgG antibodies. Vaccination with DCs loaded with PSA-MPyVLPs induced an eight-fold lower titre of anti-VLP antibodies than vaccination with PSA-MPyVLPs alone. In conclusion, immunization of BALB/c mice with PSA-MPyVLPs, loaded onto DCs and co-injected with CpG, induces an efficient PSA-specific tumor protective immune response, including both CD4+ and CD8+ cells with a low induction of anti-VLP antibodies."
https://openalex.org/W2040058379,"Plant litter decomposition is a critical ecosystem process representing a major pathway for carbon flux, but little is known about how it is affected by changes in plant composition and diversity. Single plant functional groups (graminoids, legumes, non-leguminous forbs) were removed from a grassland in northern Canada to examine the impacts of functional group identity on decomposition. Removals were conducted within two different environmental contexts (fertilization and fungicide application) to examine the context-dependency of these identity effects. We examined two different mechanisms by which the loss of plant functional groups may impact decomposition: effects of the living plant community on the decomposition microenvironment, and changes in the species composition of the decomposing litter, as well as the interaction between these mechanisms. We show that the identity of the plant functional group removed affects decomposition through both mechanisms. Removal of both graminoids and forbs slowed decomposition through changes in the decomposition microenvironment. We found non-additive effects of litter mixing, with both the direction and identity of the functional group responsible depending on year; in 2004 graminoids positively influenced decomposition whereas in 2006 forbs negatively influenced decomposition rate. Although these two mechanisms act independently, their effects may be additive if both mechanisms are considered simultaneously. It is essential to understand the variety of mechanisms through which even a single ecosystem property is affected if we are to predict the future consequences of biodiversity loss."

The fertilized eggs switch off this time bomb whereas aged unfertilized eggs and parthenogenetically activated eggs fail to stop the timer and die. To investigate the nature of the molecular clock that triggers the egg decision of committing suicide, we introduce here Xenopus eggs as an in vivo system for studying the death of unfertilized eggs. We report that after ovulation, a number of eggs remains in the female body where they die by apoptosis. Similarly, ovulated unfertilized eggs recovered in the external medium die within 72 h. We showed that the death process depends on both cytochrome c release and caspase activation. The apoptotic machinery is turned on during meiotic maturation, before fertilization. The death pathway is independent of ERK but relies on activating Bad phosphorylation through the control of both kinases Cdk1 and JNK. In conclusion, the default fate of an unfertilized Xenopus egg is to die by a mitochondrial dependent apoptosis activated during meiotic maturation."
https://openalex.org/W1998537378,"GPR50 is an orphan G-protein coupled receptor most closely related to the melatonin receptors. The physiological function of GPR50 remains unclear, although our previous studies implicate the receptor in energy homeostasis. Here, we reveal a role for GPR50 as a signalling partner and modulator of the transcriptional co-activator TIP60. This interaction was identified in a yeast-two-hybrid screen, and confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation and co-localisation of TIP60 and GPR50 in HEK293 cells. Co-expression with TIP60 increased perinuclear localisation of full length GPR50, and resulted in nuclear translocation of the cytoplasmic tail of the receptor, suggesting a functional interaction of the two proteins. We further demonstrate that GPR50 can enhance TIP60-coactiavtion of glucocorticoid receptor (GR) signalling. In line with in vitro results, repression of pituitary Pomc expression, and induction of gluconeogenic genes in liver in response to the GR agonist, dexamethasone was attenuated in Gpr50(-/-) mice. These results identify a novel role for GPR50 in glucocorticoid receptor signalling through interaction with TIP60."
https://openalex.org/W1995397433,"Understanding the circumstances under which exposure to transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs) leads to infection is important for managing risks to public health. Based upon ideas in toxicology and radiology, it is plausible that exposure to harmful agents, including TSEs, is completely safe if the dose is low enough. However, the existence of a threshold, below which infection probability is zero has never been demonstrated experimentally. Here we explore this question by combining data and mathematical models that describe scrapie infections in mice following experimental challenge over a broad range of doses. We analyse data from 4338 mice inoculated at doses ranging over ten orders of magnitude. These data are compared to results from a within-host model in which prions accumulate according to a stochastic birth-death process. Crucially, this model assumes no threshold on the dose required for infection. Our data reveal that infection is possible at the very low dose of a 1000 fold dilution of the dose that infects half the challenged animals (ID50). Furthermore, the dose response curve closely matches that predicted by the model. These findings imply that there is no safe dose of prions and that assessments of the risk from low dose exposure are right to assume a linear relationship between dose and probability of infection. We also refine two common perceptions about TSE incubation periods: that their mean values decrease linearly with logarithmic decreases in dose and that they are highly reproducible between hosts. The model and data both show that the linear decrease in incubation period holds only for doses above the ID50. Furthermore, variability in incubation periods is greater than predicted by the model, not smaller. This result poses new questions about the sources of variability in prion incubation periods. It also provides insight into the limitations of the incubation period assay."

In contrast, gcm2 is expressed in pharyngeal pouches (a homologous site of the parathyroid), gills, and H+-ATPase–rich cells (HRCs), a subset of ionocytes on the skin surface of the teleost fish zebrafish. Ionocytes are specialized cells that are involved in osmotic homeostasis in aquatic vertebrates. Here, we showed that gcm2 is essential for the development of HRCs and Na+-Cl− co-transporter–rich cells (NCCCs), another subset of ionocytes in zebrafish. We also identified gcm2 enhancer regions that control gcm2 expression in ionocytes of zebrafish. Comparisons of the gcm2 locus with its neighboring regions revealed no conserved elements between zebrafish and tetrapods. Furthermore, We observed gcm2 expression patterns in embryos of the teleost fishes Medaka (Oryzias latipes) and fugu (Fugu niphobles), the extant primitive ray-finned fishes Polypterus (Polypterus senegalus) and sturgeon (a hybrid of Huso huso × Acipenser ruhenus), and the amphibian Xenopus (Xenopus laevis). Although gcm2-expressing cells were observed on the skin surface of Medaka and fugu, they were not found in Polypterus, sturgeon, or Xenopus. Our results suggest that an acquisition of enhancers for the expression of gcm2 contributes to a diversity of ionocytes in zebrafish during evolution."
https://openalex.org/W1978047892,"As PTTG1 (pituitary tumor transforming gene) abundance correlates with adverse outcomes in cancer treatment, we determined mechanisms underlying this observation by assessing the role of PTTG1 in regulating cell response to anti-neoplastic drugs. HCT116 cells devoid of PTTG1 (PTTG1(-/-)) exhibited enhanced drug sensitivity as assessed by measuring BrdU incorporation in vitro. Apoptosis, mitosis catastrophe or DNA damage were not detected, but features of senescence were observed using low doses of doxorubicin and TSA. The number of drug-induced PTTG1(-/-) senescent cells increased ∼4 fold as compared to WT PTTG1-replete cells (p<0.001). p21, an important regulator of cell senescence, was induced ∼3 fold in HCT116 PTTG1(-/-) cells upon doxorubicin or Trichostatin A treatment. Binding of Sp1, p53 and p300 to the p21 promoter was enhanced in PTTG1(-/-) cells after treatment, suggesting transcriptional regulation of p21. p21 knock down abrogated the observed senescent effects of these drugs, indicating that PTTG1 likely suppresses p21 to regulate drug-induced senescence. PTTG1 also regulated SW620 colon cancer cells response to doxorubicin and TSA mediated by p21. Subcutaneously xenografted PTTG1(-/-) HCT116 cells developed smaller tumors and exhibited enhanced responses to doxorubicin. PTTG1(-/-) tumor tissue derived from excised tumors exhibited increased doxorubicin-induced senescence. As senescence is a determinant of cell responses to anti-neoplastic treatments, these findings suggest PTTG1 as a tumor cell marker to predict anti-neoplastic treatment outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W2008987625,"Background The hybridization of nucleic acid targets with surface-immobilized probes is a widely used assay for the parallel detection of multiple targets in medical and biological research. Despite its widespread application, DNA microarray technology still suffers from several biases and lack of reproducibility, stemming in part from an incomplete understanding of the processes governing surface hybridization. In particular, non-random spatial variations within individual microarray hybridizations are often observed, but the mechanisms underpinning this positional bias remain incompletely explained. Methodology/Principal Findings This study identifies and rationalizes a systematic spatial bias in the intensity of surface hybridization, characterized by markedly increased signal intensity of spots located at the boundaries of the spotted areas of the microarray slide. Combining observations from a simplified single-probe block array format with predictions from a mathematical model, the mechanism responsible for this bias is found to be a position-dependent variation in lateral diffusion of target molecules. Numerical simulations reveal a strong influence of microarray well geometry on the spatial bias. Conclusions Reciprocal adjustment of the size of the microarray hybridization chamber to the area of surface-bound probes is a simple and effective measure to minimize or eliminate the diffusion-based bias, resulting in increased uniformity and accuracy of quantitative DNA microarray hybridization."
https://openalex.org/W2020196495,"Constituents of platelet membranes regulate the activity of the prothrombinase complex. We demonstrate that membranes containing phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) bind factor Va with high affinity (Kd = ∼10 nm) in the absence of phosphatidylserine (PS). These membranes support formation of a 60–70% functional prothrombinase complex at saturating factor Va concentrations. Although reduced interfacial packing does contribute to factor Va binding in the absence of PS, it does not correlate with the enhanced activity of the Xa-Va complex assembled on PE-containing membranes. Instead, specific protein-PE interactions appear to contribute to the effects of PE. In support of this, soluble C6PE binds to recombinant factor Va2 (Kd = ∼6.5 μm) and to factor Xa (Kd = ∼91 μm). C6PE and C6PS binding sites of factor Xa are specific, distinct, and linked, because binding of one lipid enhances the binding and activity effects of the other. C6PE triggers assembly (Kdapp = ∼40 nm) of a partially active prothrombinase complex between factor Xa and factor Va2, compared with Kdapp for C6PS ∼2 nm.

https://openalex.org/W1999119567,"Retinoids play an important role in skin homeostasis and when administered topically cause skin hyperplasia, abnormal epidermal differentiation and inflammation. Thyroidal status in humans also influences skin morphology and function and we have recently shown that the thyroid hormone receptors (TRs) are required for a normal proliferative response to 12-O-tetradecanolyphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) in mice.We have compared the epidermal response of mice lacking the thyroid hormone receptor binding isoforms TRα1 and TRβ to retinoids and TPA. Reduced hyperplasia and a decreased number of proliferating cells in the basal layer in response to 9-cis-RA and TPA were found in the epidermis of TR-deficient mice. Nuclear levels of proteins important for cell proliferation were altered, and expression of keratins 5 and 6 was also reduced, concomitantly with the decreased number of epidermal cell layers. In control mice the retinoid (but not TPA) induced parakeratosis and diminished expression of keratin 10 and loricrin, markers of early and terminal epidermal differentiation, respectively. This reduction was more accentuated in the TR deficient animals, whereas they did not present parakeratosis. Therefore, TRs modulate both the proliferative response to retinoids and their inhibitory effects on skin differentiation. Reduced proliferation, which was reversed upon thyroxine treatment, was also found in hypothyroid mice, demonstrating that thyroid hormone binding to TRs is required for the normal response to retinoids. In addition, the mRNA levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokines TNFα and IL-6 and the chemotactic proteins S1008A and S1008B were significantly elevated in the skin of TR knock-out mice after TPA or 9-cis-RA treatment and immune cell infiltration was also enhanced.Since retinoids are commonly used for the treatment of skin disorders, these results demonstrating that TRs regulate skin proliferation, differentiation and inflammation in response to these compounds could have not only physiological but also therapeutic implications."
https://openalex.org/W2013312636,"Patients with heterotaxy have characteristic cardiovascular malformations, abnormal arrangement of their visceral organs, and midline patterning defects that result from abnormal left-right patterning during embryogenesis. Loss of function of the transcription factor ZIC3 causes X-linked heterotaxy and isolated congenital heart malformations and represents one of the few known monogenic causes of congenital heart disease. The birth incidence of heterotaxy-spectrum malformations is significantly higher in males, but our previous work indicated that mutations within ZIC3 did not account for the male over-representation. Therefore, cross species comparative sequence alignment was used to identify a putative novel fourth exon, and the existence of a novel alternatively spliced transcript was confirmed by amplification from murine embryonic RNA and subsequent sequencing. This transcript, termed Zic3-B, encompasses exons 1, 2, and 4 whereas Zic3-A encompasses exons 1, 2, and 3. The resulting protein isoforms are 466 and 456 amino acid residues respectively, sharing the first 407 residues. Importantly, the last two amino acids in the fifth zinc finger DNA binding domain are altered in the Zic3-B isoform, indicating a potential functional difference that was further evaluated by expression, subcellular localization, and transactivation analyses. The temporo-spatial expression pattern of Zic3-B overlaps with Zic3-A in vivo, and both isoforms are localized to the nucleus in vitro. Both isoforms can transcriptionally activate a Gli binding site reporter, but only ZIC3-A synergistically activates upon co-transfection with Gli3, suggesting that the isoforms are functionally distinct. Screening 109 familial and sporadic male heterotaxy cases did not identify pathogenic mutations in the newly identified fourth exon and larger studies are necessary to establish the importance of the novel isoform in human disease."
https://openalex.org/W2081131456,"Activation of Natural Killer-like T cells (NKT) with the CD1d ligand α-GC leads to enhanced production of anthrax toxin protective Ag (PA)-neutralizing Abs, yet the underlying mechanism for this adjuvant effect is not known. In the current study we examined the role of Th1 and Th2 type responses in NKT-mediated enhancement of antibody responses to PA. First, the contribution of IL-4 and IFNγ to the production of PA-specific toxin-neutralizing Abs was examined. By immunizing C57Bl/6 controls IL-4−/− mice and IFNγ−/− mice and performing passive serum transfer experiments, it was observed that sera containing PA-specific IgG1, IgG2b and IgG2c neutralized toxin in vitro and conferred protection in vivo. Sera containing IgG2b and IgG2c neutralized toxin in vitro but were not sufficient for protection in vivo. Sera containing IgG1 and IgG2b neutralized toxin in vitro and conferred protection in vivo. IgG1 therefore emerged as a good correlate of protection. Next, C57Bl/6 mice were immunized with PA alone or PA plus a Th2-skewing α-GC derivative known as OCH. Neutralizing PA-specific IgG1 responses were modestly enhanced by OCH in C57Bl/6 mice. Conversely, IgG2b and IgG2c were considerably enhanced in PA/OCH-immunized IL-4−/− mice but did not confer protection. Finally, bone marrow chimeras were generated such that NKT cells were unable to express IL-4 or IFNγ. NKT-derived IL-4 was required for OCH-enhanced primary IgG1 responses but not recall responses. NKT-derived IL-4 and IFNγ also influenced primary and recall IgG2b and IgG2c titers. These data suggest targeted skewing of the Th2 response by α-GC derivatives can be exploited to optimize anthrax vaccination."
https://openalex.org/W2083574939,"The pulvinar nucleus of the tree shrew receives both topographic (specific) and nontopographic (diffuse) projections from superior colliculus (SC), which form distinct synaptic arrangements. We characterized the physiological properties of these synapses and describe two distinct types of excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) that correlate with structural properties of the specific and diffuse terminals. Synapses formed by specific terminals were found to be significantly longer than those formed by diffuse terminals. Stimulation of these two terminal types elicited two types of EPSPs that differed in their latency and threshold amplitudes. In addition, in response to repetitive stimulation (0.5–20 Hz) one type of EPSP displayed frequency-dependent depression whereas the amplitudes of the second type of EPSP were not changed by repetitive stimulation of up to 20Hz. To relate these features to vesicle release, we compared the synapsin content of terminals in the pulvinar nucleus and the dorsal lateral geniculate (dLGN) by combining immunohistochemical staining for synapsin I or II with staining for the type 1 or type 2 vesicular glutamate transporters (markers for corticothalamic and tectothalamic/retinogeniculate terminals, respectively). We found that retinogeniculate terminals do not contain either synapsin I or synapsin II, corticothalamic terminals in the dLGN and pulvinar contain synapsin I, but not synapsin II, whereas tectopulvinar terminals contain both synapsin I and synapsin II. Finally, both types of EPSPs showed a graded increase in amplitude with increasing stimulation intensity, suggesting convergence; this was confirmed using a combination of anterograde tract tracing and immunocytochemisty. We suggest that the convergent synaptic arrangements, as well as the unique synapsin content of tectopulvinar terminals, allow them to relay a dynamic range of visual signals from the SC."

The mechanisms directing self-renewal in BASCs are poorly understood. Methods BASCs (Sca-1+, CD34+, CD31− and, CD45−) were isolated from adult mouse lung using FACS, and their capacity for self-renewal and differentiation were demonstrated by immunostaining. A transcription factor network of 53 genes required for pluripotency in embryonic stem cells was assessed in BASCs, Kras-initiated lung tumor tissue, and lung organogenesis by real-time PCR. c-Myc was knocked down in BASCs by infection with c-Myc shRNA lentivirus. Comprehensive miRNA and mRNA profiling for BASCs was performed, and significant miRNAs and mRNAs potentially regulated by c-Myc were identified. We explored a c-Myc regulatory network in BASCs using a number of statistical and computational approaches through two different strategies; 1) c-Myc/Max binding sites within individual gene promoters, and 2) miRNA-regulated target genes. Results c-Myc expression was upregulated in BASCs and downregulated over the time course of lung organogenesis in vivo. The depletion of c-Myc in BASCs resulted in decreased proliferation and cell death. Multiple mRNAs and miRNAs were dynamically regulated in c-Myc depleted BASCs. Among a total of 250 dynamically regulated genes in c-Myc depleted BASCs, 57 genes were identified as potential targets of miRNAs through miRBase and TargetScan-based computational mapping. A further 88 genes were identified as potential downstream targets through their c-Myc binding motif. Conclusion c-Myc plays a critical role in maintaining the self-renewal capacity of lung bronchoalveolar stem cells through a combination of miRNA and transcription factor regulatory networks."
https://openalex.org/W2010561604,"Virus-host interactions are characterized by the selection of adaptive mechanisms by which to evade pathogenic and defense mechanisms, respectively. In primary T cells infected with HIV, HIV infection up-regulates TNF-related apoptosis inducing ligand (TRAIL) and death-inducing TRAIL receptors, but blockade of TRAIL:TRAIL receptor interaction does not alter HIV-induced cell death. Instead, HIV infection results in a novel splice variant that we call TRAIL-short (TRAIL-s), which antagonizes TRAIL-R2. In HIV patients, plasma TRAIL-s concentration increases with increasing viral load and renders cells resistant to TRAIL-induced death. Knockdown of TRAIL-s abrogates this resistance. We propose that TRAIL-s is a novel adaptive mechanism of apoptosis resistance acquired by HIV-infected cells to avoid their elimination by TRAIL-dependent effector mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W2009188723,"Many commonly used non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) also cause gastrointestinal toxicity, including the development of life-threatening peptic ulcers. We report that mast cell-deficient mice have an extremely high incidence of severe peptic ulceration when exposed to the NSAID piroxicam. This enhanced ulcer susceptibility can be reversed by reconstitution with mast cells. Furthermore, wild type mice treated with diphenhydramine hydrochloride, a commonly used antihistamine that blocks histamine H1 receptors, develop a similarly high incidence of peptic ulcers following piroxicam exposure. The protective effect of mast cells is independent of TNF, blockade of H2 receptors, or acid secretion. These data indicate a critical role for mast cells and the histamine that they produce in prevention and/or repair of piroxicam-induced gastric mucosal injury.

https://openalex.org/W2021599794,"HIV replication in mononuclear phagocytes is a multi-step process regulated by viral and cellular proteins with the peculiar feature of virion budding and accumulation in intra-cytoplasmic vesicles. Interaction of urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) with its cell surface receptor (uPAR) has been shown to favor virion accumulation in such sub-cellular compartment in primary monocyte-derived macrophages and chronically infected promonocytic U1 cells differentiated into macrophage-like cells by stimulation with phorbol myristate acetate (PMA). By adopting this latter model system, we have here investigated which intracellular signaling pathways were triggered by uPA/uPAR interaction leading the redirection of virion accumulation in intra-cytoplasmic vesicles.uPA induced activation of RhoA, PKCδ and PKCε in PMA-differentiated U1 cells. In the same conditions, RhoA, PKCδ and PKCε modulated uPA-induced cell adhesion and polarization, whereas only RhoA and PKCε were also responsible for the redirection of virions in intracellular vesicles. Distribution of G and F actin revealed that uPA reorganized the cytoskeleton in both adherent and polarized cells. The role of G and F actin isoforms was unveiled by the use of cytochalasin D, a cell-permeable fungal toxin that prevents F actin polymerization. Receptor-independent cytoskeleton remodeling by Cytochalasin D resulted in cell adhesion, polarization and intracellular accumulation of HIV virions similar to the effects gained with uPA.These findings illustrate the potential contribution of the uPA/uPAR system in the generation and/or maintenance of intra-cytoplasmic vesicles that actively accumulate virions, thus sustaining the presence of HIV reservoirs of macrophage origin. In addition, our observations also provide evidences that pathways controlling cytoskeleton remodeling and activation of PKCε bear relevance for the design of new antiviral strategies aimed at interfering with the partitioning of virion budding between intra-cytoplasmic vesicles and plasma membrane in infected human macrophages."
https://openalex.org/W2089344050,"The aim of this study was to determine the cytotoxic and apoptotic effects of erythrocarpine E (CEB4), a limonoid extracted from Chisocheton erythrocarpus on human oral squamous cell carcinoma. Based on preliminary dimethyl-2-thiazolyl-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assays, CEB4 treated HSC-4 cells demonstrated a cytotoxic effect and inhibited cell proliferation in a time and dose dependent manner with an IC(50) value of 4.0±1.9 µM within 24 h of treatment. CEB4 was also found to have minimal cytotoxic effects on the normal cell line, NHBE with cell viability levels maintained above 80% upon treatment. Annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC), poly-ADP ribose polymerase (PARP) cleavage and DNA fragmentation assay results showed that CEB4 induces apoptosis mediated cell death. Western blotting results demonstrated that the induction of apoptosis by CEB4 appeared to be mediated through regulation of the p53 signalling pathway as there was an increase in p53 phosphorylation levels. CEB4 was also found to up-regulate the pro-apoptotic protein, Bax, while down-regulating the anti-apoptotic protein, Bcl-2, suggesting the involvement of the intrinsic mitochondrial pathway. Reduced levels of initiator procaspase-9 and executioner caspase-3 zymogen were also observed following CEB4 exposure, hence indicating the involvement of cytochrome c mediated apoptosis. These results demonstrate the cytotoxic and apoptotic ability of erythrocarpine E, and suggest its potential development as a cancer chemopreventive agent."
https://openalex.org/W2019168977,"Preeclampsia, a pregnancy-specific syndrome characterized by hypertension, proteinuria and edema, is a major cause of fetal and maternal morbidity and mortality especially in developing countries. Bj-PRO-10c, a proline-rich peptide isolated from Bothrops jararaca venom, has been attributed with potent anti-hypertensive effects. Recently, we have shown that Bj-PRO-10c-induced anti-hypertensive actions involved NO production in spontaneous hypertensive rats. Using in vitro studies we now show that Bj-PRO-10c was able to increase NO production in human umbilical vein endothelial cells from hypertensive pregnant women (HUVEC-PE) to levels observed in HUVEC of normotensive women. Moreover, in the presence of the peptide, eNOS expression as well as argininosuccinate synthase activity, the key rate-limiting enzyme of the citrulline-NO cycle, were enhanced. In addition, excessive superoxide production due to NO deficiency, one of the major deleterious effects of the disease, was inhibited by Bj-PRO-10c. Bj-PRO-10c induced intracellular calcium fluxes in both, HUVEC-PE and HUVEC, which, however, led to activation of eNOS expression only in HUVEC-PE. Since Bj-PRO-10c promoted biological effects in HUVEC from patients suffering from the disorder and not in normotensive pregnant women, we hypothesize that Bj-PRO-10c induces its anti-hypertensive effect in mothers with preeclampsia. Such properties may initiate the development of novel therapeutics for treating preeclampsia."
https://openalex.org/W2021577270,"Fibroblast growth factor (Fgf) signalling plays a crucial role in many developmental processes. Among the Fgf pathway ligands, Fgf9 (UniProt: P54130) has been demonstrated to participate in maturation of various organs and tissues including skeleton, testes, lung, heart, and eye. Here we establish a novel Fgf9 allele, discovered in a dominant N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU) screen for eye-size abnormalities using the optical low coherence interferometry technique. The underlying mouse mutant line Aca12 was originally identified because of its significantly reduced lens thickness. Linkage studies located Aca12 to chromosome 14 within a 3.6 Mb spanning interval containing the positional candidate genes Fgf9 (MGI: 104723), Gja3 (MGI: 95714), and Ift88 (MGI: 98715). While no sequence differences were found in Gja3 and Ift88, we identified an A→G missense mutation at cDNA position 770 of the Fgf9 gene leading to an Y162C amino acid exchange. In contrast to previously described Fgf9 mutants, Fgf9(Y162C) carriers were fully viable and did not reveal reduced body-size, male-to-female sexual reversal or skeletal malformations. The histological analysis of the retina as well as its basic functional characterization by electroretinography (ERG) did not show any abnormality. However, the analysis of head-tracking response of the Fgf9(Y162C) mutants in a virtual drum indicated a gene-dosage dependent vision loss of almost 50%. The smaller lenses in Fgf9(Y162C) suggested a role of Fgf9 during lens development. Histological investigations showed that lens growth retardation starts during embryogenesis and continues after birth. Young Fgf9(Y162C) lenses remained transparent but developed age-related cataracts. Taken together, Fgf9(Y162C) is a novel neomorphic allele that initiates microphakia and reduced vision without effects on organs and tissues outside the eye. Our data point to a role of Fgf9 signalling in primary and secondary lens fiber cell growth. The results underline the importance of allelic series to fully understand multiple functions of a gene."
https://openalex.org/W1978840429,"Sulfolobus islandicus rod shaped virus 2 (SIRV2) infects the archaeon Sulfolobus islandicus at extreme temperature (70°C–80°C) and acidity (pH 3). SIRV2 encodes a Holliday junction resolving enzyme (SIRV2 Hjr) that has been proposed as a key enzyme in SIRV2 genome replication. The molecular mechanism for SIRV2 Hjr four-way junction cleavage bias, minimal requirements for four-way junction cleavage, and substrate specificity were determined. SIRV2 Hjr cleaves four-way DNA junctions with a preference for cleavage of exchange strand pairs, in contrast to host-derived resolving enzymes, suggesting fundamental differences in substrate recognition and cleavage among closely related Sulfolobus resolving enzymes. Unlike other viral resolving enzymes, such as T4 endonuclease VII or T7 endonuclease I, that cleave branched DNA replication intermediates, SIRV2 Hjr cleavage is specific to four-way DNA junctions and inactive on other branched DNA molecules. In addition, a specific interaction was detected between SIRV2 Hjr and the SIRV2 virion body coat protein (SIRV2gp26). Based on this observation, a model is proposed linking SIRV2 Hjr genome resolution to viral particle assembly."
https://openalex.org/W2063534173,"The ability to generate whole genome data is rapidly becoming commoditized. For example, a mammalian sized genome (∼3Gb) can now be sequenced using approximately ten lanes on an Illumina HiSeq 2000. Since lanes from different runs are often combined, verifying that each lane in a genome's build is from the same sample is an important quality control. We sought to address this issue in a post hoc bioinformatic manner, instead of using upstream sample or “barcode” modifications. We rely on the inherent small differences between any two individuals to show that genotype concordance rates can be effectively used to test if any two lanes of HiSeq 2000 data are from the same sample. As proof of principle, we use recent data from three different human samples generated on this platform. We show that the distributions of concordance rates are non-overlapping when comparing lanes from the same sample versus lanes from different samples. Our method proves to be robust even when different numbers of reads are analyzed. Finally, we provide a straightforward method for determining the gender of any given sample. Our results suggest that examining the concordance of detected genotypes from lanes purported to be from the same sample is a relatively simple approach for confirming that combined lanes of data are of the same identity and quality."
https://openalex.org/W2027119827,"Hepatitis C Virus E1E2 heterodimers are components of the viral spike. Although there is a general agreement on the necessity of the co-expression of both E1 and E2 on a single coding unit for their productive folding and assembly, in a previous study using an in vitro system we obtained strong indications that E1 can achieve folding in absence of E2. Here, we have studied the folding pathway of unescorted E1 from stably expressing CHO cells, compared to the folding observed in presence of the E2 protein. A DTT-resistant conformation is achieved by E1 in both situations, consistent with the presence of an E2-independent oxidative pathway. However, while the E1E2 heterodimer is stable inside cells, E1 expressed alone is degraded within a few hours. On the other hand, the oxidation and stability of individually expressed E2 subunits is dependent on E1 co-expression. These data are consistent with E1 and E2 assisting each other for correct folding via different mechanisms: E2 assists E1 by stabilizing a semi-native conformation meanwhile E1 drives E2 towards a productive folding pathway."
https://openalex.org/W1997180478,"Gene expression during lytic development of bacteriophage Mu occurs in three phases: early, middle, and late. Transcription from the middle promoter, P(m), requires the phage-encoded activator protein Mor and the bacterial RNA polymerase. The middle promoter has a -10 hexamer, but no -35 hexamer. Instead P(m) has a hyphenated inverted repeat that serves as the Mor binding site overlapping the position of the missing -35 element. Mor binds to this site as a dimer and activates transcription by recruiting RNA polymerase. The crystal structure of the His-Mor dimer revealed three structural elements: an N-terminal dimerization domain, a C-terminal helix-turn-helix DNA-binding domain, and a β-strand linker between the two domains. We predicted that the highly conserved residues in and flanking the β-strand would be essential for the conformational flexibility and DNA minor groove binding by Mor. To test this hypothesis, we carried out single codon-specific mutagenesis with degenerate oligonucleotides. The amino acid substitutions were identified by DNA sequencing. The mutant proteins were characterized for their overexpression, solubility, DNA binding, and transcription activation. This analysis revealed that the Gly-Gly motif formed by Gly-65 and Gly-66 and the β-strand side chain of Tyr-70 are crucial for DNA binding by His-tagged Mor. Mutant proteins with substitutions at Gly-74 retained partial activity. Treatment with the minor groove- and GC-specific chemical chromomycin A(3) demonstrated that chromomycin prevented His-Mor binding but could not disrupt a pre-formed His-Mor·DNA complex, consistent with the prediction that Mor interacts with the minor groove of the GC-rich spacer in the Mor binding site."
https://openalex.org/W2004863733,"To investigate the use of dopaminergic and serotonergic drugs in elderly people.We analyzed data on age, sex and dispensed drugs for individuals aged ≥65 years registered in the Swedish Prescribed Drug Register from July to September 2008 (n = 1,347,564; 81% of the total population aged ≥65 years in Sweden). Main outcome measures were dopaminergic (enhancing and/or lowering) and serotonergic (enhancing and/or lowering) drugs and combinations of these.Dopaminergic and serotonergic drugs were used by 5.6% and 13.2% the participants, respectively. Female gender was related to use of both dopaminergic and, particularly, serotonergic drugs. Higher age was associated with use of dopamine lowering drugs and serotonergic drugs, whereas the association with use of dopamine enhancing drugs declined in the oldest old. The occurrence of combinations of dopaminergic and serotonergic drugs was generally low, with dopamine lowering + serotonin lowering drug the most common combination (1.6%). Female gender was associated with all of the combinations of dopaminergic and serotonergic drugs, whereas age showed a mixed pattern.Approximately one out of ten older patients uses serotonergic drugs and one out of twenty dopaminergic drugs. The frequent use of dopaminergic and serotonergic drugs in the elderly patients is a potential problem due to the fact that aging is associated with a down-regulation of both these monoaminergic systems. Future studies are needed for evaluation of the impact of these drugs on different cognitive and emotional functions in old age."
