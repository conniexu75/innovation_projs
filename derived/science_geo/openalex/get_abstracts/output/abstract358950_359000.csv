Data presented in this paper indicate that dimethylthetin, (CH3)2+SCH2COO-, which has been shown by Welch (2) to be lipotropic and has been reported by du Vigneaud (3) to promote growth on a methionine-free, homocysteine-containing diet, is 20 times as active as betaine in methionine formation. Dimethyl-β-propiothetin, (CH3)2+S(CH2)2COO-, recently isolated from Polysiphonia fastigiata by Challenger and Simpson (4) is also highly active. The enzyme for this transmethylation is found in the liver and kidney of all animals tested. Its high activity and general distribution suggest its biological importance in methionine synthesis."

https://openalex.org/W2002296977,"THE twenty-fifth annual report of the British Empire Cancer Campaign covers the Work done during the latter half of 1947. To those not acquainted with the ramifications of modern cancer research, much of the work in the report will occasion surprise, owing to its apparent lack of connexion with the subject. But the fact is that the problem of malignant growth is inextricably bound up with peculiarities of cellular respiration, nutritional requirements, hormone balance and interaction of enzyme systems ; and its study demands contributions from almost every branch of science."
