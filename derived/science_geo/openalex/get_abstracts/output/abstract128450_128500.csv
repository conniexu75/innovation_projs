https://openalex.org/W1985474993,"The cause of neurodegeneration in Huntington's disease (HD) is unknown. Patients with HD have an expanded NH 2 -terminal polyglutamine region in huntingtin. An NH 2 -terminal fragment of mutant huntingtin was localized to neuronal intranuclear inclusions (NIIs) and dystrophic neurites (DNs) in the HD cortex and striatum, which are affected in HD, and polyglutamine length influenced the extent of huntingtin accumulation in these structures. Ubiquitin was also found in NIIs and DNs, which suggests that abnormal huntingtin is targeted for proteolysis but is resistant to removal. The aggregation of mutant huntingtin may be part of the pathogenic mechanism in HD."

https://openalex.org/W1999340863,"Candida albicans and Saccharomyces cerevisiae switch from a yeast to a filamentous form. In Saccharomyces, this switch is controlled by two regulatory proteins, Ste12p and Phd1p. Single-mutant strains, ste12/ste12 or phd1/phd1, are partially defective, whereas the ste12/ste12 phd1/phd1 double mutant is completely defective in filamentous growth and is noninvasive. The equivalent cph1/cph1 efg1/efg1 double mutant in Candida (Cph1p is the Ste12p homolog and Efg1p is the Phd1p homolog) is also defective in filamentous growth, unable to form hyphae or pseudohyphae in response to many stimuli, including serum or macrophages. This Candida cph1/cph1 efg1/efg1 double mutant, locked in the yeast form, is avirulent in a mouse model."

Despite their importance, nothing is known of the mechanism of action of these steroid hormones. We describe the identification of 18 Arabidopsis dwarf mutants that are unable to respond to exogenously added brassinosteroid, a phenotype that might be expected for brassinosteroid signaling mutants. All 18 mutations define alleles of a single previously described gene, BRI1. We cloned BRI1 and examined its expression pattern. It encodes a ubiquitously expressed putative receptor kinase. The extracellular domain contains 25 tandem leucine-rich repeats that resemble repeats found in animal hormone receptors, plant disease resistance genes, and genes involved in unknown signaling pathways controlling plant development."
https://openalex.org/W2099969611,"To determine which proteinases are responsible for the lung destruction characteristic of pulmonary emphysema, macrophage elastase–deficient (MME −/− ) mice were subjected to cigarette smoke. In contrast to wild-type mice, MME − / − mice did not have increased numbers of macrophages in their lungs and did not develop emphysema in response to long-term exposure to cigarette smoke. Smoke-exposed MME − / − mice that received monthly intratracheal instillations of monocyte chemoattractant protein–1 showed accumulation of alveolar macrophages but did not develop air space enlargement. Thus, macrophage elastase is probably sufficient for the development of emphysema that results from chronic inhalation of cigarette smoke."

Close to this critical point, the free-energy barrier for crystal nucleation is strongly reduced and hence, the crystal nucleation rate increases by many orders of magnitude. Because the location of the metastable critical point can be controlled by changing the composition of the solvent, the present work suggests a systematic approach to promote protein crystallization."
https://openalex.org/W2067714902,"There is growing evidence that T helper cell subsets (T H 1 and T H 2) can be differentially recruited to promote different types of inflammatory reactions. Murine T H 1 but not T H 2 cells are recruited through P- and E-selectin into inflamed tissues, where they induce delayed-type hypersensitivity reactions. The human eotaxin-receptor CCR3, originally described on eosinophils and basophils, was also found to be expressed by T H 2 cells. An antibody to CCR3 was used to isolate T cells from peripheral blood that give rise to T H 2-polarized cell lines and to identify T H 2 cells derived from naı̈ve T cells in vitro. Eotaxin stimulated increases in intracellular calcium and chemotaxis of CCR3 + T cells. The attraction of T H 2 cells by eotaxin could represent a key mechanism in allergic reactions, because it promotes the allergen-driven production of interleukin-4 and interleukin-5 necessary to activate basophils and eosinophils."
https://openalex.org/W2055171335,"DNA–(cytosine-5) methyltransferase (MCMT) methylates newly replicated mammalian DNA, but the factors regulating this activity are unknown. Here, MCMT is shown to bind proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), an auxiliary factor for DNA replication and repair. Binding of PCNA requires amino acids 163 to 174 of MCMT, occurs in intact cells at foci of newly replicated DNA, and does not alter MCMT activity. A peptide derived from the cell cycle regulator p21 WAF1 can disrupt the MCMT-PCNA interaction, which suggests that p21 WAF1 may regulate methylation by blocking access of MCMT to PCNA. MCMT and p21 WAF1 may be linked in a regulatory pathway, because the extents of their expression are inversely related in both SV40-transformed and nontransformed cells."

A suspension of ensheathing cells cultured from adult rat olfactory bulb was injected into the lesion site. This induced unbranched, elongative growth of the cut corticospinal axons. The axons grew through the transplant and continued to regenerate into the denervated caudal host tract. Rats with complete transections and no transplanted cells did not use the forepaw on the lesioned side for directed reaching. Rats in which the transplanted cells had formed a continuous bridge across the lesion exhibited directed forepaw reaching on the lesioned side."

https://openalex.org/W2083385526,"Mitochondrial uncoupling proteins (UCPs) are transporters that are important for thermogenesis. The net result of their activity is the exothermic movement of protons through the inner mitochondrial membrane, uncoupled from ATP synthesis. We have cloned a third member of the UCP family, UCP3. UCP3 is expressed at high levels in muscle and rodent brown adipose tissue. Overexpression in yeast reduced the mitochondrial membrane potential, showing that UCP3 is a functional uncoupling protein. UCP3 RNA levels are regulated by hormonal and dietary manipulations. In contrast, levels of UCP2, a widely expressed UCP family member, showed little hormonal regulation. In particular, muscle UCP3 levels were decreased 3-fold in hypothyroid rats and increased 6-fold in hyperthyroid rats. Thus UCP3 is a strong candidate to explain the effects of thyroid hormone on thermogenesis. White adipose UCP3 levels were greatly increased by treatment with the β3-adrenergic agonist, CL214613, suggesting another pathway for increasing thermogenesis. UCP3 mRNA levels were also regulated by dexamethasone, leptin, and starvation, albeit differently in muscle and brown adipose tissue. Starvation caused increased muscle and decreased BAT UCP3, suggesting that muscle assumes a larger role in thermoregulation during starvation. The UCP3 gene is located close to that encoding UCP2, in a chromosomal region implicated in previous linkage studies as contributing to obesity."

https://openalex.org/W2171498110,"A selection strategy was devised to identify bacterial genes preferentially expressed when a bacterium associates with its host cell. Fourteen Salmonella typhimurium genes, which were under the control of at least four independent regulatory circuits, were identified to be selectively induced in host macrophages. Four genes encode virulence factors, including a component of a type III secretory apparatus. This selection methodology should be generally applicable to the identification of genes from pathogenic organisms that are induced upon association with host cells or tissues."
https://openalex.org/W2082579379,"In plants and algae, photosystem II uses light energy to oxidize water to oxygen at a metalloradical site that comprises a tetranuclear manganese cluster and a tyrosyl radical. A model is proposed whereby the tyrosyl radical functions by abstracting hydrogen atoms from substrate water bound as terminal ligands to two of the four manganese ions. Molecular oxygen is produced in the final step in which hydrogen atom transfer and oxygen-oxygen bond formation occur together in a concerted reaction. This mechanism establishes clear analogies between photosynthetic water oxidation and amino acid radical function in other enzymatic reactions."

Ceramide is believed to actvia activation of protein phosphatase, proline-directed protein kinase, or protein kinase C. Tumor necrosis factor α-induced common pathway of apoptosis is associated with an early impairment of mitochondria. Herein, we demonstrate that ceramide can directly inhibit mitochondrial respiratory chain function. In isolated mitochondria, a rapid decline of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation occurs in the presence of N-acetylsphingosine (C2-ceramide), a synthetic cell-permeable ceramide analog. An investigation of the site of ceramide action revealed that the activity of respiratory chain complex III is reduced by C2-ceramide with half-maximum effect at 5–7 μm. In contrast,N-acetylsphinganine (C2-dihydroceramide), which lacks a functionally critical double bond and is ineffective in cells, did not alter mitochondrial respiration or complex III activity.

Mitochondria are considered an early target in TNF-α-induced cytotoxicity because they appear swollen with a reduced number of cristae, in association with profound inhibition of mitochondrial respiration (1Schulze-Ostroff K.

The sphingomyelin pathway has been implicated as a major signaling mechanism mediating the action of a number of extracellular agents (such as TNF-α, Fas ligands, and chemotherapeutic agents) causing the activation of sphingomyelinases that cleave membrane sphingomyelin resulting in the formation of ceramide (10Hannun Y.A.

Synthetic cell-permeable ceramide analogs have been shown to mimic many TNF-α-induced cell responses (10Hannun Y.A.

Science. 1993; 259: 1769-1771Crossref PubMed Scopus (1612) Google Scholar). In malignant and nonmalignant cell lines, ceramides specifically induce apoptosis that involves activation of interleukin-1β-converting enzyme-like proteases, whereas closely related dihydro-analogs are inactive (10Hannun Y.A. Science. 1996; 274: 1855-1859Crossref PubMed Scopus (1497) Google Scholar). The intracellular targets for ceramide are poorly understood. Some of the cellular activities of ceramide appear to be mediated by ceramide-activated protein phosphatase (CAPP), proline-directed protein kinase, and protein kinase C (10Hannun Y.A. Science. 1996; 274: 1855-1859Crossref PubMed Scopus (1497) Google Scholar, 14Lui J. Mathias S. Yang Z. Kolesnick R.N. J. Biol.

Chem. 1993; 268: 15523-15530Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Given the multiplicity of TNF-α cellular effects that involve the activation of several signal transduction pathways, the impairment of mitochondrial respiration could have no causative links with the sphingomyelin signaling pathway. Alternatively, it could occur downstream of ceramide, for example, via the phosphorylation/dephosphorylation mechanism driven by CAPP. We propose that mitochondrial dysfunction results from the direct interaction of ceramide with mitochondrial respiratory chain. It is noteworthy that physiologically relevant and direct targets of ceramide are affected by ceramide in vitro, and only they could mediate the most proximal effects of ceramide in cells (10Hannun Y.A. Science. 1996; 274: 1855-1859Crossref PubMed Scopus (1497) Google Scholar). To gain an insight into the mechanism of mitochondrial damage in TNF-α-treated cells, we tested the hypothesis that mitochondrial function is directly modulated by ceramide using isolated mitochondria. N-Acetylsphingosine (C2-ceramide), N-acetylsphinganine (C2-dihydroceramide), and N-hexanoylsphingosine (C6-ceramide) were obtained from Matreya. Decylubiquinone, cytochrome c, myelin basic protein, okadaic acid, and H7 were obtained from Sigma. Other chemicals were obtained from commercial sources and were reagent grade or better. Rat heart mitochondria were isolated as described previously (16Palmer J.W. Tandler B. Hoppel C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 8731-8739Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), except that a modified Chappell-Perry buffer (Buffer A: 100 mm KCl, 50 mm MOPS, 1 mm EGTA, 5 mmMgSO4, 1 mm ATP, pH 7.4) was used for mitochondrial isolation. Briefly, cardiac tissue was finely minced, placed in buffer A supplemented with 0.2% bovine serum albumin (BSA), and homogenized with a Polytron tissue processor (Brinkman Instruments Inc.) for 2.5 s at a reostat setting of 6.0. The polytron homogenate was centrifuged at 500 × g to separate the subsarcolemmal mitochondria (SSM) from myofibrils. The supernatant containing the SSM was saved, and the pellet was washed by resuspension in the buffer A supplemented with 0.2% BSA and recentrifuged at 500 × g. The combined supernatants were centrifuged at 3000 × g for 10 min to sediment SSM, washed twice, and then suspended in a small volume of buffer B (100 mm KCl, 50 mm MOPS, 0.5 mm EGTA, pH 7.4). The myofibrillar pellet containing the interfibrillar mitochondria (IFM) was resuspended in buffer A, nagarse was added to a final concentration of 5 mg/g weight of tissue, and the suspension was immediately homogenized with Potter-Elvehjem homogenizer. Termination of the action of nagarse was accomplished by the addition of buffer A containing 0.2% BSA, followed by centrifugation at 5000 × g. The pellet was resuspended in buffer A containing 0.2% BSA and centrifuged at 500 × g to sediment myofibrillar debris. The pellet was washed, and the combined supernatants containing the IFM were centrifuged at 3000 × g for 10 min to pellet IFM. IFM were washed twice and suspended in a small volume of buffer B. Protein concentration was assayed by Biuret method with BSA as the standard. Rat skeletal muscle mitochondria were isolated essentially as described (16Palmer J.W. Tandler B. Hoppel C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 8731-8739Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) for interfibrillar subpopulation of heart mitochondria. Rat liver mitochondria were isolated as described (17Hoppel C.L. DiMarco J.P. Tandler B. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 4164-4170Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). HL-60 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with a nutrient mixture of Ham's F-12 (Sigma) containing 10% fetal calf serum plus an antibiotic/antimicotic mixture (Life Technologies, Inc.) and incubated at 37 °C with 5% CO2. Oxygen consumption by intact mitochondria was measured in a chamber equipped with a Clark type oxygen electrode (Yellow Springs Instrument Co.) at 30 °C. The incubations contained 0.5 mg/ml mitochondrial protein in 80 mm KCl, 50 mm MOPS, 5 mmKH2PO4, 1 mm EGTA, 0.1%, BSA, pH 7.4. After depletion of endogenous substrates by the addition of ADP, the substrate was added to the incubation. Then state 3 respiration was initiated by the addition of ADP or the uncoupled respiration rate was determined in the presence of the uncoupler, 2,4-dinitrophenol. Mitochondrial oxidase activities were determined with freeze-thawed mitochondria as described (18Krahenbuhl S. Chang M. Brass M. Hoppel C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20998-21003Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and were performed at 30 °C using an oxygen electrode. Incubations contained 20 mm KH2PO4, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.32 mm oxidized cytochromec, mitochondrial protein, and substrates, which were added last. Activities were determined in the absence and in the presence of specific inhibitors. NADH oxidase activity was measured with 2.8 mm NADH and 7.5 μm rotenone as inhibitor. Durohydroquinol oxidase was measured with 2 mmdurohydroquinol and 18 μm antimycin A as inhibitor. Cytochrome c oxidase was measured in the presence of 10 mm ascorbate and 1 mm N,N,N′,N′-tetramethyl-p-phenylenediamine, with and without 2 mm sodium azide as inhibitor. Complex III (decylubiquinol:ferricytochrome c oxidoreductase) activity was measured using a diode array spectrophotometer by following the increase in reduced cytochrome c absorbance as described (19Krahenbuhl S. Talos C. Wiesmann U. Hoppel C.L. Clin. Chim. Acta. 1994; 230: 177-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Mitochondria (1 mg/ml) were solubilized with 2% sodium cholate in 25 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.4, diluted 10-fold with 25 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.4, and this diluted solution was used for the measurement of complex III activity. The assay mixture contained 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 0.1 mm EDTA, 60 μm cytochrome c, 3 mm sodium azide, and 50 mmKH2PO4, pH 7.4. The mitochondrial sample (2 μg of mitochondrial protein or 0.07 μg of purified complex III or 80 μg of cellular protein) was added last into 1 ml of the assay mixture followed by the addition of ceramides where stated. After a 2-min equilibration period, the reaction was started by the addition of 100 μm decylubiquinol, and the increase in absorbance at 550 nm was monitored for 1 min. The initial rate was linear during the first 60 s. The activity was measured with and without 18 μm antimycin A in parallel cuvettes. The antimycin A-insensitive component, which represents nonenzymatic reduction of cytochrome c, was less than 20% of the total activity. The activity was calculated using an extinction coefficient of 19.1 mm−1 cm−1 for reduced cytochromec and was expressed as the antimycin A-sensitive rate. The specific activity of the enzyme is expressed as micromoles of cytochrome c reduced/min per mg of enzyme protein. Decylubiquinol was synthesized according to Ref. 18Krahenbuhl S. Chang M. Brass M. Hoppel C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20998-21003Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar by reduction of decylubiquinone (10 μmol) with NaBH4 in 2 ml of a 1:1 ethanol:H2O mixture (v/v, pH 2). The decylubiquinol formed was extracted twice with 1 ml of diethylether:isooctane 2:1 (v/v). The combined organic phases were washed with 2 ml of 2 m NaCl and evaporated to dryness at room temperature under a steam of nitrogen. The residue was dissolved in ethanol, and the resulting light yellow solution was acidified by the addition of 10 μl of 0.1m HCl. This solution was stable for at least 3 months when stored at −20 °C under light protection. Treatment of isolated heart mitochondria oxidizing glutamate in the presence of ADP (state 3) with C2-ceramide resulted in immediate inhibition of ATP synthesis coupled respiration (Fig.1). Preincubation of mitochondria with C2-ceramide for 1–5 min did not increase the effect (data not shown). There was no change in the state 2 (only substrate for respiration is present) and state 4 (ADP-limiting) respiration rates in mitochondria treated with C2-ceramide at a concentration of 1–50 μm, compared with control (data not shown). Therefore, the permeability of the mitochondrial inner membrane was not affected by C2-ceramide under this condition. The sensitivity of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (state 3 respiration) to ceramide inhibition varied depending upon the tissue. Liver mitochondria were most sensitive (IC50 = 20 μm), followed by subsarcolemmal and interfibrillar heart mitochondria (IC50 = 28–31 μm). Mitochondria isolated from skeletal muscle were the least sensitive to ceramide with IC50 = 42 μm. In our experiments, glutamate was used as the substrate for mitochondrial respiration. Glutamate enters mitochondria via a specific transporter and is metabolized in the mitochondrial matrix by glutamate dehydrogenase generating NADH that in turn is oxidized by respiratory chain enzymes resulting in formation of ATP. The C2-ceramide-induced decrease in the state 3 respiration rate could be due to inhibition of substrate transporter, glutamate dehydrogenase activity, inhibition of respiratory chain enzyme activity(s), and/or inhibition of ATP synthesis machinery (ATP synthase, adenine nucleotide translocase, and phosphate transporter). To exclude the ATP synthesis machinery as a potential site of ceramide action, we treated mitochondria with C2-ceramide in the presence of uncoupler (2,4-dinitrophenol). The dose response of uncoupled mitochondria in the presence of C2-ceramide was almost identical to that seen with phosphorylating mitochondria (Fig.2). These results suggest that the substrate transporter, glutamate dehydrogenase, or the respiratory chain enzymes could be the sites of C2-ceramide attack. To rule out the possibility that C2-ceramide affects substrate transporter and glutamate dehydrogenase, we used mitochondria that had been subjected to a freeze-thawing cycle that makes the mitochondria permeable to NADH. Thus, in permeabilized mitochondria, NADH can be used as a substrate and is readily oxidized by respiratory chain enzymes. NADH oxidation requires the activity of complexes I, III, and IV. In the presence of C2-ceramide, a profound decrease in NADH oxidase activity occurred (Fig.3), indicating that C2-ceramide indeed inhibits respiratory chain enzyme activity. Activities of other mitochondrial oxidases were further investigated to define the site of ceramide-induced inhibition of oxidative phosphorylation. C2-ceramide brought about a dose-dependent reduction in duroquinol oxidase (requires complex III and IV) but not in cytochrome c oxidase (requires complex IV; Fig. 3). Analysis of oxidase activity measurements reveals complex III as a primary site of C2-ceramide action. However, the coexisting block of complex I activity by C2-ceramide can be masked because of the complex III inhibition. To definitively examine C2-ceramide effect on the complex III, we measured maximally expressed activity of the complex III (decylubiquinol: ferricytochrome c oxidoreductase) in detergent treated mitochondria. C2-ceramide caused significant reduction of the complex III activity with an IC50 of 5 μm (Fig.4). Increases in C2-ceramide concentrations resulted in increased inhibition of complex III activity up to 80% of control at 20 μm. Complex III has been shown to exert a low degree of control on electron flux through the mitochondrial respiratory chain (20Taylor R.W. Birch-Machin M.A. Lowerson S.A. Turnbull D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3523-3528Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), implying that marked changes of complex III activity must occur before significant decreases in maximal respiration rate are detected. Therefore, it was expected that the profound C2-ceramide-induced decline of complex III activity at a concentration of 5–10 μm remains undetected by respiration rate measurement in intact mitochondria (compare Figs. 2 and 4). Although C2-ceramide seems to interact with complex III directly in isolated mitochondria within 2 min of incubation, it is still possible that ceramide effect is mediated by phosphorylation/dephosphorylation events. Therefore, we determined the C2-ceramide-induced reduction of complex III activity in the presence of CAPP inhibitor, okadaic acid (50 nm) or proline-directed protein kinase substrate, myelin basic protein (50 μm), or the protein kinase C inhibitor H7 (14 μm) (10Hannun Y.A. Science. 1996; 274: 1855-1859Crossref PubMed Scopus (1497) Google Scholar, 14Lui J. Mathias S. Yang Z. Kolesnick R.N. J. Biol.

None of these compounds blocked the C2-ceramide inhibition of complex III activity in isolated mitochondria, indicating the lack of involvement of the intermediates in the effect of C2-ceramide. To further support the view that C2-ceramide directly interacts with mitochondrial complex III, we assessed the C2-ceramide effect on the activity of purified complex III, which has been isolated from the beef heart mitochondria and purified to homogeneity (Fig.5). The activity of the purified complex III was decreased in concentration-dependent fashion up to 93% in the presence of 20 μm C2-ceramide (Fig. 5, curve 2) with half-maximum effect at 7 μm.Figure 5C 2 -ceramide inhibits the activity of purified complex III. Complex III isolated from beef heart mitochondria was incubated as described under “Materials and Methods.” The activity was expressed as the antimycin A-sensitive rate. 1, in the presence of C2-dihydroceramide;2, in the presence of C2-ceramide. The values are the means ± S.D. from three measurements. Similar results were obtained in two independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Next, it was important to establish specificity of ceramide inhibition of mitochondrial complex III. Low concentrations of C6-ceramide (1–5 μm), another synthetic cell-permeable ceramide analog, were as effective as C2-ceramide (Fig. 4). However, greater concentrations of C6-ceramide did not produce further reduction of complex III activity. The reason for such an interaction of C6-ceramide with the complex III is unclear and is currently under investigation in this laboratory. A close structural analog of C2-ceramide, C2-dihydroceramide, lacks the 4,5-trans-double bond in the sphingoid backbone, which has been shown to be critical for imparting the biological activity of ceramide (12Bielawska A. Crane H.M. Liotta D. Obeid L.M. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26226-26232Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). C2-dihydroceramide (5–20 μm) did not affect the complex III activity (Fig. 4 and Fig. 5, curve 1) nor oxidative phosphorylation (data not shown). Therefore, the ability of C2-ceramide to inhibit complex III activity is due to specific structural requirements as opposed to nonspecific hydrophobic interactions. Evidence has recently been provided that ceramide contents in mitochondria isolated from the cells exposed to TNF-α are greatly elevated (21Garcia-Ruiz C. Colell A. Mari M. Morales A. Fernandez-Checa J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11369-11377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar). The mechanism underlying the accumulation of ceramide in mitochondria is unclear, although the data indicate that ceramide is not locally produced. Having demonstrated the direct inhibition of complex III activity by C2-ceramide in isolated mitochondria, we sought to determine if treatment of the cells with TNF-α or C2-ceramide inhibits mitochondrial complex III activity. The HL-60 cells were incubated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (without serum) with 15 μmC2-ceramide or 80 ng/ml of TNF-α at 37 °C for 3 h and then washed with phosphate-buffered saline and collected in 25 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 2% sodium cholate. The activity of complex III was 35 and 45% lower in the cells treated with C2-ceramide and TNF-α, respectively, compared with control. Taken together these data suggest that the inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α leads to increased generation of ceramide followed by ceramide trafficking to mitochondria where ceramide interacts directly with complex III. This study further supports the notion that ceramide is a new modulator of respiratory chain function in mitochondria. An appreciation of the mechanisms by which mitochondria are integrated in cellular metabolism has evolved considerably in several decades of intensive investigation. But, the signal transduction pathways regulating mitochondrial function are just being explored. It has been established that Ca2+and cAMP are the second messengers that control mitochondrial enzyme activities such as matrix dehydrogenases and oxidative phosphorylation (22McCormack J.G. Halestrap A. Denton R.M. Physiol. Rev. 1990; 70: 391-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (1162) Google Scholar, 23Romani A. Dowell E Scarpa A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24376-24384Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our data indicate that sphingomyelin-dependent signal transduction pathway may participate in regulation of vital mitochondrial function. The data presented here suggest that mitochondrial respiratory complex III is a novel direct target of ceramide in cells. Our findings demonstrating the inhibition of complex III by ceramide in mitochondria have extended previous observations that mitochondrial respiration is impaired in the cells treated with TNF-α (1Schulze-Ostroff K. Bakker A.C. Vanhaesebroeck B. Beyaert R. Jacob W.A. Fiers W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5317-5323Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Lancaster Jr., J.R. Laster S.M. Gooding L.R.

Blood. 1996; 87: 2401-2410Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and have also defined the mechanism of TNF-α effect on mitochondria. A rapid response of isolated mitochondria and purified complex III to ceramide treatment seems to exclude the involvement of intermediates. The concentrations of C2-ceramide that were required for complex III inhibition are similar to those employed in studies of the effects of ceramide in vivo (Refs. 13Obeid L.M. Linardic C.M. Karolak L.A. Hannun Y.A. Science. 1993; 259: 1769-1771Crossref PubMed Scopus (1612) Google Scholar, 24Okazaki T. Bielawska A. Bell R.M. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol.

The profound inhibition of complex III activity by C2-ceramide but not by C2-dihydroceramide, which also is inactive in cells, implicates complex III as a potential mediator of proximal ceramide effects in cells. Whereas the specific mechanism whereby mitochondrial complex III can transduce the effects of ceramide is not known, there is a possibility that generation of free radical plays a role. Mammalian complex III is an 11-subunit protein complex that links proton translocation to electron transfer from ubiquinol to cytochrome c by the proton motive Q cycle mechanism (26Mitchell P. FEBS Lett. 1975; 56: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar, 27Trumpower B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11409-11412Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Complex III has been established as an important source of oxygen radical production in the mitochondrial respiratory chain, the radicals being formed at the level of ubiquinone (28Cadenas E. Boveris A. Biochem. J. 1980; 188: 31-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Inhibitors of cytochrome b reoxidation via center i in the Q-cycle (antimycin A, for example) potentiate autooxidation of unstable ubisemiquinone resulting in an increased oxygen radical generation (29Turrens J.F. Alexandre A. Lehninger A.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1985; 237: 408-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (1070) Google Scholar). Whether ceramide affects cytochrome b reoxidation in the Q-cycle with subsequent generation of oxygen radicals certainly requires further investigation. This is in line with the recent study by Garcia-Ruiz et al.(21Garcia-Ruiz C. Colell A. Mari M. Morales A. Fernandez-Checa J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11369-11377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar) where C2-ceramide treatment of isolated mitochondria led to the generation of hydrogen peroxide, which was dependent on the electron transport in the respiratory chain. In TNF-α- and C2-ceramide-treated cells, increased mitochondrial oxygen radical formation was also detected (7Hennet T. Richter C. Peterans E. Biochem. J. 1993; 289: 587-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar, 9Goossens V. Grooten J. De Vos K. Fiers W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8115-8119Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar, 21Garcia-Ruiz C. Colell A. Mari M. Morales A. Fernandez-Checa J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11369-11377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar). Additionally, a recent report has described the opening of mitochondrial permeability transition pore (PTP) as an essential feature of the TNF-α cytotoxicity in L929 fibroblasts. Ceramide was able to replace TNF-α both in inducing PTP and in killing the cells (30Pastorino J.G. Simbula G. Yamamoto K. Glascott Jr., P.A. Rothman R.J. Farber J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29792-29798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Thus, these data support the role of ceramide in the mitochondrial effects of TNF-α. In isolated mitochondria, the opening of PTP results in dissipation of an inner mitochondrial membrane potential, uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation (increase in respiration state 4 rate), loss of low molecular solutes from mitochondrial matrix, and swelling of mitochondria (31Gunter T.E. Gunter K.K. Sheu S.-S. Gavin C.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 267: C313-C339Crossref Google Scholar). In our experiments, the uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation that is suggestive of PTP opening was not detected, whereas complex III activity was reduced following ceramide treatment of mitochondria. This observation raises the possibility that mitochondrial PTP opening is proximal to ceramide binding to complex III. It is noteworthy that this pore can develop in isolated mitochondria and cells under the oxidative stress condition associated with increased free radical generation (32Duchen M.R. McGuinness O. Brown L.A. Crompton M. Cardiovasc. Res. 1993; 27: 1790-1794Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Also, antioxidants can prevent the PTP opening (33Gudz T. Eriksson O. Kushnareva Y. Saris N.-E. Novgorodov S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 342: 143-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Certainly, it remains to be determined whether ceramide binding to complex III causes excessive free radical generation that favors the subsequent PTP opening or ceramide interacts with multiple sites in mitochondria via different mechanisms. A clearer understanding of the mechanisms responsible for modulation of mitochondrial function by ceramide may prove critical to the study of signal transduction pathways involved in growth suppression and apoptosis.

The transcription factor NF-κB has been widely studied as a regulator of genes involved in immune and inflammatory responses. A variety of stimuli activate NF-κB through the induced phosphorylation and degradation of the inhibitor IκB followed by nuclear translocation of NF-κB. We show here that oncogenic forms of Ha-Ras activate NF-κB, not through induced nuclear translocation, but rather through the activation of the transcriptional function of the NF-κB RelA/p65 subunit. Importantly, RelA/p65 −/− cells are inefficient in the activation of κB-dependent gene expression in response to oncogenic Ras expression. Furthermore, IκBα expression blocks focus formation in NIH3T3 cells induced by oncogenic Ras. These results demonstrate that NF-κB is a critical downstream mediator of Ha-Ras signaling and oncogenic potential.

Members of the Ras family of GTP-binding proteins serve as essential mediators in the ability of a variety of extracellular stimuli to regulate cellular proliferation and differentiation (1Boguski M.S.

Oncogenic mutations in ras alleles, which occur in approximately 30% of human cancers, lead to chronic GTP binding, which initiates the activation of signal transduction cascades. In this regard, Ras is known to stimulate both the Raf/MEK 1The abbreviations used are: MEK, MAP/ERK kinase; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; JNK, Jun kinase; CAT, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase; HIV, human immunodeficiency virus; LTR, long terminal repeat; DHFR, dihydrofolate reductase; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; CMV, cytomegalovirus.1The abbreviations used are: MEK, MAP/ERK kinase; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; JNK, Jun kinase; CAT, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase; HIV, human immunodeficiency virus; LTR, long terminal repeat; DHFR, dihydrofolate reductase; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; CMV, cytomegalovirus./ERK pathway as well as the MEKK/SEK/JNK pathway (3Marshall C.J.

The ultimate targets of the Ras-induced signal transduction pathways are transcription factors (see Ref. 4Karin M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16483-16486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2237) Google Scholar), which regulate the expression of genes involved in proliferation and oncogenesis. Two transcription factors, Ets and c-Jun, have been shown to be essential for Ras-induced gene expression and for Ras-mediated cell transformation in vitro and tumorigenesis (11Langer S. Bortner D. Roussel M. Sherr C. Ostrowski M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5355-5362Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 12Johnson R. Spiegelman B. Hanahan D. Wisdom R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4504-4511Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). In these cases, Ras-induced signaling pathways activate the transcriptional function of both Ets and c-Jun via induced phosphorylation of their transcriptional activation domains (Ref. 13Yang B.-S. Hauser C. Henkel G. Colman M. Van Beveren C. Stacey K. Hume D. Maki R. Ostrowski M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 538-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholarand reviewed in Ref. 4Karin M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16483-16486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2237) Google Scholar). The NF-κB family of proteins has been studied largely for the ability of these transcription factors to regulate a variety of genes involved in immune and inflammatory responses (reviewed in Ref. 14Baldwin A. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (5510) Google Scholar). The activation of these genes in response to inflammatory cytokines, T cell activation signals, lipopolysaccharide, etc. involves the targeted phosphorylation and degradation of the NF-κB inhibitor IκB, allowing nuclear translocation of NF-κB (reviewed in Ref. 14Baldwin A. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (5510) Google Scholar). Additionally, growing evidence indicates that NF-κB may play an important role in controlling cellular proliferation. For example, the c-myc proto-oncogene has been shown to be transcriptionally regulated by NF-κB (15La Rosa F. Pierce J. Sonenshein G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1039-1044Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and antisense inhibition of IκBα leads to cellular transformation of NIH3T3 cells (16Beauparlant P. Kwan I. Bitar R. Chou P. Koromilas A. Sonenberg N. Hiscott J. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 3189-3197PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, members of the NF-κB and IκB families are associated with chromosomal translocations found in certain lymphomas (for example, see Ref.17Zhang J. Chang C. Lombardi L. Dalla-Favera R. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 1931-1937PubMed Google Scholar). We and others previously demonstrated that transient transfection of oncogenic forms of Ha-Ras or of Raf-1 leads to the activation of reporter gene expression controlled by multiple NF-κB sites (18Finco T. Baldwin A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17676-17679Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Galang C. Der C. Hauser C. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 2913-2921PubMed Google Scholar). Consistent with the previous co-transfection studies, κB-dependent gene expression was elevated significantly in both Ras- and Raf-transformed cells as compared with the parental 3T3 cells. Interestingly, increased NF-κB binding activity was not detected in the Ras- or Raf-transformed cells. However, the activity of the transcriptional activation domain of the NF-κB RelA/p65 subunit was significantly increased in these cells. p65 −/− fibroblasts exhibited a reduced κB-dependent transcription response to either oncogenic Ras or Raf but retained their ability to activate the p65/RelA transcriptional activation domain. Finally, oncogenic Ras focus-forming activity was blocked by IκBα expression. These data indicate that NF-κB is an important downstream target for Ras-activated signal transduction pathways. NIH3T3 cells, the Ha-Ras and Raf-1-transformed counterparts, and the p65 +/− and p65 −/− mouse embryo fibroblasts were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% calf serum, penicillin, and streptomycin. DNA transfections were performed by the calcium phosphate precipitation method as described previously (18Finco T. Baldwin A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17676-17679Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The plasmid pGEM or salmon sperm DNA was used to equalize the amount of DNA transfected in each experiment to 15 μg. CAT analysis and luciferase assays were performed as previously reported (18Finco T. Baldwin A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17676-17679Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Cogswell P. Mayo M. Baldwin A. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 491-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In all cases, 1 unit of relative activity represents the CAT or luciferase activity obtained after transfection of the reporter gene alone. All experiments were performed at least three times with similar results. The following plasmids have been described previously: activated Raf (RafBXB) and activated Ras (v-Ha-Ras) expression vectors (18Finco T. Baldwin A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17676-17679Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the IκBα expression vector (21Beg A. Ruben S. Scheinman R. Haskill S. Rosen C. Baldwin A.

Biol. 1994; 14: 7226-7234Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), and DHFR-CAT (25Wade M. Blake M. Jambou R. Helin K. Harlow E. Azizkhan J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9783-9791Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts were prepared as described previously (26Finco T. Beg A. Baldwin A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11884-11888Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). For double sucrose pad purification, washed nuclei were resuspended in lysis buffer lacking Nonidet P-40 and layered on a sucrose pad (30% sucrose, 60 mm KCl, 15 mm NaCl, 15 mm Hepes, 2 mm EDTA, 0.75 mmspermidine, 0.15 mm spermine, and 1 mmdithiothreitol) and centrifuged for 15 min at 3,000 rpm in an HB4 rotor. The sucrose pad was then removed, the nuclei resuspended, and the process repeated. Nuclear extracts were then prepared from the sucrose pad-purified nuclei. Gel mobility shift assays (EMSAs) were performed as described previously (26Finco T. Beg A. Baldwin A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11884-11888Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). NIH3T3 cells were transfected by calcium phosphate coprecipitation essentially as described (27Clark G. Westwick J. Der C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1677-1681Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). For each 60-mm plate, 10 ng of Ras expression vector pZip-rasH(61L) was transfected, along with the indicated quantity of IκBα expression vector or empty vector. In all cases, the expression vector was normalized with the cognate empty expression vectors. Cells were fed every 2 days, and the appearance of foci of transformed cells was counted 14 days after transfection. Four plates per condition were transfected, and graphs represent the mean ± S.E. of these counts. Data are representative of four independent experiments performed in quadruplicate. Previous transient cotransfection experiments indicated that expression of either oncogenic Ras or oncogenic Raf led to a significant activation of expression of a κB-dependent reporter (18Finco T. Baldwin A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17676-17679Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Consistent with the previous cotransfection data, the activity of a κB-dependent reporter was significantly elevated in both Ras- and Raf-transformed cells but not in the parental NIH3T3 cells (Fig.1 A). A reporter mutated in the NF-κB sites did not exhibit this enhanced activity, and expression of the NF-κB inhibitor IκBα blocked the Ras- and Raf-induced activation of κB-dependent reporter activity, indicating that NF-κB regulates the transcription response. A similar result was obtained with the NF-κB-dependent HIV-LTR reporter (data not shown). Additionally, expression of the non-Ras-responsive DHFR-CAT reporter was approximately equivalent in each of the three cell types (data not shown) showing that the differential responses observed in the transformed cells were not due to differential uptake of plasmids. To determine if oncogenic Ras as well as oncogenic Raf activated nuclear accumulation of NF-κB, gel mobility shift assays (EMSAs) were performed with nuclear extracts from parental NIH3T3 cells, oncogenic Ras-transformed NIH3T3 cells, or Raf-transformed NIH3T3 cells. To demonstrate that binding activity was exclusively nuclear, extracts were prepared from double sucrose pad-purified nuclei. Immunoblotting for NF-κB1/p105 (which is cytoplasmic) indicated that there was no cytoplasmic contamination in the nuclear preparations (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 2, NF-κB was detected in the nuclei of each of the different cells at similar levels. Antibody “supershift” experiments showed that this binding activity is authentic, p65/RelA-containing NF-κB (data not shown). These results were surprising and indicated that the activation of κB-dependent transcription observed in the transfection experiments shown in Fig. 1 was not controlled by the induced nuclear accumulation of NF-κB but suggested that this response was mediated by the relatively low levels of constitutively nuclear NF-κB in NIH3T3 fibroblasts. It should be noted that transient transfection of oncogenic Ras into 3T3 cells or the induction of oncogenic Ras in Rat-1 cells led to an approximate 3-fold increase in nuclear NF-κB (data not shown); however established Ras-transformed cells did not exhibit this property. These experiments indicated that oncogenic Ras or Raf can activate κB-dependent transcription without enhancing nuclear levels of NF-κB. To explain the activation of κB-dependent transcription by oncogenic forms of Ras or Raf without an induction of NF-κB nuclear translocation, we asked whether the transcriptional activation function of NF-κB was stimulated in the transformed cells. A plasmid (Gal4p65) encoding a fusion of the C-terminal (TA1) transactivation domain of RelA (23Schmitz M. dos Santos Silva M. Baeuerle P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15576-15584Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) with the DNA-binding domain of the yeast transcription factor Gal4 was transfected into parental NIH3T3 cells, or Ras- or Raf-transformed cells, along with a luciferase reporter containing upstream Gal4-binding sites. Luciferase activity driven by Gal4p65 or Gal4 was compared in the three cell types. The results indicate that the Gal4p65 construct is strongly active in the Ras- and the Raf-transformed cells but only weakly active in the untransformed 3T3 cells (Fig.3 A). EMSA experiments indicated that there was not an increase in the DNA binding activity of the Gal4-p65 protein in the Ras- and Raf-transformed cells (data not shown). These results demonstrate that oncogenic Ras or Raf activates a signal transduction pathway that stimulates p65/RelA transcriptional activation function controlled by the TA1 transcriptional activation domain. The results described above suggested that the RelA subunit of NF-κB may function as a critical downstream transcriptional effector for the Ras oncoprotein. To test this hypothesis, we utilized immortalized RelA +/− and RelA −/− embryonic fibroblasts (28Beg A. Sha W. Bronson R. Ghosh S. Baltimore D. Nature. 1995; 376: 167-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (1619) Google Scholar) for transfection and gene expression studies. Oncogenic Ras was ineffective at activating κB-dependent gene expression in the p65 −/− cells (approximately a 2-fold activation), whereas effective Ras activation of κB-dependent gene expression (approximately 7-fold) was observed in the RelA +/− cells, as expected (Fig. 3 B). To show that the Ras-responsive signal transduction pathway was still operative in the RelA −/− cells, the Gal4p65 construct was cotransfected with either activated Ha-Ras or activated Raf-1. Ras activated the Gal4p65 construct as effectively in RelA +/− cells as in RelA −/− cells. These results demonstrate that the RelA/p65 subunit of NF-κB is required for oncogenic Ras to effectively activate gene expression driven by consensus NF-κB-binding sites. To determine whether NF-κB is required for cellular transformation controlled by oncogenic Ha-Ras, we determined whether the inhibition of NF-κB would affect the ability of Ras to cause formation of transformed foci in cultured NIH3T3 cells. To specifically inhibit NF-κB activity, we used an expression vector encoding IκBα, which can enter the nucleus and relocate NF-κB to the cytoplasm (29Arenzana-Seisdedos F. Thompson J. Rodriguez M. Bachelerie F. Thomas D. Hay R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2689-2696Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Transfection of pZIP-ras(61L) together with the empty CMV vector yielded an average of approximately 160 foci/plate (Fig. 4). Co-expression of oncogenic Ras with wild-type IκBα blocked focus formation activity by greater than 50%. Co-expression with a super-repressor form of IκBα (mutated in serines 32 and 36) that is unable to be inducibly phosphorylated or degraded in response to stimuli (see Ref. 22Wang C.-Y. Mayo M. Baldwin A. Science. 1996; 274: 784-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (2498) Google Scholar) blocked focus formation by approximately 70–75% (Fig. 4). Expression of IκBα did not block expression of the promoter driving Ras expression or Ras protein expression (data not shown). Interestingly, IκBα was unable to block the ability of activated Rho (Rho63L) to induce focus formation. In these experiments, activated Rho yielded approximately 20 foci/plate, and IκBα expression did not reduce this number of foci (data not shown). The data presented here indicate that oncogenic rasalleles activate NF-κB-dependent transcription, not through the induced nuclear translocation of NF-κB, but rather through the stimulation of the transcriptional activation function of NF-κB via the targeting of the RelA/p65 subunit. Furthermore, the data indicate that NF-κB is required for Ras to initiate efficient cellular transformation and that NF-κB plays a role in mediating certain essential aspects of cellular transformation. Thus, NF-κB joins Ets family members (13Yang B.-S. Hauser C. Henkel G. Colman M. Van Beveren C. Stacey K. Hume D. Maki R. Ostrowski M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 538-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar) and c-Jun (4Karin M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16483-16486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2237) Google Scholar, 12Johnson R. Spiegelman B. Hanahan D. Wisdom R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4504-4511Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar) as downstream targets of oncogenic Ras that are required for Ras-mediated cellular transformation. How does Ras activate NF-κB functional activity? Our data strongly indicate that the transcriptional activation function of RelA/p65 NF-kB is potentiated in both Ras- as well as Raf-transformed cells, and at least two mechanisms exist to explain this phenomenon. First, a Ras-initiated signal transduction pathway may target the p65 transcriptional activation domain for phosphorylation, which may allow enhanced interactions with a transcriptional co-activator or with basal transcriptional machinery. Such a mechanism appears to be operative for both Ets-1 and -2 and for c-Jun (4Karin M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16483-16486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2237) Google Scholar, 13Yang B.-S. Hauser C. Henkel G. Colman M. Van Beveren C. Stacey K. Hume D. Maki R. Ostrowski M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 538-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). A second mechanism may be that a transcriptional co-activator is modified such that it interacts functionally with p65 transcriptional activation domain. Also of importance is identification of the signal transduction pathway that is initiated by Ras to stimulate NF-κB transcriptional activity. Since both oncogenic Ras as well as oncogenic Raf stimulate κB-dependent activity, it may be assumed that the relevant pathway is downstream of Raf and is, therefore, the MEK/ERK pathway. However, inhibitors of this pathway did not block the ability of Ras to activate κB-dependent transcription, and dominant negative forms of kinases in the SEK/JNK pathway were able to block this response. 2J. Norris and A. S. Baldwin, Jr., unpublished observations. Thus the ability of Raf to activate κB-dependent gene expression in a MEK/ERK-independent pathway may be explained by the recent observation that Raf stimulates JNK activity via an autocrine mechanism (30McCarthy S. Samuels M. Pritchard C. Abraham J. McMahon M. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1953-1964Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Prior studies have shown that the major regulatory mechanism involved in regulating κB-dependent transcription is induced nuclear translocation (see Ref. 14Baldwin A. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (5510) Google Scholar). Our data indicate that significant κB-dependent transcription can be realized without enhancing the constitutive, low nuclear levels of NF-κB. This suggests that under some circumstances the functional activity of NF-κB can be separated from induction of nuclear translocation. Consistent with this concept are the recent observations that the tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein blocks the ability of NF-κB to stimulate transcription of an NF-κB-dependent reporter but is not able to block nuclear translocation of NF-κB (31Yoza B. Hu J. McCall C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18306-18309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) and that phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate can activate the TA2 transcriptional activation domain of RelA/p65 (23Schmitz M. dos Santos Silva M. Baeuerle P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15576-15584Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Evidence that NF-κB is required for Ras-mediated cellular transformation is consistent with several observations indicating a role for NF-κB in controlling cell growth. First, it has been shown that NF-κB can regulate c-myc gene expression. Second, antisense studies indicate that NF-κB can control oncogenesis. These experiments utilized antisense to p65 to block oncogene-controlled transformation (32Kitajima I. Shinohara T. Bilakovics J. Brown D. Xu X. Nerenberg M. Science. 1992; 258: 1792-1795Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar, 33Higgins K. Perez J. Coleman T. Dorshkind K. McComas W. Sarmiento U. Rosen C. Narayanan R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Hiscott J. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 3189-3197PubMed Google Scholar). Additionally, other oncogenes such as Her2/NEU are known to activate NF-κB (34Galang C. Garcia-Ramirez J. Solski P. Westwick J. Der C. Neznanov N. Oshima R. Hauser C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7992-7998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Thus, the activation of NF-κB may be common to a number of oncogenes, particularly those that utilize Ras-controlled signaling pathways. Additionally, we have been able to show NF-κB activation is required to block a Ras-induced apoptotic response. 3M. Mayo and A. S. Baldwin, Jr., submitted for publication. This result is consistent with recent data (22Wang C.-Y. Mayo M. Baldwin A. Science. 1996; 274: 784-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (2498) Google Scholar, 35Beg A. Baltimore D.

https://openalex.org/W2162632054,"Members of the kinesin superfamily share a similar motor catalytic domain yet move either toward the plus end (e.g., conventional kinesin) or the minus end (e.g., Ncd) of microtubules. The structural features that determine the polarity of movement have remained enigmatic. Here, we show that kinesin's catalytic domain (316 residues) in a dimeric construct (560 residues) can be replaced with the catalytic domain of Ncd and that the resultant motor moves in the kinesin direction. We also demonstrate that this chimera does not move processively over many tubulin subunits, which is similar to Ncd but differs from the highly processive motion of conventional kinesin. These findings reveal that the catalytic domain contributes to motor processivity but does not control the polarity of movement. We propose that a region adjacent to the catalytic domain serves as a mechanical transducer that determines directionality."

Excess, autoreactive, or damaged cells have the ability to self-destruct by a process termed apoptosis. When properly controlled, apoptosis maintains tissue homeostasis. However, dysregulation of apoptosis, resulting in the abnormal accumulation or destruction of cells, is involved in the pathogenesis of a variety of disorders including autoimmune disease, cancer, and AIDS (1Thompson C.B. Science. 1995; 267: 1456-1462Crossref PubMed Scopus (6205) Google Scholar). The signaling pathways controlling apoptosis are beginning to be defined. One such pathway is triggered by the cell surface receptor Fas, a member of the tumor necrosis receptor family expressed in a wide variety of tissues including thymus, liver, heart, kidney, and lymphoid and nonlymphoid malignancies (2Itoh N.

After caspase-8 binds to FADD/MORT1, additional members of the caspase family are sequentially activated and subsequently cleave proteins such as poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, leading to the characteristic morphologic changes of apoptosis. Many Fas-expressing cells are not sensitive to Fas-induced apoptosis, suggesting that cellular factors exist that inhibit Fas signaling.

Another potential inhibitor of Fas signaling is nitric oxide (NO), 1The abbreviations used are: NO, nitric oxide; NOS, nitric-oxide synthase; iNOS, calcium-independent NOS; PARP, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase; l-NMA,N G-monomethyl-l-arginine; HIV-1, human immunodeficiency virus, type 1; EBV, Epstein-Barr virus; ODQ,1H-[1,2,3]Oxadiazolo[4,3-a]quinoxalin-1-one. or related molecules, synthesized by the enzyme NO synthase (NOS), of which there are three major isoforms (37Nathan C. Xie Q.W. Cell. 1994; 78: 915-918Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2758) Google Scholar). In previous studies, we demonstrated that low level basal NOS activity inhibits spontaneous apoptosis in certain human B cell lines. Because Fas is a critical regulator of apoptosis, we were interested in whether NOS also modulates Fas-induced apoptosis in human leukocytes. Such a role for NO would strengthen the case for its involvement in the human immune response, which has been difficult to demonstrate. Cell lines were obtained from the ATCC (Jurkat, H9, 2F7, and 10C9), or from the laboratory of Dr. Elliott Kieff (IB4 and BJAB). 100 μl of BJAB or 10C9 cells that had been fed 1–3 days previously and were growing logarithmically (approximately 500,000 cells/ml) in RPMI 1640 containing 1 mml-arginine (Sigma) and 10% fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.) were plated in 96 well plates. 100 μl of modified RPMI 1640 10% fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc. SelectAmine) were added to each well to bring the finall-arginine concentration to 0.5 mm. The Fas agonist monoclonal antibody clone CH-11, IgM (Upstate Biotechnology) was added to the appropriate wells at 5–10 ng/ml for BJAB cultures and 5–20 ng/ml for 10C9 cultures. l-NMA (5 mm versus 0.5 mml-arginine in the medium), l-arginine (2.5–5 mm), orS-nitrosopenicillamine (10–100 μm) was added to the indicated wells. After 24–48 h, the percentage of apoptotic cells was determined by staining the cells with acridine orange as described below. 30 μl of cells from each culture were pelletted, and 10 μl of cell slurry was mixed with 10 μl of acridine orange (5 μg/ml) diluted in phosphate-buffered saline. The percentage of cells with apoptotic morphology (nuclear and cytoplasmic condensation, nuclear fragmentation, membrane blebbing, and apoptotic body formation) was then analyzed on a wet mount slide using a Zeiss Axioskop equipped with epifluorescence. Cells were stained with propidium iodine as described previously (38Nicoletti I. Migliorati G. Pagliacci M.C. Grignani F. Riccardi C. J. Immunol. Methods. 1991; 139: 271-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (4431) Google Scholar). The percentage of apoptotic cells was quantitated using a Facscan Flow Cytometer (Becton Dickinson). Fluorescence data were collected using logarithmic amplification, and necrotic debris and cellular aggregates were eliminated from the data by forward and right angle light scatter gates. Apoptotic cells were distinguished from nonapoptotic intact cells by their decreased DNA content as determined by lower propidium iodine staining intensity. Whole cell lysates were made by boiling cells in sample buffer (62.5 mm Tris-Cl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 20% glycerol, 10% 2-mercaptoethanol). Proteins in the cell lysates were then separated by SDS/polyacrylamide gel (7%) electrophoresis and transferred to nitrocellulose. Rabbit anti-iNOS (used at a 1:500 dilution) and rabbit anti-PARP (Upstate Biotechnology Inc., 1 μg/ml) were used as primary antibodies for Western blots, and horseradish peroxidase-labeled goat-anti-rabbit Ig was used as a secondary antibody (Amersham Corp.). The blots were developed using enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) as per the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Corp.). Cells were incubated in the presence or the absence of 2 μg/ml of Fas monoclonal antibody (clone CH-11, IgM, Upstate Biotechnology Inc.) for 60 min at 4 °C, followed by three washes in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% fetal bovine serum and sodium azide. The cells were then incubated with fluorescein-conjugated goat-anti-mouse Ig (Jackson Labs) for 45 min at 4 °C, washed three times, and resuspended in 1% formalin. The percentage of Fas-positive cells was quantitated using a Facscan Flow Cytometer (Becton Dickinson). To confirm that human leukocytes are capable of synthesizing NO (and related species) intracellularly, iNOS expression (the main NOS isoform expressed in murine leukocytes) was analyzed by Western blot analysis in multiple human leukocytic cell lines. Basal expression of iNOS was detected in all human B cell, T cell, and monocytic cell lines tested (Fig.1). The effects of NOS on Fas-induced apoptosis was examined initially in BJAB, the human B cell line that in previous studies contained the highest levels of basal NOS activity (39Mannick J.B. Asano K. Izumi K. Kieff E. Stamler J.S. Cell. 1994; 79: 1137-1146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar). Fas was ligated on the surface of BJAB cells with anti-Fas monoclonal antibody (5–10 ng/ml clone CH-11, IgM, Upstate Biotechnology) in the presence or the absence of the competitive NOS inhibitor l-NMA. NOS inhibition significantly increased Fas-induced apoptosis (Figs. 2,A and B), suggesting that constitutive NOS activity attenuates Fas-mediated apoptosis. Confirming that the effects of l-NMA were due to a specific inhibition of NOS, the enzyme substrate l-arginine and the NO donorsS-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine (Fig.2 A) or sodium nitroprusside (data not shown), partially reversed the inhibition. These findings were reproduced in another Burkitt's lymphoma B cell line, 10C9, which is derived from a patient infected with human immunodeficiency virus, type 1 (HIV-1). That is, inhibition of NOS by l-NMA significantly increased Fas-induced apoptosis in 10C9 cells (Fig. 2 C), and the effects were reversed by both l-arginine and the NO donorsS-nitrosopenicillamine (Fig. 2 C) or sodium nitroprusside (data not shown).Figure 2NOS inhibits Fas-induced apoptosis in Burkitt's lymphoma cells.

B, BJAB cells were grown for 48 h in the presence of medium alone (Control), Fas agonist antibody (Fas), Fas agonist antibody in combination with l-NMA (Fas+ l-NMA), or l-NMA alone (l-NMA). The cells were then stained with propidium iodine and analyzed by flow cytometry. Apindicates the apoptotic population. The results are representative of one of four separate experiments. C, the same experiment was performed as in A using 10C9 cells. The results indicate the mean ± S.E. of 6–25 separate experiments. * indicatesp = 0.001 versus F; † indicatesp = 0.05; and ∧ indicates p = 0.02versus Fas agonist antibody together with l-NMA. These results were confirmed by DNA laddering analysis (data not shown).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We next analyzed whether our findings in human B lymphoma cell lines were generalizable to other human cell lines of hematopoietic lineage.l-NMA increased Fas-induced apoptosis in the T lymphoma cell line H9, the T leukemia cell line Jurkat, the promonocytic cell line U937, the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)+ B lymphoblastoid cell line IB4, and in the EBV + AIDS-related Burkitt's lymphoma B cell line 2F7 (Fig. 3). Thus intracellular NOS activity may be a general mechanism by which transformed cells of hematopoietic lineage inhibit Fas-induced apoptosis. Significant inhibitory effects of NOS on platelets and smooth muscle derive from increases in cGMP levels due to activation of soluble guanylyl cyclase (40Ignarro L.J. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1990; 30: 535-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (1224) Google Scholar, 41Moncada S. Palmer R.M. Higgs E.A. Pharmacol. Rev. 1991; 43: 109-142PubMed Google Scholar). However, the inhibitory effects of NOS on Fas-induced apoptosis appear to be cGMP-independent: the cell permeable cGMP analog, 8-bromo-cGMP (0.1–1 mm) failed to overcome the effects of l-NMA (Fig.4). Although the guanylyl cyclase inhibitors 1H-[1,2,3]oxadiazolo[4,3-a]quinoxalin-1-one (ODQ) and LY 83583 (10–100 μm) increased spontaneous as well as Fas-induced apoptosis, the mechanism did not appear to be due to a specific inhibition of guanylyl cyclase, because the apoptosis was not prevented by 8-bromo-cGMP (0.1–1 mm) (Fig. 4). One mechanism by which NOS could inhibit Fas-induced apoptosis is to decrease Fas expression levels on cells. To test this hypothesis, 10C9 B cells or H9 T cells were grown in the presence or the absence of the NOS inhibitorl-NMA, and Fas expression was analyzed by immunofluorescent staining and flow cytometry. l-NMA had no effect on Fas expression at concentrations that increased Fas-induced apoptosis (Fig.5), indicating that other mechanisms are involved in the inhibitory effects of NOS. Because NOS did not affect Fas expression levels, we began to map the step(s) in the Fas signaling pathway that might be inhibited by NOS. Members of the caspase family of cysteine proteases are activated by Fas ligation and cleave PARP to its signature 85-kDa fragment (4Nagata S. Cell. 1997; 88: 355-365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4561) Google Scholar, 42Schlegel J. Peters I. Orrenius S. Miller D.K. Thornberry N.A. Yamin T.T. Nicholson D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1841-1844Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). Caspase activation can be monitored by analyzing the extent of PARP cleavage in cells. To determine whether caspase activation is inhibited by NOS, 10C9 or H9 cells were grown in the presence or the absence of Fas agonist antibody and l-NMA, and at various time intervals the extent of PARP cleavage was assessed by Western blot analysis using an anti-PARP polyclonal antibody. NOS inhibition resulted in increased levels of Fas-induced PARP cleavage (Fig.6), suggesting that NOS inhibits caspase activation. Our results indicate that NOS inhibits Fas-induced apoptosis in human B cell, T cell, and monocytic cell lines via a cGMP-independent mechanism. NOS appears to inhibit Fas-induced caspase activation and PARP cleavage without altering levels of Fas expression. Although studies have shown that NO or related molecules can exert either pro- or anti-apoptotic effects depending on the cell type and stimulus (39Mannick J.B. Asano K. Izumi K. Kieff E.

Invest. 1995; 95: 1884-1890Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar), the emerging picture is one where the predominant physiologic effect of NOS is inhibition of apoptosis. For instance, NO inhibits apoptosis in murine splenic B cells, human B cell lines, rat ovarian follicles, and human eosinophils (39Mannick J.B. Asano K. Izumi K. Kieff E. Stamler J.S. Cell. 1994; 79: 1137-1146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar, 47Chun S.Y. Eisenhauer K.M. Kubo M. Hsueh A.J.W.

The cellular factors and target proteins that are responsible for the specificity of NO-related effects on apoptosis remain to be determined. The cGMP-independent actions of NOS (such as inhibition of Fas-induced apoptosis in human leukocytes) appear to occur throughS-nitrosylation of proteins or modulation of redox state. Both mechanisms may operate to inhibit Fas signaling. Specifically, several studies show a role for oxidative stress in Fas-induced apoptosis (50van den Dobbelsteen D.J. Nobel C.S.I. Schlegel J.

Immunol. 1996; 26: 1164-1169Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). In addition, NO inhibits many enzymes, including cysteine proteases, by S-nitrosylation of active site thiols (53Stamler J.S. Simon D.I. Osborne J.A. Mullins M.E. Jaraki O. Michel T. Singel D.J. Loscalzo J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 444-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (1311) Google Scholar, 54Stamler J.S.

S-Nitrosylation of the caspase family of cysteine proteases is suggested by our finding that NOS decreases PARP cleavage. The observation that NOS inhibits Fas-induced apoptosis may explain a previously described association between NO and Fas in studies of the MRL lpr/lpr mouse. The MRL lpr/lpr mouse carries a spontaneous Fas mutation that impairs Fas transcription (6Watanabe-Fukunaga R. Brannan C.I. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Nagata S. Nature. 1992; 356: 314-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (2737) Google Scholar, 55Adachi M. Watanabe Fukunaga R. Nagata S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1756-1760Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). These mice develop arthritis and nephritis, presumably as a result of impaired Fas-mediated apoptosis of autoreactive lymphocytes. However, other strains of mice carrying the same Fas mutation do not develop autoimmune disease, suggesting that additional factors are involved in the phenotype (56Izui S. Kelley V.E. Masuda K. Yoshida H. Roths J.B. Murphy E.D. J. Immunol. 1984; 133: 227-233PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, NOS expression and activity are increased in MRL lpr/lpr mice but not in B6lpr/lpr mice (who do not develop arthritis and glomerulonephritis); the glomerulonephritis and arthritis can be reduced in MRL lpr/lpr mice using NOS inhibitors (57Weinberg J.B. Granger D.L. Pisetsky D.S. Seldin M.F. Misukonis M.A. Mason S.N. Pippen A.M. Ruiz P. Wood E.R. Gilkeson G.S. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 179: 651-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which NOS induces glomerulonephritis and arthritis in these mice has not been elucidated. Our data raise the possibility that NO production may unmask the lpr phenotype by inhibiting already low levels of Fas-mediated apoptosis of autoreactive lymphocytes. Likewise, failure of cells to undergo apoptosis is a factor contributing to the development of some forms of cancer (1Thompson C.B. Science. 1995; 267: 1456-1462Crossref PubMed Scopus (6205) Google Scholar). Resistance to Fas-mediated apoptosis may contribute to the pathogenesis of lymphomas because many primary lymphoid neoplasms express Fas (58Kondo E. Yoshino T. Yamadori I. Matsuo Y. Kawasaki N. Minowada J. Akagi T. Am. J. Pathol. 1994; 145: 330-337PubMed Google Scholar) without undergoing apoptosis. Elevated levels of NO-related species may contribute to Fas resistance in some of these tumors. In support of this hypothesis, HIV-1-infected patients have a markedly increased incidence of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (59Pluda J.M. Yarchoan R. Jaffe E.S. Feuerstein I.M. Solomon D. Steinberg S.M.

Dalla-Favera R. Blood. 1991; 77: 1092-1095Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and elevated levels of nitrates and nitrites (the stable end products of NO synthesis) in their blood (61Torre D. Ferrario G. Bonetta G. Speranza F. Zeroli C. AIDS. 1995; 9: 979-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 62Evans T.G. Rasmussen K. Wiebke G. Hibbs Jr., J.B. Clin. Exp.

Thus, elevated NO production may inhibit apoptotic death of lymphoma cells in AIDS patients, thereby contributing to lymphomagenesis. NO-based therapies may be useful in the treatment of these malignancies and other Fas-associated diseases."

BAD is phosphorylated on serine residues in response to a survival factor, interleukin-3. Phosphorylated BAD cannot bind to BCL-XL or BCL-2 at membrane sites and is found in the cytosol bound to 14-3-3. We report here that deletion mapping and site-directed mutagenesis identified a BH3 domain within BAD that proved necessary for both its heterodimerization with BCL-XL and its death agonist activity. Substitution of the conserved Leu151 with Ala in the BH3 amphipathic α-helix abrogated both functions. The BAD Leu151 mutant was predominantly in the cytosol bound to 14-3-3. The BH3 domain of BCL-2 also proved important for BCL-2/BAD interaction.

These results establish a critical role for a BH3 domain within BAD and provide evidence that BAD may function as a death ligand whose pro-apoptotic activity requires heterodimerization with BCL-XL. The BCL-2 family of proteins comprised of anti and pro-apoptotic molecules constitutes a critical, intracellular decision point within a common cell death pathway (1Farrow S.N. Brown R. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1996; 6: 45-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). The ratio of antagonist (BCL-2, BCL-XL, MCL-1, and A1) to agonist (BAX, BAK, BCL-XS, and BAD) molecules dictates whether a cell will respond to a proximal apoptotic stimulus (1Farrow S.N. Brown R. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1996; 6: 45-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar, 2Oltvai Z.N. Milliman C.L. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1993; 74: 609-619Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5823) Google Scholar). Membership in the family was first defined by homology in two conserved regions, the BH1 and BH2 domains. Mutational analysis of BCL-2 identified key residues within BH1 and BH2 domains required for both heterodimerization with BAX and repression of cell death (3Yin X.-M. Oltvai Z.N. Korsmeyer S.J. Nature. 1994; 369: 321-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (1212) Google Scholar). However, other BCL-XLmutants lost heterodimerization with BAX but still retained some death repressor activity, suggesting that these two functions were separable (4Cheng E.H. Levine B. Boise L.H. Thompson C.B. Hardwick J.M. Nature. 1996; 379: 554-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). An additional domain, BH3, had also been noted in BCL-2 proteins and proved essential for the pro-apoptotic function of BAK (5Chittenden T. Flemington C. Houghton A.B. Ebb R.G. Gallo G.J.

Moreover, the death-promoting molecules BIK and BID possess only a BH3 domain without identifiable BH1 and BH2 domains, arguing for the importance of BH3 in death agonists (8Boyd J.M. Gallo G.J. Elangovan B. Houghton A.B. Malstrom S. Avery B.J. Ebb R.G. Subramanian T. Chittenden T. Luta R.J. Chinnadurai G. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 1921-1928PubMed Google Scholar, 9Han J. Sabbatini P. White E. Mol.

Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2859-2869Crossref PubMed Scopus (801) Google Scholar). BAD, initially identified by its interaction with BCL-2 and BCL-XL, is a distant BCL-2 family member, bears only the most universally conserved amino acids within BH1 and BH2 domains, and lacks the typical hydrophobic C-terminal signal-anchor. The presence of BAD counters the anti-apoptotic effect of BCL-XL or BCL-2 perhaps by directly inhibiting them or by displacing the pro-apoptotic BAX molecule (11Yang E. Zha J. Jockel J. Boise L.H. Thompson C.B. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 285-291Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1879) Google Scholar). BAD represents a bridging molecule interconnecting signal transduction pathways from extracellular survival factors with the BCL-2 intracellular checkpoint on cell death. BAD is phosphorylated on two serine residues embedded in canonical 14-3-3 binding sites in response to a survival factor, IL-3. 1The abbreviations used are: IL, interleukin; Wt, wild type; Ab, antibody; mAb, monoclonal antibody; GST, glutathioneS-transferase.1The abbreviations used are: IL, interleukin; Wt, wild type; Ab, antibody; mAb, monoclonal antibody; GST, glutathioneS-transferase. Phosphorylated BAD does not bind BCL-XL and is sequestered in the cytosol bound to 14-3-3, a specific phosphoserine-binding protein. Substitution of the serine phosphorylation sites indicated that phosphorylation of BAD inactivated the molecule to promote cell survival (12Zha J. Harada H. Yang E. Jockel J. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1996; 87: 619-628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2233) Google Scholar). In the present study, we utilize deletion mapping and site-directed mutagenesis to define a BH3 domain in BAD required for heterodimerization with BCL-XL and its pro-apoptotic activity. Substitution of the conserved Leu151 in this predicted amphipathic α-helical BH3 domain abrogated both functions. Standard polymerase chain reactions were used to amplify DNA. The BadDNA fragments (141–204, 152–204, 163–204, 173–204, 141–172, 141–183, and 141–194) with engineered HindIII andEcoRI sites were cloned in frame into pET17b. Thebad DNA fragments (full-length, 1–181, 1–141, 127–204, and full-length with a deletion from 142 to 165) with engineeredBamHI and EcoRI sites were cloned into pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) downstream of T7 and cytomegalovirus promoters. The site-directed mutagenesis of bad and bcl-2(BADG148A, BADR149A, BADL151A, and BCL-2L97A) was performed in pGEM-3Z derivatives using a QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The sequence confirmed mutant DNA was subcloned into the pSSFV expression vector. Total cell lysates were prepared from BL21 cells (Novagen), which contained a pET17b vector with BAD deletion constructs fused in frame with T7 gene 10 following induction with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (0.1 mm) for 1 h. Lysates (40 μg) were size fractionated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane has hybridized with32P-labeled GST-BCL-2 according to the protocol of Blanar and Rutter (13Blanar M.A. Rutter W.J. Science. 1992; 256: 1014-1018Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Wt and mutant BAD and BCL-2 proteins were generated by anin vitro transcription-translation system (Promega).In vitro binding assays were performed as described previously (12Zha J. Harada H. Yang E.

Stable transfectants were generated in FL5.12 BCL-XL cells as described previously (12Zha J. Harada H. Yang E. Jockel J. Korsmeyer S.J.

Transient transfections were performed in BAD-deficient murine embryonic fibroblasts with pcDNA3-derived constructs. The luciferase reporter plasmid (0.1 mg) was mixed with 0.05 mg of various constructs and 3 ml of lipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) in a volume of 0.5 ml added to murine embryonic fibroblast cells for 5 h. Cells were lysed 18–20 h later, and luciferase assays were performed using a standard substrate (Promega). Luciferase activities were quantified by a luminometer (OptocompII, MGM Instruments Inc.). An assessment of cell viability was displayed as the relative luciferase activity of a test construct compared with the control pcDNA3 plasmid (10Wang K. Yin X.-M. Chao D.T. Milliman C.L. Korsmeyer S.J. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2859-2869Crossref PubMed Scopus (801) Google Scholar). The viability of FL5.12 cells was measured by propidium iodine exclusion. FL5.12 BCL-XL/BAD cells were fractionated to separate cytosol from crude membrane as described previously (12Zha J. Harada H. Yang E. Jockel J. Korsmeyer S.J.

BCL-XL Abs include a rabbit polyclonal Ab (13.6) and a murine mAb (7B2) against human BCL-XL (14Boise L.H. Minn A.J. Noel P.J. June C.H. Accavitti M.A. Lindsten T. Thompson C.B. Immunity. 1995; 3: 87-98Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1070) Google Scholar). The anti-14-3-3 Ab was from Upstate Biotechnology Inc. BH3 domain of BAD is required for cell death, and heterodimerization-BCL-2 interaction cloning had identified three independent clones of Bad, the smallest encoding only residues 141–204, the C terminus (11Yang E. Zha J. Jockel J. Boise L.H. Thompson C.B. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 285-291Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1879) Google Scholar). To define the minimal region in BAD essential for its interaction with BCL-2, we generated a nested set of deletion mutants (Fig. 1 A). These mutant BAD proteins were expressed in vitro and tested for their ability to interact with BCL-2 protein. Removal of an additional 12 amino acids (BAD construct 152–204) abrogated binding to BCL-2 (Fig. 1 B), whereas deletion of 32 amino acids from the C terminus (BAD 141–172) still bound BCL-2. Therefore, a small 31-amino acid region (141–172) is both sufficient and essential for BAD to heterodimerize with BCL-2. This includes a sequence (151–159) with homology to BH3 domains found in other pro-apoptotic molecules (Fig. 2 A). The BH3 domain of BAD is predicted to be an amphipathic α-helix (Fig.2 B).Figure 2Primary sequence homology and predicted structure of BAD BH3 domain. A, sequence homology within BH3 domains of human BAK (hBAK), human BIK(hBIK), murine BID (mBID), murineBAX (mBAX), and murine BAD(mBAD). The identical amino acids shared with BAD areboxed. The YGR minimal homology to BH1 found in BAD is noted. B, views of the hydrophobic surface (left) and polar surface (right) of the BH3 amphipathic α-helix of BAD (151–163) were calculated and displayed using GRASP (18Nicholls A. Sharp K.A. Honig B. Protein Struct. Funct. Genet. 1991; 11: 281-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (5311) Google Scholar). The surface is colored deep blue (23kBT) in the most positively charged regions and deep red(−21kBT) in the most negative, with linear interpolation for values in between. This model was generated using the protein building module (BUILDER) of INSIGHTII (Biosym, San Diego) and minimized using DISCOVER, the force field simulation module.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) A transient transfection assay was used to assess the role of various regions of BAD in promoting apoptosis. A large N-terminal deletion mutant (127–204) with an intact BH1/BH3 region and a small C-terminal deletion mutant that removed the BH2 domain (1–181) were nearly as effective as Wt BAD in promoting cell death (Fig.3). In contrast, deletion of the BH1/BH3 region (deletion of amino acids 142–165) diminished death-promoting function substantially. This same construct (BAD Δ142–165) also failed to bind BCL-2 or BCL-XL (Fig. 3 B and data not shown). Thus, the BH1/BH3 region (142–165) is required for both heterodimerization and death agonist activity. To further dissect this BH1/BH3 region we used site-directed mutagenesis to substitute individual amino acids (143–153) and assess the effect of their substitution. Of note, the greatest impact was not from substitutions in the region homologous to BH1 as had been noted for BCL-2 and BCL-XL (4Cheng E.H. Levine B. Boise L.H. Thompson C.B. Hardwick J.M.

Instead, replacement of Leu151 of the BH3 domain with alanine (L151A) reduced the binding of mutant BAD with either BCL-2 or BCL-XL by more than 90%. In contrast, BAD G148A binding with BCL-2 was reduced approximately 50%, whereas its interaction with BCL-XL was only minimally affected (Fig.4 A). We also assessed the domains in BCL-2 most involved in heterodimerization with BAD. An in vitro binding assay revealed that GST-BAD still interacts with slightly reduced efficiency to the BH1 mutant mI-3 (G145A) and weakly to the BH2 mutant mII-1 (W188A) but not at all to the BCL-2 BH3 mutant (L97A) (Fig.5). Thus, BH3 plays a prominent role in heterodimerization for both the death agonist and antagonist. To assess the death-promoting action of the BAD point mutants, we stably expressed them in the hematopoietic cell line FL5.12 BCL-XL. Clones with similar levels of Wt and mutant BAD as well as BCL-XL were identified (Fig. 4 B) and tested for viability after IL-3 withdrawal. Mutants of BAD G148A and BAD R149A within the BH1-like region like Wt BAD reversed the protective effect of BCL-XL; however, a BH3 mutant BAD L151A could no longer promote cell death (Fig.6 C). The 7B2 anti-BCL-XL mAb co-precipitated the Wt BAD, BAD G148A, and somewhat less efficiently BAD R149A, but failed to co-precipitate substantial amounts of BAD L151A with BCL-XL (Fig.4 C). Consistent with this, a markedly increased amount of BAD L151A was present in the supernatant of this immunoprecipitate. This provides in vivo confirmation (Fig. 4 C) for the loss of BAD L151A binding to BCL-XL noted in vitro (Fig. 4 A). Because intracellular localization of BAD is associated with its functional activity (12Zha J. Harada H. Yang E. Jockel J. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1996; 87: 619-628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2233) Google Scholar), we tested whether BAD L151A had also altered its subcellular distribution. The majority of BAD L151A was present in the cytosolic fraction with a more prominent upper band (Fig.6 A, lane Cyt, L151A), which represents the hyperphosphorylated form of BAD. Furthermore, anti-BAD mAb 2G11 co-precipitated significantly more 14-3-3 protein associated with BAD L151A than with Wt BAD or the other mutants (Fig. 6 B). These data indicate that BAD L151A that is incapable of binding to BCL-XL is also functionally inactive and localized to the cytosol where it is bound to 14-3-3. A combination of deletion mapping and site-specific mutagenesis identified a BH3 domain in BAD as critical for both its heterodimerization with BCL-2 or BCL-XL and its death-promoting activity. The short BH3 motif LRRMSDEFE proved most similar to BAX (Fig. 2 A). Molecular modeling of the BH3 domain of BAD revealed a classic amphipathic α-helix in which the critical Leu151 resides on the hydrophobic face (Fig.2 B). The close proximity of the BH3 motif of BAD to the previously noted BH1-like YGR core residues is somewhat unusual (Fig.2 A), and these YGR residues may reside within the same α-helix. Of note, BAK contains VGR residues in the N terminus of its amphipathic α2-helix proximal to the highly conserved BH3 motif (Fig.2 A). A mutant BAK R76A peptide demonstrated decreased binding to BCL-XL (17Sattler M. Liang H. Nettheim D. Meadows R.P. Harlan J.E. Eberstadt M. Yoon H.S. Shuker S.B. Chang B.S. Minn A.J. Thompson C.B. Fesik S.N. Science. 1997; 275: 983-986Crossref PubMed Scopus (1278) Google Scholar). This also suggests that the BAD structure will vary from the BCL-XL hydrophobic pocket generated by BH1, BH2, and BH3 (15Muchmore S.W. Sattler M. Liang H. Meadows R.P. Harlan J.E. Yoon H.S. Netteshelm D. Chang B.S. Thompson C.B. Wong S.-L. Ng S.-C. Fesik S.W. Nature. 1996; 381: 335-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (1277) Google Scholar). Of note substitution of Gly149 of BAD affected its binding to BCL-2 much more than to BCL-XL indicating a difference in the contact sites of these anti-apoptotic molecules. These data for BAD coincide with a growing body of evidence that implicates BH3 domains in pro-apoptotic molecules. The BH3 region of BAX and BAK are necessary for binding to BCL-XL and promoting apoptosis (5Chittenden T. Flemington C. Houghton A.B. Ebb R.G. Gallo G.J. Elangovan B. Chinnadurai G. Lutz R.J.

A detailed NMR analysis of wild type and mutant peptides of the BH3 amphipathic α2-helix of BAK indicated critical interactions with BCL-XL through both hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions (17Sattler M. Liang H. Nettheim D. Meadows R.P. Harlan J.E. Eberstadt M. Yoon H.S. Shuker S.B. Chang B.S. Minn A.J. Thompson C.B. Fesik S.N. Science. 1997; 275: 983-986Crossref PubMed Scopus (1278) Google Scholar). Moreover, the death agonists BIK and BID possess only the BH3 region, arguing that it represents the minimal death domain (8Boyd J.M. Gallo G.J. Elangovan B. Houghton A.B. Malstrom S. Avery B.J.

One model of BAD regulation holds that phosphorylated BAD would be inactive sequestered in the cytosol by 14-3-3, whereas nonphosphorylated BAD would be the active form bound to BCL-XL inhibiting it and/or releasing pro-apoptotic BAX (12Zha J. Harada H. Yang E. Jockel J. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1996; 87: 619-628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2233) Google Scholar). However, this prior study of BAD phosphorylation did not address another model in which unbound, free BAD might serve as an active death agonist. The current data disfavor this model in that the minimal L151A point mutation of BH3 indicates that a BAD molecule that is unable to bind BCL-XL or BCL-2 is heavily phosphorylated, bound to 14-3-3 in the cytosol, and functionally inactive. The prominence of the BH3 domain for BAD function combined with only minimal conservation of BH1 and BH2 motifs argue that BAD is more closely related to BID and BIK. Like BID, BAD lacks the C-terminal signal anchor sequence and may represent a death ligand that inhibits the membrane receptors BCL-2 and BCL-XL."

If left unrepaired, they lead to broken chromosomes and cell death. If repaired improperly, they can lead to chromosome translocations and cancer. Humans are at risk for DSBs from exogenous agents. The paradigm agent, ionizing radiation, is present in the environment mainly from the decay of radon gas, which accumulates in homes to different levels depending on the uranium content of the underlying soil. Ionizing radiation is also utilized in medicine for diagnostic x-rays and for treating cancer patients. Anticancer drugs will generate DSBs as well: bleomycin produces oxidative free radicals, which induce strand breaks; etoposide and adriamycin inhibit topoisomerase II to create protein-bridged DSBs. Humans are also at risk for DSBs from endogenous agents. Oxidative metabolism generates free radicals and subsequent strand breaks. V(D)J recombination generates DSBs during rearrangement of genes encoding B cell immunoglobulins and T cell receptors (2Smider V. Chu G. Semin. Immunol. 1997; 9: 189-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In response to the threat of DSBs, cells have evolved at least two independent pathways for repairing DSBs, by homologous recombination or by nonhomologous DNA end joining. This review will focus on recent progress in understanding the dominant mechanism in mammalian cells, nonhomologous end joining. Immunological diversity is generated by V(D)J recombination (Fig.1), a site-specific cleavage of the chromosome followed by an end-joining reaction to bring the free DNA ends together (2Smider V. Chu G. Semin. Immunol. 1997; 9: 189-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The possibility that DSB repair and V(D)J recombination might share the same biochemical pathway was first recognized in the severe combined immunodeficiency (scid) mouse. The scid mouse lacks mature B and T cells due to a defect in V(D)J recombination (3Lieber M.R. Hesse J.E. Lewis S. Bosma G.C. Rosenberg N. Mizuuchi K. Bosma M.J. Gellert M. Cell. 1988; 55: 7-16Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar) and is also hypersensitive to ionizing radiation due to a defect in DSB repair (4Biedermann K. Sun J. Giaccia A.

Screening of other x-ray-sensitive cell lines (TableI) led to the identification of three genetic complementation groups with defects in both DSB repair and V(D)J recombination (7Pergola F.

Since efforts were under way to complement these rodent cell lines with human genes, the genes for the complementation groups were designated XRCC, for x-ray cross-complementing. XRCC7 mutant cells (scidmouse cells and V3 hamster cells) were severely defective in coding joint formation but only mildly defective in signal joint formation.

Open table in a new tab Genetic complementation groups, corresponding to the x-ray cross-complementing genes, XRCC4–XRCC7, have been assigned for cell lines hypersensitive to ionizing radiation and defective in V(D)J recombination. The XRCC6 mutant cell line was generated by targeted knockout of mouse embryonic stem cells. a.a., amino acid. The path toward isolating the XRCC5 andXRCC7 genes began with identification of the Ku protein as an autoantigen in scleroderma-polymyositis overlap syndrome (9Mimori T. Akizuki M. Yamagata H. Inada S. Yoshida S. Homma M. J. Clin. Invest. 1981; 68: 611-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar, 10Reeves W. Rheum. Dis. Clin. North Am. 1992; 18: 391-415PubMed Google Scholar). In the hope of gaining insight into the pathogenesis of autoimmune disease, Ku was extensively characterized. Ku is a heterodimer of 70 and 86 kDa (Ku70 and Ku86) that binds with strong affinity to DNA ends, stem-loop or bubble structures, or transitions between double-stranded DNA and two single strands (11Mimori T. Hardin J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 10375-10379Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,12Falzon M. Fewell J.W. Kuff E.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10546-10552Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Once Ku binds to DNA, it can translocate along the DNA, so that three or more Ku molecules can bind to a single linear DNA fragment (13de Vries E. van Driel W. Bergsma W.G. Arnberg A.C. van der Vliet P.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 208: 65-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 14Paillard S. Strauss F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 5619-5624Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). If the linear DNA is then ligated into a circle, Ku can no longer dissociate, consistent with a model in which Ku molecules bind to DNA like beads on a string. Ku is a DNA-dependent ATPase that is activated by both double- and single-stranded DNA (15Cao Q. Pitt S. Leszyk J. Baril E. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 8548-8557Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Both Ku70 and Ku86 contain motifs for potential ATP binding sites. Ku has also been reported to have an ATP-dependent 3′ to 5′ helicase activity (16Tuteja N. Tuteja R. Ochem A. Taneja P. Huang N. Simoncsits A. Susic S. Rahman K. Marusic L. Chen J. Zhang J. Wang S. Pongor S. Falaschi A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4991-5001Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Ku is the regulatory subunit for DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK), which has the unusual property of remaining quiescent until activated by DNA ends (17Gottlieb T. Jackson S. Cell. 1993; 72: 131-142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1011) Google Scholar). DNA-PK contains an enormous catalytic subunit of 465 kDa (DNA-PKcs) that is activated when Ku binds to DNA. DNA-PK will phosphorylate serine or threonine residues that immediately precede glutamine in a large number of protein substrates in vitro (18Anderson C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 433-437Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Interestingly, DNA-PK will phosphorylate Ku in vitro, activating its ATPase activity (15Cao Q. Pitt S. Leszyk J. Baril E. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 8548-8557Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). However, attempts to identify in vivo substrates have been inconclusive. For example, DNA-PK will phosphorylate p53 in vitro but is not required for the accumulation or activation of p53 (19Fried L.M. Koumenis C. Peterson S.R. Green S.L. van Zijl P. Allalunis-Turner J. Chen D.C. Fishel R. Giaccia A.J. Brown J.M. Kirchgessner C.U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13825-13830Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 20Rathmell W.K. Kaufmann W.K. Hurt J.C.

Biol. 1994; 14: 4741-4748Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). This assay was used to screen a large number of x-ray-sensitive cell lines, and DEB factor was absent in three different cell lines, all belonging to the complementation group forXRCC5 (21Rathmell W.K. Chu G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4741-4748Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). DEB factor proved to be both biochemically and antigenically similar to Ku (22Rathmell W.K. Chu G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7623-7627Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 23Getts R. Stamato T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15981-15984Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, the XRCC5and Ku86 genes were independently mapped to the same human chromosome locus, 2q33-35 (24Chen D.J. Marrone B.L. Nguyen T. Stackhouse M. Zhao Y. Siciliano M.J. Genomics. 1994; 21: 423-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 25Hafezparast M. Kaur G. Zdzienicka M. Athwal R. Lehmann A. Jeggo P. Somatic Cell Mol.

Cell Genet. 1994; 65: 221-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). To demonstrate that Ku86 and XRCC5 are identical, an expression vector for Ku86 was transfected into the mutantXRCC5 hamster cells. Transfection of human Ku86rescued the mutant hamster cells for DEB activity, DNA-PK enzymatic activity, x-ray resistance, and V(D)J recombination (27Taccioli G. Gottlieb T. Blunt T. Priestly A. Demengeot J. Mizuta R. Lehmann A. Alt F. Jackson S. Jeggo P. Science. 1994; 265: 1442-1445Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar, 28Smider V. Rathmell W.K. Lieber M. Chu G. Science. 1994; 266: 288-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). Transfection of Ku86 also restored resistance to the topoisomerase II inhibitor etoposide (29He D.M. Lee S.E. Hendrickson E.A. Mutat. Res. 1996; 363: 43-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Thus Ku is involved in the repair of DNA DSBs produced by ionizing radiation, V(D)J recombination, or etoposide. XRCC5 cells were found to contain mutations in theKu86 gene (30Errami A. Smider V. Rathmell W.K. He D. Hendrickson E.A. Zdzienicka M. Chu G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1519-1526Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 31Singleton B. Priestly A. Steingrimsdottir H. Gell D. Blunt T. Jackson S. Lehmann A. Jeggo P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1264-1273Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), leading to functionally significant alterations in Ku86 (Table I). As expected, the generation of Ku86 knockout mice produced severe immunodeficiency due to an absence of both T and B cells (32Nussenzweig A. Chen C. da Costa Soares V. Sanchez M. Nussenzweig M. Li G. Nature. 1996; 382: 551-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar,33Zhu C. Bogue M. Lim D.S. Hasty P. Roth D. Cell. 1996; 86: 379-389Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). Both coding and signal joint formation were impaired, and the coding joint defect was accompanied by accumulation of hairpin coding ends in Ku86 knockout thymocytes. Unexpectedly, theKu86 knockout mice also displayed marked growth retardation (32Nussenzweig A. Chen C. da Costa Soares V. Sanchez M. Nussenzweig M. Li G. Nature. 1996; 382: 551-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar), suggesting that Ku might have an additional unforseen role. The discovery that Ku86 was defective in XRCC5mutant cells raised the possibility that DNA-PKcs might be defective in XRCC7 cells (34Blunt T. Finnie N. Taccioli G. Smith G. Demengeot J. Gottlieb T. Mizuta R. Varghese A. Alt F. Jeggo P. Jackson S. Cell. 1995; 80: 813-823Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (773) Google Scholar, 35Kirchgessner C. Patil C. Evans J. Cuomo C. Fried L. Carter T.

A. 1995; 92: 3171-3174Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Indeed, DNA-PK enzymatic activity and DNA-PKcs protein levels were severely reduced in both scid and V3 cells. When genomic yACs containing theDNA-PK cs gene were transfected intoscid and V3 cells, DNA-PK enzymatic activity, ionizing radiation resistance, and coding joint formation were restored. Furthermore, the DNA-PK cs gene was mutated inscid cells, producing a premature termination codon in the putative kinase domain that truncates the C-terminal 83 amino acids (37Blunt T. Gell D. Fox M. Taccioli G. Jackson S. Lehman A. Jeggo P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10285-10290Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar, 38Danska J. Holland D. Mariathasan S. Williams K. Guidos C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 10: 6472-6481Google Scholar). As in Ku86 knockout thymocytes, scid thymocytes accumulate hairpin coding ends (33Zhu C. Bogue M. Lim D.S. Hasty P. Roth D. Cell. 1996; 86: 379-389Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). Therefore, Ku and DNA-PK are required for the proper processing of hairpin ends. Ku or DNA-PK do not have an endonuclease activity that opens the hairpin ends directly. Instead, DNA-PK enzymatic activity may make the hairpin accessible to a still unidentified hairpin endonuclease. The only known XRCC4 cell line, XR-1, is rescued by transfection of a cDNA encoding a 37-kDa protein, restoring both ionizing radiation resistance and V(D)J recombination to wild-type levels (39Li Z. Otevrel T. Gao Y. Cheng H.-L. Seed B. Stamato T.D. Taccioli G.E. Alt F.W. Cell. 1995; 83: 1079-1089Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). XRCC4 is a novel gene, lacking homology to other known genes. It is deleted in XR-1 cells and therefore not essential for growth. The sensitivity of XR-1 cells increases dramatically in the G1 phase of the cell cycle (40Giaccia A. Weinstein R. Hu J. Stamato T.D. Somatic Cell Mol. Genet. 1985; 11: 485-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), and any proposed role for XRCC4 must account for this phenomenon. End joining of naked DNA has been studied by introducing linear DNA into intact cells. When linearized plasmid DNA was injected intoXenopus oocytes, a low level of plasmid recircularization occurred (41Grzesiuk E. Carroll D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 971-985Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The end-joining reaction resulted in junctions containing deletions back to regions of microhomology of 1–10 bases within 20 bp of the ends. When linearized SV40 DNA was transfected into mammalian cells, end joining either occurred by direct joining of the ends or by the deletions back to regions of microhomology of 1–6 bases (42Roth D.B. Porter T.N. Wilson J.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 2599-2607Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 43Roth D.B. Wilson J.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 4295-4304Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). Direct joining occurred even for ends with protruding ends of opposite polarity (5′ protruding and 3′ protruding). The joining events utilizing microhomology were proposed to be directed by base pairing of the microhomology regions (Fig. 2), thus aligning the DNA ends for subsequent steps in the end-joining reaction. Interestingly, end joining also occurred occasionally with the insertion of nucleotides from a number of sources, including free oligonucleotides in the nucleus, copying errors near the DSB by slipped mispairing and repair synthesis, and misincorporation of A residues during repair of a 5′ single-stranded extension (44Roth D.B. Chang X. Wilson J.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 3049-3057Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). To study end joining of chromosomal DNA, restriction enzymes have been used to introduce DSBs at specific chromosomal sites. Restriction enzymes were electroporated into Chinese hamster ovary cells, which are hemizygous at the APRT (adenine phosphoribosyltransferase) locus (45Phillips J. Morgan W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5794-5803Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Colonies of viable cells containing mutations inAPRT were then analyzed at the DNA sequence level. Mutations consisted of insertions, small deletions up to 36 bp, and combinations of insertions and deletions at the cleavage sites. Most of the deletions involved the utilization of microhomology of 1–4 bases at the recombination junctions. Because this method scored for induced mutations in APRT, the full spectrum of end-joining events could not be observed. Nevertheless, the end-joining reactions observed with transfected naked DNA and chromosomal DNA shared key characteristics: nucleotide insertions and nucleotide deletions directed by microhomology. Rare cutting restriction enzymes have been used to introduce a single or very few DSBs into the mammalian genome (46Liang F. Romanienko P. Weaver D. Jeggo P. Jasin M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8929-8933Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Chinese hamster ovary cells were engineered to contain a single I-SceI site disrupting an integrated neo gene. Repair of the induced DSB reconstructed an intact neo gene if the end joining occurred with deletion of the ends back to a region of 4-base microhomology. In this system, XRCC5 mutant cells were severely defective in rejoining the DSB by at least 3 orders of magnitude compared with wild-type hamster cells. V(D)J recombination junctions provide additional insight into end joining of broken chromosomes (2Smider V. Chu G. Semin. Immunol. 1997; 9: 189-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Coding joint formation occurs with both insertion and deletion of nucleotides. Many insertions occur by mechanisms specific for lymphoid cells. Palindromic (P-nucleotide) insertions are generated by the asymmetric cleavage of the hairpin coding ends. Nontemplated (N-nucleotide) insertions are catalyzed by lymphoid-specific terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase (TdT). However, nucleotide insertion will still occur in TdT knockout mice (47Gilfillan S. Dierich A. Lemeur M. Benoist C. Mathis D. Science. 1993; 261: 1175-1178Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). Nucleotide deletion is also best studied in TdT knockout mice, since TdT-catalyzed insertions can obscure the nature of the deletions. In the absence of TdT, 75% of the joining events contain deletions directed by microhomology regions of 1–5 nucleotides (47Gilfillan S. Dierich A. Lemeur M. Benoist C. Mathis D. Science. 1993; 261: 1175-1178Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar, 48Komori T. Okada A. Stewart V. Alt F. Science. 1993; 261: 1171-1175Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). Thus, the joining reaction for coding ends during V(D)J recombination confirms the characteristics observed for random DSBs in nonlymphoid cells. The proposed DNA intermediates for the end-joining reaction are shown in Fig. 3. In contrast to coding joint formation, signal joint formation is precise and depends on Ku but not on an intact kinase domain in DNA-PKcs. Thus, the mechanisms that lead to the insertion and deletion of nucleotides are somehow suppressed during the formation of signal ends. Cells are capable of repairing DSBs either by homologous recombination or by nonhomologous end joining. Genetic screens suggest that the relative importance of these two mechanisms is quite different in yeast and mammalian cells. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, screens for mutants sensitive to ionizing radiation have produced many mutant alleles of genes involved in homologous recombination (49Friedberg E.C. Walker G.C. Siede W. DNA Repair and Mutagenesis. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1995: 555-567Google Scholar), but not genes involved in nonhomologous end joining. Furthermore, yeast knocked out for the genes homologous to mammalian Ku have normal sensitivity to ionizing radiation (50Boulton S. Jackson S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 4639-4648Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar, 51Barnes G. Rio D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 867-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 52Milne G.T. Jin S. Shannon K.B. Weaver D.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4189-4198Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar, 53Siede W. Friedl A. Dianova I. Eckardt-Schupp F. Friedberg E. Genetics. 1996; 142: 91-102Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Nevertheless, yeast Ku is involved in DSB repair. Yeast Ku70 mutants fail to recircularize linearized plasmids (50Boulton S. Jackson S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 4639-4648Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar, 52Milne G.T. Jin S. Shannon K.B. Weaver D.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4189-4198Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). They also fail to survive when induced to express EcoRI, which causes DSBs at the same position in both sister chromatids, precluding repair by homologous recombination (51Barnes G. Rio D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 867-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Furthermore, when homologous recombination is eliminated in a rad52 mutant, disruption of yeastKu70 confers additional radiation hypersensitivity (53Siede W. Friedl A. Dianova I. Eckardt-Schupp F. Friedberg E. Genetics. 1996; 142: 91-102Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, S. cerevisiae repairs DSBs preferentially by homologous recombination, while using Ku-dependent end joining as a secondary pathway when homologous recombination is not possible. By contrast, mutant screens in mammalian cells for sensitivity to ionizing radiation have yielded mutant alleles for Ku andDNA-PK cs but not alleles for genes involved in homologous recombination. When cells are engineered with DNA chromosomal substrates that permit the repair of DSBs by either homologous recombination or by nonhomologous end joining, the great majority of the joining events occurs by nonhomologous end joining (54Godwin A. Bollag R. Christie D. Liskay M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12554-12558Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 55Jeong-yu S. Carroll D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 112-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 56Lukacsovich T. Yang D. Waldman A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 5649-5657Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 57Sargent R. Brenneman M. Wilson J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 267-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Thus, in contrast to yeast, mammalian cells repair DSBs preferentially by nonhomologous end joining. Progress toward defining nonhomologous end joining in a cell-free system has been relatively slow. End joining was studied inXenopus extracts by recircularization of linear DNA molecules with different types of DNA ends (58Thode S. Schafer A. Pfeiffer P. Vielmetter W. Cell. 1990; 60: 921-928Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 59Pfeiffer P. Thode S. Hancke J. Vielmetter W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 888-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). In contrast to results in intact mammalian cells, nucleotide deletion was not observed beyond losses from protruding single strands. Short regions of microhomology were utilized but only if the homologous base pairs were available within the protruding single-stranded regions of the same polarity. Interestingly, substrates with opposite polarities (5′ protruding and 3′ protruding ends) were joined by the alignment of single strands, gap filling, and ligation. Such an unusual activity was found for Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I from Escherichia coli (60King J. Fairly C. Morgan W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20450-20457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), suggesting that a vertebrate polymerase might accomplish the same thing. End joining in mammalian extracts has been studied by the recircularization of pUC18 plasmid DNA cleaved with different restriction enzymes. Almost all events involved direct joining of the cohesive ends, but there were a small number of misrejoined molecules with insertions or deletions utilizing regions of microhomology. By making DSBs with noncohesive ends, it was possible to fractionate extracts into four different end-joining activities (61Johnson A. Fairman M. Mutat. Res. 1996; 364: 103-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The activity that utilized microhomology near the ends could be purified extensively (62Mason R. Thacker J. Fairman M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 4946-4953Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). However, none of the activities was dependent on the presence of Ku protein, suggesting that this cell-free system had detected a secondary end-joining mechanism. There is reason for optimism that Ku-dependent end joining can be studied in cell-free systems for the special case of signal joint formation (63Cortes P. Weis-Garcia F. Misulovin Z. Nussenzweig A. Lai J.-S. Li G. Nussenzweig M.C. Baltimore D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14008-14013Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). When a substrate containing V(D)J recombination signal sequences was incubated with purified RAG1 and RAG2 and HeLa extracts, the substrate was cleaved and the signal ends were joined with appropriate precision. Furthermore, signal joining could be blocked by anti-Ku antibodies. This result, while promising, must be verified with extracts from Ku-deficient cells. The properties of Ku and DNA-PK can be used to formulate a model for how these proteins might facilitate DNA end joining (Fig.4). When the chromosome is broken, Ku protects the DNA ends from degradation until end joining is completed. In support of this, when Ku86 mutant cells were tested for V(D)J recombination, the few signal joining events that were recovered contained large deletions (8Taccioli G. Rathbun G. Oltz E. Stamato T. Jeggo P. Alt F. Science. 1993; 260: 207-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). Similarly, when Ku mutant cells were transfected with linearized plasmid DNA, they exhibited excess degradation of the DNA ends (64Liang F. Jasin M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14405-14411Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Finally, purified Ku protein protected free DNA ends from exonuclease degradation in vitro (23Getts R. Stamato T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15981-15984Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). On binding to the DNA ends, Ku recruits DNA-PKcs. Synapsis of the two DNA ends might be mediated by two independent DNA binding sites on DNA-PK or by the association of two DNA-PK molecules. DNA-PK phosphorylates both DNA-PKcs and Ku subunitsin vitro (65Chan D. Lees-Miller S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8936-8941Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). We hypothesize that this phosphorylation occurs in trans, so that the kinase assembled on one DNA end phosphorylates the DNA-PK subunits assembled on the other DNA end. Activity in trans would regulate the kinase activity so that processing of the DNA ends would occur only after synapsis of the two ends is accomplished. Upon phosphorylation by DNA-PK in vitro, DNA-PKcs dissociates from Ku (65Chan D. Lees-Miller S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8936-8941Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar), and Ku acquires helicase activity (15Cao Q. Pitt S. Leszyk J. Baril E. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 8548-8557Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 16Tuteja N. Tuteja R. Ochem A. Taneja P. Huang N. Simoncsits A. Susic S. Rahman K. Marusic L. Chen J. Zhang J. Wang S. Pongor S. Falaschi A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4991-5001Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). We postulate that this helicase activity unwinds DNA ends in vivo so that exposed regions of microhomology can anneal by base pairing. The unpaired DNA flaps could then be removed either by an exonuclease or a flap endonuclease. A flap endonuclease, FEN-1, has the appropriate enzymatic activity (66Harrington J.J. Lieber M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4503-4508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), although its role in DSB repair and V(D)J recombination has not been established. Gaps are then filled in by a DNA polymerase and the nicks sealed by ligase to complete the end-joining process. The hypothesis that DNA-PK phosphorylates in trans has implications for V(D)J recombination. Recall that the joining of signal ends occurs precisely and does not require intact kinase activity. When a pair of signal and coding ends is created by RAG1/RAG2 cleavage, DNA-PK would assemble on the signal end and phosphorylate Ku bound to the opposing coding end, activating the Ku helicase. The hairpin end would then be processed to allow cleavage by a presumed hairpin endonuclease. The reverse reaction is quite different: DNA-PK assembled on the hairpin end remains inactive as a kinase in vitro. Thus, Ku bound to the signal end would remain unphosphorylated, preventing processing of the signal ends. Therefore, the transphosphorylation hypothesis explains why the joining of signal ends is precise and why it is unaffected by the scidmutation. To test this model, experiments are needed to determine the effect of abrogating Ku helicase activity. Of note, mutation of the conserved ATP binding site in Ku86 has no effect (31Singleton B. Priestly A. Steingrimsdottir H. Gell D. Blunt T. Jackson S. Lehmann A. Jeggo P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1264-1273Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), but a similar experiment has not been performed for the ATP binding site in Ku70. Experiments must also determine whether the helicase activity of Ku will unwind DNA ends and whether Ku is an in vivo substrate for DNA-PK. A knockout of the entire DNA-PKcs gene is needed to determine whether the enormous catalytic subunit has additional biochemical activities. To complete the model, many questions must be answered. What is the role of the XRCC4 protein in the end-joining reaction? What protein has hairpin endonuclease activity? What proteins are required for alignment of the ends by microhomology base pairing? What proteins process the unpaired DNA flaps after alignment? The pathway for nonhomologous DNA end joining has evolved for other roles beyond its primary role in joining broken chromosomes. It has been hypothesized that RAG1 and RAG2 were originally introduced into the mammalian genome by an ancient retroviral infection (67Thompson C.B. Immunity. 1995; 5: 531-539Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (199) Google Scholar). V(D)J recombination could then have evolved by combining the cleavage activity of RAG1/RAG2 with the pre-existing Ku-dependent end-joining activity for broken chromosomes. Such a dual use of end joining is also seen in Drosophila melanogaster, which utilizes Ku for both P-element transposition and DNA repair (68Beall E. Rio D. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 921-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Mammalian cells may have additional roles for Ku. Ku86knockout mice display marked growth retardation (32Nussenzweig A. Chen C. da Costa Soares V. Sanchez M. Nussenzweig M. Li G. Nature. 1996; 382: 551-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar), suggesting a role for Ku other than in DNA repair or V(D)J recombination. Such roles include involvement in transcription by RNA polymerase I (69Hoff C. Ghosh A. Prabhakar B. Jacob S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 762-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 70Kuhn A. Gottlieb T. Jackson S. Grummt I. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 193-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) or RNA polymerase II (12Falzon M. Fewell J.W. Kuff E.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10546-10552Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 71Giffin W. Torrance H. Rodda D. Prefontaine G. Pope L. Hache R. Nature. 1996; 380: 265-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Data from yeast suggest roles in regulating replication and in maintaining telomere length (51Barnes G. Rio D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 867-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). In conclusion, the study of how cells repair double strand breaks has revealed a primordial end-joining mechanism. Further study promises to illuminate not just the repair of broken chromosomes but other critical pathways in DNA metabolism.

https://openalex.org/W2085901921,"Topoisomerase I (TOP1) relaxes superhelical DNA through a breakage/rejoining reaction in which the active site tyrosine links covalently to a 3′ phosphate at the break site as a transient intermediate. The antitumor drug camptothecin (CPT) and its analogs inhibit the rejoining step of the breakage/rejoining reaction, which traps the enzyme in covalent linkage with DNA (the cleavable complex). Little is known about the fate of cellular TOP1 trapped in the cleavable complex. We have analyzed TOP1 in mammalian cell lines treated with CPT. When CPT-treated cells were lysed with either SDS or alkali and analyzed by Western blotting, greater than 90% of the TOP1 was linked to DNA. Nuclease treatment of the cell lysate to remove the covalently linked DNA from TOP1 revealed a distinct ladder of higher molecular weight bands having properties indicative of multi-ubiquitin (Ub) conjugates of TOP1. Approximately 5–10% of TOP1 was present as these conjugates within minutes of CPT treatment. Consistent with ubiquitination, TOP1 was not modified in ts85 cells at the restrictive temperature for its thermolabile ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1). Because conjugation with ubiquitin can mark proteins for destruction by the 26S proteasome, we analyzed TOP1 protein levels during prolonged CPT treatment. TOP1 protein levels were reduced to about 25% during CPT treatments of 2–4 h resulting from increased destruction, with the half-life dropping from 10–16 h down to 1–2 h. The destruction of TOP1, like the formation of Ub-TOP1 conjugates, was not observed in ts85 cells at the restrictive temperature. The destruction of TOP1 was also prevented in cells treated with MG-132 and lactacystin, specific inhibitors of the 26S proteasome. Finally, the multi-Ub conjugates of TOP1 were observed whether or not aphidicolin was included in cotreatment with CPT, indicating that replication fork activity was not involved in making TOP1 a substrate for ubiquitination. These results demonstrate that independent of DNA replication, the TOP1 cleavable complex is ubiquitinated and destroyed in cells treated with antitumor drugs that block the religation step of the TOP1 reaction.

DNA topoisomerase I (TOP1) 1The abbreviations used are: TOP1, topoisomerase I; CPT, camptothecin; Ub, ubiquitin; E1, ubiquitin-activating enzyme; E2, ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme; E3, ubiquitin-ligating enzyme; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; UCRP, ubiquitin cross-reactive protein; Ub2, diubiquitin conjugate.1The abbreviations used are: TOP1, topoisomerase I; CPT, camptothecin; Ub, ubiquitin; E1, ubiquitin-activating enzyme; E2, ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme; E3, ubiquitin-ligating enzyme; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; UCRP, ubiquitin cross-reactive protein; Ub2, diubiquitin conjugate. is a vital DNA metabolic enzyme as well as a molecular target of antitumor drugs. TOP1 relaxes DNA supercoils by cleaving a single strand of duplex DNA and passing the complimentary DNA strand though the cleaved strand before religation (1Wang J.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 665-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (1640) Google Scholar). In a transient reaction intermediate, termed the cleavable complex, the enzyme links covalently to DNA through tyrosine 723 (human TOP1) leaving a DNA break having a free 5′ hydroxyl end. Stopping the TOP1 reaction with strong protein denaturants produces a very low yield of TOP1 linked covalently to DNA. The rarity of this product is a reflection of the transient nature of the “cleaved” reaction intermediate. Antitumor drugs that act on TOP1 inhibit the DNA religation step through a reversible mechanism. The inhibition of religation can be observed as an increase in the yield of the enzyme-DNA covalent complex produced when whole cells or cell-free reactions are rapidly denatured (2Hsiang Y.-H. Hertzberg R. Hecht S. Liu L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 14873-14878Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The TOP1 cleavable complex can block both DNA replication and transcription. In vitro, the reversible TOP1 cleavable complex blocks the progression of transcribing T7 RNA polymerase (3Bendixen C. Thomsen B. Alsner J. Westergaard O. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 5613-5619Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). In cells TOP1 protein and activity localizes to actively transcribed regions of the DNA (4Fleischmann G. Pflugfelder G. Steiner E.K. Javaherian K. Howard G.C. Wang J.C. Elgin S.C.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 6958-6962Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 5Gilmour D.S. Elgin C.R. Mol. Cell.

On the ribosomal gene repeats, the CPT-trapped TOP1 cleavable complex has been shown to cause RNA polymerase I to redistribute to the 5′ end of the gene, suggesting that it acts as a “roadblock” to the traversing RNA polymerase (7Wu R.S. Kumar A. Warner J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1971; 68: 3009-3014Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 8Zhang H. Wang J.C. Liu L.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 1060-1064Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). The TOP1 cleavable complex also causes the replication fork to generate a double-strand DNA break and to arrest, which has been shown both in cell-free systems and in cells (9Ryan A.J. Squires S. Strutt H.L. Evans A. Johnson R.T. Carcinogenesis. 1994; 15: 823-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 10Avemann K. Knippers R. Koller T. Sogo J.M. Mol. Cell.

The interaction of the replication fork with the cleavable complex is the predominant cytotoxic mechanism of CPT as evidenced by the protective effect of DNA synthesis inhibitors against the double-strand break formation as well as the cytotoxicity (9Ryan A.J. Squires S. Strutt H.L. Evans A. Johnson R.T. Carcinogenesis. 1994; 15: 823-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 13Holm C. Covey J.M. Kerrigan D. Pommier Y.

Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 2012-2019PubMed Google Scholar). Although the TOP1 cleavable complex obstructs DNA metabolism, little is known about the molecular mechanisms for managing it. We therefore analyzed TOP1 trapped in the cleavable complex in cells treated with camptothecin. We found the TOP1 cleavable complex multi-Ub conjugated and destroyed by a 26S proteasome-dependent mechanism. Stock cultures of the mouse mammary carcinoma cell line ts85 (temperature-sensitive for ubiquitin-activating enzyme) (16Finley D. Ciechanover A. Varshavsky A. Cell. 1984; 37: 43-55Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar), were maintained in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2at 30 °C in Dulbecco's minimum essential medium containing penicillin-streptomycin and 10% fetal bovine serum. Stock cultures of FM3A, the parental cell line of ts85, and Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHO, line AA8, American Type Culture Collection) were maintained under identical conditions at 37 °C. Cells were shifted to the restrictive temperature by transferring the culture dishes to a 42 °C incubator. Cells were treated with CPT (0.8 to 25 μm, 1% Me2SO) for the indicated times. To analyze Ub-TOP1 conjugates, treated cells were pelleted, chilled on ice, and lysed with ice-cold 0.2 n NaOH, 2 mm EDTA. Cell lysates were sonicated and then neutralized with110volume of 2n HCl.110volume of 10% Nonidet P-40, 1m Tris, pH 7.4, 0.1 m MgCl2, 0.1m CaCl2, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EGTA, and 100 μg/ml of each leupeptin, pepstatin, and aprotinin was then added immediately. Bal31 nuclease (200 units/ml) orStaphylococcus nuclease (10 μg/ml) was added to the neutralized lysates for a 30-min incubation at room temperature where indicated. Reactions were stopped by the addition of SDS-PAGE sample buffer (final concentration, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 15% sucrose, 12 mm EDTA, 3% SDS, 10% β-mercaptoethanol). For analysis of cleavable complexes by the band depletion method, CPT-treated cells were pelleted and lysed immediately with SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Immunoprecipitation of TOP1 was as described (17D'Arpa P. Liu L.F. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 217: 125-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), except nuclei were prepared in the presence of 5 mm N-ethymaleimide for 15 min on ice, followed by the addition of 10 mm cysteine. In some experiments (see Fig.4 B), cell pellets were chilled on ice for 5 min and then lysed with an ice-cold high salt solution (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 0.8 m NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 5 mmMgCl2, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml pepstatin, 5 μg/ml aprotinin) containing 5 mm N-ethymaleimide. This lysate was then diluted with an equal volume of water containing 10 mm cysteine before the addition of13volume of 3 × SDS-PAGE sample buffer. SDS-PAGE was performed with 6% acrylamide gels. Western blotting was performed using TOP1 antisera obtained from scleroderma patients (18Shero J.H. Bordwell B. Rothfield N.F. Earnshaw W.C. Science. 1986; 231: 737-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Detection of primary anibodies was accomplished using125I-protein A (19Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982Google Scholar) and the Bio-Rad Phosphor Imaging System (GS-250) for quantitation of the various topoisomerase forms within their linear ranges of detectability as determined using serial dilutions of cell lysates. Chemiluminescence was also used for detection of primary antibodies (ECL, Amersham Corp.) in conjunction with densitometry (Bio-Rad GS-7000). To analyze TOP1 trapped in the cleavable complex, CHO cells were treated with CPT for various times and then rapidly lysed with SDS. CPT is known to cause TOP1-mediated DNA cleavage and the covalent linkage of TOP1 to the 3′ ends of DNA upon SDS lysis (2Hsiang Y.-H. Hertzberg R. Hecht S. Liu L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 14873-14878Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This covalent TOP1-DNA cleavable product has slower mobility during SDS-PAGE compared with free TOP1 (20Hsiang Y.-H. Liu L.F. Cancer Res. 1988; 48: 1722-1726PubMed Google Scholar). In CHO cells exposed to 25 μm CPT and immediately lysed with SDS, more than 90% of the TOP1 disappeared from its location at 100 kDa on Western blots where it is present as two differently phosphorylated forms (17D'Arpa P. Liu L.F. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 217: 125-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), and it coincidentally reappeared as a higher molecular mass smear (Fig.1). Against the background smear of TOP1 immunoreactivity, a number of distinct bands having a definite periodicity are visible. This ladder pattern of bands was recognized by several different TOP1 antisera (data not shown) that were previously shown to recognize different regions on TOP1 (21D'Arpa P. White-Cooper H. Cleveland D.W. Rothfield N.F. Earnshaw W.C. Arthritis Rheum. 1990; 33: 1501-1511Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). To further analyze the ladder of TOP1-immunoreactive bands, cell lysates were digested with endonucleases to remove the DNA covalently linked to TOP1 prior to SDS-PAGE. After treatment with Staphylococcus or Bal31 nuclease, most of the background smear above TOP1 disappeared; the majority of TOP1 reappeared at 100 kDa; and a ladder of at least six TOP1-immunoreactive bands became more distinct. These bands account for approximately 5–10% of cellular TOP1 (Fig. 1). The periodicity of the bands suggests that TOP1 is modified by multiples of the same molecule, which is reminiscent of multi-Ub conjugation. To analyze the suspected multi-Ub conjugated TOP1, we employed the murine cell line, ts85, which contains a thermolabile ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1) that causes a deficiency in protein ubiquitination at the restrictive temperature (22Deveraux Q. Wells R. Rechsteiner M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6323-6329Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). ts85 and its wild-type parental cell line FM3A were incubated for 90 min at their permissive temperatures, or at 42 °C, the restrictive temperature for ts85. CPT was then added for 10 min at the corresponding temperatures, and cells were immediately lysed with SDS. Under these conditions, the quantity of cleavable complexes formed was about 90% in FM3A and ts85 at both the permissive and restrictive temperatures (measured as the quantity of TOP1 depleted on the Western blot, data not shown). When the lysates were treated withStaphylococcus nuclease to digest covalently associated DNA away from TOP1, very distinct TOP1 conjugates could be seen in the parental cell line FM3A that had been incubated at either 37 or 42 °C. These conjugates were also present in ts85 incubated at the permissive temperature but were absent in ts85 incubated at the restrictive temperature for E1, where ubiquitin conjugation to cellular proteins is known to be deficient (Fig.2). These results suggest that the ladder of TOP1-immunoreactive bands is composed of multi-Ub conjugates of TOP1. To determine whether Ub-TOP1 conjugates were destroyed, we quantified the steady state levels of TOP1 during CPT treatment using Western blotting. In these experiments, FM3A cells were treated with CPT for 0.25–4 h. The CPT was then washed away, and the cells were incubated in medium without CPT for 30 min at 37 °C to allow ample time for the cleavable complexes to dissociate before the cells were lysed with SDS. Using this protocol, CPT treatment caused the TOP1 level to drop by an average of 25% after 15 min and by 80% after 2 h in cells that were treated at either the permissive or the restrictive temperature. A reduction in TOP1 level in CPT-treated cells was previously published in a study with another cell line (23Beidler D.R. Cheng Y.C. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 47: 907-914PubMed Google Scholar). TOP1 levels were similarly reduced in ts85 incubated at the permissive temperature but remained unchanged in ts85 at the restrictive temperature for the thermolabile E1 (Fig.3). This result suggests that the destruction of TOP1 in CPT-treated cells requires a functional E1. Although the TOP1 level remained constant in ts85 during CPT treatment at the restrictive temperature, the phosphorylation state of the enzyme changed (17D'Arpa P. Liu L.F. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 217: 125-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar); the slow migrating phosphorylated form diminished and the fast migrating form intensified (Fig. 3). This change in phosphorylation state was independent of CPT treatment, suggesting that it is an effect of E1 inactivation. We then determined whether the Ub-associated drop in TOP1 level during CPT treatment was due to reduced de novo synthesis of TOP1 or its proteolytic destruction. To block de novo synthesis of TOP1, FM3A cells were treated with the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide, which by itself did not appreciably affect TOP1 levels during a 2-h treatment (data not shown). In cells treated with CPT together with cycloheximide, the reduction in TOP1 level was not different than after CPT treatment alone, suggesting that TOP1 levels were reduced as a result of increased proteolytic destruction (data not shown). To analyze the relationship between cleavable complex formation, multi-Ub TOP1 conjugate formation and TOP1 destruction, the CPT dose dependence of each of these effects was determined. CPT concentrations in the range of 0.8–10 μm were added to FM3A cells. To analyze the dose dependence of cleavable complex formation, cells treated with CPT for 10 min were immediately lysed to detect the amount of TOP1 covalently linked to DNA. Although this method produces variable results, probably due to variability in the shearing of DNA from TOP1 during sample preparation, at the highest dose of CPT (10 μm), about 70% of TOP1 can be seen linked to DNA indicated by an absence of immunoreactive TOP1 at 100 kDa (Fig.4, A and C). These same CPT treatment conditions caused about 5–10% of TOP1 to be conjugated with Ub (Fig. 4, B and C). For analysis of the destruction of TOP1, cells were washed free of CPT after a 2-h exposure and were then incubated for 30 min at 37 °C to allow time for the cleavable complexes to reverse before lysis with SDS. The 2-h CPT treatment caused the destruction of about 70% of TOP1 at the highest dose (Fig. 4, D and E). Thus, the concentration of CPT required to trap TOP1 in the cleavable complex (Fig. 4, A and C) closely paralleled the concentration required to stimulate the multi-Ub conjugation of TOP1 (Fig. 4, B and C) and the destruction of TOP1 (Fig. 4, D and E). This result suggests that TOP1 trapped in the cleavable complex is conjugated with ubiquitin and destroyed. To analyze the effect of CPT treatment on the half-life of TOP1, FM3A or ts85 cells were metabolically labeled with [35S]methionine and either were not treated or were treated with CPT during the chase period. Cells were then lysed at 2 and 4 h post-chase, and TOP1 was salt-extracted from nuclei, immunoprecipitated, and subjected to SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. In untreated FM3A and ts85 cells at the permissive temperatures, no more than 20% of TOP1 disappeared after the 4-h chase, corresponding to a half-life of TOP1 greater than 10 h. At the restrictive temperature, the rate of destruction of TOP1 in untreated cells was not detectably different than at permissive temperature. After treatment with CPT, however, the TOP1 half-life dropped to about 1.2 h in FM3A cells at both temperatures (data not shown). In ts85 at permissive temperature, the half-life of TOP1 was similarly shortened (Fig.5, A and B). In ts85 cells at restrictive temperature, the half-life of TOP1 did not change (Fig. 5, A and B). These results confirm the requirement for a functional E1 enzyme in the CPT-induced destruction of TOP1 and show an 8-fold shortening of the TOP1 half-life during CPT treatment. Ub-protein conjugates are substrates for proteolysis by the 26S proteasome. To determine if the destruction of TOP1 might be mediated by the 26S proteasome, FM3A cells were preincubated with either of the specific proteasome inhibitors MG-132 or lactacystin (24Fenteany G. Standaert R.F. Lane W.S. Choi S. Corey E.J. Schreiber S.L. Science. 1995; 268: 726-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (1496) Google Scholar, 25Lee D.H. Goldberg A.L. J. Biol.

Immunol. 1995; 155: 3750-3758PubMed Google Scholar). These inhibitors blocked the CPT-induced destruction of TOP1 (Fig.6). This result indicates that the multi-Ub-TOP1 conjugates are proteolyzed by the 26S proteasome. Although the proteasome inhibitors prevented the destruction of TOP1, accumulation of Ub-TOP1 conjugates was not observed. In our experiments, the multi-Ub-TOP1 conjugates were formed within minutes, similar to the kinetics for the formation of the TOP1 cleavable complex (within 2–5 min, data not shown), suggesting that TOP1 trapped by CPT in the cleavable complex is recognized as a substrate for ubiquitination. CPT binds very specifically to TOP1 only in the presence of DNA (28Hertzberg R.P. Caranfa M.J. Hecht S.M. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 4629-4638Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar). The production of this ternary cleavable complex composed of TOP1-DNA-CPT is the only known activity of CPT. Thus it is unlikely that another type of CPT-TOP1 complex without DNA might be a substrate for ubiquitination. Furthermore, the R isomers of two CPT derivatives that do not produce the cleavable complex did not cause Ub-TOP1 conjugation, whereas their S isomers that produce the cleavable complex did stimulate Ub-TOP1 conjugation (data not shown). Also, conjugation of Ub to topoisomerase II-α was not stimulated by CPT, further indicating the specificity of the ubiquitin conjugation to TOP1 in cells treated with CPT (data not shown). TOP1 in rodent cells can be seen by SDS-PAGE as a doublet of electrophoretically distinct forms that differ in phosphorylation state. One of these phosphorylated forms diminishes when transcription is inhibited (17D'Arpa P. Liu L.F. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 217: 125-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Whether these forms are differentially ubiquitinated is currently unknown. Modification of proteins by multi-Ub chains makes them substrates for proteolysis by the 26S proteasome. This proteolysis pathway is an integral and essential part of cellular processes (29Finley D. Chau V. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1991; 7: 25-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar, 30Ciechanover A. Schwartz A.L. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 182-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 31Ciechanover A. Cell. 1994; 79: 13-21Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1597) Google Scholar, 32Hochstrasser M. Cell. 1996; 84: 813-815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). The 76 amino acid ubiquitin molecule is linked though its carboxyl terminus to Lys residue(s) (isopeptide bond) of substrate proteins in a three-step mechanism: 1) the carboxyl terminus of ubiquitin links to the ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1) through a thiol ester in an ATP-requiring step; 2) ubiquitin is then transferred via transacylation to the active site cysteine of a conjugating enzyme (E2), which in some cases can directly conjugate ubiquitin to proteins in vitro; or 3) a ubiquitin-ligating enzyme (E3) that binds the ubiquitin-charged E2 enzyme as well as the substrate protein and in some cases can form a thiol ester with ubiquitin before transferring it to the substrate (33Gonen H. Stancovski I. Shkedy D. Hadari T. Bercovich B. Bengal E. Mesilati S. Abu H.O. Schwartz A.L. Ciechanover A. J. Biol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 324-330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) is also required for the specific conjugation to many cellular substrates. The conjugation of ubiquitin to free ubiquitin, or to ubiquitin conjugated to substrate proteins can produce free multi-Ub chains or multi-Ub conjugates of substrate proteins. The subunits of multi-Ub are linked from the carboxyl terminus of one ubiquitin to the next though Lys48, most frequently, although other linkages have been identified (35Arnason T. Ellison M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7876-7883Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 36Johnson E.S. Ma P.C. Ota I.M. Varshavsky A. J. Biol.

In our experiments, an apparent Ub-TOP1 conjugate in untreated cells (detected by multiple TOP1 antisera; data not shown) co-migrated with the first conjugate in CPT-treated cells (see Figs. 1 and 2). The role of this Ub-TOP1 conjugate is unknown, but it may be an intermediate in the multi-Ub conjugation that may mark this long-lived protein (39Heck M.M.S. Hittelman W.N. Earnshaw W.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 1086-1090Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar) for proteolytic destruction during normal turnover. Alternatively, it may be similar to the stably monoubiquitinated histones H2A and H2B, which have been implicated to be preferentially associated with transcribed DNA (40Ericsson C. Goldknopf I.L. Daneholt B. Exp. Cell Res. 1986; 167: 127-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 41Davie J.R. Murphy L.C. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 4752-4757Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Monoubiquitinations of small basic proteins in vitrohave been shown to be catalyzed by a group of ubiquitin-carrier enzymes in a reaction that does not require a ubiquitin-protein ligase activity. Some of these monoubiquitinating ubiquitin-carrier enzymes have been shown by genetic studies to be involved in a variety of fundamental cellular processes (30Ciechanover A. Schwartz A.L. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 182-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar); however, the function of the monoubiquitinations is unknown. TOP1, like the ubiquitinated histones H2A and H2B, is highly basic (calculated isoelectric point of 10.05) (42D'Arpa P. Machlin P.S. Ratrie III, H. Rothfield N.F. Cleveland D.W. Earnshaw W.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 2543-2547Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar) and localized to transcribed regions (8Zhang H. Wang J.C. Liu L.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 1060-1064Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar), and therefore it may be monoubiquitinated for similar reasons. The structural characteristics that stimulate the ubiquitination of the TOP1 cleavable complex at present remain unknown. Polypeptide elements that stimulate ubiquitination have been studied by inserting random polypeptides into β-galactosidase. These studies have identified clusters of hydrophobic residues that appear to be critical for stimulating ubiquitin conjugation and destruction (43Sadis S. Atienza C.J. Finley D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4086-4094Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). One possibility is that a normally buried hydrophobic region of TOP1 becomes exposed when the enzyme is trapped in the cleavable complex. In our studies, six TOP1 immunoreactive bands were consistently observed between the 100-kDa TOP1 and the 200-kDa (prestained myosin) molecular mass standard (Fig. 1). Analysis of the apparent molecular masses of the first four of these bands (determined fromR F) showed differences between successive bands of between 14 and 17 kDa instead of the 8-kDa shifts known to result from the conjugation of ubiquitin monomers to substrate proteins. A possible explanation for this result is that only even-numbered Ub-TOP1 conjugates are present, which might suggest that their formation is favored or that odd-numbered ubiquitin conjugates are preferentially deubiquitinated or destroyed. The possibility that odd-numbered conjugates may be preferentially destroyed may be less likely because analysis of the binding of Ub-lysozyme conjugates to the 26S proteasome subunit 5 showed that efficient avidity required at least four ubiquitins, providing no basis for the preferential binding of odd-numbered Ub conjugates (38Baboshina O.V. Haas A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2823-2831Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 44Deveraux Q. Ustrell V. Pickart C. Rechsteiner M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7059-7061Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Another possibility we consider less likely is that the conjugates are actually ubiquitin cross-reactive protein (UCRP). Although the size of UCRP (15 kDa) roughly coincides with the size of the TOP1 band shifts, previous studies indicate that the activation and conjugation of UCRP to cellular proteins probably occurs by a pathway distinct from the ubiquitin pathway; the affinity of E1 for UCRP is much lower than for ubiquitin, and moreover, UCRP concentrations are significantly lower than ubiquitin concentrations in cells; evidence is also lacking for the presence of multi-UCRP chains and for the destruction of proteins conjugated with UCRP (34Narasimhan J. Potter J.L. Haas A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 324-330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). In addition, treatment of U937 cells with type I interferons increases the conjugation of UCRP to numerous cellular proteins (45Loeb K.R. Haas A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7806-7813Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but this treatment did not affect the abundance of the TOP1 conjugates (data not shown). However, our experiments cannot eliminate the possibility that UCRP or another UCRP-like protein (46Fan W. Cai W. Parimoo S. Lennon G.G. Weissman S.M. Immunogenetics. 1996; 44: 97-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) that can form multiple conjugates may be responsible for the multi-Ub conjugates of TOP1. Finally, the electrophoretic mobility shifts of 14–17 kDa could result from an even-numbered ubiquitin conjugates being preferentially formed. The crystal structure of a diubiquitin conjugate (Ub2) shows that the molecule exhibits a 2-fold symmetry dictating that a third ubiquitin molecule must attach in a different way to Ub2 (47Cook W.J. Jeffrey L.C. Carson M. Chen Z. Pickart C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16467-16471Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the rate of addition of odd-numbered Ub units may be slow relative to even-numbered additions resulting in the predominance of even-numbered conjugates at steady state. Another possible explanation of the apparent even-numbered ubiquitin conjugates of TOP1 is that they are produced by the sequential addition of two ubiquitin molecules in the form of Ub2. Precedence for this type of mechanism is provided by experiments demonstrating activation of Ub2 by E1, its transfer to E2, and its ligation to histones H2A/B through an E3-independent mechanism in vitro(48van Nocker S. Vierstra R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24766-24773Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In these experiments Ub2 and Ub4conjugated as effectively as ubiquitin monomers. Free multimeric chains of ubiquitin have been found in cells providing support for the hypothesis that chains of multi-Ub may be conjugated in a single step to substrate proteins in vivo (48van Nocker S. Vierstra R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24766-24773Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In our experiments about 90% of cellular TOP1 was trapped in the cleavable complex after CPT treatment (25 μm), but only 5–10% was conjugated to ubiquitin. Several hypotheses can account for this small fraction of Ub-TOP1 conjugates despite the great majority of TOP1 being in the cleavable complex. These include: 1) the TOP1 cleavable complexes may be saturating with respect to the ubiquitin conjugating components; 2) only a small fraction of cleavable complexes may be sequestrated to regions where they can be Ub-conjugated; and 3) the Ub-TOP1 conjugates may be in a competition between Ub-dependent destruction and ubiquitin chain removal by ubiquitin-specific proteases that might function when the cleavable complex, in rapid reversible equilibrium with the noncleavable form, dissociates. Finally, a combination of these possibilities may account for the small fraction of Ub-TOP1 despite the large fraction of TOP1 in the cleavable complex. Interestingly, when the proteasome was inhibited, the Ub-TOP1 conjugates did not accumulate. Whatever the predominant pathway, the enzymes for ubiquitination and ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis are proposed to be present in complexes (32Hochstrasser M. Cell. 1996; 84: 813-815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar, 49Haas A.L. Bright P.M. Jackson V.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 13268-13275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which may suggest that the ubiquitin system enzymes that act on TOP1 may be closely associated with active chomatin. It is possible that the TOP1 cleavable complex becomes a substrate for ubiquitin conjugation only after being acted on by DNA metabolizing enzymes, which could be the rate-limiting step in the Ub-TOP1 conjugation. The active DNA replication fork is known to convert the TOP1 cleavable complex into a DNA double-strand break and to arrest at the site of the breakage (9Ryan A.J. Squires S. Strutt H.L. Evans A. Johnson R.T. Carcinogenesis. 1994; 15: 823-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 10Avemann K. Knippers R. Koller T. Sogo J.M. Mol. Cell.

To test the possibility that the replication fork might produce the TOP1 substrate for ubiquitination, cells were treated with aphidicolin, an inhibitor of replicative DNA polymerases, before and during CPT treatment. Aphidicolin treatment prevents the double-strand breaks and the lethality produced by CPT, but it had no effect on the quantity of Ub-TOP1 conjugates (data not shown). We also tested whether transcription might be necessary for converting TOP1 into a substrate for ubiquitination. Neither of the transcription inhibitors actinomycin D or 5,6-dichloro-1-β-d-ribofuranosyl benzimidazole affected the quantity of Ub-TOP1 conjugates in CPT treated cells (data not shown). We speculate that a pathway for the repair of protein-DNA adducts may be responsible for the Ub-dependent destruction of TOP1. We have recently observed the Ub-dependent destruction of topoisomerase II following treatment of cells with specific inhibitors that trap this enzyme in a similar cleavable complex. 2S. D. Desai, L. F. Liu, and P. D'Arpa, manuscript in preparation. We are continuing studies to understand the role of ubiquitin conjugation in the regulation of topoisomerases and in the response to antitumor inhibitors that trap the cleavable complex.

Although structural features indicate that the presenilins are membrane proteins, their function(s) is unknown. We have localized the presenilins to the nuclear membrane, its associated interphase kinetochores, and the centrosomes—all subcellular structures involved in cell cycle regulation and mitosis. The colocalization of the presenilins with kinetochores on the nucleoplasmic surface of the inner nuclear membrane, together with other results, suggests that they may play a role in chromosome organization and segregation, perhaps as kinetochore binding proteins/ receptors. We discuss a pathogenic pathway for familial Alzheimer's disease in which defective presenilin function causes chromosome missegregation during mitosis, resulting in apoptosis and/or trisomy 21 mosaicism."

Using a mouse lymphoid cell line transfected with human formyl peptide or interleukin-8 receptors and normal human neutrophils as models, we show that cAMP functions as a gating element on the chemoattractant-induced rho-dependent signaling pathway leading to leukocyte integrin activation and adhesion. cAMP, acting through protein kinase A, inhibits chemoattractant-triggered integrin-dependent leukocyte adhesion. cAMP also prevents guanine nucleotide exchange on RhoA, a small GTP-binding protein of the rho subfamily, which is activated in seconds by chemoattractants. In contrast, chemoattractant-triggered intracellular calcium elevation is unaffected by cAMP, and cAMP has no effect on rho-dependent adhesion and RhoA guanine nucleotide exchange triggered through the independent protein kinase C pathway. These data suggest that cAMP-induced inhibition of rho activation may be responsible for the anti-adhesive effect of cAMP and may contribute to the anti-inflammatory activity of cAMP elevating agonists and drugs. Moreover, the findings extend the concept of cyclic nucleotide gating as a broadly important mechanism in the regulation of intracellular signaling pathways and the cellular activities they control.

The regulation of integrin-dependent adhesion and de-adhesion is important in leukocyte cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions in immunity and inflammation. Serpentine receptors of the Gαi-linked chemoattractant receptor subfamily have been implicated in leukocyte adhesion regulation and are thought to play essential roles in controlling leukocyte trafficking and homingin vivo. These receptors stimulate an amplified and branching cascade of second messengers triggered through either α or βγ subunits of heterotrimeric GTP-binding proteins (1Milligan G. Adv. Pharmacol. 1995; 32: 1-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The small GTP-binding protein rho has recently been identified as a critical element in the signaling cascade responsible for fast integrin-dependent leukocyte adhesion (2Laudanna C. Campbell J.J.

We report that intracellular cAMP, acting through protein kinase A (PKA), abrogates the proadhesive response of lymphoid cells and of neutrophils to chemoattractant but not to phorbol ester stimulation. This inhibitory effect is associated with blockade of chemoattractant-induced guanine nucleotide exchange on the small GTP-binding protein RhoA, suggesting that cAMP-dependent PKA acts as a negative modulator or “gate” on the chemoattractant to rho to integrin signaling pathway.DISCUSSIONWe have shown that elevation of intracellular levels of cAMP blocks chemoattractant stimulation of α4β1-integrin activation in lymphoid cells, and β2-integrin triggering in neutrophils. The effect is mediated by PKA, and this PKA-dependent inhibition occurs downstream of heterotrimeric G-protein activation but upstream of the small GTPase RhoA, a critical mediator of chemoattractant to integrin signaling (2Laudanna C.

Our results expand this concept to include cAMP and its effector, PKA, as gating elements in chemoattractant stimulation of rho and of rho-dependent integrin activity leading to leukocyte adhesion.An independent example of the negative role of cAMP on rho-dependent signaling has been previously suggested. In a study of human NK cells, cAMP inhibited spontaneous rho-dependent slow cell movement. In that model, PKA phosphorylation of active (GTP-bound) RhoA induced gradual rho-guanine dissociation inhibitor mediated translocation of GTP-RhoA from the plasma membrane to the cytosol (15Lang P. Gesbert F. Delespine-Carmagnat M. Stancou R. Pouchelet M. Bertoglio J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 510-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar), thus terminating rho signaling over several minutes. This contrasts with the inhibition of chemoattractant-stimulated RhoA GDP/GTP exchange by cAMP, reported here, which allows cAMP to prevent the initiation of rho signaling, thus blocking the rapid rho-dependent triggering of integrins by chemoattractants. Thus, it appears that cAMP can be a negative modulator of rho through two separate mechanisms, either by preventing rapid rho activation, as shown here, or by terminating an already active rho-signaling pathway, increasing the capability of rho-guanine dissociation inhibitor to bind rho. Moreover, our data show for the first time that cAMP can inhibit a small GTP-binding protein-dependent pathway by blocking the activation of the GTPase itself (Fig. 4).In addition to triggering integrin activation rho mediates cytoskeletal remodeling (16Hall A. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 31-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (764) Google Scholar), and in both of these roles it is thought to be important to cell trafficking. The inhibitory activity of PKA on rho activation in leukocytes may thus help explain the ability of some cAMP-elevating drugs to inhibit leukocyte transendothelial migrationin vitro and recruitment and homing in vivo(17Valitutti S.

The regulation of integrin-dependent adhesion and de-adhesion is important in leukocyte cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions in immunity and inflammation. Serpentine receptors of the Gαi-linked chemoattractant receptor subfamily have been implicated in leukocyte adhesion regulation and are thought to play essential roles in controlling leukocyte trafficking and homingin vivo. These receptors stimulate an amplified and branching cascade of second messengers triggered through either α or βγ subunits of heterotrimeric GTP-binding proteins (1Milligan G. Adv. Pharmacol. 1995; 32: 1-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar).

After an interval of 2 weeks, the infants heard lists of words that either occurred frequently or did not occur in the stories. The infants listened significantly longer to the lists of story words. By comparison, a control group of infants who had not been exposed to the stories showed no such preference. The findings suggest that 8-month-olds are beginning to engage in long-term storage of words that occur frequently in speech, which is an important prerequisite for learning language."

For the mutant human fibrosarcoma cell lines, phosphorylation of IRS-1 through the insulin-like growth factor receptor is independent of JAK1, JAK2, or Tyk2. In contrast, phosphorylation of IRS-1 mediated by the Type I IFNs, IL-4, and OSM is JAK-dependent. For the αβ-IFNs, activation of IRS-1 is dependent on JAK1 and Tyk2, consistent with the interdependence of these kinases in the IFN-αβ response. Neither IRS-1 nor IRS-2 was detectably activated by IFN-γ. Consistent with this, activation of neither IRS proteins appears to be an absolute requirement for an antiproliferative or an antiviral response to the IFNs. For IL-4 and OSM phosphorylation of IRS-1 in the human fibrosarcoma cells is largely dependent on JAK1 but can also be mediated through Tyk2 or JAK2. Activation of phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinase in response to IL-4 and OSM, at least, was also JAK-dependent.

An L(X)4NPXY(p)XSXP motif has been identified in the insulin receptor as being important for the recruitment of the IRS proteins. IRS-1 contains multiple YMXM and YXXM tyrosine motifs, which when phosphorylated can recruit Src homology 2 domain-containing proteins, including the p85α regulatory subunit of PI 3′-kinase, SHP-2, Grb-2, Crk, and Nck (3Sun X.J.

Phosphorylated IRS-1, therefore, can mediate a variety of responses including a mitogenic response and activation of PI 3′-kinase. Common themes involving the role of tyrosine kinases and proteins with Src homology 2 domains have emerged to describe broadly the mechanism of signal transduction by many growth factors and cytokines. Signal transduction pathways utilizing the JAK (Janus kinase) family of protein-tyrosine kinases and the STATs (signal transducers and activators of transcription) are activated in response to polypeptide ligands including many cytokines, some growth factors and the interferons (IFNs). STAT activation mediated through the JAKs occurs in receptor complexes at the cell membrane. There are four known mammalian JAKs: JAK1, JAK2, JAK3, and Tyk2 (5Wilks A.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Each is ∼130 kDa in mass and has a C-terminal tyrosine kinase domain, an adjacent kinase-related domain, and five additional domains extending toward the N-terminus with similarity between the family members. JAK1, JAK2, and Tyk2 appear to be widely expressed, whereas the expression of JAK3 occurs predominantly, if not exclusively, in cells of the hematopoietic system.

Different cytokines activate different combinations of JAKs and STATs. JAK autophosphorylation/activation occurs on receptor dimerization/oligomerization in response to ligand with consequent phosphorylation of the receptor. Specific STATs, associated with or recruited to the JAK/receptor complex, are phosphorylated, released, migrate to the nucleus, and, with or without additional factors, activate transcription (reviewed in Refs. 17Darnell J.E.

Briefly, cells were lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100 (v/v), 10% glycerol (v/v), 50 mm Hepes, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8, 200 μm sodium orthovanadate, 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 100 mm sodium fluoride 1.5 mm magnesium chloride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin). Nuclei were removed by centrifugation. Appropriate antibodies and a mixture of protein A- and protein G-Sepharose (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) were added and incubated for 18 h at 4 °C. The immunoprecipitates were washed in ice-cold lysis buffer (with 0.1% Triton X-100 (v/v)) electrophoresed on 6.5% polyacrylamide-SDS gels (62Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207192) Google Scholar) and blotted to Immobilon™ polyvinylidene difluoride (Millipore) membranes. Membranes were blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin (fraction V) (w/v) in TBST (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 75 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% Tween 20 (v/v)) containing 1 mmsodium orthovanadate for 1 h, incubated with the relevant primary antibody for 1 h, washed in TBST, incubated for 30 min with peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody, rewashed, and exposed to enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Life Science), followed by fluorography (Kodak AR). When reprobed, membranes were stripped in 0.1 m glycine, pH 2.5, for 1 h, washed in phosphate-buffered saline and TBST, and incubated with the appropriate primary and secondary antibodies as above. Cells were lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40 (v/v), 50 mm Hepes, 150 mm NaCl, 200 μm sodium orthovanadate, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mm sodium fluoride, 10 mm iodoacetamide, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin). Nuclei were removed by centrifugation. IRS-1 antibodies and a mixture of protein A- and protein G-Sepharose (Pharmacia) were added and incubated for 18 h at 4 °C. The immunoprecipitates were washed in ice-cold lysis buffer, twice in 100 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 0.5 m LiCl, 100 μm sodium vanadate and twice in 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8, containing 100 μm sodium vanadate, resuspended in 10 μl of lipid mixture (1 mg/ml each ofl-α-phosphatidylinositol andl-α-phosphatidyl-l-serine, dispersed by sonication in 25 mm Hepes buffer, pH 7.4, 1 mmEDTA). The reaction was initiated by the addition of 50 nm[γ-32P]ATP (5 μCi) and 125 μm ATP in 40 μl of 12.5 mm MgCl2, 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 125 mm NaCl. After 15 min at 25 °C, the reaction was terminated by the addition of 500 μl of chloroform:methanol (1:2) in 0.12 m HCl. 125 μl of chloroform and 125 μl of 10 mm HCl was then added. The mixture was vigorously vortexed and centrifuged to separate the phases. 200 μl of the organic phase was removed and washed with 400 μl of methanol, 100 mm HCl, 2 mm EDTA (1:1). The organic phase was removed and dried in vacuo and resuspended in chloroform. The phospholipids were separated by thin layer chromatography (TLC) in propan-1-ol:acetic acid (2 n) (65:35) (v:v), and visualized by autoradiography. 32D parental cells and IRS-1/2 transfectants were plated at 4 × 103cells/well in 96-well plates in RPMI, 10% FCS plus 10 IU/ml rmIL-3 in the presence or absence of interferons (1 × 103IU/ml) as indicated. At days 3 and 5, cell numbers were measured by Coulter counter (Coulter Electronics, United Kingdom) and corrected for coincidence. Densitometry was carried out on autoradiographs of an appropriate exposure using a LKB Ultroscan XL laser densitometer. Three regions of any given band were analyzed and an average obtained, which was corrected against a signal representing the loading of the analyzed protein. For the PI 3′-kinase assay, quantitation of the signals was with a Molecular Dynamics Storm 860 PhosphorImager, directly from the TLC plate. The dependence upon JAK1 of IRS-1 phosphorylation in response to IL-4, OSM, or IFN-α in the appropriate cell lines was assessed by Fisher's exact test. The association of PI 3′-kinase activity with immunoprecipitation of IRS-1 was assessed by Friedman's nonparametric analysis of variance (61Conover W.J. Practical Nonparametric Statistics.2nd Ed. John Wiley & Sons, New York1980Google Scholar), and the effect of IFN on growth of murine 32D cells was assessed by standard analysis of variance. IRS-1 is constitutively phosphorylated on tyrosine in the wild-type and mutant human fibrosarcoma cell lines. The phosphorylation is sustained in the absence of serum and is variable in cells passaged using trypsin, but is ablated in the presence of antibody to the IGF-1 receptor (IGFR). It is independent of the JAKs and is thought to reflect activation of the intrinsic IGFR kinase through an autocrine loop. Examples of the data are included with those for IL-4 (Fig. 1 A). Treatment with antibody to the IGFR was, therefore, routinely carried out to lower the constitutive levels of phosphorylation of IRS-1 throughout all of the experiments in which cells of this type were used. Such treatment in the presence or absence of IFNs was without effect on cell growth or the response to the IFNs over several days. Tyrosyl phosphorylation of IRS-1 was observed in response to IL-4 in wild-type cells (2C4) and in cells lacking JAK2 (γ2A) and Tyk2 (U1D), but not in cells lacking JAK1 (U4A) (Fig. 1 A, lanes 3,9, 12, and 6, respectively). In contrast, the constitutive phosphorylation of IRS-1 through the IGFR was not affected by the absence of JAK1, JAK2 or Tyk2 (Fig. 1,lanes 1, 4, 7, and 10). For IL-4, phosphorylation of IRS-1 was restored in the U4A cells lacking JAK1 on stable transfection with wild-type (U4A/JAK1) but not a kinase-negative mutant of JAK1 (U4A/JAK1.K→E; Ref. 50Guschin D. Rogers N. Briscoe J. Witthuhn B. Watling D. Horn F. Pellegrini S. Yasukawa K. Heinrich P. Stark G.R. Ihle J. Kerr I.M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1421-1429Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar) (Fig.1 B, lanes 7 and 9). Interestingly, JAK1, JAK2, and Tyk2 are all activated in response to IL-4 in these cells and phosphorylation in response to IL-4 was restored by overexpression of Tyk2 (Fig. 1 B, lane 13) and, to a lesser extent, JAK2 (Fig. 1 B, lane 11), as well as by JAK1 (lane 7). Activation of IRS-1 by IL-4, but not through the IGFR, is, therefore, dependent on JAK activation in these cells.

https://openalex.org/W1965890828,"In fat and skeletal muscle cells, glucose transporter isoform 4 (Glut4) is translocated to the cell surface in response to insulin via a system of specialized recycling vesicles. Besides Glut4, these vesicles include the novel insulin-regulatable aminopeptidase, receptors for insulin-like growth factor-II/Man-6-phosphate and transferrin, and a glycoprotein with the molecular mass of 110 kDa. We report here by the criteria of the partial protein sequencing and subsequent cDNA cloning that glycoprotein 110, the last unidentified major protein component of Glut4-containing vesicles, is sortilin, a novel type I receptor-like protein recently cloned from human brain (Petersen, C.

This protein is highly expressed in fat, brain, and lung and is dramatically up-regulated during differentiation of adipocytes in vitro. The regulation of blood glucose levels by insulin in mammals is achieved by the hormone-dependent movement of the fat and muscle-specific glucose transporter, Glut4, from an intracellular storage vesicle to the cell surface (1Kahn B.B.

As an approach to understand the mechanisms underlying this process, we and others have isolated these vesicles using anti-Glut4 antibodies and have analyzed their protein content by several techniques. Thus, immunoisolation of Glut4-containing vesicles following cell surface biotinylation in the presence of insulin revealed three major component proteins in these vesicles (gp230, gp160, and gp110) 1The abbreviations used are: gp, glycoprotein; IRAP, insulin-regulated aminopeptidase; Man-6-P, mannose 6-phosphate; IGF, insulin-like growth factor; EST, expressed sequence tag; FBS, fetal bovine serum; RAP, receptor-associated protein. that corresponded to major silver staining vesicular proteins present in the basal state (no insulin) (5Kandror K.V.

These proteins bind to wheat germ agglutinin-agarose and can be detected in an overlay assay with labeled wheat germ lectin, and therefore they are glycoproteins (5Kandror K.V. Pilch P.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 138-142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, we were able to detect an additional protein, gp180, which follows the same trafficking pathway as the former proteins but represents a relatively minor component of Glut4 vesicles. We and others have studied these proteins and have identified gp160 as a novel insulin-regulated aminopeptidase, or IRAP (6Kandror K.V. Yu L. Pilch P.F. J. Biol.

Pilch, unpublished observations.Here, we report the identification of gp110, apparently the last major component protein of Glut4-containing vesicles, as the recently described putative sorting protein/receptor, sortilin (9Petersen C.M.

Adipocytes were isolated from the epididymal fat pads of male Sprague-Dawley rats (150–175 g) by collagenase digestion and fractionated into subcellular fractions by differential centrifugation according to Simpson et al. (10Simpson I.A. Yver D.R. Hissin P.J. Wardzala L.J. Karnieli E. Salans L.B. Cushman S.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 763: 393-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). Light microsomes were immunoadsorbed on monoclonal anti-Glut4 antibody, 1F8 (11James D.E. Brown R. Navarro J. Pilch P.F. Nature. 1988; 333: 183-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar), and covalently immobilized on Reacti Gel GF 2000 (Pierce), and the bound material was eluted with 1% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline. Nonspecific adsorption was controlled by passage of microsomes over total mouse IgG (Sigma) immobilized on the same beads at the same protein concentration. A peptide excised from purified p110 (peptide 2 in Fig. 1) was found to be 93.7% identical to the translated peptide of Homo sapiens cDNA clone 249708 (accession number H85743) derived from a normalized human expressed sequence tag (EST) cDNA library. This clone was purchased from Genome Sequencing Center at Washington University School of Medicine, and the whole insert of the clone (1330 base pairs) was sequenced. The sequenced insert was found 99.5% identical to Human sortilin (9Petersen C.M. Nielsen M.S. Nykjar A. Jacobsen L. Tommerup N. Rasmussen H.H. Roigaard H. Gliemann J. Madsen P. Moestrup S.K. J. Biol.

All probes were labeled by random priming using the Klenow fragemt of DNA polymerase (Promega) and [α-32P]dCTP (NEN Life Science Products). The DNA insert of Homo sapiens cDNA clone 249708 was excised with XhoI/NotI digestion, labeled with [α-32P]dCTP by random priming, and used to screen 5′-stretch cDNA libraries from skeletal muscle (primed with oligo(dT) + random primers, respectively) of adult male Sprague-Dawley rats (CLONTECH). Seven 150-mm agar plates each containing 50,000 phage plaques were transferred to nylon filter disks (NEN Life Science Products) and hybridized to probe as described in manufacturer's instruction. Positive clones were picked and rescreened until single clones were obtained. Lambda DNA clones were purified by Nucleobond AX (The Nest Group, Inc.) and directly sequenced using gt11 primers and synthetic oligonucleotide primers corresponding to the gene-specific sequence. 3T3-L1 preadipocytes were maintained in growth medium consisting of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% normal calf serum (Intergen, Co.) and were induced to differentiation as described previously (12Student A.K. Hsu R.Y. Lane M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 4745-4750Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Adipogenesis was induced by feeding with fresh medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 0.5 mm methylisobutylxanthine, 1 μmdexamethazone, and 5 μg of insulin/ml for 48 h. The cells were subsequently maintained in medium containing 10% FBS and 2.5 μg of insulin/ml for an additional 48 h and were refed every 2 days with 10% FBS medium. Total RNA was isolated from rat tissues or 3T3-L1 cells as described by Chomczynski and Sacchi (13Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63232) Google Scholar). Tissues were homogenized in solution D (4 m guanidinium thiocyanate, 25 mm sodium citrate, pH 7.0, 0.5% Sarkosyl, 0.1 m 2-mercaptoethanol). Cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lyzed with solution D. The lysate was extracted with acidic phenol-chloroform and then subjected to an isopropanol precipitation at −20 °C. Poly(A)+ RNA was selected using a oligo(dT) cellulose (Type 3, Collaborative Biomedical Products) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For Northern blot analysis, 20 μg of total RNA or 5 μg of poly(A)+ were separated on formaldehyde agarose gels and transferred to Gene Screen Plus by capillary transfer (NEN Life Science Products). After ultraviolet+ cross-linking, filters were prehybrized, hybridized, and subjected to analysis as described previously (14Cornelius P. Marlowe M. Lee M.D. Pekala P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20506-20516Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For rehybridization, the probe was stripped from membrane by washing the membrane in boiled 0.1 × SSC/0.1% SDS twice, each for 10 min. The cDNA utilized in these studies were: sortilin (rat) and Glut4. Protein samples were separated in SDS-polyacrylamide gels according to Laemmli (15Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207538) Google Scholar) and transferred to Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore) in 25 mmTris, 192 mm glycine. Following transfer, the membrane was blocked with 10% nonfat dry milk, and proteins were visualized with the help of a chemiluminescent substrate kit (Amersham Corp.). An antiserum to sortilin was prepared in rabbits by QCB (Hopkinton, MA) using peptide 2 (Fig. 1) coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin. Protein content was determined with a BCA kit (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions. As discussed in the Introduction, the polypeptide composition of Glut4-containing vesicles as revealed by the silver staining and/or biotinylation of the material specifically bound to 1F8-beads consists of three major glycoproteins that we have called gp230, gp160, and gp110 (5Kandror K.V.

The first two are the IGF-II/Man-6-phosphate receptor (8Kandror K.V. Pilch P.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21703-21708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) and IRAP, respectively (6Kandror K.V. Yu L. Pilch P.F. J. Biol.

A. 1994; 91: 8017-8021Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). To identify gp110, we isolated adipocytes from 60 rats, prepared the light microsomal fraction from these cells (see “Materials and Methods”) and immunoadsorbed Glut4-containing vesicles. After SDS-electrophoresis and transfer, their component proteins were visualized by Coomassie staining of the Immobilon-P membrane. The region of the Immobilon membrane corresponding to gp110 was excised. Following tryptic digestion and separation of peptide fragments by high pressure liquid chromatography, sequences for three peptides were obtained by Dr. W. Lane and associates at the Harvard MicroChem laboratory (Fig.1). The sequence of peptide 2, a 16-mer, was found in the EST data base with one amino acid difference. The corresponding human clone was purchased, sequenced, and used as a probe to screen a rat skeletal muscle cDNA library as described under “Materials and Methods.” Nine independent clones were isolated, and sequencing of the largest one yielded 1872 base pairs in the coding region of the rat cDNA with a predicted protein sequence having 93% identity to the EST sequence and subsequently to the recently published human sortilin clone (Fig. 1) (9Petersen C.M. Nielsen M.S. Nykjar A. Jacobsen L. Tommerup N. Rasmussen H.H. Roigaard H. Gliemann J. Madsen P. Moestrup S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3599-3605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). The rat tissues expressing sortilin were determined by Northern blot using human (not shown) and rat sortilin cDNA (Fig.2 A) giving identical results. Sortilin is highly expressed in lung, fat, and brain and to a lesser extent in muscle and heart and is practically absent from liver. During 3T3-L1 adipocyte differentiation, sortilin is not expressed in the preadipocytes but is dramatically induced during differentiation of these cells, along with Glut4 (Fig. 2 B). Similar results were obtained with several lines of differentiating myoblasts (not shown). One of the sequenced peptides, namely the 16-mer NECSLHIHASISISQK (peptide 2 in Fig. 1), was synthesized in vitro, coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin, and used as an antigen for immunization of two rabbits. As shown in Fig. 3, these antisera recognize a protein in Glut4-immunoadsorbed vesicles ofM r 110,000. As a function of time of insulin exposure, this protein is depleted from Glut4-containing vesicles to the same extent as Glut4 (Fig. 3). This result is consistent with our earlier data showing insulin-dependent translocation of gp110/sortilin from Glut4 vesicles to the plasma membrane obtained using the independent technique of cell surface biotinylation (5Kandror K.V. Pilch P.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 138-142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, we were unable to directly confirm sortilin translocation by blotting plasma membrane and light microsome fractions from insulin-treated and untreated adipocytes, the protocol we have previously used with IRAP (gp160) (17Kandror K.V. Pilch P.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8017-8021Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) and the IGF-II/Man-6-P receptor (8Kandror K.V. Pilch P.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21703-21708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The most likely reason for this is that our antisera give a high nonspecific background and a low specific signal when used with crude membrane fractions (data not shown), whereas when we use affinity purified GLUT4 vesicles (Fig. 3) or if we partially purify detergent solublized adipocyte membrane glycoproteins on a lectin column, we detect a sortilin signal at M r 110,000 and little else (data not shown). We are in the process of raising new antisera to further explore sortilin trafficking in fat cells. During the course of our efforts to purify and clone gp110 from rat Glut4-containing vesicles, Petersen et al. (9Petersen C.M. Nielsen M.S. Nykjar A. Jacobsen L. Tommerup N. Rasmussen H.H. Roigaard H. Gliemann J. Madsen P. Moestrup S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3599-3605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar) described the purification from human brain and the cDNA cloning of what they called sortilin. As shown in Fig. 1, gp110 is rat sortilin. What then is sortilin, and what is it doing as a companion of Glut4? Sortilin is a novel type I receptor-like protein that has a significant homology in its extracellular/lumenal portion with the vacuolar sorting receptor from yeast Vps10p (18Marcusson E.G. Horazdovsky B.F. Cereghino J.L. Gharakhanian E. Emr S.D. Cell. 1994; 77: 579-586Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar), hence the name, sortilin. Interestingly, human sortilin has nine amino acids in its cytoplasmic tail identical to analogous regions of the cation-dependent Man-6-P receptor and the cation-independent IGF-II/Man-6-P receptors (9Petersen C.M. Nielsen M.S. Nykjar A. Jacobsen L. Tommerup N. Rasmussen H.H. Roigaard H. Gliemann J. Madsen P. Moestrup S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3599-3605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). This sequence contains well known targeting motifs, and therefore it is likely to be responsible for the co-localization of sortilin and the IGF-II/Man-6-P receptor in the same membrane compartments, including Glut4-containing vesicles (8Kandror K.V. Pilch P.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21703-21708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Because sortilin's extracellular domain suggests it may be a receptor of some kind, it is possible that it serves an analogous function to that of the mannose-6-phosphate receptor in fat cells. The latter protein may function in Glut4-containing vesicles to clear IGF-II from the circulation, and sortilin may serve to clear as yet unknown circulating protein(s)/ligands. A second possibility is that the presence of sortilin may be essential for the regulated translocation of Glut4-containing vesiclesvia its phosphorylation. Petersen et al. (9Petersen C.M. Nielsen M.S. Nykjar A. Jacobsen L. Tommerup N. Rasmussen H.H. Roigaard H. Gliemann J. Madsen P. Moestrup S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3599-3605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar) found a potential phosphorylation site in the cytoplasmic C-terminal portion of sortilin in the region of high homology with the cation-dependent and cation-independent Man-6-P receptors. We have recently shown that gp110 in Glut4-containing vesicles may indeed be phosphorylated by an unidentified vesicle-associated protein kinase in an insulin-dependent manner. 3K. V. Kandror and P. F. Pilch, unpublished data. Although the biological effect of this phosphorylation is not yet known, it may mediate interaction of sortilin with adaptor complex, as is the case with Man-6-P receptors (19Mauxion F. Borgne R.L. Munier-Lehmann H. Hoflack B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2171-2178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). A third possibility is that sortilin may be involved in the biogenesis of vesicles in which it resides. Sortilin was purified from brainvia its interaction with receptor-associated protein (RAP). RAP is a luminal protein of the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus with chaperone-like functions, and it interacts with a variety of receptors (20Willnow T.E. Armstrong S.A. Hammer R.E. Herz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4537-4541Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 21Bu G. Geuse H. Strous G.J. Schwartz A.L. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2269-2280Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). The ability of sortilin to interact with RAP (9Petersen C.M. Nielsen M.S. Nykjar A. Jacobsen L. Tommerup N. Rasmussen H.H. Roigaard H. Gliemann J. Madsen P. Moestrup S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3599-3605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar) suggests that RAP may play a role in the formation and functioning of Glut4-containing vesicles in insulin-sensitive fat and skeletal muscle cells. This remains to be determined, and RAP has never been studied in these cell types or with this perspective. If RAP has some particular role in fat cells, it is more likely in biogenesis of Glut4-containing vesicles rather than in regulation of their translocation. Obviously, a more defined role in biology for sortilin awaits its more detailed study, particularly with regard to the identification of a putative ligand. Because it is very abundant in the brain, it will be intriguing to explore localization of this protein in this tissue and, more specifically, its potential presence in synaptic vesicles. Our preliminary data (not shown) suggest that this indeed may be the case. If so, this will provide another interesting parallel between the molecular composition and functioning of Glut4-containing and synaptic vesicles and may shed light on the biological role of sortilin."

https://openalex.org/W2129751025,"Coagulation factor VIII (FVIII) and factor V are homologous glycoproteins that have a domain structure of A1-A2-B-A3-C1-C2. FVIII is a heterodimer of the heavy chain (domains A1-A2-B) and the light chain (domains A3-C1-C2) in a metal ion-dependent association between the A1- and A3-domains. Previous studies identified a 110-amino acid region within the FVIII A1-domain that inhibits its secretion and contains multiple short peptide sequences that have potential to bind immunoglobulin-binding protein (BiP). FVIII secretion requires high levels of intracellular ATP, consistent with an ATP-dependent release from BiP. Site-directed mutagenesis was used to elucidate the importance of the potential BiP-binding sites in FVIII secretion. Mutation of Phe at position 309 to Ser or Ala enhanced the secretion of functional FVIII and reduced its ATP dependence. The F309S FVIII had a specific activity, thrombin activation profile, and heat inactivation properties similar to those of wild-type FVIII. However, F309S FVIII displayed increased sensitivity to EDTA-mediated inactivation that is known to occur through metal ion chelation-induced dissociation of the heavy and light chains of FVIII. The results support that Phe309 is important in high affinity heavy and light chain interaction, and this correlates with a high affinity BiP-binding site.

Two structurally related plasma glycoproteins, coagulation factor VIII (FVIII) 1The abbreviations used are: FVIII, factor VIII; CCCP, carbonyl-cyanide 3-chlorophenylhydrazone; FV, factor V; BiP, immunoglobulin-binding protein; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; APTT, activated partial thromboplastin time; PCR, polymerase chain reaction. and factor V (FV), are essential cofactors for the proteolytic activation of factor X and prothrombin, respectively. FVIII and FV have similar domain structures of A1-A2-B-A3-C1-C2 (1Toole J.J. Knopf J.L. Wozney J.M. Sultzman L.A. Bucker R.L. Pittman D.D. Kaufman R.J. Brown E. Shoemaker C. Orr E.C. Amphlett G.W.

Upon transit through the secretory compartment, FVIII is processed to a heterodimer consisting of a carboxyl-terminal derived light chain of 80 kDa (domains A3-C1-C2) in a metal ion-dependent association with an amino-terminal derived 200-kDa heavy chain (domains A1-A2-B) (5Kaufman R.J. Wasley L.C. Dorner A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6352-6362Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). FVIII is inefficiently secreted, and this correlates with its interaction with the protein chaperone immunoglobulin-binding protein (BiP), also known as the glucose-regulated protein of 78 kDa (GRP78) (6Munro S. Pelham H.R.B. Cell. 1986; 46: 291-300Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1059) Google Scholar, 7Dorner A.J. Wasley L.C. Kaufman R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 20602-20607Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). BiP is a peptide-dependent ATPase that interacts with unfolded, mutant, or unassembled protein subunits within the ER (8Flynn G.C. Chappell T.G. Rothman J.E. Science. 1989; 245: 385-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar). FVIII release from BiP requires high intracellular concentrations of ATP. Depletion of intracellular ATP by treatment with low concentrations of the protonophore carbonyl cyanide 3-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP) specifically inhibited FVIII secretion, whereas secretion of FV was not affected (9Dorner A.J. Wasley L.C. Kaufman R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 7429-7432Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 10Pittman D.D. Tomkinson K.N. Kaufman R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17329-17337Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Further studies demonstrated that FVIII secretion requires not only high intracellular ATP level but also the ATPase activity of BiP (11Morris J.A. Dorner A.J. Edwards C.A. Hendershot L.M. Kaufman R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4327-4334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Previous studies using chimeric FVIII and FV cDNA molecules identified a 110-amino acid region within the FVIII A1-domain that either actively retains FVIII in the ER or alters protein folding to reduce FVIII secretion (12Marquette K.A. Pittman D.D. Kaufman R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10297-10303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Exchange of this region with the homologous residues in FV yielded an efficiently secreted FVIII/FV chimeric protein that was not active and for which the heavy and light chains were dissociated. Based on the ability of 7-mer peptides displayed in filamentous phage to bind BiP, Gething and co-workers devised a statistical method to predict the BiP binding potential of a particular 7-mer peptide (13Blond-Elguindi S. Cwirla S.E. Dower W.J. Lipshutz R.J. Sprang S.R. Sambrook J.F. Gething M.J. Cell. 1993; 75: 717-728Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar). Within the 110-amino acid region that inhibits FVIII secretion a hydrophobic cluster of residues from Ile291 to Phe309contains multiple 7-mer peptides having a high probability of binding BiP (12Marquette K.A. Pittman D.D. Kaufman R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10297-10303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). We tested the role of these residues in FVIII secretion by their mutagenesis to the respective amino acid present in FV. Mutation of a single amino acid Phe309 was sufficient to increase the secretion efficiency of biologically active FVIII by severalfold and reduce its ATP dependence for transport out of the cell. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed by oligonucleotide overlap extension polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Partially complementary primers that contained the mutation were utilized with two primers directed at the MluI sites at 226 and 336 in the FVIII/FV chimeric cDNA V(227–336) previously described (12Marquette K.A. Pittman D.D. Kaufman R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10297-10303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) to amplify two overlapping products that contain the directed mutation. Then these two fragments were isolated and fused together by PCR using the two MluI site containing primers. The resultant MluI fragment was then subcloned into theMluI-digested FVIII/FV 226–336 chimera within the expression vector pEDΔC (14Kaufman R.J. Davies M.V. Wasley L.C. Michnick D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 4485-4490Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). All mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing over the PCR-amplified region using the Sequenase kit (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). For every mutation analyzed, two independently isolated mutant clones were analyzed in transfection experiments. Expression vectors encoding the indicated mutants were transfected into COS-1 cells by the DEAE-dextran procedure (15Kaufman R.J. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 185: 487-511Crossref Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Conditioned medium was harvested 60 h post-transfection in the presence of 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum for FVIII assay. Protein synthesis and secretion were analyzed at 60 h post-transfection by pulse-chase labeling of cells (16Pittman D.D. Kaufman R.J. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 222: 236-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions and visualized by autoradiography after treatment with En3Hance (DuPont Corp., Boston, MA). Band intensities were quantitated with NIH image software. The full-length chimeric FVIII F309S cDNA contained in the expression vector pEDΔC was linearized by digestion with NheI and introduced into dihydrofolate reductase-deficient CHO cells by lipofection (16Pittman D.D. Kaufman R.J. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 222: 236-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Clones were isolated by growth in nucleoside-free medium and propagated in increasing concentrations of methotrexate as described (17Kaufman R.J. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 185: 537-566Crossref Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Clone D56 selected in 1 μm methotrexate secreted approximately 1 unit/ml/106 cells/day and was chosen for further study. Logarithmically growing CHO cells stably expressing either F309S or wild-type FVIII were fed medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. FVIII was purified from 200 ml of conditioned medium by immunoaffinity chromatography as described (18Michnick D.A. Pittman D.D. Wise R.J. Kaufman R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20095-20102Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The proteins eluted into the ethylene glycol-containing buffer were dialyzed and concentrated against a polyethylene glycol (molecular weight, ∼15–20,000)-containing buffer (19Fay P.J. Beattie T.L. Regan L.M. O'Brien L.M. Kaufman R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6027-6032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) and stored at −70 °C. FVIII activity in conditioned medium samples was measured using a chromogenic factor Xa generation assay from Pharmacia Hepar (Franklin, OH). FVIII activity of purified FVIII samples was measured by a one-stage APTT clotting assay by reconstitution of human FVIII-deficient plasma (George B. King, Biomedical Inc., Overland Park, KS). For thrombin activation, protein samples were diluted into 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm CaCl2, and 5% glycerol and incubated at room temperature with 1 unit/ml thrombin. After incubation for increasing periods of time, aliquots were diluted and assayed for FVIII activity. For heat or EDT inactivation, FVIII samples were maintained at 50 °C or in 10 mm EDTA at room temperature, and FVIII activity was determined after increasing periods of time by the one-stage clotting assay. One unit of FVIII activity is the amount measured in 1 ml of normal human pooled plasma. FVIII antigen was quantified using a sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay method utilizing anti-light chain antibodies ESH-4 and ESH-8 (American Diagnostica, Greenwich, CT) (20Zatloukal K. Cotten M. Berger M. Schmidt W. Wagner E. Birnstiel M.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5148-5152Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Purified recombinant FVIII protein was used as a standard. Residues 226–336 within the FVIII A1-domain contains a hydrophobic cluster where 7 of 11 amino acid residues are Leu or Phe between residues Leu299and Phe309. To identify whether this region may inhibit FVIII secretion, we mutated hydrophobic residues in this potential BiP-binding site. Transfection of COS-1 cells with vectors encoding FVIII molecules containing all Leu and Phe residues in the potential BiP-binding pocket mutated to Ala (7LF-A) or to their respective residues in FV (11VIII-V or 8VIII-V) did not yield activity in the conditioned medium (Table I), and this correlated with the absence of detectable protein secreted into the conditioned medium (data not shown). Subsequently, the Phe and Leu residues were individually mutated to the respective homologous amino acid residues in FV. The activity of the F309S mutant was reproducibly increased 2.3-fold in several transfection experiments (Table I). The increased activity of the F309S mutant correlated with a corresponding increase in FVIII antigen in at least five separate transfection experiments with two different independently isolated mutant clones, indicating a specific activity similar to wild-type FVIII. Mutation F309A also improved recovery of FVIII in the conditioned medium, indicating that the improved secretion was not selective to the F309S mutation. However, mutation of F309E reduced activity by 30%, which correlated with a 3-fold reduced secretion (data not shown), indicating specificity for the increase in activity that may be limited to small uncharged residues. In contrast, mutation at adjacent Phe or Leu residues had either little effect on (F306W and L299T) or significantly inhibited recovery of (F293S, L294T, and L300V) functional FVIII activity in the conditioned medium. Finally, mutation of C310S, a cysteine that is not disulfide-bonded and is a potential ligand for copper ion within the type I copper-binding site in the A1-domain, dramatically reduced recovery of activity in the conditioned medium.Table IMutagenesis of potential BiP binding site291 310FVIII ITFLTAQTLLMDLGQFLLFCActivity %FV ATSTTANMTVGPEGKWIISSwild typeMutations that inhibit secretion 7LF-AAA A AAAA<1 11VIII-VMTVGPE KWIIS<1 8VIII-VGPE KWIIS<1 F293SS<1 L294TT24 L300VV2.5 F309EE30 C310S S<1Mutations with no effect on secretion F306W W100 L299T T150Mutations that improve secretion F309SS230 F309AA208 L303E/F309S E S300 Q305K/F309S K S211 F306W/F309S W S225 L307I/F309S I S150 L308I/F309S IS173Effect of L303E/F309S on secretion defective mutants L294T/L303E/F309ST E S100 L300V/L303E/F309SV E S40 F293S/L303E/F309SS E S<1Plasmid DNA encoding each mutant was transfected into COS-1 cells, and FVIII activity in the conditioned medium was assay at 60 h post-transfection.

Several of the mutants (F309S, K303E/F309S, Q305E/F309S, and F309A) were transfected at least three times, and the variation between transfections compared with the wild-type FVIII was less than 10%. The results presented are from one experiment where cells were also pulse-chase labeled for analysis of FVIII secretion (Fig. 1). Open table in a new tab Plasmid DNA encoding each mutant was transfected into COS-1 cells, and FVIII activity in the conditioned medium was assay at 60 h post-transfection. Each transfection was performed with two independently isolated clones, and the average is represented as a percentage of wild type within the same experiment. Several of the mutants (F309S, K303E/F309S, Q305E/F309S, and F309A) were transfected at least three times, and the variation between transfections compared with the wild-type FVIII was less than 10%. The results presented are from one experiment where cells were also pulse-chase labeled for analysis of FVIII secretion (Fig. 1). We then tested whether insertion of additional mutations may further increase FVIII activity detected in the conditioned medium. Because the optimal peptide size for BiP binding is a 7-mer (11Morris J.A. Dorner A.J. Edwards C.A. Hendershot L.M. Kaufman R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4327-4334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar), we additionally mutated each of the residues in the hydrophobic pocket adjacent to F309S. The amount of secreted activity for each double mutant was close to that obtained with the F309S mutation alone (Table I). The only double mutant that yielded a slight increase over the F309S mutation alone was the F309S/L303E double mutation (3.0-fold greater than wild type in three separate experiments), which corresponds to a doubly modified 7-mer peptide. Finally, we tested whether introduction of the mutations that improve FVIII secretion could rescue the secretion of other FVIII mutations that destroyed activity recovered in the conditioned medium. Addition of the F309S/L303E double mutation to either the L294T or the L300V mutation increased their secretion close to the FVIII wild-type level (Table I). In contrast, addition of the F309S/L303E mutants into the F293S mutant did not improve secretion. These results show that the F309S/L303E mutations can increase secretion of some but not all secretion defective mutants of FVIII. Metabolic pulse-chase labeling was performed to characterize whether the increased activity correlated with an increase in synthesis, secretion, or specific activity. Analysis of the pulse-labeled and chase cell extract samples indicated that FVIII wild type and all mutants were synthesized at the same rate and disappeared from the cell extract at similar rates (Fig. 1 A). However, analysis of the conditioned medium demonstrated that the F309S mutation increased the recovery of FVIII in the conditioned medium (Fig. 1 B). Immunoprecipitation with the anti-heavy chain monoclonal antibody co-precipitated the light chain for all the mutants, demonstrating an association between the heavy and light chains. Additionally, the amount of F309S mutant FVIII recovered in the conditioned medium was similar to the amount of the FVIII-FV hybrid V(227–336) (Fig.1 B, lane 1). In contrast, secretion of F306W mutant FVIII was not different from the wild-type FVIII. The relative amount of secreted FVIII protein observed correlated with the amount of activity recovered in the conditioned medium (compare Table I with Fig.1 B). Mutation of L294T inhibited FVIII secretion, in proportion to the reduced activity (Table I), and additional mutation of L303E and F309S improved secretion of the mutant FVIII to a level similar to that of wild type (Fig. 1 C). Importantly, because wild type and all mutants were synthesized at the same rate, differences in transfection efficiency or expression cannot account for the differences in the amount of secreted protein recovered in the conditioned medium. These results demonstrate that the increased activity for all FVIII molecules harboring the F309S mutation resulted from increased secretion compared with wild-type FVIII. The increased secretion was almost equal to that of the FVIII-FV hybrid molecule V(227–336). To characterize the secretion of the F309S mutant FVIII in more detail, stably transfected CHO cell lines were derived that express the hybrid FVIII-FV V(227–336) protein or the F309S mutant FVIII. Of 35 original transfected CHO cell clones selected for dihydrofolate reductase expression, we obtained five clones that express significant levels of F309S FVIII (greater than 1 unit/ml/106 cells/day). Two of these clones express greater levels of FVIII compared with the original 10A1 cell line that was obtained by screening over 1000 original transfected cell clones (5Kaufman R.J. Wasley L.C. Dorner A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6352-6362Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, at this initial stage of selection in low concentrations of methotrexate, the F309S mutation permits high level FVIII expression to be obtained more readily. Pulse-chase labeling with [35S]methionine and immunoprecipitation with anti-FVIII antibody demonstrated that FVIII wild type, V(227–336), and F309S mutant FVIII molecules were synthesized and secreted from CHO cells at similar rates with no significant difference in BiP association (data not shown). To further characterize the BiP interaction we analyzed the effect of ATP depletion on the transport of FVIII wild type, V(227–336), and F309S mutant FVIII from CHO cells. Cells were pulse-labeled with [35S]methionine and chased for 6 h in the presence of increasing concentrations of CCCP. Cell extracts were harvested and immunoprecipitated with anti-FVIII or anti-FV antibody for analysis by SDS-PAGE. Whereas transport of the majority of wild-type FVIII was inhibited by 10 μm CCCP, FV required higher concentrations to significantly inhibit transport. The V(227–336) hybrid molecule also required high levels of CCCP (250 μm) to inhibit its transport (Fig.2). The single point mutant F309S displayed an ATP dependence that was intermediate between wild-type FVIII and FV. These results are consistent with the interpretation that the F309S mutant FVIII binds BiP but with an apparent lesser affinity and that this interaction does not require high levels of ATP for release. The properties of the F309S mutant FVIII were studied by purification of this mutant from conditioned medium from CHO cells. Wild-type FVIII was purified in parallel for control. The specific activity determined by the factor Xa generation assay and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay of wild-type and F309S FVIII were not significantly different (approximately 2500 units/mg). F309S mutant FVIII displayed a thrombin activation very similar to that of wild-type FVIII (Fig. 3 A). The thermal stabilities of wild-type and F309S FVIII, tested by treating the purified proteins at 50 °C for increasing periods of time, were similar (Fig. 3 B). However, F309S FVIII was inactivated by EDTA treatment at an approximately 10-fold greater rate than wild-type FVIII (Fig. 3 C). These results show that F309S mutation did not alter FVIII specific activity, thrombin activation, or thermal inactivation. However, this mutation did significantly increase the sensitivity to EDTA-induced inactivation. Analysis of expression of FVIII, FV, and deletion and chimeric proteins demonstrated that sequences within the carboxyl-terminal half of the A1-domain in FVIII inhibit secretion (12Marquette K.A. Pittman D.D. Kaufman R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10297-10303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). This region is also required for heavy and light chain association and contains a hydrophobic pocket having peptide sequences that have the potential to bind BiP. Mutagenesis of a single amino acid residue, Phe309, improved FVIII secretion to a level comparable with that of the FVIII/FV chimeric protein V(227–336). In addition, the secretion of the resultant molecule displayed a reduced requirement for ATP, following reduction of intracellular ATP levels by treatment of cells with the protonophore CCCP. We interpret these findings in either one of two ways. First, the Phe309 mutant FVIII may exhibit a weaker interaction for BiP, and its release may therefore require fewer molecules of ATP. Alternatively, the mutant molecule may exhibit improved folding properties so that it more quickly attains its final conformation required for transport from the cell and therefore is bound to BiP for a lesser period of time. Dramatically, introduction of the F309S mutation into FVIII molecules that were defective for secretion was able to rescue their secretion defect. This suggests that hemophilia A associated with mutations that reduce FVIII secretion may be improved by introduction of the F309S mutation into the FVIII gene in these patients. The F309S mutant FVIII was characterized to exhibit thrombin activation and thermal lability indistinguishable from wild-type FVIII. However, the molecule did exhibit a 10-fold increased sensitivity to EDTA-induced inactivation. EDTA is known to inactivate FVIII through chelation of a metal ion that is required for association of the A1-domain in the heavy chain with the A3-domain in the light chain. FVIII contains 1 mol of copper/mole of protein, and copper ion is only detected when the heavy chain is associated with the light chain (21Bihoreau N. Pin S. de Kersabiec A.-M. Vidot F. Fontaine-Aupart M.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 220: 41-48Crossref Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Mutation of C310S in wild-type FVIII produced an inactive molecule in which the heavy and light chains were dissociated (22 ). The requirement for Cys310 in FVIII and its absence in FV indicate that the requirements for folding and final structures of these two homologous molecules may be distinctively different. It is intriquing that F309S is adjacent to a ligand in the type I copper-binding site that may be essential for copper ion-dependent A1- and A3-domain interaction. Recently, a structural model of the FVIII A-domains was proposed based on the recently elucidated structure of ceruloplasmin (23Zaitseva I. Zaitsev V. Card K.M. Bax B. Ralph A. Lindley P. Bioinorg. Chem. 1996; 1: 15-23Google Scholar, 24Pemberton S. Lindley P. Zaitsev V. Card G. Tuddenham E.G.D. Blood. 1997; 89: 2413-2421Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The proposed structure places the phenyl side chain of Phe3093.7 Å from Phe536 in the A2-domain, suggesting a potential hydrophobic interaction between the A1- and A2-domains. If this model is correct, mutation of F309S should weaken the A1- and A2-domain interaction. Our experimental data on the characterization of the F309S mutant FVIII show that thrombin inactivation kinetics are similar for wild-type and F309S mutant FVIII. Because inactivation of thrombin-activated FVIII occurs as a consequence of A2-domain dissociation (25Lollar P. Parker C.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 267: 23652-23657Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar), our experimental evidence does not suggest a weakened interaction between the A1- and A2-domains. Further experimental evidence should elucidate the validity of the structural model."

Neuron. 1996; 17: 575-578Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). Among various protein domains of MAGUKs, the PDZ domain has been a focus of intense scrutiny (5Marfatia S.M. Cabral J.H.M. Lin L. Hough C. Bryant P.J. Stolz L. Chishti A.H. J.

Sci. 1996; 21: 455-458Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Like the SH2 and SH3 domains, the PDZ domains recruit cytoplasmic proteins to specific submembranous sites. For example, the PDZ1 + 2 domain, but not the PDZ3 domain, of PSD-95 and hDlg interacts with the carboxyl terminus of the NMDA receptors and the Shaker type K+ channels, and this interaction plays an important role in the clustering of ion channels (5Marfatia S.M.

Neuron. 1996; 17: 575-578Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). The PDZ domains have also been shown to interact with other PDZ domains. The PDZ domain of neuronal nitric-oxide synthase binds to the PDZ domain of syntrophin at the sarcolemma in skeletal muscle and to the PDZ2 domain of PSD-95 at the synaptic junctions of neuronal cells (9Brenman J.E. Chao D.S. Gee S.H. McGee A.W. Craven S.E. Santillano D.R. Wu Z. Huang F. Xia H. Peters M.F. Froehner S.C. Bredt D.S.

Cell. 1995; 82: 743-752Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (840) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that the primary structures of both the PDZ domain and its target peptide govern the specificity as well as the affinity of PDZ domain-mediated interactions in vitro and in vivo. The three-dimensional structure of PDZ3 domains in PSD-95 and hDlg (11Doyle D.A. Lee A. Lewis J. Kim E. Sheng M. MacKinnon R. Cell. 1996; 85: 1067-1076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (958) Google Scholar, 12Cabral J.H.M. Petosa C. Sutcliffe M.J. Raza S. Byron O. Poy F. Marfatia S.M. Chishti A.H. Liddington R.C. Nature. 1996; 382: 649-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar), together with our understanding of the peptide binding specificities of PDZ domains (13Songyang Z. Fanning A.S. Fu J. Xu J. Marfatia S.M. Chishti A.H. Crompton A. Chan A.C. Anderson J.M. Cantley L.C. Science. 1997; 275: 73-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (1212) Google Scholar), reveals that the specificity of PDZ domain recognition is indeed dependent upon the primary sequence of the PDZ domain and its cognate ligand.The biochemical interactions of p55 protein have been well studied in the red cell membrane. We have previously shown that p55 directly binds to protein 4.1 and glycophorin C and may form a ternary complex with these proteins at the cytoplasmic face of the plasma membrane (14Marfatia S.M. Lue R.A. Branton D. Chishti A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8631-8634Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This ternary complex links the spectrin-actin junctions to the lipid bilayer and is presumed to play an important role in maintaining erythrocyte shape and its membrane material properties (15Chasis J.A. Mohandas N. Blood. 1992; 80: 1869-1879Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Hemming N.J. Anstee D.J. Staricoff M.A. Tanner M.J.A. Mohandas N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5360-5366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). To delineate the basis of p55 interactions with protein 4.1 and glycophorin C, we have mapped the binding interfaces between protein 4.1 and p55 as well as between protein 4.1 and glycophorin C (17Marfatia S.M. Lue R.A. Branton D. Chishti A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 715-719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). However, the site where the cytoplasmic domain of glycophorin C binds to p55 had not yet been determined. In this paper, we show that the single copy of the PDZ domain in human erythrocyte p55 binds to the carboxyl-terminal 12 amino acids of glycophorin C. The carboxyl terminus YFI motif of glycophorin C is the critical binding element for PDZ domain-mediated interaction. The interaction between p55 and glycophorin C appears to be specific, since the PDZ domains of hDlg fail to bind glycophorin C. These findings indicate that the PDZ domains are novel protein modules that target cytoplasmic proteins to the multiprotein complexes at the inner surface of the plasma membrane.RESULTSWe have previously shown that erythrocyte membrane protein p55 binds to the cytoplasmic domain of glycophorin C (14Marfatia S.M. Lue R.A. Branton D. Chishti A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8631-8634Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To determine the specific binding site on p55, we expressed the glycophorin C cytoplasmic domain and defined segments of human erythrocyte p55 as recombinant GST fusion proteins in bacteria. The cytoplasmic domain of glycophorin C was cleaved from GST by thrombin and was further purified by size exclusion chromatography. For convenience, we will refer to the GST fusion protein containing the cytoplasmic domain of glycophorin C as GST-GPC82–128. The purified cytoplasmic domain of glycophorin C without GST will be designated GPC82–128. The molecular mass predicted from the primary structure of GPC82–128 is 5.3 kDa. As shown in Fig. 1 A, >90% of the GPC82–128 protein migrated as a 12-kDa species on a Superdex-75 gel filtration column. Although only about 10% of the GPC82–128 aggregated at 7.0 mg/ml protein concentration, no 5.3-kDa species of GPC82–128 protein was detected within the range of protein concentration examined in this study (Fig.1 A). In addition, the gel-filtered GPC82–128protein migrated as an ∼11-kDa species on the SDS-polyacrylamide gels in the presence of 2-mercaptoethanol (Fig. 1 B, lane 2), indicating that the bacterially expressed cytoplasmic domain of glycophorin C may form a noncovalent dimer. This result is, however, in contrast to previously published studies indicating that GPC exists as a monomer in the red cell membrane (24Reid M.E. Chasis J.A. Mohandas N. Blood. 1987; 69: 1068-1072Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Chang S. Reid M.E. Conboy J. Kan Y.W. Mohandas N. Blood. 1991; 77: 644-648Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).To resolve this issue, the aggregation state of GPC82–128protein was analyzed using a MALDI mass spectrometer. As shown in Fig.1 C, purified GPC82–128 protein exists largely as a monomer in solution constituting 70–90% of the total peak area (5575.25 Da). A dimeric peak corresponding to 10–20% of the total protein was also detected (11136.6 Da; Fig. 1 C). To test whether purified GPC82–128 protein migrates as a monomer in a modified gel electrophoresis system, we analyzed GPC82–128 by Tricine-containing SDS-polyacrylamide gels. The Tricine-containing gels are known to achieve higher resolution of proteins in the lower molecular mass range of 4–40 kDa (27Schagger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10439) Google Scholar). Again, the GPC82–128 protein migrated as a diffuse band of ∼11 kDa (Fig. 1 C, inset, lane 1). At higher amounts of GPC82–128 protein, a diffuse but relatively weaker band of ∼5 kDa was also detected (Fig.1 C, inset, lane 2,arrowhead).In view of the conflicting results obtained by gel filtration/electrophoresis and MALDI, we reevaluated the self-association state of purified GPC82–128 by sedimentation equilibrium analysis. The solute distribution data were fitted with the exponential form of the solution to the Lamm equation for a single ideal species (22Lamm O. Arkiv. Mat. Astron. Fys. 1929; 21B: 1-4Google Scholar) (see “Experimental Procedures” for details). Using this model, a good fit yielded an apparent whole cell weight average molecular mass of 4340 ± 230 Da, which is in close agreement with the calculated monomeric mass (5297 Da) of GPC82–128 protein (Table I). This result is consistent with the value obtained by MALDI, which shows that GPC82–128 exists as a monomer in solution. Here, the potential to draw erroneous conclusions by using only gel filtration and gel electrophoresis techniques is evident.Table ISedimentation equilibrium analysis of the recombinant cytoplasmic domain of glycophorin C[GPC] (A 280)m, app (base line = 0)Errorm, app (base line floated)ErrorBase line (if m = 5297 Da)DaDaDaDa0.054446522440672020.0050.104406415743261670.0120.4204639584839600.0110.6134010674123690.0420.5634824314641290.0350.6414533564204460.0650.9284563534210430.072The data were fitted with the ASSOC4 model in the XL-A ORIGIN software package to obtain the apparent whole cell weight average mass (m, app). First, the optical base-line offset was set to 0 (assuming that dialysis had equalized the contribution of absorbing, nonsedimenting species at 280 nm). The mass was then floated, and the fits were good (yielding 4010 Da ≤ m, app ≤ 4830 Da), indicating the soundness of using this model. Then the base line was floated together with the mass (yielding 4070 Da ≤ m, app ≤ 4840 Da). Finally, in order to assess the effect of poorly mismatched base lines, the mass was set to 5297 Da (the mass calculated from the amino acid sequence), and the baselines were floated. Again, good fits were obtained. Extrapolation of the concentration dependence of apparent mass to infinite dilution yielded a mass of 4340 ± 230 Da. Open table in a new tab The GST-p55 fusion proteins were examined for glycophorin C binding activity using a blot overlay assay. The fusion proteins were first immobilized onto nitrocellulose and then incubated with the purified cytoplasmic domain of glycophorin C. The bound GPC82–128was detected immunologically using antibodies specific for the cytoplasmic domain of glycophorin C. As shown in Fig.2, GPC82–128 binding occurred only with GST-p55 fusion proteins containing the PDZ domain, namely 1) full-length p55, 2) N-terminal domain + PDZ domain, and 3) N-terminal domain + PDZ domain + SH3 motif. Neither the N-terminal domain nor the SH3 motif alone bound GPC82–128. Similarly, GPC82–128 did not bind a construct containing only the guanylate kinase domain. A construct containing the guanylate kinase domain, the tyrosine phosphorylation domain (TP), the protein 4.1 binding domain (4.1B), and the SH3 motif of p55 also did not show any glycophorin C binding activity. By process of elimination, the single copy of the PDZ domain in p55 appears to contain the binding site for the cytoplasmic domain of glycophorin C.Figure 2Localization of the glycophorin C binding site on erythrocyte p55.

Lue R.A. Branton D. Chishti A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8631-8634Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we inferred that the p55 binding site is located within the carboxyl half of the cytoplasmic domain of glycophorin C. Indeed, peptide P24 bound to the GST-p55 fusion proteins containing the PDZ domain in a blot overlay assay (data not shown). To measure the direct binding of P24 to the p55 PDZ domain, a GST-PDZ fusion protein was expressed in bacteria. The binding was quantified using the surface plasmon resonance technique (BIAcore). The biotinylated P24was immobilized to the streptavidin surface of the Biosensor SA chip. The GST-p55 fusion proteins containing either the N-terminal and PDZ domains or the PDZ domain alone (Fig. 2 A) bound to P24, whereas no binding occurred between P24and the GST-N-terminal domain (Fig.3 A). Moreover, the binding of P24 to GST-PDZ was completely abrogated when 21 amino acids (amino acids 62–82) were deleted from the N terminus of the PDZ domain leaving a truncated PDZ domain (PDZΔ) (Figs. 2 A and3 A). Therefore, the N-terminal 21 residues of the PDZ domain are essential for the interaction of p55 with the cytoplasmic domain of glycophorin C. These observations are consistent with the x-ray crystallographic structure of the PDZ3 domains of hDlg and PSD-95, which shows that the amino-terminal region of the PDZ domain makes specific contact with the carboxyl-terminal end of the bound peptide and hence is important in stabilizing the PDZ domain-peptide interactions (11Doyle D.A.

A, responses in RU are plotted as a function of time (sensorgrams). GST fusion proteins of p55 were injected at a concentration of 410 μg/ml over immobilized, wild-type peptide P24 of glycophorin C. A total of 403 RU of peptide P24 was immobilized on the streptavidin surface of sensor chip SA. Binding was performed at a flow rate of 5 μl/min, 25 °C. No interaction was observed with the N-terminal domain or truncated PDZ domain of p55, even at double the concentration. B, wild type and three mutant peptides were immobilized on the streptavidin surface of four flow cells on the same sensor chip. Approximately 370 RU of each peptide were immobilized. The GST-PDZ domain fusion protein at 410 μg/ml concentration was injected over the four flow cells.C, kinetic analysis of the interaction between p55 PDZ domain and immobilized peptide P24 of GPC. The overlay plot showing specific association and dissociation phase was generated by increasing the concentration of the GST-PDZ domain fusion protein. A total of 414 RU of peptide P24 was immobilized on the streptavidin surface, and binding was carried out at a flow rate of 3 μl/min at 25 °C. A plot of dR/dt versus Rwas used to analyze the association phase. The dissociation phase was followed for 25 min; the rate of dissociation was higher initially and then slowed. This could result from either analyte rebinding to the immobilized ligand or the dimerization of GST fusion protein (5Marfatia S.M. Cabral J.H.M. Lin L. Hough C. Bryant P.J. Stolz L. Chishti A.H. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 753-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). A plot of ln(R 1/R n)versus time was used for dissociation phase analysis. A 20–60-s time frame on the plot was selected for calculating the apparent dissociation rate constant (k d) for each concentration. k d = 10.2 ± 0.11 × 10−4 s−1, obtained for the highest concentration (21.5 μm), was used to calculate the dissociation constant (K D). The apparent association rate constant (k a) obtained was 231.5 ± 67m−1 s−1, and the dissociation constant (K D) was 4.4 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To identify the minimum segment of glycophorin C required to bind p55, a peptide corresponding to the carboxyl-terminal 12 amino acids of glycophorin C (Asp-117 to Ile-128) was synthesized (see “Experimental Procedures”). This peptide, designated YFI, was conjugated to biotin via its N terminus. Peptide YFI was immobilized on the streptavidin surface of an SA sensor chip, and was then tested for binding to the PDZ domain of p55 using BIAcore. Again, both fusion proteins, GST-N-terminal plus PDZ domain and GST-PDZ domain, bound to peptide YFI (Fig. 3 B). As expected, no binding was detected with either GST-N-terminal domain or GST-PDZΔ fusion protein (data not shown). These results indicate that the carboxyl-terminal 12 amino acids of glycophorin C are sufficient for its binding to the PDZ domain of p55. The binding capacity of peptide YFI for the PDZ domain is, however, lower than that of peptide P24 (compare the RU values of bound GST-PDZ in Fig. 3, A and B). The relatively weaker binding of the 12-amino acid peptide may result from poor flexibility due to immobilization on the chip surface.We have recently reported that PDZ domains can be classified into two subgroups based on their ability to recognize amino acids located at the carboxyl-terminal −2 position of interacting proteins (13Songyang Z. Fanning A.S. Fu J. Xu J. Marfatia S.M. Chishti A.H. Crompton A. Chan A.C. Anderson J.M. Cantley L.C. Science. 1997; 275: 73-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (1212) Google Scholar). Group I PDZ domains select residues with a hydroxyl side chain (Ser/Thr) at the −2-position, while group II PDZ domains select residues with an aromatic side chain (Tyr/Phe) at the −2 position. Both classes of PDZ domains prefer hydrophobic amino acids at the 0 position of interacting peptides. Using an alanine scan, we examined the role of the glycophorin C carboxyl-terminal YFI motif in p55 PDZ domain binding. We produced mutant peptides by selectively replacing the Tyr and Ile residues of the YFI motif (see “Experimental Procedures”); peptide YFA replaced Ile-128; peptide AFI replaced Tyr-126; and peptide AFA replaced both Ile-128 and Tyr-126. All peptides were conjugated to biotin at their amino termini, immobilized on the streptavidin surface of the SA sensor chip, and tested for GST-PDZ domain binding activity. As shown in Fig.3 B, the GST-PDZ domain bound only to peptide YFI and not to any mutant peptides, illustrating that amino acids Tyr-126 and Ile-128 at the carboxyl terminus of glycophorin C are critical for its binding to the PDZ domain of p55.For the initial attempt to quantify the interaction between the p55 PDZ domain and glycophorin C, we used the 12-amino acid YFI peptide. It should be noted that the determination of kinetic parameters by BIAcore requires regeneration of the sensor chip surface. This process removes bound analyte without affecting the immobilized ligand, so that the interaction of a fixed amount of ligand can be measured with increasing concentrations of the analyte. For unknown reasons, the bound PDZ domain on the YFI peptide-coated sensor chip could not be removed quantitatively. Application of harsher regeneration conditions resulted not only in the removal of bound PDZ domain but also of immobilized YFI peptide. Hence, we selected peptide P24 to quantify the affinity of glycophorin C for the PDZ domain of p55. Peptide P24 (414 RU) was immobilized on the SA chip and introduced to five different concentrations of the GST-PDZ domain (1.2–21.5 μm) (Fig. 3 C). Analysis of the resulting sensorgrams gave an apparent association rate constant (k a) of 231.5 ± 67m−1 s−1 and an apparent dissociation rate constant (k d) of 10.2 ± 0.11 × 10−4 s−1. The apparent dissociation constant K D = 4.4 μm was calculated from the ratio k d/k a.

A GST fusion protein containing all the three PDZ domains of lymphocyte hDlg was produced (5Marfatia S.M. Cabral J.H.M. Lin L. Hough C. Bryant P.J. Stolz L. Chishti A.H. J.

Using the blot overlay assay, no binding of GPC82–128 was observed with either the three PDZ domains of hDlg or the full-length hDlg protein (data not shown). To supplement these in vitro results, we utilized red cell membranes of individuals with complete glycophorin C deficiency (Leach phenotype) (23Chishti A. Palek J. Fisher D. Maalouf G.J. Liu S-H.

Using an affinity-purified antibody against lymphoid hDlg, a comparable amount of hDlg protein was detected in the normal and glycophorin C-deficient red cell membranes (Fig. 5). These results confirm that the YFI signature at the carboxyl terminus of glycophorin C determines its specificity for the PDZ domain of p55.Figure 5Detection of hDlg in the membranes of Leach phenotype red blood cells.

Steady state kinetic studies were carried out under mixed micellar conditions using a novel continuous coupled assay system. The kinetic data were consistent with a random equilibrium mechanism, implying that diacylglycerol kinase catalyzes direct phosphoryl transfer from MgATP to diacylglycerol. This was supported by failure to detect an enzyme-phosphate covalent intermediate and by the observation that the bisubstrate analog adenosine 5′-tetraphosphoryl-3-O-(1,2-dihexanoyl)-sn-glycerol inhibits the enzyme (K i ≪K m,DAG). While diacylglycerol kinase'sk cat/K m is modest compared with the efficiency of many water-soluble enzymes, the enzyme nevertheless appears to be an evolutionarily optimized biocatalyst in the sense that its chemical reaction rate approaches the substrate diffusion-controlled limit. The in vivo rate-limiting step of DAGK's reaction appears to be, in part, the transbilayer diffusion of diacylglycerol from the outer leaflet to the inner leaflet of the cytoplasmic membrane where DAGK's active site is located.

Escherichia coli diacylglycerol kinase (DAGK) 1The abbreviations used are: DAGK, diacylglycerol kinase; DAG, sn-1,2-diacylglycerol; DM, β-decyl maltoside; OG, β-octyl glucoside; DMPC, dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine; DHG,sn-1,2-dihexanoylglycerol; PBBG, 1-pyrenebutyryl-2-butyrl-sn-glycerol; DHPA,sn-1,2-dihexanoylphosphatidic acid; DMF, dimethylformamide; MDO, membrane-derived oligosaccharides; PG, phosphatidylglycerol; PIPES, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid. represents a family of prokaryotic DAGKs that play an important role in microbial physiology under conditions of environmental stress (1Kennedy E.P. Neidhardt F.C. Escherichia coli and Salmonella, Cellular and Molecular Biology. 2nd Ed. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.1996: 1064-1071Google Scholar, 2Yamashita Y. Takehara T. Kuramitsu H.K. J.

DAGK is also important because it plays a central technological role in the most commonly used assay for diacylglycerol in biological extracts (4Preiss J. Loomis C.R. Bishop W.R. Stein R. Niedel J.E. Bell R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 8597-8600Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). DAGK is structurally distinct from other kinases. It is a homotrimer (5Vinogradova O. Badola P. Czerski L. Sonnichsen F. Sanders C.R. Biophys. J. 1996; 72: 2688-2701Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (64) Google Scholar), has virtually no detectable sequence homology to other kinases, and lacks sequence motifs typically present in enzymes catalyzing phosphoryl transfer (6Smith C.A. Rayment I. Biophys. J. 1996; 70: 1590-1602Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar,7Schaap D. van der Wal J. van Blitterswijk W.J. Biochem. J. 1994; 304: 661-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). With a molecular mass of only 13 kDa, DAGK is easily the smallest known kinase. DAGK is an integral membrane protein with at least 50% of its sequence being located within the lipid bilayer (Fig.1). The reaction catalyzed by DAGK is unique by virtue of its phase heterogeneity; ATP is water-soluble while DAG is a bilayer-associated lipid. Kinetic studies carried out in the laboratories of R. Bell and H. Sandermann have established that DAGK can be subjected to detailed mechanistic characterization in mixed micelles (8Walsh J.P. Bell R.M J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 15062-15069Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Walsh J.P. Bell R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 6239-6247Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Russ E. Kaiser U. Sandermann H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 171: 335-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 11Bohnenberger E. Sandermann H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 132: 645-650Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Their work has provided a phenomenological characterization of DAGK's apparent activation by metal ions and phospholipids. The Bell laboratory also examined DAGK's diacylglycerol substrate specificity in elegant detail (12Walsh J.P. Fahrner L. Bell R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 4374-4381Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this report, we present additional kinetic studies that resolve the previously unaddressed question of whether DAGK catalyzes direct phosphoryl transfer or employs an enzyme-phosphate intermediate. The new kinetic data also allow us to examine the question of whether or not DAGK is an evolutionarily optimized biocatalyst in the sense that it can catalyze its reaction near the substrate diffusion-controlled rate limit (13Albery W.J. Knowles J.R. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 1977; 16: 285-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). In addition, DAGK's nucleotide substrate specificity is scrutinized in this study. DAGK, in which the N-terminal Met residue has been replaced with a MGHHHHHHEL “poly(His)” sequence tag, was purified from a high level overexpressing strain of E. coli using nickel ion chelate chromatography as described previously (14Sanders C.R. Czerski L. Vinogradova O. Badola P. Song D. Smith S.O. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8610-8618Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). For the studies of this work the final purification step was elution of pure DAGK from the Ni(II)-agarose (Qiagen, Chatworth, CA) column using a 1% β-decyl maltoside (DM) solution containing 0.4 m NH4OH. DAGK is completely stable for several hours in such a solution. The DAGK pool was then frozen in liquid nitrogen and lyophilized to remove the ammonia and to yield an easily handled DAGK-DM powder which is typically about one-third by weight DAGK. Lyophilization of DAGK in a DM solution has been found to result in little or no loss of DAGK activity upon redissolution. For kinetic studies 0.3–30 mg/ml stock DAGK solutions were made by dissolving the DAGK-DM powder in assay buffer (see below). DAGK concentration was assessed by measuring solution absorbance at 280 nm (ε1 mg/ml = 2.1 for DAGK). DM is the detergent of choice for the stock DAGK solutions because DAGK is completely stable for several days in DM solutions at room temperature. The DM and β-octyl glucoside used in our studies were ultrapure and were purchased from Anatrace (Maumee, OH). For routine assays and for the kinetic studies DAGK was assayed by enzymatically coupling its reaction to NADH oxidation, a process conveniently followed in a continuous mode by monitoring assay solution absorbance at 340 nm and 30 °C. Routine assays were initiated by adding DAGK to assay mixtures containing pH 6.8 buffer (60 mm PIPES, 50 mm LiCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA), 60 mmβ-octyl glucoside (OG), 7 mmdimyristoylphosphatidylcholine (DMPC), 1 mmphosphoenolpyruvate, 3 mm ATP, 2.6 mm sn-1,2-dihexanoylglycerol, 20 mmMg2+ (acetate salt used), 0.25 mm NADH, and 20 units each of lactic dehydrogenase and pyruvate kinase (from a glycerol-containing stock). Because the critical micelle concentration of OG is ∼22 mm, the micellar OG concentration is 38 mm. Thus, the two lipid components of the assay mixture, DMPC and DHG, are present at levels of about 20 and 7.5 mol %, respectively. Reactions were carried out in 1-cm, 1.5-ml quartz cuvettes in temperature-controlled sample cells within a Hewlett Packard (Palo Alto, CA) model 8452 ultraviolet/visible spectrophotometer. For rate calculations the extinction coefficient of NADH at 340 nm was taken to be 6110 absorbance units/(cm·m). Under these “standard” assay conditions, DAGK activity was normally observed to be about 22 units/mg, where 1 unit is defined as 1 μmol of DHG phosphorylated per min. DHG was synthesized in our laboratory (procedure available upon request), although it is now commercially available. DMPC was purchased from Princeton Lipids (Princeton, NJ). For steady state kinetic studies the following modifications were made to the standard assay: the PIPES concentration was somewhat higher (75 mm), the Mg2+ concentration was slightly higher (20 mm), DMPC was replaced by 8 mol % (relative to micellar OG) cardiolipin (beef heart mitochondrial, Avanti Polar Lipids, Alabaster, Alabama), and the ATP and DHG concentrations were variable. Reactions involving ATP analogs were not run using the coupled assay system because of the potential complication that some analogs might be poor substrates for pyruvate kinase, such that the rate of the coupling enzyme could become partially rate-limiting. In these cases, an assay in which pyrene-tagged DAG (1-pyrenebutyryl-2-butyrl-sn-glycerol, PBBG) served as the substrate for DAGK. At various time points during the reaction, aliquots were quenched, and the pyrene-tagged product phosphatidic acid was separated from PBBG using TLC. TLC plates were then subjected to ultraviolet light, and the conversion of substrate to product was quantified via densitometric analysis of the fluorescent spots on the TLC plates. This assay has been described in detail previously (14Sanders C.R. Czerski L. Vinogradova O. Badola P. Song D. Smith S.O. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8610-8618Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). For the studies of this report, TLC assay conditions were 24 ± 3 °C, pH 6.8, 60 mm PIPES, 50 mm LiCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm EGTA, 20 mmMg2+, 21 mm DM (19 mm micellar), 5 mm DMPC, 1.25 mm PBBG, and 1–20 mmATP (or other triphosphate). When the triphosphate concentration was greater than 5 mm, the Mg2+ concentration was set to be equal to [triphosphate] + 20 mm. The synthesis of this bisubstrate analog involved phosphoester condensation of ATP with activated dihexanoyl phosphatidic acid (DHPA, see Fig.2). DHPA was synthesized from DHG by reaction with POCl3, subsequent hydrolysis, and purification by flash chromatography using 70:30:3:1 CHCl3:methanol:water:acetic acid. The R Fof DHPA in this solvent system is ∼0.45. DHPA was converted to an organic-soluble salt by dissolving 0.26 mmol in 2 ml of dimethylformamide and adding 0.62 mmol of tri-n-butylamine, followed by solvent removal using rotary evaporation. The residue was subjected to redissolution in 3 ml of DMF and rotary evaporation three times. The tributylammonium salt of DHPA formed in this manner (0.62 mmol) was redissolved by 4 ml of DMF, and to this were added 1.4 mmol of carbonyldiimidazole (Sigma) to activate DHPA for ester condensation. The mixture was allowed to stir at 25 °C for 2 h followed by heating at 40 °C for 1 h. Finally, 62 μl of methanol were added to consume unreacted carbonyldiimidazole, and the mixture was stirred for another hour at room temperature before repeated cycles of solvent removal using rotary evaporation followed by redissolution of the DHPA-imidazolamide in dimethylformamide. Adenosine triphosphate (0.32 mmol) was converted to its pyridinium salt form using Dowex 50W-X8 and then into its tri-n-butylammonium form by dissolution in DMF followed by addition of a 4.2 molar excess of tributylamine. Following repeated redissolution in DMF and rotary evaporation, the ATP was taken up into 3 ml of DMF and added to the 0.26 mmol of DHPA-imidazolamide, also in 3 ml of DMF, and stirred under argon. After 40 h at room temperature, no sign of desired product could be detected by TLC (5:2:3 1-butanol:acetic acid:water). The reaction was then warmed to 45 °C and allowed to proceed for 12 h, at which point a highR F (0.57) UV-absorbing spot was observed to be present with an intensity greater than that of the ATP precursor (R F near 0). The reaction mixture was then rotary-evaporated and flash-chromatographed (5:2:3 1-butanol:acetic acid:water). The major product pool was rotary-evaporated to yield 0.26 g of a yellow oil. The product exhibited anR F of 0.22 in 5:2:1:2 1-butanol:water:acetic acid:ethyl ether and was flash-chromatographed using this solvent system. This time it was possible to resolve the “major product” into two major species (“high” and “medium”R F products) and one minor product (lowest of the three in R F terms), all with R Fvalues near 0.22. Following drying of the pools by rotary evaporation, medium R F product weighed 33 mg. This oil was next dissolved by an 1-propanol/water mixture and passed over 1-ml Dowex 50W-X8 (Na+ form) columns, followed by rotary evaporation to yield a white solid. The identity of this products as an ATP-DAG conjugate where adenosine is 5′-linked to dihexanoylglycerol through a tetraphosphoryl linkage was supported by 1H and31P NMR. However, fast atom bombardment mass spectroscopy carried out at the NIH Mass Spectrometry Facility at Michigan State University indicated an apparent molecular weight of 821 rather than the expected 857. Thus, it is possible that the inhibitor characterized in this study is not exactly that depicted in Fig. 1, but is instead a related bisubstrate analog. This ambiguity does not alter the interpretation of the data described under “Results.” DAGK reaction rates measured in studies where both DAG and MgATP concentrations were varied were fit by the steady state kinetic model for a two-substrate random equilibrium enzyme (15Segel I.H. Enzyme Kinetics. John Wiley & Sons, New York1975: 273-285Google Scholar),Rate=Vmax·[DAG]·[ATP]α·Km,ATP·Km,DAG+α·Km,ATP·[DAG]+α·Km,DAG·[ATP]+[ATP]·[DAG]Equation 1 where α is the factor by which the K m of MgATP and DAG are attenuated by prior association of the other substrate. Data were fit by this equation using a nonlinear least squares routine within the program MINSQ-II, with weighting of the data proportional to rate (Micromath Software, Salt Lake City, UT). Because DAGK kinetic studies were carried out in a mixed micellar medium (see above and “Results”) and involve a lipid substrate and an integral membrane protein appropriate use of Equation 1 (and Equation 2 below) requires that the K m of the lipid substrate be expressed in mole fraction units (16Carman G.M. Deems R.A. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18711-18714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Furthermore, appropriate use of these equations is based upon the assumption that the rate of intermicellar diffusion for lipid substrates is not rate-limiting to the enzymic reaction. For DAGK in mixed micelles involving the detergent β-octyl glucoside and short-tailed forms of diacylglycerol such as DHG, this assumption has been carefully examined and unambiguously demonstrated to hold (9Walsh J.P. Bell R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 6239-6247Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Reaction rates determined in the presence of the ATP-DAG bisubstrate analog were fit by a random equilibrium-derived model (15Segel I.H. Enzyme Kinetics. John Wiley & Sons, New York1975: 273-285Google Scholar) which assumes: (i) that the analog is competitive with both substrates, (ii) that binding of the analog to the completely free enzyme is much tighter than to either binary complex or to the ternary complex (so that only the dissociation constant for the analog to the free enzyme needs to be treated), and (iii) the degree of synergism between substrates is negligible (α = 1.0 in Equation 1).Rate=Vmax·([ATP]·[DAG]/Km,ATP·Km,DAG)1+[ATP]/Km,ATP+[DAG]/Km,DAG+[I]/KI+([ATP]·[DAG]/Km,ATP·Km,DAG+[I]·[DAG]/KI·Km,DAGEquation 2 Because DAGK is an integral membrane protein and because one of its substrates is a lipid, previous kinetic studies of DAGK have relied upon the use of mixed micelles as a means to solubilize the enzyme and DAG. Extensive justification has previously been presented regarding the validity of using mixed micelles to mimic the lipid bilayer for detailed kinetic study of DAGK (8Walsh J.P. Bell R.M J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 15062-15069Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Walsh J.P. Bell R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 6239-6247Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (also see “Materials and Methods”) and other membrane enzymes (16Carman G.M. Deems R.A. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18711-18714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). A limited number of DAGK assays have also been carried out in bilayers, which suggest that DAGK's activity in vesicles is similar to its activity in mixed micelles at similar levels of substrates (14Sanders C.R. Czerski L. Vinogradova O. Badola P. Song D. Smith S.O. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8610-8618Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The studies of this report were greatly facilitated by integrating the central aspects of the mixed micellar DAGK assay system developed by Bell and his co-workers (17Walsh J.P. Bell R.M. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 209: 153-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) with a classical kinase assay wherein substrate phosphorylation is coupled to UV absorbance-detectable NADH oxidation via the mediation of pyruvate kinase and lactic dehydrogenase (18Rhoads D.G. Lowenstein J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 3963-3972Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This new assay method is much easier than the existing assay methods (11Bohnenberger E. Sandermann H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 132: 645-650Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 17Walsh J.P. Bell R.M. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 209: 153-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) and also provides a continuous means for monitoring the DAGK reaction. In developing this assay several observations were made. First, the measured rates for a given set of assay conditions were linear with the quantity of DAGK added to the assay, as expected. Secondly, the slopes of theA 340 versus time plots were linear following sample mixing until nearly all of the NADH had been consumed. Finally, provided that lactic dehydrogenase and pyruvate kinase are present at levels of ≥10 units per 1-ml assay, the measured rates are independent of the level of the coupling enzymes. The key to the success of this assay system is the apparent tolerance of lactate dehydrogenase and pyruvate kinase to high levels of octyl glucoside. A very fundamental question with regard to the mechanism of any kinase is whether it catalyzes phosphoryl transfer via a directsubstrate to acceptor pathway or whether it first catalyzes formation of an enzyme-phosphate intermediate followed by a second transfer of the phosphoryl from enzyme to acceptor. In general, a mechanism involving a covalent enzyme-phosphate complex is expected to be reflected by ping-pong kinetic behavior where both substrates are not bound at the same time. The direct transfer mechanism would be expected to display “random equilibrium” or “ordered” kinetic patterns, in either case involving formation of an enzyme-MgATP-DAG ternary complex. We carried out kinetics where the concentrations of both substrates were varied systematically. The data were fit by the random equilibrium kinetic model (in direct form, see “Materials and Methods”), the results of which were used to generate the double reciprocal plots shown in Fig. 3.V max was determined to be 50 ± 7 units/mg, corresponding to a k cat of 12 s−1, based on one active site per DAGK monomer (5Vinogradova O. Badola P. Czerski L. Sonnichsen F. Sanders C.R. Biophys. J. 1996; 72: 2688-2701Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (64) Google Scholar).K m,MgATP was determined to be 1.2 ± 0.5 mm, and K m,DAG is 5.0 ± 2.2 mol %. The substrate cooperativity factor, α, was calculated to be 0.48 ± 0.17, indicative of a modest degree of positive cooperativity between the two substrates. Similar results were obtained if other data weighting schemes were used (see “Materials and Methods”) or if α was assumed to be 1.0. The α·K m determined for MgATP and DHG of 0.58 ± 0.25 mm and 2.4 ± 1 mol % are in agreement with apparent K m previously determined for each substrate in the presence of saturating levels of the other substrate (0.3 mm for MgATP and 2.4 mol % for DHG) (9Walsh J.P. Bell R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 6239-6247Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Walsh J.P. Fahrner L. Bell R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 4374-4381Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The trueV max determined in the present work is a little higher than the apparent V max determined previously (28 units/mg) (12Walsh J.P. Fahrner L. Bell R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 4374-4381Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The data appear to be reasonably well fit by the random equilibrium model and are clearly not consistent with ordered or ping-pong mechanisms, as can be qualitatively discerned in Fig. 3. This result supports the notion that either MgATP or DAG can bind to the enzyme in both the presence and absence of the other substrate and that the reaction likely proceeds through a direct MgATP to DAG transfer pathway. If DAGK catalyzes direct phosphoryl transfer from MgATP to DAG, then the binding sites for these two substrates should be proximal and oriented so that the γ-phosphoryl of ATP is appropriately placed for transfer to thesn-3 oxygen of DAG. In this case, as been demonstrated for a number of water-soluble kinases (19Broom A.D. J. Med. Chem. 1989; 32: 2-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 20Feldhaus P. Frohlich Goody R.S.

Soc. 1994; 116: 9413-9418Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar), a bisubstrate analog in which ATP is covalently linked to DAG through a polyphosphate bridge may be an inhibitor of the enzyme. For a number of kinases, analogs in which there are four bridging phosphodiesters have been observed to be better inhibitors than the true bisubstrate analogs with only three (20Feldhaus P. Frohlich Goody R.S. Isakov M. Schirmer R.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1975; 57: 197-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 21Ikeda S. Chakravarty R. Ives D.H. J. Biol.

Soc. 1994; 116: 9413-9418Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar), probably because most kinase-active sites involve a spatially distal reaction pathway such that catalysis in the ternary complex occurs only upon a transient conformational change bringing the donor phosphomonoester in reactive proximity with the acceptor moiety (23Andersson C.M. Zucker F.H. Steitz T.A. Science. 1979; 235: 569-571Google Scholar,24Schulz G.E. Muller C.W. Diederichs K. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 213: 627-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). The extra phosphate in the n = 4 analogs permits both active sites to be filled in the ternary “ground state” structure. Based on these considerations we synthesized a tetraphosphate-linked ATP-DAG conjugate whose structure is similar or identical to that depicted in Fig. 2 (see “Materials and Methods”). A series of 10 rates were measured where the apparent concentration of the inhibitor was varied from 5 to 100 μm (0.01 to 0.26 mol %), ATP was varied from 0.16 to 0.94 mm, and DHG was varied from 0.4 to 3.1 mol %. As described under “Materials and Methods,” these data were fit by a model that assumes the inhibitor to be competitive against both substrates (as expected for bisubstrate inhibition (25Lienhard G.E. Secemski I.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 1121-1123Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Purich D.L. Fromm H.J. Biochem. Biophys. Acta. 1972; 276: 563-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). A variety of different fits were attempted in which, variously, the K m for the two substrates were either allowed to vary or were fixed to their predetermined values. Because, under the conditions of the mixed micellar assay, effectively all of the ATP-DAG bisubstrate analog will be associated with the mixed micelles (27Sanders C.R. Schwonek J.P. Biophys. J. 1993; 65: 1207-1218Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), mole fraction units were used to expressK I in these calculations. In all cases, theK I inevitably was determined to be in the 0.03–0.06 mol % range. For the specific fit where V maxand K m were fixed to values determined in the studies of the previous section, a K I of 0.036 ± 0.01 mol % was determined, about two orders of magnitude lower thanK m,DAG. It should be noted that when the above calculations were repeated using molar units to express the inhibitor concentration, an apparent K Iwas calculated to be in the 10–21 micromolar range, well below the MgATP's K m. These results demonstrate that the tetraphosphate-linked ATP-DAG bisubstrate analog is a reasonably good inhibitor of DAGK. These inhibition results reinforce the interpretation of the steady state kinetic data that DAGK catalysis occurs via direct phosphoryl transfer from MgATP to proximally associated DAG. To provide final confirmation that the DAGK reaction does not involve an enzyme-phosphate intermediate, two additional experiments were carried out to attempt detection of a phosphoenzyme intermediate. First, pure DAGK was bound through its poly(His) tag to Ni(II)-agarose resin and bathed in a mixed micellar solution in which the enzyme is fully active followed by exposure to saturating levels of MgATP. The on-resin enzyme was then washed extensively using the same mixed micellar solution in the absence of ATP. Equivalents of 0.3 of PBBG (relative to the moles of bound DAGK) were then passed through the column and collected. Possible phosphorylation of the fluorescently tagged of the DAG was then assayed using the thin layer chromatography DAGK assay method (see “Materials and Methods”) and using a highly sensitive chemical assay to see if any conversion to phosphatidic acid occurred when DAG passed through the column. Within the limits of detection by these methods (which could detect an ∼1% conversion of PBBG to product), no phosphatidic acid product could be detected. A control experiment in which PBBG was passed through the DAGK column in the presence of MgATP yielded >50% conversion to phosphatidic acid. Since ATP hydrolysis by DAGK is slow (hours) on the time scale it took to run these experiments (minutes), these results provide no evidence for the presence of a DAGK-phosphate intermediate that could react with PBBG in the absence of nucleotide. In a second series of experiments, DAGK bound to the Ni(II)-resin was exposed under standard mixed micellar assay conditions to 5 mm MgATP and then washed with ATP-free solution, conditions in which an enzyme-phosphate intermediate would be expected to persist if present. The column was then extracted with 1% decyl maltoside containing 2% formic acid to release the DAGK and any associated phosphate. This resulting solution was then ashed and tested for the presence of phosphate using the method of Van Veldhoven and Mannaerts (28Van Veldhoven P.P. Mannaerts G.P. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 161: 45-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar). Within the limits of detection (sensitive enough to detect a 1% population of phosphorylated DAGK within the total DAGK population), no phosphate could be detected. This result provides additional confirmation that the DAGK reaction does not involve a covalent intermediate. The nucleotide specificity of the DAGK reaction was investigated using the TLC/fluorescent assay system to measure reaction rates at four to eight concentrations of each MgATP analog examined. Both adenosine tetraphosphate and adenosine diphosphate were tested as alternate substrates for DAGK's forward reaction. MgADP is a very poor phosphoryl donor (TableI), exhibiting a >105reduction in V max relative to MgATP.

It has been implicated in a variety of events in neurons, ranging from the neurotransmitter synthesis and release, modulation of neurotransmitter receptors and ionic channels, and gene expression to several aspects of synaptic plasticity such as the prevailing model for memory called long term potentiation as well as spatial learning (1Hanson P.I. Schulman H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 559-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar, 2Miyamoto E. Fukunaga K. Neurosci. Res. 1996; 24: 117-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 3Soderling T.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1297: 131-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 4Tan S.-E. Liang K.-C. Brain Res. 1996; 711: 234-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The distinctive property of CaMK2 is that the Ca2+/calmodulin-activated enzyme rapidly autophosphorylates, thereby generating a constitutively active, phosphorylated Ca2+-independent kinase that phosphorylates multiple substrates at presynaptic and postsynaptic sites. Studies have shown that certain neurotransmitters are of critical importance in the modulation of this activation reaction (2Miyamoto E. Fukunaga K. Neurosci. Res. 1996; 24: 117-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). However, whether activation of CaMK2 can be due to other signaling factors still remains unclear. In addition to the characteristic trophic and phenotypic effects of trophic factors, it has been recently shown that neurotrophins strongly enhance synaptic efficacy. For example, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) induces an increase of synaptic transmission in rat hippocampal cultures and slices (5Kang H.J. Schulman E.M. J. Physiol. Paris. 1995; 89: 11-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 6Levine E.S. Dreyfus C.F. Black I.B. Plummer M.R. Mol. Brain Res. 1996; 38: 300-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Furthermore, consistent with BDNF knockout studies (7Patterson S.L. Abel T. Deuel T.A.S. Martin K.C. Rose J.C. Kandel E.R. Neuron. 1996; 16: 1137-1145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1038) Google Scholar), a critical level of BDNF activity was found to be important for long term potentiation in hippocampus (8Figurov A. Pozzo-Miller L.D. Olafsson P. Wang T. Lu B. Nature. 1996; 381: 706-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (956) Google Scholar). However, little is known about how the neurotrophins might modulate synaptic plasticity. It is therefore of great interest to examine whether CaMK2 might be also capable of orchestrating these trophic responses. Here, we have investigated the effects of BDNF on the Ca2+-dependent CaMK2 activity in hippocampal slices of adult rat. The materials and reagents were obtained as follows: [γ-32P]ATP and ECL Western blotting analysis system, Amersham International; KN-62, D609, U73122, A23187, and calyculin A, LC Laboratories; protein phosphatase 1, Boehringer Mannheim; autocamtide-2 and monoclonal antibody (IgG1) to phosphothreonine, Biomol Research Laboratories, Inc.; BDNF, Alomone Laboratories, Ltd; polyclonal antibodies specific for the α- and β-subunits of CaMK2 (anti-CaMK2α and anti-CaMK2β), Santa Cruz Biotech. Inc; normal mouse IgG, Caltag Laboratories; Mini-Protean 2 Electrophoresis and Trans-blot semi-dry transfer cells, Bio-Rad Laboratories; and P-81 phosphocellulose filters, Whatman International, Ltd. All other chemicals were purchased from Sigma. Transverse hippocampal slices (500 μm) were prepared from adult male CD rats (200–250 g) and submerged in 1 ml of continuously oxygenationed (95% O2/5% CO2) Ringer's solution at 30 °C for 1 h. For each tested point, five slices were removed and incubated at 30 °C for the indicated times into a glass tube containing 1 ml of continuously oxygenationed Ringer's solution and test drugs. Afterward, slices were homogenized in 1 ml of ice-cold homogenization buffer by 20 strokes of a hand-held glass Teflon homogenizer, and homogenates were stirred for 1 h at 4 °C and then centrifuged two times at 12,000 × g for 15 min to remove nonsolubilized material. The homogenization buffer consisted of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.3, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 0.2% Triton X-100, 50 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 25 mm NaF, 15 mmNa4P2O7, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, and 100 μg/ml benzidine. Protein content of homogenates was determined as described in Ref. 9Blanquet P.R. Croquet F. J. Cell Physiol. 1995; 165: 358-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar. When analyzing the effects of insolubilized alkaline phosphatase (APP) on CaMK2, cytosolic extracts were prepared exactly as described above, except that they were dialyzed against 50 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm Cl2Mn, pH 7.3, and were then adjusted to pH 8. CaMK2 was treated with insolubilized APP in 200 μl of cytosolic extracts as described (10Ackerman P. Osheroff N. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 11958-11965Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and APP was then removed by centrifugation prior to assays for CaMK2 activity. When CaMK2 was treated with protein phosphatase (PP1) in an immunocomplex, fractions (500 μl) of homogenates were precleared by adding 0.6 μg of normal mouse IgG together with 13 μl of protein A-agarose and were then incubated at 4 °C for 1 h with anti-CaMK2β (1:100 dilution). Protein A-agarose (20 μl) was added to samples, and the mixtures were rocked at 4 °C for 1 h. After that, the immunoprecipitates were washed three times with phosphatase buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaCl) and were incubated for 2 h at 30 °C in 50 μl of phosphatase buffer containing PP1 (10 milliunits), 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol and 1 mm MnCl2. Finally, the immunoprecipitates were washed twice with kinase buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 5 mm MgCl2) and resuspended in 20 μl of this buffer prior to assays for CaMK2 activity. Phosphorylation reactions were initiated by adding 20 μl (about 40 μg) of solubilized homogenate or 20 μl of resuspended CaMK2 immunoprecipitate to 235 μl of kinase buffer containing 2 mm CaCl2, 1 μm calmodulin (CaM), 20 μm ATP, 4 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (3,000 Ci/mmol), and autocamtide-2 at 40 μg/ml. To monitor Ca2+/CaM-independent activity of CaMK2, parallel tests were performed in the absence of Ca2+ and calmodulin and in the presence of 2 mm EGTA. All reactions were carried out for 3 min at 30 °C. Phosphorylation was then stopped either by spotting 50 μl of soluble mixtures on P-81 phosphocellulose filters or by sedimenting the immunocomplexes by centrifugation prior to addition of 50 μl of supernatants to filters. Filters were washed, and radioactivity was determined as described in Ref. 11Charriaut-Marlangue C. Otani S. Creuzet C. Ben-Ari Y. Loeb J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 10232-10236Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar. Each sample was analyzed in quadruplicate, averaged, and normalized to the control fractions. Differences between means of paired comparisons were evaluated by Student's t test. Ap value of < 0.05 was considered significant. CaMK2 was immunoprecipitated using anti-CaMK2α and anti-CaMK2β (1:100 dilution) as described above. The immobilized immunocomplexes were washed three times in buffered detergent solution (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and treated with SDS sample buffer as described in Ref. 9Blanquet P.R. Croquet F. J. Cell Physiol. 1995; 165: 358-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar. Supernatants were then run on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide minigels and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane using Mini-Protean 2 Electrophoresis and Trans-blot semi-dry transfer cells. Finally, filters were incubated at 4 °C overnight in TBS-T buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mmNaCl, 0.1% Tween 20) containing 2% bovine serum albumin, followed by incubation with primary antibody in TBS-T/4% bovine serum albumin for 2 h at room temperature, using anti-CaMK2α, anti-CaMK2β (1:1000 dilution), or the anti-phosphothreonine antibody (1:500 dilution). Filters were then washed six times for 5 min each in TBS-T, incubated for 1 h with anti-mouse IgG conjugated to peroxidase (1:1000 dilution) in TBS-T/4% bovine serum albumin, and washed again three times for 6 min each in TBS-T. Immunolabeled bands were detected using the ECL system. Autoradiograms were scanned with a BIOCOM COMPAQ computer. In the basal state, the average Ca2+/CaM-dependent CaMK2 activity with autocamtide-2 detected was 3.5 ± 1.2 nmol/mg/min. The average Ca2+/CaM-independent activity from the same control samples was 0.19 ± 0.07 nmol/mg/min. The ratio of Ca2+/Ca-independent activity to Ca2+/CaM-dependent activity in the basal state was about 5.5%, which is consistent with data reported by others (12Fukunaga K. Rich D.P. Soderling T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21830-21836Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,13Molloy S.S. Kennedy M.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 4756-4760Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Interestingly, treatment of slices with 50 ng/ml BDNF resulted in a 4-fold increase in the Ca2+/CaM-independent activity of CaMK2 (Fig. 1 A). This increase in activity was transient, being maximal within about 4 h and slowly decreasing by 6 h. In contrast, no significant stimulation in CaMK2 activity was observed when slices were treated with BDNF in the presence of KN62, a drug designed to inhibit autophosphorylation of CaMK2 (Fig. 1 A). Because BDNF rapidly activates its signaling pathways in hippocampal neurons through activation of the trkB receptor (14Marsh H.N. Palfrey H.C. J. Neurochem. 1996; 67: 952-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), the time of BDNF incubations (1–4 h) of slices necessary to enhance the activity level of CaMK2 left open the question of why activation took so long. We could not exclude the possibility that this increased CaMK2 activity might be due to increasing cellular concentration of the enzyme. To verify this hypothesis, an immunoblot procedure was employed to monitor the level of CaMK2 protein over a time course of BDNF action. CaMK2 was immunoprecipitated from extracts using anti-CaMK2α and anti-CaMK2β, and after separation on SDS-PAGE and transfer of proteins, blots were probed with either of these antibodies. Immunoblot analysis revealed that the levels of both α- and β-subunits were not substantially altered over this time course (Fig. 1 B). For example, quantification of immunostain bands indicated that immunoreactivity of α- and β-subunits at 4 h post-BDNF treatment was 95 ± 10.9 and 109 ± 12.7% of controls, respectively (values obtained from three experiments). In fact, recent studies have emphasized that immunochemical labeling for BDNF is only detectable in hippocampal slices after about 1 h and continues to increase gradually over several hours (7Patterson S.L. Abel T. Deuel T.A.S. Martin K.C. Rose J.C. Kandel E.R. Neuron. 1996; 16: 1137-1145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1038) Google Scholar). It seems likely, therefore, that the time observed here for the CaMK2 activation results from the time required for the penetration of BDNF into slices. It is clearly established that formation of the active Ca2+/CaM-independent form of CaMK2 is dependent on autophosphorylation of Thr-286/287 residues of the enzyme (α/β subunits, respectively) (15Schworer C. Colbran R.J. Keefer J.R. Soderling T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 13486-13489Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To address whether CaM-sensitive CaMK2 activation in response to BDNF also involved an autophosphorylation event, cytosolic extracts were treated with insolubilized APP. Following the removal of APP, extracts were then assayed for CaMK2 activity. As shown in Fig. 2 A, treatment with APP of extracts from BDNF-treated slices greatly depressed the CaMK2 activity. In contrast, no significant effect of phosphatase was observed when the APP inhibitors orthovanadate and EDTA were present. These results strongly suggested that activation of CaMK2 by BDNF resulted from autophosphorylation of the kinase. The relative levels of observed activities, however, could not be completely valid in crude extracts because autocamtide-2 may not be necessarily entirely specific for CaMK2 as a kinase substrate. To ensure that the level of CaMK2 activity strictly correlated with the level of Thr phosphorylation of the kinase, we performed control experiments in which both Thr phosphorylation and activity of CaMK2 were analyzed following treatment with PP1 of CaMK2β immunoprecipitates. To this end, Thr phosphorylation was evaluated by Western blotting, and activity was measured in an immunocomplex kinase assay. In accordance with our initial experiments, Thr phosphorylation was dramatically reduced and CaMK2 activity was substantially depressed in BDNF-stimulated extracts treated only with the phosphatase (Fig. 2,B and C). However, both phosphorylation and activity of CaMK2 were not significantly decreased when the extracts from BDNF-treated slices were incubated with PP1 in the presence of PP1 inhibitors okadaic acid or calyculin A (Fig. 2, B andC). Phospholipase C (PLC) was shown to bind specific phosphotyrosines in the trk receptors (16Obermeier A. Bradshaw R.A. Seedorf K. Choidas A. Schlessinger J. Ullrich A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1585-1590Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar), but it was still unclear whether this docking signal enzyme participated in signaling pathways of BDNF (14Marsh H.N. Palfrey H.C. J. Neurochem. 1996; 67: 952-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Of particuliar interest, therefore, was our observation that the selective PLC inhibitor D609 completely suppressed BDNF-induced CaMK2 activation (Fig. 1 A). A similar result was observed with the specific PLC inhibitor U73122 (5 μm) (data not shown). These results strongly suggested that BDNF-induced CaMK2 activation was dependent of PLC in hippocampus. Stimulation of PLC leads to the generation of inositol triphosphate, which is involved in Ca2+ mobilization from inositol triphosphate-sensitive stores. Furthermore, Ca2+ channels in hippocampal neurons are modulated by protein kinase C (17Swartz K.J. Merritt A. Bean B.P. Lovinger D.M. Nature. 1993; 361: 165-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar) and thereby might be related to PLC activation via the production of diacylglycerol. Because cytoplasmic elevation of Ca2+ level by BDNF in hippocampus has been described (18Berninger B. Garcia D.E. Inagaki N. Hahnel C. lindholm D. Neuroreport. 1993; 4: 1303-1306Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar), we were interested in whether the activation of CaMK2 by BDNF was mediated by the release of Ca2+ from the cytosolic stores or by the influx of Ca2+. After pre-exposure with BDNF, treatment of slices with BDNF in the presence of BAPTA-AM or TMB-8, two drugs commonly used as intracellular Ca2+ chelators, resulted in a dramatic decrease of BDNF-induced CaMK2 activity (Fig.3 A). In contrast, omission of extracellular Ca2+ or Ca2+ chelation by EGTA failed to depress this activity. In addition, treatment with the Ca2+ ionophore A23187 resulted in a marked stimulation of CaMK2 activity (Fig. 3 A). To determine how CaMK2 was inductibly phosphorylated on Thr sites after incubation of slices with the agents described above, CaMK2β immunoprecipitates were transferred to nitrocellulose filters and probed with the anti-phosphothreonine antibody. As shown in Fig. 3 B, Thr phosphorylation of CaMK2 was increased after BDNF treatment and did not appear to return toward the basal level in the presence of EGTA. In contrast, the effect of BDNF on Thr phosphorylation was abolished by D609 (data not shown) and markedly attenuated by BAPTA-AM (Fig.3 B). Collectively, therefore, the present results strongly suggest that the PLC-dependent release of Ca2+from intracellular inositol triphosphate-sensitive stores, rather than Ca2+ influx through Ca2+ channels, acts as a trigger for the Thr phosphorylation and the subsequent activation of CaMK2 in response to BDNF. Although the available evidence indicates an incomplete overlap between neurons producing BDNF, trkB, and CaMK2, these proteins appear to be synthesized primarily by granule and pyramidal neurons of rat hippocampus, i.e. the principal hippocampal cells (1Hanson P.I. Schulman H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 559-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar, 19Schmidt-Kastner R. Wetmore C. Olson L. Neuroscience. 1996; 74: 161-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Given that CaMK2, trkB, and the internal Ca2+ stores are found to be predominantly concentrated in the postsynaptic densities of rat neurons, it is tempting to speculate that the signaling pathway described here most likely occurs mainly in postsynaptic structures of principal hippocampal neurons (20Aronowski J. Grotta J.C. Brain Res. 1996; 709: 103-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 21Wu K. Xu J.-L. Suen P.-C. Levine E. Huang Y.-Y. Mount H.T.J. Lin S.-Y. Black I.B. Mol.

Recently, several studies reported that Ca2+-induced activation of CaMK2 evoked via synaptic activity may be involved in controlling the transcriptional activation of BDNF genes (23Tsuda M. Neurochem. Int. 1996; 29: 443-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Therefore, the crucial question to answer now is whether such a de novo synthesis of BDNF may potentiate activation of CaMK2 and thereby lead to self-controlled consolidation of synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus."
https://openalex.org/W2024178675,"In this study we have investigated the molecular mechanism by which sodium butyrate modulates gene expression when added to cultured cells. As a model system we used hepatoma tissue culture cells in which sodium butyrate treatment increases histone H1(0) mRNA level and decreases c-myc mRNA level. Because we observed that stimulation of histone H1(0) gene expression could take place in the absence of protein neosynthesis, we hypothesized that sodium butyrate induced a post-translational modification of a factor involved in the transcription process. Using different types of well known kinase and phosphatase inhibitors, we studied the implication of kinase or phosphatase activity in this pathway. Interestingly, cell treatment with potent serine-threonine-phosphatase inhibitors, calyculin A or okadaic acid, prevented the regulation of both histone H1(0) and c-myc gene expressions by sodium butyrate. On the other hand, the tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor, vanadate, or the protein kinase C inhibitor, staurosporine, did not significantly modify sodium butyrate effects. Using protein phosphatase 1 and 2A for in vitro assays, we found a 45% increase of phosphatase activity after cell treatment by sodium butyrate, possibly due to a protein phosphatase 1-type protein phosphatase. These data strongly suggest that signaling pathway(s) triggered by sodium butyrate to modulate gene expression involve(s) a serine-threonine-phosphatase activity."

By Far-Western blotting and yeast two-hybrid assay, we demonstrate that p45, the large subunit of NF-E2, is capable of binding to a specific set of WW domain-containing proteins, including the ubiquitin ligase hRPF1. This binding is mediated through the interaction between the WW domains and a PY motif located within the amino-terminal region of p45. Interestingly, the carboxyl-terminal domain of mammalian RNA polymerase II binds a similar set of WW domains to which p45 interacts with.

Orkin S.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4640-4647Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Most likely, NF-E2 functions through DNA binding as well as interactions with other cell type-specific and ubiquitous co-activators. For example, binding of p45 with hormone receptor(s) and CREB-binding protein (14Cheng X.B. Reginato M.J. Andrews N.C. Lazar M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1407-1416Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) potentiates transcriptional activation mediated by hormones. NF-E2 binding to its cognate sequence also induces local nucleosome disruption (15Gong Q.H. McDowell J.C. Dean A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6055-6064Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Armstrong J.A. Emerson B.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5634-5644Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The NH2-terminal region of p45 has been implicated as the transcriptional activation domain of NF-E2 (9Kotkow K.J. Orkin S.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4640-4647Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), and it contains 18% of proline residues. Interestingly, during data base search and visual comparison of the p45 sequence, we have noticed the sequence PPPPY located at amino acids 79–83 of human p45. In mouse, it is PPPSY. This sequence fits the consensus of the so-called “PY” motifs,XPPXY, in which P is a proline, Y is a tyrosine, and Xs are any amino acid (17, 18; Fig.1). The PY motifs are ligands capable of binding to the WW domains, which in turn were first identified in the proto-oncogene Yes-associated protein (YAP), 1The abbreviations used are: YAP, Yes kinase-associated protein; NEDD4, NPC-expressed, developmentally down-regulated 4; hRPF1, human receptor potentiation factor 1; GST, glutathione S-transferase; WBP1, WW domain-binding protein 1; GBD, Gal4 DNA binding domain; GAD, Gal4 activation domain; NIPP1, NF-E2-interacting polypeptide 1; CTD, COOH-terminal domain; pol, polymerase; RT-PCR, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. dystrophin, transcriptional regulator FE65, and others (19Sudol M.

These domains are of the length 38 amino acids, and they contain β strands grouped around four aromatic positions (17Sudol M. Trends Biochem.

Nature. 1996; 382: 646-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). Two of these positions are most frequently occupied by tryptophans, hence the name “WW” domain was given. The WW domains are found in a number of unrelated proteins, including human and mouse YAP (hYAP, mYAP), human dystrophin (hDys), human ORF1, yeast Rsp5, yeast Ess1 (yEss1), fission yeast Pub1, mouse NEDD4 (mNEDD4), human RPF1/NEDD4 (hRPF1), and FE65 (reviewed in Ref.17Sudol M.

Biol. 1996; 16: 2594-2605Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). As demonstrated below, p45 indeed could interact with several of these proteins, in vivo and in vitro, through specific interaction between the PY motif at amino acids 79–83 and the different WW domains. We also show that RNA pol II-CTD and p45 bind similar WW domains, including the mNEDD4-WW2. The study has suggested new pathways through which the processes of transcriptional activation by the NF-E2 molecule could be regulated in erythroid and megakaryote cells. p45 cDNA was amplified from K562 RNA by RT-PCR (27Kawasaki E.S. Innis M.A. Gelfand D.H. Sninsky J.J. White T.J. PCR Protocols: A Guide to Methods and Applications. Academic Press Inc., Orlando, FL1990: 21-27Google Scholar) with primers A and B and blunt-end-cloned into the AvaI site of pGEX-2T. To create mutations in the PY motif of p45, two fragments were first generated by PCR amplification of p45 cDNA with primer pairs B/C and A/D, respectively. These two fragments were then used as the templates for PCR with primers A and B. The final product, p45(P81A,Y83G), was blunt-end-cloned into theAvaI site of pGEX-2T. The p45 protein expressed from this plasmid contains two amino acid substitutions in the PY motif: Pro → Ala at 81 and Tyr → Gly at 83. Cloning of GST-WBP1-PY was described previously (18Chen H.I. Sudol M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7819-7823Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar). hYAP-WW, mYAP-WW1, mYAP-WW2, mNEDD4-WW1, mNEDD4-WW2, mNEDD4-WW3, yEss1-WW, and hDys-WW were individually PCR-amplified from the appropriate cDNAs with primer pairs E/F, G/H, I/J, K/L, M/N, O/P, Q/R, and S/T, respectively, and ligated at theBamHI-EcoRI sites of pGEX-2TK. Protein kinase A-phosphorylatable GST-CTD fusion protein was kindly provided by Michael E. Dahmus (University of California, Davis, CA). Sequences of all the primers (A–Z) used in this study are available upon request. Authenticity of the clones was confirmed by restriction enzyme digestion and DNA sequencing. p45 and p45(P81A,Y83G), respectively, were purified with GSH-agarose beads (Sigma) from isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside-induced extracts of Escherichia coli cells harboring the individual plasmids (28Smith D.B. Johnson K.S. Gene ( Amst .). 1988; 67: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (5046) Google Scholar). Different WW domains and WBP1-PY motif fusions were purified in a similar way. For preparation of32P-labeled probes, equal amounts of GST-p45- and GST-p45(P81A,Y83G)-bound glutathione-agarose were used in a 4 °C phosphorylation reaction with bovine heart muscle kinase (Sigma) and [γ-32P]ATP (29Kaelin W.G.

To prepare the blots, approximately 4 μg each of GST, or GST-WW fusion proteins, were electrophoresed on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were first blocked with GST-expressing E. coli extract in Hyb75 (29Kaelin W.G. Krek W. Sellers W.R. Decaprio J.A. Ajchenbaum F. Fuchs C.S. Chittenden T. Li Y. Farnham P.J. Blanar M.A. Livingston D.M. Flemington E.K. Cell. 1992; 70: 351-364Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar), followed by hybridization with the 32P-labeled GST-p45 or GST-p45(P81A,Y83G) for 4 h at 4 °C in the same blocking solution (∼50,000 cpm/ml). After hybridization, the membranes were washed four times with Hyb75 containing 1% non-fat dry milk, air-dried, and exposed to x-ray films. p45-(38–115) and p45-(38–115: P81A, Y83G) fragments were individually PCR-amplified with primers U/V, using the p45 and p45(P81A,Y83G) cDNAs, respectively, as the templates. PCR products were digested with EcoRI andPstI and cloned into the same sites in Gal4-DNA binding domain (GBD) vector pGBT9, resulting in the plasmids pGBD-p45-(38–115) and pGBD-p45-(38–115:P81A,Y83G). The NH2-terminal hRPF1 coding for amino acids 1–553 (N-hRPF1) was amplified by RT-PCR from KG-1 cell RNA using the primers W and X, digested withHindIII and BamHI, and cloned into yeast Gal4 activation domain (GAD) vector pACT2-I at NcoI andBamHI sites. Ligation between the HindIII site of N-hRPF1 and the NcoI site of pACT2-I was facilitated by an annealed oligo consisting of the primers Y and Z. This cloning resulted in the generation of plasmid pGAD-N-hRPF1. pGAD-hYAP-(1–345) was constructed by ligation of a NcoI-XhoI fragment from hYAP cDNA at the same sites in pACT2-I. The yeast two-hybrid assay was carried out as described (30Fields S. Song O.K. Nature. 1989; 340: 245-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (4860) Google Scholar, 31Chien C.T. Bartel P.L. Sternglanz R. Fields S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9578-9582Crossref PubMed Scopus (1226) Google Scholar). Different combinations of the above GBD- and GAD-based plasmids were co-transformed into yeast HF7c and tested for their ability to grow on -Leu-Trp-His plates. The interaction between p45 and different WW domains is analyzed by Far-Western blot analysis. As a positive control, we first studied the binding of the PY motif of WBP-1 to the WW domains by this approach (Fig. 2). The WBP-1 PY motif, of the sequence GTPPPPYTVG, is known to interact with the YAP WW domains (17Sudol M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 161-163Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 18Chen H.I. Sudol M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7819-7823Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar, 19Sudol M. Bork P. Einbond A. Kastury K. Druck T. Negrini M. Huebner K. Lehman D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14733-14741Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). As shown, the WBP-1 PY motif binds the three YAP-WW domains with approximately equal affinities. It also binds mNEDD4-WW2 and hDys-WW with lower and varying affinities (Fig. 2 B). Far-Western analysis then demonstrates that p45 indeed binds to a subset of the WW domains tested (Fig. 3). As shown in Fig. 3 B, binding between p45 and mNEDD4-WW2 is the strongest (lane 5, Fig. 3 B). p45 also binds efficiently to hYAP-WW and mYAP-WW1 (lanes 1 and2, Fig. 3 B), but less efficiently to mYAP-WW2 (lane 3, Fig. 3 B). However, p45 does not bind to the other WW domains tested (lanes 4, 6, and 7, Fig. 3 B) as well as GST-WBP1-PY or GST (lanes 8and 9, Fig. 3 B). To test whether PY motif at amino acids 79–83 of p45 is essential for the observed interaction between p45 and the WW domains, we then carried out Far-Western blot analysis using the GST-p45 and GST-p45(P81A,Y83G) mutant as the hybridization probes. As shown in Fig. 3 C, the two amino acid substitutions at positions Pro81 and Tyr83 of p45 abolish its interaction with all of the tested WW domains (Fig. 3 C). Far-Western blot hybridization with cold p45 gave the same results. 2N. R. Gavva, data not shown. Note that in the blot of Fig. 3 C, a NIPP1-(1–203) polypeptide fused to GST was included as a positive control. NIPP1 is a novel p45-binding protein, 3N. R. Gavva and C.-K. J. Shen, unpublished data. and its interaction with p45 is not modulated through the PY motif of p45 (comparelanes 10 of Fig. 3, B and C). The yeast two-hybrid system was used to test whether p45 could interact in vivo with two of the WW domain-containing proteins, hRPF1 and hYAP. hRPF1 is the human homolog of mNEDD4 (19Sudol M. Bork P.

Plasmids expressing GBD only, GBD fusion of p45-(38–115), and GBD fusion of p45-(38–115:P81A,Y83G), respectively, are individually co-transformed into yeast HF7C strain with plamids expressing GAD only, GAD fusion of hRPF1-(1–553), and GAD fusion of hYAP-(1–345). As indicated by the data of Fig. 4, both hRPF1 and hYAP interact with p45-(38–115) in yeast cells, but not with p45-(38–115:P81A,Y83G) containing the mutated PY motif. Recently it was shown that yeast RNA pol II is the substrate of the ubiquitin ligase Rsp5. This reaction is mediated through binding between the CTD domain of RNA pol II and the NH2-terminal part of Rsp5 (24Huibregtse J.M. Yang J.C. Beaudenon S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3656-3661Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). RNA pol II-CTD contains several py motifs with a consensus “XSPXY.” We have tested whether the CTD of mammalian RNA pol II could also bind mNEDD4, the mammalian homolog of Rsp5, through one of the three WW domains of the latter. Indeed, as shown in Fig.5, CTD of mouse RNA pol II binds efficiently to the YAP WW domains as well as to mNEDD4-WW2, but not to the WW1 and WW3 of mNEDD4, yEss1-WW, hDys-WW, or GST (Fig.5 B). This clearly indicates that mammalian RNA pol II-CTD could bind to the mammalian ubiquitin ligase. Furthermore, this binding, in mouse or humans, is most likely mediated through the WW2, but not with the other WW domains of the ubiquitin ligase(s) (also see “Discussion”). It is interesting to note that RNA pol II-CTD binds the same set of WW domains as p45, although the affinities toward different WW domains are different between the two probes (compare Figs. 3 B and 5 B). NF-E2 activates transcription of the globin genes through binding to the locus control regions of the globin loci (reviewed in Refs. 32Orkin S.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 231: 271-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholarand 33Grosveld F. Dillon N. Higgs D. Bailliere's Clin. Haematol. 1993; 6: 31-55Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Alternatively, it can activate transcription of genes such as porphobilinogen deaminase through binding to their upstream promoters (11Mignotte V. Eleouet J.F. Raich N. Romeo P.-H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 6548-6552Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 34Mignotte V. Wall L. de Boer E. Grosveld F. Romeo P.-H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 37-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Similar to the other sequence-specific, DNA-binding transcription factors (reviewed in Refs. 35Goodrich J.A. Cutler G. Tjian R. Cell. 1996; 84: 825-830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar and 36Roeder R.G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 327-335Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar), these activation processes by NF-E2 must involve the interaction of NF-E2 with other transcription activators or co-activators, as exemplified in Ref. 14Cheng X.B. Reginato M.J. Andrews N.C. Lazar M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1407-1416Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar. The present identification of the PY motif of p45 as a ligand for specific WW domains has revealed a new class of interacting proteins through which the trans-activation function of NF-E2 could be regulated. Far-Western blot analysis demonstrates that the p45 subunit of NF-E2, as well as the CTD of RNA pol II, binds specific sets of the WW domains (Figs. 3 and 5). The various WW domains of several WW domain-containing proteins and the relative strength of their interaction with p45 and RNA pol II-CTD are listed in TableI.Table IDifferent WW domains binding with p45/NF-E2 and RNA pol II-CTDProtein/speciesPositionSequence of WW domainsAccession no.Binding to p45 NF-E2Binding to RNA pol II-CTD11 30 38 481-aNumbers indicate the amino acid position in WW domain as shown for hYAP-WW in Ref. 20.mYAP-1151VPLPAGWEMAKTSS-GQRYFLNHNDQTTTWQDPRKAMLSX80508+++++++mYAP-2218GPLPDGWEQAMIQD-GEVYYINHKNKTTSWLDPRLDPRFX80508+++++hYAP171VPLPAGWEMAKTSS-GQRYFLNHIDQTTTWQDPRKAMLSX80507+++++++mNEDD4-1139SPLPPGWEERQDVL-GRTYYVNHESRRTQWKRPSPDDDLU96635−−mNEDD4-2295SGLPPGWEEKQDDR-GRSYYVDHNSKTTTWSKPTMQDDPU96635+++++++++mNEDD4-3350GPLPPGWEERTHTD GRVFFINHNIKKTQWEDPRLQNVAU96635ND1-bND, not determined.−yEss129TGLPTPWTARYSKSKKREYFFNPETKHSQWEEPEGINKDP22696−−hDys3052TSVQGPWERAISPN-KVPYYINHETQTTCWDHPKMTELYP11532−−hRPF1-1218SPLPPGWEERQDIL-GRTYYVNHESRRTQWKRPTPQDNLD42055hRPF1-2375SGLPPGWEEKQDER-GRSYYVDHNSRTTTWTKPTVQATVD42055+++1-cp45-(38–115) interacted with hRPF1-(1–553) in yeast two-hybrid system.NDhRPF1-3448GFLPKGWEVRHAPN-GRPFFIDHNTKTTTWEDPRLKIPAD42055hRPF1-4500GPLPPGWEERTHTD-GRIFYINHNIKRTQWEDPRLENVAD42055yRsp5-1228GRLPPGWERRTDNF-GRTYYVDHNTRTTTWKRPTLDQTEL11119yRsp5-2331GELPSGWEQRFTPE-GRAYFVDHNTRTTTWVDPRRQQYIL11119ND +++ 1-dThe NH2 terminus of RSP5 binding with RNA pol II-CTD contains all of the three WW domains listed (see Ref. 24).yRsp5-3387GPLPSGWEMRLTNT-ARVYFVDHNTKTTTWDDPRLPSSLL111191-a Numbers indicate the amino acid position in WW domain as shown for hYAP-WW in Ref. 20Macias M.J.

In particular, NMR analysis of the hYAP-WW domain-bound WBP1-PY motif indicated that Trp39 in the WW domain contacts the 2nd and 3rd prolines of PPPPY. In addition, Leu30 and His32 contact the tyrosine (20Macias M.J. Hyvonen M. Baraldi E. Schultz J. Sudol M. Saraste M. Oschkinat H. Nature. 1996; 382: 646-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). Binding site for the peptides is a large hydrophobic patch on the WW domain surface formed by side chains of Tyr28, Leu30, Trp39 and by the methyl groups of one or more threonines at positions 36–38. Consistent with the above, and the extensive data on site-directed mutagenesis of the PY motif of WBP1 (37Chen H. Einbond A. Kwak S.-J. Linn H. Korpf E. Peterson S. Kelly J.W. Sudol M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17070-17077Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), mutation at the 3rd proline and the tyrosine of the p45 PY motif abolished its binding with the WW domains (Fig. 3 C). A close examination of the sequences listed in Table I suggests that the presence of three clustered threonines at 36–38 is one of the major determinants for a strong interaction between a WW domain and p45. The binding affinity is drastically reduced when one of the threonine's is substituted with different amino acids. Furthermore, a change of Leu30 to Val30 in mNEDD4-WW2 appears to result in a relative higher affinity toward p45, in comparison with those of mYAP-WW1 and hYAP-WW (Table I). Following the above reasoning, we anticipate that it is the WW2 domain, but not WW1, WW3, or WW4 of hRPF1, that is responsible for the interaction in vivobetween p45-(38–115) and N-hRPF1 (Fig. 4). Although the exact functions of the motif-specific interaction between p45 and WW domains await further investigations, it is possible that the WW domain-containing proteins are involved in the regulation of the NF-E2 activity via one or more of the following mechanisms. First, p45 interacts efficiently with YAP (Figs. 3 and 4). Since YAP can associate with the SH3 domain of the Yes tyrosine kinase, it is possible that YAP-like protein(s) may target some of its WW domain-binding proteins, such as p45 and RNA pol II, for phosphorylation by kinases. Thus, activity of NF-E2 could be regulated by phosphorylation at specific residues. Second, hRPF1 has been shown to function as a co-activator/potentiator for hormone receptor-mediated transcriptional activation (26Imhof M.O. McDonnell D.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2594-2605Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Thus, hRPF1 or its family members may act, through direct binding to p45, as co-activators or even repressors for NF-E2 regulated transcription in erythroid and/or megakaryotic cells. Third, like its homologs, Rsp5 (23Hein C. Springael J.Y. Volland C. Haguenauer-Tsapis R. Andre B. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 18: 77-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar, 24Huibregtse J.M. Yang J.C. Beaudenon S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3656-3661Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar) and mNEDD4 (25Hatakeyama S. Jensen J.P. Weissman A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15085-15092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), hRPF1 may also possess ubiquitin ligase activity. As demonstrated (24Huibregtse J.M. Yang J.C. Beaudenon S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3656-3661Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar), Rsp5 and its homologs, when bound to RNA pol II-CTD, may ubiquitinate the RNA polymerase II. As shown in Figs. 3 and 5, p45 and RNA pol II are capable of binding to a similar subset of WW domains. Furthermore, p45 interacts with hRPF1 in vivo (Fig. 4). Thus, it is likely that mNEDD4 or hRPF1 negatively regulates NF-E2 activity by ubiquitinating p45 and targeting it to the proteasome degradation pathway. It is also possible that through utilization of different WW domains, Rsp5 homologs such as the mNEDD4/hRPF1 or others could serve as a binding bridge between NF-E2 and RNA polymerase II. Such a tertiary complex may play a role during transcriptional activation of erythroid-specific genes by NF-E2. Alternatively, DNA-bound p45 may recruit mNEDD4/hRPF1-like proteins to ubiquitinate nearby histones, a reaction that may lead to an open chromatin structure (39Li W. Nagaraja S. Deleuve G.P. Hendzel M.J. Davis J.R. Biochem. J. 1993; 296: 737-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 40Bradbury E.M. Bioessays. 1992; 14: 9-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). p45 and the bound WW domain proteins may also form tertiary complexes with other nuclear proteins such as the protein kinases of splicing factors, as identified recently (41Bedford M.T. Chan D.C. Leder P. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2376-2383Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Finally, it should be noted that there is an increasing number of WW domain-containing proteins found in cells carrying out diverse regulatory functions (Ref. 42Sudol M. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1996; 65: 113-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Indeed, three more such proteins belonging to the Rsp5/NEDD4 family have recently been cloned by a ligand screening procedure (38Pirozzi G. McConnell S.J. Uveges A.J. Carter J.M. Sparks A.B. Kay B.K.

N-terminal splice variants of the human KvLQT1 gene have been identified, but the functional roles of different KvLQT1 isoforms are not clear. Using the nested 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends technique, we obtained a truncated isoform of KvLQT1 (termed tKvLQT1) that lacks the N-terminal cytoplasmic domain and the initial one-third of the first transmembrane domain. The function of tKvLQT1 was tested by oocyte expression, alone or together with the full-length KvLQT1 or a human IsK clone (hIsK). tKvLQT1 alone did not generate functional channels. However, it suppressed the KvLQT1 current when coexpressed with the full-length isoform. It also suppressed the slow delayed rectifier current induced by hIsK, probably by competing with the KvLQT1 subunit endogenous toXenopus oocytes in coassembly with the hIsK subunit. On the other hand, tKvLQT1 did not suppress the expression of Kv1.4, Kv4.3, or hERG. Using the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction technique, we further show that the truncated and full-length isoforms are coexpressed in different regions of human heart. Therefore, tKvLQT1 may modulate the function of IKs in human cardiac myocytes.

The full-length KvLQT1 encodes a potassium channel whose properties do not resemble those of any potassium channel described for cardiac myocytes (2Sanguinetti M.C. Curran M.E. Zou A. Shen J.

However, when coexpressed with IsK (also called minK) in mammalian cells, a potassium channel with properties similar to those of cardiac slow delayed rectifier (IKs) channel is produced (2Sanguinetti M.C.

Romey G. Nature. 1996; 384: 78-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (1378) Google Scholar). These results suggest that KvLQT1 subunits probably do not form homomultimer channels in the heart, but are associated with IsK subunits to form functional IKs channels. Expressing IsK alone in oocytes can induce an IKs current, because oocytes have an endogenous KvLQT1 subunit (2Sanguinetti M.C. Curran M.E. Zou A. Shen J. Spector P.S. Atkinson D.L. Keating M.T. Nature. 1996; 384: 80-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (1501) Google Scholar). Coexpression of exogenous KvLQT1 with IsK in oocytes greatly increases the amplitude of IKs, probably by augmenting the KvLQT1 protein level in the oocytes (2Sanguinetti M.C. Curran M.E. Zou A.

In eubacteria, the two genes are separated by a short, untranslated linker; in archaea they overlap by several codons (7Bult C.J. White O. Olsen G.J. Zhou L. Fleischmann R.D. Sutton G.G. Blake J.A.

In this work we demonstrate that the E. coli rpoB andrpoC genes, coding, respectively, for the 1342 amino acid-long β and the 1407-amino acid-long β′ subunits, can be fused and that the resulting β::β′ fusion protein assembles into functional RNAPin vivo and in vitro. Furthermore, when a hexahistidine tag (His6 tag) is inserted at the fusion site between β and β′, the resulting RNAP can be immobilized on a sorbent containing Ni2+ ions and is transcriptionally active in the immobilized state. On the basis of these data we conclude that the C terminus of β and the N terminus of β′ are within a very short distance of each other on the surface of the RNAP molecule during all phases of transcription.

https://openalex.org/W2081552825,"The transport of pro-cathepsin D from thetrans-Golgi network (TGN) to the endosomal pathway is dependent on binding to the calcium-independent mannose 6-phosphate receptor (ci-M6PR), which is incorporated into TGN-derived clathrin-coated transport vesicles (CCVs). Inhibition of this transport step by wortmannin has led to the proposal that it is dependent upon a phosphoinositide 3-kinase activity necessary for ci-M6PR recruitment into TGN-derived CCVs or in the formation of those vesicles (Brown, W. J., DeWald, D. B., Emr, S. D., Plutner, H., and Balch, W. E. (1995) J. Cell Biol. 130, 781–796; Davidson, H. W. (1995) J. Cell Biol. 130, 797–806). In this study we have addressed the effect of wortmannin on the TGN step of the ci-M6PR cycle. CCVs from K562 cells, pretreated or not with 250 nm wortmannin, were purified on equilibrium density gradients. Quantification of TGN-derived CCVs, assessed by γ-adaptin content in purified vesicle fractions, showed that the formation of the vesicles was only marginally decreased after 20 min of treatment with the drug, while for the same wortmannin treatment, the amount of ci-M6PR recruited into those vesicles was decreased by 70% compared with control. At a later time point (2 h), a reduction in the amount of γ-adaptin in CCV fractions was also observed. These findings demonstrate that inhibition of ci-M6PR recruitment into CCVs but not of vesicle formation is the primary reason for the observed defect in cathepsin D transport following wortmannin treatment.

For many years, intracellular membrane traffic has been considered to comprise protein-regulated events governing vesicle formation and fusion, while a passive role has been generally assumed for phospholipids. During the same period, phosphoinositides have been widely studied for their participation in transducing inputs received by cell surface receptors. For example, activation of G-protein-coupled receptors may result in stimulation of phospholipase C hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2), 1The abbreviations used are: PIP2, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate; ci-M6PR, calcium-independent mannose 6-phosphate receptor; CCV, clathrin-coated vesicle; FBS, fetal bovine serum; HRP, horseradish peroxidase; MEM, minimal essential medium; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; M6P, mannose 6-phosphate; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PDGF, platelet-derived growth factor; Pen/Strep, penicillin (100 units/ml)/streptomycin (100 μg/ml); PI3K, phosphoinositide 3-kinase; PLC, prelysosomal compartment; PtdIns, phosphatidylinositol, TGN, trans-Golgi network. leading to the production of the second messengers inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and diacylglycerol. Phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI3Ks) have also been extensively studied for their role in cellular proliferation and differentiation resulting from their interaction with growth factor receptors (1Kapeller R. Cantley L.C. BioEssays. 1994; 16: 565-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar). More recently, different types of PI3K have been isolated and cloned, which may play other roles in the cell, including the regulation of membrane traffic (2Zvelebil M.J. MacDougall L. Leevers S.

Together with separate observations linking the small GTPase ADP-ribosylation factor, which is involved in budding of coated vesicles, to activation of phospholipase D, these studies have promoted widespread interest in the role of lipids in governing aspects of membrane traffic (3Ktistakis N.T.

The use of wortmannin, a specific inhibitor of PI3K in the low nanomolar range (4Wymann M.P. Bulgarelli-Leva G. Zvelebil M.J. Pirola L. Vanhaesebroeck B. Waterfield M.D. Panayatou G. Mol.

Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 797-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Two major PI3K classes have now been characterized. The first class includes the wortmannin-sensitive heterodimeric mammalian PI3Ks represented by the p85/p110 kinases, which link to receptors with tyrosine kinase activity (1Kapeller R. Cantley L.C. BioEssays. 1994; 16: 565-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar), and the p101/p117 or p101/p120 PI3Ks, which are activated by heterotrimeric G-protein βγ-subunits (16Stephens L. Smrcka A. Cooke F.T. Jackson T.R. Sternweis P.C. Hawkins P.T. Cell. 1994; 77: 83-93Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar). These heterodimeric PI3Ks exhibit an in vivo substrate preference for PIP2 (17Stephens L. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1995; 23: 207-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The second class, specific for phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns), is exemplified by the wortmannin-resistant Vps34p from Saccharomyces cerevisiae(18Stack J.H. Emr S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31552-31562Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and a recently identified wortmannin-sensitive mammalian PtdIns 3-kinase (19Volinia S. Dhand R. Vanhaesebroeck B.

Among membrane traffic pathways involving the phosphoinositide machinery, the transport of vacuolar enzymes from the TGN to the yeast vacuole was the first in which a PI3K activity was implicated. This result was based on the observation of abnormal secretion of carboxypeptidase Y in a S. cerevisiae strain mutated for a gene encoding Vps34p, subsequently identified as the yeast PtdIns 3-kinase (18Stack J.H. Emr S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31552-31562Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Stack J.H. Horazdovsky B. Emr S.D. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1995; 11: 1-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 21Schu P.V. Takegawa K. Fry M.J. Stack J.H. Waterfield M.D. Emr S.D. Science. 1993; 260: 88-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar). In the wild type strain, the enzyme is routed to the vacuolar compartment. On the basis of wortmannin sensitivity, a role for a PI3K was reported in mammalian cells for the calcium-independent mannose 6-phosphate receptor (ci-M6PR)-mediated transport of lysosomal protease cathepsin D (14Brown W.J. DeWald D.B. Emr S.D. Plutner H. Balch W.E. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 781-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 15Davidson H.W. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 797-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). This pathway is analogous to the TGN-vacuole pathway in yeast. In these studies the pro-cathepsin D was observed to be secreted into the extracellular medium following wortmannin treatment, instead of being delivered to the early endosomal compartment and then processed during its transport toward the lysosome. The authors proposed that wortmannin was inhibiting a PI3K activity necessary for a transport step in the ci-M6PR cycle, most likely involved at the exit from the TGN (14Brown W.J. DeWald D.B. Emr S.D. Plutner H. Balch W.E. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 781-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). However, no direct evidence was obtained to determine if the PI3K activity was required in the sorting of ci-M6PR into TGN-derived clathrin-coated vesicles (CCVs) or, alternatively, if the formation of the vesicles was itself dependent on PI3K activity. The answer to this question may have a wider significance as receptor sorting events in other subcellular compartments have also been shown to be wortmannin-sensitive. These include transferrin receptor recycling (10Spiro D.J. Boll W. Kirchhausen T. Wessling-Resnick M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 355-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar,11Shepherd P.R. Reaves B.J. Davidson H.W. Trends Cell Biol. 1996; 6: 92-97Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), trafficking of the GLUT4 transporter (22Yang J. Clarke J.F. Ester C.J. Young P.W. Kasuga M. Holman G.D. Biochem. J. 1996; 313: 125-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), and the traffic of PDGF receptor through endosomal compartments (12Joly M. Kazlauskas A. Fay F.S. Corvera S. Science. 1994; 263: 684-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 13Joly M. Kazlauskas A. Corvera S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13225-13230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). In the present study we have developed a method to investigate the role of the PI3K activity in the ci-M6PR-mediated transport of lysosomal enzymes from the TGN to the early endosome in K562 cells. The method is based on an established protocol of CCV purification, which takes advantage of their characteristic density due to the presence of their protein coat (23Woodman P.G. Warren G. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 219: 251-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). Moreover, the coat of TGN-derived CCVs contains a specific adaptor protein, γ-adaptin, allowing us to distinguish them from co-isolated plasma membrane-derived CCVs, which contain α-adaptin rather than γ-adaptin. Purification of CCVs from K562 cells, pretreated or not with wortmannin, and quantification of the relative amounts of γ-adaptin and ci-M6PR in the vesicle fractions indicated that wortmannin was not primarily affecting CCV formation at the TGN, but that the vesicles produced were depleted of ci-M6PR. We conclude that a wortmannin-sensitive PI3K is implicated in ci-M6PR sorting into TGN-derived CCVs but not in the vesicle formation step itself.

Mouse anti-(bovine brain α-adaptin) antibody (clone 100/2), mouse anti-(bovine brain γ-adaptin) antibody (clone 100/3), and goat HRP-coupled secondary antibodies were from Sigma. All other reagents were obtained from Sigma. K562 cells were grown from 2 × 105 to 106 cells/ml at 37 °C in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (FBS), penicillin (100 units/ml)/streptomycin (100 μg/ml) (Pen/Strep) in a 95% air, 5% CO2 humidified incubator. CCVs were isolated from K562 cells by a modification of the method of Woodman and Warren (24Woodman P.G. Warren G. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 112: 1133-1141Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). 1.6 × 108 cells were washed twice (700 ×g for 6 min) with 37 °C phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and incubated for 3 h in 20 ml of MEM supplemented with Pen/Strep, 2% (v/v) 1 m Hepes, pH 7.3, 5% (v/v) FBS, and 0.5 mCi of Tran35S-Label. Approximately 1.3 × 109nonlabeled cells were then combined with 35S-labeled cells, washed with 37 °C PBS, and resuspended at 2.5 × 106 cells/ml in 37 °C RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with Pen/Strep, 1% (v/v) FBS, and 2% (v/v) 1 m Hepes, pH 7.3. Cells were finally split into three flasks and incubated at 37 °C with or without 250 nm wortmannin for 20 and 120 min. The following steps were performed at 4 °C. Cells were washed twice with vesicle buffer (10 mm MES, 75 mm KOAc, 2 mm EGTA, 1 mm MgCl2, 140 mm sucrose, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 μg/ml leupeptin A, pH 6.6, supplemented with 250 nm wortmannin when used for wortmannin-treated cells) and resuspended into 5 ml of vesicle buffer. Cells were broken open using a stainless steel homogenizer (EMBL cell cracker) by passing 15 times through a 8.02-mm bore containing a 8.002-mm diameter ball. Post-nuclear supernatants were prepared by a 10-min centrifugation at 1,000 × g, treated for 30 min with 50 μg/ml ribonuclease A, and centrifuged for 40 min at 7,000 × g to prepare post-mitochondrial supernatants. For each condition, post-mitochondrial supernatant was applied to the top of two 10-ml continuous deuterium oxide gradients of 9–90% (w/v)2H2O in vesicle buffer and centrifuged for 35 min at 45,000 × g. Ten 1-ml fractions were collected from the top of each gradient. Fractions 2–7 were combined, diluted up to 24 ml with vesicle buffer, and centrifuged for 40 min at 100,000 × g. The pellets were resuspended in vesicle buffer, pooled for each condition, applied to the top of one 10-ml continuous gradient of 2% (w/v) Ficoll 400/9% (w/v)2H2O + 20% (w/v) Ficoll 400/90% (w/v)2H2O in vesicle buffer, and centrifuged for 12 h at 76,000 × g. Ten 1-ml fractions were collected from each gradient, precipitated with trichloroacetic acid, resuspended in reducing SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and incubated for 10 min at 90 °C. Finally, fractions were run on 10% SDS-PAGE gels, which were either Coomassie-stained and dried before quantification of35S label using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics) or transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. Immunoblots of γ-adaptin and ci-M6PR proteins were quantified by phosphorimaging (Molecular Dynamics) after 125I-protein A affinity binding (67 nCi/ml). Alternatively immunoblots of α-adaptin, γ-adaptin, and ci-M6PR were detected using a SuperSignal CL-HRP substrate system (Pierce & Warriner, Chester, UK) following incubation with HRP-coupled secondary antibody and quantified with IPLab Gel (Signal Analytics) from the Hyperfilm-ECL scan (ScanMaker plug-in for Adobe Photoshop, Microtek Lab). Post-mitochondrial supernatants were prepared as above and loaded on a continuous rate sedimentation gradient of 9–90%2H2O in vesicle buffer. After 35 min of centrifugation at 45,000 × g, 10 1-ml fractions were collected from the top of the gradient, diluted 1.5-fold with vesicle buffer, and centrifuged for 45 min at 100,000 × g. Pellets were resuspended in 100 μl of reducing SDS-PAGE sample buffer and run on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel, and proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. Immunoblots for γ-adaptin protein were detected using a SuperSignal CL-HRP substrate system following incubation with HRP-coupled secondary antibody and quantified as above. Cathepsin D chase experiments were performed as described previously (15Davidson H.W. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 797-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Briefly, 17.5 × 106 cells were washed with 37 °C bovine serum albumin, PBS (0.5% w/v), and resuspended in 11 ml 37 °C MEM supplemented with 5% (v/v) FBS, Pen/Strep. After 60 min at 37 °C, cells were washed with 37 °C PBS and resuspended in 0.35 ml of 37 °C MEM supplemented with 2% (v/v) 1 m Hepes, pH 7.3, and 280 μCi of Tran35S-Label. After 10 min of labeling at 37 °C, cells were washed twice with ice-cold bovine serum albumin, 0.5% (w/v) PBS, resuspended in 10 ml of ice-cold RPMI 1640 supplemented with 2% (v/v) 1 m Hepes, pH 7.3, 3 mm methionine, 5 mm mannose 6-phosphate (M6P), and split into three aliquots to be kept on ice or incubated at 37 °C for 120 min with or without 250 nm wortmannin. Finally cell suspensions were centrifuged for 5 min at 250 ×g. The cells (pellets) were resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 1% (w/v) Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.4), and cells and media (supernatants) were supplemented with protease inhibitors (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 50 μmleupeptin, 1 μm pepstatin A, 50 μmaprotinin). After 10 min on ice, cells and half of the media were centrifuged for 10 min at 25,000 × g and 5 μl of rabbit anti-(human cathepsin D) antibody was added to supernatants for an overnight incubation at 4 °C. Immune complexes were collected using 20 μl of protein A-agarose, washed three times with wash buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 1% (w/v) Triton X-100, 5 mm EDTA, 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate, 1% (w/v) sodium deoxycholate, pH 7.5), washed once with 10 mmTris-HCl, pH 6.8, and resuspended in 50 μl of 1.1-fold concentrated SDS-PAGE nonreducing sample buffer. After 10 min at 90 °C, samples were loaded on a 12% SDS-PAGE gel, which was then dried, autoradiographed, and quantified using a PhosphorImager. Pro-cathepsin D is synthesized in human cells as a 53-kDa pro-enzyme, which is modified by the addition of M6P residues that provide the recognition signal for ci-M6PR-mediated sorting at the TGN into CCVs (25Hasilik A. Neufeld E.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 4937-4945Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Pro-cathepsin D is then delivered to endosomal compartments, where it is cleaved to form the 47-kDa intermediate form and then the 31-kDa mature form (26Delbrück R.C. Desel C. von Figura K. Hille-Rehfeld A. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 64: 7-14PubMed Google Scholar). As shown previously for rat clone 9 hepatocytes, NRK, CHO, MDBK (14Brown W.J. DeWald D.B. Emr S.D. Plutner H. Balch W.E. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 781-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar), and K562 cells (15Davidson H.W. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 797-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), wortmannin treatment triggers a mistargeting of pro-cathepsin D. Following a 10-min pulse radiolabeling with Tran35S-Label, pro-cathepsin D remained associated with cells kept at 4 °C for 120 min and was not processed (Fig.1, no chase). When cells were incubated for 120 min at 37 °C in the presence of extracellular M6P and in the absence of wortmannin most of the pro-cathepsin D was normally matured and remained associated with the cell, while only a small amount was secreted in the medium (Fig. 1, ctrl). Incubation with 250 nm wortmannin promoted pro-enzyme secretion into the medium, while very few mature or intermediate forms of cathepsin D were found associated with the cell or in the medium (Fig. 1, wrt). A minor intracellular band corresponding to the expected molecular weight of the intermediate form is apparent in control and wortmannin-treated cells at similar levels. The significance of this band is unclear, but it is important to note that no processed form is secreted into the medium, indicating that the route taken by the majority of the cathepsin D molecules does not dispose them to processing. Several studies have shown that endocytic trafficking and processing of externally applied cathepsin D is not inhibited by wortmannin (14Brown W.J. DeWald D.B. Emr S.D. Plutner H. Balch W.E. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 781-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 15Davidson H.W. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 797-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 27Nakajima Y. Pfeffer S.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 577-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), so it is highly unlikely that cathepsin D is secreted via an endosomal compartment. The presence of proteins coating the vesicle lipid bilayers confers upon vesicles a high density, which can be exploited for the preparation of highly enriched fractions of CCVs on Ficoll/2H2O equilibrium density gradients. Post-mitochondrial supernatants containing ∼35% of total radioactivity incorporated in cells (data not shown) were first applied to 10-ml 9–90% 2H2O velocity gradients (see “Experimental Procedures”). Immunoblot analysis of gradient fractions for γ-adaptin (Fig.2 a) showed that membrane associated γ-adaptin was concentrated in fractions 2–7 (1 ml, fraction 1 = top). This is in agreement with the ATP-dependent immunoprecipitation profile of125I-transferrin observed previously by Woodman and Warren (24Woodman P.G. Warren G. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 112: 1133-1141Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) in the same gradient. Moreover, quantification of γ-adaptin immunoblots showed no significant difference in γ-adaptin distribution regardless of wortmannin treatment (Fig. 2 b). Fractions 2–6, representing ∼6% of total radioactivity in cells (data not shown) were pooled for further purification. Fig.3 a demonstrates typical radioactivity profiles after fractions 2–6 were applied on 10-ml Ficoll/2H2O equilibrium density gradients. Similar radioactivity profiles were obtained through the gradient regardless of wortmannin treatment. Two peaks were observed accounting for contaminating membranes (lightest peak, fractions 1–4) and for CCVs (heaviest peak, fractions 6–8) as demonstrated previously on the basis of their fusion activity (23Woodman P.G. Warren G. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 219: 251-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). CCV peak in control cells represented ∼1% of total radioactivity associated with cells as estimated previously by Pearse (28Pearse B.M.F. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 98: 320-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Fig. 3 b shows a typical autoradiography of fractions collected from the Ficoll/2H2O gradient and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Fractions 6–8 contained a major band at 180 kDa and other bands at ∼100 kDa and 45–50 kDa consistent with the presence of clathrin heavy chain and the adaptor complexes, respectively (28Pearse B.M.F. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 98: 320-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar).Figure 3Purification of CCVs on Ficoll/2H2O equilibrium density gradient. a, Tran35S-Label incorporated in proteins during biosynthetic labeling of cells was counted in 1-ml fractions (1 = top) collected from Ficoll/2H2O gradients (see “Experimental Procedures”) for control cells (○) and cells treated for 20 min (□) or 120 min (•) with 250 nmwortmannin. b, 1-ml Ficoll/2H2O gradient fractions (1 = top) were analyzed on 10% SDS-PAGE and autoradiographed. Molecular size marker positions on Coomassie-stained SDS-PAGE are indicated on the right (MW). As no significant difference can be observed between autoradiography of SDS-PAGE of control and wortmannin-treated cells, only autoradiography for control cells is shown here.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To determine if wortmannin treatment was inhibiting CCV formation at the TGN or ci-M6PR recruitment in those vesicles, we analyzed γ-adaptin and ci-M6PR contents in fractions collected from the Ficoll/2H2O gradients. The level of γ-adaptin is the critical indicator of TGN-derived clathrin-coated vesicles and the ratio of γ-adaptin over total Tran35S-Label radioactivity (γ-adaptin/total35S) in the gradient is the appropriately normalized ratio for judging their relative abundance. The ratio of ci-M6PR/γ-adaptin is the critical indicator of receptor content in TGN-derived CCVs. Clathrin heavy chain, accounting for both plasma membrane- and TGN-derived CCVs and α-adaptin (only plasma membrane-derived CCVs), has also been analyzed in those fractions to provide accessory information regarding the effect of wortmannin on CCV formation in K562 cells (Fig. 5). Fig. 4 shows results obtained from the analysis of a typical experiment. γ-Adaptin (Fig.4 a) and ci-M6PR (Fig. 4 b) in fractions 5 to 8 were detected from immunoblots using 125I-protein A affinity binding and subsequent phosphorimaging. α-Adaptin (Fig.4 c) was detected from immunoblots using a SuperSignal CL-HRP substrate system. Clathrin heavy chain content was directly determined by PhosphorImager analysis of the 35S signal (Fig.4 d). Intensity measurements of immunoblots (Fig. 4,a–c) or 35S label (Fig. 4 d) were normalized by ratioing over total Tran35S-Label radioactivity measured in fractions 1–10 of the Ficoll/2H2O gradients (Fig. 3 a). Normalized results obtained from data of Fig. 4 are presented in Fig.5, where control condition ratios have been set to 100%.Figure 4Analysis of CCV fractions. Fractions (1 ml) from equilibrium density gradients were analyzed for γ-adaptin, ci-M6PR, α-adaptin, and clathrin heavy chain contents. All fractions were analyzed, but only those containing signals for CCVs (γ-adaptin, α-adaptin, ci-M6PR) are shown. Position of fractions 5–8 (F5–F8) are indicated at the bottom of the figure for the four panels. Cells treatments were as follows: no wortmannin (ctrl), 20 min (20 min), or 120 min (120 min) with 250 nm wortmannin. Immunoblots of γ-adaptin (a), ci-M6PR (b) detected using125I-protein A, and α-adaptin (c) using a SuperSignal CL-HRP substrate system. d, windows of the SDS-PAGE autoradiography corresponding to the 180-kDa clathrin heavy chain band.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The γ-adaptin/total 35S ratio, which gives a measure for the amount of CCVs formed at the TGN due to the specific localization of γ-adaptin in that compartment, was slightly decreased to 81% of control after 20 min of treatment with wortmannin but significantly decreased to 46% after 2 h of incubation with the drug (Fig. 5). Quantification of ci-M6PR immunoblots revealed a much larger decrease in ci-M6PR/total 35S ratio than in γ-adaptin/total35S; normalized ratios were 28% and 7% compared with control cells after 20 and 120 min of treatment, respectively. Moreover, ci-M6PR/γ-adaptin ratios were calculated as an indicator for the level of ci-M6PR in TGN-derived CCVs. Taking this ratio as 100% in control cells, ci-M6PR/γ-adaptin decreased to 34% and 15% after 20 min and 2 h of incubation with wortmannin, respectively, indicating a significant decrease in ci-M6PR incorporation into TGN-derived CCVs. Densitometry measurement of immunoblots for α-adaptin in CCV fractions showed that α-adaptin/total 35S ratio was increased to 140% of control following 20 min of treatment with wortmannin, in accord with previous observations showing a 1.4-fold increase in transferrin receptor internalization into K562 cells following wortmannin treatment (10Spiro D.J.

Because protease nexin-1 expression has been shown to be regulated during skeletal muscle cell differentiation, we reasoned that thrombin inactivation may be an important requirement for this developmental process. To test this hypothesis, we examined the effects of thrombin on differentiating C2C12 myoblasts. We report here that myogenesis, as scored by myotube formation, is considerably delayed by thrombin. This regulation correlated with delayed expression of myogenin and p21CIP1/WAF1, both considered critical components of the skeletal muscle cell differentiation program. Regulation occurred at the RNA level, indicating that the effect of thrombin is either transcriptional or post-transcriptional. Furthermore, we present evidence suggesting that this regulation is mediated by the thrombin receptor. Although thrombin is mitogenic for certain cell types, we found that delay of myogenesis in C2C12 cells did not involve a mitogenic signal. Taken together, these results imply that inhibition of the serine protease thrombin may be required for proper progression through the myogenic differentiation program.

Once bound to the target cells, immunotoxins internalize into endocytic vesicles where the catalytic portion of the toxin is processed and released into the cytosol.

Mitsui K. Motizuki M. Tsurugi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 5908-5912Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and ADP-ribosylation of elongation factor 2 (11Honjo T. Nishizuka Y. Hayaishi O. Koto I. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 3553-3555Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Iglewski B.H. Liu P.V. Kabat K. Infect. Immun. 1977; 15: 138-144Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), respectively. However, even in the absence of a targeting domain, the native or non-targeted forms of these molecules are toxic in animals. The identification of novel toxins that are less systemically toxic but maintain potent cytotoxic activity when targeted to malignancies is likely to increase the therapeutic utility of immunotoxins. Bryodin 1 (BD1) is a type I RIP that was originally isolated from the roots of Bryonia dioica (13Stirpe F. Barbieri L. Battelli M.G. Falasca A.I. Abbondanza A. Lorenzoni E. Stevers W.A. Biochem. J. 1986; 240: 659-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Type I RIPs, which include BD1, gelonin, saporin, and trichosanthin, contain an enzymatic domain but no binding domain, while type II RIPs such as ricin contain two domains: a catalytic A chain and cell-binding B chain. BD1 was recently cloned from B. dioica leaf mRNA and expressed as a recombinant protein in Escherichia coli (14Gawlak S.L. Neubauer M. Klei H.E. Chang C.Y. Einspahr H.M. Siegall C.B. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 3095-3103Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of recombinant BD1 (rBD1) was resolved to 2.1 Å and indicated structural homology with other type I RIPs as well as the A chain of type II RIPs. BD1 was found to possess potent protein synthesis inhibitory activity in a cell-free system and was 20–30-fold less toxic in rodents than were other plant or bacterial toxins used in immunotoxin construction (14Gawlak S.L.

In this report, we describe the construction and in vitrocharacterization of a single-chain BD1-containing immunotoxin targeted to the human CD40 receptor. This immunotoxin, BD1-G28-5 sFv, was expressed in E. coli as a single polypeptide and consists of BD1 fused to the single-chain Fv (sFv) region of the anti-CD40 monoclonal antibody G28-5. CD40 is highly expressed on a variety of hematologic malignancies (16Uckun F.M. Gajl-Peczalska K. Myers D.E. Jaszcz W. Haissig S. Ledbetter J.A. Blood. 1990; 76: 2449-2456Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17O'Grady J.T. Stewart S. Lowrey J. Howie S.E.M. Krajewski A.S. Am. J. Pathol. 1994; 144: 21-26PubMed Google Scholar, 18Pellat-Deceunynck C. Bataille R. Robillard N. Haroussequ J.-L. Rapp M.-J. Juge-Morineau N. Wijdenes J. Amiot M. Blood. 1994; 84: 2597-2603Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), as well as on certain carcinomas (19Paulie S. Ehlin-Henriksson B. Mellstedt H. Koho H. Ben-Aissa H. Perlmann P. Cancer Immunol. Immunother. 1985; 20: 23-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 20Stamenkovic I. Clark E.A. Seed B. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 1403-1410Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). We have shown previously that a Pseudomonasexotoxin-based single-chain immunotoxin, G28-5 sFv-PE40, was potently and selectively cytotoxic in vitro against CD40-expressing malignant cell lines (21Francisco J.A. Gilliland L.K. Stebbins M.R. Norris N.A. Ledbetter J.A. Siegall C.B. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 3099-3104PubMed Google Scholar) and was efficacious in treating human non-Hodgkin's lymphoma xenografted SCID mice (22Francisco J.A. Schreiber G.J. Comereski C.R. Mezza L.E. Warner G.L. Davidson T.J. Ledbetter J.A. Siegall C.B. Blood. 1997; 89: 4493-4500Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because BD1 is less toxic than PE40 in mice and rats, it is anticipated that immunotoxins containing BD1 will have larger therapeutic windows. The data presented here indicate that BD1-G28-5 sFv is a potent antitumor agent against CD40-expressing hematologic malignancies. To construct the BD1-G28-5 sFv expression plasmid, pSE151, the gene encoding BD1 was first PCR-amplified from the BD1 expression plasmid pSE13.0 (14Gawlak S.L. Neubauer M. Klei H.E. Chang C.Y. Einspahr H.M. Siegall C.B. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 3095-3103Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The PCR primers were designed to include a 5′NdeI restriction site and a 3′ NcoI site. Subsequently, the gene encoding G28-5 sFv was PCR-amplified from pSE51, a previously described plasmid that encodes G28-5 sFv-PE40 (21Francisco J.A. Gilliland L.K. Stebbins M.R. Norris N.A. Ledbetter J.A. Siegall C.B. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 3099-3104PubMed Google Scholar), to include a 5′ NcoI site and a 3′ stop codon followed by anEcoRI site. The PCR products were digested with the appropriate restriction enzymes and ligated into pBW7.0, which had been digested with NdeI and EcoRI to remove BR96 sFv-PE40 (23Friedman P.N. McAndrew S.J. Gawlak S.L. Chace D. Trail P.A. Brown J.P. Siegall C.B. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 334-339PubMed Google Scholar). After transformation into E. coli strain DH5α, positive clones were identified by restriction enzyme analysis and verified by DNA sequencing. The resulting plasmid encoding BD1-G28-5 sFv contains the T7 promoter (24Studier F.W. Moffat B.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 189: 113-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (4842) Google Scholar). A 21-base pair cloning linker encoding the amino acid sequence RMHGTKA separates the BD1 and G28-5 sFv moieties. For expression of BD1-G28-5 sFv, E. coli strain BL21(λDE3) was transformed with pSE151 and was grown at 37 °C in LB medium containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin. When the cells had reached OD650 = 1.0, they were induced for 16 h with 1.0 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. The cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed in sucrose buffer (20% sucrose, 30 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 1 mm EDTA), and osmotically shocked with ice-cold H2O. The spheroplasts were pelleted by centrifugation and incubated for 1 h in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mm EDTA containing 0.25 mg/ml lysozyme. The inclusion bodies were isolated using a detergent extraction procedure as described previously (21Francisco J.A. Gilliland L.K. Stebbins M.R. Norris N.A. Ledbetter J.A. Siegall C.B. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 3099-3104PubMed Google Scholar), denatured in 7m guanidine HCl, and refolded in 20 mmNaH2PO4 (pH 7.4) containing 0.3 ml-arginine. After refolding for 48 h, the protein was dialyzed extensively against 20 mmNaH2PO4 and purified by Blue Sepharose (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.), followed by Poros HS (Perseptive, Cambridge, MA) chromatographies. The purified protein was analyzed by SDS-PAGE under non-reducing conditions and size exclusion chromatography using a TSK 3000SW column (TosoHaas, Philadelphia, PA). Cell-free inhibition of protein synthesis was determined using an in vitro rabbit reticulocyte system essentially as described previously (14Gawlak S.L. Neubauer M. Klei H.E. Chang C.Y. Einspahr H.M. Siegall C.B. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 3095-3103Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Briefly, various concentrations of BD1 or BD1-G28-5 sFv were mixed with rabbit reticulocyte lysate, a mixture of all 20 amino acids minus leucine, [3H]leucine, and brome mosaic virus RNA as the mRNA template in a final volume of 25 μl. After incubation for 1 h at 30 °C, the reaction was terminated by the addition of 1 m NaOH and 2% H2O2. The translated product was precipitated with 25% trichloroacetic acid containing 2% casamino acids, and the radiolabeled protein was harvested onto glass filters and counted in a liquid scintillation counter. For ELISA analysis, 96-well microtiter plates were coated with 0.5 μg/ml CD40-Ig (25Noelle R.J. Roy M. Shepherd D.M. Stamenkovic I. Ledbetter J.A. Aruffo A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6550-6554Crossref PubMed Scopus (795) Google Scholar) diluted in 50 mm carbonate/bicarbonate buffer (pH 9.6) and incubated overnight at 4 °C. Control plates were coated with chimeric BR96 antibody (26Trail P.A. Willner D. Lasch S.J. Henderson A.J. Hofstead S. Casazza A.M. Firestone R.A. Hellström I. Hellström K.E. Science. 1993; 261: 212-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar), which contains the same immunoglobulin domain as CD40-Ig. The plates were shaken dry, blocked with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 1% bovine serum albumin, and incubated with various concentrations of BD1-G28-5 sFv diluted in PBS/1% bovine serum albumin. For blocking studies wells were incubated with 25 μg/ml G28-5 or an isotype-matched control antibody. After washing three times with PBS, the plates were incubated with BD1-specific rabbit antiserum, washed three times, and then incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit Ig diluted 1:3,000. After five final washes, the plates were incubated with TMB Chromagen reagent (Genetic Systems, Redmond, WA) and the reaction was halted by the addition of 1 m H2SO4. The absorbance of each plate was measured at 450 nm. BIAcore binding analysis was performed on BIAcore 1000 and 2000 instruments (Pharmacia Biosensor, Uppsala, Sweden) at 25 °C using PBS containing 0.005% P20 surfactant (Pharmacia Biosensor) as the running buffer. The matrix was coated with CD40-Ig, samples of BD1-G28-5 sFv were injected, and the association and dissociation rates were determined by curve fitting using BIAevaluation 2.1 (Pharmacia Biosensor). The equilibrium constant, k d, was calculated by dividing the dissociation rate by the association rate. Burkitt's lymphoma cell lines Raji and Daudi, multiple myeloma lines HS-Sultan and IM-9, breast carcinoma line MCF-7, and monocytic cell line THP-1 were purchased from American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD). The multiple myeloma lines RAM and RLO were kindly provided by Dr. Joshua Epstein (University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, Little Rock, AR). T51 lymphoblastoid cells were a gift from Dr. Paul Gladstone (Bristol-Myers Squibb, Seattle, WA). The lung carcinoma line L2987, colon carcinoma H3619, and ovarian carcinoma line H4021 were established at Bristol-Myers Squibb Pharmaceutical Research Institute, Seattle, WA. All cell lines except MCF-7, H3619, L2987, and H4021 were maintained in RPMI 1640 media containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin G, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. MCF-7, H3619, L2987, and H4021 cells were grown in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium containing the same supplements as above. Cytotoxicity analysis was performed essentially as described previously (22Francisco J.A. Schreiber G.J. Comereski C.R. Mezza L.E. Warner G.L. Davidson T.J. Ledbetter J.A. Siegall C.B. Blood. 1997; 89: 4493-4500Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For the adherent lines (MCF-7, H3619, L2987, and H4021), cells were plated into 96-well flat bottom tissue culture plates at 104 cells/well. The cells were allowed to adhere overnight at 37 °C, and the next day the medium was removed and replaced with 100 μl of leucine-free RPMI medium. Samples of BD1-G28-5 sFv, G28-5 sFv-PE40, or BR96-BD1 (15Siegall C.B. Gawlak S.L. Chace D. Wolff E.A. Mixan B. Marquardt H. Bioconjugate Chem. 1994; 5: 423-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) diluted in leucine-free medium were then added to the cells. The plates were incubated for 24 h and then pulsed with 1 μCi/well [3H]leucine for 6 h. After freezing at −20 °C, the plates were harvested onto filters and the incorporation of [3H]leucine into cellular protein was analyzed with an LKB Beta-Plate liquid scintillation counter (Wallac, Gaithersburg, MD). The remaining cell lines were nonadherent; therefore, it was not necessary to allow them time to adhere to the 96-well tissue culture plates, nor were they frozen before harvesting. For the study utilizing IFN-γ activation, THP-1 cells were cultured in the presence of IFN-γ (Biosource International, Camarillo, CA) for 48 h prior to cytotoxicity analysis. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting was performed as described previously (21Francisco J.A. Gilliland L.K. Stebbins M.R. Norris N.A. Ledbetter J.A. Siegall C.B. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 3099-3104PubMed Google Scholar) using G28-5 or a control antibody at 10 μg/ml. The BD1-G28-5 sFv expression plasmid, pSE151, was constructed as described under “Experimental Procedures” and is shown in Fig.1. The crystal structure of BD1 indicated that the N terminus of BD1 is more restricted than the C terminus (14Gawlak S.L. Neubauer M. Klei H.E. Chang C.Y. Einspahr H.M. Siegall C.B. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 3095-3103Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Thus, the BD1-containing single-chain immunotoxin was constructed with G28-5 sFv fused to the C terminus of BD1. We have found previously that G28-5 sFv with the light chain variable region proceeding the heavy chain variable region, G28-5 sFv(VL-VH), resulted in 10-fold higher antigen binding activity when fused to PE40 than did the sFv in the opposite orientation, G28-5 sFv(VH-VL) (21Francisco J.A. Gilliland L.K. Stebbins M.R. Norris N.A. Ledbetter J.A. Siegall C.B. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 3099-3104PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, BD1-G28-5 sFv was constructed with the former version of the sFv. A 7-amino acid sequence (RMHGTKA) was introduced in the cloning process to separate the BD1 and G28-5 sFv moieties. This is the same linker that was used in the construction of G28-5 sFv-PE40 (21Francisco J.A. Gilliland L.K. Stebbins M.R. Norris N.A. Ledbetter J.A. Siegall C.B. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 3099-3104PubMed Google Scholar). Following expression in E. coli, insoluble inclusion bodies containing BD1-G28-5 sFv were denatured in guanidine HCl and refolded for 48 h in PBS containing 0.3 ml-arginine. After dialysis and purification through a two-step chromatographic procedure described under “Experimental Procedures,” the resulting BD1-G28-5 sFv was >95% pure as determined by non-reducing SDS-PAGE (Fig.2 A). Further analysis of the purified protein by size-exclusion chromatography (Fig. 2 B) indicated that BD1-G28-5 sFv was present as a single monomeric protein that eluted at the expected molecular mass (55 kDa). No higher molecular weight aggregates or smaller degradation products were apparent. To determine if the catalytic activity of BD1 remained intact in the single-chain immunotoxin, BD1-G28-5 sFv was compared withE. coli produced rBD1 (14Gawlak S.L. Neubauer M. Klei H.E. Chang C.Y. Einspahr H.M. Siegall C.B. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 3095-3103Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) in a cell-free protein synthesis inhibition assay. Both molecules inhibited protein synthesis with EC50 values (the concentration of protein that yielded 50% inhibition) of 2 pm (Fig. 3). These values are consistent with those previously reported for rBD1 and for native BD1 isolated from the plants (14Gawlak S.L. Neubauer M. Klei H.E. Chang C.Y. Einspahr H.M. Siegall C.B. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 3095-3103Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 15Siegall C.B. Gawlak S.L. Chace D. Wolff E.A. Mixan B. Marquardt H. Bioconjugate Chem. 1994; 5: 423-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). After ascertaining that the catalytic activity of BD1 was retained, ELISA assays were performed to evaluate the binding activity of the G28-5 sFv moiety of the fusion. Dilutions of purified BD1-G28-5 sFv were added to 96-well microtiter plates that had been coated with CD40-Ig or an isotype-matched control immunoglobulin. Wells were then probed with rabbit polyclonal anti-BD1 antiserum, followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies. BD1-G28-5 sFv specifically bound the CD40-Ig but not to the control immunoglobulin (Fig. 4). The binding of the fusion protein to CD40-Ig was completely blocked by the addition of 25 μg/ml amounts of the parental anti-CD40 antibody, G28-5, but not by the addition of an isotype-matched control antibody. BIAcore binding analysis was performed to determine the binding affinity of BD1-G28-5 sFv. These experiments showed that the apparent affinity, k d, of this monovalent fusion protein was 1.5 nm. This value is similar to that which we previously reported for G28-5 sFv-PE40 (k d = 3 nm) and is within 10-fold of the affinity (0.2 nm) of the parental G28-5 mAb (22Francisco J.A. Schreiber G.J. Comereski C.R. Mezza L.E. Warner G.L. Davidson T.J. Ledbetter J.A. Siegall C.B. Blood. 1997; 89: 4493-4500Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). CD40 is highly expressed on a variety of B-lineage malignancies, including non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHL), multiple myelomas, B-lineage leukemias and Hodgkin's disease (16Uckun F.M. Gajl-Peczalska K. Myers D.E. Jaszcz W. Haissig S. Ledbetter J.A. Blood. 1990; 76: 2449-2456Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17O'Grady J.T. Stewart S. Lowrey J. Howie S.E.M. Krajewski A.S. Am. J.

Blood. 1994; 84: 2597-2603Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The cytotoxic activity of BD1-G28-5 sFv was assessed on the CD40-expressing cell lines Raji and Daudi (NHL), T51 (lymphoblastoid), and RAM, RLO, HS-Sultan, and IM-9 (multiple myeloma). As a control, the immunotoxin was also tested on the T-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell line HPB-ALL, which does not express CD40. Raji, Daudi, and T51 cell lines were similarly sensitive to BD1-G28-5 sFv with EC50 values of 5–8 ng/ml (Fig.5 A). These values were comparable to those observed for G28-5 sFv-PE40 (21Francisco J.A. Gilliland L.K. Stebbins M.R. Norris N.A. Ledbetter J.A. Siegall C.B. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 3099-3104PubMed Google Scholar). The cytotoxicity of BD1-G28-5 sFv was inhibited by the addition of an excess (25 μg/ml) of G28-5 antibody (Fig. 5 A) but not by an isotype matched control antibody. The multiple myeloma cell lines were also sensitive to BD1-G28-5 sFv-mediated killing (Fig. 5 B). RAM, RLO, and HS-Sultan cells had EC50 values ranging from 3 to 20 ng/ml, while IM-9 cells were less sensitive with an EC50of 200 ng/ml. As with Raji, Daudi, and T51, the killing of the multiple myeloma lines could be blocked by the addition of G28-5 antibody. In contrast to the CD40-positive B-lineage malignancies, HPB-ALL cells were completely insensitive to BD1-G28-5 sFv. In addition to its expression on B-lineage malignancies, CD40 is expressed on a variety of normal cell types including monocytes (27Alderson M.R. Armitage R.J. Tough T.W. Strockbine L. Fanslow W.C. Spriggs M.K. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 178: 669-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar) and endothelial cells (28Hollenbaugh D. Mischel-Petty N. Edwards C.P. Simon J.C. Denfeld R.W. Kiener P.A. Aruffo A. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 33-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). We have shown previously that monocytic and endothelial cells were insensitive to G28-5 sFv-PE40 under normal culture conditions but could be sensitized to the immunotoxin when activated with IFN-γ or IFN-γ plus tumor necrosis factor-α, respectively (29Francisco J.A. Kiener P.K. Moran-Davis P. Ledbetter J.A. Siegall C.B. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 1652-1658PubMed Google Scholar). The effect of BD1-G28-5 sFv was tested on THP-1 monocytic cells in the absence or presence of IFN-γ activation. Without activation THP-1 cells were unaffected by BD1-G28-5 sFv at 1 μg/ml (Fig. 6). As was previously seen with G28-5 sFv-PE40, activation of the cells with 100 units/ml IFN-γ for 48 h prior to the addition of immunotoxin sensitized them to BD1-G28-5 sFv with an EC50 of 300 ng/ml. A higher concentration of IFN-γ, 1000 units/ml, sensitized the THP-1 cells even more, resulting in an EC50 of 30 ng/ml. Thus, the effect of BD1-G28-5 sFv on THP-1 cells was similar to that of G28-5 sFv-PE40 in that the cells were insensitive to the CD40-targeted immunotoxins unless activated with IFN-γ. CD40 is also expressed on a variety of solid tumors including carcinomas (19Paulie S. Ehlin-Henriksson B. Mellstedt H. Koho H. Ben-Aissa H. Perlmann P. Cancer Immunol. Immunother. 1985; 20: 23-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 20Stamenkovic I. Clark E.A. Seed B. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 1403-1410Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar), melanomas (30Thomas W.D. Smith M.J. Si Z. Hersey P. Int. J. Cancer. 1996; 68: 795-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), and Kaposi's sarcoma (31Pammer J. Plettenberg A. Weninger W. Diller B. Mildner M. Uthman A. Issing W. Stürzl M. Tschachler E. Am. J. Pathol. 1996; 148: 1387-1396PubMed Google Scholar). Fluorescence-activated cell sorting was used to identify four carcinoma cell lines, L2987 (lung), MCF-7 (breast), H3619 (colon) carcinomas, and H4021 (ovarian), that expressed CD40 (TableI). These cell lines were then tested for their sensitivity to both BD1-G28-5 sFv and G28-5 sFv-PE40. All four of the carcinoma lines were insensitive to BD1-G28-5 sFv (Table I). In contrast, these cell lines were sensitive to G28-5 sFv-PE40 with EC50 values ranging from 3 to 600 ng/ml. Activation of these carcinoma lines with cytokines did not sensitize them to BD1-G28-5 sFv (data not shown). Thus, while the effect of BD1-G28-5 sFv on CD40-positive B lineage malignancies was similar to that of G28-5 sFv-PE40, only the latter molecule had a cytotoxic effect on the CD40-expressing carcinoma cell lines.Table ICD40 expression and sensitivity of carcinoma cells to anti-CD40 and BD1-based immunotoxinsCell lineCarcinoma typeCD40 binding ratio1-aBinding ratio was determined by FACS and is defined as (mean fluorescence of G28–5 mAb binding)/(mean fluorescence of control mAb).

ND, not determined. Open table in a new tab To determine whether these carcinoma cells were resistant to BD1, cytotoxicity studies were done using a BD1-based anti-carcinoma (reactive with the Ley antigen) immunotoxin conjugate, BR96-BD1 (15Siegall C.B. Gawlak S.L. Chace D. Wolff E.A. Mixan B. Marquardt H. Bioconjugate Chem. 1994; 5: 423-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). All of the tested carcinoma lines, L2987, MCF-7, and H3619, were sensitive to BR96-BD1 with EC50 values of 15, 2, and 45 ng/ml, respectively (Table I). These data indicate that carcinoma cells were not resistant to BD1-mediated cytotoxicity and suggest that CD40 traffics BD1 differently in carcinomas than in hematologic malignancies. While immunotoxins have proven to be potent and specific cytotoxic agents in vitro and efficacious in treating animal models of human diseases in vivo, the results of clinical trials using immunotoxins have been largely disappointing. This is primarily due to toxicities in humans, most importantly vascular leak syndrome, which have limited dose escalations. The construction of new immunotoxins that have reduced toxicity would improve the clinical prospects for immunotoxins. Here, we have constructed and characterized the in vitro properties of a single-chain immunotoxin consisting of the ribosome-inactivating protein BD1 fused to the sFv region of the anti-CD40 antibody G28-5. This immunotoxin potentially represents an improvement over a previously described immunotoxin, G28-5 sFv-PE40 (21Francisco J.A. Gilliland L.K. Stebbins M.R. Norris N.A. Ledbetter J.A. Siegall C.B. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 3099-3104PubMed Google Scholar, 22Francisco J.A. Schreiber G.J. Comereski C.R. Mezza L.E. Warner G.L. Davidson T.J. Ledbetter J.A. Siegall C.B.

While both molecules have similar potency in vitro, it is likely that BD1-G28-5 sFv will be less toxic in vivo than the PE40 construct since BD1 is approximately 30-fold less toxic than PE40 (14Gawlak S.L.

Marquardt H. Bioconjugate Chem. 1994; 5: 423-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Because the x-ray crystal structure of BD1 indicated that the N terminus was more spatially constrained than the C terminus (14Gawlak S.L. Neubauer M. Klei H.E. Chang C.Y. Einspahr H.M. Siegall C.B. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 3095-3103Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), BD1-G28-5 sFv was constructed with the C terminus of BD1 fused to the N terminus of G28-5 sFv. This orientation appears to be optimal inasmuch as it yielded a molecule that retained the activities of both of the domains. In contrast, attempts to construct a similar molecule with the sFv domain preceding BD1, G28-5 sFv-BD1, failed to yield any active protein (data not shown). It is interesting to note that the sFv moiety retained a high binding affinity when positioned at either the C terminus, BD1-G28-5 sFv, or N terminus, G28-5 sFv-PE40 (22Francisco J.A. Schreiber G.J. Comereski C.R. Mezza L.E. Warner G.L. Davidson T.J. Ledbetter J.A. Siegall C.B. Blood. 1997; 89: 4493-4500Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), of a bifunctional fusion protein. It was not originally known if a single-chain immunotoxin constructed with BD1, such as BD1-G28-5 sFv, would be cytotoxic to cells without the introduction of a translocation domain. Other toxins that have been used in the construction of single-chain immunotoxins, such as diphtheria toxin and PE40, contain translocation domains that are required for the intoxication of target cells (32Siegall C.B. Ogata M. Pastan I. FitzGerald D.J. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 7154-7159Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 33Ariansen S. Afanasiev B.N. Moskaug J.O. Stenmark H. Madshus I.H. Olsnes S. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 83-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Additionally, ricin A chain-based single-chain fusion toxins have been largely ineffective (34Cook J.P. Savage P.M. Lord J.M. Roberts L.M. Bioconjugate Chem. 1993; 4: 440-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The fact that BD1-G28-5 sFv was cytotoxic to CD40-expressing NHL and multiple myeloma cells suggests that BD1 contains the function necessary to traffic the catalytic activity into the cytosol. We are presently investigating the role of a putative membrane spanning region found in amino acids 131–156 of BD1 (14Gawlak S.L. Neubauer M. Klei H.E. Chang C.Y. Einspahr H.M. Siegall C.B. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 3095-3103Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) in trafficking and translocation. Studies using the type I RIPs gelonin and saporin have shown that they too can be utilized in single-chain immunotoxins without the introduction of a translocation domain (35Lappi D.A. Ying W.

BD1-G28-5 sFv was at least as potent as G28-5 sFv-PE40 (21Francisco J.A. Gilliland L.K. Stebbins M.R. Norris N.A. Ledbetter J.A. Siegall C.B. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 3099-3104PubMed Google Scholar), which was efficacious in murine models of disseminated human NHL (22Francisco J.A. Schreiber G.J. Comereski C.R. Mezza L.E. Warner G.L. Davidson T.J. Ledbetter J.A. Siegall C.B. Blood. 1997; 89: 4493-4500Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It was unexpected that BD1-G28-5 sFv would have no cytotoxic effect on CD40-positive carcinomas in light of the fact that G28-5 sFv-PE40 was cytotoxic to these cells. We have found previously that certain cytokines or combinations of cytokines sensitized otherwise insensitive CD40-expressing cells to the cytotoxic effect of G28-5 sFv-PE40. In particular, IFN-γ and the combination of IFN-γ plus tumor necrosis factor-α were able to sensitize monocytes and endothelial cells, respectively, to G28-5 sFv-PE40 (29Francisco J.A. Kiener P.K. Moran-Davis P. Ledbetter J.A. Siegall C.B. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 1652-1658PubMed Google Scholar) and similar results were found in the present study with BD1-G28-5 sFv on monocytic cells (Fig. 6). It has also been shown that, in some cases, lysosomotropic reagents such as NH4Cl and chloroquine can enhance the killing of cells by immunotoxins (37Casellas P. Bourrie B.J.P. Gros P. Jansen F.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 9359-9364Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 38Ramakrishnan S. Houston L.L. Science. 1984; 223: 58-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). However, no conditions were found that sensitized carcinoma cells to BD1-G28-5 sFv. One possible explanation for the ineffectiveness of BD1-G28-5 sFv on carcinomas was that the cells tested were somehow naturally resistant to killing by BD1. However, three of these carcinoma lines were sensitive to an immunotoxin consisting of BD1 conjugated to the anti-carcinoma antibody BR96 (Table I). BD1 conjugated to G28-5 antibody, which was active against NHL and multiple myeloma cell lines, was not cytotoxic to carcinomas (data not shown). Thus, the fusion of BD1 to G28-5 sFv did not affect the ability of BD1 to function against the carcinoma cells since the conjugate form gave the same results as the single-chain immunotoxin. These data suggest that trafficking of BD1 mediated by CD40 differs between carcinomas and B-lineage malignancies by a mechanism that has not yet been elucidated. This is the first report detailing the utility of BD1 in the construction of a single-chain immunotoxin. It will next be important to compare the in vivo anti-tumor efficacy of BD1-G28-5 sFv with G28-5 sFv-PE40, which, along with monkey and rat toxicology studies, will define the therapeutic window of BD1-G28-5 sFv.
