(1998) Mol. Pharmacol. 53, 1068–1075). In the present study, the function of rat MRP3 was investigated using membrane vesicles isolated from LLC-PK1 and HeLa cell population transfected with corresponding cDNA. The ATP-dependent uptake of both 17β estradiol 17-β-d-glucuronide ([3H]E217βG) and glucuronide of [14C] 6-hydroxy-5,7-dimethyl-2-methylamino-4-(3-pyridylmethyl) benzothiazole (E3040), but not that of [3H]leukotriene C4 and [3H]2,4-dinitrophenyl-S-glutathione, was markedly stimulated by MRP3 transfection in both cell lines. TheK m and V max values for the uptake of [3H]E217βG were 67 ± 14 μm and 415 ± 73 pmol/min/mg of protein, respectively, for MRP3-expressing membrane vesicles and 3.0 ± 0.7 μm and 3.4 ± 0.4 pmol/min/mg of protein, respectively, for the endogenous transporter expressed on HeLa cells. [3H]E217βG had also a similarK m value for MRP3 when LLC-PK1 cells were used as the host. All glucuronide conjugates examined (E3040 glucuronide, 4-methylumbelliferone glucuronide, and naphthyl glucuronide) and methotrexate inhibited MRP3-mediated [3H]E217βG transport in LLC-PK1 cells. Moreover, [3H]methotrexate was transported via MRP3. The inhibitory effect of estrone sulfate, [3H]2,4-dinitrophenyl-S-glutathione, and [3H]leukotriene C4 was moderate or minimal, whereas N-acetyl-2,4-dinitrophenylcysteine had no effect on the uptake of [3H]E217βG. The uptake of [3H]E217βG was enhanced by E3040 sulfate and 4-methylumbelliferone sulfate. Thus we were able to demonstrate that several kinds of organic anions are transported via MRP3, although the substrate specificity of MRP3 differs from that of MRP1 and cMOAT/MRP2 in that glutathione conjugates are poor substrates for MRP3.

Among them, the GS-X pump plays an important role in cell survival (1Ishikawa T. Li Z.S. Lu Y.P. Rea P.A. Biosci. Rep. 1997; 17: 189-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Many electrophiles entering cells are conjugated with glutathione and then extruded from the cells with the aid of GS-X pumps (1Ishikawa T. Li Z.S. Lu Y.P. Rea P.A. Biosci. Rep. 1997; 17: 189-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Multidrug resistance-associated protein (MRP1), initially cloned from a multidrug resistant tumor cell line, was the first molecule to be associated with the GS-X pump activity (1Ishikawa T. Li Z.S.

The substrate specificity of MRP1 was determined in a series of transport studies using MRP1-transfected or MRP1-overexpressing cells (1Ishikawa T. Li Z.S. Lu Y.P. Rea P.A. Biosci. Rep. 1997; 17: 189-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 2Deeley R.G. Cole S.P.C. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1997; 8: 193-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 3Keppler D. König J. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 509-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). MRP1 accepts many conjugates as substrates such as glutathione conjugates (e.g.2,4-dinitrophenyl-S-glutathione (DNP-SG), glutathione disulfide, and leukotriene C4 (LTC4)), glucuronide conjugates (e.g. 17β estradiol-17β-d-glucuronide (E217βG)), and sulfated conjugates of certain bile acids (e.g.3α-sulfatolithocholyltaurine) (1Ishikawa T. Li Z.S. Lu Y.P. Rea P.A. Biosci. Rep. 1997; 17: 189-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 2Deeley R.G. Cole S.P.C. Semin.

Although MRP1 is widely expressed in many somatic cells, its hepatic expression is not marked. In the liver, canalicular multispecific organic anion transporter (cMOAT/MRP2), another member of the GS-X pump family, is expressed on the bile canalicular membrane, mediating the efficient biliary excretion of many organic anions (3Keppler D. König J. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 509-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 4Oude Elferink R.P. Meijer D.K.F. Kuipers F. Jansen P.L.M. Groen A.K. Groothuis G.M.M. Biochim. Biophys.

The similar substrate specificity of cMOAT/MRP2 and MRP1 has been established by comparing the transport properties across the bile canalicular membrane between normal rats and mutant rats whose cMOAT/MRP2 activity is hereditarily defective (e.g. transport-deficient (TR−) rats and Eisai hyperbilirubinemic rats (EHBR)) (3Keppler D. König J. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 509-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 4Oude Elferink R.P. Meijer D.K.F. Kuipers F. Jansen P.L.M. Groen A.K. Groothuis G.M.M. Biochim. Biophys.

It is possible that transporters other than cMOAT/MRP2 may be also involved in the hepatic transport of organic anions. Indeed, we were able to amplify two kinds of novel transporters, which were initially referred to as MRP-like protein (MLP) 1 and 2 from EHBR liver using RT-PCR with the degenerated primers designed for the highly conserved carboxyl-terminal ABC region of human MRP1 (17Hirohashi T. Suzuki H. Ito K. Ogawa K. Kume K. Shimizu T. Sugiyama Y. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 53: 1068-1075PubMed Google Scholar). The sequence alignment of the full-length of cDNA indicated that MLP-1 and 2 correspond to MRP6 and 3, respectively (17Hirohashi T. Suzuki H. Ito K. Ogawa K. Kume K. Shimizu T. Sugiyama Y. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 53: 1068-1075PubMed Google Scholar, 18Kool M. de Haas M. Scheffer G.L. Scheper R.J. van Eijk M.J. Juijn J.A. Baas F. Borst P. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 3537-3547PubMed Google Scholar). Northern blot analysis showed that the hepatic expression of MRP3 was significantly enhanced in EHBR compared with Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats, although the extent of MRP6 expression is comparable in the two rat strains (17Hirohashi T. Suzuki H. Ito K. Ogawa K. Kume K. Shimizu T. Sugiyama Y. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 53: 1068-1075PubMed Google Scholar). It is possible that MRP3 may compensate for the defective expression of cMOAT/MRP2 (17Hirohashi T. Suzuki H. Ito K. Ogawa K. Kume K. Shimizu T. Sugiyama Y. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 53: 1068-1075PubMed Google Scholar, 19Hirohashi T. Ogawa K. Suzuki H. Ito K. Kume K. Shimizu T. Sugiyama Y. Pharm. Res. (N. Y.). 1997; 14: S458-S459Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). In addition, because Northern blot analysis indicated that there was extensive expression of MRP3 in intestinal tissues of rats and human, it is possible that MRP3 is also responsible for the intestinal excretion of organic anions (17Hirohashi T. Suzuki H. Ito K. Ogawa K. Kume K. Shimizu T. Sugiyama Y. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 53: 1068-1075PubMed Google Scholar, 20Kiuchi Y. Suzuki H. Hirohashi T. Tyson C.A. Sugiyama Y. FEBS Lett. 1998; 433: 149-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). In the present study, we examined the function of rat MRP3 using membrane vesicles from LLC-PK1 and HeLa cells transfected with an expression vector containing the cloned MRP3 cDNA. MRP3 shows different substrate specificity to MRP1 and cMOAT/MRP2 in that glutathione conjugates are poor substrates for the former. [3H]LTC4 (111 μCi/nmol) and [3H]E217βG (55.0 μCi/nmol) were purchased from NEN Life Science Products. [3H]Methotrexate (30 μCi/nmol) was purchased from American Radiolabeled Chemicals, Inc. Unlabeled and3H-labeled DNP-SG (22.5 μCi/nmol) were synthesized enzymatically using [glycine-2-3H]glutathione (NEN Life Science Products) and 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene and glutathioneS-transferase (Sigma) as described previously (21Kobayashi K. Sogame Y. Hara H. Hayashi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7737-7741Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). [14C]E3040 glucuronide (84.5 μCi/μmol) and unlabeled E3040 glucuronide and sulfate were prepared from E3040 (supplied by Eisai Co., Ltd, Tsukuba, Japan) as described previously (22Takenaka O. Horie T. Suzuki H. Sugiyama Y. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1995; 274: 1362-1369PubMed Google Scholar). NAc-DNP-Cys was synthesized as described previously (23Hinchman C.A. Matsumoto H. Simmons T.W. Ballatori N. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22179-22185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 4-Methylumbelliferone glucuronide, 4-methylumbelliferone sulfate, LTC4, methotrexate, α-naphthyl β-d-glucuronide, estrone 3-sulfate, and acivicin were purchased from Sigma. - Rat MRP3 cDNA, excised with EcoRI from pBluescript II SK(−) vector (17Hirohashi T. Suzuki H. Ito K. Ogawa K. Kume K. Shimizu T. Sugiyama Y. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 53: 1068-1075PubMed Google Scholar), was then inserted into the EcoRI site in a mammalian expression vector (pCXN2; supplied by Dr. J. Miyazaki, Osaka University, School of Medicine) (24Niwa H. Yamamura K. Mitazaki J. Gene. 1991; 108: 193-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (4617) Google Scholar). After transfection with LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.), the LLC-PK1 and HeLa cells were maintained in the presence of 800 μg/ml G418 (Geneticin, Life Technologies) to obtain colonies. Three weeks later, the expression level of MRP3 was determined in several independently transfected cell populations using Northern blot analysis. Membrane vesicles were prepared from the cell population exhibiting the highest MRP3 expression. The cDNA fragment containing the carboxyl-terminal ABC region of rat MRP3 was prepared to undergo Northern hybridization according to the method described previously (9Ito K. Suzuki H. Hirohashi T. Kume K. Shimizu T. Sugiyama Y. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: G16-G22PubMed Google Scholar, 17Hirohashi T. Suzuki H. Ito K. Ogawa K. Kume K. Shimizu T. Sugiyama Y. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 53: 1068-1075PubMed Google Scholar). Filters were exposed to Fuji imaging plates (Fuji Photo Film Co., Ltd., Kanagawa, Japan) for 3 h at room temperature and analyzed with an imaging analyzer (BAS 2000, Fuji Photo Film Co., Ltd.). Membrane vesicles were prepared from 1 × 108 of the MRP3- and vector-transfected HeLa and LLC-PK1 cell populations as described previously (25Müller M. Zaman C.G.J. Borst P. Scheper R.J. Mulder N.H. De Vries E.G. Jansen P.L.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 13033-13037Crossref PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar). The membrane vesicles were frozen in liquid nitrogen and then transferred to a freezer (−100 °C) until required. The transport studies were performed using the rapid filtration technique (26Ishikawa T. Müller M. Klunemann C. Schaub T. Keppler D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19279-19286Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 16 μl of transport medium (10 mmTris-HCl, 250 mm sucrose, 10 mmMgCl2, pH 7.4) containing radiolabeled compounds with or without unlabeled substrate was preincubated at 37 °C for 3 min and then rapidly mixed with 4 μl of membrane vesicle suspension (8∼10 μg of protein). The reaction mixture contained 5 mm ATP or 5 mm AMP and ATP-regenerating system (10 mmcreatine phosphate, 100 μg/ml creatine phosphokinase). In some instances, the membrane vesicles were treated with acivicin (final concentration of 6 mm) at 25 °C for 15 min before initiation of the transport studies to avoid possible degradation of glutathione-S-conjugates by γ-glutamyltranspeptidase. Acivicin did not affect MRP3-mediated transport of E217βG. The transport reaction was stopped by the addition of 1 ml of ice-cold buffer containing 250 mmsucrose, 0.1 m NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4). The stopped reaction mixture was filtered through a 0.45-μm membrane filter (GVWP; Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA) and then washed twice with 5 ml of stop solution. Radioactivity retained on the filter was determined using a liquid scintillation counter (LSC-3500, Aloka Co., Tokyo, Japan). The ATP-dependent uptake of ligands was calculated by subtracting the ligand uptake in the absence of ATP from that in the presence of ATP. The expression of rat MRP3 in the transfected cells was confirmed by Northern blot analysis (Fig. 1). The length of the transcript in MRP3-transfected LLC-PK1 and HeLa cells was comparable with the band observed in Sprague-Dawley rat colon (17Hirohashi T. Suzuki H. Ito K. Ogawa K. Kume K. Shimizu T. Sugiyama Y. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 53: 1068-1075PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). The time profiles for the uptake of [3H]E217βG, [14C]E3040 glucuronide, [3H]DNP-SG, and [3H]LTC4 by the membrane vesicles from LLC-PK1 cells are shown in Fig. 2. The ATP-dependent uptake of [3H]E217βG and [14C]E3040 glucuronide at 10 min was 4.1-fold and 6.9-fold higher in MRP3-transfected LLC-PK1, respectively, compared with the control vector-transfected LLC-PK1 (Fig. 2, a and b). In contrast, the ATP-dependent uptake of [3H]DNP-SG and [3H]LTC4 was not stimulated by MRP3 transfection (Fig. 2, c andd). The same results were obtained in membrane vesicles from MRP3-transfected HeLa cells (Fig. 3). These results indicate that MRP3 preferentially accepts these two glucuronides as substrates, whereas these two glutathione conjugates are poor substrates of MRP3.Figure 3Uptake of glucuronide and glutathione conjugates into membrane vesicles. Membrane vesicles from MRP3- or vector-transfected HeLa cells were incubated at 37 °C for 10 min in medium containing 100 nm[3H]E217βG (panel a), 10 μm [14C]E3040 glucuronide (panel b), 100 nm [3H]DNP-SG (panel c), and 5 nm [3H]LTC4(panel d) in the presence (closed columns) and absence of ATP (open columns).

Nonlinear regression analysis of the uptake by MRP3- and control vector-transfected LLC-PK1 cells revealed that the saturable uptake can be described by aK m of 110 ± 20 μm andV max of 1570 ± 300 pmol/min/mg of protein and a K m of 13 ± 6 μm andV max of 35 ± 11 pmol/min/mg of protein, respectively (Fig. 4a). In MRP3- and control vector-transfected HeLa cells, kinetic parameters for the saturable uptake of [3H]E217βG were determined to beK m = 67 ± 14 μm andV max = 415 ± 73 pmol/min/mg of protein andK m = 3.0 ± 0.7 μm andV max = 3.4 ± 0.4 pmol/min/mg of protein, respectively (Fig. 4b). TableI shows the effect of anionic compounds on the ATP-dependent uptake of [3H]E217βG in MRP3-expressing LLC-PK1 and HeLa cells. The uptake was reduced by E3040 glucuronide, DNP-SG, and MTX in a concentration-dependent manner, whereas the inhibitory effect of LTC4 was only minimal in both cell lines up to 1 μm. 4-Methylumbelliferone glucuronide, α-naphthyl β-d-glucuronide, and estrone 3-sulfate had inhibitory effects on the uptake of [3H]E217βG, whereas NAc-DNP-Cys had no inhibitory effect in LLC-PK1 at a concentration of 500 μm (Table I). In contrast, E3040 sulfate and 4-methylumbelliferone sulfate enhanced the uptake of [3H]E217βG in LLC-PK1 cells (Table I).Table IEffects of various compounds on the ATP-dependent uptake of [ 3H]E217βG by membrane vesiclesInhibitorConcentration% ControlμmLLC-PK1 cellsControl100E3040 glucuronide534.9 ± 2.61019.2 ± 0.5508.5 ± 1.22002.1 ± 0.4E3040 sulfate10169.3 ± 2.550145.8 ± 5.010098.8 ± 5.550025.5 ± 0.74-Methylumbelliferone glucuronide1074.7 ± 2.25044.7 ± 0.910032.6 ± 0.750014.1 ± 0.54-Methylumbelliferone sulfate10156.5 ± 10.650321.8 ± 13.1100423.9 ± 9.6500576.7 ± 96.4MTX5059.0 ± 1.410040.0 ± 1.330022.4 ± 1.1100010.7 ± 0.9α-Naphthyl-β-d-glucuronide591.5 ± 2.22061.4 ± 2.15044.8 ± 2.020023.6 ± 0.9Estrone sulfate10100.8 ± 4.85090.8 ± 4.610077.8 ± 4.050033.3 ± 0.4NAc-DNP-Cys5102.2 ± 5.720125.2 ± 3.4100115.6 ± 1.850097.7 ± 1.9DNP-SG1090.9 ± 1.45061.4 ± 1.810046.5 ± 2.250014.4 ± 0.6LTC40.197.4 ± 4.10.2591.9 ± 3.3175.7 ± 1.52.557.0 ± 0.5HeLa cellsE3040 glucuronide262.2 ± 0.61030.2 ± 1.45011.1 ± 1.1DNP-SG579.2 ± 0.32067.8 ± 3.810040.2 ± 2.8LTC40.1104.4 ± 0.50.2587.2 ± 4.1176.9 ± 1.0MTX10057.1 ± 2.130035.2 ± 1.5100018.5 ± 1.2Membrane vesicles from MRP3-transfected LLC-PK1 or HeLa cells were incubated at 37 °C for 5 min LLC-PK1 cells or 10 min HeLa cells in medium containing 100 nm [3H]E2 17G with or without (control) the inhibitors.

Because MTX inhibited MRP3-mediated transport of [3H]E217βG, the transport of [3H]MTX was examined in membrane vesicles isolated from LLC-PK1 cells. The uptake of MTX was significantly enhanced by transfection of MRP3 (Fig. 5), indicating that MTX is a substrate for MRP3. In the present study, we examined the function of the recently cloned rat MRP3 (17Hirohashi T. Suzuki H. Ito K. Ogawa K. Kume K. Shimizu T. Sugiyama Y. Mol.

The ATP-dependent uptake of glucuronide conjugates (E217βG and E3040 glucuronide), but not that of glutathione conjugates (DNP-SG and LTC4), was markedly stimulated by MRP3 transfection (Figs. 2 and 3), indicating that MRP3 accepts the glucuronide conjugates much more readily as substrates than the glutathione conjugates. In addition, the transport characteristics of MRP3 are the same if this transporter is expressed on HeLa or LLC-PK1 cells (Figs. 2 and 3, Table I). The transport characteristics of MRP3 differ from those of MRP1 and cMOAT/MRP2 in that LTC4 is a much better substrate than E217βG for the latter two transporters. In MRP1-transfected HeLa cells, theV max/K m for the ATP-dependent uptake was 1030, 110, and 42 μl/min/mg of protein for LTC4, DNP-SG, and E217βG, respectively (27Leier I. Jedlitschky G. Buchholz U.

Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 988-994PubMed Google Scholar). This result is consistent with the finding that the V max/K m value for the ATP-dependent uptake of LTC4 was 30 times higher than that of E217βG in MRP1-transfected HEK cells (29Stride B.D. Valdimarsson G. Gerlach J.H. Wilson M. Cole S.P.C. Deeley R.G. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 49: 962-971PubMed Google Scholar). For murine mrp1, this value for LTC4 was 200 times higher than that of E217βG in the transfected HEK cells (29Stride B.D. Valdimarsson G. Gerlach J.H. Wilson M. Cole S.P.C. Deeley R.G. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 49: 962-971PubMed Google Scholar). In rat CMVs, theV max/K m for the ATP-dependent uptake of LTC4, DNP-SG, and E217βG was 268, 58, and 34 ml/min/mg of protein, respectively, indicating that the clearance for uptake mediated by cMOAT/MRP2 is 8 times higher for LTC4 than E217βG. 2K.

Kinetic analysis revealed that the K m value for MRP3 was 110 μm and 67 μm in MRP3-transfected LLC-PK1 and HeLa cells, respectively (Fig. 4), which is much higher than that reported for MRP1-transfected HeLa and HEK cells (1.5–4.8 μm) (28Jedlitschky G. Leier I. Buchholz U. Barnouin K. Kurz G. Keppler D. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 988-994PubMed Google Scholar, 29Stride B.D. Valdimarsson G. Gerlach J.H. Wilson M. Cole S.P.C. Deeley R.G. Mol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 9683-9689Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar) and in CMVs from SD rats (6.3 μm)3. We also examined the inhibitory effect of several anionic compounds on the MRP3-mediated transport of E217βG (Table I). LTC4 inhibited the transport of E217βG only minimally even at 1 μm, which is much higher than itsK m value for MRP1 (0.1 μm) (27Leier I. Jedlitschky G. Buchholz U. Cole S.P. Deeley R.G. Keppler D. J.

Chem. 1996; 271: 9675-9682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar) and cMOAT/MRP2 (0.25 μm) (26Ishikawa T. Müller M. Klunemann C. Schaub T. Keppler D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19279-19286Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Taking this together with the results of the transport studies shown in Figs. 2 and 3, LTC4 has, therefore, been shown to be a poor substrate for MRP3. α-Naphthyl β-d-glucuronide reduced the MRP3-mediated transport of E217βG with an IC50 of 20- 50 μm (Table I), consistent with the hypothesis that this compound is also recognized by MRP3. The inhibitory effect of E3040 glucuronide (IC50 < 5 μm) and 4-methylumbelliferone glucuronide (IC50 ∼ 50 μm) was in marked contrast to the stimulatory effect of the corresponding sulfates (Table I). Although the mechanism for stimulation still remains unclear, such a stimulatory effect by E3040 sulfate and 4MU sulfate has been demonstrated in uptake of DNP-SG into CMVs from SD rats (32Niinuma K. Takenaka O. Horie T. Kobayashi K. Kato Y. Suzuki H. Sugiyama Y. J. Pharm. Exp. Ther. 1997; 282: 866-872PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, the low affinity of MRP3 toward NAc-DNP-Cys suggests that MRP3 gene may not encode MOAT4, whose transport properties had previously been characterized in mouse L1210 cells (33Saxena M. Henderson G.B. Biochem. J. 1996; 320: 273-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). It has been shown that MOAT4 mediates the low affinity transport of DNP-SG (K m = 450 μm) and exhibits high sensitivity toward NAc-DNP-Cys (K i = 5.0 μm) and α-naphthyl β-d-glucuronide (K i = 8.5 μm) (33Saxena M. Henderson G.B. Biochem. J. 1996; 320: 273-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Because NAc-DNP-Cys did not affect MRP3-mediated transport, even at a concentration of 500 μm, irrespective of the fact that DNP-SG can act as an inhibitor with an IC50 of 50∼100 μm (TableI), suggests that MOAT4 differs from MRP3. Previously, we found that the expression of MRP3 is induced in EHBR liver (17Hirohashi T. Suzuki H. Ito K. Ogawa K. Kume K. Shimizu T. Sugiyama Y. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 53: 1068-1075PubMed Google Scholar). It is also induced in SD rat liver by phenobarbital treatment and by treatment which increases plasma bilirubin and/or its glucuronide (e.g. the cholestasis induced by common bile duct ligation and by α-naphthylisothiocyanate treatment) (17Hirohashi T. Suzuki H. Ito K. Ogawa K. Kume K. Shimizu T. Sugiyama Y. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 53: 1068-1075PubMed Google Scholar, 19Hirohashi T. Ogawa K. Suzuki H. Ito K. Kume K. Shimizu T. Sugiyama Y. Pharm. Res. (N. Y.). 1997; 14: S458-S459Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). It is plausible that, in EHBR, MRP3 is induced to compensate for the physiological function of cMOAT/MRP2 to excrete bilirubin glucuronides from hepatocytes (17Hirohashi T. Suzuki H. Ito K. Ogawa K. Kume K. Shimizu T. Sugiyama Y. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 53: 1068-1075PubMed Google Scholar, 19Hirohashi T. Ogawa K. Suzuki H. Ito K. Kume K. Shimizu T. Sugiyama Y. Pharm. Res. (N. Y.). 1997; 14: S458-S459Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). This hypothesis has been proposed from the previous finding that, in mdr 1a knock-out mice, the hepatic function of mdr 1a is compensated for by the increased expression of mdr 1b, whose substrate specificity resembles that of mdr 1a (34Schinkel A.H. Smit J.J. van Tellingen O. Beijnen J.H. Wagenaar E. van Deemter E. Mol C.A. van der Valk M.A. Robanus-Maandag E.C. te Riele H.P. Berms A.J.M. Borst P. Cell. 1994; 77: 491-502Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2089) Google Scholar). Although we reported that E3040 glucuronide is taken up by CMVs from EHBR in an ATP-dependent manner (32Niinuma K. Takenaka O. Horie T. Kobayashi K. Kato Y. Suzuki H. Sugiyama Y. J. Pharm. Exp. Ther. 1997; 282: 866-872PubMed Google Scholar), the comparison of the transport properties between CMVs and MRP3-expressing membrane vesicles suggested that the uptake into EHBR CMVs may not be mediated by MRP3. This suggestion was proposed based on the finding that neither the uptake of E217βG 3A. Morikawa, H. Suzuki, T. Hirohashi, and Y. Sugiyama, unpublished observation. nor MTX (35Masuda M. Iizuka Y. Yamazaki M. Nishigaki R. Kato Y. Niinuma K. Suzuki H. Sugiyama Y. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 3506-3510PubMed Google Scholar) was stimulated by the addition of ATP if CMVs were isolated from EHBR. Together with the finding that all of the E217βG, E3040 glucuronide, and MTX are transported via MRP3 (Figs. 2, 3, and 5) suggests that the previously described ATP-dependent transport of E3040 glucuronide in CMVs from EHBR should be attributed to another transporter. The extensive expression of MRP3 in rat and human intestinal tissues may be related to the intestinal excretion of glucuronides. Indeed, intestinal excretion of ethinylestradiol glucuronide (36Schwenk M. Schiemenz C. del Pino V.L. Remmer H. Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Arch. Pharmacol. 1982; 321: 223-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) and 1-naphthol glucuronide (37de Vries M.H. Hofman G.A. Koster A.S. Noordhoek J. Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Arch. Pharmacol. 1989; 340: 239-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) has been demonstrated in rats in in situ experiments. In addition, the extent of excretion of 1-naphthol glucuronide was comparable in normal and cMOAT/MRP2-deficient rats, suggesting the presence of another transporter responsible for the excretion of this glucuronide (38de Vries M.H. Redegeld F.A. Koster A.S. Noordhoek J. de Haan J.G. Oude Elferink R.P. Jansen P.L. Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Arch. Pharmacol. 1989; 340: 588-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). It is possible that MRP3 is responsible for the intestinal excretion of this conjugated metabolite. In conclusion, although MRP3 mediates the transport of several kinds of organic anions, the substrate specificity of MRP3 is in marked contrast to that of MRP1 and cMOAT/MRP2 in that glutathione conjugates are poor substrates for MRP3. It is possible that MRP3 acts as an inducible transporter compensating for the cMOAT/MRP2 function. In addition, MRP3 may be responsible for the cellular extrusion of glucuronide conjugates in the small intestine."

The interaction was confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation of native RACK1 and PDE4D5 from COS7, HEK293, 3T3-F442A, and SK-N-SH cell lines. The interaction was unaffected by stimulation of the cells with the phorbol ester phorbol 2-myristate 3-acetate. PDE4D5 did not interact with two other WD-repeat proteins, β'-coatomer protein and Gsβ, in two-hybrid tests. RACK1 did not interact with other PDE4D isoforms or with known PDE4A, PDE4B, and PDE4C isoforms. PDE4D5 and RACK1 interacted with high affinity (K a approximately 7 pm) when they were expressed and purified from Escherichia coli, demonstrating that the interaction does not require intermediate proteins. The binding of the E. coli-expressed proteins did not alter the kinetics of cAMP hydrolysis by PDE4D5 but caused a 3–4-fold change in its sensitivity to inhibition by the PDE4 selective inhibitor rolipram. The subcellular distributions of RACK1 and PDE4D5 were extremely similar, with the major amount of both proteins (70%) in the high speed supernatant (S2) fraction. Analysis of constructs with specific deletions or single amino acid mutations in PDE4D5 demonstrated that a small cluster of amino acids in the unique amino-terminal region of PDE4D5 was necessary for its interaction with RACK1. We suggest that RACK1 may act as a scaffold protein to recruit PDE4D5 and other proteins into a signaling complex.

Modulation of the levels of the second messenger cAMP in cells is important in the regulation of numerous physiological processes, including those in the immune/inflammatory systems, vascular smooth muscle, and the brain.

Physiol. Rev. 1995; 75: 725-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (1634) Google Scholar). The cAMP-specific phosphodiesterases (PDE4s) can be differentiated from other PDEs by sequence homology of the catalytic region of the enzymes (2Houslay M.D. Sullivan M. Bolger G.B. Adv. Pharmacol. 1998; 44: 225-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar) and by their ability to be specifically inhibited by the drug rolipram. Rolipram and other specific PDE4 inhibitors have been shown to have anti-depressant, anti-inflammatory, and smooth muscle relaxant activity in humans (2Houslay M.D. Sullivan M. Bolger G.B. Adv. Pharmacol. 1998; 44: 225-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). The PDE4 enzymes are also characterized by the presence of unique regions of amino acid sequence outside the catalytic region of the proteins, which are called upstream conserved regions 1 and 2 (UCR1 and UCR2) and are located in the amino-terminal half of the proteins (3Bolger G. Michaeli T. Martins T. St. John T. Steiner B. Rodgers L. Riggs M. Wigler M. Ferguson K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6558-6571Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). The PDE4s are comprised of a large family of isoforms, encoded by four different genes (PDE4A, PDE4B, PDE4C, and PDE4D) in humans, with additional diversity being generated by alternative mRNA splicing (2Houslay M.D. Sullivan M. Bolger G.B. Adv. Pharmacol. 1998; 44: 225-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar).We and other groups (3Bolger G. Michaeli T. Martins T. St. John T. Steiner B. Rodgers L. Riggs M. Wigler M.

J. 1997; 328: 539-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar) have characterized five different isoforms encoded by the human PDE4D gene, all of which appear to be conserved among mammals (6Sette C.

Chem. 1998; 273: 19672-19678Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The five isoforms differ by the substitution of unique blocks of amino acids at the amino-terminal regions of their respective proteins (5Bolger G.B. Erdogan S. Jones R.E. Loughney K. Wilkinson I. Scotland G. Hoffman R. Farrell C. Houslay M.D. Biochem. J. 1997; 328: 539-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). The two smaller PDE4D isoforms, PDE4D1 and PDE4D2, are located exclusively in the cytosolic fraction of the cell (5Bolger G.B. Erdogan S. Jones R.E. Loughney K. Wilkinson I. Scotland G. Hoffman R. Farrell C. Houslay M.D. Biochem. J. 1997; 328: 539-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 7Jin S.-L.C. Bushnik T. Lan L. Conti M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19672-19678Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The larger isoforms PDE4D3, PDE4D4, and PDE4D5 are each found both in the cytosol as well as in association with cellular particulate fractions (5Bolger G.B. Erdogan S. Jones R.E. Loughney K. Wilkinson I. Scotland G. Hoffman R. Farrell C. Houslay M.D. Biochem. J. 1997; 328: 539-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 7Jin S.-L.C. Bushnik T. Lan L. Conti M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19672-19678Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The functional consequences of this diversity are poorly understood. However, the PDE4D3 isoform is a substrate for protein kinase A (PKA), which serves to activate this isoform (6Sette C. Vicini E. Conti M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18271-18274Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Sette C. Iona S. Conti M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9245-9252Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Sette C.

J. 1998; 333: 139-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar).In this study, we identify a novel property of a different PDE4D isoform, PDE4D5. This human isoform was recently isolated by us and is found in a variety of tissues and cell types, including the brain (5Bolger G.B. Erdogan S. Jones R.E. Loughney K. Wilkinson I. Scotland G. Hoffman R. Farrell C. Houslay M.D. Biochem. J. 1997; 328: 539-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). PDE4D5 can be distinguished from other PDE4D isoforms by the presence of a unique amino-terminal region of 88 amino acids (5Bolger G.B. Erdogan S. Jones R.E. Loughney K. Wilkinson I. Scotland G. Hoffman R. Farrell C. Houslay M.D. Biochem. J. 1997; 328: 539-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). We now demonstrate that PDE4D5 interacts specifically and with high affinity with the RACK1 protein (receptor for activated C-kinase). RACK1 is a 36-kDa WD-repeat protein (11Neer E.J. Schmidt C.J. Nambudripad R. Smith T.F. Nature. 1994; 371: 297-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (1284) Google Scholar) that binds to certain protein kinase C (PKC) isoforms subsequent to their activation by diacylglycerol or phorbol esters such as PMA. RACK1 appears to serve as a “scaffold” or “anchor” protein for these PKC isoforms (12Ron D. Chen C.H. Caldwell J. Jamieson L. Orr E. Mochly Rosen D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 839-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (642) Google Scholar, 13Ron D. Mochly Rosen D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 492-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 14Ron D. Luo J.

Science. 1995; 268: 247-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (832) Google Scholar). Recently, RACK1 has been shown to interact with the β subunit of integrins (16Liliental J. Chang D.D. J Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2379-2383Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar) and the Src protein tyrosyl kinase (17Chang B.Y. Conroy K.B. Machleder E.M. Cartwright C.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3245-3256Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Scaffold and anchor proteins physically connect various signal transduction components, such as receptors, kinases, and elements of the cytoskeleton, into stable complexes (18Pawson T. Scott J.D. Science. 1997; 278: 2075-2080Crossref PubMed Scopus (1887) Google Scholar). Our data suggest that RACK1 may recruit the PDE4D5 isoform into a such a complex in a variety of cell types.DISCUSSIONRegulation of the levels of the second messenger cAMP has the potential to influence multiple processes in cells and tissues. PDE4 enzymes have been implicated in numerous cellular functions in the brain, airway smooth muscle, endocrine tissues, and in the immune/inflammatory systems (for review see Ref. 2Houslay M.D. Sullivan M. Bolger G.B. Adv. Pharmacol. 1998; 44: 225-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). However, the regulation of many PDE4 isoforms is poorly understood. We have recently isolated a novel PDE4 isoform, PDE4D5, which is expressed in numerous cell lines and also in the brain (5Bolger G.B. Erdogan S. Jones R.E. Loughney K. Wilkinson I. Scotland G. Hoffman R. Farrell C. Houslay M.D. Biochem. J. 1997; 328: 539-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). In the present study, we have demonstrated that PDE4D5 interacts specifically and at high affinity with the RACK1 WD-repeat scaffold protein. The interaction between these two proteins was demonstrated by multiple independent methods, including two-hybrid screening, pull-down assays with recombinant RACK1, and binding studies with purified recombinant proteins. We have also demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation studies that native, endogenously expressed RACK1 and PDE4D5 interact in cells.The term RACK1 stands for receptor for activated protein C kinase, and the first identified functional role for RACK1 was as a protein capable of binding to various PKC isoforms after they had been activated through treatment of cells with either diacylglycerol or phorbol esters (12Ron D.

It is a member of the large family of WD-repeat proteins (11Neer E.J. Schmidt C.J. Nambudripad R. Smith T.F. Nature. 1994; 371: 297-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (1284) Google Scholar), which have numerous functions in cells. It is most homologous to the Gsβ subunit, which activates certain isoforms of adenylyl cyclase and various ion channels (11Neer E.J. Schmidt C.J. Nambudripad R. Smith T.F.

X-ray diffraction studies of the Gsβ subunit have demonstrated that it is has a “propeller” structure (44Lambright D.G. Sondek J. Bohm A. Skiba N.P. Hamm H.E. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1996; 379: 311-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (1044) Google Scholar, 45Wall M.A. Coleman D.E. Lee E. Iniguez Lluhi J.A. Posner B.A. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Cell. 1995; 83: 1047-1058Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1005) Google Scholar), and the “blades” of the propeller are believed to be sites of interaction between Gsβ and other proteins. It is likely that RACK1 has a similar structure (46Garcia Higuera I. Fenoglio J. Li Y. Lewis C. Panchenko M.P. Reiner O. Smith T.F. Neer E.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13985-13994Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). The coatomer protein β‘-COP is also a WD-repeat protein that also interacts with PKC isoforms (35Csukai M. Chen C.-H. De Matteis M.A. Mochly-Rosen D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29200-29206Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). However, we have shown that PDE4D5 does not bind to either Gsβ or β‘-COP, demonstrating that PDE4D5 interacts specifically with RACK1 and not with WD-repeat proteins in general.More recently, RACK1 has been shown to interact with the integrin β subunit (16Liliental J. Chang D.D. J Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2379-2383Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar) and the protein tyrosyl kinase Src (17Chang B.Y. Conroy K.B. Machleder E.M. Cartwright C.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3245-3256Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). RACK1 may serve as a scaffold or “adaptor” protein for either Src or the integrin β subunit. Overexpression of RACK1 inhibits the tyrosine kinase activity of Src and inhibits the growth of NIH-3T3 cells (17Chang B.Y. Conroy K.B. Machleder E.M. Cartwright C.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3245-3256Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The physiologic role of RACK1 in integrin function remains to be determined (see below).Although RACK1 has been shown to interact with at least four different proteins, the mechanisms for these interactions appear to be quite different. PKC isoforms need to be activated by treatment with phorbol esters and Ca2+ before they can interact with RACK1 (47Mochly Rosen D. Khaner H. Lopez J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3997-4000Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). This treatment is believed to produce a conformational change in the PKC enzyme, which exposes its C2 region, allowing it to interact with RACK1 (13Ron D. Mochly Rosen D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 492-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 14Ron D. Luo J. Mochly Rosen D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24180-24187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar, 15Mochly Rosen D. Science. 1995; 268: 247-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (832) Google Scholar). A number of domains within the C2 region of PKC are involved in its binding to RACK1 (13Ron D. Mochly Rosen D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 492-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 14Ron D. Luo J. Mochly Rosen D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24180-24187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). These domains show no obvious sequence homology to the region in the amino terminus of PDE4D5 that we have shown to be essential for its interaction with RACK1 (Figs. 6 and 7). The interaction of RACK1 with the β subunit of integrins also requires the stimulation of cells with PMA (16Liliental J. Chang D.D. J Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2379-2383Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). This suggests that PKC activation is necessary for the interaction of the integrin β subunit with RACK1 or that PMA can directly promote the interaction. This interaction may involve a conformational change in RACK1, as the interaction between RACK1 and the integrin β subunit can only be demonstrated in vitro if a truncated form (WD-repeats 5–7, inclusive) of RACK1 is used.In some ways, the interaction that we observe between PDE4D5 and RACK1 appears to resemble that between RACK1 and the SH2 region of Src (17Chang B.Y. Conroy K.B. Machleder E.M. Cartwright C.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3245-3256Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Src interacts with full-length GST-RACK1 in pull-down assays, which is also true for PDE4D5 (Figs. 3, 4, and 7). Co-immunoprecipitation of Src and RACK1 from cell lysates did not require PMA, which is also true for the interaction between RACK1 and PDE4D5. Therefore, RACK1 may interact with different proteins through different mechanisms, some of which involve phorbol ester-induced conformational changes and some of which apparently do not.Several other PDE4 isoforms have also been demonstrated to bind to other signaling proteins, and it is of interest that these interactions also appear to be mediated by sequences in the unique amino-terminal ends of the PDE4 proteins. The PDE4A4/5 isoform has been demonstrated to bind to proteins containing SH3 domains (38O'Connell J.C. McCallum J.F. McPhee I. Wakefield J. Houslay E.S. Wishart W. Bolger G. Frame M. Houslay M.D. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 255-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The PDE4A1 isoform is targeted to membranes, and the membrane targeting of this isoform is mediated by specific amino acids in its amino-terminal region (27McPhee I. Pooley L. Lobban M. Bolger G. Houslay M.D. Biochem. J. 1995; 310: 965-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 28Shakur Y. Pryde J.G. Houslay M.D. Biochem. J. 1993; 292: 677-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 29Shakur Y. Wilson M. Pooley L. Lobban M. Griffiths S.L. Campbell A.M. Beattie J. Daly C. Houslay M.D. Biochem. J. 1995; 306: 801-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar,48Scotland G. Houslay M.D. Biochem. J. 1995; 308: 673-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar).The physiologic implications of the RACK1-PDE4D5 interaction may be related to the ability of RACK1 to serve as a scaffold or adaptor protein that mediates the recruitment of PDE4D5 into a protein complex. A single scaffold or adaptor protein may interact with multiple different proteins, all of which can potentially be recruited into the complex. For example, protein kinase A-anchoring proteins can interact with protein kinase A, PKC, and protein phosphatase 1 (18Pawson T. Scott J.D. Science. 1997; 278: 2075-2080Crossref PubMed Scopus (1887) Google Scholar, 49Rubin C.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1224: 467-479PubMed Google Scholar). Scaffold, anchor, and adaptor proteins physically connect various signal transduction components, such as receptors, kinases, and elements of the cytoskeleton, into stable complexes. These complexes bring enzymes closer to their regulatory components or substrates or closer to other components of a signaling network (18Pawson T. Scott J.D. Science. 1997; 278: 2075-2080Crossref PubMed Scopus (1887) Google Scholar). Therefore, the multidomain protein RACK1 may serve as a scaffold able to recruit a variety of signal transduction proteins. Some partners of RACK1, such as PKC isoforms and integrins, may be recruited to the complex only upon activation by phorbol esters, whereas others, such as PDE4D5 and Src, may be constitutively associated with RACK1 in those cell types where both proteins are expressed. The functional significance of the association of PDE4D5 with RACK1 remains to be elucidated. The recruitment of PDE4D5 to a signaling complex may provide a potential mechanism for the modulation of cAMP levels in the vicinity of the complex. This could in turn regulate the activity of protein kinase A, which could influence the activity or function(s) of the complex, or of other adjacent cellular components. Modulation of the levels of the second messenger cAMP in cells is important in the regulation of numerous physiological processes, including those in the immune/inflammatory systems, vascular smooth muscle, and the brain.

Physiol. Rev. 1995; 75: 725-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (1634) Google Scholar). The cAMP-specific phosphodiesterases (PDE4s) can be differentiated from other PDEs by sequence homology of the catalytic region of the enzymes (2Houslay M.D. Sullivan M. Bolger G.B. Adv. Pharmacol. 1998; 44: 225-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar) and by their ability to be specifically inhibited by the drug rolipram. Rolipram and other specific PDE4 inhibitors have been shown to have anti-depressant, anti-inflammatory, and smooth muscle relaxant activity in humans (2Houslay M.D. Sullivan M. Bolger G.B. Adv. Pharmacol. 1998; 44: 225-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). The PDE4 enzymes are also characterized by the presence of unique regions of amino acid sequence outside the catalytic region of the proteins, which are called upstream conserved regions 1 and 2 (UCR1 and UCR2) and are located in the amino-terminal half of the proteins (3Bolger G. Michaeli T. Martins T. St. John T. Steiner B. Rodgers L. Riggs M. Wigler M. Ferguson K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6558-6571Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). The PDE4s are comprised of a large family of isoforms, encoded by four different genes (PDE4A, PDE4B, PDE4C, and PDE4D) in humans, with additional diversity being generated by alternative mRNA splicing (2Houslay M.D. Sullivan M. Bolger G.B. Adv. Pharmacol. 1998; 44: 225-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). We and other groups (3Bolger G. Michaeli T. Martins T. St. John T. Steiner B. Rodgers L. Riggs M. Wigler M.

J. 1997; 328: 539-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar) have characterized five different isoforms encoded by the human PDE4D gene, all of which appear to be conserved among mammals (6Sette C.

Chem. 1998; 273: 19672-19678Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The five isoforms differ by the substitution of unique blocks of amino acids at the amino-terminal regions of their respective proteins (5Bolger G.B. Erdogan S. Jones R.E. Loughney K. Wilkinson I. Scotland G. Hoffman R. Farrell C. Houslay M.D. Biochem. J. 1997; 328: 539-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). The two smaller PDE4D isoforms, PDE4D1 and PDE4D2, are located exclusively in the cytosolic fraction of the cell (5Bolger G.B. Erdogan S. Jones R.E. Loughney K. Wilkinson I. Scotland G. Hoffman R. Farrell C. Houslay M.D. Biochem. J. 1997; 328: 539-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 7Jin S.-L.C. Bushnik T. Lan L. Conti M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19672-19678Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The larger isoforms PDE4D3, PDE4D4, and PDE4D5 are each found both in the cytosol as well as in association with cellular particulate fractions (5Bolger G.B. Erdogan S. Jones R.E. Loughney K. Wilkinson I. Scotland G. Hoffman R. Farrell C. Houslay M.D. Biochem. J. 1997; 328: 539-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 7Jin S.-L.C. Bushnik T. Lan L. Conti M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19672-19678Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The functional consequences of this diversity are poorly understood. However, the PDE4D3 isoform is a substrate for protein kinase A (PKA), which serves to activate this isoform (6Sette C. Vicini E. Conti M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18271-18274Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Sette C. Iona S. Conti M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9245-9252Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Sette C.

J. 1998; 333: 139-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). In this study, we identify a novel property of a different PDE4D isoform, PDE4D5. This human isoform was recently isolated by us and is found in a variety of tissues and cell types, including the brain (5Bolger G.B. Erdogan S. Jones R.E. Loughney K. Wilkinson I. Scotland G. Hoffman R. Farrell C. Houslay M.D. Biochem. J. 1997; 328: 539-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). PDE4D5 can be distinguished from other PDE4D isoforms by the presence of a unique amino-terminal region of 88 amino acids (5Bolger G.B. Erdogan S. Jones R.E. Loughney K. Wilkinson I. Scotland G. Hoffman R. Farrell C. Houslay M.D. Biochem. J. 1997; 328: 539-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). We now demonstrate that PDE4D5 interacts specifically and with high affinity with the RACK1 protein (receptor for activated C-kinase). RACK1 is a 36-kDa WD-repeat protein (11Neer E.J. Schmidt C.J. Nambudripad R. Smith T.F. Nature. 1994; 371: 297-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (1284) Google Scholar) that binds to certain protein kinase C (PKC) isoforms subsequent to their activation by diacylglycerol or phorbol esters such as PMA. RACK1 appears to serve as a “scaffold” or “anchor” protein for these PKC isoforms (12Ron D. Chen C.H. Caldwell J. Jamieson L. Orr E. Mochly Rosen D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 839-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (642) Google Scholar, 13Ron D. Mochly Rosen D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 492-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 14Ron D. Luo J.

Science. 1995; 268: 247-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (832) Google Scholar). Recently, RACK1 has been shown to interact with the β subunit of integrins (16Liliental J. Chang D.D. J Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2379-2383Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar) and the Src protein tyrosyl kinase (17Chang B.Y. Conroy K.B. Machleder E.M. Cartwright C.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3245-3256Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Scaffold and anchor proteins physically connect various signal transduction components, such as receptors, kinases, and elements of the cytoskeleton, into stable complexes (18Pawson T. Scott J.D. Science. 1997; 278: 2075-2080Crossref PubMed Scopus (1887) Google Scholar). Our data suggest that RACK1 may recruit the PDE4D5 isoform into a such a complex in a variety of cell types. DISCUSSIONRegulation of the levels of the second messenger cAMP has the potential to influence multiple processes in cells and tissues. PDE4 enzymes have been implicated in numerous cellular functions in the brain, airway smooth muscle, endocrine tissues, and in the immune/inflammatory systems (for review see Ref. 2Houslay M.D. Sullivan M. Bolger G.B. Adv. Pharmacol. 1998; 44: 225-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). However, the regulation of many PDE4 isoforms is poorly understood. We have recently isolated a novel PDE4 isoform, PDE4D5, which is expressed in numerous cell lines and also in the brain (5Bolger G.B. Erdogan S. Jones R.E. Loughney K. Wilkinson I. Scotland G. Hoffman R. Farrell C. Houslay M.D. Biochem. J. 1997; 328: 539-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). In the present study, we have demonstrated that PDE4D5 interacts specifically and at high affinity with the RACK1 WD-repeat scaffold protein. The interaction between these two proteins was demonstrated by multiple independent methods, including two-hybrid screening, pull-down assays with recombinant RACK1, and binding studies with purified recombinant proteins. We have also demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation studies that native, endogenously expressed RACK1 and PDE4D5 interact in cells.The term RACK1 stands for receptor for activated protein C kinase, and the first identified functional role for RACK1 was as a protein capable of binding to various PKC isoforms after they had been activated through treatment of cells with either diacylglycerol or phorbol esters (12Ron D.

It is a member of the large family of WD-repeat proteins (11Neer E.J. Schmidt C.J. Nambudripad R. Smith T.F. Nature. 1994; 371: 297-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (1284) Google Scholar), which have numerous functions in cells. It is most homologous to the Gsβ subunit, which activates certain isoforms of adenylyl cyclase and various ion channels (11Neer E.J. Schmidt C.J. Nambudripad R. Smith T.F. Nature. 1994; 371: 297-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (1284) Google Scholar, 42Sunahara R.K. Dessauer C.W. Gilman A.G. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol.

X-ray diffraction studies of the Gsβ subunit have demonstrated that it is has a “propeller” structure (44Lambright D.G. Sondek J. Bohm A. Skiba N.P. Hamm H.E. Sigler P.B.

Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13985-13994Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). The coatomer protein β‘-COP is also a WD-repeat protein that also interacts with PKC isoforms (35Csukai M. Chen C.-H. De Matteis M.A. Mochly-Rosen D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29200-29206Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar).

The PDE4A1 isoform is targeted to membranes, and the membrane targeting of this isoform is mediated by specific amino acids in its amino-terminal region (27McPhee I. Pooley L. Lobban M. Bolger G. Houslay M.D. Biochem. J. 1995; 310: 965-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 28Shakur Y. Pryde J.G. Houslay M.D. Biochem.

J. 1995; 308: 673-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar).The physiologic implications of the RACK1-PDE4D5 interaction may be related to the ability of RACK1 to serve as a scaffold or adaptor protein that mediates the recruitment of PDE4D5 into a protein complex. A single scaffold or adaptor protein may interact with multiple different proteins, all of which can potentially be recruited into the complex. For example, protein kinase A-anchoring proteins can interact with protein kinase A, PKC, and protein phosphatase 1 (18Pawson T. Scott J.D. Science. 1997; 278: 2075-2080Crossref PubMed Scopus (1887) Google Scholar, 49Rubin C.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1224: 467-479PubMed Google Scholar). Scaffold, anchor, and adaptor proteins physically connect various signal transduction components, such as receptors, kinases, and elements of the cytoskeleton, into stable complexes. These complexes bring enzymes closer to their regulatory components or substrates or closer to other components of a signaling network (18Pawson T. Scott J.D. Science. 1997; 278: 2075-2080Crossref PubMed Scopus (1887) Google Scholar). Therefore, the multidomain protein RACK1 may serve as a scaffold able to recruit a variety of signal transduction proteins. Some partners of RACK1, such as PKC isoforms and integrins, may be recruited to the complex only upon activation by phorbol esters, whereas others, such as PDE4D5 and Src, may be constitutively associated with RACK1 in those cell types where both proteins are expressed. The functional significance of the association of PDE4D5 with RACK1 remains to be elucidated. The recruitment of PDE4D5 to a signaling complex may provide a potential mechanism for the modulation of cAMP levels in the vicinity of the complex. This could in turn regulate the activity of protein kinase A, which could influence the activity or function(s) of the complex, or of other adjacent cellular components. Regulation of the levels of the second messenger cAMP has the potential to influence multiple processes in cells and tissues. PDE4 enzymes have been implicated in numerous cellular functions in the brain, airway smooth muscle, endocrine tissues, and in the immune/inflammatory systems (for review see Ref. 2Houslay M.D. Sullivan M. Bolger G.B. Adv. Pharmacol. 1998; 44: 225-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). However, the regulation of many PDE4 isoforms is poorly understood. We have recently isolated a novel PDE4 isoform, PDE4D5, which is expressed in numerous cell lines and also in the brain (5Bolger G.B. Erdogan S. Jones R.E. Loughney K. Wilkinson I. Scotland G. Hoffman R. Farrell C. Houslay M.D. Biochem. J. 1997; 328: 539-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). In the present study, we have demonstrated that PDE4D5 interacts specifically and at high affinity with the RACK1 WD-repeat scaffold protein. The interaction between these two proteins was demonstrated by multiple independent methods, including two-hybrid screening, pull-down assays with recombinant RACK1, and binding studies with purified recombinant proteins. We have also demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation studies that native, endogenously expressed RACK1 and PDE4D5 interact in cells. The term RACK1 stands for receptor for activated protein C kinase, and the first identified functional role for RACK1 was as a protein capable of binding to various PKC isoforms after they had been activated through treatment of cells with either diacylglycerol or phorbol esters (12Ron D.

It is a member of the large family of WD-repeat proteins (11Neer E.J. Schmidt C.J. Nambudripad R. Smith T.F. Nature. 1994; 371: 297-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (1284) Google Scholar), which have numerous functions in cells. It is most homologous to the Gsβ subunit, which activates certain isoforms of adenylyl cyclase and various ion channels (11Neer E.J. Schmidt C.J. Nambudripad R. Smith T.F. Nature. 1994; 371: 297-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (1284) Google Scholar, 42Sunahara R.K. Dessauer C.W. Gilman A.G. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1996; 36: 461-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (732) Google Scholar) and which also serves as an anchor for the β-adrenergic receptor kinase (43Pitcher J.A. Inglese J. Higgins J.B. Arriza J.L. Casey P.J. Kim C. Benovic J.L. Kwatra M.M. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Science. 1992; 257: 1264-1267Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar). X-ray diffraction studies of the Gsβ subunit have demonstrated that it is has a “propeller” structure (44Lambright D.G. Sondek J. Bohm A. Skiba N.P. Hamm H.E. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1996; 379: 311-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (1044) Google Scholar, 45Wall M.A. Coleman D.E. Lee E. Iniguez Lluhi J.A. Posner B.A. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Cell. 1995; 83: 1047-1058Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1005) Google Scholar), and the “blades” of the propeller are believed to be sites of interaction between Gsβ and other proteins. It is likely that RACK1 has a similar structure (46Garcia Higuera I. Fenoglio J. Li Y. Lewis C. Panchenko M.P. Reiner O. Smith T.F. Neer E.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13985-13994Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). The coatomer protein β‘-COP is also a WD-repeat protein that also interacts with PKC isoforms (35Csukai M. Chen C.-H. De Matteis M.A. Mochly-Rosen D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29200-29206Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). However, we have shown that PDE4D5 does not bind to either Gsβ or β‘-COP, demonstrating that PDE4D5 interacts specifically with RACK1 and not with WD-repeat proteins in general. More recently, RACK1 has been shown to interact with the integrin β subunit (16Liliental J. Chang D.D. J Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2379-2383Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar) and the protein tyrosyl kinase Src (17Chang B.Y. Conroy K.B. Machleder E.M. Cartwright C.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3245-3256Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). RACK1 may serve as a scaffold or “adaptor” protein for either Src or the integrin β subunit. Overexpression of RACK1 inhibits the tyrosine kinase activity of Src and inhibits the growth of NIH-3T3 cells (17Chang B.Y. Conroy K.B. Machleder E.M. Cartwright C.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3245-3256Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The physiologic role of RACK1 in integrin function remains to be determined (see below). Although RACK1 has been shown to interact with at least four different proteins, the mechanisms for these interactions appear to be quite different. PKC isoforms need to be activated by treatment with phorbol esters and Ca2+ before they can interact with RACK1 (47Mochly Rosen D. Khaner H. Lopez J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3997-4000Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). This treatment is believed to produce a conformational change in the PKC enzyme, which exposes its C2 region, allowing it to interact with RACK1 (13Ron D. Mochly Rosen D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 492-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 14Ron D. Luo J. Mochly Rosen D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24180-24187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar, 15Mochly Rosen D. Science. 1995; 268: 247-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (832) Google Scholar). A number of domains within the C2 region of PKC are involved in its binding to RACK1 (13Ron D. Mochly Rosen D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 492-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 14Ron D. Luo J. Mochly Rosen D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24180-24187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). These domains show no obvious sequence homology to the region in the amino terminus of PDE4D5 that we have shown to be essential for its interaction with RACK1 (Figs. 6 and 7). The interaction of RACK1 with the β subunit of integrins also requires the stimulation of cells with PMA (16Liliental J. Chang D.D. J Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2379-2383Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). This suggests that PKC activation is necessary for the interaction of the integrin β subunit with RACK1 or that PMA can directly promote the interaction. This interaction may involve a conformational change in RACK1, as the interaction between RACK1 and the integrin β subunit can only be demonstrated in vitro if a truncated form (WD-repeats 5–7, inclusive) of RACK1 is used. In some ways, the interaction that we observe between PDE4D5 and RACK1 appears to resemble that between RACK1 and the SH2 region of Src (17Chang B.Y. Conroy K.B. Machleder E.M. Cartwright C.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3245-3256Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Src interacts with full-length GST-RACK1 in pull-down assays, which is also true for PDE4D5 (Figs. 3, 4, and 7). Co-immunoprecipitation of Src and RACK1 from cell lysates did not require PMA, which is also true for the interaction between RACK1 and PDE4D5. Therefore, RACK1 may interact with different proteins through different mechanisms, some of which involve phorbol ester-induced conformational changes and some of which apparently do not. Several other PDE4 isoforms have also been demonstrated to bind to other signaling proteins, and it is of interest that these interactions also appear to be mediated by sequences in the unique amino-terminal ends of the PDE4 proteins. The PDE4A4/5 isoform has been demonstrated to bind to proteins containing SH3 domains (38O'Connell J.C. McCallum J.F. McPhee I. Wakefield J. Houslay E.S. Wishart W. Bolger G. Frame M. Houslay M.D. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 255-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The PDE4A1 isoform is targeted to membranes, and the membrane targeting of this isoform is mediated by specific amino acids in its amino-terminal region (27McPhee I. Pooley L. Lobban M. Bolger G.

The microtubule-associated protein Tau plays an important role in the polymerization and stabilization of neuronal microtubules (for review, see Ref. 4Delacourte A. Buee L. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1997; 171: 167-224Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Tau is thus crucial to both maintenance of the neuronal cytoskeleton and axonal transport (4Delacourte A. Buee L. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1997; 171: 167-224Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Abnormal intraneuronal inclusions, termed neurofibrillary tangles, composed of Tau are a feature of the pathology in several neurodegenerative conditions (5Dickson D. Ann.

The age of onset is highly variable but is usually 45–65 years. At autopsy, patients with FTDP-17 display pronounced fronto-temporal atrophy with neuronal cell loss, gray and white matter gliosis, and superficial cortical spongiform changes. In addition, virtually all FTDP-17 cases have abnormal intraneuronal Tau inclusions, with glial Tau inclusions present in some families (6Foster N.L. Wilhelmsen K. Sima A.A. Jones M.Z. D'Amato C.J.

In contrast, the splice site mutations in FTDP-17 affect alternative splicing of exon 10 such that an increased proportion of Tau exon 10+ transcripts are generated; this leads to an increase in Tau isoforms with four, as opposed to three, binding repeats (2Hutton M.

The mechanism by which this increase leads to neurodegeneration and FTDP-17 is presently unclear; however, it demonstrates that the ratio of four repeat to three repeat isoforms is crucial to the correct functioning of Tau (2Hutton M. Lendon C.L. Rizzu P. Baker M. Froelich S. Houlden H. Pickering-Brown S. Chakraverty S. Isaacs A. Grover A. Hackett J. Adamson J. Lincoln S. Dickson D. Davies P. Petersen R.C. Stevens M. de Graaff E.

This is consistent with the observation that alternative splicing of exon 10 is developmentally regulated with three repeat Tau alone, in the absence of four repeat Tau, present in fetal brain tissue in multiple species (11Goedert M. Spillantini M.G. Potier M.C. Ulrich J. Crowther R.A. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 393-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (832) Google Scholar, 18Kosik K.S. Orecchio L.D. Bakalis S. Neve R.L. Neuron. 1989; 2: 1389-1397Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar). The predominance of three repeat Tau during neuronal development has clear significance for the likely function of these isoforms in adult brain perhaps implying that human neurons require three repeat Tau to maintain plasticity (4Delacourte A. Buee L. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1997; 171: 167-224Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, the ratio of four to three repeat Tau isoforms varies markedly in different species with a slight predominance of three repeat Tau present in adult human brain (11Goedert M. Spillantini M.G. Potier M.C. Ulrich J. Crowther R.A. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 393-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (832) Google Scholar), while in adult mouse neurons only four repeat Tau is observed (18Kosik K.S. Orecchio L.D. Bakalis S. Neve R.L. Neuron. 1989; 2: 1389-1397Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar). The ratio of Tau isoforms also varies in different neuronal populations with the granule cells of the human dentate gyrus being reported to contain only three repeat Tau isoforms (11Goedert M. Spillantini M.G. Potier M.C. Ulrich J. Crowther R.A. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 393-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (832) Google Scholar).We previously employed RT-PCR analysis of FTDP-17 brains to demonstrate that the 5′ splice site mutations are associated in vivowith a 2–6-fold increase in the ratio of exon 10+ to exon 10−tau mRNA (2Hutton M.

However while both RT-PCR analysis of FTDP-17 brains and splicing assays demonstrated that the 5′ splice site mutations act by increasing the incorporation of exon 10 into tau mRNAs, neither method indicated the mechanism by which the mutations affected splicing (2Hutton M.

Examination of the intronic sequence downstream of exon 10 revealed that each of the mutations was predicted to disrupt a potential stem-loop structure that was likely involved in the regulation of exon 10 alternative splicing by competing with the U1 snRNP for binding to the 5′ splice site (2Hutton M.

Genet. 1994; 6: 98-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar) to test the hypothesis that the stability of the potential stem-loop structure in the 5′ splice site oftau exon 10 at least partially determines the ratio oftau exon 10+/− transcripts and that the splice site mutations act by disrupting this structure. We also examined the sequence of the exon 10 5′ splice site in the tau gene from bovine, rabbit, rat, mouse, and two other primates to determine if this pre-mRNA structure might regulate alternative splicing in other mammals. Finally, we utilize RNA secondary structure analysis to demonstrate that a stem-loop is present in the normal 5′ splice site oftau exon 10 and that this structure is disrupted by the FTDP-17 splice site mutations. The microtubule-associated protein Tau plays an important role in the polymerization and stabilization of neuronal microtubules (for review, see Ref. 4Delacourte A. Buee L. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1997; 171: 167-224Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Tau is thus crucial to both maintenance of the neuronal cytoskeleton and axonal transport (4Delacourte A. Buee L. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1997; 171: 167-224Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Abnormal intraneuronal inclusions, termed neurofibrillary tangles, composed of Tau are a feature of the pathology in several neurodegenerative conditions (5Dickson D. Ann.

Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 10626-10633Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar) of which 11 encode the six major Tau protein isoforms in human brain. The six different Tau isoforms are generated by alternative splicing of exons 2, 3, and 10 (9Goedert M. Spillantini M.G. Jakes R. Rutherford D. Crowther R.A. Neuron. 1989; 3: 519-526Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1816) Google Scholar). Exons 9–12 encode four microtubule-binding domains that are imperfect repeats of 31 or 32 residues (10Lee G. Neve R.L. Kosik K.S. Neuron. 1989; 2: 1615-1624Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). Alternative splicing of exon 10 gives rise to Tau isoforms with 3 (exon 10−) or 4 (exon 10+) microtubule binding domains (11Goedert M. Spillantini M.G. Potier M.C. Ulrich J. Crowther R.A.

The age of onset is highly variable but is usually 45–65 years. At autopsy, patients with FTDP-17 display pronounced fronto-temporal atrophy with neuronal cell loss, gray and white matter gliosis, and superficial cortical spongiform changes. In addition, virtually all FTDP-17 cases have abnormal intraneuronal Tau inclusions, with glial Tau inclusions present in some families (6Foster N.L. Wilhelmsen K. Sima A.A. Jones M.Z. D'Amato C.J.

In contrast, the splice site mutations in FTDP-17 affect alternative splicing of exon 10 such that an increased proportion of Tau exon 10+ transcripts are generated; this leads to an increase in Tau isoforms with four, as opposed to three, binding repeats (2Hutton M.

The mechanism by which this increase leads to neurodegeneration and FTDP-17 is presently unclear; however, it demonstrates that the ratio of four repeat to three repeat isoforms is crucial to the correct functioning of Tau (2Hutton M. Lendon C.L. Rizzu P. Baker M. Froelich S. Houlden H. Pickering-Brown S. Chakraverty S. Isaacs A. Grover A. Hackett J. Adamson J. Lincoln S. Dickson D. Davies P. Petersen R.C. Stevens M. de Graaff E.

This is consistent with the observation that alternative splicing of exon 10 is developmentally regulated with three repeat Tau alone, in the absence of four repeat Tau, present in fetal brain tissue in multiple species (11Goedert M. Spillantini M.G. Potier M.C. Ulrich J. Crowther R.A. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 393-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (832) Google Scholar, 18Kosik K.S. Orecchio L.D. Bakalis S. Neve R.L. Neuron. 1989; 2: 1389-1397Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar). The predominance of three repeat Tau during neuronal development has clear significance for the likely function of these isoforms in adult brain perhaps implying that human neurons require three repeat Tau to maintain plasticity (4Delacourte A. Buee L. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1997; 171: 167-224Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, the ratio of four to three repeat Tau isoforms varies markedly in different species with a slight predominance of three repeat Tau present in adult human brain (11Goedert M. Spillantini M.G. Potier M.C. Ulrich J. Crowther R.A. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 393-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (832) Google Scholar), while in adult mouse neurons only four repeat Tau is observed (18Kosik K.S. Orecchio L.D. Bakalis S. Neve R.L. Neuron. 1989; 2: 1389-1397Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar). The ratio of Tau isoforms also varies in different neuronal populations with the granule cells of the human dentate gyrus being reported to contain only three repeat Tau isoforms (11Goedert M. Spillantini M.G. Potier M.C. Ulrich J. Crowther R.A. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 393-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (832) Google Scholar). We previously employed RT-PCR analysis of FTDP-17 brains to demonstrate that the 5′ splice site mutations are associated in vivowith a 2–6-fold increase in the ratio of exon 10+ to exon 10−tau mRNA (2Hutton M.

Examination of the intronic sequence downstream of exon 10 revealed that each of the mutations was predicted to disrupt a potential stem-loop structure that was likely involved in the regulation of exon 10 alternative splicing by competing with the U1 snRNP for binding to the 5′ splice site (2Hutton M.

We also examined the sequence of the exon 10 5′ splice site in the tau gene from bovine, rabbit, rat, mouse, and two other primates to determine if this pre-mRNA structure might regulate alternative splicing in other mammals.

Corin has a predicted structure of a type II transmembrane protein and contains two frizzled-like cysteine-rich motifs, seven low density lipoprotein receptor repeats, a macrophage scavenger receptor-like domain, and a trypsin-like protease domain in the extracellular region. Northern analysis showed that corin mRNA was highly expressed in the human heart. In mice, corin mRNA was detected by in situ hybridization in the cardiac myocytes of the embryonic heart as early as embryonic day (E) 9.5. By E11.5–13.5, corin mRNA was most abundant in the primary atrial septum and the trabecular ventricular compartment. Expression in the heart was maintained through the adult. In addition, mouse corin mRNA was also detected in the prehypertrophic chrondrocytes in developing bones. By fluorescentin situ hybridization analysis, the human corin gene was mapped to 4p12–13 where a congenital heart disease locus, total anomalous pulmonary venous return, had been previously localized. The unique domain structure and specific embryonic expression pattern suggest that corin may have a function in cell differentiation during development. The chromosomal localization of the human corin gene makes it an attractive candidate gene for total anomalous pulmonary venous return.

Serine proteases are essential for a variety of biological processes including food digestion, complement activation, and blood coagulation (1Neurath H. Science. 1984; 224: 350-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar, 2Huber R. Bode W. Acc. Chem. Res. 1978; 11: 114-122Crossref Scopus (610) Google Scholar, 3Davie E.W. Fujikawa K. Kisiel W. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 10363-10370Crossref PubMed Scopus (1627) Google Scholar). In Drosophila, serine proteases are also involved in developmental pathways. For example, serine proteases encoded by the nudel, gastrulation defective, easter, and snake genes are key components of a proteolytic cascade that is critical for the establishment of the dorsal-ventral pattern in developing embryos (4Morisato D. Anderson K.V. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1995; 29: 371-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar, 5LeMosy E.K. Kemler D. Hashimoto C. Development. 1998; 125: 4045-4053PubMed Google Scholar, 6Konrad K.D. Goralski T.J. Mahowald A.P. Marsh J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6819-6824Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Genetic defects in these genes often lead to the disruption of the dorsal-ventral axis, resulting in embryonic lethality (7Anderson K.V. Schneider D.S. Morisato D. Jin Y. Ferguson E.L. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1992; 57: 409-417Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Most serine proteases of the trypsin family are secreted proteins. Several members from this family have been identified that contain an integral transmembrane domain. Hepsin, for example, is a serine protease expressed on the surface of hepatocytes. Structurally, hepsin is a type II transmembrane protein with the transmembrane domain at its amino terminus and the protease domain at the carboxyl terminus exposed to the outside of the cell (8Tsuji A. Torres-Rosado A. Arai T. Le Beau M.M. Lemons R.S. Chou S.H. Kurachi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16948-16953Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In tissue culture studies, hepsin was shown to contribute to hepatocyte growth (9Torres-Rosado A. O'Shea K.S. Tsuji A. Chou S.H. Kurachi K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7181-7185Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). However, the physiological significance of the growth stimulating activity of hepsin remains unknown (10Wu Q. Yu D. Post J. Halks-Miller M. Sadler J.E. Morser J. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 321-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In Drosophila, Stubble-stubbloid protein, another transmembrane serine protease, shares structural similarities with hepsin (11Appel L.F. Prout M. Abu-Shumays R. Hammonds A. Garbe J.C. Fristrom D. Fristrom J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4937-4941Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Genetic studies demonstrated that Stubble-stubbloid is essential for epithelial morphogenesis and development of the fruit fly. Defects in theStubble-stubbloid gene cause malformation of legs, wings, and bristles. Most recently, other transmembrane serine proteases were isolated and cloned from human trachea and small intestine (12Yamaoka K. Masuda K. Ogawa H. Takagi K. Umemoto N. Yasuoka S. J. Biol.

In this study, we report the cloning of a cDNA from the human heart that encodes a novel transmembrane serine protease, designated corin.

In situ hybridization revealed that corin mRNA was expressed in the embryonic heart as early as E9.5, and the expression in the heart was maintained through the adult stage. In addition, corin mRNA was detected in prehypertrophic chrondrocytes of the developing bones. The unusual domain structures and specific expression pattern suggested that corin may have a function in cell differentiation during embryonic development. Human cancer cell lines, HEC-1-A (endometrium adenocarcinoma), U2-OS (osteosarcoma), SK-LMS-1 (vulva sarcoma), RL95-2 (endometrium carcinoma), and AN3-CA (endometrium adenocarcinoma) were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). Human heart cDNA libraries and human and mouse multiple tissue Northern blots were purchased from CLONTECH (Palo Alto, CA). Mouse tissue sections used for in situ hybridization were purchased from Novagen (Madison, WI). Tissue culture media and supplements were from Life Technologies Inc. All other chemicals were obtained from Sigma. An expressed sequence tag (EST) clone was found in a human heart cDNA library from the Incyte EST data base that shared significant sequence homology with trypsin, indicating that the EST may encode a novel serine protease gene. A 2.1-kb EcoRI-XhoI insert from this EST clone was used to screen a human heart cDNA library (CLONTECH). Approximately, 5 × 106 lambda phage clones were screened, and two positive clones were isolated that contained inserts of 3.5 and 3.1 kb, respectively. The DNA sequences of these two clones were determined. Oligonucleotide primers were designed to clone further 5′ end cDNA sequences by 5′ rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) using Marathon-ready human heart cDNA templates (CLONTECH). The PCR products from 5′ RACE were cloned into pCRII vector (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA) and sequenced. Oligonucleotide primers used in the 5′ RACE experiments were 5′-CAGTTGGTTTGAACAAGTGCAGGG-3′, 5′-TGCAAGGAGGGATACGCTCGCCTG-3′, 5′-AATCCCAAGAACAGACTCACAGCG-3′, 5′-CGGGTCACAGAGAGAGCTACCACC-3′, 5′-GGTCTCCTTCTTGACATGAATCTG-3′, 5′-CGGAGCCCCATGAAGTTAAACCA-3′, and 5′-AACAAAAGGATCCTTGGAGGTCGGACGAGT-3′. The final 5′ end sequence of human corin cDNA was derived from at least three independent clones. The full-length cDNA sequence was compiled using the Genetics Computer Group (GCG) software (version 9.1, Madison, WI). Northern blots containing poly(A)+ RNA samples (2 μg/lane) from multiple human and mouse tissues were purchased from CLONTECH. Human and mouse corin cDNA probes were labeled with [32P]dCTP using a random primed DNA labeling kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Northern hybridization was performed at 42 °C overnight in a solution containing 40% formamide, 5× Denhardt's solution, 6× SSC, 100 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA, and 0.1% SDS. Blots were washed with 0.2× SSC, 0.1% SDS at 60 °C and then exposed to Fuji imaging plates. As a control, the blots were reprobed with a human actin cDNA probe provided byCLONTECH. mRNA samples were isolated from Hec-1-A, U2-OS, SK-LMS-1, and AN3-CA cells using a commercial RNA preparation kit (Oligotex Direct mRNA Mini Kits, Qiagen). First strand cDNAs were synthesized using SuperScript II RNase− reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies Inc.). Human corin-specific oligonucleotide primers (sense primer, 5′-AACAAAAGGATCCTTGGAGGTCGGACGAGT-3′, and antisense primer, 5′-CGGAGCCCCATGA AGTTAATCCA-3′) were used to amplify a 630-bp fragment of corin cDNA between nucleotides 2475 and 3105. Oligonucleotide primers TFR1 (5′-GTCAATGTCCCAAACGTCACCAGA-3′) and TFR2 (5′-ATTTCGGGAATGCTGAGAAAACAGACAGA-3′), derived from the human glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) gene, were used as an internal quantification control. PCR reactions were performed with a thermal cycler (Perkin-Elmer, model 480). PCR products were separated on 1% agarose gels and visualized by ethidium bromide staining. Mouse adult heart and embryonic tissue sections were deparaffinized in xylene, rehydrated, and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde. The tissues were digested with proteinase K (20 μg/ml), then treated with triethanolamine/acetic anhydride, and dehydrated. An 800-bp mouse corin cDNA fragment from the coding region was cloned into pCRII (Invitrogen) in two orientations to yield plasmids pM11 and pM41. The plasmids were linearized byHindIII digestion. Sense and antisense probes were synthesized using T7 RNA polymerase (T7/SP6 transcription kit, Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and labeled with [33P]UTP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The hybridization was carried out as described (14Jen Y. Manova K. Benezra R. Dev. Dyn. 1997; 208: 92-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). The slides were dehydrated and dipped in Kodak NTB-2 emulsion and exposed for 4 weeks in light-tight boxes at 4 °C. Photographic development was carried out in a Kodak D-19 developer. The slides were stained with hematoxylin/eosin and analyzed using both light- and dark-field optics of a Zeiss microscope. P1 phage clones containing the human corin gene were isolated by filter hybridization using a human corin cDNA as the probe. One clone was confirmed by DNA sequencing using a primer from human corin cDNA. The DNA fragment from this P1 phage was labeled with digoxigenin-dUTP. The labeled probe was combined with sheared human DNA and hybridized to metaphase chromosomes derived from PHA-stimulated peripheral blood lymphocytes in a solution containing 50% formamide, 10% dextran sulfate, and 2× SSC. Hybridization signals were detected by fluorescent-labeled antidigoxigenin antibodies and counter-staining with 4,6-diaminoidino-2-phenylindole. A total of 80 metaphase cells were analyzed of which 74 cells exhibited specific labeling. A model of the corin protease domain (amino acids 802–1042) was built based on the structure of bovine chymotrypsinogen A at 1.8-Å resolution (15Wang D. Bode W. Huber R. J. Mol. Biol. 1985; 185: 595-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar,16Ponder J.W. Richards F.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 193: 775-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (1350) Google Scholar), using the homology program (Insight II, 1995, MSI, San Diego, CA). Rotamers were used for non-identical side chain replacements (16Ponder J.W. Richards F.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 193: 775-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (1350) Google Scholar). Coordinates for the loop insertions were extracted from the Brookhaven protein data bank (17Bernstein F.C. Koetzle T.F. Williams G.J. Meyer Jr., E.E. Brice M.D. Rodgers J.R. Kennard O. Shimanouchi T. Tasumi M. J. Mol. Biol. 1977; 112: 535-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (8178) Google Scholar). The model was refined by energy minimization using the AMBER force field (Discover 95.0), with a distance-dependent dielectric constant. The minimization used the steepest descents and conjugate gradient methods as follows: first for the loops only where insertions and deletions occurred, then side chains, and a final round of minimization keeping the Cα atoms fixed. The residues of corin (His843, Asp892, and Ser985) corresponding to the catalytic triad of the template structure were also held fixed. A computer search using the BLAST program identified an EST clone from a human heart library that shared significant homology with serine protease family members, such as trypsin. The EST clone was used to isolate the full-length cDNA of a novel gene, designated corin for its abundant expression in the heart. The sequence of the full-length corin cDNA, 4933 bp in length, is shown in Fig. 1. The size of the cDNA is consistent with the length of corin mRNA (∼5 kb) detected by Northern analysis (Fig. 4A). An ATG codon is located at position 95 that may represent the translation initiation site. The open reading frame (ORF) spans 3126 bp with a 5′-untranslated region of 94 nucleotides before the initiation codon. At the 3′ end, there is a 1.7-kb 3′-untranslated region after the stop codon at position 3221. A polyadenylylation signal of AATAAA is present 12 nucleotides before the poly(A)+ tail.Figure 4Northern analysis of corin mRNA expression. Human and mouse multiple tissue Northern blots were hybridized with human and mouse corin cDNA probes, respectively. In human tissues (A and B), corin mRNA was detected only in samples from heart. In mouse tissues (C), abundant expression of corin mRNA was detected in samples from heart. Weak signals were also detected in samples from testis and kidney.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The ORF of the human corin cDNA encodes a polypeptide of 1042 amino acids with a calculated mass of 116 kDa. At the amino terminus of the predicted corin protein, there is no discernible signal peptide sequence. Hydropathy plots using the GCG program identified a highly hydrophobic region between amino acids 46 and 66 (Fig. 2B). This hydrophobic sequence could serve as a potential transmembrane domain. There are positively charged amino acid residues immediately preceding the putative transmembrane segment, suggesting that corin is a type II transmembrane protein with the amino terminus present in the cytosol (18Hartmann E. Rapoport T.A. Lodish H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 5786-5790Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar). Consistent with this hypothesis, there are 19 predicted N-linked glycosylation sites present in the extracellular domains of corin (Fig. 1). Analysis of the corin protein sequence showed that in the extracellular region there are two frizzled-like cysteine-rich domains, seven LDL receptor repeats, one macrophage scavenger receptor-like domain, and one trypsin-like serine protease domain (Fig. 2A). As shown in Fig. 2A, two frizzled-like cysteine-rich domains are located at amino acids 134–259 and 450–573, respectively. Amino acid sequences of these two domains share significant similarities with the extracellular cysteine-rich domain of the DrosophilaFrizzled protein, a seven-transmembrane receptor essential for polarity determination during the development of the fruit fly (19Vinson C.R. Conover S. Adler P.N. Nature. 1989; 338: 263-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). The frizzled-like cysteine-rich domains have also been found in other proteins, such as Dfz2 in Drosophila (20Bhanot P. Brink M. Samos C.H. Hsieh J.C. Wang Y. Macke J.P. Andrew D. Nathans J. Nusse R. Nature. 1996; 382: 225-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (1228) Google Scholar), Lin-17 inCaenorhabditis elegans (21Sawa H. Lobel L. Horvitz H.R. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2189-2197Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), and FZ-1 in human (22Chan S.D. Karpf D.B. Fowlkes M.E. Hooks M. Bradley M.S. Vuong V. Bambino T. Liu M.Y. Arnaud C.D. Strewler G.J. Nissenson R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25202-25207Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The sequences of the two frizzled-like cysteine-rich domains in corin are closest to those in Lin-17 and FZ-1. As shown in Fig. 2C, all the 10 conserved cysteine residues are present in the frizzled-like cysteine-rich domains of corin. Between amino acids 268–415 and 579–690 (Fig. 2, A andD), there are seven cysteine-rich repeats homologous to the LDL receptor class A repeats (23Brown M.S. Herz J. Goldstein J.L. Nature. 1997; 388: 629-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Each repeat is about 36 amino acids long and contains six cysteine residues as well as a highly conserved cluster of negatively charged amino acids. In the LDL receptor, these cysteine-rich repeats bind calcium ions and play an essential role in endocytosis of the extracellular ligands (23Brown M.S. Herz J. Goldstein J.L. Nature. 1997; 388: 629-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Similar motifs have been found in the extracellular domain of other membrane receptors, such as LDL receptor-related protein (LRP1) (24Krieger M. Herz J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 601-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (1061) Google Scholar), megalin (also known as LRP2 or gp330) (25Kounnas M.Z. Chappell D.A. Strickland D.K. Argraves W.S. J. Biol.

J. 1987; 242: 849-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), enterokinase (27Kitamoto Y. Yuan X. Wu Q. McCourt D.W. Sadler J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7588-7592Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), andDrosophila proteins yolkless and nudel (28Schonbaum C.P. Lee S. Mahowald A.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In addition to the frizzled-like cysteine-rich domains and LDL receptor-like repeats, there is another cysteine-rich region between amino acids 713 and 801 in corin (Fig. 2, A andE). This region contains 88 amino acids and is homologous to the cysteine-rich motif found in the macrophage scavenger receptor (30Matsumoto A. Naito M. Itakura H. Ikemoto S. Asaoka H. Hayakawa I. Kanamori H. Aburatani H. Takaku F. Suzuki H. Kobari Y. Miyai T. Takahashi K. Cohen E.H. Wydro R. Housman D.E. Kodama T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1989; 264: 6545-6549Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Dangott L.J. Jordan J.E. Bellet R.A. Garbers D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A. 1994; 91: 7588-7592Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). At the carboxyl terminus of corin protein between amino acid residues 802 and 1042, there is a trypsin-like serine protease domain (Fig. 2A). This protease domain is highly homologous to the catalytic domain of members of the trypsin superfamily. For example, amino acid sequence identities between corin and prekallikrein (33Chung D.W. Fujikawa K. McMullen B.A. Davie E.W. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 2410-2417Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar), factor XI (34Fujikawa K. Chung D.W. Hendrickson L.E. Davie E.W. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 2417-2424Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar), and hepsin (35Leytus S.P. Loeb K.R. Hagen F.S. Kurachi K. Davie E.W. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 1067-1074Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) are 40, 40, and 38%, respectively. All essential features of serine protease sequences are well conserved in corin (Figs. 1 and 2F). The active site residues of the catalytic triad are located at His843, Asp892, and Ser985. The amino acid residues forming the substrate specificity pocket are located at Asp979, Gly1007, and Gly1018. These residues are predicted to bind the substrate P1 residues, suggesting that corin would cleave its substrate after basic residues, such as lysine or arginine. In addition, a putative activation cleavage site was found at Arg801, suggesting that corin would be synthesized as an inactive zymogen and that another trypsin-like enzyme was required for its activation. In the protease domain, there are 12 cysteine residues. Potential pairing of these cysteine residues can be predicted by comparing with other well studied serine proteases, such as trypsin and chymotrypsin. First three pairs of cysteine residues present in essentially all members of the trypsin superfamily are located at Cys828–Cys844, Cys955–Cys970, and Cys981–Cys1010. Two more pairs of cysteine residues are present at the positions Cys790–Cys912 and Cys926–Cys991. These two pairs of cysteine residues are commonly found in a subfamily of two-chain serine proteases, such as chymotrypsin and prekallikrein (33Chung D.W. Fujikawa K. McMullen B.A. Davie E.W. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 2410-2417Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). The presence of Cys790 and Cys912 indicated that, after the activation cleavage at Arg801, the catalytic domain of corin would remain attached to the rest of molecule by a disulfide bond. Interestingly, there is one additional pair of cysteine residues, Cys817 and Cys830, present in corin. Cysteine residues at these two positions were not found in any other serine proteases in vertebrates. A search of data bases showed that a chymotrypsinogen-like serine protease from the lugworm, Arenicola marina, had two cysteine residues at the corresponding positions. 2J. Eberhardt, GenBankTM accession number G1160388. A model of the corin protease domain was built based on the structure of bovine chymotrypsinogen A (Fig. 3). Based on this corin model, where the C-α atoms of these two cysteine residues were held fixed during energy minimization, the distance between the sulfur atoms of their side chains is about 2.5 Å after rotamer searching. The model indicates that these two cysteines are likely to form a disulfide bond connecting two β-sheets in the core of the protease domain (Fig. 3). To determine expression of the corin gene in human tissues, Northern hybridization was performed using human corin cDNA probes. As shown in Fig. 4A, an ∼5-kb transcript was detected only in the heart but not in other tissues including brain, placenta, lung, liver, skeletal muscle, kidney, pancreas, spleen, thymus, prostate, testis, ovary, colon, and leukocytes. Since the heart is mainly composed of cardiac muscles, Northern analysis was performed to examine the presence of corin mRNA in other human muscle-rich tissues. Again, corin mRNA was detected in the heart but not in uterus, small intestine, bladder, stomach, and prostate (Fig. 4B). To examine corin mRNA expression in mice, the full-length mouse corin cDNA was cloned by a PCR-based strategy. Mouse corin cDNA shared 89% sequence identities with human corin cDNA (data not shown). Northern analysis was performed with RNA samples from mouse tissues. As shown in Fig. 4C, a prominent transcript of ∼5 kb was detected in samples derived from the heart. In contrast to Northern analysis with human samples, low levels of corin mRNA were also detected in samples derived from the testes and kidneys. In situ hybridization was performed to determine the temporal and special expression of corin mRNA. In adult mice (Fig. 5), corin mRNA was detected in cardiac myocytes of both atrium and ventricle. The level of expression appeared to be higher in the atrium than the ventricle. During embryonic development, corin mRNA was first detected at E9.5 in both atrium and ventricle of the developing heart (Fig. 6B). Between E11.5 and E13.5, corin mRNA was highly expressed in the thickened atrial wall and in the regions that underwent trabeculation in the ventricle (Fig. 6,D and F). By E15.5, corin mRNA in the heart was more abundant, especially in primary atrial septa (Fig. 6H). Weak signals appeared to be present in developing aorta and vena cava but not in the esophagus and lungs (Fig. 6H). The expression of corin mRNA in the heart was maintained in the subsequent embryonic stages (not shown).Figure 6Expression of corin mRNA in the developing heart. Tissue sections were prepared from mouse embryos at day E9.5 (A and B), E11.5 (C andD), E12.5 (E and F), and E15.5 (G–J) and stained with hematoxylin/eosin (A, C, E , G, and I). Corin mRNA expression was detected by in situ hybridization in developing heart by E9.5 (B) and E11.5 (D) as indicated byarrows. The expression was prominent in the primary atrial septum and the trabecular ventricular compartment by E12.5 (F). By E15.5, corin mRNA was detected in most cardiac myocytes in both atrium (H) and ventricle (J). Abbreviations used in E , G, and I are as follows:Atr, atrium; V, ventricle; Ar, aorta;Vc, vena cava; E, esophagus; Lu, lung.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In addition to the heart, corin mRNA was also detected in other mouse tissues byin situ hybridization. For example, corin mRNA was present in the uterus of pregnant mice and in the developing kidneys. In the uterus (Fig. 7L), corin mRNA expression was most abundant in the decidual cells close to the implantation site of the embryo. In the developing kidneys at E15.5, corin mRNA was highly expressed in the stromal cells in the medulla but not in the cortex of the kidney (Fig. 7J). This finding was consistent with the results of Northern analysis in which a corin transcript was found in RNA samples from mouse kidneys (Fig. 3C). Interestingly, in situ hybridization also identified corin mRNA in several cartilage-derived structures, such as the vertebra in the tail, the turbinate in the head, and the long bones in the limbs (Fig. 7, B, D, F, and H). Fig. 7Bshowed the expression of corin mRNA in cartilage primordia of vertebral bodies in the posterior of an E13.5 embryo. By E15.5, the level of corin mRNA expression in the vertebra was much lower as the vertebra became more matured (data not shown), indicating that corin may play a role in the differentiation of chondrocytes. This notion was supported by the expression of corin mRNA in developing limbs. Fig. 7, E and F, showed an early developing digital bone that consisted of three types of cells as follows: hypertrophic chondrocytes at the center, prehypertrophic chondrocytes next to the hypertrophic zone, and proliferating chondrocytes at the both ends. Corin mRNA was found mostly in the prehypertrophic chondrocytes (Fig. 7F). Hybridization signals were also present in perichondrium (Fig. 7F). Fig. 7, G and H, showed a long bone in a hind limb that was at a more advanced developmental stage. The central hypertrophic zone was replaced by vascularized tissues containing bone marrow cells and osteroblasts. Nevertheless, similar expression pattern of corin mRNA was found in the narrow zone of the prehypertrophic chondrocytes and in the perichondrium. These results indicated that corin expression was associated with a specific stage of chondrocyte differentiation. A number of human cancer cell lines were screened by Northern and RT-PCR analyses for the presence of corin mRNA. In most cell lines, such as HL60, HeLa, K562, MOLT-4, RAJI, SW480, A549, and G36, corin mRNA was undetectable (data not shown). However, corin mRNA was found in several cell lines derived from uterus tumors or osteosarcoma. As shown in Fig. 8, corin mRNA was detected by RT-PCR in endometrium carcinoma cell lines HEC-1-A, AN3 CA, and RL95-2, leiomyosarcoma cell line SK-LMS-1, as well as in osteosarcoma cell line U2-OS.

Previously, we found that oxygen deprivation induced tissue factor, especially in mononuclear phagocytes, by an early growth response (Egr-1)-dependent pathway without involvement of HIF-1 (Yan, S.-F., Zou, Y.-S., Gao, Y., Zhai, C., Mackman, N., Lee, S., Milbrandt, J., Pinsky, D., Kisiel, W., and Stern, D. (1998) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 95, 8298–8303). Now, we show that cultured monocytes subjected to hypoxia (pO2 ≈ 12 torr) displayed increasedEgr-1 expression because of de novobiosynthesis, with a ≈10-fold increased rate of transcription. Transfection of monocytes with Egr-1 promoter-luciferase constructs localized elements responsible for hypoxia-enhanced expression to −424/−65, a region including EBS (ets binding site)-SRE (serum response element)-EBS and SRE-EBS-SRE sites. Further studies with each of these regions ligated to the basal thymidine kinase promoter and luciferase demonstrated that EBS sites in the element spanning −424/−375 were critical for hypoxia-enhanceable gene expression. These data suggested that an activated ets factor, such as Elk-1, in complex with serum response factor, was the likely proximal trigger of Egr-1 transcription. Indeed, hypoxia induced activation of Elk-1, and suppression of Elk-1 blocked up-regulation ofEgr-1 transcription. The signaling cascade preceding Elk-1 activation in response to oxygen deprivation was traced to activation of protein kinase C-βII, Raf, mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase kinase and mitogen-activated protein kinases. Comparable hypoxia-mediatedEgr-1 induction and activation were observed in cultured hepatoma-derived cells deficient in HIF-1β and wild-type hepatoma cells, indicating that the HIF-1 and Egr-1 pathways are initiated independently in response to oxygen deprivation. We propose that activation of Egr-1 in response to hypoxia induces a different facet of the adaptive response than HIF-1, one component of which causes expression of tissue factor, resulting in fibrin deposition.

The cellular response to oxygen deprivation involves a series of metabolic and biosynthetic events associated with adaptation to a hypoxic environment. Enhanced expression of the noninsulin-dependent glucose transporter GLUT1, key glycolytic enzymes, erythropoietin, and vascular endothelial growth factor are well described examples of the host response to hypoxia with obvious advantages for survival in an oxygen-deficient environment (1Semenza G.

Baeuerle P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 234: 632-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). These considerations underscore the complexity of the cellular response to environmental challenge by hypoxic and/or oxidative stress. Venous thrombosis is associated with local hypoxemia and stasis, and has a considerable morbidity and mortality. Although cessation of blood flow perturbs a spectrum of metabolic and hemodynamic factors, we have found that normobaric hypoxia causes de novo expression of tissue factor, especially in mononuclear phagocytes (MPs), resulting in fibrin deposition in pulmonary vasculature (17Lawson C. Yan S.-D. Yan S.-F. Liao H. Zhou Y.-S. Sobel J. Kisiel W. Stern D. Pinsky D. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 1729-1738Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 18Pinsky D. Liao H. Lawson C. Yan S.-F. Chen J. Carmeliet P. Loskutoff D. Stern D. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 102: 919-928Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we have observed recently that hypoxia-mediated expression of tissue factor is caused by the early growth response gene product Egr-1, based on the parallel absence of enhanced tissue factor expression and fibrin deposition in the pulmonary vasculature of homozygous Egr-1null mice (19Yan S.-F. Zou Y.-S. Gao Y. Zhai C. Mackman N. Lee S. Milbrandt J. Pinsky D. Kisiel W. Stern D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8298-8303Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). These observations suggested the possible contribution of Egr-1 to the cell biology of hypoxia, potentially engaging a pathway with quite different outcomes for the adaptive host response than HIF-1. In this study, we analyzed up-regulation ofEgr-1 in hypoxic MPs and have found it to occur at the transcriptional level, consequent to activation of protein kinase C-βII (PKCβII), leading to Raf- and MEK-dependent activation of MAP kinases, ERK 1/2, and, ultimately, activation of the ets factor Elk-1. Although the physiologic and pathophysiologic consequences of Egr-1 activation in hypoxia are not yet clear, induction of the trigger of the procoagulant pathway, tissue factor, suggests the basis for pathologic events underlying thrombotic pathology associated with oxygen deprivation by a pathway distinct from HIF-1. A line of rat mononuclear phagocytes (NR8383; alveolar macrophages) was obtained from ATCC (Manassas, VA), and cells were grown in Ham's F-12K medium containing 15% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum. Human blood monocytes were harvested from peripheral blood by density gradient centrifugation and plated for 2 days in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal calf serum (11Karakurum M. Shreeniwas R. Chen J. Pinsky D.J. Yan S.D. Anderson M. Sunouchi K. Major J. Hamilton T. Kuwabara K. Rot A. Nowygrod R. Stern D.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 93: 1564-1570Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). The human monocyte line U937 (ATCC) was also grown in RPMI 1640 with fetal calf serum (10%). Mouse macrophages (ATCC; P388D1) were grown in high glucose RPMI 1640 containing 10% fetal calf serum. Wild-type hepatoma cells (Hepa1c1c7) or hepatoma cells deficient in the ARNT/HIF-1β function (c4) were generously provided by Dr. Oliver Hankinson (UCLA) and were grown in α-minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (20Wood S.M.

Cells were subjected to hypoxia using an environmental chamber as described previously (17Lawson C. Yan S.-D. Yan S.-F. Liao H. Zhou Y.-S. Sobel J. Kisiel W. Stern D. Pinsky D. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 1729-1738Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar); pO2 in the medium was ≈12–14 torr. Cells subjected to hypoxia were placed in medium preequilibrated with the hypoxic gas mixture just prior to placement in the environmental chamber. Thus, cultures were immersed immediately in the oxygen-deprived environment at the time of medium change/placement in the chamber. Experiments employing mice subjected to hypoxia (final oxygen concentration of 5.5–6.5%) employed C57BL6/J mice (12–15 weeks old; Jackson Laboratories, Bar Harbor ME) and utilized a specially built environmental chamber (17Lawson C. Yan S.-D. Yan S.-F. Liao H. Zhou Y.-S. Sobel J. Kisiel W. Stern D. Pinsky D. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 1729-1738Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Following hypoxia, mice were killed, and tissue was processed immediately. For Northern analysis, tissue was cut into small pieces, immersed in Trizol (Life Technologies, Inc.), homogenized, and total RNA was extracted and subjected to electrophoresis (0.8% agarose). RNA was transferred to Duralon-UV membranes (Stratagene), and membranes were then hybridized with 32P-labeled cDNA probe for mouse Egr-1 (21Lemaire P. Vesque C. Schmitt J. Stunnenberg H. Frank R. Charnay P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 3456-3467Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Blots were also hybridized with32P-labeled β-actin as an internal control for RNA loading. The same procedure was employed to assess Sp1 transcripts in hypoxic murine lung, except 32P-labeled cDNA probe for Sp1 was employed (22Khachigian L. Collins T. Circ. Res. 1997; 81: 457-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). For Western blotting, nuclear extracts were prepared (see below) and subjected to SDS-PAGE (7.5%). Proteins in the gel were transferred electrophoretically to nitrocellulose membranes, and immunoblotting was performed with rabbit anti-Egr-1 IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) and anti-Sp1 IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) according to the blotto procedure (23Johnson D. Gautsch J. Sportsman J. Elder J. Gene Anal. Tech. 1984; 1: 3-8Crossref Scopus (1174) Google Scholar). Sites of primary antibody binding were visualized with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Amersham International, Buckinghamshire, U. K.). The final detection of immunoreactive bands was performed using the enhanced chemiluminescent Western blotting system (Amersham). For immunocytochemical studies, lung tissue was harvested, cut into small pieces, washed with phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.0) to remove blood, fixed in formalin, and embedded in paraffin (19Yan S.-F. Zou Y.-S. Gao Y. Zhai C. Mackman N. Lee S. Milbrandt J. Pinsky D. Kisiel W. Stern D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8298-8303Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Sections were first stained with primary antibodies, anti-Egr-1 IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), rat F4/80 monoclonal antibody (Caltag Laboratories, South San Francisco, CA), or rabbit anti-smooth muscle α-actin IgG (Sigma). Then, they were incubated with secondary antibody, an affinity-purified peroxidase-conjugated IgG, either goat anti-rabbit IgG or goat anti-rat IgG (Sigma). The electrophoretic mobility gel shift assay (EMSA) was performed on nuclear extracts prepared immediately from hypoxic lung using the method of Dignam et al. (24Dignam J. Lebovitz R. Roeder R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9153) Google Scholar). Double-stranded oligonucleotide probes for Egr (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were 5′-end labeled with [32P]ATP by using T4 polynucleotide kinase and standard procedures. Binding reactions were performed as described (9Yan S.-F. Tritto I. Pinsky D. Liao H. Huang J. Fuller G. Brett J. May L. Stern D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11463-11471Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar), and samples (5 μg of protein in each lane) were loaded directly onto nondenaturing polyacrylamide/bisacrylamide (6%) gels. Gels were prerun for 20 min before samples were loaded, and electrophoresis was performed at room temperature for 1.5–2 h at 100 volts. For competition studies, a 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled probes for NF-IL-6 (9Yan S.-F. Tritto I. Pinsky D. Liao H. Huang J. Fuller G. Brett J. May L. Stern D. J. Biol.

Med. 1996; 6: 151-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar),Egr (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or AP-1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was added. MPs were subjected to hypoxia for the indicated times, and total RNA was extracted using Trizol and subjected to Northern analysis. The same protocol as for Egr-1 analysis in mouse lung was employed (see above). Where indicated, Northern analysis was also performed to detect tissue factor transcripts. In this case, 32P-labeled tissue factor cDNA was employed to probe membranes with immobilized RNA. Nuclear run-on analysis, to assess the rate of Egr-1transcription, was performed on cultured MPs deprived of serum for 24 h and then subjected to normoxia or hypoxia for 30 min. Nuclei were isolated, and in vitro transcription was performed as described (9Yan S.-F. Tritto I. Pinsky D. Liao H. Huang J. Fuller G. Brett J. May L. Stern D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11463-11471Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). EMSA using the consensus 32P-labeledEgr probe on nuclear extracts from hypoxic cultured MPs employed the same methods as for lung tissue above. Transient transfection, with Superfect Reagent (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA), used a series of deletional/truncated Egr-1 promoter-reporter (luciferase) constructs: A (the designation given in Fig. 4A) includes a 1.2-kilobase fragment of the murineEgr-1 5′-flanking sequence Egr-1(1.2)Luc (25Cohen D. Gullans S. Chin W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12903-12908Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 26Gashler A. Sukhatme V. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1995; 50: 191-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar); B includes sequences from 1 through 386 and from 886 through 1000; C includes sequences from 511 through 1000; D includes sequences from 511 through 686 and 886 through 1000; E includes sequences from 811 through 1000; F includes sequences from 845 through 1000; and G includes sequences from 866 through 1000. The construct labeledV in Fig. 4A denotes the promoterless vector pXP2 (23Johnson D. Gautsch J. Sportsman J. Elder J. Gene Anal. Tech. 1984; 1: 3-8Crossref Scopus (1174) Google Scholar). The constructs pYSF62&65 were comprised of −424/−375 and −111/−65, respectively, from the murine Egr-1 promoter, linked to the basal thymidine kinase promoter (−80/+18) and the pGL3 basic vector (Promega). For pYSF63&64, site-directed mutagenesis was employed to mutate GG to TT located at positions −414/−413 (pYSF63) and −393/−392 (pYSF64), respectively, which flank a CArG box (SRE1) (25Cohen D.

Cotransfection with pCMV-β-galactosidase was used as an internal control for efficiency of transfection. Luciferase activity was normalized based on β-galactosidase activity in the same well; this is termed relative luciferase activity and is used in each of the transfection studies. Prior to experiments, the medium bathing MPs was aspirated, and fresh medium containing 1% fetal calf serum was added for 24 h. Cells were then placed in serum-free medium with protein kinase C inhibitors, calphostin C, GF109203X, or H-7 (all obtained from Sigma) for 60 min. Next, cultures were transferred to the hypoxia chamber, and cells were harvested after 30 min (for detection of Egr-1 mRNA) or 4 h (for detection of tissue factor mRNA). Transfection assays employed promoter-reporter constructs to monitor transcription of Egr-1 (pYSF62, see above) and tissue factor (designated as pTF[−111/+14]Luc; the latter spanned −111/+14 from the tissue factor gene, including the hypoxia-responsiveEgr-1 sites (19Yan S.-F.

Expression constructs for PKC isoforms were as follows: dominant-negative (DN) PKCα (PKCα[K>R]) and DN-PKCε (PKCε[K>R]), as well as constitutively active (CA) PKCα and CA-PKCε constructs (29Soh J.-W.

Konno Y. Fisher A. Bisnauth L. Watson J. Cooper D. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 1273-1281Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The procedure for transfection utilized Superfect Reagent, and the protocol was according to the manufacturer's instructions. For transfection studies, macrophages were transferred to medium with 1% fetal calf serum for 24 h. Then, cotransfection was performed using either Egr-1 promoter-luciferase (1.5 μg; pYSF62) or tissue factor promoter-luciferase (2 μg; pTF[−111/+14]Luc) constructs, one of the PKC-related constructs (1 μg), and pCMV-β-galactosidase (1 μg). Immediately after transfection, cells were maintained in medium with 1% fetal calf serum for 24 h and were then placed in serum-free medium for 20 h. Cultures were next subjected to hypoxia for 4 h (forEgr-1 studies) or 5 h (for tissue factor studies), and luciferase activity was determined using a luminometer. Subcellular association of PKCβII was studied by immunoblotting membranous fractions (33Goldberg M. Zhang H. Steinberg S. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 55-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) from hypoxic U937 cells and lungs from mice subjected to oxygen deprivation. Extracts were subjected to nonreduced SDS-PAGE (7.5%) followed by Western blotting with rabbit anti-PKCβII IgG (as primary antibody) and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (as secondary antibody; Amersham). Similar experiments were performed with extracts of lung. Autophosphorylation of PKC isoforms (PKCβI, PKCβII, and PKCε) was studied by labeling cultures with 32Pi as described (34Conrad R. Keranen L. Ellington A. Newton A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32051-32054Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 35Mitchell F. Marais R. Parker P. Biochem. J. 1989; 261: 131-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) followed by immunoprecipitation with isoform-specific antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), SDS-PAGE, and autoradiography. In brief, cultures were maintained in normoxia, washed with HEPES-buffered phosphate-free high glucose RPMI 1640, and labeled with 100 μCi of32Pi for 3 h at 37 °C under normoxic conditions. Then, cells were subjected to hypoxia for 5, 10, or 15 min and processed as described (34Conrad R. Keranen L. Ellington A. Newton A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32051-32054Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 35Mitchell F. Marais R. Parker P. Biochem. J. 1989; 261: 131-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined, and supernatants with the same amount of protein were immunoprecipitated with antibodies to PKCβI, PKCβII, or PKCε (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Cotransfection of MPs used the same procedure as above. To analyze the role of raf, cells were transfected with a dominant-negative (DN)-Raf (pCGN raf N4; generously provided by Dr. Channing Der, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill) (36Brtva T.

The MEK inhibitor PD98059 (New England Biolabs) was employed at a concentration of 10 μm and was added 1 h before placement of cells in hypoxia. Other constructs included DN-ERK 1 (pCMV-ERK 1[K>R]), DN-ERK 2 (pCMV-ERK 2[K >R]), and DN-Elk-1 (pCMV-Elk-383A) (all generously provided by Dr. Peter Shaw, Queen's Medical Center, Nottingham, UK) (38Kortenjann M. Shaw P. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 2105-2112PubMed Google Scholar). The Elk-1 chimeric reporter system was employed to detect activation of Elk-1 (39Robertson M. Misra-Press A. Laurance M. Stork P. Maurer R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 15: 3531-3539Crossref Google Scholar); the GAL4-Elk-1 expression vector and the 5xGAL4-E1b-luciferase reporter were generously provided by Dr. Richard Maurer (Oregon Health Sciences University, Portland). In-gel kinase assays were used to monitor activation of for ERK 1/2 (40Jiang T. Kuznetsow V. Pak E. Zhang H.-L. Robinson R. Steinberg S. Circ. Res. 1996; 78: 553-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In brief, U937 cells in serum-free medium were exposed to hypoxia for 10 min, and cells were washed three times in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and suspended in ice-cold extraction buffer. Cell extracts were resolved on SDS-PAGE (10%) containing 0.5 mg/ml myelin basic protein (Sigma). Significant differences between experimental groups were detected using analysis of variance for unpaired variables, with post hoc comparisons performed using Tukey's procedure. Data that are shown in graphical format represent the means ± S.E., with a p < 0.05 between groups considered statistically significant. Mice exposed to hypoxia displayed time-dependent induction of Egr-1 mRNA evident by 15 min, with maximal expression by 30 min (Fig. 1A). Western analysis of nuclear extracts from hypoxic lung showed an increase in Egr-1 antigen, with a major immunoreactive band corresponding to a molecular mass of ≈82 kDa (Fig. 1B). In contrast to the observed induction of Egr-1, there was no increase in Sp1 in hypoxic lung, either at the mRNA (Fig. 1A) or antigen level (Fig. 1C; two closely spaced bands corresponding to molecular masses of ≈95 and ≈105 kDa of similar intensity in normoxic and hypoxic lung were observed) (28Cui M.-Z. Parry G. Oeth P. Larson H. Smith M. Huang R.-P. Adamson E. Mackman N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2731-2739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Immunohistochemistry revealed thatEgr-1 expression was not confined to a single cell type but that elevated amounts of Egr-1 antigen were present in a range of cells in hypoxic lung (Fig. 1D) compared with normoxic controls (Fig. 1E). Analysis of adjacent sections using markers for mononuclear phagocytes/macrophages (F4/80) (Fig. 1G) and smooth muscle (smooth muscle α-actin IgG) (Fig. 1I) demonstrated colocalization with increased Egr-1 (Fig. 1, Fand H). Closely paralleling enhanced levels of Egr-1, a time-dependent appearance of Egr DNA binding activity was observed in nuclear extracts from hypoxic lung (Fig. 2 , lanes 2–6). Specificity of the DNA binding activity was shown by disappearance of the gel shift band with excess unlabeled Egr probe (Fig. 2, compare lanes 7 and 8), whereas oligonucleotides corresponding to sequences for AP-1, HIF-1, NF-IL-6, and Sp1 were without effect (Fig. 2, lanes 9–12). Furthermore, in a previous study (19Yan S.-F. Zou Y.-S. Gao Y. Zhai C. Mackman N. Lee S. Milbrandt J. Pinsky D. Kisiel W. Stern D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8298-8303Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), we have found that the protein responsible forEgr DNA binding activity in hypoxic lung was Egr-1, as shown by complete disappearance of the band in the presence of anti-Egr-1 IgG but not nonimmune IgG. These data indicate that Egr-1expression and activation of Egr-1 DNA binding activity occur in the lung within minutes of oxygen deprivation.Figure 2Hypoxia enhances Egr DNA binding activity in nuclear extracts prepared from murine lung.Mice were subjected to hypoxia for the indicated times (lanes 3–6), nuclear extracts were prepared, and EMSA was p"

We amplified hSK4 cDNA from human T lymphoblasts, and we showed that its biophysical and pharmacological properties when stably expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells were essentially identical to the native IK current. In activated lymphoblasts, hSK4 mRNA increased 14.6-fold (Kv1.3 mRNA increased 1.3-fold), with functional consequences. Proliferation was inhibited when Kv1.3 and IK were blocked in naive T cells, but IK block alone inhibited re-stimulated lymphoblasts. IK and Kv1.3 were involved in volume regulation, but IK was more important, particularly in lymphoblasts. hSK4 lacks known Ca2+-binding sites; however, we mapped a Ca2+-dependent calmodulin (CaM)-binding site to the proximal C terminus (Ct1) of hSK4. Full-length hSK4 produced a highly negative membrane potential (V m) in Chinese hamster ovary cells, whereas the channels did not function when either Ct1 or the distal C terminus was deleted (V m ∼0 mV). Native IK (but not expressed hSK4) current was inhibited by CaM and CaM kinase antagonists at physiological V m values, suggesting modulation by an accessory molecule in native cells. Our results provide evidence for increased roles for IK/hSK4 in activated T cell functions; thus hSK4 may be a promising therapeutic target for disorders involving the secondary immune response.

Inasmuch as these functions involve Ca2+ influx through channels activated by depletion of Ca2+ stores, one widely proposed role for K+channels is to maintain a negative membrane potential and large driving force for Ca2+ entry. However, the relative roles of KCa versus Kv1.3 channels in these cell functions are not known, partly owing to the previous lack of potent KCa blockers that do not also block Kv1.3 channels. Two KCa channels have been found in lymphocytes and lymphocytic cell lines. They differ in biophysical and pharmacological properties (2Mahaut-Smith M. Schlichter L.C. J. Physiol.

Physiol. 1992; 99: 63-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) and is also present in rat T and human B lymphocytes (2Mahaut-Smith M. Schlichter L.C. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1989; 415: 69-83Crossref Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 6Schlichter L.C. Pahapill P. Schumacher P.A. Receptors Channels. 1993; 1: 201-215PubMed Google Scholar). However, a corresponding apamin-sensitive whole-cell current has not been identified in normal human T cells, perhaps a result of channel rundown we observed after cell disruption (2Mahaut-Smith M. Schlichter L.C. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1989; 415: 69-83Crossref Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Instead, a KCa channel we first described (2Mahaut-Smith M. Schlichter L.C. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1989; 415: 69-83Crossref Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 3Mahaut-Smith M. Schlichter L.C. Pfluegers Arch. 1989; 414: S164-S165Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) is the prevalent KCa channel in resting and activated human T lymphocytes. It is a charybdotoxin-sensitive, inwardly rectifying channel (15–35 pS in symmetrical K+ solutions (5Grissmer S. Nguyen A.N. Cahalan M.D. J. Gen. Physiol. 1993; 102: 601-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 6Schlichter L.C. Pahapill P. Schumacher P.A. Receptors Channels. 1993; 1: 201-215PubMed Google Scholar)) that is commonly called “IK,” for intermediate conductance KCa. Recently, a molecular candidate for IK was cloned from a human placental cDNA library (hSK4 (7Joiner W.J. Wang L.-Y. Tang M.D. Kaczmarek L.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11013-11018Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar)) and subsequently from human pancreas (hIK1 (8Ishii T.M. Silvia C. Hirschberg B. Bond C.T. Adelman J.P. Maylie J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11651-11656Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar)) and a human lymph node library (hKCa4 (9Logsdon N.J. Kang J. Togo J.A. Christian E.P. Aiyar J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32723-32726Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar)). IK current increases in the 3–4 days following activation of human T cells (5Grissmer S. Nguyen A.N. Cahalan M.D. J. Gen. Physiol. 1993; 102: 601-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Thus, it is anticipated that this KCa current will be especially important for secondary immune responses of activated T cells (lymphoblasts), including proliferation and volume regulation. The regulatory volume decrease (RVD) that follows T cell swelling is known to depend on K+ (and Cl−) channels (10Grinstein S. Foskett J.K. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1990; 52: 399-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 11Sarkadi B. Parker J.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1071: 407-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 12Lang F. Busch G.L. Volkl H. Cell. Physiol. Biochem. 1998; 8: 1-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). Although Kv1.3 is involved in RVD in some resting T cells (13Deutsch C. Chen L.-Q. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10036-10040Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), the relative contribution of IK versus Kv1.3 channels is not known, either in resting human T cells or in lymphoblasts. We previously reported that intracellular Ca2+ rises immediately after human T cells are exposed to a hypotonic shock (14Schlichter L.C. Sakellaropoulos G. Exp. Cell Res. 1994; 215: 211-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar); thus, we predicted that KCa currents would also subserve RVD. In the present study we cloned hSK4 from human T lymphoblasts, expressed the channels stably in CHO cells, and compared the salient biophysical and pharmacological properties of the native and cloned channels. All intrinsic properties examined were indistinguishable, supporting the view that hSK4 homotetramer forms the α subunit of the IK channel of lymphoblasts. We found that hSK4 mRNA expression is strongly up-regulated after T cell activation; thus we predicted (and observed) an increased role for IK current in lymphoblasts compared with resting T cells. Although hSK4 is functionally a KCachannel, that is activated by a rise in intracellular Ca2+, it was recently reported that brain SK channels are not gated directly by Ca2+ but rather by Ca2+ interacting with calmodulin that is irreversibly bound to the channel (15Xia X.-M. Fakler B. Rivard A. Wayman G. Johnson-Pais T. Keen J.E. Ishii T. Hirschberg B. Bond C.T. Lutsenko S. Maylie J. Adelman J.P. Nature. 1998; 395: 503-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar). We have presented preliminary data showing that the lymphoblast IK current is inhibited by antagonists of calmodulin and CaM kinase (16Chang M.C. Schlichter L.C. Soc. Neurosci. Abstr. 1996; 22: 1444Google Scholar, 17Khanna R. Chang M.C. Joiner W. Kaczmarek L.K. Schlichter L.C. Biophys. J. 1998; 74: 35Google Scholar). We now show details of this inhibition of native IK current and that calmodulin binds directly to the hSK4 channel protein in a Ca2+-dependent manner. The CaM binding domain resides in the proximal part of the C terminus, since binding to this region occurs in the absence of flanking sequence and is eliminated in constructs lacking this region. Unlike the study of heterologously expressed brain SK channels (15Xia X.-M. Fakler B. Rivard A. Wayman G. Johnson-Pais T. Keen J.E. Ishii T. Hirschberg B. Bond C.T. Lutsenko S. Maylie J. Adelman J.P. Nature. 1998; 395: 503-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar), we provide evidence for additional modulation of hSK4 in lymphocytes, results that have important implications for the existence of accessory molecules and cell-specific KCa channel regulation. Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated on a Ficoll-Paque (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Baie D'Urfé, Quebec, Canada) density gradient. To purify resting T cells, monocytes and B lymphocytes were removed by adhering them to a nylon wool column for ∼1 h and then eluting the T cells, which were then placed in culture medium containing RPMI 1640 with l-glutamine (Life Technologies, Inc., Burlington, Ontario, Canada) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Sigma, Mississauga, Ontario, Canada) and 50 μg/ml gentamicin sulfate (Life Technologies, Inc.). Mitogenically activated T lymphocytes (lymphoblasts) were prepared by treating the mixed mononuclear cells with 7 μg/ml phytohemagglutinin (PHA-P, Sigma) and growing them in culture medium in a humidified 37 °C incubator with 5% CO2 for 3–4 days. PHA selectively stimulates T cell proliferation, and monocytes die during prolonged culture. Cloning and expression of hSK4 in CHO cells was as described previously (7Joiner W.J. Wang L.-Y. Tang M.D. Kaczmarek L.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11013-11018Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). The full-length hSK4 clone was isolated from a human placental cDNA library, subcloned into pcDNA3 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), and transfected, using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.), into Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells that had been grown to ∼50% confluency. Stable transfectants were selected using Geneticin (Life Technologies, Inc.) and subsequently separated into clonal populations by single-cell sorting (FACSIV, Yale Cell-sorting Facility). Two cell lines with similar current densities were selected for electrophysiological characterization. These were grown in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, HT supplement, antibiotic/antimycotic, and 1 mg/ml Geneticin (all reagents from Life Technologies, Inc.). Total RNA was isolated from resting and activated human T lymphocytes, rat lung, and human placenta using the guanidinium isothiocyanate method (18Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63232) Google Scholar) and subjected to DNase I digestion (0.1 units/ml, 15 min, 37 °C; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Toronto, Ontario, Canada) to eliminate genomic contamination. First strand cDNA was synthesized according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using an oligo(dT)-based primer. The cDNA was then used as a template for PCR reactions using the following primers: Kv1.3 (GenBankTM accession number M30312) forward primer 5′ AATGAGTACTTCTTCGACCGCAACAGACCCAGCTTCGA 3′ and reverse primer 5′ CCAATGAAAAGGAAAATGAGCAGCCCCAG 3′; hSK4 (GenBankTM accession number AF000972) forward primer 5′ GTGCGTGCAGGATTTAGG 3′ and reverse primer 5′ TGCTAAGCAGCTCAGTCAGGG 3′. The PCR reaction was conducted with 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 μm forward and reverse primers, and 10% of the cDNA reaction mixture, using a Minicycler system (MJ Research, Watertown, MA). After incubating the mixture at 85 °C for 1 min, 1.25 units of Taq DNA polymerase (Sangon Ltd., Toronto, Ontario, Canada) was added and heated to 94 °C for 3 min, followed by 30 cycles through a 1-min denaturation step at 94 °C, a 1-min annealing step at 50 °C, and a 3-min extension step at 72 °C. A final extension for 5 min at 72 °C was followed by incubation at 4 °C until further processing of samples. After PCR, the DNA products were resolved in 2% agarose gels containing 0.5 mg/ml ethidium bromide. The identities of PCR-amplified fragments of the predicted sizes (856 bp for hSK4 and 790 bp for Kv1.3) were confirmed by restriction endonuclease digestion, which yielded the correct size bands on an agarose gel. By using additional hSK4 PCR primers, we then amplified cDNA encoding the entire open reading frame (1284 bp). Cloning and subsequent sequencing revealed 100% homology with the published amino acid sequences of hSK4/hIK1/hKCa4 (7Joiner W.J. Wang L.-Y. Tang M.D. Kaczmarek L.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11013-11018Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar, 8Ishii T.M. Silvia C. Hirschberg B. Bond C.T. Adelman J.P. Maylie J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11651-11656Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar, 9Logsdon N.J. Kang J. Togo J.A. Christian E.P. Aiyar J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32723-32726Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). RNase protection assays on T cells, lung, and placenta were performed using the amplified cDNA fragments for hSK4 and Kv1.3 as probes. To obtain RNA probes, these fragments were linearized with SmaI (for Kv1.3) orMluI (for hSK4) and in vitro transcribed with [α-32P]dUTP and T7 RNA polymerase, yielding RNA transcripts of 579 (Kv1.3) and 254 bp (hSK4). However, since about 66 bp of non-hybridizing vector sequence was included in each probe, the protected channel fragments should be 513 (Kv1.3) and 188 bp (hSK4). A control plasmid (mouse β-actin cDNA), purchased from Ambion and transcribed according to the supplier's instructions, should yield an RNase-protected fragment of 250 bp. Because of the great abundance of β-actin mRNA in these cells, the β-actin probe was labeled to a low specific activity (∼600-fold lower than hSK4 and Kv1.3) to allow simultaneous quantitation. For each experimental data point, 10 μg of total RNA was used, with 5 μg of yeast tRNA as a negative control for probe self-protection bands. Following hybridization and RNase digestion, the samples were electrophoresed in polyacrylamide gels, dried, and exposed overnight to x-ray film (X-Omat, Eastman Kodak Co.). Specific signals were quantified by densitometic analysis of the developed film using a Bio-Rad model Gs-670 densitometer, and results are expressed as mean ± S.D. with statistical analyses using the Student's t test. An XhoI site was added by PCR to the C terminus of the full-length hSK4, and then a pair of Flag-encoding oligonucleotides was spliced into this site. This construct was used to create a second proto-construct in which all transmembrane domains were eliminated, and a consensus Kozak sequence was added to the beginning of the cytoplasmic C terminus. Morph mutagenesis (5 Prime → 3 Prime, Inc., Arapaho, CO) was used to add a second, silent EcoRV site and a second XhoI site to the C termini of each proto-construct. Derivatives of these proto-constructs (for details, see text accompanying Fig. 7) were created by cutting out the fragments flanked by either EcoRV or XhoI and religating the larger fragment. CHO cells stably expressing Flag-tagged hSK4 constructs were grown to confluency in 100-mm Petri dishes. To assess binding of hSK4 protein to calmodulin-Sepharose, we used methods modified from Chapin et al. (19Chapin S.J. Enrich C. Aroeti B. Havel R.J. Mostov K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1336-1342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The dishes were washed three times in cold phosphate-buffered saline containing calcium and magnesium. Then, 1 ml of ice-cold solubilization buffer was added, which contained 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 1% Triton X-114 (Sigma), and protease inhibitors (5 μg/ml pepstatin, 10 μg/ml chymostatin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml antipain, 500 μm benzamidine, 0.1% Trasylol), and the dishes were rotated for 15 min at 4 °C. The lysate was triturated with a 23.5-gauge needle, and after removing insoluble material by centrifugation (15 min, 4 °C) the supernatant was transferred to a new tube to which 6 μl of 0.5 m EGTA was added (final concentration, 3 mm) to chelate the calcium. To promote Triton X-114 phase partitioning, this solution was warmed to 37 °C for 3 min and then centrifuged (5 min, room temperature) at full speed in a microcentrifuge. The detergent phase (bottom) was resuspended (5 min, 4 °C) in 900 μg of cold calcium-free wash buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mmMgCl2, 3 mm EGTA). The entire phase-separation procedure was repeated, and then the detergent phase was diluted 9:1 in an ice-cold “binding” buffer containing calcium (50 mmTris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mmMgCl2, 0.5 mm CaCl2) and incubated for 5 min at 4 °C. The protein samples were pre-cleared (1–3 h, 4 °C) with 50 μl of Sepharose Cl-2B. The pre-cleared sample (500 μl) plus binding buffer (450 μl) was added to a 20% slurry (50 μl) of calmodulin-conjugated agarose beads (Sigma) that had been equilibrated through a series of buffers, ending with binding buffer. The entire sample in binding buffer was incubated overnight at 4 °C on a rotator. For CaM antagonist competition experiments, 1000 nm calmidazolium was added to the sample slurry before the overnight incubation. The beads were pelleted by a brief microcentrifuge spin (∼5 s, 4 °C) and washed with 1 ml of binding buffer containing the detergent, Triton X-100, first at 0.5% and then at 0.05%. This was followed by a 5-min incubation at 4 °C in the 0.05% Triton X-100 solution, with or without 3 mmEGTA. The beads were harvested as before and washed once with detergent-free binding buffer with or without EGTA. The proteins were dissociated from the calmodulin-conjugated agarose beads by boiling them 5 min in 60 μl of Laemmli buffer. The resulting protein sample was analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blotting using a biotinylated anti-Flag antibody and an avidin-horseradish peroxidase-coupled secondary antibody (both from Sigma). Activated T lymphoblasts were used 3–4 days after PHA stimulation, at which time IK current amplitudes are much larger than in resting T cells at the same cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentration (5Grissmer S. Nguyen A.N. Cahalan M.D. J. Gen. Physiol. 1993; 102: 601-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Whole-cell currents were measured using an Axopatch 200 amplifier, with 8–12 MΩ pipettes. During data acquisition, capacitive currents were canceled by analogue subtraction, 50–70% series resistance compensation was used, and all currents were filtered at 2 kHz. All voltages were corrected to account for the junction potential between bath and pipette solutions. The bath contained the following (in mm): 145 sodium aspartate, 5 KCl, 1 MgCl2, 1 CaCl2, 5 HEPES, adjusted with NaOH to pH 7.4, 270–283 mosmol. The K+selectivity was verified and current rectification examined by replacing the sodium aspartate with 80 mm sodium aspartate, 65 mm potassium aspartate (70 mm K+solution), or 145 mm potassium aspartate (150 K+ solution). To activate fully the IK channels (5Grissmer S. Nguyen A.N. Cahalan M.D. J. Gen. Physiol. 1993; 102: 601-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar), we used a high Ca2+ (1.1 μm) pipette solution, consisting of the following (in mm): 140 potassium aspartate, 1 K4BAPTA, 2 K2ATP, 0.9 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, 5 HEPES adjusted to pH 7.2 with KOH, 260–270 mosmol. Contributions from volume-sensitive Cl− currents (20Schumacher P.A. Sakellaropoulos G. Phipps D.J. Schlichter L.C. J. Membr. Biol. 1995; 145: 217-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) were small since aspartate was used in the bath and pipette, and the internal solution was slightly hypo-osmotic. Fresh K2ATP (Sigma) was always added to pipette solutions just before use to help maintain channel and second-messenger activity during whole-cell recording. Stably transfected CHO cells were passaged every 3–4 days using trypsin/EDTA (Life Technologies, Inc.). Recordings were made 1–2 days after replating, using an Axopatch 1D amplifier (Axon Instruments). Pipettes had resistances of 3–5 MΩ, on-line capacitance compensation, and 60–80% series resistance compensation were used, and data were filtered at 2 kHz. The bath contained (in mm) 140 NaCl, 5 KCl, 1 CaCl2, 29 glucose, 25 HEPES, pH 7.4, and the pipette contained 32.5 KCl, 97.5 potassium gluconate, 5 MgATP, 4.3 CaCl2 (free Ca2+, 1 μm), 5 EGTA, 20 HEPES, pH 7.2. Conventional voltage clamp recordings were used to measure whole-cell K+ currents and current clamp recordings used to measure membrane potential. Free Ca2+ concentrations were calculated assuming a dissociation constant (K d) of 10−11 for the EGTA4-·2 Ca2+ complex and 10−7m for the BAPTA4-·2 Ca2+ complex at pH 7.2, and allowing for the weak calcium binding by ATP. When calmodulin (CaM) was added to the pipette, CaCl2 was increased to 0.91 mm (rather than 0.90 mm) to maintain the free Ca2+concentration (Ca2+i) at 1.1 μm, according to the following chemical information. Ca2+ binds to two globular domains in CaM, each with two Ca2+-binding sites (E-F hands) for a total of four binding sites (21Weinstein H. Mehler E.L. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1994; 56: 213-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). In principle, CaM can reduce free Ca2+i, but the effect of adding 50 μm CaM will be very small, as follows. At physiological KCl concentrations (K+ competes with Ca2+ binding to some extent), the affinity of CaM for Ca2+ is ∼100-fold lower than that of BAPTA, which is present at 1 mm in our pipette solutions. Since the mean of log K d is 5 for CaM (22Linse S. Helmersson A. Forsen S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8050-8054Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) versus 7 for BAPTA, the effect of 50 μm CaM on free Ca2+i is equivalent to adding a further 0.5 μm BAPTA. Data analysis was performed using pCLAMP (version 5.5 or 6, Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA), SigmaPlot (version 2, Jandel, San Rafael, CA), and Origin (version 4.1, Microcal, Northampton, MA). Where appropriate, data are presented as mean ± S.E., with paired Student's t tests (when each cell acted as its own control) or unpaired t tests used to determine the statistical significance of differences (95% confidence interval). All recordings were made at room temperature (19–22 °C), except when KN-62 and KN-04 were used at 37 °C. Activated lymphoblasts (stimulated for 3 days) and resting (naive) T cells were prepared as above and then seeded at 2 × 104 cells/well in 96-well plates (Corning Glass, Corning, NY) in culture medium. Cells were first incubated with or without K+ channel blockers for 10 min, and then 7 μg/ml PHA-P was added to either initiate or re-stimulate proliferation. After a further 3 days growth, the plates were spun (1,200 rpm for 15 min at room temperature); the supernatant was removed, and the plates were frozen at −80 °C (to aid subsequent cell lysis). Proliferation was calculated from the change in total nucleic acid content in each well using an assay (CyQUANT kit, Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) that measures the signal generated by binding of a fluorescent dye to nucleic acids, a signal that increases in proportion to the number of cells. Fluorescence signals were read from a 96-well plate using a plate-reader (CytoFluor II, PerSeptive Biosystems Inc., Framingham, MA) with excitation at 485 nm and emission at 530 nm. For each treatment, the average fluorescence from control wells (lymphocytes without mitogen or channel blocker) was subtracted from the average final fluorescence from treated wells to yield the change in fluorescence (nucleic acid content) during 3 days of proliferation. Results are expressed as the mean increase in fluorescence ± S.D. (n = 4 experiments, 4 replicates/experiment), and a Bonferroni multiple comparison test was used for statistical analysis. Changes in cell volume were measured using a flow cytometer (FACScan, Becton Dickinson, CA) by monitoring changes in right angle light scattering (side scatter) as an index of cell volume (23McGann L.E. Walterson M.L. Hogg L.M. Cytometry. 1988; 9: 33-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). To indicate percent change from the initial volume, we calculated a swelling index as (1/SSCh)/(1/SSCi) × 100, where SSCh is the average side scatter at each time after exposure to hypotonic medium and SSCi is the average value in isotonic medium. The flow cytometer was set to exclude dead cells and debris by omitting cells that stained with propidium iodide (0.04 μg/ml), a nuclear marker excluded by live cells. For control volume measurements, resting or activated T cells were suspended in isotonic medium which contained the following (in mm): 140 NaCl, 5 KCl, 1 MgCl2, 1 CaCl2, 10 HEPES, pH 7.4, 285 mosmol. Initial measurements were taken from 5000 live cells, and then aliquots of the same cells were exposed to a hypotonic medium (56% of normal osmolarity) with or without K+ channel blockers. The hypotonic medium contained the following (in mm): 70 NaCl, 5 KCl, 1 MgCl2, 1 CaCl2, 10 HEPES, pH 7.4, 159 mosmol. Side scatter was recorded from 5000 live cells every 30 s for the first 3 min and then at 6 min after the hypotonic shock. Whenever K+channel blockers were used, the initial volume was measured in the presence of drug before exposing the cells to hypotonic medium. Data were analyzed using CellQuest software (version 3.0.1f, Becton Dickinson). Values are presented as mean ± S.D. of at least 4 experiments per treatment, and a Bonferroni multiple comparison test was used for statistical analysis. Experiments were performed at room temperature (21–23 °C). We used the K+ channel blockers, charybdotoxin and iberiotoxin (purchased from Peptides International, Louisville, KY, or a gift from V. Gribkoff and S. Dworetzky, Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.), margatoxin and agitoxin-2 (Alomone Laboratories, Jerusalem, Israel), and apamin,d-tubocurarine, and clotrimazole (Sigma). The calmodulin antagonists, trifluoperazine and W-7 (N-(6-aminohexyl)-5-chloro-1-sulfonamide) were from Sigma. Bovine brain calmodulin, rat brain CaMKII, calmidazolium (compound R24571), and KN-62 (1-[N,O-bis(5-isoquinolinesulfonyl)-N-methyl-l-tyrosyl]-4-phenylpiperazine) were from Calbiochem. KN-04 (N-(1-[N-methyl-p-(5-isoquinolinesulfonyl)benzyl]-2-(4-phenylpiperazine)ethyl]-5-isoquinolinesulfonamide), an analogue of KN-62 without CaM kinase inhibitor activity, was purchased from Seikagaku America (Rockville, MD). These reagents (except KN-62 and KN-04) were prepared in bath saline, frozen in aliquots, and thawed just before use. KN-62 and KN-04 stock solutions were prepared in Me2SO and diluted in bath saline before use. The Me2SO concentration in the final bathing solution was ≤0.5% for T cells and ≤1% for CHO cells. Whenever cells were treated with KN-62, control cells were incubated in the same concentration of Me2SO for the same duration. We amplified DNA corresponding to full-length transcripts of hSK4 and Kv1.3 channels from activated human T lymphocytes. The open reading frame of the full-length hSK4 clone was 1284 bp, which encodes a protein of 428 amino acids that is 100% identical to the recently cloned hSK4 (7Joiner W.J. Wang L.-Y.

https://openalex.org/W2040120706,"We have previously reported on the cloning of XlEg5, a Xenopus laevis kinesin-related protein from thebimC family (Le Guellec, R., Paris, J., Couturier, A., Roghi, C., and Philippe, M. (1991) Mol. Cell. Biol. 11, 3395–3408) as well as pEg2, an Aurora-related serine/threonine kinase (Roghi, C., Giet, R., Uzbekov, R., Morin, N., Chartrain, I., Le Guellec, R., Couturier, A., Dorée, M., Philippe, M., and Prigent, C. (1998) J. Cell Sci. 111, 557–572). Inhibition of either XlEg5 or pEg2 activity during mitosis in Xenopus egg extract led to monopolar spindle formation. Here, we report that inXenopus XL2 cells, pEg2 and XlEg5 are both confined to separated centrosomes in prophase, and then to the microtubule spindle poles. We also show that pEg2 co-immunoprecipitates with XlEg5 from egg extracts and XL2 cell lysates. Both proteins can directly interactin vitro, but also through the two-hybrid system. Furthermore immunoprecipitated pEg2 were found to remain active when bound to the beads and phosphorylate XlEg5 present in the precipitate. Two-dimensional mapping of XlEg5 tryptic peptides phosphorylatedin vivo first confirmed that XlEg5 was phosphorylated by p34 cdc2 and next revealed that in vitro pEg2 kinase phosphorylated XlEg5 on the same stalk domain serine residue that was phosphorylated in metabolically labeled XL2 cells. The kinesin-related XlEg5 is to our knowledge the first in vivo substrate ever reported for an Aurora-related kinase. We have previously reported on the cloning of XlEg5, a Xenopus laevis kinesin-related protein from thebimC family (Le Guellec, R., Paris, J., Couturier, A., Roghi, C., and Philippe, M. (1991) Mol. Cell. Biol. 11, 3395–3408) as well as pEg2, an Aurora-related serine/threonine kinase (Roghi, C., Giet, R., Uzbekov, R., Morin, N., Chartrain, I., Le Guellec, R., Couturier, A., Dorée, M., Philippe, M., and Prigent, C. (1998) J. Cell Sci. 111, 557–572). Inhibition of either XlEg5 or pEg2 activity during mitosis in Xenopus egg extract led to monopolar spindle formation. Here, we report that inXenopus XL2 cells, pEg2 and XlEg5 are both confined to separated centrosomes in prophase, and then to the microtubule spindle poles. We also show that pEg2 co-immunoprecipitates with XlEg5 from egg extracts and XL2 cell lysates. Both proteins can directly interactin vitro, but also through the two-hybrid system. Furthermore immunoprecipitated pEg2 were found to remain active when bound to the beads and phosphorylate XlEg5 present in the precipitate. Two-dimensional mapping of XlEg5 tryptic peptides phosphorylatedin vivo first confirmed that XlEg5 was phosphorylated by p34 cdc2 and next revealed that in vitro pEg2 kinase phosphorylated XlEg5 on the same stalk domain serine residue that was phosphorylated in metabolically labeled XL2 cells. The kinesin-related XlEg5 is to our knowledge the first in vivo substrate ever reported for an Aurora-related kinase. Mitotic spindle assembly is a complex and essential event in the cell division process because it is a prerequisite for chromosome segregation (1Hyman A.A. Karsenti E. Cell. 1996; 84: 401-410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). During this process, motor proteins and the microtubules of the bipolar spindle ensure even distribution of the genomic information present in daughter cells (2Inoue S. Salmon E.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 1619-1640Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). In order to assemble the bipolar mitotic spindle in metaphase, cells re-organize their entire microtubule network upon entering in mitosis primarily by means of phosphorylation reactions (3Verde F. Labbe J.C. Dorèe M. Karsenti E. Nature. 1990; 343: 233-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar, 4Aizawa H. Kamijo M. Ohba Y. Mori A. Okuhara K. Kawasaki H. Murofushi H. Suzuki K. Yasuda H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 179: 1620-1626Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In the case of Xenopus laevis, a number of different activities that are required for the assembly of a bipolar spindle were isolated, that is to say, motor proteins such as kinesin-related proteins (XlEg5 1The abbreviations used are: XlEg5, X. laevis kinesin-like protein Eg5; BSA, bovine serum albumin; CENP-E, centromere protein E; GST, glutathioneS-transferase; IgG, immunoglobulin G; Ipl1, increase in ploidy 1; KLP61F, kinesin-like protein 61F; NuMA, nuclear mitotic apparatus protein; PP1 and PP2A, protein phosphatases 1 and 2A, respectively; TLC, thin layer cellulose; XKCM1, Xenopuskinesin central motor 1; XCTK2, Xenopus C-terminal kinesin 2; Xklp1, Xenopus kinesin-like protein 1; XlEg5HS, head and stalk domain of XlEg5; XlEg5ST, stalk and tail domain of XlEg5; XlEg5T, tail domain of XlEg5; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; NTA, nitrilotriacetic acid; IP, immunoprecipitation; TBS, Tris-buffered saline; TBST, Tris-buffered saline with Tween 20; IB, interaction buffer; PCR, polymerase chain reaction.

Motor protein activities such as association with microtubules, interaction with other proteins, and subcellular localization are regulated by phosphorylation reactions (18Sawin K.E. Mitchison T.J.

Biol. 1995; 15: 7143-7151Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). The X. laevis pEg2 centrosome protein kinase was first isolated through a differential screening undertaken during early development (22Paris J. Osborne H.B. Couturier A. Le Guellec R. Philippe M. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 72: 169-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). pEg2 mRNA belongs to the Eg family of mRNA, which is adenylated, recruited in polysomes, and translated in unfertilized eggs and deadenylated after fertilization (23Paris J. Philippe M. Dev. Biol. 1990; 140: 221-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The kinase was also recently isolated during a screen designed to isolate early players in the progesterone-induced maturation pathway of theXenopus oocyte. In the oocyte, the overexpression of active pEg2 accelerates the appearance of the germinal vesicle breakdown after contact with progesterone (24Andresson T. Ruderman J.V. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5627-5637Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). In Xenopus egg extracts, pEg2 kinase activity is required for mitotic spindle assembly (16Roghi C. Giet R. Uzbekov R. Morin N. Chartrain I. Le Guellec R. Couturier A. Dorée M. Philippe M. Prigent C. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 557-572Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). pEg2 is also a microtubule-associated protein (16Roghi C. Giet R. Uzbekov R. Morin N. Chartrain I. Le Guellec R. Couturier A. Dorée M. Philippe M. Prigent C. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 557-572Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In vitro pEg2 binds to paclitaxel-stabilized microtubules independently of its kinase activity (25Giet R. Prigent C. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 244: 470-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar), whereas in vivo pEg2 binds to mitotic microtubule structure and not to interphasic microtubule networks (25Giet R. Prigent C. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 244: 470-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). pEg2 belongs to a family of protein kinases related toDrosophila Aurora (26Glover D.M. Leibowitz M.H. McLean D.A. Parry H. Cell. 1995; 81: 95-105Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (700) Google Scholar) and Saccharomyces cerevisiae Ipl1 (increase in ploidy) (27Francisco L. Wang W. Chan C.S.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4731-4740Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Aurora gene mutation is characterized by a centrosome separation defect, a mechanism that needs to be completed in prophase to allow bipolar spindle assembly to occur (26Glover D.M. Leibowitz M.H. McLean D.A. Parry H. Cell. 1995; 81: 95-105Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (700) Google Scholar). The mutation manifestations in the Ipl1 gene show a chromosome segregation defect (27Francisco L. Wang W. Chan C.S.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4731-4740Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Three different Aurora-related kinases were found in mammalian cells (mouse and human) (28Kimura M. Kotani S. Hattori T. Sumi N. Yoshioka T. Todokoro K. Okano Y. J. Biol.

The X. laevis XlEg5 microtubule-based motor protein is a kinesin-related protein that was isolated through the same differential screening as pEg2 (5Le Guellec R. Paris J. Couturier A. Roghi C. Philippe M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3395-3408Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), and its mRNA behaves in the same manner of pEg2 mRNA during early development (23Paris J. Philippe M. Dev. Biol. 1990; 140: 221-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Like pEg2, XlEg5 activity is required for mitotic spindle assembly in Xenopus egg extract (34Sawin K.E. LeGuellec K. Philippe M. Mitchison T.J. Nature. 1992; 359: 540-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar). The XlEg5 sequence ranked it in the bimCfamily of kinesin-related protein, which includes yeast, fungus,Drosophila, and human proteins (35Enos A.P. Morris N.R. Cell. 1990; 60: 1019-1027Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar, 36Hagan I. Yanagida M. Nature. 1992; 356: 74-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 37Hoyt A. He L.

Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 665-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). All members of thebimC family have a highly preserved motor domain (N-terminal domain) and a small preserved domain in the tail domain (C-terminal domain) containing a threonine residue in a phosphorylation consensus sequence for p34 cdc2. The mutations of the potential phosphorylation site for p34 cdc2 in XlEg5 inhibited its binding to the mitotic spindle (18Sawin K.E. Mitchison T.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4289-4293Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). In addition, p34 cdc2 phosphorylation of the human Eg5 (HsEg5) threonine 1067 was shown to control any association with the spindlein vivo (19Blangy A. Lane H.A. d'Hérin P. Harper M. Kress M. Nigg E.A. Cell. 1995; 83: 1159-1169Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (788) Google Scholar) and interaction with the dynactin component p150 Glued (20Blangy A. Arnaud L. Nigg E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19418-19424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). XlEg5 was suspected to be required for centrosome separation because the phenotypes obtained after XlEg5 inhibition are reminiscent of those obtained after cytoplasmic dynein inhibition, which is involved in centrosome migration (19Blangy A. Lane H.A. d'Hérin P. Harper M. Kress M. Nigg E.A. Cell. 1995; 83: 1159-1169Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (788) Google Scholar, 40Vaisberg E.A. Koonce M.P. McIntosh J.R. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 849-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). In Drosophila, mutations in both Aurora (related to pEg2) and KLP61F (related to XlEg5) genes are characterized by improper centrosome positioning, leading to the formation of monopolar mitotic spindles (26Glover D.M. Leibowitz M.H. McLean D.A. Parry H. Cell. 1995; 81: 95-105Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (700) Google Scholar, 39Heck M.M. Pereira A. Pesavento P. Yannoni Y. Spradling A.C. Goldstein L.S. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 665-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 41Barton N.R. Pereira A.J. Goldstein L.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 1563-1574Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In Xenopus egg extracts, both the inhibition of XlEg5 through the addition of antibodies (34Sawin K.E. LeGuellec K. Philippe M. Mitchison T.J. Nature. 1992; 359: 540-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar) and the inhibition of pEg2 through the addition of an inactive dominant negative pEg2 form (16Roghi C. Giet R. Uzbekov R. Morin N. Chartrain I. Le Guellec R. Couturier A. Dorée M. Philippe M. Prigent C. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 557-572Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) provoke an inhibition of the mitotic spindle assembly. These results suggest that pEg2 may act on a substrate involved in centrosome separation, and one of the obvious candidates is the kinesin-related protein XlEg5. In Xenopus cultured cells, pEg2 associates with the centrosome in G2 and binds to microtubules at the mitotic spindle poles (16Roghi C. Giet R. Uzbekov R. Morin N. Chartrain I. Le Guellec R. Couturier A. Dorée M. Philippe M. Prigent C. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 557-572Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). XlEg5 also binds to the microtubules over the entire spindle (18Sawin K.E. Mitchison T.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4289-4293Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). In interphase XlEg5 staining has been described as a “weak cytoplasmic staining” and was not detected specifically around centrosomes (18Sawin K.E. Mitchison T.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4289-4293Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Here, we re-examined XlEg5 subcellular localization in Xenopus XL2 cultured cells and showed that the protein started to accumulate between the duplicated centrosomes at the end of S phase and associated with the centrosome in prophase where pEg2 was localized. In this study, we looked for evidence of direct interaction between pEg2 and XlEg5 and demonstrated that pEg2 associates with XlEg5. In addition, we demonstrated that pEg2 is capable of phosphorylating a serine in the stalk domain of XlEg5. Our results definitely suggest that XlEg5 is phosphorylated in vivo on two residues with two different kinases; a threonine residue is phosphorylated by p34 cdc2, and a serine is phosphorylated by pEg2. X. laevisoocytes and eggs were obtained from laboratory-reared females. The embryonic X. laevis cells XL2 (42Anizet M.P. Huwe B. Pays A. Picard J.J. In Vitro. 1981; 17: 267-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) were grown at 25 °C, without CO2 in L15 Leibovitz medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Bio Times) and antibiotic-antimycotic (Life Technologies, Inc.). All recombinant proteins were prepared from Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3)pLysS induced to overexpress the protein. pEg2-(His)6 and pEg2-K/R-(His)6 were prepared as described by Roghi et al. (16Roghi C. Giet R. Uzbekov R. Morin N. Chartrain I. Le Guellec R. Couturier A. Dorée M. Philippe M. Prigent C. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 557-572Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and Sup35-(His)6 as described by Frolova et al.(43Frolova L. Le Goff X. Zhouravleva G. Davydova E. Philippe M. Kisselev L. RNA. 1996; 2: 334-341PubMed Google Scholar). Histidine-tagged proteins were purified on a nickel-NTA-agarose column (Qiagen). All the histidine-tagged proteins proved soluble. Recombinant XlEg5 (GST-Eg5HS, GST-Eg5ST, and GST-Eg5T) proteins were prepared as described by Sawin et al. (34Sawin K.E. LeGuellec K. Philippe M. Mitchison T.J. Nature. 1992; 359: 540-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar). Because all three proteins were highly insoluble, they were affixed and used on glutathione-agarose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Anti-pEg2 1C1 antibody is a mouse monoclonal antibody described by Roghi et al. (16Roghi C. Giet R. Uzbekov R. Morin N. Chartrain I. Le Guellec R. Couturier A. Dorée M. Philippe M. Prigent C. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 557-572Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Anti-XlEg5 antibodies are rabbit polyclonal antibodies described by Sawin et al. (34Sawin K.E. LeGuellec K. Philippe M. Mitchison T.J. Nature. 1992; 359: 540-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar), with an anti-stalk/tail domain and an anti-tail domain. The antibodies raised against the C-terminal end of XlEg5 were purified on a nitrocellulose membrane containing the tail domain of XlEg5 fused to glutathione S-transferase. Briefly, 5 μg of GST-XlEg5T protein were run on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred onto nitrocellulose. The proteins were subsequently stained with Red Ponceau, and the bands corresponding to GST-XlEg5T protein were cut out. The various pieces of the membrane (10 cm2) were first incubated at 4 °C in TBST (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20) containing 5% dry skim milk for 2 h and then incubated overnight at 4 °C in 10 ml of TBST containing 2.5% milk and 1 ml of anti-tail domain serum. The pieces of the membrane were next washed with TBST, and the anti-tail antibodies were eluted with 2 ml of 100 mm glycine-HCl, pH 2.9, and immediately neutralized in 200 μl of 1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8. The purified antibodies were concentrated and washed with PBS in a Centricon 30 (Amicon) following the manufacturer's instructions. X. laevisXL2 cells were grown on round coverslips in 12-well plates (Corning Inc.) for 48 h, washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS: 136 mm NaCl, 26 mm KCl, 2 mmNa2HPO4, 2 mmKH2PO4, pH 7.2) and fixed by immersion in cold (−20 °C) methanol for 6 min. Following successive washes in PBS, the cells were blocked in PBS containing 3% BSA for 30 min and then incubated with both mouse anti-pEg2 monoclonal antibody 1C1 (20 μg/ml) and rabbit anti-XlEg5 purified polyclonal antibody (anti-tail) (dilution 1/60). The antibodies were sequentially revealed by fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (dilution 1/75) (Interchim) and Texas Red-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (dilution 1/35) (Interchim). All antibody reagents were diluted in PBS containing 1% BSA. Incubations were performed at room temperature for 60 min. The cells were rinsed in PBS containing 1% BSA between each incubation. The coverslips were rinsed in PBS and mounted in a Mowiol containing antifade. All samples were observed using a Zeiss fluorescent microscope (Axiovert 35) and photographed using a Nikon 601 camera. The egg extracts were prepared as described by Lohka and Maller (44Lohka M.J. Maller J.L. Exp. Cell Res. 1988; 179: 303-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) and diluted 10 times in a TBS-IP buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl, complemented with an IP buffer composed as followed: 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm EDTA, 3 mm EGTA, 5 mmglycerophosphate, 0.5 mm sodium vanadate, 0.5 μg/ml each leupeptin, pepstatin, and chymostatin). The XL2 cells were lysed in a PBS-IP buffer at 4 °C for 30 min. After centrifugation at 13,000 × g at 4 °C for 15 min, the supernatant was used for immunoprecipitation. Anti-pEg2 1C1 monoclonal antibodies were conjugated to protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), whereas anti-XlEg5 polyclonal antibodies were conjugated to protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). In both cases, the beads were saturated by incubation at 4 °C for 1 h in PBS containing an excess of antibodies and extensively washed with PBS. For the immunoprecipitation of XlEg5 from Xenopus XL2 cells, 50 μl of purified XlEg5 anti-tail domain antibodies (10 μg) were covalently bound to 50 μl of CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) following the manufacturer's instructions. Regarding immunoprecipitations, 10 μl of beads was added both to 50 μl of diluted egg extract and to 1.5 ml of cell lysate (2 × 106 cells) and incubated at 4 °C for 1 h on rotating wheel. After centrifugation, the beads were washed three times with 1 ml of a corresponding buffer (TBS-IP buffer or PBS-IP buffer). An additional 30-min wash on a rotating wheel was performed when labeled proteins were immunoprecipitated. The beads were then heat-denatured by incubation at 90 °C for 10 min in 20 μl of Laemmli sample buffer, and immunoprecipitated proteins were analyzed on SDS-polyacrylamide gels, followed by electrotransfer onto nitrocellulose membranes and then immunodetection (45Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar, 46Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44939) Google Scholar). If the beads were to be used for phosphorylation reactions, they were further washed twice with 1 ml of kinase buffer: 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mmdithiothreitol. The HpaI/XhoI pEg2 fragment cloned in pET21 (16Roghi C. Giet R. Uzbekov R. Morin N. Chartrain I. Le Guellec R. Couturier A. Dorée M. Philippe M. Prigent C. J.

A cDNA encoding the stalk and the tail domains of XlEg5 was PCR-amplified using a primer containing a BamHI restriction site (5′-CGCGGATCCTATGAGCACTTTGG-3′) and a primer containing anXhoI restriction site (5′-CAGAACTCGAGTTGTACATTC-3′). The PCR fragment was digested by BamHI and XhoI and subcloned in a pGADGH vector in the BamHI/SalI sites. The same strategy was used to clone a cDNA encoding the same part of XlEg5 in the pGBT9 vector except for the 5′ primer used for PCR (5′-CGCGGATCCGTATGAGCACTTTGG-3′).

Both pGADGH and pGBT9 vectors without insert were used as negative control, whereas pGADGH-XlEg5ST and pGBT9-XlEg5ST constructs were used as positive control. 10 μg of purified histidine-tagged protein (pEg2-(His)6 or Sup35-(His)6) were incubated at 4 °C with 10 μl of dried Ni-NTA-agarose beads in IMAC20 (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 20 mmimidazole) for 30 min. After extensive washing with IMAC20 buffer, the beads were incubated at 4 °C for 30 min in 100 μl of interaction buffer, which was IB (50 mm Tris-pH 8, 100 mmKCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1% Triton X-100, 20% glycerol) containing 1 μl of rabbit reticulocyte lysate previously programmed with XlEg5. The beads were then washed three times with 1 ml of IB containing 20 mm imidazole. Histidine-tagged proteins and proteins bound to histidine-tagged proteins were eluted with 15 μl of IB containing 250 mm imidazole. After heat denaturation in a Laemmli sample buffer (45Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) for 10 min at 90 °C, the proteins were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Electrophoresis on SDS-polyacrylamide gel was performed according to Laemmli (45Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) and gels transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes as described by Towbin et al.

The reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 15 min, stopped by addition of 10 μl of 2 × Laemmli SDS sample buffer and denatured at 90 °C for 10 min. The proteins were then separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, electrotransferred onto nitrocellulose membranes and analyzed by autoradiography. After serum starvation, the XL2 cells were blocked in the G1/S border by aphidicolin as described by Uzbekov et al. (49Uzbekov R. Chartrain I. Philippe M. Arlot-Bonnemains Y. Exp.

The precise molecular mechanisms by which Pyk2 activates distinct MAP kinase pathways are not yet fully understood. In this report, we provide evidence that the protein tyrosine kinase Src and adaptor proteins Grb2, Crk, and p130Cas act as downstream mediators of Pyk2 leading to the activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and c-Jun amino-terminal kinase (JNK). Pyk2-induced activation of Src is necessary for phosphorylation of Shc and p130Cas and their association with Grb2 and Crk, respectively, and for the activation of ERK and JNK cascades. Expression of a Grb2 mutant with a deletion of the amino-terminal Src homology 3 domain or the carboxyl-terminal tail of Sos strongly reduced Pyk2-induced ERK activation, with no apparent effect on JNK activity. Grb2 with a deleted carboxyl-terminal Src homology 3 domain partially blocked Pyk2-induced ERK and JNK pathways, whereas expression of dominant interfering mutants of p130Cas or Crk specifically inhibited JNK but not ERK activation by Pyk2. Taken together, our data reveal specific pathways that couple Pyk2 with MAP kinases: the Grb2/Sos complex connects Pyk2 to the activation of ERK, whereas adaptor proteins p130Cas and Crk link Pyk2 with the JNK pathway.

Cobb M.H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 180-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (2286) Google Scholar). MAP kinases have been implicated in the regulation of several fundamental cellular processes by transmitting extracellular signals from the cell membrane to the nucleus (1Robinson M.J. Cobb M.H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 180-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (2286) Google Scholar, 2Marshall C.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 179-185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4236) Google Scholar, 3Karin M. J.

Different MAP kinases are activated by signaling pathways composed of small GTPases and cytoplasmic kinase cascades (1Robinson M.J. Cobb M.H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 180-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (2286) Google Scholar). Key components of the ERK pathway include the small GTPase Ras, the serine/threonine kinase Raf, and MAP kinase kinase (Mek), which phosphorylates and activates ERK (4Schlessinger J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 273-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). The JNK pathway is composed of the Rho-related GTPases Rac and Cdc42 and a cytoplasmic kinase cascade in which Mek4 phosphorylates and activates JNK (5Davis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14553-14556Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Kyriakis J.M. Avruch J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24313-24316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1025) Google Scholar). Activated ERK and JNK phosphorylate transcription factors in the nucleus, leading to the modulation of gene expression (7Treisman R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 205-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (1163) Google Scholar). In most cases, the rate-limiting step in activation of the ERK and JNK pathways is the conversion of small GTPases from the inactive GDP-bound state to their active GTP-bound form (8Polakis P. McCormick F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9157-9160Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Cerione R.A. Zheng Y. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 216-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). The GDP/GTP exchange is modulated by guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs), which promote formation of the GTP-bound form, and by GTPase activating proteins (GAPs), which stimulate the rate of intrinsic GTP hydrolysis of G-proteins (8Polakis P. McCormick F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9157-9160Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Many GEFs for Ras and Rho-like GTPases identified in mammalian cells are bound to adaptor proteins, such as Grb2, Crk, or Nck (4Schlessinger J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 273-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar, 8Polakis P. McCormick F. J. Biol.

Scott J.D. Science. 1997; 278: 2075-2080Crossref PubMed Scopus (1900) Google Scholar). These adaptor proteins are composed of a SH2 domain and of one or more SH3 domains (10Pawson T. Scott J.D. Science. 1997; 278: 2075-2080Crossref PubMed Scopus (1900) Google Scholar). Upon cell stimulation, the SH2 domains of Grb2, Crk, and Nck bind to tyrosine-phosphorylated docking proteins, such as Shc, IRS-1, Frs2, Gab-1, or p130Cas, or directly to protein receptor tyrosine kinases (4Schlessinger J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 273-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar, 10Pawson T. Scott J.D. Science. 1997; 278: 2075-2080Crossref PubMed Scopus (1900) Google Scholar). Thereby, the adaptor protein/GEF complex is translocated to the plasma membrane, where GEFs catalyze the GDP/GTP exchange and activate membrane-bound GTPases (4Schlessinger J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 273-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar, 10Pawson T. Scott J.D. Science. 1997; 278: 2075-2080Crossref PubMed Scopus (1900) Google Scholar). The proline-rich tyrosine kinase (Pyk2) and focal adhesion kinase (FAK) constitute a distinct family of nonreceptor protein tyrosine kinases that are regulated by a variety of extracellular stimuli (11Neet K. Hunter T. Genes Cells. 1996; 1: 147-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Pyk2 is predominantly expressed in the central nervous system and cells derived from hematopoietic lineages, whereas its alternatively spliced isoform (Pyk2-H) is specifically expressed in T and B lymphocytes, monocytes, and natural killer cells (12Lev S.

In addition, several reports have shown that activation of Pyk2 is necessary for the activation of ERK and/or JNK in different cell lines and in response to diverse stimuli (12Lev S. Moreno H.

However, the molecular mechanisms by which Pyk2 transmits extracellular signals to specific MAP kinase signaling networks that control diverse cell responses are only partially understood. In this report, we show that Src acts in concert with Grb2/Sos and p130Cas/Crk complexes to mediate Pyk2-induced activation of specific MAP kinase cascades.

The mutation was confirmed by DNA sequencing. For transient transfections, 293T cells were grown on 6-well tissue culture plates in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. When the cells had reached 50% confluence, the medium was changed to serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, and the cells were incubated with expression vectors containing indicated cDNAs. After 6 h, an equal volume of 20% fetal calf serum/Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium was added and cells were grown for an additional 40 h. Empty expression vector was added when necessary to equalize the total amount of DNA transfected to 2 μg per well. Cells were lysed in Triton lysis buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm EGTA, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 20 mm NaF, 1 mm Pefabloc SC, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 5 μg/ml leupeptin). Cell lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, and total protein concentrations were determined by use of the Bradford protein assay (Bio-Rad). Equal amounts of lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with the indicated antibodies. Anti-Pyk2 (number 600) and anti-Grb2 (50Wu X. Knudsen B. Feller S. Zheng J. Sali A. Cowburn D.

Dikic I. Schlessinger J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14301-14308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). After 2 h, the beads were pelleted and washed three times with lysis buffer and once with phosphate-buffered saline. SDS gel loading buffer was added, the mixture was heated to 98 °C for 2 min, and proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE. For immunoblot analysis, proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose transfer membrane using a wet transfer unit from Bio-Rad. After blocking in Tris-buffered saline (150 mmNaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.7) supplemented with 5% bovine serum albumin, the filters were incubated with the appropriate antibodies for 1–2 h, washed several times with Tris-buffered saline containing 0.05% Triton X-100, and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-coupled anti-mouse IgG or protein A. The antibody-antigen complexes were visualized by a chemiluminescence detection system (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). To reprobe blots, they were incubated in stripping buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.7, 2% SDS, and 100 mm 2-mercaptoethanol) at 58 °C for 25 min, washed extensively with Tris-buffered saline, reblocked as described above, and reblotted with the appropriate antibodies. To determine Src activity lysates of transfected 293T cells were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-Src (Ab-1) antibodies and analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-Tyr(P)-416Src antibodies that recognize activated Src. Src kinase activity was quantified as an increase in Tyr(P)-416Src phosphorylation as described previously (14Dikic I. Tokiwa G. Lev S. Courtneidge S.A. Schlessinger J. Nature. 1996; 383: 547-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (879) Google Scholar). Polyclonal rabbit anti-Pyk2 antisera (600) and (623) were described previously (13Dikic I. Dikic I. Schlessinger J. J. Biol.

Polyclonal antibodies against p130Cas (N-17) and ERK2 (C-14) were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, and mouse monoclonal anti-p130Cas (P27820) and anti-Crk (C12620) antibodies were from Transduction Laboratories. Rabbit polyclonal anti-Crk antibodies (336) were generated against a carboxyl-terminal peptide of Crk. Anti-HA tag antibodies (12CA5) were purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals, anti-FLAG tag antibodies (M2) were purchased from Kodak, anti-Src (Ab-1) antibodies were purchased from Oncogene Sciences and affinity purified anti-Tyr(P)-416Src antibodies were kindly provided by A. Laudano (University of New Hampshire). Mouse monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies (4G10) were obtained from C. Davis (New York University) and rabbit polyclonal anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies (72) were used as described previously (13Dikic I. Dikic I. Schlessinger J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14301-14308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Affinity-purified antibodies against activated ERK were kindly provided by L. Rönnstrand (Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research, Uppsala, Sweden). The use of polyclonal antisera to Grb2 (50, 86 and 327) and Shc (410) was described previously (38Dikic I. Batzer A.G. Blaikie P.

For exogenous substrate phosphorylation, equal amounts of lysates from transfected 293T cells were subjected to immunoprecipitations with antisera against Pyk2 (600). Immunoprecipitates were washed three times with lysis buffer and once with kinase buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm MnCl2, 5 mm MgCl2). One-half of the immunoprecipitates was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with anti-Pyk2 antibodies (623), whereas the other half was incubated with 50 μl of kinase buffer supplemented with 20 μg of poly(Glu-Tyr) (4:1), 20 μm of ATP including 5 μCi of [32P]ATP for 10 min at room temperature. The reaction was stopped by addition of 25 μl of SDS sample buffer, boiled for 2 min, and products were resolved by 7% SDS-PAGE. The increase in phosphorylation of poly(Glu-Tyr) was determined by quantitation with a bioimaging analyzer (Fuji BAS2000). To measure ERK2 kinase activity, polyclonal anti-ERK2 antibodies or anti-HA tag antibodies were used to precipitate ERK2 or HA-ERK2 from total cell lysates. Precipitates were washed three times with lysis buffer and twice with reaction buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2). Myelin basic protein (MBP) (10 μg) was added to each immunoprecipitate as a substrate and kinase reactions (total volume, ∼30 μl) were initiated by addition of an ATP mix (final concentration, 200 μm ATP, including 1 μCi of [32P]ATP), incubated at room temperature for 20 min, and stopped by the addition of 20 μl of SDS sample buffer. The phosphorylated MBP was resolved by 12% SDS-PAGE, and gels were cut at the 30-kDa marker band. To assess equal kinase loads the upper part of gels was analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-ERK2 or anti-HA antibodies, and the lower part containing the phosphorylated substrate was visualized by autoradiography. The amount of 32P incorporated into MBP was quantified using a PhosphoImager. JNK activities were determined by in vitro kinase reactions using glutathione S-transferase (GST) c-Jun (1–79) fusion proteins as described previously (16Tokiwa G. Dikic I. Lev S. Schlessinger J. Science. 1996; 273: 792-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar, 34Dolfi F. Garzia-Guzman M. Ojaniemi M. Nakamura H. Matsuda M. Vuori K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15394-15399Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Briefly, lysates of cells transfected with HA-tagged JNK expression vector were incubated for 2 h on ice with polyclonal anti-HA antibodies. Immune complexes were collected on 30 μl of protein A-Sepharose beads for 30 min. The beads were washed three times with lysis buffer and twice with reaction buffer (40 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 10 mmMgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol) and assayed for phosphorylation of GST-c-Jun (1–79) in a final volume of 30 μl with 100 μm ATP and 2.5 μCi of [32P]ATP. After 20 min at 30 °C the reaction was stopped by the addition of SDS sample buffer. Following SDS-PAGE, the amount of 32P incorporated in GST-c-Jun (1–79) was determined by PhosphoImager analysis. HA-JNK expression levels were checked by anti-HA Western blotting of immune complexes, and the level of GST-c-Jun (1–79) substrate in each lane was visualized by Coomassie Blue staining. To investigate the signaling pathways responsible for Pyk2-induced activation of MAP kinases, we generated a series of expression vectors encoding for Pyk2 mutants (Fig. 1A). We first compared abilities of Pyk2, Pyk2-Y402F (tyrosine 402, the major autophosphorylation site and direct binding site for the Src SH2 domain, was mutated to phenylalanine), Pyk2-Y881F (tyrosine 881, a putative Grb2 binding site, was changed to phenylalanine), double mutant Pyk2-Y402F/Y881F and PKM to induce Src activation and tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins in human embryonic kidney 293T cells. Expression of Pyk2 or Pyk2-Y881F increased the phosphotyrosine content of cellular proteins and strongly activated endogenous Src proteins, whereas Pyk2-Y402F and Pyk2-Y402F/Y881F were severely impaired (to more than 90%) in their ability to undergo autophosphorylation, activate Src, and phosphorylate other cellular proteins (Fig. 1, Band C). PKM was completely unable to activate Src or to induce any tyrosine phosphorylation of cellular proteins (Fig. 1,B and C). In order to further analyze the enzymatic properties of different Pyk2 mutants, we compared theirin vitro kinase activities, measured by phosphorylation of the substrate poly(Glu-Tyr). Pyk2 and Pyk2-Y881F exhibited similar catalytic activities, whereas Pyk2-Y402F and Pyk2-Y402F/Y881F had decreased activities (15–35%) as compared with the wild type enzyme (Fig. 1D). The observed decrease in catalytic activitiesin vitro of these mutants could not account for the major reduction in their ability to phosphorylate cellular proteins in vivo (compare Fig. 1D to Fig. 1B). The fact that Pyk2-Y402F and Pyk2-Y402F/Y881F are unable to activate Src (Fig. 1C) indicates that activation of Src kinases by binding to Tyr-402 of Pyk2 plays a critical role in mediating Pyk2-induced phosphorylation of cellular proteins. We were further interested to identify cellular proteins that link Pyk2 with the activation of MAP kinases. Pyk2 was suggested to activate ERK by directly binding the Grb2/Sos complex or indirectly via Grb2 binding to tyrosine-phosphorylated Shc proteins (12Lev S. Moreno H. Martinez R. Canoll P. Peles E.

A. 1998; 95: 5051-5056Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). We therefore analyzed the ability of different Pyk2 mutants expressed in 293T cells to interact with Grb2. Expression of wild type Pyk2 or Pyk2-Y881F mutant induced phosphorylation of Shc and its association with Grb2 (Fig. 2A), whereas expression of Pyk2-Y402F, Pyk2-Y402F/Y881F, or PKM did not lead to any significant increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc or its association with Grb2 (Fig. 2A). In parallel, the same cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-Pyk2 and anti-Grb2 antibodies and analyzed by immunoblotting with respective antibodies. Wild type Pyk2 was associated with Grb2, whereas mutation of Tyr-881 to phenylalanine in Pyk2 led to a complete loss of its ability to co-precipitate with Grb2 (Fig. 2B), confirming that Tyr-881 of Pyk2 serves as a direct binding site for Grb2. We also found that Pyk2-Y402F, Pyk2-Y402F/Y881F, and PKM were not able to bind and co-precipitate Grb2 (Fig. 2B). In addition, when Pyk2 was co-transfected with the increasing amounts of a Src kinase inactive mutant (SrcK−), the ability of Pyk2 to bind Grb2 was significantly reduced (Fig. 2C). These data, together with previous findin"
https://openalex.org/W1967710456,"Small heat shock proteins (sHsps), including α-crystallin, represent a conserved and ubiquitous family of proteins. They form large oligomers, ranging in size from 140 to more than 800 kDa, which seem to be important for the interaction with non-native proteins as molecular chaperones. Here we analyzed the stability and oligomeric structure of murine Hsp25 and its correlation with function. Upon unfolding, the tertiary and quaternary structure of Hsp25 is rapidly lost, whereas the secondary structure remains remarkably stable. Unfolding is completely reversible, leading to native hexadecameric structures. These oligomers are in a concentration-dependent equilibrium with tetramers and dimers, indicating that tetramers assembled from dimers represent the basic building blocks of Hsp25 oligomers. At high temperatures, the Hsp25 complexes increase in molecular mass, consistent with the appearance of ""heat shock granules"" <i>in vivo</i> after heat treatment. This high molecular mass ""heat shock form"" of Hsp25 is in a slow equilibrium with hexadecameric Hsp25. Thus, it does not represent an off-pathway reaction. Interestingly, the heat shock form exhibits unchanged chaperone activity even after incubation at 80 °C. We conclude that Hsp25 is a dynamic tetramer of tetramers with a unique ability to refold and reassemble into its active quaternary structure after denaturation. So-called heat shock granules, which have been reported to appear in response to stress, seem to represent a novel functional species of Hsp25."

Since the substrates pantothenate, biotin, and lipoate carry one negative charge at physiological pH, the transport process is electrogenic. Thus the transport system is energized by both the Na+ gradient as well as the potential difference that exist across the cell membrane. Sodium-dependent pantothenate and biotin transport systems have also been individually characterized in brush border membrane vesicles isolated from the intestine and kidney of rat, rabbit, and human (4Fenstermacher D.K.

The cloned cDNA, when expressed in HeLa cells, induces Na+-dependent pantothenate and biotin transport activities. The cDNA-specific uptake of both pantothenate and biotin is inhibitable by lipoate. The transporter has a Michaelis-Menten constant (K t) of ∼5 μm for pantothenate and ∼15 μm for biotin. The nucleotide sequence of the cloned transporter predicts a protein of 68.6 kDa with 634 amino acids and 12 potential transmembrane domains. Comparison of the protein sequence of SMVT with other proteins entered in the Swiss-Prot data base shows significant sequence homology with known members of the Na+-dependent glucose transporter family. In this study, we describe the molecular cloning and structural and functional characterization of the human sodium-dependent multivitamin transporter from a placental choriocarcinoma cell line (JAR). This transporter is homologous to the transporter cloned from the rat placenta. The cloned transporter has been characterized by expressing the transporter in human retinal pigmental epithelial (HRPE) cells and in Xenopus laevis oocytes and by analyzing its transport function by tracer uptake and electrophysiological methods. Northern blot analysis shows that the transcript of hSMVT of 3.2 kbp in size is widely expressed in human tissues. The exon-intron organization and chromosomal localization of the human SMVT gene are also presented.

Subconfluent HRPE cells grown on 24-well plates were first infected with a recombinant (VTF7–3) vaccinia virus encoding T7 RNA polymerase and then transfected with the plasmid carrying the full-length cDNA. After 10–12 h post-transfection, uptake measurements were made at room temperature with [14C]pantothenate and [3H]biotin. The uptake medium was 25 mm Hepes/Tris, pH 7.5, containing 140 mm NaCl, 5.4 mm KCl, 1.8 mmCaCl2, 0.8 mm MgSO4, and 5 mm glucose. In most experiments, the time of incubation was 30 min. Endogenous transport was always determined in parallel using cells transfected with empty vector. This transport accounted for 15–25% of the transport measured in cells that were transfected with the vector carrying the cDNA insert. Therefore, the transport values measured in cells transfected with empty vector were always subtracted from the corresponding transport values measured in cells transfected with vector-cDNA to obtain the cDNA-specific uptake of the vitamins. cRNA from the cloned hSMVT-cDNA was synthesized using the MEGAscript kit (Ambion) according to manufacturer's protocol. The cDNA was linearized using NotI, and the cDNA insert was transcribed in vitro using T7 RNA polymerase in the presence of an RNA cap analog. The resultant cRNA was purified by multiple extractions with phenol/chloroform and precipitated with ethanol. Mature oocytes from X. laevis were isolated by treatment with collagenase A (1.6 mg/ml), manually defolliculated, and maintained at 18 °C in modified Barth's medium supplemented with 10 mg/liter gentamycin (22Parent L.S. Supplisson S. Loo D.D.F. Wright E.M. J. Membr. Biol. 1992; 125: 49-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). On the following day, oocytes were injected with 50 ng of cRNA. Oocytes injected with water served as control. The oocytes were used for electrophysiological studies 6 days after cRNA injection. Electrophysiological studies were done by the conventional two-microelectrode voltage clamp method (23Loo D.D.F. Hazama A. Supplisson S. Turk E. Wright E.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Acta. 1996; 1284: 125-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Oocytes were superfused with a NaCl-containing buffer (100 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 3 mm Hepes, 3 mm Mes, and 3 mm Tris, pH 7.5) followed by the same buffer containing varying amounts of either pantothenate, biotin, or lipoate. The membrane potential was held steady at −50 mV. For studies involving the current-voltage (I-V) relationship, step changes in membrane potential were applied, each for a duration of 100 ms in 20-mV increments. Kinetic parameters for the saturable transport of the three substrates were calculated using the Michaelis-Menten equation. Data were analyzed by nonlinear regression. Tissue distribution of the hSMVT-specific transcripts was determined by Northern blot. A commercially available membrane blot containing size-fractionated poly(A)+mRNA from several tissues of human origin (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) was used for this purpose. The full-length hSMVT cDNA labeled with [α-32P]dCTP was used as the probe. Hybridization was performed at 42 °C in 6× SSPE, 50% formamide, 10× Denhardt's solution, 2% SDS, and 100 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA. Post-hybridization washing was done at high stringency conditions that involved a final wash at 60 °C for 30 min in 0.5× SSPE in 0.5% SDS. This was done by screening a commercially available human placental genomic library (Lambda FIX II, Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) with a SalI/BglII fragment (∼0.65 kbp), comprising the 5′ end of the human SMVT cDNA, as the probe. Positive clones were isolated and plaque-purified by secondary and tertiary screening. The size of the genomic insert was determined by digestion with SalI and size-fractionation of the released insert on agarose gel. Digestion of the genomic clone withXbaI released 3 fragments (1.1, 5.0, and ∼9.0 kbp) of the genomic DNA insert. The 1.1- and 5-kbp fragments were subcloned into pSPORT. The complete nucleotide sequence of the cloned SMVTgene was obtained by sequencing the subcloned fragments and the phage DNA. The chromosomal localization of the human SMVT gene was done by somatic cell hybrid analysis, and the regional assignment of the gene on the chromosome was accomplished by FISH. In somatic cell hybrid analysis, the mapping panel number 2 consisting of mouse-human and Chinese hamster-human somatic cell hybrids, obtained from the Human Genetic Cell Repository (NIGMS, National Institutes of Health, Camden, NJ) was used. Each hybrid cell line contained a single human chromosome. DNA was isolated from the hybrid cells and digested with PstI. The restriction fragments were size-fractionated, transferred to nylon filters, and probed with full-length hSMVT cDNA as described previously (26Prasad P.D. Li H.W. Fei Y.J. Ganapathy M.E. Fujita T. Plumley L.H. Yang-Feng T.L. Leibach F.H. Ganapathy V. J. Neurochem. 1998; 70: 443-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). The cDNA was labeled with [32P]dCTP by random priming. For use in FISH, the entire phage DNA of the hSMVT genomic clone was labeled by nick translation with biotin-11-dUTP and used for hybridization to human metaphase chromosome spreads at a concentration of 50 ng/μl. FISH was carried out essentially as detailed earlier (27Shaper N.L. Lin S.P. Joziasse D.H. Kim D.Y. Yang-Feng T.L. Genomics. 1991; 12: 613-615Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The chromosomes were stained by the chromycin A3/distamycin A/4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole technique for fluorescent microscopic analysis. Earlier studies using placental membrane vesicles have demonstrated the presence of SMVT in the brush border membrane of the human placenta (1Grassl S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17760-17765Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Grassl S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22902-22906Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We characterized the uptake of pantothenate and biotin in the choriocarcinoma cell line JAR, and we showed that these cells express a transporter identical to the transporter that is expressed in the placental brush border membrane (3Prasad P.D. Ramamoorthy S. Leibach F.H. Ganapathy V. Placenta. 1997; 18: 527-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Unlike RNA isolated from the term placenta that is contaminated with RNA from other tissues like maternal decidua and non-trophoblast cells of the placenta, RNA highly specific to the trophoblast can be isolated from JAR cells in culture. With this in mind, we constructed and screened a JAR cell cDNA library to clone the human SMVT using the recently cloned rSMVT as the probe. Upon screening of approximately 3.6 × 105 colonies, several positive colonies were obtained, one of which was arbitrarily chosen for further characterization. The cDNA was designated hSMVT for human sodium-dependent multivitamin transporter. The hSMVT cDNA is 3162 bp long with an open reading frame of 1908 bp (including the termination codon), encoding a protein of 635 amino acids. The open reading frame is flanked by a 5′-noncoding sequence 391 bp long and a 863-bp long 3′-noncoding sequence (Fig. 1). The cDNA contains a poly(A)+ tail and a polyadenylation signal (AATAAA) in the 3′-noncoding region. The predicted molecular mass and pI of the protein encoded by the open reading frame are 68.7 and 8.6 kDa, respectively. Preceding the putative initiation codon is the Kozak consensus sequence (GAG GAT) (28Kozak M. Cell. 1986; 44: 283-292Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3598) Google Scholar). Hydrophobicity analysis of the predicted amino acid sequence using the algorithm of Kyte and Doolittle (29Kyte J. Doolittle R.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 105-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (17296) Google Scholar) with a window size of 20 amino acid residues indicated that the hSMVT protein contains 12 putative transmembrane domains. When modeled with both the amino terminus and the carboxyl terminus of the protein placed on the cytoplasmic side, there are four potential N-linked glycosylation sites (Asn138, Asn489, Asn498, and Asn534), the first site between transmembrane domains 3 and 4 and the other three sites between transmembrane domains 11 and 12. The deduced amino acid sequence also displays two sites (Ser283 and Thr286) with consensus sequence for protein kinase C-dependent phosphorylation (30Woodget J.R. Gould K.L. Hunter T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1986; 161: 177-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar, 31Kishimoto A. Nishiyama K. Nakanishi H. Uratsuji Y. Nomura H. Takeyama Y. Nishizuka Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 12492-12499Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in the cytoplasmic loop between transmembrane domains 6 and 7. Amino acid sequence comparison of hSMVT against rSMVT shows a high degree of homology (84% identity and 89% similarity) between the two proteins indicating that the protein is highly conserved across the species. Blast search (32Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (71456) Google Scholar) against known sequences in the Swiss-Prot data base shows considerable homology with members of the sodium-dependent glucose transporter family confirming that the protein is a member of this family. Among the sodium-dependent glucose transporter family members, the closest relative to SMVT with respect to amino acid sequence similarity is the sodium-dependent iodide transporter (40% identity and 64% similarity) (33Smanik P.A. Liu Q. Furminger T.L. Ryu K. Xing S. Mazzaferri E.L. Jhiang S.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 226: 339-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). The cDNA library used in this study was constructed in pSPORT vector with cDNA inserts unidirectionally ligated in such a way that the sense transcription of the cDNA is under the control of the T7 promoter in the plasmid. This made it possible to employ the transient vaccinia virus expression system for functional characterization of the clone. Initial experiments involving the time course of radiolabeled pantothenate uptake into vector- and cDNA-transfected cells indicated that the uptake of pantothenate was higher in cDNA-transfected cells than in vector-transfected cells. The uptake was also found to be linear up to 60 min, and hence all subsequent experiments were done with a 30-min incubation (data not shown). The ionic dependence of the cDNA-stimulated pantothenate uptake was investigated by measuring pantothenate transport in empty vector- and cDNA-transfected cells in the presence of various inorganic salts (Table I). Control uptake was measured in the presence of NaCl. Replacement of Na+ with other cations such as Li+, K+, choline, orN-methyl-d-glucamine almost completely abolished the pantothenate uptake in both vector- and cDNA-transfected cells indicating that Na+ is obligatory for the transport function. Such a marked inhibition was not seen when the Cl− in the buffer was replaced with gluconate suggesting the noninvolvement of Cl− in the transport process. Replacing Cl− with I− on the other hand reduced the uptake of the radiolabeled pantothenate by nearly 50%. It is not known at this time whether this inhibition is due to the change in the potential difference across the plasma membrane brought about by the prolonged incubation with NaI or if it is due to I−competing with pantothenate for the transport process. The latter hypothesis cannot be ruled out since, as mentioned earlier, hSMVT has very high sequence homology with the Na+/I−cotransporter.Table IIonic dependence of hSMVT-induced pantothenate uptakeInorganic saltcDNA-specific pantothenate uptakePercent controlpmol/10 6 cells/30 minNaCl85.0 ± 2.2100 ± 2.6Sodium gluconate60.7 ± 5.471.4 ± 6.4NaI44.6 ± 1.352.5 ± 1.6LiCl1.6 ± 0.21.8 ± 0.2KCl0.4 ± 0.10.5 ± 0.1Choline Cl0.2 ± 0.10.2 ± 0.1N-Methyl-d-glucamine Cl0.6 ± 0.30.7 ± 0.4HRPE cells transfected with either empty vector or with hSMVT cDNA were incubated with 1 μm [14C]pantothenate for 30 min at room temperature either in the control buffer (25 mm Hepes/Tris, pH 7.5, 5.4 mm KCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 0.8 mm MgSO4, 5 mm glucose, and 140 mm NaCl) or in buffer where NaCl was replaced with 140 mm various inorganic salts.

The substrate specificity of the transporter was evaluated by assessing the ability of various unlabeled vitamins and vitamin analogs to inhibit the transport of labeled pantothenate in pSPORT-transfected and pSPORT-cDNA-transfected cells (TableII). The cDNA-specific uptake was determined in these experiments, by subtracting the transport measured in the corresponding empty vector-transfected cells. Pantothenate, biotin, and oxidized lipoate were able to inhibit the uptake of radiolabeled pantothenate almost completely. Desthiobiotin, a biotin analog, also inhibited the uptake significantly indicating that the tetrahydrothiophene ring of biotin is not recognized by the transporter. Iminobiotin and diaminobiotin, two other biotin analogs, both of which lack the keto group at the second position of the imidazole ring of biotin, did not inhibit pantothenate uptake indicating that this group is involved in the interaction of biotin with the transporter. The two other water-soluble vitamins tested, namely niacinamide and thiamine, also had no influence on cDNA-induced pantothenate uptake. These results are similar to that obtained in pantothenate uptake studies using placental brush border membrane vesicles and JAR choriocarcinoma cells (2Grassl S.M. J. Biol.

Open table in a new tab HRPE cells were transfected with hSMVT cDNA as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Transport of radiolabeled pantothenate (1 μm) was measured for 30 min at room temperature in the presence or absence of indicated compounds (100 μm). Uptake measured in control cells transfected with empty vector was subtracted to obtain cDNA-specific uptake. The data represent means ± S.E. for three to six determinations. The kinetics of pantothenate uptake was determined by measuring the rate of pantothenate uptake at varying concentrations of pantothenate (0.25–10 μm) in HRPE cells transfected with the plasmid vector carrying the cDNA insert. Simultaneous measurements at identical concentrations of pantothenate were also done in empty vector-transfected cells. The values obtained were subtracted from the corresponding values of transport measured in cDNA-transfected cells to obtain cDNA-specific uptake. The data obtained were analyzed first by nonlinear regression analysis (Fig. 2A) and confirmed by linear regression (Fig. 2A, inset). The kinetics of biotin uptake by the cloned transporter was also determined similarly by measuring the rate of biotin uptake at varying concentrations of biotin (0.5–20 μm) (Fig. 2B). As can be seen from the figures, the cDNA-induced transport of both biotin and pantothenate is saturable. The experimental data were found to fit best to a model describing the uptake by a single carrier.

Atx1p specifically delivers copper to the Ccc2p copper transporter in the Golgi. Additionally, when overproduced, Atx1p substitutes for superoxide dismutase 1 in preventing oxidative damage; however the mechanistic overlap between these functions is unresolved. The crystal structure of Atx1p has been solved recently. By examining a surface electrostatic potential distribution, multiple conserved lysines are revealed on one face of Atx1p. An additional conserved lysine (Lys65) lies in close proximity to the metal binding site. Through site-directed mutagenesis, residues in the metal binding region including Lys65 were found to be necessary for both copper delivery to Ccc2p and for Atx1p antioxidant activity. Copper trafficking to Ccc2p also relied on the lysine-rich face of Atx1p. Surprisingly however, elimination of these lysines did not inhibit the antioxidant activity of Atx1p. We provide evidence that Atx1p does not suppress oxidative damage by a metallochaperone mechanism but may directly consume superoxide. Purified Cu-Atx1p reacts noncatalytically with superoxide anionin vitro. We conclude that the copper-trafficking and antioxidant functions of Atx1p arise from chemically and structurally distinct attributes of this metallochaperone.

Copper is required by all organisms as a cofactor for specific enzymes that participate in oxygen chemistry. In eukaryotes, copper metalloenzymes are found in multiple cellular locations including the cytosol, mitochondria, and cell surface (1Linder M.C. Linder M.C. Biochemistry of Copper. Plenum Press, New York1991: 1-13Crossref Google Scholar). Until recently, it was unknown how copper could be widely distributed in the cell for the activation of many copper enzymes. A new class of small proteins termed copper chaperones, or metallochaperones, deliver copper to specific intracellular targets (for review, see Ref. 2Valentine J.S. Gralla E.B. Science. 1997; 278: 817-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). All of the copper chaperones isolated to date were first identified in the bakers' yeastSaccharomyces cerevisiae, and functional homologues have been noted in Arabidopsis thaliana, Caenorhabditis elegans, mice, and humans (3Himelblau E.

In humans, this intracellular copper pump is encoded by the Wilson and Menkes disease genes (13Bull P.C. Cox D.W. Trends Genet. 1994; 10: 246-252Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar), and a functional homologue (Ccc2p) has been characterized in yeast (14Yuan D.S. Stearman R. Dancis A.

Via the action of Ccc2p, copper is incorporated into a multi-copper oxidase Fet3p, which translocates to the plasma membrane and works in conjunction with the iron permease to mediate high affinity iron uptake (14Yuan D.S.

Atx1p was not originally identified as a metallochaperone for Ccc2p, but rather as an antioxidant molecule (hence the name Atx1) capable of suppressing oxidative damage in yeast lacking SOD1 (17Lin S. Culotta V.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3784-3788Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Currently, nothing is known about the mechanism by which ATX1 acts as antioxidant. Atx1p is a prototype for a structural family of metal binding proteins and domains. Included in this family are MerP, a bacterial carrier for mercury ions (18Steele R.A. Opella S.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6885-6895Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), and the metal binding domains of the Ccc2p and Wilson and Menkes copper transporters (11Pufahl R. Singer C. Peariso K.L.

Homology among these various domains extends throughout the 8-kDa polypeptide segment, including an invariant metal binding motif, MXCXXC. The NMR structures for MerP (18Steele R.A. Opella S.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6885-6895Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar) and an Atx1-like domain of the Menkes transporter (19Gitschier J. Moffat B. Reilly D. Wood W.I. Fairbrother W.J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 47-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar) have been obtained, and very recently, the crystal structure of Atx1p has been solved (36Rosenzweig A.C. Huffman D.L. Hou M.Y. Wernimont A.K. Pufahl R.A. O'Halloran T.V. Structure (Lond.). 1999; (in press)Google Scholar). A common structural unit has been revealed, consisting of a βaββaβ fold and a metal binding site on the polypeptide surface (18Steele R.A. Opella S.J.

Using the crystal structure as a guide, we have employed a structure-function approach to probe the biological roles of Atx1p. Our studies have revealed that the antioxidant and metallochaperone functions of Atx1p require overlapping but distinct regions of the polypeptide. Furthermore, we provide evidence that the ATX1antioxidant function does not occur by a metallochaperone mechanism, but Atx1p itself may be acting as a scavenger of free radicals.

The sod1Δ atx1Δ strain PS114 was constructed by deleting SOD1 and ATX1 of SY1699 (21Horecka J. Kinsey P.T. Sprague G.F.

Stocks of yeast strains were maintained on a standard yeast extract-peptone-dextrose medium (22Sherman F. Fink G.R. Lawrence C.W. Methods in Yeast Genetics.

Yuan D.S. Klausner R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25660-25667Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). pMP025 was generated by mobilizing theATX1 fragment from pRSA-1 (17Lin S. Culotta V.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The majority of the mutant ATX1 alleles (K24,28E; K24,28A; K61,62E; K65E; K24,28,61,62E) were created by standard 4-primer polymerase chain reaction mutagenesis (25Higuchi R. Innis M.A. Gelfand D.H. Sninsky J.J. White T.J. PCR Protocols. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1990: 177-183Google Scholar) using outer primers engineered with BamHI and XhoI restriction sites to facilitate ligation of the polymerase chain reaction product into the pRS413 (CEN) and pRS423 (2-μm) vectors (24Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The remaining mutants (K61,62A; K65A; K65F) were generated using the QuikChangeTM site-directed mutagenesis kit from Stratagene (per instructions of the manufacturer) and the ATX1expression vectors p413-A1 (CEN) and pRS-A1 (2-μm) as templates. All mutants were confirmed by dideoxy automated sequencing (Johns Hopkins University CORE sequencing facility). The Atx1-Gal4 DNA binding domain fusions (for 2-hybrid analysis) were created as described previously (11Pufahl R. Singer C. Peariso K.L. Lin S.J. Schmidt P. Fahrni C. Culotta V.C. Penner-Hahn J.E. O'Halloran T.V. Science. 1997; 278: 853-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar), using the mutant alleles of ATX1as template for polymerase chain reaction. Two-hybrid studies were conducted essentially as described using the MATCHMAKER System (CLONTECH) (11Pufahl R. Singer C. Peariso K.L. Lin S.J. Schmidt P. Fahrni C. Culotta V.C. Penner-Hahn J.E. O'Halloran T.V. Science. 1997; 278: 853-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar) and the yeast strain MP101. For Western blot analysis, yeast cells were grown overnight in selecting synthetic dextrose medium to confluence, and protein extracts were prepared as described previously (10Lin S.J. Pufahl R. Dancis A. O'Halloran T.V. Culotta V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9215-9220Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). Extracts were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis using 14% precast Tris-glycine gels (Novex) followed by immunoblot analysis using a rabbit anti-Atx1p antibody diluted 1:1,000. The secondary antibody consisted of anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) diluted 1:10,000. Detection employed the ECL kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), according to the specifications of the manufacturer. The in vitro SOD activity studies utilized a purified Cu(I) Atx1p prepared according to previously described protocols (11Pufahl R. Singer C. Peariso K.L. Lin S.J. Schmidt P. Fahrni C. Culotta V.C. Penner-Hahn J.E. O'Halloran T.V. Science. 1997; 278: 853-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar), with the exception that Cu(I)(CH3CN)4PF6was used to load the protein rather than the combination of CuSO4 and dithiothreitol. Superoxide scavenging activity was measured by the standard cytochrome c/xanthine oxidase assay (26Fridovich I. Greenwald R.A. CRC Handbook for Methods in Oxygen Radical Research. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1985: 213-215Google Scholar) in buffers supplemented with 1.0 mm EDTA. The x-ray structure of Atx1p was recently solved at 1.02-Å resolution (36Rosenzweig A.C. Huffman D.L. Hou M.Y. Wernimont A.K. Pufahl R.A. O'Halloran T.V. Structure (Lond.). 1999; (in press)Google Scholar). Using the refined coordinates, a surface electrostatic potential distribution was generated with the program GRASP (27Nicholls A. Sharp K.A. Honig B. Proteins. 1991; 11: 281-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (5318) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). Examination of this distribution reveals a region comprising multiple lysine residues that generate a positively charged face on the protein surface (Fig. 1A). These basic residues are highly conserved between the yeast and human metallochaperones (Fig. 1B) and include: Lys24 and Lys28 located on α-helix 1 and loop 2, Lys61 and Lys62 located on α-helix 2, and Lys65 which is found in close proximity to the metal ion coordinated by cysteines at positions 15 and 18 (Fig. 1A). All three regions were targeted for mutagenesis, and substitutions engineered at these sites are summarized in Fig. 1B. atx1Δ strains are defective for iron uptake because of lack of copper incorporation into Fet3p (10Lin S.J. Pufahl R. Dancis A. O'Halloran T.V. Culotta V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9215-9220Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). Therefore, iron uptake provides a simple assay for monitoring Atx1p activity and can be used to obtain a qualitative estimate for how well copper is delivered from Atx1p to Ccc2p. Low copy CEN plasmids expressing mutant alleles of ATX1 (Fig. 1B) were used to transform an atx1Δ strain and were tested for the ability to support high affinity uptake of 55Fe. The majority of these Atx1p mutant variants accumulated to near wild-type levels when expressed in the atx1Δ strain (Fig. 2A). The lysine patches represented by K24,28 and K61,62 of Atx1p were found to be critical for the delivery of copper ions to Ccc2p. Altering K24,28 to acidic glutamates (K24,28E) resulted in an Atx1p molecule that was severely crippled in supporting iron uptake (Fig. 2B). Additionally, changing K61,62 to negatively charged glutamates and neutral alanines also reduced iron uptake, but to a lesser extent than was observed with mutations at K24,28 (Fig. 2B). Changing the overall charge of the Atx1p basic region from positive to negative in the K24,28,61,62E allele resulted in an Atx1p molecule that showed negligible capacity for supporting iron (Fig. 2B), underscoring the importance of the Atx1p lysine-rich face in the delivery of copper to Ccc2p and Fet3p. The very low level of iron uptake seen with K24,28,61,62E Atx1p may in fact represent an overestimation of mutant protein activity because iron starvation is known to induce Fet3p synthesis (28Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Stearman R. Dancis A. Klausner R.D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3377-3384Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). We recently observed that the two cysteines of the Atx1p metal binding site (MTCXXC) are essential for copper delivery to Ccc2p (29.Lin, S. J., Ph.D. thesis, 1997, Johns Hopkins University School of Public Health.Google Scholar). We additionally tested the role of Lys65 adjacent to this metal binding site. As seen in Fig. 2B, the K65E allele of Atx1p was severely crippled in this assay. Surprisingly, variants K65A and K65F each exhibited nearly wild type levels of activity (Fig. 2B) even though these alleles were expressed to very low degrees. Thus, a negative charge adjacent to the metal binding site of Atx1p prohibits copper delivery to Ccc2p, whereas a basic, neutral, or hydrophobic residue at this position appears well tolerated. As a second assay for Atx1p activity, we monitored physical interaction between Atx1p and Ccc2p by use of the 2-hybrid system. Consistent with previous results (11Pufahl R. Singer C. Peariso K.L. Lin S.J. Schmidt P. Fahrni C. Culotta V.C. Penner-Hahn J.E. O'Halloran T.V. Science. 1997; 278: 853-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar), a 2-hybrid signal can be detected in cells expressing Gal4 fusions to wild type Atx1p and to the metal binding domains of Ccc2p (Fig. 3, A andB). This interaction requires a functional metal binding site of Atx1p because a C15,18S mutation abolished the signal (Fig. 3A). Lys65 adjacent to the metal site, as well as lysines in the basic face of Atx1p, likewise seemed important for physical interaction with Ccc2p (Fig. 3B). It seemed surprising that K61,62E, which exhibited 50% activity in the iron uptake assay, was unscored for interaction with Ccc2p. As would be expected for a transient reaction, the 2-hybrid signal obtained with Atx1p is normally very weak (11Pufahl R. Singer C. Peariso K.L. Lin S.J. Schmidt P. Fahrni C. Culotta V.C. Penner-Hahn J.E. O'Halloran T.V. Science. 1997; 278: 853-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar), and any reduction in Atx1p recognition of Ccc2p is likely to lower the signal to levels beyond our detection. To define the regions of Atx1p needed for antioxidant protection, the various Atx1p mutants were expressed from a multi-copy 2-μm yeast vector in a strain lacking both Atx1p and Sod1p. As seen in Fig. 4, all mutants tested accumulated to the same high level obtained with wild type Atx1p. The antioxidant activity of each mutant was monitored by assaying for the ability to overcome the aerobic lysine auxotrophy ofsod1Δ cells. In the presence of oxygen (but not under anaerobic conditions), sod1Δ strains fail to grow on medium lacking lysine as a result of oxidative damage to component(s) of the lysine biosynthetic pathway (30Liu X.F. Elashvili I. Gralla E.B. Valentine J.S. Lapinskas P. Culotta V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18298-18302Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Bilinski T. Krawiec Z. Liczmanski L. Litwinska J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1985; 130: 533-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). This defect is suppressed by overexpressing wild type ATX1 (Fig. 4). Full suppression of oxidative damage was also achieved with Atx1p mutants targeting lysines 24 and 28. Moreover, the K24,28,61,62E variant of Atx1p, which was completely inactive for copper activation of Ccc2p and Fet3p (Fig. 2B), fully suppressed the aerobic lysine auxotrophy of the sod1Δ strain (Fig. 4). It was curious that the K61,62E allele failed to suppress oxidative damage, but the significance of this result is difficult to reconcile because these substitutions have no deleterious effect when present in combination with K24,28E (Fig. 4). In any case, changing the overall charge of the lysine-rich face from basic to acidic (in the case of K24,28,61,62E) resulted in an Atx1p molecule that was still wild type for suppressing oxidative damage. In comparison to results obtained with the lysine patch mutants, mutations directed at the metal binding region of Atx1p greatly inhibited its antioxidant activity. We previously found that the C15,18S mutant lacking the copper binding cysteine ligands fails to suppress the sod1Δ aerobic lysine auxotrophy (29.Lin, S. J., Ph.D. thesis, 1997, Johns Hopkins University School of Public Health.Google Scholar). Mutations that targeted Lys65 positioned near the metal site also affected antioxidant function. Alleles K65E and K65F were completely inactive, and the K65A mutant was only partially functional in this assay (Fig. 4). We addressed whether ATX1 suppresses oxidative damage by acting as a metallochaperone for a molecule other than Ccc2p. By definition, copper chaperones are only required under conditions of limiting cellular copper (9Glerum D.M. Shtanko A. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14504-14509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar, 10Lin S.J. Pufahl R. Dancis A. O'Halloran T.V. Culotta V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9215-9220Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar, 32Gamonet F. Lauquin G.J.-M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 251: 716-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 37Rae T.D. Schmidt P.J. Pufahl R.A. Culotta V.C. O'Halloran T.V. Science. 1999; : 805-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (1379) Google Scholar). Therefore, if Atx1p suppresses oxidative damage by acting as a metallochaperone, it should be possible to mimic this activity by high copper. However, we noted that treatment with high copper did not substitute for multi-copy ATX1 in suppressingsod1Δ defects (Fig. 5A). By contrast, the same treatment with copper quite effectively substituted for Atx1p in delivering copper to Ccc2p, as monitored by high affinity iron uptake (Fig. 5B). In fact, high copper treatment resulted in decreased physical interaction between Atx1p and Ccc2p, as revealed by 2-hybrid analysis (Fig. 5C), emphasizing the notion that copper chaperones are not required when copper is plentiful. Therefore, while Atx1p delivers copper to Ccc2p and Fet3p only under metal limiting conditions, the antioxidant behavior of Atx1p cannot be explained by a similar metallochaperone mechanism. We addressed whether Atx1p itself may serve as an antioxidant. By the standard cytochrome c/xanthine oxidase assay for SOD activity (26Fridovich I. Greenwald R.A. CRC Handbook for Methods in Oxygen Radical Research. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1985: 213-215Google Scholar), a purified Cu-Atx1p did exhibit the ability to consume superoxide, as demonstrated by the inhibition of cytochromec reduction rate at the reaction onset (Fig. 6, slope A). The activity obtained with 720 nm Cu-Atx1p was equivalent to that seen with 0.84 ± 0.09 nm Sod1 dimer, or 1.7 ± 0.18 nm Sod1 monomer; hence, the reaction of superoxide with Cu-Atx1 is approximately 430-fold less efficient than with Sod1. Moreover, with Atx1p, the rate of cytochrome c reduction toward the later portion of the assay, fit to slope B in Fig. 6, returned to the rate of the control sample, indicating that purified Atx1p does not act catalytically as a dismutase in vitro. Despite this limited activity, our calculations indicate that when Atx1p is over-produced in vivo, the corresponding superoxide consumption capacity may be sufficient to substitute for Sod1p (see “Discussion”). The x-ray structure of Atx1p reveals an intriguing patch of lysine residues along one face of the molecule, as well as an additional lysine (Lys65) adjacent to the MXCXXC metal binding site. We find that sequences in the metal coordination site, including the two copper binding cysteines and the neighboring Lys65, are necessary for both Atx1p activation of Ccc2p/Fet3p and for its antioxidant role. In comparison, the basic face of Atx1p (residues K24,28,61,62) is important only for copper distribution to Ccc2p but not for the antioxidant function of Atx1p, supporting the proposal that this region may be uniquely important for interactions between Atx1p and Ccc2p (36Rosenzweig A.C. Huffman D.L. Hou M.Y. Wernimont A.K. Pufahl R.A. O'Halloran T.V. Structure (Lond.). 1999; (in press)Google Scholar). A structurally characterized metal binding domain of the Menkes protein (19Gitschier J. Moffat B. Reilly D. Wood W.I. Fairbrother W.J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 47-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar) contains an acidic face, and a number of these acidic residues are conserved in Ccc2p (36Rosenzweig A.C. Huffman D.L. Hou M.Y. Wernimont A.K. Pufahl R.A. O'Halloran T.V. Structure (Lond.). 1999; (in press)Google Scholar). The mutagenesis data are consistent with the hypothesis that docking of Atx1p with Ccc2p involves electrostatic interactions between the basic face of the metallochaperone and the corresponding acidic face in its target protein (36Rosenzweig A.C. Huffman D.L. Hou M.Y. Wernimont A.K. Pufahl R.A. O'Halloran T.V. Structure (Lond.). 1999; (in press)Google Scholar). Previously, Gitlin and co-workers reported that lysines 57 and 60 of the HAH1 human homologue to Atx1p (corresponding to lysines 62 and 65 of Atx1p) are more critical for the antioxidant function of this metallochaperone than for delivery of copper to Ccc2p (33Hung I.H.

Although these conclusions appear to be at odds with our findings, the results of the two studies are in fact, compatible. With the crystal structure of Atx1p now in hand, allele K57,60G of HAH1 is predicted to impinge on both the metal binding region (Lys60) and on the basic patch (Lys57) of the metallochaperone and should, therefore, affect both activities of the metallochaperone. Accordingly, Gitlin and co-workers observed a partial reduction in copper delivery to Fet3p and complete inhibition of antioxidant activity with this mixed allele (33Hung I.H. Casareno R.L.B. Labesse G. Mathews F.S. Gitlin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1749-1754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). What is the significance of the essential basic residue near the metal binding site of Atx1p? This lysine is conserved among all known members of the Atx1p metallochaperone family, including those from plants (3Himelblau E. Mira H. Lin S.J. Culotta V.C. Penarrubia L. Amasino R.M. Plant Physiol. 1998; 117: 1227-1234Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), nematodes (6Wakabayashi T. Nakamura N. Sambongi Y. Wada Y. Oka T. Futai M. FEBS Lett. 1998; 440: 141-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), and mammals (4Klomp L.W.J. Lin S.J. Yuan D. Klausner R.D. Culotta V.C. Gitlin J.D. J. Biol.

In comparison, a hydrophobic aromatic residue is present at the corresponding position in 5 of 6 Atx1-like domains in the Wilson and Menkes proteins (19Gitschier J. Moffat B. Reilly D. Wood W.I. Fairbrother W.J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 47-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar) and in both of the metal binding domains of Ccc2p (11Pufahl R. Singer C. Peariso K.L. Lin S.J. Schmidt P. Fahrni C. Culotta V.C. Penner-Hahn J.E. O'Halloran T.V. Science. 1997; 278: 853-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar, 36Rosenzweig A.C. Huffman D.L. Hou M.Y. Wernimont A.K. Pufahl R.A. O'Halloran T.V. Structure (Lond.). 1999; (in press)Google Scholar). In the case of Atx1p, Lys65 may affect the kinetics or thermodynamics of copper-protein interaction through hydrogen bonding to a coordinated cysteine sulfur atom. Lys65 is predicted to partially neutralize the net negative charge that results from a coordination of two (or more) cysteinate anions to Cu(I) and would thereby stabilize the copper-chaperone complex. A working hypothesis is that allosteric conformation changes at Lys65 may occur in the docking of the chaperone with its partner Ccc2p (11Pufahl R. Singer C. Peariso K.L. Lin S.J. Schmidt P. Fahrni C. Culotta V.C. Penner-Hahn J.E. O'Halloran T.V. Science. 1997; 278: 853-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar). The studies presented here provide several lines of evidence that the antioxidant activity of Atx1p is distinct from its ability to act as a metallochaperone. First, the basic surface residues that are critical for copper delivery to Ccc2p are not needed for the antioxidant activity of Atx1p. Second, unlike other metallochaperone functions (9Glerum D.M. Shtanko A. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14504-14509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar,10Lin S.J. Pufahl R. Dancis A. O'Halloran T.V. Culotta V.C. J. Biol.

Science. 1999; : 805-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (1379) Google Scholar), high levels of copper cannot substitute for the antioxidant activity of Atx1p, indicating that Atx1p does not suppress oxidative damage by delivering copper to another molecule. Finally, we provide evidence that Atx1p itself acts as a scavenger of superoxide anion, albeit a poor one compared with Sod1p. Yet the level of activity observed with purified Atx1p in vitro may be sufficient to suppress sod1Δ deficiency in vivobased on the following calculations: approximately 430 molecules of Atx1p are needed to neutralize an equivalent amount of superoxide as 1 molecule of Sod1p. We observed that Atx1p is normally present at 1.5 × 104 molecules per cell (unpublished), but when over-produced, these levels reach ca. 5 × 105molecules per cell (10Lin S.J. Pufahl R. Dancis A. O'Halloran T.V. Culotta V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9215-9220Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). Because full suppression of aerobic lysine auxotrophy is achieved with ≤ 8 × 102 molecules of active Sod1p per cell (34Corson L.B. Strain J. Culotta V.C. Cleveland D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6361-6366Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), 1This calculation is based on reports that yeast cells harbor ∼4 × 104 active monomers Sod1p/cell (37Rae T.D. Schmidt P.J. Pufahl R.A. Culotta V.C. O'Halloran T.V. Science. 1999; : 805-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (1379) Google Scholar), and that ≤2% of the total Sod1p of a yeast cell yields wild type levels of protection against oxidative damage (34Corson L.B. Strain J. Culotta V.C. Cleveland D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6361-6366Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). The lower limit of Sod1p that is required for antioxidant protection has not been determined but is expected to be far less than the upper limit of 8 × 102 molecules/cell. it is conceivable that the superoxide consumption by multi-copy Atx1p is sufficient to substitute for Sod1p in this regard. This antioxidant activity appears to be physiologic and not simply an artifact ofATX1 overexpression because complete deletion of Atx1p causes paraquat sensitivity (17Lin S. Culotta V.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3784-3788Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). We conclude that this small copper binding molecule has evolved with dual and separable functions that aid in the handling of copper in aerobic environments. We thank Daniel Yuan for helpful discussions."
https://openalex.org/W1986887947,"Two genes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, LPP1 and DPP1, with homology to a mammalian phosphatidic acid (PA) phosphatase were identified and disrupted. Neither single nor combined deletions resulted in growth or secretion phenotypes. As observed previously (Toke, D. A., Bennett, W. L., Dillon, D. A., Wu, W.-I., Chen, X., Ostrander, D. B., Oshiro, J., Cremesti, A., Voelker, D. R., Fischl, A. S., and Carman, G. M. (1998) J. Biol. Chem. 273, 3278–3284; Toke, D. A., Bennett, W. L., Oshiro, J., Wu, W.-I., Voelker, D. R., and Carman, G. M. (1998) J. Biol. Chem. 273, 14331–14338), the disruption of DPP1 and LPP1 produced profound losses of Mg2+-independent PA phosphatase activity. The coincident attenuation of hydrolytic activity against diacylglycerol pyrophosphate prompted an examination of the effects of these disruptions on hydrolysis of isoprenoid pyrophosphates. Disruption of either LPP1 or DPP1 caused respective decreases of about 25 and 75% in Mg2+-independent hydrolysis of several isoprenoid phosphates by particulate fractions isolated from these cells. The particulate and cytosolic fractions from the double disruption (lpp1Δ dpp1Δ) showed essentially complete loss of Mg2+-independent hydrolytic activity toward dolichyl phosphate (dolichyl-P), dolichyl pyrophosphate (dolichyl-P-P), farnesyl pyrophosphate (farnesyl-P-P), and geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (geranylgeranyl-P-P). However, a modest Mg2+-stimulated activity toward PA and dolichyl-P was retained in cytosol fromlpp1Δ dpp1Δ cells. The action of Dpp1p on isoprenyl pyrophosphates was confirmed by characterization of the hydrolysis of geranylgeranyl-P-P by the purified protein. These results indicate that LPP1 and DPP1 account for most of the hydrolytic activities toward dolichyl-P-P, dolichyl-P, farnesyl-P-P, and geranylgeranyl-P-P but also suggest that yeast contain other enzymes capable of dephosphorylating these essential isoprenoid intermediates. Two genes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, LPP1 and DPP1, with homology to a mammalian phosphatidic acid (PA) phosphatase were identified and disrupted. Neither single nor combined deletions resulted in growth or secretion phenotypes. As observed previously (Toke, D. A., Bennett, W. L., Dillon, D. A., Wu, W.-I., Chen, X., Ostrander, D.

The coincident attenuation of hydrolytic activity against diacylglycerol pyrophosphate prompted an examination of the effects of these disruptions on hydrolysis of isoprenoid pyrophosphates. Disruption of either LPP1 or DPP1 caused respective decreases of about 25 and 75% in Mg2+-independent hydrolysis of several isoprenoid phosphates by particulate fractions isolated from these cells. The particulate and cytosolic fractions from the double disruption (lpp1Δ dpp1Δ) showed essentially complete loss of Mg2+-independent hydrolytic activity toward dolichyl phosphate (dolichyl-P), dolichyl pyrophosphate (dolichyl-P-P), farnesyl pyrophosphate (farnesyl-P-P), and geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (geranylgeranyl-P-P). However, a modest Mg2+-stimulated activity toward PA and dolichyl-P was retained in cytosol fromlpp1Δ dpp1Δ cells. The action of Dpp1p on isoprenyl pyrophosphates was confirmed by characterization of the hydrolysis of geranylgeranyl-P-P by the purified protein. These results indicate that LPP1 and DPP1 account for most of the hydrolytic activities toward dolichyl-P-P, dolichyl-P, farnesyl-P-P, and geranylgeranyl-P-P but also suggest that yeast contain other enzymes capable of dephosphorylating these essential isoprenoid intermediates. Phosphorylated lipids serve diverse roles in cellular metabolism, including signal transduction, membrane biosynthesis, and energy storage. These lipid phosphates are created through direct phosphorylation of lipids by lipid kinases such as diacylglycerol kinase and dolichol kinase which produce phosphatidic acid (PA) 1The abbreviations used are: PA, phosphatidic acid; LPA, lysophosphatidic acid; Man-P-Dol, mannosylphosphoryldolichol; dolichyl-P, dolichyl phosphate; dolichyl-P-P, dolichyl pyrophosphate; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; ORF, open reading frame. and dolichyl monophosphate (dolichyl-P), respectively. Alternatively, these molecules can be formed by degradation of precursor molecules as in the hydrolysis of phospholipids by phospholipase D to form PA or the transfer of oligosaccharides from a dolichol carrier to produce dolichyl pyrophosphate (dolichyl-P-P) or dolichyl-P (1Kornfeld R. Kornfeld S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 631-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (3779) Google Scholar). The phosphorylated lipids can be metabolized by several phosphatases or used in synthetic reactions to produce a variety of phospholipids or dolichyl oligosaccharides (2Carman G.M. Zeimetz G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13293-13296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 3Brindley D.N. Waggoner D.W. Chem. Phys.

PA serves as both a signaling molecule and as an important precursor of several phospholipids. In signal transduction, PA, created by the action of phospholipase D, may act directly as a second messenger or be hydrolyzed to diacylglycerol, another well characterized signaling molecule. At least two types of phosphatase activity can metabolize PA. A type I activity is dependent on Mg2+ and inhibited byN-ethylmaleimide, whereas a type II activity is independent of Mg2+ and insensitive to the alkylating agent (3Brindley D.N. Waggoner D.W. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1996; 80: 45-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The type I activity in Saccharomyces cerevisiae is found in both cytosolic and particulate fractions (7Carman G.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1348: 45-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 8Hosaka K. Yamashita S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 796: 102-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The activity in the particulate fraction has been purified to apparent homogeneity and corresponds to two integral membrane proteins with molecular masses of 104 and 45 kDa (9Morlock K.R. McLaughlin J.J. Lin Y.-P. Carman G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3586-3593Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although these activities have been characterized extensively (9Morlock K.R.

Methods Enzymol. 1991; 197: 548-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), the genes encoding the enzymes responsible have not been identified. The characterization of type II PA-phosphatase activities is more advanced. The purification of a type II activity from the particulate fraction of porcine thymus led to the isolation of a corresponding cDNA from mouse kidney (14Kai M. Wada I. Imai S. Sakane F. Kanoh H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18931-18938Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Yeast also contains type II activities associated with a particulate fraction (15Toke D.A.

In S. cerevisiae, two genes have been identified that have similar hydropathy profiles and are homologous to the mammalian enzyme. The conservation of amino acid sequence is particularly strong in three regions thought to form the active site of the enzymes (4Brindley D.N. Waggoner D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24281-24284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 16Stukey J. Carman G.M.

Dekker H.L. Barnett P. Wever R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 97: 2145-2149Crossref Scopus (172) Google Scholar). One of the type II activities in yeast also hydrolyzed diacylglycerol pyrophosphate (diacylglycerol-P-P) and was purified to homogeneity on the basis of this activity (19Wu W.-I. Liu Y. Riedel B. Wissing J.B. Fischl A.S. Carman G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1868-1876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). This enzyme proved to be one of the identified yeast homologs (YDR284C) and has been designated diacylglycerol-pyrophosphate phosphatase, Dpp1p. Although identified as a pyrophosphatase, Dpp1p can further metabolize the PA formed to diacylglycerol, albeit with lower catalytic efficiency (19Wu W.-I. Liu Y. Riedel B. Wissing J.B. Fischl A.S. Carman G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1868-1876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Dpp1p, along with other enzymes that hydrolyze diacylglycerol-P-P, act on a variety of lipid monophosphates including lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), ceramide phosphate, sphingosine 1-phosphate, and phosphatidylglycerol phosphate (19Wu W.-I.

The second homolog from yeast (lipid phosphate phosphatase,LPP1, YDR503c), also has broad specificity as demonstrated by hydrolysis of PA, LPA, and diacylglycerol-P-P (15Toke D.A. Bennett W.L.

A type II PA phosphatase from rat liver was similar in its ability to hydrolyze many different phosphorylated lipid substrates including those listed for Dpp1p (21Dillon D.A. Chen X. Zeimetz G.M.

Further evidence indicated that this mammalian activity could hydrolyze dolichyl-P (23Waggoner D.W. Gómez-Muñoz A. Dewald J. Brindley D.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16506-16509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The existence of a relatively non-selective lipid phosphatase was also suggested by observations that Mg2+-independent dolichyl-P phosphatase activities from mammalian sources were inhibited by PA and LPA (24Belocopitow E. Boscoboinik D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1982; 125: 167-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 25Rip J.W. Rupar C.A. Chaudhary N. Carroll K.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 1929-1934Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, a dolichyl-P phosphatase that was purified to apparent homogeneity from the particulate fraction of porcine brain used both dolichyl-P and PA with similar catalytic efficiency (26Frank D.W. Waechter C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11791-11796Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). This evidence and the knowledge that the yeast enzymes use multiple substrates suggested that DPP1 and/or LPP1 may catalyze hydrolysis of phosphorylated and pyrophosphorylated isoprenoids. Here, evidence for such activities and their virtual absence after disruption of LPP1 and DPP1 is presented and discussed. All chemicals were reagent grade. Radiochemicals, unless noted, and EN3HANCE were from NEN Life Science Products. Triton X-100, isopentyl alcohol, isopentyl pyrophosphate, farnesol, farnesyl pyrophosphate, geraniol, geranyl pyrophosphate, geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate, and bovine serum albumin were purchased from Sigma. Other reagents were obtained from the sources indicated: Silica Gel 60 thin layer chromatography plates (EM Science), Silica Gel-loaded SG81 chromatography paper (Whatman, Inc.), [3H]farnesyl pyrophosphate (60 mCi/mmol), and [3H]geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (American Radiolabeled Chemicals, Inc.), Tran35S-label (ICN Biochemicals), Zymolase 100-T (Seikagaku Kogyo Co.), Glusulase (DuPont), and oligonucleotide primers (Genosys). Molecular biology reagents were from New England Biolabs unless otherwise noted. Protein concentration was determined by described methods (27Bradford M.M. Anal.

S. cerevisiae were propagated in yeast extract/peptone/dextrose (YPD) or yeast nitrogen broth (YNB) supplemented with amino acids as required. Mating, sporulation, and other standard techniques used established methods (29Sherman F. Fink G.R. Lawrence L.W. Methods in Yeast Genetics: A Laboratory Manual.

Sakane F. Kanoh H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18931-18938Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), corresponding to yeast open reading frames YDR503C and YDR284C, were found by searching the Stanford University Saccharomyces Genome Data base. 2Stanford University Saccharomyces Genome Data base address: http://genome-www.stanford.edu/Saccharomyces/. During the course of this study, these genes became known as LPP1 andDPP1, respectively (15Toke D.A. Bennett W.L. Oshiro J. Wu W.-I. Voelker D.R. Carman G.M. J. Biol.

LPP1 and DPP1 were amplified with total genomic DNA from yeast strain SEY6210 using VentR® DNA Polymerase (New England Biolabs), supplied buffers, and 5% Me2SO. Oligonucleotide primers for LPP1 (YDR503C) (5′GTTAGGATCCGTCTGTTATCGTGGCTATTGCTCTA3′ and 5′CGCGGAATTCGATCAGGTAAGCTATGCATAATGTC3′) contained BamHI andEcoRI sites for insertion into the Bluescript SK+ vector (pBSK(+), Stratagene). Primers used to amplify DPP1(YDR284C) (5′TTAAGAGCTCGGGAATAAACTGTTATCTAGGGTCC3′ and 5′TACGCTGCAGAAAGTGATGTTGGGATTGTCCGATG3′) containedSacI and PstI sites for insertion into pBSK(+). Amplified products were verified by sequencing. The LPP1 ORF in pBSK(+) was cut with AvrII and filled by treatment with Klenow fragment. The kanMX module (33Wach A. Brachat A. Pohlmann R. Philippsen P. Yeast. 1994; 10: 1793-1808Crossref PubMed Scopus (2241) Google Scholar), encoding theNEO r gene, was inserted. The DPP1 ORF in pBSK was digested with BbsI and BamHI to remove the coding sequence for amino acids 73–275. After treatment with Klenow fragment, a HIS3 gene (imidazole-glycerol phosphate dehydratase) and promoter were inserted. A plasmid containing the HIS3 gene and promoter was a gift of Hiroko Hama (Utah State University). The construct for LPP1::Neodisruption was excised from pBSK with BamHI andEcoRI, whereas the construct forDPP1::HIS3 disruption was amplified from pBSK using the primers described above. These DNA fragments were used to transform yeast with the LiAc method (34Ito H. Fukada Y. Murata K. Kimura A. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 153: 163-168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); colonies were selected on the appropriate media, and total genomic DNA was isolated for analysis. Oligonucleotide primers outside of the recombination sites were used for amplification of the recombination locus by polymerase chain reaction with Taq® DNA Polymerase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), and the products were analyzed for predicted digestion patterns. Double disruptions were created by performing the disruption of DPP1 in yeast containing a confirmed LPP1disruption. Yeast cells were grown in YPD to anA 600 of approximately 1.0, and spheroplasts were formed by treatment at 30 °C with Zymolase (1 μg/A). All subsequent steps were performed at 4 °C. The spheroplasts were disrupted with glass beads (0.15–0.25 mm diameter) by vigorous mixing in a buffer consisting of 10 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. Beads and unbroken cells were sedimented by centrifugation for 5 min at 500 × g. The homogenate was separated by centrifugation for 60 min at 100,000 × g into supernatant (cytosol) and particulate fractions. The particulate fraction was resuspended in the same buffer by homogenization with a 22-gauge needle and syringe. Fractions were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −70 °C. Dpp1p (diacylglycerol-P-P phosphatase) was purified from wild-type S. cerevisiae as described by Wu et al. (19Wu W.-I. Liu Y. Riedel B. Wissing J.B. Fischl A.S. Carman G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1868-1876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). [32P]PA was synthesized from diolene and [γ-32P]ATP using diacylglycerol kinase from Escherichia coli (35Martin A. Gómez-Muñoz A. Jamal Z. Brindley D.N. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 197: 553-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). [32P]Dolichyl-P was synthesized chemically (36Scher M.G. Sumbilla C.M. Waechter C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 13742-13746Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). [β-32P]Dolichyl-P-P and unlabeled dolichyl-P-P were prepared by chemical synthesis from dolichyl-P (37Scher M.G. Waechter C.J. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 111: 547-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Diacylglycerol-P-P and [β-32P]diacylglycerol-P-P were synthesized enzymatically using purified Catharanthus roseusphosphatidate kinase as described (19Wu W.-I. Liu Y. Riedel B. Wissing J.B. Fischl A.S. Carman G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1868-1876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). PA phosphatase activity was measured using micelles formed by sonication of a mixture containing 500 μm dioleoyl-PA, [32P]dioleoyl-PA (1000–2000 cpm/nmol), and 0.5% Triton X-100. Reactions were performed for 30 min at 30 °C in 50 μl of 100 mm MES (pH 6.5), 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, and 1 mmdithiothreitol. Assays were stopped with 200 μl of 10% trichloroacetic acid and 100 μl of 1% bovine serum albumen, mixed vigorously, and spun for 10 min at 4500 × g (Beckman J-6). An aliquot (290 μl) of the resulting supernatant was removed and analyzed for released inorganic phosphate by liquid scintillation counting. This assay was modified from a previous description (35Martin A. Gómez-Muñoz A. Jamal Z. Brindley D.N. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 197: 553-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar,38Morlock K.R. Lin Y.-P. Carman G.M. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 3561-3566Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Dolichyl-P phosphatase activity was measured basically as described (39Sumbilla C. Waechter C.J. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 111: 471-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). A mixture of unlabeled dolichyl-P (500 μm) and dolichyl-[32P]P (50 cpm/pmol) was dispersed by ultrasonication in 1% Triton X-100. This substrate was mixed with the source of enzyme activity in buffer A (50 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.4), 3 mm EDTA) to a total volume of 50 μl. The final concentration of substrate was 50 μm dolichyl-P and 0.1% Triton X-100. After incubation for 30 min at 30 °C, reactions were stopped by extraction with organic solvent (39Sumbilla C. Waechter C.J. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 111: 471-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) or with trichloroacetic acid and bovine serum albumin as described for the assay of PA phosphatase. Released phosphate was determined by liquid scintillation counting. Dolichyl-P-P phosphatase activity was measured as described (37Scher M.G. Waechter C.J. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 111: 547-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar), but with the following modifications. Dolichyl-P-P (100 μm) and [β-32P]dolichyl-P-P (approximately 200 cpm/pmol) were dispersed by sonication with 1% Triton X-100. Reactions were performed in 50 μl of buffer A with 10 μm[β-32P]dolichyl-P-P in 0.1% Triton X-100. After incubation at 30 °C for 10 min, assays were terminated and analyzed for inorganic phosphate as described above. Farnesyl pyrophosphate (farnesyl-P-P) and geranylgeranyl-P-P phosphatase activities were measured as follows. Enzymatic reactions (20 μl) contained buffer A, the source of activity, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 0.4 μmol of either [3H]farnesyl-P-P (500 cpm/pmol) or [3H]geranylgeranyl-P-P (500 cpm/pmol). Lipids were initially dispersed in 1% Triton X-100 by sonication. Following incubation for 5 min at 30 °C, enzymatic reactions were stopped by the addition of 80 μl of methanol. Insoluble material was sedimented by centrifugation. The supernatant was removed, dried under a stream of nitrogen gas, dissolved in 20 μl of water-saturated butanol, and chromatographed on Silica Gel G60 thin layer plates using a mobile phase consisting of isopropyl alcohol/NH4OH/water (6:3:1). Appropriate standards were co-chromatographed for identification of substrate and products. Developed plates were air-dried and scanned for radioactivity using a Bioscan Imaging System 200-IBM. Hydrolysis of diacylglycerol-P-P by purified Dpp1p was measured by following the release of water-soluble [32P]phosphate from chloroform-soluble [β-32P]diacylglycerol-P-P (10,000 cpm/nmol) as described (19Wu W.-I. Liu Y. Riedel B. Wissing J.B. Fischl A.S. Carman G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1868-1876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The reaction mixture contained 50 mm sodium citrate (pH 5.0), 0.1 mmdiacylglycerol-P-P, 2 mm Triton X-100, 10 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, and enzyme in a total volume of 0.1 ml. Hydrolysis of geranylgeranyl-P-P was measured by monitoring the formation of [3H]geranylgeranyl-P from [3H]geranylgeranyl-P-P (40,000 cpm/nmol). The reaction mixture contained 50 mm sodium citrate buffer (pH 5.0), 0.1 mm geranylgeranyl-P-P, 2 mm Triton X-100, and enzyme in a total volume of 0.1 ml. The product, geranylgeranyl-P, was separated from geranylgeranyl-P-P by paper chromatography using Na2EDTA-treated SG81 paper (40Steiner S. Lester R.L. J. Bacteriol. 1972; 109: 81-88Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and development with chloroform/methanol/ammonium hydroxide/water (65:35:4:4). The positions of the labeled lipids on chromatograms were determined by fluorography using EN3HANCE and compared with standards. The amount of each labeled lipid was determined by liquid scintillation counting. All enzyme assays were conducted in triplicate for 20 min at 30 °C. The average standard deviation of the assays was ±5%. The enzyme reactions were linear with time and protein concentration. A unit of enzymatic activity was defined as the amount of enzyme that catalyzed the formation of 1 μmol of product/min unless otherwise indicated. Mannosylphosphoryldolichol synthase (Man-P-Dol synthase) activity was assayed, and initial rates were determined as described previously (41Waechter C.J. Scher M.G. Marks N. Rodnight R. Research Methods in Neurochemistry. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1981: 201-231Crossref Google Scholar). Two putative yeast proteins (YDR503c and YDR284c) with 49% similarity at the amino acid level to the published sequence for a mouse Mg2+-independent PA phosphatase (14Kai M. Wada I. Imai S. Sakane F.

During the course of this study, these genes were termed LPP1 (lipid phosphate phosphatase) andDPP1 (diacylglycerol-pyrophosphate phosphatase), respectively (15Toke D.A. Bennett W.L. Oshiro J.

The amino acid sequences of LPP1 andDPP1 are 51% similar and 26% identical to each other. The proteins encoded by these three genes share a common hydropathy plot (14Kai M. Wada I. Imai S. Sakane F.

They belong to a broader family of eukaryotic and prokaryotic proteins, which share significant amino acid identity in three distinct regions, and are all thought to be acid phosphatases that use phosphorylated lipids and/or carbohydrates as substrates (16Stukey J.

This was done in both MATa (SEY6211) and MATα(SEY6210) strains (52Johnson L.M. Bankaitis V.A. Emr S.D. Cell. 1987; 48: 875-885Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar) as listed in TableI. Cells with either single or double disruptions were viable, and their growth patterns were indistinguishable from wild-type cells on rich (YPD) media. Furthermore, various minimal media, different carbon sources, varying osmolality, and ranges of temperatures (16–40 °C) produced no differential effects on growth. Haploid SEY6211 lpp1Δ dpp1Δ (MATa) and SEY6210 lpp1Δ dpp1Δ (MATα) were able to mate with one another; the resulting SEY6211/SEY6210 lpp1Δ/lpp1Δ dpp1Δ/dpp1Δ diploid cells were able to sporulate, and all haploid offspring were viable. These results are consistent with previous reports (15Toke D.A. Bennett W.L. Oshiro J. Wu W.-I. Voelker D.R. Carman G.M. J. Biol.

The movement of carboxypeptidase Y through the secretory pathway was unaltered in lpp1Δ dpp1Δmutant cells when compared with wild-type cells (data not shown). In addition, correct glycosylation of carboxypeptidase Y indicated that the general glycosylation machinery was intact in cells lacking Lpp1p and Dpp1p.

Pap1 was localized normally in the cytoplasm but was accumulated in the nucleus when Crm1 was inactivated by a temperature-sensitive mutation or by treatment with leptomycin B, a specific export inhibitor. Deletion of the C-terminal cysteine-rich domain (CRD) resulted in nuclear accumulation of Pap1, while a glutathione S-transferase-green fluorescent protein-CRD fusion protein was localized in the cytoplasm in a Crm1-dependent manner. Deletion and mutational analyses identified several important amino acids in a 19-amino acid region in the CRD as a nuclear export signal (NES). Strikingly, a cysteine residue (Cys-532), in addition to two leucines and an isoleucine, was important for the NES function and the presence of at least one of the two cysteine residues was essential. Unlike classical NESs such as the human immunodeficiency virus Rev NES, the Pap1 NES lost the function upon treatment with oxidants such as diethyl maleate. The oxidative stress response is conserved through evolution, as green fluorescent protein-fused proteins bearing the Pap1 NES expressed in mammalian cells responded to diethyl maleate. These results show that the hydrophobic amino acid-rich region containing two important cysteines in Pap1 serves as a novel NES, which is sensitive to oxidative stress.

Recently, CRM1/exportin 1 was shown to be a receptor for the NES in both lower and higher eukaryotes (6Stade K. Ford C.S. Guthrie C. Weis K.

CRM1/exportin 1 shares low but distinct homology with importin β that recruits the complex of importin α and the nuclear localization signal (NLS)-containing proteins to the nuclear pore complex (NPC) by directly interacting with the NPC (10Görlich D.

Genetic alterations in the CRM1 locus caused a defect in nuclear export of NES-bearing proteins in yeast (6Stade K. Ford C.S. Guthrie C. Weis K.

Nuclear microinjection of a specific antibody to CRM1 that prevents thein vitro NES binding inhibited in vivo protein nuclear export in mammalian cells (13Kudo N. Wolff B. Sekimoto T. Schreiner E.P. Yoneda Y. Yanagida M. Horinouchi S. Yoshida M. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 242: 540-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (700) Google Scholar). Thus, the NES-mediated nuclear export of proteins is a universal and conserved mechanism by which subcellular localization of proteins is controlled in cells. CRM1/exportin 1 was originally identified as an essential protein controlling chromosome structure in fission yeastSchizosaccharomyces pombe (14Adachi Y. Yanagida M. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 1195-1207Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Temperature- or cold-sensitive mutations of S. pombe Crm1 caused abnormal chromosome morphology and other pleiotropic phenotypes such as resistance to several structurally unrelated antifungal agents and overproduction of p25Apt1, a functionally unknown flavoprotein. At least some of these phenotypes are mediated by activation of Pap1, an S. pombe bZip (basic leucine-zipper) DNA binding motif-containing protein that has homology with and binding specificity similar to the mammalian c-Jun, a component of the AP-1 transcription factor (15Toda T. Shimanuki M. Yanagida M. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 60-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). Pap1 is involved in oxidative stress response, heavy metal detoxication, and multidrug resistance. It controls the expression of the following stress-induced genes:ctt1 + for catalase (16Nakagawa C.W. Mutoh N. Hayashi Y. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1995; 118: 109-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar),trx2 + for thioredoxin (17Toone W.M. Kuge S. Samuels M. Morgan B.A. Toda T. Jones N.

Microbiol. 1992; 6: 761-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Chromosomal deletion ofpap1 + resulted in increased sensitivity to a variety of toxic compounds and loss of p25Apt1 production (23Toda T. Shimanuki M. Saka Y. Yamano H. Adachi Y. Shirakawa M.

We previously showed that a mutation of S. pombe crm1 + conferred resistance to leptomycin B (LMB) (25Nishi K. Yoshida M. Fujiwara D. Nishikawa M. Horinouchi S. Beppu T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6320-6324Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which had been discovered as a potent antifungal antibiotic blocking the eukaryotic cell cycle (26Hamamoto T. Gunji S. Tsuji H. Beppu T. J. Antibiot. 1983; 36: 639-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 27Yoshida M. Nishikawa M. Nishi K. Abe K. Horinouchi S. Beppu T. Exp. Cell Res. 1990; 187: 150-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). We proposed that S. pombe Crm1 is the cellular target of LMB, which was evidenced by the identical phenotypes between crm1 mutant cells and LMB-treated wild-type cells (25Nishi K. Yoshida M. Fujiwara D. Nishikawa M. Horinouchi S. Beppu T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6320-6324Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, Wolff et al. (28Wolff B. Sanglier J.-J. Wang Y. Chem. Biol. 1997; 4: 139-147Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar) rediscovered LMB as an agent that inhibits the nuclear export of HIV-1 Rev. We and others found that LMB abolishes association of CRM1/exportin 1 with the NES by directly binding to CRM1/exportin 1, thereby inhibiting nuclear export of proteins (7Fornerod M. Ohno M. Yoshida M. Mattaj I.W. Cell. 1997; 90: 1051-1060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1724) Google Scholar, 8Fukuda M. Asano S. Nakamura T. Adachi M. Yoshida M. Yanagida M. Nishida E.

These results, together with the finding that LMB causes p25Apt1overproduction (25Nishi K. Yoshida M. Fujiwara D. Nishikawa M. Horinouchi S. Beppu T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6320-6324Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), raise a possibility that CRM1/exportin 1 negatively regulates Pap1 activity by exporting it from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. Budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae contains two AP-1 homologs, Yap1 and Yap2 (29Moye-Rowley W.S. Harshman K.D. Parker C.S. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 283-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 30Schnell N. Krems B. Entian K.D. Curr. Genet. 1992; 21: 269-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 31Bossier P.

Yap1 acts as a major transcription factor that induces expression of various genes required for stress response or drug resistance in response to oxidative stress generated by hydrogen peroxide, diamide, and diethyl maleate (DEM) (34Wu A. Wemmie J.A. Edgington N.P. Goebl M. Guevara J.L. Moye-Rowley W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18850-18858Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 35Kuge S. Jones N.

Parker C.S. Moye-Rowley W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14690-14697Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The Yap2 function may be redundant to that of Yap1 at least in some response pathways, although YAP2 deletion had no effect on some of the Yap1 target genes (31Bossier P. Fernandes L. Rocha D. Rodrigues-Pousada C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23640-23645Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Hirata D. Yano K. Miyakawa T. Mol. Gen.

Chem. 1993; 268: 18850-18858Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These transcription factors show significant homology with Pap1 in the two distinct regions, the bZip domain and the C-terminal cysteine-rich domain (CRD) (15Toda T. Shimanuki M. Yanagida M. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 60-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). Recently, Kuge et al. (38Kuge S. Jones N. Nomoto A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1710-1720Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar, 39Kuge S. Toda T. Iizuka N. Nomoto A. Genes Cells. 1998; 3: 521-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) showed that the Yap1 CRD was responsible for the CRM1/exportin 1-dependent cytoplasmic localization of Yap1, which may be important for sensing the redox state of the cell. These observations led us to assume that the Pap1 CRD also regulates the subcellular localization in response to oxidative stress. Most recently, Toone et al. (17Toone W.M. Kuge S. Samuels M. Morgan B.A. Toda T. Jones N. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1453-1463Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar) reported that Pap1 relocalizes from the cytoplasm to the nucleus in a process that is dependent on Sty1, a fission yeast stress-activated MAP kinase (40Shiozaki K. Russell P. Nature. 1995; 378: 739-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar, 41Millar J.B. Buck V. Wilkinson M.G. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2117-2130Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar, 42Kato T. Okazaki K. Murakami H. Stettler P. Fantes P. Okayama H. FEBS Lett. 1996; 378: 207-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). This relocalization appears to result from regulated protein export by CRM1/exportin 1 and a Ran nucleotide exchange factor. In this report, we demonstrate that the CRD of Pap1 contains an NES. Interestingly, the Pap1 NES, an atypical NES consisting of a leucine-rich sequence with an important cysteine residue, is functional in not only yeast but also animal cells and is sensitive to oxidative stress. The novel NES of Pap1 highlights a mechanism of stress response in eukaryotes. S. pombestrains used in this study were 972 (h −), JY266 (h + leu1–32), TP17–13C (h − leu1–32 crm1–1R), and TP108–3C (h − leu1–32 ura4 pap1::ura4 +). The S. pombe strains were grown in complete YPD medium (1% yeast extract, 2% polypeptone, and 2% glucose) or minimal medium (43Alfa C. Fantes P. Hyams J. McLeod M. Warbrick E. Experiments with Fission Yeast: a Laboratory Course Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1993: 133-136Google Scholar), which was used for plasmid selection and induction of thenmt1 promoters. For suppression of the nmt1promoters of pREP plasmids, thiamine hydrochloride was added to minimal medium at the final concentration of 50 μg/ml. LMB was prepared as described (26Hamamoto T. Gunji S. Tsuji H. Beppu T. J. Antibiot. 1983; 36: 639-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Diethyl maleate was purchased from Sigma. pREP1, pREP41, and pREP81 were used for controlled expression of various proteins in S. pombecells. pREP1 contains the wild-type nmt1 promoter, which can strongly direct transcription when thiamine is absent in the medium (44Maundrell K. Gene (Amst.). 1993; 123: 127-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (923) Google Scholar). pREP41 and pREP81 possess mutations in their promoter sequences, which result in the moderate and weak promoter activities, respectively (45Basi G. Schmid E. Maundrell K. Gene (Amst.). 1993; 123: 131-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar). Plasmids for expressing various GFP-fused proteins in S. pombe were constructed on the basis of pR1GF1 (13Kudo N. Wolff B. Sekimoto T. Schreiner E.P. Yoneda Y. Yanagida M. Horinouchi S. Yoshida M. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 242: 540-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (700) Google Scholar) and pR1F1. A DNA fragment encoding EGFP ORF was amplified by PCR using synthetic oligonucleotides (5′-GGCAGATCTCTCATATGGCTAGCATGGTGAGCAAGGGCGAGGAG-3′ and 5′-GCCCCCGGGTCAATCTCGAGGGATCCCCTTGTACAGCTCGTCCATGCC-3′) as the primers and pEGFP-N1 (CLONTECH) as a template. pR1F1 was constructed by inserting the fragment between NdeI andSmaI sites on pREP1. pR1FPA1 and pR1FPA2 for GFP fused with full-length Pap1 and CRD-deleted Pap1 (represented as ΔCRD, residues 1–483), respectively, were constructed by inserting the PCR-amplified fragments obtained using pST1 (15Toda T. Shimanuki M. Yanagida M. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 60-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar) as a template into theBamHI-XhoI site on pR1F1, resulting in the connection at the 3′-end of EGFP ORF. Synthetic oligonucleotides used for pR1FPA1 were 5′-CGGCTCGAGGGGATCCAGATGTCCGGACAAACTGAGACGTTG-3′ (pap1–1) and 5′-CGGCTCGAGCCCGGGTCAGCTAGCACATCGTCTTTCATCGAGTAATAC-3′ (pap1-a) whereas those for pR1FPA2 were pap1–1 and 5′-CGGCTCGAGCCCGGGTCAGCTAGCTTGAGAACTAGTATCATGTTTACC-3′ (pap1-b). In pR1FPA1, pR1FPA2, and pR1GFPA4 (below), an NheI site was created at the end of the coding sequences, resulting in the addition of residues of an alanine and a serine at the C-terminal ends of the fusion proteins. To construct pR1GFPA4, -5, and -6 for the expression of GST-GFP fused with the CRD and its subdomains, we inserted fragments amplified by PCR into theBamHI-XhoI site on pR1GF1. The primers used were 5′-CCTGGATCCCTAATGAAATCGTTCCGGCCAAGGAACG-3′ (pap1–3) and pap1-a for pR1GFPA4; pap1–3 and 5′-CCGCTCGAGTCAATCATCAATGTCGAAACTCTC-3′ (pap1-k) for pR1GFPA5 and 5′-CCTGGATCCCTGCATACCTCAGCTGCCCCAAGG-3′ (pap1–10) and 5′-CCGCTCGAGTCATACACCCGAAGAAGAACATTTAGC-3′ (pap1-j) for pR1GFPA6. pR1GFPA7, -8, -9, -10, and -11 were constructed by inserting DNA fragments composed of annealed synthetic oligonucleotides into the same site on pR1GF1. Oligonucleotides used were 5′-GATCCCTTCAAAGATTATCAATCACCCTCGATTTGAGAGTTTC-3′ (pap1–8), 5′-GACATTGATGATTTGTGTAGCAAGTTGAAGAATTGAC-3′ (pap1–9), 5′-CGAGTCAATTCTTCAACTTGCTACA-3′ (pap1-g), 5′-CAAATCATCAATGTCGAAACTCTCAAATCG-3′ (pap1-h) and 5′-AGGGTGATTGATAATCTTTGAAGG-3′ (pap1-i) for pR1GFPA7; 5′-GATCCCTGAGAGTTTCGACATTGATGATTTGTGTAGCAAGTTGAAG-3′ (pap1–6), 5′-AATAAAGCTAAATGTTCTTCTTCGGGTGTATGAC-3′ (pap1–7), 5′-TCGAGTCATACACCCGAAGAAGA-3′ (pap1-d), 5′-ACATTTAGCTTTATTCTTCAACTTGCTACA-3′ (pap1-e) and 5′-CAAATCATCAATGTCGAAACTCTCAGG-3′ (pap1-f) for pR1GFPA8; 5′-GATCCCTGAGAGTTTCGACATTGATGATTTGTGTAGCAAGTTGAAGAATTGAC-3′ (pap1–4) and 5′-TCGAGTCAATTCTTCAACTTGCTACACAAATCATCAATGTCGAAACTCTCAGG-3′ (pap1-c) for pR1GFPA9; 5′-GATCCCTCACCCTCGATTTGAGAGTTTCGACATTGATGATTTGTGTAGC-3′ (pap1–11), 5′-AAGTTGAAGAATAAAGCTAAATGTTCTTGAC-3′ (pap1–12), 5′-TCGAGTCAAGAACATTTAGC-3′ (pap1-m), 5′-TTTATTCTTCAACTTGCTACACAAATCATC-3′ (pap1-n) and 5′-AATGTCGAAACTCTCAAATCGAGGGTGAGG-3′ (pap1-o) for pR1GFPA10 and 5′-GATCCCTGAGAGTTTCGACATTGATGATTTGTGTAGC-3′ (pap1–12), 5′-GATCCCTGAGAGTTTCGACATTGATGATTTGTGTAGC-3′ (pap1–13), pap1-m, pap1-n and 5′-AATGTCGAAACTCTCAGG-3′ (pap1-p) for pR1GFPA11. To construct the plasmids for expressing GST-GFP-fused PA11 with single or double mutation(s), the same strategy for constructing pR1GFPA11 was employed using pap1–12, pap1–13, pap1-m, pap1-n, and pap1-p containing base exchanges that cause amino acid substitutions. For creating mutations into alanine, serine, and leucine, the corresponding codons were exchanged by GCT, TCT, and TTA, respectively. The annealed synthetic DNA fragments encoding PA11 and its mutants were also inserted into the BamHI-XhoI site on pR1GsvNLSF1 (12Kudo N. Khochbin S. Nishi K. Kitano K. Yanagida M. Yoshida M. Horinouchi S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29742-29751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), for constructing the expression plasmids for GST-SV40 T-antigen NLS-GFP-fused PA11 and its derivatives. pR1GrevNESF1 for GST-Rev NES-GFP was described previously (12Kudo N. Khochbin S. Nishi K. Kitano K. Yanagida M. Yoshida M. Horinouchi S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29742-29751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). pR1FPA2NES1 for expressing GFP-fused CRD-deleted Pap1 containing the Rev NES was constructed by inserting annealed synthetic DNAs, 5′-CTAGCTTGCCTCCCTTAGAGCGTTTAACTCTAGACTGCTGAC-3′ and 5′-TCGAGTCAGCAGTCTAGAGTTAAACGCTCTAAGGGAGGCAAG-3′, into theNheI-XhoI site of pR1FPA2. To express Pap1 or CRD-deleted Pap1 (ΔCRD)without GFP in S. pombe, we constructed pR1PA1, pR41PA1, pR81PA1, pR1PA2, pR41PA2, and pR81PA2 by inserting the DNA fragments corresponding to Pap1 ORF excised from pR1FPA1 and pR1FPA2 into the BamHI-SmaI site of pREP1, pREP41, and pREP81, respectively. pE16GPA4F1 for expressing GST-CRD-GFP by T7 promoter in Escherichia coli was constructed as follows: Multiple cloning sites were created betweenNdeI and BamHI sites of pET16b (Novagen) using annealed synthetic DNAs (5′-TATCGAGCTCCATATGGGGATCCAGACTAGTGCTCGAGCCCGGGTGACTGACTGAC-3′ and 5′-GATCGTCAGTCAGTCACCCGGGCTCGAGCACTAGTCTGGATCCCCATATGGAGCTCGA-3′). DNA fragments encoding GST and GFP amplified by PCR using pGEX-5X (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as the template and primers (5′-GGCGAGCTCATGTCCCCTATACTAGGTTATTGG-3′ and 5′-GCCCCATATGACGACCTTCGATCAGATCCGATTT-3′) for GST, and pS65T (CLONTECH) as the template and primers (5′-GCGCTCGAGCCCGGGATATGGGTAAAGGAGAAGAACTTTTC-3′ and 5′-CTACTTGTATAGTTCATCCATGCCATG-3′) for GFP were inserted into theSacI-NdeI and XhoI-SmaI sites, respectively. The plasmid thus obtained was digested byBamHI and SpeI and ligated with the DNA fragment encoding CRD obtained from digestion of pR1FPA4 by BamHI andNheI, resulting in the construction of pE16GPA4F1. The mammalian expression plasmids for various GFP-fused proteins were constructed as follows. We inserted the NheI-XhoI fragments excised from pR1FPA1, pR1FPA2, pR1GFPA4, and pR1GFPA11 into the NheI-XhoI site of pEGFP-C1 (CLONTECH) to construct pFPA1 for GFP-Pap1, pFPA2 for GFP-ΔCRD, pFPA4 for GFP-CRD, and pFPA11 for GFP-PA11. pFRevNES1 for GFP-Rev NES was constructed by inserting the annealed synthetic DNAs (5′-TCGAGGCTTGCCTCCCTTAGAGCGTTTAACTCTAGACTGCTGAG-3′ and 5′-GATCCTCAGCAGTCTAGAGTTAAACGCTCTAAGGGAGGCAAGCC-3′) into theXhoI-BamHI site of pEGFP-C1. Nucleotide sequences of all the cloned DNA fragments mediated by PCR and by annealing of synthetic DNAs were confirmed. Various plasmids for expression of GFP-fused proteins were introduced into S. pombe TP108–3C (pap1 − strain) or TP17–13C (crm1 ts strain). The fused proteins were expressed by cultivating the transformants in the absence of thiamine for about 12–15 h at 30 °C (pap1 −) or 26.5 °C (crm1 ts), and then subcellular distributions of the proteins were observed under a Zeiss Axiophot-2 fluorescent microscope. The effects of LMB and DEM were analyzed by adding the drugs to the above cultures at a final concentration of 50 ng/ml for LMB and 2 mm for DEM, respectively, and cultivating for an additional 0.5–6 h. Periods for drug treatment depended on the proteins, since the proteins containing potential NLS such as the full-length Pap1 or the ΔCRD fusion rapidly relocalized into the nucleus (0.5 h for LMB and 1 h for DEM), while other proteins without NLS showed relatively slow nuclear translocation (3 h for LMB and 4–6 h for DEM), probably due to the passive diffusion. To see the effect of the crm1 mutation, we kept the above culture of crm1 ts at a restrictive temperature (37 °C) for 2–6 h. Location of the nucleus was determined by staining the cells with DAPI. A human carcinoma cell line (HeLa) and a murine fibroblast cell line (NIH3T3) were cultured at 37 °C under a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. GST-CRD-GFP fusion protein was expressed inE. coli BL21 (DE3) harboring pE16GPA4F1 and purified by glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). HeLa cells grown on glass coverslips were pretreated with or without 10 ng/ml LMB for 1.5 h, and were then injected with the purified GST-CRD-GFP protein using a Micromanipulator 5171 and a Transjector 5246 (Eppendorf) with glass capillary needles under a Zeiss Axiovert 135 microscope. Successful injection was monitored by co-injection with tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate (TRITC)-labeled dextran (M r 70,000, Molecular Probes). After microinjection, the cells were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C or 4 °C, and then fixed with 3.7% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 10 min. Fluorescence of GFP and TRITC was observed under a Zeiss Axiophot-2 fluorescent microscope. Transfection of NIH3T3 cells with pFPA1 for expression of GFP-fused Pap1, pFPA2 for GFP-ΔCRD, pFPA4 for GFP-CRD, pFPA11 for GFP-PA11, and pFRevNES1 for GFP-Rev NES was performed with LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the furnished instructions. The cellular distribution of GFP-fused proteins was observed under a Zeiss Axiovert 135 fluorescent microscope. S. pombe TP108–3C (pap1 −) was transformed with pR1PA1, pR41PA1, and pR81PA1 for expression of full-length Pap1 or pR1PA2, pR41PA2, and pR81PA2 for CRD-deleted Pap1 (ΔCRD). For empty vector control, pREP1 was used. The transformants were cultured overnight at 30 °C in minimal medium supplemented with 50 μg/ml thiamine and transferred to the medium without thiamine for expression from thenmt1 and its derivative promoters. After cultivation for 14 h at 30 °C, cells grown exponentially were cultured for an additional 2 h in the presence or absence of 50 ng/ml LMB. For identification of the stimuli that activate Pap1-dependent gene expression, exponentially growing S. pombe 972 (wild-type) cells cultured for 10 h in minimal medium were subjected to the following stress conditions for 6 h: 2 mm DEM, 2 mm hydrogen peroxide, 0.4 mm menadione, 1.5 mm diamide, 2 μg/ml staurosporine, 50 μg/ml cycloheximide, 5 μg/ml brefeldin A, 10 mm caffeine, 0.5 m KCl, and 50 ng/ml LMB. These cells were harvested, and whole cell extracts were prepared as follows. The cells (about 30 μl wet volume) were freeze-thawed, suspended with 150 μl of extraction buffer (20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mmMgCl2, 50 mm KCl, 5% glycerol, 0.1% SDS, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.6 μg/ml pepstatin A), and disrupted with glass beads at 4 °C. Supernatants obtained by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C were used as whole cell extracts. The protein concentrations of the extracts were measured by Bradford's method. Proteins (0.5 μg of total protein) of the whole cell extracts were separated on a 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The blot was incubated overnight with a diluted (1:500) anti-p25Apt1 rabbit antiserum (23Toda T. Shimanuki M. Saka Y. Yamano H. Adachi Y. Shirakawa M. Kyogoku Y. Yanagida M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5474-5484Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) at 4 °C. p25Apt1 was detected with an ECL system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit Ig. Pap1 has significant homology with Yap1 and Yap2 in two distinct domains, bZip in the N-terminal region and the cysteine-rich domain (CRD) at the C terminus (Fig. 1A). The Yap1 CRD has been shown to be responsible for its cytoplasmic localization and autonomously negative regulation (38Kuge S. Jones N. Nomoto A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1710-1720Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar, 46Takeuchi T. Miyahara K. Hirata D. Miyakawa T. FEBS Lett. 1997; 416: 339-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). To test whether the Pap1 CRD (residues 488–544) is also important for its subcellular localization, we expressed three GFP fusion proteins, GFP-Pap1 (F-Pap1), GFP-Pap1 lacking the CRD (F-ΔCRD), and GST-GFP-CRD (G-F-CRD) incrm1 + cells in the absence of endogenous Pap1 (pap1 -). The full-length Pap1 localized in the cytoplasm (Fig. 1B) but was not detected in the nucleus. On the other hand, CRD-deleted Pap1 was observed as single spots that colocalized with DAPI-stained nuclei. GST-GFP-CRD was present in the cytoplasm, indicating that the CRD is sufficient for the Pap1 cytoplasmic localization. If the cytoplasmic localization is due to the presence of an NES but not a cytoplasmic retention signal, then LMB, a specific nuclear export inhibitor, would disrupt the cytoplasmic localization of Pap1. When the cells expressing GFP-Pap1 were exposed to 50 ng/ml LMB for 3 h, Pap1 relocalized to and accumulated in the nucleus (F-Pap1), although the nuclear"

We describe three different intramolecular binding interactions that may account for the process of dynamin self-assembly. The first binding interaction is the dimerization of a 100-amino acid segment in the C-terminal half of dynamin. We call this segment the assembly domain, because it appears to be critical for multimerization. The second binding interaction occurs between the assembly domain and the N-terminal GTPase domain. The strength of this interaction is controlled by the nucleotide-bound state of the GTPase domain, as shown with mutations in GTP binding motifs and in vitro binding experiments. The third binding interaction occurs between the assembly domain and a segment that we call the middle domain. This is the segment between the N-terminal GTPase domain and the pleckstrin homology domain. The three different binding interactions suggest a model in which dynamin molecules first dimerize. The dimers are then linked into a chain by a second binding reaction. The third binding interaction might connect adjacent rungs of the spiral.

The dimers are then linked into a chain by a second binding reaction. The third binding interaction might connect adjacent rungs of the spiral. The discovery that the Drosophila shibire gene encodes the homologue of dynamin led to the realization that these proteins are important for an early stage in endocytosis (1Chen M.S. Obar R.A.

Nature. 1991; 351: 411-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar). Functional assays with transfected mammalian cells demonstrated that dynamin is also required for clathrin-mediated endocytosis in mammals (3van der Bliek A.M. Redelmeier T.E. Damke H. Tisdale E.J. Meyerowitz E.M. Schmid S.L. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 553-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar). A possible mechanism was suggested by the discovery that dynamin forms a spiral at the neck of budding clathrin-coated vesicles when nerve endings are incubated with GTPγS 1The abbreviations used are: GTPγS, guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate; PRD, proline-rich domain; PH domain, pleckstrin homology domain; GST, glutathioneS-transferase; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. (a nonhydrolyzable GTP analog) (4Takei K. McPherson P.S. Schmid S.L. De Camilli P. Nature. 1995; 374: 186-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar). Purified dynamin also assembles into spirals or rings in the absence of membrane (5Hinshaw J.E. Schmid S.L. Nature. 1995; 374: 190-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar). These structures are strikingly similar to electron-dense collars that were observed many years earlier in neurons of Drosophila shibiremutants (6Kosaka T. Ikeda K. J. Neurobiol. 1983; 14: 207-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Recent experiments demonstrated the ability of brain cytosol and purified dynamin to form lipid tubules (7Takei K. Haucke V.

Cell. 1998; 93: 1021-1029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar) Purified dynamin can sever the lipid tubules by GTP-dependent constriction (8Sweitzer S.M. Hinshaw J.E. Cell. 1998; 93: 1021-1029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar). It is therefore likely that the dynamin spirals at the necks of budding vesicles catalyze the pinching-off of clathrin-coated vesicles. Dynamin is a member of a family of structurally related but functionally diverse GTP-binding proteins with large C-terminal extensions (9van der Bliek A.M. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 96-102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Three large blocks of sequences are highly conserved within the family of dynamin-related proteins. The N-terminal segment contains a GTPase domain, which is highly conserved between dynamin-related proteins, comprising a distinct subgroup within the GTPase superfamily. The second domain, which we call the middle domain, has no known function. The third domain is a putative coiled-coil, which we call the assembly domain, because it may play an important role in forming dynamin multimers. Most family members have divergent segments inserted between the middle and the assembly domains. The inserted segment in dynamin is a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, which binds to phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate and, therefore, may be important for interactions between dynamin and the plasma membrane (10Salim K. Bottomley M.J. Querfurth E. Zvelebil M.J. Gout I. Scaife R. Margolis R.L. Gigg R. Smith C.I. Driscoll P.C. Waterfield M.D. Panayotou G.

The inserted segments of the other family members are completely divergent from each other and from other proteins. This diversity in sequence may reflect the different functions performed by dynamin family members. Dynamin is the only member of the dynamin family with an additional C-terminal extension, which was called the proline-rich domain (PRD) because it has more than 30% proline residues. The PRD interacts with microtubules or SH3 domains in vitro, thereby stimulating the dynamin GTPase (12Shpetner H.S. Vallee R.B. Nature. 1992; 355: 733-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 13Gout I. Dhand R. Hiles I.D. Fry M.J. Panayotou G. Das P. Truong O. Totty N.F. Hsuan J. Booker G.W. Campbell I.D. Waterfield M.D. Cell. 1993; 75: 25-36Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). However, all the intermolecular binding interactions that are necessary for spiral formation are specified by dynamin sequences, because no other proteins are required for in vitro assembly of a dynamin spiral (5Hinshaw J.E. Schmid S.L. Nature. 1995; 374: 190-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar). C-terminal fragments help activate the N-terminal GTPases of dynamin (14Muhlberg A.B. Warnock D.E. Schmid S.L. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6676-6683Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar), but little else is known about the internal organization of the dynamin spiral. There may be as many as three steps in the formation of a dynamin spiral. 1) Cytosolic dynamin forms a tetramer, possibly by joining two dynamin dimers (14Muhlberg A.B. Warnock D.E. Schmid S.L. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6676-6683Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). 2) Dynamin oligomers are then linked into longer chains at the plasma membrane. (3van der Bliek A.M. Redelmeier T.E. Damke H. Tisdale E.J. Meyerowitz E.M. Schmid S.L. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 553-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar) Once the dynamin spiral has made a full circle, the rungs of the spiral might contact each other in a third binding interaction that would help facilitate constriction. Here we describe the discovery of a series of binding interactions between three domains of dynamin that are conserved within the dynamin family: the GTPase domain, the middle domain, and the assembly domain. These binding interactions suggest how dynamin might form a spiral and then constrict. DNA fragments encoding different parts of dynamin were generated by polymerase chain reaction withPfu polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) with oligonucleotides that have restriction sites at their 5′-ends. The GTPase domain was cloned into NdeI and SalI sites of the bait plasmid (pAS1-CYH2) and into BamHI andXhoI sites of the target plasmid (pAct-II) (15Durfee T. Becherer K. Chen P.L. Yeh S.H. Yang Y. Kilburn A.E. Lee W.H. Elledge S.J. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 555-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (1300) Google Scholar). Other fragments were cloned into NcoI and SalI sites of pAS1-CYH2 or into NcoI and XhoI sites of pAct. The positions of the fragments used in yeast 2-hybrid and in vitro binding studies are shown in Fig. 1. Where indicated, mutations were introduced by fusion polymerase chain reaction with complementary mutagenic oligonucleotides as described (3van der Bliek A.M. Redelmeier T.E. Damke H. Tisdale E.J. Meyerowitz E.M. Schmid S.L. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 553-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar). Polymerase chain reaction constructs were sequenced to rule out replication errors. The two hybrid constructs were transformed into the yeast strain Y190 (15Durfee T. Becherer K. Chen P.L. Yeh S.H. Yang Y. Kilburn A.E. Lee W.H. Elledge S.J. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 555-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (1300) Google Scholar) with polyethylene glycol/lithium acetate, as described (16Gietz D. St. Jean A. Woods R.A. Schiestl R.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (2899) Google Scholar). A yeast 2-hybrid library made from human brain cDNA (CLONTECH Laboratories, Palo Alto, CA) was screened by growing the transformed yeast on selective plates without leucine, tryptophan, or histidine but with 25 mm3-amino-1,2,4-triazole (15Durfee T. Becherer K. Chen P.L. Yeh S.H. Yang Y. Kilburn A.E. Lee W.H. Elledge S.J. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 555-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (1300) Google Scholar). Surviving colonies were tested with a filter assay for β-galactosidase activity (CLONTECH Laboratories). Protein fragments were expressed with baculovirus, which is known to give high yields of active dynamin (5Hinshaw J.E. Schmid S.L. Nature. 1995; 374: 190-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar, 17Warnock D.E. Hinshaw J.E. Schmid S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22310-22314Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). To this end, DNA fragments were cloned into pBlueBac4 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) with six histidines or GST-coding sequences added by polymerase chain reaction. Recombinant virus was produced in Sf9 cells as recommended by Invitrogen. Infected cells were harvested after 48 h, resuspended in lysis buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, 160 mm NaCl, 2 mmMgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mmdithiothreitol) with 0.1% Triton and protease inhibitors and lysed with a French pressure cell (American Instrument Co, Inc., Silver Spring, MD) adjusted to 20,000 psi. Recombinant proteins were bound to His-Bind resin (Novagen Inc., Madison, WI) or glutathione-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and eluted with 250 mmimidazole in lysis buffer without Triton or with 10 mmglutathione in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. The purified proteins were then dialyzed into lysis buffer and stored at −80 °C. GST fused to the yeast clathrin light chain protein was a gift from Diane Chu. To make radiolabeled protein for in vitro binding studies, cDNA fragments were recloned into pET vectors (Novagen). Proteins were synthesized with the TNT®T7 Coupled Transcription/Translation System (Promega Corp., Madison, WI) using [35S]methionine (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Where indicated, unlabeled methionine was added to 100 μm in the transcription/translation reactions, thereby increasing the amount of synthesized protein but decreasing the specific activity approximately 100-fold. In vitrobinding assays were conducted with 1 μg of unlabeled GST fusion protein and [35S]methionine-labeled target protein, or both proteins were labeled with [35S]methionine. The proteins were incubated in 250 μl of binding buffer (phosphate-buffered saline with 10 mm EDTA or phosphate-buffered saline with 5 mm MgCl2 and 100 μm GTP) and 20 μl glutathione-Sepharose beads and gently mixed at 4 °C for 1 h (18$$Google Scholar). The beads were then pelleted by centrifugation and washed in binding buffer. The bound proteins were eluted with 10 mm glutathione in 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, and fractionated by SDS-PAGE. The gels were dried and subjected to autoradiography or quantitated with a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). Cross-linking was essentially as described (19Fancy D.A. Melcher K. Johnston S.A. Kodadek T. Chem. Biol. (Lond.). 1996; 3: 551-559Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Briefly, 1 μg of His-tagged protein was incubated for 5 min in 20 μl of phosphate-buffered saline with 2 mm nickel acetate on ice. Where indicated, 3 μg of carbonic anhydrase (Sigma) was included as a control. Then magnesium monoperoxyphtalic acid was added to a final concentration of 1 mm, and the mixture was incubated for another 15 min on ice. The reactions were stopped with SDS sample buffer. SDS-PAGE gels were stained with Coomassie Blue and scanned with a Molecular Dynamics densitometer. We conducted a yeast 2-hybrid screen to identify human brain proteins that interact with a 377-amino acid fragment of dynamin containing the N-terminal GTPase domain. In a screen of 600,000 colonies transformed with human brain cDNA, we isolated 300 colonies that could grow without histidine, because they expressed thehis-3 reporter gene (15Durfee T. Becherer K. Chen P.L. Yeh S.H. Yang Y. Kilburn A.E. Lee W.H. Elledge S.J. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 555-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (1300) Google Scholar). Upon further analysis, only one of those transformants was found to require both bait and target plasmids to express a second reporter (β-galactosidase), suggesting that this colony contained a target protein that binds to the dynamin GTPase domain. The target plasmid isolated from this colony was sequenced and, much to our surprise, found to encode the C-terminal half of dynamin. The cDNA starts at amino acid position 545, which is in the dynamin PH domain, and then extends into the 3′-untranslated region (Fig. 1). This was a first indication that the dynamin GTPase domain binds to C-terminal sequences. The sequences within the C-terminal half that bind to the N-terminal GTPase domain were identified by testing short segments in the yeast 2-hybrid system. We found that those sequences were contained within a 100-amino acid segment, between the PH domain and the PRD (Fig. 2). This segment had previously been suggested to form a coiled coil (20Baba T. Damke H. Hinshaw J.E. Ikeda K. Schmid S.L. Warnock D.E. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1995; 60: 235-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), although the coiled coil-forming probability predicted by programs such as Coils is relatively weak (21Lupas A. Van Dyke M. Stock J. Science. 1991; 252: 1162-1164Crossref PubMed Scopus (3483) Google Scholar). Support for a role in dimerization comes from a comparison with the homologous segment in Mx proteins, which contains leucine zippers. To test whether the dynamin fragment dimerizes, we expressed this fragment both as bait and as target in the yeast 2-hybrid system. Dimerization was readily detectable with a 100-amino acid segment (Fig. 2) but not with shorter fragments (data not shown). We call this segment the assembly domain, because it binds to itself and to the GTPase domain, which suggests that it plays a central role in the assembly process. To characterize the newly discovered interactions between the GTPase domain and the assembly domain, we introduced mutations that are predicted to alter the GTP binding properties of the GTPase domain and tested their effects on binding between the GTPase domain and the assembly domain. Unfortunately, we were unable to utilize well characterized Ras-activating mutations, as was done previously with other GTP-binding proteins, because the dynamin GTPase domain is too dissimilar from Ras. We could, however, introduce mutations that are predicted to block guanine nucleotide binding (K44A and S45N). These two mutations cause the GTPase to bind much more strongly to the assembly domain in the yeast 2-hybrid system (Fig. 2). The effect of the K44A and S45N mutations indicates that the strength of the binding interaction is coupled to the cycling of GTP. Further experiments with the yeast 2 hybrid system showed that the assembly domain is capable of a third binding interaction besides binding to itself and to the GTPase domain. We found that the assembly domain also binds strongly to the sequences between the GTPase domain and the PH domain, which we call the middle domain (Fig. 3). Our results therefore suggest that the assembly domain has three binding interactions. It can dimerize (1Chen M.S. Obar R.A. Schroeder C.C. Austin T.W. Poodry C.A. Wadsworth S.C. Vallee R.B. Nature. 1991; 351: 583-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar), bind to the GTPase domain (2van der Bliek A.M. Meyerowitz E.M. Nature. 1991; 351: 411-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar), and bind to the middle domain (3van der Bliek A.M. Redelmeier T.E. Damke H. Tisdale E.J. Meyerowitz E.M. Schmid S.L. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 553-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar). These three binding interactions might be needed for dynamin to form a multimeric spiral. However, the number of binding interactions also raises the question of whether these interactions are specific or instead are because of nonspecific “stickiness” of the assembly domain. With the GTPase domain, this issue was addressed by testing point mutations known to affect GTP binding (Fig. 2). With the middle domain, it was not obvious which mutations to test, because nothing else is known about the middle domain. To investigate the specificity of binding between the middle domain and the assembly domain, we determined whether homologous domains from another dynamin family member could replace them. As a counterpart, we chose Mx1, which is one of the mammalian Mx proteins known to inhibit viral replication. In yeast 2-hybrid experiments, we found that the dynamin middle domain did not bind to the Mx1 assembly domain, nor did the Mx1 middle domain bind to the dynamin assembly domain (Fig. 3). However, the Mx1 middle domain did bind to the Mx1 assembly domain, similar to the dynamin-dynamin interactions described above. This result demonstrates that the middle domains bind specifically to their cognate assembly domains but not to the assembly domains of heterologous proteins. Such specificity could be beneficial by preventing the incorporation of different dynamin family members into heterologous complexes. Curiously, we could not detect dimerization of the Mx1 assembly domain in the yeast 2-hybrid system, although the presence of leucine zippers suggests that this is likely to occurin vivo (Fig. 3). Dimerization of the Mx assembly domain might not be detectable, because the Gal4 fragment, encoded by the yeast 2-hybrid bait plasmid, also dimerizes, thus favoring a homodimer of bait chimeras over binding between bait and target chimeras. The dynamin assembly domain might be less affected by Gal4 dimerization, because the dynamin coiled coil is much weaker than that of Mx proteins. The dynamin GTPase domain and middle domain fragments used in the experiments described above overlap by 63 amino acids. To rule out the possibility that both binding activities are contained within the overlapping segment, we delineated the boundary between the GTPase and the middle domains with a deletion series (Fig. 1) that we tested with the yeast 2-hybrid system. A boundary at position 320 allowed both the GTPase domain and the middle domain to bind to the assembly domain, thereby demonstrating that these two interactions are independent (Fig. 4). Further deletions at the C terminus of the GTPase domain or at the N terminus of the middle domain completely abolishes binding, suggesting that those domains must be intact to bind to the assembly domain. Interestingly, the C-terminal 20 amino acids of the GTPase domain are predicted to form a coiled-coil with the Coils program (21Lupas A. Van Dyke M. Stock J. Science. 1991; 252: 1162-1164Crossref PubMed Scopus (3483) Google Scholar). However, the interaction between the GTPase and the assembly domain is strongly influenced by mutations affecting GTP binding (Fig. 2), which suggests that an intact GTPase domain is required to achieve optimal binding to the assembly domain. Taken together, our yeast 2-hybrid results indicate that dynamin has three independent binding activities. These interactions may provide the building blocks with which dynamin assembles into a multimeric spiral. We used cross-linking to test whether dimerization of the assembly domain can be replicated in vitro. Initial trials with cross-linkers such as BS3 (3van der Bliek A.M. Redelmeier T.E. Damke H. Tisdale E.J. Meyerowitz E.M. Schmid S.L. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 553-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar) were unsuccessful, suggesting that the few lysine residues in the assembly domain were not oriented properly for cross-linking. Instead, we used a novel cross-linking strategy, which takes advantage of the histidine tag that was included for protein purification. Nickel, chelated by the histidine tag, can be activated by magnesium monoperoxyphtalic acid to cross-link nearby proteins (19Fancy D.A. Melcher K. Johnston S.A. Kodadek T. Chem. Biol. (Lond.). 1996; 3: 551-559Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The results of in vitro cross-linking of the assembly domain, which migrates as a 15-kDa fragment, are shown in Fig. 5. A reaction product with an apparent molecular mass of 30 kDa is formed upon the addition of the cross-linking reagents nickel acetate and magnesium monoperoxyphtalic acid. No additional products are formed when an unrelated protein (carbonic anhydrase) is added to the reaction. The experiments showed that the assembly domain spontaneously dimerizes in solution, thereby supporting the yeast 2-hybrid results. To further investigate the interactions between the dynamin GTPase domain and the assembly domain, we performed in vitro binding experiments with dynamin protein fragments. Binding was achieved by incubating radiolabeled dynamin fragments together with a GST fusion protein and glutathione-Sepharose beads. Binding was detected by autoradiography of the glutathione eluates after they were fractionated by SDS-PAGE. The GTPase domain fused to GST pulls down a small fraction of radiolabeled assembly domain (Fig. 6), which indicates that in vitro binding is weak. However, the amount of assembly domain that was pulled down by GST-GTPase was increased by EDTA, which inhibits GTP binding by chelating the excess Mg2+ in the in vitro transcription/translation mixture. The strength of the binding interactions was determined by competition with unlabeled assembly domain. The amount of radiolabeled assembly domain, pulled down in binding reactions with EDTA, was reduced by half when approximately 1 μm unlabeled assembly domain was added to these reactions (data not shown). Introducing the K44A mutation into the GST-GTPase construct caused increased binding between the assembly domain and the GTPase domain (Fig. 6), similar to results obtained with the 2-hybrid system (Fig. 2). We conclude that binding interactions between the GTPase domain and the assembly domain are regulated by the nucleotide-bound state of the GTPase domain. In vitro binding between the middle domain and the assembly domain was tested in pull-down experiments. The middle domain was pulled down with GST-assembly domain but not with GST-clathrin light chain, which was used as a negative control (Fig. 7). We conclude that the three protein domains that are present in all dynamin family members are capable of binding to each other both in vitro and in the 2-hybrid system.Figure 7In vitro binding between the dynamin middle domain and the assembly domain detected with GST-pull down. The middle domain was pulled down by assembly domain fused to GST (GST-Asm). A fusion protein containing GST and clathrin light chain (GST-CLC) was used to test whether the binding reaction was specific. This fusion protein did not pull down the radiolabeled middle domain. Binding, pull-down, and detection conditions were the same as in Fig. 6. The middle domain was synthesized by in vitro transcription/translation with [35S]methionine. The GST fusion proteins were unlabeled.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) A wealth of literature describes the interactions of the dynamin PH domain and PRD with other molecules. The PH domain and PRD may cooperate to localize dynamin to clathrin-coated pits (22Shpetner H.S. Herskovits J.S. Vallee R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13-16Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 23Okamoto P.M. Herskovits J.S. Vallee R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11629-11635Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). However, the ability of dynamin to self-assemble in vitrowithout the addition of other proteins indicates that all the binding interactions necessary for spiral formation are contained within dynamin. Here, we describe the discovery of three binding interactions between different domains of dynamin, which may account for the assembly process. Two of the binding interactions were anticipated. Binding of the assembly domain to itself is consistent with the weak coiled coil predicted by the Coils program (21Lupas A. Van Dyke M. Stock J. Science. 1991; 252: 1162-1164Crossref PubMed Scopus (3483) Google Scholar), and the homologous domain in Mx proteins contains leucine zippers (24Melen K. Ronni T. Broni B. Krug R.M. von Bonsdorff C.H. Julkunen I. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25898-25907Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our yeast 2-hybrid experiments and cross-linking demonstrate that the dynamin assembly domain dimerizes. The second binding interaction, between the GTPase domain and the assembly domain, is consistent with previous results obtained with proteolytic fragments of dynamin (14Muhlberg A.B. Warnock D.E. Schmid S.L. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6676-6683Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar) and C-terminal deletions of Mx proteins (25Schwemmle M. Richter M.F. Herrmann C. Nassar N. Staeheli P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13518-13523Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Our results add to those previous reports by delineating the binding sequences and investigating the nucleotide requirements. The C-terminal 20 amino acids of the GTPase domain might form a coiled coil (21Lupas A. Van Dyke M. Stock J. Science. 1991; 252: 1162-1164Crossref PubMed Scopus (3483) Google Scholar), but this cannot be the sole determinant for binding between the GTPase domain and the assembly domain, which is regulated by nucleotides. GTP weakens binding of the GTPase domain to the assembly domain, whereas the GDP-bound and nucleotide-free states strengthen binding between the GTPase domain and the assembly domain. We could not determine whether the assembly domain induces nucleotide release or, alternatively, promotes GTP hydrolysis, because hydrolysis and release occur at very high rates even without assembly domain (data not shown). However, binding between the GTPase and the assembly domain might resemble binding between other GTP-binding proteins and guanine nucleotide release proteins, which is also stronger in the nucleotide-free state or with mutations like K44A and S45N (26Lai C.C. Boguski M. Borek D. Powers S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1345-1352Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 27Poullet P. Crechet J.B. Bernardi A. Parmeggiani A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 227: 537-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Tight binding between the K44A mutant GTPase domain and the assembly domain might lock up the dynamin spiral. This is reflected by the potent dominant negative properties of dynamin K44A mutants in transfection experiments (3van der Bliek A.M. Redelmeier T.E. Damke H. Tisdale E.J. Meyerowitz E.M. Schmid S.L. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 553-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar). Intact dynamin with the K44A mutation can assemble into a multimeric spiral in vitro. It can also retain co-assembled wild type dynamin, which would otherwise disassemble after GTP hydrolysis (17Warnock D.E. Hinshaw J.E. Schmid S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22310-22314Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Binding between the middle domain and the assembly domain was unexpected. Little or nothing is known about the function of the middle domain. In fact, we were unable to determine the exact boundaries between the GTPase domain and the middle domain by sequence comparisons, because the GTPases of dynamin-related proteins are quite different from other GTP-binding proteins. We therefore determined the boundary between the GTPase domain and the middle domain with deletions, which retained the binding activities of the GTPase domain or the middle domain. Our experiments clearly indicate that both domains have independent binding activities. The discovery of independent binding activities provides an explanation for the complex complementation patterns observed with lethal mutations in the Drosophila shibire gene (the dynamin homologue). One complementation group has mutations in the GTPase domain, whereas a second group has mutations in the middle domain (28Grant D. Unadkat S. Katzen A. Krishnan K.S. Ramaswami M. Genetics. 1998; 149: 1019-1030PubMed Google Scholar). Animals that are heteroallelic for these two complementation groups are viable, suggesting that the GTPase domain and the middle domain have independent functions. Those independent functions are most likely the different binding activities that we discovered. Binding of the assembly domain to itself suggests that the basic unit within a dynamin complex is a dimer. Other domains might also contribute to dimerization. For example, the C-terminal segment of the GTPase domain might form a short coiled coil (21Lupas A. Van Dyke M. Stock J. Science. 1991; 252: 1162-1164Crossref PubMed Scopus (3483) Google Scholar), and the PH domain might dimerize, too (29Klein D.E. Lee A. Frank D.W. Marks M.S. Lemmon M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27725-27733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Linking dimeric dynamin into a chain requires a different binding interaction. We found two possibilities. The assembly domains could bind either to the GTPase domains or to the middle domains of an adjacent dimer. It seems likely that dynamin dimers are linked in a head to tail configuration, similar to the filaments formed by septins, which are GTP-binding proteins with a C-terminal coiled coil analogous to dynamin (30Field C.M. Al-Awar O. Rosenblatt J. Wong M.L. Alberts B. Mitchison T.J. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 605-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Head to tail interactions might also contribute to the formation of tetramers, which is the predominant state of cytosolic dynamin (14Muhlberg A.B. Warnock D.E. Schmid S.L. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6676-6683Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Two different binding interactions are needed to account for dimerization and head to tail linkage. A third binding interaction might provide structural support, for example by joining the rungs of the dynamin spiral (Fig. 8). It was previously proposed that dynamin spirals are constricted by concerted conformational changes in which the subunits are shortened when they bind or hydrolyze GTP (Fig. 8B) (8Sweitzer S.M. Hinshaw J.E. Cell. 1998; 93: 1021-1029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar). Our results suggest an alternative model in which dynamin spirals are constricted by ratcheting one rung of the spiral along the next rung of the spiral (Fig. 8C). The lengths of the individual subunits need not change if the contacts between the rungs are moved up one subunit at a time. Movement might occur when the GTPase domains of one rung bind and subsequently release the assembly domains of the next rung. Such stepwise movement would be similar to the movement of ATP-driven motor molecules such as kinesins or myosins. Indeed, it had been previously noted that there is significant structural similarity between GTP-binding proteins and the ATP binding domains of kinesin and myosin (31Vale R.D. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 291-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). The lengths of the steps along the dynamin spiral are similar to the steps taken by kinesin (32Schnitzer M.J. Block S.M. Nature. 1997; 388: 386-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar). In this ratchet hypothesis, dynamin combines the enzymatic properties of GTP-binding proteins with the motor properties of kinesin and myosin. The ratchet hypothesis is consistent with previous electron microsopy data. Some of the spirals made with purified dynamin appear to be partly constricted, as if caught in the act of sliding shut (5Hinshaw J.E. Schmid S.L. Nature. 1995; 374: 190-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar). The earliest report of dynamin isolation also describes the ability of dynamin to decorate microtubules, cause microtubule bundling, and then cause the microtubules to slide along each other (33Shpetner H.S. Vallee R.B. Cell. 1989; 59: 421-432Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). Microtubule bundling might occur when the dynamin GTPases on one microtubule binds to the dynamin assembly domains on an adjacent microtubule. Runaway GTP hydrolysis by the dynamin molecules may then cause the decorated microtubules to slide along each other. The ratchet hypothesis departs from the classic perception of GTP-binding proteins as regulatory molecules. If this hypothesis is born out, then ATP-driven motor molecules, such as myosin and kinesin, might provide more meaningful paradigms (31Vale R.D. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 291-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). However, the debate on whether dynamin truly is a severing enzyme or, alternatively, acts as a regulatory GTPase needs to be settled first (34Roos J. Kelly R.B. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 257-259Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Future experiments will decide between the different hypotheses that describe dynamin function. The three domains that bind to each other are conserved throughout the dynamin family and are therefore likely to reflect common structural features (9van der Bliek A.M. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 96-102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). While this work was in progress, it was shown that the middle and assembly domains of Mx proteins bind to each other, similar to the interactions described in this paper for dynamin (35Schumacher B. Staeheli P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28365-28370Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Furthermore, purified Mx protein can form spirals as shown by electron microscopy (36Nakayama M. Yazaki K. Kusano A. Nagata K. Hanai N. Ishihama A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15033-15038Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Sequence similarity, the similar binding interactions, and the ability to form spirals raise the possibility that dynamin and Mx proteins perform similar functions but with different targets. Other dynamin family members were not yet tested in vitro nor have their cellular functions been characterized in detail. Nevertheless, the high degree of sequence similarity suggests that those other proteins might also form spirals in vitro. It is therefore possible that all these proteins use assembly and constriction mechanisms similar to dynamin. We thank G. Payne, A. Labrousse, D. Rube, and I. Davydov for their many helpful suggestions."

Human short chainl-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase has a molecular mass of 108 kDa, and its structure is quite distinct from otherl-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenases that bear the signature pattern of the l-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase family (4He X.-Y.

Although this enzyme is not homologous to the classicl-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase (l-3-HAD), which is encoded by the human HADHSC gene located at chromosome 4q22–26 (6Vredendaal P.J.C.M. van den Berg I.E.T.

Transiently expressed ERAB was reportedly localized at the endoplasmic reticulum of the cultured cells (2Yan S.D. Fu J. Soto C. Chen X. Zhu H. Al-Mohanna F. Collison K. Zhu A. Stern E. Saido T. Tohyama M. Ogawa S. Roher A. Stern D. Nature. 1997; 389: 689-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). However, this finding does not agree with the presumed function of human SCHAD/ERAB in fatty acid β-oxidation (1He X.-Y. Schulz H. Yang S.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10741-10746Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Therefore, the intracellular distribution of this dehydrogenase needed to be re-examined. Determination of the role(s) that human SCHAD plays in normal cells is of paramount importance for elucidating its role(s) in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. Because some members of the short chain dehydrogenase family display activities toward several structurally distinct substrates (7Schieber A. Frank R.W. Ghisla S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 206: 491-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), we set out to determine whether human SCHAD harbors more than one enzymatic activity. Human SCHAD is clearly homologous to the amino-terminal domain of the peroxisomal multifunctional protein-2 (MFP-2), which exhibits d-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase (d-3-HAD) activity of opposite stereospecificity (8Dienaide-Noubhani M. Novikov D. Baumgart E. Vanhooren J.C.T. Fransen M. Goethals M. Vanderkerchove J. Van Veldhoven P.P. Mannerts G.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 240: 660-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Interestingly, this domain also displays some 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (17β-HSD) activity (9Leendere F. Tesdorpf J.G. Markus M. Engel T. Seedorf U. Adamski J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5438-5442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). MFP-2 was found to be identical to the previously described 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 4 (8Dienaide-Noubhani M. Novikov D. Baumgart E. Vanhooren J.C.T. Fransen M. Goethals M. Vanderkerchove J. Van Veldhoven P.P. Mannerts G.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 240: 660-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 9Leendere F. Tesdorpf J.G. Markus M. Engel T. Seedorf U. Adamski J.

These clues prompted us to further characterize the catalytic properties of human brain SCHAD. In this report, we provide evidence that human brain SCHAD is a new 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase. Moreover, it also harbors alcohol dehydrogenase activity. This single domain multifunctional enzyme not only plays a part in the mitochondrial fatty acid β-oxidation, but also functions in steroid hormone metabolism. The cDNA insert (BamHI-EcoRI) containing the whole coding region of human brain SCHAD was removed from the recombinant plasmid pGEM-T-HBHAD (1He X.-Y. Schulz H. Yang S.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10741-10746Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) by digestion with proper restriction enzymes and subcloned into the BamHI-EcoRI site of the vector pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen) to yield a mammalian expression plasmid designated pcDNA3.1/SCHAD. The cDNA of human brain SCHAD was also amplified from pGEM-T-HBHAD by polymerase chain reaction using a pair of primers: 5′-AAGCTTCCGCCACCATGGCAGCAGCGTGTCGGA-3′ and 5′-CTGCAGAAGGCTGCATACGAATGGCC-3′. The resulting polymerase chain reaction product was cloned into the pcDNA3.1/CT-GFP-TOPO vector (Invitrogen) according to the procedures of the manufacturer to generate a SCHAD-GFP (green fluorescent protein) fusion protein expression plasmid designated pcDNA3.1/SCHAD-CT-GFP. COS-7 and PC-12 cells were grown according to the instructions of the supplier (ATCC). All culture media were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. Subconfluent cells were plated in 35-mm plates. The next day, cells were washed with fresh medium and transfected with 1 μg of pcDNA3.1/CT-GFP (Invitrogen), pcDNA3.1/SCHAD-CT-GFP, pcDNA3.1/SCHAD, and pcDNA3.1, respectively, using LipofectAMINE PLUS reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) in accordance with the protocol of the manufacturer. From 24 to 48 h post-transfection, the cells were examined for GFP expression or were used for immunocytochemical staining. Anti-SCHAD antibodies were generated by immunizing a rabbit with the peptide RLDGAIRMQP coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin with glutaraldehyde. Cells transfected with pcDNA3.1/SCHAD or pcDNA3.1 and growing on coverslips were incubated with primary anti-SCHAD antibody. The bound primary antibody was then detected with fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG (Sigma) according to a published protocol (10Johnson G.D. de C. Nogueira Aaraujo G.M. J. Immunol. Methods. 1981; 43: 349-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (1634) Google Scholar). Cells were imaged using a laser scanning confocal microscope as described below. Living cells were incubated in culture medium containing 1 μmMitoTrackerTM Red CMXRos (Molecular Probes) for 15 min at 37 °C. The live cells were then either mounted in fresh culture medium and examined directly or were immunostained as described above. Fluorescense-labeled cells were examined using a Nikon Eclipse E800 microscope coupled to a Nikon PCM 2000 dual laser scanning confocal microscopy system. Images were analyzed with a C-Imaging-SIMPLE32TM image analysis system (Compix Inc.). IPTG induction of Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3)pLysS/pSBET-HBHAD transformants, and the purification of human brain SCHAD from the transformants containing the overexpressed enzyme, were performed as described previously (1He X.-Y. Schulz H. Yang S.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10741-10746Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined by the method of Bradford (11Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (215653) Google Scholar). Proteins were separated on a 4–20% gradient gel at pH 8.3, as described previously (12Blackshear P.J. Methods Enzymol. 1984; 104: 237-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). The activity of l-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase was measured with acetoacetyl-CoA as substrate according to the published method (13Binstock J.F. Schulz H. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 71: 403-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Alcohol dehydrogenase and hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase activities were assayed at 25 °C by spectrophotometrically measuring the absorbance change at 340 nm as a function of time (14Chen Z. Jiang J.C. Lin Z.-G. Lee W.R. Baker M.E. Chang S.H. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 3342-3346Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 15Oppermann U.C.T. Filling C. Berndt K.D. Person B. Benach J. Ladenstein R. Jornall H. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 34-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The molar extinction coefficient used for calculating rates is 6220m−1 cm−1. A standard assay mixture for dehydrogenation reactions contained 0.1 mpotassium phosphate (pH 8.0), fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin (0.1 mg/ml), 100 μm steroid substrate (added in 8 μl of ethanol) or 160 mm alcohol substrate, 1 mmNAD+ (or NADP+), and appropriate quantities of enzyme. When the reduction of substrate was measured, the pH of phosphate buffer was adjusted to 6.6, and 100 μm NADH (or NADPH), and keto/aldehyde substrate were substituted for NAD+ (or NADP+) and alcohol substrate, respectively. Confirmation of steroid products, after extraction with diethyl ether, was achieved by thin-layer chromatography. Kinetic parameters for the different substrates were estimated by analysis of the kinetic data with the computer program Leonora (16Cornish-Bowden A. Analysis of Enzyme Kinetic Data. Oxford University Press, New York1995Google Scholar). A unit of activity is defined as the amount of enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of 1 μmol of substrate to product/min. The GFP and GFP-tagged human brain short chain l-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase (SCHAD-GFP) were expressed in COS-7 cells transiently transfected with pcDNA3.1/CT-GFP and pcDNA3.1/SCHAD-CT-GFP, respectively. Because GFP and its fusion protein fluoresce under UV light, GFP is a convenient molecular reporter to monitor patterns of protein localization in living cells (17Ogawa H. Inouye S. Tsuji F.I. Yasuda K. Umesono K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11899-11903Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1a, GFP was distributed uniformly throughout the cytoplasm and nucleus. In contrast, the resulting SCHAD-GFP fusion protein displayed a granulated pattern of localization (see Fig. 1d). Once mitochondria were specifically stained by a mitochondrion-selective dye with red fluorescence (Fig. 1, b and e), the punctate organelles where the GFP-tagged SCHAD localized were unequivocally identified as mitochondria (see Fig. 1f). Because GFP itself cannot enter mitochondria (Fig. 1c), these results indicate that mitochondria are the proper location for this dehydrogenase. The native SCHAD expressed in COS-7 cells transiently transfected with pcDNA3.1/SCHAD was located by immunocytochemistry (see Fig. 1g). The green fluorescence of the SCHAD/antibody complex co-localized with the red fluorescence of mitochondria (see Fig. 1,h and i). When preimmune rabbit serum was used instead of the anti-SCHAD antibodies, such green fluorescence was not observed (data not shown). Cells transfected with pcDNA3.1 vector emitted little green fluorescence after treatment with anti-SCHAD and FITC-labeled secondary antibody (data not shown). We obtained similar results when using PC-12 instead of COS-7 cells (data not shown). The human SCHAD gene product was shown to be identical to the Aβ-binding-protein, ERAB (1He X.-Y. Schulz H. Yang S.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10741-10746Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). This finding may cause some confusion about whether human SCHAD participates in mitochondrial fatty acid β-oxidation, particularly in light of a recent report localizing ERAB to the endoplasmic reticulum in transiently transfected cells (2Yan S.D. Fu J. Soto C. Chen X. Zhu H. Al-Mohanna F. Collison K. Zhu A. Stern E. Saido T. Tohyama M. Ogawa S. Roher A. Stern D. Nature. 1997; 389: 689-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). Our study, employing confocal microscopy and using either the immunocytochemistry or GFP method, resulted in fluorescence images differing from those published previously (2Yan S.D. Fu J. Soto C. Chen X. Zhu H. Al-Mohanna F. Collison K. Zhu A. Stern E. Saido T. Tohyama M. Ogawa S. Roher A. Stern D. Nature. 1997; 389: 689-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). We show that mitochondria are a major location for human SCHAD in living cells (see Fig. 1). These results strongly support our proposition (1He X.-Y. Schulz H. Yang S.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10741-10746Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) that this human dehydrogenase could act as a mitochondrial fatty acid β-oxidation enzyme. Ethanol is usually a good substrate for alcohol dehydrogenases (14Chen Z. Jiang J.C. Lin Z.-G. Lee W.R. Baker M.E. Chang S.H. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 3342-3346Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar); however, its rate of oxidation catalyzed by human brain SCHAD is not detectable (data not shown). Because we considered SCHAD to be a new member of the short chain dehydrogenase superfamily (1He X.-Y. Schulz H. Yang S.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10741-10746Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), we were interested in determining whether this mitochondrial β-oxidation enzyme is capable of converting alcohols to aldehydes or ketones. Our experiments revealed that propanol and longer chain primary alcohols could be slowly oxidized. For example, the specific activity of the purified enzyme was estimated to be 2.0 ± 0.3 nmol · min−1 · mg−1 for the dehydrogenation of 1-propanol. However, secondary alcohols were found to be better substrates. For example, 2-propanol was oxidized approximately 9-fold faster than was 1-propanol in a standard assay. Nevertheless, the rate of the backward reaction,i.e. the reduction of acetone to produce 2-propanol, was not detected. These observations suggest that human brain SCHAD, in contrast to the classic l-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase, is a multifunctional enzyme. A variety of steroid substrates were tested for the ability of human brain SCHAD to oxidize or to reduce them. We found that SCHAD could oxidize the most potent estrogen 17β-estradiol to a very weak one, estrone. This dehydrogenase can also oxidize and thereby inactivate androsterone to androstanedione. In addition, SCHAD can use NADH as coenzyme to reduce the potent androgen, 5α-dihydrotestosterone, to a weak one, dihydroandrosterone. SCHAD also displayed low activities toward C21 steroid hormones (TableI). Details of this investigation will be described in a subsequent report. Our results reveal that human brain SCHAD is a new type of oxidative 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, which possesses some 3α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase activity as well. Its primary catalytic properties were determined by steady-state kinetic measurements (16Cornish-Bowden A. Analysis of Enzyme Kinetic Data. Oxford University Press, New York1995Google Scholar, 18Segel I.H. Enzyme Kinetics, Behavior and Analysis of Rapid Equilibrium and Steady-State Enzyme System. Wiley-Interscience, New York1975Google Scholar) and are summarized in TableII. To our knowledge, porcine 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 4 was the only known oxidative 17β-HSD that had been purified to near homogeneity (9Leendere F. Tesdorpf J.G. Markus M. Engel T. Seedorf U. Adamski J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5438-5442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). It is noteworthy that the V max and theK m for 17β-estradiol of SCHAD were both 2 orders of magnitude higher than those reported for porcine 17β-HSD type 4 (9Leendere F. Tesdorpf J.G. Markus M. Engel T. Seedorf U. Adamski J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5438-5442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Therefore, the actual catalytic efficiencies of these two different oxidative 17β-HSDs are comparable.Table ISpecific activities of human brain short chainl-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase with steroid substratesSubstrateCoenzymeaWhen NAD+ and NADH were replaced by NADP+ and NADPH, respectively, no enzyme activity was detected.Specific activitybThe data from triplicate assays are given as a mean ± S.D.nmol·min −1·mg −117β-EstradiolNAD+15.6 ± 0.8EstroneNADHNDcND, not detected, implies activity of <0.0005 unit/mg.TestosteroneNAD+1.1 ± 0.2AndrostenedioneNADHNDDihydroandrosteroneNAD+130 ± 1.8AndrosteroneNAD+12.1 ± 0.9AndrosteroneNADHND5α-DihydrotestosteroneNAD+1.0 ± 0.15α-DihydrotestosteroneNADH8.7 ± 2.0EpiandrosteroneNAD+NDEpiandrosteroneNADHND5-AndrostenediolNAD+0.7 ± 0.35α-AndrostanedioneNAD+ND5α-AndrostanedioneNADH0.9 ± 0.320α-DihydroprogesteroneNAD+3.0 ± 0.6ProgesteroneNADH3.6 ± 0.220β-DihydrocortisoneNAD+NDCortisoneNADH6.5 ± 0.8CortisolNAD+0.9 ± 0.1a When NAD+ and NADH were replaced by NADP+ and NADPH, respectively, no enzyme activity was detected.b The data from triplicate assays are given as a mean ± S.D.c ND, not detected, implies activity of <0.0005 unit/mg.

Open table in a new tab The effects of pH on the 17β-HSD and l-3-HAD activities of human brain short chain l-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase were determined. The reduction of acetoacetyl-CoA tol-3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA exhibited a pH optimum of 6.5–7.0 (Fig. 2), which is quite distinct from that reported for the bovine liver enzyme (19Kobayashi A. Jiang L.L. Hashimoto T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1996; 119: 775-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). In the latter case, reaction rates continuously increase with decreasing pH (19Kobayashi A. Jiang L.L. Hashimoto T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1996; 119: 775-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). For the oxidation of 17β-estradiol to estrone, human brain SCHAD showed a pH optimum of 9.5–10.0 (Fig. 2), which is similar to that reported for human 17β-HSD type 2 (20Wu L. Einstein M. Geissler W.M. Chan H.K. Elliston K.O. Andersson S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12964-12969Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). SCHAD is different from other 17β-HSDs because of its inability to catalyze the reduction of either estrone or androstenedione by NADH or NADPH at an appreciable rate (Table I). However, its pH-activity profile for the reduction of acetoacetyl-CoA appears to be similar to the patterns determined for the reduction of estrone or androstenedione catalyzed by human 17β-HSD type 2 (20Wu L. Einstein M. Geissler W.M. Chan H.K. Elliston K.O. Andersson S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12964-12969Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus far, five different types of human 17β-HSD have been identified (20Wu L. Einstein M. Geissler W.M. Chan H.K. Elliston K.O. Andersson S. J. Biol.

Steroids. 1997; 62: 148-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). However, only type 1, which catalyzes the reduction of estrone to 17β-estradiol, has been purified to near homogeneity (25Lin S.-X. Yang F. Jin J.-Z. Breton R. Zhu D.-W. Luu-The V. Labrie F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16182-16187Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, rat 17β-HSD type 6 (26Biswas M.G. Russell D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15959-15966Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar) and mouse 17β-HSD type 7 (27Nokelainen P. Peltoketo H. Vihko R. Vihko P. Mol.

Chem. 1998; 273: 22664-22671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) were identified and reported to be new isoenzymes. However, their corresponding enzymes from human tissues have not yet been identified. The sequence identity between human 17β-HSD isoenzymes is less than 22% except that human brain SCHAD and the amino-terminal domain of peroxisomal 17β-HSD type 4 show 29% identity. Nevertheless, all of them have eight conserved residues that represent “fingerprints” typical of the short chain dehydrogenase family (29Jörnall H. Persson B. Krook M. Atrian S. Gonzàlez-Duarte R. Jeffery J. Ghosh D. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 6003-6013Crossref PubMed Scopus (1158) Google Scholar) (see Fig. 3). By comparing the structural and functional features of SCHAD with the known 17β-HSDs (see TableIII), we conclude that human SCHAD represents a new type of 17β-HSD.Table IIIComparison of human short chain l-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase with other human 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenasesEnzymeSubcellular localizationMolecular massSubunit compositionSubstratePreferred reactionCoenzymeGene location, at chromosomeOther enzymatic activityReferenceSCHAD/17β-HSDMitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum108 kDaHomotetramerEstradiol testosteroneOxidationNAD+Xp11.2l-3-HAD,3α-HSD, and alcohol dehydrogenaseThis study, 117β-HSD-5Cytosol35 kDa/subunitNDaND, not determined.AndrostenedioneReductionNADPH10p14,1524Labrie F.

Open table in a new tab A homolog of the human SCHAD gene was found on Drosophilachromosome X. A conceptual translation from the open reading frame of the Drosophila scully gene revealed a 68% identity with the primary structure of human brain SCHAD, even though thescully gene product has not yet been purified and characterized (30Torroja L. Ortuño-Sahagún D. Ferrús A. Hämmerle B. Barbas J.A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1009-1017Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The putative Drosophila short chainl-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase was thought to function in fatty acid β-oxidation because such a role agreed with the presence of aberrant mitochondria and cytoplasmic lipid inclusions inscully mutants described previously (30Torroja L. Ortuño-Sahagún D. Ferrús A. Hämmerle B. Barbas J.A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1009-1017Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). However, other important scully mutant phenotypes, such as hypogenitalism and germinal cell aplasia, cannot be explained without the knowledge that human brain SCHAD is a multifunctional enzyme with intrinsic 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase activity. Combining these observations, it seems likely that the invertebrate counterpart of human SCHAD, the scully gene product, retains enough hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase activity to play a significant part in sex steroid hormone metabolism as well as in fatty acid oxidation. The results of our present study provide new evidence for a close relationship between fatty acid metabolism and sterol metabolism. The recent observation that the sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP) stimulates the biosynthesis of cholesterol and fatty acids—particularly unsaturated fatty acids—established interdependent regulatory control at the transcriptional level for these two lipid pathways (31Pai J. Guryev O. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26138-26148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Our study, which shows that the human SCHAD gene product, a mitochondrial β-oxidation enzyme, functions as an oxidative 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (17β-HSD), establishes interdependence of metabolites in these two pathways upon a single-domain multifunctional enzyme. Together, these observations suggest that both the biosynthesis and the catabolism of intermediates in these two lipid pathways are interrelated at both the level of gene expression and enzyme function. These important observations could have wide ranging implications. 17β-Hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase is essential for sex steroid metabolism. The reductive 17β-HSDs catalyze the final step in the synthesis of potent androgens and estrogens, whereas the oxidative 17β-HSDs inactivate these androgens and estrogens. The various 17β-HSD isoenzymes display different tissue and cellular distributions and substrate specificities (Table III). Expression of reductive 17β-HSD isoenzymes across tissue types is directly related to the formation of the respective sex steroid in each tissue type. For example, 17β-HSD types 3 and 5 catalyze the formation of testosterone in the testis and peripheral tissues, respectively (22Geissler W.M. Davis D.L. Wu L. Bradshaw K.K. Patel S. Mendonca B.B. Elliston K.O. Wilson J.D. Russell D.W. Andersson S. Nat. Genet. 1994; 7: 34-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar, 24Labrie F. Luu-The V. Lin S.-X. Labrie C. Simard J. Breton R. Belanger A. Steroids. 1997; 62: 148-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). In contrast, type 1 17β-HSD converts estrone to the potent estrogen 17β-estradiol in both gonadal and nongonadal tissues, including brain (32Pelletier G. Luu-The V. Labrie F. Brain Res. 1995; 704: 233-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Reportedly, 30–50% of total androgens in males and 75% of total estrogens in females prior to menopause are synthesized in peripheral tissues (33Labrie F. Belanger A. Luu-The V. Labrie C. Simard J. Cusan L. Gomez J.-L. Candas B. Steroids. 1998; 63: 322-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Oxidative 17β-HSD, on the other hand, play a significant role in maintaining the steady-state level of each sex steroid within individual cells. 17β-HSD type 2, expressed in placenta, endometrium, and liver, inactivates androgens as well as estrogens (20Wu L. Einstein M. Geissler W.M. Chan H.K. Elliston K.O. Andersson S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12964-12969Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 17β-HSD type 4, expressed in organs that are rich in peroxisomes, catalyzes the oxidation of 17β-estradiol (8Dienaide-Noubhani M. Novikov D. Baumgart E. Vanhooren J.C.T. Fransen M. Goethals M. Vanderkerchove J. Van Veldhoven P.P. Mannerts G.P. Eur. J.

Chem. 1996; 271: 5438-5442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). We found that human SCHAD, expressed in a variety of tissues including brain, catalyzes the conversion of 17β-estradiol and dihydrotestosterone to inactive steroids (Table I). This is the first mitochondrial enzyme found to function in the catabolism of steroid hormones although several reactions essential for the conversion of cholesterol into sex steroids and bile acids have been previously shown to occur in mitochondria. Moreover, the oxidation of androsterone catalyzed by human SCHAD would yield androstanedione, a potent inhibitor of the aromatase. Therefore, overexpression of this dehydrogenase may interfere with the generation of 17β-estradiol from androgens. After menopause, all estrogens in women are synthesized in peripheral tissues (33Labrie F. Belanger A. Luu-The V. Labrie C. Simard J. Cusan L. Gomez J.-L. Candas B. Steroids. 1998; 63: 322-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). In this situation, human SCHAD and other oxidative 17β-HSDs would have an exceedingly profound impact on the control of intracellular estrogen levels. Recent clinical studies have suggested that estrogen replacement therapy can delay or prevent Alzheimer's disease (AD) (34Henderson V.W. Am. J. Med. 1997; 103: 11S-18SAbstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). A number of putative mechanisms whereby estrogens could interfere with the progression of AD have been proposed, including organizational and activational effects on the central nervous system (35Kawata M.

Brain extracts of AD patients contain significantly more human brain SCHAD/ERAB than those of age-matched controls (2Yan S.D. Fu J. Soto C. Chen X. Zhu H. Al-Mohanna F. Collison K. Zhu A. Stern E.

A high concentration of human brain SCHAD/ERAB would likely cause an estrogen-deficient state in neurons. The identification of human brain SCHAD as a new 17β-HSD leads us to propose that high concentrations of human brain SCHAD are a potential risk factor for AD. Estrogens reportedly attenuate excitotoxicity, oxidative injury, and amyloid β-peptide (Aβ) toxicity in hippocampal neurons (38Goodman Y. Bruce A.J. Cheng B. Mattson M.P. J. Neurochem. 1996; 66: 1836-1844Crossref PubMed Scopus (788) Google Scholar). Overexpression of human brain SCHAD in cultured cells would deplete 17β-estradiol, thus accounting for the high sensitivity of such cells to Aβ-induced stress and apoptosis described previously (2Yan S.D. Fu J. Soto C. Chen X. Zhu H. Al-Mohanna F. Collison K. Zhu A. Stern E. Saido T. Tohyama M. Ogawa S. Roher A. Stern D. Nature. 1997; 389: 689-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). Moreover, it was reported that aldehyde reductase confers protection upon PC-12 cells to glyoxal cytotoxicity (39Suzuki K. Koh Y.H. Mizuno H. Hamaoka R. Taniguchi N. J. Biochem. 1998; 123: 353-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), so the alcohol dehydrogenase activity of human brain SCHAD may play the opposite role of enhancing the toxicity of aldehydes. Because the human brain SCHAD/Aβ complex displays considerable enzymatic activities,2 the binding of Aβ to human brain SCHAD might exacerbate the adverse effects of this multifunctional enzyme if it would cause a relocation of SCHAD. On the basis of these observations, we believe that tuning down SCHAD expression to restore the protective effects of estrogen may ameliorate the neuronal dysfunction associated with AD. Additionally, because the human SCHAD gene product is responsible for estrogen inactivation, it would be important to assess if its expression in malignant cells of estrogen-responsive tissues such as breast cancer and endometrium cancer differs from that in normal controls. In our effort to expand insight into this important multifunctional enzyme, we are currently studying the regulatory mechanism of human SCHAD gene expression.

Intact cPLA2 is known to translocate in a calcium-dependent manner from the cytosol to the nuclear envelope and endoplasmic reticulum. We show here that the C2 domain of cPLA2 alone is sufficient for this calcium-dependent translocation in living cells. We have identified sets of exposed hydrophobic residues in loops known as calcium-binding region (CBR) 1 and CBR3, which surround the C2 domain calcium-binding sites, whose mutation dramatically decreased phospholipid binding in vitro without significantly affecting calcium binding. Mutation of a residue that binds calcium ions (D43N) also eliminated phospholipid binding. The same mutations that prevent phospholipid binding of the isolated C2 domain in vitro abolished the calcium-dependent translocation of cPLA2 to internal membranes in vivo, suggesting that the membrane targeting is driven largely by direct interactions with the phospholipid bilayer. Using fluorescence quenching by spin-labeled phospholipids for a series of mutants containing a single tryptophan residue at various positions in the cPLA2 C2 domain, we show that two of the calcium-binding loops, CBR1 and CBR3, penetrate in a calcium-dependent manner into the hydrophobic core of the phospholipid bilayer, establishing an anchor for docking the domain onto the membrane.

This enzyme has no sequence homology to any other phospholipase A2 and is capable of functioning in receptor-regulated, agonist-induced arachidonic acid release (7Lin L.-L. Lin A.Y. Knopf J.L. Proc.

Recent work with mice lacking a gene for cPLA2 has demonstrated that cPLA2 has a critical, nonredundant role in the production of eicosanoids and platelet-activating factor in the process of inflammation, anaphylaxis, and reproduction (9Uozumi N. Kume K. Nagase T. Nakatani N. Ishii S. Tashiro F. Komagata Y. Maki K. Ikuta K. Ouchi Y. Miyazaki J.-I. Shimizu T.

Nature. 1997; 390: 622-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (759) Google Scholar). The activity of cPLA2 is regulated by calcium; however, the role of calcium is to promote membrane binding rather than participating in catalysis directly. An increase in intracellular calcium triggered by calcium ionophores or agonists such as histamine or IgE/antigen causes the translocation of cPLA2 from the cytosol to the nuclear membrane and endoplasmic reticulum (11Peters-Golden M. McNish R.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 196: 147-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 12Glover S. Bayburt T. Jonas M. Chi E. Gelb M.H. J. Biol.

Biophys. 1993; 301: 439-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The activity of cPLA2 is also regulated via phosphorylation of the enzyme, and for at least some agonists, phosphorylation of cPLA2 is a requisite step in its activation (4Kramer R.M. Sharp J.D. FEBS Lett. 1997; 210: 49-53Crossref Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 5Leslie C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16709-16712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (741) Google Scholar). Detailed studies of the role of calcium and phosphorylation in arachidonic acid release have shown that a sustained increase in intracellular calcium is sufficient to induce arachidonic acid release, whereas either sustained phosphorylation of cPLA2 or a transient increase in calcium alone is not sufficient, but they can synergize in this process (16Qiu Z.-H. Gijón M.A. de Carvalho M.S. Spencer D.M. Leslie C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8203-8211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Recent work suggests that cPLA2 has three functionally distinct domains: an N-terminal C2 domain necessary for Ca2+-dependent phospholipid binding, a C-terminal Ca2+-independent catalytic region capable of hydrolyzing monomeric substrates but unable to associate with membranes (17Nalefski E.A. Sultzman L.A. Martin D.M. Kriz R.W. Towler P.S. Knopf J.L. Clark J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18239-18249Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and a putative pleckstrin homology domain within this region that may be responsible for the ability of the enzyme to make specific 1:1 interactions with phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (18Mosior M. Six D.A. Dennis E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2184-2191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). The structure of the N-terminal C2 domain of cPLA2 has been determined using both crystallographic (19Perisic O. Fong S. Lynch D.E. Bycroft M. Williams R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1596-1604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar) and NMR (20Xu G.-Y. McDonagh T. Yu H.-A. Nalefski E.A. Clark J.D. Cumming D.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 280: 485-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) techniques. The domain consists of an anti-parallel β-sandwich composed of two four-stranded sheets. The overall fold of the cPLA2 C2 domain is similar to the C2 domains from other proteins: synaptotagmin I (SytI-C2A) (21Sutton R.B. Davletov B.A. Berghuis A.M. Südhof T.C. Sprang S.R. Cell. 1995; 80: 929-938Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar), phospholipase Cδ1 (22Essen L.-O. Perisic O. Cheung R. Katan M. Williams R.L. Nature. 1996; 380: 595-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar), protein kinase Cδ (23Pappa H. Murray-Rast J. Dekker L.V. Parker P.J. McDonald N.Q. Structure. 1998; 6: 885-894Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), and protein kinase Cβ (24Sutton R.B. Sprang S.R. Structure. 1998; 6: 1395-1405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). The topology of the domain is identical to that of phospholipase Cδ1 and the recently reported calcium-independent C2 domain from protein kinase Cδ (23Pappa H. Murray-Rast J. Dekker L.V. Parker P.J. McDonald N.Q. Structure. 1998; 6: 885-894Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), whereas it is a circular permutation of the SytI-C2A and protein kinase Cβ topology. Consistent with the equilibrium binding and stopped-flow kinetic experiments that demonstrated cooperative binding of two calcium ions to the cPLA2 C2 domain (25Nalefski E.A. Slazas M.M. Falke J.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12011-12018Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), the crystal structure of cPLA2-C2 has shown two adjacent calcium ions bound at one end of the domain via residues at the bases of three loops known as calcium-binding regions (CBRs) 1–3 (19Perisic O. Fong S. Lynch D.E. Bycroft M. Williams R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1596-1604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). NMR studies with dodecylphosphocholine micelles have identified several discrete regions in cPLA2-C2 that show large chemical shift perturbations in 15N heteronuclear single quantum correlation spectra upon micelle binding (20Xu G.-Y. McDonagh T. Yu H.-A. Nalefski E.A. Clark J.D. Cumming D.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 280: 485-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). These regions, which include residues within the three CBRs, residues at the ends of strands immediately adjacent to the CBRs, and residues of strands 2 and 3, could thus directly interact with phospholipids or have their conformation changed by phospholipid binding. In this paper, we have employed a set of green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusions of cPLA2 deletion variants to show that the C2 domain is both necessary and sufficient for translocation of the enzyme to internal membranes in response to calcium. We have also demonstrated that a set of hydrophobic residues present in the calcium-binding loops at one end of the domain is necessary for Ca2+-dependent membrane translocation in vivo and phospholipid binding in vitro. Membrane binding is accompanied by penetration of two loops, CBR1 and CBR3, into the hydrophobic core of the phospholipid bilayer. Fig. 1 illustrates the various constructs that were employed in our studies. For in vivo translocation experiments, a series of human cPLA2 constructs fused to the C terminus of GFP were made: full-length cPLA2 (amino acids 1–749), a variant removing a short flexible N-terminal peptide (amino acids 17–749), a C2 domain-deleted variant (amino acids 148–749), or a C2 domain-only variant (amino acids 17–141). In the context of the full-length cPLA2 construct, three single or multiple site-specific mutants were designed to examine the effect of mutations of a calcium-binding residue (D43N) and residues proposed to be important for phospholipid binding (M38N/L39A and Y96S/V97S/M98Q). Except for the GFP-cPLA2-(17–141) fusion, all other GFP-cPLA2fusions had a His6 tag directly fused to the C terminus of the construct. GFP-cPLA2 fusions were cloned in a vector (26Levine T.P. Munro S. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 729-739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar) with a cytomegalovirus immediate-early gene promoter and the GFP protein (preceded by the sequence MVTSPVEK) containing several substitutions previously described to enhance fluorescence (S65T) and to increase solubility and thermostability of GFP (V163A/S175G/I167T) (27Siemering K.R. Golbik R. Sever R. Haseloff J. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1653-1663Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). All the cPLA2 constructs except for cPLA2-(17–141) were cloned asBamHI/XbaI fragments into the GFP-containing vector cut with the same enzymes (the internal BamHI site in the cPLA2 gene was mutated), and the resulting constructs had three residues (LGS) between the GFP and cPLA2sequences. The cPLA2-(17–141) construct was cloned as aBglII/EcoRI fragment into the vector, and the final construct had LGSMEQKLISEEDLRS between the GFP and cPLA2 sequences. A plasmid expressing the C2 domain of cPLA2 (residues 17–141 of the intact enzyme) was described previously (19Perisic O. Fong S. Lynch D.E. Bycroft M. Williams R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1596-1604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). For in vitro binding studies, site-specific mutants of this domain were prepared by polymerase chain reaction-directed mutagenesis and expressed in mini-pRSET, a version of pRSET (Invitrogen) modified to encode a 17-residue N-terminal tag (MRGSHHHHHHGLVPRGS) containing a His6 tag for affinity purification and a thrombin cleavage site. For the Trp mutants used for fluorescence quenching studies, the wild-type Trp residue at position 71 was mutated to Phe, and a single Trp residue was introduced at various positions in the C2 domain. The wild-type cPLA2 C2 domain was insoluble and expressed in inclusion bodies. The proteins were refolded in vitro using the protocol essentially as described previously (19Perisic O. Fong S. Lynch D.E. Bycroft M. Williams R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1596-1604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). The inclusion body pellet from 0.5 liter of cell culture was dissolved in 40 ml of 8 m urea and 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2 (denaturation buffer), by stirring for 2 h at room temperature and centrifuged for 30 min at 17,000 rpm in a Sorvall SS34 rotor to remove the insoluble debris. Denatured protein was bound in batch to 1.5 ml of Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (QIAGEN Inc.), and the resin was washed four times with 50 ml (each wash) of denaturation buffer. Protein was eluted with 10 ml of 300 mm imidazole in denaturation buffer. The protein was concentrated to 10–15 mg/ml using a Centriprep 10 at room temperature, and 1 ml of the purified protein was renatured by adding 50-μl aliquots into a rapidly stirred solution of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, and 1.5 murea at room temperature. After stirring for 1 h, the solution was filtered through a 0.2-μm filter (Millex-GV, Millipore Corp.) and run on a 1.6-ml Poros 20HQ column equilibrated in 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0. The renatured protein was eluted with a gradient of 0–1m NaCl (the folded protein eluted with ∼150 mm NaCl). The C2 domain mutant M38N/L39A and all the Trp mutants were insoluble and were refolded in the same way as the wild type, whereas two of the site-specific mutants (D43N and Y96S/V97S/M98Q) were soluble and required no refolding. The proteins were purified on Ni2+-agarose as described above, but without urea, and by ion-exchange chromatography on a Poros 20HQ column. PtK2 cells (potooro kidney cells) were microinjected with plasmid DNA (50 μg/ml, except for GFP-cPLA2-(17–141), which was injected at 10 μg/ml). Microinjected cells were incubated overnight to allow adequate expression of the plasmids, and culture medium was replaced with Hanks' balanced salt solution without phenol red containing 1.25 mm CaCl2 (catalog No. 14025, Life Technologies, Inc.). The GFP fluorescence of the live cells was recorded using an MRC 1024 confocal imaging system both before and after addition of 4-bromo-A23187 calcium ionophore (Alexis) at a concentration of 20 μm for 3–5 min. The ability of the recombinant cPLA2 C2 domains to bind calcium was tested qualitatively by calcium-dependent band shift on nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels. Recombinant C2 domains (0.5 mg/ml) were mixed in a 20-μl reaction with 2 mm EDTA in the presence or absence of 2.5 mm CaCl2 for 5 min at room temperature, and 4-μl aliquots were analyzed by electrophoresis on native 20% polyacrylamide Phast gels (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The positions of the bands were visualized by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. The Ca2+ binding affinity of recombinant C2 domains (wild type and M38N/L39A and Y96S/V97S/M98Q mutants) was measured by isothermal titration calorimetry with an Omega calorimeter (MicroCal Inc.) using the same conditions as described previously for the cPLA2 C2 domain (20Xu G.-Y. McDonagh T. Yu H.-A. Nalefski E.A. Clark J.D. Cumming D.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 280: 485-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). All proteins used for titrations were dialyzed against 20 mm Tris, pH 7. Aliquots (4 μl each) of calcium solution (2.4 mm) were injected at 4.6-min intervals into the protein solution (40 μm) in a 1.34-ml sample cell at 27 °C. Control experiments were carried out in the absence of protein to determine the heats of dilutions, which were subtracted from the apparent heat of binding prior to data analysis. Data were analyzed using the ORIGIN software package provided with the calorimeter. Binding of recombinant C2 domains to large multilamellar vesicles prepared with phosphatidylcholine from brain (Avanti Polar Lipids) was carried out as described previously (28Davletov B. Perisic O. Williams R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19093-19096Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The reaction mixtures (400 μl) contained 5 μg of C2 domains (final concentration of 0.77 μm), 100 μg of large multilamellar vesicles (final concentration of 330 μm), and 2 mm EDTA with or without 2.2 mm CaCl2. After incubation for 5 min at room temperature, the reaction mixtures were centrifuged for 15 min at 4 °C, and the pellets were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Fluorescence measurements were carried out on a Hitachi F-4500 fluorescence spectrometer. The intrinsic fluorescence of Trp-71 that is present in the wild-type C2 domain and D43N, M38N/L39A, and Y96S/V97S/M98Q mutants was measured using an excitation wavelength of 284 nm, and emission scans were taken from 300 to 400 nm. Binding of C2 domains to large unilamellar vesicles was quantified by measuring fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET), using Trp-71 as the donor and phosphatidylcholine vesicles containing dansyl-PE (5% mol/mol; Molecular Probes, Inc.) as the acceptor, at 20 °C. Phosphatidylcholine (PC from brain; Avanti Polar Lipids) and dansyl-PE in chloroform were mixed, dried under a stream of nitrogen and then in vacuo for at least 1 h, and resuspended in buffer F (150 mm NaCl and 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5). Large unilamellar vesicles were prepared by extrusion through a polycarbonate filter (100-nm pore size). Binding reactions contained 0.5 μm C2 domain, 1 mm EDTA plus 2 mmCaCl2 (or EDTA alone), and various amounts of phospholipids in 2 ml of buffer F. Samples were excited at 284 nm (5-nm slit width), and emission was monitored at 530 nm (10-nm slit width); a 450-nm long-pass filter was placed on the emission side. Relative FRET was calculated as (F +Ca −F −Ca)/ΔF max, whereF +Ca represents the emission of the vesicles and the C2 domain in the presence of saturating levels of calcium,F −Ca represents the emission of the vesicles and the protein in the absence of calcium, and ΔF max is the maximal energy transfer obtained from the binding curve. The data were analyzed by plotting relative FRET against the total lipid concentration and fitting the data to the binding equation y =n(x/(K d + x)), where y represents relative FRET, x is the total lipid concentration, n is a normalization constant, andK d is the apparent equilibrium dissociation constant. Large unilamellar vesicles were prepared by extrusion through a polycarbonate filter (100-nm pore size) using an Avanti Polar Lipids extruder. For cPLA2-C2 binding assays, the vesicles contained either 100% PC (control) or 90% PC and 10% doxyl-labeled PC, with a doxyl group at position 7 or 12 of thesn-2-acyl chain (Avanti Polar Lipids). For SytI-C2A binding assays, vesicles contained 50% phosphatidylserine and 50% PC (control) or 50% phosphatidylserine, 40% PC, and 10% doxyl-PC. The protein sample (final concentration of 5 μm) was diluted into a 1.6-ml assay containing 250 μm total phospholipid in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, and 2 mm EDTA in a 3-ml quartz cuvette with a magnetic stirrer. Fluorescence spectra were taken before and after addition of calcium to a final concentration of 3 mm. Samples were excited at 288 nm (2.5-nm slit width), and emission spectra were collected from 300 to 450 nm (5-nm slit width) at 20 °C. To determine if the C2 domain is sufficient for membrane translocation in response to an increase in intracellular Ca2+ or whether other features of the intact enzyme are also essential, a series of GFP-cPLA2 fusions were constructed (Fig. 1), and their translocation was observed in intact cells using confocal fluorescence microscopy. As shown in Fig. 2, the GFP fusion of full-length cPLA2 (GFP-cPLA2-(1–749)) translocates from the cytosol to internal membranes in a pattern that is consistent with binding to nuclear membranes, the endoplasmic reticulum, and the Golgi. This is in agreement with previous immunofluorescence studies of cPLA2 using fixed cells (11Peters-Golden M. McNish R.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 280: 485-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The GFP-cPLA2-(17–749) construct shows calcium-dependent translocation identical to the full-length enzyme. Using fixed cells, it was previously shown that an N-terminal truncation variant of cPLA2 (amino acids 178–749) does not translocate in response to calcium (13Schievella A.R. Regier M.K. Smith W.L. Lin L.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30749-30754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). Fig. 2shows that the deletion variant corresponding to removal of the C2 domain only, the GFP-cPLA2-(148–749) construct, also does not translocate to internal membranes. However, a GFP fusion with only the C2 domain, GFP-cPLA2-(17–141), is capable of Ca2+-dependent membrane translocation in vivo. These results show that the C2 domain consisting of residues 17–141 of cPLA2 is both necessary and sufficient for Ca2+-dependent translocation. Although the C2 domain alone enables translocation, membrane interactions by the remainder of the enzyme including the putative pleckstrin homology domain may be important for the kinetics of translocation or for the fine-tuning of the enzyme activity once on the membrane surface (18Mosior M. Six D.A. Dennis E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2184-2191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar,29Hixon M.S. Ball A. Gelb M.H. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 8516-8526Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Several mutants were examined in the context of the isolated C2 domain to assess the contributions of various residues to membrane binding. The experimentally determined structure of the cPLA2 C2 domain served as a guide to select residues that would be likely candidates for participation in membrane interactions. The double mutant M38N/L39A and the triple mutant Y96S/V97S/M98Q were examined in order to ascertain the importance of the exposed hydrophobic residues in CBR1 and CBR3, respectively, for membrane binding. In vitro binding studies were carried out for the isolated C2 domains, whereas the effect of the mutants on in vivo translocation was assayed in the context of the full-length enzyme. All of the C2 domain constructs used for in vitrobinding assays were monomers as analyzed by gel filtration (data not shown) and correctly folded as judged by intrinsic fluorescence spectra (Fig. 3). The membrane binding properties of these mutants were compared with those of the D43N mutant, in which the acidic residue shown crystallographically to bind both Ca2+ ions was replaced by a neutral analogue. The ability of C2 domain mutants to bind Ca2+ was first evaluated using a rapid gel-shift assay, which is based on a large difference in the overall charge between a Ca2+-bound and Ca2+-free form of cPLA2-C2 and, consequently, differential migration on a native gel. Neither the mutations in CBR1 nor CBR3 significantly affected Ca2+ binding at the high concentration of free Ca2+ (0.5 mm) that was used in the Ca2+-dependent gel-shift assay, whereas, as expected, the D43N mutant did not bind Ca2+(Fig. 4A). The calcium binding affinities of the CBR1 and CBR3 mutants were further examined by isothermal titration calorimetry and compared with those of the wild-type C2 domain. For wild-type cPLA2-C2, aK d of 2.4 μm was determined, in excellent agreement with the K d of 1.7 μm that was determined previously for a similar cPLA2-C2 construct (residues 1–138) by isothermal titration calorimetry under the same experimental conditions (20Xu G.-Y. McDonagh T. Yu H.-A. Nalefski E.A. Clark J.D. Cumming D.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 280: 485-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Mutations in CBR1 and CBR3 had only a modest effect on calcium binding affinities, with K d values of 9.2 and 7.6 μm, respectively. Despite their abilities to bind Ca2+, the CBR1 and CBR3 mutants did not bind PC vesicles at saturating Ca2+ concentrations as shown by both multilamellar large vesicle sedimentation assays (Fig. 4B) and FRET assays (Fig. 4C). Using the FRET analysis, an apparent K d for PC binding of 11 ± 2 μm was obtained for the wild-type C2 domain, in agreement with previously reported affinities (25Nalefski E.A. Slazas M.M. Falke J.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12011-12018Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 29Hixon M.S. Ball A. Gelb M.H. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 8516-8526Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In contrast, none of the mutants showed any measurable FRET at the highest lipid concentration used (250 μm) and 1 mm Ca2+. Higher phospholipid concentrations could not be tested due to an inner filter effect of the lipid vesicles. As a consequence of its impaired Ca2+ binding, the D43N mutant also showed no detectable binding to PC vesicles (Fig. 4, B and C). All three mutations that inhibited in vitro vesicle binding also abolished in vivo membrane translocation of the full-length protein in response to Ca2+ (Fig. 5).Figure 5Mutations of the C2 domain prevent translocation of GFP-cPLA2 in PtK2 cells.

By monitoring the intrinsic fluorescence of these mutants, it is possible to infer which of these residues enters a more non-polar environment upon vesicle binding. These Trp replacements were constructed in the context of a mutant enzyme in which the only endogenous Trp residue in the wild-type enzyme (Trp-71) was replaced by phenylalanine. The positions at which Trp replacement mutants were created are illustrated in Fig. 6 and include F35W in CBR1, F49W at the end of strand β2, F63W at the beginning of CBR2, and Y96W and V97W in CBR3.

The cell cycle regulatory events leading to sst2-mediated growth arrest are not known. Here, we report that treatment of Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing sst2 with the somatostatin analogue, RC-160, led to G1cell cycle arrest and inhibition of insulin-induced S-phase entry through induction of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27 Kip1. Consequently, a decrease of p27 Kip1-cdk2 association, an inhibition of insulin-induced cyclin E-cdk2 kinase activity, and an accumulation of hypophosphorylated retinoblastoma gene product (Rb) were observed. However, RC-160 had no effect on the p21 Waf1/Cip1. When sst2 was coexpressed with a catalytically inactive mutant SHP-1 in Chinese hamster ovary cells, mutant SHP-1 induced entry into cell cycle and down-regulation of p27 Kip1and prevented modulation by insulin and RC-160 of p27 Kip1expression, p27 Kip1-cdk2 association, cyclin E-cdk2 kinase activity, and the phosphorylation state of Rb. In mouse pancreatic acini, RC-160 reverted down-regulation of p27 Kip1 induced by a mitogen, and this effect did not occur in acini from viable motheaten (me v /me v) mice expressing a mutant SHP-1 with markedly deficient enzymes. These findings provide the first evidence that sst2 induces cell cycle arrest through the up-regulation of p27 Kip1 and demonstrate that SHP-1 is required for maintaining high inhibitory levels of p27 Kip1and is a critical target of the insulin, and somatostatin signaling cascade, leading to the modulation of p27 Kip1.

Somatostatin is a widely distributed inhibitory hormone that plays an important role in several biological processes including neurotransmission, inhibition of exocrine and endocrine secretions, and cell proliferation. The diverse biological effects of somatostatin are mediated through a family of five somatostatin receptors (sst1-sst5) that belong to the family of G-protein-coupled receptors and that regulate diverse signal transduction pathways including adenylate cyclase, phospholipase C-β, phospholipase A2, guanylate cyclase, ionic conductance channels, and tyrosine phosphatase (1Lewin M.J. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1992; 54: 455-468Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,2Patel Y.C. J. Endocrinol. Invest. 1997; 20: 348-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). The ability of somatostatin and its stable analogues to promote inhibition of normal and tumor cell growth has been demonstrated in various cell types including mammary, prostatic, gastric, pancreatic, colorectal, and small cell lung cancer cells (3Liebow C. Reilly C. Serrano M. Schally A.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 2003-2007Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar, 4Lamberts S.W. Krenning E.P. Reubi J.C. Endocr. Rev. 1991; 12: 450-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (848) Google Scholar). However, the mechanisms of cell growth arrest by somatostatin are still poorly understood. Somatostatin analogues induce a G0/G1 cell cycle arrest and thus prevent DNA synthesis in GH3 rat pituitary tumor cells, whereas they induce a transient G2/M blockade as well as apoptosis in MCF7 human mammary tumor cells (5Cheung N.W. Boyages S.C. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 4174-4181Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar, 6Pagliacci M.C. Tognellini R. Grignani F. Nicoletti I. Endocrinology. 1991; 129: 2555-2562Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). These tumor cells express multiple somatostatin receptors and the question of whether different somatostatin receptor(s) may be involved in eliciting these effects still remains to be clarified. A specific role for sst3 in transducing apoptosis through an induction of p53 and Bax has been reported (7Sharma K. Patel Y.C. Srikant C.B. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 1688-1696Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Control of the cell cycle machinery by other receptors is an important problem that remains to be addressed. Our studies on the expression of somatostatin receptor subtypes in heterologous systems led us to demonstrate that sst2 selectively mediates the antiproliferative effect of somatostatin analogues on serum- or insulin-induced cell growth through the stimulation of a protein-tyrosine phosphatase (8Buscail L.

However, the effect of sst2 as well as the role of SHP-1 on cell cycle parameters remain unknown. Cell cycle progression is dependent on the coordinated interaction, posttranslational modification, and degradation of cyclins and their catalytic partners, cyclin-dependent kinases (cdks). 1The abbreviations used are: cdk, cyclin-dependent kinase; Rb, retinoblastoma gene product; pRb, phosphorylated Rb; CHO, chinese hamster ovary; αMEM, minimal essential medium; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; EGF, epidermal growth factor. Cyclins are expressed at particular stages of the cell cycle and associate with specific cdks to form active complexes that phosphorylate multiple proteins and promote cell cycle progression. In mammalian cells, progression through early to middle G1 phase of the cell cycle is dependent on cdk4/and/or cdk6, which are activated by D-type cyclins. Transition through middle G1 to S phase is regulated by activation of cdk2 by cyclin E, cdk2, and cyclin A is required for late G1 to S-phase progression and throughout S phase. One of the critical targets of cyclin-cdk complexes is the retinoblastoma gene product (Rb). Rb acts as a transcriptional repressor. In its hypophosphorylated form, it binds to the E2F family of cell cycle transcription factors during G1 phase and inhibits E2F activity. Rb is inactivated by cdk phosphorylation in mid to late G1 phase of the cell cycle and dissociates from E2F, leading to activation of genes containing E2F sites and a progression from G1 to S phase (reviewed in Ref. 12Sherr C.J. Roberts J.M. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1149-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (3221) Google Scholar). Another level of regulation of cdk activity results from the action of cdk inhibitors that bind cyclin-cdk complexes and either inhibit their kinase activities or prevent their activation by cdk-activating kinase (reviewed in Refs. 13Sherr C.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 187-190Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (890) Google Scholar and 14Morgan D.O. Nature. 1995; 374: 131-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (2938) Google Scholar). In mammalian cells, cdk inhibitors comprise two classes of proteins, the Ink4 family including p16 Ink4a, p15 Ink4b, p18 Ink4c, and p19 Ink4d, which specifically inhibit cyclin D-dependent kinases, cdk4 and cdk6 (12Sherr C.J. Roberts J.M. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1149-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (3221) Google Scholar), and the p21 family including p21 Cip1/Waf1, p27 Kip1, and p57 Kip2(15Harper J.W. Adami G.R. Wei N.

Among them, p27 Kip1 is a widely distributed cdk inhibitor that has an important role regulating entry into and exit from the cell cycle. p27 Kip1 is abundantly expressed in normal quiescent cells and is down-regulated by mitogens. The decrease in p27 Kip1 expression occurs through protein degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway after p27 Kip1 phosphorylation by cyclin E-cdk2 complexes (20Pagano M. Tam S.W.

Increased levels of p27 Kip1induced by transforming growth factor β, contact inhibition, serum deprivation, rapamycin, or staurosporine have been associated with a G1 arrest (18Toyoshima H. Hunter T.

In contrast, an overexpression of p27 Kip1 antisense cDNA results in mitogen-independent G1 progression, demonstrating the importance of p27 Kip1 in controlling cell cycle exit (25Rivard N.

In this study, we investigated the potential effects of sst2 on cell cycle progression and expression of cell cycle regulatory proteins in CHO cells expressing sst2 (CHO/sst2). Activation of sst2 caused a G1 cell cycle arrest in-phase accompanied by an increased expression of cdk inhibitor p27 Kip1, which resulted in an increase of its association with cdk2 and a decrease in cdk2 activity and led to dephosphorylation of protein Rb. The role of SHP-1 in sst2-mediated regulatory mechanisms was investigated in CHO cells coexpressing sst2 and a negative SHP-1 (C453S) mutant as well as in acini isolated from viable motheaten mice expressing a mutant SHP-1 with markedly deficient enzyme activity. Our results provide evidence that SHP-1 is a critical regulator of p27 Kip1. This enzyme is required for the maintenance of cell quiescence and is involved in the sst2-mediated up-regulation of p27 Kip1 leading to cell cycle arrest.

Fluorescence of labeled cell nuclei was measured by flow cytometry using a FACScan (Beckton Dickinson) with a minimum of 10,000 events performed for each sample. Data were analyzed using LYSIS II software. Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and then with buffer B. Cells were lysed in 500 μl of buffer B containing 1% Triton X-100, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonylfluoride, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, 20 μmleupeptin. After a 15-min incubation at 4 °C, the lysate was collected and centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Soluble proteins (300–500 μg) were incubated for 3 h at 4 °C with specific antibodies or preimmune serum prebound to Sepharose-protein A beads prewashed in buffer B. The beads were then washed twice with buffer B and resuspended in sample buffer for immunoblotting. For immunoblotting, solubilized proteins or immunoprecipitated proteins (see above) were resolved on 7.5% or 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, and immunoblotted with specific antibodies as described previously (9Lopez F. Estève J.-P. Buscail L. Delesque N. Saint-Laurent N. Theveniau M. Nahmias C. Vaysse N. Susini C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24448-24454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Immunoreactive proteins were visualized by the ECL immunodetection system and quantified by image analysis using a Biocom apparatus (Biocom, Paris, France). Immunoprecipitated proteins with anti-cdk2 or anticyclin E antibodies were collected by centrifugation and washed four times with buffer B and twice with 50 mm HEPES buffer containing 1 mm dithiotreitol (pH 7.4). The beads were suspended in 40 μl of kinase buffer containing 50 mmHEPES (pH 7.5), 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 4 μg of histone H1, 2.5 mm EGTA, 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm NaF, 50 μm ATP, and 10 μCi of [γ-33P]ATP (1000–3000 Ci/mmol) and incubated for 30 min at 25 °C. Each sample was mixed with 20 μl of 2× SDS sample buffer, heated for 5 min at 100 °C, and subjected to SDS-PAGE. The gel was fixed in 40% methanol, 10% acetic acid and exposed to hyperfilm ECL. We previously reported that in CHO cells expressing sst2, the addition of the somatostatin analogue, RC-160, for 24 h to the culture medium led to inhibition of the mitogenic effect of insulin (10Bousquet C. Delesque N. Lopez F. Saint-Laurent N. Estève J.-P. Bedecs K. Buscail L. Vaysse N. Susini C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7099-7106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). To analyze whether RC-160-mediated inhibition of cell proliferation reflects a stage-specific arrest of the cell cycle, cells were rendered quiescent by serum deprivation and incubated with 100 nm insulin in the presence or absence of 1 nm RC-160 and then analyzed by flow cytometry. Cells grown in the absence of fetal calf serum were taken as control values. The treatment of cells with insulin increased the percentage of cells in the S phase, which reached 27% at 6 h and increased up to 50% at 24 h of treatment (data not shown). The simultaneous treatment of cells with insulin and RC-160 for 6 h prevented cells from entering into the S phase, RC-160 causing a decrease in the percentage of cells in the S phase (−43%) and an accumulation of cells in the G1 phase, which increased from 57% in the absence of RC-160 to 72% (Fig. 1). For longer treatment, RC-160 had no significant effect on the G1/S transition (data not shown). We concluded that activation of sst2 by ligand induces a G1 cell cycle arrest in CHO/sst2 cells. Furthermore, treatment of cells with 1 μm orthovanadate suppressed the RC 160-induced decrease of number of cells in the S phase as well as the increase of cells in the G1 phase, indicating that a tyrosine phosphatase was required in the RC-160 effects (data not shown). G1 progression depends on an orderly and coordinated expression of cyclins that bind to and activate cdks, the activity of which is negatively regulated by their association with a family of cdk inhibitory proteins. Therefore we investigated whether sst2-mediated cell cycle arrest is associated with a change in the expression of the cdk inhibitors. We first examined the expression of the Kip/Cip family cdk inhibitor p27 Kip1, which has been demonstrated to be involved in the regulation of cell cycle progression induced by various antiproliferative stimuli that cause G1-phase arrest (23Polyak K.

Science. 1996; 272: 877-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar). CHO/sst2 cells were treated for various times with insulin in the presence or not of RC-160, and the level of p27 Kip1 was investigated by Western blot analysis. As observed in Fig. 2, p27 Kip1 was expressed at high level in growth-arrested control cells, and after 3 h of insulin treatment, its expression decreased by 45% (p < 0.05), consistent with previous results reported for mitogenic signals (26Coats S. Flanagan W.M. Nourse J. Roberts J.M. Science. 1996; 272: 877-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar, 31Mann D.J. Higgins T. Jones N.C. Rozengurt E.

The decrease of p27 Kip1 level was transient, the level of this cdk inhibitor being not significantly different from that in control cells by 24 h. The addition of RC-160 resulted in a 4-fold increase (p < 0.02) in the level of p27 Kip1 during the first 3 h. Elevated levels of p27 Kip1 were found to return to control levels at 24 h of treatment with RC-160. Treatment of cells with 1 μmorthovanadate for 3 h suppressed the RC 160-induced increase of p27 Kip1, indicating that this effect is dependent on a tyrosine phosphatase (Fig. 2). The expression of the other member of the Kip/Cip family cdk inhibitors, p21 Waf1/Cip1, was also examined in CHO/sst2 cells. In contrast to p27 Kip1, p21 Waf1/Cip1 was found to be barely detectable in control cells (Fig. 3), as observed by others in quiescent cells (33Akiyama T. Yoshida T. Tsujita T. Shimizu M. Mizukami T. Okabe M. Akinaga S. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 1495-1501PubMed Google Scholar). As reported for mitogens in other cell systems (32Aktas H. Cai H. Cooper G.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3850-3857Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar, 34Reynisdottir I. Polyak K. Iavarone A. Massague J. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1831-1845Crossref PubMed Scopus (893) Google Scholar), insulin induced an increase of its expression up to 24 h, suggesting that elevated p21 Waf1/Cip1 is not related to insulin-mediated G1/S transition. However, the addition of RC-160 did not significantly modify the insulin-induced expression of p21 Waf1/Cip1 irrespective of the time of treatment, suggesting that this inhibitor is not involved in the somatostatin-mediated growth arrest. It has been shown in many cell types that among the G1 cyclin-cdk complexes negatively regulated by p27 Kip1, the up-regulation of p27 Kip1 in response to growth inhibitory factors favors its association with cyclin E-cdk2, resulting in kinase inhibition and contributing to cell growth arrest (34Reynisdottir I. Polyak K. Iavarone A. Massague J. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1831-1845Crossref PubMed Scopus (893) Google Scholar). Therefore, we first tested whether somatostatin analogue-mediated increases in the level of p27 Kip1 should be reflected in a change of the kinase activity of cdk2-associated complexes, as measured by an in vitro assay on cdk2 immunoprecipitates using histone H1 protein as a substrate. In comparison with the control activity detected in resting CHO/sst2 cells, cdk2 kinase activity was increased by about 2-fold after 3 h of treatment with insulin, as revealed by the heavily phosphorylated histone H1 level. When RC-160 was added to the culture, the cdk2-dependent kinase activity was inhibited by 80% during the first 3 h of culture (Fig. 4A). Similarly, RC-160 induced a decrease of about 80% insulin-induced increase of cyclin E-cdk2 associated kinase activity (Fig. 4B). In addition, the amount of p27 Kip1 associated with cdk2 was decreased by 70% after treatment of cells for 3 h with insulin, whereas the addition of RC-160 increased the level of the complexes by 87% (Fig. 4C). These results indicate that insulin and RC-160 could contrarily modulate the level of cdk2-cyclin E complexes, free from the constraining influence of p27 Kip1 inhibitor and the resulting kinase activity of the complexes. We then analyzed the steady-state level of expression of cyclin E and cdk proteins by immunoblotting. As shown in Fig. 4D, the amount of cdk2 detected in control cells and in insulin-treated cells was not significantly modified by RC-160 treatment. Anticyclin E antibodies revealed that cyclin E was barely detectable in control cells, and treatment of cells for 3 h with insulin induced an increase of the level of cyclin E as observed for agents that promote DNA synthesis (31Mann D.J. Higgins T. Jones N.C. Rozengurt E. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 1759-1766Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The addition of RC-160 resulted in a 50% inhibition of cyclin E expression after 3 h of treatment. One of the targets of cdk includes pRb protein, as its hyperphosphorylated form was proven to be a critical check point involved in regulating progression through late G1 and into S phase. The extent of pRb phosphorylation was first analyzed in soluble extracts of CHO/sst2 cells incubated in the presence of 100 nm insulin with or without 1 nm RC-160 for various times. A specific antibody able to detect the active hypophosphorylated form of pRb (Fig. 5, lower band) as well as the inactive slower migrating hyperphosphorylated form o"

According to the prevailing model these signals target proteins to the ER by COP I-mediated retrieval from post-ER compartments, whereas the actual retention mechanism in the ER is unknown. We expressed chimeric membrane proteins with a C-terminal -Lys-Lys-Ala-Ala (KKAA) or -Lys-Lys-Phe-Phe (KKFF) dilysine signal in Lec-1 cells. Unlike KKFF constructs, which had access to post-ER compartments, the KKAA chimeras were localized to the ER by confocal microscopy and were neither processed by cis-Golgi-specific enzymes in vivonor included into ER-derived transport vesicles in an in vitro budding assay, suggesting that KKAA-bearing proteins are permanently retained in the ER. The ER localization was nonsaturable and exclusively mediated by the dilysine signal because mutating the lysines to alanines led to cell surface expression of the chimeras. Although the KKAA signal avidly binds COP I in vitro, the ER retention by this signal does not depend on intact COP I in vivo because it was not affected in an ε-COP-deficient cell line. We propose that dilysine ER targeting signals can mediate ER retention in addition to retrieval. Dilysine signals confer localization of type I membrane proteins to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER).

We propose that dilysine ER targeting signals can mediate ER retention in addition to retrieval. Many type I membrane proteins carry a dilysine signal in their cytosolic domain that confers localization to the ER (1Teasdale R.D. Jackson M.R. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 27-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). 1The abbreviations used are: ER, endoplasmic reticulum; endo-D, endoglycosidase D; ERGIC, ER/Golgi intermediate compartment; mAb, monoclonal antibody; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; HSP, high speed pellet. 1The abbreviations used are: ER, endoplasmic reticulum; endo-D, endoglycosidase D; ERGIC, ER/Golgi intermediate compartment; mAb, monoclonal antibody; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; HSP, high speed pellet. This signal has been defined as two lysine residues at positions −3 and −4 (KKXX) or −3 and −5 (KXKXX) from the C terminus exposed on the cytosolic side of the ER membrane (2Jackson M.R. Nilsson T. Peterson P.A. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3153-3162Crossref PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar). Chimeric proteins bearing a dilysine signal are localized to the ER but can acquire Golgi-specific carbohydrate modifications, suggesting that ER localization involves retrieval from the Golgi (3Gaynor E.C. te Heesen S.

Recent evidence implicates COP I (coat protein typeI) in the recognition of the dilysine signal. COP I (coatomer) is a complex of seven proteins termed α-, β-, β′-, γ-, δ-, ε-, and ζ-COP (6Duden R.

Slot J.W. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 49-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Functional dilysine signals bind to coatomer in vitro (10Cosson P. Letourneur F. Science. 1994; 263: 1629-1631Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar), and yeast mutants of COP subunits fail to localize reporter proteins to the ER (11Letourneur F. Gaynor E.C. Hennecke S.

Some of these mutants are unable to bind to functional dilysine signalsin vitro, supporting the notion that coatomer plays an essential role in retrograde Golgi-to-ER transport of dilysine-bearing proteins.The ERGIC marker protein ERGIC-53 is a type I membrane protein carrying a dilysine signal with the sequence -Lys-Lys-Phe-Phe (KKFF) (14Hauri H.P. Schweizer A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1992; 4: 600-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). ERGIC-53 is a mannose lectin continuously recycling in the early secretory pathway, suggesting that it may operate as a transport receptor for glycoproteins (15Itin C. Roche A.C. Monsigny M. Hauri H.P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 483-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 16Klumperman J. Schweizer A. Clausen H. Tang B.L. Hong W. Oorschot V. Hauri H.-P. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 3411-3425PubMed Google Scholar). In support of this notion, antibodies to the cytoplasmic tail of ERGIC-53 inhibit transport of vesicular stomatitis virus G protein (17Tisdale E.J. Plutner H. Matteson J. Balch W.E. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 581-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), mistargeting of ERGIC-53 to the ER impairs the secretion of cathepsin C (18Vollenweider F. Kappeler F. Itin C. Hauri H.-P. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 377-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), and mutations in ERGIC-53 can lead to combined factor V/VIII deficiency in humans presumably due to inefficient secretion of these coagulation factors (19Nicholls W.C. Seligsohn U. Zivelin A. Terry V.H. Hertel C.E. Wheatley M.A. Moussalli M.J. Hauri H.-P. Ciavarella N. Kaufman R.J. Ginsburg D. Cell. 1998; 93: 61-71Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). Targeting of ERGIC-53 is controlled by at least three signals. In addition to the dilysine signal the two C-terminal phenylalanines operate as an ER exit determinant (20Kappeler F. Klopfenstein D.R. Foguet M. Paccaud J.P. Hauri H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31801-31808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Moreover, the luminal and transmembrane domains of ERGIC-53 in combination contain information for intracellular retention that is abolished by exchanging the transmembrane domain of ERGIC-53 by that of the plasma membrane protein CD4 (20Kappeler F. Klopfenstein D.R. Foguet M. Paccaud J.P. Hauri H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31801-31808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). If the two C-terminal phenylalanines are changed to alanines, resulting in the C-terminal sequence KKAA, ERGIC-53 is mislocalized to the ER (20Kappeler F. Klopfenstein D.R. Foguet M. Paccaud J.P. Hauri H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31801-31808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 21Itin C. Schindler R. Hauri H.P. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 57-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Although the most straightforward interpretation of this finding is that the replacement of the two phenylalanines inactivates the ER exit signal, an alternative possibility is that the dilysine signal KKAA mediates direct retention in the ER. To test for retention, we have transferred the KKAA dilysine signal to a plasma membrane reporter protein, CD4, that is known not to carry intracellular retention information. Here we show that chimeric proteins possessing the C-terminal dilysine signal KKAA are permanently retained in the ER, in contrast to KKFF chimeras that can leave the ER. The results suggest that dilysine signals can operate in both ER retention and retrieval.DISCUSSIONIt is currently assumed that dilysine targeting signals operate by retrieval rather than retention (1Teasdale R.D. Jackson M.R. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 27-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). This notion is based on the findings that chimeras bearing some dilysine signals carry Golgi-specific carbohydrate modifications despite their localization to the ER both in mammalian and yeast cells (2Jackson M.R. Nilsson T. Peterson P.A. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3153-3162Crossref PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar, 3Gaynor E.C. te Heesen S. Graham T.R. Aebi M. Emr S.D. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 653-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 4Jackson M.R. Nilsson T. Peterson P.A. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 317-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar).Surprisingly, we were unable to find evidence for recycling of chimeric proteins with a C-terminal KKAA dilysine signal. These chimeras localized to the ER, did not acquire Golgi-dependent endo-D sensitivity in Lec1 cells, were not concentrated in the ERGIC by AlF4−, and were excluded from ER-derived transport vesicles. These data strongly support the notion that KKAA is a true ER retention signal. ER retention is not simply due to the lack of an ER-export signal because chimeras with a polyalanine tail lacking transport information were not retained. Moreover, the inactivation of an ER exit signal does not entirely block ER exit (20Kappeler F. Klopfenstein D.R. Foguet M. Paccaud J.P. Hauri H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31801-31808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar,32Nishimura N. Balch W.E. Science. 1997; 277: 556-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). It has previously been noted that the rate at which various dilysine signal-tagged reporter proteins acquired Golgi modifications greatly varied, as did the degree to which they co-localized to post-ER compartments (4Jackson M.R. Nilsson T. Peterson P.A. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 317-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). It was therefore proposed that the sequence context of a dilysine motif may affect the efficiency of retrieval (1Teasdale R.D. Jackson M.R. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 27-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). Our data with KKAA suggest retention as an additional function of dilysine signals, whereby the sequence context of dilysine signals determines the efficiency of ER retention. Although it is likely that the sequence context also affects the efficiency of protein retrieval, this issue remains to be reinvestigated in light of our present findings.What is the mechanism by which KKAA mediates ER retention? Previous transfection experiments in COS cells have shown that the intracellular retention of ERGIC-53 and CD4 chimeras carrying the wild type KKFF signal is saturable by overexpression very much in contrast to that of ERGIC-53 terminating in KKAA (21Itin C. Schindler R. Hauri H.P. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 57-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 33Kappeler F. Itin C. Schindler R. Hauri H.-P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6279-6281Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It was of interest therefore to determine whether COP I known to specifically recognize dilysine signals plays a role in the ER retention mediated by the KKAA signal. Although the KKAA signal avidly binds COP I in vitro (20Kappeler F. Klopfenstein D.R. Foguet M. Paccaud J.P. Hauri H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31801-31808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar) and COP I has be localized to some areas of the ER (34Orci L. Perrelet A. Ravazzola M. Amherdt M. Rothman J.E. Schekman R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11924-11928Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), our results with the ε-COP-deficient ldlF cells suggest that intact coatomer is not required for ER retention. Unlike CD4R2A10 the KKAA protein did not acquire cis-Golgi-specific carbohydrate modifications in these cells at the nonpermissive temperature. Under these conditions coatomer of ldlF cells is unable to bind to the dilysine signal. 2M. Gomez, personal communication. These data are in line with the notion that COP I is primarily involved in retrograde transport (11Letourneur F. Gaynor E.C. Hennecke S. Demolliere C. Duden R. Emr S.D. Riezman H. Cosson P. Cell. 1994; 79: 1199-1207Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar), although other traffic routes may also depend on coatomer. Another possibility for retention would be tight interaction of the KKAA signal with microtubules. Studies with a synthetic peptide containing the dilysine signal of the adenovirus E19 protein indicate that this peptide can bind β-tubulin and promote tubulin polymerization in vitro (35Dahllof B. Wallin M. Kvist S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1804-1808Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, if microtubules were destroyed by nocodazole, KKAA-mediated ER retention was not affected, 3H. Andersson and H.-P. Hauri, unpublished observations. rendering such a mechanism less likely. Yet another notion for protein retention in a membrane organelle is the formation of oligomers too large to be included into transport vesicles (36Munro S. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 11-15Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Such a mechanism appears unlikely because CD4 is a monomer and KKAA-bearing ERGIC-53 oligomerizes with normal kinetics and no such large aggregates were observed (Ref. 21Itin C. Schindler R. Hauri H.P. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 57-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar and this study). Interaction with an ER resident protein appears a likely possibility for explaining the ER retention, although our attempts to identify such a partner protein were unsuccessful. Interaction with ER-specific lipids is another possibility that remains to be tested.In conclusion, we have shown that the dilysine signal KKAA mediates permanent retention of type I membrane proteins in the ER. We propose that dilysine ER targeting signals can mediate retention in addition to retrieval. Thus protein targeting to the ER by dilysine signals can be mediated by at least two mechanisms that are not mutually exclusive: signal-mediated retention and signal-mediated retrieval. Many type I membrane proteins carry a dilysine signal in their cytosolic domain that confers localization to the ER (1Teasdale R.D. Jackson M.R. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 27-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). 1The abbreviations used are: ER, endoplasmic reticulum; endo-D, endoglycosidase D; ERGIC, ER/Golgi intermediate compartment; mAb, monoclonal antibody; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; HSP, high speed pellet. 1The abbreviations used are: ER, endoplasmic reticulum; endo-D, endoglycosidase D; ERGIC, ER/Golgi intermediate compartment; mAb, monoclonal antibody; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; HSP, high speed pellet.

Recent evidence implicates COP I (coat protein typeI) in the recognition of the dilysine signal. COP I (coatomer) is a complex of seven proteins termed α-, β-, β′-, γ-, δ-, ε-, and ζ-COP (6Duden R. Griffiths G. Frank R. Argos P. Kreis T.E. Cell. 1991; 64: 649-665Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar, 7Rothman J.E.

Nature. 1991; 349: 248-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar) mainly localized to the ER/Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) and the Golgi (9Oprins A. Duden R. Kreis T.E. Geuze H.J. Slot J.W. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 49-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Functional dilysine signals bind to coatomer in vitro (10Cosson P. Letourneur F. Science. 1994; 263: 1629-1631Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar), and yeast mutants of COP subunits fail to localize reporter proteins to the ER (11Letourneur F. Gaynor E.C. Hennecke S.

Some of these mutants are unable to bind to functional dilysine signalsin vitro, supporting the notion that coatomer plays an essential role in retrograde Golgi-to-ER transport of dilysine-bearing proteins. The ERGIC marker protein ERGIC-53 is a type I membrane protein carrying a dilysine signal with the sequence -Lys-Lys-Phe-Phe (KKFF) (14Hauri H.P. Schweizer A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1992; 4: 600-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). ERGIC-53 is a mannose lectin continuously recycling in the early secretory pathway, suggesting that it may operate as a transport receptor for glycoproteins (15Itin C. Roche A.C. Monsigny M. Hauri H.P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 483-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 16Klumperman J. Schweizer A. Clausen H. Tang B.L. Hong W. Oorschot V. Hauri H.-P. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 3411-3425PubMed Google Scholar). In support of this notion, antibodies to the cytoplasmic tail of ERGIC-53 inhibit transport of vesicular stomatitis virus G protein (17Tisdale E.J. Plutner H. Matteson J. Balch W.E. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 581-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), mistargeting of ERGIC-53 to the ER impairs the secretion of cathepsin C (18Vollenweider F. Kappeler F. Itin C. Hauri H.-P. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 377-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), and mutations in ERGIC-53 can lead to combined factor V/VIII deficiency in humans presumably due to inefficient secretion of these coagulation factors (19Nicholls W.C. Seligsohn U. Zivelin A. Terry V.H. Hertel C.E. Wheatley M.A. Moussalli M.J. Hauri H.-P. Ciavarella N. Kaufman R.J. Ginsburg D. Cell. 1998; 93: 61-71Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). Targeting of ERGIC-53 is controlled by at least three signals. In addition to the dilysine signal the two C-terminal phenylalanines operate as an ER exit determinant (20Kappeler F. Klopfenstein D.R. Foguet M. Paccaud J.P. Hauri H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31801-31808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Moreover, the luminal and transmembrane domains of ERGIC-53 in combination contain information for intracellular retention that is abolished by exchanging the transmembrane domain of ERGIC-53 by that of the plasma membrane protein CD4 (20Kappeler F. Klopfenstein D.R. Foguet M. Paccaud J.P. Hauri H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31801-31808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). If the two C-terminal phenylalanines are changed to alanines, resulting in the C-terminal sequence KKAA, ERGIC-53 is mislocalized to the ER (20Kappeler F. Klopfenstein D.R. Foguet M. Paccaud J.P. Hauri H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31801-31808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 21Itin C. Schindler R. Hauri H.P. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 57-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Although the most straightforward interpretation of this finding is that the replacement of the two phenylalanines inactivates the ER exit signal, an alternative possibility is that the dilysine signal KKAA mediates direct retention in the ER. To test for retention, we have transferred the KKAA dilysine signal to a plasma membrane reporter protein, CD4, that is known not to carry intracellular retention information. Here we show that chimeric proteins possessing the C-terminal dilysine signal KKAA are permanently retained in the ER, in contrast to KKFF chimeras that can leave the ER. The results suggest that dilysine signals can operate in both ER retention and retrieval. DISCUSSIONIt is currently assumed that dilysine targeting signals operate by retrieval rather than retention (1Teasdale R.D. Jackson M.R. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 27-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). This notion is based on the findings that chimeras bearing some dilysine signals carry Golgi-specific carbohydrate modifications despite their localization to the ER both in mammalian and yeast cells (2Jackson M.R. Nilsson T. Peterson P.A. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3153-3162Crossref PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar, 3Gaynor E.C. te Heesen S. Graham T.R. Aebi M. Emr S.D. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 653-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 4Jackson M.R. Nilsson T. Peterson P.A. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 317-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar).Surprisingly, we were unable to find evidence for recycling of chimeric proteins with a C-terminal KKAA dilysine signal. These chimeras localized to the ER, did not acquire Golgi-dependent endo-D sensitivity in Lec1 cells, were not concentrated in the ERGIC by AlF4−, and were excluded from ER-derived transport vesicles. These data strongly support the notion that KKAA is a true ER retention signal. ER retention is not simply due to the lack of an ER-export signal because chimeras with a polyalanine tail lacking transport information were not retained. Moreover, the inactivation of an ER exit signal does not entirely block ER exit (20Kappeler F. Klopfenstein D.R. Foguet M. Paccaud J.P. Hauri H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31801-31808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar,32Nishimura N. Balch W.E. Science. 1997; 277: 556-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). It has previously been noted that the rate at which various dilysine signal-tagged reporter proteins acquired Golgi modifications greatly varied, as did the degree to which they co-localized to post-ER compartments (4Jackson M.R. Nilsson T. Peterson P.A. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 317-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). It was therefore proposed that the sequence context of a dilysine motif may affect the efficiency of retrieval (1Teasdale R.D. Jackson M.R. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 27-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). Our data with KKAA suggest retention as an additional function of dilysine signals, whereby the sequence context of dilysine signals determines the efficiency of ER retention. Although it is likely that the sequence context also affects the efficiency of protein retrieval, this issue remains to be reinvestigated in light of our present findings.What is the mechanism by which KKAA mediates ER retention? Previous transfection experiments in COS cells have shown that the intracellular retention of ERGIC-53 and CD4 chimeras carrying the wild type KKFF signal is saturable by overexpression very much in contrast to that of ERGIC-53 terminating in KKAA (21Itin C. Schindler R. Hauri H.P. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 57-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 33Kappeler F. Itin C. Schindler R. Hauri H.-P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6279-6281Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It was of interest therefore to determine whether COP I known to specifically recognize dilysine signals plays a role in the ER retention mediated by the KKAA signal. Although the KKAA signal avidly binds COP I in vitro (20Kappeler F. Klopfenstein D.R. Foguet M. Paccaud J.P. Hauri H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31801-31808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar) and COP I has be localized to some areas of the ER (34Orci L. Perrelet A. Ravazzola M. Amherdt M. Rothman J.E. Schekman R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11924-11928Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), our results with the ε-COP-deficient ldlF cells suggest that intact coatomer is not required for ER retention. Unlike CD4R2A10 the KKAA protein did not acquire cis-Golgi-specific carbohydrate modifications in these cells at the nonpermissive temperature. Under these conditions coatomer of ldlF cells is unable to bind to the dilysine signal. 2M. Gomez, personal communication. These data are in line with the notion that COP I is primarily involved in retrograde transport (11Letourneur F. Gaynor E.C. Hennecke S. Demolliere C. Duden R. Emr S.D. Riezman H. Cosson P. Cell. 1994; 79: 1199-1207Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar), although other traffic routes may also depend on coatomer. Another possibility for retention would be tight interaction of the KKAA signal with microtubules. Studies with a synthetic peptide containing the dilysine signal of the adenovirus E19 protein indicate that this peptide can bind β-tubulin and promote tubulin polymerization in vitro (35Dahllof B. Wallin M. Kvist S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1804-1808Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, if microtubules were destroyed by nocodazole, KKAA-mediated ER retention was not affected, 3H. Andersson and H.-P. Hauri, unpublished observations. rendering such a mechanism less likely. Yet another notion for protein retention in a membrane organelle is the formation of oligomers too large to be included into transport vesicles (36Munro S. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 11-15Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Such a mechanism appears unlikely because CD4 is a monomer and KKAA-bearing ERGIC-53 oligomerizes with normal kinetics and no such large aggregates were observed (Ref. 21Itin C. Schindler R. Hauri H.P. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 57-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar and this study). Interaction with an ER resident protein appears a likely possibility for explaining the ER retention, although our attempts to identify such a partner protein were unsuccessful. Interaction with ER-specific lipids is another possibility that remains to be tested.In conclusion, we have shown that the dilysine signal KKAA mediates permanent retention of type I membrane proteins in the ER. We propose that dilysine ER targeting signals can mediate retention in addition to retrieval. Thus protein targeting to the ER by dilysine signals can be mediated by at least two mechanisms that are not mutually exclusive: signal-mediated retention and signal-mediated retrieval. It is currently assumed that dilysine targeting signals operate by retrieval rather than retention (1Teasdale R.D. Jackson M.R. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev.

A great deal of effort has been made to clarify this issue, using mainlyin vitro systems. In most such experiments, it has been found that Aβ at much higher concentrations than those prevailing in biological fluids is needed for Aβ aggregation. Thus, it has been hypothesized that aggregation of soluble Aβ involves seeded polymerization (4Lansbury Jr., P.T. Neuron. 1997; 19: 1151-1154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 5Harper J.D. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 385-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (1412) Google Scholar), although this assumption has not yet been provedin vivo. We have recently reported the detection of a novel Aβ in the apical compartment of cultures of MDCK cells that had been stably transfected with APP cDNA (ΔC MDCK cell) with a truncated cytoplasmic domain (ΔC APP) (3Mizuno T. Haass C. Michikawa M. Yanagisawa K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1373: 119-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). This Aβ species possesses unique molecular characteristics including its appearance as a smear on immunoblots and altered immunoreactivity. Significantly, these molecular characteristics disappeared dramatically following treatment of the cells with compactin or filipin, an inhibitor of de novocholesterol synthesis and a cholesterol-binding drug, respectively. Based on previously reported evidence for ΔC APP being missorted to the apical surface (6Haass C. Koo E.H. Capell A. Teplow D.B. Selkoe D.J. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 537-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) and the cholesterol concentrations of the apical plasma membrane and apical transport vesicles being higher than those in other cellular membranes (7Van A. Meer G. FEBS Lett. 1995; 369: 18-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), we concluded that a novel Aβ is generated from apically missorted APP in a cholesterol-dependent manner. Regarding the involvement of cellular cholesterol in the generation of the pathogenic protein, it must be noted that cholesterol-rich lipid microdomains within cells, called caveolae-like domains, have been reported to be the likely sites of the conversion of the normal cellular form of prion protein (PrPc) to its pathogenic form (PrPsc) (8Vey M.

To determine the integrity of the cell monolayers that grew on the filters, measurement of the electric resistance between the apical and basolateral compartments of the MDCK cell culture was performed by immersing electrodes into each of the compartments. The MDCK cells culture media were changed 3 days after plating, and the cells were cultured 24 h longer. Thioflavin T assay was performed as described elsewhere (13Naiki H. Gejyo F. Nakakuki K. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6243-6250Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), on a spectrofluorophotometer (RF-5300PC, Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan). Optimum fluorescence measurements of amyloid fibrils were obtained at the excitation and emission wavelength of 446 nm and 490 nm, respectively, with the reaction mixture (1.0 ml) containing 5 μm thioflavin T (Nakalai tesque, Inc., Kyoto, Japan) and 50 mm of glycine-NaOH buffer, pH 8.5. Fluorescence was measured immediately after making the mixture and averaged for an initial 5 s. Synthetic Aβ (Aβ1–40, Bachem Switzerland) was initially dissolved in ice-cold distilled water at a concentration of 100, 200, and 300 μm, and then diluted with 9 volumes of PBS. Aliquots of the Aβ solutions were incubated in Eppendorf tubes at 37 °C. Every hour after the start of incubation, 10 μl of the solution of synthetic Aβ was taken and mixed with 990 μl of the reaction mixture. The lot number of the Aβ used in the experiment of Fig. 1 was 518765 and that of the Aβ used in the other experiments was 510313. Peak fluorescence was dependent on the concentration of Aβ. We used 20 μm Aβ peptide for this study. Congo red assay was performed as described elsewhere (14Choo-Smith L.-P. Garzon-Rodriguez W. Glabe C.G. Surewicz W.K. J. Biol.

Samples were spread on carbon-coated grids, negatively stained with 1% phosphotungstic acid, pH 7.0, then examined under a Hitachi H-7000 electron microscope with an acceleration voltage of 75 kV. The enzyme immunoassay (EIA) was performed essentially as described previously (3Mizuno T. Haass C. Michikawa M. Yanagisawa K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1373: 119-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 15Suzuki N. Iwatsubo T. Odaka A. Ishibashi Y. Kitada C. Ihara Y. Am. J. Pathol. 1994; 145: 452-460PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 100 μl of the media of the MDCK cell cultures were diluted with 400 μl of buffer C (20 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.0), 0.4m NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 10% Block Ace (Dai-nippon, Tokyo, Japan), 0.2% bovine serum albumin, and 0.05% NaN3), and 100 μl of the mixture were subjected to the multiwell plates coated with 4G8, a monoclonal antibody specific for Aβ17–24 (16Kim K.S. Miller D.L. Sapienza V.J. Chen C.-M.J. Bai C. Grundke-Iqbal I. Currie J.R. Wisniewski H.M. Neurosci. Res. Commun. 1988; 2: 121-130Google Scholar). Appropriate amounts of synthetic Aβ40 (Aβ1–40, Bachem Switzerland) were applied to the multiwell plates for the construction of a standard curve. The plates were incubated at 4 °C overnight. After rinsing with PBS, loaded wells were reacted with appropriately diluted horseradish peroxidase-conjugated BA27, a monoclonal antibody specific for Aβ40, at 4 °C overnight. Bound enzyme activities were measured using the TMB Microwell peroxidase substrate system (Kirkegaard and Perry Laboratories, Gaithersburg, MD). Aliquots (1.5 ml) of the medium from the transfected MDCK cell cultures were incubated with 4G8 (1.5 μg) at 4 °C overnight for Aβ immunoprecipitation 3 days after changing the medium. The mixtures were then incubated with protein G-Sepharose at 4 °C for 3 h and centrifuged. The pellets were washed thoroughly in RIPA buffer once, and then in Tris-saline buffer four times. The Aβ in the immunoprecipitates was extracted in 25 μl of a buffer containing 2% SDS by boiling. Following dilution with 975 μl of Tris-saline buffer, 5 μl of the solution (containing 1 pmol of the immunoprecipitated Aβ) was mixed with 10 μl of the synthetic Aβ solution (containing 2 nmol of Aβ1–40) and 85 μl of PBS buffer. The level of the immunoprecipitated Aβ was determined by enzyme immunoassay (data not shown), and the molecular ratio between synthetic Aβ and the immunoprecipitated Aβ was approximately 2,000:1. Amyloid fibril formation of synthetic Aβ was quantitatively determined by measuring fluorescence intensity at 2 and 6 h after starting the incubation as described before. The background fluorescence intensity was determined using an extract of protein G-Sepharose that was incubated with 4G8 in fresh medium. To inhibitde novo cholesterol synthesis, MDCK cells were incubated for 90 min with compactin (Sigma), a potent competitive inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase activity, at concentrations of 0.5 and 1.0 μm, before changing the media to fresh ones. The cells were further cultured for 3 days with compactin, and then 1.5-ml aliquots of the medium from the apical and basolateral compartments of the culture were used for immunoprecipitation. MDCK cells were cultured in medium containing filipin (Sigma), a polyene antibiotic that specifically binds to cholesterol, at concentrations of 0.1 and 0.3 μg/ml for 90 min before changing the media to fresh ones. The cells were further cultured for 3 days with filipin, and then 1.5-ml aliquots of the medium from the apical and basolateral compartments of the culture were used for immunoprecipitation. To confirm that the seeding ability of the apical Aβ depends on the presence of cholesterol, we investigated whether the effect of compactin and filipin was reversed by the addition of exogenous free cholesterol. To determine the total level of cellular cholesterol in MDCK cells, cultures treated with compactin (1 μm) or filipin (0.3 μg/ml) for 2 days were washed 3 times in PBS and dried at room temperature. The samples were extracted with hexane/isopropanol (3:2 v/v) and dried with nitrogen. The total cholesterol levels in the samples were determined using a cholesterol determination kit (Kyowa Medical Co. Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). Protein concentration was determined using the BCA protein assay kit (Pierce), with bovine serum albumin as the standard. To determine the level of de novo cholesterol synthesis, MDCK cells were pretreated with compactin (1 μm) and filipin (0.3 μg/ml) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum for 2 h. 2 μCi/ml [14C]acetate was added into the cultures treated with the compounds. After 3 h of incubation, the cultures were washed three times in PBS and dried at room temperature. The samples were then extracted with hexane/isopropanol (3:2 v/v) and dried with nitrogen. The samples were quantitatively spotted on thin-layer chromatography plates and developed in a solvent system of hexane/ethyl ether/acetic acid (80:30:1). The radioactivities of the spots were detected and quantified by the Bio-imaging Analyzer System-2500 Mac (Fuji Film Co. Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). Mass spectrometric analysis was performed essentially as described elsewhere (17Wang R. Sweeney D. Gandy S.E. Sisodia S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31894-31902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Aliquots of medium (5 ml) from the apical and basolateral compartments were incubated with 4G8 (5 μg) at 4 °C overnight for immunoprecipitation of Aβ. The mixtures were then incubated with protein G-Sepharose at 4 °C for 3 h and centrifuged. The pellets were washed thoroughly with RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% deoxycholic acid, 1.0% Nonidet P-40) once and then with distilled water four times. The immunoprecipitated Aβ was extracted with 10 μl of trifluoroacetic acid. 1 μl of the extracted solution was mixed with 10 μl of UV-laser desorption matrix (trifluoroacetic acid/water/acetonitrile (1:20:20, v/v/v), containing saturated α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid; 0.5 μl of this mixture was loaded onto the mass spectrometer sample probe and dried at room temperature. Mass spectra were measured using a UV-laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometer (Voyager Elite, PerSeptive Biosystem). MDCK cells were cultured as described previously (6Haass C. Koo E.H. Capell A. Teplow D.B. Selkoe D.J. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 537-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Stable transfection of these cells with APP cDNA was performed as described elsewhere (12Haass C. Koo E.H. Teplow D.E. Selkoe D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1564-1568Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). To investigate whether the novel Aβ in the medium of the apical compartment of the ΔC MDCK cell cultures, referred to as apical Aβ, potentially accelerates amyloid fibril formation of synthetic Aβ, we performed a thioflavin T assay as described previously (13Naiki H. Gejyo F. Nakakuki K. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6243-6250Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), using the Aβ peptide immunoprecipitated from the conditioned media. As shown in Fig. 1a, when synthetic Aβ (Aβ1–40) was incubated with the apical Aβ derived from the ΔC MDCK cells, the fluorescence increased without a lag phase and proceeded to equilibrium hyperbolically. This time-course curve suggests that the apical Aβ acts as a seed in this experiment. A perfect linear semilogarithmic plot (r = 0.998) shown in Fig. 1b, indicates that F(t) satisfies a differential equation: F′(t) =B − CF(t), where Band C are constants (18Naiki H. Nakakuki K. Lab. Invest. 1996; 74: 374-383PubMed Google Scholar). Based on this differential equation, amyloid fibril formation from synthetic Aβ incubated with the apical Aβ can be explained by a first-order kinetic model;i.e. the extention of amyloid fibrils may proceed via the consecutive association of synthetic Aβ first onto the apical Aβ then onto the ends of growing fibrils (18Naiki H. Nakakuki K. Lab. Invest. 1996; 74: 374-383PubMed Google Scholar). Electron microscopic analysis showed the formation of typical amyloid fibrils with a diameter of approximately 10 nm and helical structure (Fig. 1c, left panel). Similar helical filament structure was observed when 400 μm of synthetic Aβ (Aβ1–40) was incubated at pH 7.5, 37 °C for 3 days (18Naiki H. Nakakuki K. Lab. Invest. 1996; 74: 374-383PubMed Google Scholar). When synthetic Aβ was incubated with other types of immunoprecipitated Aβ, the increase in the fluorescence was small and no fibrillar structures were observed with electron microscopic analysis (Fig. 1,a and c, right panel). Accelerated fibrillogenesis upon addition of the apical Aβ was further confirmed using Congo red assay (data not shown). The extent of enhancement of fibrillogenesis by the apical Aβ was statistically significant (Fig. 2a). We excluded the possibility that these results were caused by alteration in the amount of Aβ secreted from the cells by determining the level of Aβ by enzyme immunoassay (Fig. 2b). To investigate the molecular mechanism of generation of the apical Aβ with seeding ability, we first asked whether the generation is dependent on the cellular cholesterol because the level of cholesterol in the apical plasma membrane is higher than that of basolateral plasma membrane (7Van A. Meer G. FEBS Lett. 1995; 369: 18-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). When we incubated the cells with compactin or filipin, acceleration of fibrillogenesis upon addition of the apical Aβ was substantially inhibited in a dose-dependent manner as shown in Fig. 3a. Again, we excluded the possibility that these results were caused by alteration in the amount of Aβ secreted from the cells by determining the level of Aβ by enzyme immunoassay (Fig. 3b). To further confirm that the seeding ability of the apical Aβ depended on the presence of cholesterol, we performed an experiment to see if the effect of compactin and filipin was reversed by the addition of exogenous cholesterol. As shown in Fig. 3c, the inhibition of the apical Aβ-induced acceleration of fibrillogenesis of synthetic Aβ following treatment with compactin and filipin, was dramatically reduced by the addition of exogenous cholesterol. Total cellular level of cholesterol was not dramatically decreased in cultures treated with compactin or altered at all in those treated with filipin, whereas thede novo cholesterol synthesis was markedly suppressed in cultures treated with compactin (Fig. 3d). These results suggest that generation of the seeding Aβ requires the presence of cholesterol in specific microdomains and does not depend on the total cellular level of cholesterol. The altered Aβ species was also generated in cultures that were grown in media not containing fetal bovine serum or supplemented with lipoprotein-deprived serum (data not shown), indicating that its generation does not depend on the presence of lipoprotein(s) or other factors in the serum. We then attempted to characterize the novel SDS-stable Aβ species. It was previously reported that Aβ can form SDS-stable oligomers (19Podlisny M.B. Ostaszewski B.L. Squazzo S.L. Koo E.H. Rydel R.E. Teplow D.B. Selkoe D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9564-9570Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar); thus, we attempted to determine its molecular mass using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry. The molecular mass of the major peak for the apical Aβ was identical to that of human Aβ6–40 peptide (Fig. 4a), whereas that of the Aβ immunoprecipitated from the media of the basolateral compartment was identical to the molecular mass of Aβ5–40 (data not shown), which is consistent with a previous report (12Haass C. Koo E.H. Teplow D.E. Selkoe D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1564-1568Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Notably, the molecular mass of the apical Aβ did not change following treatment of the cells with compactin (Fig. 4b), whereas its smearing on the immunoblot was lost following compactin treatment (data not shown) as described previously (3Mizuno T. Haass C. Michikawa M. Yanagisawa K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1373: 119-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). To exclude the possibility of a different Aβ species being extracted in the experiment of mass spectrometry because of a difference in the used extracting buffer, we performed Western blotting analysis of the immunoprecipitates extracted with trifluoroacetic acid, which was used for the mass spectrometric study, but the smear appearance persisted (data not shown). This result indicates that the acquisition of these unique molecular characteristics by the apical Aβ is not due to the association of the Aβ with other molecules, but rather because of some conformational alteration. This assumption is also supported by our previous finding that the altered immunoreactivity of this novel Aβ was restored by treatment of the cells with compactin (3Mizuno T. Haass C. Michikawa M. Yanagisawa K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1373: 119-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Furthermore, formic acid treatment of the apical Aβ abolished its ability to act as a seed (data not shown). Here we report, for the first time, that a seeding Aβ, which catalyzes the fibrillogenesis of soluble Aβ, is endogenously generated in cell culture. A noteworthy finding in this study is that generation of the seeding Aβ depends exclusively on the presence of cholesterol as shown in Fig. 3, a and c. Determination of the intracellular site of the generation of the seeding Aβ remains to be determined; however, lipid microdomains, called rafts (20Simon K. Ikonen E. Nature. 1997; 387: 569-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (8091) Google Scholar), sharing a high content of cholesterol and glycosphingolipid with caveolae or caveolae-like domains are likely to be the best candidate for the following reasons: first, the axonally sorted APP, analogous to apically sorted APP in epithelial cells, is conveyed via caveolae-like domains in neurons (21Bouillot C. Prochiantz A. Rougon G. Allinquant B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7640-7644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar); second, localization of APP in caveolae has recently been reported (22Ikezu T. Trapp B.D. Song K.S. Schlegel A. Lisanti M.P. Okamoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10485-10495Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar); third, further evidence to support the generation of Aβ in the cholesterol-rich microdomains is accumulating (23Simons M. Keller P. De Strooper B. Beyreuther K. Dotti C.G. Simons K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6460-6464Crossref PubMed Scopus (1082) Google Scholar, 24Lee S.J. Liyanage U. Bickel P.E. Xia W. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Kosik KS. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 730-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). At this point, it is extremely difficult to elucidate the molecular mechanism of acquisition by the apical Aβ of its unique molecular characteristics, including its seeding ability; however, it may be reasonable to assume that the apical Aβ adopts an altered conformation based on the following experimental results obtained from this and previous studies (3Mizuno T. Haass C. Michikawa M. Yanagisawa K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1373: 119-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar): first, the immunoreactivity of the apical Aβ to BAN50, in addition to its smearing behavior on gel electrophoresis, changed following treatment of the cells with compactin without any alteration in its mass number (Ref. 3Mizuno T. Haass C. Michikawa M. Yanagisawa K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1373: 119-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar and Fig. 4); second, the BAN50 immunoreactivity for the apical Aβ recovered following treatment of the Aβ with formic acid (3Mizuno T. Haass C. Michikawa M. Yanagisawa K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1373: 119-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In the putative conformational alteration of the apical Aβ, auxiliary factors localized in the lipid microdomains may be involved, as is suggested in the conversion of the normal cellular form of prion protein (PrPc) to its pathogenic form (PrPsc) (9Kaneko K. Vey M. Scott M. Pilkuhn S. Cohen F.E. Prusiner S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2333-2338Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Among the candidates for such factors, we prefer to consider GM1 ganglioside for the following reasons: first, GM1 ganglioside is one of the main resident molecules in the microdomains (25Parton R.G. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1994; 42: 155-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar); second, we have previously found GM1 ganglioside-bound Aβ in human brains in the early stages of Alzheimer's disease (26Yanagisawa K. Odaka A. Suzuki N. Ihara Y. Nat. Med. 1995; 1: 1062-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar); third, Aβ undergoes alteration of its secondary structure via interaction with GM1 ganglioside (27McLaurin J. Chakrabartty A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26482-26489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar, 28Choo-Smith L.-P. Surewicz W.K. FEBS Lett. 1997; 402: 95-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar); and fourth, it has recently been reported that amyloid fibril formation of Aβ is drastically accelerated in the presence of GM1 ganglioside (14Choo-Smith L.-P. Garzon-Rodriguez W. Glabe C.G. Surewicz W.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22987-22990Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). Thus, it is intriguing to speculate that the Aβ generated from the apically missorted APP undergoes conformational alteration via association with GM1 ganglioside in the lipid microdomains and then acts as a template for the consecutive conversion of a nascent soluble Aβ into a seeding Aβ. Recently, much attention has been focused on the conformational alteration of constitutive proteins in the brain in various neurodegenerative diseases (4Lansbury Jr., P.T. Neuron. 1997; 19: 1151-1154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 5Harper J.D. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 385-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (1412) Google Scholar, 29Carrell R.W. Lomas D.A. Lancet. 1997; 350: 134-138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (812) Google Scholar). In such processes, a constitutive protein in the brain undergoes minor perturbations of structure, leading to an increase in β-sheet content; it has been proposed that these disease processes be grouped into one new category, the conformational diseases (29Carrell R.W. Lomas D.A. Lancet. 1997; 350: 134-138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (812) Google Scholar). Conformational conversion of the prion protein with resultant aggregation of its pathogenic form is a well-known example belonging to this category (30Prusiner S.B. Science. 1997; 278: 245-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (857) Google Scholar). Although Alzheimer's disease could also be included in the conformational diseases group (4Lansbury Jr., P.T. Neuron. 1997; 19: 1151-1154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 5Harper J.D. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 385-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (1412) Google Scholar, 29Carrell R.W. Lomas D.A. Lancet. 1997; 350: 134-138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (812) Google Scholar), to date, no study has ever shown the generation of a conformationally altered isoform of Aβ with seeding ability. In this regard, our results present, for the first time, evidence for the generation of a seeding Aβ in cell culture, and furthermore, may be used to explain the molecular mechanism underlying initiation of amyloid fibril formation in vivo. Finally, from the results of this and other (31De Strooper B. Craessaerts K. Dewachter I. Moechars D. Greenberg B. Van Leuven F. Van den Berghe H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4058-4065Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) studies, one can consider the possibility that missorting of APP or altered intracellular trafficking of Aβ plays a role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. Further studies, using polarized differentiated neurons should be carried out to investigate the consequences of generation of a seeding Aβ from axonal or presynaptic membranes. The authors thank Y. Hanai for preparing this manuscript and I. Yamaguchi for technical support in the electron microscopic analysis."

Previous studies with deletion mutants have shown that the membrane-proximal cytoplasmic domain of the receptor is sufficient for mitogenic signaling, whereas the membrane-distal domain is required for differentiation signaling. However, the function of the four cytoplasmic tyrosines of the G-CSF-R in the control of proliferation, differentiation, and survival has remained unclear. Here we investigated the role of these tyrosines by expressing a tyrosine “null” mutant and single tyrosine “add back” mutants in maturation-competent myeloid 32D cells. Clones expressing the null mutant showed only minimal proliferation and differentiation, with survival also reduced at low G-CSF concentrations. Analysis of clones expressing the add-back mutants revealed that multiple tyrosines contribute to proliferation, differentiation, and survival signals from the G-CSF-R. Analysis of signaling pathways downstream of these tyrosines suggested a positive role for STAT3 activation in both differentiation and survival signaling, whereas SHP-2, Grb2 and Shc appear important for proliferation signaling. In addition, we show that a tyrosine-independent “differentiation domain” in the membrane-distal region of the G-CSF-R appears necessary but not sufficient for mediating neutrophilic differentiation in these cells.

The production of blood cells is regulated by a range of extracellular stimuli, including a network of hematopoietic growth factors and cytokines. One of these, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), 1The abbreviations used are: G-CSF-R, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor receptor; STAT, signal transducer and activator of transcription; SH2, Src homology 2; WT, wild type; IL-3, interleukin 3; TBST, Tris-buffered saline-Tween; GAP, GTPase-activating protein. is a major regulator of neutrophilic granulocyte production and augments the proliferation, survival, maturation, and functional activation of cells of the granulocytic lineage (1Nicola N.A.

Typical of other members of the hematopoietin receptor superfamily, the G-CSF-R has no intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity but activates cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases (2Demetri G.D. Griffin J.D.

The cytoplasmic region of the G-CSF-R can be subdivided into a membrane-proximal domain, which contains two conserved subdomains known as box 1 and box 2, and a membrane-distal domain, which contains a less-conserved box 3 sequence (5Fukunaga R.

In addition, there are four tyrosine (Tyr) residues in the cytoplasmic region of the G-CSF-R, at positions 704, 729, 744, and 764 of the human receptor, three of which lie in the membrane-distal domain (28Fukunaga R.

Some signaling pathways emanating from the different tyrosines of the G-CSF-R have been identified. For example, we and others have shown that Tyr-704 and Tyr-744 of the G-CSF-R are involved in the recruitment and activation of STAT3 by the G-CSF-R (15Nicholson S.E. Starr R. Novak U. Hilton D.J.

In addition, Tyr-764 is necessary for the formation of Shc/Grb2/p140 complexes as well as the activation of p21 ras (22de Koning J.P. Schelen A.M. Dong F. van Buitenen C. Burgering B.M. Bos J.L.

However, studies to determine the role of each of the four cytoplasmic tyrosines in mediating the effects of G-CSF on proliferation, differentiation, and survival have yielded ambiguous and somewhat conflicting results (15Nicholson S.E.

Immunol. 1998; 160: 4979-4987PubMed Google Scholar). To better define the role of receptor tyrosines in signaling from the G-CSF-R, we examined the ability of a tyrosine null mutant and a series of single tyrosine add back mutants to transduce biological signals in response to G-CSF. Furthermore, we performed these studies in maturation-competent myeloid 32D cells, which are able to closely recapitulate many of the cellular responses to G-CSF, including proliferation, survival, and, importantly, terminal differentiation into mature neutrophils (27Dong F. Brynes R.K. Tidow N. Welte K. Lowenberg B. Touw I.P. N. Engl. J. Med. 1995; 333: 487-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). Thus, 32D cells provide an appropriate cellular context to assess the physiological relevance of signals from the G-CSF-R. This analysis revealed that multiple tyrosines contribute to proliferation, differentiation, and survival signaling from the human G-CSF-R. Analysis of signaling pathways downstream from these tyrosines suggest a positive role for STAT3 activation in both differentiation and survival, whereas SHP-2, Grb2, and Shc appear important for proliferation. In addition, we show that a tyrosine-independent “differentiation domain” in the membrane-distal region of the G-CSF-R appears necessary, although not sufficient, for mediating neutrophilic differentiation in 32D cells. The pLNCX expression constructs of human G-CSF-R wild-type (WT), a series of triple Tyr → Phe add back mutants (mA, mB, mC, and mD), a quadruple Tyr → Phe null mutant (mO), and a truncation mutant derived from a patient with severe congenital neutropenia (mDA) have been described previously (18Ward A.C.

Engl. J. Med. 1995; 333: 487-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). A subline of the IL-3-dependent murine myeloid cell line 32D.cl3, called 32D.cl8.6, which lacked endogenous G-CSF-R expression but remained maturation-competent, was generated as described previously (27Dong F. Brynes R.K. Tidow N. Welte K. Lowenberg B. Touw I.P. N. Engl. J. Med. 1995; 333: 487-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). This was maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 10 ng/ml murine IL-3. The expression constructs were linearized by PvuI digestion and transfected into 32D.cl8.6 cells by electroporation. After 48 h of incubation, cells were selected with G418 (Life Technologies, Inc.) at a concentration of 0.8 mg/ml. Multiple clones were expanded for further analysis. To check G-CSF-R expression levels, cells were incubated at room temperature for 60 min with 10 μg/ml biotinylated mouse anti-human G-CSF-R monoclonal antibody LMM741 (PharMingen, San Diego, CA), then at 4 °C for 60 min sequentially with 5 μg/ml phycoerythrin-conjugated streptavidin, 5 μg/ml biotinylated anti-streptavidin antibody, and finally 2 μg/ml phycoerythrin-conjugated streptavidin, with washing between each antibody step. Samples were analyzed by flow cytometry using a FACScan (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA). Several independently derived cell lines of each construct were selected on the basis of equivalent receptor expression. To determine the proliferation and differentiation characteristics of 32D.cl8.6 clones, cells were incubated at an initial density of 1–2 × 105 cells/ml in RPMI medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and either 100 ng/ml human G-CSF, 10 ng/ml of murine IL-3, or without growth factors. The medium was replenished every 1–2 days, and the cell densities were adjusted to 1–2 × 105cells/ml. Viable cells were counted on the basis of trypan blue exclusion. To analyze the morphological features, cells were spun onto glass slides and examined by May-Grünwald-Giemsa staining. To quantify the neutrophilic maturation of 32D.cl8.6 transfectants in response to G-CSF, the number of terminally differentiated cells was determined and expressed as a percentage of total living cells (% neutrophils). Cells were deprived of serum and factors for 4 h at 37 °C in RPMI 1640 medium at a density of 1 × 106/ml and then stimulated with either RPMI 1640 medium alone or in the presence of 100 ng/ml human G-CSF. At different time points, 10 volumes of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with 10 μmNa3VO4 were added. Subsequently, cells were pelleted and lysed by incubation for 30 min at 4 °C in Tyr(P) lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 100 mm NaCl, 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm Pefabloc SC, 50 μg/ml aprotinin, 50 μg/ml leupeptin, 50 μg/ml bacitracin) followed by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 15 min. The soluble proteins were mixed with sample buffer, separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis), and transferred onto nitrocellulose (0.2 μm; Schleicher & Schuell). Filters were blocked by incubation in TBST (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20) containing 0.6% (w/v) bovine serum albumin. Antibodies used for Western blotting were anti-phospho-STAT3[Y705] (New England Biolabs, Inc. Beverly, MA), anti-phospho-STAT3[S727] (New England Biolabs), and anti-STAT3 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) and were diluted in TBST containing 0.6% (w/v) bovine serum albumin. After washing with TBST, immune complexes were detected with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated species-specific antiserum (DAKO, Glostrup, Denmark) followed by enhanced chemiluminescence reaction (DuPont). In some instances, membranes were stripped in 62.5 mmTris-HCl, pH 6.7, 2% SDS, and 100 mm β-mercaptoethanol at 50 °C for 30 min, reblocked, washed, and reprobed. The cytoplasmic domain of the human G-CSF-R was cloned into pET-15b (Novagen, Madison, WI) as described (18Ward A.C. Hermans M.H.A. Smith L. van Aesch Y.M. Schelen A.M. Antonissen C. Touw I.P. Blood. 1999; 93: 113-124Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, the following glutathione S-transferase fusion constructs were made utilizing standard polymerase chain reaction protocols to amplify the appropriate coding regions, which were cloned into pGEX-2T (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech): Grb2-FL (SH3-SH2-SH3), Grb2-FL(mut) (SH3-SH2mutant-SH3), Shc-SH2, SHP-1-SH2(N), SHP-1-SH2(C), SHP-2-SH2(N), SHP-2-SH2(C), Syk-SH2(N), and Syk-SH2(C). The authenticity of all constructs was verified by DNA sequencing. In addition, constructs were obtained for the production of glutathioneS-transferase fusions with GAP-SH2(N) and GAP-SH2(C) from Tony Pawson, Vav-SH2 and Fps-SH2 from Lewis Cantley, CrkL-SH2 and Abl-SH2 from Wallace Langdon, and Grb14-SH2 from Roger Daly. For the production of tyrosine-phosphorylated G-CSF-R cytoplasmic domain, the pET clone was introduced into the E. coli strain TKB1 (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), which contains an inducible tyrosine kinase. Fusion protein was produced and purified according to the manufacturer's instructions, then 32P-labeled using heart muscle kinase. For the production of glutathioneS-transferase fusions, plasmids were transformed into XL-1 Blue (Stratagene), with proteins expressed and purified on glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads as described (35Ward A.C.

These proteins were then electrophoresed on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gels (36Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) and electrophoretically transferred to Hybond-C membranes (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The membranes were processed through a denaturation-renaturation cycle (37Vinson C.R. LaMarco K.L. Johnson P.F. Landschulz W.H. McKnight S.L. Genes Dev. 1988; 2: 801-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar) and probed with the32P-labeled G-CSF-R, as described (38Kaelin Jr., W.G. Krek W. Sellers W.R. DeCaprio J.A. Ajchenbaum F.

The contribution of receptor tyrosines to G-CSF-R function has remained unclear (15Nicholson S.E. Starr R. Novak U. Hilton D.J. Layton J.E. J. Biol.

Therefore, to better understand the role of these tyrosines, we analyzed a quadruple Tyr → Phe or null mutant with no cytoplasmic tyrosines (mO) and a series of triple Tyr → Phe or add back mutants, which each retain a single cytoplasmic tyrosine (mA, mB, mC, and mD). Expression vectors encoding these mutant receptors along with WT and truncated (mDA) G-CSF-Rs (Fig. 1A) were introduced into a subline of the IL-3-dependent murine myeloid cell line 32D.cl3 called 32D.cl8.6 that does not express endogenous G-CSF-R. Surface expression of the G-CSF-R was determined using fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis, and cell lines expressing equivalent levels of receptor were selected for further analysis, with at least three independent clones studied for each construct. Examples of clones expressing WT or mutant G-CSF-R proteins are shown in Fig. 1B. To ascertain whether receptor tyrosines were required at all to mediate proliferation, survival, and differentiation responses in response to G-CSF in 32D cells, we first compared the WT and tyrosine null mutant (mO) G-CSF-Rs. To this end, 32D[WT] and 32D[mO] transfectants were switched from IL-3- to G-CSF-containing medium following extensive washing to remove any traces of IL-3. In the absence of IL-3 or G-CSF, all transfectants died within 1 to 2 days without showing any signs of differentiation. However, in response to 100 ng/ml G-CSF, 32D[WT] cells showed transient proliferation for 5 to 7 days (Fig. 2). After 6 to 10 days, 32D[WT] cells developed into terminally differentiated neutrophils, as shown by an increased cytoplasm-to-nucleus ratio, a neutrophilic granule-containing cytoplasm, and lobulated nuclei (Fig. 3, A and B). In contrast, 32D[mO] cells showed only minimal proliferation and differentiation in response to G-CSF, although cell viability was largely maintained at this saturating ligand concentration (Figs. 2 and3). This result establishes that receptor tyrosines are required to facilitate proliferation and differentiation responses from the full-length G-CSF-R.Figure 3Neutrophilic differentiation of 32D.cl8.6 transfectants in response to G-CSF.

This revealed that Tyr-704 alone (mA) could contribute to both G-CSF-mediated proliferation and differentiation signaling. This mutant elicited initial proliferation responses equivalent to those from the wild-type receptor, although the proliferative phase terminated slightly earlier. Concurrently, mA produced an earlier and more complete differentiation compared with the WT receptor. In contrast, Tyr-729 (mB) gave only a very weak signal for differentiation, with no significant increase in proliferation compared with the null mutant. The Tyr-744-containing mutant (mC) produced a phenotype similar to the Tyr-704-containing mA, although with slightly less proliferation and differentiation. Finally, analysis of 32D[mD] cells revealed that Tyr-764 projects strong proliferative signals, such that these cells continued to proliferate indefinitely on G-CSF, with no significant differentiation observed. We had previously identified the membrane-distal domain of the G-CSF-R as essential for the transduction of differentiation signals based on the observation that a truncation mutant isolated from a patient with severe congenital neutropenia, mDA, which lacks this domain, was unable to elicit differentiation in myeloid cells (19Ward A.C. van Aesch Y.M. Schelen A.M. Touw I.P. Blood. 1999; 93: 447-458Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Dong F. van Buitenen C. Pouwels K. Hoefsloot L.H. Lowenberg B. Touw I.P. Mol. Cell.

Med. 1995; 333: 487-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). The construction of mutant mA, which lacks all three tyrosines in this domain, allowed an assessment of whether tyrosines were required for these effects. Comparison of the 32D[mA] and 32D[mDA] clones revealed that the membrane-distal domain lacking all tyrosines still augments differentiation (Figs. 2 and 3). We have shown above that 32D[mO] cells are largely able to survive at 100 ng/ml G-CSF, without undergoing significant proliferation. In contrast, survival at lower G-CSF concentrations was impaired relative to 32D[WT] cells, such that 32D[WT] cells can survive on 0.1 ng/ml G-CSF, whereas 32D[mO] cells cannot (Fig. 4). We could then determine the contribution of individual tyrosines to this low dose G-CSF-mediated survival signaling by exposing clones to different concentrations of ligand. Results with the add-back mutants showed a strong role for Tyr-704 and Tyr-744 and a weak role for Tyr-729 in mediating survival, with Tyr-764 apparently having no role. This clearly parallels the effects of these tyrosines in mediating differentiation signals. The concordant pattern of survival at low doses of G-CSF and differentiation resembled that for STAT3 activation from the G-CSF-R, which we have recently reported in Ba/F3 cells (18Ward A.C. Hermans M.H.A. Smith L. van Aesch Y.M. Schelen A.M. Antonissen C. Touw I.P. Blood. 1999; 93: 113-124Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the various 32D cells clones, G-CSF-mediated STAT3 activation, as measured by both tyrosine and serine phosphorylation, was greatest with mA (Tyr-704) and mC (Tyr-744), with a lesser contribution from mB (Tyr-729) (Fig. 5). In contrast, mO was only weakly able to activate STAT3, whereas mD (Tyr-764) showed no more activation than mO. Thus, the ability of mutants to activate STAT3 showed a striking correlation with the strength of their respective differentiation and survival signals, suggesting a positive role for STAT3 in the control of both processes. Finally, we also sought to identify which signaling molecules might play a role in the tyrosine-mediated proliferation signaling from the G-CSF-R, i.e. via Tyr-704, Tyr-744, and Tyr-764. To achieve this we employed a novel strategy to identify SH2 domains that could interact directly with the phosphorylated tyrosines of the G-CSF-R. As an initial screen, we used a 32P-labeled, tyrosine-phosphorylated WT G-CSF-R cytoplasmic domain simulating an activated receptor to probe a range of SH2 domains immobilized on nitrocellulose (Fig. 6A). This showed that the isolated SH2 domains of SHP-2 and Shc could bind to the receptor. In addition, full-length Grb2 could bind to the receptor, whereas a specific SH2 domain mutant of Grb2 could not, implying that the Grb2 SH2 domain also interacts directly with the G-CSF-R. We were next able to map the specific tyrosine binding site(s) of these SH2 domains by probing them with tyrosine-phosphorylated receptor proteins generated from the single tyrosine add-back mutants (Fig. 6B). This revealed direct binding of SHP-2, preferentially via its N-terminal SH2 domain, to both Tyr-704 and Tyr-764, and Grb2 and Shc via their respective SH2 domains to Tyr-764. Because these tyrosines also elicit strong proliferation signals, we can posit a direct role for SHP-2, Grb2, and Shc in mediating these responses. No interactions of these molecules with Tyr-744 were identified. Previous studies to determine the role(s) of the cytoplasmic tyrosines of the G-CSF-R in eliciting cellular responses have been performed with deletion and single tyrosine substitution mutants. These studies have yielded ambiguous results. This is likely due, at least in part, to the use of inappropriate cell models, which are unable to recapitulate the complete gamut of G-CSF responses (15Nicholson S.E. Starr R. Novak U. Hilton D.J.

Analysis of single Tyr → Phe substitution mutants has provided some insight into the function of the receptor tyrosines, although even here the results are somewhat conflicting, implicating Tyr-44 and, to a lesser extent, Tyr-704 and Tyr-729 in the macrophage differentiation of M1 cells (15Nicholson S.E. Starr R. Novak U. Hilton D.J. Layton J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26947-26953Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), Tyr-703 or Tyr-728 of the murine G-CSF-R (equivalent to Tyr-704 and Tyr-729 of the human receptor) in the neutrophilic differentiation of L-GM-1 cells (29Yoshikawa A. Murakami H. Nagata S. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5288-5296Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), and Tyr-764 in the proliferative responses of 32D cells (33de Koning J.P. Soede-Bobok A.A. Schelen A.M. Smith L. van Leeuwen D. Santini V. Burgering B.M.T. Bos J.L. Lowenberg B. Touw I.P. Blood. 1998; 91: 1924-1933Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, a major problem with these studies is that they may fail to reveal redundant pathways emanating from these tyrosines. Analysis of tyrosine null and add-back mutants has provided a useful approach to investigate the complex roles of individual cytoplasmic tyrosine residues in cytokine receptor signaling (40Itoh T. Liu R. Yokota T. Arai K.I. Watanabe S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 742-752Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 41Longmore G.D. You Y. Molden J. Liu K.D. Mikami A. Lai S.Y. Pharr P. Goldsmith M.A. Blood. 1998; 91: 870-878Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we used this approach to delineate the function of tyrosine-mediated pathways from the G-CSF-R. In addition, we chose a cell system, myeloid 32D cells, which most closely mimics in vivodifferentiation, because these cells are able to differentiate from blast-like cells into mature neutrophils. The results of this analysis revealed multiple signals emanating from the receptor tyrosines to control proliferation, differentiation, and survival (Fig. 7). In addition, these studies show that signals independent of receptor tyrosines also contribute to differentiation and survival. We found that signals from the G-CSF-R for both survival at low G-CSF concentration and differentiation largely overlapped, being mediated most strongly by Tyr-704 and Tyr-744, with a lesser contribution from Tyr-729. This showed a close correlation with the ability of these tyrosines to activate STAT3 in these cells. The involvement of STAT3 in G-CSF-mediated granulocytic differentiation is consistent with a recent study showing that expression of dominant-negative STAT3 could totally block this process (42Shimozaki K. Nakajima K. Hirano T. Nagata S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25184-25189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). However, our data also suggest that STAT3 activation may represent the key pathway in maturation signaling from the full-length G-CSF-R. Furthermore, we provide evidence suggestive of a role for STAT3 in G-CSF-dependent survival signaling, as has also been postulated for the related gp130 receptor component (43Fukada T. Hibi M. Yamanaka Y. Takahashi-Tezuka M. Fujitani Y. Yamaguchi T. Nakajima K. Hirano T. Immunity. 1996; 5: 449-460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar). However, it is clear that, at high G-CSF concentrations, tyrosine-independent survival mechanisms also operate, potentially involving phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (34Hunter M.G. Avalos B.R. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 4979-4987PubMed Google Scholar) or mitogen-activated protein kinase (21Nicholson S.E. Novak U. Ziegler S.F. Layton J.E. Blood. 1995; 86: 3698-3704Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, there appears to be subtle differences in G-CSF-mediated STAT3 activation in 32D cells compared with that we have reported in Ba/F3 cells (18Ward A.C. Hermans M.H.A. Smith L. van Aesch Y.M. Schelen A.M. Antonissen C. Touw I.P. Blood. 1999; 93: 113-124Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), such that the contribution of tyrosine-independent STAT3 activation is less important, whereas the Tyr-729-mediated route represents a novel pathway of STAT3 activation in 32D cells. The reason for these cell-specific differences remains unclear. Proliferation signaling from the G-CSF-R was predominantly mediated via Tyr-704 and Tyr-764, with a minor contribution from Tyr-744. We have previously reported formation of Grb2/SHP-2, Grb2/p90, and Grb2/Shc/p140 complexes in response to G-CSF, the latter two being dependent on Tyr-764 (22de Koning J.P. Schelen A.M. Dong F. van Buitenen C. Burgering B.M. Bos J.L. Lowenberg B. Touw I.P. Blood. 1996; 87: 132-140Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Using in vitro binding studies, we show that Tyr-704 is a direct docking site for SHP-2, whereas Tyr-764 is a direct docking site for SHP-2, Grb2, and Shc, largely consistent with the published consensus binding sites for these molecules (44Songyang Z. Shoelson S.E. Chaudhuri M. Gish G. Pawson T. Haser W.G. King F. Roberts T. Ratnofsky S. Lechleider R.J. Neel B.G. Birge R.B. Fajardo J.E. Chou M.M. Hanafusa H. Schaffhausen B. Cantley L.C.

Ren R. Baltimore D. Ratnofsky S. Feldman R.A. Cantley L.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2777-2785Crossref PubMed Scopus (836) Google Scholar). In addition, we and others have shown that Grb2 interacts with SHP-2 and Shc via binding of its SH2 domain with phosphorylated tyrosines in the SHP-2 C terminus (24Ward A.C. Monkhouse J.L. Hamilton J.A. Csar X.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1448: 70-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 46Vogel W. Ullrich A. Cell Growth Differ. 1996; 7: 1589-1597PubMed Google Scholar) and at position 317 of Shc (31Pawson T. Nature. 1995; 373: 573-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (2234) Google Scholar), respectively. Thus, there appears to be at least four mechanisms by which Grb2 can interact with the activated G-CSF-R: directly via Tyr-764 (complexed with p90?) or indirectly via SHP-2 at Tyr-704 and Tyr-764 or Shc at Tyr-764. The relative role of these alternate complexes in mediating G-CSF responses remains an important consideration for future investigations. However, because SHP-2, Grb2, and Shc have all been implicated in proliferation (31Pawson T. Nature. 1995; 373: 573-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (2234) Google Scholar,47Egan S.E. Giddings B.W.

Chem. 1998; 273: 4904-4908Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), it seems likely that these are the molecules responsible for the proliferative signals emanating from Tyr-704 and Tyr-764. The molecule(s) docking to Tyr-744, which mediate its weak proliferation signal remain to be elucidated. We have previously identified the membrane-distal domain of the G-CSF-R as being essential for the transduction of differentiation signals (19Ward A.C. van Aesch Y.M. Schelen A.M. Touw I.P. Blood. 1999; 93: 447-458Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,25Dong F. van Buitenen C. Pouwels K. Hoefsloot L.H. Lowenberg B. Touw I.P. Mol. Cell.

Med. 1995; 333: 487-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). Analysis of the 32D[mA] clones in this study has revealed that the membrane-distal domain is required for differentiation independent of receptor tyrosines (Figs. 2 and 3). However, because the 32D[mO] clones differentiated poorly, we can presume that this domain alone is insufficient to induce complete maturation but rather co-operates with additional tyrosine-dependent signals (such as from Tyr-704 or Tyr-744). We have recently shown that this region is important for receptor internalization and concomitant deactivation (19Ward A.C. van Aesch Y.M. Schelen A.M. Touw I.P. Blood. 1999; 93: 447-458Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, it is likely that a major function of this tyrosine-independent differentiation domain is to negatively regulate proliferation. Consistent with this, mD, which contains this domain, elicits sustained proliferation but at a reduced rate compared with mDA, which does not. In addition, the minor activation of STAT3 by this domain could also contribute to its differentiation-inducing function. The data presented here has unequivocally assigned specific roles to the tyrosines of the G-CSF-R in mediating differentiation, proliferation, and survival in a myeloid system capable of full neutrophilic differentiation. We have shown that the four tyrosines of the G-CSF-R possess distinct, yet overlapping, functions. This is a similar conclusion to that obtained from recent studies with other cytokine receptors, such as the erythropoietin receptor (41Longmore G.D. You Y. Molden J. Liu K.D. Mikami A. Lai S.Y. Pharr P. Goldsmith M.A. Blood. 1998; 91: 870-878Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and the common β-chain of the granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor receptor (40Itoh T. Liu R. Yokota T. Arai K.I. Watanabe S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 742-752Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Having now identified the key intracellular mediators downstream of the receptor tyrosines, future studies will aim to identify the targets of these molecules in eliciting the various G-CSF-mediated biological responses.

It is possible that different conjugating machineries operate under different physiological conditions or in different cells. Generation and activation of the transcription factor NF-κB involve two successive ubiquitin- and proteasome-mediated proteolytic steps: (i) processing of the precursor protein p105 to the active subunit p50 and (ii) signal-induced degradation of the inhibitor IκBα. Degradation of IκBα is triggered by a broad array of stimuli, such as binding of cytokines or viral products to their appropriate receptors. The receptors then recruit adaptor proteins such as TRADD and TRAF. Consequently, activated NF-κB-inducing kinase (1Malinin N.L. Boldin M.P. Kovalenko A.V. Wallach D.

Complex formation leads, most probably, to activation of the IκB kinases that phosphorylate NF-κB-complexed IκBα on serines 32 and 36.

Also, recent studies have identified an SCF complex that contains Skp1p, Cullin1, and the F-box protein β-TrCP as the ubiquitin-IκBα ligase complex (see for example Refs. 11Yaron A. Hatzubai A.

Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 284-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). However, all these studies have not identified the ubiquitin carrier protein(s) involved in targeting of phosphorylated IκBα (pIκBα), 1The abbreviations used are: pIκBα, phosphorylated IκBα; E1, ubiquitin-activating enzyme; E2, ubiquitin carrier protein; E3, ubiquitin-protein ligase; TNF-α, tumor necrosis factor α; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. and the identity of the enzyme(s) has remained elusive. The ubiquitin system targets a wide array of short-lived regulatory proteins such as transcriptional activators, tumor suppressors and growth modulators, cell cycle regulators, and signal transduction pathway components. Consequently, it is involved in the regulation of many basic cellular processes. Among these are cell cycle and division, differentiation, and development; response to stress and extracellular stimuli; modulation of cell-surface receptors; DNA repair; regulation of the immune and inflammatory responses; biogenesis of organelles; and apoptosis. Degradation of a protein by the ubiquitin system involves two distinct and successive steps: (i) covalent attachment of multiple ubiquitin molecules to the target protein and (ii) degradation of the tagged substrate by the 26 S proteasome. Conjugation proceeds via a three-step mechanism involving three enzymes. Initially, ubiquitin is activated by the ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1). One of several E2 enzymes (ubiquitin carrier proteins or ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes (designated UBCs)) transfers ubiquitin from E1 to the substrate, either directly or via a member of the ubiquitin-protein ligase family of enzymes (E3) to which the substrate protein is specifically bound. The first ubiquitin moiety typically binds via its C-terminal Gly and generates an isopeptide with an ε-NH2 group of a Lys residue of the protein substrate. In successive reactions, a polyubiquitin chain is synthesized by transfer of additional activated ubiquitin moieties to Lys48 of the previously conjugated molecule. The structure of the ubiquitin system appears to be hierarchical: a single E1 carries out activation of ubiquitin required for all modifications. It can transfer ubiquitin to several species of E2 enzymes. Each E2 acts in concert with either one or several E3 enzymes. Following conjugation, the protein moiety of the adduct is recognized, most probably via its polyubiquitin chain, and degraded by the 26 S proteasome complex. Free and reutilizable ubiquitin is released via the activity of isopeptidases (for recent reviews and a monograph on the ubiquitin system, see, for example, Refs. 14Baumeister W. Walz J. Zuhl F.

A few E2 enzymes, such as E2-C, which is involved in the targeting cyclins (18Aristarkhov A. Eytan E. Moghe A. Admon A. Hershko A. Ruderman J.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4294-4298Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), appear to be E3- and substrate group-specific. Other E2 enzymes are involved in transfer of ubiquitin to several E3 enzymes and in the targeting of different groups of substrates. Three homologous human enzymes (UBCH5a, UBCH5b, and UBCH5c) have been described (19Jensen J.P. Bates P.W. Yang M. Vierstra R.D. Weissman A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30408-30414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) that are closely related to Saccharomyces cerevisiae Ubc4 and Ubc5, which are involved in targeting many cellular proteins, particularly under stress. They are also homologous to Drosophila melanogaster UBCD1 and to Arabidopsis thalianaUBC8–12. UBCH5b and UBCH5c are ∼98% identical, whereas UBCH5a is ∼90% similar to the b and c species. Members of the family have been shown to be involved in cell-free conjugation of several proteins (e.g. p53 (20Scheffner M. Huibregtse J.M. Howley P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8797-8801Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar) and p105 (21Coux O. Goldberg A.L. J. Biol.

The cellular substrates of these enzymes have, however, remained obscure. S. cerevisiae cdc34/ubc3, which is involved in G1 → S transition, encodes a 295-amino acid E2 (23Goebl M.G. Yochem J.

The supernatant from the last centrifugation step was collected and either used as a crude extract or further fractionated over DEAE-cellulose onto unadsorbed material (Fraction I) and a high salt eluate (Fraction II) as described (29Hershko A.

Active-site, dominant-negative mutants of the different E2 enzymes (C85A UBCH5a, C85A UBCH5b, C85A UBCH5c, C93A CDC34/UBC3, C92A E2-25K, and C87A E2-20K) were generated by a two-step polymerase chain reaction as described (36Higuchi R.

For transient expression in mammalian cells, the cDNAs were subcloned into the pCAGGS vector (38Niwa H. Yamamura K. Miyazaki J. Gene (Amst.). 1991; 108: 193-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (4597) Google Scholar), whereas for tetracycline-inducible expression, they were subcloned into the pUHG10-3 vector (39Gossen M. Freundlieb S. Bender G. Muller G. Hillen W. Bujard H. Science. 1995; 268: 1766-1769Crossref PubMed Scopus (2040) Google Scholar). Sequences of all the constructs were verified using the ABI 310 or ABI 377 autosequencers (Perkin-Elmer). Identification of the transfected cDNAs was carried out by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction of cellular RNA following induction by doxycycline and primers from noncoding regions in the vectors used for transfection. Amplified cDNAs were diagnosed by specific restriction analysis. For purification of the His-tagged E2 enzymes, BL21(DE3) cells, transformed with the appropriate expression constructs, were cultured in 2× YT medium, and isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (400 μm) was added when A600 nm attained 0.6. The induced proteins were purified over Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose according to the manufacturer's instructions. For transient expression of the various E2 enzymes, 293 cells were transfected with the various E2 constructs using the DEAE-dextran method (40Guan J.L. Rose J.K. Cell. 1984; 37: 779-787Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Transfection efficiency was always >75% as determined by parallel transfection with a gene encoding green fluorescent protein. Experiments were carried out 40–48 h following transfection. Stable transformants of HeLa Tet-on cells (CLONTECH) for inducible expression of mutant E2 enzymes were established by calcium phosphate transfection as described (41Iwai K. Klausner R.D. Rouault T.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5350-5357Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Protein expression was induced by the addition of 1 μg/ml doxycycline for 48 h. Induction of the proteins was monitored by Western blot analysis using anti-His tag antibody. [35S]Methionine-labeled IκBα complexed to HeLa p50/p65 was generated as described (9Alkalay I. Yaron A.

Briefly, cDNAs coding for wild-type or S32A,S36A mutant IκBα were translated/transcribed in vitro in wheat germ extract in the presence of [35S]methionine. For phosphorylation and incorporation into endogenous cellular NF-κB complex, the labeled protein was incubated in HeLa cell extract in the presence of okadaic acid. Following incubation, anti-p65 antibody was added, and the immune complex was immobilized on protein A-Sepharose beads. The washed immobilized complex was used as a substrate in the different conjugation assays. Conjugation of IκBα to ubiquitin was monitored essentially as described (9Alkalay I. Yaron A. Hatzubai A.

Briefly, the reaction mixture contained (in final volume of 25 μl) 4 μl of packed and washed protein A-Sepharose beads containing the labeled IκBα protein (∼20,000 cpm), 40 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 5 mmMgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 5 μg of ubiquitin, and 0.5 μg of the isopeptidase inhibitor ubiquitin aldehyde (42Hershko A. Rose I.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 1829-1833Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Crude HeLa cell extract (60 μg), Fraction II (45 μg of protein), Fraction I (15 μg; as a source of E2), and Fraction IIA (25 μg; as a source of E3); E1 (0.75 μg); E2-14K (0.75 μg); E2-C (0.5 μg); E2-8A (0.75 μg); UBCH7 (0.75 μg); and E2-25K (1.0 μg) were added as indicated. UBCH5a, UBCH5b, and UBCH5c were added at 0.75 μg or as indicated, whereas CDC34/UBC3 was added at 1.25 μg or as indicated. The different Cys-to-Ala mutant species of UBCH5a, UBCH5b, and UBCH5c and of CDC34/UBC3 were added as indicated. E2-20K was added at 0.8 μg or as indicated. The biological activity of the different E2 enzymes was monitored using formation of E2-S∼ubiquitin thiol ester in the presence of E1 as described (29Hershko A. Heller H. Elias S. Ciechanover A. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 8206-8214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The IκBα phosphopeptide and S32A,S36A peptide were added at 40 μm. In mixtures containing the peptides, bestatin was added at 20 μg/ml and was incubated for 15 min at room temperature with all the components of the reaction except for the peptides and the labeled substrate. Following addition of the peptides, the reaction mixture was further incubated for 5 min at 30 °C prior to the addition of the labeled substrate. All mixtures containing the peptides contained also 2 μm okadaic acid. When complete HeLa cell extract (25 μg) was used as a source of endogenous substrates, endogenous E1 and E2 and E3 enzymes were inactivated by N-ethylmaleimide (10 mm; 10 min at room temperature) followed by neutralization with dithiothreitol (6 mm; 1 min at room temperature). E1, the different E2 enzymes, Fraction IIA (as a source of E3 enzymes), and125I-labeled ubiquitin (0.1 μg, ∼100,000 cpm) were added as described above and in the figure legends. The complete reaction mixtures were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C in the presence of ATP (0.5 mm ATP and ATP-regenerating system) (30Blumenfeld N. Gonen H. Mayer A. Smith C.E. Siegel N.R.

Reactions were terminated by the addition of 12.5 μl of 3-fold concentrated sample buffer and, following boiling, were resolved via SDS-PAGE (10%). Gels were dried, and [35S]methionine-labeled proteins were visualized using a PhosphorImager (Fuji, Japan). 125I-Labeled proteins were visualized following exposure to Kodak XAR-5 film. The fate of IκBα was monitored in cells that were stably or transiently transfected with the different species of E2 enzymes. Following incubation in the presence of TNF-α (10 ng/ml), cells were harvested at the indicated time points, lysed in sample buffer, and resolved via SDS-PAGE (10%). The resolved proteins were blotted onto nitrocellulose paper, and the inhibitor was visualized by Western blot analysis using a specific antibody, a secondary horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody, and ECL reaction as described (31Abu Hatoum O. Gross-Mesilaty S. Breitschopf K. Hoffman A. Gonen H. Ciechanover A. Bengal E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5670-5677Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Degradation of bacterially expressed MyoD was followed in crude HeLa cell Fraction II by Western blot analysis as described (31Abu Hatoum O. Gross-Mesilaty S. Breitschopf K. Hoffman A. Gonen H.

HeLa Tet-on cells stably transfected with C85A UBCH5b and C85A UBCH5c were labeled with [35S]methionine (100 μCi/ml) for 5 min (pulse). Following removal of the labeling amino acid, the cells were incubated for the indicated time periods in the presence of excess unlabeled methionine (chase), and degradation was monitored by measuring release of trichloroacetic acid-soluble radioactivity into the medium as described (43Gropper R.

Cell extracts derived from uninduced or doxycycline-induced HeLa cells stably transfected with Cys-to-Ala mutant UBCH5b and UBCH5c or from 293 cells transiently transfected with Cys-to-Ala mutant CDC34/UBC3 were resolved via SDS-PAGE (10%). Resolved proteins were blotted onto nitrocellulose paper and probed with anti-ubiquitin antibody as described (31Abu Hatoum O. Gross-Mesilaty S. Breitschopf K. Hoffman A. Gonen H. Ciechanover A. Bengal E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5670-5677Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Protein concentration was determined according to Bradford (44Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216428) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Ubiquitin was iodinated, using the chloramine-T method, as described (29Hershko A. Heller H. Elias S. Ciechanover A. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 8206-8214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To identify the ubiquitin carrier proteins involved in conjugation of pIκBα in the context of the heterotrimeric pIκBα·p50·p65 complex, a cell-free system was reconstituted. The system contained E1, Fraction IIA (as a source of E3), and different species of purified E2 enzymes. As shown in Fig. 1A, only UBCH5b and UBCH5c conjugated the inhibitor in a specific manner. The adducts are of high molecular mass, but more important, they are specific to the phosphorylated species of the inhibitor: they are not generated when the S32A,S36A mutant species of IκBα is used as a substrate. UBCH5a, UBCH7, and E2-8A also conjugated the inhibitor; however, the conjugates are mostly of the low molecular mass type and do not appear to be specific: S32A,S36A IκBα is also targeted. E2-20K, E2-25K, E2-C, and E2-14K did not conjugate the inhibitor at all. To further establish the specificity of these two E2 enzymes, we tested the effect of a specific phosphopeptide that spans the phosphorylation domain of IκBα. This peptide blocks specifically the conjugation reaction by interfering with the recognition by E3 (10Yaron A. Gonen H. Alkalay I. Hatzubai A. Jung S. Beyth S. Mercurio F. Manning A.M.

Previously, it was shown that reduced O-glycosylation of Sp1 is associated with increased proteasome susceptibility. Sp1 undergoes proteasome-dependent degradation in cells stressed with glucose deprivation and adenylate cyclase activation, and this process is blocked in cells treated with glucosamine. In this study, using a reconstituted in vitro system, we identified the principal structural determinant in Sp1 that targets Sp1 for proteasome-dependent degradation. We found by using deletion analysis that the N-terminal 54 amino acids of Sp1 is required for Sp1 degradation. This element can act as an independent processing signal by directing degradation of an unrelated protein. Recognition of this Sp1 element by the proteasome-dependent system is saturable, and ubiquitination of this element is not required for recognition. Time course experiments revealed that Sp1 degradation is a two-step process. First, a discrete endoproteolytic cleavage occurs downstream of the target region immediately C-terminal to Leu56. The Sp1 sequence C-terminal to the cleavage site is subsequently degraded, whereas the N-terminal peptide remains intact. The identification of this Sp1 degradation-targeting signal will facilitate the identification of the critical proteins involved in the control of Sp1 proteasome-dependent degradation and the role of OGlcNAc in this process.

Most of this regulation occurs through either post-translational modifications of Sp1 or by alterations in the abundance of Sp1 protein. The principal known post-translational modifications of Sp1 are phosphorylation and glycosylation through theO-linkage of the monosaccharide,N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) 1The abbreviations used are: O-GlcNAc, O-linkedN-acetylglucosamine; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; DTT, dithiothreitol; GRR, glycine-rich region; GST, glutathioneS-transferase; LLnL, N-acetyl-l-leucinyl-l-leucinyl-l-norleucinal; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time-of-flight; NCS, newborn calf serum; NRK, normal rat kidney; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; PEST, proline-glutamate/aspartate-serine-threonine; PMSF, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; NEM, N-ethylmaleimide; AMP-PNP, adenosine 5′-(β,γ-imino)triphosphate.

Cell. 1990; 63: 155-165Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of Sp1 occurs under a variety of circumstances. It has been shown that altered levels of phosphorylation of Sp1 result in changed DNA binding activity (6Armstrong S.A. Barry D.A. Leggett R.W. Mueller C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13489-13495Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 23Daniel S. Zhang S. DePaoli-Roach A.A. Kim K.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14692-14697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). With regard toO-glycosylation of Sp1, our laboratory has proposed two potential roles for O-GlcNAc in Sp1 function. By using a model peptide based on the Sp1 transcriptional activation domain, we previously showed that the hydrophobic interactions into which this peptide entered were blocked by O-GlcNAc modification of the peptide (24Roos M.D. Su K. Baker J.R. Kudlow J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6472-6480Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). The other potential role of O-GlcNAc in Sp1 function is in the control of Sp1 stability (25Han I. Kudlow J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2550-2558Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). We found that under the experimental conditions of glucose starvation and adenylate cyclase activation, the O-GlcNAc modification of most of the cellular proteins vanished. Sp1 was among the proteins so modified; however, Sp1 was the only transcription factor examined that was degraded by a protease that could be inhibited by specific inhibitors of the 26 S proteasome. Conversely, treatment of cells with glucose or glucosamine resulted in increased protein modification byO-GlcNAc and stabilization of Sp1 to proteolytic degradation. These observations have established a correlation between the glycosylation state of Sp1 and its ability to be proteolytically degraded. Furthermore, these results suggested that the degradation of Sp1 under these circumstances was relatively specifically targeted at Sp1. However, Sp1 is probably not the only protein whose stability is associated with the O-GlcNAc state. It has been shown that an O-glycosylated protein, p67, controls the phosphorylation and activity of elongation factor 2 in protein synthesis (26Datta B. Ray M.K. Chakrabarti D. Wylie D.E. Gupta N.K.

Loss of p67 results in the phosphorylation of elongation factor 2 and the inhibition of protein synthesis. We have proposed that the O-GlcNAc state of Sp1 or perhaps other proteins may be involved in a mechanism that coordinates cellular nutritional status with growth and general protein synthesis. That the proteasome-dependent degradation of Sp1 appears to be relatively selective is in concordance with evidence that transcription factor abundance or activity can be selectively regulated by proteolytic mechanisms (29Chen Z.J.

In general, those proteins that are destined for degradation are first modified covalently by the attachment of multiple ubiquitin peptides, which, in turn, are recognized by the proteasome (31Ciechanover A.

In this study, we established an in vitro system to analyze Sp1 degradation. This system allowed the identification of the N-terminal 54 amino acids of Sp1 as the major domain that targets Sp1 for proteasome-dependent degradation. We also showed that Sp1 degradation is a two-step process. An endoproteolytic cleavage occurs downstream of this target region, followed by the degradation of the C-terminal portion. This target domain in Sp1 is both necessary and sufficient for the targeting of this transcription factor for the endocleavage, and this domain does not need to be ubiquitinated for this function. The elucidation of this Sp1 target domain will facilitate studies that connect protein O-glycosylation with the control of Sp1 abundance. LLnL (N-acetyl-l-leucinyl-l-leucinyl-l-norleucinal) and forskolin were purchased from Sigma. Lactacystin was purchased from Dr. E. J. Corey (Harvard University, Boston), andclasto-lactacystin β-lactone was purchased from Calbiochem. The above drugs were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO) and stored at −20 °C for later use. Glutathione-Sepharose and reduced free glutathione were purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Glucosamine, ATP, AMP-PNP,N-ethylmaleimide, hemin, 2,4-dinitrophenol, 2-deoxyglucose, phosphocreatine, creatine phosphokinase, and thrombin were purchased from Sigma. Monoclonal anti-GST antibody was purchased from Sigma. Polyclonal anti-Gal4 DNA binding domain (amino acids 1–147) antibody was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Polyclonal antiserum to Sp1 (3517) was raised against the C-terminal portion of Sp1 as described previously (11Shin T.H. Paterson A.J. Grant III, J.H. Meluch A.A. Kudlow J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3998-4006Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Normal rat kidney (NRK) cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) with 10% newborn calf serum (NCS), nonessential amino acids (Life Technologies, Inc.), 100 μg/ml penicillin (Sigma), and 50 μg/ml gentamicin (Sigma) at 37 °C in a humidified incubator with 7.0% CO2 (51de Larco J.E. Todaro G.J. J. Cell. Physiol. 1978; 94: 335-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). For stimulation of the cells, exponentially growing cells were seeded at 2.5 × 106 of cells per 100-mm diameter dish at approximately 30% confluency. After overnight incubation, the cell culture medium was changed to glucose-free DMEM containing 10% NCS, and the cells were incubated for additional 20 h. The cells were then treated with 5 mm glucosamine or 100 μmforskolin as indicated in glucose-free DMEM containing 10% NCS, and the incubation was continued for an additional 24 h. Lactacystin and LLnL were added to the cells at a concentration of 20 and 50 μm, respectively, 24 h prior to harvest. BSC40 cells were grown in DMEM with 10% NCS, 100 μg/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml gentamicin at 37 °C in a humidified incubator with 7.0% CO2. The full-length human Sp1 cDNA (kindly provided by Dr. James Kadonaga) was cloned into the pTM3GST vector, and a recombinant vaccinia virus was generated as described previously (25Han I. Kudlow J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2550-2558Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar,52Moss B. Science. 1991; 252: 1662-1667Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). The cDNAs encoding various fragments of Sp1 were obtained by restriction enzyme digestion or PCR amplification using high fidelityPfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and cloned into the pTM3GST vector. The resulting plasmids (pTM3GST-Sp1 fragment) were transfected into BSC40 cells by electroporation at 250 V and 500 microfarads. After overnight recovery, the cells were infected with recombinant vaccinia virus VTF7-3 containing the T7 RNA polymerase coding sequence (53$$Google Scholar). At 24 h after infection, whole cell extract was prepared by freezing and thawing the cells three times in the extraction buffer (20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 0.5 mNaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 20% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, and 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF)). Glutathione-Sepharose beads were incubated with the whole cell extract for 30 min at 4 °C. The glutathione beads were then collected and washed three times in the extraction buffer. The fusion proteins bound to the glutathione beads were either eluted with 20 mm reduced free glutathione or cleaved from GST with 4 units of thrombin per mg of fusion protein. Nuclear extract was prepared as described (54Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9164) Google Scholar). Approximately 2 × 107 cells were washed by ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline twice and scraped into 6 ml of cold phosphate-buffered saline. The cells were collected by centrifugation for 3 min at 2,000 × g at 4 °C. The cells were resuspended in 1 ml of ice-cold buffer A (10 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.9 at 4 °C), 3 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm DTT, and 1 mm PMSF) and allowed to stand on ice for 10 min. The cells were gently vortexed for 10 s and centrifuged for 15 s at 16,000 × g to pellet nuclei. The supernatant was thoroughly decanted, and the nuclei were resuspended in 80 μl of buffer C (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.9 at 4 °C), 20% glycerol, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 300 mm NaCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, and 1 mm PMSF). The suspension was intermittently homogenized by pipetting over a period of 30 min incubation on ice and then centrifuged for 15 min at 16,000 × g at 4 °C. The resulting supernatant was collected and designated as nuclear extract (the protein concentration is approximately 5 μg/μl). The ATP-depleted nuclear extract was prepared as described (55Ciechanover A. Hod Y. Hershko A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1978; 81: 1100-1105Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). For the reconstituted degradation assay, the glutathione-eluted GSTSp1 or other GST fusion protein (approximately 10 ng) was mixed with nuclear extract (containing 50 μg of protein) in the presence or absence of 330 μmLLnL. The mixing reaction was performed in a volume of 12 μl in 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 250 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 9% glycerol, 1 mm DTT, and 1 mm PMSF and was incubated on ice or room temperature for 2 h or as indicated. The proteins in the reaction mixture were then separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and analyzed by Western blot analysis using anti-GST antibody. In the experiment involvedclasto-lactacystin β-lactone, nuclear extract was preincubated with β-lactone for 25 min at room temperature prior to the addition of GSTSp1 protein. To test the ATP dependence of the degradation assay, the indicated reagents were added at the following final concentrations: 2 mm ATP, 5 or 20 mmAMP-PNP, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm NEM, and 100 μm hemin. The ATP-regenerating system consisted of 10 mm creatine phosphate and 100 μg/ml creatine phosphokinase (55Ciechanover A. Hod Y. Hershko A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1978; 81: 1100-1105Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar, 56Fan C.-M. Maniatis T. Nature. 1991; 354: 395-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). These reagents were added to the nuclear extract, and the mixture was incubated at 30 °C for 20 min. Purified GSTSp1 protein was added to the preincubated mixture, and the incubation was continued at 30 °C for another 60 min. The reaction mixture was then subjected to Western blot analysis using anti-GST antibody. The samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE on 8 or 10% gels, transferred to ECL-Hybond nitrocellulose membranes (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), blotted with the primary antibody overnight at 4 °C and with the secondary antibody (anti-rabbit or mouse immunoglobulin, horseradish peroxidase-linked whole antibody from donkeys, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 1 h at room temperature, and then subjected to enhanced chemiluminescence detection (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The vaccinia virus-expressed GST-SpV or GST-Sp1 was purified and immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads. The beads were mixed with differently treated NRK nuclear extracts for 1 h at room temperature. The beads were then extensively washed and cleaved with thrombin to release the Sp1 fragment from GST; 5m guanidine was applied to elute all the components into the solution. The resulting solution was subjected to mass spectroscopy analysis. Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectroscopy was carried out on a Perspective Biosystems (Framingham, MA) Voyager Elite MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer. Samples were mixed with a saturated solution of α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid in a water/acetonitrile (50:50) mixture acidified with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. A 1-μl aliquot of the sample was spotted onto the gold plate target. Ionization of the sample was accomplished with a nitrogen laser operated at 337 nm. A delayed extraction method was used in the determination of molecular mass. Measurement of ion flight times through the drift region of the mass spectrometer was carried out with a Tektronix (Beaverton, OR) model TDS784A oscilloscope. The instrument was calibrated with external molecular weight standards. To map the domain of Sp1 protein that targets its degradation, we established an in vitro reconstituted system for Sp1 degradation. Our previous studies had shown that when NRK cells were glucose-starved and stimulated with forskolin, Sp1 protein was rapidly degraded in intact cells, and the degradation was inhibited by the proteasome inhibitors, lactacystin and LLnL, but not by a cysteine protease inhibitor, E64-D (25Han I. Kudlow J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2550-2558Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). Sp1 protein was not degraded when the cells were glucose-starved alone, or treated with glucosamine, or cultured in normal glucose-containing medium (5 mm). Furthermore, we showed, by using mixing experiments, that intact Sp1 in nuclear extract from glucosamine-treated cells could be degraded by nuclear extract from cells previously treated with glucose starvation and forskolin. Based on these observations, we established an Sp1 degradation assay using purified GSTSp1 that had been expressed recombinantly in a vaccinia virus-based protein expression system. This GSTSp1 protein was mixed with nuclear extract from differently treated NRK cells. The mixture was incubated on ice for 2 h before protein separation on SDS-PAGE. Western blot analysis using anti-GST monoclonal antibody was performed to detect the degradation of GSTSp1. As shown in Fig. 1A, GSTSp1 was not degraded by nuclear extract from cells that had been glucosamine-treated (Fig.1A, lane 1), whereas GSTSp1 was degraded by extract from glucose-starved and forskolin-stimulated cells (Fig. 1A,lane 2). A degradation product, termed GSTSpX (Fig. 1A, lane 2), was detected with the GST antibody and is discussed later. The degradation of GSTSp1 was inhibited by the addition to the reaction mixture of the proteasome inhibitor, LLnL, suggesting that this degradation was proteasome-dependent (Fig. 1A, lane 3). As negative controls, vaccinia virus-expressed GST, GST-epidermal growth factor receptor extracellular domain, and GST-SpE (SpE contains domain B, a glutamine-rich activation domain of Sp1 (24Roos M.D. Su K. Baker J.R. Kudlow J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6472-6480Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar)) were not degraded under the same conditions (Fig. 1A, lanes 4–12). Similarly, we also observed that GST-Sp1 was not degraded by nuclear extract from the cells that had been glucose-starved alone or cultured in normal glucose-containing medium (data not shown). The degradation of GSTSp1 in vitro has been correlated with the degradation of Sp1 in vivo. Given that LLnL is also a calpain inhibitor (57Moriyama T. Sather S.K. McGee T.P. Simoni R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22037-22043Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 58Sasaki T. Kishi M. Saito M. Tanaka T. Higuchi N. Kominami E. Katunuma N. Murachi T. J. Enzyme Inhib. 1990; 3: 195-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar), we tested whether the degradation of GSTSp1 in this reconstituted system had other features characteristic of the 26 S proteasome-dependent degradation (56Fan C.-M. Maniatis T. Nature. 1991; 354: 395-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). As shown in the left panel of Fig. 1B, the addition of the nonhydrolyzable ATP analog, AMP-PNP, to the reaction mixture at 5 and 20 mm concentrations blocked the degradation of GSTSp1 (Fig. 1B, lanes 2–4). Furthermore, we also prepared ATP-depleted nuclear extract. NRK cells were glucose-starved and stimulated with forskolin. At 2 h before cell harvest, 2,4-dinitrophenol and 2-deoxyglucose were added to the culture medium to deplete the cellular ATP. As shown in Fig. 1B, lane 5, GSTSp1 was not degraded by this nuclear extract. However, when 2 mm ATP and Mg2+ were added to the extract, degradation of GSTSp1 was restored (lane 8). The addition of Mg2+ alone or Mg2+with AMP-PNP did not stimulate the degradation (lanes 7 and9). Together, these data demonstrate that the degradation of Sp1 in this reconstituted system is ATP-dependent. As shown in lanes 10 and 11, the addition of 5 mm NEM or 100 μm hemin to the reaction inhibited the degradation of GSTSp1, showing that the degradation of GSTSp1 in this system was sensitive to NEM and hemin. The ATP dependence and the sensitivity to hemin and NEM are all features of the 26 S proteasome and suggest that the in vitro degradation of GSTSp1 is proteasome-dependent. The right panel shows a Western blot analysis using anti-Sp1 antibody to determine the content of endogenous Sp1 in the nuclear extract used in the reconstituted assay. The endogenous Sp1 protein level in the nuclear extract confirms our previous observation that the treatments of the cells resulted in the respective preservation or loss of Sp1in vivo. To confirm further the degradation of GSTSp1 in this reconstituted system is proteasome-dependent, we made use of the proteasome-specific inhibitor, lactacystin. Lactacystin has been known to inhibit specifically the 20 S and 26 S proteasome activity without inhibiting any other protease yet tested, including the serine proteases trypsin and chymotrypsin and the cysteine proteases papain, calpain I and II, and cathepsin B (59Fenteany G.

Functional interactions between CaM kinases and mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases were described. In this report, we describe cross-talk between calcineurin and mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling. Calcineurin was found to specifically down-regulate the transcriptional activity of transcription factor Elk1, following stimulation of this activity by the ERK, Jun N-terminal kinase, or p38 MAP kinase pathways. Expression of constitutively activated calcineurin or activation of endogenous calcineurin by Ca2+ ionophore decreased the phosphorylation of Elk1 at sites that positively regulate its transcriptional activity. Calcineurin specifically dephosphorylates Elk1 at phosphoserine 383, a site whose phosphorylation by MAP kinases makes a critical contribution to the enhanced transcriptional activity of Elk1. The cross-talk between calcineurin and MAP kinases is of physiological significance as low doses of Ca2+ ionophore which by themselves are insufficient for c-fos induction can actually inhibit induction of c-fos expression by activators of MAP kinases. Thus through the effect of calcineurin on Elk1 phosphorylation, Ca2+ can have a negative effect on expression of Elk1 target genes. This mechanism explains why different levels of intracellular Ca2+ can result in very different effects on gene expression.

These transcription factors can therefore mediate some of the effects of elevated intracellular Ca2+ on gene transcription (4Tokumitsu H. Soderling T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5617-5622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Calcineurin consists of a catalytic subunit, CnA, and a regulatory subunit, CnB (6Guerini D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 235: 271-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Besides a catalytic domain, which is conserved among members of the protein phosphatase family, which includes protein phosphatases 1 and 2a and bacteriophage λ phosphatase (7Lohse D.L. Denu J.M. Dixon J.E. Structure. 1995; 3: 987-990Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), CnA contains a C-terminal autoinhibitory domain as well as CaM and CnB binding domains (12Villafranca J.E. Kissinger C.R. Parge H.E. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 1996; 7: 397-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Ca2+/CaM binding activates CnA by relieving autoinhibition, which, in the absence of Ca2+/calmodulin, blocks access of substrates to the catalytic site (13Kissinger C.R. Parge H.E. Knighton D.R. Lewis C.T. Pelletier L.A. Tempczyk A. Kalish K.D. Showalter R.E. Moomaw E.W. Nature. 1995; 378: 641-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar). A truncation that removes the autoinhibitory domain and a portion of the CaM binding region results in a constitutively active form (ΔCaM-AI) that no longer requires Ca2+ (14Clipstone N.A.

Nature. 1992; 357: 692-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (781) Google Scholar). Calcineurin is a target for immunosuppressive drugs, such as cyclosporin A (CsA) and FK506 (16Stoddard B.L. Flick K.E. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1996; 6: 770-775Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). These drugs inhibit calcineurin activity after forming complexes with cytoplasmic immunophilins, cyclophilins, and FK506-binding proteins, respectively (16Stoddard B.L. Flick K.E. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1996; 6: 770-775Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). These immunophilin-immunosuppressant complexes bind calcineurin and inhibit its function by sterically hindering the access of substrates to the catalytic site (13Kissinger C.R. Parge H.E. Knighton D.R. Lewis C.T. Pelletier L.A. Tempczyk A. Kalish K.D. Showalter R.E. Moomaw E.W. Nature. 1995; 378: 641-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar, 17Griffith J.P. Kim J.L. Kim E.E.

Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 235: 271-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The most well characterized functions of calcineurin are during T cell activation (18Crabtree G.R. Clipstone N.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 1045-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar). Upon binding of antigen to T cell receptor, intracellular Ca2+ is elevated through the action of protein tyrosine kinases and phospholipase C (19Berridge M.J. Nature. 1993; 361: 315-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (6147) Google Scholar, 20Cantrell D.A. Cancer Surv. 1996; 27: 165-175PubMed Google Scholar, 21Clapham D.E. Cell. 1995; 80: 259-268Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2254) Google Scholar). Calcineurin is then activated through binding of Ca2+/CaM and dephosphorylates the cytosolic forms of the NF-ATc transcription factors (22Luo C. Shaw K.T. Raghavan A. Aramburu J. Garcia-Cozar F. Perrino B.A. Hogan P.G. Rao A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8907-8912Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). The dephosphorylated NF-ATc proteins translocate to the nucleus, where either alone or in cooperation with AP-1 family members bind specific cis elements in the promoter/enhancer regions of cytokine genes, such as IL-2 (23Jain J. McCaffrey P.G. Miner Z. Kerppola T.K. Lambert J.N. Verdine G.L. Curran T. Rao A. Nature. 1993; 365: 352-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar, 24Northrop J.P. Ullman K.S. Crabtree G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2917-2923Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This pathway makes an important contribution to induction of IL-2 gene transcription, a hallmark of T cell activation (18Crabtree G.R. Clipstone N.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 1045-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar, 20Cantrell D.A. Cancer Surv. 1996; 27: 165-175PubMed Google Scholar). Genes expressed in other cell types were identified to be affected by CsA and FK506, but NF-AT family members are not known to be involved in their control (25Enslen H. Soderling T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20872-20877Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Gonzaalez-Cuadrado S. Bustos C. Ruiz-Ortega M. Ortiz A. Guijarro C. Plaza J.J. Egido J. Clin. Exp.

Therefore, there must be additional transcription factors whose activity is modulated by calcineurin.An additional target for calcineurin that is involved in T cell activation is a yet-to-be identified component of the signaling pathway that leads to activation of JNK (Jun N-terminal kinase) in T cells (28Werlen G. Jacinto E. Xia Y. Karin M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3101-3111Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Stimulation of T cells with a phorbol ester and Ca2+ionophore results in synergistic JNK activation, which is blocked by CsA or FK506 (29Su B. Jacinto E. Hibi M. Kallunki T. Karin M. Ben-Neriah Y. Cell. 1994; 77: 727-736Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (847) Google Scholar). Recent studies have shown that the target for calcineurin is a T cell-specific component of the JNK pathway that acts in synergy with protein kinase Cθ (28Werlen G. Jacinto E. Xia Y. Karin M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3101-3111Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). However, in other cell types calcineurin activation or treatment with CsA has no effect on JNK activity (28Werlen G. Jacinto E. Xia Y. Karin M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3101-3111Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar).In addition to JNK, which belongs to the MAP kinase (MAPK) family, mammalian cells express two other MAPK cascades that link a variety of extracellular stimuli to changes in gene expression (30Khosravi-Far R. Der C.J. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 1994; 13: 67-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). The most well characterized MAPK cascade leading to ERK activation is stimulated most efficiently by mitogens and growth factors, which activate receptor tyrosine kinases (31Davis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14553-14556Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Like all MAPKs, the ERKs are phosphorylated and activated by specific MAPK kinases (MAPKKs), the MEKs, which themselves are activated by MAPKK kinases (MAPKKKs), one of which is Raf-1 (30Khosravi-Far R. Der C.J. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 1994; 13: 67-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar,32Marshall C.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 197-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). The MAPK pathways that lead to JNK and p38 MAPK activation are most potently triggered by physical and chemical stresses (UV irradiation, osmotic shock, and heat shock) and proinflammatory cytokines (33Karin M. Hunter T. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 747-757Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar, 34Rouse J. Cohen P. Trigon S. Morange M. Alonso-Llamazares A. Zamanillo D. Hunt T. Nebreda A.R. Cell. 1994; 78: 1027-1037Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1494) Google Scholar). JNK and p38 are also activated by specific MAPKKs, JNKK1 (MKK4) (35Daerijard B. Raingeaud J.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 7026-7035Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). The three components (MAPK, MAPKK, and MAPKKK) of each cascade are engaged in sequential phosphorylation reactions in the cytoplasm (30Khosravi-Far R. Der C.J. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 1994; 13: 67-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Activated MAPKs are then redistributed in the cell, with a portion entering the nucleus (48Cavigelli M. Dolfi F. Claret F.X. Karin M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5957-5964Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar), where they phosphorylate several transcription factors. The ERKs are known to phosphorylate Elk1 (49Treisman R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4905-4913Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar), ETS2 (50McCarthy S.A. Chen D. Yang B.S. Garcia Ramirez J.J.

The JNKs phosphorylate c-Jun (51Karin M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16483-16486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2244) Google Scholar), ATF2 (52Gupta S. Campbell D. Daerijard B. Davis R.J. Science. 1995; 267: 389-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (1336) Google Scholar), and Elk1 (48Cavigelli M. Dolfi F. Claret F.X. Karin M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5957-5964Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). The p38s phosphorylate ATF2 (52Gupta S. Campbell D. Daerijard B. Davis R.J. Science. 1995; 267: 389-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (1336) Google Scholar), Elk1 (49Treisman R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4905-4913Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar), CHOP (53Wang X. Ron D. Science. 1996; 272: 1347-1349Crossref PubMed Scopus (737) Google Scholar), and MEF2C (54Han J. Jiang Y.Z. vchenko U. Ulevitch R. Nature. 1997; 386: 296-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar). In many of these cases, the transactivating potential of the affected transcription factor is augmented upon its phosphorylation, leading to changes in the expression profile of target genes (33Karin M. Hunter T. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 747-757Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar, 51Karin M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16483-16486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2244) Google Scholar). One target gene for all three MAPK cascades is the c-fos proto-oncogene (49Treisman R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4905-4913Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). The c-fos promoter contains a composite binding site recognized by SRF and ternary complex factors (TCFs) (55Janknecht R. Immunobiology. 1995; 193: 137-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The activity of the TCF protein Elk1 is stimulated by all three MAPK cascades through phosphorylation of sites within its C-terminal activation domain (49Treisman R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4905-4913Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar).Interaction between Ca2+ signals and three MAPKs cascades have been reported. In several cell types, elevated intracellular Ca2+ can stimulate MAPK activity (29Su B. Jacinto E. Hibi M. Kallunki T. Karin M. Ben-Neriah Y. Cell. 1994; 77: 727-736Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (847) Google Scholar, 56Freodin M. Sekine N. Roche E. Filloux C. Prentki M. Wollheim C.B. Van Obberghen E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7882-7889Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Specifically, CaM-Ks may activate MAPK cascades in fibroblasts (57Enslen H. Tokumitsu H. Stork P.J. Davis R.J. Soderling T.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10803-10808Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). As mentioned above, in T cells, calcineurin can participate in JNK activation through synergy with protein kinase Cθ (28Werlen G. Jacinto E. Xia Y. Karin M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3101-3111Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). In this report, we investigated cross-talk between calcineurin and MAPK pathways in cell lines of either fibroblast or lymphoid origin. We found that calcineurin specifically dephosphorylates one substrate that is common to all three MAPKs, the transcription factor Elk1, thus negatively regulating its transcriptional activity. This mechanism explains the regulatory versatility of intracellular Ca2+, which can exert very different effects on gene expression depending on its level.DISCUSSIONCalcineurin is a ubiquitously expressed protein phosphatase that is activated upon binding of Ca2+-CaM (6Guerini D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 235: 271-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 67Jiang H. Xiong F. Kong S. Ogawa T. Kobayashi M. Liu J.O. Mol. Immunol. 1997; 34: 663-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). So far the roles of calcineurin in signal transduction and gene regulation have been investigated only in lymphoid cells, brain, heart, and other limited cell types (28Werlen G. Jacinto E. Xia Y. Karin M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3101-3111Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 68Molkentin J.D. Lu J.R. Antos C.L. Markham B. Richardson J. Robbins J. Grant S.R. Olson E.N. Cell. 1998; 93: 215-228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2191) Google Scholar, 69Winder D.G. Mansuy I.M. Osman M. Moallem T.M. Kandel E.R. Cell. 1998; 92: 25-37Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). The functions of calcineurin in other cell types are poorly understood. The work described above links calcineurin to a ubiquitous sequence-specific transcription factor, Elk1, which serves as a target for all three MAPK pathways and plays an important role in induction of immediate-early gene transcription.We found that activation of calcineurin can inhibit the stimulation of Elk1 transcriptional activity by all three MAPK cascades. MAPK activation is known to be inhibited by specific MAPK phosphatases, such as MKP-1, which directly dephosphorylate the activating phosphoacceptor sites within the T-loop regions of MAPKs (70Shapiro P.S. Ahn N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1788-1793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In the case reported here, however, the target for the phosphatase is a specific MAPK substrate rather the MAPK themselves. However, it is likely that MAPK phosphatases and calcineurin, although structurally not related, may act synergistically in vivo. Indeed, in fission yeast, disruption of the calcineurin gene (ppb1+) results in a dramatic chloride-sensitive growth arrest (71Sugiura R. Toda T. Shuntoh H. Yanagida M. Kuno T. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 140-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). A novel gene pmp1+, which encodes a MAPK phosphatase, suppresses this defect (71Sugiura R. Toda T. Shuntoh H. Yanagida M. Kuno T. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 140-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Although the biochemical mechanism accounting for this functional interaction is not known, in light of our results it is possible that calcineurin (Ppb1) dephosphorylates a MAPK substrate involved in regulation of chloride ion transport. In the absence of calcineurin, the substrate accumulates in its phosphorylated state, which prevents chloride export. One way to reverse this effect is to inhibit the activity of the MAPK responsible for the phosphorylation event.Elk1 is the most abundant of the TCFs, first characterized as transcription factors involved in induction of c-fos and other members of its family by diverse extracellular stimuli (64Janknecht R. Cahill M.A. Nordheim A. Carcinogenesis. 1995; 16: 443-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The Fos proteins are basic leucine zipper (bZIP) transcription factors, which dimerize with the Jun proteins to form stable AP-1 heterodimers (72Angel P. Karin M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1072: 129-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (3245) Google Scholar). The proteins are involved in the regulation of many target genes. Transcription of the c-fos gene is activated by a variety of stimuli such as serum, EGF and other growth factors, UV irradiation, Ca2+, cAMP, phorbol esters, and various cytokines (49Treisman R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4905-4913Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar,64Janknecht R. Cahill M.A. Nordheim A. Carcinogenesis. 1995; 16: 443-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar).The inactivation of Elk1 by calcineurin-mediated dephosphorylation adds another layer to the complexity of c-fos promoter regulation and Ca2+ signaling (summarized in Fig. 8). The c-fos promoter contains two major cis elements, the CRE and the SRE (64Janknecht R. Cahill M.A. Nordheim A. Carcinogenesis. 1995; 16: 443-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The CRE (cAMP response element) is recognized by the CREB/ATF group of bZIP proteins. The activity of CREB is stimulated by phosphorylation at Ser-133, which can be catalyzed by a number of protein kinases including the cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (73Lalli E. Sassone-Corsi P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17359-17362Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the Ca2+/CaM-dependent CaM kinases (74Sheng M. Thompson M.A. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1991; 252: 1427-1430Crossref PubMed Scopus (1272) Google Scholar), phorbol ester-responsive protein kinase C (75Xie H. Rothstein T.L. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 1717-1723PubMed Google Scholar), and growth factor-responsive ribosomal S6 kinases (76Pende M. Fisher T.L. Simpson P.B. Russell J.T. Blenis J. Gallo V. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 1291-1301Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The activity of ATF2 is stimulated by JNK and p38-mediated phosphorylation at threonine 71 (52Gupta S. Campbell D. Daerijard B. Davis R.J. Science. 1995; 267: 389-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (1336) Google Scholar), whereas the mechanisms that control the activity of other ATFs are not yet known. This probably is the reason why calcineurin cannot completely block the induction of c-fos transcription by anisomycin (Fig. 6B), since ATF2 can also be phosphorylated by activated JNK and p38 and is not dephosphorylated by calcineurin (Fig. 7A). The SRE is a composite binding site for the SRFs and the TCFs (64Janknecht R. Cahill M.A. Nordheim A. Carcinogenesis. 1995; 16: 443-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Several TCFs were identified, including Elk1 (49Treisman R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4905-4913Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar), Sap1/2 (77Dalton S. Treisman R. Cell. 1992; 68: 597-612Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar), and Erp/Net (78Giovane A. Pintzas A. Maira S.M. Sobieszczuk P. Wasylyk B. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1502-1513Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). The TCFs belong to the Ets family, characterized by a conserved Ets DNA binding domain (66Sharrocks A.D. Brown A.L. Ling Y. Yates P.R. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1997; 29: 1371-1387Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). The TCFs interact with the SRE only in conjunction with binding of SRF (79Shaw P.E. Schreoter H. Nordheim A. Cell. 1989; 56: 563-572Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). Although SRF may respond to signals that are transmitted by members of the Rho family of small G-proteins (80Hill C.S. Wynne J. Treisman R. Cell. 1995; 81: 1159-1170Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1199) Google Scholar), or CaM kinases (11Miranti C.K. Ginty D.D. Huang G. Chatila T. Greenberg M.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3672-3684Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar), most of the signals sensed by the SRE are received by the TCFs (49Treisman R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4905-4913Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar, 64Janknecht R. Cahill M.A. Nordheim A. Carcinogenesis. 1995; 16: 443-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The ability of Elk1 and Sap1/2 to activate transcription is stimulated by phosphorylation of conserved sites at their C-terminal activation domain (58Marais R. Wynne J. Treisman R. Cell. 1993; 73: 381-393Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1104) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of these sites is mediated by various MAPKs, including ERK, p38, and JNK (49Treisman R.

It was shown that c-fos promoter activity correlates temporally with the phosphorylation state of Elk1 (81Zinck R. Hipskind R.A. Pingoud V. Nordheim A. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2377-2387Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Thus not only Elk1 phosphorylation is an important mechanism for regulation of c-fostranscription but also its dephosphorylation is likely to be instrumental in shutting off c-fos transcription. Originally it was suggested that Elk1 might be inactivated by a constitutive phosphatase (81Zinck R. Hipskind R.A. Pingoud V. Nordheim A. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2377-2387Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Although such phosphatase may also be involved in Elk1 inactivation, the present study identified calcineurin as a physiologically relevant Elk1 phosphatase. While this manuscript was being prepared for publication, a similar conclusion was derived by Sugimoto et al. (82Sugimoto T. Stewart S. Guan K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29415-29418Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), although these authors documented the involvement of calcineurin only in the context of ERK-mediated Elk1 activation. Here we report that this dephosphorylation is specific to Elk1 (calcineurin does not affect c-Jun"

We have previously shown preferential binding of recombinant human RPA (rhRPA) to duplex cisplatin-damaged DNA compared with the control undamaged DNA (Patrick, S. M., and Turchi, J. J. (1998) Biochemistry 37, 8808–8815). Here we assess the binding of rhRPA to DNA containing site-specific cisplatin-DNA adducts. rhRPA is shown to bind 1.5–2-fold better to a duplex 30-base pair substrate containing a single 1,3d(GpXpG) compared with a 1,2d(GpG) cisplatin-DNA intrastrand adduct, consistent with the difference in thermal stability of DNA containing each adduct. Consistent with these data, a 21-base pair DNA substrate containing a centrally located single interstrand cisplatin cross-link resulted in less binding than to the undamaged control DNA. A series of experiments measuring rhRPA binding and concurrent DNA denaturation revealed that rhRPA binds duplex cisplatin-damaged DNA via the generation of single-stranded DNA. Single-strand DNA binding experiments show that rhRPA binds 3–4-fold better to an undamaged 24-base DNA compared with the same substrate containing a single 1,2d(GpG) cisplatin-DNA adduct. These data are consistent with a low affinity interaction of rhRPA with duplex-damaged DNA followed by the generation of single-stranded DNA and then high affinity binding to the undamaged DNA strand.

Cisplatin, cis-diamminedichloroplatinum(II), is a chemotherapeutic drug used to treat a variety of cancers. A major clinical limitation of cisplatin treatment is the development of cellular resistance (1Eastman A. Cancer Treat. Res. 1991; 57: 233-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 2Perez R.P. Hamilton T.C. Ozols R.F. Young R.C. Cancer. 1993; 71: 1571-1580Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The cytotoxic action is believed to involve the formation of covalent DNA-adducts which block the enzymes involved in replication and transcription (reviewed in Ref. 3Chu G. J. Biol.

Karran P. Wood R.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 480-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). These unique DNA structural distortions induced by the cisplatin adducts are believed to be responsible for the differential repair and may individually influence protein recognition, which could ultimately lead to differential metabolism of damaged DNA. Proteins that bind to cisplatin-damaged DNA have been implicated as important components in the sensitivity of cells to cisplatin treatment (4Zamble D.B. Lippard S.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 435-439Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). By understanding how each individual DNA adduct is repaired and understanding the mechanisms of protein recognition, the development of better DNA-targeted chemotherapeutic drugs is possible.

The use of xeroderma pigmentosum cell lines, which are deficient in NER, has led to the isolation and characterization of the human proteins required for NER (12Wood R.D. Robins P. Lindahl T.

The XPA and RPA proteins have been implicated in the initial recognition of damaged DNA and have been shown to interact in the absence of DNA (15Matsuda T. Saijo M. Kuraoka I. Kobayashi T. Nakatsu Y.

Independently, both XPA and RPA have been shown to exhibit preferential binding to damaged DNA and in conjunction a synergistic effect on binding was observed (17Jones C.J. Wood R.D. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 12096-12104Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar, 18Burns J.L. Guzder S.N. Sung P. Prakash S. Prakash L. J. Biol.

Nature. 1995; 374: 566-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). Recently, the p34 subunit of RPA has been shown to be responsible for the XPA interaction and stimulation of XPA UV-damaged DNA binding (20Stigger E. Drissi R. Lee S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9337-9343Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Support for RPA mediating the subsequent NER reactions has been obtained in vitro where RPA interacts with the XPG and XPF-ERCC1 proteins (19He Z. Henricksen L.A. Wold M.S. Ingles C.J. Nature. 1995; 374: 566-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar, 21Matsunaga T. Park C.H. Bessho T. Mu D. Sancar A. J. Biol.

Chem. 1997; 272: 3833-3837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). It has also been shown that RPA can enhance the binding and nuclease activities of XPG and XPF-ERCC1 to bubble and loop substrates (21Matsunaga T. Park C.H. Bessho T. Mu D. Sancar A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11047-11050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Other reports suggest that RPA may protect the nondamaged strand from incision by XPG and XPF-ERCC1 during NER (23Evans E. Fellows J. Coffer A. Wood R.D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 625-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 24de Laat W.L. Appeldoorn E. Sugasawa K. Weterings E. Jaspers N.G. Hoeijmakers J.H. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2598-2609Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). The mechanism of damaged strand incision discrimination, however, has not been defined. Our data support a role for RPA regulating the incision of the damaged DNA strand by binding the single-stranded DNA opposite the DNA adduct. This would support the hypothesis that RPA protects the undamaged strand from cleavage by XPG and XPF-ERCC1. We have previously purified a protein that binds cisplatin-damaged DNA, DRP-3 (25Patrick S.M. Turchi J.J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 8808-8815Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Comparison of the protein subunits, the complexes formed between DNA, and EMSA supershift analysis confirmed that DRP-3 is RPA. We have also shown, by EMSA analysis, that rhRPA preferentially binds duplex cisplatin-damaged DNA compared with the undamaged control DNA dependent upon salt concentration (25Patrick S.M. Turchi J.J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 8808-8815Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Here we show that rhRPA binding increases with moderate levels of cisplatin-DNA damage before excess DNA damage results in decreased rhRPA binding. Increasing cisplatin-DNA damage also results in the formation of cisplatin-DNA interstrand cross-links. We have assessed binding and denaturation to a series of substrates containing site-specific cisplatin-DNA adducts and have correlated binding with denaturation. Experiments using bubble substrates and single-stranded DNA suggest that RPA recognizes the structural distortion in the DNA and not specifically the cisplatin-DNA adduct. These data support the hypothesis that RPA binds duplex-damaged DNA, denatures the unstable region near the adduct, and then binds the single-stranded DNA opposite the adduct to regulate DNA repair. These results are discussed with respect to RPA binding and the regulation of cisplatin-DNA repair. Oligonucleotides were purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc. (Coralville, IA) and purified by 15% polyacrylamide, 7 m urea preparative sequencing gel electrophoresis. Radiolabeled nucleotides were from NEN Life Science Products and unlabeled nucleotides were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. T4 polynucleotide kinase was purchased from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). Sequenase (version 2.0) was purchased from U. S. Biochemical Corp. Mung bean nuclease was from Life Technologies, Inc. Cisplatin was purchased from Sigma. All other reagents were from the standard suppliers. The rhRPA expression vector was kindly provided by Marc Wold and purified as described previously (26Henricksen L.A. Wold M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24203-24208Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The duplex 44-bp DNA was prepared by annealing the complementary 25-mer depicted in TableI and extended using Sequenase, [α-32P]dGTP, and dNTPs (27Turchi J.J. Li M. Henkels K.M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2992-3000Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The substrate was subsequently purified on a 15% native gel followed by treatment with mung bean nuclease to ensure that no contaminating single-stranded DNA was present and purified by spin column chromatography (25Patrick S.M. Turchi J.J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 8808-8815Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The platination reactions were separate for each individual substrate and described in the platination section below. The 30-base DNA oligonucleotides used to prepare the 1,2d(GpG) and 1,3d(GpXpG) substrates as well as the sequences for the other oligonucleotides are shown in Table I. The 30-bp DNA substrates were 5′-labeled using T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP and, following platination, annealed to the complementary oligonucleotides, which are depicted as either 1,2-C or 1,3-C in Table I. The bubble substrates were prepared similarly, but following labeling and platination, the 1,3d(GpXpG) oligonucleotide was annealed to the 1,2d(GpG) complementary oligonucleotide, 1,2-C, to give an 8-base bubble substrate. The interstrand cross-link substrtate was prepared from the I.C. (interstrand cross-link) oligonucleotide depicted in Table I and its complementary DNA, I.C.-C. The 19-base oligonucleotide, I.C., was designed to have a 2-base overhang when annealed to the complement I.C.-C, so that one could extend the substrate to yield a duplex 21-bp DNA. The 21-bp interstrand cross-link substrate was prepared by using the 19-mer, I.C., platinating at a 1:1 D/N ratio (drug to nucleotide ratio), annealing the complementary 19-mer, I.C.-C, incubating the annealed substrate in 0.1 m NaClO4 for 15 h at 37 °C, purified by ion-exchange chromatography using Qiagen resin (Chatsworth, CA), and subsequently extended with Sequenase and dNTPs. The platinated duplex substrate was then purified on a 10% polyacrylamide, 7 m urea preparative gel. The cisplatin-interstrand cross-linked DNA migrated with a molecular mass of 40–45 nucleotides and was excised from the gel, eluted, and ethanol-precipitated. Both the unplatinated and platinated substrates were run on a 15% native gel to separate the duplex from any contaminating single-stranded DNA and subsequently treated with mung bean nuclease and labeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP (28Turchi J.J.

The 24-base DNA with a single 1,2d(GpG) cisplatin-DNA adduct was 5′-labeled using T4 kinase and [γ-32P]ATP, platinated, and purified on a 18% sequencing gel to separate the undamaged DNA from the DNA reacted with cisplatin (29Patrick S.M. Henkels K.M. Turchi J.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1354: 279-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar).

Drug to nucleotide ratios refer to the molar amount of cisplatin to the molar amount of nucleotides within a given substrate. The DNA was purified from unreacted cisplatin by G-50 spin column chromatography or ethanol precipitation followed by washing with 70% ethanol (30Turchi J.J. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15136-15141Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The 30-base DNA substrates (1,2 and 1,3) were 5′-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase, platinated at 1:1 D/N ratios, and annealed to the complementary oligonucleotide followed by treatment with either HaeIII or AciI for the 1,2d(GpG) or 1,3d(GpXpG) cisplatin-DNA adducts, respectively, and were subsequently purified on a 15% native gel. This ensures that 100% of the substrate was platinated. The undamaged control DNA substrates were not digested with restriction enzymes. The counts per minute recovered was determined by liquid scintillation counting an aliquot of the eluate, and on the basis of the specific activity, the picomoles of DNA recovered was calculated. EMSAs were performed as described previously (27Turchi J.J. Li M. Henkels K.M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2992-3000Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Reactions were performed with 50 fmol of DNA in the presence of 50 mm NaCl and in the presence or absence of 2 mmMgCl2 as indicated in the figure legends. Reaction products were separated by either 4 or 6% native gels. Gels were dried and quantified by PhosphorImager analysis as described previously (25Patrick S.M. Turchi J.J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 8808-8815Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). For the denaturation experiments, EMSA reactions were split in half and half analyzed by EMSA analysis and the other half terminated by the addition of 0.1% Orange G dye, 25 mm EDTA, 0.5% SDS, and 5 mg of proteinase K to denature the protein-DNA interaction and allow the separation of duplex and single-stranded DNA. These products were then analyzed on 15% native gels and quantified by PhosphorImager analysis. Previously, we have shown that rhRPA preferentially binds a duplex 44-bp DNA globally treated with cisplatin at a D/N ratio of 0.2:1 compared with the undamaged control DNA of identical sequence dependent on salt concentration (25Patrick S.M. Turchi J.J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 8808-8815Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). To determine the effect of increasing cisplatin-DNA damage on rhRPA binding, the same 44-bp DNA was treated with increasing amounts of cisplatin and binding assessed in an EMSA (Fig. 1A). The DNA was purified as described under “Experimental Procedures” and contained no contaminating single-stranded DNA as evident by native gel analysis (data not shown). The increase in cisplatin-DNA adducts distorts the DNA structure, resulting in a decreased mobility of the free DNA in the gel (lanes 1–6) (31Pil P.M. Chow C.S. Lippard S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9465-9469Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). It was anticipated that increasing cisplatin-DNA damage would result in an increase in rhRPA binding, similar to the observation of RPA binding UV-damaged DNA (18Burns J.L. Guzder S.N. Sung P. Prakash S. Prakash L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11607-11610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). In reactions containing 50 mm NaCl and no MgCl2, however, rhRPA binding reached a peak at intermediate cisplatin-DNA damage before a decrease in rhRPA binding was observed (lanes 1–6). The presence of MgCl2 shifted the peak to the right, but still resulted in a decrease in rhRPA binding with higher levels of cisplatin-DNA damage (data not shown). Quantification of the binding results reveals about a 10-fold enhanced binding of rhRPA to the DNA damaged with a D/N ratio of 0.2:1 compared with the undamaged DNA (Fig. 1B), consistent with that reported previously (25Patrick S.M. Turchi J.J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 8808-8815Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). A decrease in RPA binding of 30% was observed from the peak of binding obtained at a D/N of 0.2 to that observed at a D/N of 5. The observation that rhRPA binding decreases at higher cisplatin-DNA damage is in contradiction to the results that increased rhRPA binding was observed to DNA with increasing UV DNA damage (18Burns J.L. Guzder S.N. Sung P. Prakash S. Prakash L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11607-11610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The enhanced binding of RPA to UV-damaged DNA was suggested to be the result of binding to the single-stranded nature in the DNA structure caused by the UV-induced (6-4) photoproduct (18Burns J.L. Guzder S.N. Sung P. Prakash S. Prakash L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11607-11610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The interaction of cisplatin with DNA results in a variety of adducts, some of which increase single-strand generation and those that prevent single-stranded DNA formation. Sequencing gel analysis of the duplex 44-bp DNA (Fig. 2) shows an increase in the formation of cisplatin-DNA interstrand cross-links with increasing cisplatin-DNA damage (lanes 1–7). Lane 2 represents contaminating DNA that was purified away through native gel purification and is most likely incompletely extended DNA that occurred during the substrate preparation. The covalent bond formed between the platinum and the N7 positions of the guanines on two complementary DNA strands, cisplatin-interstrand cross-link, inhibits the denaturation of the two strands and results in a complex with a molecular weight about twice that expected (indicated by the brace, I.C.). The formation of DNA interstrand cross-links could be responsible for the decreased ability of rhRPA to bind/denature the duplex 44-bp DNA. At the highest level of cisplatin-DNA damage, greater than 80% of the DNA has at least one interstrand cross-link. The sequence of the duplex 44-bp DNA reveals that the interstrand cross-links can form at both ends of the DNA at three specific dGdC sites. All three sites are within 7 bases of either terminus. This would still allow rhRPA to bind in the central region of the DNA and may be the reason why rhRPA binding is not completely inhibited at the highest level of cisplatin-DNA damage. Considering the results correlating the percent interstrand cross-links with a decrease in rhRPA binding, we assessed binding of rhRPA to a DNA substrate containing a single site-specific, centrally located cisplatin-interstrand DNA cross-link (Fig. 3A). The 21-bp DNA was constructed as described previously (28Turchi J.J. Patrick S.M. Henkels K.M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 7586-7593Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) and purified to remove any contaminating single-stranded DNA (see “Experimental Procedures”). Approximately 95% of the substrates purified via this method contained an interstrand cross-link (data not shown). EMSA analysis revealed that increasing rhRPA concentrations resulted in a low level of rhRPA binding to the undamaged duplex control DNA substrate (lanes 1–5), and interestingly, even lower levels of rhRPA binding to the DNA substrate containing a single cisplatin-DNA interstrand cross-link (lanes 5–10). Quantification of the EMSA is shown in Fig. 3B. The high level of rhRPA binding the undamaged control DNA is likely the result of decreased stability of the 21-bp DNA. Increasing the duplex DNA length increases the DNA stability and decreases the nonspecific rhRPA binding as can be seen when comparing the undamaged 21-bp DNA, a 25-bp undamaged DNA, and the undamaged 30-bp DNA (data not shown). The inability of rhRPA to bind a substrate containing a cisplatin-interstrand cross-link is consistent with rhRPA binding occurring via denaturation of the duplex DNA. We do observe a low level of rhRPA binding to the interstrand cross-link DNA, which could be the result of the 5% contaminating duplex undamaged DNA or an extremely low affinity for DNA containing a cisplatin-interstrand cross-link. RPA has been shown to denature undamaged DNA substrates, including long stretches of duplex DNA dependent on the ionic strength (32Georgaki A. Strack B. Podust V. Hubscher U. FEBS Lett. 1992; 308: 240-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 33Treuner K. Ramsperger U. Knippers R. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 259: 104-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). RPA has also been shown to bind and denature DNA substrates containing an SV40 “pseudo-origin” of replication (34Iftode C. Borowiec J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3876-3883Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In order to assess whether the denaturation ability of rhRPA was responsible for the preferential binding observed to duplex cisplatin-damaged DNA compared with duplex undamaged DNA, a series of experiments were performed with the duplex undamaged and 0.1:1 cisplatin-treated DNA substrates measuring both DNA binding (data not shown) and DNA denaturation (Fig. 4A). Separation of reaction products was achieved using a 15% native gel in the denaturation experiments. In addition, SDS and proteinase K were added to the stop buffer to denature the protein and disrupt the protein-DNA interaction. The 4% native gels used in the EMSAs do not resolve single-strand from duplex DNA and also do not distinguish between rhRPA bound to duplexversus single-stranded DNA. Increasing rhRPA concentrations resulted in minimal generation of single-stranded DNA for the undamaged control DNA (lanes 1–6) under these experimental conditions, while an increase in single-stranded DNA was observed for the cisplatin-damaged DNA (lanes 7–12). The quantification (Fig. 4B) reveals that rhRPA binding to duplex DNA correlates with an increase in the generation of single-stranded DNA. These data suggest that rhRPA binding to cisplatin-damaged DNA is mediated through the ability to bind duplex DNA and generate single-stranded DNA to which rhRPA binds with high affinity. Divalent cations, including Mg2+, have been shown to wind and stabilize duplex DNA (35Xu Y.C. Bremer H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 4067-4071Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The NaCl and MgCl2 stabilize the duplex-undamaged DNA and inhibit rhRPA binding/denaturation, while the cisplatin adducts destabilize the DNA structure largely independent of ionic strength. If rhRPA binding is proportional with the thermal instability of the DNA duplex, DNA substrates with varying thermal stabilities should result in varying degrees of binding by RPA. Therefore, DNA substrates were designed containing either a single site-specific 1,2d(GpG) or 1,3d(GpXpG) cisplatin-DNA adduct. The 1,2 adduct induces a bend and unwinds the duplex DNA, but results in no localized single-stranded DNA (36Takahara P.M. Rosenzweig A.C. Frederick C.A. Lippard S.J. Nature. 1995; 377: 649-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (742) Google Scholar). In contrast, the 1,3 adduct results in a localized denaturation of approximately 2 bases around the adduct (37Anin M.F. Leng M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 4395-4400Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 38van Garderen C.J. van Houte L.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 225: 1169-1179Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). We have shown previously a 4–6-fold preference for rhRPA binding a duplex 25-bp DNA containing a single 1,2d(GpG) cisplatin-intrastrand DNA adduct compared with the same undamaged substrate (25Patrick S.M. Turchi J.J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 8808-8815Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Here we have designed longer substrates for rhRPA binding analysis of both types of intrastrand adducts in order to increase the stability of the DNA and decrease the nonspecific binding of rhRPA to the undamaged DNA. The 30-bp substrates used for the cisplatin-intrastrand rhRPA binding experiments were prepared as described under “Experimental Procedures” and were completely devoid of any contaminating single-stranded DNA. The binding reactions were conducted in the presence of 50 mm NaCl and 2 mm MgCl2 to minimize damage-independent binding (Fig. 5). Increasing rhRPA concentrations resulted in minimal rhRPA binding to the undamaged 30-bp DNA (data not shown), while an increase in the amount of rhRPA bound was observed using the same substrate with a single 1,2d(GpG) cisplatin-DNA adduct (Fig. 5A, lanes 1–5). Quantification of the results reveals up to 10-fold enhanced binding of rhRPA to the 1,2d(GpG) duplex-damaged DNA compared with the undamaged control (Fig. 5B, filled and open circles, respectively). Fig. 5A also shows the EMSA analysis of increasing concentrations of rhRPA binding the same substrate with a single 1,3d(GpXpG) cisplatin-DNA adduct (lanes 6–10). Quantification reveals greater than 15-fold enhanced binding of rhRPA to the 1,3d(GpXpG) cisplatin-DNA adduct compared with the undamaged control DNA of identical sequence in the linear ranges of the graph (Fig. 5B, filled and open squares, respectively). The quantification also reveals about a 1.5–2-fold preferential binding to the 1,3d(GpXpG) cisplatin-DNA intrastrand adduct compared with the 1,2d(GpG) cisplatin-DNA intrastrand adduct under identical binding conditions (filled squares andfilled circles, respectively). As seen with the 44-bp DNA, the binding of rhRPA to the 30-bp DNAs correlates with the ability to denature the DNA substrate (data not shown). These data suggest that the unique structural distortions induced by the individual intrastrand adducts influence rhRPA binding. The differential binding of rhRPA to different DNA adducts could ultimately be responsible for the differential repair rates that have been shown previously for these two types of cisplatin-DNA intrastrand adducts (10Moggs J.G. Szymkowski D.E. Yamada M. Karran P. Wood R.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 480-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). These data are consistent with a role for RPA in the initial steps of the NER process (19He Z. Henricksen L.A. Wold M.S. Ingles C.J. Nature. 1995; 374: 566-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). The results from the cisplatin damage titration (Fig. 1) and the differential binding of rhRPA to substrates containing a cisplatin 1,2d(GpG) and a 1,3d(GpXpG) intrastrand DNA adduct (Fig. 5) suggest that rhRPA is binding the structural distortion and not specifically to the cisplatin-DNA adduct. To address this hypothesis, DNA substrates containing 8-base bubbles were designed to further assess the binding specificity of rhRPA on duplex DNA substrates. The 30-bp bubble substrates were prepared as described under “Experimental Procedures,” and denaturation experiments ensured the substrates were devoid of contaminating single-stranded DNA (data not shown). EMSAs were performed with 50 fmol of DNA and increasing concentrations of rhRPA under the conditions stated under “Experimental Procedures,” and the results are shown in Fig. 6A. The substrates used for the EMSA were the duplex 30-bp DNA with a single 1,3d(GpXpG) cisplatin-DNA adduct (data not shown), a 30-bp undamaged DNA with an 8-base bubble (lanes 1–5), and the same 8-base bubble substrate with a single 1,3d(GpXpG) cisplatin-DNA adduct located within the bubble region (lanes 6–10). Results from the quantification show an increase in rhRPA binding to the 30-bp DNA with a single 1,3d(GpXpG) cisplatin-DNA adduct (filled circles) consistent with that presented earlier (Fig. 5B). The binding of rhRPA to the undamaged 8-base bubble substrate (filled squares), however, is 3–4-fold better than to the 30-bp DNA with the single 1,3d(GpXpG) cisplatin-DNA adduct (filled circles). Interestingly, the level of rhRPA binding to the 8 base bubble substrate with a 1,3d(GpXpG) cisplatin-DNA adduct (open squares) is lower than that of the undamaged 8-base bubble substrate (filled squares). This data suggests that rhRPA is binding via the structural distortion in the damaged DNA and not specifically interacting with the cisplatin-DNA adduct. It also suggests that the cisplatin-DNA adduct may inhibit the binding of rhRPA to the damaged DNA strand. To better understand the binding mechanism of rhRPA to cisplatin-damaged DNA, a single-stranded 24-mer DNA was used in an EMSA to test the hypothesis that rhRPA binding is inhibited by a cisplatin-DNA adduct on single-stranded DNA (Fig. 7A). Increasing rhRPA concentrations were added to 50 fmol of an undamaged single-stranded 24-mer DNA (lanes 1–5) or the same DNA with a single 1,2d(GpG) cisplatin-DNA adduct (lanes 6–10). Quantification of the EMSA shown in Fig. 7B reveals that rhRPA binds 3–4-fold better to the undamaged single-stranded DNA (open circles) compared with the same DNA with a single 1,2d(GpG) cisplatin-DNA adduct (filled circles). This supports the hypothesis that rhRPA is binding and recognizing the DNA distortion in duplex DNA and not specifically the cisplatin-DNA adduct. The data also support a model where following recognition of DNA damage by sensing the thermal instability of the duplex DNA, RPA binds preferentially to the undamaged strand of the duplex damaged DNA (Fig. 8).Figure 8Model of RPA binding cisplatin-damaged DNA. Our data support a model in which RPA binds duplex cisplatin-damaged DNA, denatures the duplex region around the adduct and then binds the single-stranded DNA opposite the adduct. Binding the undamaged strand with a defined polarity (24de Laat W.L. Appeldoorn E. Sugasawa K. Weterings E. Jaspers N.G. Hoeijmakers J.H. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2598-2609Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar) positions the XPG and XPF/ERCC1 nucleases to incise 3′ and 5′, respectively, on the strand containing the cisplatin-DNA adduct. Positioning of the TFIIH complex and XPC-HHR23B remains to be elucidated and have been omitted from this model for clarity.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The process of NER is capable of recognizing and repairing a wide array of bulky DNA damage. The rates of repair of the different DNA-adducts also vary dramatically. The limiting step in NER has been reported to be incision of the damage, which is completely dependent on recognizing the damaged DNA in a background of a vast amount of undamaged chromosomal DNA (reviewed in Ref. 11Sancar A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 43-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (965) Google Scholar). The efficiency of NER has been correlated with the thermodynamic instability of the DNA duplex caused by the individual DNA adducts (39Gunz D. Hess M.T. Naegeli H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25089-25098Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). As the recognition of DNA damage limits the reactions and a correlation between repair and thermal stability of the duplex has been established, one would expect that proteins involved in the initial recognition would show a preference for binding damaged DNA with a lower thermal stability. Our data support this hypothesis, and we have demonstrated that the affinity for damaged DNA correlates with the thermal instability of the duplex DNA. RPA binding to a DNA containing a single 1,3d(GpXpG) cisplatin adduct is more efficient than binding to a 1,2d(GpG) cisplatin adduct (Fig. 5). These data correlate well with the degree of DNA instability caused by each adduct, since the 1,3 adduct results in a localized denaturation of the duplex around the adduct, while the structure of the 1,2 adduct results in the platinated guanines being within hydrogen bonding distance with the complementary cytosines (38van Garderen C.J. van Houte L.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 225: 1169-1179Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar,36Takahara P.M. Rosenzweig A.C. Frederick C.A. Lippard S.J. Nature. 1995; 377: 649-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (742) Google Scholar). Also, our previous data demonstrated that conditions that increase the stability of the duplex DNA inhibit RPA binding, for example, ionic strength of the binding reactions (25Patrick S.M. Turchi J.J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 8808-8815Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In addition, we have shown a single interstrand cisplatin cross-link, which prevents denaturation of the duplex DNA, effectively inhibits RPA binding (Fig. 3). These data are consistent with RPA being involved in the initial recognition of cisplatin-damaged DNA and targeting repair to the damaged site. RPA has been reported to have an affinity for duplex DNA 3 orders of magnitude less than that for single-stranded DNA (reviewed in Ref. 40Wold M.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 61-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (1188) Google Scholar). Our data demonstrate that binding observed in EMSAs proceeds via the denaturation of the duplex DNA substrate. This is consistent with the reported unwinding activity of RPA (32Georgaki A. Strack B. Podust V. Hubscher U. FEBS Lett. 1992; 308: 240-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 33Treuner K. Ramsperger U. Knippers R. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 259: 104-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) and our data measuring denaturation of the duplex undamaged or cisplatin-damaged DNA substrate (Fig. 4). Our data suggest that the protein-DNA complexes observed in EMSAs are in fact RPA complexed to single-stranded DNA that was generated via denaturation of the duplex DNA and that the intermediate in the reaction representing the RPA-duplex DNA is not stable through electrophoresis. Therefore, dissociation constants calculated for duplex DNA may represent the ability to denature and not actual affinity for the RPA-duplex DNA complex. Our data suggest that following RPA-induced denaturation of the duplex-damaged DNA, RPA preferentially binds to the undamaged DNA strand. This was demonstrated in reactions measuring binding of RPA to a 24-base DNA in the presence and absence of a centrally located single cisplatin-DNA adduct. While RPA binding to the platinated DNA was reduced by more than 50% when compared with the undamaged DNA, significant binding was observed to the platinated single-stranded DNA substrate. This could be the result of RPA binding to the regions of the DNA without the adduct, as 11 bases on either side of the adduct are available for high affinity binding. RPA binding to the bubble substrates also support the hypothesis that rhRPA is recognizing the structural distortion in the DNA and not the damaged bases specifically. The decrease in binding the bubble substrate containing the 1,3 adduct is less than that observed with the single-stranded 24-base DNA. This is likely the result of high molar ratio of RPA to duplex DNA necessary to denature the DNA. Once the duplex substrate is denatured, rhRPA can then bind to the single-stranded undamaged strand, which is not labeled and is never detected, as well as to the labeled single-stranded damaged DNA strand. The excess rhRPA could then bind the single-stranded DNA flanking the damaged site, which is 14 bases on either side, resulting in the observed RPA-DNA complex. Consistent with this interpretation, we have observed consistently greater binding activity to the duplex cisplatin-damaged DNA substrate when the complementary, undamaged DNA strand is labeled (data not shown). These data represent the first direct evidence that RPA regulates DNA repair by binding to duplex-damaged DNA, locally denaturing the duplex DNA as a result of the DNA damage, and then binding to the undamaged DNA strand. Our model positioning RPA on the undamaged DNA is consistent with a recent report demonstrating that RPA binds single-stranded DNA with a defined polarity and inhibits cleavage by the XPG and the XPF-ERCC1 endonucleases on the strand that RPA is bound (24de Laat W.L. Appeldoorn E. Sugasawa K. Weterings E. Jaspers N.G. Hoeijmakers J.H. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2598-2609Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of RPA bound to an oligonucleotide also suggests some level of RPA binding polarity (41Bochkarev A. Pfuetzner R.A. Edwards A.M. Frappier L. Nature. 1997; 385: 176-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). Positioning of RPA on the undamaged DNA strand and the defined polarity of binding also positions the other repair factors in the proper orientation for their known enzymatic activities. The N terminus of the 70-kDa subunit of RPA interacts with XPG (19He Z. Henricksen L.A. Wold M.S. Ingles C.J. Nature. 1995; 374: 566-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar), and the 34-kDa subunit of RPA interacts with the XPA protein (20Stigger E. Drissi R. Lee S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9337-9343Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The XPF protein has also been shown to interact with RPA (22Bessho T. Sancar A. Thompson L.H. Thelen M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3833-3837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). These interactions would place XPG 3′ of the cisplatin adduct where it has been shown to incise and the XPF-ERCC1 nuclease 5′ of the adduct where it has been shown to incise (reviewed in Ref. 11Sancar A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 43-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (965) Google Scholar). In addition, binding the undamaged strand by RPA would protect the strand from nuclease incision as has been demonstrated using undamaged synthetic DNA substrates. It will be interesting to determine the possible strand specificity of XPA protein binding when complexed with RPA. In addition, how the TFIIH and XPC-HHR23B components of the NER machinery fit in this model remains to be determined. We thank Karen Henkels for excellent technical assistance and critical reading of the manuscript and Marc Wold for the RPA expression vector."
https://openalex.org/W2055269877,"The correct folding and assembly of proteins within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) are prerequisites for subsequent transport from this organelle to the Golgi apparatus. The mechanisms underlying the ability of the cell to recognize and retain unassembled or malfolded proteins generally require binding to molecular chaperones within the ER. One classic example of this process occurs during the biosynthesis of procollagen. Here partially folded intermediates are retained and prevented from secretion, leading to a build up of unfolded chains within the cell. The accumulation of these partially folded intermediates occurs during vitamin C deficiency due to incomplete proline hydroxylation, as vitamin C is an essential co-factor of the enzyme prolyl 4-hydroxylase. In this report we show that this retention is tightly regulated with little or no secretion occurring under conditions preventing proline hydroxylation. We studied the molecular mechanism underlying retention by determining which proteins associate with partially folded procollagen intermediates within the ER. By using a combination of cross-linking and sucrose gradient analysis, we show that the major protein binding to procollagen during its biosynthesis is prolyl 4-hydroxylase, and no binding to other ER resident proteins including Hsp47 was detected. This binding is regulated by the folding status rather than the extent of hydroxylation of the chains demonstrating that this enzyme can recognize and retain unfolded procollagen chains and can release these chains for further transport once they have folded correctly.

The biosynthesis of multi-subunit proteins entering the secretory pathway is regulated at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) 1The abbreviations used are: ER, endoplasmic reticulum; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; PMSF, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; DSP, dithiobis(succinimidyl propionate); PDI, protein-disulfide isomerase; SBTI, soybean trypsin inhibitor; P4H, prolyl 4-hydroxylase. where the individual subunits are synthesized and their assembly is coordinated. This regulation ensures that unassembled subunits are prevented from being transported out of the ER and are either degraded or maintained in an assembly-competent state by interacting with ER resident proteins (1Hammond C. Helenius A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 523-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar). The mechanism underlying this “quality control” appears to involve the binding of unassembled subunits to a variety of ER proteins until assembly occurs. The assembled complex is then released and can be transported from the ER. Such a mechanism has been likened to affinity chromatography, with the “matrix” being the resident proteins in the ER and the selective interactions occurring via oligosaccharide side chains (2Ware F.E.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2077-2085Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). To investigate further the generality of these mechanisms of retention, we have studied the folding, assembly, and secretion of procollagen. The folding and assembly of procollagen occurs in a vectoral manner; trimerization of individual polypeptides called the pro-α-chains occurs via type-specific association of their C-propeptides (5Prockop D.J. Kivirikko K.I. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 403-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (1388) Google Scholar, 6McLaughlin S.H. Bulleid N.J. Matrix Biol. 1998; 16: 369-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). This association facilitates the formation of a stable nucleus of triple helix at the C-terminal end of the triple helical domain (7Bulleid N.J. Dalley J.A. Lees J.F. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6694-6701Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) that is subsequently propagated to the N terminus in a zipper-like fashion (8Engel J. Prockop D.J. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Chem. 1991; 20: 137-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). The prerequisite for the formation of a triple helix that is stable at physiological temperatures is the 4-hydroxylation of a certain proportion of proline residues within the triple helical domain of the pro-α-chains (9Uitto J. Prockop D.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1974; 43: 221-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), a modification catalyzed by the ER resident enzyme prolyl 4-hydroxylase (P4H) (10Kivirikko K.I. Myllylä R. Pihlajaniemi T. Harding J.J. Crabbe M.J.C. Post-translational Modification of Proteins. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1992: 1-51Google Scholar). Evidence that the procollagens of fibril-forming collagens are subject to a retention mechanism has been provided by studies on type I procollagen synthesized by chick fibroblasts (11Lane J.M. Dehm P. Prockop D.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1971; 236: 517-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 12Uitto J. Dehm P. Prockop D.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1972; 278: 601-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). It was demonstrated that the rate of secretion of the protein is significantly depressed when the formation of the triple helix is prevented either by the incorporation of helix-destabilizing proline analogues into the pro-α-chains or by the inhibition of hydroxylation of the pro-α-chains. Furthermore, point mutations in the genes for the pro-α-chains of type I procollagen which cause the human disease osteogenesis imperfecta have been shown to disrupt the folding of the triple helix and result in the retention and subsequent degradation of the mutant protein within the cell (13Wallis G.A. Starman B.J. Schwartz M.F. Byers P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 265: 18628-18633Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar, 14Prockop D.J. Constantinou C.D. Dombrowski K.E. Hojima Y. Kadler K.E. Kuivaniemi H. Tromp G. Vogel B.E. Am. J. Med. Genet. 1989; 34: 60-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). A number of ER resident proteins have been proposed to mediate the retention of non-native procollagen within the cell, one of these being Hsp47, a collagen-binding heat-shock protein (15Nagata K. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 23-26Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Hsp47 has been shown to bind to a wide range of collagens and procollagens in vitro (16Jain N. Brickenden A. Lorimer I. Ball E.H. Sanwal B.D. Biochem. J. 1994; 304: 61-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 17Natsume T. Koide T. Yokota S. Hirayoshi K. Nagata K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31224-31228Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It also associates with type I procollagenin cellulo (18Nakai A. Satoh M. Hirayoshi K. Nagata K. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 903-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 19Satoh M. Hirayoshi K. Yokota S.-I Hosokawa N. Nagata K. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 469-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar), leading to the suggestion that Hsp47 is a chaperone of procollagen biosynthesis. In addition BiP and PDI have been individually shown to associate with certain mutant forms of type I procollagen that were retained within the fibroblasts of patients with osteogenesis imperfecta (20Chessler S.D. Byers P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7751-7757Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Chessler S.D. Byers P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18226-18233Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, it has been proposed that P4H is a candidate for the ER resident protein involved in mediating procollagen retention. This was based on the fact that the binding affinity of this enzyme for procollagen substratesin vitro was in compliance with the selectivity of the retention mechanism for procollagens in cellulo (22Kao W.H.-Y. Prockop D.J. Berg R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 2234-2243Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). More recently, PDI has been shown to interact specifically with individual C-propeptide chains prior to trimerization (23Wilson R. Lees J.F. Bulleid N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9637-9643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) and with assembled type X collagen (24McLaughlin S.H. Bulleid N.J. Biochem. J. 1998; 331: 793-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). To address the question of which ER resident proteins are involved in the retention of procollagen, we have prepared stable cell lines expressing a type III procollagen mini-gene containing either the authentic C-propeptide or a construct where the C-propeptide has been replaced with a transmembrane domain. Both chains have been shown previously to fold and assemble correctly when expressed in the presence of semi-permeabilized cells (7Bulleid N.J. Dalley J.A. Lees J.F. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6694-6701Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 25Bulleid N.J. Wilson R. Lees J.F. Biochem. J. 1996; 317: 195-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). These cell lines were used to investigate the regulation of procollagen secretion and to identify proteins interacting with partially folded procollagen chains. The results clearly demonstrate a novel role for a post-translational modifying enzyme in the regulation of secretion of its substrate, and the results show that this regulation is not influenced directly by enzymatic activity. HT1080 cells (ATCC CCL121) were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD). A mouse monoclonal antibody to Hsp47 (SPA-470) and a rat monoclonal antibody to GRP94 (SPA-850) were obtained from StressGen (York, UK). A goat polyclonal antibody to BiP (N-20) was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Mile Elm, Calne, UK). A rabbit polyclonal antibody to calreticulin antibody was purchased from Cambridge Biosciences (Cambridge, UK). A rabbit polyclonal antibody to type III procollagen was prepared as described previously (25Bulleid N.J. Wilson R. Lees J.F. Biochem.

A mouse monoclonal antibody specific for the α-subunit of prolyl 4-hydroxylase was a gift from Professor Kari Kivirikko (University of Oulu, Finland), and a mouse anti-Myc monoclonal antibody (9E10) was obtained from Calbiochem (Nottingham, UK) The plasmid pα1(III)Δ1 containing the sequence encoding the prepro-α1(III)Δ1 chain of type IIIΔ1 procollagen had been constructed previously (29Lees J.F. Bulleid N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24354-24360Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). TheSpeI/ClaI fragment excised from pαIIIΔ1 containing the prepro-IIIΔ1 sequence was cloned into theXhoI/AccI endonuclease-treated pCIneovector to create the construct pCIneoIIIΔ1. The plasmid HA-trans was constructed previously (7Bulleid N.J. Dalley J.A. Lees J.F. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6694-6701Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). A Myc-tagged version of pα1(III)Δ1 was prepared by introducing the Myc tag between the end of the signal sequence and the beginning of the coding region using standard polymerase chain reaction techniques as described previously (30Lees J.F. Tasab M. Bulleid N.J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 908-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). A 300-base pair XhoI/KpnI fragment was excised from HA-trans and subcloned intoXhoI/KpnI cut pα1(III)Δ1-Myc to generate HA-trans-Myc. The entire coding region was excised with NotI and subcloned into pIRES1hyg (CLONTECH, Basingstoke, Hampshire, UK) to generate pIREShyg-HA-trans-Myc. All cell lines were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 110 μg ml−1 pyruvate supplemented with 0.3 mg ml−1 glutamine and 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum (complete medium). HT1080 cells at 50–80% confluence were suspended by treatment with trypsin and pelleted by centrifugation. Harvested cells were washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and resuspended in complete medium to an approximate concentration of 1 × 106 cell ml−1. The cell suspension (800 μl) was placed in a 4-mm electroporation cuvette and mixed 1 min prior to the pulse with 30 μg of pCIneoIIIΔ1 linearized with BcgI or 30 μg of pIRES-hyg-HA-trans linearized with SspI. Cells were pulsed at 1650 microfarads/250 V using the EasyJect electroporator (Flowgen) and immediately transferred from the cuvettes into a T162-cm2 flask containing complete medium. Cells were incubated for 48 h and subsequently selected by incubation in media containing G418 sulfate or hygromycin at a concentration of 500 μg ml−1. The resulting G418 or hygromycin-resistant colonies were transferred to a fresh T162-cm2 flask and grown to confluence to give a pooled population of transfectants. A random sample of cells from the pooled population of transfectants was serially diluted in complete medium containing 200 μg ml−1 G418 sulfate or hygromycin to a concentration of 25 cells/ml−1 and 200 μl aliquoted per well of a 96-well plate. Wells containing a single colony of cells were identified after several days of growth and the clones grown to confluence before being transferred to 6-well plates. To identify clones expressing type IIIΔ1 procollagen, proteins present in the medium of the clones were precipitated by the addition of PEG-3000 to a concentration of 5% (w/v), harvested by centrifugation at 12,000 × g, separated by SDS-PAGE, and transferred to nitrocellulose. The membrane was probed with a 1/1000 dilution of an antibody against type III procollagen and developed using a chemiluminescense substrate. The expression level of pro-α1(III)Δ1 was quantitated by metabolic labeling, and B12 was identified as the cell line with the highest expression level. Similarly, indirect immunofluorescence staining using anti-Myc antibody identified clones expressing HA-trans-Myc at the cell surface and F2 was identified as a high expressing cell line. All the following procedures were performed at 37 °C. B12 cells were plated to 50–80% confluence in 100-mm2 culture dishes and incubated for 4 h in complete medium. Cells were rinsed twice with 5 ml of PBS, once with 5 ml of methionine- and cysteine-free minimal Eagle's medium supplemented with 0.3 mg ml−1 glutamine (starve medium), and incubated for 45 min in 5 ml of the starve medium. Cells were incubated with 3 ml of starve medium containing [35S]methionine and [35S]cysteine (labeling medium) at a total concentration of 100 μCi ml−1 for the indicated times. For pulse-chase experiments, cells were radiolabeled as above, and the chase was initiated by the addition to the labeling medium of 7 ml of pre-warmed Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (with 1.5 mg ml−1 glucose) supplemented with 0.3 mg ml−1glutamine and containing 7.1 mm cycloheximide andl-methionine, respectively. When required, exogenous reagents were present during the starve, pulse, and chase periods at the following concentrations: ascorbate at 50 μg ml−1, α,α′-dipyridyl at 0.3 mm, and azetidine-2-carboxylic acid at 10 mm. When required, ferrous ions were present during the chase period at a final concentration of 5 mm by the addition of solid Fe2(SO4)3 to the chase medium. All the following procedures were performed at 4 °C. After the completion of the labeling or chase periods, the cells were immediately lysed in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 2 mm EDTA, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 0.02% (w/v) NaN3, 0.1 mg ml−1 soybean trypsin inhibitor (SBTI), 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF)). When required, N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) was present in the PBS and lysis buffer at a concentration of 20 mm. Cells were lysed for 30 min, and the lysate was centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 15 min to remove nuclei and cell debris. Proteins present in the chase medium were precipitated by the addition of PEG as described above. B12 cells were radiolabeled for 1 h as described above and pelleted by centrifugation. Harvested cells were washed in PBS and resuspended in 100 μl of PBS. The cell suspension was mixed with 10 μl of freshly prepared 20 mmDSP in Me2SO and incubated at 4 °C for 30 min. Cells were washed with 2 mm glycine in PBS to quench the cross-linker, washed once with PBS, and resuspended in 200 μl of Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm PMSF, 0.1 mg ml−1 SBTI, 1 mmNEM). Cells were lysed at 4 °C for 30 min, and the lysate was centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 15 min. All sucrose solutions were prepared in gradient buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 1%(v/v) Nonidet P-40, 1 mm PMSF). Equal volumes of 25 and 5% (w/v) sucrose were differentially mixed using a gradient maker to create a 10-ml 5–25% gradient that was gradually layered onto 0.5 ml of 50% (w/v) sucrose in a Beckman SW-40 tube. All the following procedures were performed at 4 °C unless otherwise stated. Cells were radiolabeled as described above and lysed for 30 min in gradient buffer containing 0.1 mg ml−1 SBTI. The lysate was centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 15 min, and the supernatant was slowly layered onto a 9.5-ml 5–25% sucrose gradient. Proteins were separated through the gradient by centrifugation at 40,000 rpm (Beckmann SW-40 rotor) for 16 h. For the immunoprecipitation of proteins under denaturing conditions, 10% (w/v) SDS was added to the cell lysate supernatant or to PEG precipitates from medium to a final concentration of 0.5%, and the sample was boiled for 5 min. The sample was then diluted 10-fold with immunoprecipitation buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 2 mm EDTA, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 0.02% (w/v) NaN3) and centrifuged for 15 min to remove non-solubilized material. Samples immunoprecipitated under native conditions were diluted directly into immunoprecipitation buffer. After the above preparations, 10% (w/v) protein A-Sepharose in PBS was added to the supernatants to a concentration of 0.5%, and the samples were incubated with gentle agitation for 1 h. The protein A-Sepharose was pelleted from the sample by centrifugation for 15 min, and the supernatant was incubated with gentle agitation overnight with 0.5% protein A-Sepharose and the appropriate antibody at the following concentrations: 1 μl of antibody/1-ml sample for SPA-470 and anti-calreticulin; 2 μl of antibody/1-ml sample for anti-PDI and anti-p57; and 5 μl of antibody/1-ml sample for anti-calnexin and anti-type III procollagen. For the anti-BiP and anti-GRP94 antibodies, protein G-Sepharose was used instead of protein A-Sepharose, and the antibodies were used at a concentration of 2 μl of antibody/1-ml sample. The immunocomplexes were pelleted by centrifugation for 30 s and washed twice with immunoprecipitation buffer, once with high salt buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 2 mm EDTA, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 500 mm NaCl, 0.02% (w/v) NaN3), and once again with immunoprecipitation buffer. The immunoprecipitates were then prepared for analysis by SDS- PAGE. F2 cells were plated to 80% confluence on 13-mm coverslips and cultured overnight in complete medium supplemented with 50 μg/ml ascorbate if required. The following procedures were performed at room temperature. Cells were washed twice in PBS and then fixed with 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde in PBS for 15 min. Three washes with PBS were followed by three with NaBH4 solution (0.5 mg/ml in PBS) to reduce autofluorescence, and where appropriate the cells were permeabilized with 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 0.5% (w/v) SDS in PBS for 4 min. The coverslips were rinsed in PBS before incubation with a 1/100 dilution of the anti-Myc mouse monoclonal antibody (9E10) for 1 h. After washing, incubation with a 1/40 dilution of a donkey anti-mouse Cy2 conjugate (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Buckinghamshire, UK) was performed for 1 h. Fractions from sucrose gradients were incubated with gentle agitation for 60 min with 10% (w/v) poly(l-proline)-Sepharose. The poly(l-proline) precipitate was pelleted by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 15 min and washed four times with P4-H buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.8, 0.1 m NaCl, 100 mm glycine, 0.1% Triton X-100). Proteins were eluted from the poly(l-proline)-Sepharose by incubating the precipitate with gentle agitation for 5 min in P4-H buffer containing 3 mg ml−1 poly(l-proline) (3000 kDa). Proteins were precipitated from the eluate by the addition of trichloroacetic acid to 15% (w/v) and acetone to 25% (v/v), and the sample was incubated with gentle agitation for 60 min. Precipitates were harvested by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 15 min, washed with acetone, and prepared for SDS-PAGE analysis. Immunoprecipitates were resuspended in SDS-PAGE buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 1% (w/v) SDS, 10% (v/v) glycerol, bromphenol blue) and boiled for 5 min in either the absence (non-reducing) or presence (reducing) of 50 mmdithiothreitol. Samples were subjected to electrophoresis through a polyacrylamide gel, and the dried gels were visualized by autoradiography using Kodak BIOMAX film. The primary purpose of this study was to investigate the molecular mechanism leading to the retention of partially folded procollagen chains within the ER. To facilitate this study we first constructed a cell line expressing a procollagen “mini-chain,” designated pro-α1(III)Δ1, that we have previously studied using a semi-permeabilized cell expression system (31Wilson R. Allen A.J. Oliver J. Brookman J.L. High S. Bulleid N.J. Biochem. J. 1995; 307: 679-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). These experiments have shown that procollagen “mini-chains” translated in the presence of SP cells are efficiently translocated, modified, and assembled into a correctly aligned triple helix (25Bulleid N.J. Wilson R. Lees J.F. Biochem. J. 1996; 317: 195-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Here we used HT1080 as the host cell line because these cells do not express any fibril-forming procollagens and have been shown to support the folding and assembly of types I and II procollagen (32Geddis A.E. Prockop D.J. Matrix. 1993; 13: 399-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 33Fertala A. Sieron A.L. Ganguly A. Li S.W. Ala-Kokko L. Anumula K.R. Prockop D.J. Biochem. J. 1994; 298: 31-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Our previous work with this procollagen polypeptide demonstrated that assembly occurred in distinct stages. Initially a trimer is formed that is stabilized by inter-chain disulfides within the C-propeptide. Once sufficient proline residues within the triple helical domain are hydroxylated, the triple helix folds in a C to N direction resulting in the N-propeptide associating and forming interchain disulfide bonds. Thus the formation of interchain disulfides within the N-propeptide does not occur until the triple helical domain has folded. These two disulfide-bonded intermediates can be separated by non-reducing SDS-PAGE allowing an evaluation of the folding status of the expressed procollagen chains (25Bulleid N.J. Wilson R. Lees J.F. Biochem. J. 1996; 317: 195-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Cell lines expressing pro-α1(III)Δ1 were isolated as individual clones, and one of these cell lines, designated B12, was used for this study. To determine the folding status of the pro-α1(III)Δ1 chains synthesized in this cell line, we pulse-labeled newly synthesized proteins and specifically immunoprecipitated the pro-α1(III)Δ1 chains from cell lystates. The resulting immunoprecipitates were then separated under reducing and non-reducing conditions (Fig. 1). The cells were radiolabeled in the presence or absence of ascorbate (vitamin C), an essential co-factor of P4H. In the absence of added ascorbate P4H activity is reduced leading to the synthesis of underhydroxylated procollagen chains that do not form a triple helix. In the absence of added ascorbate, radiolabeled pro-α1(III)Δ1 chains were visualized under non-reducing conditions as two forms with apparent molecular masses of 292 and 210 kDa (Fig. 1B). These forms correspond to a trimer and dimer respectively stabilized by the formation of inter-chain disulfide bonds within the C-propeptide. In the presence of ascorbate the chains migrated predominantly with an apparent molecular mass of 260 kDa. We have shown previously that this form represents a trimer that is stabilized by the formation of inter-chain disulfide bonds within the C- and N-propeptide (25Bulleid N.J. Wilson R. Lees J.F. Biochem. J. 1996; 317: 195-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The higher mobility of this trimer relative to the trimer stabilized by inter-chain disulfide bonds within the C-propeptide only is a result of a decrease in the hydrodynamic volume (34Fessler L.I. Timpl R. Fessler J.H. J..Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 2531-2537Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). These results demonstrate that the pro-α1(III)Δ1 synthesized in this cell line folds to form a triple helical molecule when expressed in the presence of co-factors for P4H and that we can distinguish between two disulfide-bonded intermediates by carrying out electrophoresis under non-reducing conditions. For simplicity these intermediates will subsequently be referred to as a non-helical or helical trimer. Incubating the B12 cell line in the absence of ascorbate clearly prevents folding of the procollagen molecule leading to a build-up of non-helical trimer. To investigate whether the cells could recognize this intermediate and retain it within the cell, we examined the effect of ascorbate depletion on the secretion of pro-α1(III)Δ1 chains. Proteins synthesized by B12 cells were radiolabeled and chased over a 180-min period (Fig. 2). Pro-α1(III)Δ1 chains were immunoprecipitated from the cell lysates (Fig. 2A) and from the medium (Fig. 2B). Immunoprecipitated proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions. In the presence of ascorbate, pro-α1(III)Δ1 chains were secreted into the medium after 40 min of chase with a maximal level of secretion of radiolabeled protein at 80 min of chase (Fig. 2B). In the absence of added ascorbate, very little radiolabeled material was secreted, the small amount present in the medium after 80 min of chase probably representing a minimal amount of protein that folds even in the absence of added ascorbate (see Fig. 1B, 40 min). Thus, it would appear that in the absence of added ascorbate the non-helical trimers formed are retained within the cell. This retention could be a consequence of the ascorbate having a general effect on protein secretion rather than its role as a co-factor of P4H. We investigated this possibility by using an alternative approach to inhibit P4H activity. Along with ascorbate and oxygen, iron is an essential co-factor of this enzyme (10Kivirikko K.I. Myllylä R. Pihlajaniemi T. Harding J.J. Crabbe M.J.C. Post-translational Modification of Proteins. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1992: 1-51Google Scholar). Chemicals that chelate iron such as α,α′-dipyridyl are inhibitors of this enzyme and have been shown to be effective when added to cells grown in culture leading to the under-hydroxylation of procollagen (35Berg R.A. Prockop D.J. Biochemistry. 1973; 12: 3395-3401Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). In the present study, a pulse labeling and chase experiment was carried out using B12 cells incubated in the presence of α,α′-dipyridyl (Fig. 3). Here no pro-α1(III)Δ1 chains were secreted even after 180 min of chase (Fig. 3B, lanes 1–5) with all the radiolabeled chains remaining within the cell (Fig. 3A, lanes 1–5). When these samples were separated under non-reducing conditions the pro-α1(III)Δ1 chains separated as non-helical trimers (results not shown). When B12 cells were labeled in the presence of α,α′-dipyridyl and then incubated in medium containing iron and protein synthesis inhibitor, a reversal of this block in secretion was observed (Fig. 3B, lanes 18–20)"

K protein is phosphorylated in vivo andin vitro by inducible kinase(s) and contains several potential sites for protein kinase C (PKC) phosphorylation. In this study we show that K protein is phosphorylated in vitro by PKCδ and by other PKCs. Deletion analysis and site-directed mutagenesis revealed that Ser302 is a major K protein site phosphorylated by PKCδ in vitro. This residue is located in the middle of a short amino acid fragment that divides the two clusters of SH3-binding domains. Mutation of Ser302decreased the level of phosphorylation of exogenously expressed K protein in phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-treated COS cells, suggesting that Ser302 is also a site for PKC-mediated phosphorylation in vivo. In vitro, PKCδ binds K protein via the highly interactive KI domain, an interaction that is blocked by poly(C) RNA. Mutation of Ser302 did not alter the K protein-PKCδ interaction in vitro, suggesting that phosphorylation of this residue alone is not sufficient to alter this interaction. Instead, binding of PKCδ to K protein in vitro and in vivo was greatly increased by K protein phosphorylation on tyrosine residues. The ability of PKCδ to bind and phosphorylate K protein may serve not only to alter the activity of K protein itself, but K protein may also bridge PKCδ to other K protein molecular partners and thus facilitate molecular cross-talk. The regulated nature of the PKCδ-K protein interaction may serve to meet cellular needs at sites of active transcription, RNA processing and translation in response to changing extracellular environment.

K protein has a diverse repertoire of molecular partners that are involved in signal transduction and gene expression. K protein binds with RNA, single-stranded, and double-stranded DNA, and it associates with a number of transcriptional activators and repressors, including TATA-binding protein (1Bomsztyk K.

K protein shuttles between the nucleus and cytoplasm and therefore could serve as a vehicle that is involved in RNA transport (15Michael W.M. Eder P.S. Dreyfuss G.

Alternatively, the Vav- and/or tyrosine kinases-K protein interaction may regulate K protein transcriptional and/or translational activity. Considering the diversity of K protein molecular interactions, it is not surprising that new reports are emerging implicating K protein involvement in viral processes. For example, K protein has been shown to functionally interact with hepatitis C virus core protein (17Hsieh T.Y. Matsumoto M. Chou H.C. Schneider R. Hwang S.B. Lee A.S. Lai M.M.C. J. Biol.

The latter sites are contained within the same region that binds several transcriptional repressors, such as Zik1 (21Denisenko O.N. O'Neill B. Ostrowski J. Van Seuningen I. Bomsztyk K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27701-27706Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), as well as the global regulator of anterior-posterior patterning, Eed (22Denisenko O.N. Bomsztyk K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4707-4717Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). This module is adjacent to a nuclear shuttling domain, KNS (15Michael W.M. Eder P.S. Dreyfuss G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3587-3598Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar), that may mediate direct coupling of K protein to a bona fide nuclear/cytoplasmic shuttling transporter(s). Finally, a domain near the C terminus recruits an interleukin-1-responsive kinase that phosphorylates K protein in a nucleic acid-dependent fashion (3Van Seuningen I. Ostrowski J. Bustelo X. Sleath P. Bomsztyk K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26976-26985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 4Van Seuningen I. Ostrowski J. Bomsztyk K. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 5644-5650Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Although K protein is already known to contain a number of binding domains, it seems that there are potentially others that remain to be identified. The abundant and ubiquitous expression of K protein, its multimodular structure, its potential to oligomerize via its two different dimerization domains, and its apparent involvement in a wide range of processes responsible for transcription, translation, and signal transduction suggest that K protein may act as a scaffold or docking platform. Alternatively, K protein may be a multifunctional factor that is involved in processes that are not directly related. In either scenario the function of K protein is likely to be regulated by post-translational modification and by cognate nucleic acid motifs. K protein is phosphorylated in vivo and in vitroon serine and threonine residues (5Ostrowski J. Sims J.E. Sibley C.H. Valentine M.A. Dower S.K. Meier K.E. Bomsztyk K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12722-12733Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Dejgaard K. Leffers H. Rasmussen H.H. Madsen P. Kruse T.A. Gesser B. Nilesen H. Celis J.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 236: 33-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). At least in part, this phosphorylation is mediated by an associated kinase(s) that can respond to treatment of cells with interleukin-1 and other agents (4Van Seuningen I. Ostrowski J. Bomsztyk K. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 5644-5650Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 5Ostrowski J. Sims J.E. Sibley C.H. Valentine M.A. Dower S.K. Meier K.E. Bomsztyk K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12722-12733Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, K protein phosphorylation is likely to play a key role in the regulation of its activity. This postulate is supported by the observation that the binding of K protein to poly(C) in vitro is diminished by phosphorylation (23Dejgaard K. Leffers H. Rasmussen H.H. Madsen P. Kruse T.A. Gesser B. Nilesen H. Celis J.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 236: 33-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Moreover, in hepatocytes following systemic administration of lipopolysaccharide into rats, there was a complete dissociation of the transcriptional factor C/EBPβ from K protein (11Miau L.H. Chang C.J. Shen B.J. Tsai W.-H. Lee S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10784-10791Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), a process that may reflect phosphorylation of K protein. Analysis of the K protein amino acid sequence reveals a number of potential phosphorylation sites by casein kinase II, protein kinase C (PKC), and tyrosine kinases. Indeed, in vitro, K protein is an excellent substrate for casein kinase II (24Ostrowski J. Van Seuningen I. Seger R. Rouch C.T. Sleath P.R. McMullen B.A. Bomsztyk K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17626-17634Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, casein kinase II is typically a constitutively active enzyme (25Manak J.R. de Bisschop N. Kris R.M. Prywes R. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 955-967Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), making its role in the inducible phosphorylation of K protein in vivo less likely than the role of inducible serine/threonine kinases such as the PKC family of enzymes. The PKC family of enzymes transduce intracellular signals that regulate many different intracellular processes (26Nishizuka Y. Nature. 1984; 308: 693-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (5764) Google Scholar). This heterogenous family of enzymes is divided into three classes based on their Ca2+ and lipid requirements (27Jaken S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 168-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). The conventional PKCs (α, β, and γ) require phosphatidylserine, diacylglycerol, or phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), and Ca2+; the novel subgroup of PKCs (δ, ε, η, μ, and θ) are Ca2+-independent but require the other two co-factors; and finally the least understood subgroup of PKCs (ζ and λ) are both Ca2+- and diacylglycerol-independent. Among the PKC isoenzymes, PKCδ has unique properties that suggest a functional connection to K protein. First, PKCδ phosphorylates elongation factor 1α (28Kielbassa K. Muller H.J. Meyer H.E. Marks F. Gschwendt M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6156-6162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), a factor that binds K protein (29Bomsztyk K. Van Seuningen I. Suzuki H. Denisenko O.N. Ostrowski J. FEBS Lett. 1997; 403: 113-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Second, K protein interacts with Src-tyrosine kinases, a class of enzymes that phosphorylate PKCδ (30Zang Q. Lu Z. Curto M. Barile N. Shalloway D. Foster D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 272: 13275-13280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Third, K protein contains several potential PKC phosphorylation sites. Because K protein contains sites for PKC phosphorylation and because PKCδ and K protein share molecular partners, in this study we explored the possibility that K protein is a PKCδ substrate. The murine thymoma EL-4 6.1 C10 (31Lowenthal J.W. MacDonald H.R. J. Exp. Med. 1986; 164: 1060-1074Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) and human thymoma Jurkat cell line was grown in suspension. Cells were grown at 37 °C in complete RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum or Fetal Clone (Hyclone), 2 mm glutamine, 50 μm β-mercaptoethanol, 100 units/ml penicillin, 0.01% streptomycin, and humidified with 7/93% C02/air gas mixture. The monkey COS cells (32Kluxen F.W. Lubbert H. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 208: 352-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) were grown in Dulbecco's minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 0.01% streptomycin and humidified with 7/93% C02/air gas mixture. The bacterial expression vector pGEX-KT was provided by Dr. J. Dixon (University of Michigan). Glutathione-agarose beads, reduced glutathione, and PMA were obtained from Sigma. Fast Flow Protein A-Sepharose was obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Polyclonal anti-K protein antibody 54 was made in rabbits as described previously (4Van Seuningen I. Ostrowski J. Bomsztyk K. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 5644-5650Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Monoclonal antiphosphotyrosine and polyclonal anti-PKCδ antibody was purchased from Santa Cruz and anti-PKCδ monoclonal antibody was purchased from Transduction Laboratories. Baculovirus expressed and spleen PKCδ were produced as described previously (33Leibersperger H. Gschwendt M. Marks F. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 16108-16115Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34Zang R. Muller H.J. Kielbassa K. Marks F. Gschwendt M. Biochem.

The following buffers were used: PKC phosphorylation buffer, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 10 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm PMA, 10 mg phosphatidylserine, 18.75 mm ATP, and 3.7 mCi of [γ-32P]ATP; PKC binding buffer, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 10 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, and 1 mm PMA; Lck phosphorylation buffer, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mmMnCl2, 100 μm ATP, 1 mmdithiothreitol, and 0.1% Triton X-100; Escherichia coliextraction buffer, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 2 mmEDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mg/ml leupeptin, and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; standard binding buffer, 5 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 25 mmNaCl, and 0.05% Nonidet P-40; HKMT buffer, 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.1%Triton X-100, and 100 mm KCl; washing buffer, 5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 175 mm NaCl, 1.0 mm EDTA, and 1.0% Nonidet P-40; SDS-loading buffer, 60 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, and 5% β-mercaptoethanol; TBST buffer, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.05% Tween 20; and IP buffer, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and 1.0% Triton X-100. Nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts were prepared by a modified version of the method of Dignam et al. (35Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9164) Google Scholar) as described previously (5Ostrowski J. Sims J.E. Sibley C.H. Valentine M.A. Dower S.K. Meier K.E. Bomsztyk K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12722-12733Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin, lysis, extraction, and dilution buffers contained the following phosphatase inhibitors (all from Sigma): 30 mm p-nitrophenyl phosphate, 10 mm NaF, 0.1 mmNa3VO4, 0.1 mmNa2MoO4, and 10 mmβ-glycerophosphate. Protein content was measured using the DC method (Pierce). GST-K, GST-K3, GST-K, GST-K10, GST-K12, GST-K13, and GST-K14 were constructed as described (3Van Seuningen I. Ostrowski J. Bustelo X. Sleath P. Bomsztyk K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26976-26985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). For the GST-K31 deletion mutant, polymerase chain reaction was used to introduce a BamHI site immediately upstream of Met240 and to introduce a stop codon followed by anEcoRI site downstream of Val337. GST-K31 was created by cloning this excised fragment into pGEX-KT. For the GST-KΔPB deletion mutant, pGEX-K was cut with PpuMI andBglII, then filled in with Klenow fragment, and religated to create the GST-KΔPB construct. For Flag-K for mammalian expression, K protein was excised from pM1-K (22Denisenko O.N. Bomsztyk K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4707-4717Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) with EcoRI andSalI and then ligated into p18Flag that had been cut withEcoRI and XhoI, creating the recombinant Flag-K. The point mutations of Ser302 to Ala or Glu in GST-K, GST-K31, and Flag-K were generated using the QuickChange Site-Directed Mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). All plasmids were purified by CsCl gradient before use in transient transfections, and the mutations were confirmed by automated sequencing using the DyeDeoxy Terminator Cycle Sequencing kit (PE Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). GST fusion proteins were expressed in either BRL or BL21 (DE3) pLysS cells (Novagen, Madison, WI) using a modified manufacturer's protocol. Transformed cells were grown until they reachedA 600 = 0.6 and then were treated for 3 h with 1.0 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside. Following freezing and thawing, pellets were resuspended in E. coli extraction buffer and sonicated. Fusion proteins were recovered in the supernatant after centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 30 min (4 °C). GST-K and GST-K deletion mutants were then purified on a glutathione column as described previously (3Van Seuningen I. Ostrowski J. Bustelo X. Sleath P. Bomsztyk K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26976-26985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). In vitrotranscription and translation was performed using the TNT T7 Quick Coupled Transcription/Translation System as per the manufacturer's protocol (Promega, Madison, WI) Binding to beads was carried out by mixing glutathione beads with the standard binding buffer containing a given protein or RNA at 4 °C. After extensive washes, proteins were eluted from the beads by boiling in 1× SDS-loading buffer (36Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207538) Google Scholar) and were then loaded on a 10% SDS gel and autoradiographed. COS cells were grown in Dulbecco's minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum to approximately 60–75% confluency in 100-mm diameter dishes and were transfected using SuperFect Transfection Reagent as per the manufacturer's protocol (Qiagen Inc., Santa Clarita, CA). K protein is phosphorylated in vivo and in vitro on serine residues by a kinase(s) with which it forms a complex (5Ostrowski J. Sims J.E. Sibley C.H. Valentine M.A. Dower S.K. Meier K.E. Bomsztyk K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12722-12733Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Dejgaard K. Leffers H. Rasmussen H.H. Madsen P. Kruse T.A. Gesser B. Nilesen H. Celis J.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 236: 33-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Analysis of K protein amino acid sequence reveals a number of potential sites for phosphorylation by PKC. To test whether K protein is a substrate for this class of enzymes, purified bacterially expressed full-length GST-K fusion protein was phosphorylated in solution by purified porcine spleen PKCδ in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP. The kinase reaction was terminated by boiling the sample with loading buffer and then separated by SDS-PAGE. Phosphorylation of GST-K protein was assessed by scintillation counting of the 32P-labeled GST-K bands cut from the gel (Fig. 1). The results showed that PKCδ phosphorylates K protein in vitroand that the rate of phosphate incorporation was dependent on GST-K protein concentration. Under these conditions, phosphorylation of GST-K had a V max of 286 pmol phosphate/min/mg PKCδ and a K m of 1.9 nm (Fig. 1B). These results show that under these conditions the velocity of phosphorylation of GST-K by PKCδ was relatively slow, but the lowK m suggests that K protein may bind PKCδ with a high affinity. As expected, phosphorylation of K protein by PKCδ is dependent on phosphatidylserine and PMA and does not require Ca2+ (data not shown). A series of GST-K deletion mutants (Fig. 2A) (3Van Seuningen I. Ostrowski J. Bustelo X. Sleath P. Bomsztyk K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26976-26985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) was used to identify a domain that is phosphorylated by PKCδ. Glutathione beads bearing either full-length GST-K or one of the deletion mutants were phosphorylated by baculovirus expressed PKCδ (28Kielbassa K. Muller H.J. Meyer H.E. Marks F. Gschwendt M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6156-6162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 37Stempka L. Girod A. Muller H.-J. Rincke G. Marks F. Gschwendt M. Bossemeyer D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6805-6811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The kinase reaction was terminated by washing the beads with HKMT buffer, proteins were eluted from the beads by boiling in SDS loading buffer, and the level of phosphorylation of GST-K fusion proteins was assessed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography (Fig. 2B). In addition to phosphorylating the full-length GST-K, PKCδ also phosphorylated GST-K13 (a.a. 1–337), GST-K3 (a.a. 171–337), and GST-K31 (a.a. 240–337) deletion mutants. In contrast, the deletion mutants GST-K12 (a.a. 1–209) and GST-K7 (a.a. 318–464) were not phosphorylated at all. These results indicated that the PKCδ site(s) is contained within the GST-K31 deletion mutant (a.a. 240–337). This domain contains three serines, Ser276, Ser284, and Ser302, and no threonines. Ser302 is located within a good consensus for PKC-mediated phosphorylation, Arg-Gly-Gly-Ser-Arg-Ala-Arg (24Ostrowski J. Van Seuningen I. Seger R. Rouch C.T. Sleath P.R. McMullen B.A. Bomsztyk K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17626-17634Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Kielbassa K. Muller H.J. Meyer H.E. Marks F. Gschwendt M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6156-6162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). To test whether Ser302 is the site that is phosphorylated in vitro by PKCδ, site-directed mutagenesis was used to mutate this residue to either Ala (GST-KS302A and GST-K31S302A) or Glu (GST-KS302E and GST-K31S302E) (Fig. 2A). These mutants were tested as substrates for phosphorylation by PKCδ. As before, the phosphorylation reactions were carried out on beads bearing GST-K fusion proteins (Fig. 2). Autoradiographs from these phosphorylation reactions are shown in Fig. 2C. In sharp contrast to the full-length GST-K, the point mutants GST-KS302A and GST-KS302E were poorly or not at all phosphorylated by PKCδ. Although the GST-K31S302A and GST-K31S302E mutants were phosphorylated, the level of phosphorylation of these Ser302 mutants was much lower than that observed with the wild-type GST-K31. These results indicate that Ser302 is the major site for phosphorylation of GST-K protein by PKCδ in vitro, whereas Ser277and/or Ser284 are only minor site(s). This is supported by the observation that an internal deletion mutant that lacks the proline-rich SH3-binding domains, GST-KΔPB (a.a. 288–321 deleted), was a very poor substrate for PKCδ (data not shown). We used the above approach to determine whether K protein is a substrate for other PKC isoforms. Beads bearing different GST-K protein mutants (Fig. 3A) were phosphorylated by a partially purified mixture of PKCα, β, and γ. As with PKCδ, GST-K and GST-K31 were phosphorylated by PKCα, β, and γ, whereas GST-K7 (a.a. 318–464) was not phosphorylated at all, and the level of phosphorylation of the internal deletion mutant that lacks the two clusters of the proline-rich SH3-binding domains (3Van Seuningen I. Ostrowski J. Bustelo X. Sleath P. Bomsztyk K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26976-26985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), GST-KΔPB (a.a. 288–321 deleted) was very low (Fig. 3B). Because the deleted a.a. 288–321 region contains no other phosphorylation sites, the markedly decreased level of phosphorylation of the GST-KΔPB mutant suggests that Ser302 is also a major K protein site for phosphorylation by the calcium-dependent PKCα, β, and γ. The level of PKCα-, β-, and γmediated phosphorylation of GST-KS302A, GST-KS302E, GST-K31S302A, and GST-K31S302E mutants was lower compared with their respective wild-type GST-K fusion proteins (Fig. 3C), providing further evidence that Ser302 is a major site of phosphorylation by these PKC isoforms in vitro. K protein is phosphorylated in vivo on serine residues (5Ostrowski J. Sims J.E. Sibley C.H. Valentine M.A. Dower S.K. Meier K.E. Bomsztyk K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12722-12733Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, to determine whether Ser302 can also be phosphorylatedin vivo, we compared the levels of phosphorylation of wild-type Flag-K and of point mutant Flag-KS302A(Ser302 → Ala) that were co-expressed with HA-PKCδ in COS cells. Transfected cells were metabolically labeled with [32P]orthophosphate and were then treated with or wi"

The purified enzyme exists in two forms when visualized by reduced SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis: (i) intact EC-SOD (Trp1–Ala222) containing the C-terminal heparin-binding domain and (ii) cleaved EC-SOD (Trp1–Glu209) without the C-terminal heparin-binding domain. The proteolytic event(s) leading to proteolysis at Glu209–Arg210 and removal of the heparin-binding domain are not known, but may represent an important regulatory mechanism. Removal of the heparin-binding domain affects both the affinity of EC-SOD for and its distribution to the extracellular matrix, in which it is secreted. During the purification of human EC-SOD, the intact/cleaved ratio remains constant, suggesting that proteolytic removal of the heparin-binding domain does not occur during purification (Oury, T. D., Crapo, J. D., Valnickova, Z., and Enghild, J. J. (1996) Biochem. J. 317, 51–57). This was supported by the finding that fresh mouse tissue contains both intact and cleaved EC-SOD. To study other possible mechanisms leading to the formation of cleaved EC-SOD, we examined biosynthesis in cultured rat L2 epithelial-like cells using a pulse-chase protocol. The results of these studies suggest that the heparin-binding domain is removed intracellularly just prior to secretion. In addition, the intact/cleaved EC-SOD ratio appears to be tissue-dependent, implying that the intracellular processing event is regulated in a tissue-specific manner. The existence of this intracellular processing pathway may thus represent a novel regulatory pathway for affecting the distribution and effect of EC-SOD.

Reactive oxygen species such as superoxide, hydrogen peroxide, and hydroxyl radical (O⨪2, H2O2, and OH⋅, respectively) are important in several pathophysiologic events, including inflammation, mutagenesis, and aging. Leukocytes, when activated, produce large amounts of reactive oxygen species. Although this is beneficial in host defense, it may have detrimental effects on the cells and extracellular matrix in the vicinity of the response. Because reactive oxygen species damage cells and the extracellular matrix, several defense mechanisms have evolved to protect against oxidant injury. Central to these defense mechanisms are the antioxidant enzymes. These include the superoxide dismutases, catalase, and glutathione peroxidase.The superoxide dismutases (SODs) 1The abbreviations used are: SODs, superoxide dismutases; EC-SOD, extracellular superoxide dismutase; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography. 1The abbreviations used are: SODs, superoxide dismutases; EC-SOD, extracellular superoxide dismutase; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography. (EC 1.15.1.1) catalyze the dismutation of two superoxide radicals into hydrogen peroxide and oxygen. These enzymes obey first-order reaction kinetics, and the forward rate constants are almost diffusion-limited (>109m−1 s−1) (1Forman H.J. Fridovich I. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1973; 158: 396-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). This results in a steady-state concentration of superoxide in tissue that varies directly with the rate of superoxide generation and inversely with the tissue concentration of scavenging enzymes (2Fridovich I. Pryor W.A. 1st Ed. Free Radicals in Biology. 1. Academic Press, New York1976: 239-277Google Scholar). The three isozymes of superoxide dismutase in mammals include Cu/Zn-SOD, Mn-SOD, and EC-SOD. EC-SOD is a heparin-binding multimer composed of disulfide-linked dimers (see Fig. 1) (3Marklund S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 7634-7638Crossref PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar, 4Oury T.D. Crapo J.D. Valnickova Z. Enghild J.J. Biochem. J. 1996; 317: 51-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Similar to intracellular Cu/Zn-SOD, EC-SOD contains both copper and zinc (3Marklund S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 7634-7638Crossref PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar). EC-SOD is the primary extracellular antioxidant enzyme and is highly expressed in the lungs of humans, where it is produced in the alveolar septa by type 2 epithelial cells (5Su W.Y. Folz R.

In arteries, EC-SOD constitutes up to 70% of the total SOD activity (9Oury T.D. Day B.J. Crapo J.D. Free Radical Biol. Med. 1996; 20: 957-965Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar) and may play a pivotal role in regulating the bioavailability of nitric oxide in vessel walls, airways, and lung tissue. The reaction of nitric oxide with superoxide is diffusion-limited, allowing low levels of extracellular superoxide to interfere with the signaling of nitric oxide in smooth muscle relaxation and neurotransmission and in controlling inflammation. By scavenging extracellular superoxide, EC-SOD can enhance these nitric oxide responses.The heparin-binding domains of two EC-SOD subunits are linked by a disulfide bond to form a cluster of 12 positively charged amino acid residues (Fig. 1) (4Oury T.D. Crapo J.D. Valnickova Z. Enghild J.J. Biochem. J. 1996; 317: 51-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). These residues provide the basis for the electrostatic interactions with heparan sulfate, which anchors EC-SOD to specific regions of the extracellular matrix and on cell surfaces (6Folz R.J.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 7634-7638Crossref PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar). The heterogeneous heparin affinity is a result of proteolysis of the heparin-binding domain (13Sandstrom J. Carlsson L. Marklund S.L. Edlund T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18205-18209Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Proteases such as trypsin specifically cleave the heparin-binding domain of native EC-SOD in vitro; however, the protease(s) responsible for this cleavage in vivo are unknown. Regulation of this proteolytic event may be an important control point in modulating EC-SOD activity in the extracellular matrix of tissues.Figure 2Modulation of EC-SOD heparin affinity.EC-SOD is a tetramer composed of two disulfide-linked dimers (4Oury T.D. Crapo J.D. Valnickova Z. Enghild J.J. Biochem. J. 1996; 317: 51-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The heparin-binding domain contains six positively charged amino acids (Arg-Lys-Lys-Arg-Arg-Arg) and is located in the C terminus of each molecule as indicated (13Sandstrom J. Carlsson L. Marklund S.L. Edlund T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18205-18209Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Truncation of the C-terminal region does not affect the noncovalent protein-protein interactions stabilizing the tetramer (4Oury T.D. Crapo J.D. Valnickova Z. Enghild J.J. Biochem. J. 1996; 317: 51-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), but affects the heparin-binding properties significantly. Three forms of EC-SOD are thought to exist in vivo: type A, with all four C termini truncated and therefore no heparin affinity; type B, with partial C-terminal truncation and medium heparin affinity; and type C, with all four C-terminal domains intact and high heparin affinity (3Marklund S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 7634-7638Crossref PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar). The existence of these variants suggests that the heparin affinity of EC-SOD is modulated by the degree of C-terminal proteolysis.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The number of physiologic and pathologic processes in which EC-SOD is found to be an important mediator continues to expand. This study shows that the C terminus of purified cleaved EC-SOD is Glu209and that the proteolytic conversion of intact EC-SOD is an intracellular process. This processing pathway may therefore represent a novel regulatory mechanism for controlling superoxide concentrations in tissues.DISCUSSIONSteady-state concentrations of the superoxide anion are directly proportional to the rate of production and inversely proportional to the concentration of scavenging enzymes such as the superoxide dismutases. EC-SOD is the only enzymatic scavenger of superoxide in the extracellular matrices of tissues. Thus, alterations in EC-SOD activity will have important consequences on the steady-state concentrations of superoxide in the extracellular spaces of tissues. Therefore, if there is increased synthesis of EC-SOD, there will be a decrease in the steady state of superoxide in the matrix in which EC-SOD is secreted. Conversely, if there is proteolytic removal of the heparin-binding domain, EC-SOD will lose its affinity for the extracellular matrix and diffuse out of the tissue. This will result in decreased EC-SOD activity and lead to an increase in the steady-state concentration of superoxide in this domain.The effect of C-terminal truncation will depend on the tissue in which it is residing. For example, in the lung, this may allow EC-SOD to diffuse from the alveolar septa into the alveolar fluid, where it can then prevent superoxide-mediated damage to surfactant. This study has examined the proteolytic processing of the heparin domain of EC-SOD and suggests that proteolytic regulation of the heparin-binding domain is an intracellular, tissue-specific event.EC-SOD Is Found in Tissues Both in the Intact and Cleaved FormsPurified EC-SOD migrates as a 60- and 30-kDa band on unreduced SDS-PAGE. The 30-kDa band is produced by proteolysis of the Glu209–Arg210 peptide bond, which results in dissociation of the disulfide-bound 60-kDa dimer. We initially investigated if this cleavage event was the result of fortuitous proteolysis during the purification of EC-SOD. However, rigorous attempts to control the proteolysis were unsuccessful. Since the level of cleaved EC-SOD remained the same regardless of the steps taken to prevent proteolysis, we hypothesized that cleaved EC-SOD may be present within tissues in vivo.Tissues from mice that had been perfused with a protease inhibitor-containing buffer were examined for evidence of cleaved EC-SOD. This perfusion procedure removed all blood and eliminated interference from cleaved EC-SOD present in the blood. The homogenized tissue supernatants were analyzed by SDS-PAGE within minutes of the perfusion. These analyses show that EC-SOD is present in both the cleaved and uncleaved forms in the matrices of tissues in vivo. Moreover, the results suggest that the proteolytic processing is an in vivo event and not an artifact that occurs during the purification of the enzyme. Evaluation of the EC-SOD composition in different organs reveals that the ratio between intact and cleaved EC-SOD varies considerably between different tissues. The heart shows almost exclusively intact EC-SOD, whereas lung tissue contains equal amounts of the two forms, suggesting that the regulation of EC-SOD proteolysis is tissue-specific.Biosynthesis Data Indicate That EC-SOD Is Cleaved IntracellularlyThe biosynthesis of EC-SOD was examined by a pulse-chase metabolic labeling protocol that has been previously employed to analyze intracellular processing events (16Thøgersen I.B. Enghild J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18700-18709Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 17Salvesen G. Enghild J.J. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 5304-5308Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). In this case, cultured rat lung L2 epithelial-like cells were maintained in multiple-tissue culture plates and briefly labeled using [35S]Met. After the pulse, each tissue culture plate was chased with nonradioactive cell culture medium for timed intervals. Following the completion of the chase periods, EC-SOD was immunoprecipitated and subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. The protein bands were visualized by autoradiography, and relevant bands were analyzed by radiosequencing. This allowed us to confirm both the identity and the integrity of immunoprecipitated bands. These experiments demonstrate that cleaved EC-SOD is present in the cell culture medium immediately upon secretion. Cleaved EC-SOD was not observed in the cell lysate, suggesting that the proteolytic event took place late in the biosynthesis pathway, most likely in the secretory vesicles or possibly in the Golgi apparatus. The cleaved/intact EC-SOD ratio in the medium remained constant for the duration of the experiment.To confirm that the processing event occurred before secretion, purified 125I-labeled EC-SOD was added to the medium of rat lung L2 epithelial-like cells cultured in serum-free medium. When EC-SOD is bound to heparin, the proteolysis of the heparin domain of EC-SOD is greatly diminished (21Karlsson K. Edlund A. Sandstrom J. Marklund S.L. Biochem. J. 1993; 290: 623-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). As a consequence of this, the heparin antagonist protamine was added to the cell culture medium to bind residual heparin and to ensure that the 125I-labeled EC-SOD heparin-binding domain was accessible for proteolysis. The lack of proteolysis after 30 h of incubation supports the conclusion that the processing of the EC-SOD heparin-binding domain is an intracellular event.Based on the analysis of recombinant EC-SOD mutants with altered C termini, it has been suggested that the heparin-binding domain is cleaved by an endoprotease and further trimmed by a carboxypeptidase (13Sandstrom J. Carlsson L. Marklund S.L. Edlund T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18205-18209Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Considering this scenario and that we have now shown that the C terminus of cleaved EC-SOD is Glu209 and thatthe initial cleavage site is intracellular, two possibilities seem likely: (i) the processing of EC-SOD is a one-step mechanism accomplished by a single intracellular endoproteolytic event cleaving the Glu209–Arg210 peptide bond, or alternatively, (ii) two proteases are involved. In the latter case, the initial intracellular endoproteolytic event is further toward the C terminus, and a carboxypeptidase specific for basic amino acid residues then trims the remaining basic amino acid residues to Glu209. This trimming could be intra- or extracellular. If the processing is a one-step mechanism cleaving at Glu209, the specificity of the processing enzyme would represent the “opposite” of most other processing proteases, which cleave at the C terminus of (di)basic residues (10Nakayama K. Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 625-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (701) Google Scholar, 14Seidah N.G. Chretien M. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 1997; 8: 602-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). This suggests that the EC-SOD processing is performed by a novel enzyme. However, at this point, it is not clear which of the proposed mechanisms is involved during the maturation of EC-SOD.Our results show that the proteolysis of EC-SOD is an intracellular process that is regulated differently in distinct tissues. The consequence of the proteolytic event is the removal of the EC-SOD heparin-binding domain and loss of heparin affinity. The cleaved EC-SOD subunit has no affinity for heparan sulfate proteoglycans expressed on the cell membrane and may thus diffuse into the surrounding tissue and fluids. In contrast, the heparin-binding intact EC-SOD is immobilized on cell surfaces and extracellular matrices where it is secreted. Thus, tissue-specific control of EC-SOD proteolytic processing allows for better regulation of the EC-SOD concentration, and thus the extracellular superoxide concentration, in specific extracellular domains. Reactive oxygen species such as superoxide, hydrogen peroxide, and hydroxyl radical (O⨪2, H2O2, and OH⋅, respectively) are important in several pathophysiologic events, including inflammation, mutagenesis, and aging. Leukocytes, when activated, produce large amounts of reactive oxygen species. Although this is beneficial in host defense, it may have detrimental effects on the cells and extracellular matrix in the vicinity of the response. Because reactive oxygen species damage cells and the extracellular matrix, several defense mechanisms have evolved to protect against oxidant injury. Central to these defense mechanisms are the antioxidant enzymes. These include the superoxide dismutases, catalase, and glutathione peroxidase. The superoxide dismutases (SODs) 1The abbreviations used are: SODs, superoxide dismutases; EC-SOD, extracellular superoxide dismutase; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography. 1The abbreviations used are: SODs, superoxide dismutases; EC-SOD, extracellular superoxide dismutase; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography. (EC 1.15.1.1) catalyze the dismutation of two superoxide radicals into hydrogen peroxide and oxygen. These enzymes obey first-order reaction kinetics, and the forward rate constants are almost diffusion-limited (>109m−1 s−1) (1Forman H.J. Fridovich I. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1973; 158: 396-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). This results in a steady-state concentration of superoxide in tissue that varies directly with the rate of superoxide generation and inversely with the tissue concentration of scavenging enzymes (2Fridovich I. Pryor W.A. 1st Ed. Free Radicals in Biology. 1. Academic Press, New York1976: 239-277Google Scholar). The three isozymes of superoxide dismutase in mammals include Cu/Zn-SOD, Mn-SOD, and EC-SOD. EC-SOD is a heparin-binding multimer composed of disulfide-linked dimers (see Fig. 1) (3Marklund S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 7634-7638Crossref PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar, 4Oury T.D. Crapo J.D. Valnickova Z. Enghild J.J. Biochem. J. 1996; 317: 51-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Similar to intracellular Cu/Zn-SOD, EC-SOD contains both copper and zinc (3Marklund S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 7634-7638Crossref PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar). EC-SOD is the primary extracellular antioxidant enzyme and is highly expressed in the lungs of humans, where it is produced in the alveolar septa by type 2 epithelial cells (5Su W.Y. Folz R.

Here we show that the transactivation domain (TAD) of zebrafish Pax6 is phosphorylated in vitro by the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) extracellular-signal regulated kinase (ERK) and p38 kinase but not by Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK). Three of four putative proline-dependent kinase phosphorylation sites are phosphorylated in vitro. Of these sites, the serine 413 (Ser413) is evolutionary conserved from sea urchin to man. Ser413 is also phosphorylatedin vivo upon activation of ERK or p38 kinase. Substitution of Ser413 with alanine strongly decreased the transactivation potential of the Pax6 TAD whereas substitution with glutamate increased the transactivation. Reporter gene assays with wild-type and mutant Pax6 revealed that transactivation by the full-length Pax6 protein from paired domain-binding sites was strongly enhanced (16-fold) following co-transfection with activated p38 kinase. This enhancement was largely dependent on the Ser413 site. ERK activation, however, produced a 3-fold increase in transactivation which was partly independent of the Ser413 site.

We have recently found that zebrafish contain two Pax6 genes,Pax6.1 and Pax6.2, which are expressed in both overlapping and distinct regions during development of the eyes and the central nervous system. Both these genes are able to induce ectopic eyes in Drosophila (18Nornes S. Clarkson M. Mikkola I. Pedersen M. Bardsley A. Martinez J.P. Krauss S. Johansen T. Mech. Dev. 1998; 77: 185-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The paired domain is a bipartite DNA-binding domain containing an N- and a C-terminal subdomain each with a helix-turn-helix motif (21Czerny T. Schaffner G. Busslinger M.

Cell. 1995; 80: 639-650Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). Pax6, like Pax3, Pax4, and Pax7, also harbors a second DNA-binding domain, the paired-type homeodomain (2Noll M.

In Pax6 this domain is separated from the N-terminal located paired domain by a flexible, acidic linker region (5Krauss S. Johansen T. Korzh V. Moens U. Ericson J.U. Fjose A.

The region C-terminal to the homeodomain is enriched in proline, serine, and threonine residues (PST-rich) and acts as a transactivation domain (TAD) (24Carriere C. Plaza S. Caboche J. Dozier C.

It has previously been shown that quail Pax6 proteins expressed in the neuroretina are phosphoproteins and phosphoamino acid analysis revealed phosphoserine and a minor proportion of phosphothreonine (28Carriere C.

The activity of many transcription factors is regulated in a rapid and reversible manner by specific phosphorylation events mediated by protein kinases acting in signaling cascades initiated by extracellular stimuli (reviewed in Refs. 29Karin M. Hunter T. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 747-757Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar and 30Treisman R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 205-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (1165) Google Scholar). Mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) are proline-directed serine/threonine protein kinases activated by heterogenous extracellular stimuli, including growth factors, hormones, cytokines, antigens, and physical-chemical stimuli such as oxidative stress, heat shock, osmotic imbalance, and UV light. MAPK cascades play essential roles in regulating many critical cellular processes, including cell growth and division, differentiation, apoptosis, and stress-related responses (reviewed in Refs. 31Robinson M.J. Cobb M.H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 180-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (2286) Google Scholar and 32Waskiewicz A.J. Cooper J.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 798-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar). These cascades are organized into modules of three protein kinases where a MAPK kinase kinase (e.g. Raf-1) activates a MAPK kinase (e.g. MEK1) which subsequently activates a MAPK (e.g. ERK1) (31Robinson M.J. Cobb M.H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 180-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (2286) Google Scholar, 33Marshall C.J. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1994; 4: 82-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (902) Google Scholar). Following activation the MAPKs translocate to the nucleus to phosphorylate nuclear substrates. Currently, four distinct MAPK cascades are known in vertebrates. However, more will probably be found since the budding yeast contains five such cascades that orchestrate responses to different physiological stimuli (34Sprague Jr., G.F. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2817-2820Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The extracellular-signal regulated kinase (ERK) pathway mainly conveys signals from mitogenic and differentiation stimuli. The same may be true for the most recently discovered ERK5/BMK1 pathway (35Kato Y. Tapping R.I. Huang S. Watson M.H. Ulevitch R.J. Lee J.D. Nature. 1998; 395: 713-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar) while the Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38 MAP kinase pathways seems mostly involved in transducing various stress- and cytokine-triggered signals to the nucleus. In each pathway several MAPK isoforms have been found with ERK1 and -2 in the ERK pathway, JNK1–3 in the JNK pathway and p38α-δ in the p38 MAPK pathway (reviewed in Ref. 31Robinson M.J. Cobb M.H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 180-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (2286) Google Scholar). A growing number of transcription factors have been identified as nuclear targets for MAPK pathways (reviewed in Ref. 30Treisman R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 205-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (1165) Google Scholar). Thus, c-Myc (36Gupta S. Davis R.J. FEBS Lett. 1994; 353: 281-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), Spi-B (37Mao C.

Science. 1997; 278: 1638-1641Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar) are targets of JNK, while CHOP (46Wang X.Z. Ron D. Science. 1996; 272: 1347-1349Crossref PubMed Scopus (743) Google Scholar) is a nuclear substrate for p38 kinase. This picture is further complicated by the fact that several transcription factors have been shown to be the targets of more than one MAPK pathway. Elk-1, a member of the ternary complex subfamily of ETS proteins, is targeted by all three pathways, while SAP-1 is activated upon phosphorylation by ERK or p38 kinase (Ref. 47Yang S.H. Whitmarsh A.J. Davis R.J. Sharrocks A.D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1740-1749Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar and references therein). Furthermore, MEF2C is phosphorylated by both p38 kinase and ERK5/BMK1 (48Kato Y. Kravchenko V.V. Tapping R.I. Han J. Ulevitch R.J. Lee J.D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7054-7066Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar) and ATF-2 and ATFa are targets of both the JNK and p38 kinase pathways (49Gupta S. Campbell D. Derijard B. Davis R.J. Science. 1995; 267: 389-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (1339) Google Scholar). Here we report for the first time that a Pax family transcription factor is phosphorylated in vitro and in vivo by MAP kinases. We found that three of the four putative MAPK phosphorylation sites in the Pax6 TAD is phosphorylated by ERK and p38 kinase, but not JNK, in vitro. One of these sites, Ser413, is conserved in Pax6 proteins from sea urchin to man and is also phosphorylated in vivo following activation of ERK or p38 kinase. Transient transfection studies with the Pax6 TAD fused to the DNA-binding domain of GAL4 and in the context of the full-length Pax6 protein revealed that mutation of this site to alanine strongly decreased the transactivating potential. Co-transfection of Pax6 with constitutively active MEK1 (which activates ERK1 and -2) or p38 kinase together with constitutively active MKK6b enhanced transcriptional activation by Pax6. However, while the potent p38 kinase-mediated increase in transactivation (16-fold) was largely dependent on the integrity of the Ser413 phosphorylation site, ERK activation gave a more modest enhancement of transactivation (3-fold) which was only reduced by 30% when this site was mutated to alanine. This suggests that activation of p38 kinase has a more direct positive effect on transactivation due to phosphorylation of the Pax6 TAD at Ser413 while ERK activation is less efficient and acting more indirectly. HeLa cells (ATCC CCL 2) were grown in Eagle's minimum essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (HyClone), nonessential amino acids (Life Technologies, Inc.), 2 mml-glutamine, penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml). NIH 3T3 fibroblasts (passage 123) were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC CRL 1658) and cultured in Dulbecco′s modified Eagle′s medium supplemented with 10% calf serum (HyClone, Logan, Utah), penicillin (100 units/ml), and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Life Technologies, Inc.) GAL4-Pax6 fusions were made by cloning parts of the zebrafish Pax6 coding region in-frame with the DNA-binding domain of yeast GAL4(1–147) in pSG424 (50Sadowski I. Ptashne M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 7539Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). All GAL4-Pax6 fusion constructs are named according to the included parts of the Pax6 protein with the amino acid positions shown in parentheses. GAL4-Pax6(174–437) was made by cloning the 1239-base pairPmlI-XbaI fragment of Pax6 into theSmaI-XbaI sites of pSG424. The 640-base pairMboII fragment containing the C-terminal TAD of Pax6 was inserted into the SmaI site of pSG424 to give GAL4-Pax6(299–437). GAL4-Pax6(299–395) was made from the 299–437 construct by deleting an internal NdeI-SacI fragment followed by religation. Similarly, GAL4-Pax6(299–374) was constructed by deleting the SpeI-SacI fragment from GAL4-Pax6(299–437). To construct GAL4-Pax6(299–352) aHindIII-SacI fragment was deleted from GAL4-Pax6(299–437). GAL4-Pax6(353–437) was made by ligation of aHindIII (made blunt)-XbaI fragment into theBamHI (made blunt)-XbaI sites of pSG424. GAL4-Pax6(374–437) was constructed from GAL4-Pax6(299–437) by deletion of the SpeI (made blunt)-HindIII fragment and ligation of the rest of the vector to aHindIII-SacI (made blunt) fragment from pSG424. GAL4-Pax6(396–437) was also derived from GAL4-Pax6(299–437) by deleting the NdeI (made blunt)-HindIII fragment followed by ligation of the rest of the vector to aHindIII-SmaI fragment from pSG424. GAL4-Pax6(374–395) was made from GAL4-Pax6(374–437) by cutting it with NdeI and SacI, making the ends blunt and religating them. GAL4-Pax6(353–374) was derived from GAL4-Pax6(353–437) by digestion with SpeI andXbaI, making the ends blunt, and religating them. The GAL4-Pax6(353–395) construct was made from GAL4-Pax6(353–437) by deletion of the NdeI-XbaI fragment followed by religation of the rest of the plasmid. GAL4-Pax6(Δ375–395) was derived from GAL4-Pax6(299–437) by an internal deletion of theNdeI-SpeI fragment. GAL4-Pax6(Δ353–375) was also made by an internal deletion of GAL4-Pax6(299–437) employing theHindIII and SpeI sites. Specific PCR primers (G4-P6(299) and pSG424.3′; see TableI) were used to transfer selected Pax6 constructs from pSG424 to pFA-CMV (Stratagene), where the expression of the GAL4-Pax6 fusions is driven by a CMV promoter. All constructs were verified by sequencing and the expression and correct sizes of fusion proteins following transfection of HeLa cells were verified by Western blotting.Table ISequences of oligonucleotides used as polymerase chain reaction primers for plasmid constructions and site-directed mutagenesis and as double-stranded binding site probes in gel mobility shift assaysNameSequenceG4-P6(299)5′-GCCGGGATCCCCTAATTCCTCAAGT-3′pSG424.3′5′-TGATCATTACTTATCTAGAGCTCGAATTC-3′5eukGST5′-ATAGGCTAGCCATGGCCCCTATACTAGGTTATTGG-3′3eukGST5′-ATTCACGCGTCCGCTATCGCTACGTGAC-3′S413E5′-CGG-GTT-TAA-TCG-AAC-CTG-GAG-TGT-CTG-3′T388E5′-CTA-TGA-CAC-ATA-CGA-ACC-CCC-GCA-C-3′S413A5′-CGG-GTT-TAA-TCG-CAC-CTG-GAG-TGT-C-3′S376E5′-GTT-GCC-CAC-TGA-ACC-TTC-AGT-AAA-CG-3′T388A5′-CTA-TGA-CAC-ATA-CGC-ACC-CCC-GCA-C-3′S376A5′-GTT-GCC-CAC-TGC-TCC-TTC-AGT-AAA-CG-3′T375A/S376A5′-CAT-GTT-GCC-CGC-TGC-TCC-TTC-AGT-AAA-C-3′T322A/T323A5′-CCC-TCA-GCC-CGC-AGC-GCC-AGT-ATC-C-3′P6CONbs5′-TGGAATTCAGGAAAAATTTTCACGCTTGAGTTCACAGCTCGAGTA-3′ Open table in a new tab The GST-Pax6(353–437) construct was made by ligating theHindIII (made blunt)-EcoRI Pax6 fragment into theSmaI-EcoRI site of pGEX-3X (Pharmacia).

The Pax6 expression vector pCI-Pax6 and the reporter vectors pG5E1bTATA-CAT, pTKG5CAT, and pG5E1bTATA-LUC have been described previously (18Nornes S. Clarkson M. Mikkola I. Pedersen M. Bardsley A.

In vitro mutagenesis was performed according to the instruction manual for the “Quick-Change Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit” (Stratagene). All mutagenized constructs were checked by sequencing. The specific mutagenesis primers used are shown in Table I. GST-Pax6 fusion proteins were purified from Escherichia coli LE392 extracts using glutathione-agarose beads (Pharmacia). The proteins were not eluted, but left on the beads and stored at 4 °C in phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% Triton X-100. To equalize the amounts of proteins used in the kinase assays the concentrations of GST fusion proteins were estimated by Coomassie Blue staining after sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). The beads were washed twice with the respective kinase buffers before usein vitro kinase assays. GST-Pax6-containing agarose beads (5–20 μl) were mixed with either: 1) 2 μl of 10 × MAPK buffer (500 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 100 mmMgCl2, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mmEGTA), 2 μl of 1 mm ATP, 0.5 μl of [γ-32P]ATP (100 μCi/μmol), and 1 unit of recombinant active ERK2 kinase (New England Biolabs) in a total volume of 20 μl, or with 2) 4 μl of 10 × p38 kinase reaction buffer (250 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 100 mm magnesium acetate), 500 μm ATP, 0.5 μl of [γ-32P]ATP (100 μCi/μmol), and 1 μl (1 μg) of recombinant active p38 kinase (Stratagene) in a total volume of 40 μl. The reactions were left at 30 °C for 30 min, flicking the tubes every fifth min. The agarose beads were subsequently washed with 500 μl of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) before boiling in 25 μl of 2 × SDS-PAGE gel loading buffer. The proteins were loaded on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and run at 20 mA for 1.5–2 h in a Tris glycine buffer. The gel was dried, and exposed for autoradiography. Assays with c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) was performed as described previously (52Westwick J.K. Brenner D.A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 255: 342-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Subconfluent NIH3T3 cells were transfected with 10 μg of pCI-GST-Pax6(353–437) or phosphorylation site mutants in 10-cm diameter cell culture dishes using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. Following 4 h of incubation with DNA, the cells were washed 3 times in PBS and left for 8 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplied with 0.1% serum. After 3 washes in Tris-buffered saline, pH 7.5, the cells were left for 30 min in phosphate-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (ICN) containing 0.1% dialyzed newborn calf serum, 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, and 2 mml-gluthamine and labeled for 8 h by adding 1 mCi/ml [32P]orthophosphate (Amersham). Some of the dishes were stimulated by adding dialyzed serum to 10% for 15 min. The culture dishes were placed on ice, washed twice in ice-cold PBS, and the cells were harvested by scraping in 1 ml of RIPA buffer (PBS containing 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS with added protease and phosphatase inhibitors as described previously (53Bjørkøy G. Perander M. Øvervatn A. Johansen T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11557-11565Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar)). Cleared lysates were mixed with 100 μl of 50% slurry of gluthatione-agarose beads (Pharmacia) and incubated at 4 °C for 1 h on a rotating wheel. The beads were then washed 8 times in phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% Triton X-100 and the final pellet was resuspended in 40 μl of 2 × SDS-PAGE gel loading buffer and boiled for 5 min. The labeled phosphoproteins were separated on a 10% polyacrylamide gel, electrotransferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane (Millipore), and visualized directly by autoradiography. Quantitation of the signals was performed using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). Indirect detection of phosphorylation at serine 413 by monitoring a mobility shift was done by Western blotting using polyclonal Pax6 (P6C) or GST antibodies as described below. For [35S]methionine/cysteine labeling of proteins the cells were left for 30 min in methionine/cysteine-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma) containing 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 2 mml-glutamine, and 10% dialyzed newborn calf serum before adding 35S-labeled amino acids (0.1 mCi/ml; Amersham) for 4 h. GST fusion proteins were purified as described above. Following purification the samples were split in two, half of the sample were resuspended in 2 × SDS-PAGE gel loading buffer and the other half was washed twice in λ-phosphatase assay buffer (New England Biolabs) before addition of 1000 units of λ-phosphatase (New England Biolabs) in a total volume of 25 μl. The dephosphorylation was stopped after a 30-min incubation at 30 °C by adding 10 μl of 5 × SDS-PAGE gel loading buffer. The samples were boiled and proteins were separated on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, electrotransferred onto a PVDF membrane, and visualized by autoradiography using Kodak BioMax MR film. For phosphorylation shift analyses using Western blot detection subconfluent cell cultures of NIH3T3 or HeLa cells were transfected with 10 μg of the different expression vectors using LipofectAMINE as described above for NIH3T3 cells or calcium-phosphate coprecipitation for HeLa cells. After 16 h of serum deprivation (0.1% serum) the cells were stimulated with 10% serum or 100 ng/ml phorbol ester (TPA, Sigma) for the indicated times. GST fusion protein purification and SDS-PAGE were performed as described above. Following electrotransfer onto PVDF membranes the proteins were detected using polyclonal anti-GST or anti-Pax6 antibodies (P6C) as described below. For p38 kinase-mediated in vivo phosphorylation, 10 μg of GAL4-Pax6(299–437) TAD fusion constructs (wild-type and mutants) in the pFA-CMV expression vector (Stratagene) were co-transfected with 5 μg of p38 kinase (54Zhang S.

In vivo labeling with [32P]orthophosphate was done essentially as described above with the exception that the cells were harvested in HA lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100) for experiments with p38 kinase and JNK lysis buffer (25 mm Hepes, pH 7.7, 300 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.15 Triton X-100) for experiments with activated MEK1. Both lysis buffers contained the following inhibitors: 20 mm p-nitrophenyl phosphate, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 50 μm sodium vanadate, 5 mm benzamidine, 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 20 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 0.5 mm phenylmethyl sulfonate, 0.7 μg/ml pepstatin A. Polyclonal anti-GAL4 DBD antibodies and protein A/G-Sepharose beads (both from Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were used for immunoprecipitation of the GAL4-Pax6 fusion proteins. The beads were washed 3 times with the lysis buffer before boiling in 30 μl of gel-loading buffer and electrophoresis on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel.

The gene encoding ethanolamine kinase (EKI1) was identified from the SaccharomycesGenome Data Base (locus YDR147W) based on its homology to theSaccharomyces cerevisiae CKI1-encoded choline kinase, which also exhibits ethanolamine kinase activity. The EKI1 gene was isolated and used to construct eki1Δ andeki1Δ cki1Δ mutants. A multicopy plasmid containing the EKI1 gene directed the overexpression of ethanolamine kinase activity in wild-type, eki1Δ mutant,cki1Δ mutant, and eki1Δ cki1Δ double mutant cells. The heterologous expression of the S. cerevisiae EKI1 gene in Sf-9 insect cells resulted in a 165,500-fold overexpression of ethanolamine kinase activity relative to control insect cells. The EKI1 gene product also exhibited choline kinase activity. Biochemical analyses of the enzyme expressed in insect cells, in eki1Δ mutants, and incki1Δ mutants indicated that ethanolamine was the preferred substrate. The eki1Δ mutant did not exhibit a growth phenotype. Biochemical analyses of eki1Δ,cki1Δ, and eki1Δ cki1Δ mutants showed that the EKI1 and CKI1 gene products encoded all of the ethanolamine kinase and choline kinase activities in S. cerevisiae. In vivo labeling experiments showed that the EKI1 and CKI1 gene products had overlapping functions with respect to phospholipid synthesis. Whereas theEKI1 gene product was primarily responsible for phosphatidylethanolamine synthesis via the CDP-ethanolamine pathway, the CKI1 gene product was primarily responsible for phosphatidylcholine synthesis via the CDP-choline pathway.

The major membrane phospholipids in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae are PC, 1The abbreviations used are: PC, phosphatidylcholine; PE, phosphatidylethanolamine; PI, phosphatidylinositol; PS, phosphatidylserine; CDP-DAG, CDP-diacylglycerol; PA, phosphatidate; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; kb, kilobase(s); bp, base pair. 1The abbreviations used are: PC, phosphatidylcholine; PE, phosphatidylethanolamine; PI, phosphatidylinositol; PS, phosphatidylserine; CDP-DAG, CDP-diacylglycerol; PA, phosphatidate; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; kb, kilobase(s); bp, base pair.

In addition to being major structural components of cellular membranes, they play important roles in various cellular processes including signal transduction (1Carman G.M. Zeimetz G.M. J. Biol.

Nearly all of the genes encoding the enzymes responsible for the synthesis of these phospholipids have been isolated and characterized, and many of the enzymes have been purified and studied (1Carman G.M.

Two alternative pathways, the CDP-DAG pathway and the CDP-choline pathway (Fig. 1), synthesize PC, the most abundant membrane phospholipid. Wild-type cells primarily use the CDP-DAG pathway when they are grown in the absence of choline (1Carman G.M. Zeimetz G.M. J. Biol.

The ethanolamine is transported into these cells and used to synthesize PE via the CDP-ethanolamine pathway. PE is subsequently methylated to form PC via the CDP-DAG pathway (Fig. 1).The prevailing view has been that the CDP-choline pathway is a salvage pathway used by cells when the CDP-DAG pathway is compromised (11Carman G.M. Henry S.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 635-669Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, recent studies have shown that the CDP-choline pathway contributes to PC synthesis even when wild-type cells are grown in the absence of exogenous choline (12Patton-Vogt J.L. Griac P. Sreenivas A. Bruno V. Dowd S. Swede M.J. Henry S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20873-20883Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). PC synthesized by the CDP-DAG pathway is constantly metabolized to choline and PA via the action of phospholipase D (13Sreenivas A. Patton-Vogt J.L. Bruno V. Griac P. Henry S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16635-16638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The choline generated is then incorporated back into PC via the CDP-choline pathway and the PA is recycled back into PC, and other phospholipids (e.g. PI), via the CDP-DAG pathway (13Sreenivas A. Patton-Vogt J.L. Bruno V. Griac P. Henry S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16635-16638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). In fact, proper regulation of the CDP-choline pathway is important to overall lipid synthesis. For example, the activation of the CDP-choline pathway, due to the unregulated synthesis of CTP, results in significant increases in the synthesis of PC and PA and a decrease in the synthesis of PS (14Ostrander D.B. O'Brien D.J. Gorman J.A. Carman G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18992-19001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). These changes are accompanied by an increase in total neutral lipid content at the expense of total phospholipids (14Ostrander D.B. O'Brien D.J. Gorman J.A. Carman G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18992-19001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The importance of the CDP-choline pathway to cell physiology is emphasized by the fact that the lethal phenotype ofsec14 mutants defective in the PI/PC transfer protein (Sec14p) is suppressed by mutations in the CDP-choline pathway (15Cleves A.E. McGee T.P. Whitters E.A. Champion K.M. Aitkin J.R. Dowhan W. Goebl M. Bankaitis V.A. Cell. 1991; 64: 789-800Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar,16McGee T.P. Skinner H.B. Whitters E.A. Henry S.A. Bankaitis V.A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 273-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar).The role of the CDP-ethanolamine pathway in phospholipid metabolism and cell physiology has not been studied as extensively as the CDP-choline pathway. Although the genes encoding the enzymes catalyzing the last two steps in the CDP-ethanolamine pathway have been isolated and characterized (17Min-Seok R. Kawamata Y. Nakamura H. Ohta A. Takagi M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1996; 120: 1040-1047Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 18McMaster C.R. Bell R.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1348: 117-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), little is known about the enzyme ethanolamine kinase (ATP:ethanolamine O-phosphotransferase, EC 2.7.1.82) that catalyzes the committed step in this pathway. In this paper we report the isolation and characterization of the EKI1(ethanolamine kinase) gene encoding ethanolamine kinase in S. cerevisiae. Analysis of theEKI1 gene product expressed in Sf-9 insect cells and the analysis of cells with deletions in the EKI1 andCKI1 genes indicated that the EKI1 gene product exhibited both ethanolamine kinase and choline kinase activities. TheEKI1 gene product was primarily responsible for PE synthesis via the CDP-ethanolamine pathway, whereas the CKI1 gene product was primarily responsible for PC synthesis via the CDP-choline pathway. Unlike cki1 mutants, eki1Δ mutants did not suppress the essential function of Sec14p.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterialsAll chemicals were reagent grade. Growth medium supplies were from Difco.

Amplification of the plasmid pKSK1 was performed in E. coli strain Epicurian ColiRXL-1.Isolation of the EKI1 GeneA DNA sequence encoding an open reading frame in the Saccharomyces Genome Data Base (locus YDR147W) (GenBankTM accession number Z50046) was namedEKI1. A 2.9-kb DNA fragment containing 595 bp of the putative EKI1 promoter, its entire protein coding sequence, and 678 bp of the 3′-flanking sequence was obtained by PCR (primers 5′-TTGTTTACCTTTTTCCTAAACAGG-3′ and 5′-TGGTGTTTTTGGTTCATTATACGG-3′) using strain W303-1A genomic DNA as a template. The PCR product was ligated into the SrfI site of the pCRScriptTM AMP SK(+) cloning vector resulting in the creation of pKSK1. This plasmid was digested withPstI/SacI. The resulting 2.9-kb fragment containing the open reading frame and 595 bp of the promoter region and 678 bp of the 3′-flanking region was ligated into thePstI/SacI sites of YEp352 (27Hill J.E. Myers A.M. Koerner T.J. Tzagoloff A. Yeast. 1986; 2: 163-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (1078) Google Scholar) to create plasmid pKSK3. This construct was then transformed into W303-1B and the indicated mutants for the overexpression of the EKI1 gene product.A genomic copy of the EKI1 gene was also isolated. A search of the Saccharomyces Genome Data Base indicated that theEKI1 gene flanked the 3′-end of the KGD2 gene, which was isolated by Repetto and Tzagoloff (28Repetto B. Tzagoloff A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 4221-4232Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). We obtained the 2-μm plasmid pG104/T1 that was used originally by Repetto and Tzagoloff (28Repetto B. Tzagoloff A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 4221-4232Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) for isolation of the KGD2 gene. This plasmid contains an insert of yeast genomic DNA of approximately 8 kb. PCR and restriction enzyme analyses indicated that pG104/T1 contained theEKI1 open reading frame and its 5′- and 3′-flanking sequences. A 4.8-kb insert, containing the EKI1 gene with its promoter and 3′-untranslated region, was released from pG104/T1 by digestion with BamHI/SphI. This fragment was ligated into the BamHI/SphI sites of pUC18 to form plasmid pKSK4. Plasmid pKSK4 was used to construct a recombinant viral expression vector of the EKI1 gene in Sf-9 insect cells.Recombinant Viral Expression of the S. cerevisiae EKI1 Gene in Insect CellsPlasmid pKSK4 was digested withBglII/BstZ17I to release the genomic version of the entire EKI1 gene. This DNA fragment was ligated into theBamHI/HincII sites of the pUC18 vector resulting in the formation of plasmid pKSK6. Plasmid pKSK6 was digested withBstYI/PstI to release the EKI1 open reading frame, which was then ligated into theBamHI/PstI sites of the baculovirus vector pVL1393 to form plasmid pKSK7.Sf-9 cells were maintained and grown as monolayers in TMNFH medium containing containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (medium A) (29O'Reilly D.R. Miller L.K. Luckow V.A. Anonymous Baculovirus Expression Vectors: A Laboratory Manual. W. H. Freeman & Co., New York1992: 109-215Google Scholar). Sf-9 cells were co-transfected with pKSK7 and BaculoGoldTM Autographa californica DNA (PharMingen) using the CaCl2 method. Sf-9 infection procedures followed the methods described by O'Reilly et al. (29O'Reilly D.R. Miller L.K. Luckow V.A. Anonymous Baculovirus Expression Vectors: A Laboratory Manual. W. H. Freeman & Co., New York1992: 109-215Google Scholar). For EKI1 expression, Sf-9 cells (1–2 × 107 cells grown in 75-cm2 tissue culture flasks) were infected at a viral multiplicity of 10 and grown for 48 h in medium A. The infected cells were collected by gentle trituration with medium, harvested by centrifugation, and washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline. The final cell pellet was snap-frozen over dry ice and stored at −80 °C.Construction of eki1Δ and cki1Δ MutantsThe plasmid pKSK1 was digested with BglII/BsaBI to remove the approximately 70% EKI1 coding region. A 1.8-kbTRP1 disruption cassette, derived from plasmid pJA52 (30Allen J.B. Elledge S.J. Yeast. 1994; 10: 1267-1272Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) byBglII/SmaI digestion, was inserted into theBglII/BsaBI sites of plasmid pKSK1 to create the plasmid pKSK2. A linear 4-kb EKI1 disruption cassette was released from the plasmid pKSK2 by digestion withSacI/XhoI. Strain W303-1B was transformed with this DNA fragment to disrupt the chromosomal copy of theEKI1 gene by the one-step gene disruption technique (31Rothstein R.

Disruption of the chromosomal copy of the EKI1 gene was confirmed by PCR (32Trotter P.J. Pedretti J. Voelker D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21416-21424Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using the primers listed above with the extension time increased to 4 min. The template for the PCRs used to confirm the EKI1 disruption was genomic DNA isolated from transformed colonies that grew on medium without tryptophan. One of the eki1Δ mutants that we isolated was designated strain KS101.A similar strategy was used to construct cki1Δ andeki1Δ cki1Δ double mutants. A linear 4-kbCKI1 disruption cassette was released from the plasmid pCTY307 (15Cleves A.E. McGee T.P. Whitters E.A. Champion K.M. Aitkin J.R. Dowhan W. Goebl M. Bankaitis V.A.

Strain W303-1A was transformed with this DNA fragment to disrupt the chromosomal copy of the CKI1 gene (31Rothstein R. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 281-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (1098) Google Scholar). Transformants were selected for their ability to grow on complete synthetic medium without histidine. Similarly, the CKI1 gene was disrupted in theeki1Δ mutant strain KS101, and transformants were selected for their ability to grow without tryptophan and histidine. Disruption of the chromosomal copy of the CKI1 gene in these cells was confirmed by PCR (primers, 5′-TTCGGATTATCTGAAGCAGG-3′ and 5′-GGAAGTCAATGATGTAGACG-3′) with the extension time increased to 2.5 min. The template for the PCRs used to confirm the CKI1disruption was genomic DNA isolated from transformed colonies that grew on medium without histidine and without tryptophan and histidine, respectively. One of the cki1Δ mutants and one of theeki1Δ cki1Δ double mutants that we isolated were designated strains KS105 and KS106, respectively.The EKI1 and CKI1 deletion cassettes were used to transform a temperature-sensitive sec14 mutant (strain CTY5-2D) (31Rothstein R. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 281-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (1098) Google Scholar). The appropriate transformants were isolated, and the disruptions of the chromosomal copies of the EKI1 andCKI1 genes in the sec14 ts background were confirmed by PCR as described above. The eki1Δsec14 ts and cki1Δsec14 ts double mutants were designated KS118 and KS119, respectively.Preparation of Cell ExtractsAll steps were performed at 5 °C. Yeast cells were disrupted with glass beads with a Mini-Bead-Beater (Biospec Products) in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5) containing 1 mm Na2EDTA, 0.3m sucrose, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.5 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 1 mmbenzamide, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 5 μg/ml pepstatin (33Klig L.S.

The reaction mixture contained 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.5), 5 mm ethanolamine, 10 mm ATP, 10 mmMgSO4, and enzyme protein in a final volume of 50 μl. The product phosphoethanolamine was identified by thin layer chromatography on silica gel plates using the solvent system methanol, 0.6% sodium chloride, ammonium hydroxide (10:10:1) (35Elabbadi N. Ancelin M.L. Vial H.J. Biochem. J. 1997; 324: 435-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The position of the labeled phosphoethanolamine on chromatograms was determined by fluorography using EN3HANCE and compared with standard phosphoethanolamine. The amount of labeled product was determined by scintillation counting. All assays were performed in triplicate with an average S.D. of ±5%. All assays were linear with time and protein concentration.Choline kinase activity was measured for 10 min at 30 °C by following the formation of 3H-labeled phosphocholine from [methyl-3H]choline (2,000 cpm/nmol) as described previously (36Porter T.J.

The reaction mixture contained 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.5), 5 mm choline, 10 mm ATP, 10 mm MgSO4, and enzyme protein in a final volume of 50 μl. Radiolabeled phosphocholine was separated from the radiolabeled substrate by the precipitation of the substrate as choline reineckate (36Porter T.J. Kent C.

https://openalex.org/W2054861954,"We used two cell lines expressing fast (RPEfast) and slow (RPEslow) attachment kinetics to investigate mechanisms of cell-substratum adhesion. We show that the abundance of a cytoskeletal protein, vinculin, is dramatically decreased in RPEfast cells. This coincides with the diminished expression level of an endoplasmic reticulum chaperone, calreticulin. Both protein and mRNA levels for calreticulin and vinculin were decreased in RPEfast cells. After RPEfast cells were transfected with cDNA encoding calreticulin, both the expression of endoplasmic reticulum-resident calreticulin and cytoplasmic vinculin increased. The abundance of other adhesion-related proteins was not affected. RPEfast cells underexpressing calreticulin displayed a dramatic increase in the abundance of total cellular phosphotyrosine suggesting that the effects of calreticulin on cell adhesiveness may involve modulation of the activities of protein tyrosine kinases or phosphatases which may affect the stability of focal contacts. The calreticulin and vinculin underexpressing RPEfast cells lacked extensive focal contacts and adhered weakly but attached fast to the substratum. In contrast, the RPEslow cells that expressed calreticulin and vinculin abundantly developed numerous and prominent focal contacts slowly, but adhered strongly. Thus, while the calreticulin overexpressing RPEslow cells “grip” the substratum with focal contacts, calreticulin underexpressing RPEfast cells use close contacts to “stick” to it.

Thus, while the calreticulin overexpressing RPEslow cells “grip” the substratum with focal contacts, calreticulin underexpressing RPEfast cells use close contacts to “stick” to it. Cells can form many different types of adhesion to the substratum, however, the best known are focal contacts and close contacts (1Izzard C.S. Lochner L.R. J. Cell Sci. 1976; 21: 129-159Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Both focal and close contacts have been defined in terms of the closeness of the cell's ventral surface to substratum by interference reflection microscopy (IRM) 1The abbreviations used are: IRM, interference reflection microscopy; ConA, concanavalin A; ECIS, electric cell-substrate impedance sensing; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; FBS, fetal bovine serum; Tyr(P), phosphotyrosine; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; RPE, retinal pigment epithelium; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoreses; TRITC, tetramethyl rhodamine isothiocyanate; FAK, focal adhesion kinase; PIPES, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid.

Focal contacts have been extensively characterized, both at the biochemical and microscopic level (for reviews, see Refs. 3Burridge K. Chrzanowska-Wodnicka M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 463-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (1660) Google Scholar and 4Burridge K. Chrzanowska-Wodnicka M. Zhong C.L. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 342-347Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). When viewed by IRM (1Izzard C.S. Lochner L.R. J. Cell Sci. 1976; 21: 129-159Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Curtis A.S.G. J. Cell Biol. 1964; 20: 199-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar), focal contacts appear as discrete (ca. 10 by 0.5 μm) black patches and represent the areas of closest approach of the ventral cell membrane to the substratum (10–15 nm or less) (1Izzard C.S. Lochner L.R. J. Cell Sci. 1976; 21: 129-159Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Heath J.P. Dunn G.A. J. Cell Sci. 1978; 29: 197-212PubMed Google Scholar). Structurally, focal contacts associate with termini of stress fibers (5Heath J.P. Dunn G.A. J. Cell Sci. 1978; 29: 197-212PubMed Google Scholar) and are the sites of linkage of the actin cytoskeleton to the extracellular matrix via integrins (6Chen W.-T. Hasegawa E. Hasegawa T. Weinstock C. Yamada K.M. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 100: 1103-1114Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Many “focal adhesion proteins” such as focal adhesion kinase (pp125FAK), paxillin, talin, α-actinin, and vinculin have been shown to localize there (3Burridge K. Chrzanowska-Wodnicka M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 463-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (1660) Google Scholar, 4Burridge K. Chrzanowska-Wodnicka M. Zhong C.L.

Winkler J. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1995; 11: 379-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). It is thought that these cytoplasmic proteins have a role in stabilizing the focal contact after its formation and in signal transduction through integrins clustered there (3Burridge K. Chrzanowska-Wodnicka M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 463-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (1660) Google Scholar, 8Hynes R.O. Cell. 1992; 69: 11-25Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9014) Google Scholar). Relatively little is known about close contacts. The ventral cell membrane is separated from the substratum by a distance of 20–50 nm in close contacts and they appear as broad gray areas by IRM (1Izzard C.S. Lochner L.R. J. Cell Sci. 1976; 21: 129-159Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Close contacts do not contain vinculin or talin nor do they associate with the termini of bundled actin microfilaments (9Katoh K. Kano Y. Masuda M. Fujiwara K. Cell Struct. Funct. 1996; 21: 27-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), but instead they may associate with a cortical meshwork of actin microfilaments (10Couchman J.R. Rees D.A. J. Cell Sci. 1979; 39: 149-165PubMed Google Scholar). Their only distinguishing feature suggested so far may be an accumulation of α-actinin (11Chen W.-T. Singer S.J. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 95: 205-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Close contacts are the main form of adhesion to the substratum in cells lacking focal contacts. Finally, non-adherent areas of a cell's underside appear white by IRM and are characterized by a cell-substratum separation distance of 100 nm or more. To investigate the mechanisms of cell adhesiveness, we used retinal pigmented epithelial cell lines displaying fast (RPEfast) or slow (RPEslow) kinetics of attachment to the substratum. Here we show that differential adhesiveness correlates inversely with the expression level of mRNA and protein for the focal contact-associated cytoskeletal protein, vinculin, and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) resident chaperone, calreticulin. Calreticulin is a multifunctional Ca2+-binding protein of the ER shown to be important in Ca2+ homeostasis (12Bastianutto C. Clementi E. Codazzi F. Podini P. De Giorgi F. Rizzuto R. Meldolesi J.

Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 589-600Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The RPEslow cells develop prominent focal contacts which likely account for the high strength of adhesion, whereas the RPEfast have no focal contacts but extensive close contacts and consequently require smaller forces to detach. Furthermore, we show that an inverse relationship exists between the level of calreticulin and the level of total cellular phosphotyrosine (Tyr(P)) such that the cells underexpressing calreticulin display a dramatic increase in the abundance of total cellular Tyr(P). In either cell type spatial distributions of calreticulin and Tyr(P) are complementary, with the former being confined to the ER and the latter being found outside of it. This suggests that the effects of calreticulin on cell adhesiveness may involve modulation of the activities of protein-tyrosine kinases or phosphatases.

The relative abundance of mRNA was determined using a Fujiex BAS1000 PhosphorImager. For immunolocalization, the cells on coverslips were fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde in PBS for 10 min. After washing (3 times for 5 min) in PBS, the cells were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in buffer containing 100 mm PIPES, 1 mm EGTA, and 4% (w/v), polyethylene glycol 8000 (pH 6.9) for 2 min, washed 3 times for 5 min in PBS, and then incubated either anti-calreticulin antibody (diluted 1:50 in PBS), anti-vinculin antibody (diluted 1:50 in PBS), or anti-Tyr(P) (diluted 1:50 in PBS) for 30 min at room temperature. After washing (3 times for 5 min) in PBS the cells were stained with appropriate secondary antibodies for 30 min at room temperature. The secondary antibodies were: fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated donkey anti-mouse IgG(H+L)(diluted 1:30 in PBS), Texas Red-conjugated donkey anti-mouse (F(ab′)2 used at 1:30 dilution), and dichlorotriazinylamino fluorescein-conjugated donkey anti-goat IgG(H+L) (diluted 1:30 in PBS). TRITC-conjugated ConA was used at 20 μg/ml in PBS. For double labeling incubations with appropriate antibodies were done sequentially. After the final wash (3 times 5 min) the slides were mounted in Vinol 205S which contained 0.25% 1,4-diazabicyclo-(2,2,2)-octane and 0.002%p-phenylenediamine to prevent photobleaching. For actin staining, stock solution of 3.3 mm rhodamine phalloidin in methanol was diluted 1:10 in PBS and incubated with fixed and permeabilized cells for 20 min at room temperature. A Bio-Rad MRC-600 confocal fluorescence microscope equipped with a krypton/argon laser was used for fluorescence and phase-contrast microscopy. For IRM, cells were plated on 15-mm square coverslips and allowed to attach for ∼36 h. Cells were fixed with 4% glutaraldehyde for 10 min and washed with PBS and mounted in PBS. IRM was conducted as described previously (1Izzard C.S. Lochner L.R. J. Cell Sci. 1976; 21: 129-159Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,34Opas M. Kalnins V.I. Eur. J.

IRM takes advantage of the interference of wavefronts reflected at the phase boundaries created by the thin layer of culture medium which separates a cell and the glass substratum to which that cell adheres. In monochromatic light, gray levels in the resultant fringe image is indicative of the distance of separation between the cell and the substratum (1Izzard C.S. Lochner L.R. J.

In general, white indicates a separation distance over 100 nm, light-to-dark greys are generated by a separation of 70–20 nm, and black is generated by a cell-substratum gap of less than 15 nm. For further analysis, the brightness of IRM images was normalized using Adobe Photoshop such that all cell-free areas were all displaying a similar gray level range. Next, the images were analyzed in terms of the percentage of area of cell underside of each cell image, which fell under one of four gray level ranges. To do so, the number of pixels falling within a specified gray level range was quantified with Image Pro Plus software. The ranges were designated as follows: “black,” “dark gray,” “light gray,” and “white.” For focal contact counting, the cells were labeled with anti-vinculin antibody as described above and the vinculin positive patches were manually counted. For attachment assays, cells were trypsinized with EDTA-free trypsin, and plated onto tissue culture dishes at an initial density of ca. 40,000 cells per 35-mm dish. Some experiments were conducted on fibronectin-coated culture dishes. Briefly, tissue culture dishes were incubated for 90 min with a fibronectin solution (1 μg/ml in PBS) at 37 °C, then rinsed with cold PBS and used without drying. At selected time intervals, non-adherent cells were washed off the dishes with a brief rinse of cold medium and the remaining adherent cells were trypsinized and counted (in triplicate) on a Coulter Counter (Coulter Electronics, Hialeah, FL). For calcium sensitivity of cell attachment, Ca2+-free medium was prepared in the same manner as high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium except for the omission of CaCl2, replacement of vitamin D-Ca2+pantothenate by Na+-pantothenate, and the use of chelated distilled water. Chelation of water was carried out with Chelex 100 resin at 5 g/10 liter for 1 h with stirring. FBS was chelated with 5 g of Chelex per 100 ml for 1 h with stirring, after which Chelex was filtrated and pH adjusted to 7.2. Ca2+concentration was measured with F-2000 Hitachi fluorescence spectrophotometer using 1.2 mm Indo-1 Na+dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide. Calibration curve of Ca2+concentrations (0.0–39.8 mm) was made using Calcium Calibration Kit 1. The final Ca2+ concentration of total medium (high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus FBS) was calculated to be approximately 20 nm. Cells were plated at a density of 10,000 cells per 35-mm cell culture dish and allowed to grow for over a week until they were well packed. The culture dishes were washed with PBS (3 × 5 min) before fixing with 2% glutaraldehyde and 2% paraformaldehyde for 30 min. After washing with PBS cells were treated with 0.5% osmium tetroxide for 30 min. Cells were rinsed with distilled water after the next set of PBS washes to prepare them for 30 min en bloc secondary fixation with 1% uranyl acetate. Cells were then rinsed and dehydrated with 5-min single washes with 10, 25, and 50% alcohol, and 2 times 5-min washes with 70, 80, 90, and 100% alcohol and then embedded in Epon. 80–90-nm sections were cut with diamond knife on a microtome and placed on nickel grids. Structural staining with saturated uranyl acetate, washing, and lead citrate staining were 15 min each. The sections were then analyzed on a Hitachi-7000 electron microscope. The apparatus, the model equations, and the frequency scan impedance measurements were as previously reported (38Giaever I. Keese C.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Electrode arrays, relay bank, lock-in amplifier, and software for data analysis were obtained from Applied BioPhysics (Troy, New York). Cells were cultured on a small gold electrode, with a much larger gold electrode serving as the counterelectrode. The total measured resistance is composed of the resistance at the electrode-electrolyte interface, plus the resistance of the current pathway in the electrolyte between the ventral surface of the cells and the electrode, plus the resistance of the current pathway in the electrolyte between the cells. Therefore a difference in measured resistance will indicate a difference in under-the-cells resistance and/or a difference in between-the-cells resistance. The measured capacitance as a function of frequency reflects the rate at which charge moves within the electrode-electrolyte boundary layer, and depends on resistance in the current pathways, the capacitance falling off more rapidly with frequency as the total resistance increases. The data are expressed as normalized resistance (measured resistance in the presence of a cell layer divided by measured resistance of the electrode without cells) versus frequency, and normalized capacitance versus frequency. A difference in the frequency at which the peak of the normalized resistance occurs indicates a difference in the under-the-cells resistance, and thus a difference in cell-substratum separation. As distance between the ventral surface of the cells and the electrode decreases, the peak of the normalized resistance will shift toward lower frequencies (38Giaever I. Keese C.R. Proc. Natl. Acad.

To evaluate the forces necessary to detach the RPE cells we modified a centrifugal detachment assay described by Hertl et al. (43Hertl W. Ramsey W.S. Nowlan E.D. In Vitro. 1984; 20: 796-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Briefly, 100,000 cells were plated in 12-mm Costar Transwell Clear tissue culture inserts (Corning Costar, Cambridge, MA) and allowed to attach overnight. The following day individual tissue culture inserts were submerged upside down (such that the cell layer is now upside down) in centrifugation media (high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's + 10% FBS + 10 mm HEPES) contained in a 25 × 29-mm Beckman Ultra-Clear centrifuge tube (Palo Alto, CA) with a No. 3 rubber stopper at the bottom. Care was taken to ensure that no air bubbles were trapped at the cell-centrifugation medium interface. Two tubes at a time, each containing a different cell type, were centrifuged using a SW-28 swing out bucket rotor in a Beckman XL-70 Ultra Centrifuge. Tubes were either spun at 30,000 or 60,000 × g for 15 min at 22 °C. Control tubes were left on the counter (1 ×g) for 15 min at room temperature. After the application of force the tissue culture inserts were removed and replaced in an upright position. The cells remaining attached were then trypsinized and counted using a Coulter counter. Cells in tissue culture inserts were viewed before and after force application by phase-contrast microscopy to examine cell morphology. Data were expressed as the number of cells remaining attached after the application of force, and pooled from four independent experiments. To characterize the adhesive properties of both RPE cell types, we utilized assays to measure different aspects of cell adhesion, including attachment efficacy, closeness of ventral cell membrane to the substratum, and force required for detachment of cells from the substratum. We first examined the attachment kinetics of the cells in normal and low extracellular Ca2+conditions ([Ca2+] ∼20 nm). Initial attachment of the RPEfast cells was unaffected by the low extracellular Ca2+ conditions. Specifically, almost all of the RPEfast cells, both in norm"

Previous evidence indicates that FGF-2 binds specifically and with high affinity to fibrinogen and fibrin, suggesting that their effects on endothelial cells may be coordinated. In this study, we have, therefore, investigated the ability of FGF-2 bound to fibrinogen and fibrin to stimulate proliferation of endothelial cells. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells were cultured in the presence of FGF-2 with or without fibrinogen, and proliferation was assessed by microscopic examination of cultures, incorporation of [3H]thymidine and by cell counting. Cells cultured in the presence of both FGF-2 and fibrinogen proliferated more rapidly than those with FGF-2 alone and exhibited a decreased population doubling time. At concentrations of FGF-2 up to 150 ng/ml, there was greater endothelial cell proliferation in the presence of fibrinogen than in its absence with the most pronounced effect below 1 ng/ml. The maximum effect of fibrinogen was observed at a molar ratio of fibrinogen to FGF-2 of 2:1, corresponding to the maximum molar binding ratio. Endothelial cells proliferated when plated on fibrin or surface-immobilized fibrinogen with FGF-2, indicating that FGF-2 bound to surface-associated fibrin(ogen) retained activity. We conclude that fibrinogen- or fibrin-bound FGF-2 is able to support endothelial cell proliferation and that fibrinogen potentiates the proliferative capacity of FGF-2.

Endothelial cells normally have a low rate of proliferation in the adult with a life span of 100–10,000 days (1Hobson B. Denekamp J. Br. J. Cancer. 1984; 49: 405-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar), but the endothelium retains its capacity for proliferation, which occurs physiologically in the corpus luteum and uterus and also during wound healing. Endothelial cell proliferation, differentiation and migration are also needed for angiogenesis, an important process in many pathologic conditions including tumor growth, diabetic retinopathy, inflammation, and ischemic thrombotic diseases. Polypeptide growth factors play an important regulatory role in angiogenesis, and several stimulatory and inhibitory molecules have been identified (2Folkman J. Shing Y. J. Biol.

Cell. 1993; 4: 973-982Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar), and they can increase expression of vascular endothelial growth factor, another angiogenic peptide (15Tsai J.C. Goldman C.K. Gillespie G.Y. J. Neurosurg. 1995; 82: 864-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Although FGF-1 and FGF-2 lack signal peptides, they are both active in the pericellular environment and bind with high affinity to specific receptor tyrosine kinases (16Dionne C.A. Crumley G.

FGFs are released from vascular cells following injury, and FGF-2 mRNA is up-regulated in atherosclerotic arteries (17Hughes S.E. Hall P.A. Cardiovasc.

Endothelial cells adhere, spread and proliferate on both fibrinogen and fibrin in vitro through binding to integrins αvβ3 and α5β1(19Cheresh D.A. Berliner S.A. Vicente V. Ruggeri Z.M.

Although endothelial cells are physiologically stable, when exposed normally to a high concentration of fibrinogen in vivo, they interact with fibrin uncommonly, and marked phenotypic change results. Specifically, fibrin exposure in vitro results in loss of monolayer organization, cell retraction, and migration (22Barbieri B. Balcony G. Dejana E. Donati M.B. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol.

These responses require the thrombin-induced cleavage of fibrinopeptide B from the fibrinogen Bβ chain, which results in exposure of a reactive site at the new amino terminus of the fibrin β chain (29Ribes J.A. Feng N. Wagner D.D. Francis C.W. J. Clin. Invest. 1989; 84: 435-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). An endothelial cell receptor interacting with a site within the 15–42 region of the β chain has been identified (30Erban J.K. Wagner D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2451-2458Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and recently shown to be VE-cadherin (31Bach T.L. Barsigian C. Chalupowicz D.G. Busler D. Yean C.H. Grant D.S. Martinez J. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 238: 324-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar).We have recently demonstrated specific high-affinity binding of FGF-2 to fibrinogen and fibrin (32Sahni A. Odrljin T. Francis C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7554-7559Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). This suggests a mechanism by which fibrin can localize FGF-2 at sites of inflammation or tissue injury to coordinate endothelial cell responses. Previous studies have shown that FGF-2 specifically binds to extracellular matrix and is released by heparinase and by heparin, and the proliferative activity of FGF-2 is enhanced by binding to heparin (33Bashkin P.

In this study we have investigated the ability of fibrinogen- and fibrin-associated FGF-2 to stimulate proliferation of endothelial cells in vitro. The results indicate that FGF-2 associated with surface-immobilized fibrinogen or fibrin retains its mitogenic activity, and that the endothelial cell proliferative response to FGF-2 is potentiated by fibrinogen.RESULTSFGF-2 is needed to support endothelial cell growth and survival in culture. To determine whether it retains this activity when bound to fibrinogen, cells were cultured in medium containing 1.5–3 nm FGF-2 in the presence or absence of 30 nmfibrinogen. Because our previous studies demonstrated that FGF-2 binds to fibrinogen with an apparent k D of 1.3 nm, the concentration of free FGF-2 under these conditions would be less than 0.01 nm and insufficient to support cell growth. Cells proliferated well in the presence of fibrinogen and FGF-2 and appeared normal microscopically (Fig. 1A). Apoptosis, which is known to be a consequence of growth factor deprivation, did not occur when cells were cultured with fibrinogen and FGF-2 (Fig. 1B) but was observed with fibrinogen but no FGF-2 (Fig. 1C). These initial microscopic observations indicated that the presence of fibrinogen did not block the biologic activity of FGF-2.The effect of fibrinogen on FGF-2-induced proliferation of endothelial cells was further examined by cell counting and determination of population doubling times. Cells were grown in the presence or FGF-2 with or without fibrinogen in the medium. Hirudin was included to inhibit the low levels of thrombin present in fetal bovine serum and prevent conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin. Population doubling times were calculated using endothelial cells between passages 2 and 8, which were cultured using 25 ng/ml FGF-2 in the presence or absence of 10 μg/ml fibrinogen. A population doubling time of 5.6 ± 0.2 days (n = 7) was determined in the absence of fibrinogen, whereas it was shortened to 2.8 ± 0.3 days (n = 7) (p < 0.0001) when fibrinogen was present in the culture medium. Passage 1 was not used because cells in primary culture and first passage retain the capacity for proliferation independently of exogenously added growth factors. Doubling times were prolonged at later passages probably due to the onset of senescence. The maximum cell density achieved at confluence decreased with time in culture (not shown), but was not influenced by presence or absence of fibrinogen. No morphologic differences were observed microscopically between cultures with or without fibrinogen.The effect of fibrinogen on FGF-2-mediated endothelial cell proliferation was also evaluated by [3H]thymidine incorporation (Fig. 2). In the absence of FGF-2, there was no increase in [3H]thymidine uptake between 6 and 48 h, indicating little or no cell proliferation. Also, little incorporation resulted from the addition of 10 μg/ml fibrinogen to the medium in the absence of FGF-2. As expected, FGF-2 alone stimulated proliferation, and 3H-thymidine incorporation was increased over control at all times points. Addition of fibrinogen potentiated proliferation mediated by FGF-2, with the greatest effect evident at 24 h (p < 0.04). There was little additional proliferation at later times, reflecting contact inhibition (not shown). Microscopic examination confirmed slower growth in the absence of fibrinogen, and a longer time was needed to reach confluence.Figure 2Time-dependent endothelial cell proliferation in the presence or absence of FGF-2 and fibrinogen.Endothelial cells were plated on gelatin-coated wells in McCoy's 5A medium supplemented with 20% FBS, 50 μg/ml ECGS, and 100 μg/ml heparin and allowed to adhere for 6 h. The cells were then washed twice with McCoy's medium and incubated in serum-free medium containing 1% Nutridoma, 1 μCi/ml [3H]thymidine with or without FGF-2 and fibrinogen for varying time intervals. Isotope incorporated into DNA was precipitated with trichloroacetic acid, collected by vacuum filtration, and measured by scintillation counting. At each time point, data are shown for cells incubated in the absence of FGF-2 or fibrinogen (gray bars), with 25 ng/ml FGF-2, and no fibrinogen (open bars), with 25 ng/ml FGF-2 and 10 μg/ml fibrinogen (hatched bars) or 10 μg/ml fibrinogen and no FGF-2 (black bars).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Cell proliferation was dependent on FGF-2 concentration in the presence and absence of fibrinogen (Fig. 3), with a maximum 6.4-fold increase in [3H]thymidine incorporation at 25 ng/ml in the absence of fibrinogen. There was, however, greater proliferation at all concentrations of FGF-2 in the presence of fibrinogen than in its absence. The effect of fibrinogen was particularly evident at FGF-2 concentrations below 1 ng/ml (Fig. 3,inset). For example, at 0.1 ng/ml FGF-2, there was 1.2 ± 0.5-fold increase over baseline in the absence of fibrinogen but 2.8 ± 0.5-fold in its presence (p < 0.001). The FGF-2 concentration dependence of endothelial cell proliferation was more complex in the presence of fibrinogen than in its absence. Maximum proliferation in the presence of both fibrinogen and FGF-2 occurred at 25 ng/ml, with a 13.7 ± 2.7-fold increase in comparison with 5.5 ± 0.2-fold in the absence of fibrinogen at the same FGF-2 concentration (p < 0.03). In the presence of fibrinogen, proliferation decreased at FGF-2 concentrations over 25 ng/ml, declining to 8.8 ± 0.6-fold over baseline at 100 ng/ml and 8.1 ± 0.5-fold at 150 ng/ml. At both latter concentrations, however, the [3H]thymidine incorporation remained higher than in the absence of fibrinogen.Figure 3Effect of fibrinogen on the FGF-2 concentration dependence of endothelial cell proliferation.Endothelial cells were plated on gelatin-coated wells in McCoy's 5A medium supplemented with 20% FBS, 50 μg/ml ECGS, and 100 μg/ml heparin and allowed to adhere for 6 h. The medium was then removed, the cells washed twice, and then cells were overlaid with serum-free medium containing 1% Nutridoma, and 25 ng/ml FGF-2 and 1 μCi/ml [3H]thymidine in the presence (solid line) or absence (dotted line) of 10 μg/ml fibrinogen. After 24 h of incubation, nonadherent cells were removed, and the isotope incorporated into DNA was extracted with trichloroacetic acid. Precipitates were collected by vacuum filtration, and incorporated isotope was measured by scintillation counting; cpm per well was determined and normalized to the results obtained in the absence of FGF-2 and fibrinogen.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The capacity to potentiate FGF-2 stimulated cell proliferation was also characterized over a range of fibrinogen concentrations (Fig. 4). An increase in cell proliferation was observed at 0.25 μg/ml (0.75 nm), and there was progressive enhancement of activity to a maximum of 2.9-fold over baseline at 5 μg/ml (15 nm), representing a molar ratio of fibrinogen to FGF-2 of 2:1. At higher concentrations of fibrinogen, no increased effect on cell proliferation was observed.Figure 4Fibrinogen concentration dependence of FGF-2-mediated endothelial cell proliferation. Endothelial cells were plated on gelatin-coated wells in McCoy's 5A medium supplemented with 20% FBS, 50 μg/ml ECGS, and 100 μg/ml heparin and allowed to adhere for 6 h. The medium was then removed. Cells were washed twice, and then serum-free medium was added containing 1% Nutridoma, and 25 ng/ml FGF-2, and 1 μCi/ml [3H]thymidine in the presence of different concentrations of fibrinogen The molar ratios of FGF-2 to fibrinogen varied from 0.1–2.

Precipitates were collected by vacuum filtration, and incorporated isotope was measured by scintillation counting.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Following tissue injury, thrombin converts fibrinogen to fibrin, an insoluble polymer that forms the initial matrix required for cell adhesion and wound healing. To determine whether FGF-2 was active when bound to fibrinogen or fibrin presented as an adhesive substrate, we prepared surfaces coated with either fibrin or fibrinogen with or without added FGF-2. Endothelial cells were cultured on these surfaces and viewed microscopically. Cells grown on surfaces of fibrinogen (Fig. 5A) or fibrin (Fig. 5B) in the absence of FGF-2 were consistently sparse, but incorporation of FGF-2 into the matrix resulted in marked proliferation (Fig. 5, C and D). Gelatin was used as an alternative adhesive substrate, and wells coated with a solution of gelatin to which FGF-2 had been added did not adequately support proliferation (Fig. 5E). In control wells, however, endothelial cells grew well on a coating of gelatin if FGF-2 was included in soluble form in the culture medium (Fig. 5F). As quantitated by [3H]thymidine incorporation, proliferation was minimal on a surface of either fibrinogen or fibrin in the absence of FGF-2 (Fig. 6), but was significantly enhanced with FGF-2 immobilized with either fibrinogen or fibrin (p < 0.04 for both).Figure 5Endothelial cells cultured on fibrinogen or fibrin in the presence or absence of FGF-2 . Culture wells containing coverslips were coated with fibrinogen (A andC) or fibrin (B and D) with no FGF-2 (A and B) or with 25 ng/ml FGF-2 (Cand D). In control experiments, cells were plated on tissue culture wells coated with gelatin and 25 ng/ml FGF-2 (E) or gelatin alone (F). The cells were cultured in McCoy's medium containing no FGF-2 (A–E) or containing 25 ng/ml FGF-2 (F). After 24 h, the cells were fixed, permeabilized in 0.5% Triton X-100, washed with PBS twice, stained with propidium iodide, and the coverslips were viewed with a fluorescence microscope. Bar = 100 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 6Endothelial cell proliferation on fibrinogen or fibrin coated surfaces in the presence or absence of FGF-2 .Endothelial cells were plated in wells coated with fibrinogen (open bars) or fibrin (filled bars) in the absence or presence of 25 ng/ml FGF-2. After 6 h the medium was removed and replaced with serum-free medium containing 1 μCi/ml [3H]thymidine, and the cultures were incubated for an additional 24 h.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Samples of culture medium containing fibrinogen were collected following the 24 h incubation and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The migration pattern of Aα, Bβ, and γ chains was unchanged and showed no fibrinopeptide A or fibrinopeptide B cleavage, indicating that there was no proteolytic degradation or conversion of fibrinogen into fibrin (data not shown). To determine whether other adhesive glycoproteins also stimulated cell proliferation with FGF-2, endothelial cells were also cultured in the presence of vitronectin (10 μg/ml) or fibronectin (10 μg/ml). Neither fibronectin nor vitronectin increased proliferation significantly, indicating the specificity of fibrinogen in enhancing the effect of FGF-2.DISCUSSIONThe findings presented demonstrate that fibrin- or fibrinogen-bound FGF-2 retains biological activity. Cells cultured in medium containing 1.5 nm FGF-2 and 30 nmfibrinogen supported proliferation and did not undergo apoptosis, which is known to occur under conditions of growth factor deprivation (6Araki S. Shimada Y. Kaji K. Hayashi H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 168: 1194-1200Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). At the concentrations of fibrinogen and FGF-2 used in these experiments, the amount of free FGF-2 would be insufficient to support cell growth. FGF-2 associated with surface-immobilized fibrinogen or fibrin was also active as indicated by its ability to support growth (Fig. 5). Cell proliferation was quantitated by [3H]thymidine incorporation, determination of population doubling times, and cell counting. The findings with each of these methods indicated that the proliferative potential of FGF-2 is enhanced in the presence of fibrinogen. The population doubling time was shorter with fibrinogen, the proliferative rate was greater (Fig. 2), and the cells responded to a lower concentration of FGF-2 when presented in combination with fibrinogen (Fig. 3). At all FGF-2 concentrations, fibrinogen increased its proliferative capacity (Fig. 3), and the maximum effect was observed at a molar ratio of fibrinogen to FGF-2 of 2:1 (Fig. 4), corresponding to the maximum molar binding ratio (32Sahni A. Odrljin T. Francis C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7554-7559Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar).Fibrinogen is an adhesive substrate for endothelial cells, but it is unlikely that the enhanced proliferation observed was due to an effect of fibrinogen on adhesive properties. Cells were fully spread before FGF-2 exposure, and no change in cell spreading was observed during incubation with fibrinogen. No significant increase in FGF-2-induced cell proliferation was observed with fibronectin or vitronectin, indicating the fibrinogen effect was specific. Also, enhanced cell proliferation was observed with fibrinogen even in medium containing 20% fetal bovine serum, which is rich in adhesive proteins, confirming the specificity of the enhancement by fibrinogen. Proliferation was evaluated using several methods because of the experimental limitations of each. Cultures were examined microscopically to evaluate morphologic characteristics including spreading and apoptosis in addition to proliferation. [3H]Thymidine incorporation was measured as an overall index of DNA synthesis, recognizing that proliferation may be underestimated with prolonged exposures. Population doubling time was determined as a direct measure of cell proliferation during prolonged exposure to FGF-2 and fibrinogen with multiple cell passages. Each of these methods indicated significant enhancement of FGF-2 proliferative capacity in the presence of fibrinogen.The mechanism by which fibrinogen potentiates FGF-2 activity is not known but may involve receptor clustering or coordination of cell signaling. Because fibrinogen is a dimeric molecule, binding of two or more FGF-2 molecules could increase cell activation through receptor dimerization analogous to that observed with heparin (41Klagsbrun M. Baird A. Cell. 1991; 67: 229-231Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar). Also, binding of a complex of fibrinogen and FGF-2 could result in co-localization of integrin and FGF receptors at the focal adhesion complex, contributing to signal integration (42Plopper G.E. McNamee H.P. Dike L.E. Bojanowski K. Ingber D.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 1349-1365Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). Fibrinogen may protect FGF-2 from inactivation by serum or cell-associated proteases, thereby prolonging and increasing its activity. Such protection from proteolytic degradation has been observed for FGF-2 bound to extracellular matrix (43Gospodarowicz D. Cheng J. J. Cell. Physiol. 1986; 128: 475-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar, 44Saksela O. Moscatelli D. Sommer A. Rifkin D.B. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 743-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar). Additionally, a recent report indicates that FGF-2 can bind to αvβ3 (45Rusnati M. Tanghetti E. Dellera P. Gualandris A. Presta M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 2449-2461Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), an endothelial cell integrin receptor that also binds fibrinogen, suggesting that the adhesive and proliferative activities of FGF-2 and fibrinogen may be coordinated through a single receptor.Endothelial cell responses to injury and angiogenesis are dependent on both growth factor stimulation and interactions with matrix components. The importance of endothelial cell-matrix interactions in angiogenesis is evident from the binding of FGF-2 to extracellular matrix heparan sulfate proteoglycans. Although of lower affinity than the binding to specific tyrosine kinase receptors, the association with heparan sulfates is physiologically important in protecting FGFs from proteolytic degradation (43Gospodarowicz D. Cheng J. J. Cell. Physiol. 1986; 128: 475-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar, 44Saksela O. Moscatelli D. Sommer A. Rifkin D.B. J.

To explore this problem we analyzed the distribution of the various GPI biosynthetic reactions in subcellular fractions prepared from homogenates of mammalian cells. The results indicate the following: (i) the initial reaction of GPI assembly, i.e. the transfer of GlcNAc to PI to form GlcNAc-PI, is uniformly distributed in the ER; (ii) the second step of the pathway, i.e.de-N-acetylation of GlcNAc-PI to yield GlcN-PI, is largely confined to a subcompartment of the ER that appears to be associated with mitochondria; (iii) the mitochondria-associated ER subcompartment is enriched in enzymatic activities involved in the conversion of GlcN-PI to H5 (a singly mannosylated GPI structure containing one phosphoethanolamine side chain; and (iv) the mitochondria-associated ER subcompartment, unlike bulk ER, is capable of the de novosynthesis of H5 from UDP-GlcNAc and PI. The confinement of these GPI biosynthetic reactions to a domain of the ER provides another example of the compositional and functional heterogeneity of the ER. The implications of these findings for GPI assembly are discussed. Glycosylphosphatidylinositols (GPIs) are synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) via the sequential addition of monosaccharides, fatty acid, and phosphoethanolamine(s) to phosphatidylinositol (PI).

Biochem. 1988; 57: 285-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (952) Google Scholar). GPI-anchored proteins have the general structure protein-(ethanolamine-P-6Manα1–2Manα1–6Manα1–4GlcNα1–6myo-inositol-1-P-lipid), where the structure within parentheses represents a minimal GPI moiety, and the carboxyl terminus of the protein is amide-linked to the GPI ethanolamine residue. GPIs can also be found in cells as free glycolipids representing protein anchor precursors or biosynthetic intermediates. Cellular pools of non-protein-linked GPIs vary depending on their structure as well as cell type, and their physiological significance remains to be determined. The structure and biosynthesis of GPIs has been reviewed recently (3Englund P.T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 121-138Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4McConville M.J. Ferguson M.A.J. Biochem.

GPI biosynthesis involves the sequential addition of monosaccharides and phosphoethanolamine (EtN-P) to phosphatidylinositol (PI) yielding the minimal structure EtN-P-Man3GlcN-PI (Fig. 1). The assembly of GPI anchors in mammalian cells is initiated on the cytoplasmic leaflet of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (10Vidugiriene J. Menon A.K. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 987-996Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) by the formation of GlcNAc-PI from UDP-GlcNAc and PI (11Doering T.L. Masterson W.J. Englund P.T. Hart G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 11168-11173Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). GlcNAc-PI is then de-N-acetylated (to yield GlcN-PI) (11Doering T.L. Masterson W.J. Englund P.T. Hart G.W. J. Biol.

Kodukula K. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 563-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). Many aspects of the GPI biosynthetic pathway can be reproduced in cell-free systems using cell lysates or subcellular membrane fractions supplemented with appropriate soluble metabolites (e.g.UDP-GlcNAc and GDP-mannose). Initial work with membrane fractions prepared from African trypanosomes showed that it was possible to achieve the synthesis of a range of GPI structures from GlcNAc-PI to the phosphoethanolamine-containing protein anchor precursors (23Masterson W.J. Doering T.L. Hart G.W. Englund P.T. Cell. 1989; 56: 793-800Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar,24Menon A.K. Schwarz R.T. Mayor S. Cross G.A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9033-9042Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). While attempting to establish a comparable cell-free system for the assembly of mammalian GPI structures, we found that the biosynthesis of mature GPI species was significantly impaired when purified ER preparations were substituted for unfractionated or coarsely fractionated cell lysates as the enzyme source (8Menon A.K. Baumann N.A. van't Hof W. Vidugiriene J. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1997; 25: 861-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 25Hirose S. Ravi L. Prince G.M. Rosenfeld M.G. Silber R. Andresen S.W. Hazra S.V. Medof M.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6025-6029Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Since the ER was previously identified as the site of initiation of GPI biosynthesis (10Vidugiriene J. Menon A.K. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 987-996Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), these preliminary data suggested that factors required for one or several post-initiation reactions might have been lost from the ER preparation during the fractionation procedure. Alternatively, cell homogenization may have resulted in fragmentation of the ER resulting in the separation of biosynthetically active ER subfractions from “bulk” ER; these subfractions may sediment differently from conventionally isolated ER during the fractionation procedure, resulting in an apparent loss of activity. Growing evidence of the lateral compositional heterogeneity of the ER (10Vidugiriene J. Menon A.K. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 987-996Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) and the recent isolation of functionally specialized subregions of the ER (27Vance J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7248-7256Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,28Wassler M. Fries E. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 285-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) lend credence to the latter possibility. In order to explore these issues we undertook an analysis of the distribution of the various GPI biosynthetic reactions in subcellular fractions prepared from homogenates of mammalian cells. The results, described in this paper, indicate that post-initiation GPI biosynthetic reactions are most active in a subcompartment of the ER. This “GPI-active” subcompartment of the ER co-fractionates with mitochondria and probably corresponds to a previously described ER fraction shown to be active in phospholipid synthesis (27Vance J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7248-7256Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and possibly also involved in phospholipid trafficking between the ER and mitochondria (29Shiao Y.-J. Lupo G.

The Thy-1+ mouse thymoma cell line BW5147.3 was maintained in suspension culture in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37 °C. The CHO-K1 cell lines G9PLAP (stably expressing human placental alkaline phosphatase (PLAP)) and its derivative G9PLAP.85 (a mutant defective in the second step of GPI anchor assembly) were provided by Dr. Victoria Stevens (Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA) and described previously (30Stevens V.L. Zhang H. Harreman M. Biochem. J. 1996; 313: 253-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). CHO-K1 cells were cultured in 5-dm dishes in Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Subcellular fractions were prepared from CHO cells or thymoma cells (see Fig. 2 for an outline of the fractionation procedure). For typical fractionation experiments, CHO-K1 G9PLAP or G9PLAP.85 cells were scraped from 30 dishes into 5 ml/dish of phosphate-buffered saline. BW5147.3 thymoma cells (1 × 109) were collected by centrifugation (1,000 × g for 5 min). The cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and resuspended in 10 ml of buffer A (0.25 m sucrose, 10 mm Hepes/NaOH, pH 7.5, 1 mm DTT) supplemented with protease inhibitor mixture. Cells were transferred to a 15-ml nitrogen cavitation bomb (Kontes Glass Co., Vineland, NJ) and held at 400 pounds/square inch for 30 min. The cavitated cells were treated with S. aureus nuclease (30 units/ml) in the presence of 1 mm CaCl2 for 20 min on ice. The treatment was stopped by adding 1 mm EGTA. Cells were further disrupted by three passages through a 21-gauge needle. The lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 1,000 ×g for 10 min at 4 °C to remove large debris and nuclei. The resulting supernatant was centrifuged at 10,000 ×g for 10 min at 4 °C. The pellet (P10) was washed twice with buffer A and was resuspended in buffer A for enzyme activities measurement or in isolation buffer (250 mm mannitol, 25 mm Hepes/NaOH, pH 7.5, 0.5 mm EGTA) for further purification at a protein concentration of 10–15 mg/ml. The supernatant from the 10,000 × g spin (S10) was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h (Ti 50.2 rotor (Beckman Instruments Inc., Fullerton, CA)). The crude microsome pellet (P100) so obtained was resuspended in 2 ml of buffer A at a concentration of 5–10 mg/ml protein. In some experiments the supernatant was layered on top of a discontinuous sucrose gradient (2 ml of 30% and 4 ml of 38% sucrose prepared in 10 mmHepes/NaOH, pH 7.5) and fractionated by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 2 h. The pellet and 38% sucrose step including the interface were combined, diluted at least 3-fold with buffer A, and collected by centrifugation at 100,000 ×g for 2 h. The resulting pellet, containing relatively pure endoplasmic reticulum membranes (10Vidugiriene J. Menon A.K. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 987-996Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), was resuspended in buffer A. Subcellular fractions were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −70 °C. MAM and mitochondrial fractions were isolated following procedures described for rat liver (27Vance J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7248-7256Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Ardail D. Gasnier F. Lerme F. Simonot C. Louisot P. Gateau-Roesch O. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25985-25992Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and CHO cells (29Shiao Y.-J. Lupo G. Vance J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11190-11198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Briefly, the P10 pellet (obtained as described above) was resuspended in 2 ml of isolation buffer at ∼10–15 mg/ml and layered on top of a 20-ml solution of 30% (v/v) Percoll (prepared in 225 mm mannitol, 25 mmHepes/NaOH, pH 7.5, 1 mm EGTA) in a centrifuge tube. Following 30 min centrifugation at 95,000 × g a light upper band (running approximately half-way down the tube) corresponding to mitochondria-associated membranes (MAM) and a denser lower band corresponding to mitochondria were recovered. The two fractions were collected separately and diluted at least 2-fold with isolation buffer. The mitochondrial fraction was subjected to sonication with a 3-mm probe at 60-V output (sonicator model W185F, Heat Systems-Ultrasonics Inc., Plainview, NY) for 10 s on ice. Both fractions (MAM and mitochondria) were then centrifuged (10,000 × g, 15 min) yielding pellets (MAMp and M, respectively) and supernatants. The pellets were washed 3 times by repeated centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 15 min to remove Percoll and then suspended in buffer A. Since the supernatants from both fractions showed similar marker enzyme activities, they were combined and collected by centrifugation at 100,000 ×g for 1 h. The resulting pellet (MAMs) was washed twice at 75,000 rpm for 30 min in a Beckman TLA 100.3 rotor and resuspended in 2 ml of buffer A. The protein content of each fraction was measured with the Micro BCA Protein Assay Reagent (Pierce). Subcellular fractions were characterized by measuring organelle-specific marker enzyme activities or by determining the amount of marker proteins via Western blot analysis. The following marker enzyme activities were assayed using previously described procedures. NADPH-cytochrome c reductase activity (ER marker) was assayed as described previously (29Shiao Y.-J. Lupo G. Vance J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11190-11198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar) using 10–30 μg of protein for P100 fraction and 30–100 μg of protein for the other fractions. The determination of succinate dehydrogenase (mitochondrial marker) activity was carried out as previously reported (32Graham J.M. Graham J.M. Higgins J.A. Methods in Molecular Biology: Biomembrane Protocols. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ1993: 1-18Google Scholar). The ER proteins ribophorin I, protein disulfide isomerase, and BiP (heavy chain binding protein (GRP78)), and the mitochondrial proteins Hsp60 and Hsp70 were quantitated using standard Western blotting procedures. After probing with primary antibodies (chicken anti-protein disulfide isomerase or rabbit anti-BiP, anti-Hsp60, and anti-Hsp70), blots were developed using peroxidase-conjugated second antibodies and the ECL Western blotting detection system following the protocol provided by the manufacturer. Band intensities were determined by densitometry (at least two different amounts of protein (typically 1 and 2.5 μg) were analyzed and several different film exposures were obtained to verify linearity of the film response for densitometric analysis). As shown in Table I and Fig. 2, mitochondrial markers (Hsp60 and succinate dehydrogenase) were recovered mainly in the P10 fraction. However, the ER markers NADPH cytochrome c reductase, ribophorin I, BiP, and protein disulfide isomerase were present in both the P10 and P100 fractions (Table I; data for protein disulfide isomerase are not shown), indicating that the P10 fraction contains a substantial amount of ER. Ribophorin I, BiP, and protein disulfide isomerase were only slightly (1.1–1.5-fold) enriched in P100 versus P10, whereas NADPH cytochrome c reductase activity (specific activity as well as total) was about 4 times higher in the P100 fraction than in the P10 fraction. A similar trend was also seen in ER fractions obtained from the P10 and P100 (see below). The results point to compositional heterogeneities within the ER, consistent with a variety of other reports (Ref. 10Vidugiriene J. Menon A.K. J.

Open table in a new tab The table presents the protein content and specific marker enzyme activities (mean ± S.E.) of subcellular fractions from thymoma cells. Fractions were prepared from 109 thymoma cells as described under “Experimental Procedures” and outlined in Fig. 2. Ribophorin, BiP, and NADPH:cytochrome c reductase are ER markers. Hsp60 and succinate dehydrogenase are mitochondrial markers. Ribophorin, BiP, and Hsp60 were quantitated by Western blotting and densitometry, and the data are presented in arbitrary units. The units of NADPH:cytochrome c reductase activity and succinate dehydrogenase activity are nmol of cytochrome c reduced per min and nanomoles of p-nitrotetrazolium violet reduced per min/mg of protein, respectively. Total activities are presented in parentheses. Approximately 45% of the total ER marker activities measured in the P10 fraction were recovered in MAMs (Table I). The MAMp and Mito fractions contained ∼20 and ∼7%, respectively (figures represent averages of the data obtained with the markers listed in Table I), of the total ER marker activities measured in the P10 fraction. Taking into account that recovery of the ER markers was ∼70% after the fractionation procedure, this result indicates that the majority of the ER membranes present in P10 are recovered in the MAM fractions (MAMs + MAMp), specifically MAMs. The mitochondrial content of each of the three fractions was determined by measuring levels of succinate dehydrogenase, Hsp60, and Hsp70. Succinate dehydrogenase was recovered mainly in the MAMp and Mito fractions (∼30 and ∼36% of the P10 total level, respectively), although a significant amount (∼22% of the total P10 amount) was also recovered in MAMs. Broadly similar results were obtained with the Hsp70 and Hsp60 markers. The recovery of these proteins in Mito and MAMp was 39 and 20% of the amount in P10, respectively, with only 13% being recovered in MAMs. It is possible that the slightly higher recoveries of succinate dehydrogenase compared with Hsp60/Hsp70 in all 3 fractions are due to the fact that succinate dehydrogenase is a mitochondrial membrane protein, whereas the Hsps are soluble mitochondrial matrix proteins that would most likely be lost from damaged mitochondria. Procedures for in vitro biosynthesis of GlcNAc-PI and GlcN-PI and product verification were essentially as described previously (10Vidugiriene J. Menon A.K. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 987-996Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 33Field M.C. Menon A.K. Hooper N.M. Turner A.J. Lipid Modifications of Proteins: A Practical Approach.

Briefly, isolated fractions (typically 50 μg of protein) were incubated with UDP-[3H]GlcNAc (1 μCi) in buffer A in the presence of 5 mm EDTA, in a total volume of 50 μl at 37 °C. In some experiments 1 μg/ml PI (dissolved in 0.1% Nonidet P-40 (the final concentration of Nonidet P-40 in the reaction mixture was 0.01%)) was also added. The addition of exogenous PI equally stimulated the formation of GlcNAc-PI (about 1.5–2-fold) in all examined fractions, but no difference in the ratios of products was observed. Incorporation of [3H]GlcNAc into products increased linearly for up to 30 min. The reaction was stopped by placing samples on ice, and a single phase lipid extract was obtained by adding 150 μl of water and 1.5 ml of ice-cold chloroform/methanol (1:2, v/v). A two-phase mixture was induced by adding 0.5 ml of chloroform and 0.5 ml of water. The lipid containing chloroform-rich lower phase was washed several times with 0.5 ml of mock upper phase, dried, and dissolved in water-saturated n-butyl alcohol. The products were analyzed by thin layer chromatography (silica gel 60 thin layer plates, using chloroform/methanol, 1 m ammonium hydroxide 10:10:3, v/v/v, as the solvent) and detected with a TLC radioscanner (Berthold Analytical Instruments, Inc., Nashua, NH). Incorporation of radioactivity into the individual species was determined using the integration software supplied with the scanner. Each subcellular fraction to be assayed was adjusted to contain 150 μg of protein suspended in 250 mm sucrose, 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 10 mm EDTA in a reaction volume of 100 μl. All measurements were carried out in duplicate. The de-N-acetylation reaction was started by the addition of 5 μl of a 0.1% Nonidet P-40 solution of GlcN[14C]Ac-PI(diC16) (containing 2500 cpm, ∼80 pmol), and samples were incubated at 37 °C for 4 h. The reactions were terminated by removing 100 μl of the incubation mixture at the appropriate time points and adding it to 50 μl of 100% propan-1-ol, vortexing, and snap-freezing. The samples were thawed, diluted with 100 μl of 1 m ammonium acetate and 750 μl of water (resulting in approximately 1 ml of 5% propan-1-ol, 100 mmammonium acetate per reaction), and passed through a pre-equilibrated 100-mg C8 Sep-Pak cartridge (Waters Corp., Milford, MA). The cartridge was then washed with a further 1 ml of 5% propan-1-ol, 100 mm ammonium acetate. The combined washes (∼2 ml, containing released [14C]acetate) were taken for liquid scintillation counting. Control incubations carried out with boiled membrane preparations were processed identically and used as assay background. Release of [14C]acetate was confirmed by strong anion exchange high pressure liquid chromatography analyses using a 5–500 mm ammonium acetate gradient: the released radioactivity co-chromatographed with a [3H]acetate standard while other possible GlcN[14C]Ac-PI cleavage products (e.g. GlcNAc, GlcNAc-inositol, GlcNAc-inositol-P, GlcNAc-inositol-P-glycerol) eluted in the void volume or bound so strongly to the column that they could only be eluted with a follow-up potassium phosphate g"

The role of CHK in the nervous system is as yet unknown. Using PC12 cells as a model system of neuronal cells, we show that CHK participates in signaling mediated by TrkA receptors. CHK was found to be associated with tyrosine-phosphorylated TrkA receptors in PC12 cells upon stimulation with NGF. Binding assays and far Western blotting analysis, using glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins containing the Src homology 2 (SH2) and SH3 domains of CHK, demonstrate that the SH2 domain of CHK binds directly to the tyrosine-phosphorylated TrkA receptors. Site-directed mutagenesis of TrkA cDNA, as well as phosphopeptide inhibition of the in vitro interaction of the CHK-SH2 domain or native CHK with TrkA receptors, indicated that the residue Tyr-785 on TrkA is required for its binding to the CHK-SH2 domain upon NGF stimulation. In addition, overexpression of CHK resulted in enhanced activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway upon NGF stimulation, and microinjection of anti-CHK antibodies, but not anti-Csk antibodies, inhibited neurite outgrowth of PC12 cells in response to NGF. Thus, CHK is a novel signaling molecule that participates in TrkA signaling, associates directly with TrkA receptors upon NGF stimulation, and is involved in neurite outgrowth of PC12 cells in response to NGF.

In addition, NGF promotes neuronal differentiation of the rat pheochromocytoma cell line, PC12, which has been used extensively to investigate ligand-receptor interactions and cellular differentiation in response to NGF (3Greene L.A.

NGF exerts its growth- and survival-promoting effects on neurons through activation of TrkA and subsequent biochemical events that ultimately influence the expression of various genes, including those encoding ion channels, neurotransmitter-synthesizing enzymes, and cytoskeletal components (10Halegoua S. Armstrong R.C. Kremer N.E. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1991; 165: 119-170PubMed Google Scholar). The binding of NGF to the p140 TrkA receptor induces dimerization of TrkA receptors and stimulates rapid tyrosine autophosphorylation of the receptor (11Kaplan D.R. Martin-Zanca D. Parada L.F. Nature. 1991; 350: 158-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (840) Google Scholar). The phosphotyrosines on activated TrkA serve as docking sites for signaling substrates such as phospholipase C-γ1 (PLC-γ1), phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI-3 kinase), and the Shc adaptor protein (6Chao M.V.

These molecules trigger kinase cascades resulting in the phosphorylation and activation of transcription factors that direct gene expression. Shc triggers the activation of Ras and the subsequent sequential phosphorylation and activation of the kinases Raf, mitogen- and extracellular-regulated kinase, and ERK (13Kaplan D. Stephens R. J.

Csk is ubiquitously expressed, whereas expression of CHK is restricted to hematopoietic cells and the nervous system. The expression of CHK in brain increases postnatally, whereas the expression of Csk decreases with age (27Brinkley P.M. Class K. Bolen J.B. Penhallow R.C.

Because CHK is abundantly expressed in the nervous system, we sought to identify the signaling pathways that involve CHK and to characterize its function in neuronal cells. In this report, we identified and characterized the association of CHK in TrkA signaling and investigated CHK involvement in neuronal differentiation of PC12 cells. Anti-GST monoclonal antibodies were produced as described previously (32Alonso G. Koegl M. Mazurenko N. Courtneidge S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9840-9848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Affinity-purified polyclonal anti-TrkA antibodies against the COOH-terminal peptide of the TrkA receptor were purchased from Oncogene Science (Cambridge, MA). Anti-CHK, anti-Csk, anti-p85/PI-3 kinase, anti-ERK1, and anti-ERK2 antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine (PY-20) was obtained from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). The PhosphoPlus MAP kinase antibody kit was obtained from New England BioLabs (Beverly, MA). Mouse 7S NGF was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY). Glutathione-Sepharose 4B was purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Reagents for electrophoresis were obtained from Bio-Rad. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse Ig antibodies, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit Ig antibodies, and enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) reagents were purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. PC12 cells were grown as described (3Greene L.A. Tischler A.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 2424-2428Crossref PubMed Scopus (4862) Google Scholar). PC12-TrkA cells were stably transfected with TrkA cDNA (33Dikic I. Batzer A.G. Blaikie P. Obermeier A. Ullrich A. Schlessinger J. Margolis B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15125-15129Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). These cells expressed 1.3 × 105 TrkA receptors/cell. Both PC12 and PC12-TrkA cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% heat-inactivated horse serum and 5% fetal bovine serum. The cells were grown on 10-cm dishes coated with poly-l-lysine. For stimulation, cells were stimulated with 100 ng/ml NGF for the indicated periods at 37 °C. To establish PC12 cells that stably overexpress CHK (PC12-CHK), the full-length CHK cDNA (1.6 kilobases) was subcloned into the pcDNA3 vector (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA). Transfection of the CHK cDNA into PC12 cells was performed using LipofectAMINE. The transfected cells were selected in 750 μg/ml Geneticin. Positive transfectants were chosen based on the expression of CHK protein upon immunoblotting with anti-CHK antibodies. PC12-CHK cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% horse serum and 5% fetal bovine serum. Prior to stimulation, cells were starved for 36 h in RPMI 1640 medium containing 0.1% horse serum and 0.1% fetal bovine serum. Cells were then stimulated with 100 ng/ml NGF for the indicated periods at 37 °C, washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and lysed in lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 10% glycerol, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 25 mm NaF, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin). Lysate protein contents were normalized using the Bio-Rad protein assay. Lysates were immunoprecipitated with affinity-purified anti-TrkA, anti-Csk, anti-CHK polyclonal antibodies, anti-p85/PI-3 kinase, and anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies. Immunoprecipitates were diluted with 2× SDS sample buffer 1:2 (v/v) containing β-mercaptoethanol and were separated by 7% SDS-PAGE. In some cases, as indicated in the text, immunoprecipitates were diluted in sample buffer without β-mercaptoethanol. Samples were separated by 7% SDS-PAGE, and then proteins were transferred onto PVDF-Plus membranes (Micron Separations Inc., Westboro, MA). Bound proteins were immunoblotted with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (PY-20), affinity-purified polyclonal anti-TrkA, anti-CHK, or anti-Csk antibodies. The blots were developed using the ECL system. GST fusion proteins containing the CHK-SH3 domain, the CHK-NH2-terminal domain plus SH3 domain (NH2-SH3), the CHK-SH2 plus SH3 domains (CHK-SH2-SH3) or GST alone were prepared as described previously (30Zrihan-Licht S. Deng B. Yarden Y. McShan G. Keydar I. Avraham H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4065-4072Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The starved PC12-TrkA cells were stimulated with 100 ng/ml NGF and then lysed and precipitated with various GST fusion proteins. 10 μg of GST fusion protein bound to glutathione-Sepharose 4B were used for each binding assay. After lysate protein content was normalized and precipitated with GST fusion proteins, bound proteins were immunoblotted with PY-20, affinity-purified polyclonal anti-TrkA antibody, or anti-GST antibody. The blots were developed using the ECL system. For far Western analysis, starved PC12-TrkA cells were stimulated with 100 ng/ml NGF for the indicated periods, lysed, and immunoprecipitated with anti-TrkA antibody. The immunoprecipitates were then separated on 7% SDS-PAGE gels, transferred onto membranes, and subjected to far Western blotting. Ten μg of GST fusion proteins were used for each binding assay. Site-directed mutagenesis of full-length TrkA cDNA in the pUC19 vector was performed using a Transformer site-directed mutagenesis kit (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. In order to change selected tyrosines (Tyr) to phenylalanine (Phe), we used the following synthetic oligonucleotides: 5′-CAC ATC ATC GAG AAC CCA CAA TTC TTC AGT GAT GCC TGT GTT CAC-3′ (Y490F), 5′-TGC CCA CCA GAG GTC TTC GCC ATC ATG CGG GGC-3′ (Y751F), and 5′-CAG GCA CCT CCT GTC TTC CTG GAT GTC CTG GGC-3′ (Y785F). The mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. The mutant and wild-type TrkA inserts were excised from pUC19 vectors and subcloned into the pcDNA3 vector. Transfection into COS-7 cells was performed using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Tyrosine-phosphorylated synthetic peptides were obtained from the Molecular Biology Core Facility at Dana Farber Cancer Institute. Peptides were analyzed for purity by high pressure liquid chromatography, mass spectroscopy, and amino acid analysis. Two phosphotyrosine peptides corresponding to autophosphorylation sites of TrkA, including the Shc association site and the PLC-γ1 association site, were synthesized. In addition, nonphosphorylated peptide corresponding to the PLC-γ1 association site was also synthesized. Unstimulated and NGF-stimulated PC12-TrkA cell lysates were added to the GST-CHK-SH2 fusion protein (10 μg/incubation), which was preincubated with each phosphopeptide. The final concentration of phosphopeptides was 100 μm for each incubation. Lysates were incubated for 1 h at 4 °C and then precipitated by the addition of glutathione-Sepharose 4B for 30 min at 4 °C. Precipitates were washed and separated by 7% SDS-PAGE. MAP kinase assay was performed as described (34Chen R.-H. Sarnecki C. Blenis J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 915-927Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, starved PC12 and PC12-CHK cells (three independent clones that overexpress CHK) were stimulated with NGF (100 ng/ml). Cells were then lysed and immunoprecipitated with anti-ERK1 and anti-ERK2 antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). MAP kinase activity was assayed with myelin basic protein as a substrate in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP. All reactions were allowed to proceed for 10 min at 30 °C. The p44/42 MAP kinase activity was also measured in total lysates using the p44/42 MAP kinase assay kit (New England BioLabs). Phospho-p44/42 MAP kinase monoclonal antibody was used to immunoprecipitate the active p44/42 MAP kinase from the cell extracts, and then an in vitro kinase assay was performed using Elk-1 protein as a substrate. Synchronized PC12 cells were microinjected with purified CHK-specific antibodies (at a concentration of 100 μg/ml) in microinjection buffer with GFP vector plasmid (pEGFP-C2) (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) as a marker in a final concentration of 100 μg/ml. IgGs were purified from control antiserum, Csk and CHK antisera using protein G columns (Mab Trap, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Pooled fractions containing electrophoretically pure IgGs were dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline and concentrated using Centricon concentrators (Amicon Corp., Danvers, MA). Following microinjection, cells were incubated for 2 h at 37 °C. Cells were refed with medium alone or medium containing 0.1% horse serum overnight. The medium was then changed to RPMI medium containing 10% horse serum and 5% fetal bovine serum, with or without NGF (100 ng/ml) as indicated. Cells were monitored and analyzed after 24, 36, and 48 h. Differentiated cells were defined as cells with refractile cell bodies extending at least two processes, one of which had to be longer than the diameter of the cell body. Subsequent phase-contrast micrographs were recorded on Technical Pan film (2415) (Eastman Kodak Co.). Because CHK is a second member of the Csk family and both kinases are expressed in brain, we investigated whether CHK and/or Csk might be involved in one of the main signaling pathways in neuronal cells that is mediated by the neurotrophin NGF. To identify proteins that associate with CHK and Csk in PC12 cells, we analyzed anti-CHK immunoprecipitates from untreated or NGF-stimulated cells. The PC12 cells were starved for 36 h and stimulated with 100 ng/ml NGF for 10 min. Cells were then lysed and immunoprecipitated with either anti-CHK antibodies, affinity-purified anti-TrkA antibodies, anti-Csk antibodies, or control antibodies. Upon NGF stimulation, anti-CHK antibodies, but not anti-Csk or control antibodies, co-immunoprecipitated the tyrosine-phosphorylated protein, p140, corresponding to the activated TrkA receptor (Fig. 1, A and B), whereas anti-TrkA antibodies co-immunoprecipitated CHK protein (Fig. 1C) but not Csk (Fig. 1D). Therefore, these results suggest that CHK, but not Csk, is associated with activated TrkA receptors upon NGF stimulation. In order to determine which domain of CHK interacts with the activated TrkA receptors, we used GST fusion proteins containing the SH2 domain of CHK (CHK-SH2). Serum-starved PC12 cells were stimulated with 100 ng/ml NGF for the indicated periods, lysed, and then precipitated with the GST fusion protein containing the CHK-SH2 domain. The CHK-SH2 domain precipitated tyrosine-phosphorylated TrkA (Fig. 2A) upon stimulation with NGF. The phosphorylation of TrkA upon NGF stimulation was rapid and became prominent at 5 min. The association of CHK with TrkA receptors was also observed after 3 days of NGF stimulation, indicating that this association is a long-term one, based upon the length of the stimulation (Fig. 2B). Similar results of the association of CHK with activated TrkA receptors were obtained using PC12-TrkA cells (PC12 cells stably transfected with TrkA receptors) (data not shown). The potential involvement of other domains of CHK in the interaction with TrkA was examined using GST fusion proteins containing the CHK-SH3 domain, the CHK-SH3-SH2 domain, or GST protein alone. NGF-stimulated PC12 cell lysates were incubated with the different GST fusion proteins, analyzed by 7% SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotted with PY-20 or anti-TrkA antibodies. Anti-phosphotyrosine and anti-TrkA Western blotting revealed that the CHK-SH3-SH2 domain precipitated activated TrkA receptors upon NGF stimulation (Fig. 3). However, the CHK-SH3-GST or GST alone or a nonrelevant SH2 domain did not precipitate any proteins from the same lysates. These results indicate that the CHK-SH2 domain specifically precipitated activated TrkA receptors upon NGF stimulation. In order to determine whether the binding between activated TrkA receptors and the CHK-SH2 domain is direct or indirect, we performed far Western blotting analysis. The phosphorylation of TrkA upon NGF stimulation was rapid, and reached maximum levels after 20 min (Fig. 4, A and B). In the absence of NGF, the SH2 domain of CHK did not bind to TrkA, as observed by far Western blotting (Fig. 4D). However, upon NGF stimulation, binding of the CHK-SH2 domain to TrkA was observed at 2 min. This association was maintained up to 60 min after stimulation with NGF (Fig. 4D). In contrast, the CHK-SH3 domain or GST fusion protein alone did not bind to activated TrkA (Fig. 4,C and E). These results indicate that the CHK-SH2 domain directly interacts with activated TrkA receptors upon NGF stimulation. In order to determine the binding site of the CHK-SH2 domain to TrkA receptors, COS-7 cells were transfected with plasmids encoding wild-type TrkA or with mutated TrkA having tyrosine-phenylalanine mutations at the Shc association site Tyr-490 (Y490F), the p85/PI-3 kinase interaction site Tyr-751 (Y751F), the PLC-γ1 interaction site Tyr-785 (Y785F), or mutations at both Tyr-490 and Tyr-751 (Y490F/Y751F), Tyr-490 and Tyr-785 (Y490F/Y785F), or Tyr-751 and Tyr-785 (Y751F/Y785F). The transfected COS-7 cells were starved and then stimulated with 100 ng/ml NGF for 10 min. Unstimulated and NGF-stimulated cell lysates were divided into two aliquots, and either precipitated with the GST fusion protein containing the CHK-SH2 domain or immunoprecipitated with anti-TrkA antibodies. Tyrosine phosphorylation of wild-type TrkA upon stimulation with NGF was observed in transfected cells. Furthermore, although the CHK-SH2 domain did not precipitate the unstimulated wild-type TrkA receptor, it did precipitate the tyrosine-phosphorylated wild-type TrkA receptor upon NGF stimulation (Fig. 5A). These results demonstrate that the CHK-SH2 domain interacts with activated TrkA receptors upon NGF stimulation in TrkA-transfected COS-7 cells. Experiments in COS-7 cells transfected with TrkA wild-type or mutant constructs revealed that the CHK-SH2 domain precipitated TrkA Y490F and Y751F in the same manner as the wild-type TrkA receptor (Fig. 5B). The same results were observed in the binding of the CHK-SH2 domain to TrkA Y490F/Y751F. However, the CHK-SH2 domain could not precipitate mutant TrkA that had a Y785F mutation, such as TrkA Y785F, TrkA Y490F/Y785F, or TrkA Y751F/Y785F. These results indicate that the CHK-SH2 domain binds to phosphorylated Tyr-785 on the TrkA receptor. In order to confirm the expression of wild-type or mutant TrkA, the same amount of cell lysates was first immunoprecipitated and then immunoblotted with anti-TrkA antibodies. Expression levels of wild-type and mutant TrkA were similar (Fig. 5C). Furthermore, we have studied the ability of synthetic phosphopeptides to compete for the binding of the CHK-SH2 domain to TrkA receptors. We synthesized two kinds of tyrosine-phosphorylated peptides derived from the Shc binding site and the PLC-γ1 association site of TrkA receptors. A peptide containing the Shc binding site of TrkA receptors (Y*FSDTCV, where the asterisk indicates a phosphotyrosine peptide) could not compete the binding of the SH2 domain of CHK to the activated TrkA receptors (Fig. 5D). The non-tyrosine-phosphorylated control peptide (SYLDVLG) also failed to compete the binding of the SH2 domain of CHK to the activated TrkA receptors. On the other hand, a peptide containing the PLC-γ1 association site of TrkA receptors (SY*LDVLG) was able to compete the binding of the SH2 domain to the activated TrkA receptors (Fig. 5D). To further test the binding of CHK to the Tyr-785 site, we linked the tyrosine-phosphorylated SY*LDVLG peptide or the nonphosphorylated SYLDVLG peptide to Affi-Gel 15 beads, and the association of either the CHK-SH2 GST fusion protein or native CHK to the beads was analyzed. GST-CHK-SH2 was associated in a phosphotyrosine dependent manner to the phosphorylated SY*LDVLG peptide (data not shown). Similar specificity was observed when we tested the association of native CHK to the peptide beads. The phosphorylated SY*LDVLG was able to associate with native CHK from extracts of PC12 or PC12-CHK cells, whereas the nonphosphorylated peptide SYLDVLG did not associate with native CHK (data not shown). This specificity was in agreement with the peptide inhibition experiments. Taken together, these results, along with the site-directed mutagenesis of TrkA and the far Western blotting analysis, indicate that CHK binds to Tyr-785 of TrkA upon NGF stimulation. Differentiation of PC12 cells upon NGF treatment requires activation of the MAP kinase pathway (17Obermeier A. Bradshaw R.A. Seedorf K. Choidas A. Schlessinger J. Ullrich A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1585-1590Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar,18Stephens R.M. Loeb D.M. Copeland T.D. Pawson T. Greene L.A. Kaplan D.R.

Nature. 1998; 392: 622-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar). Because CHK is associated with TrkA receptors upon NGF stimulation, we assessed the effects of overexpression of CHK on activation of the p44 and p42 MAP kinases following stimulation with NGF. We stably transfected PC12 cells with CHK-pcDNA3neo, generating several PC12-CHK clones that overexpress CHK. PC12 cells and PC12-CHK clones (three independent clones of PC12-CHK) were cultured in the absence or the presence of NGF (100 ng/ml) for the indicated times, and MAP kinase activity using myelin basic protein as a substrate was assayed. Although no MAP kinase activity was detected in control PC12 or PC12-CHK cells, an increase in this activity was observed in PC12 cells upon NGF stimulation, with a peak activity at 10 min, followed by a subsequent decline in activity (Fig. 6A). In PC12 cells overexpressing CHK, MAP kinase activity was enhanced as compared with untreated PC12 cells, and this activity was maintained for longer periods of up to 60 min (Fig. 6A). In addition, p44/42 MAP kinase activity was measured using antibodies specific to the activated p44/42 MAP kinases. The phosphokinase antibodies detect p44 and p42 MAP kinases only when they are activated by phosphorylation at Tyr-204 (36Marshall C.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 179-185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4236) Google Scholar). PC12 cells and three independent PC12-CHK clones were cultured in the absence or presence of NGF (100 ng/ml) for the indicated times, and MAP kinase activity was assayed. In PC12 cells overexpressing CHK, tyrosine phosphorylation of MAP kinases was enhanced compared with untreated PC12 cells, and this phosphorylation was maintained for longer periods of up to 60 min (Fig. 6B). These results indicate a role of CHK in enhancing MAP kinase activity in PC12 cells upon NGF stimulation and thus its involvement in PC12 cell differentiation. To determine the requirement for the binding of the CHK-SH2 domain to TrkA receptors during neurite outgrowth, we examined the effects of decreasing the intracellular levels of CHK by microinjecting purified anti-CHK antibodies, anti-Csk antibodies, control preimmune rabbit antiserum, or control monoclonal antibody into living PC12 cells. Differentiation of these cells upon NGF stimulation was inhibited, as indicated by microinjection of purified anti-CHK antibodies, by morphological changes in neurite outgrowth and by rapid and dramatic changes in cell shape (cell rounding) (Fig. 7). When control antibodies or anti-Csk kinase antibodies were microinjected into PC12 cells followed by NGF stimulation, these cells were differentiated, as indicated by the appearance of prominent neurite outgrowth similar to that observed for the PC12 cells treated with NGF alone (Fig. 7). These data suggest that CHK is involved in neurite outgrowth of PC12 cells. CHK protein tyrosine kinase is found predominantly in neuronal and hematopoietic cells. In the present study, we demonstrated direct binding of CHK to the TrkA receptors, upon NGF stimulation. Furthermore, we identified the binding site of the CHK-SH2 domain to the activated TrkA receptors as residue Tyr-785. In addition, overexpression of CHK resulted in an enhanced activation of the MAP kinase pathway upon NGF stimulation of PC12 cells, whereas microinjection of CHK-specific antibodies inhibited the neurite outgrowth of PC12 cells upon NGF stimulation. These results indicate for the first time that CHK, but not Csk, is involved in TrkA signaling and in neurite outgrowth of PC12 cells. The association of the SH2 domain of CHK with activated TrkA was demonstrated using GST fusion proteins containing various domains of the CHK molecule. The association of CHK with TrkA occurred within the same time period in which tyrosine phosphorylation of TrkA was observed upon NGF stimulation. The phosphorylation of TrkA upon NGF stimulation was rapid and declined slowly, as previously reported (11Kaplan D.R. Martin-Zanca D. Parada L.F. Nature. 1991; 350: 158-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (840) Google Scholar). Our results indicated that the CHK-SH2 domain specifically interacts with the tyrosine-phosphorylated TrkA receptors upon NGF stimulation. The CHK-SH2 domain also precipitated other proteins, namely p112, p89, and p77. Although we were not yet able to identify these proteins, the possibility of their involvement in the association of CHK with TrkA signaling remains to be investigated in future studies. Far Western blotting revealed that the binding between activated TrkA and the CHK-SH2 domain is direct (Fig. 4). The SH2 domain was found to bind to activated TrkA receptors, which were tyrosine-phosphorylated upon NGF stimulation, whereas the SH3 domain or GST fusion protein failed to bind to TrkA. Therefore, the CHK-SH2 domain can bind to the activated and phosphorylated TrkA. Upon interaction with NGF, TrkA, a receptor tyrosine kinase, becomes autophosphorylated on cytoplasmic tyrosine residues (11Kaplan D.R. Martin-Zanca D. Parada L.F. Nature. 1991; 350: 158-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (840) Google Scholar, 36Marshall C.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 179-185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4236) Google Scholar), such as Tyr-490, Tyr-670, Tyr-674, Tyr-675, or Tyr-785 (14Loeb D.M. Stephens R.M. Copeland T. Kaplan D.R.

Of the several autophosphorylated residues of TrkA, three tyrosine residues, Tyr-490, Tyr-751, and Tyr-785, have been demonstrated to associate with Shc, p85/PI-3 kinase, and PLC-γ1, respectively (15Obermeier A.

All three signaling molecules, Shc, PLC-γ1, and PI-3 kinase, are demonstrated to play a major role in NGF-mediated neurite outgrowth (14Loeb D.M. Stephens R.M. Copeland T. Kaplan D.R. Greene L.A. J.

In the present study, mutation analysis revealed that residue Tyr-785 on TrkA is required for it to associate with the CHK-SH2 domain (Fig. 5). This association was also confirmed by peptide inhibition assay (Fig. 5D). The Tyr-785 site is known to bind to PLC-γ1. These results suggest that CHK and PLC-γ1 share the same tyrosine residue for binding with TrkA receptors. Interestingly, platelet-derived growth factor receptor, a receptor tyrosine kinase like TrkA, also autophosphorylates several tyrosine residues, and the tyrosine residue sites Tyr-579 and Tyr-581 are known to bind to the SH2 domains of Shc and Src family kinases (32Alonso G.

EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2257-2264Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). Therefore, the signal transduction pathway through Tyr-785 on TrkA needs to be further investigated for its potential interactions with additional signaling molecules. CHK is undetectable in early embryos and begins to be expressed around E15 (27Brinkley P.M. Class K. Bolen J.B. Penhallow R.C. Gene. 1995; 163: 179-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 40Klages S. Adam D. Class K. Bolen J.B. Penhallow R.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

It then increases progressively up to the time of birth and remains high in the adult central nervous system. CHK expression correlates with late stage development and neuronal differentiation. In contrast, Csk is expressed throughout embryonic development and remains high in the central nervous system until birth. Csk is then dramatically down-regulated in the adult brain, except in the olfactory bulb (27Brinkley P.M. Class K. Bolen J.B. Penhallow R.C. Gene. 1995; 163: 179-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 41Kuo S.S. Armanin M.P. Phillips H.S. Caras I.W. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1997; 9: 2383-2393Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Such diametrically opposite temporal expression patterns of Csk and CHK suggest distinct roles for both these proteins, presumably mediated via different substrates. Csk is known to inhibit Src family kinases, and this inhibition results in a down-regulation of the MAP kinase pathway (42Dikic I. Tokiwa G. Lev S. Courtneidge S.A. Schlessinger J. Nature. 1996; 383: 547-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (879) Google Scholar). However, our results indicate that overexpression of CHK resulted in enhanced activation of the MAP kinase pathway in PC12 cells upon NGF stimulation. In addition, we have observed that the neuronal differentiation of PC12 cells induced by NGF was inhibited by microinjection of anti-CHK antibodies, but not anti-Csk antibodies (Fig. 7), suggesting that CHK and Csk regulate different targets in the signaling pathways of neuronal cells. Thus, our findings strongly suggest that CHK plays a role in regulating the differentiation of PC12 cells. Future studies will further investigate the molecular mechanisms of the involvement of CHK in neuronal differentiation. We are grateful to Drs. Jerome E. Groopman, Sheila Zrihan-Licht, Daniel J.

Some proteases can completely digest most proteins, while others are highly selective, cleaving only one bond in a protein or a set of proteins (1Neurath H. Science. 1984; 224: 350-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). Mechanistically, four classes of proteases have been recognized, and they are named in accordance with the chemical nature of their catalytic site, namely cysteine proteases, serine proteases, aspartate proteases, and metalloproteases (Zn2+) (2Hartley B.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1960; 29: 45-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Each protease class can be further divided into protein families that are united by a common origin and a common structural fold (3Rawlings N.D. Barrett A.J. Biochem. J. 1993; 290: 205-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar). Recently, however, it has become evident that more complex relationships exist among proteases. Thus, proteolytic enzymes employing different catalytic mechanisms within the framework of the same structural fold have been identified (showing that protease families can extend across the borders separating classes (4Gorbalenya A.E.

The proteases that exhibit these unusual features are very often encoded by positive sense RNA viruses. Many of these viruses rely upon proteolytic enzymes to regulate viral and cellular gene expression and virion morphogenesis (10Kräusslich H.G. Wimmer E. Annu. Rev.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 4847-4861Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 24Hardy W.R. Strauss J.H. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 4653-4664Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Oh C.-S. Carrington J.C.

Virol. 1998; 79: 301-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) analyses. A recent x-ray analysis of the foot-and-mouth virus (FMDV) Lpro (leader protease), one of the most well characterized viral PLpros (28Ryan M.D. Flint M. J. Gen. Virol. 1997; 78: 699-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar), has proven the distant relationship between viral and cellular PLpros by showing that the FMDV Lpro adopts a compact version of the PLpro fold (29Guarne A. Tormo J. Kirchweger R. Pfistermueller D. Fita I. Skern T. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7469-7479Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Like its cellular homologues, the FMDV Lpro employs the catalytic Cys-His dyad residues, which are assisted by unique Asn and Asp residues replacing, respectively, Gln forming the oxyanion hole as well as Asn hydrogen-bonded to the catalytic His in cellular enzymes. Most probably, similar or other replacements could be found in the catalytic center of the other RNA viral PLpros (26Gorbalenya A.E. Koonin E.V. Lai M.M.C. FEBS Lett. 1991; 288: 201-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar) (see also below). It is reasonable to think that the structural diversity of RNA viral proteinases is related to the extremely high mutation rate of RNA viruses (30Holland J. Domingo E. Virus Genes. 1998; 16: 13-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). As a result, many RNA viral proteinases have diverged to the point where sequence similarity between homologues can barely be detected. One of the groups of RNA viral PLpro enzymes includes seven ortologous and paralogous coronaviral proteinases. Three coronaviruses (murine hepatitis virus (MHV) (31Lee H.J. Shieh C.K. Gorbalenya A.E.

Virology. 1995; 206: 817-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar)) encode two divergent copies of PLpro (PL1pro and PL2pro), while avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) (23Gorbalenya A.E. Koonin E.V. Donchenko A.P. Blinov V.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 4847-4861Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 26Gorbalenya A.E. Koonin E.V. Lai M.M.C.

These enzymes are produced as part of large replicative precursor proteins (pp1a and pp1ab), with pp1ab being expressed by a mechanism involving (−1) ribosomal frameshifting (36Brierley I. J. Gen. Virol. 1995; 76: 1885-1892Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). The PL1pros of MHV (37Baker S.C. Yokomori K. Dong S. Carlisle R. Gorbalenya A.E. Koonin E.V. Lai M.M. J.

Schelle B. Siddell S.G. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 910-918Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and the PLpro of IBV (42Lim K.P. Liu D.X. Virology. 1998; 245: 303-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) cleave one or two sites upstream of the protease domain. HCoV PL1pro, which is the focus of the work reported here, was previously mapped between the Gly861 and Gln1285 residues of pp1a/pp1ab. This protease releases an N-terminal protein, p9, from the pp1a/pp1ab precursors via the cleavage of the Gly111–Asn112 bond. The conserved residues Cys1054 and His1205, which were predicted to be the catalytic dyad, were found to be indispensable for proteolytic activity of the HCoV PL1pro (41Herold J. Gorbalenya A.E. Thiel V. Schelle B. Siddell S.G. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 910-918Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this paper, we predict and provide experimental evidence to show that coronaviral PLpros comprise a unique group of enzymes that rely upon a structural Zn2+ within the framework of a papain-like fold. Amino acid sequences were derived from Swiss-Prot and GenbankTM data bases, and protein structures were derived from the Brookhaven data base (Protein Data Bank, Brookhaven National Laboratory, Upton, NY). Sequence alignments were produced using a family of Clustal programs (43Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (55767) Google Scholar, 44Thompson J.D. Gibson T.J. Plewniak F. Jeanmougin F. Higgins D.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 4876-4882Crossref PubMed Scopus (35497) Google Scholar) and the Macaw workbench (45Schuler G.D. Altschul S.F. Lipman D.J. Proteins. 1991; 9: 180-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (895) Google Scholar). Nonredundant sequence data bases were searched with single sequences (46Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (59933) Google Scholar), blocks (47Henikoff S. Pietrokovski S. Henikoff J.G.

Biol. 1996; 6: 361-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (858) Google Scholar). These alignments were also sent as input for the PhD (49Rost B. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 266: 525-539Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or DSC (50King R.D. Saqi M. Sayle R. Sternberg M.J. Comput. Appl. Biosci. 1997; 13: 473-474PubMed Google Scholar) programs to predict secondary structure. The 123D program (51Alexandrov N.N. Nussinov R. Zimmer R.M. Hunter L. Klein T.E. Pacific Symposium on Biocomputing, 1996. World Scientific, Singapore1996: 53-72Google Scholar) was used for the fold prediction by threading. The structure superimposition and three-dimensional protein homology modeling (52Sanchez R. Sali A. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1997; 7: 206-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar) were done and evaluated with the help of the Quanta 97 and Whatif 4.99 (53Vriend G. Sander C. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 47-60Crossref Scopus (288) Google Scholar) packages. Analysis of the structure-based alignments was assisted by the CORE package (54Altman R.B. Hughes C. Gerstein M.B. J. Mol. Graph. 1995; 13: 142-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 55Gerstein M. Altman R.B. Comput. Appl. Biosci. 1995; 11: 633-644PubMed Google Scholar). Ribbons 2.81 (56Carson M. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 277: 493-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar) was used to display protein structures, and DSSP (57Kabsch W. Sander C. Biopolymers. 1983; 22: 2577-2637Crossref PubMed Scopus (12335) Google Scholar) was used to calculate secondary structure. Plasmid pT7-IRES-Pap, encoding amino acids (aa) 1–1315 of pp1a/pp1ab, has been described previously (41Herold J. Gorbalenya A.E. Thiel V. Schelle B. Siddell S.G. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 910-918Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). DNA was amplified from pT7-IRES-Pap by standard polymerase chain reaction procedures using oligonucleotides I (5′-ACTGCCATGGGTGGTATTTTGGCAGTAATA-3′) and II (5′-TTATCACTTGGTAGAAAGCTACATTGTC-3′). The polymerase chain reaction product was cloned into the XmnI site of pMal-c2 (New England Biolabs, Schwalbach, Germany), resulting in pMal-PL1, and the construction was verified by sequencing. Plasmid pMal-PL1 encodes an isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside-inducible fusion protein, MBP-PL1, consisting of three parts: the Escherichia coli maltose-binding protein (MBP), a linker of three artificial aa, and the HCoV PL1pro domain consisting of aa 861–1285 of pp1a/pp1ab (the so-called “minimal” trans-active protease) (41Herold J. Gorbalenya A.E. Thiel V. Schelle B. Siddell S.G. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 910-918Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A modified protocol of site-directed mutagenesis (58Herold J. Siddell S. Ziebuhr J. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 275: 68-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) was used. Two partially complementary oligonucleotides carrying the desired mutation were used in a polymerase chain reaction with plasmid DNA as template. The parental DNA was digested with DpnI, and the polymerase chain reaction products were used to transform E. coli Top 10F′ cells. In vivo recombined plasmid DNA was isolated from individual clones and sequenced. Then DNA fragments from the parental plasmids were replaced with appropriate DNA fragments from the mutated plasmids. Plasmids pMal-c2 and pMal-PL1 were used to transformE. coli TB1 cells. Single colonies were inoculated into LB medium supplemented with 100 μm ZnOAc and incubated at 37 °C until an A 600 of 0.5 was reached. Expression of the recombinant protein was induced with 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. After incubation at 25 °C for 10 h, the cells were harvested and resuspended in 3 ml of buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol)/g of cell pellet. Cells were broken with a French pressure cell (SLM Instruments Inc.), and the lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 5000 ×g for 30 min. The clarified lysate was loaded on a column containing amylose and washed with 10 column volumes of buffer A, and MBP-containing proteins were eluted using buffer A containing 10 mm maltose. The protein concentration was determined and adjusted to 1 or 2 mg/ml. The bacterially expressed recombinant proteins were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Protein preparations were stored at −70 °C. The proteolytic activity ofin vitro synthesized proteins expressed from pT7-IRES-Pap and its derivatives or the activity of bacterially expressed MBP-PL1 was assayed using in vitro synthesized, [35S]Met-labeled substrate, representing aa 1–956 of pp1a/pp1ab (41Herold J. Gorbalenya A.E. Thiel V. Schelle B. Siddell S.G. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 910-918Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The proteolytic reaction was done at 30 °C by incubation of 7 μl of the reticulocyte lysate substrate with either 20 μl of in vitro synthesized enzyme for 3 h (41Herold J. Gorbalenya A.E. Thiel V. Schelle B. Siddell S.G. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 910-918Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or 1 μg (0.5 μl) of recombinant protein for 1 h. The reaction products were immunoprecipitated with the polyclonal rabbit antiserum IS1720 (specific for aa 41–250 of pp1a/pp1ab) and analyzed by 10–17.5% gradient SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (41Herold J. Gorbalenya A.E. Thiel V. Schelle B. Siddell S.G. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 910-918Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Radioactively labeled polypeptides were visualized by autoradiography. Two 1-ml aliquots (I and II) of purified MBP-PL1 (1 mg/ml) were mixed with 9 volumes of buffer A containing 8.0 m urea. After incubation at 20 °C for 4 h, aliquot I was adjusted with EDTA to a final concentration of 10 mm, and aliquot II was adjusted with ZnOAc to a final concentration of 300 μm. The aliquots were subsequently dialyzed twice against 500 volumes of buffer A containing 1 mm EDTA (aliquot I) or 100 μmZnOAc (aliquot II) at 4 °C for 16 h. The dialyzed material was then concentrated 10-fold using Centricon-10 membranes (Amicon). The EDTA-treated sample (aliquot I) was subjected to a second round of denaturation as described above and divided into three aliquots (Ia, Ib, and Ic). Aliquot Ia was adjusted with EDTA to a final concentration of 10 mm, aliquot Ib was adjusted with ZnOAc to a final concentration of 300 μm, and aliquot Ic was adjusted with CoOAc to a final concentration of 300 μm. The aliquots were dialyzed against 500 volumes of buffer A containing 1 mm EDTA (aliquot Ia), 100 μm ZnOAc (aliquot Ib), or 100 μm CoOAc (aliquot Ic). The recombinant protein solutions were analyzed for the presence of Ca2+, Co2+, Cu2+, Fe2+, Mg2+, Mn2+, Ni2+, Pb2+, and Zn2+ by ICP-OES on a JY30 Plus spectrometer (Jobin Yvon, France). Prior to analysis, all samples were treated twice with Chelex-100 resin by mixing in suspension at 4 °C for 30 min. In this study, we have employed bioinformatics tools to gain insights into the structure and function of coronaviral PLpros. The predictions derived from these analyses have then been tested experimentally. Previously, this same strategy has proven very efficient in identifying and characterizing numerous RNA viral enzymes (for a review, see Ref. 59Gorbalenya A.E. Koonin E.V. Sov. Sci. Rev. D. Physicochem. Biol. 1993; 11: 1-84Google Scholar), including coronaviral PLpros (37Baker S.C. Yokomori K. Dong S. Carlisle R. Gorbalenya A.E. Koonin E.V. Lai M.M. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 6056-6063Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,40Bonilla P.J. Hughes S.A. Weiss S.R. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 900-909Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 41Herold J. Gorbalenya A.E. Thiel V.

First, we extended previous analyses (26Gorbalenya A.E. Koonin E.V. Lai M.M.C. FEBS Lett. 1991; 288: 201-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar, 31Lee H.J. Shieh C.K. Gorbalenya A.E.

Virology. 1995; 206: 817-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) of the primary structure of the coronavirus PL protein family using multiple sequence comparison tools (see “Experimental Procedures”). A set of multiple alignments of the conserved PL domains, consisting of aa 202–216, was generated, and an overall alignment was constructed (Fig. 1, A and C). A number of different approaches were then used to search the data bases for similarities (see “Experimental Procedures”). Only several matches of marginal statistical significance were detected with cysteine proteases, namely between the coronavirus PLpros and the Lpro of different strains of FMDV (26Gorbalenya A.E. Koonin E.V. Lai M.M.C. FEBS Lett. 1991; 288: 201-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar) and also proteases of the ubiquitin isopeptidase T family (60Wilkinson K.D. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1995; 15: 161-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). These weak similarities were structurally reasonable, since in the matches (putative) catalytic Cys or His residues were aligned (data not shown). This failure to identify a pronounced similarity between coronaviral and the other PLpros was, perhaps, not surprising given that pairwise similarity within the coronavirus PLpro family itself is very low (13–32% identical residues). Thus, to check for the existence of more remote structural similarities, which were not evident at the amino acid sequence level (61Aurora R. Rose G.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2818-2823Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), the predicted secondary structure of the coronavirus PLpros was threaded (62Alexandrov N.N. Fischer D. Proteins. 1996; 25: 354-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 63Bowie J.U. Luthy R. Eisenberg D. Science. 1991; 253: 164-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (2417) Google Scholar) through the Protein Data Bank. Even then, no high scores were returned. However, consistent with the above observations and a previous analysis (26Gorbalenya A.E. Koonin E.V. Lai M.M.C. FEBS Lett. 1991; 288: 201-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar), papain was among the three top hits (Z score was 3.16) with the catalytic cysteines of papain and the coronavirus PLpros being matched (data not shown). It is also noteworthy that coronaviral PLpros were predicted to belong to the α + β structural class, which also includes cellular PLpros. Thus, we were encouraged to elaborate our model by producing a secondary structure-based alignment of seven coronaviral and 11 cellular PLpros, whose tertiary structures have been solved. This alignment includes 10 ungapped blocks encompassing the majority of the (predicted) structural elements of the two protein sets and has interblock spacing that is similar in the proteases of both cellular and viral origin (Fig. 1A). The interfamily amino acid conservation is most evident in blocks II, IV, VI, and VIII, which contain both catalytic and substrate-binding pocket residues of the cellular enzymes and four out of eight absolutely conserved residues of the viral enzymes (three in block II and one in block VIII). Three other invariant residues are located between blocks V and VI and described below. The eighth coronaviral invariant residue, Asp, is located in block IX. In an alignment slightly different from that shown in Fig. 1A, this residue would correspond to a highly conserved Asn, which is hydrogen-bonded to catalytic His residue of cellular enzymes. However, this alternative alignment was not favored by the MACAW-assisted analysis or by the results of a site-directed mutagenesis study (see below). In this respect, it is worth noting that the conserved Asn of cellular PLpros does not play the catalytic role (64Vernet T. Tessier D.C. Chatellier J. Plouffe C. Lee T.S. Thomas D.Y. Storer A.C. Menard R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16645-16652Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) and is substituted by Lys in stem bromelain, one of the plant PLpros (65Ritonja A. Rowan A.D. Buttle D.J. Rawlings N.D. Turk V. Barrett A.J. FEBS Lett. 1989; 247: 419-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Importantly, in the alignment shown in Fig. 1A, the coronavirus PL residues match the majority (77 out of 91) of cellular PL residues with a low space variation (the so-called core residues (55Gerstein M. Altman R.B. Comput. Appl. Biosci. 1995; 11: 633-644PubMed Google Scholar)) and only a minority (32 out of 87) of structurally less conserved residues (Fig. 1, A and B). Taken together, all of the above observations strongly imply that the coronaviral PLpros may adopt a variant of the α + β fold conserved in cellular PLpros. In the alignment displayed in Fig. 1A, three structural elements of the cellular PLpros, βA, βB, and α-RII, which are spatially juxtaposed in front of the substrate-binding pocket and comprise a peripheral part of the right-hand domain (Fig. 1B), were not aligned with coronaviral sequences. Two of these elements, βA and α-RII, form part of a long, poorly conserved structure found in the middle of the cellular PLpros (66Kamphuis I.G. Drenth J. Baker E.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1985; 182: 317-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). The corresponding region between blocks V and VI in the coronaviral PLpros was highly diverged, but, most conspicuously, it was found to contain a unique conserved sequence pattern characteristic of Zn2+ fingers, CX 1–2CX 22–31CX 1–2-[CH], where X is any aa (Fig. 1C). When the predicted HCoV PL1pro Zn2+ finger was compared with the structural data base of Zn2+ fingers (67Schwabe J.W. Klug A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 345-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar, 68Hubbard T.J.P. Murzin A.G. Brenner S.E. Chothia C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 236-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar), the nucleic acid binding domain of human transcriptional elongation factor TFIIS, which has a three-stranded, antiparallel, β-sheet fold (zinc ribbon) (69Qian X. Gozani S.N. Yoon H. Jeon C.J. Agarwal K. Weiss M.A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9944-9959Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), was selected as being the most similar. Both proteins are enriched with β-strands, belong to the C4 class, have a similar spacing between the pair of the C2 halves, and have a variable spacing separating cysteines within the C2 elements (or cysteine and histidine in the CH element of related proteins) (Fig. 1C). The zinc ribbon architecture is apparently conserved in a wide variety of Zn2+ fingers (69Qian X. Gozani"

Because the mitogen-activated protein kinase family members extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs), p38, and c-Jun N-terminal kinase are widely implicated in such cellular functions, we measured their activity in growing and growth-arrested cultures of bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMM), as well as their stimulation by saturating concentrations of CSF-1. ERK activity was approximately 2-fold higher in cycling BMM compared with growth-arrested BMM; in addition, CSF-1-stimulated BMM DNA synthesis was partially inhibited by PD98059, a specific inhibitor of MEK activation, suggesting a role for a mitogen-activated protein-ERK kinase (MEK)/ERK pathway in the control of DNA synthesis but surprisingly not in the control of cyclin D1 mRNA or c-myc mRNA expression. The suppression of BMM apoptosis by CSF-1, i.e. enhanced survival, was not reversed by PD98059, suggesting that a MEK/ERK pathway is not involved in this process.Using a quantitative kinase assay, it was found that CSF-1 gave a slight increase in BMM p38 activity, supporting prior data that CSF-1 is a relatively weak stimulator of inflammatory cytokine production in monocytes/macrophages. Relatively high concentrations of the p38 inhibitor, SKB202190, suppressed CSF-1-stimulated BMM DNA synthesis. No evidence could be obtained for the involvement of p38 activity in BMM apoptosis following CSF-1 withdrawal. We were not able to show that CSF-1 enhanced BMM JNK-1 activity to a significant extent; again, no role could be found for JNK-1 activity in the BMM apoptosis occurring after CSF-1 removal.

In addition to being necessary for proliferation, colony stimulating factor-1 (CSF-1) 1The abbreviations used are: CSF-1, colony stimulating factor-1; BMM: bone marrow-derived macrophages, LPS, lipopolysaccharide; TNF, tumor necrosis factor; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; p38/CSBP, cytokine suppressive anti-inflammatory drug-binding protein (also known as reactivating kinase); JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase; MAP kinase, mitogen-activated protein kinase; MEK, MAP-ERK kinase; MTT, 3-(4,5-dimethyl thiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide; FBS, fetal bovine serum; TBST, Tris-buffered saline containing 0.5% Triton X-100; TUNEL, terminal deoxynucleotidyltranserase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling; 8BrcAMP, 8-bromo-cAMP; GST, glutathione S-transferase. 1The abbreviations used are: CSF-1, colony stimulating factor-1; BMM: bone marrow-derived macrophages, LPS, lipopolysaccharide; TNF, tumor necrosis factor; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; p38/CSBP, cytokine suppressive anti-inflammatory drug-binding protein (also known as reactivating kinase); JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase; MAP kinase, mitogen-activated protein kinase; MEK, MAP-ERK kinase; MTT, 3-(4,5-dimethyl thiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide; FBS, fetal bovine serum; TBST, Tris-buffered saline containing 0.5% Triton X-100; TUNEL, terminal deoxynucleotidyltranserase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling; 8BrcAMP, 8-bromo-cAMP; GST, glutathione S-transferase. or macrophage CSF is absolutely required for the continued survival of certain populations of cells of the monocyte/macrophage lineage (1Tushinski R.J. Oliver I.T. Guilbert L.J. Tynan W. Warner J.R. Stanley E.R. Cell. 1982; 28: 71-81Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence suggest that the maintenance of survival and the stimulation of proliferation are mediated by either different signaling pathways activated by the CSF-1 receptor or require different thresholds of activation of similar pathways (2Tushinski R.J. Stanley E.R. J. Cell. Physiol. 1983; 116: 67-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 3Pollard J.W. Morgan C.J. Dello Sbarba P. Cheers C. Stanley E.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Advances have been made in describing the signal transduction molecules activated in response to CSF-1 stimulation of macrophages, although the details of the pathways leading to their activation are still in many cases unresolved (5Hamilton J.A. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1997; 62: 145-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). The role of the CSF-1 receptor in controlling passage through the G1 phase of the cell cycle has been relatively well studied, and it has been shown, for example, for cell cycle progression that continued stimulation by CSF-1 is required for the synthesis of d-type cyclins as is the up-regulation of c-myc (6Roussel M.F. Cleveland J.L. Shurtleff S.A. Sherr C.J. Nature. 1991; 353: 361-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 7Langer S.J. Bortner D.M. Roussel M.F. Sherr C.J. Ostrowski M.C. Mol. Cell.

A. 1995; 92: 6837-6841Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Relatively little, however, is known about the signal transduction pathways activated by CSF-1 involved in maintaining cell survival.Recent research has suggested roles for different members of the MAP kinase family (ERKs, p38/(CSBP), JNK (stress-activated protein kinase)) in promoting either cell survival and/or proliferation, in response to growth factor stimulation, or apoptosis, in response to various stress stimuli. There are many examples where enhanced ERK activity has been implicated in growth factor-mediated cell survival and/or proliferation (for example, see Ref. 9L'Allemain G. Prog. Growth Factor Res. 1994; 5: 291-334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar for review); significant downstream responses of ERK-dependent signal transduction pathways that have been proposed to be important for cell cycle progression are cyclin D1 and c-myc transcription, including in CSF-1-stimulated NIH-3T3 cells expressing the CSF-1 receptor (c-Fms) (Ref. 10Aziz N. Cherwinski H. McMahon M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1101-1115Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar and references therein). The relationship between ERK activation and other responses in macrophages is, however, much more complicated than the above discussion suggests. In this cell type, activation of ERKs has not been found to correlate strongly with the level of subsequent DNA synthesis (11Jaworowski A. Christy E. Yusoff P. Byrne R. Hamilton J.A. Biochem. J. 1996; 320: 1011-1016Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 12Wilson N.J. Jaworowski A. Ward A.C. Hamilton J.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 244: 475-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), and there is some evidence to suggest that there may be Ras-independent control over ERK activity (5Hamilton J.A. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1997; 62: 145-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Also, in macrophages, elevated intracellular cAMP enhances CSF-1-stimulated ERK activity while suppressing the corresponding rise in cyclin D1 mRNA, suggesting a possible dissociation (12Wilson N.J. Jaworowski A. Ward A.C. Hamilton J.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 244: 475-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar).The p38 and JNK cascades are primarily activated by various environmental stresses: proinflammatory cytokines (TNFα and interleukin-1), osmotic shock, ultraviolet radiation, heat shock, x-ray irradiation, hydrogen peroxide, and protein synthesis inhibitors (for review, see Ref. 13Kyriakis J.M. Avruch J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24313-24316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1024) Google Scholar). They have also been proposed to be involved in the regulation of apoptosis, because, for example, overexpression of kinases that activate them resulted in the induction of apoptosis (14Xia Z. Dickens M. Raingeaud J. Davis R.J. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1995; 270: 1326-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (5027) Google Scholar,15Ichijo H. Nishida E. Irie K. ten Dijke P. Saitoh M. Moriguchi T. Takagi M. Matsumoto K. Miyazono K. Gotoh Y. Science. 1997; 275: 90-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (1999) Google Scholar), withdrawal of a growth factor (nerve growth factor) from PC-12 cultures can result in a transient activation of the p38 and JNK families (14Xia Z. Dickens M. Raingeaud J. Davis R.J. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1995; 270: 1326-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (5027) Google Scholar), and inhibition of p38 MAP kinase activity can suppress apoptosis (16Kummer J.L. Rao P.K. Heidenreich K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20490-20494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). Contrary to its role in cellular stress responses, it has recently been reported that CSF-1 activates p38 activity in a myeloid cell line, and a role for this enzyme in hemopoietic cell proliferation was postulated (17Foltz I.N. Lee J.C. Young P.R. Schrader J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3296-3301Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). p38 also has a well established role in cytokine production by lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-activated macrophages (18Lee J.C. Laydon J.T. McDonnell P.C. Gallagher T.F. Kumar S. Green D. McNulty D. Blumenthal M.J. Heys J.R. Landvatter S.W. Strickler J.E. McLaughlin M.M. Siemans I.R. Fisher S.M. Livi G.P. White J.R. Adams J.L. Young P.R. Nature. 1994; 372: 739-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (3121) Google Scholar). However, there has been controversy as to whether CSF-1 is a strong stimulator of cytokine production in macrophages relative to stimuli such as LPS (for review, see Ref. 19Hamilton J.A. Immunol. Today. 1993; 14: 18-24Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Reports from our laboratory and those of others have shown that CSF-1 treatment of monocytes and macrophages does not lead to high levels of secreted proinflammatory cytokine production (19Hamilton J.A. Immunol. Today. 1993; 14: 18-24Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 20Hamilton J.A. Whitty G.A. Stanton H. Meager A. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1993; 53: 707-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). It is therefore of interest to know whether CSF-1 is a potent stimulator of p38 activity in cells of the macrophage lineage and what the significance of such stimulation may be.From the above background information, it is clear that the role of the MAP kinase family in cell survival and/or proliferation is cell type- and/or stimulus-specific. It has been maintained before (5Hamilton J.A. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1997; 62: 145-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) that the relevance of signal transduction pathways to the cell biology of a growth factor such as CSF-1 must be analyzed in each individual case and is best studied in cells where the receptor (c-Fms) is normally expressed and preferably in primary cultures of such cells rather than in immortalized cell lines, where proliferation and survival pathways are, ipso facto, altered. We therefore have examined the roles of the MAP kinase family members, including potentially dependent pathways, in CSF-1-treated murine bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMM); because BMM depend upon CSF-1 for survival (1Tushinski R.J. Oliver I.T. Guilbert L.J. Tynan W. Warner J.R. Stanley E.R. Cell. 1982; 28: 71-81Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar), we also examined the activities of the MAP kinase family members upon CSF-1 withdrawal. We report evidence for some involvement of ERK activity in CSF-1-stimulated BMM DNA synthesis but, interestingly, and in contrast to reports in fibroblasts ectoptically expressing c-fms, no evidence for its involvement in the control of cyclin D1 or c-myc mRNA expression. p38 activity was weakly induced by CSF-1. No data were obtained to support a role for p38 or JNK-1 in BMM apoptosis resulting from CSF-1 withdrawal.DISCUSSIONIn the above studies we tested the effects on BMM functions of PD98059, a highly specific inhibitor of MEK activation widely used to determine the involvement of a MEK/ERK pathway in particular cell functions (28Cohen P. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 7: 353-361Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (515) Google Scholar). In general, an inhibitor of an intracellular target, even though it may not be exquisitely specific, can provide evidence that is consistent with a role for its target in a particular cellular response (for example, to a growth factor); if its action is very effective on its target but does not affect a particular cellular response, then it is likely that the target of the inhibitor is not required for that response. We have demonstrated above that ERK-1 activity is maintained at a higher level in cycling BMM than in cells from which the CSF-1 was removed (Table I; Fig. 1a) but, using PD98059, no evidence could be found for its involvement in the CSF-1-stimulated enhancement of BMM survival (i.e. reversal of apoptosis) (Fig. 2). Even though enhanced BMM ERK activity does not correlate with enhanced DNA synthesis (11Jaworowski A. Christy E. Yusoff P. Byrne R. Hamilton J.A. Biochem. J. 1996; 320: 1011-1016Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 12Wilson N.J. Jaworowski A. Ward A.C. Hamilton J.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 244: 475-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) because, for example, a nonmitogenic stimulus such as LPS can enhance ERK activity, PD98059 suppressed somewhat the CSF-1-stimulated BMM DNA synthesis (Table II); assuming that PD98059 is specific for the ERK pathway under the conditions used (28Cohen P. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 7: 353-361Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (515) Google Scholar), this suppression suggests MEK/ERK involvement in a pathway(s) critical for the progression into S-phase in this system. The elevated ERK activity in cycling BMM is consistent with this conclusion and suggests that ERK activation may be necessary but not sufficient for macrophage proliferation.In a number of other cell systems, it is widely concluded that enhanced ERK activity leads to transcription of cyclin D1 and c-mycgenes with subsequent progression into S phase. However, in CSF-1-stimulated BMM we did not find that PD98059 inhibited cyclin D1 mRNA or c-myc mRNA expression (Fig. 3a), observations at odds with other systems including CSF-1-stimulated NIH 3T3 cells, which had been transfected with the CSF-1R, c-fms(Ref. 10Aziz N. Cherwinski H. McMahon M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1101-1115Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar and references therein). Interestingly, when the induction of cyclin D1 protein was monitored by Western blotting, we found in preliminary experiments that PD98059 (≥50 μm) did suppress it (data not shown). Because PD98059 blocked CSF-1-induced c-fos mRNA expression (Ref. 12Wilson N.J. Jaworowski A. Ward A.C. Hamilton J.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 244: 475-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar; Fig. 3b), it is possible that a MEK/ERK/c-Fos-dependent pathway is relevant for DNA synthesis control in CSF-1-treated BMM; of possible relevance also is the recent report that persistent ERK activation by CSF-1 is necessary for both expression and post-translational activation of ets-2 in macrophages (30Fowles L.F. Martin M.L. Nelsen L. Stacey K.J. Redd D. Clark Y.M. Nagamine Y. McMahon M. Hume D.A. Ostrowski M.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5148-5156Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar).The actions of PD98059 differ from those of another inhibitor of CSF-1-stimulated BMM DNA synthesis, albeit a more potent one, namely 8BrcAMP (12Wilson N.J. Jaworowski A. Ward A.C. Hamilton J.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 244: 475-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). This cAMP analogue blocked the CSF-1-stimulated cyclin D1 and c-myc mRNA expression (Refs. 25Cocks B.J. Vairo G. Bodrug S.E. Hamilton J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12307-12310Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar and 34Vadiveloo P.K. Vairo G. Novak U. Royston A.K. Whitty G. Filonzi E.L. Cragoe Jr., E.J. Hamilton J.A. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 599-608PubMed Google Scholar; Fig. 3a) while raising c-fos mRNA expression and ERK activity (12Wilson N.J. Jaworowski A. Ward A.C. Hamilton J.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 244: 475-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 24Vairo G. Argyriou S. Bordun A.-M Whitty G. Hamilton J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2692-2701Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, 8BrcAMP, like PD98059, could not prevent the reversal of BMM apoptosis by CSF-1 (Fig. 2); interestingly, the combination of the two agents did so, suggesting perhaps they control complementary pathways emanating from the stimulated CSF-1 receptor, which are each important for cell survival and possibly for other cellular responses. We have found before that 8BrcAMP inhibited CSF-1-induced Ras activity (12Wilson N.J. Jaworowski A. Ward A.C. Hamilton J.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 244: 475-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), raising once again the possibility of the presence of a Ras-independent pathway controlling ERK activity in macrophages (5Hamilton J.A. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1997; 62: 145-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar); perhaps enhanced Ras activity but not ERK activity is relevant for subsequent cyclin D1 mRNA or c-myc mRNA expression in CSF-1-stimulated macrophages.p38 MAP kinase has been shown in a variety of cell systems to be strongly activated by stress signals such as osmotic shock, UV light, LPS, and inflammatory cytokines but to be activated only weakly by growth factors (see Refs. 13Kyriakis J.M. Avruch J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24313-24316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1024) Google Scholar and 27Marshall C.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 179-185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4222) Google Scholar for reviews). p38 is known to be involved in the control of cytokine production (e.g. TNFα in LPS-activated macrophages (18Lee J.C. Laydon J.T. McDonnell P.C. Gallagher T.F. Kumar S. Green D. McNulty D. Blumenthal M.J. Heys J.R. Landvatter S.W. Strickler J.E. McLaughlin M.M. Siemans I.R. Fisher S.M. Livi G.P. White J.R. Adams J.L. Young P.R. Nature. 1994; 372: 739-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (3121) Google Scholar)). Some reports but not others have found that CSF-1 is a relatively poor stimulator of inflammatory cytokine synthesis (e.g. TNFα, interleukin-1) in monocytes/macrophages in vitro (19Hamilton J.A. Immunol. Today. 1993; 14: 18-24Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 20Hamilton J.A. Whitty G.A. Stanton H. Meager A. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1993; 53: 707-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 38Oster W. Brach M.A. Gruss H.J. Mertelsmann R. Herrmann F. Blood. 1992; 79: 1260-1265Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 39Moore R.N. Oppenheim J.J. Farrar J.J. Carter Jr., C.S. Waheed A. Shadduck R.K. J. Immunol. 1980; 125: 1302-1305PubMed Google Scholar, 40Evans R. Duffy T.M. Blake S.S. Lin H.S. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1989; 46: 428-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). However, it has been reported that CSF-1 causes an increase in tyrosine phosphorylation in p38 immunoprecipitates in the myeloid cell line, FD-MACII cells (17Foltz I.N. Lee J.C. Young P.R. Schrader J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3296-3301Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). This type of analysis does not measure enzymatic activation nor give any indication as to the degree of activation of this enzyme. We therefore decided to measure p38 activity by a specific and quantitative immunoprecipitation kinase assay in cultures of primary macrophages and to compare directly the activity induced by CSF-1 treatment to that resulting from the action of LPS. Our data show that in BMM the stimulation by CSF-1 of p38 enzymatic activity is very small compared with that stimulated by LPS (Fig. 4a) and is kinetically distinguishable from the latter (data not shown). These findings are entirely consistent with the reports from our laboratory and those of others that show that CSF-1 is a weak stimulator of cytokine biosynthesis in monocytes and macrophages compared with LPS and offer an explanation for these findings. The kinetics of p38 activation by CSF-1 and LPS are similar to those that we, and others, have previously observed for ERK-1 activation in the same cells and by the same stimuli (11Jaworowski A. Christy E. Yusoff P. Byrne R. Hamilton J.A. Biochem. J. 1996; 320: 1011-1016Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), although there are clear differences in the extent of activation. Thus CSF-1 activates both enzymes maximally at 5 min in growth-arrested cells, whereas LPS activates them maximally at 15 min; furthermore, LPS is a strong activator of both MAP kinase family members, whereas CSF-1 is a weak activator of the p38 enzyme relative to its effects on the ERK isoforms. Whether the activation of these enzymes by CSF-1 and LPS represents activation of the same intracellular pools is not clear, but in this context it is of interest that a recent report has shown that LPS preferentially activates a minor microtubule-bound subpopulation of MAP kinase (41Ding A. Chen B. Fuortes M. Blum E. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 1899-1904Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar).The p38 pathway has been implicated to play a critical role in apoptosis, because many apoptotic signals are able to stimulate p38 activity, and p38 activation is correlated with the induction of apoptosis in several cell types (14Xia Z. Dickens M. Raingeaud J. Davis R.J. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1995; 270: 1326-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (5027) Google Scholar, 15Ichijo H. Nishida E. Irie K. ten Dijke P. Saitoh M. Moriguchi T. Takagi M. Matsumoto K. Miyazono K. Gotoh Y. Science. 1997; 275: 90-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (1999) Google Scholar, 16Kummer J.L. Rao P.K. Heidenreich K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20490-20494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar); however, others have found no correlation between its activation and apoptosis in other cell types and even found some activation by growth factors (see for example Refs.17Foltz I.N. Lee J.C. Young P.R. Schrader J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3296-3301Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 42Nagata Y. Moriguchi T. Nishida E. Todokoro K. Blood. 1997; 80: 929-934Crossref Google Scholar). Inhibition of p38 activity has been shown to suppress apoptosis in some cases (see for example Ref. 16Kummer J.L. Rao P.K. Heidenreich K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20490-20494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar) but not in others (43Salmon R.A. Foltz I.N. Young P.R. Schrader J.W. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 5309-5317PubMed Google Scholar) and to even induce apoptosis (44Nemoto S. Xiang J. Huang S. Lin A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16415-16420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). In BMM (Fig. 4b) and the macrophage cell line BAC.1.2F5 (data not shown), we found a gradual decrease in p38 activity following CSF-1 withdrawal; furthermore, SKB202190 failed to inhibit the decrease in BMM viability (Fig. 4c). Our data, therefore, do not support a role for p38 family members, at least those that are susceptible to pyridinyl imidazole inhibition, in macrophage cell death resulting from growth factor deprivation and indicate that CSF-1 does not maintain cell viability by suppressing p38 activity. The significance of the elevated p38 activity in cycling BMM awaits clarification. p38 activity may play a permissive role in CSF-1-driven macrophage proliferation because SKB202190 blocked CSF-1-stimulated BMM DNA synthesis, and our preliminary data suggest that it inhibits the induction of c-myc mRNA but not cyclin D1 mRNA; however, it should be noted that the concentrations required were much higher than those needed to inhibit the in vitro BMM p38 activity, suggesting that the drug might have alternative targets in BMM at the higher concentrations.JNK activity in various cell types can be enhanced by a similar range of stress signals as p38 activity and be weakly activated by growth factors (13Kyriakis J.M. Avruch J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24313-24316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1024) Google Scholar). We could find no evidence for an activation of JNK-1 activity in CSF-1-treated BMM above the very low levels found in the untreated population. In contrast, LPS and TNFα both gave significant increases; LPS has been shown previously to stimulate JNK activity in macrophages (45Hambleton J. Weinstein S.L. Lem L. DeFranco A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2774-2778Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). In BMM we found no detectable increase in JNK activity as they proceeded to the apoptotic state and, therefore, no support for its role in the control of apoptosis in these cells.In summary, the lack of association of MAP kinase family members with apoptosis and/or survival in the macrophages again highlights the need to explore the relevance of a signaling pathway to cellular function for each particular cell type; also, the atypical evidence presented above that ERK activity may not be controlling cyclin D1 mRNA and c-myc mRNA expression in CSF-1-stimulated BMM but does so in CSF-1-treated NIH 3T3 cells (cf. present paper and Ref. 10Aziz N. Cherwinski H. McMahon M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1101-1115Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) again indicates that CSF-1 biology and associated signal transduction pathways are best studied in myeloid cells (5Hamilton J.A. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1997; 62: 145-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). The relatively weak stimulation of p38 activity by CSF-1 compared with that resulting from LPS action contrasts some actions of CSF-1 (a survival and growth factor) with those of LPS (a stress stimulus) and is consistent with some reports (19Hamilton J.A. Immunol. Today. 1993; 14: 18-24Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 20Hamilton J.A. Whitty G.A. Stanton H. Meager A. J.

Using site-directed mutagenesis of yeastGDI1, we demonstrate that amino acid residues required for Rab recognition in vitro are critical for function in vivo in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Analysis of the effects of Rab-binding mutants on function in vivo reveals that only a small pool of recycling Rab protein is essential for growth, and that the rates of recycling of distinct Rabs are differentially sensitive to GDI. Furthermore, we find that membrane association of Gdi1p is Rab-independent. Mutant Gdi1 proteins unable to bind Rabs were able to associate with cellular membranes as efficiently as wild-type Gdi1p, yet caused a striking loss of the endogenous cytosolic Gdi1p-Rab pools leading to dominant inhibition of growth when expressed at levels of the normal, endogenous pool. These results demonstrate a potential role for a new recycling factor in the retrieval of Rab-GDP from membranes, and illustrate the importance of multiple effectors in regulating GDI function in Rab delivery and retrieval from membranes.

Cheney C.M. Novick P.J. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1718-1728Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Southern blot analyses of genomic DNA indicate that both mouse and rat contain at least five rab GDI genes (6Janoueix-Lerosey I. Jollivet F. Camonis J. Marche P.N. Goud B. J. Biol.

GDI family members are closely related to members of the CHM/REP gene family involved in Rab prenylation (reviewed in Ref. 7Casey P.J. Seabra M.C. J. Biol.

Trends Biochem. 1996; 21: 472-476Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). While other Rab effector proteins, including guanine nucleotide exchange factors or GTPase activating proteins, exhibit specificity for individual Rab proteins, GDI family members recognize all Rab proteins examined to date (8Ullrich O.

This has led to the proposal that GDI/REP family members principally function in maintaining a cytosolic reservoir of Rab proteins for delivery to membranes. We have solved the structure of bovine α-GDI at 1.81-Å resolution using x-ray crystallography (10Schalk I. Zeng K. Wu S.-K. Stura E.A. Matteson J. Huang M. Tandon A. Wilson I.A. Balch W.E. Nature. 1996; 381: 42-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). α-GDI is constructed of two main structural units, a large multisheet domain I and a smaller α-helical domain II. Domain I is largely composed of sequence conserved regions (SCRs) which are common to all members of the GDI superfamily. SCRs located in the NH2-terminal and central portions of the molecule fold to form a compact structural unit at the apex of GDI. In particular, SCRs 1 and 3B contain tri- and tetrapeptide motifs that are invariant from yeast to man (11Waldherr M. Ragnini A. Schweyen R.J. Boguski M.S. Nature Genet. 1993; 3: 193-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The polar side chains of amino acids in these motifs are directed away from the α-carbon backbone, suggestive of a role in the recognition of other proteins. Selected residues in SCRs 1 and 3B have been implicated for the binding of Rab3Ain vitro and for the ability of α-GDI to extract the GDP-bound forms of Rab3A from permeabilized rat brain synaptosomes (10Schalk I. Zeng K. Wu S.-K. Stura E.A. Matteson J. Huang M. Tandon A. Wilson I.A. Balch W.E. Nature. 1996; 381: 42-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Recently, we have found that residues involved in Rab recognition have differential effects on Rab1 binding and ER to Golgi transportin vitro (12Wu S.-K. Luan P. Matteson J. Zeng K. Nishimura N. Balch W.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26931-26938Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). These residues, in addition to other highly conserved residues distributed throughout the NH2-terminal half and central half of GDI are grouped on only one face of the molecule, leading us to previously speculate that this face is involved in most, if not all, important features of GDI/CHM biological function (13Schalk I.J. Stura E.A. Matteson J. Wilson I.A. Balch W.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 244: 469-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). The critical role of GDI family members in the regulation of membrane transport throughout the endocytic and exocytic pathways stresses the importance of understanding the contribution of individual amino acid residues in directing interaction of GDI not only with Rab, but importantly, upstream or downstream effectors involved in Rab recycling. The fact that the yeast S. cerevisiae contains only a single copy of GDI1 which is essential for cell growth (5Garrett M.D. Zahner J.E. Cheney C.M. Novick P.J. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1718-1728Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) provides an excellent tool to extend our previous studies on GDI function in ER to Golgi transport in vitro using mammalian cells (12Wu S.-K. Luan P. Matteson J. Zeng K. Nishimura N. Balch W.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26931-26938Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). To date, only one additional factor, a guanine nucleotide displacement factor has been proposed to function in the GDI-Rab cycle, in this case facilitating the delivery of Rab to membranes by interaction with the GDI-Rab cytosolic pool (14Soldati T. Shapiro A.D. Svejstrup A.B.D. Pfeffer S.R. Nature. 1994; 369: 76-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 15Ullrich O. Horiuchi H. Bucci C. Zerial M.

We now report evidence for a new factor involved in GDI functionin vivo. We find that single point mutations in yeastGDI1 codons encoding homologous residues of α-GDI involved in Rab3A binding and membrane extraction in vitro (10Schalk I. Zeng K. Wu S.-K. Stura E.A. Matteson J. Huang M. Tandon A. Wilson I.A. Balch W.E. Nature. 1996; 381: 42-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) exhibit reduced Rab binding in vivo yet retained partial Gdi1p function in support of growth and transport. These results establish for the first time the physiological importance of the putative Rab-binding platform found at the apex of GDI for functionin vivo and that a functional excess of GDI-Rab complexes are present in living cells. Strikingly, selected residues involved in Rab binding in vitro, when combined in double mutants, had dominant effects on growth, were found to render GDI completely defective in Rab binding in vivo, failed to complement vesicular transport and growth defects of gdi1Δ andgdi1 temperature-sensitive mutations, and led to the accumulation of Rabs on membranes. Despite these changes, these double mutants bound membranes as efficiently as wild-type Gdi1p in vivo and in vitro. The implication of these results on the mechanism of GDI function in the delivery and retrieval of the Rab-GDP from membranes following vesicle fusion reveals a potential role for a rab recycling factor that mediates GDI-dependent retrieval of Rab-GDP. Yeast strains were grown in standard yeast extract, peptone, dextrose (YPD) (17Sherman F. Fink G.R. Lawrence L.W. Methods in Yeast Genetics: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1979Google Scholar), yeast extract, peptone, fructose (YPF), or synthetic media (SM) supplemented with 2% casamino acids and essential amino acid supplements (17Sherman F. Fink G.R. Lawrence L.W. Methods in Yeast Genetics: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1979Google Scholar) as required for maintenance of plasmids. Transformation of Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains was done by the lithium acetate method (18Ito H. Fukuda Y. Murata K. Kimura A. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 153: 163-168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with single-stranded DNA employed as carrier (19Schiestl R.H. Gietz R.D. Curr. Genet. 1989; 16: 339-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (1782) Google Scholar). Standard bacterial media was used for Escherichia coli cultures. E. coli transformations were done as described (20Hanahan D. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 166: 557-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (8242) Google Scholar). S. cerevisiae strains used for these studies are as follows. A gdi1Δ strain (CBY71) was constructed by transformation of a wild-type diploid strain (SEY 6210a/α) with a CENURA3 plasmid containing GDI1, and then transformation of this strain with thegdi1Δ::HIS3 deletion-disruption construct (described below). After confirming by polymerase chain reaction that this strain contained one intact and one disrupted copy of GDI1, it was sporulated and colonies derived from Ura+ His+ spores were identified. Thesec19-1 strain, CBY47 (sec19-1 ura3-52 trp1-Δ901 leu2-3, 112 his3-Δ200), was constructed by crossing NY420 (sec19-1 ura3-52) to a wild-type strain (SEY 6210), sporulating this strain and identifying colonies which did not grow at 37 °C. Standard DNA manipulations (21.Maniatis, T., Fritsch, E. F., and Sambrook, J. (1982).Google Scholar) were used with restriction endonucleases and modification enzymes from Roche Molecular Biochemicals, New England Biolabs, or U. S. Biochemical Corp. Thegdi1Δ::HIS3 construct was generated by replacing the DNA fragment encoding amino acids 17 through 414 of Gdi1p with a DNA fragment containing the HIS3 gene. The gene SOEing technique (22Dascher C. Balch W.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1437-1448Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was used to make gdi1 point mutants with DNA oligonucleotides from Life Technologies, Inc. All mutants were sequenced to confirm that only the intended mutations were present. Yeast cultures were radiolabeled using previously published procedures (23Horazdovsky B.F. Emr S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4953-4962Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Horazdovsky B. Busch G.R. Emr S.D. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1297-1309Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Strains were labeled with FM4-64 (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) as described (25Vida T.A. Emr S.D. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 779-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (1144) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitations of CPY were done as described (26Klionsky D.J. Banta L.M. Emr S.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 2105-2116Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Native immunoprecipitations of HA epitope-tagged Gdi1p proteins were done with a monoclonal antibody which recognizes the HA epitope (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Cells were lysed (15 OD600 unit per 1 ml) in standard lysis buffer (20 mm HEPES (pH 6.2), 200 mm sorbitol, 100 mm potassium acetate, 2 mm magnesium chloride, 1 mm dithiothreitol) and subjected to centrifugation(s) as described under “Results.” Anti-HA antibody was added (5 μl per ml of extract), incubated with rocking at 4 °C for 4 h, and immunoprecipitated with Gamma Bind G-Sepharose (Pharmacia). For subcellular fractionation studies, spheroplasts made from cells were labeled and processed as described in Ref. 27Gaynor E.C. Heesen S. Graham T.R. Aebi M. Emr S.D. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 653-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar. After clearing extracts of unbroken cells, lysates were centrifuged at 100,000 ×g for 1 h to yield P100 particulate (membrane) and S100 soluble (cytosolic) fractions. Fractions were precipitated with trichloroacetic acid and then processed for immunoprecipitation with polyclonal rabbit antisera raised against various yeast Rab proteins. To map amino acid residues of yeast Gdi1p that are important for function, a plasmid shuffle-based complementation assay (17Sherman F. Fink G.R. Lawrence L.W. Methods in Yeast Genetics: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1979Google Scholar) was developed that allowed rapid screening of site-directed point mutants for the ability to complement a gdi1Δ null mutation. Plasmids (CENLEU2) containing site-directed mutations were used to transform a gdi1Δ::HIS3 strain containing a CENURA3 GDI1 plasmid as the sole source of wild-type Gdi1p. Transformed strains were streaked to 5-fluoroorotic acid plates to select for loss of the URA3 GDI1 plasmid leaving the mutantgdi1 gene as the only source of Gdi1p. Growth of the resultant strains was assayed after restreaking to rich medium. This method allowed us to assess if any gdi1 mutants constructed were able to supply the essential function of GDI1. As a test to confirm the feasibility of this approach, two separate point mutations (I13R or T256P) were introduced into GDI1. Based on the crystal structure (10Schalk I. Zeng K. Wu S.-K. Stura E.A. Matteson J. Huang M. Tandon A. Wilson I.A. Balch W.E. Nature. 1996; 381: 42-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), we predicted that each of these point mutations (Fig. 1) would affect the structural integrity of the Rab-binding region of Gdi1p and lead to a complete loss of function. As expected, each of these mutants failed to yield Leu+ Ura− strains after streaking to 5-fluoroorotic acid plates, indicating non-complementation of thegdi1Δ null mutation and thus confirming the validity of this assay (Table I, single asterisk).Table IEffect of single point mutations in GDI on growth of the gdilΔ strainRegionLocationYeast residue mutatedGrowth at 30 °Ca++, wild-type; +, sick; and −, dead.Mammalian residueWild-type++SCR1A*a1 strandI13R−8SCR1Aa1loop AG16E++11SCR1Aa1 loopAG18E++13SCR1Ba2 loopf1Y44V++39B helixK59D++55Insert regionR78A++70SCR2e2 strandD109N++101SCR2b2 strandK126E++118SCR2D loopES137A++129G helixF192R++184SCR3B1 helixE241S++233SCR3B**I helixR248A+240SCR3Ba3 strandT256V++248SCR3B*a3 strandT256P−248b4 strandT322A++311a ++, wild-type; +, sick; and −, dead. Open table in a new tab We have previously shown that mutation of some of the highly conserved residues in SCRs 1B and 3B found at the apex of GDI affect the ability of the mutant GDIs to bind Rab3A in vitro (10Schalk I. Zeng K. Wu S.-K. Stura E.A. Matteson J. Huang M. Tandon A. Wilson I.A. Balch W.E. Nature. 1996; 381: 42-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). However, the physiological relevance of these observations remained to be determined. Two other SCRs (2 and 3A) contain conserved residues that are found on one face of GDI located beneath the Rab-binding region (10Schalk I. Zeng K. Wu S.-K. Stura E.A. Matteson J. Huang M. Tandon A. Wilson I.A. Balch W.E. Nature. 1996; 381: 42-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). Using the crystallographic structure and the aligned sequences of all GDIs and REPs comprising the GDI superfamily as a guide, point mutations changing conserved, surface-exposed amino acids of the various SCRs that were likely candidate residues for interactions with Rab or other molecules were constructed. Each was tested in the complementation assay. In addition, mutations were introduced to assess other structural features of Gdi1p. These included the GXG motif found at the base of the Rab-binding region that is potentially involved in the binding of a putative nucleotide cofactor. We also examined the importance of the carboxyl-terminal region containing helix N that supports the putative Rab-binding platform found at the apex of Gdi1p (10Schalk I. Zeng K. Wu S.-K. Stura E.A. Matteson J. Huang M. Tandon A. Wilson I.A. Balch W.E. Nature. 1996; 381: 42-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). The results of our initial analysis is shown in Table I. Despite the extensive collection of point mutants tested, no single amino acid change was found which resulted in a complete loss of Gdi1p function other than point mutations predicted to disrupt structure (Table I, single asterisk). Although we did not observe complete loss of cell growth for the single point mutants, one mutation, R248A (Table I, double asterisks), clearly affected Gdi1p function as evident by the slower growth of this strain. This particular residue was previously implicated as one of the most important amino acids required for Rab binding in vitro, reducing binding approximately 60-fold (10Schalk I. Zeng K. Wu S.-K. Stura E.A. Matteson J. Huang M. Tandon A. Wilson I.A. Balch W.E. Nature. 1996; 381: 42-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Because single point mutations of the homologous conserved residues in yeast Gdi1p did not result in lethal gdi1phenotypes, it is apparent that even the reduced level of Rab3A binding measured in vitro for equivalent mammalian GDI mutants (10Schalk I. Zeng K. Wu S.-K. Stura E.A. Matteson J. Huang M. Tandon A. Wilson I.A. Balch W.E. Nature. 1996; 381: 42-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) is sufficient to maintain adequate levels of Rab recycling in vivo for cell survival. These results now establish a working relationship between in vitro binding assays (that provide relative measure of GDI-Rab interaction) and the ability of GDI to recognize Rab under physiological conditions in vivo. Given the observation that reduced binding is not lethal, we suggest that the recycling activity of wild-type GDI is likely to be in functional excess in living cells. Because the R248A mutant resulted in a modest growth defect, this mutation was used as a starting point to construct a set of double mutants. Additional amino acid substitutions were made in either the same SCR containing R248 (SCR 3B) or in different SCRs, and each of these was tested in combination with R248A in the complementation assay (Table II). We also generated double mutants within and between SCRs that did not include the Arg248 residue to test whether multiple mutations in regions of Gdi1p flanking the putative Rab-binding platform would yield defective function. Three double mutant combinations did not complement the gdi1Δ mutation (Table II). One lethal construct was a triple mutant involving Arg248 and the residues GXG potentially involved in the binding of a cofactor to GDI (Table II, single asterisk) (10Schalk I. Zeng K. Wu S.-K. Stura E.A. Matteson J. Huang M. Tandon A. Wilson I.A. Balch W.E. Nature. 1996; 381: 42-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Significantly, two of the lethal double mutant combinations (Y44V,R248A and R248A,E241S) (Table II, double asterisks) contained residues (Tyr44 and Glu241) which when mutated separately, have been previously implicated in Rab-binding in vitro (10Schalk I. Zeng K. Wu S.-K. Stura E.A. Matteson J. Huang M. Tandon A. Wilson I.A. Balch W.E. Nature. 1996; 381: 42-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Thus, disruption of the physiological function of Gdi1p in vivo requires mutation of at least two surface residues in the putative Rab-binding region (10Schalk I. Zeng K. Wu S.-K. Stura E.A. Matteson J. Huang M. Tandon A. Wilson I.A. Balch W.E. Nature. 1996; 381: 42-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). All other double mutant combinations complemented thegdi1Δ mutation (Table II). Our results suggests that Rab interacts with GDI through multiple residues and demonstrates for the first time the physiological importance of the Rab-binding platform for the function of GDI in living cells.Table IIEffect of double mutants on growth of the gdi1Δ strainMutantGrowth at 30 °Ca++, wild-type; +, sick; −, dead.Wild-type++44–16A++44–59++44–241+44–248**−44–256V++16A-18A++16A-109++18A-109++126–137++241–256V++248–16A/18A*−248–109+248–78+248–241**−248–256V+a ++, wild-type; +, sick; −, dead. Open table in a new tab To further define the function of thegdi1 mutant genes, we examined whether selected mutants could complement the growth defect of sec19-1 cells. The function of the protein encoded by sec19-1 is temperature-sensitive resulting from a stop codon near the carboxyl-terminal end of helix N, leading to the production of a truncated protein whose folding is thought to be unstable at slightly elevated (semi-permissive) temperatures (30 °C). Complete loss of function is observed at 37 °C (28Collins R.N. Brennwald P. Garrett M. Lauring A. Novick P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18281-18289Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Consistent with this interpretation, further truncation resulting in the partial or complete removal of helix N leads to complete loss of function (data not shown). Each of the gdi1 mutant genes on CEN vectors was transformed into a sec19-1 strain (CBY47) and transformants were selected and maintained at 26 °C. Transformants were then restreaked and shifted to 37 °C for 3 days and the growth of each of the strains was assessed. Consistent with the above results, all singlegdi1 mutations suppressed the ts growth defect (Fig. 2A). In contrast, each of the double mutations that did not complement the gdi1Δ mutation also did not complement the sec19-1 mutation at 37 °C, in complete accord with the results of the gdi1Δ complementation test (Fig. 2A). Notably, when the R248A,Y44V and R248A,E241S double mutants were transformed into thesec19-1 strain, we observed significantly slower growth at 26 °C and a dramatic dominant growth defect at 30 °C (Fig. 2B), a semipermissive temperature for sec19-1.Interestingly, neither of the double mutants caused a growth defect when introduced into a wild-type strain, indicating that the double mutants exhibit an allele-specific genetic interaction withsec19-1. These results demonstrate that Gdi1p encoded bysec19-1 is likely to be weakly defective for function at both the permissive and semipermissive temperatures, and that this phenotype is clearly exacerbated by competition with a double mutant which fails to bind Rab (see below). Mutant gdi1alleles that failed to complement the gdi1Δ mutation or the sec19-1 ts phenotype could produce proteins that are defective for folding and therefore unstable and degraded. Alternatively, they could be deficient in any essential aspect of Gdi1p function, including Rab binding or interactions with membrane receptors possibly required for Rab delivery or extraction. To distinguish between these possibilities, a vector was constructed which allowed us to tag mutant and wild-type Gdi1p proteins with the influenza hemagglutinin (HA) epitope at the carboxyl terminus (HA-Gdi1p). This region in bovine GDI is disordered in the crystal structure (10Schalk I. Zeng K. Wu S.-K. Stura E.A. Matteson J. Huang M. Tandon A. Wilson I.A. Balch W.E. Nature. 1996; 381: 42-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) and the epitope tag would not be expected to interfere with Gdi1p function. Consistent with this conclusion, all HA-tagged constructs generated behaved in an identical fashion to their equivalent untagged versions. 2P. Luan, W. E. Balch, S. D. Emr, and C. G. Burd, unpublished observations. The double mutant genes and their corresponding single mutant genes cloned into the HA-vector were used to transform a sec19-1strain. Immunoblotting of total cell lysates derived from these strains with an HA-specific antibody revealed that a single band of approximately 52 kDa was present in the R248A,Y44A and R248A,E241S double mutants (Fig. 3A). All other mutant proteins tested, with one exception (see below Fig. 4A), were stable when expressed in vivo (Fig. 3A and data not shown).Figure 4Distribution of wild-type and mutant Gdi1 proteins between cytosol and membranes. A, strains (sec19-1) expressing the indicated HA epitope-tagged Gdi1 proteins were lysed and subjected to centrifugation at 100,000 ×g to generate a P100 membrane fraction and an S100 cytosol fraction. Gdi1p in each fraction was visualized after immunoblotting with the HA antibody. The vector only control is shown in lane g.

S100 fractions of thesec19-1 strain expressing vector only (control) (a and d), HA-tagged wild-type (b ande), or R248A,E241S (c and f) were isolated and incubated at 30 °C for 30 min with cell homogenates (a-c) or P100 membrane fractions (d-f) prepared from sec19-1 transformed with vector only. Subsequently, a P100 fraction of each incubation condition was isolated, washed, and probed with a HA-specific antibody using immunoblotting. C, in vitro binding of HA-GDI to membranes is trypsin-sensitive. A P100 membrane fraction prepared fromsec19-1 transformed with vector only was not treated (a and d), treated with trypsin premixed with a 2-fold molar excess of trypsin inhibitor (b ande) (1% weight/weight for 15 min on ice), or trypsin alone (c and f). In c and f, after trypsin digestion, a 2-fold molar excess amount of trypsin inhibitor was added. Subsequently, P100 samples were mixed with HA-Gdi1p (a-c) or the HA-tagged-R248A-E241S Gdi1p mutant as described in B and incubated at 30 °C for 30 min. A P100 fraction of each sample was isolated at the end of the incubation and probed with a HA-specific antibody using immunoblotting.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To determine if the stable double mutant Gdi1 proteins would bind Rabs, we used a native co-immunoprecipitation assay to examine their interaction with three different Rab GTPases that function at distinct steps of the secretory pathway: Ypt1p, required for ER/Golgi transport (29Segev N.

https://openalex.org/W2149603102,"The forkhead thyroid-specific transcription factor TTF-2 is the main mediator of thyrotropin and insulin regulation of thyroperoxidase (TPO) gene expression. This function depends on multimerization and specific orientation of its DNA-binding site, suggesting that TTF-2 is part of a complex interaction network within the TPO promoter. This was confirmed by transfection experiments and by protein-DNA interaction studies, which demonstrated that CTF/NF1 proteins bind 10 base pairs upstream of the TTF-2-binding site to enhance its action in hormone-induced expression of the TPO gene. GST pull-down assays showed that TTF-2 physically interacts with CTF/NF1 proteins. In addition, we demonstrate that increasing the distance between both transcription factors binding sites by base pair insertion results in loss of promoter activity and in a drastic decrease on the ability of the promoter to respond to the hormones. CTF/NF1 is a family of transcription factors that contributes to constitutive and cell-type specific gene expression. Originally identified as factors implicated in the replication of adenovirus, this group of proteins (CTF/NF1-A, -B, -C, and -X) is now known to be involved in the regulation of several genes. In contrast to other reports regarding the involvement of these proteins in inducible gene expression, we show here that members of this family of transcription factors are regulated by hormones. With the use of specific CTF/NF1 DNA probes and antibodies we demonstrate that CTF/NF1-C is a thyrotropin-, cAMP-, and insulin-inducible protein. Thus CTF/NF1 proteins do not only mediate hormone-induced gene expression cooperating with TTF-2, but are themselves hormonally regulated. All these findings are clearly of important value in understanding the mechanisms governing the transcription regulation of RNA polymerase II promoters, which often contain binding sites for multiple transcription factors.

All these findings are clearly of important value in understanding the mechanisms governing the transcription regulation of RNA polymerase II promoters, which often contain binding sites for multiple transcription factors. The mechanisms by which cells selectively activate the transcription of a specific gene are essential. Tissue-specific transcription factors that bind DNA sequences within the promoter are the main mediators of tissue-specific gene expression (1Mitchell P.J. Tjian R. Science. 1989; 245: 371-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (2206) Google Scholar). It has become clear, however, that transcriptional activation of a given gene is defined not only by the activity of an individual factor or a single DNA-binding site, but rather, depends on combinatorial interactions between multiple proteins (2Tjian R. Maniatis T. Cell. 1994; 77: 5-8Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (955) Google Scholar, 3Pugh B.F. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 303-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). To understand the mechanism of tissue-specific transcriptional activation, it is first necessary to identify cis-regulatory elements and to characterize tissue-specific transcription factors, and then to define protein-protein interaction that determine their function. The focus of our work has been to understand the regulatory mechanisms underlying hormonal transcription of the thyroperoxidase (TPO) 1The abbreviations used are: TPO, thyroperoxidase; TSH, thyrotropin; GST, glutathioneS-transferase; CAT, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase; bp, base pair(s); RSV, Rous sarcoma virus; kb, kilobase(s); EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; MMTV, mouse mammary tumor virus; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; TTF-2, thyroid-specific transcription factor 2; UFB, ubiquitious factor B. gene, a tissue-specific enzyme expressed only in differentiated thyroid cells. Its function involves the iodination and coupling of tyrosine residues into the thyroglobulin molecule to generate thyroid hormones (4De Groot L.J. Niepomniszce H.

Both thyroglobulin and TPO are cell type-specific genes whose respective promoters have been characterized (7Civitareale D. Lonigro R. Sinclair A. Di Lauro R. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 2537-2542Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar, 8Francis-Lang H. Price M. Polycarpou-Schwarz M. Di Lauro R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 576-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). With the use of DNA binding assay, three thyroid-specific transcription factors have been identified: TTF-1, TTF-2, and Pax-8 (9Damante G. Di Lauro R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1218: 255-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Cloning of these three proteins demonstrated that they are members of different transcription factor families. TTF-1 and Pax-8 are homeo- and paired-containing proteins, respectively (10Guazzi S. Price M. De Felice M. Damante G. Mattei M.-G. Di Lauro R. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3631-3639Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar, 11Plachov D. Chowdhurand K. Walther C. Simon D. Guenet J.L. Gruss P. Development. 1990; 110: 643-651Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and TTF-2 is a forkhead protein (12Zannini M. Avantaggiato V. Biffali E. Arnone M.I. Sato K. Pischetola M. Taylor B.A. Phillips S.J. Simeone A. Di Lauro R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3185-3197Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). The three factors are expressed at the beginning of thyroid development (11Plachov D. Chowdhurand K.

Development. 1991; 113: 1093-1104Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and are considered decisive in the maintenance of thyroid phenotype. All of them bind within the thyroglobulin and TPO promoter at similar positions (7Civitareale D. Lonigro R. Sinclair A. Di Lauro R. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 2537-2542Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar, 8Francis-Lang H. Price M. Polycarpou-Schwarz M. Di Lauro R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 576-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 14Zannini M. Francis-Lang H. Plachov D. Di Lauro R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4230-4241Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar) although the TPO promoter differs in several aspects from that of thyroglobulin. It is thus approximately an order of magnitude less active than the thyroglobulin promoter; the Pax-8 protein overlapping the TTF-1-binding site has a different position (14Zannini M. Francis-Lang H. Plachov D. Di Lauro R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4230-4241Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar) and the ubiquitous transcription factors that bind to both promoters occupy different sites in each one (7Civitareale D. Lonigro R. Sinclair A. Di Lauro R. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 2537-2542Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar, 8Francis-Lang H. Price M. Polycarpou-Schwarz M. Di Lauro R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 576-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Several ligands regulate the expression of the TPO gene through alteration of the activity of the transcription factors that control its expression. For example, we have recently demonstrated that the transcription factor TTF-2 is under the hormonal control of the thyrotropin (TSH) and the cAMP as well as to the insulin and insulin-like growth factor I signaling pathways (15Ortiz L. Zannini M. Di Lauro R. Santisteban P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23334-23339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). TTF-2 binds to a single site that acts as a hormone response element. This function depends on multimerization and specific orientation of the TTF-2-binding site (16Aza-Blanc P. Di Lauro R. Santisteban P. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 1297-1306PubMed Google Scholar). This suggests that TTF-2 is part of a complex interaction network within the TPO promoter, whose final result is to turn-on the specific expression of the TPO gene in response to external hormonal stimuli. As the binding site for TTF-2 functions in an orientation-specific manner, we asked whether TTF-2 alone regulates the expression of this gene or requires the action of neighboring sequences. Neighboring regulatory elements of TTF-2 bind the thyroid-specific transcription factor TTF-1 and the ubiquitous transcription factor UFB (8Francis-Lang H. Price M. Polycarpou-Schwarz M. Di Lauro R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 576-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Here we show by transient transfection assays and site-directed mutagenesis that the binding sites for TTF-2 and UFB are important for hormone-induced expression at the TPO promoter. Furthermore, we show that UFB is a binding site for members of the CTF/NF1 family of transcription factors. These are a multiprotein family in which four different genes have been cloned, NF1-A, NF1-B, NF1-C, and NF1-X (17Santoro C. Mermod N. Andrews P.C. Tjian R.

Nature. 1988; 334: 218-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar, 20Kruse U. Sippel A.E. FEBS Lett. 1994; 348: 46-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 21Nebl G. Cato A.C.B. Cell. Mol.

Although their expression is fully ubiquitous, differences can be detected in the distribution and abundance of their different transcripts (23Paonessa G. Gounari F. Frank R. Cortese R. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 3115-3123Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 24Chaudhry A.Z. Lyons G.E. Gronostajski R.M. Dev. Dyn. 1997; 208: 313-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Strikingly, we have found that, as occurs for TTF-2 (15Ortiz L. Zannini M. Di Lauro R. Santisteban P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23334-23339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), CTF/NF1 gene expression is up-regulated by TSH and insulin in inducing the expression of the TPO gene. Furthermore, we present evidence, from a GST pull-down assay, that these constitutive factors interact physically with TTF-2. This interaction appears to be functional, since the TPO promoter activity and its hormonal response are lost in transfection experiments in which the distance between the CTF/NF1 and TTF-2-binding site has been altered. Thus the hormonal control of TPO gene transcription, which takes place exclusively in thyroid-differentiated cells, depends on the correct stereospecific interaction of two hormonally expressed transcription factors: TTF-2 and CTF/NF1. Tissue culture medium, bovine TSH, and bovine insulin were purchased from Sigma, and forskolin from Roche Molecular Biochemicals (Mannheim, Germany). Donor, fetal calf serum, and Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium were from Life Technologies, Inc. (Gaithersburg, MD); Nytran membranes were obtained from Schleicher & Schüll (Richmond, CA). TnT and luciferase assay kits were purchased from Promega (Madison, WI). [α-32P]dCTP, [γ-32P]ATP, and [35S]methionine were from ICN (Irvine, CA). FRTL-5 cells (ATTC CRL 8305; American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) were cultured as described previously (25Ambesi-Impiombato F.S. Parks L.A.M. Coon H.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The effect of TSH and insulin were studied by starving confluent or transfected cells for both hormones in the presence of 0.2% serum (basal medium) (26Santisteban P. Kohn L.D. Di Lauro R. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 4048-4052Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After 4 days, each ligand was added to the culture medium at the concentrations given. HeLa cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. For transient expression assays, transfections were performed by the calcium phosphate coprecipitation method, as described for each cell line (16Aza-Blanc P. Di Lauro R. Santisteban P. Mol.

The deletions p120 and p92 TPOLUC, as well as insertions p120(+5) and p120(+10), were generated by the polymerase chain reaction on the p420 TPO LUC template, using as flanking primers the 3′ polymerase chain reaction primer LUC-1: 5′-GGATAGAATGGCGCCGGGCCTTTCTTTATG-3′ and the following oligonucleotides as 5′ polymerase chain reaction primers: TPO-120, 5′-AAGAGCTCATACTAAACAAACAG-3′; TPO-92, 5′-AAGAGCTCGACACACAAGCACTTGGCAG-3′; TPO-120 (+5), 5′-AAGAGCTGACACACAAGCACTTGGCAGAAACGGATCAAATACTAAAC-3′; and TPO-120 (+10), 5′- AAGAGCTGACACACAAGCACTTGGCAGAAACGGATCCGACGAAATACTAAAC-3′. Amplified fragments were digested with SacI andPstI and subcloned into pBS LUC-2 (8Francis-Lang H. Price M. Polycarpou-Schwarz M. Di Lauro R. Mol. Cell.

Di Lauro R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 576-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). In the pBmm mutant the TTGG sequence is altered to GGTC and TTF-1 and UFB binding activity is thus undetectable. pZm contains a 4-bp mutation within the Z site, which interferes with TTF-2 binding. Constructs containing tandem repeats of Z site (−93 to −73) in front of the minimal promoter TATA LUC have been described elsewhere (16Aza-Blanc P. Di Lauro R. Santisteban P. Mol.

Hybridizations were carried out at 65 °C in 4 × SSC (1 × SSC is 0.15 m NaCl, 0.125 m sodium citrate), 10 mm EDTA, and 0.05% SDS. After hybridization, the filters were washed at 65 °C for 30 min each in 3.3% phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, 0.1% SDS and successively lower salt concentrations (2, 1, and 0.5 × SSC) before autoradiography. For electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA), the nuclear protein fraction was extracted by the procedure described by Andrews and Faller (37Andrews N.C. Faller D.V.

DNase I footprinting reactions were carried out in a 50-μl reaction volume as follows: recombinant NF-1 (5 or 25 ng) was preincubated with 5 × 104 cpm for 45 min on ice in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 50 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, and 0.4 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. DNase I digestion was performed by the addition of 6 ng of DNase I in 10 mmMgCl2, 2 mm CaCl2 and incubation for 1 min at room temperature. Footprinting reactions were terminated by addition of 200 μl of a stop mixture (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 m NaCl, 20 mm EDTA, 0.5% SDS, and 250 μg/ml proteinase K). The samples were incubated for 1 h at 45 °C, extracted with phenol-chloroform, ethanol precipitated, and resuspended in formamide dye. Equal number of counts per sample were loaded and resolved on an 8% sequencing gel, together with G and G + A chemical sequencing reactions. Gels were fixed, dried, and visualized by autoradiography. EMSA were carried out as described previously (39Santisteban P. Acebr—n A. Polycarpou-Schwarz M. Di Lauro R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 1310-1317Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) using 32P-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotide UFB (5′-CAAGCACTTGGCAGAAACAAATAC-3′) or consensus NF-1 (5′-CATATTGGCTTCAATCCAAA-3′) derived from the MMTV promoter (40Jones K.A. Kadonaga J.T. Rosenfeld P.J. Kelland T.J. Tjian R. Cell. 1987; 48: 79-89Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar). For supershift experiments, 1 μl of anti-NF-1/8199/2902 (kindly provided by Dr. N. Tanese, New York University, New York) or preimmune serums were added to the preincubation mixture. An overnight culture of the bacterial strand BL21 cells harboring plasmid pGEX-4T3 or pGEX-TTF-2 was diluted 1:10 in a 2 × YT medium plus ampicillin, pH 7.0, and cultured at 27 °C to optical density at 600 nm of 0.6–0.75. Protein expression was then induced by adding 0.1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside and cultures were incubated for an additional 2 h at the same temperature. Cells were harvested and the fusion proteins purified as described (41Gupta M.P. Amin C.S. Gupta M. Hay N. Zak R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3924-3936Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The integrity of the GST fusion proteins bound to the beads was analyzed by resolution by 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and Coomassie Blue staining. Known amounts of bovine serum albumin were included on the same gel for determination of the yield. For in vitro translation in reticulocyte lysate, we used a coupled transcription/translation system (TnT, Promega) in the presence of [35S]methionine (1000 mCi/mmol). The protocol for the GST pull-down assay was essentially as described (42Zeiner M. Gehring U. Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11465-11469Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). GST or GST-TTF-2 proteins (5 μg) immobilized on glutahione-Sepharose 4B beads were washed extensively with LBST-100 buffer (25 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.9, 100 mm NaCl, 6% glycerol, 5 mm MgCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.05% Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 mm EDTA) and the volume was raised to 180 μl with LBST-100 buffer. Radioactively labeled protein (20 μl) was then added and gently mixed at room temperature for 30 min, followed by a further 30-min incubation with gentle shaking at 4 °C. The beads were washed four times with successively increasing NaCl concentrations (LBST-100, LBST-300, and LBST-500), and the bound proteins were analyzed in 8% SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography. Previous results from our laboratory have demonstrated that TPO promoter activity is hormonally regulated by TSH through the cAMP pathway, as well as by insulin and insulin-like growth factor I. This regulation is mediated mainly by the cis-regulatory element (Z) to which the forkhead thyroid transcription factor-2 (TTF-2) binds (see Fig. 1A,for cartoon). Further analysis showed that the TTF-2-binding site acts as a hormone response element in a heterologous construct and that it requires a specific orientation for activation of the TPO promoter (16Aza-Blanc P. Di Lauro R. Santisteban P. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 1297-1306PubMed Google Scholar). This suggests that TTF-2 may require other bound factors for activation of TPO expression gene. To identify the regulatory elements on the TPO promoter that cooperate with the TTF-2-binding site, we transfected into FRTL-5 thyroid cells different promoter constructs of this gene (Fig. 1, upper panels) linked to the coding region of the firefly luciferase gene (30De Wet J.R. Wood K.V. Deluca M. Helsinki D.R. Subramani S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 725-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (2480) Google Scholar). The transfected cells were cultured for 72 h in a minimal medium depleted of TSH and insulin but supplemented with 0.2% serum to ensure only a basal expression of the TPO (16Aza-Blanc P. Di Lauro R. Santisteban P. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 1297-1306PubMed Google Scholar, 43Isozaki O. Kohn L.D. Kozak C.A. Kimura S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1989; 3: 1681-1692Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). TPO promoter activity was enhanced by treatment of the cells with TSH or insulin for 24 h. The promoter activity was determined by luciferase activity measurements while CAT activity derived from a co-transfected RSV-CAT construct was used to correct for variability in transfection efficiency. In this transfection assay, only the p420 TPO LUC and p120 TPO LUC constructs showed hormone inducibility (Fig. 1A, lower panel). Neither p92 TPO-LUC nor p60 TPO-LUC, in which successive deletions were performed of the B and Z site, respectively, responded to TSH and insulin treatment. As both inducers enhanced the promoter activity of construct p120 but not p92 TPO LUC, the B element missing in the p92 construct must be important for the hormone response. The B element has been previously reported to bind the transcription factors TTF-1 and UBF. Mutations introduced into both binding sites (pBmm) that abolished binding by their respective factors (8Francis-Lang H. Price M. Polycarpou-Schwarz M. Di Lauro R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 576-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar) drastically reduced hormone regulation of expression at the TPO promoter (Fig. 1B). Mutations in the Z regulatory element destroying the binding of TTF-2 (pZm) also abrogated hormone inducibility (Fig. 1B) indicating a concerted action of the B and Z regulatory sites for hormone inducibility. The fact that the multimerization of the Z element confers hormone inducibility to the minimal promoter TATA LUC and a single Z element was unable (Fig. 1C) implies that the hormone regulatory activity of the Z element comes from cooperative action with itself or possibly with other transcription factor. To find out whether the B regulatory element can confer hormone inducibility to a single Z element, we cloned the B and Z regulatory units in front of the minimal promoter. This construct in the transfection experiments produced an identical result as p4xZ in its response to hormone treatment. We therefore concluded that the hormonal response of the TPO promoter activity is dependent on an active cooperation between TTF-2 and the factors binding to the B site. It is important to mention that in the above study the TSH effect was mimicked by forskolin (data not shown). Analyses of the BZ region (−120 to −73) of the TPO promoter by in vitrofootprinting with nuclear extracts from FRTL-5 thyroid and non-thyroid Rat-1 cells had identified three different transcription factors that bind to this sequence (8Francis-Lang H. Price M. Polycarpou-Schwarz M. Di Lauro R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 576-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Two of these are thyroid-specific and were identified as TTF-1 and TTF-2, ho"

D., Shapiro, R., Irons, L. I., Russo, N., and Acharya, K. R. (1997) Biochemistry 36, 5578–5588) was used to design new inhibitors that extend into unoccupied regions of the enzyme active site. These compounds are dinucleotides that contain an unusual 3′,5′-pyrophosphate linkage and were synthesized in solution by a combined chemical and enzymatic procedure. The most potent of them, 5′-phospho-2′-deoxyuridine 3′-pyrophosphate, P′ → 5′-ester with adenosine 3′-phosphate (pdUppAp), binds to RNase A withK i values of 27 and 220 nm at pH 5.9 and 7, respectively. These values are 6–9-fold lower than those for ppAp and 50-fold lower than that for the transition state analogue, uridine vanadate. pdUppAp has broad specificity; it is an effective inhibitor of at least two other members of the pancreatic RNase superfamily, human RNase-2 (eosinophil-derived neurotoxin) and RNase-4, which share only 36–44% sequence identity with the pancreatic enzyme. The potency of pdUppAp and the other inhibitors described here depends critically on the extended internucleotide linkage; the pyrophosphate group enhances dinucleotide binding to the three RNases by 2.1–2.9 orders of magnitude, as compared with a monophosphate. These data give further insight into the organization of the catalytic centers of the various RNases. Moreover, the new class of inhibitors provides a useful means by which to probe the biological actions of these and other related enzymes.

Moreover, the new class of inhibitors provides a useful means by which to probe the biological actions of these and other related enzymes. Proteins in the mammalian pancreatic RNase superfamily are noncytosolic endonucleases that degrade RNA through a two-step transphosphorolytic-hydrolytic reaction (1Richards F.M. Wyckoff H.W.

Some of these enzymes appear to play a purely digestive role, whereas others exhibit potent and unusual biological activities (3D'Alessio G.

Key M.E. Vallee B.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 442-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Two other RNases, eosinophil-derived neurotoxin (also known as RNase-2, RNase Us, and liver RNase) and eosinophil cationic protein, are neurotoxic and may produce some of the symptoms of diseases associated with overproduction of eosinophils (9Gleich G.J.

Bovine seminal RNase is endowed with antitumor, immunosuppressive, and antispermatogenic activities (10D' Alessio G. Di Donato A. Parente A. Piccoli R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 104-106Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Abolition of the ribonucleolytic activities of these enzymes by mutagenesis or chemical modification also eliminates biological activity (10D' Alessio G. Di Donato A. Parente A. Piccoli R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 104-106Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 11Shapiro R. Fox E.A. Riordan J.F.

This implies that inhibitors targeted to the active site might suppress the biological actions of these proteins and hence be useful for treatment of human diseases and for mechanistic studies. Our initial efforts to design potent low molecular weight inhibitors of the biologically active RNases have focused on bovine pancreatic RNase A (14Russo N. Shapiro R. Vallee B.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 231: 671-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 15Leonidas D.D. Shapiro R. Irons L.I. Russo N. Acharya K.R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 5578-5588Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) as a convenient model system. The ribonucleolytic center of RNase A is constituted by multiple subsites that bind the phosphate, base, and ribose components of its RNA substrate (1Richards F.M. Wyckoff H.W. Boyer P.D. 3rd Ed. The Enzymes. 4. Academic Press, Inc., New York1971: 647-806Google Scholar, 16Nogués M.V. Vilanova M. Cuchillo C.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1253: 16-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). The most important of these are: (i) the P1 site, where cleavage of the phosphodiester bond occurs, (ii) the B1 site for binding the base whose ribose donates its 3′ oxygen to the P1 phosphate, (iii) the B2 site, which binds the base whose ribose donates its 5′ oxygen to the P1 phosphate, (iv) the P0 site, which binds the 5′-phosphate of the B1 nucleotide, and (v) the P2 site, which binds the 3′-phosphate of the B2 nucleotide. The B1 site has a virtually absolute specificity for pyrimidines. The B2 site can bind all bases but strongly prefers purines. The most effective small molecule inhibitor of RNase A identified previously is 5′-diphosphoadenosine 3′-phosphate (ppAp), 1The abbreviations used are: ppAp, 5′-diphosphoadenosine 3′-phosphate; Tp, thymidine 3′-phosphate; dUp, 2′-deoxyuridine 3′-phosphate; TpdA, thymidylyl-(3′ → 5′)-2′-deoxyadenosine; UVan, uridine vanadate; FAB, fast atom bombardment; HRMS, high resolution mass spectrometry; UppAp, uridine 3′-pyrophosphate, P′ → 5′-ester with adenosine 3′-phosphate; dUppAp, 2′-deoxyuridine 3′-pyrophosphate, P′ → 5′-ester with adenosine 3′-phosphate; U2′ppAp, uridine 2′-pyrophosphate, P′ → 5′-ester with adenosine 3′-phosphate; pdUppAp, 5′-phospho-2′-deoxyuridine 3′-pyrophosphate, P′ → 5′-ester with adenosine 3′-phosphate; pTppAp, 5′-phosphothymidine 3′-pyrophosphate, P′ → 5′-ester with adenosine 3′-phosphate; TppdA, thymidine 3′-pyro-phosphate, P′ → 5′-ester with 2′-deoxyadenosine; Mes, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography. withK i values of 0.24 and 1.3 μm at pH 5.9 and 7.0, respectively (14Russo N. Shapiro R. Vallee B.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 231: 671-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of the RNase A·ppAp complex (15Leonidas D.D. Shapiro R. Irons L.I. Russo N. Acharya K.R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 5578-5588Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) has revealed that the inhibitor binds to the P1-B2-P2 region of the active site in a manner strikingly different from that expected on the basis of earlier structures of RNase complexes (Fig. 2). Specifically, the 5′-β-phosphate of the inhibitor, rather than the 5′-α-phosphate, is positioned at P1, where it forms H bonds with the main chain N of Phe-120 and the side chains of the catalytic residues His-12, Lys-41, and His-119. The 5′-α-phosphate H bonds to the side chains of Gln-11 in P1 and Lys-7 in P2. The adenine moiety of ppAp, in contrast to that of other RNase A inhibitors, adopts asyn conformation; despite the ∼180 ° rotation of the ring, it still makes extensive interactions with the amino acids that normally constitute B2 (H bonds with Asn-71, Gln-69, and Asn-67; van der Waals contacts with these residues plus Cys-65, Ala-109, Glu-111, and Val-118; and stacking with the imidazole of His-119). Finally, the 3′-phosphate H bonds with Lys-7. The present report describes the use of this structural information for the design of derivatives of ppAp that are extended into the B1 and P0 sites of RNase A. The most potent of the new inhibitors, 5′-phospho-2′-deoxyuridine 3′-pyrophosphate, P′ → 5′-ester with adenosine 3′-phosphate (pdUppAp), and 5′-phosphothymidine 3′-pyrophosphate, P′ → 5′-ester with adenosine 3′-phosphate (pTppAp), bind to RNase A with K i values of 27 and 41 nm, respectively, at pH 5.9. Importantly, these compounds are stable and have broad specificity for members of the mammalian RNase superfamily that share only 36–44% overall sequence identity with RNase A. The tight binding of the new class of inhibitor to all of the RNases is largely due to the unusual 3′,5′-pyrophosphate linkage between the two nucleotide components. RNase substrates, thymidine 3′-phosphate (Tp), 2′-deoxyuridine 3′-phosphate (dUp), ATP, thymidylyl-(3′ → 5′)-2′-deoxyadenosine (TpdA), RNase T2 from Aspergillus oryzae, and nucleotide pyrophosphatase from Crotalus adamanteus venom were obtained from Sigma. RNase A and nuclease-free bovine serum albumin were purchased from Worthington. Fetal bovine serum was from Life Technologies, Inc. Human RNase-4 was purified from HT-29 adenocarcinoma cells as described (17Shapiro R. Fett J.W. Strydom D.J. Vallee B.L. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 7255-7264Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Concentrations of RNase A preparations were determined spectrophotometrically (ε278 = 9800m−1 cm−1; Ref. 18Sela M. Anfinsen C.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1957; 24: 229-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar), and those of RNases-2 and -4 were determined by amino acid analysis. Mass spectrometry was performed by the Department of Chemistry and Chemical Biology at Harvard University. Modeling was performed with the program QUANTA (Molecular Simulations) implemented on a Silicon Graphics Indy workstation. Superposition of the RNase A·ppAp (Protein Data Bank code 1AFK, molecule I of the asymmetric unit) and RNase A·uridine vanadate (UVan; Protein Data Bank code 6RSA) complexes was achieved by aligning the α-carbons of Thr-45, Phe-120, and Ser-123 in the two structures. Reconfiguration of the uridine ribose to 2′- and 3′-endo conformations was based on the atomic coordinates of the thymidine and cytidine in the complexes of RNase A with d(ApTpApA) (Protein Data Bank code 1RCN) and cytidine 2′-phosphate (Protein Data Bank code 1ROB), respectively. Superposition of the RNase A·pdUppAp model and the crystal structure of human RNase-2 was performed by aligning the α-carbons of Gln-11/14, His-12/15, Lys-41/38, Thr-45/42, Asn-71/70, and His-119/129. A mixture of 2′,5′- and 3′,5′-ADP (morpholinium salt; 0.24 mmol total) was reacted with dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (2.4 mmol) and morpholine (1.92 mmol) in 10 ml of 70% t-butyl alcohol and 30% water (v/v) to yield adenosine 2′,3′-cyclic phosphate 5′-phosphomorpholidate,bis-(4-morpholineN,N′-dicyclohexylcarboxamidinium) salt (19Moffat J.G. Khorana H.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1961; 83: 663-675Crossref Scopus (114) Google Scholar). 50 μmol of the morpholidate were then dried by five coevaporations with anhydrous pyridine and reconstituted in 2 ml of pyridine. Separately, 75 μmol of the sodium salt of dUp were converted to the tri-n-butylammonium salt by passage through a 0.7 × 1.5-cm column of SP-Sepharose resin that had been treated with 0.5m tri-n-butylammonium acetate and then washed with water. This material was lyophilized and then dried by five coevaporations with pyridine, redissolved in 2 ml of pyridine, and added to the morpholidate. After 24 h of incubation at room temperature, the solvent was evaporated, and residual pyridine was removed by three coevaporations with water. The sample was then dissolved in 6 ml of 60 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), containing 60 units of RNase T2, an enzyme that catalyzes the hydrolysis of nucleoside and oligonucleotide 2′,3′-cyclic phosphates specifically to the 3′-phosphate (20Sato S. Uchida T. Egami F. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1966; 115: 48-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). After 24 h of incubation at 37 °C, the reaction mixture was loaded onto a QAE-Sepharose column (1.5 × 10 cm) that had been equilibrated with 0.1 m triethylammonium bicarbonate (pH 7.3), and a 6-h linear gradient from 0.1 to 0.4m triethylammonium bicarbonate was applied at a flow rate of 1.5 ml/min. The main peak of absorbance at 280 nm was diluted with 2 volumes of water and lyophilized, and residual triethylammonium bicarbonate was removed by three coevaporations with methanol. The sample was then dissolved in 1 ml of methanol and precipitated by the addition of 10 ml of dry ether. The precipitate was collected by centrifugation, residual ether was evaporated, and the sample was finally reconstituted in water. Fast atom bombardment (FAB) high resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) yielded an [M − H]− value of 716.0520 versus the calculated value of 716.0519 for C19H26N7O17P3. U2′ppAp was prepared by the same procedure described for dUppAp, except that uridine 2′-phosphate was substituted for dUp in the second chemical reaction. [M − H]−calculated for C19H26N7O18P3was 732.0468, and the value found by HRMS was 732.0469. pdUppAp was prepared by incubating dUppAp (∼30 μmol) with 360 units of T4 polynucleotide kinase (Promega) in 18 ml of 80 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 10 mmMgCl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 9 mmATP at 37 °C for 24 h. The final product was purified by anion exchange chromatography as for dUppAp, except that the gradient was from 0.25–0.5 m triethylammonium bicarbonate. [M − H]− calculated for C19H27N7O20P4was 796.0182, and the value found by HRMS was 796.0184. pTppAp was prepared as for pdUppAp, except that Tp was substituted for dUp. [M − H]− calculated for C20H29N7O20P4was 810.0339, and the value found by HRMS was 810.0340. TppdA was prepared by reacting 100 μmol of 2′-deoxyadenosine 5′-phosphomorpholidate (Sigma) with 120 μmol of Tp (tri-n-butylammonium salt) in 3 ml of dry pyridine for 24 h at room temperature. The product was purified on QAE-Sepharose as for dUppAp, except that a gradient from 0.05–0.2m triethylammonium bicarbonate was used. [M − H]− calculated for C20H27N7O13P2was 634.1064, and the value found by HRMS was 634.1063. Purity was assessed by chromatography on a Mono Q column (HR5/5; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) with a 25-min linear gradient from 25–400 mm NaCl in Tris-Cl (pH 8) at a flow rate of 1.2 ml/min, recording the absorbance at 254 nm. Concentrations of inhibitor solutions were determined spectrophotometrically, using ε260 values of 25,000 m−1cm−1 for dUppAp, U2′ppAp, and pdUppAp, and 23,400m−1 cm−1 for TppdA and pTppAp, all of which were calculated from the values for mononucleotides listed by Beaven et al. (21Beaven G.H. Holiday E.R. Johnson E.A. Chargaff E. Davidson J.N. The Nucleic Acids. 1. Academic Press, New York1955: 493-553Google Scholar). Nucleotide pyrophosphatase digestions were conducted in 50 μl of 50 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, containing 0.5 mm dinucleotide and 0.04 units of enzyme, at 25 °C for 1 h. The chemical stability of each pyrophosphate-linked nucleotide was examined by performing Mono Q chromatography (as above) on a 25-nmol aliquot that had been incubated in 50 μl of 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.0) at 25 °C for 3 days. The stability of pTppAp in the presence of serum was examined by analyzing in the same manner an 80-nmol aliquot that had been incubated in 40 μl of 10 mm Tris-Cl (pH 8.0) containing 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C for 48 h. RNase contamination of the final preparations was assessed by incubating aliquots of each dinucleotide (15 nmol) in 30 μl of 0.2 m Mes (pH 5.9), containing 0.25 mm cytidylyl-(3′ → 5′)-adenosine and 0.25 mmadenylyl-(3′ → 5′)-adenosine for 20 h at 25 °C and then using C18 HPLC to measure any adenosine released (22Russo N.

Human RNase-2 was purified from urine by a modification of the method used for isolation from placenta (23Shapiro R. Vallee B.L. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 2246-2255Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). All operations were performed at 4 °C unless specified otherwise. Urine (1 liter) was diluted 8-fold with water and drawn through a 400-ml filter cake of CM-52 cation exchange resin (Whatman) in a 9.4-cm diameter sintered glass funnel under vacuum at a flow rate of 2.5 liters/h. The resin was then washed with 2 liters of 20 mm disodium phosphate (pH 6.6) and transferred into a 2.5-cm diameter column. Additional phosphate buffer was passed through the column until the absorbance of the effluent at 280 nm was <0.05, and the column was then eluted with 1 m NaCl in the same buffer. Salt-eluted material was concentrated to <10 ml by ultrafiltration in an Amicon device equipped with a YM3 membrane, diluted 10-fold with 20 mm sodium acetate (pH 5.5), reconcentrated, and centrifuged at 15,600 ×g for 15 min. The supernatant was then loaded onto a Mono S cation exchange column that had been equilibrated with 20 mm sodium acetate (pH 5.5). Elution was achieved with a 50-min linear gradient from 0 to 0.4 m NaCl in 20 mm sodium acetate (pH 5.5) at 0.8 ml/min at ambient temperature. RNase-2 eluted at 44 min. The amino acid composition of this material was indistinguishable from that expected from the sequence (24Beintema J.J. Hofsteenge J. Iwama M. Morita T. Ohgi K. Irie M. Sugiyama R.H. Schieven G.L.

The absence of any significant contamination by pancreatic RNase was established by spectrophotometric assay (25Witzel H. Barnard E.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1962; 7: 295-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The RNase-2 preparation cleaved CpA >500-fold more rapidly than CpG; this preference is similar to that reported previously and is 25-fold larger than that for the pancreatic enzyme (23Shapiro R. Vallee B.L. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 2246-2255Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 26Sorrentino S. Libonati M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 312: 340-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Inhibition of RNase A by all compounds except for TpdA was assessed with a spectrophotometric method (25Witzel H. Barnard E.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1962; 7: 295-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) as described previously (14Russo N. Shapiro R. Vallee B.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 231: 671-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Assays were performed in 0.2 m Mes (pH 5.9) or 0.2m Hepes (pH 7.0), containing 10 μg/ml bovine serum albumin at 25 °C with 1.3–10 nm enzyme and the substrate cytidylyl-(3′ → 5′)-guanosine at a concentration (75 μm) well below K m. TheK i values reported represent the −[I] intercepts of plots of [E]/v 0 versus [I], where v 0 is the initial reaction velocity and [E] and [I] are the concentrations of enzyme and inhibitor, respectively. Values of K i for RNase-2 and RNase-4 with pyrophosphate-linked nucleotides were determined by the same procedure, except that the substrates were cytidylyl-(3′ → 5′)-adenosine (75 μm) and uridylyl-(3′ → 5′)-adenosine (55 μm), respectively, and the enzyme concentrations were 4–12 nm. The high concentrations of TpdA required to produce significant inhibition of the three enzymes precluded the use of the spectrophotometric assay to measure reaction velocities, and inhibition was assessed by using an HPLC method (17Shapiro R. Fett J.W. Strydom D.J. Vallee B.L. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 7255-7264Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 22Russo N. Shapiro R. Acharya K.R. Riordan J.F. Vallee B.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2920-2924Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) to determine the dependence of k cat /K mvalues on [I]. Reaction conditions were as above, except that the concentration of bovine serum albumin was 50 μg/ml, the substrate for RNase-2 was uridylyl-(3′ → 5′)-cytidine (100 μm), and the concentrations of RNase A, RNase-2, and RNase-4 were 0.7, 1–2, and 50 nm, respectively. Values of K irepresent the −[I] intercepts of plots ofK m/k cat versus[I]. The crystal structure of the RNase A·ppAp complex (15Leonidas D.D. Shapiro R. Irons L.I. Russo N. Acharya K.R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 5578-5588Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) reveals that the B1 pyrimidine-binding site, a cleft formed by the side chains of Val-43, Asn-44, Thr-45, Phe-120, and Ser-123, is unoccupied. Therefore, molecular modeling was used to explore how a pyrimidine moiety could be linked to ppAp so that it would interact with this site. Uracil was selected as the base because RNase-4, one of the targets for the inhibitors under development (see below), strongly prefers this pyrimidine over cytosine (17Shapiro R. Fett J.W. Strydom D.J. Vallee B.L. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 7255-7264Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), and most of the other mammalian RNases bind uridine and cytidine nucleotides with similar affinity (1Richards F.M. Wyckoff H.W. Boyer P.D. 3rd Ed. The Enzymes. 4. Academic Press, Inc., New York1971: 647-806Google Scholar, 23Shapiro R. Vallee B.L. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 2246-2255Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 27Iwama M. Kunihiro M. Ohgi K. Irie M. J. Biochem. (T okyo). 1981; 89: 1005-1016PubMed Google Scholar). Modeling was begun by superimposing the B1 regions of the structures of the RNase A·ppAp and RNase A·UVan (28Borah B. Chen C. Egan W. Miller M. Wlodawer A. Cohen J.S. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 2058-2067Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar) complexes. The positions of Thr-45, Phe-120, and Ser-123 for the two RNases in the superposition are quite similar, with deviations of <0.11 Å and 0.16–0.51 Å for α-carbons and side chain atoms, respectively. All three of these residues in the ppAp complex are oriented such that they would be able to form the same interactions with uracil as in the UVan complex, i.e. H bonds with OG1 and NH of Thr-45, van der Waals contacts with the phenyl ring of Phe-120, and a water-mediated H bond with OG of Ser-123. The other active site components also aligned well (the root mean square deviation for the positions of the α-carbons of Lys-7, His-12, Lys-41, Asn-67, Gln-69, Asn-71, and His-119 in the two structures was 0.5 Å), suggesting that occupation of the B1 site will not perturb the interactions with ppAp. The next modeling step was to remove the vanadium atom, vanadate atoms O1V, O2V, and O3V, and the RNase molecule of the RNase A·UVan complex, leaving a single RNase molecule with ppAp bound to its P1-B2-P2 region and uridine positioned at the B1 site (Fig. 3A). In this model, the 2′- and 3′-oxygens of uridine are 1.0 and 0.9 Å from the ppAp β-phosphate atoms O2B and O3B, respectively, indicating that only a relatively minor adjustment would be required to connect the uridine ribose with the phosphate. Because the puckering of the UVan-derived ribose is atypical, we explored the effects of altering this conformation to those more commonly found in complexes of RNase A with pyrimidine nucleotides. Reconfiguration to C2′-endo followed by rotation of the β-phosphate by 80 ° produced an excellent alignment of O3′ and O3B (Fig. 3B). Reconfiguration to C3′-endo followed by a 20 ° rotation of the phosphate in the opposite direction placed O2′ in nearly perfect alignment with O2B (Fig. 3C). These observations suggested that a uridine attached through its 2′ or 3′ oxygen to the β-phosphate of ppAp would form interactions with the B1 site of RNase A similar to those of UVan. Therefore, the working structures were modified by removing O3B or O2B and then joining the β-phosphorus to O3′ or O2′, producing modeled complexes of RNase A with the compounds UppAp and U2′ppAp, respectively. The RNase A·UppAp model was then altered further by removing the 2′-OH group of the uridine ribose to prevent any possible RNase-catalyzed cleavage of the pyrophosphate linkage. The β-phosphorus-O-3′C angle in the resultant dUppAp model and the β-phosphorus-O-2′C angle in the theoretical U2′ppAp complex were similar to those in other B1-P1 bound nucleotides, and no steric clashes were observed. It should be noted that the pAp portions of dUppAp and U2′ppAp in the models bind to RNase A in precisely the same manner as that of ppAp in the crystal structure (i.e. this portion of the inhibitors was not moved during the modeling) but that the interactions of the adenosine β-phosphate differ somewhat due to the rotations of this group that were required. Thus, the lengths and/or angles of some H bonds with P1 residues may be less favorable than in the ppAp complex, where the phosphate was free to orient optimally. The preceding exercise suggested that the active site of RNase A can accommodate 2′(3′),5′-pyrophosphate-linked nucleotides and that dUppAp and U2′ppAp might bind to the enzyme more tightly than ppAp. The synthesis of these two nucleotides was therefore undertaken. A search of the structures of dUppAp and U2′ppAp (Fig. 4) in the Chemical Abstracts Service data base revealed that these compounds had not been described previously. Both were synthesized in solution by a combined chemical and enzymatic procedure (Fig. 5) similar to that reported for the preparation of ppAp (14Russo N. Shapiro R. Vallee B.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 231: 671-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). A mixture of 3′,5′- and 2′,5′-ADP (Fig. 5, I) was reacted with morpholine and carbodiimide to activate the 5′-phosphate and to protect the 2′(3′)-phosphate by converting it to a 2′,3′-cyclic phosphate. The product, adenosine 2′,3′-cyclic phosphate 5′-phosphomorpholidate (Fig. 5, II), was then reacted with dUp or uridine 2′-phosphate (Fig. 5, III) to yield 2′-deoxyuridine 3′-pyrophosphate, P′ → 5′-ester with adenosine 2′,3′-cyclic phosphate and uridine 2′-pyrophosphate, P′ → 5′-ester with adenosine 2′,3′-cyclic phosphate, respectively (Fig. 5, IV). The cyclic phosphates were then hydrolyzed to form the 3′-phosphate isomers dUppAp and U2′ppAp (Fig. 5, V) by incubation with RNase T2. These products were purified to >98% and >92% homogeneity, respectively. Both nucleotides eluted from a Mono Q column somewhat earlier than ppAp, consistent with their lower charges. Digestion with nucleotide pyrophosphatase in both cases yielded compounds that had the same retention times as the expected products (adenosine 3′,5′-diphosphate and either dUp or uridine 2′-phosphate) during Mono Q chromatography. Final confirmation of the proposed chemical structures was provided by high resolution mass spectrometry. The chemical stability of the two new compounds was also tested. Incubation of dUppAp for 3 days at neutral pH at 25 °C resulted in no detectable breakdown, whereas U2′ppAp had a half-life of about 5 days under the same conditions. Both compounds were found to be free of any measurable contaminant RNase.Figure 5Synthesis of dUppAp and U2′ ppAp . The reaction conditions were as follows: A, morpholine and dicyclohexylcarbodiimide in 70% t-butyl alcohol at boiling temperature; B, dry pyridine at room temperature;C, RNase T2 in 60 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5) at 37 °C.

In the present work, CyaC was produced inEscherichia coli as a histidine-tagged recombinant protein and purified to homogeneity. CyaC showed ability to autophosphorylatein vitro with the γ-phosphate of [γ-32P]ATP. CyaC derivatives were constructed by site-directed mutagenesis in which the highly conserved phosphorylation sites in the transmitter domain (His572) and receiver domains (Asp60 or Asp895) were replaced by glutamine and alanine residues, respectively. After autophosphorylation of the CyaC derivatives, the chemical stabilities of the phosphoryl groups bound to the derivatives were determined. It was found that His572 is the initial phosphorylation site and that the phosphoryl group once bound to His572 is transferred to Asp895. The enzyme activities of the CyaC derivatives defective in His572 or Asp895 were considerably reduced. Asp895 is phosphorylated by acetyl [32P]phosphate, a small phosphoryl molecule, but Asp60 is not. Acetyl phosphate stimulates adenylate cyclase activity only when Asp895 is intact. These results suggest that the phosphorylation of Asp895 is essential for the activation of adenylate cyclase and that Asp60 functions differently from Asp895 in regulating the enzyme activity.

Cyclic AMP (cAMP) is widely distributed from prokaryotes to eukaryotes as an important signaling molecule. In cyanobacteria, Gram-negative bacteria that are able to perform higher plant-type oxygen-evolving photosynthesis, it has been shown that cellular cAMP levels change in response to changes in environmental conditions such as light-dark, low pH-high pH, oxic-anoxic (1Ohmori M. Ohmori K. Hasunuma K. Arch. Microbiol. 1988; 150: 203-204Crossref Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 2Ohmori M.

In a gliding cyanobacterium, Spirulina platensis, extracellular cAMP stimulates the activity of respiration and gliding movement (4Ohmori K. Hirose M. Ohmori M. Plant Cell Physiol. 1992; 33: 21-25Google Scholar). These results suggest that cAMP functions as a signaling molecule in cyanobacteria, although the regulatory mechanism of cellular cAMP is yet to be elucidated. cAMP is synthesized from ATP by an adenylate cyclase, and the activity of adenylate cyclase is regulated by various mechanisms. Mammalian transmembrane adenylate cyclases are regulated by the stimulatory and inhibitory heterotrimeric G proteins in response to the binding of chemical ligands to appropriate signal receptors (5Taussig R. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1-4Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar).

The mammalian type V adenylate cyclase is phosphorylated by protein kinase C and protein kinase A, and phosphorylation regulates the activity of the enzyme (6Kawabe J. Iwami G. Ebina T. Ohno S.

Recently, a soluble adenylate cyclase has been isolated from mammalian testis (12Buck J. Sinclair M.L. Schapal L. Cann M.J. Levin L.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 79-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). The catalytic domains of this soluble adenylate cyclase are more similar to those of cyanobacterial adenylate cyclases than they are to those of mammalian transmembrane adenylate cyclases (12Buck J.

DNA Res. 1996; 3: 109-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (2133) Google Scholar). They have a fairly conserved catalytic domain near the C-terminal region and have characteristically different regulatory domains upstream of the catalytic domains. Among these genes,cyaC encodes a novel protein containing domains homologous to members of the bacterial two-component regulatory system, one transmitter domain and two receiver domains, in addition to the catalytic domain of adenylate cyclase (16Kasahara M. Yashiro K. Sakamoto T. Ohmori M. Plant Cell Physiol. 1997; 38: 828-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The CyaC protein seems to bind to the membrane of S. platensis cells, although it has no sufficient hydrophobic regions to pierce the membrane (16Kasahara M. Yashiro K. Sakamoto T. Ohmori M. Plant Cell Physiol. 1997; 38: 828-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Bacterial two-component regulatory systems, which provide the dominant modes of signal transduction in bacteria for adaptation to environmental changes, consist of two families of signal transduction proteins, the sensory kinase family and the response regulator family (18Parkinson J.S. Cell. 1993; 73: 857-871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar, 19Stock J.B. Ninfa A.J. Stock A.M. Microbiol. Rev. 1989; 53: 450-490Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The sensory kinases undergo autophosphorylation at a histidine residue in their transmitter domain in response to environmental stimuli, and the phosphoryl group once bound to the histidine residue is transferred to an aspartate residue in the receiver domain of the cognate response regulator. In most cases, response regulators act as transcriptional factors and control the expression of target genes. CheB in E. coli and RegA inDictyostelium discoideum exceptionally consist of a receiver domain and a catalytic domain of the enzyme, from methylesterase and phosphodiesterase, respectively. The enzymes are activated by phosphorylation of their receiver domains (20Lupas A. Stock J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 17337-17342Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Thomason P.A.

Several two-component regulatory proteins, so-called “hybrid sensory kinases,” contain both transmitter and receiver domains (22Plamann L. Li Y. Cantwell B. Mayor J. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 2014-2020Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23McCleary W.R. Zusman D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5898-5902Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 24Iuchi S.

It can be said that CyaC has a novel structure consisting of both “a hybrid sensory kinase” and a catalytic domain in one molecule. Studies on the function of CyaC are important not only to understand regulation of adenylate cyclase in cyanobacteria, but also to address general issues about the regulation of enzyme activity by two-component regulatory systems. In this study, we used recombinant proteins to investigate how CyaC is phosphorylated and whether the phosphorylation state controls the adenylate cyclase activity of CyaC. The E. colistrains used as hosts were JM109 (recA1, endA1,gyrA96, thi, hsdR17 (rK−, mK+), supE44, relA1, Δ(lac-proAB)/F′ (traD36, proAB,lacI q, Δ(lacZ)M15)) for cloning and BL21(DE3)pLysS (F−, ompT, hsdS(rB−, mB−), dcm, gal, λ(DE3), pLysS) for expression of recombinant proteins. Bacteria were grown in Luria-Bertani medium (26Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972Google Scholar).

A new restriction site (ApaLI) was created at position 268–273 without changing the amino acids. The ApaLI restriction enzyme was used in the screening for the mutagenized plasmid. The resulting PCR products were mixed, and PCR was repeated with primers pD11 and pD14. The PCR product was ligated into pCRII vector (Invitrogen) to make pCRD1. The DraI fragment of pCRD1 (220 base pairs) was ligated into pETA digested withDraI. The resulting construct, pETD1, contained thecyaC gene with the CyaC D60A mutation.

A new restriction site (AseI) was created at position 2777–2782 without changing the amino acids. TheAseI restriction enzyme was used in the screening for the mutagenized plasmid. The resulting PCR products were mixed, and PCR was repeated with primers pD21 and pD24. The PCR product was ligated into pCRII vector to make pCRD2. The BsrGI-AvaI fragment of pCRD2 (670 base pairs) was ligated into pETA digested withBsrGI and AvaI (partial digestion). The resulting construct, pETD2, contained the cyaC gene with the CyaC D895A mutation. The portions of pCRD1, pCRH, and pCRD2 derived from the PCR fragment were sequenced to ensure the existence of no other mutations. The CyaC D60A,D895A double mutant was constructed using pETD1 and pETD2. Both pETD1 and pETD2 were digested with BamHI andBsrG I. The 2.5-kb pETD1 fragment was ligated into the 6.5-kb pETD2 fragment. The resulting construct, pETD1D2, contains thecyaC gene with the CyaC D60A,D895A double mutation. The CyaC D60A,H572Q double mutant was constructed using theMfeI-BsrGI fragments of pETD1 (7.7 kb) and pETH (1.3 kb). The CyaC H572Q,D895A double mutant was constructed using theMfeI-BsrGI fragments of pETH (1.3 kb) and pETD2 (7.7 kb). The CyaC D60A,H572Q,D895A triple mutant was constructed using the MfeI-BsrGI fragments of pETD1D2 (7.7 kb) and pETH (1.3 kb). These constructs were produced by methods similar to those used for pETD1D2 construction. The purification procedure was essentially the same as that described previously (16Kasahara M. Yashiro K. Sakamoto T. Ohmori M. Plant Cell Physiol. 1997; 38: 828-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The transformants, BL21(DE3)pLysS cells harboring one of the expression constructs of the CyaC derivatives, were grown at 25 °C in Luria-Bertani medium (1.5 liters) supplemented with kanamycin (25 μg ml−1) and chloramphenicol (30 μg ml−1). Each recombinant cyaC gene was expressed in exponentially growing cells by adding 1 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. After 6 h, the cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed with 50 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.5) buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, and resuspended in 50 ml of extraction buffer consisting of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 10% (w/v) glycerol, 0.5m NaCl, 0.05% (w/v) Tween 80, 5 mm imidazole, 1 mm PMSF, and 1 mg ml−1 lysozyme. The cell suspension was incubated on ice for 30 min and then sonicated at 4 °C for 9 min (3 min × 3) using a Kubota model 200m sonicator. The cell extract was centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 10 min, and the supernatant was further centrifuged at 150,000 × g for 40 min. The 150,000 × g supernatant was loaded onto a HiTrap Chelating column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech; 1.6 × 2.5 cm) connected to a fast protein liquid chromatography system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and eluted using step gradients of 5, 30, 60, and 200 mm imidazole in Buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 10% (w/v) glycerol, 0.5 m NaCl, 0.05% (w/v) Tween 80). The volume of eluent used in each step gradient was 32, 16, 13, and 8.5 ml, respectively. The 200 mm imidazole fraction was concentrated to 0.5 ml using Ultrafree-15 (Millipore). The concentrated eluate was loaded onto a Superose 6 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech; 1 × 30 cm) and eluted with Buffer A containing 5 mm imidazole at a flow rate of 0.3 ml min−1. Unless otherwise stated, the assay mixture (final volume 15 μl) contained, besides the enzyme, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 200 mm KCl, 0.1 mm [γ-32P]ATP (∼6.7 μCi nmol−1), 1 mm MgCl2, 2 mm DTT, and 1 mm PMSF. The reaction, started by adding the enzyme, was run for 15 min at 30 °C and then terminated by the addition of 5 μl of 4 × SDS-PAGE loading buffer (200 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 400 mm DTT, 8% SDS, 40% glycerol, and 0.04% bromphenol blue). To avoid the release of phosphoryl groups, samples were heated immediately at 50 °C for 5 min (27Igo M.M. Ninfa A.J. Silhavy T.J. Genes Dev. 1988; 3: 598-605Crossref Scopus (95) Google Scholar) and applied to an 8% SDS-PAGE gel. The proteins were subsequently blotted onto an Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore) and subjected to autoradiography. The phosphorylation assay using acetyl [32P]phosphate was essentially the same as that described by Quon et al. (28Quon K.C. Marczynski G.T. Shapiro L. Cell. 1996; 84: 83-93Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). The synthesized acetyl [32P]phosphate (7.5 μl) was combined with each purified His-CyaC derivative in 7.5 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) buffer containing 2 mm DTT and 1 mm PMSF. The reactions were run at 30 °C for 15 min and terminated by the addition of 5 μl of 4 × SDS-PAGE loading buffer. The samples were heated immediately at 50 °C for 5 min and applied to an 8% SDS-PAGE gel. The proteins were subsequently blotted onto an Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore). The phosphorylated proteins were analyzed using a BAS1000 Imaging Analyzer (Fuji film). Unless otherwise stated, the assay mixture (final volume 0.2 ml) contained, besides the enzyme, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 200 mm KCl, 0.1 mm ATP, 1 mm MgCl2, 2 mm DTT, and 1 mm PMSF. The reaction was run for 15 min at 30 °C, terminated by the addition of 0.3 ml of 10% perchloric acid, and neutralized with 0.5 ml of 1.01 m KOH. The mixture was centrifuged at 200 × g for 10 min, and the cAMP content in the supernatants was measured by an enzyme immunoassay system according to the manufacture's protocol (EIA system, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Wild-type and mutant His-CyaC proteins were phosphorylated and blotted onto an Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore) as described above. The blots were incubated in 1 m HCl, 3m NaOH, or 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.2) at 25 °C. After incubation for 1 h, the membranes were washed briefly with distilled water, dried in air, and then exposed to an x-ray film. The CyaC protein has a multidomain structure consisting of the catalytic domain of adenylate cyclase and domains that are homologous to those of bacterial two-component regulatory systems. These domains exist in line from the N terminus: a receiver domain (R1), a transmitter domain, a receiver domain (R2), and a catalytic domain. The region between the receiver (R1) domain and the transmitter domain shows similarity to the ETR1 protein that has been identified as an ethylene receptor in plants (29Chang C. Kwok S.F. Bleecker A.B. Meyerowitz E.M. Science. 1993; 262: 539-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (1211) Google Scholar, 30Schaller G.E. Bleecker A.B. Science. 1995; 270: 1809-1811Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). Eight kinds of CyaC derivatives were constructed and each protein was fused with a histidine tag (Fig. 1A). The proteins were purified as described under “Experimental Procedures,” and the purities were determined by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1B). One band with a molecular mass of 140 kDa was observed in each lane. In the previous work, we showed that the catalytic activity of the CyaC protein is stimulated by Mn2+ and less extensively by Mg2+ (16Kasahara M. Yashiro K. Sakamoto T. Ohmori M. Plant Cell Physiol. 1997; 38: 828-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The specific activities (Mg2+- or Mn2+-dependent adenylate cyclase activity) of the purified wild-type His-CyaC protein used in this study were 7.4 and 260 nmol of cAMP formed mg−1·min−1, respectively. The specific activities are higher than those used in the previous work (16Kasahara M. Yashiro K. Sakamoto T. Ohmori M. Plant Cell Physiol. 1997; 38: 828-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). This is due to improvements in the purification procedure as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The molecular mass of His-CyaC was estimated to be 590 kDa by Superose 6 column chromatography, a kind of gel permeation column chromatography, suggesting that His-CyaC forms a homotetramer inE. coli. Autophosphorylation of His-CyaC was assayed by incubating the proteins with [α-32P]ATP or [γ-32P]ATP and Mg2+ or Mn2+. Radiolabeling was obtained when His-CyaC was incubated with [γ-32P]ATP but not with [α-32P]ATP (Fig. 2), indicating that the phosphorylation of His-CyaC is γ-phosphate specific. Mg2+ and Mn2+ had similar effects on the autophosphorylation activity of His-CyaC (Fig. 2, lanes 2 and 4), although the adenylate cyclase activity of His-CyaC was stimulated by Mn2+ (16Kasahara M. Yashiro K. Sakamoto T. Ohmori M. Plant Cell Physiol. 1997; 38: 828-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Mn2+might activate the catalytic activity of CyaC independently of the autophosphorylation activity. The His572 residue of CyaC corresponds to the highly conserved histidine residue found in sensory kinases of bacterial two-component regulatory systems. The Asp60 and Asp895residues of CyaC correspond to a highly conserved aspartate residue among the response regulators of bacterial two-component regulatory systems (16Kasahara M. Yashiro K. Sakamoto T. Ohmori M. Plant Cell Physiol. 1997; 38: 828-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 18Parkinson J.S. Cell. 1993; 73: 857-871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar, 19Stock J.B. Ninfa A.J. Stock A.M. Microbiol. Rev. 1989; 53: 450-490Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To determine the role of these residues in the phosphorylation of CyaC, autophosphorylation activities were assayed using His-CyaC(wild-type), His-CyaC(D60A), His-CyaC(H572Q), His-CyaC(D895A), and His-CyaC(D60A,D895A) (Fig. 1). The results show that His-CyaC(H572Q) is unable to autophosphorylate in vitro (Fig. 3). Thus, His572 is thought to be the initial phosphorylation site in CyaC. The levels of phosphorylation observed in His-CyaC(wild-type) and His-CyaC(D60A) were lower than those observed in His-CyaC(D895A) and His-CyaC(D60A,D895A). Chemical stability assays have been performed to determine the class of phosphorylated amino acid.N-Phosphate bonds (phosphohistidine or phospholysine) are base-stable and acid-labile. Acyl phosphate bonds (phosphoaspartate or phosphoglutamate) are labile to both acid and base, andO-phosphate bonds (phosphoserine, phosphothreonine, or phosphotyrosine) are stable to acid (31Koshland D.E.J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1951; 74: 2286-2292Crossref Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 32Duclos B. Marcandier S. Cozzone A.J. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 10-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). To compare the stability of phosphate links in the phosphorylated wild-type and mutant His-CyaC proteins, each phosphorylated product was subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred to an Immobilon-P membrane. The membrane strips were treated with acid, base, or neutral buffer. Compared with the control treated with neutral buffer, His-CyaC(wild-type) and His-CyaC(D60A) retained 64 and 69% of their label after base treatment, whereas His-CyaC(D895A) and His-CyaC(D60A,D895A) retained 94 and 89% of their label, respectively (Fig. 4). When treated with acid, His-CyaC(wild-type) and His-CyaC(D60A) retained 19 and 20%, respectively, of their label, whereas His-CyaC(D895A) and His-CyaC(D60A,D895A) retained no label (Fig. 4). The phosphoryl groups in phosphorylated His-CyaC(wild-type) and His-CyaC(D60A) were partially labile under base conditions and labile under acid conditions, whereas those in phosphorylated His-CyaC(D895A) and His-CyaC(D60A,D895A) were stable under base conditions but labile under acid conditions. Portions of the phosphate links in phosphorylated His-CyaC(wild-type) and His-CyaC(D60A) seem to be phosphoacyl linkages, which are labile under both acid and base conditions. The phosphate links in phosphorylated His-CyaC(D895A) and His-CyaC(D60A,D895A) seem to be N-phosphate linkages, which are stable under base conditions but labile under acid conditions (32Duclos B. Marcandier S. Cozzone A.J. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 10-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). The adenylate cyclase activities of His-CyaC derivatives were compared with that of His-CyaC(wild-type) in vitro(Fig. 5). The components in the reaction mixtures and the assay conditions were the same as those used for the autophosphorylation reaction except that the final volume of the reaction mixtures differed. The adenylate cyclase activities of His-CyaC(D60A), His-CyaC(H572Q), His-CyaC(D895A), and His-CyaC(D60A,D895A) were 75, 23, 21, and 11% that of His-CyaC(wild-type), respectively. The adenylate cyclase activity of His-CyaC was decreased considerably by replacement of the His572 or Asp895 residues with other amino acids. Several response regulator proteins have been shown to be phosphorylated at a conserved aspartate residue in the receiver domain by small molecular weight phospho-donors such as acetyl phosphate, carbamoyl phosphate, and phosphoramidate (33McCleary W.R. Stock J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31567-31572Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34Lukat G.S. McCleary W.R. Stock A.M. Stock J.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 718-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). It was determined whether Asp60and Asp895, the highly conserved phosphorylation sites in the receiver domains of CyaC, are phosphorylated by acetyl [32P]phosphate. When His-CyaC(H572Q), His-CyaC(H572Q,D60A), His-CyaC(H572Q,D895A), and His-CyaC(H572Q,D60A,D895A) (Fig. 1) were incubated with acetyl [32P]phosphate, the His-CyaC(H572Q) and His-CyaC (H572Q,D60A) proteins were phosphorylated but the His-CyaC(H572Q,D895A) and His-CyaC(H572Q,D60A,D895A) proteins were not (Fig. 6). These results show that Asp895 is phosphorylated but Asp60 is not phosphorylated by acetyl phosphate and that these two amino acid residues have somewhat different physiological functions. The adenylate cyclase activities of His-CyaC(H572Q), His-CyaC(H572Q,D60A), His-CyaC(H572Q, D895A), and His-CyaC(H572Q,D60A,D895A) were measured in the presence or absence of acetyl phosphate. Acetyl phosphate greatly activated the adenylate cyclase activities of His-CyaC(H572Q) and His-CyaC(H572Q,D60A) (Fig. 7), while His-CyaC(H572Q,D895A) and His-CyaC(H572Q,D60A,D895A) were largely unaffected. Thus, the presence of Asp895 is essential for the activation of adenylate cyclase activity. Acetyl phosphate might activate the catalytic activity of the adenylate cyclase by phosphorylating Asp895 in His-CyaC. A cyanobacterial adenylate cyclase, CyaC, has been shown to have a unique structure consisting of one transmitter domain and two receiver domains of bacterial two-component regulatory systems in addition to the catalytic domain of adenylate cyclase (15Katayama M. Ohmori M. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 3588-3593Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Kasahara M. Yashiro K. Sakamoto T. Ohmori M. Plant Cell Physiol. 1997; 38: 828-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The possibility has been considered that the autophosphorylation of the transmitter domain and subsequent phosphotransfer to the receiver domains within the molecule regulates the catalytic activity. In the present study, CyaC was shown to have the ability to autophosphorylate with [γ-32P]ATP in vitro. On the other hand, the CyaC H572Q mutant was shown to be incapable of autophosphorylation. Thus, His572 in the transmitter domain is thought to be the initial phosphorylation site in CyaC. Studies on the stability of phosphate links in phosphorylated CyaC derivatives showed that the wild-type and D60A mutant proteins contain both an acyl phosphate linkage and N-phosphate linkage, whereas the D895A mutant and the D60A,D895A double mutant CyaC contain anN-phosphate linkage alone. The fact that the acyl phosphate linkage in phosphorylated CyaC is lost when Asp895 is replaced by an alanine residue indicates that Asp895 is actually phosphorylated. Thus, after the autophosphorylation of His572 in the transmitter domain, the phosphoryl group bound to His572 is transferred to Asp895 in the receiver (R2) domain. Asp60, the predicted phosphorylation site in the receiver (R1) domain, is not likely to be phosphorylated by the phosphotransfer reaction from the transmitter domain of CyaC. AsgA of Myxococcus xanthus, which is required for the formation of fruiting bodies, consists of a receiver domain on the N-terminal side and a transmitter domain on the C-terminal side. The primary structure of the two domains of AsgA is similar to the receiver (R1) domain and the transmitter domain of CyaC. It has been shown that AsgA autophosphorylates in the transmitter domain but that the phosphoryl group once bound to the transmitter domain is not transferred to the receiver domain. Plamann et al. (22Plamann L. Li Y. Cantwell B. Mayor J. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 2014-2020Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) proposed that the AsgA receiver domain functions as an input domain for the transmitter. Interestingly, when a homology search was performed using the GenBankTM BLAST server, the receiver (R1) domain of CyaC showed especially high similarity to the receiver domain of AsgA in comparison with other receiver domains in response regulator proteins. The receiver (R1) domain of CyaC may have a function similar to that of the receiver domain of AsgA. The adenylate cyclase activity of the CyaC H572Q mutant, which does not autophosphorylate, is about 4-fold lower than that of wild-type CyaC. Furthermore, the adenylate cyclase activities of the CyaC D895A mutant and CyaC D60A,D895A double mutant, which are able to autophosphorylate but unable to transfer the phosphoryl group from His572 to Asp895, are at least 5-fold lower than that of wild-type CyaC. Thus the phosphorylation of Asp895 is required for the full activity of CyaC, consistent with the results that CyaC is phosphorylated at Asp895 by acetyl phosphate (Fig. 6) and that the adenylate cyclase activity is stimulated in the presence of acetyl phosphate (Fig. 7). These results indicate that CyaC autophosphorylates first at His572 in the transmitter domain, after which the phosphoryl group is transferred to Asp895 in the receiver (R2) domain, and this stimulates the adenylate cyclase activity (Fig. 8). Small phosphorylated molecules, such as acetyl phosphate, phosphoramidate, and carbamoyl phosphate, can act as phosphodonors for the phosphorylation of the receiver domains of response regulators in place of phosphorylated transmitter domains. Each response regulator protein shows different reactivities toward these small compounds (33McCleary W.R. Stock J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31567-31572Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Spo0F, a response regulator protein in Bacillus subtilis, is not phosphorylated by acetyl phosphate in vitro while it is phosphorylated by a sensory kinase, KinA (35Hoch J.A. Hoch J.A. Silhavy T.J. Two-component Signal Transduction. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1995: 129-144Google Scholar). In CyaC, the two receiver domains show different responses to acetyl phosphate; Asp895 is phosphorylated by acetyl phosphate, while Asp60 is not (Fig. 6). This probably reflects that the two aspartate residues have different physiological functions. It is probable that phosphoryl groups may be transferred to Asp60residue of the receiver (R1) domain from the transmitter domains of other sensory kinases that have not yet been identified. The autophosphorylation activity, the phosphotransfer from His572 to Asp895, or the adenylate cyclase activity of CyaC may be regulated by the phosphorylation of Asp60. We note that the phosphorylation levels observed in His-CyaC(wild-type) and His-CyaC(D60A), which are phosphorylated at both His572and Asp895, are lower than those observed in His-CyaC(D895A) and His-CyaC(D60A,D895A). In the receiver domain (R2) derivatives, phosphoryl groups accumulate at His572, because phosphoryl groups bound to His572 are not transferred (Fig. 3). The low levels of phosphorylation observed in His-CyaC(wild-type) and His-CyaC(D60A) may be caused by dephosphorylation from phosphorylated Asp895. The phosphoryl groups of several phosphorylated response regulators are known to hydrolyze very rapidly. The half-life of hydrolysis of the phosphoaspartate group in phospho-CheY, a response regulator protein required for chemotaxis, is a few seconds (36Hess J.F. Oosawa K. Kaplan N. Simon M.I. Cell. 1988; 53: 79-87Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). This instability is called autophosphatase activity. In addition, some sensory kinases are known to function to facilitate the rate of dephosphorylation of their cognate response regulators (37Russo F.D. Slauch J.M. Shilhavy T.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 231: 261-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). CyaC also must have a mechanism to dephosphorylate its phosphorylated form. The rapid dephosphorylation from phosphorylated Asp895 may be required to respond to subsequent signals. However, there is a possibility that the rate of autophosphorylation decreases when Asp895 is phosphorylated. It is noted that CyaC shows significant adenylate cyclase activity even if Asp895 is not phosphorylated. This is similar to CheB and RegA, which are alternative proteins with the catalytic domain of an enzyme beside the receiver domain of the bacterial two-component regulatory systems (20Lupas A. Stock J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 17337-17342Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Thomason P.A. Traynor D. Cavet G. Chang W. Harwood A.J. Kay R.R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2838-2845Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). It is likely that the autophosphorylation activity of CyaC is regulated by sensing a specific signal that is transferred from a primary signal sensor of the cell. In sensory kinases, the N-terminal side of the transmitter domain is thought to be a signal input domain (18Parkinson J.S. Cell. 1993; 73: 857-871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar, 19Stock J.B. Ninfa A.J. Stock A.M. Microbiol. Rev. 1989; 53: 450-490Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The presumed signal input domain of CyaC, which was called the ETR1-like domain in the previous work (16Kasahara M. Yashiro K. Sakamoto T. Ohmori M. Plant Cell Physiol. 1997; 38: 828-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), is similar to the ethylene sensor ofArabidopsis thaliana (ETR1) and to RcaE, the sensor for the complementary chromatic adaptation of Fremyella diplosiphon. This domain also exists in several other sensory kinases ofSynechocystis PCC 6803 (17Kaneko T. Sato S. Kotani H. Tanaka A. Asamizu E. Nakamura Y. Miyajima N. Hirosawa M. Sugiura M. Sasamoto S. Kimura T. Hosouchi T. Matsuno A. Muraki A. Nakazak N. Naruo K. Okumura S. Shimpo S. Takeuchi C. Wada T. Watanabe A. Yamada M. Yasuda M. Tabata S. DNA Res. 1996; 3: 109-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (2133) Google Scholar). Although the function of the ETR1-like domain remains unknown, it may participate in the recognition of a specific signal. A CyaC homologue is found in the cyanobacterium Anabaena sp. strain PCC 7120 (15Katayama M. Ohmori M. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 3588-3593Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), in which cellular cAMP levels are reduced in response to a light-on signal. On the other hand, cAMP levels in the disruptant of the cyaC homologue are not affected by the light-on signal (15Katayama M. Ohmori M. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 3588-3593Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It has been suggested that CyaC responds to a light signal; however, CyaC itself would not be a photoreceptor because it has no typical chromophore binding motifs in its amino acid sequence. Recently, a phytochrome that acts as a sensory photoreceptor in plants has been found in the cyanobacterium SynechocystisPCC 6803 (17Kaneko T. Sato S. Kotani H. Tanaka A. Asamizu E. Nakamura Y. Miyajima N. Hirosawa M. Sugiura M. Sasamoto S. Kimura T. Hosouchi T. Matsuno A. Muraki A. Nakazak N. Naruo K. Okumura S. Shimpo S. Takeuchi C. Wada T. Watanabe A. Yamada M. Yasuda M. Tabata S. DNA Res. 1996; 3: 109-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (2133) Google Scholar, 38Yeh K. Wu S. Murphy J.T. Lagarias J.C. Science. 1997; 277: 1505-1508Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). The cyanobacterial phytochrome consists of two functional domains, an N-terminal domain homologous to the chromophore attachment domain of the phytochrome and a C-terminal domain homologous to the transmitter domain of the sensory kinase. Such a photoreceptor having phosphorylation capability might control the activity of CyaC through the mechanism of a phosphotransfer reaction.

https://openalex.org/W2025634059,"We previously reported that residues 299–318 in Gαi1 participate in the selective interaction between Gαi1 and the 5-hydroxytryptamine1B(5-HT1B) receptor (Bae, H., Anderson, K., Flood, L. A., Skiba, N. P., Hamm, H. E., and Graber, S. G. (1997)J. Biol. Chem. 272, 32071–32077). The present study more precisely defines which residues within this domain are critical for 5-HT1B receptor-mediated G protein activation. A series of Gαi1/Gαt chimeras and point mutations were reconstituted with Gβγ and Sf9 cell membranes containing the 5-HT1B receptor. Functional coupling to 5-HT1B receptors was assessed by 1) [35S]GTPγS binding and 2) agonist affinity shift assays. Replacement of the α4 helix of Gαi1 (residues 299–308) with the corresponding sequence from Gαtproduced a chimera (Chi22) that only weakly coupled to the 5-HT1B receptor. In contrast, substitution of residues within the α4-β6 loop region of Gαi1 (residues 309–318) with the corresponding sequence in Gαt either permitted full 5-HT1B receptor coupling to the chimera (Chi24) or only minimally reduced coupling to the chimeric protein (Chi25). Two mutations within the α4 helix of Gαi1 (Q304K and E308L) reduced agonist-stimulated [35S]GTPγS binding, and the effects of these mutations were additive. The opposite substitutions within Chi22 (K300Q and L304E) restored 5-HT1B receptor coupling, and again the effects of the two mutations were additive. Mutations of other residues within the α4 helix of Gαi1 had minimal to no effect on 5-HT1B coupling behavior. These data provide evidence that α4 helix residues in Gαi participate in directing specific receptor interactions and suggest that Gln304 and Glu308 of Gαi1 act in concert to mediate the ability of the 5-HT1B receptor to couple specifically to inhibitory G proteins. We previously reported that residues 299–318 in Gαi1 participate in the selective interaction between Gαi1 and the 5-hydroxytryptamine1B(5-HT1B) receptor (Bae, H., Anderson, K., Flood, L. A., Skiba, N. P., Hamm, H. E., and Graber, S. G. (1997)J. Biol. Chem. 272, 32071–32077). The present study more precisely defines which residues within this domain are critical for 5-HT1B receptor-mediated G protein activation. A series of Gαi1/Gαt chimeras and point mutations were reconstituted with Gβγ and Sf9 cell membranes containing the 5-HT1B receptor. Functional coupling to 5-HT1B receptors was assessed by 1) [35S]GTPγS binding and 2) agonist affinity shift assays. Replacement of the α4 helix of Gαi1 (residues 299–308) with the corresponding sequence from Gαtproduced a chimera (Chi22) that only weakly coupled to the 5-HT1B receptor. In contrast, substitution of residues within the α4-β6 loop region of Gαi1 (residues 309–318) with the corresponding sequence in Gαt either permitted full 5-HT1B receptor coupling to the chimera (Chi24) or only minimally reduced coupling to the chimeric protein (Chi25). Two mutations within the α4 helix of Gαi1 (Q304K and E308L) reduced agonist-stimulated [35S]GTPγS binding, and the effects of these mutations were additive. The opposite substitutions within Chi22 (K300Q and L304E) restored 5-HT1B receptor coupling, and again the effects of the two mutations were additive. Mutations of other residues within the α4 helix of Gαi1 had minimal to no effect on 5-HT1B coupling behavior. These data provide evidence that α4 helix residues in Gαi participate in directing specific receptor interactions and suggest that Gln304 and Glu308 of Gαi1 act in concert to mediate the ability of the 5-HT1B receptor to couple specifically to inhibitory G proteins. The interaction of heptahelical receptors with their cognate heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding proteins (G proteins) represents an initial step in the transmission of extracellular signals across the plasma membrane (2Conklin B.R. Bourne H.R. Cell. 1993; 73: 631-641Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar, 3Neer E.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 249-257Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1280) Google Scholar, 4Hamm H.E. Gilchrist A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 189-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). The receptor-G protein interaction modulates specific second messenger systems that result in a unique physiologic response to the extracellular signal. The particular downstream effect of G protein activation is not the result of an explicit interaction between each heptahelical receptor and a unique heterotrimeric G protein. On the contrary, G protein-coupled receptors have repeatedly been demonstrated to couple to several related members within the same family of G protein α subunits, albeit with differing levels of efficiency (5Munshi R.

Nevertheless, this receptor does not couple to heterotrimers containing another member of this same family, the Gαt subunit (12Clawges H.M. Depree K.M. Parker E.M. Graber S.G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12930-12938Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Therefore, the 5-HT1B receptor represents one receptor system that can be exploited to investigate the precise molecular determinants governing selective receptor-G protein interactions. Numerous biochemical studies have suggested that several subregions of Gα (13Conklin B.R. Farfel Z. Lustig K.D. Julius D. Bourne H.R.

The carboxyl-terminal domain of Gα subunits, in particular, has been demonstrated to play a key role in eliciting several specific receptor-G protein interactions. However, the carboxyl-terminal regions of Gαi1, Gαi2, Gαi3, and Gαt are highly homologous, and therefore, the carboxyl-terminal domain is not likely to be the primary determinant of 5-HT1B receptor-G protein selectivity between Gαi/o and Gαt. The selectivity profile of the 5-HT1B receptor has facilitated the use of Gαi/Gαt chimeras to map the residues that play a role in determining the specific interaction of the 5-HT1B receptor to inhibitory G proteins. By using this approach, we previously demonstrated that substitution of the α4 helix and α4–β6 loop (amino acids 299–318) regions of Gαi with the respective sequence from Gαtmarkedly reduced the ability of this chimera to couple to the 5-HT1B receptor (1Bae H. Anderson K. Flood L.A. Skiba N.P. Hamm H.E. Graber S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32071-32077Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). These studies determined that the region corresponding to amino acids 299–318 in Gαi1plays a key role in determining the selective interaction between Gαi1 and the 5-HT1B receptor (1Bae H. Anderson K. Flood L.A. Skiba N.P. Hamm H.E. Graber S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32071-32077Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The intent of the present study was to define more precisely which amino acids within this domain are critical for selective 5-HT1Breceptor coupling to inhibitory G proteins. In addition to providing a useful model for receptor-G protein selectivity, the 5-HT1B receptor plays an important modulatory role in the central nervous system. 5-HT1Breceptors are the primary terminal autoreceptors within the brain serotonin system (26Engel G. Gothert M. Hoyer D. Schlicker E. Hillenbrand K. Naunyn-Schmidedbergs Arch. Pharmakol. 1986; 332: 1-7Crossref Scopus (619) Google Scholar). Activation of these receptors inhibits the release of 5-HT into the synaptic cleft (27Hamblin M.W. Metcalf M.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1991; 40: 143-148PubMed Google Scholar, 28Middlemiss D.N. Bremer M.E. Smith S.M. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1988; 157: 101-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). In addition, drugs that selectively interact with 5-HT1B receptors have proven to be clinically useful for the treatment of migraine headache (29Goadsby P.J. Clin. Neurosci. 1998; 5: 18-23PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, deducing the molecular events that are essential to 5-HT1B receptor-catalyzed G protein activation may aid our understanding of both normal and pathologic processes in brain serotonin systems. By utilizing a series of Gαi/Gαt chimeras coupled with site-directed mutagenesis, the present study reveals that α4 helical residues Gln304 and Glu308 of Gαi1 are critical determinants of 5-HT1Breceptor coupling to inhibitory G proteins. This conclusion is supported by the observed marked reduction in receptor-catalyzed GDP/GTP exchange on Gαi1 Q304K, E308L, and Q304K-E308L mutants. Moreover, whereas Gln304 and Glu308are absolutely conserved among all Gαi/o isoforms, they are divergent between Gαi/o and Gαtsubunits. The crystal structure of Gαi reveals that Gln304 and Glu308 are surface-exposed (30Coleman D.E. Berghuis A.M. Lee E. Linder M.E. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Science. 1994; 265: 1405-1412Crossref PubMed Scopus (745) Google Scholar, 31Wall M.A. Coleman D.E. Lee E. Iniguez-Lluhi J.A. Posner B.A. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Cell. 1995; 83: 1047-1058Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1002) Google Scholar), and mutation of these residues (Q304K and E308L) may alter the surface potential of the α subunit. Hence, these residues may interact directly with the 5-HT1B receptor to mediate receptor coupling. Mutation of these residues may also indirectly influence the secondary structure of neighboring domains resulting in an inability of the 5-HT1B receptor to couple to the mutant inhibitory α subunits. Nucleotides and enzymes were purchased either from Boehringer Mannheim or from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Serotonin was obtained from Sigma. [35S]GTPγS (1250 Ci/mmol) and [3H]5-HT (22–30 Ci/mmol) were purchased from NEN Life Science Products. The present study used the Escherichia coli expression vectors pHis6Gαi1 or pHis6Chi3 that contain a nucleotide sequence encoding a hexa-histidine tag under the control of a T7 promoter (32Skiba N.P. Bae H. Hamm H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 413-424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). BamHI and HindIII digestion of pHis6Chi3 released a 450-base pair DNA fragment corresponding to amino acid residues 214–354 of Chi3. This fragment was subcloned into pUC19 (pUC19-Chi3). To construct Chi22, Chi24, and Chi25, duplex oligonucleotides containing the desired mutations were ligated into the NaeI- andBglII-digested pUC19-Chi3. Sequences were confirmed, and the correct pUC19-based chimeras were cloned into the pHis6Gαi1 as a BamHI andHindIII fragment. Generation of the BamHI site in pHis6Gαi1 did not mutate any residues. Site-directed mutagenesis of either Chi22 or Gαi1 was carried out using the QuikChangeTM Site-directed Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Either pHis6Gαi1 or pHis6Chi22 served as the template for polymerase chain reaction-based mutagenesis. Hexa-histidine-tagged Gαi1 or chimeric Gα subunits were expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) cells and purified as described (32Skiba N.P. Bae H. Hamm H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 413-424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) with minor modification. Briefly, cell pellets were resuspended in buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2) supplemented with 50 μm GDP, 0.1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 5 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, sonicated, and then centrifuged at 100,000 ×g for 60 min. The supernatant was loaded onto a Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose resin column (His-Bond, Novagen). Eluted samples were dialyzed overnight against buffer A in the presence of 20% glycerol, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol and then further purified by high performance liquid chromatography (Waters Protein-Pak QHR-15, Waters Chromatography). Protein concentrations were determined using the Coomassie Blue method (33Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211983) Google Scholar) with bovine serum albumin (Pierce) as the standard. For affinity shift assays, the expression and purification of the G protein α subunits in Sf9 cells was performed as described (34Graber S.G. Figler R.A. Garrison J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1271-1278Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 35Boyer J.L. Graber S.G. Waldo G.L. Harden T.K. Garrison J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2814-2819Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) except that the final chromatography step was performed on 15-micron Waters Protein-Pak QHR (Waters Chromatography). Recombinant β1γ2 subunits were purified from Sf9 cells using a His6-γ2 as described by Kozasa and Gilman (36Kozasa T. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1734-1741Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). The native retinal βγ subunits used for the GTPγS binding experiment were purified as described (37Mazzoni M.R. Malinski J.A. Hamm H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14072-14081Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Sf9 cells were infected with recombinant baculovirus containing cDNA for the 5-HT1B receptor, cultured, and harvested as described (34Graber S.G. Figler R.A. Garrison J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1271-1278Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Membranes were prepared according to a previously published protocol (1Bae H. Anderson K. Flood L.A. Skiba N.P. Hamm H.E. Graber S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32071-32077Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Briefly, harvested cells were thawed and resuspended in ice-cold homogenization buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 25 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 μg/ml benzamidine and 2 μg/ml each of aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin A) and burst by N2 cavitation. Cavitated cells were centrifuged at low speed; the supernatant was removed and then centrifuged at 28,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The resulting pellets were resuspended in 5 mm NaHEPES, pH 7.5, containing 1 mm EDTA and supplemented with the aforementioned protease inhibitors. The membranes were washed twice and resuspended in the same buffer (1–3 mg of protein/ml). Frozen Sf9 membranes were reconstituted as described (1Bae H. Anderson K. Flood L.A. Skiba N.P. Hamm H.E. Graber S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32071-32077Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Briefly, membranes were pelleted and resuspended in reconstitution buffer (5 mm NaHEPES, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 500 nm GDP, 0.04% CHAPS). G protein subunits were diluted in the same buffer, and the mixture was incubated at 25 °C for 15 min and then held on ice. The reconstitution mixture was diluted with binding assay buffer as described (1Bae H. Anderson K. Flood L.A. Skiba N.P. Hamm H.E. Graber S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32071-32077Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). [3H]5-HT binding to 5-HT1Breceptors reconstituted with Gα and Gβ1γ2was determined as described previously (1Bae H. Anderson K. Flood L.A. Skiba N.P. Hamm H.E. Graber S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32071-32077Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). To estimate receptor number in individual membrane preparations, the membranes were reconstituted with a large excess (5 μm) of G protein heterotrimers containing Gαi1 and the 5-HT1B receptors labeled with 1, 10, and 40 nm [3H]5-HT. It has been shown that such reconstitution effectively converts all of the expressed receptors to a coupled, high affinity for agonist state (12Clawges H.M. Depree K.M. Parker E.M. Graber S.G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12930-12938Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar).B max values were estimated by nonlinear regression analysis with GraphPad PRISM of the specific binding data using a fixed value (0.62 nm) for the high affinityK D (12Clawges H.M. Depree K.M. Parker E.M. Graber S.G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12930-12938Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). For affinity shift assays, high affinity binding to 5-HT1B receptors was determined using a single concentration of [3H]5-HT near the K Dvalue for the radioligand (0.8–1.3 nm). A GTPγS binding assay was used to quantitate receptor-catalyzed GDP/GTP exchange on Gα subunits as described (1Bae H. Anderson K. Flood L.A. Skiba N.P. Hamm H.E. Graber S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32071-32077Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Briefly, membranes were incubated with 1 mmAMP-PNP at 37 °C for 1 h, and receptor coupling was reconstituted with Gα and Gβγ subunits on ice in 70 μl of reaction buffer A (25 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 5 mmMgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol) for 30 min and then diluted with 200 μl of reaction buffer A containing 150 nm GDP and 60 nm GTPγS. The addition of 30 μl of [35S]GTPγS (∼7 × 106 cpm) initiated the reaction which was incubated at 25 °C. The following final concentrations were used for the GTPγS assay: 1.28 nm5-HT1B, 40 nm Gα, and 40 nmretinal βγ. For agonist activation, 1 μm of 5-HT was included. Aliquots (20 μl) were withdrawn at various times, and the reaction was terminated by filtration. Radioactivity retained on the filters was quantitated with a liquid scintillation counter. As the actual receptor densities and protein concentrations varied in different experiments, some degree of variation in the absolute level of GTPγS binding was observed. As rhodopsin can couple to either Gt or Gi heterotrimers with equal efficiency (32Skiba N.P. Bae H. Hamm H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 413-424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), GTPγS binding data were normalized to the percent of maximal binding that occurred after incubating samples for 30 min in the presence of an excess amount (500 nm) of light-activated rhodopsin. To ensure that recombinant Gα proteins are properly folded, instrinsic fluorescence of the subunits was measured as described (1Bae H. Anderson K. Flood L.A. Skiba N.P. Hamm H.E. Graber S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32071-32077Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 32Skiba N.P. Bae H. Hamm H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 413-424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Briefly, the AlF4−-dependent conformational changes of activated Gα subunits were monitored by intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence changes with excitation at 280 nm and emission at 340 nm. The relative increase in fluorescence of 200 nm Gα subunits was determined from absorbance readings before and after the addition of 10 mm NaF and 20 μm AlCl3. Affinity shift activity data and the initial rates of GDP/GTP exchange (Table I) were analyzed separately using a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA).

The ability of 5-HT1B receptors to couple selectively to heterotrimers containing members of the Gαi/o family of G proteins (12Clawges H.M. Depree K.M. Parker E.M. Graber S.G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12930-12938Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) facilitated the use of a series of Gαi/Gαt chimeras to determine which amino acids within Gαi mediate this specific interaction. By using this approach, we previously demonstrated that Gαi1amino acid residues 299–318 (corresponding to the α4 helix and α4-β6 loop regions of Gαi1) play a major role in determining the selective interaction with the 5-HT1Breceptor (1Bae H.

Additional residues in the amino-terminal domain of Gαi1 were also determined to play a secondary role in 5-HT1B receptor coupling (1Bae H. Anderson K. Flood L.A. Skiba N.P. Hamm H.E. Graber S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32071-32077Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The present study initially used the same approach described above to identify which subdomain within this stretch of amino acids (Gαi1 299–318) is critical for functional 5-HT1B receptor coupling to inhibitory G proteins. As shown schematically in Fig. 1, three chimeric Gαi/Gαt proteins were generated in which either the α4 helix (Chi22) or portions of the α4–β6 loop region (Chi24 and Chi25) of Gαi1 were replaced with the corresponding sequence from Gαt. Prior to the assessment of coupling activity, the ability of each chimeric Gα subunit to bind GDP and undergo conformational change upon binding to GTP was tested by determining if the proteins undergo an AlF4−-dependent increase in tryptophan fluorescence (32Skiba N.P. Bae H. Hamm H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 413-424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). This assay is based on the ability of AlF4−, which mimics the γ-phosphate of GTP, to induce the active conformation, which then results in an increase in intrinsic fluorescence of Trp211 in Gαi1. Tryptophan fluorescence of all mutants and Gαi1 used in this study increased 40–45% upon the addition of AlF4− (Fig. 1), consistent with our previous results (1Bae H. Anderson K. Flood L.A.

Functional coupling between the 5-HT1B receptor and the chimeric proteins was assessed by examining both the ability of the 5-HT receptor agonist, serotonin, to stimulate receptor-catalyzed GDP/[35S]GTPγS exchange on the α subunit, and the ability of the chimeric protein to induce the high affinity agonist binding state of the receptor (affinity shift activity).

This observation suggests that DNA-PK may have a physiological role in the heat shock response. To investigate this possibility, we performed a comparison of cell lines that were deficient in either the Ku protein or the DNA-PK catalytic subunit versus the same cell lines that had been rescued by the introduction of a functional gene. DNA-PK-negative cell lines were up to 10-fold more sensitive to heat-induced apoptosis than matched DNA-PK-positive cell lines. There may be a regulatory interaction between DNA-PK and HSF1 in vivo, because constitutive overexpression of HSF1 sensitized the DNA-PK-positive cells to heat but had no effect in DNA-PK-negative cells. The initial burst of hsp70 mRNA expression was similar in DNA-PK-negative and -positive cell lines, but the DNA-PK-negative cells showed an attenuated rate of mRNA synthesis at later times and, in some cases, lower heat shock protein expression. These findings provide evidence for an antiapoptotic function of DNA-PK that is experimentally separable from its mechanical role in DNA double strand break repair.

Ku protein binds avidly to DNA ends (1Mimori T. Hardin J.A. Steitz J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 2274-2278Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and recruits DNA-PKcs to form an active complex (2Dvir A. Peterson S.R. Knuth M.W. Lu H. Dynan W.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

Mutations in DNA-PKcs or Ku protein have been described in mammals, flies, and yeast, and in each case, the mutant organism is deficient in double strand break repair, sensitive to ionizing radiation, or both (reviewed in Refs. 5Dynan W.S. Yoo S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 1551-1559Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar and 6Chu G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24097-24100Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Binding of DNA-PK components to DNA is believed to be the first step in a repair pathway that involves a number of other gene products (reviewed in Ref. 7Tsukamoto Y. Ikeda H. Genes Cells. 1998; 3: 135-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). It is not clear if the ability of DNA-PK to protect against the cytotoxic effect of ionizing radiation is attributable solely to the mechanical role of the enzyme in DNA repair or whether DNA-PK also participates in antiapoptotic signaling. There have been several reports that DNA-PK physically interacts with signaling molecules, including poly(A)DP-ribose polymerase, IκB, Vav, c-Abl, and certain transcription factors (8Ruscetti T.

In the present study, we investigate the in vivo role of a previously described interaction between DNA-PK and the heat shock transcription factor, HSF1 (12Peterson S.R. Jesch S.A. Chamberlin T.N.

Chem. 1997; 272: 26009-26016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). These prior studies have shown that purified HSF1 binds to both the Ku protein and DNA-PKcs (13Huang J. Nueda A. Yoo S. Dynan W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26009-26016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The binding requires a phylogenetically conserved region of HSF1 that includes amino acids 203–280 and results in a stimulation of DNA-PK phosphorylation activity of up to 20-fold in an in vitroreaction (13Huang J. Nueda A. Yoo S. Dynan W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26009-26016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that DNA-PK may be involved in regulating some aspect of the heat shock response in vivo. Other evidence also suggests an involvement of DNA-PK in the response to heat. Overexpression of human Ku70 in rat cells decreases expression of heat shock protein 70 (hsp70) (14Yang S.H. Nussenzweig A. Li L. Kim D. Ouyang H. Burgman P. Li G.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3799-3806Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 15Li G.C. Yang S.-H. Kim D. Nussenzweig A. Ouyang H. Wei J. Burgman P. Li L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4512-4516Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). It was originally proposed that this might reflect competition of HSF1 and Ku protein for binding to heat shock promoter elements (16Kim D. Ouyang H. Yang S.H. Nussenzweig A. Burgman P. Li G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15277-15284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), although this mechanism has not been supported by later studies (17Giffin W. Kwast-Welfeld J. Rodda D.J. Prefontaine G.G. Traykova-Andonova M. Zhang Y. Weigel N.L. Lefebvre Y.A. Hache R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5647-5658Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Even if the underlying mechanism is unclear, the finding that ectopic expression of a Ku protein subunit perturbs expression of a heat shock protein supports the idea that DNA-PK participates in the heat shock response. It is also known that heat treatment potentiates the cytotoxic effect of ionizing radiation, a phenomenon called thermal radiosensitization (18Robinson J.E. Wizenberg M.J. Acta Radiol. Ther. Phys. Biol. 1974; 13: 241-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 19Ben-Hur E. Elkind M.M. Bronk B.V. Radiation Res. 1974; 58: 38-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar, 20Henle K.J. Leeper D.B. Radiat. Res. 1976; 66: 505-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Interestingly, some cell lines deficient in Ku protein or DNA-PKcs do not show thermal radiosensitization (i.e. their intrinsically high sensitivity to radiation is not further increased by heat) (21Iliakis G. Seaner R. Int. J. Hyperthermia. 1990; 6: 801-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 22O'Hara M. Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys. 1995; 31: 905-910Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). This implicates DNA-PK in the thermal radiosensitization phenomenon. Ku protein may be intrinsically heat-labile (23Burgman P. Ouyang H. Peterson S. Chen D.J. Li G.C. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 2874Google Scholar, 24Matsumoto Y. Suzuki N. Sakai K. Morimatsu A. Hirano K. Mirofushi H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 234: 568-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), in which case heat treatment may reduce double strand break repair. An alternative possibility is that binding of DNA-PK to HSF1 in heat-treated cells competes with its ability to interact with the DNA repair machinery. In the present work, we show that DNA-PK protects against heat-induced apoptosis. Protection is abrogated by introduction of a constitutively expressed HSF1 gene. These studies provide evidence for an antiapoptotic function of DNA-PK that is separable from its role in DNA repair. We find that there are some differences in the time course of induction of hsp70 mRNA and protein in DNA-PK-positive and DNA-PK-negative cells. It is possible that a difference in the state of the transcriptional machinery accounts for the differential heat sensitivity. Alternatively, protection from apoptosis may occur by a nontranscriptional mechanism. For cell culture and clonogenic assays, HeLa, scva2, sc(8)-10, xrs-6cvec, xrs-6cKu80, and AA8 cells were grown at 37 °C with 5% CO2 in minimal essential medium (Life Technologies, Inc.), with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, nonessential amino acids, and 50 μg/ml gentamycin. Medium for sc(8)-10, xrs-6cvec, and xrs-6cKu80 cells contained 400 μg/ml Geneticin. For clonogenic survival assays, cells were heat-treated as indicated in the figure legends and counted. Equal numbers of cells were plated and allowed to grow for 7 days. Colonies were fixed in 5% glutaraldehyde and stained with crystal violet, and colonies of more than 20 cells were counted. For transfection, 107 cells were electroporated in 800 μl of minimal essential medium with 20 μg of expression plasmid and 5 μg of pBabe plasmid, which contains a puromycin selection marker (25Morgernstern J.P. Hartmut L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 3587-3596Crossref PubMed Scopus (1900) Google Scholar). scva2 and sc(8)-10 cells were electroporated at 300 V, 1500 microfarads. xrs-6cKu80 and xrs-6cVec cells were electroporated at 300 V, 2500 microfarads. After transfection, cells were plated in minimal essential medium (without Geneticin). After 24 h, Geneticin (400 μg/ml) and puromycin (3 μg/ml for scva2 and sc(8)-10, 5 μg/ml for xrs-6cVec and xrs-6cKu80 cells) were added. Apoptosis was quantitated by measuring release of histone-DNA fragments into the cytoplasm using a commercial assay (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Briefly, cytoplasmic extracts corresponding to 103 cells were incubated for 2 h in microtiter wells that had been precoated with anti-histone mouse monoclonal antibody (clone H11–4). The wells were washed, and mouse anti-DNA peroxidase-conjugated monoclonal antibody (clone MCA-33) was added. Incubation was continued for 2 h, and the wells were developed with ABTS substrate. Signal was read as the difference between A 405 andA 492. For immunofluorescence, cells were plated on glass coverslips and allowed to grow for 24 h and then heat-treated as indicated in the figure legends. Cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 30 min at room temperature, washed, and incubated for 2 min on ice with a solution containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and 0.1% sodium citrate. Apoptotic death was scored using the TUNEL (TdT-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling) method using fluorescein-dUTP (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) (26Gavrieli Y. Sherman Y. Ben-Sasson S.A. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 493-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (9156) Google Scholar). The cells were washed and incubated for 30 min at room temperature with blocking solution containing 5% nonfat dry milk, 0.9% NaCl, 10 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.2, 0.1% Tween 20, and 0.2% sodium azide. Cells were stained for 1 h each with 1 μg of primary and Texas Red-conjugated secondary antibodies as specified in the figure legends. Cells were washed in PBS containing 1 μg/ml diamidino 2-phenylindole dihydrochloride hydrate (DAPI) (Aldrich) and mounted using 5 μl of mounting medium containing 10% Mowiol (Hoechst), 25% glycerol in 200 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5. To obtain cell extracts, 5–10 × 106 cells were heat-treated as described in the figure legends, washed in PBS, scraped from the plate, suspended in 200 μl of PBS, and lysed by the addition of 200 μl of 2× SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis sample buffer. Equal quantities of protein from each extract were fractionated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride or nitrocellulose membrane by electroblotting in a buffer containing 25 mm Tris base, 192 mm glycine, and 20% methanol. The membrane was blocked in PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and 5% nonfat dry milk and sequentially probed with the primary antibody for 2 h, washed with PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100, probed with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibody, and finally incubated for 5 min with enzyme-catalyzed fluorescence substrate (Vistra ECF Substrate, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) or 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate/nitro blue tetrazolium substrate (Promega). The membrane was dried, and signal was quantitated with a Storm imaging system (Molecular Dynamics, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA). Electrophoretic mobility shift assay was performed as described previously (27Zimarino V. Wu C. Nature. 1987; 327: 727-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Briefly, 5 × 106 cells were heat-treated as indicated in the figure legends, washed with PBS, and lysed in 200 μl of buffer containing 10 mm Pipes, pH 7.9, 0.4 m NaCl, 0.1 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 5% glycerol, and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. For binding, 20 μg (approximately 10 μl) of cell extract was mixed with 10 μg of tRNA, 1 μg of sheared Escherichia coli DNA, 10 μg of poly(dI-dC), and 1 ng of [α-32P]dCTP-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotide in a total volume of 25 μl. The sample was incubated for 15 min at 25 °C and analyzed by nondenaturing gel electrophoresis in 4.5% acrylamide. After electrophoresis, the gel was fixed in 7% acetic acid for 5 min and dried under vacuum, and complexes containing radiolabeled DNA were detected by PhosphorImager analysis. Total RNA was isolated from untreated or heat-treated HeLa, scva2, or sc(8)-10 cells by the guanidine isothiocyanate method, fractionated by formaldehyde-agarose electrophoresis, and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane as described (28Bellón T.

The filter was probed with a cDNA corresponding to the complete sequence of human hsp70D (kindly provided by Dr. Richard I. Morimoto). Nuclear run-on assays were performed as described (29Greenberg M.E. Bender T.A. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. 1. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1997: 4.10.1-4.10.11Google Scholar) with modifications. Nuclei were prepared from 5 × 106cells that were heat-treated as described in the figure legends. Nuclei that had been stored in 200 μl of glycerol storage buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm NaCl, 3 mm MgCl2, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40) were mixed with 200 μl of 2× reaction buffer (10 mm Tris- HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.3 m KCl, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm concentration each of ATP, GTP, and UTP), and 10 ml of [α-32P]CTP (10 μCi/ml) was added to begin the labeling of nascent RNA. The mixture was incubated for 30 min at 30 °C; the reaction was stopped with 540 μl of 0.5 m NaCl, 50 mm MgCl2, 2 mm CaCl2,10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4; and 60 μl of DNase I (1 unit/ml, Promega) were added. A 180-μl aliquot of 5% SDS, 0.5 m Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 0.125 m EDTA and a 20-μl aliquot of 20 mg/ml Proteinase K were added to the reactions, which were then incubated for 30 min at 42 °C. Samples were extracted with phenol/chloroform and precipitated with sodium acetate/ethanol for 20–30 min at −20 °C before centrifugation. The resulting pellet was resuspended in 225 μl of 20 mmHepes, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mmCaCl2, and 25 μl of DNase I (1 unit/ml, Promega), and the mixture was incubated for 20 min at 37 °C. A 10-μl aliquot of 0.5m EDTA, 30 μl of 10% SDS, and a 10-μl aliquot of 20 mg/ml Proteinase K were added, and the mixture was further incubated for 30 min at 30 °C. Samples were extracted with phenol/chloroform and precipitated with ammonium acetate/ethanol. After 2 h at −20 °C, samples were centrifuged, resuspended in 150 μl of TES buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm EDTA, 0.2% SDS), and treated with 40 μl of 1 m NaOH for 10 min at 4 °C. The reactions were stopped by the addition of 75 μl of 1m Hepes, pH 7.8, and precipitated again with NH4OAc and ethanol. Samples were centrifuged, resuspended in 150 μl of TES, heated for 5 min at 90 °C, and added directly to the hybridization solution described below. To prepare membranes for hybridization with the radiolabeled run-on RNA, 20 μg of plasmid DNA were digested with restriction endonucleases. Plasmid containing human β-actin cDNA was digested with EcoRV and ScaI to release the actin structural gene; pT7Zpm70.1, containing the mouse hsp70.1 gene, was digested with HindIII, StuI, andBglII; and pT7hsp27, containing the hamster hsp27 cDNA, was digested with ClaI and BamHI. DNA was fractionated by agarose gel electrophoresis and transferred to a nylon membrane using 0.4 NaOH (30Brown T. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. 1. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1997: 2.9.1-2.10.15Google Scholar). Membrane strips were prehybridized for 2 h at 42 °C in a solution containing 5× SSC, 5× Denhardt's solution, 50% formamide, 1% SDS, and 100 μg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA. Membranes were hybridized for 24 h at 42 °C in 10 ml of the same buffer containing radiolabeled RNA. After hybridization, membranes were washed for 1 h at 42 °C and 1 h at 65 °C in a solution containing 2× SSC and 0.1% SDS. Hybridization of radiolabeled RNA was detected by PhosphorImager analysis. To test whether the heat shock response is abnormal in DNA-PK-deficient cells, we made use of mutant cell lines that lack either DNA-PKcs or Ku80, as listed in TableI. The DNA-PKcs-negative cell line, scva2, derived from a severe combined immunodeficiency (scid) mouse (31Kurimasa A. Nagata Y. Shimizu M. Emi M. Nakamura Y. Oshimura M. Hum.

A matched DNA-PKcs-positive cell line, sc(8)-10, was derived from scva2 by introduction of a centromeric fragment of human chromosome 8 containing the DNA-PKcs structural gene, which rescues radiation resistance and DNA-PK activity (35Peterson S.R.

The Ku80-negative cell line is derived from xrs-6 (36Jeggo P.A. Kemp L.M. Mutat. Res. 1983; 112: 313-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar), a Chinese hamster ovary cell line that has a mutation in the Ku80 structural gene that affects RNA splicing and abolishes Ku80 protein expression (37Singleton B.K.

The xrs-6cKu80 line was derived from xrs-6 by transfection with a human Ku80 cDNA, which rescues Ku protein expression and radiation resistance, and the isogenic xrs-6cvec line was derived by transfection with the same expression vector lacking the Ku80 cDNA (38Chen F. Peterson S.R. Story M.D. Chen D.J. Mutat. Res. 1996; 362: 9-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The unmutated, Ku80-positive, AA8 CHO cell line was also used in some experiments.Table ICell lines used in this studyCell lineSpeciesDNA-PK phenotypescva2MouseNegative; DNA-PKcs-deficientsc(8)-10MousePositivexrs-6cvecHamsterNegative; Ku80-deficientxrs-6cKu80HamsterPositiveAA8HamsterPositive Open table in a new tab Cells were subjected to heat treatment for various times at 43 °C and tested for reproductive viability, i.e. the ability to form colonies in a monolayer cloning assay. The surviving fraction was calculated by counting the number of colonies formed by the heated cells and dividing by the number of colonies formed by unheated control cells plated at the same time. The data reveal a substantial difference in heat sensitivity (Fig. 1). The DNA-PKcs- and Ku80-negative cells (sva2, xrs-6cvec) are up to 30-fold more sensitive to heat-induced cell death than their genetically matched counterparts (sc(8)-10, xrs-6cKu80). The Ku80-negative cells (xrs-6cvec) were also more heat-sensitive than the unmutated AA8 Chinese hamster ovary cell line, although the difference was not as great, perhaps reflecting a level of endogenous Ku protein in AA8 cells that is somewhat lower than in the rescued xrs-6cKu80 cell line. Differences in cell survival were seen at all heat doses. The observed differences in heat sensitivity are of the same magnitude as the differences in ionizing radiation sensitivity previously reported with these cell lines (31Kurimasa A. Nagata Y. Shimizu M. Emi M. Nakamura Y. Oshimura M. Hum. Genet. 1994; 93: 21-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 38Chen F. Peterson S.R. Story M.D. Chen D.J. Mutat. Res. 1996; 362: 9-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). These data indicate that DNA-PK provides substantial protection against heat-induced cell killing under the conditions of these experiments and that both the Ku and DNA-PKcs components are required. Heat-induced cell death can occur by either apoptosis or necrosis, depending on the heat dose and the cell type. At temperatures ranging between 42 and 45 °C, many types of cells die by apoptosis. At higher temperatures, necrosis is the prevalent form of cell death (39Allan D.J. Harmon B.V. Scanning Electron Microsc. 1986; 3: 1121-1133Google Scholar, 40Sellins K.S. Cohen J.J. Radiat.

Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 5459-5464PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether the DNA-PK-deficient cells in our experiments were undergoing cell death by an apoptotic mechanism, we used a quantitative immunoassay to detect release of histone-DNA complexes into the cytoplasm, which is diagnostic of apoptotic death (47Duke R.C. Cohen J.J. Chervenak R. J. Immunol. 1986; 137: 1442-1447PubMed Google Scholar). Heat treatment resulted in an increase in apoptotic complexes in all cell lines. The increase was greater, however, in the DNA-PKcs-negative and Ku80-negative cells, as compared with the matched controls (Fig. 2). For all cell lines, the level of apoptotic histone-DNA complexes reached a maximum within 4 h after heat treatment. This rapid onset of cell death is consistent with results of previous studies using heat-treated cells (45Harmon B.V. Corder A.M. Collins R.J. Gobe G.C. Allen J. Allan D.J. Kerr J.F.R. Int. J. Radiat. Biol. 1990; 58: 845-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar, 46Sakaguchi Y. Stephens L.C. Makino M. Kaneko F. Strebel L. Danhauser L.L. Jenkins G.N. Bull J.M. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 5459-5464PubMed Google Scholar). The difference in the amount of apoptotic histone-DNA complexes measured in DNA-PK-positive and -negative cell populations was on the order of 2-fold. This is a smaller difference than what was seen in the monolayer cloning assay. It is likely that the immunoassay underestimates the differences between cell lines because it measures only complexes recovered from intact cells that remain attached to the culture flask. Many of the DNA-PK-deficient cells disintegrated or detached from the flask prior to harvesting, reducing the amount of apoptotic complexes that were detected. We also used a different assay that allowed us to visualize apoptotic cells individually and thus measure the fraction of apoptotic cells that were present in the population at a given time. In this assay, fluorescein-labeled dUTP was incorporated into the ends of apoptotic DNA fragments by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase and visualized by fluorescence microscopy. The same samples were also stained with the DNA binding dye DAPI to allow visualization of all cells present in the preparation. Heat treatment of DNA-PKcs-negative cells resulted in a marked increase in the fraction of fluorescein-labeled cells, as compared with the unheated control population (Fig. 3). Quantitation showed that the fraction of apoptotic cells in the DNA-PKcs-negative population increased more than 10-fold, whereas there was little change in the fraction of apoptotic cells in the DNA-PKcs-positive population (Fig. 3B). Similar results were obtained in experiments using Ku80-negative and -positive cells and will be presented below. The difference in cell death measured by the immunofluorescence assay (about 10% in scva2 cells) compared with the colony forming assays (99% under similar conditions) may be in part attributed to inherent underestimation by the immunofluorescence method, because only cells that are undergoing apoptosis at a single time point are scored. Some apoptotic cells may float away before they can be fixed and detected, and others may be destined to undergo apoptosis at later times and also escape detection. By contrast, the colony forming assay provides a measure of cumulative death in the entire population. In addition, the colony formation assay scores cells that do not undergo apoptosis but nevertheless lose reproductive viability. The preceding experiments establish that DNA-PK protects cells against heat-induced apoptosis. We wished to determine whether this protection was modulated by HSF1. Previous studies have shown that HSF1 binds to and regulates DNA-PK in vitro (12Peterson S.R. Jesch S.A. Chamberlin T.N. Dvir A. Rabindran S.K. Wu C. Dynan W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1449-1454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 13Huang J. Nueda A. Yoo S. Dynan W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26009-26016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). If overexpression of wild-type or mutant HSF1 could be shown to affect DNA-PK-mediated protection against heat-induced apoptosis, this would be evidence for a regulatory interaction between these proteins in vivo. Accordingly, we established populations of transfected cells expressing HSF1 derivatives in a Ku80-positive and -negative background. A map of the HSF1 derivatives used in this experiment is shown in Fig. 4A. All of these derivatives form trimers and bind to DNA in vitro (13Huang J. Nueda A. Yoo S. Dynan W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26009-26016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). They differ in their ability to interact with DNA-PK. HSF1-(1–450), which contains the first 450 of the 529 amino acids of human HSF1, binds strongly to DNA-PK components in vitro and stimulates DNA-PK activity (13Huang J. Nueda A. Yoo S. Dynan W.S. J.

Major conformational rearrangements are observed in the extreme states although they are more substantial in NiR-Pd. The four structures differ significantly in the c heme domains. Upon reduction, a His17/Met106 heme-ligand switch is observed in NiR-Pd together with concerted movements of the Tyr in the distal site of the d1 heme (Tyr10 in NiR-Pa, Tyr25 in NiR-Pd) and of a loop of the c heme domain (56–62 in NiR-Pa, 99–116 in NiR-Pd). Whether the reduction of the c heme, which undergoes the major rearrangements, is the trigger of these movements is the question addressed by our study. This conformational reorganization is not observed in the partially reduced species, in which the c heme is partially or largely (15–90%) reduced but the d1 heme is still oxidized. These results suggest that the d1 heme reduction is likely to be responsible of the movements. We speculate about the mechanistic explanation as to why the opening of the d1 heme distal pocket only occurs upon electron transfer to the d1 heme itself, to allow binding of the physiological substrate NO2−exclusively to the reduced metal center.

The biological reactions involved in denitrification are not yet completely understood at the molecular level. Bacteria, likePseudomonas, Paracoccus, or Desulfovibrio, can grow on nitrate as sole nitrogen source and can use nitrate as terminal electron acceptor under anaerobic growth conditions (5Averill B.A. Chem. Rev. 1996; 96: 2951-2964Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). Four elementary steps take place for the reduction of nitrate to N2, catalyzed by nitrate, nitrite, nitric oxide, and nitrous oxide reductase, respectively (6Zumft W.G. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1997; 61: 533-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (2799) Google Scholar).

NiR-Pa is purified from the periplasmic space as an homodimer of 120 kDa, carrying one c heme and one d1 heme per subunit. The c heme is reduced first and the d1 heme is the site of reduction of oxygen (7Shimada H. Orii Y. J. Biochem. 1976; 80: 135-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 8Greenwood C. Barber D.

Tyr10 is hydrogen-bonded by the OH side chain to a hydroxide ion that is the sixth ligand of the d1 heme iron and hinders the access of the catalytic site to the substrate. In NiR from Paracoccus denitrificans GB17 (NiR-Pd) on the other hand, the c heme has an unusual His17-His69coordination in the oxidized state; moreover, the “domain swapping” is absent and Tyr25 of the c domain of the same monomer directly coordinates the d1 heme iron (1Fülöp V. Moir J.W.B. Ferguson S.J. Hajdu J. Cell. 1995; 81: 369-377Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Very unusual in the field of redox proteins, the NiR conformation largely depends on the redox state of the protein, and major changes in the structural organization were found to occur upon reduction. The structure of reduced NiR-Pd recently published (2Williams P.A. Fülöp V. Garman E.F. Saunders N.F.W. Ferguson S.J. Hajdu J. Nature. 1997; 389: 406-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar) shows large rearrangements at the level of the c domain: the N-terminal arm from 26 (or 36) back is disordered after reduction, and in particular Tyr25, a ligand of the d1 heme Fe(III) is pushed out of the site upon reduction. Moreover, His17, one of the two c heme ligands, is replaced by Met106 brought in by the significant movement (15–17 Å) of the loop (99–116). In the structure of the reduced NiR-Pa (NiR-red) (4Nurizzo D. Cutruzzolà F. Arese M. Bourgeois D. Brunori M. Cambillau C. Tegoni M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 13987-13996Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), the rearrangements are of smaller amplitude and consist of coordinated movements (Fig. 1): (i) a 6 Å rocking movement of the loop (56–62) toward the c heme, likely stabilized by the formation of new hydrogen bonds between Thr59 and Gln11 and between Ala58 and Gly60, in the middle of this loop, which tightens the loop in the reduced form; (ii) the rotation of Tyr10 (4.2 Å) and the disappearance of the hydroxide ion coordinating the d1 heme iron, which make the d1 heme site accessible to the substrate. These movements are independent of the presence of NO at the active site (4Nurizzo D. Cutruzzolà F. Arese M. Bourgeois D. Brunori M. Cambillau C. Tegoni M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 13987-13996Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Because an identical movement of Tyr10 was also present when the d1 heme was incompletely reduced, we proposed (4Nurizzo D. Cutruzzolà F. Arese M. Bourgeois D. Brunori M. Cambillau C. Tegoni M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 13987-13996Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) that the loop (56–62) displacement occurs upon reduction of the c heme and triggers a cascade of movements. In the present paper, we directly address the question of whether these conformational changes are visible in an enzyme having the d1 heme oxidized while the c heme is already reduced. With this aim, we have investigated the x-ray structure of NiR-Pa at different discrete levels of c heme reduction, all having the d1 heme oxidized. This experiment has taken advantage of the slow intramolecular electron transfer from c heme to d1heme in NiR-Pa, which has been already characterized in solution and confirmed here in the crystalline state. The partially reduced forms of NiR-Pa were obtained by soaking the oxidized crystals in the presence of ascorbate as reducing agent and by cryoquenching the reaction at different times. The redox state of the enzyme was assessed by microspectrophotometry and the potential structural rearrangements being analyzed by the x-ray method. The protein used for the crystallization was purified following the method by Parr (13Parr S.R. Barber D. Greenwood C. Phillips B.W. Melling J. Biochem. J. 1976; 157: 423-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). It had the expected absorbance ratio in the oxidized state (A 640 nm/A 520 nm≥ 1.0, A 411 nm/A 280 nm≥ 1.2) and showed a single SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis band. The crystallization conditions were described previously (3Nurizzo D. Silvestrini M.C. Mathieu M. Cutruzzolà F. Bourgeois D. Fülöp V. Hajdu J. Brunori M. Tegoni M. Cambillau C.

Orthorhombic crystals (P21212) were obtained in 2 m Na/K2-phosphate, 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.4, and had cell parameters of (163.1 × 90.1 × 111.9) Å (3Nurizzo D. Silvestrini M.C. Mathieu M. Cutruzzolà F. Bourgeois D. Fülöp V. Hajdu J. Brunori M. Tegoni M. Cambillau C. Structure. 1997; 5: 1157-1171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Oxidized crystals were soaked in a solution containing 25 or 50 mm Na-ascorbate in 2 mNa/K2-phosphate and 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2. Crystals NiR-15 and NiR-50 were soaked in 25 mmNa-ascorbate for 6 and 30 min, respectively; whereas crystal NiR-90 was soaked in 50 mm Na-ascorbate for 7 min. After soaking, the crystals were transferred for a few seconds to solutions containing 15% glycerol. All the solutions were previously saturated with argon. In the microspectrophotometric experiments, care was taken to record optical densities in the range of linearity (OD ≤ 2.5). The ORIEL microspectrophotometer mounted on the ID09 beamline at the ESRF consisted of a xenon lamp source and a CCD detector. The spectra were recorded with unpolarized light. The dark current corresponding to the electric noise was measured, and the base-line correction was performed with a buffer similar to that in which the crystals were soaked. The crystals were taken from the soaking solution, mounted on a cryoloop, and frozen in a cold stream of nitrogen gas. The cryoloop put on the goniometer head was maintained at 100 K by a nitrogen cryostream (Oxford Cryosystems). Spectral processing (smoothing, displaying, and page setting) was performed with the IDL5.1 (Research System, Inc.) and Xmgr3.01 (ACE/gr Development Team) software. The spectra of the frozen crystals were normalized at 541 nm, the isosbestic point in the transition between the oxidized and the reduced form. On the normalized spectra, we calculated the percentage of reduction of the c heme as the ratio of ΔOD to the maximum ΔOD observed between the totally oxidized and the totally reduced form at 545 and 551 nm in the α band of the c heme, where the spectral contribution of the d1 heme is negligible compared with that of the c heme. Three crystals (NiR-15, NiR-50, and NiR-90) at 15, 50, and 90% reduction of the c heme, respectively, were selected for x-ray data collection. A control spectrum was recorded after the exposure of the intermediate crystal at 50% c heme reduction. This spectrum was not significantly different from that taken before exposure to x-rays. X-ray data of NiR-15, NiR-50, and NiR-90 were collected at the ID14 beamline at the ESRF (Grenoble, France) on a MarCCD detector, using a 0.933-Å wavelength. A crystal to detector distance of 165 mm was chosen to avoid spot overlap as much as possible. Data sets were indexed and integrated with DENZO (14Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Sawyer L. Isaacs N.W.

To accurately compare with the NiR-red model, which had been refined between 12.0 and 2.90 Å (4Nurizzo D. Cutruzzolà F. Arese M. Bourgeois D. Brunori M. Cambillau C. Tegoni M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 13987-13996Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), the refinement of NiR-15, NiR-50, and NiR-90 was performed using the same resolution range between 12.0 and 2.90 Å. Moreover, the same reflection set was used for the calculation of theR free, and an identical refinement procedure was performed on all models and data sets (NiR-15, NiR-50, NiR-90, and NiR-red). After several cycles of the rigid-body refinement procedure in X-PLOR3.8 (17Brunger A.T. Kuriyan J. Karplus M. Science. 1987; 235: 458-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (2125) Google Scholar, 18Brunger A.T. X-PLOR Manual. Yale University, New Haven, CT1996Google Scholar), the two domains of each monomer were satisfactorily fitted. At this stage, we calculated the first sigmaA weighted maps (2mFo-DFc, difference Fourier with reduced model bias) and (mFo-DFc) (19Read R.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. A. 1986; 42: 140-149Crossref Scopus (2035) Google Scholar) (Figs. 3, A–C and 4A). The refinement, including some conjugate gradient and B-factors refinement cycles in X-PLOR3.8, was alternated with visual inspection on the display, permitting the final model to be obtained. The refinement and stereochemical data are given in Table I, in which the statistics show the good quality of the models despite the absence of water molecules. The coordinates have been deposited at the Protein Data Bank with codes 1N15, 1N50, and 1N90, respectively for the NiR-15, NiR-50, and NiR-90 models and data sets. The r.m.s. deviations were calculated with the LSQMAN program (20Kleywegt G.J. Jones T.A. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 277: 525-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar).

Cutruzzolà F. Arese M. Bourgeois D. Brunori M. Cambillau C. Tegoni M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 13987-13996Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). After the addition of ascorbate to the mother liquor bathing the crystal of NiR-ox, spectra between 700 and 400 nm were recorded. Upon reduction, the Soret band maximum shifted from 411 to 417 nm (not shown) and the α and β bands of the c heme become resolved; the maximum of the d1 heme α band shifted from 640 to 650 nm. The crystals spectra, well resolved at low temperature, show the α band of the c heme split in two peaks at 545 and 551 nm and the β band centered at 519 nm and flanked by two shoulders at 510 and 525 nm (Fig. 2). When the crystals of oxidized NiR-Pa are exposed to Na-ascorbate 50 mm, the reduction of the c heme is fast and almost complete in a few minutes, whereas the α band of the d1 heme starts shifting toward 650 nm only after several minutes (≈10′ at room temperature). On the basis of the reduction time course observed in the crystal, it seemed feasible to obtain crystals in which the d1 heme is oxidized and the c heme is at intermediate levels of reduction. We have then selected discrete times at which the reaction was stopped by freeze-quenching the crystals. The redox state of NiR-Pa in the frozen crystals was checked by microspectrophotometry before the x-rays collection (Fig. 2); in particular, after having recorded and normalized the spectra at 541 nm, we calculated the approximate proportion of the c heme in the reduced state. The spectra in Fig. 2correspond to crystals in which the c heme is approximately at 15, 50, and 90% reduced. In all these spectra, within experimental error limits, the α band of the d1 heme is superimposable to that of the oxidized enzyme, showing that the d1 heme remains oxidized throughout the reduction of the c heme. The crystals at various percentage of the reduced c heme were suitable for x-ray data collection and diffracted at the maximum resolution of 2.70 Å, which is lower than that of the oxidized enzyme (2.15 Å) (3Nurizzo D. Silvestrini M.C. Mathieu M. Cutruzzolà F. Bourgeois D. Fülöp V. Hajdu J. Brunori M. Tegoni M. Cambillau C. Structure. 1997; 5: 1157-1171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) but comparable with that of the unliganded reduced enzyme (2.90 Å) (4Nurizzo D. Cutruzzolà F. Arese M. Bourgeois D. Brunori M. Cambillau C. Tegoni M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 13987-13996Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). After the rigid body refinement procedure using NiR-ox as a starting model and the data sets of NiR-15, NiR-50, and NiR-90, and NiR-red crystals, we calculated the first sigmaA maps (2mFo-DFc and mFo-DFc) (Figs.3, a–c and4a). We focused our attention on the regions near the prosthetic groups where the wider structural rearrangements had been observed in going from NiR-ox to NiR-red model (4Nurizzo D. Cutruzzolà F. Arese M. Bourgeois D. Brunori M. Cambillau C. Tegoni M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 13987-13996Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). At partial reduction of the c heme, the (2mFo-DFc) maps are always clearly defined and fit well the oxidized conformation (Fig. 3, a–c). The conformation of the residues involved in the movements (loop 56–62 and Tyr10) is superimposable to that of NiR-ox. A peak in the Fourier difference map is observed in between the two propionates of the d1 heme (Figs. 3,a–c and 4a), which was successfully modeled with a water molecule in the NiR-ox model (W564 and W65, in subunit A and B, respectively). Moreover, one additional Fourier difference peak is observed between the iron atom of the d1 heme and the OH side chain of Tyr10, with a shape comparable with that observed in the NiR-ox structure at the same resolution and identified there as an OH− ion (Fig. 3, A–C). No other peaks are visible in the Fourier difference map, which accounts for the good quality of the (2mFo-DFc) map. The presence of the OH− strengthens the identity between the partially reduced forms (NiR-15, NiR-50, and NiR-90) and the NiR-ox model. To truly estimate whether the absence of differences with the NiR-ox structure is significant at the same stage of refinement,i.e. after the rigid body refinement procedure, we have calculated sigmaA maps (2mFo-DFc and mFo-DFc) with NiR-ox as a starting model and the data set of NiR-red (Fig. 4a). In this case, the oxidized conformation does not fit the (2mFo-DFc) density map. The clear (mFo-DFc) and (2mFo-DFc) maps appear showing the new tracing of the loop 56–62 that corresponds to the reduced conformation. Moreover, a peak in the mFo-DFc map appeared on the side of Tyr10, likely indicating a displaced conformation of the side chain (Fig. 4a). A Fourier difference peak is also observed near the d1 heme but it is located between the proximal ligand His182 and the iron atom of the d1 heme, far from the position of the OH− in NiR-ox. This peak is likely because of a misorientation of the His182 side chain before refinement of the model. Indeed, after refinement by gradient minimization and B-factor refinement, this difference peak has disappeared, and the whole model has slightly moved around this position. Both the loop 56–62 and the region of Tyr10 have been rebuilt. After refinement, the new tracing corresponding to the reduced conformation fit well into the density (Fig. 4b). In the final model, two new hydrogen bonds are present between Thr59 and Gln11, and Ala58 and Gly60, and a significant displacement of the loop 56–62 and Tyr10 with respect to the NiR-ox model can be observed. The structures of partially reduced enzymes were superimposed on that of the oxidized and of the reduced NiR-Pa, taking into account for the r.m.s. calculation the backbone atoms of the d1 heme domains. Based on this superimposition, the r.m.s. deviations were calculated, and the results are presented in Tables II and III. The deviations to NiR-ox are in the range 0.32–0.56 Å; conversely those to NiR-red are 0.49–1.07 Å, values that are much closer to the 0.69–1.24 Å found for the difference between NiR-red and NiR-ox. By taking into account only the residues involved in the conformational change, in the active site and the ligands of the c and d1heme groups, the r.m.s. deviations of the partially reduced heme c forms versus NiR-ox are in the range 0.25–0.42, which is significantly different from the 1.4–1.7 found versusNiR-red and for NiR-red versus NiR-ox (Table III). This comparison strengthens the identity of the partially reduced c heme forms to NiR-ox model.Table IIThe r.m.s. deviation for the c heme domain (residues 30–115) and the d1 heme domain (residues 150–536) calculated on the backbone atoms of partially reduced NiRs (15, 60, and 90% c heme reduced) and the fully reduced c heme, and NiR-ox or NiR-red, respectively, after superimposition of the d1 heme domain of monomer A.15%50%90%NiR-redNiR-oxc Heme domainMonomer A0.330.400.401.24Monomer B0.320.370.560.95d1 Heme domainMonomer A0.150.150.160.21Monomer B0.330.400.440.69NiR-redc heme domainMonomer A1.071.051.05Monomer B0.880.870.86d1 heme domainMonomer A0.170.170.18Monomer B0.490.490.57 Open table in a new tab Table IIIThe r.m.s. deviation of the atoms (258 non-hydrogen atoms) of the residues involved in the conformational change, in the active site and ligand of the c and d1 heme (residues 9–13, 54–64, His327 and His369, His51, Met88, His182, c heme and d1 heme) of partially reduced NiRs (15, 50, and 90% c heme reduced) and the fully reduced c heme, and NiR-ox or NiR-red, respectively, after superimposition of the d1 heme domain of monomer A15%50%90%NiR-redNiR-oxActive siteMonomer A0.250.290.291.74Monomer B0.290.340.421.48NiR-redActive siteMonomer A1.651.641.65Monomer B1.441.441.44 Open table in a new tab The present results on the reduction of crystalline NiR-Pa by ascorbate are qualitatively in agreement with the characterization of the reduction reaction previously carried out in solution in the presence of reduced azurin, in which the c heme is reduced more rapidly with a rate constant value k 1 = 28 s−1 at room temperature (22Cutruzzolà F. Arese M. Grasso S. Bellelli A. Brunori M. FEBS Lett. 1997; 412: 365-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), whereas the intramolecular electron transfer is 35-fold slower in the absence of an external ligand acting as an electron acceptor (23Parr S.R. Barber D. Greenwood C. Brunori M. Biochem. J. 1977; 167: 447-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 22Cutruzzolà F. Arese M. Grasso S. Bellelli A. Brunori M. FEBS Lett. 1997; 412: 365-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). A faster intramolecular electron transfer was detected in the reaction with O2, where the c heme is oxidized at a rate constantk 2 ≥ 100 s−1 (8Greenwood C. Barber D. Parr S.R. Antonini E. Brunori M. Colosimo A. Biochem. J. 1978; 173: 11-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The quantification of the reduction kinetics in the crystal would demand a complete characterization of the reaction time course, which has not been carried out because it was not the primary motivation of the present study; our goal was to produce and freeze NiR-Pa crystals at different levels of reduction of the c heme to estimate the sequence of structural events involving the d1 heme active site. NiR-Pd crystals have previously been characterized by time-resolved microspectrophotometry during the reduction by dithionite and the reoxidation by nitrite (2Williams P.A. Fülöp V. Garman E.F. Saunders N.F.W. Ferguson S.J. Hajdu J. Nature. 1997; 389: 406-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). An accurate analysis of the spectra published in Williams et al (2Williams P.A. Fülöp V. Garman E.F. Saunders N.F.W. Ferguson S.J. Hajdu J. Nature. 1997; 389: 406-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar) indicates that, in contrast to the reaction of ascorbate with NiR-Pa, no significant lag was detected between the reduction of the c and the d1 heme. Indeed, a fast intramolecular process has also been observed in a pulse radiolysis study of NiR-Pd in solution; the rate constant of 1400 s−1 at pH 7.0 and room temperature was assigned to the electron transfer from the c heme to the d1 heme (25Kobayashi K. Koppenhöfer A. Ferguson S.J. Tagawa S. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 13611-13616Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The x-ray data presented above on the intermediate oxidation states of NiR-Pa indicate that the structural modification at the level of the c and the d1 heme observed in going to the fully reduced NiR-red are absent in the partially reduced NiR-15, NiR-50, and NiR-90 models. In light of these results, and in contrast with our previous hypothesis suggesting that the loop 56–62 might move upon reduction of the c heme and trigger the concerted movements at the level of the d1 active site (4Nurizzo D. Cutruzzolà F. Arese M. Bourgeois D. Brunori M. Cambillau C. Tegoni M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 13987-13996Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), our present interpretation is that the reduction of the c heme by itself does not trigger the movements of the loop 56–62 and of Tyr10; these conformational changes appear therefore to be a consequence of additional events in the reduction process that are likely to be the electron transfer to the d1 heme iron. From the results in the literature and our studies, the catalytic cycle of NiR-Pa can be summarized by the following SchemeFS1. For step 1, [1]→[2], the c heme of the c-ox/d1-ox form is rapidly reduced by the electron donor cytochromec 551 leading to the c-red/d1-ox form. The preference of this electron donor for the c heme can originate for two reasons: either the potential of the c-heme is more positive than that of the d1 heme (26Blatt Y. Pecht I. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 2917-2922Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) or the c heme is more accessible than the d1 heme (27Schichman S.A. Gray H.B. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1981; 103: 7794-7795Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The latter is confirmed by the three-dimensional structure of NiR-Pa. For step 2, [2]→[3]→[4], the c-red/d1-ox form goes through a step involving electron transfer and coupled conformational changes, although the transient c-ox/d1-red form was not isolated, being immediately followed by the c-red/d1-red form in the presence of excess reductant. The step [2]→[3] is slow and might be limited by a slow electron transfer or a slow conformational change involving a reorganization of the coordination site. The d1 heme reduction might be the trigger of the conformational change. As it is generally agreed that the affinity of oxygenated ligands is much greater for Fe(III) than for Fe(II) (28Holmes M.A. Le Trong I. Turley S. Sieker L.C. Stenkamp R.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 218: 583-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar), addition of one electron at the Fe center of d1 heme (its reduction) might weaken the Fe-OH− bond and provoke the release of the hydroxide ion. This would then induce a series of conformational changes involving the displacement of Tyr10, likely attracted by the His369 to which it is hydrogen-bonded (2.7 Å in NiR-ox), coupled to the motion of the loop 56–62 of the c domain. In line with this hypothesis, in mutants of sperm whale myoglobin in which the distal His64 had been changed to Tyr, the coordination bond between the OH of Tyr and the Fe was weakened or abolished upon reduction (29Egeberg K.D. Springer B.A. Martinis S.A. Sligar S.G. Morikis D. Champion P.M. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 9783-9791Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Alternatively a redox state-dependent change of the pK of His369 might be responsible for a shortening of the hydrogen bond between this residue and Tyr10 (2.7 Å in NiR-ox) and a weakening of the Tyr10-OH− ion hydrogen bond. Indeed, the subunit B of the unliganded NiR-red (4Nurizzo D. Cutruzzolà F. Arese M. Bourgeois D. Brunori M. Cambillau C. Tegoni M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 13987-13996Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), where the d1 heme is partly oxidized, presents a conformation close to that proposed above because the Tyr10 is in the rotated position, with the OH at 3.45 Å from the Nε2 of His369, and the Fe(III), as we proposed (4Nurizzo D. Cutruzzolà F. Arese M. Bourgeois D. Brunori M. Cambillau C. Tegoni M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 13987-13996Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), is coordinated to an hydroxide ion. In accord with this second hypothesis, in the H64Y mutant of sperm whale myoglobin, a pK of 5.6 for Tyr64-OH has been suggested to depend on the close proximity of basic residues (30Pin S. Alpert B. Cortès R. Ascone I. Chiu M.L. Sligar S.G. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 11618-11623Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). However, for NiR-Pa an altered kinetic behavior would have been expected for the mutants Y10F and Y10N, in which the hydrogen bond to the hydroxide should not be formed (22Cutruzzolà F. Arese M. Grasso S. Bellelli A. Brunori M. FEBS Lett. 1997; 412: 365-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). For step 3, [4]→[5]→[2], the c-red/d1-red form binds nitrite and reduces it to nitric oxide. In the process, the d1 heme becomes oxidized. At low pH, the affinity of the d1-oxidized heme for NO is low (≤ 1 mm) (9Silvestrini M.C. Colosimo A. Brunori M. Walsh T.A. Barber D. Greenwood C. Biochem. J. 1979; 183: 701-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), and NO is therefore released ([5]→[2]), leading to the c-red/d1-ox free enzyme, ready to initiate the next cycle. When the pH is basic, NO remains bound to the c-red/d1-ox enzyme long enough to lead in the presence of reductants to the stable c-red/d1-red-NO form which is inactive and essentially “trapped” (10Silvestrini M.C. Tordi M.G. Musci G. Brunori M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11783-11787Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The protonation state of the active site histidine(s) (His369 and His327) might be responsible of the high affinity of NO for the enzyme at basic pH. An intriguing question is why a conformational change occurs during catalysis. It is first of all clear that the structure of the reduced enzymes from NiR-Pa and NiR-Pd are very similar at the level of the c heme, including the conformation of the loop 55–60. This conformation is also that found in cytochromes c and should therefore be rather stable. The role of the conformational change of this loop in catalysis remains unclear but might suggest that prevention of a free access of ligands to the d1 active site is necessary. Indeed, the Tyr movement might help the opening of the d1 active site at the proper step in catalysis when the reduced d1 heme should bind the physiological substrate NO2− and avoid the formation of catalytically incompetent complexes, like Fe(III)-NO2−. The presence of this conformational change at the d1 heme active site might be explained by the need of populating a “resting state” in these enzymes to make the d1 heme inaccessible. In both these enzymes, the inaccessibility of the heme Fe in the d1 site might be assured either by direct coordination of Tyr25 in NiR-Pd or by the intervention of OH−/Tyr10 in NiR-Pa. Some analogies in the structure of NiR active site and eukaryote cytochrome coxidase might be envisaged, as in both cases a Tyr stabilizes an oxygenated ligand (OH− and O2) coordinated at the Fe of the heme (d1 and a3) (24Yoshikawa S. Shinzawa-Itoh K. Nakashima R. Yaono R. Yamashita E. Inoue N. Yao M. Jie Fei M. Libeu C.P. Mizushima T. Yamaguchi H. Tomizaki T. Tsukihara T. Science. 1998; 280: 1723-1729Crossref PubMed Scopus (959) Google Scholar). In cytochrome oxidase, nevertheless, it seems that the protonation state of the Tyr triggers the shift to a catalytically active state of the enzyme, whereas in NiR the role of Tyr seems to protect the active site when the enzyme does not turn over and is, in this respect, somewhat analogous to the CuB of cytochrome coxidase."
https://openalex.org/W1970119314,"The amphiphilic peptide mastoparan, isolated from wasp venom, is a potent inhibitor of the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase. At pH 7.2, ATPase activity is inhibited with an inhibitory constant (K i) of 1 ± 0.13 μm. Mastoparan shifts the E2-E1 equilibrium toward E1 and may affect the regulatory ATP binding site. The peptide also decreases the affinity of the ATPase for Ca2+ and abolishes the cooperativity of Ca2+ binding. In the presence of mastoparan, the two Ca2+ ions bind independently of one another. Our results appear to support the model that describes the relationship between the two Ca2+ binding sites as “side-by-side,” because this model allows the possibility of independent Ca2+ entry to the two sites. Mastoparan shifts the steady-state equilibrium between E1′Ca2 and E1′Ca2·P toward E1′Ca2·P, by possibly affecting the conformational change that follows ATP binding. The peptide also causes a reduction in the levels of phosphoenzyme formed from [32P]Pi.Some analogues of mastoparan were also tested and were found to cause inhibition of the Ca2+-ATPase in the range of 2–4 μm.

The sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase transports Ca2+ from the cytosol to the lumen of the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) 1The abbreviations used are: SR, sarcoplasmic reticulum; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; FITC, fluorescein 5′-isothiocyanate; NBD, nitrobenzo-2-oxa-1,3-diazole; TNP-ADP, trinitrophenyl adenosine diphosphate; MP, mastoparan; Mops, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; Mes, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid. 1The abbreviations used are: SR, sarcoplasmic reticulum; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; FITC, fluorescein 5′-isothiocyanate; NBD, nitrobenzo-2-oxa-1,3-diazole; TNP-ADP, trinitrophenyl adenosine diphosphate; MP, mastoparan; Mops, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; Mes, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid./endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The mechanism of this Ca2+-ATPase is usually discussed in terms of the model proposed by de Meis and Vianna (1de Meis L. Vianna A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1979; 48: 275-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar). The model postulates two major conformational states of the enzyme, E1 and E2. These two states differ in that the affinity for Ca2+is high in the E1 conformation but low in the E2 conformation, and the Ca2+-binding sites are exposed on the cytoplasmic side of the SR in E1 but exposed to the lumen in E2. It has been demonstrated that the binding of Ca2+ to the ATPase is both sequential and co-operative (2Inesi G. Kurzmack M. Coan C. Lewis D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 3025-3031Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This suggests that binding of the first Ca2+ ion is followed by a slow conformational change (E1Ca → E1′Ca), which allows binding of the second Ca2+ ion. The second site is only formed on transition to E1′Ca (2Inesi G. Kurzmack M. Coan C. Lewis D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 3025-3031Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The Ca2+-ATPase belongs to a family of enzymes known as the P2-type ATPases (3Lutsenko S. Kaplan J.H. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 15607-15613Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). Several peptide toxins have been shown to inhibit the action of these enzymes. Both myotoxin a, from rattle snake venom, and melittin, isolated from bee venom, are basic peptides that inhibit the SR Ca2+-ATPase (4Baker K.J. East J.M Lee A.G. Biochem.

Yoshida H. Nakajima T. Chem. Pharm. Bull. 1979; 27: 1942-1944Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). It is known to possess a variety of biological activities including mast cell degranulation, mobilization of Ca2+from cerebellar microsomes and sarcoplasmic reticulum, activation of the ryanodine receptor and modulation of various enzymes, for example the Na+/K+-ATPase of rat brain (12Hirai Y. Ueno Y. Yasuhara T. Yoshida H. Nakajima T. Biomed. Res. 1980; 1: 185-197Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 13Longland C.L. Mezna M. Langel Ü. Hällbrink M. Soomets U. Wheatley M. Michelangeli F.

Pept. 1996; 62: 47-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In aqueous solutions, mastoparan forms a random structure, however, in a lipid environment, the peptide adopts an amphiphilic α-helical structure, which is thought to be crucial for its interaction with biological membranes (15Higashijima T. Burnier J. Ross E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14176-14186Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In a previous study (13Longland C.L. Mezna M. Langel Ü. Hällbrink M. Soomets U. Wheatley M. Michelangeli F. Howl J. Cell Calcium. 1998; 24: 27-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), we showed that mastoparan and a number of closely related analogues inhibit the SR Ca2+-ATPase. Here we elucidate the mechanism of this inhibition. Mastoparan (MP), mastoparan X (MPX), mastoparan 7 (MP7), and mastoparan 17 (MP17) were all obtained from Bachem.45CaCl2, [3H]glucose, [γ-32P]ATP and [32P]Pi were obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. All other reagents were purchased from Sigma. SR and the purified Ca2+-ATPase were prepared from rabbit fast-twitch skeletal muscle as described by Michelangeli and Munkonge (16Michelangeli F. Munkonge F. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 194: 231-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Ca2+-ATPase activities were determined using the coupled enzyme method described by Michelangeli and Munkonge (16Michelangeli F. Munkonge F. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 194: 231-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) and monitored in a buffer containing 40 mm Hepes/KOH (pH 7.2), 1 mm EGTA, 5 mm MgSO4, 2 mm ATP, 0.42 mm phosphoenolpyruvate, 0.15 mm NADH, 7.5 IU of pyruvate kinase, and 18 IU of lactate dehydrogenase. Ca2+-ATPase (15 μg) was incubated for 10 min at 37 °C in 2.5 ml of assay buffer. ATPase activity was initiated by the addition of 1 mm CaCl2 to give a free Ca2+ concentration of 6.5 μm. The Ca2+-ATPase/SR was labeled with nitrobenzo-2-oxa-1,3-diazole (NBD) as described by Henderson et al. (17Henderson I.M.J. Khan Y.M. East J.M. Lee A.G. Biochem. J. 1994; 297: 615-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The Ca2+-ATPase was labeled with fluorescein 5′-isothiocyanate (FITC) at a ratio of FITC to ATPase of 0.5:1 according to the method of Michelangeli et al. (18Michelangeli F. Orlowski S. Champeil P. East J.M. Lee A.G. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 3090-3101Google Scholar). Fluorescence measurements were performed at 25 °C using a Perkin-Elmer LS-50B fluorimeter. Measurements of NBD fluorescence were made at excitation and emission wavelengths of 430 and 510 nm, respectively, in a buffer containing either 150 mmMops/Tris, 0.3 mm EGTA, 100 mm choline chloride at pH 7.2, or 150 mm Mes/Tris, 0.3 mm EGTA, 100 mm choline chloride at pH 6.0. Tryptophan fluorescence was monitored by exciting at 295 nm and measuring the emission at 330 nm. These measurements were made in a buffer containing 20 mmHepes/Tris, 100 mm KCl, 5 mm MgSO4, 100 μm Ca2+ at pH 7.2. Rapid kinetic fluorescence measurements were performed using a stopped-flow spectrofluorimeter (Applied Photophysics, Model SX17 MV). The sample handling unit possesses two syringes, A and B (drive ratio 10:1), which are driven by a pneumatic ram. Tryptophan fluorescence was monitored (at 25 °C) by exciting the sample at 280 nm and measuring the emission above 320 nm using a cut off filter. Ca2+binding was measured at pH 7.2 in 20 mm Hepes/Tris, 100 mm KCl, 5 mm MgSO4, 50 μm EGTA, plus 1 mm Ca2+ from syringe B, whereas Ca2+ dissociation was measured at pH 7.2 in 20 mm Hepes/Tris, 100 mm KCl, 5 mm MgSO4, 100 μmCa2+, plus 2 mm EGTA from syringe B, all values being final concentration. Ca2+ binding to the ATPase was measured using the dual labeling technique of Michelangeli et al. (19Michelangeli F. Orlowski S. Champeil P. Grimes E.A. East J.M. Lee A.G. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 8307-8312Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). ATPase (0.1 mg) was incubated at 25 °C in 1 ml of buffer containing 20 mm Hepes/Tris, 100 mm KCl, 5 mmMgSO4, 100 μm EGTA, 500 μm[3H]glucose (0.2 Ci/mol) and45CaCl2 (3 Ci/mol) to give the required free Ca2+ concentration at pH 7.2. Samples were then rapidly filtered through Millipore HAWP filters (0.45 μm). Filters were left to dry, after which 8 ml of scintillant was added. The filters were then counted for both 3H and45Ca2+. The amount of [3H]glucose trapped on each filter was used to calculate the wetting volume for the filter, and the amount of Ca2+ trapped in this volume was subtracted from the total Ca2+ bound to the filter to give that bound to the ATPase. A correction was also applied for nonspecific binding of Ca2+ to the filter. Equilibrium levels of phosphorylation of the ATPase by [32P]Pi were measured in 150 mmMes/Tris (pH 6.2), containing 5 mm EGTA, 10 mmMgSO4, and 1 mm Pi (10 Ci/mol), at 25 °C and a protein concentration of 0.9 mg/ml. Samples were incubated for 20 s and then quenched with 10% trichloroacetic acid, 0.2 m H3PO4. The precipitate was collected by rapid filtration through Whatman GF/C filters, washed with 30 ml of 12% trichloroacetic acid, 0.2 mH3PO4, and then counted. Steady-state levels of phosphorylation of the ATPase by [γ-32P]ATP were carried out in a similar manner as above. Experiments were carried out at 25 °C in 20 mmHepes/Tris (pH 7.2) containing 100 mm KCl, 5 mmMgSO4, 100 μm CaCl2, and 0.075 mg/ml ATPase. Two stocks of labeled ATP were made up to cover the range of ATP concentrations up to 100 μm, with specific activities of 10 and 100 Ci/mol. The reaction was initiated by addition of [γ-32P]ATP and quenched as described above after 10 s. The samples were then filtered, washed, and counted. Dual wavelength spectrophotometry was performed on a Shimadzu UV-3000 dual wavelength-recording spectrophotometer. Experiments were carried out at 25 °C in 20% (w/v) sucrose, 50 mm Mops/KOH (pH 7) containing 1 mm CaCl2 and 0.8 mg/ml ATPase. Titration of the Ca2+-ATPase with trinitrophenyl adenosine diphosphate (TNP-ADP) was then monitored by recording the absorbance difference at 422 nm and 390 nm, as described by Coll and Murphy (20Coll R.J. Murphy A.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1986; 138: 652-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Fig. 1A shows the effect of mastoparan on purified, fully uncoupled, Ca2+-ATPase activity. The inhibitory constant is determined to be 1 ± 0.13 μm mastoparan. In sealed SR vesicles, ATPase activity is low due to high Ca2+ concentrations in the vesicle lumen, and the inhibition can be relieved by addition of the Ca2+ionophore A23187. Effects of mastoparan on ATPase activity of SR vesicles in the presence of A23187 are very similar to those determined for the purified ATPase (data not shown). However, in the absence of A23187, low concentrations of mastoparan (<1 μm) actually increase the activity of the ATPase. Thus mastoparan increases the permeability of the SR membrane to Ca2+, a phenomenon previously reported by Longland et al. (13Longland C.L. Mezna M. Langel Ü. Hällbrink M. Soomets U. Wheatley M. Michelangeli F. Howl J. Cell Calcium. 1998; 24: 27-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). At higher concentrations of mastoparan (≥1 μm), ATPase activity in sealed SR vesicles decreases due to inhibition of the pump. Fig. 1B shows the effect of mastoparan on the Ca2+ dependence of ATPase activity. A bell-shaped curve was obtained both in the presence and absence of mastoparan. TheK m value for the high-affinity (activatory) Ca2+ sites was increased from 0.16 μm in the absence of peptide to 0.27 μm in the presence of mastoparan. In contrast, the K m value for the lower affinity (inhibitory) sites (0.2 mm) was not significantly effected by the inhibitor. In addition, maximum ATPase activities were observed at similar free Ca2+ concentrations in both the presence and absence of mastoparan (i.e. 6.5 μm). The effect of mastoparan on the dependence of ATPase activity on the concentration of ATP is shown in Fig. 1C. The data are fitted to a modified form of the Michaelis-Menten equation, assuming that ATP interacts at 2 sites: a high-affinity (catalytic) site and a low affinity (regulatory) site (21Kosk-Kosicka D. Kirzmack M. Inesi G. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 2559-2567Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Addition of mastoparan had little effect on ATPase activity at low ATP concentrations but considerably inhibited the pump at higher ATP concentrations. In the absence of peptide, the data could be fitted assuming K m and V max values for the catalytic site of 0.85 μm and 1.68 IU/mg, respectively, and K m and V maxvalues for the regulatory site of 0.15 mm and 4.34 IU/mg, respectively. In the presence of mastoparan, the data could be fitted assuming the same values for the catalytic site and the sameK m value for the regulatory site. TheV max value for the regulatory site, however, decreased to 1.24 IU/mg. Fig. 1D shows the effect of mastoparan on the Mg2+ dependence of ATPase activity. In the absence of mastoparan, ATPase activity decreases with increasing concentrations of Mg2+. At low concentrations of Mg2+, the presence of mastoparan results in strong inhibition of the ATPase. As the Mg2+ concentration is increased from 2–10 mm, stimulation of ATPase activity is then observed followed by inhibition. It has been shown that the E2-E1 equilibrium for the ATPase can be monitored by changes in the fluorescence intensity of the ATPase labeled with NBD (22Wakabayashi S. Imagawa T. Shigekawa M. J. Biochem. 1990; 107: 563-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The fluorescence intensity of the labeled ATPase is higher in the E1 conformation than in the E2 conformation (22Wakabayashi S. Imagawa T. Shigekawa M. J. Biochem. 1990; 107: 563-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Addition of mastoparan to NBD-labeled SR at pH 7.2 (Fig. 2) results in an increase in fluorescence intensity with an apparent K d value of 1.8 μm. The maximal fluorescence increase observed is 17–18%. Therefore mastoparan shifts the E2-E1 equilibrium toward E1. It has been suggested that the E2-E1 equilibrium is pH-dependent with low pH favoring the E2 form (23Froud R.J. Lee A.G. Biochem. J. 1986; 237: 197-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Consequently pH can also be used to trigger the E2-E1 transition. The addition of mastoparan to NBD-labeled SR at pH 6.0 (Fig. 2) also causes an increase in fluorescence intensity, however, with a higher apparentK d (14.1 μm) and a maximal fluorescence increase of ≈31%. The E2-E1 equilibrium can also be studied by monitoring changes in the fluorescence intensity of FITC-labeled ATPase. In contrast to NBD-labeled ATPase, addition of Ca2+ to FITC-labeled ATPase results in a decrease in fluorescence, which has been attributed to the E1 conformational state (23Froud R.J. Lee A.G. Biochem. J. 1986; 237: 197-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). At pH 7.0, where the E1/E2 ratio has been determined to be 0.5 (23Froud R.J. Lee A.G. Biochem. J. 1986; 237: 197-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), calcium induces a decrease in fluorescence of 6%, whereas in the presence of 20 μm mastoparan, this decrease is reduced to 3%. This is consistent with mastoparan having shifted the E2-E1 equilibrium toward the E1 conformation. Furthermore, addition of 20 μm mastoparan to FITC-labeled ATPase in the absence of calcium also caused a 3% decrease in fluorescence. TableI shows the level of45Ca2+ bound to the ATPase at a free Ca2+ concentration of 50 μm, a concentration at which both high-affinity Ca2+ binding sites should be fully saturated. This level is unchanged in the presence of 30 μm mastoparan (added either before or after the labeled Ca2+), demonstrating that mastoparan does not effect the stoichiometry of Ca2+ binding. Levels of Ca2+binding to the native ATPase are higher than expected as a result of nonspecific binding of Ca2+ to the ATPase and associated lipids (19Michelangeli F. Orlowski S. Champeil P. Grimes E.A. East J.M. Lee A.G. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 8307-8312Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar).Table IEffect of mastoparan on 45Ca 2+ binding to purified ATPase (1 μm) at a free Ca 2+ concentration of 50 μmExperimentCa2+ boundnmol/mg ATPaseATPase +45Ca2+27.3 ± 0.1ATPase + 45Ca2+ + mastoparan25.7 ± 1.09ATPase + mastoparan + 45Ca2+27.0 ± 3.5Each value is the mean ± S.D. of three determinations. Open table in a new tab Each value is the mean ± S.D. of three determinations. Fig. 3 shows Ca2+ binding to the ATPase as a function of Ca2+ concentration. It clearly shows that mastoparan reduces the affinity of Ca2+ binding to the ATPase, increasing the K d from 0.6 to 3.7 μm. In the absence of mastoparan, binding of Ca2+ to the ATPase is cooperative, as expected, with a Hill coefficient of 1.60. In the presence of mastoparan, this cooperativity is no longer observed, with the Hill coefficient being reduced to 0.9. Calcium binding and dissociation can also be studied through changes in the tryptophan fluorescence of the ATPase. On addition of Ca2+ to the ATPase, there is an increase in tryptophan fluorescence that has been attributed to the E1Ca-E1′Ca transition, with the E2, E1, and E1Ca forms having relatively low tryptophan intensities and the E1′Ca and E1′Ca2 forms having higher fluorescence intensities (24Fernandez-Belda F. Kurzmack M. Inesi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 9687-9698Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 4 shows that the addition of 20 μm mastoparan to the ATPase causes a shift in the Ca2+ concentration dependence of this transition to higher Ca2+ concentrations. The apparent K dvalue is increased from 1.4 to 25 μm, suggesting once again that mastoparan may decrease the affinity of the ATPase for Ca2+. The presence of the peptide also halves the maximum change in the fluorescence intensity observed. It has been shown in stopped-flow experiments with the Ca2+-ATPase that both Ca2+ binding and dissociation are biphasic in nature (25Henderson M.J. Starling A.P. Wictome M. East M.J. Lee A.G. Biochem. J. 1994; 297: 625-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Fig. 5 shows the binding (A) and dissociation (B) of calcium to and from the ATPase in the absence and presence of 30 μm mastoparan. The kinetic parameters obtained from these experiments are given in TableII. In the absence of peptide, the data for both Ca2+ binding and dissociation can be fitted to the following biexponential equation (fitting these data to a monoexponential equation resulted in much larger χ2values, see Table II) ΔF=A1(1−exp−k1t)+A2(1−exp−k2t)Equation 1 where ΔF equals fluorescence change,A 1, A 2,k 1, and k 2 are the amplitudes and rate constants for the fast and slow phases of Ca2+ binding/dissociation, respectively, and tis time (s).Table IIKinetic data describing the binding and dissociation of Ca 2+ to and from the ATPase in the presence and absence of 30 μmmastoparanExperimentk obs(s−1)Amplitudeχ2FastSlowFastSlowCa2+binding49.87 ± 2.756.62 ± 0.193.52 ± 0.114.13 ± 0.110.3 (1.2)aThis value corresponds to the χ2 obtained if the alternative equation was fitted to the data.Ca2+ binding + mastoparan19.00 ± 0.343.98 ± 0.100.3 (0.3)aThis value corresponds to the χ2 obtained if the alternative equation was fitted to the data.Ca2+ dissociation19.11 ± 1.723.36 ± 0.11−2.03 ± 0.16−6.00 ± 0.130.3 (0.6)aThis value corresponds to the χ2 obtained if the alternative equation was fitted to the data.Ca2+ dissociation + mastoparan37.51 ± 0.91−4.06 ± 0.010.3 (0.3)aThis value corresponds to the χ2 obtained if the alternative equation was fitted to the data.The data are fitted to either a monoexponential or biexponential equation, as described in the text.a This value corresponds to the χ2 obtained if the alternative equation was fitted to the data. Open table in a new tab The data are fitted to either a monoexponential or biexponential equation, as described in the text. In the presence of mastoparan, the data for both Ca2+binding and dissociation can be fitted equally well to the following monoexponential equation. ΔF=A(1−exp−kt)Equation 2 Steady-state levels of phosphorylation can be studied under conditions of low Ca2+where the ATPase will be in a continuous state of turnover. At 25 °C, mastoparan increases the steady-state levels of phosphoenzyme formation over the range of ATP concentrations used (Fig. 6). In the absence of mastoparan, apparent K d and EPmax values of 46 μm and 9.1 nmol EP/mg ATPase, respectively, are obtained, whereas in the presence of mastoparan, these values are reduced to 9 μm and 9.1 nmol EP/mg. These results suggest that mastoparan has either increased the affinity of the ATPase for ATP and/or that the steady-state equilibrium between E1′Ca2 and E1′Ca2·P has been shifted toward E1′Ca2·P. TNP-ADP is known to be a competitve inhibitor of the SR Ca2+-ATPase (26Watanabe T. Inesi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 11510-11516Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Dupont Y. Chapron Y. Pougeois R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1982; 106: 1272-1279Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). It binds very tightly to the active site of the enzyme. Consequently, if the nucleotide binding site of the ATPase is covalently blocked with FITC, TNP-ADP is unable to bind. As described under “Materials and Methods,” dual wavelength spectrophotometry can be used to monitor the absorbance difference at 422 and 390 nm on titration of Ca2+-ATPase with TNP-ADP. This method can be used to determine whether or not mastoparan alters the affinity of the ATPase for TNP-ADP and hence ATP. Under conditions where the ATPase is in the E1 conformation, we determined that the apparent K d for TNP-ADP was 3.76 ± 0.61 μm (data not shown), consistent with TNP-ADP binding to the high affinity nucleotide binding site (28Dupont Y. Pougeois R. Ronjat M. Verjovsky-Almeida S. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 7241-7249Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the presence of 70 μm mastoparan, this value was relatively unchanged, 3.45 ± 0.48 μm. As shown in Fig. 7, mastoparan causes a ≈40% reduction in the levels of phosphoenzyme formed from 1 mm [32P]Pi at 25 °C. The presence of mastoparan therefore shifts the equilibrium between E2 and E2·Pi toward E2. Since mastoparan was first discovered several other analogues have been isolated from different species of wasp. In addition several synthetic analogues have been made. The effect of a selection of these analogues on the ATPase was undertaken, and the results were compared with those obtained for mastoparan. TableIII summarizes the effect of these peptides on the Ca2+-ATPase. The fractional α-helical contents and hydrophobic moments of the peptides derived from other studies are also shown in this table (15Higashijima T. Burnier J. Ross E.M. J. Biol.

MP17 is a relatively inactive synthetic mastoparan analogue, in which two amino acid substitutions reduce α-helix formation as well as decrease the hydrophobic moment of the peptide (15Higashijima T. Burnier J. Ross E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14176-14186Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It can be seen that this peptide is a far weaker inhibitor of the ATPase. TheK i value for MP17 is extrapolated, because at 30 μm MP17 only 10% inhibition was observed. This peptide also has no effect on the fluorescence intensity of NBD-labeled ATPase. MPX and MP7 retain the ability to form α-helices in lipids and have similar hydrophobic moments to mastoparan. They also inhibit the ATPase, with K i values of 4.4 and 2.2 μm, respectively. Similar to mastoparan, these two analogues increase the fluorescence intensity of NBD-labeled ATPase, implying that they too shift the E2-E1 equilibrium toward E1. A number of P2-type ATPases, including the Ca2+-ATPase, H+/K+-ATPase, and Na+/K+-ATPase are inhibited by peptide toxins such as mastoparan and melittin (4Baker K.J. East J.M Lee A.G. Biochem.

Base flipping ofC 5-cytosine DNA methyltransferases was directly observed in the protein-DNA cocrystal structures of M.HhaI and M.HaeIII. Indirect structural evidence for base flipping of N 6-adenine andN 4-cytosine DNA methyltransferases was obtained by modeling DNA into the three-dimensional structures of M.TaqI and M.PvuII in complex with the cofactor. In addition, biochemical evidence of base flipping was reported for different N 6-adenine DNA methyltransferases. As no protein-DNA cocrystal structure for the related N 6-adenine andN 4-cytosine DNA methyltransferases is available, we used light-induced photochemical cross-linking to identify the binding site of the extrahelical target bases. TheN 6-adenine DNA methyltransferases M.TaqI and M.CviBIII, which both methylate adenine within the double-stranded 5′-TCGA-3′ DNA sequence, were photo-cross-linked to duplex oligodeoxyribonucleotides containing 5-iodouracil at the target position in 50–60% and almost quantitative yield, respectively. Proteolytic fragmentation of the M.CviBIII-DNA complex followed by Edman degradation and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry indicates photo-cross-linking to tyrosine 122. In addition, the mutant methyltransferases M.TaqI/Y108A and M.TaqI/F196A were photo-cross-linked with 6-fold and 2-fold reduced efficiency, respectively, which suggests that tyrosine 108 is the primary site of modification in M.TaqI. Our results indicate a close proximity between the extrahelical target base and tyrosine 122 in M.CviBIII or tyrosine 108 in M.TaqI. As both residues belong to the conserved motif IV ((N/D/S)(P/I)P(Y/F/W)) found in all N 6-adenine andN 4-cytosine DNA as well as inN 6-adenine RNA methyltransferases, a similar spatial relationship between the target bases and the aromatic amino acid residue within motif IV is expected for all these methyltransferases.

Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1995; 24: 293-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). As DNA methylation is a postreplicative process that depends on the presence or regulation of DNA Mtases, a particular DNA sequence may exist in its fully methylated, its unmethylated, or transiently in its hemimethylated form. Thus, DNA methylation can be regarded as an increase of the information content of DNA (2Adams R.L.P. Burdon R.H. Molecular Biology of DNA Methylation. Springer-Verlag, New York1985: 3Google Scholar), which serves a wide variety of biological functions, including protection of the host genome from endogenous restriction endonucleases, DNA mismatch repair after replication, regulation of gene expression and DNA replication, embryonic development, genomic imprinting, and X-chromosome inactivation (3Heitman J. Genet. Eng. 1993; 15: 57-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 4Barras F. Marinus M.G. Trends Genet. 1989; 5: 139-143Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 5Jost J.P. Saluz H.P. DNA Methylation: Molecular Biology and Biological Significance. Birkhäuser Verlag, Basel, Switzerland1993Crossref Google Scholar). Furthermore, it plays a role in carcinogenesis (6Chen R.Z. Pettersson U. Beard C. Jackson-Grusby L. Jaenisch R. Nature. 1998; 395: 89-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (777) Google Scholar). Three-dimensional structures are available for theC 5-cytosine DNA Mtases M.HhaI (7Klimasauskas S. Kumar S. Roberts R.J. Cheng X. Cell. 1994; 76: 357-369Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (906) Google Scholar) and M.HaeIII (8Reinisch K.M. Chen L. Verdine G.L. Lipscomb W.N. Cell. 1995; 82: 143-153Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar) in complex with DNA. Both enzymes consist of two domains forming a positively charged cleft, which accommodates the DNA. However, the most striking feature of these protein-DNA complexes is that the target cytosines are completely rotated out of the DNA double helix and placed in a pocket within the cofactor binding domains, where catalysis takes place. In addition, the structures of the N 6-adenine DNA Mtases M.TaqI (9Labahn J. Granzin J. Schluckebier G. Robinson D.P. Jack W.E. Schildkraut I. Saenger W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10957-10961Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar) and the N 4-cytosine DNA Mtase M.PvuII (10Gong W. O'Gara M. Blumenthal R.M. Cheng X. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 2702-2715Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) in the absence of DNA were reported. TheseN 6-adenine andN 4-cytosine DNA Mtases (N-DNA Mtases) also have a bilobal structure forming a positively charged cleft. Modeling B-DNA in this cleft showed that the distance between the target base and the bound AdoMet is too large for a direct methyl group transfer, and a base flipping mechanism as observed for theC 5-cytosine DNA Mtases was postulated. Biochemical evidence for a base flipping mechanism of theN 6-adenine DNA Mtases M.EcoRI (11Allan B.W. Reich N.O. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 14757-14762Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) and M.TaqI (12Holz B. Klimasauskas S. Serva S. Weinhold E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 1076-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar) was obtained using duplex oligodeoxyribonucleotides (ODNs) containing the fluorescent base analogue 2-aminopurine at the target positions. In addition, tighter binding of the N 6-adenine DNA Mtases M.EcoRV (13Cal S. Connolly B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 490-496Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) and M.EcoRI (14Allan B.W. Beechem J.M. Lindstrom W.M. Reich N.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2368-2373Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) to duplex ODNs carrying base analogues with reduced Watson-Crick hydrogen bonding potential at the target positions was observed and attributed to a reduced energetic cost to flip out the target base. Furthermore, a thymine residue placed at the target position within a duplex ODN showed an enhanced reactivity toward potassium permanganate oxidation in the presence of M.TaqI, which was interpreted by a higher accessibility of the thymine residue in the binary complex due to base flipping (15Serva S. Weinhold E. Roberts R.J. Klimas̆auskas S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 3473-3479Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). A structural comparison of M.TaqI with M.HhaI showed that the cofactor binding domains of both enzymes have a very similar fold (16Schluckebier G. O'Gara M. Saenger W. Cheng X. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 247: 16-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). In addition, the cofactors and the motifs IV ((N/D/S)PP(Y/F/W)-motif of N-DNA Mtases and PCQ-motif ofC 5-cytosine DNA Mtases) as well as the motifs VIII (F/Y/W-motif in N-DNA Mtases and QXRXR-motif in C 5-cytosine DNA Mtases) overlay very well. Thus, it was suggested that the extrahelical target adenine in M.TaqI is located in a similar position as the extrahelical cytosine in M.HhaI and that Tyr-108 (motif IV) and Phe-196 (motif VIII) in M.TaqI are responsible for proper orientation of the extrahelical adenine. To identify the binding site of the extrahelical target base inN 6-adenine DNA Mtases, we used ultraviolet light-induced photochemical cross-linking, which is a powerful technique to define specific contact points in nucleoprotein complexes, where direct structural information is not available (for a review, see Ref. 17Meisenheimer K.M. Koch T.H. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1997; 32: 101-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Non-substituted nucleic acids or nucleic acids containing 4-thiouracil, azido-substituted nucleobases, and halogenated pyrimidines like 5-bromouracil, 5-iodouracil, or 5-iodocytosine are typically used in the photo-cross-linking reaction. In contrast to chemical cross-linking, which interposes spacers of varying length between the nucleic acid and the protein, photo-cross-linking produces zero-length cross-links. This allows the identification of contact points in nucleoprotein complexes at high resolution. Although thymine in non-substituted nucleic acids can be photo-cross-linked directly at 253 nm, the yields are generally low, which is most likely due to photodegradation of the proteins and nucleic acids (18Williams K.R. Konigsberg W.H. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 208: 516-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). This problem can be minimized by incorporating photo-activable analogues into nucleic acids, which can be excited above 300 nm. An additional advantage of using substituted nucleic acids is the fact that the site of modification within the nucleic acid sequence is already defined. The highest photo-cross-linking yields for different nucleoprotein complexes were obtained with nucleic acids containing 5-iodouracil, and yields of up to 95% were reported (19Willis M.C. Hicke B.J. Uhlenbeck O.C. Cech T.R. Koch T.H. Science. 1993; 262: 1255-1257Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 20Stump W.T. Hall K.B. RNA. 1995; 1: 55-63PubMed Google Scholar, 21LeCuyer K.A.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 9807-9823Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), which both methylate adenine within the double-stranded 5′-TCGA-3′ DNA sequence, give high photo-cross-linking yields with duplex ODNs containing 5-iodouracil at the target position (SchemeFS1). Using a combination of Edman degradation and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) of a nucleopeptide obtained by proteolytic fragmentation of the covalent M.CviBIII-DNA complex we demonstrate that Tyr-122 (motif IV) is modified in the photo-cross-linking reaction. In addition, results from photo-cross-linking experiments with the mutant Mtases M.TaqI/Y108A (Tyr in motif IV replaced by Ala) and M.TaqI/F196A (Phe in motif VIII replaced by Ala) are discussed. ODNs were synthesized on an Applied Biosystems 392 DNA/RNA synthesizer or purchased from MWG Biotech (Ebersfeld, Germany). The phosphoramidite for 5-iodo-2′-deoxyuridine was purchased from Glen Research. Due to the base lability of 5-iodo-2′-deoxyuridine (26Ferrer E. Wiersma M. Kazimierczak B. Müller C.W. Eritja R. Bioconj.

Purification, evaluation, and hybridization of ODNs were performed as described before (12Holz B. Klimasauskas S. Serva S. Weinhold E.

The expression system was kindly provided by Dr. Waltraud Ankenbauer, Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Cells were grown at 37 °C to an optical density of 0.6 at 600 nm and induced with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (0.1 mm final concentration) at 30 °C for 4 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation (15 min at 4,000 ×g), resuspended in buffer A (20 mm Tris hydrochloride, pH 7.6, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 20 mg/liter phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 5% glycerol) supplemented with potassium chloride (500 mm) and lysed by sonification. After centrifugation (1 h at 30,000 × g), the supernatant was diluted with buffer A to give a potassium chloride concentration of 170 mm and loaded onto an anion-exchange column (DEAE-Sepharose FF, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). M.CviBIII was eluted with buffer A containing potassium chloride (170 mm). The resulting protein solution was diluted with buffer A to yield a potassium chloride concentration of 100 mm and loaded onto a heparin column (heparin-Sepharose CL 6B, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). A potassium chloride gradient (0.1 to 1.0 m) in buffer A was applied and M.CviBIII eluted at a potassium chloride concentration of 200–250 mm. Fractions containing M.CviBIII were combined and concentrated by ultrafiltration (Centriprep 30, Amicon). The concentrated protein solution was loaded onto a gel filtration column (Superdex 200, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and eluted with a Tris hydrochloride buffer (20 mm, pH 7.4) containing potassium chloride (600 mm), EDTA (0.2 mm), and DTT (2 mm). Fractions containing M.CviBIII were pooled, 2-fold diluted with glycerol, and stored at −20 °C. M.CviBIII was at least 90% pure, as judged by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate and staining with Coomassie Blue. Protein concentrations were estimated by the method of Bradford (28Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211425) Google Scholar) (Coomassie Protein Assay Reagent, Pierce) using bovine serum albumin as standard. Typically, photo-cross-linking reactions were performed with a mixture (0.1 ml for analytical and 1 ml for preparative scale) of duplex ODNs (1.2–1.5 μm) and DNA Mtases (2.0–3.0 μm) in Tris acetate buffer (20 mm, pH 7.9) containing potassium acetate (50 mm), magnesium acetate (10 mm) and DTT (1 mm). Photo-cross-linking was induced with a HeCd laser (Liconox, Santa Clara, CA) operating at 325 nm with an intensity of 25 miliwatts/mm2. Samples were irradiated in QS quartz cuvettes (Helma, Mülheim, Germany) at 4 °C for 2 h or indicated times. Photo-cross-linking reactions were either analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis or anion-exchange chromatography. The long ODNs (36 nucleotides) were32P-labeled by treatment with T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs) and [γ-32P]ATP (110 TBq/mmol, 0.4 MBq/μl, Hartmann Analytik, Braunschweig, Germany) in Tris hydrochloride buffer (70 mm, pH 7.6) containing magnesium chloride (10 mm) and DTT (5 mm) prior to the hybridization and photo-cross-linking reactions. Photo-cross-linked and uncross-linked duplex ODNs were separated on 16% SDS-polyacrylamide gels (29Schägger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10399) Google Scholar), and radioactive bands were quantified using a phosphorimager (Molecular Imager System GS 525, Bio-Rad). Reaction mixtures with the short duplex ODN (14 base pairs) were loaded onto an anion-exchange column (Poros HQ10, 4.6 × 100 mm, Perseptive Biosystems), and compounds were eluted with a Tris hydrochloride buffer (10 mm, pH 7.4) containing potassium chloride (0 mmfor 5 min followed by a linear gradient to 1 m within 15 min and 1 m for 10 min) at a flow rate of 2 ml/min. Absorption was detected at 260 nm. Proteolytic fragmentation was investigated using a crude reaction mixture obtained with M.CviBIII and32P-labeled TCGI/TCGA(S). The buffer of the reaction mixture was changed to Tris hydrochloride (10 mm, pH 8.0) and calcium chloride (20 mm) by repeated ultrafiltration (Centricon 10, Amicon), chymotrypsin (50% of total protein weight) was added, and the mixture incubated at 37 °C. Samples were taken after different incubation times and analyzed on a 16% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. For the isolation of the nucleopeptide, a preparative amount of the crude reaction mixture containing approximately 700 pmol of the covalent M.CviBIII-TCGI/TCGA(S) complex was enzymatically fragmented for 16 h, as described above. The nucleopeptide was purified on an anion-exchange column (Poros HQ10, 4.6 × 100 mm, Perseptive Biosystems) using a linear gradient of potassium chloride (0–1.0 m) in Tris hydrochloride buffer (10 mm, pH 7.4). Fractions containing the nucleopeptide (detection at 260 nm) were pooled and desalted by repeated ultrafiltration (Microsep 3K, Pall-Gelman Sciences). Peptide sequencing of the isolated nucleopeptide was performed with an Applied Biosystems 473A protein sequencer using standard conditions. The electrospray ionization mass spectrum of the isolated nucleopeptide was acquired using a double focusing sector field mass spectrometer MAT 90 (Finnigan MAT) equipped with an ESI II electrospray ion source. Initial photo-cross-linking experiments were performed with a hemimethylated duplex ODN (36 base pairs) in which the target adenine within the recognition sequence of M.TaqI is replaced by 5-iodouracil (TCGI/TCGAMe(L); Table I).32P-Labeled TCGI/TCGAMe(L) was irradiated with a HeCd laser at 325 nm in the presence of an excess of M.TaqI. Aliquots were analyzed by denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) after different irradiation times, and a time-dependent formation of a band with lower electrophoretic mobility compared with the free duplex ODN was observed (Fig. 1A). As the mass of the duplex ODN in the DNA-protein cross-link is increased, such a lower mobility is expected for the complex. The photo-cross-linking yields after different irradiation times were determined using a phosphorimager, and the obtained data were fitted to a single exponential function (Fig. 1B). The photo-cross-linking reaction proceeded with a half-life of 20 ± 6 min and a maximum yield of 57 ± 3%. The unmethylated duplex ODN TCGI/TCGA(L) gave a photo-cross-linking yield similar to that for the hemimethylated duplex ODN TCGI/TCGAMe(L). In order to verify that the newly formed band in Fig. 1A is a specific covalent DNA-M.TaqI complex, the following control experiments (data not shown) were performed. Irradiation of TCGI/TCGAMe(L) in the absence of M.TaqI did not produce a band with lower mobility, which eliminates the possibility that the band with lower mobility represents a DNA-DNA cross-link. Additionally, incubation of TCGI/TCGAMe(L) and M.TaqI without irradiation did not result in a band with lower mobility after denaturing PAGE, which demonstrates the covalent nature of the product formed. Furthermore, irradiation of the duplex ODN ICGA/TCGAMe(L), in which the thymine within the recognition sequence is replaced by 5-iodouracil, in the presence of M.TaqI did not lead to a significant formation of a photo-cross-linked product. This result indicates that the photo-cross-linking reaction is DNA sequence-specific. Additionally, irradiation of the control duplex ODNs TCGA/TCGAMe(L) and TCGA/TCGA(L), which do not contain 5-iodouracil, in the presence of M.TaqI yielded no photo-cross-linked product. In addition, electrophoretic mobility shift experiments under native conditions were performed and revealed that binding of M.TaqI to canonical duplex ODNs is in the low nanomolar range and not altered significantly upon 5-iodouracil substitution. For the isolation of a covalent DNA-M.TaqI complex, the photo-cross-linking reaction was performed with TCGI/TCGA(S), a 14-base pair duplex ODN containing 5-iodouracil at the target position, and the reaction mixture was separated by anion-exchange chromatography (Fig. 2). M.TaqI did not bind to the anion-exchange column under the conditions used and eluted in the void volume, whereas TCGI/TCGA(S) eluted after 18.6 min. In addition, a new compound eluting after 12.0 min was observed. Such a lower retention time compared with the free ODN is expected for a DNA-M.TaqI complex, because binding of M.TaqI should lead to some steric shielding of the negatively charged phosphodiester backbone. From the peak areas of the compounds eluting after 12.0 and 18.6 min, a photo-cross-linking yield of 53% with regard to the duplex ODN TCGI/TCGA(S) was calculated. The material eluting after 12.0 min was isolated, desalted, 32P-labeled by treatment with T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP, and analyzed by denaturing PAGE (Fig. 3). Again, a strongly reduced electrophoretic mobility (Fig. 3, lane 2) compared with the free ODN TCGI/TCGA(S) (Fig. 3,lane 1) was observed. In addition, a mixture of M.TaqI and TCGI/TCGA(S) did not show a band with reduced mobility under denaturing conditions (Fig. 3, lane 3), demonstrating that the material eluting after 12.0 min during anion-exchange chromatography is a covalent DNA-M.TaqI complex.Figure 3Denaturing PAGE of the isolated photo-cross-linked DNA-M.TaqI complex. Lane 1, 32P-labeled duplex ODN TCGI/TCGA(S) alone; lane 2, isolated (material eluting after 12.0 min in Fig. 2) and 32P-labeled photo-cross-link between M.TaqI and the duplex ODN TCGI/TCGA(S); lane 3, non-covalent complex between M.TaqI and 32P-labeled duplex ODN TCGI/TCGA(S).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In order to identify the photo-cross-linked amino acid in M.TaqI, the covalent DNA-M.TaqI complex was subjected to proteolytic degradation after purification by anion-exchange chromatography. However, enzymatic fragmentation of the covalent DNA-M.TaqI complex with different specific proteases (trypsin, chymotrypsin, elastase, and V8 endopeptidase) even under partially denaturing conditions (1 m guanidinium hydrochloride, 1% SDS, or 30% methanol) did not produce a small nucleopeptide complex. Thus, the resistance of the covalent DNA-M.TaqI complex toward proteases, presumably due to the thermophilic nature of M.TaqI, precluded further characterization of the photo-cross-linked amino acid in M.TaqI. In order to investigate, whether Tyr at position 108 or Phe at position 196 of M.TaqI is involved in the photo-cross-linking reaction, the two mutant Mtases M.TaqI/Y108A and M.TaqI/F196A were tested. In these mutant Mtases, the aromatic amino acid residues Tyr at position 108 or Phe at position 196 of M.TaqI are replaced by the non-aromatic amino acid residue Ala. The photo-cross-linking yields of the duplex ODN TCGI/TCGA(L) with M.TaqI/Y108A and M.TaqI/F196A compared with the wild-type enzyme were 6- and 2-fold reduced, respectively (data not shown). For further photo-cross-linking reactions, we used the mesophilic N 6-adenine DNA Mtase M.CviBIII, which is an isoschizomer of M.TaqI. Analyses of the photo-cross-linking reaction between M.CviBIII and the short duplex ODN TCGI/TCGA(S) by anion-exchange chromatography revealed that almost all the duplex ODN had reacted, and a new compound with a retention time of 7.9 min was formed (Fig. 4). M.CviBIII eluted in the void volume as observed for M.TaqI. As the photo-cross-linking reaction with M.CviBIII was almost quantitative with respect to the duplex ODN, a crude reaction mixture of 32P-labeled TCGI/TCGA(S) and M.CviBIII was subjected to proteolytic fragmentation with chymotrypsin, and the time course of the protease reaction was analyzed by denaturing PAGE (Fig. 5). After 16 h, almost all reaction intermediates had converted to a final product. The smaller electrophoretic mobility of this proteolytic end product compared with the free duplex ODN indicates that a peptide fragment remained bound to the DNA.Figure 5Proteolytic fragmentation of the photo-cross-linked DNA-M.CviBIII complex with chymotrypsin.

C4BP can bind anticoagulant protein S, resulting in a decreased cofactor function of protein S for activated protein C. C4BP is a multimeric protein containing several identical α-chains and a single β-chain (C4BPβ), each chain being composed of short consensus repeats (SCRs). Previous studies have localized the protein S binding site to the NH2-terminal SCR (SCR-1) of C4BPβ. To further localize the protein S binding site, we constructed chimeras containing C4BPβ SCR-1, SCR-2, SCR-3, SCR-1+2, SCR-1+3, and SCR-2+3 fused to tissue-type plasminogen activator. Binding assays of protein S with these chimeras indicated that SCR-2 contributes to the interaction of protein S with SCR-1, since the affinity of protein S for SCR-1+2 was up to 5-fold higher compared with SCR-1 and SCR-1+3. Using an assay that measures protein S cofactor activity, we showed that cofactor activity was decreased due to binding to constructs that contain SCR-1. SCR-1+2 inhibited more potently than SCR-1 and SCR-1+3. SCR-3 had no additional effect on SCR-1, and therefore the effect of SCR-2 was specific.

Complex formation between protein S and C4BP has no effect on the inhibition of complement activation. C4BP is a multimeric glycoprotein (M r 530,000–570,000), composed of six or seven identical α-chains, and approximately 80–85% of C4BP contains an additional single β-chain that binds protein S (8Dahlbäck B.

Alim R.I. Härdig Y. Zöller B. Dahlbäck B. Blood. 1994; 84: 815-822Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). During an acute phase response, C4BP levels can increase up to 4-fold. Due to a mechanism of differential regulation of α- and β-chain expression, an increase of α-chains predominates during such an acute phase response, and hence free protein S is held at stable levels (21Garcı́a de Frutos P. Alim R.I. Härdig Y. Zöller B. Dahlbäck B. Blood. 1994; 84: 815-822Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The α-chains (M r 70,000) are composed of eight homologous domains called short consensus repeats (SCRs) (17Hillarp A. Dahlbäck B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

However, noncomplement regulatory proteins have also been found containing SCR units such as β2 glycoprotein I and the β-subunit of coagulation factor XIII, in which the function of the SCR units are unknown (for reviews, see Refs. 23Reid K.B.M.

Studies using chimeric SCR-tPA constructs show that SCR-2 of C4BP β-chain is involved in the interaction of protein S with SCR-1. C4BP was immunopurified from human plasma as described by Hessing et al. (32Hessing M. Kanters D. Hackeng T.M. Bouma B.N. Thromb.

Purified constructs were applied to 10% SDS-PAGE under reducing and nonreducing conditions and stained by Coomassie Brilliant Blue or transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA) for standard Western blotting procedures using sheep anti-tPA antibodies (1 μg/ml, Enzyme Research Laboratories Inc.) followed by a polyclonal peroxidase-conjugated antibody against sheep antibodies (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark). The binding of protein S to immobilized chimeric SCR-tPA constructs was performed as follows. Microtiter plates (96-well vinyl assay plates; catalog no. 2595, Costar, Cambridge, MA) were coated overnight at 4 °C with a polyclonal antibody against tissue plasminogen activator (5 μg/ml; ImulyseTM-tPA, Biopool AB) in coat buffer (15 mm Na2CO3.10 H2O, 35 mm NaHCO3, pH 9.6), 50 μl/well. Plates were washed three times with Tris-buffered saline (TBS; 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl) containing 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20. Plates were blocked for 2 h at 37 °C with TBS containing 3% (w/v) bovine serum albumin (blocking buffer), 100 μl/well. CHO-II-SFM supernatant derived from baby hamster kidney cells transfected with the constructs described above was then added to the wells and incubated for 2 h at 37 °C in blocking buffer containing 0.1% Tween 20, 50 μl/well. After washing three times with TBS containing 0.1% Tween 20, increasing concentrations of protein S were added to the wells and incubated for 2 h at 37 °C in blocking buffer containing 0.1% Tween 20 and 5 mm CaCl2, 50 μl/well. Plates were washed three times with TBS containing 0.1% Tween 20, and bound protein S was detected using a polyclonal peroxidase-conjugated antibody against protein S (1.3 g/liter IgG; Dako), 1:2000 diluted in blocking buffer containing 0.1% Tween 20 and 5 mm CaCl2, 50 μl/well. After washing three times with TBS containing 0.1% Tween 20, staining solution consisting of 0.4 mg/mlo-phenylenediamine and 0.002% H2O2in 100 mm phosphate, 50 mm citric acid buffer (pH 5.0) was added to the wells (100 μl/well). The reaction was stopped by adding 50 μl/well 1 mH2SO4, and absorbance was measured at 490 nm in a V max microtiter plate reader (Molecular Devices, Menlo Park, CA). Values were corrected for background absorbance. Microtiter plates were coated overnight at 4 °C with a polyclonal antibody against protein S (3 g/liter IgG; Dako), 1:1000 diluted in coat buffer, 50 μl/well. Plates were washed three times with TBS containing 0.1% Tween 20. Plates were blocked for 2 h at 37 °C with blocking buffer, 100 μl/well. Purified human protein S (1 μg/ml) was added to the wells and incubated in blocking buffer containing 0.1% Tween 20 and 5 mm CaCl2 for 2 h at 37 °C, 50 μl/well. Plates were washed three times with TBS containing 0.1% Tween 20, and increasing concentrations of purified chimeric SCR-tPA constructs were added and incubated for 2 h at 37 °C in blocking buffer containing 0.1% Tween 20 and 5 mm CaCl2, 50 μl/well. After washing the plates three times with TBS containing 0.1% Tween 20, sheep anti-tPA antibodies (1 μg/ml; Enzyme Research Laboratories Inc.) were added in blocking buffer containing 0.1% Tween 20 and 5 mmCaCl2, 50 μl/well. After 1 h of incubation at 37 °C, plates were washed three times with TBS containing 0.1% Tween 20. Bound sheep antibodies against tPA were detected by adding a polyclonal peroxidase-conjugated rabbit antibody against sheep antibodies (Dako), 1:1000 diluted in blocking buffer containing 0.1% Tween 20 and 5 mm CaCl2, 50 μl/well. After washing three times with TBS containing 0.1% Tween 20, the wells were developed and measured as described above. Values were corrected for background absorbance. A fluid phase binding assay was used to investigate the stoichiometry of the interaction between protein S and the SCR-tPA constructs that bound to protein S. For this assay, 5 mg of purified rabbit antibodies directed against human protein S (Dako) was coupled to 2.5 ml of CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Fluid phase binding was performed by allowing increasing concentrations of SCR-tPA constructs to bind to 10 nm human protein S in a volume of 100 μl of TBS containing 5% bovine serum albumin and 10 mm CaCl2. Binding was performed overnight at 4 °C with constant rotation. Then 100 μl of rabbit anti-human protein S-Sepharose beads in TBS was added (final CaCl2concentration 5 mm). After 90 min of incubation with constant rotation at room temperature, total protein S was removed from the incubation mixture by spinning down the Sepharose beads in an Eppendorf centrifuge for 3 min at 14,000 rpm. The supernatant was analyzed with a polyclonal tPA ELISA (ImulyseTM-tPA, Biopool AB) for nonbound (free) SCR-tPA constructs. As a control, the supernatant was also analyzed with a polyclonal protein S ELISA to confirm that all of the protein S was precipitated by the Sepharose beads. In this polyclonal ELISA, rabbit anti-protein S antibodies were used as catching antibodies, and peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-protein S antibodies were used as detecting antibodies (antibodies from Dako). Microtiter plates were coated overnight at 4 °C with a monoclonal antibody against C4BPα (8C11) in coat buffer, 2 μg/ml, 50 μl/well. Plates were washed three times with TBS containing 0.1% Tween 20. Plates were blocked for 2 h at 37 °C with blocking buffer, 100 μl/well. Purified human C4BP (2 μg/ml) was incubated in blocking buffer for 1 h at 37 °C. Purified human protein S (0.5 nm) was preincubated with chimeric SCR-tPA constructs (0–400 nm) for 1 h at 37 °C in blocking buffer containing 5 mmCaCl2. After washing the plates three times with TBS containing 0.1% Tween 20, aliquots of 50 μl from the preincubation mixtures were applied to the plates and incubated for 2 h at 37 °C. After washing three times with TBS containing 0.1% Tween 20, bound protein S was detected using a polyclonal peroxidase-conjugated antibody against protein S (1.3 g/liter IgG; Dako), 1:2000 diluted in blocking buffer containing 0.1% Tween 20 and 5 mmCaCl2, 50 μl/well. After washing three times with TBS containing 0.1% Tween 20, the wells were developed and measured as described above. Values were corrected for background absorbance. Protein S cofactor activity was determined with an activated partial thromboplastin time-based assay using a KC-10A microcoagulometer (Amelung, Lemgo, Germany). For this assay, plasma deficient in protein S and C4BP was prepared by immunoadsorption as described previously (37Hackeng T.M. van 't Veer C. Meijers J.C.M. Bouma B.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21051-21058Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Purified human protein S (160 nm) was preincubated for 30 min at 37 °C with serial dilutions of chimeric SCR-tPA constructs in TBS containing 0.3% (w/v) bovine serum albumin plus 3 mmCaCl2. Aliquots of 12.5 μl from the preincubation mixtures were added to a mixture of 25 μl of plasma deficient in protein S and C4BP and 12.5 μl of 240 nm activated protein C solution (final APC concentration 30 nm). After adding 25 μl of PTT reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), coagulation was initiated by adding 25 μl of 25 mmCaCl2 (final volume 100 μl). In the range of protein S used in this assay (0–20 nm protein S), there was a linear relationship between clotting time and protein S concentration (data not shown). The protein S cofactor activity was expressed as a percentage of the maximum cofactor activity in the absence of chimeric SCR-tPA constructs. In order to study the role of each individual C4BPβ SCR unit in the interaction of C4BP with protein S, chimeras were constructed of β-chain SCR units fused to the NH2 terminus of a modified tPA. Baby hamster kidney cells were transfected with the expression vector containing the chimeric SCR-tPA constructs. Expression levels in the medium were detected using a tPA ELISA system and were 1–5 μg/ml after 3 days of culture. After purification of the chimeric constructs with an immobilized monoclonal antibody against tPA, the constructs were applied to 10% SDS-PAGE under reducing and nonreducing conditions and stained by Coomassie Brilliant Blue (Fig. 1, A and B) or transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA) for standard Western blotting procedures using a polyclonal antibody against tPA (Fig. 2,A and B). The chimeric SCR-tPA constructs appeared as diffuse bands, which is probably caused by heterogeneous glycosylation of the proteins, because the β-chain of C4BP and the tPA module are both highly glycosylated (17Hillarp A. Dahlbäck B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 1183-1187Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 29Meijers J.C.M. Mulvihill E.R. Davie E.W. Chung D.W. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 4680-4684Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Constructs containing single β-chain SCR units had molecular weights of approximately 73,000 with the exception of SCR-3, which had an estimated molecular weight of 65,000. Constructs containing two β-chain SCR units had molecular weights of approximately 80,000. The chimeric SCR-tPA constructs were also detected by Western blotting using a polyclonal antibody against tPA (Fig. 2, A and B).Figure 2Immunoblot of chimeric SCR-tPA constructs. Purified chimeric SCR-tPA constructs (200 ng) were applied to 10% SDS-PAGE gel under nonreducing (A) and reducing conditions (B).

The results are expressed as a percentage of maximum binding (B max) for each construct. Apparent dissociation constants of the binding of protein S to chimeric SCR-tPA constructs were 10.3 nm for SCR-1, 1.9 nm for SCR-1+2, and 13.7 nm for SCR-1+3, respectively. Protein S did not bind to SCR-2, SCR-3, SCR-2+3, or tPA. The apparent dissociation constant for the binding of protein S to plasma C4BP was 1.7 nm, which is identical to published values (10Dahlbäck B. Biochem. J. 1983; 209: 847-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). This indicates that protein S has an affinity for SCR-1+ 2 that is comparable with the affinity for plasma C4BP, whereas the affinity of protein S for SCR-1 and SCR-1+3 was approximately 5 times lower. A binding assay was performed in which chimeric SCR-tPA constructs were allowed to bind to immobilized protein S. The results of the binding experiments of chimeric SCR-tPA constructs to immobilized protein S are presented in Fig. 4. Binding of each chimeric SCR-tPA construct is expressed as a percentage of B maxto protein S. The apparent dissociation constants for the binding of chimeric SCR-tPA constructs to protein S are 207.4 nm for SCR-1, 24.9 nm for SCR-1+2, and 124.0 nm for SCR-1+3, respectively. SCR-2, SCR-3, SCR-2+3, and tPA did not bind to protein S. The apparent dissociation constant for the binding of plasma-purified C4BP to protein S was 2.9 nm, which is in the range of previously published values between 2 and 5 nm(28Härdig Y. Dahlbäck B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20861-20867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). This implies that in this system, SCR-1+2 has an affinity for protein S approximately 5–10 times lower compared with plasma-purified C4BP. The stoichiometry of the interaction between protein S and the SCR-tPA constructs that bound to protein S was analyzed using a fluid phase binding assay. Increasing concentrations of SCR-tPA constructs were allowed to bind to protein S, after which total protein S was immunoprecipitated using rabbit anti-protein S antibodies coupled to Sepharose beads. After immunoprecipitation, no protein S could be detected in the supernatant using a polyclonal protein S ELISA. Free SCR-tPA in the supernatant was determined using a polyclonal tPA ELISA. Bound SCR-tPA was calculated by subtracting values for free SCR-tPA from the concentrations of SCR-tPA added. Values for bound SCR-tPA were plotted against free SCR-tPA (data not shown), and theB max of each SCR-tPA construct was calculated. The stoichiometry of the interaction of protein S with each protein S-binding SCR-tPA construct is presented in TableII as the ratio ofB max and the protein S concentration used. The values for B max/protein S displayed in Table IIare presented as means of two separate experiments. One protein S molecule was found to bind to 1.0 molecule of SCR-1, 1.0 molecule of SCR-1+2, and 1.1 molecules of SCR-1+3, respectively. These findings show that each SCR-tPA construct that is able to bind to protein S (SCR-1, SCR-1+2, and SCR-1+3) contains one binding site for protein S, confirming the existence of a single binding site for protein S on the β-chain of C4BP.Table IIOverview of apparent dissociation constants and concentrations of 50% inhibitionLigandApparentK D, binding of protein S to immobilized SCRs (Fig. 3)Apparent K D, binding of SCRs to immobilized protein S (Fig. 4)50% inhibition of binding of protein S to immobilized C4BP (Fig. 5)50% inhibition of protein S cofactor activity (Fig. 6)Stoichiometry (B max/protein S)nmnmnmnmSCR-110.3207.42123201.0SCR-1+21.924.922701.0SCR-1+313.7124.01792101.1Only the chimeric SCR-tPA constructs that bound to protein S are shown.

An active reduced enzyme is regenerated by reducing cofactors, which become oxidized. This report examines the mechanism by which PHS from ram seminal vesicle microsomes catalyzes the oxidation of the reducing cofactor <i>N</i>-acetylbenzidine (ABZ). During the conversion of 0.06 mm ABZ to its final end product, 4′-nitro-4-acetylaminobiphenyl, a new metabolite was observed when 1 mm ascorbic acid was present. Similar results were observed whether 0.2 mm arachidonic acid or 0.5 mmH<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> was used as the substrate. This metabolite co-eluted with synthetic<i>N</i>′-hydroxy-<i>N</i>-acetylbenzidine (N′HA), but not with <i>N</i>-hydroxy-<i>N</i>-acetylbenzidine. The new metabolite was identified as N′HA by electrospray ionization/MS/MS. N′HA represented as much as 10% of the total radioactivity recovered by high pressure liquid chromatography. When N′HA was substituted for ABZ, PHS metabolized N′HA to 4′-nitro-4-acetylaminobiphenyl. Inhibitor studies demonstrated that metabolism was due to PHS, not cytochrome P-450. The lack of effect of 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline <i>N</i>-oxide, mannitol, and superoxide dismutase suggests the lack of involvement of one-electron transfer reactions and suggests that hydroxyl radicals and superoxide are not sources of oxygen or oxidants. Oxygen uptake studies did not demonstrate a requirement for molecular oxygen. When [<sup>18</sup>O]H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> was used as the substrate, <sup>18</sup>O enrichment was observed for 4′-nitro-4-acetylaminobiphenyl, but not for N′HA. A 97% enrichment was observed for one atom of <sup>18</sup>O, and a 17 ± 7% enrichment was observed for two <sup>18</sup>O atoms. The rapid exchange of <sup>18</sup>O-N′HA with water was suggested to explain the lack of enrichment of N′HA and the low enrichment of two<sup>18</sup>O atoms into 4′-nitro-4-acetylaminobiphenyl. Results demonstrate a peroxygenase oxidation of ABZ and N′HA by PHS and suggest a stepwise oxidation of ABZ to N′-hydroxy, 4′-nitroso, and 4′-nitro products."
https://openalex.org/W2063098234,"An exciting application of protein engineering is the creation of proteins with novel functions by the retrofitting of native proteins. Such attempts might be facilitated by the idea of a mosaic architecture of proteins out of structural units. Even though numerous theoretical concepts deal with the delineation of structural “modules,” their potential in the design of proteins has not yet been sufficiently exploited. To address this question we used a gain of function approach by designing modular chimeric molecules out of two structurally homologous but functionally diverse members of the superfamily of serine-proteinase inhibitors, α1-proteinase inhibitor and thyroxine-binding globulin. Substitution of two of four α1-proteinase inhibitor modules (Lys222 to Leu288 and Pro362 to Lys394, respectively), identified by α-backbone distance analysis, with their thyroxine-binding globulin homologues resulted in a bifunctional chimera with inhibition of human leukocyte elastase and high affinity thyroxine binding. To our knowledge, this is the first report on a bifunctional chimera engineered from modules of homologous globular proteins. Our results demonstrate how a modular concept can facilitate the design of new functional proteins by swapping structural units chosen from members of a protein superfamily.

In all but the smallest proteins, crystallography has revealed that polypeptide chains form several more or less compact units. When loosely connected to the remaining molecule, such units are usually referred to as domains, which implicates the possibility of an autonomous existence (1Wetlaufer D.B. Ristow S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1973; 42: 135-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). In many other cases, the mosaic nature of proteins is less obvious, and numerous concepts have been developed to facilitate the delineation of “modules” thought to rule the folding, function, and biological evolution of proteins (2Nemethy G. Scheraga H.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 6050-6054Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 3Crippen G. J. Mol.

The increasing frequency with which functionally unrelated proteins are found to contain recurrent structural motifs suggests that the number of natural folds is limited (9Chothia C. Nature. 1992; 357: 543-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (799) Google Scholar, 10Orengo C.A. Jones D.T. Thornton J.M. Nature. 1994; 372: 631-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar) and that complex proteins have evolved by modular assembly (11Henikoff S. Greene E.A. Pietrokovski S. Bork P. Attwood T.K. Hood L. Science. 1997; 278: 609-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Such evolutionarily refined structural units are attractive candidates as building blocks for the design of novel proteins. This concept may be exploited for thein vitro recombination of homologous, i.e.structurally related, proteins. Based on sequence similarities, an ever increasing number of homologous but functionally diverse proteins are recognized as members of the superfamily of serine-proteinaseinhibitors (serpins). 1The abbreviations used are: serpin, serine-proteinase inhibitor; α1PI, α1-proteinase inhibitor; bv, baculovirus (recombinant); HLE, human leukocyte elastase; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; TBG, thyroxine-binding globulin; RSL, reactive site loop; SI, stoichiometry of inhibition; T4, thyroxine; s, strand (i.e. s1C). 1The abbreviations used are: serpin, serine-proteinase inhibitor; α1PI, α1-proteinase inhibitor; bv, baculovirus (recombinant); HLE, human leukocyte elastase; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; TBG, thyroxine-binding globulin; RSL, reactive site loop; SI, stoichiometry of inhibition; T4, thyroxine; s, strand (i.e. s1C). They presumably evolved from a common ancestor at least 500 million years ago (12Hunt L.T. Dayhoff M.O. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1980; 95: 864-871Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). Most of more than 100 known members of the serpin superfamily are true inhibitors of serine proteinases, best exemplified by the archetypical serpin α1-proteinase inhibitor (α1PI). Serpins are fundamentally important in the regulation of major proteolytic cascades, such as blood coagulation, fibrinolysis, inflammatory response, and extracellular matrix turnover (reviewed in Ref. 13Potempa J. Korzus E. Travis J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15957-15960Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, some serpins have lost the inhibitory function and serve as transport proteins for small ligands, such as thyroxine-binding globulin (TBG) (14Refetoff S. Endocr. Rev. 1994; 3: 162-164Google Scholar) and corticosteroid-binding globulin (15Hammond G.L. Endocrine Rev. 1990; 11: 65-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). TBG has an exceptionally high binding constant (K a = 1010m−1) for thyroxine (T4) and a binding energy close to a covalent bond (16Korcek L. Tabachnick M. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 3558-3562Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The crystallographic structures of several serpins have been determined (reviewed in Refs. 17Huber R. Carrell R.W. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 8951-8966Crossref PubMed Scopus (828) Google Scholar and 18Whisstock J. Skinner R. Lesk A.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 63-67Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Their highly compact single-domain structure has a scaffold of three crossed β-sheets (A–C). Inhibitory serpins are characterized by a reactive site loop (RSL) located between β-sheets A and C. Proteinase inhibition involves the incorporation of the cleaved RSL into the A-sheet. This structural rearrangement is accompanied by an increase in stability (stressed-to-relaxed transition (19Bruch M. Weiss V. Engel J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 16626-16630Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)) and the generation of SDS-stable serpin-proteinase complexes (20Travis A.J. Salvesen G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1983; 52: 655-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (1471) Google Scholar). Although the individual serpins have become remarkably diversified by evolution, they share a common molecular pathology (21Stein P.E. Carrell R.W. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 96-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). Inhibitory dysfunction is caused by disturbances of the hinges of the RSL (P14–P12 of the RSL and strand 1C) (22Carrell R.W. Stein P.E. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1996; 377: 1-17Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or by prevention of insertion (23Schulze A.J. Frohnert P.W. Engh R.A. Huber R. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 7560-7565Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Although α1PI has no known ligand, its sheet C and part of sheet B form a twisted β-barrel-like structure, characteristic of ligand-binding proteins. By affinity labeling the homologous regions have been shown to comprise the hormone-binding sites of TBG (24Tabachnick M. Perret V. Biochem. Int. 1987; 15: 409-417PubMed Google Scholar) and corticosteroid-binding globulin (25Kahn M.S. Rosner W. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 1895-1900Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), both of which share 40% sequence identity with α1PI. So far, it has not been tested whether the inhibitory function and the ligand-binding function are mutually exclusive within the serpin scaffold. We now present a novel concept of a modular architecture of the serpin structure and construction of an α1PI-TBG chimera with both inhibitory activity and high affinity T4binding. α1PI M-type cDNA (26Ciliberto G. Dente L. Cortese R. Cell. 1985; 41: 531-540Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) was a kind gift from R. Foreman (Southampton, United Kingdom). A vector containing the full-length cDNA of TBG had been constructed previously (27Janssen O.E. Refetoff S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13998-14004Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Vent DNA polymerase and restriction endonucleases were obtained from New England Biolabs. Spodoptera frugiperdaSf9 cells (ATCC catalog no. CRL 1711) and wild type baculovirus DNA were from Invitrogen. Liposomes for transfection and SF900 II insect cell culture medium were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. Purified TBG and rabbit anti-TBG serum were generously donated by R. Gärtner (Munich, Germany). Rabbit anti-α1PI serum, human leukocyte elastase (HLE, EC 3.4.21.37), and transthyretin were from Calbiochem. T4 stock solutions and TBG concentrations were quantified using commercially available radioimmunoassays (Brahms Diagnostica, Berlin, Germany and CIS Bio Int., Gif-Sur-Yvette, France). Inhibition assays and active site titrations were measured on a Beckman DU 640 spectrophotometer. Human TBG cDNA was subcloned via the KpnI and HindIII sites and human α1PI cDNA via the PstI site into the transfer vector pBlueBac4 (Invitrogen). The splicing sites of the chimeras mapped to highly conserved regions (homology region H1 and H2) and to a putative permissive surface loop (splicing site RS, C-terminal to the RSL). The chimeric constructs were then generated by repeated cycles of two-step polymerase chain reaction overlap extension (28Horton R.M. Hunt H.D. Ho S.N. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene. 1989; 77: 61-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (2614) Google Scholar) with the linearized TBG and α1PI plasmids or the gel-purified intermediate polymerase chain reaction products (P1T2–4, P1T2P3–4) 2The names of the chimeras illustrate the composition from modules (the subscript numbers) of TBG and α1PI (preceding letter T orP), e.g. in P1T2P3–4, modules 1, 3, and 4 are α1PI sequences, whereas the second module is a TBG sequence. The denotation of serpin secondary structure elements and their assignments to TBG are as described in Ref. 17Huber R. Carrell R.W. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 8951-8966Crossref PubMed Scopus (828) Google Scholar. as templates, respectively. The cDNAs were fused sequentially at homology regions H1 and H2 and splicing site RS with the primers listed in Table I.

Sf9 cells (5 × 106 log phase) maintained exclusively in serum-free medium were cotransfected with 1 μg of linearized wild type virus and 4 μg of each of the transfer plasmids by lipofection (29Felgner P.L. Ringold G.M. Nature. 1989; 337: 387-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (836) Google Scholar). β-Galactosidase-positive recombinant clones were selected by plaque assay and screened for wild type virus contamination by polymerase chain reaction (30Webb A.C. Bradley M.K. Phelan S.A. Wu J.Q. Gehrke L. BioTechniques. 1991; 11: 512-518PubMed Google Scholar). For protein expression, log-phase Sf9 cells from a spinner culture were seeded in tissue culture flasks and infected with recombinant virus at a multiplicity of infection of five. The medium was changed 12 h later and supplemented with 10 μm1-(l-trans-epoxysuccinylleucylamino)-4-guanidinobutane and 10 μm pepstatin A (both from Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Forty-eight hours post infection, the culture supernatants were collected by centrifugation at 1500 ×g for 15 min, concentrated, and washed (0.1 mNaCl, 0.1 m Hepes, pH 7.4) by ultrafiltration (Centriplus 30, Millipore Corp.). Protein concentrations were determined by Scatchard analysis of T4 binding and by densitometry of Coomassie Blue-stained gels using purified serum TBG as the standard. Samples were run on 10% continuous tris/glycine gels under denaturing, nonreducing conditions. For PAGE under native conditions, SDS was omitted from all buffers. Blotted nitrocellulose membranes were probed with rabbit anti-TBG or rabbit anti-α1PI antiserum as primary antibody, respectively, followed by enhanced chemiluminescence immunodetection with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as secondary antibody. Samples were incubated in assay buffer (0.4 m NaCl, 0.05% Triton X-100, 0.1 m Hepes, pH 7.4) with HLE in molar concentrations between 1:1 and 20:1 (proteinase:sample) for 20 min at 37 °C. HLE was incubated at 37 °C for 15 min with increasing amounts of recombinant proteins in assay buffer (see above). The residual proteolytic activity was calculated from the increase in absorbance (410 nm) after the addition of 0.5 mm N-methoxysuccinyl-A-A-P-V-p-nitroanilide (Calbiochem) as chromogenic substrate. Rates of substrate hydrolysis were constant over the 3-min period used to determine residual activities. The intercept on the abscissa of the plot of the fraction of enzyme remaining (E/E 0)versus the ratio of the initial inhibitor to initial enzyme concentration (I0/E 0) yielded the apparent stoichiometry of the reaction. Control reactions with supernatants of cells infected with baculovirus expressing TBG excluded endogenous HLE inhibitory activity, degradation of HLE, and substrate loss to endogenous proteinases. Parameters of T4binding to the recombinant proteins were measured by a method previously described in detail (31Murata Y. Refetoff S. Sarne D.H. Dick M. Watson F. J. Endocrinol. Invest. 1985; 8: 225-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Briefly, samples were diluted with 270 mm barbital buffer (pH 8.6) or phosphate-buffered saline (pH 8.0) and incubated with [125I]T4(specific activity, 48.8 MBq/μg, NEN Life Science Products) in the presence of increasing amounts of unlabeled T4. After equilibration, protein bound was separated from free [125I]T4 with anion exchange resin beads (M-400, Mallinckrodt), and the specific 125I binding was determined. The affinity constants (K a) and binding capacities for T4 were calculated by Scatchard analysis (32Scatchard G. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1949; 51: 660-672Crossref Scopus (17746) Google Scholar). The functional stability of recombinant proteins was quantified by thermal denaturation in a water bath at 60 ± 0.1 °C for various periods of time or at various temperatures for 20 min, respectively. The samples were then cooled on ice and centrifuged for 15 min at 13,000 × g to remove precipitated protein. Residual specific T4 binding capacity or HLE inhibitory activity was expressed relative to controls kept at 4 °C. The half-lives (t1/2) of heat denaturation were calculated by least square analysis of semi-logarithmic plots of the remaining specific T4 bindingversus time of incubation. Based on the structure of α1PI and guided by a distance analysis of its carbon backbone using a diagonal plot (8Go M. Nature. 1981; 291: 90-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar, 33Rao S.T. Rossmann M.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1973; 76: 241-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar), four compact structural units of the serpin fold were identified (Figs.1 and2A). Modules 1 and 3 complement each other to form an α-β sandwich, while modules 2 and 4 constitute a discontinuous β-barrel fold. The segregation into these two subdomains becomes even more apparent in cleaved serpins with the RSL inserted into sheet A.Figure 2Modular design of α1PI-TBG chimeras. A, topological schematic (35Levitt M. Chothia C. Nature. 1976; 261: 552-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (1080) Google Scholar) of α1PI with the secondary structure elements represented by circles (α-helices (h)) and triangles (β-strands (s)). The splicing sites for the construction of the chimeras are indicated by H1, H2, and RS. The molecule is organized in two subdomains, an α-β sandwich motif consisting of the first and third module and a β-barrel consisting of modules 2 and 4.

Gray, α1PI modules;white, TBG modules.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To introduce the putative ligand-binding site of TBG into the α1PI scaffold, its complete β-barrel was substituted by the TBG homologue to give chimera P1T2P3T4 (Figs.2B and 9). As controls, chimeras containing only module 2 of TBG in the α1PI scaffold (P1T2P3–4) or module 1 of α1PI in the TBG scaffold (P1T2–4) were constructed. The boundaries of the modules coincided with regions that are highly conserved throughout the serpins (homology regions H1 and H2) or matched to a permissive loop region (RS, C-terminal to the RSL), thereby reducing the probability of local structural disturbance in the chimeric proteins. The corresponding hybrid cDNAs, generated by repeated cycles of splicing by overlap extension polymerase chain reaction, were used to produce recombinant baculovirus by in vivo recombination in insect cells. Bv-α1PI, bv-TBG, and the three chimeras were efficiently secreted by the insect cells with similar expression levels of up to 5 μg/ml after 60 h in serum-free medium. The structural integrity of the proteins was evident by their reaction with specific polyclonal anti-α1PI and anti-TBG antibodies, whereas there was no detectable cross-reactivity between bv-TBG, bv-α1PI, or wild type baculovirus with these antisera. Chimera P1T2P3–4 and, to a lesser extent, P1T2P3T4retained the inhibitory properties of α1PI and formed SDS-stable complexes with HLE (Fig. 3). P1T2P3–4 and P1T2P3T4 showed significantly more cleaved inhibitor than bv-α1PI. The reaction of HLE with P1T2P3T4 was slower than with α1PI, as indicated by the large amount of uncleaved inhibitor at a molar ratio of one. In contrast to the stable reaction products of cleaved bv-α1PI, increasing HLE concentrations led to a loss of detectable P1T2P3T4-HLE complex concomitant with the disappearance of free P1T2P3T4 (Fig. 4). As expected, bv-TBG and P1T2–4 harboring the RSL equivalent of TBG behaved like pure substrates (Fig. 3).Figure 4Digestion of bv-α1PI and P1T2P3T4 at different HLE-to-serpin ratios. Samples were incubated with increasing ratios of HLE to inhibitor (E/I). Reactions were stopped after 20 min by denaturation at 95 °C in 0.1% SDS. The fraction of complexed P1T2P3T4 was smaller and less stable than that of bv-α1PI.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The residual proteolytic activity of HLE preincubated with increasing amounts of the inhibitors showed a linear dependence characteristic for tight binding inhibition (Fig. 5). The stoichiometries of inhibition (SI), defined as mole of serpin required to inhibit 1 mole of HLE, were 1.3 for bv-α1PI, 2.1 for P1T2P3–4, and 11 for P1T2P3T4. These SI values were in agreement with the reaction products on the immunoblots (Figs. 3 and 4). Again, bv-TBG and P1T2–4showed no inhibition of HLE. Scatchard analysis of T4 binding showed no detectable T4 binding activity (K a < 106m−1) for chimera P1T2P3–4 and the bv-α1PI control. However, in P1T2P3T4, transposition of the complete β-barrel motif into the α1PI frame created a high affinity T4-binding site (K a = 1.7·108m−1), comparable with the first binding site of transthyretin (Fig. 6B). The additional substitution of module 3 in P1T2–4 increased the T4 binding affinity to almost half of that of bv-TBG or human serum TBG (K a = 0.5·1010m−1 versus 1.2·010m−1) (Fig. 6A), although 35% of its residues differed from the wild type TBG sequence. To examine the effect of module exchange on the stability of the chimeras, heat denaturation experiments were performed. Incubation of bv-α1PI and P1T2P3–4 at 60 °C caused a shift in electrophoretic mobility on native PAGE (Fig. 7) compatible with dimerization, as has been previously shown for human serum α1PI (36Lomas D.A. Elliot P.R. Sidhar S.K. Foreman R.C. Finch J.T. Cox D.W. Whisstock J.C. Carrell R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16864-16870Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Bv-TBG and P1T2–4 were not stable at 60 °C. In contrast, P1T2P3T4exhibited neither multimerization nor loss of soluble antigen even at 80 °C. Consistent with the increased conformational stability on native PAGE, P1T2P3T4 displayed no significant decline of T4 binding after incubation at temperatures as high as 85 °C for 20 min (Fig. 8B). However, its inhibitor function was lost at a slightly lower temperature than that of bv-α1PI, starting at 55 °C (Fig. 8C). SDS-PAGE analysis of P1T2P3T4 denatured at 65 °C revealed that this material was still a specific substrate for HLE but did not form a serpin-enzyme complex (data not shown). The inhibitor function of chimera P1T2P3–4 was also less stable than that of bv-α1PI and was completely inactivated at 55 °C. The t1/2 (60 °C) of T4binding of P1T2–4 was reduced to about one-third of the t 1/2 of bv-TBG (Fig. 8A). Genetic engineering has become a mainstay in elucidating the still inadequately understood structure-function correlation of proteins. This information is critical for the understanding of the diversity of proteins and the design of new drugs. In recent years, research has moved from the substitution of single amino acids to the concept of a modular design of proteins. In some proteins, structural and functional units are readily obvious, e.g. the extra- and intracellular and the transmembrane domains of membrane-bound receptors. The identification of discrete units has been used for the successful construction of chimeric receptors (37Kobilka B.K. Kobilka T.S. Daniel K. Regan J.W. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Science. 1988; 240: 1310-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar). However, in chimeras of globular proteins so far only similar functions have been substituted (38Campbell R.K. Bergert E.R. Wang Y. Morris J.C. Moyle W.R. Nat. Biotechnol. 1997; 15: 439-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 39Wakasugi K. Ishimori K. Imai K. Wada Y. Morishima I. J. Biol.

Based on a concept of a modular architecture of the serpins (Fig. 9), we have combined two different functional properties of the serpin superfamily, proteinase inhibition and ligand binding, into one chimeric molecule. The inhibitory and ligand-binding characteristics of the chimeras are summarized in TableII.Table IIInhibitory potency toward HLE and T4 binding affinity of the chimerasSIK amol/mol1010m−1bv-TBG—aNo detectable inhibition.1.2 ± 0.11P1T2–4—aNo detectable inhibition.0.5 ± 0.14P1T2P3T4110.017 ± 0.003P1T2P3–42.1—bNo detectable T4 binding (K a < 106m−1).bv-α1PI1.3—bNo detectable T4 binding (K a < 106m−1).The stoichiometries of inhibition (SI) for the interaction of the chimeras with HLE and affinity constants (K a) for T4 binding were determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.”a No detectable inhibition.b No detectable T4 binding (K a < 106m−1). Open table in a new tab The stoichiometries of inhibition (SI) for the interaction of the chimeras with HLE and affinity constants (K a) for T4 binding were determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.” In chimera P1T2P3T4 the transfer of the T4-binding site of TBG into the α1PI frame was achieved by substituting the β-barrel-like structure of α1PI with its TBG homologue (modules 2 and 4). This chimera exhibited inhibition of and complex formation with HLE, characteristic of inhibitory serpins such as α1PI. In comparison with the archetypical, evolutionarily refined α1PI, it was a weaker inhibitor with a higher apparent stoichiometry of inhibition and a shorter half-life of its complex. In addition to proteinase inhibition, chimera P1T2P3T4 also exhibited a specific, high affinity T4 binding. Although its binding affinity was 70-fold lower than that of TBG, it was still higher than that of transthyretin, the next best natural T4-binding protein. In contrast, the substitution of only module 2 and thus only part of the α1PI β-barrel including the environment of the affinity-labeled Lys253 (24Tabachnick M. Perret V. Biochem. Int. 1987; 15: 409-417PubMed Google Scholar) did not result in detectable T4 binding. Similarly, a chimera harboring only module 4 of TBG produced a dysfunctional, secretion-deficient protein (data not shown). Only the substitution of the complete β-barrel, comprising modules 2 and 4, was sufficient to transfer the high affinity T4-binding site. Consequently, both modules seem to participate in avid T4 binding, in agreement with the demonstration that all parts of the T4 molecule, and thus an extensive surface of interaction of T4 with the binding cavity of TBG, are essential for its high binding affinity (42Snyder S.M. Cavalieri R.R. Goldfine I.D. Ingbar S.H. Jorgensen E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 6489-6494Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, the functional transfer of the T4-binding site of TBG into the α1PI frame unambiguously locates the ligand-binding site to the β-barrel motif of the serpins. Surprisingly, P1T2P3T4remained in solution and retained its T4 binding activity even at remarkably high temperatures (Fig. 8). Serpins tend to polymerize at elevated temperatures (43Patston P.A. Hauert J. Michaud M. Schapira M. FEBS Lett. 1995; 368: 401-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) and simultaneously lose their activity and escape immunodetection as a result of precipitation. Polymerization is thought to involve the insertion of the loop of one serpin molecule into either sheet A (44Lomas D.A. Evans D.L. Finch J.T. Carrell R.W. Nature. 1992; 357: 605-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (876) Google Scholar) or C (21Stein P.E. Carrell R.W. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 96-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar, 45Carrell R.W. Stein P.E. Fermi G. Wardell M.R. Structure. 1994; 2: 257-270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar) of another molecule. Both models require detachment of strand 1 from the C-sheet (46Chang W.S. Whisstock J. Hopkins P.C. Lesk A.M. Carrell R.W. Wardell M.R. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 89-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The extended RSL of chimera P1T2P3T4, which is engineered to be 3 or 7 amino acids longer than in TBG or α1PI, respectively (Fig. 10), most likely delays the heat-induced release of strand 1C from the C-sheet, compatible with the increased thermal resistance of an α1PI variant with a C-terminal extended RSL (48Bottomley S.P. Chang W.-S.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 241: 264-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The discrepancy in the functional stability of T4 bindingversus HLE inhibition of P1T2P3T4 could be the result of a higher intrinsic stability of the β-barrel than the remaining molecule. Significant heat-induced unfolding might occur without affecting the β-barrel and thus T4 binding. However, the cooperativity in the unfolding of serpins (19Bruch M. Weiss V. Engel J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 16626-16630Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 49Powell L.M. Pain R.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 224: 241-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) argues against this possibility. More conceivably, a local structural rearrangement of the RSL is responsible for the observed loss of inhibitory activity at intermediate temperatures. During heat exposure the A-sheet of the serpins is supposed to open up and accept a portion of its own RSL. In P1T2P3T4 this might distort the RSL near the scissile bond, resulting in a pure substrate behavior toward HLE, whereas the extension of the RSL prevents detachment of s1C and hence both polymerization and loss of T4 binding. This limited structural transition of P1T2P3T4 might resemble the spontaneous conversion of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 from an active to a latent conformation in vivo (50Mottonen J. Strand A. Symersky J. Sweet R.M. Danley D.E. Geoghegan K.F. Gerard R.D. Goldsmith E.J. Nature. 1992; 355: 270-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar, 51Levin E.G. Santell L. Blood. 1987; 70: 1090-1098Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In conclusion, the successful construction of a bifunctional chimera clearly demonstrates that ligand binding and proteinase inhibition are not exclusive within the serpin structure and provides evidence for their proposed modular architecture. Moreover, because our approach does not rely on specific features of the serpins but rather uses general design criteria such as compactness of modules and sequence conservation at fusion points, it appears not to be limited to this protein superfamily. There are many examples in which unrelated functions have evolved within a conserved structural scaffold (52Qasba P.K. Safaya S.K. Nature. 1984; 308: 377-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 53Murzin A.G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 403-405Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 54Wistow G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 301-306Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar), occasionally recruiting different portions of a molecule as reactive centers (55Nitta K. Sugai S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 182: 111Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 56Murzin A.G. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1998; 8: 380-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Thus the exchange of homologous modules offers vast possibilities for the design of chimeric proteins with new functional properties. Furthermore, the integration of two functions in one globular protein suggests the potential to introduce novel allosteric effects, e.g. modulation of enzymatic activities upon ligand binding.

DNA replication is a semiconservative process in which a DNA polymerase uses one DNA strand as a template for the synthesis of its complementary strand. All DNA polymerases require a preexisting primer to initiate DNA synthesis (1Kornberg A. Baker A. DNA Replication. Freeman, San Francisco1992: 103-106Google Scholar). In many cases, the primer is a short RNA or DNA molecule. In linear DNAs, which are unable to form circular or hairpin structures during replication, replication of the genome ends cannot take place via RNA or DNA priming. Several mechanisms have evolved to solve the problem of initiation of DNA replication in such linear genomes (2Salas M. Miller J.T. Leis J. DePamphilis M.L. DePamphilis M.L. Replication in Eukaryotic Cells. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1996: 131-176Google Scholar). In the case of viral linear genomes, the OH group of a serine, threonine, or tyrosine residue of a terminal protein (TP) 1The abbreviations used are: TP, terminal protein. 1The abbreviations used are: TP, terminal protein. molecule serves as a primer for DNA replication, and as a consequence, the TP molecule becomes covalently attached to the 5′-terminal nucleotide. This mechanism of initiation of replication is called protein priming (reviewed in Ref. 3Salas M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 39-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). Once bound to the DNA, the TP may serve additional functions such as assisting in DNA packaging (4Bjornsti M.A. Reilly B.E. Anderson D.L. J.

Virology. 1986; 155: 474-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). As a step previous to the initiation of replication, TP interacts with the DNA polymerase to form a heterodimer (12Blanco L. Prieto I. Gutiérrez J. Bernad A. Lázaro J.M. Hermoso J.M. Salas M. J. Virol. 1987; 61: 3983-3991Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To distinguish between the different functions of TP, we will refer to the TP bound to the DNA ends as parental TP and the TP in the heterodimer with the DNA polymerase as primer TP. Interaction of primer TP and/or DNA polymerase with parental TP may increase the affinity of the TP/DNA polymerase heterodimer for the origin or could assist the latter for its correct positioning at the origin, which may be important for initiation of DNA replication at the correct position.The protein-priming mechanism of DNA replication has been mainly studied in the Bacillus subtilis bacteriophage φ29 and adenoviruses (see Refs. 2Salas M.

To activate the initiation of replication, dsDNA-binding protein p6 forms a nucleoprotein complex that would help to open the DNA ends (20Serrano M. Salas M. Hermoso J.M. Science. 1990; 248: 1012-1016Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). A primer TP/DNA polymerase heterodimer recognizes the origin of replication, probably through protein-protein interaction of the primer TP and/or φ29 DNA polymerase with the parental TP. Then, the φ29 DNA polymerase catalyzes the addition of the first dAMP (21Blanco L. Salas M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U . S . A. 1984; 81: 5325-5329Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) to the OH group provided by Ser232 of the primer TP (22Hermoso J.M. Méndez E. Soriano F. Salas M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1985; 13: 7715-7728Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The formation of this first TP-dAMP is directed by the second nucleotide at the 3′-end of the template and then slides back one nucleotide to recover the terminal nucleotide (23Méndez J. Blanco L. Esteban J.A. Bernad A. Salas M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U . S . A. 1992; 89: 9579-9583Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Following initiation, the same φ29 DNA polymerase molecule completes replication of the parental strand.φ29 parental TP is an important requirement for in vitroinitiation of φ29 DNA replication (24Garcı́a J.A. Peñalva M.A. Blanco L. Salas M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U . S . A. 1984; 81: 80-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Two lines of evidence show that parental TP is also required in vivo. First, in a mixed infection experiment at 42 °C using phages that have a thermosensitive (ts) mutation in either gene 2 (encoding the DNA polymerase) or gene 3 (encoding TP), most of the phage progeny had the ts2 genotype (16Salas M. Mellado R.P. Viñuela E. Sogo J.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1978; 119: 269-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), and second, successful transfection required an intact gene 3 product (17Peñalva M.A. Salas M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U . S .

Cozzarelli N.R. Mechanisms of DNA Replication and Recombination. Alan R. Liss Inc., New York1983: 203-223Google Scholar). Moreover, formation of the TP-dAMP initiation complex was obtained using as template the TP-DNA isolated from the closely related Bacillus phage ø15 but not from the more distantly related Bacillus phage GA-1 or the pneumococcal phage Cp-1. The lack of activity in the initiation reaction of the TP-DNA isolated from these latter two phages could be because of differences in the parental TPs (24Garcı́a J.A. Peñalva M.A. Blanco L. Salas M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U . S . A. 1984; 81: 80-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar).Structure-function studies and biochemical characterization of φ29 TP provide a basis to gain insight about the different roles of this protein in φ29 DNA replication. As shown here, a mutational analysis of φ29 TP at conserved amino acids from positions 61 to 87 revealed that residues Asn80 and Tyr82 are important for recognition of the origin of replication. The results obtained indicate that parental TP plays an important role as a structural part of the replication origin through functional interactions with the primer TP. DNA replication is a semiconservative process in which a DNA polymerase uses one DNA strand as a template for the synthesis of its complementary strand. All DNA polymerases require a preexisting primer to initiate DNA synthesis (1Kornberg A. Baker A. DNA Replication. Freeman, San Francisco1992: 103-106Google Scholar). In many cases, the primer is a short RNA or DNA molecule. In linear DNAs, which are unable to form circular or hairpin structures during replication, replication of the genome ends cannot take place via RNA or DNA priming. Several mechanisms have evolved to solve the problem of initiation of DNA replication in such linear genomes (2Salas M. Miller J.T. Leis J. DePamphilis M.L. DePamphilis M.L. Replication in Eukaryotic Cells. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1996: 131-176Google Scholar). In the case of viral linear genomes, the OH group of a serine, threonine, or tyrosine residue of a terminal protein (TP) 1The abbreviations used are: TP, terminal protein. 1The abbreviations used are: TP, terminal protein. molecule serves as a primer for DNA replication, and as a consequence, the TP molecule becomes covalently attached to the 5′-terminal nucleotide. This mechanism of initiation of replication is called protein priming (reviewed in Ref. 3Salas M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 39-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). Once bound to the DNA, the TP may serve additional functions such as assisting in DNA packaging (4Bjornsti M.A. Reilly B.E. Anderson D.L. J. Virol. 1982; 41: 508-517Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Grimes S. Anderson D. J. Mol.

Virol. 1983; 48: 721-730Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), stimulation of template activity (9Pronk R. Stuvier M.H. van der Vliet P.C. Chromosoma (Berl.). 1992; 102: 39-45Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar), matrix attachment (10Schaack J. Yew-Wai Ho J. Freimuth P. Shenk T. Gene (Amst.). 1990; 4: 1197-1208Google Scholar), stimulation of transcription (10Schaack J. Yew-Wai Ho J. Freimuth P. Shenk T. Gene (Amst.). 1990; 4: 1197-1208Google Scholar), and recruitment of a new TP to the origin (11Gutiérrez J. Vinós J. Prieto I. Méndez E. Hermoso J.M. Salas M. Virology. 1986; 155: 474-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). As a step previous to the initiation of replication, TP interacts with the DNA polymerase to form a heterodimer (12Blanco L. Prieto I. Gutiérrez J. Bernad A. Lázaro J.M. Hermoso J.M. Salas M. J. Virol. 1987; 61: 3983-3991Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To distinguish between the different functions of TP, we will refer to the TP bound to the DNA ends as parental TP and the TP in the heterodimer with the DNA polymerase as primer TP. Interaction of primer TP and/or DNA polymerase with parental TP may increase the affinity of the TP/DNA polymerase heterodimer for the origin or could assist the latter for its correct positioning at the origin, which may be important for initiation of DNA replication at the correct position. The protein-priming mechanism of DNA replication has been mainly studied in the Bacillus subtilis bacteriophage φ29 and adenoviruses (see Refs. 2Salas M. Miller J.T. Leis J. DePamphilis M.L.

The gene has therefore been named striamin. Its expression was confined to skeletal muscle types with a fast glycolytic (2B) contractile phenotype. It was also detected in C2C12 mouse myoblasts and was down-regulated during in vitro myogenesis. The cDNA has a single open reading frame encoding a predicted 16.8-kDa protein of 149 amino acids with no homology to known proteins. Microinjection and transfection of green fluorescence protein-taggedstriamin demonstrated that it localizes to the nucleus. Coimmunoprecipitations revealed that it can interact with p53 (a positive marker for myoblast differentiation) in vivo andin vitro. Furthermore, it repressed p53 activity in p53-mediated reporter assays.

Several genes, such as muscle creatine kinase, troponins, caveolin-3, α-actin, and myosin, have been reported to be predominantly expressed in skeletal muscle. A family of muscle-specific transcription factors such as myoD, myogenin, myf-5, and MRF-4/herculin/myf-6 that regulate muscle-specific gene expression has also been cloned. These are phosphorylated nuclear proteins, containing helix-loop-helix motifs required for dimerization and DNA binding, that can determine a specific cellular differentiation program (1Olson E.N. Klein W.H. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar). The myoD family of transcription factors has been shown to direct myogenesis, repress proliferation, activate differentiation, and induce contractile phenotypes. The introduction of any one of these into nonmyogenic cells induces their differentiation into mature muscle cells (2Weintraub H. Davis R. Tapscott S. Thayer M. Krause M. Benezra R. Blackwell T.K. Turner D. Rupp R. Hollenberg S. Zhuang Y. Lassar A.B. Science. 1991; 251: 761-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (1226) Google Scholar). The MyoD and myf-5 are expressed in proliferating myoblasts whereas myogenin and MRF-4 are not expressed until myoblasts exit the cell cycle in response to mitogen depletion. Therefore, myoD and myf-5 have been im- plicated as having a role in proliferating myoblasts whereas myogenin and MRF-4 have been shown to activate and maintain muscle gene expression (3Emerson C.P.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1993; 5: 1057-1064Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In addition, the cell cycle regulatory proteins such as RB (4Shiio Y. Sawada J.I. Handa H. Yamamoto T. Inoue J.I.

Biochem. 1995; 231: 282-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) have also been assigned a positive role in myogenic differentiation.While looking for genes involved in senescence and immortalization, we fortuitously cloned a novel gene that is specifically expressed in fast twitch skeletal muscles. The gene is named “striamin” because of its specific expression in striated muscle. Cloning of the cDNA, expression analyses, subcellular localization, chromosomal assignment, its interactions with the tumor suppressor p53, and its possible significance during muscle differentiation are reported herein.DISCUSSIONHere we report cloning and characterization of a novel gene,striamin, whose expression is restricted to the striated muscles. The expression pattern of striamin shares features in common with a few other genes, but is most similar to that of MyoD. Both are expressed in proliferating myoblasts, decline during differentiation, and yet are present in adult skeletal muscle (26Hughes S.M. Taylor J.M. Tapscott S.J. Gurley C.M. Carter W.J. Peterson C.A. Development. 1993; 118: 1137-1147Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, they appear to be preferentially expressed in fast glycolytic muscle fibers in the adult mouse (27Hughes S.M. Koishi K. Rudnicki M. Maggs A.M. Mech. Dev. 1997; 61: 151-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). In adult myofibers myoD is thought to mediate innervation and thyroid hormone effects on fiber type-specific gene expression (26Hughes S.M. Taylor J.M. Tapscott S.J. Gurley C.M. Carter W.J. Peterson C.A. Development. 1993; 118: 1137-1147Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) as well as repress slow isoform gene function (28Goblet C. Whalen R.G. Dev. Biol. 1995; 170: 262-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Other genes that are specific to fast glycolytic fiber include myosin heavy chain 2B (MyHC 2B) (reviewed in Ref. 29Schiaffino S. Reggiani C. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 371-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (1263) Google Scholar) and a muscle-specific form of the glycolytic enzyme aldolase A (M-aldA) (30Colbert M.C. Ciejeck-Baez E. Dev. Biol. 1992; 149: 66-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Therefore, striamin may function as a mediator of extrinsic factors on gene expression in fast glycolytic fibers, as a determinant of metabolism, or as a determinant of muscle contractile activity.Adult skeletal muscle can undergo regeneration, repair, and growth in response to injury or various stresses (31Antonio J. Gonyea W.J. Med. Sci. Sports Exercise. 1993; 25: 1333-1345Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar, 32Grounds M.D. Yablonka-Reuveni Z. Partridge T. Molecular and Cell Biology of Muscular Dystrophy. Chapman & Hall, London1993: 210-256Crossref Scopus (170) Google Scholar). These processes are achieved by the activation of muscle precursor or satellite cells. In normal skeletal muscle, satellite cells are mitotically quiescent, mononucleated cells that are situated between the basement membrane and the myofiber plasma membrane. Injury or stress results in the mitotic activation of the satellite cells, which proliferate and fuse to repair damaged fibers or increase the size of existing fibers. The progression from proliferating to fusion competent satellite cells is marked by a precise order of expression of myogenic regulatory factors and muscle structural proteins. This includes, in order, MyoD, myogenin, α-smooth muscle actin, and sarcomeric myosin (33Yablonka-Reuveni Z. Rivera A.J. Dev. Biol. 1994; 164: 588-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). Becausestriamin is expressed in myoblasts in culture, it is a candidate marker for activated satellite cells and may play a role in the differentiation process in vivo.striamin is expressed in mouse, but not in human, heart. Differences exist between rodent and human cardiac myofibers in contraction velocities and force production, which in large part reflects the ATPase activity conferred by the MyHC isoform present (34Swynghedauw B. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 66: 710-771Crossref Scopus (526) Google Scholar). α-MyHC, the predominant isoform in the rodent heart, confers a faster shortening velocity and low efficiency of force production. In contrast, β-MyHC predominates in the human heart, which has a slower shortening velocity and high efficiency of force production. Rodent and human hearts also differ in the relative amounts of sarcomeric actins present, cardiac and skeletal actin (35Gunning P. Ponte P. Blau H. Kedes L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1983; 3: 1985-1995Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 36Boheler K.R. Carrier L. de la Bastie D. Allen P.D. Komajda M. Mercadier J.-J. Schwartz K. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 88: 323-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), which most likely reflects a difference in force development (37Hewett T.E. Grupp I.L. Grupp G. Robbins J. Circ. Res. 1994; 74: 740-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The combinations of MyHCs and sarcomeric actins in rodent versus human heart results in a rodent heart that is more similar in contractile properties to a fast-twitch skeletal muscle fiber, whereas the opposite is true for the human heart. Therefore, the expression ofstriamin in striated muscles and mouse heart is consistent with a role in a fast contractile phenotype.striamin Was Found to Interact with p53 in Vitro and in VivoRepression of p53 activity by striamin is consistent with its down-regulation during in vitromyogenesis when significant increase in p53 activity has been reported (22Prokocimer M. Rotter V. Blood. 1994; 84: 2391-2411Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These data suggests that striamin may affect myogenesis via a direct interaction with p53. Our data suggested that both the N- and C-terminal halves of striamin protein can bind to p53; however, it is the C terminus of striamin that represses transcriptional activity of p53. This suggests that there are more than one p53 binding sites in striamin protein andvice versa. Characterization of these warrant further studies.The myogenic differentiation program includes activation of myogenic transcription factors, intercellular fusion of myoblasts, their withdrawal from the cell cycle, and terminal differentiation to myotubes. Besides the muscle-specific family of transcription factors, myoD family, several adhesion molecules such as N-CAM, N-cadherin, very late activation antigen 4, vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1), and meltrin-α have been implicated in this process (38Dickson G.

Of particular interest are its fast fiber specificity, nuclear localization, down-regulation with myogenic differentiation, and functional interactions with the tumor suppressor p53, which may predict it to be an important gene in the regulation of the myogenic differentiation program and warrant further studies to elucidate its role in myogenesis and the fast contractile phenotype. Several genes, such as muscle creatine kinase, troponins, caveolin-3, α-actin, and myosin, have been reported to be predominantly expressed in skeletal muscle. A family of muscle-specific transcription factors such as myoD, myogenin, myf-5, and MRF-4/herculin/myf-6 that regulate muscle-specific gene expression has also been cloned. These are phosphorylated nuclear proteins, containing helix-loop-helix motifs required for dimerization and DNA binding, that can determine a specific cellular differentiation program (1Olson E.N. Klein W.H. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar). The myoD family of transcription factors has been shown to direct myogenesis, repress proliferation, activate differentiation, and induce contractile phenotypes. The introduction of any one of these into nonmyogenic cells induces their differentiation into mature muscle cells (2Weintraub H. Davis R. Tapscott S. Thayer M. Krause M. Benezra R. Blackwell T.K. Turner D. Rupp R. Hollenberg S. Zhuang Y. Lassar A.B. Science. 1991; 251: 761-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (1226) Google Scholar). The MyoD and myf-5 are expressed in proliferating myoblasts whereas myogenin and MRF-4 are not expressed until myoblasts exit the cell cycle in response to mitogen depletion. Therefore, myoD and myf-5 have been im- plicated as having a role in proliferating myoblasts whereas myogenin and MRF-4 have been shown to activate and maintain muscle gene expression (3Emerson C.P.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1993; 5: 1057-1064Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In addition, the cell cycle regulatory proteins such as RB (4Shiio Y. Sawada J.I. Handa H. Yamamoto T. Inoue J.I.

Recently, caveolin-3, α-dystroglycan, and DNA methyltransferase (9Song K.S. Scherer P.E Tang Z. Okamoto T. Li S. Chafel M. Chu D. Kohtz D.S. Lisanti M.P. J.

Asano A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 231: 282-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) have also been assigned a positive role in myogenic differentiation. While looking for genes involved in senescence and immortalization, we fortuitously cloned a novel gene that is specifically expressed in fast twitch skeletal muscles. The gene is named “striamin” because of its specific expression in striated muscle. Cloning of the cDNA, expression analyses, subcellular localization, chromosomal assignment, its interactions with the tumor suppressor p53, and its possible significance during muscle differentiation are reported herein. DISCUSSIONHere we report cloning and characterization of a novel gene,striamin, whose expression is restricted to the striated muscles. The expression pattern of striamin shares features in common with a few other genes, but is most similar to that of MyoD. Both are expressed in proliferating myoblasts, decline during differentiation, and yet are present in adult skeletal muscle (26Hughes S.M. Taylor J.M. Tapscott S.J. Gurley C.M. Carter W.J. Peterson C.A. Development. 1993; 118: 1137-1147Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, they appear to be preferentially expressed in fast glycolytic muscle fibers in the adult mouse (27Hughes S.M. Koishi K. Rudnicki M. Maggs A.M. Mech. Dev. 1997; 61: 151-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). In adult myofibers myoD is thought to mediate innervation and thyroid hormone effects on fiber type-specific gene expression (26Hughes S.M. Taylor J.M. Tapscott S.J. Gurley C.M. Carter W.J. Peterson C.A. Development. 1993; 118: 1137-1147Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) as well as repress slow isoform gene function (28Goblet C. Whalen R.G. Dev. Biol. 1995; 170: 262-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Other genes that are specific to fast glycolytic fiber include myosin heavy chain 2B (MyHC 2B) (reviewed in Ref. 29Schiaffino S. Reggiani C. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 371-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (1263) Google Scholar) and a muscle-specific form of the glycolytic enzyme aldolase A (M-aldA) (30Colbert M.C. Ciejeck-Baez E. Dev. Biol. 1992; 149: 66-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Therefore, striamin may function as a mediator of extrinsic factors on gene expression in fast glycolytic fibers, as a determinant of metabolism, or as a determinant of muscle contractile activity.Adult skeletal muscle can undergo regeneration, repair, and growth in response to injury or various stresses (31Antonio J. Gonyea W.J. Med. Sci. Sports Exercise. 1993; 25: 1333-1345Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar, 32Grounds M.D. Yablonka-Reuveni Z. Partridge T. Molecular and Cell Biology of Muscular Dystrophy. Chapman & Hall, London1993: 210-256Crossref Scopus (170) Google Scholar). These processes are achieved by the activation of muscle precursor or satellite cells. In normal skeletal muscle, satellite cells are mitotically quiescent, mononucleated cells that are situated between the basement membrane and the myofiber plasma membrane. Injury or stress results in the mitotic activation of the satellite cells, which proliferate and fuse to repair damaged fibers or increase the size of existing fibers. The progression from proliferating to fusion competent satellite cells is marked by a precise order of expression of myogenic regulatory factors and muscle structural proteins. This includes, in order, MyoD, myogenin, α-smooth muscle actin, and sarcomeric myosin (33Yablonka-Reuveni Z. Rivera A.J. Dev. Biol. 1994; 164: 588-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). Becausestriamin is expressed in myoblasts in culture, it is a candidate marker for activated satellite cells and may play a role in the differentiation process in vivo.striamin is expressed in mouse, but not in human, heart. Differences exist between rodent and human cardiac myofibers in contraction velocities and force production, which in large part reflects the ATPase activity conferred by the MyHC isoform present (34Swynghedauw B. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 66: 710-771Crossref Scopus (526) Google Scholar). α-MyHC, the predominant isoform in the rodent heart, confers a faster shortening velocity and low efficiency of force production. In contrast, β-MyHC predominates in the human heart, which has a slower shortening velocity and high efficiency of force production. Rodent and human hearts also differ in the relative amounts of sarcomeric actins present, cardiac and skeletal actin (35Gunning P. Ponte P. Blau H. Kedes L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1983; 3: 1985-1995Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 36Boheler K.R. Carrier L. de la Bastie D. Allen P.D. Komajda M. Mercadier J.-J. Schwartz K. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 88: 323-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), which most likely reflects a difference in force development (37Hewett T.E. Grupp I.L. Grupp G. Robbins J. Circ. Res. 1994; 74: 740-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The combinations of MyHCs and sarcomeric actins in rodent versus human heart results in a rodent heart that is more similar in contractile properties to a fast-twitch skeletal muscle fiber, whereas the opposite is true for the human heart. Therefore, the expression ofstriamin in striated muscles and mouse heart is consistent with a role in a fast contractile phenotype.striamin Was Found to Interact with p53 in Vitro and in VivoRepression of p53 activity by striamin is consistent with its down-regulation during in vitromyogenesis when significant increase in p53 activity has been reported (22Prokocimer M. Rotter V. Blood. 1994; 84: 2391-2411Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These data suggests that striamin may affect myogenesis via a direct interaction with p53. Our data suggested that both the N- and C-terminal halves of striamin protein can bind to p53; however, it is the C terminus of striamin that represses transcriptional activity of p53. This suggests that there are more than one p53 binding sites in striamin protein andvice versa. Characterization of these warrant further studies.The myogenic differentiation program includes activation of myogenic transcription factors, intercellular fusion of myoblasts, their withdrawal from the cell cycle, and terminal differentiation to myotubes. Besides the muscle-specific family of transcription factors, myoD family, several adhesion molecules such as N-CAM, N-cadherin, very late activation antigen 4, vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1), and meltrin-α have been implicated in this process (38Dickson G.

Of particular interest are its fast fiber specificity, nuclear localization, down-regulation with myogenic differentiation, and functional interactions with the tumor suppressor p53, which may predict it to be an important gene in the regulation of the myogenic differentiation program and warrant further studies to elucidate its role in myogenesis and the fast contractile phenotype. Repression of p53 activity by striamin is consistent with its down-regulation during in vitromyogenesis when significant increase in p53 activity has been reported (22Prokocimer M. Rotter V. Blood. 1994; 84: 2391-2411Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These data suggests that striamin may affect myogenesis via a direct interaction with p53. Our data suggested that both the N- and C-terminal halves of striamin protein can bind to p53; however, it is the C terminus of striamin that represses transcriptional activity of p53. This suggests that there are more than one p53 binding sites in striamin protein andvice versa. Characterization of these warrant further studies. The myogenic differentiation program includes activation of myogenic transcription factors, intercellular fusion of myoblasts, their withdrawal from the cell cycle, and terminal differentiation to myotubes. Besides the muscle-specific family of transcription factors, myoD family, several adhesion molecules such as N-CAM, N-cadherin, very late activation antigen 4, vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1), and meltrin-α have been implicated in this process (38Dickson G.
