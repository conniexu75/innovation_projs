https://openalex.org/W2047043150,"Cardiovascular disease remains the leading cause of mortality in westernized countries, despite optimum medical therapy to reduce the levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-associated cholesterol. The pursuit of novel therapies to target the residual risk has focused on raising the levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-associated cholesterol in order to exploit its atheroprotective effects. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have emerged as important post-transcriptional regulators of lipid metabolism and are thus a new class of target for therapeutic intervention. MicroRNA-33a and microRNA-33b (miR-33a/b) are intronic miRNAs whose encoding regions are embedded in the sterol-response-element-binding protein genes SREBF2 and SREBF1 (refs 3-5), respectively. These miRNAs repress expression of the cholesterol transporter ABCA1, which is a key regulator of HDL biogenesis. Recent studies in mice suggest that antagonizing miR-33a may be an effective strategy for raising plasma HDL levels and providing protection against atherosclerosis; however, extrapolating these findings to humans is complicated by the fact that mice lack miR-33b, which is present only in the SREBF1 gene of medium and large mammals. Here we show in African green monkeys that systemic delivery of an anti-miRNA oligonucleotide that targets both miR-33a and miR-33b increased hepatic expression of ABCA1 and induced a sustained increase in plasma HDL levels over 12 weeks. Notably, miR-33 antagonism in this non-human primate model also increased the expression of miR-33 target genes involved in fatty acid oxidation (CROT, CPT1A, HADHB and PRKAA1) and reduced the expression of genes involved in fatty acid synthesis (SREBF1, FASN, ACLY and ACACA), resulting in a marked suppression of the plasma levels of very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL)-associated triglycerides, a finding that has not previously been observed in mice. These data establish, in a model that is highly relevant to humans, that pharmacological inhibition of miR-33a and miR-33b is a promising therapeutic strategy to raise plasma HDL and lower VLDL triglyceride levels for the treatment of dyslipidaemias that increase cardiovascular disease risk."
https://openalex.org/W2095102047,"Chromatin modifiers regulate lifespan in several organisms, raising the question of whether changes in chromatin states in the parental generation could be incompletely reprogrammed in the next generation and thereby affect the lifespan of descendants. The histone H3 lysine 4 trimethylation (H3K4me3) complex, composed of ASH-2, WDR-5 and the histone methyltransferase SET-2, regulates Caenorhabditis elegans lifespan. Here we show that deficiencies in the H3K4me3 chromatin modifiers ASH-2, WDR-5 or SET-2 in the parental generation extend the lifespan of descendants up until the third generation. The transgenerational inheritance of lifespan extension by members of the ASH-2 complex is dependent on the H3K4me3 demethylase RBR-2, and requires the presence of a functioning germline in the descendants. Transgenerational inheritance of lifespan is specific for the H3K4me3 methylation complex and is associated with epigenetic changes in gene expression. Thus, manipulation of specific chromatin modifiers only in parents can induce an epigenetic memory of longevity in descendants."

https://openalex.org/W2072075600,"Intelligence quotient (IQ) is a standardized measure of human intellectual capacity that takes into account a wide range of cognitive skills. IQ is generally considered to be stable across the lifespan, with scores at one time point used to predict educational achievement and employment prospects in later years. Neuroimaging allows us to test whether unexpected longitudinal fluctuations in measured IQ are related to brain development. Here we show that verbal and non-verbal IQ can rise or fall in the teenage years, with these changes in performance validated by their close correlation with changes in local brain structure. A combination of structural and functional imaging showed that verbal IQ changed with grey matter in a region that was activated by speech, whereas non-verbal IQ changed with grey matter in a region that was activated by finger movements. By using longitudinal assessments of the same individuals, we obviated the many sources of variation in brain structure that confound cross-sectional studies. This allowed us to dissociate neural markers for the two types of IQ and to show that general verbal and non-verbal abilities are closely linked to the sensorimotor skills involved in learning. More generally, our results emphasize the possibility that an individual's intellectual capacity relative to their peers can decrease or increase in the teenage years. This would be encouraging to those whose intellectual potential may improve, and would be a warning that early achievers may not maintain their potential."

https://openalex.org/W1978051650,"Mechanisms that regulate endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-induced apoptosis in cancer cells remain enigmatic. Recent data suggest that ceramide synthase1-6 (CerS1-6)-generated ceramides, containing different fatty acid chain lengths, might exhibit distinct and opposing functions, such as apoptosis versus survival in a context-dependent manner. Here, we investigated the mechanisms involved in the activation of one of the major ER stress response proteins, ATF-6, and subsequent apoptosis by alterations of CerS6/C(16)-ceramide. Induction of wild type (WT), but not the catalytically inactive mutant CerS6, increased tumor growth in SCID mice, whereas siRNA-mediated knockdown of CerS6 induced ATF-6 activation and apoptosis in multiple human cancer cells. Down-regulation of CerS6/C(16)-ceramide, and not its further metabolism to glucosylceramide or sphingomyelin, activated ATF-6 upon treatment with ER stress inducers tunicamycin or SAHA (suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid). Induction of WT-CerS6 expression, but not its mutant, or ectopic expression of the dominant-negative mutant form of ATF-6 protected cells from apoptosis in response to CerS6 knockdown and tunicamycin or SAHA treatment. Mechanistically, ATF-6 activation was regulated by a concerted two-step process involving the release of Ca(2+) from the ER stores ([Ca(2+)](ER)), which resulted in the fragmentation of Golgi membranes in response to CerS6/C(16)-ceramide alteration. This resulted in the accumulation of pro-ATF-6 in the disrupted ER/Golgi membrane network, where pro-ATF6 is activated. Accordingly, ectopic expression of a Ca(2+) chelator calbindin prevented the Golgi fragmentation, ATF-6 activation, and apoptosis in response to CerS6/C(16)-ceramide down-regulation. Overall, these data suggest a novel mechanism of how CerS6/C(16)-ceramide alteration activates ATF6 and induces ER-stress-mediated apoptosis in squamous cell carcinomas."
https://openalex.org/W1995591233,"Hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) channels are dually activated by hyperpolarization and binding of cAMP to their cyclic nucleotide binding domain (CNBD). HCN isoforms respond differently to cAMP; binding of cAMP shifts activation of HCN2 and HCN4 by 17 mV but shifts that of HCN1 by only 2-4 mV. To explain the peculiarity of HCN1, we solved the crystal structures and performed a biochemical-biophysical characterization of the C-terminal domain (C-linker plus CNBD) of the three isoforms. Our main finding is that tetramerization of the C-terminal domain of HCN1 occurs at basal cAMP concentrations, whereas those of HCN2 and HCN4 require cAMP saturating levels. Therefore, HCN1 responds less markedly than HCN2 and HCN4 to cAMP increase because its CNBD is already partly tetrameric. This is confirmed by voltage clamp experiments showing that the right-shifted position of V(&frac12;) in HCN1 is correlated with its propensity to tetramerize in vitro. These data underscore that ligand-induced CNBD tetramerization removes tonic inhibition from the pore of HCN channels."
https://openalex.org/W2059580548,"Obesity, a major health concern, results from an imbalance between energy intake and expenditure. Leptin-deficient ob/ob mice are paradigmatic of obesity, resulting from excess energy intake and storage. Mice lacking acyl-CoA oxidase 1 (Acox1), the first enzyme of the peroxisomal fatty acid β-oxidation system, are characterized by increased energy expenditure and a lean body phenotype caused by sustained activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα) by endogenous ligands in liver that remain unmetabolized in the absence of Acox1. We generated ob/ob mice deficient in Acox1 (Acox1(-/-)) to determine how the activation of PPARα by endogenous ligands might affect the obesity of ob/ob mice. In contrast to Acox1(-/-) (14.3±1.2 g at 6 mo) and the Acox1-deficient (ob/ob) double-mutant mice (23.8±4.6 g at 6 mo), the ob/ob mice are severely obese (54.3±3.2 g at 6 mo) and had significantly more (P<0.01) epididymal fat content. The resistance of Acox1(-/-)/ob/ob mice to obesity is due to increased PPARα-mediated up-regulation of genes involved in fatty acid oxidation in liver. Activation of PPARα in Acox1-deficient ob/ob mice also reduces serum glucose and insulin (P<0.05) and improves glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity. Further, PPARα activation reduces hepatic steatosis and increases hepatocellular regenerative response in Acox1(-/-)/ob/ob mice at a more accelerated pace than in mice lacking only Acox1. However, Acox1(-/-)/ob/ob mice manifest hepatic endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and also develop hepatocellular carcinomas (8 of 8 mice) similar to those observed in Acox1(-/-) mice (10 of 10 mice), but unlike in ob/ob (0 of 14 mice) and OB/OB (0 of 6 mice) mice, suggesting that superimposed ER stress and PPARα activation contribute to carcinogenesis in a fatty liver. Finally, absence of Acox1 in ob/ob mice can impart resistance to high-fat diet (60% fat)-induced obesity, and their liver had significantly (P<0.01) more cell proliferation. These studies with Acox1(-/-)/ob/ob mice indicate that sustained activation of lipid-sensing nuclear receptor PPARα attenuates obesity and restores glucose homeostasis by ameliorating insulin resistance but increases the risk for liver cancer development, in part related to excess energy combustion."
https://openalex.org/W2163205164,"Breast cancer cells often develop multiple mechanisms of drug resistance during tumor progression, which is the major reason for the failure of breast cancer therapy. High constitutive activation of NFκB has been found in different cancers, creating an environment conducive for chemotherapeutic resistance. Here we report that doxorubicin-induced SMAR1-dependent transcriptional repression and SMAR1-independent degradation of IkBα resulted in nuclear translocation of p65NFκB and its association with p300 histone acetylase and subsequent transcription of Bcl-2 to impart protective response in drug-resistant cells. Consistently SMAR1-silenced drug-resistant cells exhibited IkBα-mediated inhibition of p65NFκB and induction of p53-dependent apoptosis. Interestingly, curcumin pretreatment of drug-resistant cells alleviated SMAR1-mediated p65NFκB activation and hence restored doxorubicin sensitivity. Under such anti-survival condition, induction of p53-p300 cross-talk enhanced the transcriptional activity of p53 and intrinsic death cascade. Importantly, promyelocyte leukemia-mediated SMAR1 sequestration that relieved the repression of apoptosis-inducing genes was indispensable for such chemo-sensitizing ability of curcumin. A simultaneous decrease in drug-induced systemic toxicity by curcumin might also have enhanced the efficacy of doxorubicin by improving the intrinsic defense machineries of the tumor-bearer. Overall, the findings of this preclinical study clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of curcumin to combat doxorubicin-resistance. We, therefore, suggest curcumin as a potent chemo-sensitizer to improve the therapeutic index of this widely used anti-cancer drug. Taken together, these results suggest that curcumin can be developed into an adjuvant chemotherapeutic drug.

Taken together, these results suggest that curcumin can be developed into an adjuvant chemotherapeutic drug. Although chemotherapy plays an important role in the treatment of breast cancer, the high percentage of non-responders and of failures after initial responses highlights the critical role played by drug resistance mechanisms in breast cancer management (1Chintamani Tandon M. Mishra A. Agarwal U. Saxena S. World J. Surg. Oncol. 2011; 9: 19Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Mechanistically, the resistance phenomena may be explained by (i) mutation or overexpression of drug target proteins and/or (ii) inactivation of drugs by a reduction in uptake or enhanced detoxification and removal of drugs. Doxorubicin, an anthracycline antibiotic, is one of the commonly prescribed chemotherapeutic agents against a wide-spectrum of cancers including breast cancer (2Campbell K.J. O'Shea J.M. Perkins N.D. BMC Cancer. 2006; 6: 101Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). However, the clinical efficacy and usefulness of doxorubicin-based treatment regimens is still limited because of dose-limiting toxicity and induction of drug resistance (3Arafa el-S.A. Zhu Q. Shah Z.I. Wani G. Barakat B.M. Racoma I. El-Mahdy M.A. Wani A.A. Mutat. Res. 2011; 706: 28-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop new sensitizing agents that enhance the efficacy of doxorubicin and circumvent chemoresistance. Resistance to the apoptotic effect of doxorubicin is speculated to be multifactorial, involving the activation of nuclear factor κB in cancer cells (4Liu X. Wang B. Ma X. Guo Y. Jpn. J. Clin. Oncol. 2009; 39: 418-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Coincidently NFκB 3The abbreviations used are: NFκBnuclear factor κBBaxBcl-2-associated X proteinBcl-2B cell lymphoma 2BNPB-type natriuretic peptideEACEhrlich ascites carcinomaLD50lethal dose 50scaffoldsmall matrix-associated region-binding proteinPMLpromyelocyte leukemiaCBPcAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB)-binding protein7AAD7-aminoactinomycin DPEphosphatidylethanolamineDoxdoxorubicinDiOC63,3'-dihexyloxacarbocyanine iodide. is constitutively active in human breast cancer tissues and breast cancer cell lines (5Gionet N. Jansson D. Mader S. Pratt M.A. J. Cell. Biochem. 2009; 107: 448-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Moreover, it is proposed to be one of the early events in breast oncogenesis, as shown by early NFκB DNA binding in neoplastic transformation of mammary cells. Consequently in studies by Montagut et al. (6Montagut C. Tusquets I. Ferrer B. Corominas J.M. Bellosillo B. Campas C. Suarez M. Fabregat X. Campo E. Gascon P. Serrano S. Fernandez P.L. Rovira A. Albanell J. Endocr. Relat. Cancer. 2006; 13: 607-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) activation of NFκB in breast cancer pre-chemotherapy specimens was found to be a predictive factor of chemoresistance. It has been shown that activation of the NFκB pathway renders many types of tumor cells more resistant to chemotherapy presumably via induction of anti-apoptotic proteins (7Baud V. Karin M. Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2009; 8: 33-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (878) Google Scholar). Therefore, inhibition of the NFκB has been extensively exploited as a novel approach to sensitize cancers to chemotherapy but has achieved mixed results (7Baud V. Karin M. Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2009; 8: 33-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (878) Google Scholar). Therefore, further studies are urgently needed to gain a better understanding of how manipulation of the NFκB pathway regulates breast tumor cell sensitivity to chemotherapy and to identify compounds that suppress the NFκB pathway before a molecular-targeted therapy can be effectively employed for breast cancer treatment. nuclear factor κB Bcl-2-associated X protein B cell lymphoma 2 B-type natriuretic peptide Ehrlich ascites carcinoma lethal dose 50 small matrix-associated region-binding protein promyelocyte leukemia cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB)-binding protein 7-aminoactinomycin D phosphatidylethanolamine doxorubicin 3,3'-dihexyloxacarbocyanine iodide. In contrast to NFκB, the transcription factor p53 is a first-line tumor suppressor induced by stimuli endangering genome integrity (8Ryan K.M. Eur. J. Cancer. 2011; 47: 44-50Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The exact regulation of p53-mediated cell cycle arrest or apoptosis is complex and depends on the cellular context and specific stress stimuli (8Ryan K.M. Eur. J. Cancer. 2011; 47: 44-50Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Inactivation of the p53 pathway is observed in most human cancers, with mutations in p53 occurring in at least 50% of all tumors (9Saeki H. Kitao H. Yoshinaga K. Nakanoko T Kubo N. Kakeji Y. Morita M. Maehara Y. Clin. Cancer Res. 2011; 17: 1731-1740Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Interestingly, in addition to the lack of tumor suppressive functions, p53 mutants gain oncogenic activities contributing to carcinogenesis and drug resistance (10Rohwer N. Dame C. Haugstetter A. Wiedenmann B. Detjen K. Schmitt C.A. Cramer T. PLoS One. 2010; 5e12038Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Considering the deregulation of NFκB and p53 pathways in numerous cancers, it is not surprising that an extensive cross-talk between these pathways exists at various levels. In fact, after chemotherapy-induced DNA damage, NFκB was shown to play a role in neoplastic transformation by inhibiting p53 gene expression (11Kim D.S. Park S.S. Nam B.H. Kim I.H. Kim S.Y. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 10936-10943Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Also, NFκB attenuated p53 protein stability by inducing the E3 ubiquitin ligase MDM2 (12Lin Y. Bai L. Chen W. Xu S. Expert Opin. Ther. Targets. 2010; 14: 45-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the NFκB gene promoter is activated by p53 mutants, and p52 subunit of NFκB can modulate the promoter activity of p53 target genes (13Aylon Y. Oren M. Cell. 2007; 130: 597-600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Moreover, NFκB and p53 compete for coactivators, for example, the histone acetyltransferases p300 and CBP (14Schneider G. Henrich A. Greiner G. Wolf V. Lovas A. Wieczorek M. Wagner T. Reichardt S. von Werder A. Schmid R.M. Weih F. Heinzel T. Saur D. Krämer O.H. Oncogene. 2010; 29: 2795-2806Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Interestingly this cross-talk is often biased toward NFκB proteins in drug-resistant tumors (15Bourguignon L.Y. Xia W. Wong G. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 2657-2671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). An ideal therapeutic approach should, therefore, involve tailoring this cross-talk in favor of p53 to chemo-sensitize drug-resistant tumors. While talking about the competition between NFκB and p53 for “the survival of the fittest,” the possibility of SMAR1 in regulating the signaling cross-talk between NFκB and p53 cannot be ignored. SMAR1, a scaffold matrix-associated region-binding protein, is involved in chromatin-mediated gene regulation. Studies suggest that SMAR1, via p53, is involved in delaying tumor progression in vivo (16Kaul R. Mukherjee S. Ahmed F. Bhat M.K. Chhipa R. Galande S. Chattopadhyay S. Int. J. Cancer. 2003; 103: 606-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). SMAR1 stabilizes p53 by not allowing Mdm2 to bind and export p53 out of the nucleus for proteasome degradation (16Kaul R. Mukherjee S. Ahmed F. Bhat M.K. Chhipa R. Galande S. Chattopadhyay S. Int. J. Cancer. 2003; 103: 606-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). On the other hand, although SMAR1 facilitates nuclear translocation of anti-apoptotic transcription factor, p65NFκB, it inhibits NFκB-dependent transcription of a specific set of NFκB target genes by recruitment of a repressor complex like histone deacetylase (17Singh K. Sinha S. Malonia S.K. Bist P. Tergaonkar V. Chattopadhyay S. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 1267-1278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Interestingly, SMAR1 is also known to repress p53 target proteins Bax, PUMA, and Noxa while preventing apoptosis (18Sinha S. Malonia S.K. Mittal S.P. Singh K. Kadreppa S. Kamat R. Mukhopadhyaya R. Pal J.K. Chattopadhyay S. EMBO J. 2010; 29: 830-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Considering such diverse roles of SMAR1 in both inducing and inhibiting apoptosis, an ideal therapeutic approach should, therefore, involve tailoring SMAR1-signaling network against NFκB but essentially in favor of p53 to chemo-sensitize drug-resistant tumors. Apart from drug resistance, tissue toxicity and immune dysfunctions as induced by doxorubicin most often amplify the problem. The major side effects include immune suppression, hepatotoxicity, neuropathy, alopecia, etc. (19Tao Z. Jones E. Goodisman J. Souid A.K. Anal.

Tumori. 2010; 96: 271-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Doxorubicin also causes cardiac toxicity at high dose, and cardiomyopathy may even lead to irreversible congestive heart failure (19Tao Z. Jones E. Goodisman J. Souid A.K. Anal. Biochem. 2008; 381: 43-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 20Patel N. Joseph C. Corcoran G.B. Ray S.D. Toxicol. Appl.

Tumori. 2010; 96: 271-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). A combinatorial therapy that not only shifts the cancer cells from resistance to apoptosis but also prevents systemic toxicity in the cancer patient will, therefore, be the ideal candidate for regressing drug-resistant cancers. It has been well established that curcumin inhibits NFκB activation and expression of its target genes as induced by diverse agents and anticancer drugs (23Kunnumakkara A.B. Anand P. Aggarwal B.B. Cancer Lett. 2008; 269: 199-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (915) Google Scholar, 24Singh S. Aggarwal B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24995-25000Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1280) Google Scholar). Recently, Sreekanth and co-workers (25Bava S.V. Sreekanth C.N. Thulasidasan A.K. Anto N.P. Cheriyan V.T. Puliyappadamba V.T. Menon S.G. Ravichandran S.D. Anto R.J. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2011; 43: 331-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) have shown that curcumin could effectively down-regulate survival signals induced by paclitaxel, thereby sensitizing cancer cells toward that drug. According to Choi et al. (26Choi B.H. Kim C.G. Lim Y. Shin S.Y. Lee Y.H. Cancer Lett. 2008; 259: 111-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar) curcumin down-regulated the multidrug resistance mdr1b gene expression in multidrug-resistant L1210/Adr cells probably due to the suppression of P-glycoprotein expression inhibiting the PI3K/Akt/NFκB pathway. On the other hand, reports from our laboratory have established the involvement of p53 in curcumin-induced cancer cell death (27Choudhuri T. Pal S. Das T. Sa G. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 20059-20068Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar, 28Choudhuri T. Pal S. Agwarwal M.L. Das T. Sa G. FEBS Lett. 2002; 512: 334-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar, 29Pal S. Choudhuri T. Chattopadhyay S. Bhattacharya A. Datta G.K. Das T. Sa G. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Chem. 2010; 285: 33104-33112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). On the basis of all these reports we hypothesized that by shifting of cellular microenvironment, curcumin may down-regulate the NFκB survival pathway and promote p53 apoptotic signal thereby sensitizing the drug resistance breast cancer cells to doxorubicin. Because curcumin also ameliorates immunosuppression and inhibits systemic toxicity in the tumor bearer (31Bhattacharyya S. Md, Sakib Hossain D. Mohanty S. Sankar Sen G. Chattopadhyay S. Banerjee S. Chakraborty J. Das K. Sarkar D. Das T. Sa G. Cell. Mol. Immunol. 2010; 7: 306-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 32Bhattacharyya S. Mandal D. Saha B. Sen G.S. Das T. Sa G. J. Biol.

Prev. 2005; 29: 470-478Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), combinatorial application of this plant product with doxorubicin may also prevent systemic toxicity in the tumor bearer besides shifting the cancer cells from resistance to apoptosis. To prove our hypothesis we utilized two experimental systems, (i) an in vitro mammary epithelial carcinoma cell model in which the molecular mechanisms can be verified and (ii) an in vivo mammary carcinoma-bearing mouse model that better reflects the molecular complexity of patient-derived tumor specimens. Here we report that curcumin sensitizes drug-resistant breast tumors to doxorubicin by inhibiting the NFκB-mediated defense pathway and activating p53 apoptotic signaling. Inhibition of p65NFκB by curcumin was both SMAR1-dependent and -independent. In fact, inactivation of the NFκB pathway by curcumin rescued p300 from p65NFκB and launched p53-p300 collaboration to induce p53-dependent Bax, PUMA, and Noxa transactivation and instigation of downstream mitochondria-dependent death cascade in drug-resistant breast cancer cells. Interestingly for induction of p53-dependent apoptosis, curcumin-mediated execution of PML-SMAR1 cross-talk was indispensable. A simultaneous decrease in drug-induced systemic toxicity might also have enhanced the efficacy of doxorubicin by improving the intrinsic defense machineries of the tumor bearer. Therefore, curcumin in combination with standard chemotherapeutics may serve as a double-edged sword in culminating both resistance and toxicity after chemotherapy. Swiss albino mice (NCLAS, Hyderabad, India) weighing 23–25 g were maintained in a temperature-controlled room with a light dark cycle. To determine the combinatorial therapeutic efficacy of curcumin and doxorubicin, 1 × 106 doxorubicin-resistant Ehrlich ascites carcinoma (EAC) cells (obtained from Choudhuri and Chatterjee (35Choudhuri S.K. Chatterjee A. Anticancer Drugs. 1998; 9: 825-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar)) were peritoneally injected in mice, and cancer cells were allowed to grow to 7 days. Then the mice were divided in to 7 groups (10 mice in each group) and treated as follows: 1) vehicle control, 2) LD50 doxorubicin (5 mg/kg body weight), 3) LD50 curcumin (50 mg/kg body weight), 4) ½LD50 doxorubicin (2.5 mg/kg body weight), 5) ½LD50 curcumin (25 mg/kg body weight), 6) LD50 doxorubicin + LD50 curcumin, and 7) ½LD50 doxorubicin + ½LD50 curcumin. A single dose of doxorubicin was given intraperitoneally on the seventh day, and starting from that day curcumin was fed orally every alternate day (up to 21 days). Then, after sacrificing the mice, cell count and cell cycle experiments were carried out. Initially, for the estimation of the LD50 dose of doxorubicin and curcumin, mice bearing sensitive tumors were treated with different doses of doxorubicin and curcumin, and the dose at which tumor burden was reduced to half that of untreated animals was considered to be the respective LD50 dose that in the present case was 5 mg/kg body weight and 50 mg/kg body weight for doxorubicin and curcumin respectively (supplemental Table 1). All animal experiments were performed following the principles of laboratory animal care (NIH publication No. 85-23, revised in 1985) as well as Indian laws on protection of animals under the prevision of authorized investigator. EAC cells were collected from the peritoneal cavity of tumor-bearing mice and freed from adherent cells. More than 98% of the non-adherent population was found to be CD16-negative, among which >92% were characterized by Wright staining (34Pal S. Bhattacharyya S. Choudhuri T. Datta G.K. Das T. Sa G.

The cells were routinely maintained in complete DMEM or RPMI 1640 at 37 °C in a humidified incubator containing 5% CO2 (36Lahiry L. Saha B. Chakraborty J. Adhikary A. Mohanty S. Hossain D.M.

Viable cell numbers were determined by a trypan blue exclusion test. Cells were treated with specified doses of doxorubicin and curcumin for definite time intervals. During chemosensitization with curcumin in vitro, cells were pretreated for 2 h with curcumin followed by doxorubicin treatment for 24 h. To inhibit mitochondrial pore formation, cells were treated with cyclosporine A 25 μm before 1 h of drug treatment. While determining the toxicity of doxorubicin, curcumin or the combinatorial doses, thymus, spleen, and femurs from drug-treated tumor-bearing animals were removed after 21 days of tumor inoculation, and a single cell suspension of thymocytes, lymphocytes, and bone marrow progenitor cells was made and suspended in RPMI 1640 medium (Sigma). Splenic lymphocytes were purified by Ficoll gradient (Sigma) centrifugation. Macrophages were allowed to adhere at 37 °C for 1 h. Viable cells were counted by a trypan blue dye exclusion test (31Bhattacharyya S. Md, Sakib Hossain D. Mohanty S. Sankar Sen G. Chattopadhyay S. Banerjee S. Chakraborty J. Das K. Sarkar D. Das T.

The mRNA and protein levels were determined by RT-PCR and Western blotting. For the determination of apoptosis, control and treated cells were stained with 7AAD and annexin V-PE (BD Pharmingen) and analyzed on flow cytometer (FACSCalibur, BD Biosciences). Electronic compensation of the instrument was done to exclude overlapping of the emission spectra. A total of 10,000 events were acquired for analysis using CellQuest software (BD Biosciences). annexin V/7AAD-positive cells were regarded as apoptotic cells (37Chattopadhyay S. Bhattacharyya S.

Cell cycle phase distribution of nuclear DNA was determined using a fluorescence detector equipped with 488-nm argon laser light source and 623-nm band pass filter (linear scale) and CellQuest software. Ten thousand total events were acquired, and a histogram display of DNA content (x axis, propidium iodide fluorescence) versus counts (y axis) has been displayed. CellQuest software was employed to quantitate the data at different phases of the cell cycle. For determination of mitochondrial transmembrane potential, control and treated cells were harvested, washed twice with PBS, and incubated with 40 nm 3,3′-dihexyloxacarbocyanine iodide (DiOC6) in serum-free RPMI 1640 and incubated for 15 min at 37 °C in dark. The cells were analyzed flow cytometrically for 3,3′-dihexyloxacarbocyanine iodide fluorescence. Cells were lysed in buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, and 0.5 mm DTT) and spun at 3300 × g to get cell lysates. The pellet was resuspended in buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 0.4 m NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, and 0.5 mm DTT) and spun down at 12,000 × g for 30 min to get nuclear fraction. For whole cell lysates, cells were resuspended and homogenized in buffer (100 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 300 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, and 0.25% sodium deoxycholate). All the buffers were supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitor mixtures (39Lahiry L. Saha B. Chakraborty J. Bhattacharyya S. Chattopadhyay S. Banerjee S. Choudhuri T. Mandal D.

Equal protein loading was confirmed with α-actin/histone-H1/manganese superoxide dismutase antibody (Santa Cruz). For the determination of direct interaction between two proteins, a co-immunoprecipitation technique was employed (36Lahiry L. Saha B. Chakraborty J. Adhikary A. Mohanty S. Hossain D.M. Banerjee S.

Samples (300 μg of protein from the total lysate) were incubated at 4 °C overnight with anti-p53/-p65/-PML/-IgG antibody and then incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with protein A-Sepharose. Immunocomplexes were washed of unbound proteins with cold TBS with protease inhibitors, and pelleted beads were boiled for 5 min in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. The immunoprecipitated proteins were resolved on SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blotting for detection of associated proteins. Equal protein loading was confirmed using α-actin as an internal control. Serum glutamate pyruvate transaminase, glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase, and alkaline phosphatase were estimated according to standard protocol. Two μg of the total RNA each from doxorubicin/curcumin-treated doxorubicin-sensitive/-resistant cells was extracted by TRIzol (Invitrogen) and reverse-transcribed and then subjected to PCR with enzymes and reagents of the RTplusPCR system (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany) using GeneAmpPCR 2720 (Applied Biosystems Foster City, CA) (39Lahiry L.

https://openalex.org/W2157844822,"The Pseudomonas syringae type III effector HopU1 is a mono-ADP-ribosyltransferase that is injected into plant cells by the type III protein secretion system. Inside the plant cell it suppresses immunity by modifying RNA-binding proteins including the glycine-rich RNA-binding protein GRP7. The crystal structure of HopU1 at 2.7-Å resolution reveals two unique protruding loops, L1 and L4, not found in other mono-ADP-ribosyltransferases. Site-directed mutagenesis demonstrates that these loops are essential for substrate recognition and enzymatic activity. HopU1 ADP-ribosylates the conserved arginine 49 of GRP7, and this reduces the ability of GRP7 to bind RNA in vitro. In vivo, expression of GRP7 with Arg-49 replaced with lysine does not complement the reduced immune responses of the Arabidopsis thaliana grp7-1 mutant demonstrating the importance of this residue for GRP7 function. These data provide mechanistic details how HopU1 recognizes this novel type of substrate and highlights the role of GRP7 in plant immunity."

IntroductionMitochondrial supercomplexes are associations of different respiratory protein complexes (1Schäfer E. Dencher N.A. Vonck J. Parcej D.N. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 12579-12585Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 2Eubel H. Heinemeyer J. Sunderhaus S. Braun H.P. Plant Physiol. Biochem. 2004; 42: 937-942Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). In plants, the proton-translocating complexes I 2The abbreviations used are: IIII, IV, respiratory complexes I, III, and IV respectivelyBNblue nativeDNP2,4-dinitrophenolTPP+tetraphenyl phosphoniummtETCmitochondrial electron transport chain. (NADH-dehydrogenase), III (cytochrome c reductase), and IV (cytochrome c oxidase) have been documented to be organized in supercomplexes with various configurations and stoichiometries. Supercomplexes can be composed of different combinations of only two complexes, like the supercomplex I+III2, I2+III2, III2+IV, and III2+IV2, or various combinations of the three complexes I, III, and IV in so-called respirasomes. Moreover, it was suggested that these supercomplexes may be organized in even larger linear structures, so-called megacomplexes or respiratory strings (3Bultema J.B. Braun H.P. Boekema E.J. Kouril R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2009; 1787: 60-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). However, it should be noted that apart from the conglomeration of respiratory complexes into supercomplexes, a considerable population of the complexes I and IV present in the inner mitochondrial membrane occur as individual complexes (4Eubel H. Heinemeyer J. Braun H.P. Plant Physiol. 2004; 134: 1450-1459Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar).Since their first discovery in animals (5Schägger H. Pfeiffer K. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1777-1783Crossref PubMed Scopus (1011) Google Scholar), fungi (6Krause F. Scheckhuber C.Q. Werner A. Rexroth S. Reifschneider N.H. Dencher N.A. Osiewacz H.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 26453-26461Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), and plants (4Eubel H. Heinemeyer J. Braun H.P. Plant Physiol. 2004; 134: 1450-1459Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), the function of supercomplexes for respiratory electron transport has been discussed, but no conclusive explanation is formulated. Several roles of mitochondrial supercomplexes have been discussed in the literature. First, supercomplexes would increase the stability of individual complexes (7Acín-Pérez R. Fernández-Silva P. Peleato M.L. Pérez-Martos A. Enriquez J.A. Mol. Cell. 2008; 32: 529-539Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar, 8Diaz F. Fukui H. Garcia S. Moraes C.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 4872-4881Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Second, supercomplexes would affect the membrane structure and increase the dense packing of proteins within the membranes (9Boekema E.J. Braun H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 1-4Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Third, electrons could be efficiently channeled between the reactive sites of the complexes within supercomplexes (10Schägger H. IUBMB Life. 2001; 52: 119-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). This electron channeling model is supported by the three-dimensional structure analysis of plant (11Dudkina N.V. Eubel H. Keegstra W. Boekema E.J. Braun H.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 3225-3229Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar), yeast (12Heinemeyer J. Braun H.P. Boekema E.J. Kouril R. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 12240-12248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), and animal (1Schäfer E. Dencher N.A. Vonck J. Parcej D.N. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 12579-12585Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) supercomplexes, which revealed that the binding sites for the electron carriers ubiquinone and cytochrome c within the complexes I and III or III and IV are in relative proximity to each other. Finally, in plants the organization of respiratory complexes into supercomplexes could affect the direction of the electron flow from and toward the various alternative components of the mitochondrial electron transport chain, such as the type II dehydrogenases (alternative NAD(P)H dehydrogenase (ND2)) or the alternative oxidase (AOX) (2Eubel H. Heinemeyer J. Sunderhaus S. Braun H.P. Plant Physiol. Biochem. 2004; 42: 937-942Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). This could play a role in the fine-tuning of energy metabolism and ATP yield when environmental conditions change (13Gupta K.J. Zabalza A. van Dongen J.T. Physiol. Plant. 2009; 137: 383-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar).The latter putative functions of respiratory supercomplexes imply a dynamic recombination of complexes within the supercomplexes rather than that supercomplexes exist as static structures. As a consequence, it would mean that the distribution and activity of specific complexes among the various supercomplexes can vary upon specific environmental conditions (14Chien L.F. Wu Y.C. Chen H.P. Plant Physiol. Biochem. 2011; 49: 449-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The aim of this study was to analyze the variation in activity of specific complexes within the various supercomplexes of the mitochondrial electron transport chain when the oxygen availability changes. We used blue native PAGE and determined changes in the activity of complex I and complex IV within the respective supercomplexes and related these findings to the activity of oxygen consumption and changes of the mitochondrial membrane potential. From our studies it is concluded that supercomplex formation is a dynamic process and that supercomplex composition can be readily and reversibly modified.DISCUSSIONThe respiratory complexes I, III, and IV of the mETC associate into supercomplexes with various individual stoichiometric compositions (9Boekema E.J. Braun H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 1-4Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar), but a functional role of these supercomplexes for respiration is still being discussed. Studies investigating the supercomplex composition or stability using specific respiratory inhibitors (supplemental Fig. S13 and S14) did not provide evidence for any differential regulation of supercomplexes. However, further results presented here reveal a role of the supercomplexes during hypoxia in the differential regulation of electron supply via alternative components of the respiratory pathway.For studying supercomplex stability in plants, we investigated the occurrence of the various supercomplexes in the tobacco CMSII mutant, in which complex I is completely absent. Several studies revealed before that CMSII has no detectable complex I activity (35Gutierres S. Sabar M. Lelandais C. Chetrit P. Diolez P. Degand H. Boutry M. Vedel F. de Kouchkovsky Y. De Paepe R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1997; 94: 3436-3441Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 36Sabar M. De Paepe R. de Kouchkovsky Y. Plant Physiol. 2000; 124: 1239-1250Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar) and that no supercomplexes exist anymore that contain complex I (29Pineau B. Mathieu C. Gérard-Hirne C. De Paepe R. Chétrit P. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 25994-26001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Here, we show that supercomplexes III2+IV2 and III2+IV remained present and that complex IV activity in these supercomplexes even increased in the CMSII line (Fig. 1). Similarly, increased abundance of supercomplexes III2+IV2 and III2+IV was observed when complex I dissociated from the respirasomes during hypoxic conditions (Fig. 2, supplemental Figs. S5 and S6) or when succinate was supplied at low pH (Fig. 3, supplemental Fig. S8). It should be noted that isolated mitochondria that were supplied with succinate at pH 5.5 lost their membrane potential (Fig. 6D). However, membrane depolarization could not explain the dissociation of the supercomplexes as the addition of DNP or disrupting the membrane with a freeze-thaw cycle did not change the supercomplex activity under neutral pH conditions (Fig. 5, C and D).Apparently, complex I can dissociate from a supercomplex, whereas the complexes III and IV are kept together in a smaller supercomplex. In humans it was shown that supercomplexes are essential for the stability of complex I. Cell lines from patients that are deficient in complex III do not form supercomplexes, and as a secondary effect, also complex I disintegrated (37Schägger H. de Coo R. Bauer M.F. Hofmann S. Godinot C. Brandt U. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 36349-36353Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Also, proper assembly of complex IV appeared to be essential for the stability of complex I in both human and mice mitochondria (38Li Y. D'Aurelio M. Deng J.H. Park J.S. Manfredi G. Hu P. Lu J. Bai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 17557-17562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 39Maas M.F. Krause F. Dencher N.A. Sainsard-Chanet A. J. Mol. Biol. 2009; 387: 259-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In contrast to animals, complex I stability was not affected in the Cyc1–1 mutant of the fungus Podospora anserina, which is lacking complex III and, therefore, depends on alternative oxidase to keep the electron flow in the mitochondrial electron transport chain upright (39Maas M.F. Krause F. Dencher N.A. Sainsard-Chanet A. J. Mol. Biol. 2009; 387: 259-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Probably, the differences in respirasome stability between mammals, plants, and fungi relate to the presence of alternative components in the mETC, like alternative oxidase or the type-2 dehydrogenases in the latter organisms.It is most striking that the change of the supercomplex composition as induced by hypoxia (Fig. 2, supplementary Figs. S5 and S6) resembles the changes induced by decreasing the pH in the presence of succinate as respiratory substrate (Fig. 3, supplementary Fig. S8). Therefore, we suggest that in both cases complex I dissociates from the large supercomplexes, whereas supercomplex III2+IV accumulates. However, also alternative post-translational modifications or allosteric regulation of complex I activity cannot be ruled out at this stage to explain the changes in complex activity within the supercomplexes that we observed during hypoxia. During reoxygenation the supercomplexes reassemble (Fig. 2), indicating that the dissociation of supercomplexes indeed relates to the oxygen availability. It is well described that the respiratory activity of plant tissue changes with the oxygen availability of the cells; at decreasing oxygen availability the respiratory activity declines (13Gupta K.J. Zabalza A. van Dongen J.T. Physiol. Plant. 2009; 137: 383-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 40Geigenberger P. Curr. Opin.

Plant Physiol. 2011; 168: 1434-1443Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Hypoxia is also known to induce a decrease of the cellular pH in plants as well as in other organisms (42Felle H.H. Plant Biol. 2001; 3: 577-591Crossref Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Consistent with that, the pH at the cutting surface of potato tubers was determined to drop significantly in flooded tubers as compared with normoxic tubers, and these pH values reverted again during recovery in air after the flooding treatment (supplemental Fig. S7). Of course, these pH determinations cannot be attributed directly to any cellular compartment but, rather, combine changes in both apoplast and intracellular compartments. Nevertheless, these data confirm that our flooding treatment of the tubers resulted in the typical cellular acidification as induced by hypoxia in plants (40Geigenberger P. Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 2003; 6: 247-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). The pH of the mitochondrial matrix is generally assumed to be slightly more basic than the cytosol but is documented to follow fluctuations of the cytosolic pH (42Felle H.H.

Experiments using pH-sensitive fluorescent probes that were specifically targeted toward the mitochondria of HeLa cells revealed a marked decrease in the pH of the matrix after providing the cells with organic acids like lactate, pyruvate, or acetate (44Llopis J.

As the cytosolic acidification of a hypoxic cell is caused by a combination of low ATP (43Felle H.H. Ann. Bot. 2005; 96: 519-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) and accumulation of organic acids like lactate and succinate (32van Dongen J.T. Fröhlich A. Ramírez-Aguilar S.J. Schauer N. Fernie A.R. Erban A. Kopka J. Clark J. Langer A. Geigenberger P. Ann. Bot. 2009; 103: 269-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar), it must be assumed that the pH in the mitochondrial matrix of the hypoxic potato tubers that were used in our experiments decreased as well. This suggests that the dissociation of complex I from complexes III and IV that is observed during hypoxia and after decreasing the pH results from the changing pH in both cases.For mammalian mitochondria, a role of respiratory supercomplexes was suggested in determining respiratory efficiency (47Rosca M.G. Vazquez E.J. Kerner J. Parland W. Chandler M.P. Stanley W. Sabbah H.N. Hoppel C.L. Cardiovasc. Res. 2008; 80: 30-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). After induced ischemic heart failure in dogs, dissociation of the large supercomplexes containing complex I, III, and IV and a concomitant decrease of respiratory activity of intact heart mitochondria was observed even though the capacity of the individual respiratory complexes was not affected by the treatment. In plants, the consequence of the separation between complex I and the combination of complexes III and IV for the flow of electrons through the mETC would be a shift toward supercomplex III2+IV cooperating with the alternative NADH dehydrogenases rather than with complex I. Consistently, the alternative NADH dehydrogenases are activated by lowered pH, whereas complex I is inhibited by a low pH (48Geisler D.A. Broselid C. Hederstedt L. Rasmusson A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 28455-28464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 49Rasmusson A.G. Geisler D.A. Møller I.M.

Moreover, complex I was also shown to be reversibly deactivated during hypoxia of mammalian mitochondria in a reactive nitrogen species-dependent manner (51Galkin A. Abramov A.Y. Frakich N. Duchen M.R. Moncada S. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 36055-36061Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). In plants, the dissociation of complex I from the large supercomplexes as observed here during hypoxia is suggested to favor the electron transmission from the alternative type 2 NAD(P)H dehydrogenases and succinate dehydrogenase to ubiquinone. This could help in oxidizing the pool of cytosolic NADH during hypoxia, which is required to prevent inhibition of glycolysis due NAD+ limitation (39Maas M.F. Krause F. Dencher N.A. Sainsard-Chanet A. J. Mol. Biol. 2009; 387: 259-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar).Summarizing, our results suggest that respiratory supercomplexes could be involved in directing the flow of electrons between different respiratory electron transport pathways of the plant mETC (Fig. 7). Dissociation of complex I from complexes III and IV occurs under hypoxic conditions, during which succinate accumulates as substrate of complex II, and alternative NAD(P)H dehydrogenases are favored above complex I as electron donors to ubiquinone due to cellular acidification. This response of the supercomplex composition could probably act as a regulatory mechanism involved in acclimation of respiration to stress conditions in which the cellular pH changes, such as hypoxia and anoxia.

(NADH-dehydrogenase), III (cytochrome c reductase), and IV (cytochrome c oxidase) have been documented to be organized in supercomplexes with various configurations and stoichiometries. Supercomplexes can be composed of different combinations of only two complexes, like the supercomplex I+III2, I2+III2, III2+IV, and III2+IV2, or various combinations of the three complexes I, III, and IV in so-called respirasomes. Moreover, it was suggested that these supercomplexes may be organized in even larger linear structures, so-called megacomplexes or respiratory strings (3Bultema J.B. Braun H.P. Boekema E.J. Kouril R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2009; 1787: 60-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). However, it should be noted that apart from the conglomeration of respiratory complexes into supercomplexes, a considerable population of the complexes I and IV present in the inner mitochondrial membrane occur as individual complexes (4Eubel H. Heinemeyer J. Braun H.P. Plant Physiol. 2004; 134: 1450-1459Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar).Since their first discovery in animals (5Schägger H. Pfeiffer K. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1777-1783Crossref PubMed Scopus (1011) Google Scholar), fungi (6Krause F. Scheckhuber C.Q. Werner A. Rexroth S. Reifschneider N.H. Dencher N.A. Osiewacz H.D. J. Biol.

Plant Physiol. 2004; 134: 1450-1459Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), the function of supercomplexes for respiratory electron transport has been discussed, but no conclusive explanation is formulated. Several roles of mitochondrial supercomplexes have been discussed in the literature. First, supercomplexes would increase the stability of individual complexes (7Acín-Pérez R. Fernández-Silva P.

Chem. 2007; 282: 1-4Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Third, electrons could be efficiently channeled between the reactive sites of the complexes within supercomplexes (10Schägger H. IUBMB Life. 2001; 52: 119-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). This electron channeling model is supported by the three-dimensional structure analysis of plant (11Dudkina N.V. Eubel H.

Finally, in plants the organization of respiratory complexes into supercomplexes could affect the direction of the electron flow from and toward the various alternative components of the mitochondrial electron transport chain, such as the type II dehydrogenases (alternative NAD(P)H dehydrogenase (ND2)) or the alternative oxidase (AOX) (2Eubel H. Heinemeyer J. Sunderhaus S. Braun H.P. Plant Physiol. Biochem. 2004; 42: 937-942Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). This could play a role in the fine-tuning of energy metabolism and ATP yield when environmental conditions change (13Gupta K.J. Zabalza A. van Dongen J.T. Physiol. Plant. 2009; 137: 383-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar).The latter putative functions of respiratory supercomplexes imply a dynamic recombination of complexes within the supercomplexes rather than that supercomplexes exist as static structures. As a consequence, it would mean that the distribution and activity of specific complexes among the various supercomplexes can vary upon specific environmental conditions (14Chien L.F. Wu Y.C. Chen H.P. Plant Physiol. Biochem. 2011; 49: 449-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The aim of this study was to analyze the variation in activity of specific complexes within the various supercomplexes of the mitochondrial electron transport chain when the oxygen availability changes. We used blue native PAGE and determined changes in the activity of complex I and complex IV within the respective supercomplexes and related these findings to the activity of oxygen consumption and changes of the mitochondrial membrane potential. From our studies it is concluded that supercomplex formation is a dynamic process and that supercomplex composition can be readily and reversibly modified. Mitochondrial supercomplexes are associations of different respiratory protein complexes (1Schäfer E. Dencher N.A. Vonck J. Parcej D.N.

From our studies it is concluded that supercomplex formation is a dynamic process and that supercomplex composition can be readily and reversibly modified. DISCUSSIONThe respiratory complexes I, III, and IV of the mETC associate into supercomplexes with various individual stoichiometric compositions (9Boekema E.J. Braun H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 1-4Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar), but a functional role of these supercomplexes for respiration is still being discussed. Studies investigating the supercomplex composition or stability using specific respiratory inhibitors (supplemental Fig. S13 and S14) did not provide evidence for any differential regulation of supercomplexes. However, further results presented here reveal a role of the supercomplexes during hypoxia in the differential regulation of electron supply via alternative components of the respiratory pathway.For studying supercomplex stability in plants, we investigated the occurrence of the various supercomplexes in the tobacco CMSII mutant, in which complex I is completely absent. Several studies revealed before that CMSII has no detectable complex I activity (35Gutierres S. Sabar M. Lelandais C. Chetrit P. Diolez P. Degand H. Boutry M. Vedel F. de Kouchkovsky Y. De Paepe R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1997; 94: 3436-3441Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 36Sabar M. De Paepe R. de Kouchkovsky Y. Plant Physiol. 2000; 124: 1239-1250Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar) and that no supercomplexes exist anymore that contain complex I (29Pineau B. Mathieu C. Gérard-Hirne C. De Paepe R. Chétrit P. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 25994-26001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Here, we show that supercomplexes III2+IV2 and III2+IV remained present and that complex IV activity in these supercomplexes even increased in the CMSII line (Fig. 1). Similarly, increased abundance of supercomplexes III2+IV2 and III2+IV was observed when complex I dissociated from the respirasomes during hypoxic conditions (Fig. 2, supplemental Figs. S5 and S6) or when succinate was supplied at low pH (Fig. 3, supplemental Fig. S8). It should be noted that isolated mitochondria that were supplied with succinate at pH 5.5 lost their membrane potential (Fig. 6D). However, membrane depolarization could not explain the dissociation of the supercomplexes as the addition of DNP or disrupting the membrane with a freeze-thaw cycle did not change the supercomplex activity under neutral pH conditions (Fig. 5, C and D).Apparently, complex I can dissociate from a supercomplex, whereas the complexes III and IV are kept together in a smaller supercomplex. In humans it was shown that supercomplexes are essential for the stability of complex I. Cell lines from patients that are deficient in complex III do not form supercomplexes, and as a secondary effect, also complex I disintegrated (37Schägger H. de Coo R. Bauer M.F. Hofmann S. Godinot C. Brandt U. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 36349-36353Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Also, proper assembly of complex IV appeared to be essential for the stability of complex I in both human and mice mitochondria (38Li Y. D'Aurelio M. Deng J.H. Park J.S. Manfredi G. Hu P. Lu J. Bai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 17557-17562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 39Maas M.F. Krause F. Dencher N.A. Sainsard-Chanet A. J. Mol. Biol. 2009; 387: 259-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In contrast to animals, complex I stability was not affected in the Cyc1–1 mutant of the fungus Podospora anserina, which is lacking complex III and, therefore, depends on alternative oxidase to keep the electron flow in the mitochondrial electron transport chain upright (39Maas M.F. Krause F. Dencher N.A. Sainsard-Chanet A. J. Mol. Biol. 2009; 387: 259-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Probably, the differences in respirasome stability between mammals, plants, and fungi relate to the presence of alternative components in the mETC, like alternative oxidase or the type-2 dehydrogenases in the latter organisms.It is most striking that the change of the supercomplex composition as induced by hypoxia (Fig. 2, supplementary Figs. S5 and S6) resembles the changes induced by decreasing the pH in the presence of succinate as respiratory substrate (Fig. 3, supplementary Fig. S8). Therefore, we suggest that in both cases complex I dissociates from the large supercomplexes, whereas supercomplex III2+IV accumulates. However, also alternative post-translational modifications or allosteric regulation of complex I activity cannot be ruled out at this stage to explain the changes in complex activity within the supercomplexes that we observed during hypoxia. During reoxygenation the supercomplexes reassemble (Fig. 2), indicating that the dissociation of supercomplexes indeed relates to the oxygen availability. It is well described that the respiratory activity of plant tissue changes with the oxygen availability of the cells; at decreasing oxygen availability the respiratory activity declines (13Gupta K.J. Zabalza A. van Dongen J.T. Physiol. Plant. 2009; 137: 383-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 40Geigenberger P. Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 2003; 6: 247-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar, 41van Dongen J.T. Gupta K.J. Ramírez-Aguilar S.J. Araújo W.L. Nunes-Nesi A. Fernie A.R. J. Plant Physiol. 2011; 168: 1434-1443Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Hypoxia is also known to induce a decrease of the cellular pH in plants as well as in other organisms (42Felle H.H. Plant Biol. 2001; 3: 577-591Crossref Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Consistent with that, the pH at the cutting surface of potato tubers was determined to drop significantly in flooded tubers as compared with normoxic tubers, and these pH values reverted again during recovery in air after the flooding treatment (supplemental Fig. S7). Of course, these pH determinations cannot be attributed directly to any cellular compartment but, rather, combine changes in both apoplast and intracellular compartments. Nevertheless, these data confirm that our flooding treatment of the tubers resulted in the typical cellular acidification as induced by hypoxia in plants (40Geigenberger P. Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 2003; 6: 247-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). The pH of the mitochondrial matrix is generally assumed to be slightly more basic than the cytosol but is documented to follow fluctuations of the cytosolic pH (42Felle H.H. Plant Biol. 2001; 3: 577-591Crossref Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 43Felle H.H. Ann. Bot. 2005; 96: 519-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 44Llopis J. McCaffery J.M. Miyawaki A.

Microbiology. 2009; 155: 268-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Experiments using pH-sensitive fluorescent probes that were specifically targeted toward the mitochondria of HeLa cells revealed a marked decrease in the pH of the matrix after providing the cells with organic acids like lactate, pyruvate, or acetate (44Llopis J.

Filippin L. Pozzan T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 11521-11529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). As the cytosolic acidification of a hypoxic cell is caused by a combination of low ATP (43Felle H.H. Ann. Bot. 2005; 96: 519-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) and accumulation of organic acids like lactate and succinate (32van Dongen J.T. Fröhlich A. Ramírez-Aguilar S.J. Schauer N. Fernie A.R. Erban A. Kopka J. Clark J. Langer A. Geigenberger P. Ann. Bot. 2009; 103: 269-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar), it must be assumed that the pH in the mitochondrial matrix of the hypoxic potato tubers that were used in our experiments decreased as well. This suggests that the dissociation of complex I from complexes III and IV that is observed during hypoxia and after decreasing the pH results from the changing pH in both cases.For mammalian mitochondria, a role of respiratory supercomplexes was suggested in determining respiratory efficiency (47Rosca M.G.

After induced ischemic heart failure in dogs, dissociation of the large supercomplexes containing complex I, III, and IV and a concomitant decrease of respiratory activity of intact heart mitochondria was observed even though the capacity of the individual respiratory complexes was not affected by the treatment. In plants, the consequence of the separation between complex I and the combination of complexes III and IV for the flow of electrons through the mETC would be a shift toward supercomplex III2+IV cooperating with the alternative NADH dehydrogenases rather than with complex I. Consistently, the alternative NADH dehydrogenases are activated by lowered pH, whereas complex I is inhibited by a low pH (48Geisler D.A. Broselid C. Hederstedt L. Rasmusson A.G. J. Biol.

Moreover, complex I was also shown to be reversibly deactivated during hypoxia of mammalian mitochondria in a reactive nitrogen species-dependent manner (51Galkin A. Abramov A.Y. Frakich N. Duchen M.R. Moncada S. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 36055-36061Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). In plants, the dissociation of complex I from the large supercomplexes as observed here during hypoxia is suggested to favor the electron transmission from the alternative type 2 NAD(P)H dehydrogenases and succinate dehydrogenase to ubiquinone. This could help in oxidizing the pool of cytosolic NADH during hypoxia, which is required to prevent inhibition of glycolysis due NAD+ limitation (39Maas M.F. Krause F. Dencher N.A. Sainsard-Chanet A. J. Mol. Biol. 2009; 387: 259-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar).Summarizing, our results suggest that respiratory supercomplexes could be involved in directing the flow of electrons between different respiratory electron transport pathways of the plant mETC (Fig. 7). Dissociation of complex I from complexes III and IV occurs under hypoxic conditions, during which succinate accumulates as substrate of complex II, and alternative NAD(P)H dehydrogenases are favored above complex I as electron donors to ubiquinone due to cellular acidification. This response of the supercomplex composition could probably act as a regulatory mechanism involved in acclimation of respiration to stress conditions in which the cellular pH changes, such as hypoxia and anoxia. The respiratory complexes I, III, and IV of the mETC associate into supercomplexes with various individual stoichiometric compositions (9Boekema E.J. Braun H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 1-4Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar), but a functional role of these supercomplexes for respiration is still being discussed. Studies investigating the supercomplex composition or stability using specific respiratory inhibitors (supplemental Fig. S13 and S14) did not provide evidence for any differential regulation of supercomplexes. However, further results presented here reveal a role of the supercomplexes during hypoxia in the differential regulation of electron supply via alternative components of the respiratory pathway. For studying supercomplex stability in plants, we investigated the occurrence of the various supercomplexes in the tobacco CMSII mutant, in which complex I is completely absent. Several studies revealed before that CMSII has no detectable complex I activity (35Gutierres S. Sabar M. Lelandais C. Chetrit P. Diolez P. Degand H. Boutry M. Vedel F. de Kouchkovsky Y. De Paepe R.

Plant Physiol. 2000; 124: 1239-1250Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar) and that no supercomplexes exist anymore that contain complex I (29Pineau B. Mathieu C. Gérard-Hirne C. De Paepe R. Chétrit P. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 25994-26001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Here, we show that supercomplexes III2+IV2 and III2+IV remained present and that complex IV activity in these supercomplexes even increased in the CMSII line (Fig. 1). Similarly, increased abundance of supercomplexes III2+IV2 and III2+IV was observed when complex I dissociated from the respirasomes during hypoxic conditions (Fig. 2, supplemental Figs. S5 and S6) or when succinate was supplied at low pH (Fig. 3, supplemental Fig. S8). It should be noted that isolated mitochondria that were supplied with succinate at pH 5.5 lost their membrane potential (Fig. 6D). However, membrane depolarization could not explain the dissociation of the supercomplexes as the addition of DNP or disrupting the membrane with a freeze-thaw cycle did not change the supercomplex activity under neutral pH conditions (Fig. 5, C and D). Apparently, complex I can dissociate from a supercomplex, whereas the complexes III and IV are kept together in a smaller supercomplex. In humans it was shown that supercomplexes are essential for the stability of complex I. Cell lines from patients that are deficient in complex III do not form supercomplexes, and as a secondary effect, also complex I disintegrated (37Schägger H. de Coo R. Bauer M.F. Hofmann S. Godinot C. Brandt U. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 36349-36353Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Also, proper assembly of complex IV appeared to be essential for the stability of complex I in both human and mice mitochondria (38Li Y. D'Aurelio M. Deng J.H. Park J.S. Manfredi G. Hu P. Lu J. Bai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 17557-17562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 39Maas M.F. Krause F. Dencher N.A. Sainsard-Chanet A. J. Mol. Biol. 2009; 387: 259-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In contrast to animals, complex I stability was not affected in the Cyc1–1 mutant of the fungus Podospora anserina, which is lacking complex III and, therefore, depends on alternative oxidase to keep the electron flow in the mitochondrial electron transport chain upright (39Maas M.F. Krause F. Dencher N.A. Sainsard-Chanet A. J. Mol. Biol. 2009; 387: 259-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Probably, the differences in respirasome stability between mammals, plants, and fungi relate to the presence of alternative components in the mETC, like alternative oxidase or the type-2 dehydrogenases in the latter organisms. It is most striking that the change of the supercomplex composition as induced by hypoxia (Fig. 2, supplementary Figs. S5 and S6) resembles the changes induced by decreasing the pH in the presence of succinate as respiratory substrate (Fig. 3, supplementary Fig. S8). Therefore, we suggest that in both cases complex I dissociates from the large supercomplexes, whereas supercomplex III2+IV accumulates. However, also alternative post-translational modifications or allosteric regulation of complex I activity cannot be ruled out at this stage to explain the changes in complex activity within the supercomplexes that we observed during hypoxia. During reoxygenation the supercomplexes reassemble (Fig. 2), indicating that the dissociation of supercomplexes indeed relates to the oxygen availability. It is well described that the respiratory activity of plant tissue changes with the oxygen availability of the cells; at decreasing oxygen availability the respiratory activity declines (13Gupta K.J. Zabalza A. van Dongen J.T. Physiol. Plant. 2009; 137: 383-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 40Geigenberger P. Curr. Opin.

Plant Physiol. 2011; 168: 1434-1443Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Hypoxia is also known to induce a decrease of the cellular pH in plants as well as in other organisms (42Felle H.H. Plant Biol. 2001; 3: 577-591Crossref Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Consistent with that, the pH at the cutting surface of potato tubers was determined to drop significantly in flooded tubers as compared with normoxic tubers, and these pH values reverted again during recovery in air after the flooding treatment (supplemental Fig. S7). Of course, these pH determinations cannot be attributed directly to any cellular compartment but, rather, combine changes in both apoplast and intracellular compartments. Nevertheless, these data confirm that our flooding treatment of the tubers resulted in the typical cellular acidification as induced by hypoxia in plants (40Geigenberger P. Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 2003; 6: 247-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). The pH of the mitochondrial matrix is generally assumed to be slightly more basic than the cytosol but is documented to follow fluctuations of the cytosolic pH (42Felle H.H.

Microbiology. 2009; 155: 268-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Experiments using pH-sensitive fluorescent probes that were specifically targeted toward the mitochondria of HeLa cells revealed a marked decrease in the pH of the matrix after providing the cells with organic acids like lactate, pyruvate, or acetate (44Llopis J.

As the cytosolic acidification of a hypoxic cell is caused by a combination of low ATP (43Felle H.H. Ann. Bot. 2005; 96: 519-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) and accumulation of organic acids like lactate and succinate (32van Dongen J.T. Fröhlich A. Ramírez-Aguilar S.J. Schauer N. Fernie A.R. Erban A. Kopka J. Clark J. Langer A. Geigenberger P. Ann. Bot. 2009; 103: 269-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar), it must be assumed that the pH in the mitochondrial matrix of the hypoxic potato tubers that were used in our experiments decreased as well. This suggests that the dissociation of complex I from complexes III and IV that is observed during hypoxia and after decreasing the pH results from the changing pH in both cases. For mammalian mitochondria, a role of respiratory supercomplexes was suggested in determining respiratory efficiency (47Rosca M.G. Vazquez E.J. Kerner J. Parland W. Chandler M.P. Stanley W. Sabbah H.N. Hoppel C.L. Cardiovasc. Res. 2008; 80: 30-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). After induced ischemic heart failure in dogs, dissociation of the large supercomplexes containing complex I, III, and IV and a concomitant decrease of respiratory activity of intact heart mitochondria was observed even though the capacity of the individual respiratory complexes was not affected by the treatment. In plants, the consequence of the separation between complex I and the combination of complexes III and IV for the flow of electrons through the mETC would be a shift toward supercomplex III2+IV cooperating with the alternative NADH dehydrogenases rather than with complex I. Consistently, the alternative NADH dehydrogenases are activated by lowered pH, whereas complex I is inhibited by a low pH (48Geisler D.A. Broselid C. Hederstedt L. Rasmusson A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 28455-28464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 49Rasmusson A.G. Geisler D.A. Møller I.M.

Moreover, complex I was also shown to be reversibly deactivated during hypoxia of mammalian mitochondria in a reactive nitrogen species-dependent manner (51Galkin A. Abramov A.Y. Frakich N. Duchen M.R. Moncada S. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 36055-36061Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). In plants, the dissociation of complex I from the large supercomplexes as observed here during hypoxia is suggested to favor the electron transmission from the alternative type 2 NAD(P)H dehydrogenases and succinate dehydrogenase to ubiquinone. This could help in oxidizing the pool of cytosolic NADH during hypoxia, which is required to prevent inhibition of glycolysis due NAD+ limitation (39Maas M.F. Krause F. Dencher N.A. Sainsard-Chanet A. J. Mol. Biol. 2009; 387: 259-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Summarizing, our results suggest that respiratory supercomplexes could be involved in directing the flow of electrons between different respiratory electron transport pathways of the plant mETC (Fig. 7). Dissociation of complex I from complexes III and IV occurs under hypoxic conditions, during which succinate accumulates as substrate of complex II, and alternative NAD(P)H dehydrogenases are favored above complex I as electron donors to ubiquinone due to cellular acidification. This response of the supercomplex composition could probably act as a regulatory mechanism involved in acclimation of respiration to stress conditions in which the cellular pH changes, such as hypoxia and anoxia.

https://openalex.org/W2065722852,"In open star clusters, where all members formed at about the same time, blue straggler stars are typically observed to be brighter and bluer than hydrogen-burning main-sequence stars, and therefore should already have evolved into giant stars and stellar remnants. Correlations between blue straggler frequency and cluster binary fraction, core mass, and radial position suggest that mass transfer or mergers in binary stars dominates the production of blue stragglers in open clusters. Analytic models, detailed observations, and sophisticated N-body simulations, however, argue in favor of stellar collisions. Here we report that the blue stragglers in long-period binaries in the old (7 Gyr) open cluster NGC 188 have companions with masses of about half a solar mass, with a surprisingly narrow mass distribution. This conclusively rules out a collisional origin, as the collision hypothesis predicts a companion-mass distribution with significantly higher masses. Mergers in hierarchical triple stars are marginally permitted by the data, but the observations do not favor this hypothesis. The data are closely consistent with a mass transfer origin for the long-period blue straggler binaries in NGC 188, in which the companions would be white dwarfs of about half a solar mass."

These polysaccharides are composed of disaccharide repetition moieties made up of sulfated rhamnose linked to either glucuronic acid, iduronic acid, or xylose. Two ulvan lyases of 30 and 46 kDa were purified from the culture supernatant of Persicivirga ulvanivorans. Based on peptide sequencing, the gene encoding the 46-kDa ulvan lyase was cloned. Sequence analysis revealed that the protein is modular and possesses a catalytic module similar to that of the 30-kDa ulvan lyase along with a module of unknown function. The ulvan-degrading function of the gene was confirmed by expression of the catalytic module in a heterologous system. The gene encoding the catalytic module has no sequence homolog in sequence databases and is likely to be the first member of a novel polysaccharide lyase family. Analysis of degradation products showed that both the 30- and 46-kDa ulvan lyases are endolytic and cleave the glycosidic bond between the sulfated rhamnose and a glucuronic or iduronic acid."

Gene transcription in eukaryotic cells is a complex process that consists of a series of molecular events. Among these events, post-translational histone modifications alter the interaction of histones and DNA or histones and other nuclear proteins, and thus change local chromatin structures to affect gene transcription (1Berger S.L.

To decode the epigenetic language of covalent histone modifications, it is important to have “readers,” which recognize specific histone modification marks and entail downstream effects such as recruiting other chromatin remodeling complexes. The “writer-reader” interplay influences the dynamics of local chromatin structures and affects gene transcription, DNA repair, replication, and other chromatin-based events (2Campos E.I. Reinberg D. Annu. Rev. Genet. 2009; 43: 559-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar, 18Taverna S.D. Li H. Ruthenburg A.J. Allis C.D. Patel D.J. Nat. Struct. Mol.

Among “reader” proteins that have been identified, proteins containing tudor, the malignant brain tumor (MBT), and chromo domains could recognize methylated lysine residues within histones (20Kim J. Daniel J. Espejo A. Lake A. Krishna M. Xia L. Zhang Y. Bedford M.T. EMBO Rep. 2006; 7: 397-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). One such protein, chromodomain Y-like (CDYL), contains a chromodomain and has been implicated in the repression of gene transcription (21Caron C. Pivot-Pajot C. van Grunsven L.A. Col E. Lestrat C. Rousseaux S. Khochbin S. EMBO Rep. 2003; 4: 877-882Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). CDYL belongs to a multigene family called the CDY-related gene family, members of which have been shown to play important roles in mammalian spermatogenesis (22Dorus S. Gilbert S.L. Forster M.L. Barndt R.J. Lahn B.T. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2003; 12: 1643-1650Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In addition to the N-terminal chromodomain, CDYL has a C-terminal enoyl-coenzyme A (CoA) hydratase-isomerase catalytic domain, whose function remains unknown. Biochemical studies have identified CDYL as a component of repressor complexes CtBP (23Shi Y. Sawada J. Sui G. Affar el B. Whetstine J.R. Lan F. Ogawa H. Luke M.P. Nakatani Y. Shi Y. Nature. 2003; 422: 735-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar) and REST/CDYL/G9a. In the latter case, CDYL bridges the transcription repressor REST and the histone methyltransferase G9a (24Mulligan P. Westbrook T.F. Ottinger M. Pavlova N. Chang B. Macia E. Shi Y.J. Barretina J.

Although CDYL is believed to play a role primarily in transcriptional repression, CDYL target genes are largely unknown and biological functions of this protein are poorly understood. In our present study, we found that CDYL specifically recognizes H3K27me2 and H3K27me3 modifications and directly interacts with EZH2, the catalytic component of PRC2. CDYL drastically stimulates the histone methyltransferase activity of PRC2 toward oligonucleosome substrates. Genome-wide identification of CDYL target genes revealed that CDYL and PRC2 methyltransferase share a significant number of common binding sites. CDYL is required for the presence and maximal enzymatic activity of PRC2 at their common target promoters. Taken together, we propose CDYL functions as the missing link in the positive feedback regulation of PRC2 activity along the chromatin by bridging PRC2 and H3K27me3 modifications. Through modulating the enzymatic activity and chromatin recruitment of PRC2, CDYL could participate in various biological functions of the complex. Histone binding assays were performed essentially as described previously (25Shi X. Hong T. Walter K.L. Ewalt M. Michishita E. Hung T. Carney D. Peña P. Lan F. Kaadige M.R. Lacoste N. Cayrou C.

Briefly, recombinant full-length or the chromodomain of CDYL (del 2)-GST fusion proteins were expressed in E. coli strain BL21 and purified by glutathione-affinity resin (Amersham Biosciences). Fusion proteins (10, 15, or 20 μg) were incubated with 10 μg of native calf thymus histones (Worthington) in binding buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 m NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethyl sulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) plus protease inhibitors (Roche)) at 4 °C for 4 h. Alternatively, GST fusion proteins were incubated with 10 μg of recombinant histone octamers, which were prepared by mixing the four unfolded Xenopus laevis recombinant histones in equimolar amounts as previously described (26Luger K.

Protein complexes were pulled down with glutathione beads, washed five times with the binding buffer, and subjected to Coomassie Blue staining (Fig. 1A) or Western blotting using anti-H3 antibodies (Abcam catalogue no. 1791, Fig. 1B).

Unmodified H3 peptides (1–20 and 21–40) were synthesized by ChinaPeptides, and all modified H3 peptides were purchased from Millipore. Five micrograms of purified GST or GST-CDYL del2 proteins were incubated with 0.2 μg of biotinylated histone peptides in 100 μl of binding buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 0.3 mg/ml BSA plus protease inhibitors) overnight at 4 °C. Protein-peptide complexes were pulled down with streptavidin beads (Millipore), washed five times with the binding buffer, and subjected to Western blotting using anti-GST antibodies (MBL, Fig. 1C). More stringent conditions were used for the peptide pull-down assays in Fig. 4E. 2.5 μg of histone peptides were first incubated with streptavidin beads in the binding buffer containing 0.1% Nonidet P-40 and 300 mm NaCl overnight, and the beads were washed five times with the binding buffer before they were mixed with baculovirus-expressed FLAG-CDYL or FLAG-EED proteins. FLAG-CDYL (0.2, 0.4, or 1 μg) and FLAG-EED (0.6, 1.2, or 3 μg) proteins were used to determine the binding affinity for H3K27me3 of the two proteins. One μg of FLAG-CDYL or 3 μg of FLAG-EED proteins were incubated with unmodified H3 peptides (21–44) for the control reactions. After incubation, the beads were washed again five times with the binding buffer, and bound proteins were subjected to Western blotting using anti-FLAG antibodies.FIGURE 4CDYL enhances PRC2 activity in vitro. A, Coomassie Blue staining of PRC2 complexes (containing EZH2, SUZ12, and EED) purified from Sf9 cells. B, MNase digestion of reconstituted oligonucleosomes resolved by 2% agarose gel. Left panel: lane 1 shows the pure pG5E4 plasmid DNA, and lane 2 shows band shift of pG5E4 DNA assembly into oligonucleosomes. Right panel: equimolar amounts of reconstituted oligonucleosomes were digested with increasing amounts of MNase (Sigma). The DNA was isolated and subjected to electrophoresis on a 2% agarose gel in the presence of ethidium bromide. Partial MNase digestion (oligonucleosome: MNase = 2 μg: 0.5 μl) generated a nucleosomal DNA ladder with visible mono-, di-, and trinucleosomal fragments, which are indicated by corresponding numbers of asterisks. Mononucleosomal DNA runs as a 147 bp fragment. C, CDYL stimulates PRC2 activity in vitro. Reconstituted recombinant oligonucleosomes were incubated with EZH2/SUZ12/EED complexes (PRC2-core) in the absence or presence of increasing amounts of baculovirus generated CDYL and histone methyltransferase activity was determined by standard HMT assays. The reaction products were examined by Western blotting with the antibodies indicated on the right. Ponceau staining of histones is shown in the bottom panel to show equal amounts of substrates used in each reaction. D, CDYL only stimulates PRC2 methyltransferase activity toward oligonucleosome, but not mononucleosome substrates. Reconstituted Xenopus oligonucleosomes were digested with MNase (oligonucleosome: MNase = 1 μg: 1 μl) at room temperature for 5 min. This treatment yielded mainly mononucleosomes (see Fig. 4B). Equal amounts of mononucleosomes were used as substrates for the HMT assay in the top panel, whereas equal amounts of undigested oligonucleosomes were used as substrates in the bottom panel. Commercially available EZH2/EED/SUZ12/RbAp48/AEBP2 complexes (PRC2-full) were used to provide methyltransferase activity as indicated. The mild increase of PRC2 activity seen upon CDYL addition in the top panel was mainly due to incomplete digestion of oligonucleosomes (see Fig. 4B). E, binding affinity between CDYL and H3K27me3 is much stronger than the affinity between EED and H3K27me3. In the top panel, histone peptide binding assays show that CDYL, but not EED, binds to H3K27me2 when the same amounts of FLAG-tagged proteins (0.5 μg) were used in the assay. To compare the binding affinity for H3K27me3, 0.2, 0.4, or 1 μg of baculovirus-expressed FLAG-CDYL and 0.6, 1.2, or 3 μg of FLAG-EED proteins were used in the peptide binding assay. Ten percent of total proteins were used as loading controls (middle panel). Peptide-protein complexes were pulled down by streptavidin beads and bound proteins were examined by Western blotting using anti-FLAG antibodies (bottom panel). Ponceau staining of baculovirus-expressed FLAG-CDYL and FLAG-EED is shown in the right panel.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) MCF-7 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum.

Full-length EZH2 was transcribed/translated in vitro from the plasmid FLAG-EZH2/pcDNA3.1, as described in our previous work (30Shi B. Liang J. Yang X. Wang Y. Zhao Y. Wu H. Sun L. Zhang Y. Chen Y.

Full-length SUZ12 and EED, and EZH2 deletion mutants were cloned into the plasmid pGBKT7, which contains a c-Myc epitope tag, and transcribed/translated in vitro. Anti-EZH2 and anti-Myc (MBL) antibodies were used to detect the respective translated proteins. MCF-7 nuclear extracts were prepared and dialyzed against buffer D (20 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 10% glycerol, 0.1 mm EDTA, 300 mm NaCl). FPLC was performed as previously described (33Li R. Zhang H. Yu W.

Superose 6 or Superdex 200 10/300 GL Chromatographic Separation Columns (Amersham Biosciences) were used to purify protein complexes. The baculovirus constructs were generated by insertion of the open reading frame of human EZH2, SUZ12, EED, or CDYL into the pFastBac HT A vector (Invitrogen) between the BamH1 and Xho1 sites. Each construct contained a C-terminal FLAG tag for further affinity purification. The viruses were generated and amplified according to the manufacturer's protocol. To purify CDYL proteins, sf9 cells were infected at a multiplicity of infection of 10 with viruses expressing FLAG-CDYL. Cells were harvested after 3 days and lysed by sonication, and the lysate was incubated for 4 h with M2 agarose beads (Sigma). Washes were performed with BC500 buffer containing 50 mm Tris, 2 mm EDTA, 500 mm KCl, 10% glycerol, and protease inhibitors. Proteins were eluted with FLAG peptide at a 0.2 mg/ml concentration. EZH2/EED/SUZ12 complexes were generated by co-infecting sf9 cells with viruses expressing FLAG-tagged EZH2, EED, and SUZ12. Recombinant Xenopus histone octamers were prepared as described previously (26Luger K. Rechsteiner T.J. Flaus A.J. Waye M.M. Richmond T.J. J. Mol.

The plasmid pG5E4 (containing 10 5 S rDNA nucleosome positioning sequences) was mixed with recombinant histone octamers in equimolar amounts, and nucleosome arrays were assembled by stepwise salt dialysis according to a previous method (35Sims 3rd, R.J. Trojer P. Li G. Reinberg D. Methods. 2006; 40: 331-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). To examine the incorporation of histone octamers, the nucleosomal arrays were digested with micrococcal nuclease (MNase, Sigma catalogue no. N5386, dissolved the powder to make a 2 units/μl stock solution) and resolved by agarose electrophoresis as described previously (36Loyola A. Reinberg D. Methods. 2003; 31: 96-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Mononucleosomes were generated by digesting 10 μg of oligonucleosomes with 10 μl of MNase at room temperature for 5 min. HMT assays were performed as described previously (37Sarma K. Margueron R. Ivanov A. Pirrotta V. Reinberg D. Mol. Cell Biol. 2008; 28: 2718-2731Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). For Fig. 4C, 0.5 μg of baculovirus-expressed PRC2 complexes (containing EZH2, SUZ12, and EED) plus 0.05, 0.1, or 0.15 μg of baculovirus-expressed CDYL proteins were added to the HMT reaction mixture. The reaction was stopped by adding SDS buffer. For Fig. 4D, 0.5 μg of recombinant human EZH2/EED/SUZ12/RbAp48/AEBP2 complexes (BPS Bioscience catalogue no. 51004) were used to provide methyltransferase activity and 2 μg of recombinant oligonucleosomes or mononucleosomes were used as substrates. CDYL proteins (0.03 or 0.1 μg) or BSA proteins (0.1 μg) were added to the reaction as indicated. The HMT assays with fractions of FPLC elutes (Fig. 2D) were performed by incubation of the fractions with 2 μg of recombinant Xenopus histone H3 proteins in a 50 μl reaction volume with HMT buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, 4 mm EDTA, 1 mm PMSF, 0.5 mm DTT, pH 7.9) and 0.3 μm S-adenosyl-l-methionine for 1 h at 30 °C. The samples of HMT reactions were subjected to Western blotting using anti-H3K27me3 antibodies. MCF-7 cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Approximately 5 × 107 cells were used for each ChIP-seq assay. ChIP assays were performed according to a previous protocol proportionally scaled up for each step (38Shang Y. Hu X. DiRenzo J. Lazar M.A. Brown M. Cell. 2000; 103: 843-852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1445) Google Scholar). The chromatin DNA precipitated by either normal rabbit IgG (control) or polyclonal CDYL antibodies (Abcam, ab5188) was purified with the Qiagen PCR purification kit. In-depth whole genome DNA sequencing was performed by the Beijing Genome Institute (BGI). The raw sequencing image data were examined by the Illumina analysis pipeline, aligned to the unmasked human reference genome (NCBI v36, hg18) using ELAND (Illumina), and further analyzed by MACS. Enriched binding peaks of CDYL were generated after filtering through the control IgG data. Genomic distribution of CDYL binding sites was analyzed by using the cis-regulatory element annotation system. De novo motif screening was performed on sequences ±125 bp from the centers of CDYL binding peaks by using the CEAS and MEME systems. ChIP-seq density of histone modification enrichment profiles were obtained through GEO. Heatmaps and correlation maps were generated by R. siRNAs were synthesized by Shanghai GenePharma Co., Ltd. The sequences were as follows: CDYL-siRNA#3 sense: GAGAUAUUGUGGUCAGGAAtt; antisense: UUCCUGACCACAAUAUCUCtt; CDYL-siRNA#4 sense: GGUACAUCUCCGUUCAUGGtt; antisense: CCAUGAACGGAGAUGUACCtt; non-silencing siRNA sense: UUCUCCGAACGUGUCACGUtt, antisense: ACGUGACACGUUCGGAGAAtt. siRNAs were transfected into MCF7 cells using LipofectamineTM RNAiMAX (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Previous studies have suggested that CDYL functions mainly as a transcription corepressor in somatic cells (21Caron C. Pivot-Pajot C. van Grunsven L.A. Col E. Lestrat C. Rousseaux S. Khochbin S. EMBO Rep. 2003; 4: 877-882Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 39Li X. Liang J. Yu H. Su B. Xiao C. Shang Y. Wang W.

Cell Biol. 2008; 28: 269-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). CDYL contains an N-terminal chromodomain, which often serves as a recognition module for methylated histone lysine residues. To elucidate the mechanism of CDYL action in transcription regulation, we first characterized the histone binding preference of CDYL. Histone binding assays were performed using native calf thymus total histones (CTH) as substrates. Recombinant CDYL protein mainly interacted with H3, but not H4, H2A, or H2B (Fig. 1A, lanes 5–7). The chromodomain of CDYL is responsible for the histone binding ability of the protein, as the CDYL truncation mutant containing only the chromodomain (CDYL del2)-bound histone H3 as efficiently as the full-length protein (Fig. 1A, lanes 8–10). To examine whether the binding between CDYL and H3 is dependent on post-translational modifications of H3, we compared the binding affinity of CDYL to native CTHs, which retain multiple in vivo modifications, and to recombinant Xenopus octamers, which possess no post-translational modifications. CDYL was found to interact only with native H3 but not recombinant H3 proteins (Fig. 1B), suggesting that post-translational modifications of H3 are critical for the recruitment of CDYL. As expected, deletion of the chromodomain of CDYL (CDYL del3) completely abolished the interaction between CDYL and native H3 proteins (Fig. 1B, compare GST-del2 and GST-del3). We further examined the binding preference of CDYL for histone modifications by using histone peptide binding assays. CDYL was found to strongly interact with the repressive H3 lysine methylation marks, including H3K9me3, H3K27me2, and H3K27me3 (Fig. 1C), whereas no binding could be detected for H3K4 methylation modifications, which are largely associated with transcriptional activation. Our observations are consistent with previous reports (24Mulligan P. Westbrook T.F. Ottinger M. Pavlova N. Chang B. Macia E. Shi Y.J. Barretina J. Liu J. Howley P.M. Elledge S.J. Shi Y. Mol.

CDYL interacts with both methylated H3K9 residues and G9a, a histone methyltransferase for H3K9, suggesting that CDYL may bridge histone methylation and the modification enzyme. The strong interaction between CDYL and H3K27me2/H3K27me3 prompted us to examine whether CDYL was able to directly interact with the H3K27 methyltransferase, PRC2. To examine the in vivo interaction between CDYL and PRC2, total proteins from MCF-7 cells were extracted and immunoprecipitated with anti-CDYL antibodies. The immunoprecipitates were then immunoblotted with antibodies against the core components of PRC2. The results showed that endogenous EZH2 and SUZ12 could be efficiently co-immunoprecipitated with CDYL (Fig. 2A, top two panels). Because EED runs close to the immunoglobulin heavy chain in SDS-PAGE, we performed the EED-CDYL co-immunoprecipitation assay using MCF-7 cells transfected with a FLAG-CDYL construct. Cell lysates were collected 48 h after transfection and immunoprecipitated with the polyclonal antibody against EED. The immunoprecipitates were then immunoblotted with monoclon"

https://openalex.org/W2023174745,"Determining the structure of the ligand-binding domain of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) has been a long standing goal in the design of selective drugs useful in implicated diseases for this prevalent receptor family. Acetylcholine-binding proteins have proven to be valuable surrogates with structural similarity and sequence identity to the extracellular domain of the nicotinic receptor, yet these soluble proteins have their unique features and do not serve as exact replicates of the nAChRs of interest. Here we systematically modify the sequence of these proteins toward the homomeric human α7 nAChR. These chimeric proteins exhibit a shift in affinities to reflect α7 binding characteristics yet maintain expression levels and stability conducive for crystallization. We also present a pentameric humanoid nAChR extracellular domain with the structural determination of the α7 nAChR glycosylation site."
https://openalex.org/W2058188594,"Tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) is a well known cytokine involved in systemic and acute inflammation. In this study, we demonstrate that ceramide 1-phosphate (C1P) produced by ceramide kinase (CERK) is a negative regulator of LPS-induced TNFα secretion. Specifically, bone marrow-derived macrophages isolated from CERK knock-out mice (CERK−/−) generated higher levels of TNFα than the wild-type mice (CERK+/+) in response to LPS. An increase in basal TNFα secretion was also observed in CERK−/− murine embryonic fibroblasts, which was rescued by re-expression of wild-type CERK. This effect was due to increased secretion and not transcription. The secretion of TNFα is regulated by TNFα-converting enzyme (TACE also known as ADAM17), and importantly, the activity of TACE was higher in cell extracts from CERK−/− as compared with wild type. In vitro analysis also demonstrated that C1P is a potent inhibitor of this enzyme, in stark contrast to ceramide and sphingosine 1-phosphate. Furthermore, TACE specifically bound C1P with high affinity. Finally, several putative C1P-binding sites were identified via homology throughout the protein sequence of TACE. These results indicate that C1P produced by CERK has a negative effect on the processing/secretion of TNFα via modulation of TACE activity.

Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is the glycolipid of the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria (1Watson R.W. Redmond H.P. Bouchier-Hayes D. J.

Nature. 2002; 420: 885-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (2154) Google Scholar); however, hyperactivation of the immune response can also lead to the overwhelming production of tissue-damaging cytokines inducing septic shock. Sepsis or septic shock is a major cause of mortality with ∼120,000 deaths/year in the United States (5Martin G.S. Mannino D.M. Eaton S. Moss M. N. Engl. J. Med. 2003; 348: 1546-1554Crossref PubMed Scopus (4814) Google Scholar), and currently, there are no effective therapeutics available. LPS is recognized by immune cells via Toll-like receptors. Toll-like receptors are evolutionarily conserved proteins that recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns (6Takeda K. Kaisho T. Akira S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2003; 21: 335-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (4728) Google Scholar), and molecular studies coupled with genetic mouse models have identified TLR4 as an essential receptor for LPS signaling (7Lu Y.C. Yeh W.C. Ohashi P.S. Cytokine. 2008; 42: 145-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (2018) Google Scholar). Specifically, genetic mouse models lacking key molecules involved in TLR4-mediated signaling are protected from LPS-induced septic shock (8Akira S. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2000; 28: 551-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), and one key molecule produced in response to LPS is the proinflammatory/tissue-damaging cytokine, tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) (9Lin W.J. Yeh W.C. Shock. 2005; 24: 206-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). As alluded above, excessive production of proinflammatory cytokines like TNFα can cause deleterious effects on normal body functions (10Ramesh G. Reeves W.B. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 110: 835-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (711) Google Scholar). Injection of neutralizing antibodies against TNFα was considered a promising therapeutic approach to block LPS-induced septic shock (11Beutler B. Milsark I.W. Cerami A.C.

Therefore, characterization of TNFα downstream signaling cascades may aid in developing better therapeutics to modulate inflammatory cascades during the development of sepsis. With regard to signaling cascades, there are two main levels of regulation for TNFα production/secretion in response to LPS as follows: 1) induction of TNFα synthesis via the NF-κB pathway (18Collart M.A. Baeuerle P. Vassalli P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 1498-1506Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); and 2) induction of TNFα secretion via increased processing (e.g. shedding) of TNFα (19Horiuchi K. Kimura T. Miyamoto T. Takaishi H. Okada Y. Toyama Y. Blobel C.P. J. Immunol. 2007; 179: 2686-2689Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). With regard to secretion/“shedding,” TNFα is produced in the body as pro-TNFα, an inactive precursor of the cytokine in the form of a 233-amino acid membrane-anchored propeptide. Pro-TNFα is transformed into the active and soluble form by limited proteolysis at the Ala76 and Val77 bond by the protease, TNFα-converting enzyme (TACE 6The abbreviations used are: TACETNFα-converting enzymeC1Pceramide 1-phosphateCERKceramide kinaseBMDMbone marrow-derived macrophageMEFmurine embryonic fibroblastsSPRsurface plasmon resonancePOPC1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholinePOPE1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamineaSMaseacid sphingomyelinaseS1Psphingosine 1-phosphateCMCcritical micelle concentrationPAphosphatidic acidd-e-d-erythro-./ADAM17) (20Hoareau L.

Mature, active TACE is sequestered within cholesterol-rich membrane microdomains, otherwise known as lipid rafts or detergent-resistant microdomains (22Tellier E. Canault M. Poggi M. Bonardo B.

Neurochem. 2004; 89: 119-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Numerous substrates of TACE are localized in these rafts, and depletion of cholesterol from the lipid rafts by cyclodextrin or high density lipoprotein treatment increased the shedding of TACE substrates without increasing TACE activity (24Tellier E. Canault M. Rebsomen L. Bonardo B. Juhan-Vague I. Nalbone G. Peiretti F. Exp. Cell Res. 2006; 312: 3969-3980Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). As TACE regulates the secretion of TNFα, orally bioavailable TACE inhibitors may have the potential to effectively treat sepsis and other inflammatory diseases by limiting the levels of soluble TNFα release by cells (25DasGupta S. Murumkar P.R. Giridhar R. Yadav M.R. Bioorg. Med. Chem. 2009; 17: 444-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Indeed, inhibition of TACE by small molecular weight compounds has been more effective than TNFα neutralizing antibodies on alleviating septic shock in animal models (26Newton R.C. Solomon K.A. Covington M.B. Decicco C.P. Haley P.J. Friedman S.M. Vaddi K. Ann. Rheum. Dis. 2001; 60: iii25-iii32PubMed Google Scholar). Hence, researchers are actively pursuing the development of small molecules as orally bioavailable TACE inhibitors (27Le G.T. Abbenante G. Curr. Med. Chem. 2005; 12: 2963-2977Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In this study, we find that genetic ablation of the enzyme, ceramide kinase (CERK), leads to a significant increase in TNFα production in response to LPS. Mechanistic studies demonstrate that the increase in TNFα is due to an increase in TNFα processing/shedding. Finally, this study demonstrates that the loss of CERK leads to an increase in TACE activity, and TACE is directly and specifically inhibited by the product of CERK, ceramide 1-phosphate (C1P). Macrophage colony-stimulating factor was obtained from Sigma. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM), RPMI, fetal bovine serum (FBS), and penicillin/streptomycin (100 units/ml penicillin G sodium and 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate) were obtained from Invitrogen. HPLC used was a Shimadzu Prominence LC-20-AD system, and the mass spectrometer was a 4000 QTRAP from ABSciex. Prior to mass spectrometric analysis, lipids were separated by reverse phase chromatography using a Phenomenex Kinetex 2.6-μ C18 100A 50 × 2.1-mm reverse phase HPLC column (Torrance, CA).

For experiments, BMDMs were seeded in 6-well plates (5 × 105 cells/35-mm well), and incubated for 24 h at standard incubator conditions. The BMDMs were then stimulated by LPS (0.5 ng/ml) or treated with PBS sham control. The medium was collected at various times for TNFα quantification. For mass spectrometric quantification of lipids, the BMDM (1 × 106 cells) were grown in 100-mm plates under the same condition as above for the same length of time. The cells were harvested and lipids quantified by HPLC ESI-MS/MS as described previously (30Wijesinghe D.S. Allegood J.C. Gentile L.B. Fox T.E. Kester M. Chalfant C.E. J.

The cells were passaged every 3 days, and after 20 serial passages of the primary MEFs, immortalized MEFs were obtained. For experiments, immortalized MEFs were seeded in 6-well plates (5 × 105 cells/35 mm well) and incubated for 24 h at standard incubator conditions. The medium was changed to Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 2% fetal bovine serum before treatment and TNFα quantification. TNFα levels were measured using mouse TNFα EIA kit (PeproTech) following the manufacturer's instructions. The kit uses a monoclonal antibody to mouse TNFα immobilized on a microtiter plate to bind the mouse TNFα in the samples. After a short incubation, polyclonal antibody to mouse TNFα was added. This antibody bound to the mouse TNFα captured on the plate. After another short incubation, a donkey anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to HRP was added, which bound to the polyclonal mouse TNFα antibody. The reaction was stopped, and the color generated was read at 450 nm using a microplate spectrophotometer (BMG Labtech FLUOStar Optima). The measured optical density was directly proportional to the concentration of TNFα. To evaluate the transcript level of TNFα, total RNA from BMDMs was isolated using RNeasy kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Total RNA (1 μg) was reverse-transcribed using Superscript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) as described previously (32Chalfant C.E. Rathman K. Pinkerman R.L. Wood R.E. Obeid L.M. Ogretmen B.

Briefly, recombinant human TACE (0.2 ng/ml) was premixed for 5 min with Triton X-100 micelles (10 times CMC) at 37 °C prior to the addition of substrate. Of note, the addition of Triton X-100 below CMC and ≤20× CMC had no effect on in vitro TACE activity. To prepare the lipid-containing micelles, an appropriate volume of the indicated phospholipids (previously solubilized in an appropriate organic solvent) was dried under nitrogen. Triton X-100 at 20× CMC in TACE assay buffer was added to the dried lipid to produce a 2× concentrated lipid/micelle solution for each designated mol %. The solution was vortexed vigorously for 2 min followed by probe sonication (1 min on and 1 min off for 3 min) on ice. The lipid/micelle solution was then added to the enzyme to a final concentration of 10× CMC for Triton X-100 containing the designated mol % of lipid. The fluorescence emitted from the cleavage product was quantified by spectrofluorometry using excitation and emission wavelength of 320 and 405 nm, respectively and was used to calculate specific activity of TACE following the manufacturer's protocol. The data were plotted using SigmaPlot Version 12 (Systat Software). Recombinant adenovirus for ceramide kinase was generated using Adeno-XTM Tet-Off system (Clontech) followed by purification and titration using Adeno-XTM virus mini purification kit (Clontech) and Adeno-XTM rapid titer kit (Clontech), respectively.

Following washing of the sensor chip surfaces, POPC/POPE/X (70:20:10, where X = C1P, PA, S1P, or ceramide) and POPC/POPE (80:20) vesicles were injected at 5 μl/min onto the active surface and the control surface, respectively, to give the same resonance unit (6000 resonance units) values. Under our experimental conditions, no binding to the control surface was detected beyond the refractive index change for all proteins. Each lipid layer was washed three times with 10 μl of 50 mm NaOH at 100 μl/min. Typically, no decrease in lipid signal was seen after the first injection.

Our laboratory hypothesized that these compounds were acting as C1P mimetics and inhibiting TNFα production via an unknown mechanism. Therefore, our hypothesis infers that TNFα production would be increased in ex vivo cells derived from CERK−/− mice (e.g. cells lacking CERK-derived C1P). To test this hypothesis, MEFs from CERK−/− and CERK+/+ mice were grown under standard incubator conditions, and basal TNFα secretion was analyzed. Fig. 1A demonstrates that secreted TNFα was significantly increased in the media from MEFs derived from the CERK−/− mouse. To verify the phenotype and to specifically examine the role of CERK in the production of TNFα, “rescue” experiments were concomitantly undertaken. Specifically, CERK cDNA was re-introduced in CERK −/− MEFs by adenovirus-mediated transfection, and indeed, re-expression of CERK reduced the levels of secreted TNFα in accord with wild-type cells (Fig. 1A). These data demonstrate that the levels of TNFα are increased due to the specific loss of CERK expression. During the course of these studies, Nikolova-Karakashian and co-workers reported a role for ceramide derived from acid sphingomyelinase (aSMase) in LPS-induced secretion of TNFα in primary macrophages (59Rozenova K.A.

https://openalex.org/W2047365498,"Accumulating evidence indicates that the functional properties of soluble guanylyl cyclase (sGC) are affected not only by the binding of NO but also by the NO:sGC ratio and a number of cellular factors, including GTP. In this study, we monitored the time-resolved transformations of sGC and sGC-NO complexes generated with stoichiometric or excess NO in the presence and absence of GTP. We demonstrate that the initial five-coordinate sGC-NO complex is highly activated by stoichiometric NO but is unstable and transforms into a five-coordinate sGC-2 state. This sGC-2 rebinds NO to form a low activity sGC-NO complex. The stability of the initial complex is greatly enhanced by GTP binding, binding of an additional NO molecule, or substitution of βHis-107. We propose that the transient nature of the sGC-NO complex, the formation of a desensitized sGC-2 state, and its transformation into a low activity sGC-NO adduct require βHis-107. We conclude that conformational changes leading to sGC desensitization may be prevented by GTP binding to the catalytic site or by binding of an additional NO molecule to the proximal side of the heme. The implications of these observations for cellular NO/cGMP signaling and the process of rapid desensitization of sGC are discussed in the context of the proposed model of sGC/NO interactions and dynamic transformations."

During this key developmental time frame, embryonic pluripotent chromatin is established. In the egg, non-chromatin-bound histones are complexed with storage chaperone proteins, including nucleoplasmin. Here we describe the identification and characterization of a complex of the protein arginine methyltransferase 5 (Prmt5) and the methylosome protein 50 (Mep50) isolated from Xenopus eggs that specifically methylates predeposition histones H2A/H2A.X-F and H4 and the histone chaperone nucleoplasmin on a conserved motif (GRGXK). We demonstrate that nucleoplasmin (Npm), an exceedingly abundant maternally deposited protein, is a potent substrate for Prmt5-Mep50 and is monomethylated and symmetrically dimethylated at Arg-187. Furthermore, Npm modulates Prmt5-Mep50 activity directed toward histones, consistent with a regulatory role for Npm in vivo. We show that H2A and nucleoplasmin methylation appears late in oogenesis and is most abundant in the laid egg. We hypothesize that these very abundant arginine methylations are constrained to pre-mid blastula transition events in the embryo and therefore may be involved in the global transcriptional repression found in this developmental time frame.

Here, we report that nucleolin, a nucleolar protein highly expressed in undifferentiated ESCs, plays an essential role for the maintenance of ESC self-renewal. When nucleolin is knocked down by specific short hairpin RNA (shRNA), ESCs display dramatically reduced cell proliferation rate, increased cell apoptosis, and G1 phase accumulation. Down-regulation of nucleolin also leads to evident ESC differentiation as well as decreased self-renewal ability. Interestingly, expression of pluripotency markers (Oct4 and Nanog) is unaltered in these differentiated cells. Mechanistically, depletion of nucleolin up-regulates the p53 protein level and activates the p53-dependent pathway, at least in part, via increasing p53 protein stability. Silencing of p53 rescues G1 phase accumulation and apoptosis caused by nucleolin deficiency entirely, although it partially blocks abnormal differentiation in nucleolin-depleted ESCs. It is noteworthy that knocking down nucleolin in NIH3T3 cells affected cell survival and proliferation in a much milder way, despite the comparable silencing efficiency obtained in ESCs and NIH3T3 cells. Collectively, our data demonstrate that nucleolin is a critical regulator of ESC self-renewal and that suppression of the p53-dependent pathway is the major molecular mechanism underlying functions of nucleolin in ESCs.

A comprehensive understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying these special properties of ESCs is required to achieve the goal of clinical applications. Mouse ESCs can be maintained in an undifferentiated self-renewal state in the presence of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF). Withdrawal of LIF results in extensive ESC differentiation with reduced expression of pluripotency-associated factors (Oct4, Sox2, and Nanog), which play crucial roles in the maintenance of ESC properties (3Burdon T.

In contrast, the regulation of cell cycle progression and survival of ESCs has not been highly regarded, although they are important determinants for maintaining self-renewal. Mouse ESCs proliferate extraordinarily rapidly and take only 8–12 h to progress through a whole cell cycle, because of a lack of G0 phase and G1 checkpoint as well as a shortened G1 phase (2Boheler K.R.

However, the factors responsible for the distinct cell cycle characteristics and survival of ESCs remain largely unknown.

Recently, several studies have indicated that nucleolar proteins play pivotal roles in controlling stem cell proliferation and viability. For example, nucleostemin was shown to participate in controlling cell proliferation and survival in ESCs and adult stem cells (14Kafienah W. Mistry S. Williams C. Hollander A.P. Stem Cells. 2006; 24: 1113-1120Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 15Tsai R.Y. McKay R.D. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 2991-3003Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar, 16Nomura J. Maruyama M.

In addition, studies from our group and other groups have shown that nucleophosmin 1 (NPM1) is essential for mouse ESC growth (17Abujarour R. Efe J. Ding S. Stem Cells. 2010; 28: 1487-1497Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 18Wang B.B. Lu R. Wang W.C. Jin Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 347: 1129-1137Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Recently, we reported that another nucleolar protein Ly1 antibody reactive clone (LYAR) is required for cell proliferation and viability in ESCs (19Li H. Wang B. Yang A. Lu R. Wang W. Zhou Y. Shi G. Kwon S.W. Zhao Y. Jin Y. Stem Cells. 2009; 27: 1244-1254Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Interestingly, LYAR interacts with and inhibits the auto-cleavage activity of a nucleolar phosphoprotein, nucleolin, to stabilize its protein level. Nucleolin is known to be highly expressed in actively dividing cells (20Bugler B. Caizergues-Ferrer M. Bouche G. Bourbon H. Amalric F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1982; 128: 475-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), although it degrades because of auto-cleavage when cells become quiescent (21Lapeyre B. Bourbon H. Amalric F. Proc. Natl.

U.S.A. 1973; 70: 1316-1320Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar), numerous studies have focused on the structure, localization, and functions of nucleolin (25Tuteja R. Tuteja N. Crit. Rev.

This multiple domain-containing protein has a broad range of localizations and interacts with various RNAs, DNAs, and proteins, all of which are compatible with its multiple functions involved in the regulation of ribosome biogenesis and maturation, cell cycle, proliferation, apoptosis, transcription, and nucleogenesis (27Mongelard F.

FASEB J. 1999; 13: 1911-1922Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). Despite the great progress, the role of nucleolin in controlling ESC self-renewal has not been well defined. In this study, we generated tetracycline (Tc)-inducible nucleolin short hairpin RNA (shRNA) expressing ESC lines to study the function and underlying mechanism of nucleolin in mouse ESCs. Our data demonstrate that nucleolin is essential for maintaining the self-renewal ability of ESCs, because of its role in regulating cell cycle progression, proliferation, as well as prevention of apoptosis and differentiation. Mechanistically, knockdown of nucleolin resulted in an elevation in the protein level and activity of p53, a key transcription factor in controlling cell cycle progression and apoptosis. The elevated p53 protein level was, at least in part, due to the enhanced p53 protein stability. Activated p53 pathways led to the accumulation of cells in G1 phase, increased apoptosis, and obvious cell differentiation. Functionally, silencing of p53 expression completely canceled out G1 phase accumulation and apoptosis caused by depletion of nucleolin, whereas the abnormal differentiation phenomenon observed in nucleolin-deficient ESCs was partially rescued when p53 was knocked down. In contrast, nucleolin silencing affected cell proliferation and survival slightly in the differentiated cell type, NIH3T3 cells. Therefore, this study uncovers an important new regulator in the maintenance of the ESC self-renewal ability and establishes the functional link between nucleolar protein nucleolin and transcriptional factor p53 in mouse ESCs. For knockdown constructs, 19-bp shRNA sequences, corresponding to EGFP (5′-GGC TAC GTC CAG GAG CGC A-3′), nucleolin 1 (5′-AGG AAG AGA TAG TAA GAA A-3′), nucleolin 2 (5′-AGA GAA AGG TCA AAG GCA A-3′) were synthesized and constructed into the pTER+ vector, a kind gift from Hans Clevers (29van de Wetering M. Oving I. Muncan V. Pon Fong M.T. Brantjes H. van Leenen D. Holstege F.C. Brummelkamp T.R. Agami R. Clevers H. EMBO Rep. 2003; 4: 609-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar). The sequences of all plasmids were verified by DNA sequencing. The sequences for p53 siRNA oligo (Stealth RNAiTM duplex oligoribonucleotides, Invitrogen) are as follows: p53i-1 (5′-AGU ACG UGC ACA UAA CAG ACU UGG C-3′) and p53i-2 (5′-AUA UCC GAC UGU GAC UCC UCC AUG G-3′). All cell lines used in this study were cultured as described previously (19Li H. Wang B. Yang A. Lu R. Wang W. Zhou Y. Shi G. Kwon S.W. Zhao Y. Jin Y. Stem Cells. 2009; 27: 1244-1254Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Tc-inducible shRNA ESC lines or NIH3T3 cell lines were cultured in the medium for CGR8 cells or NIH3T3 cells, supplemented with 1 μg/ml puromycin (Sigma) and 50 μg/ml Zeocin (Invitrogen) in the absence or presence of Tc at the concentration of 100–300 ng/ml. CGR8 ESCs were plated at the density of 1 × 106 per 10-cm Petri dish and suspended to form EB without LIF for the indicated time. The establishment of inducible shRNA stable cell lines has been described previously (18Wang B.B. Lu R. Wang W.C. Jin Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Total RNA was extracted from cells according to the manufacturer's instructions using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) and reverse-transcribed into cDNA using oligo(dT)15 and ReverTra Ace reverse transcriptase (Toyobo). qPCR was performed in the ABI PRISM 7900 using SYBR Green PCR master mix (ABI), and the data were analyzed by the Sequence Detection System 2.3 software (ABI).

Tc-inducible shRNA ESCs were cultured with or without Tc for 2 days, then treated with cycloheximide (30 μg/ml, Sigma), and harvested at the indicated time points. The p53 protein levels were detected by Western blotting and quantified using ImageJ software. Cells were incubated with BrdU (Sigma) at the concentration of 10 μm for 30 min (ESCs) or 1 h (NIH3T3 cells) before harvesting. The amount of incorporated BrdU was detected by a Flow Cytometer (BD Biosciences) using a FITC-conjugated anti-BrdU monoclonal antibody (BD Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. ESCs or NIH3T3 cells were fixed with 70% ethanol for 24 h at 4 °C, followed by RNase (Sigma, 100 μg/ml) treatment for 30 min and propidium iodide (PI) (Sigma, 50 μg/ml) staining. The stained cells were analyzed by a Flow Cytometer (BD Biosciences) to determine the cell cycle distribution pattern. Tc-inducible shRNA ESCs were cultured with or without Tc for 3 days. Then these cells were harvested, and 105 cells were taken and stained with FITC-conjugated annexin V and PI (BD Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions for flow cytometric analysis. Tc-inducible shRNA ESCs were seeded at a low density in 6-well plates. After culturing with or without Tc for the indicated days, the colonies were fixed and stained with an AKP staining kit (Vector Laboratories) by a standard protocol. NIH3T3 cells were seeded onto 96-well plates at a density of 300 cells per well. 12 h after plating, 10 μl per well of 5 mg/ml MTT was added at the indicated time points, and 100 μl of dissolving buffer containing 10% SDS, 5% isopropyl alcohol, and 0.01 m HCl was added after incubation for 24 h. The absorbance was measured at 570 and 630 nm as the absorption and reference wavelength, respectively, after the cells were incubated for additional 12 h. Tc-inducible shRNA ESCs were treated with or without Tc for 3 days and then lysed in TRIzol for RNA extraction. RNA amplification for array analysis was performed with an Illumina TotalPrep RNA amplification kit (Ambion). Five milligrams of total RNA per sample were amplified and hybridized to Illumina Sentrix Mouse 6 BeadChip arrays according to the Illumina's instruction manual. Raw intensity data from BeadChip were exported to GeneSpring GX 9 and subjected to hierarchical clustering or pathway analysis. Three independent sets of samples were applied to microarray analysis. All values are shown as means ± S.D. The Student's t test was used to determine the significance of differences in comparisons. Values of p ≤ 0.05 were considered to be statistically significant. We began by examining the expression pattern of nucleolin during ESC differentiation. When cultured in suspension without LIF, ESCs can spontaneously form aggregates called EBs, which contain heterogeneous cell types representing all three embryonic germ layers (30Desbaillets I. Ziegler U. Groscurth P. Gassmann M. Exp. Physiol. 2000; 85: 645-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1A, the transcript level of nucleolin quickly decreased upon EB formation at day 4 and remained at a low level up to day 12. In line with ESC differentiation, the expression levels of the pluripotency marker Oct4 reduced dramatically, and the levels of differentiation-associated markers (Cdx2, Gata6, brachyury, and nestin) increased significantly during EB formation. In addition, the steady-state level of nucleolin proteins reduced evidently upon retinoic acid (RA) treatment, similar to the reduction in the level of Oct4 protein in RA-treated cells (Fig. 1B). These findings suggest that the expression of nucleolin is associated with the ESC status. To study the function of nucleolin in ESCs, we established ESC lines stably integrated with Tc-inducible shRNAs targeting nucleolin sequences. To rule out the off-target effect of the shRNA, two sequences (shRNA nucleolin 1 and shRNA nucleolin 2) targeting the nucleolin coding sequence were used. The efficiency of shRNA induced by Tc treatment was validated by both qPCR and Western blot analyses (Fig. 2, A and B). Clearly, Tc treatment remarkably reduced both mRNA and protein levels of nucleolin in either shRNA nucleolin ESC line but did not affect nucleolin expression in shRNA EGFP-expressing cells, indicating that the silencing of nucleolin expression was specifically brought about by Tc-induced expression of shRNA nucleolin but not by Tc treatment per se. Our previous study reported reduced cell growth and increased apoptosis when nucleolin expression was down-regulated in ESCs (19Li H. Wang B. Yang A. Lu R. Wang W. Zhou Y. Shi G. Kwon S.W. Zhao Y. Jin Y. Stem Cells. 2009; 27: 1244-1254Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). To further define the role of nucleolin in controlling ESC proliferation, BrdU incorporation assays were performed. Significantly, knockdown of nucleolin reduced the proportion of BrdU+ cell population in both shRNA nucleolin-expressing ESC lines (Fig. 2C). In agreement with this finding, both nucleolin-deficient ESC lines had a higher percentage of cells in G1 phase with a reduction in S phase cell proportion (Fig. 2D). These results suggest that nucleolin is critical for ESC proliferation and cell cycle progression. Next, we determined the effect of nucleolin silencing on early apoptosis using annexin V/PI staining approach. As shown in Fig. 2E, Tc-induced down-regulation of nucleolin led to an obvious increase in the annexin V+/PI− early apoptotic cell population. Consistently, Western blot analysis detected an elevation in the protein level of activated caspase 3 (17 kDa) in nucleolin-deficient ESCs (Fig. 2F), arguing for the requirement of nucleolin in the maintenance of ESC viability. Taken together, data obtained in this study demonstrate that the decrease in ESC growth rate caused by nucleolin depletion indicated in our previous study could be attributed to both increased cell apoptosis and reduced cell proliferation as a result from the cell accumulation in the G1 phase. In addition to the abnormality in cell cycle progression and apoptosis, we observed evidently differentiated cell morphology in shRNA nucleolin ESCs under the self-renewal culture conditions, suggesting that nucleolin might play a role in the maintenance of ESC at an undifferentiated state. We conducted ESC colony-forming assays (4Nichols J. Zevnik B. Anastassiadis K. Niwa H. Klewe-Nebenius D. Chambers I. Schöler H. Smith A. Cell. 1998; 95: 379-391Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2671) Google Scholar, 5Chambers I. Colby D. Robertson M. Nichols J. Lee S. Tweedie S. Smith A. Cell. 2003; 113: 643-655Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2637) Google Scholar) using Tc-inducible ESCs to evaluate the self-renewal ability of ESCs. Strikingly, knockdown of nucleolin expression for 3 days resulted in extensive cell differentiation, manifested as negative AKP staining and the differentiated cell morphology, whereas only few cells survived when the shRNA nucleolin ESCs were treated with Tc for 7 days (Fig. 3A). In contrast, shRNA EGFP ESCs formed typically compact AKP-positive colonies regardless of the presence or absence of Tc (Fig. 3A). This result suggests that nucleolin is required for ESC self-renewal, and its depletion could induce ESC differentiation and concomitant or consequent cell death. We then asked whether the differentiation induced by nucleolin silencing was specific to certain lineages or not. Transcript levels of various pluripotency- and differentiation-associated markers in shRNA nucleolin and shRNA EGFP ESCs treated with or without Tc for 3 days were analyzed. Data from qPCR analysis (Fig. 3B) indicated significant activation of all germ layer markers examined, including Cdx2 (trophectoderm), Gata6 (endoderm), brachyury (mesoderm), Fgf5 (primitive ectoderm), and nestin (ectoderm), upon silencing of nucleolin, implicating that ESC differentiation induced by nucleolin depletion is not biased to a specific lineage. Unexpectedly, the depletion of nucleolin did not reduce the expression of pluripotency genes (Oct4 and Nanog) as often seen in most ESC differentiation models. To verify the continued expression of pluripotency-associated markers in the nucleolin-depleted and substantially differentiated ESCs, their protein levels were examined. As shown in Fig. 3C, silencing of nucleolin did not affect the steady-state levels of Oct4, Nanog, and Sox2 proteins either. These observations indicate that down-regulation of nucleolin disrupts ESC self-renewal without altering the expression of pluripotency-related genes. To understand the molecular mechanism responsible for the function of nucleolin in ESCs, we carried out a genome-wide microarray analysis to identify genes or pathways associated with silencing of nucleolin. RNA samples of two shRNA nucleolin ESC lines and shRNA EGFP ESCs cultured with or without Tc for 3 days were subjected to microarray analysis. The expression profiles uncovered 803 genes whose expression levels changed by ≥2-fold (p values ≤0.05) when nucleolin expression was knocked down. These genes were then subjected to the hierarchical clustering analysis (Fig. 4A) and enriched pathway analysis (Fig. 4B) using the GeneSpring GX9 software. Clustering analysis indicated that the number of activated genes (670) was much larger than the number of repressed genes (258) in nucleolin-silenced ESCs (Fig. 4A). The activated genes mostly participate in regulation of cell apoptosis, proliferation, and differentiation processes. The pathway analysis revealed that the p53-dependent G1/S DNA damage checkpoint pathway and the p53-dependent G1 DNA damage-response pathway were enriched after nucleolin expression was silenced (Fig. 4B), suggesting that p53-dependent pathways might be involved in the function of nucleolin in ESCs. To validate the effect of nucleolin depletion on the activation of p53-dependent pathways, we examined the transcript levels of several p53 downstream genes related to its role in cell cycle regulation and apoptosis, including P21, cyclin G1, Bax, Wig1, Apaf1, etc. Data from qPCR analysis showed that all of the p53 target genes examined were significantly up-regulated when Tc induced depletion of nucleolin for 1 day (Fig. 4C), supporting that p53-dependent pathways were indeed activated in shRNA nucleolin ESCs, whereas the transcript level of p53 itself was only slightly elevated when Tc was added for 3 days (Fig. 4C). Consistent with activated p53-dependent pathways, we found that p53 protein levels increased gradually and significantly, whereas nucleolin protein levels decreased in a Tc treatment duration-dependent manner (supplemental Fig. S1A). The quantification data shown in Fig. 4D clearly revealed the inverse relationship between the protein levels of nucleolin and p53. To understand how nucleolin regulates p53 protein levels, we examined the influence of nucleolin down-regulation on p53 protein stability, as p53 protein levels are primarily controlled by regulation of its protein stability. The turnover rate of p53 protein in control cells and shRNA nucleolin cells was compared in the presence of the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide. We found that the stability of p53 proteins was significantly increased in nucleolin down-regulated ESCs (Fig. 4E and supplemental Fig. S1B). The result indicates that elevated p53 protein levels in shRNA nucleolin cells were, at least in part, due to the increased p53 protein stability. The contribution of activated p53-dependent pathways to nucleolin depletion-induced ESC phenotypes remains unknown, although regulation of p53 protein levels by nucleolin has been previously described in different types of human cells (31Saxena A.

To address this issue, we knocked down p53 expression using the synthesized p53 siRNA duplex oligoribonucleotides (oligos). Two p53 siRNA oligos (p53i-1 and p53i-2) as well as a negative control (N.C.) oligo were utilized. As shown in Fig. 5A, both p53i-1 and p53i-2 could substantially reduce the transcript level of p53 to less than 10% that in N.C.-transfected ESCs, without affecting the nucleolin level. Moreover, silencing of p53 expression entirely negated the activation of p53 target genes induced by silencing of nucleolin (Fig. 5A). We then examined the cell cycle profile of shRNA nucleolin 1 ESCs and shRNA EGFP ESCs transfected with N.C., p53i-1 and p53i-2, respectively, in the absence or presence of Tc. As shown in F"
https://openalex.org/W2024958741,"Low voltage-activated T-type Ca(v)3.2 calcium channels are expressed in neurosecretory chromaffin cells of the adrenal medulla. Previous studies have shown that naïve adrenal chromaffin cells express a nominal Ca(v)3.2-dependent conductance. However, Ca(v)3.2 conductance is up-regulated following chronic hypoxia or long term exposure to cAMP analogs. Thus, although a link between chronic stressors and up-regulation of Ca(v)3.2 exists, there are no reports testing the specific role of Ca(v)3.2 channels in the acute sympathoadrenal stress response. In this study, we examined the effects of acute sympathetic stress on T-type Ca(v)3.2 calcium influx in mouse chromaffin cells in situ. Pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating peptide (PACAP) is an excitatory neuroactive peptide transmitter released by the splanchnic nerve under elevated sympathetic activity to stimulate the adrenal medulla. PACAP stimulation did not evoke action potential firing in chromaffin cells but did cause a persistent subthreshold membrane depolarization that resulted in an immediate and robust Ca(2+)-dependent catecholamine secretion. Moreover, PACAP-evoked secretion was sensitive to block by nickel chloride and was acutely inhibited by protein kinase C blockers. We utilized perforated patch electrophysiological recordings conducted in adrenal tissue slices to investigate the mechanism of PACAP-evoked calcium entry. We provide evidence that stimulation with exogenous PACAP and native neuronal stress stimulation both lead to a protein kinase C-mediated phosphodependent recruitment of a T-type Ca(v)3.2 Ca(2+) influx. This in turn evokes catecholamine release during the acute sympathetic stress response."
https://openalex.org/W1972532914,"High mobility group N1 protein (HMGN1), a nucleosomal-binding protein that affects the structure and function of chromatin, is encoded by a gene located on chromosome 21 and is overexpressed in Down syndrome, one of the most prevalent genomic disorders. Misexpression of HMGN1 affects the cellular transcription profile; however, the biological function of this protein is still not fully understood. We report that HMGN1 modulates the expression of methyl CpG-binding protein 2 (MeCP2), a DNA-binding protein known to affect neurological functions including autism spectrum disorders, and whose alterations in HMGN1 levels affect the behavior of mice. Quantitative PCR and Western analyses of cell lines and brain tissues from mice that either overexpress or lack HMGN1 indicate that HMGN1 is a negative regulator of MeCP2 expression. Alterations in HMGN1 levels lead to changes in chromatin structure and histone modifications in the MeCP2 promoter. Behavior analyses by open field test, elevated plus maze, Reciprocal Social Interaction, and automated sociability test link changes in HMGN1 levels to abnormalities in activity and anxiety and to social deficits in mice. Targeted analysis of the Autism Genetic Resource Exchange genotype collection reveals a non-random distribution of genotypes within 500 kbp of HMGN1 in a region affecting its expression in families predisposed to autism spectrum disorders. Our results reveal that HMGN1 affects the behavior of mice and suggest that epigenetic changes resulting from altered HMGN1 levels could play a role in the etiology of neurodevelopmental disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2028559519,"Phosphatases of the regenerating liver (PRL) play oncogenic roles in cancer development and metastasis. Although previous studies indicate that PRL-1 promotes cell growth and migration by activating both the ERK1/2 and RhoA pathways, the mechanism by which it activates these signaling events remains unclear. We have identified a PRL-1-binding peptide (Peptide 1) that shares high sequence identity with a conserved motif in the Src homology 3 (SH3) domain of p115 Rho GTPase-activating protein (GAP). p115 RhoGAP directly binds PRL-1 in vitro and in cells via its SH3 domain. Structural analyses of the PRL-1·Peptide 1 complex revealed a novel protein-protein interaction whereby a sequence motif within the PxxP ligand-binding site of the p115 RhoGAP SH3 domain occupies a folded groove within PRL-1. This prevents the canonical interaction between the SH3 domain of p115 RhoGAP and MEKK1 and results in activation of ERK1/2. Furthermore, PRL-1 binding activates RhoA signaling by inhibiting the catalytic activity of p115 RhoGAP. The results demonstrate that PRL-1 binding to p115 RhoGAP provides a coordinated mechanism underlying ERK1/2 and RhoA activation.

Phosphatases of the regenerating liver (PRL) represent a unique subfamily of protein-tyrosine phosphatases with three members (PRL-1, -2, and -3), sharing a high degree (>75%) of amino acid sequence identity (1Diamond R.H.

PRL-1 was originally identified as an immediate-early gene whose expression was induced during liver regeneration after partial hepatectomy (1Diamond R.H. Cressman D.E. Laz T.M. Abrams C.S. Taub R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3752-3762Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Subsequently, PRL-1 expression was found to be elevated in many tumor cell lines, and cells expressing high levels of PRL-1 exhibit enhanced proliferation and anchorage-independent growth (1Diamond R.H.

For example, CHO or HEK293 cells stably expressing PRL-1 display enhanced motility and invasiveness (3Zeng Q. Dong J.M. Guo K. Li J. Tan H.X. Koh V. Pallen C.J. Manser E. Hong W.

Dong J.M. Guo K. Li J. Tan H.X. Koh V. Pallen C.J. Manser E. Hong W. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 2716-2722PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, an increase in PRL-1 expression enhances motility and invasion of colon adenocarcinoma cells (11Fiordalisi J.J. Keller P.J. Cox A.D. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 3153-3161Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar), whereas knockdown of endogenous PRL-1 inhibits human A549 lung cancer cell invasion (12Achiwa H. Lazo J.S. Cancer Res. 2007; 67: 643-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). These results suggest an oncogenic role for PRL-1 in cancer development and metastatic progression. Recent biochemical studies revealed that PRL-1 promotes cell proliferation and invasion by up-regulating both the ERK1/2 and RhoA pathways (10Sun J.P. Luo Y. Yu X. Wang W.Q. Zhou B. Liang F.

Lazo J.S. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2010; 334: 627-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). ERK1 and ERK2 are serine/threonine kinases that are required for many fundamental processes, including cell proliferation, survival, and motility (15Roux P.P. Blenis J. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2004; 68: 320-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (1880) Google Scholar), whereas the Rho family GTPases are recognized mainly as key regulators of actin cytoskeletal dynamics and cell migration (16Hall A. Science. 1998; 279: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (5168) Google Scholar, 17Bishop A.L. Hall A. Biochem. J. 2000; 348: 241-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (1655) Google Scholar). However, the underlying mechanism by which PRL-1 activates ERK1/2 and RhoA remains to be established. In an effort to identify novel effectors of PRL-1, we screened a phage display library and identified a PRL-1-binding peptide that corresponds to a sequence motif within the Src homology 3 (SH3) 3The abbreviations used are: SH3Src homology 3GAPGTPase-activating proteinSrGAPSlit-Robo GAPBisTris2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol. domain of p115 Rho GTPase-activating protein (GAP). Biochemical, cellular, and structural analyses revealed that p115 RhoGAP is a bona fide PRL-1-binding protein. Importantly, the interaction between PRL-1 and p115 RhoGAP promotes ERK1/2 activation by displacing MEKK1 (MAPK/ERK kinase kinase 1) from its inhibitor p115 RhoGAP. Moreover, we provide evidence that PRL-1 activates RhoA by directly inhibiting the catalytic activity of p115 RhoGAP. Src homology 3 GTPase-activating protein Slit-Robo GAP 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol. Anti-HA, anti-His, anti-GST, anti-RhoA, anti-actin, and anti-MEKK1 antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Anti-FLAG and anti-p115 RhoGAP antibodies were from Sigma. Anti-ERK1/2, anti-phospho-ERK1/2 (Thr-202/Tyr-204), and anti-Myc polyclonal antibodies were obtained from Cell Signaling (Beverly, MA). Anti-PRL-1 antibody was a generous gift from Dr. Qi Zeng. DMEM, fetal bovine serum, penicillin, and streptomycin were from Invitrogen. The Ph.D.-12 phage display peptide library kit (New England Biolabs) is based on a combinatorial library of a random 12-mer peptide fused to a minor coat protein (PIII) of M13 phage. The titer of the library is 1.5 × 1013 plaque-forming units. The library contains a complexity of 2.7 × 109 sequences. On day 1, 3 μg of recombinant PRL-1 was coated in a well of a 96-well plate at 4 °C overnight. On day 2, 200 μl of MPBS (2% (v/v) nonfat milk in PBS (137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 10 mm NaH2PO4, and 1.4 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.4)) was added to the well with shaking for 1 h at room temperature to block nonspecific binding. During this time, the input phage was mixed in 100 μl of MPBS and incubated for 1 h at room temperature in an empty well to allow any “sticky” phage to adhere to the plastic. The protein/MPBS solution was discarded, and the well was washed five times with 200 μl if PBST (0.1% (v/v) Tween in PBS). The phage/MPBS solution was transferred from the preclearing well to the PRL-1-coated well, followed by incubation for 2 h at room temperature with shaking. After washing away the unbound phage with 200 μl of PBST five times, the bound phage was eluted by the addition of 100 μl of 0.1 m HCl for 10 min at room temperature with shaking. The eluted phage was transferred to a tube and immediately neutralized by the addition of 50 μl of 1 m Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4. A small part of this output phage was used for titration, and the rest was amplified to obtain an input titer of 1013 phage for the following panning. A total of four rounds of panning were performed to obtain PRL-1-specific phage. Individual phage clones were amplified, and single-strand DNA was isolated according to the manufacturer's instructions. The sequence of the 12-amino acid PRL-1-binding peptide was obtained by DNA sequencing. HEK293 cells and mouse embryonic fibroblast cells were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin under a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. HEK293 cells were seeded at 40% confluency in antibiotic-free medium and grown overnight. Transfection was performed using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Cells were grown to 70% confluency, washed with ice-cold PBS, and lysed on ice for 30 min in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, and 10% glycerol) supplemented with a Complete protease inhibitor tablet (Roche Applied Science). Cell lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 15,000 rpm for 10 min. The lysate protein concentration was estimated using a BCA protein assay kit (Pierce). For immunoprecipitation, 3 μg of antibody was added to 1 mg of cell lysate and incubated at 4 °C for 4 h with protein A/G-agarose beads. After being extensively washed, the protein complex was boiled with sample buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred electrophoretically to a nitrocellulose membrane, and immunoblotted with appropriate antibodies, followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies. The blots were developed by the enhanced chemiluminescence technique (ECL kit, GE Healthcare). Representative results from at least two independent experiments are shown. Pulldown assays were performed with GST, GST-fused Peptide 1, or the GST-fused Slit-Robo GAP (SrGAP) SH3 domain bound to reduced glutathione-agarose after washing three times with Tris-buffered saline. Purified His-PRL-1 proteins or cell lysates containing HA-PRL-1 were added to immobilized GST fusion proteins in binding buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol 0.5% Triton X-100, 5 mm EDTA, and proteinase inhibitor mixture) and incubated for 2 h at 4 °C in a tube rotator. After centrifugation, the beads were kept on ice and washed three times for 5 min each with wash buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.1% Triton X-100, 5 mm EDTA, and proteinase inhibitor mixture). The washed beads were boiled in loading buffer for 5 min and separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Proteins were transferred to PVDF and immunostained with anti-His, anti-HA, and anti-GST antibodies. Effector pulldown assay was performed to monitor RhoA activity. Cells were lysed in buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 100 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mm NaF, and protease inhibitor mixture for 30 min at 4 °C. Cell lysate was incubated with the GST-fused Rho-binding domain of Rhotekin immobilized on reduced glutathione-agarose for 2 h at 4 °C in a tube rotator. The level of active RhoA was detected by Western blotting with anti-RhoA antibody. Immunoprecipitated p115 RhoGAP activity was measured by analyzing the ratio of GTP and GDP bound to RhoA as described (18Bollag G. McCormick F. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 255: 161-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Recombinant human RhoA protein was purified as described (19Quilliam L.A. Rebhun J.F. Zong H. Castro A.F. Methods Enzymol. 2001; 333: 187-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) and was loaded with [α-32P] GTP by incubation for 10 min at 30 °C in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mg/ml BSA, 6 μm GTP, 5 μCi of [α-32P]GTP, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. MgCl2 was added to 10 mm, and free nucleotide was removed by washing the beads three times with the loading buffer minus GTP. Proteins were then eluted by incubating the beads with 100 μl of 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mm MgCl2, and 20 mm glutathione on ice for 20 min. GTP-loaded RhoA was incubated with FLAG-p115 RhoGAP produced by transient transfection in 293 cells and immunoprecipitation with anti-FLAG antibody in a 50-μl final reaction volume containing 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1.5 mg/ml BSA, 7.5 mm MgCl2, and 2 mm dithiothreitol at room temperature for 1 h. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 4 μl of 0.5 m EDTA and 1 μl of 10% SDS; RhoA protein was denatured by incubation at 68 °C for 5 min; and guanine nucleotides were separated by thin layer chromatography on polyethyleneimine-cellulose TLC plates (Mallinckrodt Baker) using 0.75 m KH2PO4/HCl, pH 3.4, as the solvent. Chromatograms were dried, and Ras-bound GDP and GTP were visualized by autoradiography. Mouse embryonic fibroblast cells were cultured directly on glass coverslips in 6-well plates. Twenty-four hours later, cells were transfected with the indicated constructs. After an additional 24 h, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min at room temperature, permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min, and blocked with BSA. Monoclonal antibody to FLAG (M2) was applied for 1 h, followed by a 1-h incubation with Texas Red-conjugated anti-mouse immunoglobulin G (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories). DNA staining (0.5 μg of Hoechst 33258/ml; Sigma) was used to identify cell nuclei. After being washed with PBS, the coverslips were mounted with antifade mounting solution. Confocal microscope images were obtained with a Zeiss Axio Observer.Z1 microscope with a Plan Apochromat ×63 oil immersion objective and processed with Zeiss AxioVision 4.7. Cell migration was assessed as described previously (13Luo Y. Liang F. Zhang Z.Y. Biochemistry. 2009; 48: 1838-1846Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) with some modifications. The assay was performed with Corning Transwells (6.5-mm diameter, 8-μm pore size polycarbonate membrane; Costar, Acton, MA). Cells (3.75 × 105) in 1.5 ml of serum-free medium were placed in the upper chamber, whereas the lower chamber was loaded with 2.6 ml of medium containing 10% FBS. After incubation at 37 °C with 5% CO2 for 24 h, the total numbers of cells that migrated into the lower chamber were counted with a hemocytometer. Duplex siRNAs were provided by Proligo at a concentration of 50 μm. The siRNA sequences were as follows: human p115 RhoGAP-1, 5′-CUGAGGUGCCGCUGCUGGAdTdT (sense) and 5′-UCCAGCAGCGGCACCUCAGdTdT (antisense), target position 2880; and p115 RhoGAP-2, 5′-GCGUGAAUGCCGAGGCCAAdTdT (sense) and 5′-UUGGCCUCGGCAUUCACGCdTdT (antisense), target position 575. siRNAs were transfected by RNAiFect (Qiagen), and the knockdown of targeted genes was verified after 72 h by Western blot analysis. Luciferase assays were modified as described previously (13Luo Y. Liang F. Zhang Z.Y. Biochemistry. 2009; 48: 1838-1846Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Cells were transfected with the SRE.L triple-repeat promoter-luciferase construct (20Wells C.D. Gutowski S. Bollag G. Sternweis P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28897-28905Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Cells were harvested and lysed 48 h after transfection. Luciferase activities were determined using the luciferase assay system (Promega) according to the manufacturer's specifications. Individual assays were normalized by internal Renilla luciferase activity. Experiments were performed in triplicate and repeated three times with similar results. The statistics were done using Student's t test, with p < 0.05 considered significant. PRL-1 (7 mg/ml) was mixed with Peptide 1 at a molar ratio of 1:2, and PRL-1·Peptide 1 was co-crystallized by vapor diffusion in hanging drops at 4 °C. Drops containing 1:1 volumes of the protein in stock buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5) and reservoir solution A (20% PEG 3350, 0.1 m NaCl, and 0.1 m BisTris, pH 6.4) were equilibrated against reservoir solution A. The crystal was transferred into reservoir solution B (28% PEG 3350, 0.1 m NaCl, 0.1 m BisTris, pH 6.4, and 0.2 mm Peptide 1), soaked for 5 h, and flash-cooled in liquid nitrogen. X-ray data were collected at 100 K at Structural Biology Center Collaborative Access Team beamline 19-BM (Advanced Photon Source, Argonne, IL) equipped with a mosaic CCD detector. All data were processed with HKL3000 (21Otwinowski Z. Minor W.

Open table in a new tab The structure of PRL-1·Peptide 1 was solved by molecular replacement using the program AMoRe (22Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr.

Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 12009-12021Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) without the solvent molecules was used as the search model. The structure was refined to 2.8 Å resolution with the program CNS1.1 (24Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S.

The progress of the refinement was evaluated by the improvement in the quality of the electron density maps and the reduced values of the conventional R factor and the free R factor (with 3.3% of the reflections omitted from the refinement) (25Brünger A.T. Nature. 1992; 355: 472-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (3839) Google Scholar). Electron density maps were inspected, and the model was modified on an interactive graphics work station with the program O (26Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard G.J. Acta Crystallogr. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (12999) Google Scholar). Finally, water molecules were added gradually as the refinement progressed. They were assigned in the Fo − Fc difference Fourier maps with a 3σ cutoff for inclusion in the model. We hypothesized that the discovery of PRL-1-binding proteins may yield new insight into the mechanism that accounts for PRL-1-mediated ERK1/2 and RhoA activation. Using recombinant PRL-1 protein, we screened a phage display 12-mer peptide library and identified Peptide 1 (GWWSLIPPKYIT) as a putative PRL-1-binding peptide. Consistent with this peptide interacting with PRL-1, purified GST-Peptide 1 fusion protein, but not GST, was capable of precipitating His6-tagged recombinant PRL-1 from solution (Fig. 1A). The concentration-dependent displacement of PRL-1 from the GST-Peptide 1 fusion protein by synthetic Peptide 1, but not by a scrambled peptide, indicates the specificity of this interaction (Fig. 1B). In addition, GST-Peptide 1 pulled down HA-PRL-1 from HEK293 cell lysate (Fig. 1C), and GST-Peptide 1 readily co-immunoprecipitated with HA-PRL-1 when both were expressed in HEK293 cells (Fig. 1D). Collectively, these results indicate that Peptide 1 directly binds PRL-1 both in solution and in mammalian cells. To identify PRL-1-binding proteins, we launched a BLAST search using Peptide 1 as a query. The top hit was the human protein p115 RhoGAP (27Tribioli C. Droetto S. Bione S. Cesareni G. Torrisi M.R.

Huang Y.Z. Xie Y. Liu G. Saito H. Tang H. Wen L. Brady-Kalnay S.M. Mei L. Wu J.Y. Xiong W.C. Rao Y.

Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 970-975Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). All members of the SrGAP family (SrGAP1, -2, and -3 and p115 RhoGAP) contain an N-terminal FCH (Fes/CIP4 (Cdc42-interacting protein 4) homology) domain and a central RhoGAP domain, which is followed by an SH3 domain (27Tribioli C. Droetto S. Bione S. Cesareni G. Torrisi M.R. Lotti L.V. Lanfrancone L. Toniolo D. Pelicci P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1996; 93: 695-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 30Tcherkezian J. Lamarche-Vane N. Biol. Cell. 2007; 99: 67-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). Because Peptide 1 shares strong sequence identity with contiguous residues in the SH3 domains of all SrGAP proteins (Fig. 2A), we compared their relative association with PRL-1 by co-immunoprecipitation. For this purpose, FLAG-tagged p115 RhoGAP, SrGAP1, SrGAP2, and SrGAP3 were transfected into HEK293 cells stably expressing HA-PRL-1. Protein complexes were immunoisolated from cell lysates using anti-HA antibodies and immunoblotted with antibodies against FLAG and HA. This revealed that PRL-1 co-immunoprecipitated with all SrGAP family members (Fig. 2B). Consistently, GST pulldown assays demonstrated that PRL-1 could directly bind the SH3 domain of each SrGAP (Fig. 2C), but not a fragment of p115 RhoGAP lacking its SH3 domain or ArhGAP9, an SH3 domain-containing RhoGAP that is not in the SrGAP family (Fig. 2D). Furthermore, GST-Peptide 1 disrupted the intracellular association between PRL-1 and p115 RhoGAP (Fig. 2E). These findings suggest that PRL-1 binds p115 RhoGAP through a short motif in its SH3 domain. We next examined the subcellular co-distribution of PRL-1 and p115 RhoGAP. FLAG-tagged p115 RhoGAP and GFP-tagged PRL-1 were coexpressed in mouse embryonic fibroblast cells, and their cellular localization was visualized by confocal immunofluorescence microscopy (Fig. 2F). Consistent with previous observations (4Zeng Q. Si X. Horstmann H. Xu Y. Hong W. Pallen C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21444-21452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar), PRL-1 was associated with the plasma membrane as well as with intracellular punctate structures dispersed throughout the cytoplasm. Similar to the earlier finding that p115 RhoGAP localizes to the leading edges of cells via the FCH domain (31Vogt D.L. Gray C.D. Young 3rd, W.S. Orellana S.A. Malouf A.T. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2007; 36: 332-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), we observed that p115 RhoGAP resides primarily at the cell periphery, and this pattern of localization is independent of the SH3 domain. In agreement with our findings that p115 RhoGAP biochemically associates with PRL-1, these proteins highly co-localized at the plasma membrane and at the leading edges of cells. However, a mutant of p115 RhoGAP lacking the SH3 domain showed no co-localization with PRL-1. In addition, cotransfection of GST-Peptide 1 abrogated the co-localization of p115 RhoGAP and PRL-1. Taken together, these results support the conclusion that p115 RhoGAP is a specific PRL-1-binding protein and that a motif within the SH3 domain of p115 RhoGAP is required for binding PRL-1. We further suggest that Peptide 1 and a region within the SH3 domain of p115 RhoGAP bind a common site in PRL-1. Finally, we determined whether PRL-1 can bind p115 RhoGAP under endogenous conditions. PRL-1 is overexpressed in many lung cancer cell lines, including H1299 cells (5Wang J. Kirby C.E. Herbst R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46659-46668Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Knockdown of PRL-1 in H1299 cells significantly decreases cell proliferation and migration (13Luo Y. Liang F. Zhang Z.Y. Biochemistry. 2009; 48: 1838-1846Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). To demonstrate direct association of PRL-1 and p115 RhoGAP in H1299 cells, we used anti-PRL-1 antibodies to immunoprecipitate endogenous PRL-1. As shown in Fig. 2G, we detected p115 RhoGAP in the PRL-1 immunoprecipitates, indicating endogenous association between PRL-1 and p115 RhoGAP. To elucidate the molecular basis by which PRL-1 recognizes Peptide 1 and most likely the SH3 domain of p115 RhoGAP, we solved the crystal structure of PRL-1 in complex with Peptide 1 at 2.8 Å resolution. Data collection and structural refinement statistics are summarized in Table 1. The final atomic model encompasses residues 9–160 of PRL-1 in a complex with residues 4–12 of Peptide 1, as revealed by the unbiased Fo − Fc omit density map (Fig. 3A). Peptide 1 binds PRL-1 in an extended β-strand conformation that lies 18 Å away from the PRL-1 active site (defined by the P-loop (H103CVAGLGR110)) and 20 Å from the C terminus of PRL-1 (Fig. 3B). Complex formation between PRL-1 and Peptide 1 buries a contiguous surface area of 1140 Å2 in PRL-1. The structure of the PRL-1·Peptide 1 complex defines a novel protein-protein interaction site in PRL-1 through an unexpected mode of interaction with the SH3 domain of p115 RhoGAP. The first three residues in Peptide 1 are invisible in the structure, and Ser-4 is exposed to solvent. Thus, interactions between PRL-1 and these residues, if present, are likely to be weak. Detailed interactions between PRL-1 and the rest of Peptide 1 are shown in Fig. 3C. Leu-5 in Peptide 1 is engaged in hydrophobic interactions with Asp-54 and Thr-56 in PRL-1. Ile-6 is within van der Waals contacts with Asp-54 and forms two weak polar interactions with the side chains of Asp-54 and Thr-55. Hydrophobic interactions are observed between Pro-7 in Peptide 1 and the side chain of Thr-55 and the phenyl ring of Try-53 in PRL-1. Pro-8 is also within van der Waals contacts with Thr-55. Both Lys-9 and Tyr-10 contact PRL-1 His-64. In addition, hydrophobic interactions exist between Tyr-10 and the side chains of Asp-67 and Trp-68, and Ile-11 may interact with Leu-66 and Trp-68. Finally, Thr-12 may form weak interactions with PRL-1 Trp-68 and Gln-79. The residues within PRL-1 that are predicted to contact Peptide 1 from our structural data were probed for their requirement for interaction with both Peptide 1 and p115 RhoGAP. Serial truncations from either the N or C terminus of PRL-1 (full-length, 1–173) indicated that residues 1–120 and 30–173 still bound GST-Peptide 1, whereas fragments 1–90, 60–173, and 90–173 displayed no detectable binding (Fig. 3D). The results suggest that Peptide 1 likely binds within residues 30–120 in PRL-1. Additionally, the binding affinity of PRL-1 for Peptide 1 was significantly diminished when His-64 was replaced with Ala and completely abolished when Tyr-53 or Trp-68 was changed to Ala (Fig. 3E). Importantly, the latter two mutants also lacked the ability to immunoprecipitate p115 RhoGAP in HEK293 cells (Fig. 3F). These results are in complete agreement with the structural observations that the Tyr-53–Gln-79 sequence in PRL-1 is involved in binding Peptide 1. Importantly, residues within the Peptide 1-binding site are most likely also required for binding the analogous region within the SH3 domain of p115 RhoGAP. Taken together, these results reveal a novel mode of interaction between an SH3 domain and its binding partner, where PRL-1 serves as the receptor for recognizing a sequence motif (corresponding to Peptide 1 Leu-5–Thr-12) within the SH3 domain of p115 RhoGAP. As shown in the crystal structure of the SrGAP1 SH3 domain (32Li X. Chen Y. Liu Y. Gao J. Gao F. Bartlam M. Wu J.Y. Rao Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 28430-28437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), Pro-793 and Tyr-796 (Pro-7 and Tyr-10 in Peptide 1) form ligand-binding pocket 2, and Leu-791 (Leu-5 in Peptide 1) lines ligand-binding pocket 3. Because there is no PxxP sequence in PRL-1 and because residues involved in binding Peptide 1 are noncontiguous (Fig. 3C), the recognition of Peptide 1 and the p115 RhoGAP SH3 domain by PRL-1 represents a novel protein-protein interaction, which differs from the canonical SH3 domain/PxxP-binding mode. It is well documented that PRL-1 promotes cell migration through activation of the ERK1/2 and RhoA pathways (10Sun J.P. Luo Y. Yu X. Wang W.Q. Zhou B. Liang F. Zhang Z.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 29043-29051Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 11Fiordalisi J.J. Keller P.J. Cox A.D.

Lazo J.S. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2010; 334: 627-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). It has also been reported that p115 RhoGAP inhibits cell motility through its GAP and C-terminal SH3 domains (31Vogt D.L. Gray C.D. Young 3rd, W.S. Orellana S.A. Malouf A.T. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2007; 36: 332-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). To understand the functional significance of the novel interaction between PRL-1 and p115 RhoGAP, we evaluated the effect of modulating the expression of p115 RhoGAP on PRL-1-mediated cell migration as well as on ERK1/2 and RhoA activity. We found that overexpression of p115 RhoGAP in cells stably transfected with PRL-1 diminished PRL-1-induced cell migration (Fig. 4A). Overexpression of p115 RhoGAP in control cells also decreased basal migration, which is consistent with the previous report that p115 RhoGAP inhibits cell motility in NIH3T3 cells (31Vogt D.L. Gray C.D. Young 3rd, W.S. Orellana S.A. Malouf A.T. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2007; 36: 332-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In addition, p115 RhoGAP knockdown by siRNA enhanced cell migration in both control and PRL-1-expressing cells (Fig. 4B). Moreover, overexpression of p115 RhoGAP reduced PRL-1-mediated ERK1/2 and RhoA activation (Fig. 4C). Overexpression of p115 RhoGAP in control cells also reduced basal ERK and RhoA activity. The negative effect of p115 RhoGAP on RhoA signaling was further confirmed by a 40% decrease in the transcriptional activity of the RhoA-specific reporter SRE.L (Fig. 4D). We conclude that p115 RhoGAP plays a negative role in cell migration by down-regulating both ERK1/2 and RhoA activity. p115 RhoGAP has been previously found to associate with and inhibit MEKK1 through its SH3 domain (33Christerson L.B. Gallagher E. Vanderbilt C.A. Whitehurst A.W. Wells C. Kazempour R. Sternweis P.C. Cobb M.H. J. Cell. Physiol. 2002; 192: 200-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). MEKK1 is the essential upstream kinase that phosphorylates and activates ERK1/2 and is required for cell motility. Because the region in the SH3 domain of p115 RhoGAP that corresponds to Leu-5–Thr-12 in Peptide 1 makes up the center of the PxxP ligand-binding site, PRL-1 binding to this site was predicted to block canonical interactions with this domain. We further speculated that one consequence of such displacement of MEKK1 from p115 RhoGAP by PRL-1 would be the activation of ERK1/2. To test this hypothesis, control and PRL-1-expressing cells were transfected with FLAG-tagged p115 RhoGAP, and the amount of p115 RhoGAP associated with MEKK1 and the phosphorylation status of ERK1/2 were measured. Compared with control cells, the fraction of p115 RhoGAP associated with MEKK1 was reduced, and the ratio of phosphorylated ERK1/2 was increased in PRL-1 cells (Fig. 5A). This effect is likely specific, as expression of GST-Peptide 1 restored the level of p115 RhoGAP associated with MEKK1 and concordantly reduced ERK1/2 phosphorylation (Fig. 5A). Thus, PRL-1 interaction with p115 RhoGAP likely mitigates the inhibitory effect of p115 RhoGAP on MEKK1, resulting in ERK1/2 activation. Given that p115 RhoGAP inhibits RhoA by accelerating its catalysis of GTP hydrolysis to GDP (27Tribioli C. Droetto S. Bione S. Cesareni G. Torrisi M.R. Lotti L.V. Lanfrancone L. Toniolo D. Pelicci P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1996; 93: 695-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 33Christerson L.B. Gallagher E. Vanderbilt C.A. Whitehurst A.W. Wells C. Kazempour R. Sternweis P.C. Cobb M.H. J. Cell. Physiol. 2002; 192: 200-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), we investigated whether PRL-1 binding to p115 RhoGAP could modulate its ability to regulate RhoA activity. To this end, immunoprecipitated FLAG-tagged p115 RhoGAP or p115 RhoGAPΔSH3 from either control or PRL-1 cells was incubated with purified GST-RhoA loaded with [α-32P]GTP. The data revealed that p115 RhoGAP from PRL-1 cells showed significantly lower GAP activity than that from control cells (Fig. 5B). This inhibitory effect of PRL-1 on p115 RhoGAP activity likely occurs via interaction with the SH3 domain, as p115 RhoGAPΔSH3 exhibited equal GAP activity in PRL-1-expressing or control cells (Fig. 5B). To further define the mechanism by which PRL-1 inhibits the GAP activity of p115 RhoGAP, we measured the effect of PRL-1 on the binding of p115 RhoGAP to RhoA(G14V), a constitutively active form of RhoA that stably associates with the GAPs due to resisting GTP hydrolysis. Control and PRL-1-expressing cells were transfected with Myc-RhoA(G14V) and FLAG-tagged p115 RhoGAP or p115 RhoGAPΔSH3. The amount of RhoA(G14V) associated with p115 RhoGAP or p115 RhoGAPΔSH3 was visualized by Western blotting. The observation that both full-length p115 RhoGAP and p115 RhoGAPΔSH3 bound RhoA(G14V) indicates that recognition of RhoA by p115 RhoGAP does not require its SH3 domain. In stark contrast, the ability of PRL-1 to block the interaction between RhoA(G14V) and p115 RhoGAP strongly depended on the presence of the SH3 domain (Fig. 5C). Apparently, the association of PRL-1 with the SH3 domain of p115 RhoGAP prevents p115 RhoGAP from binding RhoA, and this results in increased levels of GTP-bound RhoA. Finally, PRL-1 mutants PRL-1(Y53A) and PRL-1(W68A), which are defective in binding p115 RhoGAP, were unable to activate ERK1/2 or RhoA (Fig. 5D). This indicates that physical interaction between PRL-1 and p115 RhoGAP is a prerequisite for PRL-1-mediated ERK1/2 and RhoA activation. In summary, starting from an unbiased screen for PRL-1 effectors, we have identified p115 RhoGAP as a bona fide PRL-1-binding protein. Biochemical and cellular studies suggested that the SH3 domain of p115 RhoGAP is required for its interaction with PRL-1. Structural analyses revealed that this interaction occurs via a novel protein-protein interaction whereby PRL-1 recognizes a conserved sequence motif in the canonical PxxP ligand-binding site of the SH3 domain in p115 RhoGAP. The interaction between PRL-1 and p115 RhoGAP coordinately activates the ERK1/2 pathway by displacing MEKK1 from p115 RhoGAP, and it activates RhoA by preventing its interaction with p115 RhoGAP. Our study not only offers a mechanistic explanation for ERK1/2 and RhoA activation by PRL-1 but also identifies a novel p115 RhoGAP-binding site in PRL-1 that can be used in the development of anticancer therapeutics by blocking the interaction between PRL-1 and p115 RhoGAP."
https://openalex.org/W1989120779,"Colonization of Helicobacter pylori in the acidic environment of the human stomach depends on the neutralizing activity of urease. Activation of apo-urease involves carboxylation of lysine 219 and insertion of two nickel ions. In H. pylori, this maturation process involves four urease accessory proteins as follows: UreE, UreF, UreG, and UreH. It is postulated that the apo-urease interacts with UreF, UreG, and UreH to form a pre-activation complex that undergoes GTP-dependent activation of urease. The crystal structure of the UreF-UreH complex reveals conformational changes in two distinct regions of UreF upon complex formation. First, the flexible C-terminal residues of UreF become ordered, forming an extra helix α10 and a loop structure stabilized by hydrogen bonds involving Arg-250. Second, the first turn of helix α2 uncoils to expose a conserved residue, Tyr-48. Substitution of R250A or Y48A in UreF abolishes the formation of the heterotrimeric complex of UreG-UreF-UreH and abolishes urease maturation. Our results suggest that the C-terminal residues and helix α2 of UreF are essential for the recruitment of UreG for the formation of the pre-activation complex. The molecular mass of the UreF-UreH complex determined by static light scattering was 116 ± 2.3 kDa, which is consistent with the quaternary structure of a dimer of heterodimers observed in the crystal structure. Taking advantage of the unique 2-fold symmetry observed in both the crystal structures of H. pylori urease and the UreF-UreH complex, we proposed a topology model of the pre-activation complex for urease maturation."

SmTK4 was the first Syk kinase identified in a parasite and found to be tissue-specifically transcribed in the gonads of adult Schistosoma mansoni. Functional analyses confirmed its role in oogenesis and spermatogenesis. As an SmTK4 upstream binding partner, the cellular protein-tyrosine kinase SmTK6 was isolated from a yeast two-hybrid library. Phylogenetic analyses performed in this study confirmed the first suggestions of a hybrid character of SmTK6. Biochemical studies made in Xenopus oocytes using inhibitors against Src (herbimycin A) and Abl (imatinib) kinases exhibited a biochemical inhibition profile of SmTK6, which was intermediate of Src and Abl kinases. As SmTK6 upstream interaction partners, we identified among others the known Src kinase SmTK3 and the Venus kinase receptor SmVKR1 of S. mansoni by yeast two-hybrid analyses, all of which co-localized in the gonads. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments confirmed interactions between SmTK6 and SmTK3 or SmVKR1. In Xenopus oocytes, it was finally shown that SmVKR1 but also SmTK3 were able to activate SmTK6 enzymatic activity indicating its functions in a receptor tyrosine kinase signal transduction cascade. These results not only demonstrate an intermediate but Src-biased profile of the unusual kinase SmTK6. They also strongly substantiate previous indications for a kinase complex, consisting of a receptor tyrosine kinase, Syk and Src kinases, which has been hypothesized to be involved in proliferation and differentiation processes in the gonads of schistosomes."

Using conditional genetic ablation, Bhat and co-workers demonstrated recently that NF186 is required for nodal assembly (14Thaxton C. Pillai A.M. Pribisko A.L. Dupree J.L. Bhat M.A. Neuron. 2011; 69: 244-257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Using combined dorsal root ganglia (DRG) neurons/SCs co-cultures from different knock-out animal models, Peles and co-workers found that NF186 is the single axonal partner of Gldn to ensure Nav clustering at nodes (1Feinberg K. Eshed-Eisenbach Y. Frechter S. Amor V. Salomon D. Sabanay H. Dupree J.L. Grumet M. Brophy P.J. Shrager P. Peles E. Neuron. 2010; 65: 490-502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Interestingly, NrCAM is only required in glial cells and not on the axonal side, to influence Gldn clustering. In Gldn-null mice, Nav clustering is affected during development at heminodes but not in mature nodes, even if SC microvilli are disorganized (1Feinberg K. Eshed-Eisenbach Y. Frechter S. Amor V.

Thus, it seems that NF186 may interact with other partners at the node that may compensate for the loss of Gldn or that paranodes may be sufficient to restrict Nav at mature nodes. At paranodes, the glial isoform of NF, NF155, influences the formation of septate-like junctions through its association with the axonal Caspr/Contactin complex (15Charles P. Tait S. Faivre-Sarrailh C. Barbin G. Gunn-Moore F. Denisenko-Nehrbass N. Guennoc A.M. Girault J.A. Brophy P.J. Lubetzki C. Curr.

Using different genetic models, several studies demonstrated the distinct roles of glial NF155 and neuronal NF186 in the formation of the paranodes and nodes, respectively (13Zonta B. Tait S.

These two isoforms contain distinct domains due to alternative splicing: i.e. NF186 encompasses a juxta-membrane mucin-like domain and NF155 an additional Fibronectin type III-like (FnIII) domain. However, the two NF splice variants both share the ability to bind multiple ligands including Gldn and Contactin. Therefore, it is of importance to determine whether NF utilizes distinct modules to organize and stabilize specific axonal subdomains of myelinated fibers. The mucin-like domain specific for NF186 is not implicated in Gldn binding, and no functional activity has been reported for this domain (19Koticha D. Maurel P. Zanazzi G. Kane-Goldsmith N. Basak S. Babiarz J. Salzer J. Grumet M. Dev. Biol. 2006; 293: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Recently, we showed that the Ig5–6 domains of NF bind Contactin and are required for the formation of paranodal junctions whereas they are dispensable for Gldn binding and nodal assembly (20Thaxton C.

In the present paper, we show that the FnIII domains of both NrCAM and NF186 are implicated in Gldn binding. Our data indicate that a module composed of FnIII domains 1 and 2 of NF186 mediates interaction with Gldn. Moreover, functional analysis using myelinating cultures of DRG neurons indicates that treatment with soluble FnIII domains of NF186 prevents the clustering of Gldn at heminodes, as observed with full-length NF186. The Contactin, Contactin-Fc, NF155-Fc, NrCAM-Fc, and GFP-tagged NrCAMΔFnIII (deletion of amino acids 608–998) constructs have been described previously (15Charles P. Tait S. Faivre-Sarrailh C.

Bennett (Duke University, Durham, NC), and NF186-Fc was from Dr. M. Grumet (Rutgers University, New Brunswick, NJ). Rat Gliomedin (NM_181382.2) was amplified by PCR from a rat sciatic nerve cDNA library and subcloned into pcDNA3 at KpnI-EcoRV sites with Myc epitope inserted at the C terminus. The HA-tagged NF186 deleted for the six Ig domains (amino acids 33–584; HA-NF186ΔIg), the Ig5–6 domains (amino acids 385–584; HA-NF186ΔIg5–6), the three FnIII domains (amino acids 613–894; HA-NF186ΔFnIII), and the Ig5–6 and FnIII domains (amino acids 385–894; HA-NF186ΔIg5–6ΔFnIII) were generated by QuikChange mutagenesis (Agilent Technologies). The FnIII domains-Fc construct (FnIII1,2,4-Fc) was generated by PCR amplification of the sequence coding for the signal peptide, HA tag, and FnIII domains and insertion in the HindIII-NheI sites of pIgPlus. The FnIII domains-Fc constructs deleted for FnIII1 or FnIII4 (FnIII2,4-Fc and FnIII1,2-Fc) were generated by QuikChange mutagenesis (deletion of amino acids 613–696 and 810–894, respectively). GFP-NrCAM in pEGFP-C1 was generated by PCR amplification of the four FnIII domains (amino acids 632–1022) of NrCAM12 and AgeI insertion in NrCAMΔFnIII. All mutant constructs were verified by sequencing (Beckman Coulter Genomics). The rabbit anti-Caspr antibody (antiserum SL51) was described previously (22Bonnon C. Bel C. Goutebroze L. Maigret B. Girault J.A. Faivre-Sarrailh C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2007; 18: 229-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The TRITC-conjugated goat anti-human Fc and the mouse anti-pan-Nav and mouse anti-Brevican mAbs were purchased from Sigma. The mouse anti-myelin associated glycoprotein (MAG) mAb was from Millipore. The rabbit anti-Gldn, the goat anti-GFP, and the rat anti-myelin basic protein (MBP) antibodies were from Abcam, and the rat anti-HA mAb was from Roche Diagnostics. The HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies were from Jackson ImmunoResearch and Alexa Fluor-conjugated secondary antibodies were from Invitrogen. N2a and HEK293 cells grown in DMEM containing 10% FCS (Invitrogen) were transiently transfected using jetPEI (Ozyme). Dissociated DRG neurons and SCs mixed cultures were prepared from embryonic day 16 Wistar rats. All animal procedures were carried out according to the animal care and experimentation committee rules approved by the CNRS. DRG were mechanically dissociated with 0.25% trypsin (Invitrogen) diluted in L-15 medium and plated at densities of 100,000 cells on Matrigel-coated 18-mm glass coverslips (BD Biosciences). Mixed cultures were maintained for 7 days in Neurobasal medium supplemented with 2% B-27, 1% penicillin-streptomycin, 0.3% glutamine (Invitrogen), and 100 ng/ml NGF (Euromedex). Myelin formation was induced by adding 50 μg/ml l-ascorbic acid (Euromedex) for an additional period of 10–18 days (23Eldridge C.F. Bunge M.B. Bunge R.P. Wood P.M. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 1023-1034Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). All the Fc chimera were purified from the supernatant of transfected HEK293 cells and used as described previously for binding experiments on transfected N2a cells (15Charles P. Tait S. Faivre-Sarrailh C. Barbin G. Gunn-Moore F. Denisenko-Nehrbass N. Guennoc A.M. Girault J.A. Brophy P.J. Lubetzki C. Curr.

Cell. 2007; 18: 229-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Fc binding was also performed on mixed cultures of DRG neurons and SCs 10–14 days after myelination induction. After washing and fixation with cold methanol, cells were incubated in blocking solution (5% normal donkey serum in PBS buffer) for 1 h and incubated with rabbit anti-Gldn antibody (1:100) or rat anti-HA (1:200) and then with secondary antibodies. After washing in PBS, cells were mounted in Mowiol (Calbiochem) and examined using an ApoTome AxioObserver Z1 inverted microscope under the control of Axiovision software (Carl Zeiss MicroImaging GmbH). Purified Fc-chimera (5 μg/ml) were added to DRG neurons/SCs mixed cultures at the time of myelin induction (day 7) and replenished every 2 days. After 14–18 days, cultures were fixed in cold methanol and immunostained for MAG and Gldn, or for MBP, Nav, Caspr, or Gldn. Confocal image acquisition was performed on a TCS SP2 laser-scanning microscope equipped with 63×/1.32 N.A. oil immersion objective (Leica Microsystems). Fluorescence images were collected automatically as frame-by-frame sequential series, with an average of three frame scans. Maximal projections of 10–15 Z-stacks were produced for image analysis. HEK293 cells transiently transfected with HA-NF186, HA-NF186ΔFnIII, HA-NF186ΔIg, GFP-NrCAM, or GFP-NrCAMΔFnIII, were homogenized on ice in lysis buffer containing 1% Nonidet P-40 and 1% Triton X-100 as described previously (15Charles P. Tait S. Faivre-Sarrailh C. Barbin G. Gunn-Moore F. Denisenko-Nehrbass N. Guennoc A.M. Girault J.A. Brophy P.J. Lubetzki C. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 217-220Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). NrCAM binding on Gldn-Fc was analyzed by pulldown assays using protein A-Sepharose as described previously (20Thaxton C. Pillai A.M. Pribisko A.L. Labasque M. Dupree J.L. Faivre-Sarrailh C. Bhat M.A. J. Neurosci. 2010; 30: 4868-4876Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). For NF186 binding assays, solubilized proteins (1.5 mg per condition) were incubated with Gldn-Fc-chimera (10–50 μg) covalently immobilized onto activated agarose beads using the Pierce co-immunoprecipitation kit (Thermo Scientific). Recombinant human Brevican (40 nm) (R&D Systems) was used for binding assays with Gldn-Fc, NF186-Fc, or NF186ΔFnIII-Fc linked to agarose beads. Inactivated agarose beads incubated with Gldn-Fc were used as negative control. Proteins retained by affinity were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. Immunodetection was performed with primary antibodies (anti-Gldn, 1:1,000; anti-HA, 1:1,000; anti-Fc, 1:1,000; anti-GFP, 1:1,000; anti-Brevican 1:1,000), HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:5,000), and chemiluminescence method (Roche Diagnostics) using ChemiGenius 2XE (Syngene). Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) was performed on a Biacore 3000 apparatus (GE Healthcare) at 25 °C with PBS as a running buffer. Purified Fc-chimeras were coupled to CM5 sensor chips using standard amine coupling chemistry (approximately 300–600 resonance units for NF186-Fc or NF186ΔFnIII-Fc, and 700–1200 resonance units for NrCAM-Fc and FnIII1,2,4-Fc). The first flow cell was subjected to the chemical step of coupling to serve as an internal control. Alternatively, Fc alone was coupled to the sensor chip as a negative control. The single-cycle kinetic method was used to measure the affinity of Gldn with Ig-CAMs as described previously (24Marquèze-Pouey B. Martin-Moutot N. Sakkou-Norton M. Lévêque C. Ji Y. Cornet V. Hsiao W.L. Seagar M. Traffic. 2008; 9: 1088-1100Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Gldn-Fc was serially diluted 2-fold in running buffer yielding concentrations ranging from 2.5 to 40 nm and samples injected sequentially at 30 μl/min in increasing concentrations over both the ligand and the reference surfaces. Injections were carried out using Kinject command with an association time of 120 s and a dissociation time of 60 s except for the last injection where the dissociation time was extended to 10 min. Blank run injections of PBS were performed in the same conditions before Gldn-Fc injections. Subtracted sensorgrams were globally fitted with the 1:1 titration kinetic binding model from Biaevaluation 4.1 software. Previous studies demonstrated that the olfactomedin domain of Gldn mediates its interaction with NF and NrCAM (7Eshed Y. Feinberg K. Poliak S. Sabanay H. Sarig-Nadir O. Spiegel I. Bermingham Jr., J.R. Peles E. Neuron. 2005; 47: 215-229Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 8Eshed Y. Feinberg K. Carey D.J. Peles E. J. Cell Biol. 2007; 177: 551-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). To dissect the basis for Ig-CAMs/Gldn association further, we investigated whether the Ig or FnIII domains of NrCAM and NF may be critical for these interactions. HEK293 cells were transfected with GFP-NrCAM or GFP-NrCAMΔFnIII, which is deleted of the four FnIII domains. Cell extracts (Fig. 1A, Input) were incubated with Gldn-Fc immobilized onto protein A-Sepharose beads. GFP-NrCAM strongly precipitated with Gldn-Fc and not with Fc used as negative control (Fig. 1A). In contrast, GFP-NrCAMΔFnIII did not precipitate with Gldn-Fc (Fig. 1A). Next, Gldn-Fc binding assays were performed on N2a cells transiently transfected with GFP-NrCAM or GFP-NrCAMΔFnIII (Fig. 1B). NrCAM surface expression was not modified by deletion of FnIII repeats as illustrated in Fig. 1, B and C, showing the fluorescence for GFP. Gldn-Fc strongly bound N2a cells transfected with GFP-NrCAM but not with GFP-NrCAMΔFnIII (Fig. 1B) in agreement with the results obtained in pulldown experiments. In contrast, deletion of FnIII domains of NrCAM had no effect on its association with Contactin (Fig. 1C). We then assessed whether the FnIII domains of NF186 may be implicated in its interaction with Gldn, as we observed for NrCAM. Recently, we showed that the Ig5–6 domains are not required for the interaction between NF186 and Gldn (20Thaxton C. Pillai A.M. Pribisko A.L. Labasque M. Dupree J.L. Faivre-Sarrailh C. Bhat M.A. J. Neurosci. 2010; 30: 4868-4876Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). We generated mutant forms of NF186 with either deletion of the three FnIII domains (HA-NF186ΔFnIII) or deletion of the six Ig domains (HA-NF186ΔIg). HA-NF186, HA-NF186ΔFnIII, and HA-NF186ΔIg were detected on immunoblots with an apparent molecular mass higher than the predicted one, likely due to glycosylation (Fig. 2A, Input). We performed pulldown assays by incubating extracts from HEK293 cells transfected with the different forms of NF186 with Gldn-Fc covalently immobilized onto activated agarose beads. Inactivated agarose beads incubated with Gldn-Fc were used as control (Fig. 2A, CTL). As shown in Fig. 2A, HA-NF186 precipitated with Gldn-Fc (lane 2) and not with control agarose beads (lane 1). Both HA-NF186ΔFnIII (lane 3) and HA-NF186ΔIg (lane 4) precipitated with Gldn-Fc. HA-NF186ΔFnIII precipitated with Gldn-Fc was detected as a doublet (lane 3). The lower band indicated with an asterisk was strongly enriched in the precipitate compared with total extract and may result from proteolytic cleavage (25Volkmer H. Hassel B. Wolff J.M. Frank R. Rathjen F.G. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 149-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The mucin-like domain is not implicated in Gldn binding (7Eshed Y. Feinberg K. Poliak S. Sabanay H. Sarig-Nadir O. Spiegel I. Bermingham Jr., J.R. Peles E. Neuron. 2005; 47: 215-229Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 19Koticha D. Maurel P. Zanazzi G.

Faivre-Sarrailh C. Bhat M.A. J. Neurosci. 2010; 30: 4868-4876Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Thus, we can hypothesize that two binding sites may be involved in interaction with Gldn in regard to pulldown experiments, one involving the FnIII repeats and the other the Ig domains. By comparison with NrCAM in which the FnIII repeats were required for Gldn binding, it seems that NF186 may bind Gldn in a more complex way. Because the proteoglycan Brevican has been described to bind NF186, but not NrCAM (26Hedstrom K.L. Xu X. Ogawa Y. Frischknecht R. Seidenbecher C.I. Shrager P. Rasband M.N. J. Cell Biol. 2007; 178: 875-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar), it might be implicated in mediating complex association between NF186 and Gldn. We used recombinant human Brevican (40 nm) in pulldown experiments with Fc-chimeras (Fig. 2B). Brevican was precipitated with beads covalently linked with Gldn-Fc (lane 2), NF186-Fc (lane 3), and NF186ΔFnIII-Fc (lane 4) but not with control beads (lane 1). However, we were not able to detect Brevican in HEK293 cell extracts suggesting that other proteoglycans might be implicated. As a complementary approach, Gldn-Fc binding assays were performed on N2a cells transiently transfected with HA-NF186, HA-NF186ΔFnIII, or HA-NF186ΔIg (Fig. 2D). All NF186 mutants were detected at the cell surface as illustrated in Fig. 2C by immunofluorescence staining of the extracellular HA epitope. Gldn-Fc strongly bound N2a cells transfected with either HA-NF186 or HA-NF186ΔIg. In contrast, Gldn-Fc did not bind cells expressing NF186ΔFnIII by opposition with observations made in pulldown experiments (Fig. 2D). Deletion of the FnIII domains of NF186 should not affect its interaction with Contactin, which only requires the Ig domains (27Volkmer H. Zacharias U. Nörenberg U. Rathjen F.G. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 1083-1093Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). As expected, Contactin-Fc strongly bound N2a cells expressing HA-NF186ΔFnIII and did not bind cells expressing HA-NF186ΔIg (Fig. 2E). In addition, we performed binding assays using NrCAM-Fc on N2a cells transfected with HA-NF186 constructs. NrCAM-Fc strongly bound to NF186 (Fig. 3) as reported in Lustig et al. (6Lustig M. Zanazzi G. Sakurai T. Blanco C. Levinson S.R. Lambert S. Grumet M. Salzer J.L. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 1864-1869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Previous studies in the chick indicated that NrCAM interacts with NF via its Ig domains (28Volkmer H. Leuschner R. Zacharias U. Rathjen F.G. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1059-1069Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). To map the modules of interaction in the rat, we analyzed NrCAM-Fc binding on HA-NF186 deleted from the six Ig, the Ig5–6 or the Ig5–6, and FnIII domains. All of the constructs were detected at the cell surface of N2a transfected cells using anti-HA immunostaining (Fig. 3). Deletion of the Ig5–6 and FnIII domains of NF186 had no effect whereas total deletion of the Ig domains prevented NrCAM-Fc binding (Fig. 3). Thus, we mapped the Ig1–4 domains of NF186 as implicated in its interaction with NrCAM. To determine whether FnIII domains may be not only critical, but sufficient for interaction with Gldn, we generated Fc fusion proteins for the ectodomain of NF186 (NF186-Fc), the ectodomain of NF186 deleted for the FnIII domains (NF186ΔFnIII-Fc), and a Fc fusion only containing the three FnIII domains of NF186 (FnIII1,2,4-Fc). All NF186-Fc fusion proteins produced in HEK293 cell supernatant were detected by immunoblotting with an apparent molecular mass higher than expected due to N-glycosylation (Fig. 4A). As illustrated in Fig. 4B, FnIII1,2,4-Fc protein strongly bound N2a cells expressing the transmembrane form of Gldn as did NF186-Fc. The FnIII1,2,4-Fc did not bind N2a cells expressing Contactin (Fig. 4C). This result indicates that the FnIII domains of NF186 are sufficient for Gldn binding. In contrast, NF186ΔFnIII-Fc was unable to bind Gldn expressed on N2a cell surface (Fig. 4B) whereas it bound Contactin (Fig. 4C). To precisely define the modules of NF186 implicated in Gldn interaction, we generated Fc proteins fused with FnIII1,2 or FnIII2,4 domains. Deletion of FnIII1 abolished binding on Gldn-expressing N2a cells, whereas deletion of FnIII4 had no effect (Fig. 4B). Thus, the FnIII domains 1 and 2 of NF186 are sufficient for Gldn binding. The direct interaction of the FnIII domains of NF186 with Gldn was confirmed by SPR experiments. As shown in Fig. 5A, Gldn-Fc bound to FnIII1,2,4-Fc and NF186-Fc immobilized on the sensor chip but not to NF186ΔFnIII-Fc. No interaction was revealed even at high concentration of Gldn-Fc (800 nm) over immobilized NF186ΔFnIII-Fc (data not shown), in accordance with our observations in cell binding assays. The affinity of NF186 and FnIII domain recombinant proteins was measured by injecting increasing concentrations of Gldn-Fc over immobilized NF186-Fc or FnIII1,2,4-Fc (Fig. 5B). Binding analysis indicated that NF186-Fc and FnIII1,2,4-Fc strongly associated with Gldn-Fc with an apparent affinity constant (KD) of 5.7 ± 0.8 nm (kon = 1.2 ± 0.3 × 105 m−1 s−1, koff = 7.2 ± 2.7 × 10−4 s−1) and 2.2 ± 1 nm (kon = 1 ± 0.1 × 105 m−1 s−1, koff = 2.2 ± 1.4 × 10−4 s−1), respectively (n = 3, Fig. 5B). Altogether, these data indicate that the in vitro interaction of NF186 with Gldn is mediated by its FnIII domains. Next, we compared the binding affinity of NF186 and NrCAM for Gldn. NrCAM-Fc associated with Gldn-Fc with a KD of 0.9 ± 0.3 nm (kon = 3 ± 0.8 × 105 m−1 s−1, koff = 3.1 ± 1.6 × 10−4 s−1) (n = 3, Fig. 5B). Thus, NF186-Fc and NrCAM-Fc affinities for Gldn-Fc are in the low nanomolar range with NrCAM-Fc exhibiting a six times greater affinity than NF186-Fc. To assess the functional relevance of the interaction between the FnIII domains of NF186 and Gldn, we"

Morphological analyses of the bones in most of the patients have revealed the mixed bone lesions, comprising both osteolytic and osteoblastic elements. β-Catenin plays a key role in both embryonic skeletogenesis and postnatal bone regeneration. Although this pathway is also involved in many bone malignancy, such as osteosarcoma and prostate cancer-induced bone metastases, its regulation of breast cancer bone metastases remains unknown. Here, we provide evidence that the β-catenin signaling pathway has a significant impact on the bone lesion phenotype. In this study, we established a novel mouse model of mixed bone lesions using intratibial injection of TM40D-MB cells, a breast cancer cell line that is highly metastatic to bone. We found that both upstream and downstream molecules of the β-catenin pathway are up-regulated in TM40D-MB cells compared with non-bone metastatic TM40D cells. TM40D-MB cells also have a higher T cell factor (TCF) reporter activity than TM40D cells. Inactivation of β-catenin in TM40D-MB cells through expression of a dominant negative TCF4 not only increases osteoclast differentiation in a tumor-bone co-culture system and enhances osteolytic bone destruction in mice, but also inhibits osteoblast differentiation. Surprisingly, although tumor cells overexpressing β-catenin did induce a slight increase of osteoblast differentiation in vitro, these cells display a minimal effect on osteoblastic bone formation in mice. These data collectively demonstrate that β-catenin acts as an important determinant in mixed bone lesions, especially in controlling osteoblastic effect within tumor-harboring bone environment."
https://openalex.org/W2073089207,"Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator-1α (PGC-1α) is a transcriptional coactivator that contributes to the regulation of numerous transcriptional programs including the hepatic response to fasting. Mechanisms at transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels allow PGC-1α to support distinct biological pathways. Here we describe a novel human liver-specific PGC-1α transcript that results from alternative promoter usage and is induced by FOXO1 as well as glucocorticoids and cAMP-response element-binding protein signaling but is not present in other mammals. Hepatic tissue levels of novel and wild-type transcripts were similar but were only moderately associated (p < 0.003). Novel mRNA levels were associated with a polymorphism located in its promoter region, whereas wild-type transcript levels were not. Furthermore, hepatic PCK1 mRNA levels exhibited stronger associations with the novel than with the wild-type transcript levels. Except for a deletion of 127 amino acids at the N terminus, the protein, termed L-PGC-1α, is identical to PGC-1α. L-PGC-1α was localized in the nucleus and showed coactivation properties that overlap with those of PGC-1α. Collectively, our data support a role of L-PGC-1α in gluconeogenesis, but functional differences predicted from the altered structure suggest that L-PGC-1α may have arisen to adapt PGC-1α to more complex metabolic pathways in humans. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator-1α (PGC-1α) is a transcriptional coactivator that contributes to the regulation of numerous transcriptional programs including the hepatic response to fasting. Mechanisms at transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels allow PGC-1α to support distinct biological pathways. Here we describe a novel human liver-specific PGC-1α transcript that results from alternative promoter usage and is induced by FOXO1 as well as glucocorticoids and cAMP-response element-binding protein signaling but is not present in other mammals.

Matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) represents one of the most prominent proteinases associated with inflammation and tumorigenesis. The recently identified human transcription factor sLZIP is a member of the leucine zipper transcription factor family. Although sLZIP is known to function in ligand-induced transactivation of the glucocorticoid receptor, its exact functions and target genes are not known. In this study, we investigated the role of sLZIP in MMP-9 expression and its involvement in cervical cancer development. Our results show that sLZIP increased the expression of MMP-9 at both the mRNA and protein levels and the proteolytic activity of MMP-9 in HeLa and SiHa cells. sLZIP also increased the transcriptional activity of MMP-9 by binding directly to the cAMP-responsive element of the MMP-9 promoter region. Involvement of sLZIP in MMP-9 expression was further supported by the fact that ME-180 cells expressing sLZIP siRNA were refractory to MMP-9 expression. Results from wound healing and invasion assays showed that sLZIP enhanced both the migration and invasion of cervical cancer cells. The increased migration and invasion of HeLa and SiHa cells that were induced by sLZIP were abrogated by inhibition of the proteolytic activity of MMP-9. These results indicate that sLZIP plays a critical role in MMP-9 expression and is probably involved in invasion and metastasis of cervical cancer.

https://openalex.org/W2124266810,"A diverse range of organisms utilize neurotoxins that target specific ion channels and modulate their activity. Typically, toxins are clustered into several multigene families, providing an organism with the upper hand in the never-ending predator-prey arms race. Several gene families, including those encoding certain neurotoxins, have been subject to diversifying selection forces, resulting in rapid gene evolution. Here we sought a spatial pattern in the distribution of both diversifying and purifying selection forces common to neurotoxin gene families. Utilizing the mechanistic empirical combination model, we analyzed various toxin families from different phyla affecting various receptors and relying on diverse modes of action. Through this approach, we were able to detect clear correlations between the pharmacological surface of a toxin and rapidly evolving domains, rich in positively selected residues. On the other hand, patches of negatively selected residues were restricted to the nontoxic face of the molecule and most likely help in stabilizing the tertiary structure of the toxin. We thus propose a mutual evolutionary strategy of venomous animals in which adaptive molecular evolution is directed toward the toxin active surface. Furthermore, we propose that the binding domains of unstudied toxins could be readily predicted using evolutionary considerations."
https://openalex.org/W2092815850,"Ovarian folliculogenesis has been studied as a model of hormonal regulation of development and differentiation, cell death, and cell-cell communication. In addition to gonadotropins from the pituitary and follicular paracrine factors, oocyte secreted factors have been shown to play critical roles in the regulation of follicular cell functions. Except for the well characterized BMP family proteins, including GDF9 and BMP15, oocytes are known to secrete oocyte secreted factors that are important for the regulation of cumulus cell survival and the maintenance of tertiary structure of cumulus cell-enclosed oocyte complexes (COCs). Based on genomic screening and studies of COCs cultured in vitro, we showed that intermedin (IMD)/adrenomedullin 2 (ADM2) is a novel oocyte-derived ligand important for the regulation of cell interactions in COCs that functions, in part, by suppressing cumulus cell apoptosis. Consistently, we showed that suppression of IMD/ADM2 signaling in growing rat ovaries in vivo leads to oocyte atresia and aberrant cell cycle progression in follicular cells. Together, our studies indicated that mammalian oocytes deploy a G protein-coupled receptor ligand to coordinate normal interactions of oocytes and cumulus cells and provided a better understanding of how the tertiary structure of a COC is maintained as follicles undergo exponential growth during the late stages of folliculogenesis."

Our previous research suggested the Bombyx AKH receptor is activated by AKH1 and AKH2 with high affinity but by AKH3 with quite low affinity. In this study, using stable functional expression of the receptors in HEK293 cells, we have now identified AKH3 as a specific ligand for two orphan G-protein-coupled receptors, and we therefore named them AKHR2a and AKHR2b, respectively. We demonstrated that both AKHR2a and AKHR2b were activated by AKH3 at high affinity and by AKH1 and AKH2 at low affinity, leading to an increase of intracellular cAMP levels and activation of ERK1/2 and receptor internalization, but they were not activated by Bombyx corazonin. Conversely, the Bombyx corazonin receptor was activated by corazonin but not by AKH1–3. Quantitative RT-PCR revealed that AKHR2a and AKHR2b were both highly expressed in the testis but were also detected at low levels in other tissues.

AKHs are initially known to mobilize carbohydrates and lipids during energy-expensive activities like long distance flight. Recent studies have highlighted the critical role of AKH in modulating fundamental physiological processes, such as sugar homeostasis, lipid metabolism, and reproduction (6Michitsch J. Steele J.E.

Batley K.E. Morris H.R. Nature. 1976; 263: 207-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). AKH structurally consists of 8–10 amino acids with a pyroglutamate at the N terminus and an amidated C terminus. The first cDNA encoding AKH precursor in Lepidoptera has been cloned from Manduca (9Bradfield J.Y. Keeley L.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 12791-12793Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).

The physiological function of AKH peptides is mediated via adipokinetic hormone receptor (AKHR), a typical G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR), that was first identified from the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster and the silkworm B. mori (13Staubli F. Jorgensen T.J. Cazzamali G. Williamson M. Lenz C. Sondergaard L. Roepstorff P. Grimmelikhuijzen C.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 3446-3451Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar) and then from the cockroach Periplaneta americana (14Hansen K.K. Hauser F. Cazzamali G. Williamson M. Grimmelikhuijzen C.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 343: 638-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) and African malaria mosquito Anopheles gambiae (15Belmont M. Cazzamali G. Williamson M. Hauser F. Grimmelikhuijzen C.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 344: 160-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Previous biochemical characterization with isolated fat body suggested that AKH binds to its receptor and activates adenylyl cyclase via the Gs protein, which results in an increase of intracellular cAMP levels. In addition, AKH activates phospholipase C to induce the release of Ca2+ from intracellular Ca2+ stores (16Vroemen S.F. Van Marrewijk W.J. Van der Horst D.J. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1995; 107: 165-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 17Vroemen S.F. Van der Horst D.J. Van Marrewijk W.J. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1998; 141: 7-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Our previous studies have demonstrated that AKH stimulation not only led to a ligand concentration-dependent mobilization of intracellular Ca2+ and cAMP accumulation but also elicited PKA and PKC pathway-mediated transient activation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) pathways in HEK293 cells stably expressing AKHR (18Huang H. He X. Deng X. Li G. Ying G. Sun Y. Shi L. Benovic J.L. Zhou N. Biochemistry. 2010; 49: 10862-10872Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). We have further demonstrated that AKH2 exhibits comparable activities in intracellular cAMP accumulation to AKH1, but Bombyx AKH3 was much less effective in activating Bombyx AKHR, strongly implying that there is more likely other intrinsic AKHRs that exist as a high affinity receptor for AKH3 in Bombyx (19Zhu C.

By genomic data mining and phylogenetic analysis, Bombyx neuropeptide GPCR A28 and A29 (BNGR-A28 and -A29) have been identified as adipokinetic hormone-like receptors in Bombyx (20Yamanaka N.

Therefore, in this study, we report on the cloning of cDNAs encoding the putative adipokinetic hormone-like receptors BNGR-A28 and BNGR-A29 from the silkworm B. mori and functional expression of both receptors in HEK293 cells. Further characterization in signaling and internalization by comparing with a known Bombyx AKH receptor and a putative Bombyx corazonin receptor led us to conclude that the orphan receptors BNGR-A28 and BNGR-A29 are specific receptors for Bombyx AKH3. Our findings provide a foundation for future studies of AKH3 and its receptors in physiological processes. Cell culture media and fetal bovine serum (FBS) was bought from Hyclone (Beijing, China). G418 and Lipofectamine2000 were purchased from Invitrogen. The pEGFP-N1 and pCMV-FLAG vectors were purchased from Clontech and Sigma, respectively. RIPA lysis buffer were obtained from Beyotime (Haimen, China). Anti-phospho-ERK1/2 (Thr-202/Tyr-204) and ERK1/2 antibodies and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody were bought from Cell Signaling Technology (Danvers, MA). To construct the Bombyx AKHR plasmid, RT-PCR was performed as described previously (19Zhu C. Huang H. Hua R. Li G. Yang D. Luo J. Zhang C. Shi L. Benovic J.L. Zhou N. FEBS Lett. 2009; 583: 1463-1468Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). For RT-PCR, total RNA was isolated from testes and brains using TRIzol reagent (TAKARA), and cDNA was synthesized using a kit from TAKARA. To amplify the full-length sequence encoding BNGR-A28 (A28), BNGR-A29 (A29), and the corazonin receptor (BNGR-A21 and A21), two pairs of primers for each receptor were designed based on the sequence of GenBankTM accession numbers AB330449, AB330450, and AB330442 and are as follows. The coding sequence of the A28 was amplified for pCMV-FLAG vector using the sense primer 5′-AAGCTTATGGATGAATCGACGCAAATGGAT-3′ and the antisense primer 5′-GGATCCCTAAGCGGAATACCATTTTTTTGG-3′. The coding sequence of the A29 was amplified for pCMV-FLAG vector using the sense primer 5′-AAGCTTATGAAAATGGTGAATTTGATTTC-3′ and the antisense primer 5′-GGATCCTCAGGCGGGCCCGCGTGGCGCCCT-3′; another pair of primers were also designed for pEGFP-N1, sense primer 5′-AAGCTTGCCACCATGAAAATGGTGAATTTGAATTTC-3′ and antisense primer 5′-GGATCCCGGGCGGGCCCGCGTGGCGCCCT-3′. The coding sequence of the A21 was amplified for pCMV-FLAG vector using the sense primer 5′-AAGCTTATGGACAACGAAGGCAACAGTAC-3′ and the antisense primer 5′-GGATCCTTATAACAAACTAATGTTCTGTCCAT-3′; and a pair of primers were also designed for pEGFP-N1, sense primer 5′-AAGCTTGCCACCATGGACAACGAAGGCAACAGTAC-3′ and antisense primer 5′-GGATCCCGTAACAAACTAATGTTCTGTCCATTCG-3′. The corresponding PCR products were cloned into pMD19-T (Invitrogen) using the TA cloning kit (TAKARA), followed by subcloning into the pCMV-FLAG and pEGFP-N1 expression vectors, respectively, using the rapid DNA ligation kit (Beyotime), and we named these vectors as FLAG-A28, FLAG-A29, FLAG-A21, A29-EGFP, and A21-EGFP, respectively. All constructs were sequenced to verify the correct sequences, orientations, and reading frame. The human embryonic kidney cell line (HEK293) was maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM, Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Hyclone) and 4 mm l-glutamine (Invitrogen). The AKHR, A28, A29, and corazonin receptor cDNA plasmid constructs were transfected or co-transfected into HEK293 cells using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. 1–2 days after transfection, selection for stable expression was initiated by the addition of G418 (800 μg/ml). Approximately 2 × 105 cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 0.5% BSA (FACS buffer) and incubated with 10 μg/ml FITC-labeled anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody (Sigma) in a total volume of 100 μl. After incubating for 60 min at 4 °C, the cells were pelleted and washed three times in FACS buffer. The cells were then fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde in FACS buffer and subjected to flow cytometry analysis on a FACScan flow cytometer (Coulter EPICS Elite, Coolten Corp., Hialeah, FL). After seeding in a 48-well plate overnight, HEK293 cells transiently or stably co-transfected with FLAG receptor (AKHR, A28, A29, or A21) and pCRE-Luc were grown to 90–95% confluence, stimulated with the indicated concentration of AKHs and corazonin peptides in DMEM without FBS, and incubated for 4–6 h at 37 °C. Luciferase activity was detected by use of a firefly luciferase assay kit (Kenreal, Shanghai, China). The HEK293 cells transiently or stably expressing FLAG receptor were seeded in 24-well plates and starved for 60 min in serum-free medium to reduce background ERK1/2 activation and eliminate the effects due to change of medium. After stimulation with the agonist, cells were lysed by RIPA buffer (Beyotime). Equal amounts of total cell lysate were size-fractionated by SDS-PAGE (10–12%) and transferred to a PVDF membrane (Millipore). Membranes were blocked in blocking buffer (TBS containing 0.05–0.1% Tween 20 and 5% nonfat dry milk) for 1 h at room temperature and then incubated with rabbit monoclonal anti-pERK1/2 antibody (Cell Signaling) and anti-rabbit HRP-conjugated secondary antibody (Cell Signaling) according to the manufacturers' protocols. Total ERK1/2 (Cell Signaling) was assessed as a loading control after p-ERK1/2 chemiluminescence detection using an HRP substrate purchased from Cell Signaling (catalog no. 7003). For receptor surface expression analysis and internalization assay, HEK293 cells transiently or stably expressing receptor-EGFP were seeded onto glass coverslips coated with 0.1 mg/ml of poly-l-lysine and allowed to attach overnight under normal growth conditions. After treatment with AKH peptides or corazonin peptide at 37 °C for 60 min, the cells were fixed with 2–4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min at room temperature. The cells were mounted in mounting reagent (Beyotime) and visualized by fluorescence microscopy on a Zeiss LSM510 laser-scanning confocal microscope attached to a Zeiss Axiovert 200 microscope using a Zeiss Plan-Apo 63 × 1.40 NA oil immersion lens. HEK293 cells stably transfected with the pCMV-BNGR-A28 or pCMV-BNGR-A29 construct were seeded in 48-well dishes coated with poly-l-lysine. The next day, the cells were stimulated with the indicated concentrations of the agonist for the indicated times. Medium was aspirated, and the cells were washed once with Tris-buffered saline (TBS). After fixing the cells for 5 min at room temperature with 3.7% formaldehyde in TBS, the cells were washed three times with TBS and then blocked for 45 min with 1% bovine serum albumin/TBS. Cells were then incubated for 1 h with an alkaline phosphatase-conjugated monoclonal antibody directed against the FLAG epitope and diluted 1:1,000. Cells were washed three times, and antibody binding was visualized by adding 0.25 ml of an alkaline phosphatase substrate (Bio-Rad). Development was stopped by adding 0.1 ml of the substrate to a 96-well microtiter plate containing 0.1 ml of 0.4 m NaOH. Plates were read at 405 nm in a microplate reader (Bio-Rad) using Microplate Manager software. For the β-arrestin translocation assays, the HEK293 cells were transfected with the β-arrestin2-GFP and the corresponding FLAG receptor constructs (AKHR, A28, A29, or A21). One day after transfection, the cells were seeded onto glass coverslips and allowed to recover for 24–36 h in a 6-well plate. The cells were incubated with 2 ml of DMEM without FBS, and if necessary, the corresponding ligands were added to stimulate the receptors for 15 min and examined using a Zeiss laser scanning confocal microscope. Quantitative RT-PCR was performed as described previously, with slight modifications (20Yamanaka N. Yamamoto S. Zitnan D. Watanabe K. Kawada T. Satake H. Kaneko Y. Hiruma K. Tanaka Y. Shinoda T. Kataoka H. PLoS One. 2008; 3e3048Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Total RNA was extracted from tissue samples as detailed in the manufacturer's protocol (Qiagen). Reverse transcription was completed using PrimeScript first strand cDNA synthesis kit (Takara). cDNA from samples was quantified on a 7500 real time PCR machine (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) instrument using SYBR Premix Ex Taq (Takara). The following A28 and A29 receptors and actin primers were used as reported previously. The possibility of genomic DNA contamination was excluded by DNase treatment and by measurement of actin levels in RNA samples (which were not reversing transcribed). Differential expression of the cell lines was compared using the ΔΔCT method. The AKH peptides were prepared by solid-phase synthesis using the Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) strategy on a 430A peptide synthesizer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) and a 9050 Pepsynthesizer Plus (Perceptive Biosystems, Cambridge, MA). Crude peptides were purified by preparative reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography using a Dynamax-300 Å C18 25-cm × 21.4-mm inner diameter column with a flow rate of 9 ml/min and two solvent systems of 0.1% TFA/H2O and 0.1% TFA/acetonitrile. Fractions containing the appropriate peptide were pooled together and lyophilized. The purity of the final product was assessed by analytical reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography, capillary electrophoresis, and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. All results are expressed as the mean ± S.E. of n. Data were analyzed using nonlinear curve fitting (GraphPad PRISM version 5.0) to obtain pEC50 values. Statistical significance was determined using Student's t test. Probability values less than or equal to 0.05 were considered. Three distinct cDNAs encoding the prepro-Bombyx AKH1–3 have been identified (11Roller L. Yamanaka N. Watanabe K. Daubnerová I. Zitnan D. Kataoka H. Tanaka Y. Insect Biochem. Mol.

The predicted genes of BNGR-A28 (GenBankTM accession number AB330449) and -A29 (GenBankTM accession number AB330450) were cloned by RT-PCR from brain and testis of silkworm larva, respectively. As shown in Fig. 1A, the open reading frames (ORFs) of BNGR-A28 and -A29 encode protein of 418 and 416 amino acids, which share 30.2 and 30.8% identical amino acid residues in common with the known Bombyx AKHR, respectively. We then stably expressed BNGR-A28 and -A29 in human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293), and static significant cell surface expression was detected by FACS analysis and fluorescent microscopy observation, although the cell surface expression level of BNGR-A28 and -A29 was much lower than AKHR (Fig. 1, B and C). To detect whether AKHs can bind to BNGR-A28 and -A29 and trigger a second messenger-cAMP signaling pathway, HEK293 cells stably co-transfected with A28 or A29 receptor and a reporter gene system consisting of the firefly luciferase coding region under control of a minimal promoter containing cAMP-response elements (CRE) were created. As shown in Fig. 2, D–F, upon stimulation with AKHs, both BNGR-A28 and -A29 were activated to induce accumulation of intracellular cAMP by AKH3 with high affinity and with EC50 values of (9.9 ± 0.7) × 10−10 m and (4.48 ± 1.03) × 10−9 m, respectively, but AKH1 and AKH2 within a range of high concentration (>μm). Conversely, the known AKHR was activated by a low concentration of both AKH1 and AKH2 and by AKH3 with a much lower potency. As a control, no change in the cAMP level was detected in parental HEK293 cells (Fig. 2A). In addition, preincubation with 100 ng/ml pertussis toxin overnight was found to have no effect on cAMP production in BNGR-A28 (Fig. 2B) and BNGR-A29-expressing cells (Fig. 2C), whereas stimulation with cholera toxin led to a remarkable increase in the cellular levels of cAMP in response to AKH3. Taken together, these results suggest that activated BNGR-A28 and -A29 receptors are coupled to Gs-type G-protein and thereby stimulate adenylyl cyclase, leading to accumulation of intracellular cAMP. It has been well established that ERK1/2 have emerged as important effectors for GPCRs and can be used to assess the functional outcome of receptor stimulation (22Pierce K.L. Luttrell L.M.

Next, we assessed AKH-mediated activation of ERK1/2 in HEK293 cells stably expressing BNGR-A28 or -A29 using a phospho-specific antibody known to bind only to the phosphorylated (Thr-202 and Tyr-204 of ERK1 and Thr-185 and Tyr-187 of ERK2) and activated forms of these kinases (24Chen Z.

As indicated in Fig. 3, stimulation with AKH3 elicited transient phosphorylation kinetics of ERK1/2 with maximal phosphorylation evident at 5 min in BNGR-A28 or -A29 transfected cells, although AKH3 treatment did not provoke any appreciable effects on ERK1/2 in the parental 293 cells or transiently mock-transfected 293 cells. A dose-response curve showed that the response to AKH3 had an EC50 value of (6.1 ± 1.3) × 10−10 m for BNGR-A28 and (1.7 ± 0.34) × 10−9 m for BNGR-A29. AKH1 and AKH2 were also found to activate BNGR-A28 or -A29-mediated ERK1/2 activation in a range of higher concentrations than 100 nm (Fig. 4), consistent with the observation of intracellular cAMP formation. In addition, to elucidate the signaling pathways involved in activation of ERK1/2, HEK293 cells stably transfected with A28 or A29 receptor were treated with different inhibitors. We demonstrated that BNGR-A28- or BNGR-A29-mediated activation of ERK1/2 was significantly blocked by MEK inhibitor U0126 (100 nm), PKA inhibitor H89 (10 μm), and PKC inhibitors Go6983 (1 μm) and GF109203X (1 μm) but not by EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor AG1478 (1 μm), PI3K inhibitor wortmannin (1 μm), and Src family tyrosine kinase inhibitor PP2 (10 μm), suggesting that both BNGR-A28 and BNGR-A29 activate ERK1/2 via PKA- and PKC-dependent but EGFR-, SRC-, and PI3K-independent pathways (Fig. 5).FIGURE 4AKH1 and AKH2 also involved in activation of MAPK pathway in BNGR-A28- and -A29-expressing cells. ERK1/2 phosphorylation in HEK293 cells stably expressing FLAG-AKHR (A), FLAG-A28 (B), or FLAG-A29 (C) was detected in response to different doses of AKH1, AKH2, and AKH3 for 5 min; the results shown represent three independent experiments.

Lefkowitz R.J. Biochem. J. 2003; 375: 503-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). To visualize the receptor internalization, we constructed expression of BNGR-A29 fused with enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) at the C-terminal end. As shown in Fig. 6, the fluorescence of A29-EGFP was mainly localized in the plasma membrane and was dramatically internalized in response to AKH3. Observation with confocal microscopy revealed that treatment with high concentrations of AKH1 (>1 μm) resulted in internalization of A29-EGFP to a remarkable degree, although no significant endocytosis for A28 receptor was observed, if any, upon AKH2 stimulation with high concentrations (Fig. 6B). This is in agreement with our observation that the AKH3 peptide could induce internalization of the known AKHR at the higher concentration of 10 μm (Fig. 6A). Internalization of A28 and A29 stimulated by different concentrations of AKH3 was quantified by ELISA experiments (Fig. 6C). Moreover, Fig. 6D showed that in the presence of AKH3 and AKH1, β-arrestin2-GFP was significantly translocated to the plasma membrane, whereas only a small amount of AKH2 was recruited to the plasma membrane in cells expressing BNGR-A28 or -A29 receptors, confirming that AKH3 is the major agonist for both BNGR-A28 and -A29, and cross-functional responses are observed among AKHR, BNGR-A28, or -A29 receptors. To confirm the role of β-arrestins in the regulation of receptor internalization, we also used specific siRNAs to knock down the expression of β-arrestin1 and β-arrestin2 in BNGR-A29-EGFP expressing HEK293 cells. Silencing β-arrestin2 effectively inhibited the internalization of BNGR-A29, whereas knockdown of β-arrestin1 exhibited no effect on BNGR-A29 internalization (Fig. 7). We further investigated whether BNGR-A29 undergoes internalization via clathrin-coated pits using clathrin heavy chain-specific siRNA, and as also shown in Fig. 7, knockdown of the expression of clathrin heavy chain led to significant inhibition of AKH3-mediated BNGR-A29 internalization. These results suggest that the BNGR-A29 receptor undergoes rapid internalization via β-arrestin2- and clathrin-dependent pathways upon AKH3 stimulation. Furthermore, we used the endosome marker Alexa Fluor 546-labeled transferrin or the lysosome marker LysoTracker Red DND-99 to assess whether internalized AKHRs are generally degraded in lysosomes or recycled back to the plasma membrane via early and recycling endosomes. Confocal microscopy analysis revealed that the internalized BNGR-A29 receptors were co-localized with transferrin in endosomes but not with DND-99 in lysosomes (Fig. 8, A and B). The recycling experiments showed that the internalized BNGR-A29 receptors were recycled to the cell surface within 3 h after agonist removal (Fig. 8C). These data are highly consistent with our previous observation with AKHR internalization (26Huang H. Deng X. He X. Yang W. Li G. Shi Y. Shi L. Mei L. Gao J. Zhou N. Cell.

Responses to activated Gq in cardiomyocytes are mediated exclusively by phospholipase Cβ1b (PLCβ1b), because it localizes at the sarcolemma by binding to Shank3, a high-molecular-weight (MW) scaffolding protein. Shank3 can bind to the Homer family of low-MW scaffolding proteins that fine tune Ca2+ signaling by facilitating crosstalk between Ca2+ channels at the cell surface with those on intracellular Ca2+ stores. Activation of α1-adrenergic receptors, expression of constitutively active Gαq (GαqQL), or PLCβ1b initiated cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and increased Homer 1c mRNA expression, by 1.6 ± 0.18-, 1.9 ± 0.17-, and 1.5 ± 0.07-fold, respectively (means ± SE, 6 independent experiments, P<0.05). Expression of Homer 1c induced an increase in cardiomyocyte area from 853 ± 27 to 1146 ± 31 μm2 (P<0.05); furthermore, expression of dominant-negative Homer (Homer 1a) reversed the increase in cell size caused by α1-adrenergic agonist or PLCβ1b treatment (1503±48 to 996±28 and 1626±48 to 828±31 (μm2, respectively, P<0.05). Homer proteins were localized near the sarcolemma, associated with Shank3 and phospholipase Cβ1b. We conclude that Gq-mediated hypertrophy involves activation of PLCβ1b scaffolded onto a Shank3/Homer complex.

https://openalex.org/W2032042059,"LAPTM5 (lysosomal-associated protein multispanning transmembrane 5) is a membrane protein on the intracellular vesicles. We have previously demonstrated that the accumulation of LAPTM5-positive vesicles was closely associated with the programmed cell death occurring during the spontaneous regression of neuroblastomas.

IntroductionUbiquitination, the process by which ubiquitin is conjugated to Lys side chains of proteins, has emerged as the mechanism by which most intracellular proteins are targeted for lysosomal and proteasomal degradation, the two major proteolytic systems of the cell (1Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (6792) Google Scholar). The specificity of the ubiquitination reaction is achieved by the E3 ubiquitin ligases (E3), which mediate the transfer of ubiquitin from E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes (E2) to substrates.ITCH or AIP4 (atrophin-1-interacting protein 4, hereafter referred to as ITCH) belongs to the Nedd4-like family, which is characterized by a distinct modular domain architecture, with each member consisting of a calcium membrane targeting domain, two to four WW domains conferring substrate specificity, and a HECT-type ligase domain coordinating with E2 and providing the catalytic E3 activity (2Perry W.L.

ITCH contributes to many cellular processes by targeting the regulators of multiple signaling pathways (3Melino G. Gallagher E. Aqeilan R.I. Knight R. Peschiaroli A. Rossi M. Scialpi F. Malatesta M.

Additionally, it has been reported that ITCH was highly expressed in human cancers, including lymphomas, bladder cancer, and breast cancer, and may contribute to tumorigenesis by targeting tumor suppressors including p63, p73, and LATS (3Melino G.

LAPTM5 (lysosomal-associated protein multispanning transmembrane 5) is a membrane protein on the intracellular vesicles and regulates vesicle trafficking such as endocytosis (7Pak Y. Glowacka W.K.

We have recently suggested that the accumulation of LAPTM5-positive vesicles was closely associated with the programmed cell death occurring during the spontaneous regression of neuroblastomas (NBs) 3The abbreviations used are: NBneuroblastomaNi-NTAnickel-nitrilotriacetic acidAOacridine orangeITCHitchy E3 ubiquitin protein ligase homolog (mouse)HECTHomologous to the E6-AP carboxyl terminusLATSlarge tumor suppressor. and that the treatment with proteasomal and/or lysosomal inhibitors results in the accumulation of LAPTM5-positive vesicles and enhances LAPTM5-mediated cell death in NB cells (10Inoue J. Misawa A. Tanaka Y. Ichinose S. Sugino Y. Hosoi H. Sugimoto T. Imoto I. Inazawa J. PLoS One. 2009; 4e7099Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Thus, LAPTM5 protein is degraded by a proteasomal and/or lysosomal pathway; however, its molecular mechanism remains unknown.ITCH is involved in proteasomal and/or lysosomal degradation by interacting with the PPxY motif of substrate through a WW domain and by promoting ubiquitination through a HECT ligase domain (3Melino G. Gallagher E. Aqeilan R.I. Knight R. Peschiaroli A. Rossi M. Scialpi F. Malatesta M. Zocchi L. Browne G. Ciechanover A. Bernassola F. Cell Death Differ. 2008; 15: 1103-1112Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). LAPTM5 also has a PPxY motif within its C terminus. Hence, we examined whether LAPTM5 is a substrate for the protein degradation through ubiquitination by ITCH. We showed the physical interaction of these molecules through the WW domain of ITCH and PPxY motif of LAPTM5. This interaction resulted in the ubiquitination and the protein degradation of LAPTM5 in the proteasomal and/or lysosomal pathway. Moreover, inhibition of ITCH led to the stabilization of LAPTM5, resulting in the enhancement LAPTM5-mediated cell death in NB cells. Our findings suggest that ITCH negatively regulates the level of LAPTM5 protein through ubiquitin-mediated degradation.DISCUSSIONLAPTM5 is a membrane protein having five transmembrane domains and located on endosomes, lysosomes, or the intracellular vesicles transported from the Golgi to lysosomes (8Ouchida R.

A key finding in this study is that the ITCH E3 ligase catalyzes the ubiquitination of LAPTM5 by directly interacting with PPPY of LAPTM5 via its WW domain and negatively regulates the level of LAPTM5 protein. We have demonstrated previously that LAPTM5 protein is degraded in the proteasomal and lysosomal pathways (10Inoue J. Misawa A. Tanaka Y. Ichinose S. Sugino Y. Hosoi H. Sugimoto T. Imoto I. Inazawa J. PLoS One. 2009; 4e7099Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). It has been demonstrated that LAPTM5 has an essential role for the lysosomal degradation of T cell and B cell receptors through the transport of endosomes to lysosomes (8Ouchida R. Kurosaki T. Wang J.Y. J. Immunol. 2010; 185: 294-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 9Ouchida R. Yamasaki S. Hikida M. Masuda K. Kawamura K. Wada A. Mochizuki S. Tagawa M. Sakamoto A. Hatano M.

In addition, NEDD4-1, a HECT-type E3 ligase, which belongs to the Nedd4 family along with ITCH, could also interact with the PPPY motif of LAPTM5 via its WW domain, and the interaction of these proteins is critical for the transport of intracellular vesicles from the Golgi to lysosome (7Pak Y. Glowacka W.K. Bruce M.C. Pham N. Rotin D. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 175: 631-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Thus, LAPTM5 protein is degraded by not only the proteasomal system but also the lysosomal system through transport into lysosome of LAPTM5-positive vesicles. However, it has been known that ITCH promotes not only the proteasomal degradation but also the lysosomal degradation of membrane proteins on the endosome, such as Melan-A, ErbB4, and CXCR4, through ubiquitination of those substrates (18Lévy F.

In general, the receptors for growth factors and chemokines are internalized by endocytosis in the response to stimuli, and the generated endosomes are transported into the lysosomes for removal or into the cellular membrane for recycling (21David R. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2011; 12: 135Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar). Taken together, ITCH may associate with not only the proteasomal degradation of LAPTM5 protein but also the lysosomal removal of LAPTM5-positive vesicles by ubiquitinated LAPTM5 protein. Although we found that ITCH catalyzes the poly- and monoubiquitination of LAPTM5 in this study, it is unclear for its physiological significance. This differential status for ubiquitination (mono or poly) may contribute to the mark for proteasomal or lysosomal degradation. Indeed, it has been suggested that monoubiquitination by ITCH promotes the lysosomal degradation of the substrates such as ErbB4 or CXCR4 (19Sundvall M. Korhonen A. Paatero I. Gaudio E. Melino G.

The clinical behavior of NB is heterogeneous: the tumors found in patients under 1 year of age are favorable due to spontaneous regression via programmed cell death; the tumors found in older children often grow rapidly to become fatal, despite intensive chemotherapy (22Brodeur G.M. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 203-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (1666) Google Scholar, 23Schwab M. Westermann F. Hero B. Berthold F.

Thus, to develop a breakthrough in therapy against advanced tumors, which cannot regress spontaneously, it is important to understand the molecular mechanisms for the spontaneous regression of NBs. Recently, we found that the accumulation of LAPTM5-positive vesicles often occurred in dying NB cells within regressing area on the tissue section from favorable NB tumors and that the exogenous expression of LAPTM5 led to the gradual accumulation of LAPTM5-positive vesicles and induced cell death in NB cells (10Inoue J. Misawa A. Tanaka Y. Ichinose S. Sugino Y. Hosoi H. Sugimoto T. Imoto I. Inazawa J. PLoS One. 2009; 4e7099Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Importantly, we have observed that those LAPTM5-positive vesicles accumulated remarkably by the treatment with a proteasomal or lysosomal inhibitors, strongly suggesting that the dysregulation of these degradation systems might be associated with the induction of cell death occurred by the accumulation of LAPTM5-positive vesicles in NB cells. In this study, we demonstrated that the inhibition of ITCH led to the accumulation of LAPTM5 protein and enhanced LAPTM5-mediated cell death in NB cells. Thus, inactivation of ITCH may be a trigger for spontaneous regression of NB tumor by inducing LAPTM5-mediated cell death in NB cells. Further examination will be required to clarify the physiological association with ITCH and LAPTM5 for tumorigenesis of NB tumors.We showed the stabilization of LAPTM5 protein by ITCH inhibition in KYSE410 cells, an esophageal squamous cell carcinoma cell line, which is expressed endogenous LAPTM5 at the transcriptional level, but we could not detect the cell death in this case. This result suggests that ITCH contributes to the degradation of LAPTM5 protein at the physiological condition, and it may be needed the chronic inhibition of ITCH to induce the cell death occurred by accumulation of endogenous LAPTM5. Furthermore, we could not detect the increase in the level of endogenous LAPTM5 protein by ITCH inhibition in 8305C cells showing amplification and overexpression of ITCH (4Ishihara T. Tsuda H. Hotta A. Kozaki K. Yoshida A. Noh J.Y. Ito K. Imoto I. Inazawa J. Cancer Sci. 2008; 99: 1940-1949PubMed Google Scholar) due to the low level of LAPTM5 mRNA in this cells (data not shown). Thus, the function of ITCH as a negative regulator of LAPTM5 protein might be exerted under specific conditions where the transcription of LAPTM5 is activated. Indeed, our preliminary data have showed that LAPTM5 was transcriptionally up-regulated by stimuli, including cell differentiation and cellular stress. Thus, to further characterize LAPTM5-mediated cell death, it is important to determine the cellular condition for the accumulation of LAPTM5 protein.

The specificity of the ubiquitination reaction is achieved by the E3 ubiquitin ligases (E3), which mediate the transfer of ubiquitin from E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes (E2) to substrates.ITCH or AIP4 (atrophin-1-interacting protein 4, hereafter referred to as ITCH) belongs to the Nedd4-like family, which is characterized by a distinct modular domain architecture, with each member consisting of a calcium membrane targeting domain, two to four WW domains conferring substrate specificity, and a HECT-type ligase domain coordinating with E2 and providing the catalytic E3 activity (2Perry W.L.

ITCH contributes to many cellular processes by targeting the regulators of multiple signaling pathways (3Melino G. Gallagher E. Aqeilan R.I. Knight R. Peschiaroli A. Rossi M. Scialpi F. Malatesta M. Zocchi L. Browne G. Ciechanover A. Bernassola F.

Additionally, it has been reported that ITCH was highly expressed in human cancers, including lymphomas, bladder cancer, and breast cancer, and may contribute to tumorigenesis by targeting tumor suppressors including p63, p73, and LATS (3Melino G.

LAPTM5 (lysosomal-associated protein multispanning transmembrane 5) is a membrane protein on the intracellular vesicles and regulates vesicle trafficking such as endocytosis (7Pak Y. Glowacka W.K. Bruce M.C. Pham N. Rotin D. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 175: 631-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 8Ouchida R. Kurosaki T. Wang J.Y. J.

We have recently suggested that the accumulation of LAPTM5-positive vesicles was closely associated with the programmed cell death occurring during the spontaneous regression of neuroblastomas (NBs) 3The abbreviations used are: NBneuroblastomaNi-NTAnickel-nitrilotriacetic acidAOacridine orangeITCHitchy E3 ubiquitin protein ligase homolog (mouse)HECTHomologous to the E6-AP carboxyl terminusLATSlarge tumor suppressor. and that the treatment with proteasomal and/or lysosomal inhibitors results in the accumulation of LAPTM5-positive vesicles and enhances LAPTM5-mediated cell death in NB cells (10Inoue J. Misawa A. Tanaka Y. Ichinose S. Sugino Y. Hosoi H. Sugimoto T. Imoto I. Inazawa J. PLoS One. 2009; 4e7099Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Thus, LAPTM5 protein is degraded by a proteasomal and/or lysosomal pathway; however, its molecular mechanism remains unknown.ITCH is involved in proteasomal and/or lysosomal degradation by interacting with the PPxY motif of substrate through a WW domain and by promoting ubiquitination through a HECT ligase domain (3Melino G. Gallagher E. Aqeilan R.I. Knight R. Peschiaroli A. Rossi M. Scialpi F. Malatesta M. Zocchi L. Browne G. Ciechanover A. Bernassola F. Cell Death Differ. 2008; 15: 1103-1112Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). LAPTM5 also has a PPxY motif within its C terminus. Hence, we examined whether LAPTM5 is a substrate for the protein degradation through ubiquitination by ITCH. We showed the physical interaction of these molecules through the WW domain of ITCH and PPxY motif of LAPTM5. This interaction resulted in the ubiquitination and the protein degradation of LAPTM5 in the proteasomal and/or lysosomal pathway. Moreover, inhibition of ITCH led to the stabilization of LAPTM5, resulting in the enhancement LAPTM5-mediated cell death in NB cells. Our findings suggest that ITCH negatively regulates the level of LAPTM5 protein through ubiquitin-mediated degradation."

Although transcription of LMP1 in latent type III cells is generally under the control of the viral coactivator EBNA2, little is known about EBNA2-independent LMP1 expression in type II latency. We thus screened a cDNA library for factors that can activate the LMP1 promoter in an EBNA2-independent manner, using a reporter assay system. So far, we have screened >20,000 clones, and here identified C/EBPε as a new transcriptional activator. Exogenous expression of C/EBPα, -β, or -ε efficiently augmented LMP1 mRNA and protein levels in EBV-positive cell lines, whereas other members of the C/EBP family exhibited modest or little activity. It has been demonstrated that LMP1 gene transcription depends on two promoter regions: proximal (ED-L1) and distal (TR-L1). Interestingly, although we first used the proximal promoter for screening, we found that C/EBP increased transcription from both promoters in latent EBV-positive cells. Mutagenesis in reporter assays and EMSA identified only one functional C/EBP binding site, through which activation of both proximal and distal promoters is mediated. Introduction of point mutations into the identified C/EBP site in EBV-BAC caused reduced LMP1 transcription from both LMP1 promoters in epithelial cells. In conclusion, C/EBP is a newly identified transcriptional activator of the LMP1 gene, independent of the EBNA2 coactivator."
https://openalex.org/W2106085008,"Little is known about the identities and functions of extracellular signaling molecules that work in concert with neuronal activity to regulate refinement and maintenance of the mouse olfactory sensory map. We show that expression of a dominant negative retinoic acid receptor (RAR) in olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) increased the number of glomeruli that incorrectly contained OSN axons expressing different odorant receptors. This phenotype became apparent postnatally, coincided with increased cell death, and was preceded by increased Neuropilin-1 and reduced Kir-rel-2 expressions. Kirrel-2-mediated cell adhesion influences odorant receptor-specific axonal convergence and is regulated by odorant receptor signaling via the olfactory cyclic nucleotide-gated (CNG) ion channel. Accordingly, we found that inhibited RAR function correlated with reduced CNG channel expression. Naris occlusion experiments and analysis of CNG channeldeficient mice further indicated that RAR-regulated CNG channel levels influenced the intrinsic neuronal activity required for cell survival in the absence of odor stimulation. Finally, we showed that CNG channel activity regulated expression of the retinoic acid-degrading enzyme Cyp26B1. Combined, these results identify a novel homeostatic feedback mechanism involving retinoic acid metabolism and CNG channel activity, which influences glomerular homogeneity and maintenance of precisely connected OSNs.—Öztokatli, H., Hörnberg, M., Berghard, A., Bohm, S.

The catalytic apparatus of PutAs consists of an FAD-dependent proline dehydrogenase (PRODH) active site that catalyzes the oxidation of proline to Δ1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate (P5C), and an NAD+-dependent P5C dehydrogenase (P5CDH) active site that catalyzes the oxidation of glutamate semialdehyde to glutamate (Fig. 1). These two reactions are linked by a hydrolysis step that converts P5C into glutamate semialdehyde.In addition, some PutAs provide genetic regulation by acting as transcriptional repressors, thereby establishing a class of trifunctional PutAs (3Menzel R.

EcPutA controls the expression of the put regulon, which contains the genes encoding EcPutA and the proline transporter PutP. When proline levels are low, EcPutA blocks transcription by binding to operator sites located between the two divergently transcribed genes. Increased proline levels cause EcPutA to dissociate from DNA and bind the inner membrane, which activates gene transcription, uptake of proline, and proline catabolic enzymatic activity. The mechanism by which proline stimulates proline utilization, e.g. functional switching, involves global conformational changes induced by proline reduction of the FAD, which enhance membrane binding affinity and shift the equilibrium of PutA from DNA-bound to membrane-associated. Thus, trifunctional PutAs are dynamic proteins that function both as a sensor that monitors the level of environmental proline and a transducer that converts proline into usable energy for the organism.The crystal structure of a bifunctional PutA is known (18Srivastava D. Schuermann J.P. White T.A. Krishnan N. Sanyal N. Hura G.L. Tan A. Henzl M.T. Becker D.F. Tanner J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 2878-2883Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) (supplemental Fig. S1). At 999 residues, PutA from Bradyrhizobium japonicum (BjPutA) is among the smallest of PutAs and is therefore considered to be a minimalist PutA. The PRODH active site is located in a (βα)8 barrel, whereas the P5CDH site resides in a crevice between the Rossmann-like NAD+-binding domain and the catalytic domain that furnishes the essential reactive Cys. The two active sites are separated by 41 Å and connected by a large, irregularly shaped internal cavity (silver surface in supplemental Fig. S1A). It has been hypothesized that the cavity functions in substrate channeling by serving as an internal reaction vessel for the hydrolysis of P5C to glutamate semialdehyde and a protected conduit for the diffusion of the semialdehyde to the P5CDH active site. In addition to the catalytic domains, the structure includes four ancillary domains (arm, α, linker, and oligomerization) that not only help to create the aforementioned cavity, but also provide the sites for oligomerization. Of particular note for the current work is the oligomerization domain.The oligomerization domain of BjPutA is a bipartite flap consisting of a β-hairpin and the C-terminal ∼20 residues of the chain (supplemental Fig. S1A, orange). The latter part of the oligomerization domain forms a β-strand followed by a turn of α-helix and contains the conserved sequence motif EXXXXv(N or D)t(T or A)AaGGnaXL, where uppercase, lowercase, and X indicate identical, highly conserved, and any residue, respectively. The sequence appears to be in all branch 1 PutAs, a group that includes both BjPutA and trifunctional PutAs (1Tanner J.J. Amino Acids. 2008; 35: 719-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). BjPutA forms a domain-swapped dimer in which the flap of one protomer forms main chain hydrogen bonds with the β-sheet of the catalytic domain of the other protomer (supplemental Fig. S1B). As a consequence of dimerization, the flap of one protomer seals the cavity of the other protomer from the bulk medium preventing loss of the intermediate (supplemental Fig. S1C).Trifunctional PutAs have two additional domains not found in the minimalist PutA (Fig. 2). The DNA-binding domain (residues 1–49) has a ribbon helix helix (RHH) fold and forms the canonical RHH dimer in solution (9Zhou Y. Larson J.D. Bottoms C.A. Arturo E.C. Henzl M.T. Jenkins J.L.

The other extra domain (CTD, C-terminal domain) has ∼200 residues and is inserted between the NAD+-binding domain and the predicted conserved C-terminal motif. The function of the CTD is unknown.FIGURE 2Schematic diagram depicting a multiple sequence alignment of minimalist PutAs, represented by BjPutA (top), and trifunctional PutAs, represented by EcPutA (bottom).

Biochemistry. 2010; 49: 560-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) domains of EcPutA are known, the three-dimensional structure of a full-length trifunctional PutA has remained elusive since the discovery of PutAs in the late 1970s (23Ratzkin B. Roth J. J. Bacteriol. 1978; 133: 744-754Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Here, we report small-angle x-ray scattering (SAXS) studies of EcPutA, which provide the first view of the three-dimensional architecture of a trifunctional PutA.DISCUSSIONThe oligomeric states and quaternary structures of PutAs are not conserved. To date, the oligomeric states of just two PutAs have been determined using rigorous biophysical methods. Almost 20 years ago, Brown and Wood (24Brown E.D. Wood J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13086-13092Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) used sedimentation and light scattering to show that EcPutA forms a dimer in solution. We confirmed this result using MALS and SAXS. Last year, we reported SAXS and equilibrium sedimentation data showing that BjPutA, a minimalist bifunctional PutA, forms a ring-shaped, dimer-of-dimers tetramer having 222 symmetry (18Srivastava D. Schuermann J.P. White T.A. Krishnan N. Sanyal N. Hura G.L. Tan A. Henzl M.T. Becker D.F. Tanner J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 2878-2883Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Thus, despite nearly 50% amino acid sequence identity, these two PutAs have different oligomeric states.Considering the high identity between EcPutA and BjPutA, one might hypothesize that the EcPutA dimer resembles one of the three 2-body assemblies of the BjPutA tetramer. However, the Rg values of those assemblies are 44.8, 44.3, and 47.5 Å, which are much smaller than the Rg of 63 Å for EcPutA. Furthermore, the P(r) curves calculated from the BjPutA assemblies are distinctly different from that of EcPutA (supplemental Fig. S5). In particular, the distributions of vectors in the BjPutA dimers lack the prominent shoulder at 110 Å, suggesting that the catalytic units are farther apart in EcPutA than in BjPutA. In fact, if two BjPutA protomers are separated as in rigid body model 1, the resulting P(r) exhibits the characteristic bimodal shape of EcPutA (supplemental Fig. S5, dashed curve). We thus conclude that neither the oligomeric state nor the quaternary structure are conserved in the PutA family.This lack of conservation perhaps makes sense considering the additional function of EcPutA as a transcriptional repressor, which requires dimerization of the DNA-binding domain. Indeed, the DNA-binding domain was found here to be essential for dimerization of EcPutA. The connecting cylinder of the SAXS envelope accommodates the RHH dimer, but is not large enough to fit additional domains, suggesting that the DNA-binding domain is the sole dimerization domain. Thus, it appears that function trumps homology in determining the oligomeric state and quaternary structure of PutA.DNA is predicted to bind in the trench on the concave surface of the protein (supplemental Fig. S6). The model is consistent with structural data on EcPutA-DNA association. In particular, side chains of the RHH domain that are known to contact DNA (9Zhou Y. Larson J.D. Bottoms C.A. Arturo E.C. Henzl M.T. Jenkins J.L. Nix J.C. Becker D.F. Tanner J.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2008; 381: 174-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) are solvent exposed in the SAXS model. These critical residues are located in the β-strand (residues 5, 7, and 9) and N terminus of the second helix of the RHH-fold (residues 28–30). The model suggests the hypothesis that elements outside of the RHH domain, such as residues in α domain and PRODH barrel, may influence DNA binding. The SAXS model also provides new insights into the redox-dependent transcriptional regulation of the putA and putP genes by EcPutA. The 419-bp put control DNA region was previously shown to have five operator sites, with two of the operators (sites 3 and 4) separated by only one nucleotide (9Zhou Y. Larson J.D. Bottoms C.A. Arturo E.C. Henzl M.T. Jenkins J.L. Nix J.C. Becker D.F. Tanner J.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2008; 381: 174-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The mode of DNA binding predicted in our model (supplemental Fig. S6) suggests that PutA binding to sites 3 or 4 preclude binding at the neighboring operator sequence. Thus, PutA most likely binds only four operator sites at one time to repress transcription of the putA and putP genes.Consideration of the SAXS data in the context of existing biochemical and biophysical data on EcPutA provides a new model for gene regulation by EcPutA. Previous studies showed that reduction of the FAD causes just a 2-fold increase in the dissociation constant of PutA with put control DNA (11Becker D.F. Thomas E.A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 4714-4721Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), indicating that the FAD redox state has little influence on the intrinsic affinity of EcPutA for DNA. On the other hand, reduction of FAD increases the binding constant for membrane association by several orders of magnitude (15Zhang W. Zhou Y. Becker D.F. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 13165-13174Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Essentially, oxidized EcPutA has negligible affinity for the membrane, whereas the reduced protein exhibits nanomolar affinity. Two studies have shown that membrane binding and DNA binding are mutually exclusive (15Zhang W. Zhou Y. Becker D.F. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 13165-13174Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 44Muro-Pastor A.M. Ostrovsky P. Maloy S. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 2788-2791Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, limited proteolysis and Trp fluorescence studies of EcPutA showed that FAD reduction induces a conformational change in the α domain, implying that reduction of the flavin triggers a global conformational change involving, in part, the α domain, that causes EcPutA to switch from being a transcriptional repressor to membrane-bound enzyme (13Zhu W. Becker D.F. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 5469-5477Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 17Zhu W. Becker D.F. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 12297-12306Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar).A new model of gene regulation that is consistent with these observations and the SAXS model is that the DNA-binding and membrane-association interfaces are located on the same face of the protein, and that in the oxidized state, the former interface is exposed, whereas the latter is concealed. Reduction of FAD induces a conformational change that exposes the high affinity membrane-binding interface without disrupting the DNA-binding interface. The unveiling of the membrane-binding interface drives EcPutA to the membrane surface, which hides the DNA-binding interface from the put regulon thereby activating gene transcription. In SAXS model 1, the DNA-binding interface and both α domains are located on the same face of the protein, i.e. the concave face (Fig. 7B). We thus hypothesize that the concave face of EcPutA supports both DNA- and membrane-binding, enabling a cloaking mechanism of gene regulation.The SAXS model also provides insight into the nature of the global conformational changes associated with functional switching. The V-shape of oxidized EcPutA suggests hinge bending analogous to the ν2 normal mode of water as a natural degree of freedom. Bending in one direction (closing) brings the α domains closer together and narrows the DNA-binding trench, resulting in a less elongated particle. Hinge bending in the opposite direction (opening) extends and flattens the dimer. Whether reduction of the FAD closes or opens the hinge is difficult to predict, but it may be possible to distinguish between these two general models for redox-linked conformational change using SAXS of reduced EcPutA and fluorescence resonance energy transfer of labeled EcPutA.Spatial separation of the P5CDH domains, as in our rigid body models, is unprecedented in the aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) gene superfamily. The superfamily includes NAD(P)+-dependent enzymes catalyzing the oxidation of a variety of aldehyde substrates to their corresponding carboxylic acids (45Sophos N.A. Vasiliou V. Chem. Biol. Interact. 2003; 143–144: 5-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar, 46Yoshida A. Rzhetsky A. Hsu L.C. Chang C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 251: 549-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). P5CDHs belong to the ALDH4 family. Crystal structures of several ALDHs are known (47Liu Z.J. Sun Y.J. Rose J. Chung Y.J. Hsiao C.D. Chang W.R. Kuo I. Perozich J. Lindahl R. Hempel J. Wang B.C. Nat.

All feature a 3-domain tertiary structure consisting of a Rossmann-like cofactor-binding domain (also called the N domain), a catalytic domain that furnishes the reactive Cys (also called the C domain), and an oligomerization flap domain formed by a β-hairpin and C-terminal β-strand. BjPutA and the monofunctional P5CDH from Thermus thermophilus (50Inagaki E. Ohshima N. Takahashi H. Kuroishi C. Yokoyama S. Tahirov T.H. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 362: 490-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) exhibit this defining architecture. The known structures also show that ALDHs form a domain-swapped dimer in which the oligomerization domain of one protomer interacts with the catalytic domain of the other protomer as in supplemental Fig. S1C. In some ALDHs, the domain-swapped dimers assemble to form tetramers (48Moore S.A. Baker H.M. Blythe T.J. Kitson K.E. Kitson T.M. Baker E.N. Structure. 1998; 6: 1541-1551Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 49Steinmetz C.G. Xie P. Weiner H. Hurley T.D.

Biol. 2006; 362: 490-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar).The domain deletion and SAXS data suggest that dimerization of EcPutA is not mediated by traditional ALDH oligomerization flap domains. Although unprecedented in the ALDH superfamily, this result is consistent with multiple sequence alignments. In particular, the alignments clearly show that the β-hairpin of the minimalist PutA (residues 633–648) is truncated in trifunctional PutAs (supplemental Fig. S2, orange box). Consequently, we hypothesize that the ALDH domains of trifunctional PutAs do not have the traditional dimerization flap seen in other ALDHs. Rather, our results suggest that trifunctional PutAs are unique members of the ALDH superfamily because of their mode of dimerization.Finally, our results provide insight into the function of the CTD. The observation that PutA1–1085 is dimeric suggests that the CTD is not involved in dimerization. Remote homology detection analysis suggests that the CTD is homologous to the Rossmann domain of ALDHs. For example, HHSearch (35Arnold K. Bordoli L. Kopp J. Schwede T. Bioinformatics. 2006; 22: 195-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (5980) Google Scholar) identifies 33 ALDHs with probability scores of 99.1–99.9%, with the top match being BjPutA (probability = 99.9%, E-value = 7.7E-26). The alignment shows that the CTD of EcPutA is 25% identical to residues 551–761 of BjPutA (Fig. 2). Of particular note is the prediction that CTD residues 1175–1190 (supplemental Fig. S2, green box) form an ALDH β-hairpin homologous to the one found in BjPutA residues 633–648. As noted above, the substrate channeling cavity is open to the bulk medium in the SAXS models, which is inconsistent with the observation that PutAs exhibit several kinetic signatures of substrate channeling (18Srivastava D. Schuermann J.P. White T.A. Krishnan N. Sanyal N. Hura G.L. Tan A. Henzl M.T. Becker D.F. Tanner J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Becker, unpublished results. These results suggest the hypothesis that the CTD occupies the vacant space in the SAXS envelope between the two active sites (arrows in lower part of Fig. 7B), thereby forming an intramolecular lid analogous to the intermolecular lid of BjPutA. Future studies will be needed to test this, and other, hypotheses raised by the model of EcPutA proposed here.

Amino Acids. 2008; 35: 711-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The catalytic apparatus of PutAs consists of an FAD-dependent proline dehydrogenase (PRODH) active site that catalyzes the oxidation of proline to Δ1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate (P5C), and an NAD+-dependent P5C dehydrogenase (P5CDH) active site that catalyzes the oxidation of glutamate semialdehyde to glutamate (Fig. 1). These two reactions are linked by a hydrolysis step that converts P5C into glutamate semialdehyde.In addition, some PutAs provide genetic regulation by acting as transcriptional repressors, thereby establishing a class of trifunctional PutAs (3Menzel R.

Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 12297-12306Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). EcPutA controls the expression of the put regulon, which contains the genes encoding EcPutA and the proline transporter PutP. When proline levels are low, EcPutA blocks transcription by binding to operator sites located between the two divergently transcribed genes. Increased proline levels cause EcPutA to dissociate from DNA and bind the inner membrane, which activates gene transcription, uptake of proline, and proline catabolic enzymatic activity. The mechanism by which proline stimulates proline utilization, e.g. functional switching, involves global conformational changes induced by proline reduction of the FAD, which enhance membrane binding affinity and shift the equilibrium of PutA from DNA-bound to membrane-associated. Thus, trifunctional PutAs are dynamic proteins that function both as a sensor that monitors the level of environmental proline and a transducer that converts proline into usable energy for the organism.The crystal structure of a bifunctional PutA is known (18Srivastava D. Schuermann J.P. White T.A. Krishnan N. Sanyal N. Hura G.L. Tan A. Henzl M.T. Becker D.F. Tanner J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

https://openalex.org/W2086053237,"The small neuroendocrine protein 7B2 is required for the production of active prohormone convertase 2 (PC2), an enzyme involved in the synthesis of peptide hormones, such as glucagon and proopiomelanocortin-derived α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone. However, whether 7B2 can dynamically modulate peptide production through regulation of PC2 activity remains unclear. Infection of the pancreatic alpha cell line α-TC6 with 7B2-encoding adenovirus efficiently increased production of glucagon, whereas siRNA-mediated knockdown of 7B2 significantly decreased stored glucagon. Furthermore, rescue of 7B2 expression in primary pituitary cultures prepared from 7B2 null mice restored melanocyte-stimulating hormone production, substantiating the role of 7B2 as a regulatory factor in peptide biosynthesis. In anterior pituitary and pancreatic beta cell lines, however, overexpression of 7B2 affected neither production nor secretion of peptides despite increased release of active PC2. In direct contrast, 7B2 overexpression decreased the secretion and increased the activity of PC2 within α-TC6 cells; the increased intracellular concentration of active PC2 within these cells may therefore account for the enhanced production of glucagon. In line with these findings, we found elevated circulating glucagon levels in 7B2-overexpressing cast/cast mice in vivo. Surprisingly, when proopiomelanocortin and proglucagon were co-expressed in either pituitary or pancreatic alpha cell lines, proglucagon processing was preferentially decreased when 7B2 was knocked down. Taken together, these results suggest that proglucagon cleavage has a greater dependence on PC2 activity than other precursors and moreover that 7B2-dependent routing of PC2 to secretory granules is cell line-specific. The manipulation of 7B2 could therefore represent an effective way to selectively regulate synthesis of certain PC2-dependent peptides."
https://openalex.org/W2144604888,"Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is caused by the lack of a functional dystrophin protein that results in muscle fiber membrane disruption and, ultimately, degeneration. Regeneration of muscle fibers fails progressively, and muscle tissue is replaced with connective tissue. As a result, DMD causes progressive limb muscle weakness and cardiac and respiratory failure. The absence of dystrophin from muscle fibers triggers the chronic activation of the nuclear factor of kappa B (NF-κB). Chronic activation of NF-κB in muscle leads to infiltration of macrophages, up-regulation of the ubiquitin-proteosome system, and down-regulation of the helix-loop-helix muscle regulatory factor, MyoD. These processes, triggered by NF-κB activation, promote muscle degeneration and failure of muscle regeneration. A20 (TNFAIP3) is a critical negative regulator of NF-κB. In this study, we characterize the role of A20 in regulating NF-κB activation in skeletal muscle, identifying a novel role in muscle regeneration. A20 is highly expressed in regenerating muscle fibers, and knockdown of A20 impairs muscle differentiation in vitro, which suggests that A20 expression is critically important for regeneration of dystrophic muscle tissue. Furthermore, down-regulation of the classic pathway of NF-κB activation is associated with up-regulation of the alternate pathway in regenerating muscle fibers, suggesting a mechanism by which A20 promotes muscle regeneration. These results demonstrate the important role of A20 in muscle fiber repair and suggest the potential of A20 as a therapeutic target to ameliorate the pathology and clinical symptoms of DMD."
https://openalex.org/W2092811626,"Health monitoring of world economy is an important issue, especially in a time of profound economic difficulty world-wide. The most important aspect of health monitoring is to accurately predict economic downturns. To gain insights into how economic crises develop, we present two metrics, positive and negative income entropy and distribution analysis, to analyze the collective “spatial” and temporal dynamics of companies in nine sectors of the world economy over a 19 year period from 1990–2008. These metrics provide accurate predictive skill with a very low false-positive rate in predicting downturns. The new metrics also provide evidence of phase transition-like behavior prior to the onset of recessions. Such a transition occurs when negative pretax incomes prior to or during economic recessions transition from a thin-tailed exponential distribution to the higher entropy Pareto distribution, and develop even heavier tails than those of the positive pretax incomes. These features propagate from the crisis initiating sector of the economy to other sectors."
